[21:09] couple years and he and I over the last
[21:11] two years have come very close and
[21:14] talking about the
[21:16] Lord and um I heard that he was buying a
[21:19] house or I thought he had closed on it
[21:21] and everything was Final and then on
[21:24] Friday of last week he called me in his
[21:26] office at 10:30 and he said 11:00 I want
[21:29] you to pray he says cuz I believe you
[21:30] have a direct contact with
[21:33] God and we know that the bride does Amen
[21:36] but I'm giving all the honor and glory
[21:38] to God about this it's not about me it's
[21:40] what he can do for those who don't
[21:42] understand but there was a I didn't know
[21:44] what the problem was at the time and if
[21:47] you've had any dealings in real estate
[21:49] there's always an issue if there's an
[21:51] issue or surveying or landay there's
[21:53] always going to be a real hassle so I
[21:57] didn't know that was the problem but he
[21:58] told me to pray at 11:00 so I called
[22:00] Howen Audrey and Janet real quick and I
[22:03] said I don't know what's going on but I
[22:04] want everybody to pray at
[22:06] 11: and that's the last I'd heard until
[22:08] 2:30 to say uh in that afternoon I got a
[22:11] text from him saying that he said you
[22:14] surely have contact with God he said
[22:17] there was a woman that they they began
[22:19] making calls real estate people began
[22:21] making calls of people around the area
[22:23] and asked if they had the same issue
[22:24] with the problem with the land with the
[22:27] creek beside the property and this woman
[22:29] said this must be of God this is what

[22:37] walk my dog and I am a real estate uh

[32:42] you come and speak to our hearts God we
[32:44] love you and we thank you in Jesus name
[32:49] amen Ephesians
[32:53] 1 verse
[32:55] three blessed be the god God and father
[32:57] of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed
[32:59] us with all spiritual blessings in
[33:01] Heavenly places in Christ according as
[33:04] he have chosen Us in him before the
[33:06] foundation of the world that we should
[33:08] be holy and Without Blame before him in
[33:10] love having predestinated us unto the
[33:13] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[33:16] himself according to the good pleasure
[33:18] of his will to the praise of the glory
[33:21] of his grace wherein he hath made us
[33:24] accepted in the Beloved right let's go
[33:27] over to to uh 1 Peter
[33:33] 2 1 Peter 2 and we'll begin verse
[33:39] one wherefore laying aside all malice
[33:42] and all gu and hypocrisies and envies
[33:44] and all evil speakings as newborn babes
[33:48] desire the sincere milk of the word that
[33:50] we may that ye may grow
[33:53] thereby if so that ye have tasted that
[33:56] the Lord is gracious I to whom coming as
[33:58] unto a living Stone this allowed indeed
[34:00] of men but chosen of God and precious ye
[34:05] also as Lively stones are build up a
[34:08] spiritual house and holy priesthood to
[34:11] offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable
[34:14] to God by Jesus Christ you may be seated
[34:18] the Lord at is blessing to the reading
[34:20] of the word
[34:22] now I'm trying
[34:25] to you know
[34:28] get us to an understanding and and all
[34:30] on what the hour that we're living cuz
[34:33] that's the main thing to me is a present
[34:35] tense gospel you know and to do that see
[34:39] sometimes we have to look over the uh
[34:42] life and existence and things like that
[34:44] and look and see what God says and and
[34:47] believe it and and keep on walking in in
[34:50] that point now I was trying to make a
[34:54] definite point this morning about uh you
[34:58] know and I said we'd be in adoption and
[35:01] we just put the title I told Brother
[35:02] Joseph just put it adoption in three
[35:05] stages and we'll go with that part 1 2 3
[35:07] 4 until we finish what we're wanting to
[35:11] cover and all and you know everybody
[35:13] wants to go on over to the adoptions and
[35:16] things and you know the the great
[35:18] manifestations and stuff like that but I
[35:21] want us to be just as simple as we can
[35:23] try to continue you know go through and
[35:26] see this the the stages of adoption and
[35:29] covering it like we did on the life of
[35:31] our will on the life of Jesus Christ to
[35:34] where that he was
[35:36] identified there see you know this is my
[35:39] beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell
[35:41] all right he was identified he he was
[35:43] put forth to the world to be shown by as
[35:45] I said this morning his his baptismal
[35:48] service because it was necessary that
[35:51] he'd be baptized to wash the sacrifice
[35:54] and everything would be ready you know
[35:56] and all like that because he would would
[35:58] do that and then in his life we have the
[36:01] example see to where we can follow it
[36:04] and and we see that we start our journey
[36:06] of a Christian Journey as our water
[36:08] baptism too right you know we we start
[36:11] out as as that and and it's necessary
[36:13] that we uh be baptized in the name of
[36:16] the Lord Jesus Christ and that way it
[36:18] would bring the promises of God to us to
[36:21] where that we can you know see those
[36:23] things and I I I want you to see that
[36:25] but I want you to think about the and
[36:27] keep it as simple as
[36:30] possible and and now this afternoon
[36:33] we're not going to deal with nothing but
[36:35] just trying to see how that we become
[36:37] the children of God right you say well
[36:39] we understand this we understand that
[36:41] well a lot of people don't and maybe
[36:44] sometimes we think we do and maybe we
[36:46] don't understand what we need to know
[36:49] about these things and trying to to make
[36:52] it as simple as possible to to deal with
[36:55] that the because you know as I said the
[36:58] Lord Jesus he didn't need a new birth
[37:01] right so he didn't go through those
[37:02] things to to do but God still came down
[37:07] and United himself with him there on the
[37:10] River Jordan as we talk about you know
[37:13] the his baptismal part and I do believe
[37:17] in that I believe that that was when
[37:19] that you know the spirit of God
[37:21] descended the Holy Spirit descended Upon
[37:24] Jesus Christ and is it then it was
[37:27] proclaiming him to be who he was and and
[37:31] that would be bringing him to the to the
[37:34] point that he needed to be all right
[37:36] because he needed to be recognized right
[37:39] you know and and it was done before the
[37:41] world well I believe that that you know
[37:44] ever born again
[37:46] believer that you know has the New Birth
[37:49] that and that is the you know to be born
[37:52] again is to have the new birth I believe
[37:54] that identifies Us in the the body of
[37:57] Christ amen all right that's what I want
[37:59] you to see and just kind of just hold it
[38:01] on that point and then we'll pick up
[38:03] more going along you know of our our
[38:06] stages of our journey but just think
[38:09] about your life and and the things that
[38:12] you do you remember how I've always told
[38:14] you that the way that I check a
[38:17] Doctrine how is it that I check a
[38:19] Doctrine by my new
[38:22] birth well I check it by the word
[38:25] well
[38:27] blent I've heard a lot of people say
[38:29] that I just tell it like it is if it
[38:33] don't if what a man is preaching doesn't
[38:35] compare with what God has done in my
[38:37] life right in my new birth right then I
[38:42] I just can't believe it I'm sorry I've
[38:44] told people that I'd say well I'm sorry
[38:46] I just can't see what you're talking
[38:47] about because it's not a not a point of
[38:50] argument it's just if I don't see it I'm
[38:53] not going to tell you yeah I see it you
[38:55] know that's well a lot of people you
[38:57] know they'll
[38:58] be standing around and somebody say do
[39:00] you see that yeah I think I see it you
[39:02] know looking up at something you know
[39:04] like that but they're just faking it
[39:06] they're not really seeing it I want to
[39:08] see it for myself amen you know in that
[39:11] way that I know that I've got it I don't
[39:12] have to worry about it see I like to to
[39:15] to see something personal that's right
[39:17] but see to me the new
[39:19] birth then the the coming into the body
[39:23] of Christ the as I said about the
[39:25] children of isra and gave you the the
[39:28] Webster's definition of adoption or
[39:31] adopt see where did everybody be
[39:33] specific adoption is the act or fact of
[39:36] being adopted I mean it's okay Webster
[39:39] but the adopt is
[39:42] to actually you take someone else's
[39:46] child born to someone else and you bring
[39:49] them into your family right and and you
[39:52] adopt them into your family with all
[39:55] legal rights and
[39:57] see than than it is in the bases of no
[40:00] more than it is in any other child
[40:02] because that's the law of the land that
[40:04] you you give that right by the adopt if
[40:07] you adopt somebody's children well then
[40:09] we're talking about
[40:11] Israel see you say well they were the
[40:14] chosen of God but how were they chosen
[40:17] they were a nation a people but they
[40:19] were adopted into the family of God see
[40:24] the process of of bring them forth and
[40:27] made it as I said the choosing is a word
[40:29] for adopt or even the word a spouse
[40:33] right see is the same word as
[40:36] adopt and in doing that then God chose
[40:39] Israel to be his people all right and
[40:43] when he chose them see he didn't give
[40:46] them the new birth back there that was
[40:47] the natural story of bringing in a
[40:51] people to a spiritual condition you know
[40:55] of being the ch chosen of God but they
[40:58] had to be chosen right something took
[41:01] place God adopted Israel into his
[41:05] lineage or line because they were you
[41:08] know it was there but we Gentiles as we
[41:10] read this morning from Ephesians there
[41:13] we were aliens from God we had no
[41:17] nothing because adoption pertains to
[41:19] Israel see because that would be their
[41:22] right their inheritance and we don't
[41:25] have any inheritance
[41:27] leave that way we don't have anything
[41:30] promised to us
[41:31] Gentiles we were just a bunch of dogs
[41:34] just Outcast just garbage you know
[41:36] wouldn't but see then when it came down
[41:40] to the basis that as I said Jesus
[41:43] started his he was identified right all
[41:46] right then he went to amount of
[41:48] transfiguration you know and authority
[41:50] and things and all came in then the
[41:52] change came well we're going to go
[41:54] through that way right right but want
[41:56] you to stay on with me on the basis of
[41:59] of just seeing how did we ever become
[42:01] the children of God right of course now
[42:04] the great message of the hour of people
[42:06] you know oh I always was a Son of God
[42:09] and they'll quote brother Randon well
[42:11] that's fine but keep quoting right see
[42:14] as a believer in the in doing I said
[42:17] this morning I'm a firm believer that we
[42:19] must be born again
[42:21] amen I don't believe we just come in
[42:23] this message you know you just just come
[42:25] along and you believe say I believe the
[42:27] message well the devil did too that make
[42:30] him born again you know all right but
[42:33] see that's you know I I want us to see
[42:36] that we must receive or come to a place
[42:39] because then adoption goes on it doesn't
[42:43] stop just by your new birth that's just
[42:45] the
[42:46] beginning see then it will go on to
[42:49] sunship but you know a child had to be a
[42:53] child you know you had to be first born
[42:55] into the the world or you're not here
[42:57] now that's just you know amen see it's a
[43:00] a child and and we read a lot of the
[43:03] quotes that we you know we didn't become
[43:05] children yeah here that no well all
[43:08] right that's in God's mind right right
[43:10] right but see there has to be a time
[43:12] that you and I must receive the new
[43:14] birth amen amen because if we don't
[43:16] receive the new birth we're not the
[43:18] children of God right we were aliens
[43:21] from God you know we were we were
[43:23] Outcast and and Peter we read said what
[43:25] did is it we come to the basis see to to
[43:29] desire that as newborn
[43:33] babies
[43:35] amen you didn't come into this
[43:38] message you know at full grown that's
[43:41] right you didn't come in to the New
[43:42] Birth that doesn't make you full grown
[43:44] it makes you a baby and we read over
[43:47] there and have used it in in Ephesians
[43:50] that we're we have the earnest of our
[43:52] inheritance that's right until the the
[43:56] Redemption of the purchased possession
[43:58] or or in other words everybody down
[44:01] through there as I said this morning had
[44:02] the new birth you know all born again
[44:05] Believers the new birth they were
[44:07] predestinated to that all right but you
[44:09] and I are predestinated to come to a
[44:11] finished fact or
[44:13] completion of this in our day and
[44:16] understand what's going on well all
[44:18] right let's let's do that and let's
[44:20] believe it amen and not just say well
[44:22] nobody Ain got nothing we just you know
[44:24] everybody just we we've around here we
[44:26] we've been saying the same thing for 40
[44:28] years well that's a reason why right I
[44:31] have it written in my notes but I won't
[44:32] get to it this evening there's a reason
[44:34] why we've been around here 40 years you
[44:37] know what it is is to let all of the
[44:39] ones that wanted to denominate let them
[44:41] go ahead and
[44:42] denominate all right and that's just
[44:46] that's just as simple as can be there's
[44:47] other factors but that's just one point
[44:49] of what I'm talking about but see get
[44:52] the point
[44:53] first Jesus was the son of of God Amen
[44:57] he was born the Son of God he didn't
[45:00] become the Son of God he didn't become
[45:02] God on the River Jordan he was anointed
[45:04] to go forth with his ministry and all
[45:08] right and that was when God identified
[45:10] him as being his son amen right see then
[45:15] that was a a wonderful position because
[45:17] he said in other words I've come down
[45:19] now right that was what God was saying
[45:23] it it as we call it River Jordan
[45:25] experiencing things is baptism I've come
[45:28] down I'm showing you that I've come down
[45:31] I'm going to identify this amen if you
[45:34] get anything you know it's going to come
[45:37] from this one here right all right see
[45:40] then we look at that as adoption to be
[45:42] way on lat later you know over no he was
[45:45] God that's
[45:47] amen see and in his life as I said this
[45:51] morning you you've got the bible to read
[45:55] there's a lot of time time between when
[45:56] he was baptized and the point of where
[45:59] he come to mount of transfiguration that
[46:01] wasn't just sitting back well one he
[46:03] days I come Transfiguration I'll really
[46:04] have something then you know I I I'll
[46:07] become
[46:09] manifested you got to grow up we've got
[46:12] to cover that see he grew in Grace and
[46:15] knowledge the Bible said right but he
[46:17] was God the whole time all right now I
[46:20] believe your new birth brings God into
[46:22] you to make you a child of God right all
[46:26] right and that sets the stage then of
[46:28] adoption to where that eventually we can
[46:31] come to the position of authorities and
[46:34] things like
[46:35] that all right but yet we've got to have
[46:38] the the the the the baby's got to be
[46:41] born you know and that's what I want to
[46:43] hold on today I don't want to even get
[46:45] into and even well there some of the
[46:47] quotes I gave you brother random would
[46:49] be covering you know he said now that's
[46:51] where Pentecost failed and and all this
[46:53] that other think they were born into the
[46:55] family that ended at all but I don't
[46:58] want your mind to even go on to that way
[47:01] of thinking I want your mind on the
[47:04] thinking of the fact that the new
[47:08] birth makes us a child of God Amen all
[47:13] right now that's where he chose us we've
[47:17] read it there in Ephesians that we were
[47:19] chosen in him he chose us he chose to
[47:23] give us the new birth amen right all
[47:25] right in that way then I want us to just
[47:28] think about what he's given us right is
[47:31] I trying to hold it this morning to just
[47:33] the water
[47:35] baptism that identified you to the world
[47:39] that you was a Believer different from
[47:41] others that's right because you took on
[47:44] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ right
[47:48] not to just be baptized and just say
[47:51] well no I went down this way you know up
[47:53] and no it's to be sincere about it and
[47:57] realize realization of what we are and
[47:59] what's taking place right amen and
[48:01] realize this afternoon the one thing I
[48:04] want you to see is the importance of the
[48:07] baptism of the Holy Ghost AM because
[48:10] that's what gives you the new birth amen
[48:14] it's not to believe the message it's not
[48:16] to do all of those are are things that
[48:18] goes with it it's whether or not you're
[48:20] born again that's right amen see that's
[48:23] the point I want to hold in your mind is
[48:26] is do you realize and do you know that
[48:28] you are born again amen that's right see
[48:31] because you can't start the adoption
[48:33] without that part being brought into
[48:35] you there's no need to even talking
[48:38] about it yeah but I want to know these
[48:40] great M I want to the the Mysteries is
[48:43] that the there is a mystery of the new
[48:45] birth right see that is the mystery that
[48:49] God would come down and you ask me how
[48:51] it's done I don't know right that how
[48:54] God would come down and get into my soul
[48:57] and be able to give me a new birth when
[49:00] that thing is black and S as can be and
[49:02] gone into the world and and belonging to
[49:04] the devil right cuz you and I whether we
[49:07] like it or not we're K we was kin folks
[49:09] to the devil right amen we served him
[49:12] amen he was our Master right well know I
[49:16] was a good person all the time yeah you
[49:18] was a good
[49:20] devil that's cuz the devil's good he's
[49:23] not out there in The Honky talks he's
[49:25] not out in the slums you know the the
[49:27] things of the of the garbage can of the
[49:30] drinking and the doing he's not out
[49:32] there right the devil don't want to he
[49:34] wants to be in church he wants to hear
[49:36] about God and talk about him you know
[49:39] because he goes to church more than
[49:41] anybody
[49:42] does I wish y was over here like he
[49:46] is bless at least and and two he lets
[49:50] his presence be known that he's
[49:54] here oh my we can stop there and
[49:57] preaching
[49:58] while he lets his presence be known you
[50:01] know it ain't just he just sits around
[50:03] sleeping and slaming and slumbering and
[50:05] you know just well I'm here you know
[50:07] brother Dale wake me up when
[50:08] everything's going good no but
[50:11] listen see we were born kin folks to the
[50:15] devil that's right absolutely amen I
[50:18] know people don't believe that but I
[50:20] can't help it I believe
[50:23] it and I want you to believe it
[50:27] amen the only difference between me and
[50:30] you and anybody else in the world is one
[50:32] thing God chose
[50:34] us you said well he's over here he chose
[50:37] him for that purpose this group over
[50:40] here he chose him for that purpose
[50:41] that's right but he chose to give us his
[50:43] new birth he chose us to be in the body
[50:46] of Christ he adopted then see that's
[50:50] right so you get your mind all up into
[50:52] adoption and run into state but just
[50:54] remember he he had to bring us into the
[50:59] family the new birth brings us into the
[51:01] family that's why Jesus told Nicodemus
[51:04] said you must be born again right see
[51:08] you got to be born again to be able to
[51:10] see or to enter the kingdom and doing
[51:12] that that new birth then the prophet
[51:14] said is the most important thing in your
[51:18] life right that's right it's the new
[51:21] birth amen all right see then we need to
[51:25] to get that
[51:26] settled right man you know get that
[51:30] finished
[51:31] settled y That's to be where that we can
[51:34] can say we are the children of
[51:37] God and that's like I said I don't know
[51:40] why he chose you and I that's right do
[51:43] you know why God chose you oh I was so
[51:46] wonderful I was so gracious I was no no
[51:49] no no now if you want to stay a while
[51:52] and we preach a while according to the
[51:54] to the prophet in his message and the
[51:57] Bible that the last group coming
[52:01] in was to go out in the highways and
[52:05] hedges and compel them to come in right
[52:10] that's right go out and get the garbage
[52:14] canins right I mean is that the
[52:17] prophet's message is that the Bible well
[52:19] then we shouldn't think of ourselves as
[52:21] being too highly as the scripture says
[52:23] we were to think of ourselves if there's
[52:25] anything good about me it's what God has
[52:28] made
[52:29] me right he chose me I didn't choose
[52:34] him he chose me to be his child he
[52:38] offered me the part all I done was
[52:40] accepted
[52:41] it sure he knew I would do that that's
[52:44] predestination right we know but still
[52:47] he offered it but he offered it to
[52:49] everybody
[52:51] right as the prophet of God I like his
[52:54] way of saying it you know there's not a
[52:55] person in the world and in one way or
[52:57] the other that God hasn't dealt
[52:59] with whether it be your your contact
[53:03] according to your your uh tribe you was
[53:06] living in or whatever you was doing you
[53:08] know right he's contacted people that's
[53:11] right he's G us a choice
[53:14] am and by giving us a choice then all I
[53:17] done is accepted what he's done that's
[53:19] right that that's so hard to believe
[53:21] isn't it I mean if if you told people if
[53:24] you said okay now what I want you to do
[53:26] I want you to make a I want you to pay
[53:29] $10,000 to get salvation well they
[53:32] probably hardly not a person in the
[53:33] world that wouldn't start at least a
[53:35] down pavment on it
[53:37] right but see everybody offers you
[53:40] something like that and you want to try
[53:42] to do it or you go do certain penances
[53:45] you do certain ways or you do certain
[53:47] thought you know you believe certain
[53:49] Creeds you do but it's so simple
[53:53] right amen to just believe that's right
[53:58] that Jesus Christ died in my place
[54:00] that's
[54:02] right that's too simple ain't
[54:06] it it's so simple until it's hard to
[54:09] believe right it's easy to believe a lie
[54:13] yes you know you got the devil to help
[54:15] you that's right but it's hard to
[54:17] believe the
[54:18] truth the truth is that you and I must
[54:21] be born again
[54:23] amen and then by being born again that
[54:27] made us babes you know
[54:31] babies it didn't make us
[54:34] adults that's what it troubled at
[54:36] spiritually speaking see right is you
[54:38] see people that are sitting and have you
[54:40] ever seen somebody that I remember we
[54:42] was in school we had a couple of boys
[54:43] and we was in the fifth grade and and
[54:45] they was ready to you know they was
[54:48] about 17 16 17 years old and they they
[54:50] were wanting an excuse to quit school
[54:52] and I told you about it they got in a
[54:54] fight with a teacher where she You'
[54:55] finally expel them well my Lord if both
[54:57] of them probably shaving by
[55:00] then but they knew everything you know
[55:03] man they've grown up but what are you
[55:05] doing in the first grade if you grown up
[55:07] you
[55:08] know I mean that's that's just the way
[55:11] life is right we want to think we're
[55:13] grown up a kid you get about 12 13 years
[55:16] old man you think Mom and Daddy don't
[55:18] know a thing in the
[55:19] world I mean you think the whole world
[55:22] is messed up but you just you got it all
[55:24] in your brain you're so smart well don't
[55:26] worry about it if you live long enough
[55:29] you'll find out that wasn't
[55:31] right you know you'll find out Mom and
[55:34] Daddy was pretty smart well the thing
[55:36] I'm trying to get us to do just realize
[55:38] they hard to start with and save you a
[55:40] lot of trouble but that's human nature
[55:42] all right but do you see what I'm
[55:44] talking about yes I just want us to
[55:47] think about do you have the new
[55:51] birth all right now if you have the new
[55:54] birth
[55:56] then your adoption has already
[55:58] started right because that new birth
[56:01] brings you into the
[56:05] body that makes you a child of God
[56:10] Amen so the process is already into
[56:13] being right amen and the process of what
[56:15] I'm talking about is the thing that even
[56:17] down through Ages was all if you're
[56:20] listening this morning and been
[56:22] listening the everybody's predestined
[56:25] ated to the new birth and they had the
[56:27] new birth in every age all the way
[56:30] down all right but yet compare what they
[56:34] had with what we have we've come a long
[56:37] ways that's right but it's been God to
[56:40] bring us all of that way that's right
[56:42] all right and see then that new
[56:46] birth that new birth is what we need
[56:49] amen because that makes us a child of
[56:53] God then you can start the stages of
[56:56] adoption then you can start the growth
[56:58] of the development of a child but get
[57:01] the baby here
[57:02] first see but what we want to do is like
[57:06] brother Mo told a man one time he said
[57:08] you know he said what according to your
[57:09] Doctrine said in that time I think was
[57:12] Forest had just been born but anyhow he
[57:15] said what you're saying brother is that
[57:17] said my wife and she was at the hospital
[57:20] in I think with forest and he said what
[57:22] you're saying is it said my wife is just
[57:24] had a baby and said
[57:27] uh where's the baby oh they gone to get
[57:29] him a shaving
[57:31] haircut yeah right I mean cuz it's it's
[57:34] just born
[57:36] grown all of us would want to think that
[57:39] don't
[57:40] we that we're just grown up oh look you
[57:43] know look how we are no right we're just
[57:46] a bunch of babies
[57:48] right and babies are the ones that
[57:50] desire the sincere milk of the word all
[57:53] right now I want you to do this for for
[57:54] me if you
[57:57] will in this series of what we're
[57:59] talking about I wish you would read
[58:02] First Corinthians and 2
[58:05] Corinthians
[58:07] okay I mean that's your your your uh
[58:11] assignment okay and listen to everything
[58:15] you can hear on the hear you hymns the
[58:17] adoptions the position in Christ and and
[58:19] the things like that listen to them over
[58:21] and over and hear what your Prophet is
[58:23] saying all right but the reason I say
[58:27] first and 2 Corinthians because really
[58:30] the Corinthians that's why it's that way
[58:32] it is the Corinthians it is the book of
[58:34] Corrections right all right in other
[58:37] words you see perfectly in the
[58:40] Corinthians a bunch of babies
[58:43] right see AR they were arguing about
[58:46] who's the
[58:48] greatest they were arguing about who was
[58:51] to be the leader you know they were
[58:53] arguing over the gifts to be
[58:56] right all of it was just an argument
[58:59] backward for and Paul constantly trying
[59:02] his best to get the Corinthians to grow
[59:05] up right right see and and to become the
[59:10] children of God but he never had any
[59:12] trouble with Ephesians he didn't have to
[59:14] explain the thing right to the church at
[59:17] Ephesus you know the Ephesians he didn't
[59:19] have to do that at Galatians he could
[59:21] tell them deeper things but to the
[59:23] Corinthians were always arguing about
[59:26] you know who do you follow I'm of apoll
[59:29] I'm a Peter I'm a I'm of in the message
[59:33] right uh but see it just always somebody
[59:37] trying to have some kind of a way right
[59:41] but what I want you to think on with me
[59:43] as I was ring out there at the end this
[59:44] morning see that we're aliens we were
[59:47] aliens away from God come on we had to
[59:50] be born again amen and by being born
[59:53] again that would put us in into the body
[59:55] that's right that would put us like then
[59:58] all of the stories the prophet would be
[1:00:00] telling you that you'll hear him
[1:00:02] explaining that in the Old Testament
[1:00:04] they had a custom of adoption all right
[1:00:07] and that custom of adoption was that
[1:00:10] that a baby was born into the family and
[1:00:13] when it was born into the family now
[1:00:15] there's a lot of the quotes here for the
[1:00:16] people on the internet and they can read
[1:00:18] it but you already to know the message
[1:00:19] if you heard anything at all you already
[1:00:21] to know that that child was born into
[1:00:23] the family right it was a child that's
[1:00:26] right see the father didn't disown the
[1:00:30] child because of the development of the
[1:00:33] child not being as great as the other
[1:00:36] right I mean there not a story there
[1:00:38] that the prophet tells and say well you
[1:00:41] know the the daddy couldn't trust the
[1:00:43] child so he cast him out of his family
[1:00:45] now there's no such thing you find your
[1:00:48] prodical son as an
[1:00:51] example that he wanted his right
[1:00:55] he took it he went out into the world he
[1:00:58] squandered all of it but when he come
[1:01:00] home what did daddy do well bless God
[1:01:02] Son you going to sit down over there
[1:01:04] you're not in my family just get on go
[1:01:06] on you wanted to leave you know
[1:01:09] no he brought him right back into the
[1:01:12] family cuz he knew he had learned a
[1:01:14] lesson he had grown up in that period of
[1:01:17] time that's right right and he got to
[1:01:20] the position that he could adopt you and
[1:01:23] we happen to be in Israel when they do
[1:01:25] it is somewhere around 13 years of age
[1:01:27] it's not always probably the same but we
[1:01:30] were there and we saw them having that
[1:01:33] big old word bar vitv ever how you
[1:01:35] pronounce it you know that where they
[1:01:38] adopt into the family right but that
[1:01:41] child was a child right it was born a
[1:01:44] child
[1:01:46] y it was adopted into its own family in
[1:01:50] that uh story our point is not adopting
[1:01:54] someone else
[1:01:56] right you know the children of someone
[1:01:59] else right is adopting your own children
[1:02:02] into your family or bringing them into a
[1:02:05] position all right we'll get to that as
[1:02:07] we go along but my point is they first
[1:02:10] you've got to find out how you became a
[1:02:13] child of God right
[1:02:16] right all right according to the Bible
[1:02:19] see you must receive the baptism of the
[1:02:22] Holy Ghost to become a child of God
[1:02:24] right according to the prophet's message
[1:02:27] we we you know we've got to receive
[1:02:29] Jesus Christ and that would make us a
[1:02:32] child of God all right but you know
[1:02:35] what's so wonderful about it it made me
[1:02:37] a child
[1:02:39] right God is not going to throw me away
[1:02:42] amen no more than as I said the father
[1:02:46] just because the child never reached to
[1:02:48] the uh adoption stages of its life they
[1:02:52] was still a child you know it it didn't
[1:02:54] set it to the brown table while the
[1:02:57] family set it to White table you
[1:02:59] know I mean it didn't have none of those
[1:03:01] differences in it it was a child right
[1:03:05] and it was treated as a child it just
[1:03:08] never was brought to that position to
[1:03:10] have that ceremony to be taken out and
[1:03:13] recognized or or brought before the
[1:03:16] public you know all right but it was a
[1:03:19] child and and if if we never reach
[1:03:22] anything in in the Statue of a perfect
[1:03:24] man or adoptions or whatever we talk
[1:03:27] about God's not going to throw you
[1:03:32] away that's what I think people are
[1:03:34] thinking about see that that why we
[1:03:36] around here 40 years later look like God
[1:03:39] ain't doing
[1:03:40] nothing as I said this morning I wish to
[1:03:43] heaven we would get that out of our mind
[1:03:45] amen and get to the basis that if you
[1:03:47] brought Peter them over here and put
[1:03:49] them here in this situation they would
[1:03:51] scream and holler bloody murder get me
[1:03:53] back where I was
[1:03:54] cuz I I man I can't stand this
[1:03:58] situation you said oh no well the same
[1:04:01] spirit that done one is done the other
[1:04:03] so I I hope you followed me
[1:04:06] right but you see we're in a different
[1:04:09] hour and time that's ever been upon this
[1:04:11] Earth there has never been and even back
[1:04:14] there somewhere into the 60s where those
[1:04:17] 200,000,000 demons was loosed that
[1:04:21] already had existed all form of demons
[1:04:24] and ways and persecutions and trials and
[1:04:27] and troubles and killings and and and
[1:04:30] then we get 200,000,000 loose on us
[1:04:33] right but us said on the bride right all
[1:04:37] right well you know what they're there
[1:04:42] for boy I tell you what I wish we get
[1:04:44] rid of them they're the very thing that
[1:04:46] you need that's right right
[1:04:50] amen
[1:04:52] right you need to devil that's right to
[1:04:55] stay after you yeah but looks like he
[1:04:58] let up every once in a
[1:05:00] while no the closer you get to God the
[1:05:04] more he's going to Bear Down amen I have
[1:05:07] never taught you a flowy bed of ease I
[1:05:10] have never taught you anything I have
[1:05:11] never said we're going to get better and
[1:05:13] we're going to get better everything oh
[1:05:15] the economy is going to straighten out
[1:05:17] Oh's going to straighten it up up there
[1:05:19] you know and no I don't care who who oh
[1:05:22] is he ain't going straighten this thing
[1:05:25] out I don't care if you put him and
[1:05:27] McCain both in office they couldn't
[1:05:29] straighten it
[1:05:30] out I don't throw off on nobody I thank
[1:05:32] God for where we're at and we're doing
[1:05:34] he's doing as good as anybody probably
[1:05:36] doing a day and hour we're doing let me
[1:05:38] put in a plug that away because there's
[1:05:40] one thing about it your belly is still
[1:05:42] as big as it was when he made the office
[1:05:44] probably even bigger and your bank
[1:05:46] account's probably
[1:05:48] greater to a lot of people you know
[1:05:51] that's right all right but that's I'm
[1:05:53] just being honest
[1:05:54] see that's not going to be that's not
[1:05:57] the point the point is the devil brother
[1:06:00] R said we need
[1:06:03] him to beat on us how does babies grow
[1:06:07] up
[1:06:09] y by
[1:06:12] learning it took me 16 years old before
[1:06:14] I learn to ride a
[1:06:17] bicycle you know why go we didn't have
[1:06:23] one I figured that get you we couldn't
[1:06:26] afford them you had them you
[1:06:28] know but
[1:06:30] see some of us are just playing slow and
[1:06:33] I guess that's what I've been all my
[1:06:34] life but as a child of God see we've got
[1:06:37] to grow up amen all right growth
[1:06:40] development is one thing but I want to
[1:06:41] ask you a simple serious
[1:06:44] question this is the the next message on
[1:06:47] down the road how do you
[1:06:50] grow right right man you know what makes
[1:06:54] a tree
[1:06:56] grow
[1:06:58] wind blowing it rocking it backs and for
[1:07:03] shaking it and beating it bending it
[1:07:06] over persecutions is what we need we're
[1:07:09] not talking about tribulation we're
[1:07:11] talking about persecution that the devil
[1:07:13] will bring upon you if you confess
[1:07:15] you're a child of God why he wants to
[1:07:17] try to break you right you said you was
[1:07:21] a child of God he wants to break you
[1:07:23] prove it
[1:07:24] right he did that with the Lord Jesus
[1:07:26] where is it with the Lord Jesus he went
[1:07:28] through a flowery bed of e once he was
[1:07:30] identified then the devil went right
[1:07:32] after him why took him 40 days and 40
[1:07:35] nights out into the
[1:07:39] Wilderness he went with no water and no
[1:07:41] food you can't do that proved he was God
[1:07:44] if people don't believe that was God
[1:07:45] didn't that right there be enough cuz
[1:07:47] you can't live that long without food
[1:07:48] and
[1:07:49] water but he was almighty God but now
[1:07:53] listen
[1:07:56] we were born
[1:07:58] wrong so we need a new
[1:08:01] birth to make us the children of God
[1:08:04] right and then that brings us into the
[1:08:07] family now then it comes to word that
[1:08:09] God doesn't adopt anybody else's
[1:08:12] children that's right the stages of
[1:08:14] adoption won't apply to the world that's
[1:08:17] right it only applies to those that are
[1:08:20] the children of God Amen that's right
[1:08:24] and here we are coming down through and
[1:08:26] see thinking that we you know that we
[1:08:29] this that the other when we're trying to
[1:08:32] turn down the
[1:08:33] things that God has
[1:08:37] provided to bring us to the right
[1:08:42] place I know it's don't sound right I
[1:08:45] know that's not sounding right to the
[1:08:47] human mind right but how did Israel get
[1:08:50] back into the own land right by the Jews
[1:08:54] 6 million people being killed all over
[1:08:56] the
[1:08:58] country you know what that's what put
[1:09:00] them back in the promised
[1:09:04] land but now if you ask a Jew and he was
[1:09:07] really a true person what would he say I
[1:09:10] caused
[1:09:13] this because I wouldn't
[1:09:15] do what I was supposed to do if they're
[1:09:19] real true
[1:09:20] person huh see you and I are the one
[1:09:23] that brings these things upon
[1:09:27] us then we grip because they happen but
[1:09:30] it's part of our life right see the
[1:09:33] point of wanting you to get though get
[1:09:35] that's over there see you want to go on
[1:09:37] the point is get the new birth
[1:09:41] right well I've had a new birth for 40
[1:09:44] years well then you ain't got no problem
[1:09:46] with me talking about
[1:09:47] it cuz you know I'm
[1:09:50] right
[1:09:51] right you know what I'm saying is right
[1:09:54] if you've got the new birth now if
[1:09:56] you're arguing about it in your mind
[1:09:58] then you don't have it is that enough
[1:10:04] yes yeah but we need this we need that
[1:10:08] how do you get
[1:10:14] it how you going to get it let's start
[1:10:17] off right amen right let's get the new
[1:10:20] birth let's get in the body that's right
[1:10:25] then we can expect a growth development
[1:10:29] that's right if we're in the body
[1:10:33] right because see we must be born again
[1:10:38] right and that's why I gave you a bunch
[1:10:41] of quotes and and I tried to isolate
[1:10:43] them but it's so hard to do with the way
[1:10:45] the prophet says it we must be born to
[1:10:47] be a son right right if we're a Son of
[1:10:50] God it means we're born again right
[1:10:53] we're not talking about the natural
[1:10:55] creation of the whole world as as being
[1:10:57] the the children of God that way the
[1:10:59] sons of God I explained that this
[1:11:01] morning we're talking about the body of
[1:11:04] Jesus Christ amen right we're talking
[1:11:06] about being in the body yes right by the
[1:11:10] new birth making us a child of
[1:11:15] God and and being a child of God then it
[1:11:20] means you're an offspring of God right
[1:11:22] you don't have to wait till the change
[1:11:24] come to become a child of God
[1:11:27] Amen that's where we miss the whole
[1:11:29] thing oh one of these days boy I tell
[1:11:32] you what that prophet he had it one of
[1:11:35] these days we'll have it well that one
[1:11:37] of these days is out in front of you
[1:11:39] come on you like the donkey with the
[1:11:41] carrot you know what I'm saying right
[1:11:44] you know what they done with a donkey
[1:11:46] you know he wouldn't get up and go so
[1:11:47] they put a carrot on the stick stuck it
[1:11:49] out in front of him you know he's trying
[1:11:51] to get the carrot and he pulls a the the
[1:11:52] card along
[1:11:55] we're trying to make something
[1:11:56] manifested when we're the best thing to
[1:11:58] do is just get born again now how did
[1:12:01] you get here
[1:12:03] naturally right how did you get here
[1:12:05] naturally right Mom and Daddy that's
[1:12:10] right you know Mom and Daddy brought a
[1:12:12] little baby in the
[1:12:14] world the thing about this we've been
[1:12:16] around here long enough to I'm just just
[1:12:18] about remember when a lot of you were
[1:12:20] born and I happened to be there in the
[1:12:22] hospital when a lot of them was born you
[1:12:25] know and
[1:12:27] everything I I've been with you I've
[1:12:30] seen you when you a little baby right if
[1:12:32] it let me I just been want it went in
[1:12:34] there way you you know kind of spank you
[1:12:37] a little bit but you know get you start
[1:12:39] life well that's all I've been trying to
[1:12:41] do ever since then you know it just
[1:12:44] spank us enough to get us to think about
[1:12:46] it consider that new birth that you have
[1:12:49] am God has partnershi you with eternal
[1:12:53] life amen that's
[1:12:55] right what a wonderful situation
[1:12:58] am as I said if I never reach any
[1:13:01] position I'm not going to die and go to
[1:13:03] hell
[1:13:05] right right if I'm a if I'm a if I'm a
[1:13:10] not a reverent child I'm not going to be
[1:13:12] Cast
[1:13:15] Away if I'm not a good child that you
[1:13:18] know mind and I'm not going to be Cast
[1:13:20] Away
[1:13:22] right to me that's a wonderful thing
[1:13:25] Amen to think that God gave me eternal
[1:13:27] life
[1:13:28] amen he know me a
[1:13:31] thing I owe him I owe him everything in
[1:13:33] the world he don't owe me
[1:13:37] nothing and it's not something good I
[1:13:40] done that's right I mean how many of you
[1:13:42] people got here by being how many of you
[1:13:44] people got naturally born by being
[1:13:47] good that's kind of
[1:13:50] a problem is
[1:13:52] it
[1:13:54] I mean sister Johnny did you was you
[1:13:56] something that you way back you know no
[1:13:59] no Mom and Dad just brought you here you
[1:14:01] said that's carnal but there's one thing
[1:14:03] about it's getting the point across
[1:14:06] right we didn't have anything to do with
[1:14:08] getting here
[1:14:11] naturally what did we have to do with
[1:14:13] getting here spiritually outside of one
[1:14:15] thing and that was accepting what Jesus
[1:14:18] Christ has
[1:14:21] done it can't be anything else can bring
[1:14:24] it because it salvation would be
[1:14:25] something Happ that's
[1:14:30] right so then we must be born
[1:14:33] again that would make us a child of God
[1:14:37] now once you get to that stage see of d
[1:14:40] That's What I Call stage
[1:14:44] one all right and stage one is to to
[1:14:48] come into the family by the new
[1:14:51] birth then we can call talk about the
[1:14:54] growth developments the the things that
[1:14:56] will transpire you know and that's why I
[1:14:59] tried to isolate if you'll look at your
[1:15:01] quotes and then remember when we get
[1:15:03] back to them later on the other ones
[1:15:05] you'll see brother random spends a lot
[1:15:07] of emphasis upon the basis of where
[1:15:08] we're failing at right but I'm not
[1:15:11] trying to get that point to you I'm
[1:15:12] trying to get to the point that there is
[1:15:15] no failure in the new birth
[1:15:18] that's it's the new birth right it's the
[1:15:22] most wonderful thing that could ever be
[1:15:24] cuz it made us a child of
[1:15:26] God like I said though people in the
[1:15:28] message see they're saying what always
[1:15:30] was a child of
[1:15:32] God see well then you don't need the new
[1:15:36] birth and Jesus Christ died in vain so
[1:15:39] you don't need that but what we need is
[1:15:43] to realize what the New Birth has made
[1:15:47] us you realize that one day you was a
[1:15:50] child of the devil come on K folks to
[1:15:54] the devil come on had one closer Ken and
[1:15:57] we served him right but then God in a
[1:16:01] split second made you a child of his
[1:16:04] right right gave us eternal life
[1:16:09] right right and then us stand as humans
[1:16:14] and say nothing ain't going
[1:16:19] on you know what I'm saying see people
[1:16:22] that's just the way they are we just
[1:16:23] going to church and being good now they
[1:16:25] just have Services every once in a while
[1:16:28] that's right you know I mean they just
[1:16:31] people at the churches they're just
[1:16:32] cutting down on the amount of services
[1:16:33] they have why because they gone out into
[1:16:36] the world with the rest of it you know
[1:16:38] and do it right was out west out there
[1:16:40] and they had a church that they said
[1:16:42] well we don't have evening services and
[1:16:43] I'm not calling names and they no state
[1:16:45] but they said we're not having evening
[1:16:47] Services because we all go hunting in
[1:16:49] the
[1:16:49] evening well in the summertime you went
[1:16:52] to church but in the winter time I
[1:16:53] reckon you went
[1:16:55] hunting you
[1:16:57] know I didn't understand that I wanted
[1:17:00] to ride with a man he said well let no
[1:17:01] need us going I don't have one
[1:17:05] service it was 3 or 4 Hour driver more I
[1:17:08] was going to ride with him go there and
[1:17:09] be in church that Sunday you know CU you
[1:17:12] know I certainly wouldn't go and Hunt
[1:17:15] but my point
[1:17:17] listen the new birth brings you into
[1:17:20] your family just as your natural birth
[1:17:25] brought you into your natural family
[1:17:27] right that's right your natural birth
[1:17:31] made you in the lineage y of your
[1:17:35] Earthly parents Y and made you air of
[1:17:38] all they have right your natural birth
[1:17:43] right all right now we could go out and
[1:17:46] adopt somebody else's children and that
[1:17:49] brings it into the same stages but see
[1:17:51] just use it like a saying the new birth
[1:17:55] then puts us into the family of
[1:17:59] God I know brother Gary he and I used to
[1:18:02] talk a lot about this that when you
[1:18:03] first born again you know Daddy just
[1:18:05] answers every prayer you make don't you
[1:18:08] remember that you remember when you
[1:18:10] first got
[1:18:11] saved you know how that Daddy was just
[1:18:13] there you could ask him for anything he'
[1:18:15] just give it to you why cuz he's a pet
[1:18:18] and a little old
[1:18:20] baby you know it matter if you said to
[1:18:22] you years old he his baby and he's
[1:18:26] giving you
[1:18:28] everything but then he realized hey you
[1:18:31] know I mean you give a kid everything
[1:18:33] it'll wind up sitting there with his
[1:18:37] mouth all it be eating right right no
[1:18:41] you don't want it to stay that way you
[1:18:43] want it to learn Amen to grow right you
[1:18:46] want it to muscles to be used that's
[1:18:48] what God wants in his family that's
[1:18:50] right but the main thing is are we in
[1:18:53] his
[1:18:54] family
[1:18:55] Amen brother I believe the message don't
[1:18:58] go that way that's
[1:19:01] right the devil's got you in the biggest
[1:19:04] trap that's ever been is to try to tell
[1:19:05] the people that they don't need nothing
[1:19:08] that's why I holler so much against it
[1:19:09] because see the people are preaching
[1:19:12] that you don't need all these things
[1:19:14] well then how in the world are the
[1:19:15] children going to be able to receive
[1:19:18] anything children you realize one thing
[1:19:21] that brother Dale he loves you and he
[1:19:22] done everything he could to help you
[1:19:24] right that's right
[1:19:27] right but he's also going to tell you
[1:19:29] you're lost
[1:19:31] right and you must be born again that's
[1:19:35] right you got to be saved you don't go
[1:19:37] to heaven because mom and daddy is going
[1:19:39] to heaven that's right amen you got to
[1:19:42] be born
[1:19:44] again it's not that you just well I was
[1:19:46] born in this family no
[1:19:49] right no you got to be born again if
[1:19:53] you're the age of accountability to
[1:19:54] understand what I'm talking about then
[1:19:57] you're at the age of understanding that
[1:19:59] you must be born again
[1:20:02] amen right to come into the family of
[1:20:05] God Amen but see when God brought you
[1:20:08] and I into the family now here's my
[1:20:10] whole thing I'm trying to get to you he
[1:20:12] adopted us into the family
[1:20:17] right adopted us into the
[1:20:21] family
[1:20:23] cuz that's where he chose
[1:20:24] us see I know that that doesn't agree
[1:20:27] with everybody else's adoptions they
[1:20:29] want the adoption of the statute perfect
[1:20:31] man the growth developments they want
[1:20:32] all that quotes but you don't listen to
[1:20:34] The Prophet talking that you must be
[1:20:36] born again right that you must be you
[1:20:39] must accept Jesus Christ to be in the
[1:20:41] family of God right and if you don't
[1:20:43] accept Jesus Christ then you're not in
[1:20:45] the family that's
[1:20:48] right we got to be brought into the
[1:20:50] family before we can start talking about
[1:20:52] growth of development that's right you
[1:20:55] but see that child as I
[1:20:58] said then that child as I said about the
[1:21:00] book of Corinthians he needs
[1:21:06] correction why because you want him to
[1:21:08] grow up right all right that's growth
[1:21:11] development that's that those those
[1:21:13] things but first to be in the family of
[1:21:15] God you must be born
[1:21:17] again to make you a child of
[1:21:21] God and then by being born again
[1:21:29] see then you become an air right now
[1:21:35] here's the
[1:21:36] adoption the prophet explains and he
[1:21:38] says that a child and the scripture says
[1:21:41] that there there have no
[1:21:43] inheritance what's he
[1:21:46] saying what is brother rown saying when
[1:21:48] he says the child is no different what
[1:21:50] is Paul saying in Galatians
[1:21:54] for that is no different we'll get to
[1:21:56] that scripture in a minute what's he
[1:21:59] saying is he saying that's not a child
[1:22:02] no no sir right you're going wrong now
[1:22:07] it's a
[1:22:09] child and it has a right to sit at the
[1:22:12] table and eat right it has a right of
[1:22:14] all the benefits of the family right it
[1:22:17] just can't be trusted with the
[1:22:18] inheritance the Rich Young Ruler done
[1:22:21] that right right I mean the the prodical
[1:22:23] son not the Richi Young Ruler the
[1:22:25] prodical son he took his ahead of
[1:22:28] time y had he had had he been raised
[1:22:31] right he wouldn't went out and blowed it
[1:22:33] right so then he wouldn't have been my
[1:22:35] child adopted into my family on the
[1:22:38] bases of inheritance so when you read
[1:22:41] the prophet and you hear him say see
[1:22:43] said he's a child said he has no
[1:22:44] inheritance what's he talking
[1:22:48] about he's not talking about that you
[1:22:50] can't sit at the table and eat right
[1:22:52] that's right right I'm just making the
[1:22:54] natural point he's not saying that you
[1:22:57] you're not in the family he's not saying
[1:22:59] the child is not a child that it's a
[1:23:01] disowned child and cast out of the
[1:23:03] family no right God has never done
[1:23:05] nobody that way
[1:23:08] right he's saying they're in there
[1:23:10] they're there they're children right but
[1:23:13] yet the growth development is not there
[1:23:15] that's right right right right he's
[1:23:17] covering growth development not whether
[1:23:19] or not you're a child right the new bird
[1:23:22] make you're a child of God you're born
[1:23:24] into the family of God just as you're
[1:23:27] born into your natural family that's
[1:23:29] right and by the new birth that puts you
[1:23:32] in the family
[1:23:37] right but yet that's not the point that
[1:23:39] you want a child to be
[1:23:43] right you look at your children you see
[1:23:45] pictures of them when they're 2 or 3
[1:23:47] years old and you really the old man
[1:23:49] look at that you know but you don't want
[1:23:51] him to stay that that's right right
[1:23:54] that's
[1:23:55] right why because that's that's not the
[1:23:58] the the whole
[1:24:01] story right you know there's something
[1:24:03] wrong if the child stays that way that's
[1:24:05] right all right but see I gave you a
[1:24:09] whole bunch of quotes where brother
[1:24:10] talking about how you must be born the
[1:24:12] Son of
[1:24:14] God and see that's why you got to
[1:24:16] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:24:18] what is it first Corinthians about 17
[1:24:21] you know where it talks about a a new
[1:24:23] creature that it makes you a new
[1:24:25] creature in Christ Jesus the new birth
[1:24:28] see a new creation why because that's
[1:24:30] what you are you become a child of God
[1:24:33] by the new birth now you have the right
[1:24:36] of
[1:24:38] adoption now are you listening to what
[1:24:40] I'm saying adoption was pertaining to
[1:24:42] Israel had no pertaining to you and I
[1:24:44] yes the new birth adopted us into the
[1:24:51] family of God that's
[1:24:54] right placed
[1:24:56] us chose us put us in the
[1:24:59] family now I've got a right to The
[1:25:03] Inheritance right I've got a right to to
[1:25:07] want to move up and to come to the place
[1:25:10] that that God wants me to be
[1:25:13] right see I've been brought into the
[1:25:16] family the first thing says you got to
[1:25:18] be brought into the family cuz you're
[1:25:21] not into the family just because your
[1:25:22] natural birth right right you're in your
[1:25:26] natural family because of your natural
[1:25:28] birth you must have a spiritual birth to
[1:25:31] be brought into the family of God the
[1:25:33] new
[1:25:35] birth and then when you have the new
[1:25:37] birth see then that puts you into that
[1:25:40] family right see now what happens go to
[1:25:44] Galatians 4 we we'll pick up and just
[1:25:47] get a few
[1:25:49] things and we'll see what Paul had to
[1:25:51] say about it
[1:25:56] cuz once that baby brought into the body
[1:25:58] of
[1:26:00] Christ but it's a
[1:26:03] baby all
[1:26:06] people all people are babies when
[1:26:10] they're first born into the family of
[1:26:12] God amen amen now it starts off with
[1:26:14] full grown we know the whole story the
[1:26:17] disciples were tutored for 3 and 1/2
[1:26:19] years and when the Holy Ghost fell it
[1:26:20] gave them what was known as a Fai the
[1:26:22] father but on Theus I mean on the the
[1:26:25] 3,000 outside at the next time they're
[1:26:27] babies right babies
[1:26:31] right read all of the things in the
[1:26:33] Bible about just babies growing
[1:26:36] up cuz that's what God wants us to be so
[1:26:40] listen to how Paul sums it
[1:26:45] up now I say that the air now he's just
[1:26:48] coming down explaining the there's
[1:26:50] neither Jew nor Greek there's neither
[1:26:52] the bond or free there nether male or
[1:26:53] female and all and he's talking about
[1:26:55] that that we're Abraham's
[1:26:57] seed now we know we're not Abraham's
[1:27:00] natural seed the new birth makes us
[1:27:02] Abraham spiritual seed right right it is
[1:27:05] not a Jew that's a Jew outwardly but a
[1:27:07] Jew that's a Jew inwardly all now I say
[1:27:10] that the heir as long as he is a child
[1:27:13] differ nothing from a servant right
[1:27:15] though he be Lord of
[1:27:20] all the baby
[1:27:24] you don't trust it with driving the car
[1:27:27] right you don't trust it with the doing
[1:27:30] but you let it learn that's right amen
[1:27:33] and let them do that's what they always
[1:27:35] get with me because you know they say
[1:27:37] I'm just a do to your granddaddy with
[1:27:38] the grandkids cuz I've sat and you know
[1:27:41] we'd be working at home and and it'd
[1:27:43] take me an hour to do what I could done
[1:27:45] in 5 minutes you know
[1:27:47] why I was letting the grand kids help me
[1:27:50] or the kids you know CU it's training
[1:27:52] them you know and let them pound nails
[1:27:55] there some in our living room floor
[1:27:57] there probably a Geer counter would
[1:27:58] really go off right in the middle cuz
[1:28:00] there's probably 100 Nails drove in one
[1:28:02] Circ from this big well I didn't go tear
[1:28:05] them all out and do everything I just
[1:28:07] covered it over another sler you know
[1:28:10] but let them train and you know they
[1:28:13] learn right in the garden the other day
[1:28:15] you know and I was trying to plant some
[1:28:17] stuff and and if if it's really good I
[1:28:19] love to do it and I'll just drop my seed
[1:28:22] and you know instead of taking the hole
[1:28:24] and cover them up I just walk and push
[1:28:26] the dirt like that each way you know and
[1:28:28] some of you older ones know what I mean
[1:28:30] and you just cover it up well it pack
[1:28:32] and you walking on it and it kind of
[1:28:33] packs that wet soil down just like the
[1:28:36] planter does on the regular planter why
[1:28:38] you stuff comes up so good all right but
[1:28:41] you know as I start doing that in little
[1:28:43] Abby you know four years old in a few
[1:28:46] days and you know she want to help me I
[1:28:49] want I want to plant some well I give
[1:28:52] her some seed I used to do it with a
[1:28:54] kids I used to do it with a grandkid I
[1:28:56] have corn growing in the middle of the
[1:28:58] road amen beans right out in the
[1:29:02] middle right where the okra is at beans
[1:29:04] is growing up why I let him put
[1:29:08] them H well then she saw me doing that
[1:29:11] covering up and Nanny and list and then
[1:29:13] just D laughing at her cuz why cuz here
[1:29:15] I was dropping the stuff and she was
[1:29:17] coming along behind kicking
[1:29:19] dirt she learning
[1:29:23] he well a lot of people you can tell go
[1:29:25] out there and a lot of kids is 10 years
[1:29:27] old or 15 go out there and cover up that
[1:29:29] see cover up what do you
[1:29:32] do how you cover it up well let them
[1:29:37] learn they call me patience of Job when
[1:29:40] it comes to that cuz I do I love to I
[1:29:42] love to let the kids say look this is
[1:29:43] the way you do it you know this is I
[1:29:46] want to train
[1:29:47] them you know where they can they learn
[1:29:50] to do something right that's part of the
[1:29:52] family but see they're they're they're
[1:29:54] under what verse
[1:29:57] two but it's under tutors and governors
[1:30:01] until the time appointed of the father
[1:30:04] even so we when we were
[1:30:07] children listen were in bondage under
[1:30:10] the elements of the world that's right
[1:30:13] all right now he's explaining a two-fold
[1:30:15] thing right first off the natural when
[1:30:18] you're under the bondage of the elements
[1:30:20] you're a child working in life you don't
[1:30:22] all right
[1:30:24] secondly if we're a child we're still
[1:30:26] under
[1:30:29] bondage a child is under
[1:30:32] bondage it's dependent upon somebody to
[1:30:35] raise it right to help it see all right
[1:30:38] but when the fullness of time was come
[1:30:40] God sent forth his son made one made
[1:30:42] under to redeem them under the law that
[1:30:44] we might receive the adoption of
[1:30:47] sons all
[1:30:49] right now
[1:30:53] he he's no different he's an air but
[1:30:55] he's given a tutor and I gave you a
[1:30:57] bunch of quotes where brother brandham
[1:30:58] and just handpicked a few of them where
[1:31:00] he tells you what the tutor really is
[1:31:03] for a
[1:31:05] Christian right newborn baby in Christ

[1:31:25] Leader well why wouldn't we want to
[1:31:27] follow in the footsteps now see
[1:31:29] everybody wants to get on over into the
[1:31:31] other but you know well the the tutor
[1:31:34] has to go before and explain to the
[1:31:36] father a lot of times that we're not
[1:31:37] living right that's the next message all
[1:31:39] right stay in this message you know
[1:31:42] where I'm at today and think about it
[1:31:45] God gave us a
[1:31:48] tutor you know a razor
[1:31:53] the Holy
[1:31:54] Spirit
[1:31:57] right what could be greater than to
[1:32:00] think about that my father thought so
[1:32:03] much about me now listen that he didn't
[1:32:05] give me an
[1:32:07] angel we know there's angels and we know
[1:32:10] what they're for they're The Heirs of
[1:32:12] Salvation I know that I preached on it
[1:32:14] we know what it is but get the story
[1:32:16] right
[1:32:17] here he didn't pick out an angel and
[1:32:19] send it down to gu me to be my
[1:32:24] tutor
[1:32:26] right the holy spirit is my tutor amen
[1:32:29] that's right come on now you study the
[1:32:30] message and see what I'm talking
[1:32:32] about you said well an angel you preach
[1:32:34] this a right I preach as angels and I
[1:32:36] believe in it they for the ARs of
[1:32:38] Salvation right and every Born Again
[1:32:40] believer has an angel right we believe
[1:32:42] that right but this is what I'm trying
[1:32:44] to get you to see something more
[1:32:45] personal an angel is an outside outward
[1:32:50] uh uh
[1:32:52] being assigned to help you right but the
[1:32:56] Holy Ghost is an inside
[1:32:58] teacher right the holy I want the tutor
[1:33:02] inside see that way I don't have to
[1:33:05] worry about it then it's not you trying
[1:33:06] to tell the child what to do and the
[1:33:08] child's off in a world not even
[1:33:10] listening to
[1:33:13] you right it's the inside teacher that's
[1:33:17] right the holy spirit is the tutor the
[1:33:21] new birth
[1:33:22] brings you the tutor that's
[1:33:24] right right puts that holy spirit inside
[1:33:28] of
[1:33:31] you puts God's Own nature God's own life
[1:33:34] inside of you right right to raise you
[1:33:38] amen that's wonderful amen I mean
[1:33:41] whether do you think about it like I do
[1:33:43] or not that's a wonderful thing cuz if
[1:33:45] you could choose the best you could get
[1:33:46] in the world to raise your
[1:33:50] children h
[1:33:53] yes but see we want somebody as we'll
[1:33:56] get to it later we want somebody to tell
[1:33:58] it the
[1:34:00] truth you know the tutor's going to tell
[1:34:02] the truth
[1:34:04] right we don't want somebody to uh take
[1:34:08] it back to the father and try to butter
[1:34:10] it
[1:34:10] up I ain't going to help you grow right
[1:34:14] but see your tutor I gave you some
[1:34:16] quotes where the Prophet said the holy
[1:34:17] spirit is your
[1:34:20] tutor that's a inside
[1:34:24] teacher not an angel to be out here to
[1:34:28] protect you and guide you which is
[1:34:32] wonderful but it's an inside teacher
[1:34:34] that's right an inside
[1:34:37] tutor that's what the new birth means
[1:34:39] amen that's
[1:34:41] right it's not now listen it's not you
[1:34:43] get the new birth and then he gives you
[1:34:45] a tutor that's right all right don't go
[1:34:47] that way when he gave you the new birth
[1:34:50] that is the tutor to raise you
[1:34:54] amen he made it an inside one it's not
[1:34:56] that we got to be wait so long and then
[1:34:58] we'll get the Holy Ghost no no repent
[1:35:01] everyone of be baptized in the name of
[1:35:03] Jesus Christ for remission of sins and
[1:35:04] you shall receive the gift of the Holy
[1:35:06] Ghost amen which is a promise unto you
[1:35:09] and unto your
[1:35:13] children it's a promise
[1:35:16] amen but it's not do you understand what
[1:35:19] I'm saying I know I'm just making
[1:35:21] natural points I'm wanting to it's not
[1:35:24] that you would an angel is wonderful but
[1:35:26] that's an
[1:35:28] outside person or whatever you want to
[1:35:30] call it being to help you but the Holy
[1:35:32] Ghost is not an outside one he's
[1:35:38] inside to raise that child now wouldn't
[1:35:41] it be
[1:35:42] something what if you when you're
[1:35:45] children were born what if you could
[1:35:48] just stand there and the life come in
[1:35:49] them and you could just some way take
[1:35:51] your nature
[1:35:56] this you getting
[1:35:59] it wouldn't it be something to where you
[1:36:02] your baby was going to be born and you
[1:36:03] could just stand right there and you
[1:36:05] could say now this is what I want and to
[1:36:08] make sure of what I want I'm just going
[1:36:10] to come down and go in that child right
[1:36:13] I'm going to give that child part of my
[1:36:15] life that'd be great would it you see we
[1:36:18] can't do
[1:36:19] it doesn't work out
[1:36:22] way but God can that's right amen the
[1:36:26] new birth he just comes right down
[1:36:28] places his own life right the tutor is
[1:36:31] not a secondary person that's
[1:36:34] right he's not somebody hired to do the
[1:36:38] job he's not going to get paid whether
[1:36:40] he's good or bad you know he's not going
[1:36:42] to get paid better if he's good you know
[1:36:44] or whatever no right and what do they
[1:36:47] say in school if you're giv a
[1:36:49] tutor if the the teachers really know
[1:36:52] the tutor you have they know that
[1:36:55] according to that tutor that they can
[1:36:57] tell who the tutor of that person is
[1:37:01] right because they'll know the nature of
[1:37:04] the person and the way they answer
[1:37:06] questions and way they do the work and
[1:37:07] thing they can tell you this so and so
[1:37:10] was the tutor of that person that
[1:37:12] student because they're seeing their
[1:37:14] nature intill into the natural part of
[1:37:17] it but see the holy spirit is the nature
[1:37:19] of almighty God
[1:37:22] amen right he didn't trust it with
[1:37:24] nobody else that's
[1:37:26] right he come himself to make sure we
[1:37:29] have the right nature that's
[1:37:31] right he come to live in
[1:37:34] us
[1:37:37] hallelujah then whose nature are we
[1:37:39] supposed to display right
[1:37:42] amen and oh come on we still have our
[1:37:45] own human parts about us right just
[1:37:49] because you're born again doesn't get
[1:37:50] rid of everything that's that's why
[1:37:51] you're baby that's right that's right
[1:37:53] that's why the growth development has to
[1:37:55] be there that's
[1:37:58] right I mean you you say but but my
[1:38:01] child wouldn't do that cuz they're born
[1:38:03] again
[1:38:05] M well why do we do
[1:38:09] it we're supposed to be born again
[1:38:12] that's true you know why cuz we're still
[1:38:14] that much
[1:38:16] human that's why brother Dale's always
[1:38:18] been that way I've never preached some
[1:38:20] kind of
[1:38:21] Deliverance that would just and just
[1:38:24] some rabbit in hat trick to BU you just
[1:38:26] one day you're as mean as the devil and
[1:38:28] the next day you're just a saint and
[1:38:30] you'll never do nothing
[1:38:32] wrong now I don't believe in that
[1:38:37] right I wish it was right but don't
[1:38:40] believe in it you know why I don't
[1:38:41] believe in it cuz I lived it I'm still
[1:38:44] living it you know that's why I
[1:38:47] understand it that's why I understand
[1:38:49] why people are like we are is because
[1:38:51] I'm still living
[1:38:54] right that don't make it right or wrong
[1:38:57] that don't justify nothing we were
[1:38:59] trying our best last night to Define
[1:39:02] what would be a lie or not a
[1:39:05] lie you know and I mean that's hard to
[1:39:09] do you say A Lie Is A
[1:39:12] Lie
[1:39:14] well brother
[1:39:16] brand it's not a lie unless you're
[1:39:18] trying to hurt somebody with it
[1:39:21] or some motive or objective you know of
[1:39:23] what you're
[1:39:25] doing well you're saying that the
[1:39:27] prophet said it's all right to lie he
[1:39:28] didn't say it was all right to
[1:39:31] lie he didn't say that right he just
[1:39:35] telling you what it
[1:39:38] was and we were just like someone give
[1:39:41] an illustration like Aaron was like
[1:39:42] saying you know somebody would ask you
[1:39:44] something you know and you say well I've
[1:39:49] been sworn to not say nothing
[1:39:54] will you
[1:39:55] alive
[1:39:57] no my SAR of my oath to keep that a
[1:40:01] secret forbids me to run my big
[1:40:09] mouth see then you say well is it all
[1:40:11] right to lie no it's not all right to
[1:40:13] lie cuz you're trying to deceive with it
[1:40:16] right you know the difference that's
[1:40:18] right right right
[1:40:22] but it's not a lie unless it's really
[1:40:23] trying to hurt
[1:40:26] somebody but random said what that
[1:40:29] little boy said you was up on that
[1:40:31] mountain he said no I
[1:40:35] wasn't he said I wanted to see what
[1:40:37] they'd
[1:40:40] say this Prophet had the right
[1:40:43] answer we just have to search a lot of
[1:40:45] times we find it right then understand
[1:40:49] it right but now listen get the point
[1:40:52] real
[1:40:53] quick God gave us the
[1:40:56] tutor his own
[1:41:00] life now what kind of children are we
[1:41:02] supposed to be
[1:41:06] right when God thought so much of us he
[1:41:08] gave us his own
[1:41:11] life to bring us into his family so that
[1:41:14] he could start the process that would
[1:41:17] carry us into the authorities the
[1:41:19] adoption the change of the body
[1:41:22] that he started it off now get one more
[1:41:24] scripture go to Romans and we'll you'll
[1:41:26] see where we're going go to Romans
[1:41:29] 8 and then you'll see which way we're
[1:41:31] going you know I just forgot my notes
[1:41:33] might as
[1:41:35] well in Romans 8 if you read Romans 8
[1:41:39] verse 14 through about
[1:41:43] 23 you'll find the three stages of
[1:41:46] adoption just like we've been talking
[1:41:47] about CU most of you have been around
[1:41:49] here long enough you heard me Teach over
[1:41:51] this in many many many many years but
[1:41:53] look at where it starts off verse 14 for
[1:41:55] as many as are led by the spirit of God
[1:41:57] they are the sons of
[1:42:00] God if you have the new birth the tutor
[1:42:03] you're a child of God all right what
[1:42:06] does that make you for you have not
[1:42:08] received the spirit of bondage again to
[1:42:11] fear that's right but you have received
[1:42:14] the spirit of adoption whereby we cry
[1:42:18] out our father then he goes on to
[1:42:21] explain the spirit beareth witness with
[1:42:23] our spirit all right see when you're
[1:42:26] born
[1:42:27] again you get the spirit of
[1:42:31] adoption the where you can start the
[1:42:33] process of adoption the holy spirit is
[1:42:36] the spirit of
[1:42:37] adoption right the tutor the
[1:42:42] razor is the same now listen with this
[1:42:45] will be valuable for about four Services
[1:42:47] down but the same holy spirit that is
[1:42:50] your tutor is the one that will position
[1:42:53] you in the
[1:42:54] body right sure right right why I said
[1:43:00] the tutor being in the Holy Spirit is
[1:43:01] very important because it's not that the
[1:43:03] tutor brings you up so far and then you
[1:43:05] turns you over to somebody else the
[1:43:07] tutor is the spirit of the
[1:43:11] father
[1:43:13] right and what is the adoption the
[1:43:16] spirit of the
[1:43:17] father doesn't change right it's the
[1:43:21] same holy spirit it's just according to
[1:43:23] what he's working on he has to come into
[1:43:25] you and I making us the children of God
[1:43:28] and we receive the spirit of
[1:43:31] adoption which is the holy
[1:43:37] spirit then the tutor becomes the razor
[1:43:41] the razor becomes the father right so
[1:43:45] you know what he's growing
[1:43:48] too he's enjoying this too oh yeah
[1:43:51] you know God is bringing out his
[1:43:56] manifestations right right it's going to
[1:43:58] bring his life into view just like it's
[1:44:01] going to bring
[1:44:02] ours the tutor the razor all right the
[1:44:06] holy spirit is your
[1:44:08] tutor but now listen to make sure you
[1:44:12] understand the tutor then doesn't adopt
[1:44:18] you it's the spirit of adoption that's
[1:44:21] right but the tutor becomes the
[1:44:25] Father the father's the one to
[1:44:28] adopt right I hope you kept what I'm
[1:44:31] saying there it won't be confusing to
[1:44:33] you
[1:44:35] see the holy spirit is your
[1:44:38] tutor but it also becomes your father am
[1:44:42] amen that way then it's all one as I
[1:44:46] said to start with this morning it's all
[1:44:49] three stages but it's is it really three
[1:44:52] stages or is it just a growth
[1:44:55] development you know you're the same
[1:44:57] child as you would Brother Anderson when
[1:44:59] your mama rocks you in the
[1:45:02] Cradle you just screwed
[1:45:07] up same
[1:45:11] child cuz he's our father let's stand
[1:45:13] here come on thank on these things but
[1:45:16] my point is what we must get the new
[1:45:20] birth to be able to say we are the
[1:45:22] children of God that's right or
[1:45:25] Nicodemus would have been told all you
[1:45:27] got to do is go back and confess what
[1:45:29] you got and believe what you had
[1:45:32] no he said you must be born again
[1:45:36] right you must die to yourself and
[1:45:39] receive my life was that what he was
[1:45:42] just
[1:45:43] saying if you receive my
[1:45:46] life then you're my child
[1:45:51] I know that's simple I know this morning
[1:45:53] was simple but I'm trying to get us to
[1:45:57] see that something is going
[1:46:01] on and has been going
[1:46:03] on for a long
[1:46:06] time not waiting to something to take
[1:46:09] place waiting on the finished product to
[1:46:13] reach the
[1:46:15] end sure W the body
[1:46:18] change but see your third stage of
[1:46:21] adoption now listen I'm making
[1:46:22] statements ahead your third stage of
[1:46:24] adoption is not the body change
[1:46:27] right that's not scriptural
[1:46:32] right it's too wit right to understand
[1:46:36] the Redemption of the body
[1:46:39] amen is your adoption that's right to
[1:46:42] come to an
[1:46:45] understanding that we've already been
[1:46:49] changed
[1:46:51] and we're still standing here as human
[1:46:54] Mortals there's your
[1:46:57] adoption there's the things that we have
[1:46:59] need of what do we
[1:47:01] got that's TR 167 in the red book we
[1:47:05] ain't done this long
[1:47:09] time when Pains of death
