of the kids now don't uh you kids don't be leaving trash out the playground you know and one of the kids is when it told me about it so you know you just uh don't be leaving your trash in the playground and bring it back in and all like that because that's uh you want to keep the place cleaned up and everything i think the ones that'll try to do it okay i think that's all the announcements uh wedding this coming saturday what time six o'clock okay remember that yeah i think that's all of it father we thank you lord for this day and your love unto us we thank you for calvary thank you for grace thank you lord that you are who you are and that you're trying to reveal yourself unto us and we pray that you would just help us to understand and to walk therein follower to follow thy word is our desire the just open that up unto us because you said if we hunger and thirst after righteousness we shall be filled so we believe that we do that lord and we pray that you'd bless them god have your way remember the sick among us and just touch each one remember those that are not here bless each one brother dean they're preaching for his brother just bless each one and just have your way in our hearts and lives keep us now in jesus name amen revelations 1 the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him to show into his servants things which must surely come to pass and he sent and signified by his angel unto his servant john who by a record of the word of god and of the testimony of jesus christ of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand now we're going over to revelation 6. i'm going to read verse 5 and 6. and when he opened the third seal i heard the third beast say come and see and i'll be held and low a black horse and he that said on him had a pair of balances in his hand and i heard a voice in the midst of the four bc a measure of wheat for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine you may be exceeding the lord that is blessing to the reading of the word now we'll try to review a little bit back where we were this morning and and you know go from there with the message because i want you to get this part i believe it was you know part of the service this morning to do and i want you to get the point in order to see that and it's very vital to me because i told you that was one of the things that the lord showed me this time on the opening of the seals that the prophet knew the writer and who he was when that opened unto him and he saw the antichrist right all right once that was made known that that was satan in the form of the antichrist then he wouldn't have to be dealing with each age because it doesn't deal with a red writer a white rider or a black writer or a pale rider the horse is what the color is right and the horse is the symbolics of the church the power the things that are taking place you know here up on earth and but the writer himself is the devil right and we'll see when we get down to the fourth seal that he becomes satan incarnate and that makes it come back to the beast again for the life but i want you to to think on these things and i want you to think about the that said the writer this morning he gets off the white horse he gets on the red one well that doesn't stop the white horse that deceptive point just keeps right on going right there falls out to the end right but when he gets off the red horse and gets onto the to the black one it doesn't stop the horse you know the actions the ways that that we're talking about the symbols that we're looking at what these mean it doesn't stop that that just continues right on but it's just a writer getting off getting on to the next getting on to the next and then when it comes down to the beast now what's the point and you'll see that he doesn't get off of the beast and watch he doesn't get off of the beast and get on another colored horse right because the pale is the nice one you know in other words when it comes down to the beast part it won't be getting off of that horse the pale one to go on to another horse it comes to an end and brother run says see there you can see that by this the antichrist is revealed in his ride and you know his end is revealed and it's revealed because of the uh combat beast and what they're doing right but i wish you would read those things in there because we're going to get back to this on the fifth seal and and pick it up but i wish you'd read the things that he talks about these combat beasts how that they uh are the line the ox the man the eagle and you know and what we're seeing here that's the question i want to go about it what we're seeing here is we're seeing what's happening in heaven all right because that's where this scene is first at right but then it's got to come to earth right yes amen all right see then it'll show what's happening on earth this writer was writing on earth right but when you see it here it's more or less into a a writing of the book lord john's writing down so he's writing down he doesn't right now we're going back to earth you know he doesn't say things like that it it was you just go right straight on across and he sees all of it while he's in the uh atmosphere of the holy spirit to reveal it to him all right then when he does come down he realizes it's going to happen here right here so these things that we see are happening here remember the lord doesn't show john what it was and if you and i are in the bride of christ then we can see where we're at because these four beasts line the ox the man and the eagle are also the same four beasts you know now not the theorems you know that that's the theorems is the untanglable but the i believe zoom all right they are the ones we saw in chapter five in heaven you know and we kind of left it and went come on back down and started on the others and didn't spend a lot about these combat beasts but i wish you would notice one particular thing i don't think i brought it today i'm sure i didn't i brought around when we get down to the part of it calling death i know it's on the fourth one he said see there you didn't see that under the line you didn't see it under the box in other words the man it's got to be the eagle so that's going to bring it down is what i was trying to say this morning let's get this thing down personal to where we're at you know and the person made a good point to me about it because it was good see the line the opposite man the eagle we see him up here in the opening and thing but then down on earth we see what is taking place and you know it's not just that the first one was a line because there's not a name attached to that one but it says come and see right the second see it says the combat b should come and see and the third open says come and see well then the fourth when it opens it's an eagle we can connect with that because that's our day and our time all right but what i want you to look at for a second and keep this in mind that you know that those combat beats were in the people right right here amen see now we are after the prophet came and brought the message see i'm going to get back to everything i'm not going to spend much time on that point see you and i are now to say and come and see are you listening now i'm saying come and see what's under the seal see you go out you talk to the people and you say well look at this and look at that look at this see it's the combat beast in you right right let's say and come and see you know but it's still riding in you because it's riding in come back against him and we'll get into the fifth seal you know to pick that up more but i wanted you to think on that point until then to where we can look at it all right you see don't think that satan is ever he's always trying to pervert god's word that's his tactic that's his ways of doing he's trying to pervert the word but if he can get in our minds that there's something wrong with the word and he can make you and i doubt our sword the word right he's got us defeated right he doesn't have to do anything else he's got us defeated because we're doubting the word that's why i spend so much of my time and you know that i've done it for 40 something years taking the things that seemingly contrary annual 70 weeks seals and things and and bringing them down to to try to help you and i to where satan can't say look at that he missed it right here see it's wrong here but if he can get you to think for me to think one time that's right all right bible right if we can make us doubt one word of this he's got us defeated keep that in your mind you say well we don't understand all this i didn't say that right not having understanding is one thing but when we come to the place that we doubt the word that's right right that's why it was so hard back there years ago on the dates and the times and the seasons and i'm so hard now against the preachers of this message that are destroying the message that's right well if they can destroy the message and we know brother brown was a human and made mistakes made slips with the tongue yeah that's no problem because he'll be human right but see if satan can make you doubt this message he's got you defeated right right now i'm going to say it and you can think what you want to that's why most of the people are going to go by the graves is because not all age there's a lot of people 1900 years old now not that it's because of letting satan pervert that word with just a little bitty antichrist saying all right and you know yourself that the basics of what after brother random priest about the so many times explained the water baptism and you didn't get into the seals and listen but what about matthew 28 19 yeah well you know what that means and brother reynolds so gracious to answer that you know why because that meant that person right there was deceived upon that point right but they wouldn't have asked the question right amen you understand i mean that's why questions are good right right because it lets us know we're ready all right and i love questions okay so let's get on to something i ended up by the life statement making it of what effect does it have on you to hear of these things that we've been talking about what effect does it have what are your thoughts well brother dale you mean everybody's lost never talked to that never said it you know well do you believe that lula's only what's going never taught that that's right never said that right what effect does it have now of course we think of our families we think of the loved ones right and things that don't believe like we believe right i'm sure we're human we're concerned of people friends and loved ones that you know that don't believe like you do you know yourself that if it would be good even sometimes if some of those people would just outlandishly you know ball you out as we'd call it you'd get over it quicker but they'll let us they said well i don't understand and that affects us it does me right but let's don't let it affect us so much that it makes us doubt the word we're human right i love everybody i want to see everybody say right what you see the word is what's right right that's right and we read enough there throughout the things talking to the antichrist we wrote around said see there anything contrary to the word that's right he's antichrist it's against christ which is the word and see if he can destroy our thoughts he has us defeated amen and we will go by the grave but somebody's not going to be arrogant and hateful bless god i'm i'm going to know what i am but that ain't even in the race okay is that plain enough that person ain't even in the race right that person needs salvation that's as plain as i can be well that's not the point that we think we're something great because remember the bible says whatever you are god made you right amen that's right that's right so then why don't we accept what he's done see because that's what you call mixed emotions out of one side of you you love people and want to see them saved but out of the other side of you you see that that they either won't or can't right receive what you have but does that make you want to lay down what you've got or does it make you want to go home because if you go home say remember somebody can't follow you but if you quit yourself they can't right i'm just trying to be honest and sincere in our hearts because it's very discouraging sometimes to hear that the things that go on around this message and it just makes you to where you want to just pull away and not have anything to do with people that's right but yet you realize that hey you got it somewhere right from somebody right and what if you're the only hoax they have yes sir now when we get down in a minute to this dark age i want you to remember one thing sure it was a very dark time horrible almost seemingly um total destruction but remember there was a little bride yeah bad that's right that's right a little ride there we'll get to that many where he said don't you hurt the northern lights he said if you cake them right around said even if you take them said don't you make them try to say any hail mary's he said kill them that's what he's saying we're ready he said kill him see that's god talking right that's right that's god speaking inside of it don't you you kill them but don't you make them don't try to make them doubt see because that's that little light always shined satan can't put that lord out matter how dark the ages got you remember it was so dark in egypt and it says that it could be felt something like that you know but you know it was light and goshen right there's lightning no matter how bad it gets like polycarp or something being burned to the state you know but yet in the last bit his soul was seen leaving in the form of a dove there's always been light so don't get disheartened about the darkness but i want you to think about the darkness of how dark it is and remember that darkness is here now honestly just just just let me talk to you you just you think about now when you like to see your family your friends but yet they can't see it that's right but remember one thing there are only hopes of ever seeing it lies in you what i was meaning there a moment ago and that combat beast here now in the bride is saying what come and see come and see we're the only hopes the world has amen you see us not always christ in us anyway that's right so think about that now as we continue on with the talk but i just wanted i wrote that down and what effect does it have on you to hear how horrible of a situation has existed in time see we we don't think about it we don't think about being well we're we're was raised in america we're irregardless of what we think about it still we have a freedom right now you know i mean we have a freedom that we can do and say and go and whatever what if you lived in countries where everything has told you i know brother reed doesn't mind me saying it but those people that took over that aluminum box out plant just to get a little bitty something so he would just you know when they needed a small item he would just and okay send somebody go get it you know you know keep shutting the platform we had authority just go get the stuff whatever it needed call in somebody get it fixed or something they said those people were so bound now this is this has been the working force so you can see how much it would be in the religious he said you tell us that we need this right here we need this park cost 50 or something why can you get along without it what would it mean if you don't buy it that's the way they talk i said we can't give you the okay to get it call back all the way over to the country that come from and have to go up the chain of command to finally get somebody that would say somebody we never existed like that right right we never existed in a religious situation that you couldn't believe the way you want to believe you know at least in our night time we've always been free to be able to kind of move and do it in the religious world we can talk about the pope but what if he was in some of those countries that if you spoke one word it was instant death and with no court of appeal see church we we can't comprehend what it would be like to be in such a darkness that's right of cain and his doings we just can't do it we we're not made that way we didn't would raise anyway and then we look at people instead of saying well look they're they're going to kill us one day well the bible said that they would kill you thinking they're doing god's service jesus spoke right what would be the horrible part of thinking about it then but now listen just remember that antichrist spirit is still riding that's right that red horse is still riding maybe here in america it is controlled by the governmental forces i've said a couple of times you know that you don't just go out and start shooting people they'll arrest you but just think of the darkness that's in this land i stood there at you likely years ago and you just you don't have to see i can see people's eyes that's what i do i mean i'm scanning looking at you in your eyes i can tell by your eyes what not what you're thinking but sometimes i can tell what you're thinking when you start going you know i pretty well know what you're thinking but i was looking at some people or a man standing on a street corner i said brother brady because that man don't have no hopes nope then he'd say well why don't you just get a ticket and come to america i said honey how are you gonna get the money you know that they would crawl up in those box at aluminum i thought they knew it was coming to i believe in saint louis or somewhere louisiana somewhere it was coming in and they would try to get enough food together and go in there and a lot of them died in the belly of those ships trying to make it to america and i did i said i said that man's a house look at him so you got a sparkle in your eye because you see jesus christ i said he's a religious person you know more now man he goes to church sometimes but in regardless he has no no hopes in his eyes he just see old luck and he'll be that away the rest of his life we've never been that way so it's hard to to think about it right but let's think on that a little bit trying to make these seals come down to where we're at where we can understand all right but we ended up we i think we might have read anyhow we want to worry about it the brother spoke of these things happening he said there'd be wars and rumors of wars and then he comes on over we picked up about the fifth we will jump on over to the number six brother bob number five right around said it the way he got his power the way satan got his power is that he connected all right council was held in the elected head bishop by doing this they united church and state together that's the only way he could do it was to get the governmental power of the state behind the action of the church you've all heard the story that the jews came to uh kennedy the old man kennedy he was a young ambassador yeah joseph and they asked for help and he liked him you've heard the story that the jew turned and said you and your family's cursed well whether it happened or not i don't know i do know by history that they did ask for help and that we wouldn't help them you know in the beginning because that was just that was the way it went but just like what if you had no hopes right you know in reality if you're lost today you have no hope if you don't have the baptism of the holy ghost there's no light in your soul it's as black as can be because there's no way to get any light there my brother around him would say he said you need the baptisms with the holy ghost more than anything in the world right amen amen you see that's the only light that there is in this dark age would be the light of the holy ghost dwelling so you didn't think about it in the time of darkness you and i have a opportunity to live in goshen but if we don't take that opportunity what do we do right we'll turn it down and we'll go into darkness there's no hope all right let's get over and start on this third seal and let's re-read it again i will pull it up number six and look what he says and when it opened the third seal i heard the third beast said hey come and see now the beast did come and see and then watch it a little bit it's not the beast that speaks next it's the lamb speaking right right the beast said come and see in other words i'm going to now show you what's taking place so come and see all right what do you see and i'll be held in the black horse and he that said on him had a pair of balances in his hand now that's a symbol right that's a symbol all right we'll get to that in a minute and he heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say a measure of wheat for a penny three measures of barley etc so what is it saying let's go on to number six we'll start on the third seal okay fire out to 64. the third seal this writer is the same one but another stage of his ministry the first stage of white horsey he was just a teaching just an antichrist teaching he was against the word of god and now how can you be an enter now how can you be an antichrist anybody that denies every word of this isn't true and to be taught just the same is an antichrist because they deny the word and he's the word anybody teaching contrary to the word is antichrist but on this third stage he's in another ministry another stage of the church look at the next one which will be a long reading verb 273 the same writer this first stage he was innocent and second now if you want to get a little bit higher a little more than that in the second stage the bible said he'd be given a crown and they crowned a man a superman they crowned him and then the bible didn't call him a pope bible don't say he's a pope right that's demystracy he's a false prophet all right the bible called him a false prophet well yeah of course he must be a false prophet by his antichrist spirit that started a taught antichrist against the original word because if you thought against the original word it was antichrist it was and the word is god's seek christ all right now after that we find him then crown when he got crowned but he's a very innocent helpless and he's backgrounding to bring it up to where the seal will open you you're going to see a book i've asked you to do it to read notice he spends a vast amount of time laying a background before he tells you what the seal is right sure that's not just playing around that's a background you see me background a lot i back up on the message prior why because they're all tight again so watch him he's just a little fella but then and i see him counseling the constantine gave him all the property and then what did he do then satan gave him his strong and authority nathan gave to this man this pope the bible said so as we have went through it now the next thing we find out that the devil controls all the politics that has ever been or ever will be we find that in matthew 4 11 and now we find out that satan already had politics but he's trying to get to church and he already had the government because that's what he's saying but jesus remember when he was taken up he said i'll give you all of this because it belonged to that was the that was the governmental right that was the world the system the government's all governments all right now what does he want he's got to get the church but he's trying to get to church so he goes down to deceive it he gets his superman works him into an organization and crowns him background see of christ christ acted instead of god see this guy's a backer instead of god see just the same instead of god what he's supposed to be a viker under christ now we know he's not a viking to christ that would have been all right that he stayed down but that wasn't true now when he did that then what did he do then satan took his political power which he was already over you know governments and took the religious power which had already been crowned he put them together and he made him another crime over hell right and when they had passed on oh if they pay enough money you get them out see now he's biker over to heaven over purgatory as he wants to call it no such thing in the bible see but he added it to me but he had to make something the bible said he come out of the bottomless pit and he returns back the same on to that now what does he do he makes him another place called purgatory right now watch the darkness the catholic church ruled the world over what they called the dark ages for about a thousand years fleece to people of all their money all right charge you know we'll get to it in a second for prayers how horrible can anybody be they would charge you for a prayer now brother we want you to come down for joe and him george says gwen we went up yesterday and we dedicated her home beautiful home they got there man you get lost tonight i couldn't do which floor i lived on but anyhow we went down we prayed for it but wouldn't that be something they said well brother dale you you and the church come up dedicate her home it's gonna cost you yeah and it did because then they fed us like a king had two big old turkeys or big old hens or something cooked and food just running out every which way sure it is but wouldn't it be something to charge for a prayer yeah well my baby's sick well how much you give me to come down now you say now that ain't gonna happen that's why i run around and stay away from money because he knew what it was and wrong money love of money is the root of all not money no problem what you do with it right what about somebody would charge somebody to pray for people you go to funerals you do funerals you do weddings i know it's a kind of a customary thing to give the pressure of the money but i don't ever want it right i'd really give it back to the people that really needs it not the couple that's getting married to mom and daddy on each side they're the ones that need it give it to them all right but how horrible could you ever be that you charge at somebody for praying you don't get it but maybe they know what they're talking about let's go to number eight all right i've got a good bit of reading off of this one you'll notice this is a continual reading paragraph after paragraph paragraph 294 to 95 goes up to 300 and now here is the mystery of this and that when it revealed to me early this morning poor daylight now that was this third seal you know what it was until then then i went quickly to the scripture to begin to look search it up here it is three of them so far has been absolutely supernaturally revealed that's right now here is the mixture of the black horse according to what it was revealed to me he had started writing in the time of the dark ages that's what the dark horse meant the dark ages which you'll see in a minute brother brown brings it to the in here to the tie tower in the middle age right when it got into the set this morning the moon just went almost out but there was no light he starts writing him in the time of the dark ages that's what the dark horse represented the dark ages where it was a time of midnight to the true believers that was left and it was some god it was even midnight horrible right watch now in that church age that middle church age our dark church age watch how he says you just have a little strength you read that in your fourth church it was a midnight to them for the midnight to them for the true believer now watch practically all hope had been taken from the true church by this fellow controlled both church and state we no such thing as saying well we'll just we can go down to the government and argue no you differed with them it's automatic debt and the guy got a prize for killing you they had a killing group there that i won't call the name of because it is in there but they just had a joy killing one man it recorded him killing a thousand people in one night a thousand people he killed now how many of them people did he pray for and ask him to get converted or what did he do he just went out and slit throats killed a thousand people one night what are they going to do see catholicism had taken over both church and state and all didn't agree with them because catholicism was killed that's the reason he was on a dark horse and watch what a dark thing he done see then he can see then you can see you just i if you know your history watch it and you well you won't have to even know get to know this and watch all hope was gone that's his black horse and he rode on his white horse hunting he gave power took pity slaughtered the minions that's what he was going to do as he rode on through and he still does it now here he is on the black horse now coming for dark age that was that time just about the time after the church got set up and got in power they smothered out everything else and went through about hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years it's really a thousand years for what it was whatever readers know that was the dark age how many knows that sure the dark age there's your dark horse representing the dark age what's now now all hope's gone no hope at all everything looked dark for the little believers now that's the reason this call represented a dark horse do you get the symbol of the horse name but watch it killing the people was one thing but what's this here's where your darkness comes in his balances are scales in his hand you see called out now if you'll notice in your scripture he has the the scales says come and see he had a pair of balances in his hand well that wasn't too bad so god to let us know for sure he's the one that says a measure a week for a penny not even the combat beast the lamb cries this out because he wants us to know all right watch it keep that point in mind man he's balancing his scales in his ansi calling out a measure a week for a penny pre-leaders would barley for a penny see actually that yes wheat and barley is natural staff of life that's what bread and stuff's made from but you see he was charging for this they not only had the governmental charging for the bread right right i remember this you'll see him interlacing it he was actually charging for bread that's what run around will cover it watch it that's what bread is just made from and we don't go spiritual that's when it gets worse right what it means that he was charging his subjects for the kind of hope of life that he was sending out to them by making he started in that very time of making them pay for prayer charge it for prior they still do it no venus is that the way you pronounce the word no venuses of course what was he doing capturing the wealth of the world the scale weighing out a measure of wheat repenting and three measures of barley for a penny the writer on the black horse seed he was making stripping his subjects of their money when the bible predicts that he holds what the bible predicts that he holds about the wealth of the world and we said last night about russia and all that they just take all the money and just strip the people everything they got and run around said that was what caused communism to be like it was right that they were there fleecing the people of everything they had and he said communism rose up to stop that system of the catholic church you've heard him tell about little petito or what his name was little they got all these golden alders and these candles burning on them been over there in brazil and seen it i felt the excuse well it was in brazil too all these little things man it's just you're talking about uh we go down to look at the markets and see all this stuff and there it was you could buy any kind of candle you want any kind of thing to go burn for the dead we see they're taught if they don't do that right and all the catholics are wonderful people they make you pay for prayers right pay to pay mom and daddy out of purgatory you know that there's such good people you know what they do one time a year one day a year one day a year they have what they call all science day you know what that means everybody's prayers goes to father without extra charge so the poor can get his purse in to get his grandma out of purgatory all saints day that's what it's called all the prayers can go and i'm not joking you know just a hand a nose but i was there and witnessed them and you know i'm like i look around trying to figure things out they said oh this big old guy on this yeah and we have an all saints day i mean all the prayers goes up well the next day sorry you can't pay for it your prayers don't go through right that's no joke right it's true now wouldn't that be something it wouldn't be something to charge for prayer how much you paid the way we get down to the preachers in the end time if we have time now notice do you see where that whole money money taken in church comes from that's right now what's he saying the russians we need to ever service past the plate he's in service is not complete without passing the plate but now what's he talking about do you see where those old money-making money taken in church comes from get away from that stuff what i do to build an organization a big something a million dollars here and you see what the mother of it is there's not an organization in the world that don't have a great big headquarters of multi-million dollar buildings right pretty large within this message amen if you need it and can afford it praise the lord we could use a bigger build you know we could use more comfortable or something and that's fine but are we looking at the buildings are releasing god amen i mean you gotta sit uncomfortable here or are we too cold or too hot oh yeah we have all this other it's all right you talk to him thank you lord oh my i'm so glad yes sir all right it's been his grace that's all all right it's a midnight time do you understand that now and here he is charging for for the kind of life that's this barley and stuff natural it wasn't spiritual watch man now it was barley must have said watch him he's interlacing now they were charging the people for food all right that's one thing that might be all right but when you start charging for prayers right you know how the old saying used to be water was free look at barley bread and wheat bread he was charging for that kind of a life that he was giving to his subjects charging for the prayer charging for prayer by the priests to pray people out of purgatory charging them i'm taking this one out of history charging for i guess it's novena i guess everybody knows what novena i guess that's something you have to do you know some tenants coming out to charge for that bringing the wealth of the world to him and to himself into the church itself and he's still riding i'm sure he's still running look at it look at where he's down okay let's just put this one in here watch this one i've searched for this one the wording of it i knew what brother ryan said but i needed the wording to get out of the computer i searched it all yesterday and this morning and back here i finally picked it up while i go so we just start right here we're talking about the third beast that satan's in out it became true this is the fifth seal or 19 uh 150 one money-making scheme a measure a week for a penny three measures monthly for penny the online the money-making scheme the shrewdness to get the gold of the world and the wealth brought into it that's exactly fulfilled that's what began to charge for prayers and for make a place called purgatory and you prayed their ancestors and pray their ancestors out and you had to will your deeds and everything your property the church and it was the state was assigned the church taking your property over right and once program 154. don't you see some of these evangelists this day still have that same anointing on them making old people give up their pensions and leading their home over to certain things my brother i i don't want to get onto that he said i'll just stay right with this what about it guys bringing in millions of dollars a year and yet they're out there telling them you know you want to see a good pentecost will take up an offer and he'll fleece you forever down you got in your pocket we were sitting one night a certain brother i won't call his name but he was taking up an offer and brother whitby poked me in the ribs he said he knows what he's doing i seen him pull ten thousand dollars in one offering in a meeting of them even pulled my wife into it because she punched me and she's gonna walk down and lay your hundred dollars down no that's what he said lay a hundred dollars down come down like a hundred dollars tonight nobody ain't gonna lay a hundred dollars down i know i'm hate from an arrogant but i didn't walk down i didn't put my hundred dollars an offer and play much probably a good bit more on giveaway that's not enough rest of you i'll let another hundred dollars now i know i mean what i wanted to do i wanted to do it i wanted to bankrupt the dale clown and i wanted to walk down there and say you let 100 down all day 100 with you one of us is gonna run out of money because you made the challenge because see i knew what he was doing i'm not hateful i knew what he was doing he was pulling them people for their money my one brother said one time he said i'll take the last hundred dollars from a woman as well as anybody who ever hears that you know i'm talking about it but he don't care i tell him to his face i was the one that made that statement right your prophet never went for money like that did he he fired a campaign manager because he took up an offering now they had free will offered they had love offerings but he fired one man because he took up an offering he said he did he said but brother tell us you gotta you know you you've got to do something to encourage people yeah i told you about it i was fixing to help support a brother and still sends me a lot of letters and i was interested in helping him on a foreign field and i won't mention word or what but we was in a meeting and that's something was said and he said yeah i said when we we have a services set we'll have people deliberately go to the altar did what he said yeah i said we'll send people down to the altar okay so people know all about these things he said because you got to get the people started once you get them started they'll come i went and i never gave them out of dime and never will because i don't believe in making up nothing they'll get together these meetings they'll tell doves hit under the thing and the preacher all these doves and how they go flying all over the place you think that old devil ain't still here he's riding this white it's red and it's black right he's getting pretty close to palm right but your prophet said that's what these evangelists do i'm calling his name but you remember when he got in trouble recently you know a year or so ago he was bringing in 130 something million dollars a year but if you turn it on to his broadcast what was it we've got to have money yeah we've got to have money send us so much money we've got we know that there's people out there right now sitting on thousands of dollars in your pocket and you need to come and get it because god will bless you if you don't give it he won't bless you your house is going to burn your cross is going to get destroyed it's that same old devil back there in the black darkness charging for prayers a day comes here when i gotta ask you for a dime this place won't exist it's never been on money right it never will be all right we've got to have money to live we got to do right but not to pull it out of people and scare them to death you know because that's that darkness right it's upon the land they came into the next one is the question answered on the seals our 291 that's the only thing he could do there's only one thing left for this united states to do i hear people that say run around and said so until watch it now remember this is william brown see speaking this is my idea it's only presuming just look at it in the natural standpoint which may be a million miles off i do believe that right there in that money the love of money is the root of all evil and i believe right a long entire will start the ball rolling all right now the catholic church back there from charging for prayers and so forth holds wealth to the world you remember the bible said that she was rich and how she was and remember wall street and see you think it's just catholics she's rich in every nation there is under heaven she's reaching out watching she has the money what they don't have wall street has which is controlled by the jews the catholics have the gold the jews have the stops and bonds there's got to be a covenant between them that's right yes sir a natural jew is not going to give up his money all right so he's got to make a contract yeah you think about a darkness amen we're going to get dark when we get out of here that's right look at the next 323. and what does it say to this writer in black and we'll read it in a minute it's not the combat beast that says it it's the lamb it may be in this one here but what does it say to this writer in black don't you hurt my wine and my oil don't you touch my wine and oil now i got just a little bit of it down there but there's still a little bit there yes sir and you can go on go and measure out all kind of life that you're putting out that's up to you you're going to pay this is like god speaking you're going to pay for it down there but when you come across that wine oil you leave it alone you think he wouldn't die during the dark ages amen he was dire might have been that little light we talked about this morning but he was there don't touch my oil and wine first one the others would always the combat beasts that come and see and so and so come and see and so on now it says come and see but tell a voice from the midst of the comment at least it says in your scripture don't you hurt in other words like this if you catch some of my little flock that's filled with my oil and wine the wine and oil of the pure word and you're going to kill them because you you're doing that that's what you're doing don't you force them to say hail mary's or do anything like that are some of your creeds you keep your hands off them they know where they're going or they are anointed with my oil and by being anointed with my oil they have the wine of joy because they know my word of promise i'm going to raise them up again don't hurt what i'm going to raise them up again don't hurt that don't go trying to measure their message messing them up just cause just keep away from that in other words he's telling him you kill him but don't you try to make him say those things why because he was there watch it see what he says that's what i love about it surely that dark age those little sights down through their thoughts gone in here words are gone now let me say this about the end time don't you think in this day that most of the churches around this world in the message churches are wondering where god is at how many of you are wondering where he's at well brother dale if we had god among us we could just ask him what about it i've done read over and over and over to you god does those things to try you to see whether you're genuine or not right to see whether you'll stand or not what hopes would you have if you were out there trying to find a church to go to hey folks we ain't built lulu we never have so don't you worry about it i've always told you and i always have preached that there's more preachers around this world there's more churches following this truth than you can think of it's really trying right amen watch you just keep away from them he vindicates his words and bring it in they know they knew they'd rise again oh well i like that we they'll rise again you're cause of black horse riding now dark ages i went to white horse you've seen what he's done perfectly here comes a red horse you see what it's done here comes the black horse you see the same writer all the time what's he doing right on down through the ages you find out he measured it out at charge smart exactly weak natural natural light what they was living home but symbolizing spirit more enjoy the wine that spiritual life don't hurt them leave it alone in other words wrong don't you touch it it's mine that belongs to me what now i've got another thing here i want you to notice notice it was not one of the four beasts that said don't touch the oil in the wine watch it did you notice that the four beasts have been talking once let me just read out here just a little bit see a measure of a penny for uh when you prefer a penny and three measures of barley per penny and see i heard not the only one i look here and i heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts what was it the lamb amen it wasn't the four beasts the lamb said why he said why he's going to take his own that belongs to him he's redeemed it see don't you touch that oil no sir not the four beasts but the lamb was the one that said it now oh my the lamb not the four beasts didn't announce this lamb said it itself when the 4b said come and see and they went and they sing it like that he said a measure of wheat for a penny mark but then the lamb cried out right among them and said don't you hurt the oil in mine oh my listen to it don't you hurt it boy or you're going to pay for it someday and they will they will that's right it'll be paid for one day you talk about a darkness you talk about a town that's coming right we think about being dark in egypt until they couldn't even move but there was light in motion those writers are still writing but brother dale we're out here we're at the time of the great revelation i agree with you a hundred percent but if it's not true revelation is not light right amen yep right the only thing we have how many times i've made this statement the only thing i have of the word of god is what's been revealed to me not what i've read in the book that's laying on the pages of the book and the prophet said can be questioned as long as laying there but he said when it's revealed into your heart it can't be questioned right that's right you see why i'm so stern about the way i am and the way i preach because it's in the book it's in the book right i've got the book i understand what it says and i believe it well who do you think you are well you know it's easy to reverse that statement and who do you think you are come and let's see let's talk about the message and see god has not left his little bride he didn't under dark ages he was right there with him that's the point i'm trying to get you to see we can see the symbols and the things but right out in the middle of the symbols the symbol is the the oil you know the measure of weak for opinion and things because that was the balances that the combat beast said come and see it's like all the others that was a symbol of it the dark ages the things but god speaks out he said don't you hurt my oil in my mind he was right there to make sure they didn't get hurt amen sure they were killed by the millions that's right but not one of them had to pray anybody out of purgatory that's right amen no one of them had to pray anybody out and they didn't have to be prayed out right you just think how dark it would be for you setting listen to somebody that what if i had and you you really believe that i had the power as a preacher to be able to excommunicate you out of our fellowship which would mean you're lost that's what it means to be excommunicated that's correct day martin luther was put out of the catholic church his name went off the record right amen he wasn't one of them that they killed thinking they're doing god's service he was put off the record right what about the church trying to make it simple for me and you all right amen those horses are still here the white the red and the black are still here right can't be the pale until we get out of here right you can't get on that horse until we get out of here yeah so he's still sitting on his black and weight we'll read it from it prophet says you read the fourth seal he said we go up he comes down amen can't be the beast until we get out of here you think who's in control god's in control that's right but if we hit that third seal to think about him saying don't you hurt my oil in my mind i'm here and i'm here to show you you're not gonna hurt him right you may kill him but you're not gonna destroy him all right you're not gonna scare him with your little booger tricks of hell in purgatory that's why i've always tried my best to tell you mommas and daddies don't scare your children with heaven and hell don't scare them with boogerman tails don't tell them don't go in that dark it might be a booger man in there don't tell them stuff like that you're setting things in their mind you're scaring them to death get them in warfare and say don't go in there if you go in there i'll whip you right he ain't afraid of boogerman no more he's afraid of you don't scare them all right heard people tell them jesus don't love you you're doing wrong oh i want to get that person by the hair of the head and say let me talk to you a little bit jesus don't like you either but you see that's what we do let all them things trickle down until we become a horse that the devil is riding as i said this morning how many people in how many churches in this message will tell you if you leave them you're excommunicated you're lost turn around one time i ain't making a joke ain't making i'm telling the truth i heard a man one time that told a fellow he wanted to he was he'd backslid for years he said you pay your tithe up you can come back to church and be a member of us if you don't pay up your back time you can't be here would that be nice you tell me that ain't that same old devil he's charging for prayers and things but you see those people can say those things everybody thinks they're good people i just don't think that way i like what brother woodley said about it one time he said if my mama is the devil she's a devil well he wasn't meaning his mama was the devil it was at the moment what she was he wasn't throwing off on his mama right he was just saying if mama's a devil she's the devil what hopes do we have now how many people in this message did you know of because that's all we know about right why do they believe we're going to get a new body because they don't believe god is capable of making this one new well now you're controlled by those things what about the brother that preached the thunder virtue message he was going to tell you when you had certain virtues but of course the bigger payer in the pocket and the tide man was going to get the virtues quicker you say oh no oh yes why not just be sensible have i ever put that form of the thing before you here as a money scheming outfit or something to try to get your money no i give you all well because that money's got a bad taste to me your prophet said if you knew what you had in your pocket you take it out and burn it now he didn't do it right because he knew we we're living in this society but when you let your money get ahead of your will of god that's right amen you're doing wrong simple little things of thinking about darkness the bible says what now we ended up let's see if i can perforate it if that light is within you become dark that's with it how great is that darkness sure if we turn down this message we've gone into darkness but how many can do who can determine what turning down would be that's right when the great apostle paul said causing people to blaspheme it's what he said what he was doing that's right he said causing people to bless me you know god saved you that's why don't throw off on nobody i want grace for everybody especially for me but i don't want to be in that darkness but there's no hope would it be something if you had your eyes put out right amen once you're just in total darkness right yeah right you're at the mercy and i'm doing to somebody else right whether it be a cni dog or whether it be a person to lead you around i want to be under god's mercy don't you let's stand i want to be under god's mercy i want to be what he wants me to be what about it i want to live the way he wants me to live i want to be what he wants me to be think on these things just remember where we got here let's try that i want to live the way he wants me to live amen amen let me get inside here i want to get it let's get out of the darkness okay uh in the name of jesus i want to christ you know what we're going to do we're going down to for the baptismal service and all there won't be any dave ramsey class this afternoon it will be next sunday not this afternoon so we want to go there have a baptismal service anybody that wants to get baptized you just come along we got the water we just need you to come alone our brother wants to get baptized that's a wonderful thing everybody'll do that remember that okay father we thank you we love you and lord jesus we just ask you to help us guide us give understanding to each and every one that we may walk in the light of your loving grace and be guided by you forgive our sins lord cleanse us as we go to have a baptismal service to baptize our brother we believe you lord that you said if we repent be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the mission of sins we shall receive the gift of the holy ghost so we believe that you'll take care of all times given to us those things guide us now be with each and every one be where everybody on the way home give a safe journey may your love be made manifest in our hearts in jesus name amen
