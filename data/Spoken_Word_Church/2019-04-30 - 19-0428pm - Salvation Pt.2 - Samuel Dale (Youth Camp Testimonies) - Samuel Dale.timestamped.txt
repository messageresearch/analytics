[9:58] well have the young people tell about
[10:01] their experiences at Louisiana youth
[10:05] camp this Easter weekend this was I
[10:09] guess it was just trying to think about
[10:13] it 24 years ago the 98 21 years ago
[10:19] no okay 21 he's no say richard.reimers I
[10:24] don't he's just trying to remember how
[10:26] many years ago it was but it's been
[10:27] quite a few but had a wonderful time and
[10:32] got to see some of the some brothers and
[10:36] sisters hadn't seen in quite some time
[10:38] and had a wonderful time and Lord really
[10:41] moved believe it really touched some of
[10:44] the young people there really moved in
[10:45] their lives and I believe some of them
[10:47] received the new birth there and had
[10:51] quite a few testimonies and everybody
[10:54] wants wants me to get they just go out
[11:02] this doing okay it's not like he just
[11:05] went out but anyway so I'm gonna tell
[11:07] tell a little bit about my experiences
[11:10] later but didn't want to did want to say
[11:12] that the on the way down brother Matthew
[11:18] braid got us a room in and mobile so
[11:20] Levon totally by he had two choices
[11:25] about going to Louisiana camp this year
[11:27] he could go the easy way or the hard way
[11:29] but he went the easy way but you know I
[11:34] think it's a wonderful thing for young
[11:35] people to go and experience and like we
[11:41] got the mobile spent the night somebody
[11:43] broke in my truck and they stole my
[11:46] laptop my GPS and few other things but
[11:48] just wanted to say that they didn't get
[11:51] my they didn't get my Bible my tablet
[11:54] here so thank the Lord for that and they
[11:57] didn't get my pistol for some reason
[11:58] they left they got in the console this
[12:01] was laying on top of my pistol they
[12:03] opened the console they pulled this out
[12:05] they pulled the pistol out they laid the
[12:07] tablet back in there and close the lid
[12:09] and then they left the pistol and in the
[12:10] passenger floorboard but they stole my
[12:14] laptop so but I was thinking I was
[12:17] telling some of the brothers down there
[12:18] it's like well I remember about brother
[12:20] colleagues rifles getting stolen and we
[12:23] called for it and they came back and I
[12:24] told myself scene garden do bigger
[12:26] things than that besides returning a
[12:28] laptop and so he's the same yesterday
[12:31] today and forever so y'all just notice
[12:35] continue to pray but it's nothing's too
[12:38] hard for God and so I just believe it'll
[12:41] it'll turn up and I don't know where
[12:44] it's at but God knows and God knows how
[12:46] to bring it back so sister Esther if you
[12:49] want to come and start we're gonna start
[12:52] with her and get the rest of the young
[12:54] people so to start off my testimony I'm
[12:59] gonna go ahead and thank poppy and nany
[13:01] for providing us with the money to go to
[13:04] this camp so when you're going to a
[13:08] meeting about to get a blessing you know
[13:10] the devil is gonna come around and be
[13:12] like no you're not getting anything so
[13:14] that's what he tried to do to me and I
[13:17] knew it was him so I was like I'm not
[13:20] gonna listen to you but in the back of
[13:21] my mind I was still worried like you
[13:23] know what if I don't get anything so uh
[13:25] I get there I go through the prayer line
[13:30] and stuff and I don't really feel
[13:31] anything and so the devil is like see
[13:35] you don't feel anything you didn't get
[13:36] anything but it wasn't really till after
[13:39] the camp when usually I would start
[13:41] wanting to do the things I used to do
[13:43] and I realized I didn't want to do those
[13:45] things anymore God took that desire out
[13:48] of my heart so it doesn't emotions don't
[13:51] really matter it's the desire taken out
[13:55] of you that is what counts so I just
[13:58] want to thank God for that
[14:06] Olivia will get Josiah next so first I
[14:19] do want to thank the church and poppy
[14:21] nanny for letting us go to this camp and
[14:23] I wanted to thank brother homeless
[14:25] church for providing a way to go to the
[14:26] cam
[14:27] and I wanted to start by saying with I
[14:30] went to camp with a couple things on
[14:32] mind I put a Perry requesting well a
[14:36] month ago for a friend named Christian
[14:39] he was struggling with health problems
[14:42] and he had a recently go to the doctor
[14:44] because he had cancer and so he doesn't
[14:47] have anymore cancer but he hasn't been
[14:49] able to eat for two months without
[14:51] vomiting or throwing something up so I
[14:54] went to camp with him on my mind and
[14:57] whenever I got back from camp he told me
[14:59] that he has been able to eat without
[15:02] going up like for the past about week
[15:05] now so I really wanted to thank that and
[15:08] how I could tell was the first night of
[15:11] camp there's first service that we went
[15:14] to at all ok the first service that we
[15:20] went to I prayed for him and I just felt
[15:23] like this feeling that he was healed and
[15:25] that he couldn't get hurt again by
[15:28] whatever he had cuz the doctors didn't
[15:30] know what he had and a couple days later
[15:33] he told me that he's been able to keep
[15:36] down his food and it was that day that
[15:38] he felt better that day that minute that
[15:40] I prayed for him and I thought that was
[15:42] great
[15:49] I like to start out by thanking the
[15:53] church for letting us go pop your nanny
[15:55] and her brother's home her church for
[15:57] letting us drive down there and I like
[16:00] to I received a personal blessing from
[16:03] brother Andrew Glover and brother Donnie
[16:06] who preached there they put they
[16:07] preached amazing services on mechanics
[16:10] and dynamics and just how God can help
[16:12] you in your darkest times and I would
[16:15] seize the blessing from camp and one of
[16:19] the biggest points throughout camp was
[16:20] don't just if when you receive something
[16:23] from God don't leave it at camp don't
[16:24] leave it in Louisiana just take it home
[16:26] with you so thank you everyone
[16:31] [Applause]
[16:39] yes I want to thank the church for
[16:44] rosedale my own these people the gun
[16:49] people to go and I also want to say I
[16:53] appreciate all the prayers for everybody
[16:55] praying for them I know people around
[16:58] the world you know some of other
[17:03] countries that have been there and you
[17:05] know they send their greetings to the
[17:08] young people at camp and tell them you
[17:09] know even though we're not there we're
[17:10] still praying for you and it was it's
[17:13] just a really a blessing but just want
[17:18] to give have a little testimony to give
[17:21] about the but the prayer line every
[17:24] every Saturday night that they have a
[17:27] prayer line and and have all the
[17:31] ministers come and you know all week
[17:36] they they preach on having on having
[17:38] faith and and claiming what God has
[17:41] given you and it was just it was an
[17:46] amazing amazing thing I was I was
[17:50] blessed by the word but you know it's
[17:51] it's it's a blessing to see somebody
[17:54] else get blessed and and to see the kids
[17:58] you know some of them just like Esther
[18:01] and number talking about so many of them
[18:02] come
[18:03] questions and the devil just you know
[18:06] just really beats on them and you know
[18:09] they're coming to get a blessing and the
[18:11] devil fights them all the way and you
[18:12] know some of them they have a lot of
[18:14] questions in their minds and in their
[18:16] hearts when they get there but you know
[18:17] the thing is is you just start trusting
[18:21] God and you know you listen to the word
[18:23] go forth and you know to build faith and
[18:26] and you know the promises of God are
[18:28] yeah and amen they and they're yours and
[18:32] all you have to do is claim them but I
[18:35] just want to give everybody want me to
[18:37] talk about the the prayer line so I just
[18:41] want to briefly talk about that just
[18:47] about everybody there seemed like it
[18:50] went on forever but it was it was a
[18:52] blessing but there were three people
[18:55] that come through the prayer line that
[18:56] we dealt with that had demons and they
[19:02] were cast out while they while we were
[19:04] there and and to see that and a lot of
[19:06] young people who had never seen anything
[19:09] like that before had never experienced
[19:11] anything like that but you know it was
[19:13] one thing that brother Andrew was
[19:15] talking about was you know you start to
[19:17] see that those spirits are real and
[19:20] brother Brent I'm talking about those
[19:21] spirits and you know people just we've
[19:24] heard a lot of people talk about the
[19:26] ministry talk about it and we've heard
[19:27] brother Branham talk about it everything
[19:29] like that
[19:29] but it's but it comes to a point where
[19:31] you actually see those things manifest
[19:33] it changes your outlook and your because
[19:37] you know those spirits are regal that
[19:39] you're fighting a real spirit but the
[19:41] thing is is the Spirit of God is just is
[19:44] greater than that he's just as real as
[19:47] that we don't see in that other realm
[19:48] but but it's really there and a lot of
[19:51] people think was just some kind of
[19:53] hocus-pocus or or something like that
[19:55] but you start dealing with that and then
[19:56] all of a sudden people start I mean they
[19:58] the kids were a lot of the kids were had
[20:00] never seen anything like that and they
[20:01] had were really talking about what they
[20:05] had had seen but anyway there was there
[20:07] was three people that come through the
[20:09] line and the first lady that that came
[20:12] to his life she came with her husband
[20:13] because the prayer line is open to
[20:15] anybody in the
[20:16] anybody there at the meetings so we
[20:18] prayed for parents grandparents
[20:20] everybody but this lady she came through
[20:22] and she as soon as she got in the the
[20:25] beginning of the prayer line I was out
[20:27] back toward the end and as soon as she
[20:30] came through I don't know if anybody's
[20:33] ever dealt with spirits if you've ever
[20:35] seen a demon brother branham said you
[20:37] ever see how somebody's countenance
[20:40] changes when dealt when the devil is
[20:42] about to be exposed and if you ever seen
[20:44] that take place you can see them in
[20:46] their eyes their countless changes
[20:49] sometimes their eyes bug out sometimes
[20:51] their eyes roll back in their head they
[20:53] they jerk and contort I mean it's just
[20:57] an amazing thing that people what was
[20:59] going on but you know we she was just
[21:03] all up all over the place and they were
[21:05] they were praying for her but they got
[21:07] her down on the floor after she was all
[21:10] over the brothers were trying to hold
[21:12] him to her and pray for it she was going
[21:15] kind of ballistic there and she after
[21:17] they finally got her down they started
[21:19] talking to her and they started speaking
[21:21] to that spirit and you know they had to
[21:23] call it lots of times you'll see
[21:25] somebody when this takes place you know
[21:28] their eyes roll back in their head or
[21:29] whatever and if you call their name and
[21:31] you speak to them you speak to that
[21:32] spirit and you tell them you let them
[21:34] come through youto and then you all of a
[21:37] sudden they'll come the person is back
[21:38] there and you can talk to them but the
[21:40] thing is is you've got to get the person
[21:42] that's bound by the spirit you've got to
[21:44] get that person to confess and cast that
[21:47] spirit out the Bible says in my name
[21:49] shall they cast out devils well that's
[21:51] not the preachers having to do that
[21:52] that's the person that's bound it's got
[21:54] to get to the point to cast the spirit
[21:56] out but we they dealt with her for quite
[21:59] a while we prayed for over 30 minutes
[22:01] with her and then the finally some of
[22:02] the brothers took her off the back room
[22:04] and they continued to pray for her and
[22:06] she was delivered after the service but
[22:08] they can the brothers continue to pray
[22:10] for her but there was another young lady
[22:12] that was a I would say she was about 18
[22:15] years old and I don't know what it was
[22:20] but as soon as she got in the prayer
[22:23] line it was just just manifesting and
[22:26] her and it was really fighting the
[22:28] brother
[22:29] and everything and they were just trying
[22:30] to hold on to her and just they were
[22:33] praying and casting that thing out and
[22:35] it wasn't it wasn't long it was maybe 10
[22:39] minutes or something but anyway she just
[22:42] fell to the floor like a box of rocks
[22:44] I mean she just hit the floor hard and
[22:46] the thing was gone and when she when she
[22:49] came back to herself she was fine but
[22:53] there was a there was a little black
[22:54] brother he come through the prayer line
[22:55] and as when he came through one of the
[23:02] brothers that was was there he called he
[23:04] called a spirit on him and this this
[23:07] brother he just walked through the
[23:08] prayer line but the brother caught the
[23:10] spirit and he watched him leave the
[23:13] platform well we finished we finished
[23:16] the prayer line and then it started that
[23:20] manifest started acting up and one of
[23:23] the brothers had had mentioned to
[23:24] brother Tim Pruitt about it well I
[23:26] didn't see I didn't hear what was going
[23:28] on I just happened to see something was
[23:29] going on well by the time we got over
[23:31] there the brother was in one of the
[23:32] chairs at the second row and his head
[23:35] was down between his knees I thought he
[23:38] had passed out or he was sick or
[23:40] something I didn't realize what was
[23:40] going on
[23:41] and they didn't say anything to us so
[23:44] anyway we just started making her way
[23:45] over to where he was but that's when
[23:50] when the what was so amazing was when he
[23:54] went down and passed out or whatever in
[23:56] the chair all these boys that are from
[23:59] his dorm like 13 to 15 years old all
[24:03] these brothers that were around him all
[24:04] these young men they went over and they
[24:07] were the ones praying for him when the
[24:09] minister's got over to where he was and
[24:11] so when we come over there one of the
[24:13] brothers was trying to talk to him and
[24:15] trying to revive him well the brother
[24:18] that had seen the spirit they said I
[24:21] seen you sniggered and everything he
[24:23] said I seen that spirit and he said I
[24:24] walked over and he started talking to
[24:25] him well when we got there and that
[24:27] brother started talking to him then that
[24:29] thing started coming out and then that
[24:32] was the one that we saw that actually
[24:35] spoke to us
[24:36] and I was standing there and I was
[24:41] closer
[24:42] about half the distance between me and
[24:44] brother Kali and that thing was talking
[24:46] and you know it was they tried to talk
[24:52] to him they asked what they the brother
[24:54] knew what kind of spirit it was he said
[24:55] you're you're a spirit of and he said
[24:59] yes the spirit answered but they showed
[25:03] him a picture of the pillar of fire
[25:04] brother had it on his phone he showed it
[25:06] to him and he showed him a picture of
[25:08] the pillar fire he said this is a
[25:09] manifestation of your Creator and I
[25:12] thing wouldn't look at it would look at
[25:14] the picture of pillar fire kept turned
[25:16] his head and he said you look at me and
[25:18] all of a sudden that spirit looked at
[25:21] that looked at that brother and he said
[25:22] this is a manifestation of your Creator
[25:24] and he said yes I had a real deep voice
[25:29] to be spoke but it was it was an amazing
[25:32] thing that a lot of those kids had never
[25:34] seen anything like that but you know
[25:35] they kept the they got the brother to
[25:38] start reading the scripture in quoting
[25:40] the scripture it's because you know you
[25:43] have to make this thing leave and so
[25:45] when they started asking this brother
[25:47] and they started giving him the
[25:48] scriptures to read and he said that
[25:49] things would just come up and start
[25:51] messing with his mouth and contorting
[25:54] and and they would say you be quiet and
[25:57] let him speak and it would come right
[25:59] back and he would start speaking but we
[26:02] prayed for him for quite awhile but he
[26:03] finally he finally was able to cast that
[26:07] thing out but we just kept praying for
[26:10] him and praying for him but it was him
[26:11] speaking and him telling it and
[26:14] afterwards I have to late after they
[26:17] dismiss because he come up front and
[26:19] said he was free from that spirit and
[26:21] then when he left we had walked out and
[26:26] some of the brothers had went with him
[26:28] outside and was walking him back to his
[26:32] dorm well by the time he got to his dorm
[26:35] me and brother Jonathan Jones some of
[26:36] y'all know brother Jonathan we were
[26:38] outside walking I seen him in the
[26:39] distance sitting in front of his dorm
[26:41] and I seen that spirit coming back and
[26:43] he was act just contorting and and
[26:46] getting all educated everything there
[26:48] was a brother Center trying to talk to
[26:49] him and I walked back over and we were
[26:52] talking to him
[26:55] but it was manifesting he was fighting
[26:57] him and so brother Jonathan some of
[27:00] those other brothers we took him back to
[27:01] the church back to the back room and sat
[27:03] him down in a chair and he kept trying
[27:05] to we kept trying to talk to him
[27:07] to have faith and the thing is for him
[27:10] to confess he needed to confess and
[27:13] every things in his life that he didn't
[27:14] that he needed to confess and he finally
[27:16] just started talking to us and they said
[27:19] well the thing is I see it's not when
[27:20] you as soon as you expose Satan Satan
[27:23] has no power if you have if there's fear
[27:26] and there's a few things I want to only
[27:29] share well after after he'd done that
[27:31] and he was free we prayed for him and it
[27:33] was free of that one of the brothers
[27:36] said okay so we're gonna take you get
[27:37] baptized because you've repented there
[27:40] you get baptized because the only way
[27:41] you're gonna keep that thing away from
[27:43] you is to receive the Holy Ghost you
[27:45] need the Holy Ghost and he said well
[27:46] I've already been baptized and they said
[27:47] well we're gonna go get baptized again
[27:49] so we took him down to the water and the
[27:51] brother baptized but he said the next
[27:53] morning off all three of them were free
[27:55] of their spirits those unclean spirits
[27:58] had been passed but I just got a couple
[28:06] of things here I don't want to share
[28:07] with you number one
[28:10] the one thing that brought him and all
[28:12] the ministers always talked about even
[28:14] brother Branham don't confess sin those
[28:16] spirits are gonna stay right where they
[28:18] are as long as there's unconfessed sin
[28:20] that's the main thing is wrote em said
[28:21] don't even get in the prayer line if you
[28:22] gotta get you have unconfessed sins you
[28:25] need to get rid of that first and then
[28:26] you can come in here because they're
[28:28] gonna stay there as long as as long as
[28:30] you don't confess but the main thing is
[28:32] confess God's Word and put out and
[28:35] confess whatever because you know the
[28:38] thing is is people say well I don't have
[28:40] any unconfessed sin but you there was a
[28:42] sister one time the lady come to brother
[28:44] Branham and she thought she was all
[28:46] right until brother Branham said y'all
[28:47] seen the railroad tracks in the car and
[28:49] everything like don't you mention that
[28:50] said I confess that a long time ago I
[28:53] was like yeah but you didn't confess it
[28:55] God wasn't the one you sinned against it
[28:57] was your husband you sinned against and
[28:58] you need to go make that right so you
[29:01] see a lot of times when those things
[29:03] come about all of a sudden people start
[29:05] to talking about things that they don't
[29:06] want to talk about because that's what
[29:08] that's what
[29:08] confess sins in your life as those
[29:10] things that are hidden then all of a
[29:12] sudden when the Holy Ghost comes you'll
[29:14] start bringing those things you remember
[29:15] it's what you need to make right and and
[29:19] the other thing is is to empower the
[29:21] people to be the one to cause the Spirit
[29:24] to flee you know it's not the ministers
[29:27] this like there was a brother I was
[29:29] talking to after the at the meeting and
[29:31] he said that brother Tim Pruett has
[29:33] instructed his ministers on this but the
[29:36] thing is as I was a sister came one time
[29:38] and she said the spirit they cast the
[29:41] demon out ever and it was you know she
[29:42] was so afraid it was gonna come back and
[29:45] they kept telling her sister we didn't
[29:47] cast it out you did and said the only
[29:49] thing that changes in all of this is
[29:51] your is your location you're here but
[29:55] when you go home
[29:56] God's Word don't change you've already
[29:58] cast him out so you had faith to show
[30:00] because gods are proved to you that this
[30:02] spear to leave you you have the faith
[30:04] God's Word don't change the Holy Ghost
[30:06] don't change the only thing that changes
[30:07] is your location
[30:09] because if he's done it once he'll do it
[30:11] again
[30:12] the only thing is you got to have faith
[30:14] to believe that he'll take care of that
[30:17] the other thing that I thought was
[30:19] amazing is the number of ministers a
[30:21] number of brethren that are around that
[30:23] have battled all these spirits that you
[30:25] can think of depression drugs alcohol
[30:28] even pornography that God has delivered
[30:30] and these brothers are the ones that
[30:33] come and pray for these young people
[30:36] it's so amazing because some of these
[30:38] kids say I battling this and I'm
[30:39] battling that and then brothers are
[30:41] standing there saying you know what God
[30:42] delivered me of that 13 15 20 years ago
[30:46] God delivered me of that and some of
[30:48] these brothers that have battled these
[30:50] spirits I have to tell you they're very
[30:52] zealous about what they do
[30:54] they're almost militant about what they
[30:57] do because they've been delivered of
[31:00] those spirits and those spirits still
[31:02] tacking to the young people they have a
[31:04] real burden on their heart for the young
[31:06] people and that's what amazed me was I
[31:09] was really blessed to see that because
[31:11] you know those kids are stand there
[31:13] sometimes they think they're there on
[31:15] the island all by yourself but you know
[31:18] what there's brothers standing there hey
[31:19] I've battled this I know what it's like
[31:22] and you know what God delivered me and
[31:25] you know what he's the testimony so it
[31:33] was it was really amazing and you know
[31:37] the one thing is is thing I want to say
[31:39] is fear is the way back is the devil is
[31:42] that the devil is looking for an avenue
[31:43] back in your life after the devil
[31:45] you cast a spirit out he's looking for a
[31:47] way back and fear is the way that he
[31:49] finds his way back because that's what
[31:51] some of those kids happen is because
[31:53] they get fearful after that thing leaves
[31:54] and the devil comes back well you know
[31:56] what if you start dwelling on fear and
[31:58] not dwelling on faith and that's the
[31:59] devil's Avenue to come back on here but
[32:04] I'm so glad that you know a lot of
[32:08] people have gotten to see those things
[32:10] that are real and they come upon us but
[32:13] you know what greater is He that's in us
[32:15] than he that's in the world Amen let's
[32:18] all stand this everything I'm sorry I
[32:20] didn't I was trying to be brief on this
[32:23] but it really it really touched my life
[32:26] and I thank God that the kids have a
[32:28] these young people have an opportunity
[32:30] and there's people out there that have a
[32:32] real burden for the young people to to
[32:34] be blessed and touched so let's sing

[34:35] not you
[34:35] then appreciate our youth would always
[34:47] be with them and learned a lot of things
[34:50] from these camps and things that they do
[34:53] too in this approach the Lord would
[34:55] always bless those that are trying to
[34:57] put forth those efforts to do those
[35:00] things to help the children and think in
[35:02] their doing they meant just remember a
[35:06] way of announcement wage is probably on
[35:09] the way back in this evening from
[35:10] brother Duchess so remember that
[35:12] remember brother Aaron will be
[35:14] ministering Wednesday remember the Bible
[35:17] study will be this coming Saturday the
[35:21] fellowship meeting will be the third
[35:23] Saturday in May so remember all of these
[35:26] keep in your hearts brother Addison
[35:28] still having trouble with his back and
[35:30] brother Donnie and he had been to the
[35:33] emergency room or to a doctor and then
[35:36] today they took him back so maybe we can
[35:38] have some rapport get something back
[35:41] after a while to find out how he's doing
[35:42] but he's been this a lot of diarrhea and
[35:45] this gets better and then it goes back
[35:47] and so you know he's lost us like I said
[35:50] 11 pound in three days or something like
[35:52] that so just you know prayer to the Lord
[35:54] would reach down and touch him and
[35:56] deliver him of all things like turning
[35:59] you scripture turned back where we read
[36:00] this morning from Ephesians 2 will try
[36:04] to pick up our thought and continue on
[36:06] on what we're talking on on salvation
[36:10] father we thank you for this day and
[36:13] your love thank you for everything thank
[36:16] you for being with the young people Lord
[36:18] and helping them and giving them
[36:20] understanding and Lord to see the
[36:22] natural things of life and a lot of the
[36:26] situations and it'll help them in their
[36:28] own spiritual understanding that they
[36:30] might walk in you and Lord we ask you to
[36:32] just bless each one remember brother did
[36:34] our Lord this back problem and brother
[36:37] Donny just reach down touch him and
[36:39] we're waiting them all the way back home
[36:41] remember all of these that are sick
[36:43] among us because we believe you and we
[36:45] thank you you said you sent your word
[36:47] and healed us and delivered us from
[36:50] destruction so just have your way now as
[36:52] we read your word you come and speak to
[36:55] our hearts and let your loving grace be
[36:57] with each one in Jesus name I mean
[37:02] Ephesians 2 beginning with verse 5 even
[37:11] when we were dead in sins hath quickened
[37:13] us together with Christ by grace you are
[37:17] saved and hath raised us up together and
[37:22] made us sit together in heavenly places
[37:24] in Christ Jesus that in the ages to come
[37:27] he might shew the exceeding riches of
[37:29] His grace in his kindness toward us
[37:33] through Jesus Christ for by grace now
[37:36] remember up here what we read where it
[37:38] says by grace you're saved now let for
[37:42] by grace are you saved through faith
[37:45] then he's brought his point he laid it
[37:48] down it were sitting in heavenly places
[37:50] and everything and that we were saved by
[37:54] grace but now he adds a point to it too
[37:57] for us to understand for by grace are
[38:00] you saved through faith and that not of
[38:03] yourselves it is the gift of God not of
[38:06] works lest any man should boast you may
[38:09] be seated the Lord and His blessing to
[38:12] the reading of the word now what was our
[38:14] point we tried to make the point this
[38:20] morning of one thing we say oh I'm saved
[38:25] I know I'm saved you can't tell me I
[38:28] ain't saved well oh why are you
[38:33] concerned about it right
[38:37] why are you concern what was the problem
[38:40] you know if you're saved who you're
[38:43] trying to convince yourself or me it
[38:47] doesn't do much good to try to convince
[38:49] me cuz it wouldn't have anything anyway
[38:51] but
[38:52] see our point was what we we do I
[38:56] believe the Christian thing is not just
[39:00] a one-time thing it happens and you
[39:04] believe in 90 years later you're still
[39:06] as I believer you know I believe that
[39:09] the Christian life is a life of faith
[39:13] it's a walk that is in a journey you
[39:19] know that in what we do and how we live
[39:22] and things that Christian journey is
[39:26] unfolding and we're walking day by day
[39:30] not just I said one thing we come to
[39:33] church and then never come back no more
[39:35] or never have no more anything you know
[39:38] we just
[39:38] well I'm saved and then when they die we
[39:41] put everybody in the heaven you know and
[39:43] say well they're saved well that might
[39:46] be true but what would you say from and
[39:49] how does it work
[39:50] all right so we're talking about and the
[39:53] title or thought will be for a couple of
[39:56] services on salvation all right and I
[40:02] like that part that I was mentioning he
[40:05] says that you're saved by faith but
[40:12] there's more to it than to just say
[40:13] saved by faith it's one he's not just
[40:16] saying my face in through faith through
[40:20] faith a journey but you're your
[40:25] Christian journey is what justification
[40:28] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[40:32] that's a journey how many of you
[40:35] remembers that journey we may have
[40:39] thought we were this or thought we were
[40:40] that but after coming into the truth of
[40:43] the hour see I look back and I remember
[40:46] my life and I remember when I started my
[40:50] Christian journey little Baptist Church
[40:53] you know and going forth and saying I
[40:56] accept Jesus Christ as my savior and
[40:58] then watching that unfold down through
[41:02] my life as I began to proceed on in
[41:06] my Christian journey and I begin to be a
[41:09] you know more concerned about my life
[41:13] about the way that I do in a hacked and
[41:16] the things and you know if I'm going to
[41:18] be a Christian I remember that that my
[41:20] thought was if I'm going to be a
[41:21] Christian I need to know what the Bible
[41:24] says because that should be the first
[41:26] thought you know so I set out to read
[41:29] the Bible and and to try to understand
[41:32] and I can remember it going through in
[41:35] my life and and that word that I began
[41:38] to read it began to take out a lot of my
[41:41] wrong calls and desires and points of
[41:45] life that I had you know doing and deeds
[41:48] and actions and and things like that and
[41:52] it just kept on will see the problem was
[41:54] that was as far as I could get dire
[41:56] because I didn't have anybody know more
[41:58] to Dyer to help you know move on because
[42:03] you know I would try to talk to people
[42:06] about salvation and they just kind of
[42:09] well I think you need to go to a to a
[42:12] Pentecostal church that's what one one
[42:14] Deacon told me one time you know
[42:16] and I think you need to go to
[42:18] Pentecostal church because in other
[42:20] words I talked about something he didn't
[42:22] know much about and he was encouraging
[42:24] me to go somewheres else come you know
[42:26] he was honest and sincere all right
[42:29] misty I didn't get the baptism of the
[42:31] Holy Ghost I come in this message but I
[42:33] thought I had it like all the rest I was
[42:36] thought and concerned I believe I had
[42:39] something I believe that brought me to
[42:42] where I was because I depended upon it
[42:45] but it wasn't over with all at once see
[42:49] even I was raised up in a church that
[42:52] through the badness that you get
[42:54] everything when you believe and I quote
[42:58] scripture where it said believeth and is
[43:01] baptized you know it wouldn't just
[43:04] believe to me it wouldn't just well I'm
[43:06] in the church I'm this I'm that or the
[43:08] other I had a desire in my heart to know
[43:11] more about God and then that desire I
[43:14] begin to call out to others and I found
[43:17] some who were interested in
[43:19] Okin and some that wouldn't but anyhow I
[43:23] believe I had something to direct me it
[43:26] may have been justification
[43:27] sanctification but it was salvation
[43:30] because that's what we look at we might
[43:32] we say you know well this that or the
[43:34] other and we try to to talk about our
[43:37] point of salvation
[43:39] let's see your salvation begins when you
[43:41] believe huh and that's that's what you
[43:46] ought to consider it and you're in a
[43:48] journey in your life day by day is a
[43:53] constant journey of a Christian life and
[43:56] it all should be done upon the basis of
[43:59] her faith all right now then what we
[44:03] were talking about this morning it was
[44:04] what now then that you're saved by grace
[44:10] through a journey of a Christian life
[44:16] saved by grace through faith
[44:19] all right now getting that part is to
[44:24] see that we we should never think about
[44:27] ever stopping it should never be the
[44:31] thought in a Christians mind or anything
[44:34] about stopping brother Brennan said Paul
[44:38] was the kind of person they wanted to
[44:41] always be moving he didn't mean moving
[44:44] and building from this place to that
[44:46] place or the moving in God to carry what
[44:50] he believed you know to others well that
[44:54] should be our desire we sit out of the
[44:56] desire in our heart to to you know want
[45:00] to walk in the word and let it unfold we
[45:06] know a lot about the world and in books
[45:08] and magazines and this better the other
[45:10] way but how much do we know of the Bible
[45:15] well see it's not the journey of a what
[45:23] you call it Webster's definitions or
[45:26] anything it's a journey of a Christian
[45:28] that we're talking about through faith
[45:33] through your life and you're doing can
[45:37] you remember that has your has your
[45:41] Christian understanding has your part of
[45:44] the world has it developed and I don't
[45:46] mean now just able to read I know I
[45:49] don't mean that now I know I don't mean
[45:52] see that's what most people think being
[45:54] a Christian is is to being able to
[45:55] memorize the Bible or what the people
[45:58] with photographic memories got it over
[46:00] us right this knots how much you know is
[46:05] how much has been revealed to you now
[46:08] that's what we got to deal with this
[46:09] afternoon so we're going to talk about
[46:11] faith all right
[46:13] how much of it has been revealed I would
[46:16] to God that I had revealed to me the
[46:21] amount of word that my mind has been
[46:26] able to capture me you know let it be in
[46:30] me and I want that desire I've always
[46:33] had a desire for growth you know a
[46:37] development in my Christian experience
[46:39] I've never satisfied I'm not satisfied
[46:43] now to to think about I've preached
[46:46] things that you know that a lot of
[46:49] people have never tried to preach but
[46:51] that's to me that's part of my Christian
[46:54] journey I want something real all right
[47:00] and see faith then is what Hebrews 11:1
[47:07] I'm is right faith is the substance of
[47:11] things hoped for the evidence of things
[47:15] not seen
[47:17] now have you ever been to where God
[47:20] reveal something to you I mean you know
[47:26] he might something known to you know
[47:31] when he reveals that to you it's
[47:34] something real it's the substance
[47:39] you can't show it as looking at some of
[47:43] the things brother Ron said you can't
[47:45] show your faith
[47:46] oh yes I showed my faith you ll alright
[47:50] so does everybody else
[47:53] you know you understand what I'm saying
[47:55] you can't show your faith you can't take
[47:57] it out and show it you can't show what's
[48:00] causing you to be what you are your life
[48:03] yeah up or down
[48:05] but people's lives are up and down you
[48:08] know people live a good life they're
[48:10] people in your neighborhood maybe you
[48:12] think they wouldn't in a lot of ways
[48:14] live a better life than we do more
[48:19] concerned and more you know of
[48:21] Christianity we had a lady that I
[48:24] remember in the Baptist Church that she
[48:27] said I won't make my bed in the morning
[48:29] if I could get an opportunity to go talk
[48:32] to somebody about the Lord
[48:35] well cc/minute she was sincere she was
[48:39] you know I don't have no problem of
[48:42] thinking she was just doing that to try
[48:44] to convince me I think she minute course
[48:46] she lived a good life you know one time
[48:49] and you remember a lot of people that
[48:51] you're around that live live good lives
[48:54] some that are not even Christian lives
[48:56] good lives and they're just you know
[48:59] everything I'm like brother Forney I
[49:02] don't like that Wow see Wow see down and
[49:05] out you know everything I have enough
[49:08] trouble as it is I don't have to get
[49:11] down and out about it I want to stay up
[49:14] and keep going because that's part of go
[49:17] that's part of my journey you know I've
[49:20] studied this message now for 50 years
[49:23] well I work to at least be able to
[49:26] remember a little of it right that's
[49:30] what you are I mean you studied it
[49:33] that's part of your experience is
[49:36] studying this message reading the
[49:39] message and taking it to see what God
[49:42] can reveal to you you know how that we
[49:45] do it a lot of times we say well I read
[49:47] that and studied that but city revealed
[49:50] it to me the other day well if you know
[49:52] what a revelation is and listen
[49:55] this is west way to say it you don't
[49:57] know what a revelation is if you never
[49:59] had one
[50:02] now that's the best way for me to say it
[50:04] if you've never had one you don't know
[50:08] what a revelation is if somebody can
[50:11] take away from you out argue out quote
[50:14] out do or whatever if they can take that
[50:18] away from you you don't even know
[50:21] revelation now a lot of the intellect
[50:24] might look good but if they can take it
[50:27] away from you that's not a revelation
[50:31] because we're talking about in the city
[50:33] Hebrews 11:1 that faith is the substance
[50:39] all right now here is our whole key to
[50:43] what we're talking about how my notes is
[50:45] doing no good I'll just leave them alone
[50:48] all right
[50:51] is your God real or is he just your
[51:01] thoughts is he just your imagination or
[51:05] your point or is he real well you say
[51:14] you believe in one true and living God
[51:15] right now is there any way that somebody
[51:21] could deprogram you and and take away
[51:25] from you the revelation of Jesus Christ
[51:28] if there is you didn't have it the I
[51:35] believe in a Salvation that is real
[51:39] because the God that I believe in is
[51:42] real didn't I can depend upon what he
[51:49] says because he's trying his best to get
[51:54] me to see something about that is real
[51:57] alright do you have know Satan can come
[52:04] and give us doubts and thoughts come on
[52:06] now listen he can make us this away that
[52:09] way down and out up and he can do all
[52:11] kind of things
[52:13] right when you think you got everything
[52:15] defeated you better realize you're
[52:17] fixing to get slapped down because it's
[52:20] not gonna work that way that's not God's
[52:22] Way of doing it oh I like what brother
[52:24] Gary Atkins used to say he said God
[52:28] knows how to raise children you know I
[52:32] mean we got it we got kids and we doing
[52:35] a pretty face that little eyeball you
[52:37] don't pee and this oh they cried and
[52:41] they just touch our heart right we'll
[52:48] see God don't deal like that you're
[52:52] heading the stage shut up
[52:54] sit down we're acting like a little baby
[52:57] oh my god don't do like that my guard is
[53:02] sweet and soft and mellow and well I'm
[53:07] sorry to tell you you ain't got the God
[53:09] I'm talking about you don't have the god
[53:12] of the word all right
[53:15] you may have your God but that's not the
[53:18] god of the word see sometimes they just
[53:21] tell you just shut up No quit crying get
[53:28] up home you know all right we get so
[53:31] down and out until we thank God has left
[53:35] us we're just in the valley of you know
[53:38] problems of the I think we have a sister
[53:41] no that's that's not a sister she's been
[53:43] here before
[53:44] okay I only look around and I miss
[53:47] people you don't I don't want to be to
[53:49] her that I don't see people yeah all
[53:51] right but now listen how real and the
[53:56] seriousness and what I'm talking about
[53:58] because I believe that your salvation is
[54:01] as real as your God now that's the way I
[54:04] believe salvation I believe it's just as
[54:08] real as God is called god is my
[54:10] salvation it's not just a thought or a
[54:15] concept that's what most people have
[54:21] about God they just have their own
[54:23] thoughts their own concept or on do
[54:26] about the eternal God what's not in it
[54:29] God is real I spent all of my old
[54:36] Christian but almost 40 years now trying
[54:38] to preach how real God is I make this
[54:42] statement now I love you to remember it
[54:44] when I make it I said one of these days
[54:46] I'm gonna preach on the Godhead if I
[54:48] ever get it settle down enough you said
[54:51] my lord you've been preaching 40 years
[54:53] on it that's what I mean I've been
[54:55] preaching 40 years old ain't got it done
[54:57] yet I'm just getting started I just see
[55:01] him unfold itself and how real he is and
[55:07] I know for a certainty that my salvation
[55:10] is based upon whether or not my God is
[55:14] real well I just you know I just believe
[55:20] these ain't just you know he's just as
[55:23] good he's this that they talk about that
[55:28] I'm talking about a god that has
[55:30] substance or is the substance a better
[55:34] way of saying it not a substance he's
[55:37] real he's more real than you are and I
[55:43] certainly know you're real well then my
[55:47] God is more real than anything I could
[55:49] think of all right God faith is the
[55:54] substance right now Webster says the
[56:01] substance is what anything consist off
[56:05] to be a substance it has to have some
[56:08] something that makes it better way if
[56:12] not it's just your thoughts all right
[56:16] yeah a substance can be walked on right
[56:25] well God is real now how real is your
[56:29] God then we get all down and out because
[56:36] things don't work our way
[56:43] but yet that's right where he won't
[56:47] society he said no no he wants me to be
[56:54] joyous and happy well why not be joyous
[56:57] and happy you mean you're down and out
[57:02] because God said something about quote
[57:04] Bert around he said if he asked God and
[57:07] he told him no he said oh no it's a
[57:09] better than anything else I could get
[57:11] something perforation if he tells you no
[57:15] that's more real and all the yeses
[57:17] you're asked for but then do you turn
[57:21] around and ask him again yeah but
[57:23] Lourdes you don't understand you don't
[57:26] understand my problems
[57:30] yeah we're trying to get him to come
[57:33] down on our ground being gonna do it
[57:36] yeah how is it by raising children
[57:41] sometimes you out spank them right
[57:45] because that may be against the law and
[57:47] immoral but that's I think got to do
[57:49] with it yeah you got to correct the
[57:54] child I didn't write the book God wrote
[58:02] the book he even said beat a child that
[58:05] won't die no if somebody come up to me
[58:09] and they had black all over them bruises
[58:11] and they said well daddy woman would I'd
[58:13] be the first one take you to jail so I'm
[58:15] not talking wrong right I just take you
[58:20] to jail cuz I don't believe in I don't
[58:22] believe that's what the Bible talking
[58:23] about well it said beater child ya know
[58:27] there's a lot of difference in a
[58:28] whipping and a beatin you know I
[58:33] remember white one time here he was
[58:37] gonna he got old enough you know and he
[58:41] was he wasn't gonna be a boy anymore
[58:44] you ain't gonna be a kid no more well I
[58:47] do worry about something
[58:48] well I tapped him a couple of times with
[58:52] a belt
[58:53] I noticed him he just border you know I
[58:58] said we gotta settle if one way or the
[59:01] other said God do something because he's
[59:06] done bowing up so I had a little belt I
[59:09] didn't kill him I didn't leave no big
[59:11] bruises or great big spots on him all I
[59:15] done was just kind of tapped him a
[59:17] little bit and that didn't work I tapped
[59:20] him a little bit again little R that
[59:22] didn't work I said one way or the other
[59:24] Kapow nah that's okay you through I
[59:28] didn't have to do the fourth one right
[59:32] why because you will call it breaking
[59:36] the spirit you wanna call it whatever
[59:37] you want to call it do it that's up to
[59:39] you you know as to what's doing that's
[59:42] uh you know we used to whip our children
[59:45] no I did more than I did but that's
[59:48] still the point you know but see if we
[59:50] we didn't pet him they was waiting
[59:53] Terrence was out in the yard one Hey I
[59:55] don't know where he'll remember that you
[59:57] know white was bigger than Terrence but
[59:59] they'd seen him down in the yard and
[1:00:01] they got into a fight well I just
[1:00:04] stepped out on the porch I say boys and
[1:00:07] though they were scrapland goods you
[1:00:08] know he wasn't either one killing each
[1:00:11] other and they was just and then I said
[1:00:15] come on up boys and they come up through
[1:00:18] that well both of them by then see they
[1:00:21] would live up daddy he jumped on me hey
[1:00:23] tup don't hate he done this he don't
[1:00:25] know and I didn't do it like I said come
[1:00:28] on Ian I saw the fight okay both of you
[1:00:32] lay with the bed you know just enough to
[1:00:36] let him know you don't you don't have to
[1:00:38] hit very hard
[1:00:39] I've always think about God as he
[1:00:43] corrects us with nail scars in his hands
[1:00:45] you know you don't never think of it
[1:00:47] that because that's justice the way God
[1:00:49] but he has to correct us my point God is
[1:00:53] real God is real he's not just the
[1:00:58] thoughts of your mind you're not
[1:01:02] something you could conjure up
[1:01:05] you know to make something he's real
[1:01:09] when are we going to realize that and
[1:01:11] just settle down to that and think about
[1:01:16] it and let him talk to us that way and
[1:01:18] deal with us as human beings faith is
[1:01:25] the substance of things hoped for now
[1:01:33] the best way I can describe it how many
[1:01:36] of you wants more of God you know how
[1:01:41] did you get more of God by faith right
[1:01:48] you want more watermelon what do you do
[1:01:53] you eat watermelon you want more faith
[1:01:58] just study the Word of God and it just
[1:02:05] keeps getting stronger and greater
[1:02:09] because he's real I'm trying to make a
[1:02:13] point
[1:02:13] emphasis you're saved by grace that's
[1:02:17] God's unmerited favor we didn't do
[1:02:20] anything to get it
[1:02:22] nothing we couldn't do it anyway it's
[1:02:25] all of what he done
[1:02:26] the Bible said if he didn't call us we
[1:02:29] can't be saved right well I just got
[1:02:33] saved I just went to the altar I just
[1:02:35] believe the Lord I'm saved now words the
[1:02:38] scripture for that my Bible says no man
[1:02:41] can come to God unless God calls you but
[1:02:46] it also got more to do with it then he
[1:02:48] says many are called and what you were
[1:02:52] chosen all right now let's see what is
[1:02:57] the depth of your faith like I said
[1:03:02] we've been in the message now some 40 50
[1:03:05] years we ought to have a at least an
[1:03:10] intellectual understanding right to be
[1:03:15] in the message and study one message
[1:03:18] all of those years we're not a bad dish
[1:03:21] that said well we spent 300 years and a
[1:03:23] Baptist
[1:03:23] you'll never grant gained one ounce I'm
[1:03:27] as serious as I can be I remember from
[1:03:30] where I started in the Baptist to where
[1:03:32] I left they had not gained 1 ounce upon
[1:03:34] Revelation now you tell me am i right
[1:03:39] thank back where you come from you know
[1:03:43] what I mean the church we was in it was
[1:03:49] known for getting rid of preachers and
[1:03:52] I've always on the wrong side you know
[1:03:55] where I was at I don't know preachers
[1:03:57] side and I was always in trouble because
[1:04:00] of that but we had one guy lasted three
[1:04:03] months because you have to be in the
[1:04:06] Baptist to understand the Deacon board
[1:04:09] runs the Baptist Church is not the
[1:04:11] pastor the Deacon board runs the Baptist
[1:04:14] Church and they told us said now what
[1:04:17] you do if that and I were mention it to
[1:04:21] one here while back knee is dialed life
[1:04:23] and he's a Baptist preacher and see they
[1:04:27] told us you're a deacon if that Baptist
[1:04:31] preacher gets off the faith you know the
[1:04:34] Baptist faith you're supposed to go up
[1:04:36] now that's my nephew and he verified
[1:04:38] that I was Rodney this is like they're
[1:04:42] supposed to go up you're supposed to
[1:04:43] take his Bible fold it up and dismiss
[1:04:46] the congregation and send him home
[1:04:50] because he's off the Baptist faith well
[1:04:55] would that be pretty good you know just
[1:04:59] because it he's off the faith he's in
[1:05:03] life he said well it you do have to be
[1:05:06] off the faith to do it
[1:05:08] see you think I tell a lot of things
[1:05:11] that are crazy you know what I told him
[1:05:14] in the Deacons meeting one night went on
[1:05:15] Deacon told me that I said come on
[1:05:18] fellas I mean brothers I said you had
[1:05:22] deacons in the book of Acts I said the
[1:05:25] only thing that they done was waited on
[1:05:27] tables
[1:05:29] my nephew life when I told him there
[1:05:32] because I did I said all that I know the
[1:05:34] Deacons to do is wait on tables and you
[1:05:37] telling me where to run this and run
[1:05:39] that so you don't think that a lot of
[1:05:42] things goes home unless you go out among
[1:05:44] it and learn it and then I say something
[1:05:48] like that to you well I don't know well
[1:05:50] that's true and I will go check it out
[1:05:52] I like brother dick Addison about that
[1:05:55] I'd say something we at least go check
[1:05:57] it out find out if it's true because you
[1:06:01] see what I'm getting at if you've been
[1:06:04] in a church for 10 years and you haven't
[1:06:07] grown in grace and knowledge there's
[1:06:09] something wrong with something wrong
[1:06:17] with you because your faith has stopped
[1:06:20] faith is a revelation it's a substance
[1:06:29] which is a revelation all right but it's
[1:06:34] the substance of things hoped for now
[1:06:37] listen now put brother Browns definition
[1:06:39] with it
[1:06:40] faith is the substance of things hoped
[1:06:43] for he said now you have it
[1:06:48] so now hope for much it look like it's
[1:06:52] something you're hoping you have and not
[1:06:55] true with salvation salvation is not
[1:06:58] based on hope now it is if you know what
[1:07:02] the word whole means because the word
[1:07:03] hope can be taken all the way into faith
[1:07:06] once the things we hope for all right
[1:07:10] see if you don't know the depth of the
[1:07:12] word hope your you'll be tying it up
[1:07:14] like I said you know we talked about
[1:07:15] believing the Bible doesn't say he that
[1:07:18] believes in his baptized he said he
[1:07:20] didn't believe it you stopped believing
[1:07:25] there's something wrongly you can lose
[1:07:27] your salvation yeah I will burn it out I
[1:07:30] don't understand that you think I can be
[1:07:33] saved today and lost tomorrow
[1:07:34] no I believe you can have a mental
[1:07:37] concept of salvation and think and hope
[1:07:41] that you're saved and believe that
[1:07:43] you're saved and Swire that you're safe
[1:07:45] and
[1:07:46] still be lost but I believe that well
[1:07:55] that's your evidence that's what the
[1:08:01] Prophet said what is the evidence that
[1:08:03] long ago whether or not the spirit in
[1:08:06] you now listen to agrees with the word
[1:08:13] not agreed whether it agrees with the
[1:08:20] word that's what I'm talking about a
[1:08:23] Christian journey through faith your
[1:08:28] Christian journey started today you
[1:08:32] accepted Jesus Christ as your Savior all
[1:08:35] right now if it stops anywhere there's
[1:08:39] something wrong how many of you can
[1:08:47] remember how the Lord brought you into
[1:08:49] the word can you remember that mr.
[1:08:56] Johnny can remember it real good because
[1:08:58] see her brother brother Doherty he was
[1:09:01] in this cult down in Lula Georgia she
[1:09:05] was up in New York and her brothers got
[1:09:10] all tied up in this stuff move she has
[1:09:14] come down here to go straighten us all
[1:09:17] out kind of like the story brother
[1:09:20] entails her other colleagues never ever
[1:09:23] each one it was about to Jehovah Witness
[1:09:26] but she came down here she wanted to see
[1:09:30] what brother Doherty had got into well
[1:09:37] you know what convinced her most of you
[1:09:40] know the story she here with us for a
[1:09:43] few days
[1:09:45] well no okay I kind of got their own
[1:09:48] whale singing they got their own well do
[1:09:50] it they got their a little bit of
[1:09:52] different what we are you know whatever
[1:09:54] it's okay don't know yet
[1:09:59] we'll see Anna she was I don't know
[1:10:05] maybe 10 years old 8 or 10 at that time
[1:10:07] something well sister Johnny was fixing
[1:10:10] to leave and Anna walked up to her and
[1:10:13] says come back sister Johnny and be with
[1:10:16] us said we love you you know thank you
[1:10:18] for coming
[1:10:18] you know what she went home there
[1:10:22] weren't all them great big revelations
[1:10:23] it wasn't all of them great big things
[1:10:26] we was doing she said grown folks can
[1:10:30] lie to you and tell you they love you
[1:10:34] when they don't but said kids don't do
[1:10:37] that so what was the thing that kept
[1:10:41] that brought salvation to sister Johnny
[1:10:44] in the basis of believing the message
[1:10:47] and coming on and now down here with us
[1:10:50] Anna in a little statement of we love
[1:10:53] you glad to come be with us did that put
[1:10:59] her in a Christian journey she used to
[1:11:04] call me from New York I know she kind of
[1:11:06] hot straightened out was all right she
[1:11:08] called me from New York we talked for an
[1:11:10] hour you know she said well there's one
[1:11:16] thing about it said everybody else down
[1:11:18] there they get to see you I don't get to
[1:11:19] see but said I'm talked to you and said
[1:11:23] look it don't cost me very much and it
[1:11:26] did get kind of funny because her
[1:11:29] husband he said her she started out in
[1:11:34] the basement with the washing and
[1:11:35] everything said now you've got that
[1:11:37] preacher up in the bedroom playing his
[1:11:39] tapes you know kind of make a part of
[1:11:44] the laugh she she had a Christian
[1:11:48] journey
[1:11:49] she moved along Laura it's just telling
[1:11:54] you so we think of every one of us could
[1:11:56] think about what happened in our journey
[1:11:59] that brought us to a place you know I'm
[1:12:04] talking about some of you like me too
[1:12:07] in my raise Danny let me talk about to
[1:12:09] you though I got for a decent memory
[1:12:12] really Larry he used to tell me this and
[1:12:15] that and they would always have to go to
[1:12:16] Ron's and eat so what I think tell you a
[1:12:21] little bit about her journey
[1:12:22] I go down to Ron's listen to him talk go
[1:12:26] brother Tom fought Bush we had two rides
[1:12:28] down that away you get all tied up a
[1:12:32] little bit about this out of the other I
[1:12:34] got a phone call about gooey breakfast
[1:12:37] so I got a broad breakfast you know but
[1:12:43] listen church how real is your God your
[1:12:49] salvation is based upon how real your
[1:12:51] God is if you don't have a real God then
[1:12:58] you need to find one I believe the devil
[1:13:02] that's more real to most people than God
[1:13:05] is because they don't know him as a
[1:13:07] person
[1:13:11] you realize salvation what are you
[1:13:13] saying brother
[1:13:14] you realize salvation is a person no I
[1:13:18] thought it's an experience I thought of
[1:13:20] something
[1:13:20] salvations a person I thought it was the
[1:13:27] revelation of Jesus Christ I thought
[1:13:29] that's what the prophets they Christ
[1:13:31] mystery of God revealed when he said
[1:13:34] what is the new birth then brother
[1:13:36] Branham he said it's the revelation of
[1:13:39] Jesus Christ personally to you now
[1:13:46] listen the new birth is a revelation of
[1:13:50] Jesus Christ
[1:13:51] to you not to brother branham no not
[1:13:58] going this saying it like it is it's not
[1:14:01] the brother branham to you right it's
[1:14:07] got to be something personal
[1:14:09] now how God send it that's up to him at
[1:14:12] that's I hope you understand my point
[1:14:15] it's not based on how much you know then
[1:14:19] we can claim to believe with the message
[1:14:23] let's come over
[1:14:25] you don't talk to me on a lot of things
[1:14:28] cuz you start saying well I believe the
[1:14:31] message well I'm gonna start saying
[1:14:33] where was you at last week when the
[1:14:38] Prophet said you can't wait for the
[1:14:41] church doors to open
[1:14:42] come on I can quote the Prophet you want
[1:14:45] to get with me on you know what I'm
[1:14:48] talking about you know the seriousness
[1:14:50] of the whole thing do we put everything
[1:14:54] we've got on what he says where we still
[1:14:58] got a little bit left over well I think
[1:15:01] it always gets me when I hear somebody
[1:15:04] we start to talking and they say brother
[1:15:06] they'll I think oh we got a road to go
[1:15:13] now we fix them to go down a rabbit
[1:15:16] trail cause you're saying I think right
[1:15:21] it ain't what I think it's what God says
[1:15:27] because see there's the point you think
[1:15:30] you're saved because you don't do this
[1:15:33] you don't do that you do this you think
[1:15:34] you're saved and God says that don't
[1:15:38] save you is that the way the Prophet
[1:15:41] said it does he say it that way I mean
[1:15:44] do I need to read them to you we try to
[1:15:49] make our salvation based upon our
[1:15:51] thoughts and ideas instead of what God
[1:15:53] says in his word
[1:16:01] saved by grace through faith we've been
[1:16:08] a little journey of a Christian walking
[1:16:15] can't you remember when things are
[1:16:17] revealed now this is this is one unsure
[1:16:20] that you won't never agree you know you
[1:16:22] probably never relate to it but have you
[1:16:24] ever noticed your Christian journey when
[1:16:26] you first start oh you're just so happy
[1:16:28] you're just traveling and you're just
[1:16:31] moving and every time as there's
[1:16:33] something new and then you just keep on
[1:16:36] reading and you
[1:16:37] and something new unfold something new
[1:16:39] unfold something new one folk night a
[1:16:41] while it starts getting to be less and
[1:16:46] less and less now am i right
[1:16:52] do you remember your Christian journey
[1:16:54] that way then when you first started you
[1:16:57] like a little baby
[1:16:58] God this gives you everything you cry
[1:17:01] for right a while you cry and he just I
[1:17:06] keep going on vacation he's training
[1:17:12] this God doing his brother Gary off boys
[1:17:18] in God don't want spoiled brats we used
[1:17:21] to get the tip of that if sister or some
[1:17:24] of you remember her three boys I think
[1:17:27] it was anyhow
[1:17:29] she had this more than a spoon or
[1:17:31] something wouldn't a paddle about this
[1:17:33] being a little Hickory or something and
[1:17:36] Bud one of them kids went to see Gopal
[1:17:38] and you could hear it you know but you
[1:17:41] didn't hear it no more that in today
[1:17:47] well Gary said she know that raised kids
[1:17:50] he'll see well in their awed that
[1:17:57] sometimes God has to use the rod of
[1:18:01] Correction no to get us the line up well
[1:18:09] no he's a loving God well I can say
[1:18:13] right real quick you lay on that real
[1:18:15] heavy with me you know what i'ma say you
[1:18:17] ain't saved oh you might not like that
[1:18:22] terminology but you're not saved
[1:18:25] cuz there's no such thing in my
[1:18:27] salvation to do I can't I've had him to
[1:18:35] tell me this I told you about it I
[1:18:38] was in trouble a little problem and
[1:18:40] things and I was praying not getting a
[1:18:42] car one day and I start that down the
[1:18:44] road and later Terence one met him I
[1:18:47] said they said where you going I said
[1:18:48] one for a ride and I was at one of them
[1:18:51] low points I was down and out wowsie
[1:18:54] wowsie who wouldn't even enough to get
[1:18:55] me started and I was just crying and oh
[1:19:00] man I was just driving down the road I'm
[1:19:02] just so upset and Lord everything's gone
[1:19:06] wrong
[1:19:09] think of a highway to my full and
[1:19:11] something said like this said hey you
[1:19:16] think you having problems
[1:19:20] what do you think I went through I cried
[1:19:27] all the way back home but it was a
[1:19:30] different cry you wouldn't no powdi
[1:19:34] thing it was a different cry
[1:19:36] he had just let me know that I was
[1:19:39] acting like a big old baby and I needed
[1:19:43] a good spanking then he just give it to
[1:19:46] me and I drove back home crying from a
[1:19:49] different cry a Christian journey sure
[1:19:55] we know about grace chilling talk about
[1:19:58] the unmerited favor but what about a
[1:20:01] journey in all of that what about a
[1:20:09] journey of faith what about walking in a
[1:20:18] realm with God that he's real
[1:20:24] now come on folks every one of the kids
[1:20:31] in tho here knows who Superman is you
[1:20:37] know who Batman is you know all about
[1:20:41] these things and who played the parts
[1:20:43] and who they were whatever right but do
[1:20:48] you know Jesus Christ how about it do we
[1:20:55] know Jesus Christ as being real
[1:21:02] you don't get nothing out of it on this
[1:21:03] island in a minute you just remember one
[1:21:06] time brother Dale believes in a real God
[1:21:08] I don't believe in just the thoughts
[1:21:13] from my imagination come on my
[1:21:16] imagination runs wild until he wouldn't
[1:21:18] even want to deal with my thoughts yet
[1:21:25] he's real if faith is the substance and
[1:21:31] we're saved by faith now come on do you
[1:21:37] agree with that is the Bible all right
[1:21:38] or do we need to read some more brother
[1:21:40] Branham or whatever do you believe
[1:21:41] you're saved by faith well no we'll say
[1:21:45] by through faith brother Dale you know
[1:21:48] we're saved by grace through faith all
[1:21:50] right are you really saved through faith
[1:21:52] are you going through a journey in your
[1:21:55] own Christian experience but nobody
[1:21:58] loves me I'm all down and out I'm a
[1:22:01] beginner enough wondering if the Lord
[1:22:03] loves me and talked to him in a while
[1:22:07] I thought we ain't I don't tell now you
[1:22:16] need that series the other day and ain't
[1:22:18] no bad for a preacher the way I am
[1:22:19] because I have more of a teacher style I
[1:22:21] can just drop back pick us up run that
[1:22:23] away while you're starting into a series
[1:22:27] it's all well and good and while you in
[1:22:29] the middle of the series are all well
[1:22:30] and good but when it starts winding down
[1:22:32] to end you get worried where am I going
[1:22:35] next but he's never failed me but he'll
[1:22:41] let me get so local I'm like I'm
[1:22:43] thanking Lord I'm over the cliff will
[1:22:46] you grab me cause he done I'm falling
[1:22:51] then he said okay go this way and he
[1:22:55] don't talk to me a lot I always he did
[1:23:00] but when he ever speaks I don't worry
[1:23:05] I don't worry about who don't agree with
[1:23:09] it
[1:23:11] and God speaks to me I have no thoughts
[1:23:14] about whether it's right or wrong I love
[1:23:19] thoughts about wondered which way I'm
[1:23:21] going
[1:23:21] yeah but not whether it's right or wrong
[1:23:24] I told you about it many times my wife
[1:23:28] was up in the garden one day and
[1:23:29] something's going on and I told my wife
[1:23:30] I said this will happen this away she
[1:23:34] said it'll never happen I said it either
[1:23:36] happen that away or I'll quit preaching
[1:23:38] she said you preached your life sermon
[1:23:41] well she was telling the truth as far as
[1:23:44] the natural was it's the only place
[1:23:47] there is where you've got something real
[1:23:52] see my you say well in the brother Dale
[1:23:55] I don't want to get on the spot of any
[1:23:56] hey I'm on the spot every service I
[1:24:00] claim to be speaking of what God has
[1:24:02] given me to brain and they got enough
[1:24:06] sense to know that if I don't bring it
[1:24:08] his way I'm gonna be condemned with it
[1:24:10] the very thing that I brain you know for
[1:24:15] sure I want to keep it right faith faith
[1:24:22] is not what you can remember faith is
[1:24:26] not how much you can memorize so that's
[1:24:30] what we think it is we think faith is a
[1:24:32] memory or to memorize something no it's
[1:24:37] a substance now listen
[1:24:42] do you realize this God speaking to you
[1:24:49] you realize that he gives you his
[1:24:51] thought he just gave you a part of his
[1:24:57] own substance part of his own being
[1:25:07] do you believe him that away faith is a
[1:25:17] revelation it's something God has
[1:25:23] revealed to you something he's revealed
[1:25:34] to you it's yours because he gave it to
[1:25:38] you and it's a substance it's like we've
[1:25:48] talked about you know a lot of things
[1:25:49] happening now and I was bitching doesn't
[1:25:52] want to go about it
[1:25:52] knit to somebody you know I mean if if
[1:25:57] we're gonna go this distance and fall
[1:25:59] apart and it goes to prove we didn't uh
[1:26:04] no salvation start with our salvation
[1:26:09] wasn't real it was a confession it was
[1:26:15] us accepting him but has he accepted you
[1:26:21] but brother Taylor you're not afraid of
[1:26:23] being on the Internet to the world no
[1:26:28] why should I be afraid about what I
[1:26:31] believe cuz of all they said this one
[1:26:37] point I mean remember this one I've
[1:26:39] always said it is what there's one thing
[1:26:41] see that I have in my favor if I'm wrong
[1:26:45] and you come correct me like take
[1:26:47] correction so I can't lose but if I'm
[1:26:53] right then ain't worried about you or
[1:26:58] anybody else well that's just being
[1:27:00] sarcastic
[1:27:01] well is it see
[1:27:08] followed this message long enough to
[1:27:09] know this message has no contradictions
[1:27:13] in it right now
[1:27:18] people make contradictions people make
[1:27:21] thoughts that are wrong little random
[1:27:24] said things that are wrong but the
[1:27:28] message has no contradictions what about
[1:27:36] a wonderful message that we talk like
[1:27:38] that the message is so perfect until
[1:27:43] there's no contradictions that it does
[1:27:46] not contradict in any way the written
[1:27:49] word of God because it is the written
[1:27:51] word made alive
[1:27:57] this to me is God in a letter phone okay
[1:28:06] now what this book says I believe and
[1:28:15] that's where when I preach I preach from
[1:28:17] this book the prophets message yeah
[1:28:23] because if you can see my Bible you'd
[1:28:27] see it he's got a lot of markings on it
[1:28:29] because all those markings is telling
[1:28:32] you what the Prophet said about these
[1:28:35] things all right now we get to this
[1:28:43] little thought later to show you how it
[1:28:45] work jesus said unless you're born to
[1:28:50] water in spirit you can't enter the
[1:28:53] kingdom water and spirit what do you
[1:28:59] think that means water and spirit well
[1:29:04] it means water baptism the Holy Ghost
[1:29:06] baptism that's a good thought but ain't
[1:29:09] true good thought good point but it
[1:29:17] ain't what he's talking about
[1:29:20] hmm so I searched and I searched go to
[1:29:23] No
[1:29:24] hey there's something wrong nah that
[1:29:26] doesn't compare with the rest of the
[1:29:28] world so I searched until I find where
[1:29:31] the Prophet said it you know what he
[1:29:33] said he said you're washed by the water
[1:29:38] of the word and then you get the baptism
[1:29:44] of the Holy Ghost so it is water and
[1:29:49] spirit see that way I depend upon what
[1:29:56] he's saying to me of what the word says
[1:30:00] because I know if I'm right and if it
[1:30:04] has been revealed to me then I have no
[1:30:07] worry about what's going to come forth
[1:30:14] you know I don't want to worry about
[1:30:16] what anybody else says well brother Li
[1:30:20] don't agree oh that's all right
[1:30:21] ain't no problem you show me what it
[1:30:25] says well I think it nars that thing you
[1:30:28] know I think it but what is your faith
[1:30:38] now let's say this for a minute and
[1:30:40] we'll quit see when you first accepted
[1:30:44] Jesus Christ that started your Christian
[1:30:46] journey right now we're gonna run
[1:30:50] through faith for a little bit we're
[1:30:52] gonna have a little journey through
[1:30:53] faith you started your Christian journey
[1:30:56] you started growing you started
[1:31:00] increasing in what in the memory of the
[1:31:06] word no no in the revelation
[1:31:15] and the revelation of the word you
[1:31:20] remember when you read the Bible you
[1:31:22] remember when you first started and then
[1:31:25] compare that to your understanding today
[1:31:27] and I didn't say had knowledge now
[1:31:29] because that's not right
[1:31:31] head knowledge ain't gonna save nothing
[1:31:33] that's our problem what about the
[1:31:36] Christian journey that started today us
[1:31:41] born again and it's been unfolding ever
[1:31:44] since I don't mean do you know more
[1:31:52] about the message by head knowledge I
[1:31:55] mean has the message become an anchor
[1:31:59] for the Soul
[1:32:05] yeah an anchor for the Soul is a
[1:32:07] substance you'll need having an anchor
[1:32:09] if you ain't got somewhere to put it in
[1:32:11] listener this is substance we're gonna
[1:32:15] pick up yes we're gonna get into
[1:32:17] justification and help for the children
[1:32:19] and the sanctification of baptism we'll
[1:32:22] all go but this is the main point right
[1:32:24] here to start it that you're saved by
[1:32:30] grace through faith and as long as that
[1:32:38] journey keeps unfolding you're saving is
[1:32:45] correct but if that journey stops you're
[1:32:51] proven you never had it
[1:32:59] yeah but you're making snow ain't liking
[1:33:02] it I'm making it anything but what
[1:33:04] you're saying but I thought you could
[1:33:06] eternal life you can't be lost if you
[1:33:08] get eternal life you can't be long I'm a
[1:33:14] firm believer in eternal security now
[1:33:20] listen listen you and I talk - I'm a
[1:33:22] firm believer in once saved always saved
[1:33:30] if you're truly saved if you're truly
[1:33:39] saved you'll never be lost but if you're
[1:33:45] not truly saved you're gonna be lost
[1:33:47] somewhere you're gonna go off somewhere
[1:33:51] to eternal security I'm a firm believer
[1:33:53] in eternal security once born again I
[1:33:59] always born again once born again not
[1:34:02] what we talked about not well I know I'd
[1:34:08] say bless God you can't tell me I ain't
[1:34:10] saved ain't tryin to ain't trying to
[1:34:17] tell you you're lost I'm trying to tell
[1:34:19] you you'll find out pretty quick what
[1:34:22] your Christian journey has turned out to
[1:34:25] be when this thing passes a few more
[1:34:30] turns of life and oh it's got to happen
[1:34:34] for something that's got to take place
[1:34:36] irregardless but when it does we're all
[1:34:44] gonna prove what we are
[1:34:52] but can you agree how many of these had
[1:34:55] to change your thoughts you know saying
[1:35:06] for a minute musicians come on oh how
[1:35:11] many of you used to be Trinitarians we
[1:35:15] swore by being regards didn't Lee right
[1:35:22] that's rude we swore by three guards
[1:35:27] what's the difference in I am
[1:35:30] we fired by one as your journey
[1:35:38] increased in Revelation or has it
[1:35:42] decreased because it is a travel journey
[1:35:54] you started as a child and you grow in
[1:35:58] grace and knowledge that's Baptist we
[1:36:04] started as a child and 20 years later
[1:36:06] we're still a child I see that in the
[1:36:11] message so much until I know I'm sorry
[1:36:15] I say things hard sometimes cuz I see
[1:36:18] that old thing that I used to watch back
[1:36:20] there the tur salvation never increased
[1:36:33] as yours increased what about it let
[1:36:42] stand well we got just remember one time
[1:36:52] salvation is a journey have you ever had
[1:37:02] the journey of justification
[1:37:04] sanctification the baptism when the Holy
[1:37:07] Ghost well brother though I didn't know
[1:37:11] I could well then you don't have it I
[1:37:17] can't remember what happened back there
[1:37:21] and where I came from you never had an
[1:37:28] experience that's that's what she falls
[1:37:32] back on these people think we'll all you
[1:37:35] got to do brother tell you you make
[1:37:37] salvation something hard to do when all
[1:37:40] you got to do just believe on the Lord
[1:37:41] Jesus Christ
[1:37:50] that's all you gonna do is you can
[1:37:52] accept Jesus Christ if it happens it
[1:38:01] happens if it don't we're not in the
[1:38:05] journey and you know what we proved when
[1:38:10] we are I think that's the end of the
[1:38:13] message
[1:38:13] don't drop the way back because that's
[1:38:17] the thought that came to me to start a
[1:38:19] new series you know the end of our
[1:38:22] journey will prove what we are and will
[1:38:27] look back and see where we come from and
[1:38:33] see that it's been a journey God has
[1:38:38] been leading us and guiding us you
[1:38:43] remember the story about the little boy
[1:38:45] you know walking behind his daddy in his
[1:38:48] footsteps let's just find our God and
[1:38:53] walk with Him there's not anything hard
