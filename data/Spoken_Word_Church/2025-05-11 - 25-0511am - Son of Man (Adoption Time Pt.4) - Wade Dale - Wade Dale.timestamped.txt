[0:00] We're just so thankful that we're free
[0:01] in the word, free in the spirit. Believe
[0:04] there's a scripture that says who the
[0:07] son sets free is free
[0:09] indeed. And where the spirit of the Lord
[0:11] is, there's liberty. Amen. Let's just
[0:14] sing that song of word of God ever
[0:19] true.
[0:22] Hallelujah. Just sing word of God ever
[0:24] true. As our brother comes out, it is
[0:27] true. It's true in every aspect. the
[0:30] true before the beginning was for he is
[0:34] truth and we're so thankful that we
[0:35] worship him in spirit and in truth.
[0:38] Amen. Holy
[0:41] words long
[0:44] preserved for our
[0:47] walk in this
[0:49] world may be sound with God's own heart.
[0:55] Oh, let the word of God
[1:00] impart. Words of life in words of hope.
[1:05] It gives us
[1:07] strength. It helps us
[1:10] go in this world. Wherever we roll, the
[1:16] word of God will guide us home. The word
[1:21] of
[1:23] God is
[1:25] true. Changing me is changing
[1:30] you. And we have come with open hearts.
[1:36] Oh land of
[1:38] [Music]
[1:40] work. Holy
[1:43] words of our faith is handed
[1:47] down to this age.
[1:51] came to us through
[1:55] sacrifice. Oh, heed the faithful work of
[2:00] Christ. Holy
[2:02] words long
[2:05] preserve for our
[2:07] wall in this
[2:10] world. They
[2:12] resound with God's own heart. Oh, let
[2:16] the word of God impart. Sing it to him.
[2:20] Word of God is ever
[2:24] true, changing
[2:27] me, changing
[2:29] you. We have come with open hearts. Oh,
[2:35] let the word of God
[2:39] impart. Amen. That's all that's worth
[2:41] anything is the word of God. Nothing
[2:44] else is worthy. And we put our
[2:46] dependency on that. If you would have
[2:47] your seats, we'll uh
[2:49] um make our announcements and and then
[2:53] uh wish our mothers a happy Mother's
[2:55] Day. And I'll uh I'll kind of read you a
[2:59] little something that uh that got out of
[3:02] scripture here that uh maybe we can read
[3:06] and and uh make some sense out of it.
[3:08] So, but we sure appreciate all of you
[3:10] praying for our trips. We were at um at
[3:13] the pastor's retreat. Uh had a wonderful
[3:16] time. It was just pastors and their
[3:18] wives and we got to u communicate with
[3:21] each other and and we we brought a lot
[3:24] back with us and we brought a lot of um
[3:26] a lot of new ideas and there was one
[3:29] thing we came out of the whole thing and
[3:31] um it was all uh here on Can you see
[3:35] this? All right, play
[3:38] it. See, this is the way that we think
[3:41] that um pastoring would be. This is just
[3:45] laying there and rubbing the sheep. And
[3:47] now watch this pretty little baby. Oh,
[3:49] look how sweet. But how being a pastor
[3:54] turned
[3:55] out somewhat different. Hold on a
[3:58] minute. We're not done
[4:00] yet. Hang on. The head deacon's fixing
[4:03] to get real
[4:07] mad. So that's what we took from that.
[4:09] God bless you. We love you with the love
[4:11] of the Lord.
[4:14] and just uh I pray I pray for the sheep.
[4:18] You pray for the shepherds won't get
[4:20] knocked down like that. So, but happy
[4:22] Mother's Day and we had really had a
[4:25] good time in Jamaica, too. That was that
[4:27] was a good trip and we got to be there
[4:28] with brother Keith in his 30th 30th year
[4:31] of ministering and uh or pastoring and
[4:34] uh we sure do appreciate brother Keith
[4:35] and Sister Francine. So, um so happy
[4:38] Mother's Day. I want to read this from
[4:41] proverb proverbs 31. And I'm going to
[4:43] make it bigger. I
[4:45] promise. So April can read it since
[4:48] she's getting older. Did I say that
[4:50] loud? Oh, my thing's on. Sorry. It's
[4:52] good to have Sister April with us today.
[4:55] Amen. That's um that's one of
[4:59] Charlotte's
[5:02] Yang. Proverbs says, "Who can find a
[5:04] virtuous woman for her price is far
[5:06] above rubies? The heart of her husband
[5:09] does safely trust in her so that that he
[5:12] shall have no need of
[5:14] spoil. She will do him good and not evil
[5:16] all the days of her life. She seeketh
[5:19] wool and flax and workketh willingly
[5:21] with her hands. You know, a sister can
[5:23] take a a pile of goods or a pile or
[5:25] buttons and and zippers and she can make
[5:28] kid dresses and she can make pants and
[5:30] she can make all kind of things for the
[5:32] guys. And mama used to make our suits
[5:34] for us a lot when we were growing up.
[5:36] But if you give that for me to do, we go
[5:38] to Walmart or we'd buy it somewhere else
[5:40] cuz we couldn't do that. So, you're
[5:42] special. She's like the merchant ship.
[5:44] She bringeth her food from afar. A
[5:47] sister can take all of her. She can put
[5:50] flour, this, and that, all together, and
[5:52] you look at it and you go, "Man, I don't
[5:53] know how this going to work." And then
[5:55] about 30 minutes later, she's whipped
[5:56] you into something that's good to eat.
[5:59] Amen. So, that's how good a sis a mother
[6:02] and a sister would be.
[6:04] She rides also while it is yet night and
[6:07] giveth meat to her household and a
[6:09] portion to her maidens. She considerth
[6:11] the field and buyth it. With the fruit
[6:13] of her hand, she planteth the vineyard.
[6:15] She girthth her loins with strength and
[6:17] strengthening strengthenth her arms. She
[6:20] perceive that her merchandise is good.
[6:23] Her candle goeth not out by night. She
[6:25] pays the bills.
[6:27] Praise the Lord. Anyhow,
[6:30] she keeps the lights on. She layeth her
[6:32] hands to the spindle, and her hands hold
[6:34] the daff. She stretched out her hand to
[6:36] the poor, yet she reached forth her hand
[6:38] to the needy. She's not afraid of the
[6:41] snow, for her household, for all her
[6:42] household are clothed with scarlet. She
[6:45] maketh herself coverings of tap
[6:47] tapestries. Her clothing is silk and
[6:49] purple. Her husband is known in the
[6:51] gates, when he sitth among the elders of
[6:53] the land. She maketh fine linen, and
[6:56] sellth it, and deliverth girdles upon
[6:57] the unto the merchants. Strength and
[7:00] honor are her clothing, and she shall
[7:01] rejoice in time to
[7:04] come. She openeth her mouth with wisdom,
[7:06] and her tongue is the law of kindness.
[7:09] She lookketh well to the ways of her
[7:11] household, and eateth not the bread of
[7:13] idleness. Her children arise up and call
[7:15] her blessed. Her husband also, and he
[7:18] praiseth her. Many daughters have done
[7:21] virtuously, but thou
[7:22] excelst them all. Favor is deceitful and
[7:26] beauty is vain, but a woman that fearth
[7:28] the Lord, she shall be praised. Give her
[7:31] the fruit of her hands, and let her own
[7:33] work praise
[7:34] her in the gates. Amen. That kind of
[7:38] covers everybody today. Uh when you get
[7:40] ready to leave, there'll be uh something
[7:42] for the sisters. Uh, some know some of
[7:44] you are not um don't have children, but
[7:47] that does not make you a mother
[7:50] because I see you work with kids that's
[7:54] not even yours. I see you nurture kids
[7:56] that's not even yours. So, you be
[7:58] thankful that you are a mother and
[8:00] you're taking care of the next
[8:03] generation that's coming. All right? The
[8:06] next generation. And and if you see me
[8:08] holding a baby, I like to hold babies,
[8:10] but sometimes I like to hold babies so
[8:12] the mama can have 5
[8:14] minutes to
[8:16] converse, go do something else, go to
[8:19] the bathroom, you know, give them that
[8:20] break sometime, you know, hang on, hold
[8:22] on to that kid and uh and sisters,
[8:26] you're
[8:28] all have a crown of your own that God is
[8:33] going to give you for being who you are.
[8:37] for being what? The virtuous bride of
[8:39] Jesus Christ. Amen. And that covers us
[8:42] too. In Galatians
[8:44] 4, let's read this just for a second and
[8:47] then we'll
[8:50] uh For it is written that Abraham had
[8:53] two sons. One by a bond handmmaid and
[8:55] the other by a free woman. Bond woman,
[8:57] other by free woman. But he that was of
[9:00] the bond woman was born after the flesh
[9:01] and he of the free woman was by promise.
[9:04] They're two children. Remember there was
[9:06] what? Jacob and Esau and you got all
[9:08] your twins all the way down through
[9:09] there. Then you got Isaac and the
[9:12] different ones. One Isaac and Ishmael.
[9:15] This is the one that Isaac was born by
[9:18] the the free woman and then the bond
[9:20] woman had they're over there fighting
[9:23] now you know. So which things are an
[9:26] allegory. So this is tight for those are
[9:29] the two covenants. One from Mount Si
[9:31] which genders bondage which is Hagar.
[9:33] For this Hagar, which means, you know,
[9:36] into the in the world, for this Hagar to
[9:38] Mount Si and Arabia and Arath, to
[9:41] Jerusalem, which now is in bond as in
[9:44] bondage with her children. But watch,
[9:46] but Jerusalem which is above is free,
[9:49] which is the mother of us all. All
[9:51] right. I was thinking, you know, back
[9:53] when when the garden before there was a
[9:56] fall, you sisters were not supposed to
[10:00] have husbands.
[10:04] Well, don't get quiet on
[10:06] me. It was Adam and Eve and they were
[10:09] going to produce the human race by what?
[10:12] By spoken word. All right. But Jerusalem
[10:15] which is above is free which is the
[10:17] mother of us all which is the source of
[10:21] something or the motherland. We get our
[10:23] nourishment. That's why they call it
[10:24] this mother earth because every bit of
[10:27] our nourishment comes from the earth.
[10:29] Well, every bit of our nourishment, had
[10:30] they not been a fall, would have come
[10:32] from the word of God, which was what?
[10:35] Already written in God's mind. He
[10:36] already had it wrote. I mean, so he was
[10:38] just going to speak it and we were going
[10:40] to come. But we know true now, though,
[10:41] that the full word of God is being
[10:44] manifest because he's a savior and a
[10:45] healer and redeemer. He does everything
[10:47] for He's got everything for us and it's
[10:49] there for us to use. So now we have a
[10:52] new mother. We have a new father. When
[10:55] you're born again, you have a new
[10:57] father, which is God. Right now we have
[10:59] a new mother which that mother nourishes
[11:01] us and keeps us and what keeps us in
[11:03] line and which is what? New Jerusalem
[11:06] are the word of God. All right. That's
[11:09] what we're we're born by the father. Now
[11:11] father everybody with me on everybody
[11:15] with me.
[11:17] Okay. He's the one that has a life. The
[11:21] mother has the nourishment. Right. So,
[11:23] that's what we're looking at now when we
[11:24] come to now to we we're going to start
[11:26] talking about adoption a little more.
[11:28] But still, we're covered under this
[11:31] covenant that there's a wild child and
[11:32] there's a there's a child that you which
[11:34] you used to be before you got born
[11:36] again. Amen. We were what? From Hagar.
[11:39] Amen. All right. Which is the wild
[11:41] child? Ishmael.
[11:43] But now, since we've been changed and
[11:46] changed over into a new family, that's
[11:48] why they call it a new birth. Cuz
[11:50] remember, your first birth put you in
[11:51] this family that you're in now. That
[11:53] you're going to honor your mother and
[11:54] you're going to honor them different
[11:55] ones all down through time. You've
[11:57] honored them because you came on this
[11:58] side. Amen. Everybody with me? That's
[12:01] good. That's all right. But that's not
[12:03] going to get you into eternity.
[12:06] Come on.
[12:08] You must move over to this new Jerusalem
[12:12] which is freedom and is from above which
[12:14] is the word of God. Amen. As the Bible
[12:17] says, which what? Which liveth and
[12:19] abideth it forever. All right. Sometimes
[12:21] our, you know, our mothers are not all
[12:23] here. And we sure do um pray for you. Um
[12:28] I still fortunate enough to have mine,
[12:30] but some of you do not. But make sure
[12:32] you give them a hug today and make sure
[12:34] you tell them how much you appreciate
[12:36] them. You say, "Well, my mother was
[12:37] this." I didn't ask you to give her a
[12:40] list of what things she did.
[12:43] I said, "You love her." Amen. Tell her
[12:45] how much you appreciate her. So, let's
[12:47] stand to our feet and we'll That was
[12:49] just for you mothers and we sure do
[12:51] appreciate you.
[12:53] You all have a gift. Your sisters have a
[12:55] gift in this church that is far and
[12:57] beyond anything that we can produce.
[13:00] Okay, everybody with me? So, we hold you
[13:03] of high esteem.

[14:20] like that, anybody wants to give anybody
[14:22] something, then that's fine with me.

[14:27] downstairs and we will honor our
[14:30] graduates. And the listen your life just
[14:35] begins when you start when you graduate
[14:37] in this world. All right. Now remember

[15:16] in the service. So, all minds clear.
[15:21] All minds clear. Amen. Might sound bad
[15:23] or it sound like some of them didn't
[15:24] have a very clear mind. Brother
[15:25] Collie, let's bow our heads. Lord, thank
[15:28] you for this day. Father, we have a a
[15:31] day called Mother's Day here on on
[15:33] earth. Lord, that we that we hug our
[15:36] natural mother and tell her how much we
[15:38] appreciate her, Lord. She brought us
[15:41] into this world, Father. And we pray,
[15:43] Lord, that we would now what we say
[15:45] today will be pleasing to you, Lord,
[15:47] because you brought us through this
[15:49] mother called the word of God. And
[15:51] you're nurturing us, Lord, and you're
[15:53] keeping us. and you're telling us how to
[15:54] do things and you're giving us you're
[15:56] giving us instruction as brother John
[15:58] said wisdom and all the different things
[16:00] comes from the mother of us all which is
[16:03] the word of God. Thank you so much,
[16:05] Father, for the ones that are here. Be
[16:06] with the ones that are out, Lord, that
[16:08] are sick. Uh, Sister Regina, Sister
[16:10] Janine, different ones, Lord. Ask you to
[16:13] bless them and raise them up. Be with
[16:15] the ones that are traveling, Lord. There
[16:16] are many not here today, Lord, is
[16:18] traveling to visit their mothers. We
[16:20] pray that you'd be with them. Bring them
[16:21] back home safe. Forgive us of our sins,
[16:23] Lord, and bless us in Jesus name. Amen.
[16:26] Amen. Just remember when your sisters
[16:28] when we get ready to take communion,
[16:29] when you go downstairs,
[16:32] um, Brother Ryan's got them in the bag
[16:35] and he'll give them to you as you go out
[16:37] the door going downstairs. A little
[16:39] token of our appreciation for our
[16:41] sisters that are old enough to be
[16:43] mothers. All right. So, now let's get it
[16:46] back to our subject, which is adoption
[16:49] time. And this is something that even
[16:51] when we were at the pastor's convention
[16:53] or pastor's retreat, we discussed
[16:57] several things about growth and
[16:59] development and how to and how to be a
[17:01] better Christian, how to be a more
[17:02] mature Christian. So that's kind of what
[17:04] we're on anyway. So this will be part
[17:07] four, but what we're going to do today
[17:08] is is we're going to see why we have to
[17:11] suffer.
[17:13] Why? The Bible tells us there's this
[17:15] we'll read scripture that we have to
[17:17] suffer to reign with him. Now, we don't
[17:20] have to be downtrodden. We don't have to
[17:22] be uh poor. You understand what I'm
[17:25] saying?
[17:27] But remember, the poor in heart will
[17:30] rule the world. The poor, the ones that
[17:33] bow. Listen to Hebrews 5. Though he were
[17:35] a son, yet learned he obedience by the
[17:37] things that he suffered. So if if Christ
[17:39] suffered, Amen. Why can't we? That's
[17:43] true. All right. And being made perfect,
[17:45] he became the author of eternal
[17:47] salvation unto all them that obey him. 2
[17:51] Timothy 2:8. And remember that Jesus
[17:54] Christ of the seed of David were raised
[17:55] from the dead according to my gospel,
[17:58] wherein I suffer trouble as an evildoer,
[18:00] even into bonds. But the word of God is
[18:03] not bound. Therefore, I endure all
[18:05] things for the elect's sake, that they
[18:07] may also obtain the salvation which is
[18:09] in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.
[18:12] It is a faithful saying. For if we be
[18:14] dead with him, we shall also live with
[18:16] him. If we suffer, we shall also reign
[18:19] with him. If we deny him, he also will
[18:23] deny us. If we believe not, yet he
[18:25] abideth faithful. He cannot deny
[18:29] himself. Amen. You may be seated. The
[18:32] Lord has blessed. He can't deny self. He
[18:33] can't deny the word that's already been
[18:35] written. He can't change his mind.
[18:38] He can't do anything different. So what
[18:41] do we have to do? The boundaries have
[18:43] been set. What you you and I have to do
[18:45] is is we have to be willing as Jesus was
[18:48] in the garden with his own will to say
[18:50] not my will but thy will be done. Amen.
[18:54] He came under subjection to the word of
[18:56] God. And the word of God brings us under
[18:58] subjection to what as I said before the
[19:00] mother of us all which is the word of
[19:03] God. Because listen that's where we get
[19:04] our nourishment. Even though you listen
[19:06] to a pastor, you listen to an
[19:07] evangelist, you listen to brother
[19:09] Brandham, he's preaching from the Bible.
[19:11] Yes. Okay. He's getting his nourishment
[19:15] from the Bible. And then he's able by a
[19:17] gift to break it down to you so that you
[19:20] can understand the Bible. I don't want
[19:22] you to understand me. It'll be a
[19:25] while. That's June. 46 years almost
[19:29] trying to understand me. But understand
[19:31] what I say from the word of God is what
[19:35] I want you to do. And we're Listen, this
[19:38] is adoption time. This is the time for
[19:40] it. Um, listen, I have been My phone's
[19:44] been blowing up all week about this new
[19:46] pope. They've got everything figured
[19:49] out. It was diaper size and all that
[19:50] other stuff back when he was a kid. I
[19:53] That's all right, but that's not going
[19:55] to get us in a rapture. Amen.
[19:58] Now, remember, we do have signpost.
[20:02] We have signs. We would have a bad wreck
[20:05] if we didn't have signs on that road.
[20:07] But the signs itself do not get me to
[20:10] where I'm going. Amen. The signs, it
[20:13] tells you to stop. It tells you to go in
[20:15] this direction. But you have to have the
[20:18] vehicle. Amen. And be in that vehicle.
[20:22] And then you look at those signs and
[20:24] you're able to turn a corner or speed up
[20:28] or slow down. So that's the way the word
[20:30] of God is to me. Uh, brother Dale said
[20:32] many, many years ago, many years ago, he
[20:34] talked about the pope coming out of the
[20:35] United States many, many times, if
[20:36] you'll remember, years and years. But
[20:39] remember what he told you. He said
[20:40] that's not going to get us in the
[20:41] rapture.
[20:42] It is going to make us diligent to seek
[20:45] God more. And I do see we I was this
[20:49] morning I was uh looking at an article
[20:51] from YouTube and uh the article was it
[20:54] come from people people bet on
[20:57] everything.
[21:00] There was a line in Vegas about who was
[21:01] going to be the next pope. Well, Pope
[21:04] Francis or this who this new one is had
[21:07] a
[21:08] 1.2% chance to be the pope. 1.2.
[21:14] Yes. Some of the others were 50%, 30%,
[21:18] 40%.
[21:21] 1.2%. It shocked the world. And I'm
[21:24] telling you, Mother Earth,
[21:28] Mother Earth declared it yesterday.
[21:35] That were in Tennessee.
[21:38] See, earthquakes in divers places, many
[21:41] places, not just We're looking at
[21:43] California. Do you know one of the
[21:44] biggest faults is on the Mississippi
[21:46] River? Yes. It's a something New Madrid
[21:49] or something like that fault. Look it
[21:50] up. It's on It's online, Sister April.
[21:54] It's online. It's got to be true.
[21:57] So, but he had a 1.2% chance. And then
[22:02] boom, he wasn't even in the top five the
[22:05] day before.
[22:07] So, don't you think God's got his hand
[22:09] in this? Now, the most powerful man in
[22:11] the world has now got the most powerful
[22:14] religious man in the world. I'm talking
[22:16] about Trump and and him. You got two.
[22:19] That's why they never wanted a a pope to
[22:21] come out of the United States. The world
[22:23] does. They're shocked because you got a
[22:25] you got a a a power of the US that power
[22:28] has a economic power and well, it's all
[22:31] propped up. We know that. But then you
[22:33] got now you surely they didn't want a
[22:35] Catholic to be out of the United States
[22:37] because you put them two together.
[22:38] That's right. And he came from he came
[22:40] from Chicago. Chicago was cursed.
[22:46] The prophet cursed him. Told him all
[22:48] them ministers were going to come and
[22:49] get baptized. Not a one came, right?
[22:52] Made it a desolate place. But anyway,
[22:53] you can go all through this. And they
[22:54] went through this stuff. And I it's
[22:56] okay. But I started to chime in on our
[22:59] little thing from from on WhatsApp for
[23:01] the pastors. I said, "Are y'all gonna
[23:03] preach on Mother's Day tomorrow or you
[23:04] gonna preach on this?" Because I'm sure
[23:07] that everybody took a text about the new
[23:09] pope. We knew this, folks.
[23:12] He quoted it in 1955,
[23:15] the year that that pope was born. And
[23:17] he's 69 years old. He's young, so he can
[23:21] last a little bit longer than the rest
[23:23] of them. Yeah. Like right into the
[23:26] tribulation.
[23:30] If he's the right one, then we looked
[23:32] the other day. You looked right into the
[23:33] face of the Antichrist.
[23:37] Republican and Democrat ain't the
[23:39] antichrist. The Antichrist is a
[23:41] religious spirit.
[23:43] That uses political power. Amen. Which
[23:46] we have it now. Church and state have
[23:49] come together.
[23:51] So there's your signpost. But you better
[23:53] get in that vehicle and you don't stay
[23:54] at that stop sign too long. You better
[23:56] keep going.
[23:58] Search the word of God for yourself. You
[24:00] need to get in or get out. One of the
[24:02] two. Because when Noah come up to that
[24:04] ark, I'm telling you again, God shut the
[24:06] door. I believe Noah did not want to
[24:08] shut that door. And God knew,
[24:11] God knew that Noah would never himself
[24:14] shut that door. Cuz when that door shut,
[24:16] Noah knew everybody on the outside was
[24:18] dead. But God didn't have a problem do
[24:20] it because 120 years it took him to
[24:22] preach that and only him and his family
[24:24] made it. So that's it. That's all right.
[24:28] Let's continue on. But you just, you
[24:30] know, you can get immersed in all this
[24:32] stuff. You talk about this and talk
[24:34] about that, but let's just get in the
[24:36] word of God and let the word of God lead
[24:38] us and guide us. Let's get in the right
[24:39] vehicle, get on the right road. As
[24:41] brother Dale always said, if you're
[24:42] going to take an airplane trip, what do
[24:44] you got to do? You got to be at the
[24:46] airplane. You got to go to the terminal.
[24:48] You got to buy a ticket from there.
[24:49] That's right. You can't buy a bus ticket
[24:51] and then go down to the airport and tell
[24:52] them you need to get on. No, it ain't
[24:54] going to happen. I believe we're in the
[24:57] right message. Amen. I believe this is
[24:59] it. There is no other. There's too many
[25:02] scruples in all those others. And that's
[25:04] what we're going to see here in just a
[25:05] minute. That's why brother Brown will
[25:07] talk about suffering. You talk about
[25:09] suffering. We would still be suffering
[25:12] under the denomination that we were
[25:13] caught up in. Everybody with me? Oh yes.
[25:16] You would be suffering because you would
[25:17] be like over here with this. Is this one
[25:19] right? Is that one right? Listen, we
[25:20] know what's right. Amen. We've had the
[25:22] quotes. We know where it was coming
[25:24] from. We know the United States is
[25:26] Revelation 13. We know that he's not the
[25:28] beast, but he is what? He's the voice or
[25:30] the power behind the beast. We know the
[25:33] beast is the pope. So now you've got
[25:36] both of those powers back together like
[25:37] Constantine put those together. And what
[25:39] happened when Constantine brought church
[25:41] and state together, had a pope,
[25:44] Constantine put them together and they
[25:46] killed 68 million Christians because
[25:49] they didn't believe the Catholic Church.
[25:51] Right? We got some times coming. It's
[25:54] exciting if you're in the word of God.
[25:55] It's not very exciting if you're not
[25:58] Smyrna church age. Why does he stand by?
[26:00] The reason is Romans
[26:02] 8:17. If children then hes of God and
[26:05] joint hes with Christ. If so be that we
[26:08] suffer with him. Now let's look just for
[26:10] a second before we get finished reading
[26:12] that. Good brother Ram said, "Unless we
[26:14] suffer with him, we can't reign with
[26:16] him. And character is a victory, not a
[26:18] gift." We know that man without
[26:19] character can't reign because power
[26:20] apart from character is satanic. Now
[26:22] what you talking about suffering? Why
[26:24] must we suffer? Suffering is not
[26:27] suffrage.
[26:29] Everybody with me? That's right.
[26:32] Suffrage was what the black people went
[26:35] through. Different ones. They were
[26:37] persecuted.
[26:38] That's not what this is talking about.
[26:40] Right. Am I with me? Now, eventually you
[26:44] may have to give your life for the
[26:45] gospel. Eventually you might have to.
[26:48] But suffering means I don't go to the
[26:50] bar. I don't go to
[26:53] the put whatever you got in that. You
[26:55] say, "Oh, that's if you're a Christian."
[26:57] No, but that's something that inside of
[26:59] you. And we were talking about this last
[27:01] week. You still got that nature inside
[27:04] of you folks that want to do those
[27:05] things. Everybody with me? For those of
[27:07] you that are sainting, you can go on
[27:09] home cuz you don't need this sermon.
[27:14] If you're not bothered, you're dead.
[27:18] Come on.
[27:19] There's always that thing right here.
[27:21] There's always that something that's
[27:23] saying you really enjoyed that used to,
[27:27] right? But the suffering part is is to
[27:30] to pull yourself away from this nature
[27:32] that you have inside of you. That
[27:34] greatest battle is inside of your brain
[27:38] and let that good part go to your heart
[27:40] because you used to not let that good
[27:42] part go to your heart. You used to let
[27:44] the bad part go to your heart cuz your
[27:45] heart wanted to do it. Out of the heart
[27:47] proceedth what? all things. Yes. All
[27:50] right. Not up here out of your heart.
[27:52] Right. But if we suffer, we'll reign
[27:55] with him. Suffering is
[27:57] not You
[27:59] see, let me just put it plain. The
[28:02] Catholic Church took that script, took
[28:04] these scriptures because remember they
[28:05] owned the scriptures. They held all the
[28:08] scriptures. All the scrolls, everything
[28:09] was in Latin. Everything was that come
[28:12] from the Latin Vulgate with the Roman
[28:13] Catholic Church. God, that's kind of
[28:15] strange. It's not really to God. But he
[28:17] preserved this whole thing through the
[28:19] Roman Catholic Church, right? But
[28:22] they're saying you need to do penance.
[28:23] You need to get on the, you know, you
[28:25] need to crawl on your knees or you need
[28:26] to slap yourself. That's what they're
[28:28] saying. They're taking that as
[28:31] suffering.
[28:33] suffering for Christ, being hung on the
[28:35] cross or or or being flailed or or you
[28:38] know, they I I used to get tickled at
[28:41] some of the people that work for us
[28:42] there at J&G and and a couple of them
[28:46] were Catholic
[28:48] and it would be lent. Everybody know
[28:50] what Lent is? Lent is you give up
[28:52] something that you enjoy.
[28:55] That's right. Well, I asked him, I said,
[28:57] "What are you giving up?" They said,
[28:58] "We're giving up like tomato juice."
[29:02] I said, 'You never liked tomato juice to
[29:04] start with?' Yeah, but I'm giving it up.
[29:06] Well, that ain't that ain't suffering.
[29:08] You got to give up something you really
[29:10] like. That's suffering. Now, folks, your
[29:12] body really like to do the things of the
[29:14] world. Come on, somebody. But you have
[29:17] been separated by the thing that now the
[29:19] new birth and the word of God, which
[29:21] gives us our spiritual rudder that tells
[29:23] us which way to move. We didn't have
[29:26] that. We didn't have a we a we don't
[29:28] even have morality anymore.
[29:31] This next generation of kids, if there
[29:32] is another generation, brother brother
[29:35] Kern, everything's accepted now. There's
[29:37] no boundaries.
[29:40] Every every generation weaker and wiser,
[29:43] they're putting up with Do you know in
[29:46] 1965 that homosexuality was considered a
[29:50] disease, right? Right. In the book, the
[29:56] AMA or the American Medical Association,
[29:58] being
[30:00] homosexual was a
[30:03] disease. Now, pretty much if you're not
[30:05] one, it's a disease.
[30:08] We're strange. But the world, that's the
[30:10] way the world has twisted this whole
[30:11] thing. Made everything okay. It's all
[30:14] right. God made you male and female, but
[30:16] you can override God and make yourself
[30:18] whatever you want. Right.
[30:21] I'm just going to preach today. This is
[30:23] where we're sitting today. This is why
[30:25] we need to teach our kids to refrain
[30:28] from all that stuff. Make sure they
[30:30] understand what they're looking at and
[30:32] listening to and all those different
[30:33] things. Make sure that you've got that
[30:35] Holy Ghost veil on you first so that you
[30:38] can cover them with and keep them away
[30:40] from that stuff.
[30:43] Amen. Unless we suffer with him, we
[30:45] cannot reign. We have to suffer to
[30:48] reign. So what is suffering? You know
[30:50] what suffering is? Suffering is you go
[30:53] read your Bible for an hour instead of
[30:55] going to a ball game. I ain't got
[30:57] anything against ball games. Okay. But
[30:59] what I'm saying is is like brother Dell
[31:02] always told us. He said, "You might
[31:03] y'all might go out and go hunting or
[31:04] y'all might go fishing or all that
[31:06] stuff." He said, "I'm sitting at home
[31:07] studying on Saturday so I can get you a
[31:10] sermon for Sunday." And then there's not
[31:12] many Sundays that you know, Dad took a
[31:14] couple of Sundays off maybe a year and I
[31:16] do too, to go hunting. It's my vacation
[31:18] time.
[31:20] Amen. All right. But not every other
[31:22] Sunday.
[31:24] Like some here. They come when they want
[31:26] to. You know
[31:28] why? You know why? They don't want to
[31:31] suffer.
[31:32] They don't want to suffer.
[31:35] No. They want to do something else.
[31:38] Because that something else is stronger
[31:40] inside of them than what God is. Amen.
[31:44] That's right.
[31:45] I'm telling you, we we keep quoting that
[31:47] quote. We keep quoting brother Brown
[31:49] said, "If you're a Christian,
[31:51] if you're born again, you can't wait for
[31:54] them doors to open to get into
[31:57] fellowship with God."
[31:59] That's right. And we stay out because
[32:01] your cat's got diarrhea and you, you
[32:03] know, your your little baby frog that
[32:05] you picked up off the side of the road,
[32:06] it just don't look good today, Brother
[32:07] John. It it's it's not very it's not
[32:09] very slick. So, we going to stay home
[32:11] with it. and you'll take somebody to
[32:14] pray for it.
[32:19] A man without character can't reign
[32:20] because power apart from character
[32:22] satanic. Listen, you and I have the
[32:24] power of God when you're born again.
[32:25] Brother Ram said there's enough inside
[32:26] of you to do what? Create a world and go
[32:30] live on it. But there's a bar. What's
[32:33] that bar? This is your bar.
[32:35] This is your bar. Because that dynamo
[32:37] that's inside of you, we keep it so uh a
[32:41] prisoner inside of us and we let it out
[32:44] just every once in a while. That's what
[32:46] we were talking at the pastor
[32:47] convention. We only live maybe, listen
[32:50] to me, we maybe only live 20% of our
[32:52] life for God.
[32:56] You think about it. You sleep half of it
[33:01] here and at
[33:04] home. you have to go to work. Sure, you
[33:06] can think about God, but I'm talking
[33:08] about alone time.
[33:11] I'm talking about time that you spend
[33:12] and know that it's quality time to talk
[33:16] to God and not to talk to somebody else.
[33:18] That's why I said if you need to know
[33:20] where God is, he comes here every
[33:22] morning at
[33:24] 10:00, 9:30
[33:27] and you can come and talk to him. You
[33:29] can come visit him. He's right here.
[33:31] He's with us. He said where two or three
[33:32] are gathered by name. He didn't say a
[33:34] whole group. He said, "Two or three are
[33:36] gathering my name." He said, "I'll be in
[33:37] your midst." So today, God is in our
[33:39] midst. I in Jamaica, I told him, I said,
[33:42] "Man, there's Listen, there's more in
[33:44] another dimension that's praising God
[33:46] and standing here today around these
[33:48] walls than people that I can see right
[33:50] now." Yes, sir.
[33:53] The good and the bad.
[33:56] Because the evil is present. Remember
[33:57] what Paul said. He said, "When I do
[33:59] good,
[34:00] evil is present." Now, that doesn't mean
[34:03] I do evil, right? No, I'm going to
[34:06] suffer. You and I are going to have to
[34:08] suffer. But power apart from character
[34:11] satanic. That's what Satan had. Satan
[34:14] had power, right?
[34:19] God told him, "You do this. You're my
[34:21] worship angel. You take over the angel
[34:23] part and you stay right there." But what
[34:25] did he want to do? He wanted to be God.
[34:28] He wanted to get out of his place and be
[34:30] God. He wasn't satisfied with where he
[34:32] was at.
[34:34] You and I must remember too that we've
[34:36] got to be when we come to this adoption,
[34:38] you've got to be satisfied with who you
[34:40] are, what you're doing here. Amen. Come
[34:43] on. And what part you got to play in
[34:45] this body. Yes. It may only be a hand.
[34:48] It may only be a foot. That's right. But
[34:51] remember, it's a part of the body. And
[34:53] we hurt when that part hurts.
[34:56] Hit yourself. hit yourself on the hand
[34:58] with a ham finger with a hammer, your
[35:00] whole body hurts. Oh yes, right. So
[35:03] power, we're trying to build character
[35:06] first. We got to we got the power. We
[35:09] know that if you're born again, you got
[35:10] the power, but the character to use that
[35:13] power is this adoption process. That's
[35:16] what we're talking about here. Cuz what
[35:18] happened with Jesus? Now remember, he
[35:20] was born in a womb. He had to eat. He
[35:22] pooped.
[35:24] Sorry, he did. He was a human being.
[35:28] But he was perfect. Yes.
[35:31] Tempted by women but never crossed a
[35:33] line.
[35:35] Bible says tempted in all points as you
[35:38] are. Yes. Yet he didn't cross that line.
[35:40] What? He suffered, right? He suffered to
[35:43] reign. He knew that he was going to take
[35:45] it over. He knew though that he was
[35:47] going to have to go through some very
[35:49] horrible things cuz he remember he knew
[35:51] he had to die physically to release the
[35:55] life that was inside of him. That was
[35:57] the groaning in John 17. He said,
[35:59] "Father, don't take them out of this
[36:00] world." He said, "Leave them in the
[36:02] world." He said, "But protect them."
[36:03] Yes. That's what he's done. It would be
[36:06] real easy for us to, Brother Boy, it'd
[36:08] be real easy for me and you to go create
[36:09] a world and just go live on it, man.
[36:11] got, you know, you got grapes and you
[36:13] got palms, you know, and you got, you
[36:14] know, it's the right temperature all the
[36:16] time. And no,
[36:18] we'll get there. Yes. But you're human
[36:21] now, right? There's human parts. We got
[36:24] to work on the character that we are
[36:26] going to develop will, as brother Ernie
[36:29] said, it will determine our altitude.
[36:31] Come on. Remember, brother Ernie said
[36:34] our our attitude determines our
[36:36] altitude. All right. So if you want to
[36:38] grow in God and be a a a good Christian,
[36:41] that's
[36:42] fine. But God wants more. Yes. This is
[36:46] what God's whole purpose of adoption is.
[36:50] Is to be able to use you. Yes. And know
[36:53] what you'll do with it when you get it.
[36:57] Everybody with me today?
[37:00] Know what to do with it when he gives it
[37:02] to you. Yes. Because power without
[37:04] character is satanic. power with
[37:07] character is fit to rule. Amen. So Jesus
[37:10] Christ had the character. He portrayed
[37:13] the character in every in every part of
[37:16] the testament old and new. And he gave
[37:19] us this. He gave us a prophet in the end
[37:21] time to say, "Hey, these things are
[37:22] required." Yes. They're not just happy
[37:25] to be and and maybe um No, they're
[37:27] required. Yes, sir. It's required to
[37:30] have the faith of God. Yes. It's
[37:32] required to have the knowledge of God.
[37:33] Right. The temperance of God, the
[37:35] patience of God. Yes. Yes. The godliness
[37:37] of God. Come on. Everybody with me?
[37:42] We have to overcome to sit with him. He
[37:45] wants us to share his throne. Listen, he
[37:47] so much wants us to sit with him.
[37:53] You know
[37:54] Jesus, brother Carlos, Jesus had a set
[37:58] of natural eyes
[38:00] that he looked through. All right, let's
[38:02] go back 2,000 years. Jesus is walking
[38:03] the walk on the earth. He's got two eyes
[38:06] just like me and you. They're human
[38:08] flesh eyes, right?
[38:11] He never saw his bride
[38:13] develop. He never saw her develop. Am I
[38:16] with me? Cuz remember, he said, "I must
[38:19] go away, but I'm going to come back as
[38:21] the comforter. I'm not coming back in my
[38:24] human my flesh eyes. I'm not going to be
[38:28] able to see you." Right. Right.
[38:31] He said, "But I will be with you even in
[38:33] you. You're going to be my body. You're
[38:36] going to be my eyes.
[38:38] But I think, brother Dy, he is longing
[38:41] to see his bride face to face. Just like
[38:45] he did in the Garden of Eden when he
[38:46] walked up to Adam and there was a set of
[38:48] human eyes looking at a set of human
[38:50] eyes and saying, "Oh, that's my
[38:52] children. That's my people." Amen. He's
[38:55] wanting to see his bride. Yes. With his
[38:57] own eyes. Absolutely.
[39:02] I just believe that it's taken 2,000
[39:04] years how patient a man is to wait on
[39:05] his wife to develop
[39:09] into a wife. Amen. Because the wife has
[39:12] made herself ready.
[39:14] Why do we have to suffer? Let's go to
[39:17] first Peter 2 verse 18. Servants, be
[39:20] subject to your masters with all fear,
[39:23] not only to the good and gentle. Now
[39:24] watch. Not only to the good and gentle,
[39:26] but also to the forward. Be nice to your
[39:29] boss even though he's not nice to you.
[39:31] All right. Or she.
[39:34] Well, I got some amens.
[39:39] For this is thankw worthy. Now, this is
[39:41] Peter, the one that told us to have the
[39:43] virtue of God, the knowledge of God, the
[39:44] temperance of God. For this is
[39:46] thankworthy. If a man for conscience
[39:49] toward God endure grief, suffering
[39:52] wrongfully. All right. Jesus suffered
[39:54] wrongfully. He did not have to go
[39:56] through what he went through. That's
[39:57] right. He had no there was nothing he
[39:59] did that made them do what they did to
[40:01] him. All right, everybody with me, sir.
[40:05] For what glory is it if when you be
[40:08] buffeted for your faults, you shall take
[40:12] it patiently? Question. But if when you
[40:16] do well and suffer for it, you take it
[40:19] patiently. This is acceptable with God.
[40:24] Oh, why am I going through this? Well,
[40:26] you Why am I doing Why is this happening
[40:28] to me? Why? Why? Why? Why? Well, it's to
[40:31] build your character. Yes, sir. Pass the
[40:34] test. Would you graduate? Do something.
[40:35] Go to the next level. Get out of the
[40:38] first grade. Quit whining.
[40:41] Everybody with me? Amen. Amen.
[40:45] Because if God don't make a mistake and
[40:48] God's perfect and his will is perfect
[40:51] and we're in this perfect word of God
[40:54] and we try to do the best we can the
[40:55] perfect will of God. Whatever's
[40:57] happening to us is for our good
[41:01] our good. Don't blame somebody else.
[41:03] It's for my good. So you can be a bucket
[41:07] mouth all you want to. I'm not going to
[41:08] hang around you long.
[41:10] Amen. Right. You're not going to bring
[41:13] me down.
[41:16] The devil does a lot of that. For even
[41:18] here unto were you called. Now listen,
[41:20] you were called for this. Yes, you were
[41:23] called to suffer. Look at every
[41:24] Christian that started from from the 12
[41:28] apostles.
[41:30] They all died except one. They were
[41:32] killed except one. John was the only one
[41:35] that was told, "You're going to see the
[41:36] kingdom." So, he had to write the book
[41:38] of Revelations. He was 96 years old when
[41:40] he died. But the other ones didn't even
[41:42] live past some of them in their 20s,
[41:44] 30s. James died. All the different ones,
[41:47] they were put to death, murdered for
[41:49] what they believed in. That's right. For
[41:52] what glory is it? For even unto here you
[41:54] were called because Christ also suffered
[41:56] for us, leaving us an example that you
[41:59] should follow his
[42:01] footsteps. Who did no sin, neither was
[42:04] God found in his mouth, who when he was
[42:06] reviled.
[42:10] This is a hard
[42:12] one. When he was
[42:15] reviled, he reviled not again.
[42:19] And when he suffered, he threatened not.
[42:22] Or when I get over this, I'll get
[42:24] you, Brother John. We We've all been
[42:28] through it. We've all been through it.
[42:30] You just wait, buddy. When this is over
[42:31] with, I'll get you. I get you when you
[42:34] ain't looking.
[42:36] Yeah. Well, that's not what Jesus did.
[42:39] Amen. Who when he was reviled, reviled
[42:42] not again. When he suffered, he
[42:43] threatened not, but committed himself to
[42:45] him that judges righteously. Amen. Who
[42:48] was his father? Who his own self bear
[42:51] our sin in his own body on the tree,
[42:54] that we being dead to sins should live
[42:56] under righteousness, by whose stripes
[42:59] you are healed. For you were as sheep
[43:01] going astray, but are now returned into
[43:04] the shepherd and bishop of your soul.
[43:08] Your chief shepherd is not me. Your
[43:10] chief shepherd is Jesus Christ.
[43:14] And he's the bishop of your soul. He's
[43:17] just given us a job to oversee his sheep
[43:20] and not do like that picture did.
[43:23] I get run
[43:26] over. So now, what is all this? What
[43:28] what is all what is God doing today? If
[43:32] we're in the adoption time and we're
[43:34] supposed to suffer to reign with him,
[43:36] listen, we're supposed to be different.
[43:39] You know, the old people you used to
[43:41] hang around, you had fun with. Admit it,
[43:46] boy. Y'all were some sad
[43:48] sacks. I had fun with the guys I was
[43:50] with,
[43:52] right? And I gave up all that because
[43:55] when Jesus Christ saved my soul, I
[43:57] didn't want that anymore.
[43:59] So, I suffered for it.
[44:02] Some of your best friends, how many some
[44:03] of your best friends walked away when
[44:04] you became a Christian?
[44:09] Why? Number one, your character was
[44:13] being built by God, not by them and the
[44:16] world.
[44:18] It was a different It was a different
[44:19] character, a different I don't I didn't
[44:21] want to go where I used to go before.
[44:23] But you suffered because I'm telling
[44:25] you, you still had that draw of the
[44:27] world trying to pull you back in. I hope
[44:29] that I hope I'm the only one that that
[44:31] happens to. I hope it does not happen to
[44:32] you guys. I really I'll take it all for
[44:34] me. But every day I have to keep myself.
[44:37] Amen. I have to let God keep myself. But
[44:40] I do have a part in it. Amen. Amen. You
[44:43] do have a part with this. You can't.
[44:44] You're just not a zombie.
[44:47] Okay. You have a will, a free will to do
[44:50] what you want to do. That's right.
[44:53] That's right. But remember, Jesus gave
[44:56] up his will. Yes, sir. in the garden.
[44:58] And he said, "Not my will, but thy will
[44:59] be done. My will, I would keep my
[45:02] disciples. They'd all be around me. I'
[45:04] like that little lamb. They'd be all
[45:05] mine. I'd shepherd them." But that's not
[45:07] what he came for. He knew when he gave
[45:10] up his will, he was going to the cross.
[45:13] And he was going to lose everything. All
[45:16] his friendship, even brother Brandham,
[45:17] my word, look at look at what happened
[45:19] to him. He was great back in the 50s
[45:21] when he was healing the sick and raising
[45:23] the dead. But when he come to the meat
[45:24] of the word of God, they started running
[45:26] away like flies. They started leaving
[45:27] him. Why? It wasn't Listen, those people
[45:30] didn't leave him
[45:33] because they were bad people.
[45:38] They just didn't like what he was
[45:39] saying. And what they didn't like and
[45:43] agree with, they didn't want to hang
[45:44] around no more. Everybody with me?
[45:48] That's why we're under this ministry of
[45:50] the third pull. It's a pull. It's
[45:52] pulling us up that mountain. It's
[45:54] pulling us towards something. And if you
[45:57] don't know that, it's also part of your
[45:59] placing because listen, I'm not I'm not
[46:02] we I don't have three arms.
[46:05] I have two arms.
[46:07] Christ had two arms. So you got to
[46:10] figure out what part you're in. What arm
[46:12] or your arm, your leg, back, toe, foot,
[46:15] whatever you want to, whatever you want
[46:17] to say. But you got to figure that out.
[46:20] Amen.
[46:22] When a bride realizes who she is and
[46:24] what she's doing here, she'll be an
[46:27] invincible army. Why? Because you know
[46:29] what we're doing? We're infighting.
[46:34] We're
[46:35] infighting. Preachers can't hardly stand
[46:37] to be around other preachers because
[46:38] they don't believe in a certain
[46:39] doctrine. Now, that's not the unity of
[46:42] Christ. You I thought Brother Ram told
[46:44] us you could bitterly disagree with
[46:45] somebody and still hug their neck and
[46:47] love them. Amen. and love them, right?
[46:50] Not just hug the neck and go, "Well, I
[46:52] have to." You know, you do
[46:55] that. I'll get your spirit. Don't come
[46:57] too close. No, you already got one. I
[46:59] promise you that.
[47:01] So, this prophet though had to come to
[47:03] restore everything. If he restored
[47:05] everything back, then we have the
[47:07] opportunity to be adopted. Yes. Cuz
[47:09] remember on Mount Transfiguration, Jesus
[47:11] stood and he said, the father said,
[47:13] "This is my son in whom I'm pleased to
[47:15] dwell." Well, he already said that
[47:16] before, but he added, "Hear ye him."
[47:20] In other words, the father is instilling
[47:22] into the son his mind just like he did
[47:24] with just like he did with Adam. Adam
[47:27] had the mind of God.
[47:29] Amen. Amen. Cuz that's what we're going
[47:31] back. That's why Paul said, I believe he
[47:33] picked it up and he thought, man, he
[47:35] said Adam lost
[47:36] everything cuz he had to accept Eve. He
[47:40] accepted her in his mind first. That's
[47:42] right. I don't want God to kill her.
[47:44] She's mine. She's a part of me. So, I'm
[47:47] going to take partake of her sin. Like
[47:49] Jesus Christ hanging on the cross. I'm
[47:50] going to partake of their sin. I've
[47:52] never done a sin in my life. Jesus said,
[47:55] "But I'm going to take on their sin so
[47:57] that they can become sinless."
[48:01] This plan is perfect. Amen. We're trying
[48:04] to figure out something that's perfect.
[48:06] You can't figure it out. You just got to
[48:08] do it. Yes, sir.
[48:11] Signpost. But you got to get in that
[48:13] car, put gas in it, and you got to drive
[48:15] where you listen. Do we all know where
[48:17] we're going?
[48:19] I'm going ask you a question
[48:21] today. Do you know where you're going?
[48:27] Oh, well, brother, wait. I'm going to be
[48:28] a banker. I'm going to be a this. I'm
[48:30] going to go to school. I ain't talking
[48:31] about that. Right. You come to church
[48:34] today, you become a Christian to be
[48:37] something. Yes, sir.
[48:40] Everybody with me? Amen.
[48:42] Okay. You come to
[48:44] church to find that out. That's right.
[48:47] To let God say, "Hey, here's your
[48:50] options."
[48:52] Right? This is what I want from you.
[48:56] And then you've got to say, "That's the
[48:58] part I want. That's the part I feel the
[49:01] pull." See, I never felt the pull to be
[49:04] a song
[49:05] leader. You've heard me sing. That
[49:08] absolutely would disqualify me from any
[49:10] of
[49:12] that. But some of you he did. Some of
[49:14] you he called to sing. Some of you that
[49:16] can sing. Some of you that that
[49:18] instruments I can't play one. I was
[49:20] called to preach.
[49:22] So I'm not going to throw myself into
[49:24] being a song leader unless I absolutely
[49:26] have
[49:27] to. We got some good ones here. And we
[49:30] got some good backups. Absolutely. And
[49:32] we sure appreciate every one of them.
[49:34] But that's God building a body. Yes.
[49:36] Right. That's God building an organism,
[49:39] not an organization.
[49:41] An organism where all the parts work
[49:43] together and everything comes together
[49:44] and works as one unit.
[49:47] So that's why that we see down through
[49:49] the church ages. You look at the
[49:50] Catholic Church and you see how much
[49:52] influence they have now. Think about
[49:54] what the influence they had at
[49:55] first. Cuz this was some new religion. I
[49:58] mean, what what do you mean a pope? They
[50:00] said Peter was the first pope. No, Peter
[50:02] wasn't the first pope. We know that,
[50:03] right? Everybody with me? He wasn't the
[50:06] first pope. He didn't get the keys from
[50:08] Jesus to the kingdom of being a pope.
[50:11] No, it was a revelation of who Jesus
[50:13] Christ was, which they missed.
[50:17] They missed. The apostles didn't miss it
[50:19] on the day of Pentecost. They said,
[50:21] "This is that." I like that. That's so
[50:24] positive. This is that. Like brother
[50:26] Emanuel was preaching Wednesday night. I
[50:28] am. Who's going to do this? I am going
[50:31] to do this.
[50:33] I might. No, I ain't what he said. He
[50:35] said, I am. I am. Who's the bride of
[50:38] Jesus Christ? I am. Amen. Who's going to
[50:41] take a rapture? I am. Yes, sir. Who's
[50:44] going to take a body change? I am.
[50:46] That's why I asked why, right? At first,
[50:48] he stood to Moses. He said, I am. That I
[50:51] am.
[50:53] I'm the person that's going to take a
[50:55] group of people and take them to a body
[50:57] change. Moses, I know this is 6,000
[50:59] years ahead of you. Come on. You know,
[51:02] in front in the future, but I'm going to
[51:04] start with you, sir. And I'm going to
[51:06] tell you, you go down to Egypt and you
[51:09] tell them that I am going to deliver
[51:13] these people. Yes, sir. And you know
[51:16] what? He proved it cuz he did. He did.
[51:19] Amen. You said, "No, God did it." Yes,
[51:21] sir. I listen. I know that. But there
[51:23] had to be a Moses there.
[51:26] There had to be a conduit. There had to
[51:28] be the vehicle
[51:30] to get it to the people because remember
[51:32] we decided to do it this way. Your
[51:35] ancestors decided on the mountain,
[51:38] right?
[51:40] Remember God said, "Moses, you bring
[51:42] them back to this mountain and I'll
[51:43] speak to them." He brought them right
[51:45] back to that mountain. The mountain was
[51:47] on fire. They looked at circumstances.
[51:51] Right? They looked at their self.
[51:54] I'm not worthy. He didn't ask you if
[51:56] you're worthy. He wanted you to come to
[51:58] that mountain.
[52:00] But when they got there, they said, "Oh,
[52:01] Moses, we don't want God to talk to us.
[52:04] Let him talk to you and then you tell us
[52:06] what he said." And this is where they
[52:08] lied, brother Collie. They said, "And
[52:10] we'll do it." And they never did. Right?
[52:13] But God knew that. But that was all set
[52:16] up by us. So this is the way we got to
[52:18] get it. And then we come to see, we see
[52:20] Paul. He looks back in the Old
[52:21] Testament. He sees what happened there
[52:24] uh on the mountain and he brings it
[52:25] down. And he says, "Hey, to get
[52:27] perfected, you're going to have to
[52:28] listen to apostles, prophets, pastors,
[52:30] teachers, and evangelists for the
[52:31] perfecting of the saints, for the
[52:33] edifying of the body." Yes, sir. Until
[52:34] we all come what? To the unity of the
[52:36] faith. Yes, sir. Amen. That's the way we
[52:39] get it. Amen.
[52:43] So, he's come to restore all things.
[52:45] That's why we needed a prophet in the
[52:47] end time to restore us back to where we
[52:50] can see more clear where Christ is.
[52:53] Amen. Where is he?
[52:57] He's in me. He's in you.
[53:01] This message is right.
[53:05] I'm not worried about the messenger
[53:06] being right.
[53:09] Come on. I'm worried about what he
[53:11] brought me. I know he's right. All that
[53:15] garbage they're saying about him, it's
[53:16] just it's just human garbage.
[53:20] I told the brother the other day, I
[53:21] said, "Did you believe the sign people?"
[53:23] They spend all their time berating
[53:26] brother Brandham.
[53:28] Well, tell me what you got. Come on.
[53:31] Tell me what you got to make me more
[53:33] perfect to with God. Give me what? Give
[53:35] me your message. Yes, sir. Right. If you
[53:38] say this is wrong, give me what you No.
[53:40] They spend 99% of their time berating
[53:43] brother Brandham. That's why I don't
[53:44] watch that garbage. I don't look at that
[53:46] garbage. I don't That's just
[53:48] garbage. It has no truth in it. No day
[53:50] of judgment. They'll find out. That's
[53:52] right. Hallelujah. So, we had to have a
[53:55] prophet to come and tell us. We had to
[53:56] have him come and do as as someone said
[53:59] the other day, why didn't Jesus
[54:02] just talk plain?
[54:07] He did talk plain. I can understand him
[54:10] very well.
[54:12] But remember, he said things to confound
[54:14] who? The wise and prudent and reveal
[54:17] them unto babes. He talked in parables,
[54:19] allegorories. He talked he told stories
[54:22] what to hide it. He said I thank you
[54:24] father that you've hid these things. In
[54:26] other words that you said through my
[54:28] mouth these things that's going to
[54:30] baffle the whole world.
[54:34] But now we got a message in the end time
[54:36] that the mysteries have been
[54:38] revealed. We know that the messenger not
[54:41] when he starts. Now remember not in a
[54:42] healing campaign that is that is
[54:45] secondary.
[54:48] Get your soul healed first. Right? Then
[54:51] work on your body getting healed. But
[54:52] then now work on your what? Your spirit
[54:54] realm. Yes. Our spirit realm is where we
[54:57] hurt the most.
[54:59] If you're born again, your soul does not
[55:02] hurt.
[55:05] Right. Amen.
[55:07] If it's born again, it it expects the
[55:09] word of God to be brought to it. Yes,
[55:10] sir. Amen. Exactly. But what happens is
[55:12] there's a filter that comes from my ear
[55:14] into some kind of little kind of a can
[55:17] that's got memories and conscious
[55:19] effects and imagination and I take it
[55:20] like that can and I shake it and then
[55:23] get all garbled up and then a little bit
[55:26] of it gets into my soul cuz every once
[55:28] in a while somebody will say amen. Well,
[55:30] when you say amen that means it went
[55:32] down to your soul and you got something.
[55:34] Yes, sir. Some of you ain't got anything
[55:36] ever
[55:39] by not saying amen.
[55:42] So we had to
[55:44] have what was Jesus talking about? Oh,
[55:47] he was talking about a
[55:49] trinity. Oh. Oh, Jesus was talking about
[55:51] an eternal hell. Oh, Jesus told us to
[55:54] baptize in father, son, and holy ghost.
[55:57] Uh Jesus told us this and told us that.
[56:00] Yeah, he
[56:01] did. But it became a mystery to people
[56:04] because soon as he died, they started
[56:06] saying it was he was one of three, one
[56:09] of two, a like substance, not the
[56:12] substance. They said, "Well, we got to
[56:13] baptize this away or there's three of
[56:16] them. So, Father, Son, Holy Ghost is a
[56:18] baptism, and we know there's an eternal
[56:20] hell now because now the Catholics are
[56:22] going to say, "Well, we need some extra
[56:23] money before you get to hell."
[56:29] Don't tell me they got Where'd they get
[56:30] purgatory from? Right? There's not that
[56:33] word in the Bible nowhere.
[56:36] Purgatory. They inserted purgatory so
[56:39] they could get rich. Right. If those of
[56:42] you that don't know what purgatory is,
[56:43] when you die, you go into this place of
[56:46] holding.
[56:48] And you're in that place of holding. If
[56:50] you believe the Catholic faith, you're
[56:52] in this place of holding. And then what
[56:54] happens is you don't have enough to get
[56:57] you over into the eternal part.
[57:00] Right?
[57:01] are the other part. So, you're in this
[57:04] kind of this limbo place. But if you're
[57:07] if you're if you're still on this side
[57:09] of the of the death, you got family
[57:11] members that's got some money.
[57:14] Purgatory is always tied to money.
[57:19] You got to pay
[57:22] to get your uncle out of purgatory.
[57:25] Ain't even a place
[57:27] when you leave this life. It's like
[57:30] brother Richard Wilson said when dad
[57:31] died he said he said brother Dale knew
[57:33] where to go when he died or when he
[57:35] passed from this earth to the next. He
[57:36] knew where he was going. Do you know
[57:38] where you're going? Do you know if you
[57:39] today if you close your eyes for the
[57:41] last time? Do you know where you're
[57:42] going to open your eyes at? Some of you
[57:43] already closed them. So you must be
[57:44] going there.
[57:52] But there had to be a Hey, brother
[57:53] Joseph. I'm a little funny something
[57:54] every once in a while. Good to see you
[57:56] again.
[58:00] But there's so much confusion. Yeah.
[58:02] This world is confused.
[58:06] Is this right? Is he the second person?
[58:09] Is this the right baptism? Is this the
[58:12] right Listen, we have we had a prophet
[58:15] come and he took all those things and he
[58:18] put them together. That's right. And it
[58:20] was exactly as Hattie Wright said, that
[58:23] ain't nothing but the truth. Amen.
[58:26] Because why? Something struck. She
[58:27] wasn't in a She wasn't in a church. She
[58:30] was in her kitchen probably had on her
[58:32] gown with her apron on and she was
[58:34] cooking supper. Everybody with me?
[58:38] And she said, "Brother Brandon, that
[58:40] ain't nothing but the truth." God came
[58:42] down and said, "Whatever you want, you
[58:44] can have." You know what? She came into
[58:48] a channel
[58:50] just as Mary come into a channel and
[58:52] said, "Be it unto me according to thy
[58:54] word." They came into a channel to where
[58:56] God was already there waiting on them,
[58:59] right? And what was said from their
[59:01] mouth made the difference?
[59:05] Amen. That's right. Isn't that the same
[59:07] way with us that you come to a place
[59:10] where God wants to see what you'll do?
[59:12] Amen. Come on. He want to see what you
[59:14] can what you'll do and what you can do.
[59:17] And listen, if you can't, then I I
[59:20] believe dad told me years and years ago,
[59:22] I believe I believe Abram was not the
[59:25] only person God spoke to cuz he's not a
[59:27] respector of persons. Abram was the only
[59:29] one that got up and did what he said. He
[59:31] might have spoke to many virgins in the
[59:33] time because it wasn't it didn't say a
[59:34] virgin shall it didn't say Mary shall
[59:36] conceive.
[59:38] It said a virgin shall conceive and
[59:41] bring forth a child.
[59:43] There's no telling how many people he
[59:45] might have come to as an angel. And and
[59:46] Gabriel says, "Hail Susie or Sarah or
[59:50] whatever." And they're like, "No, I
[59:52] ain't doing that. I don't believe that."
[59:56] Yeah. But Mary said, "Be it unto me
[59:58] according to thy word." Whatever it is,
[59:59] I'm here. Amen. I've read about this. I
[1:00:02] know the word of God says that a virgin
[1:00:04] is going to have a baby. Amen. In other
[1:00:07] words, I'm going to say it today. Let me
[1:00:09] have it. That's right, Lord. It's your
[1:00:12] will. Let me have it.
[1:00:15] And what did it do? It produced the body
[1:00:17] of Jesus Christ. Aren't we supposed to
[1:00:19] produce the
[1:00:22] body of Jesus Christ on this earth?
[1:00:25] Amen. So, let's start by doing the same
[1:00:27] thing. Be it unto me, Lord, according to
[1:00:29] your word. Whatever you got, I want.
[1:00:32] Because if God gives you something,
[1:00:33] remember, he'll never take it back. And
[1:00:36] it's always eternal and it's always
[1:00:38] perfect and it always works. He never
[1:00:41] had a oops moment. He never a moment
[1:00:42] where he said I don't mean I didn't mean
[1:00:44] to do that. I didn't mean to pick
[1:00:46] Brother Collie. I really didn't. He is
[1:00:48] so messed up. No, he didn't say that.
[1:00:52] Praise the Lord. God can't change his
[1:00:54] mind, folks. If he ever loved you, as we
[1:00:56] said before, you'll get a revelation. I
[1:00:58] did not too long ago. If he ever loved
[1:01:00] you to begin with and saw his character
[1:01:03] somewhere in your life,
[1:01:06] When he said that's mine, he can't
[1:01:08] change his mind.
[1:01:10] You can't say a day in your life, God
[1:01:12] don't love me. God ain't where I'm God
[1:01:14] ain't where I'm at. Maybe you're not
[1:01:16] where God's at. Amen. But he gave you
[1:01:20] something.
[1:01:21] He either gave you something to do
[1:01:25] or he may have called you just for one
[1:01:27] sermon. Now, brother Emanuel, that is
[1:01:29] not for you.
[1:01:32] But
[1:01:33] remember, brother B said he groom a man
[1:01:36] for one sermon.
[1:01:38] He groomed John the Baptist for six
[1:01:40] months and that was it. No prayer lines.
[1:01:44] Nobody was saved under his ministry.
[1:01:47] He came to do one thing. Introduce the
[1:01:50] Messiah. And then what happened to him?
[1:01:53] Ridiculed, despised, got his head cut
[1:01:55] off. Yes.
[1:01:58] So, we had to have somebody to tell us
[1:02:02] where God is.
[1:02:05] And I believe that this message will
[1:02:07] tell us and show us where God is. Yes.
[1:02:13] What his character is, what what
[1:02:15] everything that you do, the things that
[1:02:18] you
[1:02:22] do, I know it's already predestinated by
[1:02:24] God. You understand me? Predetermined.
[1:02:26] But he didn't predetermine it for
[1:02:29] you. We'll get into predestination in a
[1:02:31] little bit. Remember, one more time.
[1:02:32] Wake
[1:02:34] up. He knew what you would do.
[1:02:38] Therefore, he predetermined it by what
[1:02:40] you are doing now.
[1:02:43] Because remember, fornowledge is first
[1:02:45] then predestination. Absolutely. Those
[1:02:48] who he forneew, he did predestinate. if
[1:02:50] he didn't for know you. That's why that
[1:02:52] that there's people that are in a book
[1:02:55] called the book of life. But there's a
[1:02:58] group of people that's in a lamb's book
[1:02:59] of life, an eternal section that can
[1:03:02] never be changed. Amen. That's the bride
[1:03:04] of Jesus Christ. That's the ones that he
[1:03:06] he's coming for. That's the one he wants
[1:03:09] to be his wife. Yes. Amen. To have his
[1:03:13] character to know what he wants.
[1:03:15] real scary sometimes when you live
[1:03:17] together long enough till you look at
[1:03:19] each other and you go say something and
[1:03:23] your sweetheart looks at you and says I
[1:03:25] was thinking the same
[1:03:27] thing kind of scary
[1:03:30] sister especially with
[1:03:33] him but no don't you do that sometimes
[1:03:36] you'll look at you and you say man I
[1:03:37] thought about the same let's do that
[1:03:38] let's do that I was thinking about doing
[1:03:40] the same thing well what was it is you
[1:03:41] we become so much together till you know
[1:03:45] I know June does not like now listen to
[1:03:47] this you ready June does not like
[1:03:51] flowers right I know that praise
[1:03:58] God cuz you just can give flowers but
[1:04:00] you can't give them enough and seven
[1:04:03] days
[1:04:04] later they get put in a trash can and
[1:04:08] there goes your $80 brother Danny could
[1:04:11] have brought shells yeah right And uh
[1:04:15] boom in a trash can. I know my wife
[1:04:18] likes chocolate.
[1:04:23] So see I know the character of my wife.
[1:04:25] Why would I even try to buy her flowers?
[1:04:30] Amen. The other day I tricked her. I
[1:04:34] bought her
[1:04:35] flowers but they were
[1:04:40] chocolate. It was a bouquet. They were
[1:04:42] sticking out like this. They were about
[1:04:44] this big. And they were red. Looked just
[1:04:46] I mean from afar they look like real
[1:04:49] flowers. Yeah. But it was
[1:04:52] chocolate. Dark chocolate. She likes
[1:04:55] dark chocolate. So you see what I mean?
[1:04:57] So God, same way with God. When we come
[1:05:00] to this stage of adoption, he knows our
[1:05:02] character. He knows what we like and
[1:05:04] don't like. But remember, more than
[1:05:07] anything, we know what he likes and what
[1:05:10] he doesn't like. Right? Cuz we can
[1:05:12] change our like and dislike. He can't
[1:05:15] change his like and dislike. So when we
[1:05:18] when we know he likes something, it
[1:05:21] doesn't matter who does it, he's
[1:05:23] pleased.
[1:05:25] And he's pleased to dwell in you by the
[1:05:27] Holy Ghost. Amen. Amen. Pleased to dwell
[1:05:29] in you. But he did not say to Jesus,
[1:05:31] "Here you him." Right? At first, he had
[1:05:33] to wait a while, a few years of child
[1:05:35] training and training and brought up in
[1:05:38] the humanity that he was.
[1:05:41] Same way with me and you. He knows we're
[1:05:43] not He knows Paul says, "I know your
[1:05:46] babies. I know you like
[1:05:48] milk." But he said strong meat are for
[1:05:51] those that are advanced, those that are
[1:05:54] of full age. So there's got to be meat
[1:05:56] in part of what we're taking, not just
[1:05:59] milk. We start out drinking milk. I like
[1:06:02] milk. Had a little bit this morning, but
[1:06:04] I ain't going to have it this afternoon.
[1:06:05] I'm going to have steak or something.
[1:06:08] Jim's leaving so we got me and mama's
[1:06:10] going to go eat
[1:06:11] somewhere. But you know that really you
[1:06:15] look at your
[1:06:16] spouse and you know their likes and
[1:06:18] dislikes.
[1:06:20] If you don't, they'll tell you them.
[1:06:24] Well, praise the Lord.
[1:06:26] Cuz sometimes we don't pay attention. We
[1:06:28] have selective hearing and yeah, June
[1:06:31] says, "I need a herinade." No, I just
[1:06:32] need to listen more.
[1:06:36] But you know what? That's the same thing
[1:06:37] with God. As you're a Christian today,
[1:06:40] we'll stop right here. As you're a
[1:06:41] Christian
[1:06:44] today, as you being a Christian today,
[1:06:47] you ought to know what pleases God.
[1:06:52] I'm talking about today,
[1:06:54] 2025. Right here, today, whatever this
[1:06:57] is, May the whatever it is,
[1:07:00] 11th. Thank you. Somebody always has to
[1:07:02] be specific. May the 11th. But God knows
[1:07:08] you, but you should also know what makes
[1:07:12] him happy and what makes him sad.
[1:07:16] Now, you can go to the Baptist church
[1:07:19] today and you can say, "Well, I can wear
[1:07:22] pants into the church and that makes God
[1:07:25] happy." They do it all the time. I saw
[1:07:28] we saw some the other day on a pair of
[1:07:29] shorts and went to church on
[1:07:31] Sunday. Flip-flops. And you say, "Well,
[1:07:34] it don't mean anything." Well, yes it
[1:07:36] did. It sure did. It means a lot. Means
[1:07:39] a lot to God because you told you not,
[1:07:40] you know, if you come to me, then you
[1:07:43] bring, you know, bring your burdens to
[1:07:44] me, but don't bring don't bring it in,
[1:07:46] you know,
[1:07:48] jeans and shorts, right? I mean, come
[1:07:51] on. But see, don't you sisters and
[1:07:53] brothers know then we know what God
[1:07:54] likes and dislikes. Everybody with me?
[1:07:57] All right. We've read it. A prophets
[1:07:59] told us. And that's what a prophet done,
[1:08:01] brother John. He put us He put us He
[1:08:03] made sure we were in the right vehicle.
[1:08:06] Amen. He made sure we were on the right
[1:08:09] road.
[1:08:10] Then he gave us signs.
[1:08:13] Yeah.
[1:08:15] Hallelujah. There'll be earthquake.
[1:08:17] It'll shake California. Drop it to the
[1:08:19] ground to the to the ocean. There'll be
[1:08:21] earthquakes in many places. There'll be
[1:08:24] all these different things that he
[1:08:25] prophesied. A pope will come out of the
[1:08:27] United States. That was in 1955
[1:08:30] that he said that.
[1:08:32] So we're on the right road. We got the
[1:08:36] right vehicle. Yes, sir. We should know
[1:08:38] what God likes and don't like.
[1:08:41] So what's our problem?
[1:08:45] Our problem
[1:08:47] is we're not placed yet. We've got one
[1:08:50] more step in this adoption process is to
[1:08:54] place. Now to place or to fix or
[1:08:57] establish. Now, that's gonna put you
[1:08:58] over here. Brother Ram told us, come on,
[1:09:00] musicians. Brother Ram told us, No, wait
[1:09:02] a minute. We're having communion. Sorry.
[1:09:04] So, Brother Ram told us, he said, "Now,
[1:09:07] Ephereim, it woke you up." Anyway,
[1:09:10] Ephereim, come
[1:09:12] over and he got this part of the land.
[1:09:15] Remember Joshua? We'll get into that
[1:09:16] later on. He said, "All right, your name
[1:09:19] is this. So, you get this piece of land
[1:09:21] and then your Manasses, you get this
[1:09:23] piece of land according to your name."
[1:09:26] Everybody with me? Amen. Now, brother R
[1:09:29] made the example. He said, "Why if
[1:09:31] Ephereim is to produce corn, Manasseh is
[1:09:34] to produce
[1:09:36] oil, why is Manasseh planting corn over
[1:09:39] here in Ephraim's on Ephereim's ground?"
[1:09:42] It wasn't their position, right? And
[1:09:44] that's what got them all
[1:09:45] discombobodulated in the in the what? In
[1:09:47] the promised land, they started letting
[1:09:50] things go. They started bringing in all
[1:09:53] the Hivites and and Jebusites and
[1:09:55] letting them live among them.
[1:09:59] That wasn't supposed to be right. That
[1:10:01] was their promised land. They were
[1:10:03] supposed to drive all the enemies out.
[1:10:06] Amen. Every one of them.
[1:10:09] They had the authority to do it.
[1:10:12] Because he told Joshua, I was reading
[1:10:14] this morning, he told Joshua, he said,
[1:10:15] "Wherever you go and whatever you do,
[1:10:18] I'll be with you." Right? Whatever you
[1:10:20] do, even in Joshua, even if you make a
[1:10:23] mistake, a human error, I'll be right
[1:10:25] there with you.
[1:10:28] The only time they ever lost men was
[1:10:30] when somebody in his congregation,
[1:10:33] right?
[1:10:35] Somebody in his in his platoon
[1:10:39] did something he was not told to do.
[1:10:40] Remember, God said, "Don't take
[1:10:43] anything." He said, "It's defiled." Yes.
[1:10:46] Right.
[1:10:47] But a little wedge of gold and a little
[1:10:49] bitty garment and it ended up costing
[1:10:52] him his life and his family. 12 men or
[1:10:55] 30 something men got killed. And from
[1:10:57] that point on, everything just got kind
[1:10:59] of got
[1:11:01] convoluted. If you ever let sin in
[1:11:03] account, we got to get it out.
[1:11:05] And I know we all have sin. We all have
[1:11:07] things that we do wrong. But when we
[1:11:09] come to church, do like I said, before
[1:11:12] you enter that door, say, "God, Amen.
[1:11:14] I've done wrong things this this this
[1:11:16] this week. I've done wrong things this
[1:11:18] morning.
[1:11:20] But God, you know my heart. I want to
[1:11:21] come in here and sit and listen to what
[1:11:23] you got for me today. Amen. I want to
[1:11:25] sit and listen to what song you got for
[1:11:26] me to sing today.
[1:11:29] What instrument that you have me play
[1:11:31] today. There's parts that we must play.
[1:11:33] All of us have a part to play in this.
[1:11:36] Let's stand to our feet. We'll we'll get
[1:11:37] to some a little bit
[1:11:40] later because we got to come to the hear
[1:11:42] yehe him part. and we will later on um
[1:11:46] I'll be speaking Wednesday night so
[1:11:48] we'll continue on it for Wednesday. So
[1:11:52] um the
[1:11:54] communion I know that
[1:11:57] u and here in we see um uh you know u we
[1:12:01] talked about this a little bit
[1:12:04] um you know it was it was kind of
[1:12:06] strange there was 22 22
[1:12:11] um pastors. It wasn't preachers. They
[1:12:14] were pastors. Everybody that went to
[1:12:15] that place was a pastor. But there was
[1:12:17] 22 pastors in there
[1:12:19] and they didn't any of
[1:12:22] them make their own wine, did they? J
[1:12:24] didn't didn't any of them make their own
[1:12:26] wine. They bought it. So we got
[1:12:29] discussion that I said, "Man, it's the
[1:12:30] easiest thing to
[1:12:32] do. Sugar, water, grind them up, pay the
[1:12:38] next door neighbor to stomp them, do
[1:12:40] something." But it's real simple to do.
[1:12:43] And then it's done made by holy hands
[1:12:45] because you look, you say, "Well, it's
[1:12:47] you're nitpicking." Well, I look over
[1:12:49] and see a bottle of wine that they had
[1:12:52] to go to a liquor store to buy and it's
[1:12:55] got it's got yeast in it. Yeast is
[1:12:58] living not supposed to be in there.
[1:13:01] Sugar and water and that's it. And the
[1:13:03] and the fruit of the vi of the vine,
[1:13:05] right? But they put yeast in theirs to
[1:13:08] help it
[1:13:09] ferment. No. I said, 'N no, we, my dad's
[1:13:13] never, we have never bought wine. And
[1:13:15] since 1971, we've always made our own.
[1:13:18] And I got to make some more because a
[1:13:19] lot of people taking communion. And I
[1:13:21] appreciate that. I appreciate you taking
[1:13:24] communion. You said, "Well, I'm not
[1:13:26] worthy." Now, who told you
[1:13:29] that? Who told you
[1:13:31] that? Did God tell you you wasn't
[1:13:33] worthy? Then you do got a problem. But
[1:13:36] if it's the devil telling you that,
[1:13:37] well, you know, you did this. You know
[1:13:39] what brother said? He said, "Even if
[1:13:40] you've done
[1:13:42] something, am I quoting brother Brown?"
[1:13:44] He said, "Even if you've done something,
[1:13:45] you have an odd against a brother." He
[1:13:47] said, "You take communion." He said,
[1:13:48] "But go make it right." Right? That's
[1:13:52] why we take examination. We take just a
[1:13:54] few minutes of silent prayer. And I
[1:13:57] asked, "Lord, clear my
[1:13:59] slate. Make everything back to zero.
[1:14:02] Bring everything under your subjection.
[1:14:04] Even the things I know I did wrong last
[1:14:06] week. I know I did it cuz I did
[1:14:09] it and he knew it too. But there's a
[1:14:13] time of reckoning to where we come to
[1:14:15] take communion to where we say, "Lord,
[1:14:17] we're going to do this institution
[1:14:20] because you said to do it and you made
[1:14:24] arrangements for us to do it and you
[1:14:28] made it very important for us to do it
[1:14:29] because he said if you don't do
[1:14:31] this, even the footwashing, he said if
[1:14:33] you Peter, if you don't do this, you'll
[1:14:34] have no part in my kingdom." That's
[1:14:36] right.
[1:14:38] That's pretty to me that's pretty
[1:14:40] strong. Amen. And he said, "Here's the
[1:14:43] fruit." He said, "Drink it in my blood."
[1:14:47] Do this in remembrance of me. Let's
[1:14:50] remember today what God did for us.
[1:14:53] Amen. Amen. Let's bow our heads just for
[1:14:55] a second. Dear heavenly father,
[1:14:57] Lord, we're all just a bunch of sinners
[1:15:00] saved by grace. But Father, you gave us
[1:15:02] a perpetuation. You gave us a not an
[1:15:05] out. You gave us a way of escape though
[1:15:08] that we can escape sin. And even if we
[1:15:11] do sin, there's a blood covering there
[1:15:12] that'll cover it. And we are sorry that
[1:15:15] we did it, Lord. We're truly sorry. And
[1:15:18] Lord, I pray that you'd clean our slate.
[1:15:19] All of us, Lord. Take all the wants and
[1:15:22] desires of this world away from us,
[1:15:24] Lord. Even if we have to suffer a little
[1:15:26] bit, Lord, to reign with you for an
[1:15:28] eternity should be well worth it for
[1:15:30] every one of us instead of the temporary
[1:15:32] things that we let get in our way here.
[1:15:34] Father, take those out of the way for
[1:15:36] each one of us, Lord. We ask in Jesus
[1:15:38] name. Amen. Bible said he took bread and
[1:15:42] blessed him. Dear heavenly father, Lord,
[1:15:43] thank you for this bread. It's been made
[1:15:45] with holy hands. Lord, I pray now that
[1:15:46] it's comes to our lips and we partake
[1:15:49] it, Lord. That we'll remember that you
[1:15:51] hung on a cruel cross just for me,
[1:15:53] Father. Just for each one, Lord, that's
[1:15:55] part of your part of your kingdom and
[1:15:57] your progeny, Lord. You came here to to
[1:15:59] get us and bring us back and reconcile
[1:16:01] us to you, Father. Now I pray as we take
[1:16:03] this we'll remember you Lord and
[1:16:05] remember that's what you did for us in
[1:16:07] Jesus name. Amen.
[1:16:15] I I don't want this to be a
[1:16:17] formality. Um I know some people know
[1:16:20] the churches they only take it once a
[1:16:22] year once every six months once every
[1:16:24] three months. Um one brother said we
[1:16:27] take it when we're ready. I said well
[1:16:29] we'd never take it. I mean, when you
[1:16:31] just everybody everybody in here says,
[1:16:32] "Oh, I'm ready." No, don't worry about
[1:16:35] that. Don't worry about
[1:16:39] that. He come He come to save imperfect
[1:16:42] people. He didn't come to save perfect
[1:16:44] people. He came to make imperfect people
[1:16:47] perfect.
[1:16:50] He came He went to the perfect and what
[1:16:52] happened? They turned him down. Or the
[1:16:55] so perfect, you know, people of the day.
[1:16:59] They turned him down. The very word of
[1:17:01] God that that they were that they lived
[1:17:03] by the whole
[1:17:04] time. They turned him down, killed
[1:17:08] him. Dear heavenly father, thank you for
[1:17:10] this wine, Lord. It's been made for one
[1:17:12] purpose and for us to partake, Lord,
[1:17:14] knowing that you spilled your blood at
[1:17:16] Calvary. And Lord, now the life that's
[1:17:18] in the blood has come back on the
[1:17:20] believer, Lord, to help us, Father. Just
[1:17:22] be with each one that's in this
[1:17:23] sanctuary, Lord. May we look to you,
[1:17:26] Lord, the author and finisher of our
[1:17:27] faith in Jesus name.
[1:17:30] Amen. Come morning, I'll walk by the
[1:17:37] river. I'll rest neat the
[1:17:41] evergreen
[1:17:44] tree. I'll carry my
[1:17:48] cross through the
[1:17:52] midnight. Come morning, there's glory
[1:17:56] for me.
[1:17:59] Sometimes I'm
[1:18:01] despised and rejected
[1:18:05] suffering. And I question, oh
[1:18:09] father, how
[1:18:12] long? Then I take one more look at Mount
[1:18:19] Calvary and it gives me the strength to
[1:18:24] go on. You know, the Bible tells us that
[1:18:28] those who endure to the end. So, you got
[1:18:30] to endure. It didn't say those who
[1:18:32] coasted to the end. It didn't say those
[1:18:34] who roller skated to the end or that
[1:18:36] that drove, you know, a wonderful
[1:18:39] vehicle. No. No. Those who endure. And
[1:18:43] you put in whatever beside that endure
[1:18:45] is. You put whatever you endure. That's
[1:18:47] your part. But remember, it's to build
[1:18:50] character. It's never to hurt you. God's
[1:18:53] never God can't hurt his own kids. True.
[1:18:55] He can't hurt his own bride. I mean,
[1:18:58] even like we have
[1:19:01] some heated discussions sometimes
[1:19:03] between our spouses. He doesn't. He
[1:19:07] said, "Look, I give you the thing to
[1:19:09] do." Amen. If you'll do that, we're
[1:19:11] good. But he does have to whip us in
[1:19:14] line every once in a
[1:19:15] while, and it ain't fun.
[1:19:19] But every time, brother Dy, you look to
[1:19:21] Calvary and you say,
[1:19:23] "Look, Paul said the present
[1:19:26] suffering is not
[1:19:28] worthy to be, in other words, shown or
[1:19:32] revealed in the end time." Listen, when
[1:19:34] we get to glory, we were talking about
[1:19:36] this in Jamaica. When we get to glory,
[1:19:38] you know, you had a rough time. Um, I
[1:19:41] know some of you, um, Sister Charlotte,
[1:19:43] you know, we miss Brother Richard and
[1:19:46] Brother Gary and all the different ones.
[1:19:47] Brother Dick, uh, Brother Al, all the
[1:19:50] different
[1:19:51] ones. But I believe God's going to tell
[1:19:54] you why he did it.
[1:19:57] I believe he's going to tell you, why he
[1:20:00] took him at that time, why he took this
[1:20:02] person at that time. Because remember,
[1:20:04] only God can take life. Satan cannot
[1:20:06] take your life.
[1:20:08] Hello. Only God can take a life. And
[1:20:12] when he's finished with you, just like
[1:20:13] brother Dale, same thing. When he's
[1:20:14] finished with you, we don't qu Yeah. we
[1:20:17] question in our humanity. But I believe
[1:20:19] God's obligated to tell his children why
[1:20:22] he did it. True. So I believe all
[1:20:24] anything you've had in your life, you
[1:20:25] want to go, God, why' I do that? Or why
[1:20:28] did this happen to me when I was doing
[1:20:30] this? I believe he's obligated to tell
[1:20:32] you. And when we get over
[1:20:34] there before the former things pass
[1:20:37] away, behold, all things have become
[1:20:39] new. I believe he'll pull us over to the
[1:20:41] side and he'll say, "Hey, this is why I
[1:20:43] did that. I did it for your good. I did
[1:20:46] it for their good. We don't understand
[1:20:49] that. Sometimes we don't. We wrestle
[1:20:52] with
[1:20:53] it. But oh my, the glory that's going to
[1:20:56] be revealed when we get there when
[1:20:59] everything we don't have to go home. We
[1:21:00] don't have to be tired. We don't have to
[1:21:03] we don't have to depart. You can travel
[1:21:04] like a thought. If you need to go talk
[1:21:06] to Brother Dy, we can go talk to brother
[1:21:08] Dy. Or you can go to uh um
[1:21:15] H. Oh, okay. We'll read we'll read it
[1:21:17] before we take
[1:21:22] it. Thank you, brother. Sometimes I get
[1:21:24] to talking and I forget what I'm
[1:21:25] doing. So, let's read our communion
[1:21:28] scripture for brother Collie. Got
[1:21:29] brother
[1:21:31] Collie. That's what we're doing. We're
[1:21:33] waiting on him. For I have received of
[1:21:36] the Lord that which also I delivered
[1:21:37] unto you, that the Lord Jesus the same
[1:21:39] what night in which he was betrayed took
[1:21:40] bread. Now, remember this is Paul. Paul
[1:21:42] wasn't there. So Paul got a vision,
[1:21:46] a more sure word, a prophet telling us
[1:21:49] exactly what happened. Cuz wait, Peter
[1:21:51] was there, John was there. Why didn't
[1:21:53] they write about it? He wanted Paul as
[1:21:56] an outside interpreter to look and and
[1:21:59] look by vision and say this is exactly
[1:22:02] because they might have missed
[1:22:03] something, but when you see a vision,
[1:22:05] you don't miss anything.
[1:22:07] When he had given thanks, he broke it
[1:22:09] and said, "Take, eat. This is my body
[1:22:10] which is broken for you. this do in
[1:22:12] remembrance of me. After the same manner
[1:22:14] also he took the cup and when he had
[1:22:16] sucked, saying this cup is the new
[1:22:17] testament in my blood. This do you as
[1:22:20] often as you drink it in remembrance of
[1:22:21] me. For as often as you eat this bread
[1:22:23] and drink this cup, you do show the
[1:22:25] Lord's death till he comes. Wherefore,
[1:22:28] whosoever shall eat this bread and drink
[1:22:30] this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be
[1:22:32] guilty of the body and blood of the
[1:22:34] Lord. But let a man examine himself.
[1:22:36] That's what we're doing. Examine
[1:22:37] yourself. And so let him eat of that
[1:22:39] bread and drink of that cup. For he that
[1:22:41] eateth and drinkkeeth unworthily eateth
[1:22:43] and drinkketh damnation to himself, not
[1:22:45] discerning the Lord's body. And who are
[1:22:48] the Lord's body is his bride. For this
[1:22:50] cause many are weak and sickly among
[1:22:52] you, many sleep. For if we would judge
[1:22:55] oursel, we should not be judged. But
[1:22:57] when we are judged, we are chasened of
[1:22:58] the Lord that we should not be condemned
[1:23:00] with the world. Praise God. Wherefore,
[1:23:03] my brethren, when you come together to
[1:23:05] eat, tarry one for another. And if any
[1:23:07] man hunger, let him meet at home that he
[1:23:09] comes not together into condemnation.
[1:23:10] And the rest will set in order when I
[1:23:13] come. You know, if this pope is the last
[1:23:15] one, if he's the one that's going to to
[1:23:17] be the u to be the uh incarnate
[1:23:21] antichrist, he don't know there's a
[1:23:23] group of
[1:23:25] people. He might know later on, but he
[1:23:27] don't know there's a bride on the
[1:23:29] earth that he can't control.
[1:23:33] He cannot control her. Will not control
[1:23:35] her. Listen, he will not stop her.
[1:23:39] He can't stop the bride. He can't stop
[1:23:42] the word of God being made manifest. I
[1:23:44] don't care how powerful he thinks he is
[1:23:47] with the next man that he thinks is
[1:23:48] powerful. He's not going to stop the
[1:23:50] word of God. So, get in the word of God,
[1:23:53] folks. Get in this lifeboat and let's
[1:23:55] get out of here. Let's take communion.
[1:24:05] Thank you,
[1:24:08] Lord. Now, remember sisters, after we
[1:24:11] read the the uh scripture for
[1:24:14] footwashing, as you go downstairs,
[1:24:16] Brother Ryan will be at the back door
[1:24:18] giving you a little uh giving you a
[1:24:20] little uh offering, little something
[1:24:23] from the church that we appreciate all
[1:24:25] you sisters. Like I said before, you may
[1:24:27] not be a mother. You may have never
[1:24:29] birthed a child.
[1:24:31] But that's not everything.
[1:24:35] Nurturing, living the life of Jesus
[1:24:38] Christ in front of somebody, that's
[1:24:40] worth way more than putting a title of a
[1:24:42] mother there. Okay. Like I said before,
[1:24:45] help the sisters that have children just
[1:24:48] for a few minutes. Just hang on to them.
[1:24:50] I I like to um Zach Nana's little baby.
[1:24:55] I like to hold she don't like me much,
[1:24:56] but at least if I hold her for a few
[1:24:59] minutes, it gives them a chance to run
[1:25:00] to the bathroom or go do something or or
[1:25:03] uh you know, run after the other two
[1:25:05] kids. But um but just be mindful that
[1:25:09] that that to help the sisters,
[1:25:12] brothers, love your wives even as Christ
[1:25:15] loved the church and gave his
[1:25:18] life for you. He gave up being the daddy
[1:25:23] natural. He gave up being a husband
[1:25:26] natural.
[1:25:29] He gave up all these things so that you
[1:25:31] and I can live on this earth, believe in
[1:25:35] him, and get out of this place. Cuz I'm
[1:25:39] telling you, if this is the right if
[1:25:40] this is the right scenario, it'll take
[1:25:42] them a little while to get everything
[1:25:44] set up. But you just watch. Craft will
[1:25:47] prosper.
[1:25:49] Then you'll read the scripture where it
[1:25:50] says peace, peace, then sudden
[1:25:51] destruction. We're going to have peace.
[1:25:53] It's going to be something. You watch.
[1:25:56] It's going to be. But they're getting
[1:25:58] ready behind the scenes. Brother John,
[1:25:59] they've been doing this for years.
[1:26:02] Someone told us years ago that the
[1:26:03] Catholic Church looked 30 years ahead.
[1:26:06] They couldn't see Pope Francis being the
[1:26:08] pope, but they knew that the pope once
[1:26:10] that pope got in, this is the pope they
[1:26:12] wanted to do what they wanted to do.
[1:26:15] Listen, there's a lot of fine people in
[1:26:17] the Catholic Church. Praise God for
[1:26:18] them. But that system is the Antichrist.
[1:26:23] But remember, she had daughters, too.
[1:26:26] It's all evil if you're not in Christ.
[1:26:30] If you're not in Christ, you're anti
[1:26:32] Antichrist. So, let's stay into Christ.
[1:26:34] Get into Christ. Love the Lord. Let's
[1:26:36] read the footwashing. And then your
[1:26:37] sisters, head downstairs. And u we love
[1:26:41] you with the love of the Lord. Thank you
[1:26:42] so much. Pray for sister June. her her
[1:26:44] uh sister's not well, so she's going to
[1:26:46] go stay with her for a few days. And uh
[1:26:48] and also remember that the neighbors
[1:26:50] have a dog over here and he got
[1:26:52] unleashed a little while ago and run one
[1:26:54] of the kids around Ula run ula around in
[1:26:57] the parking lot. So let me know when
[1:26:59] that happens and I'll go speak to them.
[1:27:00] But they did put it back and chained it
[1:27:02] back up. It's never been unchained. I've
[1:27:03] always been up here doing stuff and he
[1:27:05] always and it is pretty it's a bulldog I
[1:27:07] think isn't it? Pitbull. Yeah. So just
[1:27:10] be just men be mindful. If it does come
[1:27:13] over here one more time, we'll have
[1:27:15] we'll call animal control and we'll let
[1:27:17] them let them deal with it. Don't try to
[1:27:20] deal with it yourself. Don't make
[1:27:22] neighbors mad, okay? Cuz they don't know
[1:27:25] no better and I don't think they did it
[1:27:27] on purpose. So, but still be vigilant,
[1:27:30] okay? So, let's read the footwashing
[1:27:32] scripture. And supper being ended, the
[1:27:34] devil having now put into the heart of
[1:27:35] Judas this carrot, the Simon's son, to
[1:27:37] betray him. Jesus knowing that the
[1:27:38] father had given all things into his
[1:27:40] hand and that he was come from God and
[1:27:42] he went to God. He rises from supper and
[1:27:45] laid aside his garment and took a towel
[1:27:47] and girded himself. After that he poured
[1:27:49] water in a basin and began to wash the
[1:27:51] disciples feet and to wipe them with a
[1:27:52] towel wherewith he was girded. Then
[1:27:55] cometh he to Simon Peter. And Peter said
[1:27:57] unto him, Lord, dust thou wash my feet?
[1:27:59] Jesus answered and said unto him, what I
[1:28:01] do thou knowest not now, but thou shalt
[1:28:03] know hereafter? He was always telling
[1:28:04] He's always telling Peter, "Peter, I
[1:28:06] know you got a problem, but you know,
[1:28:07] you're going to be the spokesperson for
[1:28:09] this, so just hang on a little while."
[1:28:11] Peter said unto him, "Thou shalt never
[1:28:13] wash my feet." Don't ever tell Jesus,
[1:28:14] "Never." Jesus answered and said, "If I
[1:28:16] wash thee not, thou hast no part with
[1:28:18] me." Simon Peter said unto him, Lord,
[1:28:20] not my feet only, but also my hands and
[1:28:22] my head. Jesus said unto him, he that is
[1:28:25] washed neither not saved to wash his
[1:28:27] feet, but is clean every wit. And you
[1:28:29] are clean, but not all. For he knew who
[1:28:31] should betray him. Therefore he said,
[1:28:33] "You are not all clean." So after he had
[1:28:35] washed their feet and had taken the
[1:28:36] garment and was sat down, he said unto
[1:28:38] them, "Know ye what I have done to you?"
[1:28:40] Now they didn't, but they would
[1:28:42] hereafter. You call me Master and Lord?
[1:28:45] And you say, "Well, for so I am. If I
[1:28:48] then your Lord and Master have washed
[1:28:49] your feet, you also ought to wash one
[1:28:51] another's feet." You see Jesus come I I
[1:28:54] read this the other day. Now remember
[1:28:56] there was many many times in his walk
[1:28:59] with his disciples they called him
[1:29:01] master and they called him lord and he
[1:29:02] said don't call anybody that he said
[1:29:04] don't call me father he said you know he
[1:29:06] said I'm he said you worship god he he
[1:29:08] he kind of diverted but right here
[1:29:10] brother Donnie he's at the end he knows
[1:29:13] that this is fixing to be read and and
[1:29:15] and after he's gone this is going to be
[1:29:18] instituted so he said he said if I then
[1:29:21] your lord and master already told him
[1:29:23] you said it so well for So, so I am. So,
[1:29:27] if I wash your feet, being your Lord and
[1:29:29] Master, you ought also to wash one
[1:29:31] another's feet. For I have given you an
[1:29:32] example, you an example that you should
[1:29:34] do as I have done to you. Very, very I
[1:29:39] say unto you, the servant is not greater
[1:29:41] than his Lord, neither he that sent
[1:29:43] greater than he that sent him. If you
[1:29:45] know these things, say it with me. Happy
[1:29:48] are ye if you do them. Amen. God bless
[1:29:50] you. Let's bow our heads. Heavenly
[1:29:52] Father, be with us, Lord. Take care of
[1:29:54] us.

[1:29:56] Father, and give us give us grace, Lord,
[1:29:58] and help us to um to come up, Lord, and
[1:30:01] and know that we're a child of you and
[1:30:04] know that we have things that we have to
[1:30:06] do. We have positions to take. And
[1:30:08] Father, I pray that we'll get into those
[1:30:10] positions, Father. Just be with the ones
[1:30:12] that are sick, Father. Be the ones that
[1:30:13] are well, Father, that's not here,
[1:30:15] that's traveling. Father, I pray that
[1:30:17] you'd be with them. Father, just bless
[1:30:18] in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you.
