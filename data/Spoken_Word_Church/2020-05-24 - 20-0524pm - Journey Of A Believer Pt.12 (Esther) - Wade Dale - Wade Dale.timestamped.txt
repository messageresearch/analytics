[10:25] turn to the book of Corinthians 1st
[10:27] Corinthians 10 let's just read one
[10:29] scripture get into art we're still in
[10:31] the journey of a Christian our journey
[10:34] of a believer and we're walking now into
[10:38] the book of Esther we went through the
[10:41] Book of Ruth and we now we're in the
[10:43] book of Esther so we're going to speak
[10:45] of a of a little girl that had a very
[10:50] unassuming beginning and then she became
[10:53] one of the most powerful people in the
[10:55] kingdom and then and always remember
[10:58] we'll give you the characters and tell
[11:00] you who they are and what they're doing
[11:02] so let's bow our heads before we get
[11:03] started and speak to the author the
[11:06] Heavenly Father Lord today we are
[11:10] standing here Lord knowing that things
[11:17] are not as they used to be
[11:19] but we know that you never change you're
[11:23] the same yesterday today and forever and
[11:26] Lord you will be our God
[11:31] if will allow you to do that through all
[11:34] this concern and fear that man has we
[11:41] see some people that literally are are
[11:44] shaking in their boots as we always say
[11:47] because they're fearful of this of this
[11:50] virus going around and lord we've taken
[11:54] the position here you know to be
[11:56] cautious but have faith and not have
[12:00] fear to have faith Lord that you'll take
[12:03] care of the ones that Lord faithfully do
[12:07] what you say Lord and not provoke you
[12:10] father we realize that this world has no
[12:14] clue what's going on and they really
[12:18] don't know what roadmap is ahead but
[12:22] Lord you've give us tomorrow's news
[12:25] today we don't have to literally read
[12:29] the newspaper to know what's heading and
[12:32] what's coming and what we're heading
[12:33] into the father it's a great time to be
[12:36] a Christian it's a great time to be Lord
[12:40] held in your arms and let you take care
[12:43] of us as you did through Boaz and Ruth
[12:46] where the great boy I stood and took the
[12:49] shoe off and said I now will take the
[12:51] possession of Naomi's property well Lord
[12:55] we see that happening in the world but
[13:00] we see it happening in our lives our
[13:03] lives are literally being played out
[13:06] through these characters in the Old
[13:09] Testament Lord I pray today that we'll
[13:12] see that in the book of Esther how Lord
[13:14] a little young unassuming girl
[13:17] becomes a mighty queen in a huge Kingdom
[13:21] and Lord we know that his brother
[13:24] they'll read this morning revelations
[13:27] Lord his wife has made herself ready and
[13:30] we're gonna rule and reign on this earth
[13:33] Lord you took us from the sheep coat you
[13:36] took us from a life of sin and despair
[13:38] and you made us Lord the greatest people
[13:42] on the face of the earth the bride of
[13:45] Jesus Christ
[13:47] an eternal bride not just one that's
[13:49] going to be one and past no this is an
[13:51] eternal bride
[13:52] you had us in your mind way before you
[13:56] said let there be light and Lord I pray
[13:59] today that you'll come down among us in
[14:01] a special way to today Lord and manifest
[14:04] yourself among us by the opening of the
[14:06] word father give us this day our daily
[14:08] bread we've truly assembled to hear from
[14:12] you Father so I pray that you be the one
[14:14] that does the speaking you'd be the one
[14:17] that does the revealing and you'd be the
[14:20] one Lord that takes over this service we
[14:22] ask in Jesus name Amen
[14:25] first Corinthians 10 let's read just the
[14:27] last verse we know that Moses and all
[14:29] went through the different things and
[14:30] how that God's telling us that
[14:32] everything they did was for an example I
[14:34] mean yeah I was thinking the other day
[14:36] we didn't go through this too much but
[14:38] you know when Moses when they when they
[14:40] had their wife what they had their
[14:42] Passover they clearly killed the lamb
[14:45] and then they left Egypt right well
[14:48] what's the first thing that come to
[14:49] water water they were baptized they went
[14:55] through the Red Sea in type come out on
[14:59] the other side and here's Miriam having
[15:01] a Pentecostal revival and in here here
[15:04] they got to go through 40 years of the
[15:05] wilderness of what it's kind of weird
[15:08] that that wilderness was named the
[15:09] wilderness of sin 40 years they wander
[15:12] through the wilderness same just like me
[15:15] and you what for sanctification to get
[15:17] rid of all the old ideas that they had
[15:20] the old fighters the old ones remember
[15:22] they all died in the wilderness all the
[15:24] old ones there and then God raised up a
[15:26] new group to do what to be circumsized
[15:30] and then go over into the promised land
[15:32] so we love that that you keep even
[15:35] seeing more and more even you you preach
[15:37] on it your study on it and I brother
[15:39] Dale does all of you should do the same
[15:40] thing you should read the Bible and then
[15:42] go man I didn't see that who added that
[15:45] because it wasn't there the last time I
[15:47] read it six weeks ago you know what it
[15:50] was it wasn't your time to see that
[15:53] piece of the puzzle but now we come we
[15:56] see when we see when we see the puzzle
[15:59] we see that there's what some pieces
[16:01] missing maybe back through time but
[16:03] today we got all the pieces and we even
[16:07] saw the picture on the box before we
[16:10] even started getting the puzzle put
[16:11] together so we know what it looks like
[16:13] we know it like I said before
[16:15] everybody's it's kind of funny in a way
[16:18] but it's not all the whole world is
[16:21] talking about Antichrist Antichrist
[16:23] answer and they're making it a chip and
[16:25] they're making it a you got to go get
[16:27] tested and they're putting a chip in
[16:29] your body and that's the Antichrist and
[16:30] Bill Gates is the Antichrist and Donald
[16:33] Trump the Antichrist and this was the
[16:35] Antichrist net they miss the whole thing
[16:37] and here we are here we are listening to
[16:42] all that going no no that's not what it
[16:48] is
[16:49] thank God he sent us a prophet a man
[16:53] that told us he said he said don't fear
[16:57] communism but watch it don't fear will
[17:00] Russia but watch it we saw the other day
[17:03] yesterday I think to come through the
[17:04] through the email that that brother
[17:07] Ernie sent sends us did y'all get that
[17:10] where Russia is condemning brother
[17:11] branham's books and kicking them out of
[17:13] the country
[17:15] somebody must have got one of them but
[17:17] where brother Burman said watch Russia
[17:19] watch the bear she's not dead she's just
[17:22] sleeping and when Russia comes down for
[17:25] the oil and Russian soldiers walking the
[17:28] streets of America somebody must have
[17:29] found that out and heard that and said I
[17:31] don't want that in our country no more
[17:33] but see even that's not the Antichrist
[17:36] the Antichrist is a system that we're
[17:38] already in here we're not in it but
[17:42] we're around it so it's just you watch
[17:46] people and you think man thank God for a
[17:49] direction that we have gods give us a
[17:53] direction through a prophet through the
[17:55] Holy Ghost through the Word of God that
[17:57] our puzzle looks much different than the
[17:59] world's puzzle and you know what that's
[18:01] gonna do that's gonna separate us and
[18:02] that's what's gonna get us in trouble
[18:04] with the regular world cuz regular
[18:06] world's going old that's the antic no no
[18:09] you look at that he says who's the
[18:11] Antichrist the Roman Catholic Church and
[18:13] the system and she had daughters so
[18:17] don't worry don't forget about the
[18:18] daughters in that system so so let's not
[18:21] I'm not making a joke but you look at
[18:24] the people running wild with all these
[18:26] different things and we know you just
[18:29] step back and go than in it it's got
[18:33] everybody fooled except the bride
[18:36] everybody every system its fooled except
[18:40] the bride of Jesus Christ amen
[18:43] so thank God again not for just bringing
[18:46] only his word but for sending us a
[18:48] Mordecai a little man a prophet because
[18:51] you're gonna see this Mordecai
[18:52] step on the scene and he's going to take
[18:54] this Hadassah our Esther and he's gonna
[18:57] lead her and guide her into being a
[19:00] queen and I love this story the book of
[19:03] Esther just really full of really good
[19:05] things so let's read the last verse 11
[19:09] if you don't mind
[19:10] whew now all these things happen under
[19:14] them for examples and they are written
[19:15] for our admonition upon whom the ends of
[19:18] the world are come that's us
[19:20] that wasn't even that was that was Paul
[19:24] writing 2000 years ago it wasn't to him
[19:29] he wrote that prophetically for me and
[19:32] you because here we are this is we are
[19:35] the they are written for our admonition
[19:37] upon whom the ends of the world to come
[19:39] you may be seated in the Lord at his
[19:41] blessing to the reading of the word and
[19:45] I was we were talking in the Bible study
[19:47] this morning our Sunday School class
[19:48] this morning where we we see that
[19:51] there's um
[19:54] there's three stages to the new birth we
[19:57] know that but then that's not all there
[20:00] is to it
[20:02] we see that even with everyone every
[20:06] type we see of the baptism of the Holy
[20:08] Ghost even with Abraham coming to what
[20:12] Abraham coming to a type by the
[20:15] circumcision by his faith in what God
[20:17] said
[20:18] remember he continued on and had to take
[20:21] a child that he had born and had to take
[20:24] him up on a mountain and God tested his
[20:26] faith and then the same way with Ruth
[20:29] Ruth comes to a place of resting less
[20:31] Boaz does to do the work for and then
[20:34] all of a sudden what happens to them
[20:35] they go forward in their revelation and
[20:38] have a child then end the story right
[20:41] then it ended the story comes when they
[20:43] have the child when there's a conception
[20:45] when you keep on going when Abraham has
[20:47] the promised child you understand what
[20:49] I'm saying you and I are not
[20:51] commissioned to say we were talking this
[20:53] morning about revelations 3:14 we were
[20:57] counseled to by I said we're counseled
[20:59] to do all these things in the end time
[21:01] that they weren't they didn't have to do
[21:03] in the first stage second days third age
[21:05] fourth fifth six days but in this age
[21:07] were required to go to full adoption we
[21:11] required to as brother Dale was talking
[21:13] about the son of man is is him that was
[21:17] God in human flesh there's your
[21:18] headstone the person of Jesus Christ now
[21:22] when he comes back in the end time he's
[21:24] not going to be in a physical body one
[21:27] he's going to be in him
[21:29] yester a many membered bride that has
[21:32] you'll see in a little while that Esther
[21:35] comes from just a poor old child to
[21:37] where she gets full authority in the
[21:39] kingdom she marries the king and he she
[21:43] tells him what to do basically not and
[21:45] you understand what I'm saying we don't
[21:46] tell god what to do but we are part of
[21:49] the plan
[21:50] and God don't mind if we remind him of
[21:52] the plan and then so he doesn't remind
[21:55] if we do that I love what brother Brown
[21:57] said he said that God doesn't mind you
[21:59] reminding him of what he's already said
[22:01] and man so you remind God how many of
[22:05] you I do
[22:06] remind God I said look God you promised
[22:08] I'd have my children you promised me
[22:11] that whatever your whatever situation
[22:15] you're in you promised me that and that
[22:17] God's not going well I don't I resent
[22:21] that God don't resent that God loves for
[22:22] you to say that because you're just
[22:24] telling him back what he's already said
[22:25] and one day we'll get a revelation of it
[22:28] and it'll become he'll come to fruition
[22:32] so let's look at now as the journey of
[22:35] Abraham the point we were making this
[22:36] morning is it's okay to be it's fine to
[22:40] be born again and have them have the
[22:42] baptism of the Holy Ghost and be and you
[22:43] be a Christian but it's like even in
[22:47] even in regular life if you it's
[22:50] wonderful to to have a child and and
[22:53] there's a little Chloe sitting there you
[22:55] know laying there she's about the guns
[22:57] leave no she's not
[22:59] she got thumbing her mouth but she's a
[23:02] beautiful little girl but you know the
[23:04] conception and the birth was just the
[23:08] beginning of her life wasn't the end
[23:11] it's the beginning you got feed her
[23:14] she's sucking her thumb now she's
[23:15] getting a little bit extra nutrition but
[23:17] some dirt and some or whatever else
[23:20] she'd been playing with but you say
[23:22] that's the way God is with us
[23:23] he doesn't want just oh I have this
[23:26] wonderful baby now I'm gonna go and I'm
[23:29] gonna put it in a room and I'm it's so
[23:32] beautiful I'm gonna leave it in that
[23:33] room I'm not going to touch it like
[23:35] dad's always said that many times he
[23:37] looks on the wall and sees us in
[23:38] different stages of development and he
[23:40] wants you know why wish they would no
[23:42] you can't do that to a grunt to a person
[23:45] we're supposed to come on this earth and
[23:47] grow alright so same way we'll be in the
[23:50] Christian and you can't grow without
[23:52] being a born again born again Christian
[23:57] then the feeding begins then what test
[24:01] becomes four testimonies then the things
[24:04] in our life our journey just begins at
[24:08] the new birth same way with a lot
[24:11] Abraham Abraham now remember his journey
[24:13] started from and went through
[24:15] justification sanctification and you got
[24:17] to see that in your life
[24:19] I say it again if you can't see that in
[24:22] your life then I journey you to start
[24:24] over not gonna hurt a thing start over
[24:28] thought over go to justification to say
[24:31] God forgive me of my past sin go to the
[24:36] water repent and be baptized in the name
[24:41] of Jesus Christ for the remission of
[24:42] your sins and you shall receive the gift
[24:46] of the holy Oh promise sanctification
[24:50] because many times we look come on you
[24:54] know you you talk to people out in the
[24:57] world I said well I quit this quickly I
[24:59] quit this quit back with this even
[25:01] message people well I know I'm born
[25:03] again I cuz I quit smoking no I don't
[25:05] mean it that means that you may have got
[25:07] sanctified and you started coming to
[25:10] church and that unclean spirits driven
[25:11] out of you but what do you fall out what
[25:15] do you fishing get full up again because
[25:17] remember it's still open the same one
[25:20] can come back in what waters good and
[25:23] make you what a believer but it will be
[25:29] a mate believer no it's true believer as
[25:33] we look about this morning just to I
[25:36] want to really get into we're going to
[25:38] get into the book of Esther really good
[25:40] but I want you to keep getting what's
[25:42] going on here there has to be a growth
[25:46] stage and every one of us there has to
[25:50] be and you've got to identify that you
[25:53] are in that growth stage not that you're
[25:57] just I'm born again I saw you know I I
[26:00] pressed I mash the button and there God
[26:03] speaking to me through William Branham
[26:05] that's okay folks let me tell you how
[26:08] let me tell you how deceiving it is just
[26:12] like I've told you many times before the
[26:15] devil is one person right he is a
[26:18] literal person he's not some goofy
[26:20] spirit he's a person anointed cherub God
[26:23] made him to be his right-hand man he has
[26:26] never talked to three people in heaven
[26:31] he stopped the one person he knows
[26:35] there's one God because he talks to him
[26:36] all the time but then he turns around
[26:39] and he says oh there's three you see how
[26:44] deceiving that is the very man that's
[26:47] deceiving you the worst deceivers a man
[26:50] in those 99 percent of the truth of
[26:51] somebody or something right because he
[26:54] knows just enough to get you drawn in
[26:57] because look God never in his life ever
[27:04] was three people but Satan decides to
[27:09] come down to earth at Nicaea into Dark
[27:11] Ages and he gets inside people's brains
[27:13] and tells them why he must be a light
[27:19] substance there must be three people
[27:21] because it was God taught son talking to
[27:24] if you see what I mean he was reasoning
[27:26] same thing happens now so Satan's not
[27:28] this person is going to tell you hey
[27:31] listen let's don't go to church let's oh
[27:33] no that's probably you most of the time
[27:39] but the devil take you go to church but
[27:43] but don't believe what's going on or or
[27:45] wish you or somewhere else or sit there
[27:47] and fill your mind full of all these
[27:48] other things and I really don't know why
[27:49] I'm saying this today but maybe I'm
[27:50] saying it for somebody but that's our
[27:52] problem that's our issue that's why we
[27:54] that's why the children of Israel were
[27:57] 40 years in the wilderness of sin they
[28:01] were not but just a few miles miles
[28:05] miles from the promised land brother
[28:07] Brown said would twelve days make
[28:09] journey or something but not just a few
[28:11] days and two million people they weren't
[28:16] just a little group you walk two million
[28:20] people and listen you got to have cattle
[28:22] goats sheep lambs provisions something
[28:28] for bread water all that so you've got
[28:31] this you look out in this field and you
[28:33] put two million people well two million
[28:36] people maybe a mile long and a mile wide
[28:40] so they literally had to walk in circles
[28:43] around the promised land and have to be
[28:46] looking down and seeing their their shoe
[28:48] prints from about two or three years ago
[28:50] you understand what I'm saying and
[28:52] that's the way we've been we've been
[28:55] falsely taught not by message I'm
[28:57] talking about out in the world and then
[28:59] you come into the message of the hour
[29:00] and you know what who came with you
[29:02] Satan came right with you Satan came
[29:06] right with you come right in here and he
[29:07] set down in the message Church and he
[29:09] said you're fine you listen to tapes
[29:12] don't you okay what are you doing about
[29:16] it what's your life are you able to take
[29:19] what you've got and put it in these
[29:23] people's walk in life are you able to
[29:28] say that I once was a Ruth and then I
[29:33] had to make a decision I had to make a
[29:36] decision to go with Naomi I had to make
[29:39] a decision to go to a place that wasn't
[29:42] mine to go to a place you know our we
[29:45] all and here's our biggest problem with
[29:48] this coronavirus it's got us out of our
[29:50] comfort zone hey man yeah go ahead
[29:55] please say yes yes Tony you can even
[29:59] Amen that get us out it's got us out of
[30:05] our comfort zone I'm asked what he's
[30:07] done so what is what's God doing
[30:10] I hope he's getting us out of our
[30:13] comfort zone
[30:14] because the devil wants you to be lazy
[30:18] easy lay out a seal rich have needed
[30:22] nothing naked blind wretched miserable
[30:24] and don't know it
[30:26] I want us to know it I want us to know I
[30:30] was telling somebody yesterday we're
[30:32] talking I think me and Jim was talking
[30:33] about something I said you know it's it
[30:37] this thing that's happened is what God
[30:41] allowed to happen we know that and he
[30:43] did it to what try us to see where we be
[30:47] in the faith or not all right
[30:48] so and not I'm just not saying here in
[30:51] this building or downstairs but you're
[30:53] gonna see a great shaking that's going
[30:55] to show every time something shakes
[30:56] something
[30:57] fouled off and then every time something
[31:00] shake something falls off so God's just
[31:02] going to keep shaking they're just going
[31:03] to keep falling keep shaking they're
[31:05] gonna keep falling but the bride will
[31:07] never fall she can't fall
[31:10] she can't fail she's anointed to make
[31:15] the journey just like Caleb taught the
[31:18] endtime bride right Caleb taught the
[31:20] bride
[31:21] Caleb stood there forty years later and
[31:23] said I'm just as strong now as I was 40
[31:25] years ago and God honored his faith by
[31:28] giving him a mountain God will honor
[31:32] your faith in your journey some ways
[31:35] gonna give you a mountain and that
[31:37] mountain is the statue of a perfect man
[31:40] and on top of that mountain is where you
[31:43] gonna have victory on top of that
[31:46] mountain that's where you gonna meet
[31:47] that man on top of the mountains where
[31:50] you're gonna see that you are part of
[31:52] this son of man I don't say movement
[31:55] because it's not a movement a movement
[31:57] is something that moves and goes away
[31:59] this don't go away
[32:00] this this is gonna move us into a body
[32:03] change hey man the baptism of the Holy
[32:05] Ghost the baptism of the Holy Ghost is
[32:08] great to have but we gotta have plus in
[32:11] this inten time it's required it's
[32:15] required that we have not something
[32:17] different but we are different we have
[32:21] promises in here that a lot of people
[32:24] don't have so that does make us
[32:27] different I like brother Brian said he
[32:28] said I hate to say it he said but God's
[32:30] a segregationist he don't want you to
[32:33] mingle with the world out there he don't
[32:35] want you to do that he wants you to what
[32:37] why do you tell Israel hey marrying your
[32:41] own people don't go outside why he was
[32:44] saying that naturally for them but also
[32:46] saying that spiritually for you and I
[32:48] don't go out and mingle and go get these
[32:50] different things out in the world cuz
[32:52] you got to bring a lot of things in
[32:53] maybe sometimes that you really didn't
[32:55] see while you're in the journey and
[32:59] while these people didn't see but as we
[33:01] go through this journey I want everyone
[33:02] one of you to see where you're at right
[33:05] now
[33:06] that's why I'm doing this journey of a
[33:09] believer not a journey of an unbeliever
[33:11] it's a journey of a believer somebody
[33:15] that believes and if we believe then we
[33:17] must believe on to the end it doesn't
[33:20] matter if you file if you if you go by
[33:22] the grave like brother Collins the other
[33:27] day what a wonderful thing what a
[33:29] wonderful testimony you say oh he's no
[33:34] he died no he's not he's more alive now
[33:37] than he ever has been he don't have to
[33:40] get up in the morning go light bill
[33:43] phone bill God take care of this got
[33:47] taken oh he's over there going oh god
[33:50] bless you brother branham I told him
[33:52] other day I said he was she said his
[33:55] wife said he was you know listening to a
[33:57] lot of tapes said he loved that voice he
[34:01] didn't hear a voice on the tape that
[34:02] morning he heard the real man I'll get
[34:09] cuz you know what you're gathered with
[34:10] your people right
[34:12] he was gathered with brother Branham and
[34:14] brother mote and all the different ones
[34:16] here brother Tatum and all them brother
[34:18] Gary and some of the ones I'm saying
[34:19] someone's he's really knew very well and
[34:21] then there's brother Branham and I bet
[34:23] you he just if he could have cried he
[34:25] would have cried but he did and he
[34:26] couldn't cry but he was so happy to see
[34:29] the guy that he had listened to all his
[34:32] life he could finally see that person
[34:35] now show me where sadness comes in that
[34:37] Oh departure and we know all that is sad
[34:41] but mine didn't know what we're living
[34:43] for and I'm not just living to see
[34:47] William Branham I'm living to see Jesus
[34:49] Christ but you know we don't literally
[34:51] see him though not yet not till the
[34:54] resurrection not till we meet him in the
[34:56] air so we're going to see brother
[34:58] Branham and all these different people
[34:59] that's went on brother Tommen and and
[35:01] all the ones just went on we're gonna
[35:03] see them first then we're gonna rejoice
[35:06] and then we're gonna meet Jesus in the
[35:09] air the one that made all this come
[35:12] about see you keep that in your mind as
[35:14] we go through this and we look in the
[35:17] roof let's pull this back up just a
[35:19] minute because we know that
[35:23] and I'm not I don't want anybody say
[35:26] well you're saying you're belittling the
[35:28] Holy Ghost no you got to have the whole
[35:29] ago but that's the beginning of your
[35:31] journey it's not the end that's the
[35:34] beginning if you're still alive
[35:36] that's the beginning of your journey I
[35:38] don't care how old you are what a great
[35:40] thing brother Adam walks across the
[35:42] curtain of time he sees this 18 year old
[35:44] girl run up and hug his neck and say oh
[35:46] my precious brother and then runs off
[35:48] and the angel now watch the angel there
[35:50] was a lot of people did that but that
[35:51] angel said did you recognize her he was
[35:55] making a point he's making a point
[35:58] he said you recognize her he said never
[36:01] seen her before in my life in other
[36:02] words the angel said yeah you did
[36:05] said she was 92 years old when she came
[36:08] to the Lord and got saved in your
[36:10] meeting and no and then brother Graham
[36:12] said no wonder she said my precious
[36:14] brother and she was so happy live 92
[36:16] years in the world of sin and then come
[36:18] now the Prophet didn't save her let's
[36:20] get that the Prophet didn't save her but
[36:23] he brought her to Christ and Christ
[36:25] saved her and by that he met her over
[36:28] there on the other side and there was
[36:29] the fruit of what brother Baumann is and
[36:32] I believe brother Brown was like man
[36:33] what am I scared of now why would I be
[36:36] scared and here we are 18 years old and
[36:39] and all these people he said millions of
[36:41] people are saved under his ministry and
[36:44] we know that because it keeps it keeps
[36:45] happening it keeps happening it keeps
[36:47] happening wherever that black is it
[36:48] keeps happening keeps happening keeps
[36:50] happening this journey is not over yet
[36:53] but it's getting close so the journey
[36:56] the journey though is in four parts we
[36:59] have four parts of our journey to come
[37:02] to justification sanctification baptism
[37:04] the Holy Ghost and placing our adoption
[37:06] are being rewarded amen so let's just
[37:11] don't say I'm born again no listen when
[37:14] I got born again that's just when the
[37:16] fight began it's been a fight the whole
[37:20] time but you know what the battles are a
[37:23] lot easier just like this battle that
[37:27] the world's fighting with this virus I'm
[37:29] not fighting that battle I'm not
[37:33] fighting that battle but Don yeah what
[37:35] battle that's right the
[37:36] petals inside here I want to get that
[37:39] coronavirus I love this thing right up
[37:40] here I ain't worried about to get you
[37:41] down here I'm worried about getting it
[37:43] up here Satan puts the virus then where
[37:46] does it go don't go down here goes up
[37:48] here in a Christian can't get in the
[37:50] can't get the soul can't bother the soul
[37:51] of an individual but he sure can't get
[37:53] in that brain but see we're coming
[37:57] though to a placing or adoption where
[37:59] we're brother Brahim said Jesus didn't
[38:02] didn't in other words he didn't have to
[38:03] get up every morning and say I got to be
[38:04] God I gotta act like God I'm Jesus I got
[38:06] act like him
[38:07] no he just acted this life out that's
[38:12] the same way with you and I don't make
[38:14] yourself odd if you walk like this
[38:16] you'll automatically be on to the world
[38:20] were the artist people that ever lived
[38:22] on the face of the earth thank God
[38:26] they call Jesus the devil they did
[38:31] remember I called him belzebub you know
[38:33] why cuz he didn't come the way they
[38:35] thought he should come they didn't come
[38:38] he didn't come the way that they came
[38:40] because he they had a religion they had
[38:43] a covering they had a denominational
[38:45] idea that was different from what God or
[38:49] Jesus Christ so the journey of Ruth
[38:51] journey of Abraham has four parts
[38:53] justifications that case of baptism Holy
[38:55] Ghost and placing or adoption and then
[38:58] we looked at the four combat beasts the
[38:59] lion ox man and eagle now look you and I
[39:01] are in the Eagle anointing but that
[39:04] doesn't mean that the lineart Sandman is
[39:06] not there that's that just shows us the
[39:08] whole complete plan of redemption the
[39:09] whole complete plan of us nobody got
[39:13] that we still need the bonus of the line
[39:16] brother Brown said and he said that same
[39:18] that ox was in what the Dark Ages he
[39:21] said the same spirit they had to make it
[39:25] through that dark ages now watch this he
[39:28] said that same spirit they had that sent
[39:30] them into the lion's den and was able to
[39:32] take that spirit of the age you have to
[39:36] use every day to get through your day
[39:41] you have to use that what sacrificial ox
[39:45] anointing some I've been in this message
[39:47] for 40 years same
[39:50] and then the intelligence of the man and
[39:55] then the Eagle anointing is where it
[39:57] goes up higher so we can see these
[40:00] things in the Bible and see these things
[40:02] in your walk of your life that you can
[40:05] say that happened to me that's my
[40:09] journey that's my part of life so let's
[40:13] go on up a little bit more to Ruth we
[40:15] knew that the four characters in Ruth
[40:17] because I want you to keep going back to
[40:18] Ruth a little bit just scroll it up to
[40:20] the next next slide there please where
[40:25] Ruth we you had Naomi which was the type
[40:27] of the old Jewish church and we saw all
[40:28] this or four top of the denominational
[40:31] Church because remember she was with
[40:33] Naomi but she decided to go back all
[40:37] right she didn't want to take a further
[40:38] one of the word you're gonna see
[40:39] somebody else do the same thing in
[40:41] Esther Ruth there's your Gentile bride
[40:44] because remember everything she done was
[40:47] service servant she listened she
[40:50] listened to Naomi she listened to that
[40:53] old Jewish Church because it old Jewish
[40:56] Church knew what she knew the ways of
[40:58] the Jews Ruth did not she wasn't married
[41:02] long force for her husband's died so she
[41:04] couldn't learn so she had to learn from
[41:05] mama churches all right everybody got
[41:07] that
[41:07] and then Boaz absolutely topped Christ
[41:09] and we saw all the things that happened
[41:11] there so now let's go to the book of
[41:14] Esther we're not going to deal with the
[41:16] Book of Numbers I still think it's just
[41:18] a beautiful picture though talking about
[41:22] the Book of Numbers and Joshua about how
[41:24] that two tribes and a half tribe stayed
[41:26] on one side of Jordan and they and then
[41:29] the other half tribe went across and
[41:31] then they were placed over there it's
[41:32] just that to me it's just a beautiful
[41:34] beautiful journey all right so let's get
[41:36] this straight before we get started
[41:37] we'll start right here we're going to go
[41:39] verse by verse up until probably the
[41:42] second chapter and then we'll stop right
[41:44] there so we won't be very long now
[41:46] remember as we go through the book of
[41:48] Esther the book of Esther the name of
[41:51] God doesn't occur one time all right but
[41:55] in no other book I'm reading the
[41:57] commentary of Scofield but in no other
[42:00] book of the Bible is His Providence more
[42:03] conspicuous
[42:04] why because you got a girl that said you
[42:08] but she's not letting everybody know
[42:10] that but then you've got a king that's
[42:13] king over I'm talking about maybe
[42:16] two-thirds of the whole landmass of the
[42:19] world he's the king over all right
[42:22] and there's this guy comes in named
[42:25] Haman and he's wanting to kill all the
[42:27] Jews he doesn't know Hadassah or Esther
[42:32] is Jew yet that revealed that to him yet
[42:35] so he just claimed he just says hey
[42:38] Haman Haman paints such a bad picture
[42:41] the guy says okay get rid of them and
[42:44] then extra finds out Mordechai finds out
[42:46] extra finds out about it and they're
[42:49] like in total distress because they're
[42:51] fixing to get destroyed this Kings got
[42:53] armies by the millions right so here's
[42:57] the story same thing with you and now
[42:58] this world looks pretty bleak but you
[43:00] know what the only settlement salvation
[43:01] and saving grace is through the bride of
[43:03] Jesus Christ I'm sorry but I didn't play
[43:08] this thing out God did and this is the
[43:09] way it is all right the only salvation
[43:12] is is through a five fold ministry that
[43:15] are born again that preaches the Word of
[43:17] God to you and you respond and receive
[43:20] it and then act on it that's just the
[43:23] way it is I love it that way cuz it's
[43:26] simple that's real simple but after then
[43:30] we're going to look at the king king of
[43:32] Soros I looked at we looked up the
[43:39] definition of his name and there is not
[43:42] one it's just a question mark if you
[43:46] look in your Hebrew lexicon it's just a
[43:48] question mark they don't even know where
[43:49] this guy he's the greatest King and ever
[43:51] lived but they don't know him by name
[43:53] hello somebody okay but we do so the
[43:58] king is the king Esther is the type of
[44:00] the bride vastaa is a type of the old
[44:04] denominational Church and Mordecai we
[44:08] know even more to come means little man
[44:11] so he will be the Prophet that's going
[44:14] to be in the background and he's going
[44:16] to be telling the
[44:18] ride our Esther what to do right there I
[44:22] got that say man wake up I hope we start
[44:31] having a revival of staying awake I'm
[44:37] telling ya it's just a charge to see
[44:40] everybody back in church it is a charge
[44:44] to me but some people you know I
[44:47] preached on revival the other day I was
[44:48] telling them downstairs you know it's
[44:50] gonna say it's sad because it's an
[44:52] individual revival it's not one it's not
[44:54] the whole church is gonna sure we're all
[44:56] happy to be here but you're gonna fall
[44:58] in a revival of your own and we see it
[45:02] more now social distancing and they want
[45:05] you to stay away from everybody well you
[45:07] can have your own revival Amen you can
[45:11] have a one-man revival or one sister
[45:13] revival because God never promised
[45:18] anything about him distancing himself
[45:21] from you amen
[45:23] so he'll be right there with you but we
[45:25] see that Haman when Haman comes in it's
[45:27] going to be interesting even the lineage
[45:30] of these people I went through a lot of
[45:33] the history on this and that's why I
[45:34] don't want to bore you but it's a
[45:36] beautiful picture to me you can read it
[45:38] for yourself or you can look up some of
[45:40] these words some of the words are just
[45:42] so fitting for the day and and the King
[45:47] even a source
[45:48] he has no meaning to his name we look at
[45:54] Esther we know that her name original
[45:56] her name was Hadassah because that's her
[45:58] Jewish name and then her name had to be
[46:00] changed to Esther I love somebody that
[46:03] style we know last time means beautiful
[46:07] backs they what nothing she's a pretty
[46:11] church John admired her in revelations
[46:14] chapter 17 and man we'll get into that
[46:17] right here real quick and then Mordecai
[46:19] means little man about five six and
[46:25] Haman is a direct descendant if you take
[46:28] his lineage back he's from the
[46:30] Amalekites
[46:31] what God say to do the Amalekites kill
[46:34] them all amen because what did what did
[46:37] Emily do they wouldn't let Israel pass
[46:39] through the land and God said no I gotta
[46:42] know more these people they're not even
[46:44] going to be entered into the lineage of
[46:45] of the righteous but they got in the
[46:48] lineage of this guy named Haman so we'll
[46:50] get to it and just the second fuel mine
[46:51] we'll go through the first chapter set
[46:53] the stage so now watch the story
[47:01] continues as Jerusalem was dispersed
[47:09] right before this time and a mere
[47:14] remnant went to Jerusalem this certain
[47:16] amount went to Jerusalem but a lot of
[47:18] them stayed because they were lazing and
[47:22] here's the the commentary says the mass
[47:24] of the nation preferred the easy and
[47:27] lucrative life under the Persian rule
[47:30] that's not a lot layout to see a lot of
[47:34] a state and Laodicea where we live here
[47:37] but we're gonna see though that God
[47:39] didn't forsake them just like God's not
[47:41] gonna forsake us
[47:42] he puts all these players right in to
[47:44] the to the world not of the world but in
[47:47] the world
[47:48] he puts Esther and Mordecai all these
[47:52] different ones that you're gonna see he
[47:54] puts them in there with the Jews
[47:57] basically to save them because that they
[47:59] still have every year it's called the
[48:02] day of Purim and and they celebrate in
[48:06] Israel that they appear iam is the day
[48:08] it's kinda like our Independence Day
[48:10] that's the day that they celebrate
[48:13] because they would have been wiped out
[48:14] on that day there was a battle and if
[48:16] they hadn't defended their self they
[48:18] would have been wiped out but you know
[48:20] what God's not gonna let them get wiped
[48:21] out just like the bride you're gonna see
[48:23] us and we're it we're this great big
[48:24] number and then we're gonna dwindle down
[48:26] a little bit and all these different
[48:27] things are gonna happen but you know
[48:29] what it doesn't matter if it comes down
[48:30] to one God's gonna have a bride
[48:35] one um average one you can decide
[48:38] whether it's you or not so let's go now
[48:41] through the book of Esther and let's
[48:42] remember Esther types the bride the king
[48:44] is going to he's the greatest King that
[48:46] ever lived at that moment King the
[48:49] source then you've got backstop which is
[48:51] his wife at the time of the story got it
[48:56] she's the queen she's the first one then
[49:01] we're gonna see a guy named Mordecai
[49:02] come in a little bit later but watch how
[49:05] this sets up now it came to pass in the
[49:08] days of a source that is a source which
[49:11] range from India
[49:14] alright go look in your map all the way
[49:17] India is a close to China all the way to
[49:19] Ethiopia which is over there in Africa
[49:22] is in the top of Ethiopia so it was all
[49:25] that Kingdom all across the Middle East
[49:27] Middle East and all the way over into
[49:29] India over a hundred and seven twenty
[49:32] seven provinces so this King was not
[49:35] just a king that was sitting on a throne
[49:38] and he had three or four subjects no
[49:41] this guy had we're gonna see he's got
[49:42] Chamberlain he's got he's got people
[49:46] that are and actually what what gets me
[49:49] is is he's got princes and Chamberlain's
[49:52] and this seven of them seven is so
[49:56] prevalent in this scripture that you
[49:57] it's just not odd it's God God did this
[50:02] God wrote this God made this come to
[50:05] pass
[50:05] alright so now let's watch these that in
[50:07] those days when the king of Saurus sat
[50:11] on the throne of his kingdom which was
[50:13] in Shushan the palace in the third year
[50:16] of his reign he made a feast unto all
[50:17] the princes and his servants so it's in
[50:21] the third year of his reign alright
[50:24] third year of his reign the power of
[50:30] Persia Medea the nobles and princes of
[50:33] the provinces being performed in other
[50:37] words he said I'm gonna have this feast
[50:38] and I'm going to bring all my noble
[50:40] people in all the people of renown I'm
[50:43] going to bring them in and we're gonna
[50:45] have this feast and what does the feast
[50:48] do that mean
[50:49] you eat so what am I saying the king
[50:53] told us if you want to have a feast
[50:56] we're gonna have one on Wednesday night
[51:00] at 7 o'clock we're gonna have one Sunday
[51:04] morning at 10:00 and Sunday morning at
[51:06] 2:00 whether you sleep through them or
[51:09] not but that's what the Kings saying
[51:13] he's look I want to show you I want to
[51:15] show you what I got King Jesus wants to
[51:19] show you what he's got he's not a
[51:22] bragger though we brag on him but he's
[51:25] not a bragger he wants to show you what
[51:27] you already got he wants to bring you
[51:29] into this Kingdom when he showed the
[51:31] riches of his glorious kingdom is that
[51:33] not what he's doing now he's showing us
[51:35] the riches of his kingdom by what by
[51:39] Scripture and by somebody by revelation
[51:41] bringing something to you even by
[51:44] reading the wonderful Psalm that you
[51:46] read today that was perfect for the time
[51:49] when he showed the riches of his
[51:51] glorious Kingdom and the honor of his
[51:53] excellent majesty many days even 104
[51:58] score 160 days that's almost half a year
[52:02] and when these days were expired the
[52:05] King made a feast unto all the people
[52:10] now not just the dignitaries now
[52:13] everybody laity the one that you may
[52:18] think you're a fingernail I'm a dorm out
[52:21] in the house of God God doesn't forget
[52:23] you he made a feast unto all the people
[52:26] that were present and sheesh on the
[52:28] palace both unto great and small seven
[52:33] days in the court of the garden of the
[52:37] king's palace seven church ages he's
[52:40] called the great and the small to this
[52:43] feast where were white green blue
[52:47] hangings fashioned with cords of fine
[52:48] linen and purple silver rings pillars of
[52:51] marble the beds were of gold silver upon
[52:54] a pavement of red and blue and white and
[52:56] black and marble this wasn't just a
[52:59] plain meeting and when they gave them
[53:02] drink
[53:02] in vessels of gold the vessels being
[53:05] diverse one from another aren't you a
[53:10] vessel of gold aren't you diverse one
[53:13] from the other
[53:13] aren't you different a little bit
[53:15] different diverse one from another and
[53:17] royal wine what he's going to fill these
[53:19] vessels he's going to fill these diverse
[53:24] vessels with the Holy Ghost or with the
[53:27] wine royal wine in abundance not just
[53:31] give you a little dribble no you're
[53:34] gonna drink - you're drunk my brother
[53:39] Joel said get drunk on the Holy Ghost
[53:40] one time it'll be a lot different than
[53:42] getting drunk all the way and the
[53:45] drinking was according to the law none
[53:47] did compel for so the king had appointed
[53:49] to all the officers of his house that
[53:51] they should do according to every man's
[53:52] pleasure so the King has invited
[53:55] everyone to this great feast not a
[53:59] person left out he's invited everybody
[54:03] but he had a queen at the time and this
[54:08] Queen at the time decided to have her
[54:11] own denomination and bash die now
[54:17] beautiful she wasn't ugly she's
[54:19] beautiful
[54:20] oh nice to look upon the king the king
[54:23] at one time probably loved her but it's
[54:27] what she did it's what caused him to
[54:29] turn away from her and also Vashti the
[54:32] Queen made a feast room for the churches
[54:37] in the royal house which belong to king
[54:41] of source in other words she went right
[54:42] in and said I don't want to have
[54:44] anything to do with your feast I'm
[54:46] quoting brother Branham actually I don't
[54:49] have anything to do with your feast I'm
[54:51] gonna have my own I don't like what
[54:53] you're doing in other words I'm gonna do
[54:55] it my way but watch on the seventh day
[55:00] when the heart of the king was married
[55:02] with one he commanded now here is seven
[55:05] people may man Vista harbona Victor a
[55:11] began a bagasse de zefr and look at
[55:16] number seven
[55:18] carcass Matthew 24 28 that's where the
[55:28] carcass is there's Willy Eagle to be
[55:31] gether funny that it's number 7 not 4 3
[55:36] 6 7 and they were 7 Chamberlain's or
[55:41] eunuchs that served in the presence of a
[55:45] source the king in other words they had
[55:46] no other work about them except the king
[55:52] got it now carcass if you look at the
[55:57] word carcass it means the covering of a
[56:00] lamb Wow how about that but now what he
[56:04] done is he commanded these people that
[56:10] served in the presence of a sorcerer
[56:11] King to bring vast on now he's telling
[56:13] these seven people I want to see my wife
[56:19] to bring vast I'm the queen before the
[56:22] king with the crown royal to show the
[56:24] people and the princes her beauty he was
[56:26] getting ready to present her to the
[56:29] world Baptist Methodist Pentecostal
[56:36] randomise if you're not born again
[56:40] whatever you want to say we can become
[56:43] one of the biggest denominations in the
[56:45] world now we got a headquarters to bring
[56:52] by style the Queen before the King now
[56:54] what to do he didn't want at that time
[56:58] he still wanted to use that Queen he
[57:04] wanted her to be queen and he wanted
[57:06] everybody to see her but what happened
[57:13] show her beauty for she was fair to look
[57:16] on but the Queen bashed I refused
[57:24] refused to come at the Kings commandment
[57:29] look by his minister he preached the
[57:37] word through them seven but actually him
[57:43] saying it but by his Chamberlain's they
[57:49] brought the message to Vashta and said
[57:52] the key wants to see you
[57:54] and bashed I says don't want to see him
[58:02] brother Brown said that's the same way
[58:04] the denominations have done that's the
[58:07] same way we can do we can refuse the
[58:11] prophet of God said a further 'men of
[58:12] the word they refused the further one of
[58:15] the word they didn't want to come to the
[58:17] King anymore so what happened now watch
[58:23] but Queen Vashti I refused to come at
[58:25] the Kings commandment by his Chamberlain
[58:27] Chamberlain's
[58:28] therefore was the King very wroth and
[58:31] his anger burned in him now he was angry
[58:34] look you don't refuse a king naturally
[58:38] that's death you refuse a king in the
[58:42] natural world back then and you'd they
[58:43] just killed you but watch what happens
[58:47] then the king said to the wise men which
[58:50] knew the times in other words they were
[58:53] updated on the revelation for so was the
[58:57] Kings manner toward all that new law and
[58:59] judgment and the next to him was watch
[59:02] these are the Kings messengers princes
[59:04] and there's seven of them and the next
[59:10] unto him was carshena shet are
[59:13] admah the Tarshish meh res Barcena
[59:18] and ma'am you can now ma'am you can is
[59:23] the last one and ma'am you can means
[59:27] faithful now watch these are seven
[59:34] princes of Persia and media which saw
[59:37] the Kings face in other words they they
[59:41] were that close to the king
[59:43] but now watch what happens because he
[59:47] says what shall we do into the Queen
[59:50] Vashti according to the law because she
[59:53] has not performed the commandment of the
[59:55] king of sorts by the chin in other words
[59:57] we can't just let this go on we can't
[1:00:02] just let this happen there's got to be
[1:00:05] some kind of repercussion because you
[1:00:08] can't turn God down and there be no
[1:00:10] repercussion everybody okay leg up maybe
[1:00:20] we want to have like a movie or
[1:00:21] something Entertainment folks that's all
[1:00:26] we're in we just want somebody to
[1:00:28] entertain us this is pretty entertaining
[1:00:32] to me how that always happened 4,000
[1:00:35] years ago and I can sit here and put
[1:00:36] myself and every bit of this if you want
[1:00:41] to be identified in the word then all
[1:00:43] you gotta do is look look that's your
[1:00:45] identification what shall we do into the
[1:00:50] Queen bash now according to law because
[1:00:52] remember you know God can't work outside
[1:00:53] his law he can't just make up a word his
[1:00:57] word is 66 books of the Bible he's got
[1:00:59] to condemn her by the word amen
[1:01:04] the denominations had to be condemned by
[1:01:07] the Word of God not by God just saying I
[1:01:11] don't like him anymore no they had to do
[1:01:13] something to cause his law to come into
[1:01:16] effect and there's what the repercussion
[1:01:19] comes from thereby okay with that with
[1:01:21] just a few more minutes and then won't
[1:01:22] stop so she refused and he's like we got
[1:01:26] to do something what are you seven men
[1:01:28] decide and think we ought to do look at
[1:01:32] verse 16 also his name means dignified
[1:01:39] now who spoke the seventh guy
[1:01:45] the seventh man comes up with an idea
[1:01:51] the seventh man gets a revelation
[1:01:55] because remember they speak for the King
[1:01:58] in all of the matters so this seventh
[1:02:02] man
[1:02:03] the Lord answered before the king and
[1:02:08] the princes vast time the Queen hath not
[1:02:11] done wrong to the King only in other
[1:02:16] words she's condemned the whole world
[1:02:20] not just a feint to clean the king
[1:02:23] because watch what happens but also to
[1:02:27] all the princes into all the people that
[1:02:32] are in the provinces of King a source in
[1:02:34] other words all true Christendom this
[1:02:40] denominational ideas popped up that we
[1:02:43] don't have to do what God tells us to do
[1:02:45] we don't have to do what the game tells
[1:02:47] us to do something's got to come about
[1:02:50] because then everybody else is going to
[1:02:52] just do what they want to do they meant
[1:02:54] no headship we must have headship that's
[1:02:59] why that seventh man watch what he's
[1:03:00] fixing to say he's fixing to lay it out
[1:03:03] just like brother Branham laid it out
[1:03:06] watch the message of the hour in verse
[1:03:08] 17 through 22 that's why number seven
[1:03:12] spoke for this deed of the Queen now
[1:03:17] what is a queen shall come abroad unto
[1:03:20] all churches women or churches right in
[1:03:25] other words this father son Holy Ghost
[1:03:28] baptism is going to come out and I see
[1:03:30] and it's going to go into every woman so
[1:03:35] that they shall despise their headship
[1:03:38] in their eyes that don't make it right
[1:03:42] but in their eyes they're going to
[1:03:44] despise their headship when it shall be
[1:03:48] reported in other words when the report
[1:03:50] goes out the church is the women are
[1:03:54] going to say well if you don't have to
[1:03:56] cut your thumb if you I can cut your
[1:03:58] iron
[1:03:58] you don't have to do what God said I
[1:04:00] don't have to do what he says he's the
[1:04:06] king of source commanded by styler queen
[1:04:08] to be brought in before him but she came
[1:04:10] not in other words she refused and set
[1:04:12] up a denomination likewise what shall
[1:04:16] the ladies churches of Persia Medea say
[1:04:19] this day into all the Kings princes
[1:04:21] which have heard of the deed of the
[1:04:23] Queen thus shall there arise too much
[1:04:26] contempt and wrath nobody got that but I
[1:04:34] watch this is memucan this is the
[1:04:37] dignified God this is another number 7
[1:04:40] guy that has more revelation obviously
[1:04:43] than the rest of them cuz rest of them
[1:04:44] are probably just sitting there shaking
[1:04:45] their head but this guy's standing up
[1:04:47] and said look this is what would you do
[1:04:49] if it please the King let there go a
[1:04:53] royal commandment from him
[1:04:57] Bible and let it be written
[1:05:01] among the laws of the Persians and Medes
[1:05:04] that it be not altered can't change the
[1:05:07] Word of God that vast I come no more
[1:05:11] before the king in other words he's
[1:05:13] cutting her off and let the king give
[1:05:17] her royal estate unto another that is
[1:05:21] better than she brother branham comes in
[1:05:23] and he comes into the denominational
[1:05:25] world what happens they don't want him
[1:05:27] oh yeah they do for a little while for
[1:05:29] all the the healings and all that stuff
[1:05:32] but then they start going no we don't we
[1:05:35] don't want that anymore so God says okay
[1:05:39] brother Adam here's your real message
[1:05:42] it's to a group of people that will
[1:05:44] accept you there's an Esther getting
[1:05:47] ready to come on the scene that she's
[1:05:49] going to do exactly what you tell her to
[1:05:51] do I'm gonna send her a little prophet a
[1:05:54] little uncle a little guy a razor and
[1:05:58] then we're gonna present Esther to the
[1:06:03] king
[1:06:05] listen brother branham he's not God but
[1:06:09] he did help us get dressed hey man he
[1:06:13] helped not just physically he helps us
[1:06:15] get dressed so that we can be in the
[1:06:18] King's Chamber not just be somebody out
[1:06:22] in another palace will read that when we
[1:06:23] get on into the get on into here but
[1:06:27] look that vast I come no more before in
[1:06:29] other words cut her off take all over
[1:06:32] everything away from her that I gave her
[1:06:34] and that's what God did he threw her in
[1:06:37] the bed of adultery remember the
[1:06:40] scripture and let the King give her
[1:06:43] royal estate unto another that is better
[1:06:45] than she now this is mammy Ken this is
[1:06:49] the number seven guy and when the Kings
[1:06:51] decree which he shall make shall be
[1:06:53] published eleven hundred sermons
[1:07:00] published and send it to the whole world
[1:07:06] for it is great I like that little
[1:07:09] parenthesis for it is great all the
[1:07:14] wives shall give to their husbands honor
[1:07:16] both the great and small what you doing
[1:07:18] when the prophet of God preached he
[1:07:19] preached headship headship headship
[1:07:22] headship it has to start with God but
[1:07:25] then it has to go to the home look and
[1:07:31] the saying please the king and the
[1:07:34] princess and the King did according to
[1:07:37] the words of mammy Ken for he sent
[1:07:42] letters 1100 em all over the world into
[1:07:53] every province according to the writing
[1:07:56] thereof and to every people after their
[1:07:59] language and these 1100 sermons not been
[1:08:04] put in every language almost in the
[1:08:08] world and it was the words of memucan
[1:08:12] that spoken but it was the King back in
[1:08:15] the month that's the same way what
[1:08:17] happened
[1:08:18] to spread the message and every people
[1:08:21] after their language that every man
[1:08:23] looks Chabert rule in his own house and
[1:08:28] that it should be published according to
[1:08:31] the language of every people the
[1:08:34] headship of God was restored under
[1:08:37] William branham's ministry no doubt
[1:08:40] there's no doubt of that because you
[1:08:43] lose your headship when you turn against
[1:08:44] God when you decide you're gonna do
[1:08:46] something contrary to the Word of God
[1:08:47] you lose your headship you come out from
[1:08:49] under that's why brother Ram talks about
[1:08:50] when you cut your hair women when you
[1:08:52] cut your hair you've come out from
[1:08:54] another headship of your of your husband
[1:08:55] se mueve you cut yourself off with God
[1:08:57] as bashed I did she decided just like
[1:09:02] Ruth decided but she made the wrong
[1:09:03] decision so here we are backs I decided
[1:09:07] to just say I'm gonna have my own feast
[1:09:10] I'm gonna have my own church and you
[1:09:13] look in revelations 3 14 15 16 17 down
[1:09:16] to that where's Christ outside the
[1:09:20] church trying to get back in
[1:09:23] cuz bashed I had shut him out and kicked
[1:09:25] him out of his own house and locked the
[1:09:27] door but you know what he said if any
[1:09:30] man will hear my voice hear my voice and
[1:09:34] open the door I will come in and sup
[1:09:39] with him we're fixing to see this this
[1:09:43] hears musicians come let's stand to our
[1:09:47] feet here's this King now in a quandary
[1:09:51] we're gonna look at next Sunday he's in
[1:09:53] a quandary he has no wife anymore
[1:09:55] Kings gotta have a wife Kings got to
[1:09:59] have a queen he now he's cut this one
[1:10:01] off and you know what under the laws of
[1:10:03] the Medes and Persians once the law is
[1:10:05] written we're going to see in a few
[1:10:08] minutes of our next week once the law is
[1:10:10] written it cannot it cannot be altered
[1:10:15] it cannot be changed or it cannot be
[1:10:18] stricken out same way with the Word of
[1:10:21] God once it's written it can't be
[1:10:24] changed it can't be your own idea best I
[1:10:28] cannot be your idea
[1:10:31] but now we see a king but now watch
[1:10:36] here's this great king and he's very
[1:10:38] very intelligent he's got these princes
[1:10:42] over here he's got one guy that give him
[1:10:44] this idea that to make 1100 sermons and
[1:10:48] send this little guy named Mordecai and
[1:10:51] you've got the Chamberlain's over here
[1:10:53] you've got carcass and all the different
[1:10:55] ones that are sitting and hit there you
[1:10:57] say what are you saying by the way the
[1:10:59] fivefold ministry does not tell god what
[1:11:01] to do but they're right there with him
[1:11:05] and through his through what through
[1:11:08] what the king what what ma'am you can
[1:11:10] done ma'am you can call it the
[1:11:11] revelation that was inside that Kings
[1:11:13] head because the King needed a queen the
[1:11:16] king had to have a queen he couldn't
[1:11:18] have this one and he couldn't let the
[1:11:21] situation go on like it was but he
[1:11:24] couldn't change the law he couldn't just
[1:11:27] say no he just took it just took all of
[1:11:31] her power away from her and put her out
[1:11:34] there somewhere and said okay you can
[1:11:36] have your church you can have you
[1:11:38] denomination I'm just not gonna be out
[1:11:40] there I'm going to find me a bride that
[1:11:44] will dress right there like right and
[1:11:48] every time I call she'll answer didn't
[1:11:51] know what to Brian you know what you
[1:11:52] want
[1:11:53] amen god bless you that's the first
[1:11:55] stage of the Esther then I hope you
[1:11:56] enjoyed it but it's it's just something
[1:11:58] that thrills my heart to know that these
[1:12:00] people go through these things and
[1:12:02] everything everything this has been
[1:12:04] written this Bible's been written for
[1:12:05] 1,500 years or longer compiled in just
[1:12:09] about 500 years but he's still been
[1:12:11] written the book of Esther was written a
[1:12:12] long time ago but compiled several you
[1:12:15] know five hundred years ago but it's
[1:12:16] still been there to read and people have
[1:12:19] been joined it and it was a wonderful
[1:12:21] story but you and I have had a mordecai
[1:12:24] to come and bring us the love letter
[1:12:27] bring us to underline the allegory the
[1:12:30] whatever you want to call it but here's
[1:12:33] you got your surface and you've got your
[1:12:35] actors playing out but you see
[1:12:36] underneath that that's me and you look
[1:12:40] at the threes in the sevens and why does
[1:12:42] the seventh guy speak and wives
[1:12:44] Guylaine carcass and why you got a king
[1:12:46] and why you got one that you know
[1:12:49] refused herself to the king just like
[1:12:51] the in the end time that's just the way
[1:12:53] it is we're looking at the listen those
[1:12:58] people are dead and gone
[1:13:00] their bodies are somewhere in this earth
[1:13:03] but it's their dust their soul lives on
[1:13:06] somewhere but you and I are alive and
[1:13:10] when we read that we see ourselves as
[1:13:14] Esther we did see ourselves as best at
[1:13:17] one time when I was out in the world I
[1:13:20] refused a lot of things of God I don't
[1:13:23] know if you did or not but I did but
[1:13:25] then what did God do because it I gotta
[1:13:27] find a bride I gotta find a bride and I
[1:13:31] gotta send the preachers I gotta send
[1:13:33] seven Church ages I gotta send seven
[1:13:36] messengers in those seven churches and
[1:13:38] then they're gonna do exactly what my my
[1:13:42] thoughts are gonna be projected through
[1:13:44] those people and they're gonna find me a
[1:13:46] bride and guess what there's a little
[1:13:49] man named Mordecai walks in right there
[1:13:51] to seventh he walks right in and you'll
[1:13:54] see in a minute it'll be in the seventh
[1:13:56] year of the Kings reign you know this
[1:13:59] happens in the third year but he's gonna
[1:14:02] walk in on about the seventh year of the
[1:14:03] Kings reign so well kind of gets a
[1:14:05] little bit God gets a little bit good

[1:18:44] little man about that tall was gonna
[1:18:47] preach and she said I just thought I'd
