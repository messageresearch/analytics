[21:14] Psalms 1 38 8 now we're still talking
[21:18] about revival and I had a little treat
[21:20] this morning I mean I'm doing triple
[21:21] duty today I had
[21:22] early this morning and speaking of men's
[21:24] breakfast for the United Methodist
[21:26] Church so I survived I lived through the
[21:31] whole thing so did they gym dads two
[21:37] brothers were there so the Methodist
[21:41] preacher that he talks about the whole
[21:42] time he was there and he he said he
[21:46] didn't know he didn't know I had it in
[21:47] me I said well it ain't me though I walk
[21:50] in the midst of trouble
[21:51] now what revived me and I did speak
[21:54] about revival to them because I want
[21:56] them to ever the whole world to see that
[21:58] that there needs to be an individual
[22:00] revival not a worldwide revival but an
[22:02] individual revival some thou shalt
[22:04] stretch forth thine hand against the
[22:06] wrath of my enemies and thy right hand
[22:07] shall save me the Lord will perfect that
[22:10] which concerning me I like that the Lord
[22:13] will perfect that which concern if me
[22:16] now mercy O Lord and do it forever
[22:19] forsake not the works of thine own hand
[22:21] let's read Psalms 85 1 turn us o god of
[22:24] our salvation and caused on anger toward
[22:26] us to cease wilt thou be angry with us
[22:29] forever
[22:30] wilt thou draw out that anger to all
[22:32] generations remember this is David
[22:34] speaking wilt thou not revive us again
[22:38] that died people may rejoice in thee you
[22:43] may be seated in the Lord at his
[22:44] blessing to the reading of the word
[22:46] you'll have to excuse me just a minute
[22:48] I've got a slow leak but take what take
[22:55] vitamin C I believe think so hey but
[23:00] vitamins these kind of hard to chew on
[23:02] vitamin nobody got that that's right
[23:10] slowly is trickling back okay huh she
[23:15] said take zinc I said that's kind of
[23:17] hard to swallow
[23:20] zinc of the metal okay let's get to the
[23:24] quote number one goodness gracious
[23:28] but take vitamin C it's good for your
[23:31] body it keeps you from having colds
[23:33] let's look at number one recognizing
[23:35] your day in this
[23:36] message brother Anthony we don't act
[23:38] this way all the time a lot of times on
[23:41] Sundays though we do recognize you
[23:43] entertaining this message the property
[23:46] god this is the prayer that I have on my
[23:47] refrigerator and I hope you put on yours
[23:49] God created me a revival let me be the
[23:54] revival let each one of us be the
[23:57] revival the revival in me make me Lord
[24:01] to hunger make me the thirst create in
[24:04] me Lord that what is needed in me let me
[24:09] from this hour on be thine more
[24:11] consecrated servant a better servant
[24:14] more blessed of you more able more
[24:16] humbler more kinder more willing to work
[24:18] more looking to the things that are
[24:21] positive and forgetting the things that
[24:23] are in the past and the negatives let me
[24:26] press toward the mark of the high
[24:28] calling of Christ amen amen that should
[24:32] be everybody's prayer that God created
[24:35] me a revival I was telling him this
[24:37] morning I've told you before but we we
[24:40] have spent all of our life waiting on
[24:42] somebody else to start a revival well if
[24:46] so and so we'll just if this person will
[24:49] just brother brother never said that he
[24:54] said created me revival let me be the
[24:58] revival the Welsh revival was the
[25:01] policeman on the corner when the man
[25:02] came up dead where's the wealth revival
[25:04] he said you're looking at it so let's
[25:08] stop looking and for this some great
[25:10] preacher too to come or some great
[25:13] person to raise up because we're gonna
[25:15] we see all the characteristics for the
[25:17] ones of you that haven't been here we're
[25:18] going to kind of go over it a little bit
[25:19] again look at number two the
[25:21] resurrection of Lazarus brother I'm said
[25:23] brother I feel real good right now
[25:25] what this church needs today is a good
[25:27] revival now as I was telling them this
[25:30] morning in the 1960s going to the
[25:35] Baptist Church there would be a banner
[25:37] up and it would usually be in June or
[25:39] July because that's when most people
[25:40] would come to church they wouldn't come
[25:43] when it's cold so they'd have a revival
[25:46] beginning on Sunday
[25:48] and the song leader would get up into
[25:51] Baptist Church you know how they do this
[25:52] you know they the song leader from the
[25:54] Baptist Church they do this he would
[25:56] sing revive us again Phil I see it just
[26:01] liked it Danny Brown filled his heart
[26:03] with I love mate so be rekindled with
[26:07] far from ball hallelujah on the go and
[26:11] you know you were
[26:13] that's enough free time doing this but
[26:17] that's the way it would be in it but
[26:18] know what it would be though that would
[26:20] fill the altars and then like someone
[26:21] said said they they'd preach you a fiery
[26:23] sermon and then they would then they
[26:25] dangle your soul over Hell like a weenie
[26:28] over a fire you know we don't want you
[26:30] to go to eternal hell so come to the
[26:32] altar that's not what a revival is
[26:34] nothing in the nothing in scripture are
[26:37] in definition says that a revival it's
[26:42] saving of souls that is not what it is a
[26:46] revival is just stirring up of what you
[26:51] already know about
[26:53] it's what's stirring up what you already
[26:56] have
[26:57] now though you cast the net it will grab
[27:01] some people Zachary black it will grab
[27:07] some people and bring them in but what
[27:10] did he do it brought brother Zach to a
[27:12] realization he didn't have what he
[27:13] thought he had that okay so then it
[27:18] brought him to a realization now he can
[27:21] start his own little revival and revive
[27:24] what has become inside of him
[27:26] so we're not saying that it was to not
[27:28] bring centers in they don't but it will
[27:30] if you become so intoxicated with God
[27:33] it's God like brother Daryl said it's
[27:35] got to pull people in but mainly a
[27:38] revival is it's a stirring up of what
[27:42] you already have as I told him this
[27:45] morning real simple the children of
[27:47] Israel under Joseph they were fine they
[27:51] weren't slaves
[27:53] Joseph said come into Egypt so they come
[27:55] into Egypt and after a length of time
[27:58] though what happens is it's kind of like
[28:00] the old adage brother Anthony if you
[28:02] want to if you want to boil a frog the
[28:04] frogs got to be alive before you can
[28:06] boil it because it releases poison kind
[28:08] of like a lobster so you take you excuse
[28:13] me you take the Frog and you don't boil
[28:15] the water and throw the frog in he'll
[28:17] jump straight out because it's hot we
[28:20] put him in there about 90 degrees when
[28:23] he's like in the pond and he's kind of
[28:25] kind of warm then you just keep turning
[28:27] the heat up and it'll absolutely cook
[28:30] that cook that poor frog and he'll never
[28:33] know he's dying that's what Satan has
[28:36] done to us he's put us in a lukewarm
[28:39] condition and he has started the heat
[28:42] and that's what he did with the children
[28:44] of Israel listen the children of Israel
[28:46] were the children of God so they didn't
[28:49] have to become the children of God they
[28:51] were already the children of God they
[28:53] just got caught in bondage and needed a
[28:55] revival listen it wasn't Moses that
[28:59] brought the revival the Bible tells you
[29:04] the people began to cry out when they
[29:08] realized they weren't just visitors in
[29:10] Egypt anymore that they were slaves and
[29:14] that's the way we are we must realize
[29:17] that we are the children of God but we
[29:19] can get caught in a place that we're
[29:23] caught in slavery and don't even know it
[29:26] sometimes but Satan keeps turning that
[29:29] heat up but being a child of God God
[29:32] will never let you die be a child of the
[29:35] devil he'll just let you go ahead and
[29:36] cook but a child of God he'll make you
[29:39] realize and what will happen is there
[29:41] will be a revival not a resurrection big
[29:47] difference resurrection is somebody died
[29:50] and had to be brought back to life
[29:53] that's it you're new birth but a revival
[29:56] is reviving the person that you already
[29:58] got inside of you and where God can use
[30:02] you to do the works of God not the works
[30:05] of the devil
[30:06] everybody got that same man so it's just
[30:09] a stirring up of what you already know
[30:12] about so the children of Israel
[30:15] got into the place they were tired they
[30:16] were sick and tired of being sick and
[30:18] tired
[30:19] amen so what happened then the call that
[30:23] the people gave to God sit second Ana
[30:29] hey buddy back there good to have little
[30:33] Hudson with us today glad you brought
[30:37] your parents to church but the call came
[30:41] out from the people it's gotta come from
[30:44] the people I'll read you a quote where
[30:47] brother Brown said preacher can't bring
[30:48] a revival I sit here and I can scream as
[30:54] loud as I want to and it won't do any
[30:55] good unless you catch what's being said
[30:58] and then you take it with you and do
[31:01] something about it
[31:02] alright so it's gonna be done the way
[31:05] that God wants it done it's the people
[31:08] cry out for a revival and then God sent
[31:11] them a Moses amen same way with the
[31:16] whole world the whole world was dying in
[31:18] sin and iniquity and God took his
[31:21] incentive south and then on the day of
[31:25] Pentecost there become a revival there
[31:27] was something that came up then I told
[31:34] you many times before one of the
[31:36] greatest revivals in the 1800s was in
[31:40] Dwight Moody's time in two different
[31:41] ones but then around the turn of the
[31:44] century right before brother Branham
[31:45] comes on the scene to spearhead the
[31:47] healing revival what happened was and
[31:50] I'm reading back in history and you can
[31:52] read it yourself it's real plain in the
[31:54] 1900s there was no cure for a lot of
[31:56] things what was happening was there was
[31:58] the illness was without performing any
[32:02] kind of medicine and the people of God
[32:09] started crying out God we need healing
[32:13] man has come to a place to where they
[32:16] can't take these disease now but now
[32:18] look you today we have an advancement of
[32:20] medicine listen folks you really don't
[32:24] need faith today
[32:26] you go to the doctor because there's one
[32:29] on every corner there's a specialist for
[32:31] your hair and the pimples on your finger
[32:35] and all these others there's a
[32:36] specialist for your fingernails you
[32:38] understand what I mean that wasn't in
[32:40] the nineteen or the twentieth right at
[32:41] the turn of the century there was just
[32:44] little home remedies well the people the
[32:46] Christians started crying out to God and
[32:49] said God we need a revival so God sent
[32:54] them a healing revival worth thousands
[32:58] and hundreds of thousands but not only
[33:00] did he send the revival
[33:01] he said William Marion Branham a prophet
[33:05] that could literally look inside of you
[33:07] and tell you where it was that what
[33:10] would happen when you got healed that
[33:14] they didn't know nothing about oh that
[33:18] thing's gonna swell like a little puppy
[33:19] dog that gets hit on the side of the
[33:21] road how simple is that
[33:22] you're gonna get sicker before you get
[33:23] better now who would have told him that
[33:26] the doctors not gonna tell him that
[33:27] Dobbs are gonna say let's cut the thing
[33:30] out no but the great physician was on
[33:33] the scene through a prophet in the end
[33:34] time and he was as I've always said that
[33:37] Albert Einstein one of the greatest
[33:39] minds in the world was on the earth but
[33:41] there was a there was a spiritual
[33:43] Einstein called William Branham that he
[33:46] knew he went out as an eagle and went up
[33:48] higher and he could be able to see
[33:49] things that man could never see when I
[33:52] see the advancement now and the sickness
[33:54] has come almost close together because
[33:56] remember brother Branham said cancer
[33:57] would be as a toothache in the end time
[34:01] so now listen member brother Brent
[34:04] preached a lot of sermons don't do you
[34:05] fear cancer well they feared that word a
[34:07] long time ago now it's not so much why
[34:10] because the advancement of manners went
[34:12] so far so what are we saying we're
[34:14] saying we don't need
[34:17] a healing revival Oh Lord we love to get
[34:21] healed I mean we love to get healed but
[34:24] there's no healing campaign going on
[34:26] that's not promised anymore this revival
[34:29] we're talking about now is a word
[34:32] revival it's going back to the Word of
[34:35] God which has healing in it which that
[34:37] salvation in it but you got to be able
[34:40] to stir up what you've already got and
[34:44] then bring some of you to a realization
[34:46] that you don't have but you want it and
[34:53] you groan and cry waiting for it and God
[34:58] sends it doesn't he promised he would
[35:01] buddy all right let's go testimony on
[35:07] the sea so we're not looking for we're
[35:09] not looking for a listen we're not even
[35:10] looking for a one-man message anymore
[35:12] this is this is the bride this is the
[35:14] bride aged brother Branham was one to
[35:16] bring us the message but as I was
[35:19] telling them downstairs in the Sunday
[35:21] School class church age messengers only
[35:24] were in a certain small part of their
[35:26] church age Columba wasn't even in his
[35:32] church age he died before the church age
[35:35] that he was accredited with began
[35:37] according to the Prophet so who took the
[35:40] message the people it's in the people
[35:44] sure sure we cried out for many things
[35:46] and God would send somebody we cried
[35:49] listening to people in the Catholic
[35:50] Church cried out to God God why do we
[35:53] have to do penance why do we have to
[35:55] pray to dead Saints why do we have to do
[35:58] this why do we have to do that sister
[35:59] antlers been a Catholic was the Catholic
[36:01] she knows what he's talking about they
[36:03] build all their life on that stuff you
[36:06] know walking through the cobblestone on
[36:07] your knees and all that stuff no the
[36:09] people cried out and said god this can't
[36:11] be it
[36:13] and God said okay I got a little guy
[36:16] named Martin Luther he's in your system
[36:18] but I'm fixing to bring him out and he's
[36:21] going to preach you a message that's
[36:22] gonna bring you out of that
[36:25] now what more are we looking at today
[36:27] we're lucky we've had the message to
[36:30] bring us out and take us out what are we
[36:32] doing here we need to revive what's
[36:35] already here not a new message not a new
[36:38] doctrine not a new mystery I thought you
[36:42] and I were the mystery number three
[36:46] testimony on the seat and then we began
[36:49] to find out miracles isn't taking place
[36:51] in a more like like they were let's it
[36:54] go home sick it is of God is it because
[36:58] of God
[36:58] you can't blame God for none of that
[37:01] it's because of the lack of the revival
[37:04] among the preachers huh
[37:09] it's the preachers fault always people
[37:18] lack of the revival among the people
[37:22] there is no revival they sit and listen
[37:25] go home and say well I guess that was
[37:27] pretty good on huh see there's not that
[37:30] zeal there's not that something in the
[37:33] people that should be there he didn't
[37:36] call them non-christians but there's
[37:39] something not in there I was telling
[37:44] them a story this morning I went to the
[37:48] dentist I think I felt something even if
[37:50] I went to the dentist this little girl
[37:52] was there you know and she was getting
[37:56] ready to work on my teeth and she was an
[37:57] assistant she was talking to the doctor
[38:01] Amy and she said we went to this church
[38:03] the other Sunday and we've been trying
[38:04] to find a church we went to this church
[38:06] the other Sunday and that guy preached
[38:08] 20 minutes we're finding us another
[38:12] church you know me mouth full of cotton
[38:20] mouth full of Novocain I didn't care I
[38:23] care
[38:27] why'd you tell mom I did I looked over I
[38:30] said do what she said 20 minutes he
[38:35] priest said Lord it was like an eternity
[38:37] I looked at her and I said let me tell
[38:40] you something lady my righteous
[38:42] indignation got up a little bit I think
[38:43] it was the drugs
[38:46] i'ma blame it on them anyway Levi but no
[38:49] I looked at and I said lady what are you
[38:53] going to church for I did because
[38:56] somebody went Oh Heather somebody went
[38:58] after I did and then the lady was still
[39:00] kind of healing me but I really didn't
[39:01] care cuz I told her I said look you want
[39:04] to go to church in here about 15 minutes
[39:06] about a man that hung on a cross for
[39:09] three hours nails in both hands nails
[39:13] and his feet a crown of thorns on his
[39:16] head for three hours and you can't set
[39:19] 20 minutes and let somebody tell you
[39:21] about him I told I said you set for an
[39:29] hour and watch Bachelorette or whatever
[39:31] they were talking about and you'll just
[39:33] I can't believe that girl is going out
[39:36] with four men for one hour they'll sit
[39:39] there and listen and watch but they
[39:44] won't sit 20 minutes I said sister if
[39:47] our people took 20 minutes of our
[39:49] sermons I said they would beat that
[39:50] string us up well some of you might not
[39:53] but I mean what would your comment bake
[39:58] if somebody just come up and preached
[39:59] you 20 minutes and then you went to the
[40:01] house but that's all they do
[40:03] that's the world they don't have God
[40:08] they have a form of godliness but
[40:11] denying the power of the word that's why
[40:13] I thought about a word revival it's got
[40:16] to become from the Word of God
[40:20] I was a little wheel whither cuz my
[40:24] heavens can you believe somebody would
[40:27] literally I'm not going back to that
[40:29] church ain't twenty minutes anyway
[40:36] moving right along
[40:37] Joel to verse 23 let's go to that one
[40:40] we've been with before we'll get to a
[40:43] certain spot and then I'm gonna wait til
[40:44] for Wednesday night and finish this up
[40:49] be glad and rejoice the children of Zion
[40:54] talking to you and rejoicing the Lord
[40:57] your God for he hath given you the
[40:59] former rain moderately and he will cause
[41:02] to come down for you the rain the former
[41:05] rain and the latter rain in the first
[41:06] month and the floor shall be full of
[41:09] wheat and the facts overflow with wine
[41:10] and oil and I will restore or I will
[41:14] revive unto you remember that bride tree
[41:19] never died
[41:21] but it got eat to the stump but there
[41:25] was still life thank God in the roots
[41:28] you can't kill God there that tree will
[41:32] still it look like you couldn't see
[41:34] nothing
[41:34] look out there now middle of the dead of
[41:37] the winter time you look down in your
[41:38] lawn well - green because it's fescue
[41:40] but you look down and you think there's
[41:43] nothing there
[41:44] don't worry give it a little it's got
[41:48] plenty of moisture so all it needs is
[41:50] some warmth and then you'll see things
[41:52] start popping up why the life is down in
[41:54] the ground the life is in the earth and
[41:59] I will restore or revive to you the
[42:02] years that what the badness need to
[42:05] penticoff see that's what brother brown
[42:08] said all the different denominations
[42:09] they ate that tree down because of their
[42:13] creeds and dogmas but it's promised I
[42:18] will restore that tree you can't kill
[42:24] the Tree of Life this why it's called
[42:27] the tree of
[42:28] life and I will restore to you the years
[42:32] and you say what's that got to do that
[42:33] read seen them before
[42:34] broken sister and brother man said I
[42:36] don't need no fill it don't need no
[42:38] filter no straining is talking about
[42:40] that bubbling water that comes up out of
[42:42] the ground no pumping no jerking no
[42:44] nothing else it's just there bubbling up
[42:46] it don't have it don't have to depend on
[42:49] local rains to fill it out now look
[42:52] rains or revivals so he's going to send
[42:56] the former revival and the latter
[42:58] revival in the same month which is right
[43:02] now we've had the former rain or former
[43:05] revival which is the teaching revival of
[43:07] the Word of God through the prophet in
[43:10] the end time and through the fivefold
[43:12] ministry and then God is getting ready
[43:14] to take them the second stage are the
[43:18] latter rain and he's gonna harvest
[43:21] what's been planning rains or revivals
[43:28] that's that fountain of life where the
[43:32] carcass is what's the carcass the word
[43:35] where the word is the Eagles will gather
[43:38] you don't have to pump up a revival you
[43:41] don't have to pump up nothing that's
[43:44] what I mean we could sit here we could
[43:46] have a real emotional service and it
[43:49] would just be an emotional service but
[43:52] what does it do for us I don't mind I
[43:54] like to I like to sing songs and get
[43:58] pumped up sure keeps you from sleeping
[44:01] so much sister Elmo blames sister Anna
[44:07] marooned of today for all this
[44:08] sleepiness she fed us cake and ice cream
[44:11] during between services so the carbs are
[44:14] hitting about 253 which is right now if
[44:21] I fall asleep we all in trouble all
[44:25] right wake yourself number 5 let's get
[44:29] through this getting in the spirit
[44:31] that's the way you get a revival it's
[44:34] when you really get in the spirit of
[44:36] revival not whooping it up or something
[44:39] but praying it down praying it down
[44:44] until there's a revival strikes your
[44:47] heart until all the logs of a cliche
[44:49] please the axis ISM and all the logs of
[44:53] fanaticism we're going to come back to
[44:55] this Wednesday night because we're gonna
[44:57] talk about the River of Life and we're
[44:59] gonna talk about them logs clogging up
[45:02] the river and all the logs of fanaticism
[45:08] and all the logs of systems and all the
[45:11] logs of unbelief flows out and then the
[45:14] waters of God come falling down upon you
[45:18] there you are
[45:20] third seal now that's what's reasons
[45:25] today the revivals were supposed to have
[45:27] now remember in 1963 he just came out of
[45:32] that healing revival that I was talking
[45:34] about everybody got that same m4 though
[45:37] she Lear sleeps a man
[45:40] okay-dokey so what's he talking about
[45:44] you think man this guy is gonna talk
[45:46] about this great revival that he just
[45:48] came out of we have denominational
[45:53] revivals which listen a denominational
[45:56] revival cannot be a word revival they
[45:59] have no word to revive we haven't had a
[46:03] real stirring no no no no no sir don't
[46:07] think we got revivals we haven't oh they
[46:09] got millions and millions and millions
[46:11] of church members but not a revival no
[46:13] we're no no the the bride hasn't had a
[46:16] revival yet there's been no revival
[46:21] there no manifestation of God to stir
[46:24] the bride yet see we're looking for it
[46:26] it'll take those seven unknown thunders
[46:29] back there to wake her up again a way
[46:32] down that sleep bath
[46:35] in this church look I'm glad God sent us
[46:41] a prophet he will that's as much as God
[46:45] telling me that he's gonna send it he
[46:49] will send it he promised it so he's
[46:52] gonna send us a word revival whether you
[46:55] part of it or not is up to you now let's
[46:59] go to number seven broken system 1965
[47:04] but that's the way God does he
[47:05] humiliates us in our educational system
[47:08] not as I'm trying to support ignorance
[47:10] don't put your kids out of school but
[47:15] I'm trying to tell you the difference
[47:17] education can never bring life it takes
[47:19] the Spirit of God to bring life and that
[47:22] life must not come out of just the
[47:24] intellectual revival it's got to come
[47:28] out of the Bible word revival and that
[47:32] word is the same yesterday today and
[47:34] forever and when it falls today and
[47:36] quickens you get the same result as you
[47:39] did in Acts - exactly it always has it
[47:42] always will look because it's the Spirit
[47:44] of God that conditions the atmosphere
[47:49] that's what we were talking about last
[47:51] couple of Sunday's ago about Dunamis
[47:53] power and exosphere power that it's got
[47:56] to create an atmosphere there's got to
[47:58] be an atmosphere created so that God can
[48:00] come listen he's not gonna come into
[48:02] some of our atmosphere hello some of
[48:07] them I create I really don't want him
[48:09] there because he'd be it's really a
[48:12] shame to me Susan
[48:15] Stephen said me hey but God wants to
[48:19] help us though if we'll if we'll let the
[48:23] spirit help us condition the atmosphere
[48:25] it'll always be where God can walk in
[48:27] and say hey I'm here I'm here to help
[48:29] you hey man that's what a revival is for
[48:32] us to revive you to tell you hey you can
[48:34] do this if you'll do these things get in
[48:38] the spirit not some kind of other spirit
[48:42] but the Spirit of God and it will
[48:44] condition the atmosphere so that God can
[48:47] come in and what quicken the word number
[48:52] eight perk of me in church a hey by
[48:54] alright perk of me in church age but God
[48:57] never placed signs the head of the word
[48:59] signs follow the word that's when Elijah
[49:03] told the woman to make a cake for him
[49:05] first according to the word of the Lord
[49:08] when she did as the word said the proper
[49:11] sign came come to the word first and
[49:14] then watch the miracle the seed word is
[49:19] energized by the Spirit the Holy Spirit
[49:25] not some of the spirits we hang on to
[49:28] hello hey man Holy Spirit that's why
[49:34] they call it a Holy Spirit there's
[49:35] really some unholy ones but we don't
[49:37] want to deal with them John 14 mm-hmm if
[49:40] you love me keep my Commandments and I
[49:43] will pray the father and he shall give
[49:45] you another comforter that he may abide
[49:47] with you forever what is it
[49:49] the Spirit of Truth even the Spirit of
[49:53] Truth listen folks this word revival has
[49:57] got to be the real true Word of God
[50:02] God's has winked at so most of our
[50:06] ignorance until you come to a place to
[50:10] where now you can't plead ignorance no
[50:11] more because the Word of God is what to
[50:15] edge cutting
[50:18] dividing the spirit in the soul telling
[50:22] us where our problem really lies listen
[50:25] if you're born again today your problems
[50:26] not in your soul
[50:27] that's Almighty God the problems in your
[50:32] spirit the problems not in your flesh
[50:35] your flesh just does what your spirit
[50:36] tells it today and then even the Spirit
[50:39] of Truth whom the world cannot receive
[50:41] because it seeth him not are in other
[50:45] words not see but understand neither
[50:48] knoweth him but you know him for he
[50:52] dwelleth with you and shall be in you
[50:55] john 14 25 these things have i spoke
[50:59] good unto you being yet present with you
[51:01] but the comforter which is the Holy
[51:03] Ghost whom the father will send in my
[51:05] name he shall teach you all things and
[51:09] bring all things to your remembrance
[51:12] whatsoever I have said unto you John
[51:16] 16:12 I have yet many things to say unto
[51:20] you but you cannot bear them now why
[51:24] couldn't they bear them didn't have the
[51:26] Holy Ghost they'd understand what he was
[51:28] saying
[51:29] howbeit when he the Spirit of Truth has
[51:34] come he will guide you into all truth
[51:38] not part truth all truth for he shall
[51:43] not speak of himself but whatsoever he
[51:45] shall hear that shall he speak and he
[51:48] shall show you things to come a
[51:51] revelation he will show you things to
[51:55] come Luke 24 verse 49 said then behold I
[51:58] send the promise of my father upon you
[52:00] but tarry in the city of Jerusalem until
[52:03] you be endued with power from on high
[52:08] power that's 1 verse 7 and he said unto
[52:12] them it is not for you to know the times
[52:15] or the seasons which the father has put
[52:17] in his own power but ye shall receive
[52:19] power that word we're going to read in
[52:22] just a second is Dunamis it's dynamite
[52:26] power it's power that is inside of you
[52:29] it's creative power but you shall
[52:34] receive Dunamis power after that the
[52:37] Holy Ghost after so you can have
[52:40] excellency a power which is the
[52:42] permitted power and work under anointed
[52:45] ones and all these different things but
[52:46] you can't have Dunamis power in your
[52:48] soul and be lost that's God that's the
[52:51] power of God will read it in just a
[52:53] second and you shall be witnesses unto
[52:55] me Jerusalem Judea Samaria and the
[52:57] uttermost parts of Lulla Jordan make it
[53:01] personal
[53:02] amen alright let's go to the definition
[53:06] of that power is Dunamis and we went
[53:10] through this we'll fly through it pretty
[53:11] quick doing them
[53:12] means power virtue and I watch them
[53:15] what's the what's the second faith
[53:18] virtue strength power now not this kind
[53:24] of power listen the whole world thinks
[53:29] Sampson look like Arnold Schwarzenegger
[53:31] no he was a little shrimpy kid that's
[53:36] why it wouldn't be so it wouldn't be a
[53:38] revelation or a mystery if this guy
[53:40] walks in and goes I can pick that pillar
[53:42] up and I'll just take them walls down
[53:44] what if some little guy looks like Don
[53:49] Knotts most of you know who that is
[53:50] Barney Fife if he walked up and says I'm
[53:53] gonna pick them I'm gonna pick them to
[53:55] turn walls and and I'm gonna kill him on
[53:57] the hill they're gonna go really and he
[54:00] just goes that's why they were looking
[54:04] for his power inherent it means you
[54:11] inherited this power you inherited this
[54:18] power power residing anything by virtue
[54:26] of its nature if you're born again today
[54:27] you have the nature of God and it's not
[54:31] on you it's inside of you a wit of wit
[54:35] are which a person or thing exerts and
[54:37] puts forth moral power and excellence of
[54:41] soul the greatest power that ever come
[54:44] about was when Jesus walked out and said
[54:47] all power in heaven earth been given
[54:49] unto me he'd been dead for three days
[54:54] sometimes we look at powering and it's
[54:57] okay to exercise a little bit
[54:58] I kind of want to but don't worry buddy
[55:02] when you get 60 it goes
[55:05] it all fall because of gravity you know
[55:10] though the Bible does tell you to
[55:11] exercise your faith exercise your faith
[55:18] all right let's go to Romans 13 verse 1
[55:22] well they never soul be subject unto the
[55:25] higher powers for there is no power but
[55:27] of God remember Satan has no power
[55:31] Satan's powerless unless God gives him
[55:34] power and who gives him most of them his
[55:37] power take your hand watch take ahead
[55:39] and do this point at your neighbor and
[55:41] then go this guy right here is when he
[55:46] gives the devil the power that's what I
[55:48] said that everybody goes now for that
[55:50] black could have the power we'd be good
[55:52] well I think he's got it now so let's
[55:55] point somewhere else for there is no
[56:00] power but of God how can you deny
[56:03] there's only one creator and if that
[56:06] creator can say let there be and stand
[56:08] and watch this whole universe every star
[56:11] you look at tonight one man made it by
[56:15] his spoken word not out there with a
[56:17] shovel
[56:19] he just said let there be what do mighty
[56:24] God we serve
[56:25] I was looking at the Grand Canyon one
[56:28] day and I thought man there's no way man
[56:31] could fill this big hole up that thinks
[56:34] 300 miles long and a mile deep I said
[56:37] but God could speak one word and it shut
[56:40] right up or he'd bring enough dirt to
[56:42] fill it in in an instant that's the God
[56:44] we serve the powers that be are ordained
[56:49] of God whosoever therefore resisteth the
[56:53] power resisteth the ordinance of God and
[56:57] we're going to get into this in just a
[56:58] second that's what's happening in the
[57:00] world is the people are resisting the
[57:03] power of God and you and I to a degree
[57:06] do the same thing and they that resist
[57:13] shall receive to themselves damnation
[57:18] Romans 1 verse 16 enough I'm not ashamed
[57:21] of the gospel of Christ
[57:23] so what is the power of God the gospel
[57:27] of Jesus Christ for I am not ashamed of
[57:31] the gospel of Christ for it is the
[57:32] Dunamis or the power of God unto
[57:35] salvation to everyone that believeth to
[57:38] the Jew first and also to the Greek Luke
[57:42] 4 verse 32 and they were astonished at
[57:46] Jesus's doctrine for his word was with
[57:50] power his word was with Dunamis his word
[57:55] when he said something it happened Amen
[57:59] my brother Dale was talking about Adam
[58:02] when Adam was in the Garden of Eden
[58:04] what he said came to pass he had the
[58:11] mind of God that's what we're heading to
[58:16] that's what we're standing on the earth
[58:17] today comes remember Jesus never Jesus
[58:21] never walked out one day and said now
[58:23] now me and the Father we've been arguing
[58:24] back there behind the tent no he said
[58:27] whatever the father says that's what I
[58:28] did he and I are one there's no argument
[58:32] between us but we are hold on who argues
[58:36] with God we do we argue with God
[58:46] what no world are you doing
[58:49] but his doctrine must have been this is
[58:53] why that I we're gonna have to come to a
[58:55] word revival because the word is for the
[58:57] power is the word is where the Dunamis
[59:00] is the power to create listen the power
[59:05] to get those people out of the grave the
[59:09] power that Adam had that was born in the
[59:12] Old Testament that Jesus come as brother
[59:14] nails talking about Jesus came he came
[59:16] on the earth then he leaves and where
[59:19] does he send the power sends it back to
[59:20] the people
[59:22] drawing pulling drawing pulling drawing
[59:25] pulley
[59:28] first Corinthians 1 verse 18 excuse me
[59:33] for the preaching look of the Cross is
[59:36] to them that perish foolishness but unto
[59:39] us which are saved it is the Dunamis of
[59:43] God it is the power of God first Peter 1
[59:49] verse 3 blessed be the God and father of
[59:52] our Lord Jesus Christ which is according
[59:55] to his abundant mercy has begotten us
[59:57] again unto a lively hope by the
[1:00:01] resurrection of Jesus Christ from the
[1:00:02] dead to an inheritance there's that
[1:00:05] inheritant power to an inheritance
[1:00:07] incorruptible and undefiled and that
[1:00:11] fadeth not away reserved in heaven for
[1:00:15] you who are kept by the power our
[1:00:20] Dunamis of God through what faith unto
[1:00:24] salvation ready to be revealed in the
[1:00:27] last time we're here this is it now
[1:00:33] that's the inherent power to an
[1:00:35] inheritance incorruptible anything God
[1:00:39] gives you is incorruptible his word
[1:00:44] can't be corrupt
[1:00:46] we corrupt his word man corrupts his
[1:00:50] word we stop up the flues God doesn't
[1:00:53] stop up the flues his brother Chris long
[1:00:55] was talking about there's there's no
[1:00:57] conflict between Garden Satan nor the
[1:01:01] Creator the conflict between God and
[1:01:04] Satan is the person standing between God
[1:01:07] and Satan me and you we are the conflict
[1:01:11] but what Satan has said why I destroyed
[1:01:16] your word by them people right there and
[1:01:18] guards over here notice I said yeah I
[1:01:20] know that but I'm gonna bring it back
[1:01:23] right back through them amen I'm gonna
[1:01:28] bring it back right back through the
[1:01:29] same people that you think you destroyed
[1:01:34] bring it back and then we'll do it in
[1:01:40] your garden like brother like brother
[1:01:44] that's right like brother Aaron said
[1:01:47] said I'm God's God just slipped into
[1:01:49] Satan's even and just gonna bring out of
[1:01:52] people just like would have been
[1:01:54] standing in the Garden of Eden had there
[1:01:56] not been a fall but there had to be a
[1:01:58] fall there had to be a savior they had
[1:01:59] to be a healer a redeemer they had to be
[1:02:01] somebody come on the earth that's why it
[1:02:03] just makes so much sense that Adam could
[1:02:06] not come with an eternal body in the
[1:02:08] spirit along with the soul if he did he
[1:02:10] wouldn't never fail but in the condition
[1:02:13] he's in he fell because God had
[1:02:16] attributes we already know that we've
[1:02:17] been to message long enough who are kept
[1:02:20] by the power of God through faith in the
[1:02:21] salvation ready to be delivered in the
[1:02:24] last time so now we're going to cover
[1:02:26] just for a few minutes what the prophet
[1:02:29] of God said but let's turn to revelation
[1:02:31] 6 verse 8 because we've got to cover
[1:02:33] that other power which is exosphere now
[1:02:37] Dunamis power is an inherent power that
[1:02:39] is the power of God that is creative
[1:02:41] power and I looked and behold a pale
[1:02:44] horse and his name that sat on him was
[1:02:45] death and hell followed him and power
[1:02:47] was given unto them power was given to
[1:02:53] them over the fourth part of the earth
[1:02:56] to kill with a sword and hunger death
[1:02:58] and beast of the earth if you look all
[1:03:00] in the Book of Revelations every time
[1:03:01] God's talking about the devil he has to
[1:03:03] give him power so let's see what that
[1:03:07] power says though let's go to the next
[1:03:09] one the Greek lexicon says that power
[1:03:12] though is XOC a power which is power of
[1:03:16] choice liberty of doing this one pleases
[1:03:20] leave or permissive remember God has a
[1:03:25] perfect will and a what a permissive
[1:03:26] will physical and mental power the
[1:03:31] ability or strength which one is in dude
[1:03:33] which he either possesses our exercises
[1:03:36] they didn't say anything about
[1:03:37] inheriting a next we'll see a power is
[1:03:40] something that can come down upon you as
[1:03:42] God give the power to the four beasts to
[1:03:46] go out and conquer the world
[1:03:50] that's ecstasy of power look at person
[1:03:53] look at number nine let's see what
[1:03:54] brother Brown said about this testimony
[1:03:57] of a true witness 1961 his word
[1:04:00] testifies his word testifies in the last
[1:04:12] day that there will come a falling away
[1:04:15] now is that not happening and there
[1:04:18] would come up a cold formal powerless
[1:04:23] church age that's what we're living in
[1:04:26] folks that's what we got to overcome a
[1:04:28] church that had no power having a form
[1:04:32] of godliness but denying the power that
[1:04:33] up from search turn away he give the
[1:04:36] sign that there'd be times when a man
[1:04:38] was sitting the temple of God showing
[1:04:40] himself he was God he'd come ruling the
[1:04:43] nation's how perfectly all these things
[1:04:45] how God's Word has been perfect and
[1:04:47] remember King Nebuchadnezzar did the
[1:04:49] same thing all through the kingdoms
[1:04:51] let's scroll down to the bottom save
[1:04:52] time God's Word is a true witness and
[1:04:55] God's Word said in the last days they
[1:04:58] were compared less times men heart
[1:05:00] failing them for fear perplexity of
[1:05:02] times and distress between the nations
[1:05:04] and they'd come a falling away from the
[1:05:06] church and look men would rise up
[1:05:08] showing themself big dignitaries and so
[1:05:11] forth what big name preachers all right
[1:05:13] and what pile and would power away from
[1:05:16] the church and have a form of godless
[1:05:18] and deny the real power of God Church
[1:05:21] joining he spoke to the church getting
[1:05:22] in that condition we are a witness
[1:05:26] everybody say that we are a witness that
[1:05:31] the Word of God is fulfilled the church
[1:05:35] is in that if this was in 1965 61 the
[1:05:42] church is in that every organization is
[1:05:44] in that same state right now I'll
[1:05:46] challenge any man to show me any
[1:05:47] organization on fire for God oh they
[1:05:50] think they got revival oh no they don't
[1:05:52] because this last revival has to be a
[1:05:55] pure war
[1:05:56] revival you can't revive something
[1:05:59] that's dead
[1:06:00] it needs a resurrection I'll challenge
[1:06:05] any man to show me any organization on
[1:06:09] fire for God fill with the Holy Ghost
[1:06:10] with signs falling rising tell me one
[1:06:13] any organization there's no such a thing
[1:06:16] there it's not on the pages that's right
[1:06:18] they're all powerless and dead get it
[1:06:22] but he also prophesy thank you God for
[1:06:25] sending a prophet that gets us out of
[1:06:29] all this yeah clap your hands yeah
[1:06:34] thank God he sent us a prophet to get us
[1:06:36] out of this mess
[1:06:38] but he also prophesied there be a real
[1:06:41] Church in that day a little flock a
[1:06:44] remnant he said there would be and there
[1:06:47] will be that's the satellite there will
[1:06:53] be a people who know their God said the
[1:06:55] Prophet will do exploit in the last day
[1:06:59] thank God
[1:07:01] he said to be evening Lots in the last
[1:07:04] day the Prophet said so God's true
[1:07:09] witness said so there'd be evening lies
[1:07:11] what is an evening live the same as the
[1:07:14] morning live the Prophet said there'll
[1:07:16] be a day when it wouldn't be night or
[1:07:18] day of gloomy time outside just enough
[1:07:20] light to see where to get around how to
[1:07:21] get around but in the evening time it
[1:07:23] shall be like what would it be coming
[1:07:26] back going back to the early time
[1:07:29] there'd be even lights in the last day
[1:07:31] shining all right let's go to the bottom
[1:07:33] keep going look he said they'd be a
[1:07:38] prophet rise in the last day Malachi for
[1:07:43] giving the signs of the days of light so
[1:07:46] forth also prophesying for the people to
[1:07:49] return back turn back to the faith of
[1:07:52] the first Pentecostal fathers just
[1:07:54] telling the church downstairs we're
[1:07:55] going through the Book of Revelations no
[1:07:57] other prophet no other seven star
[1:08:00] messenger one of the seven not any of
[1:08:03] them but the last one was required to
[1:08:06] turn anybody back
[1:08:09] Lucca didn't turn the people back to
[1:08:11] Columbus message no Wesley didn't turn
[1:08:16] them back to Luther's where he'd be
[1:08:17] going backwards but in God that wasn't
[1:08:21] backwards because you got to go back to
[1:08:22] where you fell from so he said a prophet
[1:08:25] in the end time to take us all the way
[1:08:27] back to right here and then hitta he
[1:08:34] said that but it had to be because of
[1:08:36] what what felon if in those ages it
[1:08:39] wasn't the people it was the word that
[1:08:42] they had had no effect
[1:08:45] it was powerless because man had said
[1:08:47] it's novenas it's water baptism father
[1:08:50] son Holy Ghost it's three gods pray to
[1:08:53] the saint mary and saint sicilian and
[1:08:55] saint patrick sing whoever turn back to
[1:09:01] the original turn back to the bible get
[1:09:04] away from organization the denominations
[1:09:06] and go back to the first go back to the
[1:09:08] original Pentecost to the original
[1:09:10] filling of the Holy Ghost to the
[1:09:12] original Dunamis power of God the word
[1:09:16] testifies that that will happen I'll
[1:09:19] tell you before I told you before I'll
[1:09:20] tell you again XOC a power is okay but
[1:09:23] it will not get you out of a grave
[1:09:25] Dunamis power the power of God the only
[1:09:28] power is gonna get you alba grave or
[1:09:30] change your body brother Branham 1962
[1:09:35] all things what's this oh you said that
[1:09:38] you're taking under the Old Testament
[1:09:40] brother Branham all right let's go to
[1:09:42] the New Testament 2nd Timothy 3 the Holy
[1:09:44] Spirit warned us that in the last days
[1:09:46] that the church would get away from the
[1:09:48] sincerity and the faith I don't think
[1:09:51] he's talking about denominations at this
[1:09:53] moment I think he's gone about us the
[1:09:56] sincerity in the faith did have a form
[1:09:59] of godliness but would deny the power
[1:10:01] that went with the white right thing
[1:10:06] right things having a form of godliness
[1:10:08] but denying the power thereof yes sir
[1:10:10] God hates a powerless religion I want
[1:10:16] everybody to read that with me God hates
[1:10:18] a powerless
[1:10:20] religion and any religion today that
[1:10:23] hasn't got Christ in it it's powerless
[1:10:26] but any religion that Christ is in under
[1:10:29] his own blood and it's got power in it
[1:10:32] God hates the religion without power
[1:10:35] he's got said you say God hates the
[1:10:38] religion without power brother Branham
[1:10:39] what world you talking about he said
[1:10:42] your solemn feast as they stink
[1:10:44] I guess he does hate it he said it makes
[1:10:47] me sick cuz remember what is this age
[1:10:52] it's lukewarm he spews him out of his
[1:10:56] mouth makes him sick and remember he
[1:11:00] told us rich the latest in church
[1:11:01] because you're lukewarm in other words
[1:11:02] you make me sick I'll spew you out of my
[1:11:05] mouth and we've come to that age God
[1:11:08] send us an Isaiah to chop the thing to
[1:11:11] pieces I believe he did well lay it out
[1:11:13] before the people cry out spare not you
[1:11:16] think he'd be accepted certainly not but
[1:11:19] he'd cry just the same solemnly feast
[1:11:21] their stink
[1:11:22] God hates powerless religion it's got to
[1:11:25] have power in it it's got to have
[1:11:27] sincerity sincerity brings power
[1:11:33] sincerity brings real worship not forms
[1:11:38] but genuine wine Dunamis worship power
[1:11:42] to know that you've passed from death
[1:11:44] unto life God wants to perform his word
[1:11:47] by his power
[1:11:51] how can he perform and when the church
[1:11:54] denies his power that's what we're gonna
[1:11:56] talk about we'll stop right here that's
[1:11:58] what we're gonna talk about Wednesday
[1:11:59] night we'll pick it up I may read I may
[1:12:08] read one more God wants to perform his
[1:12:10] word by power when the church denies his
[1:12:12] power how can he perform and vindicate
[1:12:13] his word when the church explains it
[1:12:17] away you saw that's for the
[1:12:19] denominational people no that's the
[1:12:21] people in this message you can't get it
[1:12:23] right when the church explains it away
[1:12:28] and says this for some other day in
[1:12:30] something how can God who knows to
[1:12:31] fulfill his word and performance word
[1:12:33] among
[1:12:33] people people the people deny listen
[1:12:38] brother Dale can be 100% on the word
[1:12:41] which I believe he is and you all could
[1:12:43] die go to hell
[1:12:44] me included you gotta take what he said
[1:12:51] and live it and the people did not that
[1:12:58] he does it yet they go through all the
[1:13:01] rituals oh my lord
[1:13:03] one more number 11 and it won't stop
[1:13:06] right here hadn't even been going an
[1:13:07] hour mm-hmm God hates a powerless
[1:13:11] religion this is another quote brother
[1:13:13] Branham really emphasized you put in
[1:13:15] powerless and read hey he hate God hates
[1:13:18] powerless religion now remember though
[1:13:22] that power is not power for me to walk
[1:13:24] up and say oh you're healed you're not
[1:13:26] gonna have any bills everything's gonna
[1:13:28] be paid for you get a new Corvette sorry

[1:13:42] he was gonna kill me when I said
[1:13:44] Corvette sorry about that
[1:13:47] if you daddy wasn't here we would get
[1:13:50] you a Corvette but no it's not that's
[1:13:54] not the power we think that the power is
[1:13:56] gonna be though really is it one day
[1:13:58] we're gonna be just oh there's my
[1:14:04] mailman run I don't have any bills in my
[1:14:06] mailbox that's not it we listen you as a
[1:14:11] Christian don't survive because of that
[1:14:13] you survived because of the powerless
[1:14:14] inside of you you survived because of
[1:14:18] when you get up the morning doesn't
[1:14:19] matter if you got 25 bills you can't pay
[1:14:21] god you saved my soul you've saved my
[1:14:26] soul

[1:14:34] there's a good steward of your money
[1:14:35] right right that's right
[1:14:39] but God hates the powerless religion but
[1:14:42] now look the powerless religion is a
[1:14:45] word false war is a false word true word
[1:14:51] can't be powerless hello
[1:14:54] true word cannot be polished it's full
[1:14:57] of power but God hates the powerless
[1:15:01] religion
[1:15:01] it's got to be power certainly it's a
[1:15:05] power to save a man from sin it's a
[1:15:08] power that can do signs and wonders and
[1:15:10] miracles as jesus promised they zeroed
[1:15:13] in I'm talking about you and I they
[1:15:17] zeroed in on the Word of God back there
[1:15:20] and believed it and hit the target you

[1:15:28] prophet you zero the same way on the
[1:15:31] Word of God it'll hit the target again

[1:15:39] to because he's the same yesterday today
[1:15:41] and forever God don't like a powerless
[1:15:43] religion how many times I need to say it
[1:15:44] stays a brother Brown said that a
[1:15:47] hundred times God doesn't like a
[1:15:49] powerless religion God does not want
[1:15:52] that God wants to perform have you ever
[1:15:56] heard the statement this is gonna really
[1:15:59] flip you out listen everybody listen
[1:16:03] listen you got me God's waiting on earth
[1:16:15] God does not want that powerless God

[1:16:23] it again point at your neighbor
[1:16:24] uh-uh go like that's it God's waiting oh
[1:16:28] don't point at her lay by God wants to
[1:16:33] show herself alive listen people we live
[1:16:35] way under our privileges God wants to
[1:16:38] show itself alive how can he do that by
[1:16:41] the power of the spoken word our very
[1:16:47] hopes is in the resurrection is that
[1:16:50] right our hope of life its resurrection
[1:16:53] the resurrection of Jesus Christ
[1:16:57] everybody loved the Lord say Amen all
[1:17:00] right we'll read this one then we'll
[1:17:01] stop right here revelation of Jesus
[1:17:04] Christ Church AIDS book now remember
[1:17:07] this Christ in the true church now look
[1:17:10] true church not false Church true church
[1:17:15] Christ in the true church is a
[1:17:17] continuation of the book of Acts but the
[1:17:22] book of Revelation shows how that the
[1:17:24] Antichrist spirit would come into the
[1:17:27] church and defile it making it lukewarm
[1:17:31] formal and powerless it exposes Satan
[1:17:36] revealing his works attempted
[1:17:40] destruction of God's people and the
[1:17:41] discrediting look that this discrediting
[1:17:44] of God's Word is the devil's business
[1:17:47] listen he's he's got enough sense to
[1:17:50] know he can't do away with God's Word
[1:17:52] that man's got a lot of power but he
[1:17:55] tries to discredit the word right down
[1:18:00] to the time he is cast into the lake of
[1:18:01] fire he fights that he cannot stand it
[1:18:05] he knows that if the people at little
[1:18:08] church get the true revelation now I
[1:18:12] didn't make them big that's what the
[1:18:13] church age it the church age book makes
[1:18:15] that a big pump big font he knows that
[1:18:20] if the church gets the true revelation
[1:18:23] the true church and what she is not what
[1:18:27] she's going to be what she is what she
[1:18:31] stands for and that she can do the
[1:18:33] greater works she will be an invincible
[1:18:39] army if they get a true revelation of
[1:18:43] the two spirits within the framework of
[1:18:48] the Christian Church now what's the
[1:18:50] framework you see that you see that
[1:18:54] that's framework and you're sitting in
[1:18:58] it and there's two spirits sitting here
[1:19:00] today in the framework of this church if
[1:19:07] they get a true revelation of the two
[1:19:09] spirits within the framework of the
[1:19:11] Christian Church he's not talking about
[1:19:13] that Church over you under the believes
[1:19:15] father son hold no he's coming here if
[1:19:18] they get a true revelation of the two
[1:19:20] spirits within the framework of the
[1:19:22] Christian Church and by God's Spirit
[1:19:26] discern and withstand the Antichrist
[1:19:30] spirit Satan will be powerless before
[1:19:34] look at that word he didn't say him he
[1:19:37] said her he will be as definitely
[1:19:41] thwarted today as when Christ withstood
[1:19:43] his every effort to gain power over him
[1:19:45] in the desert now watch in the desert
[1:19:48] Jesus didn't use any power except the
[1:19:51] spoken words spoken words all he said if
[1:19:58] you be you know I'm supposed to tempt
[1:20:01] the LORD thy God if you did you're not
[1:20:04] supposed to do that
[1:20:05] finally the devil just said I'll deal
[1:20:07] with you later he will be as definitely
[1:20:10] thwarted today as when Christ was stood
[1:20:12] as every effort to gain power over him
[1:20:14] in the desert yes Satan hates revelation
[1:20:17] but we love it and with true revelation
[1:20:21] in our lives the gates of Hell cannot
[1:20:24] prevail against us but we will thank God
[1:20:28] for a prophet but we will prevail over
[1:20:31] them you will recall that I mentioned at
[1:20:35] the beginning of this
[1:20:36] is that this book we are studying which
[1:20:38] is the book of Revelation is the actual
[1:20:41] revelation of Jesus himself in the
[1:20:43] church and his work in the future age
[1:20:46] then I mentioned that it takes the Holy
[1:20:49] Spirit to give us revelation or we will
[1:20:52] fail to get it bringing these two
[1:20:56] thoughts together you will see that it
[1:20:58] won't take just ordinary study 20 minute
[1:21:01] sermons and thinking to make this book
[1:21:08] real it's going to take the operation of
[1:21:12] the Holy Ghost that means this book or
[1:21:16] this word revival cannot be revealed to
[1:21:20] anyone but a special class of people it
[1:21:30] will take one with prophetic insight
[1:21:34] it will require now when you take a
[1:21:37] study in school there are things that
[1:21:39] are required you can't jump around them
[1:21:44] if they're required you got to go
[1:21:46] through them it will take one with
[1:21:49] prophetic inside it will require that
[1:21:52] the ability to hear from God how you're
[1:21:55] going to hear from God through the word
[1:21:56] it will require supernatural instruction
[1:22:00] not just the student comparing verse
[1:22:02] with verse though that is good but a
[1:22:05] mystery requires the teaching of the
[1:22:08] spirit or it never becomes clear how we
[1:22:12] need to hear from God and lay ourselves
[1:22:14] open and become yielded to the spirit to
[1:22:17] hear and know we'll stop right there
[1:22:25] Wednesday night we'll speak on the River
[1:22:27] of Life because the problem the problems
[1:22:30] not the river let's stand our feet and
[1:22:31] musicians come the problem is not the
[1:22:34] river
[1:22:38] it's the logs
[1:22:41] they clog up the river you can't stop
[1:22:47] the river of life but you can plug it up
[1:22:51] a little bit that's what man has done
[1:22:53] they've dam to thing up and I mean not
[1:22:56] be am it up they dammed it up really
[1:23:00] they dammed the people daamn didi
[1:23:02] they've made they've made look those
[1:23:04] people are damned if they don't come to
[1:23:06] God they have the River of Life it's not
[1:23:11] flowing in their life if they're not
[1:23:13] born again and even if it's flowing in
[1:23:15] your life today you've still got logs of
[1:23:19] your own ideas or of your own this or of
[1:23:22] your of your something that you haven't
[1:23:24] your temperance and your patience and
[1:23:26] your godliness has not come to the place
[1:23:27] then what happened is that fluid or that
[1:23:30] part of that River has been clogged up
[1:23:33] we'll talk about that when see not let's
