[11:00] forgot to mention this morning even
[11:01] though you're not a father you have a
[11:03] father
[11:04] so either way happy Father's Day to
[11:08] somebody even though you're not a father
[11:13] okay
[11:14] I don't do that no more I don't read
[11:17] comic books that's of the devil but
[11:20] anyway now they come in our paper now
[11:25] and they're so distorted you can't read
[11:26] them so I don't know whether they're
[11:28] don't think I mean you can't hardly read
[11:30] you look at them you think man if I
[11:31] drunk something before are the papers
[11:34] moving you know cuz it's all double so I
[11:36] just forget it

[11:42] but happy Father's Day to all the to all
[11:45] the fathers a few announcements number
[11:49] ones like June sister June said the
[11:51] sisters who's happily going camping
[11:52] fishes are having a pity party they're
[11:55] having salad and a pizza and they're
[11:58] going to drown in their sorrow but most
[12:00] of them are gonna be happy that we're
[12:01] leaving I think this is like some kind
[12:02] of a hidden revelation hmm where they
[12:07] have a sad countenance until we leave
[12:10] huh no you didn't but you don't have to
[12:14] honey I agree between your line I bet

[12:23] the farewell wave will signal our
[12:27] pitiful commencement Terence didn't read
[12:29] that part the farewell wave will signal
[12:33] our pitiful commencement I think that
[12:36] means the less party when they are gone

[13:49] that that's a good number
[13:50] cabin number seven at 6:30 now I'm gonna
[13:54] explain one more time I explained what
[13:57] the Lowcountry ball was several weeks
[13:58] ago but obviously some don't listen a
[14:01] Low Country boil is we take and boil Low
[14:07] Country boil we take and boil shrimp
[14:10] crawfish crab legs
[14:13] andouille or those of you that don't
[14:15] know what I'm doing is that sausage hot
[14:19] sausage we didn't get the hot sausage we
[14:20] got the mild red potatoes corn on the
[14:24] cob onions and we put a little bit of
[14:28] lemon juice in there but anyway we boil
[14:30] it and cook it all together and then all
[14:32] you do is just scoop it out of the scoop
[14:34] it out of the pot pour it out on the
[14:37] table and eat
[14:39] that's a Lowcountry ball not a London
[14:42] brawl London broil is good but like
[14:46] Richard Robert said run London broil is
[14:48] good for one thing that's make beef
[14:50] jerky on it that's about it
[14:52] and also remember what the ones that are
[14:54] going up we need to get in our cars and
[14:56] get out of here as quick as we can but
[14:57] I'm gonna go get the tents I mean get
[15:01] the things rented some of you gonna stop
[15:03] and get license if you're over 16 you've
[15:06] got to have a Georgia fishing license 16
[15:11] and older yes if you are 16 you have to
[15:15] have a fishing license don't embarrass
[15:18] us by not having fishing license you
[15:20] don't embarrass yourself you embarrass
[15:22] all of us but there is a store once you
[15:25] turn to go to to glow state park there
[15:26] is a store right there that sells
[15:28] fishing license and supplies and all
[15:30] that other stuff so remember that also
[15:32] remember we're going to do something
[15:34] little bit different this year I'm
[15:35] announcing that real early camp meeting
[15:37] we used to go up on Friday night to the
[15:39] camp meeting at Terrence announced in
[15:41] August we are going up on Thursday men
[15:44] June and mom and brother Dale and
[15:47] brother Danny del mundo is gonna be here
[15:49] Wednesday night we're gonna carry him up
[15:51] and we're gonna spend the night Thursday
[15:52] night and be there Thursday and Friday
[15:54] and come back Friday evening so if you
[15:56] want to go on Friday you'll have to make
[15:59] your own arrangements to go or you can
[16:01] go up over there on Thursday but we got
[16:03] rooms at the Holiday Inn for us if you'd
[16:06] like to come we'd love to have you but
[16:07] it's gonna be a little bit different
[16:08] usually we go up on Friday and come back
[16:10] but we will be going up on Thursday and
[16:12] coming back on Friday so all right all
[16:14] mine's clear I know you remembered every
[16:16] bit of that mmm revelation 6 verse 5 and
[16:22] I titled this one a little I guess it's
[16:25] themed attic but I didn't put Father's
[16:28] Day as the Father's Day that's what
[16:32] we're under now we're in the Father's
[16:33] Day now remember we're going to where
[16:36] Jesus says sit on my throne
[16:38] as I said on my Father's throne that we
[16:41] ain't got to that yet
[16:43] that's coming up but we're on the
[16:46] father's part of of what comes remember
[16:50] what is the prayer our Father who art in
[16:55] heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom
[16:57] come thy will be done
[17:02] so we're under that father's day not a
[17:04] 24-hour day or a day to day on Sunday
[17:07] were under H we're under a 2000 year day
[17:10] of the father that this is what he
[17:12] wanted had there not been a fall is that
[17:14] all right the man so let's bow our heads
[17:17] do how many father we praise you be with
[17:18] us today in what we have to say and what
[17:21] we have to hear father you do the
[17:22] speaking you do the hearing Lord you're
[17:25] the only one that can reveal and without
[17:26] you being here today Lord truly it's
[17:28] just time to greet meet but no we're not
[17:31] doing that today we believe that this is
[17:33] eternal life and that you gave it to us
[17:37] freely we pray this should be with us
[17:39] now Lord at this whole time but we're
[17:41] going to take off for the father's day
[17:42] trip Lord we pray that you'd be with the
[17:44] ones that are having to travel to get
[17:47] there Lord that we have a good time in
[17:48] you Lord just be were the ones that are
[17:50] sick the ones that are not with us be
[17:51] with the missionaries give them
[17:53] blessings on the foreign fields be with
[17:55] the missionaries just coming in in July
[17:56] on August Lord just be with them take
[17:58] care of them so I'm going to be here
[17:59] Lord but we'll meet some at the camp
[18:01] Lord father we pray Lord hasten the day
[18:04] that we don't have to leave that we can
[18:05] all just assemble together and all be
[18:08] one in you here Lord and just be able to
[18:10] enjoy each other for millions and
[18:14] millions of years what no time but as we
[18:18] do depart Lord we pray today that you'd
[18:20] be with each one father just take care
[18:22] of us until we meet again Jesus name we
[18:24] pray amen and when he had opened the
[18:26] third seal now look we're talking about
[18:28] a black horse and man we've been talking
[18:30] about a black horse now I told him down
[18:32] in a Sunday School class we hit the
[18:35] ground running this morning buddy I'm
[18:36] telling you I did a they asked me to do
[18:39] a Brotherhood meeting at the Methodist
[18:42] Church this morning at 7:30 so I've been
[18:44] up since 7:00 seven o'clock this morning
[18:46] doing the Brotherhood meeting for some
[18:48] Baptists in some Methodists so they they
[18:51] got a little bit of what I'm gonna talk
[18:52] about today but but I was thinking you
[18:56] know you
[18:57] we're talking about death last Sunday
[19:01] must be dead right must be dead
[19:03] something had to die but in us we see
[19:06] that not something has to die something
[19:08] yes has to die but then there's life
[19:10] after that it's not death death death
[19:12] and death but it is to somebody that
[19:15] doesn't have the word it is to somebody
[19:17] that doesn't have life and not talking
[19:19] about the human life we're talking about
[19:20] the life that God give us and then so
[19:23] we're trying to take this black horse
[19:25] and show that it that there is a
[19:26] blackness in the land no doubt gross
[19:30] darkness the Bible says the people all
[19:33] right gross darkness the people not not
[19:36] just not just you know around the world
[19:39] it's in the people that's what the
[19:41] darkness is because we were talking
[19:43] about if not if that light and you be
[19:44] darkness how great is the darkness
[19:45] you're soakin see I've so deceived until
[19:48] you think what you've got is light but
[19:50] it's not and then I'll be holding the
[19:54] law of black horse and he that sat on
[19:55] him had a pair of balances in his hand
[19:56] and heard a voice in the midst of the
[19:59] four beasts say a measure of wheat for a
[20:00] penny and three measures of barley for a
[20:02] penny see thou hurt not the oil and the
[20:05] wine you may be seated in the Lord that
[20:06] is blessing to the reading of the word
[20:07] now what kind of background a little bit
[20:10] but I do want to cover something about
[20:14] this seal will not use the not used to
[20:20] drawing today because we just want to
[20:23] talk a little bit about something about
[20:24] the father because remember what did
[20:28] Jesus come to do he said I come to
[20:30] declare the Father okay you've seen me
[20:34] you've seen the father I and my father
[20:36] are one hey we got many scriptures that
[20:38] we're going to go over here all there's
[20:40] 854 times in the Bible that it talks
[20:43] about a father not father's or anything
[20:45] that father just father 854 times and
[20:49] 300 of those I think's in the New
[20:51] Testament
[20:52] so Jesus never spoke of himself remember
[20:54] he always spoke of the father all right
[20:56] so what did he do he come to declare the
[20:58] Father well now what are you and I to do
[21:02] we're not the father we're not the son
[21:04] of Jesus that son of the father right
[21:07] because remember we're heirs and joint
[21:10] heirs whatever he got we got alright so
[21:13] now let's look in see let's go and pull
[21:15] up with talking about Redemption now I
[21:17] was telling the Sunday School class
[21:19] downstairs you know Paul and Romans he
[21:22] concluded everyone dead everyone dead in
[21:26] sin everyone is everyone is on the same
[21:29] level and you know what I like that you
[21:32] saw no I like that because we're all of
[21:36] us on the same playing field we all got
[21:39] the same opportunity Judas me Adolf
[21:43] Hitler same opportunity we're all on the
[21:46] same level and to me that shows then the
[21:49] plan of redemption there is no
[21:50] redemption and realizing that you always
[21:53] was
[21:57] there's no redemptive quality I shout
[22:01] because God took me from being a sinner
[22:03] and made me a saint by the power as
[22:07] we're going to look at a little bit
[22:08] later the power of transformation our
[22:12] metaphor metamorphosis and then well the
[22:18] name we're going to get the name in the
[22:19] minutes Metamorpho that's taking an ugly
[22:23] caterpillar that always had the bug in I
[22:27] always had the butterfly inside you just
[22:29] couldn't see it but it always has the
[22:31] ability by being a caterpillar it always
[22:36] had the ability to be a butterfly if he
[22:38] did one thing eat one thing he had to
[22:44] eat and he eat his way into being a
[22:47] butterfly amen so that's the same way
[22:49] with you and I take an old ugly
[22:52] caterpillar like us a wretched sinner
[22:54] like us but yeah we did everybody that's
[22:58] what I love everybody in the world has
[22:59] the same opportunity everybody no one
[23:04] this born of a woman can get up one day
[23:06] in the white throne judgment and say God
[23:08] you can't do this because of this
[23:14] no way then we can all say that then we
[23:18] can all go up to the throne and have our
[23:20] little copy of all the things you know
[23:22] well you made me do this and you know no
[23:24] like I said before the only thing that
[23:28] they're going to the white throne
[23:29] judgment with is their works and that's
[23:33] it
[23:33] not of not God is not going to have a
[23:36] list of you did this good this day this
[23:38] no you turned me down you are an
[23:44] unbeliever it's believing or unbelieving
[23:49] I told him this morning in - at the
[23:51] men's breakfast I said look we have to
[23:54] believe in something we can't see I'm
[23:57] getting a little ahead of myself but
[23:58] I'll get to it in just a second but
[24:00] jesus said my father my father my father
[24:02] one day Philip I don't know where they
[24:05] had enough but Philip said you're
[24:09] talking about this other person and you
[24:13] know what Philip could say now Jesus I
[24:15] can go take you and show you who my
[24:16] father is I can take you and show you
[24:18] who my father is but now you're talking
[24:21] about a father that he's not anywhere to
[24:24] be seen
[24:25] Jesus said Philip have I been so long
[24:29] with you if you've seen me and that's
[24:33] what I told him at the breakfast him
[24:34] buddy their eyes got big I said you know
[24:35] what I said Jesus was lying if that
[24:40] wasn't the truth he said if you've seen
[24:42] me you have seen the father I said now
[24:45] Jesus is lying if I thought the truth
[24:47] bori their eyes got big cuz you have to
[24:50] be careful I was careful I didn't get
[24:52] into any doctrine but I did him to know
[24:56] that a I the Heavenly Father they cared
[25:00] about them just as much as I cared about
[25:01] us amen
[25:03] it's not us in them we'd be in the shape
[25:07] they're in if we didn't have what God
[25:11] that we moved on a little further and
[25:14] left those denominations and come out of
[25:16] those things
[25:19] but what's worse than them staying in
[25:22] there and living in all the life they
[25:24] can live in and that's leaving them
[25:25] denomination and become a denomination
[25:28] in this message if that lot in you be
[25:34] darkness how great is that darkness hey
[25:38] man so let's get in let's get into it
[25:39] just a little bit and we'll try to be
[25:41] finished here about 3:15 I'm trying to
[25:44] trying to figure out that time but the
[25:46] breaking of the COC is not for the soul
[25:47] the soul is redeemed by the new birth
[25:49] now we've been through that many times
[25:51] the mean times if you'll notice today
[25:52] though when I get to a certain point of
[25:54] the message you'll see this morning if
[25:56] you'll go back and watch brother Dale he
[25:58] come - right to a point stopped and went
[26:00] in another direction well that's where
[26:02] I'm coming to him going in that
[26:04] direction saying I'm een come down - he
[26:06] was getting ready to bring the same
[26:08] thing and then he went off not off on
[26:10] something else but he went to another
[26:11] subject so I swear the Lord works but
[26:14] the soul is redeemed by the new birth
[26:16] the shed blood of Jesus cross at Calvary
[26:18] but we're looking at full fellowship
[26:21] because Jesus and the father were one
[26:23] Jesus and the father never had a
[26:25] disagreement now in our spirit realm we
[26:31] have a disagreement but now in your soul
[26:33] if you're born again you can't disagree
[26:35] with God you can't disagree with the
[26:37] word so if you're continually
[26:41] disagreeing with what the word saying
[26:47] then where's the person if the person of
[26:51] the Holy Ghost is inside of you if the
[26:53] father which is the Holy Ghost it's
[26:55] going to come and dwell in you and he's
[26:58] contrary to the word cuz that's what
[27:00] Jesus said Jesus said you're acting like
[27:03] your father and I'm acting like my
[27:07] father you know what he was saying we
[27:10] have two different daddies that's what
[27:14] bothered him and I'm gonna read you here
[27:15] in the scripture to where they they
[27:17] perceived I don't know if you ever read
[27:19] that before they perceived oh we read it
[27:22] that he was saying he was God that's
[27:26] what made him mad cuz those remember
[27:29] when Jesus came to the Pharisees the
[27:32] Pharisees knew there was a
[27:33] only one God not three persons not a
[27:37] father a son and the Holy Ghost no that
[27:40] was one God one true God called even the
[27:43] one even the the Jew that brother
[27:47] branham was talking to remember the
[27:49] rabbi he said rabbi who will be the
[27:51] Messiah he said he'll we got so they
[27:54] know that see they had one God right
[27:58] before we split him up and they've still
[28:01] got him right they just know don't they
[28:03] just don't know that he's already come
[28:04] come into those different manifestations
[28:06] and left and come back in you and me
[28:11] okay
[28:12] so he hid himself in simplicity how much
[28:15] more simple can the word be amen but
[28:17] we'll bring full fellowship into
[28:19] manifestation and full fellowship is
[28:21] like what brother Dells been talking
[28:22] about your soul has got everything you
[28:25] need
[28:27] okay little Chloe back there she's how
[28:34] nine weeks old she's got every part in
[28:38] her to be a mother but don't put that -
[28:43] don't put that on her right
[28:46] not time she's not grown hey man Jonas
[28:50] where's Jonas Jonas in the back
[28:53] Jonas must have done something bless his
[28:55] heart pray for Jonas but Joe brother Joe
[29:02] Canada today you got little Jonas he's a
[29:07] man he's a man he's got everything he
[29:11] has to be a man but Joseph is not going
[29:14] to give him the keys and let him drive
[29:15] the car up to the to the park why he's
[29:20] not mature enough he had neat enough
[29:22] that's the same thing with being a
[29:24] Christian that's why that that we should
[29:26] not be as brother there was talk about
[29:28] we can't stay babies if you stay babies
[29:30] man what is going on that's not that's
[29:33] not that's not my will sure I would like
[29:36] for Deanna to stay ten years old lock
[29:37] her in right there but see that would be
[29:40] injustice going like this that would be
[29:42] a disservice to Deanna that would not
[29:45] make her a full
[29:46] all person sorry Josh she's gonna grow
[29:49] up you're gonna have heartaches and
[29:51] trials and troubles and bless your heart
[29:55] we'll be right there with you but that's
[29:58] what God you can't understand God
[30:00] without having the Holy Ghost to start
[30:02] with then you got to grow and you go
[30:05] that you get those aha moments I'll
[30:07] that's what you're talking about God oh
[30:08] that's what you're talking about Lord
[30:10] yeah that's what you're talking about
[30:11] that's Revelation see sometimes we think
[30:15] Revelation is just something that God
[30:16] you know one day you know and you know
[30:20] it's just those little things that you
[30:24] come to church either better or worse
[30:28] hello better or worse we come to church
[30:32] and we get some little something some
[30:36] little something from God well that's
[30:38] the father working through you because
[30:43] if you've seen me you've seen the father
[30:47] in our gene in our genetic makeup man
[30:52] I'm telling you I saw Tom Fuller's walk
[30:55] up this aisle you know hundreds of times
[30:58] right
[30:59] he had that certain you know what I
[31:04] can't walk like that because I don't
[31:05] have his genetic marker but Donnie go
[31:08] walk back there and walk up through here
[31:10] yeah you walk just lucky brother he's
[31:13] got that Sam you're doing it you know
[31:14] this is Tom with that foot kicked out
[31:21] like in well watch him same thing now
[31:26] he's he got older he's getting worse
[31:30] yeah exactly but all of us walk like our
[31:34] father in the genetic form of our
[31:38] natural birth so why not when the father
[31:41] comes in the form of the Holy Ghost that
[31:44] our walk is the same as that genetic
[31:46] makeup of that father
[31:50] hey man
[31:57] that's what the Holy Ghost is for so
[32:00] we're gonna skip through all this and
[32:01] get right to it and then we'll stop
[32:03] because remember full manifestation is
[32:06] what God wants in a group of people not
[32:10] just one person in a group of people all
[32:12] right and this and keep going let's
[32:14] going up go ahead and we don't read
[32:16] number one just keep going keep going
[32:18] keep going right there well I will
[32:25] restore or not reformed restore means
[32:30] he's going to actually take our genetic
[32:33] makeup in the gospel and change it
[32:37] because in no offense to the people I
[32:40] was talking to this morning but even the
[32:43] most baby simple things that we talked
[32:45] about what is is baffling to them why
[32:50] because the way they're taught what they
[32:53] eat what they eat and their genetic
[32:56] makeup not saying that they come from
[32:58] the devil no don't get me wrong but the
[32:59] genetic makeup of their denomination the
[33:02] denominational whatever they come
[33:05] through has told them this way to walk
[33:09] this is the way to dress this is a way
[33:12] to talk now is it the Heavenly Father I
[33:14] hope and pray that God shines down and
[33:17] shows them something especially from
[33:20] what I was trying to talk about today I
[33:21] I told him and they looked across out
[33:23] again and I said look I said why did we
[33:25] all do this Heavenly Father no I said
[33:30] the Bible said he'll be with you even in
[33:32] you
[33:32] I said Moses even told us in the Old
[33:35] Testament not to look over yonder look
[33:36] up you under look down here right
[33:39] he's right here I will restore not
[33:44] reformed the lamb is protected this seal
[33:47] which under this seal the black horse
[33:49] something must be dead that's what we
[33:52] were talking about last Sunday all right
[33:54] everybody okay with that say ma'am all
[33:56] right and we're gonna read that because
[33:58] in Romans 7 verse 1 no you're not
[34:03] brethren I speak to you they are they're
[34:05] known to law now that the law have to
[34:06] make
[34:07] over man as long as he liveth for the
[34:09] woman which hath an husband is bound by
[34:11] the law to her husband so long as he
[34:13] liveth but if the husband be dead she is
[34:16] loosed from the law of a husband now
[34:19] remember she is able to be married again
[34:22] so there is a life comes again yep
[34:26] listen if if a natural husband dies the
[34:31] physical wife doesn't die okay right the
[34:37] physical wife doesn't die she's alive
[34:40] but she's loosed from the law of that
[34:42] old husband and she's able to marry who
[34:46] she will only in the Lord only in the
[34:49] Lord but she's free to marry why because
[34:51] her old husband's dead he's not still
[34:53] hanging around he's not got a grip on
[34:55] her hey man
[34:57] but now remember I'm sorry we can't put
[35:02] Christ away we can't kill him why would
[35:07] you want to kill the eternal life and
[35:09] then married is something that's yeah
[35:11] that's what I thought that's why a woman
[35:14] can't marry again she's got a live-in
[35:17] husband she can't get married again but
[35:19] now a husband can't put her wife away
[35:21] for fornication that's what Christ did
[35:24] he put Israel away because of her
[35:27] fornicators Jonas you okay buddy okay
[35:31] mean mummy he put he put Israel away
[35:38] amen you'll grow up son don't worry he
[35:41] put Israel away she's still there and he
[35:44] married another the Gentile Church hey
[35:47] man he can do that we can do that but
[35:53] you sisters can't do that right now I'm
[35:55] not I'm not playing marriage and divorce
[35:57] here I'm just telling you what the Bible
[35:59] says because your type has to be what
[36:02] you are in the new birth because
[36:04] remember we're all feminists in the body
[36:06] of Christ I can't be married to a
[36:08] Methodist or a Baptist or a Pentecostal
[36:10] head and be married to cry
[36:14] cuz I'm a female I can't put him away
[36:17] he's got to be dead
[36:20] once he's dead once something dies then
[36:26] we're free for the woman which has the
[36:30] husband is bound by the law to her
[36:31] husband so long as he liveth but if the
[36:33] husband be dead she is loosed from that
[36:35] law
[36:37] we're loosed from the law when we get
[36:40] born again when we ask God to come in
[36:44] our heart in our life and come in and
[36:46] not just move stuff out of the way no
[36:49] kill it brother Graham said I'll look it
[36:53] up maybe next Sunday God let it die you
[36:56] know what a lot of our problem is is we
[36:58] feed the demons we feed the demons that
[37:02] we want to get rid of you know what you
[37:04] quit feeding that demon watch him die
[37:07] watch him die quit feeding that demon
[37:10] brother Brahim said how you gonna rather
[37:12] Brown them I have a stingy spirit he
[37:16] said now you got to get on your knees
[37:17] and go through the prayer line and have
[37:18] 12 quarts all poured on you he said no
[37:20] he said start giving stuff away
[37:23] he said do the vice versa for those of
[37:26] you that are not from the South by
[37:27] silver sea means do the opposite just
[37:32] for those that don't know what vice
[37:35] versa is but I'm quoting the prophet so
[37:37] did the vice versa t he didn't say good
[37:39] you know well you know what it done you
[37:42] quit feeding that demon and you started
[37:45] letting God control you started doing
[37:47] the opposite of what okay this thing's
[37:51] not complicated it's really not so then
[37:55] if while her husband liveth she be
[37:56] married to another man in other words if
[37:58] I try to put Christ away she shall be
[38:00] called an adulteress but if her husband
[38:03] be dead she is free from that law so
[38:07] that she is no adulteress though she be
[38:09] married to another man
[38:12] that's dead she can't be married to a
[38:16] living she can't be married and have a
[38:18] living husband that's what the Bible
[38:19] says all right wherefore my brethren you
[38:21] also look Paul's bringing it to you and
[38:25] I you also are become dead
[38:27] to the law by the body of Christ
[38:31] that you should be married to another
[38:33] even to him he was raised from the dead
[38:35] now you can't be married to another it
[38:38] just told you something's got to be dead
[38:41] it just told you something's got to be
[38:43] dead so it's not telling you you marry
[38:45] another just whatever you want to know
[38:47] if there's something that has died wait
[38:50] a minute where's Cathy Gable man she
[38:53] give me a pointer they're gone they have
[38:56] to leave okay well she gave me a book
[39:00] pretty neat huh okay it should be
[39:08] married to another even to him who is
[39:10] raised from the dead that we should
[39:11] bring forth fruit unto God now what does
[39:14] that mean that means you better have a
[39:16] personal relationship with this new
[39:17] husband you got it cuz fruit is children
[39:22] fruit of the Spirit if it's spiritual
[39:25] see that that we should bring forth
[39:27] fruit unto God for when we were in the
[39:29] flesh the motions of sin which were by
[39:32] the law did work in our members to bring
[39:35] forth fruit unto death that thing that
[39:37] brother Nell was talking about from the
[39:39] inside we were born dead we were born
[39:44] dead amen the reason we were born dead
[39:47] is because we were born in sin the
[39:48] motions of sin which were by the law did
[39:51] work in our members to bring forth fruit
[39:54] unto death but
[39:56] but everybody say but those of you that
[40:00] are sleep we're talking about but now I
[40:07] like Paul if Paul was to stop in a
[40:10] certain spot it like you had no hope
[40:14] we're doing that in Romans we're going
[40:16] through them going through and going
[40:17] through and if we stop at a certain
[40:18] place you're like we're dead
[40:20] Paul you ain't got us no way out but now
[40:24] we are delivered from the law that being
[40:27] dead wherein we were held bound by that
[40:32] old husband and remember that old
[40:35] husband was the dark horse the black
[40:38] horse that's what we were being held by
[40:40] amen
[40:41] we're when we were held that we should
[40:43] serve in the newness noon is something
[40:48] new something coming forth a new life a
[40:51] new nurse of spirit and not in the
[40:54] oldest of the letter but because
[40:56] remember Paul said the letter killeth
[40:58] but the spirit giveth life that all
[41:01] right say ma'am all right now let's go
[41:03] to Romans 6 verse 6 knowing this that
[41:06] our old man is crucified now when you
[41:09] put something on the cross it kills it
[41:12] no one ever come off of a cross alive
[41:15] they put you on there to kill you
[41:19] knowing that your old man is crucified
[41:21] with him that the body of sin might be
[41:24] destroyed now he's not talking about
[41:27] this body
[41:30] this was a product of sin but it doesn't
[41:33] sin I hope y'all keep we keep me and
[41:35] brother they'll both keep trying to tell
[41:36] you that forget about the flesh the
[41:38] flesh does not sin in itself it is a man
[41:42] it manifest what's already inside of you
[41:45] that the body of sin might be destroyed
[41:47] that henceforth we should not serve sin
[41:49] for he that is dead it's free from sin
[41:53] it's your dad you're free now if we be
[41:57] dead with Christ we believe that we also
[42:00] we shall also live with him amen
[42:06] dead alright let's go to Colossians and
[42:10] then we'll go we should be doing okay
[42:14] set your affections on things above not
[42:16] on things on the earth for your dad Paul
[42:19] what do you know you're talking about we
[42:20] are killing us
[42:21] amen amen
[42:25] like why Moody said I'll tell you again
[42:27] God will only fill those that are not
[42:29] full of this elf one more time God will
[42:33] fill those who are not full of themself
[42:36] okay
[42:39] because you know what that was Jesus's
[42:43] whole thing I'm dead and the father's
[42:48] alive I don't do anything unless what he
[42:51] tells me now listen it wasn't if the
[42:53] father said you can eat now that's not
[42:56] that's not it we know that his humanity
[42:59] he went through humanity had friends he
[43:02] had conversations and all those things
[43:04] and it wasn't that it sure God was
[43:07] talking but it wasn't like he said I
[43:08] only do what the father shows me the
[43:11] father didn't show him to eat everyday
[43:12] or you know do this no not everything
[43:15] you understand what I'm saying that's
[43:16] why you and I have to live life we have
[43:19] to live life okay for ye are dead and
[43:23] you're a lot wait a minute see this is
[43:27] like an oxymoron you are dead and your
[43:29] life you are dead and now you got a life
[43:36] something must have come up something
[43:39] must have had a resurrection they mate
[43:41] for ye are dead and your life is hid
[43:44] with Christ in God
[43:46] so therefore like I was saying this
[43:49] morning and brother Dale was saying the
[43:51] other day whatever Christ got whatever
[43:54] Jesus got we get he inherited eternal
[44:01] life we inherit eternal life amen
[44:04] 1st Timothy 5 verse 6 but she that
[44:07] liveth in pleasure is dead while she
[44:10] liveth and we know that we're talking
[44:12] and that listen you said ice
[44:14] denomination that's enough
[44:15] that's any idea you got and I got
[44:18] against the Word of God amen
[44:23] anything we have
[44:27] that we think is pleasure is dead
[44:30] well she liveth all right now let's look
[44:34] right here now and let's go this is the
[44:35] point I want to make for today and give
[44:37] me just a few more minutes would be okay
[44:38] is the power of transformation because
[44:42] the power of transformation God in the
[44:45] beginning
[44:46] here's Romans 12 now we're going to read
[44:50] this but I want to taste some of the
[44:52] power transformation listen the Genesis
[44:55] 1:26 man in the beginning does not need
[44:59] to be transformed he's perfect he's God
[45:06] that's the Holy Ghost you got living
[45:08] inside of you now that's the Christ that
[45:10] came on the earth that's the Christ that
[45:12] went through the Old Testament amen that
[45:14] okay there all right
[45:16] Genesis 1:26 man is God in another form
[45:21] let us make man in our image and then
[45:24] our likeness and let them have dominion
[45:25] over the fish and see in fact that's
[45:27] exactly what Adam did amen
[45:30] so the power of transformation means
[45:33] that we did had to have a metamorphose
[45:35] oh it's up in a minute we had to have a
[45:38] metamorphosis happen we had to go from
[45:40] one stage to another state y'all come on
[45:44] in they got visitors today
[45:47] Bob black and his wife and all they
[45:51] little cheering glad y'all could make it
[45:55] today make sure you turn the cameras on
[45:57] his red face for you he had to go get
[46:05] his kids I'm up here I'll talk about
[46:06] they had to go get his kids so that's
[46:08] okay that's fine I'm just kidding but
[46:10] look the power of transformation then
[46:12] there had to be once there's a fall we
[46:14] had to be transformed back
[46:19] something had to happen there had to be
[46:21] a there had to be a transformation and
[46:23] there's only one person look Bob when I
[46:25] got look there had to be what enough
[46:31] power to transform us back to me that's
[46:34] what the seal to me that's what the
[46:37] seals are doing that gives us the power
[46:40] we've got the power but he gives us the
[46:43] ability to use the sword and then we got
[46:47] the sword we got the word we need the
[46:50] power to use it
[46:53] it's what brother branham said brother
[46:55] branham said now it takes a strong hand
[46:57] to faith he had the sword in his hand
[47:00] and it fit perfect but he said it takes
[47:02] the strong hand of faith to go toward
[47:04] the enemy you can have the best you have
[47:07] the best sword in the world but if I
[47:08] never was a swordsman and I walked up to
[47:10] a swordsman he can get a pocketknife and
[47:12] kill me with it and I can have a big
[47:14] long sword this long why because he's
[47:16] got the ability he studied he's went to
[47:19] church he's read the message he's let
[47:23] God revealed things to him so the power
[47:26] of transformation let's look at this
[47:27] real quick and then we'll then we'll
[47:29] close Romans 12 verse 1 I beseech you
[47:32] therefore brethren I smile like Romans
[47:34] you see we're still in Romans we having
[47:36] a good time in the sentence good class
[47:38] for Romans I really see more as the
[47:40] seals come I'm not finished with that
[47:42] yet as back there I beseech you
[47:47] therefore brethren by the mercies of God
[47:49] that you present your bodies a living
[47:51] sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which
[47:54] is your reasonable service and be not
[47:56] conformed to this world because remember
[47:59] we were conformed to this world when we
[48:00] came in flesh hello
[48:03] we were conformed to this world when we
[48:06] came into human flesh through the womb
[48:08] of our mother by the act of our mother
[48:10] and father that wasn't what it was
[48:12] supposed to be amen but be ye
[48:18] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[48:22] that you may prove what is that good and
[48:25] acceptable and perfect will of God good
[48:30] acceptable and perfect will of God
[48:32] God must be pleased when something
[48:33] happens and then so now let's look at
[48:35] what that word transformed means in the
[48:39] Greek it means Metamorpho our
[48:43] transfigure are to change into another
[48:46] form to transform a transfigure and
[48:49] that's what's happening with us from the
[48:52] inside the butterflies goes to work the
[49:00] old caterpillar excuse me the old
[49:02] caterpillar you see that thing going up
[49:04] a tree it's just as ugly as Bob black it
[49:07] is just ugly Isaiah 53 says no beauty
[49:15] that we should desire him same thing
[49:19] with us no beauty that God would desire
[49:22] us because we're there so caterpillar
[49:24] and we just like like brother Joel says
[49:26] we just go to the next leaf but inside
[49:32] is working the butterfly that's inside
[49:36] is working something that it's the most
[49:38] beautiful thing that I've ever seen
[49:40] flying is the butterfly it's so graceful
[49:43] and it's just so light and it's got so
[49:45] many different colors well it used to be
[49:47] an ugly worm hey you should be an ugly
[49:50] worm same thing with you and I will use
[49:53] me an ugly old worm but inside of us
[49:55] with a Metamorpho are a metamorphosis
[49:58] changing into another form alright so
[50:02] now let's go to the next and let's read
[50:07] John one to watch we know what John 1:1
[50:12] says in the beginning was word words was
[50:14] the Garden word was gone now look he
[50:15] came into his own and his own received
[50:17] him not but as many as received him
[50:20] there's your choice to them gave he
[50:23] power to become the sons of God even to
[50:28] them that believe on his name which were
[50:30] look which were born not a blood jesus
[50:33] said Nicodemus you must be born again
[50:36] Nicodemus says I got to go back in my
[50:39] mother's blood and my mom in the flesh
[50:42] and be born jesus said
[50:45] no you need a new one that's why they
[50:49] call it an uber you need a new one
[50:51] because your first one wasn't worth
[50:53] anything it just got you here and got
[50:55] you breathing so you can manifest
[50:57] somebody the devil or God one of the two
[50:59] which were born not of blood nor of the
[51:02] will of the flesh your natural birth nor
[51:06] of the will of man but of God which were
[51:09] born take all that out which were born
[51:11] of God and the Word was made flesh oh
[51:16] that was Jesus
[51:19] that wasn't just Jesus and the Word was
[51:25] made flesh and dwelt among us he had to
[51:27] be the first one - that happened - he
[51:30] was the word that word was made flesh
[51:32] and as brother Branham says he says word
[51:35] becoming flesh flesh becoming the word
[51:37] because we're working back toward this
[51:39] way the flesh is becoming the word now
[51:41] the word was made flesh so that what he
[51:44] can make a way for us to get back and
[51:46] then and the word was made flesh see
[51:47] this is just like brother Dale saying
[51:49] this morning this is really just simple
[51:51] salvation it's got to start that way but
[51:56] taking simple salvation you just keep
[51:58] adding on add known I'd known you keep
[52:01] feeding Jonas and then about how old is
[52:04] he 6 5 ok in 11 years he can drive but
[52:11] he's got 11 years for growing to do jobs
[52:14] none will give him the key tonight let
[52:15] him drive up to the to the park please
[52:18] I'm not gonna be in front or behind him
[52:21] but you see that then God knows that God
[52:25] knows that about me and you
[52:27] he's not gonna dump it all on you at the
[52:30] same time amen but some of us to make
[52:33] ourselves available more than others I
[52:34] say some of us I'm gonna come with me
[52:36] I'm said some of us make herself more
[52:38] available because mama was driving when
[52:41] she was 14 she was able she wasn't
[52:44] supposed to but she was able I would say
[52:47] way back then they didn't have a law for
[52:48] that but I'm not gonna go there and the
[52:51] word was made flesh and dwelt among us
[52:53] and we beheld his glory the glory the
[52:56] only begotten of the Father full of
[52:57] grace and truth
[52:59] no man has seen God at any time that's
[53:04] the Bible got it that's the Bible no man
[53:07] has seen God at any time the only
[53:11] begotten Son which is in the bosom of
[53:14] the Father he hath declared him that's
[53:17] what he's trying to tell Philip so let's
[53:18] go to another scripture John 5 verse 17
[53:21] but jesus answered and said unto them my
[53:24] father worketh hitherto and I work now
[53:27] look to me excuse me the fellowship that
[53:32] we lost listen to me for saying the
[53:35] fellowship we lost Jesus proved that it
[53:39] could be brought back when he came earth
[53:42] and him and his father were in so much
[53:44] not to people you understand what I'm
[53:45] saying we know that I don't have to
[53:46] explain that wedding to people my father
[53:51] worketh hitherto and I work now see that
[53:53] should be you and I say in that
[53:58] therefore the Jews sought the look Jesus
[54:01] said one thing my father worketh in I
[54:04] work they interpreted exactly right
[54:08] because they said look the Jews sought
[54:10] the more to kill him because he not only
[54:12] broke the Sabbath but he all but said
[54:15] also that God was his father making
[54:18] himself equal with God that's what they
[54:21] were trying to kill him for and listen
[54:25] the believability of that is
[54:27] unbelievable that we can do that the
[54:32] believability of that is unbelievable
[54:34] because we got to believe something that
[54:37] we shouldn't have to believe look at
[54:40] that that we are equal with God now he's
[54:43] one who told us that we did
[54:45] he's one told us that then Jesus said
[54:48] then answered Jesus and said unto them
[54:50] verily verily I say unto you the son can
[54:53] do nothing of himself but what he seeth
[54:55] the father do for what things whatsoever
[54:58] he doeth these also doeth the son
[55:01] likewise now that's back to full harmony
[55:04] that's back to where Adam was in the
[55:06] Garden of Eden
[55:08] he's the second atom right and man he
[55:11] was the atom that was supposed to
[55:13] fulfill all this this man right or atom
[55:17] was supposed to fulfil all this this
[55:18] second atom coming full field every bit
[55:20] of it cuz this second atom is going to
[55:23] take us back to the Garden of Eden and
[55:25] then this second atom is going to
[55:27] literally take us back to the Garden of
[55:29] Eden hey man all right now st. John 6
[55:32] verse 46 not that any man hath seen the
[55:37] father say he which is of God he has
[55:42] seen the father
[55:43] oh that's just Jesus I thought we were
[55:49] children of God I thought we were of God
[55:53] so we've seen the father not that any
[55:57] man has seen the father save he which is
[56:00] of God he hath seen the father you and I
[56:06] have seen the father we know who we're
[56:11] talking to when we talked to that person
[56:14] not a third person talking to a second
[56:16] trying to get to a first John 8 verse 19
[56:20] then said they unto Him where is the
[56:23] father you know all of them standing
[56:27] around could go on father's day hey I'm
[56:28] gonna go see my father and Jesus is like
[56:31] I am the father I'm the father made
[56:38] benefit then said they unto Him where is
[56:41] my father jesus answered you neither
[56:44] know him know me nor my father if you
[56:48] had known me now Jesus is lying if he's
[56:52] not telling the truth if ye had known me
[56:56] you should have known my father also why
[57:00] because we walked the same yeah we got
[57:03] the same genetic code they just didn't
[57:06] believe that was who that was hey man so
[57:09] it comes back to believe John 10 verse
[57:11] 28 this is where brother Dale was
[57:15] heading to this morning and he diverted
[57:17] or the Lord diverted him because I was
[57:19] going to read all these scriptures right
[57:20] here
[57:21] John 10 verse 28 and I give unto them
[57:24] eternal life and they shall never perish
[57:27] neither shall any man pluck them out of
[57:30] my hand
[57:31] who's talking Jesus my father which gave
[57:36] them me is greater than all now there is
[57:40] where brother Dale somebody he gave
[57:41] honor because he was in human flesh
[57:43] he gave honor to that that was inside of
[57:45] it
[57:46] amen so Jesus wasn't all over the world
[57:50] he wasn't he was one man standing in one
[57:53] place amen my father which gave them me
[57:56] because remember that was his
[57:57] dispensation that's what he was he was
[57:59] in my father which gave them me is
[58:02] greater than all and no man is able to
[58:05] pluck them out of my father's hand now
[58:07] there's not two hands he just tells you
[58:11] right here if there's listen here's the
[58:14] love letter listen folks if there's any
[58:16] doubt this is between 29 and 30 if
[58:18] there's any doubt about Who I am I and
[58:21] my father one if there's any doubt I'm
[58:24] gonna tell you it's not a father's hand
[58:26] in my hand I and my father are one
[58:30] how good is that all right let's go to
[58:36] the next one Thomas entered him Lord we
[58:41] don't know whether they going and how
[58:44] can we know the way Jesus sent unto him
[58:47] I am the way the truth and the life no
[58:50] man cometh unto the father but by me if
[58:55] you had known me you should have known
[58:59] my father also now look and from
[59:05] henceforth you know him and have seen
[59:08] him
[59:13] now watch Philip didn't get it Philip
[59:18] didn't have the Holy Ghost but what got
[59:19] what's God saying hold on God's saying
[59:22] that right here you're gonna get the
[59:24] Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost I'm
[59:27] going to come back and I'm going to give
[59:28] you this revelation that I'm talking
[59:30] about here and you're gonna see him if
[59:35] you've seen me you've seen the father
[59:37] our Philip said Lord now here's the
[59:39] carnal part of man Philip said Lord
[59:43] you're talking about this father where
[59:46] is this man
[59:49] like I said Philip Philip can go back to
[59:51] Philip senior and go hey this is my
[59:53] daddy Jesus is talking about his daddy
[59:56] and everybody's going well where's he
[59:58] going to show up at Philip said unto me
[1:00:02] Lord show us the father and other words
[1:00:04] it'll satisfies in other words we got a
[1:00:06] problem with what you're saying we're
[1:00:08] not satisfied with what you've been
[1:00:11] talking about suffice mean satisfied
[1:00:14] jesus said unto Him have I not been so
[1:00:16] long with you and yet hast thou not
[1:00:19] known me Philip he that hath seen me
[1:00:22] hath seen the father and how sayest thou
[1:00:26] show us the father believe it's now not
[1:00:30] that I am in the father and the father
[1:00:32] in me wait a minute I am in the father
[1:00:36] and the father in me they're not going
[1:00:40] back and forth like this
[1:00:41] no they're less okay
[1:00:46] we're gonna move it oh the words that I
[1:00:48] speak unto you I speak not of myself but
[1:00:51] the father that dwelleth in me he doeth
[1:00:54] the words believe me that I am in the
[1:00:58] father and the father in me
[1:01:00] or else believe me for the very works a
[1:01:03] very barely I say unto you he that
[1:01:05] believeth on me the works that I do
[1:01:08] shall he do also and greater works than
[1:01:11] these shall he do because I go unto my
[1:01:13] father what I come from God I go back to
[1:01:16] God when he went back to God he came
[1:01:18] down in a mini membered body and started
[1:01:21] doing his work that's the father's
[1:01:23] Kingdom thy kingdom come Thy will be
[1:01:26] done in earth and then and whatsoever
[1:01:31] you shall ask in my name that will I do
[1:01:35] that the father may be glorified in the
[1:01:39] son
[1:01:40] if you shall ask anything in my name I
[1:01:44] will do it if you love me keep my
[1:01:46] Commandments and look and I will pray
[1:01:49] the father and he shall give you another
[1:01:51] comforter that he may abide with you
[1:01:55] forever even the Spirit of Truth no
[1:02:02] spirit of error I'll give you the Spirit
[1:02:05] of Truth whom the world cannot receive
[1:02:08] because it seeth him not now that's not
[1:02:11] physical eyes see means to understand
[1:02:17] remember a little while in the world see
[1:02:20] me no more but you'll see me now I've
[1:02:21] never seen Jesus Christ that walked on
[1:02:25] the shores of Galilee they hung on cross
[1:02:27] never saw him before but I believe who
[1:02:31] he was and the same spirit that was in
[1:02:33] him than me that means I'm seen
[1:02:37] understand right see that to me that's
[1:02:40] the fellowship the fellow the only way
[1:02:42] that
[1:02:45] I'm word this right the only way that
[1:02:48] Jun and I can have true Fellowship is to
[1:02:50] know each other I don't mean in the
[1:02:54] nobody wonders what to think
[1:02:57] conversation talk know each other okay
[1:03:00] the only way we can have a closeness is
[1:03:02] to know each other same way with God how
[1:03:07] you gonna know him if you don't talk to
[1:03:08] him how you gonna know him if you don't
[1:03:10] read his word how you gonna know him if
[1:03:13] you don't study but I've got the Holy
[1:03:16] Ghost brother yeah you got the Holy
[1:03:17] Ghost but you got it bound you got it
[1:03:22] bound because that see of him not
[1:03:28] neither knoweth him now that part we can
[1:03:33] talk about that because Jesus said
[1:03:35] you'll come up today and said said unto
[1:03:37] cashed out Devils and done all these
[1:03:38] mighty works and he said Department from
[1:03:39] me I never knew you what I never had an
[1:03:41] intimate relationship you know what he's
[1:03:43] saying and I'm just gonna be frank cuz
[1:03:46] this is exactly what it is you've never
[1:03:49] let me in the womb of your mind you've
[1:03:53] never let me plant the word in the womb
[1:03:55] of your mind and you bring forth fruit
[1:03:59] like you're supposed to do that's
[1:04:01] exactly the truth that's why God has to
[1:04:03] get in the womb of our mind he doesn't
[1:04:05] care about the womb of our whatever else
[1:04:07] but the womb of our mind he doesn't get
[1:04:09] it but you say no you don't think we'll
[1:04:11] your brain remember that Satan's
[1:04:14] territory you think we're heart out of
[1:04:17] the heart proceed if all things and then
[1:04:21] even the Spirit of Truth whom the world
[1:04:22] cannot receive because it seeth him not
[1:04:24] neither knoweth him but you know me for
[1:04:29] he dwelleth with you and shall be in you
[1:04:32] now if the father at least I'm not the
[1:04:34] father
[1:04:35] so if the father's in you and Jesus said
[1:04:38] I'm gonna come in you and now we're
[1:04:40] gonna bring the Holy Ghost in fill me
[1:04:43] out Lord let you know what there's no
[1:04:46] room for nobody else if you got it right
[1:04:49] I can say it the Father Son Holy Ghost
[1:04:51] dwells inside of me if you got it right
[1:04:54] hey man hey man
[1:04:57] because I'm I'm too full of myself I
[1:05:00] can't let them in their.what moody said
[1:05:03] that I think I will not leave you
[1:05:04] comfortless I will come to you yet a
[1:05:08] little while in the world see if me
[1:05:09] nobody eat no more but ye see me because
[1:05:13] I live you shall live also in other
[1:05:16] words there was a death now there is a
[1:05:19] life and that day brother I'm said
[1:05:22] that's this day you shall know that I am
[1:05:27] in my father and he and me and I in you
[1:05:30] he's a man that's four people running
[1:05:33] around
[1:05:34] well three people and then you got to
[1:05:36] add the Holy Ghost in a minute come on
[1:05:40] ain't but one God there's only one
[1:05:43] manifestation there's only one you
[1:05:45] understand what I mean for us and that's
[1:05:47] the Holy Ghost in our life and then
[1:05:49] because this is the dispensation of what
[1:05:51] the Holy Ghost and then the Son of God
[1:05:54] revelation now we come into son of man
[1:05:56] we got that that's on the fourth seal
[1:05:59] cuz a revelation of the Son of Man
[1:06:02] listen we live under the revelation of
[1:06:06] the Son of God we've already been
[1:06:07] through this right we do get the
[1:06:09] revelation of son of man but that comes
[1:06:10] to the body change call the Son of man
[1:06:13] took the body change son of god didn't
[1:06:14] take a body change it sound of god don't
[1:06:16] need a body change the son of god is
[1:06:17] what makes the body change amen
[1:06:21] alright let's go real quick what's the
[1:06:27] next one this is the last one right here
[1:06:31] but the comforter which is the Holy
[1:06:33] Ghost now he told us before that the
[1:06:36] father was going to send the comforter
[1:06:38] so now he's identifying who this
[1:06:41] comforter is which is the Holy Ghost
[1:06:43] whom the father will send in my name he
[1:06:51] shall teach you all things and bring all
[1:06:55] things to your remembrance whatsoever I
[1:06:58] have said unto you peace I leave with
[1:07:02] you my peace I give unto you not as the
[1:07:04] world giveth give I unto you let not
[1:07:08] your heart be troubled neither let it be
[1:07:09] afraid I'm talking to you
[1:07:11] today you have heard how I said unto you
[1:07:14] I go away and come again unto you if you
[1:07:18] loved me you would rejoice because I
[1:07:21] said I go unto the Father for the father
[1:07:23] is greater not in other words you know
[1:07:25] what he's saying if I stay here I can't
[1:07:29] do the work that I'm supposed to do
[1:07:31] if I stay here now hit last John 14 he
[1:07:35] was still alive hadn't been to Calvary
[1:07:37] right so if he stayed in that spot you
[1:07:41] know if that's what I said if you don't
[1:07:42] understand what I'm saying I'm gonna
[1:07:44] tell you if if Satan would have left
[1:07:47] Jesus alone he would have been trapped
[1:07:49] in that body and died a natural death
[1:07:53] but Satan said no I'm gonna kill him
[1:07:55] well through Caiaphas he said I'm gonna
[1:07:58] kill him and when he killed him he made
[1:08:01] him greater did one Jesus then you know
[1:08:04] 121 Jesus is now the three thousand
[1:08:07] Jesus is now there's three million Jesus
[1:08:08] amen so Satan bless his heart everything
[1:08:11] he touches
[1:08:12] they just don't turn out good for him
[1:08:14] but you know what that's all right with
[1:08:18] as much heartache and trial he's give us
[1:08:19] he deserves every bit of it
[1:08:22] amen but we don't have a father today
[1:08:25] folks that has gone away and it's not
[1:08:28] here he's right here to do the work he
[1:08:33] is on his throne doing what he's
[1:08:35] supposed to do he is not a what was I
[1:08:40] tell him this morning he's not something
[1:08:42] that goes on vacation or some you can't
[1:08:44] get on the phone and say hey Dad I need
[1:08:45] something well bad cell service no no no
[1:08:53] listen
[1:08:53] God's Wi-Fi always works you don't need
[1:08:57] a wire it always works and it never goes
[1:09:01] recalculating no at Legion guides and
[1:09:06] all truth that third seal is so
[1:09:08] important to me because it proves to me
[1:09:11] one thing if you don't have the Holy
[1:09:13] Ghost you're not gonna take a body chain
[1:09:15] you are not going to understand the full
[1:09:17] plan of God and you're lost you're black
[1:09:23] that's what that black horse that black
[1:09:26] horse though now though bet so deceptive
[1:09:28] that black horse is riding through the
[1:09:30] land telling people you're okay you're
[1:09:34] good you're fine
[1:09:35] go where you ain't gotta go Church you
[1:09:42] know what they told me at one church it
[1:09:43] was an on my excellent church wasn't a
[1:09:45] message Church but they said we don't
[1:09:46] have Sunday service we don't have Sunday
[1:09:48] service even the service anymore so the
[1:09:51] families can get together I said my
[1:09:54] family gets together at church service
[1:09:56] hey man I said my family gets the I said
[1:09:59] what are y'all gonna do drink beer and
[1:10:00] watch television you can talk to some of
[1:10:06] them like that some of them you can't
[1:10:07] talk to them look I didn't say that
[1:10:08] today but what is the what's the deal
[1:10:11] the deal is we're trying to get together
[1:10:14] as a family you know why we getting you
[1:10:17] know why you get together as a family
[1:10:18] because she was born in the family and
[1:10:21] then you were born that way and then we
[1:10:24] were when we died in Christ and was Reza
[1:10:28] brought back alive what did it bring us
[1:10:32] into the whole new world a whole new
[1:10:35] world totally contrary to this world
[1:10:38] that we're living in I mean we're living
[1:10:40] in two dimensions already hey man our
[1:10:44] soul is living in a dimension of
[1:10:46] perfection you know what we you don't
[1:10:48] excuse me you know what we got to do
[1:10:51] you got to get the pieces to match
[1:10:53] somebody preach the sermon on that
[1:10:55] twenty something years ago but when they
[1:10:59] see these seals to me it's showing the
[1:11:02] complete plan of redemption it's the
[1:11:06] most simple I don't understand why
[1:11:10] people can't understand that it's so
[1:11:12] simple but yet it's so deep so that you
[1:11:17] know why it's deep its deep because they
[1:11:19] ain't got past one plus one is two
[1:11:23] they've they've not went on to the
[1:11:25] algebra class or the and you know what
[1:11:27] it's there it's at your disposal is at
[1:11:30] my disposal that's what these seals are
[1:11:32] for let's stand our feet that's what
[1:11:34] these seals are for now what are we
[1:11:37] supposed to do we're supposed to do just
[1:11:38] like Jesus and declare the Father and
[1:11:42] then they'd not be to listen did not be
[1:11:44] to people jesus said if you've seen me
[1:11:48] you've seen the father I and my father
[1:11:51] are one
[1:11:52] I come from God I go back to God that's
[1:11:57] me and you folk that's us
[1:12:09] there's only one father they can come
[1:12:11] and give his life and then not come back
[1:12:15] into just one person but a mini membered
[1:12:18] body because he knew every one of us
[1:12:21] before the foundation of the world he
[1:12:24] knew what we would choose and these
[1:12:29] sales are bringing us back closer if you
[1:12:32] listen I'm telling if you don't feel
[1:12:34] closer to God now than you did before
[1:12:36] then you're you're falling behind and
[1:12:39] you say oh I don't know look just like
[1:12:41] what in Romans the book of Romans we've
[1:12:46] been in the book of Romans now for a
[1:12:47] while only on the 3rd chapter but didn't
[1:12:53] didn't we saw Luis today but we saw the
[1:12:56] seals right we saw the seal that opened
[1:12:59] in that book of Romans the 3rd chapter
[1:13:02] the justified part remember it the
[1:13:06] justification sanctification about tears
[1:13:08] of the Holy Ghost has to be interlaced
[1:13:10] into the in the scripture because that's
[1:13:12] where we get our doctrine from Scripture
[1:13:15] we don't get our doctrine from somebody
[1:13:17] another book our doctrine we do have a
[1:13:20] doctrine it's in the Bible the doctrine
[1:13:23] is in that Bible you know what it's what
[1:13:26] changes us you know what they've also
[1:13:28] proven I was gonna tell you this before
[1:13:30] they have proven that godly sent in the
[1:13:33] outer space that lived in the space
[1:13:35] station for so long when he came back
[1:13:37] what happened he changed his DNA right
[1:13:41] Aaron read the article I read the
[1:13:43] article he stayed out in space for so
[1:13:45] long until it started changing his DNA
[1:13:49] they took another test and it was
[1:13:50] changing his form
[1:13:53] I thought we were supposed to be living
[1:13:57] in heavenly places and I think that's
[1:14:01] what changes our DNA let's sing a song
[1:14:05] hey man that's what changes us sing a
[1:14:10] little medley we always sing starting
