[6:41] the house of the Lord if you'd like to
[6:43] turn in your scriptures turn back where
[6:44] we've been reading Matthew
[6:47] 5 and then we will go to Exodus 12
[6:52] Matthew 5 in Exodus 12 now remember the
[6:55] Bible study will be this coming Saturday
[6:58] 6:00
[7:00] and just be much in prayer come and be
[7:02] with us it' be common questions in other
[7:03] words ORD there questions right off the
[7:06] the floor and you know we've had been
[7:08] having a good time doing that just
[7:10] talking about things that's on the
[7:12] people's heart so remember that all
[7:14] remember then the uh next
[7:18] Wednesday the 18th brother Aaron will be
[7:21] taking the services here for us on
[7:23] Wednesday because uh Wade and Zach and
[7:26] Donnie and myself will be over in
[7:28] Alabama hunting so so just remember that
[7:31] and pray that the Lord would would bless
[7:33] us and take care of us and give us a
[7:35] good time in him remember those now
[7:37] Terrence made the announcement too about
[7:39] the changing the date of the uh banquet
[7:44] that we have so we had to change that
[7:47] because of uh brother Daniel G Diner's
[7:50] church and the youth there of heaven so
[7:52] we changed it over to not conflict with
[7:54] it to where if you could you know if you
[7:56] were going that's fine and then we'd
[7:58] have ours to our time so it'll be on the
[8:02] 18th so remember that just look at the
[8:05] thing as you going down and don't forget
[8:07] it okay any other
[8:09] announcements I generally
[8:11] forget something okay all right so let's
[8:15] pray Heavenly Father we thank you for
[8:17] your love and your grace Lord un to us
[8:19] we thank you for the fact that you saved
[8:22] us yes Lord what would it be if we
[8:25] didn't have you in an hour and a time
[8:28] when there's nothing certain yes nothing
[8:32] Everlasting nothing to be worth anything
[8:35] even if we own the whole world it's
[8:36] going down the drain that's right and
[8:39] Lord but to just have one little speck
[8:41] of eternal life in our soul that's right
[8:43] and to be the children of almighty God
[8:45] that's right we love you father and we
[8:47] thank you we ask you to just bless us
[8:49] now with your presence as we read your
[8:52] word you come and speak to our hearts
[8:54] give us what you'd have for us to hear
[8:56] this day Lord and teach us to wait upon
[8:59] you
[9:00] in Jesus name
[9:05] amen Matthew 5 we're just start about
[9:07] verse
[9:11] 43 you have heard it hath been said Thou
[9:14] shalt love thy
[9:16] neighbor and hate thine enemy but I say
[9:19] unto you love your enemies bless them
[9:21] that curse you do good to them that hate
[9:23] you and pray for them which despitefully
[9:25] use you and persecute you that you may
[9:29] be the children of your father which is
[9:31] in heaven that's right for he maketh his
[9:33] son to rise on the evil and on the good
[9:35] and on and sendeth rain on the just and
[9:37] the
[9:38] unjust for if you love them which love
[9:41] you what reward have you do not even the
[9:44] publicans the same and if you salute
[9:46] your brethren only what do you more than
[9:49] others do not even the publicans so be
[9:53] ye therefore perfect even as your father
[9:55] which is in heaven is perfect amen so
[9:59] now let's go over
[10:03] to Exodus 12 and we'll begin verse
[10:08] 12 for I will pass through the land of
[10:10] Egypt this night and will Smite all the
[10:12] firstborn in the land of Egypt both man
[10:15] and Beast and against all the gods of
[10:18] Egypt I will execute judgment I am the
[10:21] Lord and the blood shall be to you for a
[10:24] token upon the houses where you are ye
[10:27] are and when I see the the blood I will
[10:30] pass over you and the plague shall not
[10:31] be upon you to destroy you when I smite
[10:35] the land of Egypt you may be seated the
[10:38] Lord add his Blessing to the reading of
[10:40] the word
[10:43] now the Lord will end this coming Sunday
[10:46] we'll try to
[10:49] um bring this to a conclusion of of U
[10:53] maybe having questions and answers
[10:55] comments Etc we've been saying that now
[10:57] me to get another message for
[10:59] but that's all right but I'm sure it
[11:01] will come eventually we'll get to that
[11:04] anyway but you know I'm just wanting to
[11:07] try to get us to understand and then
[11:10] that way if you have any questions or
[11:12] whatever write it down you know and and
[11:15] give it to me and I love to read them
[11:17] Sister Barbara wrote me a about a three
[11:19] or four page uh comment about the the
[11:22] message basically this last weekend and
[11:26] I really enjoyed reading it you know and
[11:28] I I'd like to hear your comments and
[11:30] things because I want to know whether or
[11:32] not it's dwelling within each one of us
[11:34] and coming to the place of understanding
[11:37] right amen and I've been thinking a lot
[11:39] this week on one thing you know what
[11:42] what what a wonderful
[11:46] opportunity for you and I that we can be
[11:49] the children of God Amen that's right
[11:51] you think about that I mean that's just
[11:55] you know that's very simple I know but
[11:58] that's just been a thought on my my
[11:59] heart all this week right to just think
[12:02] about amen I didn't get to know my
[12:04] father because he passed away before
[12:07] became old enough to remember much about
[12:09] him and everything but I guess that's
[12:12] what makes the difference to think about
[12:14] you know and and realized and to know
[12:16] that I have a heavenly father that's
[12:19] right that I can talk to see even that
[12:21] if my Earthly father would have been
[12:23] here or would even be here now which
[12:25] would be hard to be in the age but still
[12:28] you know if IID have got to have known
[12:30] him and everything still I couldn't you
[12:32] know I I could have talked with him on
[12:35] rare occasions or fellowship with him a
[12:37] little but you know our father we all we
[12:39] got to do is just we don't even have to
[12:43] uh pray out loud we don't have to
[12:45] communicate and holl up into the heavens
[12:48] and and everything and just but just to
[12:51] stop and just think a little
[12:54] amen and just think that he chose us
[12:57] amen
[12:59] out of all of the people of the world
[13:02] Amen there's some good people in this
[13:04] world I mean there are good people out
[13:06] there but to think that he chose us amen
[13:10] he chose us not only to
[13:12] salvation but he chose us to reveal
[13:15] himself to us
[13:18] amen reveal himself to us right the
[13:23] Eternal God would think enough of you
[13:25] and
[13:26] I amen the cond sin down and speak to us
[13:32] amen and reveal himself to us it's just
[13:36] you know you can't hardly even think
[13:38] about it without just breaking down
[13:40] crying and and things you know and like
[13:43] I think it was brother Rand said it
[13:45] makes you feel like you you could just
[13:47] it's been said you know that you could
[13:48] crawl under a concrete block with a 10
[13:50] gon hat on your head and never even turn
[13:53] the block over cuz it just makes you so
[13:55] little to think about those things
[13:57] that's right but that's you know that's
[13:59] just him now let's get into the point
[14:01] tonight because I told you Sunday I told
[14:04] you up front what we're going to do and
[14:07] that's what we'll try to do
[14:09] tonight and you know and I told you like
[14:12] up front that I was when it says you
[14:14] know that uh his seed remaineth in him
[14:16] and he cannot sin well I hope you was
[14:20] listening and and understanding what I
[14:22] was trying to bring that it's the seed
[14:25] of God that cannot s right you and I
[14:28] were born in sin sh in iniquity no
[14:31] matter what good we think we are or
[14:33] whatever we're we're we're just worth
[14:35] nothing right and and but yet that seed
[14:38] remaineth in
[14:39] us and we cannot sin so there is a
[14:43] man that see we've been preaching about
[14:46] for all this time you know there is a
[14:48] man that God will not impute sin right
[14:51] right well see how could he impute sin
[14:53] to himself
[14:55] right I I hope you listening there
[14:58] Sunday go back and listen to it how
[15:00] could he impute sin to himself how could
[15:03] how could the baptism of the Holy
[15:06] Ghost sin right how can God sin how can
[15:10] can there be anything credited to him
[15:13] right well I
[15:16] thought that we believe that it was the
[15:18] father dwelling in
[15:20] us you know and if he's dwelling in us
[15:24] then how could there ever be anything
[15:26] imputed to that right
[15:30] it won't it won't work right we may make
[15:33] human mistakes yes and all like that we
[15:37] even may as a prophet would say we may
[15:39] even willfully and I know how he covers
[15:41] that on both stages of he said if we
[15:44] send willfully I receive the knowledge
[15:45] of the truth are in Hebrews there's no
[15:47] more sacrifice I know too that he'll say
[15:50] we would even willfully do wrong right
[15:52] come we no better to do it and then
[15:54] we'll go do it and know but immediately
[15:56] we repent amen yes Lord and get rid of
[15:59] that we don't you know it don't just
[16:01] Linger on and on we get rid of it and
[16:03] ask our father to forgive us but if the
[16:06] father's dwelling in Us by the new
[16:09] birth you
[16:11] know if he's in there by the new birth
[16:14] amen how can he that's inside of me do
[16:18] anything wrong that's right amen well
[16:20] then are you going to try to split up
[16:21] the soul of the individual because
[16:24] that's where we believe the new birth is
[16:26] at right right are you going to try to
[16:28] split that up up that somewhere in that
[16:30] soul is you and somewhere there's God
[16:32] and you know and all this that and the
[16:34] other I I you you're not getting them
[16:37] what I tried to preach right I I tried
[16:40] my best to bring it out to us that that
[16:43] we supposed to be dead amen right Samuel
[16:46] Dale was supposed to be dead right
[16:49] William Brenham was he said died 30
[16:51] something years ago right we're supposed
[16:53] to be dead and he's supposed to be alive
[16:56] that's right all right now if that's
[16:57] that way then and we believe it then
[17:00] there's no way inwardly a man can sin
[17:03] right all right so then we'll just take
[17:05] the point right up the front tonight see
[17:07] cuz that's what I tried to make the
[17:08] point then to get you to see that the
[17:12] seed of God is the alive word amen now a
[17:15] seed without life is no good right
[17:18] neither is the word of God a natural
[17:21] seed without life is is not worth
[17:23] anything right sure make some good
[17:25] cornbread or something out of it but it
[17:27] won't reproduce itself amen right but
[17:30] see then the seed of God being the alive
[17:32] word and the prophet of God I gave it to
[17:34] you there last week on paragraph 273 is
[17:37] not on the notes or nothing God's power
[17:40] to transform he actually says that the
[17:43] seed of God he ask the question he said
[17:45] how many in here has the seed of God the
[17:48] baptism of the Holy Ghost right amen and
[17:51] I said praise the Lord when I read that
[17:53] cuz that's what it is right see and that
[17:56] way you're not dealing with any kind of
[17:57] a natural seed or genetics or anything
[18:01] you're dealing with the one seed which
[18:03] is Christ right amen and that seed must
[18:06] be made alive that word is God's
[18:09] seed right but that word without the
[18:13] life it won't produce anything but if
[18:16] it's made alive so then the alive word
[18:19] is what we we have see the baptism of
[18:21] the Holy
[18:23] Ghost so now we should be able to see
[18:27] that and understand MH that there's no
[18:30] way that that Soul can
[18:32] sin so it's not that God don't impute
[18:35] sin to it it's the fact that it can't
[18:37] sin right that's what I hope you got the
[18:40] scripture putting it together with with
[18:42] David and them saying you know blessed
[18:44] is the man to whom God would not impute
[18:46] sin and then bring it over to you know
[18:48] and Paul bringing that across and then
[18:51] bringing it over to to where we were
[18:54] dealing with and John saying that his
[18:56] seed remaineth in and he cannot sin am
[18:59] right amen all right putting on all
[19:01] together
[19:02] then there's just no way that that Soul
[19:05] can sin right so it's not that God don't
[19:09] impute as you try to be some fancy
[19:11] something or some great something that
[19:14] God won't impute right no no CU we went
[19:17] through it and covered it right God did
[19:19] impute to David yep the things he had
[19:23] done right now it didn't stop him from
[19:26] receiving eternal life later right
[19:28] because he will in the resurrection or
[19:30] whatever whatever you're going to deal
[19:31] with the Old Testament people they did
[19:33] not get eternal life back there right
[19:35] all right but yet that was imputed
[19:38] because he lost a child and lost a
[19:40] throne and all kind of things right
[19:43] right so then by by doing that and as a
[19:46] covered Paul even said I Die daily amen
[19:50] all right see then those two men
[19:53] couldn't have been saying out of one
[19:54] side of their mouth that I do things
[19:57] wrong and and then out of the other side
[19:59] of the mouth saying you know blessed is
[20:02] the man to whom God will not impute
[20:04] right because if you think you're so
[20:07] great that God won't impute well
[20:10] then God didn't die for you right that's
[20:14] as simple as I can make it he didn't die
[20:17] for for me or you if we think we're so
[20:20] great and don't need it that would have
[20:22] been messing all up God's plan but now
[20:26] in covering tonight he's taking it from
[20:29] the Outlook of what we tried to bring
[20:31] out there that the soul is born
[20:36] again and it cannot
[20:39] sin it's perfectly totally
[20:41] sinless all right so when Jesus said be
[20:45] therefore perfect even as your father in
[20:47] Heaven is
[20:49] perfect you've got the only way to be as
[20:51] perfect as their father is perfect is to
[20:53] have a life of the father right that
[20:56] should be sensible you know you need a
[20:59] great Revelation to just read that or
[21:02] think about it that he's G us his own
[21:04] life made us Eternal he made us Eternal
[21:07] he made us Perfect Right amen right but
[21:10] now see we're still left with this part
[21:13] out here and I know that I I I I've
[21:16] tried to emphasize to you over the years
[21:21] that a true Born Again believer so that
[21:24] Soul can't sin right but this body and
[21:26] spirit is still in the domain of sa
[21:29] right it's still subject to things of
[21:32] Life the world and and whatever see and
[21:37] and and being it it's getting worse now
[21:40] because Satan knows that he's just got a
[21:43] little season left because if he don't
[21:46] need if he don't know that he already
[21:48] listen to CNN you
[21:50] know you know what I'm
[21:53] saying cuz everybody saying this
[21:56] horrible things you know and and all
[21:59] like that so then he ought to get down
[22:01] to to watching some of his own TV maybe
[22:04] himself right but
[22:08] now see that that spirit and that body
[22:13] is is still in this domain you say well
[22:17] we're we're just a a unit of Body Spirit
[22:19] and soul
[22:22] okay but now if you make the soul
[22:25] sin and you have it as a unit
[22:28] and saying that your body Spirit Soul
[22:30] sin then look what You' have you'd have
[22:33] God s it right there's no way to reach
[22:35] Perfection n way right I mean no way
[22:38] period BL I'm sorry but there's no way
[22:41] that you could ever find perfection in
[22:43] anything don't you have God sending
[22:46] right H but you say well we're just we
[22:50] we're just all a product no by the new
[22:53] birth we're not a product of sin amen
[22:56] right we're product of God Amen
[22:59] he was the beginning of the creation
[23:00] we're the rest of that creation are you
[23:02] going to uh impute to him wrong no no we
[23:08] don't want to do that but see we want to
[23:10] get it in the right place that still as
[23:13] a human in our our Realms of where we're
[23:16] at that we we have problems with our
[23:19] body and our spirit and that's what I
[23:21] want to deal with
[23:23] tonight because to me David when he said
[23:26] blessed is to whom God will not impute
[23:30] sin follow me the words I'm saying
[23:34] now he cannot be talking of an
[23:38] eternal person right because an eternal
[23:42] person won sin right all right so he's
[23:46] talking more of the rest of this being
[23:49] that you look at because he is saying
[23:52] blessed is the man to whom God will not
[23:54] impute sin showing that that man does
[23:57] sin right
[23:59] right are you listening amen words why
[24:03] would he say it that way right blessed
[24:05] is the man to whom God will not impute
[24:07] sin well that means that that
[24:11] person
[24:13] sins well God won't impute it I mean is
[24:17] any problem with that that's right I
[24:20] mean that's to me that's
[24:22] simple because he wouldn't be talking
[24:24] about Sin if there wasn't sin involved
[24:26] right right but see that then that way
[24:29] we're looking at the body and the spirit
[24:32] still in Satan's
[24:34] domain and there has to be a Redemption
[24:36] of this right all right so then in the
[24:43] meantime in the meantime of waiting for
[24:46] the
[24:47] Redemption then we have to have a
[24:51] covering that's right cuz see that's
[24:54] what the blood of the bulls and goats
[24:56] done right
[24:58] it covered
[25:01] demand in back DIY you
[25:04] know it was a token that's right
[25:08] okay the blood was a
[25:10] token all right now as it did then it
[25:13] covered them that when they done certain
[25:17] things wrong they go up and offer the
[25:18] offer that would cover that we we've
[25:20] been through this but the once a
[25:23] year see for the whole thing of Israel
[25:28] yeah it would go in and make an
[25:29] atonement or a covering that's the title
[25:32] of the message more and just a
[25:35] covering all right and that blood of
[25:37] bulls and goats would cover that
[25:41] people until God would not destroy him
[25:46] right all right so it was wonderful and
[25:50] the prophet of God said now if under the
[25:53] blood of bulls and goats right God did
[25:56] not you know
[25:58] kill those people for the sin theyve
[26:00] done wrong he said what about under the
[26:04] blood of Jesus Christ that's right all
[26:07] right see then that would come down to
[26:10] where that it would bring us to a
[26:12] Greater Hope and understanding of who we
[26:14] are right and what's going
[26:17] on CU see this out here I keep saying it
[26:20] this
[26:21] body is motivated by a spirit that's
[26:24] within him
[26:26] amen all right y and and then as doing
[26:29] that then it can yield to that old
[26:34] desires right and see that that's why
[26:36] that I I I've tried to always be playing
[26:38] with you but honest people are say oh
[26:41] when I got born again everything went
[26:44] out
[26:47] well I pray to God that's true right I I
[26:51] just don't believe it right amen because
[26:54] I I I didn't experience it that way now
[26:57] the old sin of My Life The Wait the
[27:00] things that I repented of sure it went
[27:02] away from me sure I changed my nature
[27:05] way I begin to do different and and act
[27:07] different okay right we're we're on
[27:10] there but still it never took away all
[27:13] of the problem
[27:15] right all right and in one way it put me
[27:20] into a greater condition
[27:22] because it brought within this unit that
[27:26] we talk about it brought a Waring
[27:29] between the two as Paul was explaining
[27:33] right and one yielding to the flesh the
[27:36] other yielding to the spirit of God
[27:38] that's within him and it puts us in a
[27:40] Warfare amen and and see we didn't even
[27:43] have a knowledge of sin until the law
[27:46] came to condemn us and things so when
[27:49] the new birth
[27:50] came a lot of the things we used to
[27:52] think wasn't
[27:54] wrong right yeah we begin to be more
[27:57] conscious about what we were doing right
[28:01] right they used to think well they going
[28:03] to lose my temper a little bit well I
[28:04] can't help it that's just old day or you
[28:07] know as part of my family we're all like
[28:09] this well then we come to realize hey
[28:12] that's not no justification anymore
[28:14] that's right right it's not what Mom and
[28:16] Daddy do it's it's us all right now see
[28:20] what I'm hoping this will try to
[28:22] explain maybe something to you to me too
[28:30] is anybody in here that would say you
[28:31] don't ever have any wrong
[28:35] thoughts that's got hands yet but
[28:40] right well is any of you would say you
[28:43] never had any wrong
[28:51] desires all right don't you wonder about
[28:54] that
[28:58] don't you wonder about
[29:01] that you ever had a bad
[29:05] dream right I mean maybe vul
[29:09] dreams you know right maybe
[29:14] uh wanting not maybe to lust in your
[29:18] body that way but maybe being see
[29:20] yourself mad at
[29:22] somebody or see yourself in your dreams
[29:25] that you know I I I used to I'd always
[29:28] do it and I never could figure that one
[29:29] out but maybe one of these days I'll ask
[29:31] the Lord about it but I'd always try to
[29:33] whip weight in my dream within my hand
[29:36] would just
[29:39] stop I always wonder what happened if I
[29:41] could went on through with it but you
[29:43] know but you never had this wrong
[29:48] dreams that you you know that it's not
[29:50] part of your really your true makeup
[29:54] right oh yeah you know it's not part of
[29:56] your natural true make up
[29:59] amen and you you never wondered about
[30:03] why that would be that
[30:06] way
[30:08] right right and and you never thought
[30:10] about it say basically dreams or
[30:12] something uh dealing with in toward the
[30:15] subconscious part of the
[30:17] human as to wondering if and then
[30:21] brother Ram would say the soul is the
[30:23] subconscious right yeah and then you
[30:27] wait a minute now the soul is the
[30:28] subconscious and then the dream is in a
[30:31] subconscious and here I am having wrong
[30:34] dreams does it mean I'm
[30:38] lost you don't you don't never think
[30:40] that way
[30:44] right well I'm just honest right
[30:49] amen I mean right you may say well I
[30:53] since I got born again I ain't never had
[30:55] a negative thought about whether I saved
[30:57] or not well I pray and hope that that's
[31:00] right I do I just don't believe it but I
[31:03] pray I hope that's that's right okay oh
[31:06] my you never question your
[31:10] salvation amen you've never the devil
[31:13] never has come to you and told you you
[31:15] was
[31:16] lost
[31:20] M
[31:22] well see then this is I'm trying to talk
[31:26] about cuz I've tried to explain it for
[31:27] 40
[31:29] years this is not a new message to me
[31:32] trying to preach to you and you that
[31:34] have been around know for sure that's
[31:35] true and I've always tried to preach to
[31:37] show you a condition or existence that
[31:40] the new birth with inside of you is
[31:42] perfectly totally sinless
[31:45] amen but the body and spirit of man is
[31:48] in a
[31:49] turmoil and Satan is attacking that
[31:53] amen and and and you know I mean I've
[31:56] got up and pray to God why would I dream
[31:59] y a dream like that a
[32:03] horrible dream you
[32:05] know why would I have wrong desires
[32:09] right you said well now wait a minute
[32:11] now maybe my desires is a little
[32:13] different your desires but my when I'm
[32:15] talking about desires doesn't always
[32:17] mean that you're running around you know
[32:19] so lustful that you can't stand it I'm
[32:21] not I'm always just beening plain all
[32:24] right right it's just any little
[32:29] thing you know I remember I used to I
[32:33] finally told Brother Mo you know that
[32:35] we'd be going down the highway and he'd
[32:38] be talking to me about the lord the
[32:40] devil and I'd be driving he said run off
[32:43] the road on his side and let hit a
[32:45] tree you Ain never thought like
[32:48] that you ain't never had the devil to
[32:50] tempt you in the thing right
[32:53] amen well pray for me okay
[32:58] because and I finally out life and told
[33:00] him one day I said brother M Devil's
[33:02] been trying to get me to kill you ever
[33:03] since me and you got together he just Li
[33:08] but but you see to understand what I'm
[33:11] talking about you can understand the
[33:13] human being
[33:15] right you can understand that that we
[33:18] are the most wonderful product amen
[33:21] that's right now we're not like Jesus
[33:24] Jesus didn't have these things but still
[33:26] now
[33:28] even Jesus was tempted right yes sir
[33:32] amen you agree and brother R said even
[33:35] by women sure so now you do what you
[33:38] want to about it I'm sure not in this
[33:41] garbage can of saying that that Jesus
[33:44] done wrong right temptation is not wrong
[33:47] it's when you yield a Temptation amen
[33:49] not wrong to be tempted you know it's
[33:52] wrong to yield to the Temptation
[33:54] amen but you see then that way we can
[33:57] see our eles in what we really
[34:00] are and you see that really then this is
[34:03] what David and and Paul was talking
[34:06] about that if there's any way that God
[34:10] could make it for us then there's a
[34:15] covering there
[34:17] right that covers
[34:21] Us that even when we do wrong amen that
[34:24] it covers Us yes Lord yeah if under the
[34:27] blood of bulls and goats that could
[34:29] cover how much more would it be under
[34:32] the blood of Jesus Christ amen that's
[34:34] right to cover us see th to me is what
[34:37] David and Paul is talking about right
[34:39] bless is the man to whom God will not
[34:41] impute sin right yes sir though we got
[34:43] to explaining the other day now
[34:45] everybody says sin sin sin you know and
[34:48] I know that probably didn't go over with
[34:50] maybe was some of you that didn't go
[34:52] over a probably sure out on the internet
[34:54] that's all right I just preach what I
[34:55] believe you there's one thing about it
[34:57] you come and ask me I'll tell you what I
[34:59] believe I'm not these kind of preachers
[35:01] that run around and around and around
[35:02] and then you know just let you believe
[35:04] what you want to about what I believe
[35:06] I'm going to tell you that's right and
[35:08] that way then I I don't have to worry
[35:10] about it because I can be honest but see
[35:13] I believe
[35:14] David was looking at at at a
[35:20] person that would stand on the
[35:23] Earth by the new birth
[35:28] and say not that we don't sin right cuz
[35:32] we just covered it Sunday John said if
[35:34] you say you don't sin you're a liar
[35:36] right amen right that's you know brother
[35:41] R said we sin every
[35:42] day see you say well brother no no don't
[35:45] try to prop it up see and say well it's
[35:48] not talking about he said he s there so
[35:50] I think he was born get believer right
[35:53] amen amen don't try to make it somebody
[35:55] in justification or sanctification
[35:58] yeah and try to prop up something with
[36:00] it I I I believe he was there all right
[36:04] but see David and them was looking down
[36:06] then and David wasn't necessarily
[36:09] looking at
[36:13] himself because he knew that sin was
[36:16] imputed unto him right but he knew there
[36:19] was a protective
[36:23] covering all right and you remember we
[36:26] preach your while what that was was God
[36:29] looking at the atonement or was he
[36:31] looking at his word
[36:33] right which is the greatest part was the
[36:37] atonement the animal the sacrifice
[36:39] greater than the word that he
[36:43] said so when David come to the place he
[36:46] that he condemned his own life and said
[36:49] bring the man you're not killing Nathan
[36:51] said Thou Art the man but immediately
[36:53] see the prophet of God his words he said
[36:56] but David you want
[37:00] die that the child ad die said you won't
[37:03] die right why because it was a
[37:06] protective point of the
[37:08] word of the Prophet amen so which one do
[37:11] you want you want the atoma you want a
[37:13] natural animal or do you want God's word
[37:15] amen that's right I'll take his word
[37:18] because his word then I can I can abide
[37:20] by that's right all right see all of
[37:23] this is tied together down through many
[37:25] many messages and and I know somebody
[37:27] hear hear me one time you don't know
[37:29] what I'm talking about well I'm sorry uh
[37:32] I don't have enough time tonight to repr
[37:33] preach all that I preached for
[37:35] years but I've been preaching this for
[37:37] 40
[37:39] years not that we're such a goody goody
[37:42] people that God don't impute to us right
[37:44] no oh and that's his wonderful little
[37:47] children now you're making him a do to
[37:50] your granddaddy that's
[37:52] right that's right you making him just a
[37:54] word that well it's okay for my my kids
[37:58] I've been around people that believe
[38:01] that but I don't believe it right amen
[38:05] my wife my children my grandchildren my
[38:10] daughter-in-laws my son-in-law my great
[38:13] grandkids they all got to have the
[38:15] baptism of the Holy Ghost that's
[38:17] right all right that's right they all
[38:20] got to have the new birth they ain't
[38:21] going to heaven just because Pap was
[38:23] going
[38:24] right now we've claimed them and God
[38:27] will bring them all right that's another
[38:30] part of the course right but I still
[38:32] don't automatically give them eternal
[38:34] life that's
[38:37] right but you see then David was looking
[38:41] and seeing himself but in Prophecy he
[38:44] was speaking of the new birth that would
[38:46] come
[38:49] right in other words you can say David
[38:52] by the spirit was saying or by the Holy
[38:55] Spirit was
[38:56] saying blessed is the man to whom God
[38:58] will not impute
[39:00] sin and he knew that even though it was
[39:03] imputed unto
[39:05] him that that covering of his
[39:09] day God would not destroy him
[39:14] right now how much more would be the
[39:16] blood of Jesus Christ
[39:18] amen to where we can look in this day
[39:21] where we're at and down here and believe
[39:24] and
[39:24] see that ever born again believer
[39:28] brother R I gave it to you remember in
[39:30] in the seal book I know first seal he
[39:32] said ever born he say anybody perfect he
[39:34] said ever born again believer is
[39:38] perfectly totally sinless Amen in the
[39:41] sight of God right all right so then y
[39:47] solve the case right right amen but then
[39:51] our body and our spirit is keeping us
[39:53] from is that's what is that the point of
[39:55] keeping us from adoption that's right
[39:58] cuz it's not the adoption and the things
[40:00] based upon our our lives and our
[40:02] yielding ourselves to God that's
[40:05] right and then that way you can be a
[40:07] child of God but not be adopted right
[40:11] right because of the nature and the ways
[40:13] that we are right surely we wouldn't
[40:16] have any concept or thought within our
[40:19] mind that uh we're a special kind of
[40:25] people we are because because what God
[40:28] has made us right amen that's right
[40:30] that's what's wonderful amen he has
[40:33] given us eternal
[40:35] life by giving us the his own
[40:38] life then he could set us free yes amen
[40:42] he could lose us from sin right all
[40:47] right but then there's got to be a
[40:48] covering just like the prophet would say
[40:50] he said you're not saved by the
[40:53] blood you remember that that's right
[40:56] amen he said you're kept saved by
[40:59] it now what does he
[41:02] mean if we're good Baptist and and get
[41:05] it off when we believe and what do we
[41:07] need anything else for
[41:09] yeah see the prophet was Sav the truth
[41:13] of
[41:14] it by the new birth we're perfectly
[41:17] totally sinless in our
[41:19] soul but our body and spirit is in this
[41:21] world and realm that we live in and
[41:23] still subject to these things right and
[41:26] The Temptations things
[41:29] see that's why then looking at it the
[41:33] secret of all of the things is whether
[41:35] or not we believe that the blood keeps
[41:39] us safe right
[41:42] amen now we're not saved by the blood
[41:44] we're saved by the life that's
[41:46] right that is within the blood all
[41:50] right but the blood is a
[41:54] covering right right right
[41:58] so then as long as we can stay under the
[42:03] covering all right now get the natural
[42:07] story
[42:09] Israel that covering was good for one
[42:14] year you agree right now you had animal
[42:18] sacrifices for different things and
[42:20] things that went wrong or or birth of a
[42:22] child or or sickness or something is
[42:24] healed you had all kind of sacrifices
[42:26] right but the main thing I'm trying to
[42:28] get you to look at is the atonement that
[42:29] was
[42:31] made see once a
[42:34] year and it covered Israel for that
[42:40] year but there had to be another one
[42:42] made the next
[42:45] year
[42:48] okay but then when Jesus Christ
[42:54] came to bring it into a condition
[42:58] that was not just the blood of a of an
[43:02] animal it was not even the blood of a
[43:05] man
[43:07] amen it was the blood of God right
[43:11] amen that's the man that we need to look
[43:16] to all right so now my point is what as
[43:20] long as we're under the protective cover
[43:23] of the Covenant yeah that's it
[43:28] then God W to impute
[43:31] sin see that's where we don't listen to
[43:34] brother of randam and pay close
[43:38] attention I was talking with someone
[43:41] yesterday about that and I said just you
[43:43] know we we just don't listen we don't
[43:44] hear what brother ROM
[43:48] said but if he said something we should
[43:52] base our life on it right of course you
[43:54] know what everybody does I base my life
[43:56] on it but
[43:57] you know then he says forsake not to S
[44:00] well he wouldn't let the Lord say that
[44:01] you know yeah but that's it's all
[44:04] right but listen
[44:07] Church to me it the secret is whether or
[44:12] not we can
[44:15] believe that that blood is covering us
[44:21] right all
[44:23] right now on that basis remember one
[44:26] thing I said most people they can they
[44:29] they'll read things but they pass over
[44:32] L you know that brother around said
[44:34] there's not a sinner in the world today
[44:40] no you want te
[44:43] quote he said because the atonement was
[44:47] made and God can't see
[44:52] it right all right
[44:57] you said well look at that old CER we
[44:59] was down my mother-in-law was one Sunday
[45:02] and it was a lot of her family was there
[45:04] you know and I mean it was honest I'm
[45:06] not throwing off home just making a
[45:07] point all right and this man next door
[45:10] was cutting grass you know he was going
[45:13] out through there cutting grass on
[45:14] Sunday and this lady she said he's going
[45:17] to die and go to hell for that said boy
[45:20] he'll regret that one of these days
[45:22] cutting Grist on the Sabbath
[45:27] and I didn't say nothing because I knew
[45:30] the way they believe it all
[45:33] right but you see there is no sinners in
[45:37] the world today right do we look down
[45:40] and see each other and call each other
[45:41] Sinners there if there's any sin why
[45:44] hasn't God Anni annihilated it
[45:47] right cuz sin in the presence of God one
[45:49] Split Second without a covering he would
[45:52] have to annihilate you right right
[45:57] all
[45:58] right see that's why I even covered you
[46:00] know over and over about uh Adam and Eve
[46:03] in the garden who took care of them
[46:06] until God made the atonement with the
[46:08] animals
[46:09] amen it was God's word right amen that's
[46:13] right they said he stood as a l slave
[46:15] before the foundation of the world right
[46:17] amen you know that brother rown I think
[46:20] it's in this he said you know that the
[46:22] way God sees
[46:25] you he said said he sees
[46:28] you exactly like he saw
[46:31] you before the world right when he put
[46:34] you name on the blood yeah right all
[46:38] right
[46:39] now here's what I'm saying and this is
[46:42] going to be hard to follow so listen
[46:45] please and go back and listen to this
[46:46] tape again because I'm just going the
[46:48] best I can
[46:53] go then if there is no sinner
[46:58] because an atonement was made to cover
[47:01] the world with a bumper of
[47:03] blood right right the blood of Jesus
[47:07] Christ the prophet said was like a
[47:09] bumper you remember and we'll get one in
[47:11] a minute you remember he went in one day
[47:13] and he saw this police officer over here
[47:15] and saw this woman over here and the
[47:16] jeuk joint going and all these things
[47:18] well he he wanted to kill him he said
[47:20] God I don't see I wor you could just put
[47:22] a the Lord said come behind the door I'd
[47:24] like to talk to you right he explains it
[47:27] like
[47:29] this he said I saw a
[47:32] vision
[47:33] right what now like the brother was
[47:36] bringing out the other day you know of
[47:39] whether it was fish was cooked and
[47:41] another scripture said it was baked and
[47:44] you yeah see you get all tied up in
[47:47] confusion right brother Brandon on
[47:50] another time he
[47:52] says I saw a vision in my mind
[48:00] y he wouldn't see naturally a vision in
[48:02] what he said I saw a vision in my
[48:06] mind and the Lord showed him all the
[48:08] little things of his life you remember
[48:12] right and said now you want to condemn
[48:15] her well you know what he went over and
[48:18] [Music]
[48:19] repented bless God I ain't repenting for
[48:22] being one of just can't stand sin well
[48:26] he went over to her and repented and you
[48:29] know what she got saved that night some
[48:32] of the others there
[48:33] too because of what he said
[48:37] right but do you understand what I'm
[48:39] getting
[48:41] at he said when I see the blood I'll
[48:43] pass over
[48:47] you I gave you a quote the other day
[48:49] where brother R said he can't inuk sin
[48:51] over the tokens that's right d all right
[48:57] now I'm going to try to explain
[48:58] something that ain't never tried to
[48:59] explain so all right
[49:04] listen you see we are a a
[49:08] unit we are a
[49:10] people we're Body Spirit and
[49:13] soul and you know when God gave you that
[49:16] new
[49:19] birth he's pleased to dwell in you
[49:22] that's right
[49:24] exactly oh no that's Jesus on the river
[49:26] Jord brother R said he's pleased to
[49:27] dwell and he's even pleased to honor
[49:29] your word
[49:32] am he pleased to
[49:35] dwell
[49:37] okay and then he says I I won't impute
[49:41] sin the prophet God of God
[49:44] said he can't see
[49:48] us he said you look through red it red
[49:52] yep and said you see
[49:55] what he said he can't see us because of
[49:58] the bumper blood right said but he hears
[50:01] our voice amen that's right you know
[50:04] like show you want it maybe in here my
[50:06] brother around was talking about healing
[50:09] he said he hears my voice through the
[50:12] blood and he said I'm asking for
[50:16] healing what about that asking for
[50:19] healing right as it being compared to
[50:22] the blood of Jesus Christ
[50:26] well you know I thought we believe the
[50:30] Bible that says by his
[50:34] stripes we are healed right well the
[50:37] prophet was right wasn't he mhm right he
[50:40] said through the
[50:43] blood the atonement I'm
[50:46] asking for
[50:48] healing well he was just asking him to
[50:50] fulfill the scripture cuz the blood run
[50:52] out when they beat him right so the
[50:53] blood run out for our healing all right
[50:57] that's right so now listen
[51:01] then see then by the soul that soul is
[51:04] perfect
[51:07] amen but because of the atonement that
[51:10] we exist
[51:16] under all right wake up cuz you
[51:21] don't you know then it's
[51:24] possible if we can believe God's
[51:28] word until our body and
[51:32] spirit won't be controlling us right
[51:41] sure oh we may be human yeah we make
[51:44] mistakes
[51:47] yeah but under the
[51:50] blood where can he impute sin
[51:57] now come on because you know what the
[51:59] prophet said is right he said that there
[52:01] is no sinner in the world today he said
[52:03] because it's under the bump of blood
[52:06] think about it
[52:07] amen he said he don't even cond a sinner
[52:10] for
[52:11] sin he said he just condemned us because
[52:13] he is a sinner
[52:16] right we're we're not
[52:18] Sinners we're the children of God
[52:22] Amen now I'm talking about ever born
[52:24] again Believer from
[52:27] Pentecost right so don't just think I'm
[52:29] jumping down to this end to make some
[52:31] great big something out of the end time
[52:33] of some great big Supernatural
[52:35] Revelation this end time boy would
[52:36] nobody got it down to here no there
[52:38] didn't nobody know about it until here
[52:41] right they didn't understand it that's
[52:44] right until
[52:50] now you said well if I believe that
[52:52] Brother D I'd just go out and live like
[52:53] the devil you got you want to quote mhm
[52:56] brother BR said I always do what I want
[52:58] to do
[53:01] amen he said if you go that way you
[53:03] prove you're lost yep that's
[53:07] right but now
[53:09] listen if God is Not imputing sin to The
[53:15] Sinner you know he's not Anni right now
[53:18] one day the blood will be gone right
[53:21] right right that's why the wrath of God
[53:23] will be poured out that's the
[53:24] tribulation uh persecution is not Tri
[53:26] right exactly
[53:28] amen
[53:29] persecution the early church had a great
[53:32] persecution right but they didn't have
[53:34] tribulation tribulation is the wrath of
[53:36] God because the blood's gone right and
[53:39] that's when you'll pray to die and
[53:43] can't y see that will be the tribulation
[53:46] we certainly don't want to be there amen
[53:49] because the blood will be
[53:52] gone but as long as the blood's here you
[53:56] know God don't see
[53:57] us amen thank you
[54:03] Lord now come
[54:05] on how long do I need to preach on the
[54:08] Old Testament
[54:10] people when
[54:12] balum was trying to get God to curse
[54:17] Israel and he even showed God the hinder
[54:20] parts of
[54:21] Israel you know the worst things that
[54:25] could have been trans
[54:27] spiring cuz it's called the hinder
[54:33] parts right but you know what God
[54:38] said he said don't see them don't
[54:41] see amen B would try to curse Israel and
[54:45] God say I don't even see it
[54:49] Amen brother said the reason they didn't
[54:53] that bam couldn't understand because he
[54:55] said he couldn't understand that they
[54:58] Israel had an atonement that's right
[55:01] amen they had a covering that's over
[55:05] them they had the pillar of fire to
[55:09] vindicate who they
[55:14] were and no matter how bad it got he
[55:17] never killed all of them that's
[55:21] right now do I need to go back and
[55:23] preach over it again where that that
[55:24] Moses told Aaron said Aaron
[55:28] your sensor go among the people and stop
[55:32] it God will
[55:35] hear Moses even said Lord you're going
[55:38] to block them out block me out said I'll
[55:40] go up pre-venture I'll make an atonement
[55:42] by his own words right I preached on
[55:44] these things you ought to be
[55:48] listening I rather have the word of God
[55:50] than an atonement I'd rather have the
[55:52] word of God to hold it into my listen
[55:55] I'd rather have the word of God to hold
[55:56] it into my hands and be able to read off
[55:59] the pages than to have my hands covered
[56:01] by the blood of Jesus Christ amen amen
[56:04] amen that's right oh wouldn't we honor
[56:08] that blood if we had
[56:12] it but what about honoring God's word to
[56:15] believe it
[56:17] right right cuz this is what he
[56:20] said this is what's going to set me free
[56:23] is his
[56:24] word brother said Don't listen to
[56:28] man he said listen to God
[56:34] right he say you're free you're loosed
[56:37] by the
[56:39] blood he said don't listen to man you
[56:41] know what he's saying about don't listen
[56:42] to man cuz man's always going to be
[56:44] trying to pull you back under it or
[56:47] either run off the other end of it to
[56:49] talk tell about how great you are
[56:51] whatever you are where it don't matter
[56:53] what you do
[56:54] yeah I a said a word
[56:58] about I'm just saying and I preach to
[57:02] you that we sin a sin as a Christian we
[57:05] reap a tough full that's right we have
[57:08] to repent not we're going to have to
[57:10] answer someday right
[57:14] right when you just got to sin nothing
[57:17] was imputed it's not imputed because of
[57:20] his imputed now you got to kill us
[57:24] y yep you better be right when the
[57:27] blood's
[57:28] gone I like what the old black man said
[57:30] I just don't want no trouble down at the
[57:32] river right amen I want it all done
[57:36] here are you following me
[57:39] right if the blood covering was enough
[57:42] in the Old Testament to keep the wrath
[57:44] of God off of the children of Israel and
[57:47] to atone for their sins what about the
[57:50] blood of Jesus Christ that was offered
[57:52] the Bible said once for all amen that's
[57:55] right and that he's even protected no
[57:57] matter who it is right now right amen
[58:00] the worst person you could think of in
[58:02] the
[58:03] world
[58:05] yep right Y is covered by the blood
[58:09] right
[58:11] now they don't give them eternal life
[58:13] now it's covered by the blood
[58:17] right and God hears their
[58:21] voice
[58:23] amen see then there is a man
[58:28] by the correct understanding there is a
[58:30] man
[58:31] here someone with the baptism of the
[58:33] Holy Ghost on the inside of
[58:36] them and a covering for the things even
[58:39] that they
[58:43] do but then what would we go do with all
[58:46] of that
[58:47] involved you never heard R around talk
[58:50] about he said if I go overseas and said
[58:53] if I go do something some woman comes
[58:54] along something happens he said
[58:56] said I come back and tell my wife said
[58:59] honey I'm sorry he said I believe she'd
[59:02] forgive
[59:04] me but he said how could I do that
[59:09] knowing she would forgive
[59:14] me you say Well it don't make no
[59:16] difference in Brother D you preaching
[59:17] don't make no difference what I do I'm
[59:20] say I didn't say that right where' you
[59:23] get the idea
[59:27] you got to be born again to be saved
[59:29] amen
[59:32] right now the only person that God then
[59:35] not going to impute
[59:37] sin is that person that is born again
[59:40] right that's
[59:43] right all right y cuz others will be
[59:48] imputed someday
[59:50] right but to watch their own judgment
[59:52] they'll have to give an account of the
[59:53] Deeds right
[59:58] I just want to make sure I'm right here
[59:59] don't
[1:00:01] you the Lord forgive
[1:00:04] me we want to be so conscious of that
[1:00:09] right I said Lord forgive
[1:00:13] me well because he's our father
[1:00:19] amen he doesn't see
[1:00:22] us Lord we're covered by the blood of
[1:00:25] Jesus Christ the bumper
[1:00:30] blood he only hears their
[1:00:35] voice saying father forgive
[1:00:38] me you know that brother around said
[1:00:40] when you go out and listen you want this
[1:00:42] quote he said you go out and do
[1:00:43] something wrong he said and he said it
[1:00:45] comes over you and said you immediately
[1:00:48] you know you you feel sorry for what you
[1:00:51] he said it's already been taken care
[1:00:54] of Amen thank you L now that's his
[1:00:57] word he said it's already been taken
[1:01:00] care
[1:01:01] of why because God knew your repentant
[1:01:04] heart would be
[1:01:06] there but what about how he saw us
[1:01:08] before the
[1:01:14] world what about
[1:01:16] that that the way he sees us now is the
[1:01:19] way he saw us before the world let's see
[1:01:21] if I can find that one
[1:01:29] be witness Rec if I can find
[1:01:33] it yeah number four Brother
[1:01:39] Anderson paragraph 50 of on the wings of
[1:01:42] a snow white dove 1965 11:28 look what
[1:01:46] he
[1:01:47] said and that's the way with a real
[1:01:50] Christian did you know a real Christian
[1:01:51] doesn't have even any sin at all imputed
[1:01:55] to him David said blessed is the man to
[1:01:57] whom God will not impute sin too when
[1:01:59] you're washed in the blood of the Lamb
[1:02:01] not by make belief but really the the
[1:02:04] blood of the Lamb God does not impute to
[1:02:07] you anything that's done right listen
[1:02:10] why because you're under the blood and
[1:02:14] he doesn't see it
[1:02:16] right there's a blood
[1:02:19] sacrifice the only thing he can see you
[1:02:23] in is the way he saw you before for the
[1:02:26] foundation of the world when he put your
[1:02:28] name in the Lamb's Book of Life that's
[1:02:31] all he can look at because you are
[1:02:34] redeemed from everything that was ever
[1:02:36] done you're washed in the blood of the
[1:02:38] Lamb therefore there's no G in you
[1:02:41] there's no unclean Habit in you because
[1:02:44] that blood of the Lamb has did this and
[1:02:47] God cannot impute sin to you after
[1:02:49] you've got a sin offering laying they
[1:02:53] waiting for you well you said say that
[1:02:56] gives you say that gives me plenty of
[1:02:59] room then brother brandom I can do what
[1:03:01] I want to do want to I always
[1:03:06] do
[1:03:08] always but when a man can really see
[1:03:11] what Jesus done for him and turn around
[1:03:14] and do something wrong contrary to him
[1:03:17] it shows he never received
[1:03:20] Christ and that would be the essence of
[1:03:23] the whole message that I've tried to
[1:03:25] bring
[1:03:27] how did he see you before the world
[1:03:29] right well now brother Dale you preached
[1:03:31] to us and all that we wouldn't back
[1:03:32] Earth people I
[1:03:36] great all right well there's only the
[1:03:39] eternal life I agree with
[1:03:41] you but don't you think before the
[1:03:45] world that God saw
[1:03:48] absolutely this whole unit that I am
[1:03:51] right
[1:03:52] amen yep huh
[1:03:59] but he saw this unit and how repented it
[1:04:01] would be of what it's
[1:04:07] done did you just see a spook or
[1:04:10] floating around or walk before the
[1:04:12] world we wouldn't back to our people
[1:04:14] come on right but what were we we were
[1:04:17] part of God right right but in part of
[1:04:21] God then he knew he had children yep and
[1:04:23] he knew he was going to put the children
[1:04:24] in flesh right amen
[1:04:28] right do we ever have God looked at you
[1:04:30] before the world's where he's looking at
[1:04:31] you
[1:04:36] now see like I said that order to make
[1:04:39] us to where we could crawl under a
[1:04:40] concrete block with a 10 gon hat on and
[1:04:43] not touch the thing yes it order to
[1:04:46] Humble us yes
[1:04:48] amen instead of bringing us
[1:04:51] up well if I believe that that sounds
[1:04:54] more like greasy Grace
[1:04:57] no you ain't never heard brother Dale
[1:05:00] preach nothing that wound up in the
[1:05:02] greasy Grace that's right amen because I
[1:05:06] don't try to justify you or
[1:05:11] myself I believe in the covering amen I
[1:05:14] believe in atonement right I believe in
[1:05:16] God forgiveness amen that's right
[1:05:19] brother Dale you forgive me that's sure
[1:05:21] I can forgive you all day long that
[1:05:22] don't that don't change
[1:05:24] nothing but if God for issue that's
[1:05:28] right see a lot of people wants a
[1:05:30] preacher to say something you know they
[1:05:32] want him to make some commitment I think
[1:05:34] you're
[1:05:35] saved well I you know I might think you
[1:05:39] are but yeah that ain't got nothing to
[1:05:41] do with you right that's right that's
[1:05:44] between you and God amen
[1:05:48] amen just still with it that
[1:05:51] way but you see the prophet said as he
[1:05:53] saw you before the world right
[1:05:57] well now in his mind could he not see
[1:06:00] where that the seed would land in his
[1:06:02] plan of predestination yep
[1:06:06] absolutely would he not be able to look
[1:06:08] right down to where we are right
[1:06:10] now I righty you remember the quote that
[1:06:12] we used about two or three times there
[1:06:14] brother around 336 of the church age
[1:06:16] book said thereby he could look down
[1:06:17] through time and see himself as being
[1:06:20] the beginning of the creation of God in
[1:06:22] this age right amen
[1:06:27] what about it
[1:06:31] right what about a blood
[1:06:38] atonement they had a natural atonement
[1:06:40] back there yep
[1:06:44] right we have an
[1:06:47] eternal now let's make sure you
[1:06:50] understand what I'm saying and don't get
[1:06:51] on the Covenant some we don't have an
[1:06:53] eternal Covenant right
[1:06:55] there's no such thing an eternal
[1:06:57] Covenant you may believe they are but
[1:06:59] it's not it's a covenant for
[1:07:02] time
[1:07:05] right you may read the scriptures and
[1:07:07] think but it's not the prophet of God
[1:07:09] said we have an Covenant but it's only
[1:07:13] for time he said because when we step
[1:07:15] back over there we don't need the
[1:07:18] Covenant so the Covenant is not Eternal
[1:07:21] right oh I got an eternal Covenant well
[1:07:23] all right that's all right you talking
[1:07:25] about eternal life but right when you
[1:07:27] get down to really
[1:07:29] nitty-gritty the Covenant is not Eternal
[1:07:31] because once you're totally redeemed you
[1:07:33] don't need a covenant anymore right and
[1:07:36] see then that way if the Covenant was
[1:07:37] eternal you'd still need a covenant down
[1:07:39] through time right so we don't need it
[1:07:41] just G if if we can solve the problem
[1:07:44] here and that's what I believe can be
[1:07:47] done
[1:07:48] right I believe somebody can come to
[1:07:50] this to the place here upon this Earth
[1:07:53] to realize by revelation
[1:07:56] that they're perfectly totally sinless
[1:07:59] right in the sight of God right amen
[1:08:03] we'll never be in the sight of
[1:08:06] mankind you want that quote that's right
[1:08:09] never be in the sight of mankind we'll
[1:08:11] never be in the sight of one another
[1:08:14] right oh my right right
[1:08:17] amen we'll never be in the sight of one
[1:08:22] another even though we can say everyone
[1:08:24] here is a born again Christian CHR right
[1:08:26] will never be that inside of one another
[1:08:29] but inside of
[1:08:32] God so then blessed is the
[1:08:37] man now remember the statement I brought
[1:08:39] it over and over and over and over and
[1:08:40] over and over the Born Again Believer
[1:08:42] cannot sin
[1:08:44] right so David is speaking of some of a
[1:08:47] situation and Paul is speaking of a
[1:08:49] situation so then can I state it this
[1:08:52] way and then you take it and apply to
[1:08:55] blessed is the
[1:08:59] man that can believe he's covered
[1:09:04] right amen by the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:09:07] right right amen that's
[1:09:10] it because that man then will not have
[1:09:13] sin imputed right
[1:09:19] amen well that sounds like you're saying
[1:09:21] it's open might sound like a lot of
[1:09:24] things
[1:09:26] but is it
[1:09:29] true blessed is the man that can realize
[1:09:31] he's under the
[1:09:34] [Music]
[1:09:35] covering one of these days I want to
[1:09:37] preach on that because for many years
[1:09:40] I've been looking at
[1:09:43] something why is it that a human
[1:09:48] mortal I'm talking about all over the
[1:09:50] world talking about any
[1:09:53] Christians that a human
[1:09:56] mortal will try to find some kind of a
[1:09:59] god totem fold
[1:10:02] images
[1:10:04] alligators
[1:10:05] um volcanoes right you know some kind of
[1:10:08] a something right that they'll appease
[1:10:11] try to appease that God by even throwing
[1:10:12] their children to the alligator or
[1:10:14] throwing them down a Volcan a volcano
[1:10:18] you know to try to stop
[1:10:20] it why is that that way
[1:10:28] it doesn't matter whether they've heard
[1:10:29] of God or not
[1:10:31] right you know was even a surprise when
[1:10:34] the white man first went to to the
[1:10:36] jungles of
[1:10:38] Africa and uh began to find people back
[1:10:41] there that you know what they
[1:10:44] had they had a mother son
[1:10:49] worship never heard of the Catholic
[1:10:53] church that was a big surprise
[1:10:58] CU you see all of this comes down to a
[1:10:59] spiritual reals right Mankind's always
[1:11:03] tried in every way he can to appease God
[1:11:07] yep whether it be a totem po God or
[1:11:10] whether it be whatever it
[1:11:13] is you see that's silly about a pole is
[1:11:16] is Jesus Christ any different than totem
[1:11:21] pole if you don't have him inside of you
[1:11:23] there's no difference that's right
[1:11:25] that's right if you don't have a new
[1:11:27] birth there's no difference in the totem
[1:11:29] pole and talking about Jesus Christ
[1:11:31] right that's why the people of this
[1:11:33] message have no Fey they say Jesus done
[1:11:35] wrong they say Jesus wouldn't god Till
[1:11:38] here they said all of these things yeah
[1:11:41] well because they have no
[1:11:44] fear because they're looking at him like
[1:11:47] a totem
[1:11:49] pole not another human being let me put
[1:11:51] it that way where you'll understand yeah
[1:11:53] you're looking at him like a looking at
[1:11:55] a quote right in our minute ago brother
[1:11:57] said see there said he was just a man to
[1:11:58] the River Jordan and they'll take them
[1:12:01] and just run hog wildly
[1:12:04] yep I can look at and I say Amen sure
[1:12:10] abely noce the River Jordan was a
[1:12:12] special time right that's when God and
[1:12:15] man united in his fullness according to
[1:12:19] Prophet but I like the way he said it he
[1:12:22] said it was the greatest time that ever
[1:12:24] happened at the river Jordan outside of
[1:12:27] this
[1:12:30] a you remember that
[1:12:33] quote outside of this age that's right
[1:12:36] that was the greatest thing that ever
[1:12:37] happened amen why because God and man's
[1:12:39] going to be one again
[1:12:41] amen when we begin to realize what the
[1:12:45] blood is doing for us to keep us covered
[1:12:47] right you're not saved by the blood
[1:12:49] you're kept saved by it right you're
[1:12:51] covered by
[1:12:52] it until God will not annihilate us
[1:12:58] if you have any any bir amen blessed is
[1:13:02] the man to whom God will not impute
[1:13:04] sin a person that has the new birth
[1:13:08] standing with the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:13:11] stands perfectly totally sinless in the
[1:13:14] presence of God y
[1:13:18] amen what about it come
[1:13:22] on come on Brothers I just left all the
[1:13:25] quotes off other than that one cuz I
[1:13:28] just I really didn't know which way I
[1:13:30] was going to bring all of it out cuz I
[1:13:32] really I'm I'm I'm still to the point
[1:13:34] that I'd like to preach about 4 hours
[1:13:37] now to make sure you understand what I'm
[1:13:40] talking about
[1:13:44] amen we believe in being right and
[1:13:47] living right and doing
[1:13:49] right and repenting when we do wrong
[1:13:53] right and staying on the blood of Jesus
[1:13:56] Christ that's
[1:13:59] right because that's part of the
[1:14:02] plan and we are his children amen how
[1:14:06] wonderful to think about that's right
[1:14:09] and it's not that he loves his children
[1:14:11] so much he don't
[1:14:12] impute he made a way that his children
[1:14:17] by having his nature would understand
[1:14:21] what their
[1:14:22] father meant
[1:14:27] you agree with that statement
[1:14:29] right he knew his children by having his
[1:14:33] nature
[1:14:34] right by the new birth would come to his
[1:14:38] nature in Body Spirit and
[1:14:42] soul because remember he could be
[1:14:44] tempted also
[1:14:46] right but did he sin
[1:14:51] no so it's not wrong to be tempted it's
[1:14:54] wrong to yield to
[1:14:58] Temptation
[1:15:01] right that come these things what do you
[1:15:03] think about
[1:15:05] it what does it mean to be
[1:15:09] perfect when we'll never be perfect in
[1:15:11] No Man's eyes that's
[1:15:13] right but in God's eyes we are the Bride
[1:15:17] of Jesus Christ perfect
[1:15:20] right so wonderful he's when he connects
[1:15:23] with her in his Union to take her away
[1:15:26] until you know
[1:15:28] what the Millennium Temple will be
[1:15:30] erected in the
[1:15:32] Millennium and you know we will come
[1:15:34] back in the millennial ride according to
[1:15:36] Revelations 19 and according to brother
[1:15:39] Brandon I believe it's Daniel 70 weeks
[1:15:41] he said we will be the anointing to that
[1:15:43] Temple
[1:15:45] amen that's how much it can't be
[1:15:47] separated
[1:15:49] amen you can't separate him and her
[1:15:52] right because one am what we got bl's
