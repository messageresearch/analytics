[14:04] the name of Jesus Christ amen
[14:06] and haggai
[14:09] chapter one
[14:11] beginning at verse 1 and it says in the
[14:13] second year of Darius the king and the
[14:15] SEC in the sixth month and the first day
[14:18] of the month came the word of the Lord
[14:19] by haggai the prophet unto res unto
[14:22] zerubbabel the son of shethil the
[14:25] governor of Judah and to Joshua the son
[14:27] of Joshua dick the high priest saying
[14:30] thus speaketh the Lord of hosts saying
[14:33] this people say the time is not is not
[14:37] come
[14:37] the time that the Lord's House should be
[14:40] built
[14:43] then came the word of the Lord by haggai
[14:46] the prophet saying is it time for you
[14:48] owe you to dwell in your sealed houses
[14:51] and this house lie waste now therefore
[14:54] thus saith the Lord of hosts consider
[14:56] your ways you have so much and bring in
[14:58] little you eat but ye have not enough
[15:01] you drink but you're not filled with
[15:03] drink
[15:04] you clothe you but there is none warm
[15:07] but he that earneth wages and he that or
[15:10] if wages are wages to put it into a bag
[15:13] with holes thus death the Lord of hosts
[15:15] consider your ways go up to the mountain
[15:22] yeah go to the mountain
[15:25] and bring wood and build the house
[15:27] because that's the house we're building
[15:31] and I will take pleasure and I will be
[15:32] glorified to saith the Lord
[15:37] you look for much
[15:39] although it came to little
[15:41] and
[15:43] when you brought it home I didn't blow
[15:45] upon it why thus saith the Lord of hosts
[15:46] because of my house that is waste and
[15:50] you run every man unto his own house
[15:52] therefore the heaven over you is stayed
[15:56] from Dew and the Earth is stayed from
[15:58] her fruit
[15:59] and I called for a drought upon the land
[16:01] and upon the mountains and upon the corn
[16:03] and upon the new wine and upon the oil
[16:06] and upon that which the ground bringeth
[16:08] forth and upon men and upon cattle and
[16:11] upon all the Labor uh about all the
[16:14] labor of the hands
[16:17] and this is from First Peter chapter 1
[16:19] verse 2.
[16:21] and it says
[16:24] he also as Lively stones are built up a
[16:27] spiritual house and holy priesthood to
[16:30] offer a spiritual sacrifices acceptable
[16:33] to God by Jesus Christ amen God bless
[16:36] you may be seated
[16:41] and
[16:48] I was looking at something
[16:50] the other day and
[16:53] foreign
[16:56] looking at
[16:58] some things that brought me to this
[17:01] brought me to this scripture and
[17:03] we know that when the children of Israel
[17:06] they came out of
[17:07] Babylonian captivity
[17:10] we know that they came back and they
[17:12] were
[17:13] given the word to build rebuild the
[17:16] Temple
[17:18] and when we know that uh you know Cyrus
[17:21] was King when he allowed and he allowed
[17:23] when things opened up so they could come
[17:25] back in to build the temple they're
[17:28] actually able to come back into
[17:29] Jerusalem which was there was a promised
[17:31] land when they came out of captivity
[17:34] and when they when they came back you
[17:36] know we know Nehemiah and Ezra were
[17:39] there you know they had a desire to
[17:40] build to rebuild the Temple and were
[17:43] able to do some things and
[17:45] we know that the work was hindered after
[17:48] they started we know that the uh we know
[17:51] from the from the store we know that the
[17:53] Samaritans you know which were a mixed
[17:56] group they wanted to come in and they
[17:58] wanted to help them build rebuild the
[18:00] Temple but you know
[18:02] um
[18:04] zerubbabel in them uh the different ones
[18:07] the elders believe that no it's for us
[18:10] to build the Jews were to build rebuild
[18:12] the Temple because that was what God had
[18:15] given them and that was their work to do
[18:16] not anybody else's and not and not to
[18:19] have a mixed multitude but to have those
[18:21] that were fully Jews they were fully
[18:23] Believers to rebuild the Temple that was
[18:25] their work to
[18:27] bring that back and we know that you
[18:29] know they had a a lot of they had a lot
[18:31] of hendrits to go when we know through
[18:33] the scripture and studying the 70 weeks
[18:36] of Daniel we understand how how
[18:38] difficult it was for them to to rebuild
[18:40] and and the prophecy was given to them
[18:42] how they would have to hold a sword in a
[18:45] trial and they would have to work and
[18:46] look over their shoulders to watch
[18:48] because I always had to keep an eye on
[18:50] the enemy all the time as they were
[18:52] trying to rebuild this thing and it was
[18:53] a struggle for them to rebuild that
[18:55] Temple but they rebuilt that Temple and
[18:58] you know as they were building it and
[18:59] they had a lot of problems and we were
[19:02] reading here and haggai when he talks
[19:04] about when when they had so much trouble
[19:06] but when Darius became king then things
[19:08] opened up some more and Darius helped
[19:10] them with with some things and
[19:12] everything and they had to keep trying
[19:13] to uh
[19:15] energize the people to get to behind the
[19:18] work to do what God had given them to do
[19:20] because we know that God sent two
[19:23] prophets from the from this reading we
[19:25] know that haggai came and Zechariah was
[19:27] the other one that was really the
[19:29] spearhead behind stirring up the people
[19:31] to come back into building the Temple
[19:34] and this is what haggai was speaking of
[19:36] when he's writing the when he's writing
[19:38] this to zerubbabel and Joshua is because
[19:41] when he sees that the people the
[19:43] condition that the people are in and he
[19:46] begins to speak their and he says the
[19:48] Lord says that the people say that it's
[19:51] not time to build the house
[19:53] he said the people say that it's not
[19:55] time but but God is standing there and
[19:58] he's looking and he's saying but you're
[19:59] living in in your nice house you're
[20:02] living in a walled house and he said but
[20:06] the house of God what lays in Ruins and
[20:09] then as you see that you're you're
[20:11] building up things to yourself but you
[20:13] don't see the condition that the house
[20:15] of God is in and then you say but now is
[20:17] not the time to do that and he says then
[20:20] the word of the Lord came to haggai to
[20:22] the to the Israel to speak unto them and
[20:25] tell them he said is it now time he said
[20:27] can you can you say that it's not time
[20:29] when you see the utter ruin of the house
[20:32] of God but the house that you live in is
[20:34] all full of comfort you have all these
[20:36] Comforts to yourselves but you've not
[20:38] spent one dime you've not spent one
[20:41] moment trying to rebuild the house of
[20:43] God when God told you that you were
[20:45] supposed to go back and you know even in
[20:47] the in the chapters chapter two of hagga
[20:49] you know he brings it back to the people
[20:51] and he said who saw the former glory of
[20:54] the house who was the one that saw the
[20:56] first temple and he said remember he
[20:58] said but the word of the Lord come that
[21:00] the second temple would be greater than
[21:02] the first temple the glory of the second
[21:04] one would be greater than the first and
[21:06] yet he kept putting the vision before
[21:07] the people that it's time to rebuild the
[21:09] the house of God and as as Peter tells
[21:13] us we are a spiritual house to be built
[21:15] up to offer spiritual sacrifices unto
[21:18] God and we see how haggai was there
[21:20] trying to stir up the people to get into
[21:22] the work of God because this is the
[21:24] place where God's going to meet you this
[21:26] is what God wants this is what God
[21:28] requires but he tells them said listen
[21:30] he said y'all have have received all
[21:32] these things and he said but you've not
[21:35] taken any time you've not put anything
[21:37] into the work of God you've not done
[21:39] anything to help the work of God and he
[21:42] said you have you have labored but has
[21:44] not come to anything he said you work
[21:46] and all these other things that he talks
[21:48] about here he said everything that
[21:50] you've put your hands to is because of
[21:53] what you've done then when then he says
[21:56] consider your ways why because you've
[21:58] sown and it's all into the things that
[22:01] fill your pocket that that are your that
[22:04] are really just to your own lust to your
[22:06] own desire he said but you've not put
[22:08] anything into the house of God and he
[22:10] stands there and he says consider your
[22:12] ways and he said look he said because
[22:14] all that you've had and all that you've
[22:16] done and everything has went wrong in
[22:18] your way he said listen that's the
[22:19] reason that you're standing in sitting
[22:21] in the midst of a drought right now is
[22:23] because you failed to be at the house of
[22:25] God because you failed to prepare and go
[22:28] forward with the house of God and you
[22:30] know the thing is is you and I are
[22:32] spiritual or spiritual house for God we
[22:35] are we're God's dwelling place and if
[22:37] and not just not just meeting here but
[22:40] it's where you meet God every single day
[22:42] of your life what have you put aside to
[22:45] to meet God and and for God to meet you
[22:48] to have communion and so when he begins
[22:51] to speak I mean it talks about
[22:52] everything thing that they have had
[22:54] their hands to has failed he said he
[22:57] said you desire he said you're trying to
[22:59] eat and you it never comes to knock he
[23:01] said you try to drink and you're not and
[23:03] you're never ever satisfied you never
[23:06] you never you just continually be
[23:08] thirsty he said you're always cold
[23:10] there's everything wrong why because you
[23:12] have failed me
[23:14] why because if you want anything from
[23:16] God then you give God what you have
[23:19] why because if you want God to bless you
[23:21] then you've got to follow What God Says
[23:23] and he says they have gotten to a point
[23:25] where it was just such a terrible
[23:27] condition that they had gotten into that
[23:30] you see that how how terrible everything
[23:32] was around them and yet God was trying
[23:34] to call them back to the work of God
[23:36] they're trying to call them back to
[23:38] build this is the time to build the
[23:40] house of God and brothers and sisters I
[23:43] I wanted to say something tonight uh
[23:47] I'm gonna be a mess tonight but that's
[23:49] all right I'm gonna preach anyway
[23:50] but let me tell you something after the
[23:52] messages the last few messages that
[23:54] we've heard across this Pulpit I I tell
[23:59] you it it it it it there's a reason we
[24:01] have to take a more Earnest tea to what
[24:03] we've heard and not just allow things
[24:06] suggests to be just to be common or
[24:08] everyday kind of things but we've got to
[24:11] have a stirring to change us and who we
[24:13] and change who we are and not just allow
[24:15] it to be another service where we've
[24:17] just come and just heard the word of God
[24:19] and say well brother that was good and
[24:21] then we don't ever change why because
[24:24] what has been preached to us is a is a
[24:27] life-changing message and the thing is
[24:29] if it's not changing you then we need to
[24:31] go back because we've missed what has
[24:33] happened and I tell you where it has
[24:37] something that stirred me why because I
[24:39] have failed God and and and and he just
[24:42] preach on me tonight and that's okay
[24:44] because I need it because you know what
[24:46] I don't want I don't want to be the same
[24:48] Aaron Roberts that come in here tonight
[24:49] I don't want to be the same Aaron
[24:51] Roberts state was here but you're going
[24:53] from a year from now I don't want to be
[24:54] the same Aaron Roberts if I'm the same
[24:56] one that was a year from now and there's
[24:59] no been no change and you know what that
[25:00] I Lord to do something with me because I
[25:03] don't need to be this
[25:06] the biggest problem that I have is Aaron
[25:08] Roberts
[25:10] it's the one I wake up and look in the
[25:12] mirror at every day
[25:13] right
[25:17] and you know there's times
[25:19] you know
[25:21] things are said
[25:24] and you know the brother Branham had had
[25:27] problems with things that that people
[25:29] that because you've got to preach the
[25:31] word
[25:32] the the Five-0 Ministry has to preach
[25:35] the word you're giving you're it just
[25:37] just like all of the prophets the
[25:38] different ones everybody's been given a
[25:41] Ministry and they've been given a part
[25:43] to do and and you know what it's not
[25:45] always fun it's not always pleasant but
[25:47] it's what God has given you to do and
[25:50] when and brother Brandon's speaking in
[25:51] the in the message he that is in you I
[25:54] was I was listening to it today and you
[25:56] know brother Brown is speaking because
[25:57] the message that he preaches right
[25:59] before this and I don't it's not up
[26:01] there but uh one of the the message that
[26:04] brother Brandon preaches right before
[26:05] this is Souls that are in prison now and
[26:08] it begins to preach and you're talking
[26:10] about the condition that the world is in
[26:12] the church is in and how everything is
[26:14] in right now and he's like really
[26:15] because when you start to see us as
[26:17] brother Ryan was talking about when you
[26:19] see that that foolish virgin is coming
[26:22] for all he said realize he said it's
[26:24] already over with when the foolish
[26:26] virgin they're coming to the to the wise
[26:28] with with the old he said realize he
[26:30] said it's all over with because there's
[26:32] no oil for them to receive the old has
[26:34] been cut off there is no going back
[26:36] because when when it comes to the point
[26:38] when they've heard the voice set behold
[26:41] the bridegroom cometh when that voice
[26:43] went forth and to those people when they
[26:45] turned it down they're in outer Darkness
[26:47] there's no way to come back but only
[26:50] those that have the oil are able to go
[26:52] because they were able to rise up and
[26:54] trim their laps and go in and that's the
[26:56] only ones that are going in nobody else
[26:58] is going in and remember when he when he
[27:00] gets into this point and then you know
[27:02] he brother Brown you know he's he's
[27:04] dealing with this struggle because he
[27:07] calls a brother's name
[27:08] and I think brother white mentioned that
[27:10] and he's talking about you know he calls
[27:12] this brother's name and and you know
[27:13] when uh he you know he was so upset but
[27:15] you know brother Brandon when he when
[27:17] he's speaking here in this message you
[27:18] know he said he said you know he said
[27:21] it's hard to imagine what's on a man's
[27:23] heart because you know you're you're
[27:24] trying to do the best that you can but
[27:26] he said you know I realize some people
[27:28] are going to take the wrong slant to
[27:29] this he said they're not going to accept
[27:31] it the right way because a lot of people
[27:34] turn brother around him down but it
[27:36] wasn't what brother Branham was saying
[27:38] because he had it from a from what he
[27:40] said he said it was from a heart of love
[27:42] because he was saying what God had given
[27:44] him to say so he was only saying what
[27:46] thus saith the Lord he wasn't trying to
[27:48] he said I know my my friends are going
[27:50] to turn away from me he said he knew it
[27:52] was going to break churches and all
[27:54] kinds of things all the all the problems
[27:56] that David was going to create but you
[27:58] know what he had something that was down
[27:59] inside him that was burning inside of
[28:02] him
[28:03] you know he said he talked about he
[28:05] carried that burden with him you know he
[28:06] said I would go to the mountains and
[28:08] pray and he said I couldn't get rid of
[28:09] that burden he said I'd go to the
[28:10] seaside and pray and I couldn't get rid
[28:12] of that burden and there was something
[28:13] why because there was something that God
[28:15] wanted him to do
[28:17] and he said he kept battling with that
[28:18] burden but when he began to preach that
[28:20] message then he realized you know that
[28:22] burden lifted off of him and it was
[28:24] something that why because there was
[28:25] something that God wanted him to express
[28:27] and it was so hard
[28:30] right and brother Graham says he said
[28:33] how can you say it without hurting
[28:36] how can you say these things without
[28:38] hurting people's feelings how can you
[28:40] how he said how can you and it not take
[28:43] effect because you know when you say
[28:45] these things he's because he says how
[28:47] can I say it to show the people that I'm
[28:50] not picking on them that you love them
[28:52] how can you be strict and firm and yet
[28:54] be loving
[28:56] he said oh how you're going to present
[28:58] it and then woe unto me if I don't
[29:01] present it see and there you are see no
[29:03] wonder it keeps you nervous and tore up
[29:07] so when brother branham's trying to
[29:09] trying to express something to the
[29:11] people he's not trying to he's only
[29:13] doing what God wants him to do but he's
[29:14] showing it from a way of love that he's
[29:16] showing what the position the condition
[29:18] the world's in this is what's going on
[29:20] this is what we got to do
[29:22] and it's just like he said when you sold
[29:25] those people when the when they're
[29:26] coming to the falls and and there's
[29:28] somebody's in a little John Boat or
[29:29] whatever and realizing they're not gonna
[29:31] they're not going to survive the Rapids
[29:32] they're not going to survive and all you
[29:34] can do is stand out there and yell at
[29:36] them
[29:37] it's not it's not because you're mad at
[29:39] them you're not trying to pick on them
[29:41] he said but it's from a Heart of Love
[29:43] you're trying to tell people the
[29:44] condition where you're at and listen you
[29:46] don't realize what danger you're in
[29:49] you're not going to survive
[29:51] you're not going to make it
[29:55] right and and so when you when you come
[29:57] to that see that then it becomes a very
[29:59] difficult position to be in because
[30:01] you've got to preach the word
[30:03] but you realize people are not going to
[30:05] accept it the way you preach it
[30:09] and then because people when when
[30:12] who was it uh
[30:15] was it Jeremiah that said you know
[30:17] because he had he said well you know I'm
[30:19] just not going to speak the word of the
[30:20] Lord anymore
[30:22] why because everybody turned him down
[30:25] the more he preached the more more he
[30:27] options of opposition that he had the
[30:29] more problems that he had and anybody
[30:31] just said let's I'm not going to speak
[30:33] in the name of the Lord anymore he said
[30:35] I'm just tired of speaking but he said
[30:37] didn't the word of the Lord came to him
[30:39] and he said it was like fire shut up in
[30:40] his bones why because it was something
[30:42] that he had to say
[30:45] and you know sometimes sometimes we get
[30:47] to the point where you know we think
[30:48] well somebody's just picking on me or
[30:50] whatever maybe it's not maybe it's the
[30:52] Lord speaking to you and he's trying to
[30:54] get your attention but the problem is
[30:56] that sometimes as bro as well later
[30:58] later on sometimes our our problem is
[31:01] our stubbornness is our problem is and
[31:03] that's what gets us in trouble because
[31:05] we get hardened by things and we get
[31:07] offended by things and that stops the
[31:09] move of God that's what stops the move
[31:11] of God in our life is because we've
[31:13] gotten offended and sometimes we like to
[31:15] get behind that and we just like to hide
[31:17] behind that little little pet feeling or
[31:19] whatever our little complex and it holds
[31:21] up the work of God it hurt it hurts the
[31:24] family it hurts the church and we don't
[31:26] realize how much danger we are when we
[31:29] have that happen and we don't do
[31:30] anything about it
[31:33] come on
[31:35] now this is this is from the message the
[31:37] blushing prophet
[31:42] and it says listen it says it ought to
[31:45] be the happiest time in the world to the
[31:48] Christian for the Christian times are
[31:50] going to change the old's going to
[31:52] become young oh my death's going to flee
[31:55] away sickness will be no more no more
[31:58] prayer meetings for the sick no more
[32:00] prayer meetings for the loss but God
[32:02] shall come and take the elect from the
[32:04] Four Winds of the earth and Shall Gather
[32:05] them under his own wings and we'll live
[32:08] and reign with him forever in his Heaven
[32:10] O Brother sisters friend of mine if
[32:12] you're not prepared tonight may you be
[32:14] prepared at this hour I give you an
[32:17] invitation to come to Christ Jesus
[32:19] tonight and receive you that's been
[32:21] different you that know that you're not
[32:24] where you should be with God I invite
[32:26] you to the altar with myself I invite
[32:28] every one of you to come here and not
[32:31] only to say but to stay here until God
[32:34] has cleansed your soul from everything
[32:35] that's unlike him until you can go out
[32:38] of here a new person not with a corn
[32:41] plaster own but go out of here with a
[32:44] blood transfusion that purifies your
[32:46] blood and gives you new life and New
[32:48] Hope go out of here with the baptism of
[32:50] the Holy Ghost go out not shouting not
[32:52] dancing not so much them things are all
[32:54] right but they all belong in the church
[32:56] they are they belong in the Bible they
[32:59] are belong in the Bible but what I'm
[33:00] talking
[33:02] what I'm talking about is the Holy Ghost
[33:05] God's love
[33:08] now brother I'm continues out here
[33:11] and he talks about this young man that
[33:13] came to him and he said his mom had a
[33:15] desire
[33:17] to have a have a closer walk with God
[33:20] said I made a man young man he's talking
[33:22] the other day they said oh honey to her
[33:25] boy come here I want you to look I have
[33:27] oil in my hands well I have too it's
[33:30] here I've been sweating now he said I've
[33:32] got all so she's talking about I've got
[33:34] oil in my hand said what do you think of
[33:36] that
[33:37] and the boy looked at his mother and
[33:39] said mother I want to ask you something
[33:42] she just wanted him to pray wanted him
[33:44] to pray that she'd have a closer walk
[33:46] with God
[33:47] he said when it all come in your hand
[33:49] did it take away all your condemnation
[33:52] did it give you a sweet experience with
[33:54] god well no then I'd leave it alone
[33:57] that's it oh the world the religious
[34:00] world the Pentecostal people are all
[34:02] looking for Fantastics the world the
[34:04] educated so-called world the
[34:05] nominational world is looking for some
[34:07] great solution that they can embedder
[34:09] their denomination and get more members
[34:11] a million more and 44.
[34:15] and it continues on about the Nations
[34:17] and everything the Pentecostals he said
[34:19] but it comes by surrendered life to
[34:22] Jesus Christ through the baptism of the
[34:23] Holy Ghost anything short of that it's
[34:26] wrong
[34:30] now
[34:34] I just you know because
[34:36] it really struck me when I read that
[34:38] because you know it is supposed to be
[34:40] the happiest time in the world for us
[34:41] and let me tell you something about
[34:43] sisters this is the great and terrible
[34:44] day of the Lord and we we ought to be
[34:46] happy and we are blessed above all
[34:48] measure but let me tell you something
[34:50] brother sisters if you're not there if
[34:52] you've done if you're if this is not if
[34:53] you've not as as he was talking to that
[34:55] that son was talking to his mom if
[34:57] you've not had that sweet experience if
[35:00] you've not had a life-changing
[35:01] experience with God then he said you
[35:03] need to come now and come to the altar
[35:05] you know don't need to wait and don't
[35:06] don't second-guess yourself because you
[35:09] know what if something is hindering you
[35:10] if something holds you back whatever it
[35:12] is you know because as brother Dale's
[35:14] always said I'd rather seek God every
[35:16] day of my life and know that I've had it
[35:18] the whole time this then try to guess
[35:20] whether I had it and play around with
[35:22] God and realize I didn't have it and all
[35:24] of a sudden one day I realize I'm on the
[35:26] wrong side because you know what it's a
[35:28] late hour and we can't play with church
[35:30] anymore you can't play with God you
[35:32] don't play with his word
[35:33] right it's time to change it's it so
[35:37] we've been called to that it's a time
[35:39] that we need to understand what needs to
[35:41] what needs to take place because not
[35:43] just not just having an idea or reading
[35:46] books or coming to church or all that
[35:48] kind of stuff but you've got to know
[35:49] that you've got to know that you got to
[35:51] know you've got to have a stake driven
[35:53] down and where where all the storms that
[35:56] all the hell all the devils in hell
[35:58] can't shake you from it you know where
[36:00] you're standing you know what God has
[36:02] done for you you know that your uh
[36:04] Temple of the Living God
[36:07] that's right
[36:09] he said I would he said if it if it
[36:11] didn't bring you to that why because
[36:13] it's so it's so easy to fall into a trap
[36:17] where where people have had some kind of
[36:20] emotional experience where where
[36:22] something is taking place in their life
[36:24] and then they think this is this is it
[36:26] and they drive it down and all of a
[36:28] sudden the next time you you see them
[36:30] they're out back in the world or they're
[36:31] they've Fallen back into the same traps
[36:34] they're saying back into the same thing
[36:35] that they were that they came out of and
[36:37] they're they never can get victory over
[36:39] why because they're going right back to
[36:40] it why because they've not reached the
[36:42] place that they need to that they have
[36:44] not stayed as brothers said you got to
[36:46] stay there until something changes until
[36:48] God until you know that God speaks to
[36:51] you that God has has done something in
[36:53] your life that he has filled you with
[36:55] the Holy Ghost that he's changed your
[36:57] life
[37:01] but many people they've not gotten to
[37:03] that point
[37:10] this is from the message
[37:12] the Queen of Sheba Brothers says you
[37:14] know Faith cometh by hearing talking
[37:15] about it and
[37:18] I want you to listen to some of these he
[37:20] said we don't do enough talking this is
[37:22] number number two so we don't do enough
[37:24] talking
[37:25] about the good things of God tonight the
[37:28] Church of the Living God is is took up
[37:30] too much on talking about television
[37:32] programs some kind of a ball game or
[37:35] something on that order he said we we
[37:37] should be testifying to the power of the
[37:39] resurrection of Jesus Christ and let
[37:41] your whole life be wrapped up in that
[37:44] because many times people you know they
[37:46] they get so wrapped up in so many other
[37:48] things outside of the word of God
[37:50] outside of the the gospel that when they
[37:53] when you try to talk to people they
[37:54] don't know anything
[37:57] we we've gotten so lacks that we spend
[38:01] more time and it's all and it's okay to
[38:03] have in entertainment it's it's all
[38:05] right to have enjoyment and all those
[38:07] type things but the problem is is we
[38:09] find people that that claim to claim to
[38:12] follow the message and claim to be a
[38:14] Christian and claim to be a believer but
[38:16] you know what they have they have better
[38:18] uh
[38:20] and I have better attendance at the ball
[38:23] game or at Walmart or at work than they
[38:26] do in the house of God now brother Brown
[38:28] said one time he said it was all right
[38:30] to miss work but he said don't miss the
[38:31] house of God
[38:33] but you know there's a lot of people you
[38:35] know they they they they like that
[38:37] little gold star or whatever they get at
[38:39] work you know their little bonus or
[38:42] whatever they get the pat on the back
[38:43] they got perfect attendance
[38:47] whatever whatever you get for having
[38:49] perfect attendance at work but I tell
[38:50] you what you know what this this is a
[38:52] whole lot more important than than being
[38:55] perfect and having perfect attendance at
[38:57] at some at work at a job
[39:00] because your job's not going to last
[39:02] forever
[39:05] some people they sweat and tall and they
[39:07] do everything they can today as as they
[39:09] say people are company people you know
[39:11] they do anything in the world for the
[39:12] company but the problem is is the
[39:14] company don't give you anything in
[39:16] return you know the thing is is you know
[39:18] you can you can give everything that you
[39:20] have and pour your heart and soul into a
[39:22] job and the problem is is the first time
[39:24] they change management you're on the
[39:27] street before you can blink your eyes
[39:28] they don't care
[39:32] you can do everything you can to help
[39:34] people out and the next time you know
[39:35] there's all of a sudden you're pulling
[39:37] four or five knives out of your back
[39:40] you don't get you don't get no respect
[39:43] but people but people are so wrapped up
[39:45] and and working a job
[39:49] no we gotta we got to work to live and
[39:51] all this kind of stuff but you know what
[39:52] it's not it's not the greatest thing in
[39:54] the world
[39:57] working the job ain't gonna put you
[40:00] gonna put you in the rapture
[40:02] it ain't going to get you anywhere
[40:05] all this stuff's gonna pass away
[40:12] this is from the from the message
[40:16] second hand Road brother Brown says
[40:20] he's talking about his his mom he says
[40:23] and now here's it may hurt just a little
[40:25] bit but my mother used to give me when
[40:27] we was poor said we used to eat
[40:29] cornbread and with grease and meat skins
[40:31] and everything you know she said and
[40:33] every Saturday night I know we used to
[40:35] have to take a dose of castor oil he
[40:37] said I can't stand it today my mom used
[40:39] to say I'd hold my notes and Mama it
[40:41] makes me so sick I can't even bear it
[40:43] she said if it don't make you sick don't
[40:45] do you any good so maybe that is with
[40:48] preaching the gospel if it doesn't stir
[40:50] you up a little bit and I'm afraid today
[40:52] that many of us that are claiming great
[40:55] things of God are only carnal
[40:56] impersonations someone else the way they
[40:59] act they act in the way they do and you
[41:01] try to put the same thing on yourself
[41:03] and act that way
[41:05] when Christianity is not a mimic it's a
[41:09] life Christianity comes by birth that
[41:11] when you're born again of the spirit of
[41:13] God and become a new creature in Christ
[41:14] Jesus old things are passed away and All
[41:17] Things become new watch
[41:20] so when he's speaking of these things
[41:22] you know why because they're they're
[41:24] when the word of God
[41:26] why because people get so wrapped up in
[41:28] all these other things that are around
[41:29] us but the problem is is sometimes the
[41:31] word of God has to come and correct the
[41:34] situation and be stirred up by it
[41:36] because sometimes
[41:37] you wonder why why do what people what
[41:41] people are and what's happened to people
[41:43] and why the condition that they're in
[41:46] come on
[41:47] about the about the joke they would and
[41:49] you know I know that's not a place to
[41:50] joke but it you know it illustrates the
[41:52] point but they were talking about the
[41:54] people that sat in the church for so
[41:55] long that when the move of God come come
[41:57] by they just sat there and had sat there
[41:59] in the church for so long when the move
[42:01] of God took place all of a sudden they
[42:02] had a dust storm in the church because
[42:04] all the dust had settles were shaking
[42:06] off the people because they had set in
[42:08] the church for so long they had dust
[42:10] settled on them
[42:12] why because they had never had a move of
[42:14] God why because they just sat there and
[42:15] know that well we just come in and we
[42:17] just sat down and we we just do it we
[42:20] just do our little uh religious
[42:22] ordinance and then we leave
[42:23] but they don't know how but they've not
[42:25] had a move of God and then you know God
[42:27] God can be moving all around them and
[42:29] they don't have no idea what's going on
[42:33] they come in and they walk out the same
[42:35] way and when when the when the brothers
[42:37] have called for for people to come up
[42:39] and you know when like when brother
[42:41] Ronnie and different ones are here and
[42:43] you know when they come and you know the
[42:44] Lord's moving and you know what people
[42:45] just like well
[42:49] they're still they're still sitting
[42:51] there yeah
[42:55] see God God can't God can only move he
[42:58] can only call you've got to respond if
[43:00] you don't respond God can't do anything
[43:02] else
[43:03] right
[43:04] amen but are you building up a house of
[43:06] God a house where God can dwell I got a
[43:09] house that God has pleased in a house
[43:11] that God can be glorified
[43:19] this is from the message
[43:21] a deceived Church
[43:23] by the world President says for God can
[43:26] keep anyone and use anyone that he that
[43:29] will follow after him for it's God's
[43:31] business but when we turn aside oh we
[43:34] turn aside away from the things of God
[43:36] then God cannot use us any longer when
[43:39] we'll walk steadfastly after the
[43:42] Commandments of God then we'll stay in
[43:44] the pages when we stay on the pages of
[43:46] the Bible and worship by the written
[43:48] word worship him in the spirit and in
[43:51] truth of the word then God can use and
[43:53] in any individual
[43:55] but when they take a notion to turn
[43:57] aside from after something else
[44:00] then God cannot use that person any
[44:03] longer
[44:05] so when when God has has a desire to be
[44:08] to use because you know what when God
[44:11] calls an individual into into this Army
[44:14] as as brother Wade keeps telling us you
[44:17] know we're not on we're not on a cruise
[44:20] ship we're in a battleship
[44:22] you know God didn't call us on no Club
[44:24] Med vacation this is a this is Battle
[44:27] this is a Warfare and you know there's
[44:29] there's one thing that that I want to
[44:31] say tonight when when you see the
[44:33] condition that things are in you know
[44:35] brother Donnie and the different ones
[44:36] that have served in the military you
[44:38] know when you go in the military you
[44:40] don't go in there to uh just just to
[44:44] stare at the walls
[44:46] that you've got a job to do
[44:48] right and you know brother Bob said
[44:50] every believer's got a job we've got a
[44:51] part to play
[44:53] we've got something to do
[44:55] you go you go find anybody that's been
[44:57] in this in the Army when you are the
[45:00] military the Marines whatever you've got
[45:02] a job to do they train you to do
[45:04] something amen
[45:06] amen the first thing the first thing
[45:07] that that when you go into places like
[45:10] the Marines the first thing the Marines
[45:11] teach you is how to that you know they
[45:13] want you to realize that you are a
[45:15] fighting machine
[45:17] you are a man of war
[45:20] you are a killing machine that's your
[45:23] first job
[45:25] first thing you've got to understand
[45:26] when you come in here it's no longer I
[45:29] or me it's it's you as a group you work
[45:32] together because there ain't no there
[45:34] ain't no there ain't no freelance going
[45:36] on there ain't no long Rangers
[45:37] everybody's working together and we've
[45:40] all got to come and go they get rid of
[45:42] all that other stuff because you've got
[45:44] to learn how to walk in step with
[45:45] everybody else you've got a job to do
[45:48] and the first thing you got to do is
[45:49] realize the first thing you got to do is
[45:51] understand you're a person of War you're
[45:54] a soldier you're a warrior
[45:56] not a warrior you're a warrior
[46:01] we fight we don't worry
[46:03] God never gave us a spirit of fear he
[46:06] didn't give us a spirit of confusion he
[46:07] didn't give us a spirit of worry he gave
[46:10] us a spirit to fight
[46:12] to believe the word and fight
[46:15] now when he gives us that when we become
[46:17] a soldier in the army of God then the
[46:19] first thing he does is he teaches us how
[46:21] to battle
[46:24] and the first thing you do is you
[46:26] realize you do everything the way the
[46:28] Marine Corps taught you
[46:30] you go to bed when they tell you too and
[46:32] you go to bed the way they teach you to
[46:33] do it you get up the way they teach you
[46:35] to do it everything has to be done their
[46:37] way
[46:39] why because it's imprinted in your mind
[46:41] so when everything that you do has a
[46:44] reputation a repetition everything has a
[46:47] way of doing it so when you don't have
[46:48] to think about what you have to do
[46:52] when you're called upon you just act
[46:56] so what did Jesus tell me he said in
[46:58] that day
[46:59] he said he said take no thought what
[47:02] you'll say why because the Holy Ghost
[47:05] will give you the words to say
[47:07] so how do you get the words to say well
[47:10] he just gonna draw no you need to be in
[47:12] the word
[47:14] you've got to sow the word in
[47:18] so when you learn how to be a soldier
[47:20] then you've got another job you've got
[47:22] to learn how to do
[47:25] a lot of a lot of Marines you know they
[47:28] are they are combat infantrymen
[47:31] right
[47:32] they know how they know how to get off
[47:34] of a ship
[47:35] swim they hit a beach head and they're
[47:37] going to take it over
[47:40] and they lock it down
[47:43] and that's their job
[47:46] and it doesn't matter some people some
[47:48] of them they go in there and they can
[47:50] they can shoot a gun and they can dig a
[47:52] hole and all those type things but their
[47:54] other job is everything else and some
[47:57] people they're plumbers
[47:59] there's people that are Cooks
[48:01] some are medics whatever your job is but
[48:04] there's another job so you don't you
[48:06] just don't sit around and look at the
[48:08] walls
[48:11] there's something that you have to do
[48:15] I was thinking about Amanda years ago
[48:17] that that he's certain he wanted to join
[48:19] during Vietnam he thought well I'm going
[48:21] to get in I'm going to join and get
[48:23] ahead so I don't have to I don't have to
[48:25] go to Vietnam he said I'm gonna go win
[48:26] I'm gonna get in I'm gonna get in a a
[48:29] branch of service I'm gonna stay out of
[48:31] of all of that I'm gonna try to find
[48:33] something that's safe to do and so he
[48:35] went to the Navy he thought hating the
[48:37] Navy's a good easy job it's safe I can I
[48:40] can I can handle this for a few years
[48:42] I'll be okay so he went in he was
[48:45] looking at the list he said I saw the
[48:46] thing where it said cook he said hey I
[48:48] think I can do that I think I'd be
[48:50] pretty safe had a recruiter come by and
[48:52] say hey man you don't want to be no cook
[48:53] he said I got a great job for you he
[48:56] said well I'm listening he said I want
[48:58] you to be a hospital corpsman he said
[49:00] what's a hospital corpsman he said well
[49:02] it's a really neat job you get to hang
[49:04] out with all these pretty nurses in the
[49:06] hospital and then you get to pass out
[49:08] drugs and help a little bit in the
[49:10] hospital and you help these people he
[49:11] said hey I think I can handle that
[49:14] so he signed up to be a hospital
[49:16] corpsman
[49:20] well
[49:21] he got into his training he got through
[49:23] that they shipped him off to Corman
[49:25] School guess what he found out there
[49:28] ain't no such thing as that in the Navy
[49:31] a hospital corpsman or a Navy corpsman
[49:34] is a Navy medic and if you want to know
[49:37] where the Navy Medics end up they get
[49:39] attached to Marine Corps units so he
[49:42] said I spent three and a half years in
[49:44] the Navy attached to Marine Corps units
[49:46] and they said the first thing I got done
[49:48] was got shipped to Vietnam and he said I
[49:51] was the one that was over there
[49:52] bandaging up these guys that had been
[49:54] shot up and brought up and everything
[49:55] else and trying to patch them up he said
[49:58] the person the place that I didn't want
[49:59] to end up is where I ended up
[50:02] right
[50:04] so not you know everybody just don't
[50:06] have some cushy job but there's a job
[50:09] that you've got to do
[50:13] and so when when God has called you to a
[50:15] place God just gives us a job to do and
[50:18] whether whether it's preaching the
[50:20] gospel playing an instrument being a
[50:22] deacon or or cleaning the church or
[50:25] whatever it is or just coming to church
[50:27] and shine in the light and saying Amen
[50:29] to the gospel then that's our that's
[50:31] what your job is
[50:33] whatever your job is and that's what
[50:35] you're do that's what your job is
[50:37] because it's we come here and we and we
[50:40] meet together and we recharge our
[50:42] batteries and you know we praise the
[50:44] Lord and we get we get energized and we
[50:46] make it through to the next service and
[50:47] you know we just Feast on the good
[50:49] things of God but you know when you walk
[50:51] out that door you've got to be ready
[50:54] you've got to be ready to battle
[50:57] God didn't call us to this to be losers
[51:00] God didn't call us to be to be failures
[51:06] what if God if God called me to to this
[51:10] place and you know what then he then if
[51:11] he's already done it then I don't have
[51:13] to worry about whether he's going to do
[51:15] it or not
[51:18] why because if if I have been sealed by
[51:22] the Holy Ghost until the day of my
[51:24] Redemption then then tell me what day is
[51:28] that going to be what time is there
[51:29] going to be that I'm not going to be
[51:31] ready
[51:32] that I don't have the blessings of God
[51:34] now I don't have to accept them
[51:37] just as what he's preaching on last time
[51:39] I don't have to go to court
[51:43] I can have the rights to go to court and
[51:46] have a judgment against the devil and
[51:48] having kicked out but if I don't
[51:49] exercise the rights then it's not
[51:51] anything for me
[51:53] I don't get any benefit of it
[51:55] right if God if he's if he's if he took
[51:57] all those stripes upon his back for my
[52:00] healing and then I go in and cry out to
[52:02] God and where will you heal me
[52:07] hey man
[52:10] amen can you imagine that
[52:15] it's it's so amazing it's just like
[52:17] somebody running by holding out holding
[52:19] out a water 100 bills trying to give
[52:21] them to you like I don't I don't know
[52:22] about that
[52:26] well if somebody pulled out if Terence
[52:28] pulled out 100 bunch of hundred dollar
[52:29] bills and had them
[52:32] we know that won't happen but you know
[52:36] that'd be a miracle but anyway God works
[52:38] Miracle spinning me
[52:39] you know if somebody if somebody had
[52:41] that you know then well I I don't know
[52:43] about that
[52:46] that's right but you know God God's not
[52:49] that way
[52:52] so you so you don't trust what God Said
[52:56] you won't trust what God Said
[53:01] well it's like well you know God healed
[53:04] me
[53:05] two or three years ago
[53:07] but I don't know about today
[53:10] and then you come to church and we say
[53:11] well we got a praise report
[53:13] this one's being healed and that one's
[53:15] been healed and this one's been healed
[53:16] and that one's been healed and God moved
[53:17] in this situation they've done all these
[53:19] great things and then we sit there and
[53:20] well I wonder if he'll do it for me
[53:23] yeah
[53:26] cornbread and it's like well the the
[53:29] Bible says that that you know if I if I
[53:32] would just trust him and and I would
[53:34] just try him he said he'd open up the
[53:36] windows of heaven and pour out a
[53:37] blessing I couldn't contain
[53:39] but I don't know I don't know if that's
[53:40] true or not
[53:43] if you if God said it then why is it
[53:45] that we won't we won't believe it
[53:49] and people say well you know I get in
[53:51] here brother Wade and I get to looking
[53:52] at this stuff and you know sometimes my
[53:54] eyes cross I I get to reading this stuff
[53:56] and I'm so confused on all this stuff
[53:58] and I began to read these things and and
[54:00] it looks like one way and it looks like
[54:01] I I can't figure it out and you know
[54:03] well
[54:05] we don't try to figure it out
[54:09] but you know what I've got a promise in
[54:11] the Bible
[54:13] where he said where brother Branham said
[54:15] he because he said the the spirit of
[54:18] Truth he said how about when he the
[54:20] spirit of Truth is coming to lead you
[54:21] and guide you into all truth
[54:22] it ain't going to be a mystery
[54:25] it's going to be a revelation
[54:28] and brother Bradham said a real true
[54:30] Eagle will understand
[54:32] well then you know what if I'm a real
[54:34] true eagle and he's opened this up to me
[54:36] then guess what that I can understand it
[54:38] he said he said this the Bible this
[54:41] message can be understood by the most
[54:43] illiterate
[54:45] well praise God I'm not there but you
[54:47] know I might be at the bottom somewhere
[54:49] but I may not be that but at least he
[54:51] put me in that in that class
[54:56] you know you know
[55:00] we we see people sometimes and and
[55:04] you you wonder about people and you know
[55:06] because we allow the devil to talk to us
[55:09] and get in our mouth and you know
[55:11] sometimes it's nice to understand
[55:13] because you know you have you have an
[55:15] Understanding God's able to touch you
[55:18] and he's able to speak to you and praise
[55:20] God we we all can read and write you
[55:23] know what we got through it you know
[55:25] High School most of us we got through
[55:27] past the third grade or seventh grade or
[55:29] whatever it was
[55:31] you know I think sometimes when you know
[55:33] I can read I can I can listen I can
[55:36] understand all these things I can look
[55:37] up words and all this kind of stuff and
[55:39] I think about brother Jill Forney he
[55:41] couldn't even read
[55:45] could read it all couldn't didn't know
[55:46] nothing and the Lord come down to
[55:48] supernaturally touched him where he
[55:49] could start reading so he could able to
[55:51] study the Bible and read the Bible and
[55:53] study the message
[55:55] well guess what y'all wasn't that far
[55:57] gone y'all were above that
[56:01] and he worked the supernatural miracle
[56:03] in Brother Jules life that he could do
[56:05] that well you know what y'all don't have
[56:06] that we didn't have that problem
[56:10] well then then if if God was able he was
[56:13] mindful of somebody that had faith that
[56:15] put his confidence in God that he could
[56:17] do that for him well you know what we we
[56:19] should be able to get above that
[56:22] well I don't I don't know well you know
[56:24] what you never you never will until you
[56:26] actually come to the place where you
[56:28] actually realize you know what I'm not
[56:29] going to listen to what the devil has to
[56:31] say I'm going to put my faith in What
[56:33] God Says
[56:35] [Applause]
[56:46] so when we read the scripture then and
[56:48] we pray about it when we read what God
[56:50] says and we pray about it then we
[56:51] realize have the Holy Ghost well I'm
[56:54] just going to hold this right I don't
[56:55] understand this but I know that the Holy
[56:57] Ghost will come amen
[56:59] God God is awesome brother I've said
[57:01] that if you had a question that he's
[57:03] obligated to put somebody behind the
[57:05] pulpit that can answer your question
[57:09] and sometimes it's it's amazing because
[57:12] you're I I've got a little iPod beside
[57:15] the bed I listen to brother Brandon at
[57:16] night
[57:17] and it and it's pretty amazing because I
[57:19] woke up in the middle of the night three
[57:21] o'clock in the morning I hear Brother
[57:22] random start preaching though brother
[57:23] random says stuff and all of a sudden
[57:25] it's like catches my attention when I
[57:27] pull out my phone because I've got the
[57:29] message on my phone I start looking up
[57:30] the quote because I start reading what
[57:32] brother Brandon said because sometimes I
[57:33] hear and I think did he actually say
[57:35] that because it catches your attention
[57:37] and it's like well the Lord's speaking
[57:39] to you and it's like wow that's amazing
[57:41] and all of a sudden you go back and you
[57:42] start reading and it's like hey I got to
[57:43] hold on to that one because that was a
[57:44] good nugget
[57:45] I done something for me and it's just
[57:47] like he speaks to you well you know
[57:49] that's the whole thing is when you
[57:50] listen right right or you read then
[57:53] sometimes you you've read you've read
[57:55] the same thing over and over and over
[57:58] here and it ain't done anything for you
[58:02] you know it may be the fifth time the
[58:04] 500th time you read it and all of a
[58:06] sudden all of a sudden it just opens up
[58:08] and you see everything in a brand new
[58:10] because when you come to the place you
[58:12] read the scripture and it's just like
[58:14] well that doesn't mean it just I lost
[58:17] confused but you know you just stay in
[58:19] the word and wait till it opens
[58:22] that's it you know I I've had scriptures
[58:25] that I've seen that that looks that look
[58:28] so contrary or looks so so confusing and
[58:31] all of a sudden the next time you read
[58:33] them after the Lord opens them up to you
[58:34] you will never ever read them the same
[58:37] way you did before
[58:40] his brother I'm talking about he said
[58:42] you know he said I packed the Baptist
[58:43] Bible he said I read them with Baptist
[58:45] glasses and he said all that but he said
[58:47] when the Holy Spirit came and he opened
[58:49] up the word then it became a new book to
[58:51] him that he could never saw it the same
[58:53] way he saw it before
[58:55] then you can only ever have to see it
[58:57] the same way before that you saw it
[58:59] before
[59:00] you can never see it the same way
[59:05] now this is from the message
[59:07] hear ye him
[59:12] brother Brian says Jesus never gathers
[59:14] his people just to be gathering
[59:16] he said Christ never did anything
[59:18] Loosely and I think that's the problem
[59:20] with the church today we take too many
[59:22] things of God Loosely and now I
[59:24] perceived that this is a Pentecostal
[59:26] Gathering listen if you're my brother's
[59:28] sisters but the Pentecostal people are
[59:30] too Loosely with the gifts that's in the
[59:32] church and that's the reason God can't
[59:33] respect them see you just get them
[59:36] let them go any old way they shouldn't
[59:39] be they should be governed and put in
[59:41] order and then he continues on talk
[59:43] about people speaking in tongues in
[59:45] meetings and everything and he says
[59:48] and so you understand he said then it's
[59:50] confusion how they're working but he
[59:52] says the gift he said the prophets the
[59:55] spirits of the prophets are subject to
[59:57] the prophet
[59:58] he said so he said so we we so misuse
[1:00:03] these things just letting it go
[1:00:05] freelance
[1:00:07] that's just as good as the devil would
[1:00:09] want it to
[1:00:13] well that's just because if if you get
[1:00:15] it out of La if you get it out of order
[1:00:17] that's just as bad as not using it at
[1:00:19] all
[1:00:21] because you exactly you've just created
[1:00:24] all this confusion he said that's right
[1:00:26] he said them gifts had been set in order
[1:00:28] and put in place that that have that had
[1:00:31] been a Revival sweep this land today
[1:00:33] that's never been exceeded he said we
[1:00:36] don't lack power we lack knowledge we
[1:00:40] lack Faith you got power any man that's
[1:00:43] born again has the whole Heavens the
[1:00:46] whole Heavens is open to him
[1:00:48] so the problem is that we don't have we
[1:00:51] don't lack power he said we lack faith
[1:00:54] and we lack knowledge
[1:00:57] and what struck me about that is see
[1:00:59] when you have all these gifts God has
[1:01:01] given you a gift so if God's called you
[1:01:03] into this place of being in a battle
[1:01:06] being in an army then God has given you
[1:01:08] a gift everybody has a gift to use
[1:01:14] whatever your gift is and that you need
[1:01:16] to find out what your gift is
[1:01:19] I know and some people's problem is is
[1:01:21] they don't know what their gift is and
[1:01:23] they never try to seek an answer to come
[1:01:25] to a place where God shows them what
[1:01:27] their what their gift is so they don't
[1:01:29] know how to operate they don't know what
[1:01:31] they can do to help people why because
[1:01:33] they never sat down and stole God about
[1:01:35] it
[1:01:36] and so there's a gift of God that's in
[1:01:39] the body that's not being used
[1:01:42] and then if we and if we misuse our
[1:01:44] gifts and we don't operate on the right
[1:01:46] in the correct manner then we realize he
[1:01:48] said that's worse than you know that's
[1:01:50] just that's so good as the devil wants
[1:01:52] you to do because then it all creates
[1:01:54] all this confusion
[1:01:58] he said but we don't like power he said
[1:02:00] we lack knowledge
[1:02:03] say you got to have faith to come up
[1:02:05] that statue of a perfect man to come to
[1:02:07] the place where you've getting knowledge
[1:02:09] because there is knowledge in the Holy
[1:02:11] Ghost but you've got to come to this
[1:02:13] place where you have knowledge where
[1:02:15] it's sealed in
[1:02:18] but if we want it but if we want to be
[1:02:19] used of God then that's what we've got
[1:02:21] to do we've got power but we've got to
[1:02:23] be able to use it
[1:02:27] and God has and God has more power has
[1:02:30] more gifts than he wants you to do he
[1:02:31] has things he wants you to do but the
[1:02:33] problem is you've got to come to the
[1:02:34] place where he can use you
[1:02:39] we've got to come to that place where
[1:02:40] we're able to be utilized of God to be
[1:02:43] the living instrumentality of Jesus
[1:02:45] Christ to be able to be used in the way
[1:02:47] that God wants us to be used
[1:02:50] not just to be
[1:02:52] holding back
[1:02:58] you know it's just like people collect
[1:03:00] things and you know
[1:03:04] you know
[1:03:05] I worked with a guy one time and and you
[1:03:07] know he he was a he was a good guy
[1:03:11] he was smart
[1:03:13] but you know like the company bought him
[1:03:15] tools and you know he just wanted he
[1:03:17] just wanted to see how long he could
[1:03:18] keep all these tools in plastic
[1:03:21] yeah
[1:03:24] it's like
[1:03:25] he's like well you know he said I I what
[1:03:27] I want what I want to do is I want to
[1:03:29] turn them back in when I quit in the
[1:03:32] same condition I got them in
[1:03:36] well you ought to quit now then
[1:03:41] but that's that's but that's people's
[1:03:43] mentality
[1:03:46] you know it's just like collecting a
[1:03:48] bunch of uh
[1:03:51] porcelain
[1:03:53] what nots and all kinds of stuff
[1:03:55] knickknacks and all that kind of stuff
[1:03:56] got to build up these nice little
[1:03:58] shelves put all this stuff on where you
[1:03:59] was it to collect dust
[1:04:02] and that's I mean that's okay that's
[1:04:04] okay but what I'm saying is is you know
[1:04:06] the God God don't give us gifts to hang
[1:04:08] them on the shelf for us to look at
[1:04:11] it God damn don't don't give us and you
[1:04:13] use it because we're giving things to be
[1:04:16] used
[1:04:17] to be used of God but also to utilize
[1:04:20] the things that we have
[1:04:23] because if God calls us to live in a
[1:04:25] place of heavenly places then they don't
[1:04:27] guess what that we live in Heavenly
[1:04:29] places and we utilize the things that
[1:04:31] are there
[1:04:35] but if we don't then you know what it
[1:04:36] doesn't do anybody any good
[1:04:40] it's just like people that that can sing
[1:04:44] and you know some people they can sing
[1:04:46] but you know what it's like pulling
[1:04:48] teeth trying to get people to sing
[1:04:51] but you know you know the people that
[1:04:53] are that are happy to get up and sing
[1:04:57] you know what I'm talking about
[1:05:00] and ain't calling any names
[1:05:02] but some folks couldn't carry a tune in
[1:05:04] a bucket
[1:05:06] but you know what the Bible says to make
[1:05:09] a Joyful Noise
[1:05:11] and you know what some people don't like
[1:05:13] like pops always said he said we're
[1:05:15] going to make we're going to be
[1:05:16] somewhere between a Joyful Noise and an
[1:05:18] awful racket
[1:05:20] but you know what some people they don't
[1:05:21] mind doing that
[1:05:26] but some people they can sing like a
[1:05:28] nightingale
[1:05:29] and you'd have you'd have to put
[1:05:30] dynamite in and blow it up for them to
[1:05:33] actually get them to move to sing for
[1:05:34] the Lord
[1:05:36] you know I told I told so many young
[1:05:39] people that I've talked to that I see
[1:05:41] that like our young people and the ones
[1:05:43] that don't want to have these wonderful
[1:05:44] gifts and everything like that I said
[1:05:46] they get up here and they say well I I
[1:05:47] may I make a mistake somebody listen
[1:05:49] there's 88 keys on that piano right
[1:05:53] right so there's 88 keys on that piano
[1:05:55] right there
[1:05:57] she she guesses she plays the piano she
[1:05:59] don't anyway right somebody somebody
[1:06:01] somewhere along that number I don't know
[1:06:02] what it is somebody knows I don't but I
[1:06:04] think that's how many okay you know I
[1:06:07] mean you know how many how many keys do
[1:06:08] you how many those things you hit at
[1:06:10] times sister Esther
[1:06:12] 10 11. 946
[1:06:16] whatever it is that you're hitting
[1:06:19] out of 88 and somebody's hitting it all
[1:06:21] of a sudden well I hit the wrong one how
[1:06:23] many people know that there was a wrong
[1:06:24] key hit
[1:06:30] and if you mess up just do like sister
[1:06:31] Esther doesn't
[1:06:33] fix everything
[1:06:35] I love that maybe nobody else in this
[1:06:39] church does but I I we listen we listen
[1:06:41] uh Sarah and I we're in the car and
[1:06:43] coming on Wednesday night we hear her
[1:06:45] playing the piano sometimes and man
[1:06:46] she's just going and I hear a rake at
[1:06:49] that piano man I tell them I say I tell
[1:06:52] him I said sister Esther's playing the
[1:06:54] piano
[1:06:55] I like if I don't do something for you I
[1:06:59] think your spoons fell out of your bowl
[1:07:02] so
[1:07:03] just do it for me if nobody else likes
[1:07:05] it sister Esther I like it
[1:07:07] but let me tell you what it does
[1:07:09] something for me but but I tell them I
[1:07:10] said listen I said you get up here and
[1:07:12] there's 88 keys and and how many how
[1:07:14] many string you got 10 strings on the on
[1:07:16] the mandolin right
[1:07:17] yeah
[1:07:19] okay listen there are six strings on the
[1:07:21] guitar I know that much I play that I
[1:07:24] don't know what everybody else knows but
[1:07:26] anyway
[1:07:27] somebody on somebody will know there's
[1:07:28] four there's four on the violin I know
[1:07:30] that much
[1:07:32] but you know I mean how many key I mean
[1:07:34] how many knows you see you're playing a
[1:07:35] song
[1:07:38] yeah 200 notes whatever and yeah how
[1:07:42] many people in here have a perfect pitch
[1:07:43] and and understand how you hit the wrong
[1:07:45] note I wouldn't
[1:07:48] but some people you know they'll play a
[1:07:50] song they'll get up here and play a song
[1:07:52] and they'll play and they can play for
[1:07:54] four minutes
[1:07:56] they'll play a song for four minutes and
[1:07:57] the only thing that they get out of that
[1:07:59] four minutes is I hit the wrong note
[1:08:02] yeah they don't get in the spirit of
[1:08:05] worship they get out of that one note
[1:08:09] and I tell kids I said listen you're not
[1:08:11] playing for the audience
[1:08:12] this is not a concert
[1:08:15] I said when you get up here and play
[1:08:16] you're playing for God you don't worry
[1:08:18] about whether whether you hit the wrong
[1:08:20] note or nothing then you learn you know
[1:08:22] what because a lot of y'all don't know
[1:08:23] how many mistakes I've made playing the
[1:08:25] guitar
[1:08:26] because most of you don't know how to
[1:08:27] play the guitar so you wouldn't know if
[1:08:28] I made it or not
[1:08:30] thank you
[1:08:31] Richard sometimes knows when I make a
[1:08:33] mistake but nobody else does
[1:08:37] but you know what it's playing for the
[1:08:38] glory of the Lord It's not trying to
[1:08:40] worry about whether whether we are yeah
[1:08:41] and it's good to practice but you know
[1:08:43] what when you get in this in the church
[1:08:45] it's a spirit of worship it's not
[1:08:48] worrying about trying to get every
[1:08:50] single note right and that's good but
[1:08:52] when you come to the house of God what
[1:08:54] are you trying to do are you trying to
[1:08:57] glorify God
[1:08:58] because a lot of times people will get
[1:09:00] and they get into this and they're
[1:09:02] saying and you'll see them they'll get
[1:09:03] up here it's like we're gonna want if
[1:09:05] you were in in your house
[1:09:07] if you were sitting in your house at the
[1:09:10] piano and you started to play the piano
[1:09:13] you've got zero pressure on you
[1:09:16] and you began to play the songs
[1:09:19] and all of a sudden you'll feel the
[1:09:21] presence of the Lord come and you and
[1:09:23] you'll begin to enter into a spirit of
[1:09:25] worship in your own house and the only
[1:09:27] person that's there is you and the Lord
[1:09:30] and I said you know what that's the same
[1:09:33] idea when you come to the house of God
[1:09:35] when you set down to play it's not just
[1:09:38] to be going through the motions but it's
[1:09:39] to bring a spirit of worship and then
[1:09:42] when you realize I'm glorifying God
[1:09:43] that's what God wants to see and I
[1:09:45] always tell young people listen don't
[1:09:47] when you get up here just play for the
[1:09:49] glory of God because God's the only one
[1:09:51] that matters
[1:09:53] probably even because you know
[1:09:55] everything that we ought to do is to be
[1:09:57] pleasing unto the Lord
[1:10:00] not just not just trying to do things
[1:10:02] because you know we're trying to impress
[1:10:04] somebody that doesn't do any good
[1:10:07] so when you come up here play play for
[1:10:09] the glory of the Lord sing for the glory
[1:10:11] of the Lord raise your hands
[1:10:15] and if you can't if you can't hold up
[1:10:17] one you know both hands just hold up one
[1:10:19] for a while and then swap to the other
[1:10:21] one
[1:10:24] and if your hands get tired just go like
[1:10:26] this
[1:10:29] window you're tired
[1:10:33] but it's okay raise your hand
[1:10:36] if you just swing your arm you put it
[1:10:37] back down
[1:10:42] right
[1:10:44] it's better than just sitting there
[1:10:46] looking like this
[1:10:50] I understand some people come in and and
[1:10:52] boy I tell you what them them
[1:10:55] pews they'll move on you
[1:10:57] because they're holding them down all
[1:10:59] the time
[1:10:59] [Laughter]
[1:11:03] thank you
[1:11:06] but you know when we come to the house
[1:11:07] of God you know
[1:11:10] I see I see people you know what they'll
[1:11:13] get out and they they can work and I I
[1:11:16] got I got guys that I work with friends
[1:11:17] and I tell you what they can get out and
[1:11:19] they can work in the yard they can I
[1:11:22] mean sweat just all kind of work but you
[1:11:25] know what they they can't uh
[1:11:27] don't set them down
[1:11:30] they're useless
[1:11:34] and you and it's like it's so amazing
[1:11:36] when you when you when you work I mean
[1:11:37] you can do but you can't come to the
[1:11:39] house of God and you can't raise your
[1:11:40] hands
[1:11:44] brother you can't clap your hands
[1:11:48] let's let's pull them engines apart and
[1:11:50] do all kinds of stuff but you know we
[1:11:51] come we all we ought to put we ought to
[1:11:53] put a little bit of emphasis on what
[1:11:55] we're doing when we get here
[1:11:57] [Applause]
[1:12:07] but sometimes you know we don't realize
[1:12:09] when we come here we just well
[1:12:12] we're just back in and doing the same
[1:12:14] thing no
[1:12:16] we're meeting with we're meeting with
[1:12:17] God
[1:12:19] he gave us he gave us his all he gave us
[1:12:21] our his best that we ought to give us
[1:12:24] give him our best and we ought to give
[1:12:26] him our all that we have
[1:12:32] no brother I'm speaking here
[1:12:35] in the in the message the leading of the
[1:12:37] spirit
[1:12:39] and
[1:12:40] he was speaking of the of the Magis
[1:12:44] and he says he said and they watched the
[1:12:47] stars in every city
[1:12:49] and not one of them ever saw it
[1:12:52] speaking to all the cities that when he
[1:12:55] when they were going
[1:12:57] everybody between there and Bethlehem
[1:13:00] nobody saw that star
[1:13:03] all the way to Jerusalem when they when
[1:13:05] they came
[1:13:06] to see here when I got to see here
[1:13:09] nobody saw that
[1:13:12] they come all that way
[1:13:14] and the Magis followed all the way from
[1:13:16] India Plum into Palestine
[1:13:19] why didn't they see it he said the
[1:13:21] reason people can't see the Glorious
[1:13:23] things of God today they're not looking
[1:13:25] for them that's the reason it's only
[1:13:27] given to those who are looking for it
[1:13:29] those major I had what had watched
[1:13:32] balaam's prophecy when he said there'll
[1:13:35] be a star rise out of Jacob they knew it
[1:13:37] and the way things were shaping up it
[1:13:39] was time for it to happen and you can
[1:13:43] tell amen
[1:13:44] he said but listen here here it is
[1:13:47] listen you can tell we're at the end of
[1:13:49] the road Atomic bonds Cobalt hydrogens
[1:13:52] the Nations it's trembling fussing the
[1:13:54] great enemy hanging Yonder with jet
[1:13:56] planes that could blow this nation to
[1:13:58] Pieces yes the whole world in five
[1:14:00] minutes time everybody's nervous
[1:14:04] well that was
[1:14:06] 1955. it's the same thing today in 2022
[1:14:11] but why but here here are those people
[1:14:14] they saw what the prophecy the Mage I
[1:14:16] saw what the prophecy was and brother
[1:14:18] Bob said how people didn't see the
[1:14:20] things of God is because they weren't
[1:14:21] looking for it
[1:14:23] but those people brother I've said they
[1:14:25] got up every single day and and every
[1:14:28] night they studied the stars and had
[1:14:31] wrote down everything that had happened
[1:14:33] all the changes I knew where every Star
[1:14:35] was supposed to be and what would take
[1:14:37] place and they knew by the by the
[1:14:40] writings by the prophecies what was
[1:14:41] going to take place so every time they
[1:14:43] got up there or looking they were
[1:14:44] looking to see what was anomaly what was
[1:14:47] something different
[1:14:49] when they saw that tight place and they
[1:14:51] saw that star rise up out of Jacob then
[1:14:53] they knew that was a prophecy to be
[1:14:55] fulfilled and they started heading that
[1:14:57] way
[1:14:59] and look like I was it caused a reaction
[1:15:01] because it moved them because they saw
[1:15:04] something
[1:15:06] well the same way if you had seen
[1:15:09] something and then it doesn't it doesn't
[1:15:11] move you then you really didn't see
[1:15:12] something
[1:15:14] he didn't change you
[1:15:17] because if if you see actually see
[1:15:19] something that it's a life-changing
[1:15:21] experience
[1:15:24] then you've got to move
[1:15:26] but people don't see those things
[1:15:34] brother I'm speaking
[1:15:36] he's speaking here in in the message the
[1:15:39] uncertain uh I'm sorry be certain of God
[1:15:41] and and he was speaking of Ahab and he
[1:15:44] was talking about the condition that the
[1:15:45] world had gotten into and right right
[1:15:48] before here brother Brown was speaking
[1:15:50] hey speaking of coming to God and and
[1:15:53] leaving God and and realizing where
[1:15:55] you've come to and where you where you
[1:15:57] are today and brother I'm speaking and
[1:16:00] he starts talking about the chaplain
[1:16:02] that come to the soldier and he asked
[1:16:04] the soldier when he was in there and he
[1:16:05] was laying dying on the ground and the
[1:16:07] chaplain come to him and he said son he
[1:16:09] said where did you leave God
[1:16:11] he began to talk to him about it and he
[1:16:13] kept looking back he said Son you don't
[1:16:15] have a lot of time
[1:16:16] he said Now's the Time to understand
[1:16:18] where you've left God he said you need
[1:16:20] to understand where have you left God
[1:16:22] where where was it and he said at that
[1:16:25] moment he said then he said he began to
[1:16:27] say now I lay me down to sleep well
[1:16:29] because he left God as a child and
[1:16:31] that's where he left God but he had to
[1:16:33] go right back to that place to find God
[1:16:35] where he left him and he said as he was
[1:16:37] laying there dying he began to pray and
[1:16:39] he said that's what then he slipped off
[1:16:41] because he'd come back to the place and
[1:16:43] he said you've got to know where you
[1:16:44] come to and he begins to talk about this
[1:16:47] the condition that we're in and he
[1:16:49] begins to talk about Ahab and he said
[1:16:52] all these things had long left Ahab why
[1:16:55] because Ahab but left God why because he
[1:16:58] got so wrapped up in his ancestral
[1:17:00] idolatry that they had gotten the Kings
[1:17:02] of Israel had gotten away from all of
[1:17:04] the precepts and all the laws of God
[1:17:07] that they had come to and that's exactly
[1:17:09] what they have done because he just
[1:17:11] walked in the in the way of his fathers
[1:17:14] now he had done all these things and he
[1:17:16] just said well I'm just doing what
[1:17:17] everybody else has done
[1:17:20] and all of a sudden he marries Jesse
[1:17:22] Bale
[1:17:23] and he gets all twisted up in that and
[1:17:25] then he he ends to talk about how
[1:17:27] Jezebel tried to put the uh come out
[1:17:30] there was twisted before Jay Hugh
[1:17:34] he said you know she got he said after
[1:17:36] her husband was dead she dressed herself
[1:17:38] and twisted out before jehu thought she
[1:17:41] could Vamp the the man of God and said
[1:17:43] throw her out the window he said if we
[1:17:46] had more men like jehu today we'd have
[1:17:48] less Jezebels but that was her nature
[1:17:50] and she was a worshiper of idolatry and
[1:17:54] she thought the whole and she brought
[1:17:55] the whole nation to idolatry and so has
[1:17:58] our modern Trends today falling from
[1:18:00] falling away from the things of God and
[1:18:03] has brought the world to one of the
[1:18:05] greatest idolatries that we have that's
[1:18:08] idleness just idling Away Great is the
[1:18:11] iniquity of the people today making
[1:18:13] plenty of money and think that God's
[1:18:14] blessing us because he's prospered us
[1:18:17] that's no sign of God's blessing not at
[1:18:19] all
[1:18:20] a lot so many people you know they get
[1:18:22] wrapped up in their own things but they
[1:18:24] they have this great Idol and it's
[1:18:26] idleness where they don't do anything
[1:18:30] now yeah well I go to work and I come
[1:18:32] home and I I out all these things but
[1:18:35] you know what they don't do anything for
[1:18:36] the house of God they don't do anything
[1:18:38] for a spiritual walk with God
[1:18:41] and great is this idolatry why because
[1:18:43] they well you know we're just doing
[1:18:44] we're just keeping up with the Joneses
[1:18:46] and and we're doing all these other
[1:18:47] things but they're not doing anything to
[1:18:49] put anything toward having a spiritual
[1:18:51] walk with God
[1:18:54] and so they've they've missed out all
[1:18:55] these things because they've not
[1:18:57] continued on with what God has called
[1:18:59] them to God's speaking to them and then
[1:19:02] he then it's this is from the message
[1:19:04] here again brother I'm says he said
[1:19:05] speaking of the tutor and he's speaking
[1:19:07] of the Holy Ghost he said now the tutor
[1:19:09] had to report to the father all that the
[1:19:11] child did whether it was good or bad the
[1:19:14] tutor had to give a correct report and
[1:19:16] the father seen that it was his tutor
[1:19:18] would be a little wishy-washy sort of a
[1:19:21] guy and his son would be doing wrong
[1:19:23] he'd be afraid before the father to say
[1:19:25] that his son was doing wrong he had to
[1:19:28] be the right kind of tutor a real just
[1:19:30] and honest man he looked for that type
[1:19:33] of person to put over his child and it's
[1:19:36] all together a beautiful type of God our
[1:19:38] Father sending to us the church the
[1:19:40] Tudor the razor the Holy Spirit God
[1:19:42] found the best tutor that there was in
[1:19:45] heaven to put over his church the Holy
[1:19:46] Spirit not some intellectual being
[1:19:48] that's just got a lot of Education more
[1:19:50] than they got a lot of Education to know
[1:19:52] how to control it
[1:19:54] and the charge was not to be raised on
[1:19:57] intellectuals not but it was to be
[1:19:59] tutored not by denomination but it was
[1:20:02] to be tutored by the Holy Spirit that's
[1:20:04] God's tutor and what do you think that
[1:20:07] the tutor would do
[1:20:08] to come before the father and have to
[1:20:11] tell him how his children was
[1:20:12] progressing I sometimes wonder how the
[1:20:15] Holy Spirit must spill to go to the
[1:20:17] presence of God with the character of
[1:20:18] his children today who we who call
[1:20:22] ourselves Sons and Daughters of God how
[1:20:24] he must like the prophet of gold blush
[1:20:27] in the presence of God how the church
[1:20:29] has become so indignant about the things
[1:20:32] of God how they go off on little
[1:20:34] tantrums and don't even notice the word
[1:20:36] of God remember the Holy Spirit Will
[1:20:38] tutor the children by the direction of
[1:20:41] the book of the father that's the word
[1:20:42] God will raise his church by the word
[1:20:44] and the Holy Spirit will teach the
[1:20:46] church the word not the catechism not
[1:20:49] the roles of the church but the power of
[1:20:50] the word of the Living God the holy
[1:20:53] spirit will give that to the church did
[1:20:55] not our blessed Lord say man shall I
[1:20:57] live by bread alone but by every word
[1:20:59] the proceedeth thou the mouth of God
[1:21:00] that's the thing the holy spirit will
[1:21:02] teach and when the Holy Spirit teaches
[1:21:04] unadulterated Holiness before the Lord
[1:21:06] how do you think the Holy Spirit deals
[1:21:09] to bring the word before the father that
[1:21:11] were selfish that were unconcerned will
[1:21:14] stay home on prayer meeting nights to
[1:21:16] watch the old religious programs
[1:21:18] uncensored with dirty jokes and
[1:21:20] everything and then calling ourselves
[1:21:21] the Church of the Living God what do you
[1:21:24] think he thinks tonight
[1:21:29] amen
[1:21:35] can you imagine the Holy Ghost
[1:21:37] having to look at people's lives and
[1:21:39] understand that he has to give an
[1:21:41] account to tell the Lord what what the
[1:21:44] people are because you know he said when
[1:21:45] they was a tutor when a man had a son he
[1:21:48] wanted to raise him up he gave him the
[1:21:49] best kind of tutor will he give us the
[1:21:51] the best the Holy Ghost but he came to
[1:21:53] raises but you know what you don't have
[1:21:55] to follow the Holy Ghost
[1:21:57] the Holy Ghost gives you the way to go
[1:21:59] but you know what it's up to you to
[1:22:00] follow him
[1:22:01] and you don't and you don't have to
[1:22:03] follow it
[1:22:05] but you know what just remember when you
[1:22:07] decide hey I'm not going to follow the
[1:22:09] holy ghost or I'm going to do my own
[1:22:10] thing or it's okay to do this or
[1:22:12] whatever you know we get we get a little
[1:22:14] bit lags on everything just remember
[1:22:15] you're gonna pay for it
[1:22:17] there's always there's always a pavement
[1:22:19] that's got to be made
[1:22:22] he said listen he said you know we're
[1:22:24] taught by the word of God to be raised
[1:22:26] by the word of God and he said how can
[1:22:27] how can the spirit and the the Holy
[1:22:30] Spirit he said when he says that we're
[1:22:32] selfish and we're unconcerned
[1:22:35] when we're selfish why because you know
[1:22:37] the Life of Christ is not a selfish life
[1:22:39] you can't live you can't be selfish and
[1:22:42] Live the Life of Christ
[1:22:45] because when when Christ came then he
[1:22:47] you know everything he said he said I
[1:22:49] don't do anything the son can do nothing
[1:22:52] in himself except what he sees the
[1:22:54] father do they do what the son likewise
[1:22:59] well you know that'd be kind of hard
[1:23:01] sometimes if we sat down and we started
[1:23:03] looking at the way we live our life
[1:23:04] sometimes the way we speak to our
[1:23:06] children the way we speak to our wives
[1:23:08] the way we speak to our boss sometimes
[1:23:10] the way people wait till we react the
[1:23:12] way people say things to us and say how
[1:23:14] how's that pleasing to the Lord would
[1:23:16] the Lord do that
[1:23:19] would that be the what and then it's
[1:23:20] like you know something well I don't I
[1:23:22] don't want to I don't you know I I just
[1:23:24] gonna do and do my little part no
[1:23:26] sometimes when God calls you to do more
[1:23:28] people don't want to respond to that
[1:23:30] well I don't want to get out of my
[1:23:32] comfort zone I'm I'm okay over here no
[1:23:34] God calls you and sometimes he wants you
[1:23:36] to get up it's like well why am I going
[1:23:38] that way well it's just like Abraham
[1:23:39] when God called Abraham God called
[1:23:41] Abraham up and said listen I want you to
[1:23:43] leave your family he said I want to want
[1:23:45] you to follow me come out here go to a
[1:23:47] place that you've never been before I
[1:23:49] want to show you take you to a place
[1:23:53] he's like well I don't know where I'm
[1:23:54] going well guess what you just follow me
[1:23:56] because I'm gonna lead you
[1:23:58] and they started out walking and all of
[1:24:00] a sudden he couldn't even he couldn't
[1:24:01] even follow the directions that God gave
[1:24:03] him to begin with because he had to take
[1:24:05] lot with him and God didn't tell him
[1:24:06] take Lord told him go himself you got to
[1:24:09] separate from your family and what
[1:24:11] happened it let he went on down the road
[1:24:13] and after so long then he had a had to
[1:24:15] blow up with with lot and all of a
[1:24:17] sudden they had all the herdsmen were
[1:24:19] fighting and they had to split up why
[1:24:20] because it wasn't for Abraham to be
[1:24:23] there he had to get had to separate from
[1:24:25] what God calling him out his own way
[1:24:29] so when God calls it he's got a way for
[1:24:31] us to go sometimes you know we don't
[1:24:33] understand why we have to go certain
[1:24:34] ways but that's what God has us to have
[1:24:36] faith you got to have faith in what
[1:24:38] God's doing and not realizing that you
[1:24:40] know
[1:24:41] I I used to drive I used to drive me
[1:24:44] crazy when I was when when the boys were
[1:24:46] little because you know they they played
[1:24:48] 20 questions and as soon as you get to
[1:24:49] 20 questions I got 20 more questions I
[1:24:51] want you to answer
[1:24:52] they're always questioning everything
[1:24:54] and it's like listen it's not for you to
[1:24:56] know just do what you're told
[1:25:01] when you
[1:25:03] get there
[1:25:05] we got things to do besides us standing
[1:25:08] here answering all your questions
[1:25:10] just do what you're told
[1:25:14] because you know what they want to have
[1:25:16] the answer before they do something
[1:25:18] well God sometimes we want to we want
[1:25:20] God to give us the answer before we do
[1:25:22] something and God's trying to tell us
[1:25:23] you just need to walk by faith you just
[1:25:26] need to walk forward don't keep asking
[1:25:28] questions about well why while Lord I'm
[1:25:30] just going to put it in your hands and
[1:25:31] realize you're going to take control of
[1:25:33] it so I can just walk
[1:25:34] I'm just going to continue to walk
[1:25:36] forward because that's the best thing
[1:25:38] for me to do
[1:25:43] brother Brown says he said now
[1:25:49] he said no every
[1:25:52] person thinks of their children this is
[1:25:54] from message the way to have Fellowship
[1:25:56] he said now every person thinks of their
[1:25:57] children
[1:25:58] he said while they're under your wings
[1:26:00] you watch them but once out from under
[1:26:02] the wings then the devil's got every
[1:26:04] little Oscar he can out there to
[1:26:07] associate with your children that's
[1:26:08] infidelic I mean the evolution
[1:26:10] everything else God help us the juvenile
[1:26:12] delinquency here in New York Chicago and
[1:26:14] all these big cities once the papers is
[1:26:16] writing up how they kill one another and
[1:26:18] everything the little children little
[1:26:19] boys girls killing and murdering
[1:26:21] shooting and so forth like that if those
[1:26:24] poor little kitties only realize that
[1:26:26] that's the devil sure
[1:26:28] he said what brought on juvenile
[1:26:30] delinquency was parent delinquency the
[1:26:33] parent failing to take care of their
[1:26:35] children
[1:26:36] he said continue his own he says
[1:26:38] he said I remember the doctor told my
[1:26:40] wife said just let that kid squall
[1:26:45] said it ain't gonna hurt him
[1:26:47] and if his grandma comes along to pick
[1:26:49] him up and take it take
[1:26:51] her hands off of him he ought to be crib
[1:26:54] broke at six months he says now you know
[1:26:57] better than that
[1:26:59] sounds like a talking of a witch doctor
[1:27:02] instead of a real doctor
[1:27:04] and then you know what it hatched out
[1:27:07] it hatched out a bunch of neurotics and
[1:27:10] a bunch of gangsters listen God gave you
[1:27:12] that child of love I don't care how bad
[1:27:14] you spoil it love it anyhow that's right
[1:27:17] love it if you don't love it now it'll
[1:27:20] grow up in a cold home and indifferent
[1:27:22] and it'll seek love somewhere else or
[1:27:24] something it'll be out an out light for
[1:27:27] some for somewhere mother take that baby
[1:27:30] and give it fellowship and love now make
[1:27:32] it a part of you which it is act like it
[1:27:35] and hug it and kiss it and love it don't
[1:27:37] be too cold with the things of the world
[1:27:39] God gave you that as a treasure raise it
[1:27:42] right amen notice that's what's the
[1:27:45] matter we got away from the things of
[1:27:47] God you get away from nature then you're
[1:27:50] out of the will of God
[1:27:53] you know you know many times because
[1:27:55] people you know they have all of these
[1:27:57] books and all these self-help books and
[1:28:00] you know it's so funny because you know
[1:28:01] people have spent millions of dollars
[1:28:03] buying books and all these people Dr
[1:28:05] Spock and all these other ones that have
[1:28:08] written books Dr Dobson and everybody
[1:28:10] else trying to teach you how to raise
[1:28:12] your kids
[1:28:13] and you know and you know everybody's
[1:28:15] got everybody's got to write a book and
[1:28:16] put it out and it's it's Dr this and
[1:28:19] doctor that and it's like you know and
[1:28:21] sometimes when you get down and you
[1:28:22] start studying what they got it's I mean
[1:28:24] Dr Seuss is a better is a better book
[1:28:27] than some of these doctor books and Dr
[1:28:30] Pepper is better than some of these
[1:28:32] books but I mean but people people put
[1:28:34] all of their of their life into these
[1:28:37] books that this is going to help them
[1:28:38] raise children but the problem is is God
[1:28:41] give us a book on how to raise children
[1:28:43] but the problem is is people don't
[1:28:45] realize that it's a book to raise
[1:28:46] children
[1:28:48] that's right hey God give us a way to
[1:28:50] raise children and he said we get away
[1:28:51] from the things of God he said then
[1:28:53] we're out of the will of God why because
[1:28:55] we don't look where God tells us to look
[1:28:57] what God has given us a way to raise
[1:28:59] kids
[1:29:02] and somebody you know and you know it's
[1:29:04] like all the time back you know it was
[1:29:06] always well you know
[1:29:08] um they they didn't want they didn't
[1:29:10] want
[1:29:10] uh mothers breastfeeding because they
[1:29:13] come up with formula and it was so much
[1:29:14] better and when they were trying to sell
[1:29:16] all this and then coming to find out you
[1:29:18] know what what God made was better than
[1:29:20] what God what man made
[1:29:23] amen all right
[1:29:25] amazing how that God created something
[1:29:28] and a man tried to spend years there
[1:29:30] trying to make something trying to
[1:29:32] doctor something up to sell to people
[1:29:34] and come to find out what God done in
[1:29:36] the beginning was the best
[1:29:39] hey people well that's shocking
[1:29:43] but that's what people done they trying
[1:29:45] to find a better way to do something not
[1:29:47] realize that God's already made the
[1:29:49] perfect way God has the most perfect way
[1:29:52] and you're not going to be able to find
[1:29:53] a better way than the way God made it
[1:29:56] great
[1:30:03] this is from
[1:30:04] return in Jubilee

[1:30:36] an old rugged Backwoods preacher that'll
[1:30:38] come with a pair of overalls on and hit
[1:30:41] the pulpit Hallelujah Anointed with the
[1:30:43] power of God

[1:30:53] won't Peck around on the Barnyard stuff
[1:30:56] they'll go up into the heavenlies for
[1:30:58] their food

[1:35:29] this is this is the this is from as the
[1:35:32] eagle stirs her nest and he was speaking

[1:37:18] feet off the ground and then just go to
[1:37:21] flapping them little wings of yours just
[1:37:24] flap them as hard as you can you can
[1:37:26] rise cause you're an eagle see you've
[1:37:29] got long feathers fly just jump off the
[1:37:31] ground and start flapping your wings
[1:37:33] real hard I'll get you he jumped up this
[1:37:36] little Eagle coming up coming out of
[1:37:38] them denominations and give a little
[1:37:40] great big flap four or five times and
[1:37:43] let right on a barnyard post right in
[1:37:46] the middle of a Pentecostal denomination
[1:37:48] he said you can't pen you can't
[1:37:50] denominate Pentecost and all that
[1:37:54] all denominations
[1:37:56] he said mother come by here and said
[1:37:58] mama ain't not doing good look there I
[1:38:01] am now mama she said Sonny you're going
[1:38:04] to have to jump higher than that or I
[1:38:06] can't get you there she stooped down
[1:38:09] again she he throwed his little feet up
[1:38:11] in the air and began to flop his wings
[1:38:13] as hard as he could and the first thing
[1:38:16] you know he felt something being lifted
[1:38:18] up up till he struck the milky white way
[1:38:22] amen then he could fly himself after he
[1:38:24] got high enough he could fly himself
[1:38:26] brother that's what the matter with the
[1:38:28] church today it's never raised up high
[1:38:31] enough just to get out of an
[1:38:33] organization it or or something another
[1:38:36] to find out whether it could fly or not
[1:38:39] how do you know you can't fly
[1:38:42] use your wings
[1:38:44] Hallelujah jump into it go to flapping
[1:38:48] your wings and find out Jehovah will
[1:38:49] catch you I will bear You Up On Eagle's
[1:38:52] Wings amen
[1:38:54] and so I want to say to you tonight how
[1:38:56] do you know that you can't fly have you
[1:38:59] jump have you tried have you flapped
[1:39:01] your wings another thing is is don't
[1:39:03] just try it a few times but keep
[1:39:04] flapping your wings as hard as you can
[1:39:06] and whatever the battle is you just
[1:39:09] press on as hard as you can not just go
[1:39:11] halfway but continue to press the button
[1:39:14] why because God is wanting us to build
[1:39:16] up a house that he can be glorified in
[1:39:18] and that's what we are to do we are
[1:39:21] supposed to be the end the moving living
[1:39:23] instrumentality of Jesus Christ set your
[1:39:26] wings and fly yeah why because the wind
[1:39:28] of the holy spirit is moving but are you
[1:39:31] going to set your wings and fly
[1:39:34] how do I tell you something about
[1:39:35] sisters I have I had a I've had a moving
[1:39:39] tonight and it stirred me I will I want
[1:39:41] to see a movie that we've never seen
[1:39:43] before in this church I want to say a
[1:39:45] moving of the Holy Spirit I want to see
[1:39:47] things happen that's never happened
[1:39:48] before I want to see uh the word open up
[1:39:52] like it's never opened up before
[1:39:56] why because because the world is getting
[1:39:58] in a worse condition everything's
[1:40:00] starting to fall apart everything's
[1:40:02] going down but you know what the word of
[1:40:03] God is getting greater and greater and
[1:40:05] greater God has continued to call us up
[1:40:07] higher
[1:40:09] God bless you tonight amen let's sing us
[1:40:12] home

[1:41:06] uh I'll come up Sunday request a prayer
[1:41:08] for my uh black manager
[1:41:11] well they had him in a Coleman you know
[1:41:13] and uh they brought him out of it they
[1:41:16] didn't know what to expect so uh he
[1:41:18] immediately recognized his family people
[1:41:22] started interacting with him so uh we'll
[1:41:26] keep praying for that you know and uh
[1:41:29] also want to come up here I come after
[1:41:32] uh a prayer one prayer cloth and Wade
[1:41:35] said I'm gonna give you two
[1:41:38] well since then I've learned that
[1:41:40] there's a supervisor down there his wife
[1:41:41] has had open heart surgery
[1:41:43] and she's been in the hospital some two
[1:41:46] weeks now complications so wait I think
[1:41:48] I know where the second prayer cloth is
[1:41:50] going to go
[1:41:51] and then uh several months ago
[1:41:55] uh I came up requested prayer and got a
[1:41:58] prayer cloth for trucker buddy of mine
[1:42:00] he's out in Oklahoma Arkansas Area out
[1:42:02] there and I don't see him all the time
[1:42:04] and when he does come in we don't get to
[1:42:06] talk all the time or every time
[1:42:08] so uh I looked up here come today
[1:42:12] and he looked like he was a
[1:42:14] they're like had something he just had
[1:42:16] to tell me
[1:42:17] so we said our quick hellos and he
[1:42:19] started talking and uh the prayer
[1:42:22] request several months ago was for his
[1:42:23] sister-in-law
[1:42:25] had had cancer just it was bad
[1:42:29] and he told me today he said
[1:42:31] you tell your church
[1:42:33] thank you
[1:42:34] she's cancer-free
[1:42:43] I believe that these prayer claws are
[1:42:46] more than some Hocus Pocus or some good
[1:42:48] luck charm
[1:42:50] if it is a good luck charm it's the best
[1:42:52] one you're ever going to have
[1:42:54] but anyway I thought I'd come up and
[1:42:56] share with you I told him I'd tell y'all
