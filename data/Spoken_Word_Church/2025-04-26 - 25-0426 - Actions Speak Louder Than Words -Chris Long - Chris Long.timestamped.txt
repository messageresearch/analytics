[0:00] seems so strange. And all right, but I
[0:03] appreciate the Lord. He's given me a
[0:05] good long life so far. Yes, sir. There
[0:08] was a I'm the oldest of the kids that my
[0:11] daddy and mama had, and there ain't but
[0:14] one living and she's the youngest. So,
[0:17] God's been good to us. Amen. And I
[0:20] appreciate him calling me when he did.
[0:24] You know, it's strange that I never
[0:26] dreamed I was fixing to get saved when I
[0:29] did. Uh my wife come down with three
[0:32] little boys dressed up going to church
[0:34] one Saturday and I said, "Uh, if you
[0:37] wait, I'll get ready to go." Amen.
[0:40] Hallelujah.
[0:41] Well, I
[0:43] went sitt there on the bench. There's a
[0:46] woman preacher down at the hen house.
[0:50] All right. at Trinity Church where all
[0:53] my people was
[0:54] going. And as a woman got up and tried
[0:56] to preach, Brother Wade, and she
[0:58] complained about having a house full of
[1:00] kids and had to go preach. Mhm. She read
[1:04] one scripture. I couldn't tell you what
[1:05] it was. Right. Right. I sit right there
[1:07] and the baby we had, Tracy. He was a
[1:10] baby at that time. And when church is
[1:12] over, I never dreamed I smoke my last
[1:14] cigarette out there in my car that
[1:16] night. Amen. I ain't I ain't had one in
[1:19] my mouth since. Yeah.
[1:21] But I went to the altar that night.
[1:25] I mean, nobody begged me to go. I went.
[1:28] There you go. And there's some people
[1:30] that had the Holy Ghost. Amen. They
[1:33] might not know everything that I know or
[1:35] have come up like I do. You been one
[1:37] God. That's right. But they had the
[1:40] spirit of the Lord on them and they
[1:41] helped pray me through. I tried to but
[1:45] took a little more than that. I went
[1:46] about 3 months and about decided I have
[1:48] to come a baptism.
[1:51] I repented and I couldn't get the Holy
[1:53] Ghost.
[1:54] But I was on the right track. Yes, sir.
[1:56] You were. I repented. Next day I got
[1:58] baptized in Jesus name. Water. Yes. And
[2:02] the Bible said do that. Yes, it did.
[2:04] Well, I just kept holding out and sure
[2:06] enough, one night I went down there
[2:08] again and went up. The Lord spoke to me
[2:12] and things ain't been the same since.
[2:14] Come on. Amen.
[2:17] But I was supposed to not up here taking
[2:20] your time. I I just appreciate brother
[2:22] way inviting us down. Amen. Let's all
[2:25] bow our head. We'll pray. Heavenly
[2:28] Father, we thank you, Lord, for this
[2:30] time of
[2:31] fellowship. Lord, we know that you
[2:33] believe in that. Yes. Our prophet taught
[2:36] us that. Yes. And Lord, we know we come
[2:40] together for one purpose.
[2:43] That's to worship you, Lord. Amen. Yes
[2:45] sir. And Lord, we know that's needful in
[2:48] the day we live
[2:49] in. Or you told Nicodemus when he
[2:53] recognized the God gift of God being
[2:55] with
[2:56] you said no man could do the things you
[2:59] do unless God be with him. Amen. But you
[3:02] told him, Lord, man had to be born
[3:05] again.
[3:06] And Lord, we're thankful for that that
[3:09] we got born again.
[3:12] The Bible said in Acts 4:12, "There's no
[3:15] other name given under heaven," Amen.
[3:18] except the name of Jesus Christ.

[25:44] together, shall we? And of course, I am
[25:46] still uh I've been ministering on the
[25:49] resurrection, of course, moving on up to
[25:51] Easter, which was last weekend or and of
[25:54] course I know that it's the anniversary
[25:56] of the resurrection of the Lord. But
[25:58] every day, Amen.
[26:01] Every day you get up, you are testifying
[26:04] of the resurrection of the Lord. Amen.
[26:07] So, I don't think there's any reason for
[26:09] us to stop
[26:11] because brother Brandham says some
[26:13] profound things to us about that
[26:15] resurrection. And I'll quote two of them
[26:17] to you. One, the resurrection lays
[26:20] within you. Amen. Two, you have the
[26:22] power to lay your life down and to raise
[26:24] it up again. But it's got to be him and
[26:26] you doing it. It cannot be you yourself.
[26:30] We can barely get out of bed. Amen. Let
[26:32] alone raise oursel from the dead. Amen.
[26:36] Romans 8:11 if you would.
[26:40] This is very familiar scripture to all
[26:42] of us. Of course, uh they asked me for a
[26:44] title and I got it written down here. Uh
[26:46] actions speak louder than words. Amen.
[26:49] Now, there's a catch in there and you
[26:50] just haven't you just haven't thought
[26:52] about it yet. Actions have a voice.
[26:55] Yeah. Because they speak. They do. And
[26:57] that's the reason why we are here this
[26:59] evening. Amen. So, let me find myself
[27:02] over in Roman somewhere.
[27:05] Amen. I'm glad it's here in these pages
[27:07] or I might not find it. Amen. Amen. But
[27:10] I know the scripture and I love it. And
[27:14] Romans says, oops.
[27:18] But if the spirit of
[27:20] him that raised up Jesus from the dead
[27:24] dwell in you, he that raised up Christ
[27:27] from the dead shall also quicken your
[27:30] mortal bodies by his spirit that
[27:33] dwelleth. Yes, in you. Let's pray.
[27:35] Father, wonderful, wonderful portion of
[27:38] scripture, Lord, we're relying on you
[27:42] now, Father, to come down and speak to
[27:44] us, Father, through the agency of your
[27:46] Holy Spirit, who is the author of this
[27:49] very word that we have just written.
[27:51] Father, we love you and we thank you and
[27:53] we ask for your help now. We ask,
[27:56] Father, that you'd allow me to move out
[27:58] of the way. Yeah. Father, that you'd use
[28:00] me, Father, as a vessel, Father, in
[28:03] conjunction with the carrier of your
[28:05] word. And God, that the hearers here and
[28:09] abroad, Lord, would have their ears
[28:11] tuned, Amen. and attentive, Father, to
[28:14] what you have to say to us in this very
[28:18] hour. We give you all the honor, the
[28:20] glory, and the praise in the wonderful
[28:22] name of Jesus Christ. Amen. God bless
[28:25] you. You may be seated.
[28:27] Now, I know that seems like an odd title
[28:30] maybe to the thoughts that I'm going to
[28:32] start out with. Um, but but it's just
[28:35] been
[28:36] uh Thank you. I don't need that thing. I
[28:39] wouldn't know how to use it anyway. But
[28:41] maybe Wade can teach me.
[28:45] All right. But really, my thoughts are
[28:48] on something that um that will that will
[28:51] work its way into that title. And that
[28:53] is of course
[28:55] uh been studying the restoration of the
[28:58] bride tree. Been been looking into that
[29:00] and and of course the resurrection as we
[29:03] preached last Sunday at our Easter
[29:05] service is my interest is not not just
[29:10] solely focused of course on the
[29:13] resurrection that took place 2,000 years
[29:16] ago. But that resurrection preceded
[29:18] another. That's why I read Romans 8:11
[29:21] to you. It appears as though there is
[29:24] more than one resurrection. Is that
[29:27] right? Now, if you read your Bible, you
[29:28] find out that there is more than one
[29:31] resurrection.
[29:33] But somebody had to pave the way.
[29:36] Somebody had to break the mold. Somebody
[29:39] had to take death, hell, and the grave
[29:42] and conquer it. Amen. Now, we know that
[29:45] that was God himself in the form of a
[29:48] man. Amen. Amen. Uh as as we were
[29:51] traveling here from from Phoenix to
[29:54] Atlanta and then driving up here, I was
[29:57] in the airplane and and uh in the row in
[30:00] front of me where it was a packed
[30:02] plane, no seats available hardly at all.
[30:06] And there was three people in front of
[30:07] me uh that in this in the row in front
[30:10] of me that had never met before, but
[30:12] they began a conversation. Now that's a
[30:15] threeh hour and 35 minute flight. And
[30:17] they started in on each other and they
[30:20] were going at it for three hours and 30
[30:23] minutes. Amen.
[30:26] And when we got landed in Atlanta and
[30:29] everybody's getting up and the guy
[30:31] behind me is like, "Woo, those woo." And
[30:33] the guy over here is like, "Man, those
[30:35] because they were talking about the
[30:37] election. They were talking about
[30:39] Genesis. They were talking about
[30:41] Revelations. They were talking about
[30:42] they talked about everything in the
[30:45] spectrum." Yeah. And of course, my wife
[30:48] was another row over and back, and she
[30:50] could hear one of them talking quite
[30:52] loudly, a a Jewish man. They I'm
[30:55] surprised the fight didn't break out in
[30:56] the airplane because they were talking
[30:58] about their support of Israel. Yeah.
[31:00] Okay. You can imagine on a in a mixed
[31:03] audience, in a mixed crowd, you would
[31:04] have people that were would be just as
[31:07] bold against it. We see it. But brothers
[31:10] and sisters, all of those things are not
[31:12] really my interest. Yeah, as they got to
[31:15] the part about Israel and of course they
[31:17] talked about the pope and we all know
[31:19] that last Monday the pope passed away
[31:22] and there's going to be another one. And
[31:24] of course on Wednesday night I I brought
[31:26] out the the the the quotation that
[31:29] brother Brandham mentions about in Acts
[31:31] of the Holy Spirit uh a pope being
[31:34] brought watch how he says it now being
[31:35] brought out of the United States.
[31:38] Doesn't necessarily have to be a
[31:39] citizen. No. What you may or may not be
[31:42] aware of is many of the world leaders,
[31:45] many of the politicians in this world,
[31:48] many of the chics in the Middle East,
[31:50] the richest people in the world
[31:52] supposedly, many of the drug cartel.
[31:56] Yes. Captains.
[31:59] And many of the religious leaders have
[32:01] gotten their
[32:02] education in this nation. Absolutely,
[32:05] brother. Amen. Did you know that? Yes,
[32:08] sir.
[32:09] rulers, who are ruling powerful nations
[32:14] got their education here. So when you
[32:16] see the prophet saying brought out of
[32:18] the United States, we're all focusing on
[32:20] who's the guy. Right. Amen.
[32:23] Amen. It goes deeper than that. See, as
[32:25] brother Wade and I were talking, a
[32:27] prophet can see things that that that
[32:29] that are far far beyond. And even the
[32:34] prophet doesn't always know why or
[32:37] exactly what he's saying it for. He sees
[32:40] a picture. He see he can see over the
[32:42] mountain tops and he can see past the
[32:44] horizon. And he and he's made that way.
[32:46] He doesn't do it on purpose. As a matter
[32:48] of fact, he really can't operate it the
[32:51] way you and I think that it can be
[32:53] operated. It just happens because that's
[32:56] a vessel God chose. right now. I believe
[33:00] in the same sense God chose you and I to
[33:05] be a vessel maybe not to broadcast what
[33:08] is seen beyond the horizon, but to be on
[33:11] the other side of that horizon and to
[33:13] receive it. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah.
[33:16] Because what good would a broadcast do
[33:18] if nobody was going to listen? Right.
[33:20] Amen. What good would it do to prophesy
[33:24] if there was nothing to ever bring it to
[33:26] pass? Right. Amen. Okay, brother. So now
[33:30] I'm speaking about resurrection.
[33:34] And how
[33:35] that we
[33:37] believe, I believe, I believe you're
[33:40] here because you believe
[33:42] that Jesus Christ, the son of God, rose
[33:45] from the dead.
[33:47] Or we're of men most miserable and we
[33:50] are wasting our time. Amen. Right. And I
[33:53] don't believe there's anybody in here
[33:54] who thinks that they should be wasting
[33:57] their time. Come on, brother. All right.
[34:00] So, I began to see something that's very
[34:03] common to everybody of of course. So,
[34:05] I'm going to start out today with with
[34:08] this
[34:10] thought. There are two trees.
[34:13] Amen. Amen. Right. There are only two
[34:17] trees. Amen. Oh, no, brother. We got the
[34:19] maples and we got the this and we got
[34:21] that. I'm not talking about those trees.
[34:23] Come on, brother. I'm talking about the
[34:25] two trees that started this all off.
[34:28] Amen. Now, can we do the Can we Can we
[34:31] do a a Bible study? Yeah, sure. Amen.
[34:34] You all know these things, but turn to
[34:36] Genesis, would you? I Genesis chapter 2.
[34:42] Because my prayer, brothers and sisters,
[34:43] isn't that brother Chris Long gets up
[34:46] here and preaches to you a message
[34:48] that's pleasant to your ears. Yeah. It's
[34:51] that God would use me as his tool in his
[34:53] hand to provoke you to draw closer to
[34:57] him. That is my interest. And as you
[35:01] draw closer to him under this
[35:03] provocation, I'm in it with you. Yeah.
[35:06] Amen. I I want the floodgates to open.
[35:09] And I want us all to be washed in
[35:13] by the blood. Amen. So Genesis 2 verse
[35:18] 9, we could do verse eight. And the Lord
[35:20] God planted a garden eastward in Eden.
[35:23] And there he put the man whom he had
[35:25] formed. And out of the ground made the
[35:28] Lord God to grow every tree that is
[35:30] pleasant to the sight and good for food.
[35:34] So this tree has a compound purpose.
[35:36] Amen.
[35:37] the tree of life also in the midst of
[35:39] the garden and the tree of knowledge of
[35:42] good and evil. Amen. And then of course
[35:44] it goes on to talk about the rivers that
[35:46] go out of the garden. And verse 15, drop
[35:49] down there and it said, "And the Lord
[35:51] God took the man and put him into the
[35:54] garden of Eden to dress it and to keep
[35:56] it." Yes. So I got here written in my
[35:59] notes that wait a minute now. Adam was
[36:01] not born
[36:03] in the garden.
[36:05] Amen. Right. He was put there.
[36:10] All right. Now, God has a plan. Amen.
[36:12] We're going to read about it in a
[36:13] minute. He's got a plan. And I believe
[36:17] the more you involve yourself personally
[36:21] in the plan of God, the more the plan of
[36:23] God begins to open up to you and you
[36:26] come to an understanding of it. Now, I
[36:29] know there's places in the scripture and
[36:32] in the message, and I believe them just
[36:33] as much as the other side of it. You
[36:35] don't have to understand anything to
[36:38] begin this walk, but as you walk, you
[36:42] begin to come to an understanding of why
[36:45] you're walking. Amen. Amen. Okay. Amen.
[36:48] So, it's a two-edged sword. No, you
[36:51] don't have to understand it. But yes, if
[36:54] you get on the one edge of the same
[36:56] sword, you'll begin to go down to the
[36:58] point and rise up and turn back and
[37:01] begin to understand why you're on the
[37:03] other edge. Amen.
[37:05] Okay. So, we we these things are
[37:07] important. Why? Because the devil is
[37:09] spending all his time working you and I
[37:12] over. Amen.
[37:16] Nonstop 24/7. You can get on that
[37:19] internet all day and all night. Right.
[37:22] Amen. I'm using that as an example. Of
[37:24] course. Amen. Right. It's a dangerous
[37:27] tool. Yeah.
[37:29] Yes. It has some positive usefulness.
[37:34] Yes. But it's like
[37:36] saying people kill people. Guns don't
[37:39] kill people.
[37:42] Very rarely does a gun go off by itself.
[37:45] It could happen, but very rarely. That's
[37:49] right. And if it could happen, very
[37:52] rarely does it hit its target. That's
[37:54] right.
[37:55] It takes it takes an intelligence behind
[38:00] it. Amen. That's right. Right. Now,
[38:03] saying those things, I want you to
[38:05] realize that the same
[38:09] intelligence that put these scriptures
[38:12] in place that we just read and permitted
[38:15] there to be two trees. Absolutely. Amen.
[38:18] Think about the prophet of God talking
[38:21] with a man on his front porch.
[38:25] The man's an agnostic or an atheist or
[38:28] whatever his title was. walked around
[38:31] the countryside there for 60 or 70 years
[38:34] and never seen God. Y
[38:38] Well, he was looking for God in all the
[38:40] wrong places. That's right. Okay. And
[38:43] the prophet of God feels
[38:46] inspired. Perhaps he saw a vision, but
[38:49] he felt inspired to begin to say, "Now,
[38:52] let's take this tree for Can I have one
[38:53] of them apples off that tree?" Now, you
[38:55] all know the story, right?
[38:57] it that that that story of that tree.
[38:59] But here's here's what got me. Now
[39:01] remember, I'm preaching to you today on
[39:03] two trees. What got me was Brother Brham
[39:07] used an example
[39:11] that if the devil could get you to
[39:14] believe it, he would use. Yeah.
[39:17] So if I put a bucket of water on that
[39:19] post,
[39:21] remember that? Right. So, what is going
[39:24] to tell that bucket of water to go to?
[39:27] Well, it ain't ain't going to happen.
[39:28] But the devil is going to try to
[39:30] convince you that it can. Right, man.
[39:34] Because he does not want you to
[39:36] understand the nature of God by
[39:39] understanding the nature of God. Right.
[39:42] Amen. The sack goes down. And we know
[39:47] this. I live in high country where
[39:50] there's pine trees and a few hardwood
[39:52] trees. I have a few uh small scrub oak
[39:56] in the midst of my pine trees on my
[39:58] property. And
[40:00] without any kind of a sign or an
[40:05] indication, what is wrong with that
[40:07] aspen tree? What is wrong with that oak
[40:10] tree? The leaves are starting to turn
[40:12] yellow. Yep. Right. What is yellow? It's
[40:15] the color of death. But notice something
[40:17] about those yellow leaves. As winter is
[40:21] going to approach, some intelligence
[40:23] told the sap and those trees, it's time
[40:27] to leave. That's right.
[40:30] Wh why why would it be time to leave?
[40:33] Because winter is coming. Yep. It's
[40:36] going to get cold and that sap is going
[40:38] to freeze inside and that tree is going
[40:41] to die. Amen. That's right. Amen. Now
[40:44] remember, I'm preaching to you on Oh,
[40:46] yeah. See,
[40:49] where's my wife? She'll
[40:52] laugh. I had a hanger for my jacket back
[40:55] there, and I moved it up here. And I
[40:58] keep walking back there to hang
[41:00] it. All is well. All is well. Now,
[41:03] brothers and sisters, this may just seem
[41:05] like a common message to you, but you
[41:08] just please hang on. That's right,
[41:09] brother. Amen. Because we're going to
[41:11] find out something about God's word.
[41:13] Amen. Amen. We're going to find out that
[41:16] because there are true trees and those
[41:19] trees were allowed by God to be planted
[41:22] in that garden. Yes.
[41:25] That actions
[41:29] speak louder than words. Amen.
[41:33] No matter how loud the words are. Listen
[41:38] now. And no matter who said them.
[41:42] Amen. And I'm including God in that.
[41:45] Amen. Because he knew his words would
[41:49] produce something once he spoke them. So
[41:52] they would speak action. Amen. Right.
[41:57] Amen. You can talk about resurrection
[41:59] all day and all night and all year and
[42:02] all your life, but without somebody
[42:04] actually performing it,
[42:07] they will begin to fall on deaf ears.
[42:10] Amen. After a while, it'll be eat,
[42:13] drink, and be merry, for the Lord
[42:15] delayeth his coming. As a matter of
[42:16] fact, I'm not sure there even is a Lord.
[42:18] Yeah.
[42:21] And just because he said he was coming
[42:22] and he hasn't gotten here yet. I I've
[42:24] looked around this place for all my
[42:26] life. I ain't seen him. See how that
[42:28] man, right, was being was being used?
[42:34] Well, who was using that man? Do you
[42:37] think that that man would also confess
[42:39] that I haven't seen the devil on my
[42:41] property for 70 years?
[42:44] I want you to think about there's two
[42:46] trees now.
[42:48] And I also want you to understand before
[42:50] I go any further that you and I
[42:51] represent one of those two trees.
[42:55] Amen. So if there was two trees and
[42:58] there was two different trees, they had
[43:00] to get their start from two different
[43:03] seeds.
[43:04] Amen.
[43:05] Amen. All right. Now, I want you to go
[43:09] over to Genesis 3. You're there. You're
[43:17] close. And people would
[43:20] dispute with the
[43:23] prophet about the serpent seat. Yeah.
[43:27] But there shouldn't be if they was Bible
[43:29] believers. I could see if an atheist is
[43:32] I don't believe that Bible so why should
[43:34] I accept that but somebody who who
[43:36] believes that the Bible is God's word
[43:39] would read verse 15 in Genesis 3 Amen
[43:43] and they would have to admit listen now
[43:46] let's do 14 and the Lord God said unto
[43:48] the serpent
[43:51] because thou hast done this thou art
[43:53] cursed above all the cattle and above
[43:55] every beast of the field upon thy belly
[43:57] shalt thou go and dust shalt thou shall
[44:00] eat all the days of thy life. Yep. And
[44:03] he's still eating dust. That's right,
[44:04] brother. Because when you and I die,
[44:07] that's all that's left. That's right.
[44:08] Amen.
[44:10] And I will put enmity, that means
[44:12] hatred.
[44:14] Bold hatred, strong hatred,
[44:18] between thee and the woman. And
[44:20] remember, the woman is a type of the
[44:23] church. Amen.
[44:25] And between thy seat. Now, here's God
[44:29] talking to the serpent and he uses the
[44:32] term thy seed. So, the serpent has a
[44:35] seed. Amen. The misunderstanding of
[44:38] people is that they're focusing on the
[44:41] wrong tree. Amen. They're looking at the
[44:44] physical world we live in and they can't
[44:46] figure out where the serpent is cuz God
[44:49] changed him into a snake.
[44:54] They will find I don't care. I'm gonna
[44:57] quote the prophet. I don't care what
[45:00] anybody tells you. Now, Brother Brandham
[45:02] said this. I don't care where it comes
[45:05] from. If anybody tries to tell you
[45:08] anything that's different from this
[45:10] Bible, don't you believe it.
[45:15] Amen. That's right. Now, it doesn't say
[45:17] they're not going to come and tell you.
[45:19] Oh, yeah.
[45:21] It doesn't say that you're not going to
[45:23] hear what they're saying.
[45:25] It says don't believe it. That's right.
[45:29] That is the number one stage of the
[45:32] journey for you to go any further with
[45:35] God. Otherwise, it's an intellectual
[45:38] conception and somebody talked you into
[45:41] it, even if it was your own
[45:43] subconscious, and it will talk you out
[45:46] of it. Right, brother? Amen.
[45:49] Yes. So, the best thing you could do is
[45:52] not listen. Amen. That's right. Amen.
[45:56] Don't listen to anything contrary, but
[45:58] people do it.
[46:00] It's human nature. Amen. Some call it
[46:03] curiosity. Yeah. You if you're curious,
[46:08] you only got one life. You're not your
[46:11] cat. Yeah. Try it, brother.
[46:14] One life is all you got, brother. Amen.
[46:17] Take good care of it. Amen. All right.
[46:20] Amen. That's what Adam was told to do by
[46:26] God in this garden was, "I'm putting you
[46:29] here. There are two trees. One of them
[46:32] you can eat off of anytime you want. And
[46:34] the other one, don't touch it." Amen. My
[46:37] brother. Amen.
[46:39] Now, how you going to get a gardener?
[46:42] Yeah. Come on, brother. To not pull up
[46:44] the weeds.
[46:48] Don't touch it. Yeah.
[46:50] Because if you do, so Adam had to leave
[46:54] that tree alone.
[46:56] He couldn't prune it.
[46:59] He couldn't eat the fruit. He couldn't
[47:01] even gather the fruit from it. Amen.
[47:05] Think about it now. See, now God's
[47:07] giving you and I a warning. Yes. You
[47:09] stay as far away
[47:12] from the tree of knowledge of good and
[47:15] evil as possible. I'm not talking about
[47:18] in the natural world. Well, brother,
[47:19] that means we can't go to the doctor
[47:21] because brother Bam said that that that
[47:24] was the tree of knowledge of good and
[47:25] evil working its best. Right. Right.
[47:28] Right. But he also told us because he's
[47:31] talking to a natural, dying, corrupt,
[47:36] sick human being. He's talking to us and
[47:38] he's telling us something. He's he's
[47:40] telling us that the tree of knowledge of
[47:42] good and evil
[47:45] is there for a purpose. That's right.
[47:48] Amen. Right. That's right. But that tree
[47:51] is not the tree you're to you're to get
[47:54] your nutrients from.
[47:58] It's there for one purpose. It was put
[48:01] there because God's fornowledge knew
[48:03] there would be a fall and people would
[48:06] get sick and they would run to the
[48:07] doctor. Right. We're good with that.
[48:10] Yeah. Sure. Yeah. But once the doctor
[48:13] has closed his book, folded up his
[48:16] glasses, put them in the pocket, put
[48:18] your charts in his folder, and said, "I
[48:20] can't do nothing for you." Amen. Come
[48:22] on, brother. There's still another tree.
[48:24] Amen. There's still another tree.
[48:29] All right. So, let I'm just I'm having a
[48:32] good time now. All right.
[48:35] So, we can see here in Genesis 3:15 that
[48:38] there's two different seeds. Amen. Two
[48:42] different seeds will produce two
[48:44] different trees.
[48:46] Huh? Amen. Can I take off now? Go ahead.
[48:49] Listen. Now I'm going to shift
[48:52] gears. I'm going to read to you a few
[48:55] paragraphs and preach out of them if
[48:57] you'll let me. On the seed shall not be
[49:00] heir with the shock Los Angeles,
[49:02] California
[49:04] 42965. And guess what? It was at
[49:07] breakfast. Right.
[49:10] I like breakfast.
[49:12] Around God's table. Amen. That's right.
[49:15] I can go on that. Amen. Listen to what
[49:18] he says. He was
[49:20] God. Paragraph 79. The logos. Yeah. The
[49:26] word that went out of God. Wait a
[49:28] minute. He was God and then he was the
[49:30] word that went out of God. Oh yeah.
[49:34] Amen. We're in John 1:1 now. That's
[49:37] right. And John 1:14.
[49:40] See, so actions speak and the words are
[49:47] heard and they bring forth. That's
[49:51] right. All right.
[49:53] When he began to brood upon the earth
[49:56] and brought forth marine life, when the
[50:00] spirit of God, the logos, the word which
[50:03] God said, "Let there be."
[50:06] And there went the logos which is the
[50:09] word. Now have you all ever taken the
[50:13] time to listen to the questions and
[50:16] answers and and answers on Genesis about
[50:18] the first 15 pages. Brother Brandham
[50:22] goes into
[50:24] how this all came about. Amen.
[50:28] First of all, there was nothing right
[50:31] now. Brother Brandham uses the term
[50:33] darkness.
[50:34] But the scripture says God is light. So
[50:38] how can there be darkness
[50:41] where there is God? Because your eyes do
[50:45] not pick up the light of God. God
[50:49] permitted it to have its picture taken
[50:51] once or twice in our known modern
[50:55] civilization.
[50:57] That is a supernatural light. It is not
[51:02] a normal light. So if you can't see the
[51:05] supernatural light and you were before
[51:07] there was anything brought into
[51:09] existence, you couldn't see the light
[51:11] and it was dark. Amen.
[51:13] There's darkness. That's good. Right.
[51:16] But we believe in a supernatural light.
[51:20] That's what's burning in your soul right
[51:22] now. I dare you to see it. Amen.
[51:29] When they do open heart surgery,
[51:34] They don't see that light. No. Well,
[51:37] we're told by a prophet from God who
[51:39] made this body, not the prophet God.
[51:43] That there is a light, a space, a room
[51:47] for a light in your actual heart muscle
[51:51] cavity. I've seen it cuz I went to one
[51:55] of them their displays of how they took
[51:57] the body and sliced it up into little
[51:59] thin paper slices.
[52:02] And I I I wanted to remediate. I didn't
[52:04] care about none of that. I wanted to get
[52:06] right over there to the little display
[52:08] where the heart muscle was. And sure
[52:09] enough, about the size of an
[52:13] almond shaped like an almond. Does that
[52:17] ring a bell? Yeah. I know about a dead
[52:19] almond. Amen. That was brought to life
[52:22] in the light of God. Amen. Aaron's rod
[52:25] budded. Amen. In that holiest of holy
[52:28] places because the light of God came
[52:30] down and met with it. Now, brothers and
[52:31] sisters, you and I got to meet with that
[52:32] same light. Amen. We ain't going to get
[52:35] there on how well we think. Amen. We're
[52:40] not even going to get there on how well
[52:41] we live. But once that light comes into
[52:44] you, then its actions begin to speak and
[52:47] they become louder than your words, the
[52:49] brother Brandham said. And he said, "You
[52:50] live me a sermon, right? Long before you
[52:53] preach me one. Live it." See that light?
[52:57] See that light coming? And brother Bram
[52:58] says, "This same light was brooding."
[53:00] Yes. Okay. Oh yeah. Amen. He said it was
[53:02] brooding over the earth. Amen. And it
[53:04] said, "Let there be." And there went the
[53:06] logos, which is the word. And the word
[53:08] Now, brothers and sisters, I want to I
[53:10] could preach a whole message on three
[53:11] paragraphs right here. We think the word
[53:13] is the letter. Yeah.
[53:17] Come on. Yeah. Right. Now, people are
[53:19] like, "Oh, what's he gonna say?" I can't
[53:21] say amen because I don't know what he's
[53:23] gonna say, but I understand that the
[53:24] letter kleth. That's right, brother.
[53:26] Amen.
[53:28] So this same book that I hold in my hand
[53:32] that has the words of life in it,
[53:36] Amen. can also kill you. That's right.
[53:39] If you don't keep them, you die. Same
[53:43] words.
[53:45] Same words are so powerful that the
[53:47] prophet of God, allowing me to
[53:48] paraphrase, said, "The very same message
[53:51] that you hear preached will be the same
[53:54] message that judges those Amen." at the
[53:57] judgment. Amen. Amen. Amen. And he also
[54:02] says that there's three kinds of
[54:04] believers in every church. That's right.
[54:06] Now, now, now I realize that we're all
[54:08] humans here and we're and some of us are
[54:10] kind of still on the edge and some of us
[54:13] have been uh put into a position where
[54:15] somebody's introduced an idea where,
[54:18] yeah, I'm not sure about that. Yeah,
[54:23] I'm not talking to that believer. That's
[54:25] right.
[54:27] Amen. I'm talking to you. That's right.
[54:30] Amen.
[54:31] You are three kinds of believers. Amen.
[54:34] Each one of us is three kinds of
[54:37] believers. Amen. Yes, we are. This
[54:40] corruptible body of flesh has never
[54:43] believed a word I said or it would be
[54:45] young and handsome and have hair. Yeah.
[54:47] Amen.
[54:49] It wouldn't have stooped shoulders. It
[54:51] wouldn't have pains. All right, brother.
[54:54] Amen. unbeliever. Yeah.
[54:58] But there's a man in the engine room.
[55:00] Amen. Amen. And he is the believer
[55:04] because he has come across the path of
[55:06] the light of God that the human eye
[55:09] cannot see. That's the reason why it
[55:11] looked like there was just darkness.
[55:14] Right.
[55:17] But God began to brood over himself and
[55:21] he began to bring birth of himself into
[55:25] a world that did not yet exist. Amen.
[55:30] You understand that? That's what
[55:32] creation is. God was not created. Right
[55:36] now, the word God lends itself to be
[55:40] defined as an object of worship.
[55:43] Right. Amen. But we believe in the life
[55:47] that's in that God. That's right. That's
[55:50] the actions that I'm speaking of.
[55:53] Anybody can say anything they want, but
[55:55] can they bring life into it? Can they
[55:59] bring it up from nothing
[56:02] into a living vibrant
[56:07] breathing? Amen. That's the God we
[56:10] serve. Right, brother? At least I
[56:12] believe that's the God we serve. Amen.
[56:16] And the word begin to because all this
[56:19] was in the logos. I want you to get in
[56:21] the logos. Amen. Now the word logos in
[56:25] your Bible, I carry a scullfield not
[56:27] because so much brother Brandham carried
[56:28] one. I like some of the things that are
[56:30] in it and the references it makes. And
[56:33] Dr. Scullfield tells us that the word
[56:35] logos.
[56:36] Yeah.
[56:39] Are you ready? does not mean word like
[56:43] you and I define it. That's right. Amen.
[56:45] The word logos means thought. Yeah.
[56:48] Amen. Or concept. But I'll stay with the
[56:51] with the definition thought. Yeah.
[56:55] This was all taking place in what you
[56:58] and I would recognize as creatures of
[57:01] time as the mind of God. Amen. Right.
[57:05] Brother, a thought. Yeah.
[57:08] Now, you and I get
[57:10] thoughts, but our thoughts are held
[57:12] hostage and they're captive. Yeah. Amen.
[57:15] That's it. By the
[57:18] boundaries of what makes us up. Yes.
[57:22] But not God's.
[57:25] His
[57:27] thoughts, his words
[57:30] speak action. Amen. You with me? Amen.
[57:33] Actions speak louder than words. What is
[57:37] the original seed? Yeah.
[57:40] The spoken word. That's right. But you
[57:43] would not and could not accept it unless
[57:47] what it said came to pass. Amen.
[57:52] That's the action I'm talking about.
[57:54] Right. Good. Now you say, "Well, where
[57:56] you going with this with the trees?" Oh,
[57:57] we'll get there at least by tomorrow
[58:00] afternoon. That's right. Amen. because
[58:03] I'm having a good time. As the logos
[58:05] begin to
[58:08] breathe, a thought has breath.
[58:14] They began to breathe. He says, upon the
[58:18] earth.
[58:21] Come on. Amen. You're going to see in
[58:24] Genesis 2 that God breathed the breath
[58:28] of the logos. breathe the breath of life
[58:30] into Adam and he became a living soul.
[58:33] That same breath Jesus who was God
[58:36] manifest in the flesh. Now watch his
[58:38] actions speak. Breathe on the disciples
[58:41] after his resurrection. And he said,
[58:44] "Receive ye the Holy Ghost." They didn't
[58:46] get it right then. Amen.
[58:50] I'll read you in a place where brother
[58:51] Benham said that every time you overcome
[58:55] something, it makes a little bit of
[58:58] room. Yeah, for the Holy Ghost. Amen.
[59:01] Amen. And he says the more you overcome
[59:03] it, the more certified. Yeah. The the
[59:06] the the more uh how how would I say it?
[59:09] Fortified that space is. Now, the Holy
[59:12] Ghost may not have been there yet, but
[59:15] you're making room for him.
[59:18] just by overcoming.
[59:21] Now, brothers and sisters, we'll
[59:22] overcome something and then the devil
[59:24] whack and we'll fall back and go, "Well,
[59:27] maybe I didn't have what I thought I had
[59:29] when I No, maybe you didn't." But you
[59:32] keep overcoming and that space will
[59:34] become fortified. And that same God who
[59:37] gave you the uncction to overcome will
[59:39] fill that space. But there's more space
[59:42] to fill.
[59:45] He's not done yet. He won't be done
[59:48] until you have been fully restored to
[59:51] what you should have been
[59:54] before the fall.
[59:57] Right. That's right. Believe that with
[59:59] all my heart. Amen. Cuz it's happening
[1:00:01] to me. It's happening to me personally.
[1:00:03] Why? Because I'm going to take God at
[1:00:05] his word. I don't care what the world
[1:00:07] says. I don't care what the internet
[1:00:10] says. I don't care what Google says. I
[1:00:13] don't care what my neighbor says. Amen.
[1:00:15] I don't even care what my own mentality
[1:00:17] says.
[1:00:19] Amen. If God says turn right and my my
[1:00:23] GPS up here says turn left, I'm turning
[1:00:25] right. Amen. All right. Because I may be
[1:00:28] able to get there if I turn left, but
[1:00:31] I'll be in his permissive will the whole
[1:00:33] time. Who wants to live their life in
[1:00:37] the permissive will of God? That's why
[1:00:40] we're struggling. Amen.
[1:00:42] There's a man in here who can say amen
[1:00:45] to every word and that begins to put him
[1:00:48] on the path of God's perfect will.
[1:00:51] Amen.
[1:00:53] Many people don't even seek counsel
[1:00:55] anymore.
[1:00:58] Because of the information age we've
[1:01:00] got. They've got this doctor and that
[1:01:03] doctor and they've got I mean Amazon
[1:01:05] will send you your prescriptions. You
[1:01:06] just tell them what you want.
[1:01:08] How do you know what you want? How do
[1:01:10] you know what you need? Well, now I'm
[1:01:12] talking about the soul. There's only one
[1:01:15] counsel that I'm interested in. And I
[1:01:18] believe that God has imputed that into
[1:01:22] his fivefold ministry that he hath
[1:01:25] placed some. And that would be the
[1:01:28] council of his own will. Amen. What a
[1:01:31] council meeting that would be. Wouldn't
[1:01:33] you like to show up there? Yeah. Amen.
[1:01:36] You can read in the Bible where God
[1:01:38] called a council together to talk about
[1:01:41] how they was going to get Balam. Y right
[1:01:47] where God wanted him. Y cuz Balam
[1:01:50] refused. Y he he he knew God God told
[1:01:53] him, "Hey, don't you curse them people."
[1:01:55] Right. That's why the only time during
[1:01:58] that airplane fight in that three I told
[1:02:01] the people when we got up, you all wore
[1:02:02] me out and everybody in the plane just
[1:02:04] busted up.
[1:02:07] And the guys looked at me and I said,
[1:02:08] "You're just nonstop from from three and
[1:02:11] a half
[1:02:13] hours." And the reason I said that
[1:02:15] because I was fishing. Yeah. Cuz I
[1:02:18] already had my finger in the spot where
[1:02:21] Daniel said, "Don't worry about Israel."
[1:02:23] God told, "Don't worry." Gabriel said,
[1:02:25] "Don't worry about Israel."
[1:02:29] And when you begin, let me give you some
[1:02:30] homework. You begin to read Daniel
[1:02:33] chapter 11 and you're going to go, "Oh,
[1:02:35] this could be this guy and this could be
[1:02:36] this guy and this this could be the guy
[1:02:38] we got now and this could be it's
[1:02:39] compound. It's been the same guy over
[1:02:42] and over and over and over. Let me get
[1:02:45] to the bugs here in a minute."
[1:02:48] That begin to destroy the tree. Same
[1:02:50] bugs. Polar worm, cankerorm,
[1:02:53] caterpillar. Amen. Same bug. Amen. Guess
[1:02:58] what, brothers and sisters?
[1:03:01] That bug is in each one of us.
[1:03:03] Absolutely.
[1:03:05] Brother Brandham said that same bug and
[1:03:07] he typed it with the skin worms that are
[1:03:11] already in you. Oh,
[1:03:16] germaphobes. Oh, you can't get rid of
[1:03:18] them. You'll end up like Howard Hughes.
[1:03:22] A raven maniac.
[1:03:25] Afraid. Oh, it's coming for me.
[1:03:29] What's coming for you? Death.
[1:03:34] That's what really everybody's afraid
[1:03:35] of. That's why we believe in a
[1:03:38] resurrection. Amen. Shall I move
[1:03:40] forward? Amen. Just give me a little
[1:03:42] more time. And then the logos begin to
[1:03:44] breathe upon the earth. There come
[1:03:45] marine life and building up and bird
[1:03:48] life and up to animal life. And finally,
[1:03:52] there comes something in the
[1:03:54] representation or looked like the thing.
[1:03:57] Right. Right.
[1:03:59] that was brewing it. And then brother
[1:04:01] corrects brother Brandham corrects
[1:04:03] himself and says brooding over it. All
[1:04:06] right. Amen. Then he says
[1:04:09] God. That's who's doing the brooding.
[1:04:12] God. Listen. A man in the very image of
[1:04:15] God. Amen.
[1:04:18] What is the ultimate promise to you and
[1:04:20] I? Resurrection.
[1:04:22] It's let us make man in our image and
[1:04:25] after our likeness. Why? Because that's
[1:04:27] how Amen. the resurrection lays within
[1:04:29] you. Amen. That's how this temple can be
[1:04:32] torn down and we'll raise it up again.
[1:04:35] That's how you can lay your life down
[1:04:37] and raise it up again. That's how you
[1:04:39] can make this statement. I came from
[1:04:41] God. I'm quoting brother Brandham. You
[1:04:44] just have to go search it out and I'm
[1:04:46] going back to God. Amen.
[1:04:48] Because I believe that. And you have to
[1:04:52] be a believer in order to get there.
[1:04:55] That's right, brother. Amen. I'm only up
[1:04:58] here behind this desk today to cheer you
[1:05:02] on. Amen. Come on. Amen. Let's not sit
[1:05:06] around warming the bench collecting
[1:05:09] splinters. Let's get in the game. Well,
[1:05:12] they won't let me play. Who's they?
[1:05:16] That's right.
[1:05:18] God opened this roster up to every
[1:05:22] single human being that would accept it.
[1:05:24] Amen.
[1:05:26] And that's going to be the team. And
[1:05:29] there's no eye in team as we know that's
[1:05:32] going to defeat the enemy. Amen. Now,
[1:05:36] the last enemy is death. Yeah. Right.
[1:05:38] Well, why are we dying? Right. Come on.
[1:05:43] Come on. You see what the devil would do
[1:05:45] with that? He would say, "You see,
[1:05:47] perhaps Jesus never rose from the dead
[1:05:49] because you're all dying.
[1:05:53] Two trees." Y
[1:05:57] was always meant to be two trees.
[1:06:01] Yes. It's just that the tree of
[1:06:02] knowledge of good and evil was never
[1:06:04] meant
[1:06:07] to be touched. Yeah.
[1:06:10] How can I prove that there was there's
[1:06:12] going to be two trees?
[1:06:14] Adam,
[1:06:16] brother Brandham says, was like a tree
[1:06:19] and his toes were like roots and he was
[1:06:22] standing there. Now maybe he was moving
[1:06:25] around before that, but his toes were
[1:06:27] like roots.
[1:06:30] And then the breath of life was breathed
[1:06:32] into him and he became a living soul. So
[1:06:37] you can even have roots. Yeah. And be
[1:06:41] dead. Yes. Amen. Twice
[1:06:45] plucked up. Amen. By the roots. Amen.
[1:06:50] You get that? Twice. Why would they Why?
[1:06:53] How? How could you be twice plucked up,
[1:06:57] Brother Donnie? Because there's two
[1:06:59] trees. Amen. There's the one you're
[1:07:02] looking at and the one inside. Amen.
[1:07:06] There's the tree of knowledge of good
[1:07:08] and evil, and there is the tree of life.
[1:07:11] Amen. Amen. Amen. They are both in the
[1:07:14] midst of the same garden. Amen. Just
[1:07:18] depends on which one chief feeds the
[1:07:21] most. As to who comes out on top. Amen.
[1:07:26] Stop touching that tree of knowledge of
[1:07:28] good and evil. Again, I have to say this
[1:07:31] because people
[1:07:33] like, I can't go to the doctor. Yes,
[1:07:38] but you can't trust him.
[1:07:42] I'm just be honest. You you take it in
[1:07:45] the tree of knowledge of listen now it's
[1:07:47] good.
[1:07:50] But you can never get away from the evil
[1:07:52] cuz it's and not or and evil
[1:07:57] and we have to do these things. We
[1:07:58] realize that it's like somebody's
[1:08:01] saying, "Well, the Lord is going to uh
[1:08:04] you you guys know the story about the
[1:08:06] guy it's in the flood and he's on top of
[1:08:08] the house." Everybody knows that story.
[1:08:10] Amen. And he's a believer, he thinks.
[1:08:14] Yeah.
[1:08:16] And a guy in a boat comes by to get him
[1:08:18] off and oh, the Lord will rescue me.
[1:08:20] Pretty soon, a helicopter lowers down a
[1:08:22] basket and he says, "Nope, the Lord will
[1:08:23] rescue me." Next thing he finds himself
[1:08:25] at the the judgment, "Lord, I don't
[1:08:29] understand. I was down there on the top
[1:08:31] of the house during the flood and I
[1:08:33] might put all my trust in you.
[1:08:38] How come I drone? I sent you a boat and
[1:08:42] a helicopter. That's right. That's
[1:08:45] right.
[1:08:46] See, you can't look at things, brothers
[1:08:49] and sisters, the way that these eyes
[1:08:54] interpret them. True, brother. Amen.
[1:08:56] Something has to be deeper than that.
[1:08:59] Something has to be greater than that.
[1:09:00] Now, when you plant a seed, and the
[1:09:03] reason I brought that up a minute ago is
[1:09:05] because the woman has a seed, right?
[1:09:08] Or does she? Yeah.
[1:09:13] She doesn't have one naturally. No. But
[1:09:16] God, before the foundation of the world,
[1:09:18] when he said, "Let us make man in our
[1:09:20] image and after our likeness, both male
[1:09:22] and female," said two trees.
[1:09:25] There's going to be two trees. Yeah. And
[1:09:28] I'm going to use those two trees to
[1:09:30] bring my
[1:09:31] plan to fruition. No pun intended.
[1:09:36] To fruit. Yes. Amen. But he knew all the
[1:09:39] time that when he
[1:09:42] allowed the rib to be taken out of
[1:09:45] Adam's side, that tree, that's like
[1:09:48] ungrafting a branch. Amen. That's that
[1:09:52] he brother Brandham called it a
[1:09:54] byproduct.
[1:09:55] Is that right? Amen. That's like
[1:09:57] grafting in a branch to life, but it not
[1:10:00] being from the roots of life. It will
[1:10:03] produce fruit. That's the only Listen,
[1:10:05] brothers and sisters, please, young
[1:10:06] people. That's the only thing Satan's
[1:10:08] got. Yeah. He ain't got you unless you
[1:10:12] give yourself to him. He ain't got your
[1:10:15] life unless you lend him your life.
[1:10:18] Amen. True, brother. Don't forget that.
[1:10:22] Yeah. When you're under pressure, when
[1:10:24] the devil is trying to convince you that
[1:10:27] something's not right and they're having
[1:10:29] a better time over there,
[1:10:31] their better time is temporary and they
[1:10:34] are dying. Amen. Amen. But when the when
[1:10:38] the God of life of the tree of life
[1:10:40] anchors in your soul, you don't care
[1:10:43] anymore. Amen. Yes. I still got aches
[1:10:46] and pains and I'm not what I used to be,
[1:10:49] right? I'm not even what I want to be,
[1:10:52] but I know someday I'm going to be.
[1:10:56] That's all that matters in this life.
[1:10:59] But we'll be shoveling dirt on you in no
[1:11:01] time. Right.
[1:11:04] Two trees. Yeah. Come on, brother. Okay.
[1:11:07] Yeah. I better keep moving. You're good.
[1:11:10] Listen
[1:11:11] now. Brooding over it, God. A man in the
[1:11:15] very image of God, that man fell. Yep.
[1:11:19] How could he fall?
[1:11:23] The same way God sent John the Baptist
[1:11:27] to begin the process of destroying the
[1:11:31] tree of knowledge of good and evil.
[1:11:32] Amen. John the Baptist, the third use of
[1:11:37] the spirit of Elijah, God put an axe in
[1:11:40] his hand and he didn't chop the limbs
[1:11:43] off.
[1:11:44] God did that. He pruned those limbs. The
[1:11:47] Bible says, "But John's job was to turn
[1:11:51] the hearts of the fathers to the
[1:11:54] children, and he began to lay the axe to
[1:11:56] the root of the tree."
[1:11:58] Amen. Amen.
[1:12:01] But the fourth time, God chose to use
[1:12:04] the spirit of Elijah.
[1:12:06] The third time was handed off to the
[1:12:09] fourth time. How do I know that, brother
[1:12:12] Luis? because it opens up Malachi 4 with
[1:12:15] there will be neither root nor branch.
[1:12:19] I'm going to take this thing down to
[1:12:21] where it cannot bring forth.
[1:12:25] No seed, no fruit, no branches, no
[1:12:27] leaves, no bark, no life. Right. Amen.
[1:12:31] Well, the devil is just an impersonator,
[1:12:34] right? So that's why he's got his four
[1:12:36] bugs working. That's right. Amen. Who
[1:12:38] mentioned to me the fourth man in the
[1:12:39] fire? Yeah. Just before I come out for
[1:12:42] service, the fourth, it was brother
[1:12:44] Joseph, the fourth man in the fire.
[1:12:47] Everybody says, "Oh, the number four is
[1:12:48] a bad number." It's also the number of
[1:12:50] deliverance.
[1:12:53] But people get confused. Watch this.
[1:12:56] There's the father, the word, and the
[1:12:59] spirit. And these three are one. Is that
[1:13:02] right? Well, I've heard men preach that
[1:13:06] makes four. They don't understand God's
[1:13:09] math. That's right. That's right. The
[1:13:10] fourth man in the fire was the number of
[1:13:13] deliverance to deliver the first three.
[1:13:17] They were all one. Listen, if he if he
[1:13:19] had not become one with the Hebrew
[1:13:21] children, they would have got pretty
[1:13:23] crisp.
[1:13:27] They didn't even smell like smoke. They
[1:13:30] didn't even have an eyelash curled up.
[1:13:33] Amen. They still had hair in their ears.
[1:13:36] Yeah. Amen. Amen.
[1:13:38] Think about it.
[1:13:42] These three are one. Amen. And that's
[1:13:46] what God is portraying to you and me
[1:13:49] through the end time message. Listen,
[1:13:52] brothers and sisters, the message is not
[1:13:55] new.
[1:13:58] It's been around since the angels were
[1:14:01] in heaven and there was no earth yet.
[1:14:04] That's right. Amen.
[1:14:06] Because I want to ask you this. What
[1:14:08] were they fighting over? That's right.
[1:14:11] What was their first estate? Yes. That's
[1:14:14] right. They were given a word by God and
[1:14:18] were and told keep it. Yes. All right.
[1:14:21] Amen. And everybody's talking about all
[1:14:23] the good preachers, by the way. Oh, this
[1:14:25] guy's a good preacher. And that my wife
[1:14:27] and I just laugh. I'm a terrible
[1:14:29] preacher,
[1:14:31] but I love the Lord and I love his
[1:14:32] heritage. And I'll fight to the death
[1:14:35] for any one of you. Amen. Amen. Right,
[1:14:38] brother. But the best preacher there is
[1:14:42] Lucifer. Yes.
[1:14:45] So good.
[1:14:46] He's so savvy. He's so He's got so much
[1:14:49] charisma.
[1:14:51] Amen.
[1:14:53] He's Elvis. Yep. He's Michael Jackson. Y
[1:14:56] he's Mariah Carey. Who's this other girl
[1:15:00] that's real popular? I can't think of
[1:15:01] her name in the NFL thing. You know what
[1:15:04] I mean? Yeah. It doesn't matter. Put all
[1:15:05] them names in there. Put them all.
[1:15:11] He's all them wrapped in. Yeah. He is to
[1:15:13] one. He knows exactly how to hit those
[1:15:17] strings and bring what's in you out.
[1:15:22] That's right. Right. But God just asked
[1:15:25] you and I to do one thing, and that's
[1:15:28] hang on. Yeah. to the word I've given
[1:15:31] you. That's what the message of our hour
[1:15:34] is. It's not so much the voice and the
[1:15:37] and the and the printing of William Mary
[1:15:39] and Brandham. He's just a vessel.
[1:15:42] Really, he was just a carrier of the
[1:15:44] life. Amen. Now, fortunately, he was
[1:15:48] like the fourth man in the fire because
[1:15:50] he went beyond the first three stages.
[1:15:53] Amen. Amen. But look at what everybody's
[1:15:55] doing, right? We got to go back to
[1:15:57] Pentecost.
[1:15:59] Yeah. Well, then you best find that
[1:16:01] little room over there in Jerusalem.
[1:16:04] That's right, brother. Amen. See,
[1:16:07] because those are carriers of the stages
[1:16:10] just like brother Brandham told us. And
[1:16:13] it's so plain. Mary, can you imagine
[1:16:16] Mary being just a carrier?
[1:16:20] Right. Be it unto me according to the
[1:16:22] Bible. Oh, that's a believer. if I ever
[1:16:23] saw one and meant it and was willing to
[1:16:27] receive it. Her actions spoke for her
[1:16:31] words. Amen. But not without an angel.
[1:16:36] Not without a messenger. A messenger
[1:16:38] came down and told her
[1:16:42] who she was.
[1:16:44] You're blessed amongst women.
[1:16:50] My church don't have enough pews. Yeah.
[1:16:53] See, it's a type.
[1:16:56] A woman and a church are a type. Brother
[1:17:00] Benham typed Mary as the church. Listen
[1:17:03] now of the last Pentecostal movement
[1:17:06] age. Oh, we listen. If you're justified,
[1:17:10] what stage of the journey is that? But
[1:17:12] you don't leave justification always is
[1:17:15] with you.
[1:17:17] The second stage of the journey is
[1:17:19] sanctification. You begin. Brother
[1:17:21] Brandham said, "What God did for you was
[1:17:24] justify you. What you do for God, I'm
[1:17:27] quoting Brother Benham, you work out
[1:17:30] your own salvation with You got to You
[1:17:32] got to begin to refuse." Yes. The dirt
[1:17:35] and the filth. Yes. And the garbage and
[1:17:38] the junk and God's all, "Oh, I can't
[1:17:40] overcome this. I've had brothers come in
[1:17:42] the I can't overcome this." You haven't
[1:17:44] went far enough. That's right. Cuz he's
[1:17:46] standing there waiting for you to get
[1:17:49] that far. How else can you explain it?
[1:17:52] Because God will take it away from you.
[1:17:55] Listen careful if you're willing to give
[1:17:57] it up. He doesn't take it if you don't
[1:18:00] want to give it up. He's a gentleman.
[1:18:04] But once you're sanctified, you always
[1:18:06] carry that clean, holy way of thinking
[1:18:09] and lifestyle. You don't do you throw it
[1:18:11] out? No. Well, then why would everybody
[1:18:14] think that Pentecost is something that
[1:18:16] you you experience for 10 seconds and
[1:18:19] then I don't need that anymore? Oh, then
[1:18:21] you never got it to begin with. If you
[1:18:24] get the life of God in you, no, I can
[1:18:27] look in my Bible and I can see where the
[1:18:30] 120 did not have to continue to go back
[1:18:33] to the upper room. What they did was
[1:18:35] they took those words into action.
[1:18:40] Amen. Yeah. And then they had something
[1:18:42] going on inside of them that nobody else
[1:18:45] could understand. But there were the
[1:18:46] thirsty.
[1:18:49] There were the dying spiritually
[1:18:52] speaking. And they were looking for the
[1:18:54] God. Amen. Who resurrected from the
[1:18:58] grave. And he now is living in the
[1:19:02] hearts of his children. Listen careful
[1:19:04] now. Even a tree
[1:19:07] has a heart.
[1:19:13] It's the good wood.
[1:19:16] It's the wood that carries the life.
[1:19:21] You let that heartwood die, that tree
[1:19:24] dies. Amen. You keep that life flowing
[1:19:29] through those veins in that tree. Amen.
[1:19:34] And it will bring forth fruit. Amen.
[1:19:38] What kind of fruit, brother Chris?
[1:19:40] That's what I'm going to preach on
[1:19:41] tomorrow. Right. Right. Amen. Now, I can
[1:19:44] go over the fruits of the spirit, but
[1:19:47] you all know
[1:19:49] those, but do you know what they taste
[1:19:51] like?
[1:19:54] Taste and see that the Lord is good.
[1:20:00] Please stand. Hallelujah. I'm going to
[1:20:03] read one more paragraph while you're
[1:20:04] standing. That same logos, listen now.
[1:20:08] That same logos has a part. Yes. He has
[1:20:14] got a bride. Amen. And the same logos.
[1:20:18] So remember that's a thought. Now this
[1:20:20] same thought, this word that cannot be
[1:20:24] tampered with. Come on, brother. And
[1:20:26] brother Wade and I were talking about
[1:20:27] how people are tampering with the word
[1:20:29] left and right. But this word, see,
[1:20:30] we're not talking about the letter.
[1:20:32] We're not talking about the carrier.
[1:20:34] That's right. Right. Let me let me
[1:20:36] inform you folks of something. You can
[1:20:38] pick all day long
[1:20:41] on any of God's prophet messengers and
[1:20:44] find fault. Just like they found fault
[1:20:47] with Jesus. Why? Because he was the
[1:20:50] carrier. Amen.
[1:20:52] We don't crucify you for being a good
[1:20:54] man. We're going to crucify you for
[1:20:56] being a man. Making yourself God. Boom.
[1:20:58] See? See how? Well, that that man's
[1:21:01] words don't mean a thing to me, but they
[1:21:02] do to me. Yeah. That's right. Amen.
[1:21:05] Something's happened on the inside.
[1:21:08] Amen. Brothers and sisters. Yes. And it
[1:21:11] was this very logos. Yes. Amen. It was
[1:21:14] God's very thought. It was the word of
[1:21:19] God. There's many words in this book who
[1:21:23] may not who do not seem to pertain to
[1:21:25] you.
[1:21:27] That's right.
[1:21:29] That's why when the seventh angel had
[1:21:31] the book in his hand, it was a little
[1:21:34] book
[1:21:36] inside of the bigger book. This is not
[1:21:40] only the lamb's book of
[1:21:43] life, which is a really small book.
[1:21:47] It's also the book of life which has
[1:21:52] everything in it.
[1:21:55] It's like that man approached brother
[1:21:56] Bam said, "Well, we we speak where the
[1:21:58] word speaks and we're silent where the
[1:21:59] word is silent." Brother Bam said,
[1:22:01] "Well, Judas hung himself. You go hang
[1:22:02] yourself, too." Yeah. Amen. See, see,
[1:22:05] you can't take it that way. You have to
[1:22:09] have the spirit of the author, which is
[1:22:12] the Holy Ghost living in you. And then
[1:22:16] it's a whole new
[1:22:19] book. Amen. But it's the same old book.
[1:22:22] It's a whole
[1:22:24] new Amen. Cuz now you're looking at it
[1:22:28] through eyes that can see things between
[1:22:31] the lines. Amen. Brothers and sisters
[1:22:33] that nobody else can see. You go ahead
[1:22:36] and try to explain what you believe to
[1:22:37] somebody.
[1:22:39] If they're not looking through the same
[1:22:41] pair of eyes, they will not see it.
[1:22:48] Don't lose heart.
[1:22:50] Be confident that the God that allowed
[1:22:53] you to see it is still available to
[1:22:55] allow them to see it if it pleases him
[1:22:58] and it's his will. Amen. You shake their
[1:23:02] hand and move forward. Amen. Let's pray.
[1:23:04] Father, we love you. We thank you, Lord.
[1:23:07] Forgive me for cutting up, Lord, the
[1:23:09] things that you've given me. But
[1:23:10] sometimes, Father, the the eagles, they
[1:23:13] have to have that meat torn into little
[1:23:15] pieces, Father, so that it can be
[1:23:17] palatable. and and Lord, their eyes are
[1:23:18] just bugging out of their head and all
[1:23:20] they care about is filling their
[1:23:21] stomach, Lord. But it's still the same
[1:23:23] food that the mother eagle is giving
[1:23:24] them. Now, I pray Lord that this message
[1:23:29] would be digested just like that. Lord,
[1:23:32] these aren't my words. Father, I don't
[1:23:34] even believe they're the words of
[1:23:36] William Marry and Brandham. I believe
[1:23:37] they're the words of God. Amen. Amen.
[1:23:40] Spoken through a carrier of the word,
[1:23:43] just like the ministry, just like the
[1:23:45] Bible. Amen. Many men in the Bible,
[1:23:47] Lord, we are shown who have disputed it
[1:23:50] to be God's word. And Jesus said,
[1:23:53] "You're all snakes in the grass. You're
[1:23:55] all liars. You're of your father, the
[1:23:57] devil." Ouch.
[1:24:01] Don't let those words come back to haunt
[1:24:03] us, Lord.
[1:24:06] I pray, Father, here this afternoon,
[1:24:08] Lord,
[1:24:09] that at
[1:24:11] least a strip of
[1:24:14] meat has met the beak of the eagle,
[1:24:19] Lord. And we know in nature, Father,
[1:24:22] that when there's two eagles in one
[1:24:24] nest,
[1:24:25] Lord, sometimes the little eagle dies
[1:24:28] out because the big eagle just keeps
[1:24:30] pushing it aside and taking his food
[1:24:32] away, Lord.
[1:24:35] But not in your nest,
[1:24:37] Father. Your nest is different, Lord.
[1:24:40] Because the prophet of God quoting out
[1:24:42] of the Bible said, "Your nest is stirred
[1:24:44] up."
[1:24:47] Not any one eagle gets all the food.
[1:24:51] It's distributed,
[1:24:53] Lord, by the process of
[1:24:56] stirring. Father, we love you. We thank
[1:24:59] you, Lord. We pray, Father, that these
[1:25:03] things would be taken to heart, Lord,
[1:25:05] not because I spoke them, but because
[1:25:08] they're truth.
[1:25:10] They're spoken, Father, from the word of
[1:25:12] our
[1:25:13] hour. And they have
[1:25:15] become the current interpretation
[1:25:19] of a book that's thousands of years old,
[1:25:22] Lord.
[1:25:24] Truthfully, it's perhaps millions of
[1:25:26] years old. Father, just hasn't been
[1:25:29] revealed to everyone yet. Lord, if
[1:25:32] there's any sick amongst us, I pray,
[1:25:34] even those out on the hookup, Father,
[1:25:36] that you would touch them,
[1:25:38] Lord, that you would allow, Father, that
[1:25:42] precious, wonderful gift of healing,
[1:25:45] Lord, to abide with them, Father, and
[1:25:47] that they would accept it, Lord, and
[1:25:50] take that medicine.
[1:25:52] Doctors are just experimenting and
[1:25:54] practicing, Lord, and we thank you for
[1:25:56] them. But once they reach the end of
[1:25:59] their line, Father, they cannot help us
[1:26:02] anymore. That's where you have allowed
[1:26:04] us the ability to step off of that tree
[1:26:09] and onto the tree of life. Bless your
[1:26:12] children and their efforts and their
[1:26:13] support. Father, brother Wade and Sister
[1:26:15] June and Father, all those that are here
[1:26:18] working, Father, and support the word of
[1:26:21] God through this ministry in Jesus name.
[1:26:24] Amen. Amen.
[1:26:27] Is that Lord prepare me?
[1:26:31] Prepare
[1:26:33] me to be a
[1:26:35] [Music]
[1:26:40] sanuary, pure and
[1:26:43] [Music]
[1:26:45] holy, dry and true.
[1:26:53] Thank you.
[1:26:54] [Applause]
[1:26:57] Oh, you thank
[1:26:58] [Music]
[1:27:00] [Applause]
[1:27:00] [Music]
[1:27:03] him.
[1:27:08] Sanctuary. Sing it to him again. Do you
[1:27:11] want to be that? He wants to inhabit
[1:27:14] you. And Lord,
[1:27:17] prepare me. How's he going to prepare
[1:27:20] you? By the word of God.
[1:27:23] Something you can always depend
[1:27:26] on. Pure and
[1:27:32] holy, tried and
[1:27:38] true, with
[1:27:41] thanksgiving. Thank you,
[1:27:43] Lord. Be your living.
[1:27:51] Thanks
[1:27:55] you
[1:27:59] for
[1:28:00] Amen. Amen. You love the Lord. Amen.
[1:28:03] Let's give our brother a hand
[1:28:06] clap.
[1:28:09] Good. You know, the Bible tells us that
[1:28:12] those who endure to the end Yes. shall
[1:28:15] be saved. Brother Herman, that's about
[1:28:16] all we got to go on. Yeah. But if you'll
[1:28:19] endure to the end, you got a promise.
[1:28:21] That's right. Those who endure
[1:28:23] heartache, trial, tribulations, all the
[1:28:26] things goes on in the world. Satan
[1:28:28] buffeting us all he can. But if we'll
[1:28:30] endure to the end, we'll be saved. What
[1:28:33] a promise.
[1:28:35] But we do have to endure. We're not just
[1:28:38] going to get to sit in a lounge chair
[1:28:39] for the rest of our life. No, we got to
[1:28:42] endure to the end. Right. And we sure
[1:28:44] appreciate the word of God that we can
[1:28:47] hang on to it and it will not change
[1:28:50] can't it can't change. Even if God
[1:28:53] wanted to change his mind, he can't. He
[1:28:55] just can't change his mind. He will not
[1:28:57] change his mind about his word. And he
[1:29:00] is with us. And we love all of you
[1:29:05] coming today. And we appreciate you
[1:29:07] coming and visiting with us. And uh now
[1:29:10] we got a meal downstairs. We'll go eat
[1:29:12] some natural food. If you want to just
[1:29:14] continue to fellowship, we've got all
[1:29:15] afternoon. There's no uh time limit that
[1:29:18] we have to get out of here. We own the
[1:29:20] building, so we can do whatever we want
[1:29:22] to. So, visitors, go eat first, but get
[1:29:25] in line and um and fill your stomach and
[1:29:29] then we've had a good feeling today
[1:29:33] and let's chew on it and let's come back
[1:29:35] tomorrow and and as Paul Harvey said,
[1:29:38] we'll hear the rest of the story and
[1:29:40] it's going to be good. Amen.
[1:29:43] All minds clear. Amen. Let's bow our
[1:29:45] heads. Dear heavenly father, thank you
[1:29:48] for this meeting you've given us today.
[1:29:51] Lord, you gave us
[1:29:53] a a young brother all the way from
[1:29:56] Arizona to come out here and speak the
[1:29:59] words that's been on his heart maybe for
[1:30:01] days,
[1:30:02] Lord. And he delivered it, Father, in
[1:30:05] such a wonderful way, Lord, that we even
[1:30:07] the children could understand.
[1:30:10] Now, Father, I pray that we'll chew on
[1:30:12] that as little
[1:30:14] eigllets that we'll digest it, Lord, and
[1:30:16] it'll become a sustainable life for us
[1:30:20] to live, just as our natural food will
[1:30:22] in a few minutes. Lord, I pray that
[1:30:25] you'd sanctify the food
[1:30:27] downstairs. This one up here has already
[1:30:29] been sanctified. As our brother said, we
[1:30:31] continue to go through that
[1:30:33] sanctification process, the cleaning out
[1:30:36] of this vessel. Lord, I pray that you'd
[1:30:38] be with Brother Chris and give him
[1:30:39] strength. Be with the ones that are here
[1:30:41] today, Lord, that maybe have to go back
[1:30:43] home. That you'll bless them, Lord, and
[1:30:45] keep them safe on the highways. And
[1:30:47] Lord, we'll come back together tomorrow,
[1:30:49] Lord, to serve you again one more time
[1:30:51] and to listen to what you have for us in
[1:30:54] the end time. We pray these things in
[1:30:56] Jesus name. Amen. God bless you. You're
[1:31:00] dismissed.
[1:31:04] If you have nowhere to go tomorrow, we
[1:31:06] start at 10:00 in the
[1:31:10] morning. Pure and
[1:31:16] holy, tried and
[1:31:22] true. And with
[1:31:28] thanksgiving, I'll be a
[1:31:31] [Applause]
[1:31:31] [Music]
[1:31:34] living
[1:31:40] sanctuary
[1:31:41] for
[1:31:43] you. Thank you, Lord. Oh Lord,
[1:31:48] prepare
[1:31:50] me to be your
[1:31:53] [Music]
[1:31:57] sanctuary. You're
[1:32:00] [Music]
[1:32:02] holy, oh so tried and true.
[1:32:09] And with
[1:32:11] [Music]
[1:32:14] Thanksgiving, I'll be
