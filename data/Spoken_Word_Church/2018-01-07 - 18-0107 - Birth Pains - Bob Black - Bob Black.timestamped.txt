[0:06] all right all right
[1:30] the MP nanaia children but a national
[1:35] and this man went up out of his City
[1:38] yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto
[1:41] the Lord of Hosts in Shiloh and the two
[1:43] sons of Eli hophni and Phinehas the
[1:46] priests of the Lord were they the time
[1:50] was a worthy portion for he loved him
[2:04] but the Lord had shut up and as he did
[2:17] so year by year when she went up to the
[2:19] house of the Lord
[2:20] so she provoked her therefore she will
[2:29] [Music]
[2:39] so Hannah rose up after they had eaten
[2:41] in Shiloh and after later now I give
[2:45] either pre set up on a seat by post to
[2:47] the temple of the Lord and you see a
[2:50] small triangle and she bowed about I
[2:57] said Oh Lord of Hosts if thou will
[2:59] indeed look on the affliction of that
[3:01] handmade and remember me and not forget
[3:04] that him me but will give unto thine
[3:06] handmaid a man-child then I will give
[3:08] him under the Lord all the days of his
[3:10] life and there shall no razor come upon
[3:13] his head
[3:17] or a lie
[3:21] now Hannah she's faking her heart only
[3:24] her lips move but her voice was not hurt
[3:26] therefore heal I thought she had been
[3:28] broken and I answer that said no my lord
[3:39] I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit I
[3:42] have drunk neither wine nor strong drink
[3:44] but it poured out my soul before out of
[3:52] the abundance of non-compliant and greed
[3:55] open everything then Eli answered and
[4:00] said yo and then the God of Israel grant
[4:03] deed occupation that now has asked of
[4:05] him and she said my man my vibration
[4:10] outside a woman today and her
[4:14] countenance
[4:16] and they rose up in the morning early
[4:19] and worship before the Lord and returned
[4:21] and came to the house to their house to
[4:23] Rama and elkanah knew to pana has a wife
[4:26] and the Lord remember and the man L
[4:46] comma and all his house went up to offer
[4:48] and the Lord the yearly sacrifice his
[4:51] valve
[4:53] [Music]
[5:05] [Music]
[5:06] and elkanah her husband said under do
[5:10] what seemeth thee good tarry until that
[5:12] I've weaned him only the Lord
[5:14] establishes water so the woman abode and
[5:17] make her son suck until she waited and
[5:37] brought the child to Eli for this child
[5:51] I prayed and the Lord has given me my
[5:54] petition which I has to be there
[5:58] [Music]
[6:08] what I want to talk about today because
[6:18] you can that's maybe I know a little
[6:21] scripture to read about this because if
[6:22] you see home you've got a story of of
[6:26] this this man with two wives and one of
[6:29] them has children and she's kind of you
[6:32] know there were other ones looking at
[6:33] her I don't want to have a child and
[6:36] she's going through all the process of
[6:37] sorrow and everything and grieving and
[6:40] wanting to know why my child hasn't come
[6:42] forth and and and that's kind of what
[6:45] we're going through and you know what
[6:48] you if you go back and read the message
[6:49] birth pains that brother Ram preached
[6:51] and then a lot of the sermons after that
[6:53] he talks about how that you can see the
[6:56] the time in the state of where you are
[6:58] by looking at the birth pangs you look
[7:00] at the state of the world system and all
[7:03] the things that are growing in the world
[7:04] and you can see the contractions of
[7:07] nature the things that are happening in
[7:09] nature that like war or war on - you
[7:12] know something that's got to be taking
[7:13] place you can see the World Council of
[7:16] Churches coming together it's all moving
[7:18] and so you can see down through the
[7:20] seven church ages that he kind of
[7:21] switches and he starts talking about in
[7:23] the Old Testament all the the Old
[7:25] Testament prophets every time they would
[7:27] come on the singing they've caused a
[7:29] pain a struggle because the people would
[7:32] be caught up in their other creeds and
[7:33] dogmas of the things that they thought
[7:35] were true and then a prophet and create
[7:38] a contraction right and all these
[7:41] contractions during through the Old
[7:43] Testament until finally John came on the
[7:45] scene and he introduced the word and the
[7:47] word which is what the where the whole
[7:50] process is producing the word finally
[7:53] the word came on the scene and then in a
[7:55] New Testament every every Church age a
[7:57] messenger will come upon
[7:59] scene and preach a message and and are
[8:01] these contractions would happen because
[8:03] Paul would come up on the scene and all
[8:05] the Israelites would say well well
[8:08] that's I don't know about that it caused
[8:11] all this trouble and Oh
[8:13] trumpet would sound and it create a a
[8:15] big disturbance then all the way down
[8:17] through the seven church ages and and
[8:19] you can see the hour in the time that
[8:21] you're living in by looking at what's
[8:23] whatever what the contractions are how
[8:25] hard they are what the state of of
[8:29] everything is and it ended in the seven
[8:32] churches and in your own life because a
[8:35] birth is a struggle Bertha's is painful
[8:39] and that sorrow is and there's a lot of
[8:42] it's a lot of while I was going on it
[8:46] can seem like it's a bad time so you
[8:50] know look at this little story of Hannah
[8:52] that how she was uh she was crying out
[8:55] to God for to see to see this child come
[8:59] into being and then he was born and she
[9:02] gave him over dinner to to she gave him
[9:04] over to the Lord and the Lord turned
[9:05] sangil's life into just a testimony he
[9:09] was you know kind of the he was really
[9:12] the word for that that day that a man
[9:14] been to come out on the scene and began
[9:16] to preach to the people to to bring
[9:19] deliver us to the people and that they
[9:21] could look to have understanding of what
[9:23] the word was all about and and and so
[9:26] all these types in the in the Bible
[9:30] that's where someone cried out for a
[9:32] child are really presented these people
[9:35] are living out the visual stories so
[9:37] that we would have understanding in this
[9:38] day or what we're what we're crying in
[9:40] heaven when you know is it's it's almost
[9:43] kind of difficult technically to talk
[9:45] about birth pains because you when you
[9:47] talk about a birth we're talking about
[9:49] the new birth course but it's also
[9:52] talking about the birth of the word and
[9:54] this age that crowning the head
[9:56] stone the head coming forth being born
[9:59] and so when you talk about that the
[10:01] birth your talk weakens we're going to
[10:04] talk about both kind of simultaneously
[10:06] the new birth and birth of when you and
[10:09] I'm gonna I'm planning to go kind of
[10:11] through Romans chapter eight work you
[10:13] come forth crying Abba Father and you
[10:16] grow you keep moving through this
[10:18] process of a birth so I pretty much told
[10:22] you where I'm going so I hope we're on
[10:24] the same page now and for a little bit
[10:27] because we're the birth is is is to
[10:30] produce the word and we want to see that
[10:33] child come forth that's also kind of
[10:35] difficult to talk about too because it's
[10:37] really this child is not a child it's a
[10:40] it's a grown man right when this when
[10:42] this comes complete this when you're
[10:44] born here you're your little baby crying
[10:47] Abba Father grows up and there's a birth
[10:50] birth all the way up being born again by
[10:52] the incorruptible seed until the word
[10:55] comes forth King being completeness
[10:57] right so we talked about Hannah crying
[11:01] out as Abraham and Isaac crying out
[11:05] crying out for that believing that that
[11:07] promised son would come forth until one
[11:09] day he was delivered after you'd waited
[11:11] twenty years and finally he saw the
[11:12] promised son and Isaac fill all those
[11:14] different types and everything and then
[11:16] then you keep going down Isaac came
[11:18] children which is what good round talked
[11:21] about in the birth pains that eventually
[11:23] he had two children Jacob and Esau and
[11:25] Jacob and Esau or what be or what are
[11:27] being birthed in this day Emma because
[11:30] you've got twins in areas you got twin
[11:32] that's right Jesus and Judas and Abel
[11:36] and Cain and our birth is always going
[11:38] to produce twins and that's how close it
[11:40] is I know yeah
[11:45] stable track birth is really what the
[11:51] reason is is there's so much sorer and
[11:53] this is really because the birth was
[11:55] gonna messed up from the beginning
[11:57] instead of coming the way we should have
[11:58] in genesis seeing God in the picture man
[12:01] took Kate from their own trees they were
[12:03] talking about in by Allstate last night
[12:05] a tape from carnal ideas that the things
[12:08] that Satan injected and then that
[12:10] produced this this it produced a
[12:13] situation where goddess birthing us out
[12:16] of the things of this world from the
[12:17] carnal into eternity which interested
[12:22] 3:16 of the woman is there not a greater
[12:24] multiply life sorrow on that conception
[12:26] in sorrow thou shalt bring forth
[12:28] children and thy desire shall be to thy
[12:30] husband and he shall rule over thee so
[12:32] that's all part of this the same curse
[12:34] situation that we're in when you born
[12:36] again it's going to be a sorrowful thing
[12:38] I think you know what one of the things
[12:41] that was trying to prevent the word from
[12:43] coming to pass he's trying to prevent
[12:45] this Berta and he's trying to keep he
[12:47] wants to one of the sections of this day
[12:50] I believe it is to keep people from
[12:52] going through this sorrowful time like
[12:55] for example he tried to he tried to get
[12:59] Jesus to not go through
[13:01] turn-turn this bread and to turn these
[13:04] stones into bread
[13:04] you know just cast yourself down from
[13:06] the temple in herb I see real quick that
[13:08] a year who you say you are to bypass the
[13:11] sorrow you can't bypass the sorrow and
[13:14] and obviously being a Christian sometime
[13:16] any times as sorrow
[13:17] people will say stuff about you people
[13:20] do things that are hurtful and all that
[13:22] and and and another thing that sorrowful
[13:24] is just the process of coming out of
[13:26] your own creeds and ideas and you know
[13:30] you look around you can see a lot of the
[13:32] young people in this church kind of
[13:33] going through that process now if you
[13:35] talk to them they're theirs they're
[13:37] beginning to struggle with is that going
[13:38] through the same things that I struggle
[13:40] with when I
[13:40] young person I you know you become to
[13:43] this place where you're like this is
[13:45] this message true I've heard about it
[13:47] I've heard them talk about it everything
[13:49] but what makes this message different
[13:51] than a denomination because it looks
[13:54] like a lot of people are good people out
[13:56] there what what makes this different and
[14:00] so all of those things are it's a
[14:01] process of coming out and it's it's
[14:04] painful amen
[14:11] and that works sorrow if you look it up
[14:14] in the Strong's Concordance it means
[14:15] pain labor or our chips hora toil sorrow
[14:19] toil going on a pain hurt offence
[14:25] hardship and and what a birth really is
[14:28] if you look at it looking like this
[14:30] little picture of a womb where we're
[14:32] kind of in a compare this to the
[14:34] situation we're currently in we're
[14:37] walking around kind of in darkness not
[14:40] really having a full understanding of
[14:42] what's going on in our present condition
[14:44] also before you're born again you're in
[14:47] a in a dark dark world and the word is
[14:51] what's taking you from that transforming
[14:53] you from that darkness into light so if
[14:56] you look a little baby in his mama's
[14:57] tummy it's it goes through this this
[15:00] period of nine months there's a time to
[15:02] set in stone right you know everybody
[15:04] really they've got a time allotted to
[15:08] their life you don't know how much time
[15:10] that God has given you but you have a
[15:11] set amount of time that you here on on
[15:14] earth which is why the Bible says redeem
[15:16] the time because you want to make you
[15:18] want to maximize the time that you're
[15:20] given here on earth because you want to
[15:22] maximize the time to make to make a fish
[15:26] as efficient as possible during process
[15:28] we should be giving everything that we
[15:30] have everything we are to God so that he
[15:32] can make his word manifest in us because
[15:34] just like in this little room the God is
[15:37] transforming us to take us from darkness
[15:39] into light it's like a metamorphosis you
[15:43] might not be able to really see it if
[15:44] you're looking at just a woman's belly
[15:46] or a woman walking down the street
[15:48] this pregnant something on the inside of
[15:50] her is going on and then she yes it's
[15:54] true and has that as the process evolved
[15:58] is getting closer and closer to the time
[16:00] when that baby is going to come forth
[16:03] and and be presented to the world and
[16:07] what what happens when the baby is
[16:09] presented is that you know and like some
[16:11] of the old-timey movies and everything
[16:13] when you see a woman go into labor and
[16:15] and the baby is born the dads like
[16:17] nowhere to be seen
[16:18] he's out outside you know it was stress
[16:20] and everything but I don't believe
[16:22] that's how it is in the gospel you know
[16:24] because when a baby and the gospel is
[16:26] born the first thing that baby sees is
[16:28] the father isn't the father that's what
[16:31] that's what you see and that's why
[16:33] that's kind of what I'm getting to you
[16:35] because it could cry out Abba Father
[16:37] because you recognize who your God is
[16:44] and so you know the Bible teaches that
[16:46] that we have a mother because the Bible
[16:49] says that New Jerusalem is the mother of
[16:51] us all a New Jerusalem is the word that
[16:53] we're born from the word this it has to
[16:56] be this union that takes place that
[16:58] brings the birth we have to have the
[17:00] word and then it's very quick is it to
[17:02] bring life and then we're born and we
[17:04] come out if you come out of the womb so
[17:07] to speak and the first thing we see is
[17:10] the father and I'm getting ahead of
[17:14] myself in the slide and everything but I
[17:17] don't know where that slide here well
[17:21] let me talk about this then so we're
[17:23] going from one world to the next from
[17:26] one thing to the next and as you come
[17:28] forth from that world
[17:29] the father's got everything already
[17:32] planned for you he's got it all set up
[17:35] so as we go from this world to the next
[17:36] he's got everything planted you see this
[17:39] is what John 14 says let not your heart
[17:42] be troubled you believe in God believe
[17:43] also in me I in my father's house are
[17:45] many mansions if it were not so I would
[17:48] have told you I go to prepare a place
[17:49] for you so we know that he's preparing
[17:52] New Jerusalem that and a city that comes
[17:54] down
[17:54] God out of heaven but he's preparing
[17:56] after the new birth he's preparing he go
[17:59] he went so that he could prepare a place
[18:01] at a preparer prepare us in a growth so
[18:06] that we would grow up to to the word so
[18:10] just like a baby being born when it
[18:12] comes forth there's already all the
[18:14] little things setup all the little baby
[18:16] toys and everything's already set up and
[18:18] that's what God does for you when you're
[18:20] born when we're born from this world
[18:22] into the next everything you know like
[18:24] your your home over there your eternal
[18:26] home is program taught us that it's made
[18:28] according to your desires it's gonna be
[18:30] set up and I you know we can't even
[18:32] hardly imagine what it might be not even
[18:36] sure what my desires for a home might be
[18:38] but God news cuz he knows all of the all
[18:41] of our attributes what we want what we
[18:43] like everything so you know maybe one
[18:45] that will have a my wife always says I
[18:48] won't allow birds when I get over there
[18:49] she likes birds and she likes it look
[18:53] see all the birds at the bird feeder
[18:54] stuff so your home is gonna be prepared
[18:58] and so so we we come through this
[19:02] process of growing and struggle into
[19:04] life eternal
[19:05] so in Psalm David David had to sell a
[19:07] lot of these things because he you know
[19:09] as he was writing his songs and
[19:11] prophesying and so forth like in Psalms
[19:14] chapter six he says I'm weary with my
[19:15] growing all the night make out my bed to
[19:18] swim I water my counselor tears mine if
[19:21] my eyes consumed because of grief it
[19:23] waxeth old because of all my enemies
[19:25] depart from me all you workers of
[19:27] iniquity for the Lord I've heard the
[19:29] voice of my weeping why wouldn't they be
[19:31] growing why won't any of the Old
[19:33] Testament growing what are we growing in
[19:35] ourselves because we can't stay in this
[19:37] world and we're trying to get out of
[19:39] here and so something within you there's
[19:41] a dipascali to the deep to escape back
[19:45] excuse me to escape the shackles of this
[19:50] earth to get out of here I trust in
[19:54] Romans 8:26 27 it says likewise the
[19:57] spirit also helpeth our infirmities but
[20:00] we know not what we should pray for as
[20:02] we ought but the Spirit that is self
[20:04] maketh intercession for us with
[20:06] groanings which can
[20:07] be uttered and he has searched the hawks
[20:09] knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit
[20:11] because he maketh intercession for the
[20:12] Saints according to the will of God and
[20:15] all these speeches scriptures that just
[20:17] speak of this inward turmoil is groaning
[20:19] to get out of here
[20:22] Jesus therefore again groaning in
[20:25] himself and this is kind of where I'm
[20:27] going to use it is to the the difference
[20:30] between crying Abba Father and crying
[20:33] like Jesus did at the grave of Lazarus
[20:35] Lazarus come forth because those are
[20:38] both crying and so here Jesus was
[20:40] standing at the tomb of Lazarus and he
[20:43] said he was groaning in himself groaning
[20:46] because because there's there's gotta
[20:48] before a resurrection has to come you
[20:51] gotta have gasps cemani you gotta have a
[20:54] cross and the inner resurrection can
[20:56] come god I have a dying out you gotta
[20:58] have this groaning this situation this
[21:00] scenario of turmoil and something
[21:03] pressing out the word coming forth Jesus
[21:06] was standing there groaning himself
[21:08] coming to the Greenville's a cave and a
[21:10] stone lay upon you just like the stone
[21:12] that lay on his grain and jesus said
[21:15] take away the stone Martha the sister of
[21:17] in those dead sailor and him Lord by
[21:19] this time he's stinking for you been
[21:20] dead for days and so I'm getting to
[21:24] Lazarus come forth that's where I'm
[21:26] going but not yet and so you can see a
[21:31] Burt birth pains are irregular
[21:33] contractions contractions of the of the
[21:36] years contractions of the earth because
[21:38] the what what remember what the
[21:40] threefold purpose was to restore fallen
[21:43] Eden back to his condition and you can
[21:44] see that having any contractions of the
[21:46] world system everything is coming
[21:48] together that all the wars all the
[21:50] things that were promised I'd just like
[21:52] just before Jesus died all these
[21:54] prophecies all these things that begin
[21:56] to be fulfilled in rapid succession
[21:57] because it shows that something is about
[22:00] to happen there's gonna be there's gonna
[22:02] be twins born there's gonna be a bride
[22:04] form
[22:05] and there's gonna be something the world
[22:08] is coming together to and he saw the
[22:10] world's system all of these churches
[22:12] coming together they're uniting just
[22:14] like the bride as you know this birth
[22:17] pains all of this us contract it can
[22:19] happen together to produce God's Word
[22:22] and now we know we are aware the earth
[22:25] has just went through some great birth
[22:26] pains but I said that if you say this is
[22:28] and the church is going through some
[22:30] birth pains if I had to go through birth
[22:32] pains before to give each one of the
[22:34] prophets when they came into the world
[22:35] of the birth pain to the church
[22:37] the world had went through a First World
[22:39] War Second World War and now it's ready
[22:42] for a third world war and then send
[22:44] birth pains again but there's only one
[22:46] thing that could be bring peace and
[22:48] that's Christ now see what he's getting
[22:51] at here these birth pains are gonna
[22:54] produce Christ today they're not just to
[22:56] produce a lot of emotion or a lot of
[22:59] interesting situations for us to notice
[23:02] but it's producing the word made
[23:04] manifest you know a lot of times these
[23:06] little feasible there's so many of these
[23:08] little nuggets hidden in the message and
[23:12] it is wonderful and all of our schemes
[23:15] and our ideas and our pleas ESCO
[23:17] buildups and all of our politics and all
[23:19] of our science and everything it's been
[23:21] proved that it's nonsense and then we
[23:23] pray for God to help us to intervene
[23:24] come in and do something for us and then
[23:27] when he does I just wonder if we would
[23:30] be able to understand it if we would be
[23:31] able to receive it or even would we
[23:34] consider it so I think especially in
[23:36] this hour is it behooves us to pay
[23:38] attention to what's happening and
[23:40] realize what's taking place you know
[23:43] many of the message for many years and
[23:46] we believe that God sent a prophet and
[23:48] everything but what was the purpose of
[23:50] that prophet to come back the the
[23:51] purpose of the Prophet was to produce
[23:53] the word to preach in gospel that we
[23:55] would grab ahold of and eat until the
[23:57] word has made manifest in us and that's
[24:00] the only thing they could bring peace is
[24:02] Christ is that word main Memphis
[24:05] and then he talks about Israel that
[24:09] let's follow her heed her for the next
[24:11] ten minutes maybe Israel had birth pains
[24:13] under every prophet that came to the
[24:14] earth
[24:15] she had birth pains that has a message
[24:17] for what did they do the Prophet had the
[24:19] word and she had sown so much rottenness
[24:21] and make so much systematic orders in
[24:23] her being until this prophet shook her
[24:25] off of her foundation they were hated by
[24:28] everybody
[24:28] so therefore when God sent a prophet the
[24:30] church itself went into birth pains
[24:32] because the Prophet the word of the Lord
[24:35] comes to the Prophet and him only done
[24:37] it that is the word that spoken for that
[24:39] day is made manifest by the prophet of
[24:42] that age always has been and the
[24:44] churches they build so many systems
[24:46] around the world until he shook her off
[24:47] her rocker when he come she had birth
[24:50] pains
[24:50] what was it back to the word back to the
[24:53] life sometimes systems doesn't have a
[24:56] life it's only God's Word has life the
[24:58] systems that's built around it where
[25:00] does not have life it is the word that
[25:03] gives life his message brought in the
[25:05] remnant back to the word now you see
[25:08] really what he's talking about there's a
[25:10] you look at for patterns in the
[25:11] scripture there's a birth pains really
[25:14] if you look at a labor of birth pains
[25:16] don't come in the first month of the of
[25:18] the pregnancy birth pains happen at the
[25:20] end so you know if you look at this you
[25:23] can see that as each and during each age
[25:25] as Paul preached this message will say
[25:26] that's a birth pregnant
[25:27] right because he preached a message and
[25:29] out from that age came the people who
[25:32] believe the the bride from that age and
[25:34] through a process of birth and
[25:36] everything but all the way up this this
[25:38] church is the bride has been building up
[25:40] until we get here right when then the
[25:42] headstone is going to come and that
[25:44] produces what the the real birth pains
[25:47] well there's a big of somethings the
[25:49] baby's fixed to be born and again it's
[25:52] not a baby it's a full-grown man that's
[25:53] right which makes it a little bit
[25:55] difficult to express we're not talking
[25:57] about a baby we're talking about a fool
[25:59] little man that's coming forth and so
[26:01] this is the Prophet comes on the scene
[26:03] to bring it to turn the litter
[26:06] turn the hearts of the children and and
[26:08] and on all those things and and that's
[26:11] what when the Prophet begins to preach
[26:13] his word that's that's what produces all
[26:17] of the struggle and turmoil everything
[26:19] you know you look around and all the
[26:21] things that are happening in the world
[26:22] they're they're not we get our eyes so
[26:25] fixated on that what Donald Trump's
[26:27] doing and what oh you know Israel is
[26:30] doing and all those things but all those
[26:31] are happening because there's birth
[26:33] pangs in the bride and the bride is
[26:35] producing the work and because of that
[26:38] all of these other things happen as a
[26:41] consequence yeah
[26:43] just like look here's another that this
[26:47] is the real focus is that there's a
[26:48] little Mary and Joseph coming down into
[26:50] into Bethlehem and and she's going
[26:54] through this process where the birth
[26:56] pangs begin to strike she's riding on
[26:58] this little donkey and and the word is
[27:01] being born it's ready to be born and
[27:03] becoming that's that's really the focus
[27:06] is that Jesus Christ is coming into view
[27:09] to be made manifest so when a baby is
[27:13] born it storms off by crying right it
[27:16] starts off by crying out Abba Father so
[27:20] that's what I'm going to shift into for
[27:22] the next a little bit but what's the
[27:24] first thing come water if it isn't it's
[27:26] a dried birth to babies not normal say
[27:27] think blood that right what's the next
[27:29] thing life would come from Jesus water
[27:32] blood and life which you know he talks
[27:34] about we know that how a baby is born
[27:36] you got to have those three things and
[27:38] the third is what really when the baby
[27:40] comes out is born in his mom and daddys
[27:43] arms might not breathe breathing or
[27:45] whatever give it a little whack and all
[27:47] sudden it takes that first breath its
[27:49] life comes into it if it doesn't cry if
[27:52] it doesn't try out then there's no life
[27:54] so what does that mean to cry I think
[27:58] that that little definition of what
[28:00] crying is has been so misinterpreted
[28:03] everything you know lately I've been
[28:05] involved in lots of discussion about
[28:07] what interpreting is you know people
[28:09] people that they have said that
[28:11] ministers i haven't-- have the right to
[28:13] interpret the word which you know is
[28:14] true
[28:15] nobody can interpret the word to you to
[28:17] give you the correct interpretation the
[28:20] only one that can interpret the word to
[28:21] you is God by Jesus when he was talking
[28:24] to Peter and said flesh and blood didn't
[28:26] reveal this to you and my father in
[28:28] heaven revealed this to you but yeah
[28:30] you'd have to hear it priest so it has
[28:32] the the word has to comb through the
[28:35] bride tree it's got to be preached so
[28:37] that the father can quicken it to you to
[28:39] reveal to you exactly what it's talking
[28:41] about yeah so many so many different
[28:45] ways of looking at things but you know
[28:47] God is going to bring the correct
[28:49] interpretation to you if your wedding
[28:50] that's right
[28:52] and I'm convinced and I'm convicted that
[28:56] you cannot get it without the fivefold
[28:58] ministry nothing convinced more than
[28:59] ever that in a 1954 witnesses program
[29:07] said someone said the other day said
[29:09] brother Branham you believe God by faith
[29:11] abraham believed God by faith and that's
[29:12] all you can do there's no experience
[29:14] with it I said oh yes my brother what
[29:17] more can you do that believe God that's
[29:19] all you can name see but abraham
[29:21] believed God by faith he believed God
[29:23] and God gave him the confirmation of his
[29:25] faith about the sign of circumcision and
[29:27] so in other words after you believe you
[29:30] just keep holding on believe it hang on
[29:33] to the word and then God will confirm it
[29:35] to you by clicking again putting that
[29:36] alive in there there's a life is what
[29:38] we're after
[29:39] the life not just a lot of understanding
[29:41] a lot of knowledge and all that kind of
[29:42] thing but the actual life the power of
[29:45] God and you to transform you to bring
[29:48] about that metamorphosis that we were
[29:49] looking at the little baby growing and
[29:51] growing and growing that maybe it's
[29:53] hidden from view but all of a sudden
[29:55] that comes into view and you know when
[29:57] it comes into view might catch a lot of
[29:58] people by surprise
[29:59] oh my there's there's the bride made
[30:03] manifest now but again on the other hand
[30:07] it's a secret coming it's a secret thing
[30:09] a secret work that is not gonna be a
[30:11] public show I heard somebody say
[30:13] recently we you know when you look on
[30:15] YouTube or whatever and you see all
[30:17] these things that are being done around
[30:18] the world and faith healing and whatnot
[30:20] that's not the that was chrislam women I
[30:23] think yeah that's right that was good
[30:26] yeah yeah that's not the third pole cuz
[30:31] it's gonna be soon that's right a man
[30:35] can't join a church or get all emotional
[30:36] worked up or anything else and become a
[30:38] Christian it's gotta be a solid birth of
[30:40] the Spirit sincerely dying out crying
[30:42] out lying there - he's dead in Christ
[30:44] remember life can only come out of death
[30:47] a grain of corn if it abides at a bottle
[30:50] own it will never mean no more than that
[30:51] one grain of corn except a corn of wheat
[30:53] fall on the earth it abides alone but
[30:55] when it falls there it rots contaminates
[30:58] and out of that midst of corruption
[30:59] comes the germ of life that gives it
[31:01] life and produces more so you gotta have
[31:03] a die now and you gotta haven't got
[31:05] cemani and a cross before you can have a
[31:08] resurrection and I think a lot of times
[31:10] we leave those those pieces out we we
[31:13] come to church and we want a good
[31:14] intellectual conception a republic and
[31:16] instead of having a real dying out where
[31:19] we we say you know what maybe I was
[31:22] wrong to begin with and we really seek
[31:24] God for a revelation right because a
[31:26] birth is going to produce this baby just
[31:29] crying out alive baby this crying out
[31:35] Romans 8:15 this is what I'm getting to
[31:37] bro you have not received the spirit of
[31:40] bondage again to fear but you have
[31:42] received the spirit of adoption whereby
[31:44] we cry Abba Father and so when we cry
[31:49] when the baby is born is not just crying
[31:52] nothing like we think crying like just
[31:56] wow
[31:57] but this baby is crying Abba Father he's
[32:02] not just crying about something he don't
[32:04] know about I know now he is in baby form
[32:06] right so he he doesn't maybe not have
[32:09] the full understanding of a mature
[32:10] Christian that has been through some
[32:13] knocks and trials and hard things and
[32:15] has a little bad experience behind you
[32:16] but yeah the Word of God is being made
[32:20] manifest in him he's got the life in
[32:22] there and so he recognizes who his
[32:25] father is
[32:26] he's crying Abba Father and so when a
[32:29] baby is born in the gospel the first
[32:32] thing he sees is not not the preacher
[32:40] I'm not a man not somebody hit the first
[32:46] thing he sees is his father and that's
[32:49] what I believe every minister in the
[32:51] gospel is trying to get the people to
[32:55] see their father and you know what I
[32:59] really want to focus on this because I
[33:02] think so many in this day are not
[33:05] looking at their father they've got
[33:07] their eyes on brother branham or let's
[33:12] look at his son Joseph brain we'll just
[33:15] put that out there or in this church
[33:17] they've got their eyes on brother Dale
[33:18] right or way Dale or me or any of the
[33:22] ministries and that's not what your eyes
[33:25] supposed to be home right you're
[33:27] supposed to see your you're supposed to
[33:29] see your father reject and you know
[33:34] that's I just really wanna talk told how
[33:37] that that was one of the stumbling
[33:40] blocks that ministers were put in front
[33:42] of people they'll try to get people to
[33:44] them and they'll say look at all these
[33:46] gifts and all these things that I have
[33:49] or whatever and all the show by all the
[33:51] signs and wonders that are following
[33:53] their ministry
[33:54] whatever and everybody starts
[33:55] gravitating to that person that's what's
[33:57] happening now is that instead of seeing
[34:00] God the people are looking for some man
[34:03] Durazo they're looking for somebody to
[34:05] rise up to with some special thing or
[34:07] some special anointing or some new fancy
[34:11] doctor or something to rise up but
[34:13] what's going to take you in the rapture
[34:15] what gives you the new birth is is the
[34:19] father it's not it's not any particular
[34:22] man now of course we know the father is
[34:25] working through all the different
[34:26] ministers working through everybody and
[34:29] if you want to see God just like a news
[34:31] in the New Jerusalem if you want to see
[34:33] God you'll come up to remember the bride
[34:34] we know all those things but yet we
[34:37] don't follow after me and in that way
[34:40] where you say well I know I'm right
[34:43] because I go to this particular church
[34:45] well that that's a helpful and
[34:47] everything to go to a particular church
[34:48] but that's not what we base our
[34:50] salvation as we based our salvation on a
[34:54] personal revelation of who Jesus Christ
[34:57] is to you like in this picture this
[34:59] little baby is looking there's communion
[35:02] going on yeah there's something going on
[35:04] where it all the distractions have faded
[35:07] away this little baby is gazing straight
[35:09] into the face of his father and he might
[35:12] only have just a very basic
[35:14] understanding of what's going on here
[35:16] but he knows there's something happening
[35:18] there when you're born you begin to cry
[35:21] out Abba Father and it's not just some
[35:23] kind of vain cry and not or you don't
[35:26] really recourse eat but don't get me
[35:28] wrong you don't have a full
[35:29] understanding but you know you when
[35:32] you're born again the Bible becomes a
[35:34] new book
[35:35] because you begin to see your father
[35:37] unfold yes Matthew 23 892 the city they
[35:44] were never fired up by this he said but
[35:46] be not call rabbi for one is your master
[35:48] even Christ and all ye are brethren and
[35:50] call no man your father upon the earth
[35:52] for one is your father which is in him
[35:54] you know what that means that means that
[35:56] there's not any man they can give you a
[35:58] revelation we can lay it out there
[36:01] so and so that you've got the building
[36:03] blocks for if you just open up stood it
[36:07] out for yourself open yourself up or
[36:09] like with like the doors and door open
[36:11] my doors a pride all those doors up so
[36:13] that God can come in and quicken the
[36:15] word that you've heard but there's no
[36:17] man that your father and of course we
[36:20] give reverence to our earthly you know
[36:23] the ones that have helped us the ones
[36:24] that the Bible says in Hebrews 13:7 have
[36:27] the rule over us they help us and all
[36:30] those things that is not what we base
[36:33] our salvation on and the Misses
[36:41] identification he said and now God
[36:42] expresses himself through his son Christ
[36:45] Jesus as he takes us and it has adopted
[36:48] children and that's another thing that's
[36:50] a little bit confusing way to say yeah
[36:51] you're born again but he's calling you
[36:53] adopted sure because you came from the
[36:55] things of the world you know you're a
[36:57] Gentile a barbarian and you were you
[37:00] didn't have nothing to do with Israelite
[37:02] faith and so he adopted you that's why
[37:05] this is adoption and this is a different
[37:08] kind you pulled in from the things of
[37:12] this world and you're gonna adopt it
[37:13] into the kingdom of God and then you
[37:15] begin your heavenly journey as he takes
[37:18] us in as adopted children and put his
[37:20] spirit in us crying Abba Father see or
[37:23] in other words remind God my god see
[37:27] then the Holy Spirit in us Christ's
[37:28] spirit expressing Jesus Christ and the
[37:30] people
[37:31] look at you the things that are to be he
[37:33] said we have become from mortal beings
[37:35] from time being an eternal beings when
[37:37] the Word of God in our souls and we
[37:39] become sons and daughters of God with
[37:41] the attributes the gene of God in us to
[37:43] be sons and daughters of the father God
[37:45] and heaven crying I have a father my God
[37:47] my god
[37:48] in my father's house so yeah I want to
[37:56] just kind of put emphasis on this
[37:57] because I think so many times we think
[37:59] that I'm gonna be born again because I
[38:01] just cry out or whatever because I cry
[38:03] within the divinity of my own mind just
[38:06] having no understanding of the word
[38:07] that's one of the deceptions of the
[38:09] enemies that you don't have to
[38:10] understand because brother Branham said
[38:12] just believe it you have to understand
[38:14] it just believe it well that's true but
[38:16] one day God is gonna quicken it to you
[38:19] you will have understanding not because
[38:21] you studied a lot because God revealed
[38:23] it to you but studying a lot is part of
[38:26] it's all it's all part of the process
[38:27] that's right you need to you need to
[38:29] read the Bible you need to listen to the
[38:30] tapes but there's many people that have
[38:32] listened to the tapes and and have their
[38:34] own carnal interpretation it must be
[38:37] revealed and when it's revealed to you
[38:39] then you'll see the father but married
[38:43] with that baby in our homes that didn't
[38:44] make any difference where they thought
[38:45] she knowed whose son that was and that's
[38:48] what I'm getting in she knows so you
[38:50] know who that was just like you do when
[38:53] he's born in you you'll know who he is
[38:56] and so has every believer that accepts
[38:58] God word in their heart I don't care
[38:59] what the system say I know for and so
[39:02] forth he says it's crying she's in
[39:04] travail the church is then to bring
[39:06] forth little ones crying my God my God
[39:09] see I'm a father so let's look at what
[39:14] the definition of this word is and I got
[39:15] like two minutes cry we cry and the
[39:20] Greek lexicon the Strong's Concordance
[39:21] it says and I'm gonna what I'm gonna do
[39:23] I'm doing is comparing this word cry we
[39:26] cry Abba Father to Jesus when he cried
[39:29] with a loud voice Lazarus come forth
[39:30] because those two words are related
[39:33] cry and this sense is a lesser form of
[39:36] cried with a loud voice
[39:37] they both
[39:38] and agree they're both people that they
[39:41] both come from the same root word too so
[39:45] this word means to cry cry out aloud
[39:48] speak with a loud voice and then in John
[39:52] 11 it says he cried with a loud voice
[39:54] and if you look at I thought I'd written
[39:59] down where I've got this from this Bible
[40:01] dictionary and it's a stronger form of
[40:04] what we just read cry crying Abba Father
[40:07] so it's a higher form so you're crying
[40:10] there's two to cries but there that one
[40:14] is a and more mature of state and then
[40:18] the other but they're both not just
[40:21] crying for no reason but they're
[40:23] speaking the word they're making a
[40:25] confession they're saying the same thing
[40:27] you see yeah and the Lord said unto
[40:32] Moses were for Christ and then down unto
[40:34] me this isn't the one we will that
[40:35] brother Branham talked about a why cry
[40:38] speak this is a different kind of cry
[40:41] this is crying out for help crying out
[40:43] and distress to make outcry clamor to be
[40:47] someone to cry and grief like you don't
[40:49] know you're in confusion you don't know
[40:51] what's going on you're like oh god help
[40:53] me but this is a different kind of cry
[40:55] then cry Abba Father or crying with a
[40:58] loud voice which is the mortar form of
[41:02] crying Abba Father remember we're not
[41:04] just crying for no reason we're crying
[41:06] Abba Father because you know you're
[41:09] beginning to see who God is and imma
[41:11] have to stop right there because that's
[41:14] that's all the time
[41:16] [Music]
