[4:06] about you forgive our sins cleanse us
[4:09] from all unrighteousness and keep us in
[4:11] Jesus name
[4:13] amen
[4:16] Romans
[4:18] 8 28. and we know that all things work
[4:21] together for good to them that love God
[4:24] to them who are the called according to
[4:25] his purpose
[4:27] for whom he did for no he also did
[4:29] predestinate to be conformed to the
[4:32] image of his son that he might be the
[4:34] firstborn among many Brethren moreover
[4:37] whom he did predestinate than he also
[4:40] called and whom he called them he also
[4:42] justified in whom he justified them he
[4:45] also glorified what shall we then say to
[4:47] these things if God be for us who can be
[4:51] against us
[4:52] let's go to
[4:57] Genesis 1 26.
[5:00] and God said let us make man in our
[5:02] image after our likeness and let them
[5:05] have dominion over the fish of the sea
[5:06] and over the fowl of the hour and over
[5:09] the Catalan over all of the earth and
[5:11] over ever creeping thing that creepeth
[5:13] upon the Earth
[5:14] so God created man in his in on image in
[5:17] the image of God created he him male and
[5:21] female created he them you may be seated
[5:24] the Lord had his Blessing to the reading
[5:27] of the word
[5:28] now remember
[5:31] as we get on into the part of talking in
[5:34] a little bit that God created
[5:38] you know
[5:40] them they
[5:43] Adam and Eve as we call it male and
[5:45] female as we called it but keep that in
[5:48] mind and don't think about that that
[5:50] there was just one part there and we'll
[5:51] try to get to that you know and try to
[5:54] understand now we spent a lot of time
[5:57] talking about
[5:59] predestination and how that it's by
[6:02] God's foreknowledge
[6:04] in those who he did for no he could
[6:06] predestinate
[6:08] and now we're still as far as our
[6:11] thoughts and our concept of the poor
[6:14] we're talking we're still back in uh the
[6:18] eternities
[6:19] and coming out tonight and coming down
[6:22] you know we've had a little company
[6:24] lately so we had to kind of change
[6:25] things around I don't mind that
[6:27] sometimes I think it's very needful for
[6:30] even you here for me to back up and and
[6:33] review some things and and then we'll
[6:36] try to carry on with the with the
[6:38] thought but I hope it's in instilled in
[6:40] your mind enough by now to what we've
[6:44] read and what we've we've talked about
[6:46] that
[6:48] God is revealing himself
[6:52] it's not a condescending or a coming
[6:56] down of God
[6:58] is you know that's wordings that we use
[7:03] but it's really God revealing himself
[7:08] to mankind
[7:10] and as he reveals himself to mankind see
[7:12] these things were a hidden Mystery
[7:16] man probed at it you could get certain
[7:19] things you could study things as
[7:21] Scholars could bring out wordings and
[7:23] and Mankind could speak on it but it was
[7:26] a hidden Mystery until the end time to
[7:29] be revealed in this last days and we
[7:32] thank God that he sent us a prophet to
[7:34] where the word of the Lord could come to
[7:36] him and we could receive things that
[7:39] even a man with great abilities is pro
[7:43] Gap
[7:44] and you know the Bible even says that
[7:46] the prophets desired to look into the
[7:48] things that you and I see amen the
[7:51] things we talk about as simple things of
[7:53] one God and different things like that
[7:55] the the prophets desired to look into
[7:58] those things you know and we're chosen
[8:01] to bring what they could but yet they
[8:03] could not bring it all into fullness but
[8:06] then it would wind up in the end time
[8:07] that God would send a prophet to be able
[8:10] to show us these things and we could do
[8:13] as he said that we've used off a Christ
[8:15] a mystery that he could go back into the
[8:18] back part of God's mind
[8:19] and speak of the things that were sealed
[8:22] up before the foundation of the world
[8:24] and speak to you and I and they become
[8:27] common
[8:28] everyday language I guess you'd call it
[8:31] to you and I because it's things that we
[8:34] talk about that you know that is simple
[8:37] to us
[8:39] and uh you know in doing that we've had
[8:41] 40 something years to study a prophet's
[8:44] message so we ought to at least have a
[8:46] little bit of understanding you know and
[8:49] uh it uh it would be a shame to be based
[8:52] to base it on the fact that we didn't
[8:54] know
[8:55] because we've had so much of a time and
[8:58] an opportunity to be able to understand
[9:01] but now we spent a good bit of time
[9:04] talking about
[9:06] how that God is revealing himself to
[9:10] mankind
[9:11] and as he's doing that he's bringing
[9:14] forth his attributes
[9:16] his uh nature his ways his being
[9:22] and coming down to you know to where we
[9:25] can understand and and just taking a
[9:27] simple prophet's message you know and
[9:30] talk about how that Our God dwelt Alone
[9:34] but then from him came forth a form of
[9:38] God not another God
[9:41] but a part of God went out that would be
[9:44] called logos theophany uh Holy Spirit
[9:48] it would even be called a son of God
[9:52] but yet he didn't definitely believe in
[9:55] Eternal sonship so it's not dealing with
[9:57] that see it's the Eternal God
[10:01] revealing himself in another form
[10:05] just as we are father son human many
[10:10] forms of us
[10:12] but we're only one person right right
[10:14] it's being made known and it can't be
[10:17] made known all at once you know I mean
[10:19] when when brother dick there was was a
[10:22] baby laying in the Cradle all he could
[10:24] do was call him a baby
[10:26] he couldn't uh uh there wasn't no
[10:30] granddaddy there
[10:32] you know in him
[10:34] it was Debbie and him daddy had brought
[10:36] him into the world then you say well his
[10:38] DNA was back in granddaddy that's fine
[10:41] but it brought him into the world well
[10:44] he couldn't do anything
[10:45] there he was not a father
[10:49] he was not a grandfather he was not a
[10:52] husband
[10:54] and we had the form of being a baby
[10:57] all right
[10:58] see then as time
[11:01] brought to pass
[11:04] he and morphed from one form to the
[11:07] other
[11:09] going but it was the same person
[11:12] not many people there's not many gods
[11:15] just one God
[11:16] but he's unveiling himself
[11:21] get the message the unveiling of God and
[11:24] then listen right after then to the
[11:26] Mighty God unveiled
[11:28] and put those together and listen to
[11:31] what he's talking about
[11:33] you see it's like I've told you now we
[11:36] believe in God
[11:38] not
[11:39] uh say
[11:42] moving as much as revealing himself
[11:47] he's revealing himself because we're
[11:49] looking back there we can't see logos
[11:52] we can't seek theophany
[11:55] we can't see the Son of God that went
[11:57] out right
[11:58] you can only see it by Supernatural eye
[12:01] and that would only be by way of the
[12:04] Prophet because the word comes to the
[12:06] prophet you can say well I saw him back
[12:08] there as a baby well that that might be
[12:10] true
[12:11] but remember the word comes to the
[12:14] prophet all right
[12:16] but now
[12:17] looking at it then we see that
[12:22] God is
[12:27] he's a supernatural being
[12:30] and how can you explain the supernatural
[12:32] being
[12:33] but
[12:34] you can't even comprehend a supernatural
[12:37] being unless you become one right
[12:40] right
[12:41] I mean wouldn't it be something for us
[12:43] to walk up to Einstein and try to tell
[12:45] him how to
[12:47] you know
[12:49] run a light bulb and make it
[12:52] that'd be something wouldn't it
[12:55] well you wouldn't even have time fool
[12:56] with you because you know
[12:59] but yet somebody that could comprehend
[13:01] what he was talking about
[13:05] I heard the story told said it wasn't
[13:07] but one man and he was an old drunk that
[13:09] hung around with him and you know said
[13:11] he could kind of follow him because why
[13:13] because I mean who can talk to a man
[13:16] that says if you're standing here
[13:19] and you're looking out that way and
[13:21] you're looking that way with unlimited
[13:23] eyesight
[13:24] you see the back of your head
[13:28] yes boy that's crazy
[13:30] you know I might see a long ways but you
[13:33] know
[13:34] see you couldn't comprehend what he'd be
[13:37] talking about
[13:38] and that's the way God is but yet take
[13:41] Mankind and down through the uh
[13:44] abilities of teachers in school and and
[13:47] then you get into what is the word
[13:49] physics and and and all of those things
[13:52] you get into all of that by the teachers
[13:54] and gradually it unfolds
[13:58] of what Einstein was talking about well
[14:02] that's simply what we're trying to do in
[14:04] studying the message of our the Bible
[14:06] the prophet's message
[14:08] is to understand him as he begins to
[14:13] reveal himself
[14:15] bring himself into a a form
[14:21] that you and I can comprehend
[14:24] see then it's not another God it's the
[14:27] same God revealing himself all right now
[14:32] see we talked about that little white
[14:34] light
[14:37] and how
[14:38] the first that went out from God was a
[14:41] logos
[14:42] he calls it the anointing go ahead with
[14:45] number one questions and answers on
[14:47] Genesis paragraph 28.
[14:51] and look what he calls it he said we're
[14:53] standing on the banisters
[14:55] watching now that's just wordings right
[14:59] watching what God's doing
[15:01] meaning we're we're seeing by by
[15:05] the eye of the Holy Spirit
[15:08] because you cannot see
[15:10] any other way right
[15:12] the things that are back there all right
[15:14] now so we're standing on the banister
[15:17] watching
[15:18] and the question and things about brains
[15:20] said no man has seen God
[15:22] and now the next thing we begin to see
[15:24] by eyes are Supernatural
[15:26] looking we see a little white light
[15:28] forming out there what is that that was
[15:31] called by Bible readers blow gosh
[15:35] are the anointed or the anointing
[15:39] or the as I was going to say the part of
[15:44] God began to develop into something so
[15:47] human beings could have some type of an
[15:50] idea what it was it was a little
[15:54] low a little light
[15:58] moving he that was the word of God
[16:02] now God gave himself birth
[16:06] to this son
[16:09] watch which was before there was ever an
[16:12] atom
[16:13] you know or anything like that
[16:15] and Jesus said glorify me with the glory
[16:18] that I had with thee before the
[16:19] foundation world
[16:21] God has given birth to a son
[16:24] but now that son remember is God in
[16:27] another form
[16:29] not another God not a second person
[16:32] it's God in another form called a son
[16:35] logos anointing but good to it in a
[16:39] minute
[16:41] to where did he'll use the word
[16:42] theophany
[16:43] all right
[16:45] but we're not trying to show how smart
[16:47] we are by words
[16:50] we're trying to comprehend an eternal
[16:52] God
[16:54] that the Bible said it could be
[16:55] understood
[16:59] that the prophet would go tell a simple
[17:01] illustration
[17:03] you know you're a father you're a human
[17:05] you're a person
[17:07] and there it unveils the godhead
[17:09] the great thing that's been a mystery to
[17:12] mankind
[17:13] can be revealed by simple terminologies
[17:15] if we take that and allow the Holy
[17:19] Spirit
[17:21] but remember now the Bible is not
[17:24] written
[17:25] to the world it's not written to sinners
[17:29] it's only written to the people who have
[17:32] the Holy Spirit the inside teacher right
[17:35] you can have the outside teacher all
[17:37] your life and not do any good look at
[17:39] gamalia and Nicodemus and all of them
[17:41] you know
[17:44] all the great that they had but they
[17:46] couldn't comprehend
[17:48] but yet we don't even have an education
[17:51] you know at all compared to theirs and
[17:55] yet we can understand God
[17:57] but remember now he reveals to whom he
[18:00] wants to be wants to reveal
[18:03] that's not uh some kind of a
[18:07] predetermining to choose certain that's
[18:09] a fact that he knew who would
[18:14] so now we've done been through all of
[18:16] that it's not just all of the doings
[18:18] we're not through with predestination
[18:20] don't forget that because we've got to
[18:23] get down out of the eternities and down
[18:25] on earth into a a form of mankind in the
[18:30] natural before we can even talk about
[18:31] predestination right
[18:35] because where we're at now we're in the
[18:38] eternities talking about the Eternal God
[18:42] and seeing how that that God he
[18:46] he was lonely
[18:50] right
[18:52] he was lonely
[18:54] he had attributes in him
[18:56] he desired those attributes to be
[18:59] known
[19:01] he desired to be a father he desired to
[19:04] be a Healer he desired to be all of
[19:06] those things for you and I
[19:11] and just think about it
[19:13] we are now fulfilling
[19:15] that desire
[19:18] it has been being fulfilled down through
[19:20] time we know that
[19:22] but yet we are in the end time when it's
[19:25] all going to be made known
[19:28] what a wonderful opportunity
[19:31] to sit here and understand the Bible and
[19:35] it unfolds all right
[19:37] now go ahead with number two because we
[19:39] were on this one the message we've used
[19:41] these quotes but of some of it but
[19:46] I just want us to think about some
[19:47] things
[19:49] now prior to this in the paragraph
[19:51] before he's explaining that God is
[19:53] created the animals the leaves the trees
[19:56] that they
[19:58] so paragraph 51 so he couldn't just
[20:01] leave it in that state see in other
[20:03] words he had a world he had a the
[20:05] animals he had everything
[20:08] but he couldn't leave it in that state
[20:10] so he said let us plural make man plural
[20:16] now what if he'd have said
[20:18] let me singular
[20:21] make man plural
[20:25] that wouldn't work would it
[20:27] that would not be in His image
[20:31] right or if he said let us
[20:34] make man singular
[20:40] you see when you you started out and
[20:42] saying well I'm gonna get through in a
[20:43] hurry tonight
[20:44] I'm gonna run through these quotes
[20:46] tonight and get through this
[20:48] because I've had these quotes laying and
[20:50] they have back there
[20:52] two weeks now or more this is part three
[20:55] I guess
[20:56] that we're on this I mean on the part
[20:59] but look what he says let us plural make
[21:02] man plural in our own image
[21:06] and let us make man in our own image
[21:10] so then
[21:11] when God made his first man
[21:15] he was a spirit man
[21:17] look he was something on the order of
[21:21] God
[21:22] or the son of God
[21:28] the Lord gosh
[21:29] that was the first man
[21:31] then he gave this man jurisdiction over
[21:34] see that to lead to all the animals
[21:37] just like the Holy Spirit leads the
[21:39] believer today
[21:41] now think of this in a little bit
[21:43] he gives his spiritual man rule over the
[21:47] animals but when man is made in physical
[21:52] he is a ruler of the animals
[21:55] he's the god of the Earth
[21:58] right right
[21:59] all right but see he makes man in a
[22:04] with a spirit man he was something on
[22:06] the order of God or the Son of God the
[22:09] little god well because that's who he
[22:10] was
[22:13] he never took something else and made a
[22:15] son that's what we think about
[22:17] we think that the the part that we're
[22:19] talking about let us make man we'll get
[22:22] to it later on in the message
[22:24] or that run around and said he didn't
[22:25] make man
[22:27] you know like one man he made
[22:31] not all mankind after this one way right
[22:37] he never made all mankind after his own
[22:40] image
[22:44] come on
[22:45] he never made all mankind after his own
[22:47] image
[22:50] he made one man
[22:55] the man Christ Jesus
[22:58] right simple terminologies
[23:01] not the man Jesus the flesh the man
[23:05] Christ Jesus
[23:08] who created all things
[23:11] and by him was all things made
[23:15] he was the creator what the son of God
[23:20] civil terminologies yet we we we cut
[23:23] ourselves off see because we thought
[23:25] well we just can't understand it
[23:28] just wait a little while
[23:30] and they didn't speak to you
[23:33] but you see if God was a logos
[23:36] if God was the anointed or the anointing
[23:39] or what he
[23:41] then
[23:43] what is this man that he makes
[23:49] this is not the physical creation of man
[23:53] that happens in Genesis 2.
[23:57] which takes place in Genesis 1 at the
[24:00] end of the sixth day of the creation of
[24:02] animals and life all right
[24:06] we haven't got down to speaking of the
[24:08] natural man being created
[24:10] we're still talking about the spiritual
[24:12] man
[24:16] and by looking at that we see
[24:21] that
[24:23] God never
[24:25] predestinated anything wrong
[24:29] amen we haven't even dealt with dealt
[24:33] with him
[24:34] as predestinating yet
[24:40] he never predestinated
[24:43] this uh son to come into being
[24:48] right
[24:54] then if he created man in that image he
[24:57] never predestinated that
[24:59] right
[25:03] that was his desire that was his whole
[25:05] thing
[25:07] you see why I do believe in eternal life
[25:12] I do believe that eternal life you have
[25:15] received by the new birth always was
[25:19] eternal and is a part of God
[25:23] it's God in another form amen amen
[25:25] called a son a bride a wife a many many
[25:29] titles
[25:31] can be laid upon the children The
[25:33] Offspring
[25:38] see because this spiritual man wasn't
[25:41] made on the sixth day
[25:45] spiritual man was made before the
[25:46] foundation of the world right
[25:50] that was one of the morning stars that
[25:51] signed together the sons of gods are
[25:53] shout for joy
[25:55] that's why Jesus could say
[25:57] I knew you
[26:00] before the world
[26:02] well that's pretty that's that's
[26:03] predetermined no that ain't Predator we
[26:06] ain't even got any to it yet
[26:08] we ain't got to the predetermining
[26:11] redetermining his Earthly matters
[26:17] come on predetermining his Earthly
[26:19] situation
[26:21] time existence
[26:27] I'm still talking about the Eternal God
[26:32] and to see
[26:34] that if he made a man
[26:37] in that image
[26:39] and we saw Sunday there
[26:41] in the message
[26:43] from Blasphemous names
[26:46] that when he did put Adam into flesh he
[26:49] breathed into his nostrils
[26:51] eternal life
[26:53] now Adam never came with eternal life
[27:03] Adam was standing there the prophet said
[27:07] and God breathed into his nostrils
[27:12] amen eternal life
[27:15] he said church I haven't got to that
[27:17] because we'll go back to it when we get
[27:18] to it go on through Blasphemous names
[27:20] and listen to him where he said Church
[27:24] borned by the Breath of God
[27:27] like Adam was breathed into his nostrils
[27:32] and he become a living soul
[27:34] he said he breathed on the day of
[27:36] Pentecost
[27:39] into the Bride of Jesus Christ
[27:42] eternal life
[27:44] you see it's hard to keep from going on
[27:47] that way
[27:48] and I put in enough to where that at
[27:51] least those listening
[27:53] won't just keep running a channel
[27:56] and think well he don't know what he's
[27:57] talking about he said well I know I
[27:59] don't know what I'm talking about but I
[28:00] know a God that knows what he's talking
[28:02] about
[28:03] and that's who I'm dependent on right
[28:06] but look what he says on the next one
[28:08] now remember it
[28:10] let us plural make man plural
[28:16] do whatever you want to call it whatever
[28:18] words you want to use he made a two-part
[28:21] man or whatever you want to call it
[28:24] Adam in the natural was male and female
[28:28] but in his spiritual creation
[28:36] said let them
[28:40] now
[28:42] hold on real careful
[28:46] Eve was in Adam
[28:48] right agree to that
[28:51] and we'll get to it in a little while
[28:52] that she was in him in theophany
[28:55] but just remember
[28:58] if that theophany had eternal life
[29:00] that's the eternal life you and I must
[29:03] have
[29:07] okay
[29:09] hold on to that point
[29:10] so look what he says
[29:14] this is taken from George to Father 1953
[29:17] 16 uh
[29:19] paragraph e65 and when he made
[29:22] everything that looked nice and good to
[29:24] him now he said let us plural make man
[29:26] plural and own image what was he he was
[29:28] a supernatural being
[29:30] so what did he create a supernatural
[29:32] being right okay
[29:34] there's the one that could not be seen
[29:38] God the father never was seen never will
[29:42] be seen he'll never be seen as what we
[29:45] want to look at him
[29:50] he'll be standing there we'll know who
[29:52] that is
[29:54] we'll know that's the father
[29:57] why because that's the revelation
[30:00] all right
[30:03] and there he is and now here's the son
[30:05] what
[30:06] which is a logos that went out of him
[30:08] Made In His Image supernatural being
[30:11] that went out in the beginning
[30:15] now
[30:17] you can argue and say well he's talking
[30:19] about that that went out of him the
[30:22] amorphy to come forth that's fine it's a
[30:24] supernatural being but look where he
[30:26] goes right to
[30:28] let's make man in our image actor
[30:31] he made a man in his own image
[30:34] he made a supernatural being
[30:36] yes indeed Genesis 1 28 I'll get to that
[30:39] scripture later
[30:42] read and see if that isn't right and
[30:45] then when he made man in his own image
[30:46] he had rule over the Beast he led the
[30:49] beasts around then like the Holy Spirit
[30:51] supposed to lead to church today
[30:53] he's leading us go on to the next
[30:58] number four which is taken from who is
[31:00] God
[31:02] that's a good message to listen to the
[31:03] whole message of course all of them's
[31:05] good to listen to
[31:07] right on what we're talking about
[31:10] E20 1958 15 who is God
[31:14] then we're going to make this second man
[31:16] I want you
[31:18] the first man you can't see him now he
[31:21] just said to take before that we read
[31:24] that you couldn't see the father
[31:27] all right we have used on a message the
[31:31] other day where brought around and said
[31:32] God's first creation was himself
[31:37] then out of him went to logos
[31:39] it's simply showing and revealing God
[31:42] all right
[31:44] the first man you can't see him he's God
[31:47] second man was a Halo there's your your
[31:51] uh Speech coming out now he takes a
[31:54] third man
[31:55] it makes him like a little white cloud
[31:59] coming over we can see him Holy Spirit
[32:02] coming down and he's all man that's the
[32:06] soul of man
[32:08] Eternal then
[32:09] huh
[32:12] yeah
[32:14] there's never been but one Soul eternal
[32:20] amen so you can see what we're talking
[32:21] about
[32:24] the Genesis 1 26 and 27 man is one man
[32:29] the soul
[32:31] of almighty God the theophany the logos
[32:35] the speech the all in all amen dividing
[32:39] himself
[32:41] into
[32:44] a multiple form of him
[32:52] making it to Christ
[32:54] all right
[32:56] let's go on just a little
[32:59] so now remember what we're talking about
[33:03] God
[33:05] the way he come into being
[33:07] talking about how man comes into being
[33:10] because man is made in the image of God
[33:15] all right
[33:18] and look what he says
[33:21] look at number five
[33:24] questions and answers on Genesis 53 7 29
[33:27] paragraph 43.
[33:30] he got all those things together and
[33:31] made and made all the other things all
[33:33] the animal life the birds the bees the
[33:35] monkeys and whatever it was put them all
[33:37] here on Earth and then he asked this
[33:39] question let us who
[33:43] let us who
[33:47] father and son
[33:51] word and spirit
[33:54] almighty God revealing himself huh
[33:57] make man in our own image now if a man
[34:00] was made something like that little
[34:02] sacred light Yonder or something like
[34:04] that it could not be seen which is a
[34:07] spiritual being
[34:08] he manifests or unfolds himself down a
[34:11] little more and to make a trinity of
[34:13] himself a father Son and Holy Ghost our
[34:16] solar spirit and there was God in
[34:18] himself now down into now God unfolding
[34:21] himself
[34:22] this is not coming of me and you
[34:25] he says not this we're talking about
[34:28] this is not Samuel Dale you're talking
[34:31] about
[34:34] this is the Christ the low gospel Son of
[34:36] God
[34:39] the image of who that were to be made
[34:44] here was God unfolding himself now into
[34:46] let us make man which was his son and
[34:49] Offspring on him man in our own image he
[34:52] was a supernatural being
[34:54] and let him have dominion over the
[34:56] cattles in the fields and so forth now I
[34:59] love this part look what he said the
[35:01] voice of God out there
[35:03] the voice of man rather
[35:09] watch him
[35:10] would speak and say call the cattle this
[35:13] way call the Sheep over this pastor call
[35:16] the fishes to the water
[35:18] so he had Dominion everything obeyed him
[35:22] what about the voice of God
[35:24] the voice of man
[35:28] the voice of man is that God but around
[35:30] him said
[35:32] you take a born-again Christian take the
[35:36] word of God place it on his lips and
[35:39] speak it he said it's deity speaking
[35:42] right
[35:44] yes amen
[35:47] you see where we're living so far below
[35:48] our privileges I said we all of us
[35:52] are living below our privileges they
[35:55] shouldn't be a sick one in this building
[35:56] tonight
[36:00] I blame myself as much as you the only
[36:03] thing I know I can do
[36:06] I told you years ago any preacher can
[36:09] preach if you want a Revival in just
[36:13] making you jump up and down and shout
[36:14] and run out I can preach it
[36:16] if you want healing to take place
[36:19] and just healing I can preach it
[36:24] if you want salvation just for the
[36:26] children
[36:28] I can preach it
[36:32] well brother that we need well let's put
[36:33] them all together
[36:35] right
[36:37] and that way we're not stopping on one
[36:39] thing
[36:43] because with the restoration of the word
[36:44] what
[36:46] comes a restoration of Power with the
[36:49] restoration of the word comes what
[36:52] the Sons and Daughters of the Living God
[36:54] to speak the word of God the
[36:56] manifestation of the Sons and Daughters
[36:58] of God
[37:00] see we can approach it from one way I'm
[37:02] telling you
[37:04] and you know the reason I can tell you
[37:06] that I watch it of these preachers that
[37:09] are out there
[37:11] and I go home and weep and cry
[37:16] I see these preachers that can get
[37:18] people to the pulpit and get them to
[37:21] Salvation
[37:23] I see preachers that can get healing
[37:30] don't you
[37:34] signs and wonders taking place
[37:40] and I'm not saying that's wrong I'm
[37:42] saying it's all right
[37:46] but that's not the full manifestation
[37:51] that's not what you and I are supposed
[37:53] to be dealing with
[37:56] that's right we're supposed to be coming
[37:58] taking the word and speaking God's word
[38:05] and that's where we're all failing
[38:09] well brother Dale I wish we were that
[38:10] well I wish we could have a little
[38:13] I don't have enough time to slow down
[38:15] I'm sorry
[38:18] if I'm wrong you can get you another
[38:20] Pastor anytime you want it
[38:22] I'm just me
[38:24] and I've seen it 40 years ago and I've
[38:27] hammered at it ever since
[38:29] and any of you that's ever been here
[38:31] with me you know that's what I've done
[38:33] is hammered at the opening of the word
[38:35] the revealing of God's word
[38:38] trying to get you and I to see that word
[38:40] and stand there and let that word inside
[38:42] of us speak out
[38:48] and see it even create
[38:52] we've seen the dead raised
[38:54] we've seen the sick healed
[39:01] would you think well all you ought to do
[39:02] brother Dale brother dick here he's he's
[39:04] on up in age he'd like me to preach him
[39:07] back to a young man
[39:09] well the only way I know to do it just
[39:10] keep on going the way I am
[39:14] you think I don't love my wife and and
[39:16] don't cry when I hear her screaming in
[39:19] pain
[39:24] but yet I've got to keep on preaching
[39:25] when I'm preaching amen
[39:27] because within that is the healing
[39:30] and that is the new birth and that is
[39:32] the chain to the body
[39:40] you think I don't think false
[39:43] I try to Pastor a group of people
[39:46] and to get them to see God
[39:51] but it's just like I told Brother Carly
[39:52] years ago I said brother call him my
[39:54] goal
[39:55] we was coming back out of South Carolina
[39:58] and I said my goal
[40:00] is to preach to you the word of God
[40:03] that if something goes wrong that you
[40:05] can't find brother Dale brother mold or
[40:07] whatever that you'll be able to stand on
[40:11] the word of God
[40:15] that's my desire
[40:18] to preach the word
[40:21] to look into the things the prophet said
[40:23] and go into the things that others are
[40:25] scared
[40:26] to speak about
[40:29] evidently they must be scared they don't
[40:30] speak about it
[40:34] I don't have a back lord of sermons you
[40:36] know laying down
[40:42] okay forgive me
[40:46] forgive me for being me that's when I
[40:49] told my wife one day I was only just
[40:51] forgive me for being me
[40:53] she said how am I going to forgive you
[40:55] for being you
[40:57] she didn't know what I meant
[41:00] yeah I mean I just what I am
[41:02] and forgive me you know okay
[41:05] let's go on to the next one
[41:13] what was God
[41:16] all right
[41:20] if we're going to be in the image of God
[41:21] what was God
[41:24] all right now we're going to get to
[41:25] something in a minute that you're gonna
[41:27] wake up a little bit or close me off one
[41:32] see I believe
[41:34] that God can be here tonight in many
[41:36] forms
[41:39] and just be one God
[41:42] he can be here to heal he can be here to
[41:45] save he can be here to deliver he can be
[41:48] many many forms and yet still be that
[41:52] one God
[41:56] now we're going to talk about God being
[41:57] a theophany
[42:01] now remember in Webster's and things
[42:04] you'll find the word theophany will be
[42:06] dealing with really a body of a deity
[42:10] you know that's as good as you can come
[42:12] up with
[42:15] but
[42:16] think about what happened
[42:20] when that great Eternal God
[42:24] the self-existing
[42:27] revealed himself as
[42:30] not moving over into another form or a
[42:33] part of him went out like an arm
[42:35] slinging off
[42:38] but yet he simply
[42:40] in Morpheus
[42:42] into another form
[42:46] and he's a little white light the
[42:47] prophet says
[42:49] he's a Halo
[42:53] he's a logos speech
[42:58] but now listen
[43:02] he's done this this way we didn't so
[43:06] there's no argument with him
[43:10] he had to take a form there
[43:12] to be able to speak
[43:19] so he stepped forth in a theophany
[43:25] he had a body
[43:28] that's what I told you I really enjoyed
[43:30] down at the Passion Play that time when
[43:32] that was the way they had it
[43:36] always start off at a certain thing they
[43:38] started off in the creation
[43:40] and you could you know it was just like
[43:43] floating around everything was without
[43:45] form and void it just moving and all at
[43:48] once out just stepped a man
[43:53] and the man said let there be
[43:56] you know they done the best they could
[43:57] do about bringing the world et cetera
[43:59] the things and and then all at once
[44:02] that man just disappears
[44:05] and they started a baby crying in a
[44:07] cradle
[44:09] well you know when that man reached
[44:11] about
[44:14] 30 years of age
[44:16] the Earth Stood on Earth
[44:18] the one that stood back there
[44:23] but Ryan said Moses saw the back part of
[44:26] God in a theophany
[44:32] that was the same God that walked ashore
[44:34] to Galilee
[44:37] but he said you can't see my face
[44:40] because see you couldn't see the face of
[44:42] God and live
[44:43] that wouldn't work
[44:45] so he could move over into another form
[44:47] so remember what happened in the garden
[44:49] that this great Eternal begins to reveal
[44:52] himself make himself known
[44:55] and he's a light and then from the light
[44:58] steps her body
[45:00] a theophany
[45:03] and begins to speak
[45:05] let there be
[45:07] huh
[45:09] and if he does
[45:13] then coming into being is the things
[45:15] that he spoke around said he believed
[45:17] his own word I love that how can you
[45:20] comprehend what a prophet would say
[45:22] he'd say in the beginning before the
[45:24] Eternal now how in the world are you
[45:26] going to get that kind of language down
[45:28] to understand it
[45:30] in the beginning before the eternal
[45:34] the only thing I can say is that we we
[45:36] use the word Eternal for a circle but
[45:38] back before it was ever a circle he was
[45:41] almighty God all right but look what he
[45:43] says
[45:46] just think of it
[45:48] is there two eternal life
[45:53] we're on number six
[45:55] yeah
[45:57] you couldn't answer that could you
[45:59] there's one eternal life
[46:01] and that's the life of God
[46:03] this other kind of life no matter what
[46:06] it is it's got an end to it anything had
[46:08] a beginning has an end but anything that
[46:10] had no beginning has no end and God said
[46:13] he would give us eternal life without
[46:15] beginning we were just
[46:19] made a part of him
[46:24] this man
[46:25] is just a part of him
[46:28] all right
[46:30] and actually the life that's in US
[46:31] wasn't brought here by human nature
[46:34] nature gives us Spirit but that Spirit
[46:35] died and we got the spirit of God glory
[46:38] to God
[46:39] what was God was God a man said
[46:42] certainly let us make man in our own
[46:44] image what was God
[46:46] but the offney body
[46:49] yeah what was God but the off any body
[46:55] you couldn't see him we'll get to it
[46:57] there's no way to be able to look at him
[46:59] at what we're talking about except by
[47:01] the eye of faith
[47:07] you can't look at him and see him it's
[47:08] by the eye of faith
[47:16] look
[47:17] what was God a theophany body
[47:20] and their man was made like that and put
[47:24] over the garden
[47:30] now when Adam was put in the garden
[47:34] the spiritual atom not the physical man
[47:36] now we're still not there yet okay
[47:43] he would be called a random God at low
[47:45] God Son of God speech uh supernatural
[47:49] being Holy Spirit theophany
[47:56] All For Adam
[47:59] mm-hmm
[48:00] and he ain't brought a thing into
[48:02] existence yet because this is before the
[48:05] foundation of all of those things
[48:08] all right watch him and their man was
[48:11] made like that and put over the garden
[48:13] but there was no man to till the soil in
[48:16] the senses then he created man Out of
[48:18] the Dust of the Earth
[48:19] in the animal life and that man till the
[48:23] soil
[48:24] and the man fell by transgression
[48:26] correctly and God the theophany
[48:30] come down and was made flesh and dwelt
[48:33] among us to redeem the man
[48:36] God the theophany came down
[48:41] to dwell were
[48:43] in Jesus Christ
[48:46] right
[48:48] to redeem the man all right
[48:51] now
[48:54] go ahead and number
[48:57] seven
[48:59] entombment 19.
[49:02] 19 and 57 420
[49:07] the entombment program 77.
[49:11] the Bible said he ascended he went and
[49:14] preached to the souls that were in
[49:16] prison they repented not in the long
[49:18] suffering in the days of Noah
[49:20] now this has proven what God is
[49:23] all right to see what we are
[49:26] his soul his Spirit his theophany of his
[49:29] being
[49:32] run theophany and you'll find it's 44
[49:34] times I think and a lot of those I can
[49:38] give you laying on the desk at home is
[49:39] dealing with the coming into the being
[49:41] of Jesus Christ going to hell to pay the
[49:44] price for you and I
[49:48] but he sold his Spirit his theophany of
[49:50] his being went down
[49:57] and you know what they could look at him
[49:59] and see him he wouldn't have just a
[50:00] floating cloud
[50:04] but it was his soul his theophany
[50:08] the spirit of his being
[50:13] it was almighty God that went to hell
[50:15] for you and I
[50:16] but it was the soul of God
[50:23] come on that's why he's a creator of all
[50:26] time
[50:28] not to flash me in there come on
[50:31] the spirit man the Christ Colossians 1
[50:35] Hebrews 1 John 1 read them
[50:38] James 3 and verse when I'll get that one
[50:40] where it says that Jesus Christ created
[50:42] all things
[50:46] so that had to be the Creator God all
[50:48] right
[50:52] would you like to follow him a few
[50:53] minutes let's see where he went just
[50:55] below the regions of mortal beings lays
[50:58] this realm of the demon power below that
[51:00] just below that lays the soul to the
[51:02] unjust
[51:03] blow it lays the very domain of Satan
[51:06] hell
[51:07] then just above us lays the Holy Spirit
[51:11] and in under the altar lays The Souls of
[51:14] the just men and the next is God himself
[51:17] one going downward one going upward the
[51:20] two Spirits are here on Earth
[51:23] influencing the people of the Earth
[51:25] because I'm sure it's in here I'll get
[51:28] to it in a minute but around said he
[51:30] went to speak to those in hell that were
[51:33] he went in theophany and he said they
[51:36] were in theophany
[51:40] the center has a theophany has a place
[51:42] to go to which is his soul
[51:47] the body don't go to hell
[51:49] Spirit don't go to hell it's the soul of
[51:51] mankind
[51:54] see we don't think about a soul being
[51:56] real we think our souls at each Square
[51:58] compartment with some kind of little
[51:59] spot
[52:07] but around said
[52:09] Moses saw
[52:12] the back part
[52:14] of God
[52:16] called it a theophany
[52:20] a man
[52:25] that was the back that finally took the
[52:27] stripes for you and I not that physical
[52:29] back that physical back was not there
[52:32] come on
[52:35] this is theophany
[52:37] you can't beat a theophany
[52:39] you can beat the person that's in
[52:43] there's no way to kill her theophany
[52:45] even God has to destroy the soul of
[52:48] mankind eventually
[52:50] nothing else can
[52:53] the following
[52:56] let's take a quick trip for
[52:59] six thousand years
[53:01] then we'll jump back to this we'll bring
[53:02] this back later okay go to the next one
[53:04] go to 7A
[53:08] this is Israel in the church
[53:10] and here he goes torn Riven Torn to
[53:12] Pieces
[53:14] he saw what to God listen God blessed
[53:17] him
[53:17] and then Israel returned back in the
[53:20] form of the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[53:23] that comes into every believer to
[53:25] sanctify clean up the Mind clean up the
[53:28] heart and leave a portion of the holy
[53:29] spirit in there he said yeah but it's so
[53:31] we just got through reading it do I need
[53:33] to read it again if so went to hell
[53:35] first then his soul went to God
[53:38] right did not he raise and go up
[53:45] all right come on
[53:47] look what he says the holy ghost in the
[53:49] his soul returned back in the form of
[53:52] the baptism of the holy ghost that comes
[53:53] into every believer to sanctify clean up
[53:55] the Mind clean up the heart and leave a
[53:57] portion of the Holy Ghost in there
[53:59] we only have a portion of the Holy Ghost
[54:02] well because we had all that we'd be God
[54:06] so we have a portion of the Holy Ghost
[54:07] which is eternal life that makes us a
[54:09] child of God
[54:12] is this time manifest in a many membered
[54:16] body
[54:18] right that's his form now
[54:21] watch I love this here and there and
[54:24] when the Holy Ghost is given out
[54:29] you know when he's given out
[54:31] amen so this not running out right
[54:37] but all he's going to give out
[54:40] not running out of it
[54:43] but all he's going to give out
[54:47] will end in the last days
[54:50] in Redemption be over now you go to the
[54:52] Jews you go to all of the other things
[54:53] all right all right
[54:56] and when the Holy Ghost is given out
[54:58] that same Holy Spirit
[55:00] that brought the body of Jesus out of
[55:02] the Grave will Rapture and that Covenant
[55:05] has to dovetail has he torn here and
[55:07] gave the body went back to God and the
[55:09] Spirit came back to the Earth then your
[55:11] spirit will have to be the same kind of
[55:14] spirit
[55:16] or it'll miss that place going together
[55:24] amen yes sir not cause you make yourself
[55:28] not because you make yourself but
[55:30] because what
[55:33] something the love of God is swept into
[55:35] your soul and tore every Earthly out
[55:39] there it is
[55:41] the soul of mankind
[55:44] go ahead
[55:46] still talking about God
[55:48] and the fact that he's a theophany
[55:50] questions and answers on Hebrews part 2
[55:53] 57 1007 paragraph 412.
[55:57] here's his body was in the grave
[56:00] and his soul was in hell
[56:02] now do you need these because I've got
[56:04] them at home I don't think I put it in
[56:06] here
[56:07] but brother Ryan said on Calvary that
[56:09] God tore the soul
[56:13] out of that body
[56:17] it wasn't gone up here reaching down
[56:19] here poor now he exited out of the body
[56:23] come on
[56:25] the anointing that came on him on the
[56:27] River Jordan wrote around and said left
[56:29] him in the Garden of Gethsemane
[56:32] but it didn't leave him as though not
[56:34] being God he was God on the cross he
[56:37] said into thy hand I commend my spirit
[56:39] my soul is troubled
[56:41] in the garden
[56:44] there he was still
[56:47] almighty God
[56:50] that Holy Spirit came back on the day of
[56:52] Pentecost into your soul and my soul
[56:54] that's why we're not just anointed ones
[56:58] that comes into your spirit
[57:00] come on
[57:03] here his body was in the grave and his
[57:05] soul was in Hell preaching alive what
[57:07] about that he was in his theophany again
[57:11] his soul was down there with those
[57:13] people that were in theophany also
[57:17] and was witnessing to them that they
[57:20] repented not in the long suffering
[57:24] remember a while ago we read it where he
[57:26] said one is going downward one is going
[57:29] upward
[57:30] the one that's going downward has a body
[57:32] to go to who does work goes to hell
[57:36] it is your body is it your spirit or
[57:38] it's your soul that goes to hell
[57:41] it's the soul of mankind because what is
[57:44] it this
[57:45] finally destroyed
[57:50] the soul
[57:51] of mankind has finally destroyed
[57:54] because that's his body until he gets to
[57:56] the place
[57:58] he's not in his physical it's down in
[58:00] the ground
[58:03] right
[58:05] and see Jesus's body was laying in the
[58:06] grave
[58:10] but down in hell he was paying the price
[58:12] for you and I
[58:14] your soul was in hell his theophany of
[58:18] his being
[58:22] the Holy Spirit himself God Almighty
[58:25] what else you want to call him what else
[58:27] could we bring
[58:29] go ahead
[58:33] number 8A
[58:35] 57 1006. questions and answered on
[58:38] Hebrews part three
[58:39] that's Genesis 1 where he created man in
[58:42] his own image which was in the theophany
[58:47] and in Genesis 2 he made a man out of
[58:49] dusted Earth which was the human man
[58:51] that we have now
[58:53] so what was the Man created
[58:56] yep
[58:59] in the image of God what was it logos
[59:01] the awfully Son of God
[59:03] right amen Holy Spirit supernatural
[59:06] being what else you want
[59:12] it was called a theophany look at the
[59:13] next one
[59:18] this is paragraph two
[59:20] 78.
[59:23] of Hebrews chapter that was who that was
[59:25] uh when we just read 278 okay
[59:28] and now the logos that went out of God
[59:30] which was the Lord gosh all this began
[59:32] to form into a body shape and this body
[59:35] shape was called in the Scholar's
[59:37] teaching logos the logos that went out
[59:39] of God in other words a better word for
[59:41] it was
[59:42] was what we call a theophany
[59:45] now watching theophany is a human body
[59:48] that's glorified
[59:50] what
[59:51] not exactly with flesh and blood
[59:55] but theophany
[59:57] is the soul it's not the flesh and blood
[1:00:03] come on it's not the Flesh and Blood all
[1:00:06] right the theophanese human body that's
[1:00:07] glorified not exactly with flesh and
[1:00:09] blood like it will be in a glorified
[1:00:11] state but it is of a form of a human
[1:00:14] body
[1:00:16] watch a form of a human body that
[1:00:19] doesn't eat
[1:00:21] neither does it drink but it's a body
[1:00:24] a body that's waiting for us as soon as
[1:00:26] we leave this one
[1:00:28] now in there we enter into that body and
[1:00:31] that's the kind of body that God was for
[1:00:33] he said let us make man in our own image
[1:00:35] in our likeness
[1:00:40] and when man become into that body
[1:00:44] theophany
[1:00:45] spiritual body
[1:00:47] he had control of the fish in the
[1:00:49] Thousand beasts and then he there was
[1:00:52] not a man to tell Genesis 2 he made man
[1:00:54] male to female
[1:00:57] that there's no man until the soul
[1:00:59] all right you see it
[1:01:04] look down at the bottom of this and this
[1:01:05] is one we love now remember he's talking
[1:01:07] about let us make man
[1:01:10] this is pirate page 80 of the Hebrew
[1:01:13] Book if you want to read it on the
[1:01:15] naturals paragraph 279
[1:01:18] were you getting a paragraphs but the
[1:01:21] difference between a man and a man
[1:01:23] between an animal and a man God put a
[1:01:26] soul in a man he didn't put it in the
[1:01:28] animal the cause of soul that was in the
[1:01:30] man
[1:01:31] is that theophany
[1:01:37] all right
[1:01:39] and that was a sinner theophany in the
[1:01:43] natural and he's on his way to hell
[1:01:47] in his soul
[1:01:49] not the body and spirit goes it's his
[1:01:51] soul
[1:01:52] when you're born again what happens
[1:01:55] you start the upward
[1:01:58] eternal life comes into you
[1:02:00] by the new birth
[1:02:03] now your soul is your theophany
[1:02:06] are you with me
[1:02:09] think on these things
[1:02:21] yeah
[1:02:23] let's talk a little bit because I've
[1:02:25] asked the other day I mentioned it and I
[1:02:27] was asked to speak on this a good bit
[1:02:29] but we won't spend as much time but
[1:02:31] we'll try
[1:02:34] now remember when we first started
[1:02:37] that we were talking about to remember
[1:02:40] that the Man was created male and female
[1:02:47] right Adam and Eve
[1:02:50] but in his spiritual creation
[1:02:59] in his spiritual creation
[1:03:01] Eve was in Adam
[1:03:12] where was she at
[1:03:15] she was in Adam
[1:03:17] but not in Adam like we talk about being
[1:03:19] an atom
[1:03:23] if Adam was going to get eternal life
[1:03:25] into natural
[1:03:28] I believe Eve got eternal life in her
[1:03:30] soul
[1:03:32] don't have a quote for that
[1:03:34] I don't think I need one
[1:03:36] but that's all right
[1:03:38] that gives you something to argue with
[1:03:39] out there
[1:03:43] but listen
[1:03:47] look what the prophet of God says
[1:03:49] questions and answers on Hebrews
[1:03:51] paragraph 8 26.
[1:03:55] 19 and 57 1008
[1:04:00] oh 10 or six excuse need my glasses
[1:04:04] look
[1:04:05] for when he was first made
[1:04:08] he was made two people together
[1:04:18] you say but but that that was the
[1:04:22] natural
[1:04:23] okay
[1:04:26] we know that's right
[1:04:30] he was made both male and female the man
[1:04:32] was
[1:04:33] the Bible said he was
[1:04:37] God made man both male and female
[1:04:41] created he him
[1:04:43] notice
[1:04:44] when this man was separated from the
[1:04:47] theophany
[1:04:49] and put in flesh
[1:04:52] he was he wasn't just all together there
[1:04:59] part of his being was still in theophany
[1:05:03] so it didn't look right
[1:05:06] so that's not talking about Adam
[1:05:08] naturally right
[1:05:11] Thomas theophany
[1:05:15] to when Adam was given eternal life
[1:05:18] Eve was not in existence physically
[1:05:20] right
[1:05:22] she had to come out and God had to
[1:05:24] breathe into her nostrils and she become
[1:05:25] a living soul
[1:05:28] but in the beginning
[1:05:33] now we're going to talk a little bit on
[1:05:34] what Wade's language okay
[1:05:39] if Adam and Eve
[1:05:43] had the same theophany
[1:05:46] and that's what we're fixing to show
[1:05:49] that should be enough
[1:05:53] then
[1:05:56] there's only one theophany
[1:05:59] it's eternal
[1:06:02] and that's the soul of God
[1:06:06] and might I inject just a thought
[1:06:11] around said when you get a revelation
[1:06:15] that your wife is your wife
[1:06:19] he said she's your wife for life
[1:06:33] you mean me and Peggy had only one Soul
[1:06:36] one theophany
[1:06:38] we'll get to that later we're created
[1:06:41] both of us as a soul as an individual
[1:06:44] this is not talking about that
[1:06:47] this is talking about the eternal
[1:06:52] and sister Gail
[1:06:54] if brother dick was your husband and God
[1:06:56] saw that then you was in him
[1:07:03] now
[1:07:05] if you think that's not right or maybe
[1:07:07] coming wrong
[1:07:09] I'll remind you that
[1:07:12] we were in Christ
[1:07:14] when he came
[1:07:18] though we may be masculine our feminist
[1:07:20] either way what does it matter
[1:07:24] we're the bride of Christ
[1:07:27] which has got to be a part of him
[1:07:30] the only way to be a part of him is have
[1:07:31] his life
[1:07:37] now brother Dale they got that started
[1:07:39] years ago and started Soul swapping
[1:07:41] well you go ahead and swap All Souls you
[1:07:43] want to I Don't Give A hoot that ain't
[1:07:45] none of my business
[1:07:47] I'm a preacher of the Gospel trying to
[1:07:49] get you and I out of here
[1:07:51] don't believe in it
[1:07:56] but Paul had another Heist I don't know
[1:08:03] what are you trying to say
[1:08:06] I'm trying to say the Plan of Redemption
[1:08:08] makes a husband and a wife as the Bible
[1:08:12] would call it
[1:08:14] and they were one
[1:08:20] it's okay so we just read that when man
[1:08:23] was separated and put in theophany
[1:08:26] put in the flesh
[1:08:30] he wasn't us all together there part of
[1:08:33] his being was still a theophany
[1:08:37] where's Eve
[1:08:40] okay
[1:08:41] roll up the next one questions and
[1:08:44] answers on Hebrews 3 this is paragraph 8
[1:08:46] 29.
[1:08:48] which is a continuation
[1:08:51] huh
[1:08:52] and Adam was lonesome
[1:08:54] and God to show that they could not be
[1:08:56] separated
[1:08:59] now I'm going to get back into this same
[1:09:01] thing just a second
[1:09:04] look he never went and got dirt and made
[1:09:06] Eve
[1:09:09] but he made man from the original dirt
[1:09:11] Adam
[1:09:15] he took a riff from his side and made
[1:09:16] him a helpmate and there was Eve
[1:09:19] she was made for the man
[1:09:22] and part of the man
[1:09:27] she was part of him in the beginning
[1:09:30] into Creation in theophany
[1:09:36] she was part of him down here in this
[1:09:38] creation
[1:09:40] she could not be divided in another
[1:09:42] creation
[1:09:43] she had to be
[1:09:46] made in the same creation rolled it up
[1:09:48] just a little that's exactly why Christ
[1:09:51] and God had to be the same person it
[1:09:54] could not be anything different if he'd
[1:09:56] have been a good man or a prophet he
[1:09:58] couldn't have been a redeemer he had to
[1:10:00] be the Creator himself but he's still at
[1:10:02] theophany now see and that's the way he
[1:10:04] was then
[1:10:10] you realize we're talking about eternal
[1:10:11] life
[1:10:14] we're not talking about just some form
[1:10:16] of what's going on
[1:10:20] look at the next one the questions and
[1:10:21] answers on Hebrew this is 6 39 57.
[1:10:26] God in the beginning when he knowed that
[1:10:29] man and woman was made one
[1:10:32] not two
[1:10:33] they were made one
[1:10:35] they were separated
[1:10:38] one put in flesh
[1:10:41] and one in theophany
[1:10:43] he knew that so in order to prove that
[1:10:46] to you when God made the woman
[1:10:51] he never took some dirt and made her
[1:10:53] like he did the man he took a rib out of
[1:10:56] the shot of Adam
[1:10:57] and she become a product of a man
[1:10:59] byproduct of a man because she's part of
[1:11:02] him you get it now see there you are
[1:11:09] he never went that's what I've tried to
[1:11:11] do I know the marriage and divorce and I
[1:11:13] know what the prophet has said
[1:11:18] but I know also what he said
[1:11:21] that there's nothing greater you could
[1:11:22] be given
[1:11:24] than a wife
[1:11:26] if she was a true wife
[1:11:29] nothing outside of Salvation he said
[1:11:36] could be greater than a real wife
[1:11:38] amen why because she's part of it if you
[1:11:41] and I become part of one another by
[1:11:44] marriage
[1:11:46] you know physically
[1:11:51] why couldn't we think about
[1:11:57] you know I I don't
[1:12:00] I just kind of Coach sometimes let this
[1:12:03] old mind wander and
[1:12:05] had there not been a fall I believe my
[1:12:07] wife and I would have come
[1:12:10] if you don't believe that about your
[1:12:12] wife you must have the wrong one
[1:12:15] but I don't suggest you go hunting for
[1:12:17] another one I said yes you start
[1:12:19] repenting of that demon you got on you
[1:12:22] and find out what you got
[1:12:29] and if she's part of you
[1:12:36] okay
[1:12:44] go ahead to the next one
[1:12:48] with 12 seeds not out with a shook 1965
[1:12:51] 429
[1:12:54] paragraph 51 especially but let's go
[1:12:56] let's read it all
[1:12:58] but the church is doing today
[1:13:01] for Jesus is the word and he is the
[1:13:03] bridegroom and the bride is part of the
[1:13:05] groom
[1:13:06] right therefore the word that is to be
[1:13:09] fulfilled and fulfilled this day is the
[1:13:11] same part of the word that was fulfilled
[1:13:13] in his day
[1:13:16] I'd suggest you read that over and over
[1:13:18] and over
[1:13:20] it's the same word same experience same
[1:13:23] life
[1:13:27] for God when God separated Adam
[1:13:30] he was both we find out Adam was Spirit
[1:13:33] to begin with he made man in his own
[1:13:35] image created he male and female
[1:13:38] and gen Genesis 2 and on he created a
[1:13:42] man in Out of the Dust of the earth Man
[1:13:44] was created in God's image God is a
[1:13:47] spirit so he's a spirit man
[1:13:49] and when he become flesh man animal
[1:13:51] Flesh on the earth he is showing
[1:13:54] portraying here
[1:13:55] the bride
[1:13:59] he was showing the bride she was not
[1:14:03] another product
[1:14:05] byproduct we look at that and we want to
[1:14:07] buy product of gas right we'll buy
[1:14:09] products
[1:14:10] go home and look it up
[1:14:13] you don't even look in your dictionary
[1:14:17] I don't need a dictionary I got a REV
[1:14:19] life
[1:14:25] byproduct is something of equal value
[1:14:30] or even greater
[1:14:36] right
[1:14:40] Brother Dean wrote up here in that Buick
[1:14:44] I guess of you again
[1:14:46] Lincoln okay
[1:14:49] better get his car right
[1:14:51] you know what that is that's a byproduct
[1:14:53] of an a model
[1:14:58] right right
[1:15:00] which means of greater value I sure do
[1:15:03] like it better you can keep the a model
[1:15:06] I'll hold that up set it in the building
[1:15:08] to look out but when I ride I want to
[1:15:10] arrive in style
[1:15:13] right
[1:15:15] but see we take byproduct oh that women
[1:15:17] ain't nothing just garbage cans
[1:15:20] a true wife is not a garbage can
[1:15:24] a true wife is part of you
[1:15:38] let's go on what's the next one or did
[1:15:40] we get through with that one
[1:15:42] okay so we're talking about the bride of
[1:15:44] Christ
[1:15:46] we're part of his Spirit part of his
[1:15:48] body flesh of his flesh bone of his bone
[1:15:50] word of his word life of his life and
[1:15:52] that's the way the bride is to Christ
[1:15:56] the bride and Christ are one right
[1:15:59] what's the next one
[1:16:02] e37 which is the messiah
[1:16:04] which is 61 117.
[1:16:07] talk about Messiah
[1:16:09] so where's the eagle has got so has the
[1:16:12] eagle has got it we know that
[1:16:15] and now we say in the man the man before
[1:16:18] I believe leave that subject the man
[1:16:21] with what he is he's got a hand
[1:16:27] you're going to read off the wrong way
[1:16:29] but you better read what he says
[1:16:34] man what is he
[1:16:36] he's got a hand like God
[1:16:38] no no no he's got a hand like a monkey
[1:16:42] well
[1:16:44] what is that quote
[1:16:48] uh-huh
[1:16:52] you've got eyes like God
[1:16:55] you've got ears like God
[1:16:57] a body like God he was fashioned after
[1:17:00] God
[1:17:01] he was given an earth and a Dominion he
[1:17:05] was made God over the Earth to rule the
[1:17:07] Earth a Lesser God
[1:17:13] rules the universe everything but man
[1:17:16] was given the Earth to rule the Earth
[1:17:19] he he was a messiah
[1:17:24] that's what he is tonight if he gets
[1:17:27] back to God
[1:17:28] he is a messiah a little Messiah
[1:17:31] if he had if Messiah means anointed one
[1:17:35] and you're anointed then what are you
[1:17:37] that's exactly right I Messiah we call
[1:17:40] it that just for the words sake till we
[1:17:44] get a little father down in the
[1:17:46] scripture on it
[1:17:48] a messiah
[1:17:50] a Lesser God
[1:17:54] now if he wasn't in the spiritual
[1:17:57] creation
[1:18:02] if he wasn't into spiritual creation
[1:18:06] he's not even considered in this point
[1:18:11] if we don't have eternal life tonight
[1:18:14] we're nothing but cannon fodder
[1:18:19] 245 pounds
[1:18:21] of cannon fodder
[1:18:24] what did Doctor asked me the other day
[1:18:26] he said what are you up to I said 2 45.
[1:18:30] he just died laughing
[1:18:35] but listen Church
[1:18:38] God likes to work through man
[1:18:42] he made him a god
[1:18:47] it's going down to 14.
[1:18:49] it was round 13 let's go to 14. and I
[1:18:52] want to leave this one
[1:18:56] 1966-26 the unfailing realities of the
[1:18:58] Living God
[1:19:01] God always likes to work through man
[1:19:03] it's God's program to work through men
[1:19:05] do you believe that congregation says
[1:19:07] amen
[1:19:08] God works through men he made man his
[1:19:11] helper on Earth he made him a Lesser God
[1:19:14] than himself
[1:19:16] any problem
[1:19:19] now look where he goes now we've been
[1:19:21] through that in the teaching lately of
[1:19:22] Genesis 1 26.
[1:19:24] when he was Elohim the all-sufficient
[1:19:28] the self-existing one and then in him
[1:19:31] was attributes of Father Son and Holy
[1:19:33] Spirit not three Gods three officers in
[1:19:36] him that he was to live in those
[1:19:38] dispensations he was a savior he was a
[1:19:41] king he was a God all these things
[1:19:43] displayed
[1:19:45] theirselves it's the attributes of God
[1:19:48] see but in that in him at the beginning
[1:19:50] Bruno
[1:19:53] that was in him at the beginning so I
[1:19:55] just cut it off all right roll the next
[1:19:57] one up let's get it and then we'll quit
[1:20:01] I think it's 15.
[1:20:05] yeah
[1:20:08] and when God made man in his own image
[1:20:10] he put him on the earth as a Lesser God
[1:20:12] Jesus declared it when he said it is not
[1:20:15] written in your laws it's your gods and
[1:20:17] if we call those Gods who the word of
[1:20:19] God come to which were the prop was the
[1:20:22] prophets how can you condemn me when I
[1:20:25] say I'm the son of God
[1:20:26] he said see they just couldn't
[1:20:28] understand see but a man was put here
[1:20:31] with a dominion over the Earth he had
[1:20:34] everything under his control
[1:20:39] okay
[1:20:42] all finished
[1:20:49] I'll bring you the quote if you'd like
[1:20:50] it I've given it to you
[1:20:52] but around said
[1:20:54] when he said let us make man
[1:20:58] said he didn't say
[1:21:01] let us make man
[1:21:03] he said to make a man a singer in other
[1:21:06] words
[1:21:07] Genesis 1 26 and 27 is one man
[1:21:13] that's the man Christ Jesus
[1:21:16] and only through that can you and I have
[1:21:19] a new birth
[1:21:20] it's true receiving the life of Jesus
[1:21:24] Christ the soul
[1:21:27] he gave his soul a ransom
[1:21:31] all right
[1:21:34] his theophany of his being
[1:21:37] went to hell in your place and mine his
[1:21:39] soul
[1:21:40] but then he sent his soul back on the
[1:21:42] day of Pentecost in the form of the
[1:21:44] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:21:48] eternal life
[1:21:50] eternal life is a person
[1:21:52] not a thought or a concept or a Doctrine
[1:21:56] so what did he make in Genesis 1 26 and
[1:21:59] 27 he made a spiritual man
[1:22:05] he made Christ
[1:22:08] the son of the Living God
[1:22:11] that's why Peter that's what he would
[1:22:12] call him who the man say hi to son of
[1:22:14] man he said to our Christ
[1:22:17] and what did he say
[1:22:20] he said Peter you didn't get what I'm
[1:22:21] talking about I asked you about the son
[1:22:22] of man but you didn't get it he said you
[1:22:24] answered the question I am the Christ
[1:22:26] but sit up on that rock I'll build my
[1:22:29] church
[1:22:30] and the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail
[1:22:31] against it look what they've done with
[1:22:33] it though they've Twisted pushed it
[1:22:35] hammered it doctored it done everything
[1:22:37] in the book to turn it away
[1:22:39] but yet God has brought it on all the
[1:22:42] way through
[1:22:42] the prophet of God said reading one day
[1:22:45] he said there's always been just a fine
[1:22:46] little line that stayed with the truth
[1:22:53] a fine little lion that stayed with the
[1:22:55] truth
[1:22:56] you know why because they're just a fine
[1:22:58] little line
[1:22:59] of Genesis 1 26 and 27.
[1:23:06] you said what brother Dale looks like
[1:23:08] that
[1:23:09] then is God predestinating us and
[1:23:12] choosing you and I now we're going to
[1:23:14] get to this flesh
[1:23:16] this being that we are
[1:23:19] and see why we need a new birth
[1:23:24] see this being that we are
[1:23:27] Body Spirit and soul comes into the
[1:23:30] world lost
[1:23:33] yeah but but I I
[1:23:35] understand
[1:23:37] and the prophet said the little woman at
[1:23:38] the well and the little seed of
[1:23:40] representation from predestination
[1:23:43] another time he said by predestination
[1:23:48] predestination only deals with your
[1:23:50] Earthly Journey
[1:23:53] I haven't spoke any of predestination so
[1:23:56] far after I told you we was going back
[1:23:58] in the mind of God some five six sermons
[1:24:01] as being on eternal life
[1:24:05] not talking about him predestinating he
[1:24:08] didn't predestinate a bride he didn't
[1:24:10] create a bride
[1:24:14] the bride is him made manifest
[1:24:17] in another form
[1:24:20] called the children of God The Offspring
[1:24:23] of God
[1:24:26] Eve was in adamant theophany
[1:24:29] and when Adam was put into flesh we just
[1:24:32] read it
[1:24:33] was still a part of Adam wouldn't write
[1:24:35] that's why he was lonely
[1:24:38] right
[1:24:41] Adam was lonely
[1:24:45] because part of him was still in
[1:24:47] theophany
[1:24:51] right
[1:24:54] I thought we believed too that right
[1:24:56] around said God was lonely
[1:25:01] now get out of your masculine feminish
[1:25:05] and I say that as hard as I can say it
[1:25:07] get out of your masculine feminist
[1:25:09] thinking
[1:25:12] there's doctrines in this message it was
[1:25:14] what down here in Florida that there was
[1:25:16] a female Holy Ghost
[1:25:18] God had a male Holy Ghost and we was a
[1:25:21] female Holy Ghost
[1:25:22] see they tried to preach the truth
[1:25:24] but without having a teacher to put the
[1:25:26] word together I wanted to do with it
[1:25:28] I don't back up
[1:25:31] what do they do with it split the
[1:25:33] message I talked to the man that
[1:25:36] believed that Doctrine and I told him I
[1:25:38] said
[1:25:39] them two brothers
[1:25:41] one of them was teaching two Lords the
[1:25:43] other one was teaching a female Holy
[1:25:45] Ghost a male I said you split this
[1:25:47] message wide open
[1:25:50] and both of you saying the same thing
[1:25:53] two Lords two Holy Ghost same thing two
[1:25:57] Souls did all the same thing
[1:26:02] did you see why I fight so hard and
[1:26:04] ain't never been very well liked as far
[1:26:07] as my ways of speaking and my doings
[1:26:10] but come and let's talk about the word
[1:26:16] coming let's sit down and talk about it
[1:26:18] but
[1:26:21] because listen
[1:26:23] if Even Adam was one soul
[1:26:27] they wasn't but one soul back there
[1:26:30] right and that's the soul of God
[1:26:32] and if we have the new birth in our soul
[1:26:35] then that soul is made eternal
[1:26:39] and that Soul was the soul of God to
[1:26:41] come from for the foundation of the
[1:26:43] world
[1:26:44] God was lonely
[1:26:48] Adam was in flesh and he was in
[1:26:51] theophany and Adam was lonely
[1:26:54] he wasn't lonely when he was in
[1:26:56] theophany controlling the animals
[1:26:58] because he was in theophany with him
[1:27:01] come on
[1:27:04] but when he was put in flesh he was
[1:27:06] lonely
[1:27:09] God was lonely
[1:27:16] he brought his children into being
[1:27:22] so he could fellowship with his children
[1:27:26] are we the female well that's kind of
[1:27:28] problem don't it because there's a lot
[1:27:30] of us male sitting here tonight
[1:27:33] but see if you want to get into some
[1:27:35] silliness
[1:27:37] sat down with the truth and think about
[1:27:39] it
[1:27:41] all I'm talking about God revealing
[1:27:44] himself to mankind
[1:27:49] that's all I'm trying to bring out
[1:27:52] and how he comes down is going to call
[1:27:54] it condescend or whatever or change it
[1:27:57] in form reveals himself
[1:28:02] and to know that before the world ever
[1:28:04] begun
[1:28:06] he knew how many children he was going
[1:28:08] to have
[1:28:12] and he was lonely
[1:28:17] because he couldn't put him in the flesh
[1:28:22] but one day he put us in flesh
[1:28:30] he's not Lonely no More
[1:28:35] I get up in the night
[1:28:39] sometime three or four times every night
[1:28:43] go to the bathroom
[1:28:44] 73 years old
[1:28:48] stupid enough to drink a lot of drinks
[1:28:51] before I go to bed
[1:28:54] but you know what
[1:28:56] sometimes I love to just get up and walk
[1:28:58] through the house
[1:29:02] and I just talked to him
[1:29:06] and I said Lord thank you for waking me
[1:29:08] up
[1:29:12] Lord I love you
[1:29:16] and I'm not a prior Warrior that's got
[1:29:17] all these great languages that can be
[1:29:19] said I just speak from my heart
[1:29:22] and say Lord I love you
[1:29:24] and Lord you know that old church up
[1:29:26] there we got and trying to help them
[1:29:30] Lord you know the needs of everybody
[1:29:31] desire
[1:29:35] he just used to supply their needs
[1:29:39] you guide us all
[1:29:42] Norman walk back and you don't know I'm
[1:29:44] gonna go back to bed and go back to
[1:29:45] sleep
[1:29:49] but I want you to know I love you
[1:29:54] somebody said one time said the reason
[1:29:56] you wake up at three in the morning said
[1:29:57] God wants somebody to talk to said he's
[1:30:00] lonely
[1:30:02] well talk to him
[1:30:07] just just walk through the house and
[1:30:09] just talk to him just like he'd be
[1:30:11] talking to me if I was there
[1:30:14] because he's a whole lot more real
[1:30:18] God is real
[1:30:20] he's not a thought in your mind
[1:30:23] he's real
[1:30:26] he's the person of eternal life come on
[1:30:28] brothers
[1:30:32] take on these things
[1:30:34] we got one more message it could be a
[1:30:36] hive and I have connected but we're
[1:30:38] going to try to start downward with the
[1:30:40] man then
[1:30:43] and then we'll really get on the
[1:30:44] predestination
[1:30:49] and how is it that God predestinates
[1:30:54] by his foreknowledge
[1:30:59] not that he chooses
[1:31:02] but that we choose to stand yes but you
[1:31:05] don't understand we don't choose
[1:31:14] okay go on forget it
[1:31:17] you know
[1:31:20] I know what he's talking about the Bible
[1:31:22] said it's the goodness of God that lead
[1:31:24] us to repentance I happen to do know a
[1:31:26] little bit about the scriptures you know
[1:31:29] you know what caused you and I sister
[1:31:31] Gail to come to God was his goodness
[1:31:36] but then we start
[1:31:40] he looked down and seen that we'd want
[1:31:42] it but he looked down and seen the
[1:31:43] others that he'd make contact with maybe
[1:31:45] more than you
[1:31:46] and he seemed they wouldn't want it
[1:31:49] so he could predestinate
[1:31:54] and he's not a respecter of person
[1:31:58] if you love God with all your heart you
[1:32:00] ought to be the happiest person in the
[1:32:01] world
[1:32:03] to think about God loving you and I what
[1:32:07] do we got
[1:32:12] all in him
[1:32:15] almighty God is Jesus the prince of
[1:32:19] peace
[1:32:25] you
[1:32:37] ought to hear them saying that song they
[1:32:38] wrote it
[1:32:43] talk to God
[1:32:45] it is
[1:32:56] see that's why they went to the Jesus
[1:32:58] only
[1:33:01] they can see all those scriptures
[1:33:09] but as I'm speaking to him I could just
[1:33:11] all I had to do was remind them
[1:33:14] do you know that scripture here is this
[1:33:17] scripture there only just shouting and I
[1:33:20] said now let's turn over here and read
[1:33:21] about this man in Romans 7.
[1:33:27] it's Melchizedek
[1:33:30] and let's talk about him that had no
[1:33:33] beginning of days and no end of No Life
[1:33:36] that's it Jesus had a beginning with
[1:33:39] flesh man
[1:33:41] Jesus had to be beginning and he had to
[1:33:44] be made Eternal or they quietened up
[1:33:50] it really quietened up because they they
[1:33:52] knew I'd hit something but they couldn't
[1:33:54] argue scripture
[1:33:58] foreign
[1:34:06] but Jesus Christ the almighty God had no
[1:34:09] beginning and that's who Melchizedek was
[1:34:12] the man
[1:34:17] the
[1:34:20] Bible says he was
[1:34:28] that at least what I preached on this
[1:34:30] when Jesus comes again
[1:35:00] and remember that is John 1 1. in the
[1:35:05] beginning was the word the word was with
[1:35:08] God and the Word was God
[1:35:10] then that word was made flesh and
[1:35:12] dwelled Among Us
[1:35:18] the Great understanding to think about
[1:35:21] it I'm trying to get you to see God is
[1:35:23] real
[1:35:28] if he chose to he could try here tonight
[1:35:31] change and stand right here in morphe
[1:35:35] reveal himself right here because he's
[1:35:38] God
[1:35:39] and what would you say well well I feel
[1:35:42] it alive that's what everybody does
[1:35:45] they want to grab a camera when you
[1:35:47] mentioned lights or something then we'll
[1:35:48] take a picture of the camera
[1:35:51] run
[1:35:55] you mentioned billified they want a
[1:35:57] camera that's right
[1:36:01] you mean that angel of the Lord that
[1:36:02] appeared to brother Bradham that was
[1:36:04] about 200 pound about six foot around
[1:36:07] six foot 200 pounds and kind of long
[1:36:10] hair and wearing a rope you mean he's
[1:36:14] more real
[1:36:15] than God
[1:36:22] oh when that man would stand there
[1:36:26] he said that God created a world is not
[1:36:30] no more than three or four feet right
[1:36:32] over here
[1:36:36] foreign
[1:36:41] he was standing there
[1:36:45] is
[1:36:50] a lot of people never see it to that
[1:36:52] form I know it
[1:36:55] saying it real
[1:36:58] like 40 years of testifying about it
[1:37:02] don't make me nothing
[1:37:05] but it makes him something he's kept his
[1:37:07] word
[1:37:10] he told me he said well why don't you do
[1:37:12] this without the other you're talking
[1:37:13] about he told me this one day he said
[1:37:16] you preach the word
[1:37:18] he said I'll back it up
[1:37:22] I said yes sir but I've been trying my
[1:37:26] best to do
[1:37:29] how many gods in Israel have
[1:37:32] how many gods is a bride of Christ's
[1:37:35] house
[1:37:39] yet they had many many different times
[1:37:42] of seeing him
[1:37:50] look what mankind did when that man
[1:37:52] walked on Earth that had been down
[1:37:54] through that Old Testament
[1:37:56] revealing himself
[1:38:00] killed him
[1:38:05] let's don't turn down the word
[1:38:12] turn down the word in the end time
[1:38:16] we don't understand it that's no problem
[1:38:18] I don't understand it
[1:38:21] and I believe what I do understand
[1:38:25] is alive
[1:38:29] I believe it don't you I'm set up right
[1:38:33] oh they tell me
[1:38:37] sing it unto him before we go tell me
[1:38:54] 171
[1:38:58] .
