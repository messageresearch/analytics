we can be confident of that God is still the same yesterday today and forever things change and we change and you know we get a little out of sorts but he's still the same amen let's turn to Matthew chapter 6 and the Sunday school class is going to hear a little repeat this morning amen good so uh we'll we'll start on Matthew chapter 6 and then we'll go over to Matthew 13 but before we read let's go to the author Lord Jesus we thank you God for your grace to us to be able to come into your house to gather around your word Lord and I believe that everyone here tonight has one thing in common that we want to be more like you Lord Jesus Lord as we look into the mirror of your word to see where we stand and where we are and the hour that we live in Lord I pray God that you'll help us to achieve that goal to be more like you to grow more and Grace and stature to be to to until we come into the fullness of of perfect man Lord Jesus God that's my prayer this Mo this tonight Lord Jesus and I pray God that you'll meet every need that you'll meet every desire Lord tonight Lord meet every secret every secret desire and need in our hearts Lord Jesus as we come Lord and Lord I barely know what to say Lord Jesus but you know all things you have the end in the be in the beginning everything in your hands Lord Jesus you got Lord we just put tonight in your hands Lord Jesus that you'll come and you'll have the preeminence in our lives and in their service Lord as we read this scripture Lord that you'll just come and open it to us Lord because how could we have any understanding how could we have a relationship with you how could we know anything about what your word says unless you come and reveal it unless you come and Quicken it with your spirit Lord we come believing and trusting in you that you'll open it to us and cause us to catch the message we pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ thank him for his presence here tonight Matthew chapter 6 verse one take heed that you do not your arms before men to be seen of them otherwise you have no reward of your father which is in heaven that's right therefore when thou doest thine arms do not sound a trumpet before thee as the Hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets that they may have Glory of men verily I say unto you they have their reward but when thou doest arms let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth that thine arms may be in secret and thy father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly amen and when thou prayest Thou shalt not be as the Hypocrites are for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets that they may be seen seen of men verily I say unto you they have their reward but thou when thou prayest enter into thy closet and when thou has shut thy door pray to thy father which is in secret and thy father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly amen now let's turn over to Matthew chapter 13 33 another Parable spake ye unto them the Kingdom of Heaven is like un 11 which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal till the whole was living you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word every time that you read the word you get a blessing even if you don't understand it all it's still a blessing right and this morning this tonight I uh let me get the time of day straight tonight I I want to take a a maybe a strange topic but I I got to thinking on the the lonely Christian and maybe that almost sounds like a a topic for a western you hear that western music playing but the the lonely Christian and you know I I when I stand outside the door you know shaking hands and and whatnot I I there's that picture that right across from where I stand where I usually stand and and and I I got to where I love looking at that picture of the pillar fire over the children of Israel and all the all the children of Israel are encamped around about the children of fire and they you I I got to thinking about what they you know you just stand looking at that picture and think about what what they must have thought as they sat there and they could see the pillar of fire they could see the signs and wonders made manifest in their midst they could see God among them and then the years began to roll by right and you know each each they were all gathered around the pillar of fire all of them together but if you look closely there's little individual tents and each one of those tents has a little light inside of it that's right am and I want to kind of narrow down because you know we if I I'm looking out at the crowd tonight and we're all gathered around maybe kind of like how they were gathered around that Pillar of Fire we're gathered around the word of God the shed blood gathered around the carcass and but each each one of us is a little individual liqu of fire that that is May maybe the the lonely Christian you're you're going through life and each one of us has to work out our own salvation with fear and trembling each one of us has a lonely Journey but maybe I could prove to you today that we're not lonely because he said he'd never leave us or forsake us he'd always be with us he promised us a comforter that would come and take us through this journey of life now now let's go back to that little picture because because as as the years began to grow by I believe and and you we can see by scripture that that they began to lose sight of what they were there for and you know now in this day it kind of parallels their Journey how just about time they were be they were ready to cross over and claim their inheritance what God had given them they god-given right then God began God sent something allow something to come that would shake things up and we know in Isaiah that it's promised that that the heavens and earth will be shaken everything will be shaken and everything that can be shaken will be shaken except that which is anchored in something that cannot be moved that is immovable and I I remember uh years ago standing in the supermarket line they had a a uh one of those little pamphlets about different things different strange happenings around the world it was just a a little thing maybe for little kitties to read and what struck my attention that it still holds yeah I still remember it to this day was a little article that about this uh a post in England that they they came across and they they dug down and they begin to dig and dig and it went further and further into the ground and and after a lot of uh asking around they found on the opposite side of the earth there was another post and as far as they dug that post went down into the ground as far as they dug they couldn't get to the bottom of it now I I've tried to find uh that story uh later on so I don't know if that particular story is true but I I kind of compare that to how faith is when you become when you receive the new birth because faith is anchored down so far that it is not shakable you cannot what what are you going to come up against with some kind of theology some kind of new new doctrine new thing that will disprove what God has given to you in a personal relationship that's right what he's given to you like those little camped out Believers around the pillar of fire should have had an a personal experience just like Joshua and Caleb I believe Joshua and Caleb knew something they knew something something personal when they all the other ones came back from kades barnea and said we can't do it and Joshua and Caleb rent their clothes and everybody else tried to kill them and then the fire came out and and uh and and began to devour and things because they knew that God was still the same yesterday today and forever they knew who he was they had something person a personal experience they had seen God working in moses' life they had seen him there manifesting himself and they knew that there was no way that they could come could come out of bondage without God delivering them that there was no way he could have done it without him making a way for them Lord and God I think back to how loneliness first began to play a role in the Christian story loneliness is what started the whole thing because God way back Bey beyond the be beginning of the beginnings was alone and he wanted and I got to thinking about this because he we were inside of him but we weren't he wasn't like some grotesque figur you know like half man half woman or something like that but we were we were attributes that were waiting to be expressed within from him and he was longing and lonely for that attribute those attributes to be made manifest he was something within was craving to to to fellowship with what was within him am and when that was made manifest and Adam and Eve took leevan took some other idea something that's from something that was contrary to God then God looked at what at his attributes expressed walking away from his word from himself and he saw y'all excuse me yeah he saw he he saw what he had longed to see made manifest leaving and deserting going going the opposite direction and there was there's real loneliness and look look at this picture now God looked upon the scene and he didn't just sit back and sit back in like the proverbial recliner and say well I'm going to leave well enough alone but he was fervent to do whatever it took whatever the cost was to get back into fellowship with us whatever it takes whatever the cost is he was willing to pay it all to lay down everything so that he could come back and reclaim to to pay the P Price so that he didn't have to be lonely anymore loneliness and a the believer the whole relationship with God comes down to an individual Affair an individual relationship with God back in the Garden of Eden when Adam every every even and Adam would come and and he would wait for God to come down and and pay him a visit and I don't believe that God would have to maybe God just to paint a little picture maybe he was looking at the calendar waiting counting down the time counting down the time for when he could come and fellowship with Adam and maybe ad Adam was doing the same thing counting down the hours until he could come and fellowship with God and and and hear the word and now Adam in that situation longing to have fellowship with God despairing to be alone wanting to have wanting to be one with God uniting around the word and now today we can't even come to church we can't even sit we can't we we count the hours that we're away from church we uh we're we should be long and we should be fervent not in Sunday School uh we were looking at how Jesus uh talked about when John came on the earth that the believer the people began to be so fervent that it was almost like violence that they became so violently in fervor of of the word and of trying to hear the word that they would sit for hours longing to listen longing to get just one little Glimpse that maybe they didn't understand when he began to speak about the Deep things maybe they the many of the things that he talked about were so far over their head or just so mysterious because he said he he spoke in Parables and spoke in a way that many couldn't understand but yet they were they knew that this man spoke from from a a way that wasn't from theology it wasn't from some he didn't learn it from some Seminary but he knew it because something within him within him was was whirling that will in the middle of the wheel that was spoken throughout all scripture was that would the the great teacher that will would one day come and live inside of the Flesh of Believers and teach us was there to teach them and they hungered and longed for it and they sat on the hill longing until they didn't care if they did if they were hungry they didn't care if they were tired but they came regardless they came because there was something in them drawing and they were violently enthus to whatever it takes whatever it takes if I have to leave my family leave my job leave whatever to go and sit on this Hillside and listen to this one that I've been longing to hear my whole life and they I I was looking down through scripture and this is a common trait for everyone that come comes to God comes individually and comes with a fervency that God will satisfy now in the Old Testament Jacob it is we the story of Jacob is told how he when when he was in the the depths of Despair and so lonely he was coming to meet his brother who he was afraid was going to kill him because of what he had done to him how he had stolen the birthright and and did according to the Natural ey did horrible things to his brother and you know Esau had even decare that he would do Jacob harm he had every right to think that Jake that Esau was going to do him harm and and so he sent in his wisdom he sent uh his family over and and little groups to to kind of soften Esau's heart and then he stayed behind and camped the night over because he wanted to be alone with God and I uh here here we go I knew I had the scripture somewhere written in Genesis 32:24 and Jacob was left alone and there Wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day and Jacob was left alone that might be some of the most powerful words there just little four little words in the Bible because that is how we meet God alone alone brother Brenham came down to that little shed and he had an experience where the he saw that light that cross come into his his heart because he was alone and Jacob was alone he was longing for something that where could he turned who could he turn to he was in he was lonely and the only man that could satisfy that longing was the man that he met that night when he was alone and wrestled with him and wrestled with him that's that's an instance in the Bible of real violence a man that turned so was so desperate for something from God that he became violent and he became and he wrestled with God and he said I'll not Turn You Loose until I get my blessing that's how you get a blessing from God is when you're so longing so desperate for something and I I wonder how many times we don't get the blessings that we seek and the blessings that we need because we're not desperate enough to do anything to lay down everything we're not desperate enough to stop looking at the clock long enough to get down on our knees and pray and seek God for a blessing for our children and for our church and for our families and for our homes and for ourselves that God I know that in this Bible these blessings that you spoke about are here waiting for me to receive now God give them and make them manifest in my life make them manifest make them live in me make the stature of a perfect man that brother Dale brother Wade and and all these brothers have spoke about Let It Be Alive in me let it be real and how I believe that if we'll do that if we'll come with aacy with a a longing in our heart just like Jacob did just like these men of old that were were alone with God like Abraham and Isaac the the Father the foundation of the church was built upon these brothers faith if we'll come like that then God is HonorBound to to to meet us based upon his word he's HonorBound to give us what's been promised it's not when we look at God's word you know plenty of theologians have studied the script and have no life right plenty of theologians have looked at the scripture it's not just about how much you know but it's about how much you know him and you know we think about how if I if I can just study enough but look at all the uh I now don't get me wrong studying is a has a place right of course it does but now look at all the the men and and and and people singing Austine and all the other ones that that had a deep understanding according to the theology according to school according to what they what they did they could they could understand according to Baptist Theology and take any denomination any sect and could understand it and explain it in a way that uh would just confound the wise but yet had no understanding look look when on the day of Pentecost these little fishermen little the the the just the offs scour of the Earth according to the world suddenly had a deeper understanding than men and women uh that had that had labored under theology under Galeo and so forth because they had something they had a a relationship with God a personal experience now in the Old Testament the priest when he would go into the holy of holies he would check up with that and make sure that everything was right as he approached in to the holy of holies and I I compare this now with this checking up time as the the the children of Israel were they were encamped around the pillar of fire and they failed I believe to keep checking up every hour to keep checking up and comparing what they believed with the message that Moses preached with the message with the word that was being carried in the Ark of the Covenant they failed to check up and before long balum came in with something a little bit off that seemed correct that seemed right and and they became sidetracked and they they the shaking came and they fell they they were shaken because of what happened now the Old Testament priest would get it go into the holy of holies and he would check up everything on him everything to make sure that everything was correct everything was in line that everything was uh was just perfectly uh not one pomegranate off not one little bell not one little little piece of an anointing oil or one uh little piece of His Garment because if one little thing was off then he had he had no right to begin with to go into that holy of holies but it was God that had made a special provision for him to go beyond that Veil that was sealed off until the day that the atonement had been made then then all the Believers could go Beyond the Veil but God had made a way so that that priest could go Beyond the Veil as long as he met every one of God's requirements right every one of God's requirements had to be met and just in case he missed one he had to leave that string hanging out that rope so that they could pull his dead body back from Beyond the Veil if he failed to meet every single requirement now what about us in this day when we have a uh a standard laid before us we have a goal and the goal is a goal that has never been met before in the history of Christian om of of judum whatever you want to call it and the goal is to take a body change the goal is to take for our flesh to be changed to be like him and now I believe I I said in my prayer that I believe that everyone in this building tonight our desire is a common desire a desire to be more like him and that's what our common goal is to grow closer and closer and closer to to him until one day our bodies will all be changed and if if that is our goal then shouldn't we be checking up every hour shouldn't we be checking up every hour with the same fervency that Jacob did that all the saints of old had such a fervency to be close to God to get to do to meet every requirement that's right to get to to uh to take care of things to meet God's word but God the the devil in this in this late hour gives he gives us so many distractions so many things to get in the way and he get and we many times will accept we we create all these little excuses but I I that I just want to encourage you to not to to to be fervent to be violently fervent fervent like Jacob was that would wrestle with the angel until he got what he want now uh Abraham when that angel came to him I I believe uh if I remember right Genesis 17 was was the type of the new birth walk before me in Genesis and then after he got the new birth then in Genesis 18 the angel came to him the uh the the Lord himself with the two angels and began to open to him the secret Mysteries the Hidden Mysteries and when the angel came to Abraham Abraham made three uh he made uh he he he made it three measures of fine meal is what he told Sarah to go and prepare and now we want to I want to turn over to um Matthew 13:33 and we'll kind of look at that because down through scripture these three measures of meal right are used in in different places and they have a common meaning I believe another Parable speaky unto them the Kingdom of Heaven is like unto leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal y till the whole was living right and my what a controversial topic this is right this has been debated and and bounced around in so many different ways will say well this this uh this leav represents in the in the fourth Church age is what I I I I like to see what other people have to say about it and and one person said well this this leev represents in the fourth Church age the everything was eaten down in the in the Dark Ages that everything was eaten down until there was nothing left but you know brother brandham said that there was there was still a root right and and a little bit of stem that was left it wasn't all eaten it wasn't completely done away and uh it it it escapes me right now some of the other things but so many different things but now he says the Kingdom of Heaven is like unto leaven like unto Le and we're comparing we're comparing two things leaven now brother brandham said that the church won't have any living in them right there won't be one spot of living but the kingdom of heaven is like under living and if you go back to your English class you'll remember this is a simile because a simile uses like you stick like in there and you can have you you can say Well when he's angry he's like a fierce Tiger but he's not actually a fierce tiger he's like a fierce tiger and we can look at a tiger and learn a little bit about what this man is like when he's angry amen by looking at the tiger that's right and you can say that about a lot of things this uh uh well right here the Kingdom of Heaven Y is like under leaven right which a woman took yeah and hid in three measures of meal till the whole was leav exactly amen she took the leav and she hid it in three measures of meal one 2 3 until the whole thing was completely consumed by the leaven the whole thing after this process was completed was took on the nature of the leaven now if you look at what leaven is down through scripture leevan is the teaching is the doctrine and in the be very beginning in Genesis they Adam and Eve took the leaven of The Serpent and that leaven produced it it produced loneliness and and despair and everything that we see today but now this is not that leaven this is a secret teaching a hidden Mystery that God has given to us in this last day to overcome now this is speaking of the church and an individual because now when we look at that little picture of the of the children of Israel camped around the pillar of fire we can see the relationship of the whole church of all of the children of Israel together surrounding the pillar of fire with a pillar of fire in the middle and we can see in each camp in each individual tent there's a light in each individual tent now on the day of Pentecost something happened that United began to unite the church it began to unite all of the all of the Believers that before they were bickering and fighting and trying to figure out who was going to be the greatest and who was who was going to sit on his right hand and and they had so many differences and now look around today and you can see in every it's almost like there's there's uh I was reading how that um in the early 1900s there were something like 23,000 different denominations in the year 2,000 there's 43,000 if you just look at the denominations everybody has a little something a little bit different idea about it and they're trying they're how can you take all these 43,000 different beliefs how are they United well they're not they're divided by their little their little differences their little their little uh disagreements now maybe you could almost say that about the message today because if you look at each little church where uh you know we you can almost we used to talk about how when you when you'd introduce yourself to somebody they would check to see what church you're from from because then they' put you into a peg hole of what you believ cuz every little church it seems like has a different belief has a different idea about things but we're supposed to be uniting and how are you we uniting how are we uniting now exactly right now you you may have noticed in the news that the pope is trying to unite he's trying to unite the world now look look how doing it now now we're looking at the three measures of meal now this same way that God is uniting his church is is paralleled by the way that the pope is trying to unite let's go back in history in 1999 the pope put forth uh this document called the J DDJ and I forget what the first two letters mean but the last two are the doctrine of justification yeah and he put forth this document that the lutherans and the Catholics signed together and they said now we believe we come together and we believe that we can we can agree on the doctrine of justification now Martin Luther said that the doctrine of justification and I'm paraphrasing but the doctrine of justification was the hinge on the re Reformation that's what the whole Reformation was about how can the Luther how could the Lutheran and the Catholic agree together when everything that Martin Luther fought for was so different from what the Catholics believe Works versus justified by the blood of Jesus Christ but yet they came together with this document and they put their pin and and they they signed it that now we believe now now look we go from justification to sanctification to Pentecost and that is just what the pope is doing doing because in 2006 he took that same document the jddj and he took it over to the Methodist and they signed it we believe that we have the same doctrine of justification and we are united with you in belief of this doctrine that we we believe that we have the same kind of Fellowship that we believe the same thing now he's he's he the you know I I don't know if anybody any of you have seen that that video that the pope made for Kenneth uh copelan that where where he he's now he's coming with the Pentecost to unite with them in that same process of Lutheran methodists Pentecost and he's trying to unite together on around living around some theology around something that's you can't if you dig far enough down you'll find the bottom but if you dig far enough down with the revelation of God's word somebody that's planted and rooted in him you'll you can't find the bottom it'll just go and go it's so you're anchored in something that's Eternal that cannot be shaken and now we'll find that the church on the day of Pentecost began to be United around a personal experience that God was doing something for each individual believer and he visited them when when they came together they they they were not United they they were United around just just following God let he told us to go and wait in this upper room and so that's what I'm going to do but in the natural they still had their little differences but when they came together in the in one Accord then they put aside all of their differences because because they met something there they met something that was real and I I know and you know as we leave the doors tonight many of us we in the flesh we still have differences in things but there's something that's uniting us the same thing that United them the same thing that United them is uniting us today it's the revelation of God's word it's a personal experience with God is so God doing something in our midst Amen Let me find out where I am he unites Us by visiting us individually one at a time and takes us from being a lonely Christian right to one that has a comforter right and that comforter grows in us uh grow that as as we partake of the word as we uh now I I was thinking about this today this little uh as I was sitting in a meeting supposed to be listening but now this woman she took this leaven and hid it into three measures of meal and and think about now how Bread is made Bread is made by you take the ingredients and you put it all into the dough and you begin to knead and punch it and move it and roll it until you get it in just the right consistency and just the right way now when a Believer needs the bread I believe the way that they need instead of punching and rolling is they get the Bible out and they turn the page and they turn the p and they get the message book out and they turn the page they get the tape out and put it in the player and press play and they get their knees down on the floor floor and they put and that's how they need they get their hands and their feet in the car and they drive to church and they're needeing they they're needing that bread and when you get that you take out the message book and you take you open it up and you read and you you're getting a secret something that was hidden from before the found of the world now we have something so special I wonder if maybe we realize how special it is how special the messenger that we have is how special of people we are to have have heard the message that God gave us in this last day to take us to the goal of a body change now the messenger the messenger that we have in this day was so special because he he brought a hidden message that unveiled that opened up everything that that tied up every loose sin all the all the previous ages they had little questions about how exactly this works scriptures that the preachers wouldn't touch aren't you glad that we have we have authority and and the right and the understanding that we don't have to skip over scriptures that I don't understand what that means that we got to skip over it but we can we can touch on every scripture from the beginning to the end how Abel's sacrifice was accepted to the uh all the way to the Seven Seals has been opened what a blessed people we are and how all these things that God has given us and the Bible says that we should redeem the time I believe we'll be held accountable for that one day if brother brandom said that we'll be held accountable for uh throwing food away in the trash can without eating it then what about the time that we don't redeem that we waste by watching TV and reading comics and filthiness and when when we should be Redeeming the time to meet the goal that God has predestinated us for based on for knowledge of our desire I believe it that if we'll have if we have a desire for it that God has put everything in place he's put everything right in our laps he's laid it out for us he's laid it out just like the children of is at it yes sir you know all they had to do was step outside their door every morning and there on the ground was the Mana it was laying on the ground right there for them and what did they do they begin to complain what complain there there's too many message books there's too much stuff to read there's too much blessing there's too much I do is that how we feel that I wish I was back in bondage with that old oh nasty denominational filth I wish I was back in that excuse me for speaking plain but when all of these blessings that we have and we'll squander it now just like they did they would rather have the old Gars garlic and bitter herbs and things then and what do we do we have all the message books lined up on our shelves Gathering dust we look over there and we yeah we've got the message books just like yeah they had they had the killer of fire in the camp but did they have a personal revelation a personal experience that would carry them over the river Jordan that would carry them over and when when balum came with his doctrines and all the midianites and moabi women's a distraction when they came in were they sealed in enough were they was their faith rocked solid enough that that distraction would not be a distraction and I believe that that's how we've got to be we've got to be just like God was in the beginning when he came down and said I don't care what it takes now he came down and and and just abandoned every pretense of any kind of uh restraint whatever it takes for me to take these people to reclaim my possession and now that's how we have to be to approach him to uh to get our blessing now I'm going to take a break and get some water I feel like a Thirsty Camel I love y'all amen but now in the Old Testament the the Believers just like this three measures of meal typifies a journey the Believers in the Old Testament started on a journey under the shed blood of the lamb and where did they start their Journey but they started it alone and Moses came forth with the Commandment if you're not under the shed blood then then God will come through and the Death Angel will will come through and and and take your first born but now they didn't all come under a great big building they didn't all gather under a great big tent or or even out in the open or anything like that but they went each into their own home alone and they put they had to put the blood over the Len of them their door now if the door if take this into today if the if the blood is over the door of this church then that's not going to do you any good because it's got to be over the door of your heart of your individual Rel you've got to have a personal relationship and God has to see that relationship on display it's got to be made manifest it's got to be visible right it's got to be where God can look at you and say I see myself reflected back when I I see what I saw what was in me in the beginning I can look at you and see that you're hungering and thirsting after righteousness that you're hungering and thirsting for a relationship with me my imagine how what a what just a horrible almost a slap in God's face that all these things that God has done for us and yet we all uh maybe he'd come down into the garden and the cool of even of the evening and find it empty and nobody's there waiting on him nobody's there is that how we treat God but now the journey of the believer starts with the blood it starts there and the journey of the believer back then was so the beginning of their Journey was so important that God took the calendar and rewrote it he said the month of ab will start your calendar he he just he started everything from based on the Journey of the believer there and I I I I I really debated whether to share this with you but um this is something that's really personal to me and you know when people share dreams and things it um you know people begin to get all kinds of ideas but now I believe that these dreams I I had right after I received the baptism of the Holy Ghost I believe God gave me three dreams that showed me my journey and uh I believe they're very simple they're so simple that they really don't even need an interpretation the first dream was I was asleep and Jesus walked in the room and said get up it's time to go and that you know that's really the first part of the Journey of the Israelites was they got under the shed blood and it was time to go they came out of the shed blood the next day they with you know typifying uh they were still under the shed blood they were still under the covering because the sacrifice was continually offered and and so forth but they they came out and they began their journey and they went you know through all the the three stages of justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost but now look at look at your journey and I remember years ago brother way preached this sermon three pools of your journey which I I is still I I heard a brother years ago say you know when you preach don't don't don't worry about what you say because people won't remember it but I remember that sermon and uh but now the second dream that I had was that I was putting on white garments now I believe the bride makes herself ready she has to make herself ready by taking on reading the words spending time with God every day now now these dreams are not not big complicated things I I believe they're very straightforward and it parallels every believer every one of us in here every every one of us our our Liv our our journey just like the Israelites and that's the only reason I'm telling that because I believe it it was a great help to me to just kind of compare that with these three measures of meal and and the three pools of your journey and what the Israelites went through and now now the last dream was really special to me and I I I'm not even going to tell you all of it because it was that special but I was all alone and now in these other dreams I was there was other people in the dream but now in this dream I was alone and I was walking toward a white tree and someone clothed in white garments was walking toward me and something happened that is well it's what we've all been waiting for and and I believe that those dreams kind of parallel the life of a Christian in this day that we're Justified we're Sanctified we're filled with the Holy Ghost but then you know God takes us on up even to a higher form of that that we first we first hear the call just like in my dream Jesus walked in and said get up it's time to go and I got up and went and then then the next stage of your life is that you began to feed upon the word and he cleanses you now remember just before the children of Israel walked over the r River Jordan God said sanctify yourselves for I will do wonders they had to be clean they had to be and what makes us clean what makes us just what justifies us is his word I heard the word and I believed it I was just what what sanctifies US what uh what are all these three pools is the opening of God's word to us it's the word that washes us we're Washed by the Water of the word we're Sanctified by his word by believing it by by accepting it we're cleansed that makes us the word makes us live a holy life that's why in Pilgrim's Progress uh he told the story of how the Christian was just beat on by when he started his journey he was beat on by Moses which typifies the law and I it seems like many many beat on one another trying to get us to to live a life live life live a life but if you'll accept the word and receive it inside of you and let it come let it grow like this L until God can see his reflection back in himself in you then then that is what makes you live a life it's not because and I I have so many conversations with my M wife about this just in the car grieving about how people are so legalistic today trying to work up something that's not real that's not genuine trying to work up something based on a rule book and that's what the same thing that the Israelites saw when Moses came down with a revelation of the attributes of God that will be made manifest in their life if they would believe it and he came down with those attributes in t in two tablets of clay and they took it instead of the way that it was intended for them they took it as laws that they had to something they had to do something they had to to meet on on their own natural ability but God and today today he's making those attributes those uh make manifest in us that we believe that we know there's one God not just by uh uh by theology or by uh by teaching but because we've had a personal experience with that one God and not just because I can explain it but because I know down in the depths of my soul that there's one God and I I can I can relate with my experience the same things that Jesus went through how he prayed to the father in The Garden of Gethsemane and I can see I can see how that there's one God I know it's not just a table of stone anymore but it's a living reality I I know that he's my father the Bible says call no man father because um I I can't give this to you but only God can reveal it to you I can tell you about it but only God can give you a revelation there's only only God as your father so they started their journey and they began to go through labor pains through a journey that came in the Old Testament came by the death of a lamb right that's right exactly and now you know Moses he had to tell them about the lamb he had to tell them that you need to Pro kill a lamb and put it over the little of your door excuse me one more time I'm sorry but it'll go better if I'm not thirsty now Moses Moses identified the lamb and told him what to put over the door over the doorpost how would they know what to do right unless they had a man that God sent to come and explain to them what to do now a few thousand years later all the Earth was looking for the Messiah to come y for him to come walking right and come upon the scene and redeem us from our sins the whole earth was was looking for that but how would anybody know who that was how would they know until one day he came on the shores of of uh the Jordan River and there a man that God had sent was there to identify that lamb and he pointed to him and said this is the one that you should be following this is the one that you've been looking for now in this day how would we know how would we know how would we understand how would we we we were trapped wrapped inside of denominational theology inside of our own ideas and our own conceptions how would we know the second coming what it would look like what the Rapture was what the what the shout of the voice of the Trump was how would we know all of these things except someone would come and introduce them right and that's what Elijah was today to us to introduce to to introduce to lamb as we came out in the Third Exodus because there was the first Exodus back there as they came out from Egypt a second Exodus as they came out with John and came out from their from that Old Testament from the old from the the old way to the new a new testament a new life and now today God is leading us into a new testament a a new leading us out of denomination into into a life of where the word is being open the word is being made plain to us right now so in Matthew 13:33 the word is being open to us the word is being open in three stages until the the the word completely consumes completely consumes the worshipper now it's completely consuming the church as well and when the church is completely consumed and United together United together around the word by the word United together under the shed blood then we'll go in the Rapture right Matthew 13:33 is God revealed in the flesh of his people now in Steph's sermon in the book of Acts he he talked about he kind of he was leading up as he as he talked about his defense of the faith he was he was giving account of the reason of the hope that lies within him and he was telling about what had happened to him and he talked about how Solomon built a house and you know it was in David David had that great desire to to build a place where God could come and dwell and as they journeyed through the Old Testament they made that that Tabernacle of badger skins and and God was hidden veiled behind those Badger skins you know when he went beyond Behind the into the ark and he was veiled back in that behind within the Ark of the Covenant he wasn't that pillar fire wasn't seen again until one day it Walked In the Flesh veiled in Badger skins veiled beyond the Flesh of a man Christ Jesus Jesus and then then the next time we see it is veiled behind the Flesh of the people that were there in the upper room of that Pillar of Fire the little licks over over each one of them as they they went forth because God the his great plan and purpose was not just to Veil himself inside of a building but to Veil himself behind the Flesh of his people and that was his great purpose the the the purpose that that is typified by this three measures of meal because man is not just man is made up of of body and spirit and soul and you got to have three measures to deal with all the different parts you got to have three measures to fill up the man completely fill him up until he's walking and talking in the image of his creator right and what happens when when when when someone says that they're veiled veiled that God is veiled behind their flesh but yet they continue to preach the traditions of man that that speaks of something's off right there you know only 11 of the disciples knew who Jesus really was and one of them had he had a mental conception right and you know I because God was God was hidden in our midst and today he's still hidden hidden behind the flesh of badger skins now I want to I want to read some quotes here just to kind of solidify brothers let's um let's read that first quote Jehovah Gyra we're talking about a lonely Christian who live who lives maybe a a lonely life because you know you really got to find out for yourself you got to find out on your knees you got to find out with a person in relationship you know when I when I started ministering there many brother I got many many brothers telling me different things and giving me feedback and uh saying different things but there's nothing like experience right when you when you do it a little bit when you have experience then it it it it's so much greater than when somebody just tells you something about it and you can be told about but you can be told about what the inside of the holy of holies looks like all the different the different Furnitures and things but when you really become experiencing right I believe when that high priest went behind there and he saw the furniture for the first time the first time he went beyond the veil and he saw all the the gold and Laden things and the the Furnitures that it just the things that he had heard about became just so much greater just beyond real it was the sparkle on the instruments and just the presence the all steer holy of holies oh yeah where the presence of God dwell there right and you've got to experience it now Jehovah Gyra e29 1956 129 and we find him then that God told him to separate himself from his all of his Kindred and to walk among a strange people he's talking about Abraham speaking a strange language and we went through it how God called separation when you become a Christian you've got to separate yourself from your sinful Associates that's exactly right come out from among them my people be separate sayth the Lord it's a different walk it's an individual walk it's a walk between you and God alone and just you and he just two can travel the road that's you and he speaking a strange language do you know when brother Brandon began to speak when the when the pools when the seals were open and as things began to unfold he began to speak in a strange language he began to say say things like first pull second pull third things that things that are in scripture but nobody had ever heard before a new language a new language that's drawing us and pulling us into a closer relationship into unfolding all these Hidden Mysteries like like brother Claud said why why should we be afraid to talk about these Hidden Mysteries because these Hidden Mysteries are what will take us into a body change into a closer walk with him it's say hidden mysteres that now it seems like everybody's afraid to talk about and the things that brother Brandon was sent to uncover and now we're forbidden to speak because we'll offend somebody or or uh uh well I'm speaking plain and uh let's go to number five the revelation of Jesus Christ now remember this Christ in the true church right is a continuation of the book of Acts but the Book of Revelation shows how that the Antichrist spirit will come into the church and defile it that's making it lukewarm formal and Powerless now now this is reason I'm reading this is because really look what look what the devil's doing is he he throws in little things to get you off and and distracted and little little things in your own mind well I believe it'll be all right if this I believe it'll be okay but if you stay with the real word then look what you get look what the promise is as we keep reading now it exposes Satan revealing his Works attempted destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's word right down to the time he has cast into the Lake of Fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is what she stands for and that she can do the Greater Works does everybody believe am that the church can do the Greater Works that she can do the Greater Works she will be an invincible Army if you just give Place give give room to God meet him in the garden right when he shows up you be there and this is what you get you be an invincible Army amen if what if they get a true re revelation of the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian church and by God's spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be powerless before her now I know this is a very familiar quote to everybody we've all read this but I I wonder you know many times we read quotes over and over and over and then one day it'll just something Sparks and then you go try to share it with somebody and there yeah I yeah I already got that brother but maybe they didn't maybe they have just read it over and over and over but one day it will spark it'll catch and it becomes not just a quote on the page not just a commandment on two tablets of stone but an attribute of God May manifest in your life something that's real the revelation of Jesus Christ number six let's go to uh 162 is I have already said this book Revelation is the consummation of the Scriptures it is is even placed exactly right in the Canon of scripture at the end now you can know why it says that Anyone who reads or even hears it is blessed it is the revelation of God that will give you authority over the devil I believe that we're all seeking to to grow closer to God to be more like him and this is how we do it exactly by getting getting a revelation like you can't just get a revelation but you can make yourself available to God Amen you can study and read and pray and meet him in the garden it is a revelation of God that will give you authority over the devil and you can see why they who would add or take from it would be cursed it would have to be so for who can add or take away from the perfect revelation of God and overcome the enemy it is that simple why why is that so because if you add something then you don't have a foundation that is so rooted that you can't find the bottom of it there's somebody can come in with an idea about healing that just just destroys the faith that you rooted in and there's no there's there's no ground to it but if you stand upon God's word then you can stand with faith and say well I didn't say it God said all things are possible them that believe it's not my words it's his words he spoke it and I'm just resting upon it even if I don't understand it maybe let me just claim it and stay with until God quickens it to me uh where am I it would have to be so for who can add or take away from the perfect revelation of God and overcome the enemy it is that simple there is nothing of such prevailing power as the revelation of the word how about that there is nothing of such prevailing power exactly as the revelation of the word let's go to the sisan church age number seven now I am sure that you have noticed that those whose names were in The Book of Life were part of the religious order of that day that centered around the true God and worship worship of him though they did not worship according to truth word like Judas they didn't go all the way right see how Judas was chosen of God he was instructed in truth he shared knowledge of the Mysteries he had a Ministry of power granted unto him now see that's my what a dangerous place to sit in a his church and share knowledge of the Mysteries but not actually take take part of the of fellowship with God now think about so many my you come to come to church here and you're going to hear about the Mysteries you're going to hear about these secret things but have you really have you partaken have are you in fellowship with God or just just hearing about the Mysteries just uh that was a dangerous place that Judas was he heard All The Parables explained when the disciples said well explain to me what this Parable means and Jesus would take the time to sit down with them and Judas was right there among them and he was he was sharing knowledge of the Mysteries he had a Ministry of power granted unto him and he healed the sick and cast out devils in Jesus name but when The Showdown came he sold out for gold and political power he did not go up to Pentecost to receive the spirit of God he was devoid of the spirit make no mistake about a person that is truly baptized by the Holy Ghost into the body of Christ receiving the fullness of the spirit will be in the word all the way that is the evidence of being baptized with the Holy Ghost Judas failed multitudes fail right there and when they fail to go on in that word their names are taken off the Book of Life a fervent walk somebody that's just craving the word somebody that's uh the books are not sitting on their shelf Gathering dust but they're kneading down on their knees going through turning every page searching for hidden mysteries for that bread that came down from God out of Heaven the uniting time in PM number eight God is uniting his bride she is coming together from the East and the west and the North and South there is a uniting time and that's on right now now what United the early Believers at Pentecost what United them was the word that they heard being quickened in a personal relationship the power of God in their life right and that's the same thing that will unite us today that's unite us together so that we can take a body change she's coming together from the East and the west and the North and the South there is a uniting time and that's on right now what is she uniting for the Rapture amen God's getting her ready yes sir uniting what is she uniting with with the word and the church and the I'm going to skip down tonight prag 92 and the church and the bride and the word is becoming so one until the very word itself is working out the work of the brid Grom amen you see it a uniting not no more or join the church not no not more of this but flee from everything and tied to Jesus Christ see it's the uniting time God uniting his bride together bringing it back just exactly uniting the words of his promise the saints that are asleep in the dust of the earth will wakeen and then we will Unite with them the living ones with the ones that's been dead will unite before we even even get up there because the bride will be complete when she get there the ones that's living that's uniting them themselves with the word and those that are gone already did that and it all comes together make one great Union of the uniting before going up there and I I'll be finishing in just a second just be patient for just a just a few more minutes amen number nine the uniting time and sign 1963 uh we see the Nations uniting we see the world uniting we see the churches uniting we see the bride uniting uniting with the word why the word is God and as the word as the bridegroom being the word and the bride being the hearer of the word they come together in Union they unite like a wedding see they're getting ready for a wedding and they they become one the word becomes you you become the word Jesus said at that day you know what all the father is I am and all I am you are and all you are I am and that day you'll know that I in the father father and me I and you and you and me see at that at that day what day this day we find out the great hidden mysteries of God being revealed oh how I like that and I I'm kind of reading this because uh to explain maybe the way sometimes things are preach maybe uh maybe this will help to explain why uh here we value the word so much and how why we put so much emphasis on Revelation and on the word is because of where it this is taking us what's what is happening in the life of the believer is we're studying and reading and waiting on God for Revelation so that the that that hidden Mystery can blossom out and and produce the same thing the same thing that was in God's plan back there in the beginning this will produce himself will produce himself in flesh veiled in flesh and number 10 Souls that are in prison now three is perfe the ministry come to it its Perfection when it reproduced Christ again in natural amongst human beings as was predicted as it was in the days of lot right so that are in prison now number 11 but it's the word living amen there it is if they' only have looked he was Messiah he was the Living Word made manifest and a man that's got the spirit of God in him or a woman lives that word lives right out in them that's the heartbeat that predestinated for the word of the Lord comes to them and they are the words of the people written Epistles read of all men is that right could the third pool be on right written Epistles WR read of all men because the word of God is made manifest in their life and I I'm just finishing up here so The Magicians can go ahead and come but God is uniting us around his word by his word uniting us together so that we are in His image and we can take a body change and I just want to as the musicians come I want to read Psalm 86 1-11 a prayer of David bow down thine ear oh Lord hear me for I am poor and needy preserve my soul for I am Holy oh thou my God save thy servant that trusteth in thee be merciful unto me oh lord for I cry unto thee daily Rejoice the soul of thy servant For unto thee Oh Lord do I lift up my soul for thou Lord art good and ready to forgive and plent is and mercy unto all them that call upon thee give ear oh Lord unto my prayer and attend to the voice of my supplications and the day of my trouble I will call upon thee for thou will answer me among the gods there is none like unto thee Oh Lord neither are there any works like unto thy works all nations whom thou Hast made shall come and worship before thee Oh Lord and shall glorify thy name for thou art great and doest wondrous things Thou Art God Alone amen teach me thy way oh Lord I will walk in thy truth unite My Heart To Fear Thy Name Glory unite my heart that's the that's the scripture that brother random read when he preached the uniting time and I I I wonder as we just close if if you would just stand to your feet and I just we've heard I preached a little message about what's uniting Us and how the the the Le and the three measures of meal is making us grow in into the stature of God's into the into his stature and maybe if if we just lift up our hands if if you want to if you want to grow more be more like God and and uh and and I lift up my hand too I I just want to pray for everyone here real quick and you pray and you heart because it's a personal walk a personal prayer a personal life a personal experience and that's what I believe let's bow our heads just before we close Lord God lord Jesus I I didn't really know know how this is going to go but I thank you Lord God for your grace Lord Jesus Lord we thank you for your word Lord God I remember Lord that pilot came to Jesus and said what is truth and Lord you've shown us what truth is that what the world is searching for and has no idea about Lord but you've shown us these Hidden Mysteries the hidden truth that's been hidden from all down through these ages now Lord it's quickening us Lord to be more like you and Lord you've seen every every hand raised Lord that has a desire to be more like you and I pray oh God that you'll just prick at the on the hearts of the ones that maybe are lagging a little bit behind Lord like that Vision that brother Ram saw where he screamed out get back and step Lord that we'll keep in line with your word and stay perfectly in step with everyone every JW every T that we'll constantly be checking up every hour scouring the word searching and looking Lord for anything that might indicate a problem in our lives Lord God I pray that you will booler US Lord and help us to be more fervent every day Lord God and Lord when you come seeking Us in the garden Lord I pray that you'll find us ready and willing and fervent ready to attend to everything every need every everything that would hinder us everything every problem Lord that will search us and search Our Lives just like the high priest when he would search and make sure that every garment every thing was perfectly in line that we'll do the same Lord with our lives because you said Lord before they crossed the river Jordan to sanctify yourselves and Lord You're about to do a great wonder I believe Lord that the signs are testifying that something great is in the midst is in the works that you're preparing your bride for a transition a you're preparing us for a Rapture for something that the world has never seen Lord and I pray God that you remember everything hand raised Lord Jesus Lord that you'll touch every heart tonight Lord Jesus and Lord maybe if maybe this was maybe Lord if if it didn't sink in night Lord that maybe when they get home by their bed and lay put their knees to the floor Lord God that you'll begin a work Lord Jesus to cause them to become more consecrated more fervent for you Lord Jesus that as every hour Ticks by on the clock we'll become more and more enthused about the word and more and more like you God granted I pray Lord Jesus God forgive us of our sins Lord Jesus forgive us of our iniquities Lord Jesus and Lord as we walk through the doors tonight Lord on our way home Lord give us traveling mercies to get home safely Lord Jesus and that we'll just walk with you I pray Lord God grant it Lord we ask in the name of the most precious lovely Jesus Amen brother Dale 604 in the spiral book anybody have a need if we never meet again on Earth my precious have a need just coming

and rain forever we're in the end of all things is coming down and closing out like our brother was mentioning a lot of you you've hooked on now if you're not then I'd advise you to click on the internet and kind of see what they're talking about that's right you know we don't worry about that too much but when you see the pope speaking to the Pentecostal people and telling them that we're one and the the Protestants there's no more protesting he says it the man said it ended in 1999 or 98 what it was when the Lutheran I remember when they went through all of that see it's there he says we're all one that's right well let them go ahead and say what they want to you know I do believe we're all one but not one like he's making it we're one in Christ but it's very very shrewd if you listen to the man talking very shrewd you can see they're gaining very much ground as a Unity but you see the bride is gaining ground also that's right so just be ready amen amen anybody anything for
