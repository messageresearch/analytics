[1:28] your scriptures where we've been reading
[1:30] in Ephesians we'll go from Ephesians two
[1:33] and then we'll go to Hebrews four
[1:37] visions to Hebrews four remember it is
[1:42] pray for the sick ones among us and
[1:43] things thank God for that part of having
[1:46] an internet that we can you know people
[1:49] can view and things without having to
[1:51] come to service when they're sick and
[1:53] things are going wrong thank God for
[1:55] that one of those wonderful
[1:57] opportunities in the last days for us to
[2:00] have on me now remember that remember
[2:03] the fellowship meeting will be at
[2:04] brother pageants on the third Saturday
[2:07] of this month
[2:08] keep that in mind member this coming
[2:11] Sunday is Mother's Day so we appreciate
[2:15] all of the mothers and things and thank
[2:17] God for that
[2:18] remember the two the brothers on the

[2:27] like we did last time leaving from here
[2:29] Sunday afternoon and be there Monday and
[2:32] Monday night and Tuesday and you know
[2:35] and you just try to house some time
[2:37] together fellowshiping and this time
[2:39] we'll be inside our conditioned
[2:41] buildings instead of being where it was
[2:43] kind of little hot last time so just
[2:45] remember that and we'll pray that the
[2:47] Lord would do it okay any other
[2:51] announcements I know I'm gently wind up
[2:57] missed something but Ephesians 2 even
[3:10] when we were dead in sins hath quickened
[3:13] us together with Christ by grace you're
[3:17] saved and has raised us up together and
[3:21] let us sit together and heavenly places
[3:23] in Christ Jesus that in the ages to come
[3:25] he might shew thee
[3:27] seeking riches of His grace in his
[3:29] kindness toward us through Christ Jesus
[3:33] for by grace are you saved through faith
[3:37] that not of yourselves it is the gift of
[3:40] God not of works lest any man should
[3:43] boast
[3:45] ok let's go over to Hebrews 4 in verse
[3:49] 12 as for the word of God is quick and
[3:56] powerful and sharper than a two-edged
[3:59] sword piercing even to the dividing
[4:03] asunder now not whacking it out like a
[4:08] heart and you got these parts and the
[4:10] cuttin it's the dividing by revelation
[4:14] or singing you know separating and
[4:17] making it where you can understand
[4:19] piercing even to the dividing asunder of
[4:23] soul and spirit and the Jonson Amara and
[4:28] is a discerner of the thoughts and
[4:29] intents of the heart
[4:31] you may be seated the Lord that is
[4:33] blessing to the reading of the word now
[4:38] we've been covering that you're saved by
[4:42] grace through faith hoping the tests
[4:46] dwelled within our hearts and and things
[4:49] we'll try to pick up a few more points
[4:52] along the way and if you will by this
[4:55] coming Sunday read again the future home
[4:59] will try to pick up some parts because
[5:01] what we want to do is to just break it
[5:04] down to the most simple points that we
[5:07] can talk about and talk about our own
[5:10] experiences and things that has happened
[5:13] to us you know in our experience in our
[5:17] Christian journey because what are we
[5:19] talking about saved by grace through
[5:21] faith it's been a journey it's the
[5:25] journey of a Christian you start out and
[5:28] you you travel through time I said you
[5:31] can get that book on the prints that
[5:34] when it's on prints come on the missed
[5:37] it my prints for the house of David
[5:40] the man's journey right there you go
[5:45] okay we get all of our heads together
[5:47] and maybe we can come out with it okay
[5:49] tickle runs progress it's hard to read
[5:52] but it really once you break it down and
[5:55] understand what it's saying it gets very
[5:57] interesting if you'll read it from that
[5:59] point of seeing your life and your
[6:03] journey is a Christian and your walk and
[6:06] your doings and I that's what it's made
[6:08] for all right then knowing that we're
[6:11] saved by grace okay but it's through
[6:15] faith so then it's a journey it's it
[6:21] never stops the Christian journey once
[6:25] it begins it will never stop
[6:29] alright we leave this world I've always
[6:33] taught you what I believe I believe
[6:35] we're just getting enough here to be
[6:37] able to understand what's going on there
[6:40] I don't think it's gonna be a dull thing
[6:44] you know and we won't know and we won't
[6:46] understand now this is just getting us
[6:49] read here for that day to understand
[6:52] dire because it'll be a constant journey
[6:54] the Prophet said he would be giving us
[6:57] his message of tear down through the
[7:00] endless ages see after you're already in
[7:03] the future home and I thought it would
[7:05] be wonderful it's not a knot of
[7:07] something that well we're gonna go there
[7:08] and we're gonna play harps and we're
[7:10] gonna run around on clouds and do things
[7:12] no it's gonna be right here I like that
[7:16] that that was a thrill to my heart when
[7:20] I first heard the Prophet explaining it
[7:22] and I tell you that when he did explain
[7:26] that simply learning in the future home
[7:29] I had no problems understanding I'm not
[7:33] saying understood everything he said it
[7:34] I said I had no problem understanding
[7:37] the point I thought he was trying to get
[7:39] at is to show us because it he said if
[7:41] you don't get nothing he said get the
[7:44] plan of salvation well alright then that
[7:47] then you know we'll get into Nicodemus
[7:51] and and the things more into the May
[7:54] as we go along but now you're saved by
[7:57] grace through faith what is faith faith
[8:01] is a revelation all right now the
[8:05] Prophet said Patmos vision he says you
[8:07] can't be saved without a revelation then
[8:13] he said a revelation says what is it
[8:15] what is he said it's faith faith is a
[8:20] revelation to you if something revealed
[8:23] to you that it's not revealed to
[8:26] everybody else now it is if they're
[8:29] being they're getting their revelation
[8:31] you understand what I mean but he can
[8:33] come down right here in the building and
[8:35] contact each and every person sitting
[8:38] here and be individually dealing with
[8:41] each person in a little different manner
[8:44] but yet still be showing and revealing
[8:47] himself all right now I want to get this
[8:50] point in then we'll pick up without in
[8:52] the message now see I know that I've
[8:57] watched in the thoughts and the
[8:59] questions and sometimes the comments it
[9:03] makes us to think about what's going on
[9:08] now the Prophet said Christ mister God
[9:11] revealed what is the new birth run now
[9:18] see you ask people what is the new birth
[9:21] I shouted I cried I done this I done
[9:24] that right I went to the altar I was
[9:28] there I fell under conviction and all
[9:31] those things are good but that's not the
[9:34] answer to the question the question is
[9:39] the Prophet said what is the new birth
[9:43] well I won't brother dad I don't I don't
[9:46] follow that cause I don't understand
[9:48] what you mean by revelation all right
[9:51] now let's deal with that just a little
[9:53] bit it's a revelation of Jesus Christ
[9:58] personally to you all right now the
[10:05] church is built upon a revelation right
[10:08] the gates of Hell can't prevail but will
[10:10] be against it but can't overrun it all
[10:13] right now so what is a revelation
[10:19] it's hard to talk to people and I don't
[10:22] mean this wrong now I mean it just
[10:23] seriously like in me it's hard to talk
[10:26] to children a lot of times about the new
[10:29] birth as the truth of it now if it's
[10:33] just movements and things we do well I
[10:36] shouted I cried I done this any of it
[10:38] all of that that's well and good but
[10:41] those are after-effects that is not the
[10:45] new birth that's the baby crying when
[10:50] the baby gets here
[10:51] right well what is the new birth
[10:56] now what about a man that could make it
[10:58] and talk about Oh spoken words regional
[11:03] scene he said the opening of the word is
[11:08] the new birth remember we gave those
[11:12] quotes you say brother della I've never
[11:17] had a revelation what what do you mean
[11:21] you seem to be putting it up on
[11:24] something since I've watched you over
[11:26] the years
[11:27] you seem to be putting it up on
[11:29] something supernatural Rim of the
[11:34] opening of the word well I'm glad you
[11:42] saw that because that's exactly what
[11:44] I've been trying to do is to get us to
[11:47] see the opening of the word now did we
[11:52] believe the Prophet he said what is the
[11:53] new birth it's the revelation of Jesus
[11:56] Christ personally to you then he covers
[12:00] in it he said you are part of on
[12:02] Christ's ministry you are part of the
[12:05] mystery and you are to be revealed now
[12:12] what about see we talked about the
[12:15] revelation of Jesus Christ
[12:16] he turns right back and talks about him
[12:20] being revealed in us
[12:24] well to me you know what that sounds
[12:26] like that sounds like that the Prophet
[12:30] was right when he says you accept Jesus
[12:33] Christ as your Savior that's well and
[12:36] good but he says now has he accepted you
[12:43] he said now that's a different thing
[12:46] well you said well what do you mean has
[12:49] he accepted me I accepted him what else
[12:51] gonna do that's true
[12:54] abraham believed god that was imputed
[12:57] unto it but you know what if he had to
[13:00] believe god it couldn't have been
[13:01] imputed it wasn't imputed because of his
[13:04] works it was imputed because he he had
[13:07] this that this that or the other are the
[13:09] great things how he was imputed unto him
[13:12] because he believed God's Word now as I
[13:18] said it's hard to talk to young children
[13:20] a lot of times about the new birth
[13:22] because of the way that we try to
[13:25] present it but yet how could it be any
[13:33] more simpler then what the Prophet is
[13:36] brought it it's a revelation of Jesus
[13:40] Christ
[13:42] well brother Dale I just I was setting
[13:46] it in the in a few we'll try to review a
[13:50] lot of these later I was sitting harina
[13:52] I just broke down and started crying and
[13:54] I just started weeping and I started
[13:57] doing and you know when I got up and I
[14:00] came to the altar and I was prayed for
[14:02] and this and that does it happen alright
[14:09] now where's the revelation you see I'm
[14:15] gonna drive that hard for a few minutes
[14:17] if nothing else what is the revelation
[14:24] do you remember when you couldn't
[14:28] understand the Trinity you know you
[14:32] thought there's three of them
[14:34] but then through the explaining of the
[14:37] Prophet you came to an understanding of
[14:43] how that is not three gods not three
[14:48] persons if one God revealed in many
[14:52] offices you know are things
[14:55] manifestations does that right now I ask
[15:06] you again is that right because you just
[15:11] told me
[15:12] if you answered that correctly from a
[15:15] heart of understanding you just told me
[15:19] that God revealed itself to you right
[15:30] you just told me of getting a revelation
[15:36] you remember when you was in the
[15:39] churches and things you know before you
[15:41] and then you begin to hear the message
[15:42] and all at once let me express it like
[15:51] this to the sisters it'll be easier to
[15:56] get maybe and you fought the idea of the
[16:03] hair and the clothes and the you know
[16:06] makeups and the things you fought that
[16:12] right you didn't believe that was right
[16:17] because you'd been taught it was okay to
[16:20] do those things right but the one day it
[16:25] came to you lieutenant right I can
[16:30] remember talking to my wife about it and
[16:32] I would I would discuss it with her cuz
[16:34] I work all week long them different
[16:36] night shifts and everything in a lot of
[16:38] times with this Saturdays was our
[16:39] talking time you know you know we get to
[16:43] discussing the hire and the clothes and
[16:46] the things
[16:48] and I mean it get pretty heated I guess
[16:52] you'd call it yeah and I just couldn't
[16:58] get her to see about the hire no just I
[17:03] couldn't well something seemed to tell
[17:06] me said you're approaching it wrong you
[17:15] know if I'm proceeding it wrong I need
[17:17] to change my tactics is that is that the
[17:19] best way to get out of something if
[17:21] you're told you're doing it wrong that
[17:23] means you try to do it some other way
[17:26] and it said just leave it alone water
[17:30] baptism we discussed that at length
[17:33] especially that one run because she
[17:36] didn't you know if I to ask her not to
[17:39] cut her hair no more she got no more
[17:40] problems with that as far doing is she
[17:42] done it you know because I'd asked her
[17:45] but then we get into it about water
[17:47] baptism well that ain't essential you
[17:52] know that's we'd get well something just
[17:56] said leave it alone you say well that
[18:02] wasn't God
[18:03] well bless God he didn't made out of way
[18:07] okay that's what I said while ago he
[18:09] deals with everybody individually so one
[18:15] day I told her we was coming home from
[18:16] church and you heard the store it was a
[18:20] dead of winter and you know ice and
[18:23] everything and brother Holland brother
[18:25] Lewis and there was another brother I
[18:27] can't remember his name but you know I
[18:30] know there was three of them you know I
[18:33] told her coming down the road I said
[18:36] they were gonna have a baptismal
[18:38] services coming son dear every what it
[18:40] was would you know what was gonna be in
[18:43] she is a real quad I said brother
[18:46] Holland brother Lewis is gonna get
[18:48] baptized and I called it other brothers
[18:50] know him and can't remember him cuz he
[18:52] did he went on never did get baptized
[18:54] uh-huh called he's too cold then he is
[18:57] the only smart one in the crowd
[18:59] he's honest cuz
[19:01] it was the water fountains were froze
[19:04] this high sprayed up in Gainesville and
[19:06] we had who I don't like linear oh no I
[19:09] see blowing off for her to have for the
[19:11] baptism well you know I was driving
[19:14] along and said jewel brothers brother
[19:16] Harlem that brother I said they plan on
[19:18] getting baptized this Sunday she said I
[19:21] thought I would too
[19:22] I mean that was in shock
[19:27] now that wouldn't no easy little you
[19:30] know that was a shock well you don't
[19:35] want she went out to Hertz what I'm
[19:37] saying they baptized her we had to go to
[19:39] little old didn't how no heated
[19:40] bathrooms and out nothing
[19:42] and a little Johnny house looking
[19:44] concrete made things for you to change
[19:46] in and she had icing on her when we went
[19:50] in to take her clothes off and
[19:52] everything you know she meant it well
[19:57] you know what all of my argument her all
[20:08] about how wrong she was didn't change a
[20:12] thing so Mel spoke right see to me when
[20:25] you do like that then you know what a
[20:26] revelation is if it's a revelation of
[20:33] Jesus Christ within why would we not
[20:37] want to read I remember that or the
[20:39] Christ in history and what is jumping
[20:41] into that and reading it then I'm seeing
[20:44] the great things that he is bringing to
[20:46] us about that what are you listening the
[20:51] one saying that it's honest what is the
[20:57] new bar it's a revelation it's something
[21:03] that's revealed to you well no no I
[21:07] thought if something happened to me
[21:09] that's what happened to you the bird
[21:11] happened
[21:13] my wife had been fully convinced by that
[21:17] time and she walked right out into the
[21:20] water and I was standing there and I'm
[21:23] not joking I had on a long anything no
[21:27] you ever hardly seen me I had a long
[21:30] wool overcoat and I was freezing to
[21:35] death and as a matter of fact I'd have
[21:38] been tickled to death if they'd have
[21:39] called it off I'm serious but they're
[21:45] serious and they got it done meaning
[21:50] something had changed now do you see I'm
[21:54] talking about a revelation you used to
[21:57] believe old but there's got to be three
[21:59] guards got to be a Father Son and Holy
[22:01] Ghost fighter no good old badnesses
[22:03] fightin I the father then I deny the son
[22:06] so I can't do now this kind of I've got
[22:08] to have all the three it's got to be
[22:10] there but then something happens one day
[22:13] and all at once
[22:17] the Prophet says your father your son
[22:20] and you're a human and you look at that
[22:22] and you gone why didn't I see that
[22:26] before why did not see that it was
[22:33] revealed are you listening
[22:38] something was revealed that it didn't
[22:42] make no difference now I've told you my
[22:44] case some of you may not have been that
[22:46] serious that part about it but hey I was
[22:49] a deacon in a Baptist Church that you
[22:53] probably don't believe it but check with
[22:55] them that's our you can go from nest
[22:59] Baptist or Methodist you don't have to
[23:01] be rebaptised but you go from a
[23:05] Methodists or Baptists are from a
[23:07] Catholic or hoodoos or whatever anything
[23:11] you join the Baptist Church you're gonna
[23:14] get baptized in that church if you don't
[23:18] believe me go find out it's almost to
[23:22] the point of water baptism into
[23:24] regeneration that's very close to it
[23:28] because they will not have you and if
[23:33] you go right now and join the Baptist
[23:36] Church right now you're gonna get
[23:38] baptized again or they will not give you
[23:40] your little card showing you as a member
[23:44] in good standing no so what are you
[23:49] talking about
[23:50] see I put my whole life my whole thing
[23:54] the day I got baptized I looked at
[23:57] brother more that's in themselves that
[24:00] see that day I knew I was going back to
[24:03] that church until them goodbye
[24:07] not hatefully but lovingly to all of
[24:10] them but telling them so long because I
[24:14] was contrary to that faith the something
[24:18] was made known to me enough to show me
[24:22] that I would put my whole life
[24:24] everything behind it there was no more
[24:27] to be a Baptist deacon
[24:28] no more to be anything and if you're
[24:31] ever ordained a Baptist Deacon you are
[24:34] ordained for life I don't care what you
[24:38] do you'll be a member in bad standing
[24:42] but you can I'm still a deacon ordained
[24:47] in the Baptist Church in Galesville
[24:49] Georgia and I've been out of there over
[24:52] 50 years no that's the way they honor it
[24:59] like I said they wouldn't let me be in
[25:03] charge in that they can't argue that
[25:05] point
[25:06] listen Church you said what are you
[25:10] trying to get at brother that one thing
[25:11] has never been revealed to you as one
[25:18] God been revealed to you has never been
[25:25] revealed to you sisters is wrong to cut
[25:27] you higher
[25:27] I mean revealed I don't mean just
[25:29] because somebody said don't do this you
[25:33] know I remember when I was first coming
[25:37] to come into the message and a certain
[25:39] brother was coming
[25:40] certain states well all the women would
[25:43] put on certain types of dresses a
[25:44] certain type of shoes because we did and
[25:47] they're gonna get it when he got there
[25:49] now you know that's true no I didn't
[25:56] ever have no fear he sat down in his
[26:01] house talked with him you know no fear
[26:03] of it because I didn't have no fear of
[26:04] that part maybe because I didn't have
[26:06] higher like women but I still I didn't
[26:08] have no problem I'm asking you a simple
[26:13] question has one God ever been revealed
[26:18] to you I mean reveal to you not just
[26:22] your thoughts and something haven't been
[26:25] revealed to you
[26:26] has it been brought to a basis that
[26:29] nobody can't take that away from you
[26:32] well I had rather held that experience
[26:37] as a new birth then to shout all over
[26:40] the hilltops of the world cuz I got
[26:45] something to put it on I got the
[26:49] evidence of that morning I don't cut my
[26:51] hair don't paint my face I don't do that
[26:53] I don't wear shorts I don't worry
[26:56] that's not those are after-effects
[27:01] the birth is the birth of the word you
[27:05] have a brother Dale we've always been
[27:07] told you know crying dude that's
[27:11] wonderful I know I'm an arrogant and
[27:18] hateful when I say things but you know
[27:20] they cry funerals the cry weddings is
[27:29] that all you have is an experience what
[27:33] is your experience I believe railroad
[27:35] don't do that with me please cuz it
[27:38] ain't gonna convince me and they you
[27:39] ain't doing nothing with it to believe
[27:43] brother Branham was a prophet is an
[27:45] aftereffect it's proof or something that
[27:48] goes with it just like crying is after
[27:52] effect of a baby
[27:54] the Prophet said it's whether or not the
[27:57] spirit in you agrees with the word come
[28:06] on yes but I agree well I believe
[28:10] everything that prophet said amen now
[28:15] then what are you gonna do when he said
[28:18] to white horse rider would he had it was
[28:20] a Holy Ghost
[28:24] do you agree with that that ain't in the
[28:29] word and he corrected it right you get
[28:36] what I'm talking about just that's what
[28:38] I said don't throw it at me cuz it don't
[28:40] work I believe everything the Prophet
[28:43] taught there's some things better run at
[28:45] all then when he told him they were
[28:47] incorrect
[28:47] oh don't load our brother Dale now
[28:51] you're going too far I wouldn't be
[29:00] saying if I couldn't back it up with
[29:02] what he said he said I used to think
[29:11] Jesus loved me and God hated me you
[29:13] remember that one he said until I found
[29:16] out it was the self same person right
[29:21] you said what brother Dale you're you're
[29:24] trying to destroy if what I say about
[29:27] that is the truth and I can quote what
[29:29] your prophets say it it's you it's got
[29:34] the problem not me
[29:37] but I'm asking you a simple question
[29:45] when we come in this message we had very
[29:48] little understanding of the Bible but
[29:52] it's not true
[29:54] you know most of that was twisted and
[29:57] warped up but look at it today and see
[30:04] where God has brought you in the 10
[30:07] years 20 years 30 or 40 or 50 years or
[30:10] five years than where you started yet
[30:14] you see that you've been in a journey
[30:17] that has constantly been the word
[30:20] unfolding well I've always just talked a
[30:27] new birth was something I've done words
[30:31] get it
[30:32] where'd you get that teaching from it
[30:37] certainly was not from the Bible and it
[30:40] certainly was not from the Prophet see
[30:47] we swiped by those things when it's not
[30:51] even in the Bible at all
[30:57] that's what I'm talking about now told
[31:02] you my experience for two years after
[31:07] coming in this message I never claimed
[31:11] because I just come into this message or
[31:13] whatever it was doing baptism and all of
[31:15] that that I had the baptism of the Holy
[31:18] Ghost
[31:18] I would never accept that even though I
[31:21] was told over and over you have all of
[31:24] it you've done this you know what do you
[31:25] mean you're saved you got all you've
[31:27] done this you've done that that's why I
[31:29] said well I must have been saved the
[31:30] whole time because no and brother Moke
[31:38] done everything in the world to try to
[31:40] help me to understand and he said I
[31:44] don't understand you brother I said I
[31:46] don't either he said I know you're not
[31:48] looking for some great something to
[31:51] happen because he knew I could tell
[31:53] things that had happened I could
[31:58] about seeing the angel of the Lord I
[32:00] could tell about seeing those type of
[32:02] things I said brother I don't know
[32:11] either
[32:11] I just know there's one thing I don't
[32:13] have a satisfaction he said all right
[32:19] now I'll just tell you one thing did you
[32:23] go out to solve it one way or the other
[32:26] did you believe the word don't see I
[32:29] said yes sir you know that and you know
[32:30] the way I studied it and praying reading
[32:34] four or five books a day and everything
[32:37] else he said just put it on word and say
[32:47] God reveal this to me we were done in
[32:54] Athens Georgia there Neil called
[32:56] hollyhocks
[32:57] building their brother was preaching we
[33:00] were sitting on the front row hadn't
[33:04] been old drunk sitting outside of us
[33:06] only how that ever got out guard with
[33:08] the in in nanny both were we went to the
[33:12] altar to be prayed for and we got down
[33:15] to be prayed for and you know everybody
[33:17] coming up laying hand on and something
[33:22] happened that she felt one way I fell
[33:24] the other way you said well did you get
[33:27] up having all this great understanding
[33:30] no did God speak to you ought to blend
[33:39] tell you safe know what happened I got
[33:48] up from there and I said thank you Lord
[33:53] it's all solved as far as I'm concerned
[33:56] from this day forward I'll go with you
[34:01] there won't be any more of this
[34:03] wondering what this is what that is it's
[34:07] all settled and
[34:11] that day to this day it's been a
[34:13] constant progressive opening of God's
[34:16] Word now I'll take that as my experience
[34:21] yes but you never shouted you never
[34:24] cried no smoke no and I'm not saying
[34:27] you're wrong because you did I'm saying
[34:31] that between you and God
[34:32] but around said whatever point you're
[34:35] born again under will determine that
[34:37] part you know the spirituality if you're
[34:41] born again under an emotional great
[34:44] moving group you'll be most emotional
[34:46] most of the time if you're born again
[34:48] under some dry light form you'll be more
[34:51] of that form because it would be
[34:52] according to your nature see I never had
[34:58] no great wisdom come down no but I knew
[35:04] it was solved that was the end of it and
[35:12] from that day to this whatever started
[35:15] talking to him and then has never
[35:17] stopped I've told you I've seen God when
[35:26] I was 11 years old most of you heard
[35:28] that told over and over so many times
[35:31] you don't have it memorized some of you
[35:35] been here 50 years you know I've been
[35:36] saying that well I never said I was born
[35:44] again cause that's all that the mom new
[35:50] birth has never stopped since that day
[35:57] I've never had any trouble from that day
[36:00] on as I would study the word and wait
[36:03] upon God he would come and speak to me I
[36:11] never had any trouble I just wait on him
[36:17] brother
[36:18] you're not an emotional person like I am
[36:21] alright that's I just explained that
[36:25] different people are different emotional
[36:28] situations and times but what is the new
[36:35] birth it's the revelation of Jesus
[36:39] Christ
[36:40] I thought that this message was the
[36:47] revelation of Jesus Christ is that to
[36:53] what you think that's what I've always
[36:55] told that this message is a revelation
[36:58] of Jesus Christ
[36:59] cuz that's where I've been getting all
[37:01] I've been teaching all the years it's
[37:03] from this message
[37:14] well rather than I just I just still I
[37:16] ivory and that would be good if it was
[37:20] just some form of some emotional
[37:23] situation
[37:35] let me ask you what your prophet put his
[37:37] own
[37:46] he was in the woodshed prayin
[37:53] he said well he saw this great angel
[37:56] come down he never told it like that he
[38:00] never told that as his new birth if he
[38:06] did you come show me that'll end me is
[38:09] no problem because he never put it that
[38:13] away he always put it on the opening of
[38:19] the word remember in the woods he had he
[38:23] was took off a rundown now there's two
[38:25] or three ways for the running explains
[38:26] his Newburgh all right
[38:28] so you'd have to take each one of them
[38:30] something looks like it don't compare to
[38:32] the other come on read it you need any
[38:35] help IEP the one time he took off
[38:38] running down the railroad track mountain
[38:47] glory hallelujah
[38:54] what was his experience was Jesus Christ
[38:59] revealing himself to him
[39:10] what did he put the whole message on
[39:12] Jesus Christ being revealed on you you
[39:19] understand what I'm saying that's what
[39:21] I'm trying to preach talking about it
[39:24] saved by grace through faith through a
[39:27] journey that God has revealed himself to
[39:32] you
[39:43] it's not the great things that we think
[39:46] it is it's to believe God what was
[39:57] Abraham's great experience that was
[40:04] wrote of in the word then he believed
[40:08] God and it was imputed unto it are
[40:12] imparted are reckoned unto him for
[40:16] righteousness
[40:23] David cried out in his soul but what did
[40:28] the prophets say all he needed was the
[40:31] baptism of the Holy Ghost it was the one
[40:35] thing David didn't have those people
[40:42] back gar never had a baptismal it was
[40:45] not for them but they had a great
[40:51] experience they saw visions their dreams
[40:57] they saw great things the dead raised to
[41:02] sit healed all kind of things but it
[41:06] could not put him in the kingdom of God
[41:14] because the kingdom of God is the
[41:16] baptism when the old ago
[41:17] and it hadn't come it didn't come until
[41:20] the upper road
[41:28] but listens hers do you believe your
[41:34] prophet he said what is the new birth he
[41:40] said it's a revelation of Jesus Christ
[41:42] personally to you it's not you shouted
[41:48] you cried you spoke in tongues you get
[41:50] all kind of like all that is well and
[41:52] good all of those things is enjoyable
[41:58] but those things come after the birth
[42:02] the baby cries after that gets here as
[42:12] God revealed itself to you ask you
[42:22] simple question why are you trying to
[42:25] follow this message if he's not revealed
[42:26] it to you or do you understand what I
[42:31] mean why would you want to try to follow
[42:32] the message if it's not been revealed to
[42:34] you I'm dumb but if the message has not
[42:37] been revealed
[42:39] is it been revealed to you than just one
[42:42] God it's been revealed to you that
[42:45] hell's not eternal and it been revealed
[42:48] to you that Malachi 4 is fulfilled in
[42:50] our day and how many more things do we
[42:53] need for to say that those things is
[42:55] made known well I'd rather have that is
[42:58] my new birth than anything I could think
[43:00] of over brother Dale if I just saw
[43:08] visions like brother Branham did
[43:16] yeah
[43:21] you can only be saved by a revelation no
[43:27] no now brother Dale oh yeah where is he
[43:30] and what happened is they didn't okay
[43:32] I wouldn't intending to go we don't go
[43:34] this way pick another part later the
[43:38] disciples spent three and a half years
[43:42] in the ministry of Jesus Christ seeing
[43:47] the dead raised the sick healed all kind
[43:50] of signs and wonders all copper
[43:52] manifestations feeding the people doing
[43:56] all multiplying the food every kind of a
[43:59] thing it didn't say for one of them come
[44:08] on had to go to Pentecost now if you
[44:15] think the new birth didn't take place on
[44:18] the day of Pentecost may I remind you
[44:21] wouldn't it Peter that says this is that
[44:25] which was spoken of by the prophets the
[44:36] great Upper Room experience and come on
[44:41] Church listen don't don't try to pull
[44:44] aside just listen I believe ever
[44:48] born-again believer this truly gets born
[44:51] again that takes a lick of fire over
[44:53] your head when that takes place because
[44:59] 120 in the upper room all had a lick of
[45:04] fire right well then why wouldn't you
[45:09] believe you have a lick of fire cuz come
[45:11] on your prophet said ever how you saved
[45:14] one he's got to save all the new birth
[45:19] to ever person is the same so then how
[45:25] could you put it as being some kind of
[45:27] done this I done that at but the opening
[45:32] of the word
[45:33] comes to ever individual in their
[45:37] Christian journey and dies their new
[45:40] birth
[45:50] remember the disciples walked three and
[45:53] a half years with the Lord Jesus saw him
[45:58] I through his resurrection ascension all
[46:02] the things he come down to that part
[46:05] what did they say
[46:08] are you gonna restore the kingdom to
[46:10] Israel but this time they still didn't
[46:13] know what in the world he was talking
[46:16] about or what he was doing right come on
[46:19] they said are you gonna restore they
[46:26] were still looking for a natural kingdom
[46:30] but when they walked up in that Upper
[46:32] Room a few days after that ascension and
[46:40] all at once here come the power of
[46:43] Almighty God down don't you ever don't
[46:47] you ever think the brother dare would
[46:51] believe in just a cold formal
[46:54] non-emotional new birth don't you think
[46:59] that because they owe you that devil to
[47:01] take you away with that because it
[47:04] sounds like that's the way I teach but
[47:06] it's not I don't tell all that God does
[47:11] with me
[47:12] because I don't want you building on it
[47:14] what little bit he's told me has built
[47:17] too much on it
[47:18] I want you born again I want you with
[47:25] your own experience I want you to be
[47:28] able to face God with your own
[47:30] experience but mainly I won't you be
[47:32] able to face the devil your own
[47:33] experience something that you got is
[47:36] real not just an imagination well look
[47:43] what darker we talk another day about it
[47:45] the Bible said that that Jesus was seen
[47:48] of over 500 brethren after his
[47:49] resurrection and he called him brethren
[47:53] and only 120 made the upper room where
[47:57] was the 380 I didn't say they didn't
[48:01] come on get safe they were called
[48:03] brother
[48:06] they didn't make it to the upper room
[48:14] yeah I'm a firm believer in a anointing
[48:18] of the Holy Ghost
[48:19] I believe ever born-again believer
[48:23] receives an anointing over the Holy
[48:26] Ghost well I'd go along with you brother
[48:35] but just don't I can't follow you when
[48:38] you talk about the new birth is being a
[48:40] revelation in the book of Acts they had
[48:48] many feelings mature you Bible people
[48:54] then were true many feelings in the book
[48:56] of Acts one new birth the many feelings
[49:01] many times when the Holy Ghost would
[49:03] come down in a group of people and great
[49:06] things they'd already had the new birth
[49:15] what is your new birth
[49:23] I wish you would write down your
[49:24] experience if you don't want me to let
[49:27] anybody else ever read it and never
[49:29] nobody else see that with me I'd like to
[49:32] hear your experience of what you put
[49:35] your whole form of salvation based upon
[49:42] I've told you mine I go through it every
[49:48] day I believe in that being born again I
[49:59] know you don't like these statements but
[50:02] you consider them you know yourself and
[50:05] most ministers in this message I'll
[50:07] never touch the seals they'll never
[50:11] touch Daniel 70 weeks they run like
[50:15] crazy for marriage and divorce they
[50:20] won't talk about these things but to me
[50:25] they're part of my life they're part of
[50:32] my life that's one there's no fear to
[50:38] preach when you know where you standing
[50:41] I don't know ever saying nothing didn't
[50:47] say that I'll take one thing about it
[50:55] well let it go
[51:00] I've tried my best to get you to see for
[51:03] almost 50 years that I've been preaching
[51:05] here of what the new birth is believing
[51:18] it in 1969 to preach that the bride of
[51:21] Jesus Christ would be the son of man
[51:26] revealed in the last days but a random
[51:31] as a son of man the bride is decent man
[51:34] see that's where you divide it and then
[51:36] we won't listen you think you're
[51:37] throwing off on something
[51:39] no I'm trying my best to get you to see
[51:41] something you realize that the moment
[51:48] you receive Jesus Christ as your Savior
[51:50] you received a revelation from Almighty
[51:53] God to not make you the happiest person
[52:02] in the world to think that God would
[52:09] reveal itself to you yeah but I just
[52:13] didn't know it that's what I mean come
[52:16] on
[52:17] you were sitting in a Pew like I was
[52:19] listening the reverse nice night over
[52:21] again it's not much a new birth you
[52:24] remember when I've talked about it
[52:25] Sunday and I always told you something I
[52:28] believe that your new birth will starts
[52:30] when you believe but you don't want if
[52:33] you get up back right there in the back
[52:34] and you call this away your new birth
[52:37] don't begin down here it begun back tire
[52:39] the day or the minute you got up started
[52:41] this way now I'm quoting brother Branham
[52:46] your new birth begin when something
[52:50] spoke to your heart you can't deny what
[52:56] I play what about the man that found a
[53:00] book or will you spend eternity he goes
[53:04] to all brother runs telling it come on
[53:07] he goes to build all Roberts's the Billy
[53:09] Graham's he goes everywhere and none of
[53:14] them
[53:14] give him a satisfactory answer he said I
[53:17] give away all my money they said well
[53:24] you need to go to William Branham let
[53:25] him he said you remember when you picked
[53:31] that track up now come home the Prophet
[53:40] said when you picked that track up it
[53:42] said you started right there
[53:43] the man said you mean I've had it all
[53:46] the time he said he was well I mean he
[53:53] just picked up a track and ready he said
[53:56] you made a decision
[54:02] see when you left my curtain you know
[54:04] you give an altar call and you get up
[54:08] and walk down it's not the importance
[54:11] here if you're you praying for healing
[54:13] you you get up by car start this away I
[54:16] can tell you upon the basis of God's
[54:19] almighty word and not back off a split
[54:21] second Aaron sit down you got it because
[54:24] you stood up was coming this way you
[54:26] don't have to come down
[54:29] that's God's Word but do we believe it
[54:35] that way
[54:38] no you want me to Aaron what happened
[54:41] was he was thinking today at work now
[54:42] yours up on the building you almost fail
[54:44] and something happening to you you
[54:45] decided not to go that way you went over
[54:47] this way
[54:48] well God was God was that's well and
[54:58] good if it's true
[55:06] well and good give me the anchor of
[55:11] God's Word I want something that Satan
[55:17] can't impersonate you know what I'm
[55:20] saying I'm not against nobody with gifts
[55:22] I believe in them firm believer in gifts
[55:25] more than anybody in this building
[55:26] believes in gifts and I don't back off
[55:28] of nothing on that I've seen gifts I
[55:30] know what they are
[55:31] let's see most people don't know what a
[55:34] gift is for nothing we talked about
[55:41] saved by grace you realize the gifts are
[55:44] grace you realize God gave you a gift
[55:50] and that's His grace but you know what
[55:56] that don't save you come on come on or
[55:58] knit ones come on
[56:09] I know ain't gonna get very far so I
[56:11] pray that what I've said on that part
[56:14] you will think about a revelation that
[56:23] you're saved by revelation
[56:35] when you got up something spoke to you
[56:42] why can't you believe that was God that
[56:45] spoke to you well the devil can do it to
[56:49] you don't worry about him okay getting
[56:54] him to show before the troubles that you
[57:01] listen to what your prophet said that
[57:05] man had eternal life from the very point
[57:09] of him just believe
[57:21] what about it maybe you don't understand
[57:27] the point I'm trying to get at I'd
[57:29] rather have one word from God then all
[57:31] that everybody else could ever Paulo him
[57:42] if you ever get a revelation truly get
[57:46] one you'll know the gates of Hell can't
[57:51] prevail and I'm not talking about a head
[57:57] knowledge and a hope so earnest like
[57:58] that or something you know somebody
[58:00] calling you out I believe in every bit
[58:02] of that I believe in all the gifts was
[58:04] somebody calling you out and telling you
[58:06] this and telling you that that's well
[58:08] and good the brother branham was the one
[58:15] that said it
[58:15] he said the gift don't say you gifts
[58:29] don't save people
[58:36] but when you realize that giver is there
[58:44] then you realize that giver himself is
[58:48] right there now you got something to
[58:53] stand on
[59:01] well I I thought the new birth was some
[59:04] kind of this some kind of an emotional
[59:06] situation that's were the wrong with the
[59:09] people's that never was get to birth
[59:17] emotions faultless is that simple enough
[59:23] get to birth emotions follow it but
[59:31] maybe you never had a revelation to
[59:33] where God would speak to you and then
[59:41] you realize hey that's discussion with a
[59:49] Greek scholar and we had said a few
[59:57] things backwards and forth and in here
[1:00:01] and he was literally a Greek scholar you
[1:00:04] know he said you know I can take the
[1:00:09] Bible and tear you to pieces
[1:00:17] he said what would you say
[1:00:24] I said I guess you're right
[1:00:35] but he wasn't gonna do it what he just
[1:00:38] said and so I told him I said you've
[1:00:46] made the challenge I didn't because
[1:00:51] matter of fact he didn't challenge me
[1:00:52] challenge brother mote remote didn't
[1:00:54] hear him I heard him and brought it to
[1:00:57] the attention to the whole group and
[1:00:58] everybody knew what he was saying then
[1:01:01] and I said brother you got all you won't
[1:01:06] imagine divorce how many services do you
[1:01:10] want unless you want to three services
[1:01:16] you want us to travel I said I will
[1:01:19] travel some way I'll be able to get off
[1:01:21] or we'll have a representative to
[1:01:23] represent us we'll give you how many
[1:01:27] times services you want you want three
[1:01:28] services we'll give you three services
[1:01:30] three times you know three three
[1:01:32] different times I see you have all you
[1:01:33] want I said well I won't sir is one time
[1:01:39] to talk about the Word of God I said
[1:01:48] we're not gonna take ideas and quotes
[1:01:50] we're gonna take the Bible well
[1:02:01] he never said no more I'm not trying to
[1:02:05] brag on that I'm bragging on one time
[1:02:08] you see if I can see that if I can see
[1:02:10] it in the word enough to know that Greek
[1:02:13] scholar couldn't tackle that word
[1:02:14] because it already he'd already failed
[1:02:17] and blowed it clean out of the picture I
[1:02:20] was gonna let him blow all he wanted to
[1:02:23] then I was gonna remind him of that when
[1:02:28] I did remind him he's the church if you
[1:02:35] know what you're talking about you don't
[1:02:36] have to worry about it but if you don't
[1:02:41] know in the Bible then you're at the
[1:02:44] mercies of whatever see to me the new
[1:02:51] birth is the new birth that's why I said
[1:02:58] to you don't get back to this point
[1:03:03] Jesus said to Nicodemus if you don't
[1:03:09] understand earthly things apart phrased
[1:03:14] it but it's closer he says if you don't
[1:03:16] understand earthly things he said how
[1:03:18] can I talk to you about spiritual things
[1:03:22] he said I say unto you you must be born
[1:03:25] again
[1:03:27] in other words he was telling Nicodemus
[1:03:31] you were born wrong come on
[1:03:40] Nicodemus said I don't understand it
[1:03:43] I got all of my lines and then the
[1:03:45] lineages his right everything is correct
[1:03:47] he said you must be born again
[1:03:53] and you got to be born to water in
[1:03:55] spirit
[1:04:06] he told him exactly what it takes to
[1:04:08] bring a new birth right he turned around
[1:04:16] and left do we know what the new birth
[1:04:21] really is we're gonna get back to this
[1:04:28] and we'll cover it
[1:04:29] he brought a random cover that's why I
[1:04:31] love it that's in the message he said
[1:04:34] when God he's first off God has to call
[1:04:38] you that's the number one thing you
[1:04:42] can't come to God until he calls you now
[1:04:51] that's Scripture we'll get to that so
[1:04:54] when he calls you you accept his call
[1:04:59] and you walk forth with him the rest of
[1:05:07] the journey will be made possible if you
[1:05:10] keep walking if not you'll walk away was
[1:05:16] not that what he was telling Nicodemus
[1:05:19] I'm asking you a simple question as a
[1:05:21] thought I've made my statement I've
[1:05:24] always made it I believe ever born-again
[1:05:26] believer has the same experience there
[1:05:32] is only one experience of the new birth
[1:05:36] no I don't agree with that we'll come
[1:05:39] and show me then show me any more
[1:05:41] experience there's only one experience
[1:05:46] in that Upper Room there was 120 of them
[1:05:53] that was the only experience the 3000
[1:05:57] that came in later down Stars had the
[1:05:59] same experience or else God done
[1:06:03] something wrong I'm quoting your prophet
[1:06:08] ever
[1:06:10] body has the same experience because
[1:06:13] everybody has the same noubar I didn't
[1:06:25] have no experience like brother so enjoy
[1:06:26] having spirit there's no problem did you
[1:06:32] have one yourself
[1:06:33] come on musician don't have to enter
[1:06:35] them have you ever had one yourself
[1:06:39] something you know is real and you take
[1:06:49] your experience back
[1:06:51] would we be qualified to not upon what
[1:06:55] we believe when it took three and a half
[1:06:59] years further disciples to qualify for
[1:07:01] an upper room experience am i right
[1:07:06] it took three and a half years for them
[1:07:09] to qualify now could we qualify for an
[1:07:15] upper room experience tonight if we do
[1:07:22] we go out to come same way they did and
[1:07:30] what I just don't understand you because
[1:07:33] you you you just like it some kind of a
[1:07:35] something it is the opening of God's
[1:07:38] Word is the new birth and the Prophet
[1:07:47] said the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:07:49] personally to you now if you had a
[1:07:56] personal revelation of Christ
[1:08:06] what about it
[1:08:09] this damn well we go have that all the
[1:08:14] way anybody have a need the new bar is
[1:08:21] the birth of the world
[1:08:22] [Music]
[1:08:27] the promise saying they took you will
[1:08:28] get to these things they took that word
[1:08:33] and held it and the Holy Ghost came to
[1:08:38] that word that they had hailed
[1:08:40] [Music]
[1:08:43] that I will learn you learn man
[1:08:46] they're in your new burn
[1:08:48] [Music]
[1:08:52] for you to take the word and believe it
[1:08:56] that's God equipping it
[1:09:14] Oh
[1:09:20] search me Andrew
[1:09:23] [Music]
[1:09:24] [Applause]
[1:09:24] [Music]
[1:09:27] bastard
[1:09:32] water and snow
[1:09:39] watch me
[1:09:45] as
[1:09:46] [Music]
[1:09:51] Oh
[1:09:53] [Music]
[1:09:58] No
[1:10:02] [Music]
[1:10:07] as gon revealed itself to you
[1:10:15] help me
[1:10:18] you're having to speak to you about
[1:10:21] something that was impossible
[1:10:23] [Music]
[1:10:29] and you get hold on
[1:10:31] see it coming forward
[1:10:44] I never beat nobody to try to run them
[1:10:49] away from church
[1:10:52] they never be nobody to try to run them
[1:10:55] to it it's a choice
[1:10:57] [Music]
[1:11:00] [Applause]
[1:11:02] they some of you in this building today
[1:11:07] the 20-30 years ago God told me you'd be
[1:11:10] here
[1:11:11] [Music]
[1:11:18] see
[1:11:20] why didn't you tell me I can't tell you
[1:11:26] [Music]
[1:11:33] my toe wait that's the Lord already told
[1:11:38] me she was gonna be ministering he said
[1:11:40] what didn't you tell me that'd be daddy
[1:11:43] calling and Mama send and that won't
[1:11:47] work
[1:11:47] now you runs on run until you run your
[1:11:52] daylights out of you because the prophet
[1:11:55] of God said God can't use somebody that
[1:11:57] volunteers so don't volunteer run till
[1:12:02] he runs you down brother the hell he
[1:12:08] come walking back in one day and he says
[1:12:10] over I said ok it's over we got it
[1:12:13] solved that's sound like he's trying to
[1:12:17] run him away if I could run him away he
[1:12:22] wouldn't have been God
[1:12:27] you see that's why I say you tell things
[1:12:30] and people want to get built on
[1:12:32] emotional situations or something
[1:12:34] did you tell I'll tell that for the
[1:12:37] glory of God
[1:12:39] [Music]
[1:12:42] cuz I believe that's how really is
[1:12:45] [Music]
[1:12:51] I'm believing so real until he's right
[1:12:53] here with us and doing and seeing you
[1:12:59] remember back a few years ago when a
[1:13:01] brother saw the pillar of fire to
[1:13:03] platform saw it Truth three different
[1:13:05] times at the platform him saying nothing
[1:13:12] one day he come in and he said brother
[1:13:18] Dale I saw that pillar of fire again I
[1:13:20] said
[1:13:20] he said you mind if I tell the church I
[1:13:23] said no I'll allow you to tell it now
[1:13:27] he said visits differ from what true
[1:13:29] what I said you tell it like it is he
[1:13:36] said you was up here and said that
[1:13:37] pillar of fire turned and went back dark
[1:13:39] a couple of brothers and the message got
[1:13:44] the great revelation that the pillar of
[1:13:47] fire was leaving the building
[1:13:48] [Music]
[1:13:54] I just come out here told you I said
[1:13:58] it'd be a good idea if that's the way
[1:14:00] you believe for you to go out to Dover
[1:14:07] in other words that said what you gonna
[1:14:09] do I thought mom stay right here said
[1:14:12] yell but the filler fire was going out
[1:14:14] the door I said to brother he's welcome
[1:14:16] to get a print of it he never saw the
[1:14:18] pillar fire go out that door he said no
[1:14:24] I didn't I said you saw him leave here
[1:14:26] and go back dark you didn't see him go
[1:14:31] out the door I said cause he never went
[1:14:35] out the door
[1:14:36] I said reason I'm staying here I know
[1:14:41] where he went he went from what I'm
[1:14:44] trying to preach for me to you
[1:14:47] [Music]
[1:14:52] he went right back into congregation and
[1:14:56] that's all I've ever wanted is to see
[1:14:59] Christ living in the people the greatest
[1:15:07] honor the greatest talks could ever be
[1:15:09] is to see Christ living in his people he
[1:15:15] said I don't want no problem I can just
[1:15:18] talk and talk the rest of the night
[1:15:20] about that well brother Tate him had a
[1:15:24] dream one night come and told me he said
[1:15:28] saw two snakes I said don't worry about
[1:15:32] it I got him by the tail he said well
[1:15:38] you think you know yeah I think I know I
[1:15:43] said we're gonna let them manifest
[1:15:47] herself then it won't be no problem your
[1:15:57] brother Tatum was here he could witness
[1:15:58] to it you know he wouldn't lie about it
[1:16:02] I said we're brother Tatum here's the
[1:16:06] way I stand I said I might be one of
[1:16:10] those snakes that's going out the door
[1:16:13] you better know the difference that's
[1:16:20] all I say to you you got to know whether
[1:16:25] or not you've got an experience I can't
[1:16:30] tell you about you about your experience
[1:16:36] you can
[1:16:39] but it's so simple you mean it just this
[1:16:47] me believing that's where it starts but
[1:16:54] if you stop believing your salvation
[1:16:57] stops that's why I say what do you want
[1:17:06] to build on any kind of signs and
[1:17:07] wonders listen to the word see what the
[1:17:13] word says Lord Jesus you know he was
[1:17:24] going another way and we changed their
[1:17:25] ways of going in that's up to you and
[1:17:28] you just have your way you help us to
[1:17:32] understand the one thing Lord we believe
[1:17:34] in a firm understanding of a new birth
[1:17:40] you told Nicodemus said you must be born
[1:17:43] again you didn't have to explain to him
[1:17:50] what you was talking about when you said
[1:17:52] you got to be born of water and in
[1:17:54] spirit he knew immediately what you were
[1:17:57] saying but he just couldn't put it into
[1:18:01] his own life so he walked away yet he
[1:18:08] was close enough until you get eternal
[1:18:13] life as a witness for standing for the
[1:18:17] truth what a wonderful God we serve we
[1:18:23] thank you as we go home you take care of
[1:18:26] everybody give a safe journey it's your
[1:18:28] love and your grace be with each one of
[1:18:30] us remember the sick among us Lord we
[1:18:33] plead the blood of Jesus Christ and
[1:18:35] believe in you thanking you have your
[1:18:40] way and got us in Jesus name you
