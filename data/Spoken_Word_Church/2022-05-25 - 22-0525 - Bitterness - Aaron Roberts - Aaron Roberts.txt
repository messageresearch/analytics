say i've made my reservation by god's grace he's extended it to me be ready to go amen well god bless you this evening we're going to look right into the scripture and we'll look into first samuel first chapter and begin first uh first vote for verse four and uh see when they bring it up tonight i got a little interesting thought i don't know if kind of odd i won't speak about bitterness tonight [Laughter] but you know anybody anybody any of the ministers knows one thing you can have about a half dozen ideas thoughts and and they're in different stages of of completion and so the lord gave you a thought and you work on it for a little bit and he said on the shelf and you work on it and you get a thought and sometimes it's just a scripture and then the lord gave you a quote or something you put it aside and and so i i was sitting there well you know i just kept thinking i was trying to find the mind of the lord and for some reason it just kept coming back to this and i'm thinking i don't understand why but you know it's it's not our job to figure things out our job is just to listen just follow the leadership of the lord so um i think the lord gave us something tonight so uh we're just gonna speak to the author tonight we're gonna just read the scripture i don't i don't think i'll be here very long tonight but that's all right you know lord just speak what he has for us and we don't have to be here you know but we do want to give him his opportunity his time so you know we don't we don't have to have saint paul although brother brown said you know good for our sermon's good but um you know we know it's okay to preach 45 minutes too and uh but just the lord have his way with us tonight so i don't get everybody get nervous you know [Laughter] amen let's all bow our heads i know all everybody has i think about all the people on the prayer list downstairs and the different ones and and i continue to pray for brother howell and the different ones and i just believe god's going to work a miracle whether whether we see it or not and that's what god said we're just going to put our trust in him and claim the word because you know what he said if we would believe he would do it amen let's just hold our heads our heavenly father father we just so thankful lord to be in your house again tonight lord together around your word lord you brought us to this place lord that lord that we have this opportunity lord there is we see so many things in our in our life lord in the daily life lord there's hindrances and different things orbit lord you

you've called us to lord we just commit all things we just want to say that we love you tonight lord and lord we just want you to have your will and way with us tonight in this service we ask in the name of jesus christ we pray amen amen first samuel chapter 1 verse 4 says and i cut some of this out because most of you know the story this is this is about hannah and elkanah was her husband and paneer panina was his other wife so uh just just to save time i cut some of that up because i think most everybody kind of knows the story so it says when when the time and when the time was that elkanah offered so he would go to shiloh and make his offerings he gave nina his wife and to all her sons and her daughters portions but unto hannah he gave a worthy portion for he loved hannah but the lord had shut up her womb and her adversary also provoked her sore for to make her fret because the lord had shut up her womb and as he did so year by year when she went up to the house of the lord so she provoked her therefore she wept and did not eat then said elkanah her husband to her hannah why weepest thou and why eat us thou not and why is thy heart grieved am not i better to thee then ten sons so hannah rose up after they eaten in shiloh and after they had drunk now eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the lord and she was in bitterness of soul and prayed unto the lord and wept sore and she vowed a vow and said o lord of hosts if thou will indeed look upon the affliction of thine handmaid and remember me and and not forget thine handmaid but will give unto thy handmaid a man child then i will give him unto the lord all the days of his life and there shall no razor come upon his head amen god bless you you can be seated i don't want to speak on bitterness and the definition of bitterness of course we know it's a state or a condition of being bitter and it says of people or their feelings or behaviors angry hurt or resentful because of one's bad experiences or a sense of unjust treatment often used for emphasis painful or unpleasant to accept or contemplate because lots of times people get bitter and it's not that it's not that they feel like they've been treated bad they just can't process the situation that they're in and so that creates bitterness in people and we see here that hannah you know under knowing the story you know here's here's hannah and you know here's here's a woman that has a great desire to be a mother you know she wanted a child and and you know it's one thing to to have a desire for something and to know that's what god created you for i mean she was she was a woman she was desire she was designed and created to be a mother that was that was one of her callings in life and here she is she has this great desire but the scripture tells us you know that god closed up her wound well you know it's like if you had a great desire to do something and god stops you and then you know then then on top of that you know here is here is uh pene you know her adversary that's what struck me here's your adversary and she comes and every time she gets an opportunity she's poking you she is stirring this thing up she knows what your problem is and i every time she comes and then she's just trying to stir it up now you can imagine that every time they get together you know no you know i'm sure that she never uh passed up an opportunity to give hannah grief about this every time the children were by she if if hannah was in earshot she made sure that hannah got to hear all about it and every time she could do whatever she could to make hannah feel bad is that exactly what she was doing she was just stirring as we say the pot she's all the time causing havoc causing her grief and here she is you know and she's all the time praying to god for uh a child you know she has this desire and but god closed up her womb and many times you know we don't understand why god allows things happen in our lives but you know we have a great desire to do something for god and we we want to do something for god and yet god stops us from doing it god doesn't god doesn't make a way and it's like well why why would i have this desire to do this if i can't do it and so you know it does create a you know a bitterness it creates a uh you know i hate to say the word but i mean it's like it's almost a hatred you become because you become you get to the point sometimes when you can't do something and it doesn't work out you become to resent this desire that you have so here you are you're struggling with this because you're trying to because you know why why would god give you this desire but then he stands in your way and here you are i want to do this well see the thing is many times we get to the point sometimes where as as i was saying about where brother dale's always talked about people when they when they get sick and you see people that get sick and the first thing they want to do is like well no matter how bad the doctor's report is they want to say well i'm healed yeah and they want to walk in that for a while until the next report is worse than the first then they don't they they become to begin to waver in their faith because they begin to waver in that faith then then when the next one comes and it's even worse then it's like well you know i may pass away for the glory of god well maybe maybe this is not this is not for me well maybe maybe god's trying your faith so maybe maybe when everything gets worse then maybe god wants you to look to see are you going to stand and claim his his word are you going to just start to waver in what you believe because you know if you don't have a a a revelation of something because you know what we all have to we all have to take it by faith by mental faith a middle conception that's where it starts you've got you've got to read the word and you've got to take it into your mind and you've got to make a mental thought not a revelation from god but it's got to be a mental thought in your mind that you're going to believe that because brother name said most of our faith is mental faith but he said you've got to bring the word to your mental faith he said until it becomes a spiritual revelation so then you've got to hold on to what god said so you've got to hold on to that and say well no matter what whichever way the winds blow whichever way whatever happens then you can say well you know what i didn't believe the first report and so when it when it gets worse i'm not going to believe the second report and if it gets worse i'm not going why because i didn't believe the first two why because if he said if he is if he is my healer and he healed me from all my diseases whatever comes then you know what if if he raised him if he raised lazarus who was four days in the in the grave and he was rotten and his nose fell in if god can raise him up then you know what if i've got something and i'm still breathing air then you know what god is more than able to raise me up but the problem is is are you going to claim it i tell everybody i still love that because you know i was i still talk about brother dick and you know i was i was praying for brother dick when he had cancer and you know and you know the lord when the lord dropped in the truck that day and he told me he said you know he said lazarus was four days in the grave and then you know he just struck me it's like well praise god you know and they just gave me a whole new outflow because you get so burdened with things and it's like you know what i had a brand new outlook on it hey god god god's more than able you know what i just give it to god i'm not going to worry about it because god's a healer and he's the one that's going he's a problem solver he's a burden bearer so he's going to take care of it i'm not going to worry about it because you know what i prayed about it and i've put it in his hands and he securely got it but see here's hannah every time she's praying and she's desiring this this child and all of a sudden every single time that she comes then every day every year the same thing happens she's carrying this burden of trying to have a child and she's got somebody there that's standing there harassing her and always there in front of her trying to stop her and here you know she got to the point where she couldn't eat she was so she was so upset about everything well you know it was no no wonder you know this panel she was just you know she was just eating this up she was just living and you know there you know there's people you know what we don't we don't want to believe it but you know god puts people in your lives and that's all they're there for the script the song says uh folks may oppose me friends may beset me but still i'll enter in you know what you got friends that that you know they they're your friends but you know sometimes they're like like job said they're physicians of no value they're they're there but you know what they're there just to cause you problems and you know sometimes sometimes the problem is is when we see things come our way you know what we don't look and say you know this is good this is for my good right every single day we get up and say you know praise god this is for my good well you know after a while as hannah having this desire you know you know after a while it probably she couldn't get up and say this is for my good so many because sometimes sometimes you wake up and you know it's just like it's all you gonna do to get out of bed and somebody ask you how you doing i'm doing great and then you want to go find a closet or someplace to hide so you can cry because you know you when you sit down and you actually get before god you realize hey i'm not well i'm not right i'm i'm so burdened and i'm so distraught with this i don't know what to do you know everybody you know sometimes you talk to people and you know everything's so great and you know they never have they never have problems or anything like that or you know we think they don't and you know i always like to say you know if everything's going good for you you pray for me because you know i was thinking about like what brother uh brother diggs was saying you know he identified himself as job all the problems that he's went to and you get through one you got another problem you get through that one you got another problem so everybody said well you know brother brown never told us that we had to we was going to have a a mountain top everybody wants a mountaintop experience mountain transfiguration mount carmel i don't think but he said he said but in the valley is where you grow that's where you really grow he said that's where you find the lily of the valley is in the valleys you've got to go through those hard times you've got to go through the tolls but god has a place for us here picking up in in first samuel the reading the the rest of the the chapter here are part of it first samuel beginning at verse 12 and it says and it came to pass as she continued praying before the lord that eli marked her mouth now hannah she spake in her heart only her lips moved but her voice was not heard therefore eli thought she had been drunken and eli said unto her how long will thou be drunken put away thy wine from thee but hannah answered and said no my lord i am a woman of sorrowful spirit i have drunk neither wine or strong drink but i have poured out my soul before the lord caught now cut count not thy handmaid for a daughter of bellio for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have i spoken hitherto then eli answered and said go in peace and the god of israel grant thee thy pos petition that thou has asked of him and she said let that handmaid find grace in thy sight so the woman went her way and did eat and her countenance was no more sad and they uh rose up in the morning early and worshiped before the lord and returned and came to their house in ramah and elk and i knew hannah his wife and the lord remembered her therefore it came to pass when the time was come about after hannah had conceived that she bear a son and called his name samuel saying because i asked him of the lord amen you know i i want to look at it's so interesting because you know what you know i was thinking about what brother wade was talking about the other day he's like every time people have problems the first thing they do is they leave you can't find them they leave church you know but you know what was so funny what was so interesting and i thought was so good was hannah and and all of her struggles and all of her problems and and all of this that she was going through the first thing that she does when she leaves everybody else and everybody else has had a good time they've ate and they've drunk and they they're they're having resting and all these other things but you know what she does she goes to the temple she takes off ahead of everybody else goes by herself because she's going to pour out her petition before god and you know she goes there because she i believe she went there for the for the express purpose of getting an answer from god i believe that she she was there that she was expecting god to meet her need that he she came and she began to pour it out and you know when you when you get in the presence of god as you know when and you begin to pour out your your petition before god when you get into a place where you know you're not worried about what everybody else is doing you're not looking around to see what else is going on but it's just you and god you know as that song you know shut in with god in a secret place there in the spirit beholding his face you know when you get in a place where it's just you and god then you know then she got into a place well eli thought she was drunk but you know what she was in a place where she was just her and god god she was pouring out and she said i've poured out my soul because i'm so burdened and i'm pouring out my complaint before god why because i i've carried this all i can do you know i'm just so completely wore out from this i'm just so empty that i'm coming before god and i'm just going to pour myself out but you know what was so amazing when she began to tell the the priest when she began to tell the minister of her problem she come in and poured it out and then she began to tell the minister then you know what then the minister began eli began to minister to her when you come to the house of god and you pour out your petition that's the reason brother branham said when we come here he said if you have a need on your heart he said he's obligated he's obligated to put somebody behind the pulpit to answer your question it's not it's not worth it it's in my notes but you know what it's it's if it's in his mind he can put it in my mind so i can speak it and it's every time anybody comes whether it's brother bob brother luis or whatever if you come here then god's obligated sometimes we fail to realize you know it doesn't matter we could be riding in the car god if we pray if we pour out our petitions before god and lay it before god then you know he's obligated to meet our needs he's obligated to come and speak but you know there's a there's a way that you do that that god can come and speak i was thinking of brother branham there when when he was talking about the the young girl that that he he said that was going to be healed and and she passed away and you know he come to god and he said he said you owe me an answer one because he said that she was going to be healed and she died and he's like and you know god just let him sulk just turn him out just let it just let him go and let him go through that for a while just riding on that he said he never did you know and he just stuck with him why did you why did why did you say this and why why did she i saw all this and she was gonna be healed and everything and then all of a sudden she died well you know when when he got over that and the lord let him sit on that for a while and mull it over and get over his chip on his shoulder or whatever then the lord come and told him said listen that girl should have died a year ago but he said i gave her grace for her to get ready for her to be saved and now it's her time to go see we don't god doesn't owe us an explanation you know god god doesn't have to tell you know it it'd be wonderful if god told us everything you know if if god you know if we know what was going to happen tomorrow and what was going to happen the next day and you know every time everything you know we just had to answer had to answer you know man it'd be great but you know what there's no overcoming in that there is no overcoming in that right then you you know because you got to walk by faith so you got to put your trust in him and walk by what he says if you already if you already knew what was going to happen then you know what then there's no overcoming then you're just being pushed along but you know when you've got to pour out your your heart and your and your soul to god and you've got to put your trust in him and say well lord i don't know what to do but you know what i'm just going to trust you and i'm going and yeah i'm just i just see this this seems like the best way to go i think about brother branham all those times where he was out there and he said you know i've got a stack of i got the stack of invitations to go here and there and preach and and all these different things and he said i don't know he said i'm just going he said because they've asked me and i'm going he said i got no certain leaning of the spirit to do any of these things but he said we're just going but he said you know sometimes the lord did speak to him and say hey you need to go here you need to go there do this so lots of times you know we don't we don't have a you know god don't write it in the sky for us and tell us hey we're going to do this or you know you got to do this sometimes you just got to go you got to live your life and you got to walk by faith and so you know it's not where you know we could just sit on the couch or sit in a chair stare at the walls and you know not do anything but you know that's not what god wants us to do and sometimes you know we've got to take things because god wants us to kind of work these things out and all of a sudden you start doing things and all of a sudden that god starts he starts pointing you in different directions about things [Music] so we have to follow the leading of the lord now you know when you when you think of this where you have to you walk in bitterness and you know the the other the other person in the scripture i think of when when you think of having having somebody that's that was bitter about things and and walking and having a having a journey was naomi you know i was thinking about how how naomi and and her husband you know she had two sons and two daughter-in-laws well she had two sons they went down you know they hey there's a famine in the land hey this is so you know what we're gonna leave the land of promise because you know what we got we got to go get eat now we're not going to stay in the land of promise because that's where god told us to stay because we got to go feed our bellies we're not going to follow the word but we're going to walk in we're going we're going to follow what we think now now if we if we follow what god said then they should have stayed in the land of promise even though there was a famine amen but you know what god brought them through because he did now there's one thing that we can do when we don't have any uh specific word then you know we we just kind of walk by faith but you know it's interesting how people they they say i got i got a word from the lord and i'm gonna do this and i'm gonna go here now and you know you know when you get there it's like well you know that's against the word you know it's in black and white and red just like people say well you know what i'm gonna work a job and i'm gonna work on sunday and i'm gonna give the money to the the missions or or or whatever or whatever you know whatever they they want to do or i'm gonna i'm gonna leave this church and i'm gonna go here and i'm gonna go there and i'm gonna do these things and you know it's like well put it in the word the problem is they can't put it in the word and then all of a sudden you know as as you know you can talk to people i i had a minister one time and and this this lady had had went around and she had and she wanted to get remarried and she went around talking all these all these ministers and everybody kept telling her it's you can't you can't you can't yeah whatever she went to this other preacher and he said go ahead and they just about lost their minds when he said that he's like hey she's going to do it anyway it's like now she'll leave everybody else alone because you know what she's going to do it anyway i mean just go ahead i mean if you're going if you go if you want to go in the world go in the world you know i mean you if you want to do something go ahead just like like brother dale said you know what you you come in there and you people come to office and and or by the way talk about people want to come into office and they want they want to if they don't want your opinion they're just going to come in there and tell you what they're going to do then okay do it but they don't come in there to ask you what what what your thought is they're just going to tell you this that's what i'm going to do well then then go you're not asking for the leadership of the lord you've got a desire whatever's burning in your heart to do go you know you're not going to help anybody but you know i mean if you try to tell somebody it's like you're just like balaam balaam kept coming to god wanting to curse the children of israel you know what he finally told him go ahead now he he told him he said it was a contrary to the word for him to do that but you know what that was in balaam's that was balaam's desire to do that and brother brown said he sent balaam out there to do that and so you know if it's your desire because you know what if you've got a desire to serve the lord you're going to serve the lord and if you don't have the desire to serve the lord you're not going to serve the lord if you because you know it's what's on the inside that's what's going to motivate you so as we see we see naomi as they went into the end of the end of the land of moab and you know that well you know she didn't she didn't go to egypt she went they went to moab because you know mo moab's uh they're kind of there you know it's not they're not out in the world you know they're just kind of lukewarm you know they're just kind of church either but they're not in the world world but they're kind of churchy world worldly church so they got they got this little they you know they but you know they go down there because you know they they still don't have their religion but you know what they start getting influenced by the things that surround them and when you get into situations like that then people wonder why things why things always go south on them and here and here they are they're down there and and away from way out of out of their position away from everything they should be in and all of a sudden they go down then they go down into uh moab and they're down there because you know what hey we got to get away from this famine we're enjoying this yeah there's a lot of things going on down here that we don't agree with we don't like but you know what we're making it and this this is this is what that's what we're doing until everything goes bad on them and then all of a sudden naomi's husband dies her sons die and all she's got is two daughters three women stranded out of the place of god and here they are down there and here they are widows and you know and the first thing that we find out from from naomi in the book of ruth you know she's so she's upset and she tells her daughters her daughter-in-laws you need to go back to your kindred you need to go back to your country and and here in the in the scripture you know we know the orpah goes back because you know she she just because you know she was not going to follow any of this you know just like a lot of people you know they they're around it for a while you know just as brother uh diggs was talking about you know they hold on to the word until they get a problem until the word gets choked out because they got a bad situation then they're gone well you know she's there and then she's gone but you know the scripture tells us this is this is from ruth chapter one we're beginning at verse 15 and naomi speaking to ruth it says and she said behold uh sister-in-law has gone back unto her people and to her gods return thou after thy sister-in-law so now she went back to what wherever she got to in in god where whether she got to whatever she was doing she went back to what she knew why because you know that was what was in her heart because that you know hey i'm going back i mean i'm enjoying living in the world and i like it it it it suits me just fine but here's roots she says and ruse said and treat me not to leave thee or to return from following after thee for whether thou goest i will go and whether thou largest i will lodge thy people shall be my people and thy god my god amen now listen to her testimony whether thou diest i will die and there will i be buried the lord do so to me and more also if all but death part thee and me and when she saw that she was steadfastly minded to go with her then she left speaking unto her you got to get to the place where you sell out you got you got to get to a place you get steadfast it says so they went the two went un until they came to bethlehem and it came to pass when they were come to bethlehem that all the city was moved about them and they said is this naomi and she said unto them call me not naomi call me maura for the almighty hath dwelt very bitterly with me i went out full and the lord hath brought me home again empty why then call me ye call call ye me naomi sing the lord hath testified against me and the almighty hath afflicted me so naomi returned and wrote the moabitess her daughter-in-law with her being which returned out of the land of moab and they came to bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest now it's interesting that when you see this here here is ruth and whatever whatever whatever background she had coming out of moab and we know there was a kind of a lukewarm kind of half fundamental kind of background but you know there was something that stirred in ruth that when she saw something something had to strike her from what she saw but she told naomi she said listen no matter where you go said your god where where wherever you're going i'm going he said your god will be my god hey she said wherever you die i'm gonna die whatever goes it should we're gonna be we're gonna do this together and you know and naomi was so moved by this you know she just she's quit trying to talk to ruth because she understood where ruth was coming from but what's so amazing when she saw this then they came to bethlehem the house of god's bread in barley season but you know so then listen when all the city was moved she came back to where she came from naomi came back and when she came back in then everybody said is this not naomi look naomi's here but she came back to where she was supposed to be she came back into the promised land and then when she when she comes back then she stands there and she tells them she said don't call me naomi meaning pleasant but she said call me mara which means bitter she said because god has dealt very bitterly with me listen this and then this is her testimony now listen this is this is this is naomi's testimony she says she said i went out full and i came back empty and not realizing that in the midst she has ruth standing there with her she said i went out full and you know what i came back and no she didn't she had one that came back with her not realizing that she was so she wasn't alone she had roof and here she is and then she came back and then city comes to her it's interesting that she comes back to bethlehem which is the house of god's bread in barley season the time of the harvest she's coming back into the promised land why did she go out because of a famine here she is she's coming back where the word is where the food is where the barley is she's coming back and she's bringing ruth is coming with her and she says i went out full but i've come back empty what she didn't realize that she didn't come back empty but i think she got rid of a lot of things that drove her out what drove her out of of the promised land that drove her back into moab she got rid of that because god had to beat all that out of her all those things had to pass as she came back to her senses to realize where she was supposed to be when she came back then she come back into the land of promise then she come back and then then she walks in and then they begin to speak to her and she's like no i'm bitter you're blessed and it's just like when when people come out of out of whatever problems and situations they come to when you come into the house of god then you know what it's not where people come to judge you it's to where people come to put their arms around you to embrace you and to bring you in to bring you into fellowship which is exactly what they were trying to do to naomi but she said i'm bitter and many times when people come to church and they have problems and the minister is trying to reach out and he's trying to reach and give you something as brother branham says in the message this is from the kinsman redeemer he says now then ruth was asked to do something that was disgraceful but she was willing because she had made her decision he said what a type of a believer what a perfect type naomi the old church said go down tonight it's barley season oh what a beautiful thought we could hang on right there naomi and ruth just come in at barley season barley season was bread season the season when fresh bread was being served and the church in this last days through 2 000 years of pagan teaching and things has come into it barley season freshness of life new bread honey out of heaven the russell russell talk about honey crust bread this is it bread from heaven i am the bread of life your fathers did eat manna and are dead but i am the bread of life that comes from from god out of heaven if a man eats this bread he'll never die and the church in this last days here is brought in right now at barley season so here's here is here is naomi and ruth they're coming in at barley season and here is here's god speaking to them and saying listen there's a place for bread here's the bread of life so god is speaking to her and of her and her need and all she can do is look at her problems and say i am i'm very bitter because what's happened not realizing she's come back and god is trying to speak to her many times we hold on to our problems and you know we as we sing the song take your burdens to the lord and leave them there but you know what we don't we want to have a party to do with it too we don't want to give up control come on but we come into the house of god and you know what there's there's bread from heaven the manna of god is dropped down and when he's trying to give it to you we're too worried about our problems and other things that we're not going to hold on to the word of god but here she comes she comes in to this time and here she is they bring her in and we know the story how how here she's come in and you know she she's so bitter she has all these issues but you know there's an interesting thing that uh that i i noticed i was reading this in the scripture and and and ruth and you know you brother ram talks about having fellowship and we'll get to it in a minute but you know when you when you look at naomi you know no no and if you can find it just show them to me i'll be glad to read but you know there's no place in the scripture that i can find naomi's ever with anybody she comes back in to the land of promise and the only person you ever see her interact with is ruth but you know what ruth ruth got into the land of promise and guess what she ain't laying around she got her feet propped up first thing she does she's out in a barley field why because you know what we've come through we've come through this this famine we've had all these problems and guess what i get in a field and i'm out there because you know what god's law is already provided for me you know the the old testament law told them said listen you can't cut the corners out you can you can't do all these things one because the strangers and the poor and everything they eat from your field and you leave this for them god already had already made provision for them and here they they go out into the field and they start gathering here she is out gathering from from the field and she don't even know where she's at she just knows hey i'm a field and guess what i've come out of a famine and i'm enjoying this hey listen and listen here and all of a sudden then all of a sudden here's boaz boaz comes on the scene and boaz sees her and says who is this woman like you didn't know who it was if the whole city come and saw naomi and this other woman come in i i'm pretty sure boaz knew who she was but you know it's so amazing he comes and speaks to to ruth and says listen don't go to any other field and he tells the young man and until he says listen the young man of drone water you drink all you want you know brother branham types to talk to those young men for drawing water out of the fivefold ministry draw water out and so later on when they're asking about when they're asking boaz is asking the the men about ruth you know they said well other than she spent a little time in the house she's been in the field because you know what you can work all you want to but you know what it's nice to have a little fellowship she's out there fellowshipping but you know what she's working she's getting but you know what he tells him he said listen wherever wherever you see ruth out there in the field he said make sure you leave something leave a little word for you know what it's not it's not all that's gleaning guess what you're gonna leave hand fills of purpose you're gonna leave hands fulls why here's a little meet and do season here's a little meet and do season here's a little something for you a little extra here's naomi she's she's licking her wounds ruth's come out of a famine and she's having a blast and you know what the lord is watching over her the whole time see it's so important to have fellowship don't get tied up in in things you know because you know people they have they have hard times and and different things but you know what don't don't get out of fellowship don't get out of fellowship with god don't get out of fellowship with the believers see you you got to come to a place and you've got to have the right kind of fellowship this this is from the message thirsting for life brother brown says you know some people say i couldn't i i wouldn't belong to one of those full gospel churches they cry and shout and jerk their hands around and things like that that's all right they may act funny but they're but they've been born they may look like a mess but they got life that's the thing as long as you've got life ask one of them if he's satisfied watch the way he acts the places he goes he said you know the bird by its habits a crow and a dove could not have could have no fellowship their diet's different and a christian can't mix with the world a crow's a hypocrite a hypocrite is a deceiver a crow can sit on an old dead carcass and eat all day long and fly out in a wheat field and eat wheat with the doves but the dove cannot eat wheat but he can't but he can't eat the dead carcass why he can't he hasn't got any gall he couldn't digest it and he said that's the way the way with a christian the bitterness is taken from him he couldn't digest the world but a hypocrite can live in sin all day long and come into church at night and shout like the rest of them that's a hypocrite now when you're born again you don't you don't have to be a hypocrite you're a new creature a new creature the gall of bitterness the desire of the world is taken from you oh thy loving kindness is better than life because i long to see thy power like i have seen in thy sanctuary my soul thirsts after thee like a dry land where no water is david was a shepherd he was a woodsman he knew the action of wildlife so i know i'm not gonna read the rest of it there but um i i just i just love that but you know when he talks about the gall of bitterness you know you know a crow and other animals they can have this this gall a gallbladder you know because you know that's what it produces it produces a bile you know for it to break down and you got to have that if you go if you go eat all you know especially if you're going to eat dead carcass i like eating some dead carcass cooked that's right yeah you know somebody was talking about that somebody was talking about uh eating sushi eating sushi eating sushi i've tried it i told him i said i like my sushi southern fried that's right that's my revelation right there [Laughter] but you know i i like me some dead carcass about medium but you know what if you eat a lot of that you're going to need some help and god made god give you something to help break that down but you know what god didn't if you're a new creature a new creation in christ jesus you know what the desire of the world you don't have any goal that gall of bitterness because you know all you know all of that's bitter and it breaks all that stuff down where you can stomach that stuff but you know what if you're if you're a new creature in christ you know you don't you can't stomach the world you don't have any desire for the world like he said that crow now he can be he can be a hypocrite he can get out there and eat anything and just swallow it all down but then he can go out there and eat with eat with a dove but you know what you're not eating that out fellowshipping and all of that it ain't got no part in any of that and it's the same way with us you know when you when you have been changed when you've come this then you know what it's time to get rid of all of the bitterness because that's not that's not a part that's not a part of a christian to get rid of all of that god made a way and if you're born again then that's gone ephesians 4 30 says he says and grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby ye are sealed until the day of redemption he said let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice now listen now this this is because i i want to read something here in a minute that because you know what why did paul say this because you know what you got to be careful you got to be on your guard because there's a time coming that the devil devil's always got his aim at you and he's always coming no he said he said now you're sealed until the day of redemption but he said now let all this stuff go because that's not that's not part of the holy ghost and he says and be ye kind one to another tenderhearted forgiving one another even as god for christ's sake hath forgiven you so when you hold you can't hold on to resentment you can't hold on to these things but you know what don't don't think the devil ain't out there trying so you got to you got to be in fellowship i want to read from this this comes from the smyrna church age message 1960. and brother brown was talking about he said when i first started out as a baptist preacher they come around saying brother adam you got to come over here and we got it and we carried it over here he said neither one of you i stand right between the two groups say we are brothers don't care what i don't care if a man disagrees that don't make one speck of difference to me he's still my brother he said i got a brother that likes apple pie amen i like cherry the best but i ain't going to disfellowship him he can eat his apple pie and i can eat my cherry pie now i i like brother i like brother brown's way eating he said i put class calf slobbers on top of mine if he don't want it why he don't have to you know what that what is it whip stuff they put on you know whipped cream i like whipped cream i like it amen brother getting too old now to eat it but i i that's what i like and if he don't like it well he don't have to eat it that's all right i'll eat mine but he's still my brother that's right so i like that i like fellowship but when we draw lines like this and say no this is our denomination i won't reach over and shake hands with the next man and say god bless you brother my that's when you call fellowship if you don't you get that root of bitterness just like the smyrnan's hat got back there and you caused the same thing all right so their name was bitter the smyrna and church age when they got into that when they got out of fellowship then their name was they were brother that god called them bitter because they were out of fellowship he said he didn't matter what it was he said we're all eating we're all brothers we're all gonna fellowship you draw me out your circle i'm gonna draw mine bigger brother brown talks about in one place where he talks about um when you go through and you know we we come before god and we go in and he said uh nursing from el shaddai and you you began to draw he said and draw in the holy ghost and then he was talking about drawing in meekness and gentleness and all these other things just drawing all these things in he said when you begin to draw all these things in he said then god's got a grubbing hoe he said he's going to grub out the root of bitterness we're going to get rid of that thing when we get in one because when you get into fellowship then you know what that's god that's that's the plan when you begin to get into the atmosphere of god get into the word and you have fellowship then you know what then god's in there digging all that stuff out amen when you're out of fellowship then you know what there's a problem because that's what god wants us here he wants us here so we can have fellowship because he's going to get rid of all that stuff and this is this is one that's what i wanted to read this is this is one thing that i always always go back to this is from christ the mystery this is this is the word of the church that that most people call the word of the church that brother branham reads when he's speaking in christ the mystery he said and i didn't read the whole thing but he said but you remember that the enemy will come and when he does just cling that much closer together the one that the devil is using for an enemy will either get out or come in and be one of you that's all he said don't never clan among you or talk or make yourself clandest we are one i couldn't say left hand i'm mad at you i'm not going to take you i'm going to take you away because you're not my right hand he's my left hand i want him to stay there even the little tip of my finger i want to stay right there let me tell you if you that you know one of the most painful cuts they say is a paper cut and i've had a few of them may i tell you what send you through the roof sometimes and it's just a little i i cut my finger washing dishes years ago cut the whole end of my finger right there off and it changes your life i'm i'm 48 years old and it's been almost 40 years and i still remember that why it changes it changes i want everything to stay where it's at even my little tip of finger i wanted to stay there even every little part of my body stay right there and god wants us as a body of believers to stay right exactly with one another right with one another he said now we've got tapes on that well you've got tapes on what we believe we've got tapes on discipline in the church and how we behave ourselves in the church of god how we got to come here together and sit in heavenly places he said how we behave ourselves in the church of god and how we got to come here together and sit together in heavenly places as as brother ernie used to say we're standing on the promises not sitting on the premises don't stay home i know you were quoting it i'm going to read it if god is in your heart you can't hardly wait for them doors to open out yonder to get in here to fellowship with your brothers if you don't feel that way then i tell you it's time you got to praying because we're in the last days where the bible exalted or exhorted us to much more as we see the day approaching to love one another with christian love and divine love to assemble ourselves together in heavenly places in christ jesus and love one another this will all men know you are my disciples when you have love one for the other that's right stay right together if the brother you think so he's a little wrong or the sister say lord don't let me never have the root of bitterness spring up because listen to this listen that's what i i yeah i've heard this but this is what struck me it'll affect him it'll take the christ right out of my life that poison acids of malice and jealousy and hatred that will just take the holy spirit right away from you it will run him from the tabernacle here it'll kill the spirit of god or drive it away from here hurt your pastor it'll do everything see don't do that you just wax that much closer draw take the buckle as the brother testified a minister here the other night about having a buckle sing in a vision just that buckles on the whole armor of god just pull her on tighten up move right up close one another to one another love one another anyhow talk nice about one another say nice things about one another then god will bless you don't ever let the root of bitterness come in because you know if we allow just the little things because i want you to look at that it wasn't it wasn't it was the root of bitterness it was it wasn't a it wasn't a tree it wasn't a plant it wasn't it's the root the root of bitterness just how small is that when it when when you let the devil get a foothold a toehold that he said he said look look what it drive the holy spirit away it'll do it'll do everything it'll it'll it'll tear everything up but you know brother brown said when he was when he was speaking he said listen he said he'll bring somebody in under the quietness and bring him in he'll fellowship with y'all and he said he'll shoot him full of deadly poison and he said don't take sides with it why don't don't allow the devil to have a spot where that root of bitterness will take place because you know i i'm here to i'm here to say i i've i've had issues lord i i've you know because i i i i need i need that i need that grub hole lord there's been times in my life i you know i i still battle things i want that grub hole to come along i want him to get all that stuff out i don't i don't i don't want any malice any i don't want anything that's going to hinder the move of god that's going to hinder the work of god i don't want i don't want anything that's going to stop it whatever it is because i don't want i don't want the root of bitterness i don't want i don't want any of these things i want i want these things to have that have their perfect way the perfect place i want i want it to work just so this in the perfect plan of god everything to have its way so anyway we'll finish here and we uh we know the story of ruth how how boaz comes and you know he he deals with her and and gives her the six measures of of barley and all the things that how he comes and you know then when it come time to you know he realized that had to do something he had to redeem naomi and you know there was a and because of what took place and and so when she lost everything she had to have somebody she had to have a near kinsman for for redemption and so you know boaz he come he went to the to the nearer kinsmen and told him said listen he said it it you can you can do the right of redemption but we know that that he didn't want that he didn't want to mess up his his uh inheritance he didn't want to mess up any of this so he so he laid his hands off he said the devil didn't want any of that he don't want to mess up his his kingdom he don't mess up his inheritance or anything like that but you know the one that wanted was christ christ wanted to redeem to redeem naomi and get ruth and here ruth chapter four beginning at verse nine it says and boaz said unto the elders because you know he knew what he had to do when ruth came to him on the threshing floor and came and bowed down you know she had a desire for boaz and she wanted she wanted and and he knew what he had to do to bring her back in into full inheritance and when boaz goes and says and said unto the elders and unto the people ye are witnesses this day that i have bought all that was a limoulex and all that was chileans and melons which is naomi's husband and then that's orpas and ruth's husband of the hand of naomi so moreover the roof ruth the moabite the wife of maelon have i purchased to be the one to be my wife to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance because that was the old testament to raise up to raise up the name of the one that was dead to bring them back into their inheritance that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren and from the gate of his place you witness ye are witnesses this day and all the people that were in the gate and the elder said we are witnesses the lord make the woman that is come into thy house not house like rachel and like leah which two did build the house of israel and do thou worthily in ephrata and be famous in bethlehem and let thy house be like the house of pharas whom tamar bear unto judah of the seed which the lord shall give thee of this young woman so boaz took ruth and she was his wife and when she went and when he went unto her the lord gave her conception and she bear a son and the women said unto naomi now listen to this blessed be the lord which hath not left thee then naomi had a reminder a lot of other things and she was bitter because what had happened and she didn't see the plan of god what was taking place around her he said and she shall and he shall be unto thee blessed be the name of which hath not left thee this day without a kinsmen that his name may be famous in israel and he shall be unto thee a restorer of thy life and the nourisher of thine old age for thy daughter-in-law which loveth thee which is better to thee than seven son sons hath borne him and naomi took the child and laid him in her bosom and became nurse unto it and the women her neighbors gave gave it a name saying there is a son born to naomi and they called his name obit and he is the father of jesse the father of david and the name of i was going i can't remember anyway i'll look it up but anyway i was going to remember what the name of obed meant that i forgot but anyway but here is here is this one that naomi had went through all of this bitterness and here and here is all all this that took place and then here is the one that was so close to her and here's boaz giving redeeming naomi to get roof and here he is bringing a child forth under their inheritance bringing them back and giving that child to naomi to raise it's a beautiful it's a beautiful type because you know the old in the old testament you know the old testament the jews were the ones that brought the christian brought the gospel to us to the jews and in the last days this message will come from the gentiles and go back to naomi we'll give back them their inheritance they will they will see the the seed of redemption they will they will see the fullness of redemption as as obed came and was the fulfillment of the word that came to fill with them jesus christ this man this message the word will come back to them and they'll see the fullness of redemption amen god bless you tonight appreciate the lord and serving oh thank you brother they just they're just too good amen they're just too good i tell you i appreciate that how how god is so good to us and i i i wanted to say sister sister julie's here tonight so uh this this would be something for sis julie when i when i preached on rahab she was talking about she said did you know or did you have that plan that when you were talking about rahab coming through and then it was on mother's day and then we got to the end i said she was the matriarch of the kings and i said yeah i knew that ahead of time but i didn't tell that up front because i had to had to wait to the end to tell that because you know it's just like reading a book you got to get all the way through then to find the ending but y'all i was i was talking about sister julie talking about well you know i i was thinking about it today being being been this is mother's day month and i was thinking about uh rachel or rehab bringing forth rahab brought forth boaz and so there and so there's there's the type of of mother being again because hannah was one that was barren but god gave her a seed which was samuel he was the one that uh anointed david and so we see how rahab and ruth was you know salmon and rahab boaz boaz and ruth brought obid then it was jesse and then david brought forth the kings you know when we look back over things in our lives and we think it's we don't understand and maybe we do have times we have bitterness and and things but you know what just
