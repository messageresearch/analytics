[9:31] [Music]
[10:55] Hello. Hi. Hi.
[10:58] [Music]
[12:33] God. And you say now that that's what
[12:36] bothers me. Oh, to preach to you people.
[12:40] Don't remain on in the same condition
[12:42] you've been going in. Change.
[12:44] Now hear me. As I said, thus sayeth the
[12:48] Lord.
[12:50] I've never called myself this. I'm not.
[12:52] But you call me your prophet or a
[12:54] prophet. The world believes that. The
[12:56] world
[12:57] around millions and millions and
[12:59] millions of people. I've spoke direct
[13:00] and indirect to 10 or 10 or 12 million
[13:03] people or more. Directly speaking, I've
[13:06] seen tens of thousands of visions and
[13:08] signs and wonders. Not one of them have
[13:10] ever failed. And that's right. He's for
[13:13] told me things that's never failed to
[13:15] happen. Just exactly. I bring any man to
[13:18] trial for that. That's right. I don't
[13:20] claim to be a prophet, but you listen to
[13:23] me. Thus sayaeth the Lord, it'll take
[13:26] perfect love to put you in that place.
[13:29] For that's all there was there. No
[13:31] matter how many how much religious
[13:33] demonstrations, how many good deeds you
[13:35] done or whatever you done, that won't
[13:37] count nothing on that day. It'll take
[13:40] perfect love. So whatever you do, you
[13:43] lay aside everything else until you are
[13:45] just so filled with the love of God.
[13:50] that you can love those who hate you.
[13:54] I'm just, as I said this morning, I was
[13:57] made my whole makeup is
[13:59] grace. A lot of people say, "No, you
[14:02] scratch my back and I'll scratch
[14:04] yours." Well, you do something for me
[14:06] and I'll do something for you. That's
[14:08] not grace. Grace is if your back is
[14:10] itching, I'll scratch it anyhow. Whether
[14:12] you scratch mine or not, you can slap me
[14:14] on the face and say, "My back needs
[14:16] itch. Need scratching, I'll scratch it."
[14:18] See that's it. Do something. I don't
[14:20] believe in works. I believe it works is
[14:23] love. Works is works is a manifestation
[14:26] that grace has taken place.
[14:29] I don't live true to my wife because
[14:31] believe she'd divorce me if I didn't. I
[14:34] live true to her because I love her. I
[14:36] don't preach the gospel because I think
[14:38] go to hell if I didn't. I preach the
[14:40] gospel because I love him.
[14:43] Certainly. You think I cross those
[14:45] stormy seas and them planes diving back
[14:47] and forth and lightning flashing around
[14:49] and and everything else and most any
[14:51] minute and everybody's screaming and
[14:53] hail Marys are going on through the
[14:54] plane and everything and people swinging
[14:56] in them safety belts and the pilots
[14:58] saying that enough gas life 15 minutes
[15:00] longer don't know where we're at. Do you
[15:02] think I'd do that just just for the fun
[15:04] of doing it? Huh? You think I'd get back
[15:07] out there in the jungle where German
[15:09] soldiers had to put their arms around me
[15:11] like this each night and take me in and
[15:13] out of the meeting until the Holy Spirit
[15:14] began to perform miracles. Communist set
[15:17] with night scopes to shoot me a mile
[15:19] away. You think I do that just for the
[15:21] fun of it? Because something in me loves
[15:26] their humans that Christ died for. Paul
[15:29] said, "I'm not only willing to go up to
[15:31] Jerusalem, but I'm going up there to be
[15:32] crucified. I'm going up to die. I'm
[15:35] going up there to die for the cause of
[15:37] the Lord. It's something love that
[15:39] constrains you, that makes you. It's
[15:42] exactly right. If I to preach the gospel
[15:44] for money, if it would have been, I
[15:47] wouldn't have been $20,000 tonight in
[15:50] debt. I wouldn't been that in debt. No,
[15:54] sir. Because I'd have kept some of the
[15:56] some of the millions that have been
[15:57] given to me. One man, one man sent FBI
[16:01] agents with a
[16:03] million500,000 money
[16:05] draft. Now I said, "Take it back." Not
[16:08] for money. It isn't money. I don't
[16:11] preach the gospel for money.
[16:14] Not for that. It's because of the love.
[16:18] The thing I want to do is when I cross
[16:19] that last breath, the earth, which may
[16:21] be in five minutes from now, it may be
[16:24] in two hours from now. It may be 50
[16:26] years from now. I don't know when it'll
[16:28] be, but when it does I do right there, I
[16:31] want to see in the splendor of you
[16:33] running tall hollering my darling
[16:34] brother, my brother.
[16:38] Amen. That's what's in my heart. That's
[16:41] why I don't try to disagree with you to
[16:43] be be different, but I'm trying to put
[16:46] you on the road that's right. That's the
[16:49] way in. Not your church, not your
[16:51] denomination, but your birth in Christ.
[16:54] Oh my.
[16:58] In whom we have obtained inheritance
[17:01] being predestinated according to the
[17:03] purpose of him who workketh all things
[17:07] at the counsel of his own will. Listen,
[17:09] we're going to close a few minutes.
[17:11] Listen close now before we close. That
[17:15] we should be to the praises of his glory
[17:19] who first trusted Christ in whom you
[17:22] also trusted. Watch this now
[17:26] closely. Get on your jackets, gospel
[17:29] jackets. Hold your ears
[17:32] open. Listen close. I'm on the 13th
[17:36] verse. In whom you also trusted
[17:41] after that ye
[17:44] heard faith cometh by
[17:48] hearing the
[17:50] word
[17:51] of After that you heard the word of
[17:56] truth. What is truth? The word of God.
[18:00] Is that right? John 17:17. You has taken
[18:04] down scriptures. Jesus said, "Sanctify
[18:06] them. Follow through the truth. Thy word
[18:09] is truth."
[18:13] After you heard the truth, the
[18:17] gospel of your salvation. What was the
[18:21] salvation? He's trying to tell them
[18:23] predestinated before the foundation of
[18:25] the earth. Is that right? Amen. To
[18:28] adoption of sons. Predestinate eternal
[18:30] life. Now if you come into eternal life,
[18:33] have you been saved, sanctified, filled
[18:36] with the Holy Spirit, your sons, now God
[18:38] want to place you positionally or so
[18:40] that you can work for his kingdom and
[18:42] his glory. That's the gospel. Being
[18:46] first hear the word, repent, be baptized
[18:49] in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[18:50] remission of sins, taking away all your
[18:53] sins, calling on the name of the Lord
[18:55] Jesus Christ for the promised land.
[18:58] Amen. The promise isn't to every
[19:00] souljourner that's on your road. If you
[19:02] left your home tonight, a sinner saying,
[19:05] "I'll walk over to the Brandom
[19:06] Tabernacle." God gives you the
[19:09] opportunity tonight.
[19:11] There's one thing lays between you and
[19:13] the promised land. What is a promised
[19:15] land? The Holy Ghost. What lay between
[19:17] Joshua and the promised land was the
[19:20] Jordan. Exactly right. Moses being a
[19:23] type of Christ led the children up to
[19:26] the promised land. Then Moses did not
[19:29] take the children in the promised land.
[19:31] Joshua tucked the people in and divided
[19:34] up the land. Jesus paid the price, led
[19:37] them up to the Holy Spirit. God sent the
[19:39] Holy Spirit down and he positionally put
[19:42] the church in order.
[19:44] Each man filling him with his presence
[19:47] of his being. You see what I mean? All
[19:51] in Christ Jesus. how God predestinated
[19:55] this to the calling of this gospel. Paul
[19:58] Galatians 1:8 said, "If an angel come
[20:00] preach anything else, let him be
[20:01] accursed." Amen. The truth, the gospel.
[20:05] Now listen close as we read on finishing
[20:07] the
[20:08] verse. The gospel of your salvation in
[20:13] whom also
[20:16] listen closely. After that ye
[20:24] believed, ye were
[20:27] sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise.
[20:32] Amen. Amen. In the last days, the Bible
[20:36] said, now watch, in the last days,
[20:38] there's going to be two classes of
[20:39] people. One of them is going to have the
[20:42] seal of God, the other the mark of the
[20:44] beast. Is that right? How many knows
[20:47] that? Amen. Well, if the seal of God is
[20:51] the seal of if the seal of God is the
[20:53] Holy Ghost, then without the Holy Ghost
[20:56] is the mark of the beast. And the Bible
[20:59] said that the two spirits would be so
[21:00] close together, it would deceive the
[21:02] very elected. If it was possible,
[21:06] it'll never do it because they were
[21:07] elected to eternal life.
[21:11] See,
[21:14] churchgoing, just as an ordinary, 10
[21:17] virgins went out to meet the Lord. All
[21:19] sanctified, all
[21:21] holy, every one of them sanctified. Five
[21:24] were dilitarian, let their lights go
[21:27] out, five that had a in their lamps. And
[21:30] behold, the bridegroom cometh, and the
[21:32] five that had aura in the legs, went
[21:34] into the wedding supper, and the others
[21:37] was left outside where they were weeping
[21:39] and wailing and nashing of teeth.
[21:43] Be ready for you don't know what minute
[21:45] the Lord comes. Have you what is or
[21:48] represented the Bible? Holy Spirit. Now,
[21:52] do you hear seventh day Adventist
[21:53] brethren who said the seventh day is
[21:55] God's seal? Produce one scripture to
[21:58] prove it.
[22:00] The Bible said that the seal of God is
[22:02] the Holy Ghost.
[22:05] Watch this. Which, watch the 13th verse.
[22:08] Now, after that, you believe you were
[22:11] sealed with the with the Holy Spirit of
[22:14] promise. Turn to Ephesians 4:30. I
[22:16] believe that's it. See if we don't get
[22:18] 4:30 and see if it isn't the same.
[22:20] Ephesians the 4th chapter and the 30th
[22:23] verse. Yeah, here it is. 4:30. and
[22:26] grieve not the Holy Spirit of God,
[22:30] whereby ye are sealed until the day of
[22:36] redemption.
[22:37] How long when you really really receive
[22:39] the Holy Ghost? How long is it to last
[22:41] you? Until the next revival, until
[22:44] grandma crosses your path, until the
[22:47] boss balls you out, until the day of
[22:51] your repentance? Hallelujah. Amen. After
[22:55] you have died, after you have passed
[22:58] into that land, that you're standing
[23:01] there with your loved ones, you are
[23:03] still filled with the Holy Ghost.
[23:08] Amen. Scripture, you're just as you are
[23:11] now, only you've got you moved into
[23:13] another body. You've just changed
[23:16] houses. This one got old. You couldn't
[23:18] tack the shingles on it no more. The
[23:20] rafters got rotten. That's right. So you
[23:23] just turn the old thing away and let it
[23:25] rot on down and moved into a new one. Is
[23:27] that right? For if this earthly
[23:29] tabernacle be dissolved, we have one
[23:33] waiting. Amen. You remember the other
[23:35] day going through that when a little
[23:37] baby's being formed in the womb of the
[23:39] mother and this little muscles are
[23:40] kicking and jumping and going on, but
[23:42] just as soon as the mother drops the
[23:44] baby and the baby's to earth, the first
[23:46] thing there is a spiritual body to catch
[23:49] that little natural
[23:51] body. Maybe the doctor will give it a
[23:53] like that or something or shake
[23:56] it when and immediately right to that
[23:59] mother's breast. It'll go moving its
[24:02] little head up and down on the mother's
[24:03] breast to make those milk veins bring
[24:06] milk on a little calf. As soon as it's
[24:09] dropped from the mother, it'll get up on
[24:10] its little knees. After a few minutes,
[24:12] what will it do? Move right straight
[24:14] back around. Get a hold of that mother
[24:15] going to shake it little head up and
[24:16] down like that and get it.
[24:19] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Yes sir. When
[24:22] this natural body comes into earth,
[24:24] there's a spiritual body waiting for it.
[24:26] And when this natural body is dropped on
[24:29] the ground, hallelujah. There is one
[24:31] waiting on earth.
[24:34] Praise the Lord. We just move from one
[24:37] end to another. We change our dwelling
[24:39] places.
[24:41] This mortal must put on immortality.
[24:43] This spiritual, this corruption put on
[24:45] incorruption. this old wrinkled up frog
[24:49] stooped over body, but it won't change
[24:51] its appearance at all. I mean, when it
[24:54] gets out of you'll still have the same
[24:55] spirit.
[24:57] Let me give you a little something
[24:58] sounds twisting to you, but it's the
[25:00] Bible. Then I'll give you one untwisted
[25:03] for you. Watch this one. One old Saul,
[25:07] the king that the old big old
[25:09] denominational preacher down there at
[25:10] that time, you know, got head and
[25:12] shoulders above them all and was afraid.
[25:14] He didn't know nothing about the
[25:16] supernatural. David had to come and
[25:18] deliver the lamb out of the lion's
[25:20] mouth, kill Goliath, watch
[25:23] him. He got so far back from God, he got
[25:26] the hat in this holy royal preacher. And
[25:28] instead of being for him to try to help
[25:30] him, he turned against him. If that just
[25:33] isn't a picture exactly exactly picture
[25:39] turned right from him. How many is in
[25:41] here when I left on my first trip and
[25:43] preached David at slain Goliath? Well, I
[25:46] left. Many of you feel the old-timers.
[25:49] I'm fixing to leave again on this.
[25:50] Remember what see what just come around
[25:52] last Sunday, which is moving right into
[25:54] another phase. David's second campaign,
[25:57] second phase of his ministry. It's
[25:59] exactly right. Which then he become king
[26:01] over Israel. Notice the ministry now is
[26:04] moving out into a greater phase, coming
[26:06] out greater. So did David. I noticed
[26:09] this as he come
[26:11] David. Oh, when God had David come out
[26:16] there and slay the lion, notice and slay
[26:20] the bear, then slay the Philistine. Now,
[26:23] there come a time when God gave a evil
[26:26] spirit over to this old boy and I to
[26:30] what? To hate David. And I
[26:33] believe now these tapes. Now, listen,
[26:35] brethren, you own these tapes. If you
[26:37] disagree with me, forgive me. See, I
[26:40] love you. I'm going to meet you over
[26:41] yonder anyhow. See, cuz if you're a man
[26:44] of God, I'm going to meet you anyhow.
[26:46] But I want to say this. Here's the
[26:49] reason. Just because that Saul saw that
[26:53] David had something that he didn't have.
[26:57] Then what happened? A little old ruddy
[27:00] draw over. The Bible said he was ruddy.
[27:03] That wasn't a very fair child. Rudy is
[27:06] just a little old drawed up sort of a
[27:07] fell and he went out there and Saul well
[27:10] he put Saul's armor on him and I imagine
[27:12] the shield come plumbed down over his
[27:14] feet and he said take this stuff off of
[27:16] meraise I I maybe give him a doctor's
[27:19] degree a PhD or LLD or something you
[27:22] know he said I don't know nothing about
[27:24] that stuff because I haven't proved it
[27:26] let me have this what I know what I'm
[27:28] doing with Yes sir he took the slingshot
[27:32] and it made David mad because the
[27:34] daughters, the churches, the churches
[27:38] was singing. Saul might have killed his
[27:40] thousands, but David killed his tens of
[27:42] thousands. Then he got jealous. That's
[27:45] it. That old Jesus name stuff. There's
[27:47] nothing to it.
[27:49] That's right. And what did God do to
[27:51] him? God sent an evil spirit upon him.
[27:56] Amen.
[27:57] Exactly. What's happened? To hate David.
[28:01] And he hated David without a cause.
[28:04] David could have rung his neck a few
[28:06] times.
[28:08] He could, but he just let it go. He just
[28:10] never said nothing. He sure could have
[28:12] done it. He went over, cut the tail of
[28:13] his coat off one night, come back, said,
[28:15] "Look at Y." You see? Yes, sir. He could
[28:18] have done it. But he just let him alone.
[28:20] He could have broke his congregation up
[28:21] and scattered him, started an
[28:22] organization of himself if he wanted to,
[28:25] but he didn't do it. He just let Saul go
[28:26] on and let God do the fighting. Yes,
[28:29] sir. So as he went on out and the
[28:31] campaign finished on it and got on that
[28:33] evil spirit God so that Saul couldn't
[28:35] get no answer from God. After a while he
[28:38] the spirit of the Lord had departed from
[28:40] him. And oh Samuel the one that they'll
[28:43] turn down. The one that really was the
[28:46] voice of God to him. The one that said
[28:49] to him before they even wanted to act
[28:51] like the world. Why does a church want
[28:53] to act like the world? Yeah. Why does
[28:57] Pentecostal baptized Holy Ghost
[28:59] experienced Methodist and Baptist and
[29:01] Presbyterian want to act like the world?
[29:05] Why do they do it? I don't know. I I I
[29:08] just can't understand it. You say,
[29:10] "Well, this fun to play poker. Just a
[29:12] little bit for fun." Just little penny
[29:15] or what you call it. It's a sin. You
[29:18] shouldn't have them things in your
[29:20] house.
[29:21] Well, it's no harm. Take a little bit of
[29:23] glass of beer. Uh, we just got a few,
[29:25] man. My wife has a few in the afternoon
[29:27] and the first thing you know, your
[29:28] children's got a few.
[29:31] Sure it is.
[29:32] And you women.
[29:36] Devil's just made a That's what he did
[29:38] in the beginning. And he certainly has
[29:40] made a target out of you sisters. He
[29:42] just does that just because he knows
[29:44] what he can do. He can deceive a woman a
[29:48] thousand times quicker than a man. I
[29:49] know that hurts your feelings, but
[29:50] that's the truth. Exactly. That's what
[29:52] he done in the garden of Eden. He can
[29:54] make she was honest. She was sincere,
[29:57] but she was deceived. Adam was not
[30:00] deceived. The Bible said he wasn't
[30:02] deceiving, but she was deceiving.
[30:05] So, he can deceive her. And yet pastors
[30:09] will go right out, ordinating women
[30:10] preachers, put them out over
[30:12] congregations like that, and this Bible
[30:14] condemns it from Genesis to Revelation.
[30:18] Well, it's all right. It's all right.
[30:19] They got they preach the same as I know
[30:21] that's right. Like somebody starts
[30:23] speaking in tongues one time. I just
[30:24] kept on
[30:25] preaching. And when I got outside, a
[30:28] woman said to my son said, "I've got a
[30:30] message to give tomorrow night." Said,
[30:32] "While your daddy comes on the
[30:33] platform," said well message? What do
[30:35] you mean? And that night when got ready
[30:37] when I was fixing to make the alter
[30:38] call, she fixed her hair all up and
[30:40] pulled up her stockings and everything,
[30:41] got ready, jumped up middle form. You
[30:43] jump up and down, spoke in tongues and
[30:44] prophesied. I just kept on preaching,
[30:46] make my altar call. Well, I never re
[30:49] respected it, but it wasn't right. So
[30:51] then, well, the Bible said not to said
[30:53] the the spirit of the prophets are
[30:55] subject to the prophet. Amen. God's on
[30:58] the God speaking at the platform. Let
[31:00] him speak. Paul said something be
[31:02] revealed to one. Let him hold his peace
[31:04] till the next finishes. That's right.
[31:07] Amen. Now then, when I got outside,
[31:09] these people said, a big bunch of people
[31:11] said, "You grieve the Holy Ghost
[31:12] tonight." I said, "What doing? What did
[31:13] I do?" Said, "Well, when that sister
[31:15] gave that message, hallelujah." said
[31:17] that. Well, I said I was preaching. She
[31:19] was out of order. Oh, said that was
[31:21] fresh right off the throne. That's
[31:22] fresher than what she was
[31:25] preaching. Now, that just shows that
[31:29] shows either this, and I say it to your
[31:32] respects, either
[31:33] insanity or either disrespect or
[31:36] illiterate teaching that don't know more
[31:39] about God than a rabbit knows about
[31:41] snowshoes. Now, that I don't say that to
[31:43] be a a silly remark because there's no
[31:45] place to joke, but that's that's exactly
[31:47] the truth. A person that would know that
[31:50] God's not an author of confusion.
[31:53] He's a peace.
[31:56] The Bible, they don't know. All they
[31:58] know how to do is jump up and down,
[31:59] speak in tong, say, "I got the Holy
[32:01] Ghost." Hallelujah. I've stood and seen
[32:02] in Africa witch doctors and things they
[32:04] speak by the 500 thousands of them at a
[32:06] time jumping up and down blood all over
[32:08] their faces speaking in tongues and
[32:10] drink blood out of a human skull call on
[32:13] the devil and speak in tongues and yet
[32:16] speaking in tonesues is a gift of God
[32:19] but that's not the infallible proof of
[32:20] the Holy Ghost that
[32:23] I do believe that all inspired saints
[32:25] speak with tongues I believe a man
[32:28] sometime when you get so inspired with
[32:30] God cuz you will speak with tongues. I
[32:32] believe that. But I don't believe that's
[32:33] any sign you got the Holy Ghost. Amen.
[32:35] Yes, sir. I believe there's times when
[32:37] you have faith. A person can walk out
[32:39] and lay hands on a little kid that's got
[32:41] a cancer and 50 preachers have prayed
[32:42] for it and it be healed because that
[32:44] mother has faith for that child. God's
[32:46] given it to her. She's a member of the
[32:48] body of Christ. Yes, sir. I believe
[32:50] that. I've seen that done and I know
[32:53] that's true. But what it is is get the
[32:56] church in order, setting order so we can
[32:59] work. Now, let's finish the rest of this
[33:01] verse here before we go. After that, you
[33:04] receive your sealed with the Holy Spirit
[33:07] of promise. Seal. What is a
[33:12] seal? What is a seal? A seal is first
[33:18] thing it shows is a work that has been
[33:23] completed. A completed work. The next
[33:26] thing it shows is
[33:28] ownership. And the next thing it shows
[33:30] is
[33:32] security, keeping it. Say, for instance,
[33:35] I used to work for the Pennsylvania
[33:36] Railroad. I used to work with my father
[33:38] on the railroad. We would load cars and
[33:41] we'd put in down here at this packing
[33:44] company. We'd put in 10 cans and we'd
[33:46] set some up here and some down here and
[33:48] some up this way. But before that car
[33:51] was ever sealed, the inspector come
[33:53] through
[33:54] there and he pushed on it, shoved on
[33:58] this one, shook that one. Ah, condemn
[34:03] it. They'll break all the pieces before
[34:05] they get there. Condemn it. Take it out.
[34:08] Do it over. Inspector, condemn the car.
[34:11] The Holy Ghost is the inspector. Amen.
[34:14] He shake you a little bit and you
[34:16] rattle.
[34:20] You believe all the word of God. I don't
[34:21] believe that old Jesus name stuff.
[34:23] Condemning. Amen. You'll rattle.
[34:28] I don't believe in divine healing. You
[34:29] know such a thing. Still rattled. Kick
[34:32] him out. Do you believe Jesus Christ the
[34:34] same yesterday? Well, in some way you
[34:37] rattle. Kick it out. Ain't ready yet.
[34:40] Yes, sir. Brother, when it's ready to
[34:42] say, amen. Have you received the Holy
[34:44] Ghost? Amen. Has everything been
[34:47] completed? Amen. Then what does the
[34:49] inspector do? Everything's packed in
[34:52] good and tight, full of the gospel. Oh,
[34:55] every word of God is good. Everything is
[34:58] perfect. I believe every word. Amen.
[35:00] Amen. Amen. Do you believe that God
[35:03] still heals? Amen. You believe Jesus
[35:05] yesterday and forever? Amen. You believe
[35:08] the Holy Ghost is just as real as it
[35:09] ever was. Amen. You believe the same
[35:11] spirit fell on Paul's office on us?
[35:13] Amen. You believe it does the same
[35:15] things on us that did on them? Amen. Uh
[35:18] oh, she's getting tight now.
[35:20] Getting tight now. We're ready to close
[35:22] the door. All right. Then the inspector
[35:25] closes the door. What does he do? He
[35:27] puts a seal on it. Then he gets down
[35:29] here. He gets a hold of these little
[35:30] pliers of a thing. Reaches over there on
[35:32] this little thing and seals that. You'd
[35:35] better not break it.
[35:38] Amen. If that that car is destination is
[35:41] Boston, it cannot be broken. It would be
[35:44] a penitentiary offense to break that
[35:47] seal until it gets to Boston. And a man
[35:50] that has the authority can open that
[35:52] seal in him only.
[35:54] That's right. It's owned by this certain
[35:57] certain railroad company. It's their
[36:00] seal. It's their assurance that this car
[36:03] has been packed. This car is ready. It
[36:06] belongs to them. They couldn't put the
[36:09] BNO on the Pennsylvania. You've got to
[36:11] be sealed. And when it's sealed, and
[36:14] when the Christian is packed with the
[36:16] gospel, filled with the goodness of God,
[36:18] all the good things of God laying in him
[36:21] with an open heart, ready to work,
[36:23] willing to be positionally pleased, do
[36:26] anything that the Holy Spirit tells him
[36:27] to do, pass from death unto life,
[36:30] sanctified from all the things of the
[36:32] world, walking in the light as the light
[36:34] comes to him. Moving on, he's ready.
[36:37] Then God shuts the door of the world
[36:38] behind him. He kicks it together like
[36:40] that and seals him with the Holy Ghost
[36:43] of promise.
[36:46] Hallelujah. How long until the
[36:49] destination? Amen. Don't get him out
[36:52] here on the railroad track and break it
[36:53] open and see if everything's all right
[36:54] again. It's all right. Just leave it
[36:56] alone. The inspector has done inspected
[36:59] it.
[37:01] Amen. How long are you sealed? Until the
[37:04] day of your redemption. Amen. That's how
[37:07] long you're sealed.
[37:09] Well, when you die then, brother
[37:10] Brandon, what about if you die? You said
[37:12] you still have it. You have it forever.
[37:14] Amen. Where does life begin? At the
[37:17] altar,
[37:19] right there, you see a little bit of
[37:20] shadow. That's the shadow, the seal of
[37:23] the Holy Spirit. Then it's a shadow of
[37:26] the shadows of the shadows, as I said
[37:27] the other day. But when you die, you
[37:30] keep on going through those shadows
[37:32] until you come to moisture. From
[37:34] moisture to a little trickling spring,
[37:36] from a spring to a creek, from a creek
[37:38] to a river, from a river to an ocean.
[37:40] See, of the love of God,
[37:43] you're just the same
[37:45] person. Look at here. Old Saul, the old
[37:48] backslider. He could not get through to
[37:51] God. Yet, he wasn't lost.
[37:54] He certainly wasn't. He was a prophet,
[37:56] but he just got outside of God. That's
[37:58] the reason brother I said you're not
[38:00] lost. So then remember you just got out
[38:03] of the will of God. So then the first
[38:05] thing you know you wouldn't agree. Now
[38:08] maybe I shouldn't have said
[38:10] that. All right I'm just going on for a
[38:12] happy congregation
[38:15] tonight. So
[38:17] then you know and the first thing you
[38:20] know oh my then he went to the the
[38:25] Yurundum. You know what the Yurma
[38:27] thundum was is a breastplate the f of at
[38:30] at the Aaron war and it was always God
[38:32] always has been a supernatural God
[38:34] answering in supernatural ways. And when
[38:37] a prophet prophesied and them mystic
[38:39] lights didn't come across that ur
[38:41] thunderum, he was wrong. When a dreamer
[38:44] told a dream and it didn't flash on that
[38:46] ur thundum, I don't care how good it
[38:48] sound, it was wrong. Amen. And it's
[38:50] right. And I don't care just exactly how
[38:53] many doctor's degrees you got and how
[38:55] big your organization is. When you
[38:57] prophesy, preach it ain't according to
[38:59] this word, you're wrong, brother. You're
[39:02] This is God's thunder.
[39:04] When you say you wasn't predestinated
[39:06] before the foundation of the world, she
[39:08] won't flash because the Bible said you
[39:10] was. Amen. When you say that you are to
[39:13] be baptized, name of father, son, holy
[39:26] ghost you all this
[39:29] morning. You're happy to be in the house
[39:32] of God.
[39:35] See if we can get this squared away
[39:57] here. Certainly good to have brother
[39:59] Daniel with with us.
[40:04] I knew he was coming. I just didn't know
[40:06] when. It's always good to see you,
[40:08] brother Daniel. See your smiling face.
[40:12] Praise the Lord. All right. Let's see if
[40:14] we can get this going.
[40:18] Okay. All
[40:21] right. I guess that's not going to
[40:25] work. Let's try this
[40:29] way. All right. Can you see
[40:33] that? Okay, let's just bow our heads
[40:36] this morning. Heavenly Father, we thank
[40:38] you, Lord, once again for the
[40:39] opportunity that you give us to be in
[40:41] the house of God, to worship you in
[40:43] spirit and in truth, Lord. Father,
[40:46] to look at some of these things, Father,
[40:48] that you've placed in your word. And we
[40:51] ask, Lord, that you would just uh anoint
[40:53] our lips. Forgive us for our sins, Lord
[40:56] Jesus. And Lord, may you just have your
[40:58] way here this morning. Help us, Lord, to
[41:00] receive something from you. We ask these
[41:02] things now in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[41:05] Amen. I just want to talk this morning a
[41:07] little bit about Christ's
[41:09] preeminence. Um I want to title it a
[41:12] prisoner to Christ's
[41:14] preeminence. Amen. And um I've just been
[41:18] thinking a a lot about the preeminence
[41:20] of God and um about how we should be how
[41:25] we should we as Christians is our uh
[41:29] duty to be to to give Christ amen our
[41:32] full preeminence in all of our lives.
[41:34] And so we're we'll we'll touch upon in
[41:36] just a moment about what what that means
[41:38] and um and we can just go from there. So
[41:43] um in Colossians 1 15-20 it says this
[41:47] who is who is the image of the invisible
[41:50] God the firstborn of every cre of every
[41:54] creature and this of course is talking
[41:56] about Jesus
[41:57] Christ. For by him were all things
[42:01] created that are in heaven and that are
[42:04] in earth visible and invisible whether
[42:07] they be thrones or dominions or
[42:09] principalities or powers. All things
[42:12] were created by him and for him. Amen.
[42:16] And he is before all things. In other
[42:21] words, he it it's it's hard to fathom
[42:23] that because we're always thinking in
[42:26] the mindset of something's born and then
[42:27] something dies. Something's born,
[42:30] something dies. Something born. And and
[42:32] to think that something has always been
[42:35] there, eternal, never had a beginning,
[42:38] never had an end, that's that that
[42:40] almost rattles the mind. You can't
[42:43] fathom that. You can't think that far.
[42:45] But that is that is our limitations that
[42:48] God placed us so we can give him the
[42:51] preeminence in our lives. Amen. Because
[42:54] he we can't think that far, but he can.
[42:57] Amen. Praise God.
[43:00] And he is before all things and by all
[43:03] things
[43:05] uh and by him all things consist. And he
[43:09] is the head of the body of the church
[43:13] who is the beginning, the firstborn from
[43:15] the dead, that in all things he might
[43:18] have the preeminence. And this is what
[43:20] it says in the in the New Living uh
[43:23] translation. I like the way it says it
[43:25] there. It says Christ is also the head
[43:28] of the church which is his body. He is
[43:32] the beginning supreme overall who rise
[43:35] from the dead. So he is first in
[43:39] everything. Right? And I want I just
[43:42] want you to to think about that and I
[43:44] want you to ask yourself is he first in
[43:47] everything in your life? Is he first in
[43:51] because he's first in everything, right?
[43:53] But is he first in everything in your
[43:56] life? Because if he's the head of the
[43:59] body and if the body is connected to the
[44:02] head, wherever the head moves, that's
[44:05] where the body should go to, right? My
[44:08] head doesn't move this way and my body
[44:10] stays right over here. My body tends to
[44:13] want to move where my head goes.
[44:15] Right? So that's exactly where what
[44:19] where wherever he goes, I will follow.
[44:21] Amen. Praise the Lord. For it pleased
[44:24] the Father that in him should all
[44:27] fullness dwell. And having made peace
[44:30] through the blood of his cross by him to
[44:33] reconcile all things unto himself, by
[44:35] him I say, whether they be things in
[44:38] earth or things in
[44:40] heaven. So that's the that's the end of
[44:42] the scripture there. Now, this is what
[44:44] the word preeminence means. And I
[44:46] apologize for the slides not being in
[44:49] nice order. You know, brother Bob does
[44:52] it in such a better way. But
[44:54] uh um preeminence refers to the state of
[44:59] being superior to or having precedence
[45:02] over others, holding the highest rank or
[45:05] importance or priority in a particular
[45:08] context. It describes something or
[45:10] someone that stands above all others in
[45:13] authority, significance or influence.
[45:16] And so these are some of the aspects of
[45:19] what preeminence includes. Superiority,
[45:22] having qualities, abilities or
[45:24] characteristics that exceed those of
[45:26] others in the same category. Think think
[45:28] for example uh uh your boss at work. He
[45:32] has the
[45:33] preeminence over certain aspects of of
[45:36] of your of your uh position there,
[45:40] right? You go to him for certain aspects
[45:44] now and then he might have a boss un
[45:46] over him and that boss has the
[45:48] preeminence over him and over you as
[45:51] well. Right? So um that's what that's
[45:55] what preeminence means. Amen.
[45:57] um being given first place or highest
[46:00] consideration in decisions, attention or
[46:04] resources. Amen. I believe Jesus Christ,
[46:06] he deserves first place. Amen. He he and
[46:11] we'll look at it here in just a moment,
[46:12] but he he gave it all. He gave the
[46:16] father the preeminence in his life,
[46:18] right? He said, "I can do nothing unless
[46:20] the father shows me first. I I'm not
[46:24] going to do anything. I'm not going to
[46:25] step into my own opinions. I'm not going
[46:27] to do I might have I might think of
[46:29] something in a certain way, but Amen. I
[46:32] I'm I'm bound by the word. Right? And if
[46:35] it's not in the word, Amen. I'm not
[46:37] going to move. I'm not going to proceed.
[46:39] And so and so if the head could have
[46:42] done that, him being the head, how much
[46:45] more the body, Amen, should do the exact
[46:48] same thing because the body is connected
[46:50] to the head. Right. Amen. Praise the
[46:52] Lord. Amen. And he's the what would what
[46:55] did we what did we just read? He is the
[46:57] creator of heavens and earth.
[46:58] Everything. Amen. Oh. Oh, that's just
[47:01] God. Amen. But he is God, right? And God
[47:04] condescended down. Amen. Into your form.
[47:08] He gave up all the the the the glory of
[47:10] heaven. He gave up at the splendor of
[47:12] heaven. Everything that that he didn't
[47:14] have to do it, but he did. Amen.
[47:18] And he gave up himself. He could have
[47:20] had a wife. He could have had a
[47:22] children. He could have he could have
[47:24] enjoyed a good job or you know like you
[47:27] and I could but he gave all the
[47:29] preeminence to the word or to the
[47:32] father. Praise the
[47:34] Lord. Authority uh this is another thing
[47:38] with the word uh another uh definition
[47:41] of the word uh preeminence. Authority,
[47:43] possessing recognized power or influence
[47:46] that others defer to. Distinction being
[47:49] clearly set apart from others due to
[47:52] excellence or importance. Amen. And I
[47:55] believe I believe that Jesus Christ
[47:58] gives that distinction, amen, to to his
[48:01] his fellow believers. Amen. That's the
[48:03] reason why um we we as Christians, Amen,
[48:07] we we we act differently, we dress
[48:10] differently, we we we we talk
[48:13] differently, amen, we we we live
[48:15] differently,
[48:16] right? Because there has to be a
[48:18] distinction. There has to be a
[48:21] preeminence, amen, to to uh to to God.
[48:24] Amen. In everything that in everything
[48:26] that we do, he's the primacy holding
[48:29] first place or the leading position in a
[48:33] hierarchy or order. Amen.
[48:36] So we know that these are the qualities
[48:39] of Jesus Christ. Amen. Everything that
[48:42] we just read, he fulfilled in the word
[48:46] of God. Amen. He fulfilled in his life
[48:48] when he came here as uh as an and
[48:52] experienced human flesh. Amen. human
[48:54] beings just like you and I. Amen. And
[48:56] that's the reason why he can say that he
[48:58] can be touched by the feeling of our
[49:01] infirmities. Now, we always think of the
[49:03] word infirmity as some as a sickness,
[49:06] but it's not necessarily just a
[49:08] sickness. Amen. He can be touched by the
[49:10] feeling of your
[49:12] frailty of of how weak you are of how of
[49:16] of the things that you go through go
[49:18] through the thoughts that run across
[49:20] your mind. Amen. when when at different
[49:23] moments of the day. Amen. When you're
[49:24] supposed to be going down to pray and
[49:27] and and then you start thinking about
[49:28] the laundry,
[49:31] just didn't think about it any other
[49:32] time, but just when you pray, right?
[49:35] Then think about, you know, that that
[49:37] part that you got to buy a AutoZone for
[49:39] the car and at any moment. Amen. But at
[49:43] that right at that moment, you see,
[49:45] Jesus probably had to battle had mind
[49:48] battles as well, right? We know that he
[49:51] did because he didn't want to go and
[49:53] die. Amen. As a human, he didn't want
[49:56] to. Amen. But he said, "Father, not my
[49:58] will, but but thy will be done." Why?
[50:01] Because you take the preeminence, Lord.
[50:04] I want you to have the
[50:05] preeminence. Amen. So, he gave up all
[50:09] the splendor of glory to in order to
[50:11] have that human experience with you and
[50:13] me. Amen. That's why he can be the head.
[50:17] That's why he is the head because the
[50:19] head my head is connected to my body.
[50:23] It's it's a human head, not a horse
[50:25] head.
[50:27] It's not a It's not It's not a an
[50:29] animal's head. Amen. To on a human body.
[50:31] Amen. It's the same quality, the same
[50:34] thing. Right. It's a human brain. I hope
[50:37] so. I think my wife would think that.
[50:43] So in Colossians 1 uh we just read 15-20
[50:47] he obtained all these aspects of
[50:49] preeminence by growing into them. All
[50:53] right. I want you to understand that
[50:55] Jesus Christ though he he was all God
[50:59] and though but yet he was all human.
[51:02] Amen. And the Bible says in Luke that he
[51:05] had to grow in in wisdom and in maturity
[51:09] as well.
[51:11] So he didn't know all things when he
[51:13] came here on earth. That's right. All
[51:16] right.
[51:18] Amen. In Revelations he said it says
[51:20] that that that the the re in Revelation
[51:22] one the revelation of Jesus Christ which
[51:24] God gave to him. That's right. He didn't
[51:27] know it at one point. The human B. I'm
[51:30] I'm speaking about the human aspect of
[51:32] of Jesus. He didn't know all things. He
[51:35] had to come and grow and learn. And I
[51:37] know that sounds kind of strange, but
[51:39] maybe we can just let the prophet tell
[51:40] you about it because look what Hebrews
[51:43] 7, I know this is kind of small, but I
[51:46] really apologize. I blow it up here a
[51:49] little bit. says, "Who in the days of
[51:51] his flesh, when he had offered up
[51:53] prayers and supplications with strong
[51:56] crying and tears unto him that was able
[51:58] to save him from death, and was heard in
[52:01] that he feared. Though he were a son,
[52:04] yet he
[52:06] learned he obedience, yet learned he
[52:09] obedience by the things what?"
[52:13] Oh, it doesn't say all the blessings
[52:14] that he received.
[52:17] every good day that he had,
[52:20] uh, you know, every good restaurant he
[52:23] was able to to eat at and, uh, money
[52:26] rolling in in the bank. And, uh,
[52:29] no, he said, though he were a son, he
[52:32] was a son, yet he learned obedience by
[52:35] the things which he
[52:37] suffered. Amen. And being made perfect,
[52:41] he became the author of eternal
[52:43] salvation unto all them that obey
[52:47] him. Amen. That's you and I. Called of
[52:51] God and high priest after the order of
[52:55] Melchazdc. Amen. Praise the Lord
[52:59] Jesus. So Jesus, he limited himself to
[53:03] the human
[53:05] experience. Though he were God, though
[53:08] he was God.
[53:10] Amen. As God, Jesus did not need to
[53:13] learn anything, especially obedience.
[53:16] Yet at his incarnation, Jesus limited
[53:18] himself to the human experience. I like
[53:21] this. He chose the weak position of
[53:23] having to learn and grow. Amen. And we
[53:27] read that in Luke
[53:29] 2:52. Amen. Just like you and I. Why?
[53:33] because he's the head,
[53:36] right? And the head experiences what the
[53:40] body experiences. Amen. The body
[53:44] experiences what the head experiences,
[53:46] right? Every every every pain that you
[53:50] that your body goes through,
[53:53] right? Your head or your brain is given
[53:56] signals for that. Right. Right. There's
[54:00] a connection there and that's why that
[54:02] there cannot be a disconnect between the
[54:04] body of Christ and the head of Christ.
[54:06] Right? Because he is the
[54:09] head. So Jesus did not know all things.
[54:14] Amen. He grew in knowledge and
[54:19] wisdom. I said, "Wow, he did not know
[54:22] all things." No, he did not know all
[54:24] things. as as as human as as in his
[54:27] human experience he did not know all
[54:30] things that's why he said I can do
[54:33] nothing unless the my father shows me
[54:36] first
[54:38] that that that's what differentiates him
[54:41] in the aspect of him being human but yet
[54:43] being God at the same time we knew the
[54:46] we know the fullness of God dwelleth in
[54:48] him right
[54:51] he was he was all God and he and in in
[54:54] Isaiah prophesied that it was going to
[54:55] be God with us. Amen. Because there was
[54:58] no one else that could save us but the
[55:00] blood of God. Amen. That's right. I'm
[55:02] saved by the blood of God. Amen. I'm not
[55:05] saved by just a prophet's blood. Amen.
[55:07] Or or or or some man's blood. Amen. We
[55:10] we are kept saved. Amen. By that blood.
[55:12] Praise the Lord Jesus.
[55:14] And it's got to be the blood of God.
[55:16] Amen. Or else Amen. We're still living
[55:18] in in our sins. If it's not God's blood,
[55:22] Amen. that came in. Amen. Praise the
[55:24] Lord. If it wasn't his uh uh his
[55:27] sacrifice, Amen. then we are still
[55:30] living in our sins. But I thank God that
[55:32] it's a finished work.
[55:35] Amen. The brother Brandham says in the
[55:38] revelation of Jesus Christ, he says the
[55:40] following. See if we can blow it up here
[55:42] just a little bit.
[55:47] He said, "Now I said, now I said that
[55:50] this book of revelation is the
[55:51] revelation of Jesus and what he is doing
[55:54] in the churches for those seven ages. It
[55:58] is a revelation because the disciples
[56:00] themselves didn't know these recorded
[56:03] truths." All right? It had not been
[56:06] previously revealed to them. You
[56:09] remember that they came to Jesus in the
[56:11] book of Acts and asked him, "Are you at
[56:14] this time going to restore the kingdom
[56:16] to Israel?" See, because the disciples,
[56:18] they were looking for a physical
[56:19] kingdom, right? Where Jesus didn't come
[56:22] to establish a physical
[56:25] kingdom. Jesus doesn't care about a
[56:27] physical kingdom
[56:29] because that's easy for him to obtain,
[56:32] right? He's he's more concerned about
[56:34] your kingdom
[56:36] because that's harder for that's a
[56:38] little tougher. It's not tough for him.
[56:40] It's just it it's tougher because we
[56:42] don't want to give him the preeminence.
[56:45] He the whole earth is his and they obey
[56:48] him at his command. The animals,
[56:51] mountains, the trees, everything.
[56:53] They're subject to him. We are the
[56:55] hardheads. That's right. And he's the
[56:58] one that he's the one. He's always
[57:02] having to deal with us, but yet that is
[57:04] the reason why his mercy and grace is
[57:06] never I'm so glad his mercy and grace
[57:09] always abounds. Praise the Lord. We are
[57:13] hard-headed. We don't learn. We don't we
[57:15] we want to do it our way. And we're
[57:18] always seeking something
[57:21] physical. You know, that's why it's so
[57:24] important. Amen. And in the hour that
[57:25] we're living in, do not get caught up
[57:28] with physical kingdoms.
[57:30] These kingdoms of the earth will pass
[57:32] away. Amen. Heaven and earth will pass
[57:35] away, but my my word, Amen, which is
[57:39] God, will not pass away.
[57:42] And he said, "It is not for you." This
[57:45] is what Jesus said, "It is not for you
[57:47] to know the times or the seasons." Those
[57:50] men were still thinking of Jesus having
[57:52] an earthly kingdom, but it was a
[57:54] spiritual kingdom that he was going to
[57:57] build. This is brother Brandham still
[58:00] speaking. He said even he what it says
[58:04] even he could not tell them about his
[58:07] place in it for the father had not
[58:10] revealed it unto him.
[58:12] Right? So Jesus didn't know until the
[58:16] father revealed it to him to to him
[58:18] first. Now when he died and resurrected,
[58:21] Amen. And he said all heaven and earth,
[58:23] all everything in heaven and earth,
[58:26] amen, is is uh belongs to me. Amen. He
[58:29] knew all things.
[58:31] Praise the Lord. But he had to conquer
[58:34] first.
[58:36] Amen. He had to do his
[58:38] duty. Praise the
[58:40] Lord. He says he's his place in it for
[58:43] the father had not revealed it unto him.
[58:45] But now after his death and resurrection
[58:48] and at this particular time in his
[58:51] mediatorial ministry, he is able to set
[58:54] forth here in this revelation of himself
[58:57] to John what his glory and presence in
[58:59] the church would mean and do. Amen. Let
[59:02] me go a
[59:04] little.
[59:06] Amen. The father was what took
[59:09] preeminence in Jesus' life. Amen. He
[59:11] says, "I can do nothing on my own." In
[59:13] John 5:30, as I hear, I judge, and my
[59:16] judgment is just because I seek not my
[59:18] own will, but the will of him who sent
[59:20] me. Let's just skip a few of these here
[59:23] for the sake of
[59:24] time. Amen. So, if the head had to give
[59:28] the preeminence to the to the
[59:30] intelligence, Amen. So does the body,
[59:33] right? Amen. We know Jesus is the head.
[59:37] But as him him being here on earth,
[59:40] Amen. He had to give preeminence to the
[59:42] intelligence which was the father,
[59:44] right? Which was the brain, right?
[59:46] Because I I have a head, right? But we
[59:49] have a brain that controls the head,
[59:52] right? So it wasn't just about the head.
[59:56] Amen. But it was about the intelligence
[59:58] working through the head and that
[1:00:00] intelligence. Amen. That int uh that
[1:00:02] head, Amen, connected to the body. So
[1:00:05] it's all one unit, right? Praise the
[1:00:07] Lord Jesus. Colossians 1:18 says, "And
[1:00:10] he is the head of the body, the church
[1:00:13] who is the beginning, the firstborn from
[1:00:14] the dead, that in all things he might
[1:00:17] have the preeminence." Amen. He wants
[1:00:18] the preeminence in all things in your
[1:00:20] life.
[1:00:22] Amen. He He has the preeminence in all
[1:00:25] things, right? We know that he's the God
[1:00:27] of heaven and earth. Amen. But does he
[1:00:29] have the preeminence in your life? Have
[1:00:32] you given him all the preeminence?
[1:00:35] Maybe there's some doors, amen, that you
[1:00:37] still haven't opened up to him yet,
[1:00:40] right?
[1:00:41] He wants everything. Not because he
[1:00:44] wants to uh enslave you or because he
[1:00:47] wants Amen. He just He wants Amen. so
[1:00:50] that you don't be enslaved by nothing
[1:00:52] else. Right. And when he has full
[1:00:54] control that there's nothing else that
[1:00:56] can enslave you. Amen. Praise God. Amen.
[1:01:00] This is this is in just a moment we'll
[1:01:02] look here at
[1:01:03] Paul. Amen. So while Jesus was in flesh
[1:01:07] on earth the intelligence the brain uh
[1:01:10] the father took the
[1:01:12] preeminence Jesus the head submitted
[1:01:15] submitted himself to the intelligence
[1:01:17] and the body which is us the church the
[1:01:19] bride submits to the head intelligence.
[1:01:22] Right? I have this little diagram here.
[1:01:25] This is the
[1:01:27] body. Amen. the father, the
[1:01:29] intelligence, the brain while Jesus was
[1:01:31] here on earth. Amen. He him being the
[1:01:36] head but could not come to being the
[1:01:39] head until he first did his mediatorial
[1:01:42] work, right? As dying and resurrecting
[1:01:45] and paying for our sins. Amen. That's
[1:01:48] when he he he became he said, "I go I
[1:01:52] came from the father and I go back to
[1:01:53] the father." Right. Right. It was the
[1:01:56] father the whole time. Right.
[1:01:58] Praise the Lord Jesus. And then the
[1:02:00] church, the body, the church bride
[1:02:03] submits to the head or the intelligence,
[1:02:07] right? Kind of interesting that that
[1:02:09] that that it's where the neck is, right?
[1:02:13] From the neck down, that's that's that's
[1:02:15] that's the bride. That's the
[1:02:18] church,
[1:02:20] right? You know, sometimes they they say
[1:02:24] a a man says, "I'm the head of the
[1:02:25] house." And then the woman says, "But
[1:02:28] I'm the neck that moves the
[1:02:32] head, so you can't do without either
[1:02:34] one."
[1:02:38] All right.
[1:02:41] And and us brothers
[1:02:44] say, "Nobody said it."
[1:02:48] That's right.
[1:02:49] You know better.
[1:02:52] All right. Let's let's look at this here
[1:02:54] for just a moment. Paul, a prisoner of
[1:02:56] Jesus Christ. Now Paul in Ephesians 3:1,
[1:03:00] "For this reason I, Paul, a prisoner of
[1:03:03] Christ Jesus on behalf of you Gentiles,"
[1:03:07] he says
[1:03:08] this in Ephesians 4:1, he says, "I
[1:03:10] therefore, a prisoner for the Lord, urge
[1:03:12] you to walk in a manner worthy of the
[1:03:15] calling to which you have been called."
[1:03:17] You know, in some places he called
[1:03:18] himself an apostle. In some places he
[1:03:21] called the servant of Jesus Christ. He
[1:03:23] called himself. But in in in other
[1:03:25] places he called himself I therefore the
[1:03:28] prisoner. Now a prisoner Amen. He's he
[1:03:31] has given himself h wholly to the
[1:03:34] system. Right.
[1:03:37] He he he has no a prisoner when you
[1:03:39] think of a prison a prisoner he has he
[1:03:42] has no rights of his own. Right. Right.
[1:03:46] He has nothing of his own. He's
[1:03:48] completely stripped away of all his
[1:03:51] rights in order to only do what is given
[1:03:54] him to do what is told to him to do. In
[1:03:58] Phileiman 1:1, Paul a prisoner for
[1:04:00] Christ Jesus and Timothy our brother to
[1:04:01] Phileiman in Phileiman 1:9 yet for
[1:04:04] love's sake I prefer to appeal to you I
[1:04:06] Paul an old man and now a prisoner also
[1:04:09] for Christ Jesus now we know that Paul
[1:04:13] he called himself that prisoner of
[1:04:15] Christ
[1:04:16] um and this was both real and spiritual
[1:04:19] for Paul we know that he he he was he
[1:04:22] was in prisons all the time but what was
[1:04:26] causing him to go to prison Amen. Was
[1:04:28] for the love of Christ for the He had
[1:04:30] given God the preeminence already. And
[1:04:33] let me tell you, when you give God the
[1:04:35] preeminence, Amen. the you're going to
[1:04:38] you're going to uh uh you're going to
[1:04:41] have trials. You're going to be
[1:04:42] persecuted. Not everyone's going to like
[1:04:44] you.
[1:04:46] Right. And certainly the devil is going
[1:04:49] to be behind is going to be after you.
[1:04:51] And this was the case with Paul. And and
[1:04:53] and there's a theme in the Bible. Amen.
[1:04:56] that that that before you people gave
[1:04:58] themselves gave the preeminence to God,
[1:05:02] they had to be knocked off their high
[1:05:04] horse first.
[1:05:06] Just like Paul did. Paul was full too
[1:05:08] much of
[1:05:10] himself. He had to be stripped away.
[1:05:13] Same thing with Joseph. Same thing with
[1:05:15] Moses. And brother Brandham talks about
[1:05:17] this in that message, a prisoner.
[1:05:20] They had to be they had to be stripped
[1:05:22] away of everything that they were in
[1:05:25] order to fully give God the preeminence.
[1:05:28] Amen.
[1:05:30] Praise the Lord.
[1:05:32] He was literally Paul was literally in
[1:05:34] Roman prisons all the time.
[1:05:37] And and this is kind
[1:05:40] of something the way the the way Paul
[1:05:43] describes in some verses of the way he
[1:05:45] was in he was under house arrest. And
[1:05:48] the way house arrest would work is is
[1:05:51] they would have to the prisoner
[1:05:54] especially if they were citizens of
[1:05:55] Rome. They were given a little better
[1:05:58] better treatment.
[1:06:00] But the way that it would work is that
[1:06:02] they would have to rent their own place
[1:06:04] to be to be a prisoner in.
[1:06:08] They were not given a place by Rome.
[1:06:10] They were they would they'd had to
[1:06:11] choose a place or uh and I'm sure there
[1:06:14] was some stipulations there. But at the
[1:06:17] same time, Paul always had to have a
[1:06:21] Roman guard tied to him all the time.
[1:06:26] So his left hand or his right hand was
[1:06:29] always chained up to a to a Roman
[1:06:32] soldier for eight hour eight hour
[1:06:34] shifts, four to eight hour
[1:06:36] shifts. And that's why Paul talks about
[1:06:39] I'm a prisoner of Christ because he took
[1:06:42] what he was going through and he
[1:06:44] spiritualized it. He he he made he he
[1:06:48] was going through something bad but yet
[1:06:50] he used it. Amen. For the glory of God.
[1:06:53] Because even though he was he was he was
[1:06:56] in prison or even though he was in tied
[1:06:59] up to a Roman soldier constantly
[1:07:00] watching him all the time, he could
[1:07:02] still write letters. He could still have
[1:07:05] visitors. He could still so he he was
[1:07:07] able to still testify. That's why he
[1:07:09] wrote all these letters of these books
[1:07:11] that we that we write that we read. He
[1:07:14] wrote Phileiman and all these different
[1:07:16] books. And so the Roman soldier,
[1:07:18] everything that Paul did, everything
[1:07:20] that Paul spoke, everything that the
[1:07:22] Roman soldier was there listening the
[1:07:24] whole time.
[1:07:26] Every soldier and and then in one
[1:07:28] scripture he says uh I greet you uh the
[1:07:32] um I'm just kind of paraphrasing. He
[1:07:34] says the the house of Cornelius or the
[1:07:37] house of of of Caesar sends greetings to
[1:07:39] you as well. In other words, they were
[1:07:41] talking amongst themselves about what
[1:07:43] Paul believed about his writings and
[1:07:46] about everything. So, you might be in a
[1:07:49] bad condition. You might be you might
[1:07:51] feel like like you're you're you're in a
[1:07:54] a spiritual uh uh you know, a tri a
[1:07:57] trial. Amen. But but look at the bright
[1:08:01] side. Look look what is it that God is
[1:08:03] doing. Amen. It might be your Roman your
[1:08:06] Roman soldier tied to you right there.
[1:08:08] Amen. But that Amen. He he we don't know
[1:08:11] what God is doing. God probably tied
[1:08:13] certain Roman soldiers to to Paul so
[1:08:16] that they could get converted.
[1:08:18] Right.
[1:08:20] And so that Roman soldier where wherever
[1:08:24] Paul didn't have any privacy at all and
[1:08:26] he knew that therefore he took advantage
[1:08:29] of the situation.
[1:08:32] Well, if I'm not going to have any
[1:08:33] privacy, I'm not going to do wherever I
[1:08:35] go, he goes. Wherever Whatever I read,
[1:08:38] he reads. whatever I write, he's he's
[1:08:40] looking at. Well, then I'm just going to
[1:08:42] just just be the best witness that I
[1:08:44] can. Amen. And that's what Paul did.
[1:08:47] Amen. I wonder if we can think about
[1:08:49] that. If we can give God the preeminence
[1:08:52] in that way, Lord, I may not have the
[1:08:54] control of everything in my life, but
[1:08:57] whatever I can do, I'm just going to
[1:08:59] make the best of it. Amen. Make the best
[1:09:03] of the situation of that that I'm in.
[1:09:06] And Lord, you take the preeminence in my
[1:09:08] life.
[1:09:11] Amen. Can can you imagine just being
[1:09:14] tied and look that Roman soldier just
[1:09:16] they're looking at at what Paul and I'm
[1:09:18] sure like how can this man write the
[1:09:20] things that he's
[1:09:22] writing? How can this man talk the way
[1:09:25] he's talking and yet be under
[1:09:28] under prison under chains?
[1:09:32] He said he said that's why he said in
[1:09:34] some places uh don't be ashamed of my
[1:09:37] chains
[1:09:38] because he was proud of his chains.
[1:09:41] Amen. Sometimes we get caught up in
[1:09:44] chains of circumstances in this life and
[1:09:46] we want people to feel bad for our
[1:09:48] chains but you were the one who got
[1:09:50] yourself into that. Amen. And then you
[1:09:53] want somebody to get you out.
[1:09:56] Amen.

[1:29:34] but he had his usual brain scan. First
[1:29:36] time in 5 years was clean. Doctor
[1:29:38] replied, "What a miracle." May this be
[1:29:40] the first of many scans that I will have
[1:29:41] that we have a living supernatural God.
[1:29:44] They gave me four months when we
[1:29:45] started. Now 5 years later, I have a
[1:29:48] clear brain scan.
[1:29:56] That is a real God. Sister Rebecca,

[1:30:08] continue to remember her in your
[1:30:09] prayer. Uh but Sister Monica turned in a
[1:30:12] real lengthy request. This is you can

[1:32:11] future and life is worth the living just
[1:32:18] because
[1:32:20] He
[1:32:22] lives. God sent his
[1:32:28] son and they called him
[1:32:34] Jesus. He came to
[1:32:41] love and

[1:33:16] I can face
[1:33:21] tomorrow
[1:33:23] because he

[1:33:42] [Music]
[1:33:45] future and life is worth the living just

[1:36:03] My life is worth the living just because

[1:36:17] assurance. I was listening to a sermon
[1:36:20] the other day and I can't remember who
[1:36:22] was saying it. The very one thing
[1:36:25] Christianity hinges on is that
[1:36:27] resurrection. There's no resurrection,
[1:36:30] there's no life. And what a blessed
[1:36:32] assurance. It takes away the fear. It
[1:36:34] takes away all of our problems to know
[1:36:36] that he lives. And if you haven't met it
[1:36:38] this morning, he's here. He's here to
[1:36:41] let you know that he is alive. We don't
[1:36:44] have to be afraid of death. We got a a
[1:36:46] baby dedication this morning. And and we
[1:36:49] rejoice and and but there's also this
[1:36:52] thing we call death that comes into
[1:36:54] life. But I tell you, you meet the
[1:36:56] resurrection and life. and you die to
[1:36:58] yourself, like brother Luis was saying,
[1:37:00] you you give him that preeminence,
[1:37:02] there's no more fear. There's only peace
[1:37:04] and you're living in his will. Amen. Are
[1:37:07] you thankful for that? Hallelujah. Um,
[1:37:10] brother Kern, would you come this
[1:37:11] morning and lift up the tithes and
[1:37:13] offering for
[1:37:14] us? Amen.
[1:37:19] Heavenly Father, we are thankful Lord
[1:37:20] God that you have placed that burden on
[1:37:22] our hearts Lord to bring us into your
[1:37:25] house Lord to worship from you Lord
[1:37:27] Father. We thankful Lord God that we
[1:37:30] serve a God that is true to his will
[1:37:32] Lord and your will is to adopt sons and
[1:37:35] daughters unto you Lord Father. So in
[1:37:37] doing so we pray that you'll bless
[1:37:39] brother Wade as he comes use him in a
[1:37:41] special way. help the country of the
[1:37:46] [Music]
[1:38:02] people.
[1:38:06] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:38:10] Oh, some glad morning. When this life is
[1:38:15] over,
[1:38:17] I'll fly
[1:38:21] away. Oh, a home on God's celestial
[1:38:26] shores.
[1:38:28] I'll fly
[1:38:30] [Music]
[1:38:31] away. Oh,
[1:38:34] I'll fly away. Oh,
[1:38:38] [Music]
[1:38:40] glory away in the
[1:38:43] morning. I can die. Hallelujah. By and
[1:38:48] by,
[1:38:50] I fly
[1:38:54] away. And when the shadows of this life
[1:38:59] has grown,
[1:39:02] now fly away.
[1:39:06] Like a bird from prison bars have flown.
[1:39:12] Oh,
[1:39:13] I fly away. Let's all stand. Oh,
[1:39:18] I fly away. Oh,
[1:39:24] glory. Fly away in the
[1:39:28] morning. I could die. Hallelujah. By and
[1:39:33] by. Go
[1:39:35] out, fly
[1:39:38] away, and just a few more weary days.
[1:39:44] And then

[1:41:10] Amen.
[1:41:13] Praise God again that we can come
[1:41:15] together to worship.
[1:41:18] I want to just give a little short
[1:41:20] testimony. Won't take but a minute.
[1:41:25] Friday night, I I started off to the
[1:41:28] store and when I got to where I was
[1:41:30] going, the traffic was so heavy I
[1:41:32] couldn't get around good. So, I decided
[1:41:35] to take a side road. When I
[1:41:38] did make the turn to turn around, I hit
[1:41:41] a curb and bust the tie. Uhoh.
[1:41:45] And soon as I got back to a safe place,
[1:41:50] I stopped. A guy came by and said, "Uh,
[1:41:53] need some help?" Said, "Yeah." So, he
[1:41:57] got out and changed his tie for me.
[1:42:00] Took the Amen. tie off and put the spare
[1:42:05] on. And then he said, "You you look like
[1:42:08] you're about 14." I said, "Well, thank
[1:42:11] you."
[1:42:13] Anyway, and he said,
[1:42:15] "Uh" and I told him the next said, "The
[1:42:18] next day, my birthday, we were talking."
[1:42:20] and he said, "Uh, we're here. Take this
[1:42:23] $10 for your
[1:42:25] birthday." So, just thank the Lord
[1:42:29] somebody for so gracious. Amen. Amen.
[1:42:32] Amen. Remember me in prayer. Amen. We're
[1:42:36] going
[1:42:37] to read this morning from Psalm 105
[1:42:42] verses
[1:42:44] 1-14. Let us pray.
[1:42:48] Heavenly Father, we're ever grateful and
[1:42:50] thankful unto you, Lord, for all that
[1:42:52] you do. God, you have brought us this
[1:42:55] far, Lord. And we're going to follow on
[1:42:58] after you, hold on to your unchanging
[1:43:00] hand. Lord, you love us. And we know
[1:43:02] that you have given us many things,
[1:43:05] Lord, that we didn't deserve, but
[1:43:07] Father, because your love unto us, we
[1:43:10] ask you this morning to come into the
[1:43:12] congregation, Lord. Touch every heart,
[1:43:14] Father. Stir it that it may see your
[1:43:18] blessing power moving among us. God, we
[1:43:20] know that this is in late late hour that
[1:43:23] Satan is raging, but God, you are still
[1:43:26] loving us. And we thank you in Jesus
[1:43:28] name we pray.
[1:43:34] Amen. Psalm
[1:43:37] 105 verses
[1:43:40] 1-14. Oh, give thanks unto the Lord.
[1:43:43] Call upon his name. Make known his deeds
[1:43:46] among the people.
[1:43:49] Sing unto him. Sing songs unto him. Talk
[1:43:53] ye of all his wondous works.
[1:43:56] Glory ye in his holy name. Let the heart
[1:44:00] of them rejoice that seek the Lord.
[1:44:03] Seek the Lord and his strength. Seek his
[1:44:06] face ever more. Remember his marvelous
[1:44:10] works that he has done. His wonders and
[1:44:14] judgments are his mouth.
[1:44:17] Oh ye seed of Abraham his servant, ye
[1:44:21] children of Jacob his chosen.
[1:44:24] He is the Lord our God. His judgments
[1:44:28] are in all the earth.
[1:44:31] Heath remembered his covenant forever.
[1:44:34] the word which he commanded to a
[1:44:36] thousand generations,
[1:44:39] which covenant he made with Abraham, and
[1:44:42] his oath unto Isaac,
[1:44:45] and confirmed the same unto Jacob for a
[1:44:48] law, and to Israel for an everlasting
[1:44:51] covenant, saying, Unto thee will I give
[1:44:55] the land of Canaan, the lot of your
[1:45:01] inheritance. in number, yay, very few,
[1:45:05] and strangers in when they went from one
[1:45:10] nation to another, from one kingdom to
[1:45:13] another people,
[1:45:15] he suffered no man to do them wrong.
[1:45:19] Yay, he brings for
[1:45:24] Amen. God bless you. May be seated.
[1:45:41] Amen. We appreciate that testimony,
[1:45:44] brother Collie. I tell you, um, Lord,
[1:45:46] he's a present help in the time of need.
[1:45:49] Reminded me of the good Samaritan
[1:45:51] testimony and or the story in the Bible.
[1:45:54] And um cuz you remember this uh the good
[1:45:57] Samaritan, he helped the person in the
[1:45:59] time of need. Then he paid uh gave some
[1:46:01] money to help and continue to help. So
[1:46:04] God has people all around us. You just
[1:46:06] look to him. He knows when you need help
[1:46:09] and can protect you and bring um who he
[1:46:13] needs on the scene uh for that. So let's
[1:46:17] um let's sing that song. The more I
[1:46:21] surrender. Amen. You know, I don't know
[1:46:24] if it's just the way the Lord is lead
[1:46:27] leading this morning, but um the way uh
[1:46:30] brother Louise again, he's just talking
[1:46:32] about preeminence. And um I don't know
[1:46:35] if anyone noticed years ago, brother
[1:46:37] Dell, he he preached on God being
[1:46:40] preeminent in your life. And there was
[1:46:42] there's a quote that brother Brandham
[1:46:44] said, "In Christ, the mystery of God
[1:46:47] revealed that sermon." And it was such a
[1:46:50] um maybe it was just so impactful to the
[1:46:53] to the people at that time. We put it on
[1:46:56] the back of the wall back there. And uh
[1:46:58] maybe sometimes when when you have time
[1:47:00] just go read that. Um, it it really is
[1:47:03] what each believer's desire. Each
[1:47:06] Christian should want is what God is
[1:47:09] trying to pour into you himself, his
[1:47:13] will, his mind, his thoughts, his
[1:47:15] nature, his love, his
[1:47:17] desires. And uh the more we surrender,
[1:47:20] we don't have to fight it. A lot of
[1:47:22] times I'm guilty. We all fight it a lot
[1:47:24] of times. Um, but when it comes down to
[1:47:27] it, we just open our heart and say,
[1:47:28] "Lord, the more I surrender, the lighter
[1:47:31] my load." We're here for a moment, a
[1:47:34] vapor, but we're here to do his will.
[1:47:36] Amen. Hallelujah. Let's sing this
[1:47:44] together. Just let this be your prayer
[1:47:46] this morning.
[1:47:53] Oh, the more that I
[1:47:58] surrender, the
[1:48:01] lighter my Lord.
[1:48:05] The more that I release my cares, oh,
[1:48:11] the more you take
[1:48:15] control. The more that I can humble
[1:48:21] myself, the more you lift me
[1:48:25] up. And every day I
[1:48:30] live, Lord, I love you more. Oh, just
[1:48:35] sing it to him
[1:48:36] again. Oh, the more that I
[1:48:43] surrender, the
[1:48:46] lighter my
[1:48:49] Lord. The more that I release my
[1:48:54] cares, the more you take control.
[1:49:01] The more that I can humble
[1:49:05] myself, the more you lift me up. And
[1:49:11] every day I
[1:49:14] live. Lord, I love you more.
[1:49:19] [Music]
[1:49:22] And it gets
[1:49:24] easier to
[1:49:27] understand this road I'm traveling
[1:49:31] down. Oh, no more
[1:49:35] wavering and
[1:49:38] wondering. I'm standing on solid
[1:49:43] ground. And I know I'm headed to my
[1:49:48] future home. And the voice I hear is
[1:49:53] yours
[1:49:54] alone. Every day I
[1:49:57] live. Lord, I love. Oh, just tell him
[1:50:01] how much you love him this
[1:50:03] morning.
[1:50:05] Oh, the more that I
[1:50:10] surrender, the
[1:50:13] lighter my Lord.
[1:50:16] And the more that I release my cares,
[1:50:22] Lord, the more you take
[1:50:27] control. The more that I can humble
[1:50:32] myself, the more you lift me up. And
[1:50:38] every day I live.
[1:50:42] Lord, I love you
[1:50:44] [Music]
[1:50:48] more. And the problems I had on
[1:50:53] yesterday are a step in stone to a
[1:50:58] higher place. The trials that seem so
[1:51:03] awesome to me are now my better of
[1:51:09] victory. And I know I'm headed to a
[1:51:14] future home. And the voice I
[1:51:18] hear always is his alone. Every day I
[1:51:23] live. Lord, I love you more.
[1:51:31] Oh, the more that I
[1:51:36] surrender, the
[1:51:39] lighter, my
[1:51:42] Lord. The more that I release my cares,
[1:51:48] Lord, the more you take control.
[1:51:54] The more that I can humble
[1:51:58] myself, the more you lift me up. And
[1:52:03] every day I
[1:52:06] live. Lord, I love. Let's just all stand
[1:52:10] and worship him this morning.
[1:52:13] Oh, more than I thought, more than I
[1:52:19] surrender, the
[1:52:21] lighter my Lord.
[1:52:25] The more that I grease my cares, the
[1:52:31] more you take
[1:52:35] control, the more that
[1:52:38] I humble
[1:52:40] myself, the more you lift me up. And
[1:52:46] every day I
[1:52:48] live, Lord, I love you more.
[1:52:55] [Music]
[1:52:57] Holy
[1:52:59] words long
[1:53:01] reserve for our

[1:54:16] sacrifice. Oh, heed the faithful words
[1:54:20] of
[1:54:22] Christ. Holy
[1:54:24] words long
[1:54:27] preserved. Here our
[1:54:29] walk in this world and they
[1:54:34] resound with God's own heart. Oh, let
[1:54:38] the word of God. Sing it from your heart
[1:54:41] today.
[1:54:43] Word of God is ever true. It'll never
[1:54:47] fail you. It'll never lie.
[1:54:51] It will always help you. It's always
[1:54:54] positive.
[1:54:56] That's the only thing you can depend on
[1:54:58] in this world.

[1:55:02] more time. Oh, word of God. It's forever

[1:55:31] help you. The only time it doesn't help
[1:55:33] you is when you don't read
[1:55:34] it. Hello, somebody. when you don't read
[1:55:38] it. We can read everything else. As I uh
[1:55:41] we were talking u last Sunday, you can
[1:55:44] read all these self-help books you want
[1:55:46] to. This is the best self-help book
[1:55:48] there ever was. And it's eternal. It'll
[1:55:51] give you an eternal quality that them
[1:55:53] other things can. We like it's okay,
[1:55:55] Dave Ramsey and all the different ones.
[1:55:56] That's all right. That's okay. But not
[1:56:00] the eternal word of God. The eternal
[1:56:02] word of God will never fail you. It'll
[1:56:04] never leave you. nor will it forsake
[1:56:07] you. Good to be in the house of the
[1:56:08] Lord. Good to have everybody here. We
[1:56:10] know we're here for a couple of things.
[1:56:12] We're here for a dedication service.
[1:56:14] Also here for a baptism and then also
[1:56:17] for
[1:56:18] um something about a birthday. I don't
[1:56:21] know whose birthday that is,
[1:56:23] but I think it's my
[1:56:29] sweethearts. Keep it
[1:56:32] down. But yesterday we had a good time.
[1:56:35] Uh y'all go ahead and be seated. We're
[1:56:37] going to we're going to do this uh at
[1:56:40] first. But yesterday we had a good time.
[1:56:42] Uh for those of you that didn't come to
[1:56:44] the house, uh we had a good time of
[1:56:46] shooting and and instructions and um we
[1:56:49] found out that Levi and Jonas will be
[1:56:52] entering law
[1:56:54] enforcement and don't ever make them
[1:56:57] mad cuz they shoot the eyes out of that
[1:56:59] target. But the instructor was there and
[1:57:01] he actually helped a lot of people. So
[1:57:03] you can see the people develop into
[1:57:05] better shooters. And uh we're going to
[1:57:07] be doing it again uh Lord willing next
[1:57:11] Sunday afternoon. So at my house at 4:00
[1:57:14] next Sunday afternoon my house at 4:00
[1:57:18] and we'll uh we'll have um water and
[1:57:21] drinks and um you can eat grass or
[1:57:24] something and chew on chew on a stick.
[1:57:29] But we had a really good time and we
[1:57:30] appreciate the uh Mike coming and and
[1:57:33] helping us out. And some of you have
[1:57:35] some of you have expressed interest to
[1:57:37] continue the shooting part. So we'll do
[1:57:39] that next Sunday 4:00, Lord willing. And
[1:57:42] we did it yesterday because at 1:00 it's
[1:57:44] supposed to come thunderstorm. So we
[1:57:47] weren't going to be able to do that. But
[1:57:48] we sure do appreciate you. Thank you for
[1:57:51] uh being here with Brother David last
[1:57:52] Sunday. uh we were at the Methodist
[1:57:54] church and and uh spoke to them um for a
[1:57:58] little while and and had a good time in
[1:58:00] the Lord there. So, we appreciate the
[1:58:02] Lord being with us. Also, Brother Daniel
[1:58:06] Martinez will be speaking for us on
[1:58:07] Wednesday
[1:58:09] night. Always good to have brother
[1:58:11] Daniel here. Like every time he comes,
[1:58:15] but if he didn't leave, he wouldn't have
[1:58:17] to be
[1:58:18] anyway. Yeah.
[1:58:21] Next Sunday we'll have communion and
[1:58:23] footwashing. Should be today, but we got
[1:58:25] all this going on. We'll do it next
[1:58:27] Sunday. Um, good to see sister Tarcilla
[1:58:31] here with us today all the way from
[1:58:34] Kenya,
[1:58:37] Georgia, the country of Kenya. But good
[1:58:40] to have her with us and she gonna be
[1:58:41] with us for a little bit. That's sister
[1:58:43] uh Anna's mom and sister Rebecca's mom.
[1:58:47] So good to have them and always good to
[1:58:49] have Steve and and Amy with us and and I
[1:58:53] forget the young girl's name, but she
[1:58:55] knows who it
[1:58:57] is. Elbert Hubard said, "God will not
[1:59:00] look you over for medals, degrees, or
[1:59:03] diplomas, but for
[1:59:05] scars." But for
[1:59:08] scars. The great thing to remember is
[1:59:11] that though our feelings come and go,
[1:59:12] God's love does not come and go. It
[1:59:16] never waivers. Our faith waivers. Our
[1:59:18] love waivers. But God's love is eternal.
[1:59:21] And he can't change his mind. If he ever
[1:59:23] loved you before the foundation of the
[1:59:25] world, he still loves you. There's not a
[1:59:27] day in the world that God's not going to
[1:59:29] love you. There's days in the there's
[1:59:31] times that we think he's gone and left
[1:59:33] us, but it's just child training. It's
[1:59:36] just helping us to grow up and not be a
[1:59:38] spoiled child, not be a spoiled brat.
[1:59:41] So, as we get started today, we're going
[1:59:43] to speak actually on a dedication
[1:59:44] service. why we do it. A lot of times we
[1:59:47] have these these things and sometimes
[1:59:49] they become rituals, but they're not
[1:59:50] rituals. They're for a Christian to be a
[1:59:54] whole Christian. There's things we have
[1:59:56] to do that are different from the world.
[2:00:00] Okay? We believe in the Bible. We
[2:00:02] believe in scripture. We believe that
[2:00:04] Jesus Christ was the son of God. We
[2:00:06] believe that he is God, was God, and
[2:00:09] always will be God. And we believe also
[2:00:12] in baby dedications. We do not believe
[2:00:13] in ba baby baptism and I'll cover that
[2:00:16] today where the word of God tells us
[2:00:18] that in just a few minutes. So, if
[2:00:21] they'll come on up, we will uh we'll
[2:00:24] dedicate our little one.
[2:00:28] Um family, all the
[2:00:32] family, come on
[2:00:35] up and we will
[2:00:39] uh are you going to be able to pull that
[2:00:42] up on the screen with me plugged
[2:00:44] in? Just come on
[2:00:50] up. Yeah, I will. I
[2:00:55] will. All right. All right. So, this is
[2:00:57] the newest addition to the family
[2:01:00] and we sure do appreciate them.
[2:01:05] Let's go ahead and
[2:01:06] sing. Bring them in before we get
[2:01:09] started. Bring them
[2:01:12] in. Bring them
[2:01:15] in. Bring them in from the field of
[2:01:22] sin. Bring them in.
[2:01:26] Bring them
[2:01:29] in. Bring the little ones to

[2:01:47] then dad dedicating that was one of the
[2:01:49] last ones he dedicated

[2:02:55] Okay, it's
[2:02:58] okay. This
[2:03:00] is Emerson Dean Dale and we're going to
[2:03:05] dedicate her to the Lord and then um
[2:03:08] today we'll sit down and we will um go
[2:03:11] over why we do this and it's very
[2:03:13] important and I'll I'll speak some about
[2:03:16] it. But as brother Dale always said,
[2:03:19] this baby is is he's she's a
[2:03:23] Dale, but she's also a member of the
[2:03:25] church. So you, the church family,
[2:03:27] living in front of them as well, and
[2:03:31] that's your commission. We'll talk a
[2:03:33] little bit about that in just a little
[2:03:34] bit. So let's bow our
[2:03:36] heads. Let's give this little baby back
[2:03:39] to the
[2:03:42] Lord. To heavenly father, we stand
[2:03:44] today.
[2:03:46] Lord, with a child that's so innocent
[2:03:49] and
[2:03:50] pure, heart so
[2:03:52] right, has no evil
[2:03:55] thought, has no
[2:03:57] sin. Although she was born in sin, Lord,
[2:04:00] you made a way when you came and died at
[2:04:03] Calvary. You died for the little
[2:04:07] babies. And they don't have a chance
[2:04:09] maybe to to ask you to forgive them,
[2:04:12] Lord, until they get older. And father,
[2:04:15] I pray in the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:04:16] that you'll we dedicate this little
[2:04:19] Emerson Dean Dale back to you, Father.
[2:04:22] We're going to give them back to the
[2:04:23] family, but Lord, it's not going to end
[2:04:25] there. Lord, I pray that they'll raise
[2:04:28] her in the admonition of the Lord and
[2:04:31] that these things will be done for your
[2:04:32] honor and glory, Lord. In Jesus name we
[2:04:35] pray. Amen. God bless you.
[2:04:41] Bring them
[2:04:43] in. Bring them
[2:04:47] in. Bring them in from the field of
[2:04:53] sin. Bring them
[2:04:56] in. Bring them
[2:05:00] in. Bring the little ones to
[2:05:06] Jesus. Amen. Let's stand to our feet. We
[2:05:10] kind of be a little bit out of the norm
[2:05:12] today. I knew we'd have uh nobody's a
[2:05:15] visitor, but uh we would just kind of
[2:05:18] explain some things today. We we're
[2:05:21] going to explain a little bit to with uh
[2:05:23] again about water baptism because we're
[2:05:25] going to have a baptismal service.
[2:05:27] Brother Joseph's going to be baptized in
[2:05:29] the name of the Lord Jesus. But we'll
[2:05:31] talk today a little bit about why we do
[2:05:34] these things. We don't do them, you
[2:05:35] know, um nothing against Catholic doc,
[2:05:40] Catholic doctrine or anything else. It's
[2:05:42] just that when they come and bring a
[2:05:44] ritual, that just becomes a ritual and
[2:05:46] you just you just do the you know, you
[2:05:48] just do the thing. I
[2:05:51] u I don't like
[2:05:53] programs. Um there is a method of
[2:05:57] worship, but it should be the leading of
[2:05:59] the Lord, not the leading of a piece of
[2:06:02] paper. And I know we do have to have
[2:06:04] structure here. We do have to have
[2:06:06] certain songs that we need to sing and
[2:06:08] all these things. But if the spirit of
[2:06:10] the Lord has our me has our uh song
[2:06:13] leaders to go in a different direction,
[2:06:16] then remember he's perfect. We're not.
[2:06:19] So if he comes on the scene and changes
[2:06:21] something, even a sermon, praise God for
[2:06:24] that. That means he's among us. He's
[2:06:26] doing the work and somebody needs it.
[2:06:29] All right. So let's go to Matthew
[2:06:33] 19:E13 and let's start there. All minds
[2:06:37] clear. Just remember the announcements.
[2:06:40] Um then we'll have a baptismal service
[2:06:44] immediately following this service.
[2:06:46] We'll go down to the baptismal pool and
[2:06:49] then we'll have a um a birthday uh
[2:06:52] celebration for Jim. She's her
[2:06:54] birthday's on the 10th. You heard Ryan
[2:06:55] say that, but we're going to do it
[2:06:56] today. And uh then next Sunday we'll
[2:07:00] have foot wash and communion and then
[2:07:02] we'll shoot my house up. As Ryan
[2:07:06] said, they kept they kept shooting
[2:07:08] yesterday and they kept banging it off
[2:07:11] of the
[2:07:12] um the wires where the not where the
[2:07:14] cows are, but you know, barb wire.
[2:07:17] Finally, they they broke it in half. So
[2:07:19] that's good. You got to destroy
[2:07:21] something when you start shooting. I
[2:07:22] mean, it's just just the way it is. So,
[2:07:25] but you're all invited if uh next Sunday
[2:07:28] uh just remember if you've already done
[2:07:30] it, then probably you won't get to
[2:07:31] shoot, but you can stand in the
[2:07:33] background and we can just have some
[2:07:34] good fellowship. So, Matthew 19:13,
[2:07:37] let's bow our heads. Lord, forgive us of
[2:07:39] our sins and many mistakes. First off,
[2:07:41] Lord, cleanse us. Lord, let us be as
[2:07:45] you're going to tell us. Let us be as
[2:07:46] that little child. Lord, be innocent and
[2:07:50] Lord, be available. make oursel
[2:07:54] available, Lord, for you to come on the
[2:07:55] scene, Lord, and speak to each and every
[2:07:58] heart here, Lord. That's the purpose of
[2:08:00] us coming, not just to sit here and look
[2:08:02] over at each other and and and all and
[2:08:05] even look up here, Lord, but to hear
[2:08:07] your voice and let it be the word of God
[2:08:10] spoken by lips of clay, but it may it
[2:08:12] come from your very thought that you had
[2:08:15] before the foundation of the world.
[2:08:17] Father, forgive us, Lord, if we say
[2:08:20] something maybe that somebody don't
[2:08:21] like, but we sure appreciate everybody
[2:08:23] being here. We appreciate the ones,
[2:08:26] Lord. Bless the ones that are sick.
[2:08:27] Brother Bob, Lord, being down at uh
[2:08:29] checking on his grandbaby visit for the
[2:08:31] first time there in South Carolina.
[2:08:34] Lord, I pray that you give them
[2:08:35] traveling mercies. Be with each one
[2:08:37] that's not here, Lord. Father, I pray
[2:08:38] that you'd bless us now in Jesus name.
[2:08:41] Amen. God bless you. Matthew 19:13.
[2:08:46] Then there were brought unto him little
[2:08:48] children. This is talking about Jesus
[2:08:50] now. That he should put his hands on
[2:08:52] them and pray, and the disciples rebuked
[2:08:55] them. But Jesus said, "Suffer little
[2:08:57] children and forbid them not to come
[2:09:00] unto
[2:09:01] me, for of such is the kingdom of
[2:09:05] heaven." And he laid his hands on them
[2:09:08] and departed then. You may be seated.
[2:09:10] Lord had his blessing. We'll go again to
[2:09:12] Matthew 18:E1.
[2:09:16] try not to be uh and they went some of
[2:09:19] them that went with me to the Methodist
[2:09:20] church last Sunday, I told them, "Forget
[2:09:22] it. I wasn't just going to preach 35
[2:09:24] minutes ever again." So, but anyway,
[2:09:27] don't get used to it. Matthew
[2:09:30] 18:1 says, "At the same time, the
[2:09:32] disciples came unto Jesus became
[2:09:34] disciples of Jesus saying, "Who is the
[2:09:36] greatest in the kingdom of heaven?" And
[2:09:38] Jesus called a little child unto him and
[2:09:40] set him in the midst of them and said,
[2:09:42] "Boy, oh my, could you imagine if that
[2:09:44] child knew what he was what what was
[2:09:46] going on? If that little child realized
[2:09:48] that he was he was standing in the hands
[2:09:51] of the creator, standing in the hands of
[2:09:54] the one that was going to save his soul
[2:09:55] when he got
[2:09:56] older."
[2:09:58] Wow. Jesus called the little child and
[2:10:01] said unto him, set him in front of him
[2:10:03] and said, "Verily I say unto you, except
[2:10:05] you be converted." Now watch. Except you
[2:10:07] be
[2:10:08] converted and become as a little child,
[2:10:10] you shall not enter into the kingdom of
[2:10:13] heaven. Who so therefore shall humble
[2:10:16] himself as a little child. Now that
[2:10:18] includes all us old ones, humble oursel
[2:10:21] as a little child, the same as the
[2:10:23] greatest in the kingdom of heaven. Now
[2:10:26] watch. And who so shall receive one such
[2:10:30] little child? Now look, he said in my
[2:10:32] name receiveth
[2:10:35] me, but whosoever shall offend one of
[2:10:38] these little ones which believe in me,
[2:10:41] it were better for him that a millstone
[2:10:43] were hanged around his neck and he were
[2:10:45] drowned in the depths of the sea.
[2:10:49] Amen. That's pretty real. That's Jesus
[2:10:53] talking. That ain't that ain't an
[2:10:54] interpretation. That's exactly what he
[2:10:55] said. He said it'd be better what? for a
[2:10:58] millstone to be hanged around the
[2:11:00] person's neck and they remember Job even
[2:11:02] said one time he said, "Oh, I wish I
[2:11:04] wasn't even born. I just wished I wasn't
[2:11:06] born that all these things are going on
[2:11:08] but you know
[2:11:09] what Job got a revelation one day though
[2:11:12] and he said I know that my redeemer
[2:11:15] liveth and he said in the last days I'll
[2:11:18] stand on this earth and in my flesh I
[2:11:22] shall see
[2:11:24] God." So what a great thing.
[2:11:27] Technology is
[2:11:38] not. So
[2:11:41] anyway, let's stand. We'll
[2:11:45] dismiss. I just Well, you know, Anderson
[2:11:48] was back there trying to help me with
[2:11:49] the uh the printer a minute ago and and
[2:11:53] uh he just unplugged it. plugged it back
[2:11:57] in, started working. So before you call
[2:11:59] a technician for hundred and something
[2:12:01] dollars an hour, unplug the thing and
[2:12:04] then plug it right back in. All right,
[2:12:06] give it a minute to boot up and then
[2:12:08] plug it back in because that's probably
[2:12:09] going to be your biggest
[2:12:11] problem. So now here we go. So now we
[2:12:14] look and we see that that we've had a
[2:12:16] baby
[2:12:17] dedication. And the way I want you to
[2:12:19] look at this, I want you to see that as
[2:12:21] dad's always said that we dedicate
[2:12:24] babies here and give them to the parents
[2:12:27] obviously, but we also give them to each
[2:12:29] one of us to live it before them.
[2:12:32] Now, you can say what you will, but a
[2:12:37] true Christian does not act like the
[2:12:40] world. A true Christian is separate from
[2:12:43] the world. Jesus was separate from the
[2:12:46] world. Listen, they hated
[2:12:48] him. They hated their very savior
[2:12:52] because he was not normal. He wasn't of
[2:12:54] their
[2:12:57] quality. But he was a creator of the
[2:13:00] world and they missed it. Could we be
[2:13:03] missing it now because of our ideas?
[2:13:06] Could we be missing it because of our
[2:13:08] doctrinal issues that as I was telling
[2:13:10] some of the the Methodists, you know,
[2:13:12] they they sprinkle. And I said, "Your
[2:13:15] founder didn't do that." I didn't tell
[2:13:18] them from the pullpit. I just told a
[2:13:19] couple guys there. I said, "Your founder
[2:13:21] did not
[2:13:23] sprinkle." John Wesley believed in water
[2:13:27] baptismo. Amen. Is everybody with me? So
[2:13:30] who who so who who told them they could
[2:13:34] do
[2:13:35] that? There's only two forces in this
[2:13:37] world. God and the devil. God can't lie.
[2:13:41] God can't change his word. So you figure
[2:13:44] out who the other guy
[2:13:46] was and we'll talk about that in just a
[2:13:49] minute. But the dedication part I was
[2:13:52] thinking yesterday of all the and I I
[2:13:55] was part of it
[2:13:57] myself. We come and brought Josh and
[2:13:59] Hannah basically the same way here to be
[2:14:02] dedicated and then
[2:14:05] sadly we didn't live the life in front
[2:14:07] of them.
[2:14:10] Sadly, we've dedicated many people
[2:14:13] here. Many children have been dedicated
[2:14:15] here and their parents not show up
[2:14:19] again.
[2:14:21] Now, the kid's not going to be held
[2:14:25] responsible, innocent, don't have a bad
[2:14:28] thought, can't sin like you and I can
[2:14:31] sin because we know better. They don't
[2:14:35] know better. Not until they get to the
[2:14:37] age of accountability, to the age where
[2:14:39] they know that they're doing something
[2:14:41] wrong. They know they're sinning. They
[2:14:43] know they're doing something against or
[2:14:45] contrary to the word of God. But here, I
[2:14:49] want to tell you that if we're
[2:14:51] commissioned to do that, then until you
[2:14:55] get yourself
[2:14:59] right, how you going to expect the kid
[2:15:01] to be right? I'm just going to preach
[2:15:04] family today. Is that all
[2:15:06] right? Cuz I want to tell you about a a
[2:15:08] woman here in the
[2:15:10] Bible. I want you to see and it's it's
[2:15:13] it's kind of strange that her name was
[2:15:14] Hannah. And that was my grandma's name.
[2:15:16] And she had a son and her old name old
[2:15:19] age named Samuel. And that was dad's
[2:15:21] name was Samuel. And granny was 42 when
[2:15:24] dad was born. I think his dad was in his
[2:15:26] 60s. So um let's look at 1st Samuel 1
[2:15:30] verse one. And let's look and see what
[2:15:33] kind of dedication we've we have as
[2:15:36] Christians. Now, not as Christians.
[2:15:38] Remember the Jesus said who believe in
[2:15:41] my name, who believe in me. All right?
[2:15:45] So, if you don't believe that the Lord
[2:15:46] Jesus Christ is your savior, how you
[2:15:48] going to get your kids to do the same
[2:15:50] thing? And we've seen many times before
[2:15:52] now, not here, but in the denominational
[2:15:54] world, they'll drop the kids off to
[2:15:56] Sunday school and then mom and dad goes
[2:15:58] and, you know, does whatever. They're
[2:16:00] just that's just a babysitter for
[2:16:02] them because when they get back home,
[2:16:04] they're going to hear the cussing, the
[2:16:05] swearing, the I ain't going to church
[2:16:07] and I don't love you no more. You
[2:16:08] understand what I'm saying? I want I
[2:16:10] hope you do. Cuz when we dedicate a
[2:16:13] baby, it's not just we put them in a we
[2:16:16] put them in a capsule and say, "Well,
[2:16:18] they're taken care of, but I'm going to
[2:16:21] go live anyway I want
[2:16:24] to." Then you then you fuss at the kids.
[2:16:27] I've already always told you and I know
[2:16:29] we don't believe in Santa Claus here,
[2:16:31] but
[2:16:32] uh we don't beat him up about it. We
[2:16:35] just tell them the
[2:16:36] truth that there's a man that'll save
[2:16:39] your soul, not give you a gift, and his
[2:16:42] name's the Lord Jesus, and he don't wear
[2:16:43] a red
[2:16:45] suit. But how many of you, don't raise
[2:16:47] your hand because it'll be
[2:16:49] 100%. Taught your kids there was a Santa
[2:16:52] Claus at about five years old, four
[2:16:53] years old, three years old. I know some
[2:16:55] of you didn't.
[2:16:58] But you still got caught into that
[2:17:00] influence. You lied to
[2:17:02] them and you expect them to tell the
[2:17:07] truth. You whip them for lying. Somebody
[2:17:10] ought whipped
[2:17:16] you. I'm going to preach
[2:17:19] anyway. But it's the
[2:17:21] truth. That's why and and the whole
[2:17:24] pretense of this sermon is that it's
[2:17:26] we're not going to just this is an
[2:17:29] event. This was an event this morning
[2:17:31] and we looked back on the events and we
[2:17:33] look look back on the pictures that we
[2:17:35] we pull up and and certain ones that are
[2:17:38] being dedicated. You never see them
[2:17:41] again. What have we
[2:17:43] dedicated? We've dedicated them to the
[2:17:45] Lord but dedicated you to raise them
[2:17:49] parents and then for us as a church. But
[2:17:51] now us as a church, we're not obligated
[2:17:54] to help you raise your kid if you don't
[2:17:55] bring it to
[2:17:57] church. We're not obligated to go in
[2:17:59] your home and try to change your home.
[2:18:01] You got to change your home. The first
[2:18:03] home you got to change is this
[2:18:05] one. You got to change this home first.
[2:18:08] When you change this home, the kids will
[2:18:11] see a
[2:18:15] difference. So there was a lady, her
[2:18:17] name was Hannah.
[2:18:20] Let's read about her story here real
[2:18:22] quick. Now there was a certain man of
[2:18:24] you can pronounce that of Mount Ephereim
[2:18:27] and his name was Elcana and the son of
[2:18:29] Jehoam the son of Elahue the son of Tou
[2:18:33] the son of Zeffe an Ephriotite and he
[2:18:35] had two wives the name of one was Hannah
[2:18:38] name of the other was Penaniah and
[2:18:40] Penaniah had children but Hannah had no
[2:18:43] children and this man went up out of his
[2:18:46] city yearly to worship and sacrifice it
[2:18:48] to the Lord. Remember what did he do? He
[2:18:50] did the things he was supposed to do. He
[2:18:52] did all the sacrifices back then. There
[2:18:55] was no Lord Jesus Christ as as a savior
[2:18:58] yet. They looked to Jehovah, somebody
[2:19:00] they didn't understand a lot of the
[2:19:02] times, but they understood that Moses
[2:19:05] saw him and they had a law and they
[2:19:07] lived under that law and as long as they
[2:19:09] made sacrifices, everything was okay.
[2:19:12] But remember, the ultimate sacrifice had
[2:19:14] not been made yet. All right? that the
[2:19:16] Lord Jesus had not died. And this man
[2:19:19] went out of his city to worship and to
[2:19:21] sacrifice unto the Lord of hosts in
[2:19:23] Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hapney
[2:19:25] and
[2:19:26] Phineas, the priest of the Lord were
[2:19:30] there. When the time was that Elen
[2:19:32] offered, he gave to Pani his wife, and
[2:19:36] to all her sons and daughters portions.
[2:19:38] Now watch. But unto Hannah, he gave a
[2:19:42] worthy portion, for he loved Hannah. It
[2:19:45] didn't change that she didn't have
[2:19:46] children yet. He still loved her. What
[2:19:49] am I saying is you got to bring love
[2:19:51] into your family first. You got to bring
[2:19:53] the love of husband and wife in first
[2:19:55] into your family. Make your sacrifices.
[2:19:58] Do your daily offerings. I'm talking
[2:20:00] about your daily
[2:20:02] offering. But unto Hannah he gave a
[2:20:04] worthy portion for he loved Hannah. But
[2:20:06] the Lord had shut up her womb.
[2:20:09] And her adversary, now watch, also
[2:20:12] provoked her sore for to make her fret
[2:20:15] because the Lord had shut up her
[2:20:18] womb. You and
[2:20:21] I have to live so that the world can
[2:20:25] tell we're
[2:20:28] different. The Bible compels us. The
[2:20:31] Lord Jesus compels us. Everything in
[2:20:34] scripture compels us to live different
[2:20:37] and look different and act different
[2:20:39] from the
[2:20:40] world. Everybody with
[2:20:46] me? My granddaughter slipped in the
[2:20:48] door. Is that Ellie with you? Hey
[2:20:51] Ellie, God bless you. You missed a
[2:20:58] dedication. But we're compelled to be
[2:21:00] different. So, so a baby dedication to
[2:21:02] me is different than just somebody
[2:21:04] bringing them up and like they do in
[2:21:05] different places. Even the Methodist
[2:21:06] church, they have a christening or a
[2:21:08] sprinkling of the water on the on the
[2:21:10] baby's head. But that's not according to
[2:21:12] scripture. There is no scripture that
[2:21:14] says you're you're not supposed to
[2:21:16] baptize them. But the only thing was is
[2:21:18] the disciples were getting a little ill
[2:21:20] with Jesus and or the people because the
[2:21:22] children were running around. Dad's
[2:21:24] always said, and I say 100%. Kids
[2:21:27] crying, kids going out with their
[2:21:30] parents to use the bathroom or to eat a
[2:21:33] little bite of
[2:21:34] something. Oh, for those of you that
[2:21:36] went last Sunday, we are not bringing
[2:21:38] donuts into this
[2:21:41] sanctuary.
[2:21:45] Ever. This is a house of
[2:21:47] God. It's not a place that we just come
[2:21:50] like a lodge. We come here to just sit
[2:21:52] down and eat and drink in this
[2:21:54] sanctuary. That's
[2:21:56] garbage. Sorry. That's the only way
[2:21:58] those people have been taught though. So
[2:21:59] that's the way they did it. Um I believe
[2:22:02] that you need to put on your best, be
[2:22:04] your best. If you're going to come to
[2:22:05] church and see God, if you're going to
[2:22:07] just come to church to see somebody
[2:22:08] else, then you know, you need to stay
[2:22:11] home. You can. Amen. Thank
[2:22:14] you. I know this is simple, but
[2:22:17] sometimes we need to all be kind of
[2:22:18] reminded of of these things.
[2:22:23] But it is a place for us to come. Do you
[2:22:26] know if you walked into a church, church
[2:22:30] tabernacle, sanctuary, whatever it was
[2:22:32] in the Old
[2:22:33] Testament, if that high priest didn't
[2:22:36] have on the exact attire, if they
[2:22:38] weren't covered in oil, if they didn't
[2:22:41] walk the right way, put on the right,
[2:22:43] you say, "Well, it don't matter what I
[2:22:44] wear." Well, if he wore a blue and
[2:22:46] should have wore a red, he died.
[2:22:49] You know, they tied ropes around the the
[2:22:51] high priest because they couldn't go in
[2:22:53] there. But if they if he fell over dead
[2:22:55] and did something wrong, they could drag
[2:22:57] him
[2:22:58] out. If that happened
[2:23:01] here, how serious are
[2:23:05] we? That's why we don't have dos and
[2:23:08] don'ts here. We
[2:23:09] don't. But the Bible says, "Dress
[2:23:12] modest, be
[2:23:14] different. Women be women, men be men.
[2:23:19] But if we come in this house, watch it
[2:23:21] as he did so year by
[2:23:25] year. So he did it. He come to church.
[2:23:28] He did his service to God. Even though
[2:23:32] as yet Samuel had not been born
[2:23:34] yet. Everybody with me? Samuel was not
[2:23:38] born yet because he come through Hannah
[2:23:39] and God shut her womb
[2:23:42] up to give you the opportunity to see
[2:23:45] what's going on today.
[2:23:49] Word of God ever
[2:23:51] true. It was written for us. Bible says
[2:23:54] it was written for our admonition whom
[2:23:55] the ends of the world have come
[2:23:57] upon. And he did so year by year when
[2:24:00] she went up to the house of the Lord. So
[2:24:02] she provoked her, therefore she wept and
[2:24:05] did not eat. In other words, her
[2:24:06] adversaries were
[2:24:09] women. So she provoked her, therefore
[2:24:12] she wept and did not eat. Then said
[2:24:14] Elana her husband to her Hannah, "Why
[2:24:16] weepest thou? And why eatest thou not?
[2:24:19] And why is thy heart
[2:24:21] grieved?" Now today as as we we see
[2:24:25] that, have we ever done that before?
[2:24:27] Have we ever fasted and and just did
[2:24:29] without some just to try to get before
[2:24:31] the Lord? And today coming to this
[2:24:34] dedication service, I want it to be when
[2:24:37] you leave here, it was a dedication of
[2:24:39] you, not of so much of the
[2:24:41] baby because we've sheltered the child.
[2:24:45] The child has been sheltered in the arms
[2:24:47] of God until the age of accountability.
[2:24:49] But most of us sitting here today are
[2:24:51] past that
[2:24:52] point several times
[2:24:56] over, lest we
[2:24:59] forget our age.
[2:25:03] But then you and I then now need to
[2:25:05] dedicate
[2:25:07] oursel. We've had dedications. We've had
[2:25:09] rededications. We've dedicated the
[2:25:11] building again. We've dedicated each
[2:25:13] other. We've we've had mar marriage
[2:25:15] renewal vows. And that's good. That's
[2:25:18] wonderful. I was thinking this
[2:25:20] morning, how many people I'm just going
[2:25:23] to preach. How many people stand before
[2:25:27] they want to do it either in a church or
[2:25:29] a venue and they want to dress up and
[2:25:33] they want to stand before a
[2:25:36] preacher, somebody you're not supposed
[2:25:38] to lie
[2:25:39] to. They stand before a preacher and
[2:25:42] say, "Hey, read these
[2:25:44] vows. For richer, for poorer, in
[2:25:48] sickness and in health, till death do us
[2:25:51] part."
[2:25:54] and five years later they're
[2:25:55] divorced. Somebody
[2:25:57] lied. You know what the problem was?
[2:25:59] They didn't bring that third person in
[2:26:01] into the into the
[2:26:03] situation. They didn't bring that third
[2:26:05] person in. They didn't bring Jesus
[2:26:07] Christ with them when they come up here
[2:26:08] or you won't get a divorce. If you have
[2:26:10] Jesus Christ in your heart, you can't
[2:26:11] divorce. You might have
[2:26:14] problems. And the men say and the
[2:26:17] sisters
[2:26:18] say they're louder than us.
[2:26:24] for some silly
[2:26:27] reason. Reason I'm telling you all this
[2:26:29] is sometimes we don't take things
[2:26:32] serious. Sometimes we do not take what
[2:26:34] we vow. And I'm going to preach on that
[2:26:37] probably somewhere in the seals. I'm
[2:26:39] going to preach on numbers 30 which is a
[2:26:42] a chapter of nothing but vows.
[2:26:45] Now
[2:26:47] remember, as I've said many times
[2:26:49] before, it's not the intimacy and it's
[2:26:52] not the the um bodily contact that
[2:26:55] marries
[2:26:56] you, right? It's the
[2:26:59] vow. God looks at your vow. If you
[2:27:03] sisters vow yourself to a man, you are
[2:27:06] vowed and just as married. Now, is that
[2:27:08] not correct or not? You say, "Oh, no,
[2:27:10] they've not." No, the consummation is
[2:27:12] not the marriage.
[2:27:14] And many times sorrowful in this age day
[2:27:17] and age, they've already consummated it.
[2:27:19] They're just going to do the legal
[2:27:21] thing. Well, I'm going to preach anyway,
[2:27:24] but it's true. But when are we going to
[2:27:27] get back to being pure? All of us. I'm
[2:27:30] talking about men, too. We always preach
[2:27:31] on a woman being a virgin. Why can't a
[2:27:33] man supposed to be one,
[2:27:35] too? And then you and I as Christians
[2:27:38] are supposed to be virgin in
[2:27:40] mind. Remember, we're a chasteed version
[2:27:42] to Christ.
[2:27:44] virgin to Christ. We are a version of
[2:27:47] Christ. But look at this now. Here we
[2:27:49] got a man. He's not thinking a thing
[2:27:52] about
[2:27:53] it. He knows Hannah's not
[2:27:57] consing and still would teach treats her
[2:28:00] just the
[2:28:02] same. But
[2:28:04] she
[2:28:06] initiates to the Lord what she
[2:28:09] wants. So Hannah rose up. No, said Elam
[2:28:13] her husband to her, "Hannah, why weepest
[2:28:15] thou? And why eatest thou not? And why
[2:28:17] is thy heart grieved?" Listen, she was
[2:28:20] in sore pain that she didn't have a
[2:28:24] kid. Have we been in sore pain that
[2:28:28] we've not birthed Christ in our life?
[2:28:31] That we've not had let the Holy Ghost
[2:28:33] live and live out through
[2:28:34] us? Don't be scared of that ghost. It's
[2:28:38] holy. It'll make you the same thing.
[2:28:41] Am not I better to thee than 10 sons? So
[2:28:45] Hannah rose up after they had eaten in
[2:28:47] Shallow and after they had drunk. Now
[2:28:49] Eli the priest. Now here we're bringing
[2:28:51] a priest in. All right. So Eli the
[2:28:54] priest sat upon a seat by a post of the
[2:28:56] temple of the
[2:28:59] Lord. And she's she was in bitterness of
[2:29:02] Saul. Listen, she was in
[2:29:05] travail. She was in tra Have you ever
[2:29:08] just been in travail for something? I'm
[2:29:10] telling you, you better get in travail
[2:29:12] for your children because I'm going to
[2:29:13] tell you something. We're at the arc
[2:29:16] age. Everybody with me on that? We're at
[2:29:19] the arc
[2:29:20] age. Remember, Noah built it. Noah
[2:29:23] preached it, but God shut the
[2:29:27] door. God shut the door. Noah wanted to
[2:29:30] keep it open so just in case somebody
[2:29:32] else will come in, but God shut the door
[2:29:35] and said, "That's enough."
[2:29:38] We're coming to that time
[2:29:41] now. She was in bitterness of soul and
[2:29:44] prayed unto the Lord and wept sore. And
[2:29:46] she vowed a vow. Now, here we are. She
[2:29:49] vowed a vow and said, "Oh Lord of hosts,
[2:29:52] if thou will indeed look on the
[2:29:54] affliction of thine handmmaid, and
[2:29:56] remember me, and not forget thine
[2:29:58] handmmaid, but will give unto thine
[2:30:01] handmmaid a
[2:30:04] manchild." She was pretty specific.
[2:30:07] a
[2:30:08] manchild. Then I will give him unto the
[2:30:10] Lord all the days of his life, and there
[2:30:12] shall no razor come upon his
[2:30:17] head. Somebody asked me one time said,
[2:30:20] "Well, why they got long hair? Why'
[2:30:21] Jesus have long hair? Why do people have
[2:30:23] long hair in in the in the Old
[2:30:25] Testament?" I said, "Well, they took a
[2:30:27] Nazerite vow. You read about it in the
[2:30:29] Bible. If you'll act just like Jesus,
[2:30:31] you can have long
[2:30:33] hair." Took care of that, didn't it? All
[2:30:37] right.
[2:30:39] So now watch. It came to pass she
[2:30:42] continued praying. Now look, she
[2:30:44] continued to pray. She didn't just have
[2:30:45] one little 15-second prayer and and went
[2:30:48] off. No, she kept praying. She kept
[2:30:50] praying. She kept
[2:30:53] praying. She wanted that
[2:30:55] child. You know why she wanted that
[2:30:58] child? Not for
[2:31:01] herself. Not for herself. She wanted
[2:31:04] that child to give that child to
[2:31:07] God. And she knew if she give it to God,
[2:31:11] he'd be different. He would be special.
[2:31:14] He would have an anointing. And you
[2:31:17] know, Samuel was a
[2:31:24] prophet. And watch now. Hannah, she
[2:31:27] spake in her heart. Only her lips moved,
[2:31:31] but her voice was not hurt. Therefore,
[2:31:34] Eli thought she had been drunken. And
[2:31:36] Eli said, "How wilt thou be drunken? How
[2:31:38] long wil thou be drunk? Put away thy
[2:31:40] wine from thee." He was just looking at
[2:31:42] the circumstances. And Hannah answered
[2:31:44] and said, "No, my lord. I'm a woman of
[2:31:46] sorrowful
[2:31:48] spirit. I have drunk neither wine nor
[2:31:50] strong drink, but I have poured out my
[2:31:53] soul before God." My soul before God.
[2:31:59] Count not thine handmade for a daughter
[2:32:00] of Bel, which was of evil God. For out
[2:32:04] of the abundance of my complaint and
[2:32:06] grief have I spoken here too. Then Eli
[2:32:10] answered and said, "Go in peace, and the
[2:32:12] God of Israel grant thee thy petition
[2:32:15] that thou hast asked of
[2:32:18] him." God grant the petition that you
[2:32:23] ask.
[2:32:24] Not your husband, not me as the
[2:32:27] preacher, but you ask. Whatever the
[2:32:30] Bible says, whatever you say. If you say
[2:32:34] to this mountain, not if you ask your
[2:32:36] preacher to do it for you. If you say to
[2:32:38] this mountain, be moved, it'll be moved,
[2:32:41] and don't doubt in your
[2:32:43] heart. She said, "Let thine handmmaid
[2:32:46] find grace in thy sight." So the woman
[2:32:48] went her way and did eat, and her
[2:32:49] countenance was no more sad. Listen, she
[2:32:52] got
[2:32:54] her portion that she was asking for. She
[2:32:57] was settled. She didn't have to be sad
[2:32:59] anymore. She didn't have to go around.
[2:33:01] She She knew that she was going to have
[2:33:03] that child. And they rose up in the
[2:33:05] morning early and worshiped before the
[2:33:06] Lord and returned and came to their
[2:33:08] house in Rama. And Elam knew Hannah, her
[2:33:11] his wife, and the Lord remembered her.
[2:33:14] Wherefore it came to pass when the time
[2:33:16] was come about after Hannah had
[2:33:18] conceived that she bare a son and called
[2:33:20] his name Samuel saying because I have
[2:33:23] asked him of the
[2:33:24] Lord. And the man Elcana and all his
[2:33:28] household went up to offer unto the Lord
[2:33:29] the yearly sacrifice and his vow. But
[2:33:32] Hannah went not up for she said unto her
[2:33:34] husband, I will not go up until the
[2:33:36] child be weaned and then I'll bring him
[2:33:37] that he may appear before the Lord and
[2:33:39] there abide forever. So in other words,
[2:33:41] he's going to be a child still going to
[2:33:42] be a child. She's going to wean him and
[2:33:44] then she's going to give him to God.
[2:33:46] Everybody with me? Well, there's a lot
[2:33:48] to that, but we'll not get into it
[2:33:49] because I want to get in the rest of
[2:33:51] it. And Ela and her husband said unto
[2:33:53] her, "Do what seemth the good tarry
[2:33:56] until you have weaned him. Only the Lord
[2:33:57] established his work." So the woman
[2:33:59] abode and gave her son suck until she
[2:34:01] weaned him. All right? And when she had
[2:34:03] weaned him, she remembered her
[2:34:08] vow. She didn't just remember it here.
[2:34:10] She didn't just remember when the
[2:34:12] preacher said it. She didn't remember it
[2:34:13] in the temple. She remembered that vow
[2:34:16] in
[2:34:17] herself. Everybody with
[2:34:19] me? She took him up when she had weaned
[2:34:21] him. She took him up with her. Now
[2:34:24] [Music]
[2:34:26] watch. Took
[2:34:29] sacrifices, flour, wine, bullet. She was
[2:34:33] doing what the word of God told her to
[2:34:37] do. Even if her husband didn't, she was
[2:34:41] going to do it.
[2:34:42] Everybody with me? I know there's many
[2:34:45] here that live maybe without a husband
[2:34:47] or or without a wife. And that's tough.
[2:34:49] I know it's tough. But you put your
[2:34:51] sufficiency in God. Let God do the work
[2:34:54] for you. Let God be your
[2:34:56] husband. He'll be the best one. He'll
[2:34:59] never fail
[2:35:02] you. The child was young. They slew a
[2:35:05] bulock and brought the child to Eli. She
[2:35:07] said, 'Oh my Lord, as thy soul liveth,
[2:35:10] my Lord, I am the woman that stood by
[2:35:12] thee here praying unto the Lord. For
[2:35:14] this child I prayed, and the Lord hath
[2:35:16] given me my petition which I ask of him.
[2:35:19] Therefore also I have lent him to the
[2:35:21] Lord. As long as he liveth, he shall be
[2:35:24] lent to the Lord. Now listen, she goes
[2:35:26] through all that. She travails. You
[2:35:27] know, she's got to be pregnant nine
[2:35:29] months. That still from the beginning of
[2:35:31] time till now. It never got quicker or
[2:35:33] longer. It's been nine months. So she
[2:35:35] had to wait nine months to have this
[2:35:37] child. She went through the travail of
[2:35:39] childbirth. All these things that went
[2:35:40] on that are not written in scripture,
[2:35:42] but it's in there. When you bear a
[2:35:44] child, you know how hap what happened.
[2:35:46] Sisters, you absolutely know what
[2:35:47] happened. If it was up to us to do it,
[2:35:49] Steve, we'd have one and that'd be it.
[2:35:51] There'd be no more. But it wasn't. It
[2:35:53] was left up to the sisters to do that.
[2:35:55] And praise God because he honored her
[2:35:58] and gave her a son in her old
[2:36:02] age. For this child I prayed, and the
[2:36:04] Lord hath given my petition which I
[2:36:06] asked of him. There so therefore also I
[2:36:08] have lent him to the Lord as long as he
[2:36:11] liveth, he shall be lent to the
[2:36:14] Lord, and he worshiped the Lord
[2:36:18] there. Samuel was a baby just like the
[2:36:21] rest of us. But when Samuel grew up, he
[2:36:23] became a prophet. He became the voice of
[2:36:27] Israel.
[2:36:28] If if Israel got anything, they got it
[2:36:31] from Samuel book because they believe in
[2:36:33] prophets. They believed in prophets.
[2:36:36] They believe God spoke through the
[2:36:37] prophets. Amos 2:9 tells
[2:36:40] them.
[2:36:41] Okay. Okay.
[2:36:46] Okay. Let me just
[2:36:49] wait. For those of you that don't know
[2:36:51] it, Brother Luis is interpreting for our
[2:36:54] Spanish brothers and they're we're
[2:36:56] getting the We're getting a tag team
[2:37:00] here. But we appreciate we appreciate
[2:37:02] our Spanish speaking brothers and
[2:37:04] sisters. We appreciate our
[2:37:06] interpreters. And for those of you that
[2:37:08] don't know it, we're working on a
[2:37:09] program to where as I'm speaking
[2:37:12] here, when it's archived on I mean I
[2:37:15] mean when it's live stream here, you'll
[2:37:17] hear his voice in Spanish preaching the
[2:37:19] same sermon
[2:37:24] instantly. God's good.
[2:37:27] He's good to give us brothers and
[2:37:28] sisters, maybe sisters, too. Sister
[2:37:31] Christine has to keep us all straight
[2:37:33] and keep us keep us throttled down and
[2:37:37] quietened so we don't run away from the
[2:37:40] uh from the interpreters. But praise
[2:37:43] God, there'll be one day we won't need
[2:37:44] an interpreter. We'll all know each
[2:37:46] other in our own language.
[2:37:51] Now, let's look at one more situation
[2:37:52] and then
[2:37:54] we'll we'll kind of preach for a
[2:37:56] minute. This is when Jesus was
[2:37:59] born. There was a man that lived in a
[2:38:02] temple. He was
[2:38:07] old. The Bible tells it about what he
[2:38:11] did, where he was at, and what he was
[2:38:13] waiting on. So, we're going to read it
[2:38:14] here. Luke 2 verse 22. And when the day
[2:38:17] of her purification according to the law
[2:38:19] of Moses were
[2:38:21] accomplished, they brought him to
[2:38:23] Jerusalem to present him to the Lord.
[2:38:24] Now, this is the baby Jesus. All right?
[2:38:26] And they had to circumcise him on the
[2:38:28] eighth day. Everybody with me on that?
[2:38:30] That was circumcision time. As it is
[2:38:33] written in the law of the Lord, every
[2:38:34] male that opened the womb shall be
[2:38:35] called holy to the Lord and to offer a
[2:38:38] sacrifice according to that which is
[2:38:40] said in the law of the Lord, a pair of
[2:38:42] turtle doves and two young pigeons.
[2:38:45] Is everybody with me on
[2:38:47] that? Went to church, did what the
[2:38:50] scripture
[2:38:52] says all the
[2:38:54] time. Are we listen? You don't have to
[2:38:58] bring two turtle loves and two pigeons
[2:38:59] and throw them on the altar over here
[2:39:01] and let's kill them. That'd be blood,
[2:39:03] guts, and feathers everywhere. You just
[2:39:05] got to bring
[2:39:06] yourself. Bring yourself as an offering.
[2:39:10] You come and offer yourself to God. And
[2:39:12] the problem is is we want to do like
[2:39:14] just like Aaron was preaching and we
[2:39:15] told them there there's many people in
[2:39:18] this
[2:39:19] world that want to be saved from
[2:39:23] hell. They're
[2:39:27] scared. But do you want him to be your
[2:39:29] Lord and
[2:39:30] Master? Do you want him to be your Lord
[2:39:34] and Savior? Not just your Savior.
[2:39:38] Because to bring it up a notch and for
[2:39:40] him to become your lord, he has to
[2:39:42] become the lord of your
[2:39:43] life apart from anything
[2:39:47] else. To a Christian, he we're we're the
[2:39:51] very center of God and he's the very
[2:39:52] center of
[2:39:54] us. And everything every decision,
[2:39:57] everything we do should be centered
[2:39:59] around God.
[2:40:03] Ann and Zach made a made a vow to have
[2:40:06] the baby dedicated and they did it. So
[2:40:10] God will honor it as long as they'll
[2:40:12] honor God. Same way with all of
[2:40:15] us and live before
[2:40:18] him. Behold, there was a man in
[2:40:20] Jerusalem whose name was
[2:40:23] Simeon. Now this old man lived in a
[2:40:28] temple.
[2:40:30] He was good, devout, but God spoke to
[2:40:34] him one day and said, "You'll not die
[2:40:37] till you see the
[2:40:39] Lord or the consolation of Israel." And
[2:40:43] the Holy Ghost was upon him, and it was
[2:40:46] revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost that
[2:40:48] he should not see death before he had
[2:40:50] seen the Lord's
[2:40:52] Christ. So what a
[2:40:54] consolation, don't you think? I mean
[2:40:56] every even
[2:40:58] even on the Sabbath day that's one thing
[2:41:01] you could
[2:41:02] do if that eighth day fell on the
[2:41:04] Sabbath day because the Sabbath day you
[2:41:05] didn't do anything but if that eth day
[2:41:07] of circumcision fell on that
[2:41:09] Saturday you circumcised so the temple
[2:41:13] was always full and here's Simeon and oh
[2:41:15] praise God that he was led by the Holy
[2:41:18] Ghost. Why can't we be led like that?
[2:41:20] Why can't when we come to church that we
[2:41:22] want to see the Lord's Christ, not see a
[2:41:24] group of people, not worried about what
[2:41:25] I'm going to preach, but hope that God
[2:41:28] speaks to
[2:41:29] you and helps you. Why waste your
[2:41:35] time? Cuz if you're not a Christian,
[2:41:37] you're in
[2:41:39] time. Time is against all of us. I know
[2:41:43] we sing that song, I'll not die,
[2:41:45] hallelujah, by and by. And I know that's
[2:41:47] hard for people to see. The graves are
[2:41:48] full of people that go went to this
[2:41:50] church, but they're not dead. They're
[2:41:53] more alive than we are. I'd rather be
[2:41:56] there than here.
[2:41:59] You say you're crazy. Thank
[2:42:05] you. But here's a man that devoted his
[2:42:08] life to see one kid, one
[2:42:13] baby. Cuz watch what he did.
[2:42:17] He stood there every day and watched
[2:42:18] that line go
[2:42:20] by. Never felt the move of the
[2:42:23] spirit. Never felt the move of the
[2:42:26] spirit. Hundreds, thousands of
[2:42:28] babies, men, babies. He knew that was
[2:42:33] going to be a manchild. He knew that he
[2:42:35] was going to be the savior. He had read
[2:42:37] Isaiah. He had read Jeremiah. He had
[2:42:40] read all these different things. He had
[2:42:42] known him as Jehovah.
[2:42:46] But that wasn't that baby's name. He
[2:42:48] knew the baby's name wasn't going to be
[2:42:50] Jehovah cuz I see the Lord's Christ.
[2:42:53] That's what he said. Won't see death
[2:42:55] till I see the Lord's
[2:42:58] Christ. And he came by the spirit into
[2:43:00] the temple. When the parents brought in
[2:43:03] the child Jesus to do for him after the
[2:43:04] custom of the
[2:43:06] law, then took he him up in his arms.
[2:43:09] What a
[2:43:10] time. What a
[2:43:13] time. I was thinking yesterday, Brother
[2:43:16] Dutch and Sister April Scott, they
[2:43:18] become grandparents. Had the first
[2:43:20] grandchild a couple days ago. And I told
[2:43:23] him, I said, "Listen, buddy. You're your
[2:43:24] your your world's
[2:43:26] changed. You're going to think
[2:43:28] different, act
[2:43:29] different. They never make a mistake. I
[2:43:32] got my grand baby back there." So, but
[2:43:35] they
[2:43:36] do.
[2:43:38] Sorry. But think about Simeon. He's
[2:43:41] getting old. His life's getting ready to
[2:43:43] be over. But he's
[2:43:45] promised by God in a
[2:43:48] revelation by the Old Testament that
[2:43:50] that child was going to be in the
[2:43:54] temple going to be born of a virgin. He
[2:43:57] had heard the
[2:43:59] rumors and here comes this little virgin
[2:44:02] in. She was still a
[2:44:04] virgin. She had not known a man, but she
[2:44:08] had a baby in her arms. And I'm sure
[2:44:10] that there was probably a 10-ft gap in
[2:44:13] front and a 10-ft gap behind her because
[2:44:16] she had a bad name. She had a bad
[2:44:18] reputation. But yet God sent that baby
[2:44:22] exactly the way that Isaiah said,
[2:44:25] "Behold, a virgin shall conceive and
[2:44:28] give birth to a
[2:44:30] [Music]
[2:44:33] manchild." But it didn't bother Simeon
[2:44:35] because Simeon was led by the Holy
[2:44:37] Ghost. When are we going to start being
[2:44:39] led by the Holy Ghost and not by every
[2:44:42] other ghost there
[2:44:45] is? Then he took him in his
[2:44:48] arms. He knew he had seen what he was
[2:44:51] looking for his whole life. He felt the
[2:44:54] pull. He felt the
[2:44:57] anointing. He felt that today that
[2:45:01] scripture had been fulfilled that he had
[2:45:03] been living for for
[2:45:05] years, years. He was an old man. It
[2:45:09] doesn't say when God revealed that to
[2:45:10] him, but I'm sure it wasn't just right
[2:45:13] then because he was waiting for the
[2:45:16] consolation of Israel. In other words,
[2:45:17] for Israel to come to their right state.
[2:45:22] The Messiah had to be on the
[2:45:25] scene. And he took him up in his arms
[2:45:27] and blessed God and
[2:45:29] said,"Lord, now let thy deserv thy
[2:45:32] servant depart in peace according to thy
[2:45:34] word, for mine eyes have seen thy
[2:45:42] salvation." What about a man lived his
[2:45:45] whole life and brother Donnie, one
[2:45:48] moment defined his whole
[2:45:50] life, but he had Jesus in his arms.
[2:45:54] He may not have known exactly what he
[2:45:55] was doing, but I'll promise you, he knew
[2:45:58] that that baby was going to grow up and
[2:46:01] be Isaiah, Jeremiah, and all the
[2:46:04] prophets. He was going to
[2:46:06] fulfill the
[2:46:09] scripture. And he said, "Let me depart
[2:46:11] in
[2:46:12] peace." That's what we should be as a
[2:46:14] Christian. When you meet the Lord, when
[2:46:17] you hold him in your
[2:46:19] arms, you say, "I've never done that
[2:46:21] before. You better try.
[2:46:25] You better bring him so close till he
[2:46:27] gets inside of you and lives your life,
[2:46:30] lives his life through
[2:46:33] you. And then what are you going to be?
[2:46:36] A living
[2:46:37] vessel,
[2:46:43] holy for my eyes have seen thy
[2:46:47] salvation.
[2:46:48] Now, just make a few comments here and
[2:46:50] then we'll go to we'll go to uh water
[2:46:53] baptism. Now, look, as we said before,
[2:46:56] babies have no sin. They were born in
[2:47:00] sin. We're all born contrary to what God
[2:47:03] wanted in the per in the first place.
[2:47:05] All
[2:47:07] right? But God made a provision. He sent
[2:47:10] his son. That baby we've been talking
[2:47:11] about grew up to be a man. And that man
[2:47:14] died on a cross to save every
[2:47:17] person. That's what I was preaching last
[2:47:19] weekend. The very most simple. For God
[2:47:22] so loved the world that he gave his only
[2:47:25] begotten son. That love is not the love
[2:47:26] you have for your parents or your family
[2:47:28] or your car or
[2:47:30] your That's a love of God called
[2:47:33] agape. For God so agape this world.
[2:47:37] Agape love is not conditional. It is
[2:47:41] unconditional.
[2:47:43] It never changes. As I said before, you
[2:47:47] may have bad days and good days, but God
[2:47:49] doesn't have a bad day and a good day.
[2:47:51] We need to start yielding oursel to
[2:47:53] what's inside of
[2:47:55] us. Everybody with
[2:47:58] me? But a baby has no
[2:48:00] sin. What's it sin for? What's it sin?
[2:48:03] What's it The process of sinning is
[2:48:06] what? You got to think it here first. Is
[2:48:08] that right? You think it here first.
[2:48:11] This is where sin began. And then it
[2:48:14] what? It develops down into and all your
[2:48:16] body does is displays what's inside of
[2:48:19] you. You can hold it. You can keep it
[2:48:21] secret every once in a while, but all of
[2:48:23] a sudden the real you is going to pop up
[2:48:26] somewhere. And I hope and pray that the
[2:48:28] real you today has already been
[2:48:30] dead, killed as we're going to the grave
[2:48:34] in just a few minutes. We're going to go
[2:48:35] out there and we're going to put our
[2:48:37] brother in a grave.
[2:48:39] But praise God, they put Jesus in a
[2:48:41] grave, but he's still not he's not there
[2:48:44] anymore. He resurrected and we're going
[2:48:46] to resurrect into newness of life. Have
[2:48:49] you ever listen, the Bible tells us at
[2:48:52] the very end of this, he said, "Behold,
[2:48:54] all things have become new."
[2:48:57] But when you get the new birth that's
[2:48:59] here, that takes you to that new image
[2:49:03] that you're heading toward that
[2:49:05] everybody that's gone on on that other
[2:49:07] side has met
[2:49:09] that. They've met that what was inside
[2:49:12] of them. They just developed into that.
[2:49:14] Had to leave the body here because of
[2:49:16] sin. Because they were born in
[2:49:19] sin. But the soul is what God's worried
[2:49:21] about. He's not worried about your body.
[2:49:24] He's worried about your soul. For God so
[2:49:26] loved the world, so agapeed the world.
[2:49:29] And
[2:49:30] agape is non
[2:49:33] conditional. Even your love for your
[2:49:35] wife is
[2:49:37] conditional. Oh,
[2:49:40] please. If your wife cooks
[2:49:44] good, keeps your clothes
[2:49:46] clean. If if
[2:49:51] if that's filio love. That's where you
[2:49:54] get the word from the
[2:49:57] um in Pennsylvania,
[2:49:59] Philadelphia. It's called the city of
[2:50:01] brotherly love. Philadelphia or filio
[2:50:04] love is the love you have for your
[2:50:06] friends, your brother. And you I love
[2:50:08] the deer
[2:50:10] hunt. Well, now what am I talking about
[2:50:13] at that at this point in my life? That's
[2:50:15] what I like to do. If I can't do that
[2:50:18] anymore, I'm going to go and love
[2:50:19] something else.
[2:50:21] That's why God's love is unconditional.
[2:50:24] He can't say, "Oh, oops. I'm sorry,
[2:50:26] Regina. I didn't see that. She made the
[2:50:28] biggest boo boo and she I'm gone. She
[2:50:31] gone. I'm out of here." No. He saw you
[2:50:33] making mistakes already before the
[2:50:35] foundation of the world. Before you ever
[2:50:37] come into human flesh, you made a
[2:50:39] mistake. But you were in the mind of God
[2:50:42] in the eternal part. If you have him
[2:50:44] today in your soul, if that soul inside
[2:50:46] of you is wanting something more than
[2:50:49] this stinking world can give you, they
[2:50:51] can put everybody they want to in the
[2:50:53] White House. They ain't going to turn
[2:50:54] this thing around. We are headed for
[2:50:59] disaster. Don't put your hopes in the
[2:51:01] stock
[2:51:03] market. Don't put your hopes in your
[2:51:07] job. You better put your hopes in Jesus
[2:51:10] Christ.
[2:51:12] Put him first.
[2:51:15] Seek ye first the kingdom of God. God,
[2:51:17] what can I do? What what what what
[2:51:19] what's in my plan? Instead of you making
[2:51:22] the
[2:51:22] plan. Because remember, we fail, we go
[2:51:26] in this direction, we go in that
[2:51:28] direction. God never
[2:51:31] fails. But the reason we don't
[2:51:33] baptize or sprinkle babies is this one
[2:51:37] thing. There's two separate things in
[2:51:39] Christianity that we look at. One is a
[2:51:41] dedication and one's a
[2:51:43] baptism. Everybody with me? They're not
[2:51:46] the
[2:51:47] same. There's two different things that
[2:51:50] we do. You can't intertwine them
[2:51:53] together and say that we baptized this
[2:51:56] baby. Well, that per that baby don't
[2:51:58] need to be baptized again. No, that baby
[2:52:02] is covered under the sinless part of
[2:52:04] Jesus Christ dying for it before it
[2:52:06] reaches the age of accountability.
[2:52:08] Everybody with me? But see, baptism
[2:52:12] doesn't make you a Christian.
[2:52:16] I wished it did. I'd go throw everybody
[2:52:18] in the lake.
[2:52:23] I would if that's all it was was
[2:52:25] salvation. We just started throwing them
[2:52:27] in the water. But that's not it. It's an
[2:52:30] outward expression that God has done
[2:52:33] something in your life because you were
[2:52:36] in sin.
[2:52:40] This baby's not in sin. This baby's
[2:52:43] being dedicated as something delicate
[2:52:45] for us to take care of until it reaches
[2:52:48] a point to where God can deal with that
[2:52:52] child. With me? But baptism, you can
[2:52:55] baptism a hundred babies, thousand
[2:52:58] million babies. That's not what God's
[2:53:01] talking about.
[2:53:06] But it's too young to know what baptism
[2:53:09] is because baptism is not just getting
[2:53:15] wet. It's an outward expression that
[2:53:18] something has changed on the inside or
[2:53:21] is changing or you feel a pull. You feel
[2:53:24] something
[2:53:30] different. Prophet tells us a child is
[2:53:33] too young to be baptized. A baptism is
[2:53:35] an outward expression that an inward
[2:53:37] work of grace has been done. In other
[2:53:39] words, we
[2:53:40] brought the we brought the kids up here.
[2:53:44] They didn't say, "Bring me to be
[2:53:47] dedicated," right? Because they don't
[2:53:49] know the difference. We as as parents
[2:53:51] then that's the connection we have.
[2:53:53] We're going to bring them up here and
[2:53:56] have them dedicated because they don't
[2:53:58] have to be
[2:54:00] baptized. Now when that kid grows up to
[2:54:03] 7 8 9 10 11 years old whatever it is age
[2:54:06] of accountability it's all different for
[2:54:07] others that's up to you and
[2:54:09] God then you've got to come to a place
[2:54:12] and said I have sinned and now I want to
[2:54:15] be different I want to be baptismal or
[2:54:21] changed from one to another one place to
[2:54:24] another remember but it doesn't save you
[2:54:26] but it's there there's no way that
[2:54:28] little Emerson is want to to outwardly
[2:54:31] express herself. Oh, she's doing it
[2:54:34] now. But it's
[2:54:39] uncontrollable. That's why I said I
[2:54:41] don't have problems with babies. I have
[2:54:44] problems with adults acting like
[2:54:48] babies. Why cry? Crying means you need
[2:54:52] something. You want something. They
[2:54:54] can't express theirelves, so they cry.
[2:54:58] But
[2:55:00] remember,
[2:55:02] dedication, we're doing
[2:55:04] it for
[2:55:06] them, right? Everybody with me? We'll be
[2:55:09] done here in a
[2:55:11] second. We're doing it for them. We are
[2:55:13] We are But now what you're doing is
[2:55:15] though, you're vowing a
[2:55:17] vow. Come on. You're vowing a vow that
[2:55:21] you're going to bring my ch I'm going to
[2:55:23] bring my child.
[2:55:25] give it to the preacher. Preacher gives
[2:55:27] it back to them. And somewhere in all
[2:55:29] that, we give it to God. But you got to
[2:55:31] give yourself to God
[2:55:33] first. Don't try to say, "Well, my my my
[2:55:36] baby's just my baby's done. She's sealed
[2:55:39] in. He's sealed in. He's he's good."
[2:55:41] Yeah, until the day of
[2:55:44] accountability. But what about
[2:55:46] you? What about
[2:55:48] me? I left of my own accord. And usually
[2:55:53] that means you take your kids with them
[2:55:55] with
[2:55:57] you. And for that I'm
[2:55:59] sorry. But there's somewhere you got to
[2:56:01] turn
[2:56:02] around. Start doing right. Start acting
[2:56:06] right. Start acting
[2:56:09] different. That's just one of the things
[2:56:11] I don't understand is
[2:56:13] people, and I even think I've said it in
[2:56:15] the Methodist
[2:56:16] church, Christianity is a broad brush
[2:56:19] nowadays.
[2:56:22] Everybody with me? You know what I'm
[2:56:23] talking about. It's a big old broad
[2:56:25] brush. Well, I'm a
[2:56:27] Christian. No, I thought the Bible said
[2:56:29] straight is a way. Narrow is the
[2:56:33] gate.
[2:56:35] Narrow a little brush. Which means you
[2:56:38] got to live different than just saying
[2:56:40] I'm a
[2:56:41] Christian. As Ryan sitting here in the
[2:56:44] front, he started in a Christian rock
[2:56:47] band. May I?
[2:56:50] He called it Christian rock, but he
[2:56:51] called it
[2:56:54] Croc. And I was watching one the other
[2:56:57] day, and when you can't tell, I mean,
[2:56:59] out of their mouth, they're singing
[2:57:01] gospel
[2:57:02] songs, but they look just like the rock
[2:57:05] people that are singing for the devil.
[2:57:07] There's got to be a
[2:57:09] separation. Kids, don't get caught in
[2:57:11] all that. Listen to the words. I said
[2:57:13] before, I don't mind if you listen to
[2:57:15] contemporary music. I want you to sing
[2:57:17] that song here though with a pure mind
[2:57:19] and with the Holy Ghost, not looking
[2:57:21] like the devil and trying to worship
[2:57:24] God. It's what I said. I'm a Christian.
[2:57:26] Have you ever been to church? No, but
[2:57:28] I'm a
[2:57:30] Christian. Baptist. I went to church
[2:57:32] when I was seven. I shook the hand of
[2:57:35] the preacher, got my letter. You been
[2:57:38] back to church yet? No, I ain't been
[2:57:39] back to church yet. They'll be 50 years
[2:57:42] old, 60 years old. Listen, you say, "Oh,
[2:57:44] it happens, folks. I've seen it at
[2:57:47] funerals. That's not the way this
[2:57:50] Bible's written. That's not the way
[2:57:52] Christianity is a walk. It is not a
[2:57:55] halftime. Every once in a while, a
[2:57:59] feature. It is your life.
[2:58:04] So, the baptism is an outward expression
[2:58:06] that something's going on different. You
[2:58:09] are now professing to the world.
[2:58:11] Somebody's not bringing you to this
[2:58:15] You're inside of you expressing out now
[2:58:18] what you're wanting to
[2:58:20] do. You can't keep it inside. Listen,
[2:58:23] when Simeon felt the move of the Holy
[2:58:25] Ghost, he went straight to that
[2:58:28] baby. It pulled him to that child. Why?
[2:58:32] Because he was looking for that child.
[2:58:35] Are we looking? That child's not a baby
[2:58:38] anymore. That child died, grew up, died
[2:58:42] to save your soul.
[2:58:44] Are we willing to let him do
[2:58:48] it? So, a baptism is a confession of an
[2:58:51] inward work of grace. It's been done. A
[2:58:53] little infant has no knowledge of sin.
[2:58:56] Therefore, when Jesus died, he died to
[2:58:58] take away the sin of the world. Because
[2:59:00] remember, he agapeed the world. He loved
[2:59:02] the world without condition. You say,
[2:59:04] "Well, he didn't save everybody." Hold
[2:59:06] on a minute. Yes, he
[2:59:09] did. Yes, he did. Or the Bible's wrong.
[2:59:14] You have a decision to
[2:59:19] make. He would have saved Judas. He
[2:59:22] would have saved Adolf
[2:59:26] Hitler. He even told Cain, he said, "If
[2:59:28] you'll do like your brother," God spoke
[2:59:29] to him straight lipped to ear. He said,
[2:59:31] "If you'll do like your brother, in
[2:59:33] other words, I'll accept your
[2:59:36] sacrifice." Why I said we're not a broad
[2:59:39] brush bunch of Christians. I ain't
[2:59:42] saying that
[2:59:43] again. But we're
[2:59:49] not. When Jesus was
[2:59:52] baptized,
[2:59:54] immersed, he went up straight out of the
[2:59:57] water, and lo, the heavens were open,
[2:59:58] and he saw the spirit of God descending
[3:00:00] like a dove, enlightening on him. He's
[3:00:01] talking about Matthew. And lo, a voice
[3:00:03] from heaven said, "This is my beloved
[3:00:04] son in whom I'm well
[3:00:06] pleased." Matthew 28:18.
[3:00:10] Jesus came and spake unto them, saying,
[3:00:12] "All power in heaven and earth be given
[3:00:13] unto me, me in heaven and in
[3:00:15] earth." There's three things we're
[3:00:18] compelled to do as Christians. Go,
[3:00:21] teach, and baptize. Everybody with me? I
[3:00:24] got it right there. Go ye therefore
[3:00:27] comma and teach all nations comma
[3:00:31] baptizing them in the name that is not
[3:00:36] names that is
[3:00:38] name. Father's not a name. Son's not a
[3:00:41] name. Holy Ghost is not a name. I'm
[3:00:44] going to read you here in a minute.
[3:00:44] Jehovah is not God's
[3:00:46] name. It's a
[3:00:48] title. It's a title to a name. So what's
[3:00:52] he saying? Go baptize in the name of who
[3:00:55] you know the father is, who you know the
[3:00:57] son is, and who you know the holy ghost
[3:00:58] is. It's the Lord Jesus Christ.
[3:01:02] Teaching them to observe all things
[3:01:04] whatsoever I have commanded you. And lo,
[3:01:06] I'm with you always, even until the end
[3:01:08] of the world. Name means a word or
[3:01:11] combination of words by which a person,
[3:01:13] place, or thing, a body or class or any
[3:01:17] object of thought is designated, called
[3:01:20] or known. In other words,
[3:01:22] designated Aaron Roberts, raise your
[3:01:26] hand. Aaron Roberts, raise your
[3:01:29] hand. Aaron Roberts, raise your hand.
[3:01:32] Oh, there's only one now. Humans, raise
[3:01:35] your
[3:01:36] hand. Fathers, raise your hand. Sons,
[3:01:40] raise your
[3:01:43] hand. That was a lot. Aaron Roberts,
[3:01:47] raise your hand.
[3:01:51] one one person raised their hand because
[3:01:54] he's
[3:01:55] identified with that name is how he's
[3:01:59] identified. He's a father, he's a son,
[3:02:01] he's a human. Like all y'all raise
[3:02:02] everybody raising their hand, right? But
[3:02:04] only one Aaron Roberts, raise your hand.
[3:02:06] Well, that's pretty
[3:02:10] consistent. Yeah, I know. I know I was a
[3:02:13] little slow. I kind of give you a little
[3:02:14] time in
[3:02:15] between, but Aaron Roberts, raise your
[3:02:18] hand. happens every
[3:02:21] time. So now in Acts
[3:02:24] 2:38, Peter said unto them, "Repent and
[3:02:27] do different than what Jesus
[3:02:29] said." That's not what he said cuz Peter
[3:02:33] had just received the Holy Ghost which
[3:02:35] was inside of Jesus speaking to the
[3:02:37] people. Am I correct? Or you got two or
[3:02:40] three different Holy Ghost? You got one
[3:02:41] Holy Ghost.
[3:02:45] be baptized every one of you in the name
[3:02:48] of Jesus Christ for the remission of
[3:02:51] your sin and you shall receive the gift
[3:02:52] of the Holy Ghost. What a what a promise
[3:02:55] for the promise is unto you and your
[3:02:56] children and Roberts raise your hand.
[3:02:58] Okay, see there I can't even trick
[3:03:01] him because he's
[3:03:04] identified. You know, you sitting we
[3:03:06] were sitting the other day and about
[3:03:07] 1500 people. We were at a um wild game
[3:03:10] supper and I didn't jump every time a
[3:03:13] name
[3:03:15] was it wasn't
[3:03:17] mine. It wasn't my name. They didn't
[3:03:19] call my name. They called Aby's They
[3:03:23] called Abby Grace Roberts and she about
[3:03:26] melted. I was going to have to give her
[3:03:29] some She had to stand up in front of
[3:03:32] 1500 people so they could bring her her
[3:03:34] prize. But there's not another person in
[3:03:36] 1500 people. There's not another person
[3:03:38] stood up that was Abby Grace
[3:03:42] Roberts. One faith, one Lord, one
[3:03:47] baptism. Let's continue. Mark
[3:03:50] 16:15. This is the same version of what
[3:03:52] Jesus was telling them in Matthew. Go ye
[3:03:55] into all the world, preach the gospel to
[3:03:57] every creature. He that believeth and is
[3:03:59] baptized shall be saved, but he that
[3:04:01] believeth not shall be damned. John 4:1
[3:04:05] when therefore the Lord knew how the
[3:04:06] Pharisees had heard that Jesus, excuse
[3:04:09] me, made and baptized more disciples
[3:04:11] than John, though Jesus himself baptized
[3:04:13] not but his disciples. So the discip if
[3:04:15] the disciples had to be baptized, you
[3:04:17] going to have to be
[3:04:19] baptized because remember Paul's going
[3:04:21] to meet a group of people that was
[3:04:23] preaching and the Holy Ghost fell on
[3:04:25] them, but immediately what what Paul
[3:04:27] tell them? You need to go be baptized.
[3:04:32] Ephesians
[3:04:33] 3:14, for this cause I bow my knees unto
[3:04:36] the father of our Lord Jesus Christ, in
[3:04:39] whom the whole family in heaven and
[3:04:43] earth is
[3:04:47] named. Exodus 6:3, I appeared unto
[3:04:50] Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob by the name of
[3:04:53] God Almighty, but by my name Jehovah,
[3:04:56] was I not known to them. Jehovah is not
[3:04:58] a name. It's a title.
[3:05:02] Matthew 18:1 19 again I say unto you
[3:05:05] that if two of you shall agree on earth
[3:05:06] as touching anything that they shall ask
[3:05:09] it shall be done for them of my father
[3:05:11] which is in heaven for where two or
[3:05:13] three are gathered in my name there I am
[3:05:18] in the midst of them John 14:13 Now
[3:05:21] listen let me ask you a question who's
[3:05:22] he talking about right
[3:05:24] there Jesus said in my
[3:05:27] name there I'll be in the midst who who
[3:05:29] is who he talking about
[3:05:31] Roberts. He didn't raise his hand when I
[3:05:34] said in the name of the Lord Jesus
[3:05:35] Christ or Jesus
[3:05:37] Christ. John 14:13, "Whatsoever you
[3:05:40] shall ask in my
[3:05:43] name, that will I do, that the Father
[3:05:47] may be glorified in the Son. If you
[3:05:49] shall ask anything in my name, I will do
[3:05:53] it." Acts 8:12. But when they believed
[3:05:56] Philip preaching the things concerning
[3:05:58] the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus
[3:06:00] Christ, they were baptized both men and
[3:06:03] women. Acts 8:14. Now when the apostles
[3:06:06] were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had
[3:06:08] received the word of God, they sent
[3:06:10] Peter and John, who when they were come
[3:06:12] down, prayed for them that they might
[3:06:13] receive the Holy Ghost. For as yet he w
[3:06:16] yet he was fallen upon none of them.
[3:06:18] Only they were baptized in the name of
[3:06:20] the Lord Jesus. Then laid they their
[3:06:23] hands on them, and they received the
[3:06:25] Holy Ghost. There's something connected
[3:06:27] to that name, baptism, right name, Holy
[3:06:33] Ghost. Acts 10:47, can any man forbid
[3:06:36] water that these should not be baptized
[3:06:38] which have received the Holy Ghost as
[3:06:40] well as we? And he commanded them, this
[3:06:42] is Pet Paul, and he commanded them to be
[3:06:44] baptized in the name of the Lord. Then
[3:06:46] prayed they him to tell you certain
[3:06:49] days. Acts 19
[3:06:54] verse1 this is Paul again he said unto
[3:06:56] them unto what were you baptized and
[3:06:58] they said unto
[3:07:01] John then Paul said John barely baptized
[3:07:04] with the baptism of repentance saying
[3:07:05] unto the people that they should believe
[3:07:07] on him now who's that
[3:07:09] him Jesus Christ not a father not a son
[3:07:12] not a holy ghost that's not a name those
[3:07:14] are
[3:07:14] titles that they should believe on him
[3:07:17] which should come after him that says on
[3:07:20] Christ
[3:07:21] Jesus. When they heard this, they were
[3:07:23] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
[3:07:26] And when Paul laid hands on them, the
[3:07:28] Holy Ghost came on. It looks like that
[3:07:29] kind of connects
[3:07:31] together. And they spake with tongues
[3:07:33] and
[3:07:35] prophesied. Let's read this and then
[3:07:37] we'll close. Musicians, come
[3:07:40] up. A song and psalm and song at the
[3:07:44] dedication of the house of David.
[3:07:47] I will extol thee, oh Lord, for thou
[3:07:49] hast lifted me up and hast not made my
[3:07:51] foes to rejoice over me. Oh Lord my God,
[3:07:56] I cried unto thee and thou hast healed
[3:07:58] me. Oh Lord, thou hast brought up my
[3:08:00] soul from the grave. Thou hast kept me
[3:08:02] alive that I should not go down to the
[3:08:05] pit. Why? Because he dedicated himself
[3:08:09] right here. We know he was dedicating
[3:08:11] the temple, but this is the temple. Sing
[3:08:13] unto the Lord, oh you saints of his.
[3:08:15] Give thanks at the remembrance of his
[3:08:17] holiness. For his anger endureth but a
[3:08:20] moment, and his favor is life. Weeping
[3:08:24] may endure for a night, but joy cometh
[3:08:28] in the
[3:08:29] morning. Joy cometh in the morning. So
[3:08:33] what are we doing
[3:08:34] here? We're
[3:08:36] Christians. All
[3:08:38] right? We have made our confession.
[3:08:43] We have not made a dedication
[3:08:46] yet. The dedication was
[3:08:49] brought here. All right. By the
[3:08:55] parents, but we're going to go to a
[3:08:56] baptismal service that our brother has
[3:08:59] confessed that he wants to show the
[3:09:01] world that something has
[3:09:03] changed, that something is different
[3:09:06] than it was
[3:09:08] before. We believe in baby dedication.
[3:09:10] Absolutely. We do it all the time.
[3:09:13] But I'm telling you, don't make the
[3:09:15] mistake of thinking that's all you got
[3:09:18] to do. Let's stand our
[3:09:20] feet. It's the whole Christian walk is a
[3:09:26] life. A
[3:09:28] life. The
[3:09:33] baptism. The whole family in heaven and
[3:09:36] earth is named what? The Lord Jesus
[3:09:39] Christ.
[3:09:42] Because when I told Aaron to raise his
[3:09:44] hand, I said, "Aaron
[3:09:46] Roberts." Now, there might have been.
[3:09:48] There's a couple Rebecca's in here and
[3:09:50] there's a couple of other people in here
[3:09:51] that could have raised their hand if I
[3:09:52] had just said, "Rebecca, raise your
[3:09:55] hand." But Aaron Roberts is his full
[3:09:59] name. Not with the other, but we knew
[3:10:02] who. Did y'all know exactly who I was
[3:10:04] talking about? If you knew Aaron, you
[3:10:05] know he's sitting right
[3:10:07] there. Aaron Roberts, Lord Jesus.
[3:10:12] baptizing them in the name of the father
[3:10:14] and of the son and of the holy ghost. We
[3:10:17] are which is the name of the lord Jesus
[3:10:19] Christ. That's a Catholic doctrine and
[3:10:22] it's wrong. It's false. The name of the
[3:10:25] Lord Jesus Christ puts you in a good
[3:10:28] position to receive the Holy
[3:10:30] Ghost for the promises to you and your
[3:10:33] children to them that are far off. We've
[3:10:36] read that many times. You ought to see
[3:10:38] those people scrambling in the
[3:10:39] Philippines when we have those mystery
[3:10:41] exposing and and a brother stands up and
[3:10:43] says, "I'll give you $10,000 if you can
[3:10:45] show me where anybody was baptized any
[3:10:48] other way than the name of the Lord.
[3:10:49] Name of the Lord Jesus or Lord Jesus
[3:10:51] Christ in the Bible. I'll give you
[3:10:53] $10,000." Well, buddy, $10,000 to a
[3:10:55] Filipino. Well, to us, too. But that's a
[3:10:58] year salary to them. They tear their
[3:10:59] Bibles up trying to find it. You can't
[3:11:01] find it. It ain't there. God does his
[3:11:05] things right. and he doesn't write the
[3:11:07] first time. So I take today we're going
[3:11:10] to go to a watery grave, but I ask you,
[3:11:12] have you dedicated
[3:11:15] yourself just as we dedicated this
[3:11:17] child? Have you dedicated your life,
[3:11:20] your service, and whatever you have,
[3:11:22] have you dedicated it to the Lord? If
[3:11:25] you haven't, it's time to do it
[3:11:27] again. I mean,
[3:11:30] rededication. We baptized some of you a
[3:11:32] couple times, maybe some three times.
[3:11:34] That's okay. But there's somewhere you
[3:11:36] got to put that stake down and say,
[3:11:38] "This is it, Satan. I've done everything
[3:11:40] God told me to do the right
[3:11:44] way. So back
[3:11:47] off. Back off. You have that ability to
[3:11:50] say, "Back off, Satan. I've done
[3:11:52] everything." But now, if you hadn't, he
[3:11:54] can stand right there, know your
[3:11:59] line, and still just keep bothering you
[3:12:02] and bothering you and bothering you.
[3:12:06] Listen, never in my
[3:12:09] life. And my dad didn't do it
[3:12:12] either. He didn't
[3:12:15] preach
[3:12:17] that. You got to be a Christian or
[3:12:20] you're going straight to hell. Now, if
[3:12:23] you're not, you're going. But there's
[3:12:26] grace in there and there's love in
[3:12:28] there. Know
[3:12:30] Jesus. Get to know him intimately.
[3:12:34] If not, there is a devil's hell that's
[3:12:36] waiting on
[3:12:37] everybody. I don't care how good you
[3:12:40] are. I don't care how nice you are to
[3:12:44] people. There's going to be a lot of
[3:12:46] nice people in
[3:12:47] hell. But there's not going to be one
[3:12:50] person in
[3:12:51] hell who has Jesus Christ in their soul.
[3:12:54] Not
[3:12:55] one. Not one. He's already went to hell
[3:12:59] for
[3:13:01] me. He went through a devil's grave. He
[3:13:03] went through hell for me. But as he
[3:13:07] resurrected in newness of life, so when
[3:13:09] we read that out here, that's what's
[3:13:10] going to happen. We're going to
[3:13:12] resurrect in newness of life. My dad and
[3:13:15] brother Tatum and all the different
[3:13:16] ones, they're not coming back here
[3:13:19] old. They're coming back here
[3:13:21] newness of
[3:13:23] life. But you got to know him here to
[3:13:27] carry him over there and for him to
[3:13:29] carry you back here. Oh, what a If
[3:13:32] you're not a Christian today, I hope you
[3:13:34] don't
[3:13:35] sleep until you find that person. I'm
[3:13:38] talking about not a message, not God
[3:13:40] sent a
[3:13:41] prophet. You find Jesus Christ and I'll
[3:13:44] promise you, he'll point you to the
[3:13:46] scripture. He'll point you to the truth.
[3:13:48] He can't because remember somebody told
[3:13:51] me one time, God don't make a
[3:13:52] mistake. I think I say it about every
[3:13:54] service. God doesn't make a mistake.
[3:13:56] Never has, never will.
[3:13:59] And he put all he put everything he
[3:14:01] thought right
[3:14:02] [Music]
[3:14:04] here. Let's sing a song.

[3:14:56] Lord. So glad I'm
[3:15:02] yours. Oh, so glad I'm yours. Listen,
[3:15:06] you're somebody's today. You got to
[3:15:09] decide whether you're God's or the
[3:15:13] devil. I still believe in good
[3:15:15] oldfashioned salvation.
[3:15:17] I believe in the works of God. I believe
[3:15:20] the Bible has found and I believe we've

[3:16:02] Don't turn that voice
[3:16:04] down. That voice is trying to tell you,
[3:16:07] "Come unto me all that are labored and
[3:16:09] heavy laden, and I'll give you rest."
[3:16:12] Don't try to get in the way. The problem
[3:16:14] is we get in the way.
[3:16:16] Let's look to him. He said, "I am the
[3:16:18] way. I am the truth. And I am the life."

[3:16:25] to figure it out.
