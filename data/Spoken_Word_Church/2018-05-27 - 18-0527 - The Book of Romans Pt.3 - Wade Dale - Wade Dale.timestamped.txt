[1:19] it's different but we're going we're
[1:20] talking about the book of Romans I want
[1:22] us to like I said it bracelet and he'll
[1:27] do just fine
[1:30] we heard from Kristen yeah as far as you
[1:40] know yeah yeah I think this I told
[2:01] anything yet
[2:02] Jim the second or something next wait
[2:11] less you got a holiday this yeah coming
[2:14] up the wall I'm at it we need to
[2:16] remember them home all day we don't
[2:18] remember the lab ones we remember the
[2:20] one just went home Memorial Day is for
[2:30] those that have already passed
[2:31] it's a memorial for those that have
[2:35] already gone you don't only remember the
[2:41] ones that went on is Memorial Day back
[2:43] up days ones we remember the loudly yes
[2:47] you thank them for their service
[2:49] thank you so now we're in a book of
[2:52] Romans now guess get started faces a new
[2:55] book of Romans we begin by telling you
[2:58] that Paul was not in Rome all right Paul
[3:01] was going to Rome so he would had
[3:04] studied the wrong he had been her own
[3:06] cooking Roman citizen right calling for
[3:09] Roman citizen and he knew the ways of
[3:12] the Romans they were completely painting
[3:14] right right okay they were completely
[3:19] pagan beautiful honey dripping out
[3:22] by a filter that huh picked it up took
[3:25] the picture that man well we just lifted
[3:30] the filter up and I took the picture as
[3:32] it was dripping down some okay
[3:34] makes me when we're gonna extract next
[3:36] week so the Lord forgive us we get crop
[3:38] on honey insulin thank the Lord and the
[3:41] bees but we come down here and we were
[3:43] looking and I found out something too
[3:46] okay that reading the King James Version
[3:50] is good but I went back and found my
[3:52] emphatic die Glocke everybody knows what
[3:55] that is that the Latin Vulgate this is
[3:56] the original not the King James
[3:59] transcribed this is what they
[4:01] transcribed from okay and it's really
[4:04] good to read this I like to read other
[4:06] commentary but this is the pure word
[4:10] this is exactly translated from what was
[4:12] written when Paul Ridd with his own hand
[4:15] to what is saying and then they took
[4:18] this and made the King James Version of
[4:20] it now we know that it's been verified
[4:22] but no brother Brian said that that was
[4:24] the King James Version was diversion
[4:26] that they got like and that he used and
[4:30] it was but in order correctly we're
[4:34] going to read this and we've already
[4:35] went went through some of this and I'm
[4:37] gonna come back that much but Romans is
[4:39] the longest letter that Paul wrote to
[4:41] the Christians in Rome and it's and the
[4:45] letter is long because he brings just
[4:49] like rough to me ruins and Hebrews are
[4:50] probably the two best books because what
[4:53] he does even in Romans he goes back into
[4:56] the Old Testament gets a lot of the Old
[4:58] Testament scroll updates them in and
[5:03] that's what he a lot of times folks if
[5:04] you'll really remember what you read in
[5:06] the Old Testament he's quoting Old
[5:08] Testament scripture thank you and if
[5:10] you're looking here Scott we got stoked
[5:12] Leo Scofield does a good job stopping
[5:14] you in relating back to an Old Testament
[5:16] scripture in that middle middle part
[5:19] right here that's why I'm brother round
[5:21] I believe like Scofield
[5:22] all these commentary they're good some
[5:24] of them are not good but this in the
[5:26] middle is exactly if Paul was talking
[5:28] about something toefield would relate
[5:31] you back to Deuteronomy 10:17 and all
[5:34] different one even back to Matthew Roman
[5:38] didn't take you through the scripture
[5:39] that's why I'm like let's go Phil and
[5:41] this is the King James Burke Scofield
[5:44] King tank version with all the
[5:46] commentaries and then you've got your
[5:49] Twilight this app because you can match
[5:51] that go to your strong concordance and
[5:54] it tells you what that word means and
[5:57] how many times it's been used and what
[5:59] the book to the Bible is used in so I
[6:01] like this after the Jakarta is the name
[6:05] of the after the Bible isn't in you got
[6:08] different application I look to see if
[6:11] they had any dialogue but they
[6:13] did not but I got this years ago and I
[6:18] like looking through it because it tells
[6:19] you exactly what he said cuz look look
[6:22] at verse 11 right here I got verse 11
[6:24] I'm gonna read it to you
[6:26] out of the original everybody see that
[6:29] for I'm greatly desired to see you that
[6:33] I may impart to you some spiritual gift
[6:36] for your firm establishment now that's
[6:40] what Paul said in the original that was
[6:43] his original letter and then man
[6:45] translated it which is fine too for a
[6:49] long to see you that I may impart of you
[6:50] some spiritual gift to the end you may
[6:52] be established this is for your firm
[6:55] establishment so we're going to try to
[6:57] now as we go
[6:59] read King James we're going to come in
[7:02] on it and then I'm going to read you
[7:04] what it says in the in the Dyke lot and
[7:07] I think we got down to we got the worst
[7:10] 18 so let's go to 18 and let's talk
[7:14] about this for a minute let's go back up
[7:16] to 17 now you read it on this screen and
[7:19] I'm gonna read it to you right here but
[7:22] the righteousness of God my faith is
[7:24] revealed there in order to in order to
[7:27] faith as it has been written but the
[7:32] righteous by faith shall live so you're
[7:36] eating for therein is the righteousness
[7:37] of God revealed from faith to faith as
[7:40] it is written the just shall live by
[7:41] faith
[7:42] now we know that Scripture comes from
[7:45] two places in the Bible right one of
[7:50] them is Ibaka - in 4 and in Galatians
[7:53] 3:11 but about the 2 and 4 in the Old
[7:56] Testament the Bible tells us to just
[7:59] show that by faith what happened was
[8:01] that man didn't catch that morning
[8:03] Brooker man didn't catch that
[8:07] okay but a man named Martin Luther
[8:14] reading the Bible read the just shall
[8:16] live by faith and turn the world upside
[8:18] down just by that one little scripture
[8:20] ok and we make it into a little more
[8:22] that this afternoon but I'm gonna have
[8:24] to background son for the breach of the
[8:27] seal but the just shall live by faith is
[8:30] totally contrary to any Roman doctrine
[8:34] any Roman idea Roman Catholic Church
[8:36] Roman Catholic Church that's where the
[8:40] Turk came out of was Rome right and the
[8:45] nastya Rome that was all done in Rome so
[8:48] what what I'm telling you is when you
[8:51] read this that's why I want you I've
[8:53] always been a person where you just
[8:54] don't tell me what it says give me the
[8:55] background let me know
[8:57] what Paul is I actually think it right I
[8:59] try to put myself and you should do the
[9:01] same thing cuz if God's talking to you
[9:03] he's not talking to Paul he stopping to
[9:07] you sure he said something to Paul
[9:09] because you weren't a lot of its time
[9:11] but Paul knowing an end of it you know
[9:13] how great this is
[9:15] listen how God works Paul died in 80-66
[9:24] somewhere there he didn't even know John
[9:29] he knew done
[9:30] but John went to Patmos after that Paul
[9:34] yath and Paul had no scripture old are
[9:37] new that told him about see yet the
[9:41] seals that we preached and the seals
[9:43] that brother Branham brought is laced
[9:45] all in the book of Romans and all in the
[9:47] book of Hebrews and everything - Paul
[9:48] wrote Grievous wolves all these
[9:51] different things he knew that tell us
[9:53] what there are some among you look right
[9:57] here where the wrath of God is revealed
[9:58] from heaven against all ungodliness and
[10:00] unrighteousness of men who hold the
[10:04] truth they hold the very truth in their
[10:08] hand and they turn and make it
[10:09] unrighteousness now the Bible says here
[10:12] in the original says besides the wrath
[10:15] of God is revealed from heaven in regard
[10:18] to all impiety and injustice of those
[10:21] men who drew injustice suppress the
[10:25] truth you see the meaning behind that
[10:29] suppress the truth and that's what
[10:32] they've done they helped the tree
[10:33] because how can you hold the truth that
[10:35] being righteous the truth is the truth
[10:38] is the truth right and the truth is
[10:40] righteous but when you watch suppress
[10:42] the truth not what did they do when that
[10:45] first horse rider went out in the first
[10:47] church age first research agency was a
[10:50] lot righteous man church but it was all
[10:54] our position what did they do they
[10:55] suppress the truth sir anthias all those
[10:58] won in Iran it's this time Saran this
[11:00] branding the doctrine that Jesus wasn't
[11:01] God through the rivers or
[11:02] we see that in a message now that was an
[11:05] old devil from a long time ago
[11:06] grocery this is dead and gone but the
[11:09] doctrines not that's right I'm playing a
[11:11] messy fix that same demon up and watch
[11:18] suppress the truth and that's the
[11:21] problem we suppress the truth you can't
[11:23] do a leg of the truth but you can
[11:24] suppress it and that's what Paul is
[11:26] telling the Romans that there's men
[11:29] among you who hold the truth now
[11:32] remember the tree at that time was not
[11:35] the Bible
[11:36] just think what ready now they were
[11:40] Scrolls there was the Torah there was
[11:42] the Old Testament prophets that Paul
[11:44] could read because being studied under
[11:46] Gamaliel he had access to all the old
[11:50] written scripture but there was no
[11:52] Matthew Mark Luke John acts Romans
[11:56] Galatians Ephesians none of that was
[11:58] written so they possibly go back and say
[12:00] well these men are reading the Bible and
[12:03] getting untruth no they kind of entry
[12:05] straight from the devil right listening
[12:08] to what Paul said our Peter our John are
[12:14] all the ones that spoke truth in that
[12:16] time because listen truth has to be
[12:18] presented to you listen to me truth has
[12:22] to be presented to you if trick if non
[12:24] truth is presented to you you're gonna
[12:26] believe that is true right I mean you
[12:30] come to a Trinitarian religion now that
[12:36] wasn't true that all but you held it
[12:38] this truth because what happened is that
[12:41] demon and it's a demon suppress the
[12:46] truth back in the first church a second
[12:49] Serge's third dress why these seals are
[12:51] so important I was thinking this morning
[12:53] and I'll get it one at this afternoon
[12:55] the seals are for you they're for you
[13:01] personally I hope every time I tell you
[13:02] that we're brother branham said it's not
[13:04] for you it's not gone from you it's not
[13:06] even for you people that are sitting
[13:08] there not
[13:09] 63 in other words is for a group of
[13:11] people does not even sit in this room
[13:13] which most of us was three years old in
[13:17] 1963 some of you were older so maybe
[13:19] we're gleaming a moment that is up but
[13:21] we weren't later now we're here the
[13:26] Spirit is here to anoint two people the
[13:31] right people for the right time and the
[13:34] right place and that's what I'm
[13:36] contending that right now the people are
[13:39] on the earth that needs to be on the
[13:40] earth to take a body changes it's never
[13:43] been before that's basically the same
[13:49] thing basically the same thing because
[13:52] this suppressed entreated is that let's
[13:56] take for example even Martin Luther
[13:58] Martin Luther read the just shall live
[14:00] by faith
[14:01] Martin Luther read the Torah which said
[14:05] there's only one God
[14:06] behold o Israel your God is free no he's
[14:10] the bill deliver you've got one
[14:12] but now Martin Luther anointed by a
[14:15] demon sorry which can't be anointed by
[14:18] God and tell a lie he was anointed by a
[14:22] devil on his spirit round not his soul
[14:25] this spirit realm to teach at ranat
[14:28] Aryan doctrine that's my brother Brown
[14:30] said and I read it to you the other side
[14:32] he's a Trinitarian doctrine come from
[14:33] hell
[14:34] it did not come from heaven so who's in
[14:37] hell the devil so it comes from the
[14:40] devil all right that's one a weed that's
[14:43] why I like to now as we're bringing the
[14:47] seals out to see more that we like I
[14:49] said compartmentalize and I think that's
[14:51] what Paul's doing he's compartment life
[14:53] and he said okay the soul is fine
[14:55] we are working this spirit room Oh
[14:57] wretched man that I am always saying o
[14:58] wretched man I am in his soul
[15:01] that thing inside of him was the Holy
[15:04] Ghost that was a prophetic gift he had
[15:07] but what was he talking about he's
[15:09] talking about the middle man the spirit
[15:10] realm the memories and constant
[15:12] affection imagination and remember one
[15:15] more time this thing does not sin it's a
[15:19] fifteen and will manifest in but you
[15:23] don't sin with your buddy you wanna give
[15:26] you a quote the Bible said Jesus said
[15:29] now before Jesus came if a priest
[15:34] preacher whatever were to touch a woman
[15:38] and then how an act with her he
[15:41] committed adultery and they killed him
[15:42] right Jesus comes up and says I say unto
[15:46] you now was he saying not in your flesh
[15:50] in your spirit realm you lust after a
[15:55] woman right you already know your flesh
[15:57] never done it so you plate you know what
[16:01] I'm saying take the flats out of the way
[16:02] it's that spirit realm that we are
[16:05] contacted both from Dawn and from the
[16:07] devil that's our problem that we need to
[16:10] work on and I believe that's why the
[16:11] sealed opening up to me that's the
[16:13] thunder the thunders telling them saying
[16:15] we're boring in our soul it's just as
[16:17] perfect as dotty if Paul is not saying
[16:19] he's lost Polly puddled a born-again
[16:23] believer but he's still saying the
[16:26] things I would not I do think I do and I
[16:29] know that's not with this guy that was
[16:30] what the inner man doesn't listen this
[16:32] is only motivated by what you think
[16:35] we're all adults here you know they say
[16:37] the biggest sex organ is your brain
[16:39] right well that's not your flesh is your
[16:43] brain your brain is what's your problem
[16:44] in your body holding wraps because it's
[16:46] connected to them to the brain
[16:48] right but that soul of man si si so
[16:54] special that we know that the souls born
[16:57] again is untouchable this is finished
[17:01] it's over that Genesis 1:26 man that I
[17:03] love so much that man is now empowering
[17:06] we can sit here and not be like Martin
[17:09] Luther and let's say to run through a
[17:11] filter but God said okay you're gonna
[17:14] preach suggest you live by faith I'm
[17:17] gonna put my stamp of approval on that
[17:19] and that's what you're gonna preach
[17:20] because Jesus I mean God deliver you
[17:23] want to say never put his approve
[17:25] and often he never put us approval on an
[17:29] eternal hell
[17:30] all right that's why we're compartmental
[17:32] I will move these things out of the way
[17:34] and just let this hone in on the
[17:36] spiritual man because you got to read
[17:39] the Bible if the Bible's written to
[17:40] Christians you can't say that we are
[17:43] still mongers and Liars and
[17:46] remembering when we read that the other
[17:47] day in Galatians I believe it it man he
[17:50] got us all he said says for some of you
[17:54] but you're washed your sanctified and
[18:02] what you're just as righteous as God is
[18:05] in your soul and what's going to happen
[18:09] one day is we're going to realize that
[18:11] that thing can't be can't stay in there
[18:13] it's gonna work its way on out it and
[18:17] the Holy Ghost
[18:19] well I didn't bring the quote with this
[18:20] Sunday by will next Sunday but I said
[18:23] we'll fill every fiber of your being
[18:25] well now you have a distance fiber so
[18:28] the Holy Ghost is gonna have to fill
[18:29] this thing this thing that mom and dad
[18:31] brought on the earth is dying you know
[18:34] getting worse going to the doctor and
[18:36] all these things that's not your soul
[18:38] person that's just the body that has was
[18:41] born in sin the product of sin but we
[18:45] have to deny that that's got to be
[18:47] denied and we got to go on with God but
[18:53] the wrath of God is revealed from heaven
[18:54] against all ungodliness and
[18:55] unrighteousness of men who hold the
[18:58] truth in unrighteousness because that
[19:00] which may be known of God is manifest in
[19:03] them for God hath showed it to them
[19:05] nowhere got shown them the truth now to
[19:07] me see there's that mystery of iniquity
[19:10] because iniquity is what knowing to do
[19:13] good and don't do it or knowing not to
[19:16] do it and you do it anyway alright cuz
[19:19] look realize this there is no false
[19:22] doctrine ever come from God so these
[19:25] preachers in the message reads they're
[19:26] preaching these things that are their
[19:28] faults that didn't come from God I don't
[19:30] care if they raised 25 million dead
[19:31] people I really don't care
[19:34] doesn't bother me but if he'll point me
[19:36] to the right word of God and what will
[19:38] what he says will ring true with me than
[19:41] Amen whatever he does but now if he
[19:44] takes me to another god I don't care if
[19:47] you have signs and wonders I really
[19:48] don't they don't bother me one bit but
[19:52] now people in the message is just it's
[19:53] just we're just they're just waiting you
[19:55] just watch I'm dead that's a long time
[19:57] you just wait there's no man in this
[19:59] message is going to jump up now signs
[20:01] and wonders and healing but you'll take
[20:03] them away from you line you watch them
[20:05] say go that's what people wait know what
[20:08] where to sign what does this pledge
[20:09] thing is what gets all excited yeah
[20:13] but remember it's a soul's right
[20:17] somewhere you'll all align backed up now
[20:20] you might get off a little bit sure
[20:21] enough honestly you can get off a little
[20:23] bit we've had things in our mind that we
[20:24] thought out that we thought was right
[20:26] and the preacher come along and preached
[20:27] that it wasn't and what it lines
[20:29] everything right back out that doesn't
[20:31] make us lost but if we would have denied
[20:34] the truth that's what these through
[20:35] they've denied the truth they hold the
[20:37] truth and they deny telling it to the
[20:38] people
[20:39] we'll see Paul's already seen that and
[20:41] that's that while horse rider this
[20:43] attacks just up to the church then we go
[20:48] to read then we go we'll talk about the
[20:50] black horse this afternoon because that
[20:53] was made known to God Memphis okay for
[20:55] the invisible thing this is what I like
[20:57] I like this right here but I go back to
[21:01] the quote where brother Brown said that
[21:04] the most illiterate person can get born
[21:06] again it's not because you're education
[21:08] that's not that you can read and it's
[21:10] not that you can understand all the
[21:11] fields and the plays at the bottom it's
[21:14] believed one of the Lord Jesus Christ
[21:15] enough that they say but watch is for
[21:17] the invisible things of him from the
[21:18] creation of the world are clearly seen
[21:20] what being understood by the things that
[21:25] are made want us to about us even his
[21:30] eternal power and Godhead that they are
[21:32] without excuse my living reason what it
[21:35] says in them in degree that's number 20
[21:40] for the invisible things even his
[21:43] eternal power and deity since to create
[21:46] the world are clearly seen being
[21:49] perceived by the things which are made
[21:52] so that they are in excusable so here we
[21:58] go an illiterate man that can't even
[22:01] read but anybody with one I have sense
[22:05] the immense them knows that we were born
[22:07] in some bad condition because we're
[22:11] dying we have these evil thoughts we do
[22:14] these evil things right so you take a
[22:16] man who can't even read but he stepped
[22:18] on his porch one day and he hears one
[22:20] somebody a Christian her life has to
[22:23] come through the body he hears a
[22:24] Christian talking about something
[22:26] different than what he's talking okay
[22:30] and so now that illiterate person can
[22:32] say okay I want what you got
[22:36] what's that person gonna do that person
[22:38] that you don't even have to take you
[22:39] back to the Bible and let that show
[22:42] weakness did you take in the Bible but I
[22:43] don't have to take people to the Bible
[22:45] right tell them how brother Graham
[22:47] didn't say tell him how to read the
[22:48] Bible used to tell them how your fire
[22:50] got lit your fire got Lee know how you
[22:53] got to come where your aspect then you
[22:56] can think into the Bible maybe didn't
[22:58] but when a literate person could see
[23:00] Godhead the Godhead can be explained by
[23:04] just being a human being of course we
[23:07] are
[23:07] we are finite he's in finite but even
[23:11] being finite I'm a father I'm a son a
[23:15] minister a human husband I got 20
[23:19] different titles but I'm one person to
[23:23] my grandbaby when she walks up then I
[23:25] become a granddad to her I don't treat
[23:27] her like a lot I treated like a granddad
[23:30] so I've got these attributes in the same
[23:32] way I sway the Godhead the guy that can
[23:36] be explained by what but understood by
[23:39] the things that are made because God
[23:41] didn't create us Sonny creates to be
[23:43] different he created he created Adam and
[23:46] Eve perfect and then and then Satan
[23:52] comes into what not into
[23:55] flesh and I don't still had all the
[23:59] working parts before then they just
[24:02] brother Brent said he had the Holy Ghost
[24:03] bail over his wife mine his mind had a
[24:07] Holy Ghost bail over nine his body his
[24:09] mine so what did Adam do when he stepped
[24:13] out into that middle realm that memories
[24:16] and conservation imagination because
[24:18] that affections not affection to going V
[24:22] Leo love has no affection to God yes
[24:24] right called is totally contrary it is
[24:27] it's totally country do you think about
[24:28] figlio will have it's contrary to God
[24:30] it's already closed it causes us to do
[24:33] what we do procreation and all these
[24:35] things that's not of God is permitted if
[24:39] nothing wrong with it if it's done right
[24:41] but from that realm it can be done wrong
[24:43] so he steps out into that realm so what
[24:46] Adam do I'm still well I gotta do
[24:47] something trying to step out in that
[24:49] spirit realm yeah dude till he sold us
[24:53] out he didn't sell us out in that in his
[24:55] soul he sold us out in this in his bare
[24:57] ground then what his body reacted to
[25:02] what he was thinking that he'd never
[25:03] felt those thoughts before and his body
[25:05] reacted he did what he did so to me it's
[25:07] very simple when you take those three
[25:09] and really we preach body spirit and
[25:11] soul for years but we really never
[25:14] compartmentalize and said okay if the
[25:16] soul is born again move it out of the
[25:18] way you can't perfect perfection
[25:25] because if you're born again I'm telling
[25:27] you we're going to preach on that one
[25:29] day about the power that lays inside of
[25:30] you because the Holy Ghost inside of you
[25:32] is perfect
[25:33] never send a day in its life never had a
[25:36] false doctrine never had a pulse
[25:38] 'are there any error in its life but
[25:41] remember if there's one thing held
[25:42] against you God can take you together so
[25:46] if you're going again that soul that's
[25:48] why those who he has justified if you
[25:50] keep on going
[25:51] he is already glorified all right so
[25:55] that's in the that's in the soul of man
[25:57] but the spirit realm
[26:00] remember it's where remember God took
[26:03] the heart Satan took the where's your
[26:07] memory come from where's your reasoning
[26:09] come from where did your conscience come
[26:11] from where did your faxing come from
[26:14] where's your imagination come from okay
[26:18] but through to that though being born
[26:20] again though we are turned and that's
[26:23] what Paul is talking about these men are
[26:25] not doing it watch but we're going to
[26:27] watch and see what happens real quick
[26:28] before we go to get finished with this
[26:30] because they took the truth and held it
[26:33] in unrighteousness and this is what
[26:35] happened that's why you'll see you will
[26:38] see and you can look back and brother
[26:42] let me tell you many things being in the
[26:46] message almost 60 years then any false
[26:49] doctrine if you stay in that false
[26:51] doctrine it leads you into a well let's
[26:57] just say one Fox talking about though
[26:59] the plant another seed
[27:01] well this preacher finally plants the
[27:04] seed in them eighteen year old girl you
[27:07] know truth right
[27:10] because of its doctrine Guardian tell
[27:13] him to do that you see so what happens
[27:17] then they're holding the tree watch what
[27:20] happens when you hold the truth in
[27:21] unrighteousness let's read you know what
[27:23] goes Paul already saw this what because
[27:27] he's telling it they are no excuse that
[27:29] we are to see anything but one God see
[27:33] anything but the purity of the gospel
[27:36] and even his eternal power and Godhead
[27:38] so that they are without excuse because
[27:40] that when they knew God now that new is
[27:47] not new like Adam knew his wife right
[27:49] because when you know God in that way
[27:52] when you have an intimate relationship
[27:53] that's when you go into that holy of
[27:56] holies and you you're going in in your
[27:57] soul those people never did because that
[27:59] when they knew God they glorified him
[28:02] not as God neither we're thankful but
[28:06] became vain in their own imagination and
[28:10] their foolish heart was darkened that's
[28:16] what we're going to talk about today
[28:17] that's why I said Paul is preaching the
[28:18] steals we just he didn't know what to
[28:21] call them now we know what call them
[28:23] looking back we can see because we're
[28:25] looking at today we're looking at the
[28:26] dark horse the black horse and it's not
[28:29] so much physical death but they're
[28:32] killing these people spiritually
[28:35] spiritual Destin's way worse than
[28:37] physical death right because you're
[28:39] alive
[28:40] the Bible says she is what she's what
[28:42] alive but she's dead while she's living
[28:45] right and she's the church I'm not
[28:48] talking like the women I'm coming when I
[28:50] say she knows I'm at the church they
[28:52] include all most men included we are the
[28:54] church
[28:59] yeah but what they took was that they
[29:02] took that letter though and they ran it
[29:04] through a filter they became fools he's
[29:10] going to tell you exactly what's going
[29:11] to happen to watch excuse me because
[29:14] what happens you take the desire in your
[29:18] heart and you don't put God in there the
[29:22] devil is going to watch this is what the
[29:24] devil is going to do for you and we see
[29:25] this more in this day than it wasn't in
[29:27] back then professing themselves to be
[29:29] wise they became fools
[29:31] now think of all the false doctrine
[29:33] that's been in the message and how they
[29:35] went off on polygamy and adultery and
[29:38] all these different always leaked why
[29:40] because that soul is not anchored in the
[29:42] word amen so the real person shows up
[29:47] and manifest through the flesh look and
[29:50] change the glory of the uncorruptible
[29:53] God into an image made like to
[29:56] corruptible man in other words image are
[29:58] a Idol Birds four-footed beasts and
[30:01] creeping things wherefore God also gave
[30:05] them up to uncleanness through the lusts
[30:07] of their own hearts to dishonour their
[30:11] own bodies between themselves look who
[30:17] changed the truth of God into a lie
[30:22] hmm about that let me read it in the
[30:25] original who exchanged the truth
[30:28] concerning God for a false religion and
[30:33] reverence and served the creature rather
[30:37] than the Creator who is worthy of praise
[30:40] to the ages amen to change the truth God
[30:44] into a lie and worshipped and served the
[30:47] creature in oil into flesh more than the
[30:52] Creator who is blessed forever amen for
[30:53] this call God gave them up until vile
[30:57] affection for even their women did
[31:00] the natural use into what should against
[31:01] nature we know that idea that played an
[31:03] ism all right because remember people
[31:08] what they manifested equal won't we
[31:10] mount offense when brother branham saw
[31:12] that one brother remember he discerned
[31:14] that he was committing adultery right he
[31:18] went to the brother and then what God
[31:20] revealed the brother branham that that
[31:21] was a demon that he was messin with
[31:23] organized religion which was the same
[31:26] devil it was the same spiritual devil
[31:30] that was that they because what is what
[31:34] is a denominational idea against the
[31:36] Word of God is committing spiritual
[31:38] fornication because what you're doing is
[31:41] you're saying you're making love to God
[31:43] and you're actually making love to the
[31:45] devil and they're right man so what
[31:50] happens to that though that demon says
[31:52] I'm not going to stay there I want to
[31:53] come out and I'm gonna manifest it in
[31:56] the body yes right good watch
[31:58] and likewise also the men leaving the
[32:01] natural use of the woman
[32:03] Paul picked that spirit up he picked it
[32:06] up and knew what was happening burned in
[32:08] their lust one toward another men with
[32:10] men working that which is unseemly and
[32:13] receiving in themselves that recompence
[32:16] of their error which was me and even as
[32:19] they did not like to retain God in their
[32:21] knowledge God gave them over to a
[32:25] reprobate mind in other words God knew
[32:26] they were going to continue to do it he
[32:28] said all right go ahead because he knew
[32:32] they would change see we always have
[32:33] hoped but he knew they were gonna change
[32:35] so he just said okay go ahead believe
[32:37] what you wanted to do those things which
[32:39] are not convenient being filled with all
[32:42] that righteousness look where it took to
[32:43] a fornication hang weeding this
[32:45] covetousness maliciousness full of envy
[32:48] murder debate deceit malignity
[32:52] whisperers backbiters haters of god
[32:55] despiteful proud boasters inventors of
[32:57] evil things disobedient to parents we
[33:00] see that now that all comes from let me
[33:04] be plain that all come from a
[33:06] denominational idea
[33:10] till this false doctrine against
[33:11] nightfall doctrine against God doesn't
[33:14] make these people do this but God said
[33:19] okay if you're gonna fill yourself up
[33:20] with something and it's not gonna be me
[33:23] there you go
[33:24] there's your list that's what you're
[33:27] gonna do because what Satan's gonna do
[33:28] he knew what that spirit was gonna do
[33:30] cuz well inventors of evil things this
[33:34] will be the parents without
[33:35] understanding covenantbreakers without
[33:39] natural affection let's see what that
[33:42] would resume implacable it means
[33:50] literally without libation which usually
[33:52] accompanies a treaty truthless truce in
[33:58] other words they have no they have no
[34:03] hmm when God you know he gave what's the
[34:08] word I'm trying the same you know
[34:10] where's he give him covenants he gave us
[34:12] all covenants he gave his promises and
[34:13] things he just pulled them right out
[34:15] from under that promise collective three
[34:17] electric break the tree yeah doctors
[34:19] breakers unmerciful who knowing the
[34:22] judgment of God that they which commit
[34:26] such things now see he's talking about
[34:27] he's not talking about well I guess it
[34:32] leads you to that but when Paul talks
[34:34] about these people say you've got that's
[34:36] why I'd like to get in Paul's head
[34:38] Paul was seeing this with his own eyes
[34:41] then if you turn God away
[34:43] if you turn got away and try and start
[34:47] doing your unrighteousness I see these
[34:50] people that were once in church or that
[34:52] were once my friends or that was once my
[34:54] acquaintances this is now what they're
[34:57] doing so what he's saying is so God's
[35:00] going to give them a reprobate mind and
[35:01] turn them over to all these things on
[35:03] him who knowing the judgment of God that
[35:06] they which commit such things are worthy
[35:08] of death not only do the same but have
[35:13] pleasure in them that do them I know
[35:17] words they associate with each other
[35:18] and you see that version was better
[35:21] thought together you know we don't you
[35:23] know I have pleasure with being here I'm
[35:27] on my brothers and sisters I use that
[35:29] pleasure of a places a man everybody
[35:31] outside we have we just had pleasure
[35:33] other places well that's what I'm saying
[35:40] that these people watch went to church
[35:42] these are not just people that grow up
[35:44] drunkards murderers whoremongers
[35:46] fornicator now they were once in truth
[35:48] because they took the truth of God and
[35:51] made it a righteousness remember these
[35:54] people hold the truth and look when they
[35:57] hold another righteousness you see what
[35:59] happened nothing you see it happen even
[36:01] in a nominal world you see people these
[36:04] people come in or don't be that's not a
[36:05] good you know that but why do they do it
[36:08] because they hold the truth of God and
[36:10] unrighteousness that's why that the
[36:12] breaking of these seals moves all that
[36:16] out of the way seems right and we no
[36:19] worries right we know what he's doing
[36:21] with it
[36:22] we know his tactic now brother Brown
[36:24] said one time he said we now have seen
[36:27] his excellent they did not have Satan's
[36:29] answer in Martin Luther's day they
[36:32] didn't have in Wesley state they did not
[36:36] have Satan century in the Pentecostal
[36:40] day they did not have all of Satan's
[36:42] answers but today because you know what
[36:45] there's only one question there's only
[36:47] one question left
[36:49] can we get this thing changed that's all
[36:52] everything else is done except this we
[36:56] got to get this thing changed that's it
[36:57] well actually we're preaching the
[37:00] resurrection I was thinking the other
[37:01] day in a resurrection gonna come before
[37:03] we change right but we are preaching the
[37:06] resurrection now cuz once we get all
[37:09] this deadness out of the way then the
[37:11] dead that we're in Christ they're in
[37:14] another dimension or gonna walk over
[37:15] into this dimensions then we which are
[37:18] alive and remain shall be changed right
[37:21] so we're preaching I think we're
[37:23] preaching the preaching the resurrection
[37:25] message now and then we're gonna do I
[37:29] believe we're preaching the resurrection
[37:29] message now and then one day the dad's
[37:32] gonna just come among us that's right
[37:34] and then we go know then get all whole
[37:38] hell fix the break loose out there so
[37:39] I'm not worried about them I'm not
[37:41] worried about that
[37:42] but you know the poro 144,000 they're
[37:45] waiting on us
[37:47] no way no nuts they're over there into
[37:49] Israel been looking for what two
[37:51] thousand year while they've been looking
[37:52] for four thousand years for the Messiah
[37:54] being here the whole time
[37:56] and then finally their eyes are going to
[37:58] be open and we'll see that when we go on
[38:00] into the fifth seal in the sixth seal
[38:02] we're gonna see that Israel eyes are
[38:04] open but the fifth and sixth seal is
[38:06] gonna make our eyes like I said last
[38:10] Sunday God's got to get into the womb of
[38:13] our mind something that nobody on the
[38:15] face of this earth has ever faced
[38:18] he is a body change without dead you
[38:21] think you know I don't know in his way
[38:22] back in okay I'll I just by gonna I
[38:25] don't know about us today even jesus
[38:27] said that a man but he died so that we
[38:30] could live all right he died that we
[38:33] could change our body are not the
[38:35] stranger body but we do have something
[38:37] to do with money tank you can either
[38:39] reject it or exactly mister new you sit
[38:41] here and you know wear long dresses and
[38:43] long hair and go to a message church but
[38:44] you can I'm going to help in there right
[38:47] all right all right or bless you right
[38:50] for nothing
[38:56] he'll do the job I'm sure
