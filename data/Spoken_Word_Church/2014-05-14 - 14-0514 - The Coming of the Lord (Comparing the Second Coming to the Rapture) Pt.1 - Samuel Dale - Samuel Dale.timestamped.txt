[32:53] second or the coming of the Lord and uh
[32:56] you know dealing with the second coming
[32:59] more because of it being where we're at
[33:02] but I want to be talking about the
[33:03] coming of the Lord and uh you know but
[33:05] what I want to do tonight is I want to
[33:08] kind of take what we've been saying
[33:11] about the
[33:12] Rapture and then just kind of bring it
[33:16] over into looking at the uh coming of
[33:21] the Lord and uh I know that looks like
[33:25] two different things
[33:28] and you know in a way it is but in
[33:29] another way it's not and uh it it looks
[33:32] like to our human thinking that it's not
[33:36] related but I believe it is all right
[33:40] and then see we think and our mind has
[33:42] always been set on one thing that we we
[33:46] uh think of a Rapture as I said we think
[33:49] of a Rapture as something that's going
[33:52] away you know going off going to heaven
[33:56] whatever you want to talk about your uh
[33:59] doings and and all and uh you know we we
[34:03] relate that to the Rapture but then when
[34:06] you talk about the the coming of the
[34:08] Lord see then we we pull that as being
[34:12] coming this way you know all right but I
[34:17] believe that they are are
[34:21] um closely related to one
[34:24] another and you know in doings and and
[34:27] in that I want to to try to just show
[34:30] that tonight as a part and maybe not
[34:33] read a whole lot but just deal with that
[34:36] part because what do we found out about
[34:38] the
[34:40] Rapture see the Rapture is actually not
[34:43] going
[34:45] up as we think that's a finishing of it
[34:50] that's a completion of what we talk
[34:53] about the word rapture that not being in
[34:55] the Bible but it means caught up you
[34:58] know there in Thessalonians all but it's
[35:01] you know looking at it that we know for
[35:05] short that really all three stages of
[35:09] the Rapture takes place here on
[35:14] Earth then we're
[35:17] changed all right now I've been through
[35:20] that and over it and on all and trying
[35:22] to show it with Corinthians and
[35:24] Thessalonians and things but I hope
[35:27] you've you're understanding me because
[35:30] you know to look at it from what the
[35:34] prophet he said that Jesus does all
[35:36] three of these things in his
[35:41] descending well descending then relates
[35:44] to coming this
[35:46] way all right and as I said then we've
[35:50] been through it to prove that the
[35:52] prophet didn't cover it in the
[35:53] scriptures that see we we're going to
[35:55] have to be here we're going to have to
[35:58] be the dead is going to have to
[36:00] raise all right so that would be we know
[36:03] the message is already went forth which
[36:05] is the shout the Lord himself sent from
[36:08] heav with a shout voice of an archangel
[36:10] all right and we know the voice of the
[36:12] Archangel is the same voice that raised
[36:15] Lazarus and that would be the Lord Jesus
[36:17] Christ here among us to raise the dead
[36:21] you know so the Dead's going to raise
[36:23] before we go that way and see we're
[36:26] actually going to be changed right here
[36:29] we're not going up in the sky somewhere
[36:32] and then be changed it's all transpiring
[36:35] here amen all right and my whole point
[36:39] has been to try to get us to to quit
[36:42] looking at you know well one of these
[36:44] days Rapture is going to take place and
[36:46] they've argued in the message that we're
[36:48] in the Rapture and the Rapture is in us
[36:50] and all this that and the other ever
[36:52] since we've been in the
[36:54] message but I believe that I proved my
[36:57] point what I was talking
[36:59] about
[37:01] that if the shout is here which is the
[37:05] message then that shout would be the
[37:07] voice of the Archangel which would be
[37:10] Christ here all right then here's where
[37:14] we're going to be when the dead are
[37:17] raised all right and then we're
[37:22] changed and then we go
[37:24] away all right so that
[37:28] that way see then we don't have to look
[37:29] at it as as
[37:31] something uh to
[37:33] [Music]
[37:35] come we look at it as I've been trying
[37:38] to cover that it's already in a
[37:40] process and I told you where I believe
[37:43] it started I believe the process started
[37:47] in the New
[37:49] Birth when you were born again your soul
[37:52] was resurrected sitting in Heavenly
[37:54] places all right so then the Rapture has
[37:58] been in process for quite a
[38:01] time they are things that are not
[38:04] complete yet
[38:07] sure all right so is it when we get into
[38:09] the coming of the Lord that a lot of the
[38:12] coming of the Lord is already
[38:15] transpired but we're looking for it to
[38:18] come when it's already
[38:20] transpired all but now there are things
[38:24] that are not completely transpired yet
[38:27] we're still
[38:28] here you know we we know that for a
[38:31] certainty right now think about what
[38:35] then my point of what I'm trying to do
[38:38] is to
[38:40] compare or show or you know bring out
[38:44] into the open or into view to
[38:48] us that if the Rapture has
[38:52] already started in a
[38:55] process you know
[38:58] then why are we looking toward the
[39:02] heavens come on brother instead of
[39:05] looking to where we're at amen and you
[39:08] remember we kept emphasizing that you
[39:11] know the prophet said the great problem
[39:14] was what looking back to what had been
[39:18] looking forward to what will be and
[39:21] failing to see what's going on now and
[39:24] that way then we can deal with Hebrews
[39:26] 13
[39:28] eight that he's the same yesterday today
[39:31] and forever all right see now the
[39:33] scripture should be coming
[39:35] alive to each and every one of us all
[39:39] right so now if Jesus according to
[39:42] paragraph 129 130 of the
[39:44] Rapture brother bandam says that Jesus
[39:47] does all three of these when he's
[39:52] descending all
[39:54] right now
[39:58] if that's
[40:00] true as I said why do we look so far
[40:06] away you know
[40:09] amen why are we longing
[40:13] for
[40:17] heaven when I thought we believed
[40:20] everything was coming this way
[40:23] amen I I thought we even believe that
[40:26] the future home was going to come down
[40:28] here
[40:30] amen and now I don't mean this is a joke
[40:33] and I don't mean it is sarcastic or I
[40:35] just mean it is truth why don't we want
[40:38] to stay here come on brother well we're
[40:42] getting old wor out so
[40:46] what so
[40:49] what what do that got to do with it
[40:52] we're good children of
[40:54] Abraham right 25 years it got worse and
[40:59] worse and worse and worse and worse and
[41:01] worse and he still kept
[41:05] confessing all
[41:07] right now the prophet said paragraph
[41:10] 6566 with the Rapture a Rapture is a
[41:16] revelation right and he said the bride
[41:19] would be waiting for the revelation of
[41:22] the Rapture
[41:24] amen so now we're not going to be up in
[41:27] Heaven waiting on a
[41:31] revelation right I mean here's where the
[41:35] Revelation
[41:36] comes well and I told you many many
[41:39] years ago I quit trying to go to heaven
[41:41] a long time
[41:43] ago because I found out everything's
[41:46] coming this
[41:47] way well why do I want to go up there
[41:50] brother brand there about 60 somewhere
[41:54] right in there he's talking about uh
[41:56] silence in heaven he said see there
[41:58] ain't nothing up
[42:01] there well you want to go up there where
[42:04] all the silence is that I want to be
[42:06] down here where the joys going
[42:09] on but I'm trying to get us to see the
[42:13] reality of what's taking place
[42:18] now and quit looking off out
[42:22] D and start talking about what's here
[42:26] right
[42:29] that's my whole point for 3 or 4 months
[42:31] now it's been my whole point for 45
[42:34] years really is to try to get us out of
[42:37] so Heavenly
[42:38] yeah somebody come along boy they preach
[42:41] a good message about the Heavenly and
[42:43] the glory and and you just feel so good
[42:46] and and I do too and you know but then
[42:48] when it's all over with I come find out
[42:50] I'm still
[42:54] here well I like something that you
[42:59] know that I can think about for a few
[43:02] days don't you I like for somebody to
[43:05] stir me up in the point in the word that
[43:09] that tomorrow I've got something to
[43:11] think
[43:14] about well if it's a way up
[43:18] yonder you
[43:20] know I might as well wait till I get up
[43:25] yonder but if I I can realize that
[43:28] something is taking place
[43:31] amen all right now I've tried to prove
[43:34] the point and been through it what age
[43:36] what time what doings that have you ever
[43:40] had that a people are supposed to be to
[43:43] the point of what I'm talking about
[43:46] because even in the Apostle Paul he says
[43:49] there's going to be you remember the
[43:54] prophecy how the Bible is the prophecy
[43:56] until
[43:57] revealed and Paul would say there's
[44:00] going to be a falling
[44:04] away he was speaking now may I quote
[44:07] brother random he said Paul was trying
[44:10] to get it out of their
[44:12] mind that another words paraphrasing
[44:15] because it's maybe not the wording he
[44:16] used but it's very close they were
[44:18] trying to get it out of their
[44:20] minds that the Rapture is coming right
[44:25] then when we all thought he was trying
[44:29] to get it in the mind that it was
[44:32] coming but he knew that'd be almost
[44:34] 2,000
[44:37] years remember he saw
[44:42] it wouldn't it be something you sit in a
[44:44] meeting and Paul says look you don't
[44:47] parfor get out of our language today
[44:50] when to come out here and say y'all quit
[44:52] trying to go to
[44:54] heaven y'all y'all just quit trying to
[44:56] go to
[44:57] Heaven settle down quit trying to go to
[45:00] heaven CU it's going to be 2,000
[45:04] years well you wouldn't call that much
[45:07] of a
[45:09] Preacher come on am I
[45:11] right well know what kind of a guy are
[45:14] you you you're you're a putter offer
[45:17] somewhere well that's what Paul was
[45:20] doing he's saying it can't come until
[45:23] they come a falling away well now if you
[45:26] can't can't see that in the past few
[45:30] years there has been a drastic Falling
[45:34] Away of the people of this
[45:37] message the 77 wasn't no problem there
[45:41] was a few churches sent their books back
[45:44] but now the preachers are jumping out of
[45:47] the message and trying to jump on some
[45:49] other bandwagon I guess but I don't
[45:52] think they're going to quit preaching
[45:53] all totally although I would admire some
[45:55] of them that did
[45:59] you know I was telling brother dickness
[46:00] we talking about a while ago I
[46:02] appreciate some of these preachers
[46:04] that's got enough gumption to just sit
[46:06] down and
[46:08] quit you know just get
[46:12] out quit trying to claim the message the
[46:16] problems is the ones that are sitting in
[46:17] it because if you're out of the message
[46:19] and gone you can't be the one Jesus
[46:22] spoke of that you stand in the door and
[46:24] won't go in and won't let nobody else go
[46:27] in
[46:28] right all
[46:31] right but see what have I been driving
[46:33] at for the
[46:34] longest recognizing your day in its
[46:40] message all right we've had the
[46:42] prophet's message we recognize that I
[46:44] hope we're not recognizing somebody else
[46:46] to come you know what I mean there's got
[46:50] to be somebody coming along straighten
[46:51] this thing out cuz brother around messed
[46:52] it all up I sure hope that's not what
[46:54] you're looking for
[46:58] if it is I'd go home and forget
[47:02] it but the thing of it is trying to get
[47:06] people to see things
[47:09] personal Luther recognized his day
[47:12] Wesley recognized his day Pentecost
[47:14] recognized their day brother random
[47:17] recognized his day when are we going to
[47:22] recognize the hour that we're living
[47:26] amen
[47:30] and to see that's Reon I'm trying to
[47:32] bring these things out like
[47:36] this well one of these days or one of
[47:39] these days we're going to go in the
[47:41] Rapture well how are you going to go in
[47:43] the Rapture if you had heard the shout
[47:45] that's right right now come
[47:48] on I know I'm hard but now you tell me
[47:52] the rest of the world's going into
[47:54] Rapture when we go into Rapture I'm
[47:56] going to tell you you ain't
[47:57] going because there's something wrong
[48:00] with your
[48:02] thinking
[48:04] right you mean just a bus is going to
[48:06] pull up and everybody's going to climb
[48:09] on you know this church over here is
[48:11] going to we're all
[48:13] going well that's what you're saying
[48:16] unless you're trying to see something
[48:17] personal related to you right that they
[48:21] can't see come on yes
[48:24] sir that's all I've tried to say
[48:27] something the world can't
[48:30] see and something the biggest portion of
[48:32] people this message can't even
[48:36] see oh yeah that make go woman going to
[48:39] get in the White House po come out of
[48:41] the United
[48:44] States well we ready to go
[48:49] now but listen
[48:53] church if the Rapture is a revelation
[48:57] then you and I have got to be at a the
[49:00] right place to get that
[49:02] Revelation that's
[49:05] right all
[49:07] right now to do that then I believe we
[49:12] must have the message that has been
[49:16] brought to us revealed unto us as to the
[49:21] amount that we have to have now we know
[49:23] that there's degrees and there's
[49:25] different things and all but still it's
[49:28] our part my little bitty part you know
[49:31] your your little toenail you know it
[49:34] it's just as valuable as your your uh
[49:38] brain because it's protecting your
[49:41] toe you know it's doing its part it was
[49:46] put there I don't want them taking Parts
[49:49] out of me just because they say I don't
[49:50] need them they would put there for some
[49:54] reason all right leave them alone
[49:57] home you know but think about
[50:02] it see then the Rapture is a
[50:10] revelation
[50:12] now listen to this thought and you'll
[50:14] get my
[50:18] point what if the Rapture is a
[50:25] revelation of his
[50:34] coming I give you a little time to think
[50:36] on that
[50:39] right what if the Rapture that we know
[50:42] that's
[50:44] already in
[50:47] process of the message that we've heard
[50:50] that's the shout and in that message is
[50:53] the voice of the archangel
[50:58] what if
[51:00] that
[51:02] Revelation is the coming of the
[51:07] Lord you know brother random made a
[51:10] statement I'll get to these way on down
[51:11] the road
[51:13] somewhere he talks about the seventh
[51:15] seal being his
[51:22] coming and about 1982 somewhere in in
[51:26] there I tried to preach those seals and
[51:29] when I come down to the end and bringing
[51:30] it
[51:31] down I said you know what people are
[51:34] looking for some great big something to
[51:40] happen but I said what if it
[51:42] is that it would be a message so
[51:47] simple until the people would miss
[51:51] it now brother Brown said if we don't
[51:53] get these minor things he said the major
[51:57] things is not coming all right now you
[51:59] know I what I've taught you that I
[52:01] believe if we don't follow the message
[52:03] how are we going to know where to look
[52:06] because it's this prophet's message
[52:08] right that is going to change
[52:11] us even the Jews talking listen to that
[52:15] Rabbi or not talking listen to Rabbi
[52:16] Richmond believe it was one or gersam
[52:19] Solomon they believe that Elijah will
[52:22] come and show them where to rebuild the
[52:26] Temple
[52:29] they're looking for the coming of Elijah
[52:31] to precede the
[52:37] Messiah what about it
[52:40] Church could we s be sitting in the
[52:43] greatest of event that has ever
[52:45] transpired in the
[52:48] world that would be the coming of the
[52:53] Lord and the going away of the church
[53:01] and knowing that a lot of that has
[53:03] already
[53:06] transpired but yeah we're looking for
[53:11] it you know we're trying to find
[53:15] it
[53:19] right and the Bible talks about
[53:21] stumbling at The Stumbling
[53:24] Stone you know how I illustr at that you
[53:27] got a football feel that there's not a
[53:29] rock in the whole place what is it 100
[53:31] yards is at the distance and 50 yard
[53:34] wide orever what it is you know and all
[53:36] that grounded this green grass and right
[53:39] out in the middle of it Danny there's a
[53:42] rock and everybody on the place is
[53:45] looking for
[53:48] it and somebody just stumbles and fall
[53:51] so who tripped me don't even know he's
[53:54] the thing that he's looking for that's
[53:56] right
[53:59] that's right what about it
[54:03] Church you see how easy it would be to
[54:07] miss
[54:10] it thinking we're in
[54:20] it I remember making a statement back
[54:22] then that was so outstandingly simple
[54:27] CU everybody says I'm so deep and this
[54:31] that I wish you'd following this old
[54:33] brain one
[54:35] day
[54:36] but you know the statement I made back
[54:42] there the word
[54:44] come Co me go home look it up in your
[54:47] dictionary when you get
[54:49] home it means to be here
[54:57] to be here I said brother collie come to
[55:01] see
[55:04] me well it might be two weeks before
[55:06] he's coming I don't have anything to do
[55:09] with
[55:10] it I don't have anything to do with it
[55:12] once I've said it to him right am I just
[55:15] get ready for him to come in the
[55:18] house well if he's driving down the
[55:20] highway he's still not
[55:22] there oh there's brother collie he's 18
[55:25] miles down the road I can see him but
[55:28] it's dumb right
[55:31] no it literally
[55:34] means not even to be in his
[55:39] presence it literally means like a
[55:43] husband and a wife becoming one and
[55:50] embracing wouldn't it be something you
[55:52] be overseas and be gone for two or three
[55:54] weeks and come back home you why say hi
[55:55] honey LED you
[55:57] home I mean I didn't expect a kiss
[56:04] anyway or she knows that I'm going to be
[56:08] there at 2:00 and she decides to go to
[56:10] town
[56:15] shopping well he knows where the house
[56:18] is he can get
[56:19] in all
[56:24] right you know when the Lord Jesus Jesus
[56:26] raised from the
[56:28] dead there was a very simple message
[56:31] went
[56:32] out he is
[56:37] risen very very simple message and for
[56:41] 2,000 years we've been trying to figure
[56:43] out all about
[56:45] that you know what it simply meant he's
[56:52] risen well what if the coming of the
[56:54] Lord is truly
[56:56] just the basis of him saying I'm
[57:05] here how simple can it
[57:09] be but yet we stumble all over it trying
[57:13] to find
[57:18] it see then if the Rapture is a
[57:22] revelation and the bride will be waiting
[57:24] for the revelation of the rapture what
[57:26] if that Revelation is so simple that it
[57:29] would be a message that he's
[57:32] here no no Rapture no no Rapture see
[57:36] there's your mind you still up in the
[57:39] clouds
[57:43] right I remember seeing a movie one time
[57:45] I know it's fictitional it was probably
[57:47] true because of the difference in doing
[57:49] it was when they first started testing
[57:51] the jet
[57:52] airplane and and the man run down the
[57:55] runway the pilot did
[57:56] and and he was so you know he was so
[58:00] fast compared to what he used to be till
[58:02] they said when he raised off the ground
[58:04] they said how are you doing he said my
[58:06] mind's still on the
[58:08] runway he said well that was dumb no it
[58:11] was just so
[58:12] fast the man told him said count to
[58:16] 10 he counted 10 he said he said I'm up
[58:19] now it's just a point of what I'm trying
[58:21] to get you to see
[58:28] the last few hours of Jesus hanging on
[58:31] the cross the biggest portion of the Old
[58:34] Testament was
[58:36] fulfilled in the last few hours
[58:40] amen and what are we looking
[58:47] for now let's just compare some things
[58:52] and think about it
[58:59] do you know
[59:00] that when the Lord Jesus was here on
[59:07] Earth he brought a message didn't he
[59:11] right
[59:14] shout brother R couldn't bring anything
[59:16] contrary to that so it had to be the
[59:17] same
[59:22] shout you know the voice of the
[59:24] Archangel was there
[59:28] cuz Lazarus was raised from the
[59:31] dead
[59:32] and Lady what was over nine I believe it
[59:35] is her son was raised in the dead many
[59:38] dead were
[59:40] raised why because he know he knew who
[59:43] he
[59:45] was he had no doubts of who he was
[59:48] Hallelujah that's it he could stand
[59:50] there and say destroy this
[59:52] body right in 3 days I'll raise it
[59:58] up confounded the world with his
[1:00:02] speech but
[1:00:05] remember he had a message was a
[1:00:08] shout and remember he was the voice of
[1:00:11] the
[1:00:15] Archangel and you know after he was
[1:00:17] raised he left a
[1:00:24] message a trumpet a gospel
[1:00:29] trumpet he is
[1:00:32] risen you see how simple it can
[1:00:37] be but but brother Dale you're talking
[1:00:39] about Rapture going away and coming
[1:00:42] coming down I've never talked about that
[1:00:45] I don't know where you getting that
[1:00:50] idea I'm talking about what's here
[1:00:54] now am
[1:01:00] I believe we've heard the message don't
[1:01:02] you we've at least got it in our our
[1:01:07] ability you know
[1:01:10] amen and in that message I believe is
[1:01:13] the voice of the Archangel because the
[1:01:15] prophet said I give it to you the other
[1:01:17] week that he'd become visible Among Us
[1:01:19] and rais the dead and we'd go into
[1:01:21] rapture
[1:01:28] and then the bride would be gathered by
[1:01:30] the
[1:01:38] trumpet but could it
[1:01:44] be that even the fact that brother
[1:01:46] brandom would say Jesus does all
[1:01:51] three you know that blinds most people
[1:01:56] you know why it blinds
[1:01:57] them cuz they think they got something
[1:02:00] to do with
[1:02:06] it they think some man on Earth has got
[1:02:09] something to do with
[1:02:13] it come on am I
[1:02:20] right when if Jesus does all three let's
[1:02:23] give him the honor and Glory right
[1:02:26] amen it wasn't brother Brand's
[1:02:30] message it was the message of the Lord
[1:02:33] Jesus Christ
[1:02:37] amen yeah but now you're not giv enough
[1:02:40] honor honor to
[1:02:47] what my honor goes to the Lord Jesus
[1:02:51] Christ yes yes sir
[1:02:54] amen now
[1:02:59] now let's go into
[1:03:02] a a
[1:03:05] thought about his
[1:03:11] coming you know that part of his coming
[1:03:13] is already
[1:03:20] ped come on try to compare
[1:03:23] the voice the shout The Voice try to
[1:03:27] compare it in your mind to what we're
[1:03:28] talking about part of the coming of the
[1:03:30] Lord is already
[1:03:33] passed and we're not talking about the
[1:03:36] coming cuz that's why I said it's going
[1:03:37] to take so long to bring it because see
[1:03:39] you got a coming to the Jews that's got
[1:03:41] to be dealt with you got to come into
[1:03:43] the world that's got to be dealt with
[1:03:45] but I'm not talking about none of those
[1:03:47] things until we get there
[1:03:50] okay we're talking about the
[1:03:53] coming of the Lord to you and I
[1:04:01] what about
[1:04:07] it what about when we get on over we'll
[1:04:10] jump way over
[1:04:12] now try to come back to
[1:04:18] it go over to number 10
[1:04:22] brother Joe
[1:04:27] taken from Christ The Mystery of God
[1:04:31] revealed and look what he says paragraph
[1:04:35] 205 now the coming of the
[1:04:38] Lord is in
[1:04:42] mystery no mystery to it the Skies open
[1:04:45] up we hear
[1:04:49] a
[1:04:52] right well ain't no mystery to none of
[1:04:55] that
[1:04:56] he's
[1:05:00] coming well stage one of his coming is
[1:05:04] already
[1:05:07] transpired and we're in stage
[1:05:13] two of his
[1:05:17] coming just as the shouts already
[1:05:20] sounded of the
[1:05:22] Rapture and we're in stage two of the
[1:05:25] rapture
[1:05:31] comparing the second or the coming of
[1:05:33] the Lord and Joe changed that word
[1:05:36] instead of the second coming I put a
[1:05:37] title at the top put the coming of the
[1:05:40] Lord so it actually technically fit you
[1:05:42] know what I'm saying in
[1:05:45] there now the coming of the Lord is in
[1:05:49] mystery we don't know when he's
[1:05:52] coming how he's
[1:05:54] coming but we know he's coming I hope
[1:05:57] you got your windows rolled up we're
[1:05:59] getting some rain that we've been
[1:06:01] kneading thank
[1:06:05] God so was all the mysteries of God
[1:06:07] waiting for this life's
[1:06:10] day want
[1:06:12] you after he's already been
[1:06:18] completed then he
[1:06:21] reveals and shows what he's done
[1:06:26] well why are we looking out under
[1:06:31] somewhere When I Look to what taking
[1:06:34] place but he never gave his mystery in
[1:06:36] full but the coming of the Lord is a
[1:06:39] mystery the Rapture is a
[1:06:47] mystery but we already talk about the
[1:06:49] shout as the message that went forth
[1:06:59] right we talk
[1:07:02] about the voice of the
[1:07:09] Archangel but what about his
[1:07:13] coming go ahead to number 11 the angel
[1:07:16] of the Covenant preach in 1954 301
[1:07:19] paragraph
[1:07:23] E6 but we'll be gone at that time yes
[1:07:26] sir there's a part of us that's Immortal
[1:07:29] no atam no hydrogen or nothing is needed
[1:07:31] for
[1:07:36] that are you listening what does that
[1:07:39] mean what part of us is Immortal that
[1:07:41] there's no atoms or no doings needed for
[1:07:44] that the soul of the individual that's
[1:07:47] born
[1:07:48] again
[1:07:51] right no hydrant or nothing needed for
[1:07:54] that it's
[1:07:56] we'll be caught up in a moment in the
[1:07:57] twinkle of an eye to meet the Lord in
[1:07:59] the hour watch there's three comings of
[1:08:02] the
[1:08:05] Lord now I just said a minute ago so
[1:08:08] I'll go back and say it now here we
[1:08:09] don't miss it I'm talking about
[1:08:13] bride I'm not talking about the world we
[1:08:16] got to deal with that when we get to
[1:08:17] that we got to talk about you know the
[1:08:20] End of Time Etc and then we got to talk
[1:08:22] about the coming of the Lord to the Jews
[1:08:29] right there's three comings of the Lord
[1:08:32] you know what there's three of
[1:08:34] everything in the scripture three is
[1:08:35] God's perfect number 3 7 12 24 40s
[1:08:40] 50s but three times he came once to
[1:08:45] redeem his
[1:08:48] bride that's already
[1:08:50] over that happened 2,000 years ago
[1:09:01] right wants to redeem his bride he comes
[1:09:04] the next time we meet him in the air to
[1:09:08] receive his
[1:09:11] bride he comes the next time in the
[1:09:14] Millennium with his bride that's after
[1:09:17] the wedding supper is over return back
[1:09:19] for the Millennium all
[1:09:23] right three comings with the
[1:09:28] Lord and one part of that is already
[1:09:34] over the coming to
[1:09:37] redeem is over
[1:09:40] with now you know what I mean it
[1:09:41] happened 2,000 years ago the process is
[1:09:44] still in and going just exactly like we
[1:09:47] talked about the shout that the people
[1:09:49] you know we say the shout well you know
[1:09:50] somebody come along and they just hear
[1:09:52] the message well that's just the
[1:09:53] beginning of the shout to them if
[1:09:55] they're not born again they're not even
[1:09:56] in the Rapture or
[1:09:58] nothing so you get born again the
[1:10:00] message becomes important that could be
[1:10:02] happening right
[1:10:03] now amen all right but look what he's
[1:10:06] getting
[1:10:09] to three comings of the Lord one to
[1:10:13] redeem his
[1:10:15] bride one to receive his
[1:10:19] bride the next time with his bride go
[1:10:22] ahead number 12 the Great coming revival
[1:10:27] and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit
[1:10:29] preaching 54
[1:10:32] 718a there will be three
[1:10:36] advents of the Lord
[1:10:39] Jesus the first to redeem his bride when
[1:10:43] he died for her second to receive his
[1:10:47] bride when he comes for her third with
[1:10:50] his bride for the Millennium and there
[1:10:52] will be three advents and one of the
[1:10:55] them is
[1:10:58] PED and the signposts are showing that
[1:11:01] we we're nearing the second Advent of
[1:11:04] the Lord Jesus we tried everything we've
[1:11:08] had all kind of big four meetings and
[1:11:10] you know man tried
[1:11:14] to go to Broken sister 1964
[1:11:18] 720 6 the
[1:11:23] evening see he makes three
[1:11:26] comings he come in three sons names he
[1:11:28] come in a trinity Father Son and Holy
[1:11:31] Ghost see all of it the same Christ the
[1:11:34] same God all the time now we know he
[1:11:36] come to bring three works of Grace
[1:11:38] justification sanctification baptism of
[1:11:40] the Holy Ghost everything in God is
[1:11:42] completed in
[1:11:43] three and so he come first to redeem his
[1:11:46] bride he comes second as a Rapture to
[1:11:51] take away his
[1:11:53] bride he comes third with his bride king
[1:11:56] and queen after that's when many people
[1:11:58] are expecting the
[1:12:01] coming see a lot of people are expecting
[1:12:03] his coming but
[1:12:07] how you know the Jews are looking for
[1:12:10] the coming of the
[1:12:11] Messiah
[1:12:14] right am I right
[1:12:17] amen but that's done transpired and they
[1:12:20] missed it
[1:12:25] could it be that we could miss the
[1:12:27] coming of the Lord because we're not
[1:12:29] placing it together
[1:12:37] correctly number 14 which is the future
[1:12:40] home I just given these to make sure you
[1:12:41] would follow it Jesus comes three times
[1:12:46] come once to redeem his bride next time
[1:12:48] to get his bride next time with his
[1:12:53] bride so the coming of the Lord is
[1:12:55] divided into three parts or whatever you
[1:12:57] want to call it
[1:12:59] advents whatever the words you want to
[1:13:03] use it's
[1:13:06] divided
[1:13:08] okay
[1:13:12] now remember what he says on Christ is
[1:13:15] revealed look at number 15 and we'll be
[1:13:16] through with the Reading
[1:13:19] part 1965 822 the morning service
[1:13:23] paragraph 81
[1:13:25] to dislocate the
[1:13:29] scriptures you might put his body
[1:13:31] together
[1:13:33] wrong the foot where the head should be
[1:13:35] or something just the same as other
[1:13:38] words you might have Jesus teaching
[1:13:41] Moses's message you might have or even
[1:13:45] Wesley teaching Luther's age you might
[1:13:48] have now our our age teaching
[1:13:52] Pentecost the Pentecostal message you
[1:13:55] see what a mess it would be Pentecost
[1:13:58] has already showed its colors Luther has
[1:14:00] already showed his went off in
[1:14:02] denominations it died right there the
[1:14:05] age took there it
[1:14:08] went now think about
[1:14:14] it if you looking at the
[1:14:19] scriptures and there's three
[1:14:22] comings of the Lord in the scripture
[1:14:27] one to redeem his bride two to take his
[1:14:30] bride
[1:14:31] away and three to come back to the
[1:14:34] Millennium now if you cross them
[1:14:36] scriptures up what are you doing you
[1:14:40] said boy that first coming of the Lord
[1:14:42] will be in that Millennial
[1:14:46] Reign you got your cow up in the
[1:14:51] tree because you're using words
[1:14:55] that are
[1:14:57] correct but misplacing
[1:15:02] them you got the Cal in the tree eating
[1:15:05] chist right that's
[1:15:10] right same with the
[1:15:13] Rapture
[1:15:15] right taking the scriptures and the
[1:15:17] things of the
[1:15:19] Rapture and applying this part of the
[1:15:21] Rapture over here and this part over
[1:15:23] here
[1:15:27] all right the Bible speaks that every I
[1:15:31] see
[1:15:34] him right that's one scripture of his
[1:15:41] coming but to the
[1:15:45] bride it's a secret
[1:15:49] coming one in the
[1:15:51] bed two in the bed one taken one left
[1:15:54] Secret
[1:15:57] two in the field one taken one left
[1:16:02] secret you
[1:16:04] see if we cross them scriptures up what
[1:16:06] have we
[1:16:12] got but yet we got the scriptures I give
[1:16:15] you the scripture I brother ever I see
[1:16:19] him well what do you mean well I mean
[1:16:23] just what the Bible say is there'll be a
[1:16:26] day whenever I'll see
[1:16:30] him we better not be it that
[1:16:34] day that's right we better not be
[1:16:36] standing out somewhere looking for
[1:16:39] it because that would have to be on over
[1:16:42] to the third phase stage whatever you
[1:16:47] want to call it of his
[1:16:52] coming cuz it can't be in our
[1:16:55] time because it's supposed to be a
[1:16:57] secret
[1:17:02] coming all right it definitely was not
[1:17:06] back there because all the world didn't
[1:17:08] see him you know they didn't have TV and
[1:17:11] internets and stuff like we got you
[1:17:16] know what did Brother around say1 to 1%
[1:17:20] he gave some small outstanding number of
[1:17:23] the people of the world today never even
[1:17:25] knew Jesus Christ was
[1:17:27] alive amen and he said then 1/10 and
[1:17:29] 1/10 of the Ten of that even followed
[1:17:32] him and then one10 of the 10 of that was
[1:17:34] the ones received
[1:17:39] him what about it
[1:17:45] church can we follow that the Rapture is
[1:17:48] in the process because the shout has
[1:17:50] already went forth
[1:17:55] then can we
[1:17:57] follow in the understanding to
[1:18:00] see that the coming of the Lord is in a
[1:18:04] process or whatever you want to call it
[1:18:07] you you put your words there don't have
[1:18:08] the education send me a note I'll change
[1:18:11] my letter to fit what you
[1:18:19] say but what about
[1:18:22] it what if we're taking scripture and
[1:18:25] looking for a certain coming and and and
[1:18:29] things to take
[1:18:32] place when that's not to
[1:18:35] us but that'll be to the
[1:18:40] Jews then you got what I just read there
[1:18:43] Jesus bringing John's message or Moses's
[1:18:45] message or
[1:18:51] whatever you're dislocating the
[1:18:53] scriptures
[1:18:57] and to do that look at the mass
[1:18:58] confusion you've
[1:19:03] caused bless God you can't tell me one
[1:19:06] day that Prophet I believe he said one
[1:19:09] day that ever I'll see him and the Bible
[1:19:12] said ever I'll see him you just better
[1:19:15] not be there whenever I sees
[1:19:22] him because the only way that could ever
[1:19:26] be is to
[1:19:28] be later at some event
[1:19:36] somewhere because every eye couldn't see
[1:19:38] him around the world
[1:19:41] today you know
[1:19:46] physically so you see what I'm
[1:19:49] doing trying to
[1:19:52] compare the coming of the Lord
[1:19:55] with the
[1:19:59] Rapture and see the Rapture as a process
[1:20:02] that's taking place and been taking
[1:20:04] place for a long
[1:20:07] time and that the coming of the Lord
[1:20:10] phase one stage one Advent one whatever
[1:20:13] you want to call it transpired 2,000
[1:20:17] years
[1:20:18] ago it took 4,000 years for him to come
[1:20:24] right that's right look at all the
[1:20:27] scriptures we're going to have would
[1:20:28] have to cover if we covered it
[1:20:32] all You' have to read every scripture of
[1:20:35] the Old
[1:20:37] Testament you have to get into the
[1:20:39] Psalms where they pierced my hands and
[1:20:41] my
[1:20:44] feet you have to get into Isaiah where
[1:20:47] John is to come and introduce
[1:20:50] him you have to go into a virgin shall
[1:20:53] conceive
[1:20:58] what little bit I understand I could be
[1:21:00] preaching 20 years on his first part of
[1:21:02] his
[1:21:10] coming but what is being said about his
[1:21:13] him being
[1:21:16] here no he yeah yeah we believe that we
[1:21:20] we believe he come back to our brother
[1:21:21] de we agree with you
[1:21:26] one of these
[1:21:30] days
[1:21:33] well according to your
[1:21:36] prophet he s in three advents three
[1:21:38] stages three whatever
[1:21:40] coming first to redeem his
[1:21:43] bride second time to get his
[1:21:46] bride third time with his
[1:21:49] bride I don't think now listen carefully
[1:21:52] to the wording please
[1:21:56] I don't think we need to be as concerned
[1:21:57] about whether he came or
[1:22:01] not and we know the whole thing is
[1:22:03] involved around all around the fact that
[1:22:06] he did come or there wouldn't be nothing
[1:22:07] for us come
[1:22:09] on but I don't think it's a problem or
[1:22:11] should be a point of us looking forward
[1:22:13] to his coming
[1:22:17] someday why not get down to where we're
[1:22:20] at
[1:22:24] what good is a God that come back
[1:22:27] there what good is a God that's coming
[1:22:30] out you
[1:22:33] under according to the Burning
[1:22:37] Bush Moses said who are you he said I am
[1:22:42] that I
[1:22:44] am the prophet said that meant
[1:22:47] everpresent for
[1:22:51] eternity there's no future there is no
[1:22:54] past amen yes
[1:22:59] sir sure Moses could look at Abraham
[1:23:02] Isaac and Jacob you know he knew the
[1:23:04] story of
[1:23:09] them and sure he like everybody was
[1:23:11] looking for an end of the
[1:23:15] world and the Lord
[1:23:18] coming but he wanted something personal
[1:23:20] present tense that's what I want right
[1:23:23] now church more than anything in the

[1:25:24] thing same 40 something years I've been
[1:25:27] preaching Jesus Christ the same
[1:25:28] yesterday today and forever to try to
[1:25:31] get this church to see something
[1:25:33] personal in your own life am that's
[1:25:37] right yes sir and brother colie was
[1:25:39] coming back out I believe at South
[1:25:40] Carolina we went to a meeting we was
[1:25:42] talking coming down the road I said
[1:25:44] brother
[1:25:45] collie things get to going wrong down
[1:25:47] Atlanta I said get out cuz you can't
[1:25:50] stay in a big city with things going
[1:25:52] wrong
[1:25:54] but I said what could we do you know we
[1:25:57] were just talking I said brother collie
[1:25:59] all I'm trying to do is plant enough
[1:26:01] word into
[1:26:02] you if I don't never see you again right
[1:26:06] you'll be
[1:26:09] there that's my goal that's my thoughts
[1:26:12] that's to my kids my grandkids great
[1:26:14] grandkids my wife to
[1:26:17] everyone cuz we're not promised to be
[1:26:19] around
[1:26:21] here right
[1:26:24] but to the point of saying listen no
[1:26:26] matter what takes
[1:26:31] place you take what's been brought to
[1:26:34] you and move
[1:26:38] on well we'll just sit down and listen
[1:26:40] to brother Dale's tapes something
[1:26:42] happens to
[1:26:44] him I ain't never taught nothing like
[1:26:48] that go what good would it do you to
[1:26:50] listen to him a second time if you
[1:26:52] didn't hear it the first time you slept
[1:26:54] the first time what you going to do the
[1:26:55] second time you argued and fussed about
[1:26:58] what I said the first time what you
[1:26:59] going to do the second time you
[1:27:04] understand
[1:27:07] comparing the coming of the Lord to the
[1:27:11] Rapture or comparing the Rapture to the
[1:27:14] coming of the Lord and to see the things
[1:27:17] that people are looking for part of it
[1:27:20] is already taken place
[1:27:28] but yet if we're still in the blindness
[1:27:29] of lady
[1:27:31] oia we're still looking for something
[1:27:33] that's already
[1:27:43] transpired looking for a message to come
[1:27:46] when we don't have a
[1:27:49] message
[1:27:51] right looking for the Lord Jesus to come
[1:27:54] when he's already come come
[1:28:00] on if he's going to become visible Among
[1:28:03] Us and raise the dead and go into
[1:28:06] Rapture then we got to be
[1:28:09] somewhere in that voice of the Archangel
[1:28:12] part of the Rapture and somewhere in the
[1:28:16] second stage of the
[1:28:19] coming which is dealing with
[1:28:25] the bride coming to the
[1:28:29] word right coming to get his
[1:28:34] bride all
[1:28:36] right he said we
[1:28:39] don't I lost all my notes part of it I
[1:28:42] got it in here but you know it if you
[1:28:43] don't I'll find it for
[1:28:45] you Jesus don't set foot on
[1:28:48] Earth until the
[1:28:51] Millennium we meet him in the air
[1:28:55] so I'm not talking about a
[1:28:59] physical Corporal mortal whatever his
[1:29:02] words
[1:29:05] natural of the coming of the
[1:29:11] Lord but yet he'd be so visible Among
[1:29:15] Us what by
[1:29:21] Revelation you see church when I heard
[1:29:23] that the first
[1:29:25] time 40 something years
[1:29:28] ago the raptures
[1:29:33] Revelation and I heard him say that the
[1:29:35] bride be waiting for the
[1:29:38] Revelation I knew it was not just the
[1:29:40] fact that I had walked out of a Baptist
[1:29:46] Church and it accepted this message that
[1:29:49] automatically put me into
[1:29:52] everything because because this message
[1:29:55] revealed to me showed me I was not born
[1:30:01] again now how many of you will say it
[1:30:05] that
[1:30:09] way how many preachers would ever say
[1:30:13] that this message showed them they
[1:30:14] wern't born again that's right well what
[1:30:17] do you mean I had a preacher what do you
[1:30:19] mean brother de you come
[1:30:22] out you left that
[1:30:24] denomination you like brother Mo said
[1:30:26] you get your coat and hat and leave you
[1:30:28] know and you see them today they just
[1:30:30] keep changing houses and he getting
[1:30:33] another coat and hat another coat and
[1:30:37] hat
[1:30:42] right but you see he doesn't set foot on
[1:30:45] the
[1:30:47] earth until the
[1:30:50] Millennium we meet him in the
[1:30:52] air I wrote WR down word could give
[1:30:57] it but I can't be glad to find
[1:31:02] it oh okay go to number three brother
[1:31:05] Joe which is a sardan church age
[1:31:08] preached in 1960 1209 let me read this
[1:31:12] real
[1:31:15] quick let me tell you something the
[1:31:17] Bible says that when Jesus comes before
[1:31:20] he comes there would rise false prophets
[1:31:22] and there would be there would rise
[1:31:24] false
[1:31:26] jesuses that's right no
[1:31:30] here now remember when he says now
[1:31:33] nobody's going to call theirself Jesus
[1:31:35] you remember that he said people
[1:31:37] wouldn't have that so he's not meaning
[1:31:40] people rais up I'm Jesus I'm Jesus
[1:31:42] anointed
[1:31:44] ones
[1:31:46] right but let me just drop this into
[1:31:49] your
[1:31:50] heart there will never be a Jesus set a
[1:31:53] foot on Earth on this Earth until the
[1:31:56] church done raptured and
[1:32:00] gone now you just bear that in mind
[1:32:04] because there will be false Christ rise
[1:32:09] up now what's he connecting the two
[1:32:11] together
[1:32:12] for evidently their Doctrine is going to
[1:32:16] say that Jesus is coming
[1:32:19] physically
[1:32:20] right come on read
[1:32:24] now you just bear that in mind because
[1:32:26] there will be false Christ rise up but
[1:32:29] Jesus will never will not be here on
[1:32:31] Earth because the trumpet sounds and he
[1:32:34] never comes we meet him in the air the
[1:32:37] church is already gone and then when
[1:32:39] Jesus appears it'll be the returning
[1:32:42] back the Gentiles goes to meet him in
[1:32:45] the
[1:32:47] air is that scripture see they go to
[1:32:51] meet him in the air and then we go we go
[1:32:53] up
[1:32:54] and Jesus is never puts his foot on the
[1:32:57] earth until the church has been raptured
[1:33:00] and took home and the wedding suppers
[1:33:03] over in heaven then he returns back
[1:33:06] after the Jewish
[1:33:08] Remnant see while we're here doing that
[1:33:10] he's coming back to the Jews all right
[1:33:12] what's the other
[1:33:13] one what's the three comings what's the
[1:33:17] LI with the bride into the Millennium we
[1:33:21] will be here then in physical bodies and
[1:33:24] he will be here in that so why are we
[1:33:28] looking for some Corporal
[1:33:31] coming and if you'll check the things on
[1:33:34] these you'll hear one thing brother
[1:33:36] randam is saying he said people says as
[1:33:40] oil on their blood on their hand oil on
[1:33:43] their forehead he said they're saying
[1:33:45] the Corporal body of Jesus is
[1:33:49] here now that's false prophets
[1:33:54] what would happen in this message if you
[1:33:56] started somebody running around getting
[1:33:58] blood on
[1:34:00] their out of their hands and oil on
[1:34:03] their floor
[1:34:06] forehead some of you are
[1:34:09] diabetics and you prick your
[1:34:12] finger and you prick your
[1:34:15] finger now I'm I'm honest 90% of the
[1:34:19] time no blood comes
[1:34:22] out until you squeeze
[1:34:26] it right am I right I mean I'm giving
[1:34:29] you 10% now so all
[1:34:34] right I read back in some of the
[1:34:37] Pentecostal doings what they done was
[1:34:39] they put pins around their
[1:34:41] belt or somewhere and they would stick
[1:34:44] their
[1:34:47] fingers and then they start rubbing
[1:34:49] their hands and
[1:34:55] blood comes
[1:34:59] out that would mean the Corporal body's
[1:35:02] here if you getting
[1:35:03] blood and I don't think my blood nor
[1:35:08] your
[1:35:09] blood would be the blood type of the
[1:35:12] Lord Jesus Christ because he was not Jew
[1:35:16] nor
[1:35:17] Gentile he was God I'd want to analyze
[1:35:20] the blood and if I find yours in there
[1:35:23] I'm going to say stinking dirty
[1:35:26] blood but you
[1:35:28] see but brother
[1:35:31] Dale oh it's just wonderful to see these
[1:35:34] great
[1:35:39] manifestations what are you looking
[1:35:45] for when I hear these brothers preach
[1:35:47] and I just feel so good I Hear You
[1:35:49] Preach I feel down and out
[1:35:55] I'm grinning I don't know what you're
[1:35:59] doing you know the reason you're feeling
[1:36:01] down and
[1:36:04] out you're not thinking
[1:36:09] right because if what I preach to you
[1:36:11] tonight is the
[1:36:15] truth that the first phase of the
[1:36:17] Rapture has already transpired the
[1:36:20] shout the first phase of the coming of
[1:36:23] the Lord Lord has already transpired he
[1:36:26] came to redeem his
[1:36:28] bride why wouldn't you
[1:36:44] shout what about it
[1:36:47] folks could we be looking for
[1:36:50] something that had already passed
[1:37:05] could we be looking for the second phase
[1:37:07] of
[1:37:07] the Rapture as the voice of the
[1:37:12] Archangel and to come find out that he's
[1:37:14] been with us all this
[1:37:22] time and it is the part of his second
[1:37:25] coming to the bride is what the prophet
[1:37:30] said I'll give you the quote but I'm not
[1:37:32] going to read
[1:37:35] it he said in the bride coming of
[1:37:43] Christ now you remember the rest of
[1:37:46] that who wants to quote the rest of it
[1:37:48] for
[1:37:50] me coming out of the church
[1:37:57] you mean sister Gail the second coming
[1:37:59] of Christ is dealing with us coming out
[1:38:01] of the
[1:38:01] church that's evidently what he said he
[1:38:05] said in the bride coming of
[1:38:08] Christ coming out of the
[1:38:12] church you know that we could be a whole
[1:38:14] lot further up the road than what we
[1:38:15] think we are
[1:38:26] well see people don't want to talk about
[1:38:27] that Brother Gary asked me one day
[1:38:29] brother Dale do you think we have the
[1:38:30] faith of the fathers I said yes didn't
[1:38:33] stop to think didn't
[1:38:37] Mumble and I wouldn't meaning everybody
[1:38:40] had it I wouldn't even mean it that I
[1:38:42] even had it I was meaning it was here
[1:38:47] Amen brother Dale do you believe we're
[1:38:49] in the voice of the Archangel I believe
[1:38:52] it

[1:39:02] to Christ I believe
[1:39:08] it well okay now I'll go along with you
[1:39:12] okay we we we'll try to find a happy
[1:39:14] meeting ground I don't want no happy
[1:39:16] meeting ground I ain't never ask nobody
[1:39:18] to compromise with me you stand on what
[1:39:21] you believe right
[1:39:23] and you're a hypocrite if you
[1:39:29] want follow the
[1:39:32] next do you believe that we've heard the
[1:39:39] trumpet you know shout voice
[1:39:50] Trump I thought we believe when we
[1:39:53] receive the new birth we were
[1:39:54] resurrected sitting in Heavenly places
[1:39:56] in Christ Jesus and the only part that's
[1:39:58] physically in the earth down here is my
[1:40:00] body that's
[1:40:03] right the rest of me is already
[1:40:06] Heavenly you know by the new

[1:44:17] water downside the ocean they rolled
[1:44:19] this carpet right down to the water he
[1:44:22] was going to walk on
[1:44:24] water he took two or three steps and he
[1:44:28] stopped he said there's one unbeliever
[1:44:31] in this crowd and I can't do

[1:49:23] your Prophet said the biggest portion of
[1:49:24] the Old Testament was
[1:49:27] fulfilled in the last hours and maybe he
[1:49:31] said few hours or whatever but we know
[1:49:34] he wasn't on the cross that
[1:49:37] long
[1:49:38] right during the time that he was
[1:49:41] hanging on that
[1:49:43] cross the biggest portion of the

[1:50:53] in the
[1:50:54] Bible can't tell the seasons except the
[1:50:57] shedding of the leaves the budding of
[1:50:59] the trees that ain't in the
[1:51:03] Bible

[1:51:08] something to take
[1:51:10] place and he just walk right Among Us
[1:51:13] and walk right

[1:51:19] bride is going into rapture
[1:51:24] only those filled with the Holy Ghost is
[1:51:26] going to go in the Rapture so that means
[1:51:28] there's a lot of people going to be
[1:51:31] left but you know what they're not going
[1:51:33] to believe
[1:51:35] that we're

[1:52:03] to fly off
[1:52:05] with of good
[1:52:07] people they had it all figured
[1:52:11] out you know that when Jesus came a lot
[1:52:15] of the people wanted to believe
[1:52:17] him cuz they could see the signs and the
[1:52:20] Wonders
[1:52:23] but if they believed him it would have
[1:52:24] been excommunicated out of the
[1:52:28] church and because of
[1:52:30] that what about an illustration in the
[1:52:33] Bible you got a child and he's born
[1:52:38] [Music]
[1:52:40] blind and all at once one day his eyes
[1:52:44] come open well how'd that happen well
[1:52:47] this man named Jesus spit on the ground
[1:52:50] of which one it is now you can put them
[1:52:51] all together
[1:52:54] put a little Clay on the Man's eyes and
[1:52:55] he come
[1:52:57] forth you know what the mom and daddy
[1:53:01] said they faced faced excommunication

[1:53:35] answer paraphrasing it he said it like
[1:53:37] this he said whether this man be of God
[1:53:40] or not I don't know but
[1:53:44] said I can
[1:53:47] see and you have been around here all
[1:53:51] this time and I Stay

[1:54:05] it church is time to open her eyes and
[1:54:08] the reality of
