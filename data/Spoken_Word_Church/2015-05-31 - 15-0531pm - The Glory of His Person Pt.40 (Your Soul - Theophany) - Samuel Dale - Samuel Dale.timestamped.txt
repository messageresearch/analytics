[8:06] he didn't lift us up to let us down
[8:37] hey man hey I had the opportunity
[8:40] to give a testimony the other night at
[8:42] the Full Gospel business and Men meeting
[8:44] in Gainesville and what came across my
[8:48] mind was brother dick was out of town in
[8:49] 2006 and I got a pair of leading song
[8:52] music one afternoon if you remember
[8:54] and something struck me just like a
[8:57] spear hit me in the back and that's that
[8:58] period of time I went through with
[9:00] osteomyelitis and was very very sick and
[9:04] so I gave a testimony and
[9:06] you know if you don't
[9:09] never take or never pass up the
[9:11] opportunity to share what the Lord's
[9:13] done
[9:14] especially a testimony there's a time or
[9:17] pray for somebody don't ever pass up the
[9:20] time to stop and pray for somebody if
[9:22] it's burdens on your heart I've I've
[9:25] failed to do that one time and it
[9:27] worried me it worried me till I came
[9:28] across that person again but just a
[9:31] little testimony that about this time of
[9:33] year no brother dick was out of out and
[9:35] I just praise God for his healing
[9:36] atonement amen that testimony in itself
[9:39] was just a god-working
[9:41] but it was pain his weakness leaving the
[9:44] body so
[9:46] that's all about our healing amen
[9:48] B Flair

[15:33] from
[15:34] Revelations 1 and then we read from
[15:37] Philippians 2 we'll try to continue our
[15:39] thought on to you know this message uh
[15:44] to a lot of people thought that I was
[15:46] talking about
[15:47] the wrong Anna this morning is our
[15:50] daughter Anna that's having the
[15:52] operation Thursday so remember to pray
[15:55] for her I'm sure sister Anna marunga
[15:59] would tell you to pray for her too but
[16:01] not about an operation so just remember
[16:04] that it's Anna Roberts and they will be
[16:08] cake and ice cream after the service
[16:11] today so make sure you do and we're glad
[16:15] to have one more we're getting more
[16:17] people on the platform playing uh
[16:20] musical instruments than we used to have
[16:22] in the church all together so little
[16:25] Esther black is now playing the mandolin
[16:27] with us so we appreciate that
[16:30] Gloria
[16:32] give you a gift you use the gift you
[16:34] know and put it to work it'll work all
[16:37] right
[16:38] I think we've got all of the
[16:39] announcements but remember now the uh
[16:42] bible study this coming Saturday six
[16:46] o'clock come and be with us and then
[16:48] remember the Father's Day fishing for
[16:51] the brothers and for the sisters on the
[16:53] Friday night of that week they will be
[16:56] having their time here to church too
[16:58] kind of a little art and class and
[17:00] things and doing and eating together and
[17:02] fellowshipping I like to see people get
[17:05] together because you know you you've
[17:07] always said and a lot of people do you
[17:09] know well we just don't have no
[17:11] Fellowship you know nobody won't get the
[17:14] world if you'll get together we have
[17:16] something for you to do sometime to
[17:19] where you can Fellowship together
[17:20] because that's what we want to do you
[17:23] know and to make it that way so you
[17:26] don't have an excuse to say well well we
[17:28] just don't what you mean is you want
[17:30] everybody to get in your ship in your
[17:33] front yard you know probably your own
[17:36] home but uh you know sometimes you have
[17:38] to get out and go and everything else in
[17:41] other people's ship to do a little bit
[17:43] all right so just remember that okay
[17:47] the heavenly father we thank you that
[17:49] today and the hour has come upon mankind
[17:51] that we can truly talk about is Paul and
[17:55] Peter Nim would say that the end of all
[17:58] things has come upon us
[18:00] we know that we are not making dates and
[18:03] setting times we're not concerned about
[18:05] that
[18:06] we're concerned about getting ready
[18:08] against the day that we're living and
[18:11] that would be more important than to
[18:14] know anything about the day or the hour
[18:16] who's going to be president what's going
[18:17] to be that's not for us to worry about
[18:20] you said you put in Kings and you take
[18:23] out Kings who you take care of all that
[18:25] business we just sit back and and watch
[18:28] it all transpire we ask you to be with
[18:31] us and bless now remember the sick one
[18:32] remember Brother Gary touching mother
[18:34] and just delivering from that because we
[18:36] believe in a total deliverance we thank
[18:39] you for all of the medical signs you
[18:41] have given us and things that we can do
[18:44] Lord and help our Earthly bodies and
[18:47] things as we hurt and things we thank
[18:49] you
[18:50] but we know who the healer is we know
[18:53] who the deliverer is we thank you for
[18:55] that have your way now forgive our sins
[18:58] cleanse us from all unrighteousness and
[19:00] keep us in Jesus name
[19:02] you mean
[19:04] all right Revelations
[19:09] 112 and I turned to see the voice that
[19:11] spake with me and being turned I saw
[19:14] seven golden candlesticks in the midst
[19:16] of the seven candlesticks one like unto
[19:18] the son of man clothed with a garment
[19:20] down to the foot and gird about the
[19:22] pouch with a golden girdle his head and
[19:24] his hairs were white like wool as white
[19:27] as snow and his eyes were as a flame of
[19:30] fire and his feet like undefined Bryce
[19:33] as if they burned in a furnace and his
[19:36] voice as the sound of many
[19:39] Waters all right remember now
[19:42] that's what we're talking about his the
[19:45] glory of his person
[19:48] all right so now we go to Philippians 2
[19:50] and verse 5.
[19:52] let this mind be in you which was also
[19:54] in Christ Jesus who being in the form of
[19:58] God thought it not robbery to be equal
[20:00] with God but made himself of no
[20:02] reputation and took upon him the form of
[20:04] a servant
[20:05] and was made in the likeness of men and
[20:08] being found
[20:10] in fashion as a man he humbled himself
[20:13] and became obedient to death even the
[20:17] death of the Cross you may be seated the
[20:20] Lord had his Blessing to the reading of
[20:23] the word
[20:24] now they're not to try to back up much
[20:26] but to
[20:27] you know tie the thought together and
[20:30] continue on
[20:33] because surely by now after all of these
[20:35] years you were to at least know one
[20:38] thing for certain
[20:39] you know that brother Dale believes in a
[20:42] real God
[20:44] and you know a lot of people have have
[20:47] went through it and I'm not throwing off
[20:48] now
[20:50] but you know back when they what was
[20:52] that guy's name
[20:54] altizer was that his name anyhow the guy
[20:56] that said God was dead uh you know when
[20:59] that went out and he published stats you
[21:01] know saying God is dead you know
[21:04] everybody oh every denomination ever
[21:07] thing you know oh no God's Not Dead we
[21:11] talked to him this morning we prayed to
[21:13] him and all that was well and good
[21:15] that's that's fine that's not a a
[21:18] problem
[21:20] in in the sincerity though of it is what
[21:25] kind of a god did they believe in
[21:29] you know
[21:32] did they have anything to take
[21:35] show of that God
[21:38] right then you move up into ranks and
[21:40] you get into places if you got
[21:44] churches that believe in signs and
[21:46] wonders and and you have those things in
[21:48] order to take place
[21:49] and uh
[21:51] but the point is what about the word
[21:58] if the new birth is the birth of the
[22:00] word and I believe that the way that
[22:02] I've always tried to teach it to you
[22:06] all right then God must be the word
[22:09] and not just letters on a page
[22:13] but it must be the very god of the word
[22:15] the the word the letters the spirit the
[22:18] all and all
[22:20] and Jesus is his name all right then in
[22:23] that we're watching him condescend down
[22:25] to uh
[22:28] you know
[22:29] to life and doings and and asking you uh
[22:34] what kind of a god do you have
[22:37] I'm honest I've always tried to be with
[22:39] you as sincere as I can uh why serve a
[22:43] God that you don't believe that he can
[22:45] take care of your problem
[22:48] I mean what's the purpose is it just a
[22:50] totem pole
[22:52] but you know to most people God is no
[22:54] more than a totem foe totem pole uh
[22:57] religion form because
[22:59] it's just what they've been taught all
[23:00] their life and they just go to church
[23:02] and they do and they they're wonderful
[23:04] and all that's wonderful and great but
[23:07] what about the one true and living God
[23:10] what do we have to understand all about
[23:12] God to be able to to
[23:15] have salvation
[23:19] but
[23:20] may I turn it around
[23:23] how can you have salvation without
[23:24] knowing about God
[23:27] you know a doctor friend of mine he I
[23:30] was talking to him one day there and he
[23:33] he was saying that some people you know
[23:35] were kind of making light of him that
[23:36] they were you know more in the atheist
[23:38] form and doctors and things and said one
[23:42] of them said to him said
[23:43] I don't see how you can believe in a
[23:45] real God knowing as much as you do about
[23:47] medical science
[23:50] he said
[23:52] I don't see how you can know as much as
[23:54] you know about medical science and not
[23:57] believe in a God you know
[24:00] well see that's that's the truth that's
[24:02] the point
[24:03] but this my point is to make sure that
[24:07] we serve a true God
[24:10] and not just the thoughts of our mind or
[24:12] or what mama taught us or what you know
[24:17] but to believe in God as being real
[24:22] and that whatever real he is
[24:25] remember he always has been
[24:29] because he doesn't change
[24:31] is that the scripture I'm God and I
[24:33] change not right
[24:34] he doesn't he doesn't change with time
[24:37] we change
[24:39] but he doesn't change he's always been
[24:41] the same
[24:42] now he may not reveal himself in the
[24:45] ages of down through time as being uh
[24:49] all you know at one way because that's
[24:51] the unfolding but remember
[24:55] once it's unfolded all of the pieces
[24:58] have got to be put together to make the
[25:00] puzzle so how can you uh not accept what
[25:03] Luther taught
[25:05] or the just shall live by faith
[25:07] how is it we would not you know that we
[25:09] could would not accept what Wesley
[25:12] taught of sanctification or what do many
[25:15] others you know the that come down
[25:17] through there in Azusa Street Pentecost
[25:19] where would we reject something like
[25:22] that and try to believe in God
[25:25] we can't do it it's got to stay and
[25:27] remain the same all right now but
[25:30] remember Hebrews 13 8 said he's the same
[25:32] yesterday today and forever
[25:35] the prophet would say it this away he
[25:37] said whatever he is he always was
[25:42] because he doesn't change
[25:45] all right so why can't we believe that
[25:48] as being the reality of him being real
[25:53] instead of just thinking well you know
[25:55] God is a spirit and we're you know we
[25:57] just don't really know about God uh the
[26:00] theologians can't explain it well
[26:05] I I haven't never asked any of them to
[26:07] explain it to me because I I the one
[26:11] that I depend upon is the holy spirit
[26:13] that is within me
[26:15] because he's the only one that's the
[26:18] only one that can explain it to me even
[26:19] brother Branham in greatest he was to
[26:22] make it as simple as he did
[26:24] it still didn't reveal God to the world
[26:27] it's not going to do that
[26:29] you know it might might be enough to
[26:31] condemn them yeah but not enough to save
[26:33] them
[26:34] because that's the point all right so
[26:37] then I believe in a real God I believe
[26:39] in real salvation
[26:41] I believe in the reality of Life of
[26:43] doings and you know and knowing that God
[26:45] is real
[26:47] and uh you know everything's okay
[26:54] uh
[26:56] maybe we can
[26:57] get this thing straightened out
[27:00] somewhere
[27:01] I'll pin it up nothing else
[27:03] maybe that'll do it
[27:05] okay may not look too good but it
[27:07] stopped the bloom Plum I don't know if I
[27:10] can hear it I know you can all right but
[27:13] listen
[27:15] the point is
[27:17] you know we we remark about people
[27:20] saying God is dead
[27:23] but see I don't think the demand back
[27:25] there even was saying God died
[27:29] right
[27:30] you know because it'd be stupid to think
[27:32] it's of a God and then God died
[27:35] I mean that would be stupidity in the
[27:37] highest form if you're going to believe
[27:39] in a God and then believe that God died
[27:41] well that would make him something like
[27:43] we are but to believe that he died in
[27:46] the lives of the people then I would
[27:48] agree
[27:49] I would agree to that that the biggest
[27:51] portion of people of the world today
[27:53] that their God is a is in the form of a
[27:56] totem pole it may be called Jesus
[28:00] brother Reynolds said you can call him
[28:01] Jesus Jesus and worship the devil
[28:04] now that's
[28:06] that's pretty strong right
[28:10] yeah all right
[28:11] but now we got down to trying to bring
[28:14] it forth as we've been teaching it for
[28:16] months and months and months bringing it
[28:18] down to to the truth of the one true and
[28:21] living God and seeing that we tied it in
[28:25] this morning as to Bringing Down that I
[28:28] hope you caught that point that whatever
[28:30] he was he was back there then he
[28:33] literally uh in his descending he he was
[28:37] lowering himself instead of being over
[28:40] here and getting greater going that way
[28:43] he was really bringing himself downward
[28:47] to where that we could start from
[28:49] Genesis 1 and then go back upward in our
[28:54] understanding our Revelation you know to
[28:57] where we could see God in the way that
[29:00] we're supposed to see him
[29:03] well then he was just as real before the
[29:05] world as he is now
[29:07] because we're the ones that's dethroned
[29:09] him I I like a message that brought a
[29:11] random priest back there he said uh you
[29:15] know
[29:15] dethroning God you know an exactly title
[29:19] but it's dethroning
[29:22] what about the one where he preached
[29:24] like raising God from history
[29:28] now what does he mean by that
[29:32] well he was that big here and they they
[29:34] lost him enough
[29:36] that's no that's not my understanding
[29:39] when you're talking about raising God
[29:41] from history you're you're trying to
[29:43] bring him to the position that he always
[29:46] wanted to be
[29:47] not trying to raise him up is something
[29:50] else all right
[29:51] and seeing that one true and living God
[29:55] I'm seeing how real he is and how that
[29:58] he's manifest himself
[30:00] and all of the titles
[30:03] are the things that the Bible would call
[30:06] him
[30:07] you know that theologians would come up
[30:09] with words
[30:10] and that's where brother random picked
[30:12] it up from because see like logos means
[30:15] speech or or thought presented by speech
[30:19] or words all right see then uh he would
[30:23] be talking about uh theophany
[30:26] and see we've got our minds still hooked
[30:28] on oh it's way up that way
[30:30] when that's not what the scripture even
[30:32] says he said if this perfectly
[30:34] Tabernacle word dissolved we have one
[30:38] all right before the world God knew
[30:42] everybody that it would ever be saved
[30:44] right
[30:45] and he wrote our names in The Book of
[30:47] Life or left them out right
[30:49] well what's the problem
[30:52] you got to have something up yonder
[30:56] you know or is it in his mind
[31:00] the I'm trying to get us to see God here
[31:04] a god up in heaven doesn't help us very
[31:07] much
[31:08] all right
[31:09] you ain't careful you just got a totem
[31:11] pole you're trying to beg him to come
[31:13] down huh I'm trying to get him to where
[31:16] that he'll come into reality because
[31:19] that we can call him on the scene
[31:21] all right now see then those words that
[31:25] we use
[31:26] are words like Elohim
[31:29] that's a word in the the the
[31:32] scholars would know those words
[31:35] but see then when you break it down as
[31:37] meaning self-existing now it's coming
[31:40] down to understanding for you and I
[31:43] right
[31:44] it's bringing God forth into our words
[31:48] you know I I love to listen to The
[31:51] Prophet's message because that's what
[31:52] caught my attention
[31:54] was how that a man could take the the
[31:58] the things and even use the big words
[32:03] that the theologians would use you know
[32:06] and uh but he could make that simple
[32:09] enough
[32:10] that I could understand it
[32:13] you know and you know to do that he had
[32:16] to put a lot of it in his own words
[32:20] brother random will say something and
[32:22] he'll said see that the Bible says that
[32:24] and there's literally not a trend not a
[32:26] word verbatim of what he said
[32:29] but it's his thought from the word
[32:33] well I'll take that won't you
[32:35] I'll just stay with that part and
[32:37] believe it all right
[32:38] now
[32:39] so then we got down to thinking and
[32:41] talking about why can't we just see that
[32:44] if if a theophany is a word body
[32:50] not just a body produced by the word
[32:54] but a word body
[32:55] why can't we believe that as being
[32:57] something real
[33:00] why not make it that simple
[33:04] why not simplify in the basis of logos
[33:08] theophany speech
[33:11] you know simplify it and just simply say
[33:14] God is real
[33:20] what's what's the problem
[33:23] see the other way you think in your mind
[33:25] is so great is you've got all these
[33:26] words
[33:28] you make it sound so beautiful
[33:32] but it's like I've always tried to
[33:33] explain to you I know how to wire a
[33:35] house
[33:36] I know how to cook hook up the whole
[33:38] house and wire it I can do every bit of
[33:40] it I can do three ways I can do
[33:42] basically any type of house wiring
[33:47] well I'd be an idiot to want to talk to
[33:49] Einstein
[33:54] but all it is is just a little higher
[33:56] electrical outlets and fixes and
[33:59] you remember the first computer covered
[34:02] a city block
[34:03] you know the reason it did it had so
[34:05] many on and off switches
[34:08] that it took that much territory for it
[34:11] to cover all right
[34:13] but
[34:15] see the point I'm trying to get you is
[34:17] is why can't we make it
[34:19] simple enough
[34:21] to see our own sails and to see what's
[34:23] taking place
[34:26] and then that way it's not making it
[34:28] something great
[34:30] he's already great we don't have to make
[34:32] him anything
[34:33] we just try to believe him all right
[34:37] and tying together all we did this
[34:39] morning and bringing it out to the bases
[34:41] and seeing what and all of those
[34:43] terminologies
[34:44] logos theophthany's word word body
[34:48] anything you want to bring in Son of God
[34:52] um great words
[34:55] that we come to
[34:56] can be simply summed up in one thing
[35:00] God is real
[35:05] and that not not that God has a soul
[35:08] because then you'll run into your nature
[35:10] situation
[35:12] but to say that God is a soul
[35:15] because what is a soul
[35:17] so being it's a person it's what you are
[35:22] right but but brother down all I see is
[35:24] outside
[35:28] well if we have time to get through the
[35:30] things when brother Branham went beyond
[35:32] the curtain of time you know what he he
[35:34] didn't see as I said this morning not
[35:36] making light of nothing
[35:38] he's telling the truth he didn't see
[35:39] little inch square compartments he
[35:41] didn't see little floating Spirits
[35:43] floating around he even in his early
[35:46] Ministry before he had went there he
[35:50] believed that he would be able to see
[35:52] those people
[35:54] but he would not be able to touch him
[35:56] you remember that
[35:58] he said I'd see brother Neville and see
[36:01] him well he didn't say I just see his
[36:03] foot floating by and say Hey Brother
[36:04] Neville you know no no he explained it
[36:07] that it would have hand and it would he
[36:09] would see it he'd know his brother
[36:10] Neville but that he couldn't touch it
[36:14] but when he went beyond the curtain of
[36:15] time he found
[36:17] it was a whole lot more real than that
[36:20] all right
[36:21] and watch as we get on down to it then
[36:23] what did he see
[36:30] when Jesus descended to preach to the
[36:32] spirits that were in prison brother
[36:34] Randall said he saw them
[36:37] and we'll read it in a minute where he's
[36:39] talking about both
[36:42] The Sinner and the saint
[36:45] he saw them in the same form of a body
[36:51] that that's what Jesus went and preached
[36:53] to the same form of the body of the
[36:55] people that he saw beyond the curtain of
[36:58] time
[36:59] I mean do we decrease did something
[37:01] happen and all at once but see the the
[37:04] main thing is people can't get it
[37:06] together to see how that within us
[37:10] is a soul that that's what we are
[37:14] right this out here I can deceive you
[37:16] with it
[37:20] I can deceive you with this outward
[37:22] parts
[37:23] but inside of there
[37:25] may I quote wrote around him
[37:30] have you ever noticed him explaining the
[37:32] lie detector test
[37:37] to where you can't lie you know because
[37:39] something
[37:40] now
[37:42] be real careful don't answer me
[37:46] is the lie detector detesting your
[37:48] spirit
[37:50] or your soul
[37:59] okay you're going to jump to the spirit
[38:01] right but you better jump off in a hurry
[38:04] because the spirit can be activated and
[38:07] done
[38:09] and you know what I can do they can hook
[38:11] up that because I remember seeing it
[38:13] in a movie one time and I thought well
[38:15] that's a good point I'll remember that
[38:17] he was asking a man a question and he
[38:19] had a pen sticking in his leg
[38:23] every time that question was asked he's
[38:26] picked that pen well that pen showed it
[38:29] made that movement
[38:31] and they thought he was telling the
[38:32] truth
[38:34] when he was lying like everything to him
[38:36] all right
[38:38] see that Spirit can be fooled with
[38:41] with that inner part of you can't lie
[38:46] come on even if it's Fallen estate it's
[38:48] in the image of God
[38:50] so get away from it get to thinking
[38:54] that's what I want you to do I want you
[38:55] to think things over
[38:59] see that that being that we are the soul
[39:02] is a whole lot more real than this body
[39:05] you're looking at
[39:07] right because this body you're looking
[39:08] at it will go back to the dust rotting
[39:11] and Decay totally annihilated
[39:14] other than a spoon of dust
[39:19] but that Soul lives on
[39:22] brother Branham didn't see little Spooks
[39:24] beyond the curtain of time
[39:29] he described the people
[39:33] that even the men had a
[39:36] maybe a little long hair
[39:39] you remember them
[39:42] you know
[39:44] he described them to the detail
[39:46] see that was where did I used to be and
[39:48] I told you I preached it but when I seen
[39:51] the truth about it I could come back
[39:52] here and told you I used to think that
[39:54] the theosity would be no way
[39:57] that it could have any feelings
[39:59] whatsoever
[40:02] because I knew the quotes from The
[40:04] Prophet about the things that a
[40:06] theophany don't eat et cetera and things
[40:08] like that
[40:10] but then one day when I noticed
[40:13] he said they went beyond the curtain of
[40:15] time
[40:17] and they had their senses he said when
[40:18] Jesus went and preached to the spirits
[40:20] in prison he said he had all his senses
[40:23] well see we want to put senses to body
[40:26] connected through spirit
[40:31] I'm still trying my best to explain how
[40:34] real God he is
[40:36] you may think that I'm over on the other
[40:38] part but I'm trying my best to explain
[40:40] how real he is
[40:42] and what is
[40:45] all right
[40:47] go see he's more real than anything we
[40:49] think about
[40:51] because he created us
[40:54] that would be enough right there
[40:56] tonight but yeah we do the best we can
[40:59] to try to explain things
[41:02] well why can't we call Logos theophany
[41:06] on us why can't we call it this simple
[41:08] terminology so I'm going to say this old
[41:14] because your body spirit and soul
[41:15] brother Ryan said without any of without
[41:18] one of those you're not complete
[41:22] that's what's the difference between the
[41:24] animal
[41:25] and the human
[41:29] right we'll see what we think the
[41:31] difference between an animal and a human
[41:32] is you've got animal life you know flesh
[41:36] whatever Birds what and then you've got
[41:39] a spirit motivating and then we just
[41:42] want to make a a soul as being something
[41:44] sprinkled over that spirit
[41:46] or some nature
[41:49] of that spirit
[41:53] so I told you I quoted that to that man
[41:55] that time where brought around and said
[41:56] the nature of your soul is God if you're
[41:58] born again if not it's of the world he
[42:01] said how can a nature have a nature
[42:04] I don't know one of you argue with him
[42:07] you're not in downtown Fool with It
[42:11] but you see we get in our mind and we
[42:13] think
[42:14] and you'd be surprised how much we still
[42:16] hold on to those things
[42:18] I'm trying my best to get you and I to
[42:21] realize
[42:22] a soul a being is what you are
[42:28] run around them what is a soul
[42:30] he says this to you
[42:33] that's inside
[42:36] well is there something inside of me
[42:43] but what do you think
[42:46] when brother Brandon went beyond the
[42:48] curtain of time remember
[42:52] he was young
[42:56] you remember the people were here
[42:58] but remember you can look back on the
[43:01] bed
[43:02] and see his body
[43:04] and it was still wiggling
[43:10] but remember also there wasn't no babies
[43:13] in heaven
[43:15] beyond the curtain of time there were no
[43:17] babies
[43:21] but when he saw which one was it
[43:24] um Sharon Rose
[43:26] when he saw her not in the situation
[43:29] beyond the curtain of time on that I
[43:30] know the difference okay but he did see
[43:32] her
[43:35] in the last time he seen her was just a
[43:37] few months old
[43:40] one time he said six months one time he
[43:42] says eight months one time he says 18
[43:44] months or something
[43:46] you know he's just human
[43:49] but
[43:51] he said she was a beautiful young girl
[43:55] and you know what
[43:57] she didn't go into all
[43:59] the opening of the seals and all of the
[44:01] great things because she was a child
[44:06] but she told him what was going to take
[44:08] place
[44:09] I'm waiting here on Billy Paul's and
[44:11] he'll be alone
[44:17] but see how real do we think reality
[44:20] really is
[44:22] let me ask you this question
[44:24] do you think that your theophany be in
[44:26] your soul
[44:29] is going to be four foot tall and you're
[44:31] six foot
[44:39] right
[44:40] right
[44:42] I mean
[44:43] here's my theophany is going to look
[44:45] like brother collie
[44:50] to see me beyond the curtain of time
[44:55] and what the prophet would call my soul
[44:57] my theophany my being
[45:00] and talk about his own
[45:02] would I look like brother Colleen he'd
[45:05] look like me
[45:06] no not exactly
[45:10] now I don't think me and brother Carly
[45:12] either one is going to be a little over
[45:14] 200 pounds I said a little over again
[45:19] I don't think so
[45:22] I like the way the prophet described it
[45:25] he said somewhere around you know 18 20.
[45:28] 25 or something years old
[45:31] and and I like that because that
[45:33] signifies the prime
[45:35] but I've seen some people at 18 years
[45:37] old
[45:38] that
[45:40] I know what I mean
[45:43] but they've been a whole lot prettier at
[45:45] 25.
[45:48] you ever noticed that never run talk
[45:50] about his first girlfriend not to tickle
[45:52] and Evil
[45:54] I would leg like a swan arms
[45:59] I describe my wife like that and I'd get
[46:03] breakfast wrote at me
[46:08] well yet he was just a human
[46:11] but he was always trying to describe
[46:13] what he saw
[46:16] right
[46:18] trying to tell us what he
[46:21] himself had experienced
[46:25] and he saw that
[46:27] and he'd come back and tell us
[46:29] we may not have the experience of going
[46:32] over there and coming back
[46:35] you know because it's maybe not made for
[46:37] us
[46:38] and uh I I'm human
[46:42] I believe some people tell about having
[46:44] great ex out of body experiences and and
[46:49] that's that's all I believe in it I'm
[46:51] not wrong I believe in it
[46:53] but
[46:56] I listen to the way they describe what
[46:58] they saw
[47:03] and as they described it I had this out
[47:06] of body experience and I went there and
[47:09] I saw all these men with higher way down
[47:11] on their legs on their waist and time
[47:15] I thought
[47:17] uh that that don't fit
[47:21] it just
[47:23] and then especially after a while they
[47:26] begin to start preaching it like that
[47:29] you know
[47:31] it's okay for men to have long hair
[47:32] because I saw them there were longer
[47:36] I'm going to argue what you saw
[47:39] I'm just going to say you misinterpreted
[47:41] what you saw that'll come out a little
[47:44] bit different all right listen folks try
[47:47] to get you to think
[47:49] how real is actually real
[47:53] how real are you
[47:59] the only way I can know that is by the
[48:01] soul that's within you
[48:03] and you can deceive me with the body you
[48:06] can deceive me by the spirit
[48:09] but you will not deceive me from that
[48:11] soul
[48:17] you know why
[48:20] because if that Soul doesn't follow the
[48:22] word
[48:26] I don't care what you say
[48:31] if it doesn't line up with the word and
[48:33] I've got a quote in here so you'd know
[48:36] that I wouldn't make too much without
[48:40] but what about you
[48:47] no Brother Ray we kid him about
[48:50] being little
[48:52] but he keeps us about being tall
[48:55] so you know
[48:57] what's the disadvantages or advantages
[49:01] what's the problem I mean you know I
[49:04] don't get offended at saying hey you
[49:06] know you're you're tall
[49:10] no problem it doesn't hurt my feelings
[49:13] for somebody to say something like that
[49:15] to me why because I'm just me
[49:19] all right
[49:20] but if we rile up you know and start
[49:22] getting upset
[49:25] about what somebody has said let's just
[49:27] jokingly with us then we need to think
[49:30] that thing over a little bit we've got
[49:31] kind of a a complex on that you know and
[49:34] we shouldn't have that it don't matter
[49:36] where it's big little or whatever
[49:38] you know we should just be ourselves
[49:40] you know I used to kid old brother Fred
[49:43] Hooper most of you know him and uh we'd
[49:45] rag him and he but he just ragged you
[49:48] back and that's the way I liked it me
[49:50] and him always got along good
[49:52] in fellowshipping you know because then
[49:54] you know and he he'd do something about
[49:56] what he's doing because he always
[49:58] brother colleague in a minute he always
[50:00] had the biggest hammer
[50:02] was up here working on the church
[50:05] and you know instead of a little claw
[50:07] hammer
[50:09] you know a regular
[50:10] top Carpenter's hand handled I mean you
[50:14] know the lint
[50:15] he had one about that long
[50:18] and buds you better not try to draw
[50:19] nails with him either
[50:21] because he he could do it
[50:23] but he also liked a big old gun and he
[50:26] had one that hung down and walked
[50:28] through the woods he'd have to get over
[50:29] the logs rely out on them can win all
[50:33] life about Sin but you know what he made
[50:35] his point
[50:37] don't fool with the old boy he'd work
[50:39] you to death
[50:44] what am I talking about you
[50:47] and what you are
[50:50] I don't need of us trying to be anything
[50:51] other than what we are just be ourselves
[50:55] I don't try to put on any show somewhere
[51:02] I'm just myself
[51:05] I've worked with these brothers they got
[51:07] a right to get up and tell you that I
[51:09] worked with them for years
[51:12] I didn't live no different darn than I
[51:14] do here don't let no dealer here and I
[51:16] did dire
[51:17] because that was just me
[51:20] because that's what me that's my being
[51:24] and I believe God has given me an
[51:26] understanding to to try to express what
[51:30] a real person is
[51:33] all right and but the reason I tried to
[51:36] express it is to see how real he is
[51:41] right now when Abraham saw or excuse me
[51:45] Moses but but Abraham coming over melcha
[51:48] when Moses saw
[51:50] the back part of a man that brought a
[51:52] random call to the theophany
[51:55] all right then what would that be a word
[51:57] body we read this morning
[51:59] all right
[52:01] then when he saw that who did that back
[52:04] part look like
[52:09] I believe it looked like Jesus Christ
[52:12] I believe it looked like him when he
[52:14] come in flesh
[52:16] because why would you make it any
[52:17] different
[52:20] I believe the one that came to melt to
[52:22] Abraham that we talked about in the mail
[52:24] Saturday I believe he looked like Jesus
[52:26] Christ
[52:28] because why would you want it something
[52:29] else
[52:32] see if your your soul steps out of your
[52:35] body it's got to go somewhere right
[52:37] sinner or saint
[52:40] borned again or not born again the
[52:43] second you die that Soul leaves that
[52:45] body
[52:47] and it goes somewhere
[52:51] all right what does it look like
[52:58] watch it in a minute when brother
[53:00] Brennan was talking about how that Jesus
[53:02] went down and preached to those that
[53:04] couldn't repent
[53:08] he preached to those that could repent
[53:15] he's not talking about
[53:18] two different degrees of a
[53:20] hail or whatever you want to talk about
[53:22] he's talking about what
[53:25] those who were unrepentant as in the
[53:28] days of the
[53:30] no way don't Rafael
[53:33] and those who could come out of paradise
[53:36] with him
[53:38] why not he had to testify to all of them
[53:43] because of being a witness all right
[53:45] follow that keep that thought
[53:47] and then you begin to see that
[53:51] when it said when brother Randall said
[53:52] like this morning a theophany
[53:55] it's a word body
[53:57] it's a body
[54:01] it's not just a spirit floating around
[54:03] it's a body
[54:05] and what would that body look like
[54:08] you
[54:13] beyond the curtain of time they look so
[54:14] much like the brother random knew his
[54:16] wife
[54:23] come on
[54:27] we'll see the word theophany
[54:31] you don't have that word in your Bible
[54:34] to run our strong concordance or
[54:35] anything off of
[54:37] so Webster gives the definition
[54:40] of a theophany
[54:42] as being a manifestation
[54:45] or appearance of God
[54:49] or like an appearance of God to man
[54:53] you know
[54:54] bringing him down to understand
[54:58] Look up the word soul and it'll be the
[55:00] real you
[55:01] run around and say it's you that's on
[55:04] the inside of you
[55:07] but I know see but I just can't see well
[55:12] what is it what size is it what
[55:17] what's wrong with being the size you are
[55:21] I've done Express now I don't think me
[55:23] and brother coli is going to be a little
[55:25] over 200 pound
[55:28] in a theophany
[55:32] that's why I don't think we understand a
[55:34] new birth because when we talk about the
[55:37] person of Jesus Christ coming in you
[55:42] we think this well when I got to New
[55:45] Birth I had to move over a little
[55:46] because God come in and stood over here
[55:48] and I'm standing over here
[55:52] why can't you think about did he just
[55:55] gave you eternal life
[56:02] why can't you think about that or just
[56:04] giving you
[56:05] eternal life
[56:08] then that would be his own life
[56:10] given to you
[56:14] all right but that's quote see the
[56:16] person of Jesus Christ coming and living
[56:18] in Iran this quote right the baptism of
[56:21] the Holy Ghost coming and living in you
[56:22] right
[56:27] but why can't you get the real point of
[56:29] seeing it
[56:33] you don't have to put another person
[56:34] inside of you
[56:38] you just clean up that old fella that's
[56:40] there and get everything out of the way
[56:42] and God gives that old fellow that was
[56:44] our eternal life
[56:49] makes your soul
[56:51] eternal
[56:54] all right
[56:56] but see was God ever real
[57:01] right around him they asked him said
[57:03] did
[57:05] Jesus did God have that body he said
[57:07] yeah
[57:09] he said he came here on Earth and he
[57:12] said he even went to hell
[57:17] in that soul
[57:20] because he said said his body went to
[57:23] the Grave his Spirit went back to God
[57:25] who gave it he said his soul went to
[57:27] hell
[57:29] well now when his soul what the hell was
[57:31] it look like
[57:39] come on that's all I'm trying to get you
[57:41] to think
[57:43] then you realize how real God is
[57:48] and you'll realize eternal life
[57:51] and what it is
[57:54] god uniting with you in your soul to
[57:57] make your soul eternal
[58:01] you see why I fought so hard
[58:04] all of these doctrines you know you came
[58:06] here with eternal life
[58:09] brother Al and them brother calling them
[58:11] was coming back out of the mountains one
[58:12] day you heard me tell about it and this
[58:14] brother in there he he he had that
[58:16] Doctrine
[58:17] and uh I just asked him a simple
[58:19] question I said
[58:21] where was that seed that you're talking
[58:23] about
[58:25] was it in your body your spirit or your
[58:26] soul
[58:29] I'm not gonna answer you
[58:32] well I got to feeling sorry for him
[58:35] because the brothers kind of took it up
[58:37] and began to do a lot of quoting and I
[58:40] believe he'd walked halfway out of the
[58:42] mountain if we'd have stopped
[58:44] but we took him home and he never did
[58:48] want to ride with us again
[58:53] but I got the feeling sorry for him
[58:55] because they were tearing him up with
[58:57] the word but yet he
[58:59] I'm not going to say
[59:01] well if you're not going to say then
[59:05] what do you believe
[59:07] well brother Dale I just can't explain
[59:10] what I believe
[59:16] you came
[59:18] you can't explain what you believe
[59:23] maybe you don't have very much of a
[59:25] believing
[59:27] now you don't have to explain everything
[59:29] in detail we're not
[59:31] but you're to be able to explain a
[59:33] little bit
[59:36] and then you shouldn't get offended if
[59:38] I'd say to you and say well brother Dale
[59:40] when I was born again I cried and I'd
[59:43] say well and I've run around and said a
[59:45] lot of people cried a lot of people
[59:46] didn't cry
[59:47] well are you saying that I didn't get it
[59:50] no you're saying it because the attitude
[59:53] you got
[59:55] you're getting all upset because your
[59:57] attitude
[1:00:00] but think
[1:00:02] what about words like brother Brown was
[1:00:04] saying God's first creation was himself
[1:00:10] when I don't want to do away with all of
[1:00:12] our thinking about the word creation
[1:00:17] we want to start realizing hey wait a
[1:00:19] minute
[1:00:20] the man is trying to explain God coming
[1:00:24] down to work that we can understand him
[1:00:27] and how some idea
[1:00:29] about his eternal supernatural being
[1:00:32] that has
[1:00:34] created all of these things
[1:00:38] and how real he really is
[1:00:45] he says that
[1:00:48] the logos the Son of God back there went
[1:00:52] out of God
[1:00:55] all right
[1:00:57] well did it did something to be here and
[1:00:59] it went out of it
[1:01:02] or was the way he's always described it
[1:01:05] as what
[1:01:06] the same God that's here moved over in
[1:01:09] another form
[1:01:14] that to me is simple
[1:01:19] he said yeah but now you've gone too
[1:01:21] much into Oneness
[1:01:22] I'll be glad to talk to you a little bit
[1:01:24] and let you see where there's wonders or
[1:01:26] not
[1:01:27] because you see you you're thinking
[1:01:29] about Oneness like the old Oneness idea
[1:01:32] I don't think like that about Oneness
[1:01:36] I think it takes Father Son and Holy
[1:01:38] Ghost to make one true and living God
[1:01:44] you can't separate it
[1:01:46] you are Oneness
[1:01:48] there had to be a time he could manifest
[1:01:50] himself as father
[1:01:52] as son
[1:01:53] as Holy Ghost
[1:01:56] and see he couldn't manifest himself as
[1:01:57] Holy Ghost
[1:01:59] when the time that he was manifesting
[1:02:00] himself to the son of God
[1:02:04] he was limited his own self to that
[1:02:06] partner
[1:02:09] you see
[1:02:11] a theophany what is a theophany we think
[1:02:14] about a theophany as in Corinthians
[1:02:16] where it says if we you know
[1:02:20] we die we have one waiting
[1:02:22] and we want to keep going up that way
[1:02:24] with it
[1:02:26] when as I said brother Branham would go
[1:02:28] beyond the curtain of time and he would
[1:02:30] call that a theophany
[1:02:33] and he called out a soul
[1:02:39] he called it a big a person it could be
[1:02:41] felt could be seen
[1:02:44] they could talk they could do all things
[1:02:47] and he's describing
[1:02:51] a person
[1:02:56] what's the problem with that
[1:03:01] what's the problem that that we would
[1:03:04] think about
[1:03:05] his soul
[1:03:08] was preaching to those people in hell
[1:03:17] his soul descended to hell for you and I
[1:03:22] I don't have to go
[1:03:23] right why because he's already been
[1:03:27] and paid the price
[1:03:31] well see the reality of him doing that
[1:03:33] run it over Brothers if you can pick up
[1:03:36] to about number nine
[1:03:37] let's just read a couple
[1:03:42] you know
[1:03:44] the way that I'm trying to bring it
[1:03:52] and look what he brings out about your
[1:03:54] soul
[1:03:55] this is taken from the interview
[1:03:59] when you say you're a Believer and do
[1:04:01] that it shows that there's something
[1:04:02] wrong
[1:04:03] you don't believe you're making out like
[1:04:06] you believe
[1:04:07] you're taking reasonings
[1:04:10] and not taking your Soul's conviction
[1:04:17] are you reading
[1:04:19] because your soul is the part of God
[1:04:22] that's in you
[1:04:25] watch
[1:04:27] that'll agree with God's word being true
[1:04:31] if not you're just take our intellectual
[1:04:39] about it
[1:04:40] does your soul being does it agree with
[1:04:44] the word
[1:04:51] well they keep on agreeing with the word
[1:04:52] I thought that we concluded by
[1:04:55] establishing the fact that that was the
[1:04:57] evidence of the baptism of the Holy
[1:04:59] Ghost or not was whether or not there's
[1:05:01] a spirit that was in us would agree with
[1:05:03] the word
[1:05:06] now how can all of these people all of
[1:05:08] these years that Acclaim even preached
[1:05:10] behind the prophet and then go out and
[1:05:13] say the prophet's wrong
[1:05:16] hmm
[1:05:17] now their souls not agreeing with the
[1:05:19] word
[1:05:23] sure they got a problem right
[1:05:26] right well now brother Dale you're
[1:05:28] thrown off or not not throwing off on
[1:05:29] nobody telling it like it is
[1:05:37] but see we want to try to make it some
[1:05:40] spiritual part
[1:05:43] instead of taking all of the things that
[1:05:47] we have the value of the message of the
[1:05:51] hour
[1:05:52] to be able to study these things in
[1:05:55] relationship to the word of God not from
[1:05:58] our own ideas but from the prophet
[1:06:01] of the day
[1:06:06] when he would say that
[1:06:09] on entombment
[1:06:10] his soul his Spirit his theophany of his
[1:06:15] own being
[1:06:19] you need that one that's number 11 film
[1:06:22] to pull it up
[1:06:24] his soul his the off his Spirit his
[1:06:27] theophany of his own being
[1:06:33] that's true
[1:06:35] may have gave you the wrong ones don't
[1:06:36] entombment
[1:06:40] that's number 11 but it's on entombment
[1:06:42] that's not the one I'm looking for but
[1:06:44] you can take it there it is
[1:06:46] he went and preached to the souls that
[1:06:47] were imprisoned that reprinted not in
[1:06:50] the long suffering of the days of Noah
[1:06:52] his soul his Spirit his theophany of his
[1:06:55] own being went down
[1:06:57] now he could put them all together
[1:07:02] right
[1:07:04] why can't we
[1:07:08] his soul is theophany his Spirit of his
[1:07:11] own being
[1:07:16] his soul was in Hell preaching alive
[1:07:21] let's see back up we're on I've got a
[1:07:24] number off here this reason it's not
[1:07:26] them it was me
[1:07:27] because I changed my notes
[1:07:32] all right
[1:07:34] back up to
[1:07:37] number eight
[1:07:38] let's get number seven and number eight
[1:07:40] unless establish a point
[1:07:43] so go with number seven
[1:07:46] well you and I brought around and says
[1:07:48] on the Oneness there's nothing got a
[1:07:50] soul like a man
[1:07:53] because that's what we are
[1:07:55] now our sacrifice today not only an
[1:07:58] ordinary human being
[1:08:01] but it was God himself that identified
[1:08:03] in flesh here upon the Earth when the
[1:08:05] blood cell broke
[1:08:07] not only did the soul of a man
[1:08:11] or a spirit of a man but God himself
[1:08:19] listen
[1:08:20] who was identified in that man returns
[1:08:24] back upon the Believers
[1:08:26] in The Believer in the baptism of the
[1:08:30] Holy Spirit
[1:08:36] the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:08:39] all right look at the next one
[1:08:42] number eight which is Israel and the
[1:08:44] church
[1:08:45] paragraph 94.
[1:08:49] and look what he said his soul returned
[1:08:52] back in the form of the baptism of the
[1:08:55] holy ghost that comes into ever believer
[1:09:01] well now his soul come into my soul
[1:09:07] now we need to stop right here and
[1:09:08] that's the way off
[1:09:10] I knew when I got to this point I'd
[1:09:12] either have to express it or bypass it
[1:09:14] to pick it up at a later date so let's
[1:09:17] talk about it a little
[1:09:21] what is the new birth
[1:09:25] it's the birth of the word
[1:09:27] where does it take place
[1:09:29] not in your body not in your spirit
[1:09:33] in your soul
[1:09:35] does God come down as you be in the soul
[1:09:38] and him come down and stand in there
[1:09:41] with you
[1:09:45] why do you have to have it done away
[1:09:48] why not think about as I said a moment
[1:09:50] ago
[1:09:51] did he come down and gave you eternal
[1:09:53] life
[1:09:57] he said he sent back the holy sent back
[1:09:59] his soul in the form
[1:10:03] the amorphied
[1:10:07] to worry that he could come down
[1:10:10] and give eternal life
[1:10:12] to our being
[1:10:17] or so not this body and spirit it don't
[1:10:20] work right
[1:10:21] it's that inner being part of you that's
[1:10:23] called a soul
[1:10:27] he doesn't have to come in to dwell and
[1:10:30] say persons together
[1:10:34] he just gives you eternal life
[1:10:37] that is the person of God right
[1:10:41] come on remember we're talking about a
[1:10:43] supernatural God
[1:10:45] we're not talking about some man that
[1:10:48] created a bunch of people and then comes
[1:10:50] down to living a bunch of people
[1:10:52] we're talking about the great Eternal
[1:10:55] God
[1:10:57] that could give today there's over seven
[1:11:00] billion people in the world today that
[1:11:02] he could give every person in the world
[1:11:04] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:11:07] and not run out of God
[1:11:09] brother moat used to make the
[1:11:11] illustration the way we think it's like
[1:11:13] taking an apple cutting it up you give
[1:11:15] out pieces and you give out a while
[1:11:17] you're going to run out of pieces you
[1:11:18] ain't got no more Apple
[1:11:22] but you know what I believe that the
[1:11:25] more he divides himself among the people
[1:11:27] in the New Birth the greater he is
[1:11:30] instead of the Lesser
[1:11:34] he's multiplying himself into many sons
[1:11:38] and daughters of God
[1:11:43] by the new birth
[1:11:45] so he doesn't have to come and live in
[1:11:47] you as we say a person
[1:11:50] is the person of eternal life
[1:11:54] that gives you eternal life
[1:11:58] and then you and God are one together as
[1:12:00] persons a prophet would say
[1:12:02] why because you have the person of
[1:12:05] eternal life
[1:12:07] right I agree with you
[1:12:10] Ophelia back there is talking to me so
[1:12:12] you standing up looking and
[1:12:17] do you understand what I'm trying to get
[1:12:19] out
[1:12:23] like I tried my best to explain
[1:12:27] about the anointing
[1:12:31] that is able to come upon your spirit
[1:12:34] and really baptize your spirit
[1:12:38] without anointing the prophet would say
[1:12:40] but you know what that does not give you
[1:12:42] eternal life
[1:12:46] you can have the genuine baptism of the
[1:12:48] Holy Spirit upon your spirit every day
[1:12:50] of your life and still be lost right
[1:12:53] so it's a lot different from just words
[1:12:58] it's words to bring a revelation
[1:13:03] right
[1:13:07] you know what brother random said about
[1:13:09] a minister not only the gift that he had
[1:13:12] you remember this one
[1:13:14] the only gift a minister has is to break
[1:13:17] the spell that Satan has over your eyes
[1:13:21] to where God can speak to your heart
[1:13:25] right
[1:13:28] that's very close to
[1:13:31] mind convincing isn't it
[1:13:37] but that won't work
[1:13:39] because you mind convinced and you get
[1:13:41] him in with a hot dog you get him out
[1:13:42] with a hamburger somebody come along
[1:13:44] just a little better way of explaining
[1:13:46] things
[1:13:51] but can anybody take away from you what
[1:13:55] God has revealed to you
[1:14:05] because you know I believe in a personal
[1:14:07] God you know that
[1:14:09] that he's to every one of us
[1:14:13] a personal God
[1:14:15] think about it
[1:14:18] his soul his person of his being his
[1:14:22] theophany went to hell well then why
[1:14:24] would we have any trouble then
[1:14:27] when he gets over on the Hebrew Book
[1:14:31] and he says
[1:14:36] your soul is your theophany
[1:14:42] why would anybody want to argue then but
[1:14:44] but it might be often
[1:14:48] okay that's number
[1:14:50] I've got number 12 so check number 10.
[1:14:53] that's what I said I'm the one that's
[1:14:55] got them all check number 10 and see if
[1:14:56] that's what it is paragraph 279 Hebrews
[1:14:59] chapter 2.
[1:15:01] all right
[1:15:03] and when Man became into that body
[1:15:08] now I'll read it next but I was going to
[1:15:11] read Genesis 1 26 and 27.
[1:15:14] so now that's what he's talking about
[1:15:15] right
[1:15:17] and when Man became into that body he
[1:15:19] had control of the fish using the fowl
[1:15:20] remember that's in the spiritual body
[1:15:22] and there was no man to till the soil
[1:15:26] he done made male and female but there
[1:15:28] was no man to till the soil then God
[1:15:30] made man out of the earth dust of the
[1:15:33] earth he gave him their life like a
[1:15:34] chimpanzee and all your bodies made same
[1:15:36] kind of material but look what he said
[1:15:38] but the difference between an animal and
[1:15:41] a man
[1:15:41] God put a soul in a man he didn't put it
[1:15:45] in the animal because the soul that was
[1:15:47] in the man is that theophany
[1:15:51] all right now
[1:15:54] you follow that
[1:15:56] soul is that theophany
[1:16:00] Jesus when he went to hell the prophet
[1:16:03] we gave you his Spirit his soul his
[1:16:06] theophany of in being went to hell
[1:16:11] and brother Brown and went beyond the
[1:16:13] curtain of time
[1:16:16] the angel of the Lord referring to it
[1:16:19] said this is sold under the altar
[1:16:25] and then he'd call that a theophany
[1:16:30] the body that they were in
[1:16:34] so then
[1:16:36] we take the word theophany as just being
[1:16:38] some great big word that means eternal
[1:16:41] life
[1:16:44] what about a sinner
[1:16:46] where's he at today
[1:16:51] all born again believers
[1:16:53] come on go what behind the curtain of
[1:16:55] time right
[1:16:57] as your soul it's your theophany that's
[1:17:00] your being is that your body's in the
[1:17:02] grave your spirit went back to God who
[1:17:04] gave it all right
[1:17:07] and you're there waiting
[1:17:09] where's the sinner
[1:17:16] get the difference in the word theophany
[1:17:18] of one point the word theophany doesn't
[1:17:20] always refer to eternal life
[1:17:23] it refers to a body
[1:17:26] sinner don't have eternal life
[1:17:30] but he's in a body
[1:17:35] is he just a spirit flopping around
[1:17:37] somewhere no no he's in the body
[1:17:40] let's read that
[1:17:42] all right
[1:17:45] let's see if I can find it in my nose
[1:17:55] man we'll have to come back to that in a
[1:17:57] minute
[1:18:03] okay we're on Earth they offney being
[1:18:05] the body
[1:18:07] part okay
[1:18:09] now they won't have this and I'm sure
[1:18:11] but it's on the morning message number
[1:18:13] nine see I gave them two sets I don't
[1:18:16] even know how far we're going this
[1:18:17] evening it's off the message adoption
[1:18:19] and if they can pull that up never who's
[1:18:22] there can get it because he said Paul
[1:18:23] says hey they doing right
[1:18:26] because it does not already hear what
[1:18:28] kind of a body we'll have but we'll have
[1:18:31] a body like his
[1:18:34] what did he ever have that theophany
[1:18:37] body
[1:18:38] I'm a Jesus right he said yes sir when
[1:18:41] he died the Bible said he is a personal
[1:18:43] pronoun again he went to hell and
[1:18:46] preached to the souls that were in
[1:18:48] prison
[1:18:49] hallelujah how did he do it he had
[1:18:52] censored a feeling he had sensitive
[1:18:54] hearing he had sensitive speech he
[1:18:57] preached now once with that same kind of
[1:19:00] body I saw those glorified ones in the
[1:19:04] other night
[1:19:09] so it's easy to follow what kind of a
[1:19:11] body he was in but what was the others
[1:19:14] notified what he's talking about
[1:19:17] he preached to the souls that were in
[1:19:19] hell
[1:19:23] now what's the point
[1:19:27] okay where's it at
[1:19:28] I'll find it coming down to it
[1:19:31] he preached with that same kind of a
[1:19:33] body
[1:19:34] glorified one he preached to the souls
[1:19:37] that were in hell that repented not
[1:19:40] in the long suffering
[1:19:45] are you getting the point
[1:19:47] when he rose you get to the point what
[1:19:50] I'm talking about he preached to those
[1:19:52] who were of what you would call
[1:19:53] repentant
[1:19:55] Christians as we would call them that
[1:19:57] day
[1:20:00] Abraham Sarah
[1:20:03] right
[1:20:05] and he testified to who he was
[1:20:07] but he also preached to the
[1:20:10] one who repented not
[1:20:14] they were there in their home what
[1:20:17] body
[1:20:21] that they lived were living in
[1:20:23] their soul
[1:20:27] they said what the scripture said
[1:20:28] technically the scripture says Spirits
[1:20:31] in prison but you know what your Prophet
[1:20:33] said he said Souls that were in prison
[1:20:35] they repented not in long suffering
[1:20:38] all right
[1:20:39] because her spirits wasn't there
[1:20:43] it's just like I've always tried to tell
[1:20:44] you you take if you don't believe it
[1:20:46] come sit down we'll look at it you take
[1:20:48] the word Spirit you take the word soul
[1:20:50] and run it through your your constraints
[1:20:54] concordance you'll come out with the
[1:20:55] same definition
[1:21:00] so don't get flip-flopped just cause one
[1:21:02] time you might say something brought
[1:21:04] around and wasn't changing that
[1:21:06] it was the souls that were in prison
[1:21:09] who repented not see we think well now
[1:21:12] what it was the the Abraham and him they
[1:21:15] was in their soul we'll go along with
[1:21:17] that but these others was over here in a
[1:21:19] spirit no
[1:21:21] Spirits are never judged
[1:21:25] and don't say the spirit that sent us
[1:21:27] he'll die there's a soul
[1:21:33] those people in hell are there in a real
[1:21:37] body themselves
[1:21:42] which is their soul
[1:21:45] you follow me
[1:21:48] if not right questions I'm trying to
[1:21:50] bring it on around to where we can just
[1:21:52] tie this together and we'll pick it up
[1:21:54] Wednesday as questions and answers
[1:21:59] I believe a sinner
[1:22:01] has a soul don't you
[1:22:06] and I believe when he dies that soul
[1:22:08] will go as it's used in the scripture is
[1:22:10] technically oh you can use it three
[1:22:13] different ways show Gahanna Hades
[1:22:16] which each one of them will refer to the
[1:22:20] grave and then the others will refer to
[1:22:23] a holding place
[1:22:25] you know because that's where they're at
[1:22:29] and Jesus went and preached to those
[1:22:31] sold in prison
[1:22:34] but he didn't bring them out
[1:22:37] but he preached to the ones that we just
[1:22:39] read on Earth that had repented
[1:22:41] the ones that were real genuine people
[1:22:45] you preached to them
[1:22:46] and he was able to bring them out
[1:22:51] right
[1:22:54] why because they were in their soul
[1:22:57] what do you think what's going to happen
[1:22:59] to you the day you die
[1:23:04] I mean it doesn't make you feel good to
[1:23:06] realize that it's not like we used to be
[1:23:10] come on what you used to think about
[1:23:12] dying right
[1:23:15] not much different than anybody else had
[1:23:18] we just kicked the bucket
[1:23:21] and we don't know what it's going to be
[1:23:23] we're just going to float around
[1:23:24] somewhere do something happens in him
[1:23:30] uh-huh
[1:23:33] may I say it this way
[1:23:36] what about the illustrations brother
[1:23:38] Branham gave
[1:23:40] of the old man
[1:23:43] that was struck by the car
[1:23:50] right
[1:23:52] the people saw the card felt at lunch
[1:23:57] but they went back and they couldn't
[1:23:59] find a man
[1:24:05] what about it
[1:24:11] what about it Jocelyn
[1:24:14] he runs into a tree and ain't nobody in
[1:24:16] the carpet him
[1:24:19] but three two or three people in another
[1:24:21] car
[1:24:24] show a man get out of Josh's car and
[1:24:26] walk off
[1:24:28] now I'm sure you'd have problem trying
[1:24:30] to convince them
[1:24:32] that
[1:24:33] they didn't see it
[1:24:37] how close is that world
[1:24:41] brother random gave it this way
[1:24:44] and a slant
[1:24:47] maybe 20 feet away
[1:24:51] right
[1:24:53] what did he mean I don't know
[1:24:57] I don't know what a slant means in Bible
[1:24:59] terminology
[1:25:03] I do know that there are dimensions
[1:25:09] and in that Dimension
[1:25:11] the fourth dimension is like TV
[1:25:14] things like that Supernatural things
[1:25:16] happening Fifth Dimension is the center
[1:25:19] dead
[1:25:22] the sixth dimensioners are sold under
[1:25:24] the altar
[1:25:25] Now where's all of them other people
[1:25:30] where's your foolish virgin
[1:25:34] that's Fearless virgin ever age you
[1:25:35] agree
[1:25:37] where's the foolish version
[1:25:41] don't send them to hell and bring them
[1:25:42] out
[1:25:43] that doesn't work too good
[1:25:45] but don't put them in with a bride that
[1:25:47] don't work too good
[1:25:50] so in that sixth Dimension must be a lot
[1:25:53] of different dimensional situations
[1:26:04] I'm just trying to get you to think
[1:26:06] about God being real
[1:26:07] but brother Dale I've always been taught
[1:26:10] that my
[1:26:12] theophany
[1:26:14] was up you under the sky
[1:26:17] and one of these days I'll go to it
[1:26:22] right
[1:26:26] but I'd like you to read that scripture
[1:26:28] it says if this Earthly Tabernacle
[1:26:31] were dissolved
[1:26:34] we have one waiting
[1:26:36] is it dire if you read it I've got it in
[1:26:38] here you want to find it out of the
[1:26:40] service
[1:26:42] listening to the message
[1:26:44] he's explaining the theophany
[1:26:48] and he says we have not yet the bodies
[1:26:53] we'll pick it up Wednesday and just back
[1:26:54] up a little bit and pick up how we
[1:26:56] bypassed and what took place because too
[1:26:59] late now
[1:27:01] and how we came into the world
[1:27:04] as beings
[1:27:08] and must be born again
[1:27:12] amen that's right do you have a body up
[1:27:15] there
[1:27:16] you know that in God's mind every person
[1:27:19] that will ever receive that love
[1:27:22] of The Headstone as far as his mind is
[1:27:24] concerned they've already received it
[1:27:29] all who
[1:27:33] as far as his mind is concerned
[1:27:36] they've already received it
[1:27:43] brother random talks about now listen
[1:27:48] he talks about when he went beyond the
[1:27:50] curtain of time he talks about leaving
[1:27:52] his body
[1:27:53] and going there
[1:27:57] but remember
[1:27:58] he's a prophet
[1:28:00] God was showing him that
[1:28:04] because a lot of people claim that have
[1:28:06] these out of body experiences
[1:28:09] that doesn't match up
[1:28:11] I'm not going to tell them they didn't
[1:28:13] have one
[1:28:15] I'm just going to ask him where does it
[1:28:17] fit
[1:28:18] in the rest of the word
[1:28:21] you ever heard people talk like this
[1:28:23] bless God I'm so much trinitarian I get
[1:28:26] up to heaven one of these days and if
[1:28:28] they ain't free Thrones I'm leaving
[1:28:33] that's pretty strong here
[1:28:36] you've ever tell you like that
[1:28:38] I believe in three gods
[1:28:41] they're going to be a throne for the
[1:28:42] father and the son and what's wrong
[1:28:43] called if not then I'll be in the wrong
[1:28:46] place
[1:28:48] well I agree with that you're being the
[1:28:51] wrong place
[1:28:57] because I don't believe when we get up
[1:28:58] there it's going to be three Thrones
[1:29:04] I believe there'll be one which is Jesus
[1:29:06] Christ
[1:29:07] come on musicians
[1:29:09] think on these things we'll background a
[1:29:11] little bit Wednesday and take it on to
[1:29:13] where what we bypassed and how we come
[1:29:16] into the world
[1:29:22] and then we'll have questions and
[1:29:24] answers
[1:29:26] but take on these things
[1:29:30] how real
[1:29:32] do you think God is
[1:29:36] and how real do you think your Prophet
[1:29:38] has described you as being
[1:29:47] when there's something in her old days
[1:29:49] we used to wonder what a heaven be like
[1:29:51] oh we'll set up on clouds and play
[1:29:53] Hearts
[1:29:54] you know
[1:29:56] well
[1:29:57] I never was too good at it ain't never
[1:30:00] been too good at it down here
[1:30:02] I did ask the doctor
[1:30:04] when I was kidding with him one day I
[1:30:06] said
[1:30:07] you get this heart straightened out will
[1:30:09] I be able to play a piano
[1:30:12] he said why yes I said we're good
[1:30:14] because I ain't never been able to play
[1:30:15] one yet
[1:30:18] he kind of snarked at me a little bit
[1:30:23] what do you think about it
[1:30:26] you leave here where do you go
[1:30:30] do you go into another body
[1:30:35] you know if you leave this body do you
[1:30:36] go into another body
[1:30:40] or is that Soul leaving out of that body
[1:30:43] what you really are
[1:30:45] and just goes to another dimension
[1:30:49] because that's what your Prophet
[1:30:50] describes or how Jesus when that Soul
[1:30:52] left out of that body
[1:30:54] the body hung there right the spirit
[1:30:57] went back to God who gave it that soul
[1:31:00] that being of what he was
[1:31:03] went to hell
[1:31:09] preach to those people
[1:31:12] what do you think about it let's stand
[1:31:13] what we got 323
[1:31:17] 323 in this fire book anybody have a
[1:31:19] need
[1:31:40] his stripes
[1:31:42] we are here
[1:31:44] and by his blood what about it
[1:31:47] I'm talking about a real God
[1:31:53] I understand feelings
[1:31:56] now some Spirit you feel
[1:32:01] but when he said I'll never leave you
[1:32:04] alone
[1:32:09] thank you
[1:32:11] I'll be with you always
[1:32:18] cause sometimes we grieving
[1:32:21] he has to pull away his presence he
[1:32:25] just pulled away his presence
[1:32:48] foreign
[1:33:10] I do cause you're real well you're not
[1:33:14] inside
[1:33:44] my brother
[1:33:54] he's my savior
[1:34:10] he said
[1:34:16] eternal life Hallelujah
[1:34:39] who said his words say no we can't do it
[1:34:44] right away
[1:35:03] I don't understand
[1:35:17] and he agrees with his words
[1:35:37] get along
[1:35:38] and go put on a pair of pants
[1:35:42] because
[1:35:43] she can't do it
[1:35:48] he said well it don't bother me
[1:35:51] well I just said what he said
[1:35:54] that you can't get a holy ghost to see a
[1:35:55] woman to put on a purple hand
[1:35:57] unless don't be stupid
[1:35:59] I always ask questions I have been you
[1:36:01] know his Pastor you get some sometimes
[1:36:02] that that's so dumb until you you want
[1:36:05] to call them dumb but I try not to
[1:36:08] ask you about a woman wearing pajamas to
[1:36:11] bed
[1:36:12] what's wrong with her wearing pajamas to
[1:36:15] bed
[1:36:18] what's wrong with you going around your
[1:36:20] home will you dress over the top of your
[1:36:23] pajamas now don't run around and say

[1:36:48] Brown was it all right for me to wear
[1:36:49] these undergarments under here and he'd
[1:36:51] probably say yeah cause you don't you're
[1:36:52] gonna freeze to death
[1:36:55] don't bring them outside
[1:36:57] right
[1:36:59] well I don't agree with that well that's
