[6:39] word and then
[6:40] i'll have you all be seated after we
[6:42] read so we're going to read in
[6:43] colossians chapter 2
[6:46] verse 1
[6:47] starting at verse 1.
[6:53] colossians 2 verse 1.
[6:59] the bible says for i would that ye knew
[7:01] what great conflict i have for you
[7:04] and for them at laodicea and for as many
[7:06] as have not seen my face in the flesh
[7:09] that their hearts might be comforted
[7:11] being knit together in love and unto all
[7:14] riches of the full assurance of
[7:16] understanding
[7:18] to the acknowledgement of the mystery of
[7:20] god and of the father and of christ in
[7:23] whom are hid
[7:25] all the treasures of wisdom and
[7:27] knowledge
[7:28] and this i say lest any man should
[7:30] beguile you with enticing words
[7:32] for though i be absent in the flesh yet
[7:35] am i with you in the spirit
[7:38] joying and beholding your your order
[7:41] and in the steadfastness of your faith
[7:43] in christ
[7:45] as you have therefore received christ
[7:47] jesus the lord so walk ye in him
[7:51] rooted and built up
[7:53] built up in him and established in the
[7:56] faith as ye have been taught
[7:58] abounding therein with thanksgiving
[8:01] beware lest any man spoil you through
[8:03] philosophy and vain deceit
[8:05] after the tradition of man
[8:08] after the rudiments of the world
[8:11] and not after christ
[8:13] for in him
[8:15] dwelleth all
[8:17] not some
[8:18] amen all
[8:20] the fullness of the godhead bodily
[8:23] and look what he says here and ye are
[8:25] complete in him

[8:34] the colossians and they're gentiles
[8:37] right
[8:39] how many believe that that god's given
[8:41] us further revelation in this day
[8:44] yet paul was saying that they were
[8:45] complete in him
[8:48] at that time
[8:50] how how about you
[8:53] that's why when satan comes around and
[8:54] he starts talking to you well you know

[12:11] christian way man that picture is

[12:45] evangelistic sermon when i was when i
[12:47] was
[12:48] listening
[12:50] he did an excellent job we appreciate
[12:52] that word brother brother bob amen
[12:56] praise the lord because how many believe
[12:57] that god still heals
[12:59] amen even in this in this moment where
[13:02] where we see so much sickness and so
[13:04] many people dying left and right and
[13:05] just all kinds of chaos amen but
[13:09] but god is still in the healing business
[13:11] amen
[13:12] thank you all for your prayers for us
[13:14] this past weekend um i could say maybe
[13:17] for brother with brother wade as well
[13:19] brother boyd was there as well
[13:21] and uh my family uh sister june i
[13:24] believe the people were definitely
[13:26] helped
[13:27] uh they were and i know that they're
[13:29] listening in right now lord bless you
[13:31] all
[13:32] we love you all and uh
[13:35] just to just to be there in their place
[13:37] and and fellowship with them and and
[13:40] uh be able to answer their their their
[13:42] questions brother wade of course he was
[13:44] he was the one who did most of that and
[13:47] and it just
[13:48] it tied things so perfectly i mean i
[13:50] even i even learned some more things
[13:52] amen some more things were revealed to
[13:54] me
[13:55] and uh
[13:57] you know what struck me the most is that
[13:59] is that
[14:00] they some of them have been believers
[14:02] for for a while now you know
[14:04] but but
[14:06] they they've
[14:08] you can just see it in their heart that
[14:10] they're so in love with christ right now
[14:13] and and it's almost like
[14:15] i almost felt jealous for them
[14:18] you know what i'm saying it's like they
[14:20] are so in love with god right now
[14:23] i mean i i have never seen
[14:26] people
[14:27] watching with a zeal washing our feet
[14:30] and crying like babies as they were
[14:32] there washing our feet and just thanking
[14:34] thanking god and
[14:36] i said lord you know
[14:37] maybe you're just calling us to go back
[14:39] to our first love amen maybe he's using
[14:42] those brethren to do that and and so
[14:44] that really struck me and and they might
[14:46] think you know we went over there to get
[14:48] for them to receive something from us
[14:50] but i got that from them
[14:52] amen
[14:53] that zeal that sometimes because we we
[14:56] think we have it all here and it's
[14:57] another wednesday night another sunday
[14:59] morning another sun as brother bob
[15:01] there's brother wade preaching again but
[15:03] to them it's not that way
[15:06] to them they are really taking
[15:08] everything even going back 15 years from
[15:10] when brother dale was preaching and
[15:12] they're quoting things that brother dale
[15:14] said 15 years ago
[15:17] puts me to shame
[15:19] yeah and they know everybody and they
[15:20] know how many hair
[15:23] brother bob has on his hair and his face
[15:25] and everything
[15:26] [Laughter]
[15:29] so they're paying attention but most
[15:32] importantly they're paying attention to
[15:33] the word and and so they they're praying
[15:36] for us and you just continue to pray for
[15:38] them
[15:38] some of them i believe want to get
[15:40] rebaptized and then and and just
[15:43] and so we just thank god god is working
[15:45] and who knows what will happen from six
[15:47] months to a year from now
[15:49] god is the one that's in control what's
[15:51] most important is that they're in love
[15:53] with christ
[15:54] no matter the situation that they're in
[15:56] if it's drawing them closer to god
[15:58] that's the most important part
[16:00] so be it amen but but uh and just so
[16:04] glad that we were able to be part of
[16:06] that so lord willing they'll be here
[16:07] with us the brethren will be here with
[16:09] us more of them
[16:10] even from last time they'll be here with
[16:13] us in a couple of weeks for the meetings
[16:14] so
[16:16] so we just thank god and thank god for
[16:18] the protection
[16:19] and
[16:20] i know some of you all probably saw a
[16:22] little videos we were sending in through
[16:24] the whatsapp group we were just having
[16:25] fun too
[16:26] i mean we laughed we ate
[16:30] and did a little bit of cutting up as
[16:31] well
[16:33] and brother boyd he's a good sport but
[16:36] we appreciate we appreciate
[16:39] all the other things and and uh just
[16:41] thank god for the fellowship so
[16:44] so we're gonna go ahead and go to the
[16:46] word now and uh just um
[16:49] just a small little thought here and i'm
[16:51] not i'm not going to keep you all along
[16:52] but so walkie in him and we see here
[16:55] that this is a phrase that is in uh that
[16:57] is in verse six
[16:59] um
[17:00] but i just want to go i just want to go
[17:02] verse by verse and if we read here in
[17:03] colossians 2 verse 1 and it says for i
[17:06] would that ye knew what great conflict i
[17:09] have for you and for them at laodicea
[17:12] and for as many as have not seen my face
[17:14] in the flesh you notice how
[17:16] paul was mentioning that how he has such
[17:19] a great conflict such a great love such
[17:21] a great zeal for for the ones that were
[17:23] in laodicea
[17:25] and we know that that was the physical
[17:26] city back then
[17:28] and uh but it's interesting that that
[17:30] we are living in that in that at that
[17:32] time amen and and so we know that that
[17:35] our our our soul amen is not in laodicea
[17:38] and it shouldn't be in laodicea amen we
[17:40] should be living in an eighth day amen
[17:42] uh the bride should be in that eighth
[17:44] day but physically we are still living
[17:47] under the effects of laodicea amen and
[17:50] it pulls on us and it tempts us and it
[17:52] and it draws us but amen god has given
[17:55] us a way to overcome laodicea in this
[17:57] hour
[17:58] god has been the overcomer
[18:01] throughout all the ages and he's still
[18:03] overcoming in this day no matter if his
[18:05] laodicea no matter what age we're living
[18:07] in god is the one that's conquering
[18:09] through his people praise the lord so
[18:12] and we see here that he says for and for
[18:15] them there is for as many as have not
[18:17] seen my face in the flesh because paul's
[18:19] desire was for the people even for the
[18:22] ones that he had not yet met in person
[18:24] he had that love he had that desire for
[18:26] them amen and and saints a christian god
[18:30] called man amen that's what he that's
[18:33] what he desires he desires the the the
[18:36] the to to uh
[18:38] raise up the kingdom of god amen not to
[18:40] lower the kingdom of god not to squash
[18:42] the kingdom of god among
[18:44] within the people or amongst the people
[18:46] amen but it's to lift up the kingdom of
[18:48] god and unfortunately we see that some
[18:51] men they've they come in to lift up
[18:53] themselves and to lift up a ministry or
[18:56] to lift up a certain uh group or a
[18:58] certain uh clan or a certain thing but
[19:02] but amen a true man of god just like
[19:04] paul and man he was about about lifting
[19:07] the people up amen
[19:08] and it's not about you and it's not
[19:10] about me it's about lifting christ up
[19:13] amongst the people so that people can
[19:15] see christ
[19:16] and not see yourself not see me i mean i
[19:19] have nothing to offer but christ has
[19:21] everything to offer amen and if and if i
[19:24] fool with christ then i want people to
[19:26] see christ in me the hope of glory may
[19:28] not not not me but see but see christ
[19:32] praise god
[19:33] amen and we see here in verse two that
[19:35] that their hearts paul says here that
[19:37] their hearts might be comforting
[19:40] being knit
[19:41] being knit together
[19:43] in what
[19:45] in love
[19:47] amen and that love that he's talking
[19:48] about here is not it's not affiliate
[19:50] love but it's agape love
[19:52] amen being knit together in love amen
[19:55] when something is knit together amen
[19:58] then
[19:59] it's hard to break it apart amen
[20:01] when it's knit together in love and it
[20:03] says and unto all riches
[20:06] of the full
[20:07] assurance of understanding praise god
[20:11] he makes a very big uh what he says here
[20:15] understanding is important
[20:17] amen and unto all riches of the full
[20:20] assurance of understanding because
[20:22] saints you won't have full assurance in
[20:24] the word of god if you don't understand
[20:26] it
[20:28] i'm just kind of breaking down these
[20:29] little verses if you don't understand
[20:31] the word of god and if you just read it
[20:33] really quick you'd not get the essence
[20:36] of what christ is trying to tell you so
[20:38] here paul is saying being knit together
[20:41] in love first you got to have love in
[20:42] your life in order to be able to love
[20:45] the word of god
[20:47] because oh because i got to read the
[20:49] word of god i got to read the bible
[20:50] because i have to that there's no love
[20:52] there
[20:53] that love is not connecting you to the
[20:55] word amen so then you won't have the
[20:57] opportunity to obtain all the riches of
[21:00] the full assurance of understanding
[21:05] you know you have to have some you have
[21:07] to understand something in order for
[21:09] that to be revealed to you
[21:11] right
[21:12] revelation just doesn't come without
[21:15] hitting your physical brain first and
[21:17] you unders understanding it first then
[21:19] it's revealed to you
[21:21] someone had to explain to me first what
[21:23] water baptism in the name of the lord
[21:24] jesus christ physically show me in the
[21:27] scriptures where it is oh i understand
[21:30] that that acts uh
[21:32] matthew 28 19 is really what peter is
[21:34] saying in acts 2 2 38 amen and then god
[21:38] reveals that to you
[21:40] amen you've got to have that
[21:42] understanding and so that's what paul is
[21:43] talking about here
[21:45] and those are richest saints that's why
[21:47] it's so important to pay attention to
[21:50] to the minute to the ministry to the
[21:51] preaching of the word
[21:53] because maybe something may not be
[21:54] revealed to you but but but if you pay
[21:56] attention you'll have the opportunity to
[21:58] understand
[22:00] and then god could come down and be able
[22:02] to reveal that to you maybe not right
[22:04] there and then maybe a year from now
[22:07] but if you're not listening
[22:10] there's no opportunity for revelation
[22:12] amen
[22:13] so he's telling the colossians here
[22:15] being knit together in love and unto
[22:18] all riches of the full assurance of
[22:20] understanding my goodness when something
[22:23] just sinks down deep in your heart and
[22:26] it's revealed to you amen that brings
[22:28] full assurance
[22:30] you think the devil would take that away
[22:31] from you can take that away from you he
[22:33] can't
[22:34] you think the devil can take away from
[22:35] me one god
[22:37] when that's fully revealed to you
[22:40] there's no way
[22:41] amen
[22:42] to the acknowledgement of the mystery of
[22:46] god
[22:47] amen and of the father and of christ
[22:51] praise the lord
[22:52] amen to the acknowledgement of the
[22:54] mystery of god
[22:56] and so the mystery of god praise the
[22:58] lord what is the mystery of god
[23:00] amen
[23:01] we know that it's christ in you the hope
[23:03] of glory
[23:04] amen that is the mystery of god praise
[23:06] the lord colossians 1 27 tells us to
[23:08] whom god
[23:10] would make known what is the riches
[23:13] of the glory of this mystery amongst the
[23:15] gentiles
[23:17] praise the lord
[23:18] which is what watch now which is christ
[23:22] in you
[23:24] there wasn't anything big or isn't
[23:26] anything out of the ordinary it's it's
[23:29] christ it's how god
[23:31] manifests himself through you
[23:33] that is the greatest mystery that the
[23:35] world can't understand
[23:38] that jesus christ is living through a
[23:40] bunch of
[23:42] people like you and me
[23:45] amen that fail him just almost every day
[23:49] but if but if if the love of god is in
[23:51] you amen you want to make that you may
[23:53] want to make that uh uh right right away
[23:56] amen
[23:58] you want to repent right away if you
[23:59] fail him amen
[24:01] and so that's what the mystery of god is
[24:03] which is christ in you the hope of glory
[24:07] praise the lord
[24:08] amen the hope that is the hope that we
[24:10] have amen that we are going to get a
[24:12] body change
[24:14] that is the hope that we have that we
[24:16] are going to see the resurrected saints
[24:18] raised amongst us praise the lord
[24:20] amen that is that is the hope that that
[24:23] brings us christ in us the hope of all
[24:26] of all glory
[24:28] amen christ in you the hope of glory
[24:31] something that the world doesn't
[24:33] understand
[24:34] the world is out there artificially
[24:36] trying to obtain eternal life
[24:38] amen they'll never obtain it
[24:41] never that you can't you cannot that you
[24:44] you can't pervert i mean they'll they
[24:46] can try to pervert it but they'll never
[24:48] be able to obtain what's origin from
[24:49] what's from what's original life amen
[24:53] praise the lord
[24:54] now verse 3 colossians chapter 2 verse 3
[24:57] tells us in whom
[24:59] are hid all the treasures of wisdom and
[25:03] knowledge praise the lord
[25:04] amen you want all wisdom
[25:08] look what look what verse two said being
[25:10] knit together in love and unto all
[25:11] riches of the full assurance of
[25:12] understanding to the acknowledgement of
[25:14] the mystery of god and of the father and
[25:17] of christ
[25:18] all right and then in verse three it
[25:19] says in whom are hid all the treasures
[25:22] of wisdom and knowledge
[25:25] amen where's the wisdom and knowledge
[25:27] hidden
[25:29] it's in christ this is in his word
[25:31] praise the lord
[25:32] and so when we get we get sidetracked
[25:35] and we get derailed amen on other on
[25:38] other things we fail to obtain the
[25:40] treasures of that wisdom
[25:42] of that of of of that and of that
[25:44] knowledge
[25:45] amen because we are sidetracked amen
[25:48] and this ties uh this ties directly with
[25:51] what colossians 1 27 tells us the riches
[25:53] of the glory amen and so all those
[25:56] treasures amen were hid in christ
[25:59] when he was here as the son of man
[26:01] praise the lord he was the fullness of
[26:03] the godhead bodily the fullness of the
[26:05] godhead body dwelled in him
[26:07] amen
[26:08] and now saints that that fullness amen
[26:12] we might have it in impartiality but
[26:14] it's the same elements it's the same
[26:18] is the same ingredients praise the lord
[26:20] jesus we might just have a down payment
[26:22] amen but with the down payment we could
[26:24] still drive the car
[26:27] praise the lord
[26:28] the down payment was we were able to get
[26:31] the car out of the lot
[26:33] amen
[26:35] now it's better for you to go and buy
[26:37] the car pay cash ain't that right
[26:39] brother brother brother
[26:42] brother john
[26:43] oh it's wonderful
[26:45] amen but but you know a lot of people
[26:47] can't pay 30 40 50 000 for a vehicle now
[26:51] that's what a a a a
[26:54] mustang two-door mustang costs now just
[26:56] about
[26:58] amen
[27:00] but for some of us it might be better if
[27:02] we just don't even go look at it
[27:06] save up for it like the way our our
[27:08] grandparents used to do then you can get
[27:10] your mustang
[27:13] but we want it and we want it now
[27:16] and we're going to get in debt for it
[27:18] and no matter what we got to do we want
[27:20] to look good for the person at the red
[27:22] light so they could see us
[27:23] and you're never going to see that
[27:25] person ever again
[27:27] you're only there at the red light for
[27:28] like one minute maybe sometimes less
[27:31] you'll never see that person ever again
[27:34] but i looked good
[27:36] man i tell you what when i when i when i
[27:38] got out out from that thinking
[27:41] it helped me save more money
[27:44] it'll help you save more money and it'll
[27:46] help you think less of you
[27:49] and more about god and making sure your
[27:52] car looks really good and and and that's
[27:54] fine it's good you know to make sure
[27:56] your car looks good pay attention you
[27:58] got to make sure it runs right amen
[28:01] but i mean if you're just trying to show
[28:02] off and trying to just look good for
[28:04] somebody at the red light and you're in
[28:06] debt for it
[28:07] that's not real that's not wise that's
[28:09] not part of the treasures of wisdom and
[28:11] knowledge
[28:11] [Laughter]
[28:13] amen praise god well i don't know if
[28:15] somebody may have needed that
[28:18] but now amen now all those treasures
[28:21] that were in christ now he has deposited
[28:23] these same treasures and you and i
[28:26] amen
[28:28] praise the lord this might be just a
[28:29] down payment
[28:31] but it's part of the same treasure
[28:33] it's part of the same source it's part
[28:35] of the same life and it's enough to make
[28:38] this car move out of the lot
[28:41] amen praise the lord jesus
[28:43] in second corinthians it tells us i love
[28:45] this this scripture in second
[28:46] corinthians
[28:47] chapter four verse six it says for god
[28:50] who commanded the light
[28:52] to shine out of darkness
[28:55] hath shined in our hearts to give the
[28:58] light of the knowledge of the glory of
[29:00] god in the face of jesus christ now
[29:03] watch what verse 7 says but we
[29:06] we
[29:07] have this treasure in earthen vessels
[29:12] amen in earth and vessels not heavenly
[29:14] vessels
[29:16] in earth and vessels amen god decided to
[29:20] put those treasures of christ
[29:23] in your vessel
[29:25] in your vessel amen
[29:27] praise the lord jesus i i i may have
[29:29] mentioned sometimes but you know god did
[29:32] not choose amen a big vase from the ming
[29:35] dynasty or the chinese dynasty or
[29:37] something no he chose some common
[29:40] walmart pots
[29:44] that cost very little
[29:47] amen that may not look like
[29:50] let me rephrase that they may not look
[29:53] like much
[29:55] but cost a lot
[29:58] it cost him this much
[30:00] amen
[30:02] it cost it cost him your his life
[30:05] amen
[30:07] but to people other people
[30:09] that's just a plain old walmart pot
[30:12] amen
[30:13] i just set that outside it'll just get
[30:15] all
[30:17] messed up in a year or so
[30:19] amen not if god has something to do with
[30:21] it
[30:22] amen the world may say well he or she
[30:25] you watch her in about a year she ain't
[30:27] gonna be going to church anymore you
[30:29] watch her in about a year she's gonna
[30:31] stop reading the bible she's gonna
[30:33] she's gonna completely backslide not if
[30:35] god has something to do with it
[30:37] when god does the work and god deposits
[30:39] his his treasures in that vessel amen
[30:44] but we have this treasure in earth and
[30:46] vessels when god is the one that's
[30:48] depositing amen you better believe that
[30:50] he's going to have some interest coming
[30:52] out of that
[30:53] amen praise the lord jesus but we have
[30:56] this treasure in earthen vessels that
[30:58] the excellency
[30:59] of the power
[31:01] may be of
[31:02] of you
[31:04] no
[31:05] i think it says maybe of god
[31:08] and not of us amen praise the lord jesus
[31:12] so god deposited his treasures
[31:15] these treasures of wisdom and knowledge
[31:18] amen
[31:19] in you
[31:20] so that he can get the glory
[31:23] amen
[31:24] and not you
[31:26] amen
[31:28] some people may say oh you're just only
[31:30] you you're you're just uh uh uh
[31:33] you're just a know-it-all
[31:35] or you're just trying to be a
[31:36] know-it-all or you think you think
[31:38] you're some sort of professor
[31:40] amen
[31:41] but
[31:42] how it was god that deposited those
[31:44] treasures in me
[31:46] amen
[31:47] and now what god has done makes me want
[31:50] to go to the word
[31:51] and therefore as you're reading the word
[31:53] as brother ryan was
[31:55] talking about on sundays you're reading
[31:56] the word that word is opening up to you
[31:58] even more amen the picture is becoming
[32:01] more and more clear now the cow is not
[32:03] on the tree
[32:05] as you thought it was now it's on the
[32:07] grass
[32:08] amen and what is it eating amen it's
[32:11] eating grass
[32:12] amen and the and everything starts
[32:14] looking uh uh the way it needs to look
[32:16] praise the lord
[32:18] amen verse 4 says and this i say
[32:21] paul's speaking
[32:23] and this i say lest any man should
[32:25] beguile you with enticing words amen
[32:28] so
[32:29] so just as jesus he could not be
[32:31] beguiled and and go contrary
[32:34] and
[32:35] he could not be beguiled like our the
[32:37] first eve was was beguiled amen now i
[32:40] want to point something out here for
[32:42] just a moment saints if eve would have
[32:44] stayed
[32:45] in adam
[32:47] there would have been no opportunity for
[32:49] their there being a a a deception
[32:52] amen if eve would have just stayed
[32:54] fortified in in in adam
[32:57] amen
[32:58] there wouldn't be no opportunity there
[33:00] wouldn't have been no deception amen
[33:03] but eve had to come out praise the lord
[33:06] and and that gave the opportunity for
[33:09] eve to make a decision whether she was
[33:10] going to stay with the word or not
[33:13] amen
[33:14] see if you and i you and i were put here
[33:17] on this earth amen and we were put here
[33:19] with free moral agency
[33:21] amen if we were always in christ jesus
[33:24] if we've never if we were never
[33:25] expressed then of course there wouldn't
[33:27] have been an opportunity for there to be
[33:29] sin
[33:30] from our part amen but god put us in
[33:33] here amen so that we could express him
[33:36] amen but you have to express him through
[33:38] a decision that you have to make
[33:41] and man and the tender the tempter and
[33:43] the enemy will come
[33:45] praise the lord but you have the
[33:46] decision to make am i going to stay with
[33:48] the word or am i going to am i going to
[33:50] be hid behind fortified behind the word
[33:53] of god
[33:54] america's just going to let loose
[33:56] and do whatever amen
[33:59] praise the lord so when eve came out of
[34:01] adam but in adam there would not have
[34:03] been any trouble if she would have just
[34:05] stayed behind fortified behind the word
[34:07] and and so that's why the bible says
[34:09] outside of christ you can do nothing
[34:11] amen outside of christ you are surely
[34:14] going to fall amen that's why jesus said
[34:15] without me
[34:17] you can do nothing
[34:19] praise the lord he is the vine we are
[34:21] the branches and we're connected with
[34:23] him amen then we're going to produce his
[34:25] life
[34:26] praise the lord and philippians 4 13
[34:28] tells us that i can do all things
[34:31] through christ who strengthens me amen
[34:34] all things through christ amen
[34:37] all things that that's not all things
[34:39] you know you're not gonna smoke a
[34:41] cigarette amen through christ who
[34:43] strengthens you
[34:44] you're not gonna you're not gonna do the
[34:47] things of the world through christ who
[34:48] strengthens you amen all things that
[34:50] pertain to life and godliness
[34:52] that's what he's talking about amen
[34:55] that that takes you back to that wisdom
[34:57] and the knowledge which which which paul
[34:59] was talking about in verse three
[35:01] praise the lord for though i be absent
[35:03] in the flesh verse 5
[35:05] yet am i with you in the spirit joining
[35:08] and beholding your order and the
[35:10] steadfastness
[35:12] of your faith in christ amen hear paul
[35:14] he's he's praising the colossians and
[35:17] he's telling them that you've been
[35:18] steadfast now the word steadfast it
[35:21] means that that which has been made firm
[35:24] amen and or we're in a military sense
[35:26] it's a solid front
[35:29] and then when you got a military and
[35:31] they put a solid front amen
[35:34] i'm just thinking of world war ii and
[35:36] those those times amen they got all the
[35:38] sandbags ready they got everything ready
[35:41] to go it's a solid front amen where the
[35:44] enemy cannot easily penetrate
[35:47] praise the lord but when you're front or
[35:48] when you're so when you're front and
[35:50] where your defenses are weak then the
[35:53] enemy has a place to get in
[35:55] praise the lord
[35:57] when it's not weak when it's got places
[35:59] that it
[36:00] uh that are not covered there are not
[36:01] hidden under the blood
[36:03] they're not covered or eradicated by the
[36:05] blood
[36:06] amen then satan always has a finger to
[36:09] point at you
[36:11] amen don't give them that opportunity
[36:14] amen make sure you have that
[36:15] steadfastness amen the steadfastness of
[36:19] your faith
[36:20] in christ amen now paul here the whole
[36:23] time he's talking about in christ in in
[36:27] in amen because the the title is
[36:29] uh walkie in him amen
[36:33] walk ye in him
[36:34] praise the lord
[36:37] now verse six it says as ye have
[36:38] therefore received christ jesus the lord
[36:42] so walk ye in him amen
[36:45] i mean no don't walk next to him
[36:50] a lot of people like to walk with
[36:52] christ amen he
[36:55] that you're going to still be in trouble
[36:57] you're going to still be exposed to the
[36:58] elements
[37:00] amen if you think that just coming to
[37:02] church
[37:03] amen it's going to
[37:05] that you're fine with that and no true
[37:07] heartfelt religion in your heart amen
[37:10] there's going to be there's danger in
[37:11] that
[37:13] amen
[37:14] if you're just going through emotions
[37:16] amen there's danger in that
[37:18] amen but if you're walking if you walk
[37:20] ye in him amen that means you're
[37:23] fortified in him that means you're
[37:25] protected in him praise the lord amen
[37:28] not with him not not behind him not in
[37:30] front of him
[37:31] amen like eve got got ahead of the word
[37:34] amen
[37:35] amen
[37:36] not in front of him amen walking in
[37:38] christ it assures us that wherever he
[37:40] goes you go
[37:43] amen
[37:44] wherever he goes you go wherever the
[37:47] word takes you amen that's where you're
[37:49] going to be
[37:50] amen
[37:51] if the word is there then that's where
[37:53] i'm going to be amen praise the lord
[37:56] outside of christ i can't be part of it
[37:59] amen
[38:00] amen when you're fortified in him amen
[38:03] wherever he turns you turn
[38:05] praise the lord
[38:06] sometimes some people are still stuck
[38:08] back here and years pass by
[38:11] amen and they haven't turned that corner
[38:14] and christ is moving
[38:16] i then christ is revealing his word
[38:19] christ is still speaking amen and he and
[38:21] and he's using a five-fold ministry in
[38:23] this hour to speak to us
[38:25] and some of us don't want to turn
[38:28] some of us just want to stay with what
[38:30] happened in 1960 and so on amen that was
[38:33] great that was wonderful amen but it's
[38:36] time to walk where christ is walking
[38:37] amen
[38:38] where he is that's where i would i just
[38:41] won't follow i'll just be right there in
[38:42] him amen
[38:44] amen i read a quote this this past
[38:46] sunday uh to the to the brothers because
[38:49] brother wade he preached in the morning
[38:50] sunday morning and i preached in the
[38:51] afternoon and uh where we dedicated the
[38:54] the the the building there where they're

[39:40] and so i have experience and i can tell
[39:42] you

[39:52] control of you
[39:53] you think oh i got this i drink the

[41:21] let me tell you i'll just be honest with
[41:23] you hey
[41:24] that influence when you're doing it
[41:26] while you're drinking it feels good
[41:29] that's why people go back to do it
[41:31] but then they forget what happens the
[41:32] next day
[41:36] they hate that part
[41:39] throwing up pizza and breadsticks and
[41:41] stuff the next day
[41:45] and trying to hide it from your parents
[41:49] but then i was like i'll go back out
[41:50] with my friends again
[41:52] the following friday and doing the same
[41:54] thing over and over
[41:56] back in the rut but the way it shakes
[41:58] his head
[42:00] it's not a good feeling amen you are
[42:02] under the influence amen but this is an
[42:04] eternal influence amen there's no
[42:06] hangover afterwards amen
[42:09] and you can just go back to it and it's
[42:11] like going back to your first love amen
[42:14] oh lord jesus come take care of uh meet
[42:17] this need and the lord comes in and
[42:19] meets that need for you and and you just
[42:21] fall in love with him once again amen
[42:23] just like the song i keep falling in
[42:25] love with him over and over over and
[42:28] over again amen and there's no hangover
[42:30] no side effects no you don't even need
[42:32] to drink coffee to sober up
[42:36] my
[42:37] they i i
[42:39] they gave me coffee but it didn't help
[42:43] but thank god amen i don't have to be
[42:46] walking in that anymore under that
[42:48] influence amen and there
[42:50] there is no man amen that is under the
[42:52] influence of drugs or alcohol amen you
[42:55] can tell that they're under the
[42:57] influence of something they're not
[42:58] themselves
[42:59] amen and when you're under the influence
[43:01] of christ amen you could tell that
[43:03] they're you're under an influence of
[43:04] christ
[43:05] amen i i know the the saints up in ohio
[43:08] they're listening in amen i could tell
[43:10] that they were under the influence
[43:12] of christ
[43:14] amen something's happened in their life
[43:16] amen
[43:17] amen and can you can you ask that
[43:19] question
[43:21] do people know that you're under the
[43:22] influence
[43:24] of christ amen are they wondering
[43:28] well i'm not sure if they're under the
[43:30] influence or not
[43:32] amen they're under some influence i can
[43:34] see it
[43:35] i see by the way they dress by the way
[43:37] they come to church they're under an
[43:39] influence but it's not christ
[43:41] amen
[43:43] and we you can tell
[43:45] you can tell
[43:46] because the outside manifests what's
[43:48] inside
[43:50] what's influencing you on the inside
[43:52] amen
[43:53] now where were we rooted and built verse
[43:56] 7.
[43:58] so paul says here in verse 6 as ye have
[44:00] therefore received christ jesus the lord
[44:03] so walk ye in him amen
[44:07] how did you receive christ jesus the
[44:08] lord
[44:10] amen did you receive it in a in a in a
[44:13] in a sad way
[44:15] were you sad that you came to christ
[44:19] or were you sad that that that you heard
[44:22] that message that sermon that night and
[44:25] and it caused you to to want to just
[44:27] repent of your sins
[44:29] and and and come to christ was that a
[44:32] sad thing for you
[44:34] or was that something that was just a
[44:35] glorious thing
[44:37] you felt free you felt free even as it
[44:39] was happening amen and so paul is saying
[44:42] here as ye have therefore received
[44:45] christ
[44:47] christ jesus the lord amen
[44:50] so in that same way walk ye in him
[44:54] in other words do not forget your first
[44:56] love
[44:58] amen don't forget where god brought you
[45:00] from and in saints it's so easy for us
[45:03] to do that
[45:04] as we go living day by day day by day we
[45:07] forget the things that god did for for
[45:10] you in me that caused you to come to him
[45:14] and to love him and to love his word and
[45:16] not just that but to love his people and
[45:18] i know that there's people amen that
[45:20] come that come here that they don't they
[45:22] look like they don't even love you
[45:26] but you got to still love them
[45:31] you got to still love him
[45:35] when christ is in you it'll cause you to
[45:37] not just love his word
[45:39] but it will cause you to leave and love
[45:40] his people
[45:42] because his people are part of the word
[45:44] amen
[45:45] praise the lord
[45:48] so walk in him amen walk ye in him verse
[45:52] 7
[45:53] rooted
[45:54] and built up in him
[45:57] see how it's how paul is saying in him
[46:00] walk in him built up in him amen not on
[46:03] him not over him not under him amen in
[46:06] in him amen and established in the faith
[46:11] as ye have been taught
[46:13] abounding therein with thanksgiving
[46:16] abounding amen paul was all about
[46:18] abounding in the word that you receive
[46:21] amen in other words adding on
[46:23] to what you've received abounding amen i
[46:26] mean a house when you're building a
[46:28] house you just don't say you build the
[46:29] foundation and you just say i'm ready to
[46:31] move in no
[46:33] amen you got to abound upon that amen
[46:35] you've got to build upon that you've got
[46:37] to pull that put a roof on it then you
[46:40] can move in amen this house amen that
[46:43] god is building amen
[46:45] god is building a house in each and
[46:47] every one of us
[46:48] amen
[46:49] and so it's got to be word on top of
[46:51] word on top of word on top of word amen
[46:54] it's got to be abounding praise the lord
[46:56] jesus
[46:58] and when you come to a stop
[47:00] amen then then you're not growing
[47:02] there there's something that's happened
[47:04] that has stalled the project
[47:08] you got to see what it is
[47:10] amen you've got to see what it is
[47:15] rooted and built up in him
[47:17] built up in him amen rooted amen
[47:21] and and and
[47:23] what
[47:24] what is a tree
[47:26] that has roots
[47:28] but but it's only about this high
[47:31] it's just a stump
[47:33] but it's got beautiful roots
[47:36] maybe under the ground but it's only a
[47:38] stump
[47:40] it's not worth anything
[47:42] you can't really do anything with that
[47:43] amen
[47:45] but god wants us to be rooted and built
[47:47] up in him amen
[47:49] amen rooted and given fruit praise the
[47:52] lord jesus
[47:53] amen
[47:54] now verse 8 says beware lest any man
[47:57] spoil
[47:58] lead away you
[48:01] through philosophy
[48:02] am i reading that right
[48:04] okay
[48:05] beware lest any man spoil you
[48:08] actually it says beware lest any man
[48:10] spoil you through philosophy
[48:12] and vain deceit
[48:14] after the tradition of man after the
[48:16] rudiments
[48:18] of the world and not after christ amen
[48:23] now that word spoil if you look at if
[48:25] you look at that what that word spoil
[48:26] means um
[48:28] back in the pirate days now we use this
[48:30] word
[48:31] very differently today but it's the word
[48:33] booty
[48:35] and then so in the western world they
[48:37] use that word very differently now but
[48:39] what it originally meant was it was what
[48:41] the pirates carried amen when they went
[48:44] to go loot a ship or they went to loot
[48:46] amen the the the loot i'll just i'll
[48:49] just call it the things they stole
[48:51] it was called the booty
[48:53] amen and so
[48:55] paul says here bewareless any man spoil
[48:58] you amen in other words carry you off as
[49:00] spoils praise the lord because let me
[49:02] tell you satan will use man out there to
[49:04] do that to you
[49:06] if you're not careful
[49:08] if you're not rooted like paul said for
[49:10] you to be rooted and built up
[49:14] amen because sometimes when we put too
[49:17] much too much uh uh confidence in in in
[49:21] in a man
[49:23] amen
[49:24] that man can fail you
[49:27] and if you think that a a man that man
[49:29] won't ever say anything that that might
[49:31] be
[49:32] you know he might not be doing it on
[49:34] purpose but if you everything that he
[49:36] says is an amen
[49:38] and you're not paying attention you're
[49:40] not rooted yourself
[49:41] i mean you could be deceived you could
[49:43] be carried off as booty
[49:45] as a spoil
[49:47] and not
[49:48] amen
[49:50] and fail amen be deceived
[49:53] praise the lord
[49:55] see
[49:56] lead a way you through philosophy and
[49:58] vain to see after the tradition of man
[50:02] after the rudiments of the world and not
[50:04] after christ amen like like paul at the
[50:07] beginning when i was saying a true god
[50:09] called man will always point the people
[50:11] to christ amen
[50:13] always
[50:14] amen but when he when he starts pointing
[50:16] to himself or when he starts pointing to
[50:18] the ministry and to look what god has
[50:20] done through us and and all that
[50:23] that's
[50:24] something's not right there amen
[50:27] he's always pointing the people to
[50:28] christ amen
[50:30] so spoil means to carry off booty or to
[50:32] carry off sports to carry one off as a
[50:35] captive and slave
[50:37] amen to lead away from the truth and
[50:40] subject to one's sway
[50:43] and it's so easy in this day and hour
[50:45] because it sounds good
[50:47] and it feels good as he's saying it
[50:51] i just felt all kinds of shivers as he
[50:53] was saying it
[50:55] amen but it's off the word
[50:58] amen it's off the word
[51:00] i remember one time we were at a at a at
[51:03] a uh in in anderson south carolina
[51:06] i'm not going to mention brothers names
[51:07] but there was a brother that came from
[51:09] out west to preach under a tent there
[51:11] and uh
[51:13] man i'll tell you what his people were
[51:15] just shouting and praising god and and
[51:18] that brother was preaching straight up
[51:20] return ministry
[51:24] and in my mind i'm thinking you know
[51:26] something's not right
[51:27] i was just i i had only come into the
[51:29] message that was in 19 that was in 2001
[51:32] 2002
[51:33] and i had come into the message in 99 so
[51:35] i was young
[51:37] and i had already heard you know about
[51:39] these return ministry doctrines
[51:42] and i'm like
[51:44] something's not right
[51:46] it's like it's like the lord's he checks
[51:48] but i mean everybody else was oh my
[51:50] running across the platform and
[51:52] everything
[51:55] it felt good but it was it was wrong
[51:59] a brother came up to me and tapped me
[52:00] behind the behind on my shoulder and
[52:03] said hey brother come here
[52:04] and uh
[52:06] he said he said understand that uh what
[52:08] they're preaching is not right
[52:12] i said yeah i kind of
[52:14] i kind of feel that the
[52:16] i feel it
[52:22] you know
[52:23] and i've had many opportunities uh
[52:25] different opportunities where we're man
[52:27] i mean it was a sincere man
[52:29] who were trying
[52:30] personally talking to me
[52:33] trying to sway me
[52:35] to go hey listen to such and such a
[52:37] person
[52:39] it's okay that you're still going to
[52:41] church it's okay it's okay that you're
[52:43] listening to brother branham's tapes but
[52:45] uh make sure don't don't neglect from
[52:47] listening to such and such a brother
[52:49] brothers tapes i've had brothers
[52:51] tell me that
[52:53] and i said
[52:54] in my mind i'm thinking listen i just
[52:55] came out of the nomination
[52:58] you can't fool me with that
[53:01] i i did
[53:03] i came out of denomination
[53:05] i mean i've been in all the churches you
[53:07] could think of jehovah's witnesses
[53:09] catholic baptist wesleyan church
[53:12] pentecostals for me to go back to
[53:14] another denomination
[53:16] and i thought i was set free
[53:18] but i'm telling you saints there's
[53:20] denominations in this message
[53:23] big
[53:24] denominations in this message and if
[53:25] you're not rooted in christ you'll
[53:28] easily fall and get deceived by every
[53:31] sway of every man out there and some of
[53:33] them will just like directly will just
[53:35] tell you brother
[53:37] you've got to listen to brother such and
[53:38] such because it happened to
[53:40] me it happened to me
[53:44] so
[53:44] you know sometimes we harp about watch
[53:47] what you listen to be careful what you
[53:49] listen to and some of us get mad about
[53:51] that
[53:52] amen but i've had experience personally
[53:55] to me
[53:56] where if you're not careful what you do
[53:58] listen to you easily sway but just
[54:00] because of the person's influence
[54:03] amen
[54:04] so
[54:05] so we've we've got to be wareless any
[54:07] man's spoiled lead away you through
[54:10] philosophy and vain deceit vain deceit
[54:13] after the tradition of man after the
[54:15] rudiments of the world
[54:17] and not after christ
[54:19] amen
[54:21] now watch
[54:23] watch what paul says here
[54:25] because it's not about what that man or
[54:27] that brother has amen
[54:30] it's about christ for in him who
[54:32] in christ
[54:34] for in christ dwelleth all the fullness
[54:37] all the fullness
[54:38] of the godhead bodily
[54:40] so i don't need the tapes of brother
[54:41] suss and such i don't need that it's all
[54:44] right i'll go online listen to them
[54:46] every now and then that's fine amen but
[54:48] what i need is christ
[54:49] i need the revelation of his word amen
[54:51] maybe that maybe god could use
[54:53] could use that brother to say something
[54:55] to me amen and it'll help me amen it'll
[54:58] lead me to to study that out amen but i
[55:01] can't fully depend on his ministry
[55:03] and think that that's just going to just
[55:05] take me in amen
[55:06] and i'm talking about even a ministry
[55:08] here
[55:09] amen i got to know god for myself i got
[55:12] to study it out for myself
[55:14] praise the lord
[55:16] for in him dwells all the fullness of
[55:19] the godhead bodily amen praise the lord
[55:22] and watch verse 10 and ye are complete
[55:25] in him
[55:26] amen
[55:27] praise the lord which is the head
[55:30] of all principality and power praise the
[55:32] lord how did jesus race when he raised
[55:34] he said all power is given unto me both
[55:37] heaven and earth amen
[55:40] and so i want to be dwelling in that
[55:42] i want to be in that
[55:44] i want to be a man i'm going to dwell in
[55:46] him because in him dwells all the
[55:48] fullness of the godhead bottom
[55:50] amen and so in all the fullness of the
[55:53] godhead bodily amen that's where all the
[55:55] knowledge is stored that's where all the
[55:57] wisdom is stored amen so why do i want
[56:00] to go somewhere else
[56:01] why do i want to look somewhere else
[56:03] amen when it's all in him
[56:07] just as the song says
[56:09] amen
[56:10] it's all in him
[56:12] praise the lord jesus
[56:14] so he as as we were reading there in
[56:16] verse six i believe he says so walking
[56:19] in him now first john 1 7 tells us
[56:22] but if we walk in the light
[56:25] as he is in the light
[56:27] now watch it says he is in the light
[56:31] just pay attention to the way the
[56:32] scripture says things and it all ties in
[56:35] really well but if ye walk in the light
[56:38] amen and when you're walking and man you
[56:41] are walking and you're walking towards a
[56:43] destination
[56:44] amen but if you walk in the light
[56:47] as he is in the light
[56:49] amen
[56:50] we have fellowship one with another amen
[56:53] when you're walking in the word
[56:55] let me just put it plain and simple
[56:59] when you are fellowshipping with god
[57:02] you're going to fellowship with one
[57:04] another
[57:06] right
[57:08] when you are in the word for yourself
[57:10] you're going to want to come to church
[57:15] right
[57:16] but if you walk in the light who is the
[57:18] light
[57:20] jesus christ is the light
[57:22] as he is in the light
[57:24] we have fellowship one with another
[57:27] and
[57:28] it's a conjunction
[57:30] and the blood of jesus christ his son
[57:33] cleanseth cleanseth
[57:35] amen
[57:37] us from all sin now that doesn't do a
[57:41] way that you don't repent there
[57:43] man you still have to get if you make a
[57:45] mistake
[57:46] amen
[57:47] you will you will repent
[57:49] you will make it right before god you
[57:51] will make it right with the person that
[57:53] you failed amen
[57:55] that's you
[57:56] walking in the light
[57:58] see you're walking in the light because
[57:59] you want to be right
[58:01] right
[58:02] amen you're walking in the light as he
[58:04] is in the light because we know that
[58:06] he's right
[58:07] right we know that he's correct
[58:10] amen we have fellowship one with another
[58:13] amen and the blood of jesus christ his
[58:16] son
[58:17] cleanseth us from
[58:18] all sin
[58:20] all all sin amen i should have just
[58:23] capitalized all right
[58:25] oh but i no i i said something yesterday
[58:28] that i shouldn't have said or you know
[58:31] i don't know if he'll do well then
[58:33] it's not going to make you want to come
[58:34] to church then it's going to break
[58:37] fellowship
[58:38] amen it's going to break fellowship with
[58:39] him it's going to break fellowship with
[58:40] the brethren amen but do you want to
[58:42] make it right
[58:44] do you want to be right
[58:46] amen praise the lord that is the
[58:48] question
[58:50] amen now brother brahms says here and
[58:52] we'll finish off with this brother
[58:53] branham says no no creed denomination no
[58:56] pope priest
[58:58] or whatever it is or doctor of divinity

[59:15] it would do
[59:16] no creed can stand
[59:20] around it no nothing can stand around it
[59:23] but light itself and those who walk
[59:26] who will walk in it amen those are the
[59:28] ones who will stand
[59:30] that's jesus christ raised us
[59:33] raised from the dead
[59:35] here manifested himself among us
[59:38] and we walk in him

[59:46] walking and cry in god

[1:16:51] we were talking about that in ohio this
[1:16:53] weekend there's people starving for the
[1:16:55] message of the hour
[1:16:59] you said brother white churches are full
[1:17:02] full of what
[1:17:05] i mean really
[1:17:07] full of ideas full of thoughts
[1:17:10] but there's only there's going to be a
[1:17:11] truth and there's going to be people
[1:17:12] what does the bible tell us that there
[1:17:14] would not be a famine in the land is
[1:17:15] there a famine in the land y'all look
[1:17:17] down at your belly
[1:17:18] ain't no famine in the land not that way
[1:17:21] but there's a famine in the land the
[1:17:23] bible said for hearing what not some of
[1:17:25] the truth
[1:17:26] not part of the truth but all the truth
[1:17:28] you see people falling away i was
[1:17:30] thinking yesterday lord's let this thing
[1:17:32] go a long time
[1:17:34] just to see who's gonna he's gonna let
[1:17:36] you know whether you'll make it or not
[1:17:38] right man he knows whether you're gonna
[1:17:39] make it or not but you see people
[1:17:40] falling away it's just because they
[1:17:42] haven't been taught and they don't have
[1:17:44] a birth
[1:17:45] and that's brother brown said that was
[1:17:47] the most ill-taught subject in the
[1:17:49] message was the new birth so
[1:17:51] that's why we talk about the new birth
[1:17:52] so much around here not just anointing
[1:17:54] not just running and shouting and
[1:17:56] speaking in tongues
[1:17:58] but i want what failed sunday
[1:18:01] i want one fell sunday in that little
[1:18:03] building downstairs where there's about
[1:18:05] 12 or 14 of us that place was just full
[1:18:07] of the love of the lord
[1:18:09] it was a it was just a presence that
[1:18:11] that would almost knock you down and we
[1:18:13] appreciate that because you know what
[1:18:15] you know what that's because of because
[1:18:17] they got a zeal
[1:18:19] they were expecting something they
[1:18:21] weren't expecting to see us
[1:18:23] they were expecting to see something
[1:18:24] from god because we all need help we all
[1:18:26] do every one of us when you walk out
[1:18:28] that door you're gonna need help
[1:18:29] man so we're all we all need help so we
[1:18:31] need to bind together like brother
[1:18:32] louise said in love
[1:18:34] not not not not filial love
[1:18:37] feel love you can get mad at each other
[1:18:39] and it's not then
[1:18:40] no agape love has no feeling
[1:18:43] it just has love
[1:18:45] remember brother brown said faith or
[1:18:46] doubt that's the only thing love is
[1:18:48] faith or doubt
[1:18:49] not that in between stuff and in between
[1:18:51] steps what we working on to get rid of
[1:18:54] all them feelings and emotions that
[1:18:57] that we need to have toward him not
[1:19:00] toward each other as far as being wrong
[1:19:02] so just keep us in prayer we had a good
[1:19:04] time this weekend we've been basking in
[1:19:06] it
[1:19:07] even until even today but um we love you
[1:19:10] with the love of the lord thank you for
