========================================
I'll interject some song in there as I'm talking years ago um work in the fields in slavery that lasted many years after slavery ended I worked in the field with my grandmother when I was 5 years old

from sun up to sun down got a lot of time to sing we see I was kind of busy doing something else I was throwing cotton bowls at my sister I wasn't singing a whole lot I was singing when they got through with me but you know other Tunes but it's a good life but I know what what it is we did do those things all day long 7 years old flying a mu from sun up to sun down and but I'm glad God was able to bring us on and kep Us Alive baby of 13 and you know they call out the Unlucky number and I call it pretty lucky myself I think they save the best of life to bring me into being but so but we appreciate it appreciate the singing really enjoyed those two songs sister remember remember now pray one for another and the Lord would bless each one remember Wade and brother Tim will be flying back this afternoon so remember that remember the fellowship meeting uh brother Jonathan Jones brother Jimmy Gibson's son-in-law will be preaching the morning but the Saturday night service and the Sunday morning service so remember that remember brother Daniel we got to pray for him having to pass him out cough drops while ago but he'll be through with it where he can preach for us on Wednesday the the Lord willing and then remember to pray especially for brother Rocky we're still trying to find out some things to uh brother Lise and them about you know how bad he is and things and just pray that the Lord would would take care of him and all like that and we'll try to be able to send some money that way if we can find out something you know whatever they have need of but just remember because I believe in a Healer don't you amen I believe in a deliverer amen let's pray father we thank you you for everything we ask you to just bless us now in your loving grace as we come to the position of Lord speaking what is laid Upon Our Hearts we pray that you would do the the speaking that you would lead us Lord and make us to be as to word that we have nothing to say of our own but what we would hear you say that we would speak Lord have your way now forgive our sins bless those that are not here remember the sick among us and Lord just we love you and we thank you have your way now in Jesus name amen Matthew 19 and then Romans 7 uh two we forgot to say this morning sister Trudy most of you know they took her to the hospital last was Wednesday and uh they was running through a whole lot of test and everything about you know a problem in her chest and stuff like that and uh but she came through it with fly colors so we appreciate it amen I know she appreciates everybody's prayers and everything and I I really appreciate God for being with her and what 70 what 75 and get a full test of okay so that's good amen Matthew 19 the Pharisees came unto him tempting him and saying unto him is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause and he answered and said unto them have you not read that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female and said for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and they twain shall be one flesh wherefore they are no more twine but one flesh what therefore God hath joined together let not man put aunder they say unto him why did Moses then command to giving a writing of divorcement and to put her away way he sath unto them Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives but from the beginning it was not so and I say unto you whosoever shall put away his wife except it be for fornication and shall marry another commits adultery and who so Marth her which is put away doth commit adultery now let's go to Romans 7 remember the scriptures one the prophet used an invisible Union and we will be studying on that so if you want to study the message invisible Union go through it know you not brethren for I speak to them that know the law as the law hath dominion over man as long as he liveth for the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband as long as he liveth but if the husband be dead she is loose from the law of her husband so if while so then if while her husband liveth she be married to another man she shall be called an adulterous but if her husband be dead she is free from that law so that she is no adulterous though she be married to another man wherefore my brethren when you are come are become dead to the excuse me wherefore my brethren ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ that you should be married to another even to him who is raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit unto God God for when we were in the flesh the Motions of sins which were by the law did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death but now we are delivered from the law that being dead wherein we were held that we should serve in newness of spirit and not in the oldness of the letter you may be seated to the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word now remember he says and not after the letter we don't try to destroy the letter of the word we believe the letter of the word it's not to say that well this is and you know that no no we know the word right so we believe in it and we try to follow it so just you know following in that line and we'll try to get to the point in a minute of what we're talking about but to make sure you understand I want to back up a little bit as we always do in the service prior and tie it all together and and all like that of what we were talking about this morning about the pardon of God you know and you know a pardon is not a pardon unless received is one all right now you say well is there any hope for me all right I was reading this morning sometimes and I looked while ago but I didn't laid them all aside but brother brand was talking about like salvation and things and he was actually stating like that people would say is there any hope he said you're in the church said why would you not be in said you wouldn't be here if it wasn't any hope said you'd be gone said you wouldn't be trying right you wouldn't be trying to serve God if it wouldn't any hope so then there's always hope if we can receive it now that was the whole morning's message right if we can receive it then there There's Hope but if we don't receive it then there is no hope so then what we're the ones that determine we are the ones that determine whether or not God can fulfill his word CU he will not pass over the free moral agency of an individual he will not save you if you don't want to be saved he won't do that because he's God and that's the way he's made it and he gave us all that we could have need of he gave us his word and Vindicated it down through these you know 6,000 years and he sent a prophet in the end time to verify and show to you and I personally in the end time were that we could uh receive it and and walk in the word what else could we need the new birth to put in our soul to teach us what the word is saying the word to be brought and a prophet to make sure that we don't get it mixed up and misunderstand it so what else could we have need of you say well I don't know whether or not it's far me well then it's not far you now I'm sorry that's that's as honest as I can be because that way I'm not playing jokes with you if you don't believe it there's no hope for you there are some people you know that they just can't believe I remember an old man I work you know and they went up to to the Moon you know and everything and he said talking about he said I don't believe he went to the moon said they just went out here in the desert somewhere and done these things see he just couldn't believe it you remember the prophet describing how that the the people would say you know I don't care what you do I I I wouldn't believe for healing he said it's not for you all right then whose fault is it you mean God come down show everything do everything prove everything that he's real and everything's for us and then we won't receive it then whose fault is it see if we can't receive the grace of marriage and divorce then it wasn't for us right that's just as truthful as we if we don't believe in the grace of salvation for the soul it wasn't for us amen but my point has always been one thing is to believe and talk like I did this morning that see we can accept salvation for the soul because we've been taught in our life it was you know meant to be and we supposed to be saved and done but because of something that would sound different as the prophet coming along and speaking to us of the grace of marriage and divorce and then by man's ideas and thoughts upon that we've placed ourselves in a condition of unbelief because we cannot accept what God has said well then it's not God's fault he has done everything I don't know what else he could do do you I mean is anything else he could do well he could come down and speak to me personally right is there any greater thing outside of God speaking literally I mean coming down himself and standing in front of you than a prophet standing here with the word see which would be greater well the word is the word why would we want to argue about anything that God would send unto us and vindicate that the man was a prophet why wouldn't we want to believe it you know and if I can't believe it let me have let me give it to somebody else maybe they can believe it you know and just be on that basis but see a pardon is not a pardon unless received as one that's right now see you can say I believe but then see and notice the way that the prophet I noticed about every statement he would make he said pardon is not a pardon because he was actually probably quoting from what they said but a pardon is not a pardon unless received as one right so that means that you could have the man had the paperwork Amen to be said free right the case that came up they had the paperwork they had it there he could read it but he couldn't believe it was for him well then whose fault is it see God has given us his word and Vindicated what else would we want all right now we're going to start here a little bit and just not go into the invisible Union that much this afternoon but I I want to just talk to you about something that is here in the scriptures now this will be tying together marriage and divorce and still with the grace that we're talking about this morning bringing it together to where we can understand because as I said if we can't believe for salvation for the soul there's no need to worrying about for the body or you know anything else it would be just forget it because there's no need to worrying if we can't believe so the most important thing is whether or not you're born again right amen see now that's the thing that you've got to settle within yourself amen you've got to go before God I did for two years you say well no you're supposed to just believe it well maybe I just couldn't believe it I don't say nothing I'm just telling you what happened for two years I sought after God for the baptism of the Holy Ghost after coming in this message reading and studying and praying and everything I thought I could do to try to get to to a place to receive but you know one day I did and that settled a lot of things but you know I had to overcome a lot of the opposition because see a lot of people believed you couldn't be saved after 63 that was doctrines and ideas of mankind and see how that it's really been the preachers that has blinded the eyes of the people if my eyes and your eyes are blind you know were ever blinded somebody blinded them no they was trying to help us well in the help they were trying a lot of times it blinded us to the truth to where we could see all right but look what your Prophet had to say about this Romans 7 go ahead brother and pull up number one we do a little reading this afternoon maybe not too much but look what he says on the invisible Union paragraph 23 preached in 1965 11:25 now and Romans 7 trusting that you have your Bibles open everywhere now across the country we want to read closely now this message out of here it seems like its own marriage and divorce but it really isn't now watch you to me it's a prophecy for the church in the last days let us read all right then he reads Romans 7 all right now listen to what is he saying this message out of here it seems like it's own marriage and divorce right but really it isn't now we won't get to it this afternoon we will start Lord willing next Sunday afternoon probably so study invisible Union and think about it the prophet says that the invisible Union is a greater portion that's in invisible Union you'll find it it's a greater portion of marriage and divorce now what's a greater portion of anything if marriage and divorce is a portion what is a greater portion if salvation for the soul is a portion then you know I miss my wording you you understand you if married if if salvation for the soul is a portion well then the grace of marriage and divorce would be a greater portion wouldn't it but what about something greater than marriage and divorce that's right I'm giving you that to think on see a greater portion he said all right see then we all may say or some may say I you know well brother Dale I don't have anything about marriage and divorce to get straight I'm I'm pure well wonderful holy and pure that's good wonderful commendable very proud of you well I don't need the grace of marriage and divorce well that's that's fine and I I believe there are people that you know that are there for that that I went through those things in the showing that even like if a man puts his way his wife for committing adultery against him he doesn't need need the grace of marriage and divorce to clear him he's got the Bible but the Bible say she's dead while she's living so that's you know all right but now in doing it we look at these things from the eyes of what we've been taught and we've been taught by mankind the soul can be saved but the body can't so we're going to get a a new body well I don't believe that see I don't I just don't believe that I believe what goes down comes back up Resurrection is not replacement it's not coming back up looking like this it's going to come back up in your young age we've already had the example of Abraham and Sarah and the things coming forth so then if we're going to look at something as a greater portion I was saying you may not need the grace that was there of marriage and divorce but I believe every one of us and I we make it stronger so that you can differ with me all you want I believe the prophet was very happy to find the grace of marriage and divorce when he didn't need it but yet other people needed it but now when he comes invisible Union and that's a greater portion I believe every one of us you and I and the prophet of God himself needed the grace that goes with that right that's what we'll go through and see what because we were all married to organized religion that's right so now that husband somebody's going to be that guy's got to be dead somewhere all right and brother R said God let it die that's an invisible Union you can I can't kill it that's right do all you want to you can't kill it he let it die if you did kill it you'd be a murderer if you done it physically right that's right so what good would it do all right but now think about it we'll get to that part later he said this message it seems like it's on marriage and divorce but it's really not really isn't to me it's a prophecy for the church in the last days now this will be the thought of the service all the way through if we can't find in the Bible the things that we talk of then where did we get it you know they they said about brother brandom it said oh some old hermit up in the mountains is one that told him about uh serpent seed but now I don't think so I believe God done that but that's just a joking way of people saying it or somebody had said that about him you know I believe he found it in the Bible all right now the Bible listen to what I'm saying the Bible is written by mankind and you know it tells of life and death and living and salvation and even tells us about eternity to come in the Bible but what good is I was saying a moment ago is anything that we think we have when it's not word related that's right if you can't find it in the Bible what good is it amen that's your opinion that's right well now we believe that there certain things wouldn't written but it's well go and believe what you want to I I'm just set enough on the Bible like it is to just I think there enough of that I don't have to worry about anything else but see a lot of people in this end time have a lot of ideas and you know they bring the message in many many forms and ways and it's been just about perverted so much until people don't want to hear it because the first thing you do is you go connect connect up to the computer when you say William brandom they'll go to the computer and run it in and the first thing you get is a pop up of all of these people telling you how wrong wrong he were the people in the message telling you how wrong the prophet was well if you can correct a prophet I want you to take your shoe off cuz I only to kiss your toe cuz you have to be almighty God I don't mean that as a joke means the truth if you can correct brother brandom then you need to be the one that brought the message I truly need to be listening to you but don't come up with these silly ideas and you know that's that's one thing don't do it uh of doing it but prophecy now that's p r o p h e c y p r o p h e s y is Southern prophecy these prophecies one of them but to give you the definition see p r o p h e s y means like I'm speaking or somebody saying it's the words coming out of the mouth of the person but p o p h e see y if you'll notice it in Revelations 1:3 blessed is he that heareth and readeth the prophecy of this book right all right now prophecy what do you think of when you think of Prophecy see we think of somebody standing up and saying things no yay the Lord said so and so we think that's the what it is no that's that's not what the p o p e c y is that's the p o p e s y if it's of God if it's not it's somebody blab all right but now what is a prophecy see the entire Bible now this why we read Paul and used it there not of the letter we can take the letter of the Bible and prove any thought we want to True take the message prove any thoughts you want to bring but if we take it all and bring it together it'll make a beautiful picture I've always Illustrated it like if you start in Genesis with a white dog and you wind up in Revelations with a spotted or a black dog here or something you think you got it right no you're wrong cuz you changed your color you start with whatever you got to end with it that way amen just because you start with a with a black horse and you wind up in Revelations with a white horse you're not talking about the same thing you've changed on your ways that is not a prophecy prophecy is really taking and setting in order now I'll read this from the definition but it's really taking and setting in order the scriptures until they bring out one beautiful picture all right now if you get two pictures out of it see what you got you got the Antichrist that's why when the prophet see when it come down to the doing of the seals see he was actually and himself as I said now he had to get away from that because he was believing that the white horse rider was the Holy Ghost and teaching that until the seals broke right when the seal broke see then he saw two people read your first seal said here stands a lamb with a book in his hand and out there goes another fell another guy writing off read your seal book see you saw two people when you see two people in the Bible you don't have the revelation of one God you can see one God with many multiple manifestations yes but not two people when you see two people you got the devil on one end of it that ought to be enough to take away a lot of thoughts of people's ideas but it will not why because it ain't going to convert anybody just as I said everybody ain't going to believe everybody ain't going to believe the truth in this message right and swear and die by believing it but a prophecy see we're we're that's what I'm saying we're just think that it's a prophecy is just one thing that's why I've always encouraged you like to read the book of Daniel CU I I love to read it because the Book of Daniel is a constant dreams and things that are being seen but it's the same thing it's not revealing many things it's a continual revealing of the same all right the Book of Revelations is revealing the bride of Christ never is Jesus Christ seen in the Book of Revelations by himself he's always with the bride or in Bride form see that's a prophecy then see if you can take it and tie it together then you're not worried about what somebody says you know you you lay down the prophecy of the Bible of one true and living God and see then when somebody comes along and says yeah but now down there on the River Jordan down there you know when that happened said there was a dove coming down and a you know a voice from heaven and one on the earth and that had to be three right three manifestation yes but not three Gods see there's no Prophecy in the Bible will tie together anything incorrect that's why that the prophets now I'm just trying to get something about a prophecy brother BR said each Prophet would go back and check his message with the prophet previous to him right right why cuz he wanted to keep it correct yes you remember there when one of them you know he said we're going down there and we're going to go Jeremiah one which one of the prophets said we're going to be down there 70 years well see this guy jumps up and oh he's under the anointing he he's the spirit's on him and he didn't deny they was going in prison that's what's so odd he said you'll be back in two years you remember well the prophet said if you you come back in two years and God didn't speak to me well we know what happened he also said you'll be in prison and he wound up right right but you understand yes Prophecies of old came by God himself bringing his word and they prophesied you know they spoke out his words from their lips and it was compiled and made into what we call the Bible all right so then that way one is not contrary to the other what a beautiful picture right so now think about it as we try to get into a point because I want you to see this that this is a prophecy for the church in the last days now I'm going to make my statement and then we'll just try to prove it so then if there's a prophecy in the scriptures and it's tied to to here with his talking of man and wife and Etc in Romans 7 then you realize that brother brandham has said I've got the scriptures on marriage and divorce that was almost a year before he preached it maybe a little more but it's right in there something the Lord even told him he's driving down the road said preach that and lay it aside he said I've got the scriptures he knew in the scriptures how did it lined up and what would be he he even knew in the scriptures that Moses gave a Grace he knew in the scripture that Paul gave a Grace cuz he'll say it on conduct order and do God has made a way for these things before but you see if all of that hadn't been laid in order come on he couldn't have went to the mountain and got the grace all right now that's the whole thought for today think about it had it not been in order right had he not had in order about the one true and living God how would the seals ever broke to him that's right amen are you with me yes they could have never broke to him the seals never come to straighten him out on the godhead that's right he had that right amen he said I preached what Paul preached mhm you remember beyond the curtain of time yes all right so now think about what I'm saying p o p h e see why prophecy is a setting and order to get everything lined up all right and we come and you'll see why the prophet would say it's only for the Believers in this message amen see we come into the message and we somebody when I hear there's marriage and divorce on that book then you go read it you don't know what's going on that's right I don't give anybody a seal book when I first introduce them to the message the first one I take them to is the church age book because the first 10 and something pages is one God serpent seed and brother Ron was a prophet I don't give him a seal book to start with well because won't understand it I told you my experience when I wanted that seal book so bad brother Mo said read this book this this this this this before you do I read every one of them but boy it didn't take me long to get through I read the church age book in about two days or something you know I wanted that seal book cuz that's what I was interested in well when I read the seal book I got a lot of understanding a lot of things was good and clear that open my eyes I could quote you a lot he said but I still had a problem it wasn't opening the way I knew I supposed to so you know what I done I laid the seal book down and went back to the church a book I read and studied and listened to tapes and things and then one day I picked up the seal book and began to read some two years probably later and it began to unfold see a prophecy then would meaning laying in order of scriptures in other words what you getting down to here is a foundation right mhm right that's right all of that that's been said is a foundation that's right that Prophet took all that was said he had the scriptures on there he stood with the foundation through the opening he said it was revealed in the seals he had a foundation and he stood on that and he began to prophesy or how you say the other word he brought God's word down to a reality to you and I right prophecy go ahead with number two brother and listen I see different ones out here today and I'm wondering who's back there now they getting where they swapping out a lot so that's real good look at your strongs number 34 343 94 this is the word prophecy taken from Revelations 13 prophecy and other words a discourse now if I mispronounce these words you you read it discourse emanating is that the way you say it e m every from divine inspiration are declaring see and declaring the purposes of God whether by reproving in AB nishing The wickly Wicked are comforting The Afflicted are revealing things hidden especially by foretelling future events using the New Testament of the utterance of Old Testament prophets remember Paul Paul would take the Old Testament scriptures and bring them over in too see and that's why he was a biggest writer of the New Testament in the New Testament of utterance of the Old Testament prophets of the prediction of the events relating to Christ's Kingdom and its speedy speedy Triumph together with the consolations and admonitions pertaining to it the spirit of Prophecy the Divine mind to which the prophets Prophet what now pretaining to which the prophet faul I want somebody facilitates faculty okay we got it is due of the endowment and speech of the Christian prophets Christian teachers and called prophets the gifts and the utterance of these prophets especially of the predictions of the works of which set apart to teach the gospel will accomplish for the kingdom of Christ other words a bringing forth a telling of what God has in his mind Those Old Testament prophets never spoke their own words they spoke the words of God what a beautiful thing to be able to read through the Bible and find of all of those writers and yet they could keep a continuity to bring it forth into the correct thing that's something in that shows it has to be an almighty God you can't keep any other book doing those things so then what is it now I said a moment ago the prophet then had everything laying in order the seals then broke to the prophet right he had preached it the way it was supposed to be that's why a lot of people believe you know that a lot of people in the message believe that that uh the son of man come in the 63 to straighten out the prophet well I I just can't read that too much I I'm bad at reading but you know I can't read that way I believe you had it in order or it would not have opened now what was not in order no one could have have said it and corrected him about it Clarence Lin said the white horse rider was the Antichrist that was before brother brandham but he wasn't the prophet already are you listening so then what are we dealing with in a prophecy to look at the whole Bible and see if it declares the truth all right then waiting for the end time for it to be comprehended what about God doing that what do you think your job is go to number three what do you think your job is in the end time Christ's mystery of God revealed 63 728 paragraph 203 all these things typed him just in Ty but yet the mystery was hid them men didn't know what they were doing they only knew knew that they were led by the spirit to do so now holding it back in the last days for the great Revelation I want you but expressing it expressing himself in Moses and David and Joseph Elijah and on down through you we could take each one of those prophets and bring their lives out and show that it expressed Jesus Christ perfectly exactly yet never giving his secret and full look at it waiting for it to be made known in the last days as he promised what promised it the entire Bible that's right right watch that in a minute we're going to jump all the way back to Genesis and see if it was promised all right waiting for it to be fully comprehended see before he could express it if he told the whole thing waiting for it to be comprehended would have have done any good if the prophet had have walked out there as he said in conduct order and Doctrine there in ' 64 said the seals were opened in the marriage and divorce was revealed in the seals and he come out there in 64 and questions and answers and and he said I'm going to say to you even when it came the way it did how many comprehended what he was saying waiting for it to be fully understood waiting for it to be brought to a place you said we comprehended that's to mean to understand might not even be in the book one of those words are not even in the English language but yet God was waiting for the end time for somebody to be able to understand he's waiting on you and I right praise God waiting on us to believe it waiting on somebody that would be able to believe it said well I never thought like that well what about it it hasn't been done he said these things couldn't be understood down Through the Ages that God had to wait see now let's watch something as we go back to Genesis and come through the scriptures and watch a prophecy now it might not all be uh let's see let me quote brother brandom he said God can't not bring a revelation and then bring something contrary to that right you familiar with that quote he said because that wouldn't be correct but said he can bring a revelation and then add to that Revelation right he said like for instance in Genesis speaking of the seed of the woman nothing Ang you know he said and later come in full and tell where that was actually going to be at in the wound of Mary that's not added Revelation contrary to the Revelation that is more information about the Revelation bringing it into a Clarity or understanding all right now where did the marriage and divorce problems start all right it started in Genesis right okay now let's go back to Genesis and see what God said about it go ahead and pull up number four and I wonder how many of us has really read the scripture and thought about it that immediately when man had sinned he puts the curse on the snake he says what will happen to the woman he tells what will happen to the man but right in the middle in between the cursing of the snake and what happened to the woman and the man is that scripture right there and you know brother random actually makes the statement one time about it he he said that when Adam and Eve was walking out of the garden with the bloody skins flapping on their legs said God said I'll put enmity between thy seed and the seed of the woman right all right now read that and think about it I'll put init between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed and it shall bruise thy head Thou shalt bruise his heel at Calvary Jesus Christ destroyed the head of Satan you agree but he hit him in the heel in other words he killed him yes he struck his heel see he didn't hit him in the head he hit he hit Satan in the head all right now what do we think about that scripture even with related to go ahead number five that is actually Tak Tak a quote from marriage and divorce and it's coming down through and look what the prophet has to say and he comes down I put imity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and the seed woman's seed and it shall bruise thy head and thou shal bruise his heal the promising coming through the woman the Messiah to redeem all right now that was the first promise in the Bible right writing now not talking about for the foundation world and God and doing in the writings on Earth while mankind that's the first promise of the coming Messiah all right but are we like we were this morning of trying to talk about it do we believe that salvation is for the soul and we can accept that right it's for our souls it'll set us free we preach it for the soul but do we preach Redemption of the body and so yeah my preacher preached about he's talk about yeah what do he preach about it I'm just I'm not throwing off on nobody I'm asking you a question Do We Believe believe that the promise of the Messiah for redeeming or Redemption was for the soul and that only he said well brother D we don't we believe in Redemption we believe what goes down is coming back but really do you when a lot of people in this message believe that you're going to get a new body a lot of people you hear them talking and they leave it open where you can take either way you don't do what you want and they'll say I'm going to get a new body well you don't know whether they mean they going to get another one or what they're going to get right right well the people out there they so well brother so and so said he going to get a new body you see you've left the devil's trap wide open to where he can jump in real quick and pound you to death that's right you might wonder why I'm so adamant about saying it you know not this this this body made new Jesus's body was made new it was made Eternal all right so I believe in a full Plan of Redemption man body world right that's right cuz see my body come out of this world so if my body come out of this world where my body come from got to be made Eternal one day too I believe in an eternal City don't you I believe in an eternal World boy that I don't know about that I don't where it's going to be an eternal World on I think it might be just a good old world well you just choed about half your salvation for your soul in two and didn't know it sorry I happen to think like you think you just cut off parts of your soul and just got it about halfway right you heard the prophet say well in a way that's right is that right brother Gary and what did he say he says no such thing is about in a way he said it's either right or it's wrong right all right now we're either saved or we're lost that's right there's no gray areas you say well I just repented well you're on the way to Salvation all right but think about it what was the first thing that you would think of in reading and and you would think about the I'll put imity between thy seed and the seed of the woman and then read that that was the promise of the Messiah coming this is just a sure very short period after the fall irregardless of how long you want to make it right right and then when Jesus I read that scripture purposely over and over and over and over it's 13 times now we read Matthew where Jesus said from the beginning it wasn't so he goes back to where there's one male and one female right goes back before the fall as quick as the fall came he said I put enmity yes I will bring the Redeemer to restore Adam and Eve is that restoration of the Bride tree is that the future home what is to be restored only salvation for the soul come on are you listening I'll put enmity between thy seed and the SE one I'm going to bring a redeemer on the earth that'll take care of all the things and put you back in the garden just like Adam and Eve was before sin entered the picture now do you believe that right now if you put them back there you don't put them back there with a whole bunch of wives a whole bunch of husbands whole bunch of things now there's the first Prophecy of the coming Messiah but that's all we want to deal with it but to me that was the first prophecy that marriage and divorce was going to be preached if it wasn't never preached where would we be come on if the prophet hadn't brought it where would we be you ever noticed him on the marriage and divorce he said because this is a question in God's word where's the question I Ain worried about the answer I just want to know the question he tells you he said see Jesus when he came on Earth was questioned he was the word that was questioned not a question in God's word he was questioned about the word cuz he was the word right the seat of the woman take you all the way back to the Garden of Eden so it covers the whole plan there's a prophecy remember what I kept saying one go a prophecy is going into the scriptures and coming out of the scriptures of the same thing the seed of the woman was promised sure that would come to Calvary that would bean he would would die and that would mean the soul would be first but then the body has to come into the Life part and whether or not we need the grace come on whether or not we needed the grace we sure need a redeemed body would you agree and to me that would have to be the Plan of Redemption that would be the prophecy all right so you see where I'm starting yes starting in Genesis where where the fall was at not to just talk about salvation for the soul but to be talking about the salvation of all things the Redeemer if you ever noticed this scripture of course I know we read it many times but go ahead number six Joel 2 if you really just read the scriptures as I read this morning and quoted we did out of numbers where Moses said Lord pardon trying to show you the grace of marriage and divorce was spoke of all the way back through there he said Lord pardon these people and what did the Lord say okay I'm going pardon that wasn't what he said he said at Thy word what if Moses had never said that wouldn't have been no pardoning come on that's right read the Bible and pray I remember Fells one time said Don't listen to T unless you you uh pray 30 minutes well I couldn't pray 30 minutes I had to I'm sorry I'm not a prayer Warrior I pray and ask God I he generally answers me and I don't have to worry about it and I'm not throwing off on people that do I'm just not a prayer Warrior there's people that are prayer Warrior to get down and pray for 3 hours I used to pray with some brothers that do that I carried my Bible we'd be out in the woods we praying they pray for two or three hours I'd be S over reading why cuz I done said what I wanted to say does it take you an hour to say Lord bless the people at the church remember everybody's needs take care of everybody Lord Heal Brother Gary heal Brother Dean that's the two every night I call the two two's names every night sister Jean found out she was having problem she's included the rest of you are included yeah but those are the ones that I'm praying that's ones I got on my mind at the time and I do that every night but don't have to pray three hours but see then you think I'm against praying for a long time I didn't say that now you're the liar you know what brother Rand said about him who was it was it moody or which one of them was it that walked into the City and said the city just shut down the thing he said the reason he did said he put these men under the bridge that were Prayer Warriors and said they stayed there praying while he went and preached have you ever said y'all pray for me well what would happen if I got up and said that what would happen now right here in the service I got up here and I said I want all y'all to pray for me right now just pray for me and all y'all started praying out loud I didn't mean that I meant for you to pray the Bible says pray without s ceasing okay listen read the Bible I will restore the years that the Locust have eaten the canker worm caterpillar the Palmer word great Army I know that's where the bug eat down through the church ages I know that and that was to be restored but is that all is that all that he was talking about to be restored let's read the scripture and you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that hath dwelt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed and you shall know that I am in the midst of Israel and that I am the Lord your God and none else and my people shall never be ashamed look what he said and it shall come to pass afterward that I will pour out of my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters prophesy iing of the coming of the Messiah not you know the day of Pentecost right not just the church ages and the doing your old men shall dream dreams and your young men shall see Visions I have a lot of dreams so that means I'm old and also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit now where is he talking about is not that to be fulfilled in a compound meaning that it came at the day of Pentecost but is it not to be that he's to pour out his Spirit upon All Flesh in the last days so now we've jumped a long ways right still with the same scripture and I will show wonders in the heavens and the Earth blood and fire and pillars of smoke look like this day and the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before the great and terrible day of the Lord come and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be delivered right for in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be Deliverance as the Lord has said and in the remnant whom the Lord shall call is not that pointing down here to where we're at so then Joel is not just speaking of the returning of the cankerworm pommer worm Locust the calip pillar eat down in the ages he's not just speaking of pouring out his Spirit upon the day of Pentecost he's speaking of the last days so there's a prophecy that started and comes through 6,000 years amen you understand what I'm saying what I'm trying to do a prophecy Genesis 15 because of the sin of the marriage and divorce problem it would be all the way through the word and we could read it to see this grace and what we're to be which came first Grace or law we say grace came first we really realized that that's true now Grace was way before the law but you really realize what that's saying you said well I thought the law came first well I see that's where you're messing up no Grace was in Abraham he had an unconditional Covenant before you come over to Moses with the writing of the law the law Paul said was added because of transgressions they were was never to have been nothing but Grace it was never to have been a a a king over Israel God was their King there was never to been none of those things Grace was way before the law all right the law was added because mankind could not see what Grace was really saying and it became a book of rules but brother brand said they didn't get what they they thought they got when they got the Ten Commandments he said they got God in letter form we see all we read Thou shalt not kill Thou shalt not steal Thou shalt not commit adultery but if we ever get born again and read it again in a different way we don't read th shall not steal you read I shall not steal changes it don't it just a tone of voice changes the understanding of what it was let's just read a couple and get a little thoughts on this look at number seven go ahead brother this is paragraph 82 and through 84 of the message of Grace preaching 61 80827 the grace was promised in in the Garden of Eden I'll put enmity between thy seed the seed of the woman our's Grace promised right come on Grace to Adam and Eve no where to go no which way to turn and yet Grace made away all right p on down just save reading the grace of God reached over in Noah's time Noah just an ordinary man he and his family because God Noah feared God you believed God you can't fear God without believing how can you fear something you don't believe you've got to fear God Solomon said the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom so it was in the garden we could say it would be in a uh Abel and we could say it would be in Noah all before the law came into existence so let's just jump down a little bit and maybe I can get back to preach let's jump down to number nine brother this sa reading the number eight go on to number nine and look what your Prophet said on the message called a paradox 65017 paragraph 65 the atonement had been made been provided before there was any law Grace was before the law during the law and after the law all right Grace was before the law in the law and after the law Grace was in the garden a promise that he would come forth and bring forth and correct all of our things our problems so then the grace of marriage and divorce was spoke of in Genesis not just the grace of the soul and what about down through the times like I said this morning do we think about some of the things that God has spoken through the prophet to us look at number 10 the token paragraph 317 through 320 the word Joshua means Jehovah savior so does Jesus mean a savior in Joshua when he know his Messengers his Messengers returned back and said I have obeyed your orders remember this was coming in and the the walls of Jordan and there was a woman we found when we played the tapes you know they went in and told her about what is going to happen right we found a woman that believed you remember what she said you remember what Rahab actually said go back and read your Bible she said once you crossed that Red Sea said there was no fight in US now the greatest Fighters that had ever been known the greatest walls to run a chariot race around the tops of them everything but go back and read your Bible they said we didn't have no fight in us they scared to death and hadn't even seen them right she heard about it she believed it you remember what she done her house was on the wall you remember she got her family and everything and look what happened we had told her that all that would come under the red sign back there the token it would token it would mean now I have preached that will you honor it Joshua words I preached that of you I sent you to do it he's paraphrasing like you know to The Messengers Joshua we went down and told her you remember she dropped a red Scarlet thing outside the windows that they crawl down on leftt it out and everything else fell but that wall right right and then when that God honored it the house never shook down and then when Joshua stood there and give the signal to destroy the whole thing we went right straight up and Rahab and all her people set right and all of their possession amen amen all their possession was in the house safely they just stood there and didn't have to look out the window they could read the scripture while the battle was going on brother R has a wonderful way of explaining things on she you come right back watch now and courted now remember this is Rahab the Harlot right I can show you where one time that it says that brother brandham said she got fed up with the things of the day and saw the religions of her day was no good to go with that but listen she come back right back and courted courted the general in the Army and was raised up and come up in Bethlehem and her portion was allotted up there to them and she brought forth she brought forth a famous son that famus son brought forth another famous son and that famous son brought forth another famous son until the great famous son came right back down and on through obeyed and on through Jesse and on down into David that's right Harlot Rahab because she believed The Messer she applied the token listen and her house was saved or she'd perish down there where she would at now she married a Israeli General and from there came down the lineage straight to David there was another lady involved in there that she married a man illegally right and that was basba and basba you remember the wife of URI and David had him killed and all the whole story and can you explain that sure the baby died that was between basba and David but the next baby didn't and the next one didn't and down from Rahab and basheba comes the lineage to Jesus Christ I even know enough of the scriptures so that somebody come along think how smart they are the lineage does not go down to Mary the lineage went down to Joseph but Joseph and Mary were married that brought the lineage to Mary then all right you see I've heard people preach on these women in the Bible and but they make it out to be the wrong kind of a things they make the sex action the things being that you've heard them preach that that Adam in the garden had to grab Eve real quick and place his seed in her to save Eve to keep her from being killed I don't believe that only ask one question one simple question what took took care of Adam and Eve before Adam had relationship with Eve they had to been in the garden for a Time Eve had to be in the garden for a little while 10 seconds would have been plenty enough for God to killed her she was covered by the found for the foundation of the world that's right cuz God knew what she was going to do so you can't just play with scriptures and try to line up things and make it look like a beautiful story I'm not trying to make a beautiful story I'm trying to tell you the truth you mean from Rahab to harlot came the lineage to David to down to Christ yes even from basba in her doing wrong you remember David called down his own condemnation you remember that when Nathan the Prophet come up and told him he you know they had all these and I he took the one he said bring him out here I'll kill he said David You're The Man David thought he had it all covered up didn't he Nathan said thou the man but said David you won't die I've prayed for you what kept David from dying the words of a Prophet come on the words of a prophet kept David from being killed the prophecy who set you who set Rahab free brother R said she Believe The Messengers said she believe the message you know do you understand what I'm doing let me tell you one more time a prophecy runs throughout the Bible and it connects together one scripture after the other one to bring out the same thing when it started in the garden the marriage and divorce situation started in the garden God said I'll put enmity between thy seed and the seed of the woman the promise of the return back to the Garden right not to just bring Salvation for the soul but to promise to bring a redeemer and then down through his word you see people like Rahab thear you better believe a little thing the prophet said in marriage and divorce he said Moses gave a Grace and God counted it righteousness you better believe that he said Paul saw it in his day and said he spoke the word and God counted it righteousness he said how about in the last days amen so we went all the way from Genesis and come into Revelation still reading Matthew 19 where Jesus said from the beginning it wasn't so Prophet said and in the future it will not be so well I'd like to see it get straightened out how that David could be up there with all of his wives and Solomon all his wives and and my neighbor were his three and Paul said I believe it's in Hebrews 7 is that right or is it eight where Paul said no no excuse me let's get it Matthew where he's speaking of the Unix and things but but what the scripture I'm trying to think of I believe it's Paul that said there'll be no married and giving in marriage you remember that we can find it there'll be no married and giving in marriage in heaven to prove my point when brother brandham was standing there and his wife comes running up to him hope he thought she was going to grab him and hug him and say honey he said my precious brother turn walked off and when we get to heaven don't worry about who you're going to be mated with people in the message wonder if Paul had another hi they tried to study the message see brother random said Paul had another hi you know because they going back to the soul if you go back to the soul in one form we can get back to a wonderful place Adam and Eve was one in Soul yes but they were two different people body spirit and soul what made them one in Soul cuz she was in theophany with him right every Born Again believer has the same theophany Soul well I never heard it like that well you hadn't heard much of the message every Born Again believer has the same Soul Genesis 26 and 27 right why because Jesus Christ died and gave his life that was just one soul that Soul comes and lives in you and me it's supposed to live in everybody that makes all of us Christ the beautiful picture to see that the grace of marriage and divorce were spoke of before we ever even started the journey down through the promised of God that a messiah would come and restore all things as we covered in joy and looking at the two worst cases you could just about pick up would be Rahab and see from her did come the lineage naturally speaking not spiritual lineage that's what everybody wants to make some spiritual something that were physical lineages but it did come down to bring the spiritual man Jesus Christ came on Earth he never come from David right he never come from Joseph right Joseph's the only one that come from David and he had nothing to do with the birth of Jesus Christ right right see you want to make spiritual things trying to make something beautiful to make it tantalizing to the feelings of people right who was it back there that you want to say you know that the man took his daughter-in-law you know and she's she preserved a lineage she just preserved a natural lineage Tamar Kar Tamar preserve the natural lineage brother Brown says that was an adulterous act you want that quote he said that was an adulterous act that Tamar and Judah performed now that's okay we can maybe grow with that but what about the next one in the prophecy where brother brandham said an adulterous act can't bring a chosen seed he said adultery can't do that see we want one but we don't want the other we want what we want instead of all the word let make sure I get that quote long ago he said an adulterous that can't be a predestinated seed that's a direct quote you said well I was born in adultery I was born illegitimate what good good now do something about it get saved you found out how dirty he was what about it Church finding out how bad we are is one thing but doing something about it that's right brother R said all babies go to heaven yes we don't quote them do we but you see Church the new New Birth doesn't deal with a physical part of the body so what does it matter if you you know in the message they got two lineages they got a lineage coming from Adam and they got a lineage coming from the Beast if you happen to be the lineage the DNA the the things coming from Adam you can be saved but if you come from the Beast you can't be I wouldn't give a hoot if you could prove I went all the way back to the Beast why cuz that ain't got nothing to do with the new birth the new birth is in the soul you know if the Beast even had a place for the soul he just didn't have them that's right you know that Cain was offered salvation come on oh now I don't believe that well you don't believe the Bible and the prophet get upset with me about it was not Judas told the same thing that Cain was told we thr off on Judas you know how I Stand All Judas done is just point it out here comes Peter along denying and cursing I don't know nothing about him get him out of here I don't want to and God comes down and saves him you know why cuz you know what what happened to David you want to quote brother Bram said Nathan went and told him you won't die he said but David immediately fell on his knees and began to cry out and repent yes Lord and said God looked down and saw David and said all right you're a man after my own heart just had a guy killed to take his wife away from him pregnated a woman it wasn't supposed to and God say you're a man after my own heart I don't think that's exactly the way what God is but when he had that honest and the contrite heart that's what God looks at your goody goodies and my goodies goodies that we didn't do these things that don't have anything to do with it we're just as lost as anybody that's right Prophet said I'd hate to think I come into the world Hebrew series and five minutes ago and had to face God he said because I born in sin sa in iniquity and went forth speaking a lie had no hopes to start with but the promise in the garden amen are you listening the promise in the garden was not just for the soul the promise in the garden was for the entire being of mankind and even a world to be made Eternal one day when are we going to start believing instead of just pity pattern around I was thinking today I thought Lord I wish I could preach like these other preachers can just make it so sweet and just say things that are just so sweet but I just a made that way and I'm sorry you can get you another Pastor anytime you want one I'm just me and that's that's what I stand but there's one thing about it you don't know you know what I'm saying whether you believe it or not you can tell them what I said because I say it enough my wife's always getting on to me said you keep repeating yourself you're getting old well I didn't know that had anything to do with getting old because I repeated myself when I was 20 cuz I found out repetitive things is easier to remember I went to school did you 1 + 1 equals 2 1 + 1 equals 2 I got in a second grade and that poor old teacher she thought we was the dumbest things that was in the world she said we're going to start off 1 + 1 equals 2 and I thought lady we've know that for a whole year right but after a while we found out some things didn't we and we called it horsepower which meant was one horse pulling a buggy or a plow and they just went to the moon and Beyond and they're sending Rockets now out into the atmosphere well on out they still call that horsepower that rocket had so many thousands of thousands of thousands of horsepower 1 + 1 equals 2 brother Dale I've heard you preach marriage and divorce about five times if you hang around five more years I'll preach it again because I do about every four or five years to keep all of us lined up in our things and thinking but this time has been a little bit different amen this time I've tried to spend more time with not just especially the last few services not just quoting because a quote from Brother brandham unless it's revealed is what death in your hand Paul said the letter kth this Bible is death in your hand until it's revealed the grace of marriage and divorce started as quick as the marriage and divorce problem started I'll put enmity between thy seed and the seed of the woman come all the way through the Bible and a prophet picked it up and said it's lined up from Genesis to revelation God said okay come out here on the mountain I got to talk to you when he did he told him about the grace of marriage and divorce is it for me brother Dale if you don't believe it no if you can believe it there's hopes unless your hope this hope I do too let's come on Brothers I do too good thing to be preaching on Mother's Day but I hope you found out to this series at least that you've listened enough to find out that brother Dale is not just against women I'm against you and me both until I started screaming and hollering about it how many of you ever thought about that Paul speaks of a man having a virginity as well as a woman man ain't supposed to just go out and live like the devil and him be okay cuz he's a man he's got a virginity as well as the woman's got one and we could go into a lot of things your Prophet said about that too but I'm choosing to just try to preach Grace now and we will deal in The Invisible Union of a greater portion of marriage and divorce what's a greater portion of marriage and divorce got to go back to Genesis come out of there and bring it through we find out divorces don't work your husband's going to be dead amen but yet he's still right over there the buildings he still out here got to be dead to you and I we can be alive in Christ let's stand together you know I tried to figure out while I was preaching I look around and you know there's three lights but I figured out while ago that the one that's on is the one that's shining so you know that's where you're supposed to be looking well I found out years ago and I'm not a movie star I just read but you know you remember the old days the old days old Roy Rogers and them when they talking they look right straight at the camera they finally told him you're not supposed to be looking at the camera said look off P her away and go around then here goes who was it gatri g we was watching here a while back I love old westerns I'm sorry I do they old ones and old gatri he's going around and then he come back and he look he go around he come back and he look well see you see people now that don't even like the camera is not even there well you know I don't pay no attention to that I don't care what you're looking at all I'm trying to do is preach to you amen and I hope the world can what's hearing the message we'll go home and check it out right amen and see if it's true or not it ain't going to help me none it ain't going to make me nothing but maybe in some way I can help somebody to get free to know the truth go ahead one we got having Jes what anybody have a need can you see Grace Grace is throughout the word even when the law the prophet said it before the law in the law ni Grace because we do not care everything to God thank God he gave my voice where I could at least holler at you I don't mean to do that I just mean to make a point think about it Grace is a person Grace is not a Doctrine or an idea or a quote Grace is Jesus Christ why we read that to start with the grace that is brought to us at the revelation of Jesus Christ I thought the headstone was to come down what crying Grace Grace Amazing Grace Grace must be accepted or else it's a condemnation anybody have a need are we weak with Lord of you know one of these days I'm going to get around and get brave enough I'm going to preach on a god with amnesia I've said that for many years and a God that can't remember what about it aren't you proud of the grace of God set us all for find think about it Grace Grace what could be a greater message on Mother's Day and to tell you mothers how much we appreciate you future mothers and things how much we appreciate you for being what you are CU you know Adam couldn't have done it by yourself you had to have a help meet we only want to lambas and beat on the women because it to fall but just remember Adam had a choice remember the Bible says and Adam all die that's right cuz he had a choice well he done it cuz he loved her was a type of Christ be careful how far you carry that thought just make it fit right don't make him a product of sin to try to save make him the love in his heart and God looked down and seen that love in his heart and he says Adam I've already made the way I've already said there's going to be a savior coming he make a way remember brother Daniel Wiston Just Praise the Lord we bless him father we thank you we love you we just ask you now to go home with us and be with each and every one of us Lord and bless us together in you remember waiting them traveling this afternoon and June going to get them Lord and give them a safe journey home let your love Lord be with each one we love you and we thank you thank you for your grace thank you for a prophecy that we can go back and read the Bible and it ties together from Genesis to revelation we can see that we can stand over here at the end of all things and see that it's still Grace not disgrace and but it's grace Amazing Grace have your way guide us now forgive our sins keep us in Jesus name amen your dismissed my you brother appreciate you
