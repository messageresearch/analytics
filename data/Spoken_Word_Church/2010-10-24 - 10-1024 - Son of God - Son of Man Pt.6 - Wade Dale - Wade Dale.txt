TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and very truthful all the politicians yeah well let's turn to Isaiah 53. I didn't see a room full this morning it's good to have you back out though it's not good to have Jim's backs out so I'm not going to say that it's not good to have her back out couldn't have all of you back out no he was gone I've been in Mississippi since Thursday so I don't blame me but anyway Isaiah 53 last week we were talking a little bit about um the scripture here showing who this person that we're discussing how he has developed in Isaiah 53 Isaiah is truly speaking of Jesus Christ the son of man but he also ends up showing that the one that really the one that paid the price was the soul of almighty God the body was the sacrifice the body was the one to look at like the lamb but in the Old Testament the lamb would die and that life would go out of the lamb but that life couldn't do anything to help the human because human life and animal life can't coincide brother Branham said animals have a spirit that they can move and breathe and and be be held by nature and and be influenced by nature but the same bird that built that built a nest before the ark that same Bird's building the same nest now after four or five thousand years they've not evolved because they don't have a soul they don't have an intelligence to do things better but man has that intelligence and in Genesis 3 God said look uh in other words animal blood's not going to do it I'm gonna have to come do it see to the woman I'm gonna have to come and be the one to make the ultimate sacrifice the ultimate sacrifice you say well what about the body well now in Paul's writings Paul said though I give my body to be burned in other words that doesn't make any difference it's the soul is what matters right but now remember one thing whatever the soul is the outside person is going to act like that okay so it's not going to be a different you're not going to be clean inside and dirty outside or vice versa you're not going to be clean inside and dirty outside or by our our dirty inside and then that you can act clean but somewhere down down the road you're just going to catch up with him but this person here in verse four and all through here that was the man Jesus Christ Jesus that came to Earth the son of man the one that came to give his life that body was bruised broken not broken but bruised um striped for our healing for our for our example but the real part the body of Jesus after 72 hours if that Soul had not come back into that body that body would have rotted and died I mean it was dead but it would have rotted and went away right just like man has done for a year millions and years even Lazarus Lazarus was raised from the dead but Lazarus one day died and that Soul left that body and somewhere in the ground as Lazarus body on this Earth somewhere that it just went away back to the dust that he came from because you know God told him said from dust you come from dust you'll return but the soul lives on and that's why that Isaiah comes to this part what we were talking about last Sunday verse in verse 8 he was cut out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people would be stricken I lend you this human mortal man was going to go through some horrible times he was going to go through some things that probably you and I couldn't stand but it was not going to be that he gave his body a sacrifice that's what he did but the soul had to come back into that body to prove who he was to prove that that eternal life come back into that body quickened or changed that mortal body there's the proof that he was almighty god brother Brown said he said the resurrection proved that he was God because Balaam could do signs and wonders there could be many things they'll look at kaifa said there in the in the New Testament when um Nicodemus came to him and there were some of the Pharisees talked about Jesus and he said in other words he said hey there was a guy come through here one time remember and led 400 out in the desert and he had this big following and we never heard from him anymore said if this guy's the same way said it won't matter but if he is if it's of God you can't fight against it which was very much wisdom on gamalia's part and and uh and Nicodemus was pardon brother Brown said they'd be giving eternal life for that for standing up in other words he was telling them said look if this is a God why are you fighting it right but the only proof of that is either what happened was when Jesus Resurrected not even the disciples believed it right not even the disciples believe it so so confused and all them and the Roman generals they were like hey let's make up this story that his body was stolen and taken away and and he really didn't die and let's formulate this story and that story still stands in Tradition now right 4 000 years later it still stands as tradition saying that this man couldn't come because listen people we know as far as as intellectual people and even people one nine and a half cents the old saying goes that if a man is dead and buried and gone and was beat the way he was and then all of a sudden three days later you saw that same man standing and he would disappear and walk through the wall and do all these things Yeti would eat and he was with him for 30 or 40 days so they saw him do a lot of human things right I don't think he did as many human things as he did before you know as far as having to eat having to to uh you know go to the bathroom just be honest but he was in a glorified condition but they saw a human body that was solid because they probably had their own idea like brother Branham did he said I really thought that we would just when we died we would just float around on a cloud and brother now would Float by remember he said brother never Float by he said but I couldn't shake his hand because he was thinking of a ghost right a spirit a spook like you know Casper the Friendly Ghost if you want room or whatever but that's not true that soul that this Soul right here went to hell and paid the price for you that was an absolute that was God right that was God in theophany form but he was in a body he didn't go down there as a as a pulsating um light right right he went down there as God the devil recognized him because he said you know brother Brown paraphrase and said I got you now you know you're down here so he recognized who he was he knew the presence hey the devil is the anointed cherub he knows when the presence of God's coming that's why he gets in front of me and you when God gets ready to do something the devil will try to cut that offline he's the anointed cherub he knows that anointing is coming and he's going to try to cut it off that's right all right man isn't that true you try to do something for God and watch watch The Devil take over or try to take over but that's what happened in hell he went to hell and paid the price in other words he looked the devil straight in the eye and said I'm in other words paraphrasing he said look I'm going back up and I'm going to get in that body that I lived on earth then that you didn't believe was the son of God because he said if you be the son of God make these stones in the bread if you be the Son of God right see he really didn't know and Satan don't know I mean there's certain things he don't understand or he'd be our brother he can talk about God like we do right there's certain things that God has just absolutely uh Satan doesn't have the mind of God right we have the mind of God so we can comprehend what God has given us Satan can't comprehend that and that's what he hates he's trying to kill me and you he's trying to get us to slip up and and trying to get us to say that we're not saved and trying to get us to say we're not bride and we're not filled with the Holy Ghost he's trying his best because if he can get us he's got everybody else in the whole wide world that's right that's why the prophet said his guns are trained on this end time bride because he knows he ain't a dumb and he he knows there ain't no more Church ages he can read the Bible he was standing there when the Bible would roll right so he knows there's no more Church agent that's right he's just trying to get up enough Force to disbelieve I mean he disbelieves the word of God he's just trying to give up enough Force over but this man went down to Hell and theophany form well who was that Son of God that's right the Creator God the one that was before the foundation in the world the one that said let there be the one that come all the way down Jehovah all the seven compound names those are names but his name was Jesus see it wasn't revealed until the New Testament came out and an angel told Mary and then Mary spoke it on human lips and it became the truth Son of God there's many jesuses there's many Jesus's today we got plenty of Jesus working for us you know and which in English is Jesus that's right but this son of God is the one that went down to to give his life because the Bible said he gave his soul a ransom so if if somebody stole you know cooked June and and held her they'd want something for if they were going to hold her for a ransom they'd want something for it right you still a rich kids you know a rich man's child you holding for ransom so what do you want you want payment to get him back so Satan had dibs on our body he had dibs on the earth because the Lord said I can't strive with man anymore in other words I can't come down in the cool evening like I did with Adam and Eve because you've sinned and you've made a gap for a division but I'm going to come back at the seat of the woman which he did and then that seed of the woman in that seat of the woman was many seeds it's not one it's not many seeds like we think of many seeds as in human beings but the bottle says one seed which is Christ so that one seed Christ went to hell paid the price and guess what you and I were in that body right if you're born again today if you're not you weren't right that's why if you don't have Christ in your soul you got another trip to hell to go you got a trip to hell to go all right the ones that are already Born Again has already been to Hell right we were there in him right so what did he do to the devil he he figuratively there's not a set of keys to death in hell right but a key is an interim there's a way to get in right it doesn't matter you have that door there and say well I own that door and I own everything behind it unless you got a key to get in you can't get through the door but if you got the kids the easiest thing in the world to stick that thing in there and listen to those tumblers click click click door unlocked so Jesus picked up the keys of death and Hell from Satan what do you do he took the ability this is what happened to Calvary he took the ability of Satan to get you away from him you say well why didn't it stop right then it works on both ends right we got a part to do it yes sir it's like I said about the senator he voted God voted for you the devil voted against you now who swings the vote you do it's either two to one over here or two to one over here right and you think that's simple but that's exactly what it is you took God's plan and said I'll take it I'll take the way with the Lord despised you I've started with Jesus and I'm going through or you can say like brother round said the other day I saw him or listening to him um in the uh 1954 series he said if you know I take every Spirit here under my control for the glory of God for the glory of God and uh he said now if you say this is the spirit of the devil he said tonight you'll get the devil's reward but if you say it's the spirit of God he said tonight you'll get God's reward that's right so see there's your vote God was there to heal everybody in the building but if they took it as a different Spirit or another spirit they're not gonna get anything right so when God went to hell and paid the price as brother random said kick Satan over into the into the pit and took the keys and brought him up with him well now when he resurrected he said all power having a nurse been given unto me and then I thought in John 14 he said that whatever I'll do you'll do so who's got the keys to death and how you and I do this right you and I now have the keys to death in hell all right because um let's just put it simple God don't need them we need them we need to realize he gave them to us because he don't need them he died in that flesh one time for all the Bible says and that's all he's got to die and the soul never died because it's Eternal but that Soul come back into me and you and connected as a believer and now you can't die so you do have the keys to death and hell you say oh but we'll put we've been putting them in the ground they put Jesus in the ground right but one day there's something going to strike the Earth to where that there's got to be a group of people that won't die simply because they somebody has to call the Resurrection The Resurrection has to be called by live people that's right can't be called by dead people it has to be called by people that are alive we which are alive and remain Paul says right to the coming of the Lord and that word remain if you'll look that word remain up it's a pretty good word to look up he didn't say we but you're alive he said we which are alive and remain shall be caught up to meet the Lord in the air well see he come back through here and he said he gave his soul verse 10 and it pleased the Lord approves him he has put into grief when thou shalt make his soul and offering for sin in other words Jesus went to hell and said Satan from now on I'll cover every one of my children everybody that believes on me everybody that loves me I'm going to protect them you can do whatever you want to to the body because you still have claim on that body from back in the beginning when he said serpent told the serpent he'll eat dust for the rest of his life well that's what he's doing he's eating our dust serpents don't eat dust don't eat dirt he was telling the serpent he said hey you can have their bodies remember brother Brown said that he's a squatter he's a temporary squatter he's on our property that's not what's supposed to happen Adam would have become Eternal in his body even he would have went through a change because look whatever happened in the Garden of Eden spares 6 000 years or whatever it's what's happening it's what's going to happen now right Adam let's just put it this way Adam and Eve the the Christ and his bride were going to bring forth children to live on this Earth Eternal in Body Spirit and soul in a Garden of Eden condition where the where the animals didn't you know didn't look at you as dinner or the snakes didn't bite you and all those things well guess what that's exactly what happened when God said I'll put enmity in other words he said I'm going to withdraw myself from man like I wanted to but when I come I'm going to put it right back together like it's supposed to been right which will be the second Adam and the second bride which would be Christ in this church doing what birthing children Sons and Daughters of God birthing children through the through the church ages seven Church ages all right birthing children just like they should have been except Satan had has got dibbed on this flesh body because now we're looking all getting older so the effects of the curse are still with us but one day that the fact that the curse is going to be over and we're going to be standing back in the Garden of Eden back where the animals eat grass back where we don't have to eat if we don't want to but we eat because we love to and we want to drink the water and and you know and we'll have a bride right it'll be crushed in this bride just like it was before but just like because like I said Redemption is not dropping even dropping this and picking it up and putting it over here no you got to restore this back to its original condition which is right here I mean God said I will restore he didn't say I'll restore Parkway he said I'll restore it back to where it was that's why brother Brandon can stand and say he said everything was in the Garden of Eden right and we're going back to the Garden of Eden right back to the Garden of Eden all right so that's what this happened at in a stage where he had to take those keys away from Satan to start birthing his children he had to come back and pick that body up and see Lazarus body was dead in the grave he had a soul that Soul was out of that body for four days when that Soul came back in that body he was the same Lazarus it didn't Quicken his mortal body
