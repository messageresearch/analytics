today russia amen iran iraq america whatever every nation is wanting power but paul said that i may know him in the power of his resurrection i got thinking about that word power which is the same greek word there as it is in acts 1 dunamis and i got to thinking about that to know him that can not only save us sanctify us fill us with the holy ghost cleanse us of our habits praise the lord not only to save sanctify fill us with the holy ghost but to seal us until our destination not only that but able to reveal to us what he wants in this age for us praise god amen to make that a great hour and i like what brother brother sam said amen i want to be happy down here praise the lord and i tell you what life is fragile church don't take it for granted it's very fragile amen until you're i'm kind of looking at that point amen you don't realize how fragile it is and it can just be that then it's gone seem to lie amen so we ought to just as brother joe said amen i like what he said i'd rather come here than to go there today praise god i'm glad i got a zeal to go to the house of god amen i got i got a zeal don't want to serve the lord in this hour praise god oh i may not be able to

people that really love the lord and thank god for that church amen that we may be a lighthouse amen a lot of people i was listening to a tape the other night uh singing tape and and and the guy that was kind of narrating they kept talking about the blood the blood the blood the blood and i got to think you know the the church world looks at the blood well you know the blood is what saved me that's right but they don't realize there's an association that goes with that blood but the band said it ain't the chemistry it's the life that was in there and if you can get the life that was in that blood in you it'll cause you to be like what it is praise god amen to god so god bless you we love you all today amen to god praise god oh how wonderful it is to be with the saints of god i've been blessed so much already when brother tony got up and started singing yes we know where we're going right we don't know when we may make it but we know we're going and it won't be long i can assure you that i'm going to try something i'm doing it for his glory i wouldn't do it in any any other way it's a song i've heard a number of times it just just touches my heart but it may not be that well known and so our sister's going to successfully going to try to pick up i don't sing well with music so i don't know what i'm going to do with that if you know it and you want to sing along it's called how deep the father's love for us and it's deeper to this we'll know i don't know if i can even sing i'm gonna try how deep the father's love for us how vast beyond all measure that he should give his only son to make a wretch his treasure his treasure that's what we are how great the pain of searing laws the father turns his face away as wounds which martha chosen one bring many sons to glory behold the man upon the cross my sin upon his shoulder ashamed i hear my mocking voice call out among the scarf it was my sin that held him there until it was a completion his dying breath has brought me life i know that it is finished i will not boast in anything no gifts no par nor wisdom but i will boast in jesus christ his death and resurrect why should i gain from his reward i cannot give an answer but this i know with all my heart his wounds have paid my ransom o glorious god who's made mercy's great knew me before the world began he called me for his purpose plan he lives within my soul today how can a sinner man like me be worthy of my father's love i cannot end this flesh replay except his love shines through me how can a sinner men like me be worthy of my father's love i cannot in this flesh replay except his love shines through me god bless you we anymore we don't have any more pastors do we so we i guess brother homer we're down to you we don't have

amen this afternoon they may not trust that god's been good to you amen and so we're like jay said he's alive amen and not only that he's alive and well right and then by god's grace amen we're still pressing the battle right now amen and uh i thought you know in the last few days you know it seemed like some of us has had a lot of problems amen but we're just a little bit closer home than we were amen and i i just appreciate god and i thank god for he's a keeper amen when you can't keep yourself he keeps you amen because there's a lot of times we would give up amen but you know why we can't because he's greater it's he that's in us and neither said the world and amen and i thank god for that i thank god for truth i thought god what would we do without this truth in this hour which listen

god bless you and all your precious saints to be in fellowship around this unchanging word amen praise the lord well we got uh just a little bit of time so let's go ahead and get started amen praise the lord let's start in jeremiah chapter seven we just love to fellowship around this word praise god how many has been in the message for longer than three weeks amen all right that's good enough for me praise god let's go ahead and get in again jeremiah chapter seven we're going to start reading in verse 1 down to verse 12. praise god good to see dear brother jonathan oglesby he's got a job that requires him to travel sometimes he comes down to mobile and he's always there on a wednesday night he never gets down there on sundays but praise the lord good to be here with brother dear brother and see him once again and see everybody of like precious faith amen praise the lord god bless you all so much gonna share a little thought today real quick try to be as brief as possible on uh shiloh and the seventh seal amen all right jeremiah chapter seven verse one down to twelve and we'll let you be seated says the word that came to jeremiah from the lord saying stand in the gate of the lord's house and proclaim there this word and say hear the word of the lord all ye of judah that enter in at these gates to worship the lord thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel amend your ways and your doings and i will cause you to dwell in this place trust me not in lying words saying the temple of the lord the temple of the lord the temple of the lord are these for if ye thoroughly amend your ways and your doings if you thoroughly execute judgment between a man and his neighbor if you oppress not the stranger the fatherless and the widow and shed not innocent blood in this place neither walk after other gods to your hurt then will i cause you to dwell in this place in the land that i gave to your fathers everybody with it we've been restored back to the land of our apostolic fathers we want to dwell in that land the land that's been restored the faith the apostolic faith that's been restored we want to dwell in and abide in that land and here's the lord warning israel what to do in order to abide and remain in that land whenever god would bring judgment against israel he would take him out of the land of the covenant amen so then will i cause you to dwell in this land verse 7 in the land that i gave to your fathers forever and ever behold you you trust in lying words that cannot profit will you still murder and commit adultery and swerve falsely and burn instance unto baal and walk after other gods whom you know not and come and stand before me in this house which is called by my name and say we are delivered to do all these abominations is this house which is called by my name become a den of robbers in your eyes behold even i have seen it saith the lord and and this is where we want to put emphasis here but go ye now unto my place which was in shiloh where i set my name at the first and see what i did to it for the wickedness of my people israel god bless you can be seated bless the lord god may he add his blessings to the reading of his word amen amen i chose that to start start us off here to just kind of get us a little adjusted to this idea that whenever the children of israel crossed over jordan and they rested the ark they put it in a place a city a town called shiloh and shiloh means a place of rest or tranquility and shiloh was a gathering place of the people of israel they would gather in shiloh i'd like to draw your attention also to genesis chapter 49. genesis chapter 49 jacob's prophesying to his sons and he's on judah and verse 10 he's speaking of judah and he says the scepter shall not depart from judah amen a king of israel will always be from the tribe of judah right most of the time saul was from the tribe of benjamin but you know that was man's choice god chose david david was from the tribe of judah and here's the prophecy right here the scepter shall not depart from judah right and we know jesus is the lion of the tribe of and he is the king amen the king so in verse 10 is a prophecy of him the scepter shall not depart from judah nor a law giver from between his feet until shiloh come right and unto him shall the gathering of the people be amen so we have shiloh spoken of in jeremiah as a physical geographical place but here in genesis 49 shiloh spoken of as a person amen shiloh is the person jesus christ because shiloh means place of rest and we know that jesus christ is a place of god's rest amen so we're just going to try to relate some things to you today about connecting this to the seventh seal the mystery of the seventh seal and so on and so forth and let's start the the uh in john 11 as well john chapter 11 just kind of get this put in here praise god we know that the restoration of the faith was necessary we didn't know until after god sends the prophet everybody thought everything was fine they didn't know they needed restoration a lot of people didn't and praise god now that god has sent a prophet and the seven seals have opened we see how desperately we needed restoration we need to be restored back into the land of the apostolic fathers praise god we need to be restored back to the truth of god's gathering place amen remember these sermons brother branham preached about god's only provided place of worship you know god's provided place and so in these different sermons where brother branham teaches us out of deuteronomy 16 where god told israel you'll not offer your sacrifice in any other gate but the place that i choose to put my name in so brother abraham shows us that god put his name in christ and that's the gathering place amen that's the place of our gathering is in christ we have a very precious gathering here today and it's wonderful amen brother wade got to go to the philippines and gather with saints over there and there's saints in africa gathering every and the saints of god gather together and as the dear brother says is the hour is so late we should be gathering together more as the bible says so much the more as you see the day approaching glory amen shouldn't get cold and or lukewarm and try to and shy away from the gathering of god's people but come together amen and uh those gatherings are important but all that reflects the main gathering and that's the gathering in christ amen seven church ages have come and in every age god sent a messenger to gather his elect into himself amen here we have a prophecy by the high priest ephesus in saint john chapter 11. in verse 47 you know it quite well i'm sure and we're just going to verse uh 50 and 51 it says nor consider that is expedient for us that one man should die for the whole for the people and that the whole nation perished not and this spake he not of himself but being high priest that year he prophesied that jesus should die for that nation and not only for that nation only but that also he should gather together in one the children that are that were scattered abroad amen now i know about you but it rejoices my heart to know assuredly that god almighty is on the job gathering his elected children into that place getting them people ready and prepared amen to go to the marriage supper of the lamb amen gathering them in christ which is the word made manifest for the age that they live in gathering them in that vindicated word gather them into that place amen because jesus christ is the way the truth and the life and without the way there ain't no going without the life there's no living amen without the truth there's no knowing amen he's the way the truth and the life praise god he's perfect everything is that right i don't know about you but there ain't no greater place to gather but in christ and the bible says that for by one spirit we're all baptized into one body there is a gathering place amen praise god there is a questions and answers question that was just wonderful it struck my heart i found it late but it's the first quote i asked the brothers to get up there out of 64 to questions and answers paragraph 190. the question was put to brother branham just like this he says when and where will the people of god gather for the last word right huh how many of you know brother brown had the answer right amen where'd brother brown get his answer from the bible amen he says in christ yep for the last day they'll gather in christ this is fascinating brother sisters because people thought the gathering place was in a church the gathering place was in her the church but it's not the gathering place is in him the word is that right that's the gathering place so praise god for that revelation right there's a difference between just attending church anybody can walk through the door of a church but it's the holy ghost that places them in this place in christ amen amen the gathering is of the lord right there's a gathering of man but there's a gathering of the lord right amen we want to be of the gathering that's of the lord called sanctified filled and placed positionally in that place amen uh let's have that scripture in ephesians 4 30. sorry i jumped ahead to the quotes there brothers here's one ephesians chapter 4 verse 13. talking about the fivefold ministry there for the perfecting of the saints right and then verse 13 till we all come in the unity of the faith how many faiths are there just one faith amen there's one body right so there's only one gathering place is that right that's right amen till we all come in the unity of the faith right and of the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man uh to the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ amen being in that gathering place been in that place amen so you know what jesus said in matthew 24 28 i believe it was where the carcasses there will the eagles be gathered together and that carcass is the fresh kill of the word amen and we also realize if we just take a minute here and met and and consider the things brother brandon brought to us in those various sermons of uh god's provided place of worship and sermons like that where he shows us that jesus christ is the word made manifest in the flesh and that is the place god put his name brother branham teaches us that in every age when the word is manifested in that age that's jesus christ so whatever age you're living in the word that was written for that age the spirit of god quickens that word makes that word live for that hour that's jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever and that's where god put his name god puts his name in the manifestation of the word is that right well the revelation is that's the only place god accepts worship that's the only place you can worship amen i know it's a hard pill to swallow but anybody that tries to worship god outside of that place is not being received the worship's not being accepted right because god only accepts worship in the place that he put his name and the only place he put his name is where the words manifested is that right that's right so it's awfully important to know what word is being manifested for the hour that you live in amen amen even in the message realm the thing is advanced in the last 50 years the revelation of the word the understanding of the message the putting together of the word amen people still walking around with puzzle pieces missing yeah right this dear lady loved her husband so much and her husband liked to put puzzles together and she brought him a puzzle home and she was pulling it out of the car and dropped the box on the driveway and spilled the puzzle pieces all over the driveway and she gathered them all up best she could and took it in the house gave it to the husband and she and he was like oh thank you so much dear i just sit here this afternoon and put my puzzle together and he put his puzzle together and there's seven pieces missing he said dear i don't have all the pieces oh my goodness i thought i picked them all up i must have lost them somewhere and some dear neighbor of theirs came over and her eyesight wasn't too good so she had to have a little bit of help amen god sent him a prophet amen god sent him somebody that could see real good amen and that person was able to see and scope out them seven pieces lost in the driveway brought him up to the door knocked on the door and said here you go neighbor here's the seven pieces you've been missing and he was able to bring them seven pieces in there and put them right in their place and the picture was perfect amen what we need today is an understanding that the picture is perfect it's been put together amen god sent us a seer in these last days we don't have no missing puzzle pieces right a lot of people like to think we are they like to preach we do but we don't it's perfect just got to have anointed eyes to see a perfect message amen is that right yes sir so without the picture being perfect and this is what i share with you today and don't take my word for it just keep studying but without the picture being put together perfect you can't have rapturing faith rapturing faith depends upon having the full word restored in these last days let's start in our first in the quote of first seal paragraph 75 brother brahm says and then there's coming forth seven mysterious thunders that's not even written at all and we know he recorrected that later on and said it's not something not written in the word something that's been hid in the word that's right and i believe that through those seven thunders will be revealed in the last days in order to get the bride together for rapturing faith to get the bride together amen amen now let's just use some plain language here and get it out of our heads that we got to get together physically or geographically in a natural place right because jesus said that the rapture would be universal there'll be two in the bed and it's at night time over here but there'll be two in the field working as daytime over there so when the translation happens it happens worldwide but there is a gathering place and your brothers and sisters overseas are gathered in the same place you're gathered in hearing the same voice you're hearing coming into the same faith the same revelation that you're coming into having the same faith perfected in your heart is being perfected in their heart because we're all receiving the same revelation through the same voice of the archangel amen so these seven mysteries are revealed in last days in order to get the bride together to get the bride together with who to get the bride together where our lord jesus christ amen invisible union paragraph 199. praise god don't you know when you get invited to speak somewhere you get everything thrown at you but the kitchen sink been struggling but i'm trying to throw it back praise god our gathering place is in christ amen now paul wrote the new testament that's right he wrote romans and romans and all the rest of it there hebrews and timothy and so forth and to do that he had to separate from himself and go down in arabia into a desert for three years get the revelation of god oh you say how about matthew mark luke and john they were scribes that just wrote what jesus did paul separated put the word together amen that messenger did for them people what our messenger did for us put the word together he said we get many sermons and tapes so you can dovetail all scripture right paul separated put the word together that's right well then look if it taken that and had to go to a desert away from their loved ones remember what time is it sir mr brother brown i'm talking about how to go out west how many ever heard it say amen congregation says amen what is exactly what's exactly right amen then we've got the revelation in these last days for the message of the lord god to gather his bride together right amen there's something about that voice ain't there right that voice is what god uses to gather that bride together no other age has it been promised it's promised in this age malachi 4 luke 17 30. amen saint john 14 12 2 38 those promises is just exactly like john the baptist identified himself in the scripture amen so just going to try to set you up a little bit for tomorrow because we're going to just kind of close here pretty quick but we're just going to try to build into something and snowball right now jesus identified himself is that right right jesus identified himself in the scripture is that right remember when brother branham was in memphis tennessee and god grounded that plane and god sent his prophet down in that neighborhood right and seeing that dear lady sitting at the gate and she said parson you ever read that story in the bible about the shunammite woman and robert said yes and she said well parson as that kind of woman she identified herself in the scripture and she was in prayer to the lord said here's the son you gave me like that shenanimite woman but where's your elijah that's faith putting herself right in that word is that right and god come right down to that channel and moved on his prophet and brought the elijah right to that shunammite woman amen praise the lord that's a good example to follow that's why you want to take the message back to the scripture amen jesus identified himself what'd they say away was such a person john is a wow man the church wasn't able to receive it that's the pattern neither will the church receive it today though it be scripturally vindicated up one side down the other vindicated think we're crazy they think the joke's on us but we're following vindication the joke's not on us a joke's on them we're following something that's vindicated proven amen but the gathering of the people there is a gathering of the people amen now the rapture message praise god the third thing is a trumpet which always at the feast of trumpets is calling the people to a feast and that'll be the bright supper the lamb's supper with the bride right in the sky see the first thing comes forth is his message which is the shout out thessalonians 4 16 amen the shout the voice and the trump but the first thing is that shout and he says the first thing comes forth is his message calling his bride together calling his bride together the next thing is the resurrection how many believes we're real close to that right now i believe with all my heart god help us to live so separated from the things of the world and live right up into this word here amen we can change into atoms when that hour comes amen praise god we want to be looking for our lord jesus christ now end time evangelism this quote always gets me right here you look around what goes on in churches what goes on in people's lives and you realize this right here in end time evangelism paragraph 222 this is pretty plain now we're going to end right here by saying this the end time message is to get the bride ready and prepared for the rapture exactly right what else is there to do huh going to church is important but that's just part of it your church going to church is supposed to get you to serve to get you ready and prepared for the rapture that's the way you should look at it amen because you're coming to church to feed on the message is that right and what'd that song say about a body change today keep feasting on the word amen strength comes by the word of god the revelation of the word amen let's look at uh escape hither come quickly in 1958 on paragraph e 44 escape hither come quickly down at the end do we have that highlighted we're going to have to read the whole thing right there brother brown makes this statement and the worldwide vision is to make more money huh the worldwide vision is to buy new clothes the worldwide vision is for the body of the lord jesus christ to get ready for the rapture that man caught brother branham around the church after that meeting one day and said brother branham you scare the people he says what do you mean scare the people talk about the coming of the lord and brother branson said what people not god's people huh not god's people that's the greatest thing he can think of was the coming of the lord you preach that sometimes you can see the look in people's faces they're not ready they would rather push off the coming of the lord another 10 years huh i had somebody actually tell me and i'm sorry i'm going to close here in a minute they said brother matthew i want to see my children grow up i said well i want to see my children grow up too but i want to see jesus more right and that's the way it is the lord jesus christ should mean more to you than anything he's perfect everything amen all in all forever jesus will i sing everything in jesus and jesus everything amen that's right the coming of the lord jesus praise god now that gathering place in shiloh was very important the ark of the covenant stayed there for years and years and years stayed there through the whole time of the judges if you remember hannah she was the second wife and the first wife of that gentleman's name i can't recall his name right now but she was bearing him children and hannah couldn't bear children so hannah goes to the tabernacle in shiloh and cries out before the lord and eli thought she was drunk and she was crying to the lord so she can bear a child and god gave her samuel and samuel was raised in shiloh amen that's right and whenever that tabernacle as we read in jeremiah the lord was telling them go look at what happened to shiloh where my name was at the first god put his name there and uh whenever in joshua chapter 18 there were seven remaining tribes left to be placed and joshua told him why stan ye lack concerning the promise of god go up and take the land and he told them to go up and down the land describe the land in a book and there were seven tribes so there's seven parts in a book that they described so they brought a seven part book to joshua and the bible says that joshua stood in the door of the tabernacle in shiloh amen and i believe with all my heart brother branham was in shiloh spiritually speaking because shiloh is christ amen and just as joshua divided a seven part book for the seven remaining tribes to enter into their inheritance amen god's prophet stood in shadow in the shiloh in these last days and revealed the seven part book so we can enter into our part amen it's by the opening of the word you recognize your place and your position in this day and in this hour and it's that truth that's connected to rapturing faith amen so so god bless you today my brothers and sisters i just wanted to kind of get the thoughts started right there amen so god bless you i appreciate being with you appreciate meeting these dear ministers for the first time and i'm so glad to be gathered with you but i'm much gladder to be gathered in christ amen god bless you all so much appreciate you and thank god for that gathering place amen god bless you amen god bless you brother amen and christ said what he's the word right that was brother moak's favorite saiyan he's saying christ is the word see that's what it means right let's stand together sing and just come on musicians and we'll sing a little bit and let the sisters get everything ready downstairs and get ready to where we can fellowship together and eat together and have a good time in that tell our brother how much you appreciate the message because i believe it i believe i want to stay in shiloh don't you i want to be where the word's at all right and and that way then you don't have to worry about the rest of it it'll take care of itself all the other things that we always you know concerned about who's going to be president like i told you one time years ago you know when we were talking about it i said you want me to tell you who's going to be president everybody's thinking boy i had some kind of a vision or had something like that i said the bible says i put in kings and take out kings so that's who's going to be there who god wants to be the next president whether it be hillary or her husband again you said he can't do that well they can do a lot of things if they want to ain't nothing we can do about it let's just sing and worship a little bit until they get ready to 604 in the spiral book until they get ready to get to supper and everything fixed for us and you know you have been through anybody have a need because we believe praying for the oh i'll see i'll see you at that meeting why would we be concerned about anything else other than the message they're gonna put us in the rapture to know who's gonna be president that won't work but to know the message of the hour we may not have been there to see it some of now we can see the real true meaning the rapture you know i told the church one day like this when did the rapture start i believe it started on the day of pentecost because that's when the holy ghost came to put somebody in the heavenly places in christ jesus so it began back there we're in the manifestation of the finishing up we're in the part where it's going to be made manifest and change his body it started back there but if you don't have that baptism of the holy ghost that new birth to start with reading the other day where the probably said you can't know that god is god without having the new birth how can you oh you got to have something on the inside to explain it to you now what's on the outside that's wonderful like i've always said and i believe it and the prophet of god cannot even give you a revelation even brother rather said jesus couldn't give you a revelation come on do you believe that he said the holy ghost is the only repealer of the world thank god for the ones who brings it to us but that inside man is not there that new birth no wonder the prophet would say one day he said the baptism of the holy ghost is the most important thing in your life but only by that can you come to a point only by that when we come to a change to a manifestation of christ wonderful isn't it think of the word that we have heard when we used to question about these things that was in the bible and written out we wondered what they were and we had opinions and ideas you know that what was it clarence larkin it was him that said the white horse rider was the antichrist that was before brother branham ever come along but he wasn't a prophet he just made a good guess or a good thought because he couldn't put it in the bible because he was sitting on the horse right he was sitting on the horse the prophet was talking about he was in the church the prophet was talking about but then when the prophet came said he just put it all right in order and you could see it what a wonderful day what a wonderful time what a wonderful hour that you and i live in go ahead we're waiting on this word from downstairs a little more today and you have to love his word you know if you love him you gotta love me that's why god is so good all things are passed away i've been born again more than all right let's let them play one now all right clap with it i love good music believe god loves good music we are the fathers we are one him amen hope you enjoyed the service today but our brother how much appreciated fellowshipping together having a good time in the lord now we come down to the place place that we can go sit down and eat together so we got the word everything's ready so let's ask the blessing go downstairs now remember company goes first but don't you stumble around and don't you goof off and don't stand and eat in the line you get on through cause i'm gonna be the last one and i'm hungry all right so we appreciate you coming hope you enjoy everything and remember brother tom will i be having the next service no all right father we thank you for this day in your love and your understanding thank you for your grace and guidance unto us thank you for our brother that brought the word unto us and we believe it we believe lord that we're now resting and shallow we're in the place that we need to be and peace can be upon our hearts we ask you now to just
