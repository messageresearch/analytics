TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] heavenly [Music] he totally appreciate him don't we to see everybody in the house of the Lord we got a notice that a brother most of us some of you knowing brother Max world is from Jamaica he was in brother Brady's church there in Jamaica pastoring with him and him preaching brother and he passed away last at a stroke last week and he died Knoll I had a stroke last year remember that we pray for it but he passed away last week so remember the Maxwell family there in Jamaica Lord knows of the oranges pray that the Lord would be with the family and everything he meant all right good to be in the house of Lord we're ready to hear the word so let's just sing that our brother comes to speak the word unto us man open the eyes of my heart Lord open the eyes of mine is that your desire I want to see all funny eyes of my heart [Music] Oh [Music] Oh ah [Music] hey man you want to see him tonight was turning our scriptures to Luke chapter 10 verse 18 and then we'll read in Genesis chapter 2 verses 18 to 25 let's just go to the Lord in prayer or Jesus we're just so grateful to be able to come into your presence tonight or Jesus is so grateful for your presence here and I pray God that you'll just open your word to us Lord and help something some of us to glean something out of what's dead tonight or guarded it might be a benefit or and I believe that I'm speaking to your bride tonight Lord and I pray that you'll help me to treat it right or Jesus to say something to be edifying that I'll get myself out of the way Lord Jesus that you can speak in it or digital just seal my lips to say anything in my own opinion or my own ideas or anything that my own thinking Lord Jesus because I know that my own opinions are all my ideas are not edifying or not what won't produce what's right or Jesus granted I pray Lord that you'll just be with us tonight we welcome you Lord God to come and quicken this word to us Lord Jesus come to come and be welcome in our midst Lord Jesus we pray we ask these things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen Luke chapter 10 verse 18 as you might recognize this from Sunday school I'm going to kind of recap a little bit of what was said then and with a little bit of help from this other scripture I read and you ever notice how brother Branham said when he was when he would preach he said he went and when he started out in his ministry he'd he'd list some scriptures down and because everything has to come out of the water he was preaching from what was written he was preaching he just wrote scriptures down to each scripture or just he the Spirit would inspire it and just pull it right off the page if the believer in reality when the scripture says and he said unto them I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven behold I give you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall be shall by any means hurt you that's a fantastic front was Emory notwithstanding in this or Joyce not that the spirits are subject unto you but rather rejoice because your names are written in heaven because we know that included Judas and and that's kind of a complicated topic about all the different sections and everything where everybody's written but really the main topic tonight I'm going to be talking about the ones that are written in the Lamb's Book of Life they cannot be renewed that you're in God's mind and and and are gonna stay there just from the beginning to the end so let's go to Juice's chapter two verse eighteen to twenty five and this is and the Lord God said it just may be for a topic I'm going to take the topic that you got sunday-school message I took for a topic written in him but tonight I want to just take a little a little fall a one-man message and the Lord God said it is not good that the man should be alone I will make him an help meet for him and out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field and every fowl of the air and brought them under Adam to see what he would call it and whatsoever Adam called every living creature that was the name thereof and Adam gave names to all cattle into the fowl of the air into every beast of the field but for Adam there was not found and help meet for him and the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slipped and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof and the rib which the Lord God had taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man and Adam said this is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of me therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother excuse me and it shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be how many one flesh and they were both naked the man and his wife and we're not ashamed you may be seated the Lord is blessing to the reading of the and we know we know brother branham talk about how that uh he kind of went through all the parables in the Old Testament and and coming up through the new about how God chooses one man to bring the message he deals with one man at a time one man to deliver the message and then one man to to receive the message that's you that's you individually because it's an individual basis if you the delivery is an individual the receiving is an individual the person delivering and the person delivering it is a conduit from that one man back there in Genesis 1:26 27 which which is where you were written so I just want to kind of start off with some of these quotes that that brother Branham talked about upon one man message I think you know in this day and time that that phrase a one man message is kind of it can get you if you if you don't approach it from the right from the right angle because you say well this was a one man message and therefore if so as some say well then the bride has no way know that the people have no opportunity to speak you can't have your own revelation because this one man is the only one that can speak now I want to get it something else too because you know here you look at it at Adam and Eve that that they were they were united that was perfect one that's there in the Garden of God coming down and fellowshipping with them in the Garden of Eden and brother and so they could fit a fellowship anytime they anytime they wanted they were in oneness where Adam and Eve and God were all in sync all in harmony there wasn't like any kind of own ideas and things going on until the the story of Satan you know serpent the serpent coming in and doing his thing but everything was just in one sink and Adam and Eve were even called by the same name if you kind of think about that imagine how that might still look if if God was calling Adam Adam come over here I want to talk to you and they both turned it wasn't like one would go and Adam and Eve were always together I believe that you know there's not like a quote I can pull so maybe that might be an argument you say but I believe that the Adam and Eve were always together always they they responded to the same name because they were called by the same name you didn't have a separate name until until they got disharmony came into into being they were called by the same thing because they were and they were in fellowship with that one man that one man of justice 126 27 the first ladies didn't bring out now look just kind of run through this Genesis chapter 2 I told you I was gonna read some quotes but I changed my mind let me just keep forcing ahead the Bible says that out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field and every fowl of the air and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them and he began to give them names and I believe that you know a name means something that means like the essence if God puts his name on you if he puts it in your forehead that means so that it means ownership it means it has it means that the nature of that person is applied to you because the name is what that thing is and so when Adam began to name these things he wasn't just conjuring up what just some some kind of opinion or something but just just to kind of illustrate it may be that the Dove would come before him and he said that I see that this this thing doesn't have a God it can't eat just whatever he's got to eat only this particular particular grain and so I'm going to call this a dove because that's what it is that's the essence of what this thing is and maybe the lamb would come come walking before and we need to say I can see that this thing produces wool they don't even have to think about it and it's got this real neat nature it's got to be led and all these things and he said I see what this is and so I'm going to call it lamb because he h éeer of the father was speaking through him and he knew what to apply was what to call that thing and maybe the the ox would come before him and he put that name on that because of the beasts of burden and it could carry in and keep you know plowing along or or whatever you know he knew what that thing was and so he applied a name to it and that's something I'm gonna get you a little bit later when I get into talking about how God puts he writes his name on you he writes that and that's applying what he knew about you from the before the foundation of the world because you you were written into him your names are in that description we were at earlier Luke 10:18 Luke 20 that you rejoice because your names are written in heaven and where your name's written your names are written into him again again you know you even go back to the Justice 128 126 127 but if you keep going on to the next verse just as 128 it says that God bless them maybe that's kind of a little scripture that oftentimes we just kind of skip all over get right into the multiplying and repletion earth but it says he blessed them and I believe that that blessing is the same thing that Paul was talking about in Ephesians 1:3 1:3 where he said blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ so where do you get your blessings he blessed that spirit man that one man and that's what I'm talking about tonight a one man message and he met bless that one man and if you're part of that one man if you were written in that man tonight then you can have access to all of those blessings that's the only way that you can have access to those blessings is to be part of that man if you're not part of that man and everything that's not part of that everything that's not eternal will cut eventually come to an end but that man never had a beginning never had no father no mother never had a beginning or any kind of lineage it was always existed and his nature is always the same his nature back then is going to be the same nature it is today when he was when he was expressed back then in Genesis 1:26 27 and then expressed later on as Genesis 2:7 that nature was exactly the same when he came down in flesh God can look down at him and see that man Jack's look just like I do that man maybe walks and dogs and does the same things that I do that's what God is molding us into into his image so that we react we put aside our selves we lay outside our own this flash and we begin to look and mold ourselves more into the image of the Father you know you know Paul if you read the New Testament you see that Christians are really in stages there's there's the newborn babies that are designed it's the silver for the other word and then there's the children that are talked about by everyone a doctrine but we're all growing up it tore the head which is Christ growing up to be adults and you know to take a body change you got to be an adult you got to know where you can't be tossed around wondering whether in a fog wondering which way to go which way to turn and everything but you got to know you got to have a revelation of where you came from or where you're going and what's happening right now and that's the simplicity of the gospel sometimes we think that simplicity mean is the same thing as a shower simplicity does not mean shower simplicity can be deep in fact you know you got in the ocean the deeper you go this little system the more simple against its simplicity that when you begin to go deep into God's Word and everything begins to tie together you say oh well that's talking about that and that's talking about that and it's simple because the deeper you go the simpler gifts simple is you can go out and look at the simplicity of the of the ocean evaporating and God moving everything up from the ocean into the into the clouds so it will rain and it's very simple and God's Word is simple deep doesn't mean hard deep can be simple I just so we talked about written in him so let me jump down to this just a next chapter in Luke chapter 10 verse 18 where it says he said unto them I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven Satan's fallen from heaven because because when these people began to get a grasp of what was happening and there things were written in heaven in the book of life then Satan what Satan became powerless and Satan is powerless when a real Christian gets ahold of who they are when a Christian begins to realize who they are and their place in their authority you know brother Branham said even that somebody that gets a hold of the word a minister standing behind the pulpit for example has more authority than an angel in heaven and he course you know the scripture that used for that is Paul said if an angel from heaven comes it preaches any other gospel than what I've already preached because he had authority was standing on the Word of God he knew where he stood because he knew what was written in heaven and when you when you know what's written in heaven and that what is written in heaven is now being manifested in earth then that makes Satan powerless that it says behold I give unto you power to dreidels tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you not withstanding and this rejoice not that the spirits are subject unto you but rather rejoice because your names are written in heaven you know they're kind of that prefigure of a sanctifying condition where they they hadn't even come to to the new birth experience yet God had not coming and dwelt himself and the power of making them sons of God images to him but yet even in that sanctified condition they were able to cast out Devils and have authority over the devil because they were getting an idea they were getting a revelation they were operating in the authority under what was written in God's Word see that's how much power the writ of Revelation is even without the new birth they had authority over the Devils to cast them out to preach the gospel what they understood at that time in Jesus name but yet Jesus said uh don't don't get you know too excited over that what you should really be excited over is that your names are written in heaven where were they written in where were they written that there's only one book that I know of and that's the book of Christ that the God this book here is God and let her form that came down that God got wrote on the page and he wrote on the page by the experiences of people that we're living out their lives that God was writing out their story according to what he knew that they would do from the from the foundation of the world and he's writing out your story too he's writing out your story the same way that he wrote out that Daniels story of the down in the lion's den and the three Hebrew children and they were delivered from the fire because he delivered you from the fire of sin and affliction he delivered you from the mouth of the line because it says that the Bible says that Satan is a roaring lion and he's delivered you from those things and as he does it he's writing out your story so that you can look back and you can see that these things that these people lived in the Bible now I'm tired of that I can identify with that I could see my own life being made manifest and fulfilling what was written in God's Word back there but there's a difference between the power that there's a deeper God God's unfolding himself there's a difference between that power just to cast out Devils and things and the deeper power that they got on the day of Pentecost which was power to the sons of God power to make manifest that to make manifest that man that one man message that was back there before the foundation of the world to reveal that in flesh so that it could be tangible so that they could have fellowship with God so that they could have fellowship with those other attributes that we're back there have fellowship with one another and go to church and worship and rejoice and the power to be sons of God is what I'm talking about where you could be molded in His image and made it like this sorry for you and let's look at that number six quote brother on sending God's power to transform he said it's an old familiar text that many of your pastor says use down for your time that's been used since it was written but yet one thing about the Word of God it never grows old because is God it never grows old through every generation now for pretty near about twenty eight hundred years or better this word of God has been read by man priest and so forth and never does it grow old I've been reading it myself for some 35 years and each time I read it I find something new that I looked over the first time because here's what I'm getting to because it is inspired it is God in letter form see it's the attributes of God speaking forth and his placed on paper the attributes of God the genes of God the things that were written in God that all that make up who God is that was part of him before the foundation of the world he says the attributes of God is placed on paper and it's speaking forth the attributes of God speaking forth and you know think about that scripture back in Joe where it says where were you and the sons of God shouted for joy where were you and those attributes were praising God because they saw they looked that not not people or anything like that but God the attributes of God were able to he could see the book of redemption being revealed he can see himself being unfolded in a three-fold mystery that first God would come to come God will make himself manifest in the flesh of Jesus Christ and then just like Adam and either the garland out of his side would come the bride and then they would walk together and they eaten and everything would be in perfect oneness God making himself in a perfect unity of faith in harmony with God and his attributes dwelling together it is written see the first part of that the first part of that threefold mystery is that God comes and makes himself manifest in Jesus Christ so when Jesus Christ came on the earth and was born of that incubator Marian and and Joseph was kind of you know he wasn't born of Mary and Joseph he was born from above and and and and he he began to grow up and began to mature and his you know his brain began to develop and his his flesh it the outside began to grow up he began to you know kind of come to a more realization of what was happening and things of course as he as he matured and as she grew he was able to identify what was taking place in his life with what was in the scripture what was already written about him we know there's hundreds and hundreds of scriptures that David and Isaiah and all the prophets talked about how he would come in to be born how he would his life would be and and he could look back and say you know as he stood there in the synagogue when when finally he was able to come to that place he said look it's written I this day the scripture is fulfilled and not just that moment but the whole the whole story of his life how the way the manner that he will be born to the place that he would be born in Bethlehem to the tribe that he would come out of and at his time in Egypt and how he would be preceded by a messenger and the way that he was speaking parables and how he would be betrayed and the potter's field and how that he would be crucified with criminals and hated without a cause and not a bone will be broken and that he would resurrect from the dead and was ascending to heaven and and and you know brother I've talked about that was God's masterpiece how he looked there and he saw now this person right here is in exactly the way I want it this is in the image of the father because that was the father and that's another thing I want to bring out is that when you think about the father and the Son and Holy Ghost and all those things back there that happened it but I'm talking about that lowlife went out and then from there that Genesis 1:26 man went out you you almost run in a danger of getting in your head that these are different people but it's not different people there's only one person there's only one for to Jesus Christ and that's why I title it's the one a one man message because it's not different if it was different people then they'd be all fighting with each other or having different discussions having different ways of thinking thinking about it that's why brother Brennan said it God only deals with one person at a time he only dealt with Moses at a time he dealt with John when he was delivering his message he dealt with brother Brandon when he was delivering the message because you you got to get in sync you get God just gets one man in sync with that one man and he in heaven and and download that message to that one man and then he can distribute it to all the other people they can pick it up I forget where I am so that man that was written where you were written in heaven before the foundation of the world that that writing you know it we we know this is God God and letter form but for this to really be any good it's got to be put something inside of something there's got to be tabernacle inside of you it had to be Tabernacle inside of Jesus Christ and it could be tabernacle inside of you that Genesis 1:26 man could it had to be Tabernacle to the side of that 2:7 man and that be put in somebody so they can walk around that's how that's what the gospel is the gospel is the letter on the page put it into the inside of a person in the power and the demonstration of the spirit so they can demonstrate that power the sons of God and show that God is able to deliver that God is able to say that he's able to take somebody from sin and the heartache and bring them into the devvra lasting joy and all the things that the gospel speaker speaker because the gospel is not just learning it's not just education it's not just that you know there's even a quote in tandem and a sermon influenced that I was REME work you know we say worry you can you can put the word together almost it looks like from just education from just being educated a good educated message person I'll say it like that when you said in good Church long enough that you can be like maybe Adam one of those birds came before him and he saw a parrot and he said I know that I'm call you parrot because you just repeat after somebody else that's the kind of Christian some people are all they do is repeat after other people but God didn't call us to be parents he calls us to know who we are by revelation that the Word of God would comes alive in us and we know who it is and who is speaking of because what the objective we're getting at is that when you know when the bribe begins to realize who she is and what she's there for then then the devil will be powerless right that's what we're talking about in Luke chapter 10 in Genesis chapter 2 - all these things so the word the word that that man that Justice 1:26 for seven man that man back there that is Christ that man is a person that man is a person that you can fellowship with that man is you know we think about what what is the word what does the word mean to you the word is just education the word is just knowledge but the word is an actual person that you can commune with and that person is somebody that could come down on the scene and when that person comes down on that see on the scene and you'll know when they have arrived you oh you won't be wondering if they when you get the baptism of the new birth experience in your life and that person steps inside of your heart you'll know when they've arrived when you're maybe I had a good experience recently where I was down in that prayer line in Louisiana when you that man comes up on the platform and stands there where a lot of ministers are praying you'll know when that person arrives you'll know when that person arrives in the only way that you can get that person into your soul not just anointing on your spirit but into your soul is by the Word of God that's why the Word of God is so important the written word that was written down in heaven now become manifest in a on the paper that you can read and then the only way that you could that person can come and step inside of you is for you to read this word or hear it and believe it that it's delivered to you by the fivefold ministry that the preaching of the word appreciate the preaching of the gospel and you catch it and say I believe that and hang on to it until they become like that parable of the play of the soul and forth planted planted and the only way you can see what's planted only like you you can be sure as to what it what its manifesting you say well how do I knew I got the new birth check check the manifestation with what's written in God's Word it's a comparison with what God got what God's Word said it is then you can be sure that that you could be confident that's how you have confident and God's Word because you can you compare it back with God's Word that Paul said was a mirror you can look into God's Word and mirror it against your life and see where that compares or not but you know there's there's really you know brother Graham talked about the evidence of the new birth but but my conviction is there's really two evidences and those two evidences are faith and works if you have a revelation on the inside it's going to produce works on the outside if you say if you have head knowledge it's going to just produce nothing but if you have a real revelation it's going to produce a life that compares with God's life so that's what he's coming back to get when God comes back at to rapture his bride and you know let's not get technical now he's coming now he's coming is in progress the wrestlers in progress but when when we go to meet him in the air he's coming back to look not just for somebody with head knowledge not for somebody with just a lot of nerd learning but he's coming back to look for that matching piece somebody who he knows really knows not just because somebody told him but they know and it matches together because their life they manifesting on the outside they have power in their life and their in their in their private times and things when when things go wrong and somebody needs prayer and somebody needs deliverance you can lay hands on one another and the power of God flows from one to the other and and God is making manifest himself and his people in that little group of people that is haunting down the house it's getting down to it to where you know like God like God said will I find faith when I return the Word of God is a person the person of Jesus Christ coming and welling inside of you so he went when Jesus came and dwell on the earth he could look back and have confidence and who he was by looking at the written word and comparing that with who is with with his life and in just the same way that you can have confidence in who you are by comparing it with the word you know all the things that brother branded Jesus went through kind of kind of parallels the the way that a Christians life works - he went through all the little kind of milestones of a Christian he was born by the word and it really the only different to get technical there's more differences than just this but there are the major differences that he was an angel the angel Gabriel came to Marian and spoke to her that you're going to have a child and then the difference between that and the way you were born is that you heard from an earthly angel you know these days everybody saying well I don't need to hear from an earthly angel I don't need to hear the gospel the gospel can't be preached from an earth Brian earthly angels because there's only a one man message but but you're not going to you got to hear it from another angel how can you go into the foreign lands where they can't even understand English and there's got to be somebody to take it to them and you know you sit in churches so long and you've got the fees for promised I was reading a quote or brother branham was talking about he said people are rising up businessmen are rising up to say that the ephesians 4:11 promise has failed i want to ask you that question tonight as that failed for you yes without without that visions for in romans 10 and i how could you I can even hear the gospel what I preach I can you call on the Lord how can you I would you to know which way to turn without a preacher but you know there was what's kind of got people's minds all boggled up is that there are true and there are false there's a true new birth and there's a false there's a counterfeit and there's a genuine and there's a counterfeit birth and there's a genuine birth and bren-bren said their way that you know what the real thing is you can you can look at the counterfeit if you've got like a fake dollar bill then that prove that somewhere out there there's got to be a real and the same thing about the the gospel if there's somebody's faking the gospel they're just calling for money and everything there's got to be a real genuine out there that somebody's not interested in popularity or money or women and all those all those things that ministers fall through there's got to be a genuine minister there's got to be a genuine new birth because it's being faked that there's a new birth day that's real and true that whether person of Jesus Christ himself comes the steps on you and testifies to what's really in God's Word so you're born by the word in the same way that Jesus was born by the word although he he was the fullness and you're you're part of the ocean you have access to part of that attribute but there's no different there's no difference it's not a different person if you have access to part of that's not a different person the same person of Jesus Christ your dwelling and you and measure the number was dwelling in to him and fullness it's one person that's the revelation of the God here there's not three different people there's just one person and down there at the River Jordan when they're known in chemo only him kind of typing your birth he said he told John we got to fulfill all righteousness we got to fulfill everything that's right you know that was even the reason why David was selected to be king over the books of Isis talks about him because his desire will see to see all the Word of God fulfilled and then he after after he the anointing fell on him at the River Jordan and he went into the wilderness for forty days and forty nine days to be tempted and he combatted the devil just the same way that you come back the devil and your daily walk by speaking the word by the word there's no other way to fight the devil than by the word you can fight him with your own ideas and try to have a little mind battles with him but you lose that battle every time when you take God at His Word and challenge and take the take take that to the devil that will defeat the devil because when you know that's the scripture we read earlier when you know your position in Christ that gives you authority because the whole Word of God is backing you up like like if I'm if I'm standing up here preaching my own ideas and everything then I have no back up but if I'm preaching whatever what comes out of the pages of this Bible then I got all heaven backing me up but who can challenge somebody that's got all ahead I'm backing them up and then the Bible talks about Hebrews 5:8 that he learned obedience to the word and he grew in grace Luke 2:40 and then he was accepted on Mouse Transfiguration and the Bible talks about all the all these other stories of things that happen to different people in the Bible but if you want to see if you want to have confidence in who you are you've got to see who you are in him because he is the focus of the whole thing it's one a one man message it's not a one man message with a lot of hangers off or anything but it's a one man message where within him or many members a mini membered body back there in Genesis 1:26 27 is being fulfilled now in flesh in full manifestation where you can look at each other because it's Psalm 139 verses 15 and 16 that says my substance was not hid from me when I was made a secret and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth that I did see my substance yet being unperfect and in thy book all my members were written which in continuance were fashioned when as yet there was none of them think about that that God knew back there before the foundation of the world who would love him and it was not and who would who would do this who would struggle to become a Christian and who who were just you know some people brother I'm talked about some people could just reach out and grab it by faith and they just hate just it looks like things just come naturally this is a great faith just reach out and grab it but others it seems like they struggle a bit more but God knew all those things there's nothing new to God there's no new thought and he knew the end from the beginning and he knew what your situation would be tonight and he knows what the remedy is and if you know that he knows and know that he's concerned then you be convinced and concerned right back convinced a concern that what's written in him is true and what's written what's written into God's Word is rekt and that he's going to lead and guide you to all truth and all righteousness because he's showing you what was written he's showing you when when he gives you the newark new birth he's beginning to show you what was written what was written was this threefold mystery of the unveiling that you're part of him and and he's part of you or you're part of him and and like the description John says uh-oh and that day you shall know that I'm and my father and you and me and I and you and although it's all one just like Adam and he walking in the garden oneness and unity with God in perfect harmony no difference everything was in sync because John says in chapter 14 23 26 jesus answered and said unto him if a man love me he will keep my words what words is he keeping the words that were written in him before the foundation of the world and my father will love him and we will come unto Him see when you get the new birth it's not just the Holy Ghost coming into you as though as the third person or something like that but other Father Son and Holy Ghost are all coming and live inside of you because it's one person and make our abode with him he that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings sayings those things are the things that were written and if you have the teacher inside of you the one to fulfill what was written in heaven that he's going to begin to teach you the scripture and the word which he hear is not mine but the father's which sent me these things have I spoken unto you being yet present with you but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost who your father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you and that's the same thing that happened in John chapter 12 it talks about how that when they when Jesus rode into Jerusalem on the donkey and then they began to realize they begin to remember that these things were written of him because they remembered all the things that had they had heard about and and read in the scripture and they remembered they they recognized what they saw that's the story of a believer you go along you know I remember when we first kind of be impersonal here but when we first started coming to church here it was kind of like it I didn't know what was going on but well your long and long you begin to remember you forget things begin to come together just like they did they maybe they didn't understand what was taking place what was happening but things begin to come together until finally it comes together into the full picture that brother banner talked about and we're not looking at a picture of a club of cow in a field with a sky and everything that was an illustration but what we're looking at is the picture of the fullness of Christ the picture of the stature of a perfect man and that man is Christ that was that this bringing himself down from an eternal state and eternal position a heavenly position into into an earthly to be manifest in your flesh I'm spraying everywhere I'm sorry like Galatians 3:16 says now to Abraham and his seed where the promises made he say it's not into seeds as of many but as of one and to thy seed which is Christ and that's that that's where you were written that's what I'm talking about that one man that one seed and the seed is something that can be reproduced that's the only way that you can reproduce something is to have a sea that is fertilized in dermot eyes they can reproduce and Galatians 3:29 says and if he be Christ's then are ye Abraham's seed if you be Christ's if you were part of him if you were written in him then are you Abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise so how do you see yourself in hell you look in the pages of God's Word and see the things that were spoken of the promises come leap off and see your life is able to is manifestly what was written your life is manifesting justification all the scriptures that talked about that you've been through that experience like Abraham's journey you live through all those things that you've you've experienced that you've lived it that's why the new birth is an experience not an experience like a sensation but an experience like a journey where you go from one place to the other like Abraham was walking along and God spoke to him and he turn this way and maybe he didn't have any sensation at that moment the as life's changed and when you look back to your life like that it comes through the mud and it comes up into the sunlight when that really maybe if you could think you would look back and say well I once was in the mud but now I've come through and I now I can see the rising of the Sun and now I can see the sunlight I can see the glory of God's creation and I said that's how it is you know think about Elijah and and and and his servant there's standing where Elijah by faith knew by revelation knew maybe not with his naturalised that he knew that the armies of the Lord where he kept around about them because he could look back into God's Word and see that that promise was there that day angels of God where you are encamped around those that believe him and he said god I pray that you'll open up my servants eyes maybe even though I believe there's a quote and ask me later and I can try to find it but himself maybe not even seeing but he prayed that God would open up his servants eyes and and there his eyes were open and that's how I believer is you go from from from gradually your eyes become open because you're beginning to see what was written into him Luke 24:44 49 says and he said unto them these are the words which I speaking to you while I was yet with you that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the law of Moses and in the prophets and in the Psalms concerning me then open to their understanding today might understand the scriptures and said unto them thus it is written and thus it but who Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations beginning at Jerusalem and ye are witnesses of these things you can be a witness to if you see God's Word being made manifest in your midst just in your life just like they saw it being manifest there and the Bible says in Galatians 4:6 7 this is that that really strange scripture that I read in in in Sunday school because ye are sons God has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying I by father but cause you our sons we know that the new birth make places your sons they put God inside of you he puts his life inside you were before you are not connected back to the eternal before you were walking in sin and shame but it says because you are sons how are you sons already how are you sons even before that life steps inside of you it's because he knew before the foundation of the world that you would accept it and he knew he says he has never has a thought he elected you by foreknowledge in his mind back then you were written that was a writing that can't be erased as a righty that he can't brother Brennan said in the Smyrna in church age he says there it is Jesus came forth died upon the cross and accomplished redemption restoring to original owner by means of purchase or paying the price and thereby placed us as sons he did not make us sons we were already his sons but he placed us as sons for as long as we were in the world in the flesh we could not be recognized as his sons we were held captive by the devil but we were sons nonetheless and here they said 'because you are sons God has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts whereby you cry father father upon whom to the spirit fall at Pentecost sons at Corinth upon sons while they heard the word ask that's really what the message is about the message is to identify you that you are in God's thinking before the foundation of the world and to reveal that to you and to show you like that story a little eagle in the barnyard that brother branham always talked about that gets misinterpreted so often about how the little chick that eagle it running around said heard that mama cry and and he realized all of a sudden that he wasn't a chicken like all the other all the other barnyard animals and he began to flap his wings and reach up to the to the heavens because he realized that there was something calling him there was something pulling him like you know the scripture says that no man can come except the father draw that's what's drawing he's drawn you bi-election that he knew you would come he knew you and why he knew you would have that desire and when you heard that Eagle cry you knew you were an Eagle to it maybe not at first maybe you stroke a little bit maybe you struggle like a little baby with baptism and things that's the name of how can the name of God be Jesus and all these different things but along along your eyes began to be open and you could see you could you realize that that God thought of you before the foundation of the world that should give comfort every Christian that God thought of you that you were in the mind of God before the foundation that that he he placed he placed you in his thinking you know what you know what that means that that that you are sons that you're in his thinking it means that and that God has he's got the right to you that God owns you first he's got the right and get the devil don't have no no claim to you he's got you God's coming to get you and it doesn't matter what the devil does he's going to get you because it's predestinated it's ordained of God he's got to predestinated a group that he's coming again he's coming to claim because you were in his mind you were in his thoughts and it's thinking because you were part of him not you the person but using the the attribute attribute form that God thinking about you start preaching the when I get a little bit technical ever Butler said in adoption he said this is my son he was lost and now he's found he was dead he's alive again talking about the prodigal son bringing forth a fatted calf the best robe a ring and put it on his finger let's no wonder when the morning stars sing together and the sons of God shouted for joy when they seen the plan of salvation God putting your name on the book before the foundation of the world he puts your name on the book and now he's putting his name in your forehead he's putting his stamp on your life he's putting his name just like just like how Adam was able to identify back there he was able to identify the nature and the characteristics of each of those animals as they walk before him now he's able to identify that the characteristic of himself is in you and he's putting his name on you because that identifies that you are manifested son of God I'm jumping ahead of myself let's read in revelation 3:12 it says him that overcometh will i make a pillar in the temple of my god and he shall no more go out and I will write upon him the name of my god and here's that three-fold mystery again veiling I'll write upon him the name of my god just because what Jesus is doing he's revealing himself he's making himself known gradually slowly because in one case you couldn't be you wouldn't be able to take it all at once the world wouldn't be able to take it all at once it would blow everybody's mind it was just it was like somebody was bringing out too much too much water will kill the plant and and so he's revealing himself slowly and it it's a secret thing it's a secret that that almost can't be fully expressed because there's a lot of that hidden mystery to you that you won't it's something personal to you and even when brother Branham was revealing the seals there were things that I almost just couldn't be fully expressed to the people and he says in Revelations 3:12 him that overcometh will i make a pillar and the temple of my god and he shall go no more out and i will write upon him the name of my god because what's written in heaven is now being written in you you are written epistles known and read of all men and he's riding upon you the name of my god and i tell you that he can't write upon you the name of my god unless you know it you have a revelation of what that name is and you can't have a revelation of that name unless you know who that person is if you've got a revelation of who that person is and understand then he's writing that name is writing the name of my god on you and then it says in the name of the city of my god so there's that Christ whether it's something with a bride coming out because a New Jerusalem is the bride news or Islam is the word that that dead bride coming out of the like like even came out of Adam and you know we've got a God's revealing himself in that threefold way that get God he's creating a paradise once again God revealing himself in the flesh of Jesus just like and revealing himself in the flesh of his bride and now revealing setting up a new lead in a place where everything is back in harmony again where people get a walk in fellowship and everything just set back in one Accord an eternal paradise which is and he says in the name of the city of my god which is New Jerusalem which cometh down out of heaven from my god and I will write upon him my new name and you know Eve had Adams name before the fall she didn't have some separate name she was she was under that umbrella of his name she knew who he was he knew who her she was and they had a revelation who God was and it was all wrapped up all wrapped up together she was walking under his name and now God is putting his name on his people he's giving them the revelation of the mystery of who he is and and and billabong said and behold of greater than all of them is here he said so she goes home and she thinks talking about that the Queen of Sheba coming to Solomon she sees he thinks now I don't know I read some of the scrolls that then men give me and it looks like if that was God if that's the God that if he's representing himself this is just a fantastic clue this is number 14 but if you want to try to find it if that's the God then if he's representing himself talking about Solomon in the way he writes his words here in that man well then surely that must be God in the way that he writes his words here in that man I think about that kind of expression that he's taking the words that were written in him before the foundation of the world and expressing them in this man and brother are called it writing the words in that man so that in a way that this Queen of Sheba that when she came up and she knew that God was identified in this man because of the manifestation of what was happening that he was able to discern the secrets and discern the wisdom of of God was able to speak things to her and she knew that that had to be God because what the brother said he writes his words here in that man and that's what's happening now to the believers he's writing his word to into his people and you know he had to have a one man message at the end make a conduit so that he could open up all the tile all the loosens together tie everything back together so that you could have a full picture of that man before the foundation of the world that you could have a full picture of this person that whose name is now applied to you and how its applied to you because you can see yourself in God's Word you have a revelation of who Jesus is and who you are because you can see he said psalm 46 8 it says sacrifice and offering that is not my ears that's their open burnt offering and sin offering and still not required required is that i lo I come in the volume of the book it is written of me I delight to do thy will oh my god yea thy law is within my heart and the volume of the book it is written of me you know it says in Revelation is that the books will be open and will be people will be judged out of the books the books are the life of the people the things that are recorded in this book brother Branham taught us that the book the Lamb's Book of Life is a historical record of how his people are being made manifest in you know what the historical record is is that that one man a one man message gets the message in and preaches it out to the people under him and they begin to preach it to and you hear from this one and hear from that one and and sons of God are being born and being manifested spiritually in the same way that children come into being naturally that's why when Abraham at Melchizedek and he said Paul talked about that situation he said they believe I paid ties while in the loins of Abraham while he was paying tithes to Melchizedek because Levi was in the loins of Abraham he was he was in that in that lineage in that situation coming forth in the same way that Renton and Melchizedek you and I were written and we've got to come forth we're coming forth thing revealed everything alright but we're identified we're identified because we can see ourselves in the world life is identified in the scripture here's the example I was looking for when you can see yourself in the scripture and one example that I was using earlier was was when the angel Gabriel came to Mary in the Book of Luke chapter one it says and the six month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee named Nazareth to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph of the house of David and the Virgin's name was Mary and the angel came into her and said held out that are highly favored the Lord is with thee blessed art thou among women and I asked this question earlier how did he know she was highly favored of course you could you could see her life she's only sixteen years old so hadn't done that much in her life she lived a clean life obviously but this angel obviously I believe that had a more comprehensive understanding of who she was and what was going to happen a little bit later on in her life and why she was highly favored why she was worth so well thought of by God and I believe it was because that God she was written in God before the foundation of the world that God knew who she was and so he he had this predestinated plan for her and when the angel Gabriel began to talk to her her eyes were open there along it along and through there through the discussion and she began to realize that the things that were spoken of in scripture about how this how that Jesus would come to life and come to the earth and how that a virgin would conceive and that that may be she may be she you know thought about all the other circumstances and things that were spoken of in Scripture and she began to realize that the scripture Dow that this angel this heavenly messenger was speaking her was talking about those things that she had read and she was going to be the manifestation of what was in the scripture and when she saw him she was troubled at his saying in casting her mind what manner of salutation this should be in the angel said unto her fear not Mary for thou has found favor with God and behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shall call his name Jesus and so Mary could see identify herself with the scripture she could look into the scripture and see herself in them think about others in the scripture also like John that said I'm the voice of one crying in the wilderness because he could look back and see the scripture talking about this person that would come to introduce the a man introduced the Messiah and he could identify himself with that that person that was spoken of in Malachi 3 in other scriptures how about Peter where Jesus said I'm going to give you the keys to the kingdom and Peter but Peter maybe at that time when they were sitting around the campfire having that discussion didn't really understand I had no idea what the keys would be but then out there on the day of Pentecost when that comforter when the interpreter stepped into em and I began to open the word and now he could look back and and identify what just what the keys were with what was already spoken of his scripture and he could say like the Prophet Joel said that God is pouring out his spirit upon all flesh he began to prophesy and speak of the things that were already written in Scripture and he could identify exactly the path to get back into him that get back into Christ repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ what about brother Branham who could look back in Scripture and identify himself in his place his purpose by looking at Malachi 4 in Revelation gen 7 Luke 2 1730 and all the other scriptures that testify that somebody's been there in the end day end times is going to introduce the Son of Man being revealed in flesh just like John ever introduced Jesus tearing in you know program kept talking about it I've got to I must decrease just like John said I'm a sea creature that he might increase I've got to go all the sea because he said in one place to both of us keeping here at the same time because he was making way for something to something greater and then so you can look back in the scripture and identify yourself with all the people that were spoken of like enid that walked with God and was found not that he walked up that pyramid of the revelation of the that's that second Bible the first Bible being written in the stars and the second Bible being written that pyramid and he walked up on the revelation of what his revelation of who Jesus Christ was and Jacob wrestling with angel and many times you might have wrestled with the angel of the Lord yourself and you can identify your experience with Jacob wrestling where they angel all these other scriptures Abraham and Sarah taking a body change before the promised son can come into manifestation Bekka hearing the message for malyasia being introduced to to her husband without even seeing him and you can look into the scripture and identify your path in your journey with all of these things that were already spoken of you can identify with the message with Malachi 4 because he said he would turn the hearts of the children to the father's and the father's to the children and you can see yourself placing that scripture and seeing yourself being turned back turned back to the original face of the Pentecostal father's and coming into the revelation of these things their brother enter talked about because we know who we are by the word by the written word and that compares back with that the written word is the the letter on the page of the Eternal Word and in 1965 brother Branham says and things that are to be said you are now made your setting in this church tonight because your duty is to express God to this nation and this people and this neighborhood where you associate before that in that quote he said the gene of your life spiritual life tonight wasn't God the Father before there was even a molecule see and you are nothing but the manifestation of the gene of life that was in God as a son of God that's what part of power to become sons of God is the power the power to make manifest that war that was recorded back there before the foundation of the world and then when you see yourself in the word and it gives you authority it gives you you're identified and you have confidence in who you are let me read this is another good one behold it greater than all of them is here and I know I'm reading some quotes but I'm not just filling time so bear with me just a second and behold it greater than all of them is here you said this is number 14 so she goes home and she thinks now I don't know I've read some of the Scrolls of that dim oh sorry I already read down okay I'll be wrapping up shortly but so it give us a one-man message a message that only one I got dealing with one man at a time and he deals with each individual individually to receive that one man message but now God is multiplying himself he's like just like he out of out of Adam Kade came Eve the bride out of out of Christ came the bride and now now if the bride under the under her messenger has the same revelation that that one man came to the was it was born into the earth to breathe to preach to bring if we are catching the message and when we catch the message and her saying the exact same thing then it becomes not just a one man message anymore but it comes it becomes a message of the bride where the bride is beginning to speak and the bride is beginning to have a voice like John said he said I heard the voice and he turned and he saw the Son of Man walking in the candlesticks it was the voice of the bride speaking because she was saying the same thing that was written before the foundation of the world she was saying the same thing and I believe that this message has this message has everything that we need to continue on this earthly journey to be successful to have power over the devil to - to make a body change there's nothing else that we need it's all packed up into a full vitamin the full full solution that we need to have everything that we need and you know what I want one thing that really struck me is thinking like that the earthly journey is it one thing that's going to happen it is it did as the word begins to be revealed to you than just the things of this earth begin to just kind of melt away and you know it it's almost a parent of paradoxical that when you start your Christian journey you know you know what you say I'm hardly not anything and and things but then there has become a change there's got to come a change later on it has a paradox that somebody a Christian that says I'm nothing without Jesus all these things that your your conversation almost there's a comes to a place where you begin to say I and my father won and that that is when to all the people in Jesus time they begin to put him away and say you you're making yourself God you're saying something so often there's got to come there's got to come a transition where you escape the earthly humility you break away from the earthly humility and you begin to say things that that from your humility from a humility standpoint would make no sense for a believer to say for somebody that says in just that's what's going to call the shut to pull away so I'm just going to finish right there so that the new sisters can go ahead and come but God is bringing us to a place where we know who we are we know that who that man is we know that we're part of him a one man message where you see yourself by faith and can look and confess and say exactly the same thing that the messenger is say knowing that your redeemer lives and that's your part of your Redeemer believe that if you just stand to your feet I'm just going to go to the Lord in prayer if you have a need tonight just lift up your hand if you just want to draw closer to him Lord we just thank you so much for your presence tonight but for your grace to us Lord to be able to peer into the scripture and see these things that have been remained hidden all these years Lord and now they're being revealed I just thank you God for opening the eyes of our hearts Lord Jesus as the song that we sing Lord God I pray Lord Jesus since you'll just bless the remainder of this service Lord and all the uplifted hands Lord God that you know ever ever need ever desire or Jesus you've known it from beginning at the beginning of the world Lord
