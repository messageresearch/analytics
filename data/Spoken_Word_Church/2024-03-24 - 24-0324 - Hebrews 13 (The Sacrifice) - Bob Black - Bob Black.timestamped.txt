[0:04] let's start off with a question and you
[0:07] don't have to say it just think think in
[0:09] your heart last time we were talking
[0:11] what what scripture did Brother Rand
[0:12] reference in his life
[0:14] story and this is a scripture he I think
[0:16] he preached his life story like four or
[0:18] five times and it's right there in
[0:20] Hebrews
[0:21] 13:10 to
[0:23] 14 now that's something to meditate on I
[0:26] I I like to encourage you to not just um
[0:30] come and listen on Sunday but when you
[0:32] go home open up your Bible and really um
[0:35] think about it why did Brother brandham
[0:37] use this scripture in his life story we
[0:40] have an altar where of they have no
[0:42] right to eat which serve the Tabernacle
[0:45] and we were talking about what that
[0:46] means last time for the bodies of those
[0:49] beasts the sacrifice was taken outside
[0:51] of the camp just like Jesus who was
[0:54] taken outside of the camp when he was
[0:56] sacrificed now crucified on the cross
[1:00] cross and for our sins and so Paul is
[1:03] saying now we got to go we got to follow
[1:05] Jesus outside the camp too bearing his
[1:09] reproach to be identified with him you
[1:11] think about Jesus carrying his cross
[1:13] outside of the camp and he's telling us
[1:15] take up your cross and follow me follow
[1:18] him outside of the camp outside of our
[1:20] own ideas and our thoughts and those
[1:21] kind of things so let's just go to the
[1:23] Lord and pray and prayer before we study
[1:26] Lord we thank you so much for your word
[1:27] that you've given into to us Lord to to
[1:30] give us encouragement and an answer for
[1:31] everything that we face every problem
[1:33] every challenge every struggle in life
[1:35] is the answer is laying here in your
[1:37] word and I pray God that you'll be with
[1:39] us today Lord as we study these things
[1:40] out this morning that you'll open our
[1:43] understanding of these scriptures Lord
[1:44] Jesus be with brother Wade as he's
[1:47] prepared and studying Lord and be with
[1:48] us today God that set our hearts and our
[1:50] minds in order Lord to receive what you
[1:53] have for us to lay our own will down to
[1:56] lay our own thoughts down lord and
[1:58] follow Jesus outside of the camp
[2:00] in your name we pray
[2:02] amen why would you want to do that why
[2:05] would you want to follow Jesus you catch
[2:07] the vision that here we have no
[2:08] continuing
[2:10] City this is not my home but my
[2:12] treasures are my treasures are somewhere
[2:15] else so much heartache and so much
[2:17] Despair and things in this life this
[2:19] ain't where our Treasures are we got a
[2:21] city that we're looking for where the
[2:23] Builder and maker is God but we seek one
[2:26] to come like Paul said now before we
[2:28] really get into the study I want just
[2:30] share some quotes from some some some
[2:33] some good oldfashioned theologians this
[2:35] first one is um uh from from Thomas Aus
[2:38] who was a a uh a a a minister in the
[2:44] 1400s during the Middle Ages and he
[2:47] wrote you can read this book The
[2:48] imitation of Christ it's got a some some
[2:51] Catholic heavy things in it about the
[2:53] Eucharist and um trinitarian doctrines
[2:56] and things like that um but there's some
[2:59] there's some excellent things in here I
[3:00] remember reading this when I was a young
[3:02] man that that that really kind of set my
[3:04] mind and and uh kind of really heavily
[3:07] influenced me about how that struggle uh
[3:10] suffering in life is is essential that
[3:13] God will allow you to go through things
[3:16] to bring you to a place where he can
[3:17] actually deal deal with you and and so
[3:21] there's some really really this this
[3:23] book was a a big influence on kind of
[3:27] the way the way that I view some things
[3:30] and so Thomas Aus he said all the evils
[3:32] in the world come from this that men do
[3:35] not know how to be content in their own
[3:38] chamber the one who has conquered his
[3:40] own
[3:42] self-will is greater than one who has
[3:45] defeated a thousand times a thousand
[3:49] men so we're talking about following
[3:51] Jesus outside the camp to die to your
[3:53] own self-will just like he died he gave
[3:56] up everything for us absolutely now
[3:59] that's kind of the mode that we're
[4:00] talking talking about as as we study
[4:02] this thing out and and another quote
[4:05] that maybe we'll Circle back to later is
[4:07] Martin Luther said the sin underneath
[4:10] all our sins is to trust the LIE of the
[4:14] serpent that we cannot trust the love
[4:17] and grace of Christ and must take
[4:20] matters into our own hands now if you've
[4:23] ever wondered what the LIE is that the
[4:25] serpent told Eve that sums it up the LIE
[4:29] is
[4:30] that you can't you can't really trust
[4:32] that he's the same yesterday today and
[4:34] forever you can't have confidence in him
[4:37] so you got to take matters into your own
[4:39] hands now you know sometimes as
[4:41] ministers we we kind of struggle on how
[4:43] to frame it up just right and you know I
[4:45] I I I've been kind of belaboring the
[4:47] point sometimes with your kids and
[4:49] things you got to take your hands off
[4:51] and that's a little bit difficult to
[4:53] articulate right cuz you don't you got
[4:54] to set a standard in your home you got
[4:56] to you know you you you can't let them
[4:58] get away with doing things they
[4:59] shouldn't whatnot but really the essence
[5:01] of the thing is we got to have trust
[5:04] faith that he's the same yesterday today
[5:07] and forever and when we really begin to
[5:10] doubt that we'll do like Eve and put our
[5:13] own will and our own hand to it because
[5:15] that's really the situation that Eve
[5:17] found herself in I don't believe that
[5:20] God is going to do it so I got to do it
[5:25] now that's that's the battle that's
[5:27] that's where really if you look at it
[5:29] the greatest evil is your self-will is
[5:33] when you put yourself and that's that
[5:36] the devil there in the garden he's
[5:37] influencing Eve he's influencing Eve to
[5:40] inject her own will into it and say I
[5:43] can't trust God anymore I got to do it
[5:45] now that's where that's where if you can
[5:47] lay your own self- will down and lay
[5:50] your own will down and do like Christ
[5:53] take up your cross and follow him then
[5:56] you can see God begin to work right so
[5:59] that's what Paul is saying in verse if
[6:00] you go on to verse 12 wherefore Jesus
[6:03] also that he might sanctify the people
[6:04] with his own blood suffered without the
[6:07] gate let us go forth therefore unto him
[6:09] without the camp bearing his reproach I
[6:11] got I got to follow Jesus outside the
[6:13] camp outside of all of the ideas of the
[6:17] day and my ideas outside of the camp to
[6:21] go to his Camp I want to be in his Camp
[6:24] I don't want to be in my camp and that's
[6:26] where that's where in every aspect of
[6:28] our life when you got a problem in your
[6:30] home with your children or with your
[6:32] wife or your husband sometimes we we we
[6:36] we forget that we've got a God that we
[6:38] can turn it to and we'll try to tackle
[6:41] things with our own will and our own
[6:43] ideas and you know maybe maybe maybe you
[6:46] just youve put your own will into your
[6:48] children so much until you're just
[6:50] badgering them constantly you need to be
[6:52] a Christian you need to be a Christian
[6:54] but remember you can turn to God in
[6:56] prayer and get down on your knees and
[6:59] with faith and watch God begin to move
[7:03] now that's that's the battle your will
[7:06] versus God's will for here we have no
[7:08] continuing City but we seek one to come
[7:10] now think now let's let's actually put
[7:12] ourselves in in the place of somebody
[7:14] following Jesus outside of the city
[7:17] Jesus you if you were behind him you'd
[7:19] see him struggling beating struggling to
[7:22] go out of the city going he got to go
[7:23] outside the gates now you got to go
[7:25] outside the gates too yes to to bear his
[7:28] reproach and all all of the you look
[7:31] around at people mocking him and and all
[7:33] the strange ideas of the Pharisees and
[7:35] Sadducees and they all had their
[7:37] different ideas and different doctrines
[7:38] and things now that's where we can get
[7:40] so caught up sometimes so so much of the
[7:43] Christian journey is like a mind battle
[7:45] and if you can frame up your thinking in
[7:47] the right way that our thinking that's
[7:50] that's why I was saying earlier it's not
[7:52] to be against everything but to be for
[7:55] Jesus yes we're following Jesus and you
[7:58] can start being now the reason why this
[8:00] is so important is
[8:02] because this is how this is how people
[8:04] look at things they'll see a young
[8:06] person go to camp and they'll get a real
[8:08] blessing and they come back and I I had
[8:10] an experience may maybe they didn't get
[8:12] born again but they had an experience
[8:14] they recognized God is real but because
[8:16] somebody's against going to camps that's
[8:18] what they're
[8:19] against same thing with with laying on
[8:22] of hands I was hearing a preacher preach
[8:24] about somebody in their Church came up
[8:25] they were uh they were struggling with
[8:28] cancer and they wanted somebody to pray
[8:29] for them and they come up to the
[8:31] preacher but because that church was
[8:33] against laying on of hands they were so
[8:35] strongly against laying on of hands that
[8:37] they told the sister to go back and go
[8:39] go sit down in your in your Pew where
[8:41] you came from it's because they in their
[8:43] mind they become so against everything
[8:46] that they forgot to be for something
[8:49] when you see when you see somebody
[8:50] getting a blessing be for it be I I'm
[8:54] for chains coming off I'm for somebody
[8:57] being delivered and you can begin to
[8:59] frame up you the way that you think so
[9:01] just like the Pharisees they were so
[9:03] against somebody being healed on or so
[9:06] against somebody doing anything on the
[9:08] Sabbath until when somebody was healed
[9:10] on the Sabbath that was how they framed
[9:12] up their world view and they were just
[9:13] I'm well I'm against that but what about
[9:16] what about being for somebody being
[9:17] healed or for somebody being delivered
[9:19] or for something good so as you follow
[9:22] Jesus outside of the camp we're not it's
[9:25] not that we're you know you can you
[9:27] there's so many strange doctrines
[9:28] there's so many things you can make a
[9:29] long list I'm against that I'm against
[9:31] that I'm against that I'm against that
[9:32] but if you're for Jesus all of those
[9:35] things will take care of themselves you
[9:37] just follow after Jesus because that
[9:39] that scripture we keep hammering on that
[9:41] that we got a promise that he will lead
[9:43] and guide us into all truth so you just
[9:45] keep your eyes on Jesus amen and all the
[9:47] things there's so many doctrines that
[9:49] you can list out I like the doctrine
[9:51] that irenius follow uh the gnosticism I
[9:54] can barely understand what even gnos
[9:56] what was irenius battling about it's
[9:59] such a complex Doctrine so you my point
[10:01] is you can make a list of all these
[10:02] things to be against but let's be for
[10:05] something for something is where you
[10:07] kind of you're optimistic that God is
[10:09] leading us and changing us or you can
[10:11] have that negative uh or finger pointing
[10:13] I don't like nothing I don't like
[10:15] anything and you're just against
[10:17] everything but I want to be for
[10:18] something so brother Bram said in going
[10:20] beyond the camps he said now watch what
[10:22] he says to do now in closing put out of
[10:25] the camp where the sacrifices was burned
[10:29] that's that's where he belonged he was
[10:31] the sacrifice amen now so the sacrifice
[10:35] the animal sacrifice was taken outside
[10:37] of the camp and it was burned so Jesus
[10:39] is the sacrifice now if you're going to
[10:41] follow him that means you have to
[10:43] sacrifice your own self-will too he was
[10:46] the sacrifice for you and now you got to
[10:48] lay down your own will and there's the
[10:50] struggle there's the struggle now now so
[10:53] brother Brown said and going beyond the
[10:54] camp he said now brother sister do you
[10:56] know that each one of you all must
[10:58] sacrifice
[10:59] now the Bible says that he's made us
[11:01] Kings and Priests and a priest is going
[11:04] to
[11:04] sacrifice you must be God's sacrifice
[11:07] sacrifice the things of the world
[11:10] sacrifice your own pleasures of this
[11:11] world sacrifice the things of the world
[11:14] you know the reason that people won't do
[11:17] it and he doesn't really answer that
[11:19] question outright but that's a good
[11:21] question to ask why do people are not
[11:24] why are not they willing to sacrifice I
[11:27] think if we could really answer that
[11:28] question that that would answer a lot of
[11:30] the questions that are posed in this day
[11:33] why well we're not asked brother Ram
[11:36] said we're not asked to manufacture
[11:38] something we're asked to Bear the fruit
[11:40] of the spirit that is the inside of the
[11:43] sheep what he is on the inside makes the
[11:46] wool on the outside and when a man has
[11:49] got Christ on the inside it makes him
[11:52] Christlike on the outside not some
[11:55] artificial put on so sacrifice
[11:58] sacrifices every every everything about
[12:00] our Christian Journey about the church
[12:03] it's all based on
[12:05] sacrifice if you want to see your
[12:07] children saved if you want to see some
[12:09] something real happen in their life then
[12:11] You' got to start with your own self to
[12:12] lay down your own self-will start
[12:15] cleaning up your house set an atmosphere
[12:17] in your home where your children can
[12:19] actually see God there and see God
[12:21] moving see signs and wonders following
[12:24] in your life make make them thirsty see
[12:27] them let them see you reading the Bible
[12:29] Bible and hear you praying in the dead
[12:31] of the night and actually see you living
[12:33] it because that's that's really the
[12:35] problem the problem is is where is the
[12:38] sacrifice people are not they're willing
[12:40] to point out faults and flaws and other
[12:42] people that they're really not willing
[12:44] to make a sacrifice and their own life
[12:47] and lay down their own will and try to
[12:51] get you know really get active about
[12:53] trying to get rid of things in their
[12:55] life the whole Christian journey is
[12:58] about sacrificing that's why in the in
[12:59] the Old Testament you look at like this
[13:01] diagram of the of Solomon's Temple and
[13:04] everything was about sacrifice that
[13:07] altar in the outer Court where they
[13:08] brought an animal and sacrificed it then
[13:11] that that H that the in the Holy place
[13:13] the the where the priest would would
[13:15] offer up incense he'd bring in uh all
[13:18] all of the things there everything was
[13:20] about laying something down and giving
[13:22] something up you know there maybe a line
[13:26] of people however long wait to bring
[13:29] their sacrifices every day peace
[13:31] offerings and sin offerings and things
[13:33] because they're coming to lay something
[13:35] down and it it's all about sacrifice and
[13:39] so when PA Paul says in Hebrews 13:15 he
[13:41] says by him therefore let us offer the
[13:44] sacrifice of praise to God continually
[13:47] that is the fruit of our lips giving
[13:49] thanks to his name and in verse 16 but
[13:52] to do good and to communicate forget not
[13:54] for with such
[13:56] sacrifices God is well pleased
[13:59] he's talking about sacrificing and see
[14:01] some some sometimes we're we're so
[14:03] caught up in oursel that we forget to
[14:05] praise God and thank God and acknowledge
[14:07] Him for for giving us a job even before
[14:10] we eat we bow our head and thank God for
[14:12] even giving us food on the table and all
[14:15] those things are sacrifice it's a
[14:16] sacrifice when you lift your hand up in
[14:18] church or when you say Amen to the
[14:20] preacher because you're sacrificing your
[14:22] own will maybe maybe in you're sitting
[14:23] here you're embarrassed to be to be like
[14:27] different or you're embarrassed to say a
[14:29] men or be vocal about your appreciation
[14:31] of the word but all of those things are
[14:35] sacrifices and so it's the father in it
[14:37] suffices brother BR said now back to
[14:40] Cain and Abel when Cain worshiped he
[14:42] built an altar he sacrificed he worship
[14:45] God but that wasn't enough it was
[14:48] beautiful no doubt the flowers and
[14:50] things that grows in the field and he
[14:51] decorated his altar why soon as soon as
[14:54] Easter come across the Nations there'll
[14:56] be Millions dollars spent for Easter
[14:59] flowers that go on the altar well God
[15:01] don't care about that Easter flower on
[15:02] the altar he wants you on the altar
[15:06] you're the person for the altar not your
[15:07] flower or your money he wants you the
[15:10] altar was built for you to sacrifice
[15:13] your own will to his
[15:16] will now you really really I've been
[15:19] really meditating on this all week what
[15:22] good does it do like Cain to bring all
[15:24] of these nice things to come to church
[15:26] and have stained glass windows and all
[15:27] those things what's what was missing in
[15:29] K's life was sacrifice what good does it
[15:31] do to come to a church and say well I'm
[15:33] a good message believer and I I you know
[15:36] understand the doct when you're not
[15:37] willing to sacrifice what good does it
[15:39] do to say I'm a good Christian or
[15:41] whatever whatever if you're not willing
[15:42] to sacrifice and be honest and have
[15:45] integrity and be a upstanding Christian
[15:48] and deal with one another in the right
[15:50] way and lay down your own life so that
[15:52] some other some you know some somebody
[15:53] else can can benefit and and be good to
[15:56] one another what good is all these
[15:57] things what if you're not willing to
[15:59] sacrifice sacrifice the way that you
[16:00] think sacrifice your Doctrine for God am
[16:03] sacri when you go to to the to the pool
[16:06] and and are baptized in the name of the
[16:07] Lord Jesus Christ it's a type you're
[16:10] you're laying down your own life and
[16:11] going down in the water and death to be
[16:14] raised up in newness of life because
[16:16] you're sacrificing your life to Christ
[16:19] you're sacrificing yourself and
[16:21] everything everything is a dying out
[16:24] that's why uh I I love this story that
[16:26] uh in the Bible of Jacob wrestling Ling
[16:29] with the angel and you really think
[16:30] about what what Jacob was doing when he
[16:32] was wrestling with the angel he's he's
[16:33] dying out to himself are these things
[16:37] that have been preached are they true
[16:39] are these things that I've heard that's
[16:41] why brother Brown when he was when he
[16:42] was preaching this in spir spiritual
[16:44] Amnesia he said I was with Jacob that
[16:46] night when he wrestled all night with
[16:47] the angel I've wrestled
[16:50] myself I know what he went through so I
[16:53] wrestled with Jacob the same time he did
[16:56] for I am his
[16:57] brother I I love how the the Bible is
[17:00] like a road map of your own life yes and
[17:03] when you begin to read the Bible like
[17:04] that you can identify yourself with
[17:06] these stories it it it it it's actually
[17:10] it's something Supernatural is happening
[17:13] you can look back in your life and say I
[17:15] I remember I remember when you know uh
[17:19] people mocked and scorned like David or
[17:21] you know I I remember I remember when I
[17:23] was on the ash sheep like job I remember
[17:26] when I prayed all night wrestled all
[17:29] night like Jacob did there at the river
[17:31] before he met Esau I remember and if you
[17:33] can remember and really identify
[17:35] yourself remember when remember when you
[17:37] died out and and that's the whole point
[17:40] maybe of this little Sunday school
[17:42] lesson God will bring us like Thomas
[17:44] Thomas AA said in the imitation of
[17:46] Christ he will bring you so low he will
[17:49] bring you to the bottom of the ash sheep
[17:51] he will bring you down so that you
[17:54] really die out like Jesus did In The
[17:56] Garden of Gethsemane he will bring you
[17:58] maybe he'll take away all your friends
[18:00] and make you feel like you're completely
[18:02] alone something horrible will happen to
[18:04] your life emotional turmoil and Trauma
[18:08] so that God can get you to where he can
[18:10] really begin to use you CU you've got to
[18:12] die out to your self-will and he can't
[18:15] use you if your self-will is still
[18:18] remaining you got to get rid of your
[18:21] self-will and and we don't get rid of
[18:23] our self- will I'm not going to get rid
[18:25] of my self-will because somebody's mean
[18:27] to me or hurtful
[18:29] it's because God God is doing the work
[18:32] God is doing it God is allowing things
[18:34] to happen in our life to mold us you
[18:37] think about all the all the horrible
[18:38] things that happened in Martin Luther's
[18:40] life and John Wesley's life brother
[18:42] brandom's life where he washed his F his
[18:45] wife and his daughter die and had that
[18:48] horrible sickness in Africa when when he
[18:50] disobeyed the Lord and all the thing to
[18:52] it's God bringing him to a place where
[18:54] he can really begin to use him cuz you
[18:57] got to take up your cross and follow
[19:00] him and brother Ram would say in
[19:02] questions and answers law having a
[19:03] shadow he said now now here's the
[19:05] question wouldn't you all like to have a
[19:08] real Bible
[19:11] Church a real Bible Church where all the
[19:14] spiritual gifts were set in order
[19:16] everything making manifest just exactly
[19:18] the way it should be wouldn't that be
[19:22] wonderful wouldn't that be
[19:24] wonderful now he's he's given the recipe
[19:27] now you're going to have to sacrifice
[19:30] not
[19:31] money you're going to have to sacrifice
[19:34] what some of your own
[19:37] ideas you're going to have to sacrifice
[19:39] some time in prayer yes sir you're going
[19:42] to have to sacrifice maybe a stubborn
[19:45] will to break down in
[19:48] humility you're going to have the whole
[19:50] Christian move is
[19:53] sacrificial and then he quotes that
[19:55] scripture he that will follow me let him
[19:58] deny himself take up his cross and
[20:01] follow me daily is that right how often
[20:04] do you have to
[20:05] sacrifice every day Paul said he died
[20:09] daily every day he
[20:13] died so let's see let's see what we got
[20:16] a sacrifice we got five minutes left so
[20:19] I'm not really going to get in but I
[20:20] want to go through and really dive into
[20:22] the things that we've got to lay down
[20:25] because if you really can sacrifice oh
[20:28] then you'll have a church where God can
[20:30] move a church that will be in unity a
[20:34] church that will stand together a home
[20:36] that will stand together a family that
[20:38] will stand together in unity why because
[20:40] it's it's you're laying down you're
[20:43] laying down all these things that I'm
[20:45] about to cover brother R said oh Lord
[20:48] just once more he said the trouble of it
[20:50] is the church today is not like Samson
[20:52] they're not willing to pay the price now
[20:55] I I know maybe looking out this this
[20:58] might be be getting a little bit bored
[20:59] and everything but I'm telling you this
[21:00] is the secret this is the reason this is
[21:04] the reason why a lot of young people
[21:06] don't want the want the message this is
[21:08] the reason why you look around why why
[21:10] why are these things happening it's
[21:13] because there's a lack of sacrifice
[21:16] right that's right they're not willing
[21:18] to pay the price Samson prayed right
[21:21] when he prayed Lord let me die with the
[21:23] Enemy he knowed it was going to cost him
[21:25] something he know it was going to cost
[21:27] something it's going to cost you
[21:29] something it's going to cost me
[21:30] something your social prestige your
[21:33] place and position in the denomination
[21:36] Lord let me die then I see your purpose
[21:39] he knowed it was going to cost him
[21:41] something you must be ready to die out
[21:44] to your enemy to get in the blessings of
[21:46] God Samson was willing to pay the price
[21:49] to get the power of God again upon him
[21:51] he was willing to do it are you are you
[21:54] willing to sacrifice your television
[21:56] programs now see that's that's one of
[21:59] the problems with with young people in
[22:00] the church their CH their parents are
[22:02] not willing to sacrifice and get rid of
[22:05] all the all the anime and all the
[22:07] nastiness that their kids are watching
[22:09] they're just not willing to sacrifice
[22:10] and clean up the place and you know it
[22:13] used to be as wrong for us to go to the
[22:15] movies but now the devil put one over on
[22:17] you brought it right in the house with
[22:19] you that's right and not just in the
[22:21] house now but on our phones and on our
[22:24] watches and on our computers at work and
[22:26] on your computers at work and everything
[22:28] and and if we're not willing to
[22:30] sacrifice it will begin to have an
[22:31] effect on us and change our mind instead
[22:33] of the word so what do we sacrifice and
[22:36] you got to sacrifice your personal
[22:38] desires and self-will then said Jesus
[22:40] unto his disciples If any man will come
[22:42] after me let him deny himself and again
[22:45] in Matthew chapter 16 for whosoever will
[22:48] save his life shall lose it and
[22:50] whosoever will lose his life for my sake
[22:53] shall find it it's about laying our life
[22:56] down yes we got to sacrifice our sinful
[22:59] behaviors and attitudes and Paul said in
[23:02] Romans he said for if you live after the
[23:04] flesh you shall die but if you through
[23:06] the spirit do mortify the Deeds of the
[23:08] body ye shall live we got to lay our lay
[23:13] our own our flesh down so much until
[23:16] it's like killing it so it has no effect
[23:20] on our life in Colossians he said
[23:23] mortify Therefore your members which are
[23:25] upon the Earth fornication uncleanness
[23:28] in ordinate affection evil concupisent
[23:31] and covetousness which is idolatry you
[23:35] know what Paul's really hitting at there
[23:36] is that you know we can come to church
[23:39] and have all these things laying there
[23:40] in our life and these things that he's
[23:43] listing are terrible and you think it's
[23:46] terrible but yet people will come to
[23:47] church with fornication and adultery and
[23:50] horrible things laying there in our life
[23:52] and actually think that they're born
[23:54] again and will not lay their life down
[23:57] and allow God to begin to move in their
[23:58] life now that's that's what the
[24:00] preaching of the Gospel is really to do
[24:02] to expose in your mind that you ain't
[24:04] Born Again people will battle it out and
[24:06] get upset with the ministry because he's
[24:08] calling it out but we're not here to to
[24:11] to you know hurt feelings but to see
[24:13] Soul's life the whole purpose of the of
[24:16] the church is to see somebody sacrifice
[24:19] themselves and accept the sacrifice that
[24:22] Jesus made that's why Paul's listing out
[24:25] all these things if we can if we can
[24:26] realize if we can realize that there's
[24:28] something lacking in our life and be
[24:30] willing to lay our own life down on our
[24:33] own ideas and accept what Christ has
[24:37] done Mor what's mortification of our
[24:39] Deeds mean
[24:42] self-examination search me oh God and
[24:44] know my heart is what David said in the
[24:45] Book of
[24:46] Psalms it means continual repentance
[24:49] every day to acknowledge what you've did
[24:50] WR constantly be examining yourself am I
[24:53] am I re am I do I really have the right
[24:55] motives do I really have the right
[24:57] objectives am I the problem and rely on
[25:01] the Holy Ghost now that's what Eve's
[25:03] problem was she forgot to trust in in
[25:05] God this I say then walk in the spirit
[25:08] and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the
[25:09] flesh is what Paul said in Galatians cuz
[25:12] if you're trusting in God and you're
[25:13] walking in the spirit and you're you're
[25:15] you're not letting your relationship
[25:17] with God go cold
[25:20] then your flesh will truly be
[25:23] mortified and seek to distance yourself
[25:26] from the world in Romans chapter 12 Paul
[25:28] said be not conformed to this world but
[25:31] be transformed by the renewing of your
[25:33] mind that you may prove what is that
[25:36] good and acceptable and perfect will of
[25:40] God and what he's saying here as we
[25:42] close up right here as we're running out
[25:44] of time he's saying when when you don't
[25:47] try to get as far away from the world as
[25:49] you can try to get as far away from the
[25:52] things of the world and anything that
[25:53] will distance yourself from God and get
[25:55] get close to God cuz he said if if you
[25:58] draw nine to me I will draw nine to
[26:01] you when you're so get so caught up in
[26:04] the world that you're not willing to lay
[26:06] your life down things just don't work
[26:08] right that's right God bless you Saints
[26:14] amen
