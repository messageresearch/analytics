[12:21] there is a land
[12:24] that jesus went to prepare
[12:29] by his own hand

[15:51] we'll look into psalms chapter 34
[15:55] and before we uh
[15:59] we'll go with the scripture not
[16:03] brother louise is preaching for brother
[16:05] martin
[16:06] and i don't know what brother martin's
[16:09] last name is to you
[16:11] brother martin from varela
[16:14] in little and uh lawrenceville
[16:17] said brother louise he sent us a message
[16:20] earlier told us and he would be down
[16:22] there so we won't
[16:23] remember brother luis and brother martin
[16:25] and the church down there and
[16:29] before we go to the scripture i got a
[16:34] as a the
[16:38] family that uh richard and i
[16:42] went to school with this uh
[16:45] family some of the kids and
[16:49] one of the daughters is named sunshine
[16:51] and she graduated with richard and
[16:53] um she graduated early in school she's
[16:57] my age but she graduated richard but
[17:00] sunshine's got a little boy named nahum
[17:04] and i just want to
[17:07] remember this family
[17:10] sunshine's husband has brain cancer
[17:14] and then a week or so ago again exactly
[17:16] when she had a miscarriage
[17:18] the day after that nahum had a tree limb
[17:21] fall on him
[17:22] and he's in the hospital right now he
[17:25] has shearing of the brain
[17:28] and they can't do a lot of testing on
[17:30] him because every time they try to do a
[17:31] lot of testing on him
[17:33] he becomes unstable and so
[17:40] y'all just remember them
[17:46] and uh i got brother brown always told
[17:49] us
[17:49] we need to enter in for people
[17:53] and so just remember them and as a
[17:56] brother
[17:57] from nepal he's i i got into
[18:00] he got in touch with me through facebook
[18:02] and he's
[18:04] i don't know how many times he's texted
[18:06] me and tried to call me through
[18:08] facebook messenger and everything but i
[18:10] put him on youtube of our church and
[18:13] man i don't know how many times i've
[18:14] gotten he just continually calls
[18:18] texts and everything but he's all
[18:19] excited but uh
[18:22] i put him on the on the youtube channel
[18:24] next thing you know he's texting me back
[18:25] said who is wade dale
[18:27] was explaining because you know on
[18:28] youtube they don't tell you everything
[18:30] it's not like the church website but
[18:32] anyway he was all excited about brother
[18:34] brother wade's sermon the other
[18:35] wednesday night so uh
[18:38] there's two sisters down there one of
[18:40] them has had a stroke and the other one
[18:42] has cancer and she's
[18:43] facing operations and he said he asked
[18:46] for us to pray
[18:47] so you all just remember those two
[18:48] sisters and and then
[18:51] a friend of mine it was a former
[18:53] co-worker he
[18:55] named daryl he passed away several years
[18:56] ago
[18:58] and uh still really close to his family
[19:01] his family means
[19:02] a lot to me and his daughter summer just
[19:06] went through her second back surgery
[19:07] she's only like 22 or 23 so
[19:12] she has a lot of a lot of
[19:15] issues but you know what god's still
[19:18] greater than all our problems
[19:20] any problem that we face anybody faces
[19:24] god's bigger than any mountain that we
[19:26] can or cannot see as the song says so
[19:30] you know i look sometimes i put people
[19:32] in my in my bible
[19:35] i write little notes and i've stuck nope
[19:37] pads and
[19:38] little post-it notes in my bible and you
[19:40] know
[19:46] i look back and i see people's names
[19:48] that
[19:49] you know i god
[19:54] you know the they put them god put some
[19:56] on your heart

[20:21] and you know the the doctors were really
[20:24] surprised at
[20:25] how well everything went and you know
[20:28] it's just that you know
[20:31] it's the power of prayer and you have
[20:33] faith to believe and god can
[20:34] can do things and you just you sometimes
[20:36] you you
[20:39] you look back and you thank god all the
[20:41] times you know that you've seen
[20:43] little notes that you you've prayed for

[24:37] y'all pray pray for me tonight but uh
[24:41] it's gonna be a little bit a little bit
[24:44] different
[24:45] maybe tonight
[24:48] because i want to talk about something
[24:50] that that i like to do
[24:53] i know it's going to be a little
[24:54] shocking to y'all but i won't talk about
[24:58] eating
[25:00] i know that's a little shocking maybe
[25:02] some of you but
[25:03] uh i didn't i didn't just
[25:08] get get to looking like this just
[25:10] haphazardly there's a little
[25:12] takes takes work takes dedication
[25:16] it takes a little you know richard used
[25:18] to tell everybody when i was
[25:20] growing up they had always asked me why
[25:22] he was so skinny and i was so big
[25:24] because
[25:24] richard say before i could get seconds
[25:26] aaron was having thirty-fourths
[25:31] i said well i'm sorry you're slow he
[25:33] said he just pushed me out of the way
[25:39] but you know you know i want to i want
[25:43] to talk about this right here because
[25:45] you know david is here and you know he's
[25:48] reading about
[25:49] the things that he has been through in
[25:51] his life and
[25:52] you know he said i sought the lord and
[25:55] he heard me and he delivered me from all
[25:56] my fears
[26:01] and he said this poor man cried and the
[26:03] lord heard him
[26:04] and saved him from all of his troubles
[26:06] and you know he's talking about
[26:08] all the things that that he had been
[26:09] through and you know the things that he
[26:11] had
[26:11] that he had experienced in his life and
[26:13] he stood there and he said oh taste and
[26:15] see that the lord is good
[26:18] you know if you've ever been through if
[26:20] you've ever had an experience of
[26:21] something you know you just can't wait
[26:23] to share it with somebody
[26:24] else you know you just it's it's an
[26:26] experience that you know
[26:28] you can talk to people about it but you
[26:30] know what you want people to experience
[26:31] it yourself
[26:33] you know uh as as uh
[26:38] wade always talks about german chocolate
[26:41] cake
[26:42] well you know i mean some people like
[26:44] german chocolate cake but some people
[26:46] don't
[26:48] but you know some people you know you
[26:50] can you can talk to people about it
[26:52] and you can show it to them but you know
[26:53] what some people they don't they don't
[26:55] know
[26:55] unless they experience that how good it
[26:58] is
[27:00] you know sometimes people you sit there
[27:02] and you know it's it's so
[27:04] it's you know when they start eating
[27:05] like brother dale likes to do sometimes
[27:07] you know
[27:07] he gets in there and you know he'll
[27:08] he'll tell you about how terrible that
[27:10] banana pudding is that y'all don't want
[27:12] any of it
[27:12] and he keeps saying this is not good
[27:15] this is not
[27:16] y'all don't want any of this
[27:20] see using a little that reverse
[27:22] psychology because you know
[27:24] but you know you know in times you know
[27:26] people they begin to express these
[27:28] things but you know what they want you
[27:29] to experience that too
[27:31] you know lots of times you know when
[27:33] somebody has something that's good you
[27:35] know
[27:35] and as the story goes you know they they
[27:38] put a
[27:38] they put a craving on you yeah why
[27:41] because
[27:42] it's what they've experienced what
[27:44] they're having you know it looks good to
[27:45] them
[27:46] you know somebody will come by and
[27:48] they'll have something that you want
[27:50] and you know it's like boy that looks
[27:52] good or boy that smells good well you
[27:53] know the thing is is if you don't
[27:55] experience you know because they can
[27:57] tell you how good it is but you've got
[27:58] to experience that for yourself
[28:00] you know brother branham said for us as
[28:02] christians he said how can we reach out
[28:04] to those
[28:05] in the world how can we reach out to our
[28:07] brothers and sisters he said it was very
[28:09] very simple he said all you got to do is
[28:10] be salty
[28:14] see another reference to food
[28:18] y'all might not cough that but but it
[28:20] goes back to eating but to have an
[28:22] experience
[28:22] and david said oh taste and see that the
[28:24] lord is good i want you to have an
[28:26] experience like i've had can you have it
[28:29] can you talk about the
[28:30] same experience that i mean god is
[28:32] coming and all these great things that
[28:33] happened to me
[28:34] when you come to and you see the things
[28:36] that david has come through and if it
[28:37] wasn't for the grace of god david would
[28:39] have never made it
[28:40] but you know what david was anointed
[28:45] god came to david and anointed him to be
[28:48] king and all the other
[28:50] problems that he had all the faults and
[28:51] failures that david had
[28:53] no matter what took place you know what
[28:55] god still had him to be king
[28:57] and he still had a place and he still
[28:59] had a purpose in his life no matter what
[29:00] david done
[29:02] and god had a place to put him and even
[29:05] you know
[29:05] even even though he had faults and
[29:07] failures and yet god still said
[29:09] he was a man after his own heart
[29:12] you know and so many times we can look
[29:14] at our lives and you know we
[29:16] we can look at things and say well you
[29:17] know we can always see
[29:19] look in the mirror and we always see our
[29:20] faults and our failures and everybody
[29:22] else can always see our felts
[29:23] and faults and failures and our issues
[29:25] and our problems well you know what
[29:27] everybody has those things but the
[29:29] problem is is is
[29:30] you know as as brother always talked
[29:32] about you know as a brother
[29:33] a man that that is really a holy ghost
[29:36] filled man
[29:36] you know if he falls down he doesn't
[29:38] stay down you know the thing is is the
[29:41] grace of god is there for you to get
[29:42] back up and to continue to run
[29:44] you know it's it's not it's not it's not
[29:46] for him that will it or him or rather
[29:48] but he said is god it shows mercy to a
[29:50] person to run this race
[29:51] you can't do it on your own you're not
[29:53] ever going to be worthy enough to do it
[29:55] but you know what
[29:56] but somebody's made you worthy to do
[29:58] this and you know you've had an
[29:59] e-there's an
[30:00] experience to have you can fall but you
[30:03] don't care
[30:03] do you understand that god's grace is
[30:05] there for you to get up and keep going
[30:07] not to go the same route you've been
[30:08] going not to be the same person that
[30:10] you've been
[30:11] but to be a new person in christ jesus
[30:13] to be a new man
[30:14] a new creature in christ jesus that's
[30:17] what god wants us to be
[30:21] oh taste and see that the lord is good
[30:25] many people you know
[30:28] they just go through the same thing and
[30:31] they
[30:32] and they experience the same things well
[30:34] you know
[30:35] it's time to have a different experience
[30:38] have a different change
[30:41] you know one of the one of the things
[30:43] that i was i was thinking about was
[30:46] you know we've we've had in in this epi
[30:50] this pandemic this this all this time
[30:53] that we've been going through and how
[30:54] everything's messed up and you know
[30:56] one of the things that we see in this in
[30:59] this pandemic having this
[31:01] this virus you know it changes people's
[31:04] taste you know it it affects people you
[31:09] know that's one of the things that
[31:10] changes is
[31:11] people are not able to taste and you
[31:15] know
[31:15] and and we see how today in the in the
[31:17] hour that we live you know
[31:19] people have always we've had so many
[31:21] people that that have you see people
[31:22] that have walked in the in the word
[31:24] and they they walked in things and you
[31:26] know and they they go through the same
[31:27] thing and you know
[31:28] it goes through the it's the same
[31:30] process
[31:33] but then all of a sudden you know
[31:34] there's a there's something that takes
[31:36] place
[31:37] well you know some people what what has
[31:39] happened is you know
[31:40] they're just going along with the flow
[31:43] or they they just they're just
[31:44] having a mental uh episode you know it's
[31:48] just
[31:49] all in their mind because you know you
[31:52] you can't you can't live this life you
[31:54] can't be a christian and live a
[31:55] christian life
[31:56] by having just a mental faith it just
[31:58] can't it just can't be
[31:59] you know i try to live just try to live
[32:01] this in myself in my humanity
[32:04] i'll never i'll never advance in this
[32:06] christian walk i'll never
[32:07] overcome just being just as a normal
[32:10] person
[32:12] but you know many people that that's the
[32:13] way they've done and it's like why well
[32:15] because you know
[32:16] they've had some kind of experience at
[32:18] at some point in their life you know
[32:20] something's happened you know they've
[32:21] they've had some kind of emotion
[32:23] or something that's taken place but you
[32:25] know what that's not going to carry you
[32:26] all the way because you know they're
[32:28] somewhere along the way
[32:29] people have gotten off track people have
[32:31] gotten where they where they got
[32:33] twisted in the word something that's
[32:35] happened to them and they've gotten away
[32:36] from it
[32:37] but you know the thing is you've got to
[32:39] come back to because there's only one
[32:40] person that's going to lead you and
[32:42] that's jesus christ
[32:44] and you know and if jesus christ you've
[32:46] always got to come back to the word
[32:49] it's the word that brings you through
[32:54] you know is here in the
[32:58] in the message speak to the rock
[33:01] brother man was is speaking of of moses
[33:07] and the children of israel in their
[33:08] journey
[33:12] and you know god put him on this journey
[33:14] and you know he was going to feed him on
[33:15] this journey
[33:17] and you know he was going to take care
[33:18] of them all the way through their
[33:20] journey
[33:20] you know they didn't have to worry about
[33:22] nothing right
[33:24] you know i mean they had somebody to
[33:26] lead them
[33:28] they had a they had a cloud by day they
[33:30] had a pillar of fire by night
[33:33] all they had to do is line up
[33:36] by the word that was given by the
[33:38] prophet that's all they had to do
[33:42] when they were down there in egypt and
[33:44] they were crying out for
[33:45] a deliverer and god told
[33:48] and he found go and talk to moses and he
[33:51] told moses he said i've heard the cry of
[33:53] my people by the reason of their task
[33:55] masters
[33:55] and he told them i said now it's you to
[33:57] go down there and deliver them but i'm
[33:58] going to give you the words
[34:02] see moses was inefficient in himself to
[34:05] do it but god
[34:06] called him and told him listen i'm going
[34:08] to give you the signs
[34:09] and i'm going to give you aaron to be
[34:11] your mouthpiece that you're going to
[34:12] speak
[34:13] and aaron will speak for you and
[34:16] everything that you have need of no
[34:18] matter what
[34:18] all you got to do is trust in me
[34:22] and so when when and everything that
[34:24] they had to do all they had to do
[34:26] was follow exactly what moses told them
[34:28] to do
[34:29] when they when it came to the day as as
[34:32] the passover came
[34:33] when they when they got ready to leave
[34:35] you know they had to take the lamb they
[34:36] had to roast it with fire the whole
[34:38] thing had to be roasted together had to
[34:40] eat unleavened bread they had to have
[34:41] their shoes they had to have their staff
[34:43] everything had to be done they had to
[34:44] slay the lamb put the blood on the
[34:46] doorpost and on the lintel and they had
[34:48] to get ready to go
[34:50] but you know what moses told them
[34:51] everything that they had to do they
[34:53] didn't have to think for themselves
[34:54] just follow the word that's all i had to
[34:57] do
[34:59] and when they got out you know and as
[35:00] soon as as soon as i got out of egypt
[35:02] the first thing they had to do was
[35:03] complain
[35:08] they had they got their mind on
[35:09] everything else except for what the
[35:11] prophet told them
[35:15] they didn't believe
[35:20] and you know they were so here it is it
[35:22] says he says
[35:25] now that he said yes sir i can hear
[35:27] moses say now the children is a run up
[35:28] and say
[35:29] we are going to what are we going to do
[35:33] for bread now we ain't got any bread
[35:35] god will take care of that he said long
[35:38] as you come out step on the promise god
[35:40] will take care
[35:41] of the rest of it well how are we going
[35:43] to eat
[35:45] god will take care of that well we're
[35:47] just a little bit hungry
[35:50] you need a little fasting
[35:54] late down that night went to sleep when
[35:56] he got up the next morning there was
[35:57] manna
[35:58] all over the ground bread laying
[35:59] everywhere that's the way god does it
[36:02] see so they went out picked it up
[36:05] said it tasted like i said oh my this
[36:08] tastes just like honey
[36:10] he said oh my that bread never ceased to
[36:12] fall as long as they was in the journey
[36:16] every night there was a new supply you
[36:18] could just
[36:19] gather enough there to last one day the
[36:21] next day you had to come gather new
[36:25] what a type of the holy ghost in our
[36:27] journey
[36:28] them in the natural when he come out and
[36:30] separate from the world separate from
[36:32] the world
[36:33] god supplies our good times he supplies
[36:35] our bread he supplies everything that we
[36:37] have need of amen
[36:39] he told them in the natural he would do
[36:40] it he would do it
[36:42] he will do it for us in the spiritual
[36:46] and it goes on he talks about how the
[36:48] bread they could only gather
[36:50] each night they could only gather the
[36:51] bread for that day because i had to go
[36:53] out and gather more he said it would get
[36:55] wiggle tails and it would rot because
[36:58] they couldn't hold anything
[36:59] over they had to gather new because you
[37:02] know there was it was a new gathering it
[37:04] was a new
[37:05] feasting every single day and so you
[37:08] know he says and so when he goes on he's
[37:10] talking about pentecost having having
[37:12] wiggle tales in and everything
[37:13] he says when he goes he says your
[37:15] experience are getting old
[37:17] something you had 20 20 years ago what
[37:19] are you
[37:20] right now what does it mean now he said
[37:22] i'm not yelling at you
[37:24] but i feel good look that's right
[37:27] he said you've got to get a new baptism
[37:30] every day every day every day
[37:34] just keep going every day
[37:38] no no any limit to it
[37:42] you try to say well now look a month ago
[37:44] i had a wonderful experience
[37:46] he said that testimony don't work what
[37:49] about it now right now
[37:51] a new one right now god reigned it
[37:54] every night so when it comes
[37:58] see it's a it's a happening every single
[38:00] day we've got to go and gather the manna
[38:02] that god which is the holy ghost so
[38:04] you've got to feed on the word
[38:06] every single day and god has something
[38:08] for you every single day
[38:10] and you know they had to go out and i
[38:11] had to gather that that manna every
[38:13] single day
[38:16] and you know and his and his blessings
[38:18] are new every day
[38:19] every morning he has something for you
[38:22] and you know the thing is is
[38:23] we don't make time for him because if we
[38:26] don't make time for him then you know
[38:27] what we miss out on god's blessings we
[38:29] miss out on what god has for us
[38:31] because we get so tied up with all the
[38:33] other things in the world
[38:34] and they're more important you know all
[38:36] these things that are going to pass away
[38:37] all this cannon fodder and all these
[38:39] other things that people
[38:40] want to struggle and strive over when we
[38:42] forget to
[38:43] put god first when he said seek ye first
[38:47] the kingdom of god and his righteousness
[38:50] and all these other things will be added
[38:51] unto you
[38:54] he said when the holy ghost come on the
[38:56] day of pentecost they had to wait 10
[38:58] days that's right for it to come
[39:01] but never had to wait from then on when
[39:04] the heart was ready
[39:05] the holy ghost was there
[39:08] he said how long will it be we'll find
[39:11] out he said now moses
[39:13] said to aaron you go out
[39:16] and get several almers full of this and
[39:19] bring it in and put it behind the holies
[39:21] of holies
[39:22] now it won't spoil back there and then
[39:25] all
[39:25] down through the generations and every
[39:27] time that a man when he was
[39:29] was in the priesthood he had a right to
[39:31] come into the priesthood to come in
[39:34] behind
[39:34] by the holy the holy place and get a
[39:37] mouthful of that manna he'd taste it
[39:39] now what is this this is just like our
[39:41] fathers received when they started a
[39:43] journey
[39:44] uh-huh that tastes good that's good
[39:46] taste it
[39:48] every priest coming in could go back
[39:50] there in these omers and get a handful
[39:52] of it
[39:52] and get them a great big mouthful and
[39:54] he'd chew it oh how good
[39:56] it was what a privileged character he
[39:58] was to eat some of the original manna
[40:02] and that's a that's exactly the type of
[40:04] the holy ghost
[40:05] when the church started its journey 2
[40:07] 000 years ago
[40:08] on our journey to the millennium
[40:10] hallelujah god promised he'd supply our
[40:12] needs
[40:13] and the first time when they come over
[40:16] and receive the holy ghost the power of
[40:17] god began to fall upon them
[40:19] they lost all their bashfulness and all
[40:21] their shamefulness they ran out in the
[40:22] streets and began to dance in the spirit
[40:24] and carry on
[40:28] and he said then on the day of pentecost
[40:30] and they were all staggering around
[40:32] the mantle was falling down out of
[40:35] heaven
[40:35] our manna all right they said how long
[40:39] is this going to last brother peter said
[40:41] it's for you and for your children to
[40:43] them that's a far off even as many as
[40:45] the lord our god shall call
[40:48] god shall call shall have glory to god
[40:52] brother every man or woman that comes
[40:54] into this divine
[40:56] holy ghost priesthood has a right to get
[40:58] a genuine heartful of the original
[41:01] baptism of the holy ghost that fell on
[41:03] the day of pentecost
[41:04] the same signs the same power the same
[41:06] demonstration
[41:07] the same feeling the same action
[41:10] glory not something like like it
[41:14] the original right you know
[41:17] not just some cheap imitation but the
[41:20] original
[41:21] the lord said i'm going to store up a
[41:23] whole lot of this because
[41:25] there's going to be many generations so
[41:27] every time one comes in
[41:28] i'm going to give him a great big heart
[41:30] full of it
[41:32] amen i'm so glad i can say i'm one of
[41:34] them yes sir look
[41:35] peter just lost all his dignity and
[41:37] everything jumped up on a soapbox and
[41:39] began to preach
[41:40] my soapbox preacher yes sir what was it
[41:42] he had the holy ghost he was eating
[41:44] on that godly manna and today it's the
[41:47] same
[41:48] thing we're in the journey in the
[41:49] spiritual just like the journey was in
[41:51] the natural and it fell for them
[41:53] every time they wanted it fail it falls
[41:55] for us the same way
[41:57] god's got a whole big heaven full of it
[41:59] that's right it's for you and to your
[42:00] children
[42:01] them that's owensburg kentucky that's
[42:03] where he was at preaching and as many as
[42:04] the lord
[42:05] our god our god shall call
[42:08] it's for every one of them many as wants
[42:11] it god's got it for
[42:12] them many here on their journey i want
[42:15] you to see another thing
[42:16] it tastes like honey is that right
[42:20] honey the poet said i believe david said
[42:22] it tastes like honey in the rock
[42:24] and he said every tastes like and say
[42:27] the lord is good
[42:27] it tastes like honey in the rock did you
[42:29] ever taste it i seen old baptized holy
[42:32] ghost things just sitting
[42:33] so paralyzed by the power of god they
[42:35] couldn't move they just go
[42:37] [Music]
[42:38] just god blessing their souls and they
[42:40] couldn't do nothing else
[42:42] licking their lips say amen
[42:45] and then he goes on talking about david
[42:47] being the shepherd and putting
[42:49] the honey on the rock and they begin to
[42:51] lick on the rock
[42:52] and they've eaten that honey because
[42:53] that's what was so good was the honey
[42:55] was so good because
[42:57] you know they all they wanted to eat was
[42:58] the honey because the honey was good but
[43:00] the thing is is when they put it on the
[43:01] rock what they
[43:02] what they were needing was in the honey
[43:04] but they wanted to eat the honey because
[43:05] the honey was good
[43:08] but this is for you and for them that
[43:12] are far off even as many as the lord our
[43:14] god shall call
[43:15] and then when they had this manna the
[43:17] manna falls just like it was back then
[43:20] they had they had the manna that fell
[43:21] for them every single day
[43:23] and they had to go out there and get it
[43:25] but you know what there was a time
[43:27] when they went out there and and when
[43:29] they when the manna started to fall
[43:31] moses told aaron god told moses to go
[43:33] out there and get it
[43:34] and set it up in a special place it was
[43:36] going to be in the holy of holies
[43:38] and for them to store it up and he said
[43:40] every time the man
[43:42] would come into the priesthood he could
[43:43] go in there and eat that same original
[43:45] manna
[43:46] now it rotted every single day then they
[43:48] had to go out there and they had to
[43:49] gather it
[43:50] they had to go and pick it up every day
[43:52] and you know then it rotted but they had
[43:54] to go out there and every single day
[43:55] but there was a time when there was a
[43:57] place for a man to go to
[43:58] and that he could always have the the
[44:02] manna brother ram said that that would
[44:04] you know in the time if they didn't
[44:05] gather enough during the day you know
[44:07] they run out
[44:08] they got hungry till the next time manna
[44:09] fell
[44:11] but you know he said now there's a place
[44:12] he said you can come day night whenever
[44:14] time you want to
[44:15] there's a place that you can come to and
[44:16] gather in and take a part of this
[44:19] manna that god has stored up and you can
[44:22] imagine
[44:23] this this man that had entered into the
[44:25] priesthood and what
[44:26] what a great thing it was you know
[44:28] because here here's this man
[44:30] you know our forefathers ate manna in
[44:32] the wilderness god rained bread down
[44:34] they tasted like honey and it was so
[44:36] marvelous that every single day we could
[44:38] go out there and pick up this
[44:39] this bread and it was right there and
[44:42] all we had to do was pick it up and
[44:43] gather and eat it
[44:44] and you know it was so great and you
[44:45] know you know well we
[44:47] heard all these stories but you know
[44:48] there come a time when he was able to go
[44:50] in there and you know he could walk
[44:52] behind that veil and he could actually
[44:53] partake of that
[44:55] of that manna and it was the same thing
[44:56] not just not just reading about
[44:58] something or hearing about something but
[45:00] he had the
[45:01] opportunity to experience the same thing
[45:03] that they did to go behind the veil
[45:05] and taste that heavenly manner that
[45:07] wasn't just just words on a page
[45:10] or it just wasn't somebody's ideas just
[45:12] something that somebody tried to paint
[45:13] but it was an opportunity for him to
[45:15] experience
[45:16] that and it's the same thing as he said
[45:18] we received it
[45:19] the same thing on our journey but we
[45:21] have as being made
[45:23] kings and priests that we have the
[45:25] opportunity to go behind the veil
[45:27] that we can go behind the veil and eat
[45:29] of the manna we don't you know because
[45:30] you know
[45:31] the veil the veil was was there and you
[45:33] know
[45:34] aaron and the and the high priest could
[45:36] only go in there at a certain time of
[45:38] year when they brought in the
[45:39] in the blood and went in and you know
[45:40] then brett brown said that he could go
[45:42] in and he could partake of that manna
[45:44] that was before the the ark and when he
[45:46] walked into this kind of glory there he
[45:48] was he was able to partake of it
[45:50] but in our day you know when jesus came
[45:53] he was he was the
[45:54] the offering that was made that the the
[45:58] the veil was rent and when the veil was
[46:01] ran in two
[46:02] then then he said he said then the
[46:04] access was made that you and i can go in
[46:06] at any time
[46:07] day or night and walk into the holy of
[46:10] play
[46:11] and the scripture tells us now he said
[46:13] he said you know it's not that we have
[46:15] to worry about being
[46:16] being so correct as as the old testament
[46:19] you know they were so worried but he
[46:20] said come boldly before the throne of
[46:22] grace
[46:22] so you know there's a way that's been
[46:24] made that you can come boldly before it
[46:27] that you can go in there and you know
[46:29] what there is all of the manna that you
[46:31] could eat
[46:31] he said the heavens was full of it
[46:35] and he said you know they put those
[46:36] armors of the manna in
[46:38] in the before the ark and you know he
[46:42] said no matter how much they ate it
[46:43] didn't disappear
[46:46] they could eat all they could do all
[46:47] they wanted to and you know what they
[46:49] were still more when they got when they
[46:50] got done
[46:55] just like us no matter how much you
[46:59] experience of god no matter how much you
[47:01] get into god you know there's more than
[47:03] more than you have you can continue just
[47:06] to eat and grow
[47:07] and and man and just and just feast on
[47:09] it and you know what there's more
[47:10] that god has for you
[47:15] and you know it produces the same it
[47:18] produces the exact same thing
[47:23] as it did as he said because as it was
[47:26] on the day of pentecost
[47:29] on the day of pentecost he said when
[47:30] that heavenly manna when peter went out
[47:32] there and preached the message
[47:34] he said it's unto you and to your
[47:36] children of them that's a far
[47:37] off even as many as the lord our god
[47:39] shall call and so if
[47:41] whatever wherever they went whoever god
[47:43] called you know they had they had the
[47:44] right just the same right as everybody
[47:46] else to it
[47:47] and they could have it they could feast
[47:49] on it and they could have all that they
[47:51] wanted and he said it would produce
[47:53] the exact same thing the life that that
[47:56] he lived he said the things that i do
[47:58] shall you do also
[48:00] so he if he done it then it would
[48:02] produce the exact same thing
[48:05] to eat on the to eat on the word to and
[48:08] and it's available to you to eat and
[48:10] it'll manifest it'll do the exact same
[48:12] thing
[48:13] so you know if if it was the same way if
[48:16] god doesn't change it and he's made the
[48:18] same offer to everyone
[48:19] that you have the same access to it and
[48:22] if you eat on the same word
[48:24] and you feast on the same word and you
[48:26] have the same experience
[48:28] and it's the same holy ghost that they
[48:30] had that was back there and he said
[48:32] they lost all their shamefulness he said
[48:33] they lost all their bashfulness
[48:35] all these things you know they became
[48:36] bold well you know the thing is
[48:38] you don't have to stand around and
[48:40] wonder if god's going to do anything for
[48:42] you
[48:43] you know because many times people you
[48:45] know it's so amazing people want to get
[48:46] up and and then you know we talk about
[48:48] praying for people and they won't they
[48:49] want to pray and they say well you know
[48:51] i'm praying over this and i'm praying
[48:52] over there well you know that's a great
[48:53] thing to do because you know
[48:54] you can't pray enough but you know the
[48:57] thing is is realize you know
[48:58] you know if god started you on this
[49:00] journey people are trying you know
[49:02] and i don't i don't want to discount
[49:04] anything i don't want to discourage
[49:05] anybody but i want you to understand
[49:07] you know you can pray through and
[49:09] everybody you know they're going to pray
[49:10] through they're going to pray through
[49:11] but there's comes a time you know you
[49:13] pray through and you
[49:13] hand it over to god well then you know
[49:15] what you don't go out in the ground
[49:17] at this time and keep digging all the
[49:19] seed up
[49:21] you know if you have a you know wage
[49:22] plant in the garden and everything you
[49:23] know you just don't go out there
[49:24] planting one day and keep digging it up
[49:26] well let's see what happens
[49:27] no you're leaving alone well if you're
[49:30] going to give it if you're going to turn
[49:31] your cares over to god then quit trying
[49:33] to carry them
[49:35] let god do it but you know the thing is
[49:37] i'm not discounting
[49:39] praying but the thing is when we pray
[49:41] then you know what prayer
[49:43] requires one thing there's one thing
[49:46] about praying you know the thing is
[49:48] there's you can't worry about it you
[49:51] can't have faith
[49:52] and worry you can't pray over something
[49:54] and then
[49:55] and trying to figure it out right what
[49:58] do you just pray over and give it to god
[49:59] and say well lord i'm going to turn it
[50:01] over to you and then you know what i
[50:02] don't worry about it anymore
[50:03] you know i'm not trying to figure figure
[50:05] it out you know because many times the
[50:06] devil wants to get in our minds and he's
[50:08] like well how's this going to work and
[50:09] how's that going to work
[50:10] and this and that and you know what it's
[50:11] like listen god has it
[50:13] i'm not toting this thing anymore
[50:17] you know he said come unto me all the
[50:18] you that labor and are heavy laden
[50:21] and i'll give you rest and he said you
[50:24] know he said come and learn of me
[50:27] he said for my yoke is easy my burden is
[50:29] light
[50:31] so you know the thing is many times we
[50:33] get burdened down with things and the
[50:35] thing
[50:35] and things of life bother us and they
[50:37] get in our way and everything like that
[50:39] but you know what he wants us to know
[50:40] that you know if we give it to him
[50:43] he said he said are y'all his yoke is
[50:46] easy and his burden is light
[50:48] well let me tell you something brothers
[50:49] and sisters you know what if we ever got
[50:51] the burden
[50:52] of him then why are we carrying all the
[50:54] burdens of ourselves why are we carrying
[50:56] our burdens when he said if we would
[50:57] just give them to him he's got a burden
[50:59] for us to carry
[51:01] you know you know people get so worried
[51:03] they get so wrapped up in living a
[51:04] christian life and all these things well
[51:06] you know what if we could just
[51:07] rest on him then you know what he's
[51:09] going to carry us all the way
[51:11] then there's a there's a place that we
[51:12] can rest in him but you know he said he
[51:14] said the burden was light
[51:17] well then how in the world if you've got
[51:19] if you've got this light burden from him
[51:22] and people people you know they get so
[51:24] bound down by things of the world
[51:25] and you know just living a life i mean
[51:28] day-to-day
[51:29] turmoil and everything like that and
[51:31] people get so wrapped up in these things
[51:32] and then they say well i don't know if
[51:33] i'm gonna be able to make it from one
[51:35] day to the next and it's like you know
[51:36] i'm just ready to give up you know i'm
[51:38] just trying to find a place
[51:39] you know i just i just want to quit i
[51:41] just want to quit i don't know what else
[51:42] to do well you know the thing is is the
[51:44] problem is is you've not taken it to the
[51:46] master
[51:46] you've not taken it to him and laid it
[51:48] down and just give it to him say listen
[51:50] i'm not carrying this anymore lord you
[51:52] said that i could lay this all on you
[51:54] that you and you would carry this well
[51:57] you know
[51:57] sometimes when we get to the point where
[51:58] we get sick and tired of being sick and
[52:00] tired of dealing with these things and
[52:01] we come to the place where we can lay
[52:03] our burdens down
[52:04] and you know many people they've gotten
[52:06] into the place even even in a christian
[52:08] experience
[52:08] where people just want to try to live
[52:10] the christian life their self
[52:11] and they think they're going to be good
[52:13] enough and they think they can they're
[52:14] going to be holy enough and they think
[52:15] they're going to be righteous says
[52:16] enough but you know what there's nothing
[52:18] in you that's going to amount to
[52:19] anything
[52:20] because everything that you have is
[52:22] filthy rags
[52:24] you're not going to have anything but
[52:25] you know the thing is is when we get
[52:27] to a place that we can come and we can
[52:29] we can go before the lord and we can
[52:30] tell him
[52:31] lord i realize i'm nothing in you
[52:33] without you lord i know that i'm i'm
[52:35] dirty and i'm lost and i'm undone
[52:37] then you know i can turn it over to him
[52:39] then you know what then he can make you
[52:40] a new creature a new creation in christ
[52:43] jesus
[52:43] but you know until that happens you're
[52:44] not ever going to change
[52:47] you know there's many people they want
[52:48] to be religious but you know what
[52:49] religious don't get you anywhere
[52:52] holy your holy self holy don't get
[52:53] anywhere self righteous don't get you
[52:55] anywhere but there's a place that we
[52:57] come
[52:57] that you know i'm not i don't have my
[52:59] own righteousness i have his
[53:01] righteousness
[53:02] he who knew no sin became sin for me
[53:07] that i can become his righteousness
[53:10] i can become the righteousness of god
[53:13] so then you know what it's not me the
[53:16] thing is
[53:16] you know what i need to put myself under
[53:19] the blood every day
[53:20] there's a dying out every single day
[53:22] because you know the biggest problem
[53:23] that aaron roberts has is aaron roberts
[53:27] i know other people may think it's me
[53:29] but it's not it's me
[53:32] i stand in my own way i don't worry
[53:34] about everybody else getting in my way i
[53:36] get my own way
[53:40] and you know we do the same thing we get
[53:42] in our own way but you know there's a
[53:43] place that we can come to
[53:44] that we can unload all these things and
[53:47] we can we can go to god
[53:49] and allow him to be lord and savior of
[53:52] our lives
[53:59] you know to be a lord for him to be lord
[54:01] then he's he's the one that's in control
[54:03] he's the one that's calling the shots
[54:05] he's the one that's leading the way
[54:11] but you know the thing is we don't if we
[54:12] don't if we don't keep our eyes
[54:14] on what god has called us then you know
[54:17] then we all get everything all mixed up
[54:19] everything is all messed up
[54:22] you know when the children of israel
[54:24] when when god called him out there and
[54:26] told him he said i've got a land flowing
[54:28] with milk and honey
[54:30] i've got a place to carry you to
[54:34] when they come out when they come out of
[54:36] egypt and you know here they are
[54:38] they didn't they didn't own anything why
[54:41] because the egyptians owned it all
[54:43] right they didn't even own their own
[54:44] sales
[54:47] their children that they had were slaves
[54:50] and they could do anything they wanted
[54:52] to with them amen
[54:55] and you and you look at all the bondage
[54:56] that they had to face down there
[54:58] and they didn't have anything right but
[55:01] you know what they had a promise from
[55:02] god
[55:03] that who they were they were the
[55:07] children of abraham
[55:09] and god had made a promise to abraham
[55:11] and all of his seed
[55:13] but you know what they sat down there in
[55:15] bondage because
[55:16] they allowed themselves to get wrapped
[55:19] up in a place
[55:20] that they didn't belong but you know
[55:22] what when it come time for them to come
[55:23] out
[55:24] then you know what they had to cry and
[55:26] they had to
[55:27] bleed and beg and plead with for a
[55:29] savior and when the lord
[55:30] sent him then you know what then they
[55:32] wanted to fight moses
[55:35] they got out there you know their shoes
[55:37] never wore out
[55:40] they never got sick nothing nothing
[55:42] nothing was against them
[55:44] they had god had an answer for them all
[55:46] the way
[55:48] and then when he give them this heavenly
[55:50] manner you know nobody else had this
[55:52] but here when they received this manna
[55:54] when it failed you know what they got to
[55:56] the place where it become common to them
[55:58] it become common to them and they stood
[56:00] up there and told moses
[56:01] we loathe this light bread
[56:05] when god is blessing them and giving
[56:07] them miracles
[56:08] and showing all these things and then
[56:10] they say well we don't like this
[56:15] we don't like this we're not happy
[56:21] but you know here it was god was trying
[56:22] to lead them all the way through
[56:25] giving them showing them
[56:30] you know they they they was not happy
[56:32] they they
[56:33] they didn't have faith to believe what
[56:34] god was doing for them
[56:36] they were not god was not pleased with
[56:38] them
[56:40] you know here they are out there well
[56:42] you know egypt don't look so bad now
[56:48] when egypt got out of sight and they
[56:50] seemed to forget
[56:52] all the problems that they had in in
[56:54] egypt all the things that they had to
[56:55] face in egypt
[56:59] you know many people they you know they
[57:02] they want to
[57:04] they want they want to get so close to
[57:06] god
[57:08] that they're not con you know they're
[57:10] not under condemnation
[57:12] but they still want to get close enough
[57:13] to the world where you know
[57:15] they still they they you know it still
[57:17] feels good
[57:19] and you know there's there's things in
[57:21] their lives that they don't want they
[57:22] don't want to give up
[57:23] but you know they want to live close
[57:25] enough to this where you know
[57:27] they still they still have that that
[57:29] that longing for
[57:30] for the things of the world and they
[57:32] still lean this way long enough but you
[57:33] know they want to get
[57:34] close over here where you know it gets
[57:36] it gets uh you know well sometimes
[57:38] sometimes when brother wade preaches he
[57:40] he just steps on my toes and
[57:41] you know he's real hard on me and you
[57:43] know things he says and it just really
[57:44] oh
[57:45] i you know you know and i just want to
[57:47] get out for money that condemnation so
[57:48] i'm just going to get
[57:50] over here far enough but then i'm going
[57:52] back over here yeah
[57:54] and then when he starts brodel's gonna
[57:56] say something i'm gonna ease back over
[57:58] here
[57:59] yeah and then
[58:02] and you know it's so much easier to go
[58:04] this direction
[58:06] than this trying to go this way gotta
[58:09] overcome all it
[58:11] that that flash is hard to deal with
[58:13] sometimes
[58:15] you on a slippery slope because you know
[58:22] what there comes a time
[58:26] you know we need to get past all of that
[58:29] you know because you know the hour is
[58:31] late and we don't know when things
[58:32] we need to make sure that we're right
[58:37] we need to be exactly where we need to
[58:38] be we need to have every you know
[58:40] because
[58:41] you don't nobody's promised tomorrow
[58:44] we don't we don't know what's going to
[58:46] take place none of us are promised
[58:47] tomorrow we don't know what's going to
[58:48] take place
[58:50] but you know we always have to be ready
[58:51] at every moment
[58:54] but you know if we if we if god has
[58:57] given all these things to us and he's
[58:58] blessed us with these things
[59:00] does it just become common to us
[59:03] is it just become just like normal
[59:05] things well you know it's just
[59:06] it's just the same thing that you know
[59:08] wade's going to get up here and he's
[59:10] going to preach the same thing brother
[59:11] dale's going to get up here and preach
[59:12] the same thing we're going to hear this
[59:13] same thing
[59:14] brother boyd's going to get up here and
[59:15] he's going to sing the same songs and
[59:16] you know brother dawn's going to get up
[59:18] here and he's going to read the same
[59:19] scripture on sunday morning responsive
[59:21] reading or whatever
[59:22] you know it's just like well we're just
[59:23] going to do the same thing we just do
[59:24] the same thing we're just going to go
[59:25] through the motions
[59:27] well the problem is if we're just going
[59:28] through the motions are you looking for
[59:30] god
[59:31] do you see god in any of that or he's
[59:32] just like well we're just we're just
[59:34] here
[59:34] just
[59:40] i mean any dead fish can float
[59:42] downstream but you know take something
[59:44] with some fight to it to fight up
[59:46] upstream to fight the waters
[59:50] you know i mean and i i'm guilty just
[59:53] like everybody
[59:53] else you know you know somebody said you
[59:57] want to get anointed preaching just
[59:58] preach on yourself well
[1:00:00] you know sometimes that's what you do
[1:00:01] you just preach on yourself but
[1:00:05] you know you know sometimes you know
[1:00:07] because you know i don't have to have
[1:00:08] somebody get up
[1:00:09] and and look at me i look in the mirror
[1:00:11] every day i know i know who i am i don't
[1:00:14] fool myself
[1:00:17] you know you think you and if we if we
[1:00:19] think we you know well
[1:00:20] you know i think i'm okay i think i'm a
[1:00:23] pretty good guy
[1:00:27] you know i think i think i'm doing okay
[1:00:30] well you know what if you if you look in
[1:00:32] the mirror and you see see things within
[1:00:34] you
[1:00:34] you need to look in the scripture we
[1:00:36] need to look in god's mirror
[1:00:38] we need we need to look in and see and
[1:00:40] see ourselves and not try to
[1:00:41] not try to coat things over you know we
[1:00:44] need to actually look and see
[1:00:45] i i don't need somebody to tell me these
[1:00:47] things i i you know because i
[1:00:49] you know if if you if you're honest with
[1:00:51] god god's honest with you
[1:00:55] you know you're not god doesn't god
[1:00:56] doesn't fool you
[1:01:02] it's like you're okay it's okay
[1:01:05] it's okay
[1:01:08] i don't know if y'all know god does that
[1:01:11] for y'all y'all let me know i ain't
[1:01:13] never had that happen
[1:01:17] i mean you know because you know
[1:01:18] sometimes god just brings one word to
[1:01:20] you and then you realize you know
[1:01:22] i i didn't i you know that's that's
[1:01:24] something for me to straighten out
[1:01:25] you know you know
[1:01:28] you know and and sometimes god sends
[1:01:30] people your way and they just
[1:01:33] absolutely
[1:01:36] with no shadow it out they're there they
[1:01:38] just it's like a cheese grater on your
[1:01:40] nerves just like
[1:01:41] that
[1:01:44] and you know and lots of times people
[1:01:46] you know they're just like you know what
[1:01:53] i wasn't who i was i gave him a piece of
[1:01:55] my mind
[1:01:57] and it's like well brother and sister
[1:01:58] y'all might need to hold on to that
[1:02:00] piece of mind you got because you don't
[1:02:01] know how much you got to go around
[1:02:07] but you know sometimes sometimes we and
[1:02:09] what the problem is is sometimes these
[1:02:10] things happen
[1:02:11] and you know what we don't we don't take
[1:02:13] a step back and say you know what
[1:02:14] that was for me god sent somebody my way
[1:02:21] and they'll go and god's going to see
[1:02:22] how i'm going to react to it
[1:02:27] and sometimes like well will bless god
[1:02:28] go talk to me like that
[1:02:31] and sometimes you know you know
[1:02:32] sometimes it's it's
[1:02:34] it's so much it's it's so much easier
[1:02:37] just to
[1:02:38] just blow up and just get all angry
[1:02:40] instead of just
[1:02:42] take a step back take a deep breath
[1:02:45] and think lord are you you know any even
[1:02:48] though it
[1:02:49] you know just it hurts your feelings it
[1:02:50] steps on your toes sometimes it makes
[1:02:52] you angry sometimes it makes you sad
[1:02:54] i mean something you know and it's like
[1:02:55] lord you know what can i get out of this
[1:03:00] maybe that maybe the presentation wasn't
[1:03:02] the best
[1:03:03] but you know what's it the truth
[1:03:07] and you know and sometimes people you
[1:03:08] know we don't realize
[1:03:10] but you know sometimes somebody may say
[1:03:11] something that's harsh to us
[1:03:13] and you know they're not they're not
[1:03:15] meaning to be harsh
[1:03:18] and you know and sometimes you know you
[1:03:20] can you can get offended by it and you
[1:03:21] know and and you'll carry that for the
[1:03:23] longest time
[1:03:24] where you're just offended by what
[1:03:26] somebody said and you and you don't even
[1:03:28] realize that god's trying to speak to
[1:03:30] you
[1:03:30] you're more you're more interested in
[1:03:32] licking your wounds and having a pity
[1:03:34] party than you are saying you know
[1:03:36] that is for that is something for me
[1:03:37] that i can actually take
[1:03:39] and then i can actually benefit from
[1:03:42] that
[1:03:44] know and you know because you know you
[1:03:45] know many times
[1:03:47] i i feel like and maybe maybe i'm wrong
[1:03:50] but
[1:03:50] i just i just want to say this you know
[1:03:52] because sometimes i feel like that that
[1:03:54] people
[1:03:55] have they when brother like for instance
[1:03:58] brother wade that's what i want to get
[1:03:59] to
[1:03:59] is i'm talking preach on brother waiting
[1:04:01] up anyway uh
[1:04:03] you know what what brother but don't
[1:04:05] worry the way he gets up and he says you
[1:04:06] know
[1:04:07] everybody sleeps in church and it's like
[1:04:09] people don't care that they that they
[1:04:11] would just automatically go to sleep
[1:04:12] nobody seems like they want to
[1:04:14] fight it and you know i don't i don't
[1:04:17] mean to step on anybody's toes but i'm
[1:04:18] you know
[1:04:19] you know i'm i'm guilty just like
[1:04:20] everybody else
[1:04:22] i'm human and you know what i just you
[1:04:24] know and and so i can get offended by it
[1:04:28] and you know sometimes it's it's like
[1:04:29] you know the thing is is what are you
[1:04:31] going to do about it
[1:04:33] you can you can take and say well you
[1:04:35] know just like you like i was saying
[1:04:36] you can take that as a situation where
[1:04:38] you know i can just get upset
[1:04:40] about it and i can i can sit and i can
[1:04:42] just i can just hold that and let it
[1:04:44] fester
[1:04:46] or then i can just take that and say you
[1:04:48] know what that was something for me
[1:04:49] and you know what and and you know then
[1:04:51] i can say listen you know
[1:04:52] because i try not to sleep in church you
[1:04:54] know and sometimes i have close my eyes
[1:04:56] and different things but you know the
[1:04:57] thing is is you know are you
[1:04:58] you know i'm not you know like pulling
[1:05:00] out a pillow or a blanket or anything
[1:05:02] you know but
[1:05:03] you know i mean there's sometimes people
[1:05:04] just like you know they just want to
[1:05:12] but you know i mean but when those type
[1:05:14] things happen
[1:05:15] do you try to do anything about it
[1:05:21] and you know and and i i i just feel
[1:05:24] this way because you know
[1:05:26] because you know sometimes when things
[1:05:27] like like that happen when when somebody
[1:05:29] says things so you
[1:05:30] you know it's time to take it take a
[1:05:32] step back and look and say you know
[1:05:34] well lord help me with this
[1:05:38] you know and and you know and some
[1:05:39] people may say well you know they may
[1:05:41] think well
[1:05:41] you know well you're not trying to do
[1:05:43] anything well you know
[1:05:45] i it may not look like i'm trying but
[1:05:47] you know the thing is
[1:05:48] you know i i you know you said well i
[1:05:50] prayed about you know i'm trying to i'm
[1:05:51] trying to do better
[1:05:52] i'm trying you know and you know you
[1:05:53] you've got to take that and you've got
[1:05:55] to you've got to move forward with that
[1:05:57] and you've got to put that in the hands
[1:05:58] of god and try to do something about it
[1:06:02] and you know it's just like you know
[1:06:04] there's so many times that and
[1:06:05] petty things that take place and and you
[1:06:07] know brother dale will say
[1:06:08] you know here's here's these little
[1:06:10] things that people try to do and
[1:06:12] you know brother dale i don't know how
[1:06:13] many times he talked about people
[1:06:14] slamming the doors and slamming the
[1:06:16] doors and slamming the doors and you
[1:06:17] know and and you know and and brother
[1:06:19] dale would say you know listen when
[1:06:21] people are praying
[1:06:23] let's keep the noise down let's not talk
[1:06:25] so loud
[1:06:26] you know let's not slam doors and you
[1:06:28] know what and and some people
[1:06:30] it it they didn't you know they'd i mean
[1:06:32] do whatever
[1:06:33] they could you could put automatic door
[1:06:35] closures on there that
[1:06:36] they would just ease the doors closed
[1:06:38] and they were gonna slam the door
[1:06:39] somehow they'd find one
[1:06:40] and it was just like you know it's just
[1:06:41] like it's something that's inside people
[1:06:46] but you know and you know i mean this is
[1:06:48] like off the
[1:06:50] off the subject a little bit but you
[1:06:51] know you know it it's it's things like
[1:06:53] that that you know
[1:06:55] are we trying to to go with god
[1:07:01] are we allowing things to stand in our
[1:07:03] way are we are
[1:07:05] we're being you know we a hindrance to
[1:07:06] somebody else because when we come to
[1:07:08] church
[1:07:08] and we allow these things to take place
[1:07:10] you know are we trying to help somebody
[1:07:12] are we trying to hinder somebody
[1:07:15] and you know the thing is if we if we
[1:07:19] could just
[1:07:20] get into christ
[1:07:23] you know and you know that's what that's
[1:07:25] what the word is for
[1:07:29] you know it's just like when you know
[1:07:30] when john took that book and you know he
[1:07:32] ate the book in
[1:07:33] revelation 10 you know it was sweet in
[1:07:35] his mouth but it was bitter in his belly
[1:07:38] you know the word is good but you know
[1:07:39] what sometimes the word is hard
[1:07:42] the word is cutting.
[1:07:46] and many times we allow things to take
[1:07:47] place you know
[1:07:49] that we don't you know and sometimes it
[1:07:52] takes somebody
[1:07:54] it takes a preacher it takes somebody it
[1:07:56] takes your mom and dad it takes somebody
[1:07:58] to point things out to you and you know
[1:08:01] sometimes well you know he got me that
[1:08:03] he got me today he got me today
[1:08:05] and then you know what and no and it's
[1:08:06] not and it's like what lord
[1:08:09] do i you know if that's me then lord let
[1:08:11] me
[1:08:12] let me straighten this up
[1:08:16] and then and you know don't think about
[1:08:17] it anymore the rest of the time until
[1:08:20] church time
[1:08:21] and then you know it's like oh yeah i
[1:08:22] forgot about that
[1:08:26] and you know and sometimes you know it
[1:08:27] takes it takes you know a mental note
[1:08:29] even if you actually have to write the
[1:08:31] note yourself right physically write a
[1:08:33] note
[1:08:36] and you write it down and sometimes you
[1:08:39] know
[1:08:39] it takes it it takes the you know
[1:08:41] because sometimes you won't you won't
[1:08:43] think things but you know
[1:08:44] if we get in the word and if we read the
[1:08:47] word
[1:08:48] and we study on the word and it's not
[1:08:51] and it's not and it's not
[1:08:52] learning you know different you know all
[1:08:54] these different things but you know the
[1:08:55] thing is as we begin to see ourselves in
[1:08:58] here
[1:08:59] then we can begin to see where we fall
[1:09:02] we begin to see where we're
[1:09:04] failing and if we get in the word and
[1:09:07] you know we begin to eat
[1:09:08] old man it's so good well you know what
[1:09:10] sometimes it ain't too good
[1:09:12] but you know what as you begin to eat
[1:09:14] that words you know because you know
[1:09:16] how many how many have have went through
[1:09:18] a battle went through a trial went
[1:09:19] through a struggle
[1:09:21] and you know it was you didn't think he
[1:09:22] was ever going to make it through
[1:09:25] you struggled with something whatever it
[1:09:27] was and you and you battled and you
[1:09:29] battled and you battled and
[1:09:31] how many people you cried and you prayed
[1:09:34] and you know you know you just done
[1:09:36] everything you could
[1:09:39] i mean you were seeking god for
[1:09:40] something even if it was the baptism of
[1:09:42] the holy ghost or whatever it is was in
[1:09:44] your life
[1:09:44] that you battled this thing and you kept
[1:09:46] battling and he kept battling well then
[1:09:48] later alone
[1:09:48] you know you got god brought you through
[1:09:50] you overcome something
[1:09:52] and then you look back at that and
[1:09:53] you're like man that was so great
[1:09:57] you know we don't we don't enjoy the
[1:09:58] journey going through it but sometimes
[1:10:00] when god points us back to that
[1:10:02] and you think man that was so great well
[1:10:04] you know that's the way it is
[1:10:05] you get in the word and god will show
[1:10:07] you and then it's so great that you know
[1:10:09] i can i can praise god for what god's
[1:10:11] brought me from
[1:10:12] i'm not what i want to be i'm not what i
[1:10:14] ought to be but thank god i'm not what i
[1:10:16] used to be
[1:10:17] because i can point back to what i was
[1:10:19] and i can see the rope
[1:10:20] and i can see what god has delivered me
[1:10:22] from and what god has brought me to
[1:10:24] and then you know i can stand there and
[1:10:25] say oh this is so great this is just
[1:10:27] like honey in the rock to me
[1:10:29] because i can see where god's brought me
[1:10:31] from i can see what
[1:10:32] what the old aaron roberts used to be
[1:10:34] and that old aaron roberts is dead
[1:10:37] and you know and i'm still continuing to
[1:10:39] grow i still got battles i still got
[1:10:40] thoughts and failures but you know what
[1:10:42] i'm still overcoming every day i'm still
[1:10:45] overcoming every day there's still a
[1:10:46] greater thing that's coming and you know
[1:10:48] we can begin to feed on that
[1:10:50] and we begin to see those things where
[1:10:51] then all of a sudden we see the growth
[1:10:53] taking place
[1:10:54] we you know as we go through these
[1:10:56] battles and whatever comes our way then
[1:10:57] you know what
[1:10:58] god is leading us god is showing us
[1:11:00] there's grace for us to overcome well
[1:11:02] you know the thing is
[1:11:03] if the grace is only there if you want
[1:11:05] it the grace is only there for you to
[1:11:08] overcome if you want it but the thing is
[1:11:10] is you've got to have the desire
[1:11:11] and you've got to come to him because
[1:11:13] he's going to carry you the way but you
[1:11:15] know what you've got to receive it
[1:11:20] and if and so is it you know is it just
[1:11:23] something that's become
[1:11:24] common to us are we just we're just
[1:11:26] going through the motions
[1:11:27] or is there something that we say hey i
[1:11:29] really call it a spiritual vision
[1:11:31] that i see where i need to be because
[1:11:33] you know what the thing is is we don't
[1:11:35] have much longer
[1:11:36] and you know what i want to be exactly
[1:11:37] where god has called me to be
[1:11:39] i want to be on the front lines i don't
[1:11:41] want to be on the in the back somewhere
[1:11:42] i want to be fighting the good fight i
[1:11:44] want to be right where god wants me to
[1:11:46] be
[1:11:46] i want to be on fire i don't want to be
[1:11:48] cold i don't want to be lukewarm but i
[1:11:50] want to be on fire for god
[1:11:51] doing his will i want to be found when
[1:11:53] he comes doing his will i want to be
[1:11:56] called a good and faithful servant why
[1:11:58] because i've stood in the post of duty
[1:12:00] and do the done the things that god
[1:12:01] wanted me to do i don't want to be
[1:12:03] caught in the wrong place
[1:12:10] the thing is is god's got to bring you
[1:12:12] to the place that you you've got to get
[1:12:14] to the place where god wants you to be
[1:12:21] you know god's got a place for you to be
[1:12:25] and that's where you need to be
[1:12:31] and i was thinking
[1:12:35] you know just as one of my favorite
[1:12:37] stories in the scripture
[1:12:39] it's about food also i know y'all
[1:12:43] i got plenty i got plenty the bible's
[1:12:45] full of it's just it's all about eating
[1:12:47] good good good but you know one of my
[1:12:50] one of my favorite scriptures
[1:12:52] in the scripture and is in first kings
[1:12:55] where elijah
[1:12:57] you know god sent elijah out and he told
[1:13:00] ahab them he said it's not going to rain
[1:13:04] until i call for it
[1:13:06] he said there won't even be due right
[1:13:09] but you know god called him to the
[1:13:13] brookette sheriff
[1:13:15] and set him down there and you know it
[1:13:18] was just
[1:13:18] him and the ravens
[1:13:22] by that brook and the ravens fed him
[1:13:26] and he sat there beside that brook
[1:13:30] you know god had a place for his prophet
[1:13:32] to be
[1:13:33] to feed but you know what was so amazing
[1:13:37] during that time
[1:13:38] he's sitting there alone with god and
[1:13:40] you know what was going on during that
[1:13:41] time
[1:13:44] the scripture tells us brother brown
[1:13:45] talks about it you know
[1:13:48] there was a there was a widow woman
[1:13:51] and you know she was out there and she
[1:13:53] was going through the last bit of her
[1:13:54] meal
[1:13:56] in the last bit of her oil and there was
[1:13:59] the prophet over there next to that
[1:14:00] brook
[1:14:01] and he was resting relaxing getting fed
[1:14:06] and just relaxing and enjoying the
[1:14:09] presence of the lord
[1:14:12] and the scripture tells us he said i've
[1:14:14] prepared a web at a woman
[1:14:17] that she's going to feed you
[1:14:21] he's like well you know what he's doing
[1:14:23] pretty good sitting beside the brook
[1:14:24] there with the ravens feeding him i
[1:14:26] don't know why he needs
[1:14:27] why he needs that woman that little
[1:14:30] woman is over there worried
[1:14:32] and struggling
[1:14:36] and seeing her son being malnourished
[1:14:40] and looks out there every single day
[1:14:44] and sees that famine and seeing
[1:14:47] everything dry up
[1:14:51] and you know she couldn't see anything
[1:14:53] good in all of that
[1:14:56] you know what god already had a way made
[1:14:57] for her
[1:15:00] and the prophet said over there and
[1:15:03] supernatural
[1:15:04] feasting and that woman sitting there
[1:15:07] and and all of that time when the brook
[1:15:10] dried up you know
[1:15:11] after he had been through all of that
[1:15:12] then he come over to that widow woman
[1:15:16] and she got down to her very last bit
[1:15:22] and got down to where she had nothing
[1:15:28] and he went to her and and he said bring
[1:15:30] me something to drink
[1:15:33] in a famine
[1:15:36] and he said oh wait bring me a little
[1:15:38] cake
[1:15:41] can you bring me something to eat
[1:15:44] in the midst of a famine
[1:15:50] he said can you bring me
[1:15:55] i mean a stranger
[1:15:59] the scripture never tells us she knows
[1:16:01] she knew who he was
[1:16:07] but we'll give will you give
[1:16:10] of all that you have oh yeah
[1:16:13] facing life and death
[1:16:21] and she said we've got two little sticks
[1:16:24] here
[1:16:25] and she said we're getting ready to make
[1:16:27] these little cakes
[1:16:28] for me and my son and we're gonna die
[1:16:33] and he said go do what you're going to
[1:16:34] do but he said make me a little cake
[1:16:36] first
[1:16:42] and you think about that
[1:16:45] you know when when you've got nothing
[1:16:46] left
[1:16:48] and then she said i'm i'm gonna make
[1:16:50] this a little cake and give you
[1:16:52] water in the midst of this famine
[1:16:56] in this condition that we're in
[1:17:01] and when she decided that she was going
[1:17:03] to give
[1:17:04] of her necessity it wasn't it wasn't it
[1:17:08] wasn't of her abundance
[1:17:11] it's when she had nothing else to give
[1:17:14] she gave all that she had to give
[1:17:17] but she gave to him first and
[1:17:20] when she done that the prophet told her
[1:17:25] said listen for the rest of the time of
[1:17:27] this famine
[1:17:28] said you'll never run out of meal you'll
[1:17:31] never run out of oil
[1:17:35] and you know she made that little cake
[1:17:37] and gave him that little bit of water
[1:17:39] out of her necessity out of her want
[1:17:43] she gave to him but then god come on the
[1:17:46] scene and blessed her
[1:17:49] and he was getting she and so you know
[1:17:51] here he was on the
[1:17:53] the prophet on the backside getting this
[1:17:55] supernatural
[1:17:56] feeding but you know what she
[1:18:00] and herself somehow she knew the lord
[1:18:02] spoke to her whatever
[1:18:04] but she gave of her of her of what she
[1:18:07] had
[1:18:09] when she gave all that she had
[1:18:12] you know when jesus speaks to the of the
[1:18:14] widow woman given the might you know
[1:18:16] and they said well you know what why why
[1:18:18] he's you know listen listen listen
[1:18:20] everybody has to give
[1:18:24] you know and he said she'll be honored
[1:18:26] for giving out of her lack
[1:18:30] you know even even when brother brown
[1:18:31] talked about sister hattie wright given
[1:18:33] putting money toward the church
[1:18:35] and you know he was going to give her
[1:18:36] money back to her but yet and
[1:18:39] and that you know god told him you know
[1:18:41] don't do that
[1:18:43] don't take away sister hattie's blessing
[1:18:46] she sowed that
[1:18:49] when you look i mean they was poor as
[1:18:52] poor can be
[1:18:54] but she wanted to but she wanted to
[1:18:55] serve god
[1:18:57] and she gave out of her lack she gave to
[1:19:01] him
[1:19:01] she gave to the church and then when
[1:19:05] brother branham came to her
[1:19:06] he began to speak to her about the
[1:19:08] things that about the squirrels and the
[1:19:09] different things you know and he began
[1:19:11] to speak and that's when sister had he
[1:19:12] said you know that's nothing but the
[1:19:13] truth brother brent
[1:19:15] when she began to speak then god turned
[1:19:17] around and said give her what she asked
[1:19:19] for
[1:19:21] and when so when when we give we give
[1:19:24] out of the abundance but the thing is is
[1:19:26] do we give our all
[1:19:28] right you know many times people can
[1:19:29] give other talents
[1:19:32] well you know it's it's not a struggle
[1:19:34] for some people to do things but do we
[1:19:36] give our all
[1:19:37] right is it is it out of your out of
[1:19:40] all that you have do you give of that
[1:19:44] when we when we give all to god god god
[1:19:46] don't want 99
[1:19:48] and a half him on 99 and nine tens
[1:19:51] he wants all do we give our all to him
[1:19:55] because if we won't if we give our all
[1:19:57] to him then you know what
[1:19:58] he said he said because there is a
[1:20:02] blessing in that
[1:20:05] if you're going to feed on the word of
[1:20:06] god you're going to feed on the things
[1:20:08] of god
[1:20:08] then you know what you have to give up
[1:20:12] have we given our all to god because he
[1:20:13] gave his all for us
[1:20:15] is our all as the song says is our all
[1:20:18] on the altar tonight
[1:20:19] have you give we can we can feed on god
[1:20:21] has a lot for us but you know
[1:20:24] as as i believe it was uh
[1:20:27] moody i believe it was he said god never
[1:20:29] turns us away empty
[1:20:31] unless we're full of ourselves
[1:20:34] if we've not emptied ourselves out then
[1:20:37] you know what god can only do
[1:20:38] so much but do we empty all ourselves
[1:20:42] out
[1:20:42] because we want to receive from what god
[1:20:45] has for us
[1:20:47] let's let's feed on this manna that god
[1:20:48] has given us amen
[1:20:51] let's let's not let's not look at it as
[1:20:53] this light bread
[1:20:54] let's let's not look at it as just
[1:20:55] something common but let's feed on this
[1:21:00] let's feed on this word let's give us
[1:21:01] lay every side of every weight
[1:21:03] and everything that's easily besets us
[1:21:06] and let's run this race and let's feed
[1:21:08] on this word
[1:21:09] let's let's let's do all let's be found
[1:21:11] in what god wants us to do
[1:21:13] you know and i i want to share one other
[1:21:16] thing before i close and
[1:21:18] you know you know when the when the
[1:21:20] syrophoenician woman was there
[1:21:22] and you know she come to jesus and she
[1:21:24] had a need
[1:21:26] the syrophoenician woman come and you
[1:21:28] know she called him son of david and he
[1:21:30] and he didn't answer he
[1:21:31] you know she was a dog he didn't have he
[1:21:32] didn't have nothing to do with her but
[1:21:34] when she said lord he realized that
[1:21:36] he was her lord you know she had a she
[1:21:39] had a child that needed needed a touch
[1:21:41] and
[1:21:42] and and he was like you know i don't i
[1:21:43] don't we don't give it we don't give our
[1:21:44] bread to the dogs
[1:21:45] you know we're not one and he and she
[1:21:47] said true lord
[1:21:50] he said but the dog seeks of the crumbs
[1:21:54] they'll fall from the master's table and
[1:21:57] you know what you're so much better than
[1:21:59] that
[1:22:00] you don't have to eat crumbs
[1:22:03] there's no crumbs at god's table for you
[1:22:06] there's more than you can eat because
[1:22:09] you know the more you
[1:22:10] the more you desire the more he gives
[1:22:13] hey what he has has more
[1:22:14] and he desires to give you more than you
[1:22:16] than you could ever
[1:22:18] think because he said you know if we
[1:22:21] would open up
[1:22:22] you know that he would open up the
[1:22:23] windows of heaven and if we would just
[1:22:25] try him
[1:22:26] amen and everybody's like well you know

[1:22:44] in this but you know the thing is is
[1:22:46] do we do we step back and say what is it
[1:22:49] that god would have us do
[1:22:51] you know what there's time to read the
[1:22:52] bible there's time to pray
[1:22:54] but you know there's time to sit down
[1:22:55] and pray for each other
[1:22:58] and you know you know what you know
[1:23:03] some of the best things that's happened
[1:23:05] to me in my life is when somebody's
