========================================

all right here we go we're live good morning good morning hi good morning Bob brother teacher Bob preacher Bob all right let's turn to Matthew Chapter 5 we're um continuing on with the merciful and the pure in heart and um talk louder yeah I'm to talk loud so everybody can hear me thank you he said he'll try to talk loud the Elder the Elder if you're going to sit back there and be all comfortable and lean up against the thing and be all comfortable you going have to talk loud we need a little amplifier this microphone on Monica can hear him okay yeah as long as Monica can he all right blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain Mercy blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God so we left off I want to kind of remember last time we were talking about how these can be grouped in two to help to better understand so today I'm kind of going to group merciful and pure in heart together and read a scripture from Exodus that really ill illustrates um how this is made manifest in us and um but take a step back I put this picture up here this is one of the new pictures from the Hubble telescope of this new spiral galaxy that they took way out in space and U this is just one of thousands of galaxies and each galaxy has millions of stars so think about before the Earth the foundation of the world when the logos went out and out of him came the word to create the universe the worlds everything each each one of these Stars might have you know 10 or so planets spinning around them and uh and then that same one that spoke these worlds into existence when he went up the mountain and spoke these Beatitudes that same word spoke these blessings to us to be made manifest in us and he promised there's a promise that my word will not return to me void that means that everything that I say it will accomplish the purpose that it will set forth to do and when the word went out from him in the beginning it did exactly what it was meant to do which was to form the worlds into existence and these blessings that we're reading about how blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted all of these words that went out from Christ will be made manifest in us and such a wonderful promise that we have that his word will not return to him void it will accomplish exactly what he said he said it with would do so blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy and we kind of talked before about how you really can't show Mercy unless God has unless you have seen Mercy in your life and then after the New Birth then God begins to deal with you based on your your actions how you treat others he'll show you uh he'll he'll treat you as as you treat others if you uh are um showing forth Christ God will show his Mercy to you but Salvation is not based on works right so I wanted to talk about what Mercy is not and this is a this is a papus that uh I guess you say Papyrus not Papyrus this is this is a Papyrus from the ancient Egyptian Book of the Dead and what they believe beli uh the way they believed um was that the son God raw would uh every day it would go through it cycle of of of uh birth in the morning it would be born the son God R will be born and go through an aging process in the evening will go Beyond the Horizon and at after it would go down under the Horizon it would go into the what's depicted here is the underworld and when when when raw went into the underworld he would uh battle with the serpent every night he would do battle with with a serpent and be resurrected the next morning as the sun in the sky that that the Egyptians would look up and see and uh so they believe that when you died if if you had enough wealth for people to build you a nice enough grave for people to bring you food because they believe that food was and things like that were essential for your your journey into afterlife then possibly POS L you would get to meet um I'm drawing a blank at what these God's names are right now but uh you would go through a uh the book of the deal was kind of a uh how to go through the perils and and trials in the afterlife and once you went through c a few certain trials then You' come to this scale where they would take your heart and this is a uh according to the commentators and so forth this is a scribe whose heart is being weighed on the scale based on his good works that's how a lot of people interpret Mercy the blessed are the merciful for they shall receive Mercy as if you're merciful to other people in your life then God will save you yeah but that's uh that's kind of like what the Egyptians believe that they believe that through your life if you did bad Works your heart would get heavier and if you did good works your heart would get lighter so on the other end of the scale they would weigh your heart against the ostrich feather of the god M that was the god of Truth and Justice and they would balance that out how would you like to have your heart weight against the feather based on your good works not not by own righteousness but uh by his righteousness the only way that will so that's if if their heart weighed lighter than the ostrich Fe then they could proceed to the god of irus and enter into uh their their version of paradise but I just wanted to I thought that Illustrated good pretty good what um well they have nothing else to go by right they didn't have a Bible they didn't have anything right and they just look up at the stars and and see didn't really understand let's go to Exodus 12 and read about the past service remember we're thinking about mercy and being pure in heart together 12 1 uh yes 121 no 12:14 sorry sorry 12 12 you got to be more you got to be more consistent now remember when uh the first first thing that Moses told Pharaoh when he went down into Egypt was Israel is my firstborn the word from the Lord was Israel is my first born give me my firstborn let them go and worship or I will take your first born so verse 12 I'm I'm thinking through a lot of thoughts um Israel God had given Israel a leader in Moses and then they gave they gave signs and wonders evidence that God was among them they saw all the signs and wonders they saw the uh The Hil storm turned The Hil turned into fire and the water turned into the blood and the frogs and the Locust and the lice and all of the many things that God had done but none of those things would let them go free the only way that they could go free was when a PRI the price had been paid and applied over the door and uh it didn't matter whether you were Israelite or Egyptian when the when the uh the death angel came through the land right and the Death Angel was God it's not like the um that Ten Commandments movie where it makes it seem like it's some evil that all through the scripture God said I I will come I will come it wasn't um some spooky something like in that movie where some Mist I I I kind of disagree with that um so uh it didn't matter whether you were Israelite or Egyptian if you didn't have that blood applied over the door of your heart or over over your door then then uh the death angel would not pass so let's look at um I'm trying to okay let's start at verse 12 for I will pass through the land of Egypt this night and will Smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt both man and Beast and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment I am the Lord and the blood blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where you are and when I see the blood I will pass over you and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when I smite the land of Egypt and this day shall be unto you for a memorial and you shall keep it a feast to the Lord throughout your Generations you shall keep it a feast by an ordinance forever seven days shall you eat unleavened bread even the first day you shall put away leaven out of your houses for whosoever eateth leaven bread from the first day until the seventh day that sh Soul shall be cut off from Israel and and that's what I mean about tying mercy and Purity together they took they put away all the leavon out of their house and to this day the Jews still have during the Passover they will do a little thing where they uh they they make the little uh cakes they put like dough throughout their house they hide it call Mah M thank you m I knew you were looking for that M I bought some one time you can buy it in the store y real thin cracker like thing with stripes they just don't know about the stri strip stand for that's good the body of Jesus cuz it's got stripes in it's got holes in it yeah that's good I'm I'm never go to the store and ask one they got you know look public probably has it in the ethnic section yeah coer stuff but M so they uh that's good they'll put it in their house I didn't have to put it in my house already in my house right right they'll put it in their house to get rid of it first and go then go search it out and to commemorate this event of getting rid of the leav over seven days CU down through the seven Church ages right each uh during each each age you had to believe your word for that day your your word for that the word for Luther's day was justification if you were in Luther's day and believe well I'm save because uh my heart is lighter than an O Str so to speak then that wouldn't do it seven days shall you eat unleavened bread even the first day you shall put away leavon out of your houses for whosoever eateth leaven bread from the first day until the seventh day that Soul shall be cut off from Israel now it's talking about being pure in heart being pure and in the first day there shall be an holy convocation and in the seventh day there shall be an holy convocation do you know manner of work shall be done in them save that which every man must eat that only May that only may be done of you first and last after first and the seventh of the same very good and ye shall observe the Feast of unleaving bread for in this selfs same day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt therefore shall ye observe this day in your Generations by an ordinance forever in the first month on the 14th day of the month that even he shall eat un 11 bread until the 1 and 20th day of the month at even right seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses for whosoever eateth that which is leaven even that Soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel whether he be a stranger or born in the land he shall eat nothing Leen in all your habitation shall ye eat unleavened bread then Moses called for all the Elders of Israel and said unto them draw out and take you a lamb according to your families and kill the Passover and you shall take a bunch of hisp and dip it in the blood that is in the Basin and strike the lenen and the two side post with the blood that is in the Basin and none of you shall go out at the door of his house until the morning for the Lord will pass through the Smite the Egyptians and when he seeth the blood upon the lenen and on the two side posts the Lord will pass over the door and will not suffer the Destroyer to come in unto your houses to Smite you and you shall observe this thing for an ordinance forever so God passed over them and gave them a remembrance something to remember that Day by uh to remember to always every year to celebrate the Passover and that's what they were doing last time we talked about the Ethiopia he came to Jerusalem to celebrate the Passover and he went through all these ordinances but he didn't have this the the mercy and the pureness of heart and these things we're talking about that only comes from the new birth and then uh numbers 3:13 after God redeemed you you're his you're not yours anymore at numbers 3:13 because all the firstborn are mine remember he went down he said Moses down to get the firstborn for on the day that I smed all the firstborn in the land of Egypt I hallowed unto me all the firstborn in Israel both man and Beast mine shall they be I am the Lord I like how he repeats it twice all the firstborn of mine mine shall they be and ends with I am the Lord once your you're saved you're not yours anymore you're God's amen now in Joshua the second chapter 18-9 the two spies that went to Rahab they remembered all of these remember all all of the ones that didn't believed and didn't go into cadis barnea they died off in the wilderness and what was left they were uh I just love reading through that story of how by the time they crossed the river Jordan they were walking in Step perfectly perfect harmony with God's word and they walked across and they were all believers till uh when they lost the battle because aen took the uh uh what he wasn't supposed to yeah um it was such a horrible thing to just lose a few people in that in that battle that they all went to prayer and I I think that's how we should be just if we don't get healed if we things don't go right we should all get on our knees and seek God just like they did that everything any everything would be uncovered that we live pure lives so these two spies that went over to Rahab they remembered that if you're under a covenant if you're under an atonement then you will be delivered so they told they they told reabold when we come into the land Thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou that has led us down by and thou shalt bring thy father and thy mother and thy brother and all thy father's household home unto thee and it shall be that whosoever shall go out of the door of thy house into the street his blood shall be upon his head and we will be Guiltless and whosoever shall be with thee in the house his blood shall be on our head if any hand if any hand be upon him and uh see how Mercy is withholding judgment and if you reject Mercy judgment Falls because what is with hell uh comes upon you so that's why they're saying if anyone if Mercy is shown you got the Scarlet thread hanging out from the window and then you you come out from under that covering then the only thing left for you is judgment and even though she was on the walls of the city the most D seem like the most dangerous place to be uh you know why are we so worried about who's going to be the next president and everything right I just throw that out there now what about Christ when he was dying on the cross real Mercy comes from something God gives you then Jesus father forgive them for they know not what they do while he was dying on the cross they had killed him uh and taking his life and uh I had a conversation with Zach on the way home last night about how he he was only on the cross for three hours so he it said he gave up the ghost they didn't they didn't take it from him he gave it up he was in total control over the whole situation that's right and they parted his arment and cast lots and then Luke 23:46 and when Jesus had cried with a loud voice he said father into thy hands I commend my spirit and having said th he gave up the ghost so now when that same life comes into came into the church they they heard what Steven said and they they took him out and stone him just like Jesus said if they hate me what are they going to do to you and they stoned Steven calling upon God and saying Lord Jesus receive my spirit the same thing that Jesus said on the cross and he KNE down and cry with a loud voice Lord lay not this sin to their charge and when he had said this he fell asleep because the light the same life that was in Christ is now in him it makes you act different blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God that's what we're going to talk about next now you can say well the Pharisees the Pharisees had the life cuz you could you couldn't hold a candle to their life but they didn't have what I'm talking about now they didn't there's no way they could talk about Mercy they they took that woman they found in adultery and threw at Jesus feet and said kill her that's a different that's a diff that's not the same life that was in Steven that said father forgive Lord forgive them and the Pharisees Jesus said but woe unto you scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites for ye shut up the Kingdom of Heaven against men for ye neither go in yourselves neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in so they the Pharisees looked okay on the outside by all everything on the outside they were doing they were uh going to church doing everything exactly right but there's something lacking on the inside if you take a look at the inside like Jesus said there they they were like white wash simpers they were they were painted on the outside but on the inside dead men's bones woe unto you scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites for ye paay tith and mint and anise and cumin and have omitted the weigher matters of the law they were so worried about in their in their little uh uh spice cabinet how much tithe they pay of of their little spices but they weren't worrying about judgment mercy and Faith what we're talking about now these you to have done and not to leave the other undone remember I read a quote a couple of weeks ago about brother BR said you you uh you desire God and you come to the Altar and you pray and you say God help me but then you won't actually do what God's word requires you'll uh uh uh it it's more than just being spiritual it's uh do what do what God's word asks you to do right right Matthew 23:25 26 Lo un you scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites for you make cing the outside of the cup and the platter but within they are full of extortion and excess Thou blind F he cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter that the outside of them may be clean also so now we're talking about Pharisees let's slide it up to this day and talk about the five foolish vergins remember uh the Bible Jesus told the parable of the of the 10 virgins and a virgin is Pure Living a a pure life now you could say that the Pharisees were living a pure life but there was something that was a different kind of Purity than than what comes by the new birth in you that's right and you can look at the the all the the 10 versions and say well everybody is living a pure life but five of them had the power of God in their life and the other five uh maybe one day when they realized the Rapture had come or when they when they will realize the Rapture had come realize that oh wait you mean I've got to have a revelation too you mean I've got to it's important for the statute of a perfect man uh to be made manifest in my life you mean that uh I've got to love my brother as myself you mean I got to have virtue and knowledge Temperance meekness all these things instead of just going to church and putting on an outward show and uh and Israel and the church go around and said watch the 10 vergins that went out five all of them virgins five of them were foolish five had oil in their lamps what is the oil the Holy Spirit see that's right they were all virgins live good clean lives you say well brother I don't go to dances I don't go to shows that's just the moral things unless there has been a supernatural not because you shouted not because you spoke with tongues not because you jumped up and down not because you did this but something supernatural has happened in here that's changed you and put a seal put you a sealed love in God your anchor that's right why you don't believe I believe in shouting I believe in all these things but that isn't the answer it's something more than just doing like a Pharisees and being a a good person and the 10 virgins in the 144,000 he said now watch these two churches oh if I could if there was some way I could just make the people see it just burns in my soul these churches are just as clean and holy as this one if they're all virgins they're all virgins just as clean the only difference was the oil and the lamp the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost if it's in there it produces the very same kind of fire it did on Pentecost but they don't have no fire no oil in their lamp they have church ritual church just as ritual as it can be fine ceremonies PR that would shake your conscience and songs like angels singing and there you'll put your finger on your their life you couldn't do it but still that's wrong it's not it's part of it but not all of it that's the kind that misses the Rapture see Paul telling Timothy his letter to Timothy now the end of the Commandment the end of the Commandment sum it all up right is Charity charity is love the Holy Ghost I have a pure heart and the definition of pure is there a nothing else but one thing and you can say what pure gold is nothing else but gold pure uh silver nothing else but silver pure heart is nothing there but what's supposed to be there and through your through your journey uh uh God purges You by his holy ghost fire and removes all of the impurities out of a good conscience and of faith uname not not faking it like the Pharisees just because they out outly lived right and uh outside they were painted white from which some have having swerved have turned aside un vain jangling Desiring to be teachers of the law understanding neither what they say nor where of that affirm and we talked before about how God you can't understand God's word unless you've got the Holy Ghost in 1 Peter 1: 12223 seeing you have purifi purified your souls and obeying the truth of the spirit unto unfeigned love of the Brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently being born again not of corruptible seed but of Incorruptible by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever now it's interesting see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently and uh I was I was studying on uh John and how you know he used to say over and over and even in Scripture that uh and it's written by arenius that a lot of times uh when he was so old he couldn't hardly move they brought him into the church at Ephesus and he could just barely squeak out little children love one another and and over time a lot of them kind of got tired of hearing that over and over they thought that we already we are we we've heard it so many times should we know it why do you keep saying that and uh it's written down by the early church fathers he said well God told us to love one another and if you do that that's enough and um I got to reading uh this is I I guess kind of a table quote because there's nothing in the Bible about this but Clement and eus wrote this story about John and uh after he was on the aisle of patmas he went back to Ephesus and when he got back to Ephesus only a few months before Timothy had died in in January of that that previous year and they wanted him to John to take over the uh pastorship of that church so um he he uh one of his first things was he he started traveling around to make sure that all of the churches in that area had were set up with good pastors and that they were agreeing with the word and that everything was okay so he went to one of the churches and he found a young man that he he commended to the bishop over that area and he said you need to take special care of this man and help him through his journey and so the man said I I the brother said I absolutely I'll take good care of him I you commended me into my care and uh he baptized him and made sure he was on his on his road and John went back to Ephesus and later on that man got into the wrong crowd and uh started hanging around a bunch of Thieves ended up leading the bound of robbers and went up into the mountain John came back and said I put this brother in your care and you uh where is he and the man started crying and he said he's beyond all hope he's become he went into a f of robbers and there's no hope for him and John said uh just paraphrasing there's there's always hope unless he's blasphemed there's I you know I just reading this story I think that's how a lot of times maybe we act uh we think so because somebody's uh you know had troubles in their life that it's it's they're beyond all hope and uh so we we leave them and and neglect our duties like this this uh brother that John was dealing with but John he was getting close to 80 years old uh far too feeble to be making a journey up into the mountain but that's exactly what he did he went up into the mountains after this brother found him and uh he was was leading this Band of Thieves and the brother was so torn up in his heart and so uh his conscience was so guilt stricking that he he would he hid his hand behind his back his right hand because uh of all the things that he had done as a robber with that hand but John took his it's written eus and Clement wrote John took his hand and kissed it and said and L him back to the Lord that's uh purify your soul and obeying the truth see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently and uh you know I think how many times John said uh love just love one another little children and uh let's try not to grow tired of those words because we should um it's so important to that brotherly kindness is right up there under uh the top right up there it's because it's so hard it's what it's it's diff diffult and that's what's the it takes Christ to do that uh with us and in US is to really love one another and look past our faults and that's mercy and the pure in heart and uh I hadn't even got through half of my slid so right let's keep on next time let's stop right there thank
