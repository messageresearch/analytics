[33:32] ok Matthew 3
[33:38] now we'll read these together if we
[33:40] don't get there this morning we'll come
[33:42] over to this evening but let's go to
[33:46] verse 13 then cometh Jesus from Galilee
[33:50] to Jordan under John to be baptized of
[33:52] him but John forbade him saying I have
[33:56] need to be baptized of thee and cometh
[33:58] out to me and Jesus answering said unto
[34:01] Him suffer it to be so now for thus it
[34:06] becometh us to fulfill all righteousness
[34:07] then he suffered him in other words he
[34:10] baptized him you know he told him it had
[34:12] to be oh we know the sacrifice had to be
[34:14] clean so it had to be made ready and
[34:18] Jesus when he was baptized went up
[34:19] straightway out of the water and lo the
[34:22] heavens were opened unto him and he saw
[34:26] the Spirit of God descending like a dove
[34:27] and lighting upon him and lo a voice
[34:30] from heaven saying this is my beloved
[34:33] Son in whom I am well pleased
[34:37] and notice the reading in whom I am
[34:40] well-pleased are pleased to dwell now
[34:44] we'll go to Matthew 17 because that's
[34:48] the beginning of Jesus's ministry
[34:50] River Jordan will back up to that that
[34:52] was the beginning of it in in everything
[34:55] you know and then now we're coming to
[34:57] the winding down of his ministry and we
[35:01] start verse or chapter 17 and after six
[35:05] days Jesus taketh Peter James and John
[35:07] his brother and brought them up into an
[35:10] high mountain apart and was transfigured
[35:14] before them and his face did shine as
[35:16] the Sun and his raiment was white it's
[35:19] the light behold there appeared unto
[35:21] them Moses and Elijah talking with him
[35:25] around said they were actually telling
[35:27] him and talking about his second coming
[35:29] no I then answered Peter and said unto
[35:33] giant to Jesus Lord it is good for us to
[35:36] be here if thou wilt let us make here
[35:39] three Tabernacles one for thee one for
[35:41] Moses one for Elijah while he yet spake
[35:44] behold a bright cloud overshadowed them
[35:47] and behold a voice out of the clouds
[35:51] which said this is my beloved Son in
[35:54] whom I am well pleased
[35:57] same statement now of the River Jordan
[36:00] but look it's what's added to it
[36:04] hear ye him you may be seated the Lord
[36:09] at his blessing to the reading of the
[36:11] word so keep that in mind now do we get
[36:13] our thought and try to come to that
[36:16] point that we'll talk about here you him
[36:22] if we get a change they don't we'll pick
[36:23] it up this afternoon and take it on into
[36:26] the service all right so just remember
[36:28] these things remember this announcement
[36:31] the things brothers Joe wants to talk to
[36:34] each one of them and try to get a
[36:35] picture some may not be here but maybe
[36:37] we can cut it you know they're good at
[36:40] doing that maybe they slice a picture
[36:43] and put it in and you know make you to
[36:46] be standing there all right I said now
[36:49] we won't
[36:49] I don't know when how far we'll get into
[36:52] what I want you to think on but I'm
[36:56] trying my best to get you to think about
[37:01] when where we're at what's happening
[37:05] we're relieving the time that we're
[37:09] living right where we're at the you know
[37:14] I mean finding our day recognizing your
[37:17] day in this message all right we've had
[37:19] the message okay praise God for that we
[37:23] recognize that we believe it God sent us
[37:26] a prophet okay but our last message we
[37:29] dwell on it but we didn't I didn't get
[37:32] fully clear of what I want you to think
[37:34] on on what we were talking about on the
[37:39] fact that in the levites chapter of
[37:43] Hebrews and I tried to cover it the
[37:47] Levitt chapter of Hebrews covers the Old
[37:49] Testament Saints okay you can
[37:53] technically and I say that technically
[37:55] because all of it really applies to the
[37:57] Old Testament because that the thing
[38:01] that when you get down to the bottom of
[38:02] it saying that they didn't receive the
[38:05] promise
[38:05] all right so basically all of Hebrews 11
[38:10] will be applied to the Old Testament
[38:12] people and it says they without us
[38:14] should not be made perfect you know
[38:19] you said well no that was made perfect
[38:21] by Jesus Christ well for what they
[38:25] needed was made perfect by Jesus Christ
[38:27] why would it say to the Old Testament
[38:31] Saints now and we'll read where the
[38:33] Prophet said it was the Old Testament
[38:35] people you know why would it say without
[38:38] us they cannot be made perfect okay now
[38:46] why is it that the Old Testament is
[38:48] dependent upon the New Testament bride
[38:55] see then we can kind of follow the line
[38:58] of getting into the New Testament and we
[39:02] can see that throughout the New
[39:04] Testament then you would how the age is
[39:06] coming down and everything and then
[39:09] you'd stand over here in the life stage
[39:11] and see the ending up of all things and
[39:13] look back and you could say they without
[39:18] us down through the church ages cannot
[39:23] be made perfect now that does not mean
[39:26] that we're going to raise them up preach
[39:29] something to do this something to make
[39:31] them perfect that's not the point
[39:34] that word dar is complete see the Old
[39:41] Testament Saints are not made complete
[39:45] you said well all right think about it
[39:49] now there's some that come up and differ
[39:52] and there's an argument about the
[39:55] resurrections and the things and I'm
[39:56] going to get into it with anybody I'm
[39:58] just going to state it and move on into
[40:01] what we're talking about in the Old
[40:04] Testament you know you had an emptying
[40:07] of a paradise yes you had things took
[40:10] place yes you had people raised Darwin
[40:14] the Lord Jesus raised right but where
[40:17] did it go
[40:21] and be real careful there I tried to
[40:23] explain it last Sunday be real careful
[40:26] where did it go now they didn't go to
[40:31] the seventh dimension because brother
[40:35] Branham couldn't even go to the seventh
[40:37] dimension when he went beyond the
[40:38] curtain of time he wanted to see Jesus
[40:42] he wanted to he cities they said he's
[40:43] higher said you can't go higher
[40:46] all right now then we ought to get our
[40:49] little petty petty thoughts out of our
[40:51] mind about something and settle down to
[40:54] an understanding that word there where
[40:56] it says without us they cannot be made
[40:58] perfect it means that they can not be
[41:02] complete right all right now the Old
[41:07] Testament is waiting on you and I to be
[41:09] made complete the New Testament is
[41:12] waiting on you and I to be made complete
[41:16] right so what is the thing that we're
[41:19] waiting on this body to be redeemed
[41:31] salvation is already been yes the Old
[41:33] Testament Saints was waiting on Jesus
[41:35] Christ sure because the New Testament
[41:37] Saints is waiting up in Jesus Christ you
[41:39] better get it all together
[41:40] we're all waiting on Jesus Christ
[41:43] waiting on something to happen but just
[41:45] remember the point that I've tried to
[41:47] drive over and over to you on the
[41:50] adoption how that is in three stages the
[41:52] new birth brings you a child of God puts
[41:58] you in the body of Christ then you got
[42:01] the Romans eight coming down through 21
[42:04] 22 23 through there that the whole world
[42:07] is waiting for the manifestation of the
[42:09] sons of God all right but then it goes
[42:14] to 23 and it says that you're waiting to
[42:17] the adoption to wit to understand the
[42:24] art to see to follow that in to see it
[42:29] to understand it or make it known
[42:32] right and see what is the thing we're
[42:36] waiting on we're waiting on the
[42:45] redemption of the body cause that's the
[42:47] last thing your soul is redeemed by the
[42:51] new birth we've had 50 years since the
[42:55] going of the Prophet to at least heaven
[42:58] we'll see that too maybe at the end of
[43:00] the messenger this afternoon one and see
[43:02] how it ties together we've had a long
[43:04] time God has been patiently waiting on
[43:07] you and I not to get an uber that's
[43:14] already supposed to be transferred I
[43:15] mean Trent and taking place and see then
[43:21] we're in the stage in between the new
[43:23] birth and the redemption of the body and
[43:27] that's where we're at right now and
[43:29] that's why we're doing that's reason
[43:30] I've dwelled and over to make you to see
[43:34] what I'm trying to say is the the you
[43:37] know the new birth is wonderful but
[43:41] we're in a stage then but in that stage
[43:44] to where that it would come forth and
[43:47] understand to wit to understand to see
[43:51] the redemption of the body because
[43:54] that's what we're waiting on right
[43:58] you're not waiting on the new birth and
[44:01] the redemption of the body has not
[44:04] transpired right I mean if you if you
[44:11] you think it your but you have your
[44:14] glorified body and I tell you what I I'd
[44:18] hate to hang around in this now this
[44:21] thing getting older and older and older
[44:22] it's going down you may think you're
[44:24] doing good but just remember it's gonna
[44:27] catch up with you all right and see they
[44:31] then without us cannot be made perfect
[44:35] are brought to the complete stage why
[44:39] are they crying there how long how long
[44:41] we go into the fifth seal with the Jews
[44:44] right all
[44:45] those things but we're going in into it
[44:48] seen it how long how long is all the way
[44:51] down through time
[44:52] everything from Genesis the whole
[45:00] everything from Genesis to where we are
[45:05] now is dependent upon us to that new
[45:14] birth is there I will cover this
[45:16] afternoon we'll get on predestination
[45:19] because you're predestinated unto
[45:21] adoption somebody is so why can't we
[45:27] believe it then we say yeah but I just
[45:31] don't see nothing going on well maybe
[45:36] that's God's way of doing it
[45:38] I know you don't think like I think I'm
[45:43] crazy
[45:44] and I'll take one thing about it I
[45:47] believe it you say here we are we got
[45:55] this and that and the other but those
[45:56] people back yonder had more than we do
[45:58] well I wonder what would happen if you
[46:02] brought them down here to where we are
[46:04] and put us back dark I serious I mean
[46:07] you know I'm not joking or play and I'm
[46:10] telling it the way I believe it they had
[46:13] one or two doctrines to exist with
[46:16] Pharisees and Sadducees that a little
[46:18] thing called hero D ins and things like
[46:20] that little group sling off here we got
[46:24] nine hundred different denominations and
[46:29] two thousand different groups of this
[46:32] message and that's probably a low number
[46:37] right but is it true
[46:41] I'm not trying to make no light of
[46:43] nobody I'm trying to tell it like it is
[46:46] to be honest and see where we're staying
[46:49] somebody's waiting on somebody somewhere
[46:55] because the Bible's
[46:56] is it alright and if it says it I
[47:01] thought we believed it supposed to be
[47:03] made manifest see so day without us
[47:07] cannot be made complete see those Old
[47:11] Testament Saints could never come to a
[47:14] full redemption of the body if it is
[47:21] show me where they're at show me where
[47:23] they are now when nobody can approach
[47:27] into immortality but to the Lord Jesus
[47:29] Christ that's why I brought around said
[47:31] I can't go there where he's at now
[47:35] that's what he said so what this mum or
[47:41] out you want to but just remember one
[47:43] thing if it is true that the Bible is
[47:49] true then the world is waiting on
[47:54] somebody why can't we believe it's us
[48:02] well can't we accept that it's us
[48:07] because we remember all these years I
[48:09] preached to you where it said that to
[48:11] wit I've preached that for 40-something
[48:14] years to you about it to wit to
[48:16] understand the redemption of the body
[48:18] there's never been our people on the
[48:22] earth outside of sections or places
[48:25] we'll get to a decision
[48:26] you're the disciples talk about the
[48:28] coming of the Lord the redemption of the
[48:30] body the things right but then you see
[48:34] them going down but you see somebody's
[48:39] got to come to the place to understand
[48:42] and it you say what you want to go ahead
[48:47] I've tried to get you to see the thing
[48:51] we need is redemption of the body and
[48:57] with that no divine healing no
[49:00] resurrection is that what your prophet
[49:03] said
[49:04] well everything's waiting on you and I
[49:08] to do what not to come up and do some
[49:11] great miraculous thing see we think it's
[49:14] waiting on some great uprising some
[49:17] happening some great big outpouring of
[49:20] the Spirit I believe in that but I
[49:23] believe that a poor I don't everything
[49:24] cause the Bible says it will the Bible
[49:30] tells us plainly that in the last days
[49:32] he pour out his spirit upon all flesh
[49:37] I've looked for a great move right I
[49:40] believe in it always have but I know too
[49:45] that we must get into the place for that
[49:49] you said well this is supposed to happen
[49:51] that for all right if we don't get in
[49:54] the right place that can't happen how
[49:56] many times have you heard this statement
[49:59] you're gonna catch a higher plane and
[50:01] you go down to the bus depot now that's
[50:06] about the way we do right
[50:08] you're gonna go to California you're
[50:10] gonna fly there but you go down to the
[50:12] bus depot well I you ain't gonna get
[50:16] there unless you get a bus to the
[50:17] airport right see I've tried to be
[50:23] trying to dis get us to think about we
[50:27] are what the world is waiting on it's
[50:33] not waiting listen it's not waiting come
[50:36] on George it's not waiting great
[50:39] manifestations of outpourings of of this
[50:42] that and the other and great moves that
[50:44] will be among that out there I've
[50:47] preached that for 40 years to you if a
[50:51] revival is going to come to me and you
[50:52] they're going to get to after-effects of
[50:54] it they're gonna have it and you better
[50:58] think about what it said a lot of times
[51:00] that there's a lot of times there's more
[51:02] going on out there
[51:03] then it's trying to go among us maybe
[51:06] we're the ones that's missing it when
[51:08] they're waiting on us but it looks like
[51:09] we're waiting on them know
[51:16] that's somebody somebody's going to make
[51:20] that none of them and what if I tried to
[51:22] get you to see where it says the
[51:24] manifestation waiting the manifestation
[51:28] the making known the Prophet said what
[51:32] does benefit say making known all the
[51:37] signs and wonders are dead raised the
[51:39] sick healed that can be out there but
[51:44] the making known is the what what did
[51:48] the Prophet cover it when we were
[51:49] talking about adoption the other day
[51:51] where he covered it there in the message
[51:53] and said it's a mystery that's been hid
[51:56] from the foundation of the world history
[52:00] of adoption mystery of adoption because
[52:06] in adoption you go all the way to the
[52:08] change the mystery to wit to understand
[52:15] somebody's going to make know somebody's
[52:17] going to preach it we've had the message
[52:19] we're not looking for something else
[52:23] right we're not looking for another
[52:26] prophet to come along artist somebody to
[52:28] come along tell us what he said we've
[52:31] got what he said we're going to believe
[52:35] it
[52:38] see the world is waiting on somebody to
[52:41] just take the word and move into it and
[52:45] believe it yeah when I've seen them felt
[52:49] well everyone this failed means one
[52:52] thing for certain more truth is there
[52:54] than you think
[52:55] because if you can see the bad out there
[52:58] it's kind of like somebody said one time
[53:00] they're talking to somebody you know
[53:01] about brother Branham being the Prophet
[53:03] and they said well you know he was a
[53:05] false prophet and the feller tone said
[53:08] well okay we got that soft because into
[53:13] what he said you just said he was a
[53:15] prophet no I said he was a false prophet
[53:18] he said okay he's false prophet we got
[53:20] that south now where's the true one
[53:24] right what's the true one going to be
[53:29] was it to be signs and wonders through
[53:32] the profit to catch the attention of the
[53:33] bride I know it was the opening of the
[53:39] word the opening of the word is supposed
[53:44] to catch the bride's attention the
[53:47] making known of God how much how many
[53:49] times have I said this to you if we will
[53:51] make him known he'll make us know who's
[53:55] worried about healings and signs and
[53:56] wonders and things to happen if we just
[54:00] make him known how can we make him known
[54:02] Oh we'll go I can raise the dead and
[54:04] heal the sick
[54:05] that ain't the way you make God known
[54:07] you make God known by believing his word
[54:10] taking what he says and staying with
[54:12] what he says right see then why don't we
[54:19] believe we're here all right see why
[54:23] can't we follow it like that and think
[54:26] about it that they do you understand
[54:29] what I'm saying there the whole world
[54:32] will read it in a minute where bread run
[54:34] says the world is waiting the whole
[54:37] world is waiting on the manifestation of
[54:39] sons of God
[54:40] he even said to mohammedans after
[54:42] looking for it well well he said it but
[54:51] see the whole world is waiting on
[54:53] something to take place what the new
[54:57] birth has come it's here it's in your
[55:01] soul if you're born again manifestation
[55:08] of sons and daughters of God is here it
[55:10] may not be in degree that we think about
[55:12] it but it's here so what are we waiting
[55:16] on what's the one thing the world is
[55:19] waiting on what's the one thing that
[55:21] that all of those that have died and
[55:24] went on is waiting on they could not
[55:27] come to that prominent to the promise it
[55:30] says in Hebrews why they died and went
[55:35] by the grave
[55:37] they couldn't come to a change of the
[55:40] body right didn't they're waiting on
[55:45] somebody to come to that place that the
[55:48] body can be changed the rest will follow
[55:53] it I didn't bring it but I got a quote
[55:55] where brother branham said that that's
[55:57] what they we don't listen to him in his
[55:59] way to stay I think it's the future home
[56:01] not certain off on it right he said them
[56:05] Old Testament science would raise one
[56:08] day and go up and says we'll fall right
[56:13] in line well that's the Old Testament
[56:19] and we follow thee what's the problem
[56:23] that's what he said he said and we'll
[56:27] fall right in line and going out into
[56:29] rapture yeah but that's backwards no one
[56:36] ain't backwards it's right see the dead
[56:41] in Christ are going to rise first
[56:43] right then we which are alive and remain
[56:47] to be changed so they're going to raise
[56:50] and go and we'll follow right behind but
[56:56] that's only the bride well that doesn't
[56:58] matter if it takes part this way or that
[57:00] way
[57:00] but listen just think about it
[57:14] of God raises up a standard what is it
[57:17] he's pouring in his spirit then those
[57:21] who are resting out younger in the grave
[57:23] are under the altar as the scripture
[57:28] says are crying how long Lord how long
[57:31] how much longer God's waiting on me and
[57:34] you the church is waiting on me and you
[57:44] adoption time when God can pour into us
[57:48] his fullness his power his resurrection
[57:52] and when the church in Christ becomes so
[57:55] close together till Christ becomes
[57:58] visible among us and raise the dead and
[58:00] we go into rapture no there's the whole
[58:07] thing right eagle stirreth isn't it
[58:12] but God's waiting to get his church in
[58:14] order he's waiting on you and I may he
[58:21] grant the blessings waiting to get in an
[58:27] order here you him
[58:30] there's where God's trying to get his
[58:33] church just say to this mountain be
[58:35] moved and it will move Authority sons of
[58:40] God the whole creation is groaning
[58:42] waiting for the manifestation of the
[58:44] sons of God
[58:45] waiting to a spot to word that the
[58:47] sickness will be in rise and it will be
[58:50] that way the blind will receive their
[58:52] sight deaf and dumb we pray for them now
[58:57] but then your command did they listen
[59:02] didn't say these signs shall follow them
[59:04] that believe they shall pray for the
[59:08] sick didn't say that
[59:10] so they'll cast out devils not I will
[59:13] they will if you say to this mountain
[59:15] not if I say if you say to this mountain
[59:22] be moved in doubt not in your heart
[59:23] what we need is adoption sons and
[59:26] daughters needs adoption
[59:32] no Chester the Great Prince when we
[59:37] rally there with Abraham Isaac and Jacob
[59:40] Jacob those who were heirs of the
[59:44] promise looking forward to us not to
[59:48] fail they're looking forward to us not
[59:57] to fail right they're dependent on us
[1:00:06] this morning
[1:00:07] let us not fail keep your anchor in
[1:00:10] Christ glorified Jesus how that those
[1:00:18] Old Testament Saints are looking now
[1:00:21] without us they are not perfect so
[1:00:25] they're depending on us to believe God's
[1:00:27] Word they're dependent with us to
[1:00:33] believe God's Word remember what we're
[1:00:35] talking about now they without us cannot
[1:00:39] be made perfect they cannot be complete
[1:00:44] even though even brother Branham till
[1:00:47] this day is not complete no I'm told
[1:00:52] it's truck put it right right
[1:00:54] the bodies in the grave what is that
[1:01:02] true no no you thought no I'm not

[1:01:16] what
[1:01:17] what's the whole story what are we
[1:01:18] waiting on the Messiah that's why the
[1:01:25] Bible says the earth is groaning crying

[1:01:30] God the world is waiting for a man to
[1:01:33] come back into his rot estate come on
[1:01:44] come back to his right estate it is I
[1:01:51] and bring his people back to manifested
[1:01:55] sons of God like they had them in the
[1:01:58] Garden of Eden
[1:02:02] the whole world's were groaning and
[1:02:05] waiting for the hour for the
[1:02:06] manifestation of the sons of God he has
[1:02:11] no voice tonight but our voice he has no
[1:02:15] hands but our hands
[1:02:18] he has your hands and that whose hands
[1:02:23] it is there is adoption it's a mystery
[1:02:33] that's been hidden since the foundation
[1:02:35] of the world waiting for the
[1:02:38] manifestation of the sons of God of
[1:02:40] history from the foundation of the world
[1:02:48] where do we get to it if we get there
[1:02:50] this afternoon
[1:02:53] the Bible says Ephesians 1 that's your
[1:03:03] predestinated unto adoption you know
[1:03:10] what
[1:03:11] you believe God's work you believe
[1:03:15] anything he predestinate will take place
[1:03:18] if you don't you're an unbeliever the
[1:03:21] altars open you need to be up here
[1:03:24] praying to get that unbelief out right
[1:03:29] so why can't we believe it why can't we
[1:03:34] see what we're doing
[1:03:35] remember our thoughts for this message
[1:03:37] is what not to look back that's great
[1:03:40] faith builders and thinking like a
[1:03:42] straight not to look forward but to see
[1:03:48] where we're at now I probably said that
[1:03:50] was the greatest mistake that we made
[1:03:54] but not realizing what's taking place
[1:03:57] now we have but we've got so many of
[1:04:04] these that's got to be there you can be
[1:04:10] tried by have a word well I just don't
[1:04:17] understand the Bible said he would send
[1:04:19] these things among us to try to see if
[1:04:24] we'd stay with the word or go with that
[1:04:28] that's what I told you 40 or 50 years
[1:04:31] ago I said you wait'll the day come when
[1:04:33] the Methodist and Baptist is about there
[1:04:35] will be preaching and raising the dead
[1:04:37] and healing the sick and I said then you
[1:04:38] gonna run I threw it cuz you're gonna
[1:04:42] see signs and wonders and you're not
[1:04:45] going to think about the word being
[1:04:46] preached you're gonna have your signs
[1:04:47] and wonders you're gonna run eyes for
[1:04:49] those signs and wonders is it not true
[1:04:52] that as quick as brother Branham died
[1:04:55] some of those went to a certain brother
[1:04:57] to see what he was in the mess what he
[1:05:00] was doing called he had signs and
[1:05:01] wonders is that throwing disrespect now
[1:05:08] called where everybody's looking for
[1:05:10] something but it's true
[1:05:17] what about it tell me my brother tell me
[1:05:25] my sister paragraph 19 of adoption when
[1:05:29] was the time that the sons of God was
[1:05:30] ever to be manifested outside of this
[1:05:33] time now
[1:05:35] well that's been brother there I've been
[1:05:37] 50 years ago Hemi remembers what I
[1:05:40] preached the last time I said somewhere
[1:05:44] about the nineteen and forties or
[1:05:46] somewhere in there a prophet came on the
[1:05:48] scene and begin to you know you can go
[1:05:51] back to 33 you can go to where you want
[1:05:52] to that fine a prophet came on the scene
[1:05:56] and begin to preach we entered a stage
[1:06:00] there of a wonderful opportunity for
[1:06:05] Malacca for Luke seventeen thirty
[1:06:08] revelations ten seven to be made
[1:06:10] manifest right until that time it
[1:06:15] couldn't be done but then when he comes
[1:06:20] on the scene with the message why can't
[1:06:23] we just walk in that message you believe
[1:06:25] it
[1:06:28] what's the problem because what did he
[1:06:31] say
[1:06:36] something of God was ever to be
[1:06:38] manifested outside of this time now when
[1:06:41] were there ever a time in the history
[1:06:45] that the manifest the time to deliver
[1:06:49] all nature where's there ever been a
[1:06:53] time to deliver all nature it's never
[1:06:56] been delivered right so that means it's
[1:06:59] going to be delivered the first nature
[1:07:01] is going to be me and you the first
[1:07:04] thing is going to be this made right not
[1:07:08] new we're not gonna give us a new body
[1:07:10] you have a brother so-and-so said wood I
[1:07:13] don't care what he said the Prophet said
[1:07:15] we're not gonna do it my Bible says the
[1:07:20] Jesus raised with nail prints in his
[1:07:22] hands he didn't get a new body but it
[1:07:25] was glorified huh explain it now you
[1:07:29] can't do it you can
[1:07:30] it's playing glorified nail holes just
[1:07:36] get it out forget it
[1:07:40] right understand it took place I don't
[1:07:45] know
[1:07:47] manifestations time to deliver all
[1:07:49] nature nature the nature itself is
[1:07:52] groaning waiting for the time either
[1:07:54] manifestation what's the benefit station
[1:07:56] we'll get down to it to meet make it
[1:07:57] known why before the atonement was made
[1:08:04] and listen before the holy ghost was
[1:08:07] ever poured out before all the Old
[1:08:11] Testament on down through there couldn't
[1:08:15] have been manifestation it had to wait
[1:08:18] till this time once it have to wait to
[1:08:22] this time
[1:08:26] why is your prophet not covering that
[1:08:29] when Jesus Christ raised from the dead
[1:08:31] and came back into the Holy Ghost
[1:08:33] then it was manifest at that time why is
[1:08:35] he waiting til down come on that's been
[1:08:41] my whole point if your prophet is right
[1:08:49] then there's something missing all the
[1:08:53] way down through time that could not be
[1:08:56] understood because it was a mystery but
[1:08:59] it could be understood in this life days
[1:09:03] the mystery of the manifestation mystery
[1:09:11] of the sons and daughters of God in
[1:09:13] manifestation listen it had to weigh
[1:09:20] this time all things had been broke
[1:09:23] coming shaping up to a headstone to the
[1:09:25] manifestation of the sons of God coming
[1:09:27] back and the Spirit of God coming into
[1:09:30] these men so perfectly until their
[1:09:32] ministry will be so close like Christ
[1:09:34] till it would join him and his church
[1:09:37] together with earnest expectation the
[1:09:40] whole creation is waiting for the
[1:09:41] manifestation the manifestation what is
[1:09:44] the manifestation making known no it's
[1:09:49] the dead raised the sick healed that's
[1:09:51] making known God get it right but that's
[1:09:54] not where wait on them so you say well I
[1:09:57] see signs and wonders I'll know it's
[1:09:59] true you're right in the middle of the
[1:10:01] devil's trap you're in the devil's trap
[1:10:08] right sorry you're groaning waiting for
[1:10:14] the time of adoption and we believe that
[1:10:17] one of these days the Holy Spirit will
[1:10:19] move in not with a new birth for we
[1:10:23] received that through Christ but you'll
[1:10:29] adopt your church then we taught
[1:10:36] adoption in the Baptist Church but we
[1:10:40] taught it as long as we knew the new
[1:10:42] birth do you realize the Bible says that
[1:10:47] adoption is not for the Gentiles ain't
[1:10:52] no word that says it's that way but
[1:10:53] listen what I'm saying the Bible says
[1:10:55] the Dobson was for their Israel the Jews
[1:10:57] right it don't say it's for the Gentiles
[1:11:00] do you realize when you got the new
[1:11:03] birth now listen when you got the new
[1:11:08] birth you were adopted into the family
[1:11:10] of God you had no right of lineages like
[1:11:15] the Jews they would have had to come the
[1:11:18] same way because of the fall in the
[1:11:19] garden the fall in the gardens of the
[1:11:23] Jews under the same situation but they
[1:11:26] had a promise ahead of it that's why he
[1:11:28] came to them he came to his own
[1:11:34] he offered it to him they turned it down
[1:11:45] but we Gentiles accepted it and believed
[1:11:50] it thank God but he understand adoption
[1:11:56] was originally for Israel because they
[1:12:00] were the people of God if they would
[1:12:02] have been anybody gotten the new birth
[1:12:04] revela you know whatever you talking
[1:12:06] about
[1:12:06] new birth eternal life salvation
[1:12:08] whatever the Jesus country it was them
[1:12:10] but they rejected it and when they did
[1:12:17] it showed it to the Gentile so now what
[1:12:19] we get when we are born again we are
[1:12:21] adopted into the family at the new birth
[1:12:32] we tend to house adopted into the family
[1:12:37] at the new birth now there's got to be
[1:12:42] that manifestation and things that gap
[1:12:45] in between and then the lies to wit the
[1:12:47] redemption of the body are you following
[1:12:52] me
[1:12:59] manifestation making known I'm not
[1:13:06] trying to listen I know I talk when I
[1:13:10] talk you you don't get it I'm sorry this
[1:13:16] I'm just me and if you don't want me get
[1:13:20] you somebody else probably a lot of you
[1:13:24] would like that situation but that's
[1:13:26] alright go ahead and do it cuz let's get
[1:13:29] on with it
[1:13:30] let's get your rapture here but see
[1:13:38] manifestation is making known we think
[1:13:45] it's signs and wonders that's great
[1:13:46] because that is the way you're making
[1:13:48] God known Amen come on
[1:13:51] but that's not it because you can have
[1:13:53] the dead raised to sit healed and
[1:13:55] everything and it still be anointed ones
[1:13:57] now what are you doing how you gonna
[1:14:02] know the difference I can always say the
[1:14:06] Bible says that that it ascended among
[1:14:08] us a prophet coming and do this that and
[1:14:10] the other says if you don't hear them
[1:14:11] you're lost
[1:14:13] alright turn over the scripture just a
[1:14:16] little bit further and read where he
[1:14:19] says that there'd be things happening
[1:14:21] and said they'd be prophets come among
[1:14:24] you and those prophets he said what
[1:14:34] you've got to hear them right but if
[1:14:37] they take you to another God don't hear
[1:14:41] them you know what I love the rest of it
[1:14:43] I know I've talked to a lot of people
[1:14:47] about this and they just go haywire when
[1:14:49] the rest of that he said he said because
[1:14:52] I sent him among you my great army that
[1:14:57] I sent among you why to try you to see
[1:15:04] if you'll stay with the word dead race
[1:15:09] it healed take you to another God what
[1:15:11] do you do
[1:15:12] not the door right what you see where
[1:15:20] the bait is that God will do it he will
[1:15:23] allow the dead to be raised
[1:15:25] thus it healed and the great things
[1:15:26] happening and I've always told you one
[1:15:29] day that will come into a greater
[1:15:31] manifestation when God poured out his
[1:15:33] spirit on the bride to get her to the
[1:15:36] right place
[1:15:36] that's going to fall all over in the
[1:15:40] life day that my spirit upon all flesh
[1:15:42] your sons and your daughters he said who
[1:15:46] Antichrist are Satan would upon my
[1:15:50] children on my children he says what are
[1:15:56] you looking for brother Dale I'm looking
[1:15:59] for a great move of God to come among us
[1:16:01] to where the Dead is register singing
[1:16:03] Amen I'm looking for that but if I'm
[1:16:05] going to ask that fellow what he
[1:16:06] preaches
[1:16:11] you mean you go you mean to deaths gonna
[1:16:13] be raised in front of you and you gonna
[1:16:15] ask him what he preaches yeah yeah
[1:16:18] because my soul is involved in this if
[1:16:23] he if he's genuine of God he'll have no
[1:16:26] problem he'll understand why I'm asking
[1:16:28] the question so he'll try to explain it
[1:16:33] but you see where did you perfectly fall
[1:16:36] right into the traps of the devil
[1:16:38] looking for great signs and wonders to
[1:16:41] take place without the word
[1:16:51] well now then without the word now who's
[1:16:55] gotta write or the Bible says it the
[1:16:58] Prophet says if I say anything that
[1:17:00] prophet don't say you come tell me cuz
[1:17:05] come on your duty by on your duty band
[1:17:08] if I say something that come from that
[1:17:09] prophet don't say now I ain't sayin some
[1:17:11] little silly word that I said was wrong
[1:17:13] no well then I'm gonna do that anyway
[1:17:18] I'm just human but listen am I reading
[1:17:24] what he says that's why I read it to you
[1:17:28] that's why I put it on Internet where
[1:17:32] it's not what I say I haven't said a
[1:17:36] thing this morning
[1:17:37] of what I think I've read to you once
[1:17:40] your prophet said now do you believe him
[1:17:49] do you believe him see I thought then
[1:17:53] that we were supposed to believe Romans
[1:17:55] 8 of the new birth verse 14 right
[1:17:59] through there and then make you heirs
[1:18:01] and joint heirs and then 21 2021 along
[1:18:05] in that would be the manifestation of
[1:18:07] the sons and daughters of God and then
[1:18:09] verse 23 would go to we're to understand
[1:18:11] the redemption of the body you realize
[1:18:15] the Apostle Paul now I know I don't go
[1:18:19] wrong with me listen but the Apostle
[1:18:22] Paul was he basically covered the
[1:18:25] complete plan of redemption whereas
[1:18:28] maybe some of the others never put it in
[1:18:30] their writings you know what I mean
[1:18:31] Peter had the statue of a perfect man
[1:18:34] but he don't talk about adoption
[1:18:39] but Paul knew all of that Old Testament
[1:18:42] tied together and he knew what the
[1:18:45] mystery was that was waiting for the
[1:18:47] adoption to understand the manifestation
[1:18:53] of the sons of God know the whole Bible
[1:18:57] was waiting on Jesus
[1:19:00] amen for Jesus to be right hey we've got
[1:19:10] your finger.this they mean what about it
[1:19:20] you don't but brother Dale if we could
[1:19:24] just get something to make me feel good
[1:19:27] this could make me lift it up and doing
[1:19:35] the greatest lifting up I could ever
[1:19:37] think about is to find out how much I
[1:19:40] love God and to find out the world is
[1:19:46] waiting on me no now let's waiting on
[1:19:52] somebody right that's why you can't get
[1:19:55] me cuz I won't put it over onto that
[1:19:57] away you don't say waiting on me see
[1:19:59] that referee Schmidt waiting on me
[1:20:00] blessed art I've had this message we're
[1:20:02] waiting on me
[1:20:02] good let's go get all that junk out of
[1:20:04] the way it's waiting on somebody the
[1:20:11] Bible says it the Prophet says it all
[1:20:13] right why can't we believe we're that
[1:20:16] would not believe with that no I just
[1:20:23] don't see it you're alive ain't you I
[1:20:28] just don't see it I just you know what
[1:20:31] quiet I'll find it you'll find it out
[1:20:33] there go up there go to Gainesville they
[1:20:38] got a great move up there games will go
[1:20:39] up tired just sit down and listen you
[1:20:41] probably see some dead race it healed
[1:20:43] all kind of signs and wonders if that's
[1:20:45] what you're looking for but what do you
[1:20:51] say in the word what does the word say
[1:20:55] about it like I said one scripture says
[1:20:59] prophet comes gives you these signs and
[1:21:02] all you've got to believe it are you
[1:21:05] lost the other one says they come and
[1:21:08] bring these thing but take you to
[1:21:10] another guard
[1:21:10] I seen it among you to try you
[1:21:14] you mean God yes God allows the devil to
[1:21:21] bring these things among us right come
[1:21:28] on but what are we gonna do we're gonna
[1:21:35] sit around and twiddle our thumbs
[1:21:36] waiting on the bus to pull up correct
[1:21:39] what we've been doing 50 years we've
[1:21:40] been doing pretty good I've been having
[1:21:42] a wonderful time for 50 years whether
[1:21:44] you believe it or not I enjoy life I
[1:21:47] enjoy the thoughts of God to where he'll
[1:21:52] just take me and you just carry me
[1:21:54] through and I look at it and I stay with
[1:21:57] Lord I can't see that he just opens it
[1:22:02] up well thank you now I see that but now
[1:22:06] I can't see that the coach is always
[1:22:10] going to a deeper thing you ain't never
[1:22:14] caught on one thing for around here if
[1:22:16] Tom fog would here he'd tell you nary I
[1:22:19] preached the same thing over and over
[1:22:21] and over and over been at forty years
[1:22:22] cuz they but one Bible st. with one
[1:22:24] message ain't with one guard and I've
[1:22:26] been preaching the same thing for 40
[1:22:28] years but it just keeps getting higher
[1:22:30] and higher
[1:22:34] it just gets higher and higher and
[1:22:37] higher and higher and I hope that you
[1:22:40] get the idea that it's dependent on you
[1:22:43] because it ain't dependent on me all I
[1:22:47] got to do is bring the messages that's
[1:22:51] all I'm farting for me to do is to bring
[1:22:54] the message it's up to you to make it
[1:22:56] manifest
[1:23:03] what about it alright now maybe you'll
[1:23:09] get that part they without us
[1:23:15] so that means somebody's waiting on it
[1:23:19] and somebody's going to do it right
[1:23:22] because in god there's not anything that
[1:23:24] he says it's not gonna come to polish
[1:23:26] right so somebody is waiting on a change
[1:23:34] of the body right because that's the
[1:23:37] last thing you can come through the
[1:23:40] other things and pick up with it as we
[1:23:42] will this afternoon to see where it's at
[1:23:44] and we've had it scattered over 50 years
[1:23:46] where Jesus had it for three I've said
[1:23:50] that to you we'll bring it back down to
[1:23:52] that the Lord within if we can get
[1:23:53] darkness after nothing but anyhow listen
[1:23:59] they meaning somebody without us now
[1:24:08] somebody is to us
[1:24:10] I like that brother Theo Erasmus you
[1:24:13] remember him from Cape Town South Africa
[1:24:15] he preached here on God's name is not
[1:24:19] complete without us you memorize priest
[1:24:22] it J said his name is Jes Jes he said
[1:24:29] but now you put us in there and said
[1:24:31] it's Jes us so he's not complete without
[1:24:35] us your prophet you want to quote where
[1:24:39] brother Brennan said the Godhead is not
[1:24:41] complete without you well I just don't
[1:24:46] listen I don't either but I believe it I
[1:24:50] don't understand how the cow drinks
[1:24:52] these two green rice there's all these
[1:24:55] things and you swap me okay I don't
[1:24:57] understand that
[1:24:59] but I ain't gonna stop drinking meal
[1:25:04] they always try to tell us that a brown
[1:25:06] cow gets chucked at me well I never did
[1:25:08] find evidence that's all right but now
[1:25:12] listen church
[1:25:15] so they without us nowadays as they've
[1:25:18] which could mean there's got to be a
[1:25:19] group of people without us means there's
[1:25:21] got to be a group of people so now Jesus
[1:25:24] Christ is going to be made manifest in
[1:25:26] the last days through the Bride of
[1:25:28] Christ do you agree with that that's the
[1:25:31] purpose for us being here we're here to
[1:25:33] make him known we're here to manifest
[1:25:36] him are to glorify him we're here to
[1:25:40] tell the world of our Savior right you
[1:25:45] don't go out and get people now listen
[1:25:47] to the point you don't go out and get
[1:25:48] people to to getting born-again I was
[1:25:52] like I watched that in the Prophet he
[1:25:54] could preach the deepest sermon and I
[1:25:56] would be full of people nothing wrong
[1:26:00] here
[1:26:00] yeah that ain't fitting my understanding
[1:26:03] no but he he'd preach them and he could
[1:26:07] preach the deepest message and they'd
[1:26:10] come to the altar we'll see what he was
[1:26:12] doing he was contacting the person and
[1:26:15] bringing the word and then what did the
[1:26:17] prophets their ministers to do break the
[1:26:20] spell that Satan has over your eyes so
[1:26:22] brother Branham could be preaching the
[1:26:24] seals and people come in to the altar
[1:26:28] right and him dish preaching his heart
[1:26:32] out the deepest thoughts could ever be
[1:26:34] an altar coming full of people receiving
[1:26:37] the new birth why cuz he broke the spell
[1:26:43] I mean you just got priests long enough
[1:26:49] for that spell to be broke alright and
[1:26:52] you can see that spell broke over their
[1:26:54] eyes then you can see people see it and
[1:26:56] when they see it they'll believe it see
[1:27:01] that's that's all I'm trying to do is to
[1:27:05] just bring out the message to get it to
[1:27:08] work that we can look at these things
[1:27:09] and see that they're for us all right
[1:27:15] now let's take an example through the
[1:27:17] scriptures and then we'll quit all right
[1:27:21] the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:27:25] he came upon earth to read English we
[1:27:30] were I was listening yesterday thought
[1:27:31] had been set down her in the woods just
[1:27:32] this listen to one tape right after the
[1:27:35] other than one tape right after the
[1:27:36] other I just leave it plugged in my ear
[1:27:37] and this set tire I'm sitting there for
[1:27:40] hours I got nothing dudes that would
[1:27:42] look around so I just put inter taking
[1:27:44] this listen to the Prophet and you you
[1:27:47] get him to hearing him talk about you
[1:27:51] know the things that things that God
[1:27:54] wants to make himself known to you and
[1:27:58] me he wants to reveal itself to us and
[1:28:04] in doing that how does he do it and a
[1:28:08] prophet comes along like I said
[1:28:09] preachers a deep message and all that
[1:28:12] once right in the middle of that message
[1:28:13] something happens to the brain and that
[1:28:15] you go click and something starts
[1:28:20] unveiling in you that he's not even
[1:28:22] preaching about you ever done that
[1:28:24] you ever had a preacher to preach it on
[1:28:25] something in about that time you just
[1:28:27] lose him and he just keeps on talking
[1:28:28] all of the cause one because God started
[1:28:31] talking to you you ever done that it's
[1:28:34] wonderful they've never done it you know
[1:28:36] try it sometime well because the
[1:28:40] minister broke the spell that was over
[1:28:42] you and God speaks straight to your
[1:28:44] heart nobody's want you to have okay now
[1:28:49] see then you think about the scriptures
[1:28:51] that we read we read in Matthew three
[1:28:57] that Jesus was on the River Jordan being
[1:29:00] baptized the voice came out of heaven
[1:29:03] and said this is my beloved son right
[1:29:09] this is my beloved Son in whom I'm
[1:29:12] pleased to dwell
[1:29:20] well I see you think that's his adoption
[1:29:23] that's not whether your profit covers it
[1:29:26] so hang on he goes for three years and
[1:29:30] I'll read to you where brother Branham
[1:29:32] says the hardest could ever be for three
[1:29:36] years
[1:29:37] he preaches the gospel he goes to Mount
[1:29:41] of Transfiguration then a voice from
[1:29:44] heaven said this is my beloved Son in
[1:29:46] whom I'm pleased to dwell here you him
[1:29:55] and brother Branham says God is gonna
[1:30:01] take this step back don't ever tried to
[1:30:06] get you to see it and I know it goes
[1:30:07] wrong because the human mind goes with
[1:30:10] it I have never tried to preach a group
[1:30:15] of people to a place to see how good
[1:30:17] they are because they know it's good
[1:30:21] enough to even talk about it
[1:30:23] right that's not throwing off on
[1:30:27] nobody's it's true that solves the
[1:30:29] problem all I've ever tried to do is get
[1:30:31] you to see what God has made you it is
[1:30:37] he that isn't there not we ourselves
[1:30:39] we're his people even to the bodies
[1:30:42] everything's all made of him and think
[1:30:46] about it the Lord Jesus now for three
[1:30:52] years he preaches the gospel he goes to
[1:30:57] Mount of Transfiguration he's adopted
[1:31:07] and he says this is my beloved Son in
[1:31:09] whom I'm police's the Doyle here you him
[1:31:12] in other words he said I'm not gonna I'm
[1:31:15] not gonna talk anymore
[1:31:18] if you get anything you're gonna hear it
[1:31:20] from him right listen we're gonna read
[1:31:26] you some things in a minute so just
[1:31:27] don't blank it out and say oh that's
[1:31:29] wrong
[1:31:29] no but then for through it for six
[1:31:33] months he had the most horrible time
[1:31:39] going from Calvary I mean to Mount of
[1:31:43] Transfiguration to Calvary adoption is
[1:31:49] to make our Father known is what I've
[1:31:52] been trying to get you to see for forty
[1:31:54] years it's not to make you known so that
[1:31:57] ought to get out of our minds and
[1:31:59] thinking it's not to make you know
[1:32:00] Normie known is to make him known then
[1:32:04] he makes us known by coming and doing
[1:32:06] the great wonders right but he it were
[1:32:08] supposed to make him known Jesus didn't
[1:32:10] come to make his own self known he come
[1:32:13] to make the father known seeing he knew
[1:32:17] was listen I was yesterday with the
[1:32:18] probably someone see he knew he had to
[1:32:20] give his life he knew he knew he had to
[1:32:25] come to die because the only way that
[1:32:27] man would ever be able to see God was
[1:32:30] for him to give his life and then let
[1:32:35] that come back upon the people to give
[1:32:40] them eternal life it's the only way
[1:32:44] what about coming into the world and
[1:32:46] knowing you understand what I'm saying
[1:32:49] he had a horrible three years in his
[1:32:53] life but then when he goes to Mount of
[1:32:57] Transfiguration instead of getting
[1:32:59] better it gets worse when he was
[1:33:02] manifested son of God coming up on the
[1:33:04] Mount of Transfiguration things got
[1:33:06] worse it didn't get better see we think
[1:33:10] it's supposed to get better it's
[1:33:11] supposed to do this and supposed to do
[1:33:13] that we're supposed to just get where we
[1:33:14] can just say it then that's how it just
[1:33:16] happens I've been in that ever since
[1:33:17] I've been in the message
[1:33:19] you know what I've always said you can't
[1:33:22] say it until you have it that's 45 years
[1:33:28] or more ago you can't say it until you
[1:33:31] get it all right and I don't mean get it
[1:33:36] by reading off the page
[1:33:37] I mean get it where God speaks in your
[1:33:40] heart and tells you to say it
[1:33:43] please to honor your word
[1:33:52] what about it but then he spent six
[1:33:55] months for the most horrible time could
[1:33:58] ever be thought of all he was trying to
[1:34:04] do was be good to mankind I used to
[1:34:08] think in the Baptist sense forgive me
[1:34:10] just going back there I used to thank
[1:34:12] for what why did they hate him all he
[1:34:16] ever done was good I mean he raised her
[1:34:20] daddy healed her sick he fed him he done
[1:34:23] everything and why did I hate him that's
[1:34:31] back in the bag beside at least thinking
[1:34:33] about it why did they hate him all he
[1:34:37] ever done was good all right here comes
[1:34:42] them they had a river Jordan right he
[1:34:47] was down there at the river Jordan this
[1:34:50] is my beloved son improves I'm pleased
[1:34:52] to dwell they don't go to hear him
[1:34:57] because he had to come through the
[1:34:59] tutorship the training and the position
[1:35:02] to come to Mount of Transfiguration then
[1:35:04] it would be hearing him not as he wasn't
[1:35:07] supposed to hear him during all that
[1:35:08] time but it meant something was going on
[1:35:13] now according to my Bible it says he
[1:35:17] learned obedience by the things he
[1:35:19] suffered and being made perfect he
[1:35:23] became right is that according to the
[1:35:28] Bible so you had three three years for
[1:35:31] him to go through that position
[1:35:33] are you listening but it got worse see
[1:35:36] when he went to the Mount of
[1:35:37] Transfiguration they started out trying
[1:35:41] to kill him
[1:35:44] what do you think about it now now I'm
[1:35:47] Transfiguration a life to fight it out
[1:35:51] with them demons and things to come to
[1:35:54] the position of the statue of a perfect
[1:35:56] man as we'll call it on the adoption of
[1:35:59] stages as we call it in the second stage
[1:36:03] then you think about it we had a little
[1:36:06] man called William Branham he has a Ohio
[1:36:10] River this is Bible son who won police
[1:36:15] the Doyle is that basically what was
[1:36:18] said about him
[1:36:18] I mean different wordings about but it
[1:36:21] didn't say here you him no more than it
[1:36:26] did to Jesus there but your prophet had
[1:36:29] 40 50 years maybe and we don't know that
[1:36:32] exact but I know one thing he said on
[1:36:34] the statue of a perfect man he said that
[1:36:36] it's been 30 years trying to get this to
[1:36:37] the people so you know you don't
[1:36:41] understand what I mean there was a gap
[1:36:42] and he fought it out with organized
[1:36:44] religions and I and why did they hate
[1:36:47] him all he ever done was heal the sick
[1:36:49] cast out the demons right he said I was
[1:36:56] listening one other day he said he was
[1:36:58] talking to the tabernacle he said they
[1:36:59] showed me one time I ever ask you for
[1:37:01] anything you know what I'm talking about
[1:37:05] what he was saying but he spent 30 40
[1:37:13] years maybe would just amount to a
[1:37:17] Ministry of coming through the statue of
[1:37:19] a perfect man coming through the
[1:37:21] adoption on stages coming through and
[1:37:23] then one day he was taken out in Arizona
[1:37:28] taken up and visited with angels we read
[1:37:31] it from the Prophet right I didn't bring
[1:37:36] that one but I'll go back and get in
[1:37:37] this there where he says talking about
[1:37:40] adoption to us he said take him out into
[1:37:42] the desert in other words take him out
[1:37:43] into and visit him with an angel see
[1:37:46] give him something and she just see here
[1:37:50] he comes in to the opening of those
[1:37:52] seven seals Derick Jeffersonville and
[1:37:57] begins to preach looks like the world
[1:38:00] would a flock - that looks like they
[1:38:03] would have just run after that and and
[1:38:04] run to it because he had come in this
[1:38:07] ministry and the things that had
[1:38:09] happened of the dead raised Mystic Hill
[1:38:11] if they've accepted it would have been
[1:38:13] greater they didn't accept it they got
[1:38:18] worse for him
[1:38:20] till he got were in his earthly ministry
[1:38:22] preached to 500,000 in his last day two
[1:38:25] or three maybe ten or something in a
[1:38:28] trailer I believe he was adopted out
[1:38:34] there in Tucson you can think he was
[1:38:35] adopted here now
[1:38:36] but you can't find a place to lay the
[1:38:38] scripture if you understand what I'm
[1:38:39] just saying the Lord Jesus went
[1:38:41] transfert went to the River Jordan any
[1:38:44] goes to transfiguration brother Branham
[1:38:48] would go from the River Jordan Ohio
[1:38:50] River to his life and come out to word
[1:38:53] that he would stand out there and no
[1:38:55] seven seals would break which listen is
[1:38:57] the plan of redemption
[1:38:59] the seals now listen you hear this
[1:39:03] wording but listen please the seals was
[1:39:07] not to say for the redemption of the
[1:39:09] body that had already been preached for
[1:39:12] 2,000 years right
[1:39:16] the seal I mean excuse me the the seals
[1:39:19] was not for the new birth let me get it
[1:39:22] in the right order and supposed to it
[1:39:24] was not to just a new birth the new
[1:39:25] birth is preached from Calvary all the
[1:39:27] way down I mean through the book of Acts
[1:39:29] to out to 2,000 years it's preaching the
[1:39:32] new birth but it was laughte then as he
[1:39:43] was bringing those seals he got unless
[1:39:44] him less and less and less did people
[1:39:47] come to hear him the message that would
[1:39:54] show you the redemption of the body
[1:39:56] brother branham stairs
[1:39:59] marriage and divorce was revealed in the
[1:40:03] seals come on
[1:40:06] he said the rapture was revealed in the
[1:40:10] seals right did he have a wonderful time
[1:40:17] after the seals broke he did but the
[1:40:25] world didn't want it no more they turned
[1:40:28] against him
[1:40:34] he finished his message and God took him
[1:40:39] off the scene right
[1:40:43] for what reason for you and me as you
[1:40:49] see he had in that life coming down
[1:40:54] through there
[1:40:55] he had a Mount Carmel experience
[1:41:01] he fought out with Elijah I mean with
[1:41:03] the bailiff and all of those things he
[1:41:07] had a Mount Carmel experience brother
[1:41:08] Brennan said ever born-again believer
[1:41:10] will have a Mount Carmel experience so
[1:41:18] then can you see wherever you accepted
[1:41:22] Jesus Christ as your Savior maybe before
[1:41:25] you heard the message you know that's
[1:41:27] okay I'll go with you if you put one
[1:41:32] time the word that the Prophet brought
[1:41:35] is the more important to me now than it
[1:41:38] was back under cause back there I just
[1:41:39] shot it up few wheels so if you go that
[1:41:42] way we go okay the new birth three
[1:41:45] stages of adoption right
[1:41:47] a new birth manifestation of sons and
[1:41:52] daughter and then to understand the
[1:41:55] redemption of the body see where have
[1:41:58] you heard of the message because they
[1:41:59] were all individuals now so we're coming
[1:42:01] so put yourself to yourself to the point
[1:42:05] you receive the new birth one day that
[1:42:08] was your adoption into the family of God
[1:42:11] as a baby
[1:42:13] you had to have that adoption to bring
[1:42:16] you in because you were not even a Jew
[1:42:18] to to have any lineages or anything I
[1:42:20] was trying to explain while ago you had
[1:42:23] the new birth come and it gave you
[1:42:25] eternal life in your soul but it didn't
[1:42:29] redeem the body it laid claim I'm in the
[1:42:31] future home so come on butter brown says
[1:42:34] he laid claim on that body when that new
[1:42:38] birth came in to your soul it laid a
[1:42:41] claim on to the that body and spirit
[1:42:43] that it would one day eventually even if
[1:42:47] it's got to go by the grave and come out
[1:42:50] it will come into full eternity why
[1:42:53] because he claimed it right there right
[1:42:57] that new birth made you rightful owners
[1:43:03] of glory because of everyone he owns we
[1:43:08] own hive of it I like it like that don't
[1:43:11] you
[1:43:12] heirs and joint heirs Paul says in
[1:43:15] Romans but listen see then you started
[1:43:20] through life you heard of the message
[1:43:21] some of you received the new birth after
[1:43:24] hearing of the message that's fine I can
[1:43:26] put monies from the end of that because
[1:43:28] when I come into this message I was in
[1:43:30] this message for two years before ever
[1:43:31] received the baptism of the Holy Ghost I
[1:43:33] don't have no problems with that no
[1:43:36] problem with anybody else everybody's
[1:43:37] told me you know what brother Dale you
[1:43:39] believe the message yeah I was reading
[1:43:40] six books and listening to tapes and
[1:43:42] today you ever done that
[1:43:44] I just dedicated my whole life to this
[1:43:47] message because if it's going to be a
[1:43:49] mess he's going to be a prophet that's
[1:43:50] what I told brother moe he said this he
[1:43:54] was a prophet I said tell me what he
[1:43:56] told I said you tell me you saw the dead
[1:43:59] razor sit here I didn't see it you tell
[1:44:01] me what he talked I said what he told
[1:44:03] I'll I'll have an understanding and I'll
[1:44:06] it'll be in the Word of God thank God
[1:44:08] for giving me the man that could do that
[1:44:10] that he could just quote it to me for
[1:44:12] all of those years that we stayed
[1:44:14] together that we could walk in the word
[1:44:19] [Music]
[1:44:21] what about it
[1:44:25] you ever had an experience see now you
[1:44:29] see why I preach so much on the nuber
[1:44:31] and how you had to have an experience of
[1:44:34] justification and experience of
[1:44:36] sanctification experience of the baptism
[1:44:38] of the Holy Ghost to have the new birth
[1:44:41] you think I just hollered and screamed
[1:44:44] in the act you know no I was preaching
[1:44:46] the gospel that we'll see this afternoon
[1:44:48] when we drop back to Martin Luther that
[1:44:51] was predestinated seed not Martin Luther
[1:44:57] not to flex now come on predestinated
[1:45:01] seed of the just shall live by faith
[1:45:06] predestinated eternally from God come on
[1:45:13] I know the message come on York to the
[1:45:15] registers not to personally country
[1:45:16] destiny eternally it's the word of seed
[1:45:18] all right so we got it in the right
[1:45:20] order when we go back to Luther and you
[1:45:23] see Luther standing iron and what he had
[1:45:25] and to see that you started your new
[1:45:27] birth right there
[1:45:28] in that same way not there with him but
[1:45:31] with justification that when God chopped
[1:45:37] off you PI since then you went to
[1:45:41] sanctification cleansing and setting
[1:45:43] aside under John Wesley's message and in
[1:45:48] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:45:49] under the Azusa Street baptism because
[1:45:54] it's the same baptism right you remember
[1:45:59] the little word the other week of
[1:46:02] dispensation and why brother Branham
[1:46:05] would say he believed in a dispensation
[1:46:07] but then he'd turn around and say I
[1:46:08] don't believe in a dispensation
[1:46:12] what's he doing he's exactly right said
[1:46:17] dispensation can't change you can't
[1:46:22] change you have a dispensation of the
[1:46:26] Holy Ghost is going all the way
[1:46:28] dispensation of just really above all
[1:46:30] the way if it's a dispensation of the
[1:46:33] Holy Ghost you'll go all the way
[1:46:39] see he was saying anything that stays
[1:46:43] and right will continue home so I
[1:46:45] believe in a dispensation
[1:46:48] then it's he'd say but see said if these
[1:46:51] things fall off now and it ends and
[1:46:53] something goes wrong and you lose that
[1:46:55] he said that's not a dispensation that's
[1:46:58] you called it that but I called it that
[1:47:00] because it didn't continue I hope you
[1:47:03] caught that last week but listen and
[1:47:06] then one day you'll get to the
[1:47:08] dispensation cause now listen I believe
[1:47:14] that the Lord Jesus went through that
[1:47:16] this is my beloved Son in whom I'm
[1:47:18] pleased to dwell went through his life
[1:47:20] three years and then he comes out two
[1:47:22] goes to Mount of Transfiguration and
[1:47:24] says this is my beloved Son in whom I'm
[1:47:26] pleased to dwell here you him I'm going
[1:47:30] to back off I've got him here to me
[1:47:32] don't read I'm gonna back off jingle
[1:47:34] hear me no longer you're gonna hear him
[1:47:36] but he's gonna make me manifest cuz what
[1:47:40] did I say to start with the son is not
[1:47:42] the one to be made manifest you think
[1:47:44] it's you to be made manifest boy you got
[1:47:46] a blowed up head it's not you to be made

[1:48:43] because you got to be done okay now come
[1:48:45] on anywhere you had an experience you
[1:48:48] started off as a new birth
[1:48:52] then you're gonna have a period of
[1:48:54] tutoring and training from the new birth
[1:48:57] you're gonna have a time but through the
[1:48:59] statue of a perfect man to bring out the
[1:49:02] virtues into the individual and in one
[1:49:05] day the headstones gonna strike the
[1:49:07] church all right let's see I believe
[1:49:11] that but what is the headstone to the
[1:49:14] church what if I told you is the
[1:49:16] headstone to the jury the seven seals
[1:49:18] cause what else is it if the cornerstone
[1:49:21] is the word then the headstones got its
[1:49:23] people word right come on be sensible
[1:49:26] that's the cornerstone is the word we
[1:49:28] don't at the Baptist Church go wake up
[1:49:32] we could read they become the head of
[1:49:35] the corner but around this use it like
[1:49:38] this one day he says becomes the
[1:49:39] headstone of the corner because he
[1:49:43] brought it into more of his
[1:49:44] understanding of where he was going with
[1:49:46] it okay give me a couple of more minutes
[1:49:49] but listen the Lord Jesus went through
[1:49:56] that and came out to the message you
[1:49:58] know he preached six seals Matthew 24 he
[1:50:05] preached six healed
[1:50:06] oh yeah the Prophet preached the seals
[1:50:14] the book came alive he said what about
[1:50:16] it he said since the opening of the
[1:50:19] seals he said the Bible became a brand
[1:50:20] new book right not a different book more
[1:50:26] of that that he had read all of his life
[1:50:29] now comes into VA into being and be
[1:50:32] viewed you know and seeing the revealing
[1:50:36] of the word so you're gonna have your
[1:50:38] own Mount Carmel experience so you're
[1:50:43] gonna have a place that you got a new
[1:50:44] birth and that's to bring you into the
[1:50:48] body of Christ or adopt you into the
[1:50:50] body of Christ as a baby a new birth not
[1:50:53] headstones not anything else I see then
[1:50:57] you get to tutorship statue of a perfect
[1:50:59] lamb well one day God's gonna take you
[1:51:03] out on the backside
[1:51:04] esra he's gonna visit you with an angel
[1:51:10] and he's gonna tell you what this
[1:51:12] prophet said is right you like that well
[1:51:17] you think he's gonna tell you
[1:51:18] you think he's gonna tell you something
[1:51:20] your cousin s that or the other you know
[1:51:24] where I was at when the Lord revealed
[1:51:26] the seals to me General Motors had a job
[1:51:33] that nobody could run they couldn't run
[1:51:36] it long enough for me to take a 16
[1:51:38] minute break I had to help the man that
[1:51:41] had to know Joe I couldn't be out he
[1:51:47] took two people to run the job when I
[1:51:48] was out to see my hands with it that day
[1:51:53] I used to Dolph in the cotton mill and
[1:51:55] do working okay when the man the boss
[1:51:58] that hard or put me through on the job
[1:51:59] he said I'll guarantee you all look at
[1:52:01] the next record
[1:52:02] he said if I can see a doll for Alva
[1:52:04] cotton mill he said I'll put him on a
[1:52:05] job because they put me on the job it
[1:52:08] was supposed to take three days to learn
[1:52:10] in 15 minutes I was doing it and told a
[1:52:13] man go take care of his business
[1:52:14] I always had the whole job at one time I
[1:52:20] could run over 40 something jobs I had
[1:52:25] that good of a memory that I was
[1:52:28] absentee replacement for 40-something
[1:52:30] people but listen when he opened that
[1:52:34] first seal to me I was picking this
[1:52:38] piece of paper up and laying it down
[1:52:40] because it matched up and I had to make
[1:52:42] sure this compared to this to this and
[1:52:44] then I lay it down her necks in Italy it
[1:52:46] had to be an order of sequences etc and
[1:52:51] I could do that job within about 40
[1:52:53] seconds out of 60 you know what that
[1:52:56] gave me 20 seconds to write you don't
[1:53:00] try 20 seconds
[1:53:05] I'd write now
[1:53:06] and lay it down write down let that
[1:53:09] write down lately just like that
[1:53:12] wrote a whole page I don't ever do this
[1:53:17] heaven help you ministers don't even
[1:53:19] listen to what I'm fixing this life but
[1:53:22] I've got a I'll just put it I can find
[1:53:27] out something if I need it and so I I
[1:53:31] just said well Lord I want to see if
[1:53:35] this is you I turned around to the man
[1:53:39] on the other side of the line and told
[1:53:41] him a joke
[1:53:41] now I'm not dirty I don't tell dirty
[1:53:43] jokes I'm talking about a joke just told
[1:53:45] him a joke I turned right back around
[1:53:49] picked that pin up started riding it
[1:53:52] never ended it a tended to this day when
[1:53:57] he showed me he said here stanza I'm the
[1:54:02] lamb with a book in his hand and said
[1:54:04] out there goes the white horse rider he
[1:54:08] said that's two people spam and ain't no
[1:54:12] two people there's just one that's how
[1:54:17] simple the opening of the word if I hear
[1:54:21] anybody say any more about how great
[1:54:23] what it is to tell me even more than
[1:54:25] that right there I'll tell you I don't
[1:54:26] believe it because that was how simple
[1:54:29] he said there's only one I said anytime
[1:54:33] in the Bible you see two he said one of
[1:54:35] them is the devil so that's always been
[1:54:38] my goal in this message or anywhere or
[1:54:41] somebody preaching I watch what you're
[1:54:43] doing with a Godhead i watch the way
[1:54:49] you're approaching the Godhead I don't
[1:54:53] care if it's wade who it is I watch it
[1:54:56] because my life is involved right I see
[1:55:02] what you're doing with the Godhead cuz
[1:55:04] you ain't got to Godhead right you ain't
[1:55:05] got to message right let Stan come on
[1:55:07] I'm sorry what I'm just saying yeah I
[1:55:11] had an experience with the baptism with
[1:55:13] the Holy Ghost and I spent twenty thirty
[1:55:17] years
[1:55:18] studying this message the 19 in 82 so
[1:55:24] that would have put me from 68 to 82
[1:55:28] studying this message and the Lord
[1:55:32] showed me the opening of the seals you
[1:55:36] say you try to make yourself something
[1:55:38] no I'm just telling the truth
[1:55:40] it happened and I saw it that's how
[1:55:46] simple it is to you if you think about
[1:55:47] it think about your your life going
