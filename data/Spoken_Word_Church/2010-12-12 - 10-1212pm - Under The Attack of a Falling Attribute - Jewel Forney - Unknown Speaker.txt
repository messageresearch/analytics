I got I did get a little bit of rest believe it or not so we thank God just I appreciate Brother Sam giving us opportunity to be here fellowship with you this evening I'm going to go right to the word of the Lord this evening I'm not going to hold you all day so don't get nervous um I'm going read from the book of Genesis 3 Genesis the 3rd Chapter a simple thought I've been preaching on thought may be a blessing to you this evening amen Genesis 3 and I'm going to read verse 9 verse 10 and it reads like this and the Lord God called unto Adam and said unto him who are th and he said I heard thy voice in the garden and I was afraid because I was naked and I hid myself let's prayer I'm gracious father one more time Lord give me strength Lord give me help me to heal my body God help me to heal my mind Lord help me to get out of the way this evening God now father God take over this service in the name of Jesus Jesus we pray amen may we SE it one more time um thank the Lord for the reading of the word of God this evening amen as I Ti from the word of God is it says here in Genesis he said Adam said I I heard thy voice and I hid myself right right and in other words he had heard God's voice no doubt many times before but this time when you hear God's voice something had took place something had happened in his life transpired in his life that caused Adam to say I was afraid if you ever thought about that he never mentioned that where he never heard God say that word before but this first time it been mentioned he expressed something that God never spoke to him right so I took I took from that and I talked on under the attack of a fallen attribute amen H in other words and I took it because I realized here that Adam had fell under the attack of attribute that did not come from God right and I begin to look at them thing and I begin to realize here and we begin because Adam because Adam had become conscious of pharoh he had come conscious of something that God had never said amen right and I begin to look at this and I begin to think on them things and I begin to here that's what we all got to fight against we all got to fight against Fen attributes things that God had never said right and word God not in in word the devil tried to get God he tried to get Jesus to make him God if you fall down and worship me I give you the kingdoms of this world so we know that what the S Kingdom It could only be Darkness it could have only been death it could have been only sickness it could have only been fur H but Jesus said I refuse to bite out to this attribute that's right Amen in other words I refuse to give you that position Satan so I begin to look at and I begin to think and think on anything so now I begin to realize here that we got to war against it but now want to talk about the thing that the church fight the hardest yeah amen what good is this talk about you know we can look at denomination we can look at all the things around us but I want to talk about the thing that the church fight the most how I going to look at something that we got to deal with and we got to overcome because we realize here we are in The Exodus and exodus is in the two- part come out of and go into how we got to fight we got to deal with the spirit that caused them not to cross over you ever thought about that it was a spirit that followed that Revival that caus them not to cross over to the promised land and I begin to think of them thing and I'm going to try to find out what was the spirit that started that CA them when they come out because when they come out of Egypt Egypt was the type of the world maybe they quit drinking smoking and doing them but once they come out this the battle changes right right no longer Satan fighting with this and no longer Satan fighting us with drinking smoking running around with women and things so now he got to change the battle right sure the test come different so now we need to look at some things in the scripture uh uh uh this morning and begin to try to uh maybe go through the scripture and uh just might okay and let just go to the scripture I'm going to go to Exodus the 16th chapter see can we find out what stopped him from crossing over right and find out if we can nail this attribute down this falling attribute then we can but then we can follow this thing and see do it ever change because remember Satan found one way of stopping the church from going over he will keep on using that same technique all the way through so we begin to look him after this the 16 chapter and I'm going to begin reading brother way I'm going to let you read for me brother not the seven verse down through the eth 7eventh and 8th yeah and in the morning then you shall see the glory of the Lord for that he had heareth your murmurings against the Lord wait a minute I want you to notice something in the morning you should see the glory of the Lord but when God showed up they should have been praising him they should have been giv him glory but when he prayed when he showed up there was muming right right and what are we that ye murmur against us and Moses said this shall be when the Lord shall give you in the evening flesh to eat and in the morning bread to the full for that the Lord heareth your murmurings which you murmur against him and what are we your murmurings are not against us but against the Lord right so now we find here he was on the way out Satan sto them finding fault with God right go down to the 17th chapter brother well we want to bring that one in 17th chapter verse two all the way down through verse three verse 2 and three we have verse 2 3 4 excuse me okay wherefore the people did CH with Moses and said give us water that we may drink and Moses said unto them why Chad ye with me wherefore do ye tempt the Lord and the people thirsted there for water and the people murmured against Moses and said wherefore is this that thou has brought us up out of Egypt to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst and Moses Cried unto the Lord saying what shall I do unto this people they be almost ready to Stone me so now we find I want you to notice here what we seen in this picture here he was God done blessed them them that gave water but still they mumbled H so now we find here that Satan called the people to worship and a fallen attribute right amen now begin to look it up you know what brother Jord didn't stop how do no it didn't stop because once Satan see he can stop them from going in he's I'm going to use this all so now if you notice here he never stopped there so now he took it in the first an this y he stopped him with mumbling and complaining H he stopped him by mumbling y let me see what he did in the second and we go to U the book of uh St John 6 St John 6 and I'm going to begin read at the 41st verse St John 6 41 verse and then the Jews mum and him because he said I am the bread which come came down from heaven and and they said it is is this not Jus the son of Joseph whom father and who father whom father and mother we know how is it then that he said I come came down from heaven and Jesus therefore understanding and Jesus excuse me Jesus answer and said unto them in other words why in m not among yourself why did that Spirit show up in the new Testament right right why did that Spirit came all the way from Moses time here go Jesus coming in the second act and it was the same spirit that same Spirit was following Jesus ministry and it was following Moses Ministry and then follow this ministry today amen the people today it ain't the people doing so much commit D all these but the people the biggest problem with the church in the message is mumbling right right HJ so we begin to go so Jesus knew these things let me jump down to the 16 verse to can of save time and then let me see here so J let me let me back up excuse me so J begin to explain this right he begin to he begin to explain his ministry and I'm going to get with the 51st verse that begin I'm the living bread which came down from heaven If any man eat of this bread he shall live forever and the bread that I give the bread I will give is my My Flesh right and that my flesh which I will give for the life of the world then he goes and says here the Jew therefore SC among thems saying how can this man give us his flesh to eat they could not tap in on the Revelation they were trying to get Revelation by flesh H and you can not understand God by flesh because Jesus said Flesh and Blood never give this to you and then Jesus answer said and Jesus said unto them ver ver I say unto you except you eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood y have no life so now he bring this mysterious Revelation to them without expl explaining right then he said whosoever shall eat my flesh and drink my blood have eternal life and I will raise him up at the last day for my flesh is meat indeed and my blood is drink indeed he that eateth my flesh and drinking my blood dwelleth in me and I in him as the father and as the father living has sent me and I live by the father so he that eat me right even he shall live by me right this is the bread which came down from heaven not as your father did eat Mana in the your father had mana and are dead how that eternally separated after it come out right he that eat eat of this bread shall live forever amen and he this thing said he in the synagogue as he taught and say and many of and many therefor of the disciple when they he this y when they heard this if they hard say who can he yeah right and when Jesus know remember the word know the spirits right so the word would be begin to discern the spirit because that same spirit that was in the book of AG was showing up here and Jesus had come in contact with the spirit and he began to deal with the same Spirit right of the same thing that people do all the time M and Jesus says him and Jesus knew him himself and that his not with church people by the way you know the world body it's the church people that there was people that said they loved him there were people that went to church the acist were church people [Music] right so Jesus said it to them and Jesus said and Jesus said and Jesus said said to his disciples that his disciples Mur at it and he said unto them does this offend you yeah and then he go to and said what if you see the son of man the son of man Ascend up where he was before right where he was before right it is the spirit quick the flesh Propet nothing nothing but the word I speak to you they are spirit and they are life and but there are some of you that what right H the attribute of a falling nature H was mumbling that's the sign of unbelief right that was the sign that he know that something was wrong some of you that believe not for Jesus knew from the beginning who they they were that believe not and who shall betray him right the word knows all things so he was not cut off of God he was not he was not he was not took by surprise he knew that was a fallen attribute he knew that Satan was following him and he knew that same was going to church i i m right then he says here in the 65th verse he says and he said and he said therefore I say unto you that no man can come no man can come unto me except it was given to him of my father right from that time what did the spirit do same thing it did in the book of Exodus it was going to stop them from going in to for for the word for that hour so any words so once he got this mumbling in there he was able to stop them for going all the way with the word h he was not concerned how long they' been in church he was concerned in them that they don't get to the book of he says from that time show you what happened to him the last stage of that Fallen attribute right he said from that time find and she said therefore he said oh no no in the the 66 verse he said from that time many of the disciples went back and walk no more with him if you go back if you didn't walk no more with God how if you went back and you never come back to God that mean that you're going actually eternally separated from God is happen for St John the 6th chapter and the 66 verse he scrapped them off the book they went how they refus to walk in the light and they refuse to walk in the light what the what what was the problem why didn't he walk in the light why did he keep F Jesus because they could not understand him right exactly exactly they could not comprehend they tried to have tried to understand Supernatural Revelation with with natural understanding so now Jesus come to the after he done got rid of all them cuz they couldn't they was there Ming and complaining so Jesus said I got rid of that crowd right there let me go and deal with the rest of now you remember Judah stayed in his Revival to the end yeah yeah right cuz he was he'll be so close so he stayed and followed his Revival to the End Amen that's right so we find here so we find here in the 67 verse and then Jesus said unto the 12 will you also go in other words you all your buddies leaving all your church people leaving cuz I'm preaching this Revelation so you also go with them and then what what Simon Peter said and and then Simon Peter answered and said Lord whom shall we go that has the words of eternal life he said for we believe and are sure that th the Son of God the the we we we we believe that the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus answer said them I have I have have not I chosen you 12 and one of you is a d and then word so he said I you and he spoke of Judah is the son of Simon for he for he it was that shall betray him and him being being one of the 12 so he am I chose you but one was chosen Hallelujah he was never chosen for eternal life he was chosen to reject the word oh he was chosen to have confusion and and cause him to be scratched away of the book H we begin to look here I looked up the word muming and complaint and the word CH is the same word muming it it came from the word mumbling complaining and shine is the same word it us it if you were break look it up it means to find fault to blame or to find fault with somebody I said if you go back and you follow the message how do you follow the people to run the message the biggest problem we got is finding fault somebody always got something bad to say about somebody else somebody looking at somebody mistak that run somebody down we find fult we find blame and somebody always we better my church is better than your church we dressed in we more holy than you we always try to find folk to put this church down put that CH is on the dev right now we going to look here that Spirit just just stop down oh no once he got once Satan use the technique he keep on and keep on he may change it up he might change it meod but he don't change that Spirit right right so what he do he go on here and we find Paul picks it up and when Paul said it in Hebrews Hebrews 11 and verse Hebrews 3 verse 7 he said God swore that he would not let him enter into his rest what because not because they was not drinking not because they were smoking just because they kept finding F right right amen right just because they kept complaining just because they couldn't come to the Revelation how let God and just praise God for who he is but every trying to find fault I see something but there no fault in him because when they prove the word they could not find fault in christly so we begin to go look here let's just look at this thing a little closer we talking about mly complaining and falling attributes that been following this message been following the people around this message that there was so many wars going on spiritually speaking pastors fighting against Pastor people's in the church fighting against people in the church people leaving the church when people leave the church what it what it big thing if you go back and you n now they found fault right they found somebody to blame for something they couldn't overcome and they they found somebody that they found some do maybe some Revelation that maybe they could not understand so the bir say the preacher preach false do I'm leaving yeah how do you say preach a f doctor you don't even understand the Revelation how do you need to ask God to give you a revelation how do so sometime people jump up how maybe it might go look maybe they have a mar situation they trying to find somebody to shoot down make a court so they can overcome or do a certain thing and maybe the message won't let them do it so that's I got to find somewhere else that's right so we got to find fault we got to find blame y so it ain't nobody to blame the point of then we got to come back and recognize how God we all human being and we all got failure we all got weakness but that one perfect person in our M and that's Jesus Christ and there ain't no fault in him so we begin to go look at him so as I begin to narrow us down so it kept moving the spirit kept moving and the last place I saw the Spirit manifested showed his head up again and he showed his head up in the book of Jude M yep he showed his head up in the book of JW last book before Revelation so you see when the spirit started it didn't never was just stop right it it moved from Exodus all the way down to the New Testament all the way down to Matthew it moved into the book of Beth look John has been moved there under Jesus ministry now after the Holy Ghost the spirit was still moving among the people right how it never Chang it kept moving all the way through the book how the 16th verse brother uh wait 16 yeah these are murmurers complainers walking after their own lust and their mouth speaketh great swelling words having men's persons in admiration because of Advantage okay if you notice here The Same Spirit it now Paul Jude picks it up said he are M and complainers in in words walking out their own lust honey once you don't see the word you going to be L by some kind of spirit once you find fault with the word it don't leave you become bable for any type of a spirit to take you over how we find fault everybody B here so Paul said I got to do something like this I got to give the people something how that they can overcome this spr right I I can't leave a pain I they got to they got to let go the spirit how do we go long as we find fault with each other we have to find fault with God because that what God do right so Paul said I got to come up with something I got to knock the spirit in the head once and for all so Paul picks up Philippians 2 and verse 14 Paul says here do all things yeah what do all things mean it mean all things right that mean that if it's all thing it cover everything yeah they say do all things without mumbling and complain without mumbling and dispute Hallelujah in other words in other words telling you here in other without hardship without suffering H take no thought on tomorrow for God know what you have need of before you even ask right the reason people M and get ahead of God because they don't want to trust him right so if God don't give them something today then they really complain about it tomorrow hallu if God don't give me no shoes hallu I know what I'm going to do H so they begin to complain how do they build they build a complain because they didn't have water they build a complain because they didn't have food but God said take no thought on what you going to eat or what you going wi I have know what you need of there's nothing to complain about when you know God is in control am the complaint is when you're not really sure that God going to stand behind his word how so now it build up a question will God provide for me will God do what he say going to do H but it a your business to tell God how to run this business it's your job to accept God Peter said we are sure right I'm sure that you're doing what you say you going to do God and I'm going to stay with this word all the way to the end how do I'm not going to let nothing come and and I'm not going to stir up here I ain't got nothing to complain about how do I got shoes on my feet I got food on my table I got a roof on my head how Lord I want to thank you for your blessings on me Mom complaining and I realized here as I begin to study this thing here that attribute right there is what we got to deal with right because that what we find we find so many SLP rocks around the message Wy Wy W every wouldn't for hard Lu I wouldn't have none at all but I don't care I don't create that spiritual ra me there you go how I don't go around talking about hard Lu I don't put up a hard time how do I don't I don't know where somebody say well I'm putting up I'm putting my eggs in there a hard time if you bleed out you w't have hard time but I don't put up a all time I just say one thing I say that God know who hold I know who hold tomorrow H and God said I never leave you or forsake you I'll be with you all the way to the end of the world it ain't nothing to complain about right am right nothing to complain about right but the attribute what we're dealing with this attribute right here have been falling this be falling every Revival and then got into it and caus a problem every every Church in had his had a spirit would get in every Church in and Satan would come in and what do he do he comes and start the people's the mumbling and complaining after this revival been over for years the Rapture didn't take play what do the people say all forget it we been talking about the Rapture going take play and look we still here well you better keep believing God because it going to take place don't matter when I think it going to take place all I know I'm believing the whole on is going to take place so I'm going to live the way always I'm going to live just like he's coming the next 5 minutes if I'm going to plant potatoes I'm going to plant potatoes I'm not going to lay it up but I'm not going to build a house because God come say be F doing something I right here and get out of right he begin to he did with a little message say on and he says here and I use it I tied this in with this he says in the message uh yeah yeah s NE he says the God of this world today the the worship person of this world today is Satan and the peoples are ignorant worship is Satan but it is Satan impersonate himself as the church as the called out ones as the one said I'm going in the Rapture how in other words he got he want to deal with the people this religious spirit it follows the church he gets in the church and he stays in the church the called out group that's the one he want to deal with right as the church they are worshiping Satan thinking they worshiping God oh yeah though though through the church but it is the way Satan has done it how did he do it like did he kept the people in the P right right amen the Bible say let us be content in all things right it's hard for people to get the mind of contentment it's all for the people to bed how that God ain't going to stand behind his word I got so many people go here and everybody worri about what we going to do what we going to do about the economy I don't care about the economy my God is able to provide in the midst of the whole thing I'm not going around putting myself to sleep complaining about what's going on when I serve a God that own the child of him he I never seen the right or SE bre what I got to worry about we got a group down herebody complaining I wonder God going to stay here I going to lose everything I got wor I'm going this going to happen I said people I said that that's the less of my problems right I don't I don't lose sleep over houses I don't lose sleep over cars and all this stuff going to go away anyway but my God say take no thought on the things right that's right amen he go to the say so when he deal with this thing he goes back in and I'm I'm just deal with this and say Satan is the most worship person of this day he impersonated himself as the church and in the church they were still complain when it came out of the book of Exodus it was the call up the church amen so they were still complaining we are not church we bride are we wife amen we not even we wife now so we should we come here so we begin to realize here so why did he Nar it down because he going to n you he bringing his attribute down he exposing a fallen attribute and we find here today people say well brother je they said they said well I'm so sad well that sad that that sadness didn't come from God right that was a bed attribute so what Jesus came doing if you notice in the book of he the why you sad because he knew there was an attribute that was not of him so he goes to S NE and I was dealing with this and S he said and then you are a you are one of his attributes from his own body God has attribut in his body like you are an attribute of your father and I took this right here because this is what Jesus begin to deal with the spirit and bring out to show you what seed was which who which which one was of God which one was of the Devil by attributes yeah how the way they respond the way they act the attributes they speak it tells where they come from amen so Jesus goes in s uh St John the 8th chapter I want to look at this here because it deals with attributes St John the 8th chapter let's de here if you notice here when Jesus get to St John the 8th chapter he start preaching serpy he began to identify who SE was God and which SE was under devil right he didn't make he didn't he didn't play around with it he goes right to it and he begin to let them know if you were the attribute of this seed you would do this so he go to St John 8 St John 8th chapter I'm going to begin to look at this here he deals with this St John 8th chapter and I want to begin reading at the 3 7 maybe I go up a little forward to this the 31st verse down to the 31 and then he says here and then Jesus said to those Jews which beli on him if ye continue in my word then ye are my what in other words if you continue in my word what would make him not continue in the word the only way they would continue in the word you must have to find fault with it you must have to find some kind of blame it you got to find that something is wrong with it order not to stay with it how once you a once you not content that the word going to do what say you got to find some other CH exactly so Jesus says him he said and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free amen they answered him now who they responding Jesus told them what to do I'm going to tell you who see you because now we taking a DNA test yeah and why when I get through with this test you'll know what side of the fish you on right so here they go they go back and they said we be Abraham SE oh yeah all right that a testifying we are religious we are in the message and we Abraham SE L said we be brother bread and seeds that don't make you going inter R that's right that a what God looking for he's not judging you by the body when Brandon he's judging you by the revelation of Jesus Christ amen so but a lot of people because they know brother Brandon they making the rtion that don't mean no more than you know the Poke right right H that ain't what God judg you by God judge you by receiving the spiritual Revelation I don't care who the vessel is if it's the Holy Ghost speaking and you receive the Revelation you speaking to God but they thought just because they can prove that they've been circumcised In the Flesh and they can prove it absolutely they can prove that they every one of those guys that was said there every one of them have been proven to be circumcised and they can prove by the circumcision we are Abraham seed in the flesh but God was dealing with the flesh right he was dealing with the soul how did he deal with the Revelation right so he goes on and says him they said and they answer him and said we be aaham SE and will will not in abondance to any man how say how say dust y shall be made free and Jesus answered and said unto them ver ver I say unto you whoo committed sin is the what H other words whosoever commits sin is the servant of sin and if you committed sin you cannot be the attribute of God because sin cannot dwell in Goden so people make Jesus make Jesus look like he and Jesus didn't have no s how Jesus never had Jesus never was born under under under a fallen attribute that way he never was he just became it right right H but he never sin in the first place right why he didn't s because he didn't have a past life right you could look back at Jesus life to say your grandfather done this and your great grandmother was a scripper and your great grandpa was a bootle and all when you look back to Jesus life he didn't even have a pth and if he didn't have a pth how can you look like and say he only when you look at you can only see his future where he come from how so Jesus was made Perfection that why we go back and get I we do away with our past life so we can stand before God justifi right right and he says 35th verse it say and the servant abided not in the house forever but the son abide forever amen if the son therefore shall make you free yes shall be free indeed I know that you are Abraham's seed but ye see to do what did it come from God no that did not come from God that's right so the attribute that they was expressing did not come from God because if that would have been God why would they want to kill a man right right that trying to tell them the truth Glory why would you want to kill your pastor or a preacher that's preaching the truth right because truth uncovers what attributes you are right so now he took the truth and as he spoke the word it be to reveal who it was right and then he says here he said I I know you're abam see but you seek to kill me me because my word uhoh has no place that's right in you am a word is a thought of God expressed how the word of God had to have you on his mind or or else you could never be Express how God got to see in his mind how what God look at that why God can look down here and say Matthew 7:21 say I never knew you right after all the signs and W they did he said I never knew you right it goes back with you in the word right right P did he says him then he says to them right here my word has no place in you and then the 38th verse I spake that which I have seen of my father I say it now we say he said you the attribute of your father right Jesus is expressing I am the attribute of my father so now he if you notice here he's going back to two daddies or two fathers he's telling them I am the attribute of my father in other words what he say I am the mystery of God revealed H when you see me you see the father when you see me you don't see my V but Jesus said when you see me you see my V why because he was the very revelation of God hallah he was just God had Tabernacle himself and skin and he revealed himself through Christ so the revelation of God was walking on skin so now he was he said he said he said he said he would tell tell him he said I am the 38 verse he get he said he said I speak that what I speak that which I have seen of my father and and yet do that which you have seen with your father I done this what I seen with my father and you are doing that what you have seen your father if you notice here what was he doing he separating them by attributes right because they had something that was in there them that never will part of God right to murder somebody right so he knew that they was Fallen attributes they could be religious but they could never come to the knowledge of the message amen and watch what he said and they answered and said unto him Abraham is our father they still try to hold to the confession they still try to hold to the confession Abraham is and Jesus said unto them if you were Abraham children they would do the works of Abraham yeah right so now he putting it back there he keep going back and forth if you notice the battle is back and forth how they they they putting claims on Abraham and Jesus said you know it can't be what would he dealing with he was not dealing with because they was good people you could not look at their life and find anything that was wrong with them that's right they was Pharisees they were religious people but Jesus was looking at their DNA he was looking at their spiritual genealogy he knew that they didn't nothing to do with Abraham he knew they wouldn't part of him right Jesus said right here the before but you seek to kill me why couldn't they get away from that Spirit oh yeah why did that Spirit keep riding and bringing this influence to want to murder him he said y seek the kill me premeditated murder they were premeditating to kill an innocent man and then what they eventually did they premeditated killer inocent man and here it was again and Jesus said you seek to kill me a man that have told you the truth which I have heard which I have heard of God did just did not Abraham but you do the Deeds of what how could you call religious peoples yay do the Deeds of your father Jesus was actually bringing a separation between the two groups of people right he breaking the separation I'm I'm a God and I'm letting you know where you are where you come from in order for you to have true Revelation you got to know where you come from Hallelujah if you don't know where you come from the devil going to talk you out of it anyway that's why we find so many Christians give up how the first time they hit their face in the mud how I'm out of here I can't do it no when your Christian fall down he got a revelation to stand back up and keep go amen one thing that a Christian don't do is give upen that's right and he says right here then said they to him we be not born of fornication uhoh uhoh yeah we have one father even God that's what I'm say what you get when you don't get scripture Revelation because this what they were bringing to Jesus they had no scripture to support that thought that's right all they had was what somebody said about it oh my H they had no background no Foundation to support that Jesus was born in fornication there is no scripture say that that's right all the scripture we got for his birth Behold a virgin how did they get this scripture how did they get this say it was not scripture like we got a lot of things a scripture today it let come in but if it's not scripture it got no foundation so it's a wrong attribute how here they were they bringing this anization against him they were finding fault with him they were trying to blame him on something that he didn't even have to worry about how can they care he he have to worry about forgiving him for that he never did it in the first place right he was never born that way in the first place so this really didn't mean nothing to him it was just a say he said they said and they said they said to him we not be born of fornication we have one father even God and Jesus said unto them if y were if no if God were your father y would love what because God is attribute of Love hey it was two attributes manifest one was the attribute to murder him and find fault and pray and find blame and mumbl complain against him and the other was if you were the attribute of God you would love me right Hallelujah and then he says here and he said he said he said yeah if they were God you will love me for I proceed for and came from God neither I came of myself but he Des sent me right how do ye not understand my speech I went back to what I was trying to show this morning they did not cuz my sheep hear my voice right excuse me I don't care how religious you are if you can't understand the word or hear his word something wrong with your Revelation right H because if you she you always was God don't you don't become Sheep by rebirth come on so if you was a sheep you always was sheep and any way you understand when she call she understand she why do you not understand my speech because why do you not understand my be even because ye cannot what why because if you could hear the word you only way you can prove that your part of God in the ability to hear the word right right my sheep hear my voice right they did not hear him right they could not understand himly because they didn't know his voice because she don't know sheep a crow don't call her evil because the eagle don't understand gr do he only understand Eagle so now here Eagle talking to a a wolf so wol wouldn't understand sheep right so now he can understand by the ability to hear he know they couldn't understand so now he can EAS bring them to the place and then he can tear the seals off of them and show them who they are oh yeah once he got him to this place if you notice he drove the tag down when he said why do not you understand my speech because my word because you cannot hear my word so now he took it to the plate you cannot get Revelation right if you don't get Revelation you going to be saved right cuz Revelation is fa so now he di once he did this he was able to take the seals and show who they really were he if you notice right here he did not be around the bush once he said this he was ready to expose right the 44th verse he just went on and Expos that's right he showed who they was right here right so now there's no more doubt what they come from right he show what they originated from he show what they he show you what they started and he going to show what they going in there now he said here he said you all of your what father father right the what if you notice he named right he named him right right it was no more presuming right to venture without authority to guess as I'm say he named who they was so now he telling them you of your father the devil and the lust of your father y would do he was a murderer from the beginning and other words he was a murderer from the beginning before he received the name devil he was a murderer he had the name Lucifer H he murdered those angels that called him to believe alive and got them eternally separated right and he cast down to the world and not to the Earth and I called him serpent did his name change for serpent to the devil and did it change in the devil to from the devil to death Hallelujah so he begin to deal with attributes and he says here he's a murder from the beginning he B not in the truth because there is no truth in him right when he speak a lie he speak of his own for he is a lie and the father of Li so he begin to deal with the attribute he begin to deal with that spirit and people what I'm trying to say here that why we got to be conscious of how much we complaining finding fult blaming in other words take it AC as ations and things because it's really it's it's the wrong attribute the only way we only thing that God created open the heart Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord so I can hear you so I can worship you H that's what God want us to do he called us but the Lord he called to live our life not for somebody else for not for our but for somebody else amen I get ready to bring this to a close this evening I told a story a while by it was a boy he was in the service and the friend got shot and when he was in service he was going across the battlefield bars was dropping missiles and smoke and dust was flying all over the place and a car walked out and saw him and he seen this boy carrying this boy across this field Bur can make it and the colonel says to this young man son drop that man and run and save your
