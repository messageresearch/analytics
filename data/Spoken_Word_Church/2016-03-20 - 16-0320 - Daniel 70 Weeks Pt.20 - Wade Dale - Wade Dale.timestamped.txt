[1:09] okay write your name on it that way
[1:19] you'll have it and it'll be oriented
[1:22] correct other few things we need to
[1:23] write on it today first thing you need
[1:26] right on it is right on whatever side
[1:31] you can start on make sure because if
[1:33] you flip it over we're gonna be talking
[1:35] backwards so whatever are you gonna
[1:39] start put rapture and then you we're
[1:46] gonna orient this way okay rapture and
[1:49] going this way so this is going to be
[1:53] the last week to the Jews we're not
[1:56] gonna be here but this is where it's all
[2:00] going to wind up and happen and all
[2:02] okay this is a rapture so the rapture of
[2:05] the Gentile Church actually put rector
[2:08] of brought our Gentile bride because if
[2:11] you don't because right here the Jews
[2:14] take a rapture got it
[2:17] you take a raptor in the middlee so put
[2:21] rapture Gentile church or ever how you
[2:24] want to say bride you can't really say
[2:27] bride but you can't say bride okay
[2:31] because it is the bride using our bride
[2:34] anymore so you can put wrap through the
[2:36] bride if you want to are the catching
[2:39] away yeah and with this chart here if
[2:46] you still got this chart that we had one
[2:48] long long time ago it's right there see
[2:51] where brother Graham talks about unity
[2:53] that's the rapture raptured Saints right
[2:56] there okay that's gonna be us yeah you
[3:00] cut right through but yes you can do
[3:02] that that one identifying you as what's
[3:04] going up yeah my right right so we're
[3:11] gonna deal with this week right here
[3:13] everybody got that this is the week one
[3:15] building right here this is the last
[3:17] week and I think we proved already by
[3:21] the Bible by prophets message that there
[3:24] is one week left after the rapture
[3:28] because remember when we were looking at
[3:30] this chart we see the Gentile rapture
[3:33] the 1260 days the two prophets
[3:36] prophesied and then they take a rapture
[3:39] and there's no way to fulfill the 6-volt
[3:42] purpose in that first three and a half
[3:44] years and go back out that we've covered
[3:47] it and covered and covered it I hope you
[3:48] got that that's right that's the six
[3:51] fold purpose is in the Bible and it must
[3:53] be fulfilled so according to the six
[3:56] fold purpose
[3:58] it must be fulfilled
[4:00] there's got to be somebody here to
[4:02] fulfill it we're not here
[4:05] Buddhist virgins are nine right given a
[4:08] lot for the gospel during this time for
[4:10] the Jews this is their last week can't
[4:14] be last three-and-a-half years
[4:16] Daniel's 70th week everybody got that
[4:19] yes you heard what I said its 70th week
[4:23] there's one week left according to the
[4:27] Bible and the prophets message okay so
[4:31] now what we're going to do is we're
[4:31] going to walk through this week and show
[4:34] a lot of the Bible what's going to take
[4:36] place and I want you to write that down
[4:38] as we go through on your on your paper
[4:41] I'll stop right then before I want you
[4:45] to now what I want you to do is is over
[4:48] here in the very end right where that
[4:52] last mark is right here put year 2026
[5:00] year 2026 right here at the end the 70th
[5:06] week the end of that 70th week but year
[5:10] 2026 and we're going to explain that but
[5:12] I want you to put that there alright and
[5:19] how we get that is is where that brother
[5:24] Branham said in 1977 would be the 70th
[5:28] Jubilee since the beginning of Jubilees
[5:31] according to Leviticus 25 8 now
[5:34] according to Leviticus 25 8 if you'll
[5:36] read your Bible and it's 49 years not 50
[5:42] what do you know all right and we'll
[5:46] cover that butter let me read it to you
[6:05] laughing one left you here
[6:21] let's just wait because what he said in
[6:24] not paragraph 2 15 of the 17 to 13 he
[6:30] talks about 1977 God knows my heart I
[6:33] never noted till yesterday the 1977 is
[6:36] the Jubilee same amount of time right
[6:38] now to give Israel and everything it's a
[6:40] hen okay alright so now turn your paper
[6:47] over on the back and put 7 d + 49 earth
[6:51] set yeah 70 if you believe 70 plus 49
[6:58] all right add that up
[7:09] well put 19 sets already put in 1977
[7:14] plus 49 I'm in 1977 I'm thinking about
[7:22] 10 minutes ahead so let me buy cousin
[7:24] Betty 1977 plus 49 Kohi from brother I'm
[7:30] predicted he didn't prophesy he
[7:32] predicted these things would take place
[7:34] and the 1977 will be the 70th Jubilee
[7:38] okay making for one seventy times seven
[7:41] 490 all right here's where everybody
[7:46] goes haywire they talk to rapture is
[7:47] gonna take place in 77 but that's not
[7:49] like Robert said obviously it's not what
[7:51] he said cutting with Hillary but if you
[7:53] take 1977 and at 49 years because if you
[7:59] add 50 years you're going into the 71st
[8:02] you believe everybody got that 77 was
[8:06] the 70th few bellator how many of you
[8:10] remember how many times that we've
[8:11] looked at this study and laugh over how
[8:16] many times brother Brown talks about a
[8:18] lap oh man in 1970 Lisa's big lap over
[8:23] those Church ages laugh over and he said
[8:25] everything laps over God doesn't it
[8:27] doesn't a brother stop them and then
[8:29] begin something else right he said in
[8:33] the Bible that they go out in 400 years
[8:36] right how many years was it four and
[8:39] thirty God give them 30 years of grace
[8:42] so we've been living under 49 years or
[8:44] close to it now of grace since 1977
[8:48] something did happen in 1977
[8:50] that was the 7s Jubilee the getting
[8:53] ready to go home now it took us since
[8:58] then it took us almost the heck that
[9:01] length of time hey how long 20 26 from
[9:04] now 10 years just 10 years from now
[9:11] would be 2026 now I want to also warn
[9:15] you I'm not set in days I'm just telling
[9:17] you what we're going to do by the
[9:18] prophets message and we're going to plug
[9:20] some numbers in and see how they fit
[9:22] that all right sorry brother I think we
[9:27] might know thee not the day or hour but
[9:29] we couldn't know the ears cry and as the
[9:30] Wayne said and month so we go we might
[9:34] get close okay some 20 20 states and
[9:39] their brother Dale fries tips like I
[9:40] said in 1974 because you got a read from
[9:43] brother Brown said he said it's the 7 if
[9:44] you believe since the beginning of do
[9:46] you believe according Leviticus 25 8 a
[9:48] minute 25 8 is 7 7 is 49 because truly
[9:54] the millennium is the Jubilee to the
[9:58] Jews remember we went through the chart
[10:01] you still gotta go by these few beliefs
[10:03] the times to pass over the unleavened
[10:08] bread keep going trumpets Tabernacles
[10:14] Feast of Pentecost all the seven feasts
[10:16] that we talked about guys I'm gonna go
[10:18] weigh that with them because they're his
[10:19] feast all right and that's why we as
[10:22] Gentiles has been looking at this Daniel
[10:24] 70 weeks through a Gentile life but now
[10:26] since we've begun this study we've been
[10:30] trying to look to the Jewish I three way
[10:33] through a Jewish time we went through
[10:36] the calendar with a little wheel that yo
[10:37] most of these got who a wheel they chose
[10:41] to feast days
[10:42] all right well those feast days won't be
[10:44] done away with those these days to me
[10:46] they're markers they're a marker of time
[10:49] and they're set exactly the way they're
[10:51] supposed to be the lamb was to be killed
[10:54] it Passover right do you think you
[10:57] next day was unleavened bread first
[11:01] route then Pentecost Pentecost comes
[11:05] exactly 50 days after the resurrection
[11:07] whoa
[11:09] that was set two thousand years before
[11:11] Jesus was even on the earth it told you
[11:14] when he was coming back in the people
[11:17] right in the people it was already
[11:19] foretold on the day of Pentecost I want
[11:23] to pour out my spirit in Joel's about
[11:25] four months but it went on for that
[11:26] that's what I've been reading the book
[11:28] of Acts again and that's what Peter said
[11:30] Peter goes straight to Joel Joel says I
[11:33] pour out my spirit upon hopefully young
[11:35] men see dreams on them civilians know
[11:37] that he was in the Bible we just had not
[11:41] have her eyes opened enough to be able
[11:43] to see that and then we had a prophet
[11:47] come along and he explained it like I
[11:49] said before he caught all the loose ends
[11:51] together and put everything back
[11:52] together and that's who we're you know
[11:55] what some of you are watching some of
[11:56] that tub on the internet which is really
[11:59] good but they they have their they have
[12:01] their loose ends they have their loose
[12:05] ends but they do have tribute because
[12:07] what they're doing is very explaining
[12:09] you finally the way I understand it
[12:12] they're explaining it by that Jewish
[12:13] calendar and that's what the 70 ways
[12:16] that's the problem we've always had
[12:17] we've never looked at it as a Jewish
[12:19] time and we're just trying to plug in
[12:24] with brother and said yeah well his
[12:28] brother around and said we can see we're
[12:30] going to see later on that there was two
[12:32] or three schools of thoughts come out of
[12:34] the same book and most people in the
[12:37] message don't even read this book they
[12:40] said he made so many mistakes so they
[12:42] just don't read this book they just take
[12:44] what he said in 1963 well that's just
[12:46] compensable in the morning yeah it's
[12:49] just it's just horrible they took this
[12:52] message and broken into pieces yeah so
[12:55] but they're it's true but you have to
[12:58] look see I start on the front what that
[13:01] mean what that means Jewish so this is a
[13:06] Jewish
[13:08] book but the Gentile prophet remember
[13:11] had to bring the message because there's
[13:14] not a Jewish prophet only at this town
[13:16] they will be once that Jewish probably
[13:19] going to do what do you think they're
[13:20] gonna do over there then up him P
[13:22] prophets and I'm gonna go to Israel go
[13:24] went out that for a lot that he was
[13:27] wrong here but name this blue come
[13:29] straight please if you like she ever
[13:33] straight to lie down did John ever
[13:35] straight the last year the light brown
[13:37] the brother brown straighten out John
[13:39] the Baptist another he came to restore
[13:43] it's a restoration message so I promise
[13:46] you the fifth coming of lives is not
[13:48] going to get over there and go well now
[13:49] that probably missed it right here and
[13:51] he missed it here they won't believe him
[13:53] they'll have it right just like we have
[13:56] it right now okay so take your room
[14:00] thank you paper ditch paper but I tell
[14:07] them to do is make sure that you when
[14:09] you start one place make sure you put
[14:11] rapture of the church or rapture of the
[14:14] bride because remember now
[14:16] what's your terminology the church the
[14:19] nominal Church does not go through does
[14:22] not go interaction if I got that Baptist
[14:26] Methodist Pentecostal randomized that
[14:28] are in justification sanctification do
[14:32] not want a rapture right here that's
[14:34] where their food the devil's food them
[14:38] thinking that if they don't go in the
[14:39] rapture here but they're gonna go in the
[14:41] rapture over here they miss it
[14:43] completely remember they the Left Behind
[14:45] series there's a one rapture and then
[14:48] they get saved and there's another
[14:50] coming you know no no and there's not
[14:53] seven years of tribulation either okay
[14:57] only serve it's what we see now we're
[15:00] going to go through it real slow and
[15:01] I'll show you according to the Bible
[15:02] we'll see what what the Bible says about
[15:05] but make sure you mark one place and put
[15:08] rapture of bride our rapture of us as
[15:12] Regina Sam or Gentile rapture
[15:15] it's not a Jewish rapture now you can
[15:17] write right here you can write rapture
[15:20] of 144,000 don't put Jews rapture comes
[15:24] and I love Jews
[15:25] it's rapture of 144,000 because what are
[15:30] they gonna do they can prophesy twelve
[15:31] hundred and sixty days so this is the
[15:35] rapture right here all right
[15:37] then right here on this side put 2026
[15:41] that's what we've been talking about
[15:43] that's 1977 plus 49 because if you put
[15:48] 77 plus 50 that's why I'm telling you
[15:51] we're going to try and get this thing
[15:52] down where we know one thing for sure
[15:55] we're going to know when the 70th week
[15:59] ends and all we got to do is back it up
[16:02] seven years all we gotta do is back it
[16:09] up seven years and we'll know when our
[16:12] rectory will say because if we if we
[16:23] have a mark
[16:25] we know that seventy weeks of Daniel
[16:28] begins 445 BC alright we've been over
[16:34] and over and over it
[16:36] 445 BC is when it begins there has to be
[16:39] an ending date somewhere okay there's
[16:43] been an ending date the date that it
[16:45] ends because seventy weeks are
[16:48] determined 490 years is all they're
[16:52] gonna get okay yeah now let's go back
[16:57] and talk about the lap over remember
[16:59] there's a lamp over you say well where's
[17:02] the lamp over over here God's calling
[17:04] Israel and a nice right man good job
[17:08] he's getting them ready put him back in
[17:10] the homeland and win 1947 48 47 right
[17:16] keep it on you charge did they fried the
[17:18] ground Ruth
[17:19] he put even you know tightest Jesus
[17:22] would kill maybe 30 times coming 80 70
[17:24] well that it was over in the church ages
[17:26] God was still dealing with
[17:28] a little bit but after finally in eighty
[17:29] seventy then cut off because the
[17:34] scripture says it right all right so now
[17:37] right here brother Brandon being the
[17:38] Prophet knows not to start that you
[17:41] don't start to 70th week but the lap
[17:47] over time God is beginning to deal with
[17:50] you and me and the Jeebs getting back in
[17:52] the homeland so you know you can put
[17:54] 1947 or 48 right there cuz right here
[17:57] Jews returning this is what brother
[17:59] Brown degree right here
[18:00] Jews returning right here so you can put
[18:04] in 1948 49 right left so God's dealing
[18:07] you say is he dealing with him he's got
[18:09] to get him in her homeland before he can
[18:11] even deal with all right yes
[18:13] gotta get him in the homeland before he
[18:15] can deal with so that's when that
[18:19] raptures gonna take place though the
[18:21] Gentile church is going up right Joel
[18:25] she'll have these if you don't want
[18:29] really like I said before rapture name
[18:31] on them that way of taking when they're
[18:33] not upside down this way and put them
[18:36] over in that corner and keep them I'll
[18:39] try to keep mom from throwing them away
[18:42] cleaning them up don't actually just
[18:46] leave them over there and how I'm in a
[18:47] climbing cabinet somewhere that way I
[18:49] make sure thank you
[18:57] I just will they run all out first you
[18:59] know
[19:20] Yankee boys never never took a
[19:23] handkerchief with them they always wore
[19:25] the thing around their neck they had one
[19:26] blow over totally so they just let her
[19:28] go out to them cactus so anyway that's
[19:35] right that's right so anyway we haven't
[19:39] learned at least one thing wanna kevanna
[19:41] again
[19:44] can we get my go-to subject now so take
[19:50] this give-give Josephine but I want you
[20:01] to keep up with this and remember it's
[20:03] horizontal so we're gonna start filling
[20:05] this in from the rapture of the Gentile
[20:07] Church okay
[20:10] but right 2026 here because we got a
[20:12] backup seven years and start the 70th
[20:15] week then all right
[20:18] if 1977 brother Brown since 1977 was was
[20:23] the 70th Jubilee since the beginning of
[20:26] what is seventy seventy times seven 490
[20:30] all right okay so God's giving us 49
[20:34] years of grace but he is going to stop
[20:37] it one day especially this time all
[20:40] right but watch remember now if you go
[20:44] one more year you broke everything you
[20:47] went into your 71st Jubilee there's only
[20:52] seven sevens that was for nothing
[20:54] you got it so what's gonna happen is
[20:56] it's sure there's still time gonna go on
[20:59] in the Millennium but that 70th Jubilee
[21:01] I believe in 1977 like Roosevelt said
[21:04] God came down and started revealing
[21:07] himself to the Gentiles
[21:10] to the Jews impartial here's that one
[21:14] saying they're not gonna get their
[21:15] opponents till the two province at the
[21:16] ground but listen the new prophets have
[21:19] to be right here now even if you go past
[21:24] 2026 they've got to be able mature they
[21:26] ain't going to twelve your old Jew boy
[21:28] runs well don't hang that with Zhu Tao
[21:30] there's not gonna walk out though I
[21:32] start believing us it's gonna be on a
[21:35] tour person so that those two people are
[21:37] on the earth now God's got to be dealing
[21:40] with them you say well how do we know it
[21:42] really doesn't matter does they're
[21:44] nothing to us nothing they cannot start
[21:48] it though if I was them I'd be over here
[21:50] they have a church-going lazy bunch of
[21:52] people okay get out of the way cuz we
[21:57] got to get out of the way let's go back
[21:59] and come on this thing
[22:00] we're the only thing holding up the Jews
[22:03] take the rapture but remember you still
[22:06] got to look at these days it's alright
[22:08] 2026 over here and then we're going to
[22:10] back up and start you see what the Lord
[22:14] has for us like I said before it do not
[22:17] say I'm setting a date I'm not but I'm
[22:20] just throwing it out there so that we
[22:21] can see that it is closer they would
[22:24] think yes it is closer than we think
[22:26] okay and we'll look at it truly then now
[22:30] because 2026 means something even in the
[22:33] Jewish calendar 2026 means a lot it's
[22:36] been brought up a lot if you watch on
[22:37] the internet that Kingdom seven kingdoms
[22:39] son seven seven seven he does a real
[22:42] good job bringing that out so we'll look
[22:46] at it and what we'll do is we'll take
[22:48] just one brother brown brother Brown
[22:49] took what your eyes Smith Clarence
[22:51] Larkin he read all those people hey he's
[22:55] not the first one to come up with the
[22:56] Alpha knee Scofield in 1900 put it in
[23:01] his Bible that is Kaneesha theophany
[23:04] okay and aloe goddess and all that so we
[23:06] see that but remember he was trying to
[23:08] tarry class Marvin was Trent area your
[23:11] eyes met with Trinitarian they had their
[23:14] problems but it's got to come to a
[23:16] purity of the message where we brother
[23:18] Adam ties those loose ends back together
[23:20] and then it makes that beaut
[23:22] picture yeah I am so now let's go to
[23:25] revelations 11 and the first thing we're
[23:29] gonna write on our paper is ad right
[23:30] here in just second
[23:31] this is revelations 11 that was given to
[23:34] me a reed like into a rod and the angel
[23:38] stood saying rise and measure the temple
[23:40] of God now I got to finish early so I
[23:42] can go strap William up so don't let me
[23:44] go past about 20 after rise and measure
[23:47] the temple of God and the altar and them
[23:50] that worship therein but the court which
[23:53] is without the temple leave out and
[23:55] measure it not for it is given unto the
[23:57] Gentiles and the Holy City shall they
[23:59] tread under foot forty two months
[24:04] what forty two times thirty twelve
[24:10] hundred and sixty half of seven three
[24:16] and a half years okay so he's fixin to
[24:18] tell us something here what 42 months 42
[24:21] times thirty don't make me look a little
[24:24] ones down one's own bill there's only 30
[24:27] day months in Jewish calendar 42 months
[24:31] times 30 is what twelve hundred and
[24:34] sixty days before some temple drop what
[24:36] and I will give power unto my two
[24:39] witnesses and they shall prophesy a
[24:41] thousand two hundred and sixty days he
[24:43] just explained what he was talking about
[24:46] alright clothed in sackcloth these are
[24:49] the two olive trees and the two
[24:50] candlesticks standing before the god of
[24:52] the earth if any man will hurt them fire
[24:54] proceedeth out of their mouth and
[24:56] devoureth their enemy and female worth
[24:58] him he must be in he must in this manner
[25:00] be killed so write on your first part
[25:04] right here from the right to the church
[25:07] put 1260 days two prophets all right
[25:16] okay so I'm going 60 days to prophets
[25:20] prophesy 1260 day or what 42 months 42
[25:26] Jewish months got it okay now got it
[25:36] these have power to shut heaven that it
[25:39] rain not in the days of the prophecy
[25:40] none who shut who shut them for how long
[25:46] thank you
[25:47] he's already done it one time these
[25:50] things he'll do it again so it's got to
[25:53] be the spirit of Elijah on somebody and
[25:55] we know for a fact that the Jews say the
[25:57] Jews read Malachi 4 and they say before
[26:01] the great congrat from dead Lord I'm
[26:02] gonna send you Elijah the Prophet they
[26:04] know what lies has got to come before
[26:06] the Messiah comes they just missed that
[26:08] one and they're thinking he's the one
[26:12] that's why they set that cup of the line
[26:13] shut down every time they have their
[26:15] their meal they are not never come to
[26:18] have the meal with and they have the
[26:19] Passover whatever the end of their time
[26:21] their last feast is they said to cut
[26:24] down take a look out the door they look
[26:26] this way look this way
[26:27] they look for Elijah because they know
[26:29] he's gotta come walking into Jerusalem
[26:31] they go back and they put the cup up and
[26:33] say until next year or whatever that
[26:35] isn't in their Jewish language until
[26:38] next year so they know one thing for
[26:40] sure he'll I just got come and they read
[26:42] the Old Testament so if this from this
[26:44] this spirit of Elijah comes on a man and
[26:48] he says they won't rain for three and a
[26:49] half years until I called for it they
[26:51] don't know one thing's for sure he's got
[26:53] the spirit of Elijah he's just like the
[26:55] one in the Old Testament okay because
[26:57] remember the Jews are not reading New
[26:59] Testament they're in Old Testament those
[27:01] two prophets are going to be just like
[27:03] Paul's they're gonna bring that Old
[27:04] Testament alive to those Jews okay cuz
[27:09] remember the Jews don't believe Jesus
[27:11] was on the side right they're gonna have
[27:14] to teach 144,000 that Jesus was the
[27:17] Messiah and have power over waters to
[27:20] turn them to blood and everybody said
[27:22] well okay that was they think well inna
[27:24] know who turn the water to blood holds
[27:27] in that slip the card holding our River
[27:29] into blood so when that happens they're
[27:31] gonna go Moses's back most of their
[27:36] lives
[27:37] alright and smite the earth with all
[27:40] plagues as often as they will
[27:42] all they gotta do is one speaking and
[27:45] eleven then when they shall have
[27:48] finished their testimony the Beast that
[27:50] ascends it out of the bottomless pit
[27:51] shall make war against them and shall
[27:53] overcome them and kill them okay
[27:58] somewhere in here is what we're looking
[28:00] at this is a trap for the hundred
[28:01] forty-four thousand because they're
[28:03] gonna be killed what their prophecy is
[28:06] over their prophecies over right here
[28:10] right here the prophecies done right and
[28:15] their dead bodies shall lie in the
[28:17] street of the great city which Pierce is
[28:18] called Sodom and Egypt where also our
[28:20] Lord was crucified and they have the
[28:22] people in kindred and tongue of nations
[28:24] shall see their dead bodies through
[28:27] television CNN Fox News all those people
[28:32] they're gonna what see the nations shall
[28:34] see their dead body gotta be peek
[28:36] through photograph video all right three
[28:40] days and a half and shall not suffer
[28:41] their dead bodies to be put into graves
[28:43] why what they're gonna do all they men
[28:45] they rejoice they make merry send gifts
[28:48] one to another because these two
[28:50] prophets tormented them that dwelt from
[28:52] the earth and after three and a half
[28:54] days the spirit alive from God entered
[28:56] into them and they stood up on their
[28:57] feet and great fear fell upon them which
[29:00] saw them and they heard a great voice
[29:02] from heaven saying unto them come up
[29:05] hither now that happened in Revelation
[29:08] 4:1 brother Branham said that's when the
[29:11] rapture of the bride revelations for one
[29:15] bride goes up he says cometh hither
[29:17] all right now he's saying the same thing
[29:19] come up hither and they ascended up to
[29:21] heaven in a cloud and their enemies
[29:23] beheld them then there was a great
[29:25] earthquake tenth part of the city fell
[29:27] and the earthquake was slain of men
[29:29] seven thousand and the remnants were
[29:30] afraid and give glory to God of heaven
[29:33] the second wool was passed behold third
[29:35] woe cometh quickly now what is a third
[29:39] world third world war not the
[29:43] tribulation because while this is going
[29:45] on here is going to be tribulation thank
[29:50] you
[29:51] yeah that's when that's when all that
[29:54] swing well I don't know if that's one
[29:56] Russia bombed us because you gotta have
[30:01] to worry about one thing
[30:03] if one start throwing one bone nose is
[30:05] gonna throw in another one that's gonna
[30:06] happen right here so you can say they
[30:12] they don't bomb I still hear but now
[30:14] once the earthquake happens in in
[30:16] California all the nations are just
[30:18] gonna pile into the United States and
[30:20] take over because because it'll be such
[30:22] a destruction until we've seen hasn't
[30:25] yet you know and that's when Russia
[30:28] could come in and they always want help
[30:31] you know you know how help is you know
[30:34] let us help you but you're going to give
[30:37] us something in return
[30:40] so everybody got that till the third
[30:44] world war it's the third whoa brother
[30:47] Graham said the first well was the first
[30:48] world war ii but what was the second
[30:50] world war
[30:51] third whoa the third world war okay i
[30:59] would say it's gonna be the same people
[31:04] that killed the two witnesses and i
[31:07] would assume i think they'll gather them
[31:08] all together and then hey you know what
[31:13] that spirit knows how to kill and killed
[31:16] 6.8 million jews in just several years
[31:18] really two years there really wasn't the
[31:20] whole war if you don't remember what the
[31:22] whole four years of war at world war two
[31:24] that they will start killing jews and
[31:26] all they just come to develop the idea
[31:29] of putting them in a concentration camp
[31:30] and killing them okay so i believe
[31:33] they'll gather them together and kill
[31:35] them all at one time and then they'll
[31:37] come back to life and going Iraq whether
[31:39] all in one place we can't go anywhere
[31:42] about the Bible the Bible says them the
[31:44] world would be looking at those two
[31:45] witnesses they will kill okay so we can
[31:48] go by that but we're like you know most
[31:51] people say there's no there is no
[31:53] scripture that says 144,000 is gonna die
[31:56] or be killed going after but we know one
[31:59] thing's for sure they're not gonna be
[32:00] hearing about
[32:02] so you have to it's like Willy was
[32:05] talking about last night you got to read
[32:06] between the lines
[32:07] you got to know what the property gives
[32:09] us know what the Bible says and have the
[32:12] Holy Ghost to know how to Marion that
[32:14] all together that's my whole point with
[32:17] Daniel's telling you week we took we
[32:19] took this over here and we've took this
[32:21] over here and we've took this here they
[32:24] never know hardly anybody ever been able
[32:26] to marry all those together I mean Mary
[32:28] I mean make them fit together and and I
[32:32] think we're get close to doing that now
[32:34] you know we we preach Daniel 70 weeks
[32:37] just out of a lot of quotes and some
[32:40] dates but I think that we we missed a
[32:43] lot by not looking at it through a
[32:44] Jewish eye we have to look at it through
[32:49] a Jewish child colors to a Jewish people
[32:50] and it is to the Jews so this is a
[32:53] Jewish happening but if Israel is God's
[32:58] timepiece people watch brother Brown
[33:00] telling us he said watch Israel there
[33:03] the timepiece well what's the timepiece
[33:06] timepiece tells you when to go when to
[33:08] come when to leave when the total worry
[33:10] comes easy yes
[33:12] okay it's getting late let's look at the
[33:15] clock and see what time and hit well
[33:18] it's getting late let's look at the
[33:19] timepiece and see how close we are
[33:23] hey I got them so we got 1260 days now
[33:28] during this time let's read one thing
[33:30] before we go let's go - you don't have
[33:33] to go to Jeremiah cuz you're gonna hear
[33:36] this Jeremiah 30 everybody's heard of
[33:41] Jacob's trouble alright so here we go
[33:45] this is Jacob's trouble this is where
[33:48] the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah
[33:50] from the Lord saying the word of the
[33:53] Lord that came to Jeremiah from the Lord
[33:55] saying the speaketh the Lord God of
[33:57] Israel saying write the all the words
[34:00] that I've spoken unto thee in a book for
[34:04] lo the day come said the Lord that I
[34:06] will bring again the captivity of my
[34:10] people Israel and you
[34:11] that said Lord and I will cause them to
[34:14] return to the land that I give her the
[34:15] father's and they shall that's it no
[34:17] when is that that's now that's now right
[34:21] now this is this day this scripture for
[34:24] Bill are in 1948 or 49 and it's moved up
[34:27] closer and closer because all the Jews
[34:29] now that telling them if you have a
[34:30] Jewish origin back from like 50
[34:32] generations they'll give you free
[34:34] citizenship you clion and boom you're
[34:36] old you're automatically you are a
[34:38] citizen of Israel as you put it that way
[34:40] and these are the words that the Lord
[34:42] spake concerning Israel and concerning
[34:45] Judah for thus said the Lord we have
[34:46] heard a voice of trembling of fear and
[34:48] not of peace because remember this 1260
[34:51] days that these new prophets calling the
[34:53] earth there's nothing to be hardly any
[34:55] peace anywhere okay that's why I'm
[34:59] saying the Bible says peace peace then
[35:00] sudden destruction that peace peace has
[35:02] got to be real close right in here when
[35:04] we leave there's got to be somebody to
[35:07] bring peace before this can be some
[35:08] destruction asking now and see whether
[35:11] Amanda travail with child wherefore do I
[35:14] see every man with his hands on his
[35:15] loins as a woman in travail and all
[35:17] faces are turned into paleness alas for
[35:21] that day is great so that none is like
[35:23] it it is even the time of death of
[35:26] trouble but he shall be saved out of it
[35:29] who was getting up do ya ready go
[35:32] Jacob was a Jew he's going to be taken
[35:36] out of the first come to pass in that
[35:37] day saith the Lord of Hosts I will break
[35:39] his yoke from off my name and will burst
[35:41] out bonds and strangers you're no more
[35:44] served themselves of him if they shall
[35:47] serve what the Lord their God and David
[35:48] their King son of David this is showing
[35:52] you it's going into the Millennium son
[35:54] of David Jesus Christ not just talking
[35:58] about David David what's their literal
[36:00] King but they're there I mean their
[36:02] earthly King but their literal kings
[36:04] Jesus Christ
[36:05] typing David saying that the son of
[36:08] David was selling from right right
[36:10] here's where tell you and David their
[36:11] King who I will raise up unto them all
[36:15] right would you choose
[36:17] therefore fear and Valentine o my
[36:20] servant Jacob said the Lord neither be
[36:22] dismayed old Israel for lo I will save
[36:24] thee from afar and thy seed from the
[36:27] land of their captivity and Jacob shall
[36:29] return and show me what rest
[36:30] what is the millennium rest he's telling
[36:35] them right here what's going to happen
[36:36] and she'll be in rest and be quiet and
[36:39] none shall make him afraid there's you
[36:42] millennium right there let's stop right
[36:44] there but we'll begin again see he says
[36:46] go make full and of all nations Drive
[36:50] scattered thee destroyed gone there's
[36:52] not going to be a nation on this earth
[36:54] in the millennium except the bride and
[36:57] 144,000 the nation of Israel there is
[37:00] not going to be a United States and a
[37:02] Russian on the China and among all
[37:04] nations whether I have scattered these
[37:08] bringing them back yeah well I'll not
[37:11] make a full end of these nothing to end
[37:13] them but I will correct thee in the
[37:17] Millennium the Jews are going to get
[37:20] their correction remember a lot of
[37:24] people will died under bulls and goats a
[37:25] lot of people died under things that
[37:27] were not exactly 100 percent true in the
[37:30] Millennium we're gonna be able to show
[37:32] them they didn't need to kill the goat
[37:34] they didn't need to kill around that the
[37:36] Lamb of God died and the temple is the
[37:40] person that's standing there not the
[37:42] literal building okay let's go
[37:46] Daniel next Sunday we're gonna be gone
[37:49] so I'm not sure
