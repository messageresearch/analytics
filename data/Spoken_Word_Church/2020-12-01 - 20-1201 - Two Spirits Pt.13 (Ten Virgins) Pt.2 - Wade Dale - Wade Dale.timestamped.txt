[4:38] turn to
[4:40] first john four we're going to get into
[4:41] the two spirits this will be part two
[4:44] be part 13 10 virgins part two since we
[4:47] didn't get into the 10 virgins
[4:49] last tuesday night so uh remember the
[4:52] announcements that
[4:54] that terrence's give us just go over one
[4:56] more time december the 6th
[4:58] which will be this coming sunday brother
[5:00] luis will be speaking
[5:02] dad and i'll be in kentucky i call
[5:04] brother richard hyatt yesterday
[5:05] his wife has coveted so he'll be sitting
[5:08] at home with her
[5:09] and he said that's just the way the lord
[5:11] works it out he said i'd had to find
[5:12] somebody to preach for me and he said i
[5:14] already scheduled you
[5:15] so so it's good that we could be able to
[5:18] help him but i told him we would pray
[5:19] for his wife
[5:21] brother richard hyatt's wife she is was
[5:23] tested positive yesterday for the virus
[5:27] and most of his church he says already
[5:28] had it so i think we're okay
[5:30] we're okay anyway i'm not not going so
[5:33] decent
[5:34] and december the 9th which will be on
[5:37] the wednesday that we're starting back
[5:39] brother aaron will be speaking for us
[5:41] and then that'll be on the 13th and
[5:43] that'll be the christmas dinner that
[5:44] kind of gets us all back in line
[5:47] then december the 31st brother william
[5:49] bourdon will be
[5:50] here for our
[5:53] ever how many 50 something annual watch
[5:56] night service and we never had not had
[5:58] one heaven
[5:59] since 1971 never never not had one
[6:02] so we thank god for that that it's a
[6:04] long running tradition that
[6:06] works out really well and then
[6:09] the world can party all they want to but
[6:12] they can't
[6:13] they can't string together a group of
[6:15] spiritual people like we can
[6:17] and bring them together on that night to
[6:19] bring in a new year and now like i said
[6:21] wednesday i'm looking forward to this
[6:23] year satan has just beat us up
[6:26] in the flesh i just got back from the
[6:28] doctor today i'm having a psa test again
[6:30] just pray that that thing will go back
[6:31] down
[6:32] so we won't have to do anything further
[6:35] and i got a cortisone shot in my
[6:36] shoulder and
[6:38] give blood and i don't know what else
[6:41] going on so
[6:42] this i'll be 61 in a few months
[6:45] in a few months so that's all right
[6:48] but devil can beat all he wants to i
[6:50] just go back to job you can sit there
[6:51] and watch job
[6:54] job was he was an upright man
[6:58] and god brought the attention of job
[7:01] being an upright man to the devil and
[7:03] the devil first thing he said you've got
[7:05] a hedge built around him he said
[7:06] okay touch his body but you can't touch
[7:08] his life
[7:10] so he took everything away from him
[7:11] except his salvation
[7:14] and that's what held job to be the
[7:16] salvation of that time
[7:18] not like the salvation of our time but
[7:20] the salvation of his time
[7:21] job was a righteous man because he did
[7:23] what the word said
[7:24] amen that's what i've been thinking
[7:26] today too with these two spirits the
[7:28] difference in these two spirits is
[7:30] is one is a hundred percent on the word
[7:32] and the other is 99.
[7:35] just one percent off and that's what
[7:38] we're going to talk about tonight so 10
[7:39] virgins part
[7:41] two but it'll be part 13 or two spirits
[7:43] so all mine's clear i know we all have
[7:46] family members and uh i just there was a
[7:48] text coming in from brother
[7:50] sister carnes about ray montgomery
[7:53] someone said he was doing
[7:54] worse but the problem was is the balloon
[7:57] and the ventilator
[7:58] broke so it made everything go haywire
[8:00] like he was
[8:01] almost dying but it's not when they put
[8:04] the new ventilator back on the new
[8:06] ventilator bulb back on his blood
[8:07] pressure went back
[8:08] up and his oxygen went up some
[8:12] and they got him on his back so we're
[8:14] just going to pray that
[8:15] the devil tried to do what he could do
[8:16] and send out false information but
[8:19] but when the doctors came in and put
[8:20] that new vent back on there
[8:22] it came back up they thought he had a um
[8:25] yes a man
[8:27] they thought he had a bleed in his brain
[8:29] did a brain scan
[8:30] perfect they said and they thought he
[8:32] had a collapsed lung so they did a lot
[8:34] they did there were several tests on the
[8:37] come in on facebook there were several
[8:38] tests that they had run and so
[8:40] everything's fine so we're just going to
[8:41] believe and keep believing positive
[8:44] that the devil can do what he wants to
[8:46] uh we had
[8:47] and communication is bad just pray for
[8:49] those nurses and ones because
[8:51] because you know dad even had gave that
[8:53] we got false information
[8:54] from from a person up there in the
[8:56] hospital and
[8:57] and you're only getting what you hear
[9:00] you don't get to personally talk to a
[9:01] doctor so and sister rita sitting at
[9:03] home you know she's got covid so she's
[9:05] doing better
[9:06] but she was able to talk to brother ray
[9:08] for a little while the other day and she
[9:09] was reading him scripture and reading
[9:10] him some of the prophet's message
[9:12] so just keep doing and we just keep
[9:14] praying to me that's the best formula
[9:17] amen just have positive attitude keep
[9:19] praying read the bible
[9:21] and just believe that god's already done
[9:24] it amen so let's bow our heads dear
[9:25] emily father thank you lord
[9:28] for getting us here today lord we've
[9:31] through many dangers talls and snares as
[9:33] this
[9:34] song says lord satan would love to just
[9:38] destroy every one of us in this building
[9:39] at the moment but lord your protective
[9:41] hand is upon each one
[9:44] and father we pray that you would just
[9:45] be with us now in the furtherment of
[9:46] this service that your
[9:48] protective hand will now as we are
[9:51] seating here today in heavenly places as
[9:53] the bible says
[9:54] that we'll hear from you father and not
[9:56] hear from just a man
[9:58] but we'll hear directly from you lord
[10:00] through the reading of the scripture and
[10:01] the quoting and the different things
[10:03] lord may we
[10:04] receive revelation and lord may it
[10:07] take us through tomorrow the next day
[10:08] and lord until you come
[10:11] father this is a self-sustaining
[10:14] word it absolutely will sustain you
[10:18] through any
[10:19] problem that anyone has and ever has had
[10:22] because you said it there
[10:24] for us to have it already so thank you
[10:26] for that father we ask you to bless now
[10:28] and the furthermore service be with us
[10:29] as we travel starting tomorrow
[10:31] going for a little time of rest and
[10:32] relaxation beaver brother richard
[10:34] hyatt's wife lord we pray that you touch
[10:36] her lord
[10:36] with this virus lord it would just go
[10:39] away real quick
[10:40] and you'll be back in service for you
[10:42] father we ask these things in jesus name
[10:45] amen brother richard was telling me
[10:46] there was a brother mead i'd never heard
[10:48] of him before but
[10:50] uh he'd be in the message a long time he
[10:52] he succumbed to the
[10:54] to the virus a couple days ago and just
[10:57] keep the family in your prayers so
[10:58] trying times but you know what it's okay
[11:00] we're all right
[11:02] we're good first john 4 verse 1
[11:06] beloved believe not every spirit but try
[11:09] the spirits whether they are of god
[11:10] because many false prophets are going
[11:12] out into the world
[11:14] hereby know you the spirit of god every
[11:15] spirit that confesses that jesus christ
[11:17] has come in the flesh is of god
[11:19] and every spirit that confesses not that
[11:21] jesus christ has come in the flesh is
[11:22] not of god
[11:24] and this is that spirit of antichrist
[11:26] where we have heard that it should come
[11:28] and even now now already is in the world
[11:30] so it's been in the world now since
[11:32] whatever this is 1896 when john's
[11:35] pinning this so it's been here a while
[11:38] all right and it's not an infant anymore
[11:41] it's a full-grown man you are of god
[11:44] little children and have overcome them
[11:47] because greater is he that's in you than
[11:50] he that's in the world we could go home
[11:52] and just believe that that'd be a good
[11:53] good place to stop they are of the world
[11:56] therefore speak they of the world and
[11:57] the world heareth them we are of god
[11:59] he that knoweth god heareth us he that
[12:01] is not of god here's not us
[12:03] hereby know we the spirit this is the
[12:06] question now hereby
[12:08] hereby we know the spirit of truth
[12:11] and the spirit of error now let's read
[12:12] matthew 25
[12:15] it says then shall the kingdom of heaven
[12:16] be likened unto ten virgins
[12:19] we took their lamps and went forth to
[12:20] meet the bridegroom
[12:22] and five of them were wise and five of
[12:24] them were foolish
[12:25] they that were foolish took their lamps
[12:27] and took no oil with them
[12:28] but the wives took oil in their vessels
[12:31] with their lamps and we'll get to that
[12:33] in just a little bit the lord adds a
[12:34] blessing to the reading of the word you
[12:35] may be seated
[12:37] unless we get our let's read the two
[12:38] quotes that we've been reading before
[12:41] in the exposition of the church agency
[12:43] now remember this christ in the true
[12:45] church
[12:46] is a continuation of the book of acts
[12:47] now what what i've been thinking about
[12:49] this
[12:49] during this this week the whole time
[12:51] during the week we got to know listen
[12:54] as brother dale was telling us sunday
[12:57] these little markers and these little
[12:58] prophecies and these things that we have
[13:00] seen come to pass
[13:02] we know that now six of them has come to
[13:05] pass
[13:06] we're not gonna be here for number seven
[13:07] so where are we at
[13:11] we're in that catching away or we're in
[13:13] that interval time that overlap between
[13:16] this and destruction so when we look at
[13:19] this it says christ in the true church
[13:23] where's the true church you've got to
[13:25] decide where that true church is
[13:28] you've got to know where that true
[13:29] church is because we can't be
[13:31] wishy-washy and say well
[13:33] i'll take part of what wesley in and
[13:35] part of what luther and
[13:36] and then i'll just you know i i was
[13:39] talking to somebody the other day and
[13:43] it sounds just like the virgins you know
[13:45] because they try to live the best they
[13:47] can
[13:48] when you talk to a real good a nominal
[13:51] christian that really tries to live the
[13:53] best they can
[13:54] but folks they're so far off it's it's
[13:56] horrible
[13:58] the only word they have is what the
[14:00] preachers told them and what mamas told
[14:02] them and i was talking to somebody just
[14:03] a little bit ago and it's
[14:04] and you kind of roll your eyes because
[14:06] you know you know grandma's the one who
[14:07] said that
[14:08] it wasn't their revelation it's what
[14:10] grandma said so they just carried it
[14:12] right on down to the next generation and
[14:13] the next generation
[14:15] so the only thing we should be carrying
[14:18] down is is where that true church
[14:20] was right and where that true church is
[14:24] because it says the true church is a
[14:27] continuation of the book of acts the
[14:29] false church
[14:30] will look like it to a degree but it
[14:32] will not continue on
[14:34] all right now if eve would have
[14:36] continued on in what god told her
[14:39] she would have produced what god told
[14:42] her to produce but she didn't she
[14:44] stopped just like interjecting a
[14:47] revelation that's not true
[14:49] because the true church is a
[14:50] continuation of the book of acts
[14:52] but the book of revelation shows how
[14:54] that the antichrist spirit would come
[14:55] into the church
[14:56] and defile it now why it's going to try
[14:59] to get in the true church but it's going
[15:00] to get in church somewhere
[15:04] and the true church in antioch look at
[15:07] that powerful group in ephesus it wasn't
[15:09] a church of 6 or 800 people
[15:11] it was 12. but they were all full of the
[15:14] holy ghost they all had the book of acts
[15:15] working or the acts of the holy ghost
[15:17] working in their life
[15:19] when they came to church they didn't
[15:21] have to preach salvation
[15:23] unless they had visitors but what did
[15:26] they do they preached the meat of the
[15:27] word they let they let paul
[15:29] and peter and the different ones give
[15:31] them the meat of the word and there's
[15:33] that unsung hero i was telling you about
[15:35] what happened to those 12 they had to go
[15:37] out and tell
[15:37] oh so there had to be
[15:41] a true line of a true church line
[15:44] l-i-n-e not lying l-i-n-e a true line
[15:47] because that's what we're working with
[15:49] now
[15:50] is what started back there see i just
[15:53] have to believe
[15:55] you should have to believe that if it
[15:58] started back there
[16:00] and it was a true church whatever
[16:03] happens between the 2000 years of
[16:05] church theology there's got to be a true
[16:09] church
[16:09] today just as true as that church
[16:12] but the thing we have that they don't
[16:14] have they didn't have the open book you
[16:16] and i have the open book
[16:19] you and i have the seven seals you and i
[16:21] have the revelations that we can
[16:23] that we can actually tell paul
[16:28] we can tell paul paul i know you saw
[16:30] this
[16:32] but this is what the reality of it is
[16:34] amen
[16:35] same way with peter and all the
[16:36] different ones like brother there was
[16:37] talking about jose and the different
[16:39] ones you know charis johnson in the
[16:40] streets
[16:41] you walk up to him one day and said hey
[16:42] buddy
[16:44] i drove one of them things that you
[16:48] i was one of them jostlers because while
[16:51] we've come to the place to wear what
[16:53] it's not a it's not a prophecy anymore
[16:56] that thing has become a true church
[16:59] there is a true church in this world
[17:01] somewhere
[17:03] we look at all the faults and sometimes
[17:04] we harp on all the faults but there is a
[17:06] true church
[17:09] gotta be it may be very small in
[17:12] minority it may be just scattered here
[17:14] and there but there is a true church
[17:16] because the prophet of god told us but
[17:17] watch we should not let this happen
[17:20] though
[17:20] let the antichrist spirit come into the
[17:23] church defile it make it lukewarm formal
[17:25] and powerless look at all these brothers
[17:28] that are leaving the message
[17:31] now you can be deceived for a while
[17:34] but let's get this clear one thing's for
[17:36] sure you start degrading the message of
[17:38] the hour and the prophet
[17:41] time after time after time and saying
[17:43] it's false you don't have the holy ghost
[17:45] right
[17:46] now i'm just sorry and then peop
[17:49] those people preached 40 years saying
[17:52] they had the holy ghost
[17:55] what did they do they talked to their
[17:56] people how to get it but now if they
[17:58] didn't have it
[18:01] and brother brown said you don't get
[18:03] higher than your pastor
[18:06] then what did he do he preached a
[18:08] foolish virgin doctrine to him
[18:11] and he just brought a bunch of foolish
[18:12] virgins
[18:14] now that's not to say that brother
[18:15] donnie didn't hear was sitting in one of
[18:18] those churches and he heard a
[18:19] true revelation of salvation
[18:22] or of the three works of grace or that
[18:25] or god did send a prophet
[18:26] he could get born again from that but he
[18:28] wouldn't stay in that
[18:30] when that guy looks at them and says
[18:31] this person's faults and we need to take
[18:33] all these pictures down and
[18:34] and he was a liar here and he's a liar
[18:36] there
[18:38] if you got the true holy ghost you'll
[18:40] leave
[18:42] because you won't be leaving it'll be
[18:44] the holy ghost is what's leaving
[18:45] amen you're just going to go with him
[18:48] all right
[18:48] so that's where you're true in your
[18:50] false church and we're talking about the
[18:51] wise and the foolish virgin but we'll
[18:53] get to that
[18:53] but look making it lukewarm formal and
[18:55] powerless now look the true church
[18:59] can't be that we may look like it
[19:03] we may look wore out we may have our
[19:05] feathers all knocked off
[19:08] but thank god an eagle and when he gets
[19:10] all his feathers knocked off he grows
[19:11] some new ones
[19:13] when his beak starts cracking and he
[19:15] starts doing that molting stage and he
[19:17] can't see
[19:18] he might get his little eagle eye
[19:20] skimmed over but you know what will
[19:21] happen
[19:21] another eagle will come along and you
[19:23] know what they'll do they'll
[19:25] they'll peck that scale it may not feel
[19:28] good brother louise when that brother's
[19:30] pecking on you
[19:32] but he's pecking you to help you and
[19:34] when them scales fall off
[19:36] there you are fresh new eagle again so
[19:39] that's what we're looking at what i mean
[19:40] about the truth
[19:41] there is a true church folks don't look
[19:43] around and say well i see all this false
[19:46] let's start looking for the truth let's
[19:49] start looking at the truth
[19:52] i know we've got a warning brother dale
[19:54] warns us the law many many times about
[19:56] all these different doctrines and all
[19:57] that is what we need to be warned but we
[19:59] also don't need to stay there we don't
[20:02] but i'm telling you
[20:03] don't worry about them right
[20:06] you and i have a job to do well dale's
[20:09] got a job to do he cleans out all the
[20:11] mess and then here we all come along and
[20:13] we help him we're behind him or helping
[20:15] him standing there with him
[20:17] when anything comes in what
[20:21] we throw up a standard there's a
[20:23] standard gets thrown up
[20:24] and that's not just us brothers it's you
[20:27] brothers and sisters
[20:28] sisters too how many of you sisters i've
[20:31] seen go out in the parking lot
[20:32] and question a preacher that preached
[20:34] something in this
[20:35] boy most people in the message don't
[20:37] like yet because a woman blessed god
[20:39] ain't supposed to do nothing but i
[20:40] thought a woman was church
[20:44] she don't have authority to speak it
[20:45] behind the pulpit but it don't mean
[20:47] she's silent and goes home and cooks and
[20:48] cleans and does whatever
[20:50] whatever she does and and don't say
[20:52] nothing
[20:53] right yeah no if she's got the holy
[20:55] ghost she'll help you
[20:57] hey man i don't know how i got off on
[20:59] that but i'm gonna charge you on that
[21:00] won't charge you for that one
[21:02] it exposes satan see that's our job
[21:05] satan has said in this kind not this i'm
[21:08] talking about
[21:08] satan has said in this message
[21:10] congregation
[21:13] folks he had to be because it wasn't
[21:16] that these preachers all had the holy
[21:17] ghost and all of a sudden they lost it
[21:18] and satan came in
[21:20] no satan was there the whole time but he
[21:22] was so sly he was just picking just a
[21:24] little at a time
[21:25] right just a little bit at the time it's
[21:27] the little foxes that spoil the vine
[21:30] amen so we just i'm just i'm telling you
[21:32] this today
[21:33] like i was beware
[21:37] because satan is not going to quit
[21:39] there's one thing about it he'll get
[21:40] employee of the month
[21:42] because he'll be the best adversary
[21:44] you'll ever have
[21:45] so he'll not quit but listen there's a
[21:48] time and a place where he is going to
[21:50] have to leave you alone because god
[21:53] promised it
[21:54] there's a true church that cannot be
[21:56] deceived
[21:59] and i contend this is that church not
[22:01] the building the people
[22:04] i contend there is a look it exposes
[22:07] satan revealing his works now
[22:09] where is that going to happen on a
[22:10] billboard somewhere we're going to do it
[22:12] on a talk show on television
[22:14] no you're going to do it right here
[22:15] right glory
[22:17] and your daily walk the greatest power
[22:19] that god has
[22:21] is to live his life through you
[22:24] and destroy what not destroy listen you
[22:27] and i can't destroy satan
[22:29] but we can destroy his effect
[22:32] we can destroy his effect listen satan
[22:34] even won't be destroyed
[22:36] i'm sorry the cortisone shot's itching
[22:39] but uh it's not bugs i'm okay i took a
[22:42] shower
[22:43] chop zack but you see that satan comes
[22:46] in and he
[22:47] he picks and when he picks he'll get
[22:50] somebody off to the side and he'll move
[22:52] him around and
[22:53] and you see you you see it but then all
[22:56] of a sudden
[22:57] everything goes quiet
[23:00] be careful that's when satan's really
[23:03] goes to digging
[23:05] so just be careful with that revealing
[23:07] his works
[23:08] it's going to be revealed through me and
[23:10] you it will not be revealed like i said
[23:13] this is not to the world
[23:14] i've got myself a note when we get to
[23:16] the when we get to that nice seeing
[23:18] council
[23:19] do you know at that nice in council in
[23:21] 606 when they ratified everything
[23:24] that 99 of the total
[23:28] christian population of the world were
[23:29] deceived
[23:32] there was only a small little bride that
[23:34] went through that church age right here
[23:36] very small and most of them got killed
[23:39] right
[23:40] went to the lion's den and all the
[23:41] different things fox's book of martyrs
[23:44] but when they had that meeting they
[23:46] thought they but look what did they
[23:48] think
[23:48] in that deception that we're going to
[23:50] read where it says what is deceived to
[23:51] cause to accept is true or valid what is
[23:53] false or invalid
[23:55] they walked up in 606 and said this is
[23:57] what god said
[23:58] right they didn't walk up and say this
[23:59] is what the devil's got for you
[24:01] they said this is what god's got for us
[24:03] and we're going to institute this
[24:05] forever because they're still doing it
[24:07] now
[24:08] just like we'll read here in just a
[24:10] minute where brother brown said
[24:12] that eve was deceived back there and
[24:14] she's still being deceived here
[24:16] all right and eve being what being the
[24:18] church all right
[24:19] so he exposed to satan revealing his
[24:20] works the attempted destruction of what
[24:23] god's people and the discrediting of
[24:26] god's word not doing away with it
[24:29] he's smarter than that he's just going
[24:30] to discredit it these people that have
[24:32] left the message they're not going well
[24:34] some
[24:35] listen some of them are some of them are
[24:36] just going out and being ranked sinners
[24:38] but some of them are just saying well
[24:39] we're just going to preach christ
[24:42] well that's what we're preaching to so
[24:44] what
[24:45] i don't understand you don't understand
[24:48] christ
[24:49] unless you understand this message
[24:51] because christ to you is the third
[24:53] person of a trinity if you're out there
[24:54] in a denominational world
[24:56] christ to you is something else christ
[24:58] to use this one over here
[25:00] no the true christ is the true living
[25:03] god that william branham preached
[25:05] one true and living god just like they
[25:07] did back in
[25:09] in the first part of the church ages
[25:10] amen so look right down to the time he
[25:13] is cast into the lake of fire
[25:15] he fights that he cannot stand it see
[25:18] now
[25:19] when he finds that at the lake of fire
[25:21] guess what look what satan's already
[25:22] been through
[25:24] satan's already been destroyed by me and
[25:26] you
[25:28] he will not harm now what satan got on
[25:30] me and you born again christians he's
[25:32] got this thing
[25:33] right but when he loses that battle
[25:38] when the dead and christ shall rise
[25:39] first and we which are alive and remain
[25:41] will be what
[25:42] changed satan has lost all power on one
[25:46] group of people
[25:47] yet he still thinks he's still going to
[25:50] go through
[25:51] and think he can fight and beat somebody
[25:54] listen this adversary's not weak
[25:58] he's strong but he's only strong because
[26:01] we give him the power
[26:04] amen because remember when we get into
[26:07] the millennium and he has no power to
[26:09] work because he's got no people to work
[26:10] through
[26:11] he's still the same devil right that's
[26:13] right
[26:15] he's still the same devil right he just
[26:17] ain't going to have nobody to work
[26:18] through
[26:19] by a chain of circumstances not a log
[26:21] chain but brother runs to the chain of
[26:23] circumstances what
[26:24] there's no carnal mind there for him to
[26:26] work in right
[26:28] he knows that if a people can get the
[26:30] true revelation now look
[26:32] this is what i've been harping on all
[26:33] week i've been saying true revelation
[26:38] of the true church folks it does come
[26:41] down to razor's edge
[26:43] it does come down to a seed line that is
[26:45] different from all other seed lines but
[26:47] it is not natural
[26:49] it is a spiritual seed line that comes
[26:52] from the loins of jesus christ
[26:54] i mean the inner being not the man part
[26:56] of jesus i'm talking about the inside
[26:58] of the inside of jesus christ and then
[27:00] he speaks it
[27:02] and there is where me and you come from
[27:05] no one in this world has ever come from
[27:07] that
[27:08] right except the bride of jesus christ
[27:10] except 120 in the upper room when it
[27:12] first got started
[27:14] that came right out from the bowels of
[27:16] god and he spoke it right out
[27:18] and then here comes 120 little jesus
[27:21] then you got three thousand and and hey
[27:23] look nicea sure and i see a man knocked
[27:25] him in the head but it sure didn't kill
[27:27] him
[27:27] he didn't kill jesus people physically
[27:30] satan may have killed him but
[27:31] spiritually
[27:32] they were born again christians and you
[27:35] and i will see them there
[27:37] amen you and i will see them there just
[27:39] as real as we're standing here today
[27:41] more real than we're standing here today
[27:44] we will see them
[27:45] and we'll say man how'd you make it
[27:48] through
[27:50] they said it wasn't the outside guy
[27:54] because the outside guy would have
[27:55] turned away he said but it was in that
[27:58] inside man
[28:01] greater is he is in me than he that was
[28:04] in the world
[28:05] what about a testimony of of thousands
[28:08] dying and then they're more rough roman
[28:10] soldiers looking at them
[28:12] and going how can you do this yeah and
[28:15] all they do is just speak to them about
[28:17] well we're dying because jesus christ
[28:19] died on the cross
[28:21] and he saved our soul how many romans
[28:24] did did god save during that time
[28:27] exactly
[28:28] throwing their throwing their sticks
[28:30] down and walking right into there with
[28:31] them so
[28:32] boy to me that's to me that's a a
[28:34] revival you look at and say no these
[28:36] people getting killed no these people
[28:38] getting born again
[28:40] to me that's what revival is is people
[28:42] getting born again
[28:43] not people getting happy you can get
[28:45] happy and not have a revival
[28:48] all right so he knows that if he people
[28:50] gets the true revelation of the true
[28:52] church
[28:52] and what she is and what she stands for
[28:56] and that she can do the greater works
[28:58] she will be an invincible army
[29:01] if they get a true revelation of the two
[29:03] spirits now there he's
[29:04] he's some he's summing it all up right
[29:06] here if they
[29:07] get a true revelation of the two spirits
[29:10] within the framework of the christian
[29:12] church and by
[29:13] god's spirit discern now how do you
[29:16] discern you deserve by the word
[29:17] all right you don't discern by well i
[29:19] think boyd's looking a little
[29:21] no you're deserved by the spirit of god
[29:24] all right
[29:25] and withstand the antichrist spirit
[29:27] satan will be powerless
[29:29] before i love that quote exposition of
[29:32] the church age second quote did you get
[29:33] it now there are these twins again
[29:35] there are these two trees everything's
[29:37] two growing side by side
[29:38] same earth partaking of the same
[29:40] nourishment
[29:42] see when they went to nicaea they didn't
[29:44] go now they didn't go and say well now
[29:45] we found this new thing in
[29:47] india that we're going to try no that
[29:49] was right there
[29:50] right they took the torah and they took
[29:52] the bible to whatever
[29:54] bible was part of it was written i know
[29:55] they had the old testament torah but
[29:56] they had all these
[29:58] all these different people come together
[30:01] and they said this is what we think
[30:03] this is what we think it's being said
[30:06] so we're just going to start baptizing
[30:08] it's like people say you know you say
[30:10] well
[30:10] this water baptism you know what now
[30:12] jesus told us
[30:14] i'll take what jesus said matthew
[30:17] whatever peter said we're not going
[30:19] peter was just an apostle but now we're
[30:20] going to tell you what jesus said
[30:22] they just don't know he's saying the
[30:23] same thing or they both were confused
[30:26] and god's not confused neither was peter
[30:29] because peter had the keys to the
[30:30] kingdom
[30:32] they seemed to forget that little point
[30:34] i think i love what jesus did he said
[30:36] now peter whatever you bind on earth
[30:37] i'll bind in heaven whatever you loose
[30:39] on earth i'll loose in heaven
[30:41] so what he'd done on day of pentecost he
[30:43] loosed the way
[30:44] to be baptized but man come in what
[30:48] tried to put it back together and do
[30:51] away with it what they discredited they
[30:53] didn't take away god's word they
[30:54] discredited the word of god
[30:56] all right now look there are two trees
[30:58] taking the same nourishment
[31:00] drinking in the same rain and benefiting
[31:03] by the same son but they come from
[31:05] different seeds
[31:06] one tree is for the word of god exactly
[31:09] as god giveth and loves it and obeys it
[31:11] the other tree is from the seed that is
[31:13] anti the word
[31:14] and changes it where it wants to it
[31:17] substitutes
[31:18] its own creeds and dogmas for the living
[31:20] true word exactly as did cain who ended
[31:22] up killing abel
[31:23] but fear not little flocks stay with the
[31:25] word keep that word between you and the
[31:26] devil
[31:27] eve did not do that and she failed and
[31:29] when the church lets down on the word
[31:31] she goes
[31:32] into the depths of the darkness of satan
[31:36] not that you leave church you start
[31:37] going to bars
[31:40] no you take on that dogma or that
[31:42] doctrine of the
[31:43] whatever church you want to name you can
[31:46] name them and we'll just
[31:47] we'll just say message church because
[31:49] that's all we're dealing with here we're
[31:50] not we're not dealing with the baptist
[31:52] and the methodist and
[31:53] we know what their doctrines are right
[31:55] but what are our doctrines
[31:56] right because we got to have a true
[31:58] doctrine
[32:00] we've got to be a true church with a
[32:01] true doctrine
[32:03] you got to decide that because look at
[32:06] the next deceived deceived deceiving
[32:08] means the cause to accept that's true or
[32:10] valid what is false
[32:12] or invalid matthew 6 verse 22 talking
[32:15] about the light of the body is the eye
[32:16] if therefore thine i be single the whole
[32:18] body shall be full of light
[32:20] but if thine eye be evil thou hold by
[32:22] evil now bro away
[32:24] evil then people go to church they live
[32:26] the best they can
[32:27] listen in the eyes of god it's evil
[32:32] i'm sorry because these foolish virgins
[32:34] the reason they don't make it to being
[32:36] bride is that somewhere they stopped
[32:38] and to stop is evil
[32:44] to stop i'll read you where brother
[32:46] brown said to stop they just they
[32:47] stopped
[32:49] you know why they stopped i'm gonna say
[32:51] this you know why they stopped because
[32:52] the preacher preached that they
[32:53] should they could stop just believe the
[32:55] message of the hour
[32:58] listen to a couple of tapes it ain't no
[33:00] listen i'm telling you when you get into
[33:01] this message and you start looking at
[33:03] what's going on out there
[33:05] it's no more than the catholic church
[33:08] preacher preach me a sermon pray for my
[33:11] kids
[33:12] you know give me several hail mary's
[33:13] tell me what to do well don't cut your
[33:15] hair and don't do this and do do this
[33:17] and
[33:19] well your bride
[33:22] because you believe the message no
[33:25] you're not
[33:26] right your bride calls you born again
[33:29] and that born again will take you to the
[33:31] message
[33:33] that's the formula that's the true
[33:36] church
[33:38] that's the revelation that satan hates
[33:40] and as soon as as soon as he got into
[33:42] that night seeing council
[33:43] he waited till william branham got here
[33:45] and he got into the message council
[33:50] and started what diluting the word
[33:53] convoluting diluting the word of god
[33:55] sending them off into all these
[33:56] different doctrines but if thine i be
[33:59] evil
[34:01] the whole body shall be full of darkness
[34:03] and if therefore that light that is in
[34:04] there be darkness
[34:06] how great is that darkness what a way to
[34:08] be number three
[34:10] we've read these before i'm going to
[34:11] read through them pretty quick eve
[34:12] actually thought she was right
[34:15] she was getting some new light that
[34:17] satan was giving her he's still
[34:18] giving her new light now look that ain't
[34:22] no light
[34:24] that is not light from god that is not
[34:27] the true light
[34:29] that came into the world according to
[34:30] john 1. no that's darkness that's why
[34:34] it became so dark brother branham said
[34:37] when the picture was drawn he said he
[34:40] drew it come the
[34:41] angel drew it completely dark in our
[34:42] church age he said i
[34:44] added a little bit of light right why
[34:47] it was his people it was his converts it
[34:50] was the message believers
[34:51] which is only about that much of a
[34:53] little sliver at the top
[34:55] let's read number four and studying
[34:57] through many books of the history of the
[34:59] church history's two babylons
[35:01] fox's book of martyrs and pre-nicene
[35:02] council and i see him fathers
[35:04] you go back and find that every spirit
[35:06] in the land every cult everything you go
[35:08] back
[35:08] began in genesis it come up a blooming
[35:11] time
[35:11] a blossoming time you see then
[35:15] them come out like cain and abel and
[35:17] watch those two boys come right down to
[35:18] judas and jesus
[35:21] and just right on through now watch it
[35:22] didn't stop with judas and jesus
[35:25] listen as soon as judas hung himself
[35:26] satan didn't go anywhere
[35:29] he turned around and went right back
[35:31] started that grievous wolves that paul
[35:33] was talking about and all the different
[35:34] things of the antichrist
[35:36] he started right back to work it comes
[35:39] right on out into this last day where
[35:41] the antichrist and the christ spirit so
[35:43] close
[35:44] he deceived the very elected possible
[35:46] now we're taught that
[35:47] and we know that's true now listen it
[35:50] took
[35:51] can you see why god sent up had to send
[35:53] us a true
[35:54] prophet
[35:57] there's been many prophets there's been
[36:00] many prophets even baal was a prophet
[36:03] bailoum i mean balaam was a prophet
[36:05] right but he turned out to be a false
[36:07] one now you don't want to run you don't
[36:08] want to make your church
[36:09] based on that that's why god had to
[36:12] bring us
[36:13] now brother brown's not our absolute but
[36:15] he took us to jesus christ and showed us
[36:17] the absolute of the word
[36:19] and that is our absolute we know that is
[36:22] what's the truth that came
[36:24] that christ is not the third person of
[36:26] the trinity that your baptism
[36:28] is not in titles
[36:35] now remember let's don't stay there
[36:36] though that's the foundation
[36:40] we got to build on up higher than that
[36:42] we got to go on up
[36:43] higher to the speaking of the word and
[36:45] all these different things that's
[36:47] that's right here at us and among us now
[36:49] look at number five
[36:51] this is what i was thinking the other
[36:52] day when i read this quote again
[36:55] now in doing this they consolidated and
[36:57] made the early form the early
[36:59] catholic church then at the first
[37:02] great nicene council when i read that i
[37:06] just
[37:07] fell on my knees you know what
[37:11] that prophet of god you know what
[37:14] happened
[37:16] he saw what was then but he saw what he
[37:20] was dealing with right now
[37:22] when he was dealing in his own time this
[37:25] is what he was dealing with
[37:27] right now it wasn't another time it was
[37:30] right now
[37:30] this is what he was dealing with he said
[37:34] i
[37:34] fell on my knees the great night seeing
[37:38] council take place in a.d 3 25
[37:40] all of them was brought together the
[37:42] bishops the fathers of the christian
[37:43] faith was brought together at nicea
[37:45] the fathers of the christian faith as we
[37:47] said before
[37:48] both spirits came into that room
[37:51] the true and the false now who won the
[37:55] false one we know that
[37:57] but there was still a true church there
[37:58] that tried to get them
[38:00] to change or to stay the way there was
[38:03] that's the reason it's called the nicean
[38:05] council in 8325
[38:07] and about 1500 delegates came to the
[38:09] convention or the council about 1500
[38:11] delegates and the laity outnumbered the
[38:13] bishop
[38:13] five to one look at the power satan had
[38:17] though
[38:18] the laity outnumbered the bishops five
[38:20] to one
[38:21] but yet they still passed whatever all
[38:24] these laws the
[38:26] doctrines that they passed but yet
[38:29] through the nicolaitans the cold formals
[38:32] and constantine's
[38:33] political plan they out-voted the true
[38:37] church and won the victory and issued in
[38:40] bishops and holy order of men
[38:42] taking the holy spirit from the meeting
[38:44] and placing it upon bishops cardinals
[38:46] popes and so forth
[38:47] that's what i got myself a note wrote
[38:49] down here it says
[38:51] satan literally at that time
[38:54] deceived the whole world except just a
[38:57] very i'm talking about just several
[38:59] hundred maybe people
[39:01] can you believe that look how deceptive
[39:03] that is
[39:05] brother east they just said oh we accept
[39:07] that that's good
[39:08] now what that wasn't christ spirit that
[39:11] was the antichrist spirit it deceived
[39:14] the whole world just out of one council
[39:16] and it hadn't stopped right
[39:20] because at this time right here there
[39:22] wasn't a methodist or a baptist or a
[39:24] pentecostal
[39:26] uh-uh it was a roman catholic church
[39:31] then later formed lutherans later formed
[39:35] wesley or
[39:36] or methodist and later formed these
[39:38] listen denominations are not that old
[39:43] not as old as this catholic one right
[39:44] here and you remember that one brother
[39:46] brown said he said
[39:47] well white church he said i come to the
[39:48] original catholic church
[39:50] brother brown said i did two and this
[39:53] guy was talking about 325 or 606 brother
[39:56] ryan was talking about the one
[39:57] in 1830 when the holy ghost fell on the
[39:59] day of pentecost that was the true
[40:00] catholic church
[40:02] because catholic means universal but
[40:05] they
[40:06] adopted listen how much more today is
[40:08] satan
[40:10] adopting what he adopted in that one
[40:13] meeting
[40:15] with 1500 people and they changed the
[40:18] doctrine of the whole
[40:20] world to a false
[40:23] doctrine
[40:28] brother abraham said the father-son holy
[40:29] ghost doctrine come from where pits of
[40:31] hell
[40:32] why because it was a false doctrine
[40:34] everything false has to come from hell
[40:36] right nothing false comes from heaven
[40:40] so it came from the pits of hell and all
[40:41] these other things but now look
[40:44] and let's get on the lighter side though
[40:45] because the lighter side is god winked
[40:47] at the ignorance of some of those people
[40:50] and and birthed them into the body of
[40:51] christ by what word they could find
[40:55] luther west that listen they'll all be
[40:56] there like i said those people
[40:58] those people that went to nicea the true
[41:00] believers the ones that went under
[41:02] columbia and died like
[41:04] god like cattle over there 68 million of
[41:06] them they'll all be there
[41:09] they're just as much bright as you are
[41:11] because they got the same holy ghost you
[41:13] did but now their age
[41:14] required this remember what i thought
[41:18] reggie that quote where brother brown
[41:19] put the box up there and he said
[41:21] every age is required a certain thing
[41:24] right that's right we're not required to
[41:27] give our life
[41:29] in an arena physically
[41:33] but we're required to give our life
[41:35] spiritually
[41:36] right this arena out here is way worse
[41:41] than that roman coliseum right because
[41:43] you fight that devil
[41:44] every day not just one day when he goes
[41:46] in and go cut your head
[41:48] off no you fight him every day when you
[41:50] get up
[41:51] you fight him every day when you get
[41:52] ready to go to bed
[41:54] but they deceive folks the whole world
[41:56] can you think about that
[41:58] just buy a false doctrine right every
[42:02] denomination that came i wish the
[42:03] denominations would realize that
[42:06] that they they did get everything from
[42:08] mama
[42:10] the mother in revelations
[42:12] everything came from her first and then
[42:14] she had what
[42:15] babies daughters denominations
[42:19] and they go right back and like brother
[42:20] brown says and i think i got a quote
[42:22] where a male left it at home
[42:23] where now at the end time there
[42:25] everyone's going to go right back
[42:27] right yeah they're gonna go right back
[42:30] all but the true
[42:31] church the true bride will not go back
[42:36] this true church will not fall this true
[42:38] church will not do like even convolute
[42:41] the word of god
[42:42] this one will not go to nicey and
[42:44] counsel and compromise
[42:49] if you compromise you might be a foolish
[42:51] virgin but you're not going to be bribed
[42:54] so let's read matthew 25 let's begin
[42:56] right here just for a few minutes
[43:00] matthew 25 verse 1.
[43:04] now this is a parable and watch the
[43:06] parable and we're going to break it down
[43:07] a little bit and then we're going to
[43:09] see what brother branham has to say
[43:10] about it everybody okay say amen
[43:16] matthew 25 verse 1. now look then shall
[43:19] the kingdom of heaven now this is not
[43:21] two kingdoms it's developing under the
[43:25] kingdom of heaven
[43:26] right everybody got that right but what
[43:29] happens to the delegates
[43:31] the five foolish is going to bring them
[43:33] out from the kingdom
[43:35] because watch it says then shall the
[43:37] kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten
[43:39] virgins
[43:40] which took their lamps now i'm gonna let
[43:43] brother ryan explain this because he
[43:44] does a lot better job than i do talking
[43:45] about the word virgin
[43:47] all right clean holy set aside
[43:50] then took their lamps and went forth to
[43:52] meet the bridegroom so they were taking
[43:54] everything they needed to take
[43:57] except one had an item that the other
[44:00] one didn't
[44:01] right and five of them were wise
[44:05] and five of them were foolish
[44:08] they that were foolish took their lamp
[44:10] now they had something to put it in
[44:14] listen folks the allegory is that
[44:16] carried the lamp but when we're looking
[44:18] at the revelation right now
[44:20] you are it right you're the vessel
[44:24] that they're carrying to god or to the
[44:26] bridegroom
[44:28] one's bringing it full one's bringing it
[44:31] empty
[44:32] yeah but yet there but look
[44:36] in all defense of the foolish virgins
[44:39] they knew where to go
[44:42] in other words they had been taught to a
[44:44] certain degree they knew where to go
[44:47] and they knew when they run out where to
[44:49] go get it from
[44:51] and they actually did hear the
[44:53] bridegroom call
[44:58] everybody got that
[45:01] because we're going to look at this
[45:03] right here
[45:06] let's read it let's about but the wise
[45:08] took oil
[45:10] in their vessel with their lamps
[45:14] and was it oils top of the holy ghost we
[45:16] know that
[45:17] while the bridegroom tarried oh my we
[45:20] don't want to read this
[45:23] only five of them slumbered and slipped
[45:30] you ever read it that way they all fell
[45:33] asleep
[45:35] all ten of them right fell asleep
[45:39] oh my well we thought them we thought
[45:42] them five wives buddy they got all their
[45:44] lamp they heading to meet the bridegroom
[45:46] something happened
[45:48] they all slumbered and slept while the
[45:52] bridegroom tarried brother brown tells
[45:54] you he said
[45:55] while the bridegroom tarried through
[45:56] seven church ages
[45:58] the bride slumbered and slept
[46:02] sure they were brides sure they were
[46:04] child of god
[46:06] but they slumbered and slept through the
[46:08] church ages
[46:11] and at midnight there was a cry made
[46:13] behold the bridegroom cometh go
[46:15] ye out to meet him then all the virgins
[46:19] rose so they all heard the voice
[46:23] listen we come down we're coming down
[46:25] here to the end time
[46:28] and let me just make it real plain we
[46:30] got the holy ghost
[46:32] and the group does not have the holy
[46:33] ghost everybody got that
[46:35] and there's no tweeners is what we are
[46:37] no tweeners
[46:39] all right either you got it or you don't
[46:42] got it
[46:42] so there's a group that does have it and
[46:44] there's a group that does not have it
[46:46] but now listen what did i say about
[46:48] deception
[46:50] deception is these five
[46:54] believe they got what that five got
[46:57] because they're taking their lamps
[46:58] they're taking
[47:00] and look they took no oil with them but
[47:02] they knew they were going to try to go
[47:03] get some
[47:05] that's right but the foolish said unto
[47:09] the wives then all these virgins rose
[47:10] and trim
[47:11] now look they even all trimmed their
[47:12] lamps they knew what to do
[47:17] let me put it this way they knew the
[47:18] order of the church
[47:21] amen they knew the order of the church
[47:23] it wasn't you're not talking about
[47:25] foolish virgins that
[47:26] are out there in the world no these are
[47:29] virgins these are people that have tried
[47:31] to be as clean as they can be
[47:33] right
[47:36] but something blinded their eyes
[47:41] and you got you can only be blinded by
[47:43] the word of god
[47:46] false shepherds brother brown said
[47:48] blinding the people
[47:51] and the foolish said unto the wise
[47:55] y'all been preaching y'all been
[47:58] preaching up at lula
[47:59] that you got to be justified that you
[48:02] got to be sanctified and you got the
[48:03] holy ghost
[48:04] well well my preacher just told me all i
[48:06] got to do is believe and
[48:07] and that seed just pops to life that
[48:09] always was and
[48:10] and i just am i'm perfect
[48:15] really how can one be teaching one
[48:19] and one be teaching another and they
[48:21] both be right
[48:22] right exactly right
[48:26] then i'm just using us just to make the
[48:28] example you can use whatever church you
[48:30] want to
[48:31] that preaches the truth yeah
[48:34] why would false want to go false they're
[48:37] looking for truth
[48:38] these foolish virgins are looking for
[48:41] something they not had
[48:43] right but they knew where to go look
[48:45] because they they've been listening on
[48:46] the internet for
[48:48] never
[48:51] anyway
[48:56] but that's what's happening folks i only
[48:59] mean here i mean there has got to be a
[49:01] true
[49:02] message going out in this land somewhere
[49:06] i still contend it's right here but
[49:09] it's every it's other places too but
[49:11] there's got to be
[49:13] the truth something for the foolish to
[49:18] have to come and try to find
[49:21] and not be hidden in the corner right
[49:23] they got to know where to come and get
[49:25] it at
[49:26] and the foolish setting of the wise
[49:28] conversation they
[49:30] know who they are
[49:34] give me some of them tapes back in the
[49:37] 90s and
[49:38] brother dale preached seal there in the
[49:40] 80s give me some of them tapes
[49:43] you know what the wives said
[49:46] you've had 40 years i'm sorry
[49:50] you've had 40 years to listen to the
[49:52] message of the hour you've had 50 years
[49:54] to list
[49:55] to find the truth somewhere
[49:59] because look the wise answer to saying
[50:01] not so
[50:02] lest there be not enough for us because
[50:05] you only we aren't going to get in by
[50:06] the skin of our teeth
[50:08] right yeah the skin of our teeth
[50:14] you watch these big airplanes you know
[50:17] when they take off
[50:18] they got so much fuel i am not a lot
[50:21] extra
[50:22] because in case something happens right
[50:25] or they dump it and they don't want to
[50:26] dump 50 000 gallons
[50:28] so they got just enough to maybe get
[50:30] them maybe another hour in other words
[50:31] they got just enough
[50:33] to get them to where they're going
[50:34] because of the weight limitations and
[50:35] all these different things
[50:37] amen same way with us we have weight
[50:40] limitations
[50:41] right yes amen
[50:45] study that we got weight limitations
[50:47] this is what
[50:49] are you full are you empty
[50:53] are you in between all right
[50:57] if you fall then somebody ought to know
[51:00] you're full
[51:01] and that's where they're going to come
[51:02] and say you're full of oil
[51:04] now see i'm not going to go to i'm going
[51:06] to use brother louise i'm not gonna go
[51:07] to brother louise
[51:08] if i know he ain't got no oil
[51:11] and so i need some more brother we said
[51:14] dummy i need something too
[51:16] right you gotta find in other words
[51:18] there's got to be
[51:20] this is the whole thing from this week
[51:21] it's been sound there is a true
[51:24] church there is a true people
[51:28] and they are ringing out the gospel in
[51:31] the end time
[51:32] they are what doesn't matter if people
[51:34] like them or
[51:36] love them doesn't matter that but that
[51:39] but the reason being is
[51:42] they got to have somebody for them
[51:44] foolish version to go to
[51:46] to fulfill that scripture right there
[51:48] like you were talking about fulfilling
[51:49] the scripture about the
[51:50] the sixth thing about the woman right
[51:52] there's the same thing there's got to be
[51:54] a wise virgin
[51:57] let's get oil enough to get out of here
[52:00] glory and be what be able
[52:05] to have so much of it though for their
[52:07] self but that somebody can see
[52:11] and want it want the oil you got
[52:16] remember you remember when when who was
[52:18] that i can't remember in the old
[52:20] in the new testament where they come up
[52:22] and they were preaching and they said
[52:23] well we don't know if there'd be any
[52:24] holy ghost
[52:25] right they baptized they were john's
[52:27] converse and all these different things
[52:29] with paul or one of them said
[52:31] you need to be re-baptized but remember
[52:33] they preached the word laid their hands
[52:34] on the holy ghost fell he said we don't
[52:36] even
[52:36] they were preaching jesus christ without
[52:39] the holy ghost and not even knowing
[52:41] about the holy ghost coming back
[52:42] they just preached that jesus was the
[52:44] christ that's right well
[52:46] what's happening now but how did they
[52:49] hear it
[52:50] there was a true person there was a true
[52:54] gospel walked in that door one day and
[52:57] said what are y'all talking
[52:59] what do you mean and they said we don't
[53:02] know anything about this holy ghost
[53:03] teach us
[53:05] tell us how to get justified sanctified
[53:07] and filled with the holy ghost
[53:09] don't tell me this garbage you always
[53:11] was eternally
[53:12] all you need to do is just come and lay
[53:14] down in the message pew
[53:18] it's not even according to the bible
[53:19] folks
[53:21] take it back to the bible the bible is
[53:22] our absolute amen
[53:24] but the wise answered and said not so
[53:27] lest there be not enough for us and you
[53:30] but go you rather to them that sell and
[53:33] buy for yourselves now watch
[53:36] and while they went to buy
[53:42] go try another place we only got all we
[53:44] got all we got
[53:47] go find another place but look while
[53:50] they were gone
[53:54] here's the key while they were
[53:57] out looking for oil
[54:03] god came the bridegroom came
[54:06] glory and who was standing there the
[54:10] five wives the true
[54:13] church was standing there ready to go
[54:16] waiting to go as as we uh
[54:20] so here brother brown tell that story so
[54:22] vivid about the armored meat packing boy
[54:26] and he had the one dog you know they had
[54:27] the three the four daughters three of
[54:29] them was the denominational church and
[54:31] they dressed up and they who hot around
[54:32] him you know and he
[54:34] looked at the one back there washing
[54:35] dishes and but you know what he told him
[54:37] he said
[54:38] i'll be back in one year to get you he
[54:39] didn't come back to get them other three
[54:43] he had found a character to come and
[54:46] when he walked back in that door
[54:48] that one year later she knew
[54:51] he was coming just for her
[54:55] not for three or four or eight or ten
[54:58] he come back to get one right right
[55:02] that's what he's coming back folks to
[55:03] get one bride now i'm sure them three
[55:06] women
[55:07] i'm sure as brother brown tells the
[55:08] story they they still thought they had a
[55:11] chance
[55:12] you know they put their brother-in-law
[55:14] said manicure
[55:15] they put their manicure home it's a
[55:18] little different but
[55:19] make up but they put that up and they
[55:21] danced around but you know what
[55:23] he'd made up his mind a year later i
[55:25] mean the year before that
[55:26] right who he was coming back after it
[55:29] did not matter how much they shouted
[55:31] spoke in tongues and phil pughs
[55:35] he was coming after that one girl and
[55:37] that because what
[55:38] that one girl was true
[55:41] she was a true bride those others look
[55:44] those others were potential brides
[55:47] they were female they were potential
[55:48] bride
[55:51] but he only came back to get one he come
[55:54] to get the true bride
[55:56] and while they went to buy the armored
[55:58] meat packing boy came
[56:01] and they that were ready went in with
[56:04] him to the marriage
[56:06] and the door was shut
[56:10] no more sick couldn't get in three
[56:11] couldn't get in two couldn't get in
[56:13] one extra couldn't get in
[56:16] but afterwards came also the other
[56:18] virgin saying lord lord open to us
[56:22] but he answered and said now see so the
[56:23] lord's not just totally
[56:25] leaving them without anything because
[56:26] remember the prophet of god told us and
[56:28] i couldn't find that quote
[56:30] because i couldn't figure out how it was
[56:32] worded where
[56:33] brother brown said that that there would
[56:35] be a small voice
[56:37] would tell you that you missed it
[56:41] i mean when we clean out of here and get
[56:43] out of here there'll be a small voice
[56:44] say you missed it
[56:46] that's what's happening right here he
[56:47] answered and said verily i say unto you
[56:51] i know you not right that meat packing
[56:54] boy he didn't study them other three
[56:56] girls
[56:58] he probably didn't even know what color
[57:00] clothes they had on
[57:02] but he did that one right he knew that
[57:05] one true girl he was coming back after
[57:07] her
[57:08] he didn't care what him other ones had
[57:09] on and he says i know you not
[57:12] watch therefore for you no not whether
[57:14] the days of the hour
[57:15] or in the son of man see that's what
[57:18] they're missing
[57:19] they're missing the coming of the son of
[57:21] man not that you know
[57:22] like i said before they and talk to some
[57:25] a denomination
[57:26] little person and just ask him say well
[57:29] what is this
[57:30] eastern cloud what's this christ coming
[57:32] down through the eastern skies because
[57:34] you know we sing the song
[57:36] and we know that that the bible says
[57:38] he'll that every eye
[57:41] shall see him and he'll come down
[57:42] through the clouds and apart the sky
[57:45] that's where the denominations have been
[57:47] taught
[57:49] you hear what i'm saying taught that
[57:51] that's when christ is coming to get down
[57:55] and i told a friend of mine that i
[57:57] worked with
[57:58] he said i'll just and he was sincere oh
[58:00] so sincere
[58:02] he said i'll be so glad when i can look
[58:03] up in that sky and i can see the
[58:05] the clouds part and jesus walk down and
[58:08] come and get me
[58:11] and i said that's okay i said but my
[58:14] bible tells me he's going to come and
[58:15] get a group
[58:17] like a thief in the night
[58:20] he's going to be come and get a secret
[58:22] group of people
[58:24] now you might see him coming down the
[58:26] east but you brother brown said
[58:28] he's coming for judgment he's not coming
[58:31] to get a bride when the whole world
[58:32] sees him come down the the portals of
[58:35] glory no
[58:36] right no watch therefore for you know
[58:39] neither the day of the hour wherein the
[58:40] son of man that's what we're living
[58:42] under now the son of man
[58:43] and who is the son of man he's the word
[58:45] but where's the word it's inside you
[58:48] me and you you and i are the wise
[58:52] virgins
[58:56] let's listen to what brother brown said
[58:57] right here real quick and we'll be done
[59:01] but do you see though where the two
[59:02] spirits are though how close it is even
[59:04] with the wise and the foolish virgin
[59:06] the wise virgin is they have the holy
[59:09] spirit
[59:11] the foolish virgin have just enough of
[59:13] some kind of spirit to make them i'll
[59:15] read this in a minute
[59:18] that's why you know brother brown said
[59:20] you could have the holy ghost on your
[59:22] spirit every day of your life and die
[59:24] and go to hell
[59:26] so close it's where that holy spirit's
[59:30] at
[59:31] right in the wise virgins it was in
[59:33] their lamp
[59:35] right the foolish version their lamps
[59:37] were empty
[59:38] but now they were clean they trimmed
[59:40] their lamps they cleaned everything up
[59:43] i'm just telling you folks we need to
[59:45] watch and not
[59:46] miss the true church
[59:49] not miss the true true church
[59:54] because if you're not in the true church
[59:55] you're in the false one right
[59:57] there's no in-betweener all right look
[59:59] at number six here real quick
[1:00:00] israel in the church and that's what's
[1:00:03] going to happen one of these days
[1:00:04] brother
[1:00:05] when the separating time comes and to
[1:00:07] you you lukewarm church member
[1:00:10] that you're trying to impersonate
[1:00:11] christianity one of these days
[1:00:13] you're gonna try to follow that holy
[1:00:15] ghost band
[1:00:16] and you'll find out your wheels will
[1:00:19] come off yonder
[1:00:22] in the mud somewhere
[1:00:25] that's right there was ten virgins went
[1:00:27] to meet the lord five of them were wise
[1:00:29] and five foolish
[1:00:30] put oil in your lamp tremor bright one
[1:00:32] of these days
[1:00:34] they're going up all right let's read
[1:00:36] number seven 10 virgins and 144 000 and
[1:00:38] listen to this it's kind of a long quote
[1:00:39] but i like it
[1:00:40] now watch both of them were virgins now
[1:00:44] think about what i just said
[1:00:46] that was me quoting for the ones on the
[1:00:49] internet that was me quoting not brother
[1:00:50] adam
[1:00:51] this is him quote now let me get this
[1:00:54] here let's take these two right here
[1:00:57] this is the virgin
[1:00:58] and this is a virgin this is a foolish
[1:01:00] virgin
[1:01:01] and this is a wise virgin he may be
[1:01:03] setting something up on the counter or
[1:01:04] something
[1:01:05] but both of them are virgins now you'll
[1:01:07] take that name virgin and run it down it
[1:01:09] means holy clean sanctified
[1:01:11] so we're not talking about a dirty group
[1:01:12] of people
[1:01:14] we are not never i and this whole time
[1:01:16] i've never talked about
[1:01:17] a dirty group of people as far as what
[1:01:19] you see
[1:01:22] because they try to live the best they
[1:01:23] can the word sanctified comes from the
[1:01:26] word sainted which means clean
[1:01:28] like the hebrew word now that's a greek
[1:01:31] word saint phi means clean now the
[1:01:32] hebrew word is to make holy
[1:01:34] and ours is clean now they take the
[1:01:36] three words like each word has the same
[1:01:38] meaning but it spoke different like the
[1:01:39] word clean holy sanctified
[1:01:41] all three the same all right now
[1:01:44] this is a continuation of the quote but
[1:01:46] i cut some out because he was talking
[1:01:47] about a dog being in spanish being pie
[1:01:50] blue in different ones
[1:01:51] different so i'd cut that out because
[1:01:53] you don't need that
[1:01:55] i'm not splicing tapes okay you just
[1:01:58] didn't need that
[1:02:00] now there was the virgins went out to
[1:02:02] meet him and the foolish virgin now
[1:02:04] did not have oil in their lamp but they
[1:02:06] had everything
[1:02:08] else
[1:02:12] they were clean they believed in christ
[1:02:15] they preached the word look that they
[1:02:17] believed
[1:02:19] their denomination would let them preach
[1:02:21] they preached that
[1:02:22] the second coming the sacrifice the
[1:02:24] atonement they believe
[1:02:27] you ever tie up with a good baptist
[1:02:28] scholar one time huh you better know
[1:02:30] what you're talking about uh-huh sure
[1:02:31] had
[1:02:32] but you see so close said matthew 24 24
[1:02:36] read it right away and you'll see it
[1:02:39] jesus said in this last days the two
[1:02:40] spirits would be so close together until
[1:02:42] it would deceive the very elect if it
[1:02:43] was possible
[1:02:44] it'll be so close it'll swing them
[1:02:46] pentecostals like nobody's business now
[1:02:48] listen folks it's already done that
[1:02:50] right right that's already been done and
[1:02:53] the pentecostals in this message has
[1:02:54] done the same thing
[1:02:57] sorry
[1:03:00] that made you a little quiet
[1:03:04] listen we're all pentecostal by
[1:03:08] experience
[1:03:08] right so we're not doing away with
[1:03:10] brother brown talks about pentecostal
[1:03:14] denominations
[1:03:17] because we're all i wouldn't mind if we
[1:03:20] had a little pentecost break out anyway
[1:03:22] a little good a little all gets spilled
[1:03:26] every once in a while
[1:03:28] running out all over the place all right
[1:03:30] let's read this last quote we'll be done
[1:03:36] this is questions and answers this is
[1:03:37] the question after the bride is raptured
[1:03:39] will any of the foolish virgin now watch
[1:03:41] the question
[1:03:42] after the bride is rapture will any of
[1:03:44] the foolish virgin be
[1:03:45] saved or will they all be lost now look
[1:03:48] he says no
[1:03:52] no they won't be saved he's not saying
[1:03:56] or they'll all be lost no
[1:03:59] no see everything will be finished for
[1:04:02] the gentile church when the bride is
[1:04:03] taken from the earth everybody got that
[1:04:06] all right the spirit of god leaves the
[1:04:08] earth
[1:04:09] now the only time you're going to see
[1:04:11] that spirit of god
[1:04:13] any time after that until the millennium
[1:04:15] is where
[1:04:16] jews 144 000 god comes from here he goes
[1:04:20] over to the jews
[1:04:20] he's not working through the foolish
[1:04:22] virgin
[1:04:24] they have no oil that oil is now going
[1:04:27] to be
[1:04:28] used over in israel through two prophets
[1:04:31] to bring out 144 thousand
[1:04:33] all gentiles is done with the spirit of
[1:04:36] god leaves the earth he just felt his
[1:04:37] filthy steel he does righteousness
[1:04:39] righteous still he that is holy as holy
[1:04:40] still
[1:04:41] in other words the sanctuary becomes
[1:04:43] smoky where the attorney stands to plead
[1:04:45] the case
[1:04:46] christ leaves the sanctuary his days of
[1:04:49] mediatorial is over
[1:04:51] the rapture comes he leaves from the
[1:04:53] sanctuary goes forth and takes the book
[1:04:55] of redemption
[1:04:56] and claims everything he redeem he's
[1:04:57] redeemed because look the foolish virgin
[1:04:59] is not in redemption considered in that
[1:05:01] part of redemption
[1:05:03] now they will be redeemed
[1:05:06] right but they're not they redeemed
[1:05:10] when the redeemed they're gathering it
[1:05:12] thee
[1:05:14] that's not for this virgin that's not a
[1:05:17] cup of water
[1:05:18] that's not jews at that point
[1:05:22] there's no more military work how many
[1:05:24] understand that
[1:05:26] i got it on one of the seals or one of
[1:05:27] the other seals i believe it was that
[1:05:29] christ comes forth to claim his mediator
[1:05:31] work
[1:05:31] now look now just a minute will the
[1:05:33] foolish virgin be
[1:05:35] saved no
[1:05:38] now you've got to be careful they will
[1:05:41] be saved at the white zone judgment as
[1:05:43] far as saved from
[1:05:46] hell but to be saved on earth
[1:05:50] no they won't be saved
[1:05:53] in this part like we're me and you right
[1:05:55] now no they will not be saved here on
[1:05:57] the earth
[1:05:58] they'll have to go to the white zone
[1:06:00] judgment they'll and you know what
[1:06:01] they'll do though
[1:06:02] but here's the point they'll keep their
[1:06:04] testimony
[1:06:05] during the tribulation period and give
[1:06:08] their life
[1:06:09] and stand up and say look we may have
[1:06:11] missed it
[1:06:13] i like that though really i don't want
[1:06:14] to be one but you stand there and say i
[1:06:17] might have missed it
[1:06:20] but you're not going to make me bad at
[1:06:21] what you're doing
[1:06:24] so there god is going to he's already
[1:06:27] sanctified him he's not going to give
[1:06:28] him the holy ghost but he's going to
[1:06:30] give them at the white throne judgment
[1:06:31] he says what the bible say if you stand
[1:06:33] for me
[1:06:34] i'll stand for you so they stood for
[1:06:37] what they believed in in the tribulation
[1:06:40] but look folks don't think we can get in
[1:06:43] and just say well
[1:06:44] i think i'll just not read or or study
[1:06:46] no more and i'll just be a foolish
[1:06:47] virgin
[1:06:49] god knows you said that right and that
[1:06:51] ain't gonna work
[1:06:53] amen but listen
[1:06:58] what's wrong be a wise version get the
[1:07:00] holy ghost
[1:07:02] he'll give it to everybody that asked
[1:07:03] for it and asked for it the right way
[1:07:07] now just a minute will the footless
[1:07:09] virgin be saved no
[1:07:11] they will not be saved here on the earth
[1:07:13] during the time of the gentiles they
[1:07:14] will not be saved
[1:07:16] but they will be saved at the white
[1:07:17] throne judgment everybody got that say
[1:07:19] ma'am
[1:07:21] now whatever happens she happens now
[1:07:24] after that time she's in the state now
[1:07:26] she will have to go through the
[1:07:27] tribulation period and the reason of it
[1:07:28] is
[1:07:29] because she has rejected the atonement
[1:07:31] look
[1:07:32] he just said they had the atonement up
[1:07:34] here
[1:07:35] but they rejected it in its fullness
[1:07:40] they only went so far they went outer
[1:07:43] court
[1:07:44] inner court never went into the holy of
[1:07:46] holies
[1:07:48] everybody got that they didn't receive
[1:07:50] it in this fullness
[1:07:52] because to receive it in his fullness is
[1:07:54] you become a partaker of what's inside
[1:07:56] of that holy of holies
[1:07:58] amen everybody okay with that the reason
[1:08:02] she is
[1:08:02] is because she has rejected the
[1:08:05] atonement
[1:08:06] in its fullness in other words some
[1:08:08] preacher says well sister you haven't
[1:08:09] cut your hair
[1:08:11] you believe the message well you got it
[1:08:14] well she just sits there and says okay i
[1:08:15] got it
[1:08:19] not without an experience she ain't got
[1:08:21] it and i say she i mean church i don't
[1:08:24] mean a woman i mean the church
[1:08:26] but why they were blinded by false
[1:08:28] shepherds
[1:08:31] because he might have preached the
[1:08:32] atonement as just
[1:08:34] believing this message instead of
[1:08:37] believing the atonement that jesus
[1:08:38] christ died for your sins
[1:08:40] and you've got to be justified
[1:08:42] sanctified and filled with the holy
[1:08:43] ghost to receive the new birth
[1:08:46] oh boy she's a believer
[1:08:50] a professed believer right but she will
[1:08:54] have to go through the tribulation
[1:08:55] period
[1:08:56] the bible said and the rest of them the
[1:08:57] dragon spurted water out of her mouth to
[1:08:59] go and make war
[1:09:00] and what an hour that is and that's what
[1:09:03] happens the dragon what satan
[1:09:05] or you can say whatever system you want
[1:09:07] to say roman catholic church
[1:09:09] spurted water out of its mouth and made
[1:09:12] war
[1:09:12] what that's where brother brown says
[1:09:14] they're going to have to give their life
[1:09:15] for the gospel be hunted down like dogs
[1:09:19] but now don't tell me though
[1:09:23] that the attitude of all those say five
[1:09:28] foolish virgins they gotta all be the
[1:09:31] same
[1:09:32] you can't have one with an attitude i
[1:09:33] mean one i mean one somebody say
[1:09:35] well i didn't make it so i'm just i'm
[1:09:37] just i ain't gonna fool with this i'm
[1:09:39] just gonna
[1:09:40] god knows that right a true foolish
[1:09:43] virgin will hold
[1:09:44] true all the way through just like a
[1:09:46] true believer just like this true church
[1:09:48] just like this true
[1:09:50] doctrine i'm talking about this true
[1:09:51] message i'm talking about
[1:09:53] it will take us in a rapture
[1:09:56] but whatever they had was a part
[1:10:03] not the fullness right they rejected the
[1:10:06] fullness
[1:10:07] right they didn't reject the part
[1:10:11] believe when the lord jesus christ and
[1:10:12] thou shalt be saved they believed
[1:10:15] brother brown says there she is a
[1:10:17] believer a professed believer
[1:10:20] but somebody told her in a
[1:10:23] false church with a false preacher
[1:10:27] that you're okay no problem
[1:10:30] you come to church you i see your hair's
[1:10:33] long sister you don't put on no makeup
[1:10:37] that's why brother dale says he preaches
[1:10:39] to the heart of you
[1:10:42] and see that's what we try to reach the
[1:10:44] heart of you
[1:10:45] what's inside will definitely manifest
[1:10:48] on the outside don't get me wrong
[1:10:51] but if you preach to what's inside
[1:10:54] to me see that's the fullness because
[1:10:56] where are you going in the fullness
[1:10:57] you're going
[1:10:58] into the holy of holies glory
[1:11:01] everybody's got a holy of holies
[1:11:03] some are unholy some are holy
[1:11:06] but that's what a preacher should preach
[1:11:08] is to your little box right in here
[1:11:12] your soul but let's be careful
[1:11:17] because that doctrine almost 2 000 years
[1:11:21] ago
[1:11:22] fooled the whole world except a small
[1:11:24] group of people
[1:11:27] and out of there is going to be foolish
[1:11:28] virgins in every
[1:11:30] church age has foolish virgins
[1:11:34] right right it didn't say just one time
[1:11:37] here at the end time no
[1:11:38] i mean you know it says the bridegroom
[1:11:40] cometh but you've got to understand
[1:11:42] that when they hear the call
[1:11:45] they're going to come up out of the
[1:11:46] ground right they may be passed on
[1:11:49] literally like paul
[1:11:50] irenaeus martin their group they're gone
[1:11:53] on
[1:11:54] but they're true they're not foolish
[1:11:55] virgins they're true brides
[1:11:57] and when they hear that bridegroom call
[1:12:00] but where does it come from
[1:12:02] it doesn't come from a megaphone that's
[1:12:04] why people are that's what that
[1:12:05] brother was you know he's waiting for
[1:12:07] the truth
[1:12:10] and jesus just to kind of somehow walk
[1:12:13] up on a cloud and say
[1:12:14] i'm here that's not the way it's going
[1:12:17] to be but you know what
[1:12:18] he's living off what he was told yeah
[1:12:21] just like most of you fall for don't you
[1:12:24] don't fall now but most of you fell for
[1:12:26] that old thing
[1:12:27] they ain't a bit of scripture for it
[1:12:29] they're all mama
[1:12:31] she's walking the streets of gold with
[1:12:32] jesus right now
[1:12:34] well now who told them that god sent us
[1:12:37] a prophet to tell us
[1:12:38] that's not happening until we get to
[1:12:41] glory
[1:12:42] right now they're sitting in a sixth
[1:12:44] dimension
[1:12:46] eternal though praising god but they're
[1:12:48] not seeing jesus
[1:12:52] that cleared all that up see it's not
[1:12:54] convoluted for us anymore
[1:12:56] and listen don't roll your eyes when
[1:12:58] they say that because you know what they
[1:13:00] base their
[1:13:04] based their believing on that right yeah
[1:13:06] then as soon as mama oh she just woke up
[1:13:08] in the arms of jesus
[1:13:10] or she's talking with jesus right now or
[1:13:12] she's talking with uncle earl well if
[1:13:13] uncle larrow made it she's talking to
[1:13:14] uncle earl
[1:13:16] but if uncle laura didn't make it she
[1:13:17] wasn't
[1:13:19] but you see what god sent a prophet to
[1:13:20] bring all that to pass
[1:13:24] to show what true
[1:13:28] what's true and what's false
[1:13:32] all that i just told you that most
[1:13:34] denomination most denominations preach
[1:13:36] that you're going to go through the
[1:13:37] tribulation now that's not in the bible
[1:13:42] now it took a prophet though to tell us
[1:13:44] that the church will go through the
[1:13:46] tribulation
[1:13:47] but the bride will not go through the
[1:13:49] tribulation
[1:13:50] that's right see brother donnie we had
[1:13:52] that all convoluted that now
[1:13:53] everybody's got to go through this
[1:13:55] tribulation three and a half years major
[1:13:57] three and a half years minor
[1:13:59] they got all the they got all the
[1:14:00] groundwork
[1:14:03] because look denominational doctrines
[1:14:05] didn't come from
[1:14:06] griers almanac it came from the bible
[1:14:09] but it was because somebody with a
[1:14:11] convoluted idea and convoluted means
[1:14:13] something that's just it's not true
[1:14:15] but it looks kind of true but what's
[1:14:17] deceiving
[1:14:19] what's that word deceiving
[1:14:22] believing something that's not true
[1:14:26] but it seems so true to you
[1:14:29] i mean don't ever go if somebody has a
[1:14:31] mama pass away in a denominational world
[1:14:34] don't ever walk up to them and say
[1:14:36] yo mama i ain't walking with jesus today
[1:14:38] just let them go because that's what
[1:14:40] they've been taught
[1:14:42] but see that's false when they come and
[1:14:45] tell you about the
[1:14:46] water baptism of the name father son
[1:14:48] holy ghost you know in your spirit that
[1:14:50] that's false
[1:14:52] but it's all they know that's all you
[1:14:55] knew wasn't it
[1:14:56] right until you come to light that's all
[1:14:59] we all knew
[1:15:00] we all come through them things but what
[1:15:03] does a true bride do she goes to the
[1:15:05] true word
[1:15:06] glory let's stand to our feet always the
[1:15:09] true bride
[1:15:10] will go to the true word she has to be
[1:15:12] because she's part of it
[1:15:18] and the deception is is to go part of
[1:15:20] the way
[1:15:24] just like the foolish virgin just go
[1:15:26] part of the way
[1:15:28] that's the deception that's the real
[1:15:36] deception
[1:15:39] you love the lord i tell you you just
[1:15:43] you i want you to i want you to
[1:15:46] just sit down and think what you've been
[1:15:49] brought through
[1:15:51] and everything now for some of us that
[1:15:54] grew up in a message just a little bit
[1:15:55] different
[1:15:56] but like brother boyd and different ones
[1:15:57] that come in the message later on in
[1:15:59] life
[1:15:59] just think of the things that you
[1:16:00] believe that you had to leave
[1:16:03] i mean really a storehouse full right
[1:16:06] but most of us louise brother
[1:16:09] all the different ones that i mean a lot
[1:16:11] of us grew up in the message and this is
[1:16:12] all we know which is okay but you still
[1:16:14] had your own ideas about certain things
[1:16:16] but think about though what what god had
[1:16:19] to
[1:16:20] change now you never change the bible
[1:16:22] that's right
[1:16:24] bible never changed but something
[1:16:28] changed in you
[1:16:30] that made you become wise
[1:16:33] where you used to be foolish
[1:16:36] because you went to church you did what
[1:16:38] you thought was right
[1:16:42] uh then people go to catholic church i
[1:16:44] mean they some of them that go more
[1:16:45] church than we do
[1:16:47] they go to mass they believe that that
[1:16:49] priest is changing that thing to the
[1:16:50] body of jesus christ and that they're
[1:16:52] partaking
[1:16:53] and they believe but it's total faults
[1:16:58] total faults right hail mary's and all
[1:17:02] these dif but you know what
[1:17:03] people will shoot you and kill you for
[1:17:04] it if you try to change them because
[1:17:07] see folks it takes the holy ghost to
[1:17:08] change you
[1:17:10] you can't be changed by your mom and
[1:17:12] your daddy you can't be changed by a
[1:17:14] preacher
[1:17:16] amen you got to be changed by god
[1:17:18] knocking on your door
[1:17:19] and somewhere you understanding that you
[1:17:23] have been taught false
[1:17:25] and you know what if you accept that
[1:17:27] you've been taught false
[1:17:28] there's hope for you if you reject
[1:17:32] truth you become a truth rejecter
[1:17:36] and there's no foolish virgin part for
[1:17:37] you
[1:17:39] because brother brown said word
[1:17:40] rejecters go to hell
[1:17:43] god bless you think it will continue us
[1:17:46] on a little bit further
[1:17:47] remember us tomorrow as we leaving
[1:17:49] tomorrow morning it'll
[1:17:50] kill us a big old buck man let's think
[1:17:54] 237
[1:17:55] [Music]
[1:18:02] [Music]
[1:18:11] it bathed my heart in love and
[1:18:14] wrote my name above and just a little
[1:18:17] talk when jesus cleared the way
[1:18:19] hey that's right now let us have a
[1:18:22] little talk with jesus
[1:18:25] tell him all about her you know that
[1:18:27] jesus though is not going to tell you
[1:18:28] about
[1:18:29] what that song says he wrote your name
[1:18:32] down before the foundation of the world
[1:18:35] he didn't write your name down the night
[1:18:37] you got saved
[1:18:38] there's another doctrine that we can
[1:18:40] talk about
[1:18:41] [Music]
[1:18:52] sometimes
[1:18:54] the midst of sin may rise and hide the
[1:18:58] sorrow skies
[1:19:00] but just a little talk when jesus clears
[1:19:02] the way
[1:19:04] now let us have a little talk with jesus
[1:19:08] tell him all about our troubles hear our
[1:19:11] faintest cry
[1:19:13] he will land survive
[1:19:16] feel the prayer will turn him you know
[1:19:19] the fire is burning find a little talk
[1:19:22] with jesus
[1:19:23] makes it right if you have a need
[1:19:27] [Music]
[1:19:29] my eyes be filled with tears but jesus
[1:19:32] is a friend who watches day and
[1:19:38] [Music]
[1:19:46] [Applause]
[1:19:49] that he's going to have a true bride
[1:19:52] with a true
[1:19:53] doctrine not many different ones one
[1:19:56] truth
[1:19:58] one true doctrine
[1:20:07] amen you love the lord think about that
[1:20:12] he is not protecting you as an
[1:20:14] individual because we goof up all the
[1:20:16] time
[1:20:17] he's protecting his word and if you're a
[1:20:20] part of it though
[1:20:22] he's got to protect you what did eve do
[1:20:25] she come out from under her protection
[1:20:27] and you see what happened one word
[1:20:31] but we stay in that protection of that
[1:20:33] word
[1:20:36] foolish virgin is one word off
[1:20:41] they didn't go just you know what
[1:20:42] separates the outer court from the inner
[1:20:44] court
[1:20:45] one curtain you know what separates the
[1:20:46] inner court the middle court from the
[1:20:49] inner court one curtain young guy go
[1:20:52] through the jungle
[1:20:53] right
[1:20:57] that's all that separates you have you
[1:21:00] ever thought about that sitting in an
[1:21:01] airplane
[1:21:04] you sit in an airplane you look out
[1:21:05] there in that on that wing and you say
[1:21:09] i'm this far from dying the thickness of
[1:21:14] the wall of that airplane
[1:21:16] i'm that close right if i was on the
[1:21:19] other side bro luis i'd be dead
[1:21:21] that much that's how close to death when
[1:21:24] i think about it though in a natural
[1:21:25] though you're that close to death but
[1:21:27] who protects you
[1:21:30] you get in you get inside you listen you
[1:21:32] depend on delta
[1:21:33] to build the plane right you're right
[1:21:36] you depend on the engineers to do the
[1:21:38] thing right i don't care how much they
[1:21:40] pay them pilots
[1:21:42] as long as they get me there safe i
[1:21:45] really don't care because
[1:21:46] it's their expertise is what gets that
[1:21:49] piece of machinery
[1:21:51] safely from one destination to another
[1:21:54] and you're included in that destination
[1:21:56] because you're inside of that well now
[1:21:58] think more of what god's done
[1:22:00] there may be mistakes in engineering and
[1:22:02] there may be mistakes in the pilot era
[1:22:04] they call it in different things
[1:22:06] but there's never been an error in this
[1:22:08] old ship of zion
[1:22:11] he built it right the first time it's
[1:22:14] going to go through storms of life
[1:22:17] it's going to go through stormy seas but
[1:22:19] it will never crack up
[1:22:21] it will never fail you the sails will
[1:22:24] never come down they will never tear
[1:22:27] that old ship of zion but you know what
[1:22:29] if you're not in it
[1:22:32] you know what separated noah from the
[1:22:34] bill
[1:22:35] billions of people that thickness of the
[1:22:38] ark
[1:22:39] is what this this people were safe
[1:22:43] that distance brother boyd everybody on
[1:22:46] the outside
[1:22:47] in the whole world died right
[1:22:51] people don't let that much stop you
[1:22:55] don't let that much get inside to safety
[1:23:00] if you don't have the holy ghost please
[1:23:01] pray to god that you got it if
[1:23:03] if if you do got it still pray to god
[1:23:05] that you get it
[1:23:06] amen because like brother dale says i'd
[1:23:08] rather seek it all my life and
[1:23:10] and and then all of a sudden see beca
[1:23:13] well that's what i was going to bring
[1:23:14] out tonight
[1:23:15] sit back down we'll start over again i'm
[1:23:17] just kidding
[1:23:19] no but that's what it said if if you
[1:23:21] think you got it
[1:23:23] and you don't isn't that foolish
[1:23:26] you're a foolish virgin you're foolish
[1:23:31] but if you're praying and asking god
[1:23:35] because i'm going to tell you something
[1:23:38] when aaron went back behind that
[1:23:41] paper-thin veil when he pushed that
[1:23:44] thing open and walked in everything was
[1:23:48] supposed to be
[1:23:49] 100 what the word said
[1:23:52] one thing off meant death and he
[1:23:55] couldn't go in there and go oops
[1:24:00] that's why they said they tied the rope
[1:24:01] around the priest's feet they got inside
[1:24:03] there and they had an oops moment and
[1:24:05] they died
[1:24:05] because they didn't get it right and
[1:24:06] they'd have to drag them back out but
[1:24:08] what about a holy god that gives you the
[1:24:09] baptism of the holy ghost though
[1:24:11] he won't have to drag you out he just
[1:24:13] says come boldly to the throne of grace
[1:24:15] come
[1:24:16] throw back the curtain throw back the
[1:24:19] curtain if he hadn't throwed your
[1:24:20] curtain back i hope to god he throws
[1:24:22] your curtain back
[1:24:25] and you see the mercy seat which you see
[1:24:27] jesus christ
[1:24:29] and him crucified will you see that and
[1:24:31] then you say god save me if i'm not
[1:24:33] saved fill me with the holy ghost if i'm
[1:24:35] not full of the holy ghost
[1:24:37] even if he tells me i'm full of the holy
[1:24:38] ghost i'm still going to say lord i need
[1:24:41] more of the holy ghost
[1:24:42] amen you love the lord

[1:24:48] prayer and all these different ones
