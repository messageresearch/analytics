[0:00] it's the last time we were talking about
[0:01] able sacrifice
[0:03] and how that types of the baptism and
[0:05] the holy ghost
[0:12] so we're just going to continue on with
[0:14] this
[0:14] story this
[0:18] this story is really the story of every
[0:20] believer because it tells the story of
[0:22] how we came out of
[0:30] it's like pointing towards your yeah
[0:32] there you go
[0:34] towards your
[0:35] back
[0:45] all right
[0:46] this is um this is the story of
[0:49] how we came out of the nomination and
[0:51] received a revelation from god and how
[0:53] the message was vindicated and our
[0:56] baptism of the holy ghost was vindicated
[0:58] and then uh
[1:00] you know once you
[1:01] once you start talking about that
[1:03] people want to destroy your influence
[1:06] and um
[1:07] so that's that's really what the main
[1:10] topic i want to talk about today is how
[1:12] the message was vindicated and how
[1:15] our lives were vindicated and paralleled
[1:17] with that but let's start from the top
[1:19] with genesis 4 1
[1:22] and adam knew eve is a wife and she
[1:24] conceived and bear can said i have
[1:26] gotten a man from the lord
[1:28] so we're all familiar with how
[1:31] she she couldn't have gotten the man
[1:33] from satan because satan's not a creator
[1:35] it had to have come from god
[1:38] because god sets laws in the universe
[1:40] and and he put a law into place that um
[1:45] when someone's born you know
[1:47] they come from god so
[1:50] you know what
[1:51] what
[1:52] she's really what really has happened
[1:54] here is
[1:56] eve
[1:57] thought that she she still thought that
[2:00] she was right
[2:02] and um
[2:03] so let me just start getting things
[2:05] started by reading some quotes and the
[2:06] smyrna and church age brother adam said
[2:09] when cain was born she said i've gotten
[2:10] a man from the lord
[2:12] now do you realize that she really meant
[2:14] that she thought that she had a man from
[2:15] the lord
[2:17] you see once she had been deceived by
[2:19] taking the word of satan instead of the
[2:20] word of god she then thought that
[2:22] whatever she said was right
[2:24] if she said that she had a man from god
[2:26] that she had a man from god
[2:29] but god has set laws in his universe a
[2:31] good seed can only bring forth good
[2:33] fruit
[2:34] and the evil seed can bring forth
[2:36] only evil fruit
[2:38] now each seed though different will
[2:40] utilize the same earth nourishment
[2:41] moisture and sunshine but it will bring
[2:43] forth after its own kind
[2:46] so everything started by
[2:48] uh
[2:49] god had a spoken word and satan had a
[2:51] spoken word and that's how everything
[2:54] starts when you start when you receive
[2:57] when you take one word out or add one
[2:59] word to it
[3:01] and it
[3:02] impregnates the womb of your mind and it
[3:04] brings forth actions right so that's
[3:07] really where it all started
[3:10] uh if you look at the statement of eve
[3:12] real close this is also the smartening
[3:14] church age will notice she had more of
[3:16] an understanding than most realized
[3:18] she did not attribute the son to satan
[3:20] for that would have made him equal with
[3:22] god
[3:24] and she believed that cain was from god
[3:27] she accepted the devil's lies the truth
[3:29] of god that is exactly what we have now
[3:32] churches set themselves up as fountains
[3:34] of truth but the truth is not in them
[3:36] yet their begotten children swear by
[3:38] them
[3:38] and we'll even kill to uphold their
[3:40] error
[3:41] we know there's more than one way to
[3:43] kill you can kill with a sword but you
[3:44] can also kill by destroying one
[3:46] another's influence
[3:49] and that's what you know i think a lot
[3:51] about people that say
[3:52] don't come to this church because of
[3:54] what we teach
[3:55] and they're trying to destroy destroy
[3:58] our influence
[4:05] at the harvest time
[4:07] brother graham said she had a fine
[4:08] education of the truth she didn't know
[4:10] before and it was god's truth
[4:12] but she was dead by breaking the word
[4:15] yeah she got her education all right
[4:18] and you know
[4:19] science tries to
[4:21] tries to prove god by saying well god's
[4:24] got to come our way
[4:25] and that's what that's what education
[4:27] does you know a lot of times when
[4:29] brother brown talks about how education
[4:31] takes you farther from god is because
[4:33] instead of coming to god's provided way
[4:35] they try to say well you got to come our
[4:37] way
[4:38] and we'll set the ground rules
[4:40] if you come our way then we'll accept it
[4:48] and uh i will restore saith the lord
[4:52] brother brown said but through the
[4:53] spirit that he let come upon him you
[4:55] couldn't attach that evil thing of cane
[4:57] upon god
[4:58] so he let the satan's spirit come upon
[5:00] him the spirit of unbelief
[5:06] but every man in this spoken word is the
[5:07] original seed every man no matter
[5:09] whether he's the pope priest bishop
[5:11] whatever he did he is he dies
[5:14] because he's a hybrid that's exactly
[5:17] he was born between satan and eve
[5:19] and they call it whatever you want to it
[5:21] was satan and eve the original word had
[5:23] nothing to do with it
[5:24] the original word was life
[5:27] so it all started because
[5:29] one word taken out
[5:39] let's uh
[5:47] i lost
[5:49] some notes
[5:53] i think i can't skip through reverse two
[6:10] and it's my fault trudy's with me
[6:16] okay
[6:32] and she again bear his brother we're
[6:34] looking at genesis chapter four we're on
[6:36] verse two
[6:38] and she again bear his brother abel and
[6:41] abel was a keeper of the sheep but cain
[6:43] was a timber of the ground
[6:46] and cain's children and i greatly solved
[6:48] them this year cain's children were all
[6:50] smart intelligent scientists all down to
[6:53] the days of noah and seth's children
[6:55] were humble farmers sheep raisers
[6:57] peasants all the way through
[6:59] and god hiding in simplicity he said
[7:00] when these other men just dwell in tents
[7:02] and heard their sheep and rested upon
[7:04] the promises of god see
[7:06] see what it was now just follow the
[7:07] genealogy down through and see if that
[7:09] isn't right
[7:10] they rested upon the promise of god
[7:16] uh
[7:17] now the next
[7:21] sorry i'm going a little slow here to
[7:22] get just get started
[7:24] first three and in process of time it
[7:26] came to pass that cane brawl of the
[7:28] fruit of the ground and offering unto
[7:31] the lord
[7:33] now
[7:35] the thing is when you come to the lord a
[7:38] lot if if you're looking at the
[7:40] the tabernacle when the israelites would
[7:42] come to present their offering to the
[7:44] lord they go into the
[7:46] outer core and then they go into the
[7:48] inner court which represents um
[7:52] coming to church you're fellowshipping
[7:53] with your believers you're doing what
[7:54] god said under the shed blood
[7:57] and
[7:58] a lot of people
[8:00] in in the old testament would kind of
[8:02] think that was the end goal again they
[8:04] forget what the true purpose was was to
[8:06] proceed on into the holy of holies and
[8:09] have fellowship with god
[8:11] and that's really the difference between
[8:12] cain and abel was able wanted fellowship
[8:15] with god and cain had a desire just to
[8:19] just to come to church and
[8:22] present a sacrifice
[8:24] and just kind of that was
[8:26] he he lost sight of
[8:28] what the real goal was was fellowship
[8:29] with god
[8:31] and so when god told when
[8:33] abel and god told him
[8:35] present the sacrifice this you need to
[8:37] do this to come and have fellowship
[8:40] then uh
[8:42] he did like science and said
[8:45] you gotta come my way
[8:47] which is
[8:49] just not right
[8:51] so let's read what brother brown said um
[8:55] making an antidote for sin his father
[8:57] and my mother must have eat fruit as
[8:59] they were taught in that garden
[9:01] now
[9:04] that's how a lot of us were we came
[9:05] through
[9:07] many of you came through denominations
[9:09] or things where you
[9:11] were taught that
[9:12] we taught a lot of things that when the
[9:14] message when you heard the message you
[9:16] received a revelation that pulled you
[9:19] out of that that's how able was when he
[9:21] heard the revelation of god it pulled
[9:23] him up higher than
[9:25] the things that cain was familiar with
[9:27] because they had been taught that it was
[9:29] the fruit right you know i can imagine
[9:31] maybe
[9:32] uh
[9:34] adam and eve were a little bit
[9:35] embarrassed about what happened
[9:37] so they didn't tell them everything that
[9:39] happened in the
[9:40] in the garden everything that happened
[9:42] with the fall
[9:44] so
[9:45] canedin came to all well i'll just bring
[9:48] fruit because that's all i knew but abel
[9:50] got a revelation
[9:52] and so he uh
[9:53] he brought what was required by god and
[9:56] when they came they came to god alone
[9:59] that's how you can't bring your mama and
[10:01] your daddy
[10:02] your pastor you've got to come there's
[10:05] only one door into the holy of holies if
[10:07] you go into that little room you're all
[10:09] by yourself with god
[10:11] it's you and god alone
[10:16] i like this quote tucson
[10:19] thirst this message thirsty priest in
[10:21] tucson
[10:23] now let us look at the thirst and let's
[10:25] see whether actually a thirst is a
[10:26] natural thing
[10:28] i've had people to tell me oh i know i
[10:30] believe it's just for some people to
[10:32] want to be christians
[10:34] oh no that's wrong it's actually
[10:35] something that's associated with every
[10:37] human being
[10:38] and as we're looking through this story
[10:41] pay attention that god
[10:42] called cain he called him and said come
[10:45] and bring your sacrifice
[10:47] and you know a lot of people think
[10:49] that you've got to be
[10:51] uh of us of a certain race certain
[10:53] lineage or a certain genealogy or
[10:56] uh
[10:57] be somehow somehow special but
[11:00] everybody has something in there and
[11:02] that calls him that draws him to worship
[11:05] god
[11:07] he said as long as they are human
[11:10] there's something in them a natural
[11:11] thirst calling out for god somewhere
[11:15] show us the father and he suffices now
[11:17] if an altar is that all that god
[11:19] requires cain was justified
[11:22] and cain made his sacrifice upon the
[11:23] altar is that right well if a sacrifice
[11:26] and an altar is all god wants
[11:28] cain was justified
[11:30] then cain also he built an altar and he
[11:32] worshiped he put a sacrifice on it and
[11:34] he knelt down and worshiped god
[11:36] but god was displeased because he didn't
[11:38] come the right way
[11:49] and the mighty god unveiled before she
[11:50] said is that it is an individual affairs
[11:53] you and god
[11:54] you have to go in not your group not
[11:57] your church not your pastor but it's you
[11:59] who has to go in
[12:01] amen
[12:03] now we talked about verse 4 last time
[12:06] and abel he also brought on the first
[12:08] things of his flock and of the fat
[12:10] thereof and the lord had respect and to
[12:13] abel and to his offering
[12:15] now
[12:16] we we learned last time that
[12:18] what happened was abel offered a burnt
[12:20] offering because it was completely
[12:22] consumed by god and we know there's
[12:23] different kinds of offering the peace
[12:25] offering was consumed offered and
[12:27] consumed by the priest
[12:28] the um sin offering was offered and then
[12:31] taken out of the camp and uh
[12:34] and burned but the burn offering is the
[12:36] only one that was completely consumed
[12:38] and when an israelite came and their
[12:40] burnt offering was received and that was
[12:42] a type that showed to them
[12:44] that they were accepted
[12:46] and that represents the baptism of the
[12:48] holy ghost that represents
[12:50] all of the times that we studied how
[12:52] someone would gideon or elijah would
[12:55] bring an offering an abel and they were
[12:57] accepted now what was being accepted
[12:59] here was abel's faith
[13:02] because he believed god and then
[13:04] when he offered his sacrifice it was
[13:06] completely consumed and everybody around
[13:10] that was watching knew
[13:11] that that was the right way to approach
[13:13] to god
[13:14] it was it was public
[13:16] and um
[13:18] it wasn't something he didn't
[13:22] i i just uh printed out a little quote
[13:24] that i found on the internet when i was
[13:26] studying this that uh
[13:29] kind of tell some more about the burnt
[13:31] offering the type involved and complete
[13:32] burning that self-manifests it is
[13:35] consumption of sin nature
[13:38] this is the great promise and prophecy
[13:40] and requirement of every form of the
[13:41] truth the destruction of the body of sin
[13:44] and we were talking about that too how
[13:48] the earth has to be completely cleansed
[13:51] by of sin by the fire of god and our
[13:54] body is going to be cleansed by
[13:56] the rapture
[13:58] by the uh cleansing power of god
[14:01] and it completely destroys sin and
[14:03] that's what the burnt offering is a type
[14:04] of the sin totally destroyed
[14:11] so i wanted to just kind of branch off
[14:13] of that
[14:14] and we're almost out of time we're about
[14:16] halfway through so i got next next
[14:18] sunday too so maybe we'll run over
[14:20] into that but um
[14:22] i got to thinking about how
[14:24] the the burnt offering was public
[14:27] and how cain saw kane could see
[14:31] what had happened so i i wanted to kind
[14:33] of talk about how
[14:34] that this message was also vindicated
[14:37] publicly
[14:38] and when
[14:40] when
[14:41] abel's sacrifice was vindicated it
[14:42] vindicated
[14:44] the message abel's message was you need
[14:47] to blame bring a blood sacrifice
[14:50] and it also vindicated him because he
[14:53] believed it
[14:56] so let's start off
[14:59] with the pillar of fire
[15:01] and think about
[15:03] how
[15:05] imagine how rahab when she was looking
[15:07] out of the windows of jericho
[15:09] she was looking at the children of
[15:10] israel coming through the wilderness
[15:12] the first thing she saw was the pillar
[15:14] of fire
[15:21] brother brendon said now look he said
[15:23] i'll send you a sign
[15:24] there will be a pillar of fire will lead
[15:26] you all the way
[15:28] you just follow it it'll take you that's
[15:29] right and they got right up there and
[15:31] the pillar of fire
[15:33] turned into a man he said i am the
[15:35] captain of the host of the lord said
[15:36] we've come this far now let's go
[15:38] on now um let me let me uh before i get
[15:42] into some of these quotes let me
[15:45] let me just kind of retell
[15:47] some of the the times that the pillar of
[15:49] fire appeared in brother reynolds
[15:50] ministry you know what appeared in his
[15:52] birth on april 6 1909 and then it
[15:54] appeared on the ohio river
[15:57] to announce that he was going to
[15:59] forerun
[16:01] the
[16:02] full run the message you know message
[16:04] before run the second coming
[16:07] and then it appeared in houston coliseum
[16:10] when uh
[16:11] reverend best decided he was gonna he
[16:13] didn't like the healing campaign
[16:16] so he wanted to have a little bit of an
[16:17] argument
[16:19] with and uh brother bossert went to
[16:21] defend brother branham his brother
[16:22] branham didn't want to go
[16:24] and um
[16:26] finally they got
[16:31] brother branham the holy spirit told him
[16:33] it was okay to go down and go down to
[16:35] the platform and when he went down
[16:38] they had hired a photographer
[16:41] with mr ayers to take pictures of
[16:43] reverend best when he shook his fist
[16:45] under
[16:46] the buzzer's face
[16:47] and mr acres was not at all in favor of
[16:50] billy branham he said uh
[16:53] i think i've got a quote in here
[16:54] somewhere
[16:56] this is what mr ayers said
[17:00] brandon puts on a show
[17:03] somehow he never gets around to the
[17:04] cripples and the persons who have
[17:05] arthritis
[17:06] he simply hypnotizes his audience
[17:09] he was not in favor of billy graham at
[17:11] all
[17:12] so
[17:13] when he took all the pictures of of
[17:15] reverend best
[17:17] and he the last one he took was a
[17:19] brother brown when he took him to be
[17:20] developed
[17:22] all of them came out black except for
[17:24] the last one which was a brother branham
[17:26] and the brother branham said right
[17:28] before they took that picture he could
[17:29] hear the pillar of fire coming in with a
[17:31] rush a rushing swing
[17:33] and so they took that picture and the
[17:35] pillar of fire showed up on that last
[17:37] negative and they took it to be analyzed
[17:39] by uh this man who contracted out to the
[17:41] fbi george lacy and he said i can
[17:44] absolutely uh say that it was it was a
[17:47] light it struck the negative there was
[17:48] no light behind
[17:49] the the picture
[17:52] so um
[17:53] when i was 10 years old we went on a
[17:56] trip to the library of congress
[17:58] my family took us on a little field trip
[18:00] and we went to the
[18:01] hall of religious heart to see that
[18:03] picture
[18:05] and you know you'd expect when you go to
[18:06] the hall of religious art it's such a
[18:08] big place that you have to go down
[18:10] we asked them where is the pillar the
[18:12] picture of the pillar fire but around
[18:14] them you'd have to go down
[18:16] all these long rows of pictures and
[18:18] different things to find that they have
[18:20] to find and hunt it out in a little a
[18:22] little spot in the corner
[18:24] so we came up to the desk
[18:25] and said where she asked us what we're
[18:27] looking for and we told her
[18:29] and she said here it is
[18:31] i just pulled it up right there because
[18:33] so many people come came to look for
[18:36] that picture
[18:37] that they had it right there
[18:39] and also
[18:40] it came up missing so many times that
[18:42] they frequently had to reorder who else
[18:44] people would take it down
[18:46] so this is the pillar of fire is not a
[18:49] it was not done in private it was a very
[18:51] public thing
[18:53] everybody knows about it
[18:58] and it vindicates the messenger it also
[18:59] vindicates the believer because the
[19:01] pillar of fire somebody
[19:03] it's not something right you have to
[19:05] have an experience with the pillar of
[19:06] fire pillar fire has to come in you and
[19:08] then when it comes in you it leads you
[19:11] because
[19:16] he said
[19:18] when the comforter comforters come
[19:20] then i will send them to you from the
[19:22] father
[19:23] even the spirit of truth was proceedeth
[19:25] from the father he shall testify on me
[19:28] and he said i have yet many things to
[19:30] say unto you in john 16
[19:32] but you cannot bear them i'll be when he
[19:34] the spirit of truth is come he will
[19:36] guide you into all truth for he shall
[19:38] not speak for himself but whatsoever he
[19:40] shall hear that shall he speak
[19:42] and he will show you things to come
[19:46] you know
[19:48] when
[19:49] jesus asks
[19:51] peter uh who do you say that i am
[19:54] and he said thou art
[19:56] the heart of the christ
[19:58] jesus said
[19:59] blessed art thy son of arjuna for flesh
[20:01] and blood hath not revealed it unto thee
[20:03] but my father is in heaven
[20:06] it's the pillar of fire that leads us
[20:07] and reveals these things to us
[20:10] romans 8 14 for as many as are led by
[20:12] the spirit of god they are the sons of
[20:14] god
[20:17] let's read some more what he said he
[20:19] cares do you care we're almost out of
[20:21] time
[20:22] he's so cared even for a woman that was
[20:24] an outsider not an israelite
[20:27] she didn't belong to the group she was
[20:29] an outsider presbyterian methodist or
[20:31] something she was on the other side
[20:33] when she heard her name was rahab
[20:36] she was living she was a harlot but when
[20:37] she heard how god was in a pillar of
[20:39] fire and was leading them she she said
[20:41] let called out to god and she showed
[20:43] mercy to the supplies that had come to
[20:45] look out the land
[20:46] and because she cared for her and her
[20:48] and her people god cared for her
[20:51] and so much to this harlot that would
[20:52] give her life to christ to the cause
[20:54] because she had seen this sign of a
[20:56] supernatural god
[20:58] and she served her gods right in her own
[21:00] denomination when she seen this great
[21:03] supernatural sign she cried out and
[21:05] asked for mercy and for mercy for her
[21:07] family
[21:09] and god so cared for her that the whole
[21:11] city lapped down one on top of the other
[21:12] but there wasn't one rock moved on her
[21:14] house he cares
[21:23] the third exodus noticed the pillar of
[21:25] fire that called them out led into the
[21:26] promised land under the anointing of a
[21:28] prophet a pillar of fire that they can
[21:30] look at led them to the promised land
[21:32] under anointed prophet and they
[21:33] constantly turn them down that right
[21:38] that let every man's word be a lie and
[21:40] mind the truth come out of it what do
[21:42] you know the same pillar of fire the
[21:44] same anointing spirit leading to the
[21:45] promised land
[21:48] and the third exodus this great angel of
[21:50] the covenant jesus christ in the form of
[21:52] god thought it not robbery but become
[21:54] equal with god now he's a pillar of fire
[21:57] in the same form that he was back there
[21:58] bringing that first texas
[22:00] bringing the second exodus and here he
[22:03] is with the third exodus
[22:06] i was thinking about how
[22:08] i read i don't think i have this quote
[22:10] what brother brendan said with paul one
[22:11] day he met a pillar of fire
[22:14] and what happened next was a pillar of
[22:16] fire led him to a prophet
[22:18] the prophet taught him how to be
[22:19] baptized and what he needed to do
[22:23] amen
[22:24] so if the pillar of fire leads us to the
[22:26] word
[22:27] you know the magi too they saw three
[22:29] stars he said they saw three stars and
[22:31] they came together into one star over
[22:33] the world
[22:34] they were led
[22:35] out of the east to the word
[22:38] think about simeon and anna anna was
[22:40] blind in the temple when when they uh
[22:43] brought she used to be dedicated
[22:45] she couldn't even see but she was led
[22:47] straight to the word
[22:55] a time of decision it's in the religious
[22:57] hall of art in washington dc copyrighted
[22:59] the only supernatural being was ever
[23:01] scientifically proven to be photographed
[23:06] he said i come from god the pillar of
[23:08] fire i returned back to god
[23:10] on the road to damascus paul met him and
[23:12] he was stricken down a great light that
[23:14] put his eyes out and said saul saul why
[23:16] persecuted thou me
[23:18] he said who are you said i'm jesus
[23:21] and here he is with his picture taken
[23:23] among us
[23:24] now cameras don't take psychology the
[23:26] mechanical eye of the camera
[23:28] there's something struck the lens
[23:30] make your decision now if you believe it
[23:32] if he will speak to this young woman
[23:36] just a few more quotes and then one
[23:39] we got the vindicated word of god here
[23:41] vindicating proven by the spirit that
[23:42] he's received us and give us the baptism
[23:44] of the holy ghost we are baptized into
[23:46] the name of jesus christ
[23:48] the same gospel the same signs the same
[23:50] wonders the same ministry even the same
[23:52] pillar of fire visible before the signs
[23:54] and wonders
[23:55] there is not an excuse nowhere
[23:58] so that's where i'll stop today the next
[24:01] thing that rahab saw behind the pillar
[24:03] of fire was the ark of the covenant
[24:06] i'll leave you with that thought
