[39:58] of what Christmas really means to them
[40:01] it's not a Christ Mass it's not a a time
[40:04] of the world but it's about Jesus Christ
[40:07] and what he gave for us and they sang
[40:09] today and said what they believe you

[40:36] Ephesians wherein he hath abounded
[40:38] toward us in all wisdom and Prudence
[40:40] having made known unto us the mystery of
[40:43] his will according to his good pleasure
[40:45] which he hath purposed in himself that
[40:47] in the dispensation of the fullness of
[40:50] times he might gather together in one
[40:53] all things in Christ both which are in
[40:55] heaven and which are on on Earth were
[40:59] even in him all right now we go to acts
[41:04] three verse 22 and 23 to get our thought
[41:09] from for Moses say truly said unto the
[41:12] fathers a prophet shall the Lord your
[41:15] God raise up unto you of your own
[41:17] Brethren like unto me him shall ye hear
[41:22] in all things whatsoever he shall say
[41:25] unto you and it shall come to pass that
[41:28] every soul which not will not hear that
[41:31] Prophet shall be destroyed from among
[41:34] the people you may be seated the Lord
[41:36] add his Blessing to the reading of the
[41:39] word and we'll try not to be too long
[41:41] but we're still wanting to I cut this
[41:46] things down that originally had to
[41:48] continue on and we're going to try to uh
[41:52] you know bring our thought to you in a
[41:55] hurry and then get on end with the
[41:57] the time and together now we're talking
[42:02] about changing
[42:05] dispensations and what we're dealing
[42:08] with really now is in the point we went
[42:11] from the dispensation of son of man and
[42:15] you know coming down through and
[42:17] bringing him all the way from the Old
[42:18] Testament into the New Testament and the
[42:21] life of Christ trying not to spend so
[42:24] much time on each one but to get a point
[42:27] all right then we in the last message we
[42:30] begin to talk about coming from we went
[42:33] from son of
[42:35] man and how that he was crucified he
[42:39] gave his life that was the reason you
[42:40] and I can be saved is the son of man had
[42:43] to give his life that was the only way
[42:46] the Holy Ghost could ever come back upon
[42:48] the people because it was bottled up in
[42:51] him all right and but then when he gave
[42:54] his life it released that life to come
[42:56] back on the day P cost into the bride of
[42:58] Christ okay now then coming into and we
[43:02] were dealing the last one see brother R
[43:04] said in the seven Church ages you're
[43:06] dealing with Son of God all right which
[43:09] is the holy spirit it's the Holy Ghost
[43:13] dispensation dealing with Son of God all
[43:16] right now I told you then that we and I
[43:19] tried to cover a little bit but I'm
[43:22] trying to get a point across that in
[43:25] this dispensation now when he was here
[43:27] as son of man Son of God was living in
[43:31] that flesh that's that's fine we know
[43:34] that all right he you could be calling
[43:36] they did the son of David and all that
[43:39] but that hadn't come forth into
[43:41] manifestation right because the Holy
[43:43] Ghost had not been given because Jesus
[43:45] had not been crucified according to the
[43:47] scripture or glorified all right see
[43:50] then he comes from son of man to Son of
[43:53] God in the New Birth all right and he
[43:57] comes into church ages as Son of God not
[44:00] son of man now he's the same God all the
[44:03] time amen when he was here on Earth he
[44:05] was son of man Son of God Son of David
[44:09] Alpha and Omega Rose of Sharon Lil of
[44:11] the valley you know the lamb the the
[44:14] anything that you would want to bring
[44:16] out he was all of
[44:19] that right but yet it was what was being
[44:23] made known for the time because as I
[44:26] said there was no way for the life to
[44:28] come into the church except it be the
[44:31] fact that the son of man had to yield up
[44:34] that life it had to come out of that
[44:36] flesh it couldn't just drop down on
[44:38] people and you know and do because he
[44:41] had already said what he was going to do
[44:44] all right and see then that would make
[44:47] him to where that he would come into the
[44:49] church on the day of Pentecost all right
[44:51] we haven't dealt we will take one more
[44:53] message the Lord willing try to pull
[44:55] over a little Sun Monday uh you know
[44:59] this next Sunday to pick up something in
[45:01] that to dealing with the church ages but
[45:05] just think about it he's not when he
[45:07] started the church age on the day of
[45:09] Pentecost he didn't start it off as son
[45:11] of man that's where he asked the
[45:13] disciples who do Man say that I the son
[45:15] of man
[45:16] am all right he said they said uh uh you
[45:20] know we don't know he said finally
[45:22] evidently brother Brown said he looked
[45:23] right straight maybe at Peter but he
[45:25] said who the man who do you say that I
[45:28] amen he said Thou Art the Christ the son
[45:31] of the Living God meaning you are the
[45:34] Creator God the Eternal God the Son of
[45:38] God you are all of that Old Testament
[45:41] manifestation coming forth into you know
[45:45] your life and and what you are he was
[45:48] recognizing that but he wasn't
[45:49] recognizing the part called son of man
[45:53] because that was already you know that
[45:56] was a say that it would not be through
[46:00] the church ages as son of man now not
[46:02] meaning he's not the same God right it
[46:06] doesn't matter what age you're in he's
[46:07] the same God but it's what he's doing
[46:10] that's why we're talking about
[46:11] dispensation it's the way God is
[46:14] dealing so he dealt with man as son of
[46:17] man he could heal the sick he could
[46:19] raise the dead but he could not give
[46:21] eternal life to anyone while he was
[46:24] standing there alive that was a dis
[46:26] dispensation all right now then when he
[46:30] gave his life it could release it and
[46:33] eternal life could come into the people
[46:35] but it would be called Son of God
[46:37] dispensation or Holy Ghost
[46:40] dispensation all right and doing that
[46:42] then it would come forth to be something
[46:45] would have to happen because in this now
[46:48] watch my point while he was here as son
[46:50] of man he was the son of God but he
[46:53] wasn't manifesting
[46:55] that are you with
[46:58] he was just manifesting son of man but
[47:00] in this
[47:02] dispensation the last days and he starts
[47:05] this dispensation all specifically as
[47:08] Son of
[47:09] God Holy Spirit dwelling in the people
[47:13] the new birth all right but in this age
[47:16] only you got an
[47:18] overlap we'll get to that and pick up a
[47:21] few statements to bring it along but in
[47:24] this age he's manifesting he he can be
[47:26] manifesting himself right
[47:29] now as Son of
[47:31] God because he's given salvation to
[47:34] people right anywhere Sal is salvation
[47:37] still going on he's the son of God he's
[47:39] not the son of man in that point he's
[47:42] the son of God salvation all right but
[47:45] then to some that are in the message and
[47:47] beginning to catch on to the message and
[47:50] realize what's taking place then it can
[47:52] be moved into and understand the son of
[47:55] man
[47:57] all right now that's what we want to
[47:58] make sure to emphasize
[48:01] today the point of what brother brandham
[48:04] was not the son of
[48:07] man if you make him that you're making
[48:09] him
[48:10] God now how close that
[48:13] was it was close because it's God living
[48:17] in the man
[48:20] right all right but that get to point of
[48:23] what we're talking about during the time
[48:26] of the Holy Ghost
[48:29] dispensation all right a dispensation
[48:32] starting off at the day Pentecost it
[48:35] started off as Son of God it comes down
[48:37] through seven Church ages and right here
[48:40] in the last Church
[48:43] age right in the last Church age you're
[48:47] going to see that the Son of God is
[48:50] still there giving life to those who
[48:52] receive life right but to those those
[48:57] that are in the word he's beginning to
[49:00] change
[49:01] dispensations and will be made known as
[49:04] the son of
[49:05] man all right now to be able to do that
[49:11] now we'll cover this in a minute but
[49:12] just don't don't get too
[49:14] excited to be able to do
[49:17] that would be just like it was back
[49:20] there now listen back there you could
[49:24] not come from
[49:27] as the holy ghost coming into
[49:30] church he had to come son of man to make
[49:33] a way all right
[49:37] now but then it was the Holy Ghost in
[49:40] him that was released to come back okay
[49:43] now in the end
[49:45] time it's going to go from Son of God
[49:49] Holy Ghost new
[49:50] birth to son of
[49:54] man all right now for that that to
[49:57] happen go check and see
[50:00] what for that to
[50:06] happen it's going to have to
[50:09] be that in
[50:12] between the manifestation of Son of
[50:15] God over into son of
[50:19] man that a prophet's going to have to
[50:22] come go back Dar was a prophet but now
[50:25] he was more than a prophet ET but it's
[50:28] going to be that a dispensation has to
[50:30] come into being about son of man and to
[50:32] do that is going to mean that he has to
[50:36] come to fulfill the
[50:39] scripture Luke 17:30 Revelations 10:7
[50:43] all of those scriptures is to be
[50:44] fulfilled in our day all right so it
[50:48] meant they would have to be a
[50:52] day when God would come on the scene
[50:56] through a
[50:57] prophet and make a
[51:00] way that the son of man could come into
[51:04] view remember we'll get to it in a
[51:07] minute the seven angels not the son of
[51:09] man he's revealing the son of
[51:12] man but you can't make him the son of
[51:14] man see you're making him deity you're
[51:16] going into the wrong thing all right we
[51:19] see then what you're what we've got to
[51:21] do then is to see in this
[51:24] day is the only day that you see the
[51:26] overlap between Son of God and son of
[51:30] man that both dispensations can be
[51:33] here do you understand what I'm saying
[51:36] to those that are coming into the
[51:37] message those hearing the word those
[51:39] that are getting saved today he's Son of
[51:42] God the baptism of the Holy Ghost all
[51:46] right right CU he's not the son of man
[51:49] to
[51:50] them he's Son of God right what I but in
[51:54] this age now is going to go from Son of
[51:59] God to son of man okay because he cannot
[52:04] go remember how we were trying to
[52:06] express it he can't go to the Millennium
[52:09] and Son of David until he comes back to
[52:13] Earth because David is a rain on
[52:17] earth right a rain on
[52:21] Earth okay and being a rain on Earth it
[52:24] means you're going to have to come back
[52:29] a son of
[52:31] man now I I preached this 1969 so it's
[52:37] not a new thing for me to talk about
[52:39] it's great glorious to see it
[52:41] unfold but you see brother brandham
[52:44] cannot be the son of
[52:47] man but as part of the Bride of Jesus
[52:50] Christ The Bride of Jesus Christ will be
[52:54] the son of man
[52:58] or there ain't going to be no
[53:01] Rapture see I kept saying it over and
[53:05] over what why does he have to come back
[53:09] as son of
[53:10] man I that's that question over and over
[53:13] why did he have to come back as son of
[53:17] man see it's more than just say well a
[53:20] Propet would
[53:23] come right
[53:26] it's more more to this than to just talk
[53:31] about well we've had a
[53:33] prophet thank God because without that
[53:37] if you don't get nothing else get
[53:40] this as it was that God Son of Man had
[53:43] to come before the Son of God could come
[53:45] into
[53:47] being before it can go from Son of God
[53:50] the son of
[53:51] man it's going to have to be that God
[53:54] would send us a prophet in the last days
[53:58] all right now if that's not giving him
[54:01] the honor and the
[54:02] praise I don't know what you're going to
[54:04] do with it cuz you're going to come up
[54:07] and say well now it's this or it's that
[54:08] I'm giving him the greatest honor and
[54:10] praise there
[54:12] is as John the Baptist come and what was
[54:17] his
[54:18] purpose what was the purpose of John the
[54:20] Baptist you remember the prophets buildt
[54:23] a body John the Baptist come to
[54:25] introduce the head right
[54:26] which was Christ okay what greater honor
[54:30] could it be than for Malachi 4 to come
[54:32] into being to where brother randam would
[54:36] stand and point to Jesus
[54:42] Christ but then he'd show you where he's
[54:46] at because that's what a lot of people
[54:48] think see a lot of people think it like
[54:51] this you know they got the quote where
[54:52] it said all God was poured into Christ
[54:54] all Christ in the church you know Etc
[54:56] that's plenty of them but see a lot of
[54:58] the the way they do it in the message
[55:00] today all God was he poured into Christ
[55:02] all Christ was poured into brother
[55:04] brandom brother brandom died and took it
[55:05] with him we ain't got nothing to do we
[55:07] just hang around wait till the bus pulls
[55:09] up well now if that's what you
[55:12] think I mean why come to
[55:16] church you understand I'm
[55:19] blame if that's the way you think then
[55:22] why go to church anywhere
[55:27] go home sit
[55:29] down and just wait on the
[55:32] bus but evidently that's not exactly the
[55:36] way that we think or at least it's not
[55:38] the way I
[55:42] think and then that puts it to the basis
[55:46] that the honor is put in the right
[55:49] place what could be a greater honor that
[55:51] brother Ram would
[55:53] say that he was to introduce Jesus
[55:57] Christ to the
[56:01] world and to show you where I'm going if
[56:04] you don't know you're in bad shape
[56:05] anyway but to show you where I'm going
[56:08] he said this messenger would be poting
[56:10] to the
[56:11] skies pointing to a word born bride you
[56:17] remember that
[56:18] statement pointing to a word born
[56:22] bride somebody's got to finish this up
[56:25] there is a
[56:27] dispensation that you're not
[56:32] counting there is a
[56:35] dispensation that the people of this
[56:37] message has never caught on to yet oh
[56:39] yeah brother so and so so I'm as honest
[56:42] as I can be now you get exal say I'm
[56:44] exalted do what you want to I don't care
[56:46] I don't get no money out of it anyway
[56:48] don't make no difference to
[56:53] me see I'm pointing to one thing
[56:58] the word of the
[57:00] Lord there is a
[57:02] dispensation that is not
[57:07] finished Mary only spoke of
[57:10] it you remember I ask you because we're
[57:12] going into that next the Lord willing I
[57:15] ask you to read Masterpiece seed not air
[57:17] with a
[57:18] shook brother R says Mary was not the
[57:23] seed
[57:24] right okay who's the
[57:28] seed that's all I've asked who's the
[57:30] seed well brother Randon was the
[57:34] seed he's part of
[57:37] it because the seed's the word that's
[57:39] right without him there wouldn't be no
[57:42] me and you right how much more honor
[57:44] could you give to a prophet than to say
[57:49] our total dependence is upon what he has
[57:51] brought unto
[57:52] us but not your ideas and my ideas
[57:55] that's right amen when I begin to put my
[57:57] ideas on you come and tell me where my
[57:59] now don't come with baby thing don't
[58:01] come flabber in with baby talk you know
[58:03] when you said this and you said that and
[58:05] you said this and you said that if you
[58:07] can't listen to what I'm
[58:09] saying then you're in bad shape that's
[58:12] right but to try to say it the way God
[58:15] gives it then if you don't listen you're
[58:18] in bad shape that's your
[58:21] choice but you see he was down through
[58:24] seven Church ages it it was Son of
[58:27] God the seventh Church age is still
[58:31] going
[58:32] on you say well I got where the Prophet
[58:35] said to seven Church age end all right I
[58:36] got where he said it's not ended now are
[58:39] you going to throw quotes with me or you
[58:41] going to be sensible and sit down and
[58:45] listen the bride is called out of the
[58:50] age right so as far as the bride is
[58:53] concerned the age is over but listen
[58:57] the bride was called out of every
[59:00] age every age the bride was not in the
[59:04] age you can't put her in the age she's
[59:07] in the Holy Ghost I'm quoting brother
[59:10] random she's called out Luther Wesley
[59:14] all of them irenius Paul Martin Columba
[59:18] all of them none of those
[59:22] ages was in the age of the island where
[59:24] they were living they were called out of
[59:27] that age and to the bride now you tell
[59:29] me if that ain't
[59:32] right well where are we called
[59:37] too we got to be called out of the
[59:40] age was you listening Sunday when I was
[59:43] trying or there the other day when I was
[59:44] trying to
[59:46] bring see when Jesus was crucified back
[59:49] there the Bible said we got to go out
[59:51] unto
[59:54] him he he was crucified outside the
[59:58] gate and we got to go outside of
[1:00:04] denominationalism to be in
[1:00:07] him but see the last we were talking
[1:00:09] about what that he was put out of the
[1:00:13] age this is the only age we read it this
[1:00:16] is the only age that God was put outside
[1:00:18] of he's standing at the door knocking
[1:00:19] trying to get back into his church ain't
[1:00:22] that the most miserable pitiful
[1:00:23] situation you could think about that the
[1:00:26] greatest religious Society that's ever
[1:00:28] existed in the
[1:00:31] world is in the land
[1:00:35] today there's more Bibles today there's
[1:00:38] more churches there's more people in
[1:00:39] churches there's more percentage wise
[1:00:41] that has ever
[1:00:44] been and there are constantly more
[1:00:46] churches forming forming when in brother
[1:00:49] R's day there was was
[1:00:51] 969 now there's thousands of churches
[1:00:58] formed more people going to church today
[1:01:01] and
[1:01:03] ever in the RO most religious time that
[1:01:06] has ever
[1:01:09] been yet God is outside the church
[1:01:11] according to the scripture well I just
[1:01:13] can't understand that because God's in
[1:01:15] there you don't understand anointed ones
[1:01:17] then for
[1:01:22] certain so you don't follow the point
[1:01:25] you don't listen to the
[1:01:27] prophet he was he was put out before

[1:02:23] some of these dying early and going on
[1:02:26] so you think I'm throwing off on them
[1:02:27] what if they were ahead of
[1:02:29] you and you ain't never got to where
[1:02:32] they were that's the way I
[1:02:35] think so you remember but they're
[1:02:38] waiting on you to come to the place to
[1:02:40] draw them out I'm not de christianizing
[1:02:42] anybody they reached their place that
[1:02:44] was all they could do right when you and
[1:02:47] I reach our place we must die and go by
[1:02:49] the
[1:02:50] grave and somebody's not going to do it
[1:02:52] they're going to be changed well what's
[1:02:54] going to cause that change
[1:03:00] oh we're all got to die I give you a
[1:03:02] quote from R Brown we all got to
[1:03:04] die right you ever heard the message you
[1:03:08] heard that right he said we're all going
[1:03:10] to
[1:03:13] die but then he speak speaks of a
[1:03:17] mystery that we don't all have to
[1:03:20] die see you put it in there and you make
[1:03:22] me saying things that I've not said I
[1:03:25] can't help that God showed me 40
[1:03:27] something years ago that the biggest
[1:03:28] portion of people this message would die
[1:03:30] and go by the
[1:03:31] grave I can't I may be one of them I
[1:03:35] have no
[1:03:37] problem I'm not de christianizing
[1:03:39] anybody I'm honoring
[1:03:41] them they've reached their place do you
[1:03:45] understand what I'm saying
[1:03:47] yes evidently you and I haven't reached
[1:03:50] our place right
[1:03:53] oh we're still alive
[1:03:56] that's right is that enough
[1:04:00] yes so don't throw and make me say
[1:04:03] something I'm not
[1:04:04] saying I've said it 40 something years
[1:04:06] why would I back off
[1:04:10] now because it's the truth
[1:04:13] yes but did you understand what I'm
[1:04:16] talking about yes Sunday there on it
[1:04:20] that he was put out of the
[1:04:23] church as the son of God
[1:04:29] that's the hardest thing probably for
[1:04:30] the human mind to comprehend how that
[1:04:33] God can be put out of this church right
[1:04:35] here totally outside the door knocking
[1:04:37] and Us in here screaming and hollering
[1:04:39] worshiping and praising Jesus
[1:04:46] Christ
[1:04:50] right what was put out the
[1:04:53] word we'll get to it what happened
[1:04:56] cankerworm palmerworm Locust
[1:05:03] caterpillar but remember that was
[1:05:05] Lutheran Wesley in
[1:05:09] Pentecost
[1:05:11] right and then you got the word to be
[1:05:16] formed see he never was in the age may I
[1:05:20] quote brother Brandon you don't listen
[1:05:21] to the quotes that you're reading
[1:05:28] under that message of can wor pal wor
[1:05:31] caterpillar and all you know what he
[1:05:33] said he said the Holy Ghost has been put
[1:05:36] out of the church for
[1:05:40] 2,000
[1:05:42] years do you believe him to say that
[1:05:45] I'll be glad to get it for you or I
[1:05:48] wouldn't make the statement I not that
[1:05:50] stupid dumb
[1:05:54] yeah now if he was put out of the church
[1:05:56] for 2,000 years do you realize what that
[1:05:59] means that means he never worked in the
[1:06:01] church the way he wanted
[1:06:04] to now you go with him you say you
[1:06:07] believe him but do you believe him I
[1:06:10] believe him till he make something like
[1:06:12] that and I don't understand what he's
[1:06:13] saying oh that's a good excuse ain't
[1:06:17] it brother hell you just you just
[1:06:20] confuse me no I ain't confusing nobody
[1:06:22] I'm exposing confusion
[1:06:27] he was put out of the church when it
[1:06:29] come on the day on theusa Street
[1:06:33] 1906 they started immediately
[1:06:36] denominating brother renom never come on
[1:06:38] the scene until at least you got admit
[1:06:40] it was in the say 30 or something when
[1:06:42] he started preaching 33 is basically
[1:06:44] when he come on
[1:06:48] through you don't have no records until
[1:06:50] on up into
[1:06:52] 47 but we know he was back there
[1:06:54] preaching
[1:06:58] see God had done been put out of the
[1:06:59] church if you can't go home pick one of
[1:07:01] your older T and listen to brother
[1:07:03] around screaming and hollering where
[1:07:05] Pentecost
[1:07:07] failed he said you've put him out of
[1:07:09] your
[1:07:11] church oh they want him there to heal
[1:07:13] the sick they want him there to to
[1:07:16] MoneyWise they want him because that's
[1:07:18] what they wanted while Jesus was
[1:07:22] alive well I just don't understand it
[1:07:24] because I've been to them Church ches
[1:07:25] and they just shout Glory
[1:07:28] Hallelujah praise God I'm not saying
[1:07:32] they're not praising God that's where
[1:07:35] you don't
[1:07:38] understand you're thinking that
[1:07:39] everything that don't agree with this
[1:07:41] message is dying and going to
[1:07:44] hell come on I can quote with you I know
[1:07:47] what the message say word rejectors go
[1:07:49] to
[1:07:50] hell but what if you ain't never heard
[1:07:52] the message you can't reject it
[1:07:57] there's a lot of people in this world
[1:07:59] never heard this message they can't
[1:08:00] reject the
[1:08:03] message are you going to make them all
[1:08:09] lost just because he's put out of the
[1:08:11] church where was he at he was in the
[1:08:15] church how was he put out of the church
[1:08:17] and him in the
[1:08:18] church it was the word that was put out
[1:08:22] not the Holy
[1:08:23] Spirit they want the Holy Spirit they
[1:08:26] want the healings and signs and wers and
[1:08:28] to do that R around and said they take
[1:08:29] so much of the word and it'll work
[1:08:31] that's
[1:08:34] right like I said you tell me and
[1:08:36] brother rown standing up there preaching
[1:08:38] his heart out crying as he was preaching
[1:08:40] to the people and said you've turned God
[1:08:42] down he's outside the church and they
[1:08:45] get up and worship and scream and Glory
[1:08:47] Hallelujah and him even come right
[1:08:49] behind them and say look there's
[1:08:51] somebody receiving the holy ghost look
[1:08:52] he's from right over here watch that
[1:08:53] brother it's coming across this way
[1:08:56] and he's got through preaching the
[1:08:57] message that God was outside the
[1:09:01] church would you explain that to
[1:09:07] me the only way I know it can be
[1:09:09] explained is
[1:09:13] what he's not there as the person of the
[1:09:18] word that has been put out he's there as
[1:09:21] the anointing of the Holy Ghost because
[1:09:24] of the anointing in the end
[1:09:30] time don't For Heaven's Sake don't make
[1:09:33] light of any of their worship and their
[1:09:36] doing because remember if that is the
[1:09:39] Holy Ghost that's causing them to do
[1:09:41] that you've got problems with
[1:09:45] God so don't make fun of them give them
[1:09:49] their place and leave it
[1:09:52] alone but find Our Place
[1:09:58] that's all I've ever preached I sitting
[1:10:00] last night or this morning sitting there
[1:10:02] crying thinking about it all I've ever
[1:10:04] tried to do is just preach this
[1:10:07] message to try to get the people to see
[1:10:09] Jesus
[1:10:15] Christ but you see they'll just turn you
[1:10:17] down and walk
[1:10:20] away and you preaching your heart out
[1:10:24] and then you tell them so come and tell
[1:10:25] me before you leave but they get outside
[1:10:28] the door and leave and go somewhere
[1:10:29] there then they start yakity yaking
[1:10:31] don't they if you like one brother said
[1:10:33] I'll never one brother told me in the
[1:10:35] office he said I'll never say anything
[1:10:37] against
[1:10:40] you took him about five or six months
[1:10:43] and this is what he said he said if you
[1:10:45] want to know why I left he said I'll
[1:10:47] never tell nobody why I'm leaving or
[1:10:49] anything it's right there in the
[1:10:53] office he come back and he said if you
[1:10:56] want to know why I left the church call
[1:10:57] me and I'll tell
[1:11:02] you well you know what I thought about
[1:11:04] calling him cuz I'd like to know why he
[1:11:09] left cuz he told me that he'd never do
[1:11:12] nothing like
[1:11:14] that you see you you you get when I do
[1:11:17] that you get to thinking you're just
[1:11:18] trying to be exalted whatever I just
[1:11:20] tried to stay with the
[1:11:22] truth is it the truth go was put out of
[1:11:26] the church before he ever even got into
[1:11:28] the church enough to get it
[1:11:34] started look at the Oneness people that
[1:11:37] started before brother random come along
[1:11:38] that was a move of God wasn't
[1:11:41] it somewhere about 1914 right in there
[1:11:46] 12 something it's your Oneness begin to
[1:11:48] come on the
[1:11:49] scene and they was throwing Rotten
[1:11:51] Tomatoes at them who church people
[1:11:59] church people were throwing Tomatoes at
[1:12:01] those that started believing the truth
[1:12:04] of
[1:12:07] Oneness he had already been put out of
[1:12:10] the
[1:12:12] church no wonder they couldn't follow
[1:12:14] brother random then when he come forth
[1:12:16] as to speaking of son of
[1:12:18] man they couldn't follow
[1:12:21] that and when God began to do the signs
[1:12:23] and wonders oh yeah they wanted to with
[1:12:25] the signs and wonders
[1:12:27] right oh yeah they Rejoice over the
[1:12:29] signs and wonders oh
[1:12:32] yes but when you begin to say I and my
[1:12:35] father
[1:12:37] one then what did they
[1:12:39] say well you went too far now if he just
[1:12:42] have
[1:12:43] stayed if he' just have stayed who was
[1:12:46] the brother that went up to him cuz he
[1:12:48] never really said it but we ought to
[1:12:50] know who it was who was a brother that
[1:12:52] went up to brother brandham and said
[1:12:53] brother brandham I want to pray for you
[1:12:56] to cast that demon off of
[1:12:59] you cuz you were just supposed to pray
[1:13:01] for the sick and do these
[1:13:04] things who was that
[1:13:09] brother well you know evidently he
[1:13:11] didn't believe brother Brandon
[1:13:15] right is it
[1:13:17] true see the son of man never even had
[1:13:20] an opportunity in the churches because
[1:13:22] he was put out as Son of God
[1:13:26] then when brother Brandon began to talk
[1:13:28] about son of man they couldn't follow
[1:13:31] it it took him 30 something years to be
[1:13:34] able to preach the statute of a perfect
[1:13:36] man that's the faith of the father
[1:13:39] that's back to the
[1:13:40] word show me one denomination that ever
[1:13:43] took the word of
[1:13:45] God I don't care if you want to call
[1:13:47] them Brites or Lula ites whatever you
[1:13:49] want to do it show it to
[1:13:51] me now you turn down the words you turn
[1:13:53] God down
[1:13:57] brother brandom in 1962 he was still
[1:13:59] trying to preach the faith of the
[1:14:00] fathers which was
[1:14:02] what Son of
[1:14:05] God it was why it was so hard for him to
[1:14:07] try to preach
[1:14:10] it then he seen that he couldn't
[1:14:12] couldn't keep on going remember he
[1:14:14] originally made a statement you know he
[1:14:16] said I'm not going to preach anything
[1:14:17] outside of this church he said out s
[1:14:19] I'll just preach these little
[1:14:21] things you get him about 62 63 something
[1:14:25] where right along in there
[1:14:27] 64 and he
[1:14:29] says I'm going to preach out there and
[1:14:33] then you look what he done and look
[1:14:35] where he went and the churches he
[1:14:38] preached in and the doctrines he
[1:14:40] preached in their church cuz why because
[1:14:43] he knew he'd already been turned down he
[1:14:46] knew the only thing he could do was
[1:14:47] bring the message listen the message for
[1:14:51] the bride
[1:14:58] right he knew the days was
[1:15:01] over he said it ain't no more
[1:15:04] revivals this is the last one it's
[1:15:06] finished
[1:15:07] up but then he did say there's one left
[1:15:10] for the
[1:15:12] bride right I going agree with
[1:15:15] it but listen see that's why I've tried
[1:15:18] my best to get you to see it see he was
[1:15:21] put
[1:15:22] out as Son of God
[1:15:25] out of the church ages as Son of
[1:15:29] God so when the son of man come unto
[1:15:31] view there was no way for him to even
[1:15:33] deal with anything in the
[1:15:36] churches and if it hadn't been for
[1:15:37] certain one of those they would have
[1:15:39] never let him come in churches
[1:15:44] right
[1:15:46] okay so what would he come up to
[1:15:49] be there's no other age thast of the
[1:15:52] trumpets nowh else was he put ever put
[1:15:56] out in any age but in the lady you see
[1:15:58] an age because they said we're rich and
[1:16:00] have need of nothing see that's the
[1:16:03] reason that's why it's written like
[1:16:06] that if you if the son of man's outside
[1:16:09] and you need him then you can't say I'm
[1:16:11] rich and have need of
[1:16:12] nothing you see what the blindness of
[1:16:15] mankind is
[1:16:17] bringing have need of
[1:16:19] nothing and you're miserable poor naked
[1:16:21] blind and don't know it he was put out
[1:16:24] of the church first
[1:16:27] age and then
[1:16:31] according to Luke
[1:16:38] 17:30 in the days when the son of man
[1:16:40] will be
[1:16:41] revealed he was already put out of the
[1:16:43] church church had done rejected him just
[1:16:45] get that in your mind and look at it
[1:16:47] right they had done turned him down oh
[1:16:49] yeah they wanted to shout and they want
[1:16:50] the glory can you see that can you see
[1:16:54] that God and his word can be standing
[1:16:56] right out there and we can be right in
[1:16:58] here screaming Jesus Jesus Jesus and
[1:17:01] worshiping him that's right no you don't
[1:17:03] see that if you did you'd jump up and
[1:17:05] shout about it you don't see it I'm just
[1:17:08] telling you you don't see it do what you
[1:17:10] want to you don't see it the way that
[1:17:13] I'm talking about
[1:17:15] it cuz you can't turn that down it's the
[1:17:19] truth we're in the day when the
[1:17:21] anointing can be poured out right and
[1:17:24] the churches are shouting more churches
[1:17:26] today never
[1:17:29] been but where's
[1:17:34] god well I just don't understand that
[1:17:36] well I know you don't understand
[1:17:39] it but just pray to God to open it to
[1:17:46] you he's put out of the church now
[1:17:50] listen to what he goes on to say the
[1:17:51] unveiling of
[1:17:53] God and remember between the Son of
[1:17:57] God in the lady in the lady ofan Church
[1:18:01] age they put him
[1:18:03] out and in Luke he said he would be
[1:18:06] revealed again as son of
[1:18:09] man the
[1:18:13] prophet fulfilling the rest of
[1:18:17] it the
[1:18:20] prophet okay was brother randam the
[1:18:22] prophet no but he was the one when God
[1:18:25] was in right right come on that's very
[1:18:27] close isn't it but it's still so close
[1:18:30] he said if you do that so you make me an
[1:18:32] antichrist look the message a Rapture
[1:18:36] they can pull these up and I'll run to
[1:18:37] them fast now we've come through the
[1:18:39] church ages but we're promised in the
[1:18:42] last days according to Malachi 4 that
[1:18:44] there would be a return again a prophet
[1:18:48] in the
[1:18:49] land that's Malachi 4 Malachi 4 is a
[1:18:53] prophet
[1:18:58] a prophet was to
[1:19:00] come fulfill Malachi 4 Luke 1730
[1:19:03] Revelations
[1:19:06] 10:7 a
[1:19:08] messenger was promised to come without
[1:19:11] him we don't have any
[1:19:15] hopes CU we got to depend upon
[1:19:19] that a prophet is promised to come in
[1:19:22] the land talking about about Elijah and
[1:19:25] the nature the five
[1:19:27] times
[1:19:30] right God promised that would take place
[1:19:33] and if that didn't take place we better
[1:19:35] be looking for somebody
[1:19:37] else but I'm not doing no looking I
[1:19:39] don't know about
[1:19:44] you but
[1:19:47] listen he goes on to say in the message
[1:19:50] hearing receiving and acting I can pull
[1:19:53] these up you can read it all
[1:19:55] he's talking about the Holy Ghost that
[1:19:56] knows the secrets of the
[1:19:59] heart we'll see whether the word comes
[1:20:02] you know we'll in other words we'll see
[1:20:03] whether the word is who's it come to the
[1:20:06] prophet we'll see whether the word comes
[1:20:08] the word of God comes to the prophet or
[1:20:12] not we'll see that and
[1:20:15] I'm not the
[1:20:17] prophet he
[1:20:20] is he's the
[1:20:21] one R around wouldn't the prop prophet

[1:20:29] prophet all of those prophets in the Old
[1:20:31] Testament were a prophets now watch the
[1:20:34] tell watch what I'm telling you and
[1:20:36] you'll see that when it if you'll follow
[1:20:38] it you can follow it into brother R's
[1:20:40] Ministry and see right where he went to
[1:20:44] every one of those prophets all said
[1:20:46] thus sayith the
[1:20:49] Lord
[1:20:51] right how many times did Brother Ram
[1:20:53] said thus sayith the Lord
[1:20:59] but the Lord Jesus never said thus
[1:21:00] sayith the
[1:21:01] Lord he was the Lord he spoke in the
[1:21:04] first person because he was the first
[1:21:06] person brother Brown listen let me get
[1:21:08] it back in the Old Testament uh in the
[1:21:11] songs of Solomon he spoke in the first
[1:21:13] person right they pierced my hands and
[1:21:15] my feet these he spoke in the first
[1:21:18] person but he wasn't the first
[1:21:21] person right but that's very close isn't
[1:21:23] it what about a th sayth the Lord that
[1:21:25] means the Lord told you something to go
[1:21:27] say thus sayith the
[1:21:29] Lord and see how did Brother randam end
[1:21:31] up in the end of his
[1:21:35] ministry he got so close until it was
[1:21:38] very very close because he was bringing
[1:21:40] something into
[1:21:43] being but remember what he had to do
[1:21:46] when he told sister had it right he said
[1:21:49] you say it and I'll speak it behind you
[1:21:53] she couldn't get it
[1:21:56] come on you say she got it and this she
[1:21:58] balked evident a little bit he said
[1:21:59] sister had it right that's thus saith
[1:22:02] the
[1:22:03] Lord and when it did there it
[1:22:06] was see she still couldn't get that
[1:22:09] straight we're going to have to get it
[1:22:12] straight or we ain't going out of here
[1:22:14] in Rapture that's right but he said I'm
[1:22:16] not the prophet he's the one you
[1:22:21] believe so then if he's not the prophet
[1:22:23] he's not the son of man right go ahead
[1:22:25] to the next one number seven which is
[1:22:28] questions and answers
[1:22:31] 1964 well that's a good question because
[1:22:33] he said some say brother brandham is the
[1:22:35] son of man I thought the pillar of fire
[1:22:37] was the son of man am I mistaken well
[1:22:40] that's a good question you very good but
[1:22:43] I am not the son of man but a son of man
[1:22:47] there's quite a difference Jesus was the
[1:22:50] son of man the Son of God the son of
[1:22:54] David he's all of them but brother
[1:22:56] random was not the son of
[1:22:59] man but the people couldn't get it
[1:23:05] straight I know what he goes on to say
[1:23:07] in that
[1:23:08] message come on down I agreed with you I
[1:23:10] have no
[1:23:14] problem until I'm definitely led to do
[1:23:18] something then I say what I must say
[1:23:25] but that hour hasn't
[1:23:29] arrived I don't mind proing that he said
[1:23:32] I'm not so what is he I am not the
[1:23:36] anointed son of man I don't claim to be
[1:23:38] his Prophet many times it said you know
[1:23:40] what he say preacher means Prophet
[1:23:44] no next one let me get to you I'll just
[1:23:46] read them fire off the message of trial
[1:23:49] he said what it would be the son of man
[1:23:53] not not not the son of God God now the
[1:23:55] Son of God in a son of
[1:24:00] man who was brother randam a son of
[1:24:03] man God was using a son of man to bring
[1:24:08] his
[1:24:10] message because it goes to what I want
[1:24:13] to read this one go ahead to number
[1:24:15] nine it be in the hours that the son of
[1:24:18] man will be revealed on Earth not Son of
[1:24:20] God no more son of man come back as the
[1:24:23] prophetic
[1:24:26] message for the last
[1:24:29] day when that
[1:24:33] eagle will be flying not the
[1:24:37] lon not the ox in the sacrifice age that
[1:24:43] eagle but just remember now you got to
[1:24:45] hold that because if you make
[1:24:48] him that eagle you're making him that
[1:24:52] Prophet which would make him the son of
[1:24:55] man and then you're going to be in bad
[1:24:57] shape when we quote the next quote not
[1:24:59] off of here but where brother R said he
[1:25:01] was making way for the
[1:25:03] Eagles
[1:25:09] Laurel oh but but brother Dale you're
[1:25:11] just taking it too far uhuh we ain't
[1:25:13] went far enough okay look at the next
[1:25:16] one the only want the end
[1:25:18] time he's talking about in that very day
[1:25:21] that the son of man is revealed
[1:25:22] Revelations 10 1-7 read it when you get
[1:25:25] home the seventh Angels
[1:25:29] message opening up the seals what is it
[1:25:33] not the angel is the son of man but the
[1:25:36] messenger is revealing the son of man
[1:25:39] watch him can you get it separated
[1:25:42] now that's where it seems to be so hard
[1:25:45] for you you see not the son of man
[1:25:48] himself but the seventh angel the
[1:25:50] seventh messenger is revealing to the
[1:25:53] public
[1:25:54] the son of man because it's left the
[1:26:00] shook he can't organize it it's a
[1:26:03] grain I can understand listen folks I'm
[1:26:06] human
[1:26:08] being but if You' have said in the
[1:26:10] presence of that man to where that
[1:26:12] everything that you turned around he was
[1:26:14] just telling you all about what was
[1:26:15] taking place and what was going to be
[1:26:17] and all like that I can understand why
[1:26:19] they could believe him as being God I
[1:26:21] have no
[1:26:22] problem I can understand
[1:26:26] him because I'm saying it this way it
[1:26:28] doesn't matter biggest portion sitting
[1:26:30] right here today we would all get
[1:26:32] confused enough to have problems if we
[1:26:34] sat under that Ministry like that man
[1:26:41] was one that gets me really was a great
[1:26:44] one is when brother Brandon went to that
[1:26:47] Indian
[1:26:50] reservation and they had a bunch of
[1:26:52] Indians trying to supply apply for go
[1:26:54] government Aid orever what it was you
[1:26:56] know you know the
[1:27:00] story but they couldn't prove their
[1:27:06] birthday they couldn't prove their
[1:27:10] birthday now let's don't be
[1:27:12] stupid because remember the government
[1:27:14] had some
[1:27:16] records They had records listen to the
[1:27:20] story they told brother brandom said
[1:27:23] they can't prove their birthday he said
[1:27:24] bring them by here one at a
[1:27:26] time he stood right there and gave them
[1:27:29] a birthday you say he just gave them a
[1:27:31] birthday you don't know no he told them
[1:27:34] the birthday they was born on it
[1:27:36] wouldn't matter what else they was born
[1:27:38] and you know what a lot of them is like
[1:27:40] and I'm not throwing off on my aunt I
[1:27:41] loved her but you know my aunt had nine
[1:27:45] kids I think it was eight or nine and
[1:27:47] you know she couldn't tell you none of
[1:27:48] those children's
[1:27:50] birthday I'm not joking this is true
[1:27:53] she'd say odini was born in cotton
[1:27:54] picking
[1:27:56] time that JC's born in that big
[1:28:00] storm she didn't have enough
[1:28:02] intelligence to give a
[1:28:04] date but you know what there was a
[1:28:08] storm go back and find when the storm
[1:28:11] happened that was when he was
[1:28:14] born come on get what I'm saying you
[1:28:16] mean the government the man sitting down
[1:28:19] there this guy's birthday this guy's
[1:28:20] birthday this guy's birthday and the
[1:28:22] government said okay we'll just give him
[1:28:23] the money money now don't be
[1:28:29] stupid they had some records and when he
[1:28:32] began to put them people in place of
[1:28:34] them records They had to agree that that
[1:28:37] was that man's birthday they had some
[1:28:41] records and they knew it was
[1:28:43] right don't you go down to the go down
[1:28:46] to the Social Security office and said I
[1:28:49] don't know when my birthday was but now
[1:28:51] this fell here beside of me he going to
[1:28:52] tell you when I was born
[1:28:55] well they going to laugh you out of the
[1:28:57] place but if this guy can tell the day
[1:29:00] of this happen or whatever and say I
[1:29:02] can't remember what it was but said you
[1:29:03] remember there in 36 when there was that
[1:29:06] great big flood they say yeah he's got
[1:29:10] something to put it on don't be dumb in
[1:29:11] what you're taking don't just take
[1:29:13] things as haphazardly as of this out of
[1:29:16] the other those government people knew
[1:29:17] what run around and was talking about
[1:29:19] they had some
[1:29:20] records and they gave those people the
[1:29:22] money
[1:29:25] but God gave him their
[1:29:30] birthdays how close was it to him being
[1:29:37] God but you can't make him
[1:29:40] God if you do you messed up your whole
[1:29:43] Bible God was in the man using
[1:29:47] him using
[1:29:50] him but listen God was in balum
[1:29:57] uhoh what balam said was the truth and
[1:30:01] what balam said is in the Bible am I
[1:30:05] right
[1:30:09] oh now you get the
[1:30:12] story to what it
[1:30:14] was the angel was
[1:30:19] not the son of
[1:30:21] man the seventh angel
[1:30:24] is revealing to the public the son of
[1:30:30] man what's the next one we'll quit it
[1:30:34] then this is number 10 a so go ahead and
[1:30:37] pull he said I wasn't the one that
[1:30:39] appeared down on the o on the river I
[1:30:42] was only standing there when he appeared
[1:30:44] I'm not the one that performs these
[1:30:46] things and foretells these things that
[1:30:48] happens as perfectly they are perfect
[1:30:50] they are I'm only one that's near when
[1:30:53] he does it
[1:30:54] I was only a voice that he used to say
[1:30:57] it wasn't what I knew it's what I say
[1:30:59] what I just surrendered myself to that
[1:31:03] he spoke through it isn't me it isn't
[1:31:06] the seventh angel oh no it was the
[1:31:09] manifestation of the son of
[1:31:11] man right because it was taking place it
[1:31:14] wasn't the angel his message it was the
[1:31:16] mystery that God unfolded it's not a man
[1:31:18] it's God the angel was not the son of
[1:31:21] man he was the messenger from the son of
[1:31:23] man the the son of man is Christ he says
[1:31:26] we're not feeding on a man we're feeding
[1:31:28] on the body word of a man which is who
[1:31:31] the son of man
[1:31:33] right let me give you this one though to
[1:31:36] make sure you don't lose where we're
[1:31:37] going go ahead with the next one which
[1:31:39] is works his faith expressed see I like
[1:31:41] this I like to bring out things to make
[1:31:44] you
[1:31:45] think well brother Dale you're seen to
[1:31:48] be pointing to a bunch of people cuz
[1:31:51] we've listened to you we've kind of
[1:31:52] figured that out by now
[1:31:54] that after all these years you seem to
[1:31:56] be pointing to uh because that was what
[1:31:58] I said in 69 that the Bride of Jesus
[1:32:02] Christ would be the son of
[1:32:04] man not a son of
[1:32:08] man he would be the son of
[1:32:13] man see I don't mind then giving you
[1:32:15] this watch as it was in the days of
[1:32:17] Sodom so shall it be in the coming of
[1:32:19] the son of man now watch
[1:32:21] him in the days that that the church is
[1:32:25] being
[1:32:28] revealed how close is
[1:32:33] that he says
[1:32:36] no this is not the day of the church
[1:32:39] being revealed because remember church
[1:32:40] is a word you can use for all
[1:32:43] churches all people are called
[1:32:47] churches this is not the revealing this
[1:32:50] is the revealing of the son of man where
[1:32:51] he he to be revealed
[1:32:56] where is he to be
[1:33:04] revealed it was once the uniting in the
[1:33:07] time and sign it was once done in the
[1:33:09] form of the son of man on Earth and he
[1:33:11] had to give his life to bring about a
[1:33:14] power to unite other men with this same
[1:33:17] power for the Bride of Jesus
[1:33:21] Christ there's a difference in the
[1:33:23] church and a
[1:33:26] bride but I have no problem with him
[1:33:28] saying that about a church because it is
[1:33:30] not me and you being
[1:33:33] revealed I have never preached that I've
[1:33:35] never preached that it would be people
[1:33:37] that's being
[1:33:39] revealed it's God in the people that's
[1:33:42] being
[1:33:43] revealed the son of man is
[1:33:46] God now where he that is left up to
[1:33:51] him and I've never preached it it would
[1:33:53] be in one
[1:33:55] person it' be in a bride around the
[1:34:00] world Christ returning in the form of
[1:34:03] the word message trial working in human
[1:34:06] beings and showing the signs that he
[1:34:10] promised it would sign it would
[1:34:15] do Jesus in The Bride form same power
[1:34:19] same Christ same thing
[1:34:26] I've never pointed to an individual or
[1:34:27] people or whatever I point to Jesus
[1:34:30] Christ but now when he points back and
[1:34:32] shows you where that's at I have no
[1:34:34] problems with it either there's where
[1:34:36] our problem is we're not accepting what
[1:34:38] he says about
[1:34:41] us you can differ with me all you want
[1:34:43] to but you better swallow that statement
[1:34:46] we're not accepting What God Says About
[1:34:51] Us may I example it he says by Stripes
[1:34:54] we're healed so that means we're healed
[1:34:57] right we're just not accepting this
[1:34:59] reason we're not healed right when he
[1:35:01] says we are the body of Jesus Christ
[1:35:03] we're just not accepting
[1:35:05] that and brother Bram says and I know I
[1:35:08] made a statement brother random the one
[1:35:11] that said it he said the
[1:35:12] bride was the fullness of the godhead
[1:35:15] bodily oh of course you're going to
[1:35:18] listen to that are you going to listen
[1:35:19] to the big man that's passed on but yet
[1:35:24] I wouldn't have said it if I didn't hear
[1:35:25] him say it on a tape he said it like
[1:35:28] this he said you say the bride is the
[1:35:30] fullness of the godhead bodily he said
[1:35:36] hogash I didn't say it brother Brown did
[1:35:38] he hog washed brother brandom not
[1:35:42] me of course who's going to believe
[1:35:48] it you know who's the only one that's
[1:35:51] going to believe who they really are is
[1:35:53] the Bride of Jesus Christ that's
[1:35:57] right you'll believe it God it's
[1:36:02] impossible do you understand what I've
[1:36:04] drove at for since 1969 to say that the
[1:36:08] Bride of Jesus Christ is the son of
[1:36:14] man brother BR said the godhead is not
[1:36:16] complete without
[1:36:19] you he said no leaving among you brings
[1:36:22] the fullness of the godhead body
[1:36:25] you know what leev is denomination of
[1:36:27] ideas you know what denomination of
[1:36:29] ideas is the worst for us right now is
[1:36:31] to not believe who we
[1:36:33] are cuz that's Satan's tactics he ain't
[1:36:36] driving no Trinity down our roads he
[1:36:39] ain't come Among Us here he's never done
[1:36:41] it here he knows that he can't bring it
[1:36:44] a couple of guys come in here trying to
[1:36:45] produce some things and they got
[1:36:48] out because we would not follow after
[1:36:52] they're cunningly divided
[1:36:57] fables because we just wouldn't believe
[1:37:02] it I didn't come out preaching the bride
[1:37:05] would be would be I didn't come out pre
[1:37:07] brother brandom's the one that come out
[1:37:08] preaching
[1:37:09] it if I can quote him why can't you
[1:37:12] believe
[1:37:13] him well I just don't see it well does
[1:37:16] that make it
[1:37:21] wrong you couldn't be be like like one
[1:37:23] brother did one time he was up somewhere
[1:37:26] sitting he told me later he was sitting
[1:37:29] there and these two brothers were
[1:37:30] talking about brother
[1:37:31] Dale and they was saying brother Dale
[1:37:34] was wrong here cuz he taught it this way
[1:37:35] and taught it that way and brother said
[1:37:37] he told him he said I know brother Dale
[1:37:41] and he never taught it that
[1:37:43] way well you know what I shook his hand
[1:37:45] and thanked him for at least standing up
[1:37:47] for me but you know what he evidently
[1:37:51] believed that I wouldn't trying to bring
[1:37:53] it that way
[1:37:57] well I just don't know I just don't know
[1:38:00] well okay
[1:38:04] listen the greatest Christmas
[1:38:08] gift to me that could ever be given to
[1:38:13] anyone is Jesus Christ coming into our
[1:38:17] hearts and living in the new birth of
[1:38:20] eternal life
[1:38:24] the next thing which would go with it in
[1:38:26] this age and be part of it would
[1:38:29] be and you'll follow me what I said this
[1:38:32] age has got to have Son of God and son
[1:38:33] of
[1:38:34] man it's got to come in
[1:38:37] together the greatest gift could be that
[1:38:40] would be this message that we have the
[1:38:42] opportunity to read and
[1:38:45] believe but do we read it believe it
[1:38:48] like that it is God speaking to us
[1:38:54] or do we believe it like well let help
[1:38:59] me I I can't believe it as being this
[1:39:02] God's word
[1:39:05] well there was a whole bunch of men
[1:39:07] wrote this
[1:39:08] Bible do you believe
[1:39:13] that come
[1:39:16] on you say yeah but I know where brother
[1:39:18] around I know where the Holy Ghost can
[1:39:20] show us where he was missing it at but
[1:39:22] he'll tell you he misses it so don't
[1:39:24] worry about
[1:39:28] it yes but I I just what going back
[1:39:31] where you come
[1:39:36] from but you see Church the greatest
[1:39:38] Christmas thoughts could ever
[1:39:42] be is to have eternal life in our
[1:39:45] souls and to have a message that God has
[1:39:48] given us that has
[1:39:51] stood the test of time
[1:39:54] time it's out there I put it out you
[1:39:57] come show me where brother random missed
[1:39:59] it at I've done that ever since I
[1:40:01] started when it opened up on internet I
[1:40:03] just knew for sure that we was going to
[1:40:04] get lambasted to hard until there
[1:40:06] wouldn't be enough internet to take care
[1:40:08] of all of the end and comings to do it
[1:40:11] I've had a couple of little silly things
[1:40:14] sent to me and most of them was brother
[1:40:17] Dale you didn't understand brother so
[1:40:19] and so cuz he didn't teach it that way
[1:40:26] well at least let me be one
[1:40:29] thing what do you like it or not or
[1:40:32] anybody likes it let me be one thing I
[1:40:34] tell you what I believe and where I got
[1:40:36] it
[1:40:39] at come show me your doctrines where you
[1:40:41] got them
[1:40:47] at but see church this church is not
[1:40:51] built on a man or what he's doing or any
[1:40:53] man that says anything these church is
[1:40:55] built on one thing and that's the word
[1:40:56] of
[1:40:58] God you see me off of it you come to me
[1:41:01] you're Duty bound to show me where I
[1:41:03] missed
[1:41:07] it I don't know what else I could be
[1:41:10] than to tell you that
[1:41:15] away that way is my love for
[1:41:19] you the greatest thought that I could
[1:41:22] ever think about of anybody giving me
[1:41:24] for
[1:41:26] Christmas would be to believe God's
[1:41:29] word and stand on his
[1:41:33] word that's the greatest part could ever
[1:41:35] be for me to believe him and try to give
[1:41:39] it back to him he stood my place he took
[1:41:43] my place in death he took my place in
[1:41:47] everything all he wants us to do is take
