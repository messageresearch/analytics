[2:46] us here so remember that all right if
[2:48] you look over you can see
[2:50] if they want to they closed the door but
[2:53] if you want to its dust okay they pull
[2:57] it back to ya okay the room in there
[3:01] we'll try to get it ironed out to we're
[3:02] working things but we the study's not
[3:05] complete yet we still like to carp it
[3:08] but we've got some rearrangements up
[3:10] here at the front now so don't worry
[3:12] about it and get all excited we'll just
[3:14] figure it all out and it'll work
[3:17] eventually you know one way or the other
[3:19] so do that and also we would ask you
[3:22] because my wife has been up here working
[3:26] I've been doing a lot of the work and
[3:28] doing things through the wiring and
[3:29] different thing and she's been doing a
[3:33] lot of picking up moving and changing
[3:35] things and if you would you know just
[3:38] asking you know I'm not throwing nobody
[3:41] I'm just saying it looks like it's um
[3:43] pues you've got four or five quilts you
[3:46] know well just narrow that down to one
[3:49] per person you know not have extra ones
[3:53] and all kind of books and everything
[3:56] else laying around and there's things
[3:59] under the seats into the seats we know
[4:01] where we don't have too good of a
[4:02] situation here but we still would like
[4:05] to keep it in a decent order to where it
[4:08] can be done and like the children you
[4:11] know and I'm making this statement to
[4:13] everybody basically while they're here I
[4:15] think a child somewhere in there say
[4:17] seven eight years old the children
[4:20] should be able to get to where that
[4:21] they're sitting down and listening
[4:23] instead of doing all of the draw in and
[4:27] the peddling and all like that now in
[4:29] little ones it'll hurt your feelings you
[4:31] know but that you should be listening to
[4:33] what the minister is saying to the
[4:36] congregation instead of doing all of the
[4:39] other things and if you do that it would
[4:41] take out a lot of the material that are
[4:44] in the seats okay because a lot of it
[4:48] dar is for children they're doing but
[4:51] now we try to be you know we don't try
[4:53] to be too hard on you we just try to do
[4:57] the best we can and all like that we
[5:00] don't have the best accommodations but
[5:02] they'll license till the Lord come
[5:04] so if you could take some of your stuff
[5:06] home in other words if a child is there
[5:09] it don't need 18 toys right well I want
[5:13] this and I want that one don't you worry
[5:15] about it
[5:15] if you draw everybody it brought
[5:17] everybody their kids you know they'd
[5:19] have a church full of toys we wouldn't
[5:22] have no place to sit so if you would
[5:23] help us to do that and pick up a lot of
[5:26] the stuff that's dire and things and you
[5:29] know and put it in order and put your
[5:32] seats in order and don't complain about
[5:35] the other ones just get yours in order
[5:36] you said well they're not doing it on
[5:38] the other seat that ain't got nothing to
[5:39] do with it it's get your seat in order
[5:42] get your place in order and that way you
[5:46] know it'll be a little bit better okay
[5:48] all right because that's what we try to
[5:50] do the best we can any other
[5:52] announcements just remember these things
[6:00] and pray the Lord would bless us all
[6:01] right father we thank you for this day
[6:03] and your grace and to us we thank you
[6:05] for all things we thank you for Calvary
[6:09] thank you for grace the Lord what kind
[6:11] of a day would it be without you that we
[6:14] thank you lord thank you for loving us
[6:17] Lord having your way with each and every
[6:19] one of us and father just guide us into
[6:21] your understanding that your light and
[6:24] they walk before us and then we can
[6:27] follow that light and it will lead us
[6:29] into greater days we love you and we
[6:31] thank you remember the sick ones there
[6:33] was just a cleaner that I were the old
[6:35] cold and things and just be with her and
[6:37] just take it that all that away and all
[6:40] the other sicknesses among us we believe
[6:42] you you said you sent your word and
[6:45] healed us so we believe you now just
[6:48] make it manifest we love you and we
[6:49] thank you in jesus name john 1 in the
[6:59] beginning was the word and the Word was
[7:01] with God and the Word was God the same
[7:04] was in the beginning with God all things
[7:07] were made by him now we won't get dire
[7:10] this morning we'll try to pick up the
[7:12] create or this afternoon if we can all
[7:15] right but it says all things were made
[7:17] by him
[7:18] and who is he the word who's the word
[7:21] God
[7:22] so you're still dealing on the one God
[7:25] and coming out to the understanding see
[7:28] all things were made by him and without
[7:30] him was not anything made that was made
[7:33] in him was life and the life was the
[7:36] light of men and the light shining in
[7:39] darkness and the darkness comprehended
[7:40] it not just the one verse from Ezekiel
[7:45] if we can get to that we wanted to
[7:46] Wednesday but we didn't get there but
[7:49] we'll try to do it to date
[7:51] all right ezekiel 18:4 says behold now
[7:55] this is God speaking back up read it the
[7:57] word of the Lord came unto me saying
[7:59] what means it's about the grapes and the
[8:02] things and and the Proverbs and all the
[8:04] nen he says behold all souls are mine
[8:09] so now don't even think about well the
[8:12] devil give me a soul and God just get
[8:14] all that garbage out the Bible plainly
[8:17] tells you all right all souls are mine
[8:22] so if they've sold any were it had its
[8:25] originality from God
[8:27] whether you're Christian or not the soul
[8:33] is the real you okay we'll get to those
[8:36] things behold all souls are mine as the
[8:39] soul of the father who also the soul of
[8:43] the son is mine the soul that sinneth it
[8:46] shall die you may be seated
[8:49] well by the Lord that is blessing now to
[8:53] the reading of the word I know that I'm
[8:58] constantly repeating myself I know that
[9:06] and I know I do that purposely ah yes -
[9:12] who gets the notes
[9:15] Terrence is not here so he left it a
[9:18] little blank to put up your hand hold it
[9:20] up until you get you notes and make sure
[9:24] brother Larry they left one back there
[9:27] in his seat we want to make sure you get
[9:31] them at Terrence didn't
[9:32] Lelia so and we can do it this way who
[9:34] got in Joshua Pye somehow all right now
[9:39] we have spent a quite a time talking
[9:43] about in our are dealing has been before
[9:49] the foundation of the world we haven't
[9:53] got to time yet we haven't reached the
[9:57] situation of discussing time and
[10:00] physical creations we'll try to get dar
[10:03] this afternoon if we can all right but
[10:07] we're trying to deal with the situation
[10:09] and I notice I've got it in here
[10:12] we're bread around him he said I'm not
[10:14] trying to in other words preached the
[10:18] doctrine he said I'm trying to
[10:20] straighten out what man's ideas about a
[10:23] doctrines in science all right
[10:25] there's all kind of doctrines in the
[10:27] message I keep repeating that because
[10:30] it's true
[10:31] all kind of doctrines are the people of
[10:33] the message of this that or the other
[10:36] you know in this then they say I've got
[10:39] two quotes for it and and all like that
[10:41] and they can't read them to you
[10:43] that's that's fine you know and you say
[10:47] well if I read you what you probably
[10:48] said it must be right well we used to
[10:52] read acts 2:38 in Matthew 28:19 and we
[10:55] made it father son Holy Ghost right well
[11:00] we can do that with the message of the
[11:02] hour and the quotes and the things and
[11:05] just tie ourselves into knots but see
[11:08] what I'm trying to do is to get you to
[11:10] think sensibly and listen to quotes then
[11:14] sensibly alright the only way we can
[11:17] talk about of an existence of whatever
[11:22] before the foundation of the world it
[11:25] would have to be by way of the Prophet
[11:28] messenger or else it would be our own
[11:31] thoughts or concept right see then those
[11:35] thoughts and concepts are okay if they
[11:38] line up with the word the one thing I
[11:41] love to to when the Prophet made this
[11:43] statement one time
[11:45] he said ever prophet he told my prophets
[11:49] coming you know the Word of God coming
[11:52] through the prophets
[11:53] whatever prophet lines up his message
[11:57] that he's getting it must correspond
[12:00] with the prophets prior right so you
[12:06] can't have one prophet saying it's this
[12:08] way and one prophet saying this this
[12:10] away whatever is saying I don't care
[12:14] whether we understand it or not that's
[12:17] you know I do care but I'm just making
[12:19] that blunt to you that the fact is that
[12:22] if God says that he has to abide by it
[12:25] and he can't say something to one
[12:28] prophet and something other prophet he
[12:31] can't make one contrary to the other one
[12:32] so then ever wonder the prophets would
[12:35] have to check back prior to them you
[12:39] know and get there make sure they're
[12:42] lined up with all the way to Genesis
[12:45] what I didn't it amazing then that God
[12:47] would wait until the last days to bring
[12:51] us a prophet to where the entire Word of
[12:54] God could be brought to that prophet to
[12:57] be delivered to you now all right so
[12:59] it's lined up everywhere we don't have
[13:03] any trouble with it and what we have is
[13:07] we need a revelation you know we need
[13:12] for it to be revealed to us all right
[13:14] you forgive me for coughing and putting
[13:17] cough drops in but that a wolf sinus bug
[13:19] is doing and he's a give a ting me but
[13:23] that it's all right I have whispered
[13:27] before and don't worry about it but now
[13:30] listen trying to get the thought in
[13:32] order and that in the beginning we've
[13:41] read it over and over in the beginning
[13:45] was the word have we read that when we
[13:48] were in the bad news right I wouldn't
[13:51] change after would come into message it
[13:54] was us as opposed to change to fit the
[13:56] word
[13:57] but what did we read that is being in
[14:02] the beginning was the word the Word was
[14:05] with God see this to him let me talk
[14:09] coach said it was with him if it's with
[14:11] him it means he's with him you know but
[14:16] see then it goes on to say what and the
[14:20] word was god right now then it's
[14:25] self-explanatory but it's hidden from
[14:30] the eyes of the wise and prudent because
[14:34] wise man cannot figure that out see
[14:37] they've done everything in the book to
[14:39] try to figure John one out all right and
[14:44] so you couldn't get it straight and in
[14:46] line well alright but then you come into
[14:49] the simplicity of the message and you
[14:52] realize that there's just one true and
[14:53] living God and if there's not many
[15:00] there's many manifestations of that God
[15:03] many ways he reveals himself but it's
[15:07] the same God so then we're not figure
[15:10] well the father's here and the sons here
[15:12] and the Holy Ghost and over here and you
[15:15] know we're trying to see that the same
[15:21] great eternal self existing Elohim just
[15:24] stepped over into another form bro and
[15:29] you know what it steps over in the
[15:30] foreign to me the son the logos the
[15:35] speech it's the same God all right then
[15:39] it's the Holy Spirit it's the same God
[15:43] it's not many gods it's the same God
[15:48] being revealed in a different way manner
[15:51] are a manifestation to her that we can
[15:55] look at it to see the truth all right
[16:00] now in doing that then we took the last
[16:04] two or three messages has been dealing
[16:06] especially on it we're in Ephesians says
[16:11] that we were chosen in him before the
[16:14] foundation of the world all right then
[16:18] John says 15 16 since you have not
[16:22] chosen me but I've chosen you so now he
[16:29] was telling the disciples that they
[16:37] didn't choose him he chose them now if
[16:46] he chose them then Paul picked it up by
[16:52] saying we were chosen in him so you take
[16:56] what Jesus is saying and he said I chose
[16:59] you nor danger underwear got picked you
[17:01] out that's what it sounds like it's
[17:04] saying huh do you follow me I'm trying
[17:10] to illustrate the Godhead and talking of
[17:14] God for us to understand plain language
[17:16] of what we're saying here was the father
[17:18] it was not another person called a son
[17:22] and another person called the Holy Ghost
[17:25] right it's the same God in another form
[17:34] then take the truth of the Bible Jesus
[17:39] said you didn't choose me he said I
[17:43] chose you they'll be real careful of
[17:49] your thoughts go to remember Judas was
[17:54] chosen
[17:54] I leave that for you to think is it true
[18:05] Judas was chosen and ordained to be one
[18:09] of the apostles
[18:17] so now the Bible would say what make
[18:20] your calling he calls you to write along
[18:29] with the rest of them he chose the one
[18:32] do you remember the 70 that turned and
[18:34] walked away from him he called them but
[18:43] they never made their Judas never made
[18:45] his election sure he did because he went
[18:51] to his own wood he proved what he was so
[18:58] make your calling and election sure well
[19:06] you just make it to work I think I got
[19:09] it figured out until you freeze well
[19:11] that's good then that means you ain't
[19:13] got it figured out
[19:14] yeah it's all right I don't mean to hurt
[19:17] feelings I mean to be truthful but now
[19:21] remember Judas was chosen just as much
[19:23] as his rest of them he had part of the
[19:31] ministry he had gifts and signs and
[19:35] wonders did as well tried to make so
[19:43] much of a point about your choosing and
[19:46] and how it is and taking it back the end
[19:52] of not just a predestination alai deal
[19:56] or concept yeah well if I predestinate
[20:01] I'm predestinate you now hope you've
[20:05] caught on the one thing we've backed
[20:07] away up into God's mind from Derek back
[20:10] into the back part of God's mind to try
[20:12] to understand because now he says you
[20:20] didn't choose me I chose you
[20:22] well then he hand-picked people
[20:28] that's what it sounded like it's saying
[20:30] them go we know everybody he's not
[20:35] chosen right what did he he got pistol
[20:42] pick out down if he did why did he do it
[20:47] was it something you done or didn't do
[20:52] now we back up a little further right
[20:55] because you could do that with Jacob and
[20:58] Esau but your problem would be with
[21:01] Jacob and Esau is he saw would be the
[21:04] better guy than Jacob would be the
[21:06] troubled guy right because Esau was away
[21:11] on a better man then Jacob was Jacob
[21:15] wouldn't nothing but a shyster that's
[21:18] what he's really means that trip her up
[21:19] her he was a deceiver
[21:22] he saw wasn't that see we want to take
[21:27] he's on throw him totally away and all
[21:29] of these things oh he wasn't there he
[21:31] wasn't that remember when he's when
[21:35] Jacob was coming home he was sure he's
[21:39] always gonna kill him right he thought
[21:45] maybe I can appease him by giving him my
[21:46] families giving my ratios giving him
[21:48] maybe I can make up some touch him a
[21:51] little but before he got there Goddard
[21:54] already touch the heart of Esau and he
[21:58] saw goes out and said Jacob don't matter
[22:00] what you do I don't want none of your
[22:02] riches Jacob was a pretty good guy but
[22:08] he saw with a whole lot better
[22:10] so never make anything up on something
[22:14] you do or didn't do now we'll get to
[22:18] that to where you can see it once we
[22:21] come into the earth and the life
[22:22] situations like foolish virgins and
[22:27] things like that will be dealt with upon
[22:30] the basis or what they done or didn't do
[22:35] anything you feel filled you will be
[22:39] based on the basic code it
[22:40] it says they kept the word but they were
[22:44] not born again Christians it's the word
[22:48] of the hour for what they were all right
[22:50] trying to get you to look at something
[22:54] make your calling and election sure he
[23:00] said well Jesus that he chose me okay
[23:08] why did you see I'm just
[23:16] a simple question I try to to be able to
[23:19] talk about it and whatever but I have
[23:23] simple questions but see Paul look at
[23:29] the way Paul picked it up because even
[23:33] to take what Jesus would say in John it
[23:35] would look like
[23:37] he picked different ones for some reason
[23:41] right it's not that the way it looks but
[23:48] see watch a man that comes over and all
[23:53] it was was John riding what Jesus said
[23:56] jesus knew what he's talking about we
[23:59] when mankind read it what does it make
[24:01] it look like to you and I am I right
[24:05] mankind to read the Word of God doesn't
[24:08] look too good sometimes but remember
[24:11] it's got to say the same thing so when
[24:18] John says in his writings about what
[24:21] Jesus said he said you didn't choose me
[24:25] I chose you now Paul said me that we
[24:38] were chosen in him before the foundation
[24:41] of the world I don't I know Church I'm
[24:50] sorry I'm a closest in my life to come
[24:56] into quitting preaching instead I am
[24:59] because I found it out but it stills
[25:02] thing don't seem to ring a bell were you
[25:06] you've got contradictions ever were but
[25:11] you're talking and you're doing and
[25:18] they're not in the Bible there's no
[25:22] contradiction in the Word of God
[25:25] Matthew 28:19 is not contoured acts 2:38
[25:29] right they saying the same thing if you
[25:34] don't believe that I wish you'd get a
[25:35] little message we're brother Branham
[25:37] let's see what was the title they were
[25:42] listening just recently it's where all
[25:45] the ministers come together I'll
[25:48] remember the title the minute all the
[25:50] ministers remember come together and
[25:53] they were gonna challenge brother
[25:54] Branham on this this is the Godhead I
[25:58] believe the title Godhead explained and
[26:01] we should listen to that see we're still
[26:05] arguing what Matthew 28:19 comparison to
[26:08] acts 2:38 and we say well this one was
[26:11] writing this was wrong now they're both
[26:13] saying identically the same thing and
[26:17] that's why now we are two oh I'm glad
[26:20] her father yeah we've got a couple that
[26:22] wants to be baptized okay cuz a little
[26:24] wouldn't want to be baptized alright we
[26:26] can't be in it this coming weekend cuz
[26:28] it breaks a everybody be gone but it'll
[26:30] be the night I believe that's right
[26:32] tenth ever what the Sun default wrong
[26:35] it'll not be this coming Sunday but the
[26:37] next when the Lord willing we'll have a
[26:39] baptism or service so if he and the rest
[26:41] of you think about it want to be
[26:43] baptized we'll try to do that but I love
[26:47] it the way brother branham does a
[26:48] baptismal service and that's the reason
[26:51] I do it that way so he said this is a
[26:53] way to do it he said to fulfill Matthew
[26:58] 28:19 the baptized in the name of the
[27:02] Father and of the Son and of the Holy
[27:04] Ghost he said I now baptize you in the
[27:08] name of the Lord Jesus Christ and he
[27:14] says in that tape he said see you
[27:16] brothers I'm not against you on the
[27:20] basis that you baptize Father Son and
[27:22] Holy Ghost he said because the word says
[27:27] that but he says the truth of it is
[27:29] that's not saying what we read it it's
[27:34] saying Lord Jesus Christ and I said
[27:38] rejoicing in my heart to hear him I knew
[27:41] he did cuz that's the way I've always
[27:42] baptized you hear me when you get
[27:45] baptized to fulfill the Great Commission
[27:51] but the Lord Jesus said the baptized in
[27:53] the name of the Father and of the Son
[27:55] and Holy Baptism I brother/sister in the
[27:58] name of the Lord Jesus Christ now Satan
[28:02] can argue over nothing that shows that
[28:05] there's no contradiction in the Word of
[28:07] God all right Allah sees in John says
[28:14] Jesus in his writing says you didn't
[28:17] choose me I chose you now how did he
[28:21] choose Paul says we were chosen in him
[28:33] that's how he chose that's the same
[28:37] thing Jesus is saying Jesus has not said
[28:43] what we mentally read we mentally read
[28:47] and it looks like he's picking and
[28:49] choosing and remember the Prophet said
[28:52] he don't predestinate by his desires nor
[28:54] nothing he predestinated by desires he's
[29:03] picking and choosing
[29:04] that's your own predestination the
[29:06] pinnacle I mean the presbyterian the
[29:08] Baptist and things but when Peters when
[29:14] Paul said we were chosen in him before
[29:23] the foundation of the world
[29:32] and the Prophet says it what
[29:33] emphatically stating if we wasn't back
[29:36] there we never will be back there well
[29:44] yeah we want to figure out some ray of
[29:46] us getting something without going
[29:50] through the truth what does it mean when
[29:56] he said and I emphasize that over and
[29:58] over times 2 or 3 messages it doesn't
[30:01] say that we were chosen by him them come
[30:05] on I'm open I leave it you'll find
[30:08] brother Branham talking in his message
[30:10] in preaching said we were chosen by him
[30:13] but remember he can't be contrary to the
[30:16] scripture they said we were chosen in
[30:18] him what do you think is that a
[30:28] contradiction well what's your answer
[30:41] all right we were chosen in him that's
[30:50] why I've emphasized over and over it's
[30:53] not whether or not I chose him that's
[30:59] what we based it on brother Brennan said
[31:04] what he said it's not the fact of you
[31:06] accepting him we've got to do that you
[31:08] have to accept him he's not saying we
[31:11] don't accept him we accept him we said
[31:16] Lord I accept you as my savior but what
[31:19] if he don't accept us though then the
[31:24] Prophet says what he said it's not
[31:26] whether or not you accepted him he said
[31:28] it's whether or not he accepted you
[31:37] listen Church I'm trying to preach
[31:39] something that one of these days you'll
[31:41] back up and look at it and you'll say
[31:43] Lord God thank you
[31:45] I now can understand the Scriptures that
[31:53] were once so confusing in my mind
[31:59] don't tell me it's not confusing in your
[32:02] human mind to read one scripture as I
[32:04] said to read where Jesus said you didn't
[32:10] choose me I chose you and I ordained you
[32:15] he told Jeremiah wouldn't it he said I
[32:19] knew then ordained as a prophet before
[32:21] the foundation of the world
[32:28] listen church
[32:34] think about it
[32:44] he listened to your weight listening
[32:48] everybody listening real good he never
[32:56] chose you to be a part of himself oh
[33:07] we're getting down to something listen
[33:12] to what said he never chose you to be a
[33:16] part of himself if you have eternal life
[33:30] he never chose you to be a part of
[33:33] himself if you have eternal life you are
[33:36] a part of him you got it he never chose
[33:49] you to be a part of himself that's
[33:53] picking and choosing then don't matter
[33:54] where you want to put it when you get to
[33:59] the picking and choosing you'll start
[34:00] something you did or didn't do if you
[34:06] have eternal life that eternal life is
[34:10] the life of Almighty God is that right
[34:14] that's why your prophet will say if you
[34:18] have eternal life you always was eternal
[34:22] what always me I would always eternal
[34:33] I come here with eternal life in me
[34:37] that's what people are quotes you will
[34:42] have asked a simple question if that's
[34:43] true then what did Jesus died for
[34:48] remember the other day that I was trying
[34:50] to bring out Nicodemus and the thing why
[34:53] didn't Jesus they say Nicodemus you just
[34:55] need to realize you always was eternal
[34:58] because that's what the people of the
[35:00] message are making the new birth there's
[35:02] a knowledge of something instead of it
[35:08] being the person of Jesus Christ but
[35:11] listen he never chose you to be a part
[35:15] of himself if you have eternal life
[35:21] dad eternal out is a part of him and
[35:24] there's his children
[35:26] darzee's offspring he never chose
[35:34] children he had children they many of in
[35:41] here chose you children I mean basically
[35:45] I'm in here you know basic about all the
[35:47] grown-ups anyway you've got children
[35:49] right now did any of you choose them
[35:57] come on now it would be funny but we'll
[36:00] get it that's why I see people would say
[36:02] the man said I want a boy girl you know
[36:07] the wife she says I want a girl now you
[36:10] you're bound to get one of the two what
[36:18] did brother a did you choose your
[36:20] children now come on I'm gonna quote to
[36:22] message people there's people in this
[36:27] message that I heard years ago made a
[36:29] statement and said I'm not gonna have no
[36:33] more children cuz it might not be a true
[36:37] seed of God and said I'll only have a
[36:44] child if I know it's a true see
[36:46] well that's gonna be a good marital
[36:48] relationship man because he's on one
[36:51] side wanting a boy and he figures it
[36:54] Friday would be a good day now I'm not
[36:56] trying to be nice to him right and
[36:57] trying to say it right which he'd say no
[37:00] it's the girls what we got to do it on
[37:02] Wednesday now what do you got
[37:05] so you shouldn't bring up stuff like
[37:07] that that's plain language we're adults
[37:10] you never chose no child you didn't
[37:15] pre-plan your children ah you know what
[37:17] I'm talking about I'm not talking about
[37:21] the basis that's when you got together
[37:23] you said okay we're not gonna do
[37:26] anything we're gonna let everything run
[37:30] and God give us what you never chose
[37:33] your children right your children are a
[37:43] part of you we take the male with a DNA
[37:51] right we take him with the sperm and
[37:56] that's right
[37:59] but he never chose
[38:09] the DNA can be run right back to the
[38:12] woman it's the same thing as well as the
[38:15] man we just want to make it that the
[38:19] male is the sperm and come on the eggs
[38:24] just as important because your profits
[38:27] when it said it
[38:27] the egg is what produced your body your
[38:32] body comes from the egg that the woman
[38:34] produced but it had to be quicker than
[38:38] made alive by the germ from the male you
[38:42] didn't pick and choose your children
[38:44] they are a part of you
[38:47] you can't deny they can run a DNA on you
[38:52] prove who's who woman or man they can
[38:58] prove who the mama is they prove who the
[39:00] daddy is you didn't pick and choose
[39:06] they're a part of you right now don't
[39:14] mean for you to shake your head yes or
[39:16] no or whatever to do whatever you want
[39:17] to do you gently stay quite anyway now
[39:19] lock it down what a lot of people like
[39:21] forever bind the corrugation horrid
[39:23] scream Amy I really don't you know why
[39:26] cuz you holler and scream amen and miss
[39:29] what I'm saying
[39:30] cuz you're not listening I'd rather you
[39:34] just sit there and listen when it
[39:38] strikes you'll raise your voice and say
[39:40] Amen when you see what I'm talking about
[39:43] your holler Amen you didn't pick your
[39:48] children your children are a part of you
[39:52] god never told Rijn he didn't create
[40:01] children
[40:08] his offspring is a part of him the many
[40:13] quotes if I give it to you about it
[40:18] God had you to be a part of women yep
[40:24] you had to be a part of God in the
[40:26] beginning
[40:29] not when you just chose down here he
[40:33] chose you are you ready so we better
[40:45] find out whether we're a part of him how
[40:48] can we ever be a part of him if we
[40:50] wasn't a part of him back there will
[40:51] never be a part of him here but if
[40:53] you're a part of him here with eternal
[40:54] life adore so then you were a part of
[40:56] him back there we're gonna get into the
[40:59] little something in a second I hope
[41:02] you'll catch it but listen he said the
[41:07] next message that was in the future home
[41:11] part graph 129 paragraph 257 of the same
[41:15] message
[41:16] only the predestinated will ever be the
[41:19] one who does it only can be and you only
[41:25] can do it because look it proves
[41:28] predestination because if you got
[41:32] eternal life you had to be a part of God
[41:38] all times because he's the only one is
[41:42] eternal
[41:49] I'm going to identify the masterpiece
[41:54] remember there's only one form of
[41:56] eternal life and our even our names and
[42:00] their thoughts were with God before
[42:03] there was a foundation of the world
[42:05] because now we possess eternal life and
[42:09] to be that we have to be a part of God
[42:15] so you'd have to be as much as in his
[42:20] thoughts because our cause we have
[42:26] eternal life and was predestinated to
[42:29] this life and to be a part of him go now
[42:37] what are you saying I'm saying Paul puts
[42:42] it in perfect order to express what
[42:44] Jesus is saying jesus said you never
[42:48] chose me I chose you you need not to
[42:52] wait he got over here to do it but when
[42:55] Paul picks it up he says you were chosen
[42:58] in him before the foundation of the
[43:00] world Paul's not correct in Peter I mean
[43:02] John and his writings in the words of
[43:05] Jesus he's telling you what he's saying
[43:12] he didn't choose us that's what I'm
[43:17] trying to get you to say we never want
[43:23] anyone you really blow it all I've ever
[43:24] understood is it right he didn't use his
[43:32] children they're a part of him that's
[43:36] how we're chosen that's why I kept
[43:38] emphasizing is the fact that we're
[43:41] chosen in him when I chose him because
[43:48] of something we done or didn't do we are
[43:55] his children where is our springs are
[43:58] trying to bring out
[44:01] and all Springs are not chosen well I
[44:11] just can't understand it what is it you
[44:13] can't understand somebody get up and
[44:15] tell me what you can't understand if we
[44:23] are in him if we have eternal life
[44:29] that life is a part of God right you
[44:33] agree that is a part of God was he
[44:36] didn't he didn't choose you go they tell
[44:40] you area chose me he chose you in him
[44:46] when he was chosen you were chosen in
[44:49] what was he chosen may I
[44:52] illustrate what was chosen before the
[44:56] world the great self-existing L am we
[44:59] call him the father in him was
[45:04] attributes attributes are his children I
[45:09] told you the other day to make sure you
[45:11] held on to that and good he had
[45:14] attributes to be a god right we said we
[45:20] got it all figured out he he created
[45:22] angels right we're right when he had
[45:26] attribute to be a father you know
[45:30] attributes to be a son he had attributes
[45:35] we only deal with the healer isn't a
[45:37] different night yet attributes for that
[45:41] what is an attribute it's a part of God
[45:45] a part of Almighty God if you have
[45:54] eternal life surely you would realize
[45:56] that life is a life of God he doesn't
[46:00] have to eternal life brethren said it
[46:07] well I thought I had to figure out go
[46:09] with Jimmy no he doesn't choose his
[46:13] children
[46:14] but they are his children he said you
[46:23] said he didn't choose me you didn't have
[46:27] to choose you now I will say this card
[46:30] we're gonna come down to it later he did
[46:32] choose a vessel you live in now you're
[46:37] gonna run up and down the line on that
[46:38] one right but I'm gonna quote brother
[46:41] round him to you for we start he said
[46:46] you're a great great great grandmother
[46:49] was red-headed and he said then there's
[46:56] no redheaded children in that he said
[47:01] but then you come as a redheaded child
[47:04] he said that comes straight from
[47:06] great-great-great-great grandmother
[47:11] letter Brown said now quoting he knows
[47:15] the very color of our hire he knowed all
[47:18] of our makeup he knows everything he
[47:21] knew that before the world
[47:22] he knows the body you will inhabit am i
[47:30] quoting him the body that you would
[47:33] inhabit he knew that before the world
[47:36] well because you wouldn't back her in
[47:38] the body before the world you were part
[47:41] of God when father God whatever you want
[47:50] to call him he stepped over into another
[47:53] form call the word the son of God
[48:00] songs that beginning go if you're
[48:03] listening to what I'm saying
[48:04] that son don't have the beginning that
[48:07] son was this Almighty God standing in
[48:09] another phone come on I know the message
[48:14] he said well it says revelation 3:14
[48:17] there's a greening of the grave that's
[48:18] the flesh of Jesus Christ the beginning
[48:21] of the creation of God was when Jesus
[48:23] Christ was created in flash that body
[48:25] had a beginning
[48:27] but that son of God never had a
[48:30] beginning he was God in another form the
[48:33] Holy Ghost is not another god it's God
[48:36] in another form don't you understand you
[48:48] see that way it's been you say yeah but
[48:51] look why was your prophet then you know
[48:58] what I'm fixing says true basically from
[49:00] 63 to 65 is your basics of the doctrines
[49:07] of predestination and you always was
[49:09] eternal and seeds dwelling in you
[49:12] because the opening of the seven seals
[49:16] right the opening of the seven seals
[49:20] brought the prophets message into view
[49:22] right because his message was not
[49:25] restorations in time it was not reforms
[49:31] it was the word of redemption nobody
[49:35] talked to redemption like this man
[49:37] that's why I love that scripture where
[49:40] they talking about Jesus and said no
[49:41] man's fight like you I'm saying about
[49:44] this prophet no man ever played like
[49:46] that yet are you gonna make him contrary
[49:50] one to the other are you gonna make all
[49:53] kind of now this you know yourself now
[49:55] get off of it and listen you know
[49:58] yourself what your mind is working on
[50:05] and you know yourself that you were
[50:09] thinking of picking and choosing but now
[50:15] you know it's open into another Avenue
[50:18] it's not picking and choosing we didn't
[50:25] choose him he chose us before the
[50:28] foundation of the world not chosen like
[50:31] trying to pick out a bunch of people it
[50:32] was back there he chose us and the fact
[50:35] that we were part of him the eternal
[50:38] life that we have not body spirit and
[50:40] soul of the human out
[50:41] there'll often they but by the new birth
[50:45] in our soul that eternal life is just as
[50:53] eternal is he he was cuz it is his life
[50:56] now are you sitting back before the
[50:59] world and letting God just look down
[51:02] then and can have him a wonderful time
[51:05] creating mankind and bringing into
[51:08] things that he could manifest his
[51:10] attributes and come over here at the end
[51:14] of it winding it up preaching to a group
[51:16] of people in the last days the great
[51:18] mysteries that the denominations never
[51:20] understood where is a one that would
[51:28] understand then he could say in one
[51:29] scripture that he chose us was saying
[51:32] another scripture then we were chosen in
[51:36] him and they come together that's for
[51:42] understanding
[51:56] see we say we say everybody that was
[52:03] ever say he was saved before the
[52:05] foundation of the world right is that
[52:08] true
[52:09] everybody had ever saved was saved
[52:11] before the foundation world when Jesus
[52:13] Christ stood as a lamb slain in every
[52:19] name it ever be was written to him right
[52:27] but then we try to make it that there's
[52:31] something different about us what about
[52:37] the foolish virgin
[52:41] they don't have eternal life to that
[52:44] they don't get eternal life to the white
[52:46] throne judgment right which you believe
[52:49] they'll get eternal life into our throne
[52:51] judgment do you well then how come God
[52:57] don't count them as basis always were
[52:59] saved
[53:03] if you account yourself he's always
[53:06] saved
[53:06] why wasn't the foolish virgin always
[53:09] saved you want to talk about a fifth
[53:13] seal Jude that has to be given eternal
[53:17] life why are they not talk about his
[53:25] being always was eternal goes in God's
[53:29] mind he knew everybody would ever get
[53:31] eternal life he said I come here with
[53:38] eternal life did the foolish virgin come
[53:44] with eternal life
[53:45] no okay you just trapped your own self
[53:49] you didn't know it I'll see if the
[53:51] foolish virgin didn't come here with
[53:52] eternal life how did you come here with
[53:54] eternal life oh I'm different that's
[53:59] where we're all that
[54:07] if I were saved before the world meaning
[54:12] then everybody that will go through the
[54:14] white throne everything would be
[54:16] finished before the world and God would
[54:19] know it or I'll be that away why do you
[54:24] want to make yourself come in with
[54:25] eternal life and everybody else don't
[54:27] get it somewheres else what about it I
[54:40] said we want to lay onto all of the
[54:43] quote from brother Branham I can do
[54:47] fewer they might tear on that internet
[54:48] now they're sitting in their studies
[54:50] listening this thing goes around the
[54:53] world you know we've done proved that
[54:55] brothers y'all show it to you in a hurry
[54:57] out of a hundred and seventy something
[54:59] countries this message used to be in a
[55:02] hundred and sixty something level from
[55:04] this church now you see him setting that
[55:09] Turkey
[55:10] boy he's wrong cuz I got all these
[55:14] quotes where brother Brennan said I come
[55:16] with eternal life but then you don't
[55:22] need salvation oh let's go one step
[55:26] further what does the word regain mean
[55:32] what does the word regain mean it means
[55:37] go back where you come from well how can
[55:44] you say I'm redeemed to say you're got
[55:49] to be redeemed you got to admit you've
[55:51] lost now you've got a lost eternal
[55:56] person it's what I told it to so people
[56:00] years ago that's been 40 years ago did
[56:04] you say God give you a soul the devil
[56:07] give your soul just kill the soul of the
[56:09] devil and God soul didn't need nothing I
[56:12] said according to my Bible the scripture
[56:14] says God won't dwell in an unclean
[56:16] vessel so you got guarding the devil
[56:18] living in you
[56:19] the same time and that's according to
[56:22] the Bible that won't work you know that
[56:24] didn't mean a thing
[56:29] you don't mean a thing on what I'm
[56:31] saying today if you're not gonna listen
[56:33] and privately pray in your own soul Lord
[56:36] let me understand what this man is
[56:38] saying because he keeps saying it over
[56:40] and over
[56:45] he keeps illustrating it over and over
[56:51] Lord opened my understanding so if you
[57:02] come with eternal life as a possession
[57:07] within you why did he not give it to the
[57:10] foolish person why did he not give it to
[57:14] the field field you a simple question
[57:24] was it just a knowledge that we come to
[57:29] is that your new birth just a knowledge
[57:34] to you then ball says we can have all of
[57:38] that and still belongs where with
[57:42] Nicodemus be the prophet said we were a
[57:51] part of God he said that's the only way
[57:57] you can have eternal life was to be a
[58:00] part of God so I hope you understand
[58:05] what I'm getting in I'm trying not
[58:10] to show you something I tried three
[58:13] months or four months ago to talk about
[58:18] that we say god this dwelt alone he was
[58:22] just some kind of a spirit just floating
[58:25] around and they just wouldn't nothing
[58:28] give it all alone you got to admit that
[58:34] before he ever created anything he had
[58:37] all of his attributes you agree with
[58:39] that he had his attributes before he
[58:41] started this way because brother Branham
[58:45] says his attributes are eternal and part
[58:48] of him but I don't understand that how
[58:51] could be an eternal healer I did it he
[58:56] just never had nothing to make it
[58:58] manifest
[59:02] well what about eternal life that's well
[59:07] I'm trying my best to get you to see he
[59:09] turned a life as a person in God before
[59:14] the world never had little identities
[59:16] little things floating around in him but
[59:20] he had every one of his attributes he
[59:22] never gained one attribute coming this
[59:24] away
[59:24] show me one that he ever gain I'll show
[59:27] you they were manifested by coming this
[59:29] way
[59:29] but he never gained an attribute coming
[59:32] this way he never received a child to
[59:45] make it eternal coming this way
[59:53] you don't lost me then if you were a
[1:00:00] part of him before the world then the
[1:00:08] eternal life you have in you now was
[1:00:10] what was back there not you not
[1:00:13] identities not people and not playing
[1:00:15] not souls we're gonna get to that yes
[1:00:24] your prophet said we were souls before
[1:00:26] the world you only have time to get it
[1:00:33] this morning we'll get to see that's
[1:00:34] good about where I can just take it on
[1:00:36] over to evening service what about it
[1:00:42] Church are you a part of God we're not
[1:00:52] talking about none of this junk can you
[1:00:58] tell me and I'll tell you and if you
[1:01:00] want names we'll call names ever
[1:01:03] doctrine it ever started about the two
[1:01:05] souls and all kind of thing
[1:01:06] wound up in polygamy why because it's so
[1:01:13] close
[1:01:17] it's the planting of a seed and that's
[1:01:19] so close until it's taken in the people
[1:01:23] of this message into polygamy you see
[1:01:28] why I walk very very soft because I know
[1:01:34] it what it can do I know what the
[1:01:37] devil's trying to do to stop me from
[1:01:39] preaching I know that and I never will
[1:01:45] because I can eat
[1:01:49] code I didn't call me and I didn't start
[1:01:52] it when he gets ready for me to quit you
[1:01:58] can kick his old ticker and take me out
[1:02:00] of the way and that's fine with me cuz
[1:02:02] I've done and I can meet him saying god
[1:02:04] I tried to get them people to realize
[1:02:08] who they are
[1:02:10] you realize you said what we need to
[1:02:12] know about the new birth
[1:02:13] what does it need to know about the new
[1:02:15] birth more than the fact that you and
[1:02:18] your children you understanding could be
[1:02:20] that if you receive the life of Jesus
[1:02:22] Christ within you in your soul that
[1:02:25] makes your soul eternal and that's
[1:02:27] redemption and that eternal life that
[1:02:31] you receive always was eternal and made
[1:02:34] you a part of God before the world ever
[1:02:36] begun made you a child of God
[1:02:44] well you're trying to make something
[1:02:46] pre-existent they the only thing that's
[1:02:48] pre-existing to me is eternal life i
[1:02:52] firm belief in pre-existent of eternal
[1:02:55] life but I also believe that Jesus
[1:03:00] Christ stood as a lamb slain before the
[1:03:02] foundation of the world right well what
[1:03:08] if he hadn't died 2,000 years ago on the
[1:03:10] cross why didn't he come into the world
[1:03:15] and say well it's all the knowledge
[1:03:16] anyway all I got to do is he gets kids
[1:03:18] in sciples to understand so I don't have
[1:03:20] to die do you realize what you're doing
[1:03:27] you realize if you bypass Calvary you're
[1:03:30] saying Calvary was false come on get
[1:03:36] your tops nienna tops if you've got the
[1:03:39] type of something the anti-type has got
[1:03:41] to be an exact fulfillment of that top
[1:03:44] because if not then your top is false
[1:03:47] prophecy you say what's that got to do
[1:03:54] with it he's got to do with one time
[1:03:57] although God before the world ever begun
[1:04:00] so Jesus Christ
[1:04:02] down Calvary he had to come to earth and
[1:04:05] fulfill that to release the life that
[1:04:09] was within him even though he saw you
[1:04:13] shouting according to jaw around in
[1:04:17] heaven before the world ever begun when
[1:04:21] the plan of redemption was to come and
[1:04:23] interview you've still got to come to
[1:04:26] earth as being lost and you got accept
[1:04:31] Jesus Christ as your Savior to have
[1:04:34] eternal life
[1:04:34] because if not you made your type
[1:04:37] greater than your answer top I don't
[1:04:41] mean a thing to you I know because
[1:04:42] that's this human but if you just listen
[1:04:49] see why don't you believe that God just
[1:04:53] only was just stepped over in another
[1:04:55] form same God Holy Ghost he stepped over
[1:05:03] in another form
[1:05:03] same God all the ghosts living in use
[1:05:06] the same guard he created the world the
[1:05:12] same going to create the world is the
[1:05:14] goddess living in you see that's why
[1:05:17] it's always eat something eternal look
[1:05:19] oh it's a part of God now maybe you've
[1:05:25] said along enough to work and pull back
[1:05:27] to the thought jesus said you never
[1:05:33] chose me I chose you Paul said we never
[1:05:41] chose him God chose us before the world
[1:05:47] because we were chosen in him you didn't
[1:05:53] do something good or bad to get
[1:05:55] salvation now how many of you children
[1:05:59] done something good to get to be have
[1:06:02] your parents as your mom and daddy well
[1:06:06] you sure are Carla now well is that
[1:06:09] sensible I mean brother Larry was this
[1:06:13] something you've done before he was ever
[1:06:15] born
[1:06:15] it made your mama
[1:06:17] have you you know none do it one of
[1:06:26] these days you'll understand while I
[1:06:27] profit will tell you and lay it down and
[1:06:30] show you that if you don't follow the
[1:06:33] Word of God your do's and don'ts will
[1:06:36] face you one day but then he'll turn
[1:06:38] right back around and preach you the
[1:06:40] gospel it says an unconditional covenant
[1:06:48] who would they don't matter what I do
[1:06:50] then you prove you're not a seed of God
[1:06:56] may I quote brother Branham for a second
[1:06:58] what about the African native that was
[1:07:05] on the farm in the olden days they had a
[1:07:10] whole bunch of slaves you know they'd
[1:07:13] beat them and everything else but had
[1:07:14] one slave he was always up doing you
[1:07:20] remember that story God said I want to
[1:07:23] buy him he said he's not for sale he
[1:07:26] said watch the difference you feed him
[1:07:27] differ don't you no no no don't do
[1:07:29] nothing said what is it said I used to
[1:07:34] wonder myself he said until I found out
[1:07:37] one day then over in his tribe in Africa
[1:07:41] his father was the king of the tribe and
[1:07:47] said he's the son of a king and no
[1:07:50] matter where he's at he's gonna act like
[1:07:56] the way we prove eternal life the way we
[1:08:00] prove whether we're saved or not is the
[1:08:02] life that we live and come on we're
[1:08:08] human enough and have a lot of failures
[1:08:21] love that scripture where Jesus had told
[1:08:23] that he said he signed you in you and me
[1:08:29] right you remember that Bible where
[1:08:32] Jesus said is I and you and you and me
[1:08:35] now when he said this I knew that's
[1:08:38] easier to understand because he can come
[1:08:39] live in us right but what about in you
[1:08:42] and me same God said I knew and you and
[1:08:48] me we talked about receiving eternal
[1:08:52] life could be enough but how was we in
[1:08:54] him we was part of the eternal life now
[1:08:58] are you back with me or how many times
[1:09:00] have I made this statement I don't want
[1:09:02] to be what God thought of coz he thought
[1:09:05] of Judas in the world and everything I
[1:09:07] want to be a part of the thinker himself
[1:09:12] the only way I could be a part of that
[1:09:15] is Paul said if the mind that was in
[1:09:17] Christ being you what he said do he said
[1:09:21] it make you a new creature it'll bring
[1:09:24] eternal life right into these vessels
[1:09:26] right here now you'll understand why
[1:09:36] brother Branham would say in the Bible
[1:09:37] would say we're not gonna become sons of
[1:09:40] God we are the sons of God you always
[1:09:51] was the son of God if you ever get
[1:09:54] eternal life as a new birth now I'm
[1:09:57] dividing it so you're not to hold me
[1:09:59] that's why your foolish virgin don't get
[1:10:02] a new birth she is an impartation of
[1:10:05] eternal life you feel sealed you does
[1:10:08] not get a new birth she's an impartation
[1:10:10] of eternal life even the 144,000 that
[1:10:14] receive eternal life here will not never
[1:10:17] be a part of the Bride of Christ
[1:10:20] they'll be servants to the bride is it
[1:10:26] odd then he would talk about Abraham and
[1:10:29] he said Abraham is my servant
[1:10:36] Abraham's his servant that you will
[1:10:40] never be nothing at that Old Testament
[1:10:42] you will never be nothing but servants
[1:10:48] even though they will be given eternal
[1:10:50] life there'll be servants you realize
[1:10:53] what it means to be a part of the body
[1:10:55] of Jesus Christ now I hope you'll follow
[1:10:59] me for a second see then we didn't
[1:11:04] choose him
[1:11:09] come on unless I need to quote from the
[1:11:12] Prophet did you say you saw God you saw
[1:11:14] God now run around him never said that
[1:11:17] you didn't cry and pray he said himself
[1:11:19] that he cried out and prayed to God know
[1:11:23] when he says you never saw God well I
[1:11:26] saw God
[1:11:27] you're not listening to the thought the
[1:11:33] only way you can seek God listen it's
[1:11:35] for God to be in you you don't know what
[1:11:39] you're seeking he's got to be in you who
[1:11:48] you don't know where the seeking parts
[1:11:50] that let's see what I'm blowing bubbles
[1:11:56] right because you're thinking in your
[1:11:58] mind little brother Brown I'm not yes
[1:12:01] what's he think let's see if I can quote
[1:12:03] how close I can get to I mean now
[1:12:06] brother Branham said dad brother Brennan
[1:12:09] said we never saw God but said I did no
[1:12:15] I did I cried and I prayed I fasted I've
[1:12:19] done everything seeking God and brother
[1:12:22] brother says I'd wasn't sinking him
[1:12:24] don't you understand he's telling you
[1:12:27] you not that you didn't crying for it
[1:12:29] he's telling you you didn't know how to
[1:12:31] seek God he knew you you saw him by your
[1:12:35] works you shouting by your prayers you
[1:12:38] sodium by you're not doing her doings
[1:12:40] you never saw him by where he says take
[1:12:44] my word and say from them
[1:12:47] what is down in the heart and I'll save
[1:12:50] you
[1:12:51] you see we say well I just don't believe
[1:12:54] rather random you understood he didn't
[1:12:56] understand me code ah
[1:12:57] I saw garden I remember when I cried I
[1:13:01] prayed and well there we I like to
[1:13:09] starve to death when I came in this
[1:13:10] message could I realized I didn't have
[1:13:13] God I realized I wouldn't born again the
[1:13:23] way he's talking about it
[1:13:24] but I had God in my heart not same time
[1:13:27] not same God I'd say angel time you know
[1:13:31] kind of things when he talked about the
[1:13:35] new birth I realized I didn't have what
[1:13:37] are you talking about I know what it
[1:13:41] means to seek God and cry out before him
[1:13:45] but I know a lot of times I'm honest and
[1:13:48] you listen to me a lot of that gets in
[1:13:51] your way because you think well what
[1:13:56] else can I do God and we have prayed
[1:13:58] that prayer sister Anne are you looking
[1:14:00] at me you prayed it a dozen times
[1:14:02] yesterday can I hit it
[1:14:04] mm-hmm we think we saw God but it was
[1:14:10] really God seeking us see we don't know
[1:14:13] the Bible the Bible says the goodness of
[1:14:18] God leads us to repentance
[1:14:22] that's Bible what led you to seek after
[1:14:26] God His goodness to call you he was
[1:14:29] searching for you Adam in the garden or
[1:14:34] art thou now you won't brother branham
[1:14:38] that's where I love the message see that
[1:14:41] way Eunice yeah have you ever heard
[1:14:43] brother run say this Adam and Eve you've
[1:14:47] done the wrong right and they put on
[1:14:51] them fig leaves now can I quote brother
[1:14:55] on him
[1:14:56] he said they were back in the bushes
[1:14:58] heaven church
[1:15:00] do you need that quote who Adam and Eve
[1:15:04] was back in the bushes having Church now
[1:15:10] that's better Browns worse you look at
[1:15:11] what Adam and he was doing but then God
[1:15:14] come along as it had my heart now he was
[1:15:20] in church what were they doing when they
[1:15:24] were sitting back there don't you think
[1:15:26] he was feeling bad about what she had
[1:15:29] done
[1:15:29] I mean don't you think she just had a
[1:15:33] relationship with an animal and you
[1:15:34] think this that she wouldn't live back
[1:15:36] there with Adams then had him on sorry I
[1:15:38] I gotta call him she was crying he would
[1:15:41] she was praying she never charged but
[1:15:45] her church wouldn't take it or nowhere
[1:15:48] see our crying out didn't take us
[1:15:51] anywhere
[1:15:51] it's where God was seeking after us he's
[1:15:58] him seeking us when we thought we're
[1:15:59] seeking Him what caused you to cry and
[1:16:01] pray you thought is you wasn't who's God
[1:16:06] you understand God was causing us to cry
[1:16:10] out brother branham's not against you
[1:16:13] seeking God remember what he said he
[1:16:20] said now Lord I've heard people say you
[1:16:22] need to get down pray that's what you
[1:16:24] need you do this you need to do that
[1:16:26] after a while he finally stowed
[1:16:28] everything down and said Lord just save
[1:16:34] me something struck and he said goes
[1:16:38] running down a railroad track God found
[1:16:45] a man no God found a man
[1:16:50] God's been waiting on you God's been
[1:16:57] waiting on you and me
[1:17:04] - yeah but you seem like that you make
[1:17:05] salvation that's God giving to you
[1:17:15] eternal life into a human vessel then
[1:17:20] you tell me what it is if that ain't
[1:17:22] what it is who justifies you who
[1:17:30] sanctifies you yeah but I didn't know
[1:17:32] you had to do that
[1:17:33] well they don't wonder if you're saved
[1:17:35] and I just come into message I believe
[1:17:38] the messenger prays God but remember the
[1:17:42] devil does - I'm trying to make
[1:17:47] salvation not just a flimsy flimsy thing
[1:17:50] been making it a part that everything in
[1:17:53] the Bible will fit together you know
[1:17:55] listen for a second than that come on
[1:17:57] musician you know that brother branham
[1:17:59] talking to evidence of the Holy Ghost
[1:18:05] you realize he talked the evidence the
[1:18:08] Holy Ghost was love you realized you
[1:18:11] want these quote you realize he taught
[1:18:13] in the evidence the Holy Ghost was gifts
[1:18:16] and signs and wonders
[1:18:17] he never said there's anything wrong
[1:18:20] with you just believing he never done
[1:18:29] away with all of those things when he
[1:18:32] said the evidence of the Holy Ghost is
[1:18:34] whether or not the spirit in you agrees
[1:18:40] with the word now you've got ever
[1:18:44] evidence love is a part of the evidence
[1:18:47] of God gifts is a part of an evidence of
[1:18:50] God your believing is a part of the
[1:18:54] evidence of God but it's summed up by
[1:18:56] finality realizing who you are and that
[1:19:01] that went inside of you is the one who
[1:19:04] saves you he's the one that's guided you
[1:19:07] he's the one that takes care of you he's
[1:19:11] the one that leads you
[1:19:14] because you're his child then we want to
[1:19:20] make it on something that we can get a
[1:19:24] big thing or a feeling about instead of
[1:19:27] just believing instead of taking a
[1:19:34] simple parable and it says the parable
[1:19:41] of the sower of the seed number 1 he
[1:19:45] said the son of man was a so where the
[1:19:46] seeds right so that put it back our
[1:19:52] number 2 this good seed is the seed of
[1:19:57] the children of the kingdom what if he
[1:20:03] didn't outfielder in order to come from
[1:20:07] like I've tried to get you to see it I
[1:20:11] come with a seed in me when was it put
[1:20:14] time what do you mean I come into world
[1:20:20] with it
[1:20:21] when did the Prophet say it was put tire
[1:20:24] he said it was put in there before the
[1:20:27] foundation of the world
[1:20:30] now tell me it's something good you
[1:20:33] don't or didn't do or what you went
[1:20:34] through to get all of it and come up in
[1:20:36] the seed and everything yeah he said it
[1:20:38] was put in you before the foundation of
[1:20:39] the world that's what we're not really
[1:20:45] we're not thinking in the morning stars
[1:20:48] sang together in the sons of God shouted
[1:20:49] for joy those angels are the ministering
[1:20:54] spirits men brought in to minister to
[1:20:57] the heirs of salvation is that right
[1:20:59] that's a scripture that's why they were
[1:21:01] shouting in hollered but the sons and
[1:21:03] daughters of God saw the plan of
[1:21:06] redemption what they saw they were going
[1:21:09] to come to earth and wind up in a lost
[1:21:15] condition
[1:21:20] but they saw that God was gonna come to
[1:21:24] earth to and he is gonna redeem every
[1:21:27] child he had take you back where he come
[1:21:32] from and that's why I keep trying to say
[1:21:35] it to you if you'd listen just listen at
[1:21:37] all
[1:21:38] you said I'm a thought well what if
[1:21:43] there's something back further than a
[1:21:44] thought and you start with a thought of
[1:21:48] something well we got really listening
[1:21:58] we'll try to get into more this
[1:22:00] afternoon because I want you to see you
[1:22:04] talk about choosing you never ever knew
[1:22:07] you going at your choosing you've got
[1:22:09] this going God didn't choose you you are
[1:22:13] him are you never will be if you have
[1:22:17] eternal life that eternal life is God a
[1:22:19] part of Almighty God he never had to
[1:22:22] pick it out it's a part of him it's his
[1:22:24] children all he needed now listen and
[1:22:33] listen to careful all he needed was the
[1:22:37] other part of John 1 what does a father
