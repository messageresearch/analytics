[8:30] we desire more than anything else we ask

[8:36] in your word that you sent your word and
[8:37] healed us and delivered us from

[9:06] we commit it to you now and guide us in
[9:08] Jesus name
[9:12] Amen in Zechariah
[9:16] 4 and the angel that talked with me came
[9:19] again and wake me as a man that is
[9:21] wakened out of his sleep and he said
[9:23] unto me what seest thou and I said I
[9:26] have looked and behold a Candlestick all
[9:28] of gold with a bowl upon the top of it
[9:31] and his seven lamps thereof that and
[9:34] seven pipes to the seven lamps which are
[9:36] upon the top thereof and two olive trees
[9:39] by it one upon the right side of The
[9:41] Bold and the other upon the left side
[9:43] thereof so I answered and spake to the
[9:45] angel that talk with me saying what are
[9:48] these my Lord remember these are
[9:49] symbolics so he's wanting to
[9:52] know then he answered and spake unto me
[9:54] saying this is the word of the Lord unto
[9:57] zerubabel saying not by might nor by
[10:01] power but by my spirit sayith the Lord
[10:03] of hosts who art thou oh great Mountain
[10:07] before zeru Thou shalt become a plain
[10:10] and he shall bring forth a headstone
[10:11] thereof shouting crying Grace Grace unto
[10:15] it now let's just stop there on that one
[10:18] and because that's where we're getting
[10:20] to then we will just use part of the
[10:22] verse
[10:24] n of 2
[10:27] Corinthians 12
[10:29] and he said unto me my grace is
[10:33] sufficient for thee you may be seated
[10:36] the Lord had his Blessing to the reading
[10:38] of the word
[10:41] now we've been
[10:44] speaking about
[10:47] the displaying of God's
[10:50] attributes and uh I hope you've enjoyed
[10:52] it maybe we may have another message
[10:55] this afternoon but we'll just have to
[10:57] wait and see uh on this part and and
[11:01] then I want to and one reason for
[11:03] reading Zachariah is it's talking of the
[11:07] candlesticks and the things and if you'd
[11:09] like to read ahead of me and and things
[11:12] read the first chapter of Revelations
[11:15] and we'll try to get into because I've
[11:17] had it kind of a thought to speak about
[11:20] the Sevenfold Glory of his person am you
[11:23] know so we may try to go into that uh
[11:26] either this afternoon or next Sunday the
[11:28] Lord will
[11:30] but we've been talking about
[11:33] Redemption and we've seen from our
[11:35] life's message on talking on the
[11:38] displaying of God's
[11:40] attributes because we know that that's
[11:43] what he's doing still is doing been
[11:46] doing amen from the beginning is
[11:49] displaying his attributes attributes is
[11:51] what you are you're you're uh you know
[11:54] you are the attribute of your parents
[11:56] you're uh you know uh when you use using
[11:59] the word attribute it just simply means
[12:01] it the product and we know that God
[12:04] before the world ever
[12:06] begun that he had a plan and a purpose
[12:10] to uh come into view all right and in
[12:15] doing that then he would uh tie it up
[12:20] into his entire word and bring it forth
[12:23] to uh bring us the understanding of that
[12:28] what he's doing he didn't intend for man
[12:30] to
[12:32] fall because that would not be his uh
[12:36] you can't bring that out of God because
[12:37] there's no way to bring out a a fall out
[12:39] of an eternal God but yet he knew by the
[12:43] creating of man in the way that he
[12:46] created us and giving us free moral
[12:49] agency he knew that we would fall amen
[12:53] that was his understanding and then by
[12:55] doing that then he could display his
[12:57] attributes cuz had in him an attribute
[13:00] to be a savior well there was nothing
[13:02] lost he had an attribute of being a
[13:05] Healer but there was nothing sick or
[13:07] nothing so he permitted the fall to come
[13:11] into being not causing it you can't say
[13:15] well God made me this way no no he
[13:18] didn't make us this way we are free
[13:20] moral agents we make ourselves the way
[13:23] we are you can't blame him for something
[13:26] that we do when we come to the age of a
[13:28] kind of ability we don't blame Adam and
[13:31] Eve for what happened Amen to you and I
[13:34] that started the ball rolling but yet
[13:36] you and I are the problem with the rest
[13:38] of it all right so then in doing that he
[13:42] could by permitting us to fall he could
[13:45] display those attributes all right then
[13:48] he could come forth and be what he
[13:51] desired to be as I said a savior A
[13:55] Healer and things he could do those
[13:58] things and we watched his attributes as
[14:00] they displayed down through the
[14:03] scriptures and we've seen that and came
[14:06] down to the end time to where we're at
[14:10] that we are to be talking about the full
[14:12] Plan of Redemption you know being
[14:15] redeemed all right and that one of his
[14:19] attributes was that he would
[14:23] display and that's what we want to talk
[14:25] about today for a little bit is I
[14:28] believe the greatest attribute that God
[14:30] has so that's that's my thought his
[14:34] greatest attribute is his grace amen all
[14:38] right Grace is the greatest attributes
[14:41] because without Grace there would have
[14:44] not been any other attribute right right
[14:47] amen he would have not been displaying
[14:48] anything else had he not knew and saw
[14:52] what would take place and I said he knew
[14:54] we would fall right all right but he
[14:59] already had the in mind what he was
[15:03] going to
[15:04] do so as quick as man fail he comes down
[15:09] to start restoring man or redeeming man
[15:13] or to bring man back whatever you want
[15:15] to use all right and to do that see he's
[15:19] displaying his greatest attribute which
[15:22] is
[15:23] Grace now it's not disgrace see that's
[15:26] what we look at we we had the old baptis
[15:29] Doctrine we called it disgrace cuz we
[15:31] said it don't make no difference what I
[15:32] do I'm saved anyway now that's disgrace
[15:35] that's that's going into the wrong form
[15:38] of of understanding uh Grace truly is
[15:42] unmar favor right but it is not just a
[15:47] garbage can to throw out and just say
[15:50] well you can just live the way you want
[15:51] to do whatever because you saved anyway
[15:54] well that just goes to prove you're not
[15:55] saved that's that's a good point you're
[15:58] just it's not even saved to start with
[16:00] see but Grace is a display of his
[16:03] attributes and like I said now all of
[16:05] his attributes then relates to
[16:10] Grace you know where it be Advocate uh
[16:13] Rose of Sharon L the valley bright and
[16:15] Morning Star Alpha and Omega whatever
[16:17] you want to call and do and Redeemer you
[16:21] know whatever is a part of displaying
[16:25] that
[16:26] attribute that he had within him right
[16:30] which was Grace that's the simple point
[16:32] I'm trying to make it to where we'll
[16:34] think about it to to think about
[16:39] Grace as it says here in the scripture
[16:42] that The Headstone would come crying
[16:44] Grace Grace unto it amen all right
[16:48] now The Headstone is coming crying Grace
[16:51] Grace but you know what we we better
[16:53] have the same understanding to display
[16:57] back toward him right amen all right see
[17:00] then it can't be just well it don't make
[17:02] no difference what I do you know no
[17:05] that's going into disgrace right amen
[17:08] all right that's putting us into the
[17:09] wrong category and that's not a display
[17:12] of his grace that's a display of our
[17:14] disgrace right amen because that's
[17:17] that's what we wind up being right you
[17:19] know in total disgrace but now what
[17:21] about a product called
[17:24] Grace you
[17:26] know how old is Grace
[17:31] well see if you listening to what I just
[17:33] said Grace came first
[17:35] amen amen Grace was in the thoughts of
[17:39] God's mind amen it is not a new doctrine
[17:43] or a new idea or it wasn't something
[17:45] that the Baptist came along and picked
[17:47] up the message of Grace and know tried
[17:49] to bring it out and and messed a lot of
[17:52] it up but still they done a good job
[17:55] best they could but see grace
[17:59] was before the world
[18:01] Amen because Grace
[18:04] now caused him to
[18:08] display those
[18:10] attributes all right so he knew we'd
[18:14] fall he knew he created man he put us in
[18:17] the garden give us a
[18:19] choice he knew we'd fall all right but
[18:24] see then he already knew what he was
[18:26] going to do right
[18:30] you you got to admit that that he if
[18:32] he's God if there is a God or whatever
[18:34] you want to talk about God and doing
[18:37] then see if your God is not strong
[18:39] enough to know before the world what
[18:41] would take place upon the Earth after we
[18:43] came into the Earth then what kind of a
[18:45] god do you have all right see then Grace
[18:52] is what God look
[18:57] down and I've always said he kind
[19:00] of I guess we call it had
[19:03] Amnesia you know because God can
[19:08] forgive and
[19:10] forget amen we can
[19:13] forgive
[19:15] maybe but we can't
[19:17] forget but he can forget it amen now so
[19:22] now that would have to be a product of
[19:24] his grace
[19:26] amen that he could
[19:29] know what was going to
[19:33] happen know what we was going to
[19:36] do but yet he could still bring us into
[19:39] being
[19:43] right and then as we fall
[19:47] see he could come to restore back the
[19:51] bringing all right now then in this day
[19:56] as Paul says we were on like Sunday
[19:59] there
[20:01] Wednesday see as Paul would be covering
[20:03] to the Romans
[20:05] that the whole world is
[20:09] waiting for the manifestation of the
[20:11] sons of God Amen
[20:14] right now because the world is waiting
[20:18] on its Master
[20:20] amen all right so then in doing that
[20:24] then God is waiting on you and I amen
[20:28] right
[20:30] to come to the position to believe who
[20:32] we are and what we're here for
[20:36] right amen if
[20:38] you uh ever thought about well what am I
[20:42] doing in the world you know well you're
[20:44] here for a reason cuz God does nothing
[20:47] without a reason so then he's put us
[20:50] here for a purpose all right we are the
[20:53] people that the Bible says the end of
[20:55] all things has come upon now if you
[20:57] don't believe you're end of the world
[20:59] then just get your newspaper and read a
[21:01] little bit and sit down with common
[21:03] sense and you'll find it out in a hurry
[21:06] what's going on around the world it's
[21:08] falling apart how long it'll take that's
[21:11] none of our business because it ain't
[21:12] into us to do that and what good would
[21:15] it do to
[21:17] know you know you would you'd be like
[21:20] the guy was that tell you about that got
[21:23] the newspaper fictitional story got a
[21:25] newspaper a day ahead of time you know
[21:27] and he was doing good because he could
[21:29] win the horse races he could he'd know
[21:31] what was going to happen every day but
[21:33] then one day he read the obituary and
[21:35] found out he died the day before so that
[21:38] would put us into a problem all right
[21:41] see there's no need of trying to figure
[21:43] out what's going on is to try to just be
[21:46] ready against that day the Bible says
[21:49] all right now we talk about things and
[21:53] putting it in a perspective of
[21:56] redemption so then
[21:59] Paul says to the Romans
[22:01] that you know the full Redemption is to
[22:05] come in
[22:06] sunship are the position of where that
[22:09] the children of God would realize who
[22:11] they are what they're doing
[22:14] here and we're here for a purpose amen
[22:18] all right we're here to bring about the
[22:22] end of all things right okay now so then
[22:27] why don't we believe that that and
[22:30] accept it to find ourselves in the word
[22:33] amen all right
[22:37] now so Grace
[22:39] being is older than the world
[22:44] Amen and he said he wrote our names in
[22:46] the lounge book of life before the
[22:47] foundation of the world right amen so
[22:50] that would be Grace
[22:51] amen but that was because what we were
[22:53] looking at last night that God doesn't
[22:55] predestinate by his desires he PR
[22:58] destinat by his for knowledge so by his
[23:01] for knowledge he could look down through
[23:03] time and know that you would be here
[23:06] this
[23:07] morning and that's no nothing pulling
[23:10] over on him he knew we'd be here and he
[23:13] knew what we'd be doing this day and and
[23:16] all like that before the world or
[23:18] something's wrong with your God I'd
[23:19] trade it off and get me something else
[23:21] if it wouldn't you know if that wasn't
[23:23] right I'd find a God that was really
[23:27] understanding but see then he
[23:31] knows what we are and what we're doing
[23:35] all
[23:36] right and in doing it that Grace would
[23:42] produce the attribute right are you
[23:45] following me right amen see grace then
[23:48] would produce what would be
[23:51] needed all right so Mankind in the
[23:55] garden when he sinned what was needed
[24:01] it was needed that God come
[24:06] down and make a
[24:08] way to redeem the man that had fallen
[24:13] all right so then as he
[24:16] does he starts displaying that
[24:20] attribute that he made the
[24:25] atonement Grace came first
[24:28] amen all right and he made the
[24:32] atonement to where that we
[24:35] could accepted or rejected and gave us
[24:38] that
[24:39] right but he knew what was going to take
[24:43] place but see then he could display that
[24:46] by offering these sacrifices
[24:49] himself because
[24:52] remember Adam and Eve had sinned they
[24:55] had their own ways figured out and their
[24:57] own doings
[24:59] but when they did God had to come down
[25:01] and kill those animals and cover them
[25:03] with skin because it had to be a blood
[25:06] atonement right all right so then God
[25:10] displayed his attribute of
[25:13] grace before mankind there in the garden
[25:17] to the point that he made a way amen
[25:21] Right and started his Plan of Redemption
[25:24] amen all
[25:26] right and see then from from then on
[25:29] everything the point I want you to
[25:31] get is from the time of the garden and
[25:35] we talk about
[25:36] Grace then to me the whole
[25:40] Bible is Grace
[25:43] amen all right that's the grace of God
[25:46] Amen to you and I like the prophet of
[25:48] God said one day he said my whole makeup
[25:50] is grac am well that should be all of us
[25:54] now not
[25:55] disgrace disgrace is totally opposite
[25:57] from
[26:01] Grace Grace is the love of God that's
[26:04] been displayed
[26:05] amen disgrace is what we take and do
[26:08] with it mess it up all
[26:12] right but you see
[26:15] grace would have to said be the
[26:18] product and then we would talk about
[26:21] Hebrews
[26:23] 138 that it's Jesus Christ the same
[26:25] yesterday amen today amen amen and
[26:29] forever all right so then his whole
[26:34] makeup would be grace to you and
[26:38] I but what do we think about
[26:43] that do we think Grace is some new
[26:46] doctrine some idea somebody came up
[26:49] with or do we look back and see that it
[26:52] is actually the producing of the entire
[26:57] Bible everything in the Bible's
[27:01] Grace no no we got this year thing
[27:04] called the law well see the law was
[27:06] never intended to be
[27:09] brought now that may shock some to think
[27:12] that God wrote the law and but man chose
[27:15] law in Exodus
[27:17] 19 he said give us something to do and
[27:21] God brought a law into
[27:23] existence it was never his full intent
[27:25] to bring that law
[27:28] because you don't need law when you're
[27:30] under
[27:32] grace right see that's where we mess up
[27:34] by our own
[27:37] choosing right you said when I wasn't
[27:40] back there no we wouldn't back there but
[27:43] by our representation of them before
[27:46] us we wouldn't in the garden the fall
[27:50] but because the fall came it brought us
[27:52] under the fall agree all right see then
[27:55] they wanted law Israel did because they
[27:58] wanted something to do they couldn't be
[28:00] satisfied just being the people of God
[28:03] that's
[28:05] right so they wanted something to
[28:09] do give us a
[28:12] law all right but see they didn't get
[28:14] what they thought that's where I like
[28:16] the prophet in his definition of he said
[28:19] they didn't get what they wanted or
[28:21] thought about they thought they'd got a
[28:22] book of rules to make them
[28:24] right you don't do this you don't do
[28:27] that you don't do this tell us what to
[28:29] do but see it should have never been
[28:31] that way you know why because
[28:36] Grace provided them an atonement in the
[28:42] garden without a bunch of
[28:46] works I mean there's no you know plain
[28:49] language now you read your Bible there's
[28:52] nowhere in the Bible it says Adam and
[28:53] Eve even
[28:55] repented that's right right that's right
[28:58] come on I'm sure they did but it's not
[29:02] in the
[29:04] word they didn't come out repented they
[29:06] come out trying to figure everything out
[29:09] they came out with a fig Leaf
[29:11] gospel because once they found out what
[29:13] wrong they made them some coverage
[29:15] remember from the Fig leaves that's
[29:17] right all right you know see it wasn't
[29:21] they were trying to
[29:22] repent right it was trying to get around
[29:26] right or a
[29:29] Pease what they thought was an Angry God
[29:34] right well was God
[29:41] angry I'll let you think about it it
[29:44] don't sound like he was he was doing
[29:46] everything he could to cover the
[29:52] mankind so he didn't wind up with saying
[29:54] well I'm angry at you sure he's angry at
[29:57] sin right but he wasn't angry at the
[30:02] products right he didn't even curse Adam
[30:05] he didn't curse Eve he cursed the Earth
[30:07] and made it to
[30:09] things all right so then in doing that
[30:13] see he was trying to display his grace
[30:15] but what does mankind want something to
[30:20] do tuck him some fig leaves solded them
[30:23] together made them some
[30:25] close God said that won't work
[30:29] that's right take them clothes off throw
[30:31] them back over in the
[30:32] bushes get in the bushes and put these
[30:34] skins
[30:36] on because it had to be blood right amen
[30:40] because we know the story of what would
[30:41] happened in the garden it was blood and
[30:43] and it had to be blood to atone right
[30:45] amen but my point is to get you to think
[30:47] about Grace in a way that maybe
[30:52] uh you
[30:56] know there was no Grace in the
[31:00] law now we're going to go two points so
[31:03] listen there was no Grace in the
[31:07] law laws a policeman to put you in
[31:10] jail right so why in the world would
[31:12] they want a bunch of
[31:15] rules there's no Grace in the law
[31:18] right none whatsoever Paul said the law
[31:22] was added because of
[31:24] transgression and they sinned and they
[31:26] wanted something as I said about about
[31:28] the Fig leaves to try to appease God and
[31:31] they wanted some way of trying to
[31:33] satisfy God and they said well God give
[31:35] us some rules to
[31:37] keep yeah and they couldn't keep
[31:40] them and they didn't keep them n and we
[31:43] don't keep
[31:45] them
[31:47] right but you see it's trying to in some
[31:50] way appease right God don't want to be
[31:54] appeased he wants to be believed amen
[31:57] all right
[31:58] now then Grace now listen to what I'm
[32:01] saying there was no Grace in the law the
[32:02] law put you in
[32:05] jail he says you're guilty well why
[32:07] would you want
[32:10] that why would the children of Israel
[32:12] want a book of rules to keep
[32:16] right they just put them in
[32:19] jail Paul said that the knowledge of sin
[32:23] come because of the law because the law
[32:26] said Thou shalt not covet
[32:30] it just brought out into the open the
[32:32] man that thought he had something to
[32:34] satisfy God right that he could do it
[32:38] brought him more out in the open than it
[32:39] did to start
[32:43] with now listen to what I'm saying
[32:45] there's no Grace in the
[32:47] law
[32:49] right all
[32:51] right but there was Grace before the
[32:56] law during the law law and after the
[33:00] law that the way the prophet says it
[33:03] that's is called
[33:05] Paradox Grace was before the
[33:10] law during the law and after the law
[33:14] that sounds contradictory doesn't it
[33:16] where he's the one that says there's no
[33:17] Grace in the
[33:19] law it puts you in
[33:21] jail all right but see there's no Grace
[33:25] in the law it does that it condemns
[33:28] but during the time the law was in
[33:32] existence the grace of God was there
[33:36] right right amen so it's correct amen
[33:40] there's no Grace in the law but during
[33:43] the
[33:44] law before the law came into existence
[33:47] it was already
[33:49] Grace Grace came first it wasn't a
[33:52] law see you ask most people they say
[33:54] well to lock it no Grace came first
[33:57] right
[34:01] see the law was added because of the
[34:03] transgression of the
[34:05] mankind something he
[34:07] wanted but Grace had already provided
[34:10] what they needed
[34:13] amen
[34:15] right now so we think about it this
[34:19] way on one side you look at the and a
[34:24] prophet that was to be sent
[34:28] and from one side in one quoting of what
[34:30] you want you can see that a prophet is a
[34:34] sign of
[34:40] Destruction a prophet is a sign of the
[34:44] Judgment of God
[34:46] right
[34:49] right Noah being a
[34:53] prophet he was a sign of a coming
[34:56] judgment right
[34:58] all
[35:00] right but to his
[35:04] family and the
[35:07] animals and the
[35:10] Ark he was a sign of
[35:14] Deliverance so now which way do we want
[35:16] it when you got both sides to quote
[35:22] from and it's true to a nation to the
[35:26] nation of America
[35:29] this last day Prophet was a judgment
[35:31] sign
[35:32] right but to the bride of Christ what
[35:35] was he
[35:36] amen amen right are you following me
[35:40] Amen to the world in the days of
[35:45] Noah a prophet meant death
[35:52] judgment but at the same time
[35:59] the flood that destroyed the
[36:01] world was what Noah floated out
[36:04] on right amen so I'm sure his family
[36:08] liked the grace don't you
[36:11] amen and as I said the animals that was
[36:13] put in the ark brought over with him
[36:17] right but see can we get it together to
[36:19] H to bring it into the right
[36:23] order and that way we can quote one
[36:25] quote it says that there's no Grace in
[36:27] the law but then we can quote the other
[36:30] one that says during the time of the
[36:33] law Grace was
[36:37] there a Prophet was Grace to the people
[36:41] cuz that's the way they heard from
[36:43] God is that Amos 3 and 7 he does nothing
[36:47] does he reveals it to his servants a
[36:50] prophet so a prophet then is a sign of
[36:55] Destruction to one and a sign of
[36:58] Deliverance to the other
[37:00] amen all right and you know that he's
[37:06] Grace see the children of Israel needed
[37:08] a deliverer amen God could have sent
[37:11] down a pillar of fire he did but I mean
[37:14] I mean he could have just done it that
[37:16] way he could have went down there and
[37:17] Zapped everyone of the uh the Pharaoh
[37:20] and the Egyptians and
[37:23] and but that wasn't his way of doing it
[37:27] because you know why because that would
[37:29] have been for
[37:31] everybody right
[37:35] y but see it wasn't for
[37:38] everybody right
[37:41] amen come
[37:44] on I said it to start with then God
[37:47] didn't make us be what we are we made
[37:49] our choices we made our doings we've
[37:52] decided ourselves what we are we've made
[37:55] ourselves sinners
[37:58] right but see God's grace to Israel was
[38:02] a
[38:03] prophet you remember Samuel the
[38:06] prophet and they said make us a king he
[38:09] said what do you need a king
[38:11] for read your Bible what do you need a
[38:14] king for amen oh we want to be like the
[38:17] Nations around
[38:21] us well what did you need that
[38:25] far Samuel could stand up and say listen
[38:28] where did God ever fail to tell me what
[38:30] you have need of have not we W ever
[38:33] battle have not we have not God taken
[38:35] care of
[38:41] everything because a prophet then is a
[38:48] sign now this will be for later on when
[38:51] we get back to
[38:52] it isn't it
[38:55] odd now the first is is the the the
[38:58] typing of the
[39:00] Messiah which was you know the the
[39:02] atonement right I mean that that
[39:05] atonement back in Garden when it was
[39:07] made was typing Christ am which would be
[39:10] our savior Our Redeemer or all and all
[39:13] but isn't it odd that he started off and
[39:15] this is my
[39:17] thought he started off
[39:21] with allowing a prophet to come
[39:28] and that Prophet would be his grace
[39:34] right and then it odd he ends up with a
[39:37] prophet to come you
[39:42] know showing its Grace from the
[39:44] beginning all the way to the end amen
[39:49] right
[39:51] right are you
[39:53] listening when he first made his contact
[39:56] with a man he made the T that speaks of
[39:59] Christ but then immediately he comes
[40:01] through with Noah Enoch Etc the
[40:05] different
[40:06] ones as the prophets that the word of
[40:10] God come
[40:12] to and why would you want anything
[40:15] else I mean how would you feel if You'
[40:18] have been
[40:20] Moses and Moses was out there and they
[40:22] had no problems and you everything was
[40:24] running wonderful and people come along
[40:26] and say
[40:28] you know we want a
[40:33] law we want a book of
[40:36] rules go up there and find out we
[40:39] believe you would you just go find out
[40:42] what God wants us to
[40:44] do how would you
[40:48] feel I know what I'd have
[40:51] done I'd have got my coat and hat and
[40:53] headed back to the Wilderness you know
[40:56] what I mean right
[40:58] i' left them why because they were
[41:00] spitting in his face just like I said
[41:02] about
[41:04] Samuel give us a leader so what do you
[41:08] need a leader for I'm your
[41:12] leader but we want
[41:15] something
[41:17] ourselves you know what the prophet of
[41:19] God said about him the problem
[41:22] was he said God knew and they'd start
[41:24] bowing down and giving reverence and
[41:27] respect to those kings that it would be
[41:30] the same thing that would come on
[41:32] over later to the Catholic church and
[41:35] bow down and kiss the Pope's toe right
[41:37] or go up and and shake hands with the
[41:39] preacher and say you're saved yeah you
[41:41] know
[41:42] whatever see it would start the order of
[41:45] bowing
[41:48] worship God don't want no worship like
[41:51] that he wants worship from an honest and
[41:53] a contrite heart he doesn't want our
[41:56] rules and Dr regulations and our doings
[41:58] and things am he wants us to believe
[42:02] him all
[42:04] right are you are you getting my point
[42:06] see that we'd say well there was no
[42:09] Grace in the law there
[42:12] wasn't because it was what man
[42:16] chose it was not God's original plan to
[42:19] give that
[42:20] law what did he need a law
[42:25] for and like he said to
[42:27] you know Samuel went told him said
[42:29] listen what do you want a king
[42:32] for said don't you know he's going to
[42:35] start taking your your kids away from
[42:37] you and he's going to start taking the
[42:38] money away from you and he's going to
[42:40] have to have something to run all this
[42:41] stuff with you know just plain language
[42:45] and said he's going to start doing all
[42:46] these
[42:48] things and said ain't everything's
[42:50] running good
[42:53] down
[42:55] well I said he parted with
[43:02] mankind of not wanting to give them a
[43:06] law because they already had Grace what
[43:10] a dis disrespect to God could it
[43:16] be that he had told him there in Exodus
[43:18] 19 read it he said you're are chosen
[43:21] people you're a royal priesthood
[43:28] right say anything that you needed that
[43:31] I didn't get for you right I fought all
[43:35] your battles I've done everything I've
[43:38] taken care of
[43:40] you and you you want something to
[43:43] do well you know that's just Mankind we
[43:46] we just can't help it we just can't help
[43:49] to think about that God could save us
[43:53] without us doing
[43:55] something like we talking about last
[43:56] night
[43:57] maybe something we done or something we
[43:59] didn't do well God saved me because I I
[44:02] never did drink I I never did lie and
[44:05] steal that's the reason God saved me no
[44:09] that's what he needs to save us
[44:11] from thinking that we are
[44:20] something but but but brother Dale I
[44:22] just never was like them other people
[44:25] and maybe that's why God saved me well
[44:26] that's a self-righteous
[44:28] hypocrite I need to make it any stronger
[44:31] that's right the Bible says that our
[44:34] righteousness is what filthy rags in the
[44:38] sight of God so that would be really
[44:39] something wouldn't
[44:41] it no salvation is of the Lord Jonah 2:9
[44:46] says it's not our
[44:48] works
[44:50] right but that's the hardest thing to
[44:52] get people to realize you mean brother
[44:54] Dale you don't want me to be good no I
[44:56] don't want you to be good I want you to
[44:57] get born
[45:00] again if you get born again you couldn't
[45:04] be no greater right and you don't have
[45:06] to worry about it then
[45:09] right we don't have a book of rules to
[45:11] live by talking to a man other day come
[45:13] up of course he wanted some money but
[45:16] you know and buming and then he want a
[45:20] question said about this sabbath and
[45:23] things you know and what the day is and
[45:26] I said sir I said we worship on Sunday
[45:29] the first day of the week I said your
[45:30] original Sabbath is Saturday the seventh
[45:33] day you know coming out of the Old
[45:35] Testament bring it down but I said we
[45:37] worship not as a commandment of any day
[45:40] but we wor as Worship On the first day
[45:43] of the week in honor of the
[45:45] Resurrection course it's kind of odd I
[45:47] guess me talking like that to him but I
[45:50] did get an opportunity to speak a little
[45:51] bit cost me 20 bucks but like I told him
[45:54] that's blood money you spend it on the
[45:56] wrong thing it's up to you you know but
[45:58] I said you
[46:01] know I said we worship in honor of the
[46:05] Resurrection we as Christians are not
[46:08] under a set Book of
[46:12] Rules yeah like but but but you don't
[46:14] think we ought to be good no I think we
[46:16] ought to be born
[46:18] again if we're born again we're going to
[46:20] live the
[46:23] life right right if you're not born
[46:25] again you're going to have a book of
[46:27] rules you're going to keep trying to
[46:29] figure out what you can do to be
[46:33] saved and I know I'm hard to say it and
[46:36] I'm hard when I speak and I speak crazy
[46:40] but you know those the Bible says that
[46:41] have done more wrong are easier to be
[46:44] saved may I paraphrase it they're easier
[46:46] to be saved than those self-righteous
[46:48] guys am brother brand said one day about
[46:52] those Pharisees he said it was hard to
[46:54] get them to realize they were lost where
[46:57] he could die for their sins to save them
[47:00] what about a people that's taught all of
[47:01] their life that they are the people of
[47:03] God they are the children of God they
[47:06] are all of the things cuz that's what
[47:08] the Jews believed and then Jesus said
[47:10] you must be born
[47:12] again there stood Grace in front of them
[47:15] trying its best to explain what they
[47:17] could do if they wanted to be
[47:23] righteous but it's like Nicodemus he
[47:25] couldn't understand it
[47:27] do we understand
[47:29] that or do we just hear the words I say
[47:32] it I you know I said it now three times
[47:34] I don't want you to be good
[47:37] right well don't you think people ought
[47:39] to be good I come on how carnal can you
[47:42] get now if you're born again it'll take
[47:47] care of it that's right abely because
[47:50] Paul said it's not I that liveth but
[47:52] Christ that liveth in me and the life
[47:54] that I now live in the flesh I live by
[47:56] the faith the Son of God right all right
[47:59] see then it's not your goodness that
[48:01] saves
[48:05] you you just think about a group of
[48:07] people that Jesus was facing that he
[48:10] could not in no way now even him being
[48:12] God himself in human flesh he could not
[48:16] condemn those Pharisees because they
[48:17] were doing exactly what they were
[48:20] supposed to do and they were not doing
[48:23] what they were not supposed to do you
[48:24] know every how you say that they were
[48:27] right but he said your righteousness is
[48:30] no
[48:33] good what you need to do is get born
[48:37] again see church we are a product of his
[48:43] grace there's no Grace in trying to keep
[48:46] a book of
[48:48] rules the grace is in that let
[48:52] me die out to my thinking and accept
[48:56] Jesus Jesus
[48:58] Christ and let him
[49:01] live all right that's
[49:07] Grace as I said then look what it would
[49:10] start with and how many people wants to
[49:12] believe that God sent us a prophet right
[49:16] amen nobody wants to believe that
[49:19] yeah well if it started with a prophet
[49:22] what's the problem with it ending with
[49:24] one amen right now people don't have no
[49:27] trouble with it starting with one right
[49:29] oh they believe Moses they believe this
[49:31] they believe but what about ending
[49:34] up with a prophet to bring us the grace
[49:37] of God
[49:40] Amen see and to bring us to True
[49:44] understanding
[49:45] of
[49:48] Grace that it would not be
[49:52] disgrace
[49:54] amen but it would be the true revelation
[49:57] of God's grace extended unto
[50:01] us and let him provide the the uh
[50:05] preparation right he done it in the
[50:10] garden you don't see Adam and Eve that
[50:12] said while to go running around
[50:13] repenting and crying out before
[50:15] God no they was hiding in the bushes
[50:17] having
[50:19] church right it's back our fig leaves
[50:22] thought this covered
[50:24] up no
[50:27] it was God seeking after man Adam Where
[50:30] Art
[50:32] Thou well we look back there is
[50:36] Sovereign Grace will take
[50:40] over if we it just allow
[50:44] it and it'll become true
[50:50] Grace and true Grace will bring the word
[50:53] together
[50:57] right Grace will put the word together
[51:00] rules will never put it
[51:02] together quick as you get something
[51:04] figured out to make you good Devil's
[51:06] going to bring up something else you
[51:07] need to do
[51:10] right you think man I'm doing pretty
[51:13] good I went all this week and I ain't
[51:15] had no problems well you're just fixing
[51:18] to get
[51:19] it come that's that's where you going to
[51:21] dump it all over
[51:25] you but you see if Grace is unmerited
[51:28] favor then what could I do to be
[51:32] saved we were talking about it last
[51:33] night there in Romans where Paul said
[51:37] that even David in saying blessed is the
[51:40] man to whom God will not impute sin
[51:43] that's in the
[51:44] scripture but do you mean that he won't
[51:48] impute sin to well well we're just we're
[51:50] just so wonderful we're such a great a
[51:52] bunch of people till he just don't count
[51:55] it no that the righteous or
[51:58] self-righteous
[52:01] hypocrite he even got to the bases even
[52:03] though he had instituted the the
[52:06] sacrifice right in the garden he
[52:09] instituted the sacrifice and them for to
[52:11] do it and they were to offer the lamb
[52:14] and he
[52:15] said my nostrils is full of stink right
[52:19] from smelling your offerings that you've
[52:24] made and he was one that told him to do
[52:28] it but it become just a halfhazard
[52:32] thing you know just go get your lamb
[52:35] Throw It Up Walk on back do what you
[52:37] want to do and that's the way they were
[52:40] doing but he said a man with an honest
[52:43] and a contrite heart is what I Look
[52:47] to
[52:49] right what was the difference in David
[52:52] and the rest when David done enough to
[52:54] be killed right you agree
[52:57] right he took his best Buddy's wife away
[53:00] from him he he done all kind of things
[53:02] he was a murderer he was ever garbage
[53:04] can you could think of but God looked
[53:06] down and said he's a man after my own
[53:09] heart you mean God's a murderer and a
[53:12] warmonger adulterous no no not exactly
[53:16] now but David had a sincere
[53:21] heart and even as it says in the
[53:24] scriptures you know on his way from the
[53:25] bed with B Sheba and what he had done
[53:27] wrong he's crying out Lord restore unto
[53:31] me the joy of thy
[53:34] salvation cuz he knew he didn't have any
[53:36] he he proved that because what he just
[53:40] done but he was crying out for a
[53:43] deliverer that's what God looks at
[53:46] because there's the
[53:48] Grace Grace is not given for future
[53:52] events remember the the day we were
[53:53] talking about that amen you can't claim
[53:56] Grace for future
[53:59] events Grace is for what happened in the
[54:02] past there will be future events that
[54:05] will require Grace and be given right we
[54:08] we know that but don't be like the
[54:10] Catholic and pay for your penants before
[54:12] you ever do it you know you can go down
[54:15] there and pay them 50 bucks and go out
[54:16] and kill somebody well you're already
[54:18] forgiven before youve done
[54:20] it I'm not throwing off on
[54:23] them that's their beliefs
[54:26] huh you said well I didn't never know
[54:28] about that well you just think a little
[54:30] bit and it'll come
[54:31] out but understand what I'm getting at
[54:35] if Grace provided a
[54:39] savior then Jesus Christ was going to
[54:42] have to
[54:45] come and the only way that that Grace
[54:47] could be displayed to you and I the way
[54:51] that God wanted it would mean that he
[54:53] would have to come and die we are the
[54:55] only religion where it's required that
[54:58] our God dies you ever thought about that
[55:01] there's no other religion in the world
[55:03] that requires that your God
[55:06] died but see our God had to die up on
[55:08] the cross but my God can't die oh go
[55:14] ahead Jesus Christ was almighty God in
[55:17] human flesh you agree that's right and
[55:19] he died on the tree am no that was just
[55:21] a Son of God see that's where we're
[55:23] still in
[55:24] Catholicism amen and still believe
[55:26] believe in the
[55:28] old
[55:30] doctrines he's either was God in human
[55:32] flesh or he
[55:35] lied because that's what the Bible says
[55:37] Emmanuel which is god with us so then
[55:41] you're making the word a li that's why
[55:43] we believe in one true and living God
[55:45] not the the denominational doctrine of
[55:48] God in free persons Blessed Trinity
[55:50] there's no such thing in the word that's
[55:51] right there's no word Trinity in the
[55:53] Bible
[55:54] whatsoever it's not even there you can't
[55:57] put it there but see God's grace
[56:00] required that he had to die right
[56:04] amen the only way he could display that
[56:06] Grace to You and I right was to die in
[56:09] our
[56:11] place all right and why can't we believe
[56:14] it that way
[56:19] right you know why can't we believe it's
[56:21] all Grace instead of saying well you
[56:23] know I've been doing pretty good this
[56:24] week
[56:27] I ain't lied but three
[56:32] times that's just about as comical as
[56:35] you can get with it right
[56:38] right but follow me what I'm
[56:43] saying the children of Israel was not
[56:46] searching after a
[56:50] prophet no more than Adam and Eve was
[56:54] repenting to get an atonement
[56:59] right they didn't repent to get an
[57:01] atonement the atonement came you're
[57:06] regardless all right cuz that's
[57:09] unmerited favor see if you do anything
[57:11] to Merit anything you can't call it
[57:14] Grace it it's some works you do all
[57:18] right but see then the children of
[57:20] Israel down in
[57:22] Egypt sure they wanted out
[57:26] but they wanted
[57:28] some uh probably some Supernatural way
[57:32] of doing something or or they would have
[57:34] been glad to accept Moses if Moses would
[57:36] have come riding in on a white horse you
[57:38] know I come to take
[57:41] over but instead you see a guy with a
[57:46] stick
[57:50] right they would have been glad to
[57:52] accepted a a great
[57:54] charger and so would have they done the
[57:57] same thing in the days of the Lord
[58:00] Jesus had he come riding in as a great
[58:03] warrior to destroy every Romans and take
[58:07] over but that's not God's
[58:11] way but God's way was to send them a
[58:17] prophet now I've got to quote in here
[58:19] somewhere but you know what a prophet is
[58:21] really a sign you know what it's a sign
[58:24] of Deliverance all kind but you know
[58:27] that a prophet is a
[58:30] sign that God is going to
[58:34] speak amen is that a simple point I quot
[58:37] in here from the prophet he said a
[58:39] prophet is a sign that God is going to
[58:43] speak well see we put it all on the
[58:45] prophet speaking that's good his lips
[58:48] was used his mouth was used his vocal
[58:50] cords but who was doing the
[58:54] speaking amen
[59:02] right you see a prophet is not made to
[59:06] speak his own
[59:10] words that's why even who was it uh the
[59:13] one back there that went against it you
[59:15] know bam he said I can't say
[59:18] nothing but what God tells
[59:22] me
[59:24] right because you know what he was a
[59:26] prophet right
[59:29] amen and see he could only speak what
[59:31] God told him to
[59:35] say if that ain't Grace I don't know
[59:37] what in the world would be right you
[59:39] know to think
[59:41] about that a person could be so yielded
[59:44] to
[59:47] God as bad as David
[59:50] was and the garbage can that he was in
[59:52] his life and all the things but yet
[59:57] he was speaking the first
[1:00:00] person read the Psalms his brother was
[1:00:03] reading read the
[1:00:06] Psalms and David cries out they pierc my
[1:00:09] hands and my
[1:00:11] feet the dog wagged at me and
[1:00:14] the just like he was the one hanging on
[1:00:17] the
[1:00:20] cross because he was a prophet right
[1:00:23] amen a prophet being a sign of Grace
[1:00:28] to the bride of Christ now are we back
[1:00:30] where we at so you won't lose it but to
[1:00:33] the world he's a judgment
[1:00:36] sign because things are fixing to go
[1:00:38] wrong when a prophet shows up right amen
[1:00:42] and even the prophets a lot of times
[1:00:43] don't understand you
[1:00:46] remember
[1:00:48] Jonah he didn't understand he done went
[1:00:51] down and told him God's going to destroy
[1:00:53] all of them and they repented he still
[1:00:56] wanted God to destroy all of
[1:00:58] them now you can't put him over in the
[1:01:00] New Testament with
[1:01:02] that right right that was just a
[1:01:05] judgment or thoughts of a prophet
[1:01:09] amen God had to straighten him out amen
[1:01:13] about his
[1:01:16] thinking what about
[1:01:21] Grace what about the love of God
[1:01:24] Amen the gra greatest attribute that God
[1:01:28] could ever
[1:01:31] have is to love
[1:01:34] mankind
[1:01:36] amen and to pass his grace on to
[1:01:42] us and allow us to see the
[1:01:45] truth what if God had not sent a prophet
[1:01:47] in the last days
[1:01:50] amen where would we be right amen
[1:01:57] but yet he kept his
[1:02:01] word just as he promised the children of
[1:02:03] Israel a
[1:02:05] deliverer like I said they wanted all
[1:02:07] kind of other things but he sent a
[1:02:10] little old Prophet down there with a
[1:02:11] stick in his
[1:02:16] hand and he said I've come down to
[1:02:20] deliver he said Pharaoh let my people go
[1:02:26] Pharaoh said who do you think you are
[1:02:28] I'm Pharaoh I keep them he said okie
[1:02:31] dokie we see you
[1:02:36] later but you remember one thing that
[1:02:38] I've always tried to get you to see
[1:02:39] about Pharaoh he did have a little
[1:02:44] sense even though his daddy was the guy
[1:02:47] in charge when Moses was there the first
[1:02:52] time that guy still remembered
[1:02:57] and he was
[1:02:59] afraid what AM of pharaoh you go up and
[1:03:02] tell him let my people go we're going to
[1:03:03] get out of
[1:03:05] here and he said who do you think you
[1:03:07] are I'll just have you
[1:03:10] killed uh he was
[1:03:13] afraid God put that fear in that man's
[1:03:15] heart because that man feared Moses
[1:03:19] might take over Egypt again you remember
[1:03:23] Moses was in charge of the military
[1:03:26] right right all the mites all of the
[1:03:29] things he taught the Egyptians he he was
[1:03:32] a great man and he run to the
[1:03:36] Wilderness and when he come back that
[1:03:38] Pharaoh thought boy I better be you know
[1:03:40] I better play around with this guy a
[1:03:41] little bit cuz he might just cause an
[1:03:44] Insurrection you know a coupe to take
[1:03:47] over cuz everybody remembered
[1:03:50] him you know the old
[1:03:54] ones but you see
[1:03:56] see he knew who it was inside of him
[1:03:59] that was talking to Pharaoh so he said
[1:04:03] Pharaoh let my people
[1:04:07] go God sent me down here now let us get
[1:04:11] out of here we'll leave you
[1:04:15] alone cuz he was
[1:04:18] Grace the children of Israel was not
[1:04:21] going to leave out of the law right law
[1:04:24] came in the wilderness right
[1:04:29] amen there was no law in Egypt
[1:04:35] right it was
[1:04:38] Grace well why can't we believe that
[1:04:41] there's no law today there is a law yeah
[1:04:44] let me say it this way there is a law
[1:04:46] there a law of love
[1:04:50] right
[1:04:51] right I don't serve God because that I'm
[1:04:54] afraid that he'll destroy me and throw
[1:04:56] me into hell I deserve it amen if he
[1:04:59] does I deserve every bit of it I serve
[1:05:02] him because I love him because of what
[1:05:04] he's done for
[1:05:07] me he saved
[1:05:10] me we were talking about it so much the
[1:05:13] other day about it you know brother
[1:05:17] green and US
[1:05:18] speaking you see I'm 74 years old I was
[1:05:21] raised up when we when we were
[1:05:24] poor I was raised up in old houses where
[1:05:27] you look through the wall and see the
[1:05:28] neighbor coming look through the floor
[1:05:29] and see the chickens and look through
[1:05:31] the roof and see the
[1:05:36] stars telling Zach the other day the
[1:05:38] grandson about it for breakfast a lot of
[1:05:40] times we may have a little uh biscuit
[1:05:43] and gravy and if we got anything sweet a
[1:05:47] lot of times we put sugar on the
[1:05:50] gravy because we didn't have nothing
[1:05:53] else my point
[1:05:56] I was born and raised in the hard
[1:05:59] times all right I go to these countries
[1:06:03] or been you know to Jamaica uh
[1:06:06] Philippines and Brazil and I see those
[1:06:09] poor old people but when I went to
[1:06:11] Jamaica the first time my mind clicked
[1:06:13] back hey this is
[1:06:16] 1950 I remember when they used to tie
[1:06:18] the fenders on with hay bailing
[1:06:21] wire and the only way you got to crank
[1:06:24] the car was to put a thing in and jerk
[1:06:26] it and if you was lucky you didn't get
[1:06:28] your arm
[1:06:29] broke or push it off a
[1:06:32] hill because we didn't have anything
[1:06:35] else right you tied everything together
[1:06:39] and done it well see I could look at
[1:06:42] that and say
[1:06:44] 1950 then I could come out of it
[1:06:46] thinking well these poor
[1:06:49] people they're 50 years
[1:06:54] behind right
[1:06:56] right and
[1:06:58] see you can't go there
[1:07:02] well the problem is you go there you're
[1:07:04] going to give away everything you
[1:07:06] got right first time I went went first
[1:07:10] class which means three pieces of
[1:07:12] luggage full as you can get all doing
[1:07:15] you
[1:07:17] know when I came back I had three pieces
[1:07:19] of
[1:07:20] luggage two of them sticking in one of
[1:07:22] them and didn't have a thing
[1:07:26] gave away everything I
[1:07:29] had my wife said did you give them your
[1:07:31] underclothes I said sure
[1:07:33] did I hope it washed them but I give
[1:07:37] away everything I had why cuz you're
[1:07:38] looking at
[1:07:40] that and to think about America the
[1:07:43] grace of God that has been extended to
[1:07:45] us in the
[1:07:48] natural to worth what we have you know
[1:07:52] that's why I that I I can't uh I can't
[1:07:54] judge on nothing but listen do you
[1:07:58] understand what I'm getting at to one
[1:07:59] group of people a prophet is a
[1:08:05] judgment but to the other group of
[1:08:07] people it means God is going to
[1:08:11] speak amen that's why it says in the
[1:08:13] Bible in the days of the voice of the
[1:08:15] seventh angel it doesn't say in the day
[1:08:17] when the seventh angel starts
[1:08:19] talking it's the voice of God right you
[1:08:24] and I have heard
[1:08:25] God's
[1:08:27] word the correct understanding by grace
[1:08:31] and not
[1:08:34] disgrace we know what it is to be the
[1:08:38] children of
[1:08:39] God Amen and to believe his
[1:08:45] promises but how many people reads
[1:08:47] brother R's message as a message of
[1:08:51] Grace
[1:08:54] right why is the preachers all they want
[1:08:56] to do is preach on high and Gress and
[1:08:57] close
[1:09:01] and come
[1:09:03] on that's what most of them preach
[1:09:07] on like sister was talking about where
[1:09:10] they came from they wouldn't allowed to
[1:09:11] wear open toed shoes you know well all
[1:09:14] right that's their belief I ain't got
[1:09:15] nothing against that but it ain't what
[1:09:17] the prophet T but that's their belief
[1:09:20] you go and believe what you want
[1:09:23] to I'm not against you for what you
[1:09:25] believe that way I'm against it for the
[1:09:27] point of thinking that something like
[1:09:28] that would make us righteous right right
[1:09:32] amen like my wife said so you mean an
[1:09:35] ugly old bunch of naughty old
[1:09:39] toes you
[1:09:41] know but that's somebody's idea well all
[1:09:45] right but that's not the
[1:09:51] word and just like I I said I haven't
[1:09:54] done it yet I generally do it year
[1:09:57] hey Christmas trees you want to put up
[1:10:00] one in your home put it
[1:10:02] up if you don't want to put it up in
[1:10:04] your home don't put it up that's your
[1:10:08] business but don't condemn the other
[1:10:10] person for doing what you don't think is
[1:10:12] right amen cuz you show me where there's
[1:10:14] any righteousness and all of those
[1:10:17] things I don't do
[1:10:21] it well then you're going to wind up
[1:10:23] like most of the brothers has done you
[1:10:25] know what they've
[1:10:28] done brother Brandon put up a Christmas
[1:10:30] tree that's been
[1:10:32] proven but you know what a lot of them
[1:10:34] preach well brother brandham was in
[1:10:36] another
[1:10:37] age so he could put up one but we're in
[1:10:39] this age now that puts you prophet in
[1:10:41] the wrong age what do you got you done
[1:10:43] lost
[1:10:46] yourself well brother so and so said
[1:10:48] that well I don't give a
[1:10:50] hoot that's
[1:10:53] right who said what
[1:10:57] if you put your your messenger in
[1:10:58] another age then you better get over
[1:11:00] that age where he's at
[1:11:02] right or bring him over where you're at
[1:11:05] or something
[1:11:07] amen the grace of God if you're getting
[1:11:09] anything out of the message the grace of
[1:11:11] God is God's
[1:11:13] truth he said You shall know the truth
[1:11:16] that's right you shall know of the grace
[1:11:19] of God the truth of God and it'll set
[1:11:22] you free am not to know about it or a
[1:11:25] book of
[1:11:27] rules am but to be able to
[1:11:31] say I'm a product of God's grace am
[1:11:36] Grace has made me what I
[1:11:41] am then that way we don't look down on
[1:11:43] each
[1:11:46] other you
[1:11:50] know we we we are what we are by the
[1:11:54] grace of God amen right why can't we
[1:11:57] believe it that
[1:12:01] way and see then Grace would be that God
[1:12:04] would send us a prophet to bring us the
[1:12:07] correct understanding of the word of God
[1:12:10] right
[1:12:12] amen because of he's a true prophet of
[1:12:15] God he can't bring nothing but
[1:12:17] Grace come on you're not listening he's
[1:12:21] a judgment sign to the world
[1:12:25] right in a judgment signed to the
[1:12:27] bride you you get in the wrong way we're
[1:12:30] done judge that a long time ago in
[1:12:32] ourselves right got that
[1:12:36] right that's why everybody thinks all
[1:12:38] brother random come to do was preach hir
[1:12:40] and dress and clothes that was already
[1:12:41] in the Bible that's
[1:12:43] right come on I'm old enough to remember
[1:12:45] when women didn't cut their hair when
[1:12:49] women didn't wear pants and women didn't
[1:12:51] wear makeup and women didn't do that I'm
[1:12:53] old enough to remember that
[1:12:55] oh that was just old
[1:12:58] grandma well I'm old enough to remember
[1:13:00] when they used to go out in the backyard
[1:13:02] at the church and go down in the woods
[1:13:05] the women would get down on their hands
[1:13:06] and knees in the woods and praying for
[1:13:08] their children they wouldn't worried
[1:13:10] about snakes and bugs and
[1:13:16] things but you see I'm just
[1:13:19] a a product of Grace that's what I am
[1:13:22] amen now if it turned out to be disgrace
[1:13:24] then I would went on the wrong side
[1:13:26] right
[1:13:28] right well I don't agree with you on
[1:13:30] this well that's all
[1:13:32] right I'm not trying to judge you or
[1:13:35] rule you I'm trying to preach about the
[1:13:38] Bible of what it is for
[1:13:42] grace and now that that Grace has been
[1:13:45] extended to you and
[1:13:48] I that God would send us a
[1:13:51] message to find out what we're supposed
[1:13:54] to be right amen right
[1:14:01] right
[1:14:03] well see a nation a
[1:14:06] people they see a prophet
[1:14:12] coming them old
[1:14:14] Pharisees they didn't like them
[1:14:17] prophets
[1:14:20] right they didn't like him
[1:14:24] Prophets they want undo them prophets
[1:14:26] because they knew that that Prophet was
[1:14:28] coming to the nation was judgment
[1:14:32] yes right but you know the little widow
[1:14:35] woman that had a dead baby she was sure
[1:14:39] looking for a
[1:14:41] prophet
[1:14:44] right she wanted the
[1:14:49] grace what about you and I am see to one
[1:14:54] group of people back there Moses was a
[1:14:56] deliverer to the other he was a sign of
[1:14:59] judgment now which one is it to you and
[1:15:01] I
[1:15:05] right
[1:15:08] yeah the Messiah the prophet said the
[1:15:11] voice of the sign he said a prophet was
[1:15:14] a sign that the Messiah was ready to
[1:15:19] speak John the
[1:15:21] Baptist right
[1:15:25] judgment signed to the world and Israel
[1:15:28] as a
[1:15:31] nation but to the little remnant of the
[1:15:34] children of Israel they was looking for
[1:15:36] the Messiah to
[1:15:39] come he stood out there and he said I'm
[1:15:42] not
[1:15:44] him but said he's going to follow
[1:15:48] me and said you just get
[1:15:52] prepared see he was a sign of Grace
[1:15:56] amen you ever notice there in the Bible
[1:15:59] read it sometimes you might enjoy
[1:16:01] it you ever noticed that John had
[1:16:07] disciples
[1:16:09] right and they was John's
[1:16:12] disciples but then one day he said now
[1:16:15] don't follow me no
[1:16:18] more go follow
[1:16:20] him right pointed to the real true
[1:16:26] Prophet that was to
[1:16:29] be in
[1:16:36] Grace God brings his word to
[1:16:41] pass and why can't we believe that
[1:16:43] that's his
[1:16:46] grace you know that America is under
[1:16:49] judgment right amen why because the
[1:16:52] prophet came to this nation right amen
[1:16:54] it's
[1:16:55] judgment 56 he said I don't pray for
[1:16:58] this America anymore but yet you hear
[1:17:00] him over later saying we need to pray
[1:17:01] for president so and so we didn't do he
[1:17:03] wasn't saying it like we think he was
[1:17:05] saying
[1:17:07] it what was he
[1:17:10] saying we can pray for
[1:17:12] people but there's no need of praying
[1:17:14] for America to turn
[1:17:16] around it's not going to do
[1:17:19] it so as a nation is gone amen but we
[1:17:24] pray for people
[1:17:25] people so that's what I said he said I
[1:17:28] don't pray for this nation anymore then
[1:17:30] he turned around said let's pray for the
[1:17:32] president said you know that that man
[1:17:34] they ought not have killed him so let's
[1:17:36] pray for his family and let's pray for
[1:17:37] the one to take over and you
[1:17:44] know but think about
[1:17:50] it
[1:17:52] God gives you and I an opportunity
[1:17:57] to believe in grace are
[1:18:02] works I'll end with that
[1:18:05] thought we can make it which one we want
[1:18:11] it if you think it's a book of rules I'm
[1:18:14] not telling you not to keep
[1:18:17] them I'm not going to tell you not to
[1:18:19] keep a book of rules if that's what you
[1:18:23] believe but I'm not not going to tell
[1:18:25] you to go out and live like the devil
[1:18:26] that Grace May abound
[1:18:28] either
[1:18:30] right cuz that Paul said that's where
[1:18:32] they think we
[1:18:34] say to let us sin that Grace May abound
[1:18:37] he said God forbid that's right I guess
[1:18:39] he got a little upset that day maybe
[1:18:41] he's like me sometimes you get a little
[1:18:43] upset you know and say things
[1:18:47] hard but I hope you get it from a Heart
[1:18:49] of Love anyway the words from my mouth
[1:18:52] might be different but just remember
[1:18:53] what I'm trying to do
[1:18:55] right what
[1:18:58] now Grace is the oldest thing that there
[1:19:02] is in the
[1:19:06] world we read in the
[1:19:09] Bible word that it talks about the
[1:19:12] Morning Star saying together the sons of
[1:19:14] God shouted for
[1:19:18] joy that wasn't people up in heaven we
[1:19:21] don't believe that
[1:19:26] I'd rather believe it's God looking down
[1:19:28] now and seeing
[1:19:29] us because your Prophet did say
[1:19:33] that when they
[1:19:37] saw salvation
[1:19:40] coming and there wasn't people back
[1:19:44] there we don't believe in
[1:19:47] that I'd rather bring it down here now
[1:19:51] right and think about this is where the
[1:19:54] morning Stars ought to be singing and
[1:19:56] the Sons and Daughters of God ought to
[1:19:58] be shouting for Joy is over the true
[1:20:01] understanding of
[1:20:04] Grace to where we can look at it and say
[1:20:07] The Headstone comes shouting crying
[1:20:10] Grace Grace unto it like I said to start
[1:20:12] with he's speaking to us but we need to
[1:20:15] speak back to him we need to take back
[1:20:18] to him what he's bringing to
[1:20:21] us and then there won't be no legalistic
[1:20:23] works there won't be your thoughts it'll
[1:20:26] all be in his
[1:20:29] grace the Bible is full of the grace of
[1:20:31] God we've been through that
[1:20:35] right you know it was Grace to the
[1:20:37] children of Israel to bring them out of
[1:20:40] Egypt it was Grace to provide a lamb in
[1:20:43] the garden it was Grace
[1:20:46] to bring Salvation to
[1:20:51] us but now what are we going to do with
[1:20:54] it
[1:20:55] cuz remember as he says Grace Grace we
[1:20:58] must say Grace Grace
[1:21:00] amen if he says Grace Grace and we say
[1:21:02] grace and
[1:21:05] works now what have we
[1:21:07] done we haven't said what he
[1:21:09] said let's take back to him what he
[1:21:14] says and I hope you won't forget this
[1:21:16] point because we'll pick it up
[1:21:18] later he began by sending a
[1:21:22] prophet that could tell us
[1:21:25] his
[1:21:26] thoughts right amen he ends by sending
[1:21:30] us a prophet that can tell us his
[1:21:34] thoughts if that ain't Grace I don't
[1:21:36] know what it
[1:21:38] is amazing grace why would it say there
[1:21:42] Grace
[1:21:44] Grace unto
[1:21:46] it you
[1:21:50] know what do you believe about Grace
[1:21:54] well I think it's all right me just do
[1:21:56] what I want to do cuz God saved me
[1:21:58] anyway that's
[1:22:02] disgrace I want to live for God because
[1:22:05] he Liv for
[1:22:06] me that's
[1:22:08] Grace I want to stand in that Grace and
[1:22:11] say thank you Lord I can look back
[1:22:13] through the Bible and I can see his
[1:22:15] grace as it
[1:22:18] appears
[1:22:20] yeah look back there and see what
[1:22:23] happened
[1:22:26] cuz you can't explain the word of
[1:22:29] God I that God would forbid and tell you
[1:22:31] not to marry a woman of ill refute and
[1:22:37] yet you wind up with Rahab the Harlot
[1:22:41] coming into
[1:22:42] a position in the children of Israel
[1:22:46] that even David would come out of that
[1:22:51] lineage you can't explain that
[1:22:57] you might as well forget
[1:22:58] it you can prop up all you want to you
[1:23:01] can't explain
[1:23:04] that but you know what it wouldn't for
[1:23:09] everybody my last Point what prophet's a
[1:23:13] judgment sign but to the people he's a
[1:23:15] sign of Grace now which side are we on
[1:23:18] right why is the people always wanting
[1:23:20] to down everything and holler and scream
[1:23:22] about what's happening in America and
[1:23:24] what's happening around the world no
[1:23:26] tell me about the love of
[1:23:29] God it won't take me out of here to
[1:23:31] learn who's going to be
[1:23:33] president and I won't do
[1:23:38] it but to learn about the grace of
[1:23:40] almighty God Amen and what he's bestowed
[1:23:43] upon me to allow me to hear the word is
[1:23:47] that what the Bible
[1:23:48] say the Bible say it's a blessing to
[1:23:51] those that can
[1:23:52] what just hear
[1:23:55] yes what about it let alone to be able
[1:23:58] to believe it but just to hear
[1:24:00] it well because it's Grace let's stand
[1:24:03] come on
[1:24:08] musicians what do you think about
[1:24:11] Grace who was it Dwight Moody you
[1:24:15] remember and he run out in the street
[1:24:17] and grab the first person and said do
[1:24:18] you know Grace and they thought he's
[1:24:21] talking about a person you know Grace
[1:24:22] who he said the grace of God
[1:24:26] God Amen it's always been the
[1:24:31] grace but we better believe we're
[1:24:33] products of his grace
[1:24:35] amen and leave it at that right what we
[1:24:38] got
