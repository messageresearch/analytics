open your eyes and let our hearts and lives be set on him there's probably one for the other you know we got all these flus and bugs and coming goings you know but the Lord will take care of them all because he's the Healer amen and we believe that remember now the order of announcements remember this coming uh Saturday will be Bible study so we'll be here at six o'clock if you want to Fellowship together in Bible study it and then remember that remember Wade will be starting a series on the stature of a perfect man starting this coming Sunday morning and he will be covering the Sunday services for whatever time he needs to cover and you know then we'll fill in on the Wednesdays and try to help a little bit but you'll be doing that because he's going to go into a series on the Statue of a perfect man carrying it all the way through I believe it will be very enlightening unto you and help you to understand the scripture that our word that we read and we look at of you know add to your faith virtual knowledge Temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness Etc so just remember that and come and be with us and have a good time in the Lord you're ready to go into the word because what we do is we we tried years ago singing a long time and then letting the preacher preach a while and we found out everybody was already give out time the preacher got to the pulpit so we changed our way of doing we have the little song service 30 minutes then we get the preacher to the pulpit and he's only got three hours then to preach so he's the one that'll have to determine that part you know but then we will sing and have a good time fellowshipping together on into the Midnight Hour and be able to try to take communion right around the Midnight Hour but it has been here that we took communion at 1 30 because we didn't get caught up quick enough but that's all right there's nothing to do with it you know going into a new year I'm looking forward to a new year myself I

you over there in a Rapture is that new bird amen all right so then to everybody's looking to make predictions you know yeah but we thank God for his word don't we so let's sing Open the Eyes of My Heart as brother William bolivan comes and ministers the word of the Lord unto us if I mispronounce that name y'all change it when you cross back over the time zone into Alabama tell us where we're

good Christmas like usual ate too much and everything but that's typical holidays and uh we're glad to be here tonight we want to it's not possible to eat too much of this word amen this is where this is one good spot where it's good to be a glutton in the word amen there's nothing wrong with being a glutton of the word amen that's what we want to do God bless y'all again let's turn if you would just to get right in the word to Genesis chapter 2. start verse 18. and the Lord God said it is not good that man should be alone I will make and help me for him and out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field and every fowl of the air and brought them into Adam to see what he would call them and whatsoever Adam called every living creature that was the name thereof and Adam gave names to all cattle and to the fowl of the air and to every beast of the field but for Adam there was not found and helped meat for him and the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof and the rib which the Lord God had taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man and Adam said this is now a bone of my bones and Flesh of My Flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh and they were both naked the man and his wife and were not ashamed amen let's bear our heads to him in prayer the most gracious Heavenly Father Lord we are again so grateful to you Lord to be able to come into your house father God on this New Year's Eve and what a sacred thing Lord when people all over the world Lord are celebrating it the absolute wrong way Lord that your Grace has been allotted to us in our lives Lord to come and to be talking about you Lord and to be thinking about you to partake of that communion Lord and communion of your word and communion of your spirit and Truth father This Time Lord I just pray your blessings upon each everyone Lord I pray that open up our hearts give us what we have need of Father Lord I pray that you just closed my mouth to anything that I shouldn't say Lord and open it to what you'd have me say give us Hearts to receive ears to hear father and lips to speak just what you'd have us to say in Jesus name we love you we commit ourselves into your hands Lord and again want to mention the sick Lord I pray that you meet him meet with them Father the Lord and just restore their body we thank you and we love you and Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you you seated tonight this evening by the grace of God I like to speak on the subject spiritual conditions in the sight of God because we can go as humans along in a certain way or in a certain lifestyle or be in a certain condition and think we're all right but what's really important is how does God see us right are we really pleasing him and I like to put emphasis there in Genesis chapter 2 that they were both naked the man and his wife and we're not ashamed right we find that before the fall God had veiled Adam and Eve with a holy ghost Veil right to where they were veiled with his word wherein the natural they were completely naked but before God they were clothed right and in the right condition and then they're right because after he got through with the creation he rested it was perfect and it was complete so before the fall God had them fortified around his word right so then after the fall they were actually clothed with fig leaves but they were naked spiritually so when they were naked in the natural God's work was done it was perfected because they were clothed in his word by a holy ghost Veil right so then after the fall they were clothed literally but naked spiritually right and God seen right through them fig leaves so what we try and do and how because God has ordained for us just as he we now have to have posed naturally we must be clothed spiritually as well God requires clothing amen and we know that the natural types of spiritual right and the spiritual types are natural so he had them veiled and as soon as eve took a line was beguiled by the serpent she became naked and then when Eve out and then when she brought the fruit to Adam and he partook of it they were both naked before God let's look down in Genesis 3. The Familiar broken-hearted story of the Fall here yeah because you can imagine when a child in a natural does something wrong they will break your heart so God and that is just a natural so God as our heavenly father you can imagine when the news got to heaven about his Fallen children what they've done to his heart because Adam and Eve was a perfect Masterpiece of God and Satan came and he martyred that masterpiece now God was not surprised because God is not he's infinite and he knows all things but as a father it still broke his heart that he said everything imperfect there was not a single thing that Adam and Eve did not have right so Satan went to the weaker vessel and he got her to compromise on the word right and brother Ram teaches us that if God knew what that one broken word would cause all of the hurting and the crying babies and the death and the sorrow of these six thousand years but he could not bypass his own word God is subject to his own word so think of how powerful that is that God himself when he speaks a word cannot change it so when the fall happened God had to do exactly what he said the day they ate was the day they died right and not a single person has ever lived to be a thousand years a day since that time so in Genesis 3 now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made and he said unto the woman yea have God said You shall not eat of every tree of the garden and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the Trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God hath said ye shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it lest ye die and the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely die for God doth know that in the day eat thereof then your eye shall be open and he shall be his Gods knowing good and evil and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that was pleasant to the eyes and a treat to be desired to make one wise she took the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also unto her husband with her and he did eat in the eyes of both of them and the eyes of them both were open and they knew that they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons and we know as brother Ram teaches us that how in the world as a common theological belief would be that an apple made them realize they were naked right that's not possible right because if you think about it God does not change his word right because if eating app there's nothing wrong with eating an apple right most of us here love apples so if it was wrong to eat an apple then why isn't it wrong to eat an apple now right but an adultery caused a fall and it was wrong then and an adultery is wrong now because God's word doesn't change it wasn't wrong for them to eat an apple but for us it's okay it was adulterers wrong then and it's wrong now because it's the same word God does not change he is subject to his own word you know what I heard a brother one time make this comment and it's so good to meditate in but he said the highest form of God is his word and when you think about that and you think of all every Vision every dream every prophecy has to be compared to what the word and so you can so if God comes and he imparts his word to you that is an impartation of God himself right to you when you have a revelation that Jesus Christ died for you when you have revelation of the born-again expansion it is a personally a revelation personally revealed to you as an individual that is a part of God himself as the word comes forth and you receive it you are receiving part of God himself right and that's the highest form there is the highest form of God is his word and his Revelation to you there's nothing greater because God can speak to you through Visions dreams or Revelation right but the other the dreams and the Visions have got to be compared to the word but when he gives you a revelation and it runs through Genesis through Revelations you've got it so we find that Eve Adam and Eve and when they realize they were naked immediately so fig leaves and yet they were naked God could see right through their fig leaves in verse 8 and they heard the voice of the Lord God Walking In The Garden in the cool of the day and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the Trees of the garden and the Lord God called unto Adam and said unto him where art thou and he said I heard thy voice in the garden and I was naked and I was afraid because I was naked and I hid myself and he said who told thee that thou was naked hast thou eating of the tree which I come in as thou that thou shouldest not eat and the woman and the man said the woman whom thou gave us to me to be with me she gave me of the tree I did eat and the Lord God said unto woman what is this the thou has done and the woman said the serpent beguiled me and I did eat so he kept going on down so even though Adam and Eve sowed fig leaves for themselves they themselves are still ashamed right and I don't think that there's a person because we know that religion there's a difference between true Christianity and religion I don't my you know as personally I don't like being called religious because Satan is religious Satan is not a Christian because Christian is to be christ-like religious is to adhere to religious principles or or Creeds or rules bye Satan cannot be a Christian but he's very religious and so are his children and that can knock the socks off the carnal mind of the ways of thinking because people think they can join church and be all right but when they join church and that's where they stay Satan's guide them it's fig leaves religion is fig leaves they cover themselves and think they're covered they feel good about it but they're still naked and God can see it they are still naked whether they know it or they don't they're still naked Adam and Eve knew it they so figgly they try to cover but when God came they said we were naked we ran we had we were afraid because we knew we were naked and then God knew exactly what had happened brother random in the summer and Satan's Eden he said she was naked and eaten see the two kingdoms alike one is of sin and death and the other is life and righteousness in there she was veiled with the Holy Veil they were both naked they didn't know it they didn't know nothing about it because they were veiled with God's spirit and here this is after the fall they are veiled with lust and they look to one another see to see Adam could look at Eve and she didn't know she was naked but now with this lust fell she doesn't realize that she's naked right right but she does it under this lust Veil to make a man look at her it's the only thing she can do it for you so now she's under a lust fail and when she exposes herself it is only to make a man look right right so the Holy Ghost and a man will make him turn his head right because without what did Brother Graham say about a healthy red blood amount it is not possible Right it takes the Holy Ghost and our brother to make him turn his head but they do it because they're under the lust Bell right right they're not under innocence anymore because when they were under innocence God had it was the Holy Ghost Veil and that was just the lustful flesh pot you know and it never made sense to me hello early guy could just let his girlfriend just be exposed and walk around like it's a matter of Pride yeah you know it's like the poor guy don't realize that if she dressed in that way attracted you she's gonna attract everybody else but it it's like they can't even think right they think that I want to show off what I have it's like when a man or a woman leaves their spouse or someone else they think they've got it they're only going to leave you too right if they've done it once they're going to do it again because that's the world we're living in and if an outward expression of what's on the inside right what did Brotherhood say watch who you marry if you want to see what's inside a person watch what they marry exactly because that's what they're attracted to if a man marries a streetwalker that's what's in them if he marries a Christian lady that's what's in him because out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speak of and you watch what they do not what they say right how's it saying you know your life speaks so loud I can't hear what you say how we live our lives to this word is what really expresses how we if we believe this word just like you know Don't Preach a sermon live it we all preach sermons with our lives and God does not hate The Sinner he hates the sin right exactly he hates the unbelief because remember ours our walk is like a chain right over hell and one word is all it takes the chain is only strongest at his weakest link and you hear that all the time but think about it no matter how strong that chain is and how much weight if it's got one weak link the rest of the links don't mean a single thing and where you leave God and where you leave his word that is where Satan has a perfect right to enter in your life right because that is where Eve left the word where Eve left the word where she let down the word Satan walked right in and beguiled her and then cause her husband to do the same thing right and calls to fall in the sermon influence brother Branham says it's only for believers he said he that believeth all things are possible not him that don't believeth and one Speck of unbelief against the word of God and you'll stay out of the Kingdom of Heaven it took Eve out it caused all this trouble once just to pervert the word just a little bit you've got to say straight with it what it says one Speck of unbelief against the word of God and you'll stay out of the kingdom of heaven right and we as a people as a generation have the no excuse when God is coming he's manifested his word he's common there's not no reason for anyone to disbelieve one Speck of unbelief because Satan got to the woman the weaker vessel right and worked on her reasoning and worked on on her mental faculties we've got to stand on the word because if we don't stand on the word if we don't stand on all the word then we're not standing on nothing right because heaven and earth will pass away but my word shall never pass away one Speck when God Reveals His word to you when he speaks to you he expects us to walk right in that word because that is a trait that is a sign of a child of God is when they receive correction receiving correction is a sign of being a child what does the Bible say Bible language that if we can't receive correction we're as bastards right right illegitimate that's what the word says we've got to be able to receive correction correction is a good thing love is correction and why I'm against organized religion Adam was sure that if he covered his nakedness God couldn't see it you can't cover it God has to cover it exactly right see see God's program covers it not yours it's always been that way they fail to see Jesus in his Temple God manifested In the Flesh people try and clothe their own spiritual nakedness with good works and it's fig leaves you it takes God's program to cover us we cannot cover it ourselves no matter how good we are how much we donate to feed the poor what we do it takes God's program to cover us so what is his covering his covering in the beginning was his word and if he can't change and this is his covering now this is the word this is the blood this is Mercy this is everything and remember brother Graham said as God as long as it's in the letter people can doubt it sure come on but when it's revealed and manifested events about it it's sin what did Jesus say he said had I not come you had not had sinned but now that I've come you've hated both me and my father because he came to manifest what was written of him right manifestation of the word and when if it's manifested and the people see it before them then they walk away from it there's no more Mercy right to see it clearly and understand how many ministers did Brother Branham will approach the prophet and said we know we know you're right we know this is thus saith the Lord but we can't do it we're going to be kicked out they're going to lose their paycheck so they purposely backed away from the word when they knew what they were what they did it was a conscious thing someone can walk in ignorance and not understand that's one thing and then God can have mercy on them and it hit them that's what happens with people especially even raising the message they hear it their whole lives and they're brought up but then one time it's personal to them and that's what makes a difference because remember God doesn't have grandchildren he doesn't have message grandchildren either it's a personal experience a burning bush Sans experience because brother Ram said that when Satan then when he comes to you because he will he has he is and he will he says you take them back to that spot right you take them down to that top post well you met him personally not where you're saying it because brother Dale is saying it right right because the brothers are saying the minute because your mommy and daddy exactly right but when you meet him face to face that's something Satan can never take away from you up until then it's just intellectual you're believing unto but Satan cannot root that out once you've met him how can he you are there how can he say you weren't there when you were there right right how can he say you didn't meet Jesus when you met him it's not possible so it takes the blood of God to clothe our soul we can't do nothing to save ourselves not a single thing so the sad part is is when people are that way and they don't realize it right let's go to Revelations chapter three very familiar text verse 14. because how many know we're living in a lady of sin Church age now the bride we're living in that time frame but the bride is called out a lady to say Amen spiritually but Lady of SIA is around us and Lady osia is there to influence us if we're not careful exactly and remember lady osia is is lukewarm and how do you you know you can kill a frog by boiling it by just gradually turn up the water and they don't even know it right Lady of C is a lukewarm spirit that gradually takes people because remember backsliding don't even happen in an instant it's gradual slide it's not a back drop off your backslide right amen you slide okay verse 14 and unto the angel of the Church of the lady of sins right these things saith thee amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God I Know Thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would I weren't cold or hot so then because Thou Art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew the out of my mouth because thou sayest now he's not saying they said because thou sayest I am rich and increase with goods and have need of nothing and know us not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked I counsel thee to buy me gold trout in the fire that Godly character amen amen that thou mayest be rich and what white arraignment that thou mayest be clothed the latest in condition is to be miserable blind and naked so he said I'm counselor of thee to Bob me and white raiment that thou mayest be clothed and if thou shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thy eyes with I said that thou mayest see and as many as I love I rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent so he sees the condition of the church age and he's saying come by come unto me all ye that are heavy laden labor and are heavy laid and I will give you rest come unto me and I'll give you white arraignment that you're that your nakedness do not appear because if your neck and disappear you're naked before God and he requires clothing he requires a covering for sin right what did he do when he when he rebuked the Fig leaves he killed the lamb and he clothed them himself for a temporary foreshadowed atonement of clothes until the real clothing the Lord Jesus Christ will come right and he was crucified naked his shame he bore our shame so that we can be clothed he was naked in the sight of man that we may be clothed in the sight of God he took that upon us and upon himself for us rather in the presence of God and recognized he said just think if a man or a woman was on the street wretched blind poor miserable naked and you could tell them that they were naked and they would listen to you but what if they are naked and they don't believe it what a mental condition that is right right well now that's what kind of a spiritual condition it is people are spiritually blind wretched miserable naked before God Sinners trying to cover themselves behind fig leaves of some denomination and don't know it they're naked before God and remember God pronounced his judgment upon nakedness and then he clothed him a substitution until the real clothing will come naked before God right right because we come into the world as Sinners and naked before God just like we're born naked physically we're born naked spiritually right and can't do nothing to save ourselves so what does the first thing happen after the baby's born they cover it and it's always clothed for the most part right until they get older and then they don't know the Lord they take it back off yeah but God's intention is for it to stay on and then just as when a baby's born is closed when a baby is born in the Lord The born-again Experience they're clothed right they're clothed before God let's go to Judges chapter 16. remember this lady was sin's spirit is very sneaky is very gradual and that's something that we just need to pray the Lord will help us keep our guard on right because in this day where the you know the day of conveniences and all the the modern living and things that we have we've got to be careful we find here that Samson was a man of God as so long he God could only use what Samson would yield to him right he yielded his strength but not his heart God used his strength but couldn't use his heart right because he gave that to Delilah right let's go to verse 16. he fell in love with Delilah we all know the background and it came to pass Delilah was trying to find his secret right where his strength lied and he wouldn't tell her he kept leading her around in verse 16 and it came to pass when she pressed him daily with her words and urged him so that his soul was vexed and to death that he told her all his heart and said unto her there hath not come a razor upon my head for I have been a Nazarite unto God for my mother's room if I be shaving then my strength will go from me and I shall become weak and be like any other man and when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart she went and called the Lords of the Philistines saying come up at once this once for he had showed me all his heart then the Lords of the Philistines came up unto her and brought money in her hand and she made him sleep upon her knees and she called for a man and caused him to shave off the Seven Locks off his head and she began to afflict him and his strength went from him right so Delilah can be a type of the world a type of religion to where she put Samson to sleep on her knees she lulled him to sleep she sunk to him she played with his hair his locks and he fell asleep in the lap of Delilah he gave up her secret and the secret of the Bride is the revelation of the word and as soon as you compromise on that you've given Satan your secret right low to sleep right in the lap of Delilah Rock-a-bye Baby right and she said the Philistines be upon these Samson and he awoke out of his sleep and said I will go out as the other times before and shake myself and he wits not that the Lord was departed from him before when he was leading her around he would lie to her and tell her these things and when she would say the Philistines to be upon the Samson it's no problem I've got a good church I've got some people to pray through with me I'll be fine but one time he got low to sleep gradually by Lady Lucia he got put to sleep and when when the voice came behold the Philistines be upon these Samson or behold the bridegroom cometh Samson thought okay I'm gonna shake myself as before and I'm gonna go out I'm gonna go out to meet the bridegroom because I was raising a message church I'll go out to me to meet the bridegroom because I've been a good believer and they don't realize the spirit of the Lord departed from them and they're finding themselves in the tribulation period because there were low to sleep by Lady Lucia by that evil spirit of Lady osia the evil spirit of comfort the evil spirit of of everything going so easy because when trouble strikes that naturally makes us call on the Lord so in this age that we live in we've got to be really careful and not get lukewarm we've got to stay fervent hot on the word right and not be in the lap of Delilah and think that well that's fine because as soon as we we I really feel like the Lord's about to come I'm gonna get born again then I'm gonna get serious with the Lord then oh yeah it's going to be too late because remember the foolish virgins they know enough about the message to refuse to Mark is that right they know to refuse the mark so they have that head knowledge of the message but they don't have the revelation of the message they don't have the new birth in them to go out to meet him because brother Brown said at the bridegroom call is going to come right through this the message the bridegroom is called so when you hear the bridegroom call then you go out to meet them right but if someone is in the lap of Delilah they can't go out to meet them right because he's low to sleep and while he's low to sleep he gets his lock shaved off yeah everything he thought he had all the strength he thought he had taken right from him right and as soon as she said the fellow seems to be upon these Samson the coming of the Lord is upon that he said I'll I'll rise up I'll shake myself I'll be able to do it last minute look when we see the resurrected Saints it's going to be over is not going to be we see the resurrected Saints and we're going to repent so we can go with him at that time the mercy will be over the time of Deliverance is now now is the time that we must clothe ourselves with the word now is the time that we must put on our garments and if put on our garments is that it no we've got to keep him spotless are you washed in the blood of the Lamb we come to church we get our garments cleaned we get our garments washed in the bleach of God but the Philistines took him and put out his eyes that's what Lady of SIA does Lady of SIA will put out your eyes and you can't see what God is doing anymore because you're too blinded by the things of the world and but the Philistines took him and put out his eyes and brought him down to Gaza and bound him with Fetters of brass and he did grind in the prison house that's exactly what the devil would do to you put your eyes out later see ya take you to work in his grinding house because Samson exposes secrets to Delilah where has thou thou thou strength gone Samson because you know brother Ryan preached to Simon just once more Lord he typed Samson with lady osia right and that's later seeing condition where has thou strength gone Samson and he wits not that the Lord was departed from him he didn't realize until it was too late he found himself in that lady of sin condition in the lap of Delilah in this world is a nasty place this world is not my home amen you know brother Brandon said that this world looks like a urinal to God it's the nasty wiped out place but it's only for the bride of Christ it's only because of you right he sees a beautiful Jewel Ry we're going to get to it later where he says that you are like a lily among thorns you're his beloved you're his chosen lady so he's old enough until the last one comes in when the last one comes in it's already ripe for judgment so we know that the woman types the church both here is Delilah and all through the Bible a woman types the church and there are certain characteristics that the Bible gives that completely portray an entire age or an entire group of people when he says Harlot we know exactly what that means when he says a virgin we know exactly what that means he uses the characteristic of a virgin to portray a church and he uses the characteristic of our work to do the same thing they're both women remember both the Virgin and a are both women right what matters what differentiates the two is how loyal their loyalty to their husband right that is the only difference how true are they to the word of their husband how true are they to the wedding vows of the husband so we know that Israel types the church we know that we again know that the natural types of spiritual and we see that what Israel done the Gentiles went through the same thing they had their own version of the church ages right just like us and we know during the Dark Age their Dark Age Ahab and Jezebel got married just like the church in the state the same thing let's go to Ezekiel chapter 16. this is kind of a lengthy read but I want to just I'll just kind of try and read fast because I you can read the whole chapter sometime at home we'll read part of it there just keep in mind this is God talking to Israel in Ezekiel 16. verse 6. and when I passed by thee and saw the polluted and thy known blood I said unto thee well now what's in my blood live yea I said unto thee when I was sin thy blood lived I have caused thee to multiply as the butt of the field and now it's increased in waxing great and now it come to excellent ornaments they breast are fashioned and here is grown whereas thou what snake it and bare now when I passed by thee and looked upon thee and behold thy time was a time of love I spread my skirt over thee and covered thy nakedness he's telling Israel this he found her naked in her own blood and this is what he did for her yea I swear unto thee and entered into a covenant with thee saith the Lord God and thou becameth mine isn't that sweet then washed out thee with water yay I thoroughly washed away thy blood from thee and I anointed thee with oil I clothe thee also with embroidered work and shoddy with Badger skins and I girded Thee about with fine linen and I covered thee with silk I thee also with ornaments and I put bracelets upon my hands in a chain on my neck and I put a jewel on my forehead and earrings in my ears and what a beautiful crown upon and a beautiful crown upon my head thus that was thou decked with gold and silver and the arraignment was a fine linen and silk embroidered work thou just eat fine flour and honey and oil and that was exceeding beautiful and now just Prosper into a kingdom this is all what he done for her right and I renowned went forth among the Heathen for thy Beauty for it was perfect through my comeliness which I had put I had put upon thee saith the Lord God but now look what happens but thou ditch trust the thine own Beauty right and plate us to harlot uh oh before he closed her and she was beautiful put a a chain around her neck and bracelets and ornaments and embroidered work she was a thing of beauty but she started to trust in that beauty right not trust on the one who gave it to her right and plate is the Harlot of thine renowned a renowned importance that like fornications on everyone that passed by his it was innovate garments they'll just take and decades thy high places with diverse colors and played us to harlot thereupon the light things shall not come neither shall it be so thou has taken thy Fair jewels of my gold that of my silver which I have given thee and made us to thyself as images of man and just commit whoredom with them and took us the embroidered garments and covers them and thou had set mine oil on my instance before them my meat also which I gave thee fine flower and oil and honey wherewith I fed thee thou Hast even said it before them for a sweet Savor thus it was saith the Lord he gave all that for them and they to turn around with the gold he gives them he makes him images right he takes the Blessed they took the blessing of God and turned it to a curse a snare to their own selves God can bless you with things and you turn around and turn it to a curse to your own self whether it's Financial blessing whether it's good looks whatever it may be right because remember he said that's the greatest snare to a woman Satan perverts it takes it and turns it around so God can bless you with something he can bless you with a wonderful family and then you fall asleep in the life of Delilah and you ruin it right he blessed you he gave it to you sure and he turned around and you mess it up but there's Grace thank God for Amazing Grace because it was if it wasn't for his grace there'd be none of us here right most certainly he wouldn't be me here amen verse 16 of we got down to verse 20. moreover thou has taken thy sons and thy daughters whom thou has born unto me and that I sacrificed them unto them to be devoured in this or thy whoredoms is small is this of thy whoredoms a small matter Thou Art slain that thou has slain my children and delivered them to cause them to pass through the fire for them children sacrifices it should have been raised up in honor of Jehovah and they sacrificed them to a false god and in all that Abominations and I whoredoms thou Hast not remembered the days that I used when thou was naked and bare and was polluted in thy blood and it came to pass after all thy wickedness woe woe unto thee saith the Lord God the thou is also built into the inanimate place and has made thee in high place in every street and he goes down and he keeps bringing about that characteristic of an ill-fained woman right right because she was she cleaned her up and then she spoiled herself spoiled her skirts let's drop down to verse 30. how weak his thine heart saith the Lord God sing it thou doest all these things the work of an imperious woman and that thou buildest an enemy an intimate place in the head of every way and make us that high place in every street that thou hath hath not enhanced not been as in Harlot and that thou scorn us higher but as a wife that committeth adultery which taketh strangers instead of her husband they committed all this spiritual adultery against God they give gifts to all the but they but thou give us thy gifts to all thy lovers and hires them that they may come unto thee on every side for thy whoredom now this is flat language but God doesn't beat about the bush and he's laying it out and he's saying this is how you've treated me this is what I've done for you and this instead is how you treated me right in verse 35 wherefore o Harlot hear the word of the Lord thus saith the Lord God because thy filthiness was poured out and thy nakedness discovered through thy whoredoms with thy lovers and with all the idols of thy lovers with all the idols of thy Abominations and by the blood of thy children which thou just cast which thou didst give unto them behold therefore I will gather all thy lovers with whom thou has taken pleasure and all them that thou has loved with all them that thou has hated and I will get even gather them round about against thee and will discover thy nakedness unto them that they may see all thy nakedness right and I will judge thee as a woman that break wedlock and shed blood or judged and I will give thee blood and fury and jealousy right and I will also give unto thee I will also give thee into their hand and they shall throw down that intimate place and they break down by high places they shall strip thee also of thy clothes and shall take thy Fair jewels and leave thee naked and Bear so compare the beginning of that chapter to the end of the chapter right God raised him up and he gave them everything they have need of but it wasn't enough so then they became naked in the sight of God they were clothed and God said y'all are beautiful I gave you this I gave you a crown I gave you jewels and then she's naked and bare right right and when they rejected Jesus they had no more clothes for their sin right they were again naked in the sight of God right God requires clothing and a person now keep in mind a person can be clothed appropriately on the outside but still be naked before God on the inside they can play the part but be naked on the inside right but if a person is clothed on the inside it is impossible not to be closed on the outside man because and only God can see that right eventually it'll manifest in people's life but only God can see that right we must be clothed in the sight of God because if not we're right for judgment in job 29 14. job said I put on righteousness right right and it clothed me my judgment was as a robe and a diadem he said I put on righteousness and it clothed me remember when brother ran went to Africa and he preached all them heathens and he said that they were as naked as the day they came into the world what was the first thing they did when they received Christ they cover themselves up right and brother Branham said that the Holy Spirit brings a conscience of nakedness right it brings a conscience of nakedness you receive Christ on the inside and all else will be added unto you because the Holy Ghost is the inside teacher you know and if people are constantly trying to search the message to find out just how high their skirts can go what's the limit right well if a person has the Holy Ghost on the inside the Holy Ghost will sit to limit right I mean you don't see how close you can get to the edge you see how far away you can stay away from it right because there's things in life that we may face that we may not necessarily find a quote for because brother branham's true commission was to get abroad ready for the Rapture so he dealt with you know setting the church in order and and how they should dress and not cut their hair on things but there's things that you may come across that it really takes the Holy Ghost to set your boundaries it takes the inside teachers say well that's not quite right you know it's not it's not I probably really shouldn't go out you know if a girl wears a uh a skirt that is you know she can show you the quote brother random said as long as it covers a knee but if her heart is wrong then she's wrong you know it's it's the heart it's what's in the heart and that's where the Holy Ghost has got to lead us is it right or is it wrong you know the Holy Ghost is an inside teacher and that's what we trust him for he put us there he put that Holy Ghost there for an inside teacher Isaiah 61 10 says I will greatly rejoice in the Lord my soul shall be joyful in my God for he hath clothed me with the garments of Salvation he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness remember Lady of SIA he said come by Raymond of me that you're going to be clothed so that your nakedness do not appear right right it's the righteousness of God that covers you because we're in the righteousness our righteousness what does the Bible say is this filthy rags before our righteousness is as fig leaves his righteousness will cover us because it's not what we did it's what he did we can no more save ourselves and we can you know jump over the moon with our bootstraps or or do something like that we can't do it and you can't wait till you're good enough because that'll never happen and you know the ones that are safe Sanctified Holy Ghost still still aren't good enough still aren't good enough but it's his Mercy it's an ongoing Mercy it's ongoing clothing it's an ongoing washing just because you have a white Road doesn't mean it's never going to get dirty right but you come to church and you pray to get it washed but you need the Rope to begin with because if you don't have The Robe then you're always dirty man you're always naked before God right it's a shameful thing we wear clothes to cover our shame we put on the righteousness of God to cover our spiritual shame because sin is a shameful thing so he said for he hath clothed me with the garments of Salvation he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness he not I put on he covered me with the Robes of righteousness as a bridegroom decath himself with ornaments and as a bride adorneth herself with jewels because remember physical taking off clothes is a sign of demon possession Legion did it and what did he do he deeply says that after Jesus cast out the the and then his right mind right and remember them sons of shifa shivas in the book of Acts there when they try to do what Paul did without having the inspiration themselves mentally and when the demon jumped off of them off of the person they're trying to cast them out onto them the immediate side effects was tearing off their clothes and running around naked ran out naked but the sad part is when they don't know it because he's made a way he has made a way for us to be clothed the Judgment comes when he's made the way and then the way is rejected right that's where judgment comes let's go to Revelations 10 because this is a wonderful beautiful example of clothes talking about clothed in his righteousness Revelations 10 1 and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his feet was as it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of Fire so we have Jesus Christ coming down and he is clothed with the cloud because it's judgment time and the cloud all seven Messengers are represented in that cloud because what happens when people spurn Mercy judgment so the entire revelation of Jesus Christ he comes down clothed with that in Revelation 10. right so if you want to be in the Rapture you've got to clothe yourself with that cloud with the revelation of who he is right because remember he brings down judgment for rejecting the word so we have got to be clothed he came down clothed in a cloud right and all seven messages are represented right in that cloud so we are to take that because all seven abortions have been given to us amen so we are to take that message and clothe ourselves with it anything else is nakedness right anything other than clothing ourselves with the word of God is nakedness and that's exactly God can see right through it God you know we can fool people but you can never fool God can see right through what you're doing what you're thinking is it genuine are you doing it to show other people are you doing something on purpose in front of people to make them think something of you that's not right God can see that so when we do that we found naked before God help us to always be honest and genuine we are to be clothed in his righteousness because God gave us the clothing so on the day of judgment if we're found naked before him he's going to ask why why did we sit in a message Church hear the word preached hear the tapes preached and you're you're standing here before me naked when we're going to be asked to give a reason why right we have less excuse than anyone else Martin Luther did not have the Vindication that we have in this message is Jesus Christ it's not we'll bless God you know I can I've got I've got it all it's not about that it's about Jesus right right you know it's not I'm you know we're we're we're we're right and everyone else is wrong just because they're just because we say they are it's Jesus's right his word is right and everything else is going to go into judgment everything else is going to go to hell his word if you reject the word there's nothing left but judgment right if you reject the clothing that God provides there's nothing left but judgment right you know and there's no point in trying to look the part if you're not the part right you become the part and then you look the part because it happens from the inside out you know and if we have a need from him and we pull on him you know if we need more faith we don't try and put it on we wait until he adds it you know he gives it to us it's a he does it all right he does it all in Revelations 19. it says let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb excuse me for the marriage of the Lamb is calm and his wife hath made herself ready in the sermon marriage of the Lamb brother Graham said that she has everything she needs on earth now to get herself ready she has the material on earth now to get herself ready so the question is are we getting dressed in this right because half of a dress is a miniskirt and you're still naked right so half of the words you're still naked you know part of the word you're a pant leg or whatever you know I mean just figuratively speaking here or shorts or something you know we want to be clothed and this isn't just you know you know you come through the doors here comes the tape measure are you right no you got to go back put more no no that's not what it's about that's just a natural type in the spiritual because if you're right on the inside you want to be right on out if you're right on the inside you're going to want to be right on the outside and to her to this bride was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of the Saints right and he saith unto me right blessed are they which are called unto the mayor's supper of the lamb and they saith unto me these are the true sayings of God so to her it was granted the material is on earth now to get yourself ready there's nothing else coming it's been given because that is you know unfortunately can be kind of a big contention in the circles of the message and things because my opinion has been this if there's something else coming then people get relaxed and waiting for something to Quicken them into the rapture so imagine what a position that puts them in because remember you know shouldn't Elijah have already come and what did Jesus tell him he's already come and he didn't know it because brother am sent a church age book that the messenger only appears once in each age right he appears once and the material has been given to get ourselves ready in present stage of my Ministry brother random says I'm trusting in Him someday I don't know when for a crowning of my ministry right I've stayed just as true as I could be I don't know when what it'll be I don't know when it'll be and just when he's ready I'm done up here I hope he will Crown my Ministry of this of letting me take the clothes of the word and dress his bride in the clothes of the word and for his righteousness that's right I hope he will Crown me and let me say on the stand on that day say Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world he hopes that the crowning of his ministry will be to dress the bride in the word exactly and remember when he had the vision of the brides the denominations and the true bride those were naked remember all they have was a fig leaf and they were dancing to the tune of rock and roll so you go to the to different churches and they're dressed nice they're dressed fine but God in the vision show brother Brown they were naked because that's how he saw them right but he seen the bride clothes amen you know and I think it's interesting that the bride was clothed respective to where she lives to the country and the message is being translated in all the tongues they hear it you know the French hear it in their tongue and they get dressed in it and they look French it's the same word the Germans and all of them each respective as they're coming as the word was given to them in their tongue they received it and were dressed in it and they were walking in tune to the word clothed remember May the prophet sick to his stomach to see the the other ones of how they were dancing how vulgar and things that's right but the true bride are going to take the word that's been given and dress themselves in it because brother Brown dramatizes so beautifully you know the nakedness that happened in the Garden of Eden as it came on down and then he was that Lamb of God remember he says that you know he says what do I hear a Thump Thump Thump coming down the cobblestones I'm going to read it it's a little long but y'all please bear with me because nobody can dramatize it like the prophet can it's uh I will restore until you saith the Lord we'll start in verse 23 brother this was after the fall but God went out and got some skins he must have killed some sheep and innocent substitute throwed it in there and they wrapped these sheepskins around him and here they come out to face God now I can see them standing there and Adam that great manly shoulders the blood off them sheepskins running down his legs I can see Eve standing there in her beautiful form and all this Blood running over now Adam crying Eve a crying mixing with tears as it run down their bosoms like that Eve leaning over on his shoulder and God depart out of my presence he couldn't stand it it hurt God to do that but when his children went to walk away let's take a little drama here for a minute I can hear something going like this what is it it's the old bloody sheepskins beating against atoms big manly legs as he was walking out of the presence of God God couldn't stand it and all that great he turns he come down to four letters l-o-v-e God so loved he couldn't see his children go out in that kind of a condition separating from him he stopped and he said wait a minute I'll put enmity between your seed and the serpent seed promising a savior he said let's turn our camera now 4 000 years later there's a great carrying on in Jerusalem we're sitting in a building saying and we say what is all that noise about where did it come from look out somebody said well there's a Holy Roller out there they're going to crucify him this morning he's done nothing but just tear up the churches around here and everything so they're going to crucify him let's go out the window and look out there comes a man down the street over them cobblestones dragging an Old Rugged Cross he's got a garment on woe without seams as he starts to go golfing on her I began to look on his back and I see little red spots all over his coat I say what are those red spots I keep watching them as he goes the spots get bigger and bigger bigger now they all run into one great big bloody spot I hear something going what is it the second Adam the Redeemer going Yonder to Calvary bearing away the Lamb of God taking the sin of the world of beyond Earth to Calvary the most pathetic picture was ever pictured How could a sinner look in the face of that and remain a sinner is more than I can tell you he says the very same picture that was in the Garden of Eden and tight was fulfilled in direct manifestation 2000 years later God's substitution for us one was in type and then the negative became a positive he didn't do it he didn't do a thing to deserve that he didn't do a single thing to deserve what he got it right but he did it because he had you on his mind and what we've got to remember and believe with all our hearts is that if you as an individual would be the only one he had to do that for he would have done it that's how we have to believe him yeah he would have done it if I would have been the only one right he would have still done all that he didn't do it because we were cheaper wholesale you know and I pray they don't sound sacrilegious but he didn't do it because he had so many he done it if it you would have been the only one he still would have done everything it wouldn't have changed nothing he still would have suffered he still would have been beat to a pulp to his rib Shone through and you'd have been the only one on his mind amen that's what kind of God we serve when he does that and he pays that price and then it's rejected and it's like slapping him in the face Psalm 132 9 says let thy priests be clothed with righteousness and let thy Saints shout for Joy right you know brother Ram said that the priests the Levites is the type of the Bride he said because when there was sin in the camp they were the ones that Drew the swords and went and stood by Moses right and stood for the word drew the word and slew sin right and God says since you've done that from now on you're gonna be separated into me right right and that's what the bride does she separated a separated people unto him Ecclesiastes 9 8 says let thy garments be always White and let thy head lack no ointment you always want to be fresh fresh baptism of the Holy Ghost let your garments always be white and let your head lack no ointment because we want real Faith because real faith is what pleases God mental Faith does not please intellectual conceptions does not please God intellectual conception can please a man but not God and Only God knows what you really have because we see people playing the part all the time and then renounce the message because the word has got to go from here to here right brother the word when it's priest is received right to the womb of the Mind womb of the spirit and from here it's got to go down to the heart right and then out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaking God wants faith we know that faith is a revelation because intellectual faith is still an echiness real faith is clothing real faith is his righteousness because remember we all know the familiar text about Peter when Jesus asked Peter whom do man say that I was son of man I am and Peter knew he had a revelation he said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God let's go to Matthew chapter 16. and Saint John six remember when everyone deserted Jesus Peter stood he said where else can we go for thou alone has the word of eternal life Matthew 13 I'm sorry Matthew 16 verse 13. when Jesus came into the coast of caesarea Philippi he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that I the son of man I am and they said some say the Thou Art John the Baptist some Elijah Elijah and others Jeremiah are one of the prophets he saith unto them but whom say ye that I am right right and Simon Peter answered and said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God right so the question is put to us who do you say this message is right who do you say brother Branham introduced who do you say came down in Revelation 10. whom do you say came down over sunset Mountain what is what is the attraction on the mountain who do you say this is what shall you do with his Jesus called Christ it's all back in our laps again so Peter had a revelation of who Jesus Christ was and Jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou Simon barjona for Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven right and I say also unto thee that thou art Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it Jesus admitted that Peter had a revelation given to him by God and not flesh and blood right so now I want to actually just bring it up a little bit I want to pinch it a little bit because let's read a little further on down let's read in verse 21 or let's uh yeah verse 21 and from that time forth begin Jesus to show unto his disciples how he must go into Jerusalem and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes and be killed and be raised again the third day than Peter took him and began to rebuke him saying be AFR from the Lord this is not this shall not be unto thee and he turned and said unto Peter get thee behind me Satan for thou art thou art in offense unto me for thou savior is not the things that be of God but those that be of men right so Peter knew who Jesus Christ was and right there Satan used him to try and keep Jesus from going to fulfill the word right you say well how are you trying to bring it up we know you a person can have a revelation that God sent a message they can have a revelation and say brother Branham is a prophet and I know that he had thus saith the Lord but still not be saved still not have the Holy Ghost but they have a true revelation and believe it and respect it but not walk in it right right because Peter did that you remember what Jesus told Peter he said Simon Simon behold Satan hath desire to have you that he may sift you as wheat but I have prayed for thee that thy faith fell not and when thou art converted right strengthen thy Brethren when thou art converted remember Peter try to stop Jesus his entire mission what's the coming down on the cross that was a climax of his mission for us amen and be raised in things and Peter try to stop him from doing that now Jesus did not call Peter Satan it was Satan speaking through Peter carnal mind coming out there that we're all subject to so Peter remember then when they came to take Jesus to the Cross what did he do he pulled out a sword and cut this the high priest sermon here off why he was trying to defend Jesus in a carnal way Jesus was doing exactly what the word said he was supposed to do but Peter was still trying to defend him in the natural remember after the resurrection he went fishing there were rumors that he raised they seemed his Idol Tales to them Jesus had been telling them the whole time I must go sir at the hands of Sinners be raised and remember Peter they're not Jesus not once not twice but three times and he cursed by doing it but he had the revelation of who Jesus was but it takes more than that that's right he knew that God that Jesus was God in flesh but G but the Holy Ghost did not yet come yet to indwell him right because remember Jesus the Holy Ghost will point someone to the word sure if a person gets the Holy Ghost in the denominational Church they're not going to stay there he's gonna bring him right to the word you know I mean someone can get the Holy Ghost while belonging to a denomination right but it'll lead him right to the word of the day because where the carcass is the Eagles will be gathered together so the eagle is going to go find the carcass where is the freshest kill ER let's go to John 16. because remember why Jesus was breaking down the word to him they were puzzled constantly by his parables in 16 verse 16. a little while and he shall not and he shall not see me and again a little while and he shall see me because I go to the father then said some of his disciples among themselves what is this that he saith unto us a little while and he shall not see me and again a little while and he shall see me and because I go to the father they were confused they said therefore what is this that he saith a little while we cannot tell what he saith so Jesus breaks it down for him break sit down breaks it down look in verse 29 his disciples said unto him Lo now speak is thou plainly and speak is no proverb now we are sure that thou knowest all things that need us not that any man should ask thee by this we believe that thou came us forth from God Jesus answered do you now believe it they needed everything spelled out to him because remember the Holy Ghost is an inside teacher right that's right he recognized Peter recognized Jesus as the Messiah and could not even recognize the part of the word that that Jesus was fulfilling was going to be crucified he recognized that portion and Jesus blessed him for it but there's more because I want us to go now and compare Peter before he got the Holy Ghost to Peter after he got the Holy Ghost and see what that indwelling did to him let's go to Acts chapter 2. remember Jesus said after you're converted strengthen your brethren he had some clothes on now he had the righteousness of God now now he understood exactly a little while you see me and then he won't and then you will again yeah yeah because he's experienced it right amen in Acts 2 verse 14. this is after the day of Pentecost but Peter's standing up with the eleven lifted up his voice and said unto them he men of Judea and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem be this known unto you and hearken to my words for these are not drunken as ye supposed seeing it is but the third hour of the day but this is that right which was spoken by the prophet Joel he didn't have to go pray and ask the Lord tell me tell me what this means please break it down for me he said this is that this is what was already written coming to pass then Peter can say this day this scripture is fulfilled in your eyes in your ears because it brought him to the word that was being manifested right then Peter was brought to the fresh kill of the day which was the prophecy of Joel 2 28. right that's what Peter was brought to he said this is that and he quotes the prophet Joel and as and it shall come to pass in the last day saith God I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy in your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams and it's going on down let's go to verse 25. and he's going in the Old Testament and he's going to pull out exactly who Jesus was with the Holy Ghost out of the word for David speaketh concerning him I foresaw the lord always before my face for he is on my right hand that I should not be moved therefore did my heart Rejoice my tongue was glad moreover also my flesh shall Rest In Hope Glory because that would not leave my soul in Hell neither without suffer thine Holy One to see corruption so that's why Jesus couldn't stay in the grave longer than three days now it made sense to Peter if Peter if Peter had the Holy Ghost you know we know that wasn't possible because Jesus hadn't died yet right but he could see the word being made manifest so after the Holy Ghost he was able to say this is that he knew what he was talking about because God is the highest form of because the highest form of God is his word right right he said this is that in verse 27 because that would not leave my soul in Hell neither will thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption thou Hast made known to me the ways of life that shall make me full of joy with thy countenance men and Brethren let me freely speak unto you the patriarch David that he is both dead and buried in his sepulchers with us unto this day therefore being a prophet and knowing that God has sworn with an oath to him that the fruit of his loins according to the flesh he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne he's seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ that his soul was not left in Hell neither his flesh did see corruption so he was able to see that in the Old Testament and pull it out and preach it Stephen did the same thing you can go read Stephen's sermon and he starts all the way with Abraham and he brings Jesus all the way down on that horizontal rainbow with the Holy Ghost the disciples could not do that before the Holy Ghost right before the Holy Ghost it was just proverbs tell us what you mean but after the Holy Ghost this is that right this there's Malachi 4 this is that when he came this is what he did Revelation 10. this is it Revelations 10 7 1-7 so where are we at now Revelations 10 8 to 11. take this little book this day this scripture is fulfilled manifesting the word right going back to the word how many people you know we are very blessed people when they asked Peter you know men and Brethren what shall we do to be saved well Jesus said baptize the name of the father name of the father son or Holy Ghost but the inside teacher said that was the Lord Jesus Christ he had a revelation of who he was you know before the Holy Ghost he might have baptized in the name of Father Son and Holy Ghost is that right but after he knew that the father Son and Holy Ghost was the Lord Jesus Christ amen because he was that which was written right Peter was able to tell them how they could be saved and now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto Peter and to the rest of the Apostles being in Brethren what shall we do how shall we get clothed they recognized they were naked remember in Acts chapter 19 when Paul came to the to the upper coast of Ephesus and he said you don't ask him how they were baptized and he sent it to John's baptism he said that won't work anymore right all of a sudden they realized that they were naked so they want her to be closed so they came and got baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ because they wanted to be clothed then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and he shall receive the gifts of the Holy Ghost for the promises unto you and to your children it's them that are far off that's us and as many as the Lord Our God shall call Peter could preach then Peter had something to say then he could preach Jesus Christ out of the Old Testament just say Paul could exactly take the Old Testament scriptures and point them right to Jesus Christ remember when the blind man sat at the gate called beautiful and that he wanted some money wanted alms he said Silver and Gold Have I None right but such as I had this robe of righteousness I'll give unto you in the name of Jesus Christ rise up and walk and the man leaked to his feet and they couldn't deny it the Bible says because the man was there now here's another side effects of the Holy Ghost in Acts 4 13. you can read Peter's sermon in Acts 2 and 3 all through there and when they saw the boldness of Peter and John and foresee that they were unlearned and ignorant man they marveled and they took knowledge of them that they had been with Jesus they were with Jesus in the physical before the Holy Ghost but yet they weren't able to to do anything remember they were defeated on the epilepsy case they wouldn't have been defeated after right because they were able by the Holy Ghost to impart eternal life to impart the robe of righteousness now amen God himself and Jesus Christ is the only author of eternal life but God can put the believer in such a place where he can impart eternal life into others right now I'll read some quotes here because brother random said and I didn't and that's what that's why it's so good yeah that's why I can stand behind it and say Amen because you think how can a sinner saved by grace how can one human give life to the other remember a seed it takes a union to make a seed so if you speak the word to somebody and they don't have the seed within them you can't impart eternal life to that person because it takes a seed is a union it's not one-sided it takes a man and a woman to make a child to make a conception then it's a seed but in Saint John 14 12. Jesus said verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works then thee shall he do because I go into my father now remember Jesus said if I don't go up to the Father the Holy Ghost can't come the only way the Holy Ghost can come is if I go up to the father right and then he'll come and he'll lead you and guide you into all truth now brother Brandon I'm here I'm about to read it for you that the greater things that Jesus was talking about was the impartation of eternal life to others he said in that day on Calvary he said now notice the Greater Works was to have the power in the church not only to heal the Sick by prayer cast out Devils by prayer but to impart eternal life to believers the Holy Ghost was coming and given into the hands of the church to impart life he said oh that's what Calvary meant it took stoop degraded men and women and lifted them up into a place to be Sons and Daughters of God to heal the sick and to impart eternal life by giving the Holy Ghost to obedient believers who were once unbelievers be made Believers and impart spiritual eternal life how much greater is it to say how much greater is it to say to the sick woman laying here I can prayer Pray I can pray a prayer of faith and shall be healed that's a great thing that's what he was doing then but he said greater than this shall you do I'm going to give you power not only to raise them up for a while but to give him eternal life which will be Eternal forever he said poor blind wretched people how do you miss that don't you see what the greater thing is that's the greatest thing that could ever happen was to impart eternal life to people you say well how does a mortal impart eternal life to someone else by preaching the word by witnessing by telling them about Jesus that when they receive it they're receiving Jesus Christ when you receive the word you receive Jesus Christ exactly right so you impart eternal life telling others about it right if they can receive it remember there's got to be the seed you can witness to people and be ever so inspired and the fall because you can't Quicken a rock and and that sounds like you're looking down on but it's not you know God has people in his economy but you've got to call what you've got to call it what it is remember God is known by his characteristics you know if if it flies like a duck and quacks like a duck then it is a duck or if it's a hard rock it's a rock you can't have a rock and say this is flower it's a rock it's got the characteristics of a rock right so in order to impart eternal life there's got to be the ability to receive the word on the other side right the other person so when the word is preached or the word is witnessed or the word is red and it's quick unto you and you receive the word you receive in God himself but where does the where does the life go through the body exactly the channel of life is through the body amen amen remember Jesus told the disciples whatsoever you bind on Earth abide in heaven right right they were his authority on the Earth because remember the bride is also like the blood of Jesus on the earth as well as a form of Mercy because what happens is when the bride leaves the Earth Mercy's Done Right amen I have a quote here where Rotherham says that the Holy Ghost in US will return back to him right right and we're going to go with it my brother devil said it to be in the Rapture you've got to be born again and it's not you're not going to be surprised that you made it right you're not going to be surprised you're gonna know that is how we must believe that's right you know how we're taught if there's only one person who's gonna make it it's going to be me that's how we must believe it and I looked the word in part just to see what the dictionary had to say and it means to make known to tell to relate to disclose because God's ordained way to speak the word is through man right whether it's preaching whether it's witnessing it's not just ministers exactly you impart eternal life everyone has got something to do amen nobody can take your place in the body of Christ no matter how little you may think your job is or that all you're doing is going through life and raising crying babies you know that is God's purpose for you because what happens is it's kind of like a speck of oil in God's Great machine on a big clock or years if the oil if that drop of oil is not there rust it's gonna eventually happen and then what happens to us it starts spreading and eating away the whole whole the whole system right so we've got to keep our place new man the Greater Works to impart eternal life the same you know we we were naked that the the grace of God that he would clothe us right with his righteousness and give us the opportunity to impart life to others right because remember the prophet said that whenever you give and you give to the ministry and they go out there and when them Souls that are won he said you'll get the credit for it because he said you're the one that sends me exactly we're not all called to go overseas but we can support those that are amen amen we hold our position by sending them and it's God's Great machine regarding the one with the football you know we're not all trying to get the ball from one another if somebody's got the ball you block for him someone's going overseas you pray for him you support them you support the work and over there God will know right God will allot it back to you God will a lot brother Branham himself as a prophet would a lot the success of meetings for people's prayers people that would lay on their face and pray for a meeting he would allot his success in Sinners coming to Christ that person had a share in his success and all they did was pray for the service like a rock and God knew it so we all must keep our place you know you could do you know God can bless you miss our way we'll take you know God could bless you financially to be able to support the work and that's your position and a person that may not be able to support it financially can be the prayer Warrior and the one that supports it financially can't pray through for that like that individual can right so we all keep our position we all keep our place we are all positionally placed in the body of Christ for our own for God's Own purpose and his will you know in another spot in the revelation of Jesus Christ Brethren says it again the Greater Works because remember the healing is just temporal God raised Lazarus Lazarus from the dead and he still died again everyone that was healed in the prophets meetings have still gone on or will if he tarries but those that had have had eternal life imparted to them right can never perish so that's the greater because remember in that verse Jesus said the works that I do shall he do also heal in the sick casting out the Devils but that's all like temporal but the greater the impartation of eternal life they'll be there for eternity amen there's nothing greater than life he said but when Jesus came and sacrificed his life and the Holy Ghost returned they could impart eternal life to the people right that's the greater that's a greater he's the author of eternal life but we as his children are like the messengers of eternal life this is how it is here's here's the road get dressed get dressed get dressed brother Ram type that it's trying to put medication in and and what if the doctor was trying to put forced medication out of somebody's mouth and she spit it out through his fingers that's what's being done you preach the word swallowing the medicine is up to the individual right you show them this is how you get dressed this is how you wear the robe of his righteousness right if you if the person don't put it on you're not responsible right but you're responsible for telling them but not for making them wear it remember in in Luke 18 8 when Jesus said I tell you that he nevertheless he said when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the Earth that was the question because I believe that as the Lord tarries that the worldly get more worldly and the spiritual get more spiritual because as we're nearing as we're nearing the end of the end those that have been on board and have been trusting the Lord God is doing something wonderful with him right showing them things out of his word and giving them faith and and then the ones that have been in a mental conception walking away from it they're going worse and worse so in Luke 18 I want us to notice here a footnote of Schofield talking about will I find faith on the Earth Schofield says in his reference he said the reference is not to personal faith right but to belief in the whole body of revealed truth right well Jesus said when I come back to the Earth will I find belief right in the message of the hour so to speak right and the whole body of revealed truth well I find you know that song I'm going through I'll pay the price no matter what others do I'll take the way with the Lord's this past few I'm going through belief in the whole body of revealed truth remember he said one Speck of unbelief in your Mystic kingdom of God one Speck a speck is like dust like dust God help us we want to make sure that we believe the whole word of God the entire word of God because remember where you leave God that's right where Satan has access to your life through that open door that open Channel because that's where Eve opened the door and that's right where Satan entered program and perseverance he said I think each Christian ought to do that before you come out and confess the Holy Ghost confess that you have the baptism there ought to be such a personal contact with God until all the intellectuals in the world couldn't explain it from you you know you've been there you've had the witness you know it so he said that's a requirement and you know there I believe it was in the book of Acts where Stephen is talking about the children of Israel and how they came out of Egypt and Stephen says that as they came out how have they gotten to themselves A dathan and A quora but in their hearts they had turned back to Egypt they were with Moses but they're in their hearts they were back in Egypt and that's what people are doing today they're trying to get leaders for themselves to try and find false with the message and in their hearts they're back in Egypt they're back in in the world right and they're just looking this message is perfect this message is perfect you know well I can show you where Rotherham said g chapter three it doesn't matter this message is perfect because you say that by faith right there's no mistakes in the message because the message is Jesus Christ if this message was a man there'd be mistakes but this message is Jesus Christ you know people that may not understand may ask you know why do we listen to tapes why do you listen to a tape of a man that that you know passed away 50 years ago for you know 50 I'm going 50 years ago because the tapes the message is this manifested right it's like the gospels the Gospels is the works of Jesus Christ manifested right they've seen Jesus do it and they wrote it down so when you read the gospels you're reading what Jesus did how he went here and how he manifested the word so we listen to tapes because it's Jesus Christ and it doesn't get old if you hear a tape and you hear a man you've missed it right but if you hear tape and you hear Jesus Christ you've got it right because that is close laying on there when brother Dale and all these other brothers get up here and they preach the word to you they are imparting eternal life to you the question is can we receive it when we hear tape it's impartation of eternal life we read the word impartation of eternal life he's trying to get us dressed the question is are we stand still you can't dress somebody that's moving anybody that has kids knows that you know you can't dress them it's impossible you gotta chase them all over the place because remember if they would just if we just stand still then he can dress this you know be still and know that I'm gone if you have a problem and you know you're trying to wait on the Lord to do it just be still and know that he's gone because brother Ram said that Jesus keeps all of his appointments he's not late they thought he was late when Lazarus was dead for three days they thought he was late but he wasn't late because the father had already showed him he said in Christ The Mystery of God revealed the new birth is Christ is a revelation God has revealed to you this great mystery and that's a new birth you realize you're not a chicken you realize that he died for you you know he died for us but when he died for you it's a little different right now what are you going to do when you get all that group together where the Revelation is perfectly in harmony and God is expressing it through his word by the same actions the same things that he did making the word manifest oh if the church only knew its position it will one day then the Rapture will go when it knows what it is and that's what happens God is waiting on his church you know as the brothers always know and like the joke you know the brothers always wait on the sisters to get ready to get dressed to do their hair God is waiting on his wife to get ready to get dressed he's waiting on her to get dressed he's paid for the garments with his own blood Glory right right so now are we getting dressed Jude 1 3 says beloved when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered into the Saints earnestly contend right life is a struggle so to be alive you got to constantly struggle life is a struggle because God loves his church God loves his bride amen he's given her you know we read in Ezekiel 16 where God did all that stuff for her and he does the same thing for his bride he's given her all the materials she needs on Earth to get ready let's go to Song of Solomon 2. now the carnal mind the carnal approach The Song of Solomon will get you nowhere but the spiritual approach is beautiful now I just need to get over there Song of Solomon 2 as we go I want us to see because this is personal and this is how God wants it to be he said I am the rose of Sharon and the lily of valleys as the Lily among Thorns so is my love among the daughters now this is Christ making love to his church he's saying is there's a Lily that sticks out among Thorns imagine a lily among thorns that is how he said my love is among the daughters he's Colony his love you are his love as the apple tree among the Trees of the wood so is my beloved among the sons I sat down under now this is the bride talking as the apple tree among the Trees of the wood so is my beloved among the sons I sat down under his shadow with great delight and his fruit was sweet to my taste right the bride loves the word of Jesus Christ it's sweet to her taste he brought me to the banqueting house and His Banner Over Me was love His Banner was not judgment it was love glory and then we had the love like the lion the ox the vicesage of a man and the eagle all over the church in this end time all four beasts amen that well that's the banner over the church that's the Banner Over You Love stay me with flagons comfort me with apples for I am sick of love his hand is under my head and his right hand doth embrace me or charge I charge you Daughters of Jerusalem by the rose and by the hands of the field that ye stir not up nor awake my love till he please the voice of my beloved behold the cometh leaping upon the mountains skipping upon the Hills my beloved is like a row or a young heart behold he standeth behind our wall he looked forth at the windows showing himself through the lattice he's revealing himself to us he's showing himself to his love to his sweetheart my beloved spake and said unto me rise up my love my fair one and come away that's where we're living right here he's saying rise up my love come on let's go away for Lo the Winter's past the rain former letter Reign is over and gone the flowers sounds like spring doesn't it appear on the Earth the time of the singing of the birds is common the voice of the turtle it's like the turtle dove is heard in our land has he could to you through the revelation of the son of man the Fig Tree there's Israel puteth forth her green figs and the vines with the tender grape have a good smell Arise My Love My Fair one and come away the Fig Tree is putting forth her buds at that time it's time to arise come away my love let's go it's springtime oh my dove Thou Art in the clefs of The Rock isn't that so sweet in the secret places of the stairs let me see thy countenance stairs speak of access let me see that countenance let me hear thy voice for sweet is thy voice and my countenance is comely Jesus wants to hear you talk back to him he wants to hear you tell him how much you love him how much you appreciate them he said let me hear that voice for sweet is thy voice and my countenance is comely he loves how you look when you're dressed in his word right he loves it take us the foxes the little foxes that spoil the Vines for our Vines have tender grapes my beloved is mine and I am his amen he feedeth among the lilies until the day break and the Shadows flee away turn my beloved and be there like a row or a young heart upon the mountains of bether amen see how he talks to the church right he talks to the church in sweetness and in tenderness Glory he says come away my love the winners past the rains have come and gone later in 4 7 he says Thou Art all fair my love there's no spot envy you're Justified there's no spot in you Thou Art all fair my love there is no spot in thee in Psalm 17 8 keep me as the apple of the eye hide me under the shadow of thy wings this is how the Bible was meant to be read because the Bible is a love letter to the church it is a love letter to the church you say well I read about judgment about tribulation well that's not for the church that's not for the church that's for those that refuse to be dressed in the roads of his righteousness when we read of tribulation we say thank you Lord that you've saved me from that right but it's a love letter to the church and only the bride knows how to read the love letter of Jesus Christ only the Bride Can discern and little nuggets and see it in the word glory and when he leaves because remember at that day when we stand before him he only recognizes the blood of Jesus Christ nothing else so if we're not clothed it's not you're halfway clothed you're either clothed with his righteousness or you're not you're right either your clothes or your naked before him remember one Speck of unbelief keep any of us out of the kingdom of God right so my prayer is that the Lord will just help us all as a as Believers because we're all you know we're all scattered geographically in different areas but we can come together and fellowship around this word and and be encouraged and be strengthening because we have the same daddy so we can read the word and and a brother can come here from across the world not even speak our language right and you can he he can he can preach the word and impart eternal life now you know don't misunderstand me it's not a human giving eternal life to anybody he done it all right but you remember Peter said Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have he had it in them and he was able to impart it to him such as I have I give unto you right but then he didn't say in the name of Peter rise up and walk he said as I have I give unto you but in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ rise up and walk so we're not giving you nobody can save nobody else the only only God can say Glory but we can tell you hey we can point you and say he done it for you and you know what when when that predestinary seed it clicks then you know what you're right he did he died for me and that person comes in and gets Justified and Sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost and then God used you to bring that person to him right so you imparted you disclosed to him or her eternal life and you can also do that the way you live your life you get your assaulty and you attract people and you know there's ways to draw people so God help us to be salty God help us to to be more ready for his coming this year than than last year because remember once if I don't believe that if somebody I believe that only the bride is going to see the resurrected ones you know so it's not like if you see a resurrected one you're going in the Rapture you know people in the Old Testament didn't see Abraham and Sarah and then miss it you know with Jesus when he went he took he took those that have gone on but the point I'm trying to make is that in the resurrection that will be that final you see and you know it's time you know and I believe that we may even see people that we don't really might not really you know like when we get to heaven we're not there's gonna be no introductions you won't have to be introduced to Moses because you're going to know right who he is when you see him you know and I believe that when brother Rand was Pat was caught past the curtain of time I believe he's seen arthiopanies over there you know I it's I I just believe that personally you know because he's seen it as far as he can see my precious brother because remember if we dropped this Tabernacle if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we already have one waiting you know because he's seen millions and millions come my precious brother my precious brother remember he was still he didn't recognize him but they recognized him because he was still you know in his flesh he didn't recognize who was that woman he remembered that voice told him she was 90 years old right so that's what we're looking for is the resurrection so our job before then is to be clothed in his righteousness right Glory to be clothed in his righteousness and when we see him that'll just I believe that'll just Propel us give us that faith we need to quickness right because once that happens once God closes the door to the Gentiles there'll be no more Mercy there'll be no more getting dressed then he that's filthy will be filthy still and he that's righteous will be righteous still amen amen God bless you all tonight we appreciate y'all so much and uh you know it's a it's a privilege to really be able to stand here and praise you brothers and sisters and we love the Lord we believe the message we're just waiting on his coming right you know pray for me that I get dressed and I pray for you that you get dressed because true preaching true Ministry is when a person preaches to themselves too right you know when I if if a minister gets on someone else's toes if it's true Ministry he's getting on his own toes as well because we're all human we're all susceptible to mistakes he's only perfect one amen we love y'all tonight let's bow our heads in prayer degracious Heavenly Father Lord God in heaven we're so thankful to you Lord for your love and your mercy Lord

God Lord in this congregation that you just help us and forgive us of all of our sins and mistakes father Lord there's none holy but one father and all we can do is put our trust in the Holy One and

granted Lord we love you and we commit ourselves into your hands Lord and we give you all the praise honor and the glory in Jesus name we pray and ask all these things amen amen God bless y'all tonight let's give our brother a good hand s I believe it don't you man let's stand together and just change a little order of things and sing a little bit if anybody has a need come and just pray and believe and see God do it and then we're going into the singing and the rest of the service and thanks but just make sure you tell our brother how much you appreciate it because we do enjoy the message enjoyed him doing them I've always love to be able to stand up behind somebody and say well I enjoyed that that's right I have stood up behind people and I said I enjoyed that but it wouldn't all that I enjoyed but I really enjoyed it tonight I enjoyed it it was a good good thing good point good way of bringing it and I think we all agree Mr the word of the Lord is the major thing it's been said about Lula you know they said we all are just word word word word well what was that statement you made about the the highest form of God is his word I like that that's the way I believe it he said no no no you've got all but you've never seen any of those other things beyond the form of the word amen you may not ever see things beyond the form of the word remember no man has seen God at any time but the word revealed him I like that point okay I like that point let's just sing a song Anybody have a need the altar's openness will come and be prayed for whatever you would have and we'll just let God be the doing okay go ahead all right let's try number 80 in the uh amen amen amen amen there's a blessed time that's coming coming soon maybe evening morning or at noon United with

you don't see Christ in every verse now see he changes his thoughts you know see because you don't see Jesus the flesh we're looking like that said if it if you don't see Christ in every verse he said go back and read it again I said cause you missed it because you follow Christ all the way through the word right amen just make sure you tell our brother how much you appreciate the message you can be seated get ready for some of you to come and we'll have some singing and some worshiping and things and just remember pray for the sick ones Among Us no because none of us are immune to sicknesses but we don't glory in them we glory in the Healer you know last week there I was having a pretty rough battle about it and you know having a lot of troubles and tried to deer hunt and it's aching and all like that and finally my wife check my temperature Sunday afternoon after I got back home but his actress prayed for a hearing it was 102 and four tenths and she got worried but you know didn't bother me why because I knew who the Healer was well I went to the doctor fine thank God you know but Monday night it just broke I was sitting there sweating man I was ringing wet you know I didn't need a bath all I needed was a towel I had the water you know and took care of it see because that's where it all goes he's the Healer if we believe him he said well you still coughing well you're coughing too so all right we just all have a good time coughing and forget it because the next day is your day in the barrel that's a common saying in the South right it's next for you so next time you call we'll I'll pray about you so we just have you know the time in the Lord but who will be first to come and let's do we've got about an hour and 15 minutes and we can do some how some singing and everything but I'm not going to call nobody's name I'm not going to do that I'm going to just say all right if you want to sing come on if you don't don't come right later I will need the same we don't play all right so we have one to come got a bunch of them okay all righty look we got some brothers that's going to sing so come on brother the rest of you get ready because when they get through get up and come on we're going to start it off because it'll be all downhill from then on so yeah I want to give you a little background on this song because it's really special for this year being that uh brother George Canada and brother Mike Canada and brother Robert Tatum and brother Ernest moat we're riding back and forth to Jeffersonville and I don't know the whole story but they were singing the old song There's an eye watching you you know there's an eye watching you so they were singing those songs and then they got inspired to write their own verse well they they had from you know every how many hours it took them to get to Jeffersonville and back so they pinned this what we're going to sing for you but the special part of it is brother Ernest moat was one of the original pastors here at this church and he's passed on and brother Richard Marlow is his son-in-law and in another form Joe and Esther were that's the Tabernacle when they sang the song because it was their dad brother George Canada and brother Mike Canada and brother Robert Tatum and brother moat sang this song on The Sixth Seal uh when brother Brandon was preaching the seals they sang this song and it's if I were you I'd make a change so we're going to try to Bob and I was going to stand in for the other two and and the reason this is special is the last one of the group brother Mike Canada passed away just a few months ago so he's he's gone so the quartet's over there so we're going to sing it in this we're gonna sing it in the first three dimensions and they can be seeing it in the sixth Dimension my worst thing than in the first three they're probably going to do a lot better job but we're gonna try it anyway but it's called if I were you I'd make a change so they wrote These they wrote These verses and listen to them because a lot of us want brother William spoke on tonight so Lord bless your heart if I were you I'd make okay if I were you I'd make a change if I were you I could change baptized in Jesus a severe priest on the day of pentacle three thousand Souls they came and had breath and what must we do or repent and be baptized in his name if I were you I'd make a change if I were you right between if I were you I'd make a change baptized in Jesus name that's right Jesus be baptized if you have to be baptized again if I were you I'd make a change if I make a change if I were you I'd make a change and I'd be baptized in Jesus name spoke on this a minute ago Paul finding certain disciples they were Brethren that had just begun how then were you baptized they said we were baptized unto John but Paul told them if I were you I'd make a change thank you if I were you I change baptized in Jesus name that I'm watching you watching you you'll have trouble at the light there were no games you could change if I were you I'd make a change if I were you let me change if I were you you might make a change baptizing Jesus name to cross before ah I do yes that we've been baptized amen told you it's all downhill from now on amen praise the Lord enjoyed that that was good we'd have to practice but one time you know that was pretty tough if you want to Jim come up here and we'll get ours finished and then uh because I gotta run the sound system and but you know it really that last part there if you have to cross Chile Jordan is the park that brother uh Mike Canada was featured on so I missed brother Mike but he's in a better place no you know sure did you find them where's it at what okay we'll let James sing right there do it some seek for wealth down here some seek for fame I don't care if no one even knows my name I Feel Like a Stranger here soon I'll be gone nothing can hold me here I'm headed home well nothing can hold me I'm headed home Heavenly gates are near it won't be nothing can hold me here I'm headed home if I should die down here before that trumpet sounds if they lay my body in that cold cold ground don't need to eat for me don't sing me no sad songs nothing can't hold me here I'm headed home well nothing can hold me here I'm heading home if they lay my body in that cold cold ground nothing can hold me here I'm headed home nothing can hold me near I'm headed home thank you next who'll be next one of those jokes foreign this is a little course that we heard a couple of years ago and so every once in a while we sing it as a family in the van or wherever we travel and so it's just we're going to say in the course three times if you don't know we can just sing it here but if you know it just join in it's more just a praise and worship but just listen to the words cause it uh speaks of of the of the blood of Jesus Christ that covers us from our sin and knowing that is the token that we have in this age that we're walking in the newness of life in the life of Jesus Christ I'm done with the blood that's still a place rain rain today all right it is I'm walking in here is the place first graders thank you amen amen get them going young he'll be next come on a little dirty man looks pretty good for a man that had to pull him out of my leg probably been underwater at least 15. 20

okay ready to go that was sitting back there just thinking a little bit that's probably my problem but you know I wanted to share this first I want Sterling to hear this I got a call the other day that my sister was coming back to visit on January 5th and uh for you all that don't know this my mother and my sister came down when Sterling was born and they stayed with us 12 years until my mother passed but my mother came on oxygen not knowing anything about this work she was delivered for eight years or she passed then my dad came one time and he was of the world pretty much and quite a character and from Florida and he had all these Flaherty shirts on and he big old gold piece hanging around probably all he had right there awning that you wouldn't have thought so but he was sitting in service here one day and uh had sunglasses on and brother dick says I'm going to pray for my brother here that has a problem with his eyes but the funny thing about the whole story was I've been trying to get him to come he would come and visit every summer and he actually put a place I've got a big Campground in my house in the woods if you want to come Camp sometime with two motorhomes or whatever but he came and uh I tried to get him come he said I'm not I won't come he said because all they want to do is talk about tithing and I've been going here 10 12 years I guess and I said my pastor's never preached on tithing well you know what happens he comes in and he sits down and he the Lord just spoke to him so we go out in the car after service and he has his sunglasses on and he sat back here and he says Lane's over the seat put his glasses down he says for somebody it never talks about preaching on tithe and he sure knows what he's talking about so and I'm saying this dude one more thing because I've had my my sister my mother my father come through here and I'm praying for my brother pray for him for sure but I hope that he'll come sometime but mermaid's coming back and I don't know if you don't know this but she lost her leg from the knee down in the last year and a half and I believe we're in the day that the limbs could be restored I just I met that brother in Jeffersonville and we went up there that was had his arm restored and there's a lot of things that happen on that trip but I'm just saying this to say my God is real amen and uh I just thank for the opportunity I've been blessed this year with we have had as many as 15 in my Sunday school class teenage group and there's many many as one Paul and I just thank the Lord that we're for the Youth that's coming through and you pray for them but I say all this to encourage Sterling to be the example of a spirit we probably have 20 boards at our house maybe every other Friday night or so but they're at our house I'm just thankful for that amen that's a testimony itself but let's all sing a song and stand up because we've been sitting a little while because I just want to take a little bit

for us all right thank you you've heard the story of all in silence how they were found and thrown in today make it don't pray they didn't worry about me at night we came to change those prison doors and Paul and Silas stepped outside yes he'll Deliver Me In My Time of me like those Hebrew children from that fire him breed and he bit 5 000 missions fishes and bread and me walked on the water and he raised the dead well he stood by Daniel in the Lion's Den he saved oh Moses from Pharaoh's man Open the Eyes of the blind to sing I know that he'll deliver me now it was David by God delivered when before Goliath needed stay he took no armor he took no weapons just five stones and a string in his head as he went running to meet that Army he met that Philistine man that stood Mighty and tall he said I come in the name of the Lord I know that Mighty Man did fall yes he'll Deliver Me In My Time of me like those Hebrew children from that fire he freed and he bit five thousand with two fishes walked on the water and he raised her dead well he stood by Daniel in the Lion's Den he saved on hoses from Pharaoh's man Open the Eyes of the blind to sing Moses from Pharaoh's name Open the Eyes of the blindness now it was David my God delivered when before Goliath needed he said I come in the name of the Lord Moses from Pharaoh's name to sing I know that you'll deliver me yes he'll deliver me in my eyes Open the Eyes of the blind to see I know that you're delivered me foreign we got about one minute the Lord is good isn't he I'm looking forward to this year more than any time I've ever looked because brother heard Carol said there's one man said something to him one day he said you're looking forward to the coming of the Lord he said I think now he said he was 80 but he said at my age one way or the other he said because he's either coming or I'm going and he said at my age it don't make much difference so that's pretty good way of being about it didn't it just put it to the place of where you say well okay you know we're down here at the end of all things of this year and we always don't write no predictions no doings I look forward every day I like what Billy Graham said one time he said if he doesn't come this morning I want to wake up in the morning looking for him and I thought well if he could say that then I can say it surely you know I'm looking forward to his coming but I met at the same time experiencing that coming I believe the Rapture started the day you received the new birth is our brother talking about and you know that started on the day of Pentecost 2 000 years ago and everybody's been looking for a Rapture in the Rapture is in place inside of you because what's going to take you there is inside all right we just need to get the mechanics quickened into Dynamics to word that it can make the body work just as you put the gas in the tank does no good you put a spark see we're in that time now of all things and we really we appreciate it appreciate the Lord giving us this time to where we could serve him and you know what you say well why are we here that's the reason we're here it's because you said it why are we here right people say you know in the Bible remember we're talking about money he said they'll say well you know since the father they went to sleep and oh we've heard these things well you know what that was exactly the scriptures that were showing where they were living when you question God remember you're the problem so then why not look for him every day and don't worry about it and say thank you and just be happy and rejoice and say thank you Lord for what I have heard when I've been allowed to be a part of and to Feast upon your word and you could teach us something what a wonderful thing as we enter into this time of the new year we always try to take the communion while they're out there Holland screaming and shouting and praising their God we just take a little quiet time and take the communion and just Fellowship together because like our brother said see communion is to Fellowship it takes two people to commune you know you you can't do by yourself so the communion then is to and brother Brown says that we we do too much now listen the way he says it 'll say one time you don't pray enough next time you say you pray too much when I listen what he's saying he says because a lot of times we do all the talking and he says prior mine were to be that we shut up listen to him let him do the talking save us a lot more trouble than we think you know doing it but we appreciate everything it's been said and done appreciate the message our brothers brought to us today we appreciate all of the singing the things and and I always just appreciate God for being who he is he's still the Healer he's still the deliverer and I believe we'll see a whole lot more this year of things because I always look at that I'm never satisfied one day it you know we take one day at a time but I'm never satisfied to just be well you know okay we're in the message Glory Hallelujah no I don't believe that's what turned the world up in the days of Martin Luther turned it upside down when that man saw the judge she'll live by faith Catholic Church didn't get upset at him about saying that he was just one man but when the people begin to say it right they got concerned the world's not concerned about us passing out dates and books and tracks talking about William Branham as a prophet and thing but when the people begin to live the message the man brought then the world get upset the prophet said when a move becomes among the bride them denominations will swing together oh we're looking out there for all to start well all right let's get something not manufactured let's just get it to going did he say it this way he said when the bride realizes who she is she'll be an invincible Army well I just don't see that well that's the people that's that's the cause that's the trouble is the people not seeing it so we could at least start saying it right just let's think about the scriptures because now remember what about the great men that were there with the Lord Jesus all around him and everything they were there when he instituted the communion in the upper room but not one of them was ever asked to explain it neither one of them ever put into words oh yeah you have this talking about you got the writings Matthew Martin Luke and John but now get on over and John later he's writing he didn't mention the communion what about the great Apostle Paul who was born out of new season but yet he was asked to explain the communion and he wasn't even there when it was instituted but he could go back in that Old Testament and pull that word out and bring it down you know and we found out way done a marvelous job one time bringing it out so you go back there and they would leave a table they'd leave a place they'd leave things and they had to bread to communion in that thing they didn't know what it was all about they didn't understand what they were doing and Jesus just picks it up and said here let me explain this this is what you should have been doing all alone it was there in the word let's read the scripture pray go into the communion and thank the Lord for the word for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take you this is my body which is broken for you this due in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had stopped saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this due years after you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you Deuce you the Lord's death till he come or for whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and sold any meat of that bread and drink of that cup he didn't eat it and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for we would judge ourselves we should not be judged I love this part but when we are judged what does he do rotation to the Lord why that we should not be condemned with the world or for my brethren when you come together to eat Terry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not under condemnation and the rest will I said in order when I come let's just take a few moments and just have a solid prayer and praying one for the others that the Lord would be with us this year and guide us and take care of us and pray for you Pastor and pray for the people and all that we may all be one together in him father we thank you for this day and we thank you for the hour that we've had the times we've had tonight Lord it ended a year and we start a new thank you for the word that we ended up on and knowing that what we ended up on is what we start on because it becomes former and latter in it we just walked right out onto the word of the day and the time because we have that word promised unto us throughout the message we need to recognize our day and it's time forgive our sins and lead us by thine understanding that we may walk in the light of your loving grace teach us to wait upon you Lord in Jesus name amen the Bible said he took bread and blessed it Lord Jesus we thank you for this bread has been made for this purpose tonight and for this purpose only was it designed if we might be able to break it and think about you we know it's not the bloody we know that it represents your body you think too far we know it's not the word that is represents the word then if we take it is it in representation but a representation in you is greater than a reality to any of us we love you and we thank you we ask you to sanctify this bread and the partakers in Jesus name you know we make the bread certainly for certain ways for blue wings we do all of the things the best we can do according to what we believe the word says and to do with it's not designed to be a tomorrow or the next day we burned up what's left tonight would be burned we're in another day but we're not looking for a holdover we're looking for a reality knowing that crashed is our life and we're just relaxing in him before that he can be whatever is needed for us this day we thank the Lord for the examples that we used to be and we used to take them you know we've done the best we could do but we'd make little Wafers and do kind of things and try to take grape juice and do all kind of things to but one note we found out what the truth is now we believe it father we thank you for this wine this went through the process here and as it's going through that process of aging and it's come to the basis to represent your blood which was shed for each one of us we know it's not the blood but we know it represents it but we know what this will be and we'll eat a little piece of bread and we'll drink a little sip of wine and tomorrow this will create blood cells in our body that we may physically live thereby we just if we could realize that then Lord how much more do we realize the spiritual condition of what's taking place sanctify the wine under partakers come morning I want by the river I'll rest knee the evergreen tree I'll carry in my cross through the midnight come morning there's glory for me sometimes I'm despised and rejected and I question oh Father how long then I take one more at Mount Calvary and it gives me the strength to you see why do you sing while you're taking the communion well they used to sing when they entered the temple they used to sing when they'd go through this ritual or that one of the things they were always singing I wrote in my Bible where the the three great songs that
