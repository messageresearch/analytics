[19:25] praise the lord jesus we appreciate the
[19:26] lord and we thank god for
[19:28] giving us protection while we were out
[19:30] this past weekend for the dutch and his
[19:32] the church and his greetings
[19:34] and uh we certainly had a good time so
[19:37] as i told some other people
[19:39] you know
[19:40] the lord said what he needed to say
[19:43] so i believe i believe i believe we the
[19:46] the church enjoyed
[19:49] the word of god and we had some good
[19:50] fellowship with them
[19:52] um didn't know but but you just pray for
[19:55] brother tatum
[19:57] brother tatum uh his
[19:59] apparently he fell the following day
[20:01] which was monday and fell right on his
[20:03] face
[20:04] split open his head and stuff and like
[20:06] he's got stitches all the way down so he
[20:09] broke his neck and
[20:11] so you pray for him he's about 70
[20:13] something years old
[20:15] so sunday he was fine no problems he was
[20:18] there at church monday he's having
[20:20] stitches so i had no idea until brother
[20:23] wade told me just now so
[20:25] so you remember brother tatum in your
[20:26] prayers
[20:28] amen and also continue to remember his
[20:30] wife in prayer um
[20:34] she uh you know how she's been battling
[20:36] with with her mind and and they've been
[20:38] having issues with the dementia
[20:41] and uh so but it's just when you talk
[20:43] with her you know i came up to her and
[20:46] it was talking to her and
[20:48] and she said well just give me a hug i
[20:50] haven't hugged you in a long time
[20:53] i had never hugged her before
[20:55] but that's all right
[20:59] and so
[21:00] i have no qualms of hugging our elderly
[21:03] sisters you know i just see them as
[21:05] mothers
[21:06] but it was just interesting because you
[21:08] know she
[21:09] i don't know i've only seen her maybe
[21:11] like three or four times in my lifetime
[21:14] so she was acting like i just known her
[21:16] forever
[21:17] you remember hearing your prayers
[21:19] remember them especially now that
[21:20] brother tatum he fell so the lord would
[21:22] give him a
[21:24] a quick recovery amen
[21:27] amen well let's just go to the lord in
[21:29] prayer we thank that god for
[21:31] uh bringing brother wade back and uh my
[21:34] goodness we certainly enjoyed listening
[21:36] in to the sermons is on sunday man i i
[21:39] believe the lord deserves another clap
[21:41] of praise these brothers
[21:42] did a wonderful job
[21:46] and
[21:47] certainly
[21:49] certainly i would i would hope brother
[21:51] dale would think he's proud
[21:52] [Laughter]
[21:54] amen
[21:56] and they did an excellent job from
[21:58] sunday school sermon uh all the way to
[22:00] the afternoon service
[22:02] it was exactly what the lord needed to
[22:04] say
[22:05] amen not to mention brother brother
[22:07] aaron man he was as sharp as a
[22:10] yeah sharp as a needle
[22:15] yeah so
[22:17] you need to see it more often though
[22:21] amen you look good look good
[22:24] well we just thank the lord sister
[22:26] alicia don't feel bad
[22:27] that was an excellent song
[22:29] and
[22:30] sometimes sometimes you know it may not
[22:32] come out right but the intention god
[22:34] sees the heart
[22:35] amen so that's that's what's most
[22:38] important
[22:39] amen
[22:40] all right well let's go to the lord and
[22:42] uh let's just read his word this this
[22:45] evening and
[22:47] let's turn to philippians chapter four
[22:50] philippians chapter four
[22:54] i want to start i guess i want to start
[22:56] on a little series
[22:58] about think on these things
[23:01] and uh this first part i want to call
[23:03] it's time to ditch your stinking
[23:04] thinking
[23:06] amen so i don't know how long how long
[23:08] this might take us and uh of course it's
[23:11] probably gonna take us a long time since
[23:13] you know we don't constantly preach but
[23:16] um
[23:17] it'll be more of a series
[23:19] um
[23:20] the lord's just been dealing with me on
[23:21] this scripture ever since really ever
[23:24] since colbert hit
[23:26] and it's just been a battle for me
[23:28] personally
[23:29] personally because
[23:31] i'm the type of person that you know i
[23:34] see things around the world and i look
[23:36] at them
[23:37] very different than most people look at
[23:39] things
[23:40] and when you sit there and look at
[23:41] things
[23:42] constantly and and ponder over those
[23:45] things and
[23:46] maybe what's going on behind the scenes
[23:48] and that your family might be in trouble
[23:50] and that they're out there to kill you
[23:52] and all these things
[23:54] it really drains you
[23:56] it really drains your spirit it really
[23:59] drains your your emotions it really
[24:01] drains your
[24:03] you're even you're you're you're even
[24:05] your trust in the lord
[24:07] but but when the lord
[24:09] when i when i came on this scripture
[24:11] philippians chapter 4
[24:12] and
[24:13] i visited back in in in
[24:16] 2020 came back and uh
[24:19] it really gave me strength during that
[24:21] time
[24:22] and then i came back uh and revisited it
[24:25] again here this this past year and
[24:27] early early this year
[24:29] it's really put into a lot into
[24:32] perspective
[24:33] of what we as christians we really need
[24:36] to do
[24:37] and what really really really matters in
[24:39] life
[24:40] it's not all about what's going on but
[24:43] around the world the world's going to do
[24:45] what they're going to do
[24:47] as i've always said
[24:49] the lord is going to allow anything and
[24:51] everything to happen in order for his
[24:53] word to be fulfilled
[24:55] and for his bride to get ready
[24:58] you see there might be agendas behind
[24:59] the scene there might be conspiracies
[25:02] and things like that but we don't know
[25:03] all the details
[25:05] but only god knows
[25:07] but all that we need to worry and be
[25:09] concerned about is what god is doing
[25:12] through his word and that god is
[25:15] fulfilling his word
[25:17] and so the and so
[25:19] sometimes we just need to just lay aside
[25:22] our own thinking
[25:23] because let me tell you a lot of not not
[25:25] just not just the news and not just the
[25:28] the media but but even other things that
[25:32] might might take a hold of our mind
[25:34] it can really wear you out
[25:37] and completely take you away from you
[25:40] being concentrated on god
[25:43] and that's all that matters really in
[25:44] this life
[25:46] what what is it what what did uh solomon
[25:48] say i believe he said he said
[25:51] the whole thing ends up uh
[25:54] and just one this one thing serve the
[25:56] lord and keep his commandments
[25:59] and that's all really life is what it's
[26:00] about
[26:02] well the only thing that matters is him
[26:04] and so we just want to we want to take a
[26:06] little series on that and basing it upon
[26:08] this scripture and then another one
[26:09] we're going to read so let's read here
[26:11] in philippians chapter 4.
[26:14] let's just go to the lord in prayer
[26:17] our heavenly father
[26:18] we thank you lord jesus once again for
[26:20] the opportunity to serve you lord we
[26:22] appreciate heavenly father the
[26:25] blessings lord that you give us through
[26:26] your word we know heavenly father that
[26:28] you sent your word father and you sent
[26:30] to heal us lord and not just heavenly
[26:32] father physically but also mentally lord
[26:35] god
[26:35] also lord spiritually lord jesus there's
[26:38] healing throughout all this word father
[26:41] and i pray lord god that you would just
[26:43] help us tonight father as we endeavor to
[26:45] look into your word if whatever father
[26:47] any person here lord is battling
[26:49] mentally lord god is battling lord
[26:52] spiritually father we battling
[26:54] physically lord with health lord god
[26:56] battling with doubts
[26:58] uh lord god i pray that this this would

[27:03] the speaker father god we invite you to
[27:05] come in tonight lord god meet our needs
[27:08] lord jesus we are a needy people lord
[27:10] god your bride father is the neediest
[27:12] people lord here on this earth
[27:14] and lord god we totally depend on you
[27:17] lord we just commit ourselves into your
[27:19] hands now during this time we love you
[27:21] and we appreciate you in jesus christ
[27:23] and we pray amen
[27:25] amen
[27:27] philippians chapter 4 verse 4 it says
[27:29] rejoice in the lord all way
[27:33] and again i say rejoice
[27:36] let your moderation be known unto all
[27:38] men
[27:39] the lord is at hand
[27:42] amen be careful for nothing be careful
[27:45] for nothing in other words don't worry
[27:47] about anything
[27:49] don't worry about anything the world is
[27:50] falling apart all around us but paul
[27:52] says don't worry about anything
[27:55] but in everything and everything
[27:58] by prayer and supplication
[28:02] with thanksgiving
[28:04] let your requests be made known unto god
[28:07] and i like the way he says there by with
[28:09] thanksgiving in other words as you're
[28:11] praying you're already thanking god for
[28:13] answering your prayer
[28:15] amen with thanksgiving
[28:18] praise the lord
[28:20] let your requests be made known unto god
[28:22] and the peace watch what happens when
[28:24] you do this and the peace of god
[28:27] which passeth all understanding which
[28:30] you try to seek on your own but you're
[28:32] not going to be able to do it so
[28:34] therefore do as paul says here
[28:37] and when you do that the peace of god
[28:38] which passeth all understanding shall
[28:40] keep your hearts
[28:42] and minds
[28:44] through who through christ jesus
[28:47] now watch verse 8 says finally brethren
[28:49] whatsoever things are true
[28:53] we know the word is true
[28:55] whatsoever things are honest and we know
[28:58] the word is honest
[28:59] whatsoever things are just
[29:01] we know the word is just
[29:03] whatsoever things are pure and we know
[29:06] the word is pure
[29:07] whatsoever things are lovely we know the
[29:10] word of god is lovely whatsoever things
[29:13] are of good report
[29:15] that's a good report
[29:17] it's not a cnn report
[29:19] it's god's report
[29:20] [Laughter]
[29:22] amen if there be any virtue
[29:25] and if there be any praise
[29:27] think on these things
[29:30] amen
[29:31] those things which now what look paul
[29:33] says here those things which he have
[29:35] learned
[29:36] and received and heard and seen in me
[29:39] my goodness paul sounds like he's being
[29:42] haughty and and and
[29:44] who does he think he is but he had an
[29:46] experience with god
[29:47] he met god
[29:48] and they saw in so much that he could
[29:50] say amen the things that you have seen
[29:52] in me watch what he says
[29:54] do
[29:56] and the god of peace shall be with you
[29:59] amen
[30:00] and then while i still have you standing
[30:02] let's go to romans 12 verse 1 through 2
[30:06] and he says there i beseech you
[30:08] therefore brethren paul's still speaking
[30:10] here by the mercies of god that ye
[30:12] present your bodies
[30:14] a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto
[30:17] god
[30:18] which is your reasonable service
[30:21] and then he says here and be not
[30:23] conformed to this world
[30:26] be not conformed
[30:27] in other words don't be molded into this
[30:30] world
[30:31] but be ye transformed
[30:34] amen don't be conformed be transformed
[30:38] by the renewing of your mind
[30:41] amen
[30:43] that ye may prove what is that good and
[30:46] acceptable and perfect will of god amen
[30:49] you may be seated this afternoon
[30:57] amen
[30:59] think on these things amen
[31:01] now the
[31:03] new living uh
[31:05] uh version
[31:07] of of romans 12 2 it says it like this
[31:10] it says
[31:11] don't copy the behavior and customs of
[31:14] this world
[31:16] hmm
[31:18] don't copy the behavior and customs of
[31:21] this world
[31:22] of course when you're not a christian
[31:24] you will do less like the world you will
[31:27] act and you will talk and you will think
[31:29] like the world because that's what
[31:31] attracts you
[31:33] amen
[31:34] if a christian the word of god is what's
[31:36] attractive to him or her
[31:38] but to uh but to a a a a person that
[31:41] doesn't believe
[31:42] the world and its behaviors and its
[31:45] customs and its way of thinking that's
[31:47] what will attract them but paul clearly
[31:49] says here don't copy the behavior and
[31:51] customs of this world
[31:53] but but let god transform you into a new
[31:57] person
[31:58] by changing the way you think
[32:01] amen
[32:02] by changing the way you think
[32:05] amen it's by changing the way you think
[32:07] you know
[32:09] nothing that has happened in your life
[32:11] or nothing that has happened in in as
[32:13] you lived your out your life has not
[32:16] happened without you thinking about it
[32:17] first
[32:18] amen
[32:20] you thought about this this afternoon
[32:22] you thought about i need to get in my
[32:23] car and drop the church and guess what
[32:25] happened your church
[32:28] right
[32:29] you know that that's a creative
[32:31] thing about the human
[32:33] human being that you can think it and it
[32:35] can come to pass
[32:37] because god created us in his image and
[32:39] in his likeness and and he's a creator
[32:42] therefore the his thoughts
[32:45] are are are are and when he speaks amen
[32:48] those are his thoughts expressed
[32:50] amen
[32:52] so he says here paul says here let uh
[32:55] god transform you into a new person by
[32:57] changing the way you think then you will
[32:59] learn to know god's will for you
[33:01] which is good and pleasing and perfect
[33:05] uh good pleasing and perfect amen
[33:08] so what does paul hear say that that we
[33:11] need to have our mind renewed amen he
[33:13] was talking to believers here
[33:16] all right
[33:17] because we don't get everything in the
[33:18] new birth
[33:19] we don't we get we get our soul is
[33:22] transformed amen
[33:24] we get god's spirit
[33:26] but we still have to fight a nature amen
[33:29] we still have to fight that spirit man
[33:32] amen we still have to fight that thing
[33:35] and then paul even had to fight it
[33:38] he said himself that i had he had to die
[33:41] daily
[33:42] how much more us
[33:43] amen the ones that we cannot even say
[33:46] hey
[33:47] we cannot even say hey follow me as i
[33:48] follow christ can you say that to
[33:50] somebody amen
[33:53] paul could
[33:55] and yet he had to die daily
[33:58] and yet he had trouble amen even in his
[34:01] own flesh in his own spirit amen
[34:04] how much more us in the hour that we're
[34:06] living in amen where everything is so
[34:09] seductive and everything is so
[34:11] tempting and everything is so gray and
[34:14] everything is so mixed and man if you
[34:16] want to be a woman when you're a man you
[34:18] can be a woman if you want to be a
[34:20] transsexual when you're when you're a
[34:22] man or or
[34:23] or homosexual or whatever you want to be
[34:25] you could just be it
[34:27] because the world said so because
[34:29] doctors say it's okay
[34:32] because they know more than god
[34:35] so they think
[34:38] and they'll get a big surprise
[34:40] really soon i believe
[34:42] amen
[34:43] so if our thinking was okay
[34:46] already then paul wouldn't have said
[34:48] this
[34:49] he wouldn't have said to have your minds
[34:52] be renewed
[34:54] amen we need to have our minds renewed
[34:56] because daily as christians we're
[34:58] constantly battling amen devils amen
[35:01] from left and right
[35:03] amen if you're not battling then you're
[35:05] not a christian
[35:07] that's just simple as that you're not
[35:09] battling become a christian then you'll
[35:11] know what battling is all about but when
[35:13] you're a christian you battle man you
[35:16] have struggles and you have fights and
[35:18] you have you have things amen within you
[35:20] amen that you got us wrestle with
[35:23] amen and satan knows exactly where to
[35:27] punch at you more
[35:28] amen
[35:29] so
[35:30] so it's it's up to us amen what what
[35:33] what we let form us saints
[35:36] amen
[35:37] it's up to us
[35:38] and how we choose what we let form us is
[35:41] by is by choosing what we think and how
[35:43] we think about those things amen
[35:47] so if you're thinking about things amen
[35:49] positive things and and and and
[35:52] constantly thinking about god then what
[35:54] are you gonna be like
[35:57] amen
[35:59] amen there's a scripture here that we'll
[36:01] read later amen but but
[36:03] in psalms chapter one where he's where
[36:05] he david says
[36:07] blessed is the man that that that
[36:09] meditates on his law day and night
[36:13] day and night
[36:15] what are you meditating on
[36:17] amen
[36:19] is it your music
[36:22] is it your video games
[36:24] is it your job
[36:26] is it your your ideas
[36:29] amen your own ideas they're outside of
[36:31] the word of god
[36:33] amen
[36:34] and that's what you'll become whatever
[36:37] you meditate on
[36:39] praise the lord jesus
[36:41] and so and so and looking at thoughts we
[36:44] know that thoughts they're they're
[36:45] transforming
[36:47] amen they transform
[36:48] thoughts are very important i don't even
[36:50] think i don't even think that we have
[36:52] given the importance of thoughts like we
[36:55] should
[36:57] amen because they remember what created
[36:59] the heavens and the earth
[37:01] it was the thought of god and he spoke
[37:03] it and it became
[37:05] amen
[37:06] what caused you to be here remember what
[37:08] i said a while ago you thought about
[37:10] getting in that car
[37:12] and it became the past
[37:14] amen
[37:15] praise the lord later on you're going to
[37:17] have thoughts right now you're even
[37:18] having thoughts about the things you're
[37:20] about to do after the service
[37:23] and if you fulfill those things that
[37:25] means those were thoughts expressed
[37:28] amen
[37:29] maybe you speak about them first maybe
[37:31] after we get out of service you're going
[37:33] to tell somebody i'm going to cook out
[37:34] and get me a burger
[37:36] and then i'm going home to bed
[37:39] man enjoy your heartburn after that
[37:45] i had me some onion rings with it too
[37:47] yeah and a and uh cookies and cream milk
[37:49] shake
[37:51] man that's a recipe for a heartburn
[37:52] right there
[37:53] throughout the night
[37:55] man i've certainly had some of those on
[37:57] thursday mornings
[37:59] during the night after a wednesday night
[38:01] goodness gracious
[38:03] but it's good
[38:05] but see that's your thoughts right
[38:07] and your thoughts will manifest into
[38:09] actions and will manifest into things
[38:12] amen praise the lord that's how god's
[38:14] thoughts are
[38:16] and his thoughts are serious
[38:19] his thoughts are real
[38:21] amen
[38:22] we wouldn't have the animals we wouldn't
[38:24] have the plants we wouldn't have the
[38:25] trees the the mountains the seas the
[38:27] lakes the rivers the things that we
[38:29] enjoy amen the sun moon and stars we
[38:32] wouldn't enjoy none of these things if
[38:34] god's thoughts amen weren't there first
[38:36] and then he spoke them
[38:39] praise the lord so thoughts are creative
[38:43] thoughts are important right
[38:45] thoughts are very very very very
[38:47] important praise the lord jesus
[38:51] and so
[38:52] thoughts they relate to words
[38:55] and we know that words they're highly
[38:57] important
[38:58] amen what you say
[39:01] or don't say
[39:02] amen can make the difference
[39:05] praise the lord jesus he puts us
[39:07] preachers amen sometimes on the spot
[39:08] [Laughter]
[39:10] amen sometimes there you could say
[39:12] something right there at the right
[39:14] moment at the right time it may cause
[39:15] somebody a man to receive their healing
[39:17] right there and then
[39:19] amen and sometimes you can say some
[39:22] things amen that would just
[39:24] dampen the the holy spirit and cause
[39:27] people to miss their healing
[39:29] amen
[39:30] so words are very important and what are
[39:32] words their thoughts expressed
[39:36] or in other words they're also a thought
[39:38] capsule or thought
[39:40] containers think about it that way
[39:44] amen you ever taken a capsule
[39:47] with some medicine in it
[39:49] that's just a portion of the big storage
[39:52] of medicine of that of that medicine
[39:55] that they have somewhere else amen a
[39:56] little capsule of whatever you're taking
[39:58] amen
[40:01] that amen has
[40:03] that has power that has potential to
[40:04] help you in whatever way he needs to
[40:06] amen but that's what words are there
[40:09] they're expressions of thoughts
[40:11] amen you're when you're when you say
[40:14] something you have to think it first
[40:16] then you say it
[40:18] sometimes we have to think longer than
[40:20] others
[40:22] and some of us we should think longer
[40:24] than others before we even say things
[40:28] amen
[40:30] you know i watched this thing the other
[40:31] day and it said the the power of silence
[40:35] there's power in silence
[40:37] sometimes it's better just to not even
[40:38] say anything
[40:40] and that makes the other person
[40:42] uh unsure
[40:44] you know insecure you know oh man what's
[40:46] going on the power of silence sometimes
[40:49] we need more like thing silence
[40:52] and thinking we always need to say
[40:53] something
[40:54] amen
[40:56] praise god
[40:57] because sometimes by saying things we
[40:59] might do more damage than good
[41:01] amen praise the lord jesus
[41:04] amen you know when i'm interpreting here
[41:08] if i'm interpreting for a minister you
[41:09] know into the english or spanish
[41:11] language
[41:14] oftentimes i'm interpreting and i get in
[41:16] that in that in that channel so much
[41:19] and if the brother is preaching i
[41:21] oftentimes
[41:22] know what he's getting ready to save
[41:24] even before he says it
[41:26] because i can get into the channel of
[41:28] his thoughts and if it's the holy spirit
[41:31] speaking through him amen then then that
[41:34] god that's in me can be able to grab
[41:37] those thoughts and be able to speak them
[41:40] to the people interpreting whether it's
[41:41] in the english or spanish language
[41:44] amen that's how powerful amen the
[41:46] thoughts thoughts are amen
[41:48] praise god
[41:50] thought thought containers amen thought
[41:52] capsules
[41:53] praise the lord jesus brother brown says
[41:56] here in the message
[41:57] law or grace
[41:59] uh so the question is what are god's
[42:01] thoughts
[42:02] he says here you know sunday how we got
[42:04] into it we when god speaks it has to be
[42:07] so
[42:08] all right
[42:09] there's no way at all to get away from
[42:12] it god says let there be
[42:15] and it has to be
[42:17] nothing
[42:18] the very word itself and the word was a
[42:21] thought
[42:22] god when he before a word is an
[42:24] expression of a thought god thought it
[42:27] in his mind spoke it into existence amen
[42:31] and then in the message god hiding
[42:32] himself in simplicity he says here
[42:35] now with the blood of bulls and goats
[42:37] watch this if the blood of bulls and
[42:39] goats
[42:41] could give a power to moses to go out
[42:44] there by the commission of god and
[42:46] stretch forth that rod and say let there
[42:49] come flies
[42:51] he had the word of god and he spoke that
[42:53] word and when he did
[42:55] it become from god's thought a word is a
[42:58] thought expressed
[43:00] amen
[43:01] so in other words before moses could
[43:03] speak it it had to be in the mind of god
[43:05] first then he gave it to moses then
[43:07] moses could speak it then it came to be
[43:09] right
[43:10] praise god and so then when god thought
[43:12] it and put it in moses's mind and he
[43:14] spoke it it become a word
[43:17] and moses turned around and went back
[43:19] maybe maybe not a fly in the country
[43:25] when he spoke it
[43:26] i wonder if that's how we feel sometimes
[43:28] hey man when we speak god's word amen we
[43:30] don't see immediate changes
[43:33] i mean i wonder if moses didn't get
[43:35] discouraged there for a moment
[43:37] maybe he didn't see a fly but watch what
[43:40] brother branham says and and moses
[43:42] turned around and went back and maybe
[43:43] not a fly in the country in an hour from
[43:45] then maybe one old green fly began to
[43:48] buzz around
[43:50] amen in a half hour there was 10 pounds
[43:53] per square yard
[43:55] what was it
[43:56] the creative word of god that was spoke
[43:58] by the lips of a mortal man
[44:01] amen all moses had to do was just speak
[44:04] what he was given
[44:05] he didn't have to think about how to how
[44:08] to make it you know make it to come to
[44:10] pass
[44:11] he just needed to speak it and wait
[44:14] god will take care of the rest
[44:16] amen it's god's original thought it's
[44:18] god's creative thought it's god's
[44:20] eternal thought and therefore it has to
[44:22] manifest itself
[44:24] because god can't and he can never what
[44:28] he can never change he can never fail
[44:31] amen
[44:33] his original thought
[44:35] amen will always be it will never that's
[44:38] the reason why we can say and the word
[44:39] of god says that he the world will pass
[44:42] away but his thoughts
[44:44] will never pass away
[44:47] his word will never pass away amen those
[44:51] are his thoughts expressed this word
[44:52] that you and me are reading
[44:54] are his thoughts
[44:56] praise god
[44:58] amen you might be saying amen lord you
[45:00] you're claiming something you're
[45:02] claiming your children you're cleaning
[45:03] your healing whatever it is amen you may
[45:05] not see any fruition right there but
[45:07] just wait
[45:09] just wait
[45:10] amen because when you're expressing
[45:13] god's word those are those are his
[45:15] eternal thoughts they've got to have a
[45:17] creative action behind it
[45:20] something's going to happen
[45:21] if you stay right with it
[45:23] amen it's not about it's not you don't
[45:26] have to
[45:27] work up anything let god do the work
[45:30] amen it was god that put the flies in
[45:32] there amen it was god that created the
[45:34] squirrels amen all brother brandon did
[45:37] was just give receive the thought and he
[45:38] spoke it and there the squirrels was
[45:41] praise god
[45:43] and it's god amen that will be the one
[45:45] to change your children it was going to
[45:47] be god the one to change amen your give
[45:50] you the healing in your body praise god
[45:53] all you got to do is confess his
[45:55] thoughts
[45:56] amen
[45:58] continue in his thought and his word
[46:03] that's all we care about
[46:05] what did paul said he said think on
[46:07] these things
[46:09] whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever
[46:11] things are right or just are pure and
[46:15] all that are the correct characteristics
[46:17] of the jesus christ
[46:19] and he is what
[46:20] the word
[46:21] and he is the thoughts
[46:24] of god
[46:25] amen praise the lord jesus how many are
[46:27] still with me
[46:30] praise the lord
[46:32] so we see that god's thoughts
[46:34] saints they are revealed in his word
[46:37] and we see that they're revealed by his
[46:39] creation amen we see the creation
[46:42] the mountains everything we see around
[46:44] us they're god's thoughts expressed
[46:46] praise the lord amen
[46:49] and
[46:49] amen when he created the the way that
[46:52] the animals to procreate that was god's
[46:54] thoughts
[46:56] when satan's thought
[46:59] it was god's thought
[47:01] praise the lord
[47:02] when he created the law of procreation
[47:04] for a human man and a human woman to
[47:06] procreate that was god's thoughts
[47:09] amen
[47:11] of course originally it was by the word
[47:13] praise the lord but god by his
[47:15] permissive will amen he's allowed the
[47:17] way to that we come about in this in
[47:19] this what in this hour and you know what
[47:21] when it's done right when it's done in
[47:24] order it's a beautiful thing
[47:26] but when you go outside of the word of
[47:27] god amen to try to do that
[47:30] outside of his word
[47:33] amen
[47:34] to defile a girl or
[47:37] to defile yourself in in that way amen
[47:40] that's contrary to god's word that's not
[47:42] in god's original thinking
[47:44] amen praise god
[47:46] see the world they've perverted these
[47:48] original thoughts of god
[47:50] amen
[47:52] they they perverted it look look
[47:55] because
[47:57] all we see today saints is an attack on
[48:00] life
[48:02] i don't know if have you watched the
[48:04] news lately
[48:05] or if you just
[48:07] it has been an attack on life period
[48:11] which in turn is an attack on
[48:13] christianity which in turn is an attack
[48:15] on god
[48:17] amen
[48:19] now
[48:20] i want us to to pay attention to this

[49:48] alternative lifestyles
[49:50] and we love them
[49:52] i believe god died for them too
[49:55] amen but we don't need to accept they
[49:57] meant their ideas and and them
[49:59] indoctrinating us amen and them forcing
[50:02] themselves on us through every avenue
[50:04] that there is out here amen because
[50:07] they're the ones amen we they're they're
[50:09] fighting something with us that we never
[50:10] picked with them
[50:12] amen i never went out to to to uh uh uh
[50:16] uh you know curse them or anything like
[50:19] that or i just leave them alone what you
[50:21] do in your bedroom is between you and
[50:23] god
[50:24] amen between you and satan
[50:26] amen
[50:29] that has nothing to do with me that has
[50:31] nothing to do with my children it has
[50:33] nothing to do with the church
[50:35] praise god but it's become now
[50:37] mainstream in such a way that now you
[50:40] must accept it
[50:42] it's what they tell you you you have to
[50:45] accept it
[50:46] and if you don't you're intolerant
[50:48] and and and and you're
[50:51] and you're hateful
[50:52] amen and all these groups amen
[50:55] these and i'm i'm just going to say it
[50:58] black lives matter and all these groups
[51:00] say man they support all those agendas
[51:03] they're even their leaders
[51:05] black lives matter amen they support
[51:07] they say we
[51:09] we go the marxist ways
[51:11] that's their original
[51:13] the leader i have a video of the leader
[51:15] of the black lives matters they say we
[51:17] our agenda is the marxist way and what
[51:19] and what is
[51:20] marxist way is communism supporting
[51:24] homosexuality supporting these these
[51:27] things amen it's not about race
[51:29] they're about trying to transform
[51:31] a society amen so that you can accept
[51:35] their their perverse lifestyles
[51:39] and they're trying to destroy satan
[51:41] through those groups and through and
[51:42] through our governments are trying to
[51:44] destroy christianity and you think it's
[51:47] all about race
[51:49] and it's not
[51:50] i want you to think about those things
[51:52] before we go out there supporting and
[51:54] holding our fists and all those types of
[51:56] things think about what you're
[51:57] supporting and look at the history of
[51:59] these things
[52:00] amen because it's not what you think it
[52:02] is it is not what you think it is
[52:06] right and so god said in it so satan's
[52:09] attack amen and this day on life is
[52:12] relentless we see it in every aspect
[52:15] but what does god say god said in
[52:18] genesis chapter five verse one and two
[52:20] he says this is the book of the
[52:21] generations of adam in the day that god
[52:24] created man
[52:26] in the likeness of god made he him
[52:29] amen
[52:33] i believe god is male
[52:35] amen
[52:36] amen
[52:38] praise the lord
[52:40] but watch in verse two he says male and
[52:42] female created he them now remember
[52:45] we're thinking about thoughts
[52:47] i'm not trying to offend anybody that's
[52:49] not my intention i think we need to talk
[52:52] about these things
[52:54] we don't talk about them enough
[52:56] because they are they are they are
[52:58] waving in into our society and they're
[53:00] weaving into our
[53:01] our youth
[53:02] and they're just accepting these things
[53:04] like it's normal and it's never been
[53:06] normal in the eyes of god
[53:09] it's never been normal
[53:12] male and female i don't see any other
[53:15] gender there
[53:17] do you believe the word of god
[53:20] what do i see there
[53:22] male and female
[53:24] i don't see any uh other gender in there
[53:28] i don't see uh uh you know whatever
[53:31] genders they have out there now
[53:34] they got this long string of names now
[53:37] lgbtq
[53:39] a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p it is
[53:42] whatever you want
[53:44] remember we're living in the age of the
[53:46] of the pale horse rider
[53:48] it's a mixture of everything and you
[53:50] could just be whatever you want and it's
[53:52] okay
[53:53] but remember it all started from from
[53:56] death
[53:57] it all started from death amen
[54:00] praise god
[54:01] see the word and so it says here male
[54:03] and female created he them and blessed
[54:05] them and called their name adam
[54:08] in the day when they were created
[54:10] praise god
[54:12] now the world says it's okay to be
[54:14] whatever gender you want to be
[54:17] but what does god say amen
[54:19] amen male and female created he them
[54:24] see
[54:26] there's people out there that have they
[54:28] have they were born males
[54:30] they've transformed to females by
[54:33] surgeries pills or whatever
[54:35] and now they regret doing what they did
[54:38] i've watched already several
[54:40] documentaries about that
[54:42] and then when they try to transform back
[54:44] it ain't the same
[54:46] it's because you've put your thoughts
[54:49] into what god originally made you to be
[54:52] and now you're you're really a
[54:54] perversion then
[54:56] you're really a perversion then
[54:59] because you put your own thing into it
[55:03] right but see that's not what they're
[55:04] going to tell they're not going to tell
[55:05] you that in school
[55:07] they're not going to tell you that
[55:08] society's not going to tell you that
[55:12] however you feel that's how you should
[55:14] be
[55:15] they go by feelings
[55:18] and if you feel it then that's that's
[55:20] then express yourself that way be
[55:22] prideful about it when god says that the
[55:24] hottie uh it will be destroyed
[55:28] pride will be what will be brought down
[55:30] but these people are prideful
[55:34] we might get shut down by youtube for
[55:36] this
[55:37] well it's all right maybe it's time
[55:40] let me tell you what there's going to
[55:41] come a day where when they're going
[55:43] they're going to come right through here
[55:45] shut these doors and everything like
[55:46] that what are you going to do then
[55:49] you're going to have to face these
[55:51] things amen our young people are facing
[55:52] them so you might as well not just oh
[55:54] well they let them let them let you know
[55:57] they'll they'll figure it out themselves
[55:59] no you as the parent has to deal with
[56:02] these things you as the parent have to
[56:05] take time with your children explain
[56:07] these things they may tell them the
[56:09] truth
[56:10] amen
[56:12] tell them the truth
[56:15] they might not like it but it's the
[56:17] truth because it's from the word
[56:19] they're not mad at you they're mad at
[56:21] the god amen
[56:23] praise god
[56:25] see the world says it's okay to be
[56:26] whatever gender you want to be
[56:29] but let me tell you
[56:30] that you can change your gender you can
[56:33] come to this world and be a man you can
[56:35] come to this world as a woman as a
[56:38] female and change your gender or
[56:40] whatever but when you die and they dig
[56:42] up your bones the dna will show and the
[56:45] bones will show what you really were
[56:48] the the bones will not they they won't
[56:51] say oh this was a male turned into a
[56:53] woman or this is a woman turn into a no
[56:55] the bones will say what you were from
[56:57] the beginning
[56:59] because it speaks of the beginning it
[57:01] always speaks of the original life of
[57:03] god
[57:04] you can never get away from that
[57:07] the world thinks tells you that you can
[57:10] but you can't you like you can die and a
[57:14] hundred years later they'll dig up your
[57:15] bones
[57:16] and you say you're a male when you were
[57:18] a woman amen they'll know that you're a
[57:20] woman by the way your body was shaped by
[57:23] the way you are
[57:26] they'll know that but people nowadays
[57:28] don't know that
[57:30] but a hundred years from now they'll
[57:32] know that
[57:33] when they dig up your bones
[57:36] do you understand what i'm saying
[57:38] it's a ridiculous idea and it's satanic
[57:41] praise god
[57:46] and they tell you that the homosexual
[57:47] lifestyles are okay and the lesbian
[57:50] lifestyles are okay and we should just
[57:52] be acceptive and not tolerate it amen
[57:55] not not when they're trying to
[57:56] indoctrinate my children no
[57:59] no
[58:02] no
[58:04] i mean and i want us to think about this
[58:06] for just a moment
[58:11] think about this
[58:13] do you believe that god is pro-life
[58:16] you know there's a hot topic right now
[58:17] about about
[58:19] about
[58:20] about babies i got this article right
[58:22] here that i want to read here not the
[58:24] whole thing but
[58:25] disgusting things that they
[58:27] california and some of these
[58:30] democrat states amen
[58:34] but i'm not talking about this i'm
[58:35] talking about as far as
[58:37] the homosexual and lesbian lifestyle and
[58:39] all that stuff
[58:41] we believe that god is pro-life right
[58:44] right
[58:45] but we know he's alive i mean he created
[58:46] the heavens and the earth he created the
[58:48] animals he created you
[58:51] and you are living right now not by your
[58:53] own will
[58:54] but by god at this very moment no matter
[58:57] how rebellious you are no matter how
[58:59] haughty or prideful you are god could
[59:01] stop your heart at this very moment
[59:04] where would you be then
[59:07] but you're living and you're sitting
[59:09] here amen by the grace of god
[59:16] by the grace of god your heart could
[59:18] stop at this very moment
[59:21] and you think that you're so big and bad
[59:26] and you don't even control the life that
[59:28] runs through you through you right
[59:30] now some of us young people
[59:34] we think we're all so big and bad and we
[59:36] got it all under control
[59:38] amen
[59:39] you don't control anything
[59:41] god controls you
[59:44] you have no control amen god could stop
[59:46] your shut you down right now at this
[59:48] very moment he's done it in the past and
[59:50] do it again
[59:52] so how should we live
[59:55] how should we live
[59:57] so is god is god pro-life i believe he
[1:00:00] is
[1:00:00] he loves life he's the originator of
[1:00:03] life he is life amen
[1:00:06] and in him there's no darkness amen
[1:00:08] he said i am the bread of life
[1:00:11] right
[1:00:12] praise god but let me ask you this
[1:00:14] question
[1:00:15] so if god is pro-life
[1:00:17] then that must mean
[1:00:20] that satan is what
[1:00:24] anti-life
[1:00:26] right
[1:00:27] now i mean the bible says that the enemy
[1:00:29] has come to kill steal and destroy
[1:00:33] he say he satan is like a royal lion
[1:00:36] seeking whom he may devour and when a
[1:00:38] lion devours something it's not being
[1:00:40] devoured alive or
[1:00:42] i mean it is maybe but then eventually
[1:00:44] it dies
[1:00:48] so
[1:00:49] let's do two plus two
[1:00:51] or one plus one
[1:00:53] so if god is pro-life
[1:00:55] and satan is anti-life
[1:00:58] when they tell you it's okay for two men
[1:01:01] to get married
[1:01:02] it's okay for two women to get married
[1:01:04] but they can't procreate
[1:01:06] they can't bring forth life
[1:01:09] right
[1:01:10] so what agenda is that
[1:01:13] it's satan's anti-god agenda anti-life
[1:01:16] agenda
[1:01:20] what is being promoted is
[1:01:22] anti-life because two men can't have
[1:01:25] babies i'm just gonna be raw here
[1:01:28] two women can't have babies therefore
[1:01:30] they got to go and and and and
[1:01:33] and uh uh
[1:01:35] what's the word
[1:01:36] adopt
[1:01:38] adopt
[1:01:40] and be adopted in that perversion yes i
[1:01:42] said it's a perversion
[1:01:44] because a baby is not going to grow up
[1:01:47] healthy with two men or two women as
[1:01:49] raising them this is never that's not
[1:01:52] how god created that what did we just
[1:01:53] read
[1:01:54] male and female created he them
[1:01:58] right
[1:02:02] i've never i've never i remember hearing
[1:02:04] this from the baptist church amen god
[1:02:06] created adam and eve
[1:02:08] not adam and steve
[1:02:12] amen
[1:02:13] it just doesn't work
[1:02:15] you're not going to have babies with
[1:02:17] two males you're not gonna have babies
[1:02:19] with two females but you will have
[1:02:21] babies with male and female
[1:02:24] and he blessed them and called their
[1:02:25] name adam amen here and in just a moment
[1:02:27] we will read another scripture
[1:02:30] so we got to understand saints that that
[1:02:33] satan is totally we're thinking about
[1:02:35] the thoughts of god right
[1:02:38] and i want us to touch upon these things
[1:02:40] because
[1:02:41] these are the here's the thought of god
[1:02:44] but then satan is bringing in his
[1:02:46] thoughts
[1:02:47] amen
[1:02:49] praise the lord and so he's always the
[1:02:51] opposite of god so we got to understand
[1:02:53] that satan is anti-life
[1:02:56] praise the lord
[1:02:58] and so
[1:03:00] satan these agendas have been presented
[1:03:02] because satan hates procreation between
[1:03:05] a man and a woman in marriage
[1:03:07] all right
[1:03:08] you can write these down if you want
[1:03:10] he hates the family
[1:03:13] he hates the family he he knows that
[1:03:17] that that families are backbones
[1:03:20] of of a country
[1:03:22] backbones of of a church
[1:03:24] amen they have power
[1:03:27] especially when they have god as a
[1:03:30] as as their main
[1:03:32] as the one they worship
[1:03:34] satan hates healthy relationships
[1:03:36] between a husband and a wife
[1:03:39] amen
[1:03:40] satan hates relationships between
[1:03:42] parents and children
[1:03:45] oh he hates that
[1:03:47] and he'll do anything to try to destroy
[1:03:50] that that relationship
[1:03:52] amen between the children and the parent
[1:03:55] amen
[1:03:56] satan hates the potential that man has
[1:03:59] for positive change
[1:04:01] amen
[1:04:02] especially when they have the holy
[1:04:04] spirit
[1:04:06] amen
[1:04:07] amen that even people without the holy
[1:04:09] spirit can bring positive change
[1:04:12] amen
[1:04:15] satan hates the image of god which is in
[1:04:17] man
[1:04:18] you don't have to be a christian to be
[1:04:20] the image of god every man was created
[1:04:22] in the image of god
[1:04:24] amen praise the lord satan hates life
[1:04:27] and again satan hates god
[1:04:31] that's the reason why these agendas and
[1:04:33] these lifestyles are promoted to you as
[1:04:35] normality and they are not
[1:04:39] the bible tells me so and i'm just going
[1:04:41] to believe what the bible says i don't
[1:04:43] care what joe biden says and i don't
[1:04:44] care what gensake says i don't care what
[1:04:47] anybody says amen the bible tells me
[1:04:50] that male and female created heath then
[1:04:55] amen
[1:04:56] demi lovato she comes out as as
[1:04:58] non-binary what is that i didn't see
[1:05:00] that in that verse
[1:05:02] what is a non-binary
[1:05:06] i just read male and female yeah
[1:05:08] oh but you got to just be tolerant
[1:05:10] they're non-bilinear it's not in the
[1:05:11] word of god the word is not that word is
[1:05:14] not even in the word of god why do i
[1:05:16] have to tolerate that
[1:05:20] sam smith miley cyrus all of these
[1:05:22] they've come out as non-binaries and
[1:05:24] some of young people know may know who
[1:05:26] i'm talking about
[1:05:29] homosexuals right now today that you
[1:05:32] might even listen to little nas x
[1:05:35] anderson cooper from cnn you get your
[1:05:37] news from from from gays

[1:05:46] tim cook the one who's produced our
[1:05:48] apple products he's proudly gay
[1:05:54] and so that's why you see when you see
[1:05:55] in there on their websites and all these
[1:05:57] things they're promoting the those those
[1:05:59] those rainbow flags and all that stuff
[1:06:01] it's because they themselves live it
[1:06:04] and they they want you to go ahead and
[1:06:06] think it's okay
[1:06:09] but the word of god tells me it's not
[1:06:11] all i see is male and female i keep
[1:06:14] reiterating that thought because that's
[1:06:16] the thought of god amen
[1:06:19] and i want people on youtube to listen
[1:06:20] to
[1:06:23] our lesbians of today's ellen degeneres
[1:06:26] caller ellen degeneret
[1:06:30] but we listened to her show
[1:06:31] regularly
[1:06:33] watch her show
[1:06:36] elliott page jody foster rosie o'donnell
[1:06:39] the lesbians who have come out of the
[1:06:41] closet and and they're just proud
[1:06:44] they want you to think that their
[1:06:45] lifestyle is okay
[1:06:48] i don't see it in the bible
[1:06:50] all i see is male and female
[1:06:52] praise the lord
[1:06:54] amen
[1:06:55] in genesis 1 26 brother way's favorite
[1:06:57] verse says and god said let us make man
[1:07:00] in our image after our likeness
[1:07:03] and let them have dominion you see that
[1:07:07] god wants man to have dominion amen
[1:07:10] over the fish of the sea and over the
[1:07:12] fall of the air and over the cattle and
[1:07:13] over all the earth and over every
[1:07:15] creeping thing that creepeth upon the
[1:07:17] earth amen even the cockroaches
[1:07:21] amen
[1:07:23] god created man in his own verse 27 so
[1:07:25] god created man in his own image in the
[1:07:28] image of god created
[1:07:31] he him
[1:07:33] male and female created he them there it
[1:07:36] is again
[1:07:38] i don't see non-binary
[1:07:42] i don't see any other gender there
[1:07:44] i see male and female
[1:07:48] wow
[1:07:50] and god blessed them and god said unto
[1:07:52] them be fruitful
[1:07:53] a non-binary can't be fruitful a lesbian
[1:07:56] can't be fruitful a homosexual can't be
[1:07:59] fruitful
[1:08:00] and multiply
[1:08:02] they can't do it how do you do it
[1:08:05] amen and replenish the earth
[1:08:07] and subdue it
[1:08:09] see that can only happen if it's a male
[1:08:11] and a female
[1:08:12] i'm just you know just
[1:08:15] so that you can understand god's
[1:08:17] thoughts
[1:08:18] young people understand god's thoughts
[1:08:21] don't take in the world's thoughts
[1:08:24] don't you don't have to accept the
[1:08:25] world's thoughts
[1:08:27] remember the world will pass away but
[1:08:29] god's thoughts will never pass away
[1:08:33] amen praise god
[1:08:36] so saints any thought opposed to this
[1:08:40] scripture is anti-life and therefore is
[1:08:42] anti-god
[1:08:44] they don't want people to procreate
[1:08:47] they don't want people to uh uh uh
[1:08:50] you know
[1:08:51] you can think whatever
[1:08:53] but you can go down to i forget what
[1:08:55] part of georgia it is
[1:08:58] they got these stones right
[1:09:00] there they're
[1:09:01] they're sitting there two stones
[1:09:04] and and uh
[1:09:06] elberton georgia that's it
[1:09:08] and one of them one of the top is like
[1:09:10] their commandments
[1:09:12] and one of them is to keep the
[1:09:13] population and one of the says is keep
[1:09:15] the population under 500 million
[1:09:20] why would somebody write that
[1:09:24] so they have agendas and this is part of
[1:09:26] their agenda
[1:09:28] amen
[1:09:29] this is anti-life
[1:09:32] anti-anti-anti-god amen
[1:09:36] and since satan is anti-life and
[1:09:38] anti-god
[1:09:40] therefore aborting or killing innocent
[1:09:42] babies is anti-life and
[1:09:45] it's legalized murder
[1:09:49] that's what it is oh brother luis you
[1:09:51] shouldn't talk about those things you
[1:09:53] shouldn't talk about politics over the
[1:09:54] pulpit
[1:09:56] but you face it every single day
[1:09:59] i'm just talking about god's thoughts
[1:10:01] versus man's thoughts
[1:10:03] satan's thoughts i'm talking about life
[1:10:06] amen
[1:10:08] praise god
[1:10:12] just just real quick this is just in
[1:10:14] march
[1:10:15] just a few months ago
[1:10:17] california bill would allow killing
[1:10:19] babies in infanticide
[1:10:22] up to 28 days after birth
[1:10:26] so not just in the womb
[1:10:28] but the baby can be born
[1:10:31] outside
[1:10:32] the mom can take it home
[1:10:34] and if she decides i don't want it
[1:10:35] anymore
[1:10:36] it can
[1:10:38] 28 days after birth this was on
[1:10:40] this was on uh
[1:10:44] forgot what website this is life news i
[1:10:46] think
[1:10:48] california policymakers who make up the
[1:10:50] future abortion of abortion council just
[1:10:54] dropped a bombshell
[1:10:55] they intend to not only codify the
[1:10:58] killing of unborn children throughout
[1:11:00] all nine months of pregnancy but to
[1:11:01] decriminalize
[1:11:03] killing newborns
[1:11:05] days or even weeks after birth
[1:11:08] new language added to
[1:11:10] ab2223 which is their the the law last
[1:11:13] week
[1:11:14] revealed the disturbing intent the
[1:11:17] proposed legislation would shield a
[1:11:19] mother from civil and criminal charges
[1:11:21] for any actions or omissions
[1:11:24] related to her pregnancy
[1:11:26] including miscarriage stillbirth or
[1:11:28] abortion or pr prenata uh prenatal death
[1:11:32] although definitions of
[1:11:34] perinatal death vary all of them include
[1:11:36] the demise of newborns seven days or
[1:11:38] more after birth
[1:11:40] can you imagine that
[1:11:42] that's that's that's that's what they're
[1:11:44] thinking
[1:11:45] and that thought didn't come from god
[1:11:48] the bill from assemblywoman buffy wicks
[1:11:52] additionally protects anyone who aids or
[1:11:55] assists a pregnant person in exercising
[1:11:58] these rights
[1:12:00] it also allows a woman to sue any police
[1:12:02] department or legal authority which
[1:12:04] arrests or charges her for hurting or
[1:12:07] killing her child
[1:12:08] under provisions of the bill
[1:12:11] so in other words if the woman says i
[1:12:12] you know i want to just throw out the
[1:12:14] baby and kill it or whatever the cops
[1:12:16] can't go after her if they if they pass
[1:12:19] that
[1:12:20] governor newsome formed the future of
[1:12:22] abortion council last year governor
[1:12:24] newson
[1:12:27] in an effort to turn california into a
[1:12:29] sanctuary state for the procedure
[1:12:31] organizers listed ab2223 as part of
[1:12:34] their legislation package implementing a
[1:12:36] 45-point plan to expand and protect
[1:12:39] access to abortion in california
[1:12:42] a few weeks ago maryland introduced a
[1:12:45] bill that decriminalizes neglecting
[1:12:47] newborns to death
[1:12:49] using the same prenatal death language
[1:12:51] though the bill hearing was canceled was
[1:12:54] cancelled all right
[1:12:56] so that is what they are thinking about
[1:12:58] life
[1:13:02] amen so
[1:13:08] you young people
[1:13:11] amen how thankful you should be
[1:13:14] amen
[1:13:16] your parents didn't do that to you
[1:13:19] because that is what's happening right
[1:13:21] now
[1:13:24] amen do you have the opportunity to live
[1:13:28] you have the opportunity to grow work
[1:13:31] get married have children of your own
[1:13:34] amen do great things be creators
[1:13:37] amen
[1:13:39] not to waste your life away
[1:13:42] amen
[1:13:43] praise
[1:13:44] god i like that it's quiet
[1:13:48] you're either sleeping or you're
[1:13:49] listening
[1:13:51] praise the lord
[1:13:55] amen so what are god's thoughts about
[1:13:56] you
[1:13:59] here's what god thinks about you
[1:14:01] amen in jeremiah 29 11.
[1:14:06] he says for i know the thoughts that i
[1:14:08] think toward you
[1:14:11] saith the
[1:14:12] lord he said thoughts of peace
[1:14:16] and not of evil
[1:14:17] amen
[1:14:19] do you think this is evil
[1:14:21] so it's anti-god
[1:14:24] amen
[1:14:26] it can't be of god
[1:14:28] thoughts of peace and not of evil to
[1:14:30] give you what an expected end
[1:14:34] amen
[1:14:35] praise the lord jesus
[1:14:38] so he said adam and eve when they walked
[1:14:40] with the lord in the cool of the day
[1:14:43] you know when they were talking to god
[1:14:45] and god came down in the cool of the day
[1:14:47] what were they sharing
[1:14:49] they were sharing god's thoughts
[1:14:52] and probably god would come down and say
[1:14:54] adam eve you know
[1:14:57] what y'all been doing today it's not
[1:14:59] like he didn't know no
[1:15:02] but he wanted to talk with them
[1:15:04] and listen here i created this here this
[1:15:07] there because of this this this this and
[1:15:10] you see how this connects with this and
[1:15:11] this is the reason why for this and amen
[1:15:15] i believe he was sharing them with them
[1:15:16] thoughts of peace
[1:15:19] not thoughts of evil
[1:15:21] amen praise the lord jesus
[1:15:23] and i believe that's what god wants for
[1:15:25] each and every one of us but
[1:15:27] we have chaotic lives maybe we find
[1:15:29] ourselves in a chaotic
[1:15:31] life
[1:15:33] battling within yourself
[1:15:35] should i or should i not should i give
[1:15:37] up the world or should i serve the lord
[1:15:40] it's a battle
[1:15:42] amen
[1:15:44] but god is saying that he's given
[1:15:46] thoughts of peace
[1:15:48] not of evil and if you have turmoil in
[1:15:50] your life it's your own fault
[1:15:53] amen
[1:15:55] it's your own fault
[1:15:58] there's no need to be in turmoil
[1:16:00] when god has given us these thoughts of
[1:16:03] peace
[1:16:05] and not of evil
[1:16:07] amen praise the lord jesus
[1:16:11] so then god was coming down in the cool
[1:16:13] of the day talking with adam and eve
[1:16:15] sharing his thoughts amen but then here
[1:16:17] comes a sly
[1:16:20] satan comes in to share his thoughts
[1:16:25] see god has his thoughts and then satan
[1:16:27] has his thoughts
[1:16:28] right
[1:16:29] so he comes in
[1:16:31] and he makes sure that he gets uh eve
[1:16:34] all to himself
[1:16:39] he starts sharing his thoughts
[1:16:42] to eve now adam was not around
[1:16:45] because if adam was around he would have
[1:16:47] put a stop to it
[1:16:49] he was a son of god
[1:16:51] amen
[1:16:52] that's why young girls amen you need to
[1:16:54] be careful amen
[1:16:56] you don't need you have no business of
[1:16:58] being alone in a room with any guy
[1:17:02] you guys
[1:17:04] don't need to be in a room alone with
[1:17:06] any girls
[1:17:08] there's no there's no business for that
[1:17:10] that's not your wife
[1:17:12] if that's not your sister is that not
[1:17:14] your mom or if that's not your
[1:17:16] grandmother
[1:17:18] you don't need to be in that room alone
[1:17:19] with that girl
[1:17:24] especially when the dad's not around the
[1:17:26] mom's not around
[1:17:27] and when guys come to you slightly
[1:17:30] talking to you
[1:17:33] asking you inappropriate questions
[1:17:38] have you ever kissed guys before
[1:17:42] have you ever did this that or the other
[1:17:46] if this
[1:17:48] if you weren't this then maybe we could
[1:17:51] this could happen
[1:17:54] what kind of questions are those
[1:17:59] huh
[1:18:00] what are you trying to bring
[1:18:03] what what's your motive
[1:18:08] see that's inappropriate
[1:18:10] same thing with girls to guys
[1:18:12] what are you trying to do with that
[1:18:14] you're bypassing the the the the father
[1:18:17] you're bypassing the mother you're
[1:18:18] bypassing amen authority in order to to
[1:18:21] get that's what it seems like in order
[1:18:23] to get to that to that girl
[1:18:32] can hear that pin drop
[1:18:36] but it's inappropriate
[1:18:38] you don't do that
[1:18:40] girls you be careful when these slickers
[1:18:42] come around
[1:18:43] amen
[1:18:45] just like satan came around
[1:18:47] talking to eve made sure that adam was
[1:18:50] not around
[1:18:52] amen to talk to you about the about
[1:18:55] about inappropriate things
[1:19:00] what you need to do is you need to get
[1:19:02] out
[1:19:03] step away the bible says to the youth
[1:19:05] flee temptation
[1:19:08] flee youthful lusts
[1:19:11] amen in other words run
[1:19:13] run from those things because he knows
[1:19:16] paul knew that you can fall you can
[1:19:19] easily fall
[1:19:22] but if you sit there and let let the
[1:19:24] slicker talk to you and and and get into
[1:19:27] your mind
[1:19:29] oh but he likes me
[1:19:32] oh he's so
[1:19:35] oh look at his hair
[1:19:37] oh
[1:19:39] amen
[1:19:42] you know that's how satan came to eve
[1:19:44] didn't come to eve like a drunk with
[1:19:46] flies flying all around him all around
[1:19:48] you know
[1:19:49] hey
[1:19:50] you know i got
[1:19:54] i got something for you
[1:20:01] did god say
[1:20:08] he didn't come in like that
[1:20:11] he came in all slick
[1:20:13] amen
[1:20:15] amen maybe he was sharp maybe he even
[1:20:17] had a suit on
[1:20:23] all slick smelling good
[1:20:25] smelling like the latest style cologne
[1:20:29] they didn't come in with his breath all
[1:20:31] stinking and everything
[1:20:33] nah
[1:20:34] came in slick smooth
[1:20:36] nice and talkative
[1:20:38] amen
[1:20:39] trying to find amen your weakness
[1:20:42] trying to find eve's weakness
[1:20:45] trying to gather information so that he
[1:20:47] can
[1:20:49] at the appropriate time
[1:20:54] that's exactly what happened
[1:20:56] so so young young girls
[1:20:58] i i implore you
[1:21:03] you you're in a room with a guy
[1:21:06] it doesn't need to be
[1:21:08] if there's no other
[1:21:10] people in there there's no need for you
[1:21:12] to be in a room with a girl by with a
[1:21:14] guy by yourself
[1:21:17] especially guys that are not even
[1:21:19] christians
[1:21:23] don't even have the holy ghost
[1:21:26] but they'll talk to you smooth
[1:21:29] oh my
[1:21:30] god
[1:21:33] slick ricks
[1:21:35] what time we got
[1:21:38] i'm so i'm just taking my time because i
[1:21:40] know this is going to be a multiple part
[1:21:51] listen i'm a father
[1:21:53] i'm a husband
[1:21:55] i went that way
[1:21:57] i know what it's like
[1:21:59] some of you young people think that
[1:22:01] we're just idiots
[1:22:03] and that we never went through those
[1:22:05] stages in life
[1:22:06] and that we don't know what it feels
[1:22:08] like to to feel tempted and have those
[1:22:10] feelings and and and and things like
[1:22:13] that
[1:22:15] we know
[1:22:17] amen
[1:22:18] we know
[1:22:20] and
[1:22:23] and so i've got a duty to protect my
[1:22:26] girls
[1:22:28] just like any father does
[1:22:32] man god gave me those girls
[1:22:35] i will do anything in in in what i can
[1:22:38] to protect them
[1:22:40] whether they get mad or not
[1:22:42] but eventually
[1:22:44] it'll be for their own good
[1:22:46] i told i told my daughter one time i
[1:22:48] said bella one of the greatest
[1:22:50] privileges that i will ever have
[1:22:52] is to be able to walk you down that
[1:22:54] aisle
[1:22:55] amen
[1:22:57] amen amen
[1:23:02] i think that is the great one of the
[1:23:03] greatest privileges that a man can ever
[1:23:05] have for her for her for her
[1:23:08] for his daughter
[1:23:10] pure and undefiled from the world
[1:23:14] amen that's how it was at the beginning
[1:23:17] amen when adam was when he was put to
[1:23:20] sleep
[1:23:22] amen
[1:23:23] eve was brought to to to adam and who
[1:23:27] was holding her by the hand
[1:23:29] it was god the father
[1:23:31] and she was pure she was clean she was
[1:23:34] amen unadulterated
[1:23:37] amen
[1:23:39] and that is your purpose young girls
[1:23:42] that is your purpose right amen your
[1:23:44] purpose first and foremost is to serve
[1:23:46] god but then second of all amen is to be
[1:23:50] able to have the man that god gave you
[1:23:53] amen your husband
[1:23:56] and that man amen whoever it is amen
[1:23:58] then sneakily go by you know trying to
[1:24:01] text you or trying to email you amen
[1:24:03] amen he went through the right channels
[1:24:06] to get to be your husband
[1:24:10] that is the right way
[1:24:12] that is god's way
[1:24:13] and that will be a blessing
[1:24:16] it's a great blessing
[1:24:19] i promise you it's a great blessing
[1:24:22] a bender
[1:24:23] done that
[1:24:25] praise the lord
[1:24:30] so
[1:24:32] so we know that satan he introduced his
[1:24:34] thoughts to eve and we know that eve
[1:24:37] received those thoughts and you see
[1:24:39] that's the thing with young girls
[1:24:41] young girls they easily receive thoughts
[1:24:45] and that's why husbands fathers listen
[1:24:47] to me for just a moment it is so
[1:24:50] important for you to s either spend that
[1:24:53] quality time with your girls with your
[1:24:55] daughters
[1:24:56] let them know that you love them
[1:24:59] let them know how beautiful they are
[1:25:02] even go out on dates with them and
[1:25:04] things like that
[1:25:07] amen
[1:25:08] things that will keep them amen to let
[1:25:10] them know hey i'm loved by my father i'm
[1:25:13] protected by my father so whatever
[1:25:15] weasel comes around i know that if he
[1:25:17] doesn't act like my father i'm not gonna
[1:25:19] go boy
[1:25:31] that is your duty as a father
[1:25:35] i don't need to do that you know they'll
[1:25:37] get everything at the youth camp
[1:25:41] they'll get everything at church
[1:25:44] no
[1:25:45] you got to spend you've got to have time
[1:25:47] with them
[1:25:48] god didn't give you your children for
[1:25:50] just 50
[1:25:51] of you
[1:25:52] being you raising them 50 and then the
[1:25:55] world or whoever raises them the other
[1:25:57] 50 no
[1:25:58] it's a full-time job
[1:26:02] so it's you're the one who to answer
[1:26:06] man your children aren't gonna answers
[1:26:08] you're just gonna answer as the parent
[1:26:12] praise god
[1:26:15] so eve
[1:26:17] received these thoughts and our young
[1:26:19] girls they easily receive their thoughts
[1:26:21] why because they are fragile
[1:26:24] they are fragile
[1:26:26] especially in those ages listen there's
[1:26:28] nothing wrong with
[1:26:31] our young people wanting to have
[1:26:33] a relationship with the opposite sex
[1:26:37] there is nothing wrong with that god
[1:26:39] ordained it that way
[1:26:42] right
[1:26:45] there is nothing wrong with that
[1:26:48] but do it in the right way
[1:26:50] the right channels so that you can start
[1:26:53] it off right and what starts off right
[1:26:55] ends right
[1:26:57] amen
[1:26:59] praise god
[1:27:00] do it in the right way
[1:27:02] amen maybe you you may not be one that
[1:27:05] that's going to be married but god will
[1:27:07] put that in you that you won't want to
[1:27:10] be married
[1:27:11] there's nothing wrong with that
[1:27:13] they're sisters
[1:27:15] husband a man that have never been
[1:27:16] married before and they feel at peace
[1:27:19] with that paul said i wish that you were
[1:27:21] just like like him
[1:27:23] he was never married
[1:27:25] and he was the messenger of the age
[1:27:28] right
[1:27:31] but when you have that desire hey listen
