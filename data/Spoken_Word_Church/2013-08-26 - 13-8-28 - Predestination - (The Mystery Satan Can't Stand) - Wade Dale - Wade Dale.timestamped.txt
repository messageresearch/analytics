[16:27] one must take their time
[16:31] in a hurried pace
[16:33] there's often ways no sense of reason or
[16:39] wrong
[16:41] but when i think of my new life
[16:46] in my brand new home
[16:51] the first thing
[16:53] that comes to mind is my time at his
[16:58] throne
[17:00] but when it's my

[28:53] i don't know about you but i wouldn't
[28:55] want to be here if i didn't think he was
[28:58] here this morning
[28:59] jesus said where two or three are
[29:01] gathered in my name
[29:03] must have been talking about the end
[29:05] time because in some gatherings you
[29:06] don't get more than two or three
[29:08] but that's encouragement enough to me to
[29:11] know that
[29:12] that uh if there's only two there you
[29:14] know there's an unseen guest there's the
[29:16] third one there but it's not people who
[29:18] just gather
[29:20] because you've got denominational
[29:21] churches all over town and you know that
[29:23] the lord has not gathered how he knows
[29:24] that revelation 3 tells us he's on the
[29:27] outside knocking to get in so he ain't
[29:29] there
[29:30] so it's two or three that god has

[29:54] sister joe and said he's more known by
[29:55] sister jean's husband so
[29:58] so he does have a name and i believe
[29:59] it's brother wade so we're going to call
[30:01] him brother wade
[30:03] he's not a stranger to uh to wichita
[30:07] and we've always enjoyed his ministry
[30:09] and
[30:11] as i said i know the lord will have
[30:12] wonderful things for us today so let's
[30:14] enjoy the presence of the word
[30:16] the times of refreshing will do what
[30:19] come from the presence
[30:21] of the lord amen don't just come here to
[30:23] meet him we live
[30:25] in his presence but here's where he
[30:26] speaks to us so we'll just turn it over
[30:29] to our dear brother
[30:30] and give him the liberty to minister to
[30:33] us as the lord has put it on his heart
[30:36] brother wait god bless you my brother
[30:52] oh
[31:25] how about that oh lord have mercy
[31:29] could you not hear me anyway
[31:31] hey you didn't have to be so zealous of
[31:33] that you know you
[31:36] jeez
[31:37] what was i talking about how good y'all
[31:39] were and all that no forget it
[31:42] no good to be in the house of the lord
[31:43] good to be back among you good to be
[31:45] among the living really we're the only
[31:46] ones that do have life
[31:48] they just have a life that god permitted
[31:50] but this is a predestinated group of
[31:52] people
[31:53] and that's what we're going to talk
[31:54] about today is a little bit about
[31:56] predestination but we're going to kind
[31:57] of take it at an angle that maybe that
[32:00] i have not heard many people speak on
[32:02] and
[32:03] and take it in that in that order so
[32:06] i want to say that it's good to be here
[32:09] you all are my friends
[32:12] and you all are family not just friends
[32:15] we're family members we have a family
[32:17] gathering here
[32:18] i mean
[32:19] you got natural family out there
[32:22] but i'd rather be with a spiritual
[32:23] family
[32:24] even than the natural family so it's
[32:27] good to be in the house of the lord
[32:28] thank brother jim and
[32:30] sister regina for having us out
[32:32] uh wonderful man of god
[32:35] uh good friend and like i said a
[32:38] wonderful brother and brother tom and
[32:40] sister sandy for opening their home up
[32:42] and letting us stay there
[32:43] and and uh brother chad and sister
[32:46] christine they're just just wonderful
[32:48] people i don't want to call everybody's
[32:49] name because i'll miss somebody but but
[32:51] you all are special to me i think about
[32:53] you always
[32:54] and uh you come on my mind a lot
[32:57] uh every time i walk out to walked out
[33:00] the door chad's nasty shoes were
[33:01] standing out there that he left from
[33:03] from the fishing trip so that reminded
[33:05] me of him anyway
[33:07] nasty shoes
[33:09] and so we brought them back on a plane
[33:11] and they did confiscate them but they
[33:12] give it back to us and we were able to
[33:14] give them to him so so he has them now
[33:16] but
[33:17] it was horrible but anyway
[33:21] it's like a wet
[33:22] cow but let's turn our bibles if you
[33:25] will to the book of jeremiah
[33:28] and
[33:29] we will without any further ado like i
[33:32] said we love you with the love of the
[33:33] lord send you greetings from my dad out
[33:36] in
[33:37] lula georgia pastor samuel dale
[33:40] and
[33:41] we love him with the love of the lord
[33:43] also it's good to have a father in the
[33:44] gospel who's your natural father
[33:47] and i feel
[33:48] that god shined on something on me
[33:51] to let me have a real dad that's a real
[33:54] father you know
[33:55] and a father in the gospel that i can
[33:57] depend on and
[33:59] and
[33:59] be able to talk to him as a natural
[34:02] father and as a spiritual father so
[34:04] i just i thank god for that but thank
[34:06] each and every one of you for having us
[34:08] out
[34:09] we uh
[34:10] we sorry we didn't get out here in in uh
[34:13] in the main meetings but told brother
[34:15] jim we would be able to come maybe a
[34:16] little bit later on so we've been here a
[34:17] few days and
[34:19] flying out tomorrow about four so just
[34:21] keep us in your prayers and
[34:23] and like i said we we truly there's no
[34:26] words to express maybe when we get on
[34:27] the other side
[34:29] we'll be able to express
[34:30] more
[34:31] uh being in the finite world that we're
[34:33] in you can only say thank you and you
[34:35] say well does he really mean that or
[34:37] does he not mean that you know you can
[34:38] analyze all that but when we get over
[34:40] there
[34:41] there's not going to be any guesswork
[34:42] because if you made it and i made it we
[34:44] have the same mind
[34:46] and we have the mind of christ and we
[34:48] can understand each each and every one
[34:50] of us so the book of jeremiah
[34:52] we're going to speak today on
[34:54] it's really called the predestination
[34:56] the mystery satan can't stand but we're
[34:58] going to go a little bit
[35:00] uh different i was
[35:03] i
[35:04] ministered on this several years ago at
[35:06] the church and now dad's right in the
[35:07] middle of
[35:09] 10 or 12
[35:10] services on predestination but we're
[35:12] going to look at predestination
[35:14] by
[35:14] foreknowledge you don't hear a lot of
[35:17] about foreign knowledge
[35:18] you hear about predestination which is
[35:20] good but we're going to see where the
[35:21] prophet said that's really not a good
[35:22] word to use
[35:24] okay so we'll go by what he says
[35:27] and then see how god can
[35:29] can bring it alive in our hearts so
[35:30] let's borrow heads before we get started
[35:33] dear heavenly father we
[35:36] come today with
[35:38] a glad heart that we're among believers
[35:43] and that you're not somewhere else as
[35:45] brother jim said you're you're not out
[35:47] there in the other churches
[35:49] we believe we brought you here today
[35:52] as our little lick of fire comes
[35:54] together lord may it become that cloud
[35:56] that pillar of fire lord
[35:58] where you cannot only
[36:01] be a bystander to watch our actions and
[36:04] reactions but lord you can be an active
[36:06] participant in this service
[36:08] you can be the hearer you can be the
[36:10] speaker you can be the one that sees or
[36:13] understands what's going on
[36:16] just let the holy spirit
[36:18] have total preeminence in this service
[36:20] lord
[36:22] bless the pastor here lord the deacons
[36:24] and elders and all the ones that attend
[36:25] here lord that you'll ever keep them
[36:27] strong
[36:28] give them good service lord for your
[36:30] will
[36:31] father forgive us of our sins and our
[36:33] many mistakes lord clear our mind
[36:35] that we may be able to speak you lord
[36:38] bless this day if you're getting sick
[36:40] among us lord you said you sent the word
[36:41] and healed them and delivered them from
[36:44] their destruction so we pray lord as the
[36:46] word goes forth that you would heal
[36:48] that you would minister
[36:49] that you would lord not only heal the
[36:52] physically sick but lord even the
[36:54] spiritually sick
[36:55] maybe someone backslid today lord it's
[36:58] trying to get back to you father may
[37:00] this help them lord
[37:02] and realizing that
[37:04] if we were a part of god
[37:06] then we were there before the foundation
[37:08] of the world not his people
[37:10] but lord is an attribute
[37:12] we ask just be with us now and take care
[37:14] of us lead us in guide us by your holy
[37:15] spirit in jesus name
[37:17] amen all right let's read jeremiah 1
[37:19] verse 5.
[37:22] we're not going to do like they did back
[37:24] in the old testament where they stood
[37:25] for six hours
[37:27] so we'll have our seat in just a moment
[37:29] but you know what they found
[37:33] they found a word
[37:35] that had not been read
[37:37] right in the old testament
[37:39] and they were so zealous
[37:42] they stood for six hours
[37:45] while the priest just read
[37:48] this part that they had never heard
[37:49] before
[37:51] six hours
[37:52] and it's hard for us to stand a few
[37:54] minutes
[37:55] but listen to that dude no nobody fell
[37:57] asleep no
[37:59] no no they nobody fell asleep
[38:02] so jeremiah 1 verse 5.
[38:05] but i'm not going to make you stand for
[38:06] six hours okay
[38:08] before i formed thee in the belly i knew
[38:10] thee
[38:12] and before thou camest forth out of the
[38:14] womb i sanctified thee
[38:16] and i ordained thee a prophet
[38:18] unto the nations now let's go to romans
[38:21] 9
[38:22] verse 13.
[38:26] as it is written
[38:30] jacob have i loved and esau have i hated
[38:35] now let's read one more ephesians
[38:38] four
[38:40] they're going to have to
[38:42] bear with me back there i told the
[38:44] brother i said this is two sermons in
[38:46] one so
[38:48] i always think of double mint gum tom
[38:51] tom gets me all this carnal side you
[38:53] know two men you know you two remember
[38:55] the double mint two minutes two minutes
[38:56] well you're gonna get two sermons two
[38:58] sermons two sermons in one so just what
[39:00] you're going to get today ephesians 4
[39:03] i'm in ephesians 1 verse 4 through 11.
[39:07] sorry
[39:08] ephesians 1. because see i scribbled all
[39:10] these i've had the erase and x out and
[39:12] all that so according as he has chosen
[39:16] us
[39:18] and we spoke on this several several
[39:19] years ago here
[39:20] um
[39:21] i believe the ephesian church was
[39:23] somebody he could paul could feel
[39:25] comfortable with with teaching them the
[39:26] word of god because they were a strong
[39:29] church they were a church that was
[39:30] mature
[39:32] he could talk to these people all right
[39:34] this was not milk this was meat all
[39:36] right
[39:37] according as he had chosen us in him
[39:39] before the foundation of the world that
[39:41] we should be holy and without blame
[39:42] before him in love
[39:43] having predestinated us
[39:46] so we have a predestinated part
[39:50] that we got to come to
[39:51] according having predestinated us into
[39:54] the adoption of children by jesus christ
[39:56] to himself according to the good
[39:58] pleasure of his will and we're going to
[39:59] talk a little bit about that because you
[40:02] can't get into predestination without
[40:03] getting into permissive will and perfect
[40:05] well
[40:06] okay all right so here we go to the
[40:08] praise of the glory of his grace wherein
[40:10] he hath ex made us accepted
[40:13] in the beloved in whom we have
[40:14] redemption through the blood through his
[40:16] blood the forgiveness of sins according
[40:18] to the riches of his grace wherein he
[40:20] hath abounded toward us in all wisdom
[40:21] and prudence having made known unto us
[40:25] the mystery of his will according to his
[40:28] good pleasure which he had purposed
[40:30] in himself
[40:31] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[40:33] of times
[40:35] times
[40:36] last 2000 years he might gather together
[40:38] one all things in christ which are in
[40:40] heaven which are on earth even in him
[40:43] in whom also we have obtained an
[40:45] inheritance
[40:47] being predestinated according to the
[40:49] purpose of him who worketh all things
[40:52] after the council
[40:54] of his own will
[40:56] and brother brown said his will is his
[40:59] word
[41:00] all right so it's according to the
[41:01] counsel of his word so the the bible
[41:05] is the will of god
[41:07] all right so you can be seated in the
[41:08] lord add his blessing to the
[41:10] to the reading of the word as we get
[41:12] into this
[41:14] i i really when i title this it's a
[41:16] mystery satan can't stand because
[41:19] he can't of course he can't stand the
[41:20] word period
[41:23] but he can't stand something he can't
[41:26] get to
[41:28] and if you're predestinated in god today
[41:31] there's a part that god that satan can't
[41:33] get to
[41:35] he can't get to you
[41:36] and the devil
[41:38] can't understand that or he'd be your
[41:40] brother brother brown said if he could
[41:42] get if he could get a revelation
[41:45] right he would become your brothers but
[41:47] he so he's locked out of that
[41:49] that god has predestinated a group of
[41:52] people
[41:53] but now remember i want you to remember
[41:55] these two things number one
[41:57] predestinated
[41:59] is the promise he predestinated a group
[42:02] of people
[42:05] all right
[42:07] but now r predestination is the journey
[42:10] that we take because predestination is
[42:12] what
[42:14] destiny determined
[42:18] beforehand
[42:19] jacob have i love he saw have i hated
[42:21] all right so it's destiny
[42:24] determined
[42:25] beforehand now look if we're going to
[42:28] read some quotes but if god if we take
[42:30] that just by that
[42:34] then god's a respecter of persons
[42:39] if we take it just as that
[42:41] god's a respecter of persons and he's
[42:43] not there's no way he can bring me on
[42:46] this earth
[42:47] a different way than he brought adolf
[42:48] hitler on this earth or
[42:51] he's going to have to give adolf hitler
[42:52] the same thing he gives me
[42:55] everybody understand that say
[42:56] amen so god is not a respecter of
[42:59] persons we were all born in sin
[43:02] all shaping in iniquity william branham
[43:05] include dead
[43:07] come to this world speaking lies doomed
[43:09] and on our way to hell the prophet said
[43:11] so where there's none of us are
[43:13] are the good ones and then the bad ones
[43:17] because
[43:18] in god we were all born the same way
[43:21] right
[43:22] so we can't glory
[43:24] only that we were predestinated but look
[43:27] you've got predestinated
[43:30] but there's a journey to get to there
[43:33] everybody got that there's a journey to
[43:36] get to that spot
[43:38] so in other words god said i'm gonna
[43:39] have a bride
[43:42] now he knows who it is
[43:45] now look this is not for god's purpose
[43:47] today
[43:49] we're not preaching to god
[43:51] we're not god's all-knowing he he knew
[43:54] this before he ever created it so we're
[43:56] not telling him something but we are the
[43:58] ones
[44:00] through this conduit of of of man
[44:03] he's trying to get you to see
[44:06] that you were predestinated and there is
[44:08] a bride that's going to be
[44:11] on the earth at the time of a rapture
[44:15] but now you've got to determine whether
[44:17] you're part of that group or not
[44:21] he didn't or he's a respecter of persons
[44:26] did everybody understand that
[44:28] because it's like brother adam said
[44:30] we'll read it god you can't
[44:32] put it so close to where god put you in
[44:34] a tube
[44:37] and said this is the way rory is going
[44:38] to be
[44:40] that's a respect to a person
[44:45] that's predestination that's why brother
[44:46] brown said predestination is not a good
[44:49] word to say in a group of people because
[44:51] it is it's destiny
[44:53] determined beforehand written in a book
[44:56] right here
[45:00] but now sister lonnie's name's not in
[45:01] this book physically
[45:05] but if sister lonnie connects somewhere
[45:07] with the word
[45:09] she came by permissive well
[45:12] this is his perfect will we were not
[45:14] supposed to be born the way we're born
[45:17] that's permissive
[45:18] the perfect will of god was spoken
[45:20] children spoken word children which is
[45:22] happening now
[45:24] so we're going back to that
[45:27] right
[45:28] but listen to what brother brown said
[45:30] let's pull the the first quote up we're
[45:32] talking now a little bit about i want
[45:34] you to see something about perfect will
[45:36] and permissive will
[45:38] because that's what we live under
[45:43] you know brother branham said one time
[45:44] he said the holy ghost we've been
[45:45] talking about this in sunday school
[45:47] class the holy ghost is very timid the
[45:49] holy ghost is a gentleman the holy ghost
[45:50] will go out on a limb
[45:52] not that you'll not not that you've got
[45:54] the holy ghost and he's going to leave
[45:56] you and go sit somewhere no
[45:59] you
[46:01] you
[46:03] are a free moral agent
[46:06] even after you're born again you say oh
[46:08] we have no rights that's right we don't
[46:10] have any right we don't have any new
[46:12] thought coming we don't have any of that
[46:14] but as human beings we do
[46:17] i've been teaching on the statue of a
[46:18] perfect man brother brown preached doors
[46:20] indoors
[46:21] after god gets in your house
[46:25] after you let him in come on now that's
[46:28] what brother brown was talking about he
[46:29] wasn't just talking about
[46:31] like you said
[46:33] let me in let me in i'm at the front of
[46:34] your door no after we let him in there's
[46:38] a kitchen door
[46:40] there's a living room door
[46:42] there's a bedroom door
[46:45] and we
[46:46] keep that closed
[46:48] and when brother brandon made that
[46:49] statement he said the holy ghost is a
[46:50] gentleman well that's exactly what it is
[46:52] because god's not going to walk in your
[46:54] house and go let me in that room right
[46:56] there let me in that room no
[47:00] by your free will you allow him to go
[47:02] into that virtue
[47:04] knowledge temperance
[47:06] patience godliness that is all
[47:10] determined by you
[47:12] but now god's got a predestinated group
[47:14] that that's going to happen too
[47:17] what i call a spot
[47:19] there's a spot that we've got to get to
[47:22] because we fell from that spot
[47:25] and we got to get back to that spot
[47:28] okay right we fell from something
[47:31] and we're not going back to something
[47:33] different
[47:35] we're going back to where we fell from
[47:37] all right
[47:38] so in predestination but watch what when
[47:41] we come down here
[47:42] and keep that in mind destiny determined
[47:46] beforehand
[47:48] but you can't just stay on
[47:50] predestination we've got to bring in the
[47:53] word for knowledge
[47:55] okay because the word for knowledge is
[47:57] first
[47:59] we'll read it those he ford knew he did
[48:02] predestinate
[48:03] predestination wasn't first
[48:07] or he did predetermine and pull you
[48:09] through a tube and say this is the only
[48:11] way you can go
[48:13] but we still have those doors
[48:15] we still
[48:16] we bind the holy spirit brother brown
[48:18] said the holy spirit's been bound for
[48:19] two thousand years at the door of what
[48:23] creeds and dogmas that's not
[48:25] out there that's mine and yours
[48:28] he's not worried about their creed he
[48:30] knows it's wrong
[48:32] he's worried about the creeds and dogmas
[48:34] that you and i bring up
[48:37] oh i don't have any
[48:41] here you come preach
[48:44] because i have plenty
[48:46] of creeds that i bring up of my own and
[48:48] dogmas and that's what god's trying to
[48:50] do he's trying to kill that old husband
[48:53] that old nature
[48:56] give us virtue knowledge because it's a
[48:57] statue of a perfect man
[49:00] all right but let's not get on to that i
[49:01] don't want to lean on to that let's stay
[49:03] back into predestination let's look at
[49:05] quote number one does god change his
[49:06] mind about his word
[49:08] brother brown said
[49:10] but where he but told him he's talking
[49:12] to moses now watch moses he's talking to
[49:15] moses he said moses in other words but
[49:17] you're not going over you took my
[49:19] permissive will
[49:21] down here at the rock
[49:24] you glorified yourself and not me
[49:29] but now watch
[49:31] you sanctified yourself
[49:34] you didn't sanctify me
[49:36] isn't this me and you
[49:38] you didn't keep my original word what i
[49:41] told you to do
[49:42] yet the water did come
[49:47] yet the water did come
[49:49] he honored that prophet in permissive
[49:51] will
[49:53] and saved a group of people
[49:56] remember brother branham when he was
[49:57] going to or was it africa i believe it
[49:59] was and the lord told him not to go that
[50:00] way but remember the will of the
[50:02] ministers
[50:05] he said i'll go with you but we're going
[50:07] to have problems remember he drew a line
[50:09] and said we're going to have problems
[50:10] from here on well you know
[50:12] it wasn't that brother branham went and
[50:14] preached to the people though and nobody
[50:15] got saved and nobody got healed no he
[50:17] had a he had a successful campaign he
[50:20] paid for it because he made that choice
[50:23] remember he paid for that okay
[50:27] kind of a bad place to be a minister
[50:29] everybody wants to be a preacher and a
[50:31] and uh a pastor
[50:34] you better run from it
[50:37] because it's a it's a it's a
[50:38] responsibility
[50:41] you can lay hands on the sick and they
[50:43] recover you can prophesy or speak with
[50:45] tongues but the thing is keep his
[50:46] original word
[50:48] god don't change his mind friend you've
[50:51] got to keep his commission
[50:53] his will and that's where
[50:56] i fall
[50:58] i don't do what the word says
[51:03] if we come to a place where we all going
[51:05] to do what the word says all the time no
[51:07] we're still this is still permissive
[51:08] will
[51:09] this is going to be sticky i think i
[51:11] have a quote this is going to be sticky
[51:12] until the change
[51:14] so let's don't look at
[51:16] see then you look at predestination to
[51:18] where well i'm perfect
[51:20] i don't do anything wrong
[51:22] i'm god's predestinated me i'm signed
[51:25] sealed delivered locked in packed up and
[51:27] ready to go up
[51:30] by his fore knowledge he may have saw
[51:32] that but you haven't seen that yet
[51:35] right
[51:36] we're all getting older we can't think
[51:38] like we used to we can't work like we
[51:41] used to
[51:42] and that's perfect will of god no we
[51:45] never came the perfect way
[51:48] nobody except jesus
[51:51] nobody came the perfect way so we're all
[51:54] in the same level the same boat
[51:57] adolf hitler included
[51:59] eichmann all those people that you want
[52:01] to be you know you say well they're
[52:02] horrible you know what i believe
[52:04] hitler's mama said oh sweet little baby
[52:07] this is beautiful he's a wonderful child
[52:09] i'm going to train him up maybe he'll be
[52:11] a preacher one day but you know what one
[52:13] day he was just like judas brother brown
[52:15] said if judas would have went to
[52:16] pentecost
[52:18] right if judas would have went to
[52:20] pentecost but he didn't what he made a
[52:21] choice
[52:24] became the son of perdition
[52:27] same way with hitler hitler and all
[52:29] those they had a choice
[52:30] somewhere they're going to have to stand
[52:32] before god and they're going to say
[52:34] god i i become this because of some
[52:36] spirit that got on me and god's going to
[52:38] say i'm going to tell you the day it
[52:40] went on you
[52:41] and i'm going to tell you the day that i
[52:42] tried to get it off of you
[52:44] and i'm going to tell you the day that i
[52:46] sent a preacher by one day
[52:50] there's the judge
[52:52] he's going to judge them and say hitler
[52:54] i will come to you
[52:55] on this day and you refused me
[52:59] if he doesn't do that then he is a
[53:00] respecter or person
[53:03] he is
[53:04] he's not though he's not that way he's
[53:06] going to come to you say well there's 7
[53:08] billion people in the world well so what
[53:11] god made him everyone
[53:13] so he can judge them all
[53:15] i mean
[53:16] sometimes we we limit god to a way to
[53:19] where he's like us he's not
[53:22] he's infinite
[53:24] we're going to get into something in a
[53:25] minute i want to see if you believe it
[53:26] or not
[53:28] you know how i like to like get you to
[53:29] think
[53:32] but god's so infinite
[53:36] we're going to prove this by foreign
[53:37] knowledge in a few minutes god is so
[53:39] infinite now see that infinite means all
[53:42] knowing
[53:44] brother sam he would know if you married
[53:46] someone else how your life would be
[53:53] if not he's finite
[53:57] like we were talking about yesterday
[54:00] we go with this certain girl
[54:02] and we think she's the love of her life
[54:05] she's beautiful
[54:08] i'm gonna marry that girl and then
[54:10] something happens
[54:13] if we believe that the hand of god is on
[54:16] us it's for a purpose
[54:19] but you can press your way in but if
[54:20] you'll pray
[54:22] pray before god
[54:24] young kids
[54:26] pray before god before you marry
[54:27] somebody
[54:28] because you might you might marry the
[54:30] wrong one god's not going to give you
[54:32] the wrong one but you may marry the
[54:33] wrong one
[54:37] come on now that's infinite god and he
[54:39] would know like my dad always says he he
[54:41] went out with this girl
[54:43] and and he went with this girl and she
[54:44] was a real nice sweet girl and and you
[54:47] know and he he thought maybe she would
[54:49] be the one
[54:51] well she wasn't my mom come on the scene
[54:55] well see i wouldn't have got here
[54:57] i would have got here a different way
[54:59] but if he would have married her her
[55:02] husband is a methodist preacher
[55:04] well see dad would have been in that
[55:06] line going in that direction toward the
[55:08] methodist being a methodist preacher
[55:11] so you see that god is infinite so i
[55:13] want you to see that that it's not that
[55:15] god would know what you were if you had
[55:17] never said
[55:19] yes to the message or that's the only
[55:21] way i can see
[55:22] how that god can say adolf hitler
[55:26] you're going to live in a certain time
[55:28] you're going to do all these hideous
[55:29] things and you're going to commit
[55:30] suicide
[55:31] he knew that right
[55:33] but he knew in his infinite mind he knew
[55:37] that if he gave adolf hitler a million
[55:39] years
[55:41] adolf hitler would never come to
[55:43] repentance
[55:44] now that i've got to believe
[55:48] but now you
[55:49] you have a choice to make just like he
[55:50] did but he knew his infinite mind knows
[55:53] that if he give all these people out in
[55:55] this world
[55:56] live a thousand years each
[55:59] live ten thousand years each
[56:01] they would never come to a place of
[56:03] repentance well see that way i can see
[56:05] how that god can be the judge
[56:08] he can judge them that way because he
[56:10] said you never accepted me here you turn
[56:12] me down
[56:13] all right so let's read the rest of this
[56:15] let's read the rest of this quote let's
[56:16] go to seed it's not air with the show
[56:20] now we see from what i said last night
[56:22] any move from that original plan of god
[56:24] throws the whole thing out of cater
[56:26] we can't move from that original word we
[56:28] talked on it last evening or evening
[56:30] last about balaam we'll see balaam's a
[56:32] perfect example
[56:35] hey this guy was a false prophet
[56:37] he got an audience with god
[56:40] several times
[56:42] remember and he wanted
[56:44] he wanted to
[56:46] curse israel
[56:48] and god wouldn't let him
[56:51] but in his mind in his human mind he
[56:53] wanted to curse israel but he couldn't
[56:54] he said i'm going to do what god said
[56:56] but remember you see what he did in his
[56:58] permissive will he kept pressing
[57:01] satan comes on the scene and says okay
[57:03] let's just get him to intermingle said
[57:04] we'll not destroy him here we'll just
[57:06] destroy him by letting him married and
[57:08] intermarry so see he got his way but it
[57:11] wasn't the right way but brother brown
[57:13] says look he got god's answer straight
[57:16] and clear don't go but he has a
[57:19] permissive will and you can work in that
[57:22] if you wish to
[57:24] and god will make it honoring
[57:28] but still it's not god's perfect will
[57:31] and that's what we should strive for his
[57:33] perfect will not his permissive will the
[57:36] kingdom of god which is in the earth
[57:38] today can never be set up justly on a
[57:41] permissive will
[57:43] so we can't strive that's why we don't
[57:45] pray for the united states of america we
[57:46] don't pay for the gut pray for the
[57:48] government and all those things that's
[57:50] all permissive
[57:52] we got to get to the perfect will of god
[57:54] which is which is the bride that has to
[57:56] come to rapturing faith that's what that
[57:58] should be our
[58:00] our goal and that should be our the
[58:02] whole function of our life sure we have
[58:04] life to live when we have things we're
[58:05] talking about backstage backstairs and
[58:07] uh
[58:08] we're life i love life and i you know we
[58:10] we don't sit in the closet
[58:14] we enjoy life but we don't let it
[58:16] overtake
[58:18] we don't let it overtake what we are
[58:22] you love the world things of the world
[58:23] the love of god's not in you
[58:25] but that love means just actually love
[58:27] it more than you love god
[58:30] and god will not allow that
[58:32] you can never be set up justly the
[58:34] kingdom on permissive will it's got to
[58:37] come back
[58:38] to his perfect will and it will amen
[58:42] all right let's look
[58:45] so now
[58:46] perfect will
[58:49] and permissive will
[58:50] and there's another thing called
[58:52] election
[58:53] all right i've always said election is
[58:55] very simple to me
[58:57] god voted for you the devil voted
[58:59] against you
[59:00] you swing the vote
[59:05] one more time for those of you that are
[59:07] asleep
[59:08] god
[59:10] god voted for you
[59:12] it's not that you're asleep over here
[59:13] they are i'm just leaving them alone
[59:16] then
[59:18] god voted for you
[59:20] the devil voted against you because he's
[59:22] got that vote against you
[59:24] but you swing the vote
[59:27] because it's going to be two to one one
[59:28] way or the other okay so there it goes
[59:31] back to choice again
[59:32] it's all in free moral agency it's uh
[59:35] you know
[59:36] god made a choice
[59:41] god is a free moral agent
[59:44] he doesn't need us to exist
[59:48] does he
[59:49] he does not need us to exist he chose
[59:54] he chose
[59:56] to have sons and daughters of god
[59:59] he had attributes that had to come out
[1:00:01] so he chose to be a father
[1:00:04] he chose to be a son he didn't have to
[1:00:06] come down here what law says he had to
[1:00:08] come down here
[1:00:10] none he could just let us just
[1:00:12] actually he just could say and we'd be
[1:00:14] gone and he'd just create another one
[1:00:17] but he didn't brother brown said in
[1:00:18] christ the mystery of god are real he
[1:00:19] had a plan
[1:00:22] and a purpose
[1:00:25] wow a plan god sat down and had a plan
[1:00:29] and a purpose and it's not like me and
[1:00:31] you making one
[1:00:35] his comes out right every time
[1:00:38] we hit miss a little while
[1:00:40] every once in a while but remember these
[1:00:43] two things and it'll kind of help you
[1:00:45] with the permissive and perfect will
[1:00:49] now the perfect will
[1:00:53] is that god saw it happen
[1:00:55] because it is a perfect will of god he
[1:00:57] saw he saw it happen he can't change
[1:01:00] that way
[1:01:02] this bible was written before the
[1:01:03] foundation of the world he couldn't
[1:01:05] write it any different
[1:01:07] when we got down here and physically
[1:01:09] wrote it he couldn't change his mind
[1:01:11] okay so the perfect will of god is his
[1:01:14] word and that's what he saw and that's
[1:01:15] what's going to happen
[1:01:18] now permissive will
[1:01:22] god let it happen
[1:01:26] see the difference
[1:01:28] perfect will is it's going to happen
[1:01:31] that's why predestinated is the promise
[1:01:33] when god made a promise he's not going
[1:01:36] to change it but the journey is the
[1:01:39] predestination destiny determined
[1:01:42] beforehand a destiny a journey a life
[1:01:47] so the permissive will of god
[1:01:49] he let it happen but he let it happen by
[1:01:51] one thing
[1:01:53] choice
[1:01:55] all goes back to choice
[1:01:56] but you say well brother wayne everybody
[1:01:58] preaches on predestination this and
[1:02:00] we're we're a predestinated seed and
[1:02:02] we're predestinated this
[1:02:05] only in god
[1:02:07] only in christ
[1:02:09] are we a predestinated save
[1:02:11] remember remember what brother brown
[1:02:14] said in the church age book he said it's
[1:02:15] not the person
[1:02:16] that comes predestinated eternally from
[1:02:18] god
[1:02:19] but the seed or word
[1:02:21] this
[1:02:23] you weren't back there as little people
[1:02:25] running around in eternity
[1:02:27] they asked brother brown one time said
[1:02:29] what were we he said nothing
[1:02:31] and when a prophet says nothing he meant
[1:02:34] nothing
[1:02:36] even though he didn't say nothing
[1:02:38] he said nothing
[1:02:40] hallelujah he was a southerner
[1:02:44] so was paul
[1:02:46] that's the god and father of our lord
[1:02:47] jesus christ bless you all
[1:02:54] i'll say hallelujah again
[1:03:00] but
[1:03:00] listen so that permissive will was
[1:03:04] allowed of god
[1:03:06] because that's what brother brown said
[1:03:08] god allowed moses
[1:03:11] to do what he did
[1:03:13] and he backed him up by the water coming
[1:03:16] forth
[1:03:17] that's why you and i can work in the
[1:03:19] permissive will of god and remember he
[1:03:21] said and god will allow it
[1:03:23] and god will honor it hey listen we were
[1:03:25] born in permissive will
[1:03:27] we weren't supposed to be born by sex we
[1:03:29] were supposed to come
[1:03:30] sister lonnie sister brother sister bro
[1:03:33] we're supposed to come
[1:03:34] by the spoken word of god adam and eve
[1:03:39] but this is all permissive so this all
[1:03:41] permissive has got to go away to go back
[1:03:44] to his perfect will but the permissive
[1:03:47] had to be allowed to get us here
[1:03:50] after the fall
[1:03:52] this permissive will is now what god
[1:03:54] works in
[1:03:56] and sometimes we we you know we wonder
[1:04:00] god why
[1:04:01] um
[1:04:02] somebody dies suddenly somebody this i
[1:04:04] mean you wonder why you just don't know
[1:04:07] uh the only thing i can say is that i've
[1:04:10] always said this god's nose are the best
[1:04:13] yeses you'll ever get you've heard me
[1:04:14] say that before i'm gonna say it one
[1:04:16] more time for those of you that are
[1:04:17] asleep
[1:04:18] god's nose
[1:04:20] when god says no and you're praying
[1:04:21] about something and you know you come up
[1:04:22] to a place and it looks like you're
[1:04:25] many has done that
[1:04:27] i mean come right up to a wall you're
[1:04:29] like god this is what i want to do this
[1:04:31] looks perfect everything fits just fine
[1:04:38] that's god telling you no
[1:04:40] because he knows if he says yes and you
[1:04:42] continue down that road you're going to
[1:04:44] be worse
[1:04:46] hezekiah
[1:04:47] prime example
[1:04:49] right hezekiah you're going to die he
[1:04:52] sends a prophet to hezekiah and says
[1:04:53] hezekiah you're done
[1:04:56] you're finished
[1:04:58] get your stuff in order you're going to
[1:04:59] die thus saith
[1:05:01] the lord
[1:05:02] now watch his perfect will and his
[1:05:04] permissive will so hezekiah so he goes
[1:05:06] out hezekiah first thing he does he gets
[1:05:07] on his face and he says god
[1:05:09] i need more time
[1:05:12] but look what happened in hezekiah's
[1:05:13] life in that 15 years
[1:05:16] wasn't very good
[1:05:18] right
[1:05:19] he should have went ahead and died when
[1:05:20] he did there wouldn't have been a lot of
[1:05:21] this other things written about him
[1:05:24] so he he he he asked god and god allowed
[1:05:27] that
[1:05:28] prophet had to walk back in and say okay
[1:05:30] you got 15 more years or you're not
[1:05:31] going to die
[1:05:33] same way with god with you and i the
[1:05:34] permissive will of god we have to watch
[1:05:36] it
[1:05:37] we have to watch what we do
[1:05:40] because remember
[1:05:43] god's not going to make you do anything
[1:05:47] like we go back to the holy ghost even a
[1:05:48] born-again christian i'm talking about
[1:05:49] born in a christian
[1:05:51] born again christian he's not going to
[1:05:52] make you come to church
[1:05:55] but if the one that wrote it
[1:05:58] that forsake not assembling itself
[1:06:00] together if the one that wrote it is in
[1:06:02] you
[1:06:03] that part will connect we're going to
[1:06:05] get into that at the end of the sermon
[1:06:07] because that's what it's got to come
[1:06:08] back to it's got to come back to you
[1:06:10] seeing that this is what's in you
[1:06:14] there's the connection then i can say i
[1:06:16] am predestinated stamped sealed and
[1:06:19] delivered because that's the promise of
[1:06:21] god that somebody's going to do it
[1:06:25] you've just got to make sure
[1:06:28] that you decide
[1:06:30] you're the one that's going to do it
[1:06:34] like my old football coach said i've
[1:06:35] told you before lead follow or get out
[1:06:37] of the way
[1:06:39] i mean that's just that leave follow get
[1:06:41] out of the way don't hinder anybody
[1:06:43] i've always said that lord don't let me
[1:06:45] hinder people
[1:06:47] and my life probably does
[1:06:50] i say my life not my wife
[1:06:53] my life probably does
[1:06:56] but i want that to go away i want that
[1:06:58] permissive will to work to the perfect
[1:07:00] will of god
[1:07:01] see there brother chad i didn't throw
[1:07:02] you under the bus i got my wife this
[1:07:04] time
[1:07:07] you're well
[1:07:09] that hundred dollars helped
[1:07:16] y'all are just family we're talking
[1:07:17] family here we're just talking family
[1:07:19] it's just family a little family
[1:07:21] discussion
[1:07:22] but look
[1:07:24] he didn't make esau do anything
[1:07:27] but before there was a bible even
[1:07:29] written
[1:07:30] he knew when esau got here
[1:07:33] what he would do
[1:07:35] now that
[1:07:36] is foreknowledge
[1:07:38] so now we're going to raise it up a
[1:07:40] little bit
[1:07:41] and we're going to talk about the word
[1:07:43] for knowledge
[1:07:45] now the word for knowledge is very
[1:07:47] simple
[1:07:50] knowing beforehand
[1:07:52] knowledge
[1:07:53] beforehand
[1:07:55] for knowledge
[1:07:56] all right because
[1:08:00] excuse me
[1:08:01] for whom he did for new
[1:08:04] he also did predestinate
[1:08:08] so everybody wants to key on
[1:08:09] predestination and predestinated
[1:08:12] let's look at foreknowledge because
[1:08:13] that's where it all begins
[1:08:16] it begins in four knowledge because you
[1:08:18] can't have predestination without having
[1:08:20] foreknowledge
[1:08:22] oh i'm glad you're listening i don't see
[1:08:24] too many here too many demands you're
[1:08:25] either asleep or bored or
[1:08:27] we're not hungry yet
[1:08:30] processing that's good that's what i
[1:08:32] want you to do process
[1:08:34] listen let's go then let's let the
[1:08:36] prophet tell us then
[1:08:39] faith of abraham number two quote guys
[1:08:45] you know i want to say something here
[1:08:47] that that i don't say in many places
[1:08:50] but you've probably got one of the best
[1:08:51] support groups i've ever seen
[1:08:56] as far as your pastor with your deacons
[1:08:59] and with your elders and with your
[1:09:01] trustees with the brothers that do the
[1:09:03] work back in the back and i'm not giving
[1:09:04] glory to nobody i'm giving glory to god
[1:09:07] not one person but it does come from one
[1:09:10] man
[1:09:10] but i i just it's a it's a unit and it
[1:09:13] works
[1:09:15] and i'm not trying to build you up to
[1:09:17] like me
[1:09:19] i really don't care whether you like me
[1:09:20] or not
[1:09:22] because i know you do
[1:09:24] tell i'm sister jim's husband
[1:09:29] but you do you just and i i love being
[1:09:31] around you honestly i do i love being
[1:09:33] around you and i'd say this if i was
[1:09:35] somewhere else but i don't say that a
[1:09:36] lot of places
[1:09:38] but but you have you got a support group
[1:09:40] that's that's just
[1:09:41] second to none it's just in it you know
[1:09:44] what it does it makes me feel secure
[1:09:47] makes me feel secure you say well you
[1:09:48] don't even go to this church well yeah i
[1:09:49] do
[1:09:51] yeah i do
[1:09:53] i'll come here every time you do
[1:09:56] same holy ghost i gots here
[1:10:00] okay and i'm not saying that to glorify
[1:10:02] anybody i'm just telling you that it you
[1:10:04] should and you should pray for that and
[1:10:06] you should pray for the stability
[1:10:09] because we have a good support group in
[1:10:10] our church too and it's people working
[1:10:12] together and it it's like brother brown
[1:10:14] said don't be an organization but he
[1:10:15] said you can be an organism
[1:10:18] you can be annoying that's what this is
[1:10:19] it's an organism it works
[1:10:22] okay it works in the body of christ and
[1:10:24] i just i just feel
[1:10:26] it's a security blanket to me to know
[1:10:27] that someone is
[1:10:28] is is like-minded like my dad like
[1:10:31] brother like brother jim back here and
[1:10:33] and it's just
[1:10:34] and it's a testimony to all of you not
[1:10:37] just one person it's testimony to every
[1:10:38] one of you bringing it together
[1:10:41] and you know being an organism and it's
[1:10:43] wonderful so let's go back to here i
[1:10:44] just want to say that but i love
[1:10:46] everyone with love and lord faith of
[1:10:47] abraham
[1:10:49] number two got it
[1:10:51] and predestination is a hard word among
[1:10:54] a congregation of people because
[1:10:56] predestination really for knowledge is a
[1:10:59] better word
[1:11:01] now let's preach on four knowledge if
[1:11:03] foreign is a better word let's preach on
[1:11:05] four knowledge let's let's not forget
[1:11:06] predestination
[1:11:08] are predestinated
[1:11:09] but let's look at foreign knowledge
[1:11:13] that's what he said
[1:11:14] really foreknowledge is a better word
[1:11:16] and predestination looks back to
[1:11:18] foreknowledge
[1:11:20] god can't have foreknowledge without i
[1:11:22] mean can't have predestination without
[1:11:23] having four knowledge first
[1:11:26] those he foreknew
[1:11:31] he did predestinate
[1:11:34] not that god predestinated and that's it
[1:11:37] in a
[1:11:38] box like we're going to read in a minute
[1:11:41] brother ram says god didn't put you in a
[1:11:42] tube and pull you through it
[1:11:44] no he foreign knew
[1:11:49] what you would do when you got here
[1:11:52] your desires remember god doesn't even
[1:11:54] predestination by his desires
[1:12:00] he desired that everybody be saved
[1:12:04] god in his infinite mind does not want
[1:12:07] one person lost
[1:12:11] he's that kind of a god
[1:12:13] but he knows
[1:12:15] there's going to be a group and he knows
[1:12:17] he has to be a judge so that attribute
[1:12:19] is in him
[1:12:20] to be a judge so he has to have
[1:12:21] something to judge
[1:12:23] okay
[1:12:24] so god didn't even predestinate remember
[1:12:27] the prophecy
[1:12:29] that god predestinates by your desires
[1:12:32] right
[1:12:33] by your own desires god predestinate why
[1:12:36] he foreknew
[1:12:39] what you would do
[1:12:42] not
[1:12:44] make you do it
[1:12:47] everybody got me now
[1:12:49] foreknowledge is first
[1:12:52] then predestination can come into view
[1:12:54] so those he foreknew
[1:12:56] he did predestinate and so yes sir
[1:12:59] absolutely he knew jim pinkton would
[1:13:01] come on the earth and all the life that
[1:13:03] he would live but he knew he would
[1:13:05] come right here
[1:13:08] redemption
[1:13:10] but he knew maybe his partner in in
[1:13:12] school that was a roommate that that was
[1:13:14] close to him
[1:13:16] took a different path
[1:13:18] never would come to god if god gave him
[1:13:20] a million years he was always going to
[1:13:21] go in that direction
[1:13:25] everybody see that now
[1:13:27] all right let's continue to reading
[1:13:30] really for knowledge is a better word
[1:13:32] and predestination looks back to
[1:13:33] foreknowledge
[1:13:35] foreknowledge looks to destiny
[1:13:39] i'm going to explain
[1:13:40] foreknowledge
[1:13:42] looks to destiny because he already
[1:13:45] foreign knew what you were going to do
[1:13:46] so he can look down through time
[1:13:49] see what you're know what he knows what
[1:13:51] you're going to do he don't think what
[1:13:53] you're going to do
[1:13:54] he knows what you're going to do so
[1:13:56] therefore he can set your destiny
[1:14:00] but not by him making the choice
[1:14:05] or you do away before knowledge
[1:14:08] everybody got that
[1:14:10] so it's not that god pulled you through
[1:14:12] a tube but he saw your destiny
[1:14:17] beforehand
[1:14:19] so that's predestination so if you can
[1:14:21] say predestination and then look at
[1:14:24] foreknowledge i'm okay with it
[1:14:26] but not just that i'm this predestinated
[1:14:28] seed it doesn't matter what i do i can
[1:14:30] do what i want to that's what the people
[1:14:32] the the millennium people are preaching
[1:14:35] we're already in the millennium
[1:14:37] take them to a zoo
[1:14:41] put them in with the lines
[1:14:43] you'll find out real quick you're not in
[1:14:45] a millennium
[1:14:46] because we're supposed to
[1:14:49] yeah anyway
[1:14:51] kind of stupid but anyway
[1:14:55] that god being infinite in the beginning
[1:14:58] knew the end from the beginning
[1:15:00] therefore he knew what people would do
[1:15:02] i'm reading a quote
[1:15:04] so he could foretell
[1:15:09] jacob have i loved
[1:15:11] he saw have i hated jeremiah before you
[1:15:13] were formed in your womb
[1:15:14] see so so what brother branham was doing
[1:15:17] in an unlearned group of people if you
[1:15:19] just preach predestination
[1:15:22] as destiny determined beforehand then
[1:15:24] that means you haven't got anything to
[1:15:25] do with it
[1:15:27] that's why he said don't use
[1:15:28] predestination but now foreign knowledge
[1:15:31] god knowing what you would do
[1:15:35] he set your
[1:15:36] destiny because predestination is in the
[1:15:39] bible so we got to use it
[1:15:41] so it's not a bad word brother brown
[1:15:43] says here it's a bad word but later on
[1:15:45] he's going to say it's not so bad a word
[1:15:49] all right let's keep
[1:15:50] reading excuse me faith of abraham let's
[1:15:53] read the
[1:15:55] e 20 paragraph therefore he by election
[1:15:58] he chose abraham for he knew
[1:16:00] for he knew what abraham would do
[1:16:05] i believe god called many people besides
[1:16:07] abraham
[1:16:10] i believe god called
[1:16:12] people beside elijah
[1:16:14] i think he called people beside isaiah
[1:16:17] he called people beside noah
[1:16:20] if not he's a respecter of persons
[1:16:24] i believe he called people
[1:16:26] but they didn't respond
[1:16:28] abraham was the only one that responded
[1:16:32] so god in his infinite mind
[1:16:34] knew that
[1:16:36] but when he come to abraham abraham
[1:16:38] didn't know that
[1:16:39] i don't think abraham realized a lot of
[1:16:41] things
[1:16:43] i i don't believe he was well i'm going
[1:16:44] to wake up today and be the father of
[1:16:46] the faith
[1:16:48] no he woke up hungry
[1:16:50] and was looking for sarah to fix him
[1:16:52] something to eat
[1:16:53] and then he picks up lot and then he
[1:16:54] picks up this one and he does
[1:16:56] part what god said doesn't that kind of
[1:16:58] fit our bill today
[1:17:01] abraham didn't do exactly what god said
[1:17:04] but now did god not bless abraham no he
[1:17:06] blessed abraham
[1:17:09] all right and there's a little point
[1:17:10] there that we'll say for later therefore
[1:17:13] he by election he chose abraham for he
[1:17:15] knew what abraham would do
[1:17:17] you remember when he called him out
[1:17:18] there and he did not
[1:17:20] keep the things a secret from him when
[1:17:22] he was going down to destroy sodom and
[1:17:23] gomorrah he said for i know that abraham
[1:17:25] will teach his children
[1:17:27] you know i like that brother brown said
[1:17:29] the reason he called abraham and the
[1:17:31] reason he liked abraham he knew abraham
[1:17:33] would not
[1:17:34] keep
[1:17:34] a secret what went on in his life he
[1:17:37] would tell his children and his
[1:17:39] children's children down through the
[1:17:40] generation
[1:17:41] all right god himself will teach his
[1:17:43] children i know it god himself i know
[1:17:45] that abraham will send this message on
[1:17:47] down from one to the other generation
[1:17:50] well that's wonderful so let's read this
[1:17:52] god's covenant confirmed
[1:17:54] just read the are they putting up the
[1:17:55] black part are you putting up the whole
[1:17:56] thing
[1:17:59] okay
[1:18:00] well i'm reading down a little bit lower
[1:18:02] than that okay
[1:18:05] so i'll just read let's just read the
[1:18:06] whole thing
[1:18:07] god's covenant with abraham then
[1:18:09] e15 paragraph 15. now jesus didn't come
[1:18:12] to calvary just for a haphazard thought
[1:18:14] well i'll die up there and perhaps
[1:18:16] somebody will feel sorry now see that's
[1:18:18] that's most people
[1:18:20] now my dad has a methodist
[1:18:22] minister that's a his brother
[1:18:24] and natural brother
[1:18:26] and that's what he believes
[1:18:28] he believed that god just thought
[1:18:29] somebody feels sorry for him
[1:18:32] and we hear we see the quotes of brother
[1:18:34] branham but this is a physical man that
[1:18:35] preaches in his church
[1:18:37] jesus just came here felt
[1:18:40] hoping somebody feel sorry for him dying
[1:18:43] and it gets saved
[1:18:45] well now
[1:18:51] he's from georgia sorry
[1:18:53] but i mean that's what he thinks and
[1:18:55] that's why hey you go ask people
[1:18:58] go ask them say why did jesus die
[1:19:01] well well some
[1:19:03] he thought i'd feel sorry for him and
[1:19:05] get saved no he came down here for a
[1:19:07] purpose
[1:19:08] because he knew by for knowledge
[1:19:11] what would happen when he got here
[1:19:15] to me that's the most simple thing in
[1:19:16] the world
[1:19:18] is for knowledge and predestination all
[1:19:21] right so let's read now jesus didn't
[1:19:22] come to calvary just for a haphazard
[1:19:24] thought well i'll die up there perhaps
[1:19:26] maybe somebody will feel sorry for me
[1:19:27] and come down and get saved no no god
[1:19:29] don't run his office like that
[1:19:31] you don't run your office like that
[1:19:33] jesus come for one specific purpose that
[1:19:36] was to redeem those
[1:19:38] that god what
[1:19:41] oh
[1:19:42] not that he predestinated
[1:19:45] he foreknew
[1:19:47] would be redeemed see now god's not
[1:19:49] willing that any should perish but that
[1:19:51] all would come to repentance but in
[1:19:52] order to be god
[1:19:54] he had to know
[1:19:56] now the word predestinate as is used in
[1:19:58] ephesians 1 5 predestinate there isn't a
[1:20:01] good word
[1:20:04] it means in speaking of predestination
[1:20:06] to the people sometimes leads them to
[1:20:07] think that god just predestinated you to
[1:20:10] push you through a little pipe or
[1:20:12] something
[1:20:14] that's not right
[1:20:16] predestination looks back to
[1:20:18] foreknowledge
[1:20:21] and foreknowledge looks to destiny
[1:20:25] because if he didn't know what was going
[1:20:27] to happen he couldn't predestinate he
[1:20:28] would be finite like me and you
[1:20:31] he knew exactly how many kids he was
[1:20:33] going to have he knew how many people
[1:20:34] was going to love him he knew how many
[1:20:36] people was going to hate him
[1:20:39] you say well that's predetermined it's
[1:20:40] predetermined by fore-knowing
[1:20:44] by for knowing what would happen when he
[1:20:46] got here or when you got here or when
[1:20:48] hitler got here or when
[1:20:50] whoever you
[1:20:53] so if you'll simply leave it as
[1:20:55] foreknowledge he foreign you this
[1:20:58] before it ever happened
[1:21:01] all right so you can put there
[1:21:03] and see that how god didn't pull you
[1:21:05] through a tube he didn't make you do
[1:21:07] anything
[1:21:09] but he foreknew what you do
[1:21:12] when you got here
[1:21:14] my uh
[1:21:15] uh my grandpa he my dad was
[1:21:18] my grandpa was 64 when my dad was born
[1:21:23] praise the lord
[1:21:25] and
[1:21:28] pretty strong guy
[1:21:29] fathered four people in his sixties four
[1:21:31] children in the sixties set of twins and
[1:21:32] my dad so anyway so he was out picking
[1:21:35] cotton with with grandma one day and and
[1:21:37] they were talking about predestination
[1:21:40] and this true story grandma told it so
[1:21:43] they were picking cotton and said he
[1:21:44] said
[1:21:45] her name was hannah so he said han
[1:21:47] said hand does god know i'm gonna pick a
[1:21:49] bowl of cotton right there she said sure
[1:21:51] he does so he walks around it
[1:21:55] he thinks he's pulling something over on
[1:21:56] god
[1:21:57] but she says
[1:21:58] sam he knew you were going to do that
[1:22:02] he foreign knew
[1:22:04] that you were going to walk around it
[1:22:05] you're not you see that sometimes that's
[1:22:06] our mentality
[1:22:08] you know well predestination is just
[1:22:12] it's not
[1:22:15] now predestinated to a promise is signed
[1:22:17] sealed and delivered because god knows
[1:22:20] who that's going to be
[1:22:22] and you've got but the only way we've
[1:22:23] got to do it to get back is by his
[1:22:26] perfect will
[1:22:27] all right this right here this is what's
[1:22:29] going to put us back
[1:22:31] to that connection with god
[1:22:33] because his will is his word and it's
[1:22:35] his perfect will
[1:22:37] and his will will come to pass
[1:22:41] nothing we can do about that it will
[1:22:43] come to pass but you've got to decide
[1:22:45] whether you want to be a part of that or
[1:22:47] not
[1:22:48] this may be so simple that you just fall
[1:22:50] asleep but to me it's profound that that
[1:22:53] that for knowledge come first
[1:22:55] those who he foreknew
[1:22:57] he did predestinate
[1:23:01] in his mind it stamped
[1:23:04] sealed and delivered because he's
[1:23:06] infinite
[1:23:07] but you and i are finite
[1:23:10] we have our problems in life we have
[1:23:12] things that we do but you know god knows
[1:23:13] every one of them
[1:23:15] and i thought that was a funny analogy
[1:23:16] that you know he said walks around the
[1:23:17] bowl of cotton you know it's like he's
[1:23:19] pulling something over on god
[1:23:20] she said honey
[1:23:22] god knew you wasn't going to pick it
[1:23:25] so that's and but that's the way what
[1:23:26] sometimes our mentality is but it wants
[1:23:28] to get away from that i want us to get
[1:23:29] away that god is
[1:23:31] not finite god is infinite
[1:23:34] he knew what you would do if you'd never
[1:23:36] heard of this message
[1:23:38] or he's or he's finite
[1:23:40] but now that you have come into the
[1:23:42] promise does everybody understand when
[1:23:43] you've come into the promise and
[1:23:45] connected yourself to the promise then
[1:23:48] you are predestinated predestinated is
[1:23:51] the promise
[1:23:52] predestination is your journey to get to
[1:23:54] the promise
[1:23:56] you receive the promise of the holy
[1:23:58] ghost right
[1:23:59] to your children them that are far off
[1:24:00] all right let's keep reading for just a
[1:24:01] second
[1:24:02] and foreknowledge looks to destiny
[1:24:05] let's read paragraph 16. therefore
[1:24:07] god being god before the foundation of
[1:24:10] the world
[1:24:11] knew that who would be saved and who
[1:24:13] would not
[1:24:14] so like i said he knew
[1:24:16] that's it
[1:24:18] but we don't know
[1:24:20] all right
[1:24:23] romans 8 he could say that he hated esau
[1:24:26] and loved jacob
[1:24:27] before either child was born by
[1:24:29] foreknowledge
[1:24:31] he'd know that a little shyster that
[1:24:33] esau would be
[1:24:35] and how he would save jacob so therefore
[1:24:38] by foreknowledge
[1:24:39] god knew these things for knowledge god
[1:24:42] knew these things
[1:24:43] but now you know look at the life of
[1:24:44] jacob mesa
[1:24:46] who would you pick
[1:24:50] if you were writing a commentary and you
[1:24:52] were walk you walked into their house
[1:24:54] and you looked at the two sons who would
[1:24:57] you pick
[1:24:59] he called esau shyster i think jacob was
[1:25:02] a pretty good one
[1:25:04] but remember he had respect to one thing
[1:25:06] the promise
[1:25:08] or the birthright he it was a birthright
[1:25:11] we can type that with the holy ghost but
[1:25:13] you know what it wasn't that to jacob
[1:25:16] it was just a first blessing
[1:25:18] wasn't anything to him going to heaven
[1:25:20] or not it was just the first blessing he
[1:25:22] was wanting he wanted that blessing from
[1:25:24] his father so he did what he did and boy
[1:25:26] to look at the commentary you would say
[1:25:28] he saw how i loved and jacob have i
[1:25:30] hated
[1:25:32] but remember
[1:25:33] jacob and esau watch their life
[1:25:38] esau had no respect for the birthright
[1:25:41] jacob had respect for the birthright jim
[1:25:43] pinson had respect for the holy ghost
[1:25:46] xyz did not
[1:25:48] so you can see that
[1:25:50] you know you wonder you and i've told
[1:25:52] you many times i think i've told you
[1:25:54] here sitting in the airport in atlanta
[1:25:56] you just see thousands of people
[1:25:58] walking by and
[1:26:01] you know i just one day i said lord
[1:26:05] why not
[1:26:06] them why not them well
[1:26:10] you know you see people walking by all
[1:26:11] walks of life and and some rich and some
[1:26:14] poor and some you know they're just
[1:26:15] running back and forth you know trying
[1:26:17] to get on the flight and all these
[1:26:18] things and i thought lord why me and not
[1:26:22] them
[1:26:25] you know what he spoke to me and said
[1:26:28] you chose and i and they didn't
[1:26:31] see it comes down to one thing
[1:26:33] you chose that's what he said to me he
[1:26:34] said you chose me and they didn't
[1:26:39] for knowledge
[1:26:41] not predestinated for knowledge
[1:26:44] he foreknew
[1:26:45] that i would want it
[1:26:47] when i got here
[1:26:48] not that he was just going to give it to
[1:26:50] me because i was good
[1:26:53] because listen
[1:26:56] i'm a pretty good guy
[1:26:59] jim don't do that don't don't just don't
[1:27:05] okay i'll say i'm a pretty good guy i
[1:27:07] don't need your opinion no i'm just
[1:27:08] kidding
[1:27:09] no i'm a pretty good guy but you know in
[1:27:10] god's eyes i'm
[1:27:12] dead
[1:27:13] we can't even go before god
[1:27:16] himself as a person
[1:27:19] in this way we are now even born again
[1:27:21] brother braham said one second in front
[1:27:22] of god in these sinful bodies were
[1:27:24] annihilated right
[1:27:26] wow
[1:27:27] so we depend on that blood covering
[1:27:31] but have you ever read a i preached on a
[1:27:33] little sermon on the book of books
[1:27:35] and
[1:27:36] you have to see that even in judgment
[1:27:38] when you're standing in judgment
[1:27:42] what makes you better than the person
[1:27:43] that we're going to judge
[1:27:47] because the bible says
[1:27:50] the bible says that the books were open
[1:27:52] and they were judged by
[1:27:54] their
[1:27:55] works
[1:27:58] foolish virgin anybody that comes to the
[1:28:00] white throne judgment has got to be
[1:28:02] judged by
[1:28:03] their
[1:28:04] works
[1:28:05] i do not ever want to be judged by my my
[1:28:09] works
[1:28:11] never do i want to go on my works
[1:28:14] but now remember faith and works go
[1:28:16] together you you those two will coincide
[1:28:20] but
[1:28:20] i don't ever want to go before god with
[1:28:22] my works
[1:28:25] in front of
[1:28:26] me because we accepted christ
[1:28:31] we accepted his sacrifice
[1:28:35] now there's the predestinated
[1:28:37] predestinated chosen in him i read in
[1:28:40] ephesians chosen in him
[1:28:42] not by him or for it we were chosen in
[1:28:44] him if i can stay in christ then i have
[1:28:47] no words
[1:28:48] i'm judged by his works
[1:28:51] amen
[1:28:53] hallelujah
[1:28:54] if not when we go before judgment you
[1:28:57] pass this life without the new birth
[1:28:59] you're going to be judged by the works
[1:29:01] you did on this earth
[1:29:03] and i don't even want to be judged even
[1:29:05] standing in a pulpit because there's bad
[1:29:07] thoughts go through my brain
[1:29:11] so i want his works
[1:29:13] i want to get in that predestinated
[1:29:16] group of people
[1:29:19] you say well don't you know well yeah i
[1:29:21] do now
[1:29:22] but i didn't before
[1:29:24] i don't have four knowledge
[1:29:27] oh we can think of something we're gonna
[1:29:28] do tomorrow i'm gonna fly out tomorrow
[1:29:29] four o'clock something could happen
[1:29:33] but with god that's not true he's not
[1:29:34] gonna go
[1:29:37] you know god's not nervous he don't you
[1:29:38] don't have a you know he just doesn't
[1:29:41] we get all nervous about well god what
[1:29:43] are you gonna do well he's gonna play
[1:29:44] going i know what i'm gonna do
[1:29:47] i knew it before you got here what i was
[1:29:49] gonna do what you were gonna do
[1:29:51] but see we might sometimes we make god
[1:29:53] so
[1:29:54] uh so human which he was
[1:29:57] but still he's he's infinite so he's
[1:29:59] all-knowing he knows everything
[1:30:01] you know we pull a little crooked deal
[1:30:02] or we or we say a little something about
[1:30:04] this one or something about that when
[1:30:05] you saw nobody heard me oh yeah they did
[1:30:09] there's about 10 million angels heard it
[1:30:12] and it was wrote in a book somewhere and
[1:30:13] i think god's got it now so you
[1:30:16] don't think you can hide therefore god
[1:30:18] being god before the foundational world
[1:30:19] knew who would be saved and who would
[1:30:21] not
[1:30:22] that's romans 8 all right let's go to
[1:30:24] number four
[1:30:27] we will see jesus dallas texas 1958
[1:30:30] now the world won't see no matter
[1:30:32] there's people born we hate to say this
[1:30:35] there's people that were born to eternal
[1:30:37] destruction
[1:30:38] how
[1:30:40] not by predestination or he has chose
[1:30:43] them
[1:30:45] and not me
[1:30:47] respect your persons
[1:30:49] but by for knowledge i keep going over
[1:30:51] here because this is the mind of god
[1:30:52] we're we won't have time for that but in
[1:30:55] you in the mind of god i don't want to
[1:30:57] be
[1:30:58] you say well well i want to be in the
[1:30:59] mind of god
[1:31:02] judas was in the mind of god
[1:31:05] you've got to become a part of the mind
[1:31:08] you got to become a part of the thinker
[1:31:11] that means when it says in christ
[1:31:17] yeah i know you're chewing on that a man
[1:31:18] that's fine
[1:31:20] chewing that a while
[1:31:21] i don't want to be thought of
[1:31:25] judas was thought of
[1:31:27] jesus called him friend
[1:31:31] but i want to be part of the thinker
[1:31:34] i want i want to be so much a part of
[1:31:37] this one that thought of me that by
[1:31:39] foreknowledge he knew
[1:31:42] that my nights and days and that all the
[1:31:44] things that i did
[1:31:45] was
[1:31:46] was for him
[1:31:48] all right so listen to this
[1:31:50] we will see jesus now let's take this
[1:31:52] there's people born we hate to say this
[1:31:53] that they're born to eternal destruction
[1:31:56] by for knowledge i'm not adding to the
[1:31:59] word i'm telling you exactly what he's
[1:32:01] saying because watch what he says
[1:32:04] because look scripture says so romans 8
[1:32:06] before esau or jacob was ever born or
[1:32:08] come from their mother's womb god said i
[1:32:10] hate esau and love jacob before either
[1:32:12] child had a chance
[1:32:14] god by not by predestination by his will
[1:32:19] you reading that
[1:32:24] make you think about predestination a
[1:32:25] little bit different from now
[1:32:29] not predestination by his will but by
[1:32:32] his foreknowledge
[1:32:34] he knew that esau was a shyster to begin
[1:32:36] with excuse that expression but that
[1:32:38] just means a renegade
[1:32:40] so that's what he was and god by
[1:32:42] foreknowledge knew it and some people
[1:32:45] no matter what you would do
[1:32:47] they'll still disbelieve it
[1:32:52] but god's just he keeps his word all
[1:32:55] right let's go to number
[1:32:57] four again book of exodus
[1:33:01] 1955 the word predestinate that's not a
[1:33:04] good word to use the word foreknowledge
[1:33:06] is better now how many times have you
[1:33:07] heard him say that now you're going to
[1:33:08] hear him say it a lot now foreknowledge
[1:33:10] is better
[1:33:13] predestination looks back to
[1:33:15] foreknowledge
[1:33:17] and foreknowledge looks to destination
[1:33:19] as simple as it can be but god not
[1:33:21] making set in order a little hole that
[1:33:23] you have to go through and can't go no
[1:33:26] other way you see that
[1:33:29] and can't go no
[1:33:30] other way
[1:33:33] that's not what god did but god in order
[1:33:34] to be god he'd know then from the
[1:33:36] beginning so he could predict it and set
[1:33:39] things in order to happen
[1:33:41] okay now notice by god's wise providence
[1:33:44] he had revealed by spiritual revelation
[1:33:46] that this was going to be his chosen
[1:33:48] vessel
[1:33:49] and his mother wasn't the scared of the
[1:33:50] king's commandment for by faith he saw
[1:33:52] him with the children of israel placing
[1:33:54] them over in the promised land talking
[1:33:55] about moses
[1:33:58] all right let's read where i think
[1:33:59] pentecost failed 1955 11-11
[1:34:05] but if we only go back find out when god
[1:34:07] made his first man he made him in his
[1:34:09] own image and god is a spirit so he had
[1:34:11] to make spirit man now the word is used
[1:34:13] here in the fifth verse of
[1:34:14] predestination predestinated it's not a
[1:34:17] very good word for an evangelist or a
[1:34:19] minister to use because this kind of
[1:34:20] confuses the people when you say
[1:34:22] predestinate
[1:34:23] predestination speaks looks back to
[1:34:26] foreknowledge
[1:34:27] for knowledge looks to destination
[1:34:29] predestination goes back to for
[1:34:32] knowledge
[1:34:33] so for knowledge has got to be first
[1:34:36] for knowledge has got to be first
[1:34:37] predestination goes back to
[1:34:38] foreknowledge for knowledge goes to
[1:34:41] destination all right now let's read
[1:34:43] number five questions and answers 1959
[1:34:45] the question asked now let's see now the
[1:34:48] next one here
[1:34:50] what is meant by predestination before
[1:34:52] the world begin where is it in the bible
[1:34:54] predestination before the world began
[1:34:55] all right my precious brother let's turn
[1:34:57] to ephesians first he goes to ephesians
[1:34:58] 1.
[1:34:59] now the first thing i want to say this
[1:35:01] that predestination is a bad word for a
[1:35:03] minister to use before an untrained
[1:35:04] congregation see it is i don't use it
[1:35:07] sometimes here at the church but out in
[1:35:08] the audience out in the big
[1:35:10] places in other words where everything's
[1:35:11] piled from everywhere i watch that word
[1:35:13] i always use the word for knowledge
[1:35:16] because predestination is only the
[1:35:18] foreknowledge of god
[1:35:21] that's what it is
[1:35:22] it's the foreknowledge of god that's
[1:35:24] what predestination totally consists of
[1:35:26] is the foreknowledge of god if he can't
[1:35:28] foreknow anything he cannot predestinate
[1:35:30] but by the way he can foreknow
[1:35:32] everything he can predestinate all right
[1:35:34] that's what scripture says all right
[1:35:37] i always use the word for knowledge
[1:35:38] because predestination is only the
[1:35:40] foreknowledge of god god being infinite
[1:35:41] by foreknowledge he knew everything
[1:35:44] or he wasn't
[1:35:47] infinite
[1:35:48] all right number six
[1:35:49] ephesians parallels joshua 1960
[1:35:52] listen to this
[1:35:53] it's what he said listen to this
[1:35:55] predestination looks back to
[1:35:56] foreknowledge
[1:35:57] i mean election he brings election in
[1:36:00] now
[1:36:01] because the bible does say elect
[1:36:04] huh
[1:36:05] if you read the scripture in peter we'll
[1:36:07] read it in just a minute elect according
[1:36:10] to what
[1:36:11] for knowledge of god
[1:36:13] that's the only way you're elected is
[1:36:14] god for knew you were going to choose
[1:36:18] him or the devil there's only two
[1:36:20] choices
[1:36:21] all right the only two spirits that we
[1:36:23] got to deal with listen to this
[1:36:25] but now watch
[1:36:28] and i want to i want to interject
[1:36:29] something here just just for a moment i
[1:36:31] i've never talked to brother jim about
[1:36:32] this but but i want to kind of let you
[1:36:34] know how i feel about it
[1:36:37] is everybody brings to the message that
[1:36:40] we were born with this seed in us and we
[1:36:41] were born with this eternal life and we
[1:36:44] i can't see that
[1:36:46] based on what people say
[1:36:49] is being a seed or a spot or a and i
[1:36:52] know brother brown says you were born
[1:36:54] with a seed in you
[1:36:56] i thought the bible says the seed is the
[1:36:58] word
[1:36:59] now look
[1:37:01] and who is this melchizedek brother
[1:37:02] brown said we bypass
[1:37:05] the word
[1:37:06] to become flesh
[1:37:08] we bypass our theophany jesus came word
[1:37:12] that's what made us different
[1:37:14] that's why when he was looking at
[1:37:14] nicodemus he said nicodemus you need to
[1:37:16] be born again
[1:37:17] i was born right you need to be born the
[1:37:19] way i was born he said be born from
[1:37:21] above all right
[1:37:23] so i just can't go with that i'm sorry
[1:37:27] because i know i was born in sin shape
[1:37:29] and iniquity a spouse of my mother's
[1:37:30] womb a liar
[1:37:32] i i needed to receive eternal life
[1:37:35] if i came here with it
[1:37:38] jesus didn't have to die
[1:37:41] i'm glad you're really thinking about
[1:37:43] this because
[1:37:44] i don't want i don't want us as
[1:37:46] believers
[1:37:48] to get to the point where say well i
[1:37:49] don't need nothing i was always this and
[1:37:51] i was always that doesn't matter what i
[1:37:53] do and that's what they do when they
[1:37:54] bring in that doctrine of we can have
[1:37:58] polygamy or we can have this we can have
[1:38:00] that we always was yeah in god you
[1:38:02] always were because of his foreknowledge
[1:38:06] you always were son and daughter of god
[1:38:07] if you ever were one you were one back
[1:38:09] there
[1:38:12] you had to come down here to realize it
[1:38:15] but you were born in sin
[1:38:18] shaping an iniquity
[1:38:19] i don't see how permissive will and
[1:38:21] perfect will came together
[1:38:23] except it's a new birth
[1:38:26] because if we were born right the first
[1:38:27] time
[1:38:29] why do you need a second birth
[1:38:32] you understand what i'm saying
[1:38:33] we got all the quotes flying around you
[1:38:35] know and i believe if you look at it the
[1:38:37] correct way
[1:38:38] you always were eternal
[1:38:40] you not you
[1:38:43] come on people this wasn't eternal
[1:38:45] this had a beginning
[1:38:48] and it'll have an end
[1:38:51] but i wasn't this if i came with the
[1:38:53] seed of eternal life in me
[1:38:56] then that's a respecter of persons
[1:38:59] that's just the way i see it i'm sorry
[1:39:01] the bible says after you received the
[1:39:02] gospel of your salvation after you
[1:39:04] received this after you received that we
[1:39:06] had to receive something
[1:39:10] when i was doing the things of the world
[1:39:12] god was nowhere to be seen
[1:39:14] in my life
[1:39:17] but one day there was something sure
[1:39:19] enough was laying there
[1:39:21] but what was it laying in here or was it
[1:39:23] laying in
[1:39:24] here see if you put it laying in here
[1:39:28] and then you respond to that
[1:39:32] that's the foreknowledge of god he put
[1:39:33] this here
[1:39:35] this is predestinated eternally from god
[1:39:37] remember what he said this right here
[1:39:39] the word of god
[1:39:40] the word is a seed
[1:39:44] so i can't say i was born special
[1:39:48] if i do then god's going to have to say
[1:39:49] adolf hitler was born special
[1:39:52] i just like to see that i knew i was a
[1:39:54] sinner
[1:39:56] and if i didn't accept christ i was gone
[1:40:02] that's just the way i see it or you take
[1:40:04] salvation all the way out of the picture
[1:40:09] i like to know that somebody died for me
[1:40:12] and it was almighty god
[1:40:15] because you know what by foreign
[1:40:16] knowledge though
[1:40:19] he knew i would want it
[1:40:21] so we had it there when i needed it not
[1:40:23] that it developed
[1:40:26] it was there
[1:40:28] but where was it was it in me or was it
[1:40:30] what did you respond to
[1:40:31] i responded to a man preaching a sermon
[1:40:35] the ethiopian eunuch
[1:40:38] now if the ethiopian unit was always was
[1:40:40] eternal why did he need philip
[1:40:46] why did he need philip
[1:40:49] philip had the seed because he was
[1:40:50] already born again
[1:40:52] he comes down and talks to the ethiopian
[1:40:54] eunuch
[1:40:56] and god revealed the word
[1:40:59] remember
[1:41:01] everybody understand what i'm saying
[1:41:03] what i want to do is i don't want to
[1:41:04] start a doctrine i just want to tell you
[1:41:06] that i knew i was lost
[1:41:08] i needed a savior
[1:41:10] i needed somebody to
[1:41:11] message or no message
[1:41:13] there's going to be billions of people
[1:41:15] in this world that never heard of
[1:41:16] william brennan that are going to be
[1:41:17] saved sanctified and filled with the
[1:41:19] holy ghost
[1:41:20] not now
[1:41:21] but back in the church ages they ever
[1:41:23] knew who william branham was or the
[1:41:25] message
[1:41:28] the pentecostals azusa street
[1:41:30] brother brown was just a baby
[1:41:33] so there's going to be billions of
[1:41:34] people that's not going to be there
[1:41:35] because of the message
[1:41:38] but you and i are a special group of
[1:41:39] people
[1:41:40] we have a special token
[1:41:43] it's not different
[1:41:45] but it's special
[1:41:47] because we're taking hours right up to
[1:41:48] that position
[1:41:52] right here
[1:41:54] wesley luther couldn't get there
[1:41:56] they had their point that they got to
[1:41:59] just shall live by faith live a good
[1:42:01] clean life
[1:42:02] but you and i are predestinated to a
[1:42:04] rapture
[1:42:05] that's what i end up with you're
[1:42:07] predestinated to a rapture that's the
[1:42:09] predestination that's that spot i was
[1:42:11] talking about before
[1:42:14] and it's your choice whether you get
[1:42:16] there or not
[1:42:17] you say oh i'm insufficient i'm this i'm
[1:42:19] there
[1:42:21] moses said the same thing
[1:42:24] moses said god i can't even talk good
[1:42:27] he must have been a southerner
[1:42:29] he said i can't talk well
[1:42:32] because i said don't worry i've already
[1:42:33] got that taken care of
[1:42:36] you just tell aaron and aaron must be
[1:42:37] able to speak very well he can he can he
[1:42:39] can he can do the talking but see god
[1:42:42] had a provision there but i want you to
[1:42:43] see that
[1:42:44] that
[1:42:45] god by foreknowledge
[1:42:48] knew you would want it and he had it
[1:42:50] there for you
[1:42:53] is that just too simple but by
[1:42:56] foreknowledge he knew you would want it
[1:42:58] more than the other guy at walmart or
[1:43:00] the girl or or your family member or
[1:43:02] some we we always we worry about those
[1:43:04] things in our mind we say god why me
[1:43:07] just like i said you sit there and you
[1:43:09] watch these people that has i mean they
[1:43:10] go out of your life in a few seconds
[1:43:13] but they have no purpose
[1:43:16] they have no
[1:43:17] we know what their end is but they don't
[1:43:20] they're working themselves to death and
[1:43:21] they're worrying about this and worrying
[1:43:22] about that and here they go through the
[1:43:24] airport never see them again but you
[1:43:26] know they're going to a to a place of
[1:43:27] work or a place or a home or a family
[1:43:30] you say well god why me why why me and
[1:43:32] he just spoke to me and he said well you
[1:43:33] chose me and they didn't
[1:43:37] you say oh brother i'm saying you didn't
[1:43:38] have anything to do with it
[1:43:40] well
[1:43:43] no you didn't
[1:43:45] yeah you did
[1:43:49] no you didn't but yeah you did
[1:43:51] you had to accept
[1:43:54] because god came down to me one day
[1:43:57] and he said do you want to be my child
[1:44:00] and i accept it
[1:44:02] and he knew that before the foundation
[1:44:04] of the world
[1:44:06] and i went to an altar
[1:44:08] and i got my sins
[1:44:10] put in the sea of god's forgetfulness
[1:44:13] never to be remembered again
[1:44:17] but you know what
[1:44:18] god already knew that
[1:44:22] because he had it ready for me
[1:44:24] because by foreign knowledge he knew
[1:44:25] that day would come
[1:44:28] same way with you if you ever come to
[1:44:30] god
[1:44:31] that's the same place
[1:44:33] that he saw you before the foundation of
[1:44:35] the world
[1:44:37] that's the spot he saw you
[1:44:39] now
[1:44:40] then after we become a christian
[1:44:44] like i said we have doors and doors we
[1:44:45] have things like that but let's let me
[1:44:47] read a couple more quotes and then we'll
[1:44:48] then we'll finish right here
[1:44:51] let's read let's skip over to
[1:44:55] jehovah gyra it's number eight guys at
[1:44:57] grass valley california
[1:44:59] brother brown said now there's a
[1:45:00] doctrine of predestination which is
[1:45:02] rotten nonsense but there really is true
[1:45:05] predestination god by foreknowledge
[1:45:07] could predestinate
[1:45:10] because he has foreknowledge
[1:45:13] god's not willing that any should perish
[1:45:15] but being the infinite god knew that who
[1:45:17] would perish and who would not
[1:45:20] that's the reason he said before isaac
[1:45:21] or before jacob and esau was born he
[1:45:23] hated he saw and loved jacob his
[1:45:25] foreknowledge let him know that esau was
[1:45:27] a shyster and let him know that jacob
[1:45:29] respected that birthright regardless of
[1:45:31] how he got it he wanted it
[1:45:33] now the both boys twins born from the
[1:45:35] same holy mother and father
[1:45:39] so that takes your seedline out of the
[1:45:40] way there he jacob wasn't born this good
[1:45:42] seed in east all born of bad seed they
[1:45:44] both was born from a good seed
[1:45:46] right
[1:45:48] right
[1:45:49] isaac
[1:45:50] right they were born from the same mom
[1:45:51] and daddy
[1:45:52] all right but it was the choice they
[1:45:56] made i then now let's go to number nine
[1:45:59] this will be the last one blasphemous
[1:46:00] names a little close
[1:46:03] now watch brother
[1:46:04] 1962.
[1:46:08] paragraph 26 i want everybody to see
[1:46:10] this
[1:46:15] here we go keep it going there you go
[1:46:17] i believe there is a bride that's
[1:46:19] predestinated
[1:46:26] i believe god said he would have a
[1:46:28] church without spot or wrinkle
[1:46:31] i believe in predestination that the
[1:46:33] bride is predestinated she's got to be
[1:46:37] there
[1:46:38] i hope i'm with her
[1:46:43] that see i'm with her now it's up to me
[1:46:47] to work out my own salvation with god
[1:46:50] until these things are approved of god
[1:46:52] are you reading this with me
[1:46:55] and then sealed into the kingdom of god
[1:46:58] and then sealed into the kingdom of god
[1:47:00] you read that
[1:47:02] okay
[1:47:05] there's the holy spirit there's the
[1:47:08] genuine works of god it's sealed until
[1:47:11] the day of redemption
[1:47:13] and then he was talking about this dream
[1:47:14] now paragraph
[1:47:16] 26-3 now therefore when she does that
[1:47:19] when that church comes to that place or
[1:47:22] the individual the church is going to be
[1:47:24] there let me say it real good so you can
[1:47:26] get it the church is predestinated to be
[1:47:29] there
[1:47:30] i want to be with it but the only way
[1:47:32] i'll be with it is to be a part of it
[1:47:36] how do i become a part of it by being in
[1:47:38] it
[1:47:39] how do i get in it by baptism by one
[1:47:42] spirit first corinthians 12 by one
[1:47:43] spirit we're all baptized into one body
[1:47:46] one body
[1:47:48] baptized
[1:47:49] into that body amen
[1:47:52] for knowledge of god
[1:47:54] the foreknowledge
[1:47:56] is first
[1:47:58] that's the first thing
[1:48:00] then you got predestination
[1:48:02] and the predestinated because
[1:48:04] predestination is the journey does
[1:48:05] everybody understand i'm going to say it
[1:48:06] again yeah i've said it 15 times so that
[1:48:08] was about
[1:48:09] three so i got about
[1:48:11] 15 12 13 more but predestination is the
[1:48:14] journey he sees the journey
[1:48:17] he sees what you do if you this one or
[1:48:19] this one or this one i told him up in
[1:48:21] virginia not too long ago i said you
[1:48:22] know i said the civil war was fought
[1:48:24] mostly in virginia georgia tennessee
[1:48:27] uh places like that
[1:48:28] and there were six hundred thousand men
[1:48:30] killed in the civil war
[1:48:33] six hundred thousand men
[1:48:35] so unless they and they were usually
[1:48:37] young men
[1:48:38] there were six hundred thousand men
[1:48:40] killed so that was six hundred thousand
[1:48:43] generations that were stopped
[1:48:47] have you thought about that
[1:48:49] that's 600 000 generations if they
[1:48:51] didn't have children that were stopped
[1:48:55] now you can rest assured one thing
[1:48:57] you weren't in that 600 000. you were
[1:49:00] not found in that group
[1:49:02] there was a many stories told up there
[1:49:04] of of the great great great grandfathers
[1:49:06] that that you know a bullet would crease
[1:49:10] you know increase their cheap but the
[1:49:13] guy over here got killed
[1:49:15] see that's god's providence
[1:49:17] he's getting you here
[1:49:20] brother brown said he bred this one to
[1:49:21] this one
[1:49:22] this one to this one
[1:49:24] this one to this one to get you here
[1:49:26] he put those characters together
[1:49:29] because he knew what you'd be when you
[1:49:30] got here that's the foreknowledge of god
[1:49:32] he foreign knew
[1:49:34] what kind of character you'd have
[1:49:37] and so the perfect will of god just
[1:49:38] worked right down into the permissive
[1:49:40] will down here just works right down and
[1:49:42] then guess what
[1:49:43] to get you here and to love him
[1:49:46] and become a part of him then go back
[1:49:51] in that redemption redemption is not
[1:49:52] replacement
[1:49:54] this gets lost
[1:49:57] this has got to come back
[1:49:59] right
[1:50:01] so you were lost and you had to come
[1:50:02] back
[1:50:04] and that's what we're getting to but
[1:50:05] remember it's for knowledge you say well
[1:50:07] i'm predestinated
[1:50:09] be careful
[1:50:10] just want you to think about that just
[1:50:12] be careful
[1:50:14] because judas was predestinated too
[1:50:20] adolf hitler was predestinated too
[1:50:25] all the
[1:50:26] ones that's going to go to hell
[1:50:28] were predestinated
[1:50:30] so be careful when you say i'm
[1:50:32] predestinated
[1:50:34] but if you take foreknowledge
[1:50:36] and know
[1:50:37] that now you have the mind of god
[1:50:40] you can look back and say god you
[1:50:42] foreknew me
[1:50:44] like jesus said i had pleasure with you
[1:50:45] father before the foundation of the
[1:50:46] world and job says where were you when
[1:50:48] when the morning started saying together
[1:50:50] and the sons of god shout out for joy we
[1:50:51] weren't back there as people
[1:50:53] we were back there in the attribute of
[1:50:55] god that i i when i was a father wanted
[1:50:57] to have children
[1:50:59] because that made you know to make me a
[1:51:00] father i had to have kids so i want to
[1:51:02] be a father but i didn't know because
[1:51:04] i'm finite i did not know how many i was
[1:51:06] going to have but god being infinite he
[1:51:08] knew how many he was going to have so he
[1:51:10] was overjoyed that jim pinkston was
[1:51:12] going to be here in the last stage and
[1:51:13] take a body change he was overjoyed jim
[1:51:16] and and sister darlene and all of you
[1:51:18] everybody got together and you come here
[1:51:20] and
[1:51:21] my could we not stand up and tell how
[1:51:23] our journey got us here
[1:51:26] well that was the predestination of god
[1:51:29] but it was by foreknowledge he knew
[1:51:34] you would do when he presented it to you
[1:51:37] he knew what you'd do with it he knew
[1:51:38] how you would handle it some can't
[1:51:40] handle that we were talking some can
[1:51:41] only handle milk
[1:51:44] but you know what i like a little milk
[1:51:45] but i like a steak too and crab legs
[1:51:50] and all the other things that go with it
[1:51:52] i like all that but i do like a good
[1:51:54] cold glass of milk every once in a while
[1:51:55] so don't throw the milk out
[1:51:58] don't throw the baby out with the bath
[1:51:59] water you know you got to take the milk
[1:52:01] but i like some milk with some steak i
[1:52:02] can't just live off of milk
[1:52:05] i have to live off something that
[1:52:06] because you know what god wants us this
[1:52:08] is my last statement god wants us to be
[1:52:10] just like him
[1:52:13] he wants us to be just like him
[1:52:17] you say i can't do that well guess what
[1:52:20] you can't
[1:52:23] if you say you can't
[1:52:25] then you can't
[1:52:28] i can't be this
[1:52:30] why
[1:52:32] you sisters have the same god in you
[1:52:34] that we have
[1:52:36] now according listen according to what
[1:52:38] happened in the fall
[1:52:40] you can't be a preacher
[1:52:42] you can't handle the word like we handle
[1:52:44] the word
[1:52:45] but now remember
[1:52:46] before the fall
[1:52:48] adam and eve were equal
[1:52:53] you sisters should say amen
[1:52:56] sure were getting back to that now
[1:53:00] but but before the fall they were equal
[1:53:03] it's not going to be the sisters are
[1:53:04] going to have to just all scurry over to
[1:53:06] one side when us men walk in the future
[1:53:09] home
[1:53:10] no we're all going to have the same
[1:53:11] place
[1:53:13] we're all going to enjoy the same things
[1:53:15] we're all going to be equal
[1:53:20] all going to be equal
[1:53:22] but your sisters have a place you have
[1:53:23] to play but you have the same holy ghost
[1:53:25] i do
[1:53:27] or we're different
[1:53:29] but you do and your sisters you need to
[1:53:32] be your own have your own pulpit at home
[1:53:34] and do the things of god that that you
[1:53:36] need to do be a good wife be a be a good
[1:53:38] mother to your children if you don't
[1:53:39] have children just be a good mother to
[1:53:40] somebody else's children
[1:53:43] you know just just be a mother
[1:53:46] that's right absolutely and you deacons
[1:53:48] you ought to take care of the widows and
[1:53:49] the orphans
[1:53:51] poor little orphans around here bless
[1:53:52] their heart
[1:53:54] andy and
[1:53:56] ashley bless their heart
[1:53:59] somebody's got to be it
[1:54:02] but look
[1:54:03] you love the lord
[1:54:05] but the foreknowledge of god
[1:54:07] it's where it's at
[1:54:08] before knowledge god could predestinate
[1:54:11] this whole thing
[1:54:12] and it work out to his perfect will
[1:54:15] and you but you and i though it's the
[1:54:17] choice that we made
[1:54:19] is what determines that predestination
[1:54:24] you don't know it you don't know what
[1:54:26] tomorrow holds but you know who holds
[1:54:27] tomorrow and if we lean on our own will
[1:54:30] own understanding we're going to mess up
[1:54:33] but why not lean on the one that knows
[1:54:35] what tomorrow's going to be
[1:54:37] and if god says no
[1:54:39] take that as the best yes you'll ever
[1:54:41] get
[1:54:43] if he says uh-uh then he knows you're
[1:54:45] going to mess up if you go down that
[1:54:46] road so say okay god i'm gonna try this
[1:54:50] way
[1:54:51] and then try this way but we're all free
[1:54:52] moral agents we can do what we want to
[1:54:54] do
[1:54:56] god will never push eternal life on
[1:54:58] anybody
[1:55:00] he will not
[1:55:02] but we go back to election elect
[1:55:04] according to the foreknowledge of god
[1:55:07] how are you included in the election
[1:55:10] god voted for you the devil voted
[1:55:12] against you
[1:55:13] you swing the vote let's stand
[1:55:16] you love the lord then you gotta love me
[1:55:23] but there's something that we need to
[1:55:25] all work on and that's to be closer to
[1:55:27] god
[1:55:29] to do more of his perfect will well his
[1:55:31] perfect will's his word brother bryan
[1:55:32] said how are you going to get closer to
[1:55:33] god well you need to pray fast lay on
[1:55:35] the ground let the mule drag you through
[1:55:37] the field
[1:55:38] he said read your bible and pray
[1:55:41] so what you're doing is you're reading
[1:55:42] your will
[1:55:45] you're reading your will
[1:55:47] this is the perfect will of god i've got
[1:55:49] to decide whether i connect with that or
[1:55:51] not
[1:55:53] but when i do connect with it he can't
[1:55:55] lose me brother chad
[1:55:56] he can't lose me once i connect
[1:56:00] never will i be lost again once i
[1:56:02] connect to the to him
[1:56:05] because he can't he won't throw you away
[1:56:08] i guarantee you he'll try you
[1:56:10] if you sent a sin the prophet said
[1:56:12] you're going to reap a tub for but you
[1:56:14] know what the prodigal son when he went
[1:56:16] out
[1:56:17] he was a son
[1:56:19] he was a son
[1:56:21] he was part of the family when he went
[1:56:22] out he just what did he do he made a
[1:56:24] choice
[1:56:25] so let's now all choose make our choices
[1:56:27] you say god you know what choice i'm
[1:56:29] going to make
[1:56:31] now make it work to your perfect will
[1:56:33] make it work because you know how this
[1:56:35] thing's going to end up but i don't
[1:56:38] that makes me
[1:56:39] inefficient
[1:56:41] but he is so efficient
[1:56:44] we just look to the efficient one
[1:56:46] the one that knows all things knew it
[1:56:49] before he got here never had a crisis
[1:56:51] meeting never had a nervous moment in
[1:56:53] his life
[1:56:54] never
[1:56:56] god's not even a second older than he
[1:56:58] was when he thought all this
[1:57:00] how infinite is that
[1:57:04] let's bow our heads
[1:57:07] to emily father we pray lord that you
[1:57:10] take these words that
[1:57:11] have been spoken lord and ill
[1:57:14] strike to the heart of believers
[1:57:17] because you said lord
[1:57:18] you would send the holy ghost back to be
[1:57:20] the comforter
[1:57:22] and that you would tell us the things
[1:57:24] that you said
[1:57:26] and even show us things to come lord
[1:57:29] i pray father that you would
[1:57:31] just be with these people lord
[1:57:34] bless them in their life's journey and
[1:57:37] lord i know we all have struggles and
[1:57:38] trials and temptations and
[1:57:41] those two hundred thousand thousand
[1:57:43] demons are trained right here on us
[1:57:44] today
[1:57:46] but lord you promised
[1:57:49] a predestinated bride and when you
[1:57:52] promise a predestinated bride
[1:57:55] then we
[1:57:56] are going to be there
[1:57:59] you promised lord that in the end time
[1:58:00] we were going to be a people that would
[1:58:03] take a body change in a rapture called
[1:58:06] the dead saints out of the ground
[1:58:08] something's never been done since time
[1:58:10] began
[1:58:12] lord we got a big responsibility ahead
[1:58:13] of us
[1:58:15] but lord let us take that challenge
[1:58:18] pull out that sword of faith
[1:58:21] take that shield and be shod with the
[1:58:23] preparation of the gospel and
[1:58:26] lord you
[1:58:27] told us through the prophet that
[1:58:28] footprints means possession
[1:58:31] so everywhere these feet go
[1:58:34] lord we see redemption we see when we
[1:58:36] wash each other's feet jesus said do
[1:58:37] this till i come
[1:58:40] it shows redemption all the people that
[1:58:42] washed his feet the
[1:58:43] little prostitute washed your feet one
[1:58:45] time lord and
[1:58:46] you told her sins were forgiven
[1:58:49] lord i pray that everywhere we walk
[1:58:51] that our possession lord is
[1:58:54] centered around you
[1:58:56] not centered around our own self
[1:58:58] our own self will
[1:58:59] our own self ideas
[1:59:01] but lord they'll be around you father
[1:59:04] and that you'll condemn any sickness
[1:59:06] it's among us lord that you take those
[1:59:08] things away
[1:59:10] bless brother buddy take care of him
[1:59:11] lord we ask just be with him or
[1:59:13] strengthen him
[1:59:15] take care of each one lord here that's
[1:59:16] sick that we don't know about lord you
[1:59:18] know all things you knew it before the
[1:59:20] world began
[1:59:21] and you knew whether they'd ask for
[1:59:23] for you lord just right now to heal them
[1:59:25] father
[1:59:26] and to heal the sick of spirit lord
[1:59:30] and not just only the sick of body
[1:59:33] lord did we at all get rid of the things
[1:59:35] that we
[1:59:36] that we carry that paul said that
[1:59:39] that sin that weight that so easily
[1:59:41] besets us lord
[1:59:42] we'd run with patience
[1:59:45] looking toward the author and finisher
[1:59:47] of our faith
[1:59:49] lord knowing that you know who's going
[1:59:50] to make it and who don't but we don't
[1:59:54] but lord we strive if we if we look at
[1:59:57] your perfect will and we see our name
[1:59:58] lord
[2:00:00] we see that we're doing the right things
[2:00:01] and we're covered by your blood lord
[2:00:04] that we won't have to stand in that
[2:00:05] judgment by our own silly works the
[2:00:08] stupid things we do on this earth lord
[2:00:10] but we'll look to you father the perfect
[2:00:12] one
[2:00:13] the one that knows all things
[2:00:16] lord i pray that you just sanctify these
[2:00:18] people for the journey
[2:00:20] be with each one of us lord take care of
[2:00:21] us lead us in god us by your holy spirit
[2:00:23] lord
[2:00:25] jesus name we pray amen
[2:00:28] and also i want to remind you one thing
[2:00:29] i'm not praying for rain anymore okay
[2:00:34] bro jim sent me a text the other day and
[2:00:35] he said you can stop praying now i said
[2:00:37] look i only prayed one prayer
[2:00:42] but i told him i said the bible did say
[2:00:43] it was a sound of abundance of rain
[2:00:45] that's right and he wrote me back about
[2:00:47] two days later he said we have now had
[2:00:48] the abundance
[2:00:50] but you know it's that's another thing
[2:00:52] you know god knew that before the
[2:00:54] foundation of the world
[2:00:56] but now he didn't just come down and say
[2:00:58] i'm going to give them people rain
[2:01:00] no
[2:01:01] he had to find a vessel and i'm not
[2:01:03] saying anything for me it happened to
[2:01:04] all of us
[2:01:05] speak the word the prophet said and go
[2:01:07] forward speak the word and watch it
[2:01:09] but it just you know what it done it got
[2:01:12] into me
[2:01:13] that you guys were having a bad problem
[2:01:14] with a drought
[2:01:17] what anything to me i don't live here
[2:01:20] but i could see the animals
[2:01:23] the trees and how your
[2:01:25] your foundations of your house you were
[2:01:26] even having to you know wet them and
[2:01:28] keep it from cracking and all these
[2:01:29] things well you know that costs money
[2:01:31] and that that involves all of us because
[2:01:33] we all live in a house i hope
[2:01:37] but jim and i lived in a barn for a
[2:01:39] little while but that's okay
[2:01:42] but
[2:01:43] that was what came on my heart was that
[2:01:44] you were suffering
[2:01:46] and if you're god's kids
[2:01:51] what more dad would go no i don't think
[2:01:53] i'm gonna help them i think i'll just
[2:01:54] let them know he wants to help everybody
[2:01:57] and that just struck in my heart and
[2:01:59] that prayer like i said i just prayed
[2:02:00] that one prayer and i said lord it's
[2:02:01] gonna you know just it'll happen
[2:02:04] but you had to believe it too
[2:02:07] and you got your reign that's right and
[2:02:09] you got an abundance of rain but it
[2:02:10] didn't kill nobody
[2:02:12] well y'all everybody's okay so
[2:02:14] but you know what do that same thing for
[2:02:16] your kids
[2:02:18] do that same thing for your husband
[2:02:19] that's not a believer for a wife is not
[2:02:21] a believer saying that same
[2:02:23] that same thing that comes in and says i
[2:02:27] am so burdened
[2:02:29] you ever get a burden for somebody wake
[2:02:30] up in the middle of night
[2:02:32] you know what you better pray for that
[2:02:34] person
[2:02:35] you say well why do i need to pray for
[2:02:37] that person he's got the holy ghost god
[2:02:39] don't work that way
[2:02:42] if we'll realize one thing
[2:02:44] god wants you to be god
[2:02:49] god wants you to be god
[2:02:52] he knows he's god
[2:02:54] he wants you to be god
[2:03:00] that's something to chew on
[2:03:03] because remember adam had control of the
[2:03:05] whole earth
[2:03:08] and that's what you were going to have
[2:03:09] if you would have come without a fault
[2:03:12] didn't like that tree you could just do
[2:03:13] that in the tree and move over
[2:03:16] come on now
[2:03:18] be wonderful now if you could do that
[2:03:21] go to a restaurant and be full and go
[2:03:24] you know
[2:03:26] but you know god's not that carnal i'm
[2:03:27] just making a joke but still though it's
[2:03:29] the desire of your heart
[2:03:31] right you ever seen god come to the
[2:03:32] desire of your heart and just give you
[2:03:34] that but you know sometimes he says no
[2:03:36] well that's the best yes did anybody
[2:03:38] ever said that before
[2:03:40] that's the best yes yeah that's the best
[2:03:42] yes god i ever give you is to say no
[2:03:44] that i don't think that's gonna work you
[2:03:46] may think it will but it's not gonna
[2:03:47] work i promise trust me it's not gonna
[2:03:49] work i've already seen it happen but see
[2:03:51] we take the will of god
[2:03:54] and just become a group of people that
[2:03:56] just
[2:03:57] binds together and and if one's got a
[2:04:00] need
[2:04:01] you know you you don't have to make
[2:04:02] needs known all the time i i can feel
[2:04:05] needs for my congregation i know people
[2:04:06] when people are struggling you don't
[2:04:08] have to have discernment you can
[2:04:10] understand by conversation and by the
[2:04:12] way they act and stuff so you know be
[2:04:14] aware what i'm saying is be aware god
[2:04:16] wants you to be god
[2:04:18] he wants you to be able to handle things
[2:04:21] we got a big god he can handle
[2:04:22] everything but he wants but why did he
[2:04:23] wake
[2:04:24] me up to pray for brother bud
[2:04:28] he wanted a connection there god wanted
[2:04:30] me to he god want he want to go
[2:04:33] you got something to do with this
[2:04:35] why does he put a preacher up here why
[2:04:37] don't y'all just sit home
[2:04:40] you got the you got the quotes just like
[2:04:41] we do
[2:04:42] you got to buy am i got a bible at home
[2:04:46] or a knife or an ipad
[2:04:48] you know this thing doesn't need
[2:04:49] batteries
[2:04:53] just kidding
[2:04:55] i'll have one sooner or later
[2:04:56] but i like this one because the
[2:04:57] batteries don't run out
[2:04:59] you can flip the pages
[2:05:01] but everybody's got that why do we need
[2:05:02] to come to church
[2:05:05] that's what he said in here
[2:05:07] we need to assemble ourselves together
[2:05:10] and more so
[2:05:12] and more so a lot of people don't think
[2:05:13] the day's approaching i guess
[2:05:15] because he said more so
[2:05:17] as the day approaches lord bless each
[2:05:19] and every one of you we love you with
[2:05:20] the love of the lord pray for us we'll
[2:05:22] be leaving tomorrow about four o'clock
[2:05:24] and uh
[2:05:25] maybe we'll get back here before the end
[2:05:26] of the year who knows i think we're
[2:05:28] going to do something brother claude's
[2:05:29] the end of the year in december so we'll
[2:05:30] see
[2:05:31] but uh love you man appreciate you
[2:05:33] appreciate you man
[2:05:35] appreciate all of you
[2:05:36] amen
[2:05:40] well you're not going to have to he said
[2:05:41] chew on this he's uh we're sharing a
[2:05:44] a statement about god wants you to be
[2:05:45] god you're not going to have to chew on
[2:05:46] it alone because that's our subject for
[2:05:49] wednesday night if we've been talking
[2:05:50] about equality for quite a while and so
[2:05:52] we'll get back into psalms
[2:05:53] psalms 82 where god standeth in the
[2:05:55] congregation of the
[2:05:57] gods and judgeth among the elohim so uh
[2:06:01] right there in the scripture
[2:06:02] let me just say this i know it's a
[2:06:03] little bit late but let me just say this
[2:06:04] one thing
[2:06:06] brother bannon for 16 years of the
[2:06:07] opening of the seals
[2:06:09] i believe his um
[2:06:12] the theme of brother adam's ministry was
[2:06:13] predestination
[2:06:15] it really was because he laid into it
[2:06:17] over and over and over there are perhaps
[2:06:19] more religious volumes of doctrine
[2:06:22] that have been written
[2:06:24] and more sermons on predestination than
[2:06:25] perhaps anything else
[2:06:27] among the religious world and so there
[2:06:30] are just there's so many ways you can go
[2:06:33] but it and i understand why brother
[2:06:35] branham said predestination is not a
[2:06:36] good word
[2:06:37] he's not saying it like stay away from
[2:06:40] it but it's not a good word to use in a
[2:06:43] congregation like he said of the
[2:06:44] untrained
[2:06:46] see because that's just part of the
[2:06:48] equation
[2:06:49] one of the most
[2:06:51] familiar scriptures among all of us is
[2:06:53] romans 8 28.
[2:06:55] all things work together for good
[2:06:58] uh to them that love the lord now watch
[2:07:00] and are called that's part of it
[2:07:03] according to his purpose
[2:07:05] that's a part of it then he goes down to
[2:07:07] verse 29 it says for assume he for whom
[2:07:09] he has foreknown that's the third part
[2:07:11] he hath predestinated that's the fourth
[2:07:13] part
[2:07:14] to be conformed
[2:07:17] to the image
[2:07:18] of his son and that's what we're talking
[2:07:20] about so you got four parts there then
[2:07:22] he goes on in verse 30 it says for whom
[2:07:24] he has predestinated he's also justified
[2:07:27] there's the fifth part
[2:07:29] and then for whom he has justified then
[2:07:31] he is also glorified so there's the
[2:07:33] sixth part
[2:07:35] so it's one it's it's one enormous
[2:07:37] subject and there's just no way
[2:07:39] you can in an hour hour and a half
[2:07:42] give
[2:07:43] really
[2:07:44] any uh
[2:07:46] uh
[2:07:48] well what's the word i'm looking for and
[2:07:50] it works to cover it all you can touch
[2:07:51] this and that and this and that and this
[2:07:53] and that and then try to try to make it
[2:07:55] connect
[2:07:56] and in your notes in your mind you know
[2:07:58] you're connecting it all but you've been
[2:07:59] preaching on it your dad's been how long
[2:08:01] on it
[2:08:02] all right eight sermon and he probably
[2:08:03] just now getting into it didn't he
[2:08:05] they probably just
[2:08:06] they just got see so you can take it and
[2:08:08] go
[2:08:09] just forever on it you really can and
[2:08:11] it's just a huge huge subject and so we
[2:08:13] may comment
[2:08:14] uh on some of those things wednesday
[2:08:16] night as we incorporate it into
[2:08:18] uh our continuing
[2:08:21] series on equality but
[2:08:23] i appreciate the truth of the word i
[2:08:25] appreciate brother
[2:08:26] delivering his soul to us today
[2:08:29] and so we're thankful for that
[2:08:31] amen let's bow our heads just in a word
[2:08:33] of prayer as we dismiss today father
[2:08:36] um
[2:08:37] we're thankful for the truth
[2:08:40] of the uh
[2:08:43] predestination that as we understand it
[2:08:45] as has been brought to us and
[2:08:47] and cleared up for us by the prophet of
[2:08:49] god and so
[2:08:50] help us now just to go forth from here
[2:08:52] and meditate upon these things and give
[2:08:54] consideration lord to the things that
[2:08:55] were said and
[2:08:57] may it uh continue to strengthen us and
[2:09:00] to aid us and to help us in this
[2:09:03] uh journey from our birth to a body
[2:09:05] change lord so as we're dismissed today
[2:09:07] may the
[2:09:09] may the uh spirit of the lord be with us
[2:09:11] and upon us
[2:09:13] and keep us in the center of your will
[2:09:14] as we go we'll ask in the name of the
[2:09:16] lord jesus christ all of god's people
[2:09:18] said amen god bless you may be
[2:09:21] dismissed
[2:09:22] uh normally i'd say let's
[2:09:24] continue singing but we haven't even
[2:09:26] sung have we
[2:09:27] but that's all right you know david sang
[2:09:29] psalms and it turned out to be
[2:09:31] scriptures
[2:09:32] and so i guess brother wade could have
[2:09:34] sang the scriptures that he read and it
[2:09:36] would have been just as valid
[2:09:38] amen because all the scripture is is uh
[2:09:40] all the psalms are is
[2:09:42] it just uh
[2:09:43] words with tunes to it so amen
[2:09:47] let god uh
[2:09:49] let god fill your heart with the psalms
[2:09:51] and the
[2:09:52] and uh the word of the air god bless you
[2:09:54] is your dismiss
[2:09:56] take the name of jesus with you as you
[2:09:58] go god bless
[2:10:31] you
