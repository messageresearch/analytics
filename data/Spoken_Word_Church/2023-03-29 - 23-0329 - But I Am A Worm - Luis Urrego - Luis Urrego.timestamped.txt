[8:56] Psalms chapter 22 22.
[8:59] this evening
[9:02] Psalms chapter 22.
[9:05] appreciate that song sister Lily enjoyed
[9:08] that I was looking over there at the uh
[9:10] you know I made that those calendars
[9:12] back in December now I didn't know when
[9:14] Esther was going to get married so
[9:17] so that's why Esther was on the uh on
[9:20] the calendar there I was like I looked
[9:23] at it I was like oh you know
[9:25] we're gonna miss her
[9:27] it won't be the same but but we're just
[9:30] trusting that she will uh she'll have a
[9:33] wonderful life from here on out amen a
[9:36] new a new stage in life amen and you a
[9:40] new a new era or a new time in her life
[9:44] amen Psalms chapter 22.
[9:47] let's start at verse one
[9:51] it says my God my God why hast Thou
[9:53] forsaken me why art thou so far from
[9:57] helping me and from the words of my
[10:00] roaring oh my God I cry in the daytime
[10:03] but thou hears not and in the ninth
[10:06] season and I'm not silent but Thou Art
[10:09] holy oh thou that inhabitants the
[10:12] Praises of Israel
[10:13] our fathers trusted in thee they trusted
[10:16] and thou didst delivered them they Cried
[10:19] unto thee and were delivered they
[10:22] trusted in thee and were not confounded
[10:25] but I am a worm and no man
[10:29] a reproach of man and despised of the
[10:32] people all they that see me laugh me to
[10:36] scorn they shoot out the lip they shake
[10:39] the head saying he trusted on the Lord
[10:42] that he would deliver him let him
[10:45] deliver him seeing he delighteth in him
[10:48] does that sound like a scripture you've
[10:49] read somewhere else
[10:53] but Thou Art he that took me out of the
[10:55] womb thou didst make me hope when I was
[10:57] upon my mother's breasts I was cast upon
[11:00] thee from the womb Thou Art my God from
[11:02] my mother's belly last verse here be not
[11:05] far from me for trouble is near for
[11:07] there is none to help praise the Lord
[11:10] you may be seated this evening
[11:12] amen
[11:15] amen I want to I want to take a little
[11:17] topic tonight and I want to call it but
[11:20] I am a worm
[11:22] and I'm taking it from verse six
[11:24] and uh
[11:26] I did a Sunday school lesson about this
[11:28] a couple of years ago
[11:30] where I talked about where I talked
[11:32] about Jesus being a worm
[11:34] so we're kind of revisiting this but I I
[11:37] wanna I wanna I wanna I know there was a
[11:39] lot of there were there weren't a lot of
[11:40] people that there at the time that are
[11:43] here tonight and there's some new ones
[11:45] listening in so I figure since being at
[11:47] it's Easter time we we will revisit this
[11:50] but I want to take a look at uh at
[11:53] different aspects of Psalms chapter 22
[11:55] because when we look at Psalms chapter
[11:57] 22 here it correlates perfectly with the
[12:01] crucifixion of the Lord Jesus Christ we
[12:04] know that it was David amen it was
[12:07] Christ speaking through David amen when
[12:10] David was saying these things even at
[12:13] that time at this time from According to
[12:15] the history and the things that I that I
[12:17] that I looked at there was no such thing
[12:19] as a crucifixion as punishment of
[12:22] crucifixion at the time that didn't come
[12:24] until years later and the Romans were
[12:27] the ones who ended up perfecting that
[12:28] hence the reason why it was the Romans
[12:31] that crucified Jesus
[12:33] and so we see here David speaking about
[12:36] him and we know that David he had a lot
[12:39] of problems in life we know he was
[12:40] chased by by his by his brother Absalon
[12:43] I'm in his son Absalon and uh he had
[12:47] different things he was dethroned and
[12:50] and multiple things happened in his life
[12:52] but never do we see in the history of
[12:55] the things that David went through where
[12:57] he was actually pierced in his hands or
[12:59] pierced through his feet and and the
[13:03] different things that he says here and
[13:05] so we know that brother Brandon even
[13:06] said that he David was actually a
[13:08] prophet
[13:09] and so as he was speaking here because
[13:12] we can see here that this when we when
[13:14] we look at the beginning it says to the
[13:15] chief musician upon agile shehar a Psalm
[13:19] of David
[13:21] it was David amen speaking by
[13:23] inspiration whoever was writing this
[13:25] down panning this down was seeing
[13:27] something
[13:28] that was not even going to take place
[13:30] till years hundreds of years later
[13:33] and so we look at here
[13:35] it starts with my God my God why has
[13:39] Thou forsaken me and we know that this
[13:42] is exactly what Jesus said when he was
[13:44] upon the cross and he said Eli Eli
[13:47] sabatani which means my God my God why
[13:51] has Thou forsaken me he was actually
[13:53] quoting Psalms chapter 22.
[13:56] amen we might he might have been quoting
[14:00] and he might have been saying uh uh
[14:02] saying Psalms 22 in his head amen but if
[14:06] you read if you just take a look at this
[14:09] whole chapter
[14:10] I mean it speaks almost as as more
[14:14] detailed about the crucifixion of Christ
[14:16] than even the gospels do so
[14:18] amen because of the things that he was
[14:20] suffering and yet you think that it was
[14:22] David but we know David was having
[14:24] troubles but it was it wasn't David it
[14:26] was David amen experiencing or seeing
[14:30] someone amen that was uh that was
[14:33] experiencing this and we know that it
[14:34] was Christ amen and he says my God my
[14:37] God why has Thou forsaken me why are
[14:39] thou so far from helping me and from the
[14:42] words of my roaring amen you can imagine
[14:45] Jesus Christ amen everybody had forsaken
[14:48] him at that time
[14:50] I mean Judas forsook him the disciples
[14:53] forsook him everybody had forsaken him
[14:56] and so now he's he's probably in his
[14:58] mind he's when Jesus is there dine upon
[15:01] the cross he's probably thinking
[15:03] also you Lord
[15:05] you forsaking me
[15:07] you see because he we know that Jesus
[15:09] was God but we know that that that he
[15:12] also was suffering as a human as well
[15:14] as a son to be an example for us you see
[15:18] and so he's he's crying out and he's
[15:21] saying my God my God why has Thou
[15:23] forsaken me because he's he knew that
[15:25] the Lord was always with him
[15:28] I mean and he didn't do nothing unless
[15:31] the father showed him first
[15:33] so we knew that that that God was always
[15:37] with him the father was always with him
[15:39] but here comes this instance where he is
[15:41] he's abandoning him and it's because
[15:43] Jesus became sin for us amen
[15:46] he wasn't a sinner
[15:48] [Laughter]
[15:49] he became sin for us
[15:52] amen and anything that that that is
[15:55] sinful amen
[15:57] God can't look at sin
[15:59] God can't can't see that God can't see
[16:02] that and therefore that's one of the
[16:03] reasons why amen he felt that his God
[16:06] was forsaken him because he was taking
[16:08] your sin and my sin
[16:10] remember as the song goes when he was on
[16:13] the cross I was on his mind
[16:16] and so it takes us back to
[16:18] predestination amen because it was God
[16:20] Amen he he foreknew you even before the
[16:23] foundation of the world right
[16:25] right so he for news amen and even and
[16:28] when he was dying on the cross amen he
[16:30] was doing it not for himself he was
[16:32] doing it for you and me
[16:35] and for and the Bible says that that for
[16:37] for many as would receive him to them
[16:40] gave me power to become the sons of God
[16:42] Amen
[16:43] and so he continues saying here David
[16:45] continue saying here oh my God I cry in
[16:48] the daytime but thou here is not
[16:50] can you imagine amen getting to a point
[16:52] where God is not hearing you anymore
[16:56] where you were used to at one point in
[16:59] time God you would pray God would hear
[17:01] you amen Lazarus come forth
[17:07] amen but here is an instance where Jesus
[17:10] remember this is Jesus fulfilling this
[17:13] Jesus comes to a point where he was
[17:16] saying my God why has thou forsaken me
[17:18] why don't you hear me
[17:20] and you know sometimes we get to a point
[17:22] like that David was was in situations
[17:24] like that you see where it feels like
[17:26] the Lord's not hearing our prayers it
[17:29] feels like those dry moments in our life
[17:32] like where is God
[17:34] where is where where is he I've been
[17:36] serving him for 30 40 years I go to
[17:39] church I pay my tithes I do what I'm
[17:42] supposed to do I'm nice to everybody I
[17:45] smile I shake I don't fall asleep at
[17:47] church I do everything that is great and
[17:49] I feel like God is not hearing me
[17:54] yep
[17:55] if it happened to Jesus how much more us
[17:59] you see
[18:01] but see God has a reason why he allows
[18:03] those things for in our lives amen
[18:06] because he knows he can get something
[18:07] better out of that amen again as I know
[18:10] I've been saying it lately a lot and God
[18:13] cannot come right as sometimes he might
[18:16] sometimes he will but not every time you
[18:19] call on to him that he he he he has to
[18:21] do it right there and then
[18:23] amen
[18:25] amen because we don't learn patience
[18:27] that way
[18:28] we don't learn how to wait and we don't
[18:30] learn Amen to trust in him
[18:33] to trust in his word
[18:36] oh it's hard
[18:38] don't you think it was hard for Jesus
[18:39] don't you think it was hard for David
[18:41] when he was whatever he was expressing
[18:43] here whatever was going on in his life
[18:45] so many some say that this was during
[18:48] the time when maybe Absalom was chasing
[18:50] him I don't know but obviously we know
[18:52] that David went through some difficult
[18:54] times in his life where he felt like God
[18:57] was not hearing him
[19:02] and how much more us
[19:04] it feels like God but he promised that
[19:07] he would never leave us
[19:09] nor forsake us
[19:11] amen so if he's if he promised that he
[19:14] would never leave us nor forsake us then
[19:17] that means he that he is listening
[19:20] to your prayer
[19:23] he just wants to answer it in his time
[19:27] praise the Lord Jesus
[19:28] oh my God I cry in the daytime but thou
[19:31] here is not and in the night season and
[19:34] then and am not silent
[19:37] verse 3 but Thou Art holy oh that thou
[19:40] inhabitants the Praises of Israel amen
[19:42] so even though God was not hearing David
[19:44] amen he still goes ahead and worships
[19:46] him
[19:48] do you inhabit the Praises Lord Jesus Oh
[19:51] I may not have it right now I may not
[19:53] get it right at this very moment but
[19:54] Lord I praise you anyhow
[19:56] Lord you inhabit my Praises you you you
[19:58] deserve all my praise and all my glory
[20:01] amen in your time lord Jesus
[20:04] praise the Lord but Thou Art holy oh
[20:07] thou that inhabitants the Praises of
[20:09] Israel our fathers trusted indeed verse
[20:11] 4 they trusted and thou didst deliver
[20:13] them they Cried unto thee and were
[20:16] delivered he's bringing now David
[20:18] speaking about the things that God had
[20:20] done for them in the past and were
[20:23] delivered they trusted indeed and were
[20:25] not confounded
[20:27] amen you will not be confounded when you
[20:30] put your whole trust in the Lord
[20:32] amen
[20:35] because he will never let you down
[20:38] young people he won't ever let you down
[20:41] amen when you get to a point in life
[20:43] amen where it's confusion and I know
[20:45] some of you are in ages where it's it's
[20:47] confusing where should I do what should
[20:49] I what should I believe what should I
[20:51] amen
[20:53] stay with what you what what you know
[20:55] what you have learned already
[20:57] stay with that and maybe maybe you may
[21:00] not understand it fully but stay with it
[21:02] and eventually eventually it will come
[21:05] to fruition
[21:06] right keep adding more more water on top
[21:09] of that and what is water water is the
[21:12] word
[21:13] keep adding more word to that word that
[21:15] you already heard
[21:17] that rhymes almost
[21:19] but keep adding more word to that word
[21:22] that you already heard and eventually
[21:24] that word is gonna
[21:26] bring something amen a reality a true
[21:29] experience in your life
[21:31] amen amen
[21:33] oh I know it's confusing yeah I was I
[21:36] was 13 at one time I was 14. I was 15 I
[21:40] was 16.
[21:41] right
[21:42] it's a bit confusing it's it's times of
[21:45] confusion I understand many changes and
[21:48] different things taking place but God
[21:50] promised amen that he would lead us and
[21:52] guide us
[21:53] unto all truth just stay with what you
[21:55] already have
[21:56] amen stay with what you already have and
[21:59] just move on with that
[22:01] and then let God just keep feeding that
[22:03] and let God Amen that will continue to
[22:06] grow it's just like a tree amen a tree
[22:09] ain't gonna grow any other way unless
[22:10] you give it water and and sunlight
[22:14] give it water and sunlight give it word
[22:16] and church word in church word in church
[22:19] eventually you will grow
[22:21] eventually you will get to a point amen
[22:24] word on top of word
[22:26] and I always say you know that that that
[22:28] that you know we all need showers right
[22:32] we all need to take a shower right
[22:35] so when you need when you take a shower
[22:37] I hope that you use soap
[22:41] because you know you can take a shower
[22:43] with just water and really you don't
[22:46] really come out really that clean
[22:48] you still come out greasy
[22:49] [Laughter]
[22:53] right I'm just I'm just being honest
[22:56] you need to have some soap some some
[22:59] some some lathering up I always say that
[23:02] soap is kind of like the fivefold
[23:03] ministry
[23:04] amen kind of scrub you down a little bit
[23:07] but you still need that water in there
[23:08] to gonna go ahead and wash that out
[23:10] right
[23:11] and the soap won't work unless there's
[23:13] water the soap won't work unless there's
[23:15] there's there's there's there's there's
[23:16] there's there's there's
[23:17] word there
[23:19] right
[23:20] so this is not the soap that does it
[23:23] just the soap it needs the water as well
[23:25] in order to be to get fully clean right
[23:27] I like that I like using that analogy
[23:30] hey man so we need a five-fold Ministry
[23:32] amen we need the word
[23:35] amen and they both work together to help
[23:37] you get to a point where where you need
[23:39] to get to perfect
[23:41] the bride Amen to perfect his people to
[23:44] clean you up
[23:46] amen that's a good shower right there
[23:49] man uh when I'm in Nicaragua or Honduras
[23:52] say man and that's it you know it's
[23:54] sweaty it's hot in those places I gotta
[23:57] have me some soap
[23:59] ain't that right Nyla
[24:02] I gotta have me some so I gotta have me
[24:04] some shampoo
[24:05] right yeah that's when you that's when
[24:07] you feel clean
[24:09] all right all right let's get back to
[24:11] this
[24:12] got you all smiling there for a moment
[24:16] so David continues here our fathers
[24:18] trusted indeed they trusted and thou did
[24:20] US delivered them verse five they Cried
[24:22] unto them were delivered they trusted in
[24:25] thee and were not confounded now this is
[24:27] where I want to get to Amen to verse six
[24:29] and he says here something very strange
[24:32] and remember this is David this is
[24:34] Christ speaking through David right and
[24:38] he says here he says but I am a worm
[24:42] and no man
[24:44] what is he talking about amen
[24:47] but I am a worm you know why didn't he
[24:50] say we know that that a worm is is the
[24:53] lowest uh it's one of the lowest little
[24:55] creatures that that you could possibly
[24:57] you know a little earthworm right you
[25:00] see him probably on the side of the road
[25:01] dead sometimes after a rain you know
[25:03] they're and they harden up and stuff and
[25:05] they get it's nasty
[25:07] but it's the lowest of the lowest but
[25:10] why did did God why did David not say
[25:14] there I I you know but I am a roach
[25:17] I mean the roaches are just as nasty
[25:20] I mean I don't like roaches
[25:23] where I am something else I am I am I'm
[25:25] this but he he said here I am a worm
[25:29] now when he says this here he's not
[25:31] speaking about a worm like you and me
[25:33] think a worm is right
[25:36] so so so this is where I want to get it
[25:38] the brothers could bring up the uh the
[25:40] the
[25:41] my my my thing here
[25:44] my connection
[25:45] I got some slides here I wanna
[25:48] show
[25:55] maybe we can try again
[26:06] all right
[26:11] let me try this one here
[26:13] not showing
[26:19] how about this right here
[26:39] all right something's coming up
[26:44] all right
[26:48] okay
[26:55] can you see that all right
[26:57] okay all right so in Matthew chapter 27
[27:00] verse verse 46 we see there that
[27:04] and Jesus and this is when Jesus was
[27:06] dying and about the ninth hour Jesus
[27:08] cried with a loud voice saying that
[27:10] is to say my God my God why has Thou
[27:13] forsaken me and so we've we're there at
[27:15] verse six now brother Branham says this
[27:18] he says this and look the scripture had
[27:21] said that was going to happen exactly
[27:23] word by word the way it was even David
[27:26] hundreds of years before that about 800
[27:29] years cried the very same thing that he
[27:31] said on the cross
[27:33] all right and no doubt that in the
[27:36] temple that morning think about this
[27:37] right here no doubt that in the temple
[27:39] that morning they might have sang that
[27:41] same song Psalms chapter 22 my God my
[27:44] God why has Thou forsaken me in the
[27:47] temple singing about it and the god that
[27:49] they claimed they served they were
[27:51] crucifying
[27:53] think about that
[27:55] if you're going to be doing you can be
[27:57] doing a service for God and thinking
[27:59] that you uh are are are you know just
[28:03] doing what you're supposed to do
[28:06] in reality it not be the will of God
[28:10] remember brother Brandon said you know
[28:13] doing God of service without it being
[28:15] his will
[28:16] we can be so busy for God sometimes and
[28:18] then it not really be his will
[28:21] amen
[28:23] so we see that this scripture is talking
[28:25] about Christ and and and so that's the
[28:28] question we were asking why does he call
[28:30] himself a a worm amen
[28:33] now
[28:35] in in Job chapter 25 verse 3 it says
[28:38] this is there any number of in of his
[28:41] armies and upon whom doth not his light
[28:43] arise how then can man be justified with
[28:46] God or how can he be clean that is born
[28:48] of a woman behold even to the moon and
[28:51] it shineth not yea the stars are not
[28:53] pure in his sight
[28:54] says here how much less man that that is
[28:58] a worm
[28:59] and the son of man which is a worm
[29:03] so they're referring to that that worm
[29:06] here and it's interesting that it's also
[29:08] verse six as well just like verse 6 and
[29:10] Psalms chapter 22. now the word the word
[29:13] scarlet is used several times in the
[29:15] scriptures amen uh for example we know
[29:18] about the Scarlet thread that that that
[29:20] that that the
[29:22] um
[29:23] Rahab brought down when when when she uh
[29:27] when the children of Israel were to take
[29:29] the the Jericho and so uh that speaks of
[29:33] scarlet and so when you ever whenever
[29:35] you look at that word scarlet in the
[29:37] Hebrew lexicon the word or the word
[29:39] Crimson right which rep which means red
[29:41] it's the word Shani or Shani which means
[29:45] this
[29:46] Scarlet Crimson properly it says
[29:48] properly the insect caucus alysses
[29:52] which is the dried body of the female
[29:54] yielding coloring matter from which has
[29:56] made the dye used for cloth to color
[29:59] crimson Scarlet or Crimson all right so
[30:04] it's referring to a a worm and an animal
[30:07] that word where whenever you see it the
[30:10] meaning of the word scarlet goes hand in
[30:12] hand with the meaning of the word
[30:14] Crimson in the Hebrew lexicon and you
[30:17] see this here in Isaiah chapter 1 verse
[30:19] 8 18 which says come now and let us
[30:22] reason together saith the Lord though
[30:24] your sins be as Scarlet
[30:27] they shall be as white as snow though
[30:29] they be red like Crimson they shall be
[30:31] as wool praise the Lord Jesus
[30:34] amen thank God Amen that our sins that
[30:38] they're not just
[30:39] covered they're washed they're done away
[30:43] with if you've truly repented of your
[30:45] sins if you've truly asked God to
[30:47] forgive me he just doesn't put a
[30:49] covering over because when there's a
[30:51] covering over something if I put a
[30:53] covering over this Pulpit that doesn't
[30:54] mean the pulpit is not there anymore the
[30:57] pulpit is still there it's just under a
[30:59] covering right but when God Amen takes
[31:02] care of your sins he eradicates them
[31:04] completely amen so what that's the power
[31:07] of the blood of Jesus Christ amen we
[31:10] know that it's the literal blood
[31:12] wouldn't be able to do anything for you
[31:14] right but we know it's the spirit behind
[31:17] the under the under the blood amen that
[31:20] that that's what does the power praise
[31:22] the Lord Brother Brandon said that you
[31:23] can have the the blood of Jesus Christ a
[31:25] gallon of blood here and just pour it
[31:28] all over you of the the literal blood of
[31:30] Jesus Christ and as and as reverently
[31:33] and as as as we would try to make sure
[31:36] it won't spill but you can go ahead and
[31:37] pour that on you and it wouldn't do
[31:39] anything for you
[31:41] it's the spirit amen behind under that
[31:43] blood
[31:45] that cover that not just covers but
[31:47] takes away your sin eradicates your sin
[31:50] so that word there is Scarlet in the in
[31:53] in in Isaiah is the word Tola and it and
[31:56] and and and watch what this word means
[31:58] it means worms scar Scarlet stuff
[32:00] Crimson worm it goes back and it says
[32:03] the female caucus alysses
[32:06] Scarlet stuff Crimson Scarlet the dye
[32:10] made from the dried body of the female
[32:12] of the worm caucus alysses a worm maggot
[32:16] worm grub the worm caucus alysses
[32:21] so that's very interesting that that is
[32:23] the same word that is referring back to
[32:25] Psalms chapter 22 verse 6 where David
[32:29] says I am a worm
[32:31] but we know that it was Christ speaking
[32:32] through David right
[32:34] praise the Lord Jesus
[32:38] so this word Tola is the same word used
[32:41] for the word or the word worm in Exodus
[32:43] chapter 16 when they were talking about
[32:45] that if they left the Manna out
[32:48] you know too long if bread worms is the
[32:51] same word there Tola
[32:54] um and made it stink so the general
[32:56] Hebrew word in the Bible for worm is
[32:58] Rima which means a maggot or a common
[33:00] Worm but the word that was used in
[33:03] Psalms chapter 22 to describe Jesus was
[33:05] Tola or Tola off which is the same word
[33:08] in Hebrew for the word Crimson or
[33:10] Scarlet amen trying to go so trying to
[33:13] go a little quicker here so are you are
[33:16] you all following me yeah all right all
[33:18] right so
[33:20] this is very interesting because when a
[33:22] couple of years ago when I was looking
[33:23] into this
[33:25] um I was looking actually at the token
[33:29] and then I got into looking into it and
[33:31] then I got into reading this and then
[33:33] and then I started looking into that why
[33:35] why is it that he says I'm a worm and
[33:37] got to look into it and here we are
[33:41] but but I believe saints that that God
[33:44] doesn't put things in the word just to
[33:46] put him there
[33:47] and if you truly believe that the word
[33:49] of God is inspired by God then they're
[33:52] there for a purpose
[33:54] they have a purpose and as I said God
[33:57] said what he said and he meant what he
[33:59] said
[34:00] right they're there for a reason it's
[34:03] just up to you and me Amen to take and
[34:06] dig into them
[34:07] and see what he meant right
[34:10] amen praise the Lord
[34:11] because it's all beneficial for us it's
[34:14] all beneficial for us so
[34:16] in looking at this at this at this worm
[34:18] it's it's interesting I know you you
[34:20] probably some of you can't read that
[34:21] text there but I'll just read it for you
[34:23] the the dry bodies of the females uh uh
[34:26] uh
[34:27] of a scale insect or the caucus alysses
[34:30] uh Allied to the coquine insect and
[34:33] found on several species of Oak near the
[34:35] Mediterranean and old and old Israel so
[34:37] this worm that David is referring to
[34:40] here is is found in Israel in those
[34:42] Mediterranean areas in ancient days the
[34:45] dead bodies of the female crimson worms
[34:47] were scraped from the tree and I'm going
[34:49] to show you some pictures here in just a
[34:50] moment dried and then ground into a
[34:53] powder that was used to dye their cloth
[34:55] and garments as Scarlet or red color
[34:57] they're about the size of a little pea
[35:00] that's how that's how big these are and
[35:03] when the crushed worm was also used to
[35:05] make medicine that helps the heart beat
[35:07] smoothly think about that
[35:10] very interesting and then later on we're
[35:13] going to see that their bodies turn into
[35:14] a white wax that's used to make shellac
[35:16] which is a preservative of wood so
[35:18] there's the picture right there of that
[35:20] of that worm right there the caucus
[35:22] elysius or the Scarlet worm in other
[35:25] words
[35:26] now some of these they're a little older
[35:28] but uh
[35:29] you can see they're not 4K or HD
[35:35] all right
[35:36] this right here this is a
[35:39] an older picture that this is a
[35:42] uh from the temple Institute they're in
[35:46] Israel they were showing a demonstration
[35:47] of this little worm and and and and and
[35:50] he's going to show uh
[35:54] he's take he take he's got boiled water
[35:56] here
[35:57] and he's take he takes one little worm
[35:59] one little worm like that one of those
[36:01] little pea-sized worms and he and he
[36:04] dissolves it
[36:05] inside the
[36:09] and you see how red it's turning
[36:16] all right now remember what represents
[36:18] red crimson
[36:20] the blood
[36:22] right
[36:25] and you see and that's just one one
[36:27] little one little worm that does that
[36:29] right there
[36:31] yeah and they would use that
[36:33] this is an example of some some thread
[36:35] that they that they've died with that
[36:37] with that worm you can go on YouTube
[36:39] right now and you can search uh videos
[36:42] of people actually dying uh using this
[36:45] little worm and dying threads and things
[36:48] with with the dial this little worm this
[36:50] was the same dye that the priests used
[36:53] to use to dye their their garments in
[36:56] the Old Testament and also the the the
[36:59] coverings that were used for the
[37:00] Tabernacle as well
[37:02] so and this is right here this is
[37:05] they're they're going out and Gathering
[37:07] the little worm out there
[37:10] and they're taking it
[37:13] and and it and it latches onto the tree
[37:16] so it kind of looks like it's part of
[37:17] the tree
[37:18] but that actually has a representation
[37:23] and so this is what it this is what it
[37:25] looks like right now those or those
[37:27] right there those actually have eggs
[37:30] under them
[37:31] and so they uh their babies under there
[37:35] and so they they formed this hard shell
[37:38] and so this is right here this is when
[37:40] after they have ripped them off the tree
[37:42] and you can see those are eggs inside
[37:47] and there's a little closer shot with
[37:49] them now they take these this right here
[37:51] they crush them and then they they color
[37:53] dye they they use it for for coloring
[37:56] all right
[37:57] so
[37:58] what does what does all this talking
[38:00] about worms have to do with Jesus and
[38:02] Easter
[38:03] all right
[38:05] he says here but I am a worm and no man
[38:07] a reproach of man and despised of the
[38:10] people
[38:11] amen
[38:12] many many people we know despise Jesus
[38:15] Christ
[38:17] many people despise Jesus Christ today
[38:20] you know they don't even want to hear
[38:22] his name on TV
[38:25] and I've I've watched little clips of of
[38:27] newscasts where where where uh
[38:30] compilations of newscasts like Fox News
[38:33] and CNN and different things and there's
[38:36] somebody there talking about Jesus and
[38:38] how with their thanking Jesus for this
[38:40] that or the other and as soon as as soon
[38:42] as they they cut the feet off multiple
[38:46] times has happened
[38:48] they they they cut the feet off you
[38:50] can't tell me that's coincidence they
[38:52] don't want to hear the word of the word
[38:54] Jesus
[38:55] they don't want they don't want
[38:57] Christianity to be propagated
[38:59] they do anything to stop it
[39:02] and so
[39:04] um
[39:04] I think lately uh I don't I don't I
[39:08] haven't looked too much into it but
[39:10] in in Israel they're they're saying that
[39:13] they don't even want people to preach
[39:15] Jesus there in Israel
[39:18] so I don't I don't know how how where
[39:21] that's going to go but we just know that
[39:23] the world is heading to a place where
[39:25] they don't even want to hear they don't
[39:26] want to hear anything that you have to
[39:27] say about God
[39:29] anything about God
[39:32] no there's a people there's going to be
[39:34] faithful
[39:35] no matter what the word no what the
[39:37] world or how the world goes there is a
[39:39] people that's going to stay faithful to
[39:41] the word I'm not ashamed of this gospel
[39:43] you don't need to be ashamed of the word
[39:45] you don't need to be ashamed of the
[39:47] Gospel amen if this gospel amen will
[39:49] cause me to to to to go to my death will
[39:52] so be it my Lord did it for me amen why
[39:55] could not do it for him praise the Lord
[39:58] amen if it causes me to to suffer
[40:01] persecution will so be it
[40:03] it's worth it amen
[40:06] amen much more worth it than
[40:08] living in in this world in this present
[40:10] condition
[40:13] so to many people Jesus was irrelevant
[40:16] at that time you know
[40:17] Isaiah said that he had no Beauty in him
[40:20] that we should desire
[40:22] there was nothing beautiful about Jesus
[40:24] amen he he even looked older than what
[40:27] he was
[40:29] amen and so that's why David amen he
[40:32] says I am a worm
[40:35] Jesus speaking I am a worm
[40:37] you know you could go by walking by
[40:40] these trees they're in Israel and you
[40:42] would probably notice that there was a
[40:44] worm there on that tree or a little grub
[40:47] something insignificant but yet has so
[40:50] much power
[40:53] because one little worm amen can do a
[40:55] lot it could die the pre the garments
[40:58] the the garments of the priests
[41:01] if people just realize how much how much
[41:04] power is in the in the word amen in the
[41:06] Lord
[41:07] all right let's go a little quicker so
[41:09] just real quick amen and I'll just kind
[41:12] of paraphrase this when when this worm
[41:16] it comes time for her to have babies
[41:18] what she does is she goes and attaches
[41:21] herself to this tree
[41:23] to a tree and make sure that she doesn't
[41:26] she is she cannot be moved
[41:29] she attaches herself to that tree this
[41:32] is according to to the things I've read
[41:34] so I've kind of put it here a little bit
[41:35] some of it
[41:38] she attaches herself to the tree and she
[41:40] has her babies She lays the eggs and and
[41:43] so when When She lays the eggs she she
[41:46] makes she puts on this covering this
[41:49] hard covering or this hard shell around
[41:51] herself that's why that's why we saw it
[41:53] and it looked hard and kind of white
[41:55] looking that's the shell it's a
[41:57] protection and so when the when when the
[42:01] babies hatch and the eggs hatch they
[42:03] need to eat something right
[42:05] so according to what according to what I
[42:08] was reading they actually eat off this
[42:11] this grub
[42:12] this worm because there's nowhere else
[42:14] for it she can't she can't go and get
[42:17] food for them and they have no way to
[42:19] eat they have to eat so they start
[42:21] eating off the mom
[42:24] think about where that is
[42:27] amen we feed off the body word Jesus
[42:30] said I am the bread of life right
[42:33] I am the true bread that comes out of
[42:35] Heaven amen
[42:37] and and and and we get fed amen what
[42:40] feeds me is the word
[42:41] I can't really fully get fed off of
[42:44] anything else amen what truly feeds me
[42:46] amen my real me is the word of God
[42:49] other things are interesting other
[42:51] things are nice amen but what truly
[42:52] feeds the true Christian or the True
[42:54] Believer is the word of God Amen we have
[42:57] nowhere else to go Peter said where else
[42:59] can I go you are the only one that has
[43:01] the words of eternal life we are here
[43:03] under this shell of protection amen
[43:06] where else can we do and so these babies
[43:08] are there eating and they feed off the
[43:11] body word of their mom
[43:14] right praise the Lord Jesus and so as
[43:18] they're feeding amen and they get to a
[43:20] point the mom knows that they the the
[43:22] they're growing so she has to let them
[43:25] go
[43:26] right before she lets them go she she
[43:29] immediately covers them with this with
[43:31] this Crimson goo
[43:33] and this Crimson goo is it's in order to
[43:36] protect them amen
[43:39] it's the Crimson goo that protects us
[43:41] amen
[43:42] [Laughter]
[43:43] praise the Lord
[43:45] amen she protects him with this Crimson
[43:47] die and that dye gets all over the tree
[43:51] and everything and I'll show you
[43:53] pictures here in just a moment of what
[43:55] that looks like but it's all over and
[43:57] that's when she dies
[44:01] and the little and the little and the
[44:03] little worms or the little the sons or
[44:05] the daughters and the daughters I mean
[44:07] they have a new life ready to move on
[44:09] right
[44:11] all right so here's here's the little
[44:12] tree there's there's the the worm again
[44:15] it attach itself
[44:19] once on the tree the Crimson worm then
[44:21] attaches itself to the tree it makes
[44:23] sure it's secure because the body of the
[44:25] worm will eventually be the shelter for
[44:27] the young which are born it is so
[44:29] strongly and permanently stuck to the
[44:31] wood that the shell cannot be removed
[44:33] without tearing its bodies completely
[44:35] apart and killing it her body turns into
[44:37] a shell for protection of her babies it
[44:39] was not the nails that held Our Savior
[44:41] to the cross it was love
[44:44] when the baby worms or larva hatch they
[44:46] stay under the shell not only does the
[44:48] mother's body give protection for the
[44:50] babies but it also provides them with
[44:51] food the babies feed on the living body
[44:53] of the mother all right so that's a
[44:56] picture I showed you all ago that those
[44:57] are the eggs that were that were inside
[44:59] that's the shell right there under the
[45:02] mother
[45:02] all right Matthew 26
[45:06] 26 27 says and as they were eating Jesus
[45:09] Took bread and blessed it and break it
[45:10] and gave it to the disciples and said
[45:12] take eat this is my body
[45:15] all right hence the reason saints that I
[45:18] want you to look we're going to take
[45:20] communion this Sunday
[45:22] the importance of communion
[45:24] to a believer
[45:26] it's so so it's so great
[45:29] right
[45:30] partaking of communion because it's
[45:33] commemorating Amen what Jesus told us to
[45:35] do
[45:36] right it's not a suggestion Jesus says I
[45:39] suggest that you eat my body you know
[45:41] and and take eat my bread and drink my
[45:44] blood no he said take eat this is my
[45:47] body
[45:48] do this whenever you do it do it in
[45:50] remembrance of me
[45:52] right and then John 6 53 57 says then
[45:55] Jesus said unto them verily verily I say
[45:57] unto you except ye eat the Flesh of the
[45:59] son of man and drink his blood ye have
[46:02] no life in you
[46:03] whoso eateth My Flesh and drinketh my
[46:06] blood hath eternal life and I will raise
[46:08] him up at the last day for my flesh is
[46:10] me indeed and my blood is drinking deed
[46:12] he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my
[46:15] blood dwelleth in me and I in him as the
[46:18] living father has sent me and I live by
[46:20] the father so he that eateth me even he
[46:23] shall live by me now we know that Jesus
[46:26] is speaking there spiritually right
[46:27] eating off him is eating the word amen
[46:30] right we don't literally eat the body
[46:32] and the Flesh of Jesus Christ or drink
[46:34] his blood
[46:35] because we're not vampires
[46:38] and the Catholics amen they they believe
[46:41] in in trans trans I forget
[46:45] transubstestiation
[46:47] translation
[46:49] [Laughter]
[46:50] where they literally believe that the
[46:52] that the wafer that I used to take when
[46:53] I was in the Catholic Church
[46:55] my wife's taking it I know sister Anna
[46:57] Canard she's been she's been there they
[47:00] literally believe that that round wafer
[47:01] turns into the literal body of Jesus
[47:03] Christ
[47:04] and then when you're drinking the wine
[47:06] you're drinking the literal blood of
[47:08] Jesus Christ but we know that's not
[47:10] scriptural and we know that's not what
[47:12] Jesus was talking about so when we take
[47:14] communion where it's representations of
[47:17] his body representations of his blood
[47:19] right praise the Lord after just a few
[47:22] days of feeding on the living body of
[47:24] the mother the young worms grow and the
[47:25] mother dies it then secretes them so
[47:27] secretes that that that that Crimson
[47:30] blood uh Matthew 26 28 says for this is
[47:33] my blood of the new testament which is
[47:35] shed for many for the remission of sins
[47:37] Romans 5 9 says much more than being now
[47:40] justified by his blood we shall be saved
[47:43] from wrath through him praise the Lord
[47:45] what does that look like
[47:50] that's that is right there that's when
[47:53] the mother has completely
[47:56] killed herself
[47:58] but in killing herself or in dying she's
[48:01] covering her little young and it's so
[48:03] much Crimson that falls out that that
[48:06] that that it that it stains the the the
[48:08] the tree
[48:10] amen don't it look like that
[48:12] praise the Lord Jesus
[48:15] amen thank God for his for the
[48:17] blood-stained cross amen
[48:22] thank God for that what he did for us
[48:24] amen
[48:26] there's another another one of the
[48:28] stains there and I believe that on the
[48:30] right is the little babies
[48:32] ready to do their part
[48:35] right but they're covered and they're
[48:37] stained with the mothers
[48:39] with their mother's Crimson wax crimson
[48:42] amen amen the Christian amen can't get
[48:45] can't go without the blood of Jesus
[48:47] Christ
[48:48] Christianity isn't Christianity if
[48:50] there's no blood
[48:51] I mean it was like that at the beginning
[48:53] in Genesis that had to be Bloodshed in
[48:56] order to cover Adam and Eve amen there
[48:59] has to be blood or even a man to cover
[49:00] you in this hour thank God that he did
[49:03] it once and for all he doesn't have to
[49:04] constantly die for you and me he did it
[49:07] once and that's enough
[49:09] yeah hey man and it's up to you if you
[49:10] go to him
[49:12] for that for forgiveness of your sins
[49:14] praise the Lord amen so we see that this
[49:16] is this is this is they use this this to
[49:19] for the priests garments and also the
[49:21] Tabernacle Matthew 12 40 says for as
[49:24] Jonas was three days and three nights on
[49:26] the whole the whole belly so shall the
[49:28] son of man for three days and three
[49:30] nights in the in the heart of the earth
[49:32] so this is very interesting right here
[49:34] on the morning of the fourth day the
[49:36] worm has pulled the head and tail
[49:38] together and is now in the shape of a
[49:40] heart on the tree but it is no longer
[49:43] crimson
[49:45] it is now wax which is white as snow
[49:48] they can still harvest the wax and use
[49:50] it to make shellac a preservative wood
[49:53] the resurrection of Jesus Christ which
[49:55] serves as a preservative of the message
[49:57] of the Cross amen we know that that
[50:00] without the resurrection there is no And
[50:02] so there's the white the white right
[50:04] there that's after three days
[50:06] after they it has turned red or she
[50:09] releases this red this redness turns
[50:12] into this white wax
[50:14] which we know what happened on the
[50:16] Resurrection Day on the third day
[50:18] right the Eighth Day
[50:20] a new beginning
[50:22] remember what Isaiah said though your
[50:24] sins be a Scarlet they shall be white as
[50:27] snow
[50:28] right praise the Lord
[50:31] Psalms chapter 22 amen I am a worm and
[50:34] no man
[50:36] does that make a little bit more sense
[50:38] to you I am a worm it's not just saying
[50:42] that I am then oh I'm just it's there
[50:45] for a reason praise the Lord Jesus
[50:48] there's the white the whiteness there of
[50:51] the of the
[50:55] and they use that and they take that and
[50:56] use it for wax
[50:58] amen
[51:01] Psalms 22 14 David continues saying here
[51:04] I am poured out like water and all my
[51:06] bones are out of joint look what he says
[51:08] here my heart is like Wax
[51:11] it is melted in the midst of my bowels
[51:14] I don't think that that was there for
[51:16] just to be there and then in in the
[51:19] previous verses he talks about I am a
[51:21] worm
[51:22] Isaiah 1 18 come now let us reason
[51:24] together says the Lord though your sins
[51:26] be a Scarlet that's the word Shani they
[51:29] shall be as white as snow though they be
[51:31] red like Crimson that's the word Tola
[51:34] they shall be as War
[51:36] so the two words aren't as they're on
[51:38] the same in the same verse
[51:41] praise the Lord
[51:42] also the Crimson worm is a very fragrant
[51:45] when it's crushed
[51:48] they say they say that there's an odor
[51:51] that comes up when when when they crush
[51:53] it and and you can go to YouTube and you
[51:55] can actually see people crushing the
[51:57] little worm and making dye out of this
[52:00] little worm Ephesians 5 1 tells us be
[52:02] therefore followers of God as dear
[52:04] children and walk in love as Christ also
[52:07] has loved us and had given himself for
[52:08] us an offering and a sacrifice to God
[52:11] for a sweet smelling savor
[52:15] praise the Lord
[52:16] crushed worm was also used for medicine
[52:18] to help the heart beat smoothly
[52:21] amen
[52:23] but he was wounded for our
[52:24] transgressions he was bruised for our
[52:26] iniquities the chastisement of our peace
[52:28] was upon him and with his stripes we are
[52:31] healed
[52:33] praise the Lord for that amen
[52:36] so
[52:39] in a sense that's another reason Jesus
[52:40] become a worm to be kind of abate
[52:44] hey man
[52:45] kind of a bait in order to to
[52:49] to do full Redemption amen
[52:53] I like this God needed to sink his teeth
[52:55] of anger into something
[52:57] his appetite of holy wrath needed to be
[53:00] fed but Jesus didn't want him to feed on
[53:02] us
[53:03] amen you know we we deserved hell
[53:07] we deserve punishment
[53:09] we each and every one of us deserve what
[53:12] Jesus
[53:14] suffered on this on the cross and more
[53:18] but I'm so thankful that he took it for
[53:20] us
[53:22] amen and so when we're looking at at
[53:24] Easter coming up amen
[53:27] just think about
[53:28] amen just think about
[53:30] the things he suffered for us amen and
[53:33] how I should have taken I should have
[53:35] been in that place
[53:36] and he was I was on I was on his mind
[53:39] amen the whole time he was he was on
[53:41] that tree
[53:42] the whole time he was on that cross
[53:47] God has a purpose with all scripture
[53:50] and so II Timothy 3 16 tells us all
[53:53] scripture is given by inspiration of God
[53:56] amen all scripture
[53:59] I think this is the last the last I want
[54:02] you to read with me Psalms 22 31 well I
[54:05] have it right here that's it's the last
[54:07] verse there of this chapter
[54:10] and it's interesting because uh just go
[54:12] home this is your homework go home read
[54:13] the whole chapter
[54:15] and there's other things there that
[54:16] you'll see that it's talking about the
[54:18] crucifixion of Jesus but look what it
[54:20] says in the last verse in verse 31 it
[54:22] says it says there they shall come and
[54:26] shall declare his righteousness unto a
[54:29] people that shall be born
[54:34] that he hath done this
[54:37] amen let's read the the I'm gonna read
[54:40] the the previous verse let me see here
[54:44] 22
[54:48] um
[54:49] some Psalms 20 okay
[54:55] it's a seed Shall Serve him it shall be
[54:58] accounted to the Lord for a generation
[55:00] amen So speaking of of the of the future
[55:03] right
[55:06] they shall come and shall declare his
[55:08] righteousness unto a people that shall
[55:10] be born
[55:12] a new birth
[55:14] that he hath done this and when you look
[55:17] at when you look at that word that there
[55:19] or that phrase that he hath done this
[55:21] when you read it in the in the original
[55:23] in the original Hebrew we're almost done
[55:26] but when you read it in the region of
[55:27] Hebrew is only one word and it's the
[55:30] word
[55:30] I saw
[55:32] which means finished complete
[55:35] and what did Jesus say there on the on
[55:37] the cross
[55:38] when Jesus therefore had received the
[55:40] vinegar he said it is finished
[55:43] and he bowed his head and gave up the
[55:45] ghost
[55:46] amen
[55:48] it's complete Saints there is no excuse
[55:51] for you to carry your sin
[55:53] this afternoon
[55:56] it is done
[55:57] it's already done as the scripture as
[55:59] the song says
[56:02] we can be free from our from our
[56:04] condemnation
[56:06] we can be free from the guilt of sin
[56:08] because he's already taken it
[56:11] on the cross of Calvary for you he
[56:13] became a worm so that you don't become
[56:15] it
[56:18] praise the Lord Jesus amen I hope you
[56:21] loved I hope you you you you you learned
[56:23] something from there and take that with
[56:25] you you can look at it through it
[56:26] yourself
[56:27] and study it out
[56:29] but let's just think about these things
[56:32] as Easter's getting ready to come up and
