[1:12] amen and amen and amen and I want to see
[1:15] him don't you good to see everybody in
[1:18] the house of the Lord
[1:19] he's like turning your scriptures turn
[1:21] to Ephesians I miss Peter Peter where
[1:25] we've been reading then we'll go to acts
[1:28] 4 so we're going from first Peter one to
[1:33] acts 4 kind of picking up our thought
[1:36] moving on a little bit further want to
[1:39] try to conclude this message Sunday if
[1:42] possible but I don't know
[1:44] so we'll see to try to conclude the
[1:48] message that we've been on this is 42
[1:51] messages so you know at least there's
[1:54] one thing about it you order nowhere 1st
[1:55] Peter 1:22 and 23 is you know that
[2:00] anyway it'll be able to quote that by
[2:02] heart so but it's you know good to see
[2:05] everybody in the house of the Lord and
[2:06] just remember to pray for these that are
[2:09] sitting the different ones and I'll
[2:10] remember sister Gaby's mother there to
[2:13] go to be with them and all the different
[2:16] ones for the ounces to Ana keep them in
[2:19] mind or the dick just remember all the
[2:22] sick among us because God promised he'd
[2:25] send his word and heal us and deliver us
[2:28] from destruction so then that's what we
[2:31] depend on is to that part amen
[2:33] and I wanted to say too now Terrence
[2:35] made some announcements Sunday you might
[2:39] have wondered about this that or the
[2:40] other about the way he said things but
[2:43] he said what was needful about the what
[2:48] he called it the bathroom works around
[2:51] here our water bill has $8,000 a month
[2:55] because of knowledge just kidding gets
[3:00] you out of a sad-sack gets you to a
[3:03] thinking now but it's just the fact that
[3:06] a lot of people and it's not just the
[3:09] children now we've had some problems
[3:11] but getting up and go into the bathroom
[3:14] and and all I can see that hinders
[3:16] people around you so remember that you
[3:19] say yeah but you can't help that now but
[3:21] that's why we plan we make deliberate
[3:24] plans to try to cover time the
[3:27] sunday-school services the children
[3:31] start 15 minutes early right
[3:35] you know why or they can get through 15
[3:39] minutes after 10 you know why
[3:43] where they can go to the bathroom on the
[3:45] way up the we've tried to cover that we
[3:50] tried to make everything to be
[3:51] convenient we're sorry that we don't
[3:55] have a whole lot of bathrooms but you
[3:57] know still just do the best you can to
[4:00] try to do and see like Tarrant said it
[4:05] was funny that he made the statements
[4:07] and then for one service there was not
[4:10] one person went out to going to the
[4:12] bathroom
[4:12] so now that that oh and one brother he
[4:16] used to tell me say brother Dale you
[4:18] tell me what to do I'm not going to tell
[4:21] you what to do how can you tell anybody
[4:22] when they can go to the bathroom when
[4:24] they came I'm just trying to tell you to
[4:27] be sensible about it and teach your
[4:31] children to obey and and do and you know
[4:35] by the time there are seven or eight
[4:36] years old they should be sitting in the
[4:38] seat beside of you listening to the
[4:41] minister instead of drawing coloring
[4:44] writing notes writing letters adults a
[4:48] lot of times will write on things you
[4:51] know
[4:51] RIT fishermen related but not other
[4:55] things just be do the best we can to try
[4:58] to be as quiet as we can because
[5:02] contrary to popular opinion opinion I
[5:05] don't like to go to Walmart even and
[5:08] hear somebody there with a kid in and
[5:12] and this come it's making a complete
[5:15] destruction of the whole place and
[5:18] they're just standing there you notice
[5:20] looking around like
[5:22] one whose kid that is you know you know
[5:24] but that's just be the best we can all
[5:28] right do the best we can
[5:31] you gotta go go all right but just
[5:36] remember and you don't have to go twice
[5:40] and it's kind of like when one brother
[5:42] one brother told me one time he said and
[5:44] he made a mistake he said I can sit and
[5:47] wail for five hours without hardly
[5:49] moving said I love to wail I said he
[5:54] made a mistake
[5:54] because he told me one day he said but
[5:57] this long services and at that time he
[6:00] wasn't too long you know at all when he
[6:03] said these long services just get me I
[6:05] went you know what I wanted to say
[6:11] welding five hours but you can't sit for
[6:15] an hour and a half see don't worry about
[6:18] it you're not getting by with it it's
[6:20] all recorded yeah and that's what I say
[6:23] we say something and people are
[6:24] deliberately rebelled against that now
[6:27] when you do just remember you're
[6:32] rebelling against the authority of the
[6:34] whole church let alone the fact of this
[6:37] somebody making a statement you know so
[6:40] don't do that don't do it that way okay
[6:42] all right I just hold hardly agree with
[6:46] order and things brother Brown said even
[6:50] a child running backwards and forth in
[6:52] the church will hinder the next service
[6:57] now you say you believe you was a
[7:00] prophet but do we believe those things
[7:03] you know he said somebody with a bad
[7:05] attitude come in and bind the whole
[7:08] circuit he said you'll give an account
[7:09] for that
[7:12] that's you know what would it be more
[7:15] sensible you know we claim to say I was
[7:19] thinking about that today you know we
[7:20] say the you know the people over here
[7:24] would say well in another church or
[7:26] something well you know that's this your
[7:27] way I think and we think this way that
[7:29] was if we follow a prophet what he says
[7:34] we don't have to under about whether you
[7:37] believe this or you believe that it's
[7:40] whether or not we believe what he said
[7:43] because he was trying his best to make
[7:46] us all and I'd still say it too you know
[7:49] he was a human being and people are
[7:52] human beings I've said in a lot of
[7:56] services and you have to I mean
[7:58] listening to tapes not at the Tabernacle
[7:59] but I listen to a lot of tapes in my
[8:03] lifetime and you know what there'll be
[8:07] children on our Holland talking
[8:09] screaming and write this while the
[8:12] Prophet is preaching his heart out
[8:14] he's just so gracious he just keeps
[8:17] right on going
[8:17] how he seals that out I don't know I can
[8:21] do a pretty good job of it you know
[8:23] because doors open this with them and I
[8:26] do a pretty good job of cutting it out
[8:27] you can't cut everything so just yes
[8:30] just okay all right do those things all
[8:32] right we're going to first Peter and
[8:34] then we will go to ax for father we
[8:38] thank you for this day in your grace we
[8:40] thank you for the word that we have the
[8:43] ability Lord to be able to believe it
[8:45] thank you for your understanding
[8:47] Lord that you've given unto each and
[8:50] every one of us that we can look to you
[8:52] the author and finisher of our faith and
[8:54] Lord we love you and we thank you we
[8:58] want the people to know we love them cuz
[8:59] that's what we're trying our best to
[9:01] save our souls all of us and to try to
[9:05] help each and every one of us to be what
[9:07] you want us to be just have your way let
[9:10] your loving grace be with us forgive our
[9:12] sins cleanse us and keep us in Jesus
[9:15] name
[9:16] amen okay Oh favorite first Peter 1:22
[9:23] seeing you have purified your souls and
[9:26] obeying the truth through the spirit
[9:27] unto unfeigned love of the Brethren see
[9:30] that you love one another with a pure
[9:32] heart fervently being born again not of
[9:35] corruptible seed but of incorruptible by
[9:38] the Word of God which liveth and abideth
[9:41] for ever all right what is the new birth
[9:48] how long have we been teaching it
[9:50] 40-something years since I heard the
[9:52] Prophet and read the scripture what the
[9:55] new birth is the birth of the word now
[9:58] tell me anything else it could be
[10:00] well I shouted I cried as well that's
[10:03] aftereffect what is the birth all right
[10:06] now let's go to acts 4 and we'll begin
[10:11] reading at verse 7 through 12 and when
[10:19] they had set them in the midst they
[10:21] asked you know this is the disciples
[10:22] when they come in and the high priests
[10:25] and always asking them says by what
[10:28] power or about what name have you done
[10:30] this then Peter filled with the Holy
[10:33] Ghost said unto them you rulers are the
[10:35] people and elders of Israel if we this
[10:38] day be examined of the good deed done
[10:41] done to the impotent man by which means
[10:45] what means he has made whole be it known
[10:48] unto you all and to all the people of
[10:51] Israel that by the name of Jesus Christ
[10:55] of Nazareth whom you crucified whom God
[10:58] raised from the dead even by him that
[11:02] this man stand here for you hope this is
[11:06] the stone which was set at nought of you
[11:10] builders which has become the head of
[11:13] the corner neither is there salvation in
[11:17] any other there's no salvation no words
[11:20] else but in that corner where there is
[11:23] none other name under heaven given among
[11:25] men whereby you must be saved
[11:28] amen you may be seated
[11:30] that is blessing to the reading of the
[11:31] word now this statement here that we
[11:37] just read about the stone which the
[11:40] builders you know disallowed that's
[11:44] actually covered counting this scripture
[11:47] it's covered almost verbatim to the tee
[11:50] of wording in this in Psalms 48 it's in
[11:58] Matthew 21 it's in mark 12 and Luke 20
[12:03] plus where we're at now that he is the
[12:06] corner stone all right now then let's
[12:11] get to point of where we've been for a
[12:14] while and try to just review up a little
[12:17] bit to her that we are into what we're
[12:21] talking about okay now the last message
[12:25] we were laying it heavily we had company
[12:28] so I had to divert around and I don't
[12:31] mean wrong I love company it makes us a
[12:34] lot of times back up and say things
[12:36] different so it's not our say well we
[12:39] had to I blame the company no no see we
[12:43] try to blame everybody else but
[12:44] ourselves but you know I love company to
[12:48] come because it makes you think a little
[12:50] different preaching a little different
[12:52] act a little different and you're doing
[12:54] but we did have a good bit of company in
[12:56] our Sunday so I had to back up Conda and
[13:00] trying to talk about the prophets
[13:04] message that you know we we've studied
[13:09] it we went through it I contend one
[13:12] thing because that's why I've always
[13:14] believed it that the new birth is the
[13:21] birth of the word all right now the new
[13:26] birth now you tell me what else it would
[13:27] be what are you talking about what
[13:29] anything else could you say or even
[13:31] think or even we're allowed to penetrate
[13:34] the cranium cap of your brain as we call
[13:38] it to think about anything other than
[13:40] the birth of the word
[13:43] what did the Prophet say Christ mister
[13:45] God revealed the new birth is a
[13:48] revelation of Jesus Christ personally to
[13:51] you all right see in that new birth then
[13:55] is the birth of the word okay now watch
[14:01] that in a minute when we get to what is
[14:03] the headstone we'll be covering that in
[14:07] a minute we get down to it if not we'll
[14:09] go as far as we can all right the now
[14:13] the stature of a perfect man covers how
[14:18] that God is showing how to us to come to
[14:24] the position he wants us to come to all
[14:29] right it starts with the new birth which
[14:35] is faith all right now starting there
[14:39] then and it ends up with the headstone
[14:42] or capstone coming forth all right
[14:46] but we've read here now and we ought to
[14:48] be able to follow it that when Jesus
[14:52] Christ came into the world he was to
[14:57] Israel Almighty God the head of all
[15:02] things all right he was the King of
[15:07] Kings the Lord of glory he was the
[15:09] headstone
[15:11] okay all right now because what was he
[15:17] what is the headstone what is the
[15:19] cornerstone the cornerstone is the Word
[15:23] of God is that sensible I mean that
[15:26] should be a thought to our mind it is
[15:29] the Word of God it is God's Word that is
[15:33] revealed to you and I it's a cornerstone
[15:36] that's what got me you know when I heard
[15:39] the story told of it that word that when
[15:41] brother Branham had talked about the
[15:43] cornerstone and did he put some things
[15:45] in there and to come find out they went
[15:47] in there and tore that stone open to try
[15:49] to find out what it was that's sick of
[15:51] me when I heard that too to the bottom
[15:53] into my heart why anybody would want
[15:55] some
[15:55] kind of an idea I don't care who it is I
[15:58] don't care who went in there they were
[16:01] mentally sick you say you shouldn't talk
[16:05] that away why not
[16:08] they was trying to find something well
[16:12] if he wanted us to find it he would have
[16:14] told us what it was but to go in and
[16:18] tear in to try to find that something
[16:22] within that and they had in their hands
[16:29] are the ability are the the tapes the
[16:33] books etc to tell you what was in that
[16:36] corner he said what was in that we
[16:45] wanted to know what was in that corner I
[16:47] thought the word was the cornerstone I
[16:53] thought the reason it wound up being a
[16:55] cornerstone was that Israel as we read
[16:59] rejected Israel Peter learned in act
[17:06] they rejected Jesus Christ as their head
[17:13] thank God they did well blow unto them
[17:19] that happened by right cuz you realize
[17:22] if they had not of turned down that
[17:24] headstone you and I would not be here it
[17:29] would have been a Jewish thing
[17:32] scepter Li to Israel and it would have
[17:37] been no Gentiles involved we'd have been
[17:41] totally out of it so thank God for what
[17:44] they done but woe unto them that done it
[17:49] what else could he come to and I
[17:51] remember when I was in the badges I used
[17:53] to think about you know the the white
[17:56] people done and I'd read the Bible and
[18:00] you know and in reading it it would tell
[18:03] about the things they'd done to him and
[18:05] how they treated him and you know what
[18:08] he done
[18:09] raise the dead he'll too sick fed to
[18:13] people I remembered thinking about that
[18:17] wasn't a Baptist Church thinking God you
[18:23] never done nothing but right
[18:25] what would they get any justification no
[18:28] point to be able to kill them or
[18:32] anything let alone I mean if the fact of
[18:36] just turning him down is their Savior
[18:37] their master look what it's Costin you
[18:43] know you don't think like that I think
[18:44] about it some death and considering look
[18:48] at the way they treated you Lord and all
[18:49] you ever done was treated them good he
[18:56] was the headstone to the church all
[19:00] right he was rejected by Israel as the
[19:07] head and very stood in what was he in
[19:12] the beginning was the word Word was with
[19:14] God and the Word was God and Word was
[19:17] made flesh and dwelt among us
[19:19] what Wade's been on trying to express to
[19:22] you about son of man see Jesus Christ
[19:26] fulfilled all of those things I was
[19:30] thinking oh today we're thinking about
[19:32] when when you remember brother
[19:33] Bosworth that's that what was the name
[19:37] dr. bass or something when he asked him
[19:39] or said I've got one question I'd like
[19:41] to ask
[19:44] and he said there's a seven compound
[19:47] names of Jehovah applied it's Jesus
[19:50] Christ little random even said one time
[19:52] where he said I never thought that he
[19:56] said they wouldn't no way in the world a
[19:57] man can go anywhere said because if he
[20:00] was Jehovah Rapha he was Jehovah Jireh
[20:04] if he was our Savior he'd have to be our
[20:09] healer to all be straight all right now
[20:10] think of the same way that the Lord
[20:13] Jesus Christ and his earthly journey had
[20:17] to fulfill the four things the Son of
[20:21] God well let's make it correct
[20:23] son of man first then son of God then
[20:28] back to son of man and then son of David
[20:31] do you believe he fulfilled all of those
[20:34] things which is check out who they were
[20:36] to see to it well he was the word the
[20:41] son of man which the son of man I knew
[20:43] this in a Baptist Church we used to
[20:45] study it that son of man means
[20:47] resurrection because that's what he said
[20:49] he said I'm the resurrection see he he
[20:55] was the resurrection the son of man
[20:58] that's why he's got to come back in the
[21:00] end time into the bride for the
[21:04] resurrection to take place all right but
[21:07] you see they couldn't understand him
[21:09] when he would say was son of man they
[21:13] said you're a man making yourself God
[21:15] now his garden making himself a man see
[21:18] they had it backwards they couldn't
[21:19] figure it out
[21:20] but yet he wound up he fulfilling the
[21:25] scriptures and they still rejected him
[21:29] all right but then on the day of
[21:33] Pentecost he could not come to the
[21:37] Gentile dispensation as the headstone
[21:42] because you can how the headstones you
[21:44] got the cornerstone first there's a
[21:46] message about two rows down pipes this
[21:48] one
[21:48] that'll be talking about sometimes it'll
[21:51] help us to understand that about like
[21:53] former and latter rain a different thing
[21:55] all right
[21:55] see he could not become now listen very
[22:00] carefully cuz I hate to just keep saying
[22:02] it you know you read it in the Bible
[22:04] that he was the head of the church I
[22:06] mean the Bible says that that he was the
[22:09] head of the church uh-huh but what is it
[22:12] saying he was not the headstone because
[22:16] that was rejected he was the head of the
[22:19] corner he left his position who it
[22:23] should have been the entire pyramid then
[22:25] and come down to be the chief
[22:29] Cornerstone which Chief means the the
[22:32] corner the corner the one you foundation
[22:35] stone in other words you start building
[22:37] the house you start one place all right
[22:42] then you let out from that place if you
[22:44] get that place everything works good but
[22:47] if you don't it gets all out of shape
[22:50] all right we see he become the headstone
[22:53] of the corner are the head of the corner
[22:55] he become the head of the church on the
[22:59] day of Pentecost
[23:02] when the baptism of the Holy Ghost came
[23:05] into the disciples that they had been
[23:07] tutored and trained by that word for 3.5
[23:10] years following the Lord Jesus all right
[23:15] hearing him talking and seeing the signs
[23:18] and wonders knowing that he was saying
[23:21] something and then seeing that he you
[23:24] know that they saw he was rejected by
[23:26] the Jews but he couldn't become he
[23:30] couldn't come straight to the church as
[23:31] the headstone he had to come to the
[23:36] church as the cornerstone because that
[23:40] would start to pyramid go look where
[23:42] you'd have the thing turned totally
[23:44] upside down but he becomes the headstone
[23:47] are the head of the corner he become the
[23:51] foundational stone all right and what is
[23:55] the Bible saying Ephesians built on the
[23:56] foundation apostles and prophets Jesus
[23:58] Christ being what the chief Cornerstone
[24:02] one see the disciple had no message of
[24:06] their own I want to get to that a little
[24:07] bit Sunday that's why I keep saying that
[24:11] you don't follow
[24:13] maybe my thoughts but see if you listen
[24:16] to not how the prophets message had to
[24:18] come you will see then what took place
[24:23] in the day in the hour that was back
[24:27] tyre the Lord willing but listen when
[24:31] Israel rejected the head stone
[24:34] cornerstone whatever you want to call it
[24:38] really they rejected the new birth is
[24:41] that right now remember now we'll come
[24:44] to Jesus with with John 3 what was
[24:48] Jesus's first message you must be born
[24:50] again you must be born from above he
[24:53] explained it to him of what they needed
[24:55] and they rejected that and even the
[25:00] disciples couldn't understand that
[25:03] because even after his resurrection when
[25:08] he met with him over in the book of Acts
[25:10] they said will you return the kingdom to
[25:12] Israel at this time
[25:14] they still didn't see he was speaking of
[25:17] a spiritual Kingdom that we would become
[25:22] to them the word of the cornerstone
[25:28] because the headstone had been rejected
[25:32] there was no way could come into
[25:33] manifestation no now listen even if it
[25:37] hadn't been for Israel involved in it
[25:39] there would still be no way that you
[25:42] could bring the Gentile dispensation
[25:43] into being of the headstone because you
[25:46] gotta have the corner stone before the
[25:50] headstone can come or else you're trying
[25:53] to put the corner stone on top of the
[25:56] headstone now you've got to build
[26:00] something for for God to cap off right
[26:03] so then you see the Gentile dispensation
[26:07] as it come into being and Jesus
[26:11] preaching to those disciples the son of
[26:14] man actually sowed the seed right the
[26:19] son of man sowed the seed of the kingdom
[26:22] all right he went away gave his life
[26:27] prophet said he passed away on the part
[26:31] of son of man he come back as son of God
[26:38] the new birth into the church giving
[26:41] birth to that word that he had sown into
[26:43] their hearts and there was the
[26:46] cornerstone all right so the cornerstone
[26:50] now is the new birth now you've got the
[26:54] pyramid started so you look at faith and
[26:56] you look at the statue of a perfect man
[26:58] this is what I've been trying to preach
[27:00] all the time you look at that any of you
[27:03] ever studied the pyramids you ever
[27:06] looked at the drawing of that you
[27:08] realize the whole kingdom everything is
[27:10] within there I was thinking today about
[27:12] it you just to mention a little bit of
[27:15] you look at the natural pyramid when you
[27:17] enter in you come down here there's an
[27:20] upside-down chamber
[27:24] they know nothing about Hawaiian there's
[27:26] an upside-down chamber one because we
[27:28] everybody entered the world upside down
[27:30] out of cater and lost then you start
[27:34] back up through the pyramid you come
[27:36] through the Queen's Chamber and into the
[27:39] King's Chamber and there's three blocks
[27:41] into that tunnel going up that keeps you
[27:44] from going up and that's justification
[27:46] Saint case the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[27:48] we're not trying to preach a pyramid
[27:50] doctrine we're trying to preach it or
[27:52] tell the truth of what everything is
[27:54] spoken on placed in the correct order
[27:58] alright now see then the headstone which
[28:02] was Jesus Christ as it was rejected by
[28:09] Israel he becomes the cornerstone to the
[28:16] permeate I mean to to the church on the
[28:19] day of Pentecost he came back in the
[28:23] form now listen to what I'm saying he
[28:26] came back in the form of the baptism of
[28:28] the Holy Ghost the baptism of the Holy
[28:35] Ghost is the word made alive alright are
[28:42] you listening to the baptism of the Holy
[28:45] Ghost that you received is the word that
[28:48] was made alive to you and that's where
[28:51] the birth is that inside of you in your
[28:55] soul changing it to making it into the
[29:00] position that God can come and dwell in
[29:03] all right so the Pentecostal church
[29:06] started out the way God wanted it right
[29:11] by the new birth coming into the hearts
[29:14] of the Saints and see that birth what if
[29:17] they hadn't heard the word then what's
[29:20] these statements they're going to be
[29:21] valuable later on what if they hadn't
[29:23] heard the word I've always tried to
[29:27] emphasize that the Bible said he was
[29:31] seen of over 500 brethren after his
[29:35] resurrection
[29:37] another scripture were they on the net
[29:42] Pentecost he got a hundred and twenty
[29:48] that leaves 380 of them that didn't get
[29:51] there why there was something wrong with
[29:58] them they didn't have their heart set in
[30:01] the right point our position but if they
[30:04] had they'd have been in that Upper Room
[30:09] see maybe they hadn't heard enough word
[30:11] to get to the basis of understanding but
[30:15] I've never decrease teen I've been
[30:17] because really I like the way the Bible
[30:18] says thing it says a 500 brethren I'm
[30:25] not saying they didn't go and receive
[30:27] the new birth a lot of them come on
[30:29] later probably into the kingdom not D
[30:34] Christianizing nobody and saying they
[30:35] was lost but they did not accept Jesus
[30:39] Christ at that time and he became the
[30:42] head of the corner or the head of the
[30:45] New Testament church all right that's
[30:48] Paul in his writings and I think he's in
[30:50] theevans that he becomes the head all
[30:53] right now being that head then look if
[30:58] the head now I'm asking you a simple
[31:01] question I want you to say this simple
[31:04] if the corners if the headstone was the
[31:08] word made alive in human flesh
[31:17] the Lord Jesus Christ then what would be
[31:21] the headstone the revealed word right
[31:31] made flesh in a man what would be the
[31:38] end time is the headstone and you see he
[31:47] became the word made flesh because
[31:51] there's a lot of saying or timer or what
[31:55] if you call it this thirty something
[31:57] years or thirty years between John one
[32:01] where it said in the beginning was the
[32:02] word words with God the Word was God and
[32:04] verse 14 where it says and the Word was
[32:07] made flesh and dwelt among us there's a
[32:11] lot of time in between there that he was
[32:14] that word all right
[32:16] what see when he when he did now keep
[32:19] that doubt in your mind this is the one
[32:21] saith the headstone was the revealed
[32:26] word are the alive word now I have never
[32:31] taught the new birth has been an
[32:35] intellectual conception of the Word of
[32:38] God it wouldn't matter if I have read
[32:43] six books in one day and listened to two
[32:45] tapes I still didn't have the baptism of
[32:48] the Holy Ghost with how many people
[32:52] would put all of that intellectualism or
[32:54] thoughts opponent and say well I had to
[32:56] be warned again look what I've done
[32:58] yeah I rejected my family I rejected
[33:01] just about everything I mean this
[33:03] pullback away and just stayed the best I
[33:06] could do and just read and read and read
[33:09] and read and studied this message
[33:14] he said no my dearest and is a little
[33:19] nano got right now cut it in a pack is a
[33:22] church age book and you know what I got
[33:25] in the other part of my pack is
[33:28] earphones with a tape player you know
[33:35] what I'm doing while I'm deer hunting I
[33:39] have went through three tapes just cycle
[33:44] through them sitting there go what are
[33:45] you gonna do I mean you're just looking
[33:48] what are you gonna do you know so I just
[33:52] said turn read or listen to tapes why
[33:56] because that's my desire I love God's
[34:00] Word all right let's see if we don't get
[34:05] to word in the field and okay it won't
[34:08] work all right
[34:10] but now remember the point listen and
[34:13] we'll get to the other point in a minute
[34:15] the headstone which was all of the Word
[34:20] of God now listen all of the Word of God
[34:24] stood on earth in a man called Jesus
[34:28] Christ you go with that now there are
[34:35] some things that he said that Israel I
[34:39] mean the assault and the Apostles didn't
[34:41] understand but you just remember now
[34:43] cause you see you're gonna run off on
[34:44] the dead in Jesus preached the seals
[34:50] that's Matthew 24 all right he preached
[34:55] them but nobody knew what he's talking
[34:57] about how that way she's that way you
[35:03] don't add to the word so don't get any
[35:06] thought than when I say it when he was
[35:08] standing a tire on the sort of guy that
[35:10] was Almighty God will you agree that was
[35:15] the Son of Man the Son of God the Son of
[35:18] David the son of everything we needed
[35:22] but he had to make these stage manifest
[35:25] along the journey to be this and then to
[35:28] be this and then be this but he was the
[35:32] word made alive not just a man made
[35:36] alive not just a human being we call
[35:39] Jesus I see Jesus only doctrines and
[35:43] things no he was the Lord Jesus Christ
[35:49] standing on earth in a human flesh in
[35:53] him the Bible said dwelt the fullness of
[35:56] the Godhead bodily
[35:59] all right now what's this thing going to
[36:03] wind up being wade was asking when I
[36:10] taught on the son of man what he was
[36:13] saying about where we were trying to let
[36:14] up in line was in 82 of all of you heard
[36:17] me at least make the statement the first
[36:20] sermon I preached in this message in
[36:22] 1969 in Athens Georgia after receiving
[36:28] the baptism of the holy ghost of 2 years
[36:32] in this message I preached a sermon
[36:34] brother Mansfield wanted to need to take
[36:37] a service while he was going to be gone
[36:38] for the weekend and I took a couple of
[36:40] services and I taught that the bride of
[36:42] Jesus Christ would be the son of man
[36:45] I still got written in front of my Bible
[36:49] a lot of the quotes were your prophet
[36:52] City but are you gonna listen to him are
[36:56] you gonna listen to your own thoughts
[36:57] and ideas
[36:58] see that's why if I read to you what he
[37:01] said you can't argue because you claim
[37:08] to be believe in the message so you
[37:15] can't deny you can call the intellect
[37:18] you can call me anything you want to I
[37:20] don't care
[37:22] but you can't say that I didn't tell you
[37:25] what he said well if you're out you know
[37:28] come on I don't matter if it's my idea
[37:30] who it is if I read to you John 3:16
[37:35] that is God's Word
[37:38] yeah but I believe see that's where the
[37:39] thing goes wrong the word said it the
[37:43] word is right it don't make no
[37:44] difference whether we say it right or
[37:46] what we do but all I ask you to do is
[37:49] come show me then in here 40 something
[37:55] years later 50 years later still
[38:00] believing that the bride of Jesus Christ
[38:03] will be the Word made flesh in the end
[38:09] time and there is your son of man I'm
[38:17] just trying to get you to think about it
[38:19] see there stood Almighty God in human
[38:24] flesh but now listen staying in that
[38:29] position he could not save no one he
[38:35] consoled the seed which he did he sowed
[38:38] the kingdom of mi in the Gospels the Son
[38:41] of Man is the sower of the seed he sowed
[38:43] the seed of the kingdom the devil showed
[38:45] us to see to what happened on the day of
[38:50] Pentecost what had been sown into the
[38:54] hearts that's why everybody didn't make
[38:56] it
[38:56] that's why the 500 didn't get there they
[39:01] didn't how that works own down in their
[39:03] heart
[39:05] they had parts and maybe things but they
[39:08] didn't have it but there's only a
[39:10] hundred and twenty had it enough into
[39:15] their hearts and by gaining that's your
[39:18] to understand it was twelve was all they
[39:21] was back here one of them was the devil
[39:23] told you back to 11
[39:24] take Matthias Prettyman making you 12
[39:29] which we know it was wrong for them to
[39:31] do that they couldn't wait on Paul to
[39:32] become the one but he came to 13th and
[39:35] that was perfectly scriptural cousin in
[39:37] the Old Testament it was twelve tribes
[39:39] gathered around the Levites which is in
[39:41] the middle study your Bible they were
[39:45] twelve tribes gathered around the one
[39:48] tribe which was Israel I mean which
[39:50] wouldn't leave us and leave I had no
[39:52] inheritance
[39:57] God said I'm your inheritance what he
[40:01] brought around say when he went out
[40:02] there and standing looking up at all
[40:03] those buildings it's like God said you
[40:07] there's mine
[40:09] there's yours the whole heavens which is
[40:12] the Word of God
[40:12] okay listen see the cornerstone Jesus
[40:17] Christ had to become the cornerstone to
[40:20] the church in the new birth which would
[40:26] be the birth of that word at the head
[40:28] take taken and held on to all right and
[40:33] when they receive the new birth it was
[40:38] the word that was made alive nukkie
[40:41] followed me
[40:46] see it was the word that was planted
[40:50] made alive by the baptism of the holy
[40:54] ghost see that's a new birth that's why
[40:58] I brought around and we'll cover the
[40:59] baptism of the holy ghost as being the
[41:01] new burner it is you gotta have
[41:04] something to quicken the word the dead
[41:07] letter of the word is not no course not
[41:10] no headstone and it ain't even the
[41:12] cornerstone the letter of the words not
[41:16] a cornerstone headstone or nothing but
[41:21] the revealed word that's why I've always
[41:24] told you and I'm sincere in meaning it I
[41:27] would to God I had revealed to me what
[41:31] is in this head of what I heard that
[41:36] prophet say do you not think like that I
[41:41] wouldn't do God did all of that was
[41:44] revealed to me but one day I will now I
[41:50] love the promise he said I'll bring to
[41:51] your remembrance whatsoever I've said
[41:53] and I like this one and he said even
[41:56] teach you things to come brother Brennan
[41:59] said he not only brought to the
[42:00] disciples what they what he had taught
[42:02] him but he said he taught him on the
[42:04] future things to come he told them
[42:06] things to come all right they went on
[42:09] wrote the book The Book of Revelations
[42:10] and I mean the the acts in a different
[42:13] time all right
[42:13] yeah now watch what I'm saying
[42:18] see then if we can see that the new
[42:23] birth has always been the birth of the
[42:30] word as you can follow that talk that
[42:37] the new birth has always been the birth
[42:43] of the word what else is it I cried I
[42:47] shouted I spoke in tongues brother Dale
[42:49] just don't understand what the birth is
[42:53] hey just get the baptism in the Holy
[42:56] Ghost one day on what you got and don't
[42:58] worry about the shout another thing
[42:59] didn't take care of itself all right we
[43:03] can talk all night long if you want to
[43:04] talk about some presence of the Lord I
[43:07] can talk with you so then don't don't
[43:10] play with me
[43:11] and be serious because you've heard me
[43:13] say it for years and years so there's
[43:15] one thing about it and I stand up here
[43:16] or not and saying it I've seen God I've
[43:19] smelled him I've been in his presence
[43:23] and I've had him to talk to me and tell
[43:27] me things but I just don't lay on that
[43:31] because I know you get to building on it
[43:33] and you'll wind up to be to wear that
[43:35] you'll be building on that base I don't
[43:37] wanna I want you built on the basis of
[43:38] the word that's revealed to you not what
[43:43] he's done for me
[43:44] what he's done for you I love your
[43:48] experience I'll withhold telling of my
[43:52] experience to hear yours
[43:53] because I love it all right but listen
[44:00] then if the new birth is the birth of
[44:04] the word it's been that in every age cuz
[44:08] ever was a the age of the baptism of the
[44:11] Holy Ghost for the individual in every
[44:14] age they had a word to be brought for
[44:17] that age in time the new birth was the
[44:20] birth of that word
[44:22] that's why Martin Luther was already a
[44:25] believer he was a priest in all kind of
[44:30] things he'd already went to a lot of
[44:32] things but then God spoke to him about
[44:34] the just shall live by faith
[44:36] and that was his new birth
[44:41] that's what turned the world upside down
[44:44] not Martin Luther protests in the
[44:46] Catholic Church uh-huh it's like I've
[44:50] told you that devil he didn't get mad
[44:53] then people didn't get mad for for
[44:55] Martin Luther going out to our doing
[44:57] those thing but when the people begin to
[44:59] listen to Martin Luther and experience
[45:02] the same birth he experienced then the
[45:07] devil got mad see that's what I've
[45:10] always expected I want to stir him up I
[45:13] want to make that devil so mad or trying
[45:16] to preach the word until he'll come
[45:17] after us wherever way why because the
[45:20] Prophet said the bride always does
[45:24] better under persecution well oh you you
[45:30] want persecution on us huh no I just
[45:32] know it's coming because the Prophet
[45:34] said it
[45:36] we're experienced now you can't scare
[45:39] you
[45:40] that don't work ain't scared to devil
[45:43] out of nobody you scared more Devils in
[45:47] and you scare out don't try to secure it
[45:49] out of people you know try to talk them
[45:51] to the wrong thing that's why it's not
[45:53] that away it's like I was saying our
[45:55] Sunday if we can just believe that Jesus
[46:01] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[46:03] forever and living in our hearts and
[46:05] giving something personal to us and this
[46:09] is something to you and me you know no
[46:15] wonder the devil get upset all right
[46:17] season if the new birth is the birth of
[46:20] the word now let's lay it on our heart
[46:24] if the new birth is the birth of the
[46:27] word and now you tell me I'm serious I
[46:31] don't mean be sarcastic or hateful you
[46:34] tell me something else about the new
[46:35] birth beside it being the birth of the
[46:37] word
[46:42] you can't tell me what it is beside
[46:45] being the birth of the work cuz you're
[46:46] gonna make it some kind of shouting
[46:47] speaking in tongues grunting I believed
[46:50] it so did the devil now were you at he'd
[46:57] believe more than we do because the
[47:00] Bible said he believed one garden
[47:02] trembled you ever trembled about the
[47:05] fact that what God is showing you you've
[47:08] never been in his presence then because
[47:11] any as president is not a great big
[47:13] thing that you think glory hallelujah
[47:14] stir no it's not it's a very serious
[47:17] matter to stand in the presence of
[47:20] Almighty God there's not no glory
[47:25] hallelujah shouting and running around
[47:26] it's a very sincere matter to ever think
[47:30] about standing in the presence of
[47:32] Almighty God to think of him coming down
[47:36] to us okay
[47:38] listen see then if the new birth is the
[47:44] birth of the word and Jesus Christ had
[47:46] to die to release that life that was
[47:49] within him that it could come back upon
[47:51] the disciples that he had planted within
[47:54] them and he came back on the day of
[47:56] Pentecost in the form of the baptism of
[47:58] the Holy Ghost which is the new birth
[48:00] the birth of the word they had heard
[48:03] that was why that when they received it
[48:06] they could come all the way up here to
[48:07] where it said Holy Spirit but the 3,000
[48:11] outside that received it a little later
[48:13] on in the day could only come to faith
[48:16] and be F babes desire the sincere milk
[48:19] of the word when Paul and when Peter was
[48:22] and then were saying these things that
[48:24] we've read about babe they were talking
[48:27] about their selves Paul wouldn't said
[48:30] Peter your baby
[48:33] no he rebuked him openly from way words
[48:36] though because he had problems right but
[48:41] brother Ron said it was not over
[48:42] doctrine it was just the way Peter
[48:44] behaved himself all right which is he
[48:48] Peter wouldn't tell him Paul that he was
[48:49] a baby and Paul wouldn't telling Peter
[48:51] he was
[48:51] maybe it was telling the others that
[48:55] there were babies desiring the sincere
[48:58] of milk of the word that they may grow
[48:59] thy body see that we might grow up in
[49:02] him who is the head of all things am i
[49:05] quoting scriptures so then if the new
[49:08] birth is the birth of the word then what
[49:15] would be the headstone what would be the
[49:21] headstone
[49:25] because she's remember now - before they
[49:30] could have a birth they had to have a
[49:34] message all right are you it before the
[49:39] holy ghost could come upon the disciples
[49:42] they had to have the message that the
[49:45] Lord Jesus Christ taught them shone down
[49:47] in their hearts and then when the Holy
[49:49] Ghost would come
[49:50] it would quicken that was shown into
[49:52] their heart that's the message that was
[49:55] made alive one of their Pentecost that's
[49:57] the word I'm talking about that's the
[50:00] word made flesh a lot if that be true
[50:04] then what would be the headstone would
[50:07] it not be the birth of the full word
[50:14] would it not be the birth of that work
[50:17] when I've got a couple of them laying
[50:19] here if you want to listen to him on
[50:21] blasphemy it's nights where brother
[50:22] Brennan says I'm Bert we're birthed into
[50:24] this into this into this earth into
[50:27] these times each one of these virtues
[50:32] you're gonna have to be birthed into
[50:34] that virtue
[50:35] you're not birthed into patience and
[50:37] then come back down and get virtue
[50:39] you've got to be birthed into virtue
[50:41] knowledge temperance and then expect the
[50:43] birth of patience all right but get to
[50:49] one thing if you don't get nothing else
[50:50] out of the message tonight if we believe
[50:55] the new birth is the birth of the word
[51:03] ah
[51:05] I've tried to explain what that is the
[51:08] word that Jesus Christ sewn into their
[51:10] hearts was made alive to them on the day
[51:13] of Pentecost they came out of there
[51:20] capable of telling the others about
[51:25] Jesus that's why I've asked you just to
[51:29] read acts 2 and a 1 and 2 and they come
[51:32] out of that upper room
[51:33] Paul Peters got a message right read it
[51:39] he goes all the way back in the Old
[51:42] Testament and brings down Jesus Christ
[51:45] read acts 1 and 2 he brings him right
[51:50] down to where it's at and said this is
[51:52] the one that you builders has rejected
[51:57] or said it not said he's now the head of
[52:01] the church by being the chief
[52:04] Cornerstone of that church he's the head
[52:07] of it then cuz he says had a headstone
[52:10] but not the headstone
[52:16] because listen are you listening see
[52:23] Jesus Christ preached some things that
[52:25] was not made of life to them disciples
[52:28] tire earth were the case is that that's
[52:31] what it's all linked to what did he
[52:35] preach to them disciples are preached
[52:38] that they didn't get they could question
[52:44] him about the kingdom he explained the
[52:45] kingdom he told him all about the new
[52:48] birth he told him about this order the
[52:50] seat he told him about all of the
[52:51] parables right but what was it he'd ever
[52:56] told them and what was it that mankind
[53:02] has never known until the last days then
[53:10] you'll see what I was trying to get at
[53:11] Sunday that the Prophet did have a
[53:14] message he had a message this wouldn't
[53:24] be good and go to church and try to hide
[53:26] and dress and clothes that's all they
[53:27] want to preach about the message and say
[53:29] that's the it oh we're gonna find that
[53:30] life seed praise God I hope we do
[53:33] I hope he's here tonight but it won't be
[53:35] just to that hunting the life seed I
[53:38] know we're brother Brown said he was
[53:40] hunting that life seed sure praise God
[53:42] we all ought to be
[53:48] but what if that seeds already in what's
[53:52] gonna happen then see then if the new
[53:59] birth was the birth of the word of the
[54:01] day of Pentecost that made the disciples
[54:05] alive in the kingdom knowing that they
[54:10] were the cornerstone with Jesus Christ
[54:12] and that's why it says in Ephesians that
[54:15] were built on the foundation apostles
[54:17] and prophets Jesus Christ foundation
[54:20] sees the starting stone Jesus Christ
[54:24] being the head stone or the head of the
[54:26] corner see them disciples had a message
[54:35] when they came out of the Upper Room do
[54:39] you have a message oh yeah I got a
[54:44] message God sent a prophet God sent a
[54:46] prophet amen now tell me what the
[54:49] Prophet taught praise God we believe
[54:53] that God sent a prophet
[54:55] what do you saw him now if you saw him
[54:58] said personal in front of you and him
[54:59] preaching thank God but you know that
[55:03] didn't convert you you say yeah I got
[55:10] the Holy Ghost right it takes the word
[55:14] being quickened to be the birth so just
[55:20] don't base it on I saw the prophet or
[55:22] ate with the Prophet so you can't do
[55:24] that even though everybody in this
[55:27] building I myself would have loved to
[55:28] have been tonight but I do also know
[55:32] that it wouldn't have changed me one bit
[55:37] why because I know now what the birth is
[55:41] I might have had trouble with it back I
[55:43] hurt but I know now what the birth is as
[55:47] newborn babes
[55:49] first Peter two cauldrons cornerstone
[55:53] people birth of the word on the day of
[55:57] Pentecost now if that be true and I'll
[56:03] leave that as a question to you is it
[56:06] true that the new birth is the birth of
[56:08] the word surely you're not going to go
[56:12] to anything incorruptible and try to
[56:15] bring a birth that's why I read that in
[56:17] first Peter
[56:18] I mean first if first Peter 1:22 and 23
[56:25] being born again that's what's happening
[56:30] this new birth starts us and then we're
[56:34] being born again through the birth of
[56:39] the word because we know for a certainty
[56:46] the hour the day that we're living that
[56:51] what happened in this day jump across
[56:54] with us now the South was lost apart
[56:58] they the word went into the ground and
[57:00] everything you know the bugs ate it down
[57:03] but remember there was one thing the
[57:06] books never ate down
[57:10] they never ate the new birth away
[57:14] now come on you can go I'll give you a
[57:17] quote I'll help you find that cuz I know
[57:18] what brother Brown said I look lad to
[57:21] help you find it
[57:22] that it sounds exactly like he said that
[57:26] they lost that that they lost that new
[57:30] birth they lost that he turned a lot it
[57:32] sounds just like it but now you tell me
[57:34] it is and I'll tell you they somethin
[57:35] wrong with you you know what arguing
[57:38] with a prophet you're just not listening
[57:40] to what he's saying the new birth is the
[57:47] birth of the word uh-huh
[57:51] spoken words original seeds paragraph
[57:53] 151 the birth of the word is Christ you
[58:04] must be born again the birth is the word
[58:09] it's the word that's made alive and you
[58:12] and I to give us a new birth then the
[58:14] headstone capstone whatever you want to
[58:17] call it would have to be the word made
[58:21] alive to the church
[58:26] that's why brother branham had to start
[58:29] where he did but I tried to get you to
[58:33] see that Sunday it doesn't say when he
[58:38] walked out there on the river he doesn't
[58:42] say what we say it says the voice said
[58:47] as John the Baptist forerun the first
[58:50] coming he had her message to introduce
[58:54] right the Messiah says your message will
[58:59] forerun the second coming so then he was
[59:03] gonna have to have a message he had to
[59:08] have a message and they had to be
[59:10] something in the Bible that was not
[59:12] preached of mankind that would be that
[59:15] message but it's got to be in the Bible
[59:19] Code as I said I want to go see you try
[59:21] to add anything to it then you're off
[59:22] the word remember that's what they said
[59:28] to brother Branham said with your
[59:30] ability you could write he said that be
[59:31] adding to the word you can't do that he
[59:35] said it was what was in the word and
[59:38] we're quoting it correct what was in the
[59:41] word that light had never shined upon
[59:43] what was in the word that light had
[59:45] never shined on
[59:48] then you'll see what brother ins message
[59:51] was his message would not be in addition
[59:56] to the word it cannot be a profit cannot
[59:59] add to the word no more than anybody
[1:00:02] else can add to the word it has to be
[1:00:05] already in the word a part of the world
[1:00:08] but lighted not shined upon that
[1:00:20] so then if the new birth is the birth of
[1:00:24] the word and Israel rejected that word
[1:00:29] they rejected the Messiah they turned
[1:00:32] down the baptism of the holy ghost but
[1:00:35] it still came and came upon the early
[1:00:38] church at Pentecost being the chief
[1:00:40] Cornerstone are the revealed Word that
[1:00:46] was made alive and Peter says and that's
[1:00:48] what I love Peter comes over in his
[1:00:50] message introducing the fact code of
[1:00:52] showing the he had a message come on you
[1:00:55] got the baptism of the Holy Ghost you
[1:00:57] got a message what did Prophet say
[1:01:01] what's gonna go out here and get my
[1:01:03] degrees in it he said no he said go tell
[1:01:07] him how the candle got lit there's your
[1:01:12] message don't know what's within this
[1:01:16] man is what to be broke that's been made
[1:01:19] known to me but that has nothing to do
[1:01:21] with you it's only the basis that I'm
[1:01:26] trying my best to get you to see the
[1:01:28] Word of God has got to be revealed to
[1:01:30] you not cause mama done it daddy done it
[1:01:34] my wife's good that's better than that
[1:01:37] ain't it
[1:01:39] where's the matches you've got them
[1:01:44] discipled had a message I'm asking read
[1:01:47] acts 2:1 and over in the tooth Peter had
[1:01:52] a message and this is what I live he
[1:01:54] said this is that right this is that
[1:02:02] that was spoken of by the prophets that
[1:02:08] was his message he was standing there
[1:02:10] with something alive within him
[1:02:14] it's what you have a live or just dead
[1:02:17] letter
[1:02:27] but if
[1:02:31] I'll put that back how to leave in your
[1:02:33] laughs if you can see the new birth was
[1:02:39] and how always have been the birth of
[1:02:44] the word you see what Luther would
[1:02:48] already a convert what it will call him
[1:02:53] whatever he was probably a great man
[1:02:55] walking in the light of he was riding
[1:02:58] great theses and preaching great
[1:03:00] messages but all that want something
[1:03:02] come alive is this message alive - you
[1:03:12] know he was allowed to read random we
[1:03:14] don't have to do nothing that's what
[1:03:15] that man said that time I'm throwing
[1:03:18] over God I simply preached a little
[1:03:21] message you've heard me tell it and said
[1:03:22] this is my revelation let's see if what
[1:03:27] brother Brennan says will compare to
[1:03:28] that that brother he and I used to he
[1:03:31] used to eat in our home we used to be
[1:03:32] together weekly I mean we're just
[1:03:34] anything I needed with his and I had a
[1:03:38] little car problem wouldn't run one time
[1:03:40] and he said take my big ol Buick and
[1:03:42] grouted jeffersonville because that's
[1:03:43] where we was going
[1:03:44] that's no I can't do it he said no I'll
[1:03:46] take my car
[1:03:48] he was just a great guy but you know
[1:03:50] what he said
[1:03:51] he sent me word he said brother Dale
[1:03:54] don't know how no more do with it you
[1:03:56] know forget it
[1:03:57] something to that degree he's because
[1:04:01] you said you had a revelation he said I
[1:04:03] got a revelation that brought around
[1:04:04] zone once got a revelation I didn't get
[1:04:08] mad and upset with him I thought that
[1:04:11] the human intelligence of a man should
[1:04:16] not have been that dumb not like a
[1:04:22] no-joke of the man I loved him but the
[1:04:26] human intelligence you know what I mean
[1:04:28] human intelligence what did I say I said
[1:04:32] I had a revelation and let's see if what
[1:04:35] brother Branham says compares with that
[1:04:38] revelation I said I had a revelation he
[1:04:41] said I don't have a revelation my
[1:04:45] revelation is that brother branham's the
[1:04:48] only ones got the revelation well he
[1:04:50] said he had a revelation ha oh the
[1:04:56] argument with me about it I said I had
[1:04:58] one he said he had one this is a church
[1:05:02] that's where we don't think we do okay
[1:05:05] but listen what is it in the Bible where
[1:05:12] is it in the Bible the headstone message
[1:05:22] cuz we get over in the scriptures and
[1:05:24] wanted to he send a headstone crying
[1:05:26] grace grace right he said the messenger
[1:05:34] would have to have a message in the end
[1:05:35] time you see those are quotes coming
[1:05:40] from a prophet about his message and I
[1:05:42] gave you up this quote after quote still
[1:05:44] got him laying here before said not in
[1:05:49] the years of preparation but said when
[1:05:52] he began to sound said not in the years
[1:05:55] of the healing campaigns but the message
[1:05:58] that followed the healing campaign
[1:06:02] litterin said knowing all alone this
[1:06:05] message would come and here it is and he
[1:06:10] said and I've been preaching it 30 years
[1:06:17] come on
[1:06:18] was he with me Sunday spoken words
[1:06:24] original seed read the message and
[1:06:28] listened to the tape letter and preached
[1:06:31] his message up to so far in stocks that
[1:06:32] said lord I can't go no further I got
[1:06:35] him out on a limb I'm quoting him the
[1:06:40] Holy Spirit says pick up your pen and
[1:06:43] ride went right back and I asked you to
[1:06:45] do that read that to the church it was
[1:06:47] exactly showing he was standing on the
[1:06:49] word he was showing God was showing
[1:06:53] brother Branham that what he had
[1:06:54] preached was exactly right that's why I
[1:06:58] get so sick of those people that believe
[1:07:00] that brother Branham was correct after
[1:07:02] the seals broke but before the seals you
[1:07:04] can't believe what he preached I deny
[1:07:07] that on the basis of God's Word that
[1:07:09] ain't even common sense how could you
[1:07:12] have God's Word part truth and then it
[1:07:15] finally come out to real truth it was
[1:07:17] the word all the time
[1:07:18] it was just not understood or not see
[1:07:28] didn't we know that Jesus done something
[1:07:31] that mankind never knew anything about
[1:07:34] he preached six seals in Matthew 24
[1:07:43] right but where did anybody say anything
[1:07:47] about that or did any Paul Peter any of
[1:07:51] say anything about it
[1:07:54] you don't listen it's like I've tried to
[1:07:57] get you to think about it Matthew Mark
[1:08:00] Luke and John talked to the son of man
[1:08:02] come on they wrote what Jesus told them
[1:08:04] but you show me one of them after then
[1:08:06] that mentioned son of man tell me one
[1:08:11] writing after the Matthew Mark Luke and
[1:08:13] John that Paul or any of them talked
[1:08:15] about the Son of Man they didn't see it
[1:08:21] were did any of them preach anything
[1:08:24] about Jesus preach in the field and
[1:08:27] worded brother Branham in his early
[1:08:29] ministry until he preached the seals I
[1:08:34] invite you see if you can find word
[1:08:38] before he preached the seals up in 263
[1:08:41] there in jeffersonville that was his
[1:08:43] first time of mentioning as far as I've
[1:08:46] been able to find of Matthew 24 and that
[1:08:51] Jesus had preached six seals oh yeah he
[1:08:54] read scriptures about it he said some
[1:08:55] things about cuz you know what we could
[1:08:57] Baptist we could Baptist used to preach
[1:09:00] that Matthew 24 or 24 22 23 24 somewhere
[1:09:04] and I it's in 24 that the sixth seal you
[1:09:09] know the tribulation we've had this
[1:09:11] preached that the Tribulation Period was
[1:09:14] Matthew 24 you heard me tell it I told
[1:09:19] him an artwork one day they were making
[1:09:21] light of us calling us buzzards
[1:09:26] because we'd they said they're they
[1:09:28] think their Eagles if someone said the
[1:09:29] other buzzards I said hey look folks I
[1:09:32] know a little bit more about this and
[1:09:33] you think I do I said there's 40
[1:09:35] something different Eagles they are
[1:09:36] vulture eagles so don't go around
[1:09:38] hollering all about this stuff
[1:09:40] oh they call me everything they even
[1:09:43] call me as she you know that I was to
[1:09:48] ahead of all of them told me a
[1:09:54] homosexual or forgive me for using the
[1:09:58] word but you know what that didn't make
[1:10:00] me mad at nobody I never said a word
[1:10:05] this one preacher Pentecostal preacher
[1:10:08] he was life in one day and he said yeah
[1:10:10] I said that's where them vulture eagles
[1:10:12] dire in the scripture I said I want to
[1:10:15] ask you brother one time I said where
[1:10:19] that scripture talks about to come into
[1:10:20] the son of man I said is it is it not
[1:10:23] true that you teach in your doctrine in
[1:10:27] your church
[1:10:28] that that is their coming the end of the
[1:10:31] world and the coming of the Messiah he
[1:10:37] just stopped he froze and he looked at
[1:10:40] me he said I'll never say out another
[1:10:43] word about you because I knew the church
[1:10:48] world talk Matthew there of the going up
[1:10:51] over into worth the carcass is the
[1:10:53] Eagles be gathered that they talked that
[1:10:55] is the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:10:59] until the day I left at work I never he
[1:11:01] never said another word about us now
[1:11:06] faced him with the word now listen you
[1:11:12] remember the pyramid message you
[1:11:16] remember the the seeing of the tone and
[1:11:19] seeing how that he took a bar and
[1:11:21] whipped to top off and look down in and
[1:11:24] he's seen things in her that light had
[1:11:26] never shined upon it is it not that he
[1:11:29] related that to the seals of the when he
[1:11:31] gets to the seals message well that that
[1:11:36] was what it was lot had never shined on
[1:11:38] no seals in Matthew 24
[1:11:43] so there's your headstone the opening of
[1:11:48] those seven seals not let her pay on the
[1:11:52] page
[1:11:52] revealing okay
[1:11:56] we're way behind on it with brothers can
[1:11:58] y'all catch up to the number eight I
[1:12:01] hadn't asked him to even use it on most
[1:12:04] of these we've used them over and over
[1:12:05] but can you catch up to number eight
[1:12:09] let's see if I can follow it they had a
[1:12:15] lot of reading on this one so I'll hang
[1:12:16] on
[1:12:16] and then God takes his messenger this is
[1:12:20] all for the first seal all right
[1:12:23] 1963 takes his messenger with the elect
[1:12:27] of that age and lays them aside asleep
[1:12:29] and then he drops a plague upon them who
[1:12:31] rejected a temporary judgment then after
[1:12:34] that is over then he goes on they
[1:12:36] denominated and bring in denominations
[1:12:38] and start off with that man's work like
[1:12:40] of Wesley and all the rest of them then
[1:12:42] it go gets in a group scrapple again and
[1:12:48] then another mystery comes forth then
[1:12:52] what happens another messenger arrives
[1:12:54] on the earth for a church age so each
[1:12:58] church age gets a message and a
[1:13:00] messenger right then when he arrives he
[1:13:03] the trumpet sounds he declares war see
[1:13:06] and then what happens finally then he's
[1:13:10] called away and then when he's laid away
[1:13:13] then plague plague falls destroys them
[1:13:17] spiritual death hits the church and
[1:13:19] she's gone that group then he goes on to
[1:13:22] another one
[1:13:24] and it's a great plan until it comes to
[1:13:27] the last angel now he has no certain
[1:13:31] mystery listen to it but he gathers up
[1:13:36] all that's been lost in them other ages
[1:13:40] all the truths that wasn't truly
[1:13:42] revealed yet see as the revelation come
[1:13:46] then he reveals those things in his day
[1:13:48] if you want to read it there it is
[1:13:50] revelations 10 one two one two four you
[1:13:52] get it now let's stop this says this the
[1:13:54] word
[1:13:57] I said it while ago on the Ohio River he
[1:14:01] didn't say you heart Attorney you'll
[1:14:03] turn the hearts of the children back to
[1:14:05] the fathers etc that wasn't said on Ohio
[1:14:07] River he said your message will forerun
[1:14:11] the second coming then he goes on to
[1:14:15] explain malachi for melikhaya forced to
[1:14:18] do two things turn arts or the children
[1:14:21] back to the faith through the father and
[1:14:22] reveal the seven thunders which is
[1:14:24] revelation contained in the seven seals
[1:14:25] to be these two finally revealed mystery
[1:14:27] truth they literally turn our hearts
[1:14:28] back alright he's holding it here now
[1:14:35] that he's already preached it and he has
[1:14:43] okay takes a book and seals and breaks
[1:14:48] them and shows the seventh angel it's
[1:14:52] all got to be in order go back and read
[1:14:55] this it's all got to be in order before
[1:14:58] you can come to the seals that's what
[1:15:02] gets me as I said well ago people say
[1:15:04] brethren was wrong before the sealed and
[1:15:05] right after I challenge that on the
[1:15:07] basis of God's Word out on the internet
[1:15:09] anywhere you're at come and show me come
[1:15:13] and show me and I'll come back to this
[1:15:15] church and announce your name and who
[1:15:17] you was and how you straightened me out
[1:15:19] cuz I ain't worried about it you ain't
[1:15:21] coming
[1:15:21] you've got enough sense to know better
[1:15:24] than to come because you say brother
[1:15:27] Brown was wrong as early ministry that
[1:15:28] makes you a greater God didn't brother
[1:15:30] Branham could ever you know that make
[1:15:33] you God instead of a man because only
[1:15:35] God can straighten out a prophet what
[1:15:38] brother Branham had to straighten out he
[1:15:39] straightened out and what he didn't
[1:15:41] straighten out we better leave it alone
[1:15:46] that's sensible enough look what he does
[1:15:50] takes a book and seals and breaks them
[1:15:53] and shows a seventh angel for alone the
[1:15:56] mysteries of God for this alone what the
[1:16:00] seventh angel the mystery of God is the
[1:16:03] ministry of the seventh angel he's to
[1:16:07] return all back to the faith of the
[1:16:08] fathers then something happens
[1:16:11] come on read now we just got through the
[1:16:15] church ages with him even history proved
[1:16:17] it is the angel's message of the seventh
[1:16:19] church because that's where people came
[1:16:21] follow
[1:16:22] you got a have a seventh church age
[1:16:24] messenger brother Branham was not the
[1:16:26] seventh church messenger the seventh
[1:16:32] church age messenger with the baptism of
[1:16:34] the Holy Ghost you don't even know your
[1:16:37] message I'll be glad to sit down and
[1:16:43] talk with you about it if you don't know
[1:16:46] the message you got eight manifestations
[1:16:49] of God but you only got seven men if you
[1:16:53] don't place that correctly you sure miss
[1:16:56] the whole message and I don't worry
[1:16:58] because come on alright revealed all the
[1:17:02] mystery that's been the price all the
[1:17:03] things in the Pais revelation 10:1 that
[1:17:05] now remember in the days of the seventh
[1:17:08] angel his sounding forth blastin forth
[1:17:11] the gospel trumpet he is to finish all
[1:17:14] the mysteries of God just like here come
[1:17:17] forth in the early church age
[1:17:19] we'll get it after a while a doctrine
[1:17:22] then it become a sayin first then a
[1:17:24] doctrine and then it'll become a statute
[1:17:26] then become a church and through the
[1:17:30] Dark Ages and out of the Dark Ages come
[1:17:32] the first Reformation Lutheran bro and
[1:17:35] he brought with him all kinds of
[1:17:37] mysterious things that happened during
[1:17:40] the church age all back in dark and then
[1:17:44] but he never finished a role I don't
[1:17:46] know where we can hold it that point and
[1:17:48] I will remember one thing if you'll
[1:17:50] listen to what Wade's trying to brain
[1:17:51] there's the brother run says in a sealed
[1:17:54] book the third seal he said there's a
[1:17:56] mysterious part of justification
[1:17:59] mysterious part of sanctification a
[1:18:01] mysterious part of the baptism of the
[1:18:03] holy ghost that light had never shined
[1:18:04] on now is that what he's just said with
[1:18:08] Luton
[1:18:08] Luke had done the best he could do but
[1:18:11] he couldn't finish it he couldn't bring
[1:18:14] the message to completion then Along
[1:18:17] Came West through sanctification got
[1:18:19] some more of us still never finished it
[1:18:20] left loose ends ever worse such as
[1:18:23] sprinklin instead of baptism and Luther
[1:18:25] took Father Son and Holy Ghost instead
[1:18:26] of the Lord Jesus Christ all these
[1:18:28] different things that alone come to
[1:18:29] Pentecostal age with the baptism of the
[1:18:32] Holy Spirit and they cabbage down on
[1:18:34] that now there cannot be no more ages
[1:18:37] that's all of its that's the fill it out
[1:18:39] our the lady of sin age but then we
[1:18:42] found in the study of the scriptures
[1:18:45] that the messenger to the age come right
[1:18:47] at the end of the age and at the end of
[1:18:51] the age every time Paul comes at the end
[1:18:54] of the age we find out Iranians come at
[1:18:57] the end of the age Martin now listen
[1:19:00] what he's saying Martin into the age
[1:19:03] Luther at the end of the Catholic age
[1:19:05] and what Wesley at the end of Luther's
[1:19:10] age and Pentecost at the end of the age
[1:19:16] of sanctification through the baptism of
[1:19:18] the Holy Ghost and at the end of the
[1:19:21] Pentecostal age we are supposed to
[1:19:23] receive according to the word as God
[1:19:25] helped me to not to show you through
[1:19:27] here that we are to see it receive a
[1:19:29] messenger that will take all those loose
[1:19:32] ends out there and reveal the whole
[1:19:34] secret of God for the rap string of the
[1:19:37] church the messenger come to the end of
[1:19:41] the age now draw that out on a piece of
[1:19:44] paper and short term me

[1:19:55] how they come roll to bring that back
[1:19:56] down he just read it he just said it
[1:19:59] come on back down on down a little
[1:20:00] further huh
[1:20:02] they can't down Luther we found in
[1:20:06] the study of the scripture that the
[1:20:07] messenger to the age come right at the
[1:20:09] end of the age ever time see you think
[1:20:12] that Paul come right here and brought a
[1:20:17] message you know into the age if he come
[1:20:25] at the end of the age how did he bring
[1:20:26] the message to the church at Ephesus
[1:20:28] he'd have been bringing this message to
[1:20:30] the next age you're not even listening

[1:21:17] church in Ephesus he coming to end of
[1:21:22] Pentecost and brought the church message
[1:21:27] to Ephesus when it died and went in the
[1:21:31] ground Iranians picked it up at the end
[1:21:33] and bringing it forth I'm reading it to

[1:24:23] eternal life or you gonna have to have
[1:24:27] another messenger did I read it is this
[1:24:37] the way we want it or we don't want to
[1:24:38] do we want another message

[1:25:26] message of justification now am i right
[1:25:29] when I said Luther got Luther would
[1:25:31] already a converted believer but one day
[1:25:34] something struck he got his message that
[1:25:37] just shall live by faith
[1:25:39] John Wesley came to America to preach as
[1:25:42] a missionary to convert the Indians and
[1:25:45] wound up with meeting the Moravians or
[1:25:48] ever he pronounced that they were
[1:25:49] teaching sanctification he goes back
[1:25:51] home and he says hold I went to America
[1:25:54] to convert the Indian come and find out
[1:25:56] I had to be converted I got the message
[1:25:59] of sanctification he had a message when
[1:26:01] he went back home he was sailing across
[1:26:03] glory hallelujah we're Methodists we're
[1:26:06] going well glory we're good Methodists
[1:26:08] oh this all this happy and going back
[1:26:10] home he's gone ray he had a message
[1:26:14] Luther had a message Luther's manna was
[1:26:18] the message of justification Wes his
[1:26:20] message was the manifestation of
[1:26:22] sanctification Pentecost was the
[1:26:24] restoration of the gifts
[1:26:28] look but this is introducing the
[1:26:32] headstone the last day the bride tree
[1:26:35] which is contoured all of it and yet
[1:26:38] it's the same light for the material are
[1:26:42] you listening
[1:26:44] introducing the headstone all right go
[1:26:48] to the next one number 11 the voice of
[1:26:50] the sign we're told that in the last
[1:26:53] days that will repeat again there's
[1:26:55] going to be a message come forth that
[1:26:57] will introduce the Messiah to the people
[1:27:01] and it'll be in such a way they'll stand
[1:27:03] dumbfounded like they did then he
[1:27:06] promised it the next chapter of Matthew
[1:27:07] Malachi tells us about it huh
[1:27:11] introducing the Messiah Matthew 24 the
[1:27:21] opening of the seal to introduce the
[1:27:23] Messiah arsy headstone that way I can
[1:27:32] stand with all of the Bible in front of
[1:27:33] me and declare the cornerstone is the
[1:27:36] new birth the headstone is the birth of
[1:27:42] the word all the word so now I'm still
[1:27:46] saying the same time and I'm asking the
[1:27:51] question do you have the new birth cause
[1:27:53] if you don't have the new birth in ain't
[1:27:54] only the word about to rest in some old
[1:27:58] musician if you don't have the new birth
[1:28:00] is no need to worry about it let's get
[1:28:02] to new birth let's get Jesus Christ into
[1:28:05] our hearts and then we worry about it
[1:28:08] you know what these things will become
[1:28:10] to understanding yeah but I just don't
[1:28:13] understand well read it but you're gonna
[1:28:15] read it well yeah mmm and I just don't
[1:28:19] see that will explain it did the
[1:28:24] messenger come at the end of the age
[1:28:26] brother branham said every one of them
[1:28:28] did so then you know how Paul coming at
[1:28:31] the end of our of the first Ephesus if
[1:28:35] you're going that away and you'd have
[1:28:37] Iranians you'd have all these and you'd
[1:28:40] wind up in trouble
[1:28:42] but if you'll take it that's a messenger
[1:28:45] coming to end of the age
[1:28:47] all right hey we're gonna get the organ
[1:28:50] to working tonight huh okay George over
[1:28:53] here well alright well we'll get it to
[1:28:55] working well we got plenty of time
[1:28:57] well I'd worry about it okay what do you
[1:29:02] see what I'm talking about
[1:29:03] just think of the messenger come to the
[1:29:05] end of the age now there's one in here
[1:29:09] that I didn't get okay let me see if I
[1:29:12] can find it while they're playing a
[1:29:13] little bit and getting tuned let me see
[1:29:16] if I can find it when he begins to say
[1:29:24] Oh Jude
[1:29:26] yeah come on where we at
[1:29:41] well let me just give you this one from
[1:29:44] the message of the rapture and I must
[1:29:46] say it and my message all the time
[1:29:49] knowing back gar under healing and so
[1:29:53] forth like that
[1:29:54] was just to catch the people's attention
[1:29:57] knowing the message would come and here
[1:30:01] it is and then seven seals opened those
[1:30:05] mysteries and showing those things is
[1:30:08] what happened what I'm trying to find it
[1:30:10] I got it on here where brother Brennan
[1:30:12] says that the seals come down he said
[1:30:14] Moses brought two Commandments he calls
[1:30:17] the commandments the sealed you ever
[1:30:18] thought of that that's what he says that
[1:30:24] the commandments and the seals are the
[1:30:26] same time I wish to God I could get
[1:30:28] things back in my mind it's a lot of
[1:30:30] places I wish I could get that one back
[1:30:32] I saw marriage and divorce in it in the
[1:30:34] Ten Commandments I could read it I'll
[1:30:38] read right there this is beautiful in
[1:30:40] the Ten Commandments what about the
[1:30:43] first sealed first seal says that that
[1:30:45] there's just one true and living God
[1:30:46] right what is the first commandment they
[1:30:49] hold alizarin Lord our God is one and
[1:30:52] his name is one but around can make the
[1:30:55] seals and become the Ten Commandments to
[1:30:58] be the same thing but see that's where
[1:31:00] the troubling we think the Ten
[1:31:02] Commandments is a book of rules it is
[1:31:05] not is a revelation of Almighty God the
[1:31:11] Ten Commandments is not a book of rules
[1:31:15] it's a revelation of Almighty God God in
[1:31:19] letter form what are the seals
[1:31:23] revelation of God like I've always asked
[1:31:29] you to do go home and get that book set
[1:31:31] down the Luke and just read the books
[1:31:33] and the titles of the sermons after you
[1:31:35] get through brother Branham had always
[1:31:37] preached one true and living God
[1:31:39] why did he come back in there 63 after
[1:31:42] the opening of the seals and picked up
[1:31:44] the greatest message he ever he said it
[1:31:46] I didn't say he said that was the
[1:31:48] greatest message then he'd ever preached
[1:31:50] was Christ a mystery of God reveal read
[1:31:53] the message
[1:31:54] and when he did he said it that he said
[1:31:59] Jesus Christ was Almighty God he'd
[1:32:02] always taught it to him as I always told
[1:32:06] here said there the other day he always
[1:32:09] preached it melts as it was Almighty God
[1:32:11] go to 57 series of the other of the
[1:32:14] Hebrews he taught who Melchizedek was
[1:32:18] but I love what he said later one who is
[1:32:22] this milk's hesitate oh we know who that
[1:32:33] ask brother Branham
[1:32:34] you mean brother Brown was milchester no
[1:32:38] I don't agree no I don't think so
[1:32:44] but why would he say who is this bill
[1:32:47] charity Christ is the mystery of God
[1:32:50] reveal the future home the unveiling of
[1:32:55] God goes back a little while after then
[1:32:58] preaches a message says the mighty God
[1:33:01] unveiled were in the people Oh see there
[1:33:11] was a message but Ron's message was the
[1:33:15] opening of those seven seals that's what
[1:33:17] he come to brain the other was
[1:33:19] restoration returned the faith of the
[1:33:21] father's bringing it back getting it all
[1:33:23] lined up you had to get that right
[1:33:24] before he could bring his message that's
[1:33:27] why he came at the end of the age he
[1:33:32] said if you make me I'm paraphrasing
[1:33:34] this from this close we said if you make
[1:33:36] me the messenger lady of seal makes it
[1:33:39] us see if you make me the seventh angel
[1:33:40] door something he said you make me the

[1:34:36] thing about it I'm gonna stand for this

[1:34:46] again if the new birth is the birth of
[1:34:49] the word did were not the headstone
[1:34:52] message be the birth of the word that a
[1:34:55] lot had not shined upon until the day

[1:35:02] leaving him you're trying to pack him in
[1:35:05] and not leaving him a message that was
