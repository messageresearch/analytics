[2:54] nervous um first I just want to start by
[2:58] um thanking brother and sister uro for
[3:01] um arranging everything and taking care
[3:04] of all of us and being the best tour
[3:07] guides um I want to thank my parents mom
[3:10] and dad for allowing me to
[3:12] go um I'm sorry so as you know we were
[3:17] supposed to um reach managa um Wednesday
[3:21] but um we only got to
[3:23] Houston and um um after we got out off
[3:27] the plane um we went in this line to see
[3:30] if we can um get another flight
[3:32] basically for that day or if they could
[3:34] schedule another flight and um everyone
[3:37] was just tired and hungry and just
[3:41] exhausted um I know and um the lesson I
[3:45] really learned from that was just
[3:47] putting it into the Lord's hands because
[3:49] we were like you know if it's if it's
[3:51] not your will Lord we won't go um maybe
[3:55] brother Louise and brother Bob can go
[3:56] but everyone else would just you know go
[3:58] home but um I really learned to just you
[4:01] know pray about and just put into the
[4:03] Lord's hands and he just makes a way and
[4:06] um that was that was a that was a real
[4:08] blessing um we so we um we got a flight
[4:13] for Friday and there was exactly you
[4:15] know eight seats and there was eight
[4:16] people so you know that was a real
[4:19] miracle and I just want to thank the
[4:20] Lord for that um in Nicaragua what um my
[4:25] gist of it was you know from washing
[4:27] dishes by hand and um being in Believers
[4:31] homes that didn't you know had um dirt
[4:33] flooring or um using out houses all I
[4:37] could see was just the happiness in
[4:40] their eyes and their hearts and how
[4:43] serious they were about the Lord how
[4:45] content they were and I just wish that
[4:48] we could be more like that you know um
[4:50] to have very little and still put God
[4:53] above
[4:54] everything and um I just love being with
[4:58] them the atmosphere the really sweet
[5:00] people s they're just wonderful brothers
[5:03] and sisters and honestly when Christine
[5:06] and them go back I'm on the next flly
[5:08] back it was just a real blessing and um
[5:12] putting all of these things into
[5:13] perspective has just moved my heart
[5:15] closer to the Lord and I was very
[5:17] humbled by this experience so thank you
[5:19] all for praying with us praying for us
[5:21] it was just a real blessing thank
[5:28] you
[5:32] amen I will now give my testimony of the
[5:35] trip
[5:37] um once again if anyone has a special
[5:39] don't be afraid to raise your
[5:41] hand uh actually I can start off with
[5:43] that that in Nicaragua almost every uh
[5:46] service we went to there was at least
[5:48] like four or five specialist so maybe we
[5:50] could think about
[5:52] that and just feel free to come up but
[5:57] um uh know I want to thank uh uh brother
[6:00] Lis Sister Christine for uh facilitating
[6:03] the whole trip you know allowing us to
[6:06] you know they know people and allowing
[6:08] us to go with them and and for the
[6:09] church and all the donations and
[6:11] everything that really helped out uh
[6:12] with the trip especially once start our
[6:15] flights got uh delayed and canceled and
[6:18] all that you know your money really kept
[6:20] us afloat that we were able to stay at a
[6:21] hotel you know and because God wanted us
[6:24] to go on this trip like in said there
[6:26] was only eight seats and sorry there was
[6:29] only eight
[6:30] seats and uh we were able to all eight
[6:32] of us were able to get on so like like
[6:34] Jala said that was really a miracle and
[6:36] God really wanted us to go so so thank
[6:40] you for your donations
[6:42] uh everyone if your first language is
[6:45] English please raise your
[6:47] hand that's wonderful okay I think we
[6:50] should all thank God that our first
[6:52] language first language is English
[6:54] because this message came in English and
[6:58] we're all able to easily read it read
[7:00] the tapes read the books listen to the
[7:03] message and and in different parts of
[7:05] the country where the the first language
[7:07] isn't English they need interpreters
[7:09] they need translators they need all
[7:11] these different we need they need people
[7:12] from here to go over there who know both
[7:14] languages many people like maybe brother
[7:16] Bob who only knows one language but he
[7:18] can't just go by himself and need
[7:19] someone like brother Louise and there's
[7:21] just so much more that there's so many
[7:23] more barriers that they have to go
[7:25] through to get to this message so we
[7:28] should just all be that grateful that
[7:29] that we happen to speak English and
[7:31] that's happen to be our first Lang we
[7:32] happen to be born in a english- speaking
[7:34] country where the message came English
[7:36] and that's why brother brandham says
[7:37] that America is going to get a a special
[7:40] you know punishment because we speak
[7:42] English the message came in English that
[7:43] we had an American
[7:45] prophet and and we have all this
[7:47] technology and all this all this access
[7:49] information and we just don't use it so
[7:51] we're going to get a special punishment
[7:52] if we don't grasp this word and really
[7:55] take hold of all the blessings that
[7:56] we've just been blessed with there's
[7:58] nothing of our own Merit we've just been
[7:59] born here and that's just it's it's
[8:02] incredible and we need to be thankful
[8:03] for that every day and I also want
[8:06] to talk about just uh something this
[8:09] trip made me really grateful for is the
[8:11] progress that the missionary field has
[8:13] made in in all the years because it's
[8:16] it's just you know when that scripture
[8:18] says that you know spread the gospel to
[8:19] the utmost parts of the earth you know
[8:21] and we go to this this this small little
[8:23] island where I mean there's one message
[8:26] Church on the entire island people have
[8:28] dirt houses you know they're washing
[8:30] clothes by hand they're washing
[8:32] everything by hand they're doing
[8:32] everything by hand there's no you they
[8:35] don't call a plumber they don't call a
[8:37] carpenter unless it's the guy around the
[8:39] around the street that they know that he
[8:41] works with wood but they they have so
[8:43] little and they're just so out of the
[8:45] way but the fact that we're able to get
[8:46] to them and minister to them and and
[8:49] fellowship with them it's it's it's
[8:51] truly a blessing so the the just the
[8:53] progress that the missionary field has
[8:55] made and my sister Nisa was saying
[8:57] they're all very friendly people even
[8:58] through the language area we're trying
[8:59] to understand them but they're very
[9:01] happy smiling up ready to talk to you
[9:05] it's incredible thing and and also the
[9:08] the progress of the missionary field is
[9:09] also my own personal testimony because
[9:12] you know a prophet one time went to
[9:15] Africa to do some some missionary work
[9:17] and that missionary work spread all the
[9:19] way to Zimbabwe where my method as
[9:22] grandfather had a a firstborn daughter
[9:25] who could then meet someone who was in
[9:26] the
[9:27] message and then comes me who I can also
[9:30] be bornn to the message and born you
[9:32] know under under the right atmosphere to
[9:34] receive the message as well so that's
[9:36] just the progress of that and how how
[9:38] much it spread and that's why that's why
[9:41] we're called to spread the gospel we're
[9:42] called to you know whoever we run into
[9:45] we need to need to try and get that word
[9:46] out and that's how we're going to that's
[9:49] how we're going to get out of here is
[9:50] making sure every every child every
[9:52] every person of God gets that new birth
[9:54] gets that experience climb the statue of
[9:56] perfect man comes to Perfection and then
[9:57] we can all leave so that's why we need
[9:59] to continue the missionary field so I'm
[10:01] very grateful for that and also just um
[10:06] just to know that you know we have
[10:07] brothers and sisters everywhere and that
[10:08] we all know each other you know by by
[10:11] the spirit you know even brother brandom
[10:13] said you can talk to someone and you can
[10:14] figure out that whether or not they're a
[10:16] Christian within five minutes so and
[10:18] just to be able to talk to people and
[10:19] even through the language barrier we can
[10:20] understand that they're you know
[10:21] Spirit-filled Christians Spirit fill
[10:23] Believers so it's good to know them so I
[10:25] think that fits well with the song I
[10:27] want to sing which is they will know we
[10:29] are Christians by our
[10:35] love we are one in the spirit we are one
[10:41] in the Lord we are one in the spirit we
[10:47] are one in the Lord and we pray that all
[10:53] Unity will one day be restored and

[14:50] at um many years ago and I saying it to
[14:54] the girls I said this is my testimony
[14:57] and I want to get emotional cu iist um
[14:59] testimony meant a lot to me and I know
[15:01] God's love is real and salvation is real
[15:05] and he really did save me I mean I was a
[15:06] real sinner I'm just being honest I
[15:09] dressed bad I talk bad I cussed I did
[15:11] everything you know I didn't do drugs
[15:13] and stuff like that but I was out there
[15:14] you know dressing bad was dressing good
[15:16] to me you know I didn't know any better
[15:18] I cut all my hair off you
[15:20] know if you saw somebody like well she's
[15:22] unsavable you know one time John his
[15:25] daddy had us to go down to um to make in
[15:27] Georgia to deliver some money for his
[15:29] dad for somebody down there for a job or
[15:31] some pick up some money and we went down
[15:33] there and these Christian folks took us
[15:34] out to eat they were so kind to me I
[15:37] didn't know there were message Believers
[15:38] or anything just took us out got some
[15:39] ribs and everything just treated us so
[15:42] good and I had my pants on I was just
[15:44] you know just worldly but they were so
[15:45] sweet to me I didn't know what was
[15:46] different about them but now they're
[15:48] message Believers maybe they prayed for
[15:50] me so I'm just grateful for their
[15:52] kindness so you never know who you're
[15:53] meeting like how they look or don't
[15:55] judge people how they look don't judge a
[15:57] book by its cover you don't know like
[15:59] what's in their heart you know I know in
[16:01] my heart like I always want to be clean
[16:03] and that's what draw me to this message
[16:05] it's like we went to like some kind of
[16:07] little fake church I just call it that
[16:09] before we end up com to the message he
[16:10] was raising the message and I came to
[16:12] and I just couldn't hear it they're like
[16:13] we need to dress better I was look like
[16:14] what these other girls dressing bad I'm
[16:16] going to continue and how I need to
[16:18] dress but when I heard the true word of
[16:20] the message like I knew that this was a
[16:22] true salvation for a woman to wear a
[16:24] dress like you know like the 100% way
[16:26] like not 60% not 40% not 10% and I want
[16:30] to encourage every sister and brother to
[16:32] keep your
[16:33] Purity if there's one thing I cry out
[16:35] for keep your Purity it's worth so much
[16:39] it's so beautiful for a young man and
[16:41] young woman to keep themselves in the
[16:43] Lord and say bathe and clean in his

[20:17] sin and darkness from
[20:20] [Music]
[20:23] me oh how much he

[20:34] me every
[20:36] day he comes to
[20:39] me with new
[20:44] Assurance more and more I
[20:49] understand his words of Love Yes
[20:54] Lord but I'll never know just why he
[21:00] came to save
[21:04] me till
[21:07] some I see his
[21:10] face Lord this is the truth y'all I want
[21:15] my girls to know him I want my children
[21:17] to know him and who to truth he saved me
[21:20] I don't want them to go through all the
[21:22] trials there's no need there just no

[22:09] sin and darkness from
[22:12] [Music]
[22:15] me oh how much he cared for
[22:26] me
[22:35] but you know it was even better when she
[22:37] stuck her testimony into that when you
[22:40] plug yourself into these songs is what
[22:41] they don't just write them and fill up
[22:43] paper it's got to mean something and
[22:46] when they got the inspiration to write
[22:48] it God was telling that writer to put it
[22:51] on paper so that sister Alicia can sing
[22:52] it today that's the way I see the thing
[22:56] the the inspiration I SW I like
[22:59] specials cuz it comes from your heart
[23:01] not everybody's singing it comes from
[23:03] your heart it's a special God put on
[23:04] your heart to sing to the people well
[23:06] that thought was before the foundation
[23:07] of the world we think all every we
[23:10] always think brother John well the
[23:11] preacher the preaching preaching is
[23:13] number one we know that but thank God
[23:16] for inspired songwriters like we were
[23:18] talking about John and Charles Wesley
[23:20] Charles Wesley you know John Wesley was
[23:21] a messenger to the church age but
[23:23] Charles Wesley wrote 6,000 songs right
[23:26] and they weren't Boogie wogie
[23:28] for those of you that know what Boogie
[23:30] wogie is that's rock music and all that
[23:32] other stuff no he wrote 6,000 songs that
[23:35] you and I can connect to God with amen
[23:39] through song that's why David the
[23:40] psalmist
[23:42] David was a man after God's Own Heart
[23:44] because he sang and those evil spirits
[23:47] just go away from you'll try that
[23:48] sometime have a bad have a bad day start
[23:51] singing don't sing what you heard on the

[30:13] sir you know when I was in the Army many
[30:14] many year ago I was up at Fort Brag with
[30:16] the 18th Airborne Corps up there
[30:18] Airborne artillery and it gave me a a
[30:21] Ste pot they gave me an M16 rifle they
[30:24] gave me a m203 grenade launcher that was
[30:26] mounted under underneath my 16 they gave
[30:28] me combat boots they gave me a backpack
[30:30] they gave me all this stuff to fight
[30:32] with but they never gave me a promise
[30:35] that I would
[30:37] win no they didn't they said go in there
[30:39] you know good
[30:41] luck but in God's
[30:43] Army he gave us the helmet of salvation
[30:46] amen he shot our feet with the
[30:48] preparation of the gospel and he gave us
[30:51] the promise we win yes he did praise the
[30:55] lord well if you have your BBL this even
[30:57] turn with us to the book of Matthews I
[30:58] want to read from Matthews chapter 27
[31:01] starting at verse 15 we greet you in the
[31:03] name of the Lord Jesus and I was
[31:05] supposed to be in the nicara Nicaragua
[31:08] meetings myself this year but my wife
[31:11] was in an automobile accident and total
[31:13] the car and she suffered a concussion
[31:15] and some some back injury and I I just I
[31:18] just couldn't leave My Little Queen so
[31:20] uh so we uh canceled and didn't go but I
[31:23] heard the meetings was really good and
[31:24] we're just just grateful for those that
[31:26] were able to go and if you've never been
[31:28] there it is a humbling experience uh
[31:31] just precious precious people you know
[31:32] brother said about the Spanish people
[31:34] said they get their healing because
[31:36] they're willing to eat the crumbs and
[31:38] just just a real humble people that that
[31:41] would have been my 15th trip I think
[31:43] there to Nicaragua but I've been there
[31:45] with brother Luis before just really
[31:47] good people there and I'm sorry we
[31:49] couldn't get to go but I've certainly
[31:50] heard some good reports from the meeting
[31:52] so we're thankful for that I want to
[31:54] read now from Matthew chapter 27
[31:56] starting at vers verse 15 and I know I
[31:59] spit a little bit when I preached but I
[32:00] didn't realize I spit that bad
[32:01] everybody's sitting towards the back
[32:04] so I'll try to watch it y'all move a
[32:07] little bit closer in the morning and
[32:08] I'll try to watch it no just kidding
[32:11] just kidding Matthew 27 starting at 15
[32:14] do you love him amen the Bible says
[32:18] this now at the feast the governor was
[32:21] want to release unto the people a
[32:23] prisoner whom they would and they had
[32:26] then an mble prisoner called
[32:28] barabus and therefore when they were
[32:30] gathered together pilate said unto them
[32:33] whom will ye that I release unto you
[32:36] barabus or Jesus which is called Christ
[32:40] for he knew that for Envy they had
[32:43] delivered him and when he was sat down
[32:45] on the Judgment seat his wife sent to
[32:47] him saying how thou nothing to do with
[32:49] this just man for I've suffered many
[32:51] things this day in a dream because of
[32:54] him but the chief priests and the elders
[32:56] pursu persuaded the multitude be careful
[32:59] who persuades you the chief priests and
[33:02] the elders persuaded the multitude that
[33:04] they should ask barabus and Destroy
[33:08] Jesus and the governor answered and said
[33:11] unto them whether of the twain will ye
[33:13] that I release unto you and they said
[33:16] barabus and pilate said unto them what
[33:19] shall I do then with Jesus which is
[33:21] called Christ and they all said unto him
[33:25] let him be
[33:27] crucified and the governor said why what
[33:31] evil hath he done but they cried out the
[33:34] more saying let him be crucified and
[33:38] when pilate saw that he could Prevail
[33:39] nothing but rather a tumet was made and
[33:42] he took water and washed his hands
[33:44] before the multitude saying I am
[33:46] innocent of the blood of this just
[33:49] person but you see the prophet Tau us
[33:51] the only way to get his blood off of
[33:53] your hands is to receive it into your
[33:55] heart I'm innocent of the blood of this
[33:58] just person see ye to it then answered
[34:01] all the people and said his blood be on
[34:04] us and on our children then released he
[34:08] barabus unto them and when he had
[34:10] scourged Jesus he delivered him to be
[34:14] crucified let us bow our heads I want to
[34:18] speak to you for a few minutes this

[36:00] things in Jesus name and the bride says
[36:03] amen God bless you you may be
[36:08] seated
[36:10] amen as our scriptures open this
[36:15] afternoon we find ourself in a Roman
[36:20] prison
[36:21] house now come with me for just a few
[36:24] minutes in your mind right let's take
[36:27] this little trip back to this Roman
[36:31] prison and as we make our way down the
[36:34] hall of this pest House of a
[36:37] prison we come to realize that we are
[36:41] making our way down death
[36:44] row that these are the cells of the
[36:47] prisoners of Rome who have been
[36:50] sentenced to death for their crimes
[36:53] against Rome right can you can you
[36:57] imagine the
[36:59] smell the the unsanitary conditions and
[37:03] the the the the rats and no good food
[37:05] and no good water because after all
[37:08] these men are condemned to
[37:10] death so there's no use to try to
[37:13] preserve their life when they've been
[37:15] condemned to die but let me say this
[37:19] afternoon that every person born on this
[37:22] Earth was born under a sentence of death
[37:27] we were if you will we were born on
[37:30] death row for David said behold I was
[37:33] shaped in iniquity and did and in sin
[37:36] did my mother conceive me from the
[37:40] moment that we were conceived we are on
[37:43] our path to death you know many people
[37:47] today they have this idea I don't need
[37:49] nobody I don't need no friends I I I
[37:52] don't need no help I'm doing all right
[37:54] by myself I'm I'm smart and and I I I
[37:57] I've got money and I can figure it out
[37:59] and I I can make my own way but you see
[38:02] the prophet of God said you were born
[38:05] defeated right and that birth can never
[38:08] bring you to life that's right people
[38:11] strive so hard to be famous or to be
[38:13] popular or to be a movie star but nine
[38:16] times out of 10 most of those people end
[38:18] up with their lives destroyed right
[38:22] Katie Spade that people spends thousands
[38:25] of dollars to buy a Katie Spade purse
[38:28] what did Katie Spade do hang herself in
[38:31] a hotel room oh my Robin Williams a
[38:34] comedian that made everybody laugh and
[38:37] everybody what did he do hung your in a
[38:40] hotel room right because we're born
[38:43] defeated and there's nothing that we can
[38:45] ever do within oursel that would ever
[38:48] bring us to life the prophet said you're
[38:50] in a defeated World amongst defeated
[38:53] people amongst defeated Creeds and
[38:55] defeated denomination
[38:57] but you've got to come to Victory
[38:59] somehow and before there can ever be a
[39:02] victory there must be a
[39:06] Victor but you see man was not born that
[39:10] way man was meant to be born
[39:13] free but now we find them that these men
[39:17] here on death row that they have been
[39:19] sentenced to die by
[39:22] crucifixion one of the most horrible
[39:24] forms of death that there
[39:27] were oh friends it's terrible what sin
[39:31] can do to
[39:33] you you know brother R talked about an
[39:35] eagle that was in a cage and they said
[39:38] that eagle had just been captured and it
[39:40] was one of the most pitiful SS that I
[39:42] ever had the privilege of seeing he said
[39:45] that great Heavenly bird had been
[39:47] captured and netted by someone and
[39:49] thrown into a cage and that poor fellow
[39:52] was so out of place that he would jump
[39:55] with all with there was within him
[39:57] against those big bars flopping his
[39:59] wings only to find himself to fall back
[40:01] on his back and he said then that poor
[40:03] Eagle had beat himself against those
[40:05] bars until all his feathers was beat off
[40:07] from his wings and his head and his face
[40:10] was bruised and he said I watched him
[40:12] again proudly walked back and with all
[40:14] that was in him he poured himself
[40:15] against the bars only to find himself
[40:18] knocked backwards again right but he
[40:20] said that eagle he wouldn't quit because
[40:23] he was out of place he didn't belong
[40:25] there right he wanted to be free he was
[40:29] born to be free there was something in
[40:31] him that told him this ain't who you
[40:33] really
[40:35] are oh my SS of God let me say this
[40:38] afternoon I'm not going to quit if I get
[40:41] knocked down I'm going to get back up if
[40:43] I fail I'm going to ask forgiveness but
[40:45] I'm not going to quit because I don't
[40:46] belong here I come from somewhere else
[40:49] amen I come from God I must go back to
[40:54] God Prophet said as he laid there on
[40:57] that floor and those weary eyes soared
[40:58] the skies he said I thought what a
[41:00] pitiful sight made not to be on the
[41:03] earth here he's a Heavenly bird his
[41:05] whole makeup was to live in the blue way
[41:07] above the honks and the cares of this
[41:09] world but to see a bird like that that
[41:12] was made up borned into Earth to soar
[41:16] the skies right yet caged in such a way
[41:21] that he could never soar the skies again
[41:25] oh my a prisoner in a
[41:29] manmade
[41:31] cage a
[41:33] prisoner and the prophet said as he laid
[41:36] there looking at that place where he had
[41:37] been made born the
[41:39] sore he would not give up because
[41:43] something inside of him kept telling him
[41:45] I don't belong here right and maybe
[41:48] you're sitting here this
[41:50] afternoon you're singing the
[41:53] songs and you the song service and you
[41:55] was a part of of it and singing the
[41:57] songs and you're looking at a place and
[41:59] something in your heart is telling you
[42:02] this is where you
[42:03] belong this is where you belong maybe
[42:05] you've never surrendered to God in your
[42:07] life and maybe you've just been but
[42:09] something you keep hearing the songs and
[42:11] the testimonies and the sister she
[42:13] poured out her heart and something keeps
[42:15] telling you this is where I belong this
[42:17] is what I'm missing in my
[42:19] life and that ego you know he thought
[42:22] this this is not where I belong this is
[42:24] not what I was born to be
[42:26] but by the cun of man this Eagle had
[42:29] been CED for life and the prophet said
[42:31] what a pitiful sight it is but I tell
[42:33] you something friends something more
[42:34] pitiful than that is to see men and
[42:36] women who were born and shaped in the
[42:38] image of God to be Sons and Daughters of
[42:41] God to be find them caged by sin and
[42:45] habits and the cares of this world I'm
[42:47] not talking about just the ones out
[42:49] there in the barroom I'm talking about
[42:50] the ones that set Among Us on message
[42:52] fuse and yet they're still
[42:55] caged
[42:57] it's far more pitiful than that eagle
[42:59] man was not made to be bound man is a
[43:02] free man whom the son ha made free is
[43:05] free
[43:06] indeed man doesn't have to be bound like
[43:10] that oh my the different things that
[43:12] cages men and deny them of their
[43:15] god-given privileges manmade manmade in
[43:19] the image of his God he doesn't have to
[43:22] be a he doesn't have to be bound a slave
[43:25] to Satan he wasn't made to be a
[43:29] slave he was made to be a Son of God God
[43:32] made man in his own image
[43:35] amen as we move down this Hall we come
[43:40] to sell number
[43:43] five this cell belongs to the most
[43:46] feared probably the meanest man in the
[43:49] region his name is
[43:52] barabus he actually his name is Jesus
[43:55] barabus
[43:56] right which means barabus means son of
[44:00] the
[44:00] father this man was a murderer he was a
[44:04] thief he was a credible but all of his
[44:07] meanness and his evilness had caught up
[44:09] with him and now he was going to pay the
[44:12] price and let me say young people you
[44:14] may think you're getting away with it
[44:16] you may think that what you're doing
[44:18] that nobody knows that you're doing it
[44:20] but I want you to understand this
[44:22] afternoon there is an allseeing eye
[44:25] watching every every one of
[44:27] us and there is a payday that's coming
[44:31] for be assured if we s it we will also
[44:34] so reap it
[44:35] amen this man barabus who had brought
[44:38] such fear upon the people when you
[44:41] mentioned his name people were scared to
[44:43] death of the name of barabus yes but
[44:46] this man who had brought such fear and
[44:48] such
[44:49] distress now he was feeling it himself
[44:54] all right the the prophet said all night
[44:57] long he walked up and down that jail
[44:59] pulling his hair for the next morning he
[45:01] would go to a cross capital punishment
[45:04] he would die and how the nightmares
[45:06] passed over him that night and how he
[45:08] couldn't rest knowing the agony and the
[45:11] pain that he would soon face death by
[45:15] crucifixion you see where sin had
[45:17] brought him
[45:19] to that's what sin had brought him
[45:22] to oh he thought he's having him a big

[54:55] soldiers and Spears glit walking up
[54:57] there and that big Jailer turns the key

[55:04] when you heard the Romans coming with
[55:06] those big Galleries and the Big Iron
[55:07] shoes are stopping alone chains are
[55:09] outling Spears dragging on the street to
[55:11] know he's going to be killed when he

[55:14] and cried ready to run saying this is
[55:17] the end of
[55:18] me and now we see him are you still with
[55:21] me and now you see him we see here
[55:25] Jesus we see pilate Jesus is on the
[55:29] right hand bar RAB is on Pilot's left
[55:32] standing before the

[55:42] want on one hand was barabus a thief a
[55:46] murderer a liar evil in his flesh he
[55:49] wasn't accused of this that's who he
[55:51] actually
[55:54] was
[55:56] he wasn't falsely accused he was guilty
[55:59] he knew he was
[56:01] guilty
[56:04] amen and on the other hand was Jesus the
[56:07] son of God the Holy One the Messiah am
[56:10] one who done nothing but evil and one

[56:37] blood but little did they know that's
[56:40] exactly what they
[56:43] needed they didn't realize

[57:00] now release the prisoner release the
[57:04] prisoner release barabus amen give us
[57:07] barabus and Jesus stood there oh I can
[57:11] see it in my mind Jesus stood there
[57:13] silently for he knew the will of the
[57:16] father he knew the father's will he said
[57:20] father let them have
[57:22] Barabas for Jesus knew

[57:35] there silent his father give them bar
[57:38] rabus because he
[57:41] knew right the father would have to
[57:44] treat Jesus like barabus so he could
[57:47] treat barabus like
[57:51] Jesus oh
[57:53] God
[57:55] he became me that I might become him by
[58:00] Grace you see Barabas thought it was the
[58:02] people that made him
[58:05] free he thought it was the will of the
[58:07] people that set him free and let me say

[1:10:17] myself you done for me what no other
[1:10:22] could do
[1:10:25] oh
[1:10:27] God maybe Satan's been lying to some of
[1:10:29] these young people maybe they've been
[1:10:32] coming to this church just sitting on
[1:10:34] the Pew they feel like they don't fit in
[1:10:36] they don't
[1:10:37] belong because Satan has told them it's
[1:10:40] not for you you're not one of
[1:10:43] them or maybe they've looked at some of
[1:10:45] the lies that's been posted on the
[1:10:47] internet and it's confused their
[1:10:50] minds Satan trying to lock them up in a
[1:10:54] prison House of
[1:10:57] confusion or whatever it would be Lord
[1:11:00] we spoke of many different things but
[1:11:02] maybe something here that someone's
[1:11:04] dealing with that wasn't spoke but Lord
[1:11:06] may they realize even though it wasn't
[1:11:08] spoke they can still go free from that
[1:11:11] Lord For Whom the son is made free is
[1:11:15] free
[1:11:17] indeed oh Father may we realize May each
[1:11:21] of us realize Lord
[1:11:25] barabus it's me amen son of the
[1:11:31] father and oh God I pray this
[1:11:36] afternoon if there be one Lord who could
[1:11:38] step out
[1:11:41] free and these meetings have not been in
[1:11:43] vain
[1:11:45] Lord God you see the needs of your
[1:11:47] people the congregation decides Lord no
[1:11:50] doubt there's many needs some sick Lord
[1:11:52] some battling different things cancers
[1:11:54] Lord whatever it would be I I I don't
[1:11:56] know Lord but you know every person here
[1:12:01] and I pray in the name of Jesus by the
[1:12:03] same anoing that raised my Lord from the
[1:12:05] grave may it move upon each heart and
[1:12:09] upon each home
[1:12:11] Lord granted this afternoon I pray
[1:12:13] father
[1:12:14] God in Jesus name whatever heads bowed
[1:12:18] just a moment not to point you out
[1:12:20] friend I would never do that but if
[1:12:22] you're here
[1:12:24] and you believe that God sent this
[1:12:25] message for you and maybe you're dealing
[1:12:27] with things your parents don't even know
[1:12:29] your brothers and sisters don't know
[1:12:30] your husband your wife nobody knows but
[1:12:33] you but this message just spoke to you
[1:12:35] and you believe the

[1:12:39] Barabas done I I've I've looked at
[1:12:41] different places I've never really found
[1:12:43] out what baraba has done with this
[1:12:46] freedom but I want to ask you this
[1:12:48] afternoon what are you going to do with
[1:12:50] your
[1:12:51] freedom that's already been given to you

[1:24:45] praise God that's who he was preaching
[1:24:47] about he wasn't preaching about himself
[1:24:49] he was preaching about God I was
[1:24:51] thinking while was
[1:24:53] ministering you know I read you that
[1:24:55] quote not too long ago where brother R
[1:24:57] said sister Alicia was talking about
[1:24:59] holding yourself that's why that's why
[1:25:02] your virginity that's why you're that's
[1:25:04] why it's so important because you take
[1:25:06] it over to the spiritual part and and
[1:25:11] listen but there comes one time remember
[1:25:13] I read the quote brother R said you've
[1:25:15] held yourself all your
[1:25:18] life all your life you've held yourself
[1:25:21] you fought off them Devils called boys
[1:25:23] you fought off all the things to stay
[1:25:26] pure but there's one day you got to give
[1:25:28] up what you've been saving all your life
[1:25:32] when you give it all to your
[1:25:34] husband what a special thing so now
[1:25:38] let's take it over to the spiritual part
[1:25:40] we've had demons beat on us we've had
[1:25:42] Devils all over us and we've tried our
[1:25:45] best to stay the Virgin bride of Jesus
[1:25:47] Christ but one day folks we got to give
[1:25:49] it we got to surrender everything we are
[1:25:52] to our husband he'll never do us wrong
[1:25:55] he'll never divorce US amen we're the
[1:25:59] bride we're the
[1:26:01] reason that he came
[1:26:04] back on the day of Pentecost was to get
[1:26:06] a bride
[1:26:07] ready but have we surrendered all have
[1:26:11] we went ahead and said Okay God you're
[1:26:14] my husband I'm giving you everything I
[1:26:18] got everything I got that's why the song
[1:26:22] I surrender all that's good but if
[1:26:25] you're not raising your hand you ain't
[1:26:27] surrendering that's universal sign of
[1:26:30] surrender Universal all over the world
[1:26:33] when you throw both hands up like this
[1:26:35] you've
[1:26:37] surrendered now what I tell you if you
[1:26:39] put one hand behind your back and you
[1:26:41] surrender like this no you might get
[1:26:45] shot cuz you can use this hand to get
[1:26:48] whatever gun knife whatever but when you
[1:26:50] got both hands up in the air
[1:26:53] there's nothing you can do amen so
[1:26:56] that's what we're going to do today
[1:26:58] we're going to give our
[1:26:59] all like that sign says back there and
[1:27:02] that brother Daryl preached that sermon
[1:27:03] years
[1:27:05] ago about giving our All to Jesus Christ
[1:27:07] and that's s on that door back there as
[1:27:09] you walk in he's talking about the
[1:27:11] football team you know saying that we
[1:27:13] give today we give all the Tennessee
[1:27:15] football he had been down there and
[1:27:17] looked in the stadium and they hit it
[1:27:18] they hit the uh door every time they go
[1:27:21] out
[1:27:22] have you give your all today if they can
[1:27:25] do it out in the world and act crazy
[1:27:28] jump up and down shout and scream for
[1:27:30] their favorite team I think we ought to
[1:27:31] do the same thing for our favorite team
[1:27:34] amen team Jesus amen team Jesus will
[1:27:37] never he'll never
[1:27:40] lose yeah you ain't got to look for the
[1:27:42] score it's already done he won at
[1:27:45] Calvary but thank God there was a
[1:27:50] barabus that's right cuz it proved
[1:27:52] proved who Jesus was right it proved who
[1:27:55] Jesus was it proved that somebody had to
[1:27:57] take my
[1:27:59] place so that I could go
[1:28:02] free Hey listen the crowd they hated
[1:28:06] Jesus they going to hate you they wanted
[1:28:09] barab us they wanted a thief and a liar

[1:28:11] world all you young people they love you
[1:28:13] out there why they love you out there
[1:28:14] because you just like them but when you
[1:28:17] make a stand for God when you surrender
[1:28:19] yourself to him you become real odd to
[1:28:22] the world because the the world will
[1:28:24] surrender their s to drugs alcohol all
[1:28:27] the different things of the world but if
[1:28:30] you surrender today you surrender all to

[2:00:25] the king amen I was I want to tell you a
[2:00:29] little something before we before we
[2:00:30] dismiss it was I was uh watching online
[2:00:34] somebody wasn't even a message preacher
[2:00:36] good
[2:00:39] grief brother Daryl's laughing laughing
[2:00:41] in there but you
[2:00:43] know I always wondered why the prodical
[2:00:45] son's
[2:00:47] father ran ran to
[2:00:50] him the Bible tells us when he sees when
[2:00:53] he sees the when he sees his
[2:00:56] son he runs to
[2:00:59] him you know why now that's not in the
[2:01:02] Bible but Jewish tradition tells us or
[2:01:06] told that person they had done some
[2:01:08] study the reason the father had to run
[2:01:11] to the gates of the city to get the sun
[2:01:13] before the sun entered into the into the
[2:01:17] city was that under Jewish tradition if
[2:01:20] you got an inheritance and you wasted it
[2:01:23] on
[2:01:25] Gentile righteous living you know he
[2:01:27] went out he he got rid of all his money
[2:01:30] and he bought and sold and got all kind
[2:01:32] of stuff and got in a bad way but you
[2:01:34] couldn't come back in the city that
[2:01:36] stone
[2:01:38] you so the
[2:01:41] Father the father knew that and before
[2:01:44] the devil the people of the cuz see if
[2:01:47] he to let that guy walk on in he let his
[2:01:49] son walk on him doesn't matter son or
[2:01:50] not they could have stoned him they
[2:01:53] could have killed him but he went out
[2:01:54] remember put the cat around him he said
[2:01:57] welcome home in other words I'm going to
[2:01:59] take your shame and I'm going to bring
[2:02:01] you back into where you're supposed to
[2:02:02] be well praise God if that didn't if
[2:02:04] that didn't help you it sure helped me
[2:02:07] amen I always wondered why he ran out
[2:02:09] sure you know you're happy and but why
[2:02:11] couldn't the guy you know the son come
[2:02:13] no he had to go get him right he had to
