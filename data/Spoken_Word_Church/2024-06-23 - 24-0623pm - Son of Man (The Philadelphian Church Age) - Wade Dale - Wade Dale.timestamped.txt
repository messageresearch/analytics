[13:16] you've give
[13:17] us Lord give us today our daily bread
[13:20] we've come to hear from you Lord not
[13:22] from an individual but from you
[13:24] Lord that you'll give us Lord Of Your
[13:28] Grace
[13:29] the word of God may it come forth and
[13:31] not return void but accomplish what it
[13:34] said it would accomplish father this
[13:37] word that we have is quickening power
[13:40] it's something that the devil can't
[13:41] stand he hates the word of God and
[13:44] father I pray that that we'll shout it
[13:47] from the
[13:47] Housetop that the word of God is true
[13:51] the word of God is pure and the word of
[13:53] God is inside each and every one of us
[13:55] by the baptism of the Holy Ghost father
[13:57] I pray that you be with us now in the
[13:59] for them of this service be with the
[14:00] ones that are sick be with the ones Lord
[14:02] on Foreign Fields we ask you to give us
[14:04] a blessing today that we can't contain
[14:06] in Jesus name we pray amen now we're on
[14:09] our study with in the seven Church ages
[14:11] and and we're in the we've been in the
[14:14] sardian church age just for a little bit
[14:16] now we're into the Philadelphia Church
[14:19] age if we can get to it because um
[14:22] brother Donnie um f Bush and I were
[14:24] talking the other day and it's you try
[14:26] to get through something and then
[14:27] something else pops up you try to get
[14:29] through that and then something else
[14:30] pops up and I want to get more about I
[14:33] will restore today because the
[14:36] restoration started in Martin Luther's
[14:39] Ministry now remember it was Reformation
[14:42] but it was also the beginning of
[14:44] restoration because it was the two
[14:45] shoots that come up out of the ground
[14:47] After the Dark Ages was over so let's
[14:49] read Revelations 1:10 I was in the
[14:51] spirit on the Lord's day and I heard
[14:53] behind me a great voice as of a trumpet
[14:55] saying I am Alpha and Omega the first
[14:57] and the last what thou seest right in a
[15:00] book and send it to the seven churches
[15:02] of Ephesus Smyrna pergamus thyra Sardis
[15:05] in Philadelphia and Leota and I turned
[15:08] to see The Voice being turned I saw
[15:10] seven golden
[15:12] candlesticks and there was a strange
[15:14] thing behind those candlesticks there
[15:15] was a man standing
[15:17] there but that man had on symbol symbols
[15:21] that were feminis right and in the midst
[15:24] of the seven candlesticks one likened to
[15:26] the son of man which was a man clothed
[15:29] with a garment down to the foot and Girt
[15:31] about the paps which is up here breast
[15:34] feminis with a golden girdle so there
[15:37] was the son of man there was Jesus
[15:40] Christ standing in Bride form in these
[15:42] Church ages that we're talking about
[15:44] it's God in us it's not God uh you know
[15:48] we're not going to see the Lord Jesus
[15:49] until we meet him in the air but we're
[15:51] going to see him through you through
[15:52] through each individual person the Bride
[15:54] of Jesus Christ so now let's read what
[15:57] the Philadelphian Church a Revelations
[16:00] 3:7 to the angel of the church in
[16:03] Philadelphia we're coming down the home
[16:05] stretch here these things sayith he
[16:07] that's holy he that's true he that hath
[16:10] the Key of David he that openeth and no
[16:12] man shutteth and shutteth and no man
[16:14] openeth I Know Thy words Behold I have
[16:17] set before thee an open door and no one
[16:20] can shut it for thou Hast a little
[16:22] strength and has kept my word and H has
[16:24] not denied my name behold I will make
[16:28] the them of the synagogue of Satan which
[16:31] say they are Jews and are not but do lie
[16:34] behold I will make them to come in
[16:35] worship before thy feet and to know that
[16:38] I have loved them because thou Hast kept
[16:41] the word of my patience I also will keep
[16:43] thee from the hour of Temptation thank
[16:45] God for that which shall come upon all
[16:49] the
[16:50] world all the world to try them that
[16:53] dwell upon the Earth behold I come
[16:55] quickly hold that fast which thou Hast
[16:58] that no man take thy Crown to him that
[17:01] overcometh will I make a pillar in the
[17:03] temple of my God and he shall go no more
[17:05] out and I will write upon him the name
[17:07] of my God and the name of the city of my
[17:09] God which is New Jerusalem which cometh
[17:12] down out of Heaven from my God and I
[17:14] will write upon him my new name he that
[17:18] hath an ear let him hear what the spirit
[17:20] saith unto the churches you may be
[17:22] seated in the Lord I His blessings to
[17:24] the reading of the
[17:25] word now we've kind of got the we've got
[17:28] the graph here I want you
[17:29] to to
[17:32] um kind of hold that a picture in your
[17:34] mind because we're going to look at at
[17:37] God restoring the church
[17:39] back and we're going to see this is this
[17:42] thing is going to be split up because
[17:43] remember God's perfected in what threes
[17:46] all right but now remember the number of
[17:48] man is four and the number of
[17:51] restoration is four God's perfect number
[17:54] is three right but you've got four
[17:57] combat beasts you've got uh four bugs
[18:00] you've got four horse riders so that's
[18:02] an Earthly number which is not
[18:05] bad because that's a number of
[18:07] restoration but we're going to start
[18:08] here and we're going to look at the
[18:10] first three Church ages we're going to
[18:12] split it up and have the one in the
[18:13] middle and then the last three Church
[18:15] ages being the ones that is closest to
[18:18] us but it will be the ones that will
[18:21] complete the birth back to the word of
[18:23] God everybody with me we're going to
[18:25] look at it in just a minute I will
[18:27] restore when he restored me when to
[18:29] restore something means it had to fall
[18:32] to restore it back it had to fall and
[18:34] Jesus said unless a corn of wheat fall
[18:35] on the ground and die it B us
[18:37] alone but if it comes back up in other
[18:40] words it'll bring forth more fruit now
[18:42] look they had the pure word of God in
[18:44] these three Church
[18:45] ages there wasn't any denomination sure
[18:47] there was some ideas and there was some
[18:49] things that were being formulated by
[18:51] Satan we know that by the white horse
[18:52] rider that was in those three ages but
[18:55] we also know that was a pure
[18:56] unadulterated word of God and there's a
[18:59] quote that that Dad used a long time ago
[19:01] and I can't find it cuz I can't get the
[19:02] right wording but maybe brother Joe or
[19:05] somebody can find it it's where brother
[19:07] R
[19:08] said that the first the word they had in
[19:11] these Church ages first three ages they
[19:13] should have took a
[19:14] Rapture but but but what kept it out was
[19:18] me and you standing here today but what
[19:20] kept it out was that the corn had to go
[19:22] back into the
[19:24] ground Jesus said unless a corner we go
[19:26] and die in the ground well you know he
[19:27] did that over here
[19:29] he died he went the ground come
[19:32] up all right but he was going to be eat
[19:35] down again CU I will restore what was
[19:38] eat what was eat the word of God was eat
[19:40] down here in this church age and then we
[19:42] see that the next three ages completes
[19:45] the birth that we realize in no as
[19:47] justification sanctification and the
[19:50] baptism of the Holy Ghost everybody with
[19:52] me all right so we're going to split
[19:54] that up into 3 one and three because God
[19:57] has perfected in threes but there's four
[19:59] there cuz four is restoration all right
[20:01] is everybody with me on that going to
[20:04] try to take a little little time on this
[20:06] one now remember all these Church ages a
[20:09] church is a woman we're not supposed to
[20:12] be dominant at all we're supposed to be
[20:16] submissive to Christ but once you assert
[20:19] yourself above God that's where Satan
[20:22] sits everybody with me all right that's
[20:24] what the devil says so so Satan wanted
[20:27] to be like God and and his only
[20:31] listen the only attribute God can
[20:33] portray is what he
[20:35] is cuz he can't
[20:39] change if he's love he's always been
[20:41] love if he's Perfection he's always
[20:43] going to be Perfection but Satan has to
[20:45] change CU he's not he's not uh he was
[20:49] perfect at one time but he's not Eternal
[20:51] he's not an eternal God like God is but
[20:54] he also he is a
[20:55] God right he wants to be like God so so
[20:58] he uses different tactics in different
[21:01] ways so what he done was he took the
[21:03] lowly female and he put her up above
[21:06] everything and made her dominant as we
[21:08] were talking about this morning under
[21:10] the Catholic church is they have Mar
[21:12] olry or mariology which is Mary up here
[21:15] and Jesus down here you pray to Mary
[21:17] don't pray to Jesus CU Mary's a lot
[21:19] better than Jesus is she's really kind
[21:21] and nice and he's
[21:23] not okay but anyway well that's what
[21:26] they live by but it's a dominating
[21:28] female everything happens in the church
[21:31] if some female now I'm not talking about
[21:33] a female person I'm talking about the
[21:34] church dominates over God God does away
[21:37] with them that's why he had to divorce
[21:39] Israel that's why that am man he had to
[21:42] put he had to put Israel away because
[21:44] they became a dominating Force theirself
[21:46] they went and got out from under the
[21:48] word of God and they did what God told
[21:50] them not to do and that was mixed with
[21:52] the world all right so they are a
[21:55] dominating force in these Church ages as
[21:58] we seeing those white horse riders with
[22:00] that power coming forth they were
[22:02] dominating the people okay and then you
[22:05] see in Revelation 17 the domination
[22:08] culminates into mystery Babylon the
[22:10] mother of harlots so you got harlots and
[22:13] the and the mother and the Abominations
[22:15] of the earth and I saw the woman drunk
[22:17] with the blood of the Saints with the
[22:19] blood of the martyrs of Jesus when I saw
[22:21] her I wondered with great admiration as
[22:24] I said this morning John admired that so
[22:26] much he was looking at it he was getting
[22:28] caught up in Hey listen you ought to
[22:31] every once in a while go to the YouTube
[22:32] and put in Vatican put in St Peter's
[22:35] Basilica look at some of those things
[22:38] that they do it's captivating it's
[22:40] beautiful it's perfect it's always gold
[22:42] it's always purple it's always the
[22:45] different things and it's always in line
[22:46] and it's always got the gold glittering
[22:49] and and it's a show but that's what John
[22:53] was admiring but remember that thing he
[22:55] was admiring was the thing that was
[22:57] killing the people
[22:59] all right so what about today what you
[23:01] looking for
[23:03] something for you to admire cuz this
[23:06] pretty and we got and we got a big
[23:09] church and we got a big pretty this and
[23:10] we got a big pretty that and we got it's
[23:12] good to have that but what do you
[23:14] looking for what are you looking for are
[23:16] you looking for that that something that
[23:20] you admire or something God
[23:23] admires God admires his bride that's
[23:26] right he loves her and he is AB
[23:29] absolutely he is captivated with his
[23:31] bride just as Lucas was with Lis you
[23:34] couldn't get I mean you could he could
[23:35] talk to him he's like brain was jelly
[23:37] that day I mean just he didn't know what
[23:39] he was doing he may still not know what
[23:41] he's doing after a year but praise the
[23:44] lord they're
[23:45] together but um we sure appreciate them
[23:48] coming today sure enough so now let's
[23:51] look at the opening of the first now
[23:52] we're going to look at the first three
[23:54] seals and remember the seals looses a
[23:56] Ministry once once
[23:58] the lamb opened the seal there was
[24:00] something went out like a white horse
[24:02] rider which was there was four of them
[24:04] but we're up to number three now but
[24:07] there was a Ministry loosed and that
[24:09] Ministry was so captivating as we were
[24:11] looking at John it was so admired that
[24:14] it was a white horse and he had a bow
[24:16] and he had a crown and oh it looked
[24:19] pretty and and most people thought well
[24:21] that's the church and even brother
[24:22] Brandon preached the mighty conqueror he
[24:24] preached that that was the Holy
[24:25] Ghost don't get quiet on me now 1959
[24:29] Mighty conquer read it he read
[24:31] Revelation 6 there were several Mighty
[24:33] conquer I don't know which one it was
[24:35] but he showed that this was must and and
[24:38] his his I guess his um understanding at
[24:41] the time was well there's a white horse
[24:44] and and you know this looks really nice
[24:46] and really pretty and they're going
[24:47] forth conquering and and all that but we
[24:49] know that it once the seal opened that
[24:51] it was the
[24:52] devil all right and I saw when the lamb
[24:54] open one of the seals I heard his were
[24:56] the noise of Thunder one of the four
[24:57] beasts which is the lion that was the
[24:59] first three Church ages get that in your
[25:01] mind we're going to get a chart maybe
[25:03] somewhere and put it up should have done
[25:05] it before we started but your first
[25:07] Three Ages was the boldness of the lion
[25:10] they had the word of God they had it
[25:11] without uh without principle there was
[25:14] nothing going on there wasn't a Baptist
[25:16] Church on every corner Methodist Church
[25:17] on every corner or there wasn't even a
[25:19] Roman Catholic Church at the time if
[25:22] you'll read in your history go to your
[25:24] history right before nah there was not
[25:27] many Church churches besides True
[25:31] Churches read your read it if you've
[25:34] read it before you'll know they had they
[25:36] had the truth on every corner they had
[25:39] the truth in the churches during the
[25:41] first three Church ages and then Rome
[25:43] comes in and then she flips it around
[25:45] and then they suppress this group of
[25:48] people and they bring in their big
[25:50] churches and their big hierarchies and
[25:52] that's what we're see in
[25:53] today so the one of the four beasts
[25:55] which is the lion said come and see and
[25:57] I saw him Behold a white horse and he
[25:59] that sat on him had a boat and a crown
[26:01] was given unto him he went forth
[26:02] conquering and to conquer so the first
[26:04] three Church ages he bluffed his way
[26:07] into the true church Satan does not want
[26:10] to be in the false church he wants to be
[26:12] in the true church but when he comes
[26:14] into the true church brother Michael he
[26:16] makes it false cuz that's all he is
[26:18] there's no truth in him at all he's a
[26:21] liar even if he tries to tell a little
[26:23] bit of the truth like he did to Eve all
[26:25] but one word it was a lie
[26:28] all right but then it be become in these
[26:32] churches they become to say well I don't
[26:34] know well Mary is nicer than Jesus she
[26:36] was a sweet lady you know and and and
[26:39] and I don't see how Jesus was was God
[26:42] Almighty because he he cried and he had
[26:45] to eat and we saw him grown with a
[26:47] headache and we saw this and saw that so
[26:50] they said Well there must be he must be
[26:52] another substance of God so then they
[26:54] take another person out then they say
[26:56] well the Holy Ghost is the spirit so
[26:58] there's got to be another one so there's
[26:59] three Personalities in the godhead which
[27:02] was a saying then it began pre began to
[27:04] be preached it became a deed it became
[27:07] something that they wrote down and said
[27:08] this is what we believe then it became a
[27:10] Doctrine to where it came in the nasan
[27:12] council it was a doctrine that was it it
[27:15] was a trinity that was water baptism
[27:17] name father son Holy Ghost eternal hell
[27:20] Purgatory all those things were
[27:21] formulated now listen I said
[27:24] formulated Satan
[27:26] formulates remember he's not an original
[27:29] God had an original Church God's got an
[27:32] original word God's got an original
[27:34] Ministry but Satan follows right behind
[27:37] so close to the Bible says almost
[27:39] deceive the very elect if
[27:41] possible all
[27:44] right that's why every church has to
[27:46] have a Doctrine we have to have a do
[27:48] brother R said a church is not a church
[27:50] without a Doctrine right so you have to
[27:52] have a Doctrine well they have a
[27:53] Doctrine too their Doctrine is father
[27:55] son Holy Ghost baptism their Doctrine is
[27:57] Hell's Eternal their Doctrine is all we
[27:59] know all that we've been in the message
[28:01] long enough you heard it so those first
[28:03] three agents was they were the white
[28:05] righteous church but they began to
[28:08] eat from the Tree of knowledge of Good
[28:11] and Evil they didn't eat from the tree
[28:13] of life anymore they started going with
[28:15] man's ideas they started listening to
[28:18] other
[28:19] people so we get to the fourth Church
[28:21] age and when he had opened the second
[28:22] seal I heard the second beast which is
[28:24] the ox say come and see and there went
[28:26] out another horse that was red
[28:28] and power was given to him that sat
[28:30] there on to take peace from the earth
[28:32] and that they should kill one
[28:34] another and there was given unto him a
[28:37] great sword he had a bow and no arrows
[28:39] couldn't shoot anybody couldn't kill
[28:41] anybody but God allowed this power
[28:43] remember brother Dell preached many
[28:44] years ago a sermon called permitted
[28:46] power and that's what Satan has he has
[28:48] permitted power Satan can create no
[28:50] power of his self except you amen you
[28:56] give him the power you and me we give
[28:59] him we give Satan the power cuz he's
[29:01] powerless without having somebody to
[29:03] work through now God don't have nobody
[29:05] have to have anybody to work through he
[29:07] he decided that he wanted to work
[29:09] through a bride cuz he loved her and he
[29:11] loves us and we're part of it but
[29:13] Satan's not but Satan wants to have his
[29:16] own group so he tries to imitate so he
[29:19] gets on a red horse and he rides that
[29:21] red horse through that middle Church age
[29:22] the fourth Church Age killing people
[29:25] killing 68 million Christians because
[29:28] they believe something different than
[29:30] what the Catholic Church
[29:32] believe and he was given a great sword
[29:34] or a word so he went forth and he was
[29:37] conquering but now he's going to
[29:39] kill brother said they took the sword of
[29:42] dogma and Antichrist and cut down the
[29:44] real true worshippers all down Through
[29:46] the Ages by the millions and when Christ
[29:48] comes with a sword for it's his word
[29:50] that proceeds out of his mouth he will
[29:52] slay every enemy there is before him you
[29:55] believe it kill the enemy
[29:58] Revelation
[30:00] 6:5 now we'll get to the church age we
[30:02] just talked about the sardian church age
[30:05] and the Philadelphian Church age is the
[30:07] man anointing or the man beast power all
[30:12] right because remember a man is what a
[30:15] man is
[30:17] intelligent a lon's bold a lon's
[30:20] strong but it's not as intelligent as a
[30:22] man is an ox is not as intelligent as a
[30:26] man is so we come to the intelligent age
[30:28] and I read you a whole list of things I
[30:30] don't even think I brought it but there
[30:31] was a whole list from the 1500s to the
[30:34] 1800s which covered these two Church
[30:37] ages Ma you had all kind of things you I
[30:39] mean you had you had buggies coming up
[30:41] you had gunpowder you had uh print
[30:44] presses you had all these different
[30:45] things that were that were formulated by
[30:47] man and put together it was a it was an
[30:50] age and then brother randam will tell us
[30:51] about the next Church age Philadelphia
[30:53] that where that open door was a
[30:55] missionary age they could travel faster
[30:57] they could travel better they could get
[30:58] in a boat they didn't have a car at the
[31:00] time but they could get in some really
[31:02] fast two Hors wagons instead of one
[31:04] horse wagon so as man Advanced we know
[31:07] Satan
[31:09] advanced cuz he's the tree of knowledge
[31:11] of Good and Evil so when he had opened
[31:13] the third seal I heard the third Beast
[31:14] the Manpower say come and see and I
[31:17] beheld a low of Black Horse He that said
[31:19] on him had a pair of balances in his
[31:21] hand I was thinking about this yesterday
[31:22] brother Bown doesn't cover this but if
[31:25] he's symbolizing now listen to me just a
[31:27] second if he's before you go to sleep if
[31:29] he's
[31:31] symbolizing if John sees
[31:34] this now remember in the first two
[31:37] Church ages it was symbolics and it was
[31:40] hidden it was it was a mystery it was a
[31:43] bow with no arrows it was given a great
[31:45] sword we didn't know what that was until
[31:47] the seal opened brother M told us that
[31:49] sword was a false doctrine that bow was
[31:51] a bluff now we come to this person here
[31:54] which is he's now got a pair of balances
[31:56] in his hand now what is the pair of
[31:58] balance is you put something on here
[32:01] which is a known weight one pound weight
[32:03] and then you keep putting stuff on here
[32:05] until they what balance
[32:07] out to
[32:09] me now like I said this is just me that
[32:11] I the way I see it if there's symbolics
[32:14] there then we see that the third Beast
[32:16] or the sardian church age everything
[32:19] started to come back into
[32:21] balance the truth started to come back
[32:24] into balance cuz it was so much false to
[32:27] Luther we're going to see in a minute
[32:28] when Le when Luther pulled out man they
[32:30] hated him they tried to kill him right
[32:33] why he was trying to bring the balance
[32:35] back he was trying to bring the balance
[32:37] back but he couldn't bring it all the
[32:38] way back cuz he was a reformer not a
[32:41] restorer he wasn't a prophet he was a
[32:44] minister he was a anointed of God had
[32:47] the baptism of the Holy Ghost just like
[32:49] you do but he was only anointed to give
[32:51] a certain piece of the word which was
[32:53] the just shall live by faith but as
[32:56] Satan saw a man sit with balances in his
[32:58] hand I believe God was balancing the
[33:00] word back out again he was bringing it
[33:03] back to light to where we can understand
[33:05] what true justification is that we don't
[33:07] have to do Penance that we don't have to
[33:08] do works we just saved by
[33:11] grace Justified freely as we read the
[33:14] scriptures that we did this morning and
[33:17] it was a black horse and what's black
[33:20] horse a black horse is
[33:23] death and I Heard a Voice in the midst
[33:26] of the four Beast now look the there was
[33:28] another voice came
[33:30] out this was Jesus Christ
[33:33] himself another voice a voice in the
[33:36] midst of the four Beast said a measure
[33:38] of wheat for a penny and three measures
[33:40] of barley for a penny see thou hurt not
[33:42] the oil and the wine he knew they were
[33:44] going to charge for no venance he knew
[33:46] that they were going to charge for all
[33:47] these indulgences and praying people out
[33:50] of purgatory and all these different
[33:51] things but he says hey don't hurt my oil
[33:55] and my wine in other words leave the
[33:57] Holy Ghost alone the Holy Ghost is going
[34:00] to work in these Church ages Satan you
[34:03] leave it alone cuz you can't touch it
[34:06] anyway so listen on the third seal
[34:09] brother Ram says look how many knows
[34:11] what the third Beast look like look like
[34:13] a man the first one was a lion the other
[34:15] one a calf or an ox and the third one
[34:17] look like a man or as a
[34:20] man now remember the first church age
[34:23] was a lion age that was a line of the
[34:25] tribe of Judah Christ his own influence
[34:27] of Life taken that age that's the first
[34:30] Beast which means power that answered by
[34:33] human voice the next age was the ox age
[34:36] or the Dark Age the dark Rider's age now
[34:39] the reason this first age was a white
[34:40] age I've always heard people say that
[34:42] the first Rider white was the power of
[34:44] the church see he said the same thing
[34:47] went forth to conquer him we find out he
[34:48] was given a crown that that was it it
[34:51] was the church it was the church but
[34:54] where did he go to he went to
[34:56] Rome that Church went to Rome it came
[34:58] out of that's where it started was in
[35:00] Rome it's where he did or received his
[35:03] crown now remember the second age was a
[35:06] red horse which was a dark age and now
[35:09] the next age the man age which was the
[35:11] black horse rider he was the age of the
[35:14] reformers the Voice who spoke now the
[35:17] black horse rider that was the
[35:18] Antichrist but the one that was speaking
[35:21] in that age was represented as a man and
[35:25] that's the wisdom smart rudness cuz
[35:28] listen Martin Luther had to be shrewd
[35:32] John Wesley had to be shrewd cuz the
[35:34] Catholic church was the dominant force
[35:35] in that age and if they said the wrong
[35:37] thing we know they did but they used
[35:40] their smartness to get like Luther he
[35:42] said what he said and he run into that
[35:44] castle and hit for two three years he
[35:46] wasn't a coward he just needed to get
[35:49] alone to write the Bible and put it
[35:51] together all right so now what brother R
[35:54] say here we let's just put it all
[35:55] together Antichrist why White Horse
[35:58] kills by spirit being Antichrist
[36:01] spiritual killed now that happened in
[36:03] the first church age it was a bluff so
[36:04] he spiritually killed the people not red
[36:06] watch number two red horse kills by
[36:09] sword or word but they kill by literal
[36:12] sword political power when church and
[36:14] state United black horse Souls when he
[36:17] give out his Doctrine and she did there
[36:20] with her fornications and he weighed out
[36:22] the food by sold there what he give food
[36:24] for balance and Penny and so forth in
[36:26] other words indulgences and then we'll
[36:27] get into the fourth Church age I mean
[36:29] the fourth uh seal which will be the
[36:31] last Church age is this church age we
[36:34] live in now it's a Pale
[36:37] Horse what Jesus tell us he said in
[36:40] Revelations 3:14 he said I wished you
[36:42] were cold or
[36:44] hot I wish you were black or
[36:47] white not color of
[36:49] people but I wish you were black or
[36:51] white but what have we done we mixed it
[36:55] he s I'm going to spew you out of my
[36:56] mouth that's the Pale Horse Pale Horse
[36:59] was all three of those wound up together
[37:01] into one color Eternal separation from
[37:04] God oh my praise be to God now just for
[37:08] a minute we'll look at the sardian
[37:09] church age I know th Works remember it
[37:11] was works because it was the O's age now
[37:13] that's the name that you liveth in are
[37:15] dead and I've not found your works
[37:17] perfect before God why because a lot of
[37:20] it still was Catholic dogma but Luther
[37:23] wasn't responsible to bring everything
[37:26] all the way out he was only responsible
[37:28] to preach the just yall live by faith
[37:30] and tell the people you have an option
[37:32] past the Catholic Church you have a way
[37:35] to get out of that where you don't have
[37:37] to pay penants anymore believe the word
[37:39] of God like I said before Luther took
[37:42] the Latin Vulgate turned it into German
[37:44] and from German tendale turned it into
[37:46] English so that give you our that give
[37:48] our Bible here that we see
[37:50] today as Luther crystallized the
[37:52] doctrine of justification by faith they
[37:54] held to Works Penance prayers and other
[37:56] unscriptural means and as for the freed
[37:59] Christians glorified the son the
[38:01] Catholic Church increased their
[38:03] deification of Mary even until the 20th
[38:05] century like now where Pope Pi literally
[38:08] exalted married to glorification in a
[38:10] resurrected body how many of y'all knew
[38:11] that before I told you
[38:13] that I know some of you didn't yeah they
[38:18] literally preach teach that Mary was
[38:22] resurrected with
[38:23] Jesus now I don't know how
[38:29] and she sits on the white on the throne
[38:31] you know she she's been glorified and
[38:33] she's she's been taken
[38:35] up and a resurrected
[38:38] body that Doctrine is absolutely the
[38:40] Babylonian one that remember we talked
[38:42] about doas and and sael in this sardian
[38:45] church age where that
[38:47] happened the son carried the mother up
[38:50] to heaven it just it's just false Pagan
[38:53] they come right from the Pagan pages of
[38:54] the pagan bible
[38:59] so Martin Luther had to stand against
[39:01] that he's regarded as one of the most
[39:03] influential figures in Western and
[39:04] Christian history why he finally stood
[39:07] up to the Catholic church he finally
[39:09] stood up and said that's enough we're
[39:12] not paying anymore indulges we're not
[39:14] doing that we're going to live by the
[39:16] word of God and God was happy with that
[39:19] even though he just preached a just
[39:20] shall live by faith and he may have
[39:22] believed in a trinity he may have
[39:23] baptized in Father Son and Holy Ghost
[39:25] but that wasn't time that was a reformer
[39:27] time that was not a restoration time
[39:30] praise God we've got the restoration
[39:31] time in our time yes but it took a
[39:34] prophet to
[39:36] restore the Bible tells us and this is
[39:39] what I was telling you this morning when
[39:40] we
[39:40] ended Martin Luther was sitting one day
[39:43] and he was pinning the Bible from Latin
[39:45] to to um German and he read Romans 1 and
[39:49] he got happy he said for therein is the
[39:52] righteousness of God revealed from Faith
[39:54] to Faith as as it is written that just
[39:57] shall live by faith and I believe that
[39:59] that that brother Chris that that just
[40:01] illuminated in his in his head those
[40:03] those words just popped up off the page
[40:05] ay no tell how many times he read it cuz
[40:07] he had to wrote it in the Old Testament
[40:09] CU it's in the Old Testament everybody
[40:11] with me you know that it's in the Old
[40:14] Testament because that's why Paul said
[40:17] as it is
[40:18] written he knew it was in the Old
[40:20] Testament and he just brought it up
[40:22] today for the wrath of God is revealed
[40:24] from Heaven against all ungodliness and
[40:26] unrighteousness of men who hold the
[40:29] truth the Catholic Church they held the
[40:32] truth but they held an unrighteousness
[40:35] they added their part to it before they
[40:37] give it out to the
[40:38] people Luther read in Galatians 3 this
[40:41] is Paul still writing but that no man is
[40:43] justified by the law in the sight of God
[40:46] it is evident for the just shall live by
[40:49] faith Hebrews 10:38 says now the just
[40:53] shall live by faith but if any man draw
[40:55] back my soul shall have no pleasure in
[40:57] him in other words if anybody has
[40:58] another
[41:00] Doctrine I'm not going to be
[41:03] there my soul the soul of God shall have
[41:07] no pleasure in him but we are not of
[41:09] them who draw back into predition but of
[41:12] them that believe to the saving of the
[41:13] soul and I believe Martin Luther had a
[41:15] little bit of a Pentecostal experience
[41:17] at that time he said man he said this is
[41:20] the way it is because that's when he
[41:21] wrote his thesis that's when he wrote
[41:23] the 95 thesis and he pulled away from
[41:25] the Catholic church and remember he
[41:27] wrote that letter to the pope pretty
[41:29] much he blistered the
[41:31] pope told him he wasn't the one that we
[41:34] needed to pray to he wasn't the one we
[41:36] needed to pay indulgences to it said
[41:38] just shall live by the faith of God and
[41:40] they Redeemed by Jesus Christ according
[41:42] to
[41:46] Isaiah but he went
[41:49] against modern
[41:51] theology but he were a reformer he was a
[41:54] mighty preacher and teacher of the word
[41:56] and his insisted especially in his first
[41:58] years of public Eminence that the word
[42:01] was the sole
[42:02] Criterion thus he was against works as a
[42:04] means of Salvation and baptism as a
[42:07] means of
[42:08] regeneration because at that time the
[42:10] Catholic Church developed the sprinkling
[42:12] of the kids and the babies and do you
[42:15] know the Catholic church that's a
[42:16] Doctrine if your baby is not
[42:19] christened it goes to
[42:22] hell Josh went through one well they had
[42:25] one it's some some of Leah
[42:27] folks yeah they they put a lot in they
[42:30] they try to get it there before the baby
[42:31] dies if the baby dies the baby goes to
[42:33] hell so they try to get it to the
[42:35] christening part so I'm sure the
[42:36] christening part had a little bit under
[42:38] the table maybe some green backs was
[42:40] from 50s or hundreds in in a in a roll
[42:43] somewhere but that's what they said you
[42:45] got to be you got to have that baby
[42:47] infant baptism no such thing as that
[42:50] thank God for a prophet brother R said
[42:52] all babies go to heaven good enough for
[42:55] me all right now when you come to the
[42:57] age of accountability you need to be
[42:58] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[43:00] Christ but as a baby all babies go to
[43:03] heaven praise the Lord for a prophet see
[43:06] the pro that's the difference between a
[43:07] prophet and a reformer a prophet brings
[43:10] the word of God and lines it right up a
[43:11] reformer can bring a little bit out but
[43:13] there's still some down here that's not
[43:16] correct thank God he sent us a prophet
[43:18] that's why he said he would send us one
[43:19] in the end time to restore us back to
[43:21] what that first church age where Paul
[43:24] was thus he was against the works of is
[43:27] a mean of Sal means of Salvation and
[43:29] baptism as a means of regeneration he
[43:32] taught the mediation of Christ apart
[43:33] from man which the mediation of the pope
[43:36] is I mean of Catholic is what the pope
[43:39] you go to the pope or you pray to
[43:41] Mary he taught the mediation of Christ
[43:44] apart from man as was the original and
[43:46] Pentecostal concept what stirred his
[43:48] heart by the Holy Ghost which was the
[43:50] little green chute that signified that
[43:53] truth was coming back not that it was
[43:56] 100% truth
[43:57] but the seed had to go under the ground
[43:59] we'll show it to you in just a minute
[44:01] but it didn't come back as full grain
[44:03] you don't plant corn and all of a sudden
[44:05] you get a an ear of corn sticks up out
[44:07] of the
[44:08] ground sometimes I wish that you take
[44:10] care of all the times of drought and all
[44:12] the other times of worms and everything
[44:14] else getting in it but it came with two
[44:16] shoots then after the two shoots come a
[44:18] stalk after the stalk come a tassel
[44:20] after the tassel come to corn and that's
[44:22] the age we're in now but it had to start
[44:23] with two
[44:24] shoes that signified that truth was
[44:27] coming back to the church in other words
[44:29] like I said God was balancing it back up
[44:32] where it got so unbalanced in the in the
[44:34] Dark Ages now he's balancing it back up
[44:37] but now remember Satan's right there
[44:39] with
[44:43] him truth was coming back to the church
[44:46] as it was known at Pentecost was the
[44:48] doctrine of justification which is what
[44:52] salvation by grace apart from Works
[44:55] justification there is Absol absolutely
[44:57] no way you can get it by working that's
[44:59] right you work after you get it but not
[45:04] before I recognize that Dr Luther did
[45:06] not believe only and preach only
[45:08] justification but that was his major
[45:10] theme as indeed it had to be for that is
[45:13] the basic doctrine of the truth of the
[45:15] word you know that that is if you if you
[45:18] never get
[45:20] Justified you won't get the Holy
[45:23] Ghost what you quiet for
[45:28] you can't just jump right up to get the
[45:30] Holy Ghost sorry you know the teaching
[45:32] of this church and brother Brown too you
[45:33] got to go through three stages you got
[45:34] to be justified you got to ask God to
[45:36] chop off your past sins before he's
[45:38] going to try to come into your sorry
[45:40] self amen then he's got to clean you up
[45:43] take an unclean Spirit out so that you
[45:45] can what get along with
[45:47] you and him and then he fills you with
[45:49] the Holy Ghost he just don't just jump
[45:51] right in filling with the Holy GH fill
[45:52] you with the Holy Ghost I wish that was
[45:54] true no I don't then wouldn't be a
[45:58] journey now watch he will be forever
[46:01] known as the instrument in the hand of
[46:03] God who revived this truth see they had
[46:06] it in the first church age they knew
[46:07] they needed to be justified that's why
[46:10] Paul said Justified freely that's why
[46:12] Paul said to just your live by
[46:14] faith then you come up to James and he
[46:16] talk about works and faith we know how
[46:19] that works right it's not all
[46:22] works you show your works by the faith
[46:25] you have he was the fifth messenger and
[46:28] his message was the just shall live by
[46:30] faith surely we admit that he knew and
[46:34] did teach that we are to go from Faith
[46:35] to Faith In other words he did preach a
[46:37] progression he didn't just say the just
[46:38] shall live by faith and forget about it
[46:40] no he preached a progression but
[46:42] remember his progression didn't take to
[46:44] full restoration it only took partial to
[46:48] what reform the people all right see
[46:51] that's what they do when you take them
[46:52] to Alcoholics Anonymous and all these
[46:53] different things they try to reform them
[46:56] the old the the old Devil's still
[46:58] there right remember the alcoholic they
[47:01] go to the 12-step program they do all
[47:03] the AA stuff they said look you're
[47:04] always an alcoholic you can never be
[47:06] around alcohol you can never be around
[47:08] this why they're reforming you into
[47:11] something but I'm going to tell you
[47:12] something you received the baptism of
[47:14] the Holy Ghost in your soul and I
[47:16] promise you one thing you have been
[47:18] restored back to where you never drunk
[47:20] the thing in in the beginning and now
[47:23] what justification does it takes you
[47:25] back to where you never did it in the
[47:26] first place Place amen praise God surely
[47:31] we admit that he knew and did teach that
[47:32] we are to go from Faith to Faith His
[47:34] Marvelous understanding of sovereignty
[47:36] election predestination and other truths
[47:38] maybe he need to preach some people in
[47:40] the
[47:40] message show him to be a great man in
[47:43] the word yet I say again as do
[47:45] historians God used him to bring to the
[47:48] people God's standard against Works
[47:50] which is the just shall live by faith
[47:53] now as I mentioned already this age has
[47:54] been called by the historians the period
[47:57] of reformation that is exactly right
[47:59] that is what it is it had to be that for
[48:03] Martin Luther was a reformer not a
[48:05] prophet so he was not able to lead the
[48:08] church back to the whole truth as would
[48:12] a man like the Apostle Paul who was both
[48:15] Apostle and Prophet now what did Paul do
[48:17] Paul restored the
[48:20] law made it Grace and Faith by writing
[48:25] the New Testament hello
[48:27] then they live by that for the first
[48:29] three Church ages all right then so what
[48:31] Martin Luther did on this side of the
[48:33] Dark Ages he did the same thing he but
[48:35] he didn't bring a whole truth because he
[48:37] wasn't a prophet he couldn't catch the
[48:39] Revelation that Paul could catch he
[48:41] caught part of a revelation and that
[48:43] part was that just shall live by faith
[48:45] and the people came out there had to be
[48:47] that's why there is a Protestant
[48:50] movement are the Baptist the Baptists
[48:53] are Protestants the methodists are pro
[48:55] we're Protestants cuz we protest what
[48:58] happened back there we're
[49:00] Protestants all right so he was not able
[49:03] to lead the church back to the whole
[49:05] truth as would a man like the Apostle
[49:06] Paul who was both Apostle and
[49:12] Prophet brother R said the word does not
[49:14] call it a restoration but certainly
[49:16] calls it Reformation had it been a
[49:18] restoration that age would have been
[49:20] another Pentecostal age that's why your
[49:23] Alpha age was a what a Pentecostal age
[49:25] began with a Pentecostal age amen and
[49:28] your Omega Church is going to have to
[49:30] start with a 1906 isusa Street
[49:32] Pentecostal experience all right the
[49:35] word does not call it a restoration but
[49:36] certainly calls it Reformation had it
[49:38] been a restoration that age would have
[49:40] been under another Pentecostal age but
[49:43] it was not the best that could be said
[49:45] was strengthen that which remains that
[49:48] is ready to die there was something
[49:49] missing there was certainly there
[49:51] certainly was this age had justification
[49:54] but it missed same s
[49:57] ification all right now
[49:59] look and the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[50:02] that doesn't mean they didn't get the
[50:03] Holy Ghost that doesn't mean that God
[50:05] said no we're they're just no that's not
[50:08] what that brother R saying their
[50:11] justification was their holy
[50:14] ghost that was the Holy Ghost for the
[50:16] day and age they lived in Martin Luther
[50:19] will come up praise God with the other
[50:22] bride every bride down Through the Ages
[50:24] he'll come right up with them and we'll
[50:26] go into Glory but he didn't have the
[50:30] fullness that God wants to work in the
[50:32] fullness of the Holy Ghost but it did in
[50:35] this end time that is what God's
[50:37] original plan was watch that is what
[50:40] they had at Pentecost they were
[50:42] Justified they were Sanctified and
[50:44] filled with the Holy Ghost while listen
[50:46] to me the reason for being justified and
[50:48] Sanctified is to the end you might be
[50:51] baptized with the Holy Ghost amen that
[50:54] is the reason that there is a church
[50:56] it's the temple of God filled with God
[50:59] even the Holy Ghost The Same Spirit that
[51:01] was in Jesus while he was here on Earth
[51:03] causing him to do the mighty Works which
[51:04] he did came back upon the church at
[51:07] Pentecost so that they could do the
[51:09] works that he did this age did not have
[51:12] those
[51:13] works oh they had the written word but
[51:15] not the revealed word this just was the
[51:18] Reformation period but fear not little
[51:20] flock God said I will restore we'll talk
[51:22] about that in just a second and this
[51:24] reform was going to be the start of it
[51:25] he was going to according to his promise
[51:28] take the church back from the depths of
[51:30] Satan in the dark ages to the depths of
[51:32] God that they had at Pentecost and the
[51:35] first few years of the existence of the
[51:38] church now be careful and get this it
[51:40] says in the second verse it says for I
[51:42] have not found thy works perfect before
[51:44] God do you know what the meaning of not
[51:47] perfect really is it is
[51:50] unfulfilled this age was an unfulfilled
[51:53] age why they had to written word they
[51:56] had it already they they had already got
[51:58] it put in print form they had it in
[51:59] their hand but they didn't know how to
[52:01] use it they didn't know how to use it
[52:03] nobody was preaching at that time there
[52:05] was only one true and living God that
[52:07] there was only one water baptism in the
[52:09] name of Jesus Christ right so it was
[52:12] unfulfilled but it was an age CU I want
[52:14] you watch what brother R
[52:16] said it was just the start of getting
[52:18] back that is why I said the Bible called
[52:20] it Reformation not restoration it had
[52:23] started out in the doctrine of
[52:25] sanctification which meant salvation was
[52:28] all of God now see that pulled away from
[52:30] the Catholic church for 900 years they
[52:33] said believe the Catholic church and
[52:35] you're saved amen so God had to pull
[52:39] away from that but not he didn't pull
[52:41] away all the way he pulled them out so
[52:42] far watch I'll read this to you in just
[52:45] a
[52:45] second it started in the doctrine of
[52:47] justification which meant salvation was
[52:49] all of God oh how Luther preached the
[52:51] sovereignty of God in election he knew
[52:54] it was all of Grace he separated the
[52:56] church Church from rule by
[52:57] ecclesiastical hierarchy he tore down
[53:00] the idols he cast out the confession to
[53:02] the priest he denounced the pope he was
[53:05] a
[53:07] very important guy it was wonderfully
[53:11] good as he started but God said 1500
[53:13] years before Luther you are going to
[53:15] start things but your age will see it
[53:17] all
[53:19] unfulfilled I'm leaving that to what
[53:22] later hallelujah our god reth he knows
[53:25] the end from the beginning and yes
[53:26] Luther was his messenger it didn't look
[53:29] like it as We examined the flaws but
[53:31] there was a man called Jonah he had
[53:32] flaws in his life too but he was a
[53:34] prophet though you and I might not want
[53:36] to say it on the basis of how he acted
[53:39] now let's come on down a little further
[53:40] now this was an unfulfilled age now this
[53:43] is Brother Brown it was an age of
[53:45] reformation but that is how God wanted
[53:48] now
[53:49] remember no anybody ever told y'all God
[53:51] don't make a
[53:53] mistake like 15 times this morning and
[53:55] twice today
[53:57] God don't make a
[53:58] mistake I I sometimes we wonder what he
[54:01] never makes a mistake he's never had a
[54:03] different thought his thoughts the same
[54:05] that's why I can depend on what what and
[54:07] Luther could depend on that if God wrote
[54:10] it amen if God said to just shall live
[54:12] by faith he's not going to waver from
[54:14] that now man May waver but he's not
[54:16] going to waver for that from that and
[54:18] the just shall live by
[54:20] faith but that's how God wanted it
[54:25] Revelations 18:4 and I heard another
[54:27] voice from Heaven saying come out of her
[54:29] my people that you be not partaker of
[54:31] her sins and that you receive not of her
[54:33] plagues now remember he tells us to come
[54:35] out all right in this age we come fully
[54:38] out but in all the other ages only a
[54:40] partway come
[54:43] out don't get quiet I'm going to prove
[54:45] it right here brother R said in the
[54:48] Feast of the trumpets he said the Holy
[54:50] Ghost has been bound by the
[54:52] denominations all these 2,000 years
[54:55] right we find out it has now notice the
[54:57] sabbaths seven sabbaths they couldn't
[55:00] get all the way
[55:03] out all right so let's go back just a
[55:06] second and let's review the Sabbath what
[55:07] is the Sabbath it's every seven days
[55:09] there was a release or every seven every
[55:12] seven years there was a release right
[55:15] then you had a golden one which was the
[55:17] 50th Jubilee and everything went free
[55:20] but these these sevens every seven years
[55:23] only certain partial things I hope
[55:25] you're getting this only certain things
[55:27] went free that just shall live by faith
[55:30] that's what went free not everything
[55:32] else but when you come to the 50th
[55:34] Jubilee all goes free that's why seven
[55:38] sabbaths our brother Brown explains in
[55:40] this piece of the piece of the trumpet
[55:41] seven sevens is what 49 you're still in
[55:44] time you're still looped in the church
[55:46] ages that's why you and I have got to be
[55:49] called out of this age we've got to be
[55:52] in that Jubilee time where everything
[55:54] this thing right here yes ghost
[55:59] free you young people may not shout
[56:02] about that but that's people that are
[56:03] getting old absolutely we're shouting
[56:05] about it right brother Kylie Amen
[56:07] brother Kylie's in there holding his
[56:12] shoulder now Lucas said you know he's
[56:14] like man I can get out of the bed
[56:17] in .25 seconds larm goes off boom I'm up
[56:22] alarm goes off I hit
[56:24] snooze 3 4
[56:27] times and then there has to be a
[56:32] resurrection of my legs and my back and
[56:36] my arms you know how he say you look
[56:38] down you go feet get
[56:40] up well we're looking for that time
[56:43] where that don't have to happen we're
[56:44] going to be changed back to a young man
[56:46] and woman and we'll be that 20-year-old
[56:49] kid
[56:50] again ain't that great I mean y'all want
[56:53] to why would we want to do all we're
[56:55] doing come to the end of our life and
[56:58] then live in an old body for an
[57:01] eternity no we have a promise that we're
[57:04] going to be young
[57:05] kids Prime of our life 20 years
[57:10] old those of you that's not 20 yet you
[57:12] will be 20
[57:14] then lucky
[57:18] people so God promised a restoration
[57:21] let's talk about this just for a second
[57:22] and then you can go back to sleep I will
[57:24] restore
[57:27] God promised it and like I said before
[57:29] Jesus stood and said if a corn of wheat
[57:31] we'll read in just a minute fall on the
[57:33] ground and die to BU us alone but it's
[57:34] got to go in the ground so it can bring
[57:36] up more fruit if Jesus would have not
[57:38] went in the ground and died they
[57:39] wouldn't be fruit sitting here today
[57:41] they wouldn't be fruit in all the church
[57:43] ages but he had to die to release that
[57:46] life to release what was inside of him
[57:48] so that the plant could
[57:50] grow but he knew that in the middle
[57:53] Church age it was going to be eat again
[57:55] according to
[57:57] Joel I will restore the years that the
[58:01] palom worm cankerworm and all the
[58:02] different ones caterpillar has eaten
[58:04] we'll read it in a second I'm going to
[58:06] restore that that's why that that I love
[58:08] the book that brother Brown preached the
[58:10] restoration of the Bride tree it really
[58:11] brings out a lot of things that the
[58:12] Bible tells us that we can put it
[58:14] together and that's why he's a prophet
[58:17] see he was a prophet he could put those
[58:19] things together so perfect why because
[58:21] he had a mind of God it was actually God
[58:23] speaking to us in his fullness so the
[58:26] first three ages remember God's perfect
[58:28] in three the first three ages the pure
[58:31] word of God went out is everybody with
[58:33] me all right Shake Yourself just for a
[58:34] second you got the first three Church
[58:36] ages epsa Smyrna thara everybody I mean
[58:40] pergamus
[58:42] right then you got the Dark Ages the
[58:44] seed had to go in the ground in the Dark
[58:46] Ages 68 million Christians were killed
[58:49] but there had to be a little bit of
[58:50] light left there had to be enough to
[58:53] carry over so that something went they
[58:55] was planted it could come back up but
[58:57] when it comes back up you've got three
[58:59] more ages to complete the birth brother
[59:02] R's going to read it to we're going to
[59:03] read it in just a minute with Sardis
[59:05] which is the little Shute then you got
[59:07] Philadelphia the stock in between here
[59:10] in Lea was the what the
[59:12] shook which is Pentecost and then you
[59:15] got to full grain which is standing here
[59:17] today or sitting here today in front of
[59:19] me so the first three ages the pure word
[59:21] was preached then the fourth Church age
[59:23] went into the ground John 12:23 Jesus
[59:26] said the hour has come that the son of
[59:28] man should be glorified so so listen to
[59:31] get the glorification of the son of man
[59:33] or the are the fullness of the son of
[59:35] man he had to go in the
[59:37] ground then he had to go in the ground
[59:40] too in the middle of church age so that
[59:42] the son of man could come back right now
[59:44] today in the end time in his fullness
[59:47] verely verely I say unto you except the
[59:49] corn of wheat fall into the ground and
[59:51] die it abideth alone but if it die it
[59:55] bringeth forth much fruit and we see
[59:58] that today so now we see one two three
[1:00:01] middle age Columba that age right th
[1:00:04] tyan age the word went in the ground
[1:00:06] they eat it down so bad Till There Was
[1:00:08] Not much any of it left but then God
[1:00:10] said I will restore and he starts with
[1:00:12] two shoes Martin Luther the just shall
[1:00:14] live by faith John Wesley sanctification
[1:00:17] then the baptism of the Holy Ghost you
[1:00:19] see it there and then brother Brian
[1:00:20] brings this message at the end of the
[1:00:22] Pentecostal
[1:00:23] age everybody with me on that
[1:00:26] all right Joel 2 says behold be glad ye
[1:00:30] children of Zion and rejoice now who are
[1:00:32] we we're the children we're the
[1:00:33] daughters of Zion right and rejoice in
[1:00:35] the Lord your God for Heath given you
[1:00:37] the former Reign moderately now what's
[1:00:39] the former reain that's teaching the
[1:00:41] former rain is a teaching rain all right
[1:00:44] if rainfalls what do you do you
[1:00:47] plant you hope and pray that it rains on
[1:00:50] it to pop that seed open all right is
[1:00:53] everybody with me then you got a rain
[1:00:56] right before the Harvest you need
[1:00:57] another rain to really boost it up and
[1:01:00] then it's going to dry out and become
[1:01:02] grain again just like it was what you
[1:01:04] put in the ground some of you people
[1:01:05] that have Gardens you know what I'm
[1:01:07] talking about and he will cause to come
[1:01:10] down for you the rain the former rain
[1:01:12] teaching rain and the latter rain which
[1:01:15] is the Harvest rain in the first month
[1:01:18] there's not many things you can plant on
[1:01:21] June the 1st and on June the 30th
[1:01:23] Harvest
[1:01:24] it except for the Bride of Jesus
[1:01:28] Christ and that's what he's talking
[1:01:30] about and the floor shall be full of
[1:01:32] Wheat and the fat shall overflow with
[1:01:34] wine and oil and I will restore to you
[1:01:36] the years that the Locust is eat cat
[1:01:39] cankerworm caterpillar Palmer worm my
[1:01:41] great Army which I sent among you and
[1:01:44] you shall eat in plenty and be
[1:01:46] satisfied and praise the name of the
[1:01:48] Lord your God that hath dwelt wondrously
[1:01:50] with you and my people shall never be
[1:01:52] ashamed and you shall know that I am in
[1:01:54] the midst of Israel and that I am the
[1:01:56] Lord your God and none else and my
[1:01:58] people shall never be
[1:02:00] ashamed mf's interpretation is I will
[1:02:04] make up to you for the years that have
[1:02:07] been eatting in other words 1 two three
[1:02:09] those three ages had the full word of
[1:02:11] God Satan got involved corn of wheat had
[1:02:14] to go back in the ground but God
[1:02:16] promised brother Michael that he's going
[1:02:19] to restore but what he's going to do
[1:02:21] he's going to make up to us for the
[1:02:23] years of those Dark Ages
[1:02:26] are The New American Bible says I will
[1:02:28] repay you for the years which the Locust
[1:02:31] eat the grasshopper devour cutter my
[1:02:33] great Army which I sent among
[1:02:35] you Ezekiel
[1:02:38] 47:2 then I brought me out of the way of
[1:02:40] the gate northward and led me about the
[1:02:42] way without unto the utter gate by the
[1:02:44] way that lookth Eastward and behold
[1:02:47] there ran out waters on the right side
[1:02:50] and when the man that had the line in
[1:02:52] his hand went forth Eastward he measured
[1:02:54] a thousand cubics and he brought me
[1:02:56] through the waters now what's Waters
[1:02:58] Waters is people and the waters were to
[1:03:01] the
[1:03:02] ankles again he measured a thousand
[1:03:04] brought me through the waters it was to
[1:03:06] the
[1:03:07] knees again he measured a thousand and
[1:03:09] brought me through the waters were to
[1:03:11] the
[1:03:12] loins afterwards he measured a thousand
[1:03:15] and it was a river now that's four
[1:03:18] stages right ankles knees
[1:03:22] loins swim in justification
[1:03:25] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:03:27] and the word of God being restored back
[1:03:29] in the end time there's your four stages
[1:03:31] it was a river I could not pass over for
[1:03:33] the waters were risen Waters to swim in
[1:03:35] a river that can not be passed over
[1:03:37] thank God we got water we can swim in we
[1:03:40] don't have ankle deep water anymore we
[1:03:42] have water you can swim you can if you
[1:03:44] want
[1:03:45] to but we believe in a progressive
[1:03:47] revelation we believe in God progresses
[1:03:49] we believe that God is always moving
[1:03:51] he's leading us out into deeper water if
[1:03:53] you want to go
[1:03:56] and he said unto me son of man hast thou
[1:03:58] seen this then he brought me and caused
[1:04:01] me to return back to the brink of the
[1:04:02] brink of the
[1:04:03] river so now the first three ages the
[1:04:07] pure word of God was given there was no
[1:04:10] restoration because it was pure word of
[1:04:11] God coming right from Jesus Christ right
[1:04:13] to Paul Peter and all the different ones
[1:04:15] but then the fourth Church age there was
[1:04:17] a dying out there was a a corn of wheat
[1:04:19] went in the ground but the fifth age and
[1:04:21] the sixth age were reformers the fifth
[1:04:24] age was sardian the six ages
[1:04:26] Philadelphia which was Luther and Wesley
[1:04:28] and then he's going to start restoring
[1:04:31] though but starting a Reformation or
[1:04:34] reform the people watch what brother
[1:04:37] Brown said and I've not found your works
[1:04:40] perfect you haven't come to Perfection
[1:04:43] because we find out now that they had
[1:04:44] justification right here justification I
[1:04:47] believe he's pointing to the chart no I
[1:04:50] beg your pardon justification is right
[1:04:51] here under Luther he corrects himself
[1:04:54] watch
[1:04:56] sanctification is here and here is the
[1:04:58] holy spirit see now that three elements
[1:05:01] that worked in those three Church ages
[1:05:03] that's what it takes to constitute the
[1:05:05] full birth what does it take a full
[1:05:07] birth water blood and life all right
[1:05:09] water breaks blood comes baby comes then
[1:05:13] life all right they were only conceived
[1:05:17] as a little germ in the womb of the
[1:05:18] mother that's right the holy ghost
[1:05:20] coming to birth the third third seal
[1:05:23] brother R said but then if the
[1:05:24] Pentecostal message was the last message
[1:05:27] which justification sanctification
[1:05:28] baptism the Holy Ghost the last three
[1:05:30] messages all right Luther Wesley
[1:05:34] Pentecost and the full restoration of
[1:05:36] the word through the prophet brother
[1:05:38] brandom is what's going to finish this
[1:05:40] thing and take us out of here all right
[1:05:43] the last three messages the last three
[1:05:45] Church ages forms the complete birth
[1:05:48] just like when a woman is having going
[1:05:50] to have her baby the actual first thing
[1:05:52] happens is water next is blood the next
[1:05:55] is life when they killed Jesus the
[1:05:57] substance came from his body to make up
[1:05:58] the new other words the new church or
[1:06:00] the New Birth they stuck his side blood
[1:06:03] and water came out and into thy hands I
[1:06:05] commend my spirit what came from his
[1:06:07] body was water blood and spirit John 5:7
[1:06:10] tells you about
[1:06:15] that so A Lutheran asked brother brandom
[1:06:17] one time said do we have the Holy
[1:06:21] Ghost brother Bram says
[1:06:23] potentially cuz he was looking at
[1:06:25] because they were taught preaching
[1:06:26] justification was it well now look
[1:06:29] justification was it in Martin Luther's
[1:06:30] time but justification wasn't it when
[1:06:33] you were sitting in front of a
[1:06:35] prophet everybody with me it's a
[1:06:38] different situation when it was over
[1:06:39] here if you were to look at Martin
[1:06:41] Luther and talked to Martin Luther that
[1:06:42] was the Holy Ghost that was what God was
[1:06:45] pleased to dwell in the people that had
[1:06:47] a revelation of the just shall live by
[1:06:48] faith but now when you're over here and
[1:06:50] you're a Lutheran and you're in a
[1:06:51] Lutheran denomination and you're looking
[1:06:53] at a prophet across the
[1:06:56] the uh table and you say brother brandom
[1:06:58] where are we what do we have the Holy
[1:07:01] Ghost he says
[1:07:03] potentially because in the Lutheran mind
[1:07:05] is they've got the Holy Ghost it was
[1:07:09] here but God's moved on over here now to
[1:07:11] where justification just gets you
[1:07:12] started because that's what he's going
[1:07:13] to explain now this brother Seminary is
[1:07:17] out in the country and surrounded by
[1:07:18] many acres of Farmland you wonder why
[1:07:21] that
[1:07:22] happened just so brother R could explain
[1:07:24] this right here and the guy can
[1:07:26] understand it many acres of Farmland on
[1:07:29] which the students can work and thereby
[1:07:31] pay their way through college not get it
[1:07:33] give to them by the government hello he
[1:07:35] also has factories that go along with
[1:07:38] the farm to give added employment so
[1:07:40] using his fields to illustrate my case I
[1:07:42] said once there was a man who went forth
[1:07:44] on his own ground to plant a field of
[1:07:47] corn he pulled up the stumps cleared the
[1:07:49] Rocks plowed and disc it up then planted
[1:07:52] his corn each morning he looked out
[1:07:54] across the field but one morning instead
[1:07:56] of bearing ground he saw myriads of
[1:07:58] little blades coming up he said praise
[1:08:01] God for my Field of Corn I then asked
[1:08:05] him did the man have
[1:08:07] corn and the man said well in one way he
[1:08:11] did I said potentially yes that was you
[1:08:15] Lutheran in the
[1:08:19] Reformation putting forth your blade
[1:08:21] seed the corn began to grow after it had
[1:08:23] rotted in the ground during the dark Ag
[1:08:25] and he continued on to tell him though
[1:08:27] he had to update his
[1:08:28] Revelation to where justification was
[1:08:30] just getting you started in this church
[1:08:32] age all right so justification is what
[1:08:36] we were talking about the other day if
[1:08:38] we look at justification sanctification
[1:08:40] baptism of the Holy Ghost as the outer
[1:08:41] Court inner court and holy of
[1:08:43] holies Luther's justification put them
[1:08:46] in the body but the justification that
[1:08:48] you and I are under today it only clears
[1:08:50] out your past sin it only gets rid of
[1:08:52] what you did before all right and you're
[1:08:55] still in the outer court now brother R
[1:08:57] talks about the outer court now that's a
[1:08:59] sign or type of the people the
[1:09:01] regenerated man who comes to Christ
[1:09:03] gives his life but never become hid away
[1:09:05] into the Holy Spirit he lives a life
[1:09:08] that he knows he's eating Mana there's
[1:09:10] many people today that's never went any
[1:09:13] further than the outer court and I'm
[1:09:14] going to say today there's many people
[1:09:16] in this
[1:09:17] message that you get taught that false
[1:09:20] teaching that all you got to do is s a
[1:09:22] message church and believe God sent a
[1:09:24] prophet and that se inside of you just
[1:09:26] going to come love aivee that was put
[1:09:27] there before the foundation of the world
[1:09:29] there's truth to
[1:09:31] that but I told the preacher the other
[1:09:33] day I said look I'm just going to preach
[1:09:35] good old salvation in my
[1:09:38] church it's my church now I'm going to
[1:09:41] preach justification sanctification the
[1:09:43] baptism of the Holy Ghost seed comes to
[1:09:45] life I said you can tell your people
[1:09:47] that they always was eternal and the
[1:09:49] seed was always there and they can just
[1:09:52] do I said but the Bible and brother
[1:09:55] brandham tells in the future home he
[1:09:58] gets right to the end of his ministry
[1:09:59] and he says thank God for these three
[1:10:01] works are steps of Grace he said I
[1:10:03] preached it when I was a boy this was
[1:10:05] after the seals a lot of people say well
[1:10:07] after the seals he said just believe you
[1:10:09] know seed's going to just pop to life I
[1:10:11] believe it does pop to life I believe
[1:10:13] you do have predestination you do have
[1:10:16] representation God can't change his mind
[1:10:19] if he ever loved you if he ever if you
[1:10:21] ever were part of him there you're part
[1:10:23] of him now but you got to go to a
[1:10:25] process to where you can see it to where
[1:10:27] you can believe it in the mind of God
[1:10:29] you never were
[1:10:33] lost that's why when we come to True
[1:10:35] justification over here under the seals
[1:10:38] the real you never did it and you got to
[1:10:41] start realizing that that the real you
[1:10:43] didn't do it now the other part of you
[1:10:46] is going to help you remember that you
[1:10:48] did
[1:10:49] it what the carnal mind
[1:10:51] part but you got to overcome that but if
[1:10:55] you stay in the outer Court look there's
[1:10:57] many people today that's never went any
[1:10:58] further than the outer Court the veil
[1:11:01] yet they are Christians now watch
[1:11:02] brother Brandon by the
[1:11:05] millions they enjoy Christ in an outward
[1:11:09] form they go to church with a
[1:11:11] consolation of knowing they belong to
[1:11:13] church but they have never become hid
[1:11:16] away with him in the in
[1:11:20] course God sent a prophet go to church
[1:11:23] don't cut your hair read read your Bible
[1:11:27] listen to The Prophet's
[1:11:29] message that don't say none of that I
[1:11:31] just said saved any one of you not one
[1:11:35] thing I said saved
[1:11:38] you so don't worry about that teaching
[1:11:41] it's it's not false it's just not
[1:11:43] exactly all true yes in the mind of God
[1:11:46] you always were seed PR changed his
[1:11:50] mind but when we come through the veil
[1:11:53] of Adam and Eve where we were supposed
[1:11:54] to be born born by Spoken
[1:11:56] Word everybody with me we were supposed
[1:11:59] to be born by Spoken Word just like you
[1:12:01] were with at your new birth you were
[1:12:03] supposed to be born spoken word children
[1:12:05] no sex involved but once you come
[1:12:07] through that Veil that sex Veil brother
[1:12:09] Bri said our eyes have been open and we
[1:12:11] have to have intercourse to have kids
[1:12:13] you come back to where it says it's the
[1:12:15] fall that's why they call it fall cuz
[1:12:18] you
[1:12:19] fa and you have to be restored yes I can
[1:12:22] go over here and I can look back being
[1:12:24] in the message now something years I can
[1:12:26] look back and see that I always was
[1:12:28] eternal I can see I always was in the
[1:12:30] mind of God my Lord Genesis 1: 126 my
[1:12:33] favorite scripture that puts me in the
[1:12:35] mind of God before the foundation of the
[1:12:36] world but I had a time down here I was
[1:12:39] lost you were lost you were dead that's
[1:12:43] right and on your way to hell if you
[1:12:45] don't have a new birth experience Jesus
[1:12:47] did not tell Nicodemus Nicodemus just
[1:12:50] believe
[1:12:52] me
[1:12:53] right Nicodemus you always
[1:12:57] was just believe it he said Nicodemus
[1:13:01] you must be born from above something
[1:13:05] has to come from somewhere to get inside
[1:13:07] of
[1:13:08] you don't let nobody fool
[1:13:14] you and another thing we'll call your
[1:13:17] attention just before we close same here
[1:13:19] look at the light on the outside of the
[1:13:21] Court it was the firmament that Lit it
[1:13:23] up in other words the outer Court was
[1:13:24] wide open if you look going out the door
[1:13:26] turn to the left and look up you'll see
[1:13:28] the outer Court it was actually called
[1:13:31] the court of the Gentiles cuz they could
[1:13:33] walk in that Court couldn't go any
[1:13:35] further but it was just a common area
[1:13:37] and when it rained you got wet when it
[1:13:40] was blistering hot like it is now you
[1:13:43] got
[1:13:45] sunburnt so look some days was
[1:13:48] cloudy some days the sun didn't shine at
[1:13:51] all some days it was dark now that's the
[1:13:55] in the outer Court that's the same way
[1:13:57] with me and you you start your journey
[1:13:59] some days you have good days some days
[1:14:02] you have rainy days some days you have a
[1:14:05] complete tornado some days you have an
[1:14:09] earthquake it's just the outer Court
[1:14:11] that's where you live and you're up and
[1:14:12] down out and in and out up and down you
[1:14:14] can walk in and out but if you go into
[1:14:16] that next part you're getting closer you
[1:14:19] go into that next part it's covered and
[1:14:22] it's got an artificial light a
[1:14:23] Candlestick and it does have Mana you
[1:14:26] can start eating that Mana because it is
[1:14:30] excuse me
[1:14:31] sanctification sanctification is the
[1:14:33] work of the Holy Ghost it gets you
[1:14:34] closer to God but inside that holy of
[1:14:37] holies only one person can go and that's
[1:14:39] you and God and when you go behind that
[1:14:41] there is Mana that never will cease
[1:14:43] there's Mana that's been in there since
[1:14:44] the foundation of the world I'm talking
[1:14:46] about the Holy Ghost has been in that
[1:14:48] and you got to go get it
[1:14:51] yes the priest didn't come out and say I
[1:14:53] don't need to eat that I already got it
[1:14:54] in me no he needed to eat it same way
[1:14:57] with me and you you need to eat the word
[1:14:59] of God but during on in
[1:15:02] justification that's the part you and I
[1:15:04] have got to realize we're going to have
[1:15:06] bad days and good
[1:15:07] days but get into the next
[1:15:13] court when he had opened the third seal
[1:15:16] I heard the third Beast now we're
[1:15:17] getting to the Man Age Again behold and
[1:15:19] L a black horse and he that sat on him
[1:15:21] had a pair of balances in his hand and I
[1:15:23] Heard a Voice in the midst of the four
[1:15:24] Beast saying measure of wheat for penny
[1:15:26] three measures of barley for a penny and
[1:15:28] see thou not
[1:15:30] hurt the oil of the wine the Holy Ghost
[1:15:34] is coming back in power it's coming back
[1:15:36] to the fullness of the word it's not
[1:15:38] there yet but it's coming to it listen
[1:15:43] praise God for not just dumping all this
[1:15:45] on top of us praise God for him giving
[1:15:48] us progressive revelation or a time to
[1:15:52] be justified a time to be sanctified
[1:15:55] and a time to be filled with the Holy
[1:15:58] Ghost amen cuz see that's my journey I
[1:16:01] know my journey when God Justified me he
[1:16:04] chopped off all my past
[1:16:06] sins then he Sanctified me he started
[1:16:09] cleaning me up I was baptized in the
[1:16:11] name of the Lord Jesus started coming to
[1:16:13] church I felt so empty inside well
[1:16:15] that's good but you better get it filled
[1:16:17] with something cuz Satan will come back
[1:16:19] and fill it up according to the B Book
[1:16:20] of Luke it says the unclean Spirit goes
[1:16:22] out walks in dry places seeks rest
[1:16:24] findest none comes back and sees the
[1:16:26] house swept and garnished you're in
[1:16:28] church then he's going to bring seven
[1:16:30] demons worse than he is and he's going
[1:16:32] to say send that message church right
[1:16:34] there and you just believe that you
[1:16:35] always was and you had this eternal seed
[1:16:37] inside of you and come on people that's
[1:16:41] a lie that is a lie you did not have
[1:16:44] eternal life in your soul when you were
[1:16:47] born I didn't maybe I'm different but I
[1:16:50] didn't the things I did
[1:16:54] God said I will not dwell in an unclean
[1:16:58] vessel the old Indian said after me Born
[1:17:02] Again In Me are two dogs after because
[1:17:06] remember before you were just black
[1:17:09] dog then when the Holy Ghost comes in he
[1:17:12] slides that black guy out into the what
[1:17:14] into the spirit realm and they start
[1:17:17] battling each other I didn't have a
[1:17:19] battle when I was a
[1:17:21] sinner right pray for me what pray for
[1:17:25] me now cuz I ain't a sinner no more but
[1:17:27] at that time I was a sinner I didn't
[1:17:29] have no battles I could hold a beer it
[1:17:32] wouldn't bother me I can say bad words
[1:17:34] it didn't bother me but when I come
[1:17:36] under conviction yes something came to
[1:17:38] life but it was the word of God that I
[1:17:41] heard it's the word of God you heard
[1:17:42] there's your seed the seed is a word of
[1:17:45] God God does not have
[1:17:47] sperm sorry so plain but God's not like
[1:17:50] a man like that he doesn't need that his
[1:17:53] his seed is the word of God and as it
[1:17:55] goes forward spiritual multiplication
[1:17:57] happens
[1:18:00] look
[1:18:01] amen so we start with that church age
[1:18:05] that brought us out of the Dark Ages
[1:18:07] come up out of the ground two little
[1:18:08] shoots coming up that was justification
[1:18:11] that was a work of the Holy Ghost and
[1:18:13] now we'll look at the Philadelphia and
[1:18:15] church age just for a second and then
[1:18:16] we'll then we'll uh start next week
[1:18:19] because we'll have next week to to
[1:18:22] minister to just pray for us we have a
[1:18:25] tough week coming up to the angel of the
[1:18:27] church in Philadelphia write these
[1:18:28] things sayith he that is Holy he that is

[1:18:37] Works behold I have set before thee an
[1:18:39] open door and no man can shut it for
[1:18:42] thou Hast a little strength what a
[1:18:44] little bit of Doctrine this truth Luther
[1:18:47] had a little bit he had two shoot
[1:18:49] strength I mean look look the life of
[1:18:52] that seed's inside there
[1:18:55] don't look like it at the time but
[1:18:57] whatever was down in here that life the
[1:18:59] first thing it popped up is Two Shoes
[1:19:02] then you got a stock then it looks a
[1:19:04] little bit closer in a tassel and then
[1:19:06] you got to take the tassel or the shuck
[1:19:08] and pull it away and there's your True
[1:19:10] Grain but the life is still in every bit
[1:19:13] of that but remember the life of those
[1:19:15] two shoots leaves and goes into the
[1:19:17] stock goes from the stock and goes into
[1:19:20] the tassel out of the tassel into the
[1:19:23] full corn all right

[1:19:28] kept my word and Hast not denied my name

[1:19:33] of Satan which say they are Jews and are
[1:19:35] not but do lie behold I will make them
[1:19:38] to come in worship before thy feet and
[1:19:40] to know that I have loved
[1:19:42] thee because thou Hast kept the word of
[1:19:44] my patience I also will keep thee from
[1:19:47] the hour of
[1:19:48] Temptation praise God for that which
[1:19:51] shall come upon all the Earth yes
[1:19:55] we're tempted by something every single
[1:19:59] day you wake up in the morning and you

[1:20:04] pages and an ad pops
[1:20:07] up yeah keep me from the hour of

[1:20:32] temple of my God oh my hold the hold the
[1:20:34] church up he's going to hold the church
[1:20:36] up with
[1:20:37] you that's what a pillar does not a
[1:20:40] pillow which some of you need now a
[1:20:42] pillow but a
[1:20:44] pillar something that holds the church
[1:20:46] up that's what's right in front of y'all
[1:20:48] right there those poles those are
[1:20:50] pillars that Gary Brother Gary CR hates
[1:20:52] those but that's okay we'll use them for
[1:20:54] a little
[1:20:56] while and I will Rite and I I don't like
[1:20:59] him either and he shall go no more out
[1:21:01] and I will ride upon him the name of my
[1:21:03] God and the name of the city of my God
[1:21:04] this is getting pretty close to the Lord
[1:21:06] you know and the name of the city of my
[1:21:08] God which is New Jerusalem was name name
[1:21:11] name name the name is fixing to be
[1:21:14] restored back to the church now it
[1:21:16] wasn't fully in in Luther it wasn't
[1:21:18] fully in Wesley but when you come to
[1:21:20] Pentecost and then the restoration under
[1:21:23] brother brandham the name comes
[1:21:25] back and I'm not going to worry about
[1:21:28] I'll write upon him my new
[1:21:30] name brother R said we'd get that name
[1:21:33] so let God give you that name I'm not
[1:21:35] going to I just want to be called
[1:21:38] Christian he that ha A near let him hear
[1:21:40] what the spirit saith un the churches
[1:21:42] Revelations 3:8 I Know Thy Works behold
[1:21:46] I have set before thee an open door and
[1:21:48] no man can shut it for thou Hast a
[1:21:50] little strength and Hast kept my word
[1:21:52] and Hast not denied my name watch what
[1:21:54] brother Brown says the first phrase of
[1:21:57] this verse I Know Thy works is analyzed
[1:22:00] in the rest of the verse for their Works
[1:22:02] had to do with the open door little
[1:22:05] strength the word and the name in order
[1:22:07] to understand the wealth of meaning
[1:22:09] involved in behold I set before you an
[1:22:11] Open Door no man can shut it we must now
[1:22:13] recall what has been said about each age
[1:22:16] running over into another now he's
[1:22:18] talking about lap over we talked about
[1:22:19] it before but each age runs over into
[1:22:22] the next Church age God doesn't show
[1:22:24] shut it off abruptly he runs it over
[1:22:26] into the other age all right so watch
[1:22:28] this there is an overlapping so what
[1:22:31] happened is Wesley is going to take what
[1:22:33] Luther had come on Wesley's going to
[1:22:36] take what Luther had by the Holy Ghost
[1:22:38] he's going to use it cuz he believed in
[1:22:41] justification he believed Martin
[1:22:43] Luther's writings CU he said he did in
[1:22:44] his writings but he wanted he knew there
[1:22:47] was something further that the
[1:22:49] Pentecostals can pull out
[1:22:52] sanctification cuz the ages lap over
[1:22:55] there's an overlapping a melting or
[1:22:57] Fading Into rather than an Abrupt end
[1:23:00] and a clear-cut start this age
[1:23:03] particularly flows into the next age and
[1:23:07] not only does this age overflow into the
[1:23:09] last age that's where we're at but the
[1:23:11] last age is in many respects simply a
[1:23:14] carrying on of the sixth age the seventh
[1:23:18] age a very short age gathers up into
[1:23:20] itself for one quick work all the evil
[1:23:23] of every age and yet all the reality of
[1:23:25] Pentecost once the Philadelphian age has
[1:23:28] about run its course the leosan age
[1:23:30] quickly comes in bringing both the tears
[1:23:32] in the wheat to harvest first find the
[1:23:35] tears to burn them but gather the wheat
[1:23:37] into my
[1:23:38] barn Matthew 13:30 remember please that
[1:23:41] the sardian church AE started the
[1:23:43] Reformation that must still go on until
[1:23:45] the grain that was planted at Pentecost
[1:23:48] goes through the full cycle of planting
[1:23:51] watering nourishing Etc until it comes
[1:23:54] right back to the original seed while
[1:23:56] this is going on the tears that were
[1:23:59] sewn will have to go through their cycle
[1:24:01] and be harvested too so in other words
[1:24:03] Satan is right there again same one pale
[1:24:05] horse rider he's right there riding and
[1:24:07] the
[1:24:08] tears are the unbelief of the church now
[1:24:13] watch this and we'll close right here I
[1:24:14] want you to see something here God works
[1:24:16] in threes doesn't he it was in the third
[1:24:19] or perian age that the church was
[1:24:21] married to the state remember we went
[1:24:23] through that during the age of
[1:24:26] um the Third Church age pergami Church
[1:24:29] age the church was married to the state
[1:24:30] remember Constantine married church and
[1:24:33] state together the Deeds of the nicians
[1:24:35] had become the doctrine of the nicians
[1:24:38] that age was the open door look for the
[1:24:41] false Vine now God's fixing an open door
[1:24:43] for the True Vine now in this age we're
[1:24:45] going to talk about Philadelphia but he
[1:24:46] but Satan opened it up way back here in
[1:24:48] that third Church age that age was the
[1:24:51] open door for the false Vine once it was
[1:24:54] back up by the power of the state it
[1:24:56] became actually a world system even
[1:24:58] though it bore the name Christian thus
[1:25:01] it spread like wildfire but now Three
[1:25:03] Ages later after a long and hard
[1:25:06] struggle of Faith here comes the open
[1:25:08] door to the
[1:25:09] truth the word of the Lord now has its
[1:25:12] day of course the fifth age had set the
[1:25:14] stage for this Mighty move as that age
[1:25:17] gave us exploration colonization the
[1:25:19] printing of books and the man's name was
[1:25:23] John West ly that was a messenger to the
[1:25:26] a let's stand at our
[1:25:30] feet we get into better and better good
[1:25:33] and

[1:25:47] already already know
[1:25:50] this but then you got somebody like the
[1:25:52] other day brother Andre head came by and

[1:27:22] to life inside of us and we started
[1:27:24] growing as little babies two little
