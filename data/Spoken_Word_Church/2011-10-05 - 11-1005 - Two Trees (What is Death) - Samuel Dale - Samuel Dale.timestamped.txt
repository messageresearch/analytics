[29:27] amen
[29:29] Genesis
[29:32] 2 we'll read verse 8 and N9 the Lord God
[29:37] planted a garden planted a garden
[29:40] Eastward in Eden and there he put the
[29:42] man whom he had formed out of the ground
[29:45] made he the made the Lord to grow every
[29:48] tree that is Pleasant to the sight and
[29:51] good for food the tree of life also in
[29:54] the midst of the garden and the tree of
[29:56] knowledge of Good and Evil now remember
[29:58] all the trees were there but then there
[30:00] was two trees cuz that's what we're
[30:02] going to be speaking about a little
[30:07] bit is those two
[30:10] trees cuz I believe they're still here
[30:12] amen CU it's not natural trees it wasn't
[30:15] an apple tree an orange tree or whatever
[30:17] you know amen it wasn't in that okay now
[30:19] let's go to 1 Corinthians 15:
[30:24] 20 but now is Christ risen from the dead
[30:27] and become the first fruits of them that
[30:29] slept for Since By Man Came Death By Man
[30:32] Al came also the resurrection of the
[30:35] dead as in Adam all die even so in
[30:38] Christ shall all be made alive every man
[30:40] in his own order Christ the first
[30:43] fruits afterward they that are Christ at
[30:46] his coming then cometh the end when he
[30:49] shall have delivered up the kingdom of
[30:51] God even the
[30:53] father when he shall have put down all
[30:56] Rule and all all authority and power for
[30:59] he must reain till he hath put all
[31:01] enemies under his
[31:02] feet The Last Enemy that shall be
[31:05] destroyed is
[31:07] death for he he hath put all things
[31:10] under his feet but when he saith all
[31:13] things are put under him it is Manifest
[31:15] that he is accepted which did put all
[31:18] things under him and when all things
[31:20] shall be subdued unto him then shall the
[31:23] son also himself be subject unto him
[31:27] that put all things under him that God
[31:30] may be all in all you may be seated the
[31:35] Lord add his Blessing to the reading of
[31:37] the
[31:39] word
[31:41] now we come down through our studies and
[31:44] I had kind of forgotten that I was
[31:47] supposed to speak on this and you know
[31:50] trying to move on into the to the uh
[31:54] preaching and uh you know so I decided
[31:58] that I just drop back and put in a
[31:59] message tonight on this to where that we
[32:02] could could uh follow the thought you
[32:05] remember we spent about probably eight
[32:08] messages speaking of about heaven and
[32:11] how real it is and and God and how real
[32:15] he is and and then coming down to the
[32:17] garden and and the things and and taking
[32:21] place there in the garden and what
[32:23] happened with Eve and uh but I want you
[32:26] to think about something there was two
[32:27] trees there right we read all right the
[32:32] tree of life and the tree of knowledge
[32:33] of Good and Evil amen now as I said it's
[32:36] not two apple it's not an apple tree and
[32:38] an orange tree or some kind of a trees
[32:41] we know who that was the the tree of
[32:43] life is Jesus Christ amen and the tree
[32:46] of knowledge of Good and Evil is Satan
[32:49] right in his
[32:51] perversion but now here's what I want
[32:54] you to look at because it's a very odd
[32:57] scripture especially in the way we
[33:01] think uh we read here that The Last
[33:07] Enemy that shall be destroyed is death
[33:11] amen right well see now
[33:15] that you
[33:17] know that's an odd way of saying
[33:21] it because I thought Jesus
[33:25] Christ
[33:27] destroyed every enemy
[33:30] right but there's one enemy to be
[33:34] destroyed and that's death right so now
[33:39] what is
[33:43] death why would it state it that way
[33:46] that The Last Enemy that shall be you
[33:51] know right the other scripture we come
[33:53] on over and and talking about Jesus and
[33:56] it says that that we don't see all
[33:59] things but said we see
[34:02] Jesus all right now so don't lose me in
[34:06] the
[34:08] thought of what I'm trying to get Jesus
[34:10] Christ paid the price for everything
[34:14] right amen but there's one enemy that
[34:16] has not been
[34:18] destroyed and that is death amen you
[34:22] said yeah he destroyed death at Calvary
[34:24] okay now follow me throughout the
[34:26] message and you'll get a
[34:30] point death for the soul has been
[34:33] destroyed because we have the new birth
[34:36] that's right that destroys death to the
[34:38] soul amen but it doesn't destroy
[34:42] dying of the human body right amen so
[34:46] that's why Paul is saying The Last Enemy
[34:49] to be destroyed that shall Bey one day
[34:52] will be death amen but what truly is
[34:56] death death brother Mo I remember about
[34:59] 40 something years ago he made the
[35:01] statement he said you can't know what
[35:03] life is unless you know what death is
[35:06] and that's been with me ever since
[35:08] because you know I like to look at
[35:10] things of that order but Paul said The
[35:13] Last Enemy that shall be
[35:16] destroyed is death amen MH right now why
[35:23] would it be made that way why wouldn't
[35:25] why wouldn't Paul say
[35:27] way cuzz he's talking about Jesus Christ
[35:30] and his death and his the resurrection
[35:33] and Etc coming on through why wouldn't
[35:35] he say that you
[35:38] know we see everything
[35:41] destroyed right because he knew man was
[35:44] still dying that's right as long as
[35:48] we're
[35:49] dying then The Last Enemy is not
[35:52] destroyed
[35:54] right you say well yes it is brother
[35:57] it's been well you're
[35:58] dying right you want to tell me you're
[36:01] not getting older that's right you want
[36:04] to argue about the white hires and no
[36:06] hires or whatever you know I mean just
[36:12] look in the mirror and you'll find out
[36:13] that the light enemy has not been
[36:16] destroyed
[36:18] yet all right so if the light enemy has
[36:21] not been destroyed which is physical
[36:24] death all right right amen come on
[36:26] that's right physical death is not
[36:29] destroyed the price has been paid
[36:32] everything's been
[36:34] done but there's something about that
[36:38] that leavs death to be taking all of us
[36:43] right right that's right it took the
[36:46] prophet even in his greatest of
[36:50] understanding it took him to a natural
[36:52] death that's right amen all right MH now
[36:56] so then what is
[37:05] death death is the first death in the
[37:09] natural in the Bible was when Kan killed
[37:13] AEL right Genesis
[37:16] 4 but see death was there before then
[37:21] yep what happened with Cain and Abel was
[37:25] that
[37:28] Cain put forth the attribute of what his
[37:31] death he had within him
[37:34] right Cain was had already experienced
[37:40] death he said wait a minute Kan G was
[37:43] live see then you're not
[37:46] listening
[37:49] right when Cain turned down the revealed
[37:54] word he was dead amen right amen you
[37:59] following me am he was spiritually dead
[38:03] amen right amen when he turned down the
[38:06] revealed word when Abel told
[38:10] him what God had told him that was the
[38:13] revealed word
[38:14] right so death was back there behind or
[38:19] back before the natural act the natural
[38:23] Act of Abel and Cain was the attribute
[38:26] of kain's death right that he had
[38:29] already working within him
[38:33] amen so then death was the thing that
[38:36] happened when
[38:37] Eve disbelieved God's
[38:41] word she spiritually died right and not
[38:46] physically right we're going to get to
[38:49] that in a minute now so you're going to
[38:50] have to hold tight with me tonight and
[38:54] listen so what is that
[38:59] death see we say death is well you go
[39:01] down to the Undertaker and the guy's
[39:02] laying in the coffin you know well
[39:04] that's de no that's the
[39:10] attribute see the reason we're dying is
[39:13] because of the disbelieve in God's word
[39:16] right right that causes the physical
[39:20] death that's right when we come to a
[39:23] place listen when we get to the place
[39:27] that spiritual death is conquered within
[39:29] you and
[39:30] I then and then only can natural death
[39:34] be destroyed that's what Paul's
[39:39] saying he saying we see Jesus we see
[39:41] these things you know through his
[39:43] writings but it said we're still
[39:46] physically dying right all right so then
[39:50] if we're physically dying something's
[39:52] wrong mhm
[39:55] right you said well what we need to do
[39:58] is is to to get dying stopped maybe we
[40:01] can find some kind of appe peel some
[40:03] kind of a a a a a thing to be given to a
[40:08] person you know that can reverse it boy
[40:12] you'd be instantly Rich if you could you
[40:14] know but there's no such
[40:18] thing Pon Leon never found the Fountain
[40:21] of
[40:22] Youth I think he was a one hunting part
[40:25] wouldn't he that's right travel across
[40:27] the country trying to find a fountain of
[40:29] youth you know what he believes
[40:32] somebody's lie right cuz somebody lied
[40:35] to the old boy right somebody told him
[40:39] way over there you know you get over
[40:43] there and you'll find a fountain of
[40:46] youth well now wouldn't that kind of
[40:49] like what happened in heaven as we've
[40:52] been talking about that the Angels
[40:54] believe Satan's lie yeah right and then
[40:59] in the
[41:00] garden yep Eve believed Satan's lie MH
[41:04] right it brought spiritual
[41:08] death right right cuz the day you eat
[41:12] thereof that day you die amen she died
[41:15] spiritually that's right all right but
[41:18] she didn't die physically Noe that's
[41:21] right that was a 100 or 200 or 400 years
[41:25] I don't know how old she ever Liv I
[41:26] don't really know where there's a record
[41:28] of Adam and Eve in their amount of time
[41:30] to
[41:32] live but are you following what I'm
[41:34] saying that
[41:36] right so death is not the fact of
[41:41] somebody cutting your throat and your
[41:43] heart quits beating that's the
[41:46] attribute of what really death truly is
[41:50] Right amen go death is to disbelief
[41:53] God's word amen all right now
[41:57] what I want to do is read something to
[41:59] you I won't try to explain it until
[42:02] later end of the message all right but I
[42:05] want to to read it to you so go ahead
[42:07] brother and pull it up so let's just
[42:09] read something brother right and say
[42:12] it you might I'm going to ask you a
[42:14] question when I finish with this that
[42:16] might be a shock to
[42:17] you all
[42:20] right so
[42:23] just think about these things
[42:30] brother R starts off on paragraph 90
[42:32] this will be 90 91 93 on through in the
[42:37] breach which is in the seal
[42:43] book said as when a person is struck
[42:45] with disease aches and
[42:48] pains one time there wasn't that way but
[42:52] they're groaning why they're not right
[42:55] there's something wrong they're groaning
[42:56] and trying to get back to where they was
[42:59] when they had help and when Nature and
[43:02] people as the Bible said are groaning it
[43:04] shows there something that they're not
[43:06] in ought to be conditioned they have
[43:09] fallen from somewhere right now
[43:13] immediately get the point while he's
[43:15] rolling it up to paragraph 91 get the
[43:18] point that I want you to to
[43:21] Exel that this is not just talking about
[43:24] Adam and Eve right
[43:28] all right I'll repeat this in a minute
[43:31] but I want that in your mind this is not
[43:33] just talking about Adam and Eve that's
[43:35] what he's just saying he's talking about
[43:37] a person that's struck with a disease
[43:39] it's talking about T
[43:41] die right it's talking about us y right
[43:45] all right see now he goes to express the
[43:49] thought and look what he says now we
[43:52] don't need no anybody to interpret that
[43:55] for us see for of course we know it was
[43:58] eternal life that they had fallen
[44:02] from now
[44:04] that's I said I'm not going to explain
[44:06] this for a few minutes but I want this
[44:07] into to your
[44:09] thought and they lost their claims on
[44:11] eternal life by the fall of Adam and Eve
[44:14] see so it's not talking just Adam and
[44:16] Eve who fell from eternal life to death
[44:18] in the Garden of Eden and brought all
[44:20] nature under them to death a tree never
[44:23] died before Adam and an animal an animal
[44:25] Wouldn't Die before Adam there's only
[44:27] one thing that cannot die and that's God
[44:29] because he's Eternal that's the only way
[44:32] we can ever keep from dying we have to
[44:35] have eternal life in us to be Sons and
[44:37] Daughters of God but when we died as I
[44:40] said in the message this morning to sin
[44:43] we sold out our Birthright and crossed
[44:47] this CM now we're beyond the reach of
[44:49] God on this other side of the castle
[44:53] right so now he's not just talking about
[44:58] Adam and Eve he's talking about all of
[45:01] us so get the story now now what now of
[45:05] course when Adam fell to death he
[45:07] brought death upon all
[45:08] creation now he was given through more
[45:11] agen it was given to them just as
[45:16] we so to make a choice now Adam and Eve
[45:20] in the beginning there was a tree of
[45:21] right and wrong before them and that
[45:24] same tree said
[45:26] before each and and every one of us see
[45:30] God isn't doing for Adam or for Eve you
[45:33] said well it isn't their fault
[45:37] no not now it isn't it's your fault you
[45:41] can't place it on Adam now you got to
[45:44] place it on yourself because right and
[45:46] wrong is set before you we're on the
[45:48] same basis as Adam and Eve all right now
[45:54] so my point is what
[46:00] I want to ask you a question I spoke on
[46:03] this line before on many things and
[46:05] we'll get back to it in a little bit all
[46:06] right but I want to ask you a
[46:11] question is it
[46:16] possible that we could
[46:19] fall the same way Adam and Eve
[46:24] fell
[46:27] ain't got no amens or nowhere yet ain't
[46:30] even got a
[46:31] headshake but uh you know that when I
[46:35] ask the question sometimes it's better
[46:37] to wait for a while to find out what I'm
[46:40] talking
[46:41] about but is it possible tonight because
[46:45] we' just shown by the prophet that
[46:47] that's not just talking about Adam and
[46:50] Eve that's talking about all mankind
[46:54] right and that we're in the same
[46:56] situation y that Adam and Eve was in
[47:01] right
[47:04] right so
[47:07] now keep that in
[47:09] mind is it
[47:14] possible that we can fall the same way
[47:18] that Adam and Eve fell in the
[47:22] garden now write these down brother life
[47:25] in want to go but they couldn't read
[47:26] when I wrote but that's all right I try
[47:28] to read it if it don't get too cold I
[47:30] can read it but a few days later I have
[47:31] to figure out what I'm
[47:34] saying but I just ask you to do one
[47:36] thing with me tonight don't try to
[47:39] figure out what I'm
[47:42] saying I I'll tell you what I'm going to
[47:45] say now that's where people gets me
[47:47] confused see they they don't listen to
[47:50] the words I use right they just
[47:52] something is said in their computer go
[47:55] click
[47:57] because how many of you click when I ask
[47:59] the question is it possible that we
[48:02] could fall like Adam and
[48:10] Eve your computer clicks and sometimes
[48:13] you don't listen to the rest of the
[48:16] message but I would listen and maybe
[48:18] even go back and play the tape if you
[48:20] need
[48:22] to don't try to interpret me just listen
[48:26] to what I
[48:27] say and then we'll ask God to try to
[48:30] interpret it to all of us all
[48:33] right see by the fall of Adam and Eve it
[48:38] brought the whole human
[48:40] race into a lost
[48:45] condition we lost our claim on eternal
[48:49] life now read this in a minute we lost
[48:53] our claim on eternal
[48:56] Life by Adam and
[48:59] Eve the same two
[49:02] trees sets before us today amen that's
[49:06] right that set before Adam and
[49:09] Eve we must decide which
[49:13] tree we're going to eat off of right
[49:16] amen that's right my brother D I'm just
[49:19] I'm just simpleminded and I'm just I
[49:21] just love the Lord and I'm just eating
[49:23] off the tree of
[49:24] life uh we were studying there in the
[49:27] bible study this past Saturday
[49:32] night and you know that
[49:34] Paul made an outstanding
[49:39] statement he had spent his entire life
[49:43] serving the great Jehovah God you agree
[49:46] right amen studying preparing to either
[49:50] be a the prophet said a lawyer or even a
[49:54] priest
[49:56] yet he made an outstanding
[49:59] statement he said the thing that I
[50:02] thought was
[50:05] life I found to be
[50:09] death you remember that in the scripture
[50:12] right the thing that I thought was
[50:16] life what was he talking
[50:19] about the keeping of the law right or
[50:23] the law the Commandments of God
[50:26] the word of
[50:30] God and you know if Christ did not
[50:33] come he would have been all right right
[50:37] that's right true right amen cuz he was
[50:40] keeping the law right that's right he
[50:43] would have had to been judged by the law
[50:47] right or the Commandments right but when
[50:49] Christ came he
[50:53] saw that those Commandments was not a
[50:56] book of
[50:58] rules but it was a
[51:01] revelation of the person of almighty God
[51:07] right and see to him was to follow it by
[51:10] natural carnal or excuse
[51:13] me natural reading not to call it carnal
[51:16] because we're you
[51:19] know he thought by studying the word and
[51:23] keeping the word to the letter right
[51:26] was his salvation
[51:30] yeah what about
[51:33] it what about you and
[51:39] I which tree are we eating off
[51:45] of now the question comes
[51:50] up about what the prophet had to say
[51:59] he said Adam and Eve he said we fa all
[52:01] of us Adam and
[52:03] Eve fail from eternal
[52:07] life to death y in the
[52:15] garden
[52:17] now what is he talking
[52:21] about well he you said what he talking
[52:24] about fell from eternal life to death in
[52:26] the garden he he just said it he's he
[52:29] just he he's plain he made himself
[52:32] plain
[52:37] but can you fall from eternal
[52:45] life is it possible to
[52:49] fall from eternal
[52:54] life well it looks like that's what the
[52:56] prophet is
[53:04] saying but what truly is
[53:11] death death was already in the garden
[53:14] before Cain killed
[53:18] Abel right death was for Eve to accept
[53:23] Satan's lie right amen right it brought
[53:27] her to
[53:29] death all
[53:31] right what happened to her she
[53:36] died remember a Eve had the
[53:40] word that told
[53:43] her cuz Genesis 2 you know he's put into
[53:46] the to the U flesh right remember all
[53:50] right now even though Eve maybe was not
[53:53] standing there right at the position we
[53:57] read the scripture
[53:59] of she comes into being in Genesis
[54:03] 2 and if she
[54:06] does she's
[54:08] told maybe if not at by God himself
[54:11] being revealed because you could narrow
[54:14] it down and argue over Genesis 2 whether
[54:16] it would be Eve and Adam both standing
[54:18] there when God said you don't eat right
[54:21] just a few verses over from where we
[54:23] read he said don't you eat of that tree
[54:26] of knowledge of Good and
[54:29] Evil he says don't even touch it right
[54:35] amen so whether Eve was standing there
[54:38] or
[54:39] not is beside the point because Adam
[54:42] would have finally told her when she
[54:43] come into
[54:45] big right right don't eat of the tree of
[54:48] knowledge of Good and Evil don't touch
[54:50] it cuz you do you'll die right right cuz
[54:53] Satan comes along to right and as he
[54:56] comes along and he starts explaining and
[54:59] she she starts doing her preaching job
[55:02] she's telling him you know oh yeah we
[55:05] need every one of these trees but one
[55:07] tree
[55:09] y cuz see Satan said can you eat of all
[55:12] the trees tricking her into starting
[55:14] preaching that's right women preachers
[55:17] all right we'll get to it in a minute
[55:20] because see to believe Satan's lie to
[55:22] serve
[55:23] Satan and that's why you can't tell them
[55:26] brother R said cuz they're anointed
[55:27] right right that's right can you tell a
[55:29] woman preacher that she's not she don't
[55:31] have the right to
[55:33] preach she'll tell you in a hurry God
[55:35] called
[55:37] her and probably could out preach a lot
[55:40] of men they ain't got nothing to do with
[55:42] it right amen that's beside the
[55:46] point you see we look at things like
[55:48] death as just somebody physically
[55:52] dying but what is the reason for us
[55:57] dying why are we
[56:02] dying it's not because we're getting old
[56:05] cuz some of us are a whole lot older
[56:07] than
[56:08] others I'm 71 years old and if I live
[56:11] another hour like brother Brandon would
[56:12] say he said I would outlive a many a
[56:15] young
[56:16] person right that's right right see why
[56:20] why are we
[56:23] dying this physical death is an
[56:25] attribute of the
[56:28] unbelief that's been brought into being
[56:30] into our because of all of us eating off
[56:33] the tree of
[56:36] knowledge see that's why I say we we we
[56:39] today can eat off that tree of knowledge
[56:41] just as well as anybody else no no no
[56:43] brother I'm a
[56:44] Christian all right why would you say
[56:48] the prophet say only Christians have
[56:50] sins right you have to argue with him
[56:52] about some
[56:53] things
[56:55] but see if we accept Satan's
[57:01] life we're dead just like Eve was right
[57:08] right what's the difference in me and
[57:10] you accepting Satan lie or Eve accepting
[57:12] him right come on what's the difference
[57:15] I mean it can't be any difference in it
[57:17] and it's just one
[57:18] lie right
[57:23] amen now surely you would agree with
[57:25] this statement I had rather die
[57:27] naturally than to die spiritually
[57:30] right when you agree with that I had
[57:33] rather die naturally amen that's right
[57:35] than in any way to die spiritually
[57:39] right why because look what spiritual
[57:41] death will do to
[57:43] you all right yep go ahead
[57:47] brother paragraph 137 trying to do God a
[57:50] service without his
[57:52] will look what the prophet has to say
[57:56] many sincere persons go join an
[57:58] organization or a group or a cult of
[58:00] some sort and dare they die
[58:03] spiritually you can't tell them
[58:07] nothing they get that stuff drilled into
[58:10] them why these Bishops said this and
[58:12] this said this this said this you show
[58:15] them right here in the word of God where
[58:17] it's thus sayith the Lord but our pastor
[58:21] I don't care what your pastor says Now
[58:23] read this one don't care what I
[58:27] say y Now read it off the
[58:30] screen he said I don't care what your
[58:32] pastor said don't care what I say or
[58:35] anybody else says if it's contrary to
[58:37] God's Vindicated word of the of the hour
[58:41] the time the message and so forth forget
[58:43] it stay away from it
[58:45] amen that's spiritual death right amen
[58:48] is to take any thought whatsoever right
[58:52] contrary y to God's word
[58:55] Amen to even just to say well in a way
[58:59] that might be
[59:01] right is to take Satan's
[59:04] life right and brings us to spiritual
[59:09] death you say I I can't be in spiritual
[59:12] death brother the de I I'm born
[59:18] again we're going to solve the problem
[59:20] in a
[59:23] minute will to see what the prophet had
[59:26] to say going down to the next one
[59:28] Discerning the body of the
[59:30] Lord page 14 1959
[59:35] 812 let's discern the body of the Lord
[59:38] discern the times that we're living in
[59:41] we'll die spiritually if we don't do
[59:44] that now he could say We'll he you know
[59:47] he didn't say y'all Let's see we got to
[59:50] change that now we got to race up that
[59:52] wheel there and we'll change it to y'all
[59:54] will die spiritually now he says we'll
[59:57] die spiritually if we don't do
[59:59] that and if that is true and the Holy
[1:00:03] Spirit is with us we got the LIF sign of
[1:00:06] the coming of the Lord all right
[1:00:09] now you say what are you trying to get
[1:00:13] to can you
[1:00:18] fall now it order to be a simple matter
[1:00:21] for us to look around at ourselves and
[1:00:22] see we're getting older that's right
[1:00:24] right and there's something causing that
[1:00:26] and it's called spiritual
[1:00:30] dying spiritual
[1:00:34] death to turn down the word of
[1:00:37] God is spiritual
[1:00:40] death and we can do
[1:00:43] that maybe lack of
[1:00:49] understanding maybe to the point
[1:00:53] that we've listened listen to as he said
[1:00:55] the
[1:00:56] Bishops yeah we form
[1:01:00] Cults and
[1:01:04] things and what's wrong with the end
[1:01:06] time
[1:01:07] people spiritually
[1:01:11] dying what keeps taking us
[1:01:15] down turning down the revealed word
[1:01:21] right now remember I brought it his b as
[1:01:24] I could because you can't turn down
[1:01:27] something that you had never heard right
[1:01:30] so don't misunderstand
[1:01:32] me but if you've heard it and turn it
[1:01:36] down I reject it no matter who does the
[1:01:41] preaching would it been all right with
[1:01:43] bam to have rejected what the dumb
[1:01:45] donkey had to
[1:01:47] say not exactly
[1:01:50] right Peter listened to a rooster
[1:01:52] preaching one day
[1:01:55] when he growed three times
[1:01:58] right get your eyes off of what you're
[1:02:01] looking at and get your your ears open
[1:02:03] to the spiritual understanding of God's
[1:02:05] word cuz that's what's killing
[1:02:09] us cuz you know yourself that the mo
[1:02:11] most of the people this message are name
[1:02:13] pre name following preachers in other
[1:02:15] words the big people the ones that's got
[1:02:17] the big names and the and the things
[1:02:19] they can say what they want to and even
[1:02:21] say brother Brandon was wrong yeah even
[1:02:24] say Jesus was
[1:02:28] wrong and like I said the other day see
[1:02:30] then I can sit down in front of you and
[1:02:32] say
[1:02:34] brother do you know that brother so and
[1:02:36] so has said
[1:02:38] that I've heard 15 sermons ain't never
[1:02:42] heard him say
[1:02:46] that well I say name the
[1:02:48] dates well that was the one I listened
[1:02:51] to where he said it right y see we get
[1:02:54] all caught up into the big things
[1:02:57] instead of listening to what said
[1:03:00] right I didn't know faith comes because
[1:03:03] we get so anointed I thought it come
[1:03:05] because of hearing amen
[1:03:08] amen well you don't want me to no I've
[1:03:11] told you I've told you over and over
[1:03:13] here listen to who you want
[1:03:16] to but when that comes back in here that
[1:03:19] I don't agree with I will address it
[1:03:23] because I'm the
[1:03:26] amen but now think about
[1:03:32] it can you
[1:03:34] fall from eternal life
[1:03:41] right can you have eternal life and lose
[1:03:48] it we're not talking about anointed ones
[1:03:50] now we're not talking about anything
[1:03:51] we're talking about genuine bonifide
[1:03:53] Born Again Christ
[1:03:58] Christian look at number
[1:04:02] four paragraph 599 of the Hebrews
[1:04:05] chapter 6 Mark
[1:04:09] 3 said you'll make mistakes you'll fall
[1:04:12] you'll willfully do wrong that's where
[1:04:14] people said no you can't willfully do
[1:04:16] wrong be a Christian well brother Rand
[1:04:18] just said you will do it so you go
[1:04:21] ahead right you go out sometimes and do
[1:04:24] things that don't mean that you're lost
[1:04:25] that means that you're going to get
[1:04:27] correction all right so now he's
[1:04:29] explaining it comes on down to paragraph
[1:04:32] 601 it's impossible for that man to ever
[1:04:35] be gone again that's once been born to
[1:04:38] eternal life God is not an Indian giver
[1:04:41] he that heareth my words and believeth
[1:04:43] on him that sent me has everlasting life
[1:04:45] and shall never come to the Judgment but
[1:04:47] is pass from Death In The Life I'll
[1:04:49] raise him up at the last days that's
[1:04:51] God's promise it's impossible for the
[1:04:54] person to have eternal life and lose it
[1:04:57] you reading it
[1:04:59] right it's impossible to have eternal
[1:05:01] life and lose it because that's right
[1:05:04] God's not an ending Giver now how many
[1:05:07] would you like on that point but that's
[1:05:09] just just to make sure you get it look
[1:05:11] down at the next one baptism of the Holy
[1:05:13] Spirit paragraph 5958 9:28 morning
[1:05:16] service but when a man or a woman has
[1:05:19] been born in the spirit of God all
[1:05:20] things have passed away all things have
[1:05:23] become new he's been birthed and blessed
[1:05:25] by the Eternal God they can no more
[1:05:27] perish than God himself can perish do
[1:05:30] you mean to tell me that a god an
[1:05:32] infinite God would come down and give
[1:05:34] you eternal life knowing that he was
[1:05:36] going to lose you save you here knowing
[1:05:40] he's going to lose you there what did he
[1:05:42] save you for why he's working against
[1:05:46] himself if he saved you once you saved
[1:05:49] for all eternity there's no demons in
[1:05:51] Hell could upset you
[1:05:56] now so we're making
[1:05:58] a
[1:06:01] statement you can't fall from eternal
[1:06:07] life look at the next one here your
[1:06:10] himym paragraph or
[1:06:12] E36 57
[1:06:14] 5198 Ser that when a man is born or a
[1:06:18] son that he's a Son of God that's right
[1:06:20] and God wouldn't save you here knowing
[1:06:22] he was going to lose you there you might
[1:06:24] be worked up and think you're saved here
[1:06:26] that might be true but let me tell you
[1:06:28] something when you're really saved God
[1:06:30] don't save you here and know he's going
[1:06:32] to lose you there if he did he's not the
[1:06:35] infinite God he's defeating his own
[1:06:37] purpose he can't do that if you're saved
[1:06:41] you're saved if you're not you're not
[1:06:43] and if you're saved you live like you're
[1:06:46] saved all
[1:06:48] right
[1:06:50] now so the prophet states that you can't
[1:06:53] fall from etern eternal
[1:06:55] life God's not going to give you eternal
[1:06:57] life and take it back away from you
[1:06:59] right
[1:07:01] no all
[1:07:03] right so what
[1:07:08] happened in the
[1:07:13] garden what took place in the
[1:07:20] garden we're going to come back to that
[1:07:22] first quote in a minute
[1:07:25] did Adam have eternal life amen in his
[1:07:29] soul yes amen
[1:07:32] right all right let's establish that he
[1:07:36] did Blasphemous names paragraph 184 62
[1:07:40] 11:04 the morning
[1:07:44] service you read all of it come on down
[1:07:47] breath the breath is not the soul back
[1:07:48] up to the top let's read all the way
[1:07:50] down brother excuse
[1:07:52] me but now here's je whole witness in
[1:07:54] their book it says that the breath that
[1:07:56] you breathe is the soul now that cannot
[1:07:58] be right the breath that you breathe is
[1:08:00] not the soul if it is you're one time
[1:08:02] one kind of a soul next time you're
[1:08:03] somebody else has breathe that soul look
[1:08:06] where you'd be now the breath is wind
[1:08:09] and wind is what you breathe into your
[1:08:12] nostrils all right now now they take the
[1:08:16] scripture from back and God breathed
[1:08:17] breath into his nostrils and he became a
[1:08:19] living Soul now I want to ask you
[1:08:21] something if he was a man what kind of a
[1:08:22] breath was he breathing before God
[1:08:24] breathed his breath of of life into him
[1:08:26] see what kind of breath he was a
[1:08:28] breathing living man well then if that
[1:08:32] be so then ever animals is living Soul
[1:08:35] because they breathe a human soul and
[1:08:37] our soul and all together then Jesus
[1:08:41] wouldn't have had to Die the animal
[1:08:44] sacrifice would have been sufficient so
[1:08:46] brother the argument don't stand see the
[1:08:49] amoya the African word amoya is like you
[1:08:52] breathe in and breathe out and brother
[1:08:54] Bram I gave it the other day on a
[1:08:56] message where he said if that would be
[1:08:58] true then you wouldn't have to seek the
[1:08:59] Holy Ghost cuz it just come in as your
[1:09:01] breathing it right but that can't be
[1:09:03] true amen amen Theo you the breath you
[1:09:06] breathe is not it it's the soul
[1:09:09] amen listen but what God
[1:09:13] did he breathed the breath of eternal
[1:09:18] life watch it amen then he became a
[1:09:21] living
[1:09:22] Soul a soul that can't die now
[1:09:26] watch we're going to get into honey Plum
[1:09:29] up to Plum to your elbows notice breathe
[1:09:32] a breath of eternal life into his
[1:09:33] nostrils and he became an eternal Soul
[1:09:36] now who's he talking about Adam right
[1:09:38] right cuz God breathed not what nature
[1:09:41] done but what God did breathed the
[1:09:43] breath of life into his nostrils and he
[1:09:45] became a living Soul then you say to me
[1:09:47] Adam died brother random go ahead and R
[1:09:52] brother but but remember before Adam
[1:09:55] died he had a lamb that redeemed him
[1:09:57] Hallelujah those who he forne he has
[1:10:00] called he got he got a lamb to redeem
[1:10:04] them he was a typ Adam fell then the
[1:10:06] lamb was provided for Adam because
[1:10:08] already in his nostrils had become the
[1:10:12] breath of Eternal the Eternal God and he
[1:10:15] became a living Soul he was the son of
[1:10:17] God not his breath as the amoyal word I
[1:10:20] don't know what the Greek word is for
[1:10:21] right now but the African word they call
[1:10:23] it which means to win an unseen Force so
[1:10:27] what Adam had eternal life amen all
[1:10:32] right let's
[1:10:34] see go to paragraph
[1:10:41] 189 then why would we struggle for
[1:10:44] eternal life if that's the Eternal Soul
[1:10:46] breathed into us by the breath why would
[1:10:48] we struggle for eternal life it
[1:10:49] backfires brother see it it it just
[1:10:52] can't do it but God espcially upon Adam
[1:10:56] breathed the breath of eternal life and
[1:10:58] he became an eternal person with God he
[1:11:01] had power of God he was an amateure God
[1:11:03] he was God of the earth not God Of
[1:11:06] Heaven now God of the Earth right all
[1:11:09] right so Adam had eternal life amen in
[1:11:14] his soul amen
[1:11:16] right okay that's right
[1:11:21] now then that looks like it's
[1:11:25] contrary
[1:11:27] to what we read in the
[1:11:31] beginning because we what we read in the
[1:11:38] beginning it looked like Adam had
[1:11:41] it and fell from it
[1:11:44] right let's read a couple more then
[1:11:46] we'll back up to that look at number
[1:11:49] seven let's see women now we already
[1:11:51] pass that U
[1:11:54] let me get my notes
[1:11:56] together number
[1:11:58] eight let's see what happened in the
[1:12:01] garden that's right let's read what
[1:12:04] happened really in the garden cuz this
[1:12:05] is taken for the breach uh you know the
[1:12:08] seal book 1963 317 paragraph
[1:12:14] 102 see Adam lost his
[1:12:17] inheritance yep the Earth that's right
[1:12:21] what was Adam's inheritance the Earth
[1:12:24] okay now it passed from his hand to the
[1:12:27] one he sold out to Satan he sold his
[1:12:31] faith in God to Satan's reason therefore
[1:12:33] his eternal
[1:12:34] life his right to the Tree of Life his
[1:12:39] right to the Earth to the Earth belong
[1:12:42] to him and he forfeited to every every
[1:12:44] bit to the hands of Satan he pasted it
[1:12:47] from his hands now you know what it may
[1:12:49] be on the next quote but you know what
[1:12:50] brother R said it couldn't go back to
[1:12:52] Satan he said went back to God right
[1:12:54] okay keep keep on reading look at
[1:12:58] paragraph
[1:12:59] 116 now for now the forfeited title deed
[1:13:02] is now in the hands of the original
[1:13:04] owner see now the there where he comes
[1:13:05] back up almighty God the title deed to
[1:13:08] the Earth see that's why you can read
[1:13:09] one quote make brother around say
[1:13:10] anything you want
[1:13:12] to but keep on reading to see what he
[1:13:15] say now the for title deed is now in the
[1:13:18] hands of the original owner almighty God
[1:13:20] the title deed to the Earth and to
[1:13:21] eternal life when Adam forfeited it then
[1:13:24] Satan's dirty hands could not take it so
[1:13:27] it went back to its original owner God
[1:13:29] himself we're going to find it just in
[1:13:30] the money so we drop down and you keep
[1:13:33] reading about the abstract title de to
[1:13:35] eternal life when Adam forfeited it for
[1:13:37] wisdom and instead of faith it went back
[1:13:40] to the hands of the
[1:13:43] owner paragraph
[1:13:47] 123 same breach
[1:13:50] message God's law required an instant
[1:13:52] substitute itute and who was innocent
[1:13:55] every man had been born bisexual after
[1:13:58] sex everyone the only one that wasn't
[1:14:01] was he talking about Adam right had
[1:14:02] forfeited the rights to eternal
[1:14:05] life and to be king of the
[1:14:09] earth so what
[1:14:12] happened in the
[1:14:16] garden what is
[1:14:22] death to turn down the revealed word of
[1:14:25] God
[1:14:28] Amen I don't ask you to agree with me
[1:14:30] because especially for the next few
[1:14:32] minutes I would just sit and
[1:14:36] listen I'm just
[1:14:39] honest cuz I got something to say to
[1:14:42] you if you don't agree with me then
[1:14:45] we'll talk later about it that's all
[1:14:47] right I'm just trying to make a
[1:14:52] point
[1:14:53] we've read it look
[1:14:56] like we've read that Adam had eternal
[1:14:59] life in his soul that's right we're not
[1:15:01] talking about Body Spirit or anything
[1:15:03] we're talking about his
[1:15:04] soul we proved that all
[1:15:08] right we prove
[1:15:11] that Adam
[1:15:14] lost something in the
[1:15:17] garden the rulership of the
[1:15:19] earth and the right to eternal life
[1:15:26] we proved
[1:15:27] that you
[1:15:30] cannot lose eternal life right
[1:15:36] right cuz God's not an ending
[1:15:40] Giver
[1:15:43] okay so what took place in the
[1:15:48] garden this is I said it and I'll go
[1:15:51] ahead and make it because I got it WR on
[1:15:52] my notes so I believe that you and I can
[1:15:55] fall
[1:15:56] tonight just like Adam and Eve
[1:16:02] fell I believe we are
[1:16:08] falling we're falling every
[1:16:10] moment just like Adam and Eve
[1:16:15] fell now how did Adam and Eve
[1:16:19] fall
[1:16:22] right
[1:16:25] what took place in the
[1:16:29] garden that is still taking place
[1:16:36] today you say Brother D are you talking
[1:16:38] about Christians Born Again Christians
[1:16:41] right
[1:16:44] right I believe us as Born Again
[1:16:47] Christians are still falling just like
[1:16:49] Adam and Eve fell right right
[1:16:55] I'll take a little explaining on
[1:17:01] there what happened to Adam and Eve in
[1:17:03] the
[1:17:06] garden Brother Anderson go back to
[1:17:08] number one on your
[1:17:13] notes the breach paragraph
[1:17:16] 9091 through
[1:17:18] 93 he didn't know he was going to do it
[1:17:20] this
[1:17:22] way I wanted him to be thanking
[1:17:25] also as well as anyone but all of
[1:17:28] us so let's read what the prophet had to
[1:17:36] say that when a person is struck you can
[1:17:38] read
[1:17:41] it by sin and then we're
[1:17:45] groaning we're groaning
[1:17:48] now right many sick among us I forgot to
[1:17:53] tell it too uh you know my uh white
[1:17:57] blood Camp I forgot to announce it
[1:17:58] Sunday you know my white blood Camp back
[1:18:01] when I was having the temperature and
[1:18:02] all of the sickness with the sinuses and
[1:18:04] thing it it jumped from 17 to
[1:18:07] 40 and they got worried about
[1:18:11] it I just kept saying well I'm Healed it
[1:18:14] don't make no
[1:18:15] difference
[1:18:16] well we finally went back and they said
[1:18:19] well it's dropped from
[1:18:21] 40 now remember I I stated it cuz I'm
[1:18:23] sure it was not it was on 17 the blood
[1:18:26] count white blood count and it went
[1:18:29] excuse me 22 now why I saying 22 cuz I
[1:18:32] think it was may have been 22 I know
[1:18:34] that it was right in there all right it
[1:18:36] went up to
[1:18:38] 40 the next test they run it was down to
[1:18:40] 29 the doctor says well great said it's
[1:18:42] on its way
[1:18:44] down normal is from 4 to
[1:18:48] 10 that right sah she's taking her head
[1:18:51] she's a nurse we got T
[1:18:56] so they kept saying well okay let's run
[1:18:57] some more tests and
[1:19:00] see it dropped down to
[1:19:02] 29
[1:19:05] and went back up and I said sit there in
[1:19:09] the office and I said Lord just let the
[1:19:10] thing drop on down to where it'll prove
[1:19:12] what's going on now remember it started
[1:19:15] at
[1:19:18] 22 they ran their test and it was on 14
[1:19:21] amen
[1:19:27] he went down lower than it was to start
[1:19:30] with amen he's still in the healing
[1:19:34] business you think I'm worried about
[1:19:36] what
[1:19:39] no but now listen we're all grown in
[1:19:43] sickness among us what we know we know
[1:19:45] we've fallen from somewhere right right
[1:19:49] right Adam and Eve in the garden the
[1:19:52] prophet said said that their youth was
[1:19:53] being renewed
[1:19:56] daily all right amen now which meant
[1:20:01] Adam was not Eternal in body
[1:20:05] right he was only Eternal in his soul
[1:20:09] right amen he was not Eternal in his
[1:20:12] body right right his youth was being
[1:20:15] renewed
[1:20:17] daily evidently he must have not have
[1:20:19] been Eternal in
[1:20:21] spirit
[1:20:23] because after all that was said and done
[1:20:26] he sold the human race y That's
[1:20:32] right yep and he was a child of God
[1:20:34] remember amen the first son that's right
[1:20:38] the Bible says and Adam all die we read
[1:20:40] well ago
[1:20:42] right that's
[1:20:44] right so Adam and body he was not
[1:20:49] Eternal in spirit he was not eternal in
[1:20:53] his soul he was eternal
[1:20:57] right now go down to paragraph
[1:21:03] 91 now we don't need anybody to
[1:21:06] interpret that for
[1:21:07] us we know it was eternal life they'
[1:21:10] fallen
[1:21:13] from now brother
[1:21:16] Brandon they lost their claims on
[1:21:19] eternal life by the fall of Adam and Eve
[1:21:21] which means all of us who fell from
[1:21:23] eternal life to death in the Garden of
[1:21:27] Eden and brought all nature unto them to
[1:21:30] death right
[1:21:33] now how can you fall from eternal
[1:21:37] life I had just tried person tried to
[1:21:40] explain that to me one time said that
[1:21:42] was just
[1:21:45] Adam
[1:21:47] well you can take that point if you want
[1:21:50] to and go
[1:21:51] ahead
[1:21:55] but where does that put
[1:21:59] you I say church that we are doing the
[1:22:02] same thing today that Adam and Eve done
[1:22:05] in the
[1:22:07] garden we're
[1:22:16] dying I'll let you
[1:22:21] think
[1:22:23] what is brother randam saying when he's
[1:22:25] already said you can't fall from eternal
[1:22:27] life
[1:22:29] right if you're saved you're saved
[1:22:33] amen what's he saying
[1:22:36] now what happened to Adam and Eve in the
[1:22:39] garden and you'll see that the same
[1:22:42] things taking place right here
[1:22:45] today Adam never lost eternal life in
[1:22:47] his soul that's
[1:22:51] right he lost the right to the tree of
[1:22:56] life right
[1:22:58] amen you agree amen no matter what else
[1:23:01] You' agree with in the message you would
[1:23:02] agree with that he lost a right to the
[1:23:05] tree of life
[1:23:09] amen because his body was not
[1:23:12] Eternal right amen right so he fell from
[1:23:16] that body come into a position of
[1:23:19] Eternity
[1:23:21] right are you
[1:23:23] he fell from the position that he should
[1:23:26] have reached right had he stayed with
[1:23:30] the word the tree of life was standing
[1:23:34] there they could have eventually partook
[1:23:37] of the tree of life right but once they
[1:23:40] had fallen in their unbelief and brought
[1:23:42] death into their beings of natural God
[1:23:46] had to put them out cuz he said we got
[1:23:48] to get them out here because not they
[1:23:50] will partake of the tree of life and
[1:23:52] live will watch
[1:23:56] forever cuz you can't have an eternal
[1:23:58] sinner right the Bible doesn't say that
[1:24:02] read your Bible it says we got to put
[1:24:04] them out unless they partake of the tree
[1:24:06] of life and live forever right
[1:24:09] amen cuz had they been able to got to
[1:24:11] that tree of life they could have lived
[1:24:13] forever but they couldn't lived
[1:24:15] eternally right
[1:24:17] no not a difference in eternity and
[1:24:19] forever that's right amen see Adam and
[1:24:24] Eve fell from a
[1:24:27] position of rulership of the Earth
[1:24:31] right and the right to partake of that
[1:24:34] tree of life and come to eternal life in
[1:24:36] Body Spirit and soul right but they had
[1:24:40] eternal life in their
[1:24:44] soul they never lost eternal life in
[1:24:47] their soul that's right and neither was
[1:24:49] I saying what you might have thought I
[1:24:52] was saying when I asked the question can
[1:24:54] we fall the same way you cannot have
[1:24:58] eternal life and lose it right that's
[1:25:03] right there is no way
[1:25:08] right you can't have eternal life in
[1:25:10] your soul and lose eternal life in your
[1:25:12] soul you can't have it no amen Adam
[1:25:17] never lost his eternal life in his
[1:25:20] soul he lost the right to the tree of
[1:25:23] life that would have given him eternity
[1:25:26] in All Phases and would have finally
[1:25:28] brought the world to eternal
[1:25:31] life that's right all right right now
[1:25:34] we're back word that most of you know
[1:25:35] that I preached over the
[1:25:37] years that
[1:25:40] Adam
[1:25:43] lost coming to eternal life it was right
[1:25:47] there
[1:25:49] right come on if the tree of knowledge
[1:25:51] was there and the Tree of Life was there
[1:25:53] then the tree of life was right there
[1:25:54] for them to to partake of right Y and
[1:25:57] I've told you my definition you can do
[1:25:59] what you want to you think what you want
[1:26:00] do about it but had sin not entered the
[1:26:03] picture now are you listening to my
[1:26:05] statement had sin not come to to p
[1:26:09] through Adam and
[1:26:10] Eve then God would have allowed them to
[1:26:13] spoke us into existence and the g the
[1:26:16] Genesis 1:26 and 27 people which would
[1:26:19] be the children of God would have walked
[1:26:20] right out there in human bodies right
[1:26:23] with eternal Souls right cuz God would
[1:26:27] have breathed into our nostrils the
[1:26:28] breath of eternal life had they not been
[1:26:30] a
[1:26:31] fall and then we could have all went to
[1:26:33] the tree of life
[1:26:36] right and our bodies would have made
[1:26:38] been made Eternal then for our bodies to
[1:26:40] be made Eternal the world and all things
[1:26:42] would have been made Eternal but that
[1:26:44] didn't happen right but what's the
[1:26:47] difference in what happened right
[1:26:51] amen
[1:26:52] is it not true that you receive eternal
[1:26:54] life by accepting Jesus Christ as your
[1:26:56] savior amen that gives you eternal life
[1:26:59] in your soul but that don't make your
[1:27:01] body and your spirit Eternal and are we
[1:27:03] not going to the tree of life which is
[1:27:05] the word of God are we not eating of
[1:27:09] this every day as we read it or are you
[1:27:11] reading gre's
[1:27:13] Almanac you won't find this in gre's ALC
[1:27:16] I used to say that in Jamaica and they
[1:27:17] couldn't figure it out cuz they got a
[1:27:18] McDonald's alac They don't have a
[1:27:21] GRE way that interpret tell them what
[1:27:25] I'm
[1:27:26] saying but
[1:27:29] listen this is my final statements of
[1:27:32] what I'm talking
[1:27:34] about see you and I have eternal life in
[1:27:37] our soul right by the new birth you
[1:27:40] agree amen yes sir all right making you
[1:27:43] a child of
[1:27:44] God you cannot be lost
[1:27:48] right but now if we don't partake of the
[1:27:51] tree of life which is the word of
[1:27:57] God you know what's going to happen
[1:28:00] right we're going by the grave
[1:28:03] right wasn't that exactly what have
[1:28:05] happened to Adam and Eve right didn't
[1:28:08] not Adam and Eve go by the grave that's
[1:28:10] right
[1:28:11] Amen brother Brandon said one of these
[1:28:14] days Adam will raise up and reach over
[1:28:17] and catch Eve and eveil raise and she'll
[1:28:19] catch able Seth and the L come up and
[1:28:22] right up through it'll go
[1:28:25] right why because Adam never lost
[1:28:27] eternal life in his soul that's right he
[1:28:30] lost a right to come he forfeited there
[1:28:34] over in there we talking about he
[1:28:36] forfeited his right right yeah he

[1:31:13] Angels Amen to suffer in honor and
[1:31:17] Glory are you listening to what I
[1:31:19] said then I believe
[1:31:22] that you and I can fall just like Adam
[1:31:26] and Eve fell and I just proved my point
[1:31:29] of what I was talking about whether you
[1:31:30] would believe it or not but they never
[1:31:32] lost eternal
[1:31:34] life they only lost a right to the tree
[1:31:37] of life and the the the living upon the
[1:31:39] Earth in an eternal being right and
[1:31:42] that's what we're
[1:31:43] doing yep right instead of believing who
[1:31:46] we are and what God has said we are
[1:31:48] instead of taking what he says about us

[1:34:28] line we're falling from eternal life

[1:34:36] right
[1:34:41] right you know yourself that what I'm
[1:34:43] telling you is the
[1:34:46] truth people can take their human mind
[1:34:49] soul being and bend metal crack glass do
[1:34:53] all kind of thing walk on colds of
[1:35:02] fire ask these are sitting here about
[1:35:04] their
[1:35:05] karate that they taught them to bypass
[1:35:07] the human mind and they can break a
[1:35:10] block but you look at the Block and you
[1:35:13] can't break it it'll break your
[1:35:18] fist come on we're accepting death what
[1:35:21] we're doing doing oh I just don't feel

[1:35:26] like it I thought the church was Place
[1:35:28] supposed to be at when we sick right I
[1:35:30] mean I don't understand it I'm just
[1:35:31] honest now right I thought that's where
[1:35:33] we're supposed to be when we're sick y
[1:35:35] That's
[1:35:37] right well no no no no we don't we don't
[1:35:39] need them here because they might have a
[1:35:42] disease I have finally broke down on my
[1:35:44] car I never would State make this
[1:35:47] statement till now if you got some
[1:35:49] disease that somebody else can catch go
[1:35:51] to the
[1:35:52] basement and we'll get some of us that
[1:35:54] are believe enough and come down and
[1:35:56] pray with you but don't stay at home
[1:35:58] yeah well I don't want nobody else to
[1:35:59] get you're using the excuse
[1:36:05] right y they finally brought a little
[1:36:07] bottle up here cuz I know what some
[1:36:10] people's minds
[1:36:14] are some people's minds that they don't
[1:36:16] like for me to break bread when I'm
[1:36:18] coughing and holding my hand up and
[1:36:20] going

[1:36:28] pray for 90% of you never put oil on I
[1:36:31] don't care oil in my pocket that's right
[1:36:35] come on I'm not against that I know what
[1:36:36] the prophet is said I know what the
[1:36:38] Bible said that oil is supposed to
[1:36:39] protect you right but if that Holy Ghost
[1:36:41] inside of me can't protect me then
[1:36:43] there's something wrong with the Holy
[1:36:44] Ghost inside of me you mean I'm afraid
[1:36:46] to go in a room where somebody's
[1:36:48] sick don't you go in there now you'll

[1:37:20] about it we are failing to start with
[1:37:22] right we're born
[1:37:25] failures so that's why I said Adam and
[1:37:28] Eve never lost eternal life in their
[1:37:30] soul they lost the right to come to the
[1:37:32] body being changed and made Eternal and
[1:37:34] ownership of the earth that's exactly
[1:37:36] what you and I are doing right now right

[1:40:48] tonight I ask you twice to go and listen
[1:40:51] to the
[1:40:53] T you said but Brother D I heard you say
[1:40:56] it I've had people to tell me that I've
[1:40:59] had people tell me right it was you said
[1:41:02] so and so I said well we'll just get to
[1:41:03] table and
[1:41:06] see because that's what your mind was
[1:41:08] set on when you heard it you heard what
[1:41:10] you wanted to hear you didn't hear what
[1:41:12] I
[1:41:13] said I said Adam and Eve never fail from
[1:41:16] eternal life in their soul but they fail
[1:41:18] from coming to eternal life
[1:41:22] right and that's exactly what you and I
[1:41:25] are
[1:41:28] doing we have eternal life in our soul
[1:41:30] and we're going to go by the grave if we
[1:41:32] don't stand up and say this is the word
[1:41:34] and this is it we're going by the grave
[1:41:37] I said that how many years ago 30
[1:41:41] 40 I stood right here and
[1:41:44] said that there'll be a lot of people
[1:41:46] die that's in this message and not to go
[1:41:48] by the grave I said cuz it won be able
[1:41:51] to stand there for that change I may be
[1:41:53] one of them but I said it and I believe
[1:41:55] it right that's been 30 something years
[1:41:59] ago because I saw that what we're doing
[1:42:02] death is any
[1:42:05] interpretation that I have that is not
[1:42:08] exactly with this
[1:42:09] word right that's
[1:42:12] death any thought I have all right
[1:42:15] where's your women
[1:42:16] preachers yeah just one point where are
[1:42:19] they at
[1:42:22] brother Brown said I'm not going to tell
[1:42:23] you that God didn't call you I'm just
[1:42:25] going to tell you it's not in the
[1:42:28] word that's right cuz you can't tell
[1:42:31] them that's and North not brother said
[1:42:33] that's why you can't tell them women
[1:42:34] it's wrong to do that he said because
[1:42:36] they are anointed with the Holy Spirit y
[1:42:40] on their spirit and will not
[1:42:44] listen right that's death
[1:42:48] folks that's death to be Anointed with
[1:42:50] the Holy Spirit and won't believe the
[1:42:52] truth go ahead brother what we 41 INSP
