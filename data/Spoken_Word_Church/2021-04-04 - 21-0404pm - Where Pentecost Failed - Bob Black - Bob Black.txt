resurrection sunday uh how many enjoyed that message this morning that we that we heard that was uh i mean i told brother dale this morning uh he uh i'm actually gonna preach on the exact same scripture and uh y'all might hear an echo this afternoon but i told him uh he didn't leave me anything to preach he just covered it so but anyway um you know this time of year i always kind of like to think about you know this is april 4th of course it's my birthday and but you know brother brown when he was covering the seals and and daniel's 70 weeks and all he he kind of he thank god for a prophet because he was able to just kind of expose some things that you know i don't think anybody else in the world is aware of like what exactly happened on this day now we know jesus rose from the grave on sunday and that's why we we come to church on sunday is because he rose from the grave on this day but on april 4th 18 30 you know brother ram said on april 2nd he rode into jerusalem on that on the little donkey and and then on april 4th they went down to the temple and and then they uh uh his disciples started asking him some questions and they went over to the mount of olives and they sat down on the mount of olives and he preached matthew chapter 24 where he started talking about the seals and all those kind of things and so we just thank god for profit we've we've heard uh not not a message not from just some man or some man's ideas but we've actually heard direct from god that you've even be able to pinpoint exactly what happened on this day so maybe you don't want to drive home tonight or or you know just when you're pondering and thinking reflect back on on what actually happened on on this day so many thousands of years ago and now all all you know everything that we believe and everything that we that that we've heard the brother brown preach and all the seven church ages all came from the ministry of that one man jesus christ who preached for three and a half years and it all came from what he did so i let's go to ephesians chapter one verses one to seven and i'm gonna um preach uh maybe a strange topic for easter sunday um where pentecost failed and just uh really try to break down a message that brother brown preached yeah i think in 1955 where he said he called it where i think pentecost failed i think we can say with definitive definitely after we maybe study through this where pentecost failed and maybe by god's grace by the end of this afternoon you'll be able to answer the question with confidence where did pentecost fail let's go to the lord in prayer before we go to the word lord we we thank you so much for your grace and mercy to us to be able to gather in the house of god and to be able to look into your word lord jesus and lord we can look into the word the lord but we need the author to come and show us what it really means lord and i pray god that you'll come and lord let my god my tongue lord jesus god in my mouth to speak the truth lord jesus and open up the ears of the hearers lord jesus lord that lord that the truth will be quickened to them lord jesus that it won't just be confusing words lord but let it be a certain sound lord that nobody would leave wondering what was said and wondering what was done and wonder what we're here for but leave lord god knowing for certain that they heard from you that something was said that would be edifying to them lord god well i ask this lord this blessing upon your people lord jesus and be with brother wade and be with all the other ones around the world lord jesus that are coming together on this day lord jesus that is special to your bride and christians all around the world we ask this blessing as we read your word in the name of the lord jesus christ amen also somebody somebody reminded me um i think last week that that this was the day that that brother dick passed away about it it's been a year now so if sister gayle is listening in i just want to say we love you and we and we miss you and and we're praying for you constantly you think about that too you know brother dicks if we were to pass away brother dick be waiting there on the other side ready to greet us you know think about how brother branham said that that when you when you pass away it's just like just uh from from them passing away to coming up from the ground is just going to be like a blink of an eye to them and they they're not not even hardly any time passed so if we were to go over the uh you know pass away brother dick will be right there to greet us and and uh my what a blessing that is that god how god has arranged everything just so perfect so it's just perfect for our for our joy and our comfort and our happiness all right let's read ephesians chapter 1 verses 1 to 7 says paul and apostle to jesus christ by the will of god to the saints which are at ephesus and to the faithful in christ jesus grace be to you and peace from god our father and from the lord jesus christ blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace you may be seated the lord bless his word now this is um you know i believe that as time goes on and as you as you grow and grace and knowledge that the lord is actually holding your testimony and honing holding your ability to speak correctly and accurately in a way that is is is less confusing and i believe that's what god has been doing in the bride around the world is is taking things that originally you know if you ever think that that you don't have any questions about the message just get to reading the message for a little bit and you'll find that there's a lot of things in the message that that are very perplexing or very very strange almost and some of the things that brother branham says it it takes a while for you know it really takes the leading of the holy spirit to correctly place things and so this topic where pentecost failed is maybe maybe one of the most controversial things that i i just in my in my own personal journey i've heard many people try to preach it and cause a lot of confusion because people try to speak on it cause a lot of confusion where where pentecost failed and and and so i i just pray that this morning the lord will just open it up and and give me uh uh give me uh the ability to articulate things in a way that won't be confusion i think a lot of the confusion comes from when you start talking about pentecost failing or something failing then people's minds immediately go to well you don't believe in the baptism in the holy ghost you don't believe in in god actually coming down in the with the pillar of fire or coming down and quickly the word to you coming down and revealing himself in a personal way and that is not what we're talking about so i want to first kind of make the statement to that that we absolutely we believe that the the holy ghost is still quickening the word the same way he did in the book of acts in acts 2 38 and there in the house of cornelius he's still coming and he's still able to quicken the word so he's still he's still moving in the hearts and lives of the believer he's still moving he's still able to reveal himself but you see it's important to understand where pentecost fell because brother branham if you go back and read this message go back i would encourage you to go back and read where i think pentecost failed he said the reason why we need to understand where pentecost failed is so that we don't fail now brother braham he said i'm going to read this quote he said i'm only trying to point out these facts facts and facts facts is something that you just put out there and and you got to deal with it and a lot of times we don't like facts but you put a fact out there and it's a fact we got to deal with it we got to figure out what what it means and what it means for us and he says i'm only trying to point out these facts that we might know where if we know where we made a mistake then the best thing to do is go right back there and start anew again come right over we know that something's happened and so if we know where it failed we will not fail and so maybe that's my subtitle of this message is where pentecost failed and you so you will not now you have to make the decision whether or not you're going to be in that group of those that will not fail or not that's up to you but i i want to i really want to preach a positive message this afternoon a positive message not not trying to beat people up or anything but just an encouraging message because you look at you look at where pentecost failed and it's almost like looking at like a shipwreck along the way you look at people's lives that brother i'm talking about people that fall away to the wayside people make mistakes and they're on the on the wayside and some you can look at that and and learn a lesson from it learn a lesson and avoid the same pitfall that they went into the same pitfall that they ran into so we believe we believe in the power of the holy ghost we believe in that same baptism of the holy ghost that fell on the day of pentecost and we believe that the power the baptism in the holy ghost has a purpose and it's to give unction to the book to the preacher like brother i'm preaching what was the holy ghost given for it's to give holiness to the group is to set the church in order it's to bring a unity of spirit it's to unite us together with power is to unite us together with love brotherly love and and you can see when the holy ghost does something in somebody's life it actually has an effect the power of the holy ghost like like jesus telling nicodemus he said the wind bloweth where it lifts us and now hears the sound there of but can't not tell what's it coming you can you don't know where it came from but you can tell when it was there you can see it rustling in the trees you can see it blowing across the lake you can tell the effects and you can see the effects of the holy ghost in somebody's life when the holy ghost comes and quickens the word that they've heard it will change that person it will cause something to happen in that person's life that is unmistakable so we believe in the power of the holy ghost we believe in the holy we believe in the original pentecostal experience and brother brown said he said and where i think pentecost failed he said oh my he began to talk about hunting and comparing isn't that interesting that he compared honey with the holy ghost and honey with the brotherly kindness when you get up the statue of a perfect man honey honey when you get up with all around believers that are filled with the holy ghost it's like honey and you begin to you begin to just like like those little bears that he told the story about you begin to lick the honey off of one another it's like you just get around one another and you feel that same joy because the holy ghost has an effect the holy ghost is is there to actually produce the life of christ in somebody and and brother ryan said there's no condemnation to them that's licking honey when you get around people that it's just like honey rolling off everything there's love and joy and peace and you love one another and it don't matter maybe if people throw in little barbs and make poking a little fun every now and then because there's love there there's holy ghost the holy ghost love the holy ghost is in the camp you see and program said you always see that when you camera you know he's talking about little bears and he says and that's what i mean when we get our hands in a honey jar you know just no condemnation just keep licking honey and have a good time now you might think that's just a little story brother brown threw in at the beginning of the sermon but as he gets down into this sermon where pentecost failed that has has an implication brother ram doesn't just tell stories just to tell stories but it has something to do with the point that he's trying to make the lesson that he's trying to bring and he begins he goes on and he says you were saved 1900 years ago when jesus died at calvary you accepted it two years ago or 10 years ago see there's where the sin question was settled before god's requirement was made the total price was paid in full at calvary and now from all the redemptive blessings that jesus died for is every one of your personal property you believers the only thing you have to do is just believe it accept it and call it yours now what he's saying is now you've got the holy ghost you have a right to every redemptive blessing that jesus died on on this easter morning for you to accept all you have to do is believe and accept it he said when a man is born again of the spirit of god god gives him a checkbook that'll last him all through life's journey oh my now he's starting to get into a problem there a problem area with the pentecostals so let's listen and see what he says and at the bottom of each check has got jesus's name written assigned to it and you just fill it out for any redemptive blessing you just fill it out it's already signed with his name but you got to sign your name to it in other words you got to say i believe it i accept it there's a check a check that you have access to when you're born again that you have access to every redemptive blessing and he said now surely surely you're not afraid then it won't be cash surely you're not afraid that it won't be cash if you're afraid you just hold the book in your pocket now if you've got a checkbook that gives you access to every redemptive blessing of god but you don't have faith that there's money in the bank to feel that check you'll keep that check in your pocket now see that's what brother he begins to talk about he said i found two classes of people and that is the fundamentalist and the pentecost pentecostals and one one has money in the bank in other words they've got the teaching they've got the background they've got they know what they have access to but they just don't have faith to put it out there and write a check they don't have faith for to just to make to put it into action but the other has a checkbook and they have they got faith for what the little bit they know but they don't have all the background and brother and said now if you can put those two together i believe that's what brother branham was doing through his whole ministry is trying to put those two together trying to get the people that can just step out on faith give them a little background give them a little knowledge give them a little teaching so that they know what they believe you see we're not trying to get away from pentecostal at pentecost to the actual moving of the holy ghost but what we're trying to do brother branham is trying to give that background the teaching that's why you need teaching he said if you can get a pentecostal to realize who they are and what that means is if you can get a real pinnacle a pentecostal that's been born again with this genuine baptism by the holy ghost and get them to realize by the teaching of the word by the opening of the word that they have a higher place of authority than even an angel if an angel of god was standing right here in this place you as a child of god because you are connected of god you are the actual manifestation of god in this earth you have a higher position of authority than even an angel and that's why paul with confidence could say if an angel were standing here and preaching any other thing than what i have already preached that letting me accursed i believe that the bride is coming to the same position the same position of power and authority to know that what she believes is correct to know that what she has a correct understanding she knows what god wants she knows what he wants wrong with his word and see god is bringing those two classes of people together and that's why in this message she'll say we we need to love one another we need to love one another because when the pentecostals and the fundamentals don't like one another and they don't want to be around one another they got something that both can contribute after you get them together get the teaching and get the dynamics and the power get it together then you've got something now brother i believe that's why he said that's why he said i'm jumping around in my my quotes here i believe that's why he said it it is the rising of the sun it is the rising of the sun that he said there has been churches churches brides brides churches brides but there has got to come one there's got to come one what a one bride that has got the teaching and the dynamics together that has got the fundamentals and the pentecostal that they're not afraid to scream in church when something happens but they know what they're screaming about they're not afraid to run down the aisle if something happens but they know what they're running about that it's not running about for some for some kind of silly sensation or something but they're running because god has revealed himself to them brother adam said there has got to come a real bride there must come one that's not only got the mechanics but the dynamics of it makes that church live move in the power of his resurrection there you'll see something when you got that kind of a church that kind of a bride that's got the background that's got that she knows what she has access to in the bank that she knows the benefits that she can draw from and then has the faith and the confidence to write the check write her name next to jesus christ on that checkbook something's got to happen listen that's when you're going to see the dead rise from the ground that's when you're going to see a people walk in the power of the demonstration of the holy ghost with signs following fulfilling exactly what god has promised in his word brother brown said so if you could ever get real good fundamental faith amongst pentecostal people or fundamental doctrine with the pentecostal people or vice versa i'd like to see what the meeting would be when the people realize that you are not you will be you are present tense right now sons and daughters of god and not just that you are sons of daughters of god but what that means what that means as god has put his power and his life and his characteristics in you and has molded you by the word has placed you by the word and put you positionally to a place of adoption he said you're pushing it way off out to the millennium somewhere all the blessings out of the millennium why it's right now we don't need divine healing in the millennium now is when we have it we won't be sons of god but now your sons of god and heirs join heirs with jesus and everything that jesus died for at calvary is your possession brother braham said brother satan don't like that because if the people would only realize and just be willing to take god at his word you would you just he said well it's unlimited why is it unlimited because god is unlimited the power of god is unlimited if you write the checkbook whatever you say whatever you say you can have access for you can have access if you need salvation for your family then speak it do you know that's what brother branham said the commission to the church was speak and go forward and you've been commissioned by god himself to speak and go forward not to hold back not to speak and go backwards but to go speak and go forward that's actually what your commission is your commission is to speak his word and go forward one step one step speak and keep moving and you'll see that's where pentecost failed brother brahm said and god perfecting his church he says now but the fundamentalist doesn't have any faith to operate what they believe they are the pentecostals has it but don't know who they are that's it and look it's just like a man who has a lot of money in the bank but he can't write a check the other man can write a check and ain't got no money in the bank if i could ever get them together brother the millennium would start if i could ever get those two together i believe that it's got to happen it's got to happen god that is that's that level of predestination that you don't even have nothing to do with there is going to be a bride where those two have come together fundamental and pentecostalism a church that knows what she stands for and believes it and is able to write that check brother brown said why this old nation would see something shaken like it never seen before signs and wonders would appear from everywhere if you could ever get fundamental faith and pentecostal people or a pentecostal faith and fundamental people the pentecostals has received the baptism of the holy ghost and that makes them a part fellowship and relationship with god that's born again and a son and daughter of god tell them out of the bible and they'll believe it but the thing of it is they forgot who they are why because they don't have that background they don't have the fundamental teaching that many times they're running around shouting for what they do not what but that doesn't mean that running around and shouting is wrong but if you can get the two together then you'll have what's right so many times we'll knock down somebody that's shouting and receiving a blessing from god and will say that's wrong it's not wrong you need to combine the two together and then you'll have what god wants there to be [Applause] i lost my place here the pentecostals has received the baptismal again he said they think they think he said they think well i don't know i don't know brother and sister god don't want you to think i don't know he wants you to know he wants you to know beyond a shadow of a doubt whether this message is right whether the baptism in the holy ghost is real whether the gospel is true whether it really will change you and when you know you're that's what's coming together you see he said oh brother you that's born again our sons and daughters of god co-equal with jesus christ and his presence oh my that's what makes the devil angry is let the church of god realize who they are when you get a church that is able to write the checkbook and knows who they are and knows the authority that they have and that they have access to the bank account and there ain't going to be no overdrawn funds you're going to have a church that will be an invincible army you see that's what the message is the message is really not so much closed hair and dress although that starts off it starts off maybe close hair and dress but the message the message is a revelation of a full bank account right and faith to access it that's what the revealing of god's word does it gives you an understanding of what you have access to a full bank account access to all of god's word and faith to access it and you've got brother and i said you've got faith you've got faith if you're born again everybody's got faith if they're born again but you got to know what you have access to to really use that faith you got to know what you've got access to brother said when you receive the holy ghost everything you've got in need of between hearing glory is right in you then it ain't listen to how he says it he said it ain't faith that you need it ain't faith that you need because you've already got it exactly he said you've got faith if you got the holy spirit for he is your faith isn't that what happens when you get born again you struggle with your own faith until he comes and accepts that faith and gives you his faith and then you've got something to believe with that's why paul said the life i live up now i live by the faith of the son of god because it's his faith living inside of you and that's why brother brown said he is your faith he's the one doing the believing on the inside if you if you're born again if you've got the new birth if you've got his life on the inside he's the one doing the believing so you don't need faith you've already got it what you need though you need teaching to tell you what you've got access to brother brown said the thing you have to know is know how to use that faith excuse me and brother brown he goes on he says there's two things that we have to watch closely one of them is an intellectual religion intellectual faith up in your head and the other one is a real born-again experience one of them is a head and the other one is in the heart and the bible says as a man thinketh in his heart so is he which seems real strange because you would think that you would think in your head but a christian is actually thinking from their heart you you're you're not using all the intellectual stuff the way that a sinner does you're not using your brain you're thinking from your heart and that's why a believer the christian experience is is love and joy and peace and long suffering and all those things coming from my heart coming from a rooted in faith an experience rooted in faith brother and i said not because you can be orthodox because you can explain your religion that isn't really what he meant by man must be born again it isn't so much intellectual but something has happened down here that's changed that man listen to what he says he says it's changed his motives that means that means a christian might fall and stumble and hold no and they go to repent god but their motives are correct you can fall and stumble and make mistakes but you'll come right back to the line because you're motive god has changed your motives he's softened up your heart he's put he's put himself inside of there so that your motive he's giving you his motives your motives are not driven by trying to appease the flesh and trying to appease the lust of the flesh and the pride of life and all those things now your motives are lined up you want to be right with god's word he said it changes his ideas where you've got ideas that you're looking at things through a carnal idea until you get the new birth and then when he changes your mind he changes your he renews your mind to look at it according to the word now you're looking at things differently because your mind has been changed your ideas have been changed you don't think about things the way you used to and it changes your life now see there in the message the token he'll tell you how to identify the new birth now we might have sensations and all those kind of things there are sensations associated with a new birth one place he said one place he said after the without the new birth it's the sensation with the new birth it's a blessing so there's something that happens it's not without a reaction or whatever but the way that you can really tell is look at the before and after look at the before before you're all mired down in the mud and stuff of the world but after something begins to change the holy ghost will have an effect on the life of a believer and it will change you listen it will take it'll take your pain off your toenails and your fingernails it'll make a man pull his pants up and get a good get a good job it'll make him want to do the best and everything that he does and it'll make a girl put some clothes on it'll make somebody listen listen i know the message is not about closed hair and dress but it'll start off that way why because god is starting you off little by little changing you he'll change you and somebody going around with uh a young man going around with their underwear hanging out and their pants all down around their knees and stuff that shows something might have changed them a young man going around with their hair hanging all down in their eyes that shows something hasn't changed them but let the holy ghost get a hold of that person and something will something will have an effect it will have an effect on that person's life see now brother braham said in ephesians chapter 1 and verse 5 having predestinated us having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will and now that's where brother brown begins to talk about how now you've got now you're born again but you're actually predestinated to something and and to really understand what he's talking about in the rest of this sermon you really have to understand what predestination is and that's why he starts and thank god we've got the background here and brother dale's been hammering on what predestination is and i think it should really be soaked down in our minds but let's just do a little quick review now brother brown said if you go on wikipedia and look at what the prophet said the the wikipedia article for brother brown will say that brother branham was a staunch calvinist is that right yeah let's read this quote and see if that's right and brother ram said now i realize that i'm talking to both calvinist and armenians and i'm a calvinist as long as calvin stays in the bible then after that i'm an armenian i believe in the grace of god to keep the believer but i believe the believer has to have enough grace of god to stay with god in other words if you understand predestination correctly you can say well you're predestinated for this you're predestinated for that but you got you got a part to play in this and you know the way that the gospel is preached so many times it's almost confusing wording how brother branham would say that god chose you you didn't chose him now what's he saying he's saying that there you are in your house and you're there behind the door and you didn't go out of your door to go hunt for him he came to your door he came to your dwelling place and there you are behind the door like that painting where the doorknob is on the inside of the door and you're the one that has to open up the door and so god chose you you didn't choose him he came to your house and knocked on your door you didn't go to his house and knock on his door cause you didn't know like martin luther said you didn't without the holy ghost you would know nothing about god how would you know how how would you even know what you're looking for but when the gospel came it was the door knocking on your heart when you heard the gospel it's it's god knocking on the door of your heart and he's he's coming for you he's coming for why because he knew whether or not you would respond so you make it when you make it so much like you're just being pushed through a tube that's you that's that's you wanting god to force you yeah and what kind of a love relationship with that is would that be now speak get a little bit carnal here for a second what kind of a relationship what kind of a matrimonial relationship would it be for a husband to just knock his wife over the head like a caveman and grab drag her off to his cave and say i'm gonna force you to marry me i'm gonna force you that's the way that a lot of people believe predestination but god doesn't force anybody to love him that's the only way that god can actually manifest his love is to allow you to be able to respond if he didn't allow you give you the ability to open up the door and let him in then he becomes like a man just knocking a girl over the head with a with a club and dragging her off to his cave and he's forcing her and listen i'm not preaching a gospel of rape i'm preaching the gospel of love god wants you to love him back that's what brother ram tells in this whole story he will it's a love relationship the reason that pentecost failed was because they got out of love with jesus christ the reason that the ephesians church failed was because they forgot their first love it's because they got out of love the the bible the whole christian experience is based on love not forcing you know really really you can't you can't we we'll cry against people coming to church and cry against all kinds of things but it's got to be a love relationship you're not you're not going to come to church every service until you begin to fall in love with jesus christ you're not going to get on your bed at night and pray and read your bible every morning until you begin to fall in love with jesus christ and so that's what i believe that the gospel has sent to get you to fall in love with jesus christ because it won't work if you're not in love with jesus christ the whole story won't work if you're not in love and when you take love out then then what you're left with as a predestination doctrine based on force you're not forced into this god doesn't force nobody he's a gentleman brother brown said he'll come to you he'll he'll come and maybe he'll come to the doors of the church and if he doesn't feel welcome he'll just walk go right back away he'll come to the door of your heart and if you don't welcome him in he's a gentleman he's not going to force his way in he's not going to stick his foot through the door he'll turn and he'll go away maybe he'll come back again a week later or so and he'll keep knocking he'll keep knocking until finally your heart gets so hard that you say i don't want to let him in and he that's that'll be the last time because he's a gentleman god is a gentleman do you see why the predestination doctrine the wrong way is so wrong because you make god a forcer that he's forcing you to have a relationship with him god will never force you to have a relationship with him god wants you to love him the reason he came to your door is because he knows if you will yield yourself to his word he knows listen he knows whether you will prefer the word or just a sensation on your flesh he knows how far you will go he knows in advance and that's how he can predestinate it god knows if he has your heart or not tonight now think about that he knows right now if he really has your heart if you're just kind of going through the motions the dead works coming to church it's just all dead to you but when god raises something inside of you when you read easter morning when that word comes to life then it becomes not dead works anymore but he's got your heart and it becomes a love relationship brother adam said if your mind and heart and all doesn't agree with god's word and believe that he's the same lord jesus resurrected from the dead and peace in your heart and yet you belong to church be careful you might have a perverted mind instead of it being a changed heart brother brahman said that's stiff and it's hard but it's good so what god is after you see what god is after is a heart that will follow god that's where pentecost failed a heart that will keep following god brother ramon said then luther being god's man of the hour come out to bring the message it was a type of in the wilderness israel had a pillar of fire a pillar of fire and they followed it day and night and when that pillar of fire stopped israel camped under that fire that light and they stayed there until the pillar of fire moved on and israel moved with the fire and as he did in the natural for israel he's done in the spiritual for the church so when the holy ghost moves you had better move with it and it moved where did it move from luther to wesley to pentecost so there you can see that the same way pentecost fails it's the same way that the lutherans or when they organized and did not move on to wesley they failed when wesley did not move on to pentecost they failed when they denominated and said now we got it and they settled down and said well we got it we're not going to move on and they failed and so pentecost failed because they failed to move on and brother adam said there was a group of people a group of people that call themselves pentecost now if you really study the message out you'll find out that brother branham doesn't even refer to what we believe as pentecostal and well i'll get that in a little bit we'll just put that over on the shelf for a little bit brother brown said there was a group of people a group of people that called themselves pentecost they saw the pillar of fire and received the holy ghost they received the holy ghost they actually yes sir and receive the gifts of the spirit speaking in tongues and so forth but what did the devil do he come along and made them organized and they began to organize and draw fences and lines and you know what they just got so organized that they could not move with it in other words they settled for what they had they settled they so if you look at where pentecost failed and avoid that same situation don't settle for what you have now you've been born again now you've been you you've received the word uh you you've received enough word to be born again don't settle but just keep moving on and keep packing it in because where that came from there's more to be had there's more to be had where that came from brother brahma says we must not draw boundary lines we must say we believe this not end with a period but with a comma we believe this plutch plus as much as god will pour into our hearts i'm telling you this is where people fail at i i know from personal experience this is where people looking at people's lives my own my own experience looking at things this is where people fail at the brother braham said keep adding look at when elijah found elijah and told him to walk with him and then he said you tara here you terry elijah told elijah you wait here you wait here for i must go to another city do you think elisha was going to do that what if an angel from heaven told you you just stay right here at the new birth and don't go anywhere don't keep going on don't keep seeking god but he kept going on and elisha brother baby said elisha the prophet that was to take his place said as the lord liveth and thy soul liveth i'll not leave thee because elisha did not settle he was not satisfied with his present location that he went on to the next stopping point brother ram said now then he said i go up to the school of prophets the second journey he said you stay here but elisha said as your soul liveth i'll not leave you i'll not i'm not staying right here i'm going to keep going on now you see that god has given you stopping off points stop enough points to see if you're going to stay there if you're going to keep going you get to justification you go on the sanctification you go on to the baptism in the holy ghost the the word of the spirit quickening the word that you've held and now you're born again are you going to stop there or are you going to keep going on i believe that's one of the purposes of the message that brother brown brought to us is to to reveal to us that there's more to be had y'all excuse me he said you stay here but elisha said as your soul liveth i'll not leave you and he went on and when he got to the school of the prophets he said i crossed jordan he said you stay here he said as thy soul liveth i'll not stay here i'll go with you a determination to hold on regardless of the price move on brother brahma said keep going on with god deeper waters deeper experiences more love he said there's no limit to it it's unlimited how many times did brother brown say it's unlimited there's no limit to it it's unlimited you may keep moving into deeper and deeper experiences with god what where the word keeps opening up and what is it doing it's giving you confidence and what you have access to confidence that you've got access to the bank account why because you know what's in the bank account and you know how it works you know how you were born again you know what the spirit does you know what the word does you know the effect the spirit has on the word and you know how it all fits together and that's giving you confidence and ability to with making that withdrawal from that bank account and brother brown said now at the jordan representing death he come these other two places not death connected with it and then when he come to jordan representing death that you have to die out and then when he crossed jordan he got on the other side he turned to him and he said now what will you do that i do for you he wasn't backward he said that a double portion of your spirit come upon me and elijah said if you see me when i go away you shall have it in other words if you keep your eyes on me you shall have it and that's the way any belief that you know that's the way you preach the gospel you preach the gospel but not by looking at people's reactions and listening to the things that people say but you preached your gospel the gospel about just looking at christ and just pressing onward that's the way you live as a christian it doesn't matter what people say about you listen when you you take that first step as a born-again believer and right out of the gate people are going to be saying stuff about you and well you must have drunk something the way you shouted or whatever you know something must have been done to you the way you acted or whatever you acted a little bit different you look like an oddball but you got to ignore the things that people say about you people are going to talk people are going to laugh and point and stare but you got to ignore the naysayers and just keep your eyes right on the word and brother brahma said if you're really born of god it don't make any difference what the world says or what anybody else says you know where you stand and all devils in hell can't upset you then you prove it by your fruits not by your voice but by your life you live the right kind of a life a life that's not unsettled by things that people say about you there's a life that gets your head so far into the holy of holies that it doesn't matter what's going on outside and you're not listening to the naysayers and the other people you're not looking at the people that the other christians that have fallen by the wayside you're not looking at the other ministers they have not done the way that you thought they should but you you're just pressing on to the mark of the high calling in christ and brother brown said now when the pentecostal people and the free methodists and baptists and so forth when they received the holy spirit they said we got it we got it now that settles it and there's where they fail right we got it that settles it and isn't that what so many people in the message today believe that when you get the born when you're born again that settles it and that is so contrary to the message that brother branham brought you know maybe maybe some things that i the way that i preach and the way that i do is a little bit backwards or whatever but if the my ultimate goal and my motive is to get people to go back and listen to the to what brother branham actually said because if you'll do that it will change your life one of my kids i'm gonna share this little story anonymously one of my kids was talking to some friends that they had and they were they were struggling with whether or not they should actually go to a church that believes in the fivefold ministry and for a while they were going to a tape a tape only church and then all of a sudden out of the blue it changed and they started going to a church with a with an actual live living pastor and so one of my kids was asking well what changed what happened and they said we actually started listening to the tapes we actually started reading what brother branham said because when you actually start reading what brother branham said it will change you it makes a difference when you actually and so many times like brother dale was bringing out this morning we'll take somebody somebody what somebody else says for granted but i want you to not even take what i'm saying for granted don't take what the ministry is saying for granted but go find out for yourself like the bereans did and they poured through the scriptures and found out for themselves what was said and and something something will open up to you if you'll do that the method has said brother brother brother brown when we shout we had it that's what the messages used to say every methodist would shout brother you got it but they found out they didn't have it the pentecost said when they spoke with tongues we got it but you found out you didn't that's right life proves it seeing people speak with tongues like pouring peas on a dry cowhide and go out and cheat and steal and lie and everything else you can't call that the holy spirit but now wait i believe and i believe in shouting speaking in tongues brother around said but i'm trying to place something in you in other words he's trying to take those pentecostal people and give them some fundamentals so they know what they stand for but we believe in shouting we believe in running the house we believe in the holy ghost actually having an effect in you yes we do we believe in that we believe in the holy ghost moving on people we believe in a rushing mighty wind coming through and sweeping through we believe in it but we also believe in knowing what you believe and knowing what you stand for now listen listen as he was preaching this i'm telling you this kind of topic will stir people up and it stirred people up then when brother branham was saying this and he said you may be mad at me now but you won't be up there you may be mad at me now isn't that funny how so often the gospel will get people mad it will cause a reaction we were actually talking on the way up to church this morning about people that we had witnessed over through the years that would sit under the preaching of the gospel and when the word is being preached about how you need to come to church or or whatever it is people go on and they it actually causes a physical reaction that you can sit there in church and look over and see them official and they just can't sit still something something's taking place and then they come out of church says i'm never coming back here i know why because it caused a reaction something actually took place you see when you're going through a sanctified condition you begin you might get offended when the word is actually honing in on something in your life and it will actually cause a reaction people will bend over in their seats and act like they're asleep and just lean over against the wall and all kinds of stuff because it's actually causing a reaction you can see on people's faces many times when you're preaching you know i got to listen the other day to the message the forgotten beatitude and i would encourage you to go back and listen to that i want to remind you what the forgotten beatitude is when when jesus preached on the mount of olives he preached all the beating blessed are the hunger and they that hunger and thirst for righteousness blessed are the meek blessed all those kind of things but there was one that he didn't preach until he went over to john who was down there john the baptist who was down there in prison and he preached he just let loose with that forgotten beatitude blessed are those that are not offended in me blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me because so many times the word that when the word is being preached it causes an offense and somebody will be sitting there thinking well that that what's that minister got against me when actually you're just reading through quotes was it what what's what's brother wade or brother dale or whoever or what they got against me who's been talking around behind my back but it's the word that's actually being compared up against your life it's the minister holding the word up against your life and saying something don't match the minister don't even know it doesn't match but you there sitting there being offended something is something that's vibrating differently than the frequency of the word something is off you see the word that's why the bible says wheresoever also it is contained in the scripture behold i lay in zion a chief cornerstone elect precious and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded unto you therefore which believe he is precious but unto them which be disobedient the stone which this what's the builders disallowed the same is made the head of the corner and a stone of stumbling a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense even to them which stumble at the word being disobedient whereunto also they were appointed because the word you do you realize what the word is actually doing it is as it's being preached the word is actually trying to place you and we a lot of times are resistant to being placed isn't that what brother brown said that ephesian church was all about placing after they after they got through all their corinthian nonsense the little baby nonsense of play time now it's time to be placed and as the word is going forth the word is putting you in your place where the word says brother brown will say a woman's place is in the kitchen and it's placing you where if you're in your place now now see now we're getting where the rubber meets the road if you're in your place you'll be matching up with the word brother ram will tell you the bible tells you how to dress and how to live and how to do that a woman has to has to have her hair uncut though a woman is supposed to be wearing dresses and and not looking like a man and see that begins to place you when you line up with the word the word is actually placing you amen and as you continually grow the word the more word you hear the word is placing you it's putting you in your place and you are submissive to the word and you're allowing yourself to be placed to be put in your place just like what do you think this is this pyramid it had all these stones in it and there was a stone mason that would hew out the stone and put it in his place it would hew out the stone and place it and how are you placed the same way by the hewing of the word that word is hewing you and placing you exactly where he wants you to be right you know i think we get confused about that sometimes we want we want a big job i want a big job and then i'll be placed your job your role is to be placed by the word to do what the word wants you to do for that age and the words see so many times we resist how are you going to come to the adoption how are you going to come to adoption if you won't allow the word to place you to put you in the building to allow the stonemason to positionally place you and put you right into the slot where you're supposed to go and if there's a little bump hanging off you don't want you don't want that little bump to be chopped off and chiseled so that you can slot into place but allow god's word to just knock that off and you'll slide right into your place and listen a lot of times a lot of the times the things that brother branham said are hard to understand and hard to it's easy to resist but if you'll just yield yourself to it allow god to have preeminence in your life it's it's actually allowing yourself to be placed see we come to church we're not we're not we're not trying to make people mad or trying to preach things controversial we're trying to get a church to a place a place of placing where you can be placed a place where god can look at your conduct and the way that you act in the way that you behave and say that person is in their place they're placed i have placed them by my word and they're doing exactly what i want them to do they're matching up with the word for their age oh my the clock's skipping ahead let me just skip through some of this you know but seriously though if you analyze your own self most problems in the world today most problems at your work most problems in your relationship with your spouse start by somebody being offended and if you just lay like now it's like beginning to dawn on me why all these years brother dale was just saying sit on your feelings just sit on your feelings because that can solve a lot of problems if you'll just sit on your feelings and allow yourself to be molded by the word of god sit on your feelings and somebody else is being being being molded by the word and just sit on your feelings for a little bit most of the problems most problems start by being offended and being offended is your enemy because what is it it's being offended comes from you wanting to be treated a certain special way i want to be treated some some way that i feel like i deserve to be treated i deserve to be treated better than i'm being treated and then we get offended and most of the times most of the times we'll get offended when the truth is coming across that's all right and that's the reason why i'm kind of saying all this is because so many people have become offended by people saying that pentecost has failed like a preacher i'm not gonna name names or anything but i heard a preacher that preached uh fantastic one of the most admire one of the ministers i most admire in the message preached a sermon about this and it caused so much confusion about he he doesn't believe that pentecost he doesn't believe in a new birth no that's not when we when you when a minister says we've got to go beyond pentecost he's saying we've got to go to the maturity of the word to go past go to adoption he's not saying we don't believe in the baptism the holy ghost the moving of the spirit and all those things but when you say somebody somebody else said i'm bringing up all these conversations don't you love it when ministers do that and i talked to this brother and he said this and i said that but somebody said why why haven't i ever heard somebody else preach this well maybe your ears are stopped to it maybe you need to listen to the go back and listen to what brother branham actually said and it will up pull the stoppers out of your ears because brother branham did say that we've got to come to adoption that's the whole point of his message was bringing a bride to maturity so that he could point to the skies at a world born bride that's coming to maturity the purpose the purpose somebody else said so i was i was talking to a minister when i sat in his house and i sat in his house and we talked about the purpose of the five full ministry and he began to say well i believe that a ministry is just just to get people born again and get them to a place where they need to repent and then after that they just go home and listen to the tapes and it's kind of in other words it's all up to them and i said well that sounds contrary to ephesians chapter four where it says he gave some apostles prophets and some evangelists some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the saints now part of that is getting you born again but there's more than born again there's more than being born again you've got to come to perfection and it says for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man under the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ and that's where we get the statute of a perfect man because paul said it until we to a perfect man a perfect man which is christ unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ that we're being molded up until until christ is actually formed in us actually represented in us back again and that's what the minis that's what the five full ministry is for not just not to just get people to the altar but actually to bring us to adoption to a place of adoption and that's why in romans chapter eight now listen if you go back and read romans chapter eight it will parallel those three stages of elijah three stages of alive elijah are you gonna are you gonna stop here at being born again are you gonna stop here at a stash of a perfect man are you gonna stop here and you just keep going on are you going to stop are you no i'm not going to stop and romans chapter 8 verses 15 says for you have ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father so you come forth looking at your father and you continue growing but that's not the end of the story for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of god the creature is waiting what creature every creature the whole earth the whole urchin is waiting for the manifestation of the sons of god and that's why the five-fold minister the father ministry is to preach you need to grow you need something else don't settle at just the baptism of the holy ghost don't settle there's more where that came from and romans 8 23 and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of our body waiting for it there's more to come there's more to come so don't settle and and this was this is what brother brother dale was mentioning outside when we were talking about how the romans and i was being quiet because i had it in my nose but the romans the jews were you know we're looking at the romans that they're at their at their ceremonies and everything and i actually i went on the internet and found the ceremony of adoption this book called the story of civil civilization now i know y'all getting tired just hang with me just a few more minutes the romans actually this is the the way that the romans did it and the book called the story of civilization vol 3 caesar in christ and it says during a boy's teen years his father would determine when it was time for him to pass from childhood to adulthood the father would determine when it was time to pass from childhood to adulthood now this is a roman a roman father a roman citizen and typically around 14 or a little later in a formal public ceremony a formal public ceremony having put us why is it public because everybody can see the change in your life everybody can now it's not gonna be that you see like you have a voice every year or whatever all this big big to-do or whatever but it's public because everybody knows something happened right everybody can tell having put aside his childhood toga the toga you got at your birth and put us out now we're not we're not getting rid of the baptism the holy ghost but it's it's unfolding into something greater it's more of it right having put aside his childhood together he would appear in the toga varilus the toga of manhood the toga he he got given a new toga a different toga now as a christian you're not giving a new toga it's more of it because now you're coming to a place like the like the roman the roman child coming to a place of authority let's find out what kind of authority it says a mark of citizenship now he's a roman citizen and it has access to all the rights of being a roman citizen remember how paul couldn't be couldn't be killed or whatever that when they found out he was a roman citizen that oh we can't touch you because he was a roman citizen now when this child comes to a place where he is an adult and has access to being a roman citizen he's got access to that whole bank account he's got access to it all and his right to now vote in the assembly in other words now he's got a voice he can vote in the assembly when the boy was ready the possession to the forum began the father had gathered his slaves freedmen clients relatives and friends using all his influence to make his son's escort numerous and imposing here the boy's name was added to the list of citizens now he's recognized with authority as a roman citizen and formal congratulations were extended finally they all returned to the house where the day ended with a dinner party there was a meal as a as a supper given by the father in honor of the new roman citizen now see a son's status was elevated at this point he was now legally invested with all the rights powers and privileges of a son and heir of his father and of a citizen why why because the father his father had recognized him characteristics worthy of exchanging that childhood toga for the toga varilus for the toga of manhood worthy of giving him access to being a roman citizen and being recognized as a roman citizen now see do you realize when this begins to open up to you brother brown and christ the mystery of god reveal he said the new birth is christ is a revelation god has revealed to you this great mystery and that's a new birth this actually this actually becomes a birth to you that yeah you were born again but now you're birthed into the revelation of the age you're being born into something greater you're being born into what god wants you to be for this day he's be he's birthing you into a birth according to malachi 4 5 6. like brother brother dale was talking about this morning birth to end to a place of authority and adoption where you have access to the bank account and you can put your name on the checkbook just like just right next to jesus christ and have confidence that the funds will not be overdrawn y'all doing all right if i go a little bit longer yo be careful what you ask for or what you agree to now brother branham i'm really merging several sermons i'm merging brother brown talks about this and and uh why where pentecost uh failed and uh desperations and once more so if you look in the sermon once more and look in the sermon desperation he really begins to nail down the reasons why pentecost failed and takes a closer look at it and he begins to talk about all these old testament examples that otherwise you would never have associated with pentecost failing and one of the examples he uses was samson there and he and the bible says the philistines be upon these samson and he wished not the lord was departed from him doesn't that sound like the pentecostal church and that's the example that brother brown was using to illustrate the pentecostal church and he would say now samson still had his big big old body and that's just one of the only times that i found where brother brown referred to samson not being a little scrawny fellow but having a big body and what point was he making the point he was making was yeah the pentecostal church is still the pentecostal organization it's still a big body of members just like samson still had his big body of his big strong body but yet his eyes were poked out right and he began to cry out once more you know brother brown said samson sampson preferred instead of following after the word he got all he got he he followed after sensations he was more interested in delilah he was more interested in the lust of the flesh and the pride of life that he was interested in the word and that's where pentecost failed and see if you look at that that's where you you and i can fail if you're so if you're more interested in sensations and things of this world than the word of god then you'll fail and brother i was saying that once powerful once powerful at azusa street they cut off his seven locks the word and they put out his eyesight they blinded him to the truth they blinded him to the truth so that he could not see and brother brown said he was raised up for this purpose and but where is the word the strength being manifested it's been cut off from you by your power shaving organizations he had failed god not only he had he failed god but he failed his own people he was a total failure now he was a prisoner to the very nation that god raised him up to destroy just like pentecost became a prisoner to the to the roman system to the denominational system the very thing that it had been raised up to destroy and now it became a prisoner to that now and there's there's sampson a big strong warrior that now has his eyes blinded now let's look at another example now this will really get you now jacob you know we know the story of how jacob did everything he could to get the birth right he he got that birthright and brother brown said you know all the different stories and things that after the birthright how he he impersonated his brother and how he he worked all the different years for for rachel and leah and finally he come to a place after he had betrayed after he had he he had with his little shyster self he had done that to esau to get the birthright now he come to a place where he realized that he was lacking something and brother brandon said in genesis chapter 32 verses 67 and the messengers returned to jacob saying we came to thy brother esau and also he cometh to meet thee and 400 men with him then jacob was greatly afraid and distressed because he was afraid that he was going to die now now he realized that something was lacking in his life now now when you come now yeah you've got you're born again you've got the spirit of god in your life you're born again but yet you know that there's something lacking in your life and what that thing is that you're lacking is adoption is the token the token life now brother brown i'm i'm getting into another message let me i'm gonna get too complicated now brother brown said in the message desperations he said he thought in his own mind that he knew that the birthright meant to him meant everything to him and he didn't care how he had to get it just so he got it and after he got it he thought everything was all right because he had the birthright he thought the thing was settled jacob thought the thing was settled because he had the birthright now what about what about people in the message today that they think all the message is is to be born again and that's it but if you think that you'll fail just like jacob did like just like just like uh samson did just like all these examples just like pentecost did fail to see that that is not all there is brother brown said again the next paragraph and he said see he didn't care how he done it just so he got it the birthright and he thought when he got the birthright that settled it pentecost there is where you failed you thought because you were born of the spirit born of the spirit of god the birthright that settled it but it only starts it amen you remember in the message and he goes on talking about adoption and he said then if it did not prove out to be an obedient child of the father's will it aired nothing yet it was a son but he aired nothing if he wasn't interested in the father's work and so when the holy ghost fell upon the pentecostal people and they begin to restore back the gifts and things that was in the church they thought because they were born of the spirit that settled it right but you see there is a placing of a son brother ram said and then there was a placing of the sun that he had heir of everything the father had now brother branham he goes on to say now jacob thought because he had the birthright that everything was made so did the pentecostal people when they began to organize the oneness threeness and trinitarians and all kinds of organizations and fussing and pulling at one another proved that the token wasn't showing right now let me call your attention to something real quick brother brown preached a token the evening after he preached the token he preached desperations in the evening the evening after he preached a token in the morning he preached a token in the morning and then that afternoon he started talking about you got to be desperate for something desperate for what desperation will kick in when you realize there's something still lacking in your life that yeah you've been born again but there's still some something that you've got to mature into brother brown said now we've tried to jump the fence we've tried to stick the cart before the horse you tried to claim things and do things before god did it and got a lot of flesh worked up into it and that's what's the matter with the church he said there isn't something wrong it isn't wrong with god it isn't wrong with your faith it's being placed right knowing what you're doing and how to do it that's the secret of the whole thing and then yielding yourself to the will of god and that's why placing placing by the word is so important because the word is actually putting us where we're supposed to be in the word and when you're placed brother ram said when the child was born he was a son but his conduct had to do with his inheritance now i want you to be real honest now he said don't you think that we've tried to push the inheritance just a little bit further farther than god our conduct went that's what's the matter today we should be way on up the road yonder but we're way back down here my goodness i got so many notes i don't even and our conduct what is our our conduct is the holy ghost conduct that's what god wants to do is look upon our life and see see holy ghost conduct do you realize that's what the statue of a perfect man the statue of a perfect man is not learning about something and just being like well that's a good idea the statue of a perfect man is actually the holy ghost working in you the life of god that's why virtue virtue is not just virtuous living but it's power and strength the power and strength of the holy ghost actually working in the hearts and lives of the believer it's actually where that gives you power to lay hands on the sick and they will recover it gives you power to speak the word and life will be given into somebody else that they can be born again by the words that you speak that somebody else can actually draw from your strength because it's not your strength it's holy ghost strength it's it's holy ghost knowledge it's not your knowledge by your intellectual understanding but it's holy ghost knowledge where god is revealing to you the correct interpretation of the word it's holy those patients where when you look at somebody with real holy ghost patients you're looking and saying i know that that's not a man living under some natural influence that's got to be that's got to be a work of god that's the kind of public display that god wants to see and an adopted son of god where you look at somebody i know that that's not that man doing that of his own will that's holy ghost temperance holy ghost control holy ghost control over that man's life that when something somebody smites him upside the face that he's in control that the holy ghost in that man is in control and he does just smite back and his holy ghost god in us to know what god wants done with the word and to match up with what the word says that's what godliness is godliness is to do what god wants done to know what he wants done to act like him to be like him because god's living inside of you and the holy ghost has moved into you it's holy ghost holy ghost brotherly kindness not just being nice to somebody but the holy ghost in you living that out and it's a holy ghost token which is love that'll come down on the on the individual and capped him off as a sealant son of god that god can look at that individual and say there is somebody that all of that word that they've held has been mixed with love and that is a lovely like brother brown said in the statue of a perfect man the sweetest kindest humblest individual you have ever seen listen that's the kind of person i want to be i wanna i don't wanna be just like some some mean as a snake worldly snake in the grass i wanna be the kind of person that somebody can look at me and say that's the holy ghost that's a holy ghost life living in that man holy ghost living in somebody that's that's somebody that god can adopt you see i'm gonna close on this that's that's what the message is now you see you see that's where i i know sometimes i sound critical on things well i'm talking in private but the message is not just about being born again and it is not just about closed hair and dress the message is about god actually molding you putting his life into you and building you into the style a living idol a living a living tabernacle what god himself is living inside of you and he can cap you off and adopt you and say there's somebody just like me there's somebody walking around that is in the if they have been placed by my word when i preached a word to them they didn't shout they weren't offended they might have been offended at first but they yielded themselves over time the the stone makes them chipping away until finally that i could put them exactly in the pyramid right where they're supposed to be placed they allow themselves to be placed by the word they allow themselves to be emboldened that's what the message is the message is to bring a bride to adoption that god can use for his purpose a message to tell you not to settle let's stand to our feet the mission musician can come forward the message the message is don't settle for what you've got but keep moving on keep moving on because there's more where that came from how could we not love a god that just gave all for us that died and sacrificed everything and rose from the grave on this easter morning so that we could have a part in this right so that you could reach out to the lost and reach out to your lost family and share the gospel with them this is this is such an amazing message we heard we've heard you know the message is true because you can tell that it's true because it continually unfolds and the more that you hear and the more that you receive the better and the greater and the greater it gets so don't ever settle don't settle and say well i'm just stopping here i'm satisfied don't settle let's worship the lord a little bit uh [Music] you must fight keep on [Music] it is no disgrace in the service he will find no place so keep on well you must bite the break [Music] just keep on the firing

would win for god in the righteous keep on the fire amen you know that's true you have to fight for every inch of ground you take it's easy to be a christian but it's hard too cause you got to fight continually you have to fight when the doctor says something's wrong with you you're going to have to fight with somebody when people say give you dirty looks or weird looks that when you're walking through the sisters walking through the supermarket with your dresses and things you're fighting it's a fight it's a continual fight you got to fight just like those old testament believers when they
