[10:46] afternoon um W you won you just give the
[10:49] Lord a hand clap of praise for
[10:50] everything we've heard this
[10:56] morning I was I was kind of you know
[10:58] just jesting where brother Aon like how
[11:00] am I supposed to follow that this
[11:01] morning that was that was wonderful
[11:02] Masterpiece and brother Lise also I sure
[11:05] appreciate um setting the stage for
[11:07] everything
[11:08] today um well I'm just going to I'm
[11:11] going to take the same scriptures this
[11:12] afternoon that I took Wednesday night
[11:14] and just kind of do a a little rehash
[11:16] and uh and and talk about some of those
[11:20] things again let's just go to the Lord
[11:21] in pray Lord we're so grateful to be
[11:23] able to gather around your word Lord
[11:24] Jesus and look into these things and
[11:26] these things that will give us strength
[11:29] to equip us to fight the
[11:31] devil lord I pray God that you'll help
[11:33] us this afternoon that you'll give us
[11:35] strength to give it back to the
[11:37] devil lord the devil seems like he's
[11:39] just run rough shot over so many Lord
[11:42] and it shouldn't be when you've given us
[11:43] such power such promises laying here in
[11:45] the
[11:46] word and I pray God as you'll just
[11:48] anoint the hearers anoint the speaker
[11:51] Lord this afternoon Lord and Lord just
[11:54] move Among Us to this afternoon Lord God
[11:56] to give us strength help us now Lord we
[11:59] pray pray in your name
[12:01] amen so just take for a title the the
[12:04] enforcement of restoration reclaiming
[12:06] what belongs to us you know we we it's
[12:09] one thing to know that there's some
[12:11] things that belong to you but how do you
[12:12] get it how do you get it so that's what
[12:16] I want to just kind of hammer on tonight
[12:17] this afternoon it's not night but
[12:20] afternoon so in Joel chapter 1 veres 1
[12:23] it says the word of the Lord that came
[12:25] to Joel the son of pethel here hear this
[12:29] ye old men and give ear all ye
[12:31] inhabitants of the land hath this been
[12:33] in your days or even in the days of your
[12:35] fathers tell ye your children of it and
[12:38] let your children tell their children
[12:40] and their children another generation
[12:42] that which the Palmer worm hath left
[12:45] hath the Locust eaten and that which the
[12:48] Locust hath left hath the cankerworm
[12:50] eaten and that which the cankerworm hath
[12:52] left hath the caterpillar
[12:56] eaten think about what uh you know
[12:58] brother R said that these are insects
[13:00] that kind of evolve one into the other
[13:02] they go into each each is a different
[13:05] stage of the next what the strange way
[13:07] to depict what would these things look
[13:10] like these are not natural insects we're
[13:13] talking about these are
[13:14] spiritual it's just it's the devil
[13:16] moving through the
[13:18] stages but in Joel chapter 2 it says and
[13:22] I will restore to you the years that the
[13:24] Locust hath
[13:25] eaten the korm and the caterpillar
[13:29] and the pommer worm my great Army which
[13:31] I sent among
[13:32] you and you shall eat in plenty I like
[13:36] that now you're going to have plenty to
[13:38] eat amen and you're going to be
[13:41] satisfied and praise the name of the
[13:44] Lord your God so there's some praise
[13:46] bundled up in there that true worship is
[13:48] going to be restored that hath dealt
[13:51] wondrously with you and my people shall
[13:54] never be ashamed you don't have nothing
[13:56] to be ashamed about when you believe
[13:58] this amen amen you may be seated the
[13:59] Lord out his Blessing to the reading of
[14:01] the
[14:03] word now uh you know sometimes I I think
[14:08] it it we if we kind of get out of this
[14:11] mode of you know when we come to church
[14:13] we're not coming to hear a lecture or
[14:16] coming to hear a seminary speech or
[14:18] coming to hear uh somebody recite some
[14:21] words but we're actually coming to do
[14:24] battle there there's actually something
[14:26] spiritual happening and you know many
[14:29] times we we kind of gets away from us
[14:31] that there are there are you know
[14:34] brother random said that the angels of
[14:35] the Lord would accompany the word when
[14:39] the message is being preached the
[14:41] scripture says that the angels of the
[14:43] Lord are camped around those that fear
[14:45] Him the angels of the Lord are here and
[14:49] brother B said the devil likes to be in
[14:51] church the devil likes to get in amongst
[14:54] us so there's something Supernatural
[14:57] happening that is beyond what we can see
[14:59] with our own natural
[15:01] eyes and you know you think about these
[15:04] these bugs here the pommer worm or
[15:06] strange insect and a locust and a
[15:10] cankerworm and a caterpillar and all
[15:13] these bugs this Army that was sent to to
[15:16] take away the things that were promised
[15:19] from you and
[15:20] I and I I really I I really began to
[15:23] meditate on these are not just it's not
[15:25] just a story but these it symbolizes an
[15:29] actual spiritual happening something
[15:32] spiritual taking place amen I I I I
[15:36] personally have some experience personal
[15:38] experience overcoming and fighting
[15:40] battles with the devil I I remember when
[15:42] I was younger uh before I the Lord
[15:46] really began to deal with me uh it in
[15:48] kind of in that in between time I knew I
[15:51] needed to be saved but I hadn't really
[15:53] started to fight
[15:54] yet and
[15:56] uh one one night I was I took a little
[16:00] nap after I got home from school and and
[16:02] I was laid on the bed and I fell into
[16:05] asleep and I had a dream and in the
[16:08] dream I was laying on my bed and I was
[16:11] looking up at the ceiling and I saw this
[16:14] looked like a locust looked like a bug
[16:17] that was about 5T long sitting up uh on
[16:20] the on the ceiling of the room where I
[16:22] was
[16:22] in and I opened my eyes from sleep and a
[16:26] strange dream the room was was in the
[16:29] exact same stage as it was when I was
[16:32] asleep every I was positioned the same I
[16:35] was on the bed the same the only thing
[16:37] different is like the shutter open my
[16:38] eyes open and so what I'm trying to
[16:41] express with you is that there are
[16:43] things that we fight there are things
[16:46] that you're fighting even now that you
[16:49] might not be able to see but it's real
[16:52] so what I'm reading about a locust when
[16:54] I'm reading about a PM worm I'm not
[16:56] reading just about some story but I'm
[16:59] reading about something real right and
[17:02] you know when a minister preaches that
[17:04] many times they're not just preaching
[17:05] from something that they've learned in
[17:07] like a seminary or something but they're
[17:09] preaching from a personal experience and
[17:12] if I have overcome by the blood of the
[17:15] lamb and the word of my testimony then I
[17:17] can relay to you in the same way how you
[17:20] can overcome if we are overcoming we're
[17:23] not speaking from something we just
[17:25] learned in a school but we're speaking
[17:28] from something that we have personally
[17:30] experienced so what I'm relaying to you
[17:33] this afternoon is that there's a promise
[17:35] in the Bible that these things will be
[17:37] restored to you and whatever the devil
[17:39] has tried to take away from you there's
[17:41] a promise that it will be given back to
[17:44] you now if it's given back to the church
[17:48] it's there's a promise laying here that
[17:49] it'll be given back to the bride as a
[17:51] whole but what about to you as an
[17:54] individual but because you are part of
[17:56] the body of Christ that same promise is
[17:59] related to you individually because
[18:01] you're part of the Bride that that we're
[18:04] talking about a bride tree but you're
[18:05] part of that tree so all these promises
[18:08] that are given to you oh we're part of
[18:10] Christ so everything promised to him
[18:12] We're join a with him so we get part of
[18:14] that and everything promised to the
[18:16] bride we're part of that we're part of
[18:17] that body so restoration is promised to
[18:20] you and I so when brother brandham says
[18:23] that these things can be enforced we're
[18:25] not talking about just learning
[18:27] something in school but talking about
[18:29] going to battle against the devil and
[18:32] you know I think sometimes we fail to
[18:34] understand that the devil the devil can
[18:35] attack he'll attack somebody that ain't
[18:37] even born again yet but then he'll come
[18:39] and attack somebody that's born again
[18:41] and and like sister Shepherd begin to
[18:44] pounder in her mind and make her think
[18:46] that she ain't born again and take away
[18:48] her peace and take away your joy and TW
[18:51] you don't even you come to church and
[18:53] you're wondering if you're still born
[18:54] again yet you're wondering what's real
[18:57] and what's not and that ain't right
[18:59] that's the devil trying to take it away
[19:01] from you you know brother R said that
[19:03] cancer was one of the worst worst
[19:05] diseases one of the worst things but you
[19:08] know he said worse than that is
[19:10] nervousness he said and you know that's
[19:12] what the devil it's a devil that will
[19:14] come and plague somebody put some plague
[19:16] little little poor little sister with
[19:18] nervousness get all nervous and you know
[19:21] why that's such a horrible thing because
[19:22] if you're nervous you just can't hardly
[19:24] think straight you can't get your mind
[19:27] lined up to look at the word of God
[19:28] correctly but you know God give us a
[19:31] promise that you don't have to be
[19:32] nervous you don't have to be fearful you
[19:35] don't have to wonder if God's word is
[19:37] true because God's word said it and if
[19:39] he promised it he'll stand behind it now
[19:42] see that's how you enforce the claim of
[19:45] God how you enforce it as you look at
[19:47] what God Said and you said God you said
[19:50] it I'm going to take advantage of what
[19:52] you promised now now going back to my
[19:55] own personal experience I I I I I
[19:59] there's many things that I've related to
[20:00] my family that I will not go through now
[20:02] but I I had a real real when I was
[20:04] younger real battle with the devil and
[20:07] how you want to overcome when you're the
[20:09] devil's putting thoughts into your minds
[20:10] and and coming to you with all kinds of
[20:12] ideas and telling you you ain't this and
[20:14] telling you ain't that is you you must
[20:16] take it back to the word the word is how
[20:20] you do battle with the Devil the word is
[20:22] your ammunition the word is the thing
[20:24] that you can it ain't just something
[20:26] that we're learning about it's something
[20:28] that is real that will really give you
[20:30] overcoming power against the devil now
[20:34] you see you you watch you watch young
[20:35] people sometimes they'll get on their on
[20:37] their FaceTime with their friends and
[20:39] they'll giggle about life or whatever
[20:41] and then later on they'll go back and
[20:43] and they'll say well well I've been
[20:44] having these depression thoughts and
[20:46] things but you see if you get away from
[20:48] all the thing all the things of this
[20:50] world and put your nose in the Bible put
[20:52] your nose in the scripture I'm telling
[20:54] you this it will work when you really
[20:56] need something from God if you if you'll
[20:58] begin to lay hold of what God promised
[21:00] and say well you promised that you're
[21:03] able of these stones to rise up children
[21:05] to Abraham you promised that you will
[21:07] not give a stone to somebody that's
[21:09] asking for a blessing you promised it
[21:11] that God will back up his promise now
[21:14] that's how you get real overcoming power
[21:16] in your life that's how you see your joy
[21:19] and your peace and your faith and all
[21:21] that the devil took away from you
[21:23] restored and God wants to give you back
[21:26] everything that the devil took away from
[21:27] you maybe tonight you're sitting here
[21:29] the devil's taking so much away from you
[21:31] maybe he's taking away your health maybe
[21:33] he's taking away all all the things that
[21:35] are listed here but if God said it could
[21:37] come back it'll come back if you believe
[21:39] it it just depends on your belief it
[21:42] depends on your faith one time this
[21:44] little sister come up in the prayer line
[21:46] and she said brother brandom she was all
[21:48] in a turmoil of her mind brother brandom
[21:51] I I I feel like nervous I I feel like
[21:54] nothing's right nothing everything's
[21:56] wrong I feel like every the world's t
[21:58] upside down and she said he he began to
[22:00] talk to her and encourage her and and
[22:02] and she said should I feeling like this
[22:05] I feel like I'm about to die should I
[22:09] still believe oh what a question for a
[22:12] prophet and he said he said you yes you
[22:15] should believe in spite of all the
[22:17] conditions in spite of all the
[22:19] circumstances oh it doesn't matter what
[22:22] the world looks like it doesn't matter
[22:23] what it doesn't matter what your flesh
[22:25] looks like it doesn't matter what mental
[22:27] condition you're in just look at God's
[22:29] word and believe look at God's word
[22:32] God's word is the ammunition that you
[22:34] need to overcome
[22:38] am the Locust that Locust is real you
[22:42] know you know what I did when the devil
[22:44] began Onslaught with me is I it it made
[22:47] me get serious it made me get real
[22:50] serious I I I knew I needed God maybe
[22:53] you're at a a at a junction time in your
[22:55] life where where you just hadn't really
[22:57] got serious yet or you're serious about
[22:59] your friends you're serious about
[23:01] Facebook you're serious about the movies
[23:03] that you like to watch you're serious
[23:04] about all these things and then at the
[23:05] end of The Journey you got depression
[23:07] and mind battles and all those kind of
[23:09] things but if you'll just get really
[23:10] serious about whether these things are
[23:13] true or not get really serious like the
[23:15] berans they got the flipping through
[23:17] their scripture and checking out what
[23:18] Paul was preaching get really serious
[23:21] about the word and get really serious
[23:22] about believing God's word that's how
[23:24] you'll get overcoming power oh
[23:27] restoration means to bring back to the
[23:29] former owner to to bring back to a
[23:32] former state of condition to make things
[23:34] right not to just Patch It Up not to
[23:37] just take a hole in the tire and put a
[23:38] patch on it but to bring it back to the
[23:40] way that there what the way that the
[23:42] owner originally saw it the way that God
[23:45] started you in his mind before the
[23:47] foundation of the world that's what God
[23:48] wants to bring you back bring you back
[23:50] to where you've got power and authority
[23:52] over the devil and you don't have to
[23:54] listen to none of his junk you don't
[23:55] have to listen to none of his trash that
[23:57] he brings to you you you don't have to
[23:58] listen to it because you won't take none
[24:00] of his garbage oh you know what a
[24:03] terrible thing to lose part or all of
[24:05] your inheritance if we realize what a
[24:07] terrible thing it is to lose your
[24:09] inheritance when you when you when God
[24:11] promised to you Joy that you can have
[24:14] joy that you that you can have peace in
[24:16] your heart and not be tossed about
[24:18] hither and yawn not to be tossed about
[24:20] wondering whether or not you really got
[24:22] the baptism of the Holy Ghost or
[24:25] not but what a wonderful thing to see it
[24:28] restored yes I got to reading in the in
[24:31] the Bible there's a story in Numbers
[24:32] chapter
[24:35] 27 about this man named zapah
[24:39] had he was a man from the tribe of
[24:42] Manasseh and he died without any sons
[24:44] and all he left just
[24:46] daughters now in the Old Testament law
[24:49] daughters they didn't have no
[24:50] inheritance sorry you're out of look if
[24:54] you a girl you didn't get all this land
[24:57] that zalafa had had all the property all
[25:00] the all the men servants servants what
[25:02] whatever was on the list the role of the
[25:04] inheritance and we'll say it like this
[25:06] all the joy all the peace all the love
[25:12] all that packaged up in the inheritance
[25:14] was gone cuz they were daughters and
[25:16] they didn't have nothing oh but they got
[25:19] they went up to Moses and they begin to
[25:21] plead their case and Moses went before
[25:23] God and he went before the elders at the
[25:24] Ten of meeting and God answered back and
[25:27] what he did was he made a Prov he
[25:29] changed change added some things to the
[25:31] Old Testament law and made a provision
[25:33] so that they would not lose their
[25:34] inheritance they could go back and claim
[25:37] because there were there would not been
[25:38] a provision before but now there was a
[25:40] new inheritance law that was set up to
[25:43] allow daughters to inherit if there were
[25:45] no Sons now I thank God that sometimes
[25:48] you you might think that there's no way
[25:50] back to what you have lost but God by
[25:53] his grace gives away back to restore to
[25:55] you the things that were lost you know
[25:57] that's what Grace is is Grace is where
[25:59] God God being a a god of Integrity a god
[26:03] of Honor he required he required faith
[26:06] and he required he required Holiness and
[26:09] when we fail that the only thing that
[26:12] the only thing that can meet that
[26:13] requirement was a sacrifice and a
[26:16] sacrifice had to be made to meet the
[26:18] requirements of a god with Integrity a
[26:21] god with honor and so now we're not
[26:23] looking we're not looking to our own
[26:24] merits but we're looking to his grace
[26:27] where he paid the price on the cross oh
[26:29] that's what Grace is Grace is unmar
[26:31] favor to pay the way back to our
[26:34] inheritance to pay so oh that's what
[26:36] that's what brother Aaron was preaching
[26:37] about this morning if you need something
[26:39] this morning if you're looking in the
[26:40] word of God and it says you've got a
[26:42] right to it you've got a right because
[26:44] the price has already been paid Jesus
[26:47] already paid the price on the cross now
[26:49] that that doesn't matter whether it's
[26:51] whether it's healing in your body
[26:53] whether you got problems in your back
[26:55] whether you got problems in your mind
[26:57] whether you got problems in your soul it
[26:59] doesn't matter God's bringing you you
[27:01] know faith is one of the fruits the
[27:03] theine fruits of the spirit and this is
[27:05] not just little baby Faith but this is
[27:07] mature Faith where you can lay hold to
[27:09] the promises of God and say like Abraham
[27:11] it doesn't matter what the conditions
[27:13] are but if God promise me a child I'm
[27:15] going to hang on to his promise and I'm
[27:17] going to see it fulfill in my life Faith
[27:20] is one of the promises one of the
[27:21] promises are the fruits of God faith
[27:24] where you can believe what God
[27:26] promised God is restoring us back back
[27:28] to what to brotherly love to a real kind
[27:31] of love a real kind of love where we
[27:33] look past the differences with one
[27:35] another a real kind of worship and
[27:38] worship real worship is based upon a re
[27:40] a true revelation of of Jesus Christ a
[27:43] Unity among Believers the power of the
[27:45] Holy Spirit and re Revel what is it it's
[27:48] the unrestricted life of the Holy Ghost
[27:50] through flowing through the
[27:54] church to do what drive out the devil
[27:58] drive out the devil and you can see
[28:00] where these these these these bugs they
[28:03] ate down all these things through the
[28:05] church ages they ate them down but God
[28:08] give us a promise that he's going to
[28:10] restore so he sent these four life
[28:12] Messengers to restore Martin Luther and
[28:16] John Wesley and what is it it's not
[28:18] they're not restoring just some things
[28:20] that we learned in a seminary just some
[28:22] things that we can learn about and store
[28:24] up in our memory but there they're
[28:26] restoring back the power of God God in
[28:28] the church and now that's what I believe
[28:30] that this is speaking of the power of
[28:32] God restored in the church where you can
[28:33] walk in power and walk in Liberty and
[28:36] walk in peace and walk in Joy walk in
[28:39] the true baptism of the Holy Ghost the
[28:41] true token restored walk in the
[28:44] understanding the rapturing faith of the
[28:46] Elijah the Capstone message of
[28:48] Elijah that was promised of in 1
[28:50] Thessalonians
[28:51] 4:16 the Lord himself shall
[28:55] descend I thank God that he didn't just
[28:57] send it
[28:58] but he come
[29:00] himself the Lord himself shall descend
[29:03] from heaven with a shout and with the
[29:05] voice of the Archangel and with the
[29:06] Trump of God and the dead in Christ
[29:09] shall rise first he's coming with a
[29:12] message he's come with a message and the
[29:15] voice of the Archangel to follow that
[29:17] pattern is when the bride begins to get
[29:19] it the bride begins to get it that you
[29:22] don't have to take nothing from the
[29:23] devil and begins to recognize the devil
[29:26] in all his tricks the devil comes with
[29:28] his mind battles and his thoughts now
[29:30] you do you see how to fight the devil
[29:32] this afternoon the devil you're you're
[29:35] like on a pendulum and if you start
[29:37] looking at the word of God you've got
[29:38] power over the devil if you start
[29:40] listening to the LIE of the devil then
[29:42] the devil can swoop in and start taking
[29:44] the joy out of your home he can start
[29:46] messing with your Harmony he he he'll
[29:48] start coming in but if you just keep
[29:50] your eye right on the Promises of God
[29:52] that's how we enforce it and brother
[29:54] said if a claim is made on something to
[29:56] make that restoration
[29:58] you can enforce it to make it come back
[30:02] to its right
[30:04] place oh you can enforce
[30:07] it you can enforce now now that's some
[30:10] that's a powerful
[30:11] statement that that how you going to
[30:13] enforce it by believing what God's word
[30:17] says amen That's How Strong the word of
[30:20] God is that you look at God's word and
[30:23] believe it and it will do what it says
[30:26] amen now that's how you young people
[30:28] that's how you fight the devil when the
[30:30] Devil comes with all these thoughts
[30:31] where you ain't nothing you ain't worth
[30:33] nothing none of your friends like you
[30:34] none of your friend listen you you
[30:36] you'll come down to the end of the road
[30:38] one time and find out that it really
[30:39] don't matter how many people like you or
[30:41] don't like you oh we we sometimes we
[30:44] want to go through life and we want to
[30:46] we want to we want to end up without any
[30:47] critics without any anybody saying
[30:50] anything negative about us but I I'm I'm
[30:52] sorry to tell you if if you live a life
[30:54] of sin people are going to say stuff
[30:56] about you if you live a life of right
[30:58] some people are going to say stuff about
[30:59] you I I I get astonished sometimes
[31:02] listening to these preachers that I
[31:03] greatly admire that the great Fighters
[31:06] and Warriors of the faith and they'll
[31:07] talk about how people say stuff about
[31:09] them they're believing and and see great
[31:11] Miracles following their Ministry and
[31:13] thing and people will say see it doesn't
[31:15] matter how close to God you live it
[31:17] don't matter people are going to say
[31:19] stuff no regardless so you might as well
[31:22] just forge ah head and look straight at
[31:24] God's word and ignore all the
[31:26] critics amen
[31:31] you're going to have critics anyway you
[31:34] sure are you're going to have critics
[31:35] anyway no matter what oh you think about
[31:38] just like the children of Israel were
[31:40] going back to the original there's so
[31:42] many stories of a restoration in the
[31:44] scripture just like zalafa had and and
[31:46] just like Ruth and the children of
[31:48] Israel going back into the promised land
[31:50] and you know when the children of Israel
[31:51] got back into the promised land and
[31:53] Joshua began to place them exactly where
[31:55] they were supposed to go they still had
[31:57] some fighting to do you are not going to
[32:00] overcome without a battle character is a
[32:03] victory it's not a gift you got to go
[32:05] through some uh like some Louis or
[32:08] somebody was saying this morning you you
[32:09] got to go through some suffering right
[32:11] you got to go through some trials to see
[32:13] how you're going to react what's your
[32:15] reaction going to be you know when the
[32:17] children of Israel got in their promised
[32:18] land they had they had the old corn of
[32:20] the land laid out before them they could
[32:22] they could eat those those seven seal
[32:24] mystery promises laying out for them you
[32:26] know Joshua even wrote the land of the
[32:29] the few tribes that were left over in a
[32:30] seven sealed book and sealed it up and
[32:32] they had all those things laying there
[32:34] in the promised land but they had to
[32:35] fight for every inch of ground they they
[32:37] wanted they had to fight for every they
[32:39] had to fight for their love and fight
[32:40] for their joy and fight for their peace
[32:42] it wasn't it wasn't going to be any
[32:44] peace without fighting fighting for it
[32:45] you got to fight for what you for what
[32:47] God has
[32:49] promised and you know they came up
[32:51] against the you know what a Philistine

[36:51] don't want none of that now see that's
[36:53] the same way with your W you put up with
[36:56] all the stuff that the devil puts in in
[36:57] your mind you put up with the evil
[36:59] spirits you put up with this Locust
[37:02] that's riding your back and you can't
[37:03] see it you put up with it and people
[37:06] will actually put up with a ghost in
[37:07] their home I don't understand it but
[37:09] you're not called to put up with stuff
[37:11] you're not called to put up with the
[37:13] devil you're called to cast it out oh
[37:15] that's what that's what church is for
[37:17] church is not for lectures church is for
[37:19] casting out Devils that's what Jesus
[37:21] said in Mark 16 you're called to cast
[37:24] out devils in my name they'll cast out
[37:26] Devils they'll lay hands on the sick and
[37:28] they shall recover and that's what
[37:30] church is it's not for just coming
[37:31] together to drink coffee it's to cast
[37:33] Devils out to die to oursel to yield
[37:36] ourselves so that the spirit can flow in
[37:37] us to have overcoming power and listen I
[37:42] I I don't want to see the Devil Run R
[37:44] riding rough shot over nobody it Grieves
[37:47] any minister to see people afflicted by
[37:49] the devil in their body and sickness to
[37:52] be afflicted in their mind to be
[37:54] afflicted in Soul that grieve somebody
[37:56] to be so Afflicted in their soul to
[37:58] where they they're just a toxic person
[38:00] and they just got to they got to like I
[38:01] was preaching Wednesday night they got
[38:02] to take joy from somebody else and I'm
[38:05] sorry if this offends you preaching like
[38:07] this but listen God ain't called you to
[38:09] be like that God has called you to be
[38:11] nice and gentle and sweet not a mean
[38:13] horrible person but he's called you to
[38:15] be a real true Christian part of this
[38:18] brid Tre tried brid tree with a nine
[38:21] nine fountains pulsing up from on the
[38:23] inside pulsing out pushing up from the
[38:25] roofs to push out the nine fruits and
[38:28] the nine gifts of the
[38:30] Spirit brother that offends me you know
[38:33] brother Bram said that if you can't take
[38:39] correction this is our problem this our
[38:42] problem when we come to church whether
[38:44] than dying out we want to Bow up we want
[38:46] to blow up like a bullfrog well you
[38:48] better not t say nothing to me about
[38:49] what I'm doing you realize I I I I
[38:53] wonder if on the day of Pentecost
[38:54] everybody was blowing up like that
[38:57] well you better not say nothing to me
[38:58] about me paying time you better not say
[39:00] nothing to me about this just blowing up
[39:03] and you know you'll never have Harmony
[39:04] blowing up like that reaction like that
[39:06] reacting God wants somebody that can
[39:08] take can take a little bit of of
[39:11] Correction can take correction by the
[39:12] word and say say in humility lay that
[39:15] Pride down to the side lay that Pride
[39:18] down and die out to yourself instead of
[39:20] letting all that anger and animosity
[39:22] rise up but say Lord if there's anything
[39:24] wrong with me I want it to be cut out
[39:27] you know brother said Elisha was not the
[39:31] robe was not cut to fit Elisha but
[39:34] Elisha was cut to fit the robe and you
[39:36] will never try to cut the word you will
[39:39] never match up with this word by trying
[39:41] to cut the word to match up with you but
[39:42] you've got to match up with the word
[39:44] Elisha has got to be cut and Elisha
[39:46] types the bride Elisha types the bride
[39:49] and so we've got to cut our we we've got
[39:52] to be cut to match the
[39:55] word that's the only way we'll have over
[39:57] coming power that's the over only way
[40:00] we'll be able to enforce the
[40:03] r brother R
[40:06] said he didn't give them their
[40:07] inheritance he led them up to the land
[40:09] but Joshua divided the land of the
[40:11] people is that right and Christ brought
[40:13] the church up to the place to where
[40:15] their possession was made to them was
[40:16] given to them just the Jordan to cross
[40:19] but the holy spirit is the one who sets
[40:21] the church in order the Joshua of the
[40:23] day puts the church in its order giving
[40:25] to each one gifts places
[40:28] position what is it it's God using each
[40:31] one of us in our own capacity in our own
[40:33] different ways to benefit the body
[40:36] molding us into His Image so we fit in
[40:39] the right place and you see that's what
[40:41] I was preaching on Wednesday night if
[40:42] we're not right in our place if we're
[40:45] not in subjection with the word then
[40:48] that's where that's where you'll find
[40:50] all the imity and strife and divisions
[40:53] and things rising up because one wants
[40:55] to be like the other one wants to sing
[40:57] like the other one wants to preach like
[40:59] the other one wants to do better or I'm
[41:01] better at works everybody's comparing
[41:03] themselves with one thing or the other
[41:05] instead of going back to the word of God
[41:08] the word of God is our measuring post
[41:11] the word of God is our metric not one
[41:14] another you see you all you always get
[41:16] that's that's the pro been the problem
[41:18] down Through the Ages people that that
[41:20] seven thund Doctrine for example
[41:22] everybody trying to find seven men that
[41:24] they can follow after instead of looking
[41:25] to Christ trying to follow after
[41:28] somebody and that's been our problem we
[41:30] always try to find somebody that we can
[41:31] hang on to their coattails and follow in
[41:33] instead of getting a real experience
[41:35] with Jesus Christ for personally for
[41:40] ourselves it's looking back to the word
[41:43] you see that's how you enforce that's
[41:45] how you enforce any claim that's how you
[41:46] can enforce a claim against the devil
[41:49] devil you got to get out is you take it
[41:51] back to the word look back into the
[41:54] mirror of God's
[41:55] word you know this morning you know here
[41:58] I am with this three-piece suit on I
[41:59] look like a a peacock or something and
[42:03] and I you this morning you know you
[42:04] getting ready and you you got we got a
[42:06] full floor length mirror and you can get
[42:08] in front of that mirror and you can look
[42:09] at it and say well well well look uh
[42:12] look at look at how I look maybe you can
[42:14] call your wife over and say come look
[42:16] look at me in this mirror and you know
[42:18] when you look in a natural mirror you
[42:20] start thinking about all the flaw you
[42:21] you look you can't help but see all the
[42:23] flaws I you know I joke around with my
[42:25] kids about how I I I the older I get the
[42:28] I got bags under my eyes big enough to
[42:29] carry groceries in you know you got bags
[42:31] in your knees and and you just you know
[42:33] you you can't help but see the all the
[42:35] frickle the salty salt in your hair you
[42:37] know and you're you're getting old you
[42:39] get the skin spots and and and you you
[42:41] look in a mirror and you you start
[42:43] thinking well there is there anything
[42:45] good to this you know I'm getting a
[42:47] little ball spot on my head I got
[42:49] glasses now I can't hardly see I can't
[42:51] even read without glasses and there's
[42:53] all these faults when you look in a
[42:55] natural mirror and I could I call my
[42:57] wife over and my kids and be like well
[42:59] look at
[43:01] that and what you going to get you're
[43:03] just look you're looking at the outside
[43:05] but on the inside is a soul something
[43:08] that's worth worth more than a a million
[43:11] worlds moreth worth more than all these
[43:13] Galaxy something that's really worth
[43:14] something and you want to find something
[43:16] you want to find what your soul really
[43:18] looks like then you got to go to a
[43:20] different mirror you got to go to the
[43:22] mirror of God's word now see then you
[43:25] you look in a natural mirror and call
[43:26] everybody to look look at that look at
[43:27] look at that and that's that gets a
[43:29] little bit weird doesn't it but you look
[43:31] into the mirror of God's word and you
[43:33] start telling somebody look what this
[43:34] says about me and it takes on a
[43:37] different tone doesn't it it sounds a
[43:39] little bit different when you say look
[43:40] look what the Bible says about me the
[43:42] Bible says that God is going to restore
[43:45] all the things that the devil took away
[43:47] from us the Bible says that anything
[43:50] that I can believe that's written here
[43:52] is mine the Bible tells me don't forget
[43:53] about all these benefits that I got the
[43:55] Bible tells me that by his CR Stripes
[43:57] I'm Healed and the Bible tells me that
[43:59] I'm going to sit with him in his throne
[44:01] I'm going to sit with him in power the
[44:03] Bible tells me I'm a join air with him
[44:05] the Bible tells me that I can overcome
[44:07] by the blood of the lamb and the word of
[44:08] his testimony the Bible tells me to come
[44:10] boldly to the throne of grace the Bible
[44:13] tells me that he's he's the high priest
[44:15] of My Confession that anything that I
[44:18] confess that he's my mediator and he'll
[44:19] take it before the Throne of God and act
[44:21] on my behalf to bring the things that I
[44:24] confess coming out of his word to bring
[44:26] them to fruition
[44:27] now see then it takes on a different
[44:29] thing when you start looking at the word
[44:30] and see that's how you get power over
[44:32] the devil look at what the word says
[44:35] stop looking at them bags under your
[44:37] eyes and the salt in your hair and all
[44:39] the imperfections cuz look there's a lot
[44:41] of things that are wrong in our lives
[44:43] there's a lot of imperfections we can
[44:45] look at uh when I I I used to joke every
[44:47] morning when I get on the elevator at
[44:49] work I the elevator door was shut and
[44:50] I'm listen for the popping
[44:53] money because you're getting older and
[44:55] your joints start popping and everything
[44:57] starts falling apart but down inside you
[45:00] there's a soul that God is molding
[45:02] molding In His Image he's molding that
[45:05] inward man that character to be like him
[45:09] oh and if I want to know what I have
[45:10] access to I look into the word of God
[45:13] and I can
[45:14] see so that's all that matters all that
[45:17] matters all that matters is that what
[45:20] Jesus says about
[45:21] me if we could really if that would
[45:23] really fall into our heart all that
[45:25] matters is what Jesus says I reminded
[45:29] that time you know that uh little
[45:32] Rebecca and little Sarah they got up in
[45:33] brother bram's lap and and they were
[45:35] kind of arguing over who you know one of
[45:38] them said well I got all of daddy and a
[45:41] little Rebecca I think it was said it
[45:43] may be that you got all of daddy but I
[45:44] want you to know Daddy's got all of me
[45:47] so if we just get all wrapped up in
[45:49] Jesus it don't matter you know he he's
[45:51] got room enough in his lap for all of us
[45:54] we start poking and everything and but
[45:56] you know all it matters is that Jesus
[45:58] has God us that's the only thing that
[46:01] matters is what Jesus thinks about me
[46:05] amen now listen I'm trying to give you
[46:08] I'm trying to give you like in the
[46:09] greatest battle ever fought brother R
[46:10] said that ministers equip Us and how to
[46:13] get out of the
[46:15] eggshell I'm trying to equip how to get
[46:18] out of the eggshell it does not matter
[46:21] how many friends you got or don't have
[46:24] it does not matter how many likes you
[46:26] get on Facebook
[46:27] it does not matter how many people think
[46:29] that you're good or bad or whatever all
[46:32] that matters is that Jesus has got you
[46:35] all that matters oh you just you're
[46:38] going to go through the Hall of critics
[46:39] I can assure you that you're going to
[46:41] walk through the Hall of critics and
[46:42] what the critics do is they actually
[46:44] manifest they point out that that you
[46:46] are real that you're real and you got to
[46:50] go through the Hall of critics you got
[46:51] to go through the Hall of critics where
[46:53] people say that ain't real that ain't
[46:54] right it ain't for you and all manner of
[46:58] things and and and surely listen some of
[47:01] the young people you you know you get it
[47:03] when you when you go to Camp you you get
[47:05] just bombarded with all this stuff
[47:07] people are horrible on Instagram and
[47:08] whatnot but hold on wait till you grow
[47:10] up because it don't stop the devil
[47:13] continue the devil is there when you're
[47:14] young the devil is there when you're
[47:16] middle-aged the devil is there when
[47:18] you're old probably probably if the Lord
[47:20] carries and and we're old and and still
[47:22] fighting this battle there'll still be
[47:24] people saying horrible saying and doing
[47:26] horrible things but what matters is you
[47:29] keep your eye right on Jesus Christ keep
[47:31] your eye on the word and that'll help
[47:33] you keep your sanity amen amen you don't
[47:36] have to be concerned about what the
[47:38] other fellow
[47:39] thinks brother Brown said don't it don't
[47:41] embarrass me to say I believe every word
[47:43] of

[47:47] that I've been filled with the Holy
[47:48] Ghost listen everywhere you go you're a
[47:51] witness and I I mentioned earlier that
[47:53] the little girls working at Chick-fil-A
[47:55] people say strange things about why do
[47:57] you wear do you wear a dress all the
[47:59] time you're going to have those critics
[48:01] but then there'll be trickles of people
[48:04] coming through like the other day a

[48:13] Christian see you got to go through the
[48:15] Hall of critics you got to go through

[48:41] watching you you're an influence to
[48:44] people they are watching the life you
[48:46] live they're watching and brother R said
[48:49] if you know what you're talking about
[48:50] you're not
[48:52] ashamed if you know what you're talking
[48:54] about you're not ashamed I'm not ashamed
[48:57] of the Gospel of Jesus Christ for it's
[48:59] the power of God and the Salvation to
[49:01] everyone that believes and again what am
[49:03] I talking about this afternoon I'm
[49:04] talking about restoring give restoring
[49:06] back the things that the devil's trying
[49:09] to take from you that you don't have to
[49:11] be ashamed the devil try to take your
[49:13] joy and try to take your worship and
[49:15] that's what that's why people can't
[49:17] really worship the way that God wants
[49:18] them to because they're ashamed of it
[49:21] they're ashamed to raise their hand
[49:22] they're ashamed to say Amen in church
[49:24] you know you you go back and see what
[49:26] brother r said he said PE he said if
[49:28] people wouldn't amen me I wouldn't want
[49:30] to preach to them if people wouldn't
[49:32] amen and this message the restoration of
[49:34] the brid tree said if if it was a church
[49:37] when I was preaching my heart out and
[49:38] and people weren't saying sicken boy why
[49:40] would I want to preach to somebody that
[49:42] didn't believe what I was preaching oh
[49:44] you see that's what we're called to a to
[49:46] a Revival a spiritual Revival where we
[49:48] know what we're fighting and we know
[49:50] what we're here for and we're not coming
[49:52] to church just to drink coffee and just
[49:54] to see our friends but to do battle
[49:56] against the spirits of the devil we're
[49:58] not we're not warn against flesh and
[50:00] blood but against powers and and
[50:02] principalities and brother R said it
[50:04] don't embarrass me to say that our Lord
[50:06] has showed me Visions when a man meets
[50:09] God talks to him and the reality of God
[50:11] becomes his in his heart he's not
[50:14] ashamed of it every man in the Old
[50:16] Testament wasn't ashamed of the word and
[50:19] he said if I'm a Christian and been
[50:20] filled with the spirit wearing the
[50:22] testimony of Jesus Christ Resurrection
[50:24] don't let any devil try to push you
[50:26] around
[50:27] don't be ashamed of him in this
[50:29] generation sinful perplexed this sinful
[50:32] adulterous and full of old all putrified
[50:37] sores now listen we got something that
[50:39] we shouldn't be ashamed of amen amen you
[50:42] know I I I used to think maybe this was
[50:45] arrogant but I'd be riding the subway
[50:47] and i' i' you know it'd be jostling and
[50:49] we I'd look around and I think these PE
[50:52] maybe this is arrogant thought to have
[50:54] these people don't realize that there's
[50:55] a Son of God on this train
[51:00] these people caught up in and in and the
[51:02] in in the world you know you see all the
[51:03] ads floating by for for pills and stuff
[51:06] that people can take and yet yet the
[51:08] world is going by and and they're
[51:10] they're not ashamed of their sinful life
[51:13] they're not ashamed of the horrible
[51:15] clothes that they wear that just reveal
[51:16] everything every every dimple and every
[51:19] every fold and every crease they're not
[51:21] ashamed of that but a real son or
[51:23] daughter of God that's clothed in
[51:24] righteousness walking in a dress amongst
[51:26] the world where everybody looks
[51:28] everybody's going to look at you if you
[51:29] wear a dress as a real Christian lady
[51:31] and you shouldn't be ashamed of that you
[51:33] shouldn't be ashamed of your hair that's
[51:35] worn long as a sign that you believe the
[51:38] message of the Angels the Ministries
[51:39] that you've heard that you've heard the
[51:41] word that they're preaching you
[51:42] shouldn't be ashamed with it why because
[51:44] God has given you Liberty and he's given
[51:46] you power to overcome the Devil he's
[51:49] given you overcoming Power by the word
[51:51] that you've heard and you don't have to
[51:53] be ashamed of it you don't have to be
[51:56] ashamed of because you've got joy you
[51:58] don't have to be ashamed because you've
[52:00] got peace in your heart I'd rather have
[52:02] peace in the in my heart than all this
[52:04] nonsense of the filth of the world
[52:06] wouldn't you would you want to have
[52:08] peace in your heart if God has if the
[52:10] devil has robbed you of that peace then
[52:12] it can be restored to you tonight here
[52:14] in the service cuz I believe that God is
[52:17] here brother B said the devil robs
[52:19] individuals of their Joy he said the
[52:21] first fruit of the spirit Brotherly Love
[52:23] is what the devil robs him of he said
[52:25] the Vitality of faith and and God's word
[52:27] is what the devil robs him of he robs
[52:29] him of peace of mind and Assurance the
[52:31] devil aims to create Discord so he's
[52:34] robbing people of their peace he's he's
[52:36] robbing people of a pursuit of a holy
[52:39] life he's robbing them of a spiritual
[52:41] vision and understanding he's robbing
[52:43] them of the ability to grasp and hold on
[52:46] to the truth and he's robbing them of
[52:48] their
[52:52] Assurance you see restoration is not
[52:55] only a past return but is is a present
[52:57] taken hold if we can realize that we
[53:00] could take a hold of it right here right
[53:02] now whatever is laid in God's word we
[53:05] can claim
[53:06] it claim it brother Ram said the law or
[53:10] the spirit of God is to force Satan to
[53:12] give up that which he has unrightfully
[53:14] de deceitfully taken from God and he
[53:17] said if Satan has robbed you of the
[53:19] privilege of being a son or a daughter
[53:21] of God we have a right this morning by
[53:23] the Holy Spirit to enforce the claim of
[53:27] God I think that's a real Faith Builder
[53:30] right there when the devil starts coming
[53:32] with his
[53:34] Onslaught I I say I like to say a lot in
[53:37] the middle of the night you go back in
[53:38] the prayer lines a lot of times is
[53:40] that's when brother Brandon would say
[53:41] that the devil will onl in the evening
[53:43] it's in the evening when you get nervous
[53:45] it's in the evening when you get
[53:47] frustrated it's in the evening when you
[53:49] can't sleep it's in the evening cuz
[53:51] that's when the devil attacks maybe that
[53:54] parallels in the evening time but listen
[53:57] you don't have to take it you can look
[53:59] look to straight to God's word and God's
[54:02] word will work you've got a right to
[54:05] enforce the claim of God so you don't
[54:07] have to be ashamed you don't have to be
[54:09] lost you don't have to be sinick you
[54:12] don't have to be dejected you don't have
[54:15] to be without hope you don't have to be
[54:17] prideful you don't have to be arrogant
[54:20] and you don't have to be contentious you
[54:23] don't have to be all those
[54:25] things you know what the the wool that
[54:27] the devil pulls over our eyes that he
[54:29] just he just wants to make a deal with
[54:31] us well it's just the way it is I've
[54:35] been sitting beside this pool of
[54:36] Bethesda for years I just I just guessed
[54:38] it's the way it is but one day Jesus
[54:40] come
[54:41] by the the woman with the issue of blood
[54:44] well she' been like that for a long time
[54:46] but that don't make no difference I just
[54:48] I guess I just got to deal with us but
[54:50] you don't have to deal with it see we're
[54:52] not talking about reforming where we
[54:54] just patch things up but we're talking
[54:55] about full restoration full restoration
[54:58] where the devil's taking away all these
[55:00] things all he's what is he taking away
[55:02] the power he's taking away the joy he's
[55:04] taking away the confidence in the word
[55:06] that it will do what it says it does
[55:07] that's what the devil's taking away the
[55:09] faith that's faith is one of the nine
[55:11] fruits of the spirits because what he's
[55:12] taking away the confidence that the word
[55:15] of God will perform like it like it
[55:17] should and he eats it back he eats it
[55:19] down he eats down all the the
[55:22] uh the producing where it produces he
[55:26] eats down to where it's just nothing but
[55:28] just some things that we learn and it
[55:30] don't produce anymore that's what the
[55:32] devil want that's what the devil is
[55:33] trying to do in your life just eat it
[55:35] down until it doesn't produce in your
[55:37] life anymore it's just something that's
[55:39] just laying there in your memory but
[55:41] you've got a right to what what is full
[55:43] restoration to return back to the
[55:46] original teaching to return back to the
[55:48] full access to the nine spiritual gifts
[55:51] to return back to genuine brotherly love
[55:54] to return back to a position where faith
[55:58] in God's word is affirmed to return back
[56:01] to genuine joy and peace to return back
[56:04] to genuine Divine Fellowship to return
[56:07] back to healing through the rights given
[56:09] by Christ sacrific to return back to
[56:12] power and authority over demonic forces
[56:15] to return back to a restoration to an
[56:18] enduring relationship with God that's
[56:20] what I want is a relationship with God
[56:23] to really know him and the power and the
[56:24] demonstration of the do you know that's
[56:26] how the gospel is even supposed to be
[56:27] preached the that's what Paul said the
[56:29] gospel's got to I came not to you with
[56:31] words of wisdom but in the power and the
[56:33] demonstration in other words that it
[56:36] will actually perform it's not just
[56:38] something that we learn and that we
[56:40] recite a book of rules but it will
[56:41] actually manifest that when we come up
[56:44] for prayer and we lay hands on the sick
[56:46] that they actually recover that when we
[56:48] call for the dead to come back that it
[56:50] actually works that when we believe for
[56:52] something when we believe for Sight to
[56:54] be restored spiritual natural it
[56:56] actually works that's what full
[56:59] restoration
[57:00] is oh you remember in the Bible how the
[57:03] in in in in the book of Kings one of the
[57:05] Kings was told that story of the
[57:07] shunamite woman where her her dead son
[57:09] was restored back to life and and Elisha
[57:12] told the woman he said now go after
[57:15] after her son was restored he told her
[57:17] to go and sojourn and and get away
[57:19] because the famine is going to come on
[57:20] the land and she went away and sojourned
[57:22] for seven years but after seven years
[57:26] come back looking for inher her all her
[57:28] property after seven years just like at
[57:31] the end of uh at the end of the seven
[57:32] Church ages in 2 Kings chapter 8 veres
[57:36] 1-6 is where this story is and the woman
[57:40] arose and she did what Elisha told her
[57:42] and she went with all her household and
[57:44] she stayed in the land of the
[57:45] Philistines for seven years but after
[57:47] then seven years it was time for her to
[57:49] get her inheritance
[57:50] by and it came to pass at the seven
[57:53] years end that the woman returned out of
[57:55] the land of the Philistines and she went
[57:56] forth to cry unto the king for her house
[57:59] and for her land and the King talked
[58:01] with gazi the servant of the man of God
[58:03] saying tell me I pray thee all the great
[58:05] things that Elisha had done and it came
[58:08] to pass as he was telling the King how
[58:11] he had restored a dead body to life that
[58:13] the woman whose son he had restored to
[58:15] life cried to the king for her house and
[58:17] for her land and gazi said oh my Lord oh
[58:21] King this is the woman and this is her
[58:24] son whom Elisha restored to life life
[58:27] and when the king asked the woman she
[58:28] told him so the king appointed unto her
[58:31] a certain officer saying restore all
[58:34] that was hers all the land that she had
[58:38] take it and give it back to
[58:40] her after seven years all that was all
[58:43] all that was hers and look at it like
[58:45] this all that was in the mind of God all
[58:48] that he wanted you to have now at the
[58:49] end of the seven the seven Church ages
[58:52] now is being restored back and look he
[58:54] said not just restore all that was hers
[58:56] but he said and all the fruits all the
[59:00] fruits of the field since the day that
[59:02] she left the land even until now so all
[59:05] the land and all the fruits is being
[59:09] restored oh uh there's that's a that's a
[59:12] big promise now all the fruit the fruit
[59:14] of joy and peace and love and and a
[59:17] sound mind you know that's what the
[59:19] devil the devil I've seen people sit in
[59:21] church and the devil will rob them of
[59:23] their peace and they'll sit for maybe 20
[59:25] years coming up for prayer over and over
[59:28] I wonder getting old getting gray-haired
[59:30] I wonder if I'm really born again and
[59:32] why is the devil robbing you of your
[59:34] peace and and many times it's because of
[59:37] misinterpreted theology they'll look at
[59:39] something that's maybe is presented a
[59:40] little bit off kilter and they'll get it
[59:42] in their head they get it in their head
[59:44] that they can't be saved and they're
[59:46] looking at things from a legalistic
[59:47] standpoint but oh that's what the word
[59:49] had to be preached in truth and power to
[59:51] restore back their true understanding of
[59:54] all these things so that you could have
[59:56] peace in your mind peace to know whether
[59:58] or not you're really born again or
[1:00:03] not I I God to think to think this
[1:00:07] afternoon that God wants you to know God
[1:00:09] wants you to know if you're really and
[1:00:11] if you're really lost that's what we
[1:00:12] come to church for to be convicted you
[1:00:15] know sometimes we we come to church and
[1:00:17] people get upset I I feel like I'm
[1:00:18] getting preached on too much well listen
[1:00:21] it might be because we're trying to get
[1:00:22] you to see that might there's something
[1:00:24] off-kilter in your life we're preaching
[1:00:26] we're preaching something the message
[1:00:28] not just to build people up like a a a
[1:00:30] popcorn sermon where a bubblegum sermon
[1:00:33] where we're getting everybody all pumped
[1:00:34] up and we can be happy but oh it'd be
[1:00:36] good to see some real conviction break
[1:00:39] loose to see somebody really recognize
[1:00:42] that there's a flaw in their life where
[1:00:43] they really need God oh that's what the
[1:00:46] gospel is supposed to be to preach not
[1:00:48] just not just not just the good things
[1:00:50] not just a Prosperity Gospel but to
[1:00:52] preach somebody to a place where they
[1:00:54] can recognize that they need more of God
[1:00:56] to where they need
[1:00:59] something and lay it down lay all that
[1:01:01] all those weights that so so easily
[1:01:03] beset us lay down our pride and lay lay
[1:01:06] all those things that are that the
[1:01:07] devil's wanting us to pack on our
[1:01:10] back he said we got a privilege we've
[1:01:13] got the privilege to enforce upon Satan
[1:01:15] the claims that God give us for God has
[1:01:18] a law and his word is a law and God in
[1:01:21] this word made certain claims to the
[1:01:23] church therefore we have a right to
[1:01:26] Force these claims upon Satan say give
[1:01:28] it back and he has to do it right he has
[1:01:32] to do it now these These are the
[1:01:35] promises that I laid claim to when when
[1:01:37] I was seeking the new birth these are
[1:01:39] the laid promises that I laid claim to
[1:01:41] for years and years is when the devil
[1:01:43] begins to assault you with all these
[1:01:45] things in your mind you just trust what
[1:01:48] God said I've got a right that gives you
[1:01:51] a right God's word gives you a right yes
[1:01:54] it gives you a right to say boo to the
[1:01:57] devil you know the devil is the biggest
[1:01:59] bully there is he'll come in like like a
[1:02:03] like a school Bulet give me everything

[1:02:09] your joy and you know just like a bully
[1:02:11] in school a bully won't back down until
[1:02:13] you stand up to
[1:02:15] it that's it's I I've always I've always
[1:02:18] been fascinated behind the mentality of
[1:02:19] bullies it's like they just don't have
[1:02:21] any self-awareness sometimes and you
[1:02:23] just have to stand up to them to make
[1:02:25] them back down and that's the same way
[1:02:27] with the devil you got to say boo back
[1:02:28] to the devil Sorry Devil you can't have

[1:02:55] world but this place is
[1:02:58] separated that's your natural house and
[1:03:00] your spiritual
[1:03:02] house oh we look at things like that you
[1:03:06] know you separate you you clean up your
[1:03:09] house clean up the place where you live

[1:03:24] with some lemonade and and and has some
[1:03:26] supper prepared for you that's what
[1:03:27] brother brandom said now that's peace
[1:03:30] and that peace comes from having your
[1:03:32] home cleaned up and that's Joy you want
[1:03:35] real Joy have your home cleaned up and
[1:03:37] the devil kicked out and that's Joy when

[1:03:42] sanctuary where you can come home from
[1:03:43] the things of this world and rest and
[1:03:44] put your feet up and there ain't all
[1:03:46] this stuff on the television you ain't

[1:03:58] Joy in your heart where you don't have
[1:04:00] to be nasty and ugly to somebody because
[1:04:02] you got peace in your heart and that
[1:04:04] peace in your heart you can translate
[1:04:05] transmute out to somebody else and give
[1:04:07] it to somebody else because you got
[1:04:10] peace right brother Bob this is horrible
[1:04:12] the way you're preaching yeah but it'll
[1:04:13] give you
[1:04:16] power it'll give you power and you know
[1:04:18] what a real Eagle will like this kind of
[1:04:21] preaching I I think you know you look in
[1:04:23] the Bible well let me I'm going to stay
[1:04:26] off that but listen if the devil took
[1:04:28] something from you take it
[1:04:30] back if the devil took your joy take it
[1:04:32] back if the devil took your peace take
[1:04:35] it back cuz we've got a holy ghost right
[1:04:37] to enforce our claim and brother R said
[1:04:40] the lawgiver the holy spirit is himself
[1:04:42] is here the agent of God to see that
[1:04:44] it's
[1:04:46] done he forces it so maybe tonight as
[1:04:51] we're going to be closing in a few
[1:04:52] minutes you could ask this question are
[1:04:53] you ready for the devil to take his
[1:04:56] hands off
[1:04:58] amen now that's a battle in your mind
[1:05:01] you say we don't like to talk about the
[1:05:02] devil do you do we but if you're sick
[1:05:05] it's the devil causing you to be sick if
[1:05:08] you got a mind battle it's the devil if
[1:05:11] you're nervous in your mind it's the
[1:05:13] devil if you don't have peace in your
[1:05:15] heart it's the devil if the devil's
[1:05:18] taking any of these things from you it's
[1:05:20] the devil but if you're ready and
[1:05:23] believe the devil has to go
[1:05:26] if you're ready and believe the devil's
[1:05:28] got to go oh now that see that sets an
[1:05:30] atmosphere of faith when the atmosphere
[1:05:33] begins to change where you're looking
[1:05:34] steadfast at the word of God and and and
[1:05:36] you begin to meditate on his word and
[1:05:39] the devil has got to go oh just like
[1:05:42] just like a evil spirit in somebody's
[1:05:44] house you start playing we were talking
[1:05:46] about somebody that did this they bought
[1:05:47] a haunted house and and they they saw
[1:05:50] like little boys moving through and all
[1:05:51] this kind of walking down the hall just
[1:05:53] weird stuff but they got to play in the
[1:05:55] the message I just left it
[1:05:57] playing set the atmosphere set the
[1:06:00] atmosphere of faith and the devil had to
[1:06:02] go it didn't hang around too long and
[1:06:05] listen you set an atmosphere of faith
[1:06:07] and believing and look at the word of
[1:06:08] God and and claim it not just half
[1:06:11] Hazard but really hang on to it hold it
[1:06:13] in your heart and the devil has got to
[1:06:16] go now it isn't that revealed in the
[1:06:19] seals how do you get the devil to go
[1:06:22] it's the word of God a and the word of
[1:06:25] not God not just by learning something
[1:06:27] like you're in a seminary but lay hold
[1:06:29] and claim it and expect something to
[1:06:31] happen that's why brother R would say
[1:06:33] come expecting because we're not coming
[1:06:35] to church just to just to to to see
[1:06:37] expect to see how how nice brother Bob
[1:06:39] got his three-piece suit on or what kind
[1:06:42] of tie brother Aaron has or or to see
[1:06:44] whether somebody's going to remember my
[1:06:45] birthday from behind the pulpit or
[1:06:47] whether they go how they're going to
[1:06:48] sing my anniversary song but we're
[1:06:50] coming to to have to to to we're
[1:06:53] expecting something we're expect ing
[1:06:56] that God will move we're expecting a
[1:07:00] Revival in our hearts we're expecting to
[1:07:03] be lit up by the word on the inside
[1:07:05] we're expecting for God to come and turn
[1:07:07] the light on like nobody else can there
[1:07:09] ain't no man that can turn the light on
[1:07:11] there is a man that can turn this light
[1:07:13] on turn on the revelation of God that'll
[1:07:15] illuminate and drive the devil out the
[1:07:18] word of God revealed in a repentant
[1:07:20] heart will drive the devil out amen are
[1:07:22] you ready for the devil to take his
[1:07:24] hands off maybe this afternoon you're
[1:07:26] sitting here with all these perverted
[1:07:28] natural desires and we're living in a
[1:07:30] world an age where the world don't even
[1:07:32] know what gender they are and and let me
[1:07:34] tell you there's people in this world in
[1:07:35] this even in this message that the
[1:07:37] devil's got in their mind that they're
[1:07:38] battling out whether they're whether
[1:07:40] they're gay or straight or whether
[1:07:42] they're this or that or whether they're
[1:07:43] whether they're a boy or a girl whether
[1:07:45] all these things but God wants to drive
[1:07:47] that devil out and straighten up your
[1:07:49] mind and straighten up your thinking and
[1:07:51] you don't have to be a subject to all
[1:07:53] this filth of this world all the stuff
[1:07:55] that they got on the internet for you to
[1:07:56] read about you don't have to be subject
[1:07:58] to that you don't have to be subject to
[1:08:00] all the vaping and all the all the
[1:08:02] clothes and all the drugs and filth the
[1:08:04] worldly influences of peer pressure but
[1:08:07] the devil oh are you ready for the devil
[1:08:10] to take his hands
[1:08:11] off what are we doing we're creating an
[1:08:14] atmosphere of Faith where Satan has got
[1:08:16] to go oh that's what church is all about
[1:08:19] creating an atmosphere of Faith where
[1:08:22] the devil is not welcome creating an
[1:08:25] atmosphere Faith where we know that
[1:08:26] something's going to happen why cuz the
[1:08:28] brid tree has got to come forth in
[1:08:30] restoration all these thing things have
[1:08:33] to be restored and and to be restored
[1:08:35] back into the church true power true
[1:08:39] character true fruits of the
[1:08:42] spirit and brother Braham said when the
[1:08:45] tree was planted on the day of Pentecost
[1:08:48] and he said he brought that tree there
[1:08:49] for a
[1:08:50] purpose on the in the Statue of perfect
[1:08:52] man he said they had all these virtues
[1:08:54] in here
[1:08:56] all these qualifications of true
[1:08:58] character a church with true character
[1:09:02] he said this tree was to Bear nine
[1:09:04] different kinds of fruit nine different
[1:09:06] kinds which means nine fruits of the
[1:09:08] spirit to go with the nine spiritual
[1:09:11] gifts that was God's tree he planted it
[1:09:14] in the Earth on the day of
[1:09:16] Pentecost how you you think what you
[1:09:18] know when we go to Costco or Aldi or any
[1:09:21] of those grocery stores you know you
[1:09:22] come out with a little basket full of
[1:09:23] fruit and nine kinds of fruit is a lot
[1:09:26] you you could have oranges and lemons
[1:09:29] and and and and uh strawberries and and
[1:09:32] all kinds of things and and God has
[1:09:34] given us just like a basket that you
[1:09:36] come out of the grocery store with he's
[1:09:37] given us an assortment of all these
[1:09:39] things to manifest him in and make a
[1:09:41] real mature church at what is it what is
[1:09:43] it for a church where other people want
[1:09:46] to be
[1:09:47] around amen now that's the character of
[1:09:50] a real Christian that other people want
[1:09:52] to be around you
[1:09:55] the Le the cool leaves that you can
[1:09:57] crawl up under and get some shelter cool
[1:10:00] leaves of unity the the wind blowing
[1:10:02] through and the leaves are shaking and
[1:10:03] you hear that rustling in the trees uh
[1:10:06] don't you just love in maybe in the fall
[1:10:08] or the early spring you throw open the
[1:10:09] windows and you hear the leaves the wind
[1:10:11] rustling through the leaves and it just
[1:10:13] makes you feel home now that's that's
[1:10:15] what this bride tree is about a bride a
[1:10:17] bride tree where people feel welcome
[1:10:20] that they come and they can get shelter
[1:10:21] and they can get nourishment and they
[1:10:23] can get some peace and the bride tree
[1:10:25] and brother R said all nine gifts has
[1:10:27] got to be working in the
[1:10:29] church and all nine gifts have a
[1:10:32] relation to the nine the nine nine
[1:10:35] fruits they're related why because how
[1:10:38] you going to have wisdom without
[1:10:40] love how you going to have knowledge
[1:10:42] without
[1:10:43] Joy how you going to have faith without
[1:10:45] peace how you going to have healing
[1:10:47] without
[1:10:48] longsuffering how you going to have
[1:10:50] Miracles without gentleness and prophecy
[1:10:52] without goodness and discernment without
[1:10:54] meekness and everything goes hand in
[1:10:56] hand that the spirit of God pushing out
[1:10:58] pushing out all these gifts what it's a
[1:11:01] supernatural church not a natural and
[1:11:05] we'll find and and and we'll be closing
[1:11:07] in just a moment here I'm not going to
[1:11:08] wear you out this afternoon but brother
[1:11:10] Bram cautioned over and over stay away
[1:11:13] from the
[1:11:15] natural we don't want something natural
[1:11:18] something cold and formal something
[1:11:20] where we're just learning about it
[1:11:21] collecting information but we want a
[1:11:24] living message we want something that's
[1:11:26] living something where God is producing
[1:11:29] that's what I want to see and the nine
[1:11:31] fruits it what it all comes by the
[1:11:33] spirit of God just like in Psalm chapter
[1:11:35] 1 he shall be like a tree planted by the
[1:11:37] rivers of water that bringeth forth his
[1:11:39] fruit and his season his Leaf also shall
[1:11:42] not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall
[1:11:44] prosper it comes by the spirit so we
[1:11:47] need the spirit how do we get more
[1:11:49] spirit and I'm going to close with this
[1:11:52] if you want more of God if you want more
[1:11:54] of the SP Spirit more of the spirit
[1:11:56] moving in your life more of the spirit
[1:11:58] moving in your church if you want more
[1:12:00] of God come with an attitude of
[1:12:03] expectation amen that's
[1:12:08] right now come on now I'm not trying to
[1:12:11] be mean but honestly sometimes we come
[1:12:13] with an expectation to
[1:12:16] sleep where this is and I know you know
[1:12:19] it's a it's a good safe environment to
[1:12:21] get our nap in but if we change that and
[1:12:24] come with an expect of worship come with
[1:12:27] an attitude of expectation you know when
[1:12:30] we got in the car this morning we we
[1:12:32] come we didn't just come with our minds

[1:12:36] listening to music but we come listening
[1:12:38] to a sermon this morning you why cuz
[1:12:40] you're expecting oh and and that set
[1:12:42] that atmosphere we we were I think we we

[1:13:38] our mind is we're living we're living
[1:13:41] for the word we we it's all I want is
[1:13:43] the word and and we just we're I get up
[1:13:46] in the morning I hear the tape playing
[1:13:48] downstairs I all all I did yesterday was
[1:13:51] study study study and it seems like
[1:13:54] others are not drinking but I want to
[1:13:56] encourage you to drink if you are
[1:13:58] drinking and great but if you're not I
[1:14:00] want to encourage you to keep drinking
[1:14:02] and you can tell that's how you tell
[1:14:04] whether there's something real happening
[1:14:06] in somebody's life if they don't want
[1:14:08] the word there's something there's
[1:14:10] something wrong with that tree if
[1:14:12] they're not excited about the word
[1:14:15] listen I'm sorry for laying it out
[1:14:16] through straight and narrow but if you
[1:14:18] don't love the word if you don't love
[1:14:21] this message there's something wrong
[1:14:23] with your tree if you don't love it cuz
[1:14:26] that's how you grow and when you're born
[1:14:28] again something that on the inside
[1:14:31] changes to where it begins drawing you
[1:14:33] to the word and you got to have that
[1:14:36] word like a
[1:14:39] tree and you you're going to want that
[1:14:41] tree you don't to want that water you
[1:14:43] don't to want the water you you you
[1:14:44] can't you can't get away from it like a
[1:14:47] tree you a tree without
[1:14:49] water that's why standing outside you
[1:14:52] hear all the oldtimers we need rain we
[1:14:54] need rain cuz the trees are going to die
[1:14:56] if you don't get rain everything's going
[1:14:59] to die if you get don't get rain you got
[1:15:01] to have that
[1:15:02] water how do you want how do you get
[1:15:04] more of God surrender and yield yourself
[1:15:07] surrender die out to yourself and say
[1:15:10] Lord if there's anything wrong with me
[1:15:12] lay aside all our pride and all that Bo
[1:15:14] up well bless God you better not tell me
[1:15:16] nothing if we'll lay aside all that to
[1:15:19] where we can be told something then
[1:15:21] something will begin to happen in our
[1:15:22] lives and put all your dependence on the
[1:15:25] word of God all of your dependence pray
[1:15:29] and seek God's presence and walk in
[1:15:31] faith in positive confession and
[1:15:34] cultivate a desire for more of God and
[1:15:38] drink drink that water maybe we'll close
[1:15:41] with this you know a mature oak tree can
[1:15:43] consume 40,000 gallons or more per year
[1:15:47] 40,000 gallons that's 110 gallons a day
[1:15:52] just soaking up that water you put an
[1:15:54] oak next to a river a spring and it's
[1:15:57] just going to drink it all up as much as
[1:15:59] you can give me that's as much as I can
[1:16:01] take and you know I believe that that's
[1:16:03] a real Eagle that's that's the eagle
[1:16:05] anointing give me as much as you give me
[1:16:08] as much as meat as you can give give me
[1:16:11] as much water as you can give and I'm
[1:16:13] going to drink it up because that's what
[1:16:15] I need to survive and if you keep
[1:16:17] drinking you can't help but produce
[1:16:19] fruit you keep drinking and drinking and
[1:16:22] soaking it up and soaking it up and it's
[1:16:24] going to push out push out and push out
[1:16:26] and push out push out a loving peaceful
[1:16:30] gentle Meek life it's going to push out
[1:16:33] the character of Jesus Christ it's going
[1:16:35] to push out something real it's going to
[1:16:37] push out the devil it's going to be like
[1:16:39] that stature of a perfect man pushing
[1:16:41] out all the trash pushing it out all
[1:16:44] washing all that trash out until a
[1:16:46] genuine real character is revealed amen
[1:16:50] it's going to bring forth God's fruit in
[1:16:52] the season that the messenger is
[1:16:53] ordained to come and every every age God
[1:16:57] has ordained fruit God has ordained his
[1:17:00] word to be
[1:17:02] manifested what is it as the musicians
[1:17:04] come the fruit is a product of eternal
[1:17:08] life eternal life is down in the root of
[1:17:11] that tree and it pushes up and pushes up
[1:17:14] by drinking drinking drinking until it
[1:17:16] just pushes out a product of eternal
[1:17:19] life oh that's what I want to see as the
[1:17:22] as the product of eternal life working
[1:17:24] working in my life working in in
[1:17:27] Believers lives and all these worms all
[1:17:30] these spiritual things eat it down but
[1:17:32] God promised I will
[1:17:35] restore we got a promise there laying in
[1:17:37] the scripture that we can look
[1:17:39] at I will
[1:17:41] restore I wonder I wonder as we stand to
[1:17:44] our feet as a musicians maybe start
[1:17:45] playing
[1:17:47] softly maybe think this this afternoon
[1:17:50] is there what what has the devil taken
[1:17:51] from
[1:17:53] you what has the has the devil taken
[1:17:55] your
[1:17:57] joy has the devil taken your meekness
[1:17:59] your
[1:18:00] gentleness has he taken that Gentle
[1:18:02] Spirit Away From
[1:18:04] You has he taken your peace where you're
[1:18:07] wondering what's up and what's
[1:18:10] down maybe he's taking everything from
[1:18:13] you you know you can have it
[1:18:16] back the Bible says the floor shall be
[1:18:19] full of Wheat and the fat shall overflow
[1:18:22] with wine and
[1:18:23] oil he said I will restore to you all
[1:18:26] those years that the Locust hath eaten
[1:18:28] the cankerworm and the caterpillar and
[1:18:31] ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied
[1:18:33] and praise the name of the Lord your
[1:18:36] God oh that means that true worship be
[1:18:38] be restored you know you can't worship
[1:18:41] you can't worship right unless you're in
[1:18:44] God's provided place of
[1:18:46] worship when Jesus was talking to that
[1:18:48] little woman at the
[1:18:49] well she said we don't we worship over
[1:18:52] here in this mountain where where are
[1:18:53] you telling us to worship and he said
[1:18:55] the true worshipper will worship in
[1:18:57] spirit and in
[1:18:58] truth oh that's when true worship is
[1:19:00] restored when true truth is restored
[1:19:03] when you know what you believe in when
[1:19:06] you know that you've got it oh that's
[1:19:09] when you can really worship like Miriam
[1:19:11] when she come come across the Red Sea
[1:19:13] and she saw all those Egyptians washed
[1:19:15] away behind she took that tambourine out
[1:19:19] and she began to
[1:19:21] Rejoice oh church we got something to
[1:19:23] Rejoice about
[1:19:25] I wonder tonight if you if you need
[1:19:28] restoration why don't we just bow our
[1:19:30] heads bow our heads to the Earth from
[1:19:32] where we come
[1:19:34] from if you need restoration if you lift
