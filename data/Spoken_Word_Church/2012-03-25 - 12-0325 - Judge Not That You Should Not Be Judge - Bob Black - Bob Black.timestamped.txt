[0:05] get away from Genesis this morning and
[0:08] simply the last time we were talking
[0:10] about bacon capital punishment and
[0:14] judgment and everything I whole day
[0:16] going into the new testament toggled up
[0:20] to have the bride judges and the
[0:24] scripture made in Matthew 7 one judge
[0:27] not that ye be not judged and just kind
[0:32] of divide that up and go off the
[0:35] different pieces and look at all the
[0:36] different ways it pleased to be judged
[0:45] you know last time we're talking about
[0:47] taking vengeance and castle of
[0:49] punishment and I don't know if y'all
[0:51] heard but it was a sister in north
[0:53] carolina and joe canada send me a
[0:54] message that she had been shocked if he
[0:56] can't play her in church for four years
[0:58] or hype with orbitz us and they had a
[1:01] little tired shopping fella came in and
[1:05] asked for money she gave the money and
[1:06] he just turn around a shot she was a
[1:09] real good friend with brother Spencer so
[1:11] remember that family that's things like
[1:14] that are kind of hard to the time the
[1:17] thing about you but remember we have
[1:19] promised it if you missed a fee in one
[1:22] of god's little ones it's better for
[1:24] millstone running in and cast into the
[1:27] sea um so less yall already turn to
[1:34] Matthew 7 11 but instead of turning that
[1:36] lets trying to press for what first
[1:38] Corinthians 6 1 which is a scripture
[1:42] about home taking one another to you too
[1:47] long first Corinthians 6 longer dare you
[2:04] know you having a matter against another
[2:06] get along for the unjust and not before
[2:08] the Saints do you not know that the st.
[2:11] George is the world if the world should
[2:13] be judged by you are you a worthy to
[2:15] judge the smallest match no you know
[2:18] that we shall judge angels how much more
[2:21] things that pertain to this life and
[2:24] then you have judgments of things
[2:25] pertaining to this life said there to
[2:27] judge you at least the stand in the
[2:28] church because it'd be better for the
[2:31] least esteem in the church to judge you
[2:33] there to take it before the heathens of
[2:35] the world put it into it if you have any
[2:37] disagreements over things that otherwise
[2:39] you could take to court to be better for
[2:42] the very least in the church
[2:44] JG therefore even the judge I speak to
[2:47] your shame is it so that there is not a
[2:49] wise men among no not one that shall be
[2:52] able to judge when his brother but
[2:54] brother go with the law with brother and
[2:56] that before the unbelievers now
[2:58] therefore there is utterly a fall among
[3:00] you because you get a long one with
[3:02] another why do you not rather take Rome
[3:05] why do you not rather suffer yourselves
[3:08] to breathe to be defrauded see you can
[3:13] see that in the new and a new covenant
[3:16] that believer has the right to judge
[3:19] less so so now let's turn to Matthew 71
[3:36] get ready to turn to a lot of scriptures
[3:47] but sometimes things if you take just
[3:51] one verse it's hard to understand you've
[3:53] got to read it in context and look at
[3:55] almost every time when there's a
[3:57] scripture in the Bible it's hard to
[3:59] understand if you just expand your
[4:00] reading out a few verses and look at the
[4:03] context it becomes really clear what
[4:05] just be able to talk about 1971 if you
[4:08] take this first one by self judge not
[4:11] that ye be not judged well you could
[4:14] interpret that don't judge it all then
[4:15] you know like what her in the morning
[4:18] the word when we're about to go out my
[4:19] wife asked me if is her direct dress
[4:22] appropriate is a it's her dress too
[4:24] tight or Israel clothes not right and
[4:27] I'm judging that when we come into the
[4:30] house of the Lord that you know the
[4:32] Deaconess have to judge somebody's make
[4:35] the kids of misbehaving or what not we
[4:37] we're judging if you don't if you don't
[4:39] judge it all over the preacher wouldn't
[4:41] even have really anything to preach
[4:43] about so of course we're judging so
[4:47] let's you got to take this whole package
[4:49] of the from verse 12 verse five to
[4:52] really understand the scripture verse
[4:54] versus 224 kind of clarify and verse
[4:57] five ties it all together explains the
[5:00] real intent so let's read at all judge
[5:03] not that ye be not judged for with what
[5:05] judgment ye judge ye shall be judged and
[5:08] with what measure ye mete it shall be
[5:10] measured to you again and won't be hold
[5:12] us without a look that is in my
[5:14] consider is not the beam that is in that
[5:16] only I i I'm sure everybody understands
[5:20] that expression it's a way of saying if
[5:23] your if your brothers if you're trying
[5:25] to fix but tell you brother get that
[5:28] loss pick out of your eye but you got a
[5:30] great big old something that you write
[5:32] it doesn't make any sense for you to try
[5:35] to help your road get that thing out of
[5:36] his eye or how well they'll say to that
[5:39] brother let me pull out the mote out of
[5:40] thine eyes behold a beam is in thine own
[5:43] eye thou hypocrite first cast out the
[5:46] beam out of thine own eye and then shall
[5:48] that clearly see that this is the see
[5:51] clearly to cast out the mote out of thy
[5:52] brother's eye so that's the summation at
[5:56] first you make sure that you don't have
[5:58] a problem you can help your brother if
[6:00] he's got a problem with adultery or
[6:02] something like that is like that if you
[6:04] don't have the same problem get it out
[6:06] of your life first then you can begin
[6:08] again that's what a deacon is supposed
[6:11] to have his family or because how can I
[6:13] tell somebody to keep your kids a lot of
[6:15] my kids are in my way and I hope my kids
[6:17] are barking up let's see oh let's go to
[6:31] the first grade is in 215
[6:42] there's so many different ways that to
[6:45] work judges used in the New Testament
[6:47] and we're going to go to go through
[6:49] several level and look at how you should
[6:53] not judge and how you should use no but
[6:56] this one that one we're all for me you
[6:58] were either this spiritual judgeth all
[7:01] things yet he himself had judged of no
[7:03] man for whom have known the mind of the
[7:06] Lord that he instruction but we have the
[7:08] mind of Christ if you have the mind of
[7:10] Christ you got you know that in three
[7:14] last night for chapter in the church age
[7:16] book if you want to know that evidence
[7:17] of Allah goes well Brandon was using the
[7:19] Isaiah 54 13 and all that children shall
[7:23] be taller the Lord agree shall be the
[7:25] piece of our children because we need
[7:27] have the Holy Ghost God becomes Java
[7:29] brain state she remembers and teaches
[7:31] you that's why we can we have the Holy
[7:36] Ghost bill believer understand has
[7:38] understanding and if you don't have
[7:41] understanding then you can listen to
[7:43] what holy Joe still believe our sins and
[7:45] the way to conduct themselves and have
[7:46] no understanding all how can somebody
[7:48] this outside of Christ to understand and
[7:50] believer they look at us and think that
[7:52] we're we're odd and strange and like you
[7:57] you read for example John 11 it says the
[8:00] word with god and the word will God if
[8:03] you don't have one goes that's just
[8:05] you'll be on the understanding so I sent
[8:12] these notes to brother joke this morning
[8:15] through on a website and other I had a
[8:17] list of my notes if you want to download
[8:19] it later of all the sum up some
[8:21] scriptures that have different ways that
[8:23] the word does is used in first grade
[8:25] I'll turn into it but first Corinthians
[8:27] it
[8:27] is used to weigh carefully in form an
[8:29] opinion in Luke 743 it's used to infer
[8:33] or draw conclusions and John 1831 is
[8:37] used to put on the trial and enrollment
[8:39] 14-3 is used to despise as John 751 that
[8:43] was to condemn but let's take a look at
[8:45] the context of Matthew 7 this this is
[8:48] where the Sermon on the Mount and what
[8:53] Jesus is trying to get across is that
[8:55] they behavior of a Christian it's
[8:57] supposed to be radically different from
[8:59] the Jews oh he said except your
[9:02] righteousness cellex-c the righteousness
[9:03] of the scribes and Pharisees and the
[9:05] Pharisees early early I told you I are
[9:09] going to eternal up let's go to Luke 18
[9:13] 9 you know the same story is and matthew
[9:18] and luke and so even though we're
[9:22] switching to a different book it's this
[9:23] is earlier in the on our team Luke 18
[9:29] days and he's fake his parole under
[9:41] certain which trusted in themselves that
[9:43] they were righteous and despite dillards
[9:45] I sue me that's how he's referring to
[9:47] about the Pharisees the Pharisees
[9:49] regarded themselves some highly and they
[9:51] had complete contempt for anybody that
[9:53] wasn't like them they passed judgment
[9:54] upon everybody else while they were
[9:56] blind on their own faults oh let's turn
[10:01] to Romans to
[10:19] 221
[10:30] now they're force teaches to another
[10:32] teacher still not myself dr. preaches a
[10:34] man should not steal the stuff still now
[10:37] let's say its demands do not commit
[10:39] adultery just not commit adultery down
[10:41] at a Forest idle just alchemists oculus
[10:44] now they make a stop boast of the law
[10:47] through breaking along just owners that
[10:50] God for the name of God is blasting
[10:53] among the Gentiles through you because
[10:54] it is written and it so he he's just
[10:58] continuing the thought don't judge
[11:02] hypocritically and so then I want to
[11:10] look at the different categories of
[11:13] judging and how you should not do it
[11:15] first of all there's a public judgment
[11:18] that a sleazy a circle judgment where
[11:21] the preacher is trying to poker and
[11:22] judges by marching scene and rebuke you
[11:25] people in priority if it's necessary and
[11:29] you know like this this series of always
[11:31] doing his brothers judgment upon our
[11:33] family higher and we should we should
[11:38] really take the heart I really enjoy
[11:40] thats been a blessing to me and it's
[11:43] better to be judged by a certain of God
[11:47] that to be judged by God because then if
[11:51] your life is not ordering a you go and
[11:53] take communion then bus while many are
[11:56] sick and sleep my money you know theme
[12:00] so it's actually a blessing to be judged
[12:03] by the certainly are Oh in the house of
[12:07] God where desma Starks and brother
[12:10] Brennan talked about the case bunny as a
[12:13] type of church because um they care
[12:17] about leading said there was a well that
[12:21] had seven branches well that
[12:24] and that type to the well the water of
[12:28] life that goes out into the the churches
[12:31] where we receive judgment he said how
[12:37] can I overcome but when we come here we
[12:39] are here for one specific purpose
[12:49] greater than Solomon is here he said
[12:51] they followed him today come to a place
[12:53] called Kadesh Barnea the judgment seat
[12:56] of the world there was one great spring
[12:58] with several little tributaries which we
[13:00] can go in at each other we have time
[13:01] next when one that was where the waters
[13:03] of life goods from the throne to the
[13:06] churches and so forth but it was the
[13:08] judgment and judgment begins at the
[13:10] house of God and you know what happened
[13:13] to catch party and then we're presented
[13:15] with a choice and we're presented a
[13:17] choice here but a choice when we hear
[13:19] the word to believe it for to turn it
[13:21] away to accept it or to segment the
[13:24] promises of God are not truth PVE him
[13:29] God don't entertain people even beauty
[13:32] judgment begins at the house of God when
[13:35] it comes to the time that the church has
[13:37] to have soup suppers and dances and
[13:39] bunker games and all kinds of nonsense
[13:41] of Rome shell to visit preacher God have
[13:43] mercy on that church
[13:49] and that scripture is in first Peter 460
[13:53] I'll just read it yeah if any man
[13:59] suffered as a Christian let him not be
[14:01] ashamed but let him glorify God but the
[14:05] time has come that judgment must begin
[14:07] at the house of God and if it first
[14:09] begin at us what shall the end of them
[14:11] that are being what shall be the end of
[14:14] them that they not think I from God the
[14:18] second Timothy 4 14 he says Paul said I
[14:22] charge thee therefore before God and the
[14:25] Lord Jesus Christ he shall judge the
[14:26] quick and the dead as his appearing and
[14:28] his kingdom preach the word be instant
[14:31] in season out of season reprove rebuke
[14:33] exhort with all long-suffering and
[14:35] doctrine but the time will come when
[14:37] they will not endure sound doctrine but
[14:39] after their own lusts they shall heap to
[14:41] themselves teachers having itching years
[14:45] now
[14:48] the next time I'm judgment is civil
[14:50] government let's turn to Romans 13
[15:02] ah
[15:06] let every soul be subject unto the
[15:08] higher power well there is no power but
[15:12] of God the powers that be are ordained
[15:15] of God this is a good reason not to be
[15:19] worried about all the elections and
[15:20] thanking comfy if you you know if you
[15:23] started my job and go to my balls and
[15:26] they go up to the mayor and go up to the
[15:28] keep going pump up eventually going to
[15:30] get to God because God is over
[15:32] everything and I kind of like to say I
[15:37] vote on my heat because you know well
[15:41] that if I keep talking about that I
[15:44] guess any local though whosoever
[15:48] therefore resisteth the power resisteth
[15:50] the ordinance of God and they that
[15:51] resist shall receive to themselves
[15:53] damnation for rulers are not a terror to
[15:57] good works for to the yield but I'll
[15:59] they're not be afraid of the power do
[16:01] that which is good and I shall have
[16:03] prayed of the same for he is the
[16:05] minister of God me for good but if I do
[16:08] that which is evil be afraid for he
[16:10] beareth not the sword in vain
[16:12] God a revenger to execute wrath upon him
[16:15] that do with evil rulers are not a tear
[16:20] in good works but to the evil God sets
[16:27] them and gives them power of us lucky
[16:30] like you compound would have any power
[16:32] and what I'm giving you by God right so
[16:35] I'm not going to talk about that very
[16:38] much because of what we're talking about
[16:40] I just wanted to briefly mention it what
[16:42] we're talking about it and Matthew judge
[16:44] not that you do not judge let's now
[16:45] let's go to private judgment where one
[16:48] man in a Christian manner represents
[16:50] another for his sins was turned to
[16:52] Leviticus 19 7
[17:07] EG
[17:14] Oh next week 17
[17:21] I shall not hate thy brethren in
[17:23] neihardt now shot in any wise rebuke
[17:26] that neighbor and not suffer sin upon
[17:35] proverbs 27
[17:57] this is one that that sting a little bit
[18:01] open rebuke is better than secret love
[18:06] okay that's that's really too sure if I
[18:09] have a problem off our I brother
[18:11] somebody's telling let's read the next
[18:13] one two faithful are the ones that are
[18:14] playing but the kisses of an enemy are
[18:16] deceitful
[18:23] this is kind of a crass way to explain
[18:26] but I had when I was in high school
[18:28] while saying I played the trumpet in a
[18:31] band I had a little friend next to me
[18:33] that we were on every time you have I'd
[18:37] have something in my nose pointed out
[18:40] and she liked this thing just be glad it
[18:44] with your friend that is a crass way
[18:49] he's playing much but it's better for
[18:52] one of your friends to point a fallout
[18:54] then if it's where you see my point oh
[19:09] the next the next little topic is a
[19:13] waste that we should not judge we should
[19:17] not judge we're talking about judging
[19:19] not that you be not judged don't judge
[19:22] outside of your side of your business
[19:26] I'll just read this because these are
[19:29] first set Thessalonians 4 11 that you
[19:33] studied to be quiet and to do your own
[19:35] business and to work with your own hands
[19:38] as we commanded you the first Peter for
[19:41] 15 but let none of you suffer as a
[19:43] murderer or as a thief or as an evil to
[19:47] work or as a busybody another
[19:49] matters there we all know the example of
[19:52] getting on the telephone and judging
[19:57] want to know to our friends and it's
[19:59] right that all that does is it blew up
[20:02] bitterness with gossip yes oh don't
[20:10] judge presumptuously that's a passing
[20:14] judgment on most of another without
[20:15] without any of us that's what we do a
[20:18] lot of time on the phone yes just
[20:21] presumptuously let's go Romans 14 for
[20:54] Oh
[21:04] who are they all that judgest another
[21:06] man servant to his own master he
[21:10] standeth or palo tal be home for God's
[21:12] they're doing Houston this is just
[21:15] talking about let's go let's go up to
[21:21] verse 43 let splitting not let not him
[21:23] that Edith describes him that either not
[21:26] and let not him what he is not judge him
[21:29] that yet for God has received him and a
[21:32] good example explain this is this is may
[21:37] be controversial but the Christmas tree
[21:39] somebody has a Christmas tree if someone
[21:42] wants to have a Christmas tree don't do
[21:43] it week and images code they got a
[21:45] Christmas tree somebody doesn't want to
[21:46] have a Christmas tree don't condemn them
[21:48] go they don't have good tree because
[21:51] we're all serving God throughout it just
[21:54] another main service in his own mastery
[21:55] standards or false yeah he shall be
[21:58] holding up for god is able to make you
[22:00] stain these peas limit forgot don't
[22:02] judge him over something like that now
[22:03] I'll make a better example is and joke
[22:06] one that don't turn I was reading in Joe
[22:09] 192 level where the devil presumptuously
[22:12] a huge job of fearing God for personal
[22:15] gain not its enclosure this sickness to
[22:20] the lore that said dust joke fear of God
[22:21] for no that's not now made in hays about
[22:25] him in about his house and about all
[22:27] that he has on every side thou has
[22:29] blessed the work of his hands and his
[22:31] substance is increased in the land but
[22:33] put forth idea now touch all that he
[22:35] hath and he will curse thee to thy face
[22:38] police saying judges this in it for
[22:41] personal gain but wasn't it personal
[22:44] gains in it for love he loved God
[22:51] hypocritically don't judge a few
[22:54] yourself or guilty the Romans too I
[22:59] think we already read this I'll just
[23:02] read it therefore that already excusable
[23:04] old man who square without art that
[23:06] judges for wearing our judges to another
[23:08] now condemn us i sell for thou that
[23:10] judgest doest the same things David the
[23:14] sea and I the example I like to use this
[23:19] is at work we always kind of get kicked
[23:22] out people at benefit in up I work at a
[23:25] law firm and everyone's awesome i was
[23:27] absolutely blew their top and rant rave
[23:31] and everything that is a very good sign
[23:32] that they themselves i'm not doing their
[23:36] work when somebody starts pointing
[23:41] fingers everybody else it is so true if
[23:44] they got a three point back to them and
[23:48] we we kind of get a kick out of that
[23:51] work everybody here that's been very
[23:54] true therefore without RX inexcusable oh
[23:58] man who sort without our that judge for
[24:00] wearing not just another doctor him as
[24:01] myself without that judges do us the
[24:04] same things and remember enough
[24:08] historian second saying or david accused
[24:10] the rich man Nathan the Prophet came to
[24:13] him and he said he's told the story or
[24:14] the rich man stole the poor man's land
[24:17] which was Bathsheba and David in
[24:20] realized and David said he needs to be
[24:22] punished for that when he himself more
[24:25] air with it Nathan wasn't telling story
[24:27] about land David David was guilty of a
[24:29] much greater sin than just
[24:31] later he was pointing fingers he don't
[24:35] do that make full proof performance
[24:42] assuming the worse than someone Genesis
[24:44] 11 5 the Lord came down to see the tire
[24:47] that the people built the Tower of Babel
[24:49] he came down himself and justice 18-21
[24:53] he said I will do down now Sodom and
[24:55] Gomorrah because he wanted to see John
[24:59] 724 says judge not according to the
[25:02] appearance but judge righteous judgment
[25:04] because sometimes a lot of times things
[25:06] on the outside or not I know you can
[25:10] judge somebody that you think is doing
[25:11] wrong while they might be it's been in
[25:14] there knocks praying for you proverbs 18
[25:18] he's an answer is a matter before you
[25:20] hear that it is all I had shame unto him
[25:23] and then the last one is uh
[25:28] unwarrantable judgment because in gods
[25:31] were there some things that are
[25:33] commended and there's some things that
[25:34] are condemned oh there's another thing
[25:38] there's another there's a lot of things
[25:40] that aren't there's nothing really said
[25:42] about them like Christmas trees oh
[25:45] please yes t 7 16 it says be not a
[25:48] righteous / much needed to make thyself
[25:51] over wise why should establish destroy
[25:55] thyself and you know people people make
[25:58] up I hope that's done a fitting and one
[26:02] of other people that they make a great
[26:04] rules are for the children don't play
[26:06] any games with dice or it's a sin to
[26:09] play a board game with dice or to have a
[26:12] board game of cards and didn't make all
[26:15] these extra rules there aren't really
[26:19] there's nothing really in the model that
[26:21] it's kind of unwarranted judgment and
[26:24] then you judge up people because they
[26:26] play a board game with dice and center
[26:27] they're not a Christian or whatever but
[26:31] going back to the other or if you want
[26:33] if you feel it in your heart that you
[26:35] shouldn't play a board game with dice if
[26:38] you believe in that scene and you do it
[26:40] anyway you know about says that sin to
[26:43] you if you do it without faith we're
[26:48] almost 14 7 for the kingdom of God is
[26:50] not meat and drink but righteousness and
[26:53] peace and joy and Allah gift James 411
[27:00] sorry Jacob let's go ahead and turn to
[27:04] that game 4 11
[27:26] change for live-ins is talking about one
[27:29] unwarranted accusation you make where
[27:31] you just kind of invent a new law for
[27:33] your brother to follow speak not evil
[27:35] one of another brother and he just
[27:37] speaketh evil of his brother and judges
[27:38] the brother is speaketh evil of the law
[27:40] judges the law but if thou just a laulau
[27:43] are not a doer of the law for the judge
[27:45] and colossus to 2023 else I'll just read
[27:48] it wherefore if he be dead with Christ
[27:50] and the rudiments of the world why the
[27:52] living in the world and you subject to
[27:54] ordinances touch not taste not handle
[27:57] knock which are all to perish with using
[27:59] after the commandments and doctors for
[28:00] me which things have indeed a show of
[28:04] wisdom and will worship and humility and
[28:06] neglecting of the body not many honor to
[28:08] satisfy my flesh
[28:15] now
[28:20] so we were looking at judge not that ye
[28:22] be not judged now remember you're
[28:25] supposed to judge yourself so you don't
[28:28] judge others hypocritically and we judge
[28:30] ourselves so it will not be judged by
[28:32] God in second chronicles don't turn I'll
[28:37] just read it 7 13 14 God said if I
[28:40] should up ever there be no rain or if I
[28:42] command the locusts to the power of the
[28:43] land or if i send pestilence among my
[28:45] people my people which are called by my
[28:48] name shall humble themselves and pray
[28:49] and seek my face and turn from their
[28:52] wicked ways then will I hear from heaven
[28:53] and will forgive their sin and will hear
[28:56] their land heal their land and the
[28:59] Corinthians have been guilty of turning
[29:02] communion into a feast if you judge
[29:05] yourself and God will you if you don't
[29:07] know yourself then will be judges first
[29:10] Corinthians 11 29 first a good way to
[29:13] remember their scriptures that there's
[29:14] three pillars 14 Corinthians 11 and in
[29:18] first Corinthians 11 is the scriptures
[29:20] about women wear hair and also by
[29:23] communion yes that's a good way to
[29:25] remember three pillars first Corinthians
[29:26] 11 for he that Edith and drinketh
[29:28] unworthily Ethan drinketh damnation to
[29:30] himself and not just learning boy's body
[29:32] this calls many are weak and sickly
[29:34] money in their measly four if we were
[29:37] jumped with judge ourselves we should
[29:39] not be judged but when we are judged we
[29:41] are chasing of the lower than we should
[29:43] not be condemned with the world now I
[29:46] just wrote some notes from this little
[29:49] pamphlet this little booklet that
[29:51] brother Gordon Lindsey put out divine
[29:53] healing and the brand of campaigns and
[29:56] it's but a brand road forward I'm just
[30:00] going to read this real quick just to
[30:01] show that program actually read this and
[30:03] he said I personally requested those who
[30:05] come for healings you carefully read and
[30:07] study this booklet along with their
[30:09] Bible if there should be any one who
[30:10] cannot afford a small cost to personally
[30:12] request a copy of you giving that person
[30:14] but there's just a little quote I wanna
[30:18] read in core up the church have been
[30:22] seriously Bob divided there are
[30:23] differences of doctrine differences
[30:25] matter of leadership differences in the
[30:28] matter of water baptism these
[30:29] differences have produced contentions
[30:31] and divisions in the body of Christ but
[30:33] Paul remonstrated says Christ divided
[30:35] evidently the Corinthian church did not
[30:37] discern the horse body discern the
[30:39] Lord's body means to know that God is
[30:41] living in unities tabernacle in your
[30:43] flesh if you don't have that revelation
[30:45] then you're not discerning the Lord's
[30:46] body don't take the chameleon without
[30:49] discerning that he's living in you
[30:50] better miss Bell with you as a
[30:53] result meeting where we can sickly and
[30:55] many slept in death and the penalty of
[30:58] such division and lack of discernment
[31:00] was sickness and premature death what
[31:02] was true in the Corinthian church is
[31:03] true to a great extent today we must
[31:05] discern the Lord's body which is his
[31:07] church before we might banish sickness
[31:09] from our doors stop
