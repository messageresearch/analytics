Description:
1) 62-1122  RETURN.AND.JUBILEE_  SHREVEPORT.LA  THURSDAY_
«  E-20       †        Now, if somehow or other the individual lost their inheritance that was given to them by God, there come a year called the jubilee year. And that was... Every seven years they had a--a rest, a sabbath. Every seven days they had a sabbath, every seven years they had a sabbath. And seven sabbaths was forty-nine years, and the fiftieth year was jubilee.
    And in this jubilee every man that had lost his inheritance by some means... If he was a freeborn and a true blooded Israelite, no matter who held the possession, it had to go back to him free. He didn't have to pay a thing; he didn't have to do a thing, but just stop what he was doing and go back to his inheritance.
    Oh, my. He had a right to it. It was a God-given right. Because he, by grace, had inherited it, and it would--been given to his fathers and handed down year after year. No matter what had taken place, if he lost it, it must go free. It meant grace is way provided for each individual to return to their rightful inheritance.

2) 54-1003E  JUBILEE.YEAR_  JEFFERSONVILLE.IN  V-26 N-6  SUNDAY_
«  55       †        Now, they would sell a slave. Then this--this girl here, now, she can go out and be a wife, or she can be a handsmaid. They sell her, look at her teeth, see how strong she is, whether she can work or not, or if she's a virgin or not, and so forth. And you can buy them, get as many as you want, many as you can take care of, many as you can pay for.
    And now, the same thing was in the days of the Lord, when they took a slave and sold it. Then, every seven years there was a jubilee year come by. Now, this was a great time, and it has a great significance to the people of today: Great time.

«  57       †        Now, the slaves would be in the field, or wherever they was, at work, and then maybe bent down under the load of the taskmaster, the owner. And he was full lord and master over them, because he had a legal pa...

goodness of the Lord in the land of the living wait on the Lord be of good courage and he shall strengthen thine heart wait I say on the Lord god bless you be seated the whole chapter is full of faith nuggets every time the devil tries to come that you just read that chapter so many promises yeah I remember I heard a testimony one time of how I was a lady she was an orphan and she couldn't understand why our parents gave her up and those kind of things and she came across a Bible and started to read in that verse 10 when my father and mother forsake me then the Lord will take me up that's what took her to Christ she gave her heart to Christ and she found her true mother and father amen I saw in him open the eyes of my heart Lord yes open the eyes of my heart for I want to see

[Music] amen amen amen he said if we wanted to see we would see him good to see everybody the house of the Lord you'd like to read your scriptures turn to Leviticus 25 we've been reading from try to bring the thought closer to the end today and move on a little bit this afternoon and I remember the fellowship meeting will be at brother Longoria's on the third Saturday not this coming Saturday but the next one so remember that and brother Aaron will be ministering the Lord willing is coming Wednesday so remember that we got to view Wade last night in the Philippines of course we had a lot of you know third Saturday we got we'll get that part anyway but we got to view Wade last night and we got to buffer a lot so we got a lot of Steel pictures you know there's sometimes five minutes wait until they led work out and do but we did get to watch the service he's done a great job ministering on adoption the people seem to be overjoyed about the message in things and there's moving on and keep it going on and on so you know just print the Lord would bless him they're gonna be flying some gotta fly from one place to another and then fly back and then be some more services and also prayer to the Lord would bless him he was really moving pretty fast last night and I thought oh man if I tried to move out of way and holler I wouldn't have no voice after about two days and I'd be whispering but he can he can take it and make it work so just pray that the Lord would bless all right anything else eleven o'clock seven o'clock anybody wants to go we'll all try to get together do whatever we can work to do together you've already heard brother dicks doing better we appreciate God being with him and and everything taking care of him through that heart attack and all of the things that he did have a mild one and then they put some stents in they got to do some more later but just keep praying for him it's Lord would would make everything to be all right okay remember the others that are sick Holy Father we thank you for this day your love your understanding your grace your guidance thank you for you we just ask you to Lord to help us to be what you want us to be because that's our desire more than anything else is to follow in your example your footprints your love and your grace and let it all Lord be for your honor and glory we read your word because we know that that word is true and we just ask you to open it so that we can see it we can read the words off the page but yet without the Holy Ghost in our hearts to reveal it it's worth nothing to us but we pray that you just got each one member weighed our ministry and the things traveling take care of him remember all this the ones here that are sick and just let your loving grace be there we love you and we thank you in Jesus name Amen I want to keep reading this until you get the thought of what we're trying to bring you know not just trying to talk about a date or a time or a season or anything we put a couple of services on 77 and it has been very well received on the internet because we've jumped by double connections for the amount of time so maybe somebody's listening and they can can hear and understand but we don't want to leave anything to her it would be dangling to where they wouldn't understand us so we try to express things in a way that will you know carry on and and be a benefit to each one like brother Brown said now these things it's very very uh you know for the hour and the time says the great significance to the people of this day because see if we see these things we can see Redemption I was listening to the message over a couple of times hour and a watching the point of layout see it to see redemption in the Old Testament is to just simply look at his word and read it there's no holy ghost Dyer to give you a new birth we know that but yet still all it was done and all was done and said for our honor and glory that they done that to where we could see what we need for this day so then that way we follow that and it leads out you know to the right way okay and the Lord spake unto Moses in mount sinai saying speak unto the children of Israel and say unto them when you come into the land which I give you then shall the land keep a Sabbath unto the Lord six years shall die so thy field and six years shall die prune thy vineyard and gather in the fruit thereof but in the seventh year shall be a Sabbath of rest unto the land a Sabbath for the Lord thou shalt neither sow thy field are pruned i vineyard they which growth of its own accord of the harvest I shall not reap remember how we was explaining you don't reap you because you're not to try to he's supposed to give you on the sixth double for the part to take care of the seventh so you don't when you come to the seventh you can't go out and reap and sell it or store it up you don't need to because God has given you what is needful to take care of it alright and the Sabbath of the land shall be meat to you for thee and for thy servant and for that maid and for the hired servant and for thy stranger and Sojourner so that sojourneth with thee and for thy cattle and for the beasts in the field shall all the increase there of the meat thou shalt number now watch it seven Sabbath's of years unto thee seven times seven years in a space of seven Sabbath's of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years then shalt thou cause the jubilee of the trumpet of the Jubilee to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month in the day of atonement they even put it right to the date now so you make the trumpet sound throughout all your land and you shall hallow the fiftieth year and proclaim Liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof it shall be a jubilee unto you and you shall return every man unto his possession and you shall return every man unto his family and you may be seated the Lord had his blessing to the reading of the word now I know that maybe sometimes you get bored by me repeating myself you can count it for old age to do what you want to but I was repeating myself when I was thirty years old trying to preach as much as I probably more than I do now you know because that's been my point is to something repetitive you know eventually it will fall into your memory enough to be able to see what's going on all right see then you say well do we need this well let me ask you a question what you gonna do you gonna go home eat drink and be merry and just sit around wait oh we know the Lord's come in the allottee we're just glad you know but see that doesn't work we've been here for a reason we're here today for a reason all right everything's right on time the Prophet said there's nothing cater they don't look like it but we're here for that time but when you get into understanding your scriptures you can see we're here exactly to fulfill the Scriptures all right and then following that see then we can follow and see right where we're at and what we're doing in this day okay now we've been talking about you know not to to do anything but just you know some people say you're just packing that down on me cause you keep repeating it well if you say that then there's something wrong with you that's the best way to say it leave it to her all right most everybody when you talk about something that we read here of the Jubilee and you talk of a Jubilee to most religious people and and they'll say well the fiftieth that's the Jubilee the 50th oh yeah we got 250 with well alright that's well and good then you've got your fiftieth that's what it means what it means it goes to the number eight and occurs it over to eternity yes but now what are you going to type with in other words if you take the 50 and that's all you can follow through the Bible where she types and shadows because the 50 is not a type of anything just remember that one point the one little thing to think on the message if you don't get nothing there remember a 50 it's not a type the number 8 is not a type you're not typing this typing that thing there's there's no way you turn it to his eternity and you don't type with eternity what would you type you know are you listening what would you type if you tried to use the word eternity so then you totally annihilate the whole Old Testament right now listen I'm saying in you denial eight Matthew Mark Luke and John the Lord Jesus and his message because you today say I don't need that see that's where we it's so hard to try to comprehend some things maybe but you know just think on it you realize when the Lord Jesus was here he was under came under the law to redeem them that were under the law you know he kept the law you know he told him to go when he would heal them he tell him go show yourself to Moses or you know that I mean the the priests they'll show yourself as Moses had commanded the priesthood you know and he he was under the law until the day of Pentecost you know are the resurrection coming for his part all right see then he entered into the situation that could bring the interview but yet he spoke of the things that's what's so marvelous to me I don't understand I'm sorry maybe I expect too much or something I don't know but I thought we were supposed to be Bible readers you know I thought we had our emphasis upon the Word of God you know I thought the message was I had brought that to our understanding that we valued the word above where we were reading it before when we read it before we were reading it to maybe get a gold star maybe to show how many times we can say we've read the Bible some kind of a selfish motive to me I read the Bible but then when coming into the message and hearing the Prophet expound upon that word then the Bible itself become alive I thought that's what the message was to do I thought that's what the profit came to do was to bring us to a place to see the alive word living in us that's why I emphasized so much that we live in a present tense we don't live in the pies we don't live in the future we live in the present tense now listen to what I'm saying you may not agree with this but you know that the basics of most religion either lives in the past or the future I mean you just consider their thoughts and their doings and everything and they living that in the Pais to the future all right but see we're supposed to be present tense eternal life so there was the whole Old Testament as tops and shadows okay then the Lord Jesus come and look how marvelous it marvelous it was go you say to most people you know they turned to the first book of the New Testament where were you gonna turn we return to Matthew that's not the first book of the New Testament New Testament wasn't in in making at the time of Matthew or now it was but time he wrote it down but you know what I'm saying the things that were spoke of in Matthew Mark Luke and John even the master himself was still under the law he had to come according to the law he couldn't break that law he couldn't do that because he was the word himself all right see then he had to come to bring it to a place that you could move it from tops and shadows toward a reality now within him within the being we call Jesus was eternal life right that was the the thing that you know did you talk about to be the 50 or the eight of eternity he already had that he didn't have to receive that he was that see then he stands between the Old Testament and the New Testament and see then the first book of the New Testament is what the book of Acts kotas the Holy Ghost in the church and the Holy Ghost in the church you're you're not under the law Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to them that believe all right see then those types and shadows back there they had to be there for our understanding and like I said the Prophet is read he said these things have a great significance for us down here in the end time why because we're supposed to be the people that the end of all things has come upon all right we're not down to the age of just trying to learn this study that do this that or the other we're at the age of trying to get to be a reality into our hearts and lives all right and see then it may sound odd to keep doing but yet here comes a prophet and he's preaching and he brings these things out for us the Lord Jesus kept those Sabbath's he kept those things in times he lived according to what they had he went to church on the day that they went to church he done the things that they was to do or not do on the Sabbath but it was what it was the seventh day all right it was not any turn at that time it was a seventh day so in that Old Testament when you're reading that God works six days and rested the seventh they read Paul and his studies of that and you can look back and see what took place all right see those things then were for our being to to bring us to a place that we could understand the you maybe you don't pay attention to or or think about it as I do in the basis of how perfect the Word of God is it is so beautiful to read it and to realize what it's talking about and the thing we can understand it you know what I'm talking about we were we were back there a lot of us biggest portion of us back in organized religion we had no concept or thoughts of a living God in a reality and of right our president oh yeah we believed he was a healer we believe that you were Savior we believe these things but did we believe in a reality of Christ living to fulfill the god of the word well who did you serve back there I've done the best of service I could the god that I believed in but yet coming into the message then that God I've told you things I've seen God things that happen I wanted to see God I wanted to see that God that I read of in the word that I looked around and could not find and we were doing good I mean you know things were happening but yet see one day when a prophet begin to speak and I heard him talking about the word so simple that I could understand it all at once something started changing and I wasn't even born again so don't don't go say what I got morning in it that's wonderful I wasn't we get to Bible become alive to me as I begin to read and see how this represents this and this represents this scent and listen to that prophet until it was just you know just amazing to hear him speak of the simplicity of the things that we couldn't figure out yet he would bring it out so simple until I could understand it it made the word come from letters on the page to reality in a human being at least I could see one time I could know there was one man could understand might not have been made might not pass tellers but I knew one thing for sure this man understood what he's talking about and he talked to the God that I wanted to see he talked of a God that I wanted to you know to come to some relationship as you'd call it with he spoke of the new birth so simple until it was just amazing yet it was exactly what the Bible had said he didn't come to change it to make it work he come to get us to see it at her already said it alright see then you've got to have your tops in your shadows but remember in your tops in your shadows be careful don't just lay it down oh that's just the type of son it has great meanings to it when the day of Pentecost was fully come you realize the Holy Ghost couldn't come before them I mean a year before the end they had a Jew police they had times they had side Bush they had all kind of things they work six years arrested itself right but still they never could come to a reality of something within their heart not they never could come to a rest that they knew it was spoke up then is knowing that then you can see that those things back there they had a meaning to you and me they were done a certain way to be for us you know and said their lies not listening to wait ministering and this mind running back into the Bible and in thinking about it you know of what he was talking about in at once part of talking about that God is a moving God you know he never stops he's never steal he's moving because that's really the understanding of life is a constant moving not necessarily moving this way but a constant you know movement our advancement and I would my mind was going back into the Old Testament when it would go back there and I'd see those children of Israel as they journeyed and went through and a setting like this you know I was tied up into that while he was preaching and thinking about you know that in Ezekiel when he saw the wheel in the middle of the wheel and he saw the children of Israel in journey well yet it was shown in as an example of a wheel running in the middle of a wheel you know a movement as your religion died on you because if it ever stops it will there's no such thing in God is standing still there is no such thing you said well brother I've been having trouble I'm just standing still now no your back slid just admit it your back slid because you stopped if you stopped God's moving on you want to quote from brother Branham work that Martin Luther called the pillar of fire and he said he moved on well you know when they begin to die down and everything brother Brennan would say and Wesley caught that pillar of fire in a way he went God has always been in movement form it's never just a standing still alright then think about the opening of God's Word as it constantly unveils and you'll see what I'm trying to describe of a god that's reality of life and moving the revelation never stops whether you get to the afternoon services and in this thing see it never stops it's the constant movement it never ends is it going to end we have three sons name right sort of man son of God son of David alright son of David isn't is the throne in the Millennium right Jesus sits on the throne is that the end of it does that end it all no it's makes ready for the future home our eternity because the millennium has not Eterne at this time it's a thousand years but then you come to so what are you going to go with our with you know what are you gonna take son of God son of man son of God son of David there's a lot more to the Word of God than just to take statements like that and say well I see it we got it son of God a son of man Becker son of God we understand that now and in the Millennium be son of David or does it go from there it's got to be in the Bible it's got to be in the prophets message where do we go from dire is there another son's night to come into be it's a constant moving it never ends we go I love the wording when I read that - probably he said that God would give us a message of cheer down through the endless ages after life is over after all of these things after the Millennium and you enter the future home are you gonna enter the future home and just stop learning oh we just come to an end as far as we can go to give you an example I was thinking or something the other day this is funny Carla carnal but I thank him you know the world's getting pretty crowded seven billion people now you go to some of these countries and and they just living on top of each other just stacked up almost you know and I mean you just bumping into pushing and shoving and going and then even a little bit I've been you you realize that that they're just masses of people you know well when you get to the future home we got seven billion now you get to the future home how many people are you gonna have what if you just have the seven billion what if he's just out seven billion it's still gonna be crowded you understand him it's gonna be crowded see we don't think about here when we're getting the car and drive 80 miles to get to go to a grocery store or something yeah I mean at least 15 miles or something with these going to Atlanta downtown you'd have to drive we don't think we don't think about you go overseas until you just packed up on one another I was thinking about that I thought Lord what's gonna happen you know what this is the thought that came to him in so you say is Carla's crazy you know we talked about the Big Bang Theory of the creation all right everything flung off the Sun that it's just Bly stood out and you know particles are metal or whatever you want to call different things that went in ever direction and you got this planets beyond planets beyond planets and and you got places out there that that there's so big until you could put a half a dozen Earth's on that one chunk of metal or whatever floating around I think you know what if God just called it all back not back to the burning Sun the only gonna go carnal what did he just call back all those planets and put them back together you know you're saying your kids you come through you study didn't and a lot of those planets out there that are way under bigger than we are what if you brought them all back together you don't have to worry about how many people they'll be there right you understand my point you don't have to worry about how many people is gonna be there cuz he can bring it all back together and have millions of worlds called you know as we go out through space we're finding out that it's just beyond our it just keeps on going to all kinds of planets and and different things you know you just put all that back together you have a big old flight I'm charging them for that what I'm just thinking that that's our coronal I think cuz I really I I like to think things over and I do I like to just think about things as it is it's unveil to me and that's why I guess maybe that I spend so much time to you know trying to get you to see it and help us to understand alright now let's go see then we read here in Leviticus that there's a Sabbath every seven years all right there's a Jubilee never seven years but you believe is a release right so then ever seven years you had a release and you went seven seven seven seven - do you come to seven times that and you come to a 49 all right the next is a fifty well we say well well the fifties the Jubilee now you don't have 7g believes to get to a fifty no matter how you try to calculate that turning over to a fifty or turning over to the first one back or are the eight you know being than one and the things like that remember all that is is for understanding to see how mathematically correct everything is alright but you can't argue the point because we went through the Bible in the you know in Exodus and Deuteronomy 's and the things like that showing it and gave where the Prophet was covering that there was a Jubilee ever seven years there was arrests ever seven years we went through that there was arrest on like a Sabbath because that comes from the old day the Millennium the Prophet said God's going to have a millennium to show the sin curse is gone because the sin curse we fell in the seventh day right God worked six days rest in the seventh we fell in the rest all right we didn't fall in the eighth cuz ain't no way of falling from an eight because that's eternity all right you got your Sabbath you rest okay so then you dressed every seventh day you dressed every seventh year all right and then you'd have a marvelous situation facing you that you got to rest for each seven years you know and like I said you take a person and they're going to bondage to you and at the end of that period of time that brother is going to let you go free but he's not gonna send you out empty-handed I wish we could follow it like that it's not just the coming up of time you know and slavery's and things it's an example of slavery now let me ask you a simple question when Israel was in bondage to Egypt making bricks now I'm asking you a simple question to be this plain language when they were in bondage to Egypt did they rest the Sabbath day did you take the Sabbath day off did they give a rest of over seven years now they were all in bondage are you listening this district courts I'm trying to make you didn't have a jubilee for it's not that way it's from the brother buys a brother or a Hebrew buys a Hebrew it's not because they were in bondage to Egypt now wouldn't it be something if you walked up to fight Rome says we ain't working on the seventh day he said I guess you're right you're not gonna work on the seventh day because you ain't gonna be alive now you understand what I'm saying wouldn't that be plainly what he'd say because you ain't gonna be alive somebody's gonna be out there making bridge they didn't make brick six days and take a day off they have done that to start with because when they first started with the children of Israel and Egypt they were not in bondage there were free people Pharaoh had made them free with when Pharaoh passed on then they started the bondage situation Israel wasn't down there 400 years in bondage there were there a couple of hundred years as victorious people living in a wonderful land and being wealth out of right did you see you can't just put everything and say well that West no you've got to find it with the Prophet and let him tell you what it is see because he tells us in the Bible all right now if he's telling us correctly then there's a jubilee though it would fall over seven years and when you would do you would let go free like I said we want to make it this way I wish you'd listen to that message over again of life Sunday I mean I'm honest I wish you would because I put so much in depth into it of the statements that you really let's listen to it ain't bragging on my own himself I'm just telling the truth I wish you'd listen to it and just sit down and listen sensitively to the things that I was trying to cover of the the different points that it's Redemption like I said I go to brother Colley he's my brother I said brother I owe you money but I can't pay you so I'll go into bondage to you to work for you to pay that back well he's my brother he understands upfront what's going on and he knows that I'm gonna work six years but in the seventh I'm going free because that's I want you to get that in a minute we're brother and said this is the law of God these things that I'm talking about is the law not just outs of mankind God set down the law we'll see when they come around remember how he's expressing it when it come around to my six years and I go to brother Colley nusrah probably call him I've worked hard in the hope of being able to happen to do and work for you I've tried now the seventh is the rest and I'm going home and he says okay then we read the Bible to show it he said okay what you have need of I'll give it to you back in the Old Testament I'll give you enough to take care of you they didn't just throw him out here Cohen says yeah but I don't think you paid me enough no listen this one over here he's only paid $2,000 back on his bill and you owe me 10 it ain't nothing we will do with it he goes free at the end of that time all right and it goes down to where each one of those represents that freedom that release but he has to give you we read the Bible he has to give you enough to live off of until you get started my lord our government is better off and we are they ended the war what they do I know what never did go completely through but and no but it worked for some of it but you know what they don't at the end of the war here America they made a decree that they give the man so much money and AM you ever studied your history I gave them especially the mule and so many hundred dollars that ever personal folks get now we know they didn't get it cause it didn't work but I still I'm trying to what I'm trying to say is the government greater than we are does they handle food stamps and at least give them to people to where they can go in and get them some food but yet we just hoard everything to ourselves and no we read it to you there the Bible said that they may not know poor among you and said remember you were a bondsman you were in bondage in Egypt so you remember that see those things all mean something they mean a it's talking about a release a time to let go and everything and I read you where the Prophet said they went out totally and the Bible said - they went out didn't or dime didn't have to pay nothing it doesn't matter what you owed you went out free when the Jubilee was sounded but then we also read that there were certain things under the seventh that if you go into bondage with a wife when we read it right out of the scripture when you release comes you wife those wait but if for your master you went in didn't have a wife your master gives you a while and you have children the Bible plainly tells you the wife and the children don't go free did you I mean you're at least folks read it off the screen whether you can tell me I don't know where I believe that or not well maybe you're not red enough Bible but it was right there on the screen that's one thing I do is I put up there for you to read it now you're gonna argue with God about what said but what about all of those things is examples because the 7/7 is 49 there's no aid involved there's no fifty involved it's the Jubilee it's a release all right then you come to the fiftieth sure then everything goes free Leviticus 25:10 everything goes free with the Prophet when he went to it he went into the Jubilees and the thing and he brought it right down to Leviticus 25 8 was he seven sevens or 49 and the 49s didn't remember we gave it to you the forty-nine offer them of the Feast of the trumpets the forty-nine represents the church ages you had seven Church ages you know if you think God ain't so perfect on what he does and I was riding through Israel and brother George Smith knew you know he knew it would throw me for a loop so he warned me a little ahead of time he said brother Dale George he said how many church ages are they you know I knew doing something so I went alone I said there's seven Church ages he said well how many candlesticks are they I said well there's seven golden candlesticks he said we're fixing to pice the House and Senate of Israel I'm driving down the bus he said would you mind counting over that House and Senate and tell me how many candlesticks they are and I looked out that window and I went one two three four five six seven eight nine I said brother George we got a problem what is it we got too many candlesticks see what would they use seven golden candlesticks and one of Israel used their menorah of why do you pronounce that word which is meaning for the candlestick they use it and get on all the things that others they have the sevens that out this they have all kind of thing so I'm curious we got stopped you know everywhere was going when I took off the Reuben which was the God and he was smart guy I'd love to bring him here sometimes and let him just speak for about a week to us about Israel in the think he's very smart I said Ruben you got to explain something to me he said what is it Sam I said you got too many candlesticks over the House and Senate I said cause in the Bible it's only seven he said you know what he said we don't understand why he said we believe the seven candlesticks represents the creation because they believe in a seven-day career they don't believe six days and rest is just ever they don't even go that way they believe in and this is why they stated seven-day creation seven-day creation anything you say to him he'd say that was the seven-day creation all right I said all right I can follow you and then how come you got nine over your house that's in it some of you heard this right you know what I'm saying he said well we do believe that one of those others out of the you know four seven and then we leave one of those represents God he said that's the best I can tell you I said well what's the other one he said don't know I you know I just simply asked him a question I said well if if that one that represents God could it be that the other one to make it out to nine would represent the person who's worshipping God hmm could be you know what you see even he had no answer why they had that nine candlestick sitting over the House and Senate that's bigger than you might gone on signs I leaned in great big old thing up over the top is big is this building crossways and great at way up there it was the menorah I see you talk to me ain't nothing but seven golden counter station what's brother Dale trying to do do you want to ride over and look at it if you don't take your phone right now turn it on top in menorah then you're gonna find they tell have a nine candlestick I don't know what that means I just go by the 7 because we know where the 7 church ages in sign letter Brennan said there was 7 Church ages in Old Testament right he said there's 7 search agent in New Testament now you can pick up one or two of those in the Old Testament and and like it was a shouting down by the walls and by the river when they crossed and you call it Pentecostal you can call this out of the other but I've never found one round explained the seven churches in the Old Testament as to explain his age but I believe it was a seven church ages in New Testament all right but in those sevens you remember listen if you don't get nothing out of the message listen to one point if you're still using a number and you go up to a number seven and you stop coach number seven is complete right and when you come up to seven you're not eternal that's why the Millennium is the seventh day and brother Branham said it would come in to show the sin curse because God works six days rested the seventh we fell in the rest and said we'll come back to a millennial reign for the world and all the things because that millennial reign will be the seventh day he said out of Eden that's what it represents but remember it's the seven and laying it's for the season see it's not an eight David sitting on the throne is under a seven we got a lot of Bible to go but think about it now what Rena says on the message Jubilee but then ever seven years it was the law of God that there was a Jubilee year and when the Jubilee year come by then the priest rode through the land sounding the trumpet telling you you could go free alright now seven sevens is the seven represents your seven seven forty-nine represents your seven Church ages we gave you that out of feast of the trumpet okay now that rest time each church age had arrest these church eggs how did you believe because these church age had a message these church age had a messenger that rode the land to declare Liberty to the people right so you seven salvage the seven day rest your release represented the church ages and in the east church' hu had to release these Church age had the baptism of the Holy Ghost all right but there was no release there there was no rapture there was no change in the body it was eternal life in the soul right of what a wonderful thing that have always tried to get you to see and though you get tired maybes means an example in things but that's the best I can do you realize this 7th church age was a special one a special age and that without us could not be made perfect all the other ages is dead and in the grave this is the only age if the people are alive in this seventh age is most marvellous thing those seven sevens is 49 a messenger to each church age okay a release to Easter eggs are you listening a release to each church age is a type of example of the 7-year release the rest they had all right but nobody made it to the 50 they made it to the 50 in the soul in the new birth but they never made it to a 50 to come to a change of the body or a rapture or anything like that and you just think I know we have discussions we've had it about this and that the other about it because it's hard to calculate those things and to keep it in the right order when you try to talk about 250 a lot of people says you don't have a 50 that you just make the circle back to the first and go back again you're right but you're not all right because it's got to come one day to a 50 it can't keep on going back to a 1 you go back to a 1 it just puts you back in you're still in time it's long you're making that circle 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1 2 3 go for you're in time the future home is not future home is an 8 or a 50 it's right to think about that there is no eighth day that's true but then you got to go to the profit in the future home and he found an eighth day it doesn't change in your thoughts if you get it correctly the one two three four five six seven one two three is a type of eternal life well one day they will be one day they will be a 50th Jubilee for the world and mankind and that's the future home you got to come under a night to get to that place alright not worried about trying to get this one two three four five six not worried about trying to get that into place it's the point of getting what you're talking about see I asked the question years ago and preached on it many times many church age is already seven right and winning church age messengers are they but some of you've been around here long enough to order know what I'm talking about you got to have eight to come into view they have not you gonna wind up in the wrong one yeah but brother branham we look at the picture and we see brother Branham in the seventh search aid was he here or here which one was he was he at the beginning of lady ousia or did he come into being at the ending of Lady of SIA every search agent masik your advert search agent imagine hear you properly said comes to the end of the age everyone has to now listen this what happened in this age it's what I said this ages are most marvelous of all because in this age the Holy Ghost came himself that's not my words that's the words of your prophet no messenger and way off my nose no messenger to the age that's why it took a prophetic prophet to come the messenger to the age because the Holy Ghost came himself in his fullness of the baptism but in the end of the age and it always ends upon the others we find our than the messenger sent and all of these scruples and things are to be placed did brother Branham come as to be the messenger of Lady osya or did he come to be the messenger to the bride in the end time to take her from time to eternity now which way well you're making two men messengers oh so you're not gonna listen to what the Prophet says because you got your mind made up but still what are you gonna do with it well brother Branham says in the church in the seal book I didn't give this to him progress 72 talking about the Pentecostal age with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the cabbage down on that and there cannot be no more ages that's all of it that's the Philadelphia are not the lady of C&H but then we found in study of the scripture that's a messenger to the age come right at the end of the age every time Paul come at the end of the age we find out Iranians come at the end of the age Martin into the age Luther into the Catholic age and what Wesley at the end of the Lutheran age and Pentecost at the end of the age of sanctification through the baptism of the Holy Ghost and at the end of the Pentecostal age we're supposed to receive according to the Word of God help us to not to show either that we were to receive a messenger that will take all these loose ends out there and reveal a whole secret for the rap string of the church now that's what I say we think we know what we're talking about because we've got sevens we got this did Paul come at the end of the age I've asked you that before wait start on it many times where did Paul come right here right here where did Iranians come where did these come we're doing Elijah come you got eight messengers or our manifest let me use the word because it only use it as an angel in you got eight manifestations of God during the church ages because this age is very special you got to in this age you got the Holy Ghost coming himself and he came on a Susur Street but then brother Branham come along in the 30s and 40s and brought the message do you say whatever you just you just make things so complicated you got the pulpit you say well why don't say only what the prophets saying all right we found in the study of the scripture that the messenger to the aides come right at the end of the age every time so Paul according to what you're reading without understanding Paul come at the end of the age how could his message been to Ephesus simple question Irina's his message did he come at the end of the age then he was - that would have been the messenger - pergolas but you see here's where the prophet puts it in order now watch him Paul come at the end of the age so bring Paul right here then he can bring the message to Ephesus and they cabbage down on it I rainiest falls right here come forth brings the message to some lerna Martin each one goes let's read it we find out that Iranians come at the end of the age Martin into the age Luther the end of the Catholic age now where's the catholic age onto here so did luther come here or did he come here wesley at the end of the lutheran age now we've got it laid out in order Wesley come at the end of Luther's they had to put Wesley way down here if you're just courtly minded and Pentecost at the end of the age of sanctification your sanctification yours Wesley at the end of the Pentecostal age see brother Branham is not the messenger to the lady of seein Church age the Holy Ghost himself is the messenger you don't put a man in there you put the Holy Ghost and done it as Wesley to dine down with sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost came on is this the street of course there's still a lot of people don't believe that the Zeus's people had the baptism of the Holy Ghost well I've argued that all the way down that's telling don't worry about it but that's the reason they took a prophetic prophet to come down no messenger to the aged there was no messenger to be placed our a man it was the Holy Ghost that come on the Zeus's tree then brother Branham came into N to bring the message to take all the scruples is that the words of the Prophet we read while ago but you see that's where you don't want to listen to that point because you know that it's tearing things apart not trying to tear down the message turning apart are our personal ideas and tolerance and see you still the hook just as well as say in the seventh day like I told you but that meant work at time you some of you heard it something that but I was just standing uptown and because I speaking on the rest and how that the Sabbath the old Sabbath was the sixth day I mean seventh day and Jesus raised the first day of the week and this man right out in front car we was in I read lunch right he said what are you trying to say I said I'm trying to simply just take a calendar and the Bible and show you that Israel worshiped under the Sabbath rest the seventh day we worship in honor of the resurrection some of you heard what happened after then that man took out his pocketknife and he said there twiddling his fingers and he was so mad that didn't stop me because I done made the statement I didn't call him out and rebuke him I just denied him even sitting there but he had his knife out he was shaking you so mad at me for what see you're seventh-day adventists is right with an Old Testament rest do you understand the way I said that with an Old Testament rest you're seventh-day adventists is correct but we don't worship on the seventh day we worship on the first day as an honor of the Resurrection not as a commandment we don't have a commandment to keep any day we've got to keep every day every day is the same with the Christian but then when your prophet picked it up he brought a release 7 7 is 49 now think about I know I didn't take enough talking back there on that but think about it 7 7 is 49 representative Church aid and brother Branham come to bring the message at the end of lady osya he stepped on the scene to bring a message he stepped on the scene in the 30s and 40s right in there he had to do what he said on the church age book 327 church eggs will this messenger Malachi for Luke 17 32 do two things one turn are the children back faith and thought to revealed the seven thunders which is revelation obtained in the seven seals it'll be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn the hearts of the children back that's exactly the quote he's so brother Branham had to do a work of restoration under the baptism of the Holy Ghost which was son of God and remember you come three sons nine he said he's the son he's son of God during the seven churches he said when I come on I've got him laying here in front of me if he owner Ito the unveiling of God he said just for a moment right in between you turned back to the Son of Man see when brother Branham come on the earth he had to he came up under that Holy Ghost he was speaking of the son of man then that when he reached his message what his match it was all way back he was to do two things he was to turn us back to the word then he was to bring the seals so his message beginning the seals the other was restoration that's what I'm telling you this age has two things this age had it perfect to line up with Leviticus and to line up with the others because you come 7 7 is 49 brother Branham was that messenger that rode through the land that we rid of the high priest or the priest was to ride through the land and declare Liberty to come for the next year and as he rode through the land it was his message right it was his message that declared the Liberty whose message was it in the days of Paul it was Paul's message that set 2 people free these churches had a messenger but this age had a compound meaning of the Holy Ghost coming himself in his fullness in the baptism and then after he comes the messenger comes to bring the message for this day do you understand what it would mean you work 6 years and the priest would ride through the land and tell you next year is a release in those church ages you had a messenger to each age to declare the baptism in the Holy Ghost the release the Word of God for the aged and what was needed when you come to Azusa Street you had no man standing there you had the Holy Ghost to come himself in his fullness the Prophet said no messenger he said to the aged because the Holy Ghost came inside then at the end of the age the Prophet comes on the scene because remember what this prophets going to do no messenger in any age done what this prophet had to do did you follow me I said no messenger in any age done what this prophet had to do because the messenger in the age would just declare a Liberty for the six-year this man had to declare Liberty for the six going into the seventh as a rest but then in that he declared oh the that's why toes he I said this in 74 I said we could prize to hear your 2026 nobody wants to know where that come from they come from the from this putting together this dates and times and seasons of the Prophet 2026 would be 49 which would be a jubilee there were 49 we didn't wanted a cover a 50 if you could think about it enough to get to a 50 this prophet when I sat down listening to him as I said he was talking about the God I had seen myself he was talking about the god of the word he was bringing the word throughout I could understand he was bringing me to an understanding of a Jubilee that word Jubilee give me just a minute that word Jubilee means a release there was release over seven years but then there was to be a 50 like white said they never physically ever celebrated the physical 50 because he's going out to let everything go free and it wouldn't go do it nobody ever celebrated the physical 50 with you and I gonna have to take a change this prophets message was to come to show us eternal life he was to the car to declare liberty that had never been declared before he was to declare a 50 49 s only spoke of the church ages in this church age and that prophet entered the land with his message back there if you wanted this put it in a time bracket somewhere in 62 he started his own message I'll give you the quotes on all of that rapture message all of them not in the years of preparation not in the years of the healing campaign I'll give you the prophets quotes on all these thing but when he said he when they begin to say little Brennan spoke of eternal life here that's what caught me we spoke of eternal life dire and you say no no come on ain't gonna argue with you and just tell it you believe it or not we stood and looked at it one day we're coming to eternal life we think we're safe we hope we say I believe I'm saying you can't tell me I am saved now how many of you went through that and how many of you heard people say that but I Wrentham never come to to try to destroy anything you had become to tell you what you had was right but you needed to step up a step you needed to enter into a 50 so he went to the future home and I can't help it if it was told out I'm just telling it as it was toe that brother branham asked billy powell said did you understand what I taught on that future home he said yeah daddy he said Billy did you understand he said no he said I can count on my hands the ones that did of course everybody knows all about it never had heard about it go to organized religion never had that one they had to age they had a ride look Church listen this one is so hard to try to breathe he realized God when it comes what did he say he says you work six years did you rest the settlement he said what are we gonna do he said God's gonna give you a double portion right you agree with that now God was gonna give a double portion to cover this to seventh know proportion now what are you gonna do about from their own you don't plant in the seventh you don't reap in the seventh what are you gonna eat Nate go remember in the eighth you've got a plant before you can reap right are we talking about farming is that plain language you got a double portion on the sixth that would last youth through the seventh and give you something to plant it's in the eighth when you do you planting that's where they never understood brother branham on the future home he was talking about a plant Nate he wouldn't talking about a reaping remember what he says in that future he says all them tops chatters has gone away now you've come to reality read the future home you've come to reality of an eight come on you've got seven eight you got to go to the ninth here to reap a harvest because that's exactly what the children of Israel done when they entered the promised land they ate of the old corn of the land right they ate of the old corn they said what are we gonna do Moses says we're gonna eat what they got yeah but we're gonna be out next year he said no not because we're gonna plant they plant it in the eighth and reap their harvest in the ninth year you say you don't go to much luck I'm not going to much afar because that number eight once you get that number eight you'll have to worry about it that's what I was trying to say well ago so I stood back there in 1974 and said this can pass the Year 2026 and never missed the prophets message nor the Bible because 19 in 77 you would have entered a 50th Jubilee for the bride only not for the world or anybody else for the bride 1977 would be the 50th Jubilee the only one that ever come into being and we've turned it down we've had 50 years right 40 42 42 from 77 or something he's got about 42 years or something I ain't no mathematician but that's fur clothes you got 40 years we're heading towards a 50 what if that's that time in between to elapse what if God's letting time run out in us to dwell on a fifty because the church here's what I've been saying now if you want to listen how long have I been teaching of a present tense I am in 1974 that's what I was preaching a fifty is that I am present tense God 1977 this message came alive to me what did it do to you well I'm just still reading samo book I feel saying it came alive to me there because I saw what he's talking about seven sevens is 49 brother branham come into 49th which was a seventh Church age now listen and then that seventh church age the Holy Ghost had preceded him to bring the word but when he came it took a while to him to preach restoration back to the faith of the fathers but in 62 when he stood there on the statue of perfect man he said he's preached it he said 30-something years I've waited our priest on this he struck his message in 63 of eternal life how many times have you heard me make this statement go home pick up the book that lists your tapes go home pick up the book that lists your tapes and read and start in 63 from the seals own and read me one take one of those message where he had anything natural they were all supernatural what about a prophet had preached so much on one God until the world had turned against him he needed to Clark Jesus Christ to be that Almighty God and preached it around the world seven times and they turned him down all at once he says I'm gonna preach on Christ the mystery of God revealed now listen to him as he gets in the book he said I'm gonna preach on Christ the mystery of God revealed and he said if you don't get them sealed what do you say he said if you don't get them sealed go back to seal book and all that wouldn't what he said because he knew we didn't understand it that way he said if you don't get them seals come back to this message tonight what Christ the mystery of God revealed read the book and see see if he said it don't you see he knew what he was doing 1957 he preached syriza's about Melchizedek showing that he was God Almighty Elohim self-existing etcetera etc all of the titles he put him in a lamb in order after the opening of the seals he preached who is this melchester day he didn't preach in the series in the 57 he preached who Melchizedek was now he's saying who is milchester day read the titles to the messages and see that ever one of them is eternal life things that are to be marriage in divorce thinking lens filter masterpiece sees not our with a joke what about it can we see the age in the hour that we're living where the Prophet come on the age and brought the message of eternal life if not now listen if you don't believe this message that we already have in print is the message of eternal life you better be looking for your another messenger and another message because you're going to keep on dying if this ain't the message are you with me if this ain't the message of eternal life you gonna have to house somebody else to come to bring that message well you know where I've always stood I don't care who says one who does what what this message is the message of eternal life we don't need another messenger we don't need another we need for people to sit down and read just read what he says study what he said he said your resurrection was on the inside of you well then what do we need a resurrection from somewheres out why do we need somebody to call the dead if your resurrection is inside of you come on see that's where when I start clicking it down I feel that old thing coming back now he's doing away with brother around him he's not looking for this young you've got your own self to fool with on and go to food we cuz I've taught it from day one and I still teach it now this message is the message you eternal life but it's got to be broke down to the people to where they can see what it is we went through the Jew believes we're Pais mankind and all of the tops and shadows right we're in eternity not physically but it's the closest thing there is to eternal life is the Word of God revealed to you and me what about it you believe what about it let me say it this way contains the word Jubilee there in Leviticus I'll be glad to let you have it I don't take about two seconds I'll let you read it the word Jubilee there is the word shout what about when Joshua was walking around Jericho remember toward at seven days and the seven 1306 to a seventh he went seven times and then he says now when I shout you shout it was not the word of Joshua that brought the walls down this and it was the word of the people that Joshua had already spoken to them and told them what to do this message has the message of eternal life it's the shout you want them I'll be glad to let you read them right out of your your numbers for the word the word Jubilee there is the same as the word shout to Joshua that word is the same word shout that appears over in first Thessalonians were said the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a message is that the way brethren read it a shout write the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout what the prophets say he said the shout is the message he said a message to get the people ready works out well we think shout it God draws millions of gallons of water out of the ocean every day and never makes one sound you better believe one thing for certain when you see what I'm talking about you start shouting you'll be more interesting but you know what and I say this in love and all respect from 74 to this day I had one preacher to ask me to come to his church and speak on well I thought it could Pais 77 well brother so-and-so he didn't ever know brother so-and-so ain't never asked me that's what I told you there's been one preacher it even said anything about coming because people don't want to know it's right in the Word of God the shout the voice of the Archangel the trumpet of God remember the other one - at the life's Trump for the trumpet shall sound let me say it this way at the last angels message the shouts going to be in the people that brings death down destroys the walls of Jericho let stand father we're getting where we're taking too much time when I'm sorry but we got too much to try to cover you just forgive us and helpless tears will go either natural meal you bring us back together this afternoon that we may walk on further in you Lord because there's plenty more to preach on we just thank you have your way with us and guide us forgive our sins lead us in Jesus name you dismissed take the name of Jesus we if you chop [Music]
