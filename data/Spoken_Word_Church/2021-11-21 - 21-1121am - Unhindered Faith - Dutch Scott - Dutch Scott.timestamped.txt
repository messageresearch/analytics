[0:24] it's good to be in church this morning
[0:25] amen
[0:27] amen good to see you all certainly good
[0:29] to see you all
[0:30] i'm just thinking how good it was to be
[0:32] in church or how good it is to be in
[0:33] church here this morning i thought
[0:35] but you know what's better than
[0:37] what's better really than being in
[0:39] church or at least it goes right there
[0:41] with it
[0:42] anyways and that's having the desire to
[0:45] be in church
[0:46] you know to actually have a desire to be
[0:49] in church to be with the saints to
[0:50] gather together that's right it just
[0:52] seemed like the further that we go that
[0:54] you know the fewer that have that real
[0:56] true
[1:02] all right one two three we're here right
[1:03] there we go okay
[1:05] hey man i'm just thinking yo but again
[1:07] it just seems like there's very few that
[1:08] have that real
[1:10] deep-seated desire to to be there every
[1:12] time those tor church doors are open
[1:16] and yeah i know the flesh is weak

[2:48] david gadman uh who said to tell you
[2:51] hello also brother dale from brother
[2:53] homer is there and he's holding down the
[2:54] fort for us there while we're here
[2:57] and uh so we just really appreciate him
[2:59] for that too you know when brother wade
[3:01] called me
[3:03] brother wade called that's if i could
[3:04] come stand in for him while he was
[3:06] gone this weekend i told sister april i
[3:09] told my wife there i said you know i
[3:11] i can't turn him down i can't i can't
[3:13] say no as many times as he has come
[3:15] every time
[3:17] i've called and asked and you know we've
[3:18] just got just a small group there and
[3:20] i'm i'm the only minister and something
[3:22] comes up i'd call brother dale he's
[3:24] about my first go-to brother brother
[3:26] wade can you come down and
[3:28] almost without fail he has always just
[3:31] run right down and rescheduled things
[3:33] and done done things for me so of course
[3:34] i just had to say yes and
[3:37] amen so so we're solely
[3:39] you know and also i told brother brother
[3:41] sam this also but i said brother brother
[3:43] wade he's so special that he was
[3:45] actually the first minister that i i
[3:47] forgot to give an offering to one time
[3:50] and he he was so gracious that he
[3:52] actually came back after that and not to
[3:54] pick up the offer and i mailed that to
[3:55] him but he actually came back to to
[3:58] preach for me afterwards and i
[3:59] remembered i did remember to give him
[4:01] the
[4:02] to give him his offering there but that
[4:04] was quite embarrassing
[4:06] that was quite embarrassing anyways
[4:08] oh my i tell you what why are you
[4:10] standing won't you do this with me won't
[4:12] you turn with me to saint mark chapter 9
[4:16] and then we're going to go back to
[4:18] daniel
[4:19] daniel chapter 10
[4:22] and i was praying and wondering on what
[4:23] i should be
[4:25] speaking this morning what direction to
[4:27] take and
[4:28] trying to find the
[4:30] the leadership of the lord my you're
[4:32] fixing to find out real fast that i'm
[4:34] i'm not brother brother sam or brother
[4:36] wade and
[4:38] amen i'm i'm not what these other
[4:40] ministers here at all but by the grace
[4:42] of god i am what i am amen and um
[4:45] but i was praying and wondering what i
[4:46] should speak on
[4:48] what direction to take here what the
[4:49] will of the lord would be for you know
[4:50] the service here
[4:52] and
[4:53] i thought well what about what i
[4:54] preached last weekend you know i had
[4:56] such a wonderful time the preachers have
[4:58] a good time preaching too we want you
[5:00] guys to have a good time but we have a
[5:01] good time
[5:02] and i've always been of the mindset that
[5:04] if i can have a good time usually the
[5:06] people have a good time but if i have a
[5:07] terrible time man it's rough on you guys
[5:09] you know it's rough that way
[5:12] but uh but i preached on my theophany
[5:14] and again man oh man what a what a good
[5:16] time i had there the presence of the
[5:18] lord came down
[5:19] just channel after channel was open i
[5:21] was seeing scriptures connected i've
[5:22] never seen connect like that before and
[5:24] i just thought wow man that's that's
[5:26] awesome
[5:27] and then i thought um no
[5:30] there ain't no way i'm going to get up
[5:32] here and try to preach on my theophanies
[5:33] in front of brother dale there is no way
[5:36] that i'm going to do that in front of
[5:37] this brother here this brother is a
[5:39] legend when it comes to teaching and
[5:40] preaching the deep things in the message
[5:42] here so
[5:43] anyways i said no we ain't gonna do that
[5:46] went back to prayer and i think i found
[5:48] the leadership for the for the services
[5:50] today so we're just going to take a
[5:51] simple thought on faith this morning and
[5:55] just pray and i believe it is it'll be
[5:56] pleasing to the lord before we read our
[5:58] scriptures though here amen why don't we
[6:00] just bow our heads and ask the lord to
[6:02] bless his word one more time
[6:07] dear jesus we thank you lord
[6:09] we thank you dear god that we can be
[6:11] gathered together here lord with
[6:12] brothers and sisters
[6:15] brothers and sisters in christ those who
[6:17] have like precious faith dear god
[6:22] we're thankful lord that we can
[6:24] come together under the banner of a of a
[6:27] message in this last day
[6:30] a message dear god that has told us who
[6:32] we are and
[6:34] lord not just who you are lord but who
[6:36] we are
[6:39] and to know lord jesus that we're a part
[6:41] of you
[6:42] amen
[6:43] to know dear god what our heritage is
[6:45] lord and the inheritance that you've
[6:47] given us
[6:50] dear god we thank you from the bottoms
[6:52] of our heart lord we thank you
[6:54] we just asked lord as we stand here
[6:56] before this open word dear god that you
[6:59] would come and you would
[7:00] break it open supernaturally to our
[7:03] souls to our hearts lord may you just
[7:04] encourage us here this morning dear god
[7:06] i just feel like it's such a simple
[7:08] thought perhaps lord but
[7:10] the lord jesus one that could encourage
[7:12] us and help us along the way and if we
[7:14] could just have one lord that was helped
[7:16] along the way today there then then dear
[7:18] god it would it would be worth it it'd
[7:20] be worth everything we've done and
[7:22] every effort that we've put forth lord
[7:25] god we love you and we love your saints
[7:27] just ask now your blessings upon these
[7:29] words i'm about to read i pray in jesus
[7:32] name amen
[7:34] amen
[7:36] so mark chapter 9 verse 23 here
[7:40] amen
[7:43] and jesus said unto him if thou canst
[7:45] believe
[7:46] all things are possible
[7:49] to him that believeth amen all things
[7:51] are possible
[7:52] turn back with me to daniel chapter 10
[7:54] as well
[7:56] amen one verse from here too
[7:59] i don't want to keep you standing too
[8:00] long here but daniel chapter 10 verse 1
[8:03] in the third year of cyrus king of
[8:04] persia
[8:05] a thing
[8:07] i like that a thing
[8:09] was revealed unto daniel whose name was
[8:11] called belt chazar
[8:13] and the thing
[8:15] was true
[8:17] but the time appointed was long and he
[8:19] understood the thing
[8:21] and had understanding of the vision amen
[8:24] god bless you may be seated here this
[8:25] morning
[8:26] amen you know just like i said i want to
[8:28] speak on faith just a little bit if i
[8:30] could here this morning
[8:32] and uh
[8:33] you know i believe that
[8:35] that should be really
[8:37] just about the most basic cry of a true
[8:40] believer of a christian
[8:42] the longer we go and the further we go
[8:44] into you know these last days i think
[8:46] that really should be just a basic
[8:50] basic cry of the believer here should be
[8:52] just lord give me more faith i need more
[8:54] faith right
[8:55] i need more faith and
[8:58] not not faith as
[9:00] as the nominal churches of today would
[9:02] would define faith and you know people
[9:04] in the world how they would look at
[9:06] faith they talk about the faith for this
[9:07] or the faith for that but when you
[9:09] really get down to it and you begin
[9:10] talking to folks you see that most
[9:12] people have an idea when they talk about
[9:14] faith it's more of a hocus pocus
[9:17] or a rub the bottle and the genie comes
[9:19] out you know and
[9:21] maybe you'll click your ruby slippers
[9:23] together three times and wish upon a
[9:25] star and
[9:26] maybe somehow some way that god will
[9:28] deem to come down and actually grant
[9:30] your prayer you know and uh
[9:33] but true faith is not like that
[9:37] i'm so thankful we have a message that
[9:39] that explains and reveals what faith is
[9:42] and true faith is a
[9:44] it's a revelation which has been
[9:45] revealed to you something that has been
[9:47] revealed to you by by god himself
[9:49] something that's been revealed way down
[9:51] in your heart and you can't let it go
[9:53] amen we look back at the
[9:55] characters and the the
[9:57] the heroes from the the scriptures and
[9:59] what we find is that these men and these
[10:01] women they were they were moved by
[10:03] something you know there was something
[10:05] that would get a hold of them there was
[10:06] a thing as daniel said a thing was
[10:08] revealed to them and they couldn't get a
[10:10] real away from the thing so what you
[10:12] found out was it was not so much that
[10:14] they were holding the faith but the
[10:16] faith was holding them right and there's
[10:19] a big difference between those two
[10:20] things because i'm weak as i said this
[10:22] flesh is weak but if god's holding on to
[10:25] me this morning
[10:26] it's okay
[10:28] it's okay right well god bless you
[10:30] brother louis amen brother dale said you
[10:32] were gone amen it's good to see you this
[10:33] morning
[10:34] amen but
[10:36] so faith is a it's a very real thing
[10:39] brother branham made this this ever so
[10:42] familiar statement in the church age
[10:43] book one time and
[10:45] what he said there was that we ought to
[10:46] pray for the paraphrasing here forgive
[10:48] me but we ought to pray for revelation
[10:52] more than anything else
[10:54] more than anything else we ought to be
[10:56] praying for revelation
[10:58] he said well i need healing in my body
[11:00] amen i'm praying for healing no you need
[11:02] to be praying for the revelation that he
[11:04] is your healer right
[11:06] you say well i'm i'm lost i've got sin
[11:09] in my life i've got this i need to pray
[11:11] for a saving for a savior whatever you
[11:13] need to pray for the revelation that
[11:15] jesus christ died for your sins amen
[11:18] shed his blood for you right
[11:19] you need to pray for a revelation
[11:22] everything comes by revelation
[11:24] everything comes by faith
[11:26] it's all faith faith is a revelation and
[11:29] revelation is faith so
[11:31] yes we
[11:32] we pray for more faith lord give me more
[11:35] faith
[11:38] so with that said we're i want to talk
[11:40] this morning really i guess if i could
[11:42] title this i
[11:44] i'm tired faith has no
[11:46] hindrances
[11:48] faith has no hindrances here amen i'm
[11:51] going to take that from a quote a very
[11:52] familiar quote here
[11:54] and
[11:55] brother branham said this in the message
[11:57] 1963 perseverance it's okay to read
[12:00] quotes hearing it amen so all right we
[12:02] good
[12:03] perseverance
[12:05] he said now she had
[12:07] many hindrances
[12:08] this little woman now she had a daughter
[12:11] that was having epilepsy and
[12:13] and she was very very bad and and she'd
[12:15] heard that jesus healed epilepsy
[12:18] now faith cometh by hearing
[12:20] are you hearing something saying are you
[12:22] hearing a thing this morning right faith
[12:25] cometh by hearing
[12:26] he said now
[12:28] she she'd heard that jesus healed
[12:29] epilepsy faith cometh by hearing and and
[12:32] that was her child
[12:34] so she was determined to get down
[12:36] somewhere and hear jesus and now she had
[12:39] many hindrances just many many
[12:42] hindrances
[12:43] but her faith didn't have no hindrance
[12:47] tonight people has lots of hindrances
[12:50] right he said your mind has lots of
[12:52] hindrances
[12:53] but your faith there's nothing can stand
[12:56] in its way
[12:58] because faith has or faith knows no
[13:01] hindrances
[13:03] praise the lord amen now now this little
[13:05] woman here i can relate to her very well
[13:07] i can relate to her because i can look
[13:09] in my life i can see my flesh and the
[13:11] things that i go through and i can see
[13:13] many many things that stand in the way
[13:17] sure you can too right we're human we
[13:19] all have the same human experience and
[13:21] she had he said here he said she has
[13:23] many many many many hindrances she had
[13:26] here but not her faith her faith was
[13:28] unhindered
[13:31] man that's awesome
[13:33] that's awesome right there to know i can
[13:35] be hindered in many different ways in
[13:37] this thing right here but when that
[13:38] revelation strikes my heart it has no
[13:41] hindrances whatsoever
[13:43] praise the lord
[13:44] praise the lord did you hear it
[13:48] faith cometh by hearing right
[13:50] right so this little woman she she heard
[13:53] it and she she heard the truth and
[13:54] that's what he said here she she had
[13:56] heard that jesus healed epilepsy
[13:59] man what an awesome thing to hear
[14:02] years ago i
[14:04] i knew a brother that his wife was sick
[14:07] she had a very serious disease she she
[14:09] actually she passed away from it
[14:11] later on but
[14:13] she
[14:13] god called her home and put it that way
[14:15] she was she's a christian so god took
[14:17] her home that was just a vehicle that he
[14:19] used to to do it with see but but still
[14:21] she so he he came and one day we were
[14:23] talking he said man he said if i could
[14:25] just he was searching the message and he
[14:26] was trying to you find people reaching
[14:28] out to people all over the world trying
[14:30] to find an example of maybe where where
[14:32] they had been healed from this certain
[14:34] disease this this certain disease it was
[14:36] a terrible disease and he was trying to
[14:38] find somebody
[14:40] that he could look at and say god was
[14:41] able to heal that disease and i know
[14:43] that if he healed that one that one
[14:45] right there then he'll heal my wife too
[14:47] and and i and and for some reason he was
[14:49] trying to anchor in that and i said but
[14:51] but brother you got to understand that
[14:53] if god healed a toothache he can heal
[14:55] that
[14:56] right if god healed a you know a an
[14:58] aching back he can heal that if god can
[15:00] heal a stumped toe he can heal that it's
[15:03] not one thing greater or worse or or
[15:05] whatever it it might seem that way and
[15:07] that in front of him was a hindrance it
[15:09] was a great hindrance because he never
[15:10] could find anybody
[15:13] that god had had reached out and healed
[15:15] from from this disease
[15:18] i'm not saying there was never you know
[15:20] there has never been anybody that god
[15:22] would heal from this certain disease god
[15:23] heals everything
[15:26] and truth be told she got the greatest
[15:28] healing she could ever have when she
[15:29] crossed over that over the way right
[15:31] praise the lord we thank god for that
[15:33] for faith there
[15:35] but he said here again now she she heard
[15:37] she'd heard that that jesus healed
[15:40] hillary uh epilepsy now but now even
[15:43] with the hearing because we all go
[15:44] through these things we've we've heard
[15:46] we've heard the message and we we've
[15:48] heard your messages on faith we've heard
[15:50] the deep mysteries of god we've heard
[15:52] all these things like that but even in
[15:53] that yet in our in our flesh and our
[15:55] bodies we still have a lot of hindrances
[15:58] right
[15:59] we still got a lot of things that we go
[16:00] through
[16:02] and and this little woman did here i'm
[16:04] not going to preach the whole time on
[16:05] her but it's just so good when you look
[16:06] at you know what she come through here
[16:08] but the one the woman that he's talking
[16:09] about here is the woman in and she's in
[16:12] in saint matthew chapter 15 here and and
[16:15] and and she had her daughter had
[16:17] epilepsy or the bible said that she her
[16:19] daughter was sick
[16:21] here let me let me just read it right
[16:22] quick this is matthew chapter 15 and
[16:25] maybe i can get settled down on this but
[16:26] matthew chapter 15 and behold a woman of
[16:28] canaan came out of the
[16:30] same coast and
[16:32] cried unto him saying have mercy on me o
[16:34] lord thou said of david
[16:36] my daughter is grievously fixed with the
[16:39] devil
[16:41] but he answered her not a word
[16:44] and his disciples came and besought him
[16:46] saying send her away for she crieth
[16:49] after us you see she wasn't going to be
[16:50] dissuaded right
[16:54] she just kept on knocking
[16:56] just kept on knocking right she just
[16:58] kept on knocking send her away for she
[17:00] cries after us
[17:03] but he answered and he said i'm i am not
[17:05] sent unto the lost sheep of the house of
[17:07] israel
[17:10] then she came and she worshipped him
[17:12] saying lord help me
[17:14] think about that he ignores her
[17:16] he says i'm not sent but to the lost
[17:18] sheep of israel i'm not even sent to
[17:21] your people she's a canaanite i'm not
[17:23] even sent to your people
[17:25] and then she comes and worships him
[17:28] and she says lord help me she's still
[17:30] got her need
[17:33] she's still got her hindrances
[17:35] and in fact jesus brother branham goes
[17:37] on to say in one place that this was
[17:38] actually one of the hindrances she has
[17:40] at the same place of perseverance this
[17:42] is actually one of the the hindrances
[17:44] she has was that she was being ignored
[17:46] by jesus
[17:48] oh my goodness
[17:50] can you imagine i mean you go to the
[17:51] lord you cry out to the lord he said he
[17:53] always hears me he's there you know he
[17:55] hears my cries he answers my prayers he
[17:57] does all these things but he she
[17:59] actually she actually was ignored by
[18:01] jesus right
[18:03] that'd be a pretty big hindrance
[18:04] wouldn't it
[18:07] and so she goes worships says lord help
[18:10] me
[18:12] but he answers now he speaks directly to
[18:15] her he's not just talking to the
[18:16] disciples but he speaks directly to her
[18:18] and he said it is not me to take the
[18:21] children's bread and to cast it to
[18:24] dogs
[18:26] so now not only is he ignoring her
[18:30] not only is he saying you know you are
[18:32] of the wrong race
[18:34] but now he is calling her a dog
[18:38] man that's rough
[18:40] in the climate we have in this country
[18:42] today man we you'd get killed you said
[18:44] something like that you know
[18:46] but i mean she's she's i mean you look
[18:48] at the hindrances she has the things
[18:50] that she's going through the things it's
[18:51] been and just the the god himself is
[18:54] calling her a dog
[19:00] she said truth lord
[19:04] she didn't get mad
[19:06] she didn't get upset
[19:09] she didn't get her feelings hurt
[19:11] she didn't get offended
[19:13] and she made a choice and i would say
[19:15] that's that's a big part of our lives we
[19:17] have to make a choice you can choose to
[19:18] be offended blessed is he that's not
[19:21] offended in me
[19:22] you can choose to be offended over
[19:24] something and get your nose stuck in the
[19:26] air and everything else and and but you
[19:28] you will not be blessed that way you'll
[19:30] not get what you asked for that way
[19:32] you'll never you'll never come to to
[19:34] whatever it is that you're seeking it in
[19:36] that way it won't work amen but this
[19:37] this woman says
[19:39] truth lord
[19:41] man
[19:42] it's pretty awesome
[19:44] it's pretty awesome
[19:46] truth lord yet the dogs eat the crumbs
[19:49] which fall from their master's table
[19:52] then jesus answered and said unto her o
[19:54] woman great is thy faith
[19:56] be it unto thee even as thou wilt and
[19:59] her daughter was made whole from that
[20:01] very hour praise the lord amen
[20:03] praise the lord that's a faith builder
[20:05] right there right
[20:06] right
[20:07] great is thy faith
[20:09] be it unto thee
[20:10] even as thou wilt
[20:13] and then again you look this is this is
[20:14] a canaanite woman
[20:15] god is dealing with the jews so there
[20:17] it's not even their time he's not
[20:19] dealing with the gentiles at this time
[20:20] here jesus
[20:22] jesus had ignored her jesus had turned
[20:24] and said it's not for you jesus had
[20:26] turned and called her a dog and all
[20:27] these things but yet he still at her
[20:30] faith at the the anchor of her faith he
[20:33] still answered her cry he didn't have to
[20:38] but he did it because she had faith
[20:42] all she had to do was ask and believe
[20:46] and believe that he could and that he
[20:48] would do it
[20:49] and her daughter was more was more
[20:51] important to her than her pride her her
[20:54] need was more to her than than than
[20:57] the pride of what this would say or what
[20:58] that one would say or my national pride
[21:01] or whatever it might be it was more than
[21:03] that she had a need that was great
[21:07] i think that's a problem today is that
[21:09] most people don't realize they have such
[21:10] a great need of a great savior
[21:14] they don't have such a they don't have a
[21:15] sense of a need everybody is you know
[21:18] they don't know how to come down and say
[21:19] my need is greater than my pride my need
[21:22] is greater than my hurt my need is
[21:24] greater than than whatever it is and
[21:26] they'll hold on to these human emotions
[21:28] and those things become a hindrance to
[21:30] them
[21:32] those things become a hindrance to them
[21:34] but if you could ever just let that
[21:36] faith go down below that and get to that
[21:38] spot where you could say truth lord
[21:41] truth lord right
[21:43] god will move
[21:45] right i forget who it was but i heard a
[21:48] brother make a statement a few years ago
[21:50] he's talking about jesus and the the
[21:53] madman of of
[21:55] i can never pronounce the land there
[21:59] gudera
[22:00] or
[22:01] gurgas gerges knees or something like
[22:03] that
[22:06] you should see me trying to pronounce
[22:07] hebrew words it's not funny
[22:12] but he made him the the brother that was
[22:14] i heard and again i can't i'm trying my
[22:16] best to remember who it was and i can't
[22:17] remember who it was but he made the
[22:18] statement there that that jesus jesus
[22:20] even granted the legion of devil's
[22:23] request
[22:26] i mean if there's anybody that jesus
[22:28] would say man i ain't listening to you
[22:30] you would think you'd be a legion of
[22:31] devils right
[22:33] if there's anybody that god would say
[22:35] no
[22:36] nick say i am not going to answer your
[22:38] prayers that is not going to happen you
[22:40] would think it'd be a legion of devils
[22:43] amongst whom brother branham said there
[22:45] was a there was an alcoholic spirit
[22:46] there was lion spirits there were
[22:48] cheating spirits there was all these
[22:49] things so the man showed up one time and
[22:51] he began just one thing after another he
[22:53] told a lie and then he had to grow and
[22:55] do this one and that one and the devils
[22:56] just kept on one by one as he went
[22:58] through that that sorry life kept just
[23:01] one by one piling on
[23:03] and his whole life fell apart and his
[23:05] family fell apart and his friends ran
[23:07] off from him in the attitudes that he
[23:09] had and everything else because he was
[23:10] just piling these devils on himself and
[23:12] he finally found himself in a graveyard
[23:15] cutting and beating himself and
[23:17] screaming and hollering and full of
[23:19] anger and and all these things and it
[23:21] was nothing but a legion of devils on
[23:23] this man
[23:27] that he had allowed to come in
[23:32] but there was something on the inside of
[23:33] this man that was more than that legion
[23:35] of devils
[23:37] there was something in this this down on
[23:38] the inside of this man that cried out
[23:40] and jesus could hear him plum across the
[23:42] sea so there's somebody crying out and
[23:44] he went all the way across the sea to go
[23:45] to this one man
[23:47] because as soon as that was over what'd
[23:49] he do he got back in the boat and he
[23:50] went back to the other side
[23:54] man again that's pretty awesome that
[23:56] might be my favorite word today
[23:58] that's pretty awesome amen and he would
[24:00] go all the way over there for this one
[24:02] man but when the legion of demons when
[24:04] they when he cast these demons out
[24:06] they they they begged and they said
[24:08] don't don't throw us into the abyss
[24:10] don't don't throw us out there into the
[24:12] darkness into the void don't throw us
[24:14] there
[24:15] and you gotta think demons have motives
[24:17] too
[24:18] and jesus they said let the demons say
[24:20] let us go under this heart of swine and
[24:22] jesus says okay go
[24:24] again he actually granted them their
[24:26] wish
[24:28] if he would regret the wishes of a
[24:30] legion of devils how much more would he
[24:33] grant the the desire of a of a son or a
[24:35] daughter of god has been washing the
[24:37] blood of jesus how much more this
[24:39] morning would he say amen
[24:41] so be it
[24:44] by faith
[24:46] by revelation
[24:49] someone had the right motives
[24:52] and those demons promptly turned around
[24:54] and ran that herd of swine right off
[24:56] into the right off into the ocean you
[24:58] know why he ran them off into the ocean
[25:00] while they ran them off in the ocean
[25:02] it's because the spirits
[25:04] didn't doubt the pigs died but the
[25:06] spirit brother brandon made the
[25:07] statement he said god will take his man
[25:09] but he won't take the spirit and he said
[25:11] and the devil would take his take his
[25:13] man but he will leave the spirits behind
[25:15] and they'll go on and get on somebody
[25:17] else and that herd of swine went off and
[25:19] died amen but those spirits were free to
[25:21] go somewhere else
[25:23] lying didn't stop when that when those
[25:24] pigs ran off that how that cliff did it
[25:29] but jesus granted it
[25:32] oh my
[25:33] glory to god
[25:35] i only believe
[25:39] all things are possible
[25:42] just believe the thing
[25:44] the thing
[25:47] have faith catch that revelation amen
[25:49] faith is
[25:51] faith is
[25:52] unhindered right
[25:55] has no hindrances right
[25:58] she had many hindrances but her faith
[26:00] did not have any hindrances
[26:05] you know maybe we could say we see here
[26:07] this morning we can look back perhaps in
[26:08] the you know we look back at just our
[26:11] you know yesterday or the last week we
[26:13] might have had a rough time and
[26:14] went through this maybe a down time or
[26:16] whatever it was could have been the last
[26:17] you know 30 minutes or just right before
[26:19] you pulled up in church i remember
[26:20] brother barry coffey making this
[26:21] statement one year at the men's meeting
[26:23] and he talked about this families i
[26:25] always just admire this family and they
[26:27] would come up and and you know this this
[26:28] wife and husband and their kids and
[26:30] they'd come up in their car and every
[26:31] every sunday before they got out of the
[26:33] car they would all bow their heads and
[26:35] they would just pray so sincerely and
[26:38] then they'd get out and they'd go to
[26:39] church he said one day i went to the
[26:40] brother and i told the brother he said
[26:41] man i just want you to know that you are
[26:43] a testimony you are a witness you are
[26:46] such an encouragement to me when i see
[26:48] you come in and pray for your faith your
[26:49] whole family just praying like that
[26:51] before you go into church and you're
[26:53] praying for the services and the brother
[26:55] looked at him kind of you know a gas he
[26:56] looked at him kind of just incredulous
[26:58] and he said brother he said we're not
[27:00] necessarily praying for the service he
[27:02] said we're repenting he said because
[27:03] we've been fighting and fussing the
[27:05] whole way to church and running late and
[27:07] this and that
[27:09] we're repenting before we go in because
[27:11] we don't want the lightning bolts to
[27:12] reign out of heaven and get us right
[27:16] perhaps we all can relate to that in one
[27:18] way or the other because again we're
[27:20] human we share this same journey amen if
[27:23] there's one in here that can say they're
[27:24] perfect then you need to get up here
[27:26] because it ain't me
[27:30] the curtains at the hotel worked really
[27:32] what best curtains i have ever seen in
[27:33] the hotel you know they always leave
[27:34] that one gap where that light can it
[27:36] always comes in and gets you right
[27:40] that curtain this morning i got up early
[27:41] was studying my wife was sleeping she
[27:43] pulled the pillow over her head and
[27:44] she's sleeping in there and i'm just
[27:46] working away you know pecking away at my
[27:48] computer and and and and putting things
[27:51] in and this and out and just re-changing
[27:53] things in mind and and then i look at my
[27:55] watch and it said eight o'clock and i
[27:56] said what
[27:58] it's dark
[28:00] that was the best curtains i ever saw
[28:02] you know told my wife went woke her up
[28:04] real easy you need to get up honey it's
[28:06] eight o'clock what why didn't you wake
[28:07] me up earlier i said i didn't know it
[28:09] was that late
[28:13] and then it's
[28:14] long
[28:16] praise saints pray right
[28:19] pray saints pray
[28:22] maybe we could say you know i know i
[28:24] know the prophet
[28:25] i know the prophet said that faith has
[28:27] no hindrances but man oh man i surely do
[28:34] i have a lot of hindrances you know
[28:36] people has a lot of entrances
[28:39] my mind has a lot of hindrances
[28:44] whether it be work and busy and this and
[28:46] that and everything else
[28:48] my body has a lot of hindrances
[28:52] our lives have a lot a lot of hindrances
[28:55] that stay in the way that stand in the
[28:57] way of the promises it seems like right
[29:02] but your faith
[29:05] you got to realize that your faith is
[29:07] not
[29:08] it's not this thing right here it's not
[29:10] tied to this thing right here it's not
[29:12] even tied to the five senses that we
[29:15] have in our bodies
[29:17] those five things that god give us to
[29:18] and i'm not going to try to try to
[29:19] remember them all because i never do i
[29:21] always leave them out and get them in
[29:22] the wrong order but those five things
[29:24] that god give us to to contact our
[29:26] earthly home with
[29:29] your faith is not even tied to that
[29:32] your faith is in a place it's down in a
[29:34] realm it's down inside that heart of
[29:36] hearts it's down inside that soul and he
[29:38] said it's not even touched by what you
[29:40] can feel out here he said it has no he
[29:42] said only there's only one or one or
[29:45] another thing that can that can
[29:47] influence that faith he said that's
[29:48] either faith or doubt that's that place
[29:50] in their heart it's either faith or
[29:51] doubt that's it there's nothing else to
[29:53] come into play but we put so much in
[29:55] this thing right here
[29:57] and how we how we feel i just don't feel
[30:00] like it
[30:01] or maybe i did feel like it
[30:04] or whatever it might be you know like
[30:06] that in all the different range and
[30:07] spectrum in between we can have all
[30:09] these areas here we can say but
[30:11] maybe he said that faith has no
[30:12] hindrances but i sure do
[30:15] i have all these things
[30:17] and then we get there and we listen that
[30:19] devil and that devil comes and tells you
[30:20] he says well you know what you shouldn't
[30:22] even pray
[30:24] you don't even need to be praying right
[30:26] now look at what you did or look at what
[30:28] you felt or look at what you thought and
[30:30] all these different things which he's a
[30:31] liar anyways he can't hear your thoughts
[30:34] but he'll tell you he can
[30:36] and he'll bring a wave he'll bring a
[30:38] wave of guilt he'll do something on
[30:39] there that will come down and we'll get
[30:41] to that spot remember it's either faith
[30:43] or doubt down on the inside and if he
[30:44] can influence you through what you feel
[30:46] and how you're acting if he can
[30:48] influence you in such a way to stop that
[30:51] faith from really sinking in right
[30:54] that's all he's trying to do
[30:57] he's playing the game
[30:59] brother branham said he's a bluff
[31:01] say boo devil back
[31:05] and put out a prayer request you know
[31:07] once or twice a week every how many
[31:09] times the things come in we'll put out
[31:10] the prayer requests and everything else
[31:11] and that's
[31:12] a favorite thing of mine just say boo
[31:14] devil back because you know it looks
[31:16] like they're huge devils
[31:18] the blue devil back
[31:23] be a lot of hindrances but my faith has
[31:25] no hindrances
[31:27] faith knows no
[31:29] hindrances
[31:32] so faith didn't you know faith knew no
[31:34] hindrances as brother branham would say
[31:36] here in this this little mother back
[31:38] there 2 000 years ago
[31:41] it did not know
[31:42] hindrances
[31:44] in brother branham's day 50
[31:47] 60
[31:49] 70 years ago now
[31:52] we've come a long ways ain't we
[31:55] i remember when i come into the message
[31:56] it's only been 33 years ago when i come
[31:58] into the message
[32:01] and man i thought it was on then i mean
[32:03] we're going home brother dale
[32:05] i mean i remember i remember you from 30
[32:07] years ago we were going home wasn't we
[32:09] we were going home
[32:11] here i stand 33 years later a little bit
[32:14] more stooped a lot more gray hair and my
[32:16] skin looks a little bit more like paper
[32:18] than it used to do
[32:20] yeah
[32:21] and all these things and i think man now
[32:23] the brother brown that was 50 60 70
[32:26] years ago and all the things that have
[32:29] hindrances we could say many hindrances
[32:33] brother branham faced many hindrances
[32:36] what about when
[32:38] sister hope
[32:40] and little sharon rhodes got sick and
[32:42] and passed over
[32:46] that's a great hindrance
[32:50] now we're coming through the well i
[32:52] guess you could call it the days of
[32:53] covid we've had many hindrances many
[32:55] have passed on friends and family loved
[32:57] ones
[32:58] brothers and sisters in christ
[33:05] when he's there and
[33:07] little sharon rose is suffering such and
[33:09] she's about to go and he's praying and
[33:10] he said the heavens became his brass
[33:14] that'd be a major hindrance wouldn't it
[33:16] when he got a need such as that but the
[33:18] heavens become his brass
[33:21] he said god closed the curtain and
[33:23] wouldn't even hear and pray
[33:28] and that devil began speaking began
[33:30] getting up there and speaking in that
[33:31] ear and began to tell him he said after
[33:32] all those ones that you prayed for he
[33:34] said he didn't tell me that god wasn't a
[33:36] healer he said he couldn't say that
[33:38] because i knew better than that
[33:41] he said he had faith with it he knew he
[33:43] knew that he said he couldn't tell me
[33:44] that that god wasn't a healer because
[33:46] i'd seen too many things but what he
[33:47] could do he could get up there and start
[33:49] twisting like he does and he began to
[33:51] talk to him and said he said oh after
[33:53] all those ones that you have prayed for
[33:56] and god has healed but he won't heal
[33:58] your little sharon rose and there's your
[34:01] wife laying there in the morgue
[34:04] god didn't hear you god will not hear
[34:06] you and he said you know what he said i
[34:08] said you're right devil
[34:11] and if god was such a good god and this
[34:13] and that and everything else he said you
[34:15] know the thing if it was the hard part
[34:17] was is that the devil was literally
[34:19] telling him the truth
[34:23] can you imagine a rotten devil
[34:26] telling the truth
[34:28] that's just sickening and perverted in
[34:30] itself
[34:32] and yet here's this devil he's telling
[34:33] the truth and he he said he said i was
[34:36] just about right about ready so i was
[34:38] almost i was fixing to say you say he
[34:40] had hindrances
[34:44] he's trying to pray for something but
[34:46] you know
[34:47] you would have to say it was god's will
[34:49] to take her home
[34:52] and he said i was fixing to say i'm
[34:53] through
[34:55] i'm done
[34:56] if that's the way you're going to treat
[34:58] me i'm done
[35:00] many hindrances right
[35:02] but faith has no hindrances
[35:05] and down on the inside he said before i
[35:07] could say it there was something began
[35:09] to move down on the inside there was
[35:11] something down on the inside in here
[35:12] that began to came up and said and
[35:14] without even him he said i didn't even
[35:15] really think he's just boiled up from
[35:17] the inside and comes out and says you
[35:19] know the lord giveth the lord taketh
[35:21] away blessed be the name of the lord
[35:24] glory to god hallelujah
[35:27] there was a faith that was moving right
[35:30] it was beyond him it was not him it was
[35:32] beyond him there was something that was
[35:34] there and i think too many times we
[35:36] still we try to go to this thing right
[35:38] here and our feelings our thoughts our
[35:39] understandings and we try to to bring up
[35:42] a faith the level of faith that can
[35:43] withstand the devil in this hour and
[35:45] we're doing it right here but this thing
[35:48] has many hindrances it's right here
[35:50] where the faith has to come up from
[35:53] there has to be a genuine revelation
[35:57] not just a revelation
[35:59] don't get me wrong this might sound
[36:01] wrong here but bear with me a second
[36:04] not just a revelation that there's a
[36:05] such thing called a serpent seed and not
[36:08] just a revelation that there's a certain
[36:09] there's certain group called the
[36:10] predestinated and not just a certain
[36:12] revelation of water baptism in the name
[36:14] of of the lord jesus christ and not the
[36:17] trinity and everything else not just all
[36:19] the different things of doctrines that
[36:20] we can check off that we're so happy
[36:22] about from this message but you've got
[36:24] to have something that goes beyond that
[36:25] down the inside that says not only is he
[36:27] god but i'm his child
[36:32] i am that predestinated amen
[36:35] i am that blood washed saint
[36:37] i am that one he's talking about and if
[36:39] there's one from george georgia that's
[36:41] going
[36:44] right
[36:46] right
[36:47] i'm not gonna be exclusive with me only
[36:49] i say we're all gonna go how about that
[36:51] praise the lord amen i want us all to go
[36:55] as one body how about that there's one
[36:56] going it's the body of jesus christ
[36:58] that's who's going from georgia right
[37:00] praise the lord
[37:01] [Applause]
[37:03] i had a brother one time that was they
[37:05] called me and he didn't have a pastor he
[37:07] wouldn't sit under a pastor
[37:09] a lot of the problem wasn't it
[37:11] but he uh
[37:12] he made a statement he said he said
[37:14] brother branham said there's three kind
[37:15] of believers in every congregation i
[37:16] said yes he said that
[37:19] he said have you identified yours yet i
[37:20] said mercy man
[37:22] what are you talking about
[37:25] he said well you should be able to
[37:26] identify the three kind of believers in
[37:28] your church he said there's three kind
[37:29] of believers that are there and i said
[37:30] listen brother i know what he said and i
[37:31] believe what he said i said but you know
[37:33] if i can't look at my everyone that's
[37:35] sitting in that congregation and say you
[37:36] are my brother and you are my brother
[37:37] and you are my sister and we're all
[37:39] going together i said something's wrong
[37:40] i can't preach to you the way i'm
[37:41] supposed to preach to you
[37:44] that's right
[37:45] i'll just let god figure out the rest of
[37:47] it right
[37:48] i want us all to be there amen i want us
[37:50] all to be together right
[37:52] amen praise the lord
[37:54] there's something about that faith
[37:56] though there's something about the faith
[37:57] on the inside there's something about
[37:58] that oh my that that regardless of the
[38:01] circumstances and regardless of the
[38:03] feelings and all the different things
[38:04] that you're going through as grim and as
[38:06] hard as they are still this faith holds
[38:11] still this faith holds and i just want
[38:13] to say this morning that that faith is
[38:15] still unhindered
[38:18] it was unhindered in jesus's day it was
[38:21] unhindered in brother branham's day and
[38:23] it's unhindered in our day also brothers
[38:26] and sisters
[38:28] it is just as unhindered now as it ever
[38:31] was only believe all things are possible
[38:35] they're still possible amen
[38:38] praise the lord last week we were
[38:40] praying for a sister she's actually in
[38:41] kentucky it's the sister of our the
[38:43] mother of our song leader sister rhonda
[38:45] goat and and she she
[38:47] she called or sent out a prayer request
[38:49] through her son said pray for us said
[38:51] that
[38:51] and there's many praying for not just us
[38:53] as many people around the around the
[38:54] country praying i'm sure but she said
[38:56] she went to the doctor she had coven a
[38:59] few months ago and it was a really bad
[39:00] case i mean she was having a hard hard
[39:02] time it took her a long time to get over
[39:04] she's a nurse took her a long time to
[39:06] get over she finally gets over it and
[39:08] now she started having heart problems
[39:10] and and they went and they began doing
[39:12] tests and they found that she had a
[39:13] leaking valve
[39:15] and the covet had hit her heart and she
[39:17] had a leaking valve and because of that
[39:19] leaking valve and something else that
[39:20] was going on they said that their her
[39:23] her organs were not getting enough
[39:25] oxygen so the heart was not not moving
[39:27] the oxygenated blood into her organs
[39:30] like it was supposed to do it's a very
[39:31] serious thing
[39:33] they said we're going to have to do
[39:34] surgery and fix that valve and we'll
[39:36] probably have to treat the rest with
[39:38] medication you really don't there's not
[39:40] much we can do for it
[39:43] and then the saints prayed
[39:46] and then the saints prayed
[39:50] a few days later we got word back she
[39:52] went back to the doctor and the doctor
[39:53] said man it turned 180 so you don't need
[39:55] surgery you don't need medicine
[39:58] right praise the lord
[40:01] praise the lord
[40:03] all things are still
[40:07] still
[40:08] possible
[40:14] i stand up here my legs feel like
[40:16] they're about to give out my eyes are
[40:17] about to close up and everything's just
[40:19] shaking and
[40:20] and just brother dale knows some of the
[40:22] things that you've been through and we
[40:24] still stand here and we still tell you
[40:25] that all things are still possible
[40:29] it don't matter whether it happens today
[40:31] whether it happens tomorrow or whether
[40:33] it happens 25 years from now it does not
[40:36] happen does not matter
[40:39] because faith is unhindered
[40:42] faith is unhindered
[40:44] only believe saints
[40:47] only believe
[40:51] and these days there are so many
[40:54] troubles
[40:55] so many
[40:57] sicknesses so many
[41:01] loved ones and brothers and sisters in
[41:03] the lord that have gone on and different
[41:05] ones and and we look at our life and our
[41:07] day-to-day life and all that we go
[41:09] through and
[41:11] all that we have to face as we go
[41:12] through our days here below and
[41:15] just seems like there's so many
[41:16] insurmountable obstacles
[41:20] challenges that are just way beyond us
[41:23] i mean way behind us right
[41:27] when you're young you think that you've
[41:29] got the bull by the horns man you can do
[41:31] it you can you can steer it where you
[41:32] want to steer it and
[41:35] you don't feel the aches and the pains
[41:37] and the different things
[41:40] but there's just so many there's older
[41:41] you get you find out there's so much
[41:42] that you can't do
[41:44] right there's just so many uncertainties
[41:46] that we have no power over
[41:49] right brother dale would you have
[41:50] thought you know the first year going
[41:52] into the first year that you would be
[41:53] you know where you are right now that
[41:54] you had to go through the the stroke and
[41:56] all these things you never would think
[41:58] that
[42:02] but we have we have no power over things
[42:08] in our flesh we have no power
[42:10] and i think that's one of the
[42:12] i think that's one of the the hardest
[42:14] things for me to get my mind around and
[42:16] really to get a grasp on maybe it's
[42:17] because i'm still young enough that i
[42:19] that i still want to do that you know i
[42:21] still want to be able to control things
[42:22] i still want to but i have no power to
[42:24] change any of it
[42:27] not in this flesh man i don't but you
[42:29] see the thing is but then my anchor
[42:31] kicks in
[42:35] but then my anchor kicks in and it gives
[42:37] me a great big check you know to chunk
[42:40] that dog can run out there ever so far
[42:43] but after a while there's the end he
[42:44] hits the end of that chain and chunk
[42:48] it was flip plumb back around i trained
[42:50] bird dogs for a while and in my they
[42:52] would run out there and you put them on
[42:53] a you put them on a a training rope a
[42:55] check rope and they would run out there
[42:56] and you wanted to run out so far but
[42:58] when you said whoa you wanted them to
[43:00] whoa they they couldn't there was no
[43:02] halting they had to stop right on the
[43:04] dime and the way you do that you take
[43:06] that rope and you let them hit it a
[43:08] couple times until they learn after a
[43:10] while they would be listening they may
[43:11] be running 90 miles an hour but they had
[43:13] that ear in the wind and as soon as you
[43:15] said whoa
[43:17] they put the brakes on
[43:19] right because they knew
[43:21] that's what that anchor on the inside
[43:23] the believer is it's a check down inside
[43:25] there amen this flesh will carry you
[43:26] ever so far it can go through ever so
[43:29] many hindrances it can go through ever
[43:31] so many things and you can say oh woe is
[43:33] me and this hurts and that hurts and i'm
[43:35] sick and i don't feel good and i don't
[43:36] know if this is ever going to end but
[43:38] after a while there's something on the
[43:39] inside that says check
[43:41] and you say i'm a son of god hallelujah
[43:43] god's heal me i don't care if i feel it
[43:45] now he has already healed me
[43:48] he has already done the work it's a
[43:50] finished work right
[43:53] praise the lord
[43:56] in this flesh we are nothing
[44:00] in this flesh we are weak
[44:04] in this flesh we have no power
[44:07] but in the spirit i am a son of the most
[44:09] high god
[44:11] and every devil of hell is subject to me
[44:17] to quote brother david gadman
[44:19] amen
[44:23] if you know brother david you know what
[44:24] i'm talking about
[44:26] that's a great big so
[44:29] be it is what that is right
[44:33] i love brother david amen
[44:36] if ever there's a time to only believe
[44:38] now now is the time to do that just only
[44:40] believe amen everything else is falling
[44:41] apart you might as well try belief right
[44:45] faith this is it saints
[44:49] so in light of all the battles that we
[44:50] face and weary as we are many times
[44:52] through all the ups and downs of life
[44:53] and the struggles and all these things i
[44:55] ask you this has our faith grown weaker
[45:00] that's the part where you say no
[45:06] no
[45:08] no sir
[45:09] no way
[45:10] no how
[45:12] my faith is just as strong now as it's
[45:13] ever been
[45:16] that's what your prophet said he said
[45:17] faith has no hindrances faith knows no
[45:19] hindrances right
[45:21] faith today is just as strong as it was
[45:22] 70 years ago listen it wasn't brother
[45:24] branham's faith it was the faith of the
[45:26] lord working through brother branham
[45:28] and it's not your faith it's the faith
[45:30] the sovereign gift of god is god's faith
[45:33] working through his bride to bring his
[45:35] word to pass to bring his word to
[45:37] manifestation in some he has to bring it
[45:40] through a sickness in their body to show
[45:41] healing amen in other words he brings a
[45:43] sickness in the body to show a a
[45:46] endurance or something he's got many
[45:48] different purposes in his way but all
[45:50] these things he gives you faith to go
[45:53] through this to manifest his word
[45:55] it is a gift of god
[46:00] and your faith is unhindered
[46:03] because if you can hinder your faith you
[46:05] can hinder god
[46:08] i look that word up unhindered
[46:11] are you okay for a few more minutes
[46:13] amen
[46:14] i looked that word up that word
[46:15] unhindered
[46:16] oh man it's an awesome word
[46:19] it's a wonderfully positive word here i
[46:22] think we need some positivity from time
[46:23] to time amen
[46:26] unhindered is defined as unobstructed
[46:30] our faith is unobstructed
[46:34] faith has no obstructions in its way
[46:37] right
[46:38] that's pretty awesome
[46:39] right
[46:41] unhindered unobstructed
[46:44] now again now i'm not trying to be your
[46:46] spiritual cheerleader here this morning
[46:48] that's not what i'm trying to do you can
[46:49] take it or leave it
[46:50] it's totally up to you but i just wanted
[46:52] to put the devil on notice this morning
[46:54] and say i believe
[46:56] in my faith that there is no
[46:58] obstructions that you can throw in my
[46:59] way that's going to stop that faith
[47:02] we see that's how you have to do it
[47:04] right
[47:05] you've got to recognize what's faith
[47:08] in you what's faith and or what's just
[47:10] your mental makeup what you're thinking
[47:12] your intellectual understanding of it or
[47:14] whatever you've got to be able to get
[47:15] down to a point you say listen there's
[47:17] an anchor down there i just can't move
[47:18] past
[47:21] when the when the all the
[47:25] the signed stuff
[47:26] believe the sign junk started going
[47:28] through and turning and doing all the
[47:29] things and people started leaving right
[47:31] and left
[47:33] we lost some
[47:37] and all the different things and the
[47:38] arguments that bring up and this and
[47:40] that and just so much and man i'll just
[47:42] tell you
[47:43] as a pastor i thought it was my duty to
[47:45] go in and really just research this
[47:47] stuff out and just look at what they
[47:48] were saying i had to i was going to find
[47:50] an answer
[47:53] and i did find an answer to a lot of it
[47:55] but i'll be honest with you there was a
[47:56] lot of stuff there for days it was hard
[48:00] and it would rock you to your core
[48:03] and i would tell you within a i mean
[48:05] just without a hesitation don't do it
[48:09] don't go there
[48:11] don't even pay it no mine
[48:14] and after going through that stuff for
[48:16] months and months and months and pouring
[48:18] through that stuff i come to this
[48:20] conclusion that no matter how much how
[48:22] many rebuttals i can make and how much
[48:24] intellectually i could come back and say
[48:26] yeah but this and you changed that and
[48:28] they did they changed a lot of words to
[48:29] make it say that they say brother and
[48:31] make him say something that he didn't
[48:32] say and then they would take him out of
[48:34] context or then they would take some
[48:36] maybe he did say that here but you've
[48:37] got to understand he's a man that's
[48:39] sitting there in a natural natural
[48:40] reality seeing something and explaining
[48:42] what he's saying naturally but yet
[48:44] supernatural is going on how in the
[48:45] world do you do
[48:46] that there's all sorts of things but one
[48:49] thing i came to is this it don't matter
[48:51] how well i can intellectually understand
[48:53] it or explain it or or or give a
[48:55] rebuttal to the to the arguments or
[48:57] whatever it might be it didn't matter
[48:59] because it wasn't going to touch that
[49:01] because we wasn't really i should i was
[49:02] trying to get to a place of faith and
[49:04] you can't do that through
[49:05] intellectualism
[49:07] you can't do it
[49:08] i saw a debate between a an atheist
[49:12] a well-known very famous atheist um
[49:15] hitchens i don't know if any of you ever
[49:16] heard of hitchens but
[49:17] hitchens and and a doctor of theology
[49:21] and and this man he said right from the
[49:22] start it was a two-hour debate it was
[49:24] really interesting i like watching stuff
[49:25] like that and and it was really
[49:27] interesting but the the the the
[49:29] christians sat there and he said all
[49:30] right right from the start the first
[49:32] question he said i want to ask you
[49:33] something he said if i could
[49:36] if i could could explain this in such a
[49:38] way if i could prove to you beyond a
[49:40] shadow of a doubt if i could bring you
[49:43] proof that god exists
[49:47] and that jesus is his name
[49:51] and for a lot of people that's two
[49:52] different things
[49:54] that god exists and jesus is his name
[49:57] will you become a christian
[50:00] and the the atheist kitchen screamed out
[50:02] of meeting no
[50:05] i mean just just like that spittle
[50:07] flying
[50:09] i mean no just just just you i mean it's
[50:12] just crazy to see his face
[50:16] and turk looks at him and he says or
[50:18] looks at the camera and looks at the
[50:20] moderator he says see
[50:22] that's the problem
[50:24] the problem is not right here the
[50:26] problem is right here
[50:29] because we understand a lot of things
[50:30] right here but you got to believe from
[50:32] your heart
[50:33] and it don't matter how much proof you
[50:35] can show this right here if that right
[50:37] there ain't right it ain't going to work
[50:39] and i could go to believe the sign and i
[50:41] could show them a lot of things right
[50:42] here i could explain a lot of things and
[50:44] i have right here and everything else
[50:46] and it does not change a thing
[50:50] and i have talked to to saints to people
[50:52] afterwards that having problems with
[50:53] this and that because of that and i can
[50:55] go and i can explain it with this right
[50:57] here
[50:59] but it does not change a thing
[51:02] and what i've come to find out is like
[51:03] herding cats people are going to do what
[51:06] people are going to do they're going to
[51:07] do what they want to do every time and
[51:09] it's a thing that's in their heart is
[51:10] what it is
[51:12] but aren't you so thankful
[51:15] for an unobstructed faith
[51:17] that when all these things come up and
[51:19] all the
[51:20] you can still sit there and you can say
[51:21] you know what but i still believe
[51:25] i don't care what you tell me i still
[51:27] believe i don't care what you say about
[51:28] about the prophet i still believe that
[51:30] god sent this prophet i still believe
[51:32] this this message is the revelation for
[51:35] an end time bride i still believe every
[51:36] bit of this amen hallelujah because
[51:38] there's an anchor on the inside there's
[51:40] something that raises up right there and
[51:42] said this is true no matter there is no
[51:45] obstruction to it
[51:48] it is unhindered
[51:51] there are no obstacles in its way
[51:55] he can throw obstacles before our eyes
[51:57] he can throw obstacles to our mind he
[51:59] can do all these things to our natural
[52:01] understanding
[52:03] the natural part can be hindered
[52:06] but you see for the bride she goes
[52:08] beyond the natural to the supernatural
[52:11] faith is not hindered
[52:14] unhindered means to not be restrained
[52:19] it's not to be restrained
[52:21] or held back
[52:24] it's unobstructed
[52:26] not restrained
[52:27] it's not healed back
[52:29] that's your faith
[52:31] you know i just finished reading through
[52:32] the the book of john again
[52:35] and and in there
[52:36] there are a few times when the pharisees
[52:38] and the sadducees would surround jesus
[52:40] and the scribes they would surround
[52:41] jesus with ill intent in their heart
[52:44] they would have stones in their hands
[52:45] about ready to
[52:46] to stone him right
[52:48] that's putting it mildly
[52:50] but but but the scripture says that
[52:51] jesus would just pass right through
[52:53] their midst i always liked that he just
[52:55] passed right through
[52:57] or or they would say he escaped out of
[52:59] their hands he just slid right out of
[53:01] their hands right
[53:02] and it wouldn't affect him he'd go right
[53:04] to the next place and he'd keep right on
[53:06] preaching he'd keep right on doing this
[53:08] all the miracles and the signs and the
[53:09] wonders and all the different things
[53:11] what's the bottom line the bottom line
[53:12] was they could not restrain him
[53:16] they couldn't hold him back they
[53:18] couldn't stop the word they couldn't
[53:19] stop the message it was going forth they
[53:21] could not stop that why because you see
[53:23] he was the revelation of the invisible
[53:26] god made visible in flesh and blood
[53:29] right
[53:30] he knew his time was not yet
[53:33] that's why paul could stand up on a ship
[53:34] that was about to be torn to pieces and
[53:36] say listen if you'll stay with me
[53:38] there'll be no lie no loss of life why
[53:40] could he say that he could say that
[53:41] because he had a revelation he had a
[53:44] word of god directly from the angel
[53:46] himself that told him you're going to go
[53:48] stand before caesar right he had that so
[53:51] what's a little what's a little
[53:52] shipwreck here and there
[53:54] what's a few animals tearing you at the
[53:56] flesh here and there what's what's the
[53:58] 30 or 40 lashes save one here and there
[54:01] what are all these things it don't
[54:02] matter what they do to me it don't
[54:04] matter what happens because god said i'm
[54:06] going to be over there and if he said
[54:07] i'm going to go see caesar guess what
[54:09] i'm going to go see caesar
[54:11] and if god said i'm going to make it
[54:13] through in this day guess what i'm going
[54:14] to make it through if god said i'm going
[54:17] to take a body change and i'm going to
[54:18] go on a rapture praise the lord i'm
[54:20] going to take a body change and i'm
[54:21] going to go on the
[54:22] rapture i don't have to know what's
[54:25] happening in between i've just got to go
[54:28] to that faith on the inside and say it's
[54:30] going to be because god said so
[54:32] my faith is unhindered
[54:36] now there's lots of things that happen
[54:38] in between
[54:39] things that really get us going
[54:42] things that we said man i had no clue i
[54:44] had no clue that would have ever
[54:45] happened in my life this is not where i
[54:47] thought i was going to be what's it
[54:48] matter what i think i'm going to be or
[54:50] where i think i'm going to be it's where
[54:52] i know i'm going to be and i know i'm
[54:53] going to be there with him
[54:56] amen
[54:58] you see the devil cannot restrain
[55:01] that
[55:03] he cannot restrain that
[55:06] that revelation is unhindered by the ill
[55:08] intents of those that are around them
[55:10] amen
[55:12] you read over into the book of acts and
[55:13] you find the disciples there and they're
[55:14] locked up put in jail i mean they're in
[55:17] jail right they are put in jail
[55:20] a lot worse than our jails
[55:23] sounds like a hindrance to me
[55:26] but not to god
[55:28] because god had a word of revelation
[55:29] that had to be preached
[55:32] and their faith could not be hindered
[55:36] their revelation could not be hindered
[55:38] so the angel lord just went down there
[55:39] picked them up and you know took them
[55:41] out of the jail cell where they were and
[55:42] they were found the next morning in the
[55:45] temple preaching the name of jesus
[55:47] christ right
[55:50] the high priest called for them and said
[55:51] loose them out of the jail cell and
[55:53] bring them to me
[55:55] how do you lose something that was
[55:56] unbound to begin with
[56:00] our faith our
[56:02] true faith knows no bounds it's not
[56:05] bound it's not it's not restricted it's
[56:08] not restrained it is unhindered all we
[56:11] have to do is just abide
[56:13] in jesus he said if you abide in me
[56:17] and my words abide in you you shall ask
[56:19] what you will and it shall be done to
[56:21] you
[56:25] the high priest said bring them up here
[56:30] they went down they looked they came
[56:31] they said there's bars there and there's
[56:33] jails there and there's there's guards
[56:35] there there's weapons there but there
[56:37] ain't no disciples there
[56:39] they ain't there
[56:41] they're up in the temple preaching
[56:44] and proclaiming the name of jesus
[56:49] unhindered
[56:50] also means listen this part here
[56:53] unhindered also means without anyone or
[56:56] anything making it difficult to do
[56:58] something or force something to happen
[57:00] it's not slowed or blocked or interfered
[57:03] with
[57:05] so all things are not only possible but
[57:08] they're actually easy
[57:10] with faith
[57:12] now boy don't that just fly in your face
[57:17] don't that just fly in your face it's
[57:19] easy with faith it's easy if this is
[57:21] easy why do you struggle so much dutch
[57:25] right
[57:26] because you see i've got many many
[57:28] hindrances but my faith has none
[57:31] jesus walked down along the way one day
[57:33] and he wasn't hungry and in his body he
[57:35] was tired weary and hungry
[57:38] now i don't know if jesus got hangry
[57:40] sorry for that but you know when i get
[57:42] that way when my wife should say that
[57:44] when i get that way
[57:45] if i get hungry and tired and weary like
[57:47] that i get hangry you know there's a
[57:49] little bit of anger a little bit of
[57:50] hunger and they mix together and it's
[57:52] hangry
[57:53] feed me and i'm just like yo
[57:55] everything's just fine then you know
[57:59] but jesus is tired weary and hungry and
[58:02] he's walking along the way and
[58:04] and there's a fig tree and he he sees a
[58:06] fig tree by the way and he said hey
[58:07] that's gonna fix it that's that's gonna
[58:09] i'll feel better i just need to get some
[58:11] food in my body you know so he he walks
[58:13] over to the tree and huh
[58:15] there's no figs on that tree
[58:18] and he curses it and just walks on
[58:21] right he just he curses the tree and he
[58:23] just walks on the disciples i can just
[58:26] imagine the disciples you know they're
[58:27] following you you know they would follow
[58:28] right in his footsteps right just like
[58:30] we're supposed to do so if jesus is
[58:31] walking along in a straight line can i
[58:33] get down for a second so if jesus is
[58:34] walking down in a straight line there
[58:36] right behind him in a straight line
[58:37] perhaps maybe i don't know how it would
[58:38] go but then he'd see a tree and he said
[58:40] hey let's go look at the tree this fig
[58:42] tree so i'm sure they just stayed
[58:44] diverted and they went right over there
[58:45] they began falling what is he doing they
[58:47] go over there and they see him look at
[58:48] that fig tree
[58:50] and then he curses the fig tree
[58:52] and then he walks on and the disciple
[58:55] says they're following him you know
[58:56] right by that fig tree they look and
[58:58] they say huh
[59:00] it's a fig tree with no figs
[59:02] nothing's happened
[59:05] what's going to happen nothing happens
[59:06] and they walk by one by one and all of
[59:08] them look at that tree and they walk
[59:09] down the road i can imagine they're
[59:10] walking down the road they're still
[59:11] looking to that tree
[59:14] what's happening
[59:15] he cursed the fig tree
[59:17] i want to see what's going to happen to
[59:18] the fig tree
[59:20] jesus spoke something's got to happen
[59:22] right right
[59:24] but nothing happened
[59:26] and jesus didn't make no big deal of it
[59:27] he just walked on i'm sure that i'm sure
[59:29] that it was just something that he
[59:30] didn't even think about again right in
[59:33] fact i know it was because the prophet i
[59:34] didn't bring the quote forgive me but i
[59:36] know it was because the prophet said
[59:37] that jesus had an
[59:39] unconscious faith
[59:43] he didn't even have to think about it
[59:47] now again before you say that's jesus
[59:50] or that's brother branham you remember
[59:52] brother branham going into the into the
[59:53] field and there's the bulls and bulls
[59:54] chasing and everything else but brother
[59:55] brahm said love overcame he said it
[59:57] wasn't me it was love projected out to
[59:59] the bull right when love projects
[1:00:02] and the bees the hornets come out and
[1:00:03] all these things we say oh that was
[1:00:05] brother branham
[1:00:07] can i tell it
[1:00:09] my wife sitting here saying whoops
[1:00:12] you as a preacher one thing you don't do
[1:00:13] is you don't start telling stories about
[1:00:14] your wife when you're preaching but i'm
[1:00:15] going to tell you one anyways
[1:00:20] so she was so she she had this this
[1:00:22] wasps nest when i came in one day from
[1:00:23] work and there's a watson that's
[1:00:24] building on her porch and i said i need
[1:00:26] to get rid of that wasp-ness
[1:00:28] and she said no no no
[1:00:29] me and those wasps have a deal
[1:00:32] i'm not going to bother them and they're
[1:00:33] not going to bother me you know i'm
[1:00:35] going to love them they're going to be
[1:00:36] okay
[1:00:37] that's fine in the springtime in the
[1:00:39] summertime but as you get closer to the
[1:00:40] end of the summer time i don't know if
[1:00:42] you've noticed or not but wasps and
[1:00:43] yellowjackets and stuff like that they
[1:00:44] get a little angry too they get they get
[1:00:46] kind of agitated and i came home one day
[1:00:49] and that waspness was gone
[1:00:52] and she said you know what that wasp
[1:00:54] broke his deal
[1:00:58] it stung her
[1:01:00] and she got rid of the wasps
[1:01:03] amen
[1:01:06] but jesus when he walks alone it's just
[1:01:08] an unconscious faith he didn't have to
[1:01:10] think about it he didn't have to try to
[1:01:12] love him he didn't have to try to do
[1:01:14] this or anything else it was just it was
[1:01:17] unhindered there was it was just easy
[1:01:19] there was no there was no obstructions
[1:01:20] there was nothing like that it was
[1:01:22] unconscious to him brother branham said
[1:01:23] i found that very amazing when the
[1:01:25] prophet made that statement that he it
[1:01:27] was an unconscious faith i thought how
[1:01:29] in the world is an unconscious faith
[1:01:30] because when i go to praying for
[1:01:32] something like that i'm consciously
[1:01:34] thinking okay lord he's going to do this
[1:01:36] god is going to do this the word says
[1:01:37] this and god's going to do this and this
[1:01:39] is the way it's going to be and you know
[1:01:40] what sometimes it's not
[1:01:44] and then i get all down and into molly
[1:01:46] grubs and everything else because it's
[1:01:47] not and i think what in the world
[1:01:49] happened you see it's because i have
[1:01:51] hindrances and i wasn't pulling down to
[1:01:53] true faith i was sitting right here
[1:01:55] trying to have an intellectual knowledge
[1:01:57] of what it should be and when it didn't
[1:01:59] happen the devil could come sit there
[1:02:00] and say see i told you so
[1:02:03] but how many times is it when you pray
[1:02:05] for something and you just turn it over
[1:02:06] to the lord
[1:02:07] amen
[1:02:08] and you just go on walking
[1:02:11] and after a while you'll just kind of
[1:02:13] look around one day and it's just there
[1:02:15] you know it's just something you say man
[1:02:16] i didn't even see that in coming
[1:02:19] you say thank you lord
[1:02:22] you see it's because your faith is
[1:02:23] unhindered and god's going to do things
[1:02:24] in his own time
[1:02:26] he does things in his own time
[1:02:29] can you imagine what it must have been
[1:02:30] when the disciples come back the next
[1:02:31] day and they walk back by and jesus
[1:02:34] don't he's not even thinking about that
[1:02:35] fig tree anymore
[1:02:37] he just goes right on walking and
[1:02:38] perhaps right down the path through
[1:02:40] there and perhaps the disciples they
[1:02:42] know
[1:02:43] they are thinking and they're coming up
[1:02:44] and they're thinking maybe just me just
[1:02:46] dramatizing a little bit but i can just
[1:02:47] imagine because i know what i'd be doing
[1:02:48] right and as they're coming along that
[1:02:50] trail they say you know what just over
[1:02:51] that hill over there there's a fig tree
[1:02:53] that jesus cursed yesterday let's go see
[1:02:55] what happened and as jesus walks down
[1:02:58] the path maybe they just kind of took a
[1:02:59] quick detour to go up there and look at
[1:03:00] that fig tree to see what and they were
[1:03:03] amazed because it was it was dead it had
[1:03:05] withered from the roots up right
[1:03:08] it had withered from the roots up
[1:03:11] oh
[1:03:12] praise the lord
[1:03:15] you just speak the word and let god take
[1:03:17] care of it he'll hit it at the roots and
[1:03:20] it'll work his way up hallelujah you
[1:03:22] don't have to see it you don't have to
[1:03:24] think about it you don't have to worry
[1:03:25] about it amen he struck it at the roots
[1:03:28] and it's got to be just what he said
[1:03:31] hallelujah
[1:03:33] praise the lord
[1:03:36] oh perhaps we don't see anything
[1:03:38] we don't see it with our natural eyes
[1:03:42] but we ain't looking with our natural
[1:03:43] eyes anyways
[1:03:45] we ain't supposed to be looking with our
[1:03:47] natural eyes anyways brother aaron we're
[1:03:49] not supposed to be looking at it and
[1:03:50] saying oh you know this is the way it's
[1:03:52] got to be that's the problem but we're
[1:03:54] supposed to be looking with our eagle
[1:03:55] eyes
[1:03:56] with the eyes of our theophany
[1:03:59] brother branham said oh i better stop
[1:04:01] brother branham said he said theophany
[1:04:03] is only like in his day he said that
[1:04:04] theophany is only it's like 20 feet away
[1:04:07] in another dimension moving faster than
[1:04:10] we are
[1:04:11] right that's what he said
[1:04:14] he said but oh my one day we're going to
[1:04:16] meet
[1:04:17] but he said when in another he said when
[1:04:19] you hear he said when you recognize that
[1:04:22] the word of god is eagle food
[1:04:26] you have heard from your theophany
[1:04:30] oh
[1:04:31] praise god hallelujah
[1:04:34] we have been feeding upon this word and
[1:04:36] feeding upon this word we have been
[1:04:38] feeding upon this word for 40 50 60
[1:04:41] years some of us
[1:04:42] 33 years on this word and i tell you
[1:04:45] this we're closer today to that
[1:04:46] theophany that we ever have i don't
[1:04:48] think we're near so far away from that
[1:04:50] theophany now as we were when we started
[1:04:52] i don't think that we i don't think that
[1:04:54] not sometimes we're not even 20 feet
[1:04:56] away it's right here
[1:04:59] just in another dimension moving faster
[1:05:01] and when you can come up to the word of
[1:05:03] god and the word of god says something
[1:05:05] and you believe it that faith kicks him
[1:05:06] you're not looking with these natural
[1:05:08] eyes you're looking with those eyes of
[1:05:10] the theophany you're looking through
[1:05:12] that word body the word says this and
[1:05:14] that word what is it the word is in the
[1:05:16] presence of the lord he's in the
[1:05:17] presence of god it's in the presence of
[1:05:19] that shekinah glory there's times when
[1:05:21] we can feel that right
[1:05:23] that portal is open that wind is open we
[1:05:25] begin to feel that what is it you're
[1:05:27] seeing through the eyes of your
[1:05:28] theophany you're hearing through the
[1:05:30] eyes of your theophany you're feeling
[1:05:32] through the body your ethophany amen
[1:05:34] that theophany is right there

[1:05:42] the altar our theophany who are you

[1:06:00] foundation of the world

[1:06:04] make man in our own image that's you
[1:06:08] little bride that's you
[1:06:10] and where is that theophany brother dale
[1:06:12] he said it's in that sixth dimension
[1:06:14] right
[1:06:15] it's in that sixth dimension i said i
[1:06:16] wasn't going to do this i said i wasn't
[1:06:18] going to do this
[1:06:21] okay brother dale can correct me if i
[1:06:23] get something off here later on
[1:06:25] i take correction very good i say yes
[1:06:26] sir that's exactly right
[1:06:29] where is that theophany
[1:06:31] that the often he's there he said it's
[1:06:32] just in that sixth dimension
[1:06:35] he said it's there right up under the
[1:06:37] altar he said that body of the lord
[1:06:39] jesus when it was when it was raised on
[1:06:41] high it went to the it went to the
[1:06:43] throne of mercy it went to the altar of
[1:06:45] sacrifice and he said that body and that
[1:06:47] blood is there upon that altar of
[1:06:48] sacrifice as a propitiation for your sin
[1:06:51] right
[1:06:52] now right under that altar is what the
[1:06:55] theophanies it's the sixth dimension
[1:06:57] that's the seventh dimension where god
[1:06:58] dwells god's dwelling in the seventh
[1:07:00] dimension and right under there is the
[1:07:01] sixth dimension and that presence of god
[1:07:03] is raining down upon them in that sixth
[1:07:05] dimension they're always in the presence
[1:07:07] of god
[1:07:08] glory you can't be one bit sad for your
[1:07:11] loved one that went on leak about where
[1:07:13] they're at thinking about where your
[1:07:14] brothers and sisters are at
[1:07:16] they're there in the presence of god
[1:07:18] continuously in the presence of god
[1:07:20] they're in a body that does not wear out
[1:07:24] i remember years ago my sister-in-law
[1:07:26] got drunk in the lord during the
[1:07:28] in the fellowship meetings i had never
[1:07:30] seen anything like that it struck her
[1:07:32] she screamed she shouted she danced she
[1:07:34] went about every which away and then she
[1:07:36] collapsed
[1:07:38] and she stayed out for a whole day she
[1:07:40] didn't wake up till the next morning
[1:07:43] she went down you go we took her and we
[1:07:45] linger up against the wall at the back
[1:07:46] of the church or the the school building
[1:07:48] where he was at how many went to
[1:07:49] thanksgiving years ago
[1:07:51] and she would we laid her up against the
[1:07:52] wall out in the hall
[1:07:54] and everybody after church you had
[1:07:55] thousand people out there milling around
[1:07:57] you know fellowshipping and having a
[1:07:59] good time and she's sitting there going
[1:08:02] she was just as drunk as drunk could be
[1:08:06] just rest and drunk in the lord
[1:08:10] after everybody for some reason we were
[1:08:11] always about the last ones about one
[1:08:12] o'clock in the morning when they finally
[1:08:14] closed the place down and we had to go
[1:08:16] gather up sister lisa
[1:08:18] carry her out to the car
[1:08:20] put her in the car or the minivan or
[1:08:21] whatever it was at the time put her in
[1:08:23] the car carried to the motel and my dad
[1:08:25] in law and her husband my brother-in-law
[1:08:27] carried her upstairs put her in the bed
[1:08:30] she didn't wake up to the next day what
[1:08:32] happened
[1:08:38] wouldn't you like to get a good dose of
[1:08:39] that again
[1:08:41] right
[1:08:43] well it's real
[1:08:46] and think about it and this body
[1:08:47] couldn't handle that but that body there
[1:08:49] that body and that theophany that body
[1:08:50] he said let us make man in our own image
[1:08:52] do you think that thing has changed that
[1:08:53] thing ain't changed
[1:08:55] when god created it in genesis chapter 1
[1:08:57] there is nothing that has happened
[1:08:59] between genesis chapter 1 and now that
[1:09:00] has diminished that there is nothing
[1:09:02] that has taken away from that there is
[1:09:04] nothing that has that body is unhindered
[1:09:11] that body is resting
[1:09:14] it does not have obstructions
[1:09:16] it does not have anything to restrain it
[1:09:19] it's sitting in the presence of god or
[1:09:21] standing worshiping in the presence of
[1:09:23] god it cannot get tired and it's look
[1:09:26] and look up and it can see the lord
[1:09:27] brother branham said he could see the
[1:09:29] lord on the altar

[1:09:42] that looking at that precious body of
[1:09:44] the lord jesus christ
[1:09:49] but here's the kicker

[1:09:56] god looks this way
[1:09:59] we look up down here we look up and we
[1:10:01] cry out through the blood of jesus and
[1:10:03] brother branham said he don't even see
[1:10:05] us
[1:10:05] what does he see he sees that blood
[1:10:09] what's just beneath that blood the
[1:10:11] theophanies
[1:10:12] he sees those theophanies he sees a word
[1:10:15] body that was created in his image
[1:10:17] perfect from the very beginning it never
[1:10:20] sinned it never fell it's never hurt
[1:10:22] it's never had pain it's never been sad
[1:10:24] it's never it's none of the things that
[1:10:27] don't have the quirks and the faults and
[1:10:28] the problems that we have down here it
[1:10:30] don't have those things and when god
[1:10:32] looks down through his blood he sees
[1:10:34] that perfect body that word that he
[1:10:36] spoke before the foundation of the world
[1:10:38] and we say oh god we did this and we did
[1:10:40] that and god says i don't know what
[1:10:41] you're talking about i'm looking at a
[1:10:43] perfect man

[1:12:17] forgive me if it does but i've told my
[1:12:19] wife and a few others
[1:12:22] i've got a new motto
[1:12:24] when our kids were growing up they
[1:12:25] watched that little
[1:12:27] cartoon of the
[1:12:28] the fish they were trying to find the
[1:12:30] fish or trying to find the fish's sun or
[1:12:33] something i don't know what they were
[1:12:33] doing they're swimming around the ocean
[1:12:36] and there's a little fish down there she
[1:12:38] was crazy she was out of her mind and
[1:12:39] she would say the man was getting the
[1:12:41] boyfish was getting all discouraged and
[1:12:43] all just tore up and everything else
[1:12:45] everything was going wrong it's kind of
[1:12:46] like life it always goes wrong
[1:12:48] seemingly right and he asked her what do
[1:12:51] you do and she said well you know what i
[1:12:52] do i just just keep swimming
[1:12:55] just keep swimming
[1:12:58] right i just keep swimming i said that's
[1:13:00] kind of my motto these days
[1:13:03] nothing's going like i thought it was
[1:13:05] going to go you know nothing really
[1:13:06] worked out like i thought it was going
[1:13:08] to work out but that's okay i'm just
[1:13:09] going to keep swimming
[1:13:12] i'm just going to keep going on brother
[1:13:13] i'm just going to just keep putting i'm
[1:13:15] going to put one foot in front of the
[1:13:16] other
[1:13:17] i'm going to get that other foot
[1:13:19] boom there it's down i'm going to keep
[1:13:21] putting that other there and then i'm
[1:13:22] going
[1:13:24] boom it's down there and as long as
[1:13:25] sometimes i do this number and i do that
[1:13:27] you know sometimes you do that but if i
[1:13:28] can just get that foot down in front of
[1:13:30] me and put my weight forward a little
[1:13:32] bit i can take one more step
[1:13:37] and in doing so i can fulfill the will
[1:13:39] of the lord
[1:13:41] and it's going to be okay
[1:13:43] church it's going to be okay
[1:13:45] it's going to be okay
[1:13:47] because your faith
[1:13:50] is unhindered
[1:13:52] it's not locked in by this body or the
[1:13:54] things that you see
