[18:26] the world you know the world's looking
[18:28] for it
[18:29] they just can't find it Satan puts
[18:31] everything in the world I was thinking
[18:33] while I was watching brother Michael we
[18:36] I watched him since he was a little boy
[18:38] and he's a young man now and I pray that
[18:41] God keep his hand on him cuz he's got a
[18:44] work to do all of you young people you
[18:47] got a work to do cuz we are getting
[18:50] older we were talking yesterday at the
[18:53] post office and somebody said something
[18:55] and I said they said well you're just
[18:57] you know you act like a 30 year old you
[18:59] just you know I run circles around them
[19:02] I got one girl in there she's about 25
[19:03] years old and I don't think she has a
[19:05] second gear just first gear is about all
[19:07] she's got but listen brother Tony if you
[19:09] got a transmission and ain't got but one
[19:10] gear you can't make a second gear she
[19:13] just don't have a second
[19:15] gear but we've seen those and and I told
[19:19] them I said well I said that's pretty
[19:21] good I said but you know I said to Lord
[19:23] terries I only got about 20 good years
[19:25] left I'll be 84 in 20 years so they and
[19:28] they all the whole the whole yeah well
[19:31] some of your older ones bless your heart
[19:33] but uh I mean when you think of it in
[19:35] that aspect you you time is
[19:38] short when you're 25 and 30 years old
[19:40] you do not think about uh Social
[19:42] Security and and which I'll get my first
[19:44] check next month and June June's already
[19:47] drawing hers so you'll be laughing she's
[19:49] older I mean she's um decided to draw
[19:53] hers before it all runs
[19:57] out but
[20:00] but when you look at it in that aspect
[20:01] you really don't have but about you know
[20:03] if you're 64 you may be 20 good years
[20:06] left even to be on this Earth and when
[20:08] you look at it that way I want to think
[20:10] about something
[20:12] greater I want I want to think about
[20:14] something that that carries us just like
[20:16] just like
[20:18] Abraham got the promised son took him 25
[20:21] years to get it but he did get it so
[20:23] we've had a promise in the end time of a
[20:25] body change and of a resurrection and of
[20:28] going in a Rapture and going to another
[20:30] dimension for a little while to till God
[20:32] cleans this nasty Earth off then we're
[20:34] going to come right back down here and
[20:36] we're going to live here not in heaven
[20:38] on a cloud John saw the city coming down
[20:41] out of Heaven John was on Earth so we're
[20:44] going to have a city here this is where
[20:45] we're going to live God made this Earth
[20:46] to be inhabited he didn't make this
[20:48] Earth to be destroyed he made it to be
[20:50] inhabited he loved this Earth so much is
[20:51] where he put us he could have put us
[20:53] somewhere else brother Dy he put us
[20:55] right here in this Earth this is his and
[20:57] this is listen this is is our domain
[20:59] that's right Adam lost it Adam had it he
[21:03] was the god of the
[21:04] earth so what are we going back to
[21:06] Brother John you God can't change his
[21:08] mind we're just going to Loop right back
[21:09] around and we're going to be God of the
[21:10] Earth again amen but let's let let's see
[21:12] a little bit of it I was looking at
[21:14] Watching Sister Jessica in the back and
[21:17] I don't know if all of you know but
[21:18] sister Jessica's uh grandfather was one
[21:21] of our Pastors in at brother Homer
[21:23] Mansfield down in Athens some of you I
[21:26] don't know if some of you went to church
[21:28] there or not but
[21:29] I think Julie did and Janet but
[21:31] different ones but we started here in
[21:33] Gainesville and then we went to to her
[21:35] grandfather's and I've known her family
[21:37] longer than she has but here here we are
[21:40] full circle come back around and here
[21:41] the granddaughter stands in the church
[21:43] singing and uh we sure appreciate sister
[21:45] guest and brother Chris and sister
[21:47] Jessica all and we appreciate
[21:50] them we would have liked it if they'
[21:52] have brought some boys into the mix cuz
[21:54] it looks like all we got girls coming in
[21:56] whatever chromosome that is we ain't
[21:57] been able to figure out how to get a boy
[21:59] chromosone in this church but some of
[22:02] you can
[22:03] start some of us
[22:05] can't but uh but time's fleeting and we
[22:09] got to take every moment that we can for
[22:12] the Lord we've got to we've got this
[22:14] thing is going to end up with a group of
[22:17] people on the Earth called a bride and a
[22:21] bride of the end time a bride that has
[22:23] the message of the end time not a
[22:26] message of the first church age of the
[22:27] second church but a bride in the end
[22:29] time that has the message to call the
[22:31] dead out of the
[22:33] ground it's not going to be a two two
[22:35] two we know that it's going to be a
[22:37] voice and that voice is going to be in
[22:39] the bride and it already is in the bride
[22:41] we just got to get to that all right and
[22:43] and we're striving for that H let me
[22:45] read you what one more quote here look
[22:48] um can't remember who said this but it
[22:50] says nothing ever goes away until it
[22:52] teaches us what we need to know think
[22:55] about that nothing ever goes away until
[22:58] it teach teaches us what we need to know
[22:59] because listen we're Christians and
[23:01] we're
[23:01] Progressive right not Progressive like
[23:04] the world we're Progressive in God that
[23:06] he's always moving and if God's always
[23:08] moving we better get in there with him
[23:10] all right and and these trials we don't
[23:13] stop at trials we go through trials we
[23:16] go through them when we go through them
[23:18] the test it becomes a testimony at the
[23:20] end and then the scars that we
[23:24] have they do not compare with the scars
[23:26] he took for me and you that's right no
[23:28] he physically was nailed to a cross you
[23:30] and I have not had that happen yet but
[23:32] we do need to Bear our cross as
[23:35] Christians and pick up the cross and
[23:37] follow him so God bless you uh brother
[23:40] um Aaron will be speaking for us
[23:41] Wednesday night remember next week end
[23:43] Friday Saturday and Sunday 73 and 9:45
[23:46] we'll have a meal also remember April
[23:48] the
[23:49] 14th uh will be one service and then
[23:52] after the first service need all the men
[23:54] to stay in the sanctuary but my lovely
[23:56] wife told me a few minutes ago she said
[24:00] that a way to a man's heart is to his
[24:02] stomach so y'all go downstairs and eat
[24:05] first then come back up here on April
[24:08] the 14th and we we just have the men
[24:10] come up here and y'all will have a full
[24:12] stomach so instead of grumbling out of
[24:14] your mouth you gr I mean your stomach
[24:16] you can I I didn't say that right I'm
[24:18] sorry but that's not what it's going to
[24:21] be but really go ahead and eat something
[24:23] and then we'll come back up here at
[24:25] about 1:00 April the 14th that's a few
[24:28] weeks from now so uh if you're not like
[24:30] I said if you're not going to be here
[24:31] let me know and we'll run a copy off for
[24:34] you to listen to brother Joe we'll not
[24:36] put it online but we'll have it for just
[24:39] for the church okay uh we love you we
[24:42] love you with the love of the lord we
[24:44] love your
[24:46] soul flesh every once in a while I don't
[24:50] know but brother Dale's always said he
[24:52] said what he said I'm talking to your
[24:56] soul if you can ever get that soul
[24:58] to
[24:59] respond then he's got something to hold
[25:02] on to you can get happy in the flesh you
[25:05] can get all kind of feelings and
[25:06] emotions and that could be the devil but
[25:08] when God Burns that thing out of your
[25:10] soul and he comes and inhabits your soul
[25:13] you are
[25:14] changed for the rest of your life into
[25:16] eternity amen so that's what we want to
[25:18] do we want everybody if listen if
[25:20] Ephesus was a powerful Church everybody
[25:23] with me say Amen if e Ephesus was a
[25:26] powerful church it's only 12 but they
[25:28] were were 12 men that all had the Holy
[25:29] Ghost so now in the end time the Omega
[25:32] bride has to have a group of people I
[25:34] believe that's a powerful church and
[25:36] that includes sisters and
[25:38] brothers a powerful churches everybody
[25:41] with the Holy Ghost and all the problem
[25:44] no they may stay but well we won't have
[25:46] as many we'll know how to handle them
[25:47] all right I think that's what it was I
[25:50] don't think the early church just was
[25:51] they was on a you know bubble dance no
[25:53] they had their issues they had their
[25:55] problem they had their sons of ska they
[25:57] had their
[25:59] there Simon the the Tanner they had all
[26:01] these different ones that were you know
[26:03] they all were trying
[26:04] to combat the the early church and same
[26:07] we have the same here but listen we're
[26:09] Overcomers right through what through
[26:11] Christ that strengthens us all right so
[26:14] we just pray that uh uh we're praying
[26:16] for brother Aaron on Wednesday night and
[26:17] we appreciate these brothers uh doing
[26:19] the job that they do God's God's called
[26:21] us a good a gr group of people and I
[26:24] believe they're they're solid and we uh
[26:27] uh brother Dutch asked me last night he
[26:28] said I don't have nobody when I leave I
[26:30] have to call somebody in I said well you
[26:32] can't have none of mine I said he wanted
[26:35] him April the 14th and I said no I need
[26:37] to have him here on April the 14th but
[26:39] he's going to get somebody but it is
[26:41] pretty rough if you don't have a a
[26:43] minister brother Dale he he worked 8 to
[26:45] 10 hours a day led
[26:48] singing and preached every service they
[26:52] want to minister in here but colleag was
[26:54] one the first one really I think that
[26:55] that ministered a good bit that helped
[26:57] Dad out and uh we appreciate that cuz it
[27:00] really it's it's burdensome when you
[27:02] have to do it all by yourself you know
[27:04] and brother colie come in different ones
[27:06] um and helped out and we sure appreciate
[27:08] that brother colie L singing one time
[27:10] except for for a while didn't you buddy
[27:12] yep sure did you want to do it now okay
[27:16] he said I'll just do responsive reading

[28:08] strong we ask these in Jesus name
[28:12] amen Revelations one I was in the spirit
[28:15] on the Lord's day and heard behind me a
[28:16] great voice as of a trumpet saying I am
[28:18] Alpha and Omega the first and the last
[28:20] and what thou seest right in the book
[28:22] and send it into the seven churches
[28:23] which are in Asia Ephesus Smyrna we're
[28:25] getting ready to talk about Smyrna
[28:27] pergamus tharra Sardis Philadelphia Lea
[28:31] I turned to see the voice that spake to
[28:32] me and turning to see The Voice he saw
[28:35] seven golden candle sticks he saw
[28:36] something maybe he wasn't looking for
[28:38] but when he looked to see Jesus's voice
[28:40] he knew his voice he turned to look he
[28:41] saw a scene and that scene is the whole
[28:44] Gentile dispensation he saw every bit of
[28:47] it and that's me and you we're included
[28:49] in that we're included in this Vision I
[28:52] don't know if you know that or not we're
[28:53] included in this Vision you're standing
[28:55] in it today and the loudy in church J
[28:58] We're not in it we're we're not of it
[29:00] but we're in it and in the midst of the
[29:01] seven candlesticks one lik un to the son
[29:03] of man clothed with a garment down to
[29:04] the foot and G about to PS with a golden
[29:07] girdle he that had in his right hand
[29:10] Seven Stars and out of his mouth one a
[29:11] sharp two-edged sword that's the message
[29:14] now let's
[29:15] read and so the angel of the church in
[29:17] Smyrna write these things sayith the
[29:19] first and the last which are dead which
[29:21] was dead and is alive I Know Thy Works
[29:24] in Tribulation and poverty I look he
[29:26] didn't say I'll get you out of the
[29:29] right he did not say I'm going to spare
[29:32] you I'm going to get you out he says I
[29:34] Know Thy works I Know Thy tribulation I
[29:38] Know Thy poverty but Thou Art rich and I
[29:41] know the blasphemy of them which say
[29:43] they are Jews and are not but are the
[29:45] synagogues of Satan we know all Jews are
[29:48] not Jews right all Israel is not Israel
[29:51] fear none of those things which Thou
[29:52] shalt suffer behold the devil shall cast
[29:54] some of you into prison that you may be
[29:56] tried and you shall have tribulation in
[29:58] 10 days be thou faithful unto death and
[30:00] I will give thee a Crown of Life he that
[30:02] hath in near let him hear what the
[30:04] spirit saith unto the churches he that
[30:06] overcometh shall not be hurt praise God
[30:09] of the second death you may be seing the
[30:11] Lord as his Blessing to the reading of
[30:13] the word as we've been saying before I
[30:15] want you to understand this this this
[30:17] whole um excuse me this whole message
[30:20] that we're on of the seven Church ages
[30:23] is complete and final revelation of
[30:25] Jesus Christ to the Gentiles we get
[30:27] nothing else
[30:28] we don't get the 144,000 message that's
[30:30] right we get the message that's given in
[30:33] this age through the mouth of God are
[30:36] this as we say the announcement in
[30:38] heaven it came out of the mind of God
[30:39] and if you don't know what that word
[30:40] logos is that word logos is speech in
[30:44] other words God is Elohim God's not even
[30:46] God until he created
[30:49] angels hello God is an object of worship
[30:52] God is not even a name right all right
[30:56] to be a God you have to have something
[30:58] to worship you so God was not God until
[31:00] he created something to worship him then
[31:01] he became God but he didn't want to stay
[31:03] God he wanted to
[31:05] talk and in order for him to talk so
[31:07] that we little PE brains can understand
[31:09] it it was called as the scholar say the
[31:12] logos or the speech or the word of God
[31:14] is coming forth in other words he's
[31:16] saying something that you and I can
[31:18] understand that's right amen I mean how
[31:20] can this guy that and I say guy cuz he's
[31:22] a man how can this guy that knew
[31:24] everything from from way back before he
[31:27] even created the world he knew every Gat
[31:29] and how many triple billion zillion gats
[31:32] there would be in this
[31:34] earth and brother Brown even goes closer
[31:37] he says and how many times a little na
[31:38] bad at his eye he knew that how you
[31:41] going to understand that guy you can't
[31:44] you can't even understand
[31:45] eternity cuz you know what you're going
[31:47] to look at you watch in a few minutes
[31:48] and say he sure has been going a
[31:54] while but
[31:56] time is what we have to live in some of
[32:00] us preachers step off into eternity
[32:02] every once in a while and preach a few
[32:04] hours but that's okay you can sit and
[32:07] watch a ball game for a couple hours out
[32:08] of the mind of God comes a logos so in
[32:10] other words it don't stay in his mind
[32:11] because remember if he thought it but
[32:14] never said anything it's not going to
[32:16] come to pass same way with you you even
[32:19] us as finite beings listen even us as
[32:22] finite beings we have thoughts in our
[32:24] mind and like brother Gary's walking in
[32:26] the door now but he somebody gives him a
[32:28] plan to build a house well if he looks
[32:32] at that and says that's a good plan then
[32:33] he turns around goes back
[32:35] home never go to the job
[32:38] site well it's in his mind it's a good
[32:41] plan it look like a really good house
[32:44] right somebody really did a good job
[32:45] with these plans but until he goes and
[32:48] says hey I need 2500
[32:51] TOS
[32:53] logos I need this I'm instructing
[32:56] someone to bring me these things
[32:58] right then he goes I am the Builder I'm
[33:01] going to build this house according to
[33:03] these plans that's the way God is he
[33:06] built us come on and the solar system
[33:09] and everything we do he built it from
[33:11] his mind cuz he can't change he can't
[33:14] have a different thought like I said
[33:15] before don't ever say God don't love me
[33:18] no
[33:19] more if God ever loved you one time
[33:23] praise the go oh come on somebody if you
[33:25] just catch that if he ever loved you he
[33:28] can't un love you that's
[33:30] right he
[33:32] can't I don't even think he wants to he
[33:36] don't want to change his mind his mind's
[33:38] solid you know what so we can depend on
[33:40] our finite brain can Now understand a
[33:43] little piece of his infinite brain right
[33:45] that he's brought it down to me and you
[33:47] and this is the mind of God living out
[33:49] right here in front of everybody
[33:50] abely but it was sealed up at one time
[33:53] Paul's message was sealed up in God even
[33:56] when
[33:58] yeah all right I'm going to do it real
[34:00] quick so when God had this thought in
[34:02] the Old Testament now what did Brother R
[34:04] say he said that Moses he took Moses up
[34:07] into heaven right showed him the
[34:09] Tabernacle and how to build it but he
[34:12] showed him Jesus
[34:14] Christ which would be outter cour in
[34:16] cour holy of holy the pattern well Moses
[34:20] comes down what catches the mind of God
[34:21] comes down builds the Tabernacle but
[34:24] when he come over into the New Testament
[34:25] they said well God said sacrifice and
[34:29] offerings I would not I don't want no
[34:32] more of this it
[34:33] stinks you've made it a mockery but a
[34:36] body thou Hast prepared me now that
[34:39] Tabernacle that Moses saw that was a
[34:41] literal Tabernacle out of court inner
[34:44] Court holy of holies is now standing in
[34:46] front of you today you walked in with
[34:48] your Tabernacles whatever you got in
[34:50] your holy of holies it may be Unholy
[34:52] that's right but it can be holy right
[34:56] out of court you got Sun shine you got
[34:58] rain you got Gentiles coming in you got
[35:01] Gentiles going out you got animals being
[35:03] slain you got all this Blood and Guts
[35:06] everywhere but then you go back into the
[35:08] next
[35:10] compartment and you've got a
[35:12] Candlestick and You' got a little shoe
[35:14] bread but only a certain group can go
[35:16] back into
[35:17] there then then the high priest takes
[35:21] everything from there and goes into the
[35:22] holy of holies one man amen quietness
[35:26] when that curtain rocks could you
[35:29] imagine knowing that God's fixing to
[35:32] appear and you're the only one that's
[35:34] going to see him you have that in you
[35:36] right now right every day of your life
[35:39] if you're born again you have what
[35:41] Israel longed to see was they wanted to
[35:45] see that sh sure they could see the kind
[35:47] of they could see the cloud they could
[35:49] see the that the cloud dropped down into
[35:51] that holy of holies we got a picture of
[35:53] it back there where that cloud goes
[35:55] right down in the holy of holies they
[35:57] wanted to see who that was you are who
[36:00] that was what you got inside of you is
[36:03] the same thing that met Moses that met
[36:07] Aaron that met the different ones that
[36:08] went in the holy holies you possess that
[36:11] now that's why God wanted he didn't want
[36:13] that he wanted to prepare a body and
[36:15] he's prepared a body called a bride now
[36:18] but he stepped her through seven Church
[36:20] ages so the so that we can understand
[36:23] amen right like I said before you start
[36:26] studying irenius and I can see in just a
[36:29] very short period of time that I that I
[36:31] researched irenius what a great ministry
[36:34] he had what a what a separated Ministry
[36:36] he had well listen Paul was separated if
[36:40] Paul was separated irenius has got to be
[36:42] separated Martin's got to be separated
[36:44] Columbus got to be separated Luther's
[36:46] got to be separated West remember Luther
[36:47] was separated from the Catholic Church
[36:49] see brother R come out of Pentecost he
[36:51] didn't want nothing do with
[36:52] denominations he had to come out yeah so
[36:54] they're all separated so why me and you
[36:56] trying to stay in I don't mean I mean
[36:58] why do we try to go
[37:01] back the answer is not
[37:03] backwards the answer is
[37:06] [Music]
[37:07] forward that's why we were brother dut
[37:10] and I were talking last night and and I
[37:12] you see the deception of the devil
[37:14] because you take people's been in this
[37:16] message for 30 40 years preach the
[37:18] message preach the
[37:19] message and they walk away that's still
[37:23] got to be going through their mind but
[37:25] somewhere Satan has got that thing so
[37:27] callous until they don't even think
[37:29] about it anymore how in the world could
[37:31] you come from out from under the sh
[37:34] glory and go back into the
[37:37] filth you never got the sh of Glory in
[37:40] the first place is what it was so you
[37:42] make sure you got the Shak of Glory
[37:43] because remember the Bible says even the
[37:46] elect could be deceived but brother
[37:49] brandom thank God for a prophet he said
[37:51] no she will not that's right she will
[37:54] not be deceived why cuz she's got the
[37:56] one listen you'll be deceived if you got
[37:59] the deceiver inside you but if you got
[38:01] the revealer inside of you the deceiver
[38:04] is not there that's right so there's the
[38:06] one you hold on to that's that Anchor
[38:08] Holds and that's the The Bu land that
[38:10] we've been singing We Sing about all
[38:12] these things like that but when you
[38:13] start singing bu land it's like brother
[38:15] um Michael said he said don't you want
[38:17] to go there why you want to stay here I
[38:21] want to go there I want that to come
[38:25] here thank you listen this is
[38:29] truth this is truth there is no other
[38:32] truth in the world there's part
[38:35] truth Baptists have part truth B
[38:38] everybody's got part truth and like I
[38:39] said before God don't just talk to the
[38:41] bride he talks to a lot of people okay
[38:44] and and he anoints and inspires
[38:47] people but there's only one bride right
[38:51] one she don't have he don't have two
[38:54] wives he divorced Israel for what she
[38:56] did and he married a bride and he's not
[38:59] going to divorce us because that's why
[39:01] he divorced her because she went whing
[39:03] and we're not going to we're the Bride
[39:05] of Jesus Christ The Virtuous sinless
[39:08] bride of Jesus Christ you said oh I sin
[39:10] every day yes you do but God through
[39:12] that filter of grace and mercy can't see
[39:18] it he hears your voice God I didn't mean
[39:22] to do that amen God I didn't mean to do
[39:25] that I am so sorry and he know where
[39:28] whether you're sorry or not cuz there's
[39:30] a difference in getting being sorry cuz
[39:32] you got caught come on somebody and
[39:35] being really sorrowful Godly sorrow the
[39:38] Bible says leads what leads to
[39:40] repentance Godly sorrow leads to
[39:42] repentance all right I don't know why I
[39:43] got on that but that won't charge I
[39:45] won't charge anything for that so a
[39:46] mystery is unfolded in other words it
[39:48] comes out of the mind of God the reason
[39:49] I'm going over this this is so
[39:52] miraculous God did
[39:55] this God did it not not not somebody
[39:59] that that might be true not somebody
[40:02] that might have it
[40:04] right this guy was right from the
[40:06] beginning yes sir and he's trying to
[40:08] give us a piece at a time cuz we can't
[40:10] take it all at one time we go crazy so
[40:14] he gives it to us first church age then
[40:16] he gives to Second Church age and then
[40:18] here we are though in Lea where much is
[40:21] given much is
[40:23] required we're required to see all that
[40:26] to be be able to see how God moves up to
[40:30] your day right here and we'll read it in
[40:33] just a few minutes what brother R says
[40:34] he brother R even says the evil that was
[40:36] in the first church age lapped itself
[40:39] over in every Church age and came right
[40:41] down to this age right here so we didn't
[40:44] leave the
[40:46] evil we didn't leave it down in that
[40:48] first church age no if it was in the
[40:49] first church age it's going to be in
[40:50] this one Grievous wolves Grievous wolves
[40:53] falling away from the Faith Falling Away
[40:55] from the faith same thing
[40:58] so a mystery is unfolded to the star of
[41:00] the age which is one
[41:02] messenger One messenger to each age not
[41:05] four five not 15 or 20 that's right one
[41:08] and that piece matches exactly what God
[41:10] saw and when it did boom then there you
[41:12] have eternity the logos Paul was not
[41:16] Paul was so much a prisoner he said I'm
[41:19] not of my own self I need I got to have
[41:21] the mind of Christ right he tells you
[41:24] you got to have the mind of Christ amen
[41:26] and the way it's called heresy do I
[41:29] serve this
[41:30] God
[41:33] crazy every once in a while it's not bad
[41:36] to go crazy stay that way might have a
[41:39] problem but it doesn't hurt but every
[41:42] once in a while get a little crazy and
[41:44] that's all right if you want to run the
[41:45] aisle go ahead if you want to shout if
[41:47] you want to praise the Lord you'll go
[41:48] right
[41:50] ahead as long as of God it'll get you
[41:53] somewhere like that old guy said that
[41:55] the guy was running the aisles and he
[41:57] run over the you know he was in
[41:58] Pentecost and he was running through the
[42:00] he run over the bench and fell and broke
[42:02] his leg and he said he did it for the
[42:04] glory of God and that old man said God
[42:06] wasn't in that or you wouldn't have
[42:06] broke your
[42:08] leg okie dokie
[42:10] then thank God for people that can tell
[42:13] the truth so a trumpet sound so a
[42:15] message is brought Paul brings a message
[42:16] we going look see irenius is fixing to
[42:18] bring a message but it's look it's a
[42:20] distinct and declared message is for
[42:22] that age this age and all the other ages
[42:25] so it starts a spiritual war the true
[42:27] word versus the false Doctrine cuz false
[42:30] Doctrine
[42:32] listen who was true
[42:35] first God then Satan comes in and
[42:38] perverts always Satan is not an
[42:41] originator of
[42:43] anything except sin I got it but he
[42:47] takes what God he takes the true and
[42:49] makes false out of it so the true word
[42:52] had to strike the Earth and then the
[42:54] false word come right behind it all
[42:56] right everybody with me
[42:57] so that's going to be all the way
[42:59] through all even in this age amen
[43:01] remember brother Ram come out and he had
[43:03] he had the signs and the Wonders and
[43:05] then they started doing the oil in the
[43:06] hands and doing and they were hitting
[43:08] and missing every once in a while that
[43:10] wasn't a God that was an imitation we
[43:13] don't want imitation we want the truth
[43:16] right so then the messengers is laid
[43:17] away or taken off the Earth as we were
[43:20] um talking about the other day he didn't
[43:23] let Paul continue on he didn't let
[43:25] brother random continue on cuzz
[43:26] everybody looking at the messenger
[43:28] looking at the messenger looking at the
[43:30] messenger you better be looking at Jesus
[43:33] Christ your
[43:35] messenger that's right now he uses a
[43:37] voice he uses a distinct person to bring
[43:40] that message but it's God if it's logos
[43:43] then it's got to be logos now all right
[43:47] so look people will accept it or reject
[43:49] it as we were talking about free will
[43:50] this morning it brings a temporary
[43:52] judgment or a plague what the ones that
[43:54] turn it down get a plague the ones that
[43:56] receive it we get a blessing he that
[44:00] overcometh you know they had one thing
[44:02] to overcome you know we in this age we
[44:04] have all
[44:05] those things to
[44:07] overcome but listen God equipped us to
[44:11] do it that's right amen he knew we'd be
[44:14] here there's listen there is no time God
[44:16] said oops I didn't mean to do
[44:19] that everything he has is a purpose for
[44:23] you and me not for
[44:24] him he's Eternal he need me he don't
[44:29] need air to breathe he don't need an
[44:30] earth to stand
[44:32] on but he wants you cuz you were in his
[44:36] mind you were very part of him and he
[44:38] wants to express you in this time of the
[44:42] darkest most evil time that ever was is
[44:45] right here today amen and you're sitting
[44:47] in it and tomorrow you're going to go
[44:49] into Monday which is the devil day
[44:50] anyway especially at the post office I
[44:53] don't know about y'all but
[44:56] uh God's still there amen God's still
[44:59] working he don't he don't take vacations
[45:01] praise
[45:02] God so the next stage comes there's
[45:05] another announcement then out of the
[45:06] mind of God comes the second part or a
[45:08] sealed up message comes and and irenius
[45:11] is I I'm sure listen that's what
[45:13] surprises me because Paul I don't think
[45:16] Paul ever sit in his study one day or
[45:19] prison he spent a lot of time in
[45:22] jail Paul Paul spent a lot of time in
[45:24] jail he was a prisoner but he was a
[45:27] prisoner to Christ he wasn't a prisoner
[45:29] to to them cuz they let him go wherever
[45:31] he wanted to but I don't think Paul sat
[45:32] there and was writing and and he was
[45:34] writing to the Corinthians and different
[45:36] ones and I don't think at that point in
[45:38] time he
[45:39] said I'm writing the
[45:42] Bible no he was writing to the
[45:45] Corinthians because they were doing some
[45:46] bad
[45:47] stuff he was writing to the
[45:49] Thessalonians he was writing to Timothy
[45:50] telling him some things he needed to do
[45:52] but it developed into it was the whole
[45:55] time it was God working and
[45:58] Paul why am I saying this cuz whatever
[46:00] happened then is got to happen
[46:03] now I don't think Paul ever said now now
[46:05] I think I'm the first church CH
[46:07] messenger he probably didn't even know
[46:08] nothing about see remember he died
[46:12] before John went to patmas and had this
[46:16] Vision now God may have revealed stuff
[46:18] to Paul different things but I don't
[46:20] think he said well now I'm Church agent
[46:22] number one and irenius is coming that
[46:24] was left to me and you and the end time
[46:28] that was left that the book will be open
[46:31] yes they would be able to see from cover
[46:32] to cover there you go Paul said I look
[46:35] to a glass
[46:37] Darkly he could see something coming but
[46:40] he just didn't know what it
[46:41] was but we praise God that he's give us
[46:44] time in the end time time in the end
[46:47] time to pick these things up and say man
[46:50] there was Paul the Great Mighty Paul
[46:51] wrote 80% of the Bible they actually
[46:53] call it a Paul Indian Bible in different
[46:54] places so he wrote 80% of the the New
[46:57] Testament not the Old Testament but New
[46:59] Testament and then here we got irenius
[47:01] and we see in a few minutes his powerful
[47:04] powerful message that irus uh brought
[47:07] and he still held on to one God and he
[47:09] still had on to held on to water baptism
[47:11] the name of Jesus Christ because he was
[47:13] under that lion age of the combat Beast
[47:16] the lion ox man and Eagle the lion age
[47:19] was the first three Church ages one two
[47:20] and three so we're in the second Church
[47:22] age but they were
[47:24] bold where have we lost our
[47:27] boldness we have lost
[47:31] it that don't mean to be arrogant
[47:33] there's a difference in arrogant and
[47:35] bold am
[47:38] okay so remember that everything started
[47:40] with the age of Pentecost we'll look at
[47:42] it in just a minute on the chart the
[47:44] messenger was the Holy Ghost then the
[47:46] alpha age started or the Ephesian Church
[47:48] age started about ad 53 and then Paul
[47:52] died around 64 to 67 ad they don't know
[47:55] exactly what year they didn't keep
[47:57] really good records back then from 64 to
[48:00] 67 he was killed because that's the time
[48:02] that Nero was was on U Throne whatever
[48:05] he was there in Rome so the Ephesian
[48:07] Church age though ended around ad 170 so
[48:11] Paul left the scene in 64 65 66 and then
[48:14] it went on another what 150 years
[48:17] almost or 50 years
[48:20] almost well more than
[48:22] that that somebody had to pick that
[48:24] message up and sweep it to
[48:29] irenius but what happened was the
[48:32] original messenger was gone only a
[48:35] certain group of people picked that up
[48:37] and carried it what happened was the
[48:38] Grievous wolves took it in this
[48:40] direction the false teaching took it in
[48:43] this direction cuz we're going to see
[48:44] here as we go through the church ages
[48:47] that was 170 ad well now 325 ad is when
[48:50] they had the U um Nan Council there in N
[48:54] Rome and that's when everything started
[48:56] turning into into into just mush they
[48:58] took everything out of the Bible and put
[49:00] it on a pope all right but we'll see
[49:02] that in just a little bit so the
[49:03] Ephesian Church AG ended around
[49:05] 8170 but what happened is is we're going
[49:08] to see this chart and I'm going to read
[49:10] you the Bible
[49:13] um if you look at that chart you see
[49:15] Pentecost this is all your seven Church
[49:18] ages there's your stars Paul irus Martin
[49:21] Columba Luther Wesley and then you got
[49:23] the Holy Ghost like it was over here and
[49:24] then you got the Elijah of the end time
[49:27] which carries us over into
[49:29] eternity all right we'll explain that in
[49:31] just a little bit maybe not today but
[49:33] you got Paul you see that blue over
[49:36] there it says Paul I don't know if you
[49:37] can see it in the very back but it says
[49:39] Porters what happened now on in
[49:41] Pentecost Paul was not the spokesman of
[49:43] Pentecost the Holy Ghost was the
[49:45] spokesman of
[49:48] Pentecost all right but then Paul comes
[49:50] along in ad 53 and establish a church in
[49:53] Ephesus starts bringing his message so
[49:56] brother R makes an outstanding statement
[49:58] we're reading here in just a few minutes
[49:59] he said each messenger comes at the end
[50:01] of the age well now look if Paul listen
[50:04] if this was the first age everybody with
[50:07] me this is the first age if Paul came at
[50:10] the end of the first age he'd have come
[50:13] right here and he' have missed his whole
[50:15] everybody over
[50:18] here but Paul came at the end of
[50:22] Pentecost of ad30 to ad 53 or 56
[50:27] Paul brings his message and he brings a
[50:30] message
[50:31] dies the message carries on but then it
[50:34] starts going down but there's an overlap
[50:37] here or an open door where it laps over
[50:39] literally these things right here should
[50:42] be everybody seen the uh what is it the
[50:45] Olympic rings how they're all connected
[50:48] these should all be connected right
[50:50] because they don't abruptly end and
[50:51] another one began everybody with me this
[50:54] is chart was made where you can see it's
[50:56] Church individually but this church age
[50:58] lapped over in this overlap where a
[51:01] porter comes in that we were talking
[51:03] about this morning we'll read the
[51:04] scripture there in uh I believe it was
[51:06] in
[51:07] John but then Paul comes at the end of
[51:10] the Pentecostal age brings his message
[51:13] then irenius comes at the end of the age
[51:16] he doesn't come at the end of his age he
[51:17] comes at the end of Paul's age which is
[51:20] Ephesus he comes in and brings the
[51:23] message to Smyrna so now let's I'll pull
[51:26] it up on this screen you don't have to
[51:28] you don't have to go to
[51:29] it brother Rob said look now each Church
[51:32] age had its messenger we know that Paul
[51:34] was a first messenger and when the first
[51:36] trumpet sounded the first seal tore
[51:38] loose Paul was the first Messenger as we
[51:40] found what did he do declared a war on
[51:43] the Orthodox Church for not believing
[51:46] the Messiah sign that Jesus had produced
[51:49] to them while they should have known it
[51:51] they should have known him remember Paul
[51:53] come at the End of the Age so what age
[51:56] did he come at the end of end of
[51:58] Pentecost all right from 8030 to 8050
[52:01] something he comes at the end of that
[52:03] age that Pentecostal age all the
[52:05] messengers come at the end of the age
[52:07] it's at the end time when these things
[52:10] are brought forth so the end time is
[52:11] when it ends it all up all right
[52:13] everybody with me let's go to John
[52:16] 10 let's read about this Porter ver
[52:20] verely I say unto you he that entereth
[52:22] not by the door now who is the door the
[52:25] door is Jesus Christ it's not another
[52:27] man that's right it's Jesus Christ I am
[52:30] the door he said I am the way the truth
[52:33] and the life yes so the Porter is not
[52:37] the door the Porter is the introducer to
[52:41] the door everybody with me but he's got
[52:44] to have the mind of what the door is and
[52:46] what's behind it for him to be a
[52:49] porter
[52:50] right in other words pick up the mind of
[52:53] God the logos and tell you what's in
[52:55] there in that as we were talking the
[52:57] rich Caron or wherever you want to go to
[52:59] a
[53:00] motel but if you don't come in by the
[53:03] door if you climb in some other way
[53:05] you're a thief and a robber but he that
[53:08] entereth in by the door is The Shepherd
[53:11] of the sheep now
[53:12] entereth entereth in by the door is The
[53:15] Shepherd of the sheep you got to realize
[53:18] one thing sheep need a shepherd and as a
[53:21] Shepherd being the pastor of the church
[53:22] you're the shepherd but listen we got a
[53:23] chief
[53:25] Shepherd amen we got a Shepherd that we
[53:27] all got to look to and which is the door
[53:30] Jesus Christ if we keep him the center
[53:32] of everything we are
[53:34] good do not ever put something in front
[53:37] of him that's right so if you'll keep it
[53:40] that way and keep your line up then
[53:41] everything's fine that's why people
[53:43] couldn't keep it they couldn't see
[53:45] brother brandom as a porter they saw him
[53:47] as a
[53:48] door hello they saw him as
[53:51] God he's not
[53:55] God he's a porter to introduce you to
[53:58] the
[54:00] door but he that ENT by the door is The
[54:02] Shepherd of the sheep to him the porter
[54:04] openeth all right look to him in other
[54:06] words who's coming in the porter openeth
[54:08] so there's an open door between each age
[54:11] and we'll look at it in just a second
[54:13] and look and the sheep hear his
[54:18] voice now
[54:20] remember I like what brother Brown
[54:23] says about a pastor you know a pastor
[54:25] lives with his people
[54:27] people and being
[54:30] beekeepers um we were talking about last
[54:33] night you can put 10 hives across that
[54:35] wall right
[54:36] there and you can put 10 different sets
[54:39] of of bee colonies and 10 different
[54:42] queens and this one right here won't fly
[54:44] into that one if he's supposed to be or
[54:46] she's supposed to be in this one why
[54:48] there's an odor their Queen gives off an
[54:51] odor different from the next one they go
[54:53] by smell sheep go by smell they don't
[54:56] know their Shepherd by name they're not
[54:58] humans
[55:01] right so you got to smell the same as
[55:03] your
[55:07] sheep I don't know where that came
[55:10] from cuz if you don't smell like if you
[55:13] don't smell like a sheep what's the
[55:14] Sheep going to do that ain't my shepherd
[55:17] right so you go by smell and literally
[55:20] we have had 10 hives and and there's no
[55:23] they call it drifting a little bit but
[55:24] 99% of those bees if she comes from this
[55:26] direction she's supposed to be over
[55:28] there she'll fly straight over there
[55:30] them other bees are going to go to their
[55:31] High because of the odor that the queen
[55:33] gives off this different or pheromone
[55:35] that she gives off that's different than
[55:36] the rest of them so same way with the
[55:38] Sheep the shepherd lives so much with
[55:40] the Sheep he smoks like the
[55:46] Sheep we'll stop on that right there to
[55:50] him to him the Porter openeth and the
[55:53] sheep hear his voice and he C look he
[55:56] calleth his own Sheep by name all right
[56:00] and leadth them
[56:02] out and when he put forth his own sheep
[56:06] he goes before
[56:08] them and the Sheep follow for they know
[56:11] his
[56:12] voice and a stranger will they not
[56:15] follow but will flee from him for they
[56:18] know not the voice of
[56:21] strangers wow my sheep hear my voice
[56:26] amen now the Greek lexican tells us that
[56:30] that word Porter which is Thor Roose
[56:35] which is
[56:36] through it's also a watcher or one that
[56:40] keeps the door he's not the door he's
[56:42] The Keeper of the
[56:44] door everybody with me he's not the door
[56:48] he's The Keeper of the door but he knows
[56:50] what's behind the door God has give him
[56:52] the uh um give him the mind to know
[56:55] what's behind that door
[56:57] all right if you take a porter that's
[56:58] never been in a rich Colton and you put
[57:00] him in front of the rich Colton he's a
[57:01] porter but he don't know what's behind
[57:04] that door CU he had listen to that part
[57:07] of what the shepherd to know what's
[57:10] behind it so you got to be at the right
[57:11] place at the right time all right put
[57:13] the right Porter in the right place and
[57:15] he'll tell you about the door so let's
[57:17] look right here and see
[57:19] again that
[57:21] Paul comes at the end of the age of
[57:24] Pentecost which there's a lap over time
[57:27] then when Paul is finished and his
[57:29] message is starting to dwindle brother
[57:31] Brown says his message starts to in
[57:33] other words what there's divisions
[57:36] factions everything starts listen the
[57:38] only person that likes to divide and
[57:39] conquer is who the devil all right God
[57:43] doesn't stick together so that Porter
[57:47] comes then at the end
[57:50] of the Ephesus or Ephesian Church age
[57:54] irenius comes on the scene at that
[57:56] period of time and he brings a
[57:59] message all right but there's also some
[58:01] lap over between Paul and irenius and
[58:04] I'll show you here in just a minute that
[58:06] lap over as we were talking this morning
[58:08] to me that equals grace of God to not
[58:11] just say abruptly all right you've heard
[58:13] brother brand I see you can't hear him
[58:15] no more you either take it leave it or
[58:16] done no there's a lap over time a lot of
[58:19] those Pentecostals were still
[58:21] Pentecostals when brother ROM was
[58:23] preaching amen they were still
[58:25] Pentecostal
[58:26] after he got finished
[58:28] preaching but there was praise God there
[58:31] was somebody heard the right voice they
[58:34] heard the right voice and they said oh
[58:36] he's not the door but he's the one
[58:38] that's going to introduce us to the
[58:40] door we're going into the right place at
[58:42] the right time amen that's right only
[58:46] the hand of God can do that how'd he
[58:48] call you how'd you get
[58:50] here some of you have heard other
[58:55] voices some of you may be hearing voices
[59:00] now and I'm not talking about the
[59:03] ministry here I'm talking about the
[59:04] message of the hour yes when God called
[59:07] a group of people you had to respond
[59:09] that's right if there was nothing in you
[59:11] to
[59:12] respond you ain't going to
[59:15] respond and we know one thing for sure
[59:17] there was nothing in us that was eternal
[59:20] it was the thoughts of God that come
[59:22] looking for me and you amen knowing we
[59:24] would accept it and when we did would
[59:26] give us a new yes
[59:29] birth the seeds the word of God you had
[59:32] to hear the word of
[59:36] God not only hear it you had to accept
[59:39] it that's right abely I heard the word
[59:41] of God for 20 years every once in a
[59:44] while right we come on Christmas and
[59:47] Easter Mother's Day every once in a
[59:49] while and I heard a preaching but it
[59:52] went but there was one time when it was
[59:54] my time he called and I answer same way
[59:57] with you there's a time God called and
[59:59] you
[1:00:00] answer and you heard that Porter tell
[1:00:03] you here's the door come here's the way
[1:00:08] and what's behind that is what Holiness
[1:00:11] yes sanctification what's behind that is
[1:00:15] a clean living yes what's behind that is
[1:00:17] no letter to get in the
[1:00:20] church what behind that door is how to
[1:00:22] get baptized how to live right how to
[1:00:25] talk
[1:00:26] how to go to church how to do the things
[1:00:28] of God inside of there not outside here
[1:00:31] not in the outer Court sir people going
[1:00:34] up down the street never even pay
[1:00:36] attention to that building but somehow
[1:00:38] you got to that building and you
[1:00:40] said yes amen okay tell me what this
[1:00:44] building's
[1:00:45] about I see this door This Man Called

[1:01:20] on but we went to these different motels
[1:01:24] we went to these different places but
[1:01:27] there was one time we go walking down
[1:01:28] the road and something goes
[1:01:36] stopah he said stop and you
[1:01:39] stop millions of others just walked
[1:01:42] right on by and he may have said stop

[1:02:42] people go up and down the road of life

[1:02:48] door the door's here that door is Jesus
[1:02:51] Christ they stand right here and this
[1:02:54] man is compelling them remember the the
[1:02:55] Bible says go into the highways and
[1:02:57] compel them to come in in other words
[1:03:00] now the Porter's out in the middle of
[1:03:01] the
[1:03:02] road he's saying come in I don't care
[1:03:06] come in come as you are but you're not
[1:03:08] going to leave as you
[1:03:10] are if you really get something
[1:03:13] everybody all right I really didn't mean
[1:03:15] to use the motel but that's really what
[1:03:17] it is I mean the porter stands at the
[1:03:20] door right and you've seen I've seen
[1:03:22] them in the movies you've seen them they
[1:03:23] stand there with a really nice coat and
[1:03:25] they they're
[1:03:27] presentable so anybody can walk up to
[1:03:30] them that wants to but do you really
[1:03:33] want to know oh I heard about that I
[1:03:34] heard about that that religion them cult
[1:03:37] people them cult people they follow a
[1:03:39] man everybody follows a
[1:03:45] man my God Jim Jones got 500 people to
[1:03:48] kill
[1:03:49] herself don't drink the
[1:03:52] Kool-Aid but can you imagine he duped
[1:03:56] 500 people into commit
[1:03:59] murder
[1:04:02] willfully why can't we get God to lead
[1:04:04] us into the
[1:04:07] truth if he can lead that group of
[1:04:09] people into killing theirself because of
[1:04:13] religion listen it he was a religious
[1:04:15] man he was in brother R's meetings
[1:04:16] you'all know that Jim Jones was in
[1:04:18] brother R's meetings yes he was he sure
[1:04:21] was but you see what he done he took his
[1:04:23] own twist and took the people off and
[1:04:26] they all died that's right but how many
[1:04:29] people spiritually died since they
[1:04:31] turned the message down it wouldn't go
[1:04:32] through that door cuz you know what that
[1:04:34] door is not so illustrious it's not so
[1:04:38] beautiful the Bible said there's no
[1:04:39] beauty that we should desire him he's
[1:04:42] standing there little short guy he's got
[1:04:45] a crown of thorns on his
[1:04:49] head
[1:04:51] brother but he's the most beautiful
[1:04:53] thing you'll ever see in your life if
[1:04:54] you become a Christian
[1:04:56] amen that's the most beautiful thing
[1:04:58] you'll ever see in your entire life if
[1:05:01] you look at those nail scar hands and
[1:05:04] know he did it for you but you had to
[1:05:07] have somebody tell you about
[1:05:09] him I didn't do it that way God set it
[1:05:13] up that way God set it up that you would
[1:05:15] hear seven Church age
[1:05:18] Messengers the people of those ages
[1:05:21] depended on irenius to bring them a
[1:05:24] message
[1:05:26] the people of Martin when irenius passed
[1:05:29] on we'll look at in a minute irenius
[1:05:31] actually passed on the same time about
[1:05:33] in the middle of the
[1:05:35] age we'll see up when we get to Columba
[1:05:38] he died before the age even
[1:05:40] started but his message amen it's the
[1:05:44] message that carries this thing on not
[1:05:46] the person amen it's the message the
[1:05:49] voice it's looking at looking sometimes
[1:05:53] you got to look past the
[1:05:54] porter
[1:05:56] he may be not the best looking thing in
[1:05:57] the
[1:05:59] world but he's your
[1:06:01] Porter he's your introducer to what's
[1:06:04] behind the door and that's what these

[1:07:52] real quick everybody okay all right it's
[1:07:54] hot up here
[1:07:56] the Philadelphian Church age 1960
[1:07:58] brother R said look now there's one of
[1:08:00] the Striking things though keep bearing
[1:08:02] in your mind that these Church ages
[1:08:04] start and whatever is in that one Church
[1:08:08] age it goes all the way through every
[1:08:11] Church age and each one of the church
[1:08:13] ages lap over one another now if you
[1:08:16] don't know what a lap over is Brother
[1:08:17] Gary does because you build
[1:08:19] stairs all right stairs are not hung out
[1:08:22] in the middle of space you started a
[1:08:24] base right you put a board up you lap
[1:08:28] over this board then from the on this
[1:08:31] board you lap another board you don't
[1:08:33] put it on the side you put it right on
[1:08:34] top of it right brother Gary put it
[1:08:36] right on top of it pretty much CU what
[1:08:39] it supports itself there's a support
[1:08:42] going all the way up and that's what
[1:08:44] this is this is a lap over you've lapped
[1:08:47] over the stairs so that you can get to
[1:08:49] another church age brother I'm going
[1:08:50] explain it in a minute and each of the
[1:08:53] church ages laps over another if you
[1:08:54] study the history Clos close with the
[1:08:56] book you'll find out it's like laps like
[1:08:58] this laying over each other and one
[1:09:01] Church age is going out the angel that
[1:09:03] comes in between
[1:09:05] there right well get back to
[1:09:10] my now what the Angel's going to do I'm
[1:09:12] going to read the quote but I'll I'll
[1:09:13] ver not verba him but what happens is
[1:09:16] this messenger picks up the mind of God
[1:09:19] the logos of God but what does he do he
[1:09:22] rebukes these back here from falling
[1:09:24] away
[1:09:25] he understands that there's something
[1:09:28] going on that the people are getting
[1:09:31] cold and Irene says they're getting cold
[1:09:35] I'm going to begin to proclaim a message
[1:09:39] that brings them out of that in the
[1:09:40] overlap and then brings this group of
[1:09:42] people in listen it must be perfect cuz
[1:09:46] God God's W done that we didn't all
[1:09:48] right amen so now one Church age's going
[1:09:53] out the angel comes in between there
[1:09:54] it's to call back that church to Faith
[1:09:57] that it once lost it's always been that
[1:10:01] and I didn't realize this I'm I'm pretty
[1:10:03] smart guy but I didn't realize this
[1:10:04] right here took a prophet did you know
[1:10:07] where the book of Jude is placed in the
[1:10:08] right place in the Bible watch what
[1:10:11] brother Brown says look at Jude the last
[1:10:14] book in the Bible in other words before
[1:10:16] Revelation till you hit the Revelation
[1:10:18] there Jude Jude said I write unto you
[1:10:21] wrote unto you that you might earnestly
[1:10:22] contend for the faith that was once
[1:10:24] delivered to the Saints the lapping over
[1:10:27] between the
[1:10:29] apostles H
[1:10:32] Corinthians Hebrews Timothy all those
[1:10:36] right Jude comes on the scene and writes
[1:10:39] a lap over to lap lap us into the Book
[1:10:42] of Revelations thank God for a
[1:10:44] prophet and he's telling them declaring
[1:10:47] them to earnestly contend for the faith
[1:10:49] that was once delivered to the Saints in
[1:10:50] other words back here now watch what
[1:10:51] brother Brown said the lapping over
[1:10:53] between the apostles and the coming of
[1:10:56] the Revelation because most of the
[1:10:57] apostles were
[1:11:00] dead see they were gone on there was
[1:11:02] only one living and that's John and he's
[1:11:03] going to be the porter or the one that's
[1:11:05] going to bring us into the Book of
[1:11:06] Revelations he's the one that Jesus was
[1:11:09] talking about he said some of you won't
[1:11:11] die until you see my coming where did he
[1:11:14] see his coming at chapter
[1:11:17] one I turned and looked and saw seven oh
[1:11:20] Hallelujah seven golden candlesticks and
[1:11:22] there's a bride and John's like waa that
[1:11:25] that's what he
[1:11:26] meant that's what he meant he's coming
[1:11:29] back in the bride cuz there one thing
[1:11:31] for sure John had the Holy
[1:11:33] Ghost and the Holy Ghost wrote the word
[1:11:36] had to correspond with the Holy Ghost
[1:11:38] that was in John and that's why John in
[1:11:40] Revelations 5 screamed out and everybody
[1:11:42] heard him we ought to try that
[1:11:45] sometime when you see your name on the
[1:11:47] book you ought to start screaming and
[1:11:48] Shout cuz there's a lot of people don't
[1:11:49] have their name on a book oh they have
[1:11:51] it on a book book of life but I'm
[1:11:54] looking at the Lamb's Book of Life The
[1:11:57] Eternal section the part that God put
[1:12:00] totally
[1:12:01] aside no one can touch it that's right
[1:12:04] cuz remember in the other parts you can
[1:12:07] have your name
[1:12:08] erased cuz Judas was in The Book of Life
[1:12:13] he was in the Lamb's Book of Life but
[1:12:14] not the Eternal station brother R said
[1:12:16] his name was marked out he was given a
[1:12:19] chance in other words he was G there's
[1:12:21] not a great big book up there come on
[1:12:22] people when we go to the white Throne
[1:12:24] judgment there not going to be dust go
[1:12:29] everywhere it ain't going to be James
[1:12:31] klie cuz he ain't going to be there he's
[1:12:33] going to be standing back here but so
[1:12:37] and so and so and so no ain't going to
[1:12:38] be
[1:12:39] that where is your book written
[1:12:43] today right here in your
[1:12:46] actions that's what the old phrase say
[1:12:48] sister tell me I can read you like
[1:12:51] a is she a book am I a book no I'm not
[1:12:55] book but I am the book I'm the book it's
[1:12:58] written the Bible says written Epistles
[1:13:01] known and read of all men so Hallelujah
[1:13:04] you're looking at the book and I'm
[1:13:05] looking at the book and if you got
[1:13:07] eternal life today I'm looking at the
[1:13:08] Eternal section never can be taken
[1:13:12] out you'll never sin enough to be taken
[1:13:16] out cuz you know what if your name's in
[1:13:17] there like that you won't sin like
[1:13:19] that pretty
[1:13:21] simple the lapping over between the
[1:13:24] apostles and the coming of the
[1:13:25] Revelation because most apostles were
[1:13:28] dead then see was gone on one living at
[1:13:30] that time that was St John the Divine
[1:13:32] which is the Revelator or writer that
[1:13:34] got the Revelation from the angel of the
[1:13:36] Lord to write the Book of Revelations
[1:13:37] remember he didn't get it from an
[1:13:41] angel he got it from Jesus Christ the
[1:13:43] angel if you read your Bible look at the
[1:13:45] Book of Revelations there's a lot of red
[1:13:47] letters in there that usually
[1:13:49] constitutes that Jesus is
[1:13:53] talking thank now you see they laap over
[1:13:55] one another so now I guess you've
[1:13:57] noticed that and picked it up coming
[1:13:59] down as I've been mentioning it how that
[1:14:01] here in the Sardis age he's talking
[1:14:03] about the Sardis age that was the
[1:14:04] marriage age actually the church never
[1:14:06] really come into full existence until
[1:14:07] thyra but he got married in Sardis
[1:14:10] Sardis means being a marriage now we'll
[1:14:11] read this later on cuz I I'll explain
[1:14:13] what he just said there is an
[1:14:15] explanation for that the church Ain
[1:14:17] started in Ephesus but I know what he's
[1:14:18] talking about and I'll break it down for
[1:14:20] you when we get to the sardian church
[1:14:22] age now if you notice it married here
[1:14:24] and then lapped over into that age there
[1:14:26] and you notice Luther last night come
[1:14:27] out with a dead name a name of dead and
[1:14:30] then Escape one see it had the dead
[1:14:32] Church from back here the escaping of
[1:14:34] the little Remnant that was brought out
[1:14:36] in this age here we'll get to that later
[1:14:39] then tomorrow night when it goes out
[1:14:40] just at the end now watch notice the
[1:14:42] angel appears right at the end time just
[1:14:46] at the end time to rebuke the church now
[1:14:49] who did Brother brandham
[1:14:51] rebuke the
[1:14:53] Pentecostals more than any body he
[1:14:55] rebuked them for falling away from their
[1:14:57] first
[1:14:59] love he really didn't do much I mean he
[1:15:01] called out Baptist in different once but
[1:15:03] he was in that Pentecostal rank he said
[1:15:05] you
[1:15:06] Pentecostals he said you you shouted it
[1:15:13] out he said you stopped God's moved
[1:15:17] on could you imagine being a staunch
[1:15:20] Pentecostal that's why they didn't want
[1:15:21] to hear him later
[1:15:23] on right right yeah the angel appears
[1:15:26] right at the end time just at the end
[1:15:28] time to rebuke the church for it losing
[1:15:30] its first love and how it got away from
[1:15:32] God like they did down through there the
[1:15:35] ages same time the messenger thing same
[1:15:38] thing the messenger does tonight the
[1:15:39] angel messenger comes back to rebuke
[1:15:41] them each age like that for what they
[1:15:43] had done so that makes a lap over in one
[1:15:46] in each of the church ages just lap
[1:15:50] right over one another like that like
[1:15:52] climbing up a step it's laying in laps
[1:15:55] like that in other words like this all
[1:15:57] right L say in church
[1:15:59] age Paul comes at the end of the age and
[1:16:02] on down End of the Age the lap over the
[1:16:04] lap part that's when the angel comes
[1:16:06] that's when the messenger comes at the
[1:16:07] end of the age and the lap over as we
[1:16:09] were showing in the chart end of the age
[1:16:12] that what M that's what makes it lap see
[1:16:14] to the angel speaking what was this laps
[1:16:18] over here to the angel at the end of
[1:16:20] that age see picking up right here made
[1:16:22] the lap like stair steps going up the
[1:16:25] seven Church agents now
[1:16:27] listen watch this right here every evil
[1:16:31] that was in that first church lapped
[1:16:34] over into the next one in other words we
[1:16:36] didn't leave him back under he came
[1:16:38] right on up and he lapped over too he
[1:16:41] sent his Porter and his
[1:16:47] messenger just kept going on down until
[1:16:50] finally it ends up in complete in
[1:16:52] complete apostasy in the last age every
[1:16:56] evil just keeps lapping over in each
[1:16:58] church every little ISM that started out
[1:17:01] like in Genesis Divine started growing
[1:17:03] it weaved its way through the church and
[1:17:06] comes out in the last days no wonder the
[1:17:08] Bible said blessed are they that escape
[1:17:10] in that day yes sir that escapes all
[1:17:14] these things and here's where I wrote I
[1:17:16] wrote look the lap over equals
[1:17:19] Grace it was the grace of God that the
[1:17:21] people in Paul's age were getting so
[1:17:23] lacked and so laxidasical they they quit
[1:17:27] going to church all the time and and it
[1:17:29] sound like now get laxidasical you you
[1:17:33] well there's they probably ain't nothing
[1:17:35] you know brother Wade's probably going
[1:17:36] to preach for a couple hours and we're
[1:17:39] going to have to sit there and man if I
[1:17:42] shut my eyes he's going to scream at me
[1:17:44] well if you wouldn't shut your eyes I
[1:17:45] wouldn't scream at you kind of takes
[1:17:48] care of
[1:17:49] that but
[1:17:52] uh you know brother brandham he raised
[1:17:54] his voice too
[1:17:58] remember the bride got out of
[1:18:00] Step he said I woke up from the dream
[1:18:03] with my hands out like this saying get
[1:18:06] in line amen right amen right so if the
[1:18:09] prophet messenger can say get in line we
[1:18:12] should be able to say get in
[1:18:16] line most of our problems are originate
[1:18:19] by not being in
[1:18:21] line then like I said before then you
[1:18:23] trying to you want this magic fairy or
[1:18:25] you want this magic prayer to be prayed
[1:18:26] or you want this this magic switch to be
[1:18:29] flipped come on there is one it's called
[1:18:33] you it's called doing what God said if
[1:18:35] you sit down I promise you you sit down
[1:18:38] your chair when you go home and I'm
[1:18:39] going to quit right here you sit down
[1:18:41] magicians come on y'all don't sit down
[1:18:43] come on you sit down in your chair if I
[1:18:47] say sit
[1:18:49] down if I don't finish this I'm going to
[1:18:51] forget it you going to sit down at your
[1:18:54] house today
[1:18:55] and I want you to do that just for about
[1:18:56] 5 minutes sit down somewhere and say God
[1:18:59] am I doing everything I'm supposed to
[1:19:04] do to progress further with
[1:19:08] you just just give yourself five
[1:19:11] minutes do I have ought against my
[1:19:13] brother do I have all against my sister
[1:19:15] am I not going to church because I don't
[1:19:17] like the person sitting beside
[1:19:22] me I'm just standing over here I I
[1:19:25] wasn't condemning I was just standing
[1:19:26] here I thought maybe he didn't hear
[1:19:30] me Susan said I like
[1:19:33] you brother collie did not say anything
[1:19:37] back I like her you like her too
[1:19:45] okay but let's be
[1:19:48] honest sometimes like we said
[1:19:52] before sometimes we want that magic pill
[1:19:56] we want that quick get rich quick
[1:19:59] scheme but remember
[1:20:02] Christianity it's not a
[1:20:04] microwave it's a
[1:20:07] Crockpot a very slow crockpot you know
[1:20:10] when you turn it on low it takes all day
[1:20:12] to cook in beans but boy at the end of
[1:20:14] the day and beans are
[1:20:17] good so you ask yourself today let's all
[1:20:20] stand you ask yourself today am I doing
[1:20:24] every thing I need to do for God to move
[1:20:27] in my
[1:20:29] life if you say well I can't I can't I
[1:20:32] can't I can't I can't can't quit this
[1:20:33] and I can't quit that I can't all right
[1:20:36] it starts with you amen remember I said
[1:20:39] the other day the Bible says that little
[1:20:41] small scripture says resist the devil
[1:20:44] and he'll flee from you now wait a
[1:20:45] minute I didn't say
[1:20:48] assist I said
[1:20:53] resist I like that song the things I
[1:20:55] used to do you know have seeing it I do
[1:20:57] them no more why I'm a different person
[1:21:01] I've Been Changed we're looking for a
[1:21:03] change it started the day God entered
[1:21:06] your soul AB you started your change of
[1:21:09] your body cuz it starts from the inside
[1:21:11] it's not going to be some switch you
[1:21:13] flip it's going to be when the inside
[1:21:15] guy takes over the outside guy sometimes
[1:21:17] we let the outside guy take over the
[1:21:19] inside guy because of the sin that's all
[1:21:21] the way around us and the things we know
[1:21:23] we shouldn't do we do them anyway that's
[1:21:26] called
[1:21:27] iniquity so don't blame the
[1:21:33] preacher don't blame the
[1:21:35] deacons look in the mirror blame that
[1:21:39] person I told my daughter one time she
[1:21:42] was saying she she does this because of
[1:21:48] this I said well let me tell you
[1:21:51] something I wasn't there to pour that
[1:21:55] alcohol in you I wasn't there and shoved
[1:21:59] them pills down your throat I said you
[1:22:01] took them in your
[1:22:03] hand and you put them in your
[1:22:05] mouth you open the
[1:22:08] bottle and you drank it nobody forced
[1:22:12] you you did it on your own you did it
[1:22:15] yourself now there are times when I
[1:22:18] understand you're forced to do things
[1:22:20] but no not like what I'm talking about
[1:22:22] no you can't blame nobody you can't
[1:22:24] blame nobody but
[1:22:29] yourself well I you started with the
[1:22:32] right word
[1:22:38] I
[1:22:40] listen we're all here to
[1:22:43] help but we can't help one person that
[1:22:46] don't want
[1:22:47] help you cannot help somebody that don't

[1:31:44] today their last breath is going to be
[1:31:46] drawn on this side and if they ain't
[1:31:49] made a decision
[1:31:51] yes as the tree falls at the tree leans
[1:31:55] that's how it's going to
[1:31:56] fall we're not guaranteed one breath
[1:31:59] that's right not not even one yet every
[1:32:02] day we just breathe in and out it's just
[1:32:04] an automatic process your body breathes
[1:32:05] out your cells do the work it gets rid
[1:32:08] of the carbon dioxide it brings the
[1:32:10] oxygen in you got all the impurities
[1:32:12] that go in and out you eat and all the
[1:32:14] different things and you're and people
[1:32:16] spit in God's
[1:32:18] face oh how I love him he created your
[1:32:22] body
[1:32:25] gave you
[1:32:26] life now what are you doing with
[1:32:29] it what are you doing with it what are
[1:32:32] you doing with this
[1:32:34] gospel that all those people down
[1:32:36] through those Church ages we know
[1:32:37] there's one thing for sure during the
[1:32:39] Dark Ages there was 68 million
[1:32:42] Christians killed that's on books that's
[1:32:45] not just saying well I think it might
[1:32:47] have been no in the martyrology you read
[1:32:49] Fox's book of Martyrs Catholic Church
[1:32:51] put it out they killed 68 8 million
[1:32:55] people for being
[1:32:57] Christians and turning the Catholic
[1:32:59] Church
[1:33:02] down and we have a bad day and we go
[1:33:04] crawling under the sheets and say oh God
[1:33:06] I'm so you've left
[1:33:09] me he said I'll
[1:33:12] never never
[1:33:14] what oh never leave you nor forsake you
[1:33:18] like I said before he can't turn against
[1:33:20] you if he loved you from the beginning
[1:33:23] he's going to love you all the way the
[1:33:24] body change and he's going to love you I
[1:33:27] I just before we go I I had a a friend
[1:33:30] of ours uh past away not too long ago
[1:33:33] and he was a very good very good person
[1:33:35] he wasn't a Believer but he was so good
[1:33:37] to the family so good to us and
[1:33:39] different things and you know we always
[1:33:41] wonder why does why
[1:33:43] does he was probably you know 40
[1:33:46] something years old 45 years old why
[1:33:48] does God take somebody like
[1:33:50] that
[1:33:52] well if he's going to be given eternal
[1:33:55] life because of you one day God did him
[1:33:57] a
[1:33:59] favor he ain't got to worry about
[1:34:01] nothing else to the white
[1:34:02] Throne he ain't got to worry about bills
[1:34:06] he ain't got to worry about getting sick
[1:34:08] again he's not going have to worry about
[1:34:10] going through that awful tribulation
[1:34:11] that's coming God has took him and
[1:34:14] preserved
[1:34:15] him let me give you a little secret he
[1:34:18] preserved them for
[1:34:21] you he preserved them for you that's how
[1:34:26] much he thinks about me and you even the
[1:34:28] people that we associate with is good to
[1:34:30] me and you the Bible says a couple water
[1:34:32] in my name will not be forgotten here or
[1:34:35] there so we've seen people that's been
[1:34:37] in our in our families and different
[1:34:39] things been really good friends and you
[1:34:40] wonder why Lord did he did them a favor
[1:34:44] he took them out of all this and he's
[1:34:46] got them preserved in a place and
[1:34:47] they're standing there waiting and it's
[1:34:48] the white Throne judgment God knows they
[1:34:50] going to get eternal
[1:34:51] life because of you
[1:34:56] and what you
[1:34:57] represent boy don't ever listen folks
[1:34:59] don't ever sell ourselves short that's
[1:35:01] right we're the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:35:03] we're not arrogant and we're not but we
[1:35:05] can be
[1:35:06] boastful about what the Bible
[1:35:08] says we can boast in what God's done for
[1:35:12] us we can boast that we are in this
[1:35:14] Bible and God's going to take care of us
[1:35:16] brother John he's going to take care of
[1:35:17] us he's going to take care of our family
[1:35:20] he going to take care but remember go
[1:35:22] home for about 10 minutes and just sit
[1:35:23] down and said look God am I doing
[1:35:24] everything I need to do cuz remember
[1:35:26] brother random said look he said when

[1:35:45] is at the Red Sea he told Moses he said
[1:35:47] you tell them he said you tell them
[1:35:48] stand right there don't go running off
[1:35:50] now if any went running all over the
[1:35:52] place God had never produced what he
[1:35:54] produced that great miracle the part in
[1:35:55] the sea but he said tell them to stand
[1:35:57] still and see the salvation of the Lord
