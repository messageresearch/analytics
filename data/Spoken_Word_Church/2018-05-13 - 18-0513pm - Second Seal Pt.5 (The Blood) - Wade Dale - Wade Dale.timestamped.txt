[5:40] talk about this is his brand-new 2018
[5:45] Hyundai Sonata mmm last Sunday I was on
[5:51] my way to church he called me he was in
[5:53] the cop car on his way to jail he had
[5:58] hung out in Atlanta on Saturday Cinco de
[6:02] Mayo and he thought he couldn't make it
[6:04] to South Carolina to visit another buddy
[6:07] he got on i-20 on Sunday morning about
[6:11] eight o'clock he called me before I
[6:13] arrived here at the parking lot oh
[6:17] brother go ahead and show that other
[6:19] picture brother Joe okay
[6:22] this is us going back to the site you
[6:24] see the long guardrail I know you can't
[6:27] see it that well I'll tell you he didn't
[6:29] hit that guardrail he hit the steel
[6:32] columns on this sign you see the sign is
[6:36] toppled over that's that big old sign on
[6:38] the side of the road okay that probably
[6:40] kept him from paralleling further down
[6:43] into the woods we went by this site on
[6:46] Tuesday and we picked up one shoe and
[6:49] one shoe and charged her stuff and a
[6:51] brush and some toiletries were further
[6:53] down in there on last Sunday morning an
[6:59] EMS person off-duty emergency medical
[7:02] services person paul kendrick out of the
[7:06] sunroof out of this sunroof cuz that's
[7:09] the only way they can get him out
[7:12] brought him to the hospital
[7:15] Kendrick has just an inflamed shoulder
[7:19] nothing broken we've investigated
[7:23] possible head injury
[7:25] or anything like that nothing you see
[7:27] how this boy is playing with the devil
[7:29] old slewfoot okay oh I forgot to tell
[7:31] you the testimony about my mom I'm sorry
[7:33] my father we think there is a genetic
[7:35] disposition to this of course you and I
[7:37] know who this is
[7:38] okay but we can't deny my father was an
[7:42] alcoholic my um my mother Blessed Mother
[7:46] um we left my father when I was seven
[7:50] years old because there was domestic
[7:51] violence involved with his drinking they
[7:54] both put each other in the hospital at
[7:56] one point but anyway we left him we went
[7:58] to stay with my grandmother in a two
[8:01] room apartment
[8:03] that's seven women in a two room
[8:07] apartment we stayed with her until we
[8:08] were able to get our own place my mother
[8:10] never filed for child support she raised
[8:14] five girls single-handedly she always
[8:18] invited him to all the family functions
[8:20] but she never charged him when we're
[8:22] done penny she raised us by herself okay
[8:26] so back to Kendrick nothing at the
[8:27] hospital
[8:28] this boy is playing with fire this is
[8:30] the third one I picked him up from Green
[8:34] County Jail last Sunday after I left
[8:36] here from church he knows it it's a
[8:39] wake-up call he knows God in his life he
[8:41] knows that he says that he's been with
[8:43] me all week we'll see how it goes but I
[8:45] want you all to pray pray and don't just
[8:49] pray one time keep praying because
[8:51] there's loz after us through on the high
[8:54] on the roads he's after us cuz I had you
[8:56] know Bambi hitting me at my car I hit I
[8:59] tell and it's Owen on the left so he's
[9:01] after us if you'll just remember to keep
[9:03] on praying okay oh man the highlight of
[9:06] this other people stopped and they
[9:09] picked the pissed off and put it in the
[9:10] overnight bag he had he had a pair of
[9:14] pants on now he stopped by our lines
[9:17] house to get some other things got off
[9:19] at my accident got an energy drink but
[9:23] in his pants pocket that he didn't have
[9:25] on he put them in the trunk there was a
[9:27] sizable amount of cash in the pocket
[9:31] when we went to that site or when we
[9:33] went to the collision place to get the
[9:35] rest of the stuff out the car those pair
[9:37] of pants was
[9:38] the truck with the cash in it but God
[9:42] and God has a sense of humor and he
[9:44] would drop the mic right now but God
[9:47] thank you I had a friend of ours one
[10:03] time Terrance Nuri
[10:07] great Wyatt was driving the truck for us
[10:10] and he had about two accidents and he
[10:15] actually went into an old barn he's a
[10:19] phenomenal Christian guy and he he told
[10:23] us when we got down there he said I am
[10:25] so glad God was riding with me there was
[10:29] an older gentleman come out of his house
[10:30] and was standing there watching us and
[10:32] he looked over at Rick and he said you
[10:34] keep driving like that he won't so let's
[10:37] stand our feet point well-taken
[10:44] so we've seen these things you know Josh
[10:48] did the same thing he had a my son had
[10:51] an accident several many years ago now
[10:53] and remember that and the people swore
[10:59] another man got out of the car they
[11:01] thought there was a guy in the car with
[11:02] him well we know who that was it was his
[11:04] guardian angel dusting himself off
[11:06] because of what happened in him the same
[11:09] way so we need to keep kinder all our
[11:12] kids in their prayer amen we'll talk
[11:14] about that in just a minute if we get to
[11:15] it about something - Lord show me about
[11:19] applying as token so let's go to
[11:22] revelation 6 verse 1 and we'll begin
[11:25] here we're still on the second seal we
[11:29] will since I got both services next
[11:31] Sunday we will thinks - pops gonna take
[11:35] a little R&R time and that's good he
[11:37] deserves it after all these years he
[11:39] needs some good are in our times so I
[11:42] think we missing for one Sunday maybe
[11:45] okay all right
[11:48] but just pray for us we should finish up
[11:51] with the second seal I I keep you keep
[11:54] seeing things and I you know downstairs
[11:57] we're in the book of Romans and even
[12:00] starting in the book of Romans the Lord
[12:02] just really impressed on me to start up
[12:03] just a Bible study about the book of
[12:05] Romans not you know not what the Prophet
[12:07] said and not what you know a good a
[12:09] Bible study of what Paul was talking to
[12:11] the people about and once you see that
[12:13] though you start looking at
[12:15] justification then you look at
[12:16] sanctification you look at all the the
[12:19] things that the Prophet said but when
[12:20] brother Brown said that the Bible became
[12:23] a brand-new book he was not joking he
[12:25] was telling the truth that that man had
[12:28] read the Bible since the 20s I guess
[12:30] when he was a young man and he had he
[12:32] had combed through the Bible and you
[12:34] know and probably wore a couple out but
[12:37] that Bible became a brand-new book it
[12:39] didn't become new as in physical but
[12:42] when brother Adam would read it then he
[12:43] could see more of in depth of what God
[12:46] already had in there when some extra
[12:50] these thunders are not something extra
[12:52] but what it does it ties the entire
[12:54] Bible together it makes you when you
[12:58] look at this Word of God and you see
[13:00] it's like brother Dale said this morning
[13:02] and you we have to see it this way that
[13:06] God is talking to several different
[13:08] groups of people in the Bible sure it's
[13:12] sure it's written for Christians amen
[13:15] but it is talking to the center because
[13:17] the center has to hear this and respond
[13:21] but now as we become more mature like
[13:24] brother Dale with so much this morning
[13:25] you know being a baby in Christ which is
[13:28] good and and drinking milk is good but I
[13:30] like some good strong meat you know in
[13:33] same way here is when we can read the
[13:35] Bible over again and you get a little
[13:36] more read the Bible you get a little
[13:38] more a baby can read it and just and
[13:42] just glean all kinds of things but then
[13:44] you go back and read it with a greater
[13:48] revelation you thought man where'd that
[13:50] come from well it's been in there the
[13:52] whole time it's been in there since
[13:54] since they put the Bible together so
[13:55] that's just the way God is you know this
[13:57] is the way we're gonna this is brother
[13:59] Brian the only way we're going to know
[14:01] by God there's no other book there's no
[14:04] other prophet to come there's no other
[14:07] this to come there's no this is it this
[14:10] is it and God is so gracious I was
[14:12] telling them this morning
[14:13] when Paul was writing to the Romans when
[14:17] Paul was writing to the Romans when Paul
[14:18] will get up and preach a sermon you
[14:21] couldn't fall asleep or you couldn't lay
[14:25] out cuz you know what we got all this
[14:28] now Paul when he preached him when Peter
[14:31] preached they had to go home and they
[14:34] had to glean that in their head but you
[14:36] know what the Holy Ghost will bring back
[14:38] what to your remembrance what's been
[14:42] said all right so that's what we need to
[14:44] depend on because you know quotes will
[14:47] kill you Paul said the letter killeth I
[14:49] can take these quotes and make them all
[14:51] different kind of things but remember
[14:54] God doesn't change his words the same in
[14:58] you know if I can't depend on anything
[14:59] else I depend on that God's Word will
[15:01] never change if he did it the first time
[15:04] one ways god I'd do it the same the next
[15:07] way okay so let's uh let's go to the
[15:09] Lord and pray the only father you've
[15:11] heard the testimony this morning or this
[15:14] afternoon Lord that you do watch over us
[15:17] even in our time of ignorance in the
[15:20] time that we all had the conversation
[15:23] Paul said in times past in the world
[15:25] the things that we done Lord you you're
[15:28] still has that angel watching over us
[15:30] and I pray now that you would just not
[15:32] just watch over Kendrick but Lord may
[15:35] you give him the baptism of the Holy go
[15:36] and that would look over him more than
[15:39] anything
[15:40] Lord not to be watched over but to be an
[15:43] N word dwelling being father we ask you
[15:46] Lord to be with us here be with all the
[15:48] mothers give them a good day today Lord
[15:51] and thank you for each one thank you for
[15:54] the good weather we've been having lord
[15:56] I thank you for all the things that
[15:58] you've given us the safe trips and
[16:00] journeys that we took we pray that you
[16:02] would just be with the ones that are not
[16:03] here Lord be the ones that are sick we
[16:05] were the ones Lord in the foreign fields
[16:07] give them a fruit for their labor father
[16:08] just be with us today in the further
[16:10] ment of this service be the active
[16:11] participant Lord you be the speaker you
[16:14] be the hero father and
[16:15] with Jesus we ask these things amen
[16:18] revelation 6 verse 1 and I saw him when
[16:21] the lamb opened one of the seals and I
[16:22] heard it were the voice of thunder one
[16:23] of the four beasts say come and see and
[16:25] I saw him behold a white horse and he
[16:27] that sat on him out of the bow and the
[16:29] crown was given unto him and he went
[16:30] forth conquering and to conquer and
[16:32] we've been through that already and when
[16:35] he had opened the second seal I heard
[16:36] the second beast say come and see
[16:38] so in other words the second beast which
[16:40] is the ox made a call come John John you
[16:43] taught the bride John come and see come
[16:46] and see what's going on all right and
[16:48] there went out another horse that was
[16:51] red and power was given to him that sat
[16:53] thereon to take peace from the earth
[16:54] that they should kill one another and
[16:56] there was given unto him a great sword
[16:58] you may be seated in the Lord is
[17:00] blessing to the reading of the word now
[17:02] what we've been doing is is we've been
[17:03] looking at the second seal which is hey
[17:08] hope he good girl I told him we had
[17:10] church on Sunday afternoon and she
[17:12] decided to come that's one of my other
[17:17] daughters that I pray for what we pray
[17:24] for them all you know that we all grew
[17:25] up together like that most of you young
[17:29] ones you know everybody was there at the
[17:31] hospital when you were born almost
[17:34] church family I think's supposed to be
[17:37] stronger than then then human mortal
[17:39] family anyway yeah man we're all one in
[17:42] the body of Christ yeah and I truly
[17:45] believe that I think God does too God
[17:47] believe it's his own word but brother
[17:49] Brian said that one time he said not God
[17:51] God believes his own word amen
[17:53] why when he said let there be he didn't
[17:55] stutter amen he in started when he said
[17:58] let us make man I don't know he had the
[18:00] whole thing worked out so and that's
[18:02] what we're trying to we we were in
[18:03] Arizona and thank you for your prayers
[18:05] we had a real good time we visited some
[18:08] really nice places and brother Chris has
[18:10] got a real nice church very strong in
[18:12] the word didn't have to do a lot of
[18:14] background or fill in they were right
[18:18] there with us so small group maybe
[18:20] twelve fourteen people but you know what
[18:23] the ephesian church was a powerful
[18:25] church and they had 12 people so
[18:27] I'd rather have 12 people with the holy
[18:29] ghost and hundred without a man all
[18:33] right so now we're looking at the at
[18:35] redemption so now we're we're still
[18:37] we're not looking so much at the horse
[18:41] rider because we know that was read and
[18:43] we know that that was that he went forth
[18:45] conquering in the first three Church
[18:48] ages and in that fourth Church age he
[18:50] settles in and attaches itself to that
[18:53] middle church age and will not get the
[18:55] chart out today I'll try to be a little
[18:57] bit shorter today since I got next
[19:00] Sunday both services so so we can we can
[19:03] be a little short today and and let you
[19:05] get home and visit your mama if you if
[19:07] your mom ain't here so and also for
[19:11] about five minutes after the service all
[19:13] the men that are have anything to do or
[19:16] want to have anything to do with the
[19:17] Father's Day fishing trip we're going to
[19:20] have to postpone the one that we usually
[19:23] do we've been doing it for I don't know
[19:25] close to ten years I guess going through
[19:28] the Chattahoochee River upper
[19:29] Chattahoochee and trout fishing and
[19:30] camping well that's all been closed off
[19:32] because of the rain and they've had a
[19:34] big landslide and the road got washed
[19:36] out so we can't go there this year after
[19:39] about ten years of doing it it was
[19:40] really nice so we're gonna have to
[19:42] either find another place postpone it or
[19:44] do something different so we need to
[19:46] meet for about five minutes if you don't
[19:47] mind down at the picnic table and we
[19:50] will let's go over a few options and see
[19:53] what what we want to do that's that's a
[19:55] real good time we've always had a good
[19:56] time there so well let's just pray about
[19:58] them so now Redemption now remember the
[20:01] breaking of the seals is not necessarily
[20:03] for the soul like we're talking about
[20:04] the soul is redeemed by the new birth
[20:06] the shed blood of Jesus Christ and I was
[20:08] telling the brothers out in Arizona you
[20:12] got to remember one thing that you're
[20:14] not saved by the blood you know I saved
[20:17] by the blood you're saved by the life in
[20:20] the blood but you're kept saved by the
[20:23] blood I got a quote on quote it in just
[20:25] a few minutes for brother Aaron said
[20:26] you're not saved by the blood listen you
[20:28] could take all the blood of Jesus Christ
[20:31] that ever was in his sacred wonderful
[20:33] body pour it all over you and you would
[20:36] just be wet that's what we do with a lot
[20:41] of people
[20:41] baptize them when they don't repent we
[20:43] just have a bunch of wet sinners hey man
[20:46] but we don't want that but once you take
[20:48] that life though and put it inside of a
[20:50] person see then that blood then it's
[20:54] like you put it over the lentil of the
[20:55] doorpost you put that blood out their
[20:57] own display what can wash away my sin
[21:02] nothing but the blood but it's the life
[21:05] in the blood amen it's the life in the
[21:08] blood so we need to look at this as we
[21:10] see red because remember the seals are
[21:13] not necessarily I say nothing
[21:16] necessarily because you can hear them
[21:18] and get something off of it and it will
[21:20] help you but it's like I was telling
[21:22] them in Arizona mm-hmm you got to do you
[21:24] got a compartmentalize things okay
[21:30] because remember and they looked a
[21:32] little cross-eyed and you made two but
[21:35] your body doesn't sin flesh this body
[21:40] that you're looking at it's a product of
[21:42] sin but this body you're looking at it's
[21:45] not sin it's like brother Chris said
[21:47] he's just what holds all the guts and
[21:48] stuff together yeah that's what it is
[21:50] the whole it's the framework you say how
[21:53] can you prove that brother branham what
[21:57] is sin he said it's not smoking drinking
[22:01] gambling running around What did he say
[22:06] unbelief was I mean saying was unbelief
[22:12] and where does that come from this guy
[22:15] you looking over this this right now it
[22:17] doesn't come from this guy that was a
[22:22] Freudian slip of the phone but this
[22:25] thing right here that's not sin I'm
[22:29] gonna live in this for an eternity
[22:32] this same hand that you see used to hold
[22:37] the beer in his hand used to hold the
[22:38] beer now God didn't take this thing off
[22:41] and throw it away and bring me a new one
[22:43] no he cleaned up this one what he
[22:46] changed the one on the inside amen so
[22:50] that's our problem is we go oh I'm just
[22:52] I said in my flesh no you do not you
[22:58] manifest that sin with your flesh a man
[23:04] because the motivator it's not the flesh
[23:08] it's like I was telling them out in
[23:10] Arizona you take somebody and you sever
[23:13] their spine in a young boy god forbid
[23:16] but you do that and that kid lays in a
[23:19] bed for the rest of his life
[23:20] now you can't account his flesh to sin
[23:25] but he's a sinner in God's eyes if he
[23:27] don't give his heart to Christ hey man
[23:30] so maybe we look into things thing just
[23:32] a little bit different I was telling
[23:33] them downstairs
[23:35] the Bible says if this earthly
[23:37] tabernacle were dissolved were dissolved
[23:42] I'm not gonna be part of that I'm not
[23:49] if this earthly tabernacle work dissolve
[23:53] we have one waiting but what if I get
[23:57] this one changed it won't deal of that's
[24:01] what we're trying to do with these cells
[24:03] is we're trying to bring our mentality
[24:05] it's like I said before you know when my
[24:08] brother branham was preaching the breach
[24:10] I know you've heard it I'm gonna tell
[24:12] you again but brother Branham was
[24:14] preaching the breach all down to the
[24:16] seven churches I'll fly away Oh glory
[24:20] when I die you're buying buy that's all
[24:22] in you
[24:24] now we sing I can't die hallelujah by
[24:28] and by why because we've come to a
[24:29] revelation that somebody is going to
[24:32] take a body change so brother Branham in
[24:36] the breech he listened the the property
[24:40] guard to do two things remember he's
[24:41] supposed to turn the hearts of the
[24:42] children back to the faith the father's
[24:44] not tell us how to not drink smoke
[24:46] gambling all the other stuff like daddy
[24:47] said with my brother Dale was saying
[24:48] this morning brother Bob didn't come to
[24:51] freeze holiness he met holiness people
[24:57] but he changed what he took the
[25:00] doctrines that were wrong that they were
[25:02] preaching that's all loose ends that's
[25:05] what he was somebody he puts the loose
[25:06] ends back together hey man hey man so
[25:11] that's nothing new it's just what he
[25:14] does like Elijah he rebuilt the altar
[25:18] remember who tore it down the prophets
[25:21] of Bale's one who tore the altar down
[25:23] remember they jumped up and down on his
[25:24] screen and hollered right well Elijah
[25:27] but the altar bang he restored worship
[25:31] back to where God could talk to us amen
[25:36] we're glad could speak bring full
[25:40] fellowship into manifestation that's
[25:43] what I'm looking at full fellowship back
[25:46] into manifestation where Elijah put -
[25:48] what do you do when he put that altar
[25:51] back together God came down God came
[25:55] down and vindicated that prophet I
[25:57] believe God's vindicated our prophet but
[26:00] remember like brother Dale said this
[26:02] morning and I you know what I'd never
[26:05] seen it like that before because God
[26:07] forbid some people believe that brother
[26:10] Branham fulfilled all five offices which
[26:13] is fine I believe that apostle prophet
[26:15] pass was teaching advantage that right
[26:17] but that would mean singular read your
[26:21] Bible it says he gave some prophets
[26:25] some evangelists some pastors and
[26:31] teachers
[26:33] that's all poor all a man he gave it
[26:39] it's all plural not singular but we had
[26:43] to hear it from one person a man it used
[26:47] to be a one man message it's not anymore
[26:49] amen amen it's a fivefold ministry
[26:53] prophets apostles pastors I you know
[26:56] what I never even read it a million
[26:58] times so of you they're all plural one
[27:01] person is not plural one person is
[27:05] people it's God sent people to show us
[27:09] this book of redemption in clarity
[27:14] that's what we're trying to do now we're
[27:16] trying to make everybody see more clear
[27:21] what God has already said brother
[27:25] Branham you can write in your Bible he
[27:28] said I'd be Antichrist amen but to bring
[27:33] the Bible that we already have to where
[27:36] we can read it as a center and get saved
[27:38] but we can also read it and get meat
[27:42] because I promise you your body change
[27:44] lays in that Bible you got in your lap
[27:47] but it will not change you as long as
[27:49] you leave that Bible land in your lap
[27:52] hey man God does not want fellowship
[27:58] with a book he won't spell oh with
[28:02] somebody with skin on it hey man Adam
[28:07] didn't have a book in the in the
[28:09] beginning you think we're gonna have a
[28:11] booking in no you are the book what I
[28:17] want to bring today I want us to see
[28:18] this but let's stop and get a little
[28:21] head of myself now sanctification under
[28:25] the seals remember well let me finish my
[28:29] thought
[28:29] thank you lord but brother branham what
[28:31] did he do he come to do two things turn
[28:35] the hearts of the father's back to the
[28:36] children right
[28:37] or the children to the father's sorry
[28:40] children to the father's faith of the
[28:41] father so that we'd be more - or a
[28:43] father it's not a baby
[28:45] all right father's a mature man so he's
[28:47] bringing us back to that and then number
[28:49] two he's supposed to what literally he's
[28:52] supposed to bring the seven thunders at
[28:53] a literally turn us back so that's what
[28:55] he did in the breach like I said before
[28:59] there were many bursts in the seven
[29:01] churches they were all good they were
[29:05] all right according to their time amen
[29:10] but in this end time it's required that
[29:14] there be a birth from according to my
[29:17] life or a man I think I read that last
[29:22] Sunday fund seventy four left but
[29:24] there's a requirement now that we are to
[29:27] be literally what we have listened to
[29:30] listen to me what we have listened to
[29:33] all of our life has got to change
[29:38] it's got to change
[29:40] so I took a profit to turn a corner oh
[29:45] sure we can may oh yeah well Gary Krantz
[29:48] is not here but some of you builders I
[29:50] mean man I can put that wall up but turn
[29:56] a corner or cut an angle call a
[30:00] professional collects no I can't do that
[30:03] and that's what we had to do God had to
[30:06] call a professional brother branham with
[30:10] the Holy Ghost
[30:11] and the anointing of the Prophet not
[30:13] just any profit but the profit in the
[30:15] end time
[30:17] revelations ten seven but in the days of
[30:19] the voice of the seventh angel when he
[30:21] shall begin to begin to sound so what
[30:23] did he do in that breach sure he
[30:25] preached Redemption but we're at the end
[30:29] of the church ages and we're getting
[30:30] ready to go into his greatest ministry
[30:32] that since Jesus Christ
[30:36] that's what he said he said I've never
[30:39] worked in this realm of anointing in my
[30:42] life he's seen 25,000 people get healed
[30:45] and saved at one time to me to me
[30:48] brother Donnie they'd be I'm done that's
[30:50] all I knew
[30:51] no that was just that was just what that
[30:54] was just the glare to get people to see
[30:57] the message so in the breach what did he
[31:01] do in the breach we told you before that
[31:05] what is a breech birth a breech birth is
[31:08] as the baby comes feet first that's not
[31:11] a normal birth but it is a birth the
[31:16] baby comes the baby is alive but that's
[31:18] not a normal birth watch the normal
[31:20] birth head first amen so the prophet of
[31:25] God was what he did I believe in
[31:26] Revelations 5 nobody ever seen this
[31:28] before he had to reach in not to a
[31:31] natural womb don't think perverted with
[31:33] me buddy
[31:34] what is the womb of a Christian your
[31:37] mind is your womb a man what God doesn't
[31:42] deal by the loins of man or women
[31:43] anymore not corruptible stuff like that
[31:46] but he deals in the womb of your mind so
[31:50] the prophet of God had to read literal
[31:52] he rescinded I don't know if he did you
[31:55] but he did me he reached into the womb
[31:58] of my mind and he changed my thinking
[32:01] hey man that's where God talks to me
[32:04] that's where the fertility of the bride
[32:06] is is in her mind the womb of her mind
[32:10] so God through a prophet a masterbuilder
[32:16] he said ok reached births are alright
[32:21] it's a birth but I want to introduce the
[32:26] head so the head had to come first
[32:30] those cells are the headstone to the
[32:34] church amen it's never been priests
[32:38] before so brother Branham couldn't
[32:40] preach it to the normal people he said
[32:45] it's gone from you you're not gonna get
[32:48] it
[32:49] I'm just telling you what he said on
[32:51] questions and answers on the seals and
[32:53] then he said it's gone from you you're
[32:56] not even supposed to get it and then it
[32:59] starts talking about voices coming
[33:00] through the room and there be a crystal
[33:03] and there's not the right crystal there
[33:05] at the time but I believe today ladies
[33:07] and gentlemen brothers and sister the
[33:10] crystal is here the right receptor is
[33:14] here to receive the days of the voice of
[33:19] the seventh angel he has turned us to
[33:24] where well we was going to die I told
[33:28] him I told bitkeeper friend of mine he
[33:30] said these three things this that will
[33:32] hinder your beekeeping ability he said
[33:35] these three people you don't want in
[33:37] your bee yard can't good and wouldn't so
[33:44] take it with a Christian experience I
[33:46] can't well you just stopped yourself
[33:48] I couldn't Jesus stopped yourself
[33:52] I would you've just stopped yourself I
[33:54] thought the Bible says we can do all
[33:56] things through Christ who strengtheneth
[34:00] and when God says all things he means
[34:05] all things amen
[34:07] so this sanctification when when the
[34:10] prophet of God then had to turn us to
[34:13] get that correct birth what did he bring
[34:17] he brought the seals right after that he
[34:20] brought him correct he brought him the
[34:22] way they were supposed to come but
[34:23] nobody got it what about preaching to a
[34:27] brother Larry you weren't there
[34:29] you weren't there wounded your youth
[34:31] everyone brother branham was here no
[34:33] okay
[34:34] well some of you were sister Cletus not
[34:35] here today but some of you were there
[34:37] brother hal was there when brother
[34:38] Branham preached a lot of times now if
[34:40] he'll tell you oh I'm sorry
[34:42] Larry and Larry and Jamie lariat Jeanie
[34:45] I was just gonna leave you alone since
[34:46] is your anniversary sighs don't leave me
[34:48] alone but listen I've heard I've heard
[34:52] people though out of their own mouth
[34:55] tell me they went to Jeffersonville to
[34:59] watch brother Branham and they didn't
[35:01] hardly listen to anything he said
[35:02] sermon they wanted to see the signs and
[35:05] wonders so it wasn't for them but it's
[35:15] for us it's for us more blessed it is
[35:19] him that did not see and receive what
[35:22] God's already brought they managed to
[35:24] ask me in you so listen as we
[35:28] compartmentalize this it wasn't for them
[35:30] to leave them alone they're gone
[35:32] actually most them are passed away but
[35:34] you know what brother Branham was not
[35:36] calling them was not saying they weren't
[35:38] Christians he just said you're not
[35:41] getting this it's not for you in other
[35:44] words the womb of your mind has been so
[35:46] polluted my ideas denominational ideas
[35:52] till I can't talk to you right now but
[35:57] they'll be a group they'll be a group
[36:02] that'll have the potential to hear
[36:07] exactly what I'm saying not compromise
[36:11] on anything that first seal identified
[36:19] that were a white righteous Church you
[36:25] see I'm not talking about what happened
[36:26] in the first three church ages like when
[36:29] we're reading in the book of Romans this
[36:31] morning he starts talking about those in
[36:34] Rome you know what I done I struck out
[36:36] Rome put Luther Georgia or wherever you
[36:38] live it's just a place so Paul was
[36:41] talking to the Saints at Lula brother
[36:44] branham's talking to the Saints at Lula
[36:47] wherever the true Word of God is
[36:49] preached not just here but I'm here now
[36:51] this is me all right so God speaking to
[36:54] me now there's no future age to come no
[37:00] more Church ages so there's not a future
[37:03] we can't say oh well I'll just take what
[37:05] I can get and I know some of you and I'm
[37:08] gonna say it will you love me or not
[37:11] if Henry Ford in nineteen when did he
[37:16] make the
[37:16] heimo Dhoni in 1908
[37:21] if Henry Ford would have stood at the
[37:24] end of the production line and said well
[37:27] it is what it is it would have took some
[37:32] of you four or five hours to get to
[37:34] church in a car with no air conditioning
[37:37] no windshield wipers no radio I just
[37:42] can't stand that word I can't stand it
[37:45] is what it is I can't accept that I'm
[37:48] sorry I can't well we got to go put them
[37:54] in the grave because it is what it is
[37:56] see the mentality of our mind is going
[37:59] to be changed turned and it's only from
[38:06] the prophets message people man can't
[38:10] turn you because man's gonna put you in
[38:11] a grave we all got die sometime listen
[38:17] you believe that if you want to if I
[38:20] fall dead right now I'm still gonna
[38:22] believe that I'm gonna be here and God's
[38:25] gonna use me change my body and use me
[38:29] to call the dead out of the ground now
[38:32] that doesn't make me anything but it
[38:35] makes God that's got a group of people
[38:37] that's gonna believe what he's already
[38:39] said not one another preachers burner
[38:42] another prophet is bringing there's no
[38:44] other prophet Jesus Christ is it done
[38:53] all right but what is this seal the red
[39:01] horse rider is what we looked at
[39:04] sanctification sanctification under the
[39:07] seal is cleaned and set aside for
[39:09] service but less compartmentalize this
[39:10] again if you're Sol if you're born again
[39:16] it's in your soul at this moment I say
[39:20] that at this moment it's in your soul it
[39:23] doesn't need anything else
[39:28] SEC Tournament God is it actually is not
[39:32] as eternal as God is it is God and that
[39:35] makes it eternal hey man it is God and
[39:40] it makes it eternal there's a light
[39:43] there that doesn't shine anywhere else
[39:46] hey man I'd hate to be the Death Angel
[39:49] come get a Christian yeah amen cuz he's
[39:56] not used to coming and picking up about
[39:58] 5 million volts of eternal life he's
[40:02] used to walking in and grabbing a sinner
[40:04] and saying come on buddy you going in
[40:07] the 5th dimension and you're gonna wait
[40:09] here you filthy thing know when he meets
[40:12] that son and daughter of God when that
[40:15] flesh breaks back and that real person
[40:19] stands up and says death where's he
[40:23] staying
[40:24] grave where's your big trick you take me
[40:28] what brother brown say we control death
[40:33] even in the time that our body quits
[40:36] breathing that soul inside of that
[40:40] person says no I'm not going with you
[40:44] you're going to take me you gonna take
[40:48] me death into that 6th dimension where
[40:51] you don't know anything about cuz
[40:53] there's no death there if you look at
[40:56] even death like that death to a
[40:59] Christian is not o Lord of mercy that
[41:06] right see that's what I think it is all
[41:09] other death angels gonna come get me one
[41:11] day even if he does he can't touch you
[41:16] he can't touch that eternal life that's
[41:21] in your soul so where do you need
[41:25] sanctification you don't need it for
[41:28] this guy right you don't need it for
[41:31] this flesh guy cuz remember it just
[41:33] holds everything together so you need
[41:36] sanctification for what that metal man
[41:40] memory reason conscious affection
[41:42] imagination that's what these are doing
[41:45] they're driving out the trash that's
[41:51] left over in your spirit realm amen
[41:57] now we take the seal which is what
[42:01] there's a red horse power was given to
[42:05] take peace and to kill and it was given
[42:07] unto him a great sword that was given
[42:10] unto them a great word why because it
[42:12] deceived the people and then we just we
[42:15] finished this morning in Romans 1
[42:17] whatever it was where that men hold the
[42:20] truth in unrighteousness
[42:21] they hold the truth but they hold it and
[42:25] twist it to unrighteousness hey man
[42:29] that's the problem today like we were
[42:32] talking this morning not brother Dale
[42:34] was 50 years ago taught us about
[42:37] interpolating you look in your Bible
[42:39] Paul is out Paul is writing a letter and
[42:42] all of a sudden there's a something in
[42:44] parentheses that's interpolation Paul is
[42:49] actually clear clarifying what God
[42:52] stands through him but it actually in
[42:54] Paul's in Paul's situation it's God
[42:58] expounding more because it's not Paul if
[43:01] it's in the Word of God it's not Paul
[43:03] that's God now you and I can interpolate
[43:06] and get it wrong then that's what
[43:09] happens to a lot of people they
[43:11] interpolate their own ideas and get it
[43:13] wrong but we you and I were given a
[43:16] great sword you and I are right now
[43:17] given a word a great word amen so so the
[43:23] the law of contrast if there was a white
[43:27] seem like white righteous church there
[43:29] had to be a white Rochester Church on
[43:31] earth so if there was a Red Rider that
[43:35] was that was riding through and killing
[43:38] people then there had to be there had to
[43:41] be a killing of self
[43:43] now listen those people in that for
[43:46] church hate people listen to me just to
[43:50] say they were a Christian was automatic
[43:53] physic
[43:55] automatic 68 million of them right
[44:01] that's equivalent to there's only like
[44:06] 16 no there's not there's 12 million
[44:08] people in the state of Georgia whole
[44:10] state five times that probably ever
[44:15] stayed on the eastern seaboard wiped out
[44:18] because of what they believe amen
[44:23] so the great sword that Satan was given
[44:26] was what to deceive the people but as
[44:30] that as we look back to that I see a
[44:33] great thing I see the word being
[44:36] fulfilled the court of wheat had to die
[44:39] go in the ground
[44:41] why so it could come back the right way
[44:46] amen
[44:49] you love the Lord amen so parallel in
[44:55] that fourth church age if you want to
[44:59] let's skip to number number four I know
[45:03] we went through this before I want to go
[45:05] through just another time number four
[45:07] let's just skip them all go to number
[45:10] four we've read these before but let's
[45:12] read this them number four is Redemption
[45:15] by judgment Jeffersonville Indiana oh if
[45:18] you notice red heifer notice being the
[45:21] female typing the church typing the
[45:25] church now you see topping the church so
[45:28] you're bringing it to the church cuz
[45:32] that's the problem we have the problem
[45:37] we have is is like I said before most
[45:40] message believers are tunas Jesus over
[45:47] here me over here well we know Jesus is
[45:49] God but can you say you are because if
[45:56] there's two people the prophet of God
[46:00] told us if you see that's what the seals
[46:02] revealed here stands a lamb and there
[46:05] goes somebody
[46:07] he said therefore that person must be
[46:10] the devil listen folks we have his
[46:16] answer more than anybody that's ever
[46:19] been on the face of this earth except
[46:21] Jesus Christ himself and I like to
[46:24] that's good you know what I'm not
[46:26] putting myself in that category God's
[46:28] putting me in that category amen
[46:30] being the female topping the church red
[46:32] the color had couldn't be spotted now
[46:34] and had to be a solid color and red
[46:36] always gives signifies redemption
[46:39] listen you say red always signifies
[46:41] danger it does to us in a red light but
[46:45] it's also redemption to do you know if
[46:47] there's not a red light there if you
[46:48] just keep driving through somebody
[46:49] t-bones you that's not redemption
[46:51] redemption is you stop and let the guy
[46:53] go by and then don't run it so red has
[46:57] always been the sign through the Bible
[46:59] remember the brothers preach the other
[47:01] night about Rahab did a wonderful job
[47:03] but he ever thought about that you were
[47:06] here brother
[47:07] that brother brought a wonderful job
[47:09] didn't know that we were talking about
[47:10] the about sanctification or the red
[47:14] blood but you take Rahab you and I
[47:22] everyone were Rahab every one of us I
[47:27] don't care if you were so pure no you
[47:30] were purely dead hey man if you were
[47:34] pure anything you were purely dead I
[47:36] like that I think I'll use that again
[47:37] you were purely dead but you take Rahab
[47:41] the harlot how in the world could you
[47:47] bring a lineage through a prostitute she
[47:55] knew a lot of men but she'd not met
[47:58] Salman yet and then when she did meet
[48:02] Salman she said hey Salman see you know
[48:05] I'm Rahab they called me the harlot he
[48:08] said I don't care what people call you
[48:10] he said what are you
[48:14] because he looks behind him and he looks
[48:16] out and he sees Jericho there's no walls
[48:22] there anymore but there's one little
[48:24] thing sticking up there's one remember
[48:27] their houses were against the wall
[48:29] Rahab's house wouldn't bother so there's
[48:31] one little there's one little piece
[48:33] sticking up and he sees a red string he
[48:40] didn't see nothing else he sees that red
[48:43] string hanging down and he said I don't
[48:46] see anything I don't see anything but
[48:49] red where's your accusers at Rahab
[48:54] she said the old dead
[48:59] he said well I don't see them and I
[49:02] didn't see you do it so let's get
[49:04] married
[49:07] amen amen
[49:08] [Applause]
[49:10] that's ask people we all carry baggage
[49:14] but without that red of that sanctifying
[49:17] blood to cover us were no match for the
[49:20] devil
[49:21] but brother Brown said one second in
[49:24] front of God and he'll annihilate us
[49:27] just like that
[49:28] why because remember this is not so this
[49:30] is not supposed to happen the first
[49:33] three dimensions of this world we live
[49:34] in
[49:35] and so I said I hope you see this you
[49:37] can't get a revelation in this dimension
[49:39] a true revelation from God has to come
[49:44] from that eternal dimension called the
[49:47] true revelation is eternal and that's
[49:51] what we're lacking folks we're lacking
[49:54] that eternal revelation that'll change
[49:57] our body amen redemption
[50:03] Jesus wisest they throw the girl down in
[50:06] front of him we caught her in the act
[50:11] I saw him I'm his neighbor I saw her I'm
[50:17] her I'm here I'm her neighbor yeah what
[50:19] Jesus do this Jesus would have seen that
[50:21] he'd had a killed her too but he got rid
[50:24] of her accusers who is I accuser
[50:27] one guy satan is our tutor but when God
[50:33] looks through read he sees white Amen he
[50:40] says all I see is the red brother Brown
[50:43] said that was what there was a red
[50:44] streak that went around the earth and he
[50:47] hears our voice Amen right that all
[50:53] right say Amen let's read number five
[50:58] back in the Old Testament they had a red
[50:59] heifer told Moses when they started this
[51:01] journey said now make a provision for
[51:03] the cleaning cleansiness spell that for
[51:07] the cleansiness of the people as they
[51:09] journeyed on for it they do do wrong
[51:12] they're out of fellowship now apply that
[51:14] to us cuz remember look let me go back
[51:18] to less compartmentalize your soul
[51:20] cannot lose eternal life your soul is
[51:24] just as eternal as God is it is God
[51:26] cannot sin will not sin doesn't have a
[51:30] bad day doesn't have one of those like
[51:32] my brother Nell said if you curse it
[51:35] didn't come from the inside no but you
[51:44] got that spirit realm that lives in this
[51:46] earth that you got to deal with that's
[51:49] what these are for us to kick that trash
[51:51] out but in the Old Testament that red
[51:54] heifer told Moses when they started the
[51:55] journey saying I'll make a provision for
[51:57] the cleansiness of the people as they
[51:58] journey on for if they do do wrong and
[52:01] you will I'll say that I'm interpolating
[52:04] there they're out of fellowship now this
[52:07] is under the blood of bulls and goats
[52:10] but there's a provision there and before
[52:15] they can fellowship I want you to make a
[52:16] water of separation then Moses commanded
[52:19] to take a red heifer a young heifer oh I
[52:21] want you to notice the word red means
[52:23] something to you and I read means danger
[52:26] but read in the Bible means redemption
[52:29] redemption through the blood all the way
[52:31] from Genesis to revelations you know
[52:35] everybody's worried about brother
[52:39] Branham you know he supposedly he was
[52:40] supposed to come out to jail
[52:41] surveil and preached the trail of the
[52:43] serpent I really don't care I really
[52:46] don't I can see it myself I don't need a
[52:51] prophet to tell me he told me what was
[52:53] wrong in Genesis but also he told me
[52:57] what was right from Genesis let us make
[53:00] man in our own image and after our
[53:02] likeness let him have dominion over the
[53:04] fish and see in the file there that man
[53:06] is living still today in you that is you
[53:13] that all right say ma'am that is you not
[53:19] a second person all right Matthew 12
[53:25] when the unclean spirits going out of a
[53:27] man we words like black he's not even
[53:30] here in the statement I run to my of the
[53:32] state member he was sitting here and I
[53:35] said when the unclean spirit goes out of
[53:37] a man I threw him over there across them
[53:38] and that's what happens now in your
[53:44] sanctification to come into the body of
[53:46] Christ that's sealed and filled up with
[53:49] God so you don't have to worry about
[53:51] that no more
[53:52] let's compartmentalize that we're not
[53:54] talking about sanctification to clean
[53:56] you and set aside for service for God to
[53:58] fill you with the Holy Ghost that's not
[53:59] we're talking about now we're up higher
[54:01] we're talking about our daily walk we're
[54:04] talking about this statue of a perfect
[54:06] man because Paul I mean Peter
[54:08] he said I'm talking to you that have the
[54:10] divine nature of God brother Dale read
[54:13] it this morning now if you got the
[54:15] divine nature of God where's the problem
[54:18] 9 your soul it's in your spirit realm
[54:22] thank God in Ephesians that the word is
[54:26] a divider send us a prophet to divide
[54:29] the soul in the spirit you know it
[54:32] doesn't say anything about the flesh see
[54:37] we're worried about this thing we set to
[54:40] sermon after sermon after sermon of
[54:43] beating this guy to death you get the
[54:51] Holy Ghost inside him
[54:53] sure you're still gonna have problems
[54:55] but brother Brown said you can't get a
[54:58] Holy Ghost field woman to put on a pair
[54:59] of pants you can't get a Holy Ghost
[55:01] field woman to cut her hair so point
[55:04] made point taken
[55:06] you still wearing pants sisters I don't
[55:09] condemn you you ain't got the whole ego
[55:15] you cut your hair
[55:17] that means trimming you don't have a
[55:21] holla go point mate
[55:23] point taken so I don't have to preach
[55:25] about it no more we heard sermons and
[55:27] sermons trying to get this thing lined
[55:29] up forget it folks right mark
[55:34] really he works outlook but it's like me
[55:43] they go more this way now than it does
[55:44] this way why because that's the fall
[55:49] that we live in that ain't got nothing
[55:51] to do with the man the person amen so
[55:57] our problem is is were what did Jesus
[56:00] say he said don't worry what you eat
[56:02] goes out to draw right he said but from
[56:06] the heart proceedeth from the heart
[56:10] proceedeth all things in other words
[56:11] they meant mmm so where was I
[56:16] Matthew when the unclean spirit is going
[56:18] out of man walks through Dry places
[56:19] seeking rest - no you say do you have
[56:21] unclean spirit yes I have unclean spirit
[56:25] they just don't reside where they used
[56:28] to reside
[56:29] they found another place remember
[56:32] brother Branham preached doors in doors
[56:36] when you get the Holy Ghost you let God
[56:40] in your house but you don't let him in
[56:44] that door right there because you don't
[56:47] want him to see your dirty laundry you
[56:50] don't want him in that door but now I'll
[56:51] open this door that's easy but I won't
[56:54] open that one that's what he preached
[56:56] and Lissa's the Holy Ghost is a
[56:58] gentleman you know the Holy Ghost if I
[56:59] was the Holy Ghost boy thank God I'm not
[57:01] he go let me in that door
[57:05] amen that's what we try to do we try to
[57:09] convert people by kicking the door down
[57:12] but when the sweetness of God comes you
[57:15] thank God I got things behind this door
[57:18] that I want you to take care of amen and
[57:23] the people out there think we're leaving
[57:25] but that's what it is that's how easy it
[57:28] is though you open the door and he said
[57:30] okay I'll help you okay I'll help you
[57:34] amen that's what I'm talking about
[57:37] that's the seal the second seal to me is
[57:39] that you let God in all those doors and
[57:42] there's nothing to hinder what he's
[57:46] willing to do from the inside out
[57:49] [Music]
[57:51] hey he's already in there he just wants
[57:57] to work he wants full fellowship done
[58:03] alright we'll get to a little bit more
[58:08] I'm gonna skip something if I'm gonna go
[58:09] to the last part here and then we'll
[58:10] close give everybody time to get out I
[58:13] went through this I want you to just
[58:15] listen to me for a minute then we're
[58:16] gonna read it if you will go to first
[58:23] Peter 1:22
[58:25] or brother Dale read this morning you'll
[58:29] have to skip a bunch and get down to
[58:31] where brother Adam talks on the time of
[58:33] decision but listen they'll find it in a
[58:37] minute
[58:38] I think Nate's back there wake up Nate I
[58:43] like it when these people learn listen
[58:45] well we got people that leave and go
[58:47] tile of to have diversity that people
[58:50] can go back there and help out and this
[58:51] one can go teach son just go man we
[58:54] didn't have it when we first wouldn't
[58:55] come to church here daddy was the
[58:56] preacher song leader if he could have
[58:58] played the piano he would and he can't
[59:01] play guitar he must not be a message
[59:03] preacher he ain't been in jail he ain't
[59:05] picked the guitar he can't play a piano
[59:06] and he can't sing me too
[59:11] [Music]
[59:15] maybe I woke some of you up a little bit
[59:17] all right look so let's finish this
[59:21] let's not finish it but let's bring it
[59:23] to a point I want you to watch this
[59:25] point because remember the property God
[59:29] preached the token now the token is why
[59:32] what was this what was the example of
[59:35] the token in the Old Testament the man
[59:39] of the house went and killed the lamb
[59:43] took the blood and went over the
[59:47] doorpost now when the Death Angel came
[59:49] by he couldn't go in that door because
[59:53] he was what he was shielded by the blood
[59:58] now I like that that's ok but let's
[1:00:05] reach in the womb of our mind and turn
[1:00:06] to just a little bit I don't want the
[1:00:10] token over my door he didn't save him
[1:00:16] people inside did it but if I never get
[1:00:21] the token inside put that token inside
[1:00:25] that's why so sure we pray for our
[1:00:27] children we pray for Kidron pray for my
[1:00:29] children but you know what I say God you
[1:00:36] go get them forget about the building
[1:00:39] forget about the car they're driving
[1:00:42] this is the building I'm worried about
[1:00:44] right here I want the token on display
[1:00:48] not over my door I want the token on
[1:00:52] display here see so maybe they'll change
[1:00:55] her our thinking a little bit because
[1:00:58] watch you say brother we'll have no
[1:01:02] authority to do that here we go - can't
[1:01:07] cut in the wooden again listen we got
[1:01:11] become believers in what God's already
[1:01:13] said believers in what God's already
[1:01:16] saying I'm not telling you one thing you
[1:01:19] probably never heard before
[1:01:21] ok if I did then you know what God's
[1:01:23] bringing something to your memory
[1:01:25] watch this seeing you purified your
[1:01:28] souls I'm seeing you what purified your
[1:01:31] souls in obeying the truth through the
[1:01:32] spirit and unfailing love of the
[1:01:33] Brethren see that you love one another a
[1:01:35] pure heart fervently being born again
[1:01:38] not of corruptible seed so not mama not
[1:01:43] daddy but of incorruptible by the Word
[1:01:51] of God which is the incorruptible seed
[1:01:55] which liveth into by the forever look
[1:01:57] for all the flashes there's grass and
[1:01:59] all the glory of man as the flower of
[1:02:00] grass flesh flesh flesh the grass
[1:02:08] withereth look the grass withereth
[1:02:14] unless you have one of these daddy told
[1:02:20] his 80 year old sister one time said if
[1:02:22] you have one more facelift said your
[1:02:23] belly button is gonna be right here but
[1:02:28] you know what that's just propping it up
[1:02:30] she's laying in the grave now sorry
[1:02:33] that's just propping up the flash get
[1:02:36] the inside man listen that inside person
[1:02:40] has no wrinkles that insight lessen that
[1:02:43] inside person is no more dead than
[1:02:47] anything it's alive that Genesis 1:26
[1:02:53] man has never got one second old from
[1:02:56] the day God said it we're still in the
[1:03:00] day of God for all flesh is grass the
[1:03:06] grass withers and flower therefore but
[1:03:07] what but the Word of God the word of the
[1:03:10] Lord endureth forever and this is the
[1:03:15] word which by the gospel is preached
[1:03:18] unto you
[1:03:20] now I'm gonna declare something to you
[1:03:22] today that the prophet of God is already
[1:03:24] declared but I'm gonna read what he said
[1:03:25] all right time at decision 1959 now this
[1:03:31] is 1959 before the seals broke but watch
[1:03:36] what he says
[1:03:38] go to the next quote but wonder why that
[1:03:44] Rebecca came before any other girl just
[1:03:46] I might Rebecca nothing did you know
[1:03:48] that Rebecca and Isaac was blood
[1:03:50] relation cousins and the bride of Jesus
[1:03:57] Christ his blood relation to him a
[1:04:05] blood-bought bride no wonder she was led
[1:04:09] by the spirit there was a connection
[1:04:12] coming together there was a union coming
[1:04:16] together that's the reason I think today
[1:04:18] that the born-again the the Holy Ghost
[1:04:22] filled people is connected with God and
[1:04:25] are led by the Spirit of God that's why
[1:04:27] they act so peculiar to the people
[1:04:29] they've made their decisions remember
[1:04:33] sanctification is the decision you make
[1:04:34] you can't justify yourself but you can
[1:04:39] come under sanctification which is
[1:04:40] cleaning and set aside for service all
[1:04:43] right so it's something that you do
[1:04:44] they're going to go they made their
[1:04:47] decisions they're going to go on out
[1:04:48] regardless that the rest of them don't
[1:04:50] go out they're going anyway I like that
[1:04:52] don't care if this one walks or that one
[1:04:54] walks I'm going to walk anyway don't
[1:04:56] care where the one in other words look
[1:04:58] the life is in the blood and the life is
[1:05:01] in the church the Christian that's born
[1:05:06] again by the Spirit of God that's the
[1:05:08] spirit of life blood relation to Christ
[1:05:15] the Spirit of Christ in the blood of
[1:05:18] Christ leading a child of Christ the
[1:05:21] seed of Abraham that's why they move
[1:05:24] accurately that's why the world thinks
[1:05:27] so that's why the world thinks strange
[1:05:29] of us we say I'm not gonna die go tell
[1:05:32] somebody you're not gonna die Betsy some
[1:05:36] of you older ones go tell somebody you
[1:05:37] ain't gonna die oh really okay well
[1:05:41] that's fine
[1:05:42] here you know what that's gonna happen
[1:05:45] folks it's going to happen
[1:05:48] I'm just dumb enough to believe it's me
[1:05:50] let's go the next when crisis the
[1:05:52] mystery of God reveal now notice now
[1:05:55] here is after the seals broke he said if
[1:05:57] you don't get the seals right
[1:05:59] he said come back to this message right
[1:06:01] here Christ is the mystery of God
[1:06:03] revealed preached several months after
[1:06:06] the seals watch what he says now making
[1:06:08] it known how ma there's just so much
[1:06:09] here we could just keep on going notice
[1:06:11] the tree of Christ's body in the garden
[1:06:14] making now making his mystery known to
[1:06:16] this bride tree watch redeemed by Christ
[1:06:19] the second Adam you believe he was
[1:06:21] congregation says they men going back
[1:06:24] home to Eden with his fallen wife his
[1:06:27] Rahab is fallen wife
[1:06:32] that's Christ in the church today taking
[1:06:37] his wife back you see we're not talking
[1:06:42] about sanctification cleaning set aside
[1:06:43] for service we're talking about so
[1:06:45] sanctified you didn't do it now listen
[1:06:48] grace doesn't mean you got away with
[1:06:50] something you did it
[1:06:52] you know you did it but there is a
[1:06:54] change coming to where we're gonna have
[1:06:56] to believe that God knows it doesn't
[1:06:58] happen God knows it didn't happen he
[1:07:01] said what sins you talking about because
[1:07:04] remember if he can remember your sin he
[1:07:06] can take you to judgment come on people
[1:07:10] if he can remember one sin you have he
[1:07:13] can take you to judgment and say you
[1:07:15] didn't do what I said that's why I tell
[1:07:18] you the greatest revelation I ever had
[1:07:21] other than being born again was that I
[1:07:24] don't have to stand before the judgment
[1:07:26] my prophet told me and I can look in the
[1:07:29] Bible and see it now then I don't have
[1:07:32] to stand judgment he stood judgment for
[1:07:36] me and if he's sinless if he is virtuous
[1:07:40] if he is God Almighty what does that
[1:07:44] mean me
[1:07:46] what does that make me because remember
[1:07:49] a judgment we don't stand like this
[1:07:51] because it takes two people one to judge
[1:07:54] and wanted to be judged right but we're
[1:07:58] him made manifest in another form called
[1:08:00] a variety doesn't matter how many
[1:08:01] standing behind him there today of
[1:08:03] judgment we are judging the world cross
[1:08:08] manifesting in the church all together
[1:08:10] to bring back the original Adam and Eve
[1:08:12] again this is not in heaven Adam and Eve
[1:08:18] didn't reside in heaven they resided on
[1:08:22] earth which are one made out of the same
[1:08:25] blood same spirit and everything else
[1:08:27] goes remember Adam and Eve literally
[1:08:28] were one person same DNA same blood same
[1:08:33] everything it drive a chemist crazy if
[1:08:35] they were to take both blood sample
[1:08:37] right but now watch the church is the
[1:08:41] blood of Christ by the spirit because
[1:08:46] the life is in the blood
[1:08:48] that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:08:50] that baptizes us into his body that
[1:08:53] recognizes only his body his flesh his
[1:08:58] word that all right say ma'am I like
[1:09:02] that now let's go to the next one last
[1:09:07] one and then we I don't have to read the
[1:09:10] one where brother Brown says you're
[1:09:11] you're not saved by the blood right
[1:09:12] you're kept saved by the blood the
[1:09:14] sanctifying condition alright now watch
[1:09:16] the token this last one then we'll stand
[1:09:19] water blood and spirit come when the
[1:09:22] mother gives birth to the baby
[1:09:23] the first thing breaks a normal birth is
[1:09:25] water the second thing is blood and next
[1:09:27] thing is life there come from the body
[1:09:29] of our Lord Jesus water blood life and
[1:09:31] the whole church the bride together has
[1:09:34] been made up through justification I
[1:09:36] want this church I want y'all to know
[1:09:37] one thing I want the world to know I
[1:09:40] believe in sin killing salvation through
[1:09:44] justification sanctification in the
[1:09:46] baptismal oligo you know why because I'm
[1:09:49] put it all in the Bible I put it all in
[1:09:51] the prophets message and I don't have to
[1:09:52] deny nothing amen what we get justified
[1:09:57] for if we've already had this eternal
[1:09:58] something
[1:10:00] we were eternal in the word people we
[1:10:02] were darling the word is the seed I
[1:10:08] think we forget where we came from which
[1:10:14] is the token as Hebrews 11 said all
[1:10:16] these who wandered about in CC and
[1:10:18] goatskin they were destitute all these
[1:10:20] things they'd done yet was not made
[1:10:21] perfect without us you got that
[1:10:24] listen to me I'm telling you they
[1:10:27] without us
[1:10:27] I don't need Hebrews 11:40 I know this
[1:10:30] for a fact they without us cannot be
[1:10:34] made perfect and if hold on a minute I
[1:10:38] thought they were in another dimension
[1:10:41] and they were perfect I'm so much a born
[1:10:48] again
[1:10:49] they're not gonna be perfected without
[1:10:51] us you see what we got to have on this
[1:10:54] side it's more than just a perfection of
[1:10:56] the soul anybody in the sixth dimension
[1:11:00] folks anybody from the first church age
[1:11:01] all the way up that's in the sixth
[1:11:03] dimension they're just as eternal as God
[1:11:04] is amen waiting us to come to a place to
[1:11:11] believe what God's already said bring
[1:11:13] them out of the ground to connect back
[1:11:15] with their body let's be changed
[1:11:18] I think I'm reading scripture if you
[1:11:19] don't believe that or not that's to be
[1:11:23] changed and then we're all to just step
[1:11:24] over into another dimension and let God
[1:11:26] well not let God actually really man's
[1:11:29] gonna destroy itself
[1:11:30] man's gonna destroy itself no other
[1:11:32] reason it the only reason that Hawaii is
[1:11:34] not sunk is because of me and you the
[1:11:37] only reason California hadn't sunk us me
[1:11:38] and you but when we leave this place
[1:11:42] pardon my expression all hell's gonna
[1:11:44] break loose because we livin in hell
[1:11:46] anyway this is Satan's Eden I really
[1:11:50] love it
[1:11:51] Satan came down into God's Eden and
[1:11:54] messed it up now God has turned around
[1:11:57] and went right down into Satan's eating
[1:11:59] and he's messed it up
[1:12:00] thank God for that and he's doing it
[1:12:03] through what no book not a quote through
[1:12:05] you and the church in this day that's
[1:12:08] received the token of the baptism of the
[1:12:11] Holy Ghost that the
[1:12:13] blood has been shedding that the holy
[1:12:14] ghost is upon the church without us then
[1:12:18] they cannot raise but they're depending
[1:12:24] on us for God promised he would have it
[1:12:29] and somebody is going to be there I am
[1:12:33] that person y'all or not okay you decide
[1:12:39] if you want to I don't know who it's
[1:12:44] going to be but somebody is going to
[1:12:47] receive it the only one thing I'm
[1:12:50] responsible is to preach it and he did a
[1:12:52] wonderful job amen now he's give it to
[1:12:56] all of us so that we can break it down
[1:12:59] so that you guys can understand it's you
