[6:31] revelations
[6:34] 1-3
[6:37] the revelation of jesus christ which god
[6:39] gave unto him to show unto his servants
[6:42] things which must shortly come to pass
[6:44] and he sent and signified it by his
[6:46] angel and to his servant john
[6:48] that by a record of the word of god and
[6:50] the testimony of jesus christ and of all
[6:52] things that he saw
[6:54] blessed is he that readeth and they that
[6:56] hear the words of this prophecy
[6:58] and keep those things which are written
[7:00] therein for the time is at hand you may
[7:04] be seated the lord
[7:05] and his blessing to the reading of the
[7:07] word remember we covered the time is at
[7:09] hand
[7:10] there never was a time
[7:13] for this book of revelations to be
[7:15] understood until this end time that's
[7:18] right all right so now it's here and you
[7:21] know time for us to understand
[7:23] and to walk there in and
[7:25] to see
[7:26] you know the light of the
[7:29] level god made manifest to his little
[7:30] bride
[7:32] by revealing himself now
[7:35] we covered this past wednesday night
[7:38] as we read so we'll turn over and read
[7:40] revelations 4 1
[7:42] and we started covering the open door
[7:45] and what john saw this is a kind of a
[7:48] study on the book of revelations
[7:51] not doing it in depth like we did back
[7:53] years ago
[7:55] but trying to skip over some things and
[7:58] just pick up some points
[8:00] and getting down into
[8:02] revelations chapter 5.
[8:04] all right so you know we'll go to
[8:06] revelation 4 1
[8:08] and just
[8:10] look at the scripture there and see what
[8:11] it says
[8:14] all right so it says after this i looked
[8:18] and behold a door was opened in heaven
[8:21] the first voice which i heard was as it
[8:23] were of a trumpet talking with me which
[8:25] said come up hither and i will show the
[8:29] things which must be
[8:32] here after and we'll go ahead and read
[8:34] verse 2 because that'll get into our
[8:36] message part and immediately i was in
[8:38] the spirit and behold a throne was set
[8:40] in heaven
[8:41] and one set on the throne
[8:44] you know we appreciate the brothers
[8:46] running those things up now
[8:49] the open door you remember how we
[8:51] covered it you remember jesus said in
[8:53] john 10 said i am the door of the sheep
[8:56] he didn't say just that i'm the door of
[8:58] the cheap fold or something that's fine
[9:00] because all that tops out and all but he
[9:02] said i am the door
[9:05] of the sheep
[9:07] because that's who we are you know we
[9:08] are his we are his sheep
[9:11] and and we we thank god that he's made
[9:13] us to be that but we covered the open
[9:15] door
[9:16] and speaking on it and we'll go back and
[9:18] pick up a little bit in a minute to see
[9:20] that
[9:21] but remember the scene was on earth
[9:25] in chapter one of revelations
[9:28] and he saw you know the things of
[9:30] revelations one i saw one standing in
[9:33] the midst of the gulf seven golden
[9:34] candlesticks like unto the son of man
[9:37] uh gerd about the paps we covered that
[9:39] as showing the
[9:41] feminist part of the you know being the
[9:43] bride of christ
[9:45] and it's like i've told you
[9:47] the book of revelations to me is the
[9:49] greatest book of all the books after
[9:51] we've become to a point of understanding
[9:54] because in the book of revelations you
[9:57] never find jesus just by himself
[10:00] standing somewhere or something he's
[10:02] always in the bride
[10:05] or revealing himself to the bride is
[10:07] standing there with her or basically in
[10:10] her it's it's it's the greatest book and
[10:12] i've always said if i had to just take
[10:14] one one uh book i could take you know
[10:17] out of the bible i would take the book
[10:18] of revelation
[10:20] now because we understand it we were
[10:22] first told we couldn't understand it now
[10:24] we see it so simple
[10:26] a child can understand
[10:28] because you know you're not looking for
[10:30] some kind of a a physical door to be cut
[10:32] in heaven you know and john looks up and
[10:35] oh there's a door you know
[10:37] you know it's probably lost you know no
[10:41] we're not trying to do that we we're
[10:43] trying to look and see what these things
[10:44] mean and by way of the prophet's message
[10:48] expounding unto us
[10:50] the the symbolics of the book of
[10:52] revelations then we'll have any trouble
[10:54] with understanding it we just read it
[10:56] and believe it and see what it's talking
[10:58] about
[11:00] but see we look at as i said jesus would
[11:02] say i am the door of the sheep
[11:05] he was expressing himself back there for
[11:08] what he was
[11:09] and then that's what we were trying to
[11:10] cover wednesday that we'll read in just
[11:13] a minute again where john saw
[11:15] jesus
[11:16] and that's what he saw
[11:18] he didn't look up and see those are
[11:20] symbolics a door was just a symbol
[11:24] right
[11:25] see that was just a symbol that wasn't a
[11:27] door up there it was a person that he
[11:30] saw
[11:31] all right now we'll get to that in a
[11:32] minute but what i want you to see is is
[11:35] go ahead brother and pull up these
[11:36] scriptures i want you to see that there
[11:39] there has been it has been spoken of
[11:41] before
[11:43] about
[11:44] heaven being opened
[11:46] and people being able to see
[11:49] and the things that we're seeing there
[11:50] and you'll think well well you know did
[11:52] he look at the door
[11:54] and see the door and jesus standing in
[11:56] the door now he saw the door and he knew
[11:58] that was jesus
[12:00] all right so now we go back in the old
[12:02] testament we pick up genesis
[12:04] where the jacob watched what he saw
[12:07] and he lied upon a certified they
[12:08] centered verse chapter genesis 28 11-13
[12:13] because the sun was set and he took the
[12:15] stones of that place and put them for
[12:17] pillars and lay down in that place to
[12:19] sleep and what and he dreamed and behold
[12:22] a ladder set
[12:23] up on the earth and watch it's on the
[12:26] earth
[12:27] i love it that way
[12:28] because we're down here all right
[12:31] and the top of it reached to heaven
[12:34] all right now watch
[12:36] and behold the angels of god ascending
[12:38] and descending now look at that away
[12:40] ascending and descending
[12:43] see we think the angels were descending
[12:45] and ascending
[12:47] now see watch what it says these are the
[12:49] angels of god ascending from where jacob
[12:52] was
[12:54] there wasn't up there coming down
[12:56] they were down here with jacob and you
[12:58] know because i don't angels in hell is
[13:00] wonderful that's all right i want him
[13:03] down here you know
[13:04] i need help down here i get to have my
[13:06] life to worry about that
[13:08] but what and behold the lord stood above
[13:11] it
[13:12] and said i am the lord god of abraham
[13:16] lord god of abraham thy father and the
[13:18] god of isaac
[13:19] now watch in the land where he forgives
[13:21] book and our point is what
[13:24] he looks up
[13:26] the dream and what does he see
[13:28] he sees the lord standing at the top of
[13:30] the ladder right
[13:32] john saw jesus
[13:34] amen
[13:36] jacob saw
[13:38] a ladder
[13:40] reaching from earth to heaven
[13:43] and angels
[13:44] going from jacob which was taking his
[13:47] prayers and that's what it does for me
[13:48] and you see the angels of god take your
[13:51] prayers and carry them up
[13:54] all right then bring back
[13:57] the rewards to you like the revelation
[13:59] of the word the things the healings or
[14:01] whatever and see i like it that way it's
[14:04] not it's not descending and that's
[14:05] anything it's totally different right
[14:07] all right we'll go now to the book of
[14:09] acts and let's see it again
[14:11] all right so in acts now
[14:14] this is stephen what and when they heard
[14:17] these things they were
[14:18] cut to the heart and they niced on him
[14:20] with their teeth but he being full of
[14:22] the holy ghost looked up steadfastly
[14:24] into heaven
[14:26] and saw the glory of god and jesus
[14:29] standing on the right hand
[14:31] of god and said behold i see the heavens
[14:34] open
[14:35] and the son of man standing on the right
[14:37] hand of god see he's giving you
[14:40] two
[14:41] situations in the bible that we could
[14:43] spend a dra amount you know large amount
[14:46] of time speaking on
[14:48] that
[14:49] what these see
[14:51] it was a symbolics back there and still
[14:54] symbolics now but i hope you notice in
[14:56] genesis that it did use the capital lord
[15:02] god himself
[15:03] standing at the head of the latter you
[15:05] know welcoming you and i all right now
[15:09] then but let's get down to the point and
[15:10] just review we're still on the review
[15:12] for just a little bit a couple of quotes
[15:14] i want you to keep these so go ahead to
[15:16] quote number three
[15:17] i want you to read these and think about
[15:19] it
[15:21] this is revelation chapter four
[15:24] part one of it 1960 12 31
[15:27] this door said in heaven
[15:29] that door now once that door when he
[15:31] looked up he saw the lord jesus
[15:35] but john didn't look up and see a door
[15:37] he did now get it right now listen to me
[15:39] let's see follow me he saw a door but
[15:42] immediately the understanding to john
[15:45] was
[15:46] that's
[15:48] right
[15:49] john was there to get these symbolics
[15:51] and break them down to you and i so sure
[15:53] he saw a door
[15:55] just like jacob saw a ladder in his
[15:57] dream
[15:59] and he saw god standing at the top of
[16:01] the ladder
[16:03] all right now the latter is the lord
[16:04] jesus because the only way to get to
[16:06] heaven
[16:06] is to jesus christ see that's why we
[16:08] could spend some drastic amount of time
[16:10] on each one of those things and stephen
[16:13] he saw the heavens opened
[16:16] but he saw jesus
[16:18] standing at the right hand of the father
[16:20] where and the throne we'll get to this
[16:22] afternoon
[16:24] all right and when we get to that point
[16:26] then we'll see what it is well look what
[16:27] he saw
[16:29] now notice what he said now the scene is
[16:31] changing
[16:32] john's been watching patmos
[16:34] what was on earth and going on you know
[16:36] and telling him the times the church
[16:37] ages and the you know the revelations
[16:40] one and then revelation two and three
[16:42] church ages
[16:43] now the scene is changing john's been
[16:45] watching fatma's
[16:46] and now he looks up fine he sees
[16:48] something went on on earth here the
[16:50] church ages
[16:52] all down to the seven church ages
[16:54] and then after he got through seeing the
[16:56] church ages
[16:57] after that after the church ages had
[17:00] ceased
[17:01] he heard a voice and he looked up
[17:03] towards heaven and he seen an open door
[17:05] and the first voice sounded like a
[17:07] trumpet all right scene changed from
[17:09] patmos to heaven i remember we covered
[17:12] the voice
[17:14] and the person is the same right so when
[17:17] john heard the voice
[17:20] as he did in revelations 1 he turns to
[17:23] see the voice
[17:25] but he sees seven golden candlesticks he
[17:27] sees it symbolic but what did he see
[17:29] jesus christ he turned to see the one
[17:31] that had spoke to him on earth
[17:35] and that's what's happening here in
[17:36] revelations 4 that's right
[17:39] things are going to be made known and
[17:41] revealed but first you've got to see
[17:43] jesus
[17:45] all right you say i see the bride well
[17:47] it's good but you remember you can only
[17:50] see
[17:51] the bride by seeing jesus christ
[17:53] see then it'll come forth that you'll
[17:55] see really what it's all about then
[17:57] you'll see jesus because he is that is
[17:59] who she is all right now watch the next
[18:02] one then
[18:04] all right
[18:05] this is revelation chapter four part one
[18:07] the same
[18:08] message
[18:10] now he after the church edge was over
[18:12] and everything was come ready
[18:14] made ready the setting of the fourth
[18:16] chapter here the church ages was done
[18:19] he had done left the earth you see
[18:21] remember the voice that fight spoke to
[18:23] him
[18:24] behind him in the seven golden
[18:26] candlesticks now that's chapter one
[18:27] right right
[18:29] that's where he saw it and he heard the
[18:30] voice and he turns the sea of his head
[18:32] and he turns to see this he's selling
[18:34] the old candlestick but he knows the
[18:36] voice
[18:37] the voice is the one that he talked to
[18:38] on earth that he sat down and ate with
[18:41] and fellowship with the lord jesus
[18:43] christ all right
[18:45] and now that same voice was speaking up
[18:47] in heaven
[18:48] what was it he had done redeemed his
[18:50] people his earthly work was finished and
[18:52] he was in glory calling to john come up
[18:54] hither uh um amen that makes me feel
[18:57] like shouting
[18:59] all through the new year now remember
[19:00] what we covered in the voice they
[19:02] brought around and said to charlie cox
[19:04] you know he said brother charlie the one
[19:06] that told called you and told you to
[19:08] turn around
[19:11] will one day call you until you come up
[19:14] just not a different voice
[19:16] the one that spoke to you about your
[19:17] salvation right the one that calls you
[19:20] is the same what it's going to call us
[19:22] up
[19:23] not two or three different holy ghosts
[19:24] and you know and all kind of things to
[19:27] get into man's mind and you know
[19:28] trinities and
[19:30] points like that
[19:32] but now
[19:34] here's what i want you to get today
[19:38] i know it's going to take a little bit
[19:39] of understanding
[19:41] in your mind to comprehend
[19:44] the things
[19:46] because you're so used to being
[19:49] this way this way this way
[19:51] so you might want to change from this
[19:53] way to that way
[19:54] and that was him
[19:56] you know he said i'm the way the truth
[19:57] of the life right
[19:58] now
[19:59] but see by our teachings and our
[20:01] thoughts in our minds and are trying to
[20:04] comprehend everything by the natural
[20:08] we get into trouble
[20:10] all right see that's why we've always
[20:12] been taught to stay away from the book
[20:14] of revelation
[20:15] because we tried to understand those
[20:18] things
[20:19] naturally
[20:21] now some of the people like schofield
[20:23] and the different ones
[20:25] they went into some things and began to
[20:27] see things and thank god for it there
[20:30] was people down through time that had
[20:31] truth
[20:33] but we're in the end time where the
[20:35] truth is
[20:36] the prophet's message has been brought
[20:38] to us and if we need to have an
[20:40] understanding we just go ask him what
[20:42] it's all about right yeah he said well
[20:45] he ain't here to ask him see there's one
[20:46] of those natural points in your mind he
[20:48] ain't here now to ask you we got the
[20:50] books and the tapes the computers to run
[20:52] it off right
[20:54] the way these notes right here
[20:56] years ago when i preached this probably
[20:58] the first time back about 40 years ago
[21:02] it took me weeks and weeks to find these
[21:04] you know to search out through the
[21:06] message listen to tapes
[21:08] and write down the quotes now we can
[21:10] just go over the computer
[21:12] and instantly we've got the quotes and a
[21:14] whole lot more than what we used to have
[21:16] and that's why i've always said you know
[21:18] everybody wants my bible because i wrote
[21:21] i used to write my own concordance
[21:24] if you don't know something on the
[21:25] godhead i can just turn it here and tell
[21:26] you you will know what the third pull
[21:28] i'm just turning here and tell you
[21:29] because that's where i write them down
[21:31] all right now but the point is now we're
[21:34] showing where we can just get it in a
[21:36] hurry and understand right
[21:38] now
[21:39] but my point this this morning is one
[21:41] thing
[21:44] the bride will go up in revelations 4 1.
[21:49] all right that's right yes
[21:51] now listen real carefully because we're
[21:53] going to give the prophets quotes to
[21:55] these like in the seal book like in
[21:57] feast of the trumpets and others
[22:01] and the bride the prophet said is not
[22:02] seen from revelation 4 1
[22:05] to 1921.
[22:06] now you got to remember
[22:09] what he's saying
[22:11] she's not seen on earth
[22:14] because she's definitely seen
[22:16] in revelations 4
[22:18] right
[22:20] because she goes up that's right
[22:22] john is the type
[22:24] she's definitely seen in revelations 5
[22:27] yep
[22:29] because we're priests and kings and et
[22:30] cetera you know
[22:32] all right so then don't just
[22:35] see when you hear a prophet say
[22:36] something you got to be able to
[22:40] listen carefully what he's saying amen
[22:43] because you take that cell the church is
[22:45] saying no more come well then you go in
[22:48] the book of revelation and read it you
[22:49] you know right so that's not the way
[22:51] that we're trying to approach it we try
[22:54] to approach it by revelation
[22:56] to understand what's being said
[22:59] and sometimes it takes that like i told
[23:01] you that brother motor i remember him
[23:03] telling me see when they were just
[23:04] hearing the tights and going to the
[23:06] tabernacle
[23:07] and like brother brown said adam and eve
[23:10] went out of the garden you see
[23:13] to them that just meant it was out it
[23:16] was gone you know
[23:17] and said it may be months or whatever
[23:20] before the prophet would preach another
[23:21] sermon that they could get a hold of and
[23:23] would run around would say but see they
[23:25] had a lamb before they went out right
[23:27] well see then you can get into a lot of
[23:30] trouble by not having
[23:31] the the ability to search out
[23:34] and see what the prophet is saying so
[23:36] just like i said there the prophet will
[23:38] say the bride is not saved
[23:40] no more well she's not seen on earth
[23:43] that's right
[23:44] but she can be seen in heaven
[23:47] but not like we're thinking
[23:50] now here's the problem
[23:52] and i've tried to express this for many
[23:54] many over 40 years
[23:58] you say the bride goes up in revelation
[24:00] 4 1 and
[24:01] not seen until 1921 when she writes back
[24:05] but brother table
[24:07] revelation 10 7
[24:10] are you saying that that's not brother
[24:11] branham
[24:13] no i'm not saying that right
[24:17] i'm not saying that
[24:19] i'm saying it's placed in order amen yes
[24:21] yes
[24:23] but brother dale where it says in
[24:24] revelation 18 4 come out of here my
[24:27] people
[24:28] if you're not saying that's the bride
[24:30] coming out no i'm not saying that right
[24:35] but now are you going to listen to what
[24:37] the prophet had to say
[24:39] are you going to take your own
[24:40] interpretation that's right
[24:43] so if he says the bride goes up in 4-1
[24:45] and not single 1921 then don't try to
[24:47] see her on earth amen right
[24:50] right well she's already in heaven and
[24:51] earthling
[24:53] right right
[24:54] that truth
[24:55] so what goes on on earth is no concern
[24:57] to the bride the seals right
[25:00] i tried to preach that in in 1979
[25:03] started from there on up especially 82
[25:05] and 83
[25:06] that were that that we talk about the
[25:08] seals oh yes we understand the seals the
[25:10] white horse riders
[25:12] antichrist well clarence larkin said
[25:15] that before brother brown did
[25:19] did that make it right
[25:21] no
[25:22] because he didn't have the revelation
[25:24] he had a partial understanding
[25:29] because he was still riding on the same
[25:30] white horse
[25:34] but you see the seals have nothing to do
[25:36] with the bride
[25:37] right there to israel that's correct
[25:39] amen
[25:42] the revelation of the seals is what has
[25:45] to do to you and i thank god
[25:47] all right
[25:49] because the seals show it we'll read the
[25:50] quote from the end where the seals show
[25:52] what it was what is and what will be all
[25:56] right
[25:57] so the complete plan of redemption is
[25:59] shown in the seven seals
[26:02] but the actual opening of the seals is
[26:04] to israel they asked brother brown
[26:08] on the questions and answers
[26:10] says does
[26:12] uh the man of sin sitting in the temple
[26:14] of god showing himself to be as god he
[26:15] says that the first seal he says yes
[26:17] right amen well we better not be around
[26:19] here when the man of sin
[26:21] is revealed that's sitting in the temple
[26:23] of god we know who he is why we've been
[26:26] told the story we know the end of the
[26:28] book right
[26:30] we know who john and mary is but we know
[26:33] the happily ever after living right
[26:36] that's right it's like i said there the
[26:39] other day
[26:40] god said to abraham said can i withhold
[26:43] anything that's right amen seeing that
[26:45] he's the heir of all times
[26:48] and you just get old up and give him a
[26:50] layout
[26:51] he said well what you give to him you
[26:53] get him all the way down to chains of
[26:54] the body right the man
[26:57] come on he made him a young man
[27:00] see so he showed him the whole plan of
[27:02] redemption
[27:04] all right
[27:05] we see that way that we have to follow
[27:07] it
[27:08] you say yeah but i've always been taught
[27:10] the seals to the bride the revelation is
[27:13] to the bride
[27:14] yeah go now listen
[27:16] i gotta cover a few things this morning
[27:18] to get them out of the way
[27:23] the white horse rider is the antichrist
[27:25] right
[27:26] right
[27:27] that's not the seal
[27:29] that's right
[27:31] sorry
[27:32] that's what you see when the seal is
[27:34] broken
[27:36] amen the seal is the holy spirit come on
[27:39] get in the bible
[27:41] ephesians 4 30 great not the holy spirit
[27:43] whereby you're single
[27:44] see we say we understand the seals the
[27:46] seals
[27:47] is a revelation of jesus christ
[27:52] then when you see jesus christ reveal
[27:54] you automatically see these other things
[27:57] go to the first seal
[28:00] and read it
[28:02] notice where brother around and said my
[28:04] revelation
[28:05] is that god and jesus and the holy ghost
[28:08] is the seventh same person amen right he
[28:10] said thy ghost nobody was right
[28:13] thereby
[28:14] that guy that fellow going that way
[28:17] is the antichrist
[28:19] now that's trinitarians it didn't matter
[28:20] how many people we had running all over
[28:22] the place right
[28:24] you see where we can't comprehend it
[28:26] with a trinity that's right right
[28:28] we're gonna have a guy running this way
[28:29] to god running that way to god run look
[28:31] at that there's god revealed
[28:33] great big bunch of grace
[28:36] well we thought we had it
[28:38] then i'd like for you to get it out of
[28:40] your mind
[28:41] the seals is the revelation of jesus
[28:44] christ that's right
[28:45] and when you see jesus christ revealed
[28:48] you will automatically see the
[28:50] opposition
[28:52] check how many times brother brown calls
[28:54] him that other fellow that other guy
[28:57] that's writing off
[28:59] if you see two people in the bible you
[29:01] better believe one of them's got to be
[29:02] the antichrist
[29:03] because there's only one person in the
[29:05] bible revealed
[29:07] i like the way brother brown says things
[29:09] he said
[29:10] jesus is not the second person
[29:14] third person second person
[29:16] he said he's not even the first person
[29:18] that's right
[29:20] and that's a direct quote if you want
[29:22] him i'll be glad to get it he said he is
[29:24] the person
[29:27] see if you say a first person that means
[29:29] they can be two or three more
[29:32] but when you say that just one person
[29:36] that's why he could see that one person
[29:39] revealed to him
[29:40] was the revelation of jesus christ when
[29:43] that seal unfolded
[29:46] he saw that jesus that he preached all
[29:48] those years
[29:50] and he saw another fellow riding on
[29:54] so then that way it gives you a better
[29:55] understanding of reading the seal book
[29:59] because you're reading to see a book not
[30:01] to find out what's going to happen to
[30:03] you
[30:06] but to find out who you are right
[30:09] that's right we read the bible to try to
[30:11] find it well if i could just find the
[30:13] things i need to get rid of and the
[30:15] things i need to do but don't worry
[30:17] about it they're in there you'll find it
[30:21] you ought to know it that's right i know
[30:23] my problems don't you
[30:26] i live with me
[30:29] but you see
[30:30] we read the bible trying to find out
[30:32] where to make us good or right you know
[30:34] earth made us bad that we can repent of
[30:36] that's that's all right good
[30:38] but why not read it to see who you are
[30:43] the book's written to you
[30:45] i always tell you this is my bible
[30:49] i mean is this don't belong to my wife
[30:53] somebody give it to me i forgot to give
[30:55] you this one brother gave me one
[30:57] i'll wear them out you know
[30:59] but this is my bible
[31:01] this book is talking to me you've got to
[31:04] have your own bible
[31:06] now that don't mean she can't read my
[31:08] bible
[31:09] josh has got my old one with all of the
[31:12] notes in it if you ever want to know
[31:13] anything ask josh he sits down and used
[31:15] to sit down here with us and questions
[31:16] and answers and they always told him he
[31:18] couldn't answer them because he had a
[31:19] cheat sheet
[31:22] you know when he was asking what was and
[31:24] josh had it written down he wasn't
[31:25] allowed to answer
[31:27] all right that's fine but still that's
[31:29] my book
[31:30] the bible is speaking personally to me
[31:32] you understand
[31:34] that's right you've got to believe it's
[31:35] speaking to you
[31:37] all right
[31:38] now see that way that it's my book
[31:41] we'll get to it when we get into
[31:42] revelations 5. all right
[31:44] but now getting on to the point of
[31:45] another thing
[31:48] he said well what about revelation 10 7.
[31:53] and like 18 4 those two you know the
[31:55] quoted because
[31:56] i had the brothers sliding those under
[31:59] the table under my nose one time when i
[32:01] was trying to say this
[32:03] when i told him i said brothers brother
[32:05] brown said in
[32:07] the feast of the trumpets
[32:11] he said in the seal book i gave him
[32:12] quote after quote but i said in a feast
[32:14] to the trumpet
[32:16] he said this is thus left the lord all
[32:18] the way through
[32:21] i said in that message he emphatically
[32:22] states
[32:23] the bride goes up 4-1 we'll read it
[32:27] doesn't come back from 1921.
[32:30] but see their minds couldn't comprehend
[32:31] what was being said
[32:33] but you know it's a very simple thing to
[32:35] me because after the lord spoke to me
[32:38] and you know what i'm glad that day see
[32:40] there must need to be heresies that they
[32:42] that approve may be made manifest and
[32:44] you know until that day i had a doubt in
[32:46] my own mind
[32:48] about what i was saying
[32:51] i could quote brother brown
[32:53] but i didn't have anything anchored into
[32:55] my heart
[32:58] that i could discuss it with you from my
[33:00] own revelation
[33:02] i had the quotes from the prophet and i
[33:04] believed it all right
[33:07] now
[33:08] then i didn't try to figure it out
[33:11] so we were coming back up the road and
[33:13] this brother he said brother daley said
[33:16] i've never seen your expression like
[33:18] that
[33:20] i said what do you mean he said you look
[33:22] so down and out
[33:24] when you left that meeting i said
[33:26] brother
[33:27] you don't understand
[33:30] i said i gave them what brother brown
[33:32] said
[33:36] and they were just sitting there turning
[33:37] it apart by their own intellectual
[33:39] concept
[33:41] because they couldn't comprehend
[33:44] and it just dropped down
[33:47] the very key let's go to revelation 10
[33:49] and we're going to go to this this way
[33:51] but we will
[33:53] i've preached this to you before so most
[33:55] of you know look in revelations 10 and
[33:57] let's read what it says
[34:02] maybe they'll catch up by the time i'll
[34:04] start reading brother if you want to go
[34:05] to revelation 10 and i'll start reading
[34:07] in chapter verse 1 of revelation 10.
[34:10] and look what he says and i saw another
[34:12] mighty angel come down from heaven
[34:14] flowed with a cloud okay it doesn't got
[34:16] me
[34:17] they're sharper than i am
[34:19] they're younger than i am too yeah
[34:22] look what he says
[34:25] and i saw another mighty angel come down
[34:27] from heaven over the cloud and a rainbow
[34:29] was upon his head and his face was it
[34:31] were the sun and his feet as pillars of
[34:34] fire
[34:37] all right
[34:42] brother brown said on page 72 and 74 the
[34:44] seal book
[34:46] the revelation 10 1 is the same as
[34:48] revelations
[34:50] 1
[34:52] 10 through 13.
[34:57] okay
[34:59] so we're starting off with what
[35:02] what's seen on the bride
[35:04] right
[35:07] now i didn't give these answers your
[35:09] prophet gave it
[35:10] we'll be glad to get a seal and let you
[35:12] run it up a little bit
[35:15] he said it's the same as revelations one
[35:18] one standing in the midst of seven
[35:19] golden candlestick like in the son of
[35:20] man buried about the pout from the
[35:22] golden girdle
[35:24] which is a feminist form showing the
[35:26] girdle
[35:27] the thing is over his shoulders but it's
[35:29] down in coverness the girl it's the the
[35:31] women you know gird about the power what
[35:34] now he hadn't had he had in his hand a
[35:37] little book open
[35:39] and he set his right foot upon the sea
[35:40] and his left foot on the earth now let
[35:43] me ask you a question
[35:45] i mentioned the other night
[35:50] is brother brown
[35:52] a part of the bride of christ
[35:54] amen
[35:58] you agree with that statement
[35:59] that brother branham was a part of the
[36:01] bride of christ
[36:04] now you'd be
[36:06] silly to say that he wouldn't
[36:08] because you'd be putting him outside of
[36:10] it somewhere and you'd have the
[36:12] doctrines like some of the brothers had
[36:14] gotten that brother brown was an old
[36:15] testament prophet
[36:17] in the new testament age
[36:20] unless doctrines among this message i
[36:21] didn't cover that one on the doctrine
[36:23] here a while back that's a doctrine
[36:25] prevalent among the ministers of the
[36:27] message
[36:28] brother branham was an old testament
[36:29] prophet in the new testament age i said
[36:31] brothers you've got a problem because he
[36:33] may he would be an unregenerated
[36:37] person
[36:40] that's right that's your problem
[36:44] all right
[36:46] but look
[36:47] then revelations 1
[36:52] 10 through 13.
[36:54] would be showing the bride of jesus
[36:56] christ that's right
[36:58] you agree amen
[37:00] you see brother brown would be part of
[37:01] it paul be a part of it irenaeus martin
[37:04] columbo
[37:05] all of them that's what he was seeing
[37:07] not just one church age
[37:09] but he's seeing them all
[37:11] all right
[37:13] so then when you see the bride no wonder
[37:15] brother branham would say
[37:18] let's see he said well will the bride
[37:20] have a ministry
[37:23] and watch what he said
[37:25] she said sure
[37:28] the bride will have a ministry said sure
[37:31] she
[37:33] consists
[37:34] that i'm quoting verbatim
[37:36] of apostles and prophets evangelists
[37:38] pastors and teachers
[37:42] she consists he the bride consists of
[37:44] that
[37:45] because all of those five whole
[37:46] ministries is in the body of christ
[37:49] right
[37:50] so brother brown would be in the body of
[37:52] christ so that would take him out of
[37:53] revelations 1 1 i mean 10 1
[37:57] that's right
[37:59] see that would put him exactly where he
[38:00] got to pull that back up now
[38:02] i would put him exactly where he's
[38:04] standing
[38:07] his brother brown standing there
[38:09] in the bride of christ
[38:11] see we want to isolate him by itself
[38:16] and he doesn't he wants to be it with
[38:18] the bride of jesus christ
[38:21] and i saw another mighty angel come down
[38:22] from heaven
[38:24] pulled with a cloud and a rainbow was
[38:26] upon his head and his face where is that
[38:28] where the sun in his feet is filled with
[38:29] the fire now if you make that brother
[38:31] branham in a literal point look what
[38:32] you've got right
[38:35] you got deity right that's right
[38:38] okay
[38:40] but if you make it revelations one the
[38:42] bride
[38:43] she is deity and
[38:50] jeffersonville he was talking about
[38:52] brother branham being deity i said and i
[38:55] pointed over his brother i said if
[38:56] you'll tell me that brother got the holy
[38:57] ghost standing right there
[38:59] that he's as much deity as brother
[39:01] browning
[39:02] taking away the gifts and taking away
[39:03] the signs and wonders you know just as
[39:05] an individual i said then i'll go a long
[39:07] way that brother brown was deity
[39:09] he said oh no brother
[39:12] well i knew who i stopped to do so we
[39:13] don't need to discuss it
[39:16] he had brother brown as deity and the
[39:18] rest of us is not in his i don't know
[39:21] or like the other brother says we're a
[39:22] heist of god maybe
[39:24] so that would be a demon god
[39:27] you know and that's what it is he's not
[39:29] a full god
[39:30] but listen
[39:32] we know that he had a book in his hand
[39:35] that's not brother brandon that's right
[39:37] that's the lord jesus christ in bride
[39:39] home
[39:40] that's right with brother adam was
[39:42] standing there keep on going now and we
[39:44] cried
[39:45] and lord going down to chapter verse
[39:47] seven because anybody don't know the
[39:49] rest of it you might get all of it
[39:52] but in the days of the voice of the
[39:54] seventh angel
[39:56] when he shall begin to sound
[39:58] the mystery of god should be finished as
[40:00] he has declared to his servants the
[40:02] prophet
[40:03] now who is the voice of the seventh
[40:05] angel
[40:08] okay that's brother brandon amen now
[40:10] we're right
[40:13] we're right we got brother brown in the
[40:14] right order
[40:16] he is the angel to
[40:18] not the ladies and church age
[40:21] he said if you do that he said you make
[40:22] me a pentecost
[40:25] that's where people don't follow the
[40:27] message that's right
[40:29] there's only seven church ages right
[40:31] right there's only seven church
[40:33] messengers but brother brown placed
[40:35] eight church messengers
[40:38] 464 seal book copy it off if you want to
[40:43] all iranians martin clumble luther
[40:45] wesley and elijah
[40:47] you got your seven
[40:49] everybody looks at that and said brother
[40:50] brown was the messenger of the seventh
[40:52] church age he was not the messenger of
[40:54] the seventh church age right
[40:56] but around said the one-eyed black man
[41:00] was the messenger to let to azusa street
[41:04] you want these quotes just go to 464 to
[41:06] see a book marina
[41:10] but when you read it he'll say
[41:13] that there was another great prophet
[41:15] came
[41:17] he said lutheran wesley and he said in
[41:19] another great prophet that wasn't
[41:20] brother brown i'd listen to the quote
[41:22] you want it we'll be glad to get
[41:23] somebody and they could run it up back
[41:25] there in a hurry and give it to you
[41:28] and he says
[41:30] no messenger to the age because the holy
[41:31] ghost came himself
[41:33] in his fullness in the baptism he said
[41:36] he said but at the end of the age at all
[41:38] the other age then the messenger came
[41:40] running around came at the end of the
[41:41] lady of sin
[41:43] amen
[41:44] because you've got to go back into the
[41:46] scriptures of uh you know
[41:49] exodus and all of that and uh especially
[41:52] ezekiel i mean not ezekiel but um
[41:55] leviticus
[41:56] and picking that word leviticus um 25
[42:00] 8. where the seven sevens is 49
[42:04] and see then you've got to have a
[42:05] messenger to come right amen if brother
[42:07] branham was only the messenger to the
[42:09] zeus street then you have no rapture
[42:14] but it's not nine eight messengers like
[42:17] messengers that we take them to you you
[42:19] get all messed up
[42:21] there's eight manifestations of the holy
[42:23] spirit of god
[42:24] that's right
[42:26] down through seven church ages and i put
[42:28] you where brother brown could bring us
[42:30] the message of eternity
[42:33] okay
[42:35] brother brandon brought the message of
[42:36] eternity you agree with that
[42:38] see then he wasn't a messenger at the
[42:40] end of the ages
[42:41] he was the messenger to come to the end
[42:43] of the age
[42:44] i figured they'd get it by then
[42:46] i preached long huh
[42:48] all right so this is 464 the seal book
[42:51] which is actually run it back down just
[42:53] a hard brother where we can see
[42:55] 1963 324 which runs your paragraph 52
[42:59] but it's actually 464 of your seal book
[43:01] all right
[43:03] each one of those ages only taken to dip
[43:05] into the holy spirit justification is
[43:07] the work of the holy spirit
[43:08] sanctification is the work of the holy
[43:09] spirit but the baptism is the holy
[43:11] spirit now listen
[43:13] that's the reason it took a prophetic
[43:15] prophet to come down
[43:17] no messenger to the age
[43:21] because the messenger coming to zeus the
[43:23] street with the gifts
[43:24] come on
[43:26] because the holy ghost came himself in
[43:28] his fullness of the baptism
[43:31] on his sister's street
[43:33] he came down to give the people the
[43:35] baptism of the holy ghost just like it
[43:37] was in the book of acts right amen
[43:39] not the upper room of the hundred and
[43:41] twenty now
[43:42] the three thousand downstairs we've done
[43:44] priesthood it's split
[43:46] all right because the three thousand
[43:47] downstairs only heard one message they
[43:49] couldn't be put up here at the faith of
[43:51] the father
[43:52] they couldn't be brought up this
[43:53] position they only heard one message but
[43:55] 120 in the upper room are two or three
[43:57] life years and jesus is mentioned all
[43:59] right look what he said but at the end
[44:01] of the ages always end up on the other
[44:02] we find then
[44:04] there then the messenger sent and all
[44:06] these scruples and things are to be
[44:07] placed in to their place
[44:10] all right so then i would solve the
[44:12] problem with me to understand it and to
[44:15] see
[44:16] that
[44:17] but you say well now give us something
[44:22] and that's what i said i was riding up
[44:23] the road
[44:28] and something spoke
[44:31] he said the key is revelations 10 7
[44:34] verse the first word
[44:36] to pull that up brother
[44:39] revelations 10 7
[44:42] the key is the first word that's right
[44:51] amen
[44:53] now
[44:55] remember what john is to do
[44:58] trying to express it
[45:01] john is
[45:02] to write down
[45:05] what he sees and hears right right
[45:07] and he wrote in symbols that's right he
[45:10] joined it right and saw in heaven open
[45:12] door and that door was jesus he didn't
[45:14] do that
[45:17] he didn't write white horse rider and
[45:18] that was the antichrist he didn't do
[45:20] that
[45:21] he done exactly what he was told to do
[45:25] right
[45:26] whether he knew it or not
[45:28] what he was doing
[45:30] he had to do what god gave him
[45:34] all right
[45:36] but god knew
[45:40] right
[45:40] that in the end time they'd be a prophet
[45:46] come on he knew there'd be a prophet in
[45:48] the end time to tell what that open door
[45:50] was to tell what that antichrist was
[45:52] that's right
[45:55] all right remember now revelation 10 is
[45:58] already past the opening of the seals
[46:02] they're in six and and going over you
[46:04] got to get to the seven to cover the the
[46:06] i believe it's eight one eight one
[46:08] you're gonna go to eight one to get the
[46:09] seventh seal that's right
[46:11] all right
[46:12] john's over and he sees all these things
[46:14] and a great multitude of people in the
[46:17] redemption of all mankind
[46:19] and remember what john was to do
[46:26] you remember that in his writing
[46:29] chapter 1
[46:30] john write what you see
[46:34] and send it to the church
[46:38] right amen now that's what it says
[46:40] i and send it to the church
[46:42] so he sent it to us send it to the bride
[46:44] of christ that whatever they could
[46:46] comprehend down to the ages they could
[46:48] handle the part but you know especially
[46:50] in this end time
[46:55] john you're supposed to write it
[46:58] now you've done wrote chapter one two
[47:01] three four five six seven eight nine
[47:08] now how in the world is god going to get
[47:10] that to the bride of jesus christ in the
[47:12] seventh church age
[47:13] for her to understand
[47:20] john what are you going to do
[47:24] john sets our search in his mind
[47:29] i've seen all these things
[47:31] yes they are of god
[47:35] and i've got to get it
[47:37] back to the church age
[47:41] john sees right then
[47:44] as brother branham kept emphasizing he
[47:47] said so thereby
[47:49] the seventh
[47:50] angel
[47:52] must be a prophet
[47:55] you want those quotes
[47:58] thereby the seventh angel
[48:00] must be a prophet
[48:02] for the word to come to
[48:06] so now he's got the key
[48:10] so john writes but
[48:13] he said what does that do with it
[48:18] well if you get your head out of the
[48:20] sand and quit thinking about a billy
[48:22] goat button his head
[48:25] or forgive me what you're sitting on
[48:31] and get your mind into the spiritual
[48:33] mechanical realms of the holy ghost
[48:36] and listen to him that's right
[48:39] how can i get that back there
[48:43] these seven thunders have uttered their
[48:45] voices
[48:47] come on right above it all right all
[48:49] right
[48:51] how am i going to get it back there
[48:55] it strikes john
[48:57] he said but
[48:59] that seven church age
[49:01] messenger will be a prophet
[49:04] that can bring these forwards yes
[49:08] but don't put brother branham in
[49:10] revelation 10 7
[49:13] it puts him in revelation 3 14.
[49:17] come on
[49:20] 3 14 is a description of the lord jesus
[49:22] christ right the beginning of the
[49:24] creation of god and the messenger to the
[49:26] age and the ending up of all things
[49:31] and what does he say but in the days of
[49:33] the voice of the 7th angel
[49:35] when he begins to sound yep
[49:38] all these things that i've wrote
[49:42] is going to be made known to him
[49:45] and he can bring it to the bride
[49:50] all right
[49:52] are you listening
[49:53] so it doesn't move brother brown to
[49:54] revelation 10 7.
[49:58] he's in revelation 3 14. and going on
[50:00] down to 22 i think it is
[50:02] the last part about you know into the
[50:04] messenger age and the overcomer and
[50:06] whatever overcomer of this age would be
[50:10] now
[50:12] but in the days of the voice
[50:16] that doesn't put brother brown there on
[50:18] another account either
[50:20] is because
[50:22] this message will go to israel
[50:28] there will be two prophets
[50:31] that will open those seals quoting
[50:33] brother brown
[50:34] to israel
[50:36] he said they open that sixth seal
[50:38] anytime they want to
[50:42] which means the plagues and the viles
[50:44] and the
[50:44] torments going to happen under the sixth
[50:46] seal right
[50:49] see these seals are going to israel
[50:52] that's why the first seal says
[50:55] is that the man of sin sitting in the
[50:56] temple of god you better believe we
[50:58] better not be here when that man sits
[51:00] there
[51:01] because if we see him sitting there
[51:03] physically happening
[51:05] you better believe we've done miss the
[51:07] rapture
[51:08] amen
[51:09] and we're in the tribulation
[51:12] right
[51:14] because there ain't no second rapture to
[51:16] take care of the people that miss the
[51:17] first one
[51:20] right so get serious and think about it
[51:24] see this message will go to israel
[51:26] that's revelation 10 7 to that part
[51:30] those two witnesses will pick up this
[51:31] message you want it out of the syllable
[51:33] he said they'll tell them you missed it
[51:35] they said a bride called him sin the
[51:36] seventh seal right the bride caught it
[51:39] she's gone
[51:43] you know the days of the voice of the
[51:44] seventh angel you're not gonna
[51:45] understand
[51:47] revelation 18 4 doesn't have to be come
[51:50] out of her my people israel has got to
[51:53] come out of
[51:55] that antichrist covenant that's right
[51:59] so it's a twofold meaning yes
[52:04] you understand
[52:06] but you see
[52:07] we still hold with our mind but brother
[52:10] dale i don't understand you're so deep
[52:14] i don't see anything deep of what i just
[52:15] brought out
[52:21] that brother branham don't run around
[52:23] don't go to israel
[52:26] that's this just elijah
[52:29] but his message win
[52:31] the fifth elijah will take the message
[52:33] of the fourth elijah
[52:35] right
[52:37] and speak to israel amen
[52:39] that's right
[52:42] right yes
[52:43] that was one thing when i was in israel
[52:45] to find out
[52:47] the jews because i never looked it up
[52:49] and wade did he looked up and preached a
[52:50] marvelous thing on it now and we begin
[52:52] to understand you know the jews when
[52:54] they sit at that table and everything
[52:56] and eating that passover they leave a
[52:58] seat there that's right and it's for
[53:00] elijah
[53:03] because they believe elijah is going to
[53:05] come before the messiah that's right
[53:09] well if moses was the word back there
[53:12] and moses will be the christ that elijah
[53:14] will precede coming with him right
[53:17] so it's all in the message
[53:19] that's right
[53:20] see church is not hard to understand but
[53:22] it's just to get away from our
[53:24] understanding amen
[53:26] well it's got to be over here right
[53:27] brothers i'm taking pushing on the the
[53:30] book of revelations not in in correct
[53:32] chronological order i see
[53:34] i'm sorry
[53:36] your prophet said
[53:38] it was perfectly in order right
[53:45] the book of revelations is perfectly
[53:47] inordinate
[53:49] it don't have to be scrambled around and
[53:51] move back and forth
[53:53] it's in perfect order
[53:55] but now brother branham was only in the
[53:57] revelations 3 14 through the 7th church
[54:00] age
[54:01] and was not over in revelation 10 you
[54:03] would be jugged in your books to try to
[54:04] find something
[54:06] but it's his message
[54:08] in revelations 10 1
[54:11] is the bride of jesus christ
[54:15] that's what your prophet said
[54:19] well i can't understand that why because
[54:21] you don't have the holy ghost to
[54:22] understand it with you
[54:24] right
[54:26] i'm sorry
[54:29] i'm seeing people by talking like that
[54:30] but i'm sorry it's true
[54:32] if we don't have the holy spirit he
[54:33] can't reveal anything to us
[54:42] oh you just study it all out brother
[54:43] dale
[54:44] i've told you before when that first
[54:46] seal broke to me
[54:48] i was running a job and it took two
[54:49] people to run a man couldn't relieve me
[54:51] for take a break
[54:53] i'd have to come back and hit him catch
[54:55] back up
[54:56] it was so fast
[54:59] take two people to run the job today i
[55:01] was out
[55:04] and yet god spoke to my heart
[55:07] and i scribbled little notes
[55:10] just words
[55:12] until i could come home and check it out
[55:15] you went in your study and brought on
[55:17] your news praying no isaac general
[55:18] motors making a living
[55:22] now may i say a word here maybe that's
[55:24] what's wrong with a lot of preachers
[55:27] in their study they think praying to
[55:29] find something they might need to get
[55:32] them a job go to work they wouldn't be a
[55:34] lazy shiftless bone that's bumming off
[55:36] of the people
[55:37] taking all the money from them that's
[55:40] right amen
[55:42] come on
[55:43] sorry
[55:44] i just saw
[55:49] i just say it like it is and i'm sorry
[55:52] we get to heaven i'll still apologize
[55:54] again
[55:56] we get there we don't have very much to
[55:58] worry about
[56:00] but are you listening
[56:02] see trying to cover that
[56:05] you don't have to move us about right
[56:08] just see where we're at
[56:10] the bride in revelations
[56:13] one now listen i'm gonna say something
[56:15] to you so you have to catch on
[56:16] the bride in revelations 1
[56:19] is shown on earth
[56:21] that's right
[56:25] all right
[56:30] the book was closed
[56:32] in chapter one
[56:35] the book was closed in chapter two
[56:38] the book was closed in three
[56:41] and we'll get down to it
[56:43] you begin to see what it looks like as
[56:45] it tries to be opened in chapter four
[56:47] five shows it open
[56:55] ten
[56:56] we're not
[57:08] see
[57:10] it's the same as revelations 5
[57:12] because in chapter 10 the book is open
[57:18] you say but it seems to be up it's open
[57:22] it becomes open
[57:24] well here on earth right until we go
[57:27] there
[57:28] revelation 21 we're in heaven
[57:31] but yet we come right back here to earth
[57:34] wonderful story let me get off of that
[57:36] okay
[57:37] i hope you follow yes all right so let's
[57:40] start and try to pick up something
[57:42] just for a few minutes
[57:44] i know we won't get it down to it we'll
[57:46] finish this afternoon but that's all
[57:48] right
[57:49] look at number five and let's just pick
[57:51] up
[57:52] because these quotes have been given
[57:54] unto you but as a partial point as to
[57:55] proving a voice as to proving a uh open
[57:59] door
[58:00] now we're talking about
[58:02] looking at it in a different light
[58:05] so this is revelation chapter four
[58:09] 1960-1239 oh and noticed john being
[58:12] taken up immediately after the church
[58:13] age was the top of the rapture church
[58:18] don't think that 4-1 is the top of the
[58:19] raptured church okay now
[58:23] immediately after the church age is over
[58:25] this lady will see an age
[58:27] then comes the rapture the church goes
[58:29] up with like john did into the presence
[58:31] of god why because he's at the top
[58:33] calling himself just like jacob's ladder
[58:35] just like stephen's seeing heaven open
[58:37] and there's one sitting on the throne
[58:38] we'll get to that when we get there so
[58:40] you just read chapter four over and over
[58:43] but what does it do and the bride goes
[58:44] up
[58:45] immediately after the church age is over
[58:49] it's like i said
[58:50] isn't it something for us to stand here
[58:53] and comprehend these things
[58:55] before we get there yes
[58:59] the bride of jesus christ has the book
[59:01] unveiled to her but this book is not
[59:03] unveiled to the world that's right
[59:06] the denominations and and the ones in
[59:08] this mention they can't see the book
[59:11] right
[59:12] i can't see these things
[59:15] but then they're still books and
[59:17] scrolls and and all kinds of things
[59:24] like i said i put in a key every once in
[59:26] a while
[59:28] you remember
[59:29] in chapter five you find a lamb with
[59:32] seven horns and seven eyes
[59:34] funny looking lamb
[59:38] that's the bride of jesus christ
[59:43] now look at the next one number six
[59:50] this is taken from revelation chapter
[59:52] four part two you're to read this is two
[59:53] part readings one and two is the two
[59:55] different dates if you'll notice another
[59:57] sixty um
[59:59] 30 or something like 31 this goes over
[1:00:01] to uh 101 all right 61.
[1:00:06] we find that after after these things
[1:00:10] after a minute that after the church
[1:00:12] ages has ceased
[1:00:15] then john was solomon's to come up
[1:00:16] higher
[1:00:18] come up hither he seen the church ages
[1:00:20] that didn't mean the church ages would
[1:00:22] overwhelm we're still here in it right
[1:00:24] right he sees it over
[1:00:28] john sees the church age over does
[1:00:31] everybody understand that
[1:00:32] and he goes up
[1:00:35] there's the top of the rapture
[1:00:38] and he was on earth seeing what was down
[1:00:39] here now he's going to the heavenlies
[1:00:42] all right and y'all know someone to come
[1:00:44] up come up here which means come up here
[1:00:46] he showed him all that was going to
[1:00:49] happen in the world of this church age
[1:00:52] then after the church age was over we
[1:00:53] find then that john was the type of ever
[1:00:56] true believer that will be summoned by
[1:00:58] christ on high that's right summons come
[1:01:00] up higher he was in the candlestick
[1:01:02] speaking from them to his church then
[1:01:05] when the church age had ceased he left
[1:01:08] the earth and moved up into the heavens
[1:01:10] and he called his redeemed up with him
[1:01:13] oh isn't that beautiful oh it makes my
[1:01:16] heartless jump
[1:01:17] amen
[1:01:19] see just because it is written there
[1:01:21] that that john goes up that doesn't mean
[1:01:23] that it took place right there
[1:01:26] he was only typing that right
[1:01:29] that'll take place the day winkle was
[1:01:31] that's right you agree that's right the
[1:01:33] day the bride goes up is when that'll
[1:01:35] take place
[1:01:38] who cares what time it'll be i i'm 72. i
[1:01:40] don't want it to last a long time you
[1:01:42] know but still what does it matter
[1:01:45] i don't care if you have to roll me down
[1:01:47] this
[1:01:47] house in a wheelchair
[1:01:50] and i don't even halfway know who i am
[1:01:53] i'll still be saying praise the lord
[1:01:57] you know
[1:01:58] i always told you the other day and i
[1:02:00] know it don't sound good to people that
[1:02:01] maybe their families have got it but
[1:02:03] you ought to look at that person in your
[1:02:05] family that's got alzheimer's and just
[1:02:06] love them
[1:02:08] instead of being hateful to them and
[1:02:10] arrogant and everything
[1:02:12] they don't know
[1:02:14] you know what they don't know wrong
[1:02:19] they might talk vulgar but that's not
[1:02:21] their guilty that's that's not right
[1:02:25] you're look at them in different ways
[1:02:28] all right
[1:02:29] now let's do next one
[1:02:34] there was a voice that called him this
[1:02:36] is on revelation chapter four which is
[1:02:38] back the one you know part one there was
[1:02:40] a voice that called him over that voice
[1:02:42] i can't get away from that that voice
[1:02:44] of that one behind him then he looked
[1:02:47] around here there and he showed him all
[1:02:49] the church ages because he was standing
[1:02:51] in the church ages the seven golden
[1:02:53] candles did and he heard that voice
[1:02:55] after the church 86 the voice that left
[1:02:57] the earth went up when he got in the
[1:02:59] glory he heard him say come up here i'm
[1:03:01] going to show you what's going to happen
[1:03:03] from here after that's what the title of
[1:03:06] the message is
[1:03:07] after this or hereafter
[1:03:09] all right
[1:03:11] now let's see if we can get one more
[1:03:14] go up to number eight
[1:03:16] this is pretty good reading paragraph
[1:03:18] 121
[1:03:20] going down
[1:03:22] this is 1962 31 revelation chapter four
[1:03:25] now immediately after he showed the end
[1:03:26] of the age of his work here he went on
[1:03:30] up into heaven he said i'll show you
[1:03:32] what's going to be after this after the
[1:03:34] church agent and like i said john
[1:03:36] is going to be shown the future right
[1:03:41] see everybody wants to deal with how far
[1:03:43] brother one time wanted to know how far
[1:03:45] did you know everyone said it slanted
[1:03:47] over 20 feet over there he said how far
[1:03:50] did they go up i said slanted 20 feet
[1:03:56] i don't know was it 200 feet 10 000 10
[1:04:00] million what's the difference
[1:04:04] your prophet said in a slant over there
[1:04:07] about 20 feet where another dimension
[1:04:12] dementors don't have to be thousands of
[1:04:13] miles apart they can overlap each other
[1:04:15] and just run backwards and forward
[1:04:19] but you see that's what we try to figure
[1:04:21] things out yeah well what good would it
[1:04:23] do if i could figure out it it wasn't 20
[1:04:26] feet it's 19 and three quarters
[1:04:29] now boy wouldn't that be something
[1:04:31] you are smart
[1:04:34] now how you gonna get over there
[1:04:38] that good southern language how you
[1:04:40] gonna get over here
[1:04:42] how are you going to get that
[1:04:46] but listen look what he says
[1:04:50] he says john i can't talk to you down
[1:04:52] here there
[1:04:55] now what about the great revelations
[1:04:57] he's already given him in chapter one
[1:04:58] two and three
[1:05:02] he said john
[1:05:04] you gotta come up here
[1:05:06] you gotta get away from the earth
[1:05:08] oh wonderful what he saw right now did
[1:05:11] you got to get up a little higher
[1:05:13] i think church it's about time that we
[1:05:15] raised just a little bit higher
[1:05:18] in our understanding
[1:05:20] not to get away from the message no sir
[1:05:24] but to see what the messenger is talking
[1:05:26] about
[1:05:28] john is the type of the rapture
[1:05:31] did that mean you didn't go up there
[1:05:35] oh but brother tail blood around the
[1:05:36] city saw all of us there
[1:05:39] i agree with him
[1:05:41] he saw all of us there
[1:05:44] and i'm not making no joke out of it but
[1:05:46] he went to hell he saw people there too
[1:05:48] so which place did he see me and you
[1:05:50] we got a choice to decide whether we're
[1:05:52] down there or up there
[1:05:55] right
[1:05:57] and the new birth is the only difference
[1:06:01] i mean how smart we are how much we know
[1:06:02] about the message it's whether or not
[1:06:04] we're born again or not
[1:06:05] but if you're not born again you can't
[1:06:07] be resurrected sitting in heavenly
[1:06:08] places in christ jesus
[1:06:11] right
[1:06:12] because it takes that new birth all
[1:06:14] right
[1:06:15] because i left down there i've come up
[1:06:17] higher come up here with me i like that
[1:06:21] we talked about brother branham saying
[1:06:23] you know when he did and it's a
[1:06:24] wonderful thing
[1:06:26] for him to be out there you know when he
[1:06:27] was hunting and
[1:06:28] the cloud was taken away into different
[1:06:30] things
[1:06:31] and the lord said just come and walk
[1:06:32] with me
[1:06:34] amen that's right oh that's beautiful
[1:06:36] words
[1:06:39] for him to just come and walk with it
[1:06:42] well john says come up here where i'm at
[1:06:46] you can't stay down there and we stay up
[1:06:47] here and we make this contact aware that
[1:06:50] this can happen you know what you can
[1:06:51] understand all right
[1:06:53] show you what's going to take place
[1:06:54] you're actually caught up in a vision
[1:06:56] caught up in the glory see everybody
[1:06:58] wants to argue whether it was there
[1:06:59] physically or whether it was their
[1:07:02] you know a vision and then they split
[1:07:04] churches over that it's that doctrine
[1:07:06] yeah
[1:07:08] split churches over just that doctrine
[1:07:15] let's see
[1:07:17] yeah i know it but i know it's not on
[1:07:19] that one i don't think brother said i
[1:07:21] don't care whether it goes up before the
[1:07:23] tribulation or after the tribulation i
[1:07:25] just want to make sure that i go up
[1:07:31] his experience
[1:07:34] now i love that
[1:07:39] john had an experience
[1:07:41] amen amen
[1:07:43] john had the experience of going beyond
[1:07:46] the curtain of time
[1:07:48] brother adam had an experience of going
[1:07:50] beyond the curtain of time right
[1:07:53] john had an experience
[1:07:57] right
[1:07:58] you know john saw itself
[1:08:01] yes
[1:08:05] that's well and over in the seal book
[1:08:07] right
[1:08:08] but you know that john looked at her and
[1:08:10] he saw 12 apostles and 12 patriarchs
[1:08:13] we'll get to that tonight
[1:08:15] but you know when he gets over into the
[1:08:16] city he sees the name right now
[1:08:21] well john's name would be written in one
[1:08:24] of the stones right
[1:08:25] now it was one of the apostles
[1:08:28] he saw his name
[1:08:31] we'll see can we see our name amen
[1:08:33] not armand never brought around the side
[1:08:36] he said because it's not in the bible
[1:08:37] that way he said well what's going on
[1:08:39] for the hour
[1:08:41] look out here and see the economy
[1:08:43] falling apart see the world falling
[1:08:44] apart see all this thing happened we
[1:08:46] shot glory hallelujah
[1:08:49] we're crazy
[1:08:51] right amen we're just flat crazy
[1:08:55] things start falling apart we say praise
[1:08:56] the lord
[1:08:59] what hey i'm losing my home i'm losing
[1:09:01] my heart pray for
[1:09:09] see we don't read the scripture do we
[1:09:11] that's right
[1:09:12] all things work together
[1:09:16] for thee called according to his purpose
[1:09:27] just remember no sickness can't come on
[1:09:29] you unless god allows it
[1:09:32] and he's got it there for a reason
[1:09:36] now a lot of the reason might be old age
[1:09:40] no problem
[1:09:41] we blame the devil for everything i
[1:09:43] blame him for
[1:09:46] wow get an old car you get two hundred
[1:09:50] thousand miles on what dirty called it
[1:09:52] bucket of boats
[1:09:53] we're gonna buy a bucket of boats
[1:09:55] they're making good money out of it and
[1:09:56] they're going for that bucket of boats
[1:09:59] twenty thousand miles a second
[1:10:13] john's
[1:10:14] experience now watch
[1:10:18] his experience
[1:10:21] john's experience
[1:10:24] must have been something like that of
[1:10:26] paul's
[1:10:32] second corinthians 12 2 4 if you're
[1:10:34] putting it down ii corinthians 2 4.
[1:10:36] paul was caught up one day
[1:10:39] in a into a vision
[1:10:42] did you know that
[1:10:43] he saw things that wasn't expedient for
[1:10:45] him to even talk about
[1:10:47] 14 years
[1:10:49] never even mentioned it see but listen
[1:10:52] at the difference between them
[1:10:56] now why was it that paul
[1:11:00] couldn't write
[1:11:02] what he saw
[1:11:08] you don't never think that
[1:11:10] those are the questions i have those are
[1:11:12] the thoughts
[1:11:13] i mean you know paul's a prophet
[1:11:17] why couldn't he write about it
[1:11:19] see it wasn't time
[1:11:24] it wasn't time for it to be written
[1:11:28] now i get it you listen you'll hear the
[1:11:29] prophet saying that
[1:11:32] but listen at the difference between now
[1:11:34] paul and john what's the difference
[1:11:35] between them right
[1:11:37] what paul saw he was forbidden to speak
[1:11:39] on
[1:11:40] or to put it out to the public
[1:11:43] and remember brother brown third full
[1:11:45] not to be made known to the public
[1:11:48] you know okay
[1:11:49] right
[1:11:50] listen what he said
[1:11:52] oh my i don't believe he could do it
[1:11:55] he couldn't have caught one time fire
[1:11:57] for a little trip i took one day
[1:12:00] i never got over it and never will
[1:12:02] he saw things that he couldn't talk
[1:12:04] about i guess he didn't have words too
[1:12:08] now you see what i'm saying
[1:12:10] at one time
[1:12:12] he was caught up in the third heavens
[1:12:15] though see up in the third heaven right
[1:12:17] around referred to him zone seven is
[1:12:19] beyond the curtain of time he said i
[1:12:20] believe i went to the first heaven
[1:12:24] that was his word if you didn't need
[1:12:25] that quote
[1:12:27] paragraph 124 look
[1:12:29] how different when john was caught up
[1:12:31] and seen jesus
[1:12:33] he was
[1:12:34] writing in a book what you have seen
[1:12:37] and give it back
[1:12:39] send it back to the church in churches
[1:12:43] but just remember
[1:12:46] he put it in symbols
[1:12:50] it wouldn't time then
[1:12:53] he put it in symbols
[1:12:56] right now
[1:12:58] he was told to write it
[1:13:00] but he put it in symbols
[1:13:02] right
[1:13:02] now listen
[1:13:04] send it back to the church paul was
[1:13:05] forbidden to speak and john was even
[1:13:07] asked to put it in a book
[1:13:09] so it would go all down through the ages
[1:13:12] oh my
[1:13:13] it's revealed now
[1:13:16] to be revealed in this last days
[1:13:19] it wasn't revealed in his days it's
[1:13:22] revealed now as we go along that's right
[1:13:27] paul
[1:13:28] didn't even write it
[1:13:33] but john was told to write
[1:13:36] but he was told to put it in cymbals
[1:13:37] right
[1:13:43] i like revelation 2 three
[1:13:46] that's the church ages and what's going
[1:13:47] on that's not much that's not really
[1:13:49] symbols there's a lot of symbols used
[1:13:51] there
[1:13:54] but listen
[1:13:56] we're in the hour for it to be revealed
[1:13:58] that's right
[1:14:00] we know what the symbols are
[1:14:03] but because we know what the symbols are
[1:14:05] do you know that they say that this
[1:14:06] message is laid in oral roberts
[1:14:08] university
[1:14:10] but it runs a message
[1:14:12] been told that i don't know they've been
[1:14:14] there
[1:14:16] that's hard
[1:14:18] but i've been told it just died
[1:14:22] does that give them the revelation
[1:14:25] what i said about
[1:14:26] burke's larkin
[1:14:28] the white horse rider was the holy ghost
[1:14:32] i mean the water was right with the
[1:14:33] aircraft
[1:14:34] did he understand it when he was riding
[1:14:36] a horse
[1:14:37] that's right
[1:14:41] it was in the time of the antichrist
[1:14:43] system
[1:14:44] in the trinitarian doctrine
[1:14:48] all right
[1:14:49] what are you following them
[1:14:54] all the experience was like john's
[1:14:59] they both saw things
[1:15:02] see
[1:15:04] now this afternoon we'll get it more
[1:15:05] into
[1:15:07] and tie together with even because we
[1:15:08] can do that
[1:15:11] the word brother random gills but i'm
[1:15:12] gonna go ahead and call it out here
[1:15:14] because some of you will
[1:15:15] may not be back this afternoon and some
[1:15:18] on the internet system may not cut back
[1:15:20] on
[1:15:21] so we will just
[1:15:23] give where brother brown says it in the
[1:15:25] seal book he says it on paragraph 2 or
[1:15:28] 23 of the breach
[1:15:30] you know the message of the bricks
[1:15:31] 637-317
[1:15:34] and he says there's something goes on
[1:15:35] here about this fourth chapter and he
[1:15:38] says the bride goes up at the end goes
[1:15:40] up on the third chapter of revelation
[1:15:42] and does not return until 19 21 or 19.
[1:15:46] then he goes over to the fifth seal and
[1:15:48] he repeats almost the same identical
[1:15:50] thing paragraph 87 on the fifth seal he
[1:15:53] goes on into the fifth seal paragraph
[1:15:54] 218
[1:15:56] and he says that when this happens that
[1:15:58] this is not even to us you know
[1:16:02] then when he gets down to the feast of
[1:16:03] the trumpets paragraph 38
[1:16:06] he says
[1:16:08] that the bride goes up in revelation 4 1
[1:16:10] not single 1921.
[1:16:12] they done pulling them up to her
[1:16:14] i'm holding them this evening but you
[1:16:16] can read them off
[1:16:17] but just think about it church
[1:16:21] you and i have the opportunity to
[1:16:22] understand this message
[1:16:24] that's right with the same holy spirit
[1:16:27] that was given on the day of pentecost
[1:16:30] the little bride of christ
[1:16:33] can understand the great mysteries
[1:16:36] and then they'll be very simple john
[1:16:37] looked up and he saw a door he would see
[1:16:39] a door he saw jesus
[1:16:42] but to his mind as a human being it was
[1:16:44] a door so he wrote down door
[1:16:47] right
[1:16:48] over there later he'd see one and call
[1:16:50] it the beast
[1:16:53] but that wasn't what he was seeing
[1:16:57] see john even heard the thunders
[1:17:00] that's what brother brown said
[1:17:01] but he was forbidden dry well that's
[1:17:03] revelation 10 forward
[1:17:06] he heard the time right
[1:17:09] you said what daniel heard him
[1:17:13] well we're looking for thunder it's like
[1:17:14] something that people in the message
[1:17:15] looked at them like some kind of they
[1:17:18] had seven men you know picked out of the
[1:17:20] message each one was supposed to be a
[1:17:22] thunder
[1:17:30] but listen church
[1:17:32] the revelation was gonna set us three
[1:17:33] times amen that's right we'll just drop
[1:17:35] off right here and pick up this
[1:17:36] afternoon amen
[1:17:40] and take on these things
[1:17:43] whenever the rapture comes i just want
[1:17:45] to be there
[1:17:48] the prophet places in order
[1:17:50] gives it like paul's experience what do
[1:17:52] you think about paul
[1:17:54] brother brown said in the book of
[1:17:56] hebrews especially
[1:17:58] he said paul took and used the old
[1:18:00] testament symbols
[1:18:03] to express the book of hebrews
[1:18:06] isn't that something
[1:18:09] paul was a great learned scholar
[1:18:12] he didn't forget all he learned
[1:18:15] oh man but the bible said he did no no
[1:18:17] you read it wrong
[1:18:19] he forgot all it was no good
[1:18:24] he didn't forget all that he'd read
[1:18:28] he forgot all of his denominational
[1:18:30] doctrine
[1:18:32] and come out with jesus christ
[1:18:36] you can't erase a man's memory
[1:18:39] but you can erase from the man the
[1:18:41] doctrine that we have that's what i'm
[1:18:43] trying to do you and i
[1:18:45] and i hope you understood what i'm
[1:18:47] trying to bring today but in the days of
[1:18:48] the voice of the seventh angel
[1:18:51] and he'll put brother brown over there
[1:18:53] that puts him exactly where he was
[1:18:55] revelations three
[1:18:57] the messenger to the seventh church age
[1:18:59] and he said but now wait a minute you
[1:19:00] said he wasn't the messenger
[1:19:02] he wasn't a messenger to the seventh
[1:19:03] church age
[1:19:06] he was a messenger to all
[1:19:08] right
[1:19:11] he was to end it all up
[1:19:14] that's why i love over in leviticus you
[1:19:16] just you get in there sometimes just
[1:19:17] read it seven sevens is 49
[1:19:20] and you gotta step in the world
[1:19:24] because there's no way to get out
[1:19:29] rapture comes in the seventh church age
[1:19:31] with the seven church ages not the
[1:19:33] rapture
[1:19:36] read leviticus 25 8 and then going down
[1:19:38] to verse 10
[1:19:39] and find out
[1:19:40] there comes a 50.
[1:19:42] wrote around and declared a message to
[1:19:44] you and i
[1:19:45] that message is naturally speaking is a
[1:19:47] 49 because it's a symbolic
[1:19:50] but when it's revealed
[1:19:51] it goes into eternal life
[1:19:55] what do we think about these things what
[1:19:57] do you think about the message we've
[1:19:58] heard
[1:20:01] so wonderful
[1:20:02] all the answers that we have needed
[1:20:06] is right in the prophet's name
[1:20:08] he tells you how to raise kids
[1:20:10] he tells you how to be husband and wife
[1:20:13] right
[1:20:14] he tells the kids how to be kids
[1:20:16] in one message
[1:20:18] and what i love about it is i can just
[1:20:20] take the computer and i can pull it in
[1:20:21] there to get a quote and it don't matter
[1:20:23] to me if one's in 47 and the other's in
[1:20:25] 65.
[1:20:28] and i know there was things that he said
[1:20:29] that he upgraded on what he was thinking
[1:20:31] on it but he didn't change if he did he
[1:20:33] told us right
[1:20:38] but what about a message that fits me
[1:20:42] it'd have to be the message of god and
[1:20:43] especially for the brain because there's
[1:20:45] no other age
[1:20:48] we've got the ability to print this
[1:20:49] message and send it to the world that's
[1:20:51] why it's being done
[1:20:52] put it on a little bit
[1:20:55] and send it to somebody they got the
[1:20:56] whole 1100 sermon or something amen
[1:21:00] what a day you and i are living in let's
[1:21:01] stand again
