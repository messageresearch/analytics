[2:12] know brother Dale was talking about July
[2:13] 4th 1971 oh that was a long time ago
[2:17] that was I was born in 1975 so that you
[2:21] know brother Dale has been pastoring
[2:22] longer and I've even been living and I
[2:26] tell you what it's good - it's good to
[2:28] come to church where the ministries been
[2:31] around a little bit and knows what's
[2:34] going on a little bit so we appreciate
[2:35] brother Dale so much and and brother
[2:38] Wade also even though he's not here
[2:40] everything
[2:42] [Applause]
[2:46] so let's let's go ahead and turn to
[2:48] Hebrews 13:8 I just really just a couple
[2:51] verses to read and I think we've all we
[2:56] were all familiar with Hebrews 13:8
[2:57] that's the brother you know brother
[2:58] Graham said this is kind of like the
[3:00] hinge of the whole Bible everything just
[3:01] kind of hinges on this on this verse if
[3:05] you if we didn't have this verse then
[3:07] you can be Besant missing a lot you know
[3:10] with this verse we can be confident that
[3:12] the way that you approached him in the
[3:14] Old Testament the same way you
[3:16] approached him in the New Testament that
[3:17] he's unchangeable immutable as Paul said
[3:20] immutable means that there's no way to
[3:22] to change an add anything to it he's a
[3:24] constant and never never never changing
[3:28] so I want to take for a topic today that
[3:31] just just a little statement he is still
[3:34] the same today let's go the Lord in
[3:37] prayer Lord Jesus we're so grateful to
[3:40] be able to come together Lord Jesus and
[3:42] fellowship around your word and Lord God
[3:45] I believe Lord tonight and we'd come
[3:47] together with a purpose Lord that
[3:49] everyone this standing here ready to be
[3:52] seated or that you saw us all here
[3:55] gathered together before the foundation
[3:57] of the world and there's a purpose for
[3:58] us being together tonight Lord and I
[4:00] pray God that Lord that you'll come on
[4:03] the scene that that nothing will hinder
[4:04] our the purpose of this gathering Lord
[4:06] Jesus Lord I believe Lord that we all
[4:10] when we gather together we're we're come
[4:11] expecting we come desiring something
[4:14] from you Lord and my desire Lord is to
[4:17] be changed to not leave this place the
[4:19] same way that I came in and Lord I know
[4:22] that that's all of our desire Lord
[4:24] tonight and Lord Jesus I may be
[4:26] something that I can even be said that
[4:28] that'll help me even as I speak Lord and
[4:30] I pray Lord God we just open the doors
[4:33] of our heart as we've opened the door of
[4:35] this church Lord God to welcome one
[4:36] another and we welcome you Lord Jesus
[4:38] because Lord what kind of a service
[4:40] would it be if you weren't welcomed like
[4:43] like when Solomon dedicated the temple
[4:44] what kind of a temple would it have been
[4:46] if you hadn't to come and and took your
[4:49] abode in it Lord Jesus Lord as we come
[4:52] and brought brought all of our little
[4:53] licks of fire together Lord Jesus we
[4:55] know that you're here and I'm
[4:57] we know that you're a prison help in
[4:58] time of trouble and time of need we know
[5:01] Lord that you promised you never leave
[5:03] us or forsake us and so we have
[5:04] confidence Lord and Lord are you being
[5:06] the same yesterday today and forever
[5:08] that you're here with us now Lord God
[5:10] because you promised you would be Lord
[5:13] Jesus as we look into your word Lord of
[5:15] God I pray that you'll make it leap from
[5:16] the pages Lord Jesus into our heart into
[5:18] a new living reality Lord we pray we ask
[5:21] these things in trusting Lord Jesus that
[5:24] you'll bring it to pass and make this
[5:26] service profitable we pray in the name
[5:28] of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[5:32] let me shed my burden Hebrews 13:8 say
[5:44] is Jesus Christ the same yesterday and
[5:46] today and forever
[5:46] and then we'll go to Genesis 18 1 and it
[5:50] says and this is talking about Abraham
[5:53] when when God appeared to him there and
[5:56] it says and the Lord appeared unto him
[5:58] and the plains of Mamre and he sat in
[6:01] the tent door in the heat of the day you
[6:04] may be seated the Lord at his blessing
[6:06] to the reading other world Hebrews 13:8
[6:13] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[6:15] and forever he never changes any others
[6:18] there's really there's really three
[6:20] parts to that verse that I want to bring
[6:21] out tonight like I said it's a verse
[6:24] that we're all familiar and
[6:25] well-acquainted with and you know it
[6:27] signifies it that we should have
[6:29] confidence in God we should believe that
[6:31] he's the same that never-changing well
[6:34] there's there's three really three parts
[6:36] to that verse there's the yesterday and
[6:38] then today and forever
[6:41] and so I've situated this this next
[6:44] scripture that we're going to reads
[6:45] Genesis 81 where or Abraham is sitting
[6:47] there in the heat of the day and it's in
[6:49] front of his tent and it may be will
[6:51] situate him in the middle of that
[6:53] scripture and look at maybe it maybe if
[6:56] it was going to dramatize the scripture
[6:58] a little bit imagine just if you will
[7:00] imagine Abraham sitting there and the
[7:02] heat of the day outside of this tent and
[7:04] it looks like that nothing really is
[7:06] going on it is hot
[7:09] and maybe the dust of the camels all
[7:11] coming up and getting in his face and
[7:13] and his wife is inside getting getting
[7:16] the meal ready and everything getting
[7:18] going about her business and there's
[7:20] just Abraham sitting out in the heat of
[7:22] the day in front of the tent looks like
[7:25] nothing's going on and you know you
[7:27] could maybe look look at your own life
[7:29] look at the things that are happening
[7:30] around you it looks like it might look
[7:32] like to the observer that nothing is
[7:34] going on that nothing's you know that's
[7:37] how God does many times that he'll he'll
[7:39] wait he'll he'll let you that's why I
[7:41] believe we need patience right here is
[7:42] because sometimes it looks like
[7:44] nothing's going on but just hang around
[7:47] a little bit it looks like to everybody
[7:49] that that it's just a bunch of believers
[7:52] gathering together it's just some some
[7:55] man up behind the pulpit telling
[7:56] everybody how they should live or
[7:58] whatever and it looks like nothing
[7:59] nothing really is going on when there's
[8:02] a process taking place there's something
[8:04] going on and so I really want to just
[8:07] think this maybe is a little message of
[8:09] encouragement to you tonight to that
[8:11] that God is still the same yesterday
[8:14] today and forever and if he did
[8:15] something if he did something in the Old
[8:17] Testament you could look back to
[8:20] yesterday and trust that he's he's going
[8:23] to bring to pass his word if you if you
[8:26] go back into the Old Testament and see
[8:28] how God brought his words the ones that
[8:29] live back then and how they waited
[8:32] patiently and how they suffered with
[8:34] long suffering through all the things
[8:35] that they endured and how they they
[8:37] waited for God to bring his word to pass
[8:39] it and look today and see what God is
[8:42] doing because you know as he said
[8:45] they're in the heat of the day it looked
[8:47] like nothing was taking place but then
[8:49] all of a sudden all of a sudden
[8:52] something happened and you know if you
[8:55] read that story
[8:56] it wasn't like Abraham just looked up
[8:59] and he saw way off in the distance three
[9:02] men walking but it says he he looked up
[9:04] and they were right there beside him all
[9:06] of a sudden they were right there all of
[9:08] a sudden the son of man was right there
[9:10] on the scene and he can catch people
[9:12] unawares if they're not if they're not
[9:14] prepared if they're not keeping up with
[9:17] what God is doing if they're not in sync
[9:20] with their beat of
[9:21] this gospel drum so he said and he said
[9:26] in that he said in the tent door in the
[9:28] heat of the day watching for the coming
[9:31] of the Son of Man
[9:33] watching for something to transpire and
[9:36] he was about a hundred years old when
[9:38] this took place you know a lot of times
[9:40] usually we we kind of kind of put a lot
[9:43] of attention toward the young people and
[9:45] everything but maybe this this sermon
[9:47] will be towards a lot of the I'm not
[9:49] gonna say old but the mature ones in the
[9:51] gospel the mature ones in the gospel
[9:54] that have been around a while like yeah
[9:56] I don't think anybody here is reached
[9:58] Abraham's Asian four hundred years old
[10:00] but Abraham had gone through some things
[10:03] he had seen some things and he was he
[10:06] had gone through this process that we're
[10:08] going to talk about the devil a lot of
[10:10] times will try to tell you you'll say
[10:11] nothing's going on nothing's going on in
[10:14] your life and nothing's going on in your
[10:16] church God never did nothing for you a
[10:18] transformation taking place nothing's
[10:21] going on with the bride nothing's going
[10:22] on with there's no difference all these
[10:24] kind of things he'll tell you all these
[10:26] all these lies but you know you can our
[10:29] good response for the devil is remember
[10:32] a good response for yourself is remember
[10:35] remember where you came from remember
[10:37] where God has brought the bridegroom and
[10:40] a lot of times is so easy for us to
[10:42] forget it's so easy for us to forget
[10:45] what God I remember when I was growing
[10:46] up my my dad kept it a little notebook
[10:49] that he'd just over the years he just
[10:50] filled up and he kept writing in it God
[10:53] would do one thing God would do another
[10:54] thing like when my brother went in the
[10:56] hospital for a long time because the
[10:58] doctors couldn't tell what was wrong
[11:00] they and he was in the hospital get
[11:03] wasting away wasting away and he went
[11:05] before God and prayer and and began
[11:07] seeking God the doctors couldn't do
[11:09] anything all they could say was if
[11:12] something's wrong but I don't know what
[11:14] it is and and so he wrote this down in
[11:16] his book is it a little book of
[11:17] remembrance that when God came on the
[11:20] scene and delivered him and and and
[11:22] healed him brought forth the great
[11:24] deliverance he wrote it down it God God
[11:26] did it on such and such a day and he
[11:28] wrote he wrote it down so you can go
[11:29] back and look at that when we were in
[11:32] the car one day and we were
[11:33] around I had something on my face and
[11:35] and he began to pray in it the thing
[11:37] just fell off and you write it down in
[11:40] your little book and these are just
[11:42] things growing up but that we're
[11:44] remembering you and so you look back you
[11:47] can look back in your little book of if
[11:49] you wrote it down but you know think of
[11:52] it we all have things that we could
[11:54] remember of what God has done for you
[11:56] and you know the danger is that you
[11:58] almost you can forget so easily what God
[12:01] had done for you remember that if my
[12:05] wife or I look at her and say remember
[12:07] the time that when we first moved to
[12:09] Atlanta and we've got an apartment and
[12:11] then we bought a house and it looked
[12:13] like we were not going to be able to get
[12:14] out of that apartment because they had a
[12:16] they wouldn't let you out within the
[12:18] time period we had only been there a few
[12:20] months and it was time to move into the
[12:22] house and we just went to the lord god
[12:24] help us that everything will be smooth
[12:26] out we would be able to get out of the
[12:27] apartment and and lo and behold
[12:30] everything just smoothed out problems
[12:33] with the twins when Monica was pregnant
[12:35] just go to the Lord all the amniotic
[12:37] fluids bury them fairly they're just so
[12:39] many things that we could testify of
[12:40] that you forget so easily of what God
[12:43] has done for you and you you get into a
[12:47] state where you start your going along
[12:49] through the heat of the day and you
[12:50] begin to the devil can prey upon your
[12:52] mind and you start thinking well
[12:54] nothing's taking place but it's because
[12:56] you've forgotten the second Peter 3:1 he
[13:02] said this second epistle beloved I now
[13:04] write unto you and both which I stir up
[13:06] your minds by way of remembrance
[13:10] sometimes you need somebody to kind of
[13:12] stir up your mind a little bit and
[13:14] remember what God has done remember what
[13:16] was written in the Bible remember the
[13:18] promises that were written for you that
[13:21] you can lay ahold to I believe that's
[13:23] what the ministry is for that sometimes
[13:25] you know the ministry can almost almost
[13:27] put complexes on people but I I'm here
[13:30] tonight to take complexes off I'm here
[13:33] to I'm here to bring remembrance so that
[13:36] you realize what God is doing for you
[13:38] maybe take the veil off of your eyes and
[13:41] expose what what that God has been doing
[13:43] for you all down through your life
[13:46] and he said that you may be mindful of
[13:48] the words which were spoken before by
[13:51] the holy prophets another of the
[13:53] commandment of us the apostles of the
[13:55] Lord and Savior think about that that to
[13:58] stir up your minds to remembrance that
[14:01] you may be mindful of the words which
[14:03] were spoken before by the holy prophets
[14:05] and of the commandment of us the
[14:08] apostles of the Lord and Savior why why
[14:12] remember only these things because the
[14:14] things that were written the things that
[14:16] God spoke and the Old Testament and the
[14:18] new all through the Bible were meant to
[14:20] be profitable for you that were meant to
[14:23] loose you from your bondage we're meant
[14:25] to help you and it's good to be reminded
[14:28] of all the benefits that go along with
[14:29] being a Christian but you know there's
[14:32] benefits to being a Christian there's
[14:34] things that come along with that's what
[14:35] Psalm 103 said bless the Lord O my soul
[14:39] and forget forget not all his benefits
[14:42] who forgiveth all thine iniquities who
[14:46] healeth all thy diseases and it goes
[14:48] along and lists all these things because
[14:50] you know when you get a job or whatever
[14:52] you're interested in what the 401k plan
[14:55] looks like or what the benefit package
[14:56] looks like or what all of the things
[14:58] that go along with that are and
[15:00] sometimes we forget of the benefits that
[15:02] come along with being a Christian and
[15:04] one of the benefits says that he heals
[15:06] all your diseases you know when you go
[15:08] to the doctor and he tells you that
[15:10] there's no product like if they told my
[15:12] brother when he was when he was just a
[15:14] young fella there's nothing we can do
[15:16] there's nothing with there's no hope for
[15:18] you there's there's nothing at all that
[15:19] we can do don't forget that one of the
[15:22] benefits of being a Christian is that he
[15:24] heals all your diseases when they came
[15:26] to Jesus as he walked on the shores of
[15:28] Galilee as it was recorded in the New
[15:30] Testament when somebody would come to
[15:31] him by faith believing it's not recorded
[15:34] anywhere that he turned them away if you
[15:36] can come to God with that pure
[15:38] unadulterated face that impure that pure
[15:41] faith to just take him at his word
[15:44] he's honorbound it's it's got to happen
[15:47] but yet sometimes we forget sometimes we
[15:51] we kind of stumble it things like that
[15:55] who forgiveth all thine iniquities who
[15:58] forgiveth all the
[16:00] iniquities that's another benefit of
[16:02] being a Christian a benefit of being a
[16:04] Christian is that he for you can come to
[16:06] the Lord when when you've youyou think
[16:09] about what the definition of iniquity is
[16:11] that hits all of us because iniquity is
[16:14] when you know to do something but you
[16:15] don't do it or you don't you both ways
[16:18] you don't do it or you do do it if you
[16:22] if you don't do something that you
[16:24] should or you should do something that
[16:26] you don't and that hits all of us
[16:29] iniquity when you when you're not doing
[16:31] when you're not behaving the way that
[16:33] you should be an iniquity comes because
[16:35] you're not believing right and when you
[16:38] don't believe right because of unbelief
[16:40] then you have a way you have a benefit
[16:43] to come to God and ask for forgiveness
[16:45] God forgive me of this iniquity that's
[16:49] in me forgive me you think about what a
[16:52] great benefit that is think about what a
[16:55] great benefit that is when you're coming
[16:57] to God and you know there's something
[16:58] wrong in your life that you can just
[17:00] come to him and just ask him believing
[17:02] ask him with faith and he'll wipe the
[17:04] slate clean wipe it clean well yeah we
[17:08] forget about those kind of things
[17:10] and scripturally it seems like like a
[17:13] lot of times God is silent for a long
[17:15] while for a long time before anything
[17:18] happens before he begins to move you
[17:20] look at you look at all the ones in the
[17:22] Old Testament let me just run through a
[17:24] few stories and now now the first story
[17:27] is something where where God was kind of
[17:30] taking his time and looked like and that
[17:34] story of Adam and Eve but he's gonna
[17:36] bring forth he was gonna bring forth a
[17:38] child if they would have just held on
[17:40] and waited a little bit then he would
[17:42] have showed them the right way to bring
[17:44] forth children to multiply and replenish
[17:46] the earth but yet Eve even couldn't wait
[17:49] around patience she couldn't hang on for
[17:52] the right revelation and so even though
[17:55] it looked like God was taking a while if
[17:57] she would have just waited and
[17:58] everything would be all right
[18:00] what about Enoch that for three hundred
[18:03] and sixty-five years he walked with God
[18:05] three hundred and sixty-five years
[18:07] that's a long time longer than an
[18:10] Abraham
[18:11] a hundred years three hundred and
[18:13] sixty-five years and then all of a
[18:14] sudden he just stepped right off the
[18:16] earth all of a sudden he walked with God
[18:18] and was not found and no a hundred years
[18:21] and he worked on that Ark over a hundred
[18:24] years laboring on that art while
[18:26] everybody made fun of him and it looked
[18:27] like that was not even any rain up in
[18:29] the sky but then all of a sudden it
[18:31] began to rain all of a sudden the rain
[18:34] began to fall Moses for hundred years
[18:37] they the children of Israel wandered in
[18:39] the wilderness and then after Moses was
[18:41] born it was 40 years before God was able
[18:45] to get kind of get him in a way that he
[18:47] could he could even do anything for the
[18:49] Lord because he was running around
[18:50] trying to do it he wasn't equipped for
[18:52] the task he he tried to do things his
[18:55] own way and so they waited 400 years now
[18:59] going down in Egypt and in bondage and
[19:02] and what about Daniel after what it was
[19:05] a 68 years or so he began to look back
[19:09] into the scripture to see whether it was
[19:11] time for them to come out of bondage
[19:13] whether it was time to come out from
[19:15] Babylon after seven years he remembered
[19:18] that story - all of a sudden all of a
[19:21] sudden that one night the the men the
[19:24] armies of I forget who it was came in
[19:27] just after the handwriting on the wall
[19:29] and they took over they took over the
[19:31] land and immediately deliver us all of a
[19:34] sudden and then Jesus after 400 years of
[19:39] no prophets and nothing on the scene and
[19:41] then all of a sudden here comes John the
[19:44] Baptist a man that that nobody had even
[19:47] was probably even aware that he was in
[19:49] the wilderness eating locusts and wild
[19:51] honey after his parents had died and he
[19:54] was he ran off into the wilderness
[19:55] trying to do fend for himself and God
[19:58] began to speak to him and all of a
[19:59] sudden out of the wilderness he came and
[20:01] began to preach about things and make
[20:05] their way to the Lord straight and and
[20:07] then here comes Jesus on the scene
[20:09] though just the son of them the Son of
[20:11] Man on the scene all of a sudden all of
[20:16] a sudden you could by preach a sermon on
[20:17] that all of a sudden all of a sudden
[20:19] something happens and so many other
[20:23] stories of the
[20:24] of things that happen in the Old
[20:26] Testament were these these men went
[20:29] through trials and tribulations were
[20:31] delivered by the hand of God like Daniel
[20:34] and David the Bible says that he is
[20:37] still the same
[20:39] you know another story is that when they
[20:41] after the children of Israel after Moses
[20:43] delivered them over and the the Red Sea
[20:46] and they journeyed through the
[20:47] wilderness then Joshua took them over
[20:49] after they after they had come over the
[20:52] Jordan River then they build up twelve
[20:54] stones they made a little pyre of the
[20:57] twelve stones as a memorial to help them
[21:01] that came after that to remember that
[21:04] God had delivered some already and that
[21:07] God is able to deliver you that's what
[21:10] it really signifies and so when you look
[21:12] out of the lives and Christians fellow
[21:14] Christians and believers and look out of
[21:16] that how that God has delivered one
[21:18] another your life is a testimony that
[21:20] God is able to deliver you that he's
[21:23] able to deliver others as well and all
[21:26] these people that their stories became
[21:28] the Bible their stories they as they
[21:32] live their lives they their stories were
[21:34] written down so that you could look back
[21:35] and remember if God is able to deliver
[21:37] them he's able to deliver me also that's
[21:42] what John 14:26 says that the Holy Ghost
[21:45] would do is it's bringing things back to
[21:47] your remembrance just like Jesus on the
[21:49] day of Annie was walking down that met
[21:52] the ones walking on the on the road to
[21:55] Emmaus he he began to bring things back
[21:58] to their remembrance of what the Old
[21:59] Testament was testifying about the laws
[22:01] and the prophets and all these things
[22:03] they began to testify them and and bring
[22:06] things to their remembrance my like i-44
[22:11] says remember ye the law of Moses my
[22:13] servant which I commanded unto Him in
[22:16] Horeb for all Israel with the statues
[22:18] remember ye the law of Moses all these
[22:22] Redemption stories of the lost being
[22:24] found in the Bible to remember and you
[22:26] know one of the things that we often
[22:28] forget is all the things that were even
[22:30] done down through the seven church ages
[22:32] the stories that were told of of Martin
[22:34] with his great faith and and how he had
[22:37] you know you stood there and that they
[22:40] tied into that to that tree and began to
[22:43] hew on the tree and it fell over one way
[22:45] and it started to fall one way but then
[22:48] just God came on the scene and caused it
[22:51] to fall the other way and all these
[22:52] things that we know of the life of
[22:54] brother Branham the pillar of fire
[22:55] appearing and all these all these
[22:57] different things in Malachi 3:16 says
[23:02] then they that feared the Lord spake
[23:05] often one to another and the Lord
[23:06] hearkened and heard it and a book of
[23:09] remembrance was written before him for
[23:11] them that fear the Lord and that thought
[23:12] upon his name a book of remembers that
[23:15] God even like I was telling before about
[23:17] how that my dad he should write down in
[23:19] his little book the things that that God
[23:21] had done for him and here's God riding
[23:23] down on a book of remembers before him
[23:26] that of them that fear the Lord and that
[23:29] thought upon his name riding down so
[23:32] that he would remember and I believe we
[23:34] could look into that book of remembrance
[23:36] and and and get encouragement as we
[23:38] study the word we can see the read about
[23:42] the names of the ones that live before
[23:43] us and it and it helps build our faith
[23:46] one of the things that that God did for
[23:50] us to help build our faith is we in
[23:52] Isaiah
[23:53] I'm sorry Jeremiah 16:16 he says he sent
[23:56] he says behold I was sin for many
[23:58] fishers saith the Lord and they shall
[24:01] fish them he's talking about Israel how
[24:03] the Israel had been scattered and and in
[24:06] Jeremiah says that he was sin for many
[24:08] fishers saith the Lord and they shall
[24:09] fish them and after will I sin for many
[24:12] hunters and they shall hunt them from
[24:13] every mountain and from every land out
[24:16] of the holes of the rocks and I believe
[24:18] that these fissures that God's sending
[24:20] out our fishermen to fish you out from
[24:22] all the holes in the rocks the ones that
[24:25] are scattered hither and yon to bring
[24:27] them back into the boat of God's Word to
[24:30] bring them back to catch them with the
[24:32] word of God and bring them back and so
[24:35] that's what God says the fivefold
[24:37] ministry to encourage and to bring into
[24:40] our remembrance what God has already
[24:42] said you know youyou read all of these
[24:45] stories and things about what happened
[24:47] to brother bran
[24:48] what happened to our Aeneas and what
[24:50] happened to Martin and what happened to
[24:51] David and dang it'll all these ones and
[24:53] those are all good but what about your
[24:56] own story because every one of us has to
[24:58] have our own testimony of what God has
[25:00] done so that we could remember and look
[25:02] back what God has done for us and I
[25:05] believe what these three fish these
[25:06] fishermen are taking us pull through is
[25:09] they they cast that that hook out
[25:11] they cast that lure out and when you
[25:14] bite it then God begins to pull you back
[25:17] pull you back to his word that's what
[25:20] brother Branham did he cast that that
[25:22] gospel that that hook out there you know
[25:26] when you when you when you took a bite
[25:28] of that hook being that rainbow trout
[25:30] that he talked about it probably didn't
[25:31] even really understand what you were
[25:33] biting it seemed like I know I didn't
[25:35] seem like it's kind of almost a new
[25:38] thing strange thing and you take a bite
[25:40] out of that and you know cuz he bit he
[25:44] baited the hook with it with signs and
[25:46] wonders and discernment and all those
[25:48] things and he didn't quite understand
[25:50] what what it was about but yet
[25:53] nevertheless you were hooked and he
[25:55] begins pulling you through through one
[25:58] two three pulling you through a three
[26:00] pool journey of your own transformative
[26:04] experience and I believe that's the
[26:06] experience that every believer goes
[26:08] through that's that every believer goes
[26:11] through an experience you know pray for
[26:16] Mack never was gonna attack my throat
[26:18] all of a sudden don't don't be doing
[26:20] that I believe that every born-again
[26:24] believer gets an experience that God
[26:26] takes them through so and that's the
[26:29] experience that brother Brown talked
[26:30] about that every believer has have an
[26:32] experience you know sometimes we look at
[26:34] an experience as a little sensation or a
[26:36] little emotion or whatever jumping
[26:38] around and all those kind of things with
[26:40] experience I'm talking about tonight is
[26:42] experience where you can look back and
[26:44] see where you once were and then look
[26:46] and look and see where you are now and
[26:48] then look ahead and see where you're
[26:49] going because in the end the book of
[26:51] John it says that he'll bring things do
[26:53] you remember it and it'll show you
[26:54] things to come he'll show you your
[26:56] current condition he can show you where
[27:00] you are and the statue of a perfect
[27:02] man he could show you where you are
[27:03] positionally in Christ and I believe
[27:06] that's what the gospel is doing today by
[27:07] those by the by the preaching of the
[27:09] word by the preaching of those those
[27:11] fishermen underneath that the great
[27:14] fisherman of the age who who cast the
[27:17] gospel net and then the fishermen under
[27:19] him began to catch though the word the
[27:22] message that's been preached and and
[27:24] toss out the hooks to catch the
[27:26] believers so let's look I want to kind
[27:36] of take take you through Abraham's
[27:38] journey as he went through really all
[27:41] these three pulls and and so you start
[27:45] off his journey and journey in Genesis
[27:47] chapter 12 where it says that now the
[27:50] Lord had said unto Abram and get thee
[27:54] out of thy country and from thy kindred
[27:56] and from thy father's house unto a land
[28:00] that I will show thee and I will make of
[28:03] thee a great nation and I will bless
[28:07] thee and make thy name great and thou
[28:09] shalt be a blessing and I will bless
[28:11] them that bless thee and curse him that
[28:13] curseth thee and in thee shall all
[28:14] families of the earth be blessed
[28:18] youyou think about you think about what
[28:20] Abraham his first pool would be when he
[28:23] down there or up there rather if you
[28:26] look at the map up there and the Fertile
[28:27] Crescent after after go back even a
[28:31] little bit further than that after Noah
[28:32] came off the ark all the people gathered
[28:35] around that same area and they begin to
[28:37] one thing led to another and began to
[28:39] put up the Tower of Babel and all those
[28:42] different things and then God confounded
[28:43] their speech and and then so Abraham was
[28:47] the ones that had lived his grandfather
[28:49] and maybe his father also they were all
[28:51] out of worshippers so for Abraham to
[28:54] leave aside all those idols and things
[28:56] and and change his direction and go
[28:58] after God it would take a kind of you
[29:02] know you know he would have had to - bit
[29:05] the hook bit that gospel hook so to
[29:07] speak you know brother Brown tells us
[29:10] tells a little story in in the faith is
[29:13] our victory said Abraham
[29:15] I think this is this should be number
[29:17] three but I left off the number three so
[29:19] it's numbered wrong brothers but it's
[29:21] the third one the third quote he said
[29:23] Abraham just a man with no certain
[29:25] purpose in life just with his father and
[29:27] his friends coming down from Babylon
[29:29] they settled in Shinar and there they
[29:31] had the tower built and so forth and one
[29:34] day while Abraham was praying no doubt
[29:36] he prayed through till he struck the
[29:38] hand of God but how did he do it by
[29:40] faith how did he do it he he just
[29:43] believed God and he said perhaps he
[29:46] thought like this if there is a God who
[29:47] made the Ark and letting know if look
[29:49] through he still lives today that's
[29:52] really what I'm preaching tonight is
[29:54] look look what I how I came he looked at
[29:56] the lives of these that had gone on
[29:58] before he remembered about Noah and he
[30:01] remembered all the ones that about how
[30:03] Noah had been made the ark and how he
[30:05] had delivered him and he said he's got
[30:07] to still be Hebrews 13:8 he's got to be
[30:10] he's got to still live today of course
[30:13] you know Hebrews 13:8 wasn't written yet
[30:15] but it's still applied because he's
[30:17] Hebrews 13:8 somewhere in the land of
[30:21] heathens where he was a sojourner he
[30:23] touched the hand of God and in there God
[30:26] gave him a revelation that there was a
[30:27] city whose builder and maker was God so
[30:31] there I just want to pause for a second
[30:32] and give you a little illustration and
[30:34] what the real evidence of the new birth
[30:36] is because right there something struck
[30:38] him that he saw a part of God he saw
[30:41] who-who God what there's got to be God
[30:44] and there's got to be a city you think
[30:47] about what a great revelation that would
[30:48] be framing him down in a land of idols
[30:51] and and even he began to walk after that
[30:54] city he began to date one foot after the
[30:57] other one step and you know if you look
[30:59] on a map it is hundreds of miles from
[31:02] where he started his journey in the
[31:03] earth County all the way down to Israel
[31:06] all the way down to the Palestinian area
[31:08] that the land the promised land and so
[31:11] he had to walk a long way and it was a
[31:14] long journey before all of a sudden
[31:17] Genesis 18 one was fulfilled he had to
[31:20] be a really patient but you know you
[31:22] think about what is the evidence of the
[31:24] new birth was there it was there any
[31:25] sensation was there any emotion I'm sure
[31:28] there was a lot
[31:29] motions and things you know one thing
[31:31] when you get the new Bertha it will
[31:32] cause a stimulation and I believe the
[31:34] stimulation that was causing Abraham his
[31:36] life was he put his foot out and he
[31:38] began to walk that's what the
[31:40] stimulation in your life is that you
[31:42] begin to walk the gospel walk it might
[31:45] not be apparent on the outside so much
[31:47] so sometimes it might be but it'll start
[31:49] causing you that virtue will start
[31:51] causing you to have knowledge because
[31:53] that'll stimulate your lot your life to
[31:55] produce the fruits and the gospel
[31:57] because God is working in you and so the
[32:01] what is the evidence of the new birth
[32:03] brother Branham explained that or you
[32:05] know many different ways that what the
[32:07] evidence is but one of the primary
[32:09] evidences is that you will hear the word
[32:11] because in John 5:24 says verily verily
[32:15] I say unto you he that heareth my word
[32:17] and believeth on him that sent me hath
[32:19] everlasting life and shall not come into
[32:21] condemnation but it's passed from death
[32:23] in the life and you know the brother
[32:25] Branham explained that he that believeth
[32:27] believe it is to understand and I think
[32:30] that's one of the biggest confusions and
[32:31] the message today that is you can just
[32:33] come to church and sit there on a pew
[32:35] and warm it warm that pew up and not
[32:38] understand a thing that's going on I
[32:40] have any kind of idea what's going on
[32:42] but when you get the new birth the word
[32:44] will begin to open up to you you know
[32:47] you think about how much the world
[32:49] opened up to Abraham right there when he
[32:51] to realize that God a new City was
[32:55] coming down the gada that this is not my
[32:57] home this is not my home it's it's my
[33:00] earth all right it's my earth but this
[33:02] is not my home but God is gonna clean it
[33:04] up he's gonna cleanse this place with
[33:06] fire and he's gonna he's gonna cleanse
[33:09] it off with water like he did in the day
[33:11] of Noah he's cleaned it off with the
[33:13] blood of Christ when he died on the
[33:14] cross and nany now he's gonna burn it
[33:17] off and bring down a new city so that we
[33:19] can live you talk about a revelation
[33:21] that's a revelation of who Jesus Christ
[33:23] is so if you're sitting in church and/or
[33:25] everything's confusing everybody just
[33:28] keep eating the word because what else
[33:32] can you do right I'm John 443 says why
[33:36] do you not understand my speech even
[33:39] because you cannot hear my word why you
[33:41] understand me because you don't have
[33:43] hearing hearing comes by the baptism of
[33:46] the Holy Ghost because the baptism in
[33:48] the Holy Ghost is the revelation of
[33:49] Jesus Christ personally to you it is the
[33:52] revelation after you have after the way
[33:54] has been cleared by being justified
[33:56] after all of your sin has been forgiven
[33:58] I've chopped off after the hall that
[34:00] little old life has been cleared out so
[34:03] that God has a way to step in and you
[34:05] know that's what's different between be
[34:07] before you're born again and after
[34:09] before you're born again God's trying to
[34:11] wait find a way to get in and after your
[34:14] morning and he's trying to find a way to
[34:16] get out and that's where the greatest
[34:18] battle ever fought is it's right there
[34:20] in that spirit room before you're born
[34:22] again he's trying to get through through
[34:24] all that all that clogged up flus of
[34:26] memories and consciousness affection
[34:28] what do you think we'll look at this one
[34:30] over here they they got it this way
[34:32] maybe I got to come exactly that way and
[34:34] you got to get through all of that and
[34:37] he and the way he blasts those flus
[34:39] openings by the word by the revealing of
[34:41] the word and finally he gets in there
[34:43] and that baby's born and he begins to
[34:45] live in you and be consumed come out
[34:47] through the statute of a perfect man
[34:50] through the opening of the word John
[34:53] 14:26 says but the comforter which is
[34:55] the Holy Ghost whom the father will send
[34:57] in my name he shall teach you all things
[34:59] and bring all things work to your
[35:02] remembrance so you remember what he says
[35:04] so you remember what the prophets said
[35:06] so you remember and encouraged by the
[35:08] scriptures so you remember what your
[35:10] benefits are so you remember what kind
[35:12] of person you are what kind of person he
[35:15] is and you know your day in the hour you
[35:17] recognize your day and its message
[35:20] whatsoever I have said unto you he said
[35:23] he'll teach you all things and bring all
[35:25] things to your remembrance now if he's
[35:28] the teacher then you and you're a good
[35:31] pupil you're a good student then the
[35:33] world will be opening up to you little
[35:35] by little it'll be opening up to you he
[35:39] said behold I stand at the door and
[35:41] knock in revelation 3:20 If any man hear
[35:44] my voice and open the door I will come
[35:45] in to him and will sup with him and he
[35:48] with me and sup sup is eaten
[35:52] one with another think about that he's
[35:54] eating he's willing to come in the door
[35:56] of your heart and eat with you and while
[35:59] you're eating any anybody knows when you
[36:01] go eat with somebody when you eat with
[36:03] your friend you begin to tell them about
[36:05] things tell them about your life tell
[36:06] them about what's going on what your
[36:08] family's doing and that's the same thing
[36:10] that God does when he comes and subs
[36:12] with you and as communion with you
[36:13] one-to-one he tells you about himself
[36:16] and he begins to commune with you and
[36:17] open up the word to you and so that's
[36:20] exactly what happened to Abraham when he
[36:22] was when he was going through a type of
[36:25] justification and I'm not speaking
[36:27] really a baby form justification but I'm
[36:29] talking about the justification of the
[36:31] soul whether it's who can hold anything
[36:33] to the charge of God's elect who can
[36:35] hold it went up into a born-again
[36:37] believer who can come up against the
[36:38] born-again believer and say in your soul
[36:41] there's something wrong there's
[36:42] something amiss because you've been
[36:44] redeemed and by the opening of the word
[36:47] by the revelation that God has given you
[36:49] his purged you and brought his self to
[36:51] life inside of you put his own life in
[36:54] you Ephesians 378 says that Christ may
[36:57] dwell in your hearts by faith that ye
[37:01] being rooted rooted and grounded in love
[37:03] that he may dwell in your hearts by
[37:06] faith Romans 5:12 says therefore being
[37:10] justified by faith we have peace with
[37:13] God through our Lord Jesus Christ by
[37:15] whom also we have access by faith into
[37:17] this grace wherein we stand and rejoice
[37:20] in hope of the glory of God how it was
[37:22] justified by faith by believing on him
[37:25] how are we how do we have access to him
[37:27] by faith by just believing on here in
[37:29] him and taking him at his word and
[37:31] that's something you could you can
[37:33] barely even talk about unless you've
[37:35] experienced it but when you've
[37:36] experienced God it's almost like a
[37:39] Tetris game if you've ever played Tetris
[37:41] see when you're trying to get the little
[37:42] blocks to line up to line up in the
[37:44] right way and when you believe God and
[37:47] say I once was wrong but now I believe
[37:50] this has got to be it and it's true that
[37:53] Tetris block the other word will blood
[37:56] drop right down into your heart and it
[37:59] will change you it would change your
[38:00] being
[38:01] make you a new creature in Christ Jesus
[38:03] that's why that statue of a perfect man
[38:06] brother Brent talked about how that
[38:07] those blocks you couldn't even fit a
[38:09] razor edge between them they all fit
[38:11] together so perfectly to the there's
[38:13] nothing between everything and how do
[38:15] those blocks get that way they got that
[38:18] away by faith by you believing you
[38:21] believe the Word of God and they just
[38:22] dropped down into it permanently slot
[38:25] dropped right in exactly the way it
[38:28] should be and that's how the Christian
[38:30] journey is you just believe God and keep
[38:32] walking how can how can you walk without
[38:36] a revelation
[38:37] how could Abraham walk toward that city
[38:40] whose builder and maker is God if he
[38:44] didn't have a revelation and there was
[38:45] such a thing how do you even know how to
[38:48] walk how do you know how to be a
[38:49] Christian how do you know what the
[38:51] message is about without a revelation
[38:52] that's what we should be seeking for and
[38:57] I want to stress this not who felt he
[38:58] met Abraham could fail all kind of
[39:00] things but they're in the end Genesis
[39:02] chapter 18 he was sitting there in the
[39:05] heat of the day and I bet he felt tired
[39:07] I felt worn out he'd been a lot walking
[39:10] a long time he was a hundred years old
[39:12] just about feeling didn't matter so much
[39:16] to him but yet you're like brother Brian
[39:19] kept talking about how he was lacing
[39:20] those booties he had that all the little
[39:23] baby equipment ready because he believed
[39:25] it wasn't the feeling that had him
[39:27] walking it was the believing you know if
[39:31] I could if I could quote itami I was
[39:33] born out and Tommy Osbourne said it that
[39:35] God took the easy part over the hard
[39:37] part God took the hard part it gave you
[39:41] the easy part think about that you don't
[39:48] have to manufacture nothing you don't
[39:50] have to produce nothing you're looking
[39:53] at the statue perfect man you think that
[39:55] looks hard how am I going to do that you
[39:58] don't have to produce it all you have to
[40:01] do is believe it and God will do the
[40:03] rest you know it you know there's a lot
[40:07] of people today a lot of ministers
[40:09] around the world preaching hot preaching
[40:11] all that what women are supposed to do
[40:12] and we
[40:13] to do the dish and washing this this one
[40:16] kind of way and all this kind of stuff
[40:17] but I'm I'm a preacher a little
[40:18] something different night I'm a preacher
[40:20] than a spiritual bride a spiritual bride
[40:23] don't have to do nothing but show up to
[40:25] the wedding and she needs to show up to
[40:27] the wedding dressed in white she needs
[40:29] to show up clothes right so that with
[40:32] with the old man dead so there's nothing
[40:35] to impede the wedding but also you got
[40:37] to do it show up to that wedding like
[40:39] that story there brother Brown told
[40:40] about the waiting for the groom did the
[40:43] little the little bride waiting for the
[40:44] groom to show up on the book board book
[40:46] board and and one day he showed up so
[40:49] what was she knew she wasn't struggling
[40:51] and fussing and fighting and struggling
[40:53] with herself you know and and maybe you
[40:56] know Oh God you know all this just
[40:58] trying to trying to push it out but you
[41:01] know and the natural and the natural let
[41:04] me be carnal for a second so just bear
[41:06] with me but in the natural a baby is
[41:08] born by pushing the Midwife tells you to
[41:10] push the doctor tells you to push but
[41:12] this gospel baby is not going to be born
[41:14] by pushing it's born by the head pulling
[41:17] the heads pulling you were drawing you
[41:19] up so you don't have to push in fuss and
[41:23] Feud and everything with yourself or
[41:25] with God or whatever just relax and
[41:27] that's the problem when when you get
[41:29] hooked when the fisherman car tosses the
[41:31] hook out well what's the natural
[41:33] inclination of a fish the natural
[41:35] inclination of a fish's to this tougher
[41:37] to fight and run away and try to get
[41:40] away you know what God does is he just
[41:42] lay just wait for you to get tired out
[41:44] you're under this church over here you
[41:47] run to this church over here you run to
[41:48] this doctrine over here but after a
[41:50] while you come back to dead center and
[41:52] he's just waiting for you to get worn
[41:54] out and wait for you to come back to
[41:55] center line that's that's the problem
[41:59] with a fresh-caught gospel gospel trial
[42:02] as that thing they gotta they think they
[42:05] got to do all kind of stuff instead of
[42:07] just relax it and give it in relax and
[42:10] let the let the fish them and draw you
[42:11] into the boat you know talking about
[42:20] faith oh how can you stand I'll give you
[42:23] our faith brother I'm preaching the
[42:25] message perfect faith
[42:26] you have faith if there's something in
[42:29] the way so before you can have faith you
[42:31] got to have forgiveness if your heart
[42:34] condemns you you can't get what you're
[42:36] asking for if your heart condemns you
[42:39] you can't have faith so god can't move
[42:41] until you repent and that's why it's so
[42:44] important to repent and get everything
[42:46] out of the way that's why it's so
[42:48] important to confess your faults one to
[42:49] another because of you if you're holding
[42:51] grudges against one another and
[42:53] accumulating things against one another
[42:55] instead of accumulating the word then
[42:58] then there's something impeding your
[42:59] faith how can you have pure faith if
[43:02] there's something in the way go to your
[43:04] brother and ask for forgiveness
[43:06] say I've done something wrong and then
[43:09] you know when you have and when
[43:10] everything's clear when everything's out
[43:13] of the way and you can say within your
[43:14] heart that I don't have it there's no
[43:16] condemnation there's nothing in the way
[43:19] that you can have confidence when you
[43:21] approach God that's the way to have
[43:23] faith is you get everything out of the
[43:25] way and you said God forgive me people
[43:27] forgive me all of my acquaintances all
[43:30] of my family forgive me you know that's
[43:32] how you get the new birth to that's part
[43:34] of sanctification that's sanctify the
[43:36] walkers when you go around something
[43:38] within you is it's burning to get
[43:40] everything out of way so that you can
[43:41] have faith and God can come in get it
[43:44] all out of the way so that God can come
[43:46] in and you can have perfect faith and
[43:47] then you're a well on the way to being
[43:50] pulled in the boat you see where I'm
[43:55] going with three pools what's what's the
[43:57] third pool the third pole is to get you
[44:00] back in the boat and who's in the boat
[44:02] Jesus Christ to get you back into the
[44:06] boat where it from from where you came
[44:08] from because we know that brother
[44:11] brother Dale's brother Wade preached on
[44:13] Genesis 1:26 27 all these times Jesus
[44:17] talked about how he knew where he come
[44:18] from and John 17 he talked about the
[44:20] glory and and and he spoke about from
[44:24] glory to to oneness it's really what he
[44:26] was preaching on I know where I came
[44:27] from and I know where I'm going I know
[44:29] I'm going to perfect oneness and we know
[44:32] where we came from and we know where
[44:33] we're going if you've got the batteries
[44:35] in the Holy Ghost you came from God
[44:37] you're going back to God just like Jesus
[44:39] said I come from God I'm going back to
[44:41] God and you're going back to come out
[44:43] because you're doing being drawn back
[44:44] into the boat through those that 3 pool
[44:47] journey is God's Word is pulling you
[44:49] back into the boat so so Abraham started
[44:57] out in the city of Ur started out in
[45:00] Babylon started out by throwing down his
[45:02] idols started out by throwing out all
[45:05] that he's you know really you would say
[45:07] I used to believe that but something has
[45:10] happened to me and I don't believe that
[45:12] no more that's you know what it's such
[45:16] as such a strange thing for many people
[45:18] to grab a hold of that the opening of
[45:21] the word is going to take us out of here
[45:23] I was talking to somebody about that
[45:25] recently and they and they began to say
[45:27] well you do you mean to tell me that it
[45:30] sounds like almost like you're saying
[45:31] it's knowledge that you just accumulate
[45:34] knowledge no but what it is see God this
[45:38] kind of knowledge can't come just from
[45:40] study and like you're in a school
[45:41] setting or whatever but this kind of
[45:44] knowledge is when that that block drops
[45:46] into the slot and it begins to change
[45:49] your life and so that's what the
[45:51] experience I'm talking about how can you
[45:54] even approach to explain something like
[45:56] that unless you've lived it unless
[45:58] you've gone through it it seems Fanta
[46:01] funded fantastical to imagine that
[46:03] believing God's Word would produce him
[46:06] inside of you inside of you that allow
[46:08] him to tabernacle himself inside of your
[46:11] members that he would use your hands and
[46:13] use your feet and then you can yield
[46:15] yourself by just accumulating to
[46:18] yourself the word by studying and
[46:20] reading it and that would allow God to
[46:23] Tabernacle himself inside of you but yet
[46:26] it's true and so the next stage of
[46:28] Abraham's journey was there in Genesis
[46:31] 15 and I'm just preaching this and my
[46:34] time is Bob oh goodness that clock one
[46:39] day will be an eternity but for now we
[46:41] live we're living in two bound by time
[46:44] but in Genesis chapter 15 the next stage
[46:48] of his journey was what
[46:50] that person stays the same defied life
[46:53] and again I'm not talking about baby
[46:55] form sanctification but I'm talking
[46:57] about sanctification work you know if
[46:59] you look at the fare of the life of the
[47:01] Pharisees they didn't have you know all
[47:03] kind of they weren't going out and
[47:04] drinking alcohol and doing all that kind
[47:06] of stuff that's a lot of times we think
[47:09] that's what sanctification is that's
[47:11] that's part of it
[47:12] because when you when you're on your way
[47:13] to the new birth then all that alcohol
[47:16] drinking alcohol and smoking cigarettes
[47:18] and and and and looking at pornography
[47:21] and doing things and probably you
[47:22] shouldn't be doing and doing stuff in
[47:24] secret cheating on you why let me tell
[47:26] you something if you got the baptism in
[47:28] the Holy Ghost you ain't gonna be
[47:29] running around on your wife around on
[47:31] your husband I'll tell you that right
[47:32] now you ain't gonna be doing the less
[47:34] stuff because that stuff goes down as
[47:35] sanctification which it seems like today
[47:39] there's a lot of confusion about whether
[47:40] it can somebody be born again and beats
[47:43] going around and cheating on their wife
[47:45] or something they'll hug the baptism the
[47:47] Holy Ghost that revelation that's inside
[47:48] of you if you've got the new birth
[47:50] that'll keep you from doing that that's
[47:53] that's just a bunch of nonsense and a
[47:55] bunch of trash to imagine if somebody
[47:57] could sit in church and say well I I'm
[47:59] alright to be sleeping around or
[48:01] whatever all that stuff goes out at the
[48:03] new birth all that stuff goes out of
[48:05] sanctification because God's cleaning
[48:07] you up it's cleaning you up so that you
[48:09] can be alone with nobody else knowing
[48:11] what's going on and you've been living
[48:13] the clean life because God God has
[48:15] cleaned you out but in this and this
[48:19] mature sanctification God begins to
[48:21] clean you out by the word so that you're
[48:24] not just just living that kind of a life
[48:26] right but now God's life the divine life
[48:30] is being formed in you so that when
[48:32] somebody looks at you even when you look
[48:34] at your own self you could say look
[48:35] there's no way that I could do that when
[48:38] I myself that had somebody slap you
[48:40] across the face as many of you have
[48:41] testified and you just turn with
[48:43] temperance temperance because God is in
[48:46] control temperance is when God something
[48:48] down the inside is in control it's not
[48:50] you patience where you're waiting on God
[48:53] not maybe not like he or she had to jump
[48:56] and try to jump to conclusions of things
[48:58] but you were waiting patiently for God
[49:00] to fulfill his word and you
[49:01] when that when all that begins today is
[49:04] making away
[49:05] excuse me how does this happen how does
[49:10] this happen because you were eating the
[49:12] word you're feeding on the word and what
[49:15] it happens is the mechanics that you're
[49:17] feeding on the mechanics make a way for
[49:20] the dynamics that's what the mechanics
[49:22] does but it seems like today a lot of
[49:24] people shy away from the mechanics they
[49:26] want the dynamics more than the
[49:28] mechanics but it's the mechanics that
[49:30] brings the dynamics if you want to have
[49:32] dynamics in your life get the mechanics
[49:34] first because if you don't have the
[49:36] mechanics there's nothing to quicken
[49:40] y'all pray for mama see the devils start
[49:44] battling my throat with that saw her how
[49:48] you know I'm reminded of that little
[49:49] story where brother Brown talked about
[49:52] the little chipmunk that was harassing
[49:53] the eagle they just kept chitter chatter
[49:55] and chitter chatter and you know you
[49:57] know brother Brown said that looks like
[49:58] the devil he'll just keep chitter
[49:59] chatter and trying to end tag and I try
[50:02] and do stuff but you know brother Brown
[50:03] if you read that quote he said he looked
[50:06] at that squirrel saying you ain't gonna
[50:07] do nothing so you don't you don't have
[50:15] to how do you get these virtues you
[50:17] don't have to press you don't have to
[50:20] frustrate your way into it that's how a
[50:24] lot of us think remember that story
[50:26] brother round talked about how Paul
[50:27] Rader Paul Rader told the story of how
[50:30] he had that dream and he he he in the
[50:34] dream his boss told him go cut that in
[50:36] that big old tree and he went and
[50:38] chopped on that tree until he fell over
[50:40] and he tried to pick it up and it began
[50:42] just struggle with it and he began to to
[50:45] realize there's no way I can pick this
[50:46] tree huh there's no way I can get this
[50:49] thing up and that's almost how it looks
[50:51] like when you look at something like
[50:52] this how how can I get this tree up how
[50:55] can I you know you remember about the
[50:58] word of the Lord is the ruble was I'll
[50:59] make this mountain flat I'll make it a
[51:01] plane I'll make it so you can you can do
[51:04] something with it and so so in the dream
[51:07] and the dream he heard a voice is just
[51:13] chop it down and
[51:14] there's a river right next to it they
[51:17] just just roll it over into the river
[51:19] and before long he was screaming I'm
[51:21] riding on it I'm riding on they like
[51:23] like those uh you've seen how in the old
[51:26] times when they log meals they would
[51:28] chop trees down and roll it over in the
[51:31] river and they would ride on it and so
[51:33] you know if you what it is is if you
[51:35] just give it over to God and put that
[51:38] burden down on the river put that
[51:40] whatever it is in the river how am I
[51:42] going to get over how am I going to get
[51:43] up the statue of a perfect man just give
[51:46] it over to God and before long you'll be
[51:48] riding on his promises before long
[51:51] you'll be riding oh you know so if you
[51:56] go if you go out of the barn Lord and
[51:58] look at a sheep he's not struggling to
[52:01] produce wool and maybe right after you
[52:03] you share it you might go to that sheep
[52:05] and say it's the heat of the day I don't
[52:07] see any wool on you and that she might
[52:09] say well just come back in the mother so
[52:11] just be patient and hang around a little
[52:14] bit and he might tell you that while
[52:15] he's just munching on some grass just
[52:18] sitting there lounging
[52:19] munching on some grass because let me
[52:22] tell you something that's how you grow
[52:23] that's how you grow as a Christian is
[52:26] all you got to do is just keep eating
[52:28] all that sheep has to do to bear wool
[52:30] let's just keep eating and all you've
[52:32] got to do is just keep eating a zebra
[52:34] has stripes why because that's in his
[52:36] genes he just keeps eating oh you don't
[52:39] have to do nothing to produce her
[52:40] stripes all he has to do is just keep
[52:42] munching what take any animal there is
[52:44] well as the giraffe got a long neck
[52:46] because it's in his genes and he eats
[52:48] and he just keeps munching and that'll
[52:51] produce because listen if you get the
[52:53] new birth it'll connect you right back
[52:56] with the genes of God which is what this
[52:58] statue for perfect man is and the more
[53:00] you eat the more the genes are expressed
[53:03] until it looks just like your father you
[53:06] look just like your father you think
[53:14] about all these all these struggles that
[53:16] Abraham endured that he was being purged
[53:18] and everything is being going from this
[53:20] way to that you know look at all the
[53:24] different mistakes that Abraham made as
[53:26] he was he had
[53:27] hooking his mouth but he went this way
[53:30] over here telling Abimelech that this is
[53:32] my sister and he went this way over here
[53:35] telling okay I'll you know try to have a
[53:39] child with Hagar and he went this way
[53:41] over here from one thing to another
[53:43] but finally God took him through his
[53:45] journey with that that he had that hook
[53:47] in his mouth
[53:48] if God's got that hook in his mouth he
[53:50] ain't gonna lose you you know I want to
[53:57] encourage you tonight that you're here
[53:58] for a reason you ain't you ain't here
[54:01] just for playing around I believe that
[54:03] everybody here tonight at least has a
[54:05] hook in their mouth if you say that's a
[54:08] dangerous way to say it brother brother
[54:11] ball that but I believe there's a reason
[54:13] that you're here that God you've heard
[54:15] the gospel call and you've you've done
[54:17] something with it something struck your
[54:20] heart and you've you're your own the way
[54:22] to that third pool you're on the way in
[54:25] the end what you have to do is just keep
[54:28] on believing and keep on eating and then
[54:34] Abraham finally got to Genesis 17 and
[54:39] when Abraham was ninety years old and
[54:41] nine the Lord appeared to Abraham to
[54:45] Abram Abram his name one changed you and
[54:48] said unto him I am the Almighty God walk
[54:52] before me and beat out perfect you know
[54:58] what's important to notice right here
[55:01] Abraham started his journey walking and
[55:03] the middle he was walking and here he
[55:07] was still supposed to be walking he
[55:10] didn't stop walking just because he got
[55:13] to walk before me and be thou perfect he
[55:17] can't walk at home because there was a
[55:19] few more things left to come oh good I
[55:24] got so many more notes slow down keep
[55:31] walking walk he walking when you come
[55:34] all the way up the statue be perfect man
[55:37] see I'm still talking
[55:38] I'm still on yesterday we're looking
[55:40] back at you
[55:41] if you look back at your life at
[55:43] yesterday yesterday you that hook got in
[55:46] your mouth
[55:46] yesterday you your life beginning to be
[55:49] pursed yesterday and now now it's
[55:54] Adoption time sealed by the baptism the
[56:02] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[56:03] what is the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[56:05] since the revelation of Jesus Christ
[56:06] personally you to you as you keep
[56:09] walking and walking that that that the
[56:12] Holy Ghost is dwelling within you is
[56:15] revealing the word to you and sealing
[56:18] these virtues in and you just keep
[56:20] walking and believing and now it's
[56:23] Adoption time let me let me pause for a
[56:26] second here you know just take a moment
[56:29] and maybe when you're driving home
[56:30] tonight take a moment to reflect upon
[56:33] your life because listen it's so easy
[56:35] today to say nothing's happening you
[56:39] know you can go out and look at the
[56:40] ocean and and it looks like nothing's
[56:43] happening but yet thousands and millions
[56:45] of gallons of water are being moved up
[56:48] into the atmosphere and it looks like it
[56:50] looked like nothing was happening when
[56:52] in the heat of the day when Abraham was
[56:54] sitting outside of his tent it looked
[56:56] like maybe nothing's happening all down
[56:59] through the seven churches as as people
[57:01] are being killed and martyred and all
[57:05] these different things and you come up
[57:06] to the end time and brother Branham
[57:08] preached his message and and now it
[57:10] looks like everybody in the message
[57:12] disagreed for a while that's what
[57:14] somebody told me is that how do I know
[57:16] what's church to go to how it seems like
[57:18] everybody's disagreeing but yet
[57:20] something's happening it might look like
[57:22] a lot of confusion but yet something's
[57:24] happening and all of a sudden that
[57:27] something will happen when you least
[57:29] expect it that's why he said beware be
[57:31] watchful because our cup the son of man
[57:34] will come as a thief in the night when
[57:36] you least expect it they'll be two in
[57:38] the bed and want to be taken and want to
[57:39] be left they'll be one of the two in the
[57:41] field won't be taken one will be left
[57:42] why because it's all of a sudden
[57:44] something's been happening all this time
[57:47] and many don't realize it and they miss
[57:50] what's happening
[57:51] oh I'm gonna skip over a lot in my notes
[57:54] come on now Genesis 18 is where where we
[58:01] left off with Abraham and he said and
[58:03] the Lord appeared unto him in the plains
[58:04] of Mamre and he said in the tent door in
[58:07] the heat of the day and he lift up his
[58:09] eyes and looked at lo three men stood by
[58:12] him and when he saw them he ran to meet
[58:15] them from the tent door and bowed
[58:17] himself toward the ground
[58:20] 25 years ago God and made a promise to a
[58:23] woman that was barren and a man that was
[58:26] an idolatry and Abraham began to walk
[58:29] toward that promise of a new city and
[58:31] toward geneology they would have nations
[58:34] would be born from him and and after all
[58:37] that time now the son of man comes upon
[58:40] the scene and they identifies him he
[58:42] identified that that change in ministry
[58:45] and brother Branham as he and brother
[58:46] Branham would turn himself to the to the
[58:48] audience and I and call out people's
[58:50] things call out the things that were
[58:52] happening in his life but I want you to
[58:54] just remember though that brother
[58:55] Branham is not actually on earth anymore
[58:58] and so where is the son of man to be
[59:01] identified you know this is this is the
[59:05] day when people can't make it's so hard
[59:08] people can barely even recognize who
[59:10] they are and this day I'm talking about
[59:12] anything and the carnal natural world
[59:14] you know you got oh now we got if you go
[59:16] to Target they got bathrooms for for
[59:19] people that are half in the middle
[59:20] somewhere I was listening to somebody
[59:23] talk about in England it was a
[59:24] psychiatrist saying that when people
[59:26] come to him to talk about their mental
[59:28] problems the number one problem is they
[59:31] don't know whether they're a man or a
[59:33] woman because they don't know what they
[59:36] are they don't recognize even who they
[59:38] are and so that's just in the carnal but
[59:41] and the spiritual now it's time to
[59:43] recognize who you are it's time to
[59:46] recognize the day that you're living in
[59:49] and what God is doing and so many myths
[59:51] what God is doing because they they
[59:54] haven't accumulated all this word over
[59:56] these years they haven't accumulated the
[59:59] word and been studying and
[1:00:00] eating and praying and seeking after God
[1:00:02] and so they're looking for the wrong
[1:00:05] thing
[1:00:05] they're looking for they're not looking
[1:00:08] for adopted sons the ways that the Bible
[1:00:10] explains it they're not even looking for
[1:00:13] the Baptism and Holy Ghost the way that
[1:00:14] the Bible explains what the baptism is
[1:00:17] what the born-again experience is
[1:00:19] they're they're not recognizing his
[1:00:22] presence how do you recognize his
[1:00:25] presence you know one time there was a
[1:00:28] infidel up there and in Kentucky that
[1:00:31] that didn't recognize his presence and
[1:00:34] he said I've been looking for him
[1:00:35] everywhere and I look out of this apple
[1:00:38] tree I look at all the different things
[1:00:40] and I don't see God anywhere and then a
[1:00:43] prophet visited it to them and he began
[1:00:45] to speak to him just common natural
[1:00:47] words and told him well oh he finally
[1:00:50] finished the conversation with all right
[1:00:52] well where what makes that SAP and the
[1:00:56] root of the tree go down into the root
[1:00:59] in the winter and make you come back up
[1:01:01] up in the spring what makes it do that
[1:01:04] well if I put a bucket on this fence
[1:01:07] post will it will it do the same thing
[1:01:09] and just that just exposing that and
[1:01:12] presenting the word to him calls that
[1:01:14] infidel to recognize the presence of God
[1:01:17] and that's what it calls you and I to
[1:01:19] recognize the presence of God in our
[1:01:21] midst to recognize him Tabernacle and
[1:01:23] you is the word for this day
[1:01:27] you know this message will not given
[1:01:29] just to just a tickle our ears but it
[1:01:32] was given to make a way for Christ to
[1:01:34] have complete dominion in you too
[1:01:39] because like I said the mechanics make a
[1:01:41] way for the dynamics and the mechanics
[1:01:43] make a way for a full restoration I mean
[1:01:50] read some quotes here let's go to 6a and
[1:01:54] Abraham's grace come on that cloth
[1:01:59] they said he's doing the same thing to
[1:02:02] the seed of Abraham and they don't
[1:02:04] recognize that brethren see what I mean
[1:02:07] justification sanctification baptism and
[1:02:12] Holy Ghost placing of the son heir God
[1:02:15] dwelling in his church human flesh
[1:02:18] eating drinking like man the Holy Spirit
[1:02:22] God Himself dwelling in the sons of
[1:02:25] Abraham manifesting the same thing that
[1:02:27] Jesus said as it was in the days of
[1:02:30] Sodom social idea the coming of the Son
[1:02:32] of Man do you get it let's look at 6b we
[1:02:36] would see Jesus he said what's God
[1:02:39] trying to show what did he do there that
[1:02:44] was God and a body of flesh showing that
[1:02:48] God would be where and just one
[1:02:52] individual in his church in the last
[1:02:55] days in a body of flesh a body of human
[1:03:00] beings in his flesh and would manifest
[1:03:03] the same thing because if the Jews had
[1:03:06] that that was the last sign that the
[1:03:07] Jews God that was the last sign that
[1:03:09] Abraham got before the fire fire fell
[1:03:11] and here it is down to the same time
[1:03:14] today and that was that promise that God
[1:03:17] gave in Malachi chapter 4 5 6 before the
[1:03:20] coming of the dreck great and dreadful
[1:03:21] day of the Lord
[1:03:22] becoming of the fire falling he's going
[1:03:25] to turn the hearts of the children back
[1:03:26] to that original faith of the fathers
[1:03:28] he's going to turn the hearts back to
[1:03:30] the original the original Apostolic face
[1:03:33] at the father's and how is he going to
[1:03:34] do it how is he gonna do it with that
[1:03:37] capstone message that the people will
[1:03:39] eat and receive and believe and it will
[1:03:42] restore us it'll it'll it'll wake us up
[1:03:45] it'll wake us up to recognizing the
[1:03:48] presence of God so we've talked about
[1:03:53] yesterday
[1:03:54] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:03:57] forever if he was the same yesterday
[1:04:00] he's got to be the same today but the
[1:04:03] Bible says at that day you shall know
[1:04:06] that I am in my father and ye and me
[1:04:09] and I knew that day you'll have an
[1:04:11] understanding of who God is you'll have
[1:04:13] an understanding of what the Son of Man
[1:04:15] is at that day you'll know because the
[1:04:18] knowing is the evidence of the new birth
[1:04:20] knowing is the evidence of adoption
[1:04:23] knowing what's taking place knowing
[1:04:25] knowing that understanding that only God
[1:04:28] can give you is what is going to take us
[1:04:31] out of here first John 5:18 20 through
[1:04:35] 26 we know that whosoever is born of God
[1:04:38] standeth not but he that has begotten of
[1:04:40] God keepeth himself and that wicked one
[1:04:42] not touches him not we know that and the
[1:04:46] next person that verse 19 he says and we
[1:04:48] know that we are of God in the whole
[1:04:50] world lieth in wickedness we know that
[1:04:53] how do we know that by the revelation of
[1:04:55] Jesus Christ personally to you and verse
[1:04:58] 20 he says and we know that the Son of
[1:05:00] God has come and has - given us an
[1:05:02] understanding that we may know him that
[1:05:05] is true and we are in him that is true
[1:05:07] even in his son Jesus Christ this is the
[1:05:10] true God and eternal life and brother
[1:05:13] Branham said and one of his messages
[1:05:15] that I'm working for this one purpose
[1:05:17] for you to recognize the presence of
[1:05:21] Jesus Christ think about that's the
[1:05:23] purpose of the whole message for you to
[1:05:25] recognize the presence of Jesus Christ
[1:05:27] and where is Jesus Christ today he's
[1:05:30] tabernacling you he's working in your
[1:05:33] members and I believe that rapture and
[1:05:35] faith is already here rapturing faith is
[1:05:39] already here but to get it you just have
[1:05:43] to examine the word that has already
[1:05:47] been brought because this is a referee
[1:05:49] fight see I brought my own proper
[1:05:51] brother Louise her after your faith is
[1:05:54] already here you just need to examine it
[1:05:59] you need to you need to examine it for a
[1:06:03] present tense of what God is doing right
[1:06:06] now today the way to get to way to
[1:06:09] recognize God's presence is to go back
[1:06:12] into the word and
[1:06:13] examine it all it takes for us to get
[1:06:15] rapturing faith is to go back into the
[1:06:17] message to go back into the Bible and
[1:06:20] examine it and see what it says to open
[1:06:22] it up and and peruse it examine the
[1:06:25] message for rapture and faith examine
[1:06:27] the scripture for revival because the
[1:06:29] bride is having a word revival everybody
[1:06:33] else is doing their thing but we're
[1:06:35] having a revival of the word I believe
[1:06:38] that the book is already open but if you
[1:06:40] want to find the proof of where the book
[1:06:42] is already open or not you just have to
[1:06:44] examine it get into the message and
[1:06:46] examine it find out whether it is it
[1:06:48] really is the shouts already come but
[1:06:52] whether or not it's it's coming to you
[1:06:54] takes examination the bride already has
[1:06:58] a message see all of a sudden these
[1:07:01] things are taking place all of a sudden
[1:07:04] the bride already has a message
[1:07:06] she just needs to examine examine it and
[1:07:09] see whether these things be true
[1:07:11] the third pool is already here Christ
[1:07:13] Himself is already here
[1:07:15] we just need to examine it and and feed
[1:07:18] on this word and you know looking around
[1:07:22] and how all the things are situated in
[1:07:24] the world you can see that the devil has
[1:07:27] positions he's positioned rulers he's
[1:07:29] positioned rulers all around the world
[1:07:31] put presidents and things in power
[1:07:33] he's got sodomites position I get all
[1:07:35] these emails at work about all the
[1:07:37] different programs and things that Sodom
[1:07:39] Isis all that they they get they've got
[1:07:41] all the different acronyms and things
[1:07:43] but you know if the devil is positioning
[1:07:46] all of those things in his kingdom then
[1:07:49] surely God is positioning adopted sons
[1:07:51] into their place now God is moving
[1:07:54] something into place God is situating
[1:07:57] everything's just working right in
[1:07:59] accordance with his will something is
[1:08:02] taking place today if he's the same
[1:08:05] yesterday he's got to be the same today
[1:08:07] and what's taking place today is is
[1:08:09] where we haven't received a message of
[1:08:12] just clotheslined religion or for women
[1:08:15] had to know how to wash dishes and
[1:08:17] things like that but we received a
[1:08:19] capstone message that's going to take us
[1:08:21] out of here it's going to take us
[1:08:23] through the third pool
[1:08:24] the third pool back in
[1:08:26] fellowship with him to take this right
[1:08:28] back in the fellas right back into the
[1:08:30] boat I'm trying to I'm trying to close
[1:08:37] up here let me see where I am Matthew 17
[1:08:41] 11 says and Jesus centers are said unto
[1:08:42] them allies truly shall first come and
[1:08:44] restore all things just kind of looking
[1:08:47] back at some Old Testament scripture
[1:08:48] some things that were spoken they have
[1:08:50] to be fulfilled in Malachi 4 5 6 my
[1:08:53] whole our sins you Elijah the prophet
[1:08:55] the revelation 10 7 all these scriptures
[1:08:57] that we're familiar with but in the days
[1:08:59] of the voice of the seventh angel when
[1:09:00] he shall begin to sound the mystery of
[1:09:02] God should be finished as he hath
[1:09:04] declared to his servants the prophets
[1:09:05] the mystery of God will be finished when
[1:09:09] and this day today because he's the same
[1:09:13] yesterday today and forever the bride
[1:09:17] today the bride is not just keeping the
[1:09:20] word but she is the word she's not just
[1:09:23] keeping the word Huw remember when when
[1:09:25] that cloud appeared out there in Arizona
[1:09:27] and everybody back then they wondered
[1:09:30] what did that mean the coming of the
[1:09:32] Lord the coming of the son of man and
[1:09:34] yeah if you notice there's something
[1:09:37] very peculiar about that cloud because
[1:09:39] that cloud signifies ahead
[1:09:41] cloud represents the head of Christ
[1:09:44] coming back and we know that the seventh
[1:09:46] seal brings Christ back to earth God is
[1:09:50] coming back to earth so if that is his
[1:09:52] head if that is the head of God that
[1:09:56] that he showed you know as a symbol over
[1:10:00] the desert or whatever then where is the
[1:10:03] body because the Bible says that
[1:10:06] government shall be upon his shoulder
[1:10:08] the government will be upon his shoulder
[1:10:11] and that shoulder is the body the body
[1:10:13] is right here in front of me the body is
[1:10:16] typify Din you his body is here and his
[1:10:19] body is built up today I believe it's
[1:10:22] being built up it's being built up and
[1:10:27] we get I'm gonna close here in just a
[1:10:29] second hang on
[1:10:32] Genesis chapter 20 verses 1 to 2
[1:10:37] it's forever and Abraham said of Sarah
[1:10:42] his wife talking Abimelech she is my
[1:10:45] sister and I been will let king of Gerar
[1:10:48] sin and took Sarah we know how that
[1:10:51] story unfolded there's a hidden he had
[1:10:54] an underlying story there why would a be
[1:10:59] Malik want to take an old lady because
[1:11:03] she had been changed back because a body
[1:11:06] change had taken place and that's
[1:11:10] forever that's what we're walking to
[1:11:13] we've come through through all of this
[1:11:14] journey of justification sanctification
[1:11:18] our spirit being lined up the baptism of
[1:11:22] the Holy Ghost all of these virtues
[1:11:24] sealed in but now it's time for a body
[1:11:27] change and these issues can go ahead and
[1:11:31] come forward you know I believe that if
[1:11:35] ever if you ever said in your heart to
[1:11:37] find something of God that God will give
[1:11:40] you the reality of what you're searching
[1:11:42] for in John 16:13 says howbeit when he
[1:11:46] the Spirit of Truth has come he will
[1:11:48] guide you into all truth for he shall
[1:11:51] not speak of himself but whatsoever he
[1:11:53] shall hear that shall he speak and he
[1:11:55] will show you things to come
[1:11:57] just like he showed Abraham that new
[1:11:59] city just like he showed the future home
[1:12:02] to brother Branham just how he's showing
[1:12:05] us the revelation of a body change we
[1:12:09] don't have to continue here but God has
[1:12:11] given us a promise that he will change
[1:12:13] our mortal bodies to wit the redemption
[1:12:15] of the body to understand that he will
[1:12:18] change your body that you didn't come
[1:12:20] from when you realize that you've been
[1:12:23] birthed from above thank you didn't come
[1:12:26] from Charles and Ella Branham like he
[1:12:28] said but you've been birthed from above
[1:12:30] you have received a word birth and it's
[1:12:33] taking you all the way up remember you
[1:12:36] know this is like a love letter this
[1:12:39] Bible is a love letter to you and now
[1:12:41] you can look back at it and remember you
[1:12:44] can see how all this time God's been
[1:12:46] trying to show you his love
[1:12:48] how he thought of you from the beginning
[1:12:50] the the beginning of the world before
[1:12:53] the foundation of the world when he was
[1:12:54] on the cross died and for you thinking
[1:12:56] of you and remember oh I just look back
[1:12:59] to yesterday do you remember him whew
[1:13:01] and you think about maybe tonight when
[1:13:03] you go home remember that the first time
[1:13:05] that that God spoke to you and how
[1:13:08] wonderful that was and how he just took
[1:13:11] you from chaos just like when he spoke
[1:13:13] that garden of evening to exist as he
[1:13:16] took the Garden of Eden from a place of
[1:13:18] chaos and to a place of order and that's
[1:13:22] just how he's taking your life because
[1:13:26] God really loves you and has always
[1:13:28] loved you and that's why he said the
[1:13:30] baptism the Holy Ghost into the church
[1:13:32] as a sign as proof that he loves you and
[1:13:36] wants to draw you back to himself he's
[1:13:40] been looking for you for six thousand
[1:13:42] years a me forever is real and God is
[1:13:49] real and the Holy Ghost is real I
[1:13:52] believe it but y'all just stand with me
[1:13:56] and we'll just go to the Lord in prayer
[1:13:57] and I'm just getting right there if you
[1:14:04] have a need would you just lift your
[1:14:05] hand up to the Lord we just believe that
[1:14:07] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:14:09] forever
[1:14:10] I know if he was if he was able to meet
[1:14:17] although all the ones in the need of a
[1:14:20] sham gar and Jonah up down in the belly
[1:14:23] of the whale and Daniel and the Lions in
[1:14:26] all of their knees that brother
[1:14:28] branham's need down there that cave
[1:14:31] think about everybody telling him you
[1:14:33] possessed by a devil and an angel came
[1:14:35] on the scene and all the times that all
[1:14:39] these things have been done if he was if
[1:14:40] he's the God of yesterday surely he's a
[1:14:43] God of today Lord God we just thank you
[1:14:47] so much for your love to us Lord Jesus
[1:14:49] we thank you so much for your grace to

[1:15:08] not by our own might Lord of the by your
