the the Bible study so remember that and just pray come and be with us and if you don't get to come then if you want a copy you can always get a copy of them and hear what we do now on that we kind of sometimes get personal you know we we may call names on that one but uh we try not to do it in the pull pit but somebody ask a Doctrine you know or something point then sometimes they want to know who's got the doctrine well we oblige them you know but we try not to be too bad about it we we try to be nice and talk about the things of the Lord and and remember that remember each one of the sick ones Among Us and pray that the Lord would bless each one and uh we're glad to hear you know glad to have the the Reed sisters here with us and uh glad to hear them out here singing uh I can remember way back when I started out going to Jamaica now not the first time was there cuz I won't try to make them that old but the second time I think it was that we went uh we went over to brother Reed's home and there was one of those little girls was a little bitty thing and she just took to me and Wade and and we had a good time and you know Fellowship in and and with the little kids cuz I love them you know and they're all this little kids I'm just little kid too but sister Monique we were there at one time and she introduced me to her graduates from I guess 8th grade to the ninth or something like that ninth tth or something and she went around introducing me to them as her white grandfather from America well I told Danielle she's going into college I said you take a picture of me and you hang it around your neck and you tell anybody that fools with you you're going to have to deal with my white granddaddy in America you know so uh we've always had a good time with the kids and I appreciate them amen appreciate that singing Just remember these announcements I know there's other announcements uh you just keep praying for her wife she they have kind of keep putting off the time of her operation on her knee and but it should be sometime at the end of August we're not certain but you know they keep putting it off it's down to about the 29th now I think but you know that gives us more time to pray for the Lord to come on the scene and we not you know we we believe it and uh we thank God for doctors and for doing things but we still believe God's going to take care of it you know they can cut apart and put in a knee but they can't knit it back so we know who the Healer is so just remember that remember all the other announcements are right uh Hebrews 11 Heavenly Father we thank you for this day and the hour that we have and the time upon the Earth that we able to come together and we ask you to just help us and guide us Lord and keep us in your grace and love we thank you for loving us and caring for us and guiding us and directing us Lord into Thy word that we may be able to have a part to do in the end time with being the little bride of Jesus Christ on the earth for the last days and we truly believe that we're there and we ask you to just come on the scene now and make yourself manifest in our hearts and our lives because that's what you promised you would do so then we believe your promises and they are yay and amen and Lord we ask you to have your way with us remember the sick touch each one and just Lord have your way father we pray as we read your word that you would come and open that word to our hearts that we may walk in it in Jesus name amen Hebrews 11 now Faith is a substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than came by which he obtained a witness that he was righteous and God testifying of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speaketh now I hope we get this far Hebrews 12 we'll start reading at verse 21 now this is the description of Paul talking about about SII you know and the and the Lord coming down and the different things uh the voice of words and trumpets and all and so terrible was the sight that Moses said I exceedingly fear and Quake but ye are come now ye us us are come unto Mount Zion and unto the city of the Living God the heavenly Jerusalem and to an innumerable company of angels to the general assembly and Church of the firstborn which are written in heaven and to God the judge of all and the spirits of just men made perfect and to Jesus the mediator of the New Testament New Covenant right and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of Abel you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word all right we got through the part this morning of uh speaking about Abel and how that uh it was revealed unto him that it was blood and not fruit or flowers or you know things and and we wholeheartedly believe in the fact that if Cain had a accepted the way Abel did you know even after he kind of rose up kind of against him and that but had he accepted him the prophet verifies it the Bible verifies it that Cain could would have been accepted had you know had he done right but he didn't do right proving his being and who he was and what he was but he the point is he rejected God's way he wouldn't accept it now even though he had two witnesses against him all right he had Abel's word he had Abel's thoughts Abel told him I'm sure he probably as I was trying to express this morning this is over a period of time that they talk not a f minute conversation and he explained to him the things of evidently what happened in the garden problems you know evidently you know I mean surely these things were talked about and how that God offered the blood sacrifice well why not them to offer a blood sacrifice see Abel had a um a good foundation to put it on and uh you know and God was able to speak to him from that Revelation he had so he had to witness of Abel against him and he had God's witnesses that Abel was right because he accepted Abel's sacrifice and rejected Caines but then he talked to him so I guess you'd make that three Witnesses against him you know God came down to talk to Cain and said you why are you mad why are you upset you know why is it today you talk to somebody about a doctorine and the place gets red you know and they'll start hollering and screaming at you I'm not talking about the world I'm talking about the people this Mage I'm not out there too much not out too much now but just cross them on a Doctrine you can cross someone who's going to be president and get by with it but you cross somebody over their little Doctrine and I like what Armstrong said I believe him said one time if you destroy a man's Doctrine you've destroyed the person and I think about that a lot if you tell somebody they're wrong and you show them they're wrong you've destroyed their doctr you K that of that surely look like AEL would I mean Kane would have accepted it when God personally talked with him you say if God would just tell me I'd believe this Doctrine was wrong he told Cain and Cain wouldn't accept it now that's a bad situation is it but anyhow The Story Goes On that he finally killed him because of his Doctrine I remember preaching years ago about 1979 basically on the seals and I used it as like in the garden there that you know that you had the white horse rider the black horse rider you know the White Horse Rider red horse rider black horse rider because you see Cain you put it every bit in there did he turned down the Revelation and the second horse riders read he killed Abel and then he went to total darkness because he went to the mark of the beast and out of the presence of God turning down the word okay see think about these things but what we're wanting to do is more relate to now not just talk about what Cain was you know or even speak about Abel but to speak about you and I to see where we're at because to preach about Cain or preach about Abel is not the point we'll get that when we get to it of even like uh another message on over of Noah or or Enoch I believe Enoch believed Abel's Revelation he didn't believe Cain's he believed Abel's Revelation but you know that still didn't do anything for him God had to speak to Enoch himself and you know to get it right and see we think we know a lot and we want to argue points I'll say this about the message when we get to Enoch about it you got better go read your Bible the first Enoch in the Bible is a direct descendant of Cain you better go read your Bible the Enoch you want to talk about has to come over on the other lineage in the fifth chapter I think it is maybe sixth chapter right in there all right see we get those names and we think we know somebody' say well what you talking about Enoch he come from Cain no he didn't come the one about and walking off the Earth didn't come from kan's lineage because he had nothing to walk on all right but now we're talking about a positive attitude for you and I to have because the only way they amounted to anything was for their attitude to be right and their wording to be right all right but we covered as I said this morning then about Abel he had a revelation about what happened in the garden because he come out with the Revelation that he must offer blood well wouldn't that be sensible let alone speaking natural I mean look like natural I mean you walk out of the garden and God drives them out of the garden and kills the animals and put skins on them it looked like anybody would have known the way back in has got to be connected to an animal sacrifice and it was a lamb that was you know taken not a bar elephant monkey it was a lamb well Abel he began to ponder these things and God spoke to him and told him what to offer all right Revelation all right so by Faith by Revelation Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice right you remember that this morning Abel offered a sacrifice Cain offered an appeasement trying to appease God so what are we trying to do well we want to we want the the blood out of the song books we don't want to talk about the blood scare the kids you know all right so looks like it's sitting in the same shape all right now did you you did you follow the point then Able by Revelation by faith that God had spoken to the heart of Abel soul soul of Abel and Abel got the revelation of what had taken place now I I can give you these quotes if you like them as we go along sometime brother randam says that I was looking at it this morning and he says that Abel actually saw the seed of the woman which the seat of the woman is Genesis 3:15 you know I'll put imity between th seed seed of the woman he said he saw the seed of the woman all right now get my point he might not have been looking at the seed of the woman like we think but anything that was speaking when the blood was offered by God himself of the animals it would be speaking of the coming of that seed of the woman or the coming of Christ right so then when brother Brandon would speak and say he saw that you know well we need to consider that he saw that so what did he see he saw a revelation that Revelation he saw would eventually stand on Earth in the person of Jesus Christ now what would Cain's Revelation bring right a world full of people that are religious that are spending their lives working giving their money doing all the the things to try to promote Christianity but it's like I told you and I knew that see cuz I always pay paid attention I knew when I was in the Baptist Church and that was 1958 when I joined the Baptist Church I knew then that we were sending money by the Baptist Association was sending money to incite rights in foreign countries and the reason was if we can get that Country open we can send our literature in oh it's a good point not a bad thing see but to think about it Abel had a revelation brother brand says by Faith by Revelation he said Abel offered the lamb all right now then offering that lamb would be speaking of the coming Messiah right he offered to lamb speaking of the coming Messiah you'll see that each one of these Warriors or people we talk about giving their report they're all going to report about a coming Messiah all right if you miss everything I'm talking about just remember that all of them back there spent their lives speaking as an example a type we get around to Noah and Enoch and thinking about it see we want to take the opposite it's always man's way of doing it Enoch represented Rapture Noah represented the bad bad what that's the way our minds go that Noah is not the bride but without Noah Israel wouldn't come in you see we think we got it all figured out and we're facing something that we say to God this is the way I believe it take it or leave it is that the way we're doing okay to Able by Revelation by a revelation from God about the coming Messiah offered the lamb sacrifice that's why I ended up talking about will our Revelation produce a lamb we don't have to produce it God's already done it oh you're so wonderful will your Revelation speak of the atonement of Calvary could you take your Revelation how many times have I asked this question could you take your Revelation and go to Israel and see them converted no we know the two witnesses going to do that well you know what they going to take this message Abel didn't see everything but what he saw spoke of the coming Messiah do you speak of the coming Messiah that's my point this morning and if you do speak of the coming Messiah can your Revelation speak I ain't talking about babbling with words you know that right I'm talking about could I take you can I take you you take me whatever it is and go over here and talk to these people in this church across way here and could I take your life and talk about Jesus Christ now I'm not talking about your goody goodies I go over there oh brother so old s they was just the best person there was a good person which would convert the People by you being so good or would it be that you were so bad and you got converted to good which would be the Revelation that would bring the people to Jesus Christ they know the stories about being good but do they know the revelation of Jesus Christ you know Abel see we could spend all we spend a year speaking on Abel I could right now because Abel saw one true and living God you said why he didn't see them you tell me what he saw he sure had an opportunity to talk to him and once he even was killed his voice was not stopped right come on cuz that's the point we're just moving up into because what did it say now by faith revelation Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain now the prophet said it like this one day he said would your Revelation you know paraphrasing it bring God to the people would your Revelation bring God to the people you know that we are supposed to be able to take back may I quote this one we're supposed to be able to take back to God what we see him to be right and we're supposed to take what we see him to be to the people that we're talking to right that's why I don't start out talking to a new person you know about the seals of plagues of thunders of vows of serpent seed the no Eternal Hils and all of the things I start talking to him about one God and about three or four months later asked brother dick how long it took that I finally got to talking to him about what baptism because it's a pretty good way to trap somebody to get them off of their Trinity and to get them down till they say okay it's three manifestations that's a better way of saying it than Trinity okay now let's see if you believe it if that's true now that there's just one God manifested in three offices then they can't be father son Holy Ghost as a baptism right we see we want to take the great big things you know why we want to make it look like we know something right we want to be something big right okay I'm going to try for a while to revert back to an old Ministry that I once had and I've been aiming to for a while and I saw it reverting back this morning to where I'm going to stop reading so much I'm do a lot of quoting but stop reading so much now if you ever want to know where I got it at you just raise your hand CU I'll try my best to give you the quote some quotes we will select and read but I just want to preach to you to talk to you a little what about your Revelation does it compare to Abel's Revelation simple question see then you can't take two Lords Two Souls seven under virtues Prov his you know River Jordans none of that will compare with Abel's revelation so if it don't compar to Abel's Revelation it must be off of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil where Cain got hears from are you with me all right so will your Revelation speak because according to what we read here about Abel he not only offered the right sacrifice and by that listen by which he obtained witness that he was righteous you know what righteous is have you ever just looked up righteous righteousness and the things it's the actor state of being right you know what that simple enough righteousness right righteous is simply simply a state of being right now you give me another definition for that oh righteousness brother Dale is where you're so you're just so high you're so grayed up I don't you just bring it back down to human terms and say the fact of being right all right so to Abel what does it say by which he obtained witness that he was right able offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice in cane and by doing that it proved he was right you know what proved he was right God accepted the sacrifice right rejected Ables right now let me put it a little closer he accepted I mean he that came he accepted Abel's Revelation and rejected Cain's Revelation okay and by doing that he proved able to be righteous he proved able to be right that's what got Cain all stirred up is when he done all of his works and God said may I quote later on in the scripture I've done this I've done that I've worked this but depart from me because I never knew you is that the word of the Lord all right so we obtain witness you remember now what we were in the message to be a witness you have to have a substance you remember that you remember the prophet to be a witness you got to be a substance CU you can't go to court and witness something what somebody else saying you got to be personal witness you remember that all right you see we're still in the message we're on all right God testifying to his gifts there plural they wouldn't speak in in tongue shouting Glory Hallelujah right that's all we talk about gifts you know there's nine spiritual gifts and you know there's a gift of wisdom there's a gift of knowledge because is he simply saying that God testified now listen God testifying of his knowledge that he had being right his discernment he had his gifts it wasn't something he was passing out he was testifying to the fact of what he had within him as gifts and by doing that he offered to right gift right the lamb all right and he and by it he being dead yet speaketh all right you go back over in Genesis 4 and about 10 and you'll find that God is conferring with Cain and God says to Cain where's Abel well of course big righteous guy am I My Brother's Keeper why don't you go hunting and God says Cain he said your brother's blood is crying out to me from the ground now blood can't cry that's chemistry if you need these raise your hand we glad to read them off blood can't cry but it says the blood speak we get an opportunity we get far enough over until we'll talk about the blood of Jesus Christ how it speaks better thing what is the Bible talking about when he says your blood his blood is crying out to me now are we silly and stupid enough to think that AEL was down under the ground saying Lord he killed me hear my words Lord not that dumb I hope what does it mean his blood is chist crying out under me let's look at number five on our notes of brother randam and this there'll be some of these things we will give and we'll use them periodically but I want to give you this one because if I quote this one and you go and and don't pay close attention you will totally Miss what he's saying since he taken from the token 1964 to0 8 which is preached in Bakersville California paragraph 127 listen now he actually says it so if you blot this out look what brother BR well I can't blot it out I'm block that way the soul that was in cane cried out I just told you what the prophet said he said the soul of Cain cried out okay but what it are in able so now he's saying the soul of Abel right the soul of Abel cried out it was the life that was in Christ he's talk about able it was the life that was in Christ that cries out better things than any it speaks and it speaks loud it's the holy spirit all right so Abel's Soul cried out at this specific point you don't even have it mentioned until comes later NE bosom of Abraham to be that but we know that Abel's Soul was in what would be known as Paradise right am I right if you ain't awake holler yeah wake up because I'm trying to make some good points okay so now we read that God said he voice is crying from the earth do we know it's not the chemistry of the blood speaking but where was Paradise as I said we going later come on case anybody get smally about it I know what it is in scripturally that paradise in the Old Testament was basically the bosom of Abraham which don't mean the belly of Abraham it meant Abraham's Faith right but we look and think about Abel being in Paradise so he's in another dimension and we talk about how that Jesus died and went to paradise and the prophet says down right are you with me I'm trying to establish why the Bible says it he said it cried out of the earth there out of paradise spoke Abel it was his soul his soul was in Paradise I don't think it's the heart of the Earth come on but just the point that it's downward and Jesus had to go there to bring them out and then is odd when we get over to Abraham how that when God goes there and knocks on the door that Abraham says Sarah here is the man we F fed the cave to okay in Paradise all right so it was a soul that was in AEL that cried out all right now let's get it a little closer it was the revelation of Abel that God was listening to right and not to hear voices you have to hear this or that or the other not down in the ground looking up and crying out and blood speaking and what does it mean and when it says that his the blood of Jesus Christ speaketh better things let's just read a few things brother brandham says about this and let's think about it go ahead to number six which is from the token this is in uh sort Paul tells us talking about speaking of blood Paul tells us that the blood speaks you believe the blood speaks in Genesis 4 1 R 410 God told told Cain he said where's your brother he said his blood his his voice the blood of his voice of his blood's calls against out against you it was Abel's Revelation that God was hearing he didn't have to tell him Cain killed him God knew all about the whole story right listen to what he's saying so he goes on to tell us what then the blood has got a voice and the blood's got a voice now listen and and the voice of the blood is the word now are you getting it together about the Revelation that the faith of Abel the revelation of Abel is what God is hearing from because it's what saved Abel in himself was the Revelation he had and God honored that listen and that's what makes it better it's right or wrong the word is identified by the voice of the blood the voice of the blood is the Holy Ghost now we getting some more the voice of the blood is the holy ghost that brings life and it's life and it brings life to the word and quickens it amen amen sure the blood speaks it speaks a better thing the Old Testament the blood spoke of guilt in the New Testament it speaks of redemption you some are getting sleepy again Shake Yourself ha high in the Old Testament it spoke of death and sorrow in the New Testament it speaks of resurrection and life speaks of healing speaks of Joy speaks of Heaven he called out after his dead brother or it called out after his brother that had killed him the blood of Jesus Christ covers all right now just the point you don't get N Out of the message today get this Blood don't speak not listening to words coming out of the ground not doing those things it was Abel's revelation Abel's Revelation is what got him killed and God honored and accepted his sacrifice now it placed Abel in a position that we would call Paradise he made a way a place for him to stay Cain had one too but it wasn't the same place there's no mention of Cain being able to cry out so brother R said the soul of Abel cried out the soul of AEL was in Paradise calling out to God and saying God I stood for you I made the offering that you revealed to me was to be made I said now I done all I could do speaking of the coming of the Messiah so now you come on the scene by my Revelation I'm trying my best to make A's Revelation as personal as I can right CU remember only those that had this personal contact or personal was the only ones that had a positive attitude and the only ones that God was concerned with the blood of Jesus Christ speaketh better things it speaks Redemption speak salvation and all of that that Abel had was a part of that Revelation you know right Enoch will'll find had another part of it we'll find Noah had another part of it we'll find Abraham at a big chunk right but the blood of Jesus Christ speaks see that's why Paul said Hebrews 12 he's laying it down that Moses is up at the mountain and they hear the voices and the Thunders and the th and he says but we're not come to that that was Mount Shi he said we're not come to that Paul said we're come to Mount Zion the city of the Living God do an innumerable company of angels to the firstborn who's the firstborn Christ we've come to where that the blood of this one speaks greater things Abel could only speak of Salvation to come Jesus doesn't speak of Salvation to come he spoke of Salvation being present but you just think we're compassed about by an innumerable company of angels like I've always heard him say they say you say well you don't like it ca he got empty pews that there's an angel sitting in need one of them no the less people's here there more angels can be here okay but think about it when Jesus Christ died at Calvary right did that stop his voice it might a way that it could be in many many people it spread the gospel you know then after 2,000 years his soul is still speaking his life his being is still talking he speaking Redemption it says we're even coming to the city of the Living God the city of the Living God is Jerusalem but not the natural city right it's the future home what about innumerable innumerable every how you say that word without Crossing it company of angels that at one time was trying to keep people from getting to the Garden of Eden is now trying to get us into the Garden of Eden you see what I'm talking about so then what was God hearing crying out Abel's voice that was in which his soul his being that was in paradise and he was crying out for Redemption right Lord you got it started now you got to get me out of here cuz my body's up there Abel just took a cane just took care of that old garbage can put it in the ground I got to have a way to get out of here and somewhere to go when I get out and he says just hang on a while a way will be made I hear your voice I hear your Revelation you see Church you don't like it when I say a lot of things but is this the best way I know to say it Abel never had no revelation of a trinity let me say it in the backward reverse way a trinity speaks of a of an eternal hell now did you get that I'm going backwards okay Trinity speaks of an eternal hell because that's their Doctrine that's the scare tactics right the one true in God speaks that there is no eternal hell what kind of Revelation you got if you passed on is it possible that your voice could speak now let me say it this way but I just got it okay Jesus's voice was not there to speak he moved into another form called a bride and spoke through them and they became his voice but it wasn't his physical voice are you with me on the dep Pentecost it became in The Bride of Jesus Christ they became the voice of God they become the way God would speak brother Randon made it Point like this one day he said and if you hear anything things in adoption he said you going to listen to them is that a paraphrase but close oh you hear from God today where you going to hear from him goes let me go on now you're going to drop some of you going to drop your lip when brother Randon passed on now you listen to what I'm saying all right when brother R passed on his voice no longer is speaking you said but we got to taste got listen a minute they recorded what Jesus said but his physical voice was not D they became his voice right so we can quote brother random quote brother random may I give you an example it's in the Bible I adure Thee in the name of the Jesus Paul preaches that in the Bible the man said Jesus I know and Paul I know I don't know nothing about you you know what no Revelation no voice all right if you put that same insane man in front of Paul and what would have happened he wouldn't have said that the brother random has died and gone on we thank God we wouldn't have nothing to stand on right but I'm not standing on his voice oh brother D it says in the days of the voice I would advise you to go back a little bit in the message and listen what I've been saying his voic is his Revelation brother rand's natural voice said the white horse rider was the Holy Ghost am I right but then when he was corrected his voice said the white horse rider is the Antichrist so now are you just dealing with the voice of are the Revelation remember Abel's Revelation is what God heard Cain had an opportunity to hear it and a verification from God that it was right a personal contact with Cain to tell him it Abel's right and what he can't do bless God you can't tell me right no you can't you can't tell people you can quote all you want to the Bible you quote all you want to about brother brandom and may I make another statement that he says as long as this message is laying in books and tapes right it can be questioned right is that a quote but he said once It's Made Alive it can't be questioned if I die today and go on you know what a lot of you will do let's get together and play brother Dale's tapes we'll go back to the 60s and we'll start over because we missed it we need to know what he said that won't honor me one bit there won't be no shouting in heaven out of me about that but if somebody stands up and says by what the man has preached I now see Jesus myself heaven will be rejoicing and so will I why because the blood speaks and brother brandom's Revelation is what I'm talking about not his wordings the Revelation that he had of the same God that Abel saw because it's by him we know what happened to Abel right oh we've heard great theological explanations but here was a man that could explain how the blood speaks but yet he himself be glad to read it to you he said chemistry can't speak here's a man that could explain the great mind of almighty God and how that he came down to mankind but do we have that Revelation or do we have it like some brother brandham right over here on the road used to be I don't know what they're doing now brother brandham just come and swep off the foundation now we got to do the building they quote scripture Foundation Apostle Prophet Jesus Christ being a Chief Cornerstone I said before you start would you mind telling me something it was in my home I had a right to talk I said you got say you go beyond brother brand and go on out yeah brother random just swept off the foundation we got to do these things sounds beautiful because we believe this statue of perfect man is to be brought into being by the preaching of the ministry in the last days but I said all right you go beyond brother Brandon yeah I said tell me what he taught oh I'm mad arrogant hateful old dude a got a right to be I'm 74 Reagan had a right to be able to not remember but I said tell me what taught on the seventh seal and this is his wording he said you are the teacher you tell me what he said I said oh no oh no you've went beyond brother Brandon you tell me what he said I said you can't even tell me what he's already said of course he left the house CU he didn't didn't come after me to talk to him he come out there wanting to borrow about $30,000 to buy a house and he said you can just write me a check I said how many you want I said I'll write you all a checks you won't you going to have problem with the bank okay but listen folks see people can argue quotes but you can't argue Revelation there's no way to argue Revelation but you can argue quotes with people Abel had a revelation by having that Revelation from God that it was blood and that that would speak of the coming of the Messiah and that he would see the seed of the woman which would come forth right and when he passed on right God could hear him in Paradise his soul was speaking out not mad at Cain right right I I don't think those people had that idea I think that we're supposed to be able to say father forgive them they don't know what they're doing I believe Cain Abel was saying father happy he's killed me it's hard to think about that Cain could have been saved after he killed able that's hard for us to comprehend and we think he' done gone too far but his problem was was a little later if you'll read you'll find it saying that Cain went out from the presence of the Lord there's where his problem was the mark of the beast was not a Blackness put on him it was an unbelief point that culminated in him walking out of anywhere close to the garden and he goes over to the Land of Nod I think that's try to go somewhere but I'm simply asking asking a question that's why I like to talk to you I like for you to tell me what you see and I mean we Dicker Dicker pet p a little bit on wording you know but you tell me you see three gods and I tell you I see one they ain't no Dilly dating about that that's got a problem right do you understand what it means that his blood was crying out and even though Jesus Christ came and died Satan ought have left him alone his brother Harris used to say there was a good point he ought have left him alone he only had one but he said he had 120 the next whack and 3,000 the next time that's 3120 little jesuses he ought have left him alone Hallelujah now he's got all of those to face their Witnesses see then I can preach Luther's just shall live by faith I can preach Wesley's sanctification I can preach the Pentecostal baptism of the Holy Ghost and I can preach the word coming to the prophet to be able to be manifested into a bride of Jes Jesus Christ but I can also preach it in the days of Luther that the Catholic Church wasn't upset with Luther that much it was when the people begin to say what Luther said they got upset then no is it been an Ever age you see I can take what I believe and go all the way back to the garden and say I know it was the blood and even though Jesus had to die his blood just keeps on speaking brother random come to where that the word could be brought in the end time and even though he passed on his Revelation is still speaking right not just letters on the page cuz they can confuse you that's right right did you understand what I said while ago R said one day you say the voice that voice said to white horse rider was the Holy Ghost that was not a revelation but then when he saw it he said the white horse rider is the an Christ now he's got the Revelation that's right and what did he say on the first seal he said if God hadn't to come to me I was fixing to speak on things that I had written down from former messages and he said I'd have made a horrible mistake what he said he walks out that day and he says now I see why e was confused in the garden over Hebrews 13:8 and said now I see that Hebrews 13:8 is right do we have the Revelation that the prophet spoke of or do we just have the letters on the page well brother Dale my problem is that every one of these doctrines that you call the names of they every one claim that brother Brandon was a prophet well if you ever hear me come up with something the first thing I'm going to come up with that brother Brandon wasn't a prophet if I'm going to come up with some idea of my own right and then you'll know right real quick I'm saying I'm him right brother Randon what did he say he said I'll be glad when they look him in the eyes like they said to Paul he said they looked to him in the eye and said Paul didn't teach that he said I'll be glad that the day comes the people will say you never T that of course everybody's love you to don't you think they have a right to believe it Constitution wise yeah Bible wise no right come on there's only one Faith one Lord one baptism one Revelation that's got to tie all the way back and be the same Revelation that Abel walked out and believe because it listen this is my last statement because that Revelation is the only one that can speak Jesus had that Revelation because he didn't just have it he was the Revelation and he could speak better things what was Abel's off Cain's offering fruit beautiful churches yes money given yes over the world yes hospitals yes what about your revelation would you be willing to go on internet and say I believe what God has given me and anybody out there believe different come on and let's talk would you be willing there's one thing for certain if you do that you better have the goods cuz somebody's going to call you right now let's put it on the other side that we mean Doo guys get in would you go if somebody else put that on the internet and you knew knew that was wrong would you say I'll be there let's sit down and talk no that's his right to believe that see now you're chickening out all right you see for folks where we at because every day I'm right here on that little thing back there called an internet is preaching what I believe the Bible says and I want to know if I'm right but don't call me up and tell me the two Lord guys is right you know come on at least be gumption enough to come and sit down let's talk it over because you see I'll tell this story one more time we had a meeting with a great big man one time and we were to talk about marriage and divorce and we came to church here on Friday night CU we were leaving Saturday the old building little part up here all it was and they always wondered about where the scripture says that there in Deuteronomy 24 that if you know if a man put away his wife and said she may go marry another I'd always wondered on that and I knew in some way that maybe that would be the thing that would be brought up and I prayed seriously Lord I don't have no answer he dropped down into my heart and he said that's not giving her okay that's just saying she will do it thank you Lord went on up you know what quick as the big person got a right to ask the question that's what he asked one of his cohorts said it's even in the Bible that she can go be another man's wife I said were I was up speaking the man said Deuteronomy 24 oh boy I stred not like this it humbled me I all God let him go on I got the answer and everybody was just dead still cuz they didn't want to tackle that question and I simply turned around to him and I said th set the scholar th set the Theologian and he was B and I said you tell them which one's right brother I said that means that she will go do it not saying it's okay for her to do it because the next few verses says you can't go back and remarry her and if it she okay he could go back and remarry her I said the Bible answered his own s the man just sit there I said answer it brother is he right or is it what I said is right he wouldn't say a word it was one of his buddies I said brother at least move or do something and I said is that man right or am I right I said if I'm right at least you could shake your head and shook his head I said Let It Go tap that the man is agreeing with what I said cuz it would wasn't what I said it was a revelation from almighty God cuz the words right after then says that if she puts away by the second man he dies even why couldn't she go back to the first one it was okay you can't do it I said the Bible itself is self-explanatory you see folks I'm afraid of questions unless I know the answer another brother one time he said it this way he said I asked a question he said he got up behind me and he said I hate it when a man asks a question he's the only one in the building got the answer that's what he said I said brother I wouldn't asked a question if I didn't have the answer I wouldn't listen I believe God can still speak to you and tell you the right answer and it'll come and verify the word of God all the way back come on musician like sister Birds you remember her and I preached on he come from God and he went to God and I spent an hour and a half trying to explain that we was on the way home she said brother Dale I saw what you talking about I said you did she said yes she said he come from God he went to God said he was God all the time I said why didn't I Let You Preach that's what I said she had in just a minute's time the direct answer to the point did he come from God he went to God he just got all the time that was a simple-minded person with a revelation from God's word not according to education according to revelation and I thought we believe that his body was built on Revelation what do we got let's stand 107 107 think on these things could they take you the Revelation you have and go to Israel even though you had already passed on but would you say that I'm just saying what the prophet said because that's what the two Soul people said under vir people two Lord all those God they say we say what the prophet said tell me in your words what your Revelation is put it in your words talk to me about the God God you see that's what I do to you I try to talk to you about what I see what he is right it should be that go ahead brother anybody have 107 in the red book 107 in the red book at the sounding of the trumpet when the saint think about it I'm talking about a God that lives God is Hebrews 138 we are compassed about by so numerable company of why because we stayed with the word we don't have all the but we certainly know a little bit we certainly know a little about a God that's real anybody ever mounted anything believed in a real God is juile what you have a need just come let's see see if that God is real I still believe he speak you're listening to a tap you're listening to somebody God speaks to you about something right don't you think he can still speak what a wonderful God we serve and we can follow our lineage all the way through the Bible stand right there with a say I got a revelation remember the service Wednesday pray the Lord would bless and lead us remember Bible study Saturday just think about him think about what we're doing church I'm trying to speak from my own heart of what I see God to be have you got any trouble with the same God in your heart we may vary over wording but we can't veryy over Doctrine well that's the way that brother believes it well something wrong with his believing if it ain't right but if it's right our two brothers in a Minister's meeting one night they were just going at it and I was the moderator so I had the right to do it they was going at it just hot and heavy and I just stopped them I said brother just hold it I said brother now are you saying so and so and so and so yeah I said brother are you saying so and so and so on he said yes I said everybody in the building knows that both of you saying the same thing but you to because you're too hard-headed to admit it both of them agreed with me but everybody in the building knew they were saying the same thing they just wouldn't agree but you see Church Abel had a revelation and it cried out to God from his soul that was in Paradise now let me give you one more because Paradise was taken up now up in heaven according to the Book of Revelations it comes a time to where it says told under the altar crying out how long how long can't you hear that how long how long will you argue and fuss over Doctrine how long will you grip and complain about a building too hot or too cold or too many services or not enough services or how long they're still crying out and come on get it but I want to come back to earth Pi up my body what about it but you see we're so smart until we say but brother Dale you don't understand your scripture because that's only speaking of the Jews you don't understand the prophet's message cuz brother Brown was one that said they were solds under the altar crying how long how long and calls it bride but he left off the end of it where it says to avenge our blood he said that's Jews you see the prophet's message has got the answer all of our questions if we'll just pray Lord Jesus bless the people on the way home may we all Lord gather together in hearing that voice voice though we still hear today the soul of almighty God as he cries out and speaks to each and every one of us speaks to this inner being part that we are the soul of mankind and we line up with you Lord we open those doors and the things the prophet would speak of that was closed in our heart and we yield the things unto you and let you walk into each one have your way Lord bless and take care of everybody give us journey in Jesus name amen you dismiss
