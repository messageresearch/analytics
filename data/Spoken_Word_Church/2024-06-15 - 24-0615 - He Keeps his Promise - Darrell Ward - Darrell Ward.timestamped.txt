[41:39] I remember many year ago as a a young
[41:42] boy I felt him when I was about seven or
[41:45] eight year old and gave my heart to the
[41:47] Lord and I my parents got cold on God
[41:51] and took us out of church and for years
[41:54] I was out of church and he got into the
[41:56] army and spent four years and come out
[41:58] of the army and I was in an old building
[42:00] down in Jonesburg Tennessee and I felt
[42:03] the pull of the Lord I I was there was
[42:05] about 2:00 in the afternoon and I was in
[42:08] this old building by myself I wasn't in
[42:09] church wasn't at a youth service just in
[42:12] this old building by myself and the
[42:14] presence of the Lord came into the room
[42:16] and I I knew it was him because I felt
[42:18] him when I was a boy and and the voice
[42:21] just spoke to my heart and right there I
[42:23] surrendered and gave my heart to the
[42:25] Lord Jesus and is the greatest thing I
[42:28] ever done there's nothing like serving
[42:31] the lord and you know he'll be just as
[42:34] real to you as your faith can declare
[42:36] him to be some people see him every time
[42:38] they come to service because their faith
[42:40] declares that he's here and others come
[42:42] and never see him because their faith
[42:44] but he'll be just as real that's right
[42:46] as your faith can declare him to be we
[42:48] gree you in the name of the Lord kind an
[42:50] honor to be with you this afternoon and
[42:53] we know it's vacation time a lot of
[42:55] people going but we're grateful that
[42:56] you're here and We Trust something just
[42:58] be said to help you and encourage you so
[42:59] if you have your Bibles turn with us to
[43:00] the Book of
[43:01] Exodus and I know you have some
[43:03] activities and so we won't don't want to
[43:05] keep you long at all and yet we don't
[43:06] want to rush to the Lord so but I I've
[43:09] got a little thought you say well this
[43:10] is a youth service but the Lord just put
[43:12] this on my heart coming down the road
[43:14] and I just want to be obedient to that
[43:16] and I trust it'll be a blessing to you
[43:17] because we're living in a time you know
[43:20] that we're in a Warfare amen but I want
[43:22] you young people to know that even
[43:24] though we're in a Warfare God has not
[43:26] left us
[43:27] empty-handed he has given us something
[43:30] to fight with in this hour that we're
[43:32] living in and that's what we want to
[43:33] look at this afternoon if the Lord will
[43:34] help us so we want to read from Exodus
[43:36] chapter 4 starting at verse 1 and
[43:39] two
[43:43] amen very familiar scriptures to us
[43:46] Exodus 41 and 2 the Bible says this and
[43:51] Moses answered and said but behold they
[43:54] will not believe me nor aren unto my
[43:57] voice for they will say the Lord hath
[44:01] not appeared unto
[44:02] thee and the Lord said unto him what is
[44:06] in thine
[44:07] hand and he said a rod yeah right Amen
[44:14] Let Us bow our heads you said brother

[45:29] lives so we commit these things into
[45:31] your hands For Your Glory in Jesus name
[45:34] and the bride says
[45:37] amen amen God bless you you may be
[45:40] seated praise the Lord what is in thine
[45:44] hand you know no matter how mysterious
[45:48] it seems God always keeps his word now
[45:53] God don't keep his word 99 times out of
[45:55] 100 but
[45:57] 100 times out of a 100 God will keep his
[46:00] word if God says he's going to do
[46:02] something he will do it no matter how
[46:05] mysterious it seems to be he will keep
[46:07] that word even no matter how
[46:09] unreasonable it may seem to be to people
[46:12] yet God keeps his word if God makes a
[46:15] promise about anything God will keep
[46:18] that promise amen you know you and I we
[46:21] make a promise and sometimes we don't
[46:23] intend to but we'll make a promise to
[46:25] someone but we have to break that
[46:27] promise but not God if God said he'll do
[46:30] something he will do it amen he knows
[46:33] the future and he doesn't make a promise
[46:35] that he can't keep amen oh my we can say
[46:39] amen and go home today and say we've had
[46:41] a great time to have that understanding
[46:44] if God said he's going to do something
[46:45] for you he will do it and sometimes the
[46:49] way God does it seems so
[46:51] ridiculous to man and so ridiculous to
[46:55] education and it would seem so so
[46:57] strange that how he would go about to
[46:59] keep his promise but he always does it
[47:01] anyhow and the thing about it is God
[47:03] don't get in a hurry if God makes a
[47:06] promise well you know we live in an
[47:08] instant age everything's instant you
[47:10] know it wasn't too many years ago if you
[47:11] wrote someone a letter you'd wrote a
[47:13] letter and give it to a guy on a horse
[47:15] and he'd ride and give it to another guy
[47:16] on a horse and three months later
[47:18] somebody out west would get a letter and
[47:19] say hey John how are you and so then
[47:22] they would answering three months back
[47:24] and this way and that way and finally 6
[47:26] months later you get an answer back and
[47:28] say I'm okay but now we're living in an
[47:31] hour of instant messages and that if we
[47:33] hit sin and it and and it it it gets
[47:36] canceled or it don't go through we get
[47:38] upset because it's instant pudding
[47:40] instant this instant that but it's not
[47:43] with God amen amen sometimes we have God
[47:46] does Miracles we know God does Miracles
[47:48] but other times God does healing but
[47:50] it's the same God keeping his promise
[47:52] amen and no matter how ridiculous it
[47:55] seems and no matter how long it takes
[47:57] God will keep that promise amen he told
[48:01] Noah it's going to
[48:03] rain 120 years later but it rained you
[48:08] know why God said so amen he told
[48:12] Abraham Abraham you and Sarah is going
[48:14] to have a baby
[48:16] 25 years later they had the baby you
[48:20] know why cuz God said so you know we're
[48:23] living in a time people can't wait 25
[48:25] minutes but Abraham wait
[48:27] 25 years he told Isaiah said a virgin is
[48:32] going to conceive
[48:34] 800 years later Amen on a virgin
[48:39] conceived you know why cuz God said so
[48:43] he keeps his promise amen no matter how
[48:46] long it takes he'll do it anyhow amen oh
[48:49] praise the Lord that just stirs me up
[48:52] and God told Abraham that his seed would
[48:55] sojourn in a Strange Land but he said I
[48:58] will bring them out amen 400 years and
[49:02] as the promise begin to draw nigh the
[49:04] conditions in Egypt begin to grow worse
[49:07] and worse sound familiar it begin to
[49:09] grow worse and worse and and when AMR it
[49:13] was a guy by the name of amram and his
[49:15] wife named Yad and the conditions of the
[49:18] bitterness of the bondage begin he begin
[49:20] to come under the burden for deliverance
[49:24] and remember when God told Moses that
[49:25] the burn bush what did God tell Moses he
[49:28] said I have heard the Cry of my people
[49:31] so part of the Deliverance of God's
[49:33] people was when they begin to cry out
[49:36] for it amen well let me tell you I've
[49:39] been preaching now for 30 some years and
[49:42] I have never seen since Co I have never
[49:44] seen a time in all my Ministry where the
[49:47] people of God are crying out for the
[49:49] coming of the Lord Jesus and it makes me
[49:52] wonder are not we entering into the same
[49:54] condition when violence is in the land
[49:57] and all the things that are happening
[49:58] and the people begin to cry for
[50:00] deliverance and Hallelujah God said I
[50:03] have heard the Cry of my people and I am
[50:06] come down to deliver them and amram
[50:09] begin to come under that bondage and the
[50:11] prophet of God said that they would beat
[50:12] him in that day and his back would be
[50:14] bloody and bruised and and yed would be
[50:17] trying to put some medicine on it and
[50:19] he' say I've got to go pray she say h
[50:22] amram you're tired just rest tonight
[50:24] just just don't go up on the rooftop and
[50:26] pray he said but I've got to pray God
[50:28] promised Deliverance I've got to remind
[50:30] god of the promise that he gave me oh
[50:33] that's what we need today no Winds of
[50:35] Doubt could ever blow that out that's
[50:37] what we need as boys and girls today who
[50:39] have believe what God Said and stay with
[50:42] that word regardless of what anything
[50:44] regardless of the situation regardless
[50:47] of what's going on around them God made
[50:49] the promise and I'm going to stay with
[50:50] it till he delivers me amen if he don't
[50:53] answer tonight he'll answer tomorrow if
[50:55] not tomorrow it'll be next week if not
[50:58] next week it'll be next month but God
[51:00] will answer amen for he said in Jeremiah
[51:03] 33:3 call unto me sayith the Lord and I
[51:06] will answer
[51:08] thee Oh The Prophet said God wants his
[51:12] people to pray and when Israel got so
[51:14] taxed in such a condition that they
[51:16] couldn't go any further their time was
[51:18] fulfilled and their burden laid further
[51:20] than they what they thought they that
[51:22] they was able to Bear they begin to pray
[51:24] and when the people begin to pray then
[51:25] God be began to hear it was time for
[51:29] God's word to be
[51:31] fulfilled when not so tired and weary
[51:34] and amram Goes Up on the Rooftop to pray
[51:36] once
[51:38] again oh but he wouldn't give up amen
[51:41] that's right and he was tired and he
[51:43] thought I'm just going to close my eyes
[51:45] for a moment and he falls asleep and
[51:48] something awakens him and standing in
[51:50] the corner is an angel of the
[51:54] Lord hallelujah said amram I am the
[51:57] angel of God and I've been sent from
[51:59] heaven to tell you God heard your
[52:03] prayers and I've come to tell you he's
[52:05] going to send a deliverer and the most
[52:07] wonderful thing about it is that
[52:09] deliverer am is going to come right
[52:11] through your home amen this time next
[52:13] year you and your wife will have a child
[52:16] and that child shall be the deliverer
[52:19] I've heard the Cry of the children and
[52:20] I'm coming down and I want you to know
[52:22] that you're going to play a great part
[52:24] in this amam because you're faithful in
[52:27] prayer that's what we need today is
[52:29] young boys and girls who are faithful in
[52:32] prayer amen amen now we find Moses
[52:37] before the burning bush and God is
[52:40] telling him his purpose for being on the
[52:42] earth and what does Moses do just like a
[52:45] lot of us he began to make
[52:49] excuses Amen to why he can't go well I
[52:55] stutter I've got a speech impediment and
[52:59] I'm no good and they're not going to
[53:01] hear me and they won't believe me they
[53:03] they won't believe that you sent me and
[53:04] you know but God didn't want his
[53:07] excuse God don't need our excuse he just
[53:11] needs our obedience you said brother
[53:13] darl I'm not a very good this and I'm
[53:15] not very good at that God don't need
[53:17] your excuse he just needs your
[53:20] skin Hallelujah somebody that he can get
[53:23] through into somebody that he can shine
[53:25] his light through in this hour that
[53:27] we're living in Moses begin to make
[53:30] excuses but he didn't God didn't want
[53:31] his excuse he wanted his obedience and
[53:34] what could God do with us if we would oh
[53:37] my if we would just be obedient to his
[53:39] call rather than making excuses for why
[53:42] we can't do it right and finally God
[53:45] says what is in thine hand Moses what is
[53:48] in your hand and he said it's a rod yeah
[53:51] a stick it's just a stick but God said
[53:57] it's enough
[53:59] amen
[54:01] hallelujah amen and God told Moses Thou
[54:04] shalt take this rod in thy hand
[54:06] wherewith Thou shalt do signs amen and
[54:08] the Bible says in Exodus 4:20 Moses took
[54:11] his wife and his sons and set them upon
[54:13] an ass and he returned to the land of
[54:14] Egypt and Moses took the rod of God in
[54:17] his hand notice when Moses had the stick
[54:20] in his hand it was Moses stick but when
[54:22] he gave it to God it became God's
[54:27] amen hallelujah when he left the burning
[54:30] bush the the rod belonged to God just a
[54:33] simple stick just a run how
[54:36] insignificant that appears to be a stick
[54:39] against the greatest army think about
[54:43] that can you imagine here's this 80y old
[54:45] man with his beard blowing in the wind
[54:48] got his wife and children up on a donkey
[54:50] and he's going down the road with a

[55:20] the mind of
[55:22] God oh if my thoughts is contrary to
[55:25] God's thoughts God give me Grace to
[55:27] reject my thoughts and take God's
[55:30] thoughts
[55:31] amen oh Hallelujah but think about that
[55:35] for a minute that's that's that's so
[55:37] ridiculous you young people won't even

[55:58] of the world to confound the wise and
[56:01] God have chose the weak things of the
[56:02] world to confound the things which are
[56:04] Mighty the world would laugh at a stick
[56:09] oh but the power of a rod in the hand of

[1:06:30] sometimes the devil wants you to believe
[1:06:31] that you could never obtain to that
[1:06:33] because that's that's David and that's
[1:06:35] Moses and that's Daniel on you know and
[1:06:39] one of my favorite characters in history
[1:06:41] is
[1:06:43] jono and a lot of people when you
[1:06:45] mention the name jono they think of a
[1:06:47] warrior on a horse with feathers and a
[1:06:50] flute music and and no doubt when I
[1:06:53] mentioned his name some of you probably
[1:06:54] thought of that
[1:06:57] jono a great warrior on a horse probably
[1:07:00] white no
[1:07:02] doubt but how many knows gono drove a
[1:07:07] car do you know that do you know jono
[1:07:10] rode in a ferris wheel at the World's
[1:07:13] Fair yes no could be you're not
[1:07:17] sure so what are you saying I'm simply
[1:07:19] saying this we get these images in our
[1:07:21] mind
[1:07:22] sometimes and it's not really the way it
[1:07:24] is at all
[1:07:26] David was just like this young fell
[1:07:28] right here that God used him to destroy
[1:07:32] a giant amen and if God can use David he
[1:07:35] can use one of you all maybe one of your
[1:07:37] names is
[1:07:38] David he can use one of you
[1:07:41] all
[1:07:42] amen amen amen and so we think sometimes
[1:07:46] well you know I'm not brother brandom or
[1:07:48] I'm not brother Dale and I'm not brother
[1:07:50] Louise I you know I I'm just a young
[1:07:53] person but God has giving you a weapon
[1:07:56] to meet the challenge of her hour now
[1:07:57] I'll hurry I know you got a Vince but
[1:08:00] let me think about this for a minute how
[1:08:01] many remembers the story BR told about
[1:08:03] the mother's the mother's prayer anybody
[1:08:05] remember that story let me me remind it
[1:08:08] to you there's a woman was sitting she
[1:08:10] on a checker dress and she was sitting
[1:08:12] in the meeting waiting for the meeting
[1:08:13] to start and there was a woman standing
[1:08:15] there who had a baby in her arms and the
[1:08:17] baby was sick and she noticed the woman
[1:08:19] had a prayer card and so the woman
[1:08:21] sitting in the seat really wasn't sick
[1:08:23] she was just in the meeting and so she
[1:08:25] turned to this mother and she said ma'am
[1:08:27] here take my seat the baby's sick and
[1:08:29] you're standing there with the CH here
[1:08:31] take my seat and she said no no she said
[1:08:32] no no it's fine just take my seat so she
[1:08:35] get up and let this mother sit down and
[1:08:38] she started to leave and she just felt
[1:08:40] led to pray for this mother right and
[1:08:45] she turned to
[1:08:46] her and she said ma'am can can I
[1:08:50] pray for your
[1:08:52] baby but she was thinking you know the
[1:08:55] woman's got got a prayer card no doubt
[1:08:56] she'll get called and the prophet of God
[1:08:58] will pray for the baby and God will heal
[1:09:00] the baby but she couldn't she just felt
[1:09:02] led to pray and she said can I pray for
[1:09:05] your baby she said well sure so she
[1:09:07] takes the baby and prays for the baby
[1:09:09] and gives it back to the mother and she
[1:09:11] goes up in the balcony and sits down and
[1:09:14] when the meeting was going on but they
[1:09:15] begin to call prayer cards and sure
[1:09:17] enough this woman got got called and she
[1:09:19] gets up on the platform with her baby
[1:09:21] and she stands before the prophet of God
[1:09:23] to get him to pray for the baby and the
[1:09:24] prophet said the baby's already healed
[1:09:28] am he said someone say so it's it's her
[1:09:31] up there on the balcony and the check
[1:09:32] her dress she paid for the
[1:09:35] baby you say what are you saying brother
[1:09:37] Dar I'm saying this you see God didn't
[1:09:39] choose the prophet with the gift of
[1:09:41] discernment he never choose that Prophet
[1:09:43] to pray for the baby but he chose this
[1:09:45] woman he used that woman you say you
[1:09:49] know I'm I'm not a pastor I'm not a
[1:09:50] preacher but God has giv you something
[1:09:52] and it's the power of prayer amen yeah
[1:09:56] amen amen she wasn't a preacher she
[1:09:59] wasn't an evangelist she she was just a
[1:10:01] mother but the prophet said God didn't
[1:10:03] choose for me to pray for the child but
[1:10:05] he chose that mother amen he said no
[1:10:08] doubt that woman thought that because I
[1:10:09] was the Evangelist and had the power to
[1:10:11] do the healing it should be me but he
[1:10:13] said I couldn't have compassion on that
[1:10:15] baby like she
[1:10:17] could see God uses you he molds you and
[1:10:20] shapes you the way he wants to use
[1:10:23] you amen
[1:10:25] hallelujah amen and the child got
[1:10:28] absolutely well and the prophet said
[1:10:30] every man today knows he can take the
[1:10:33] name of Jesus Christ and meet any foe in
[1:10:35] any place in any time he'll be defeated
[1:10:37] he said I've met Witch Doctors I've met
[1:10:39] Demons of All Sorts had never seen the
[1:10:41] time but what they bowed to the name of
[1:10:44] Jesus Christ when Moses went down to
[1:10:46] Egypt if they could ever got that stick
[1:10:47] out of his hand that had him whipped but
[1:10:49] in that stick was where the power laid
[1:10:51] if they ever got the stick out of his
[1:10:53] hand they had him whipped remember it
[1:10:54] was the stick that smoked the rock it
[1:10:56] was the stick that he held into the air
[1:10:58] it was a stick that he held over the
[1:10:59] water it was God's judgment rod and what
[1:11:02] the stick was in Moses hand the name of
[1:11:04] Jesus Christ is to the Born Again
[1:11:08] Church amen God's not gave us a stick
[1:11:11] he's not gave us a slingshot but he's
[1:11:13] gave us the power of prayer through the
[1:11:15] name of Jesus

[1:11:55] subject to you in prayer when you ask in

[1:17:37] change the mind of God right think about

[1:17:43] bomb now in 1945 before all of us most
[1:17:46] of us was
[1:17:47] born they dropped two bombs in Japan to
[1:17:51] end World War II one in nakasaki and one
[1:17:53] in Hiroshima fat boy and big boy if my
[1:17:56] memory served me right atomic bombs and
[1:17:59] these bombs were so powerful people were
[1:18:01] annihilated instantly when they exploded
[1:18:04] it just left a shadow on the road where
[1:18:06] they were standing and for years even
[1:18:08] now years later from 1945 2024 people
[1:18:13] are still being borned with birth defs
[1:18:16] from the result of the radiation of
[1:18:18] those two bombs and yet the prophet said
[1:18:20] your prayer is more powerful than that
[1:18:22] that a mother can pray for a wayward son
[1:18:25] and she can pass off the Earth and that
[1:18:26] prayer will circle the Earth for years
[1:18:29] and find that boy in a
[1:18:30] barroom
[1:18:33] Hallelujah I remember when I was a
[1:18:35] little boy my Sunday school teacher was
[1:18:36] Sister Clark and when I you know she she
[1:18:39] got older and she was sick and me and my
[1:18:41] wife stopped one night after church to
[1:18:42] see her and we went in and sister clark
[1:18:45] was telling me she said yeah yay Lord
[1:18:47] she always said yeah Lord Jesus is just
[1:18:49] a phras she had and we went in and she
[1:18:51] said yeah Lord Jesus she said when you
[1:18:53] was a little boy and I was your Sunday
[1:18:55] school teacher she said I've seen God
[1:18:57] had his hand on you and she said I
[1:19:00] prayed for you because I knew God was
[1:19:01] going to use you and I got out of the
[1:19:04] car and I started crying I said I said
[1:19:07] think of it when I was a total idiot
[1:19:10] running up and down the road like an
[1:19:11] idiot right God had a Godly sister
[1:19:16] praying for me
[1:19:19] amen Can someone say Amen to that

[1:19:31] amen hallelujah thank you Lord amen no
[1:19:35] matter how powerful those two boms are
[1:19:37] yet your prayer is more powerful than
[1:19:39] that the power of Prayer in the hand of
[1:19:42] a Believer how much time do I God let me
[1:19:46] just look at a couple more here remember
[1:19:48] the prophet of God talked about the
[1:19:49] black woman down in Memphis and her boy
[1:19:51] had got out and got at a social disease
[1:19:53] and he was dying
[1:19:55] and she got down on her knees and she
[1:19:56] began to pray and she said Lord I was
[1:19:58] like the shoom my woman said I couldn't
[1:20:00] have a child and said you gave me a
[1:20:01] child and I tried to raised him the best
[1:20:03] I knew have but he got out with the
[1:20:04] wrong crowd be careful who you run
[1:20:06] around with young people he got out with
[1:20:08] the wrong crowd and he got this social
[1:20:10] disease and my boy's dying but she said
[1:20:12] Lord if I be like the shite woman
[1:20:14] where's your Elijah amen and the prophet
[1:20:17] of God was in an airplane flying over to
[1:20:20] Lexington Kentucky and all that was for
[1:20:23] whatever reason they had to make an
[1:20:24] emergency landing and they landed down
[1:20:27] in Memphis

[1:20:30] Peabody Hotel and the next morning he
[1:20:32] went out to mail a postcard and the Holy
[1:20:35] Spirit said turn around and start
[1:20:36] walking and he found himself in this
[1:20:38] neighborhood and he was singing I'm one

[1:33:30] weapon of prayer father I pray Lord as I
[1:33:33] know it's been an unusual young people's
[1:33:35] meeting and maybe they come expecting to
[1:33:37] hear something else but Lord in this
[1:33:40] hour that we're living in is such a
[1:33:41] raging of a war and the violence in the
[1:33:43] land lord may we come to call their
[1:33:46] attention dear God to what's already
[1:33:48] been placed in their hand well if I had
[1:33:50] this if I had that but oh God what we
[1:33:53] already possess Lord help us dear God to
[1:33:56] take this weapon of prayer and use it
[1:33:58] against their enemy when the devil tries
[1:34:00] to come and tell us that we can't be
[1:34:01] healed or we can't have a closer walk or
[1:34:03] we can't have the Holy Ghost or we can't
[1:34:05] live a Godly life father that weapon of
[1:34:08] prayer to call upon your name to come
[1:34:10] Lord and reinforce your word to our
[1:34:12] lives father God if it don't happen when
[1:34:14] we pray that night we'll believe it for
[1:34:16] the next day and the next day or the
[1:34:18] next week or the next month we'll never
[1:34:19] quit believing that you heard our prayer
[1:34:21] God and Lord no doubt there's many
[1:34:23] people people here could testify of they
[1:34:25] praying for something and how you
[1:34:26] answered it and God I pray in the name
[1:34:28] of Jesus Lord that we don't have to be
[1:34:29] 90 year old or 50 year old or 30 year
[1:34:32] old we don't have to be a mom and a
[1:34:33] daddy we don't have to be a pastor and
[1:34:35] evangelist before we can pray but just a
[1:34:38] child Lord that childlike Faith like the
[1:34:40] little boy kneeling at the altar saying
[1:34:43] his ABCs and yet God you know how to
[1:34:46] take the letters and put the words
[1:34:48] together father sometimes when I don't
[1:34:50] know what to say with my with my with my
[1:34:53] educ ation then listen to My Heart Lord
[1:34:57] let my heart speak that which you need
[1:34:59] to hear Lord father I pray that these
[1:35:01] young people today would take this Lord
[1:35:03] and that they would use it dear God Lord
[1:35:05] that it wouldn't be prayer would not be
[1:35:07] a burden or it wouldn't be just
[1:35:08] something they do in church but Lord
[1:35:11] when they get up in the morning when
[1:35:12] they go to bed at night Lord when
[1:35:14] they're when they're on recess when
[1:35:16] they're sitting at a red light and the
[1:35:17] parents are wherever they would be Lord
[1:35:19] we can simple whisper a word of prayer
[1:35:22] to you and God may we use it as the
[1:35:24] prophet of God said try it and watch
[1:35:26] demons scatter Lord we believe that the
[1:35:29] power of prayer Grant it today Lord I

[1:47:29] Fe for I
[1:47:32] am a
[1:47:34] child of
[1:47:37] God aen you love him that's why Jesus
[1:47:41] when he appeared every time he appeared
[1:47:43] he said fear not he took the fear out of
[1:47:46] the situation if they just believe same
[1:47:49] thing with me and
[1:47:50] you young people if you ever get afraid
[1:47:52] to something that's the devil that's not
[1:47:54] God just say Lord take the fear away I
[1:47:58] like what brother Ernie always said he
[1:48:00] said fear meant fear fear was what false
[1:48:02] evidence appearing real so that's what
[1:48:05] it is false evidence appearing real and
[1:48:08] that's what it is it's just it's a lie
[1:48:10] fear is a lie yes so when we pray just
[1:48:14] know that God's with you and what a
[1:48:17] powerful thing our brother um brought
[1:48:20] out some things that that we've been
[1:48:22] thinking on
[1:48:24] ourself about the
[1:48:27] power you know brother darl they use
[1:48:30] they use something a piece of
[1:48:32] something right they used a sling they
[1:48:34] used a piece of wood they used a rod all
[1:48:38] God give us was
[1:48:41] prayer but he did it what brother R say
[1:48:44] he said when when God speaks through you
[1:48:47] what'd he say he said that's the same as
[1:48:50] deity speaking right
[1:48:53] the same as what the creator that
[1:48:56] created the
[1:48:57] world you know I was thinking this
[1:48:59] morning I thought those those um guys
[1:49:02] came in the emergency room and and they
[1:49:04] did all they can do they got their books
[1:49:07] they got their medical books they got
[1:49:08] all the things they they they have and
[1:49:10] they they were going a b and c and
[1:49:12] trying to find out what was wrong with
[1:49:14] Dad going by the books and I started say
[1:49:16] look hey buddy I read a whole different
[1:49:18] book than you
[1:49:19] do I read a book it says by the Stripes
[1:49:23] of the Lord Jesus you're healed amen I
[1:49:25] said that's the book I read I don't read
[1:49:26] the book it's got all the symptoms in it
[1:49:28] there ain't no symptoms in the Bible
[1:49:30] there's cure and we appreciate our
[1:49:33] brother coming and and if you'll just
[1:49:34] take that thing and put it to your heart
[1:49:36] you know brother Brown said he said when
[1:49:37] that sword came in his hand and I
[1:49:40] believe every one of us has a sword cuz
[1:49:42] that's the word of God but he said what
[1:49:43] did it take he said it took a strong
[1:49:45] hand of
[1:49:47] Faith to take it to the enemy's heart so
[1:49:49] you can have a big old sword but unless
[1:49:52] you know how to use use it you got to
[1:49:54] know how to use it you got to have a
[1:49:55] strong arm of Faith to believe what
[1:49:57] you're doing amen we appreciate brother
