[0:08] trust everyone's doing
[0:10] well
[0:15] um all right so uh let's just go to the
[0:19] Lord in prayer dear heavenly father we
[0:22] thank you Lord for another opportunity
[0:25] that you've given us father to be
[0:26] gathered here together today Lord to
[0:28] worship you in spirit and in truth
[0:31] father God lord and to Feast upon your
[0:34] word father Lord the more we look into
[0:36] your word father we realize Lord God how
[0:39] interconnected everything is Lord God
[0:42] you are certainly Lord the same
[0:45] yesterday today and forever father and
[0:48] Lord Jesus we just pray dear Lord that
[0:49] you'd help us to understand Lord God
[0:53] Almighty this little portion for this
[0:54] morning we just commit ourselves into
[0:57] your hands now and ask these things in
[0:59] Jesus Christ's name
[1:01] amen amen I I want to talk this morning
[1:04] about I will have mercy and not
[1:08] sacrifice and
[1:10] um
[1:13] okay
[1:16] a praise the Lord yes thank
[1:21] you all right and uh I created that
[1:24] image last night by AI
[1:27] but if if you get if far away from it it
[1:32] it doesn't look right but I guess up
[1:34] close you know it looks a little better
[1:36] he looks like a merciful Jesus doesn't
[1:40] it so um and the scripture here in nahom
[1:44] 1:3 says the Lord is slow to get angry
[1:48] but his power is great and he never lets
[1:51] the guilty go unpunished I want you to
[1:54] keep that in mind he never lets the
[1:56] guilty go unpunished but yet the Lord is
[1:58] slow to get angry
[2:00] amen Psalms 103 8-11 the Lord is
[2:04] compassionate and merciful slow to get
[2:08] angry and filled with unfailing love he
[2:12] will not constantly accuse us nor remain
[2:14] angry forever he does not punish us for
[2:17] all our sins I'm reading from the New
[2:19] Living Translation so that's why it may
[2:22] not sound like Old English he does not
[2:24] deal harshly with us as we deserve for
[2:27] his unfailing love toward those who fear
[2:30] him is as great as the height of the
[2:32] heavens above the Earth Psalms 145
[2:37] 8-9 the Lord is merciful and
[2:41] compassionate we' we keep reading that
[2:44] right slow to get angry and filled with
[2:48] unfailing love the Lord is good to
[2:52] everyone he showers compassion on all
[2:56] his creation and then to Moses he said
[2:59] the Lord passed in front of Moses
[3:01] calling out in Exodus 34 Yahweh the Lord
[3:05] the god of compassion and mercy I am
[3:09] this is him saying it personally I am
[3:11] slow to anger and filled with unfailing
[3:14] love and faithfulness I lavish unfailing
[3:18] love to a thousand Generations I forgive
[3:20] iniquity rebellion and sin but I do not
[3:24] excuse the
[3:26] guilty amen so you can read that that
[3:29] hold that that scripture yourself now in
[3:32] Matthew chap 12 we we we read a a very
[3:36] pecular scripture and this is when the
[3:38] the disciples Jesus and the disciples
[3:41] were walking on the Sabbath day and the
[3:44] disciples had a need so did Jesus they
[3:48] were hungry so they were they were
[3:51] plucking the the ears of corn as they
[3:53] were walking through the corn fields and
[3:56] so we read here it says at that time
[3:59] Jesus went on the Sabbath day through
[4:01] the corn and his disciples were in
[4:05] hungered all right I highlighted it
[4:08] because that was the need at that moment
[4:11] that's what that that's what was needful
[4:14] that that was the need at the moment now
[4:16] I want to ask you was that
[4:18] sin to be hungry not at all right is a
[4:23] it's a natural human uh desire right to
[4:27] be hungry and watch and began and to
[4:30] pluck the ears of corn and to eat but
[4:34] when the Pharisees saw it but when the
[4:37] Pharisees saw it they said unto him who
[4:41] Jesus Behold thy disciples do that which
[4:45] is not lawful to do upon the Sabbath day
[4:49] so now they're they're not looking at
[4:51] the need they're just looking at the law
[4:53] right they're looking at what is written
[4:55] they don't they don't care about the
[4:57] human emotion part of it they're just
[4:58] looking at the law aspect of it the law
[5:01] says this you better do I don't care if
[5:03] you're
[5:03] hungry that's what it
[5:06] says thy disciples do that which is not
[5:09] lawful to do upon the Sabbath Day verse
[5:12] three but he said unto them Jesus said
[5:14] unto them have ye not read now he takes
[5:17] them back to the word because he is the
[5:20] word have ye not read what David did
[5:25] when he was in hunger in other words
[5:27] when he was hungry what did he do
[5:30] you you you you Pharisees who study the
[5:32] word and and and and look at it do you
[5:35] remember what David did when he was
[5:37] hungry and they that were with
[5:40] him how he entered into the house of God
[5:45] and did eat the house of God now Tab and
[5:50] did eat the
[5:52] showbread which was not lawful for him
[5:56] to
[5:57] eat neither for them which were with him
[6:00] but only for the
[6:01] priests now this is this is the uh this
[6:04] is an image of David talking to that to
[6:08] that priest when he went and he was also
[6:11] in hungry because if you if you look
[6:13] back at that story David was fleeing
[6:16] from Saul and he was and he Saul was
[6:20] after him and he had some men with him
[6:23] and he was he he he was fleeing and so
[6:26] he he got hungry didn't know where else
[6:29] to go so he went to the high priest now
[6:32] in if you read in 1 Sam you can read
[6:34] that in 1st Samuel
[6:36] 21 and so he went to the high the the
[6:39] priest there his name was ahc now ahc he
[6:42] did not have bread but the bread that
[6:45] was exchanging it was being exchanged
[6:48] out with new showbread because every
[6:50] Sabbath day the high priests were
[6:53] supposed to go in there the day before
[6:56] there was showbread that was supposed to
[6:58] bee uh uh uh
[7:00] prepared uh fresh showbread and it was
[7:02] supposed to be prepared and placed on
[7:05] the table inside the Tabernacle every
[7:09] Sabbath day now every Sabbath day now on
[7:13] every Sabbath day nobody was supposed to
[7:16] carry anything nobody was supposed to do
[7:18] any work nobody was supposed to do
[7:21] anything according to the law of Moses
[7:24] according to what God had given but the
[7:26] high priest could because they were
[7:29] working inside the
[7:32] Tabernacle and so they they could carry
[7:35] things now I'll show you here in just a
[7:37] moment 39 categories of things that the
[7:40] people of Israel or according to the law
[7:42] of Moses they could not even do and one
[7:44] of them was carrying things so this
[7:46] showbread was being exchanged out by the
[7:50] by the priest a himc when David came to
[7:53] him he was exchanging that showbread to
[7:55] new showbread and so David says hey what
[7:58] do you have there uh what do you have
[7:59] there is it possible that me and my man
[8:01] could have some of that bread now that
[8:03] bread was only supposed to be eaten by
[8:06] the high priests or by the priests
[8:08] excuse me and they were supposed to eat
[8:10] it there in the Tabernacle him and and
[8:13] and the high priest
[8:15] so the the the priest gave him an
[8:18] opportunity to eat of this showbread
[8:20] that really didn't belong to David but
[8:23] because David if I'm just kind of
[8:25] paraphrasing the story because we'll be
[8:26] here forever if we and so and so the
[8:30] priest asked ask asked David he said
[8:32] have you laid with with women in the
[8:35] last few days he gave him in a
[8:37] stipulation because they could not eat
[8:39] of that showbread if they had been
[8:41] laying with women so David said no me
[8:44] and my man have
[8:46] not and therefore that made David he he
[8:50] could he could partake of that so it
[8:52] wasn't that David went in there and just
[8:53] grabbed the showbread and and and and it
[8:55] just came right out and and no he asked
[8:58] for permission
[9:00] the priest gave him the the the the the
[9:02] reason you can eat only if this he met
[9:06] that condition and therefore he was able
[9:08] to partake of that of of that showbread
[9:11] right now Jesus was referring back to
[9:13] this story right because if you look at
[9:16] it from the surface and if you don't
[9:18] look at those little details you think
[9:20] David just went in there am man
[9:22] according to the phes and he just
[9:24] grabbed showbread and and and and didn't
[9:25] care and just moved on and me but that
[9:28] wasn't David's heart
[9:29] and see and what I'm talking about this
[9:31] morning is I'm talking about the heart
[9:34] because this is what Jesus is addressing
[9:35] here in Matthew chapter 12 I believe it
[9:38] was so in Mercy and and because David
[9:42] and his men had a need and because David
[9:45] and his men had met the requirements not
[9:47] having been with women recently a himc
[9:50] offered this bread to David which really
[9:52] belonged to the priest to eat this is
[9:54] what the the the showbread looked like
[9:56] it was two stacks of six which represent
[9:59] which which was 12 represented the the
[10:01] the the tribe 12 tribes of
[10:04] Israel now this bread was supposed to be
[10:07] eaten in the Holy Place David was able
[10:09] to enjoy this bread with the priests I
[10:12] believe in that Holy place it doesn't
[10:13] say it there but maybe they ate it there
[10:16] in the Holy place I don't know or it was
[10:18] outside I'm not sure but nevertheless he
[10:20] was able to feed his man and he was able
[10:23] to feed himself praise God now it's
[10:26] interesting because Jesus brings this up
[10:28] and and and what what do what does Jesus
[10:30] say in John 15:7 if ye abide in me and
[10:34] my words abide in you remember he is the
[10:36] bread of heaven right ye shall ask what
[10:39] you will and it shall be done unto you
[10:43] Amen in Romans 81 says there is
[10:47] therefore now no condemnation to them
[10:51] which are in Christ Jesus who walk not
[10:54] after the flesh but after the spirit and
[10:56] so you're asking what did these
[10:57] scriptures relate to what I'm talking
[10:58] about amen when you are in Christ when
[11:01] those priests those priests were free
[11:04] from that law of caring things and stuff
[11:07] like that when they were in the
[11:09] Tabernacle outside of the Tabernacle you
[11:11] were not supposed to carry anything you
[11:13] were not supposed to work you were not
[11:14] suppos in the Tabernacle or in Christ
[11:17] Jesus there is freedom amen and you and
[11:20] I are priests Amen in this hour that we
[11:22] live in right praise God so there is no
[11:26] condemnation to those who are in Christ
[11:28] Jesus praise God but we live by laws and
[11:32] regulations and everything is is is dos
[11:35] and don'ts if you are not in Christ
[11:37] Jesus but if you are in Christ Jesus
[11:39] then it doesn't become dos and don'ts
[11:41] for you it becomes freedom in Christ
[11:44] Christ paid it all he took the price he
[11:46] did it for me and I just have to rest in
[11:48] his word because he is the Sabbath right
[11:51] praise the
[11:53] Lord now I apologize I'm going quickly
[11:55] it's just time you know 25 minutes is
[11:57] just it's hard and it's hard when you're
[12:00] when you're a preacher
[12:03] too
[12:05] so Jesus continues in in that scripture
[12:09] and he says or have ye not read so he
[12:12] gives him another example he says or
[12:14] have ye not read in the law so he takes
[12:18] the Pharisees back again to the word he
[12:21] says okay you're sitting here condemning
[12:23] my disciples for taking for taking the
[12:26] ears of corn and feeding them elves when
[12:30] there is a
[12:31] need he understands what the law what
[12:33] the law says Jesus wrote the law he gave
[12:36] the law he is the law but he's also
[12:39] Mercy amen and he understands and so he
[12:43] says okay have you not looked at the law
[12:46] how that on the Sabbath days the priests
[12:49] in the temple profane the Sabbath and
[12:52] are blameless
[12:54] amen and so in you can read in Exodus
[12:57] 20: 8-11 the where he talks about God
[13:01] gives the strict command about keeping
[13:04] the Sabbath holy amen no work of any
[13:06] kind could be done at all and it
[13:09] included not doing any form of of work
[13:13] from these following categories and I
[13:15] don't know if you could see that but
[13:17] they could not there was no there was no
[13:19] carrying they could not do any burning
[13:22] extinguishing finishing writing erasing
[13:27] no cooking no washing no sewing no
[13:30] tearing no nodding no untying so you
[13:33] couldn't tie your shoe or untie your
[13:35] shoe if they had shoelaces at the time
[13:38] shaping no plowing no planting no
[13:43] reaping yet that is what the disciples
[13:46] were doing there with Jesus when they
[13:49] were plucking the ears of corn with
[13:51] Jesus amen such such activities as
[13:54] plucking of flower and plucking of fruit
[13:57] from a tree came under the is heading
[14:00] amen the same is true of of mowing a
[14:03] lawn it was also legislated that we that
[14:06] they did not handle any growing flowers
[14:09] or plants it was also forbidden to climb
[14:12] a tree or smell a growing
[14:17] flower a uh a a fruit which falls from a
[14:21] tree on the Sabbath may not be used on
[14:23] the same day the use of animals as well
[14:26] as plants is forbidden since there is
[14:29] the concern that one might forget and
[14:31] inadvertently pluck a branch to use as a
[14:34] switch you know for the donkey or for
[14:36] the horse so they could they they they
[14:39] were very strict on this but yet the
[14:41] disciples were doing this and Jesus was
[14:45] standing right there doing it with
[14:48] them and the disciples and and the
[14:50] Pharisees all they could do was condemn
[14:54] and not look at the need or the human
[14:58] aspect of it
[14:59] at the
[15:01] moment right how how many sometimes
[15:04] we're like that amen we forget that
[15:06] there's a need at the moment instead we
[15:09] look at the law more and think that
[15:11] we're going to change someone by the law
[15:12] or some rule or some regulation and you
[15:15] forget that there's human emotions human
[15:18] humanity is attached to some of the
[15:20] things that we do now we're going to
[15:22] look at a story here in just a moment
[15:24] and I I believe we have time of
[15:26] something that happened with Aaron the
[15:27] high priest and Leviticus chap 10 and
[15:30] and that Moses was caught up with that
[15:33] and he realized that he was not doing
[15:35] the right thing now you can read I can
[15:38] give you this list there they the 39
[15:42] different things but we'll be here for a
[15:43] while reading that so Jesus says but I
[15:46] say unto you that in this place is one
[15:51] greater than the temple so he continues
[15:53] to tell him that in this place there's
[15:55] one greater than than than the temple
[15:58] there's one greater than than than than
[16:00] than what the high priest did in the
[16:02] temple or did not do in the temple I am
[16:05] that
[16:06] Temple amen and that Temple is in you
[16:09] now praise God Jesus Christ you are the
[16:12] Temple of the Holy Ghost praise the Lord
[16:14] so you are Mercy you are Grace you are
[16:18] forgiveness you are compassion you are
[16:21] all these things that he was amen you
[16:24] are ones that that that that can
[16:26] Overlook things amen for the for for the
[16:29] benefit amen of of of of for the whole
[16:32] picture amen sometimes you know the
[16:35] Bible says that a multi that that love
[16:37] covers a multitude of sins am right you
[16:41] see right so we're not always out trying
[16:44] to get somebody pointing them out or or
[16:47] saying you know don't do this don't do
[16:49] that amen and publicly shame people amen
[16:52] but we're out covering amen covering
[16:54] amen and and and and and and and making
[16:56] sure amen that that that they can
[16:58] continue continue on in their walk with
[17:00] Christ
[17:02] amen there is therefore now no
[17:04] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[17:07] Jesus who walk not after the flesh but
[17:11] after the spirit so Jesus continues
[17:14] saying here so after he said but I say
[17:16] unto you I say unto you that in this
[17:19] place is one greater than the temple and
[17:22] then he continues and saying but if ye
[17:24] have known what this meth this is where
[17:26] I got the title I will have mercy and
[17:29] not
[17:30] sacrifice in other words to Lord to the
[17:34] Jesus Christ to him to God is to him is
[17:38] better to show Mercy than to even what
[17:41] is written in his in his in his
[17:42] commandment when the need is there and
[17:45] everything has met the the requirements
[17:48] amen right the requirements were met by
[17:51] the disciples were not sinning but there
[17:53] was a need the David was not sinning but
[17:57] there was a need a human need and so
[18:01] Jesus could set aside God could set
[18:03] aside amen what he had written and look
[18:06] at the humanity aspect of it and it's
[18:10] hard for us to do that because see us as
[18:12] humans we like to if it says it then it
[18:15] we no matter what happens no matter what
[18:17] the human aspect part of it is no matter
[18:19] how hard you are no matter how what
[18:21] you're going through you've got to do it
[18:24] cuz it says it and that was what the
[18:26] Pharisees believed but that's what Jesus
[18:28] was trying trying to take them away from
[18:31] and it's easy for us humans to do that
[18:33] for us because we love law but law never
[18:36] never gave anybody the Holy Ghost law
[18:39] never never never gave love to anybody
[18:42] never gave Grace and law always puts you
[18:45] in jail rules and regulations always
[18:48] condemn you but love amen brings
[18:51] somebody in love always amen trains them
[18:54] in amen if they did wrong amen set them
[18:57] aside and say okay maybe we should have
[18:59] done it this way amen or things should
[19:01] have been done this way set them aside
[19:03] praise God but law never never never
[19:07] brings anything good praise
[19:10] God and so Jesus says but if you have
[19:13] know if you had known what this mean I
[19:15] will have mercy and not sacrifice ye
[19:17] would not have condemned the Guiltless
[19:20] in the New Living Translation it says
[19:21] but you would not have condemn my
[19:23] innocent disciples talking to the
[19:25] Pharisees if you knew the meaning of
[19:27] this scripture I I want you to show
[19:29] Mercy not offer
[19:32] sacrifices right you
[19:34] know there's a way to do things
[19:36] sometimes amen where you can show love
[19:39] compassion
[19:41] amen praise God and sometimes we just
[19:45] think we're right he because you know
[19:46] it's the rules and we forget the human
[19:49] aspect of things amen we forget that
[19:52] there's people that have
[19:53] feelings we forget that people amen uh
[19:57] we forget that because we just like
[19:59] sternness and we like
[20:01] law but how about how about when they
[20:04] treat you that way you don't like it
[20:06] then oh you like to do it to other
[20:08] people but you don't like it when you're
[20:10] done when you're done that way you see
[20:13] so so Jesus here in that in verse 7 he
[20:16] was directly quoting Hosea 66 for I
[20:19] desired mercy and not sacrifice and the
[20:23] knowledge of God more more than burnt
[20:26] offerings as good as those burnt
[20:28] offerings were and as needful as they
[20:31] were because God had commanded them God
[20:34] preferred the heart of the person more
[20:36] than those burnt
[20:38] offerings God preferred more a a desire
[20:42] from the heart something genuine from
[20:44] the heart than following rules and
[20:46] regulations because God said so but if
[20:49] you're not doing it from your heart what
[20:51] is what what does that matter and if you
[20:53] have a nasty attitude about it what does
[20:55] it matter amen God said it the the rules
[20:59] and regulations say it the laws say it
[21:01] but if it's not from the heart doesn't
[21:04] matter it actually causes more confusion
[21:08] y
[21:10] amen it says for the son of man is Lord
[21:15] even of the Sabbath day so it didn't
[21:19] matter what those Pharisees who were who
[21:21] knew the law back and forth amen they
[21:24] knew and nobody could knew the law
[21:26] better than they did it didn't matter
[21:28] what they said the law the one who wrote
[21:30] the law the author of the law was
[21:31] standing right there and he was the one
[21:34] who made the final judgment then right
[21:37] and what was his final judgment there in
[21:38] front of those of those Pharisees he
[21:41] cared more about the need at the moment
[21:44] of the disciples than what the law said
[21:47] right isn't that what happened that's
[21:50] right even though he was that law he
[21:53] cared more about feelings compassion
[21:56] amen and about about the need at the
[21:59] moment than what the law said amen Jesus
[22:03] is that Temple amen how many you believe
[22:05] that Jesus is that
[22:08] Tabernacle amen where the high priests
[22:10] were work were in their working in and
[22:12] out in and out he he was a
[22:14] representation that Tabernacle
[22:16] represented him right amen Jesus is that
[22:20] Sabbath he is our rest amen he is our
[22:23] rest that we can rest from our burdens
[22:25] amen and be in Christ Jesus and rest in
[22:28] him him praise God Amen by the baptism
[22:31] of the Holy Ghost the soul now in the
[22:33] soul now we are that Temple now we are
[22:36] that Tabernacle now we are not just
[22:39] experiencing an eternal Sabbath but we
[22:41] are the Sabbath for
[22:43] others amen we're not just a Sabbath
[22:47] amen for ourselves but we are a Sabbath
[22:49] or a rest for others as well amen we we
[22:54] we receive peace and we give out
[22:56] peace amen so we should know when to uh
[23:01] we should have wisdom on how to deal
[23:03] with certain things amen and not think
[23:06] that every time you have to just be
[23:08] Stern obey the rules or else no amen
[23:12] look at the compassion aspect of it
[23:15] now let's let's let's look at let's look
[23:18] at Leviticus chapter 10 real quick we
[23:20] got 10 minutes we're looking at
[23:22] Leviticus 10 now in Leviticus 10 you can
[23:25] read there how the discip uh not the
[23:28] disciples but the um Aaron and and and
[23:33] his sons amen uh his sons his two oldest
[23:36] Sons they they they uh they offered
[23:39] Strange Fire in other words there was a
[23:41] fire that they were supposed to offer to
[23:43] to as as you know for the uh for the
[23:47] Lord but they offered Strange Fire what
[23:49] that fire was I don't know but the Bible
[23:51] says that they offered Strange Fire in
[23:53] other words it was fire that was not
[23:56] that that was not approved by God or or
[23:58] or it would didn't come from God Amen it
[24:00] was their own thing right they felt like
[24:03] maybe in their position they felt big
[24:06] they felt that they could do whatever
[24:08] they wanted to so they went ahead and
[24:10] just offered Strange Fire and God Amen
[24:14] they offered Strange Fire god with the
[24:16] fire that they were supposed to offer
[24:17] came down and killed them in front of
[24:20] Aaron and in front of his two other Sons
[24:22] youngest sons who were also priests and
[24:25] if you read the whole chapter Aaron can
[24:28] continues in the work there after he
[24:30] sees his two sons dead right in front of
[24:33] him in front of the congregation in in
[24:35] front of his family is seeing this God
[24:38] has just killed his two his two sons for
[24:41] not having their their heart in the
[24:43] right place and here is Aaron still
[24:45] continuing to do what he was supposed to
[24:48] do to finish that that that service I
[24:51] guess you could say you can read it
[24:52] yourself in Leviticus chap 10 Moses was
[24:55] there behind the scenes pushing it on
[24:58] and saying we've got to finish this we
[25:00] got to do this it's about the law it's
[25:02] about what God said it's about what God
[25:03] Said Amen so they
[25:05] finish the the the the Aaron and his
[25:09] youngest two sons they were supposed to
[25:11] take the goat that was offered for the
[25:13] sin offering of the people they were
[25:15] supposed to take it back and eat it and
[25:18] that was according to the law that God
[25:20] had given Moses but when Aaron gets when
[25:24] Moses goes back in there and says and
[25:26] asks his two sons where is the goat did
[25:28] you all eat the goat that you were
[25:30] supposed to Aaron tells uh his son no
[25:33] they they said no we went ahead and
[25:35] burnt the the goat they were not
[25:38] supposed to do that according to the law
[25:40] of Moses they were not supposed to burn
[25:42] that they were supposed to be eat that
[25:43] goat because that goat belonged to them
[25:46] as a gift from the people for for
[25:48] offering for their sacrifices right and
[25:51] so they went back in there and Moses he
[25:53] got upset angry at them I'm just
[25:56] paraphrasing this because of the time he
[25:57] got angry at them all right and then
[26:01] Moses asks them why did you not eat the
[26:04] goat why now he had to write to because
[26:07] Moses was representation of the law the
[26:10] sternness fulfill the law right and so
[26:14] in and in in Leviticus chapter 10 here's
[26:16] Moses he's he's angry where's that goat
[26:18] at right in Leviticus chapter 10 uh
[26:22] verse 16- 20 it says this Moses then
[26:25] asked them what had happened to the goat
[26:27] of the sin offering when he discovered
[26:29] it it had been burned up he became very
[26:32] angry with elzer and aamar which was
[26:34] Aaron's others remaining Sons why didn't
[26:38] you eat the sin offering in the sacred
[26:40] area he had a right to ask that that was
[26:42] part of the word he demanded it is a
[26:45] holy offering the Lord has given it to
[26:47] you to remove the guilt of the community
[26:49] and to purify the people making them
[26:50] right with the Lord this is the law
[26:53] since the animal's blood was not brought
[26:55] into the holy place you should have
[26:56] eaten the meat in the sacred a area as I
[26:59] ordered you now remember last week we
[27:01] talked about that Moses was the word to
[27:03] the people right as I ordered you but
[27:07] watch what Aaron's response then Aaron
[27:10] answered
[27:11] Moses today my sons presented both their
[27:14] sin offering and they burnt offering to
[27:17] the Lord and yet this tragedy has
[27:20] happened to me his two sons got
[27:23] killed if I had eaten the people's sin
[27:26] offering on such a tragic day as this is
[27:28] would the Lord have been
[27:30] pleased in other words if I had eaten
[27:33] this this this being that I'm I'm
[27:36] suffering I just lost my two sons Moses
[27:39] understand
[27:41] please this is why he's trying to to to
[27:43] make him understand Aaron explains that
[27:47] after the tragic deaths of his sons naav
[27:49] and Abu he felt that eating the sin
[27:51] offering while in a state of mourning
[27:54] would not have been appropriate in other
[27:56] words he was not doing it with his heart
[27:59] he would not have been eaten that that
[28:01] that goat offering with with with with
[28:03] the right mind how could you do
[28:05] something how it's hard to pray
[28:07] sometimes when you're when you're
[28:08] mourning it's hard to pray sometimes or
[28:11] or read the word or pick up the word
[28:12] amen when you're in a state of of shock
[28:14] in a state of mourning amen amen but
[28:18] that's the part that Moses was not
[28:19] looking at he was not looking at the
[28:21] human aspect of things he was just
[28:22] looking at the law right all right and
[28:25] then uh the sudden and tragic deaths of
[28:28] naav and Abu had likely left Aaron a
[28:30] State of Shock sorrow and mourning and
[28:33] when Moses heard this he was satisfied
[28:36] verse 20 amen so the musicians can come
[28:40] up so by accepting Aaron's response
[28:43] Moses shows he can empathize with others
[28:48] respect their feelings and find a good
[28:51] balance between following religious
[28:53] duties and understanding human emotions
[28:56] that's so important it's so key that we
[28:59] do that amen don't don't live your life
[29:02] amen by just what a law says or what a
[29:04] rule and regulation says understand use
[29:07] empathy and use wisdom amen use empathy
[29:10] you you use look at somebody's amen of
[29:13] the outcome of what happens if I do this
[29:16] or act in this way amen the human aspect
[29:19] of it as well empathy understanding and
[29:21] compassion is more important in the eyes
[29:23] of God than keeping rules and
[29:25] regulations when the hearts of
[29:27] individuals who made the mistake is in
[29:29] the right
[29:30] place and and Aaron's heart was in the
[29:34] right place he he wasn't doing he was
[29:37] not eating the the the the the meat or
[29:39] the thing just because he didn't want to
[29:41] he wanted to disobey no he was hurting
[29:43] he had just had a tragic event happen in
[29:45] his in his life his two sons had just
[29:47] lost their brothers and yet Moses he
[29:51] understands this amen now I'll just read
[29:54] this here and we'll finish with this
[29:55] brother brand says this now I said to my
[29:57] brother schism to and brother Ness to
[29:59] answer your question I said now I do not
[30:01] take either sides with you Brethren and
[30:03] I know as long as you fuss you are both
[30:05] wrong see because I would rather be
[30:07] wrong in my Doctrine and right in my
[30:10] heart than to be right in my Doctrine
[30:13] and wrong in my heart see I said after
[30:16] all it's your heart's condition praise
[30:19] God I'd rather be right I'd rather I'd
[30:21] rather have a right heart than to know
[30:24] everything in the word and not have the
[30:26] right spirit know every single every
[30:28] single Doctrine and every single thing
[30:30] amen and not have a right Spirit I'd
[30:32] rather have the right spirit cuz God can
[30:35] take care of the other other stuff if I
[30:38] have the right Spirit now that's was a
[30:39] quote from brother Brandon God bless
