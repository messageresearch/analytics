[35:04] pretty near 100% pretty close pretty
[35:07] close I'm not putting you in a
[35:08] subcategory if you weren't just
[35:11] curious in the 25th
[35:15] verse and they returned from searching
[35:17] of the land after 40 days and they went
[35:19] and came to Moses and to Aaron and to
[35:21] all the congregation of the children of
[35:23] Israel unto the Wilderness of pan and
[35:25] Kadesh and brought back word unto them
[35:28] and unto all the congregation and showed
[35:30] them the fruit of the land and they told
[35:33] him and said we came unto the land
[35:35] whether thou sentest us and surely it
[35:37] floweth with milk and honey and this is
[35:39] the fruit of it nevertheless the people
[35:42] be strong that dwell in that land and
[35:45] the cities are walled and very great and
[35:48] moreover we saw the children of anac
[35:50] there if if you don't of course your
[35:52] Bible studies know that those are those
[35:54] are giants the the amach ites dwell in
[35:57] the land of the South and the Hittites
[35:59] and the jebusites and the amorites dwell
[36:01] in the mountains and the Canaanites
[36:02] dwell by the Sea and by the coast of
[36:05] Jordan and Caleb Still the people before
[36:08] Moses and said let us go up at once and
[36:11] possess it for we are able to overcome
[36:13] it but the men that went up with him
[36:14] said be not able we be not able to go up
[36:17] against the people for they are stronger
[36:19] than we and they brought up an evil
[36:21] report of the land which they had
[36:23] searched unto the children of Israel
[36:24] saying the land through which we have
[36:27] gone to search it is a land that eateth
[36:30] up the inhabitants thereof and all the
[36:32] people that we saw in it are men of
[36:35] great stature and there we saw the
[36:38] Giants the sons of anac which come of
[36:40] the Giants and we were in our own sight
[36:43] as Grasshoppers and so we were in their
[36:48] sight may God bless his word let's just

[38:00] we just we just want you to feel welcome
[38:02] father we want to invite you into every
[38:04] heart Lord every mind father May every
[38:06] Spirit be subject under your word now we
[38:08] pray father in the name of Jesus Christ
[38:11] amen amen you may be seated just a
[38:14] couple minutes this afternoon I'd like
[38:16] to just take a pretty simple topic ask
[38:18] me for a title and I said well the only
[38:19] title I have is kick them
[38:22] out there's somebody else in your house
[38:24] it's time to kick them out amen I
[38:26] believe that that us as we've raised our
[38:28] hands that we were brought into this
[38:30] message if we weren't born into it maybe
[38:31] we've been into it for some years and
[38:34] we've heard enough preaching to last a
[38:36] lifetime we've heard enough of the word
[38:37] to last a lifetime but it's time to put
[38:40] it into action it's time to take what we
[38:42] believe and put it into action there's
[38:44] there's somebody else living in your
[38:46] land and where I got this context from I
[38:48] read this quote I know I I couldn't get
[38:50] it to email to you but it's in um the
[38:52] power of the devil you said well can I
[38:54] plug your your tablet in here I said
[38:56] well you don't want to read my chicken
[38:57] scratch on here so it wouldn't make any
[38:59] sense to you all anyway but brother bam
[39:01] would say the devil's nothing but a
[39:02] bluff anyhow snorting and blowing all
[39:05] Thunder and no lightning but I tell you
[39:07] brother the lightning power of the
[39:08] resurrected Jesus Christ puts a reality
[39:10] there that shocks the soul from a dead
[39:12] Slumber of these Earthly bound things
[39:15] into the immortal Realms to believe God
[39:17] and take him at his word and call those
[39:19] things which are not as though they were
[39:21] amen Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb
[39:23] called out set aside a church bought and
[39:26] washed and ironed out without spot or
[39:29] wrinkle now he's talking about us the
[39:30] church somebody say he's talking about
[39:32] me say me he's talking about
[39:34] me without spot or wrinkle that's what
[39:37] he's coming for God help us to get our
[39:40] faith in the right place tonight to move
[39:41] out on the Battlegrounds there and say
[39:44] Satan you're a liar Jesus Christ died to
[39:47] make me free and it's mine somebody say
[39:50] it's mine somebody say it's mine now
[39:53] think about your possession the victory
[39:55] that you have desire I don't believe you
[39:56] came in here this afternoon just to sit
[39:58] in a Pew or to get free pizza but I
[40:01] believe you have something on your mind
[40:03] that you're looking for God to come and
[40:05] deliver to you I say it's time to
[40:07] visualize that and say it's mine it's
[40:09] mine you can see yourself walking in
[40:11] Victory he says get out of here you went
[40:14] to your home tonight you legitimate
[40:16] people and there's a bunch of drunks in
[40:18] there kicking around and carrying around
[40:20] smoking drinking cursing and living
[40:21] immorally you'd say hey get out of here
[40:24] this is my house brother the if somebody
[40:26] was in your house when you got home
[40:28] tonight and there was somebody else
[40:29] carrying on in there you wouldn't just
[40:31] let them be in there right you wouldn't
[40:33] just let them sitting there brother Bob
[40:34] you wouldn't just let somebody just come
[40:36] into your house and some stranger have
[40:38] their muddy boots up on your couch on I
[40:41] believe you'd walk in there and say hey
[40:42] this is my house you're you're sitting
[40:44] in my chair get out but but most of the
[40:47] time we'll let the devil come right into
[40:49] our home and come right into our life
[40:51] and we'll just let him we'll let him
[40:53] have take up a a residency there and
[40:55] he'll have our best chair and he'll have
[40:57] the most comfortable seat in the house
[40:58] and we don't have the courage within us
[41:00] to say hey this is my house get out but
[41:04] I I think by the power of the word that
[41:06] we're living under it's been affirmed to
[41:08] us that we have the authority to say
[41:10] this is my house get out so remember
[41:14] this is your Victory I can't pronounce
[41:16] your victory for you but you've got to
[41:18] know what you have requested of the Lord
[41:21] maybe you've desired the Holy Ghost
[41:23] you've desired healing in your life you
[41:25] desired a a greater Victory or to walk
[41:27] in a greater light than you've ever
[41:29] known or or maybe to get healing in your
[41:31] body whatever it is you've got to
[41:33] recognize that it's already yours but
[41:35] there's a devil between you and
[41:37] there there's a hindrance between you
[41:40] and there I believe it's time to walk
[41:42] out in total Victory now imagine if you
[41:44] went into your house and say this is my
[41:46] house you'd say well I'm a human being
[41:48] this was built for human beings and I've
[41:50] got a right here you'd say this is my
[41:52] house I have an abstract deed that
[41:54] proves this is my prop property then if
[41:57] you show him the deed he will not move
[41:59] then there is a law down here that will
[42:01] make him move right so if you took that
[42:05] word to the authorities and you took
[42:07] that that that title deed you said this
[42:09] is my house I have the deed to it and
[42:11] there's a squatter in my house now the
[42:13] law would show up and they would make
[42:15] that man get out of your house right now
[42:18] you know that as a citizen you have
[42:21] those rights as an americ everybody in
[42:22] here American citizen you have those
[42:25] rights that if you went to the law and
[42:26] you say there's somebody in my house
[42:29] then by law they would have to be
[42:31] removed but I believe as Christians we
[42:33] have a greater law I believe as in time
[42:35] Believers we have a greater law that is
[42:37] exercised for us that if we could
[42:40] recognize that and say we have a law
[42:42] that protects us from you being in my
[42:44] house but we've got to exercise that law
[42:48] and if that devil that come to you
[42:50] tonight tried to send you to a premature
[42:52] grave tried to you up read God's
[42:54] abstract deed and buy his stri we were
[42:56] healed and if you don't want to believe
[42:58] that there's a holy ghost here the law
[43:01] of God that'll kick him out that'll
[43:03] prove it just ring up Jesus Jesus
[43:06] Central say j s find out if there's
[43:10] something that don't take place the
[43:11] angels of God will take their positions
[43:13] and that devil will get out you can
[43:16] stand there on your toes and say yes sir
[43:17] it's the truth amen not up here or down
[43:20] here you've read your title clear you
[43:22] know what it is oh my feel like taking
[43:25] Wings sometime and fly away don't you
[43:27] when you think of that lift up lift up
[43:29] above the Shadows give me Fellowship
[43:31] Divine yes sir stand up in there where
[43:33] all the things are possible somebody say
[43:35] all things now are some of the things
[43:39] possible all things somebody say all
[43:43] things all things are possible stand up
[43:45] there where Enoch did my when he took a
[43:47] little stroll one afternoon with God and
[43:49] walked on home with him just didn't want
[43:51] to come back Hallelujah not one morning
[43:54] or or or one evening the Rapture the the
[43:56] resurrection he had a testimony that he
[43:58] pleased God cuz he believed God now that
[44:01] sounds too simple right that Enoch's
[44:04] testimony wasn't that he knew all the
[44:06] Mysteries or he knew all the revelations
[44:08] or that he knew where to find that quote
[44:10] or that exact text but the testimony
[44:12] that Enoch had that he walked with God
[44:14] was that he believed God now I I find
[44:17] that we we see ourselves living in a
[44:19] condition that that is under our
[44:21] privileges because we simply don't take
[44:23] God at his word now I think every indiv
[44:26] ual in this building is guilty of that
[44:28] we're all we're all guilty of letting
[44:29] our Humanity come in the way but I
[44:31] believe we're getting to an age and to a
[44:33] time and we're living in a different
[44:35] dispensation where we are rising above
[44:37] just this Humanity or what these three
[44:39] dimensions can hold but but we're seeing
[44:41] a supernatural God In Action at this
[44:45] time on earth now I'm not going to
[44:46] settle for what I had last year I'm not
[44:48] going to settle for what I had 10 years
[44:50] ago or 15 years ago we've got to be
[44:52] walking in a current light with God is
[44:54] that all right somebody say right now
[44:57] right now right now God is on the move
[44:59] not tomorrow not yesterday but right now
[45:02] God is on the move and we've got to be
[45:04] walking in step with him right so we
[45:07] could come by we could ask ourselves and
[45:09] I could pass the mic we go one by one
[45:11] and say now why do you believe what we
[45:12] believe and some might say well I don't
[45:14] know some might say well I believe it
[45:16] because my my parents believed or I
[45:18] believe it because my grandpa believed
[45:20] it or or My Mama made me come here or I
[45:22] don't really want to be here whatever
[45:24] the answer is we've got to rec recognize
[45:26] the Living Truth is in our midst
[45:28] now not just not just in 1965 or back in
[45:33] another age gone by but we're walking in
[45:35] the light now somebody say
[45:39] now now not yesterday not in another age
[45:43] not back in Paul's age or John's age or
[45:45] even when Jesus was walking in sandals
[45:48] but right now we are walking in a living
[45:50] light we're not looking for something to
[45:52] come but it's already come we're not
[45:54] looking for for the prophet to come come
[45:56] back and to tell us something he didn't
[45:57] already tell us but we're walking in a
[45:59] living light already now right not
[46:02] waiting for something but it's already
[46:04] come he says that's what we need that's
[46:06] what we want is that what you want now
[46:09] you'd have to be a pretty pretty in
[46:12] pretty bad shape to not raise your hand
[46:13] to say I want the Lord to come in and
[46:15] take total control of my situation I
[46:18] don't know what your situation is it
[46:20] might be it might be depression it might
[46:22] be uh Health it might be diabetes it
[46:24] might be a foggy mind it might be
[46:26] unbelief you might be unsure about what
[46:27] I'm saying it might be confusion uh you
[46:30] might think that you're just walking in
[46:31] Victory that's that's wonderful walk on
[46:33] in Victory it might be a complex that
[46:36] somebody put on you whatever your
[46:37] situation is God is able to remove that
[46:41] but we must recognize who we are in this
[46:44] hour now the fault of of Israel there
[46:47] those 10 spies that went they they
[46:49] testified of their fault in the
[46:50] scripture and they said we saw ourselves
[46:53] as
[46:54] grasshoppers now them Giants didn't say
[46:57] you're grasshoppers them Giants didn't
[46:59] call them grasshoppers they didn't even
[47:00] get close enough to them but the
[47:01] scripture says that they saw themselves
[47:05] as Grasshoppers and so they were in the
[47:07] sight of the Giants because that's how
[47:09] they saw themselves now I'm not going to
[47:11] raise my hand in this hour and say I'm
[47:12] just a grasshopper I'm just lowly and
[47:15] meek and I I've got no power I've got no
[47:17] Authority I've got no right but I
[47:19] believe we've been positionally placed
[47:21] into the body of Christ not just to know
[47:24] it in letter but to actually perform it
[47:26] indeed to actually put a faith in action
[47:29] in this time to say it's my land it's
[47:32] time to take it back you know we sing
[47:35] the song I I went to the enemy's camp
[47:37] and I took back what he stole from
[47:39] me he's stolen Joy he's stolen Freedom
[47:43] he's put you in bondage he's put you
[47:45] he's put you in Chains he's he's told
[47:47] you you can't worship he's told you
[47:49] you've got as far as you can in this
[47:52] belief well let me just say that Devil's
[47:54] a liar you have not got as far as you
[47:57] can in what we believe there is no limit
[47:59] to how far you can get now now being
[48:01] born into this now did somebody tell you
[48:04] or or did you have to find it yourself
[48:06] that you capped yourself off yeah right
[48:08] to what your faith could reach well
[48:10] that's just a little bit out there
[48:12] that's just a little bit higher and you
[48:14] know it seemed like maybe 20 years ago
[48:16] if if you were really to preach the son
[48:17] of man nobody would know where you were
[48:19] coming from maybe 30 years ago nobody
[48:22] would understand they say this man's
[48:23] blasphemy he's preaching that de is in
[48:26] the body of Christ but now we preach
[48:27] that on a regular basis and we believe
[48:30] it with all our heart but who told them
[48:31] 30 years ago that that was not the truth
[48:34] you understand where you're walking
[48:35] you're not living where 30 years ago was
[48:37] you're living in today's light it's a
[48:39] different light of this age now you
[48:41] can't expect to be harvested in March's
[48:44] light right the light of of a March
[48:46] spring will not Harvest that plant but
[48:49] we're living in the Harvest Time this
[48:51] all right am I going too fast we just
[48:54] relax a little bit brother all
[48:56] right may you all raised your hand that
[48:59] you were you were you were born in the
[49:00] message so I assume you know where I'm
[49:02] coming from right right we cannot rely
[49:06] when they came into Pentecost they could
[49:08] not rely on Luther's message they cannot
[49:10] rely on Wesley's message they had to see
[49:13] their own message for their own light
[49:14] now we coming into another light we
[49:16] cannot rely on what they believed on 100
[49:19] years ago in 1909 we cannot we can't
[49:22] believe that that will not get us all
[49:24] the way through we've got to have that
[49:26] and more we've got to have what Luther
[49:28] preached and more right so now we know
[49:31] we're walking in a prevailing Revelation
[49:33] that we're walking in step with the word
[49:35] right remember when brother brandom saw
[49:37] you in a vision and he saw with that
[49:39] quote there I just read that there would
[49:41] be a spotless a spotless bride without
[49:44] spot or wrinkle should be walking in the
[49:45] word Walking In step with the word so
[49:49] we're continuing on in this we're not
[49:51] putting a cap and say you know you just
[49:53] got to be content to sit in that Pew and
[49:55] be handed what you're given when did
[49:58] that become a a normal thing for the
[49:59] Church of the Living God to just just
[50:01] take what you're given and and that's
[50:03] what you're given now the woman with the
[50:04] blood issue she was handed a death
[50:06] sentence there that they couldn't figure
[50:07] it out they couldn't find it they
[50:09] couldn't they couldn't heal it they
[50:11] couldn't cure it but she didn't just
[50:12] take what she was given she recognized
[50:14] who was walking on the earth at that
[50:17] time I believe there's the same Christ
[50:20] walking on the earth at this time I am
[50:22] not satisfied just taking what I'm get
[50:25] in this life but I believe we're called
[50:27] to take him at his word and to remove
[50:30] any hindrance in our life to remove any
[50:32] Giant in our land now we look over there
[50:34] and we see the victory right you see
[50:36] what I'm preaching to you you see that
[50:37] you can walk in total Victory and you
[50:39] can praise them like you desire to and
[50:41] you can walk in total Faith but there's
[50:43] a giant standing in between you and that
[50:46] you see we've got to have the eyes of
[50:48] Faith to know that that's already my
[50:49] land over there and if that's my land
[50:52] there's a law protecting me that says I
[50:54] can have it back now when those spies
[50:57] gathered there they used to live in that
[50:59] land their forefathers lived in that
[51:00] land you see they were told how
[51:02] beautiful the land was and how great the
[51:04] land was but it had been it had been
[51:06] something 400 and something years since
[51:08] they'd been there right so those
[51:10] individuals had never actually been in
[51:12] that land they were born into slavery
[51:14] but they'
[51:15] heard they had heard of a land now many
[51:19] of the these young people sitting here
[51:20] you maybe you've heard of a supernatural
[51:22] testimony taking place for this brother
[51:24] over here you've heard of God moving on
[51:26] the scene over there or maybe back in in
[51:29] you know when your you your pastor
[51:30] preached a convention you heard this the
[51:32] spirit of God move or you heard it last
[51:34] Sunday for somebody else but you've got
[51:36] to see it with your own
[51:38] eyes you've got to believe that it's for
[51:40] you and it's it's it's it's for your
[51:42] time it's not for the neighbor or it's
[51:45] not for tomorrow it's not for just
[51:47] brother Wade or it's not just for
[51:48] brother Bob but it's for you in your
[51:51] time this is the bride's time right
[51:54] we're not living in the wrong age you
[51:56] weren't supposed to have cowboy boots
[51:58] and Spurs you're living in the age that
[52:00] God thought of you to be in you're not
[52:03] you're not born out of season you're not
[52:04] born out of time you're walking in the
[52:07] perfect vision of God this is where he
[52:10] saw you so if God saw you already here
[52:12] then he gave you what it's going to take
[52:14] to overcome this age right we are living
[52:17] in the darkest age I don't know if
[52:18] there's a the the the mural with the
[52:21] ages on it but we're living in the
[52:22] darkest age right there there's there's
[52:24] just barely a sliver of light there that
[52:26] represents us thank God that there's a
[52:28] sliver of light there cuz there is a
[52:30] bride on the Earth today that is walking
[52:32] in Victory we're not defeated we're not
[52:35] walking with our head down we're not
[52:36] walking pretending that we know what
[52:37] we're talking about but we are walking
[52:39] in total Victory because we recognize
[52:42] that Messiah is on the earth living in a
[52:44] body I believe it's us I I don't I can't
[52:47] speak for you but I say hey it's me it's
[52:50] me now not not sometime in the in the
[52:53] future when when something comes to pass
[52:55] pass but brother BR said all things have
[52:57] been fulfilled already we are now
[52:59] walking in Victory if we can only
[53:02] recognize now we can't control the
[53:03] circumstance that come to us but we can
[53:05] control how we react to that
[53:07] circumstance is that circumstance going
[53:09] to tell you how high you can rise or are
[53:11] you going to just look past that giant
[53:13] and be able to see total Victory amen
[53:16] now the devil would love for you to sit
[53:18] there in your seat and be so depressed
[53:20] in yourself and to be and be coming at
[53:22] your own mind with every angle you can
[53:24] think of of why it's not you right but
[53:27] wouldn't it be easier just to believe
[53:29] it's you wouldn't it be be easier just
[53:31] to to get rid of all the doubt and just
[53:32] say I believe that I'm fulfilling this
[53:35] scripture in this age he's talking about
[53:38] me he's not talking about another group
[53:40] but he is talking about me right now in
[53:42] my situation in My Flesh in my
[53:44] circumstance he's talking about me now
[53:49] when royalty is born I they didn't have
[53:51] to tell uh Prince Charles that he was
[53:53] going to be the next king he already
[53:55] knew that he was born under the right
[53:57] bloodline that when the queen passed
[53:59] away he would be the next king right he
[54:02] already knew that it was already within
[54:04] him nobody had to tell him that but when
[54:06] you're born into another kingdom when
[54:08] you're born into this Kingdom of which
[54:09] I'm talking about it comes with
[54:12] entitlement it comes with rights it
[54:15] comes with a new bloodline and you're
[54:17] entitled to every promise that is
[54:19] Promised as Psalms 103 is already yours
[54:22] when you're baptized into this body when
[54:24] you receive him in fullness when you
[54:26] when you walk in the Holy Ghost every
[54:28] right is
[54:30] yours now how many exercise every every
[54:33] one of those rights come on how many how
[54:36] many sick people exercise by his stripes
[54:38] were healed now it's one thing to
[54:40] testify with your lips but it's another
[54:42] thing to walk in it and see it happen
[54:45] friends I I I I can't I can't explain
[54:47] this in a better way than to say that
[54:49] I've seen more of God this year than I
[54:52] have in my entire walk put together I've
[54:54] seen God move on the scene more this
[54:56] year than I have in my entire testimony
[54:59] since I've been serving the lord what is
[55:00] it we're reaching another level but
[55:03] we've got to recognize that we're moving
[55:05] up we cannot stay behind in yesterday's
[55:07] hour we cannot stay behind in
[55:09] yesterday's day we've got to recognize
[55:11] that we're walking in a higher level
[55:14] we're seeing things that we didn't see
[55:16] 10 years
[55:17] ago what has the word changed no sir
[55:21] have we been preaching different quotes
[55:22] brother Wade no but the bride is
[55:25] recognizing who she
[55:27] is we know the quote when she recognizes
[55:30] who she is she will be an invincible
[55:33] Army right but there's a catch to that
[55:35] you've got to recognize who you are
[55:38] somebody say it's me it's me he's
[55:41] talking about me this this this word of
[55:43] encouragement that comes through the
[55:44] prophet's lips is not talking about
[55:46] another group or another race or some
[55:48] people are far off he's talking about me
[55:52] now you can look at the message a couple
[55:54] different ways you could say well you
[55:56] know it's just a bunch of negativity and
[55:58] it speaks about judgment and it speaks
[56:00] about hell he's not talking to me when
[56:02] he's talking about that but when he's
[56:03] talking about walking in perfect Victory
[56:05] when he's talking about taking off of
[56:07] this old Garment of sorrow and putting
[56:09] on a Garment of Praise he's talking to
[56:11] me somebody say me he's not talking that
[56:14] it's going to come but he's saying it's
[56:16] already here my message is to declare
[56:21] that he is here right I don't believe
[56:25] that we should have to water down I hope
[56:26] you're okay with this I don't believe we
[56:27] should have to water down our youth
[56:28] services because I believe you all hear
[56:30] the truth of the hour I believe you're
[56:32] just as far along you're you're you're
[56:34] further along sometimes than a lot of
[56:36] people that have been in the message
[56:37] their entire lives because you're you're
[56:39] called and elected to receive it in this
[56:42] hour now when you recognize that you're
[56:44] coming to this Kingdom and you've taken
[56:46] on the Holy Ghost which is not just uh I
[56:48] raise my right hand and I solemnly swear
[56:50] that I'll be a member of this church and
[56:52] I'll follow this message for the rest of
[56:53] my life no when you're actually take on
[56:55] the Life of Christ within you there are
[56:57] rights that come with that with that
[57:00] citizenship is that all right if you
[57:03] moved over here from another country you
[57:05] used to be under that country's laws
[57:07] right you used to be under that
[57:09] countryes and maybe they didn't protect
[57:10] you was good maybe they didn't have uh
[57:12] Social Security and maybe they didn't
[57:14] have the benefits that we have here in
[57:16] the United States but when you became a
[57:18] citizen of the United States every right
[57:21] that every other citizen has is now
[57:23] yours right right right what's the same
[57:26] with coming into the kingdom of God
[57:28] brother Wade does not have rights that
[57:30] you don't have if you come into the
[57:31] kingdom of God you're entitled to the
[57:33] same word of Prophecy that he's entitled
[57:36] to or that I'm entitled to that that
[57:38] that brother Lis is entitled to we're
[57:39] all walking in the same Kingdom right
[57:41] there's no big eyes or or big mes and
[57:44] little 's we're all walking under the
[57:46] same Authority when you recognize where
[57:49] you're living now the hour in in this
[57:52] age everybody's fighting for their
[57:53] rights everybody's fighting fighting for
[57:55] for uh uh black lives matter or or lgbtq
[57:59] rst rights or whatever it is everybody's
[58:02] fighting for their rights and yet the
[58:04] people of God sit there and they take
[58:06] what the devil gives them and they think
[58:08] that's how they have to live not anymore
[58:11] I say from today on you've got to
[58:13] recognize in your heart I'm kicking him
[58:15] out maybe there's a devil been living in
[58:17] your life and been bringing you down and
[58:19] bringing you sorrow and telling you that
[58:20] you're not ever going to make it and
[58:22] telling you that the Rapture is going to
[58:23] pass you by I say it's time to kick him
[58:25] out take the word and use it for what it
[58:28] was meant for for authority to kick him
[58:30] out of your life kick him out of your
[58:32] house kick him out of your kingdom let
[58:34] the word do the cutting let the word cut
[58:37] off of that that that devil that's been
[58:38] hanging on to your life and telling you
[58:40] that you're not going to make it and you
[58:41] don't have the authority you don't have
[58:43] the faith that's the devil of
[58:44] condemnation and I say it's time to kick
[58:46] him out you've been given given the same
[58:49] promises that every man before you has
[58:51] been given that's come into this Kingdom
[58:53] amen the same Authority that Peter was
[58:56] given when he would walk by someone and
[58:57] his shadow would do the healing that
[59:00] same Authority lives within the bride in
[59:02] this hour the same Authority that would
[59:04] take Paul and Silas out of a prison cell
[59:07] that would shake the walls loose and
[59:08] they would walk in Freedom that same
[59:10] Authority is in the bride in this
[59:13] hour we're walking in it now now we've
[59:16] got to change the way we're looking at
[59:17] it we've been given this well this is
[59:19] just the way I am that's just how I was
[59:22] meant to be I just I just have a woe is
[59:25] me kind of attitude I just have a a
[59:28] Debbie Downer yeah but that's not
[59:31] walking in Victory you're saying I'm
[59:33] just a grasshopper in the sight of that
[59:35] giant I don't know how you look at
[59:37] yourself but you've got to see yourself
[59:39] how God sees you he sees his child when
[59:41] I when I look at my son or my daughter I
[59:44] don't see a a lesser human being or
[59:46] somebody smaller I see I give my life
[59:48] for that person you've got to recognize
[59:50] that God sees you as his beloved he's
[59:53] not looking at you in some lesser manner
[59:55] thinking that he's not going to move on
[59:56] the scene for you like he did somebody
[59:58] else you're not a grasshopper in God's
[1:00:00] sight but what about your own faith what
[1:00:02] is it testify about yourself well we're
[1:00:05] just a grasshopper to this this is a
[1:00:07] dark hour we're living in this is a Dark
[1:00:09] Age and you know I thought we were just
[1:00:11] going to come in here and and he was
[1:00:13] just going to preach us a simple sermon
[1:00:14] but this is what the lord gave me out my
[1:00:16] heart you know I thought he was just
[1:00:17] going to make me feel
[1:00:19] good but I'm telling you who you are in
[1:00:22] this hour and by telling you who you are
[1:00:24] you're identifying what rights are
[1:00:27] yours the devil that comes to you and
[1:00:29] torments you at night you have a right
[1:00:31] to kick that devil out of your mind you
[1:00:33] have a right to kick that devil out of
[1:00:34] your home it's your right the law of God
[1:00:38] protects you from those things but
[1:00:40] you've got to recognize it's not a
[1:00:42] yesterday thing it's not just that if I
[1:00:45] do this and I carry my cross across the
[1:00:47] the middle of the desert on my knees
[1:00:48] I'll be entitled to this but right now
[1:00:51] while I'm speaking these words you can
[1:00:53] come into this Kingdom and you can be
[1:00:55] entitled to every right that a Christian
[1:00:58] has it's yours already it's a living
[1:01:01] fire right it's not it's not a dead cold
[1:01:03] fire in another age gone by it's alive
[1:01:06] today right we sing the song He's Alive
[1:01:09] and Well living in
[1:01:13] me he does it say he expired yesterday
[1:01:17] or that the faith of God only works for
[1:01:19] a certain amount of time and you know
[1:01:21] those things just don't happen
[1:01:23] anymore days of Miracles has passed
[1:01:26] right it's the same little spirit that
[1:01:27] the prophet preached against you know
[1:01:28] those things don't happen anymore they
[1:01:30] don't happen around here wouldn't you
[1:01:32] like to be the change in that wouldn't
[1:01:34] you like to see the manifestation of the
[1:01:36] promises of God coming to pass in your
[1:01:39] church in your life in your circumstance
[1:01:41] and what your giant is in front of you
[1:01:43] wouldn't you like to see that same old
[1:01:45] David anointing strike you that same old
[1:01:48] Joshua anointing strike you and say
[1:01:50] there's more for us than there is
[1:01:51] against us there's more on my side than
[1:01:54] there is is against me we are given
[1:01:56] Kingdom Authority in this hour but we've
[1:01:57] got to recognize we are the bride in
[1:02:01] this hour we're not looking for
[1:02:03] something to come we're already there
[1:02:06] sisters if you knew the power that you
[1:02:08] hold within your faith if you could
[1:02:10] recognize that God gave you all that he
[1:02:12] was is laying in the church now he never
[1:02:15] intended for that power to lay dormant
[1:02:17] he intended it to defeat the Devil any
[1:02:20] circumstance any time any place under
[1:02:22] any condition this word will defeat the
[1:02:25] Devil but so many times we end up in the
[1:02:28] corner and we think somehow we're
[1:02:29] defeated or we're not able or we're just
[1:02:31] stuck with this
[1:02:33] circumstance I say kick him out I say
[1:02:36] take the word which you already have the
[1:02:38] knowledge of and kick him
[1:02:41] out oh he says oh my that takes the
[1:02:44] wishbone out and puts a backbone in
[1:02:46] there when you come to find out Jesus
[1:02:49] really we got to we we he raised from
[1:02:51] the dead and is here tonight proving his
[1:02:53] s alive life your faith in action your
[1:02:57] faith put in action so what drives the
[1:03:00] devil out your faith somebody say my
[1:03:04] faith my to think that you have the
[1:03:07] faith to drive out the devil now if you
[1:03:09] walk up to the devil and you come at him
[1:03:11] with a with a little bit of uh fear in
[1:03:17] you he's been defeating humans for ages
[1:03:21] for thousands of years you come to the
[1:03:23] Devil with a little bit of doubt in your
[1:03:25] voice and you say it's my faith I
[1:03:28] think that Devil's not going to move and
[1:03:31] maybe you've come up against this giant
[1:03:32] of which I'm talking about tonight and
[1:03:34] you tried it before and you said Yeah by
[1:03:36] maybe you worked up under emotions
[1:03:38] sometime and you said by faith be
[1:03:39] removed but there was an element of
[1:03:41] doubt in there that it just wasn't for
[1:03:43] you that devil will recognize that doubt
[1:03:46] he recognizes where that comes from but
[1:03:48] if you can ever get past that point that
[1:03:50] point of Doubt to recognize that this
[1:03:52] word is for me this is my weapon this is
[1:03:55] my sword this is how I defeat him it's
[1:03:58] not it's not a mythical thing out there
[1:04:00] that maybe will come to a people one day
[1:04:02] but it's mine it's right now then you
[1:04:04] can say it's my faith somebody say my
[1:04:07] faith my
[1:04:09] faith what's good is it going to do to
[1:04:11] read of a historical God if he isn't the
[1:04:14] same God today what's good is it going
[1:04:16] to do to read about old George
[1:04:17] Washington if he's dead and gone it's
[1:04:19] just a history fact but Jesus raised
[1:04:22] from the dead and he's the same today he
[1:04:24] what good does it do to paint a fire to
[1:04:26] a freezing man show him a picture of a
[1:04:28] nice big warm fire and the man's a
[1:04:31] freezing that's something that was
[1:04:33] that's what people are trying to keep
[1:04:34] you alive by today no wonder we got a
[1:04:37] failure in America of religion no wonder
[1:04:39] the magazine says the spiritual ongo is
[1:04:41] a burst is because they failed to
[1:04:43] represent the right thing to them
[1:04:45] they're trying to teach them of a
[1:04:47] historical God but what we need today is
[1:04:50] a god resurrected from the dead and on
[1:04:53] hand right now somebody say right now to
[1:04:56] do whatever he promised he would do to
[1:04:59] confirm his word and we need delegates
[1:05:02] out there in the audience who's willing
[1:05:03] to rest their soul on any word that God
[1:05:06] said and put it into action how many
[1:05:10] wants to fulfill that quote right there
[1:05:11] we need delegates out here in the
[1:05:13] audience that will take God at his word
[1:05:15] and will put it into action somebody say
[1:05:17] me somebody say I'll do it we got to
[1:05:20] have the same anointing that Isaiah said
[1:05:22] here am I Lord I may not be able in my
[1:05:25] flesh I may not think I'm I'm worthy in
[1:05:27] my flesh but here am I send
[1:05:30] me that's what we need today that's what
[1:05:34] we need as men and women who stand up to
[1:05:36] the Forefront there and call the devil a
[1:05:38] liar and say Jesus Christ stripped you
[1:05:39] and robbed you of every right you had
[1:05:42] and I'm in Christ Jesus and the world
[1:05:45] belongs to me amen right amen what good
[1:05:48] does it do to have a bird to have wings
[1:05:50] as long as you've got him in a cage he
[1:05:52] can't fly he don't need no wings if
[1:05:54] you've got them in a cage that's the way
[1:05:56] a lot of these people are they're in a
[1:05:57] cage Tod of the days the Miracles has
[1:05:59] passed oh there's a God oh yes we
[1:06:02] believe that Jesus was his son I've
[1:06:04] accepted him as personal savior but I
[1:06:06] tell you all those things is back there
[1:06:07] in the old days they're pasted how many
[1:06:11] had to encounter that devil of unbelief
[1:06:13] all those things are passed there in't
[1:06:15] another day gone by the days of Miracles
[1:06:17] is passed what goods your wings going to
[1:06:19] do you what goods your faith to do you
[1:06:22] if you can't turn it loose what good is
[1:06:25] your faith going to do if you can't put
[1:06:26] it in action certainly if I believe
[1:06:29] Jesus lives today I'll put it into
[1:06:31] action what good is it to say that we
[1:06:34] have a Vindicated Word of Promise in
[1:06:36] this hour that it's infallible we can
[1:06:38] argue it till we're blue in the face and
[1:06:39] say there's no contradiction there's no
[1:06:41] mistake and yet we've not even put it
[1:06:43] into action
[1:06:44] yet man we've got so concerned about
[1:06:47] proving this to ourselves we've missed
[1:06:48] that we can use it against the devil and
[1:06:51] we just take him at his word just say I
[1:06:54] believe this wholeheartedly it works let
[1:06:56] me say this message works it works when
[1:06:59] when you need him it works when you
[1:07:00] think that there's no way out it works
[1:07:02] when when you're in desperation and
[1:07:03] you're crying out for help this message
[1:07:06] Works we've already proven that to be so
[1:07:08] but let it work for
[1:07:10] you what good is it for God to give you
[1:07:12] wings if you're going to be in a cage
[1:07:14] your whole life what good is it for God
[1:07:16] to give you the ability to worship if
[1:07:17] you're never going to use it what good
[1:07:19] is it for God to give you breath in your
[1:07:21] lungs if you're never going to use it to
[1:07:22] glorify him amen brother that was
[1:07:25] playing the piano wonderful playing what
[1:07:26] good would it be for God to give you the
[1:07:28] gift to play the piano if you're not
[1:07:30] going to use it to glorify him what good
[1:07:32] would it be for God to give you
[1:07:33] discernment of the word to look over
[1:07:35] this and to know the quotes and to know
[1:07:37] that if you're not going to use it to
[1:07:38] glorify him it was not put here so we
[1:07:40] could argue back and forth about it it
[1:07:42] was put here so we could put it into
[1:07:45] action in our lives now maybe we'll talk
[1:07:48] to the back for a second how many M and
[1:07:50] daddies are ready to get the devil out
[1:07:52] of your house I've had enough of the
[1:07:54] devil in my house and dictating to me
[1:07:56] how my kids can go and what direction
[1:07:58] they're going to take I say it's time to
[1:08:00] kick him out I say it's time to take the
[1:08:03] word that you've already been given and
[1:08:05] use it for the purpose it was given for
[1:08:07] and kick the devil
[1:08:09] out what good is it to give be given the
[1:08:11] gift of the Holy Ghost if you're just
[1:08:13] going to sit there if you're just going
[1:08:15] to wait on him to do something for you
[1:08:16] if you're going to wait on some emotion
[1:08:18] to come by or the light to flicker or
[1:08:20] the chain to move what good is that God
[1:08:23] is waiting for somebody to put their
[1:08:24] faith into action this is our time this
[1:08:28] is our hour let me say are you the bride
[1:08:31] are you the bride over here you believe
[1:08:34] you're the bride is this your age is
[1:08:37] this where you live is this your your
[1:08:39] dimension here is this your time it's
[1:08:41] your time to let your word shine don't
[1:08:45] put it off to somebody else to do or
[1:08:46] just a pastor or just the ministry but
[1:08:49] the son of man Ministry is in his bride
[1:08:52] it's in women it's in Brothers it's in
[1:08:54] the it's in the in the PA girl it's in
[1:08:56] the the sound man back there it's in the
[1:08:58] drum player the ministry of this hour is
[1:09:01] in the
[1:09:03] bride why would it just be there if we
[1:09:07] were had to deal with whatever we were
[1:09:09] given come on maybe you were given H
[1:09:11] just a just a small
[1:09:14] portion but that's not what your that's
[1:09:16] not your
[1:09:17] cap who told you you couldn't
[1:09:20] fly well gravity told me that right well
[1:09:23] who who told you you couldn't walk in
[1:09:25] perfect victory in this
[1:09:26] word Some Devil told you that some devil
[1:09:30] came along and he told you that this was
[1:09:32] just the way it is that you're just
[1:09:35] going to continue to live under your
[1:09:36] means and just go from meeting to
[1:09:38] meeting and from paycheck to paycheck
[1:09:40] and you're never going to get ahead
[1:09:42] that's some devil that came into the
[1:09:43] church and told our young people that
[1:09:45] that they would have to live under this
[1:09:47] kind of expectation but I say it's time
[1:09:49] to kick that kind of expectation out of
[1:09:51] the church this word did not come in our
[1:09:53] our hour so we could live under our our
[1:09:55] means or under our expectations but it
[1:09:58] came that we could have fullness that we
[1:09:59] could have life that we could get under
[1:10:01] the fountain and drink freely but my
[1:10:04] sometimes it seems that we've got a
[1:10:06] battle to get under that Fountain we've
[1:10:07] got a battle to actually get underneath
[1:10:09] it that's right my we have to battle our
[1:10:12] own thoughts we got to battle traditions
[1:10:14] we got to battle uh false teaching we
[1:10:16] got to battle everything that the devil
[1:10:17] can throw at us not to mention the
[1:10:20] Temptations of the world that you all
[1:10:21] face you all are facing more temptation
[1:10:23] and greater Temptation than I faced in
[1:10:25] my day maybe I'm not that old but just
[1:10:28] in 10 years A lot changes a lot of
[1:10:31] Temptation change the devil has greater
[1:10:33] access into your home than he did when I
[1:10:35] was a kid but you were put here to
[1:10:38] overcome him in this age you're not put
[1:10:41] in this age wrong you don't you weren't
[1:10:43] put in here that God just send you
[1:10:44] through and help you make it on the
[1:10:46] other side but God already saw you
[1:10:48] walking in total Victory right by a
[1:10:51] prophet's Vision he already saw a bride
[1:10:54] without spot he didn't say it would just
[1:10:56] be old people he saw a bride walking in
[1:10:59] this age without spot without sin above
[1:11:04] reproach not letting the devil work
[1:11:06] through their life he saw a bride made
[1:11:08] up of you and me walking in step with
[1:11:10] the word that's why we were given this
[1:11:12] word in this age so that we could
[1:11:15] overcome them in every situation under
[1:11:17] any
[1:11:18] circumstance now tell me what what what
[1:11:20] is greater than
[1:11:22] God is your doubt greater than God is
[1:11:26] your is your depression greater than God
[1:11:28] how about that anxiety you fight is it
[1:11:29] greater than God no but your faith must
[1:11:32] be put into action to recognize that God
[1:11:34] is not coming God is already here living
[1:11:38] in me to tell he's alive and well he
[1:11:41] already defeated that same enemy 2,000
[1:11:44] years ago why don't you let him defeat
[1:11:46] him again today why don't you let that
[1:11:48] word of God strike a seed in here and
[1:11:50] let him defeat that enemy again today
[1:11:53] amen but we can't survive by a fire of
[1:11:56] yesterday if I drew you a picture of a
[1:11:59] nice flame and I put it out here would
[1:12:01] you get any warmth from it it wouldn't
[1:12:03] give you one bit of warmth but you have
[1:12:05] need of fire you know that you're cold
[1:12:07] you know that your hands are cold you
[1:12:08] want to get somewhere where there's a
[1:12:10] fire if I paint you a picture of it it
[1:12:12] doesn't do anything for you let me say
[1:12:14] just to know that the pillar of fire
[1:12:16] came and it was over brother Mam's head
[1:12:18] it doesn't do anything for you if you
[1:12:19] don't recognize that it's right here in
[1:12:21] our midst in this hour it wasn't just
[1:12:24] back in 19 1963 when he was caught up
[1:12:28] it's right here in this hour the angel
[1:12:31] of Lord didn't leave he's right here in
[1:12:33] this
[1:12:34] building but why would he come in here
[1:12:36] if he's just going to sit there and let
[1:12:38] you go through the same old dry routine
[1:12:41] and be stuck in the same old rut that
[1:12:43] you've been stuck in service in and
[1:12:45] service out Waiting for God to do I sure
[1:12:47] wish God would come in here and do
[1:12:49] something
[1:12:50] miraculous brother well what hinders you
[1:12:53] come on brother why not you why not let
[1:12:57] it shine on you why not let the Revival
[1:13:00] come down and hit you could you imagine
[1:13:01] this brother BR somebody standing at the
[1:13:04] platform saying the baptism the Holy
[1:13:06] Ghost Divine Healing that's for another
[1:13:08] day it's like trying to introduce a man
[1:13:10] to freezing death freezing to death and
[1:13:13] paint him some fire for him and say
[1:13:15] that's a fine fire that's what was you
[1:13:18] can't warm by a painted fire you can't
[1:13:21] warm by a by a by a religion that died
[1:13:24] 60 years ago if you're basing on the man
[1:13:26] William brandham it's a painted fire
[1:13:28] you've got to recognize where the word
[1:13:30] is today that was fire at one time but
[1:13:34] what about fire now holy ghost had power
[1:13:37] at Pentecost for the first age second
[1:13:39] age and on down what about this age he's
[1:13:42] the same Holy Ghost today the same power
[1:13:45] the same signs the same wonders the same
[1:13:47] Miracles somebody say same same if he
[1:13:51] can get the same kind of faith amongst
[1:13:54] the people God doesn't change if he can
[1:13:57] get the same kind of Faith you know that
[1:14:00] if you were in that Upper Room on that
[1:14:02] day you would not act any different than
[1:14:03] you are right
[1:14:05] now it's not in a greater portion back
[1:14:07] then there wasn't just a greater
[1:14:09] outpouring of his presence back then you
[1:14:12] know if you were in brother bram's
[1:14:13] meetings you would not act any different
[1:14:14] than you are right now you know brother
[1:14:16] brandom came up in here and brother Wade
[1:14:18] was doing the introduction he said I
[1:14:19] have a special treat for you today
[1:14:21] Reverend William brandom was to come out
[1:14:23] to the pulpit do you know you would not
[1:14:25] act any different than you are right
[1:14:27] now maybe you
[1:14:30] don't but I'm going to tell you that's
[1:14:32] the truth he said Jesus couldn't heal
[1:14:34] you anymore if he was standing here in
[1:14:37] his Corporal body than he could right
[1:14:40] now because the power which he left is
[1:14:43] what what was in him to heal the sick to
[1:14:45] begin with that same power is here in
[1:14:47] the Church of the Living God that same
[1:14:50] fire is here that was in the upper room
[1:14:52] that same anointing that was on William
[1:14:54] Bram is here there's only one perfect
[1:14:56] gift sent to every age that gift is
[1:14:58] coming on but that same power is here in
[1:15:01] the church prophesying speaking in
[1:15:04] tongues uh uh uh Healing The Sick we've
[1:15:08] witnessed it just this year I witness
[1:15:09] every gift work in the church accurately
[1:15:11] amen amen God is not dead that's right
[1:15:15] he's not he's not backed up he's not
[1:15:17] dwindled in faith or dwindled in power
[1:15:20] he's waiting for somebody to use the
[1:15:22] same faith
[1:15:24] the same Faith they would come under
[1:15:25] that anointing and under that anointing
[1:15:27] brother say you feel that there's a
[1:15:28] connection between us you feel that
[1:15:30] there's something taking place between
[1:15:32] us you've stepped into the presence of
[1:15:35] the Angel you feel that I've stepped
[1:15:38] into that same presence I know exactly
[1:15:41] what that angel feels like I know
[1:15:42] exactly what they were feeling when they
[1:15:43] came under that you say well brother you
[1:15:45] weren't there I just just last year
[1:15:48] there was a meeting up at Nathan Bryan's
[1:15:49] church and there was a sister there that
[1:15:51] went to brandom Tabernacle and in that
[1:15:53] meeting she said afterward she came and
[1:15:55] she talked to brother Wayne She says
[1:15:57] this is the same anointing the same
[1:15:59] feeling was in this building that it was
[1:16:01] under brother brandom's meetings see it
[1:16:03] wasn't any different or any lesser it
[1:16:05] felt exactly the same a holy hush came
[1:16:07] across and and the power of God was
[1:16:09] moving and and the sick were being
[1:16:11] healed it's the same anointing why
[1:16:13] because it wasn't William brandom's
[1:16:14] anointing it was an angel's anointing
[1:16:17] and that same Angel is here but why
[1:16:20] would he be here if he's not going to
[1:16:21] change you why would he be here if he's
[1:16:24] going to send you out with the same old
[1:16:26] the same old burden you had on you when
[1:16:27] you walked in this building he's here to
[1:16:29] change your life he's here to heal the
[1:16:32] sick he's here to save the Lost he's
[1:16:35] here to restore that which was broken
[1:16:37] he's here to mend it that heart that's
[1:16:39] been hurt and it's been questioned and
[1:16:41] you're and you're wondering and you're
[1:16:42] struggling he's here to set it
[1:16:45] straight if we could just have the same
[1:16:47] Faith but we can't get warmed up by a
[1:16:50] fire that somebody told you about I can
[1:16:52] tell you that we built a huge bonfire I
[1:16:54] can tell you testimonies right now of
[1:16:56] what the Lord's doing but you've got to
[1:16:58] have your own testimony but it might
[1:17:00] build your faith that you could say well
[1:17:01] there's it's possible it's possible in
[1:17:04] this hour that somebody's building a
[1:17:06] bonfire there's a bonfire out there
[1:17:09] somewhere brother Wade's not crazy he
[1:17:11] knows that there's a fire there's a fire
[1:17:13] happening in his soul and that's what
[1:17:15] he's trying to express across the pulpit
[1:17:17] hey get in the fire while it's hot this
[1:17:20] is a real fire you could get warm you
[1:17:22] can get lit come and get in the fire I
[1:17:25] like that brother Brown said if you
[1:17:26] don't have something to say just tell
[1:17:28] them how your candle got lit but I think
[1:17:30] a lot of times men get behind the pulpit
[1:17:31] and they never lit their candle so don't
[1:17:33] got anything to share but but I'm here
[1:17:35] to tell you how my candle got lit is by
[1:17:37] coming under the authority of this word
[1:17:39] in this hour by recognizing that it's
[1:17:41] not just a letter on paper but it's
[1:17:43] alive alive in beings alive in flesh
[1:17:47] alive in lips and feet in hands it's not
[1:17:50] just just saying uh Lord take these
[1:17:52] hands
[1:17:54] dance not just a nice song but it's a
[1:17:57] literal life of Jesus Christ Living in
[1:18:00] men today living in women today
[1:18:02] testifying of his works and his goodness
[1:18:05] you do not have to walk out of here with
[1:18:07] whatever you walked in with you might
[1:18:09] have walked in this room carrying a
[1:18:10] burden of Doubt of question of unbelief
[1:18:12] of wondering what's going to happen to
[1:18:14] to that so and so or wondering what's
[1:18:16] going to happen to you when you I say
[1:18:17] it's time to kick that devil out I say
[1:18:20] we've given up too much already I say
[1:18:23] we've given away the boundary too much
[1:18:25] already we've let the devil take and
[1:18:26] take and take and take I say it's time
[1:18:29] to take back what the enemy stole from
[1:18:32] you come on masas and daddies you know
[1:18:34] what I'm talking about it's time to take
[1:18:36] back what the enemy stole from you he's
[1:18:39] encroached on your children he's
[1:18:40] encroached in your life he's encroached
[1:18:42] on on these young people sitting here no
[1:18:44] doubt many of your parents are sitting
[1:18:45] back there pulling for you it's time to
[1:18:47] take back what the enemy stole from
[1:18:50] you it's yours it's yours to have it's
[1:18:54] not something a far out that's above
[1:18:56] your reach it's right here the angel
[1:18:59] moving in our midst right not just so we
[1:19:02] could argue about it or we could feel a
[1:19:04] little emotional woo right but he's here
[1:19:07] to change lives
[1:19:09] right he's here to set that crooked
[1:19:12] straight amen now we might have
[1:19:15] disappointments where we've prayed to
[1:19:16] the Lord for things and they didn't come
[1:19:18] to pass and we waited and we've
[1:19:21] waited but he's here
[1:19:23] to change lives he's here to give you
[1:19:26] the desire of your heart you don't have
[1:19:28] to rely on your daddy's testimonies I
[1:19:30] remember growing
[1:19:31] up I remember growing up as a kid and my
[1:19:34] my my mom and dad came in the message
[1:19:35] back in California and and and they they
[1:19:38] would share these testimonies of things
[1:19:40] that would happen back in the church
[1:19:41] back then back in the 80s it seemed like
[1:19:43] we had a a real revival going through
[1:19:45] the message and there was supernal done
[1:19:47] and there was mighty works of God going
[1:19:49] on but then I was born in the late 80s
[1:19:51] and by the time I was hearing about it
[1:19:52] it was in the 90s
[1:19:54] and I'm thinking where are all the
[1:19:57] Miracles well that's nice it's nice that
[1:20:00] you have those stories I get so
[1:20:02] encouraged my dad say oh you should have
[1:20:04] been there in this meeting and the power
[1:20:05] of God fell and this happened and this
[1:20:07] happened and and then you just look at
[1:20:10] it and say well that must have been for
[1:20:11] another age that that must have been for
[1:20:13] another time gone by then you associate
[1:20:16] it with well you know maybe maybe the
[1:20:19] power of God following in a meeting like
[1:20:21] that was just in brother brandom's hour
[1:20:23] just brother brandom's time or uh maybe
[1:20:26] maybe those maybe those gifts were just
[1:20:28] extinguished out of the church or maybe
[1:20:29] Divine Healing doesn't exist anymore
[1:20:31] maybe those things just don't
[1:20:35] happen but eventually you get to a place
[1:20:37] where you recognize he's not
[1:20:39] changed his power's not decreased he's
[1:20:43] not changed the way he operates he's not
[1:20:45] changed his mind about his people he's
[1:20:46] not changed his mind about how he heals
[1:20:49] or how he delivers or how he shows up on
[1:20:50] the scene he's not changed his mind but
[1:20:52] the faith of men has got so mixed up in
[1:20:55] arguing about it now many of you were
[1:20:57] born into something that you didn't you
[1:20:59] didn't you didn't expect that to happen
[1:21:01] you were born into it right and you come
[1:21:03] into the middle of the scene if this is
[1:21:04] is am I okay good you come into the
[1:21:06] middle of the scene and there's quote
[1:21:09] Wars going on and there's battling going
[1:21:11] on and and and You' fallen into this and
[1:21:14] all of a sudden you're just you didn't
[1:21:16] ask for this but there's a war between
[1:21:17] this pastor and that Pastor that you
[1:21:19] didn't even you weren't even there for
[1:21:21] but you heard about it and you think
[1:21:22] well I I'm on this side and you heard
[1:21:26] this quote well I I see it that way and
[1:21:28] you're born into a situation that you
[1:21:30] didn't have any control over but there
[1:21:32] will be somebody that overcomes that
[1:21:34] situation there will be somebody that
[1:21:36] actually looks at this word for
[1:21:38] themselves with their own eyes and say I
[1:21:40] take it for what it is I didn't ask for
[1:21:43] this opinion I didn't ask for this doubt
[1:21:45] or this question or this we don't we
[1:21:47] don't read that quote that way well let
[1:21:49] me ask how many quotes can you cut out
[1:21:51] before you've cut the whole thing out I
[1:21:53] say it's time for the the Church of the
[1:21:55] Living God and I I think it's going to
[1:21:57] come through these young people here
[1:21:58] that's going to recognize I'll take the
[1:22:00] whole message nothing but the message I
[1:22:03] won't cut it I won't trim it I won't
[1:22:05] water it down I Want It All I Want It
[1:22:08] All I want him out of my house I want
[1:22:10] him out of my life I want it
[1:22:13] all but you see because we're born into
[1:22:16] the middle of this we have a
[1:22:18] Superstition built up about about how we
[1:22:20] can act about what we can do about what
[1:22:23] Liberty we can have right we don't want
[1:22:25] to get too crazy you don't to be
[1:22:27] Wildfire I you you want to be
[1:22:31] Wildfire you want to be you w be crazy
[1:22:33] like brother Wade and brother
[1:22:35] Ronnie there see we've put a cap
[1:22:39] unknowingly on how we can operate under
[1:22:42] the influence of an Angel we think we
[1:22:44] have to live under these expectations
[1:22:46] under this under this type of anointing
[1:22:48] and that's as far as we'll ever get but
[1:22:50] but but the word did not tell you that
[1:22:53] this message did not tell you that you
[1:22:55] can only live this high this message did
[1:22:57] not come to tell you that you can only
[1:22:59] have just this much water or this much
[1:23:02] of of the of the Life of Christ but this
[1:23:04] message came to say he's here in
[1:23:06] fullness he's the same yesterday today
[1:23:09] and forever and all that God was he
[1:23:11] poured into Christ and all that Christ
[1:23:13] was he poured into his church all
[1:23:16] somebody say all is in the church in
[1:23:19] this hour we're not waiting for it to be
[1:23:21] poured out it's already in the church
[1:23:24] we've got to recognize we're moving in
[1:23:26] step with the word time for those old
[1:23:29] shackles to fall off time for that old
[1:23:32] giant I don't see myself as a
[1:23:33] grasshopper I see myself as a king and
[1:23:36] priest already in the kingdom of God I'm
[1:23:39] a Son of God you're a daughter of God
[1:23:40] you're entitled to every Redemptive
[1:23:43] right but if you don't recognize who's
[1:23:45] here it's like you're in another kingdom
[1:23:48] wandering around I wish my dad was here
[1:23:51] remember when you were a k kid when
[1:23:52] you're real real little and you say well
[1:23:53] my dad can beat up your
[1:23:55] dad and my daddy see he has a better job
[1:23:58] than your
[1:23:59] Daddy my daddy's truck's bigger than
[1:24:02] your daddy but you see the whole time
[1:24:04] daddy's not around you're just saying
[1:24:06] things and all the while you're you're
[1:24:08] thinking I hope Daddy shows
[1:24:10] up I hope my big brother shows up I'm
[1:24:12] sure talking a lot of trash I want big
[1:24:14] brother to be here to back me up see
[1:24:16] that's what it's like when you're
[1:24:17] walking around in this Kingdom and
[1:24:18] you're unaware of who you are you're
[1:24:21] saying these things are POS possible
[1:24:23] you're saying that the days of Miracles
[1:24:24] is not passed and that God's still alive
[1:24:27] today and that this message is alive and
[1:24:29] true but if you have any element of
[1:24:32] doubt in there you're thinking I sure
[1:24:33] hope the pastor gets here pretty soon I
[1:24:35] sure hope so and so Minister shows up
[1:24:37] here pretty soon or I sure hope brother
[1:24:39] Brandon would come back and write this
[1:24:40] or where's where's where's somebody to
[1:24:42] back me up here but you've got to
[1:24:44] recognize that you are already a citizen
[1:24:46] in that Kingdom and your word is just as
[1:24:49] sure as any word that's come before you
[1:24:52] through the the prophets your word is
[1:24:54] just like his word you've been adopted
[1:24:56] once you come into this Holy
[1:24:58] Ghost I believe we recognize that we've
[1:25:01] been taught it we've been we've been
[1:25:03] we've been quoted it but one day we're
[1:25:06] going to live it one day we're going to
[1:25:08] break through that barrier to say this
[1:25:10] isn't my daddy's testimonies this isn't
[1:25:12] just something a far off or that we used
[1:25:14] to hear about or I wish I lived in this
[1:25:17] day but you'll be able to walk and say
[1:25:18] I'm living in the best day that there
[1:25:20] ever has been I'm walk walking in a
[1:25:22] greater light than there ever has been
[1:25:24] I'm walking in complete perfected word
[1:25:28] that's where we're coming to recognize
[1:25:29] friends you were you young people you
[1:25:31] were born into the best age in my
[1:25:33] opinion that there ever was brother R

[1:26:24] I'm not going to settle for just having
[1:26:26] this much I want it all I say if there's
[1:26:29] more of him to have I want it all now we
[1:26:33] can pass the mic and say do you believe
[1:26:34] that there's more of God for you to have
[1:26:36] in your life everyone would say yes I
[1:26:38] want more of God I want it all I want
[1:26:42] the devil so far removed from my life
[1:26:45] that the indwelling of God is radiating
[1:26:47] out of my
[1:26:48] being that I can walk in perfect faith
[1:26:51] that I can walk in perfect victory that
[1:26:53] the things I only imagined would be
[1:26:55] possible would be a reality to me I want
[1:26:57] it all I don't want to settle for just
[1:27:00] what the devil handed me I want a total
[1:27:02] Victory some you say me some you say
[1:27:06] it's mine I want a total Victory well
[1:27:09] let me say that he's here and he's here
[1:27:12] to give you a total Victory you don't
[1:27:14] have to walk out of here with the same
[1:27:15] old regret that I wish I would have done
[1:27:18] something when you walk out of these
[1:27:20] doors but you can settle it e even
[1:27:23] now settle it don't live by a painted
[1:27:26] fire don't live by something that you've
[1:27:28] heard is possible or you heard happen
[1:27:31] let's manifest it in your life let's see
[1:27:33] the manifestation of this message come
[1:27:35] out in the life of a young person in
[1:27:38] this hour say I want to be that person I
[1:27:40] want to be that young person this hour
[1:27:42] that lives this word so so real that it
[1:27:45] becomes manifested in me that's our
[1:27:48] desire as Believers we're not here just
[1:27:49] to battle back and forth and quote Shake
[1:27:51] hand see what you wore today see how
[1:27:53] well you sing and how good your pitch
[1:27:55] was we're here to
[1:27:57] Manifest this word that we live
[1:28:00] for when did it become a tradition to
[1:28:03] give what the devil gave you just to
[1:28:04] settle for it just to walk in that think
[1:28:08] about old
[1:28:09] Joshua when he recognized I'm not a
[1:28:11] brick layer I'm not a brick maker
[1:28:14] there's something greater in me than
[1:28:16] just making these bricks you see it
[1:28:18] become tradition to those Israelites
[1:28:20] that they just make bricks right yeah
[1:28:22] when they come to kades Baria and the 10
[1:28:24] spies went over and they brought back a
[1:28:26] report it had become tradition for them
[1:28:28] to walk around in the desert and eat
[1:28:29] Manana and live under their privileges
[1:28:32] it had become a tradition for them God
[1:28:35] forbid that it become a tradition in the
[1:28:37] Church of the Living God just to take
[1:28:39] what you're given in this life just to
[1:28:41] take what the devil handed to you and
[1:28:42] say that's all I can get this is all I'm
[1:28:45] meant to be what if Joshua and Caleb
[1:28:47] would have had the same vision that
[1:28:48] those other 10 spies had they'd still be
[1:28:50] in kadish Baria they'd still be
[1:28:52] wandering around but there was something
[1:28:54] greater inside them they recognized this
[1:28:57] is our day this is our hour I will not
[1:28:59] settle for wandering around in the
[1:29:01] wilderness I have a land over there it's
[1:29:05] my land they didn't even see Giants they
[1:29:08] saw their land this is the land that
[1:29:10] that Abraham lived in this is the land
[1:29:12] that Isaac lived in this is our land and
[1:29:16] there's a squatter sitting in your
[1:29:18] land and you might think I'm just crazy
[1:29:20] why you why are you yelling and why are
[1:29:22] you screaming because I've recognized
[1:29:24] I've tasted of the grapes I've seen that
[1:29:27] there's a better land for you than where
[1:29:29] you're living you've got to recognize
[1:29:30] it's your
[1:29:32] land well I you I
[1:29:35] just you see yourself as a grasshopper
[1:29:39] you've got to recognize you're an
[1:29:40] anointed called appointed elected
[1:29:44] inspired son and daughter of God to take
[1:29:47] back what the devil has already stolen
[1:29:49] from you it's your property right when
[1:29:52] did God come in here and and through the
[1:29:54] message or Through the Bible tell you
[1:29:56] that Joy was not
[1:29:57] yours anybody anybody got quote for me
[1:30:01] that Joy is not yours anybody got quote
[1:30:04] that you just have to be sad all the
[1:30:06] rest of your days anybody got a quote
[1:30:08] where you got to live in the Gloom all
[1:30:09] the rest of your life me have a
[1:30:17] quote and yet we live in that and yet we
[1:30:20] settle for that anybody you have a quote
[1:30:22] where you'd have to live with this
[1:30:23] disease the rest of your life anybody
[1:30:25] have a quote where you'd have to live in
[1:30:27] unbelief for the rest of your days
[1:30:29] brother you have a quote you no why
[1:30:32] because it doesn't exist because God
[1:30:34] promised you greater things than walking
[1:30:36] in this Leo to see and condition God
[1:30:38] promised you that you'd walk out in a
[1:30:40] perfect body God promised you that you'd
[1:30:42] walk out without sin without wrinkle
[1:30:44] without spot God promised you something
[1:30:47] greater than what this devil handed you
[1:30:49] in this age we've got to recognize it's
[1:30:51] me
[1:30:52] it's right now now's my time this is my
[1:30:55] hour my anointing the presence of God is
[1:30:58] here to change me from what I walked in
[1:31:00] that door with it's your time don't just
[1:31:04] live on somebody else's testimony have
[1:31:07] your own
[1:31:08] testimony here a couple months ago I was
[1:31:10] in Australia remember I said maybe maybe
[1:31:12] sharing a testimony it let you know that
[1:31:13] there's a fire out there being
[1:31:16] built I was in Australia a couple months
[1:31:18] ago and there was a young man there I
[1:31:21] was about my age May a little bit
[1:31:22] younger and we we talked he's from
[1:31:23] America ends up in Australia and uh
[1:31:26] through circumstances he running from
[1:31:28] the Lord ends up in Australia ends up in
[1:31:30] backing a mess his church in Australia
[1:31:32] see you can't run from the Lord you can
[1:31:35] try but if you're elected you cannot
[1:31:37] outrun him he'll find you worried about
[1:31:40] your prodigal brother or sister he'll
[1:31:42] find him they can't outrun the reach of
[1:31:44] the Lord and so this man finds himself
[1:31:46] there in in Australia and he's helping
[1:31:48] out in the church a good brother just a
[1:31:50] wonderful wonderful man man to be around
[1:31:52] you just feel a uh just a kindred spirit
[1:31:55] there after I got done preaching one
[1:31:57] night I was walking I was walking out
[1:32:00] and he had the they had a camp a youth
[1:32:02] camp set up and so the audio was kind of
[1:32:04] in an odd place over on the on the side
[1:32:06] of the building and so I was walking out
[1:32:07] towards the back door and and I see him
[1:32:10] coming I think oh he's going to ask me
[1:32:11] if I need a water or he's gonna and as
[1:32:13] he gets closer to me I can see that he's
[1:32:15] he's affected by the presence that's in
[1:32:17] the
[1:32:17] room and he comes up to me he says I've
[1:32:20] got to have
[1:32:22] what you have I need that I've got to
[1:32:25] have it and here he's born and raised in
[1:32:28] a message church I've got to have that
[1:32:30] you think well if I go out in the world
[1:32:32] maybe I'll have a better testimony
[1:32:33] that's what happened to him and he came
[1:32:34] back in he still said I've got to have
[1:32:37] what you
[1:32:39] have friends the Lord is still giving
[1:32:41] new births I watched one happen right
[1:32:44] there on the floor I I we didn't we
[1:32:45] didn't crawl through it or we didn't
[1:32:47] squeeze our way through it I simply said
[1:32:49] Silver and Gold Have I None but that
[1:32:51] which I have I give unto you in the name
[1:32:54] of Jesus and a wave of anointing came
[1:32:56] down and he has forever changed he just
[1:32:58] preached his first sermon last week you
[1:33:01] see what God's doing in this
[1:33:03] hour you're not just meant to hold on to
[1:33:05] whatever you're dealt the cards you're
[1:33:07] dealt with is not what you're ended up
[1:33:08] with you can change your circumstance
[1:33:11] you can change your atmosphere around
[1:33:12] you by simply saying I've got to have
[1:33:14] something more that I currently have
[1:33:16] I've got to have something greater than
[1:33:18] just knowing God sent a prophet or or
[1:33:20] knowing the quotes or knowing that our
[1:33:22] pastor is a good man I've got to know
[1:33:23] him I've got to know the author I've got
[1:33:26] to recognize him I've got to have him
[1:33:28] living in me that's where we've got to
[1:33:30] get to if we're ever going to overcome
[1:33:32] the devil in this age I believe we will
[1:33:35] I believe we are I believe it's by the
[1:33:37] bride that we're recognizing this is not
[1:33:39] yesterday's light absolutely amen but
[1:33:42] we're walking in a different maturity
[1:33:45] that's why I'm not preaching to you like
[1:33:47] your kids cuz you're walking in another
[1:33:49] level of maturity the 11 11th Hour
[1:33:52] worker understands it at the same
[1:33:54] level is that all right the same pay
[1:33:57] we're not getting money here the 11th
[1:33:59] Hour worker understands it at the same
[1:34:02] level as those that have been delving
[1:34:04] their life into it for for years and
[1:34:06] years and years but you give me you give
[1:34:09] me a nine-year-old that's been raised in
[1:34:11] a good messes church and he'll out
[1:34:13] preach any Theologian out there in any
[1:34:15] denomination I he'll out preach a Joel
[1:34:17] ostein or a TD Jake or whoever you give
[1:34:20] him
[1:34:22] a Paul waser come on give me another
[1:34:24] name he'll out preach any one of those
[1:34:26] preachers because the authority that
[1:34:28] we've been given in this hour is a
[1:34:30] greater light than they could ever
[1:34:31] imagine to attain and yet we're the ones
[1:34:34] living under
[1:34:37] privileges my friends I didn't just come
[1:34:39] out here to yell at
[1:34:41] you but I am sick and tired of watching
[1:34:45] The Devil trample all over God's people
[1:34:48] to take victories away from God's people
[1:34:50] to to hand hand him a card that says
[1:34:52] you're depressed to hand him a card that
[1:34:54] says you're anxious to hand him a card
[1:34:56] that says you won't sleep tonight I
[1:34:58] refuse to accept that from the devil I
[1:35:00] say it's ours and it's time to kick him

[1:35:05] out of your mind kick him out of your of
[1:35:06] your world your circumstance you have
[1:35:09] control over that and you might go home

[1:35:14] I don't know but you have the ability
[1:35:17] within you to have the Fai to say I am

[1:35:23] it's for me this is my victory not

[1:48:43] Victorious over the death hell and Grave

[1:48:46] have to be what participants of that
[1:48:50] we're going to have to take that and
[1:48:52] like brother Ronnie said we're going to
[1:48:53] have to live it he he doesn't know that
[1:48:55] our whole theme for this whole year has
[1:48:57] been what let it out good or bad
[1:49:01] whatever you got in let it out if it's
[1:49:03] good you need to let it out and show the
[1:49:04] world if it's bad you need to get it out
[1:49:06] so here he comes and talk about kicking
[1:49:08] it out so we appreciate that amen so

[1:49:18] up for Jesus Christ right amen amen
[1:49:21] we're Victorious this world has no

[1:49:29] thing this world can brag on well yeah

[1:49:32] games and winning this
[1:49:35] temporary eternal life is not
[1:49:38] temporary eternal life is eternal and
[1:49:41] that's what we're talking about that's
[1:49:42] what brother Ronnie was talking about
[1:49:43] today and uh really good let's give our
[1:49:45] brother a big hand amen you believe what
[1:49:48] he
[1:49:49] said
[1:49:51] I'm like Dad always says I believe he
[1:49:52] believes what he said anyway am man
[1:49:54] whether you do or not I believe he
[1:49:56] believes what he said we need to enter
[1:49:58] in um I was thinking about that I was
[1:50:00] laughing while you were preaching I
[1:50:02] preached a sermon 20 years ago on 10
[1:50:04] line
[1:50:05] preachers that's what it was there was
[1:50:08] 10 there was 10 there was 12 went across
[1:50:10] 10 come back and they lied they were
[1:50:12] liars and they were preachers because
[1:50:14] they made the people like you said they
[1:50:16] made the people stay there for 40 years
[1:50:19] 10 people that said we are
[1:50:22] grasshoppers then there had to be a
[1:50:24] Joshua generation like you're saying the
[1:50:26] Joshua generation had to raise up a
[1:50:28] young group of people Amen to carry us
[1:50:31] on and but now remember I want to I want
[1:50:33] to make something clear Joshua was young
[1:50:35] but Caleb was an old
[1:50:37] guy us old people can do it too amen
[1:50:41] Caleb was 80 something years old okay
[1:50:44] right and he said he was Stronger now
[1:50:46] than he was 40 years ago how many y'all
[1:50:48] can say that don't raise your hand and
[1:50:49] you lie
[1:50:51] yeah but you know what I believe Caleb
[1:50:54] probably had aches and pains and and
[1:50:56] needed some Len and gerol and everything
[1:50:59] else but you know what in his Spirit he
[1:51:01] was just as young as he was cuz you know
[1:51:03] what he had a promise you and I have a
[1:51:05] promise amen we have a promise that this
[1:51:08] group as brother Ronnie said this group
[1:51:09] is going to defeat the Devil and like I
[1:51:12] said many times before I'm just dumb
[1:51:14] enough to believe I'm going to do it I'm
[1:51:17] just dumb enough to put myself in a
[1:51:18] place to where God can speak to me and I
[1:51:21] can help God I don't God don't need any
[1:51:23] help but you know what he chose us he
[1:51:26] chose us to help him he chose us like I
[1:51:27] said we're his
[1:51:29] victory him dying on the cross and going
[1:51:31] to Calvary and and getting being
[1:51:33] resurrected has nothing to
[1:51:36] do if you're not doing it in you if it's
[1:51:38] not doing it inside of you we've got to
[1:51:41] what make manifest what he's already
