[17:48] brother Lewis's father and mother
[17:53] I think his sister doesn't have a

[17:57] to Lewis but as far as sisters usually
[18:02] no she's got she's got okay she's got
[18:05] better okay all right you know go
[18:08] interpret that there's no need okay all
[18:13] right well good to be in the house of
[18:15] Lord to do in this thing like I said sin
[18:16] you're doing good to be a Christian we
[18:18] wanted to say to Cristiano good to be
[18:20] standing where we're standing we would
[18:21] instead put out another stylist and
[18:23] while we're standing and I got a couple
[18:25] announcements I need to make I said
[18:26] scepters I know and see us on Wednesday
[18:29] night now Jim usually cleans the church
[18:33] on Tuesday to get to services in you're
[18:36] gonna you got cleaned either Tuesday or
[18:38] Thursday and what happens on Wednesday
[18:42] night is a lot of you parents so I'm
[18:43] talking to you with small children a lot
[18:46] of your children pull toys out in the
[18:49] Sunday School classes downstairs and
[18:50] don't put them back so you're
[18:53] responsible for your children your
[18:55] children I hope that's not grown-ups
[18:57] down there playing with those toys okay
[18:59] so so families with children needs to go
[19:03] through because this morning when Ana
[19:06] walked in her Sunday school class there
[19:08] was not just two or three toys there was
[19:10] twenty or thirty toys scattered all over
[19:12] the floor
[19:13] where some child had played with it
[19:15] Wednesday night and didn't put it back
[19:18] up so just just make sure you if your
[19:20] kids play with toys which they will so
[19:22] just have them put them back up on
[19:24] Wednesday all right that okay all right
[19:27] say ma'am also we need to remember
[19:31] sister

[19:37] her and in the island of Trinidad
[19:41] brother Stephen Julian everybody knows
[19:42] brother Steve remember his son got shot
[19:44] in the head while he passed away
[19:45] Thursday so talked to him on the phone
[19:48] just a few minutes ago talked to brother
[19:50] Joseph so he's okay but the I didn't
[19:54] understand it but the boy lives in New
[19:56] York and it was a road rage event in New
[19:59] York I've got the article in the back
[20:01] and they do have a suspect so they got
[20:03] out was fighting and got he got shot in
