Christmas week people be traveling Lord keep each person safe on the highways Lord keep us safe from from sickness and all the fevers and flus that's going around Lord we ask you to be with brother Dale Lord and help him with his cough and take that thing away from him Lord we pray Lord that that will go away and leave him alone Satan you're defeated you might come among us but you can't stay here you are a defeated creature and in the name of the Lord Jesus we pray that each one of you that's been sick with good to see sister Anna back again with us he's been sick Lord and I pray the ones that are sick that home Lord that we have not mentioned sister Freda and different ones that are not here today that you would Minister to them Father as the word Goes Forth while they're just grant us Lord Grace and Lord bring us to perfection bring us to Virtue knowledge Temperance all the way up the statue of perfect man Lord because without you we can't do anything just bless each one father in Jesus name amen we've been on this for 76 times but I still I love reading the word of God and I love reading right there in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld as Glory the glory the only begotten of the father full of grace and what truth Luke 6 verse 19 says the whole multitude sought to touch him for there went virtue and that's what we're going to talk about today in this afternoon bring another couple of points in that we were thinking on this week and what virtue went out of him and healed them all Revelation 6 verse 1 and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and I heard it where the noise of Thunder one of the four beasts saying come and see and I saw him Behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a bow and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer you may be seated in the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word it is uh good to see sister Anna back with us oh it's been out sick thank God like Brother Anderson said it didn't get through the whole family the kids stayed good and everything's all right so we good with that all right so now what we've been talking about we've been talking about truth and we've been talking about also bringing in something that um that we all need to have and that strength we need to have power we need to have virtue we need to have power over the devil all right and we've been talking about the different things about truth and we're going to read here in brother brother Brown and layout of seeing Church age we've read it before and we've read it many many times brother Dale read this and he just kept reading it and reading when we were going through Revelations and different ones brother Brown says now this messenger Malachi 4 in Revelation 10 7. now you see there was two things that he came to do all right he came to do what restore the restore the faith of the fathers and from the beginning we'll talk about that a little bit more and then according to Revelations 10 7 break the seals or the seals come open which is The Headstone which is which is what the ministry of Jesus Christ just like it was 2000 years ago the truth not a truth but the truth everybody with me so number one hit what according to Malachi 4 he'll turn the hearts of the children that's one see brother Bradham can't change your heart God has to change your heart but he changed it through a message through a Ministry he changed our heart back to the thinking of the faith of the fathers that back to where Peter and Paul and the different one and Peter says look on us and and Paul says hey you know uh you followed me long enough devil get out of that woman and leave me alone or get out of that man and leave me alone all the different things because remember virtuous power virtue is not being a virgin we're going to talk about that this afternoon a couple of points I want you to realize one thing and I want you to think about this you look through the Bible and you look through some of the women some of the great women they talk about the great women of the Bible uh the rahabs the uh you got even even the woman at the well even you've got Ruth you Esther listen some of them weren't virgins some of them were well I'll raise your head up some of them were prostitutes but they're in the lineage of Jesus Christ they're Gentiles just like me and you and I'm going to read you a quote that I just found back there a few minutes ago that shocked me brother random said and I'll read it this afternoon Rahab is a type of the believer now how in the world can you can you place that without being a prophet and knowing what he's talking about because you and I were all prostitutes before we came to God I don't care if you were white lily virgin in your body you were a prostitute in your soul sorry about that but remember she became a Believer and God spared her life you became a believer in God prepared your life amen so thank God for Grace so number two he'll reveal the mysteries of the seven Thunders don't let that don't let that bother you we're going to get into that later on in Revelations 10 which what the Revelation is contained in the seal so when he opened the seals the Thunders broke so we don't have to wait for some Thunder to clap or or seven men or ever have whatever they were you know a long time ago they thought it had to be seven men with their voice no that's not what it was it's the voice of God speaking to you I I you know I love brother Doherty but if if the Lord speaks to him that's God speaking to him then God's got to speak to me in my way so that I can understand him all right brother Doherty may catch it like that may take me six months amen all right so two he'll reveal those Mysteries it'll be those revealed look mystery truths that literally turn the hearts of the children to the Pentecostal fathers now that those mystery truths are not water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus that was the faith of the fathers they taught Jesus Christ is water baptism they taught no eternal hell so that's these mystery truths he's talking about here are not trinitarian Doctrine but the first part of Malachi 4 is what took care of that when you come into the message of the hour when you got born again and we were talking about years you know about a year ago when you come in you have to get born again well when you get born again it's not born again in the message no you're not a message baby you're a Jesus Christ baby you're born again of the spirit of God and what does he leave you he leads you and guides you into all truthful he leads you into the Bible and then that will lead you to truth if it's the true New Birth so it'll have to be the message of the hour the first time you hear it you may question it but you get the new birth and you continue on then it's going to have to be that these truths from the part number one which is water baptism which is no eternal hell which is all the different things that brother Brown brought in the early part of his ministry but these Ministry truths is something that we're going to talk about and the seals and all the different things that we're going to talk about trying to weave it in a little bit because everybody everybody thought the first seal was why horse rider was the Holy Ghost even brother random caught it until God opened these mystery truths to him to literally turn us back to the faith of the fathers in other words change our body all right listen having all these virtues in your life will not change your body it will get you on the road to change your body but it will not change your body your body change will have to come from that headstone the son of man message and we'll get it to in a little while and bring the polls in because the third pull is to what a special group of people we'll talk about that in just a minute how's that going to fit in with this I'll show you in just a second just hang loose John 17 17 says sanctify them how are we going to get Sanctified by the truth brother round says Rahab was Sanctified by what believing the truth she said without even sin said she never saw listen to this she never saw um Joshua but she believed that God was with him in other words she told them we have been shaking in our boots since you crossed Jordan because somebody saw that great big Mighty Jordan open up and all you came walking across playing tambourine shouting and having a Pentecostal time y'all weren't scared but we are even Behind These great big walls that we built up we were scared but it Sanctified him when she took and put that Scarlet rope that's what saved them right that's what Sanctified them red blood Sanctified them and Joshua said hey if you see that red cord do not destroy that house amen that's the same way with me and you as somebody was saying the other day you know you as brother Ryan was talking about you going through life and you just you know happy-go-lucky and care of the world and everything blah blah blah blah that thing was over it was around there it was waiting on you to come to a place to where you stopped like Rahab stopped and said hey I believe what's coming we're getting we're going to be destroyed you know what I want you and every one of us to do this year I want you to be destroyed I'm destroyed at this several years ago the wrath of God was poured out on my soul everybody's going to come to the wrath of God you're either going to come to it here are you going to come to it over there that's right so I want to take it here yes I want to be sprinkled and covered by his blood I don't want him to be sprinkled with my blood let his blood be on us and our children you see how that got them people they got the blood of Jesus on them and they got what destroyed right all right I want to have I want to have his blood on me once once I come to a destruction that's why it's got to come to a new birth it's going to come to a death yes destroy me destroy me Lord oh no I want to be blessed and yeah I want to be blessed too but you got to destroy that old man first sanctify them through what thy truth Thy word is the truth as thou has sent me into the world even so I've sent them into the world you we've got to go into the world Listen Rahab was in the world she went to the world brother Brown said and I'll read it this afternoon she got caught in a trap in other words her parents maybe didn't have any money she had to go on the street and do what she was doing she was trapped well weren't you and I trapped into it hello somebody is what brother Ram said we were trapped into it we were trapped into this by our adulteress parent Eve and Adam but what happened was we found sanctification in the word of God where he can so sanctify you that even Rahab had a baby named Boaz and Boaz is a type of Christ coming to a gentile prostitute come on somebody yeah we're we preach Purity we preach but we preach Graves too if you don't see grace I told somebody was talking about the other day I'll promise you one thing if you can't extend Grace to somebody Grace has not been extended to you yet if you can't extend Grace to somebody it has not been extended to you yet because you can't understand Grace you understand law do this don't do that do this don't do that and for their sake I sanctify myself what did he do he Sanctified himself Jesus Christ did say look I'm not going to have that I'm not going to have a wife I'm not going to have family I'm not going to have this I'm going to have a bride yes by spiritual union not by natural Union by spiritual union look that way Satan can have nothing to do with it he can't defile this body because it's a spiritual body he can defile this body but he can't defile the one that's inside of Us Praise the Lord also might be Sanctified together you and I might be Sanctified what through the truth that's why the prophet of God had to bring us truth back had to restore truth so that he we could even get started right get by with me all right look now we're talking about the three different levels of man we got the outside which you see right now see which is sea tastes feel smelling here then you've got an inside guy which is a spirit that's what we've been talking about the past several months is those five senses memory reason conscious affection imagination that's that middle realm that Spirit realm that Satan can can get a shot he's got a shot at but so does God God got a shot you know what that one in the middle the control man is one fake or doubt today you're either Faith or you're doubt one of the two all right you're either born again you're either white or black inside your soul today you're not great there's no gray area with God a man you're either born again and have give your life and and let the wrath of God birth you or you're looking at the wrath of God if you don't get born again not just Bible I'm sorry if it hurts your feelings but it's the truth I'm telling you we got to come to a place to listen to a brother the other day and he's right these smiling Joel Olsteen preachers that Don't Preach against sins everybody's going to heaven you know we're going to have prostitutes in heaven and we're gonna have all these different you know everything's we're all going to heaven no we're not God is a jealous God God is an Angry God when you turn him down because he's going to give you 120 years and know it's time to rip 120 years and then not one person got saved except his household so the Inside Man is the spirit man which is controlled by five senses remember regions conscious imagination and then inside of you is what inside of that spirit is a saw in this controlled by one thing free will all right Free Will free moral agency everybody so you can't tell me his brother Ryan was covering today you know and it's hard to preach this because you you look at this you say well I always was eternal yes you were in the mind of God but I'm going to read your quote where brother Brown said you come to this world lost now what does that mean to you lost lost means lost it don't mean you got a little speck or something menu somewhere no way God won't dwell in an unclean vessel the things I did when I was a sinner and God was nowhere to be found except in his mind he said I know buddy I'm gonna get you in 1997. I'm gonna knock you off your feet and when I knock you off your feet I see and have this ready for you that you're gonna hear me and you're going to respond to me that's the that's to me that's Redemption to me that if it wasn't then it'd just be that God pulled you through a tube and said well I know you always had eternal life in your soul so I'm just gonna pull you through this too no you were lost yes why would you need a free will if you had God in your soul when you were born please you do away with Jesus you do away with what what the whole Plan of Redemption but the people in the message use it as something that makes us better than anybody else because we came with this special something else no we were special in the mind of God and then when we got born again and we got that old man died that old man got killed amen we became what not just children of God we became God we became part of his soul yes soul to soul but now we're working on the second realm or the memory reason conscious affects and Imagination now watch and that determines what spirit is in there if it's the spirit of God it'll feed on the things of God and it won't feed on anything of the world the prophet of God says now look now inside of that Spirit which you become when you're born in the earth and the Breath of Life is breathed into you look that spirit is of a worthy nature now is God a worldly nature anything of God a worldly nature I'm just reading you a quote the spirit is of a worldly nature because it was not given from God it was permitted by God amen that's why all babies go to heaven because he know you can't come to that free will place and he can give you eternal life but you're not bride no way nope only the redeemed that comes to full Redemption is considered bride yes they'll be Eternal yes they'll be in in the in the world to come but they will not be bride nobody with me now you got that for every child that's born in the world is born in what sin shaping and iniquity come to the world speaking lies that sounds really good but that's where we all were now look right here so that person inside there is a center to begin with inside where inside your soul where does unclean Spirit gets driven out of your soul and God won't dwell on an unclean battle you can't have God in Satan in the same place nope that's that old two Soul Doctrine they just wrapped it up in new new Christmas wrapping paper and fed it to the people of the message sorry about that but it does there's five outlets in the spirit and you can't think with your body you have to think with your spirit you can't have conscience in your body it has no mental faculty at all your body doesn't so you have to think with your spirit that's why I said all along don't worry about this guy well it's just my flesh's fault no it's not your flesh's fault no your flesh got here because your Mom and Daddy got together permitted by God got together and produced your body and then God put a soul inside of you for you to make a choice all right so it's the choice you make right but your body don't think you don't think or your body you only react I'm only reacting to what I know that I'm doing my hands like this they're not uncontrollable we're all controlled by something like I said before it didn't bother me to go open up a um go to the convenience store and open the thing up with this same hand grab a case of beer out and go drink it didn't bother me a bit so I was what thinking with my with my hand do my hand did what my spirit told it to do but now that I have the spirit of God in that same place now this hand opens the Bible and hopefully it is teaching and preaching the word of God and God didn't have to destroy this he just changed it amen he didn't destroy it he changed it he destroyed your own nature and then work so From the Inside Out Satan worked from the outside in that's the Battleground the greatest battle ever Falls in your mind but you don't think with your mind you think with your heart everybody with me so you have to think with your spirit you have to reason you can't reason with your physical being reason doesn't see taste feels smelling hair reason is what you can make in your mind if you're asleep or you're out your body is lying there dead but your spirit can still reason there's five senses that control that inside man that's stupid the not the center but the outside room now to the last man which is the soil there's only one sense as I said before today you're either lost or saved one of the two now you may be in the process all right you may be in the process of going through justification sanctification but sanctification does not put you in the body it cleans you up and sets you aside for service doesn't put you in service the baptism of the Holy Ghost is what puts you in service then you have to take that Holy Ghost though then you gotta fight come on you gotta fight that memory reason conscious affect your imagination because you know what Satan wants you to remember everything you did bad oh why I'm sorry am I the only one again oh okay but you got a free Mole agency reject well I didn't have a I had this I had this eternal life in me and and I didn't make a choice yeah you did make a choice you made a choice and God knew your choice therefore he had it waiting for you when you got here remember the prophet of God said he sends down your representation the woman at the well had representation from what predestination not from her mom and daddy not from the situation she was in because you know what that got saved sorry to say it like that that got saved brother Graham said she did God eternal life that's us we're not Lily white I'll promise you that not in our soul some people touched the Garment of Jesus was made well others smacked him in the face and hit him on the head so in other words here is two attitudes that comes to brother that comes to brother Jesus that comes to Jesus and you got Jesus being touched and the lady was healed and you got these Roman soldiers that was beating him over the head and saying hey tell us who hit you put a put a rope and put a thing around his face it's the attitude that you come in and we'll get down to the bottom because this is what I was this is something I want to insert right here it was obeying what God Said do now that's what these virtues are it's obeying what to do all right what brought the power we all need to be brought to that power which is called virtue because remember power is virtue not living a virgin Life we'll get to that this afternoon what brought the virtue is obedience to the word of God all right so the word of God is we've been talking about many times and we've all been covering about you know doing the right thing and coming to church and having an attitude that you want to come not that you've got to come right all right and I want to add something in there too if you don't mind coming to church doesn't mean just getting here three minutes for the service Stars boy now you're quiet some of y'all come wobbling in right when I come in that's not right that's not coming to church y'all sat out in the car and talk on the phone until you I get ready to preach then you come in here and show yourself no God sees more than that you need to be here praying you know why because you're going to bring some spirit inside with you if you don't get it out of here between there and you sitting down ain't gonna be no sitting downstairs either you say oh I'm tired well if you're sick you can sit downstairs if you're just gonna sit down there because you don't like sitting up here you can go home because you don't want to be here anyway because you know what you walk through those doors there's a spirit on you that spirit's gonna get exposed inside this building and it don't want to get exposed so it stays out there because I want you to look right here this is Samuel a prophet let me set the stage here this is Samuel that was just a little something we need to we need to sharpen our pencils we need to Sharp my pencils get here brother Brown said 20 minutes before the service starts and do what pray read your Bible not come hurrying in here two minutes before you're hindering the service yeah you are it's enough hindrance without all that okay so let's just try to get here and be a servant of God and a child of God and get to church on time you sure won't miss a doctor's appointment I promise you that you'll be there 15 minutes for the appointment just to make sure you don't miss it for them to tell you you're sick we're trying to give you the gospel to tell you you can get healed from that yeah come on first here we go thinking it's our thinking think ing you know I mean really we gonna rush to the doctor for him to tell you you got something wrong with you and then not come in here and say God I want to get rid of all that uh and you know what we don't charge a dime you pay your tithes to Jesus Christ you don't pay at the church okay and you'll go pay him 500 at the doctor's office to tell you sick well I'm gonna tell you for free you're well if you'll come here and do what God tells you to do amen because look watch this you say well I'm a believer I'm this I'm that watch this right here here is Samuel now what did Samuel tell Saul Samuel is what Samuel is a prophet he's the prophet of the day come on he's the prophet of the day all right and Saul is the king of the day that the people elected not God so Samuel says Saul you got to go to these two kings can't remember their name but you gotta go to these two kings Kill Them All come on Saul says y'all do it no problem well you know he doesn't but you know what Saul's excuse was sausage well I brought these two kings in maybe we can convert them oh well I'm gonna save some of these sheep and and goats for sacrifice Lord prophet no he didn't do what the prophet told him to do and you know what that you know what happened to Saul God took the kingdom away from him right there for not doing what the prophet said and Samuel said hi to Lord as great delight and burn offerings and sacrifice this is after Saul said hey I got all these animals because Samuel walks in and he goes he looks back in the room and there's two kings sitting back there in the prison when he comes in a little bit further and he hears the blading of sheep and and he hears the animals and he said what is this I hear him Saul sauce it all but like I said but we got some burnt offering here now we're just going to offer it to the Lord and we got these two kings back here and we're gonna we're gonna convert them you're gonna see what happened to him in just a second by a prophet not by General by a prophet he took Saul's sword and cut their head off and Simon said half the Lord is great delight and burnt offering the sacrifice as in obeying the voice of the Lord question mark behold to obey would I read down here obedience to the word of God behold to obey is better than sacrifice I mean the message I believe the prophet I believe this uh Lord I I know you know a little bit of this a little bit of that come on that doesn't mean that much no I'm like what brother Dale said he worried many times about why God told Israel to kill him even kill the babies this is our loving God he said take every one of those amalekites and kill them babies and all but you know what he was doing in our eyes it was a Slaughter and God's eyes was I'm going to save all them babies I can't do anything about these old people but I can save them babies and I can you know what if they would have done away with all the amalekites the amount of cops would have never bothered Israel again but since he let some of them go they bothered him the whole time it was like a brother Brown said a hair in the biscuit they just followed him along and it was trouble all the time well I'm talking about me and you we need to chop off all that stuff all that stuff needs to die don't divorce it and just say well I'll be good on Sunday and not on Monday behold to obey is better than sacrifice and to hearken listen to God than the fat of Rams for Rebellion that's what you are that's what I am and you are if we don't do what God says we rebel against his word yeah right mine the wrong crowd you're rebellious if you don't do what God said you're a rebel you're a rebel you're rebellious and you're not rebellious to me brother they don't know the ministry you're rebellious to God and brother Brandon we all we believe brother Brown was a prophet but I don't believe we need to be here 20 minutes before service starts well you're a rebel and you're what for Rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft in other words you're formulating your own idea you've got your old cauldron and you just you just put what in it you want to and you just Stir It Up that's Witchcraft and look and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry hmm boy that hurt all of us didn't it stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry because thou has rejected what the word the word rejected thee from being King Saul continued to be king but God never recognized it anymore he raised up David David's the King this is not the king this guy can't do what I said but even though David was a murderer David was a liar David was an adulterer God still said he's a man after my own heart he did not say this Saul was right even though Saul said I think we'll save a few of these and we'll sacrifice them and and we'll try to convert them to men and also said I mean Samuel said no give me a sword I think the Bible says he went and pulled the sword so he went Samuel this old prophet thank God he sent us a prophet with a sword in his hand and he went over there and he put his foot on one of them's neck and he took that one's head off put his foot on the other one's neck and took that one's head off and he handed that sword back to Saul and says you better do what God Said do from now on and walked out the door well if we'd have somebody do like that we'd be all upset about it but that's the word of God hey man let the sword of the word correct all the error brother Brian said look we're not building an organization I'm not here this morning to build an organization craft never sent me to build an organization he sent me to build what individuals I know for a fact this whole world's not going to get saved amen I know this whole world is not going to accept this message of the hour amen and I know there's a lot of people that's around the message that ain't gonna make it either but individuals individuals individuals some may be right here somebody somebody may be wanting waiting on me to go to knowledge or want me to head on up to a guidelines because that's where you're at but just be patient because what we're going to pull everybody up if we can that's what we're going to talk about in just a minute why did Brother Brown bring us three pulls pull not push we'll read it in just a second we'll get to it that'd be all right say Amen Christ at me to build individuals to the statue of Jesus Christ that they may be not that he may be the PowerHouse and the dwelling place of the Spirit by his word by his words he built up the individual to that place not built an organization to a greater denomination but build an individuals the Sons and Daughters of God that's the idea add to your faith first reverse your knowledge now you're coming to a place so let's talk about virtue just for a minute now we know we looked at the definition we're going to look at it again the sake of the ones who weren't here um good to see brother John's mom back there with us and sister Rebecca's Mama too yeah sorry both she got her kids here today good to see you Mom she played that tambourine love that Luke 6 verse 19 says the whole multitude sought to touch him for their virtue out of him and heal them all in other words it was strength that came out of Jesus they knew they knew his background this woman at the that had a blood issue she what she had to know his background because she said if I can only Touch the Hem of His Garment I'll be made wealth I can only touch him touch the Garment not him so he came up behind she came up behind him and touched the board of His Garment immediately her issue of blood stance Jesus said who touched me when they all denied it Peter said wait in a minute Lord everybody's touching you he said but Peter somebody's touched me special than what you're probably Peter had him by the by the arm and said Lord well that wasn't any virtue going out of that but that woman needed something Jesus said somebody had touched me for I perceive that virtue or strength is gone out of me and then when the woman saw that she was not hidden she came trembling following down before him and we know what happens to daughter be of good Comfort thy faith hath made thee whole go on peace praise the Lord can we do that today can we Touch the Hem of His Garment today and say God I got a need I don't have to see you I don't even have to hear you I just got to believe you I still believe what you've already said not what's coming up but what you already said all right and that word Virtue we know is the same thing as when he said power will be given to you from on high right before he ascended and came back on the Pentecost is that right which is dunamis which is what it's where we get to work Dynamite brother Bernie Villanueva wore this night wore this word out for years and years when he come here he loved that word dunamis which is power Mighty work strength strength power and ability inherent power power residing in a thing it's got to be in you before you can give it out all right you got to have money in the bank before you write the check some have tried it doesn't work all right let's go let's keep on going now here's what we do what's the first thing have faith and be born again that's laying the foundation we've been staying on faith for a long time listen you got to believe this is right message you've got to believe that I can't make you believe I can preach from now to Noah 120 years it's gonna rain next service it's gonna rain Wednesday night it's gonna rain Sunday it's gonna rain Sunday afternoon it's gonna rain 120 years Michael he preached that they don't tell how many tapes he had brother Adam had 1100 sermons in like 30 years he probably had six or seven thousand sermons and it all was on one thing it's gonna rain amen did it save anybody no eight people that's all that Art's gonna hold anyway coach God knew that okay everybody with me so you got to believe you got to take it into your heart and say look I believe not what I'm saying you believe what God's saying through me all right take out all the other stuff and just say look count that to my ignorance but if I tell you what the word of God says directly from the word of God you're not fighting me you're fighting God amen you're not fighting brother Dale you hadn't fought brother Dale all these years you've been fighting God all right that's what I believe amen that's what I believe all right you gotta believe the same thing brother Ryan was talking about all the what the word Lula meant and that was pretty neat I like that but listen it's not a place we can be just as lost as a blind dog in The Meat House they always say but if you're born again you're going to get something from God and God's obligated to get you to the right place he's obligated to what his word his word said I'll lead you and guide you into that was weak all trees all right not just some first you have faith then you add virtue to your faith this is the next column pour your foundation Faith then your faith at virtue now right there knocks a lot of us down yes sir add virtue to your faith that doesn't just mean living a virgin life that's what we're going to cover this afternoon because it is truly the word Virtue does connect to a virgin life and listen sisters if you were a virgin before you married if you're still a virgin now before you you met somebody you have power that 90 of this world has no idea what kind of power you hold that's right now some of us sisters come on now sisters and brothers that have got married and you're not a virgin anymore we know that's for a fact you hold a power inside of you sisters that brother Brown said you hold a virtue in you that no man can do anything with you're the only one that can control it you're the one that can say yes and I know we beat on the women all the time but you know what there's some there's some guys that needs to be virgins too you know okay we may have to talk about later on but not today all right because listen when we get to the when we get past the tax perfect man when we get into The Headstone you're gonna have to cover marriage indoors you got to cover some of those things that to keep yourself pure now that don't mean like I said before that don't mean well I'm a virgin I'm going to heaven no that don't mean that because God's got to transform you into a virgin in your soul not in your body there's no way you can reverse that Catholic church has tried to do it they try to reverse it and say that you're a virgin now and nothing gonna happen like the old saying once saved always say well no no if you're a virgin today count yourself one of the strongest women on the face of this Earth sister says amen this brother says Amen to keep yourself is a strength that this world does not know about because they want you to be a pervert from a time you're six or seven years old I hate to say that but it's the truth but that's not going to take you to heaven but it will help you to live a virgin life but you and I are supposed to be living the Virgin life ourselves men and women because I'm gonna read your quote here either today or tonight where brother Brown calls us The Virtuous sinless pride of Jesus Christ how do we get there well we did we did some way we're trying to get to it now by what faith virtue knowledge Temperance but it doesn't mean a virgin life you know like the woman or a man or so forth that doesn't have nothing to do with that all right it has nothing to do with that virtue right there brother Dale covered this many years ago about the meanings of these words in a worldly manner and the meanings and what brother Brown gave us and are totally different because this is for not going to cover but I'll just give you a little a little snippet brother Brown says two things that really stands out in my heart he says you know he said kissing was potential adultery wow and the sex glands are in your lips if you've ever kissed your wife you'll know that sorry but if you hadn't then you waited your husband and wife you her husband and wife don't play around and think you can get by with it because you're it's a connection they're not your sex glands but it's a connection to we'll get to that later on but we need to live clean we need to try our best to live as clean as we can all right I know this world just absolutely I mean you look over here and you see a naked woman and to get away from her you look over here and you see one worse so I mean you just bouncing off back and forth but you didn't say God you know what I say their soul if you'll save their soul we don't have to worry about that the Bible said virtue went out of him that's right congregation says amen if we're going to be like him we must have virtue then we must have it to be like him first song I ever loved to him was to be like Jesus well I'm going I'm if I'm going to be like Jesus I've got to have virtue and a past that it can pass forward from me to the people because virtue went out of him to the people virtue and before you can let it out you got to have it first amen you haven't got it it won't come out there's nothing for it to come out of it what if someone tried to draw first you out of us in the chat would return insufficient funds see no no none there to draw from check bounced somebody looking at you as a Christian and tomorrow see you out here carrying on like a sinner there's not much virtue can be drawn from that see right virtue must be in US yes and until we get virtue then when we get true virtue we can add it to our faith that's the next foundation wall first you must have the faith now listen I read you this quote long time ago prophet of God said faith alone won't do it faith alone won't do it you can stay a Christian you can be a Christian but you're just going to be defeated all the time I'm sorry you're just going to be defeated all the time if you don't grow into some of these virtues I'm sorry this is the way God set it up not me I just thank God that he sent us a prophet that could give us the ABCs and how to do this all right how to approach God I believe brother round I don't care if they call him whatever they want to call him he he gave me the ability to approach God in a way that's the truth did he you brought Clarity to me he didn't he didn't bring uh well I just believe brother Brown was a prophet I just believe him no you gotta have faith you got to believe that God sent him and that second part of that was what to reveal to me the mystery truce to get me out of here not just make me a good Christian brother Brown from 47 to 63 that's what he was doing he was hammering be a good Christian get better get back to the word of God get back get these virtues working in your life because when did he preach this remember he preached that you perfect man when just a second 1962. this is before the seals broke so in other words you got to have these virtues before you the seals break if brother Branham needed these virtues before that then you and I obviously are going to have to have the same thing that's why they're so important but why they're so ill-taught you don't hear many people preaching on them you know why because they can't live it and they don't think it's important I had one preacher say one time that well that's not very important I thought okay well just throw the throw the throw the book of Peter out second whatever it is second Peter one we're gonna start throwing things out if that's not important let's throw this out that's not important let's throw that out I thought we supposed to I thought we supposed to be living what is already in there not trying to throw stuff out or or skip over and read something different virtue anyone knows that the word virtue means seeing it must have you must have it we if virtue went out of him to heal the woman that was sick he's expecting the same virtue in his church same virtue in his church because he was our example and if he had virtue to give to the people he expects us to have virtue to give to the people and what is virtue virtue is strength or power I want you to read we read this quote the other day but I want you to read it in that big bold letters down there brother Brown said we got to have virtue we got to have virtue we've got to have virtue and after you have virtue you must after you have faith you must have virtue have virtue for the whole world wow have virtue for the whole world do you know the only thing holding this world together is me and you the wrath of God is about that far above us when we leave this place Katie Bar the Door if you're not from the south you won't understand what I just said but it's an old saying that uh Katie you better borrow the door because here comes the calvary all right then he talks about preaching the sermon we'll get to this right here and then we'll stop about 20 years ago when Reverend Mr Lilly Lilly the pastor took it from a text where Jesus said consider the Lily how they neither tall or spin yet I say to you Solomon in all his glory is not arrayed like one look at the Lily comes from way down in the muck we come from way down in the muck and every minute of the day it has to be drawing from the Earth see what does it do with this virtue that it draws it gives it out it makes a beautiful sight for the admirer it opens itself for honey for the bee to come and get his part don't complain it's just got it to give out wow what if the bee come in there insufficient finds us we're laughing we're being beekeepers we laugh about you know we see flowers out in the in the yard and the garden and stuff and the bees are just going at it well some of these flowers that we put on graves are plastic and we're you know thinking like a bee we're gonna fly to this thing and it's open it looks like it's got pollen on it we go this ain't soft this ain't gonna ain't got nothing in it that's what he's saying there was no pollen to get insufficient funds what fake yeah fake that Little Beaver scratch his hand and say what kind of Lilly is that or what kind of flower is that never have they ever made honey out of a plastic flower hello somebody I'm talking about us I put on a show got your perfect man brother Brown said I see I said then the first thing you know that somebody loves to smell the odor he's continued on this story he ain't selfish he's got older all those plants that we see that the bees go to they don't open up and say oh here comes a bee no they open up and they just keep making they just keep making pollen keep making pollen and the bee just keeps taking it keeps making honey and a lot of y'all are enjoying that he's got older before he can give out odor he has to have it before he can give out honey he has to have it before he can give up Beauty he has to have it before you can give out virtue you have to have it so add to your faith virtue amen understand now watch what he said he just stopped right here everybody wake up just for a minute get off your phone or whatever you're doing back there you can't look at me and looking down the floor before you can give out virtue you have to have it touch not physical see he reversed back to the woman that touched His Garment she didn't touch him physically but she pulled out of him what she needed pulled she pulled out so let's look and see what the word pull means just for a second we'll close it in just a second the word pull to exert Force upon so as to cause or tend to cause motion toward the force boy think spiritual with me please for just a few minutes that is so profound God is pulling us to his power God is pulling us to his word he's pulling us to have virtue watch to draw apart to rander to tear to perform or carry out now this is one I want to look at right here to draw the supporter attention of to attract brother Branham what is the attraction on the mountain what are you looking for what are you looking at are you looking just to sit here and die get a gold star for being a message believer for 50 years you want a pen no I want to get out of here I want to get old ER they're all ready they ain't pretty but to attract what have you been attracted to the whole time you've been in this message and you just been attracted and got Blinded By the Light of William Branham put it all on him I hope not because watch this just real quick and then we'll close right here this is my thought he's talking about pulling it out of it now the remember water we're the third pull the three pulls for those of you that are new I think everybody here is a Believers so they know what I say it when I mean third pull brother Ryan was given a vision and he was told that different pulls what's a pull you pull he's pulling something have you ever tried to push a rope it will not go where you want it to go but if you pull it it will you pull that rope it'll come right here you try to push that rope into that hole it'll go like this and that's just the way me and you are if we decide we're going to push this thing pull number one was what the saying he'd take people's hand and you see the bumps and then when the bumps would go away you were healed hit pronounce you heal all right the second one was discernment and I wrote myself a note to remember to talk about this but what did discernment do it pulled out what was in your heart is that right woman comes up to the platform he said woman I don't know you you like a fine woman maybe he will say your spirit is welcome so you must be a Christian what's she doing he's pulling out information he feels the poor from her because sometimes he didn't he said hey you need to get saved not too long ago I was wrote one it was a brother come up to that he said uh brother Brown said oh I see you want to be saved he said you need to quit smoking first that man probably went I didn't know that no he didn't I mean he didn't say it that bold he just said hey I see that you're here and I see you're looking for for salvation he said but you smoke cigarettes he said you need to quit he said you need to pray to get that smoking demon off of you and so even we just went ahead and prayed for him but look so all that discernment was what he pulled out what was inside those people and they pulled from him because he said it's not me he said the Angels standing between me and you right now or he's no more than two feet away that Pillar of Fire that discernment pulled out what was inside of him and what was inside of the people so to me that's what we're under you say now we're third poor people listen third pull is the opening of The Seven Seals if not the word of God's Discerning you right the word of God is what's doing the Discerning I mean it's like brother Dale said you don't have much discernment when people people look at you kind of angry and then look down and look away they can't look in the face but what's it doing you've come under listen you've come under the anointing of the Holy Ghost you come under the anointing of God himself not a second person or a third person you not come under the anointing of the message of the hour either well that made you quiet you come under the anointing of the Holy Ghost which is going to lead you to the message of the hour and give you all truth yes but we're under the discernment stage now we're going to you're going what did I tell you what I tell you beginning of the year let it out listen you either gonna let it out or God's gonna pull it out one of the two so we come under the second pole which is white deserman and then the third pull was what something he said no one can imitate this remember they imitated the first one they imitated the second one he said carnal impersonations everywhere he said but that third pool was what that was the opening of those seals that's where no man had ever been before that's when the son of man Ministry began in brother Brown's life believe it if you want to if you don't say man it means you don't believe it against daddy does because he's been preaching he's back there saying amen now we talked about Jesus for a minute let me get to something right here and then we'll close musicians come on talk about Peter and John they came to the gate beautiful and what was going on in their life is they were taught by the word of God they were taught all those years by the word of God you're gonna play in Maryland aren't you good job thank you that's good that you're about to let him do that you come up here and play something else there's nothing else to play okay well Ryan you play the bass not yet you've been practicing haven't you now's a good time to practice what are you laughing about you go play but look virtue himself and they walked with him and brother John they didn't understand and they probably looked at us like some people look at you and go what's he talking about because always they're going what are you talking about he talks to us in Parables what's going on here but I promise you we're not Holy Ghost because remember God said Jesus said hold on you may not understand go to Jerusalem and wait to you and dude with power from old high dunamis you're gonna understand what I've been telling you and then what you're going to do you're gonna be the one that's gonna preach it to the other people because out of that one man came 120 little jesuses and those 120 little Jesus's birth 3 000 on this day of Pentecost and there's no telling where they went the disciples went all over the world what preaching him preaching Jesus Christ that's what we need to get to preach Jesus Christ first because Peter looked at him fast his eyes on him and said look on us wasn't in a prayer line didn't have to go pray up didn't have to call the pastor look at us Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have give eye to thee in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk listen rise up and walk and took him by the hand and guess what immediately his feet and ankles receive what strength that's where that strength come from Peter and John The Virtue that they have they let it out and here it come and it hit that man right where he needed to hit that sister right where she needed it it hit all those brothers and sisters all the ones in the prayer line that virtue hit them right where they needed it brother Brown said you need salvation you need healing you got you know you got cancer you you got a broken up home you he was bringing he was pulling it out of him saying hey this is what's wrong with you that's what he's doing now we don't have to be in a prayer line tell us what's wrong with us today is Discerning by the thoughts and intents of the heart is Discerning from what the pulpit and you praying to God we didn't get to we'll get to the to the seals because there's a there's a power that was released in those first three Church ages there was two Powers there was one power of the devil and one power of God and those same powers are here today they've not left they're right here all right and we've got to what defeat that white horse so that by the time we get to Revelations 19 brother Kylie we can be on a wild horse ourselves but we'll be on the right one we won't be on the wrong one because there was a white horse went out the Conquering to conquer conquering into conquer that was the devil on a white horse deceiving me and you yes but all in Revelation is 19 I'll get to it this afternoon maybe that when it says in Revelations 19 that the wife has made herself ready she gets on a white horse and she's what she's right there with him the whole time listen

something that you can't get yourself out of I just read you the Bible they didn't do what the prophet said the king didn't do what the prophet said he thought oh well I'll just handle it on myself on my own well you see what he got the kingdom was totally pulled out of his hands there was no there was no way he was going to have his descendants though Jonathan and the different ones were wonderful wonderful but they all got killed because there was not going to be a king out of there God appointed David make David King then the people accepted him and then his line was Solomon and the different ones that became Kings right getting the right line humble yourself before God don't be haughty don't be heady and high-minded the Bible says Lover's a pleasure more than lovers of God don't think we can't be corrected don't think we can't come to a place that we need don't need Grace you're gonna need Grace till the day your body changes you are going to need not just Grace you're going to need

foolish let's don't believe ourselves to be above [Music] our maker that's what I can't understand about Satan he's looking at the guy that created him thinking he'd be better than that person that created him I just but he's deceived that's a deception that's a deception in this church age now is that Satan is now the God of this evil age and people are worshiping him and not even knowing that they're worshiping the devil got to name their call but they're dead Wow Let's bow our heads dear Lord thank you for the day that you give us Lord I pray you should be with us as we go eat a natural meal that I pray Lord that the spiritual meal we had today Lord will be sufficient for the people father and I pray that you should be with us Lord as we come back together be with the ones on the highways the ones that are sick that you'll bless them and be with them in Jesus name amen you're dismissed pass me
