[15:04] in flesh that's a good job that was good
[15:07] thank you
[15:08] good job I told I never heard her same
[15:11] thing before so that she she sang one
[15:14] time when we were going I think so thank
[15:17] you that was a blessing
[15:18] I wish Regina shout like that when I
[15:20] preach but that's okay sly brother Joe
[15:28] Greene said brother Joe Greene said his
[15:30] congregation they watched a video of him
[15:32] in Jamaican and they said well Joseph
[15:36] why don't you preach like that at home
[15:38] he said if you pull like they did I'll
[15:40] preach this like that so I guess if I
[15:43] preach as good as you're saying I'll get
[15:45] it from I'll get them we're gaining I
[15:48] guess hey hey I'm working on it I'm
[15:50] working on it
[15:51] hey you okay over there you okay all the
[15:55] cameras are on you we're good to be in
[15:59] the house with Lord it's just we enjoy
[16:02] singing we really do it's a good singing
[16:05] you know what it comes from the heart
[16:06] that's what I like more than anything is
[16:09] that it comes to my heart and we're the
[16:11] only people as we just talked about in
[16:12] Bible in Sunday school this morning
[16:14] we're the only people that really know
[16:16] where we come from what we're doing here
[16:17] where we're going we're the only people
[16:20] no one has ever understood that sure
[16:23] everybody has had faith and they've
[16:25] believed that God was somewhere and that
[16:30] somehow we're gonna go to heaven no no
[16:33] we had a prophet come and tell us he
[16:36] give us the whole journey of man from
[16:38] the mind of God all the way to the
[16:39] future home so what do we got to fear
[16:42] where's the fear at hey man this should
[16:44] be no fear but good to be in the house
[16:46] of the Lord remember next weekend
[16:48] brother Bob myself will be in Mobile
[16:50] Alabama for the weekend so just remember
[16:52] us and then dad T&M we're going to take
[16:56] a little vacation time and they're going
[16:57] to go out
[16:57] last for a little bit so Lord bless them
[17:00] and also remember put on your calendar
[17:02] October 27th will be our Fall Festival
[17:05] which that'll be a month or so from now
[17:08] but just like this year it'll be just a
[17:10] few weeks or a few days actually this
[17:13] year has just flown by here we already
[17:16] in September that's the time when when
[17:20] we come up to this is the this is the
[17:24] Jewish ending of their civil calendar
[17:27] right in here so so we're we're now of
[17:31] course we don't worry about that but
[17:32] still we watch things and you look and
[17:33] see what's going on because brother Bram
[17:35] always said watch Israel so maybe
[17:37] something will come up out of this month
[17:40] plus this month is heading toward
[17:42] harvest time I like harvest time I like
[17:45] harvest time I like the plant and that's
[17:48] okay but I like the harvest time because
[17:50] that's what we're going to be doing
[17:51] God's gonna harvest us out of this earth
[17:53] one day and we're gonna get out of here
[17:55] amen so good to be in the house with
[17:57] Lord few got your Bibles let's turn back
[17:58] now to revelation 6 verse 7 and read the
[18:03] fourth seal again we were talking in the
[18:07] Bible study last night it's really it's
[18:12] really good that their brother Dale is
[18:14] where he's at because on this fourth
[18:17] seal as we've always said that somebody
[18:21] has to come to adoption somebody has
[18:23] come to a completion somebody has come
[18:25] to the stature of a perfect man I I was
[18:28] hoping somebody would say something this
[18:30] morning or later on that you know that
[18:33] doesn't say the stature of a man once
[18:36] brother Dale preaching don't be you
[18:37] therefore perfect so that's the stature
[18:40] of a perfect man the only way you gonna
[18:42] be perfect is to have these virtues so
[18:45] it's just really simple that we must
[18:48] have these they're required and if
[18:50] there's a requirement then there has to
[18:52] be a way to get there and someone will
[18:55] because God saw it God knew it he saw
[18:57] somebody had already had already come to
[18:59] it before the foundation of the world
[19:01] he's just waiting on us to come to that
[19:04] place so let's bow our heads just for a
[19:06] few minutes and truly remember Cletus
[19:09] Cletus sounded a little worried about
[19:11] brother John so let's just really
[19:12] remember him he's like said he's about
[19:15] 95 and she said it was really bad she
[19:18] needed Tony to get home so maybe Lord
[19:20] had already spoke to him or something
[19:21] because he was already gone before I got
[19:24] out there so let's bow our heads there
[19:26] Hanley Father we pray Lord it should be
[19:27] with us today be the active participant
[19:30] in this service Lord be the speaker be
[19:32] the hero be the revealer most of all
[19:35] Lord just open your arms and just love
[19:37] us you sent your word Lord to love us
[19:40] and Lord now we're going to speak to you
[19:42] out of that love letter back to you
[19:45] father because you love to hear you word
[19:47] the Prophet said so we're going to speak
[19:49] your word today Lord and I pray that it
[19:51] be you that does the speaking lord I
[19:53] pray that you'd be with John Smallwood
[19:55] Lord whatever the situation is that Lord
[19:59] is not too big for you and Lord that
[20:01] you've already intervened Lord that
[20:03] you'll help our brethren Lord in a time
[20:05] of trouble father we all going to come
[20:08] to a place maybe if the time keeps going
[20:10] on that we're going to need you in that
[20:11] time of trouble and I pray Lord that
[20:13] there'll be a group of people that will
[20:14] pray just as we're praying now that we
[20:17] that will change the situation Lord
[20:20] that'll take something that's awful and
[20:22] turn it into something Lord to be a a
[20:25] witness or to be something Lord that we
[20:27] can testify about it father we pray that
[20:30] should be with the ones that are sick
[20:32] that are not here that you touch them
[20:33] father bless them distressed or small
[20:36] whether they're with a fever and all
[20:37] those things and the ones that are not
[20:39] here the ones that are traveling brother
[20:41] Joe sister Rachel and them to be with
[20:42] him as they travel back today father
[20:44] fellowship and down brother
[20:45] Yancy's Lauren president should be with
[20:48] each one take care of us lead us and
[20:49] guide us by your Holy Spirit and the
[20:51] name of Jesus Christ we ask these things
[20:53] amen
[20:54] and when he had opened the fourth seal I
[20:57] heard the voice of the fourth beast and
[20:59] who's the fourth beast eagle come and
[21:02] see and I looked and behold a pale horse
[21:04] and his name that sat on him was death
[21:06] and hell followed with him and power was
[21:09] given unto them over the fourth part of
[21:11] the earth to kill with the sword and
[21:13] with hunger and with death and with the
[21:17] beasts of the earth you may be seated in
[21:18] the Lord at his blessing to the reading
[21:19] of the word now when it won't need a
[21:22] chart till probably next Sunday
[21:23] but we were talking now and if you'll
[21:28] notice kind of when we get into every
[21:32] when when when all but all of our minds
[21:36] get to thinking about the same thing God
[21:38] comes in and ever it seems like
[21:39] everything we think about is on that
[21:43] subject
[21:43] have you ever noticed that because
[21:46] remember brother Brown said we've got to
[21:47] get into what the tune with the
[21:48] conductor then people that are playing
[21:51] in flutes and harps and all those things
[21:53] they have all different strings they
[21:54] have all different things they have to
[21:56] do but once they get into the groove and
[21:58] that conductor begins to conduct they
[22:01] just fall right in and it becomes a
[22:03] wonderful symphony even though they're
[22:05] all different instruments but it makes
[22:08] one great concert and that's exactly
[22:10] what I think we're coming to you now
[22:11] we're coming to the last concert we're
[22:13] coming to the last play the last thing
[22:15] that's going to happen and I'll read it
[22:17] to you in just a few minutes we're
[22:18] brother Branham was talking about the
[22:21] last thing that strikes this earth
[22:22] before we go home and spiritual death
[22:26] all right that's kind of what we're
[22:27] going to be speaking on again spiritual
[22:30] death part to natural death is not bad
[22:34] spiritual death is really bad they meant
[22:38] so we're going to read Joel again and
[22:39] kind of background just for a minute and
[22:41] then bring something to you probably not
[22:44] this coming Sunday obviously but the
[22:46] next Sunday we'll speak a little bit on
[22:47] the resurrection
[22:49] make kind of hit a few things this
[22:51] afternoon but to me that's that's the
[22:57] next thing before we we can't leave here
[23:00] without a resurrection so there's got to
[23:03] be a calling of the dead out of the
[23:05] ground like we were talking about this
[23:08] morning now and those people are not
[23:10] going to come in here and they're not
[23:11] gonna have to wipe the dust off of their
[23:13] body they're not gonna have to dig their
[23:16] way out of a grave no no they're going
[23:19] to come from that other dimension
[23:20] they're gonna walk into this dimension
[23:22] they're gonna pick up that body in that
[23:24] grave pop right back just like Jesus
[23:27] went through the wall pop right back up
[23:28] and then enter in with us and have no
[23:31] problem with that
[23:32] no fear no anything and nothing like
[23:34] that so we're not going to be a we're
[23:36] not going to have to
[23:37] to a graveside and we're not going to
[23:38] drive by and see red mountain of dirt up
[23:42] on know this is a secret catching away
[23:44] this is this is the world Jesus said the
[23:47] world will see me no more but you'll see
[23:49] me so what happens is is when we enter
[23:52] in and begin we get born again and we
[23:54] enter into what God's mind is thinking
[23:57] then we see these things more clear than
[24:00] maybe somebody else because if you were
[24:03] to ask maybe someone in a denominational
[24:08] Church if say what do you think about
[24:10] the resurrection well you gonna get
[24:12] about 50 different ideas what's going to
[24:15] happen but brother Branham told us
[24:18] what's going to happen even God took him
[24:20] into the sixth dimension to show him
[24:22] that the people were alive more live
[24:24] there than they are here and that he had
[24:26] to come back here and that they're going
[24:28] to come back here because the Bible
[24:30] always said that but really we didn't
[24:31] understand that until the Prophet came
[24:33] it's like I was saying this morning I I
[24:35] really like to use I'm a preach on
[24:37] Nellie's or again in the future but
[24:41] remember Eliezer did not write the love
[24:44] letter
[24:46] he told Rebecca about Isaac so much till
[24:53] when Rebecca got off the camel that was
[24:56] probably fifty people or a hundred
[24:57] people in the field working but Eleazar
[25:00] had told her so much about Isaac that
[25:04] when she lid off that camel the Bible
[25:06] says she ran and she didn't have to go
[25:09] are you are you are know she ran right
[25:12] to the guy but now remember Eliezer
[25:15] didn't run with her he was finished with
[25:20] his work just like Mordechai was
[25:24] finished with his work there's there's
[25:26] always a person there that has a word
[25:28] brother Branham had a work to do but
[25:30] he's not here he's our Eliezer that told
[25:33] us about our Isaac so he didn't write
[25:37] the love letter
[25:39] God wrote the love letter before the
[25:41] foundation of the world the prophet of
[25:43] God didn't change the love letter the
[25:45] prophet of God just told us what the
[25:47] love letter said he told us the in
[25:50] between
[25:50] and and you know he at least I probably
[25:53] said now this Isaac
[25:54] he probably described him right to a tea
[25:57] because you know what because Ellie is
[26:00] our new Isaac you just just didn't pull
[26:05] somebody off that says what well I don't
[26:08] know if we know Isaac or not I really
[26:10] wouldn't know him if I met him no
[26:12] Eliezer was right there with him the
[26:14] whole time he was commissioned actually
[26:17] by Abraham it was in Abraham house
[26:20] remember he come in and Eliezer so in
[26:22] other words he grew up and he was
[26:24] studied he was mature like we were
[26:26] talking about last night God doesn't
[26:28] start a church as a baby he starts some
[26:31] estimate or people all right because you
[26:34] know what I need to mature somebody to
[26:36] help me you need to mature somebody to
[26:39] help you and then what Jesus say is that
[26:42] if you know if we're both blind with
[26:44] what found a niche but if I got somebody
[26:47] that's got some light and I follow them
[26:49] then I know the path when he takes me
[26:52] down that path I go down that path with
[26:54] him that's why we need a God with skin
[26:57] on it when either God was skin on it to
[27:00] lead us and to talk to us and to speak
[27:02] to us and to take Donnie faught Bush
[27:04] this situation where william branham
[27:07] never met donnie for bush
[27:09] but samuel day old met Donnie for Bush
[27:11] in knows Donnie for Bush and he can help
[27:12] Donnie for Bush proved the message of
[27:15] the hour but still he didn't know him
[27:18] but here we are here today for each one
[27:22] of us I was thinking about that last
[27:24] night in a Bible study we all need help
[27:26] all of us needs help
[27:28] there's no great ones among us there's
[27:30] no big eyes and little use we all need
[27:32] help we all get a little crumb sometimes
[27:35] we get a whole pie but sometimes we get
[27:38] just a crumb but you know a crumb from
[27:41] the pie of God is good enough for me
[27:43] remember what the syrophoenician woman
[27:44] said she said just give me the crumb you
[27:48] can call me a dog you can call me what
[27:50] everyone called me I just want a crumb
[27:52] off from under your table
[27:54] hey man and that's being you so we're
[27:56] gonna get a crumb today maybe or maybe
[27:58] you'll get a pile will say be glad you
[28:00] children of Zion of resourcing the Lord
[28:02] your God for you have given you the form
[28:03] of rain
[28:04] currently and he will call us to come
[28:06] down for you the rain the former rain
[28:07] and the latter rain in the first month
[28:09] and the floor shall be full of wheat and
[28:12] the fat shall overflow with wine and oil
[28:14] and I will restore to you the years that
[28:16] the locust has eaten the cankerworm the
[28:18] caterpillar DePalma worm my great army
[28:21] which I sent among you and ye shall eat
[28:23] him plenty so in other words when he
[28:26] restores what happened was that plant
[28:29] was a great plant and then Satan through
[28:34] false doctrine eat that thing down to a
[28:37] stump well you can't eat up you can't
[28:40] eat a stump you can't eat a root well
[28:44] yeah but you can but when when you can
[28:46] but you take a you take a corn plant and
[28:48] you take a bug and you eat it down to
[28:50] where there's nothing but this don't you
[28:52] gonna eat that
[28:53] no God said I'm going to restore bite
[28:56] the whole plant because you shall eat in
[28:58] plenty in other words he's gonna have
[29:01] brother John a whole field a whole field
[29:04] of corn for us to eat all right hey man

[29:15] see you give all them people sugar
[29:16] between services and they all gonna fall
[29:18] asleep on me maybe you need to start
[29:22] bringing leeks and garlic mmm yeah
[29:25] cucumbers and lisas shaking his head
[29:28] maybe some cayenne peppers before the
[29:31] service I see mark over here every once
[29:34] in while I know what he's doing he's got
[29:35] that peppermint right have you ever had
[29:39] a shot of pure peppermint before you'll
[29:41] shout like Regina
[29:44] you get a little shot of peppermint and
[29:46] put it on your buddy you'll be away for
[29:48] a while but I told Ryan I said you fed
[29:50] these people sugar and I said they all

[29:53] on me today
[29:54] and you shall eat him plenty and be
[29:57] satisfied and praise the name of the
[29:59] Lord your God that has dealt wondrously
[30:01] with you and my people shall never be
[30:04] ashamed I love that because we come to
[30:07] that fourth seal and to me this wraps up
[30:10] everything that we're going to go
[30:12] through that while you and I are alive
[30:14] as a Christian we're gonna see this
[30:16] right here
[30:18] we know that's been eat now we've come
[30:21] through the back part of the years of
[30:23] when that that bug eat all that away but
[30:26] I will restore a man so we're living
[30:30] under that I will restore to you the
[30:35] years that the locust has eaten the cake
[30:38] worm caterpillar pummel worm so he has
[30:40] promised he's going to bring that plant
[30:43] back and we're going to eat in plenty
[30:45] not just nibble no we get the full meal
[30:50] seven course meal not just because
[30:54] remember down through the other ages you
[30:56] know what they had to take crumbs there
[30:59] to take pieces you and I get the whole
[31:02] lamb we have to eat the whole lamb
[31:05] because remember they had to eat the
[31:07] whole lamb before they left Egypt hey
[31:10] man there was a lamb in every house they
[31:13] had to eat the whole lamb before they
[31:15] walked out that door and made their
[31:17] journey to Canaan land there man so
[31:20] let's go to the next one now to the to
[31:23] the quote here where we we were talking
[31:25] about this this morning I mean yesterday
[31:26] in the Bible study I hope you understand
[31:30] this I don't want to be sacrilegious
[31:32] about this and brother Dale was using it
[31:33] yesterday - but if we compartmentalize
[31:35] or put something in a box I'm just
[31:37] reading you what brother Baron said he
[31:40] said that they were set this box up here
[31:43] to resent represent that if God sends a
[31:46] certain spirit among them that's the
[31:48] only thing they can work by Martin
[31:52] Luther let's just take this John Wesley
[31:54] had a Bible
[31:56] because tinsdale and all them wrote the
[31:58] Bible while he was alive so he had a
[32:00] physical Bible but he didn't live the
[32:04] whole Bible he did not he didn't live
[32:08] the whole Bible so the only thing he
[32:10] could work by was is God said I will
[32:14] restore to you Luther the just shall
[32:18] live by faith
[32:18] I'll restore to you Wesley start living
[32:22] a better life start living a Christian
[32:25] life where people can see that you have
[32:28] what separated from that old way of
[32:30] doing things but see it's it's the
[32:34] spirit that works among them now will
[32:35] prove to you by the history of the
[32:37] church by the opening of the seals so
[32:39] the opening of the seals to me that
[32:41] compartmentalizes all that shows you
[32:43] what each age is there was an overlap
[32:46] watch exactly how the church responded
[32:49] to the anointing and they couldn't do
[32:52] nothing else so you and I we can't do
[32:55] anything else but have the full word
[32:58] restored in this time in this day in
[33:00] this hour and in this church age because
[33:02] there's no other Church age so my acid
[33:04] well why is that important look there's
[33:06] no every church age there was a box
[33:08] sitting beside one and then it will go
[33:10] to the next one then it will go to the
[33:12] next one well folks there's not another
[33:14] one
[33:15] there's no 80 Church ages there's no
[33:18] other messenger to bring us another
[33:19] something else our box is going to get
[33:26] disappear and well you know what if
[33:30] you're in the box if Wesley's people
[33:32] were in the box they're in the ground
[33:36] waiting on you but they're going to
[33:37] heaven by what God told them in the Box
[33:39] you and I are going to take a body
[33:41] change because that's what the box tells
[33:44] us that's the spirit of the age the
[33:46] spirit of the time and you and I lie
[33:49] brother Dale said we must have these
[33:53] virtues because the prophet of God said
[33:55] you can't you can't have a resurrection
[33:59] and be a novice right we've had had
[34:06] knowledge we've had fifty years ahead
[34:07] knowledge
[34:09] like we were talking about last night
[34:12] the disciples you know Peter on the day
[34:20] that before Jesus was crucified and what
[34:22] did he do he got real angry and cut a
[34:26] man's ear off now that ain't brotherly
[34:28] kindness that's the same guy that
[34:30] preached us brotherly kindness that
[34:32] wasn't brotherly kindness right but when
[34:36] God birthed him into the family of God
[34:39] on the day of Pentecost Peter turns
[34:42] around and says I'll never do that again
[34:45] now I got to keep myself under control
[34:48] so I can teach you never heard of
[34:50] another situation where there was an ear
[34:53] cut off or or anything like that so
[34:55] that's what God had to do same way with
[34:57] you and I I was telling somebody
[34:59] yesterday God can we're looking for the
[35:02] last seed you know everybody's looking
[35:04] for the last seed to come in well why
[35:06] are we looking for him to come in why
[35:10] aren't we looking for him to come in
[35:11] they may be sitting in this building
[35:13] today 20 years in the message and just
[35:16] be sanctified and all of a sudden God
[35:18] birth what they have heard for twenty
[35:21] years and make them a mature adult so
[35:24] what I believe in going out there and
[35:30] getting lost souls don't get me wrong I
[35:33] believe that but that last soul has got
[35:36] to come to a maturity in this age so it
[35:39] can't be somebody that you brought in
[35:41] off the street and in two weeks later
[35:42] he's a manifested son of God that can't
[35:44] happen you say oh yeah anything with God
[35:47] yes anything with God's possible but
[35:49] it's highly unlikely that's going to
[35:51] happen amen
[35:53] but what about somebody sitting here
[35:54] that aren't even anywhere in the world
[35:56] that last person sitting in a message
[35:59] church for twenty years and finally some
[36:01] good Holy Ghost preacher gets up and
[36:03] preaches the new birth the right way and
[36:07] it quickens everything that they heard
[36:10] for twenty years and made them realize
[36:14] they were what in a state of
[36:16] sanctification see I like to think of it
[36:20] better that way because as soon as that
[36:21] person gets born again he
[36:22] gonna be just like Peter he's gonna be
[36:25] boom he's gonna be right up there to
[36:27] where he has these virtues working
[36:28] because he's been there he's been in the
[36:30] process that's just my you know what I
[36:32] don't I don't have a quote for that but
[36:35] I just think that's the way it would be
[36:36] is that God the last seed this probably
[36:39] still is already sitting here
[36:41] he's already sitting some he or she's
[36:43] sitting in a church listening to the
[36:45] Word of God and one day God is gonna
[36:46] quicken that and then we're all gonna go
[36:48] home but you know what we can't wait on
[36:50] that we got to go we got F what progress
[36:56] you said all the way to that last seed
[36:59] or wait till brother Branham gets back
[37:01] well you'll be here when the tribulation
[37:03] happens so anyway so does everybody
[37:08] understand that the Spirit is going to
[37:11] work by what God said the word was going
[37:14] to be for that hour that's why I believe
[37:17] the church ages had to be preached
[37:18] before the seals were preached to line
[37:21] everything up and get all the
[37:23] characteristics of the ages Linda get
[37:26] the preachers lined up or the prophets
[37:29] that come into those church ages and
[37:31] then he brought the seals because the
[37:33] seals then we can take just like what
[37:35] we've been doing take the
[37:36] characteristics of the seal
[37:38] I mean of the church ages and put them
[37:39] right with the seals hey man so he had
[37:42] to bring the church ages first before he
[37:44] could bring the seals all right so
[37:46] everybody all right with that say man
[37:47] all right so here we go now number two
[37:50] on the fifth seal we've been reading
[37:52] these I'm just gonna do it the
[37:53] background let's just go over this now
[37:57] we know that the last beast was what an
[37:59] eagle all right
[38:01] the fourth living beast was an eagle now
[38:03] we just studied the ages study the
[38:05] scripture is an eagle and in the Bible
[38:07] the last age was an eagle age and God
[38:10] likens the Eagles to its prophets the
[38:13] last days the Eagle a is a revealer of
[38:16] the true word now we know that that
[38:20] broke with the prophet coming on the
[38:22] scene and bringing everything together
[38:24] thereby alright with that the Prophet
[38:27] Kant had to come on the scene to put
[38:29] everything together but now remember
[38:31] he's not the only Eagle
[38:34] man
[38:36] he's not the only Eagle look at number
[38:39] three now it was not mentioned of the
[38:42] other time of this rider now let's
[38:44] mention that he's called death under the
[38:46] revelation of the line now I want to
[38:48] read anyway
[38:49] not under the revelation of the line age
[38:51] of the first age the early age this
[38:54] wasn't revealed the next stage was the
[38:56] ox which was the Dark Age the middle age
[38:58] it wasn't revealed as it wasn't that's
[39:00] what it was
[39:01] nor the man-like beasts of wisdom
[39:04] representing the Reformers Lutheran
[39:06] Wesley and so forth it wasn't revealed
[39:08] but in the eagle lays the last sage the
[39:11] prophetic age where there is to rise
[39:13] prophetic utterance the Prophet was the
[39:18] first one to partake of that revelation
[39:21] no doubt we would be lost without him
[39:26] not lost is in your soul we'd be lost as
[39:29] far as the word goes amen because he
[39:31] didn't say my soul Jesus Christ saved my
[39:33] soul and then brother Branham brought
[39:35] the word to what turn us back to Christ
[39:37] all right so that's what he done he
[39:40] turned us back to Christ but he didn't
[39:41] turn us back to Christ under a line or
[39:44] an ox or a man it was under the eagle
[39:46] anointing our prophetic utterance you
[39:49] and I was thinking about this last night
[39:51] or yesterday the Bible study you take
[39:57] just what we talked about last night
[40:00] well join them they were they were there
[40:03] they they said he had a good time why
[40:05] cuz it was a lot of questions answered
[40:06] you get a lot of questions answered in
[40:08] the by in Bible study all right but you
[40:10] take that what we were talking about
[40:12] last night just to three different
[40:13] little doctrinal issues Paul would have
[40:18] Paul would have understood it but it
[40:20] would have took a little more background
[40:22] for Paul to really understood what we
[40:24] were talking about the Apostle Paul he
[40:27] wrote the word but he was what he was
[40:30] prophesying of a group of people to come
[40:33] same way with Luther and Wesley brother
[40:35] Graham said if Wesley what if Paul would
[40:37] come back what he'd be in jail tomorrow
[40:40] right if Wesley were to come back or
[40:43] Luther words to come back and sit down
[40:44] here and listen just a little while sure
[40:47] they would catch it but man it would
[40:48] their mind at first but to me and you
[40:51] it's become normal in common why because
[40:54] we have let's just put it this way we
[40:59] are no better than nobody else don't you
[41:01] ever think that if you think you're
[41:03] better than somebody else you got the
[41:04] wrong spirit but but wait a minute what
[41:08] gods say about you
[41:10] you're a prophetic people you have
[41:14] prophetic utterance you have a prophetic
[41:17] mind that's what's your box is Paul
[41:24] didn't have to do that this box this is
[41:26] your box this is the box that we are
[41:28] dealing under we are prophetic people
[41:33] with an eagle anointing that didn't
[41:35] leave with the prophet no it didn't
[41:38] leave with the Prophet it actually
[41:40] enhanced everything
[41:42] Amen just like Jesus when he was here he
[41:44] didn't say nobody when he was physically
[41:49] here he didn't save a person but he come
[41:52] back 50 days later and saved in 123,000
[41:55] now 30 million maybe a man he did more
[41:59] work when he was gone same way with the
[42:02] property God if the Prophet would have
[42:05] stayed around here they would have
[42:06] thought he was God and they would have
[42:07] done all these things and but God took
[42:09] him off so we could focus on Christ amen
[42:12] focus on Christ not doing away with
[42:15] brother branham without him folks we
[42:16] would not be oh my lord
[42:19] we'd be just like and I'll read it in a
[42:22] minute we'd be spiritually dead we'd be
[42:25] sitting in the church and we'd be
[42:26] spiritually dead but now you and I with
[42:29] prophetic utterance we can take all
[42:31] these things even excuse me Romans that
[42:34] were doing downstairs I've learned more
[42:36] in the first eight chapters of Romans
[42:38] and I've read it 50 hundred times what
[42:41] is 1500 a lot I've read it a hundred
[42:47] times and you just get more and you just
[42:50] get more and you just get more I see now
[42:53] that that what Paul was writing in
[42:55] Romans went into the Romans it was to me
[43:00] it was my this my book that's what Paul
[43:03] wrote to me but you know what it was it
[43:05] was good now you don't think you don't
[43:09] think God sir well now I'm just gonna
[43:10] write you know about twelve or fourteen
[43:13] chapters or Romans and just to fill the
[43:14] Bible up I'm gonna write that in there
[43:16] and maybe somebody will read it
[43:19] he wrote that specifically because he
[43:22] knew you'd need it when you got here he
[43:24] knew I would need it when I got here hey
[43:27] man that's why you need to make this
[43:28] thing personal to me the seals make this
[43:31] thing personal it brings a personal
[43:34] revelation to you not to the guy sitting
[43:36] beside you to you amen
[43:39] because remember it's a personal affair
[43:42] with God not 144,000 no individuals amen
[43:50] because look 144,000 they have a box to
[43:53] work in the two prophets are not to us
[43:57] right
[43:58] they're to 144,000 so they have an
[44:01] anointing that's coming after we leave
[44:04] and that's all there be able to deal
[44:07] with they're not gonna pull out 148,000
[44:10] they're gonna get 12,000 out of 12
[44:13] tribes and it's gonna be 144,000 people
[44:16] plus two saved and taken out of here
[44:19] amen
[44:20] so that's how precise God is with them
[44:24] but you and I he's not that he knows the
[44:26] number but you're not knowing he takes
[44:28] us as a nation okay so now it's looking
[44:31] to see what this spirit is doing this
[44:34] Antichrist spirit that has been made
[44:36] known while the seals are open is number
[44:40] number four now I want you to know this
[44:43] to four of them notice the are mark of
[44:46] four of the spiritual mathematics God is
[44:50] threes this is for he's in for here
[44:54] first Antichrist white cause anything
[44:58] that's against God is anti right so so
[45:01] the whole basis of Satan is as he's anti
[45:04] he's anti word he's anti God he's anti
[45:07] everything alright second false prophet
[45:11] red remember he comes up and they
[45:14] don't get goes from a saying to a deed
[45:16] to a doctrine all right
[45:18] vai Kirov hep third vai curve heaven and
[45:21] earth and purgatory black now fourth is
[45:24] the one world now fourth the Beast now
[45:27] what happens is Satan has incarnated a
[45:31] human being in this part Satan has
[45:35] incarnated a human being but I but
[45:38] before he can incarnate a human being
[45:40] God has the Incarnate a human being and
[45:44] then God in this fourth seal God has
[45:51] that's why this is so important this is
[45:54] not just a pretty picture I love the one
[45:59] Aaron I love the one that's got Christ
[46:02] standing in this because he's the only
[46:05] perfect man I've never lived on the
[46:07] earth but through him through him you
[46:11] and I are heirs and joint heirs when we
[46:16] come under the adoption like I tried to
[46:18] run it off few minutes ago and I
[46:19] couldn't get it but maybe we'll get it
[46:21] run off for you at home but about
[46:25] adoption because when he adopts you into
[46:27] the family can tada he can't kick you
[46:29] out and then so when he get when we're
[46:32] adopted into the family we received the
[46:34] spirit of adoption we are heirs and
[46:37] joint heirs when we gonna start
[46:38] believing that amen
[46:41] and I'll prove something to you just
[46:43] just right at the end of this if that's
[46:45] okay so now remember Satan being kicked
[46:49] out of heaven Satan being kicked out of
[46:52] heaven forth the Beast Pale Horse Satan
[46:55] being kicked out of heaven
[46:56] why is he kicked out of heaven because
[46:58] we're heading in that that we're going
[46:59] there we're going there and Satan is
[47:02] going to come here remember he's
[47:04] accusing who he's accusing Gentiles the
[47:08] bride he's accusing the bride right now
[47:12] but when we leave this earth when we
[47:15] come to perfection what's he going to
[47:18] say what's he going to say when the dead
[47:22] walk back in and we get a glorified body
[47:24] what Satan got to accuse you
[47:28] thought of that I want you to think of
[47:29] that where is the accuser of your
[47:33] brethren he's here now why because we're
[47:37] not in perfection yet we're in we're had
[47:39] were in the box of perfection right but
[47:45] when we come to a body change the prince
[47:48] of this world has come and has nothing
[47:51] in me remember when Jesus said jesus
[47:55] said he has nothing Satan is not even
[48:00] found yet he's not even near me why he
[48:04] was a perfect man
[48:05] so Satan being kicked out of heaven the
[48:08] reason he's been kicked out of heaven is
[48:10] that's what we're going he can't stand
[48:12] to be where we are so when we go to
[48:15] heaven he comes right here and does what
[48:18] he incarnate a beast he incarnate a
[48:22] human man called the Pope that has
[48:26] yielded itself just like you supposed to
[48:29] yield yourself to God he yields himself
[48:32] to that fault system listen thinking
[48:35] that he's right he's not gonna walk up
[48:38] and say well now I'm gonna I'm gonna
[48:40] kill everybody I say no he's gonna be
[48:42] what come in with flattery he's gonna
[48:46] come in with we're gonna bring the world
[48:48] together and you know what I got enough
[48:50] money I'll bail you out United States
[48:52] I'll just I'll just write you a check
[48:54] but you got to do some things for me
[48:57] yeah you got a speak for me you got they
[49:01] listen with God there's no strings
[49:03] attached with Satan there's all kind of
[49:05] strings
[49:05] it's like spaghetti everything's attack
[49:08] anything Satan does it's all attached
[49:10] hey you got to do this and I got to do
[49:12] that and I'm gonna do this and you're
[49:13] gonna do that God just says believe my
[49:15] word believe on me and you'll have
[49:18] eternal life no strings attached
[49:21] amen alright so first Antichrist second
[49:26] false prophet third biker of heaven and
[49:28] earth but fourth is the beast that's
[49:31] where all those powers come together and
[49:34] make one person this is one man that's
[49:39] gonna rule the world for a certain
[49:40] period of time
[49:41] and then for three and a half years
[49:44] remember he's going to make a covenant
[49:46] according to Daniel 70 weeks he makes a
[49:48] covenant for one for seven years or one
[49:51] week and in the midst of that week he's
[49:53] going to break that covenant you know
[49:55] what he's going to do he's going to walk
[49:56] in and tell Israel I am your God then
[50:03] all heck's gonna break loose
[50:04] cuz there's what's gonna say no I don't
[50:07] think you are you get out of my temple
[50:10] he says no this is my temple and then
[50:13] somebody's gonna match the button cuz
[50:14] remember brother Brown said the Vatican
[50:16] the what the atomic bomb was gonna go
[50:19] right down into the Vatican and blow it
[50:20] to smithereens
[50:21] who's gonna mash that button a Catholic
[50:26] I don't think so but anyway that's for
[50:30] them after we're gone that's just that's
[50:32] just little peripheral things that that
[50:35] we enjoy talking about but we're not
[50:36] gonna be here to see that
[50:37] but remember let's remember these three
[50:40] things because I want to make a point
[50:41] here
[50:41] I'll be very long we got communion today
[50:44] remember go the next one in this sealed
[50:50] death has to be destroyed a resurrection
[50:53] has to take place and a rapture takes
[50:56] place on this seal the next seal you see
[50:59] remember is in another dimension so as
[51:03] we go into another dimension Satan comes
[51:05] into this dimension sure he's already
[51:08] here but he's going to literally
[51:09] incarnate a man I don't think we
[51:12] understand that sure he's working in
[51:14] everything but he's gonna literally
[51:15] incarnate one man and that one man you
[51:19] know what he's gonna have signs he's
[51:21] gonna have wonders he's gonna Rock
[51:23] miracles the Bible says and the whole
[51:25] world is gonna fall at his feet what
[51:29] thinking he's the Savior in the world
[51:31] that's what they'll think they'll think
[51:33] well we finally got the man yeah they
[51:37] did
[51:37] they finally got the man but you and I
[51:40] though under the opening of these seals
[51:43] we know where he's at and what he's
[51:44] doing all the things that's happened and
[51:47] we know where that's coming from and we
[51:49] live look because we're gonna read some
[51:51] things like we did last week
[51:55] we're not talking about the people we're
[51:58] talking about the system the system
[52:01] they're under is dead
[52:02] and then the system they're under is
[52:05] dead not the people but you have to
[52:09] remember if you willingly attach
[52:12] yourself to the system you become part
[52:16] of that system okay and you die with it
[52:19] all right but you do have maybe maybe
[52:22] you do have hope at the wine-throwing I
[52:24] don't know but let's look just right
[52:26] here number five it's just a little more
[52:29] background then we'll then we'll get to
[52:30] her to our point now fully look now
[52:34] watch this is on the fourth seal notice
[52:38] fully Satan on his throne offered it to
[52:41] God offered it to our Lord here he is
[52:45] sitting here with this beastly heart in
[52:47] him now here is the person the beast the
[52:50] Incarnate devil he makes his appearing
[52:53] here on earth under the false pretense
[52:55] oh my goodness
[52:57] under the false pretense of the true
[52:59] word he associates himself with the word
[53:03] so he's not this gruesome horrible thing
[53:07] no he associates himself with the Word
[53:09] of God that's what he wants to be that's
[53:14] what he wants to be he wants to be
[53:15] associated but watch what but now look
[53:19] we have a promise let's read the
[53:20] national number six this is from the
[53:24] fourth seal now we had him coming last
[53:25] night with a great sword to kill we find
[53:27] out that he gets killed with the sword
[53:29] to the sword of the word so see we're no
[53:33] match for the devil but God's give us a
[53:35] word in this end time to defeat the
[53:39] devil with and then the sword of the
[53:42] word God's words sharp two-edged sword
[53:44] slays him puts him right down wait till
[53:48] them seven thunders under their voices
[53:50] in that group who really can take the
[53:53] word and hand it there poured that group
[53:58] in it where's that group my brothers and
[54:02] sisters I want to ask you that question
[54:03] there is a group
[54:07] and you gotta be alive you gotta be
[54:11] listening to the full Word of God you
[54:13] make your choice and hand it there it'll
[54:17] slice and cut and they can close the
[54:19] heavens they can shut this to that
[54:20] whatever they want to do you say well I
[54:22] thought about the two prophets folks I
[54:25] think we're gonna have a little bit of
[54:26] control on this side we're gonna have to
[54:30] to keep to destroy death we're gonna
[54:32] have to come to a place to where Adam
[54:37] had full control of nature you and I are
[54:39] gonna have full control of nature I just
[54:40] believe that he will be slayed by the
[54:43] word that proceeds from his mouth it's
[54:45] sharper than a two-edged sword they call
[54:47] for a hundred billion tons of Flyers
[54:48] daddy doesn't like this one if they
[54:50] hunted well they all said anything but
[54:54] flies please anything but flies okay
[54:56] whatever they say is gonna happen maybe
[54:59] it'll wake you up a little bit whatever
[55:00] you say is gonna happen because it's the
[55:02] Word of God coming from the mouth of God
[55:03] now that's coming from you though
[55:05] because watch watch his soul you say
[55:08] well that's all coming from God that's
[55:09] all coming from God what's his summation
[55:11] just like Paul Paul takes 20 verses but
[55:15] he'll take one verse in he'll surmise or
[55:17] he'll make a summation in one verse
[55:20] he'll make a summation in one verse of
[55:23] everything he's talking about what just
[55:24] right here you saw what's coming from
[55:25] the mouth of God that's coming from here
[55:27] it's coming from there it's his word but
[55:29] he always uses man to work it God could
[55:33] call for them flies in Egypt but he said
[55:35] Moses that's your job I'll just tell you
[55:38] what to do and you go do it he fully
[55:39] done that see he could have chose the
[55:42] son to call him he could have caused the
[55:43] moon to call him or the wind to call it
[55:45] but he said Moses that that he chooses
[55:49] men so true like we were told by this
[55:53] mother dealt in fivefold ministry I know
[55:58] we keep harping on that but man I tell
[56:00] you the Bible is clear for the
[56:01] perfecting of the Saints we got to
[56:03] listen to a fivefold ministry all right
[56:06] and you know what I was thinking about
[56:10] this the other day
[56:16] that guy's taking cannabis oil or
[56:18] something I never I never heard that
[56:22] going off of you
[56:24] he's but the Word of God has to come
[56:28] through me and you it's just that way
[56:31] just like he said right there
[56:33] he chose Moses he chose David he chose
[56:37] but now he's chose a bride to speak
[56:41] through this is not a one man message
[56:44] anymore
[56:45] it was brother Branham brought the
[56:48] message when he brought the message he
[56:50] was just like I said he's like a pipe
[56:52] god just poured it down that pipe and it
[56:55] came right out of his mouth and I really
[56:59] don't care if his dates are wrong I
[57:01] don't care for his mama was a hundred
[57:04] and fifty when he had her had him I
[57:06] really don't care don't bring me that
[57:09] stuff amen
[57:12] I can read what that love letter says
[57:18] I'm sure Ellie Azar's thing about this
[57:21] last night I'm sure Eliezer had his
[57:23] problems he wasn't perfect but he had a
[57:26] commission and when that commission was
[57:29] fulfilled guess what you'll hear rallies
[57:31] are no more
[57:33] he got Isaac and Rebekah together he'd
[57:36] done his job and then he left the scene
[57:39] amen Moses got him up to the promised
[57:42] land left to sing Joshua took him over
[57:47] amen
[57:48] as it was a promise son not Eleazar
[57:53] Isaac was the promised son and Rebekah
[57:56] was the promised woman because look wall
[57:57] came through that amen
[57:59] so you and I have been chosen not by man
[58:02] you and I have been chosen by God
[58:04] Himself listen we're alive we're still
[58:11] here we're still listening we're still
[58:14] speaking we're still what getting thing
[58:18] getting revelation so it's for me and
[58:21] you that's just a way out it's just for
[58:24] me and you mayor
[58:28] didn't sit there and go through a
[58:30] checklist that day that the she asks one
[58:32] question how can a woman that's not met
[58:37] a man have a baby and what the Angels
[58:40] say ain't nothing too hard for God he
[58:44] didn't explain how it was gonna happen
[58:46] he said ain't nothin too hard for God
[58:49] and she said okay be it unto me
[58:52] according to thy word but she had to
[58:55] receive it that's what we're gonna talk
[58:57] about now what we're leading up to is
[58:58] there is a physical death and there's a
[59:03] spiritual death okay if you don't
[59:09] believe that I'm glory we're brother
[59:10] Branham said it now they don't have
[59:11] they've gotten this one but I'm gonna
[59:13] read I pulled the brother Dale I pulled
[59:15] up a 7 a and a B and I didn't have time
[59:17] to cut it with a scissors like so I'm
[59:21] gonna read this one and then we're going
[59:22] to read that one listen to listening the
[59:25] token let me tell you today as a servant
[59:27] unless the token is on the door there's
[59:30] a spiritual death going to strike and
[59:32] all churches are headed back for the
[59:35] Council of world council of churches
[59:37] they're all going back to Catholicism
[59:40] and only those who are genuine
[59:42] born-again is going to stay out he said
[59:47] let me tell you as a servant this is
[59:50] what's going to happen
[59:50] remember not your Pentecostal
[59:52] denomination because you've already
[59:54] you're already in it shows they are dead
[59:59] they are perished they sacrificed they
[1:00:02] went back they put him outside the door
[1:00:04] but he is looking for the token because
[1:00:07] the only thing they relied upon was
[1:00:09] speaking in tongues don't you allow them
[1:00:11] speaking in tongues no nothing else but
[1:00:14] let the token itself be there the person
[1:00:16] of Jesus Christ his own life and UCO's
[1:00:19] remember when you come to Egypt that's
[1:00:22] right
[1:00:22] when you come to Egypt though that was
[1:00:24] all substitute that blood of that lamb
[1:00:27] didn't come back into those believers
[1:00:29] because you know what as soon as they
[1:00:31] left and went out into the wilderness
[1:00:32] they're going why do we do this
[1:00:36] Moses you brought us out here and we're
[1:00:40] sick and we why not we're safe but we're
[1:00:42] huh
[1:00:42] green with week ain't got nothing to
[1:00:44] drink no that was under a natural lamb
[1:00:53] that was a substitute but when that lamb
[1:00:56] comes inside of me and you you say all
[1:01:00] we have our bad days sure we have our
[1:01:02] bad days and our good days but Christ
[1:01:04] lives in you and he'll take you on
[1:01:07] through that journey it wasn't a sub
[1:01:08] this ain't a substitute we're living
[1:01:10] under we're living under the real and
[1:01:12] then we're not living under no there is
[1:01:14] no substitute in this word it's the real
[1:01:18] thing or it's nothing amazing of God in
[1:01:22] 1964 they spiritually died now this is a
[1:01:26] spiritual veil that was a natural veil
[1:01:30] now what is he talking about the Holy of
[1:01:31] Holies that was a natural veil this is a
[1:01:34] spiritual veil they kept walking right
[1:01:37] on in behind there you can tell them oh
[1:01:39] I know I know that scene go ahead that's
[1:01:42] all right it only speaks you remember
[1:01:44] the last plague in Egypt was death
[1:01:47] before the Exodus the last plague on
[1:01:49] this earth is spiritual death before the
[1:01:52] Exodus then they'll be cremated and
[1:01:54] turned back to the dust it's pretty hard
[1:01:57] by the Brenham they'll be cremated and
[1:01:59] turned back to the dust and the
[1:02:00] righteous will walk out on their ashes
[1:02:02] but the last thing is spiritual death
[1:02:05] rejecting the word and then so we're
[1:02:09] going to look at two deaths just for a
[1:02:10] few minutes and I'll pull that one back
[1:02:11] up here on the spoken words original
[1:02:12] seed because remember Eve's death did
[1:02:17] not begin in her physical womb Mary's
[1:02:26] life that she accepted did not come in
[1:02:29] their womb first natural one worse you
[1:02:34] have to accept it first appear same way
[1:02:37] with any of us in it the brother branham
[1:02:39] explains it and I'm not going to explain
[1:02:40] it here but why I'm sorry you read I put
[1:02:44] it in there so let's let him let's let
[1:02:45] him answer that so what is that camera
[1:02:50] that don't over dealing with
[1:02:54] you don't know okay let's just see in
[1:02:56] the back of my head I'm gonna stand over
[1:03:00] here like this I'm not one I want to
[1:03:02] break the where they can see this online
[1:03:04] this was both physical and spiritual
[1:03:08] with Eve first and anytime so anytime
[1:03:14] this is what's going to happen I told
[1:03:17] you ask you this morning sister to
[1:03:19] forgive me so I can mention that any
[1:03:21] time that a woman takes the wrong step
[1:03:23] I'm talking about Christ in the bride
[1:03:24] now but he is going to the natural but
[1:03:27] anytime a woman takes a wrong step she
[1:03:30] has to first receive it in her mind
[1:03:33] right the angel didn't come to Mary and
[1:03:39] say Mary I've already placed something
[1:03:40] in your womb no he had to talk to her he
[1:03:43] had to get her to confess be it unto me
[1:03:48] according I were he didn't he didn't
[1:03:50] plant the seed and tell her about it
[1:03:54] that's not what it is but anytime a
[1:03:58] woman takes a wrong step she has to
[1:04:00] first receive it in her mind right some
[1:04:03] slicker has to persuade her and she
[1:04:06] listens to it against her own better
[1:04:08] judgment than the act is committed so
[1:04:11] first it hit Satan hit Eve's mind he
[1:04:17] said what's this got to do to the fourth
[1:04:18] seal for seal his death it's named death
[1:04:21] we must look at natural listen spiritual
[1:04:24] death is causing natural death natural
[1:04:27] death is not causing spiritual death
[1:04:29] spiritual death is causing natural death
[1:04:32] because she died spiritually first in
[1:04:35] the womb of her mind now not her soul
[1:04:38] that's what we're talking bout this
[1:04:39] morning not in the if so her soul was
[1:04:41] eternal she had that theophany of
[1:04:43] Genesis 1:26 man so this is what that
[1:04:46] middle memory reason conscious affects
[1:04:48] an imagination Eve
[1:04:50] Satan hit Eve's mind he said all you
[1:04:53] can't do wrong if you're born again you
[1:04:58] must live somewhere I don't hello
[1:05:03] you must live somewhere I don't live so
[1:05:06] that's where my problem is that middle
[1:05:08] man
[1:05:08] memory reason conscious affection
[1:05:10] imagination that has not been turned
[1:05:12] back but by what by the Word of God it
[1:05:15] will be it is being born again brother
[1:05:19] John it is being born again he asked the
[1:05:21] question last night
[1:05:23] well John asked a question this or this
[1:05:26] and me and daddy both answered at the
[1:05:28] same time yes I mean it was two cars it
[1:05:30] was it should have been a yes and a no
[1:05:32] but it was both of them yes well that's
[1:05:34] what it is because you're being born
[1:05:35] again these things are being birthed in
[1:05:38] you the only way that we can ever be
[1:05:41] born again
[1:05:42] is first in the womb of the mind receive
[1:05:48] the word then the Spirit comes on top of
[1:05:52] that and brings it to life there you are
[1:05:57] amen to me that's so simple but you had
[1:06:02] to hear the word first because remember
[1:06:12] what brother Branham said about Mary
[1:06:15] that Mary and her momma or even Mary and
[1:06:19] Joseph had talked about Isaiah where a
[1:06:22] virgin shall conceive so she had
[1:06:24] received that's like the woman at the
[1:06:26] well they don't go back and look at that
[1:06:28] scripture of the woman at the well the
[1:06:31] woman at the well says we know that when
[1:06:35] Messiah comes in other words she wasn't
[1:06:38] reading playboy magazine she was doing
[1:06:40] that but she wasn't reading she had read
[1:06:42] the Bible she had just got a wrong
[1:06:45] spirit owner but she had read the Bible
[1:06:47] or the Old Testament scroll she had read
[1:06:50] the Old Testament Scrolls and said we
[1:06:52] know when Messiah comes jesus said that
[1:06:58] how quicker quicker nothing else but
[1:07:02] that I'll quicken that when Messiah
[1:07:04] comes he'll do these things and he said
[1:07:07] I am he she didn't have to go back and
[1:07:09] reread the scroll again she had already
[1:07:13] read it that's why you brothers and
[1:07:18] sisters with wives and husbands and
[1:07:19] children this out
[1:07:21] that are not born again somewhere I
[1:07:26] don't care where it is my kids have
[1:07:29] heard the word and somewhere God's gonna
[1:07:32] click on that one they'll stop when
[1:07:34] they'll stop somewhere and let God speak
[1:07:38] to her then that word that they held I
[1:07:45] just believe that there you are that's
[1:07:49] what does it that's the real gospel
[1:07:51] teaching brother and I believe he kind
[1:07:53] of got a little excited that's the real
[1:07:55] gospel teacher brethren I believe if
[1:07:57] Saint Paul was standing today he'd teach
[1:08:00] the same thing I do in this hour what
[1:08:03] was the results with her now somebody's
[1:08:06] physical and spiritual death all right
[1:08:10] what is the results of those who accept
[1:08:13] the other way it goes into this frolic
[1:08:16] today that they got both physical and
[1:08:18] spiritual death both body and spirit
[1:08:21] shall be annihilated be no more that's
[1:08:23] exactly right you know to me that would
[1:08:27] be the most horrible thing because we're
[1:08:32] all human beings we all have a persona
[1:08:36] or
[1:08:37] we're all persons but one day all these
[1:08:41] people that don't accept Jesus Christ as
[1:08:43] their Savior just you ever thought about
[1:08:47] that it's like they never were here they
[1:08:51] never were in the mind of God except in
[1:08:53] the part of knowing that life was going
[1:08:55] to happen but in the eternal section the
[1:08:58] only way you can be known eternal is to
[1:09:01] be in the eternal section much betting
[1:09:05] on you okay
[1:09:11] but that's it though you just go away
[1:09:15] you're never to be remembered again you
[1:09:19] listen you're walking dead
[1:09:21] you have no substance you have nothing
[1:09:23] if you're not born again nothing both
[1:09:28] body and spirit shall be annihilated be
[1:09:32] no more that's exactly right because you
[1:09:36] know what Satan's gonna hass gonna
[1:09:38] happen to him too
[1:09:41] amens that all right
[1:09:42] Saints gonna have them Satan too now let
[1:09:45] me read this one right here I don't know
[1:09:53] which we want to read first let's go
[1:09:55] this one the one I've got you don't have
[1:09:57] all right this is from that time 1962 if
[1:10:00] you want to pull it up it put in now
[1:10:04] even to this day and you and you'll get
[1:10:06] it should be 1962 seven thirteen from
[1:10:09] that time okay in Washington cuz I want
[1:10:11] you to read this one I want you to
[1:10:17] listen to me look I don't look over
[1:10:18] there if the last death is spiritual
[1:10:25] death before the Exodus
[1:10:29] then in contrast to that there's got to
[1:10:34] be full life no that's what you're
[1:10:41] living now there's got other words the
[1:10:43] full words got to be restored the full
[1:10:45] life has got an eternal life has got to
[1:10:47] be walking on the earth for spiritual
[1:10:49] death to hit the camp amen now even to
[1:10:53] this day that same Holy Spirit that has
[1:10:55] lifted us up from a life of sin where we
[1:10:58] once lived and we've already dead in
[1:11:02] Christ listen I told him last night
[1:11:06] before it work now we're going to talk
[1:11:09] about though we're heading into
[1:11:10] resurrection next service would be
[1:11:12] resurrection to have a resurrection
[1:11:15] there's going to be a death you can't
[1:11:19] resurrect something's life
[1:11:21] gotta be dead that's why we got to talk
[1:11:25] about physical and spiritual death
[1:11:26] because there's a physical death in the
[1:11:27] spiritual that I'm in now even to this
[1:11:31] day that same Holy Spirit that has
[1:11:33] lifted us up from a life of sin where we
[1:11:35] once lived
[1:11:35] we've already dead in Christ buried and
[1:11:38] raised with him in his resurrection I
[1:11:41] want to make a point that just in a few
[1:11:44] minutes
[1:11:44] and setting now in heavenly places with
[1:11:47] him amen
[1:11:48] watching him work among us why why I
[1:11:53] ain't out yonder he can say some things
[1:11:57] about why ain't I out yonder amongst of
[1:12:00] the denomination's because it's those
[1:12:02] that are dead and buried in him and
[1:12:04] raised with him in his resurrection and
[1:12:06] now not we will be we are now in
[1:12:10] heavenly places in Christ Jesus
[1:12:12] now we've read this a million times we
[1:12:15] all have but listen looking back to
[1:12:18] where we once came from where we came
[1:12:21] from what we're doing here and where
[1:12:24] we're going I told him this morning that
[1:12:26] takes the fear factor out of all that
[1:12:28] brother Ron thank you for that I read
[1:12:30] that this morning and Sunday school he
[1:12:32] wrote me a good little note about fear
[1:12:34] fear is false evidence appearing real
[1:12:37] but you know why you're afraid of
[1:12:38] something because you don't know what
[1:12:41] the outcome is as human beings we try
[1:12:44] the best we can and sometimes it flops
[1:12:46] but now in God that don't happen any
[1:12:50] mess we make is ours it's not God's a
[1:12:53] man but the fear we have is that it will
[1:12:55] do something wrong or the fear that we
[1:12:57] have is we'll do something and don't
[1:12:58] know what the outcome is God's never had
[1:13:01] fear he knows what the outcome is as
[1:13:03] soon as he thinks that he sees it and
[1:13:05] it's already happened how can you fit so
[1:13:07] you know what you and I are prophetic
[1:13:09] people now what does the prophetic
[1:13:12] people do brother Branham looked back
[1:13:14] and said I saw you sitting on a young
[1:13:19] sleep to this if you want to but I think
[1:13:21] it's pretty profound brother Branham
[1:13:24] looked back and saw you sitting saw
[1:13:26] somebody sitting on the the ramp said I
[1:13:29] see you sitting in the doctor's office
[1:13:30] and the darks are telling you what what
[1:13:32] was he looking forward no he's looking
[1:13:34] back
[1:13:35] he was in a prophetic realm looking back
[1:13:38] at what something that happened two days
[1:13:40] before a month before six months before
[1:13:42] right the person was standing there he
[1:13:45] said I feel you're Christian so that's
[1:13:47] right then he said now I see you like
[1:13:53] Bill Dow laying in a hospital bed dead
[1:13:58] almost brother Gramps that I see you
[1:14:01] shaking my hand in the Tabernacle when
[1:14:04] in the future that's prophetic utterance
[1:14:09] that is what you and I have got to have
[1:14:12] you and I have got to see where we came
[1:14:14] from know what we're doing here but we
[1:14:17] know where we're going
[1:14:18] forget about the situation it's already
[1:14:21] done because that's where the fear comes
[1:14:25] in the fear comes in when we say well I
[1:14:27] don't know where I'm going no you can't
[1:14:28] do that watch and now not we will be we
[1:14:32] are now in heavenly places in Christ
[1:14:34] Jesus
[1:14:34] looking back to we were once came from a
[1:14:39] direct evidence that we receive part of
[1:14:43] it because we are dead and our life is
[1:14:46] hidden gone through Christ and already
[1:14:48] raised again in the resurrection with
[1:14:50] him amen oh my like the old color sister
[1:14:53] said she said I'm not going to ought to
[1:14:55] be I'm not going to want to be but I'm
[1:14:57] sure not what I used to be all right so
[1:15:00] let's go now to the one that we have
[1:15:01] here number eight brothers the way of a
[1:15:07] true prophet 1962 and then he gave us
[1:15:10] all things now we have the earnest of
[1:15:11] our inheritance now listen close
[1:15:14] and I ain't preaching on that subject
[1:15:15] but it just feels good for me right now
[1:15:17] see that we have the earnest for that
[1:15:20] for one day we walked in sin and after
[1:15:23] being baptized in his name and raised
[1:15:24] with him in resurrection we've been
[1:15:26] brought out of sin never no more to want
[1:15:28] to go back again we are raised from sin
[1:15:31] with the evidence that we have keep
[1:15:34] rolling
[1:15:35] we're potentially in the resurrection
[1:15:37] from all death
[1:15:39] see if we could raise up from sin by
[1:15:41] faith in him and there is sin we would
[1:15:44] want to go back would who would want to
[1:15:46] go back to the garbage can of sin again
[1:15:49] we've passed from death to life and
[1:15:51] that's the earnest that's the earnest of
[1:15:54] the complete resurrection all death
[1:15:56] physically physically he talked about
[1:15:59] spiritual death he's on my physical
[1:16:00] death and spiritual we've done overcome
[1:16:04] spiritual death because we passed from
[1:16:08] death unto life now I love this right
[1:16:11] here as Elijah went down to Jordan now
[1:16:14] remember in Elijah type move crossing
[1:16:19] Elijah taught the bride amen
[1:16:21] all right as Elijah went down to Jordan
[1:16:23] one day and struck it with Elijah Elijah
[1:16:25] and it parted back he crossed over he
[1:16:28] came back with a double portion and when
[1:16:30] we strike Jordan with Christ we got one
[1:16:35] portion but when we return we're coming
[1:16:38] with two portions we got eternal life
[1:16:42] resurrection from sin now in
[1:16:45] righteousness with the Holy Ghost and
[1:16:47] then on the return with Christ we come
[1:16:51] back with both physical resurrection and
[1:16:53] we've already got spiritual rigors of
[1:16:55] resurrection we have a double portion of
[1:16:58] it Amen so if you're already resurrected
[1:17:00] spiritually sitting in heavenly places
[1:17:03] those who he's justified he's already
[1:17:05] glorified that's why we take a that's
[1:17:08] why we take a rapture on the fourth seal
[1:17:10] cuz everything's all culminated the
[1:17:12] justification has went to what
[1:17:14] glorification because we get a glorified
[1:17:16] body while we're on earth no one speak
[1:17:22] just for a second don't pull up number
[1:17:25] nine yet but we were talking yesterday
[1:17:28] about adoption now what happens in
[1:17:31] adoption is is that when you adopt
[1:17:34] someone all of their records are wiped
[1:17:39] away from their past we talked about
[1:17:44] this a little bit last night because
[1:17:47] when you come to adoption you get a new
[1:17:50] name and I'm gonna read that next Sunday
[1:17:52] but I'm just gonna give you a little
[1:17:53] seed for about five minutes and it will
[1:17:55] close mm-hmm you and I
[1:18:01] were born ain't come about mom and dad
[1:18:04] we were born in sin we were born in a
[1:18:07] family a family of death between Satan
[1:18:12] and Eve of the prophet of God said Amen
[1:18:15] but when God took us and the right of
[1:18:18] adoption is is you take somebody from
[1:18:20] one family and place them into another
[1:18:22] family that sound good it sounds good to
[1:18:28] me because I don't want be in that
[1:18:29] family no more
[1:18:31] but when he adopts me into the family my
[1:18:33] old records struck listen number 9
[1:18:36] invisible Union what's this
[1:18:38] well you separated from your first Union
[1:18:42] by spiritual death now you are born
[1:18:46] again are remarried again to the new
[1:18:48] spiritual union of not your natural life
[1:18:51] of the things of the world but of
[1:18:53] eternal life that germ that was in you
[1:18:56] at the beginning found you and then now
[1:18:59] you're old book is gone with your old
[1:19:06] Union now your name and you're old and
[1:19:11] has been transferred you get a new birth
[1:19:14] certificate because that's what it means
[1:19:17] to be born again it means your first
[1:19:20] birth was wrong and you needed to be
[1:19:23] born again how simple is that
[1:19:27] do you mean to tell me that my old book
[1:19:30] God put it in the sea of his
[1:19:32] forgetfulness you can't take an adopted
[1:19:37] person and check their record back but
[1:19:38] to the adoption time all other records
[1:19:45] are struck amen God put in the sea of
[1:19:51] his forgetfulness you stand perfectly
[1:19:53] before God now your name is now in the
[1:19:57] new book not the book of life but the
[1:20:00] Lamb's Book of Life what the Lamb
[1:20:02] redeemed not the old book of your
[1:20:05] natural union but your new bride
[1:20:09] hallelujah your new life is in the
[1:20:11] Lamb's Book of Life your marriage
[1:20:12] certificate hallelujah
[1:20:14] were your true eternal germ from the
[1:20:16] beginning takes hold why before the
[1:20:19] foundation of the world you were in the
[1:20:20] mind of God he wrote the words so that
[1:20:23] you could get the word respond to the
[1:20:25] word and that's the only seed there is
[1:20:27] it's not a little wiggle tail running
[1:20:30] around in your body somewhere this
[1:20:32] eternal I I just don't believe that now
[1:20:36] you're not only forgiven but you're
[1:20:38] justified don't want to ask you a
[1:20:41] question just this is this is like
[1:20:43] brother Darrell does sometimes let me
[1:20:45] ask you a question and we ain't gonna
[1:20:46] preach on it for two weeks I've always
[1:20:49] thought I've always had a question that
[1:20:55] the Bible says that we which are alive
[1:20:59] and remain shall not prevent or hinder
[1:21:01] those which are asleep I'm reading
[1:21:03] Thessalonians 4 the trumpet of God shall
[1:21:06] sound the dead in Christ shall rise
[1:21:08] first then we which are alive and remain
[1:21:14] shall be caught up together now I kind
[1:21:19] of had a problem with that go see I'm
[1:21:21] looking at this how can we preach a
[1:21:29] resurrection message and we weren't
[1:21:33] changed first you never thought about
[1:21:36] that how can that how can that life come
[1:21:41] out of me and I'm still living in this
[1:21:45] dead thing this is dead if you don't
[1:21:48] know that or not I'm not y'all know
[1:21:50] y'all not viewing me today but this is
[1:21:53] the preview if the time goes on we all
[1:21:56] go on view each other you understand
[1:21:59] what I mean physical I know I've already
[1:22:03] spiritually died I've already
[1:22:05] spiritually went in heavenly places in
[1:22:07] other words my old Union everything we
[1:22:09] just talked about but how how can me I'm
[1:22:17] not changed I know it's a revelation but
[1:22:22] somewhere in the Bible it's got to tell
[1:22:23] me this
[1:22:26] let's read it pull it up
[1:22:30] John 11 this answered a question for me
[1:22:34] and I hope it answered the question for
[1:22:36] you then Martha said unto Jesus Lord if
[1:22:39] thou has been here my brother had not
[1:22:41] died but I know that even now whatsoever
[1:22:44] thou will ask of God God will give it
[1:22:47] thee Jesus said unto her thy brother
[1:22:49] shall rise again Martha said unto him I
[1:22:53] know that he shall rise again in the
[1:22:55] resurrection at the last day
[1:22:58] she throwed it way 2,000 years down the
[1:23:01] road right what Jesus said now this is a
[1:23:04] man this is what I like this is a
[1:23:11] physical mortal man its flesh it's not
[1:23:18] eternal he's dying his self hello he's
[1:23:27] dying his self you are 30 years old let
[1:23:31] me know it says you're 50 you seen
[1:23:33] Abraham you're not even 50 years old
[1:23:34] he was 30 he was physically dying in
[1:23:37] that body standing in that great front
[1:23:40] of that grave and he says I am I am the
[1:23:48] resurrection he denied the body he was
[1:23:53] standing in he denied the body that he
[1:23:58] was standing in you and I have to deny
[1:24:00] the body that we're standing in see
[1:24:05] that's been my problem I'm like man what
[1:24:07] a great act
[1:24:08] brother Gary what a great act that was
[1:24:10] sitting up here preaching and Robert
[1:24:12] Tatum walks through the door through the
[1:24:15] door
[1:24:16] they'll have to open it walks through
[1:24:18] the door and he's standing in the
[1:24:22] glorified body and we're standing here
[1:24:24] still dying but it has nothing to do
[1:24:28] with that Jesus was standing on earth
[1:24:31] when he said that right there and he was
[1:24:33] heading toward death itself in the
[1:24:34] physical in the physical flesh so to me
[1:24:38] that answers the question
[1:24:42] what's all this greatness it's inside
[1:24:46] it's inside he didn't nod cuz look
[1:24:52] here's the key
[1:24:55] Martha is throwing it 2,000 years down
[1:24:58] the road you know what she's doing she's
[1:25:02] lying about what she said a minute ago
[1:25:05] whatever you say Lord roll it back down
[1:25:09] Ignis us but Martha said unto Jesus Lord
[1:25:12] if thou been here my brother had not
[1:25:14] died but I know that even now whatsoever
[1:25:19] thou will ask of God God will give it to
[1:25:22] thee
[1:25:23] jesus said thy brother shall rise again
[1:25:28] now watch her carnality Martha said unto
[1:25:32] him I've no know that he shall rush she
[1:25:35] was denying that he was the resurrection
[1:25:37] she was you know why because here Jesus
[1:25:40] walked up probably like this
[1:25:41] he'd been four days journey you know
[1:25:45] he's all stooped over and because
[1:25:47] remember we'll get to this next hour two
[1:25:49] Sundays from now remember the prayer he
[1:25:53] prays he said father it's not for me
[1:25:55] it's for these people standing around me
[1:25:58] because they're looking at this dead
[1:26:00] body that I'm living in but they don't
[1:26:02] see that I am the resurrection and the
[1:26:06] life he that believeth in me though he
[1:26:09] were dead yet shall he live and
[1:26:12] whosoever liveth and believeth in me
[1:26:16] shall never die my question do you
[1:26:20] believe it though this the stand our
[1:26:22] feet believe us now this let's stand our
[1:26:26] feet believest thou this so that
[1:26:33] answered my question how can we the
[1:26:37] alive and remain be anything special it
[1:26:43] ain't got nothin to do with the flesh
[1:26:44] it's all what's inside even though even
[1:26:47] God himself was standing in a dead body
[1:26:49] when he said I am the resurrection and
[1:26:52] the
[1:26:53] what a revelation let's bow our head
[1:26:56] help me Father thank you for this day
[1:26:58] Lord and the further men of the service
[1:26:59] comes if we take communion Lord we pray
[1:27:02] that what we've said Lord has been good
[1:27:04] communion to you today Lord that
[1:27:07] everybody is is growing and we're coming
[1:27:10] together as one and we see the little
[1:27:13] bride and we see that the rough edges
[1:27:16] are being knocked off and Lord I believe
[1:27:18] you're polishing up this image that
[1:27:20] we're supposed to come into this stature
[1:27:23] of a perfect man not a statue because
[1:27:25] the fact you doesn't move you want a
[1:27:27] statue or a growth development Lord you
[1:27:30] want a moving breathing instrumentality
[1:27:32] of yourself here on the face of the
[1:27:34] earth so that one day we can stand and
[1:27:37] say I am the resurrection and the life
[1:27:39] believeth now this and the Dead is gonna
[1:27:42] walk in among us regardless of how old
[1:27:45] we get or what all any circumstance
[1:27:47] looks in this flesh Paul said in Romans
[1:27:52] 8:1 there is therefore now no
[1:27:54] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[1:27:56] Jesus who walk not after the flesh but
[1:27:58] after the spirit Lord forgive us of our
[1:28:01] sins that we commit against you Lord all
[1:28:04] the all the bad thoughts and bad things
[1:28:08] we do Lord just being human and not
[1:28:11] treating people right and all the
[1:28:12] different things Lord that we all we all
[1:28:14] have those things that we do litter that
[1:28:16] are wrong Lord I pray that you'd forgive
[1:28:18] us Lord sanctifies for their journey
[1:28:20] thank to Fox now especially as we take
[1:28:22] this communion Lord that it will
[1:28:25] actually plus all Lord to come together
[1:28:30] and stay clean and be ready for this
[1:28:33] journey because I believe truly that
[1:28:35] were standing on the face of this earth
[1:28:37] somebody's gonna say them and it's not
[1:28:40] just a little Lazarus gonna come forth
[1:28:41] it's gonna be all the saints from Paul
[1:28:44] all the way down to here we're gonna
[1:28:46] walk in among us and we're gonna get out
[1:28:48] of here father we thank you for all
[1:28:50] things bless us Lord take care of us be
[1:28:53] with us Lord and the further ment of
[1:28:54] this service and Jesus name we pray Lord
[1:28:56] be with us in the weeks coming up Lord
[1:28:58] that you'll take care of us
[1:29:00] bless us in Jesus name Amen you love the
[1:29:03] Lord but think of that forget about the
[1:29:06] body
[1:29:07] they're now all that stuff yeah we can
[1:29:08] do all this stuff to it but Jesus was
[1:29:10] standing there and he didn't have a
[1:29:12] problem he didn't have to go brother
[1:29:14] Brown said he didn't pray up he didn't
[1:29:17] have to pray now what I believe that he
[1:29:19] didn't have to pray but he said father
[1:29:22] because of these people in other words
[1:29:25] standing around him and then here they
[1:29:27] go to this great revelation that Jesus
[1:29:29] was so human that the Bible said he wept
[1:29:32] where did he weep at the tomb of Lazarus
[1:29:33] I believe he was weeping because of
[1:29:36] their unbelief because hey listen I
[1:29:39] wouldn't weep if I knew that if if Gary
[1:29:42] brother Gary Krantz passed away and then
[1:29:44] three days later I had a vision and he
[1:29:46] was gonna walk back among us I wouldn't
[1:29:47] be crying for there I'd be rejoicing he
[1:29:51] was crying because of their unbelief
[1:29:52] they did not believe he was the
[1:29:54] resurrection even Martha was putting it
[1:29:56] 2,000 years that's what our problem is
[1:29:58] we keep going guys coming know if you're
[1:30:02] dead in Christ you're already
[1:30:03] resurrected I mean god bless you come on
[1:30:16] just give our brother a good name jesus
[1:30:23] said I am the resurrection and the life
[1:30:28] so water week we are him made manifest
[1:30:31] in another form right amen make sure you
[1:30:35] tell her brother how much you appreciate
[1:30:36] it because we believe the word right
[1:30:38] let's go to first Corinthians 11 verse
[1:30:42] 23 I have received of the Lord that
[1:30:46] which also I delivered unto you that the
[1:30:48] Lord Jesus the same night in which he
[1:30:49] was betrayed took bread and when he had
[1:30:53] given thanks he brake it and said take
[1:30:55] eat this is my body which is broken for
[1:30:58] you this doing remembrance of me after
[1:31:01] the same manner also he took the cup
[1:31:03] when he had supped saying this cup is
[1:31:06] the New Testament in my blood this do ye
[1:31:08] as oft as you drink it in remembrance of
[1:31:11] me where as often as you eat this bread
[1:31:13] and drink this cup you just use the
[1:31:15] Lord's death till he come or for
[1:31:17] whosoever shall eat this bread and
[1:31:19] this cup of the Lord unworthily she'll
[1:31:23] be guilty of the body and blood of the
[1:31:24] Lord but let a man examine himself and
[1:31:27] so let him eat of that bread and drink
[1:31:28] of that Cup for he that eateth and
[1:31:31] drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh
[1:31:33] damnation to himself not discerning the
[1:31:36] Lord's body for this cause many are weak
[1:31:38] and sickly among you and many sleep for
[1:31:42] if we would judge ourselves we should
[1:31:44] not be judged now I love this critter
[1:31:46] but when we are judged we're chasing one
[1:31:51] because we're his children right of the
[1:31:54] Lord that we should not be condemned
[1:31:56] with the world where for my brother and
[1:31:58] when you come together to eat
[1:31:59] hurry one for another and if any man
[1:32:02] hungry let him eat at home that you come
[1:32:04] out together unto condemnation the rest
[1:32:07] I said in order when I come let's just
[1:32:11] have a few moments of silent prayer
[1:32:13] praying one for the other the Lord would
[1:32:15] bless each and everyone
[1:32:30] probably thank you for your word that
[1:32:32] you've given unto us and for the light
[1:32:35] of the hour that we're able to walk in
[1:32:37] to be able to see these things just Lord
[1:32:43] forgive us when we fail you and we don't
[1:32:45] walk according to your ways and thoughts
[1:32:48] and just help each and every one of us
[1:32:50] and guide us Lord thank you for all
[1:32:53] things we pray now that you'd bless each
[1:32:56] and every one each one person here that
