[14:35] well it's good to be back with you this
[14:37] afternoon
[14:39] um
[14:40] as you know brother Aaron was supposed
[14:41] to be up here but he they were taking a
[14:43] little family vacation so surprise
[14:47] they went out I think I think they were
[14:50] in Oklahoma right right
[14:52] Wyoming thank you they went to Wyoming
[14:55] for a little vacation so that'll be a
[14:57] good time for them
[14:58] this afternoon wasn't that a fantastic
[15:01] service this morning
[15:06] and
[15:09] amen
[15:10] all right this afternoon I want to kind
[15:13] of maybe tie in some things and just
[15:15] speak from Hebrews chapter 10. and verse
[15:18] 19 to 23 we'll just read those
[15:21] scriptures
[15:22] well God was so grateful to be able to
[15:23] gather around your word once more Lord I
[15:25] pray Lord as we look into these things
[15:27] at your blessed Lord we know that many
[15:29] have needy Hearts but Lord many many are
[15:31] struggling Lord in this hour that we're
[15:32] living in Lord I pray Lord that you'll
[15:34] give us something to help those that are
[15:36] struggling Lord because Lord we know
[15:38] what the prophet said that we shouldn't
[15:39] be struggling there's a reason that we
[15:41] should be able to rest you've given us a
[15:43] recipe for rest and not for struggling
[15:45] Lord help us to be able to just relax
[15:47] into it or relax into what you promised
[15:49] and trust you the way that we ought to
[15:52] Lord granted now let your bless the
[15:54] service we pray in your name
[15:56] so if we read in Hebrews chapter 10
[15:59] verse 19
[16:01] it says
[16:03] having therefore Brethren boldness to
[16:05] enter into the Holiness by the blood of
[16:07] Jesus
[16:08] by a New and Living Way
[16:10] which he hath consecrated for us
[16:13] through the veil that is to say his
[16:15] flesh
[16:16] and having a high priest over the house
[16:19] of God
[16:20] let us draw near with a true heart and
[16:23] full Assurance of faith having our
[16:25] hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience
[16:28] and our bodies washed with pure water
[16:31] let us hold fast the profession of our
[16:34] faith without wavering for he is
[16:36] faithful that promised he may be seated
[16:39] the Lord as a blessing to the reading of
[16:40] the word
[16:43] now if if we're just
[16:45] um maybe just leave your Bible open or
[16:47] bookmark it or something that just just
[16:49] meditate on those words
[16:51] where Paul is instructing the church
[16:54] he's instructing to have boldness to
[16:57] enter into the holiest by the blood of
[16:59] Jesus and of course we know we've been
[17:01] well taught that this uh the type and
[17:05] shadows in the Old Testament are going
[17:07] from the outer Court to the inner core
[17:08] into the holiest of holies and what that
[17:11] means and what represents that you go
[17:13] into the holy of holies and there that's
[17:15] typing that you receive the baptism of
[17:18] the Holy Ghost that God himself is
[17:20] coming to abide in you and imparting you
[17:22] with his faith because it's his life and
[17:24] his person and Paul says in verse 20 by
[17:26] a New and Living Way which he hath
[17:29] consecrated for us through the veil that
[17:31] is to say his flesh
[17:33] and having an high priest over the house
[17:35] of God let us draw near with a true
[17:37] heart so we've got this this afternoon
[17:40] we've got a reason to draw near
[17:43] we've got a reason to be bold if there's
[17:45] anything that you have need of this
[17:47] afternoon we've got a reason to hold
[17:49] fast and really what I'm speaking to
[17:52] this afternoon is is for those that are
[17:55] struggling yeah brother random he would
[17:57] constantly say in this message that I'm
[17:58] reading from the inter they enter Veil
[18:00] if you happen to study that out that
[18:02] would be a good message to really go and
[18:04] study out of the inner Veil
[18:06] that he's laying out one of the things
[18:08] he's laying out in that message that
[18:10] that uh that I just want to take as a as
[18:13] a text to Struggle No More because
[18:15] there's no reason for you to be
[18:16] struggling and brother when I'm in that
[18:19] message he would say he'd say we're just
[18:20] in our infancy talking about the church
[18:22] now you think about this message now if
[18:24] you really go and meditate over the
[18:26] message to Intervale and as you even are
[18:29] sitting here listening to me speak on
[18:31] these things you're you're going to hear
[18:32] that message different way different
[18:34] depending on where you are in your
[18:36] journey it will mean something to you
[18:38] now when brother randomly he's laying
[18:39] this out he's saying we're just in our
[18:41] empathy the church is just in its
[18:44] infancy now you think about wherever you
[18:46] are in your journey if you're living in
[18:49] sin that that God is calling you into
[18:51] the holiest of holies call he's calling
[18:54] you to go through the outer core
[18:55] intercourt the holy of holy now if
[18:57] you're born again though if you're born
[18:59] again he's calling you to a greater to a
[19:01] greater Oneness and greater fellowship
[19:03] with him and that's what brother Branham
[19:04] I believe is speaking to when he says
[19:06] we're just in our infancy we're Rising
[19:09] he said don't worry we can get all these
[19:12] Fanatics and unbelievers out of the way
[19:14] we'll move on up into perfection
[19:17] after a while and you'll see signs and
[19:20] wonders and he said but we're just
[19:22] babies crawling just give us a little
[19:25] while here
[19:27] I think that should give us all
[19:29] encouragement to know that we're not
[19:31] just standing still that something's
[19:33] happening something Supernatural is
[19:35] happening that we're moving on up
[19:38] the more that you eat the word the word
[19:41] in your life is getting greater and
[19:43] greater and deeper and deeper and higher
[19:45] and better all the time now listen to
[19:49] the way brother Branham said this he
[19:50] said the next thing God will step in
[19:53] with higher Miracles and greater things
[19:56] on greater planes and as Jesus when he
[19:59] was here on Earth the first coming of
[20:01] the Lord Jesus it showed John the
[20:03] Baptist miraculous death then the
[20:06] miraculous of Jesus then come in the
[20:08] healing of the sick and the discernment
[20:10] of the spirits then on down into the
[20:13] raising of the dead and from that on
[20:15] down to the earth and the heavens and
[20:17] everything declaring him then the Earth
[20:19] giving up is dead now I wonder if you
[20:22] listen when you listen to that that you
[20:24] could hear you can hear echoed in those
[20:27] in those words three stages of a journey
[20:30] now I I really enjoyed that message this
[20:32] morning I remember
[20:34] talking about the the mirror and looking
[20:36] at the mirror I remember years ago uh
[20:39] listening to a sermon that brother
[20:40] Donnie Reagan preached and he was
[20:42] talking about he was preaching on
[20:43] looking into the mirror of God's word
[20:45] and he compared it with looking through
[20:47] three stages as well and and what what's
[20:49] happening as you keep looking into the
[20:51] mirror you're looking at you're looking
[20:52] in the mirror when you're a sinner
[20:53] you're looking when you were born again
[20:55] you're looking when you as you grow
[20:56] you're looking you keep looking and as
[20:59] you look into the mirror you ever that
[21:01] phase is changing because you're
[21:02] becoming more and more like Jesus and
[21:04] you see your your own self dropping away
[21:07] and you see your own self fading away
[21:09] and you're becoming you're becoming
[21:10] you're becoming what the word expressed
[21:13] where the person that you used to be
[21:15] ain't there anymore you've been
[21:17] transformed by the word actually
[21:18] changing your life and brother Brandon
[21:21] will say miraculous and miraculous all
[21:23] the way along so you just keep deeper
[21:25] and deeper and deeper to a climax
[21:30] now you you think look at all these road
[21:33] maps that we have laid out for us in the
[21:34] Old Testament the road map of Abraham's
[21:36] life the three stages of Abraham's life
[21:39] and the three stages of David's life and
[21:41] and the journey that Ruth went on and
[21:43] the journey that David all these all
[21:44] these different ones went on and all of
[21:46] these came to a head when you could look
[21:48] at the life of Jesus that Jesus's life
[21:51] is a road map that we can compare our
[21:53] own life to three stages from baptism to
[21:56] complete death to self he was baptized
[21:58] on the River Jordan he went up on Mount
[22:00] Transfiguration and he died on the
[22:02] Garden of Gethsemane to himself and went
[22:04] up on the on the cross and gave up a
[22:06] complete death to himself where he said
[22:08] father forgive him for they don't they
[22:10] don't know what they do
[22:12] and you can look at look you can look at
[22:14] all these types and identify yourself
[22:16] with the same Journey the same thing
[22:18] that's going on and you know to think
[22:21] this afternoon that that's the purpose
[22:23] of this message that we've got something
[22:25] different than what the world offers
[22:27] we've got something different that you
[22:29] you go online and you listen to
[22:30] something that maybe Joel Osteen or
[22:33] Joseph Prince or any of the different
[22:35] ones that you know the preachers that
[22:37] get on the stage with their glass
[22:38] pulpits and so forth and I'm not
[22:40] knocking them or but you know we don't
[22:42] we've got something different than
[22:44] psychology and self-help we we've got
[22:47] something that they can't offer and what
[22:49] is that thing that we have that they
[22:50] can't offer what we've got is the
[22:52] mystery the complete mystery of
[22:54] redemption I'm talking about the the the
[22:57] the journey that I was just talking
[23:00] about that where you can look into the
[23:01] Bible and identify your own life with a
[23:04] journey that these Believers in the Old
[23:06] Testament and with the life of Jesus
[23:09] you think you think this morning the
[23:11] reason that we come to church sitting
[23:12] here the reason really is because we
[23:14] want to see unveiled in our own life the
[23:17] mystery of redemption the complete
[23:18] mystery of redemption and so many of you
[23:20] you know you're sitting here and you're
[23:22] listening you're hungry and you're
[23:23] you're you're hanging on every word
[23:25] because what you're you're wanting that
[23:27] culmination of our faith the revelation
[23:30] of the Seven Seals to be revealed in
[23:32] your life which reveals to you that
[23:34] reveals to you the full mystery of
[23:36] redemption oh to think now I I can go
[23:38] back into my own life and remember 20
[23:41] years ago you know you come and you sit
[23:43] in church and you don't understand any
[23:44] things but I one thing I did understand
[23:46] was that brother Dale had understood
[23:49] what the Seven Seals were and you know
[23:51] sitting here this today maybe there's a
[23:53] lot of things that you struggle with and
[23:55] you you kind of battle with but I tell
[23:57] you one thing that we're all hungering
[23:58] for is the Seven Seals and that's one
[24:01] thing that this message has to offer
[24:02] that nobody else has to offer that God
[24:04] himself came down with a shout and the
[24:07] voice and the Trump of a mighty Angel
[24:08] yeah he came down just like
[24:10] Thessalonians said he came down to get
[24:12] to deliver to you the mystery of the
[24:15] seven seal book of redemption now when
[24:17] you can look into the book and see your
[24:18] own life to see yourself identify
[24:21] that you know
[24:24] then you know it's real God has given us
[24:27] everything we need for the journey if
[24:29] we'll just accept it
[24:31] now you go let's go back let's go back
[24:33] to the very foundation of the journey
[24:35] and brother Brown was preaching in the
[24:37] message to Intervale he said he said a
[24:39] few nights ago and that whole message
[24:41] he's preaching on this little girl in
[24:42] the hospital he said a few nights ago I
[24:45] was called to an emergency call of a
[24:47] young lady dying at the Clark County
[24:49] Memorial Hospital
[24:51] she was 19 or 20 years old and she had a
[24:54] four-month baby that has adults could
[24:56] read between between the lines and
[24:58] understands she had a four-month baby
[25:00] this little 19 or 20 years ago old girl
[25:03] and she said she made this statement to
[25:04] brother Ryan she said brother Brown I
[25:06] tell you said I still love the Lord
[25:08] Jesus but said I find it so hard to
[25:12] serve him now you think about a
[25:14] statement this morning now as brother
[25:16] brother Louise was preaching this
[25:17] morning about looking into the word and
[25:19] seeing seeing it what how we are and you
[25:22] know sometimes you look into the word
[25:23] and and you'll you'll keep maybe maybe
[25:25] this afternoon you look into the word
[25:27] and you don't get a good response back
[25:29] maybe you look into the word and you get
[25:31] a response back that shows that you
[25:33] ain't where you need to be and that's
[25:35] what the predicament of this little girl
[25:36] laying in this hospital bed 19 or 20
[25:39] years old that's where she found herself
[25:41] that she was not where she needed to be
[25:44] but she ended up with this four month
[25:45] baby you know sometimes the devil will
[25:47] get you into a state where you look at
[25:49] your life and you say I wish I'd made
[25:50] other decisions I made I wish I'd gone
[25:52] down another road well now you find
[25:54] yourself in this situation oh that's
[25:56] what Grace is for Grace Grace can Grace
[25:59] can fix your problems with all the pro
[26:01] all the situation that you've got
[26:02] yourself into all the bad financial
[26:05] decisions that oh you just turn it over
[26:07] to God and if you're really yield
[26:09] yourself to God and not just some kind
[26:10] of a play thing but really turn yourself
[26:13] over to God oh you think all those times
[26:16] that people would come up in the prayer
[26:17] line and before they would be healed
[26:18] brother Brandon would ask him he said
[26:20] are you going to give your life to Jesus
[26:22] now that's what Jesus wants he's he
[26:24] wants to you to give your life to him if
[26:27] you'll give your life to him then then
[26:28] he'll give you everything that you have
[26:30] need of he promised he would be your
[26:33] provider if you'll give everything to
[26:35] him that he'll he'll bankrupt Heaven
[26:38] before he'll let any of his promises go
[26:41] the check bounce now now this little
[26:45] sister in the hospital saying I find it
[26:47] so hard to serve him I wonder this
[26:49] afternoon of course you know you don't
[26:50] have to raise your hand or anything you
[26:52] just just let the word echo in your
[26:54] heart is is that the situation that you
[26:56] find yourself in this afternoon that you
[26:58] find it hard to serve him because it's
[27:00] not supposed to be hard to be a
[27:02] Christian right
[27:03] right isn't that a perplexing thing to
[27:06] say there's hard things about being a
[27:08] Christian you'll go you'll go maybe to
[27:10] Walmart or somebody and people will
[27:12] laugh at you before because of the way
[27:13] that you dress or you'll go to school
[27:15] and your friends are bullying things
[27:16] like that that's not pleasant but now
[27:19] the cross has got padding on if you're
[27:21] back if you're filled with the Holy
[27:23] Ghost it's it's a padded cross the
[27:25] brother man would say in other words
[27:26] you're not supposed to be constantly
[27:28] going in and out and what is it it's the
[27:31] problem is our desire needs to be
[27:33] changed your if you're Desiring for the
[27:36] things of the world and you go to a camp
[27:38] meeting and and maybe you get you get a
[27:40] little fire in you and you start I'm
[27:42] really going to be a Christian now but
[27:44] then you go home and or maybe maybe some
[27:47] evangelist comes through even this
[27:48] church and you're sitting here listening
[27:49] to it and you get real enthused but then
[27:52] you go home and your desire is still the
[27:55] same and that desire keeps pulling you
[27:58] back to the things that you thought you
[28:00] would escape from see that's that's the
[28:02] struggle that should not be there that
[28:05] struggle shouldn't be there I believe
[28:06] this afternoon that we're preaching
[28:08] about a God that can change your desires
[28:10] to where where first you didn't want to
[28:13] come to church but now now a real
[28:15] born-again Christian is going to want a
[28:17] church which is why sometimes it's so
[28:19] you know you find preachers really
[28:21] preaching on coming to church because
[28:23] that is an identification that if you
[28:25] don't want the word if you don't want to
[28:28] be around Believers where is your desire
[28:31] if you'd rather be around grandma
[28:32] grandpa at home and and people that
[28:35] don't want to come to church and having
[28:36] birthday parties on Sunday and things
[28:38] well what's your desire
[28:40] and I know they're Straight Talk this
[28:42] afternoon I know maybe that wounds you
[28:44] but like Luis was preaching on this
[28:46] morning maybe maybe we need to be
[28:47] wounded sometimes maybe maybe sometimes
[28:50] we need somebody to yell at us so that
[28:52] we'll get out of the road before the
[28:53] truck comes and hits us I'd Rather
[28:55] somebody to yell at me to get out of the
[28:57] road than than to go my whole life and
[28:59] find up like this little sister this
[29:01] little lady did on her bed in the
[29:02] hospital and wound up brother Brown said
[29:05] her soul come up and she began to
[29:06] realize at the end of The Journey the
[29:09] condition that she was in I'd rather
[29:10] realize it now wouldn't you and I
[29:12] wouldn't you
[29:15] now brother Brown said now that is what
[29:17] I find around most Christian lives the
[29:20] most people think about this the most
[29:23] people that can profess Christianity
[29:24] they seem to have such a hard struggling
[29:27] time to hold on now that's a statement
[29:30] isn't it most people most you think
[29:32] you'd say some people but he said most
[29:35] people most people
[29:37] oh I believe it's because of a lack of
[29:40] correct teaching of the Bible he said
[29:43] there's no such a thing as holding on he
[29:46] done the holding on
[29:48] now see if you're if you're struggling
[29:50] this afternoon if you're hanging on with
[29:53] your fingertips you're on the ledge and
[29:54] your fingertips are turning to White and
[29:57] you're just struggling to just hang on I
[29:59] don't want to go back into the cussing
[30:01] and I don't want to go back into looking
[30:03] at stuff I shouldn't and I don't want to
[30:04] and you're just struggling then you're
[30:06] something's wrong you're you're doing it
[30:08] wrong because God is calling us to a
[30:10] place of rest he's calling us into the
[30:13] holy of holies where you don't struggle
[30:14] anymore there's no more struggle to a
[30:16] Christian now now don't get me wrong
[30:18] like I said there's hard things that you
[30:21] must endure as being a Christian there's
[30:23] things that you go through in life
[30:24] people say in hurtful things to you and
[30:26] so forth and all on and on but the whole
[30:29] Christian principle is based on rest
[30:33] you're resting if you're a Christian you
[30:35] ain't struggling so if you're struggling
[30:37] this afternoon let it prick you in your
[30:39] heart that there's something wrong with
[30:41] you there's something wrong with your
[30:43] experience and you've got to make it
[30:45] right you've got to make it right if you
[30:47] want to be right when God because you
[30:49] can't struggle you can't struggle and be
[30:52] a Christian in Matthew chapter 11 he
[30:54] said come unto me all ye that labor and
[30:56] are heavy laden and I will give you rest
[30:57] take my yoke upon you and learn of me
[31:01] for I am meek and lowly in heart and ye
[31:04] shall find rest unto your souls rest
[31:07] until you rest rest unto a mind that the
[31:10] devil has been bombarded and telling you
[31:11] you ain't worth nothing and you're just
[31:14] not of value to society to your family
[31:16] or you get in the holy of holies and
[31:18] shut yourself off and you'll get rest
[31:20] then you'll get rest from all those
[31:22] darts to the devil's throwing at you
[31:24] because now you can have confidence and
[31:26] what the word says you have confidence
[31:28] in what the word says because God has
[31:29] given you Faith he's given you his faith
[31:32] oh there's something that you can battle
[31:34] the devil with you're equipped then when
[31:36] you've got his faith then you you can do
[31:39] battle you can you could you have
[31:40] something to withstand everything that
[31:42] the devil throws at you because you
[31:44] believe
[31:45] well to think about that promise my yoke
[31:48] is easy and my burden is light to think
[31:50] about a promise like that now
[31:53] that you the Yoke the Yoke of
[31:56] Christianity if you get yoked up with
[31:58] Christ all those burdens and things that
[32:00] you've been carrying and burned out the
[32:02] burdens of true what what what is
[32:04] burdensome the burdensome weight of
[32:07] trying to fulfill the law by yourself
[32:10] you're just trying to do everything
[32:12] yourself you're trying to do it by works
[32:14] trying to work something up well
[32:18] trying to trying to make it happen on
[32:21] your own
[32:21] in Isaiah chapter 55 verses 1 and 2 it
[32:24] says Ho everyone that thirsteth Come Ye
[32:27] to the waters and he that hath no money
[32:30] Come Ye by and eat come buy wine and
[32:34] milk without money and without price in
[32:37] other words you don't have to do
[32:39] anything for this promise you don't have
[32:41] to pay for it you don't have to do
[32:43] anything to satisfy God
[32:46] you don't have to do anything it's by
[32:48] faith only it's not by your Works
[32:50] wherefore do you spend money for that
[32:52] which is not bread and your labor for
[32:54] that which satisfieth not
[32:57] why do you spend money for that which is
[32:59] not bread right and your labor for that
[33:01] which satisfies not why why are you
[33:04] trying to work something up parking
[33:05] diligently unto me and eat ye that which
[33:08] is good and let your soul Delight itself
[33:10] in fatness
[33:12] so this afternoon we're not preaching a
[33:14] legalistic message a message where we
[33:16] have a bunch of rules that you've got to
[33:18] follow you've got to dress a certain way
[33:20] you've got to do all these certain
[33:21] things in order to be acceptable to God
[33:23] like that but I'm preaching this
[33:25] afternoon a message where God will put
[33:27] his own life in you yes and then that
[33:29] will change you and that will be
[33:31] acceptable to God it's not works first
[33:33] but it's Faith first faith and how do
[33:36] you get faith by grace the grace of God
[33:38] extended to you that would send you
[33:41] preachers the preaching of the word so
[33:42] that it will begin to convict you and
[33:44] begin to mold your heart and soften up
[33:46] your heart and change your heart and
[33:48] change you and change you and change you
[33:50] until finally it changes you as we walk
[33:52] out of here
[33:53] so we're not preaching an Armenian
[33:55] gospel an Armenian gospel is where you
[33:57] it's by works by the things that you do
[33:59] that you've got to do something I'm not
[34:01] accepted by God this afternoon because
[34:03] of my adherence to a strict set of rules
[34:05] I'm accepted by God how do you please
[34:06] God as we've been studied out in Hebrews
[34:08] 11 by Faith by faith I'm pleasing to God
[34:11] God looks at me to see whether I believe
[34:13] his word and if I believe his word that
[34:16] is acceptable to him it's so acceptable
[34:17] to him that that Abraham's Faith was
[34:20] counted for righteousness God look to
[34:22] Abraham's Faith encountered it for
[34:24] righteousness and won't he do the same
[34:25] thing for you tonight that it's not by
[34:27] your works but it's by your faith if you
[34:29] believe God believe the promise that he
[34:31] made then he'll look at that and count
[34:33] it for righteousness and he'll overlook
[34:35] your Works he'll overlook your problems
[34:37] in your life all the wrongdoing you've
[34:39] done and he'll Overlook it just like he
[34:41] overlooked Abraham's just like he looked
[34:44] over overlooked Ruth's past and rahab's
[34:47] passed and wiped it away with the
[34:49] Egyptians he'll Overlook it because he's
[34:51] looking at your face
[34:53] can't you see how simple it is to be a
[34:56] Christian you don't have to work nothing
[34:57] up you just believe what God had already
[35:00] done it all goes back to the cross the
[35:03] cross died on the cross so that he would
[35:05] he would accomplish in his death
[35:07] everything that was necessary for you to
[35:09] have Oneness with him
[35:11] if we'll just look at cry Christ is the
[35:13] one that did the work Christ is the one
[35:16] that's doing the work it's all in Christ
[35:18] that's what Paul could say in Galatians
[35:20] chapter 2 verse 20 I am crucified with
[35:23] Christ I'm dead to myself I'm dying to
[35:26] myself nevertheless I live how do I live
[35:29] fear not I but Christ liveth in me it's
[35:32] not me doing the works anymore it's not
[35:35] me trying to build something up it's not
[35:37] me trying to force something but it's
[35:39] the Life of Christ in me that lives and
[35:41] because I believe he's put his own faith
[35:44] in me he's put his own life in me that's
[35:46] why Paul could save the life which I now
[35:48] live in the flesh I live by the faith of
[35:51] the Son of God who loved me and gave
[35:53] himself for me I live by the faith of
[35:56] the Son of God that's why brother random
[35:58] can say when you're Justified
[36:00] you're believing and it will only work
[36:02] as long as you have faith and you're
[36:04] Sanctified and you're believing but it
[36:06] will only work as long as you have faith
[36:09] and you can lose you can go away and
[36:11] lose your sanctification you can lose
[36:13] your justification you can lose that
[36:16] state because it will only work as long
[36:19] as you believe but when God gives you
[36:21] his faith it is permanent it is a
[36:24] permanent gift it's God's faith in you
[36:26] and you can never lose his faith you can
[36:29] never go back because it will last as
[36:32] long as your faith will last and when
[36:34] God gives you his faith it's permanent
[36:37] it's nothing that you do or what you can
[36:40] do it's what God has done for you in
[36:43] Christ thank you hello this afternoon if
[36:46] you're struggling if you're struggling
[36:48] won't you just put everything on Christ
[36:50] if you're struggling with something if
[36:52] you're struggling like all those things
[36:54] that brother Louise listed out this
[36:56] morning we make our list Paul made his
[36:58] list Paul's known for his list he would
[37:01] list things out in Galatians like
[37:02] Galatians chapter five now the works of
[37:05] the flesh shall manifest which are these
[37:07] adultery
[37:08] fornication uncleanness lasciviousness
[37:12] idolatry witchcraft hatred variants
[37:15] emulations wraths Strife seditions
[37:17] heresies endings murders drunkenness
[37:20] revelings and such like and the list
[37:22] goes on and on but if your thing is not
[37:24] on the list that you're struggling with
[37:26] oh you know what you're struggling with
[37:28] oh let these words echo in your heart
[37:31] and begin to convict you that there's
[37:32] there's an antidote for whatever that
[37:35] thing is that you're struggling with
[37:37] oh I seems like lately I've been hearing
[37:40] so many preachers preach on on people
[37:42] struggling with what the world is
[37:43] struggling all this LGBT stuff oh
[37:46] everybody seems to be struggling talking
[37:48] about that preaching about that listen
[37:50] listen
[37:51] there's no reason to wonder whether
[37:54] you're this or that or whether you're
[37:55] you God can change the desire to be from
[37:59] this he can make your desires be
[38:00] straightened up you can't make yourself
[38:03] stop having desires but God is able to
[38:06] change your desires God is able to take
[38:09] an evil corrupt desire for drunkenness
[38:12] or reveling or whatever it might be and
[38:15] he'll he can change your desire by the
[38:17] preaching of the Gospel
[38:19] somebody said that brother Brown says
[38:21] well I'll tell you I just quit this and
[38:22] I went to seeking God
[38:24] I just could see I see how it's worded I
[38:28] just quit that I'm gonna I'm gonna stop
[38:30] I'm gonna stop with my own accord what
[38:32] are they trying to do work Works work it
[38:34] up and you don't come to God by works I
[38:37] just quit this and I went to seeking God
[38:39] and brother man flipped it around on me
[38:41] said no you don't understand no man
[38:43] never sought God man don't seek God God
[38:47] seeks man
[38:49] in other words there is nothing that you
[38:52] can do about it there is nothing you can
[38:54] do about it in Romans chapter 3 verse 11
[38:57] it says there is none that understandeth
[38:59] there is none that seeketh after God
[39:01] there is nobody in in their sinful
[39:04] condition that's going to be go running
[39:05] after God in a way that God can answer
[39:07] back and the Garden of Eden when Adam
[39:10] got in his fix he ran behind fig leaves
[39:12] and tried to cover himself up with a
[39:14] religious situation the brogram said
[39:15] Adam alt Heaven running through the
[39:17] garden hollering father father where are
[39:19] you but it was God going through the
[39:21] Garden of Eden saying Adam Adam Where
[39:23] Art Thou and Adam hiding that's the
[39:27] nature of man it's the nature of man in
[39:29] other words you didn't have nothing
[39:31] about you don't have nothing about
[39:33] coming to God
[39:34] there's it there's nothing that you did
[39:37] to draw yourself to God God drawed you
[39:39] to Jesus there's nothing that you can do
[39:42] there's nothing no works that you can do
[39:44] it's by faith there's nothing that you
[39:46] can do in yourself to be pleasing to God
[39:48] God oh when God called you if you look
[39:51] it back in your own personal experience
[39:53] God called you God called you in
[39:55] something beginning what was it a deep
[39:57] call into the deep it wasn't because the
[39:59] minister called you or Drew here it
[40:01] wasn't because somebody conked you upset
[40:03] the head in the parking lot that that
[40:04] didn't save you like that story that
[40:06] brother likes to tell of the deacon that
[40:08] went up to Billy Paul and said don't you
[40:11] need to be at the altar but that
[40:13] wouldn't have saved him because you
[40:14] can't push it and work it up it's God
[40:16] drawing you no man can come except the
[40:19] father drawing God called you and you
[40:21] responded God called you and what
[40:23] something began to stir I got to get to
[40:25] God something began to call and draw and
[40:28] whatever you did however you responded
[40:29] if you raised up your hands in the
[40:31] congregation or failed out of the altar
[40:33] or fell down at your knee beside the bed
[40:36] it was because not because you were
[40:38] trying to work something up because you
[40:40] were responding to a god a god call
[40:44] brother Brown said when man man when he
[40:47] fell from Grace his nature was changed
[40:49] and he run from God and hid from God and
[40:52] that's still his nature a man can never
[40:55] seek God while he's a sinner God has to
[40:58] seek man and he said if you only knew
[41:01] Center Fred that the people I've talked
[41:02] to that says I don't believe in God I
[41:05] have no time for it I once tried it
[41:07] there's no I never did even desire it
[41:09] and he said I God has given you the
[41:12] desire tonight he's preaching to a
[41:14] people that they're at the altar call if
[41:16] God has given you the desire tonight to
[41:18] become a Christian don't turn him away
[41:21] oh I think one of the greatest gifts
[41:24] that there could be is that before you
[41:26] even born again is that little tug on
[41:28] your heart I I need something there's
[41:30] something something lacking in my life
[41:33] that I need something and all if there's
[41:35] something tugging in your heart this
[41:37] afternoon drawing and pulling at you
[41:39] don't don't turn him down don't grieve
[41:41] that Holy Spirit away is that don't
[41:43] grieve that Holy hush away that's
[41:45] drawing and pulling at you that's a
[41:47] Desiring to have fellowship with you
[41:49] John chapter 6 verse 44 says no man can
[41:52] come unto me except the Father which I
[41:54] sent me drawing and I will raise him up
[41:56] at the last day and what what does jaw
[41:59] mean if you really look at the
[42:00] definition of that
[42:03] that word draw means to to just drag off
[42:08] it's metaphorical to to draw by inward
[42:11] power what is this the Holy Ghost
[42:13] speaking to you to to pull at you and to
[42:16] draw you to himself in other words we
[42:18] are totally dependent on God's
[42:20] initiative and reaching out to us
[42:24] now brother Louise
[42:26] the whole congregation is starting to
[42:28] fall asleep on me so y'all y'all helped
[42:30] pull yeah I'll tell you it's it's hard
[42:33] to preach on a congregation that don't
[42:34] look like they're interested so
[42:36] it's that's just Humanity you know I
[42:38] yeah I know it kind of bothers y'all
[42:40] when ministers kind of horrible it seems
[42:42] like we're harping on that yeah wake up
[42:43] and everything but it is that's my
[42:46] Humanity it's hard it's hard to preach
[42:48] somebody with their eyes Go in different
[42:49] directions and when I open when I close
[42:51] and and they're leading up over on their
[42:53] shoulder and one eye on the wall the
[42:56] head on the wall
[42:58] so we all maybe that's just something I
[43:01] got to overcome but if it is y'all just
[43:02] pray for me we've all got things we've
[43:04] got to overcome ourselves but uh it sure
[43:07] is easier to preach when you don't feel
[43:09] like you're swimming Upstream that's
[43:10] what I'll say
[43:12] here brother Raymond the seven Church
[43:14] ages he said my brother the other night
[43:15] receiving Christ he said don't ever push
[43:18] me Bill said when God speaks to me I
[43:20] said you can't come until he calls you
[43:22] oh God is good enough to knock at your
[43:25] heart tonight and would you be foul
[43:26] enough to refuse it refuse him he said
[43:28] think of it that every person that comes
[43:31] on the invitation of the Lord Jesus
[43:33] Christ is Promised eternal life and the
[43:36] resurrection in the last day every
[43:38] person that comes on that invitation has
[43:41] a promise that you can lay claim to that
[43:43] if you come if he gives you that
[43:45] invitation it's a promise that you'll
[43:47] have eternal life so now if if God is
[43:50] calling you we're not we're not going to
[43:51] keep you away from responding oh
[43:54] if you try to just work it up and try to
[43:56] push it forward and say well I'm just
[43:58] gonna I'm gonna pray or I'm gonna go to
[44:00] church and I'm just going to try to make
[44:01] it work that won't work but if you
[44:04] respond to a call of God in your heart
[44:06] it's going to work or if you can feel
[44:09] something Supernatural churning in you
[44:11] like brother Brown when he was preaching
[44:12] look into the Unseen he said don't you
[44:14] feel that pulsating in your soul
[44:16] something pulsating in you something
[44:18] pulling at you something that's that's
[44:21] the call of God in your life and if God
[44:23] is calling come to the altar if God is
[44:26] called and lift up your hands if God is
[44:28] calling open up your heart if God is
[44:30] calling kneel in prayer nobody's going
[44:32] to stand in your way when brother Brown
[44:35] when brother round was preaching the
[44:38] Oneness of unity in in Waterloo Iowa I I
[44:41] saw a
[44:42] somebody was testifying about this on
[44:44] Facebook it was actually um you know
[44:46] Esther married Micah and it was his mom
[44:48] testifying about this on Facebook that
[44:50] she said when he when brother round
[44:52] walked up from the from the back of the
[44:53] building
[44:54] he got to her uncle
[44:56] and he put on his hand on his shoulder
[44:58] and said the only thing wrong with you
[45:00] is you don't pray enough
[45:02] find yourself a closet somewhere now to
[45:04] think now that that that might be a lot
[45:07] of our problems sitting here tonight
[45:08] that we just might not pray enough to
[45:11] you know even after you're born again
[45:13] God continues to he can certainly more
[45:16] that after you're born again he keeps
[45:17] drawing and pulling at you and maybe
[45:20] maybe this afternoon maybe you've put
[45:21] off praying and reading your Bible a
[45:23] long time but if you just get along with
[45:25] God maybe maybe this will stir you up to
[45:27] just really get along with God he even
[45:29] said you might eat too much you might
[45:31] drink too much you might laugh too much
[45:33] you might walk too much but you'll never
[45:35] pray too much why why why do you need to
[45:38] pray not need to pray like works like
[45:40] working something up but you need to
[45:41] pray to have fellowship with God so to
[45:43] get your mind in line with God and seal
[45:45] yourself off from the world and begin to
[45:47] think about what God's word says and
[45:49] commune with him what kind of a
[45:51] Christian would we be if we just neglect
[45:53] a communion with God we neglected
[45:55] getting along with God and just
[45:57] fellowshipping with him one-on-one and
[45:58] getting getting a little bit of Praise
[46:00] getting a little bit of time where we
[46:02] can can lift up our hands and worship
[46:03] just alone alone in the shower alone in
[46:06] the car with God letting the tears run
[46:08] down our face do you see you see why
[46:10] prayer is so important to a Christian
[46:11] not something to work up now not
[46:13] something to put before your faith and
[46:15] say well if you pray
[46:16] then you can be a Christian no if you'll
[46:18] respond to the god call of God in your
[46:20] life and then start praying then
[46:22] everything will work out all right but
[46:24] don't neglect praying now now why
[46:28] because God God is calling you into
[46:30] fellowship with him he's calling you
[46:31] into a private life with him he's
[46:33] calling you what to an overcoming life a
[46:35] life where you don't have to struggle
[46:37] and you see what you do in prayer is you
[46:40] get you you get in struggles of life and
[46:42] and and and trials of life and people
[46:44] say hurtful things about you and things
[46:46] happen at work the stresses of life and
[46:48] you get in prayer and you just what do
[46:50] you do and you're just dumping it all on
[46:51] God and you're having a good talk with
[46:53] your daddy having a good talk with your
[46:55] daddy like Billy Paul walked up on his
[46:57] daddy praying in his prayer closet and
[46:58] he said he said he could hear him in
[47:00] there he's crying out the papa God Papa
[47:02] God because he had a relationship with
[47:04] him and what was he doing he was having
[47:06] a fellowship with him in his prayer
[47:07] closet Fellowship fellowship and women
[47:11] communion with God and brother Adam
[47:13] would say I find that people so struggle
[47:17] seems like I meet people and they say
[47:19] it's such a struggle and probably
[47:22] there's many sitting right before me now
[47:23] that has the ups and downs the ins and
[47:27] outs this day they're all right you meet
[47:29] them and well they love the Lord today
[47:30] and tomorrow they're having such a
[47:32] struggle to hold on the devil is so
[47:34] tempted them and they're having such ups
[47:36] and downs then you meet somebody that's
[47:39] on the hilltop all the time
[47:42] now you think about that let's think
[47:44] about this for a second now
[47:46] brother there's nothing bothers them at
[47:49] all
[47:50] now you think about that that statement
[47:54] now I can't help it I can't help with
[47:55] that brother said you can come to a
[47:57] place where you don't struggle anymore
[48:00] now think about that if you're in a
[48:03] struggle this afternoon if you're
[48:04] struggling with your desires and your
[48:06] desires is pulling you maybe maybe
[48:08] you're sitting here right in church
[48:09] right now thinking I wish I could go
[48:11] home so I could go watch some YouTube
[48:12] videos I wish I could go home so I could
[48:15] cook something on the stove I wish I
[48:17] could go home because your desire is not
[48:19] here right here listening to the word of
[48:21] God and where wherever your heart is
[48:23] that's where your Treasures are going to
[48:25] be laid up that's that's now if the word
[48:28] of God is a real treasure to you that's
[48:29] what your heart is that's that's what
[48:31] you desire now I want to think about
[48:34] this that in Ephesians chapter one he
[48:36] said according as he had chosen Us in
[48:38] him before the foundation of the world
[48:39] that we should be holy and Without Blame
[48:42] before him in love that that's what God
[48:45] is calling us to he's calling us to a
[48:47] place of Holiness and to be without
[48:49] blame to think now look at look at your
[48:52] journey look at the journey that God's
[48:53] taken us through full Redemption of your
[48:55] soul and your spirit and your body that
[48:57] your soul can be without blame and holy
[49:00] that your spirit can be so lined up with
[49:04] God that brother Adam said it's like a
[49:05] solar system that the sun is at the
[49:07] middle your soul is at the middle and
[49:09] your senses are in Perfect Harmony
[49:11] around that thing on the center just
[49:13] like the solar system is that your whole
[49:15] being can be in such harmony with the
[49:17] word of God
[49:18] until the devil don't know what to do
[49:21] with you that he can throw something at
[49:23] you and you your desire is so much for
[49:25] the word and you're so walking in the
[49:27] word now now you this I know that we
[49:29] struggle with this we struggle with this
[49:30] in our mental faculty to think that God
[49:33] wants us to come to a place of such
[49:34] complete rest until there is no more
[49:37] struggle left now now some of you if you
[49:39] look back in your life some of you
[49:40] struggle with drugs some of you struggle
[49:43] with drugs and taking drugs and it might
[49:45] have been some bad drugs or it might
[49:46] have been some some of the weak drugs
[49:47] but you still struggle with drugs
[49:49] nonetheless but you don't struggle with
[49:51] that no more do you because God took the
[49:54] struggle away he took it away and you're
[49:56] not struggling with that anymore now
[49:58] that's what that's the kind that's an
[49:59] example of the kind of rest that God
[50:01] wants God is changing your life he can
[50:04] change you some of you might have
[50:05] struggled with cigarettes but not
[50:07] anymore you might have struggled with
[50:09] this or that but not anymore some of you
[50:11] some of you might have even struggled
[50:12] with coming to church some of you might
[50:14] have struggled some of you might have
[50:16] still come struggled with coming to
[50:17] church but if you used to struggle with
[50:19] church and now you're in church you
[50:21] don't struggle with that anymore amen
[50:23] amen oh when you when when something
[50:25] really gets a hold of you in your heart
[50:27] and your desire changed and you want to
[50:30] be around the people of God
[50:32] it's not a struggle to come to church
[50:34] it's not a struggle if you're struggling
[50:36] to come to church then you're working
[50:38] and you're working you're not wrestling
[50:40] if you're struggling to put away that
[50:42] cigarette if you're struggling to walk
[50:44] down the aisle in the grocery store
[50:45] without going by the wine or the liquor
[50:47] hour then you're working you're not
[50:49] resting you're not working you are but
[50:52] but a Christian is a real Christian is
[50:54] not working they are resting that's what
[50:56] after all that work that that that Ruth
[50:59] went through she she was she was going
[51:01] behind all the men that worked for Boaz
[51:03] picking up bending over at the back and
[51:06] probably had uh back trouble after the
[51:08] end of the day picking up all that
[51:09] working working working picking up the
[51:12] little gleaning gleaning the sheaves
[51:13] working working working but finally she
[51:16] found a place at boaz's feet and when
[51:18] she got it boaz's feet and he threw over
[51:21] her the covering then the her work
[51:24] ceased and what was she doing she was
[51:27] sitting there on the threshing floor
[51:28] watching Boaz get up the next morning
[51:30] and who went to work Boaz went to work
[51:33] Boaz went to work and Ruth stopped
[51:36] working because Ruth is at risk now
[51:38] that's a type of you and I we're not
[51:39] supposed to be working we're not
[51:41] supposed to be struggling in and out go
[51:43] to a camp meeting get real fire on fire
[51:45] come back to church and get real
[51:46] lackadaisical can't even hardly keep our
[51:48] eyes open during service don't really
[51:50] don't really want to be there and get
[51:52] something we can check off our check box
[51:53] oh but if your desire has changed you
[51:56] want to be oh if your desire is right
[51:59] then your worship will change your
[52:02] attitude will change your praise will
[52:04] change if your desire is right then
[52:06] you've got something to praise God about
[52:07] because and I think I think we've all
[52:10] got something that we can praise about
[52:12] God about to know that we're resting
[52:14] that we're not working that God wants us
[52:16] to rest that it's not us that is Christ
[52:18] doing it and Hebrews chapter 4 Paul says
[52:21] so then there remains of Sabbath rest
[52:24] for the people of God for whoever has
[52:26] entered God's rest has also rested from
[52:29] his works as God did from his you have
[52:32] rested from your works from struggling
[52:34] and trying to make it work and trying to
[52:37] force something if you're struggling
[52:38] this afternoon something is not right if
[52:42] you're struggling something ain't right
[52:43] now brother Brown will give an example
[52:45] of like a pipe that you know you uh if
[52:48] you've ever had water problems where you
[52:50] know
[52:51] those of us with a lot of women in the
[52:53] house the pipe gets all clogged with a
[52:55] lot of hair and you got to get it
[52:57] unstopped and if the pipe is clogged up
[52:59] it just won't work what what's happening
[53:01] to water is struggling to get water from
[53:04] one place to the other and that's the
[53:06] same thing with a lot of us in in our
[53:08] spiritual experience our flus get
[53:10] clogged up and we're struggling to get
[53:12] to get access to God and struggling and
[53:15] trying to work something up and and the
[53:17] and the pipe just think it's clogged up
[53:20] but God can remove the stroke in other
[53:23] words he can remove the clog the partial
[53:26] clog or the floor clog and open it up so
[53:29] that the Holy Spirit can run freely in
[53:31] your life now isn't that what we all
[53:33] want this afternoon that's what we come
[53:34] to church
[53:37] he said
[53:39] and questions and answers she said like
[53:41] I said to a person it's like an old stop
[53:43] took pipe and you run a little wire
[53:45] through it and you get a hold of this
[53:46] wire and you Zig Zig Zig and there's a
[53:48] great flow of water trying to get
[53:49] through Zig Zig Zig you can't get it but
[53:51] you know there's something up there you
[53:53] can feel it it's up on that end then
[53:55] after a while here give her a great big
[53:57] pull and he imitates the sound of
[54:00] Russian water goes through the pipe
[54:01] that's the way it is then the water just
[54:04] keeps on coming that's the way the holy
[54:07] spirit is sin stopped up the pipes you
[54:10] sit back and say I'm timing you know I
[54:12] couldn't say that I'm afraid that people
[54:14] think I was a Holy Roller see now when
[54:16] you feel that little tugging of the
[54:18] spirit that's God drawing you that's the
[54:21] father no man can come except the father
[54:23] draw him you feel that little tugging of
[54:25] the spirit you want it more than life it
[54:28] more than you want more than your own
[54:31] life it means more to you I got to have
[54:35] it or Die the first thing you know you
[54:39] get a hole or something like putting
[54:40] that little pot you get a hold of it you
[54:43] think that's it Lord you pull the cork
[54:45] out
[54:46] here she comes gone oh my free I don't
[54:49] care if the President Eisenhower was
[54:52] sitting there you say glory to God now
[54:54] you think about that that description
[54:56] there is the kind of Liberty and kind of
[54:59] freedom and worship kind of freedom and
[55:01] Christian life that God wants us to have
[55:03] he don't want to struggle to try to pump
[55:05] something up in the church service he
[55:07] don't want us to struggle and try to
[55:09] live a Christian Life he wants the Holy
[55:11] Spirit to have such preeminence in our
[55:13] life until it's just gushing it's just
[55:15] flowing everywhere isn't that what the
[55:17] statue of a perfect man is supposed to
[55:19] symbolize it that water just gushing out
[55:21] of the top floor what's he doing pushing
[55:23] out all the weeds and all all the trash
[55:25] and everything just flowing in you
[55:28] freely
[55:29] cause why cause you got a hold of
[55:31] something oh you gotta you answered that
[55:33] tug that's drawn at your heart and you
[55:35] responded to it when God began to began
[55:37] to call at your heart there's something
[55:39] in you that begin to respond so let's
[55:42] get up let's get up to the hilltop
[55:43] wherever that Hilltop is in your journey
[55:46] right now let's get up to the top of
[55:48] that Hilltop where it doesn't bother us
[55:51] anymore
[55:54] and why Christ speak he said I'm so glad
[55:56] that a man's can so completely serve god
[55:59] Till the devil don't know what to do
[56:03] just obey God so completely to the devil
[56:06] say oh my get away I don't want to hear
[56:09] it no more that's right and he said you
[56:12] can do it so completely yes you can do
[56:15] it you think this afternoon see that's
[56:18] what preachers are challenging that idea
[56:20] that you can't do it I can't do it but
[56:22] you can do it and God has given us the
[56:24] recipe to do it to have to have our body
[56:26] our spirit and our soul so completely in
[56:29] line with God until we're caressed and
[56:31] resting completely in the Redemptive
[56:34] promise
[56:35] and the deity of Jesus Christ he says
[56:37] now friends I know this to be the truth
[56:39] I know people don't realize who you are
[56:42] every person in here can live above sin
[56:45] can live without sin live in God you'll
[56:49] make mistakes but the blood of Christ
[56:51] will forgive you it's by his grace what
[56:54] is this I'm talking about it's a promise
[56:56] of Grace I'm talking about measures of
[56:58] Grace overcoming Grace to each one that
[57:01] I'm looking out at a congregation a lot
[57:03] of different people you all look
[57:05] different some have glasses on some have
[57:07] don't have glasses some young or olds
[57:09] different colors different backgrounds
[57:11] but this promise it is not a respecter
[57:14] of persons whoever whosoever will let
[57:17] him come This Promise This Promise of
[57:19] this kind of Grace that you can live and
[57:21] overcoming life is to you no matter what
[57:23] your background is brother I'm going to
[57:25] say in Grace God has given to us all
[57:27] freely as we have need everything that
[57:30] we have need of
[57:34] he said God doesn't respect persons he
[57:37] wants all of his children to have the
[57:39] same
[57:42] a righteous father wouldn't give up one
[57:44] a dish of ice cream without giving them
[57:46] all ice cream
[57:47] now you think you think about what that
[57:49] means if you could look around the
[57:50] building this morning and see some
[57:51] living like that like what he quoted
[57:54] earlier in this message some living
[57:56] without a struggle that means you can
[57:58] live without a struggle too oh if oh if
[58:01] you could really grasp that I that's a
[58:04] promise to run after if you congrat if
[58:06] somebody's getting a blessing then you
[58:08] can get a blessing too if somebody's
[58:10] receiving healing in their body then you
[58:12] can receive it too
[58:14] Grace that's God's Gift of grace to you
[58:17] that he's not going to give it just to
[58:19] one without giving that same opportunity
[58:22] to everybody God God is not a respecter
[58:25] of persons
[58:27] brother I will say did you know that
[58:29] that little cherry tree or a little
[58:30] apple tree when you set it out when it's
[58:32] no bigger than about one half inch tall
[58:34] that every bushel of apples that you'll
[58:35] ever collect off that tree is in it
[58:37] right then the only thing that that
[58:39] little tree does you just set it out and
[58:41] water it and it has to drink and drink
[58:44] until it gets so much it just goes to
[58:46] pushing up drinks more than a slotted
[58:48] portion and it swells out and it pushes
[58:51] out limbs it pushes out buds it just
[58:53] keeps drinking drink and drink until it
[58:56] just pushes out and that's what the
[58:58] Christian does it's all drinking resting
[59:01] peace it's not what you struggle and
[59:04] strive and pull at you defeat the very
[59:07] purpose that you're representing when
[59:09] you do that when you struggle and strive
[59:11] it's just rest oh to think that you can
[59:13] be like that tree that David talked
[59:15] about a tree planted by the rivers and
[59:17] water that all you do is just guzzle up
[59:18] as much water as you can and the more
[59:20] water you can guzzle up the more you
[59:22] push out and push out until you're
[59:24] pushing out fruit until you're pushing
[59:26] out a life that everybody can see on
[59:28] display and that's what a real Christian
[59:30] does now it don't matter it doesn't
[59:32] matter what kind of background you got
[59:34] it doesn't matter if you're a minister
[59:35] it doesn't matter if you're a house by
[59:37] housewife God is no respecter of persons
[59:40] that Grace is for all
[59:43] God's not one you have to beg and cry
[59:46] and plead and fast and starve and
[59:47] everything like that to get you I thank
[59:49] God it's not by all works to think that
[59:51] if it was by works that we'd have to get
[59:52] our little Rosary board out or something
[59:54] all the little beads out and tick
[59:56] through them and and do something until
[59:57] until the like a priest was satisfied
[1:00:01] what if it was by prayer what if it was
[1:00:04] by fasting and you had to fast a certain
[1:00:06] amount of times or a certain number of
[1:00:07] hours every week to be acceptable to God
[1:00:09] but God's not he's saying God ain't like
[1:00:11] that he's not one you've got to beg and
[1:00:13] cry and plead and fast and starve and
[1:00:15] everything like that to get to Now flip
[1:00:17] it around that don't mean we don't
[1:00:18] believe in praying and fasting we just
[1:00:20] don't believe in doing it from the work
[1:00:22] single but we believe by faith by faith
[1:00:24] you you pray and you fast and you do
[1:00:26] things because God is drawing you if God
[1:00:29] calls you to fast then fast if God many
[1:00:32] times God will call will call a minister
[1:00:34] to fast many many of us ministers know
[1:00:36] about you know you just suddenly you
[1:00:38] just lose your appetite and you're just
[1:00:40] I'm just not going to eat and it's not
[1:00:41] because you're hungry it's not because
[1:00:43] you're trying to work something up it's
[1:00:44] just because you're you're you you're
[1:00:46] preparing a sermon and God just calls
[1:00:48] you to fast in that moment if God calls
[1:00:50] you to pray pray if God is pulling at
[1:00:52] your heart to pray pray but you're not
[1:00:54] praying because you're trying to work
[1:00:55] something up you're praying because you
[1:00:56] want to enter into communion with God
[1:00:58] and God is drawing you God is pulling
[1:01:01] you God will call you to it you don't
[1:01:03] call yourself God will call you you
[1:01:05] don't do things by work it's by Grace
[1:01:07] but if God calls you you better go oh
[1:01:11] listen now if God is calling you to pray
[1:01:13] to a better a greater prayer life then
[1:01:15] you better pray if God is calling you to
[1:01:18] fast then you better fast you better
[1:01:21] respond if God is calling you to give up
[1:01:23] your life to give your life to him and
[1:01:26] so that he can take take feel you and
[1:01:28] and use you and do something with your
[1:01:30] life you'd better respond because if you
[1:01:33] don't what happens you're you're so he
[1:01:34] said your soul begins to draw just kind
[1:01:36] of pull back and it's that that thing
[1:01:39] that God gave you Desiring something
[1:01:41] thirsting for something begins to draw
[1:01:42] back you're grieving away the Holy
[1:01:44] Spirit your soul begins to drop down
[1:01:46] until you want you won't realize the
[1:01:48] state you're in until you're on your
[1:01:50] deathbed like this little sister that he
[1:01:52] was preaching about this little young
[1:01:53] lady when they're on her deathbed her
[1:01:55] soul come up and she realized that she
[1:01:57] was lost
[1:01:59] laughs
[1:02:00] if God is calling to your you to respond
[1:02:03] respond is God calling you to an
[1:02:05] overcoming life now you think about
[1:02:07] those old Egyptian task Masters had
[1:02:09] drove the people to do things that they
[1:02:10] were burdened to do and after they look
[1:02:13] back in the Red Sea they found them
[1:02:15] every one around there
[1:02:17] you think you know a man never knows
[1:02:19] what it is to live a Victorious life
[1:02:21] until he's completely overcome when you
[1:02:24] realize that you look back and you ain't
[1:02:25] struggling anymore that's why that's why
[1:02:27] Miriam when they got over on the other
[1:02:29] side she could take up that tambourine
[1:02:31] and sing a new song Praise after the
[1:02:33] battle she began to praise that's why
[1:02:35] after the walls fell down that Rahab on
[1:02:37] the wall with that sinful background she
[1:02:39] looked to God's promise and she after
[1:02:41] the walls came down she married into the
[1:02:43] into Judah and what's what's the banner
[1:02:45] of Judah the banner of Judah is praise
[1:02:47] oh she got her praise on then when she
[1:02:50] began to realize what God had done she
[1:02:52] married into the house of Praise when
[1:02:54] she saw the walls coming down all her
[1:02:56] past was erased all her sin was gone
[1:02:58] that's when you realize that you've
[1:03:01] truly overcome
[1:03:02] and Christ has equipped you to overcome
[1:03:05] and let me ask you let's just stop a
[1:03:07] little bit
[1:03:10] I'm trying to teach this afternoon and
[1:03:11] not preach so much
[1:03:13] what what are you what are you really
[1:03:14] overcoming like brother Louise was
[1:03:16] preaching on this morning you're
[1:03:18] overcoming yourself yeah yeah and I see
[1:03:20] that's what we we get called up so many
[1:03:22] times as like brother Louise was I'm
[1:03:24] riffing on brother Louise this morning
[1:03:25] off of that sermon that he was we so
[1:03:28] many times we get caught up in what
[1:03:30] other people are doing you know I I was
[1:03:32] sitting we went out to eat with um
[1:03:34] uh I'm gonna say the brother's name we
[1:03:37] don't have to eat with brother Marcus
[1:03:38] Becker a while back and one thing he
[1:03:40] really said just kind of stuck with me
[1:03:41] he said if you can if you can understand
[1:03:43] yourself
[1:03:45] it's about understanding yourself
[1:03:47] it's not about understanding other
[1:03:49] people because you're trying to overcome
[1:03:51] yourself so that's what we're trying to
[1:03:53] when we come to church and we look into
[1:03:55] the mirror of God's word we're trying to
[1:03:56] over understand our problems and and
[1:04:00] that's that's what the devil does he'll
[1:04:01] put a veil over your eye where you don't
[1:04:03] even realize your own problems
[1:04:05] exactly what brother Louise was saying
[1:04:07] this morning that when you if you're a
[1:04:09] cheater or or a liar or you know all the
[1:04:13] things that we could list out the devil
[1:04:15] will cover your eyes over so you don't
[1:04:17] even realize that you're prideful that
[1:04:19] you've got enmity and but the word The
[1:04:21] Goth that's what the gospel does is it
[1:04:23] it takes that takes that Veil away from
[1:04:26] your eyes just like the grease that
[1:04:28] brother Ram's Mama used to put over his
[1:04:30] eyes so that he could see in the morning
[1:04:32] it takes the it opens up your eyes so
[1:04:35] that you can really see your what what
[1:04:38] we really see need to see is that the
[1:04:40] biggest enemy that we have is ourselves
[1:04:42] it's not the person sitting next to us
[1:04:45] on the Pew it's not the minister behind
[1:04:47] the pulpit uh the biggest enemy we have
[1:04:49] is ourself and Christ has equipped us to
[1:04:52] overcome ourselves to overcome what your
[1:04:55] reasoning and your pride and your temper
[1:04:58] and your impatience and your lust and
[1:05:02] all those things that Paul might have
[1:05:04] listed out in the Bible
[1:05:06] okay that's why in Revelation 11 15 when
[1:05:09] the seventh trumpet sounded there were
[1:05:11] great voices in heaven that said the
[1:05:13] kingdoms of this world have become the
[1:05:14] kingdoms of Our Lord so that's what
[1:05:17] that's what the gospel is doing that's
[1:05:18] what God is doing is he's taken all
[1:05:20] these little kingdoms that we have in
[1:05:21] our life of our pride and our temper and
[1:05:24] all these things and he's tearing them
[1:05:25] down until he takes over what's he's
[1:05:27] taking things over yes it's a takeover
[1:05:30] it's a gospel takeover that God has
[1:05:32] taken over your life until there's
[1:05:34] nothing left but like you read in the
[1:05:36] Book of Revelation where it says it says
[1:05:38] the books were opened and the Deeds were
[1:05:40] read and they were judged the the
[1:05:42] foolish virgin and all the ones the
[1:05:44] Sinners that came to the throne and
[1:05:46] they're judged by the deeds in their
[1:05:47] life but you that that's written in the
[1:05:50] name in the Lamb's Book of Life there's
[1:05:51] nothing written about you but your name
[1:05:53] your name there's no Deeds there's no
[1:05:56] Deeds because these have been wiped away
[1:05:57] there's nothing left but you can
[1:05:59] identify Yourself by you looking there
[1:06:01] and the book is open and there's a name
[1:06:03] Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and so forth
[1:06:06] and so on and you your name's written
[1:06:07] down but no Deeds only your names are
[1:06:10] written down because your your life has
[1:06:12] been taken over by God
[1:06:14] I want to think that one day all this
[1:06:16] sinful life will be completely left
[1:06:18] behind it will be completely overcome
[1:06:21] you know that the very first miracle
[1:06:23] that Jesus ever did was a testament to
[1:06:26] that
[1:06:27] when he went and ended that marriage of
[1:06:29] Cana and he he he he uh changed the
[1:06:32] water into wine brother Brown said he
[1:06:34] proved in his first miracle turning
[1:06:36] water to wine and so forth showing he
[1:06:38] bypassed the vine he just spoke from
[1:06:40] Water to Wine God just spoke it and
[1:06:43] bypassed all that it would have went
[1:06:45] from wine up through the grapevine and
[1:06:47] then ferment and ferment and a vat and
[1:06:48] turned into wine but God just spoke it
[1:06:50] and bypassed all that so will he in the
[1:06:53] resurrection of all the sexuals and
[1:06:56] marriage and things it'll all be done
[1:06:58] away with God will just speak and will
[1:07:01] live again God will just speak speak
[1:07:04] what you'll hear the word and your body
[1:07:05] will be changed oh to think that your
[1:07:08] body won't have to be born again you
[1:07:10] won't have to take this body and put it
[1:07:11] back through through an incubation put
[1:07:13] it back through come forth from a
[1:07:15] natural birth but God will just take it
[1:07:17] skip all that process skip it and just
[1:07:20] change your body
[1:07:21] Hallelujah
[1:07:24] I'm trying to get to this little story
[1:07:28] he's talking about this little woman
[1:07:29] that was laying there in the hospital
[1:07:30] and I'm going to be closing here in just
[1:07:32] a minute he said there was a woman who
[1:07:35] belonged to a very prominent
[1:07:36] denominational Church to live close
[1:07:39] we always doubted her experience
[1:07:45] so if brother Branham doubted somebody's
[1:07:47] experience
[1:07:48] I'll take that as a right when I look
[1:07:51] and see people not coming to church and
[1:07:53] not living right I doubt their
[1:07:55] experience he said we always doubted her
[1:07:58] experience I'm sorry but that's just the
[1:07:59] way it is you you look and see people
[1:08:02] that that they're Desiring right they're
[1:08:04] not living right and brother Randall
[1:08:06] said and we're you're not doing it out
[1:08:08] of a place of judgment but you're doing
[1:08:10] a place of concern people are concerned
[1:08:13] we're concerned about one another he
[1:08:15] said she just reasoned that she was
[1:08:16] right she moved to a new church and
[1:08:19] noticed the neighbor girls wearing
[1:08:20] disgraceful clothes and she said the
[1:08:23] other girls do it so can I
[1:08:25] the other girls do it he said her faith
[1:08:28] and God was intellectual it was
[1:08:31] reasoning your mind will reason but your
[1:08:34] heart don't reason he said the very soul
[1:08:36] that was telling her it was wrong it was
[1:08:39] she was grieving it away because she
[1:08:41] kept saying they smoked cigarettes so
[1:08:42] why can't why can't she smoke see that's
[1:08:45] out the devil the Trap Of The Devil you
[1:08:46] start looking at other people you start
[1:08:48] looking at the world
[1:08:49] young people you start looking at your
[1:08:51] friends and you start getting off the
[1:08:53] path because you start thinking your mom
[1:08:54] and daddy don't know they don't know
[1:08:56] what they're talking about and I what it
[1:08:59] is that the devil will put on you a
[1:09:01] spirit where you just want to be popular
[1:09:03] and you want to be accepted oh but
[1:09:06] ought to get in God and then you can
[1:09:07] have rest and be accepted be a part of
[1:09:10] be part of uh able to live a holy clean
[1:09:14] life what a blessing to be able to live
[1:09:17] a clean life where you're not burdened
[1:09:19] down by all the things that a devil the
[1:09:22] devil will put on you
[1:09:24] and he said a little Slicker moved in
[1:09:26] the neighborhood with his hair slicked
[1:09:27] down and every night before they go to
[1:09:30] bed she'd slip out to take the things
[1:09:31] out the backyard and he'd kiss her good
[1:09:34] night across the fence and the first
[1:09:36] thing you know she left John her husband
[1:09:38] and married this guy
[1:09:39] the very soul that was telling her it
[1:09:42] was wrong she was grieving it away
[1:09:44] oh see when your soul was echoed
[1:09:46] something down on the inside I shouldn't
[1:09:48] do this oh that's that's what I was
[1:09:50] talking about this morning listen listen
[1:09:51] to that little still small voice
[1:09:54] listen to that little sometimes you know
[1:09:55] sometimes it's a real quiet voice
[1:10:00] I'll tell you I'll tell you a good
[1:10:02] example
[1:10:03] we went we went to the church there in
[1:10:05] South Carolina and I went out in the
[1:10:06] parking lot to get something out of the
[1:10:08] car
[1:10:09] and uh and I I was going to reach for
[1:10:12] the door handle and I just felt
[1:10:14] impressed if you touched that door
[1:10:16] handle the alarm is going to go off
[1:10:19] and I thought that's strange I'm gonna
[1:10:23] do it anyway
[1:10:25] and I opened the door
[1:10:30] Now isn't that how the same thing in the
[1:10:32] spiritual now if you if if you just
[1:10:34] listen to that voice it'll get you out
[1:10:36] of trouble that little boy says telling
[1:10:39] you you better not do that you're going
[1:10:42] to get in trouble now I got myself in
[1:10:44] trouble because I didn't have the keys
[1:10:45] my wife had the key the key fob so I was
[1:10:47] standing out there and that thing was
[1:10:48] hop on I had to go run back in church
[1:10:51] worry about you know ever what everybody
[1:10:54] would say me going back in and out and
[1:10:56] getting the key from my wife if you
[1:10:59] listen to that little voice then it'll
[1:11:00] save you a lot of trouble just listen to
[1:11:03] that little impression you you need to
[1:11:04] apologize to that brother you shouldn't
[1:11:07] have done that don't go there your
[1:11:09] friend will invite you to go to some
[1:11:11] some sleepover at their house or
[1:11:13] something like that and you you've got
[1:11:15] that little tub or maybe the parents you
[1:11:17] gotta look you better you better be
[1:11:18] careful about that better not do that
[1:11:20] you better listen to those little things
[1:11:21] like that pay heed to it
[1:11:24] that's one thing I've learned as as the
[1:11:26] years go by a lot of times you know you
[1:11:28] don't quite have confidence in that
[1:11:30] voice like maybe that's just me but as
[1:11:33] the years go by you had more and more
[1:11:35] confidence in that still Small Voice
[1:11:37] that you need to take heed to it
[1:11:41] I wish I would have listened to it
[1:11:42] before I opened that door
[1:11:46] and he said when you say oh he says
[1:11:48] smoking cigarettes and drinking and
[1:11:50] carousing and running around is the very
[1:11:52] symptoms of seeing it's the attributes
[1:11:54] of your unbelief and you do those things
[1:11:56] because you don't believe Jesus it all
[1:11:59] goes back to Faith the reason that you
[1:12:02] don't there is the reason that you do
[1:12:04] those things is because you you don't
[1:12:06] believe
[1:12:07] when you say you're a Believer and do do
[1:12:10] that it shows there's something wrong
[1:12:15] you don't believe
[1:12:16] you're making out like you believe
[1:12:20] oh you see why the fruits show what's
[1:12:22] really there yes when you when you don't
[1:12:24] you know the saying uh if it walks like
[1:12:27] a duck and acts like a duck it's a duck
[1:12:30] well if it looks like a Christian if it
[1:12:32] looks like an antichristian
[1:12:37] thank you brother
[1:12:40] he said you're talking taking reasonings
[1:12:42] and not taking your Soul's conviction
[1:12:44] because your soul is the part of God
[1:12:46] that's in you that'll agree with God's
[1:12:49] word being true
[1:12:50] if not you'll just take our intellectual
[1:12:53] Now isn't that you it's going to take
[1:12:55] more more than intellectual I was like
[1:12:57] looking online I showed you all those
[1:12:59] artificial intelligence drawings that in
[1:13:01] my Sunday school lesson this morning
[1:13:02] artificial intelligence is getting it's
[1:13:05] it's really taken off if you're not
[1:13:07] paying attention to the news and
[1:13:08] recently there was the first very first
[1:13:10] artificially intelligent AI generated
[1:13:13] church service my point is it's going to
[1:13:16] take more than intellectual and if you
[1:13:18] go out to one of these AI tools online
[1:13:20] you can ask it a question and it will
[1:13:22] spit back a very good biblically sound
[1:13:25] answer I I mean like like you're talking
[1:13:29] to somebody that knows what they're
[1:13:30] talking about with scriptural references
[1:13:32] and tying things together in the Bible
[1:13:34] and it'll spit back as many paragraphs
[1:13:36] as you want and it's it's very Advanced
[1:13:39] now what they've done over there in
[1:13:41] England they had a a church service
[1:13:43] where they used this to to just generate
[1:13:45] a church service and then they had a
[1:13:47] artificial intelligence like a a a a
[1:13:50] fake person up on the screen delivering
[1:13:53] a sermon and all those people were
[1:13:55] listening to a sermon delivered by a
[1:13:57] computer now you see that's why it's
[1:13:59] going to take more than intellectual
[1:14:00] it's good it's got to take it's got to
[1:14:03] take the spirit it's The Spirit Well
[1:14:05] they what they said when they were
[1:14:06] listening to that they said it was
[1:14:07] lacking hard it was lacking some kind of
[1:14:09] something real because it was spitting
[1:14:11] out just reams of text but there was
[1:14:13] something lacking it's it's got to take
[1:14:16] it's got to take something more than
[1:14:18] intellectual to make this message live
[1:14:20] it's got to be lived it's got to be it's
[1:14:23] got to be a life on display where it's
[1:14:25] walking and talking and God God is using
[1:14:28] your life and using your lips and using
[1:14:30] your feet using your your body not
[1:14:32] something that you can just read off of
[1:14:34] the page and say how much you know
[1:14:36] and brother Brown will say of course see
[1:14:38] see this that's what this woman's
[1:14:40] problem was she was looking at it from
[1:14:42] an intellectual perspective thinking
[1:14:44] well I I like the Bible uh and and the
[1:14:48] Devils was the devil in the old in the
[1:14:50] New Testament said they they they uh you
[1:14:53] know knew who Jesus was and they uh said
[1:14:56] Thou Art the Son of God and all those
[1:14:57] kind of things it's got to be more than
[1:14:59] just intellectual brother Adam said of
[1:15:01] course with that little Slicker she
[1:15:03] ought to have had brains enough to know
[1:15:04] if he would run away from one right one
[1:15:06] Rife one wife he would do another one so
[1:15:09] that's what he done
[1:15:10] she'd say I belong to church my letter
[1:15:13] is in the church I'm just as good as
[1:15:16] anybody I said I'm as good as you are
[1:15:19] your soul will always testify to the
[1:15:21] word of God if it's born again
[1:15:24] she thought she was right
[1:15:26] now see what the I know y'all getting
[1:15:28] tired y'all hang on with me just a
[1:15:30] little bit
[1:15:33] I'm battling it out but I got a message
[1:15:36] delivering so hang with me just a few
[1:15:38] more minutes
[1:15:41] that's what the devil will do is he'll
[1:15:42] he'll he'll make you think that you're
[1:15:44] right when you're not right
[1:15:47] that's the trick of the devil to cloak
[1:15:49] you over and make you think you're right
[1:15:51] when you're not
[1:15:53] and brothers will say he said you say
[1:15:55] well I know I believe I'm right you
[1:15:57] think you're right because of an
[1:15:58] intellectual understanding where you
[1:16:00] just look at you you like being at
[1:16:02] church you like but there's something
[1:16:03] you're still struggling there's not
[1:16:06] supposed to be any struggle I I was
[1:16:08] really I was looking at that quote of
[1:16:10] Muhammad Ali where he said I don't
[1:16:11] always know what I'm talking about but I
[1:16:13] know I'm right now what a strange thing
[1:16:15] for somebody to say
[1:16:17] I don't always know what I'm talking
[1:16:19] about but I know I'm right and that's
[1:16:20] the trick that the the Trap that the
[1:16:22] devil puts on people to say I I don't
[1:16:25] know what I'm talking about but I know
[1:16:26] I'm right what a strange thing for
[1:16:28] somebody to say
[1:16:30] I don't know what I'm talking about but
[1:16:31] I know I'm right
[1:16:35] but it doesn't make sense but that's how
[1:16:38] that's how you'll see people that are
[1:16:40] trapped in sin I don't know how to get
[1:16:43] out I don't know I don't know
[1:16:45] but I don't know but I know I'm right
[1:16:48] I I know I'm right
[1:16:51] brother and would say today people say
[1:16:53] oh that was in the day pass he said the
[1:16:56] first thing you know your soul will go
[1:16:57] away from you will become so culturized
[1:17:00] out there with the rest of the Cults and
[1:17:01] things T you'll think you're right
[1:17:04] till you think you're right until death
[1:17:07] stares you in the face and it'll be a
[1:17:10] different picture
[1:17:11] but when your experience agrees with
[1:17:14] this Bible and says every word is true
[1:17:17] I wonder this afternoon as we're as
[1:17:20] we're closing in just a moment can you
[1:17:22] can you identify your experience with
[1:17:25] the Wilderness Journey can you identify
[1:17:27] your experience with with the all these
[1:17:31] things that we're talking about Street
[1:17:32] three stages of the journey going
[1:17:34] through justification and sanctification
[1:17:37] and baptism of the Holy Ghost because if
[1:17:40] you can identify your experience
[1:17:43] maybe the experience didn't happen
[1:17:47] I'm trying to find a place to close here
[1:17:50] he said the man that lives in there in
[1:17:52] that holy of holies has always got the
[1:17:54] victory yes he's in the presence of God
[1:17:57] he's always got a victory
[1:17:59] always got victory
[1:18:02] a man that ever fully surrenders his
[1:18:04] heart and life
[1:18:06] man woman boy or girl who dares to take
[1:18:08] God at his word and says God sanely I
[1:18:11] come to you and give me the new birth in
[1:18:14] My Heart Lord
[1:18:15] stand there under the bloody cross and
[1:18:17] believe it with all your heart something
[1:18:20] will come to you brother
[1:18:21] that God will shut you away and the
[1:18:24] world will become dead and all the
[1:18:26] things that pertain to the world will be
[1:18:28] dead now to think about that promise as
[1:18:30] we're closing here the musicians can go
[1:18:32] ahead and come forward
[1:18:33] to think that he would say if you just
[1:18:35] look look at the promise of God sanely
[1:18:38] maybe maybe this afternoon you've got a
[1:18:40] lot of struggles in your life struggles
[1:18:42] that you want God to take away struggles
[1:18:44] that you want God to be able to handle
[1:18:47] that you want to just put all of it over
[1:18:49] on him that that there's a promise that
[1:18:52] brother Adam said if God if you say God
[1:18:54] sanely I come to you and give me the new
[1:18:57] birth in my heart and stand there under
[1:19:00] the bloody cross and believe it with all
[1:19:02] your heart
[1:19:03] something will come to you brother
[1:19:06] oh to think about you know you're coming
[1:19:08] to church it's just like just like at a
[1:19:10] wedding
[1:19:11] where you're coming to church and The
[1:19:13] Minister's at the pulpit

[1:19:19] you just say I do the minister is
