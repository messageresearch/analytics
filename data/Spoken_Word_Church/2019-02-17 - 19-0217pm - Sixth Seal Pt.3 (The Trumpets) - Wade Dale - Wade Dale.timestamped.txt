[13:16] because you will be here for a second
[13:20] sister Gayle you laugh but you really
[13:22] have self so be March the third so to be
[13:27] the third of March all right let's get
[13:31] started revelation 6 verse 12
[13:40] really remember brother Cody's family at
[13:46] brother Dutchess that was that was rough
[13:48] the little brother just went in with
[13:50] blood clots in his leg and and he passed
[13:54] away because one of them moved and went
[13:56] into his heart or his brain one and took
[13:59] him for those of y'all that did not know
[14:15] it I think we already announced it but
[14:17] it's been a month or so ago the city of
[14:18] Lula never wanted to sell that property
[14:22] because of the well-being there used to
[14:24] be that used to be the city well little
[14:26] years ago and they cut it off and
[14:29] they're using well somewhere else we
[14:31] anyway they didn't want to ever sell
[14:32] this well they come up the other day and
[14:34] just wanted to get rid of some property
[14:36] so they gave us half of this property
[14:40] the grass park because we never owned
[14:42] that we just don't really right up to
[14:44] where that where our awning is so we got
[14:47] now to where the basketball court is and
[14:49] brother Buster and them they gave them
[14:51] the other half of that light so we own
[14:53] the tool there's no blood in between us
[14:55] anymore we own that part the church does
[14:57] and this little white building right
[14:59] here and bustering them owns from there
[15:02] up to about where that basketball goal
[15:05] is so and the city of Lille gave it to
[15:08] us I hope the city of Lula gets a
[15:10] blessing from that man let's give them a
[15:12] hint we just had to pay for the church
[15:16] paid for the closing cost which was
[15:18] several hundred dollars but still we got
[15:20] property 400 dollars he pitched in for
[15:23] and we pitched in for and the land now
[15:26] is ours so we can pave it so we could
[15:29] don't have mud everywhere we can pave
[15:30] that part and and be able to accommodate
[15:34] a few more cars so thank God for that
[15:36] they just come up one day and I read in
[15:38] the paper and they said they were just
[15:39] gonna give us the land so that's great
[15:44] yeah that we being a City Councilmember
[15:48] I know what today you you can abandon
[15:49] property in other words they didn't want
[15:51] to
[15:51] maintain it so latest ones they just
[15:54] said well since you're attached to it
[15:55] we'll give it half to you in half to
[15:57] them so so that's what's going on there
[16:00] so just think if you ever seen anybody
[16:02] do Loula just thinking because they gave
[16:05] it to us they didn't have to they were
[16:08] gracious enough all these 50 years to
[16:10] let us use it as parking but now we own
[16:13] it so we can pave it and we can you know
[16:16] do some things so so just keep that in
[16:18] you in your heart in your prayer
[16:19] revelation 6 verse 12 this print the
[16:23] only father thank you for this day that
[16:24] we have here to serve you set aside just

[17:57] tomorrow's Presidents Day if you didn't
[17:59] know that the government gives me time
[18:02] off on on Presidents Day
[18:04] so revelation 6 verse 12 and I beheld we
[18:07] had opened the sixth seal and lo there
[18:08] was a great earthquake the Sun became
[18:10] black as sackcloth of hair and the moon
[18:13] became as blood and the stars of heaven
[18:15] fell unto the earth even as a fig tree
[18:16] casteth this untimely figs when she is
[18:19] shaken of a mighty wind and the heaven
[18:21] departed as a scroll when it was rolled
[18:22] together and every mountain and Island
[18:24] were moved out of their places all this
[18:27] has got something to do with nature all
[18:29] right and the kings of the earth and the
[18:30] great men and the rich men and the chief
[18:32] captains the mighty men and every
[18:33] bondman and every free man hid himself
[18:35] themselves in dens and in the rocks of
[18:37] the mountains and said to the mountains
[18:39] and rocks fall on us and hide us from
[18:40] the face of him that sitteth on the
[18:42] throne that ones sitting on the throne
[18:44] and from the wrath of the lamb for the
[18:46] great day of his wrath is come and who
[18:48] shall be able to stand you may be seated
[18:50] in Lord as my singing this morning my
[18:53] brother Dale let me just Adam just let
[18:55] you think about something you know if
[18:57] it's pouring down rain and thunder and
[18:58] lightning you don't want to be on the
[19:00] building you want to be in the building
[19:04] and that's what he's talking about with
[19:06] this throne you don't want to be on the
[19:08] throne things can happen but once you're
[19:10] in the throne you're protected by
[19:12] whatever sitting there on that throne
[19:13] man so you're protected you're not on
[19:16] you're in you're in this building and we
[19:18] have the protection of this building so
[19:19] I don't want to be I don't want to be
[19:22] found on Christ the Bible says in Christ
[19:24] amen I want to be found in him having
[19:28] not my own righteousness so here we are
[19:30] with this sixth seal we're talking last
[19:32] Sunday about the two prophets and the
[19:34] two prophets I've seen about this
[19:36] yesterday you know we look at the two
[19:39] prophets and we know that it is the it's
[19:41] the Ministry of Moses and Elijah right
[19:43] amen so so we can see now that even like
[19:47] brother Branham said that that wants to
[19:50] seal open that it became a brand-new
[19:52] book and then you could take the seals
[19:54] all the way back into the Bible and
[19:56] Easter you can go all the way back into
[19:57] Genesis with the seals amen
[20:00] so we look and see that who was in the
[20:02] book of Genesis was Abraham Abraham and
[20:06] all those coming down through as what
[20:08] type different types then you see you go
[20:11] on in a little bit further in the Bible
[20:13] and you see a man named Elijah come in
[20:16] then you see the man called
[20:18] moisés there before elijah we see all
[20:20] that coming in and Leviticus said
[20:21] because it's down to Samuel and into the
[20:23] Kings and we see these people there I
[20:28] don't want to say this I'm trying to say
[20:31] it the way I thought it but you know the
[20:34] seal didn't open in the Old Testament we
[20:36] know that but a precursor to that did
[20:39] open because there stands Moses Moses
[20:42] does all this right here turns from now
[20:45] to blood and does all these things then
[20:47] a man called the Elijah comes on the
[20:48] scene he stands on the scene in the Old
[20:50] Testament and he's calling no rain for
[20:53] three and a half years he's calling all
[20:55] these different plagues Moses so the
[20:57] sixth seal is not something I don't want
[21:00] any of the seals to be something I
[21:02] wanted to be theirs it is mysterious and
[21:05] it is but it's happened all the way down
[21:07] through the time through the Bible the
[21:09] seals are all the way from Genesis all
[21:11] the way to the Book of Revelations you
[21:13] see parts of the seal maybe not the part
[21:16] that's open because see we don't we
[21:18] don't even see the opening of the sixth
[21:20] seal in its natural state because we're
[21:23] not here when the two prophets or doing
[21:26] their doing their job right so but we
[21:28] must see it open in our form the form we
[21:32] can see it so we look back in the Old
[21:34] Testament that thrilled me because then
[21:37] then what you do is you just you don't
[21:39] you're not so narrow minded and say well
[21:40] they just all happen in the book of
[21:41] Revelation no it didn't just happen in
[21:44] the book of revelations it was spoken
[21:46] all the way down even when Cain slew
[21:48] Abel because of his doctrine there was a
[21:52] doctrinal issue back in the book of
[21:54] Genesis the very first chapter one two
[21:56] and three four down in there there was a
[21:58] doctrinal issue that they killed over
[22:01] amen
[22:03] so we see the seals then all the way
[22:05] down through time coming all the way
[22:06] through even into the church ages we see
[22:08] little pieces of it but the very opening
[22:11] of that sixth seal is going to be when
[22:13] we leave here we're going out of here
[22:15] and then it's gonna that's when it's
[22:17] going to happen the two prophets the two
[22:19] prophets I I don't see how that they can
[22:21] begin preaching until we leave because
[22:25] they are to the Jews only they have
[22:26] nothing to do with us we are it is
[22:28] totally as brother Branham says you know
[22:31] see the bride anywhere in this it's just
[22:34] to Israel all right the two prophets are
[22:37] not Gentile prophets they're Jewish
[22:41] prophets
[22:42] remember they won't take I you send
[22:44] whoever you want to over there Israel
[22:47] will only believe their people
[22:52] especially when you're trying to convert
[22:56] 144,000 staunch Jews that are over there
[23:01] now I mean they're there now if we think
[23:04] and we know we don't think we know the
[23:06] end is not too far away even if it's ten
[23:10] years from now that the people everyone
[23:13] I was thinking about this every actor in
[23:15] the play is on the stage we're not
[23:18] waiting for Jesus to be born you
[23:22] understand what I'm saying
[23:23] we're not waiting for the two witnesses
[23:25] to get born naturally born they're here
[23:29] they're somewhere over there and they're
[23:32] waiting they may be just walking through
[23:36] life doing their job building this
[23:37] building that building car doing
[23:39] whatever and then all of a sudden when
[23:42] we leave that anointing is going to
[23:44] strike them amen so what is this whole
[23:48] sixth seal waiting on to open its wait
[23:50] know me and you to get out of here a man
[23:52] is waiting on us to leave here get the
[23:56] supernatural part of that seal get the
[23:58] Thunder cuz see they don't get the
[24:00] Thunder we get the Thunder their thunder
[24:06] or their opening of the seal is what
[24:08] that that part of that is the opening of
[24:10] that seal brother I'm finished those two
[24:12] prophets so there's not a mystery when
[24:15] they come forth they're already in the
[24:18] Bible tells you exactly how long they're
[24:20] gonna preach 1260 days no more no less
[24:25] tells you who they are the two witnesses
[24:28] ministry of Moses and Ministry of Elijah
[24:31] and it will be verified and vindicated
[24:35] all right I you know I I did a few years
[24:40] ago preached on the cup of Elijah and
[24:44] they
[24:44] Trucy there they go back in need it's
[24:47] kind of odd
[24:48] they take Malachi the Jews take Malachi
[24:53] for but not the way we have it the Jews
[24:58] day Malachi 4 is Elijah's got to show up
[25:00] before the Great and dreadful dreadful
[25:02] day of the Lord that's what the Bible
[25:05] says
[25:05] well that's Old Testaments that you got
[25:07] to remember the Jews over there don't
[25:10] use the New Testament so they may study
[25:12] it and first one thing another but
[25:14] that's to them it's not a book it's the
[25:17] Old Testament so you got to go into the
[25:18] Old Testament see them up works for
[25:20] Moses and Elijah then come up to Malachi
[25:22] and says in the days the divorce I mean
[25:25] nothing that he's divorce that's more
[25:26] that's revelation but it says behold I
[25:29] will send you Elijah the Prophet before
[25:30] the Great and dreadful day of the Lord
[25:32] will they're waiting on that Elijah amen
[25:38] our eyes have been open to know who that
[25:41] Elijah is they missed number four all
[25:45] right but they're getting number five
[25:47] which is going to be the same ministry
[25:49] continued on same message same ministry
[25:53] continued on into the next Elijah but
[25:55] they're looking for Elijah to come they
[25:58] have five cups
[26:01] it's cursed range the five comings of
[26:04] Elijah Elijah Elijah join the Baptist
[26:08] brother Branham and the one going to
[26:11] Israel that's five they have five cups
[26:14] of Elijah in their ceremony in Israel so
[26:18] see they're so close though that they
[26:22] missed that Malachi though Malachi 4 we
[26:25] get that we're gone that one takes us
[26:28] away before the great and dreadful day
[26:30] of the Lord and then you got to go over
[26:32] though and see then they got to start
[26:34] the tomb you know what the two prophets
[26:35] are going to do they're going to turn
[26:36] them from that Old Testament thought
[26:39] that's why God had to take you and
[26:42] change your thought from that old way to
[26:46] the new way so he's going to take that
[26:48] those two prophets they're not gonna
[26:49] walk in there start quoting Galatians
[26:51] and Ephesians and they're gonna go just
[26:56] like
[26:57] Paul did Paul went into the Old
[27:00] Testament brought Jesus Christ right out
[27:03] of the Old Testament and gave it to the
[27:05] Gentiles well what's an Elijah gonna do
[27:07] to the Jews he's going to go in that Old
[27:09] Testament remember what is it in
[27:11] Zechariah or wherever we read not too
[27:13] long ago where it says where did you get
[27:14] those scars they'll take them right to
[27:17] that scripture they'll take them to
[27:19] Malachi 4 and say look you missed that
[27:21] one I believe they do have a ministry
[27:24] but I believe they do know that brother
[27:26] Branham came I do believe that God's
[27:28] gonna have to reveal them to them that
[27:32] brother Branham has already come and
[27:33] preached his part because you got to
[27:36] deal with Malachi 4 when he deals with
[27:39] Micah for them two prophets are gonna
[27:41] say look John the John the Revelator
[27:43] spoke of us whether you believe it or
[27:45] not he spoke of us coming and there is
[27:48] even two olive trees spoke of in the Old
[27:51] Testament alright cuz this is what it
[27:54] says we're going to read it in just a
[27:55] little while but just to get you to see
[27:58] that to me the sixth seal just kind of
[28:00] keeps opening up a little more and
[28:03] opening up a little more and opened up a
[28:05] little more because you got to remember
[28:07] one thing brother Branham preached his
[28:08] heart out on the sixth seal priest is
[28:11] hired out wanted to preach on the
[28:15] trumpets wanted to preach on the seven
[28:18] trumpets he kept saying I want to get a
[28:20] building I wanted to do this and then
[28:22] God had to show him somewhere between
[28:25] there and the Feast of the trumpets
[28:27] trumpets that he preached showed him
[28:29] that he had already preached it
[28:30] supernaturally in the sixth seal so all
[28:34] of those trumpets sound under the sixth
[28:36] seal he had already preached them
[28:38] supernaturally so that's what you and I
[28:40] need to see we need to see even though
[28:43] brother Dale or myself or brother Aaron
[28:45] or brother Bob did a good job wings did
[28:46] not give him another hand mani did a
[28:49] good guy bro Lewis and all the ones look
[28:54] at him see them all coming together
[28:55] that's God speaking to us and when it's
[29:00] God speaking to us then we can stand and
[29:02] know that there's a further 'men of the
[29:05] ministry that there's a supernatural
[29:07] element underneath anything whatever
[29:09] we're talking about
[29:10] there's a supernatural element that
[29:12] you've got to catch that's the Thunder
[29:14] that's the voice of God that speaks to
[29:16] you listen the thunders not for
[29:18] everybody when Paul got struck down on
[29:22] the road to Damascus did everybody hear
[29:25] the voice
[29:25] Paul heard the voice because he was
[29:28] predestinated to hear the voice and then
[29:31] Jesus stood one day Bible said it
[29:34] thundered right said some heard a voice
[29:39] but they didn't hear what he said you
[29:43] and I and surely maybe people that's
[29:45] associated around us that may hear a
[29:48] thunder they may hear hear a rumbling
[29:50] but they're not gonna hear the voice you
[29:52] and I are gonna hear the voice of God
[29:54] speaking to each and every one of us and
[29:57] when you take that voice and then you
[29:59] apply it to your life that's why the
[30:00] trumpets we'll get into it in just a
[30:03] minute we'll talk about just for the
[30:04] trumpets for a little while because
[30:05] that's what we based our message on
[30:08] today is the trumpet brother branham
[30:11] said the trumpet is a is a war it's a
[30:16] scriptural war I'll read it to you it
[30:20] when a trumpet sounds it's a scriptural
[30:24] war you said no it calls it yeah it
[30:26] calls is really go listen when they were
[30:28] out in the battlefield look the only
[30:30] place before we had all this electronic
[30:32] stuff the only way that a the only way
[30:34] that a army could communicate with
[30:36] itself was blowing a trumpet you
[30:40] remember the Calvary and them in the
[30:42] John Wayne movies some have tears like
[30:46] John Wayne who wasn't like John Wayne
[30:48] movie things like oh no your other jog
[30:50] like John Wayne movie anyway and that's
[30:53] all right no big deal but they were
[30:57] sound a certain trumpet you know the
[30:58] retreat or you sound the trumpet knew in
[31:00] advance that sound the trumpet and
[31:02] something would happen every time a
[31:03] trumpet sounded but you had to know what
[31:05] that trumpet meant other than that you
[31:08] just heard his rugby blow that's the
[31:10] same way it is now and
[31:12] thinking while bob was preaching it you
[31:15] know everybody knew who Joseph was
[31:19] remember he's preaching wins now
[31:21] everybody knew who Joseph was because he
[31:25] was the smartest guy I mean he was the
[31:27] Pharaoh basically said Joseph you take
[31:31] care of the country and I'm just gonna
[31:32] you know I'm just gonna sit in here and
[31:33] be the king I mean you know if you had
[31:35] to get the Pharaoh you got to Joseph but
[31:38] they didn't get all the intricacies of
[31:40] Joseph number one they didn't know he
[31:43] was a Jew at first right they didn't
[31:46] know his daddy at giving the coat of
[31:48] many colors they in Egypt the world
[31:51] didn't know what I'm saying I'm saying
[31:54] to you as you walk through the world so
[31:56] I was thinking when he was preaching
[31:57] when you walk through the world there's
[31:59] a lot more than just Samuel Dale being
[32:01] the pastor spoken word church and he
[32:03] lives in Guilford Georgia there's a lot
[32:05] more goes to that you talkin coat of
[32:07] many colors you talkin about experiences
[32:09] in life and I'm saying all of you see
[32:13] when this sixth seal opens it's a total
[32:15] disruption of nature it's the total
[32:17] disruption of your nature the nature
[32:19] that you used to have should be dead but
[32:23] there is still a nature that you got to
[32:25] work on amen there still is a nature
[32:29] that we work on because you have to put
[32:31] that statue of a perfect man right in
[32:33] this sixth seal and we'll talk about
[32:40] that a little bit later so let's read a
[32:43] few quotes number one the sixth seal
[32:50] burger for 125 let's just read the read
[32:54] and this is just all we're doing
[32:55] backgrounding right here for a second
[32:56] compare scripture of this great event
[32:58] that will see this great secret or
[33:00] mystery that was under the sixth seal of
[33:02] the book of redemption now the great
[33:04] mystery now we know the mystery on the
[33:07] surface the mystery the seal the part
[33:10] that had it sealed was those two
[33:12] prophets but underneath there there's
[33:15] something we need to understand it's not
[33:17] going to put us in the rapture just to
[33:19] know that the two prophets or Moses and
[33:22] Elijah and they're going problems our
[33:24] 1260 days that's all
[33:26] in the Bible but it's how that a prophet
[33:29] come and sounded the trumpet in the end
[33:35] time to get me and you out of here to
[33:38] take us home to get us out of the way so
[33:41] that the two prophets can come so it has
[33:44] to be then the book of redemption now we
[33:48] always now listen we try to think
[33:50] sometimes be a little narrow minded that
[33:54] the book of redemption is that New
[33:56] Testament man that's what book of
[33:59] redemption started in the book of
[34:00] Genesis it's the book of redemption it's
[34:04] not the New Testament of redemption if
[34:06] the whole book of Redemption which is
[34:09] the whole sixty-six books in the Bible
[34:11] you know right
[34:13] but sometimes we go well with I was born
[34:16] again because I read acts 2:38 alright
[34:20] that's okay
[34:22] but there's more there's more if that
[34:25] Old Testament hasn't been there look at
[34:27] all the types and shadows we could never
[34:28] use think about how many times we type
[34:34] and use the Old Testament and you got to
[34:37] remember one thing's for sure Paul
[34:39] didn't have a New Testament to write
[34:40] from he was writing the New Testament
[34:43] from the Old Testament scrolls that he
[34:47] took on the backside of the desert and
[34:49] read them and brought Jesus Christ out
[34:51] of that we say well no that was just a
[34:54] bunch of lambs and a bunch of this in a
[34:56] bunch that was all speaking across a man
[35:00] so that's what you and I want sweets
[35:01] when we start seeing this see oh let's
[35:03] let's look number one on the surface we
[35:06] have to look at the earthquakes the
[35:08] blood the fire the smoke and all these
[35:10] things because that's what's naturally
[35:11] going to happen but that's not going to
[35:13] help us I just thank God that we're
[35:17] going to be going when all that's
[35:18] happening cuz that's a literal happening
[35:22] but now under the sixth seal of the book
[35:26] of redemption now remember these are
[35:28] hidden mysteries and the sixth seal
[35:31] altogether is one great big book six
[35:34] crows because remember look six seals
[35:38] finishes Redemption with some
[35:40] that last Sunday the six seal at all six
[35:43] seals finishes Redemption because the
[35:45] Seventh Seal there's nothing written
[35:46] there's no motion there's no action
[35:48] there's no it's just silence in heaven
[35:50] for spacing 1/2 an hour that's all it
[35:53] was
[35:53] that's not what's rolled up in the book
[35:55] that is the book that is the book the
[35:59] Seventh Seal is the book you can't do
[36:01] away with the Seventh Seal but the six
[36:03] seals these six sails finishes
[36:06] Redemption all right same as we were
[36:09] talking last Sunday about the six fold
[36:10] purpose of Daniel the six seals
[36:13] parallels perfectly with the six fold
[36:16] purpose because what puts us into
[36:19] Millennium is what puts Israel in the
[36:21] Millennium everybody got that same an
[36:23] remember we're talking about the seventy
[36:26] weeks of Daniel and how that people have
[36:28] it all messed up they just don't
[36:29] understand what brother Aaron was
[36:30] talking about because you can't bring in
[36:33] everlasting righteousness during the
[36:36] Battle of Armageddon you just can't you
[36:43] can't place it you can't place all these
[36:47] like the last three of the six fold
[36:49] purpose now we'll read it in a minute
[36:51] but doing away with iniquity and sin and
[36:56] all that stuff I can see the two
[36:57] prophets standing on earth doing a ways
[37:00] by the Word of God doing away with the
[37:02] sins of 144,000 but now that's for just
[37:05] 1260 days that's not for seven years
[37:08] that's just for 1260 days amen
[37:13] but their stuff goes on after that and
[37:15] that's what the people to message don't
[37:17] see there is only 1260 days of Jesus's
[37:20] ministry left on the earth
[37:22] no doubt no doubt but there are seven
[37:27] years left to finish the seventy weeks
[37:31] of Daniel
[37:32] now that's according to the Bible so if
[37:34] you want to argue all I'm gonna do is
[37:36] I'm gonna take you to Daniel 9:24
[37:39] seventy weeks are determined to do what
[37:41] six things once so six things are
[37:44] finished then their Redemption is over
[37:49] just kind of plain and simple but look
[37:52] it's just six Scrolls roll
[37:54] they're in unwinds the whole book of
[37:55] redemption that's how the whole earth
[37:58] now see he brings a whole earth the
[38:00] whole earth is redeemed under this under
[38:02] this seal demands that all right we're
[38:06] gonna take a look take a look take my
[38:07] time a little bit today that's just okay
[38:09] number two the sixth seal is the
[38:15] Tribulation Period so we're when we
[38:17] start reading these trumpets and start
[38:20] paralleling the trumpets no one thinks
[38:24] for sure it will happen during that time
[38:26] that those two prophets are preaching
[38:28] there buddy got that say ma'am Amen all
[38:31] right the sixth seal is the Tribulation
[38:34] Period that's what takes place the bride
[38:37] is gone and there's no living creature
[38:40] nothing there to say it now God is not
[38:43] dealing with the church no more now
[38:44] we've already established that I just
[38:45] want to read it again it's been gone
[38:48] remember we go up in Revelations for one
[38:50] alright not seeing the revelations 19
[38:52] this is when Israel receives the message
[38:55] of the kingdom by the two prophets of
[38:57] revelations 11 remember Israel is a
[39:00] nation God's servant nation and when
[39:02] when Israel is brought in it'll be a
[39:04] national affair Israel the kingdom ages
[39:07] were David the son of David sits on the
[39:09] throne and as brother day I was talking
[39:11] about this morning if you'll go back in
[39:15] the Old Testament that is the promise is
[39:17] in the Old Testament that the son of
[39:20] David there would not be a time that
[39:22] there wouldn't be a son of David on the
[39:24] throne well what's he going to do he's
[39:25] gonna come back into his part of his
[39:28] kingdom set on a literal throne and
[39:31] judge the twelve tribes of Israel that's
[39:33] what it says in the Old Testament the
[39:35] son of David which will be Jesus Christ
[39:37] will sit there judging the twelve tribes
[39:40] of Israel are the 144,000 twelve times
[39:44] twelve in the Millennium done all right
[39:47] and we'll be there on a honeymoon his
[39:51] bride on the honeymoon we're not there
[39:54] to any kind of national affair or
[39:56] anything sure we can talk and do things
[39:58] but it's not for us
[40:00] we've already fulfilled everything we
[40:03] need to fulfill you said no what about
[40:06] the future home the future
[40:08] was just an event you've got the future
[40:10] home inside of you today because it says
[40:12] it was a bride adorned for her husband
[40:14] you got your part of the future home the
[40:17] streets are going to live on the house
[40:18] you're gonna live in it's inside of you
[40:21] now so we're done once we get once we
[40:24] get this thing changed we're done
[40:25] there's nothing else no gain or loss or
[40:28] you know we don't need another property
[40:30] to come and tell us the same thing we
[40:31] don't need the two witnesses to come and
[40:33] tell us anything 144,000 it's just going
[40:37] to be a wonderful day that when we go
[40:39] into that temple when they build that
[40:41] temple and we go in as the anointing of
[40:43] the temple that's what brother Branham
[40:44] said that were the anointing to the
[40:46] temple then what's going to happen is
[40:48] that temple is going to be set up for an
[40:50] example outer Court justification inner
[40:55] court sanctification our outer Court
[40:58] inner Court and Holy of Holies baptism
[41:00] the Holy Ghost we can explain to anybody
[41:02] that walks up hey this is what God
[41:05] wanted you to build but this is not why
[41:07] he was building he was building this the
[41:11] outer court the inner court and the Holy
[41:15] of Holies and then so there you're just
[41:18] a walking timer and ankle and then
[41:20] you're a walking city you're in
[41:24] tricera I'm liking what brother Dale
[41:27] says we're looking for something to come
[41:28] when it's already here I mean the reason
[41:33] the future homes not coming down right
[41:35] now it's because scriptures got to be
[41:37] fulfilled I mean it's proven they got to
[41:42] be 144,000 brought out of Israel so
[41:44] that's got to happen then there's got to
[41:47] be a millennium then there's got to be a
[41:49] battle of dog you may God all that's
[41:51] gotta happen before the future home come
[41:53] but you've already got the future home
[41:55] in you now you are the future home there
[41:57] will be no one in that future home
[41:59] except you that lives there no one else
[42:01] will live there now people can come in
[42:04] and people can leave but no one else
[42:07] would us in the 144,000 which will be
[42:10] eunuchs or servants in that city no one
[42:13] else will be in that city why cuz
[42:15] they're not part of it you're part of it
[42:17] you are that City
[42:20] all right let's go to number three if it
[42:25] is so now for we know that this sixth
[42:27] seal is the judgment seal so true now
[42:31] we're going to read in the trumpet where
[42:36] all this is going to happen to the world
[42:38] this is a worldwide event worldwide
[42:42] event this is not just going to happen
[42:44] in a little spot called Israel no it's a
[42:47] worldwide event all right the six cells
[42:51] of judgment still even the foolish
[42:53] virgin are going to be hunted down and
[42:55] killed there's going to be people killed
[42:57] during this 1260 days that these two
[43:00] prophets like I said before the nation's
[43:03] watch them when they die and send gifts
[43:06] to each other so the whole world knows
[43:08] about what's going on all right
[43:11] because really let's thinking let's
[43:14] think in our terms right now if you had
[43:16] two guys standing in one place I don't
[43:20] think they're all gonna both be together
[43:21] the whole time you know when one waltz
[43:23] turn no they're gonna be out in the city
[43:25] but don't you think that the Mossad CIA
[43:29] FBI Kremlin whoever what is that how'd
[43:36] you know that
[43:37] KGB
[43:41] you look a little Russian to me brother
[43:44] the KGB no don't you think they're gonna
[43:47] want to kill them two guys there's only
[43:49] two guys it's not like a million is two
[43:51] and they know who they are because that
[43:54] guy got the Moses goes I test this turn
[43:57] out River in the red blood and this
[44:00] thing just becomes red don't you think
[44:01] they'll know who they are they're not
[44:03] going to be doing this in secret what
[44:04] I'm saying but for 1260 days that
[44:07] anointing is going to be on them where
[44:08] they cannot die if we can get that
[44:12] anointing and understand that anointing
[44:14] you and I'll do the same thing amen but
[44:17] it's promising that it's not promised
[44:18] we're gonna die it's promised we're
[44:21] gonna go up in the sky mmm till the six
[44:24] seals the judgement seal judgment seal
[44:26] exactly what it is
[44:27] we have the anti-castro seen the church
[44:30] go now it's finished then with the
[44:32] martyrs of them Jews back there under
[44:34] the altar he's working his way through
[44:35] the seals now here is the breaking
[44:37] fourth of the judgment upon the people
[44:39] we're out of this tribulation judgment
[44:41] will come forth 144,000 redeemed Jews
[44:44] I'll prove it to you they are Jews and
[44:47] not Gentiles they have nothing to do
[44:49] with the bride not a thing and that's
[44:51] correct they're not brought their
[44:54] 144,000 their servants they're not
[44:56] bribed remember Israel we went through
[44:58] that whole part where Israel give up he
[45:00] divorced them they cannot be his wife
[45:02] anymore he can't take back a woman that
[45:05] has been defiled he can take her back to
[45:07] be a wife all right we done seen the
[45:10] bride go we can't place that anywhere
[45:12] else don't come back until the
[45:13] nineteenth chapter of the book of we
[45:15] know that's the book of Revelation now
[45:18] notice for the sixth seal is the
[45:19] judgment seal of the word the man so we
[45:24] know then this sixth seal is the
[45:26] judgment seal of the word and where does
[45:29] judgment begin at the house of God so
[45:33] we're under that six seal right now our
[45:38] part of it we're under our part of the
[45:41] sixth seal every time you come in church
[45:42] every time you read the word every time
[45:44] somebody we talk about things and and
[45:46] and it brings a judgment the judgment
[45:49] seal of the words all right let's
[45:53] go now to revelations and this read and
[45:56] I will give power unto my two witnesses
[45:58] and they shall prophesy one thousand two
[46:00] hundred and threescore days that's 12
[46:02] hundred and sixty days clothed in
[46:03] sackcloth these are the two olive trees
[46:05] now I didn't reference that but there's
[46:08] talks of two olive trees I believe over
[46:10] in Aaron Richard asked Aaron for those
[46:20] of you that weren't there last night
[46:21] there was a question if you had a
[46:23] question or if you were playing this
[46:25] game and you needed a lifeline you
[46:27] needed somebody to call who would it be
[46:29] call well it was scattered all over the
[46:31] place but definitely Richard was gonna
[46:33] call Aaron and several other people is
[46:36] gonna call Aaron so so anyway but no it
[46:43] does talk about in the Old Testament
[46:44] about the two olive trees all right so
[46:46] it's not something not something
[46:48] exclusive to the New Testament these are
[46:50] the two olive trees and the two
[46:51] candlesticks standing before the god of
[46:53] the earth and if any man will hurt them
[46:55] fire proceedeth out of their mouth and
[46:57] devoureth their enemies and if any man
[46:59] will hurt them he must in this manner be
[47:01] killed these have power to shut heaven
[47:03] that it rain not in the days of their
[47:05] prophecy which was Elijah and have power
[47:08] over waters to turn them to blood which
[47:10] is Moses and to smite the earth with all
[47:13] plagues as often as they will remember
[47:16] one thing before natural Israel was let
[47:21] go out of Egypt what happened plagues
[47:25] fell all the plagues fell before Israel
[47:30] left Egypt same way with you and I same
[47:35] way with 144,000 God's just continued in
[47:40] his continuity all the way through and
[47:42] when they shall have finished their
[47:44] testimony the Beast that ascendeth out
[47:45] of the bottomless pit shall make war
[47:47] against them let can I interpolate just
[47:50] a moment that's all right go to 9 Daniel
[47:53] 9 and he shall make confirm the covenant
[47:56] with many for what one week that's why
[47:59] there's one week left after the rapture
[48:01] one week but in the midst of the week he
[48:04] will cause the sacrifice and oblation to
[48:07] cease that's it right there told there's
[48:13] 1260 days left of the Ministry of the
[48:15] two prophets once they're finished that
[48:18] man is going to kill them in the middle
[48:22] of that week of that last week they he
[48:26] is going to kill them and then what's
[48:28] gonna happen the Battle of Armageddon is
[48:30] gonna happen once the 144,000 go into
[48:33] rapture there's a Battle of Armageddon
[48:35] gonna happen right and look that's not
[48:38] gonna be a one day battle we were
[48:40] talking about this other day listen
[48:41] that's not a one day battle that's
[48:45] nuclear destruction just for a tidbit of
[48:49] information it may take three years
[48:52] before everybody dies after the Battle
[48:56] of Armageddon it's not gonna be like the
[48:57] Battle of Gog and Magog where God's
[48:59] gonna go come down and just kill the
[49:01] souls he's just gonna take care of
[49:03] everything wipe it all off God's fire is
[49:05] much hotter than a nuclear fire but this
[49:09] is a nuclear explosion and there will be
[49:12] time for it that's why I say the 70
[49:15] weeks of Daniel can in that's the Battle
[49:18] of Armageddon
[49:18] there's still time and what do you
[49:22] believe that or not go back to the Bible
[49:24] there's one week left in the signing of
[49:27] that treaty and then in the midst of the
[49:29] week it'll be cut off and he's going to
[49:30] kill the two prophets once he kills the
[49:33] two prophets what's going to happen
[49:34] they're gonna what raise up in three and
[49:37] a half days and then they're going in a
[49:38] rapture then what's gonna happen then
[49:41] they're gonna start pressing the buttons
[49:42] everybody's going to be mad at everybody
[49:44] else and they're just gonna start
[49:45] mashing nuclear power nuclear weapons
[49:48] you're gonna well you're not but they're
[49:51] gonna see things that has never been
[49:52] seen before amen
[49:54] all right so now let's go to the next
[49:57] number four is everybody all right ma'am
[50:00] I like what Bob said Wednesday night
[50:03] don't guess what that little tidbit he
[50:04] said Wednesday not about being bored
[50:07] because of all this information
[50:08] somebody's giving us on the seals I know
[50:09] you talking about me Bob
[50:15] right down Berlin template tell movies
[50:21] but that's alright
[50:23] this is what's putting this together so
[50:25] that we can understand and it may be
[50:27] boring to some and I've never been bored
[50:29] by teaching I love teaching I exciting
[50:31] to watch teaching this book sometimes
[50:33] just all that other that I I'm in
[50:37] because you know why I want to learn and
[50:39] in learning you need somebody teaching
[50:41] you need somebody to break it down you
[50:42] need somebody to do that and and you
[50:45] know he gives us all gifts to use and I
[50:49] hope the god were using them everybody's
[50:51] using them right cuz we need all five we
[50:54] need all five not just one I could say
[50:57] something awful good right here I just
[50:58] did but I guess I'll hold it till
[51:01] tomorrow night and have power over the
[51:02] waters to turn them to blood smite the
[51:04] earth who places off to do with what is
[51:06] it what can bring these things but the
[51:08] word now look you would have thought he
[51:11] would have took that process and said
[51:13] you'll moved it
[51:15] what can bring these things but the two
[51:17] prophets that's not what he said he said
[51:20] what can bring these things but the word
[51:22] listen those two prophets are not just
[51:24] going to stand there and be totally let
[51:26] totally illiterate God is going to
[51:28] anoint the word that they have just like
[51:30] God is going to anoint come on people
[51:32] God's going to anoint the word just like
[51:34] here no it's the word for you he's going
[51:36] to anoint the word that you have it one
[51:38] day we're going to have enough word to
[51:39] anoint to take this thing and change it
[51:43] but that's exactly what they're doing
[51:45] they can do nature any way they want to
[51:49] here it is
[51:50] they're the one who brings on this sixth
[51:53] seal they uncover and open up now
[51:56] they're not gonna stand over there and
[51:58] go where the sixth seal and we're gonna
[52:00] open it up no they're going to teach
[52:02] those 144,000 and like I said before
[52:05] it's not just gonna be 100 it's not just
[52:07] gonna be two prophets with all the word
[52:09] and nobody else there's a hundred and
[52:12] forty-four thousand gonna sit in a
[52:14] congregation or stand somewhere
[52:16] listening to what they say and that word
[52:20] is gonna be come alive alive in their
[52:22] heart and they're gonna be able to speak
[52:25] they're gonna be
[52:26] to do what these do I just believe that
[52:30] but these are two prophets they're the
[52:32] ones that bring it on they're the ones
[52:34] that open that seek seal now once you
[52:36] open the seal it's not private anymore
[52:39] it's public once you open the seal once
[52:43] you look what we said before once you
[52:46] pull that sail off look you can read
[52:47] everybody can read it amen
[52:51] that's what we're doing now that's the
[52:54] one who brings on the sixth seal they
[52:55] uncover and open it it's the power of
[52:57] God to interrupt nature see the sixth
[53:00] seal is completely an interruption of
[53:02] nature because that's all it talks about
[53:04] its nature natural things all right do
[53:07] you get it now there's your seal who
[53:09] does it it's the prophets the other side
[53:11] of the rapture your brother Rama is
[53:13] placing them after the rapture the two
[53:15] prophets if you have any doubt given to
[53:17] prophets are on the other side of the
[53:19] rapture with the power of God the Word
[53:22] of God like I say they're not justice
[53:25] come come up one day and stand out in
[53:26] the middle of what's the minute like in
[53:29] the middle of Jerusalem that I'm just
[53:32] gonna stand on the street and go rain
[53:34] fire hail earthquake no they're going to
[53:38] start preaching the gospel and in
[53:41] preaching the gospel is going to bring
[53:43] these things to pass you ever thought
[53:48] about this what's gonna cost California
[53:50] the st. cuz god just one day figured
[53:51] he's gonna flip a switch and that
[53:52] California's gonna hit to hit the ocean
[53:54] I noticed last night did you all know
[53:57] this last night Terence read the
[54:03] question said where would you take your
[54:04] wife on a honeymoon if you had three
[54:06] destinations one was Paris one was
[54:08] Honolulu and one was Los Angeles
[54:09] nobody chose Los Angeles for some silly
[54:16] reason nobody chose Los Angeles so
[54:20] anyway but they're doomed to look what
[54:22] weep we snigger about it but listen
[54:24] that's millions of people gonna die real
[54:26] quick but it's because of what they did
[54:29] and God knew they would and he put a
[54:32] prophet on the earth just like the two
[54:35] prophets that's doing over there that
[54:37] prophet stood and condemned
[54:38] Los Angeles so Los Angeles will go under
[54:43] the ocean amen but it hadn't yet why
[54:53] because we're still here so who's gonna
[54:56] bring home that earthquake I am the I am
[55:02] is gonna do it who can send earthquakes
[55:05] turn the moon into blood Sun can go down
[55:07] or anything at their command they man
[55:08] there you are there you are see see how
[55:11] the seals open down there in the church
[55:13] age is how it showed the martyrs and now
[55:16] here's these two prophets standing here
[55:17] with the Word of God to do anything the
[55:19] nature they want to and they shape the
[55:21] earth now I believe they're going to
[55:23] shape the earth with the gospel first it
[55:27] has to be like I said about a trumpet a
[55:29] trumpet denotes a battle a scriptural
[55:33] war when Luther came on the scene a
[55:36] trumpet sounded a spiritual war happened
[55:40] if you don't believe that I'm got the
[55:42] quote right here I'll read it to you
[55:43] just a minute or either I got it I left
[55:46] it back there for next Sunday and it
[55:51] shows us actually who does it is Moses
[55:52] and Elijah because there's their
[55:54] ministry re impersonated again both men
[55:57] oh my do you see it now to see what the
[55:59] sixth seal is it's those two prophets
[56:01] now notice don't let it choke you but
[56:03] watch what open that seal prophet you
[56:06] know why he said don't let it choke you
[56:07] because there's two the prophet behind
[56:11] that pulpit making that statement and he
[56:13] was opening the seals to a Gentile
[56:16] Church he's not a he's not a Jew proper
[56:18] Jewish prophet he's a Gentile prophet to
[56:21] a Gentile Church so he was talking to me
[56:24] and you see Amen there you are old we're
[56:28] living in the eagle day see he's he's
[56:30] identifying it right there we're living
[56:32] in the eagle day brother head up among
[56:34] the clouds they opened that seat sealed
[56:37] they have power to do it
[56:38] there's your sixth seal coming open then
[56:41] alright man alright next let's talk
[56:46] let's look at Daniel right here seventy
[56:48] weeks of determine let's just just for a
[56:50] second then we'll get into the
[56:51] into the trumpets thereby alright
[56:54] seventy weeks are determined upon thy
[56:56] people and upon the holy city to do six
[56:58] things one finished transgression to
[57:01] make an end of sin three mate
[57:04] reconciliation for iniquity and I
[57:05] stopped right there in the red because
[57:07] you can't bring in everlasting
[57:09] righteousness with all heck breaking
[57:12] loose under the Battle of Armageddon
[57:14] bringing in everlasting righteousness
[57:16] brother Brown says it's going heading
[57:18] toward into the Millennium that's
[57:21] bringing the everlasting Roxton listen
[57:23] that's what the Jews are looking for
[57:24] they never heard remember what sounded
[57:28] what sounded before the 50th Jubilee was
[57:34] to take place a trumpet they never got
[57:37] that trumpet sounded to bring in their
[57:41] Jubilee their Jubilee was the Millennium
[57:45] that they never got to now they had the
[57:51] land that would rest in there for seven
[57:52] years you had something happen but the
[57:54] Bible says in Leviticus I'm going
[57:56] through and reading Leviticus again to
[57:58] get the feast days in all down
[58:00] but what happened seven Sabbath's which
[58:03] is 49 and then you haloth the fifth and
[58:06] then the trumpet sound for the 50th
[58:08] Jubilee they never they never never
[58:11] celebrated the fifty why because you had
[58:14] to give everything back that you had and
[58:16] it's you ain't gonna do that a natural
[58:19] Jews not but as spirituals you will and
[58:21] then so what's going to happen the two
[58:23] prophets are going to preach 1260 days
[58:27] to finish the transgression of Israel
[58:29] cuz this is to the Jews this is Daniel
[58:32] and thy people in the holy city right
[58:34] now people Jews and upon thy holy city
[58:37] comes remember there's a city to be
[58:40] built according to Ezekiel 40 44 there's
[58:43] a Millennial temple to be built by the
[58:45] Jews they're burnt right with that same
[58:49] man so that thy holy city because look
[58:52] if they drop a bomb in the Vatican
[58:55] remember they go atomic bomb they're not
[58:58] going to leave Israel out they gonna
[59:00] drop one down that mosque of Omar and
[59:02] the whole city of Jerusalem is just
[59:04] going to be flat rubble
[59:05] so that's really not talking about that
[59:07] city because he's restoring not
[59:10] destroying he's restoring so they got to
[59:13] build that Millennial temple yeah they
[59:15] got to have the seven years left because
[59:17] three and a half of it took up by
[59:20] bringing Israel back to their Day of
[59:22] Atonement they got to come to that day
[59:28] of atonement you and I had to come to a
[59:30] day of atonement not the killing of the
[59:33] Lamb but to realize that Christ already
[59:35] a man Christ already died for you he
[59:39] didn't have to in 2000 and or in 1998 he
[59:42] didn't have to crawl up on the cross and
[59:44] die for me again no I had to realize it
[59:47] under the feast of atonement under that
[59:51] day of atonement there was a day I
[59:54] realized that Christ had already died
[59:56] for me you don't
[59:59] riku the laments of mourning for the
[1:00:01] kill that's already happened so what's
[1:00:04] the to profit is going to do they're not
[1:00:05] going to preach Christ is going to be
[1:00:07] crucified and Christ is going to come
[1:00:10] he's already come they've already killed
[1:00:13] they killed their lamb 2,000 years ago
[1:00:15] it was my lamb too but the two prophets
[1:00:19] has to tell them that's where you turned
[1:00:22] him down so what finish the
[1:00:24] transgression where did they transgress
[1:00:25] right there at Calvary where do they
[1:00:27] make their sin let his blood be on us in
[1:00:29] our children brother brown sin and to
[1:00:31] make reconciliation for iniquity he said
[1:00:33] that's where God had to literally blind
[1:00:35] their eyes so that you and I could come
[1:00:36] in amen literally blind in their eyes so
[1:00:39] you and I could come in so he had to do
[1:00:42] this God had to save Israel he said I'll
[1:00:44] never forget him right I'll never forget
[1:00:47] him
[1:00:48] how can a woman I read you the scripture
[1:00:51] what about that how can a woman had a
[1:00:53] baby deny that she had a baby can't do
[1:00:55] that so how could God deny that he had
[1:00:58] this wife at one time but he divorced
[1:01:01] her but that was his children though
[1:01:04] that was his people then after the 1260
[1:01:09] days the middle of the 70th week he
[1:01:12] comes to bring in everlasting
[1:01:14] righteousness seal up the vision and
[1:01:16] prophecy because it won't be prophesying
[1:01:19] I won't be prophesying anymore it'll be
[1:01:22] a reality
[1:01:23] listen Malachi 4 is not a prophecy it's
[1:01:28] already come to pass and to anoint the
[1:01:32] most holy and if you'll read your Daniel
[1:01:34] 7 2 weeks book brother Brahim said the
[1:01:36] anoint the most holy
[1:01:37] is us walking into the Millennial temple
[1:01:41] going into the Millennium so the six
[1:01:46] fold purpose puts them in the Millennium
[1:01:48] we get a revelation of the revelation of
[1:01:51] the six seals we're going to take a
[1:01:52] rapture that's there for redemption
[1:01:56] because look they're full redemption
[1:01:58] listen mine and your full redemption is
[1:02:00] for this thing to be changed amen
[1:02:03] we are not guaranteed a city we're not
[1:02:07] even guaranteed a piece of land but they
[1:02:12] are thy people and upon thy holy city
[1:02:17] there's only one holy city to garden
[1:02:18] that's Jerusalem so he's gonna actually
[1:02:21] restore them and concede look we don't
[1:02:24] get a promise he's not gonna restore the
[1:02:26] United States of America yet we are a
[1:02:28] nation yeah we're supposed to be a godly
[1:02:31] nation yet we have land we're not
[1:02:33] promised that but Israel is promised
[1:02:36] that seventy weeks are determined upon
[1:02:38] thy people upon thy holy city in other
[1:02:40] words to bring all of it by that
[1:02:43] millennial temple is not going to be
[1:02:45] built in China or the United States it's
[1:02:51] gonna be built right there right there
[1:02:54] in Jerusalem so he's going to restore
[1:02:56] the people in the 1260 days then the
[1:03:01] Battle of Armageddon is going to happen
[1:03:02] and then whatever you think happens that
[1:03:05] here's my thought done listen a Jew can
[1:03:08] only build a temple we can't build
[1:03:09] temples we don't know how we'll have
[1:03:14] build temples but Jews from the day they
[1:03:16] were born knows that there's an out of
[1:03:18] court and the court in the holy Holies
[1:03:19] and what the dimensions are so what if
[1:03:21] 144,000 comes back down here and builds
[1:03:24] the temple while we're still up there
[1:03:25] and then we come walking right back into
[1:03:28] that temple and head right into the
[1:03:30] Millennium how beautiful is that
[1:03:33] cuz that my brides not gonna build my
[1:03:37] house right I'm gonna play somebody to
[1:03:42] build it I'm gonna have a higher
[1:03:43] servants all right so I said we're in a
[1:03:47] honeymoon we don't have to do anything
[1:03:49] that's the bride of Jesus Christ but I
[1:03:51] believe in 144,000 and you can say
[1:03:54] whatever you want to about the fifth
[1:03:55] seal Jew heathen I you know this is not
[1:03:58] a for us to discuss and the talk about
[1:04:01] the seals but take him build that temple
[1:04:03] and then here we come right down into it
[1:04:05] and we're the anointing to the temple
[1:04:08] how about that what a time lays ahead
[1:04:12] for us now let's look at where brother
[1:04:15] Branham talks in number five in the 70th
[1:04:17] year of Daniel our 70th week rather
[1:04:20] coming to an end of sin put it away you
[1:04:22] understand now what's the first to
[1:04:24] finish the transgression you make them
[1:04:26] end of sin number three to make
[1:04:27] reconciliation for iniquity use writing
[1:04:29] it down had about six scriptures going
[1:04:32] on down look number 86 to make
[1:04:34] reconciliation for iniquity iniquity is
[1:04:36] doing wrong as they did at the cross he
[1:04:40] made reconciliation because remember
[1:04:42] he's the only one that can reconcile
[1:04:43] because he's one it blinded him right
[1:04:46] here look he made reconciliation but it
[1:04:50] will not be applied to them in other
[1:04:52] words at Calvary they turned him down so
[1:04:54] the the 2000 years of a Gentile Church
[1:04:57] was not to Israel they're getting their
[1:05:01] 1260 days later why it was not applied
[1:05:06] to them why because they were blinded
[1:05:09] and could not see it and why didn't they
[1:05:12] blind you say well maybe today I'm
[1:05:14] because I'm blind you're willfully blind
[1:05:16] they were blind because God blinded them
[1:05:20] you're willfully blind if you're blind
[1:05:22] there's no reconciliation for you but
[1:05:24] that there is reconciliation when Daddy
[1:05:27] when the father puts his hand over the
[1:05:29] kids eyes and says I got to take a
[1:05:31] Gentile bride but you know what I'm
[1:05:33] going to release my hand one day there's
[1:05:35] gonna be 1260 days and I'm going to
[1:05:38] preach and bring 144,000 people out of
[1:05:41] this chaos and I'm going to put them in
[1:05:45] a millennium let's go the neck
[1:05:46] from face of the trumpets now this may
[1:05:53] get a little technical so I may slow
[1:05:54] down just for a few minutes that's all
[1:05:56] right if I'm boring you you can go home
[1:05:59] okay
[1:06:01] Pentecost feast finished at the period
[1:06:04] of the seventh trumpet pay attention for
[1:06:09] the next is the coming of the seventh
[1:06:11] seal for the next is the mystery of the
[1:06:13] coming of Christ because what is the
[1:06:15] seventh seal the seven seals are coming
[1:06:17] to the Lord okay all right
[1:06:18] that's why that one there seventh
[1:06:21] trumpet they get the coming of the Lord
[1:06:22] they don't get to coming we get but they
[1:06:25] still get a comment the Lord has to come
[1:06:26] and pick them 144,000 and two people up
[1:06:29] and take them in a rapture they don't
[1:06:31] pick themself up and go in the rapture
[1:06:32] of God has to come and pick them up and
[1:06:34] take them in a rapture so they do get a
[1:06:36] coming for the next is the mystery of
[1:06:38] the coming of Christ and also the
[1:06:39] trumpet is sound for the Jews now
[1:06:43] remember we hear listen to me we hear a
[1:06:46] gospel trumpet that's what births you
[1:06:49] into the body on your day of Pentecost
[1:06:53] you have a day of Pentecost on the day
[1:06:57] of Pentecost the Holy Ghost fell on you
[1:07:03] hey man you got a damn Pentecost
[1:07:07] so we're live well now listen we're
[1:07:09] living now under the Feast of the
[1:07:10] Tabernacles Tabernacles not booths they
[1:07:16] have a literal day where they sit in the
[1:07:18] booth for so many days no God lived in
[1:07:22] your booth there are six trumpet is
[1:07:26] sound and when it does it makes known to
[1:07:28] them the revealed Son of God one
[1:07:32] half-hour silence remember all trumpet
[1:07:35] sound on this sixth seal the sixth seal
[1:07:38] finishes the mystery under the sixth
[1:07:41] seal just before the seventh is open now
[1:07:45] listen remember a trumpet when they
[1:07:47] trumpet sounds it denotes a spiritual or
[1:07:51] scriptural war but there was a trumpet
[1:07:56] that sounded for Israel to get up and
[1:07:58] move or stop
[1:08:00] remember the priest would stand out blow
[1:08:02] the trumpet and we would move the pillow
[1:08:04] fire would move the priest would see it
[1:08:07] come on that's what's happening now the
[1:08:12] ministry catches the pillar of fire
[1:08:14] moving blows the trumpet on Sunday
[1:08:18] morning Sunday afternoon winds then
[1:08:20] wherever time you match play because
[1:08:25] it's the scriptural war a spiritual war
[1:08:31] so all trumpets sound under the sixth
[1:08:33] seal so all of our trumpets everything
[1:08:36] we need is going to end on the 6l6 hill
[1:08:41] finishes redemption how can you go any
[1:08:42] further than that our redemption though
[1:08:45] is a body changed their redemption is to
[1:08:47] go to messengers going over there
[1:08:50] preaching 1260 days and bringing them
[1:08:52] what to the feast of atonement all right
[1:08:55] okay Pentecost feast finished at the
[1:08:58] period of seventy seventh trumpet so
[1:09:00] look the feast of Pentecost on that when
[1:09:04] the day of Pentecost was fully come
[1:09:07] 2,000 years ago own not on zoos the
[1:09:10] street I'm talking about 2,000 years ago
[1:09:12] when the Holy Ghost fell on 120 that was
[1:09:15] literally on the day of Pentecost by the
[1:09:19] Jewish time and by the Jewish calendar
[1:09:22] Christ was absolutely killed on the day
[1:09:24] of Passover the next day was the feast
[1:09:28] of unleavened bread the next day was the
[1:09:31] feast of firstfruits because he's the
[1:09:33] first one to come up out of the ground I
[1:09:35] love it first when they come upon the
[1:09:37] ground and then fifty days later from
[1:09:40] the Passover he comes back on the day of
[1:09:44] Pentecost and comes into the believer
[1:09:47] that's why Penta is 5 Pentecost 50 all
[1:09:51] right so on the day of Pentecost we got
[1:09:53] our Pentecostal feast they're gonna get
[1:09:55] their Pentecostal feast
[1:09:57] amen they gotta get a Pentecostal feast
[1:10:00] they gotta get the new birth they missed
[1:10:02] the one I've got a quote but it's I
[1:10:05] don't want to read it and I need to take
[1:10:09] some time with her brother BAM explains
[1:10:10] that see we got our feast of Pentecost
[1:10:13] then he but he wasn't to them he blinded
[1:10:17] their eyes as a nation so that Feast of
[1:10:20] Pentecost went to them they're waiting
[1:10:22] on their feast of Pentecost
[1:10:24] but you and I got to come to what Feast
[1:10:27] of Tabernacles to get out of here so
[1:10:32] that God can come back and give them
[1:10:35] their Pentecostal feast cuz they've not
[1:10:37] had their Pentecostal feast before but
[1:10:39] the 144,000 will have a Pentecostal
[1:10:42] feast amen
[1:10:44] there may okay with that and I noticed a
[1:10:46] lot of information but it's leading up
[1:10:48] to the trumpets just before the seventh
[1:10:52] seal is open because remember I'll read
[1:10:55] you a quote in a minute maybe at the
[1:10:56] very end where brother Branham says the
[1:10:58] seventh seal is the same as the seventh
[1:11:00] trumpet the seventh seal to us is the
[1:11:04] same as the seventh trumpet to Israel it
[1:11:06] will will not read that today's save
[1:11:08] time I don't want to take much more time
[1:11:09] but let's read them number okay here's
[1:11:15] here's the trumpets and we may get into
[1:11:17] a few of them I may read them and then
[1:11:19] we can go back over that okay I don't
[1:11:21] want to hold you much longer than than
[1:11:23] an hour so and I saw the seven angels
[1:11:26] which stood before God and to them were
[1:11:28] given seven trumpets so these are angels
[1:11:31] that were given seven thereby wagga
[1:11:34] seven trumpets thank you that was the
[1:11:36] whole roll back there went let's have a
[1:11:42] resurrection I know it's hot it's hot up
[1:11:47] here we just ate and bless your heart I
[1:11:49] know it's tough but listen I'll let
[1:11:56] y'all come up here and preach it it'd be
[1:11:57] exciting for you to throw into it you
[1:11:58] won't go sleep I promise there's
[1:12:02] something if we listen now let me just
[1:12:04] stop right here brother's gonna gonna
[1:12:07] get a car lounge they ought to be a
[1:12:08] bathroom allowance for that room right
[1:12:10] in there
[1:12:12] brother brother Terrence deal so this is
[1:12:16] hard you got
[1:12:22] Bob said get a bucket where's he from
[1:12:25] where's he from Monica does he I'm not
[1:12:29] even an ass I'm gonna ask get a bucket
[1:12:35] now mate are you waiting now by the way
[1:12:37] okay
[1:12:38] extra Williams a face so red for how
[1:12:41] much your daddy not you so here we have
[1:12:47] seven angels that are given seven
[1:12:49] trumpets so they're given seven
[1:12:51] different things they got to do all
[1:12:53] right but now watch what all seven are
[1:12:55] well we're gonna read most of them and
[1:12:59] at all parallels right what's gonna
[1:13:02] happen because remember all trumpets all
[1:13:04] of them sound under the sixth seal and
[1:13:06] the sixth seal is those two prophets who
[1:13:09] prophesy 1260 days right no man well
[1:13:13] caught up here now and another eight
[1:13:15] that's why that's why brother Brown said
[1:13:17] God told him he preached these
[1:13:19] supernaturally he didn't read these but
[1:13:22] supernaturally under that seal he
[1:13:24] preached every one of these because he
[1:13:27] was going to take each one and he said
[1:13:29] the Lord spoke to him and said they're
[1:13:31] not for you they're not the trumpets are
[1:13:35] not to you they're to the Jews so then
[1:13:39] brother Brown comes and does a masterful
[1:13:41] job and preaching the Feast of the Trump
[1:13:43] as he brings them all into that one all
[1:13:45] right and another angel came and stood
[1:13:47] at the altar having a golden censer and
[1:13:49] there was given unto Him much incense
[1:13:50] that he should offer it with prayers
[1:13:53] because remember what is incense incense
[1:13:55] is the prayers of the Saints upon the
[1:13:56] golden altar which was before the throne
[1:13:58] now remember this is a scene and the
[1:14:01] smoke of the incense which came up with
[1:14:03] the prayers of the Saints ascended up
[1:14:05] before God out of the Angels hand now
[1:14:08] remember we're not there we're in
[1:14:12] another dimension we're the bride this
[1:14:14] has nothing to do with us now
[1:14:17] spiritually we can read this and see
[1:14:19] that that happens to us in a form or in
[1:14:21] a way but that is not talking about the
[1:14:24] prayers of the saints it's not us
[1:14:26] we're already gone it's the prayers of
[1:14:30] the saints that stopped still on the
[1:14:31] ground still down on the earth and the
[1:14:34] smoke of the incense which came up with
[1:14:35] the prayers
[1:14:36] the Saints ascended up before God out of
[1:14:38] the Angels hand and the angel took the
[1:14:40] censer and filled it with fire of the
[1:14:41] altar and cast it into the earth where
[1:14:45] there were voices and thunderings and
[1:14:46] lightnings quite and the seven angels
[1:14:49] which had the seven trumpets prepared
[1:14:52] themselves to sound listen you don't
[1:14:57] hear it you hear a voice brother they'll
[1:15:03] read each other day John heard a trumpet
[1:15:07] heard the voice turn to see he wasn't
[1:15:11] don't stand over and see a guy blowing a
[1:15:13] horn the only saw a man a guy with a
[1:15:14] message Christ
[1:15:17] the first angel sounded and there
[1:15:20] followed hail and fire mingled with
[1:15:22] blood and they were cast upon the earth
[1:15:25] now look this is all done this is all
[1:15:27] natural and the third part of the trees
[1:15:30] were burnt up and all green grass was
[1:15:31] burnt up and the second angel sounded as
[1:15:34] it were a great mountain burning with
[1:15:36] fire remember what we read in
[1:15:37] Revelations what the two prophets were
[1:15:39] to do hold that right there and I'm
[1:15:41] gonna read them and I beheld when it
[1:15:44] opened the sixth seal you don't go back
[1:15:45] to it brother in the back there was a
[1:15:47] great earthquake we already figured that
[1:15:48] out got an earthquake up here something
[1:15:51] became black and the moon became as
[1:15:52] blood stars of heaven fell upon the
[1:15:54] earth even as a fig tree casteth her
[1:15:56] untimely figs like shake another way
[1:15:58] when heavens departed as a scroll every
[1:16:01] mountain and Island were moved out of
[1:16:06] their places cast into the sea and the
[1:16:09] third part of the sea became blood we
[1:16:11] just read it around here so it's the
[1:16:13] same parallel awful time because
[1:16:15] remember this is this is the wrath of
[1:16:18] God poured out on a sinless world now
[1:16:22] there's a 144,000 protected and - you
[1:16:27] got to including them two problems
[1:16:29] 144,000 and two that's protected nobody
[1:16:32] else is there getting all these plagues
[1:16:35] even the foolish virgin
[1:16:38] everybody and the second angel sounds
[1:16:41] that were a great mountain burning with
[1:16:42] fire is cast into the sea and the third
[1:16:44] part of the sea became blood and the
[1:16:46] third part of the creatures which were
[1:16:47] in the sea and had life died why because
[1:16:49] they can't
[1:16:50] have awful blood how how horrible was
[1:16:54] that gonna be and the third part of the
[1:16:57] ships were destroyed a third of all the
[1:17:00] ships in the world are gonna be
[1:17:02] destroyed and the third angel sounded
[1:17:04] and there fell a great star from heaven
[1:17:06] that's what we're reading right here and
[1:17:07] stars of heaven fell to the earth
[1:17:09] burning as it were a lamp they've always
[1:17:13] said for years that asteroids or the you
[1:17:15] know would hit the earth and they said
[1:17:17] that's what happened back they say what
[1:17:20] caused all this you know the dinosaurs
[1:17:23] to die and all that stuff no I want an
[1:17:25] asteroid it was the flood
[1:17:27] it was the wrath of God at the beginning
[1:17:29] same thing amen
[1:17:33] but if you'll notice he comes to a third
[1:17:37] party he doesn't he remember he promised
[1:17:39] he wouldn't destroy the world water
[1:17:40] anymore he's destroying it with
[1:17:42] everything this time and the third angel
[1:17:44] sounded a fella great star from heaven
[1:17:45] burning is where a lamp and it fell upon
[1:17:47] the third part of the rivers and upon
[1:17:48] the Fountains of water and the name of
[1:17:50] the star is called wormwood and the
[1:17:52] third part of the waters became wormwood
[1:17:53] which is bitter and many of the men died
[1:17:56] of the water because they were made
[1:17:58] bitter so what listen you can live for a
[1:18:01] long time without food but you can't
[1:18:04] live with what seven days without water
[1:18:06] that's a short period of time you talk
[1:18:08] about from today till next Sunday you
[1:18:09] can't live that long without water now a
[1:18:11] lot of us can live without food for
[1:18:14] several months brother Krantz is smiling
[1:18:17] he says Amen some of us longer than
[1:18:20] others Christine would be in trouble
[1:18:25] sister Christine and the name of the
[1:18:28] star was wormwood third part of the
[1:18:30] water listen we laugh but this is
[1:18:31] literally going to happen to this earth
[1:18:32] because the wrath of God because God
[1:18:34] because man has turned guard down this
[1:18:36] is what's going to happen and the fourth
[1:18:38] angel sounded now listen all these are
[1:18:41] sounding while those two prophets are on
[1:18:43] earth because we're going to read here
[1:18:46] in a minute
[1:18:47] we can will prove that the 144,000 are
[1:18:50] still here during that time the fourth
[1:18:53] angel sounded the third part of the Sun
[1:18:54] was smitten in the third part of the
[1:18:56] moon third part of the stars and so was
[1:18:58] the third part of them was darkened the
[1:19:00] day show not right here
[1:19:03] and heaven departed as a scroll in every
[1:19:05] mountain and he says right here the Sun
[1:19:07] became black back as sackcloth of hair
[1:19:09] I'm reading the seventh co6 sealed so
[1:19:12] the third part of them was darkened and
[1:19:13] the day shone not for a third part of it
[1:19:15] and the night lock once and I'll be held
[1:19:18] in her name jewel flying through the
[1:19:19] midst of heaven saying with a loud voice
[1:19:20] woe woe woe to the inhabitants of the
[1:19:24] earth by reason of the other voices of
[1:19:25] the trumpet of the three angels which
[1:19:27] are yet to sound remember that's four
[1:19:28] that's three more to sound all right now
[1:19:31] look brother branham told us he's what
[1:19:33] these woes were world war one world war
[1:19:37] two and world war three twos already
[1:19:40] sounded this one is sounded under all
[1:19:42] coming to this now you're that's World
[1:19:44] War one but you got to remember World
[1:19:46] War one ended but what did it begin
[1:19:49] it began up World War two World War two
[1:19:53] is going to begin World War three
[1:19:55] because what everything's in place man
[1:19:58] is placing things in different places
[1:20:00] and then what's going to happen World
[1:20:01] War One World War two and then we're not
[1:20:04] gonna be here for World War three the
[1:20:06] bride will be gone 144,000 they're going
[1:20:09] to be gone
[1:20:10] ain't that gonna be a horrible time
[1:20:12] because when 144,000 and to leave this
[1:20:14] earth no Holy Ghost no one no man with a
[1:20:18] Christian born-again soul will be on
[1:20:23] this earth out of seven billion which
[1:20:25] probably won't be but about four billion
[1:20:27] once this is all over with there'll be
[1:20:30] that many people on earth and not one
[1:20:32] will be a Christian not one and I beheld
[1:20:38] and heard an angel flying through the
[1:20:39] midst of heaven saying with a loud voice
[1:20:41] woe woe woe to the inhabitants of the
[1:20:42] earth by reason of the other voices of
[1:20:44] the trumpet of the three angels which
[1:20:46] are yet to sound listen continue and the
[1:20:51] fifth angel sounded and I saw a star
[1:20:53] fall from heaven unto the earth and to
[1:20:54] him was given the key of the bottomless
[1:20:56] pit this one's got a key and he opened
[1:20:58] the bottomless pit and there arose a
[1:21:00] smoke out of the pit
[1:21:01] now watch the bottomless pit he'll write
[1:21:04] the bottomless pit as hell all right and
[1:21:07] he opened the bottomless pit and there
[1:21:09] arose a smoke out of the pit as the
[1:21:11] smoke of a great furnace and the Sun and
[1:21:12] the air were darkened by reason of the
[1:21:14] smoke of the pit and there
[1:21:16] out of the smoke locusts upon the earth
[1:21:18] and to them was given power as the
[1:21:20] Scorpions of the earth have power
[1:21:22] anybody ever been bit by a scorpion yeah
[1:21:25] it feels good done it and it was
[1:21:30] commanded them that they should not hurt
[1:21:31] the grass of the earth neither any green
[1:21:32] thing to any tree but only those men
[1:21:35] which have not the seal of God in their
[1:21:38] forehead there's only one group of
[1:21:40] people during this period of time that
[1:21:43] has the seal of Gardner for you which is
[1:21:45] the holy ghost
[1:21:45] that's the 144,000 and - so there they
[1:21:49] are they're here during this whole time
[1:21:51] well we know that what the Bible is
[1:21:52] telling us is hurt everybody
[1:21:55] but those 144,000 and - yeah you can
[1:21:59] hurt everybody you won't - but them and
[1:22:01] to them it was given that they should
[1:22:03] not kill them but that they should be
[1:22:04] tormented five months in their torment
[1:22:06] was as the torment of a scorpion when he
[1:22:08] struck at the man and in those days
[1:22:10] shall men seek death and shall not find
[1:22:12] it and shall desire to die and death
[1:22:13] shall flee from them and the shapes of
[1:22:16] the locusts were like unto horses
[1:22:17] prepared unto battle and on their heads
[1:22:19] were as it were crowns like gold and
[1:22:21] their face was the faces of men and they
[1:22:23] had hair as the hair of women you know
[1:22:25] what brother Graham said about that
[1:22:26] anybody know what he said about that he
[1:22:29] said that's him alone he's tormenting
[1:22:30] them long-haired men and the short
[1:22:34] haired women
[1:22:34] I put the long-haired meaning because it
[1:22:38] is and the short haired women he said
[1:22:39] that's give them for their torment and
[1:22:41] their teeth as the teeth of lines and
[1:22:44] they had breastplates as it were
[1:22:46] breastplates of iron and sound of their
[1:22:48] wings was as the sound of chariots and
[1:22:50] many horses running to battle you think
[1:22:51] maybe that's a war fixing to happen to
[1:22:52] helicopters and airplanes we'll say well
[1:23:00] we won't see but maybe somebody tell us
[1:23:02] about it
[1:23:04] many horses running to battle and they
[1:23:06] had tails like in the scorpions and
[1:23:08] there were stings on their tails and
[1:23:09] their power was to hurt me in five
[1:23:10] months and they had a king over them
[1:23:12] which was the Angel of the bottomless
[1:23:14] pit so who is that that's the old devil
[1:23:18] but he's incarnate now and the Pope
[1:23:22] because remember this is during that
[1:23:24] time when woe is past and behold there
[1:23:27] come two woes more Hereafter
[1:23:29] all right
[1:23:29] let's read what brother branham said
[1:23:31] about this and then we'll close piece of
[1:23:34] the trumpet
[1:23:35] now this calling of the Feast of
[1:23:38] Trumpets the approaching of something
[1:23:39] notice revelations 8 7 if you want to
[1:23:41] write it down we noticed the first
[1:23:43] trumpet they're scattered hail blood
[1:23:45] fire upon the earth just exactly with
[1:23:47] exodus when God was calling his people
[1:23:49] out of the Exodus everybody understand
[1:23:52] that saying ma'am that's when Israel was
[1:23:54] in Egypt and all these plagues fell
[1:23:58] before they left all right same way it's
[1:24:01] going to happen to his people again all
[1:24:02] these plagues are going to happen before
[1:24:04] he takes his people all right now the
[1:24:07] reason that these seven trumpets there's
[1:24:09] not applied to this church and this age
[1:24:12] is because it's the Israel only it's the
[1:24:15] calling of the gathering of the people
[1:24:17] through the two witnesses and now
[1:24:20] there's only one significance in here
[1:24:22] that I want you to get to in a few
[1:24:23] minutes is where you'll see why this
[1:24:25] doesn't apply to these days that we're
[1:24:27] living in the seven trumpets the
[1:24:30] gathering of Israel is the trumpet the
[1:24:33] trumpets is to gather Israel notice the
[1:24:36] very first trumpet sound blood fire hail
[1:24:38] and everything scattered the ground what
[1:24:39] is he doing bringing Israel out of
[1:24:41] spiritual Egypt back into his homeland
[1:24:44] that's what happened to you that's what
[1:24:48] happened to you oh did you come in in
[1:24:51] the flower bed of these whether they're
[1:24:52] just a real wonderful thing when you
[1:24:54] came to the Lord yeah it was a wonderful
[1:24:57] thing when he came to the Lord the boy
[1:24:58] afterwards getting this gracious they
[1:25:03] wasn't days you felt like that was
[1:25:05] breaking loose on you if you hadn't you
[1:25:07] got it coming now let me say this right
[1:25:11] here cuz look I what calls Israel back
[1:25:16] to the homeland the trumpet what called
[1:25:19] us back to our homeland our homeland is
[1:25:21] not a place our homeland is the Word of
[1:25:24] God he caught the trumpet sounds to call
[1:25:28] us back to the Word of God alright now
[1:25:31] let me see right here every trumpet that
[1:25:32] blowed blown under the sixth seal we'll
[1:25:35] get to in a few minutes where we caught
[1:25:36] the seal all the trumpets sounded under
[1:25:38] the sixth seal alright let's go to
[1:25:40] number eight still in the Feast of the
[1:25:43] trumpet
[1:25:43] notice the trumpet sounded and that was
[1:25:45] to gather them together now the first
[1:25:47] trumpet blow there was hail fire sprayed
[1:25:49] upon the earth just exactly like it
[1:25:51] wasn't Egypt make it ready to call them
[1:25:52] to the Day of Atonement they rejected
[1:25:56] the true atonement we just talked about
[1:25:58] that they rejected Calvary that was a
[1:26:01] true atonement listen that was a day of
[1:26:03] atonement back in the Old Testament that
[1:26:05] was a type that was a type called our
[1:26:11] day of atonement we reject they rejected
[1:26:14] the true atonement and this year has
[1:26:16] been linked these years has been
[1:26:19] lengthened out through has been the year
[1:26:20] of Pentecost
[1:26:21] so what's he saying we had Pentecost
[1:26:24] right here look
[1:26:25] we had Pentecost 50 days after Jesus
[1:26:27] died ascended come back on the day of
[1:26:30] Pentecost
[1:26:31] just went to the Jews they rejected this
[1:26:36] but they got to come to their feast of
[1:26:38] Pentecost but we've lived it's been a
[1:26:40] Pentecost all the way through 2,000
[1:26:42] years of seven Church ages amen
[1:26:49] they've not had theirs so what they're
[1:26:53] going to do the two prophets are going
[1:26:54] to call them into the feast of Pentecost
[1:26:57] before they can receive the atonement
[1:27:00] they can't just mourn for for Jesus and
[1:27:03] don't know who he is they don't know who
[1:27:05] he is now but when they have their
[1:27:08] Pentecost when that man comes into their
[1:27:10] soul and then they call them to the
[1:27:13] feast of atonement where they they say
[1:27:15] oh my gosh we're in trouble
[1:27:16] we killed the very Masada we've been
[1:27:18] looking for and he says don't worry so
[1:27:22] where'd you get those scars he said in
[1:27:23] the house of my friends this has been
[1:27:25] the calling out of the church
[1:27:27] I'm sorry this years has been lengthened
[1:27:30] out through here has been the year of
[1:27:32] Pentecost II now sound now sounding for
[1:27:35] the Jews comes next
[1:27:37] God's not dealt with the Jews during
[1:27:39] this whole 2,000 years of church ages
[1:27:41] sure there's been some natural Jews come
[1:27:43] in sure but not the nation of Israel but
[1:27:46] he's getting ready to deal with them
[1:27:49] through two prophets what's God doing in
[1:27:53] the end time dealing with last - a
[1:27:55] prophet
[1:27:56] the Prophet the Lord Jesus Christ D
[1:27:59] profit I think about what Roosevelt was
[1:28:02] talking about you know the son of man
[1:28:05] denotes one person right
[1:28:08] I know collectively were the body but
[1:28:11] there was only one man that wasn't born
[1:28:13] from another man we're all sons we're
[1:28:18] all sons that were born from another man
[1:28:22] you understand what I mean I see a seed
[1:28:25] from an individual man brought into the
[1:28:28] bed and ground of the woman and then the
[1:28:30] son of man didn't have an earthly father
[1:28:35] so he's the son of man but now when
[1:28:40] you're born again and your bodies change
[1:28:44] you don't have an earthly father you
[1:28:48] know brother Branham said I'm not the
[1:28:49] son of Charles and Ella Brenham not
[1:28:52] denying his natural birth but he saw
[1:28:54] where his birth really took him to so I
[1:28:58] said that's just a point there just want
[1:29:00] to throw that in this has been the
[1:29:02] calling out of the church what's real
[1:29:03] close now which afterwards he took them
[1:29:05] to the land of promise which he took
[1:29:07] them to the promised land which he will
[1:29:08] do the same thing which in symbol he
[1:29:11] takes the church to the land of promise
[1:29:12] remember he takes us to the land of
[1:29:14] promise
[1:29:15] we're in Canaan but we got to fight for
[1:29:17] every inch on the ground that we got we
[1:29:19] gotta fight for it so will Israel
[1:29:21] alright let's go let's read another one
[1:29:23] number 9 I think this is the last one
[1:29:26] and then we'll then we'll stop note in
[1:29:29] Revelations tonight chapter xiii first
[1:29:31] now notice real close under the 6th
[1:29:33] trumpet revelations 9 13 under the 6th
[1:29:35] trumpet note there were two hundred
[1:29:37] thousand thousand of this is the 6th
[1:29:39] trumpet under the 6th trumpet right
[1:29:45] there were two hundred thousand horsemen
[1:29:48] is really two hundred thousand thousand
[1:29:50] horsemen that had been bound in the
[1:29:52] river of Euphrates was turned loose
[1:29:54] under the 6th trumpet now there's not
[1:29:57] two hundred thousand horsemen in the
[1:29:59] world but there are two hundred thousand
[1:30:01] horsemen I want you to jot this down so
[1:30:04] you can read it they weren't natural
[1:30:06] horses they breathe fire they had
[1:30:08] breastplates of jazz
[1:30:10] when they had tails in the end of their
[1:30:11] tail look like a serpent a snake's head
[1:30:13] on the end of a sting and see it was
[1:30:15] spiritual horses spiritual Devils
[1:30:18] Chargers that had been bound in
[1:30:20] Euphrates all these years supernatural
[1:30:22] demons what was it the old Roman Empire
[1:30:25] being revived the persecution of the
[1:30:30] Jews they had been bound for nearly
[1:30:32] 2,000 years at the river Euphrates can't
[1:30:35] cross to the promised land remember that
[1:30:39] boy this is wonderful
[1:30:41] remember the Tigris and Euphrates River
[1:30:43] runs right through where the Garden of
[1:30:46] Eden they couldn't cross over because of
[1:30:51] these demons you and I cross over into
[1:30:54] that Promised Land the Garden of Eden
[1:30:56] what brother I'm saying him in the cross
[1:30:58] mr. Gardner Bale the threefold purpose
[1:31:01] to take us where take us a bite to eat
[1:31:03] that was the last one take us back to
[1:31:05] the Garden of Eden
[1:31:06] Euphrates you know came to Eden I just
[1:31:09] did that can't cross the proper
[1:31:11] religious state that was trying to get
[1:31:12] to the other side Euphrates you know
[1:31:15] come through Eden but they were bound
[1:31:17] there two hundred thousand demons of
[1:31:18] persecution and notice what happened
[1:31:20] under that sixth trumpet they were
[1:31:22] turned loose on the Jews the persecution
[1:31:24] of the Jews supernatural Devils nearly
[1:31:27] 2,000 years then loosed by Stalin Hitler
[1:31:29] upon the Jews you said well that isn't
[1:31:31] Rome it's the same spirit they'd done
[1:31:34] the same thing they did to the
[1:31:36] Christians in the old pagan Roman days
[1:31:37] now watch the natural Israel and the
[1:31:39] spiritual church now as we separated
[1:31:42] here turned loose on the Jews now we
[1:31:44] know he can - that that quote continues
[1:31:46] oh but I wanted to stop right there for
[1:31:48] save time because of one region
[1:31:49] something else real quick right here
[1:31:51] they don't have this but if they can
[1:31:52] pick it up we were at you were asking
[1:31:55] some of you were looking a little
[1:31:56] stranger and brother Brown said this
[1:31:58] 1960 - is this a sign of the answer
[1:32:00] brother Brown said the sounding of the
[1:32:02] trumpet means gospel trumpet and the
[1:32:05] sounding of the trumpet in the Bible
[1:32:06] means get ready for a scriptural war
[1:32:10] scriptural war Paul said if you want to
[1:32:13] put this down first Corinthians 14 8 if
[1:32:15] the trumpet give an uncertain sound how
[1:32:17] will they man know what to prepare for
[1:32:19] and if it doesn't have a scriptural
[1:32:21] sound a vindicated
[1:32:23] indication of the Word of God made
[1:32:25] manifest how will we know where at the
[1:32:28] end time we've had that trumpet we know
[1:32:32] where we are
[1:32:33] Israel does not know where they are the
[1:32:36] world doesn't know where they are
[1:32:38] denominations don't know where they are
[1:32:40] we're the only people that have an
[1:32:43] absolute North Point and we're headed to
[1:32:47] that this is finally in 1962 paragraph
[1:32:52] 269 notice if it gives an uncertain
[1:32:54] sound unscriptural who can prepare
[1:32:57] himself but a trumpet did you notice
[1:33:00] each one of these ages that I told you
[1:33:02] about the church coming in there was a
[1:33:03] trumpet sounded a seal tore loose and a
[1:33:06] trumpet means war it fit don't give a
[1:33:11] scriptural sound what about it now Feast
[1:33:13] of the trumpets I'm going to read this
[1:33:14] real quick no more closed musicians come
[1:33:16] up piece of the trumpets 1964 paragraph
[1:33:21] 155 notice now exactly the continuty
[1:33:25] continuity of the scripture is actually
[1:33:27] the same under the seventh trumpet is to
[1:33:29] Israel the same as the seventh seal was
[1:33:31] to the church we find under the seventh
[1:33:34] seal that when those souls that were
[1:33:36] under the altar they receive robes they
[1:33:38] were given robes not that they learned
[1:33:39] them because they were in dispensation
[1:33:41] when God was still dealing with grace
[1:33:42] with the Gentiles not the Jews Israel is
[1:33:45] saved as a nation God deals with Israel
[1:33:47] as a nation Gentiles is a people
[1:33:51] all right Feast of the trumpets
[1:33:53] paragraph 222 see the atonement watch
[1:33:56] the atonement followed the trumpet sound
[1:33:58] they're gonna have to hear those two
[1:34:00] prophets that trumpet has got a sound
[1:34:02] they've got to hear the word of God to
[1:34:04] realize that the atonement has already
[1:34:07] been made the man so that's what they're
[1:34:10] going to preach you said one of them two
[1:34:11] prophets going to preach they're gonna
[1:34:12] preach Jesus Christ they gonna preach
[1:34:15] the Word of God they're going to preach
[1:34:16] they're not going to silver and bash
[1:34:18] their head and so how you miss it you
[1:34:19] bunch of dummies know they know they
[1:34:21] said hey your time is now this is just
[1:34:25] for you you know what if I was one of
[1:34:27] them two problems I jump up on the
[1:34:28] highest mountain I'd say come up here
[1:34:29] with me look all over the world there's
[1:34:31] nobody
[1:34:33] laughs but you know buddy Rome's not
[1:34:38] gonna get it they're gonna persecute you
[1:34:40] in other words but you're it you are
[1:34:45] 12,000 out of 12 tribes that's gonna get
[1:34:48] this message and that we're gonna leave
[1:34:51] this place don't worry Church we're
[1:34:54] going to leave this place
[1:34:56] whatever persecutions come and let it
[1:34:58] come but we're going to leave this place
[1:35:01] now look paragraph to 24 now the
[1:35:04] trumpets is to call them by it let's
[1:35:06] stand to our feet the purpose is to call
[1:35:08] them back to that atonement see the
[1:35:10] atonement they rejected and they
[1:35:12] rejected so that our eyes could be open
[1:35:15] theirs was closed and during this time
[1:35:18] those seals opened up and the trumpets
[1:35:21] blow and now in the blowing of the
[1:35:23] trumpets just before the Messiah comes
[1:35:26] because we've got to be and they've got
[1:35:29] to be in Palestine and you remember God
[1:35:32] had to harden Pharaoh's heart that's the
[1:35:34] same thing he done with Stalin and
[1:35:35] Hitler he hardened their heart to drive
[1:35:38] the Jews back to the homeland where the
[1:35:42] 144,000 is supposed to be let's listen
[1:35:46] one more from the rapture 1965 the
[1:35:49] message calls the bride together the
[1:35:53] shout and the trumpet the same one with
[1:35:56] a loud voice he screamed out with a
[1:35:57] shout in the voice in won't Lazarus and
[1:35:59] was a loud voice he cried Lazarus come
[1:36:02] forth and the voice Waits
[1:36:05] the sleeping bride the sleeping dead and
[1:36:09] the trumpet with the sound of the
[1:36:10] trumpet and when it does it calls always
[1:36:14] a trumpet called Israel to the feast of
[1:36:16] the trumpets which was a Pentecostal
[1:36:19] feast the great feast in the sky and the
[1:36:22] Feast of Trumpets now trumpet trumpet do
[1:36:26] announcer calling together
[1:36:27] now watch the assembling together the
[1:36:30] bride the feast of the trumpets the
[1:36:31] wedding supper we have seen it in time
[1:36:34] and I'm going to tell you you're gonna
[1:36:38] see it in its fullness and then
[1:36:41] there's your trumpets we'll go through
[1:36:45] the last three again because I want to
[1:36:47] get to that to that sixth trumpet again
[1:36:49] with the two hundred thousand thousand
[1:36:51] demons but listen we're living we're
[1:36:55] living in a great day we're living in a
[1:36:58] time where we should hardly have any
[1:37:01] questions about anything if you'll just
[1:37:04] study a little bit how in the world can
[1:37:07] God bring confusion how if you're
[1:37:12] confused it's not God that's pretty
[1:37:16] simple if you're confused about what I
[1:37:19] just said pray God said if you got the
[1:37:22] Holy Ghost I'll show you things to come
[1:37:25] I'll show you the word and if Brit
[1:37:29] listen if brother Branham preached it I
[1:37:31] believe we can preach it if he preached
[1:37:35] it it's not an exclusion we're included
[1:37:39] in this and we ought to be able to
[1:37:41] understand it I know nobody understood
[1:37:43] it while he was preaching it but he said
[1:37:46] they'd be a group that would they'd be
[1:37:48] some people standing in the endtime that
[1:37:49] would understand what's going on the
[1:37:51] seals would would open to us in its
[1:37:54] spiritual form it didn't back then that
[1:38:00] made to a prophet but it didn't he
[1:38:02] didn't have he didn't even have 104 much
[1:38:04] less 144,000 maybe maybe we maybe we
[1:38:12] shouldn't be have big heads never but we
[1:38:17] should realize that it's got to come
[1:38:20] through you this message has to made a
[1:38:23] life be made alive like I said last
[1:38:25] Sunday when Christ was on earth sure he
[1:38:27] had a physical flesh body but he had no
[1:38:30] church body he had no body he was the
[1:38:36] head but he had no body he had to come
[1:38:40] back in spirit form to build a body now
[1:38:44] he's got a body and now the head can
[1:38:46] come down on that body connect and take
[1:38:49] us out of here let's sing a song 3:11
