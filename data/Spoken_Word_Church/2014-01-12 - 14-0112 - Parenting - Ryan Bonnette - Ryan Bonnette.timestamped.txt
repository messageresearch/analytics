[0:25] good morning boys and girls
[0:28] morning you're on God's time
[0:34] okay today we're going to talk
[0:37] about
[0:39] parenting so take one of these and pass
[0:41] it around y this is the first thing when
[0:46] brother W asked me teach Sunday school
[0:48] this is the first thing that came to
[0:49] mind I prayed and ask the Lord to lead
[0:51] me I had studied on other things because
[0:53] I knew eventually my time might come
[0:56] so had other things more kind of
[0:59] prepared but this this is what the Lord
[1:00] I think laid on my heart to talk
[1:03] about not parenting so much our children
[1:06] but God parenting
[1:08] us
[1:13] about
[1:20] yous like
[1:25] it should have a few extra I
[1:28] think
[1:37] yeah we could we used to but it is
[1:42] on
[1:44] okay well what I started thinking about
[1:46] was like I said how that God is our
[1:49] parent and the way that we parent our
[1:52] children you can see and think about and
[1:56] understand how God Parents us can
[1:58] everybody hear me yes okay I've got this
[2:02] microphone on but it's not boosting me
[2:04] at all I'm I'm okay don't get low just
[2:08] stay
[2:09] up can um let's open with a word of
[2:13] prayer our heavenly father we thank you
[2:16] for the opportunity to gather today in
[2:18] Your Name Lord and we pray that
[2:20] everything that is said and done today
[2:21] during the service and during the Sunday
[2:23] schools that have all be For Your Glory
[2:24] and Honor we pray just unfold your word
[2:27] to us Lord give us understanding of you
[2:29] and just help me to step aside and allow
[2:31] you to speak what you've uh given me
[2:34] through me Lord just use my lips I
[2:36] praying we love you and thank you for
[2:37] all your many blessings and thank you
[2:39] that you are our father and for the
[2:42] realization of that in Jesus name
[2:46] amen all right starting with number one
[2:48] on our on my notes God is our father we
[2:52] all know that God is the father or
[2:54] progenitor of all mankind but especially
[2:57] of we who are born again now that's that
[3:00] statement I'm what I'm saying
[3:02] is that God by creation you know he
[3:05] created all of us so we're all his
[3:08] children in that
[3:09] respect but specifically when we're born
[3:12] again we begin to know God as our father
[3:17] and I did I couldn't find any scriptures
[3:20] or quotes to back that up I'm just
[3:21] saying that by creation you know we are
[3:24] all the children of God so
[3:27] uh Part B scripture tells us that things
[3:30] of God can be understood by the things
[3:32] that we see Romans 1:20 y'all don't have
[3:35] to turn that I'll just read
[3:37] itang
[3:48] second
[3:52] okay for the invisible things of him
[3:54] from the creation of the world are
[3:55] clearly seen being understood by the
[3:57] things that are made even his his
[4:00] eternal power and godhead so that they
[4:03] are without
[4:05] excuse so we see the creation is a
[4:09] reflection of the Creator
[4:12] and in this case you know we see God in
[4:14] nature we see God in the pyramids and we
[4:17] see him in the
[4:18] Zodiac when God when from Elohim came
[4:22] out the logos and brother Bram said he
[4:24] saw the logos as or you could uh picture
[4:27] him as being you know like a child
[4:28] playing before the father's doorstep he
[4:30] began creating began unfolding and
[4:33] everything he made is just a reflection
[4:35] of him and so that we can see him so we
[4:37] have some understanding of what he is
[4:40] and I think that's why God put us here
[4:42] in these relationships that we're in in
[4:43] marriage and in uh fatherhood and you
[4:47] know parenting so that we can see a
[4:49] reflection of God by those things we can
[4:51] understand why he does what he does by
[4:53] me having kids now I can understand why
[4:56] God does the things he does to me does
[4:59] that make sense
[5:01] okay and God helps us to see him I
[5:03] skipped one one part here I'm going to
[5:05] go back to number one to elaborate on
[5:07] God as our father we know that God as
[5:10] Elohim he desired to have a family he
[5:13] wanted to condescend and wanted to be
[5:15] understood he wanted to be worshiped and
[5:20] he wanted to uh to have a
[5:24] family uh God's provider approach to
[5:27] Divine Fellowship 1966
[5:30] brother bam said God loves to fellowship
[5:32] with his creature in the Garden of Eden
[5:34] we are told that when a man walked in
[5:38] the uprightness of God God came down in
[5:40] the cool of the evening and fellowship
[5:42] with his children Adam and Eve he came
[5:44] down and fellowship with them I think of
[5:47] when I'm at work I'm all the time
[5:48] thinking about my children I can't wait
[5:50] to get home and fellowship with them and
[5:52] anytime I'm feeling lonely I'm alone 80%
[5:56] of the day you know
[5:57] driving and when I feel lonely I just
[6:00] start thinking about my kids or my wife
[6:02] and just the you know their little
[6:03] mannerisms and the cute things they do
[6:05] and it just cheers me up I think God was
[6:08] that way before the world he he saw us
[6:10] he knew what we would be before he
[6:12] created us and he desired to have
[6:14] fellowship with us he wanted to bring
[6:15] bring us into full manifestation so he
[6:17] could have fellowship with
[6:22] us
[6:24] uh so again I'll say uh Part B there
[6:28] I'll finish reading that when we
[6:29] understand God attributes better when we
[6:30] observe our relationships and life and
[6:33] like I mentioned briefly marriage me
[6:35] being a husband now when I look at my
[6:38] wife I can see how God will look at his
[6:41] bride and how God desired before he you
[6:45] know before I had a bride I desired to
[6:47] have a bride I was lonely I wanted a
[6:48] companion and I can see how God will do
[6:51] all that he does all that he has done to
[6:53] get a bride you know he'll go to just
[6:56] any measure to get a bride and
[7:00] how that um and then she just the
[7:02] opposite she can see she's a bride she
[7:04] can see how that God uh longs to or how
[7:09] that a bride would long to have a a
[7:10] bridegroom to fellowship with and to and
[7:14] to protect her and provide for and care
[7:15] for and all those things so we see these
[7:18] relationships we see that little piece
[7:20] of God we can understand a little bit
[7:24] better that part of God number
[7:28] two good parenting techniques now these
[7:30] are just four things a b c and d those
[7:33] are four things that I thought of that
[7:35] I've seen in my experience and both uh
[7:37] being raised as a child and then and
[7:39] then raising children and then more
[7:41] importantly my spiritual walk and being
[7:44] raised as a child of God I see these
[7:47] things that these four things now these
[7:49] were not all the things I mean and at
[7:50] the end we'll have a group discussion
[7:52] and y'all can mention some more of these
[7:53] if y'all can think of any but these are
[7:55] four ones that I've thought of just from
[7:58] my own experience and I don't have a lot
[8:00] of scriptures to back up some of these
[8:01] it's nothing more than just my
[8:03] experience coming in to be born again
[8:05] coming into the bride or into the body
[8:08] our day nourishing when a baby is born
[8:12] we parents nourish him by feeding him
[8:14] clothing him and providing for him in
[8:16] every way he may need it we quote
[8:18] unquote baby him during this time in his
[8:22] life okay so in a
[8:24] sense God also does this for newborn
[8:27] babies in Christ he pours out blessings
[8:29] we nearly can't contain fills us with
[8:31] the Holy Spirit clothes us with his
[8:33] righteousness reveals truths to us one
[8:35] after another Etc and again that was my
[8:38] experience when I came to the message um
[8:41] most of you know my story I was going to
[8:43] North Hall High School I was a Baptist
[8:45] raise a Baptist and um uh Sister Amy
[8:50] brother Joe's daughter uh she and I
[8:51] crossed paths and she and I dated for a
[8:54] while and she came to church with me at
[8:56] Corinth Baptist Church in Gainesville
[8:58] for a while couple of times I mean and
[9:00] then after a while uh she she said well
[9:03] now I'll come to church with you why
[9:04] can't you come to church with me so I
[9:06] said okay well I mean I really didn't
[9:07] want to I was really hesitant to but at
[9:10] some point along the way uh I think it
[9:12] was uh that meeting that brother jail
[9:14] hosted in 2002 brother a bisc preach
[9:17] there some of yall remember that that
[9:19] was my first time in a message service I
[9:22] came to that because I thought well it's
[9:23] outside of the church you know and I was
[9:25] afraid to come here I thought
[9:26] everybody's just going to surround me
[9:28] and and you know uh indoctrinate me and
[9:31] I just I didn't want to be surrounded
[9:33] that way so I mean I'd be outnumbered so
[9:36] I thought well gean Mountain Center nice
[9:38] open place I can get out whatever you
[9:40] know so well I'm more comfortable in
[9:43] that environment so I went there and I
[9:46] was amazed and what I saw I mean people
[9:49] standing up shouting and Amen brother
[9:51] and right up under the preacher yelling
[9:53] at the preacher I thought what are y'all
[9:54] doing I was like brother man this is a
[9:56] good church man so uh he first saw
[9:59] things like
[10:02] that but eventually though because I saw
[10:05] everything was kind of okay yall are all
[10:07] pretty tame I said well I'll start
[10:09] coming to church there for a little
[10:10] while and see and the Lord began to
[10:12] catch me catch my attention and get a
[10:14] hold of and it began to show me things
[10:17] and from there it started just one thing
[10:19] after another for the first few years I
[10:21] guess it was just constantly unfolding
[10:24] things you know and the simple things
[10:25] the milk of the word the one God water
[10:28] baptism and all these really simplistic
[10:31] things that well now we look at as
[10:32] simple but back then I was just appalled
[10:34] and I said Lord this is amazing and
[10:36] where was I when I was reading my Bible
[10:38] before as a Baptist I was reading my
[10:40] Bible every day as a 15-year-old Baptist
[10:42] kid up till I was 17 at this time I read
[10:46] over these things over and over again
[10:48] never
[10:49] saw and and the serpent seed and all
[10:52] those things so for a while when we come
[10:55] to the New Birth God babies us and he
[10:57] keeps Ching Little Things to just you
[10:59] know help us to grow but just it's just
[11:02] milk it's just simple things we can't
[11:03] handle the strong meat
[11:07] work and
[11:11] then really can't
[11:14] contain oh let's see now Part B training
[11:19] as he gets older a child is weaned from
[11:21] the breast and given solid food he
[11:23] begins to take on more responsibility
[11:25] and becomes more
[11:28] independent begins to learn the word no
[11:32] you're not told that as an infant and it
[11:34] seems like to me when I came into the
[11:36] message you know everything when I was a
[11:38] baby in Christ everything I asked for
[11:40] seemed like God gave it to me you know
[11:41] for a time there it seemed like just
[11:44] constantly uh the answer was yes or the
[11:46] answer was you know he was always just
[11:48] giving me these things and revealing the
[11:49] word to me one thing after
[11:52] another but at some point when you
[11:55] mature you have to start to learn the
[11:57] word no God answer sometimes is no when
[12:01] we reach this stage as Christians we
[12:04] begin to eat more strong meat of the
[12:06] word and many of the blessings of God
[12:08] that want flutter Our Lives seem to
[12:10] cease God no longer babies us he wants
[12:14] us to become mature adult Christians
[12:16] seasoned in the
[12:19] gospel
[12:21] so I guess I'll go ahead and read a few
[12:24] of these notes here
[12:25] now this is a question I've asked about
[12:27] in the Bible study some of yall this
[12:29] last Bible study I I asked brother Dell
[12:32] I pretty well knew what his answer was
[12:33] going to be I just kind of wanted to get
[12:34] some more insight and maybe
[12:36] understanding about why is it that for
[12:38] that short few first few years y'all
[12:40] remember I had a ton of questions you
[12:42] know for the first few years coming into
[12:45] the message I I just asked one after
[12:46] another 10 questions at every Bible
[12:48] study and now I study more than I did
[12:51] then and I don't have many questions and
[12:52] it's not because I know everything it's
[12:54] just I think what's happening is then I
[12:57] was getting the milk of the work and
[12:59] just you know little things here and
[13:00] there just constantly left and right
[13:02] Revelation but now getting into more
[13:04] strong me it takes a while to chew you
[13:07] know sometimes things come Progressive
[13:09] and slow and it just seems almost like
[13:12] you're just dried up but really you're
[13:13] making yourself available to God you're
[13:15] praying reading your Bible and studying
[13:17] listening to sermons come to church and
[13:19] making yourself totally available but
[13:21] yet where's the blessings that want to
[13:22] flow well that's one thing I can say is
[13:25] that uh maybe I'm not getting the milk
[13:27] of the work now I'm getting strong meat
[13:29] and it comes slowly and progressively
[13:32] that's how brother Dale brings it slow
[13:33] in progression and that's the way we
[13:36] need it as as we're
[13:40] maturing
[13:44] so uh in separation from unbelief uh
[13:47] 5502 28 brother Bram said sometimes God
[13:50] gives you trials did you ever know that
[13:54] give you some child training or get you
[13:56] all fixed up sometimes like that just to
[13:59] see what you'll do about
[14:02] it and then Jehovah Gyra 57039 in the
[14:06] evening how God loves to test his people
[14:09] these aren't on yall SNES by the way
[14:10] this is something how God loves to test
[14:14] his people every child that comes to God
[14:16] must be tested child trained no
[14:19] exceptions everyone so there's no
[14:22] excuses that we all have to face that we
[14:25] all have to go through child training
[14:27] and maybe tonight you're sick
[14:29] oh excuse me and maybe tonight that
[14:31] you're sick in other words he's saying
[14:32] the reason you're sick maybe is just to
[14:35] have a little child training just a
[14:37] little testing don't be discouraged
[14:39] God's on the throne he knows all things
[14:42] if we're truly born of the spirit of God
[14:44] everything's working together for our
[14:47] good he's going to make everything right
[14:49] he promised he would he swore he would
[14:52] and he's got to keep that word he's kept
[14:54] it now for thousands of years on to
[14:57] every believer would you be be an
[14:59] exception no sir we're no exception now
[15:02] watch him
[15:05] now okay y'all can go ahead and turn to
[15:08] Hebrews 5 and just stay there I guess
[15:10] through the rest of the Sunday school
[15:14] I'll have so I'll have other scriptures
[15:15] to read but just a verse here and there
[15:17] so just stay on Hebrews 5 and while
[15:19] you're turning there uh you must be born
[15:21] again 61 12:31 the morning service what
[15:24] do you do where a baby as soon as it's
[15:27] born wash him is that right and as soon
[15:30] as a man has DED has died to himself and
[15:34] is born of God he's Washed by the Water
[15:37] of the word amen if it says Jesus name
[15:39] you say Jesus name says You must be born
[15:41] again you say the same thing every what
[15:43] God says you're washed by that water of
[15:45] the word amen now you're ready now for
[15:48] life you're ready to be started out now
[15:52] now you're born a new born in the family
[15:54] of God with a new parent that's what
[15:56] we're talking about
[15:57] parenting you you can't be born without
[15:59] having a parent so if you're born in the
[16:02] Brotherhood of a church that's what you
[16:05] got if you're born in a Creed there you
[16:07] are but if you're born in God conceived
[16:10] in his word you got a new parent that's
[16:12] God ready to make his word known Among
[16:15] Us with you speak it through you oh a
[16:18] new parent that parent is God he's ready
[16:20] to take his word
[16:22] now that he's already spoke and lay it
[16:25] in you and make it come to life see now
[16:28] you have your training now you're ready
[16:30] you're ready to go into training now
[16:31] child training that's the hard part when
[16:33] you think you ought to do this and the
[16:36] word Cuts you around and shows you
[16:37] something else why they believe that
[16:40] over that don't make any difference what
[16:42] they believe here's what God said you
[16:44] must be about the father's business now
[16:47] you're getting born again now you're
[16:48] getting right getting straightened out
[16:50] you have a new
[16:53] parent okay I'm going to read Proverbs
[16:56] 22:6 but stay on Hebrews right now we
[16:59] all know it is train up a child in the
[17:00] way he should go when he is old he'll
[17:02] not depart from it now my child training
[17:05] early on as a
[17:07] Baptist uh my mom and dad never really I
[17:11] don't remember them ever sitting me down
[17:13] and praying with me and reading we did
[17:14] do Family Bible readings but I don't
[17:16] think they ever really pray with me at
[17:17] night and things but my grandma my dad's
[17:20] mom she's always stood out of my mind
[17:23] because she sat down with me and my
[17:24] sister she'd have us each Pi a Bible
[17:26] story we'd read it every night we'd pray
[17:29] and like Dave Ramsey says more is caught
[17:31] than taught does that make sense in
[17:33] other words you teach your kids to read
[17:35] their Bible but if you don't they'll do
[17:38] what you do they will do what you say
[17:40] you know so more caught than taught so I
[17:43] would see my grandma read and pray in
[17:46] addition to her praying with us and that
[17:48] stuck with me and several years later I
[17:49] went astray from it this was when I was
[17:51] four or five but she did this with us
[17:53] and then 7 8 9 10 11 around there I I
[17:56] strayed from it for a while I didn't
[17:58] read my Bible today as a little kid of
[18:00] course but then around 12 13 years old I
[18:02] began to want to know more about God and
[18:05] I started reading my Bible and
[18:07] praying so see you train up a child and
[18:10] God does the same with us in our early
[18:12] Christian experience he trains us up and
[18:14] he and and the way to go so that we will
[18:18] not depart from it
[18:21] and uh Hebrews
[18:27] 57 uh who in the days of his flesh when
[18:30] he had offered up prayers and
[18:31] supplications was strong crying and
[18:32] tears to him that was able to save him
[18:35] from death and was heard and that he
[18:37] feared though he were a son yet learned
[18:39] he obedience by the things which he
[18:41] suffered you know God in flesh learned
[18:44] obedience by the things which he
[18:46] suffered and being made perfect he
[18:47] became the author of Eternal salvation
[18:49] unto all them that obey
[18:52] him and then skip down to verse
[18:56] 12 for when for the time you ought to be
[18:59] teachers you have need that one teach
[19:01] you again which be the first principles
[19:03] of the Oracles of God and are become
[19:06] such as have need of milk and not strong
[19:08] meat for everyone that useth milk is
[19:10] unskillful in the word of righteousness
[19:12] for he is a babe but strong meat belong
[19:15] to them that are of full age even those
[19:18] who by reason of use have their senses
[19:20] exercised to discern both good and
[19:24] evil okay and
[19:27] then just I guess continue to stay on
[19:30] Hebrews I think I've got yeah I've got
[19:31] another turn to Hebrews 12 if you want
[19:33] to turn there I'm going to read another
[19:36] scripture uh from James chapter 4 this
[19:40] is back in reference to God telling us
[19:41] no again um you lust and have not you
[19:46] kill and desire to have and cannot
[19:48] obtain you fight and War yet you have
[19:50] not because you ask not you ask and
[19:52] receive not because you ask a this that
[19:54] you may consume it upon your dust
[19:57] sometimes I think when we ask God for
[19:59] things and the answer is no we just
[20:01] don't want to take that we think either
[20:03] well it's I think the devil tells us
[20:05] this he tells me anyway that well I must
[20:07] have not had enough Faith well no the
[20:09] answer just might be no you know
[20:12] sometimes we just have to accept that
[20:14] when we ask God for things sometimes the
[20:16] answer is no and we just have to live
[20:18] with it
[20:20] so and it could be that we're asking
[20:22] them is we're asking maybe for the wrong
[20:27] thing
[20:29] okay so now part C down to chasing on
[20:33] your
[20:33] notes the most difficult part of
[20:36] parenting for both the parent and the
[20:38] child is chastening the child often does
[20:41] not understand why he has to be punished
[20:43] and he may feel betrayed or unloved by
[20:46] the parent however just the opposite is
[20:48] true we actually chasen our children out
[20:50] of love that's the reason we do it good
[20:53] parents must chasen their children or
[20:55] they will never learn to be obedient and
[20:57] disciplined God Chas chastens every
[20:59] child that comes to him he rebukes us
[21:01] and chastens us out of
[21:04] love now stay on Hebrews 12 but I'm
[21:07] going to read something else here
[21:08] Proverbs 23 withhold not correction from
[21:11] the child if thou beatest him with the
[21:13] rod he shall not die Thou shalt beat him
[21:16] with the rod and shalt deliver his soul
[21:18] from
[21:19] hell he that uh Proverbs 13:24 he that
[21:23] speaketh excuse me he that spareth his
[21:25] Rod hateth his son but he that loveth
[21:27] him Chase him the time and Proverbs
[21:32] 22:15 foolishness is bound in the heart
[21:35] of a child but the rod of Correction
[21:37] shall drive it far from
[21:39] you now Hebrews 12 verse
[21:44] 5 and you have forgotten the
[21:47] exhortation which speaketh unto you as
[21:49] unto children my son despise not thou
[21:51] the chastening of the Lord nor faint
[21:53] when thou art rebuked of him for whom
[21:56] the Lord loveth he chasteneth and sorth
[21:59] every son whom he receiveth if ye endure
[22:02] chastening God dealth with you as with
[22:04] sons for what son is he whom the father
[22:06] chasteneth
[22:08] not but if ye without chastisement where
[22:11] of all are
[22:13] partakers uh then are all bastards and
[22:15] not Sons furthermore we have had fathers
[22:18] of our flesh which corrected us and we
[22:20] gave them reverence shall we not much
[22:22] rather in be in subjection unto the
[22:24] father of spirits and live for they
[22:27] verely for a few days Chas us after
[22:29] their own
[22:30] pleasure but he for our profit that we
[22:33] might be partakers of his Holiness now
[22:36] no chastening for the present time seeth
[22:38] to be joyous but Grievious nevertheless
[22:41] afterward it yith the Peaceable fruit of
[22:43] righteousness unto them which are
[22:46] exercised
[22:50] thereby
[22:52] okay and then Part
[22:56] D leading throughout his entire
[22:59] childhood a child must be led he lacks
[23:02] experience and if not directed by a
[23:04] parent he will go
[23:06] astray in the same way we must be
[23:08] directed by God for our adversary's
[23:11] entire purpose is to see that we go
[23:13] astray thankfully God is Sovereign and
[23:16] all powerful and he knows how to lead us
[23:20] along
[23:27] okay y'all can turn to this one if you
[23:30] want to U oh no I'm sorry it's just one
[23:33] verse Psalm 37:23 the steps of a good
[23:35] man are ordered by the Lord and he
[23:38] delighteth in his way and then Psalm
[23:43] 9111 for he shall give his angels charge
[23:46] over thee to keep thee in all thy ways
[23:49] they shall bear thee up in their hands
[23:51] lest thou Dash thy foot against the
[23:57] stone
[24:01] okay uh let's see and thy seed shall
[24:04] possess the Gate of his enemies uh 1961
[24:07] to 12 in the evening and they let's see
[24:10] but you know it sometimes God lets it
[24:12] get that way to try you you can never
[24:15] Abraham would have never possessed the
[24:17] Gate of the enemy until he was tried
[24:20] first and you'll never possess the Gate
[24:22] of the enemy until you go through the
[24:24] trials some through the water some
[24:26] through the floods some through deep
[24:28] trials but all through the blood God
[24:30] leads his children see you must be first
[24:33] tried oh then the illegitimate falls in
[24:35] the trial but the true child of God
[24:37] stands true he knows where possession
[24:39] lays he knows where he's standing he
[24:42] knows what's happened to him he knows
[24:44] that he's pass from Death unto life and
[24:45] he knows that God answers
[24:48] prayer and then uh God hiding himself in
[24:51] Simplicity and 1963 or 3:17 in the
[24:54] morning is uh because that man was was
[24:58] made up in the beginning not to try to
[25:00] shift for himself a man was made to rely
[25:04] completely upon God as the reason we're
[25:06] liking un to Lambs or sheep a sheep
[25:08] cannot lead himself he has to have a
[25:11] leader and the holy spirit's supposed to
[25:13] lead us so man is made that way and God
[25:16] made all of his works so simple that the
[25:20] simple could understand it and God makes
[25:22] himself simple with the simple in order
[25:24] to be understood by the
[25:27] simple
[25:34] okay all right and I wanted to read
[25:37] these verses of this
[25:43] song Let's see you're in a whole another
[25:46] dimension I guess teaching Sunday school
[25:47] cuz time
[25:50] FES uh I'll just read this real quick
[25:53] God leads us along everybody knows this
[25:55] song in Shady Green pasture so rich and

[26:14] his dear children
[26:16] alone through sorrow though Sorrows
[26:18] befall us and Satan oppose God leads his
[26:20] dear children alone through Grace we can
[26:24] conquer defeat all our foes God leads

[26:39] fire but all through the blood some
[26:40] through great sorrow but God gives us s
[26:43] in the night season and all the day long
[26:45] if you ever heard me sing you know why I
[26:46] didn't sing that I just wanted to read
[26:48] it because it kept going through my mind
[26:50] as I Was preparing this message about
[26:51] parenting God leads us we're his
[26:54] children and quickly number three the
[26:57] group discussion what experiences in
[26:59] your life can you think of where God
[27:01] expressed his fatherhood attribute to
[27:02] you if you have another one to add to
[27:05] these four that I thought of or and I'll
[27:07] say this as an example this is kind of
[27:09] what I'm looking for back when I played
[27:11] rock and roll music I was a drummer in a
[27:13] rock band and uh obviously rock and roll
[27:16] music we know was wrong well I didn't
[27:19] know that I thought it was really
[27:20] pleasing to the Lord because we were
[27:21] playing Christian rock so brother Aaron
[27:23] preached Christian rock is a Croc and I
[27:26] thought well I I didn't like brother Aon
[27:28] during that time and but the Lord began
[27:31] to convict me and one day uh I was
[27:34] convicted this is just shortly after I
[27:36] started coming here I wasn't coming here
[27:37] very long and was still playing with
[27:38] that rock band and the Lord convicted me
[27:41] and I stopped right in the middle of her
[27:42] performance and walked backstage I said
[27:44] I I can't do this anymore all the band
[27:45] came out there with me and I said I just
[27:48] it was only in front of five or 10
[27:49] people it wasn't a big deal but uh
[27:52] that's the last ever played with but
[27:54] what happened is God chastised me he
[27:56] convicted me at first and said just put
[28:00] it down and I he knew I was too young to
[28:02] understand it just like I do with Ula we
[28:04] don't let her play with the electrical
[28:05] socket we know she'll get hurt she she
[28:07] wants to play with the electrical socket
[28:09] though so we just stop her and years to
[28:11] come she'll learn why it was wrong and
[28:12] years later I began to understand that
[28:14] there's a lustful demon associated with
[28:16] rock and roll music and many other wrong
[28:18] things associated with it so now I see
[28:21] what's wrong but at the time God just
[28:23] told me leave it alone so and I had to
[28:26] listen so uh does anybody have a
[28:29] something to add that something in your
[28:31] own experience where you've seen God
[28:33] expressed as a
[28:38] father Yes um I think protection from
[28:44] danger specifically protection from
[28:46] danger it was soon after I
[28:50] uh I I I had turned to the Lord and Tom
[28:54] and I were driving on 120 from marett to
[28:57] Rosell
[28:58] and a pickup truck on the other side of
[29:00] the road hit a concrete bridge Rail and
[29:04] a chunk of that came into Tomas radiator
[29:08] and 3 in above that would have been in
[29:10] his neck you know the truck somehow I
[29:14] didn't see it went over our car as we
[29:16] went under it and he slid along the
[29:18] right hand side and turned over in the
[29:21] creek but it didn't hit us at all and I
[29:24] when I after I after it all happened I
[29:27] realized Satan was trying to destroy me
[29:30] right there because he had his gun
[29:32] stained against someone coming to the
[29:34] Lord yeah and um it was his his absolute
[29:39] protection that kept us all alive yeah
[29:43] God's obligated to his children he
[29:44] protects us because we're his children
[29:47] so anybody
[29:48] else just like we give everything that
[29:52] TR our kid that they need God suppli all
[29:54] our needs all our wants and he protect
[29:58] she saying I mean I drive all the time
[30:00] Jack KN on getting on 85 285 and I bar
[30:05] had KN room please by so yeah little
[30:07] things that he does for us sometimes we
[30:09] don't thank him but we just thank him
[30:11] for everything that he does for us
[30:14] exactly reminds me of that brother
[30:17] brother Brenham said you fought your way
[30:19] here in church and when he was asked
[30:22] that was nothing I mean he just drove to
[30:24] church and he didn't see what would have
[30:27] taken place God protected
[30:32] him I got rear ended twice on the
[30:35] highway coming to church and and no not
[30:38] today but I mean when I was living in
[30:41] Atlanta and I was coming to church and
[30:44] got rear rended twice and got out of my
[30:46] car and there's not a a m a mark on I
[30:50] mean you know and I called on and I said
[30:53] well I'm probably going to be L I just
[30:55] got reared and I was just shaking and
[30:58] and I get I I'm in the media and in that
[31:02] little Aspire that you read and I
[31:04] thought oh my God you know it's got to
[31:07] be bashed in I get out and walk to the
[31:09] back of the car and not a scratch on the
[31:13] bumper and me the car hit me and knocked
[31:16] me into the Medan so I was like okay and
[31:20] so I cracked it up and car stopped and
[31:23] let me back on the highway and I made
[31:25] Church all time it was just like
[31:28] no I could believe it we have nothing to
[31:30] be afraid of cuz God's angels are
[31:34] always prot us we need to remember that
[31:37] with
[31:47] coming don't forget your
[31:49] camera
