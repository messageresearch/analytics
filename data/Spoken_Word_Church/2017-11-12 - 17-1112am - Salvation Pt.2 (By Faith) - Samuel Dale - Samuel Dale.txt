«  160       †          And the revelation is the only thing, the revelation of the Word. What is the... What is a revelation? Jesus said, "Upon this rock I'll build My Church, and the gates of hell can't prevail against It." Faith is a revelation; because Faith has been revealed to you.
161    "Abel, by Faith, offered by revelation (Faith), offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than that of Cain."
162    Cain thought they eat apples. They still got that idea, but it wasn't. It was an adultery, serpent's seed. And there when the Seven Seals opened, it declared it and proved it. My book is just out on it. Think, we have a thousand here now. See? Notice. That's Scripturally, from Genesis to Revelations.

4) 65-0725M  THE.ANOINTED.ONES.AT.THE.END.TIME_  JEFFERSONVILLE.IN  V-5 N-3  SUNDAY_
«  53       †          What is faith? Faith is something that's revealed to you; that is not yet, but you believe it will be. Faith is a revelation of the will of God. So, by revelation!
54    And the churches today don't even believe in spiritual revelation. They believe in a dogmatic teaching of some system. "By revelation Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than that of Cain, which God testified he was righteous." Amen. I hope you see that. See where we're living? See the hour?
I was talking to a--a gentleman not long ago, a Christian scholar and gentleman. He said, "Mr. Branham, we refuse all revelations."

«  105       †          Now, faith is "a revelation from God." Now, faith is a revelation. There's where I want to stay, there, just a moment. It's a revelation. He has revealed it to you by His grace. It's nothing you did. You didn't work yourself up into faith. You ever have faith, it's give to you by the grace of God. And God reveals it to you, therefore faith is a revelation. And the whole Church of God is...

the Lord if you'd like to turn in your scriptures turn to Jonah - we started we got a one-way from John and started on Jonah and started a series now on salvation so we'd be speaking on that for a while and then we'll go from Jonah - to go to Roman's four then just remember now brother Forney will be with us the Lord will in Wednesday ministering for us and just keeping him in your mind and the

because that way we won't we having to plant a thing of stopping to eat you know and I so remember that okay any other announcements you have all of the sheet the announcements and the things on it or the services from now to the first of the year so just remember that and keep it in your mind father we thank you for your grace and your love Lord and we thank you for everything we praise your great

have your way with us now and forgive our sins cleanse us from all unrighteousness and keep us in your love as we read your word you come and speak to each one of us Lord just God and direct us in Jesus name Amen Jonah - we'll just go to verse 9 and 10 so we went through the whole thing there last Sunday but notice he said but I will sacrifice now this is Jonah in the belly of the whale and he's come down through telling the things of where he was at and all that's lying vanities and he was looking to the Lord alright but I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of Thanksgiving I will pay that that I have vowed salvation is of the Lord and the Lord spake unto the feast and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land alright now let's go to Roman's I hope we get this far romans 4 what should we say then that Abraham our Father as pertaining to the flesh hath found for if Abraham were justified by works he had were of to glory but not before God for what saith the scripture know what says this they into our Bible Oh new no matter what what saith the scripture abraham believed god and it was counted unto him for righteousness you may be seated the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word now we have two announcements and so y'all have to get that part straight the Monaco's class we'll be meeting in the sanctuary at 12:45 all right so that's the practice but then we wound up getting another one it says boys and Monica's Sunday School classes is to meet in the afternoon or meet this afternoon in between the services and after second service so everybody get that straight so that you're going to be meeting between the services today and then your meeting after the services so you make sure and get that to where that you'll know where you're supposed to be another on the board's class in Monica's class right now we've read here and we see that the scripture firmly declares salvation is of the Lord all right now salvation is not of the Lord and man it is not something that you can do is not something that you could not do and merit or anything it's just plain language that salvation is of the Lord all right now what I've started is a series part on salvation that we want to you know get into and so we're back in the Old Testament now you know the way I do I bring everything back to the very groundwork and I begin it's a very beginning I don't just jump into something and take all I try to go all the way back and get to that point all right so then salvation Jonah said is of the Lord all right now we found that the word salvation there in Jonah is to live as well fire is prosperity or our victory and it comes from the word that's the same meaning as Joshua all right which goes back to your hova C which goes all the way back to Jesus Christ so we know that all will tie together and bring it out to the New Testament eventually but we're trying to stay in the Old Testament all right now the purpose is one thing if Hebrews 13:8 is correct and we do believe that then whatever salvation is in the Old Testament it will be in the new whatever it is in the new will be that of the old now there's a differential between the salvation right because of the way you've got it laid out and the way that it comes and what happens of the Old Testament and how that the blood of Jesus Christ was not dire if it was the blood of bulls and goats all right there's it you know we'll have to divide that as we come along but just remember it's the things that you base your salvation on today that's what they based their salvation on back directly and you said no no they put doesn't know they didn't have their salvation on the blood of bulls and gold they had their salvation of what God told them to do you know follow that and keep it in your mind it's what God told them to do more than just saying this that or the other you know but it'll all be based upon those time all right we went through talking about that to consider one thing it's used as deliverance in the olden deliverer deliverance in the new so no matter what you're talking about your thought is to have deliverance because that's what salvation is salvation is deliverance from the situation you're in so then that way the word salvation can apply as we said about Moses when he said stands to and see the salvation of the Lord when the Red Sea was fixing to part in them going across all right the word salvation then meaning deliverance all right so you'll find salvation in the Old Testament deliverance all right now so you use it to that as I said then you use the blood of bulls and goats for the atonement but the deliverance was there all right then we will miss progress throughout the Old Testament coming up to the point of bringing it to our day in our time okay now what did we cover then there this past Wednesday what is salvation based upon now remember whatever it's based upon dire it'll be based upon that here now get what I'm saying now so don't run it off when we get to the point just remember in the Old Testament it was based upon the blood but it was an animal blood but it was still the blood and it was still alive you know went out all right then you come to the New Testament of Jesus Christ so just stay with me now back in the Old Testament part two to help and find an understanding better Branham on the message God keeps his word he said salvation is based upon the teaching of the Bible all right salvation is based upon the teaching or whatever the Bible says is what your salvation is based upon alright so now we know for sure he's in that salvation is based upon the Word of God all right now we went through that to showing you that even though it was not the written letter it was still dire as the Word of God and it came down to form what we have as to be called the led the word all right now so it's based upon the Word of God now remember it's based upon the Word of God listen you know to get an understanding to me I when I think about the Bible the thing about the Word of God I think of the basis that it's based upon what God says right now so then all the way through the Old Testament you'll find him speaking to mankind right bringing forth his understanding to mankind to bring us to deliver us but we know that the Old Testament said we know that that one sin entered the picture then we sent spent so long you know bringing this the emphasis down that once sin entered the picture that it didn't matter after Adam and Eve all mankind didn't matter if it was able able remember son this past Wednesday a boy was just as perverted as okay oh no April was from Adam he came through the same wound and that's where the pollution was at all right that was what was messed up but it was what first through the wound of his mind then through the physical all right so then there was nothing born after you know look at the sin in the garden that could be worth anything he all would be born in sin shapen in iniquity and spouse from another's wound and going forth alive all right then it wouldn't be something that we could be like the people of the message want to say I come with eternal life well then all right now I'm as honest as can be if you're gonna come with eternal life let's stow the Bible away because what good is what good is the Bible I thought the Bible was what told us how we've lost I thought the law when we'll see how it comes into gets involved in the salvation that we'll see in the law that it was a record keeper or a maker known the law was - were it would make us known that we're sinners all right so then you might watch though the whole Bible away if you say you come with eternal life go what do you need Jesus Christ oh brother Branham said I did let her kill it but the spirit the revealed word gives life we went to those things covered them when everyone said if you have eternal life if you have eternal life the eternal life always was eternal not you right so then we've got the point settle to what we're talking about and we're trying to find deliverance but we're going to find out the biggest point of deliverance is delivering us from the carnality of the mind because that was what he said in the garden I mean - to them that was I'll put enmity the carnal mind enmity because that's where Satan went straight to Eve and polluted that mind with everything since then it's polluted that's why when Jesus Christ came it wasn't necessary that he is a human being step into you as a human begin to try to give you eternal life you understand what I'm saying now it wasn't for him physically step into you physically Ronit you start in the New Testament the same way as a Salvation at Ulta it starts in the mind because that was where the pollution started right so now that's what we're dealing with I'm dealing with mines because I'm looking at him huh and knowing that you and what Satan does that's why we use that scripture so much that Paul said he was afraid that he that Satan through his subtilty would do the same thing too and he was talking to Christians to their mind that was done to Eve's mine all right now so salvation is based upon the Word of God now don't worry about it we'll get to it in a second because the Word of God declares remember when's the Word of God is what declared the blood to be the atonement so come on now just stay with me and listen all right now so then it's based upon what God has already said remember we read that from the Prophet that salvation is based upon the past because it's already said it's already done he declared before the world that he saved us before the world all the thing all right was declared back there to come down to where we're at now all right now we went through the point of talking about the blood that God then showed what his point was because when mankind fail he made the first atonement remember that Wednesday he was the one that killed the animals I gave you the quote from the Prophet all right were God killed the animals and took the skins and put them on Adam and Eve as the atonement so it was a blood atonement all right but the word had already spoken me right remember that the word had spoken out put enmity between thy seed and the seed of the woman he had already spoken and said what would take place all right that it would be a blood atonement because he sacrificed himself the blood of the animals and that's what's so hard I hope it I hope it don't own you a little bit after months and months of trying to show and talk about the the point of how real God is I hope that continues on into your thoughts and not this sentence our thinking now how did God kill them I thought God was a spirit kill an animal even God would be that horrible that he would kill the animals that's exactly what the Bible says the Bible says there in Genesis 3:21 that God made coats well I just don't believe God is that real well that's good you think you're more real in here that's what gets me people who say well I just don't believe God is that he's not that tangible he would take something tangible to kill an animal I thought your prophet said he's not a myth I thought he said he was a person I thought he said he was a being but see we we want to put it things because that's Satan's still talking now are you following me that is Satan still talking to your mind just as he did to Eve in the garden time to get you to reason out things instead of accepting what God says and seeing that God himself applied the blood because that was the only thing that could take place that would speak then of Christ's coming I'll put enmity between thy seed and the one and the seed of the woman one would all have a seed Jesus Christ is the seed of the woman so it spoke right to our Genesis right as quick as a fall King and brother Branham said actually I can give you the quote where he said they were actually on the way out of the garden Lettie skins flopping with blood running all over them and said then God said but I'll put enmity between thy seed Nativa the one see he specifies worthy put his telling them what it was the atonement which would be you know - Jesus Christ alright you follow me see then it would be by applying the blood and we see God himself laid out right around says the welcome mat you remember that one the way the way to have fellowship God laid out the welcome mat back to Adam and Eve by the killing of the animals there was a welcome that they made you're told that he said decade how fellowship again that's what your prophet says through the blood of Jesus Christ that God Himself taking that blood I remember what I guess it was rabbi Richmond I can't remember but it made it it it really dawned on me in thinking about it because he said don't think about Oh in the Old Testament all those animals being offered as something that's horrible said think of love and that really don't know me to think they went out an animal was dire that was love you know well that's not love to cut some throat kicking it is when you know what's taking place right now but it's true believing what God says salvations based upon what God says all right it's based upon the blood so now it'll always be based upon what he says right he'll always be based upon the blood it was changed from the blood of an animal to the blood of a human but it still be based upon blood Kody's always that's why brother brother said it about Abel he said Abel knew that he was born in his mother's blood from his father's blood right blood atonement okay now time to get down to the point then when continuing to message the brother Brian said on the message surge we would see Jesus who gave you that Windus T then the salvation is not based upon what someone else says salvation is not based upon what somebody else says alright now so we've we've been through the message we know we don't have to spend lengthy quotations on the doing that for you to say what somebody else says it's good but there's no salvation in it you don't save you to say what somebody else says we'll get to it in Romans minute when you speak from your heart it don't save you now listen it don't save you because your mother said it don't save you cause your daddy said it don't say because the Prophet said it don't say you say because God said it oh you've got a little stronger definitely you kind of you went a man in any way amen you you can look slower on the life - there all right do you understand what I'm talking about if you're saying what somebody else says they said well we're only way we could say is what's on this hey man come on but if it's not something personal to you in the Bible the only people have ever amounted to anything was the people that believed God was speaking to them there wasn't that's never been based on God speaking to somebody else to come and tell you that's fine that's alright but it's not a revelation until it's revealed to you there's no salvation then in quoting somebody else remember what we was giving during the message surge we would see Jesus he said it's not based upon what someone else says it's based upon what you think of him and how he's speaking to you now based upon somebody else it's based upon what you think he's saying to you they will see then what had happened with abraham abraham believed God was speaking to him and when he believed God was speaking to him God reckoned it to Abraham that's faith so it's not based now upon what somebody else says I don't care who says it do you understand you go a little bit too far brother then when you say not based on what God says well if you're that's mentally incapable of spiritual revelation then you're in bad shape anyway if you don't understand somebody has always got to say something to you that's fine but it's got to be revealed what Sayyad that's what I'm talking about a revelation faith a revelation something that God is speaking to you I come out and I said brother Kali the Lord told me to tell you that's fine that can help him or whatever it is but that won't save it see that's why everybody wants it that way there was three or three or four of us seeking God at the same time when we came into the message and this one brother prayed for all of us one nodded he he said I believe every one of y'all got the Holy Ghost well you know I know two brothers that base their salvation upon the fact of that brother saying it when I'm kind of like the little little boy that says you know after they asked all of them done anything he said he ain't done nothing for me yeah I'm serious he could tell me all day long I say that's fine but until God told me I save it had nothing to do with it other than the lips of somebody else saying it and I would not take that and the true they took it or not he renounce okay all right you understand what I'm saying it's not based on what somebody upset us but it's based upon what God says to you now that doesn't matter whether it's Old Testament or New Testament abraham believed that God was speaking to him and when he believed it he accepted it as that and God counted it to Abraham for righteousness right or you followed me see we're making a basis for salvation now all the Old Testament is a basis for the New Testament salvation so I would listen and you hear me keep emphasizing throughout the time that okay that's what this was that's what this is they said based on the Word of God still based on the Word of God it was based on the blood it's still based on the blood his base don't believe in God was speaking to you it's still based don't believe in God is speaking to you yeah but you just you just shouldn't make it his arrogantly statements as you do okay at least you know I'm not trying to pull them over on you so you know where I stand what would you say right what would you say see we know blood was the way to fellowship but how do we know that was because God is the one that first done it are you following me now whatever he had done I like to the waist I don't remember her brother branham said it or not but I like if somebody made a good point were you know it says in the New Testament there about repent everyone and be baptized his name of Jesus Christ and said if Peter just said repent every one of you stand on your head said that would have been God's Word because God was putting it into the hands of Peter to say it right now so I believe God spoke to you and I by way of a prophet messenger to bring us the message but if it's not revealed you're still just as dead letter as can be you can read the Bible we read the Bible we studied the Bible but until it was revealed it's not the Word of God it's letters on a page and something you can burn up what is the church built a poem mom let's build on the revelation of Jesus Christ if the Old Testament is not correct in the way it was bro then there would be no New Testament are you are you following me so then we have to depend totally upon the fact of what the Old Testament says so when the Old Testament said that God made coats of skin Genesis 3:21 then it's God doing it remember the point of Jonah salvation is of the Lord it's not what you and I do remember we read that we're brother Branham gave it where he said salvation is not based upon praying when we read a whole length it's not based upon an experience not based upon them things it's not based upon sensation design but yet you're not going to be born again without a sensation and the experience of believing right all right but it's basing the salvation the deliverance not upon something you do but it's basing upon what you believe he's already done you come up say I want to be saved and I'd say well God done it for the foundation of the world yeah but I won't be saved well God done it for the foundation world what I want you to do is believe you down it and put it upon the basis of what God says now listen put it upon what God says to you personally to you not upon what he says to somebody else come on I thought that we believed in the prophets message and I thought the way we believed it was that he said one day like this and he said now I could tell you maybe what about that but he said now that wouldn't be what the Lord said and he said I wouldn't do that for nothing right is that what he said he said I'd never do he said because you'd get to where you depend on something that I say it Gloriana be greatly depend upon what God says in his word it's great to depend upon what the Prophet brought into it it's great to believe what God uses people to speak to us that's wonderful but the point of it is there's no salvation unless it becomes a personal a personal experience and see then the new birth will never be contrary to that see like I said I hope to god that this will tie back with the previous messages and if you'll get away from the basis that God is not real he's just a spirit he's just a spirit just an anointing just a spirit we believe that that's the Word of God but we believe God is real and God being real then what's the problem today now think about it they're gonna write our point it's based upon the word it's based upon the blood okay it's based upon your personally believing that God spoke to you all right now what's this go ahead with number one brothers we'll start with their quotation and look what the Bible says we're doing a great faith chapter save reading we come down see the song huh my faith Enoch was translated then he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him where before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God now what does pleased God mean you remember well he was just such a great good guy is that all you can think that if it was necessary as we read to start with in Romans that Abraham to believe God before God would impute a reckoner count to Abraham the righteousness by faith would it not be the same thing about Enoch and we've been through it that's the same point you just keep reading where we gave you in Romans how that it's not reckoned unto works we know better so in the Old Testament see your mind is connected to thinking about works because you try to get the blow you try to get something better to do something to do this that cause remember we'll get down to it the law was God in the letter form huh but remember the law was never been added the law was added according to the scripture because of transgression and the transgression is people not believing what the Word of God says to keep it straight and they transgress now the law was a schoolmaster which is no salvation in the law and he said they made the biggest mistake they ever made by choosing law and we'll get to these times see they chose law thinking it was grace boom there's a message called offer grace listening to the Prophet so then remember whatever please God with Abraham is he's talking about pleasing God with C we want to talk about it oh he was just such a good guy well that's good that's fine I'm sure he was but he's still not based on the good guy now come on church we're no Testament I hope you stay with me in your mind it's not even in the Old Testament of being good makes you a Christian it might put you to a by pie situation or something for you to do what the law says and everything but remember all the Old Testament pointed to Jesus Christ you got to come to Christ to have a perfection from sin of the Old Testament it was just covered right come on before he is translation he had this testimony that he pleased God now watch without faith now where's your works at where's your doing we're just something you can do where do something you could make yourself better and God would honor it but without faith it is impossible to please him then watch it for he that cometh to God watch them must believe that he is is not Pais you know is his present tense he's right you're not you don't believe what he was doing with his present and watch now he that cometh to God must believe that he is whatever he was he still is come on and that he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek him now he that cometh to God must believe that he is do you know what that puts you all believe in the word believe in the blood leaving in personal experience with God not even talking about them Old Testament people have a personal sphere what do you think they're believing was we can go down to a lot of it in by the house and in condemning all of this I want because of his faith so it wasn't based upon how good Abraham was or how good a nut was or how good nor was or any of these it's based upon what God said now maybe we're going over to Paul and quote and get into Romans or not who's gonna condemn Abraham when God said it all right who's gonna say Abraham was guilty this doubt of the other some guys tried it with with Noah I mean I know what job guys tried with job to condemn him and he said listen I've done what God say there's a record down with a high priest that I offered my offerings so why are you guys sitting here condemning me of being a sinner when I'd done exactly and see that the point you that Joe would be getting to him say have you ever done wrong what was her name the guys you remember and don't get the last one because that Elihu Elihu tops Christ so leave him kind of out of that until you can understand the other guys that were talking to Joe we couldn't joke look at them and say do you do anything wrong well yes Joe by did well what you do you know what did you do take care I made the sacrifice joke said well why you condemning me because you got a record I made my sacrifice you understand but they didn't want to believe they still thought he was a secret center my God why would God be putting these things upon you if you hadn't done something secretly your secret sinner job he said I'm just telling you what I've done and I'm telling you what God says and so now we're right back where we started it's based upon what God says to you salvation is based upon what God says to you instead of what God says about you through somebody else okay now listen so then if you're gonna come to God go into what we just read Hebrews if you're gonna come to God you've got to do what for he that cometh to God must believe that God is and then he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek him to anything and whatsoever is based upon your salvation the Old Testament was based upon believing that God spoke to you he's not a hard thing just believe God neck alone you see what is the problem don't remember what the property he said he said I believe maybe that would be you know I could tell you about that but said what if it was not right he said then the next time you come and ask me you're serious right no matter what you can be well blessed and have a lot of them are knowing things and all kind of things and just remember one thing it was never the anointing in the Old Testament it was the offering of the sacrifice so now we're we're gonna put it in the New Testament right now you follow me salvation whatever it's based upon back tyre is still based upon the same thing now and it's the believing that God has spoke to you and told you what to do and you've done it right come on let's go to the next one let's jump to the New Testament pick up the scripture go to number 2 Romans he's describing the righteousness of the law as a man which dudes those things you little bomb in sight but the righteousness of faith speaketh on this wise say not in thine heart who shall ascend into heaven that is to bring Christ down from above don't don't try to figure out how to get him down to where yeah or get him up to where yeah just say what he says believe it okay or who she'll descend into the deep that is to bring up Christ again from the dead but what saith it the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth in that heart that is the Word of Faith which we preach no how are you gonna get faith how are you gonna get anything no look that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus that's where everybody puts I've confessed I've done this I've confessed but that ain't no hole what God's saying and she'll believe in thine heart that God has raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation and then what's your old testament salvation i believing in your heart that god has spoken to you and confessing it with your mouth and don't make no difference what anybody else says about it right it don't make no difference what anybody else says if you believe in what God says to you but now remember we make sure we get everything straight with the line okay God's not gonna speak something to you contrary to the word he's not gonna tell you it's all right to drink and saying the law that's wrong to drink now he's not gonna do it right he will speak according to the law and keep it lined up with that now why because it's faith are believing now I'm trying to make it as simple as the thought could be made that salvation is based upon whether or not number one you can believe that God is you know he's real you got to believe that first and then believe that he's speaking to you not to somebody else it's so close to I remember when a prophet would come out and say thus saith the Lord you realize what they're saying and they just say if Jonah that ain't just the end job that's just say if the Lord through them thus saith the Lord means the Lord speaking through you all right that's why it won't save you there's somebody else saying something probably you know wouldn't you like to hear a voice from heaven say that you're saved when you love to believe that all is gone and your life is pure and settled in Christ true that would be wonderful wouldn't it but what if the voice continues and says now going live like the devil cuz everything's alright now there's something wrong with something talking to you is that a simple of salvation we can get it simply believe it Cain believed that he had to make an atonement but why didn't he go with the blood when surely his mom and dad explained to him about the blood in the beginning and what happened there's no record at Adam and Eve offered sacrifices but I like to say it this way there's no record they didn't okay in other words we got it 50/50 right then won't do nobody no good we worried about where Adam and Eve offer a sacrifice we know God made one for him but you know he didn't make one for at for Cain and Abel oh now you had some a little different time now that let's go all the way back to where we're still in the message right that God didn't curse Adam and God didn't curse Eve cuz how could he curse him if they had eternal life okay the Cain and Abel come forth without eternal life so God made the atonement for Adam and Eve did you get it why because in Adam and Eve was eternal life the Cain and Abel had to make her a home but they still they knew to make it and why would Cain and not knowing all he knew about surely by the end of what took place why would he not offer blood because he was still trying to work his way to heaven that won't work but Abel knew it was blood come on folks get the story listen to what I'm talking about you know Cain and Abel had asked their momma and daddy and their mom and daddy surely through life somewhere had explained the situation to the garden well I don't know where they don't know we just don't know and forget it I'm just trying to make a point the point is one time they had a long time to know about an offering and when they made an offering how come can come out of it with fruits they won't glory but Abel he coming up seeing it with the blood amen you don't think Cain knew it was blood you think Cain did Eve explain the Cain maybe it was thick leaves cuz that first thing she done and Adam with her if they did explain it was big leaves then you can see the cat that Abel got a revelation straight from God that's the point of what I'm trying to make the point I'm trying to make is one time do you believe that God has spoken to you do you believe he's spoken to you in your salvation hurry depending upon what somebody else said come on then what are we getting what was salvation to them the fact that they believed God brother that's just that's too simple too simple we've got a house something give us ooh is that what they said over in the mount Sonny I come on Reggie Bible they said Moses you go up and whatever he tells you we all do see that ways way brother random knew that they were the ones asking for it we think God's full intentions was to give it to him mm-hmm they asked for it and got it that's where I killed him what about it do you believe that God has personally spoken to you in your heart now remember my point a moment ago he can't speak to you anything contrary to the word and it be God right he can't tell you it's all right to do something when he's already said in the word don't do it right because that's putting it on something else you're taking what Satan is coming through your mind then into your being all right so then what is salvation of the okhta deliverance for whatever they had need of what it was for the time we're in Israel out of Egypt where it was the children out of the fiery furnace whether it was you know whatever it was it's deliverance all right and that spoke of the salvation of mankind so that was natural things but mankind he's wanting a savior so God told him go offer the lamb right who offer the lamb as I said be real careful how you handle a lot of things because remember the way Balaam got ahold of God with how by making the seven Rams just like Elijah and them did so remember we're coming back to one time it's based on faith in God it's based on whether you can believe God or not yeah but I think there's just a little bit of works in that now where'd you get that if you couldn't get it from the Bible and you didn't get it from the Prophet so you got it from the devil I don't like that brother deal cuz you don't leave me anything you don't leave me any hopes my hopes has always been build on it I didn't do this and I didn't do that then we'll get to it'll get a more into the law and talk about it I see Church the only way you can be saved is what Old Testament New Testament which where it is now the only way you can be saved as what by revelation from God Abell it was revealed unto him right Moses it was revealed unto him code he met the burning bush he knew a lot about him didn't he his mama taught him a lot about God and his ways and you remember the story the Prophet would give you that Moses you know because of all of that he knew about God he could say he had a personal experience but when he come to the burning bush he found out his experience wasn't good enough his experience was the fact of believing the God came on the scene to him and and he could believe how about it is your revelation based upon salvation I mean salvation upon a revelation because the Prophet says you can only be this is Patmos vision you can only be known by revelation and you can only be saved by revelation did you have a knowledge of it intellectually but you can't be saved until it's revealed to you no man can call Jesus the Christ only by the Holy Ghost that's what the Bible says no man can say Jesus is Christ until he has received the Holy Ghost now you remember brother Brown said you stop a drunk going down the highway and said he can say Jesus is the Christ business is not words you don't get nothing out of the whole message you get one time of what I'm trying to bring it's just not acts of the fact of me you know people trying to believe this without or the other it's when God began to speak to my end they believed he was speaking to them that's my whole point if you don't believe God is speaking to you well the one good is it and if you back down wouldn't you believe that God is speaking to you and when he spoke to them back there he wasn't telling him a book of rules to keep come on he was telling them to go back to your totalement go off for the lam if you want salvation so it's not recorded as to point a lot of times that the people making atonement right I mean you you read a whole chapter and you don't see a thing about them making offerings or anything but then when you see a situation come up that they really needed deliverance or whatever for that point you can see that situation existing you see them making an atonement hurry right you remember when Moses told Aaron go along the people get that sense forgets that Cole's right off the altar go among the people says pre adventure you make an atonement but see it was based upon what they believe now that's the whole point I can read all of this about revelation he must be revealed to you personally that salvation that God revealed himself to you personally abraham believed God and it was counted a reckoning to him Moses believed God now you know but it's not listed that God spoke to everybody like them so we got to make it more a little more simple we've got to get it to the basis that we find out maybe that all right they seen it work for Moses and they they believe God was speaking to them and they'd go make an atonement I've always believed it I believe this in a Baptist Church I can remember sitting reading the Word of God and thinking about those Old Testament Saints as they offered the sacrifices you know and that's all God you mean everybody they walked up and laid down a lamb no sincerity they just flop it down and they walked back forgiven mrs. Lord I don't see that because you said you didn't look at man like that you looked at it honest in a sincere heart you said she has even fed up with their offerings and sacrifices and they become a speak in your nostrils so everybody come to everybody that went up lay the land that wasn't forgiven oh they might have had the record swept away you know remember cuz they kept a record of what you done and then they cleaned the records they might have got all the things done but that didn't put it between you and God what is a true believer what is a true believer scripturally speaking no matter where you're at what is it a true believer it's a person that can believe that God is and that he will keep his word today as much as he ever kept it if he just believed you she didn't alive leaving is based upon you and I and especially it was back dark they thought about girl life live save them but it wasn't that it was the atonement that was being made pushing that to Calvary pushing it pushing it pushing and knowing that Jesus Christ would come to make the salvation complete so then it wasn't any new birth and the Old Testament there wasn't a giving of eternal life in the Old Testament but it was pushing it forward to Christ making an atonement a covering or deliverance that's why I'm using that word it was the salvation what was salvation in the Old Testament believing God had spoken to you and you offered a blood atonement because of what I'm saying to you and you accepting that as the fact that God had personally spoken to you a lot of the contacts that are made in the Old Testament was made in the basis of not nice to say salvation it was a saying of a deliverance for some reason Moses with the burning bush to tell him about the point of of delivering the children of Israel but don't you think he sit back I turn on the backside of that desert and he sat down there and he thought mama spent all of her life I know you you watch the ten commandments they don't come out the way the Bible declares okay one time brother Brennan will talk about 17 years old 16 years old the time he talking about it when his mom was need his difference justice dollars but she told him said you're not the son of Pharaoh you're a Jew he looked at that and he thought I'm gonna deliver so I said you you look the 10 commandments and I enjoy that's a good movie but these radish groups are the ones I've ever seen but it still kind of missed that line there because it waited to leave was about 45 years old or some worries over doing and doing all he do and then all at once you'll find out he's a Jew and he gets into trouble well that's not exactly the way brought around him described it so we take what he said so he knew all of his life why do you think he trained remember he could teach the Egyptians he trained he was getting ready to be a deliverer cuz he believed that's what he's father remember what the Prophet said all that mama told him was not enough cuz that was somebody else that was good he knew use a deliverer he believed he was a deliverer but he when he wound up with a stinking dead Egyptian he got scared and run but when he met God at the burning bush he had something personal he wasn't afraid afraid row he wasn't afraid of none of those times he just said okay what's her name Zipporah they said get two young uns ready and let's go where we're going we're going to eat you what we're gonna do in Egypt we're going on takeover oh heck over are you gonna go up to Pharaoh and declare that if you know the old daddy now nan said Oh daddy was already gone the wonder what his name was that you know they really love Moses he's already gone he said we're going down there to take over we're gonna have a salvation that God said was going to take place and God has come to us and you know what I'm talking about they preached that Sunday after Sunday after Sunday right cowboy sir ever what you want to call him when they had services they preached a coming deliverer we're going to be delivered and Moses sit and listen and he says mama is that what you're talking about you've born for that son with that wouldn't enough but when he got something personal into burning bush he was never afraid of the Egyptians no more I think about that I remember in the Baptist Church I used to read really I think about those sign I was thinking you know I mean you go off you turn and go front right what's wrong you go for until Toronto I'm gonna take over and he tweets sitting there's a couple of guys come get you and you've gone you know us our highs we don't care ain't none of our business but just think of Moses walking up to the Pharaoh of Egypt I mean all there to do get rid of him evidently he must have remembered Moses and evidently he must have remembered I know the story - cause Moses talked about it when we're little always playing he thought he was a deliverer and said I've got to leave that oh boy alone because he's gonna cause an insurrection now you tell me think something sensible like that happened he's gonna cause an insurrection among these people so I'd better be careful with this old boy come on you're talking to the fire road they said come a million and they kill him the Moses never had no fear I'll surely turn racing Lord now what I do now they're not doing it they're not obeying you but what I do now he said okay you do this he go do that and he said Lord now what I do sure come on he was a human but he still didn't run well cuz he had something personal come on is this it he had something personal he had an experience of salvation now listen do you think maybe this could be a point that Moses was thinking when our Lord you delivered me and I believe you can deliver the him and if I if I am the guy I'm sure he doubted he wondered if I'm the guy to deliver then Lord it's left up to you I'm gonna just walk out there you remember they told that to brother Branham in the beginning don't leave don't do this don't do that he said but God called me I've got to go see when the deliverer speaks to you you have no fear like I've always said you think about it God went down and anointed David through the Prophet learnt he anointed him to be king you think David was afraid of ten glass or any kind of glass now he knew one thing for certain he wasn't gonna die until he sat on the throne because the Prophet didn't say how long we gonna live after you get there just told him said you're the man David and you're going to sit on the throne he had no worries once he got on the throne he's probably started wondering what's gonna take place now but until then there's a whole settled because God said it what salvation based on old our new God said it again we believe and we believe it's for us remember that was one of the conditions I read it to you was to believe that God was speaking to you hell no doubt less than what we got salvation is on the Lord [Music] it's later than you see anybody have an ad altered hoping the bride is prepare for me [Music] and no days already the crime behind [Music] - here - we've got some prayer cloths cut up and we got some more here and all but we do roam about we just want to pray over the ease and then we'll put them out we'd leave it right because we believe the words are gone father we lay our hands upon these prayer clothes believe in you that whatever the need that would take place and the person receiving these that they'd receive it from you lord they'd believe it and deliverance would be their salvation for whatever healing of the body or salvation for soul whatever it be it would be there we thank you and we committed to you Lord and believe in you in Jesus name this is the evening time explain a new thing [Music] the bride forty to me and all things are ready [Applause] combined I for he that has an ear to hear the evening time father we thank you for today and we just pray that you would Lord speak to each one of our hearts and tell us about your salvation because it truly is deliverance whatever we have need of it delivered the people back down that delivers now so we pray that you would just God and bless each one but maybe we will remember that the salvation is solely based upon you speaking to us not something we could do or any thoughts would be based on you speaking to us and us believing it and we thank you in Jesus you're dismissed [Music] and this is the evening time it's later than you think the bride is preparing now for her Lord to me you
