[21:31] I want you to know that we appreciate
[21:34] all of you and that we will be not there
[21:38] will be no
[21:39] changes as far as anything immediate
[21:42] until July except now brother Bob is
[21:47] accepted the role of assistant pastor of
[21:49] the church so he will be the assistant
[21:51] pastor today starting forward all right
[21:59] I believe you guys are comfortable with
[22:01] him and I'm comfortable with him and I'm
[22:03] comfortable when I'm not here I need to
[22:05] feel some kind of comfort so I and not
[22:07] that the other ones are not well I
[22:08] already talked about all this but um but
[22:11] brother Bob's done a a wonderful job and
[22:13] and um absolutely has grown a lot in the
[22:16] Lord I remember the first time when U I
[22:20] approached him he was teaching Sunday
[22:21] school class and I approached him I said
[22:24] you know you might want to try to put
[22:25] something
[22:26] together you know and and um and this
[22:29] was when Dad was still pastoring the
[22:31] church and I said uh cuz that big man up
[22:35] there may ask you one day if you'd like
[22:37] to say something I said you better be
[22:38] ready and he was like oh he his palms
[22:41] sweat y'all y'all shook hands with him
[22:44] Lord I thought we was going to have a
[22:45] baptismal service right there just off
[22:47] of his hands but he was so nervous but
[22:50] you see he's grown and that's been you
[22:51] know 10 or so more years ago that
[22:53] brother Bob's been preaching the gospel
[22:56] we sure appreciate brother Aaron and
[22:57] brother lis also they're just they're
[23:00] they're good
[23:03] soldiers and I'm looking for another one
[23:06] I need somebody else to step up and
[23:08] we'll have a few more we send you out
[23:10] somewhere
[23:11] else but uh uh we we know for sure that
[23:15] um brother Terence and brother Ryan are
[23:17] are deacons brother Bob wants to step
[23:19] away you
[23:20] cannot um give up your post you can just
[23:23] be inactive so brother Bob uh since he's
[23:27] now going to be the assistant p p and
[23:29] then since he will still be doing Sunday
[23:31] school here he's asked to step away so
[23:34] I'll be looking for a couple of deacons
[23:37] and um Mom and I were talking the other
[23:39] day we talking about deacons brother
[23:40] Brown said deacons have a more stringent
[23:43] qualification than a a preacher a pastor
[23:47] because they supposed to be married and
[23:49] supposed to have children a pastor
[23:51] doesn't have to be but a deacon needs to
[23:54] be married with Children to qualify for
[23:58] being a deacon and apt to teach and take
[24:01] care of widows and orphans that's what
[24:03] the Bible says so um I'm going be
[24:05] looking for a couple of deacons there
[24:07] also Brother Gary and brother Dar our
[24:09] trustees I'm going to be looking for one
[24:11] more there just to take some of the load
[24:13] off of some of them and we know that
[24:15] brother Donnie brother collie's board of
[24:16] directors and Terrence is the president
[24:20] we've set up as a corporation years and
[24:21] years ago so um but just wanted to make
[24:24] sure you understand this and also for
[24:26] your Sunday school teachers
[24:28] brother Bob will not be the
[24:30] superintendent anymore brother Ryan will
[24:32] be the one so if you have to be out you
[24:35] need to see brother Ryan when if you're
[24:37] out now brother Bob will
[24:39] be doing Sunday school here and he will
[24:42] be responsible for getting his own
[24:44] replacement all right but brother Ryan
[24:47] from from brother Michael all the way
[24:49] downstairs you'll need to see brother
[24:51] Ryan about getting you a replacement if
[24:53] you need to be out all right is
[24:55] everybody with me on that all right I'm
[24:57] just kind of trying to go over just a
[24:58] few things just to make sure that that
[25:00] some of you sisters understand that U
[25:03] what kind of went on a little bit and um
[25:07] also we want to make sure that you know
[25:09] that brother Dale's going to be taken
[25:11] care of he's not going to be put out to
[25:13] dry he's going to be taken care of he's
[25:16] took care of this church we're going to
[25:18] take care of him and that's including my
[25:20] mother too okay so we're going to make
[25:22] those decisions though later on in July
[25:24] we're going to wait till July to see um
[25:27] if I run anybody body off or if uh you
[25:30] continue to stay here but I'm going to
[25:33] continue to work I'm not going to quit
[25:34] so I'm going to continue to work and
[25:36] because I have good insurance at the
[25:37] post office and I can get off when I
[25:40] need to and um that will take a burden
[25:42] away from the church because uh at my
[25:44] age my u u insurance would be $1,000 a
[25:48] month and I pay 240 a month at at the
[25:52] post office and it's really good
[25:54] insurance and remember Sister Jun May
[25:55] the 21st she's going to have her hip
[25:57] replaced so remember her for that
[26:01] um and also we've set in place some
[26:04] things that in case I become
[26:05] incapacitated that we know what to do
[26:09] right and um if you need to ask that you
[26:11] can ask the deacons or or the people
[26:14] that were here uh also
[26:18] um let's see we're going to have um
[26:21] addition of
[26:22] leaders and which will be Deacon and um
[26:25] and
[26:26] trustees uh we're going to start having
[26:28] quarterly meetings but we'll talk about
[26:30] all that in July we'll be meeting with
[26:32] the heads if you have any questions any
[26:34] your sisters have questions about
[26:36] anything see one of the deacons or
[26:37] myself or one of the ministers we were
[26:39] all here but we sure appreciate all of
[26:42] you we appreciate your
[26:44] support we absolutely appreciate your
[26:46] support we're going to continue Mission
[26:48] work just that is what I mean just we're
[26:50] we're pretty much staying status quo
[26:52] until July and see what's going on see
[26:54] how we're doing I don't want to U um I
[26:58] alarm anyone but but but seasons
[27:01] change um things
[27:03] change uh so we want to be ready for
[27:07] that to meet the challenge not let the
[27:09] challenge come and we not be ready for
[27:11] it all right and then we also talked
[27:13] about um over all the
[27:16] years brother Dale of course he never
[27:19] took all the tithes so he put money back
[27:21] into church all right and we would build
[27:23] off of it and we would do things with it
[27:26] well we may have to come to the season
[27:27] now to where
[27:28] uh I'd like to have a bathroom in that
[27:30] study cuz that's when you see me go out

[27:39] we'd like to do a little expanding but
[27:42] we may start a building fund we may
[27:43] start U asking you if you want to put
[27:45] the money in um like I said seasons
[27:49] change with Everything's changed the uh
[27:51] you always well as I do the Heyday of of
[27:54] of of having plenty is about over
[27:58] we could lose our jobs we could be
[28:01] persecuted there's a lot of things could
[28:03] happen that had not happened 20 years
[28:06] ago when we could do things now it is
[28:09] and I want to be very cautious I'm
[28:12] optimistic but I'm a
[28:14] realist okay I understand that that we
[28:17] can't do all the things you know we
[28:18] can't build a I wish we could build a
[28:20] $300,000 uh you know totally renovate
[28:23] the building and have plenty of room and
[28:24] plenty of downstairs and plenty of where
[28:26] you don't have to do that you know
[28:28] up there and the and the The Voice goes
[28:30] out and it hits that thing comes back
[28:32] but we're doing the best we can what we
[28:33] got as long as you pull on the word of
[28:36] God and I preach the word of God and
[28:38] these brothers preach the word of God
[28:40] that's the main goal all right it's the
[28:42] word of God is the main goal all right
[28:46] and as I told them before I have
[28:48] counseled with many pastors about
[28:50] different situations and I um I don't I
[28:54] don't talk to everybody but I do talk to
[28:56] pastors cuz I'm sorry I can't talk to my
[28:59] dad so I brother I pull off of brother
[29:02] Mike IG brother Chris long and brother
[29:05] Claude different ones Brother Scott
[29:07] they've been pastors for 30 years or
[29:09] longer so um I'll make mistakes and I
[29:13] apologize
[29:14] already because I'm human but I'm going
[29:17] to try to minimize them as we keep going
[29:19] on as church and uh as I said before if
[29:24] you didn't vote for me hang on give me a
[29:27] little time and let's see if you you
[29:29] like the word this the word
[29:32] first all right if I keep preaching the
[29:35] word of God then if I if I don't look
[29:38] good I'm sorry okay if I don't preach
[29:41] the way you want me to but it's what
[29:42] it's the content of what you say is is
[29:45] um is important it's the word of God
[29:48] it's and like I said before it I
[29:49] admonished all the people with with a
[29:52] job in this church be here be on time

[31:41] prayer let's bow our heads do heavenly
[31:44] father thank you Lord one more time
[31:46] we're able to stand before the greatest
[31:49] people that ever walked on the face of
[31:50] the Earth and father you told us that if
[31:53] we would we would listen if we would
[31:55] open our ears open the eyes of our heart
[31:59] as the song says that Lord to hear from
[32:01] you take take all the emotion and all
[32:04] the I don't like this and I don't like
[32:06] that but Lord you give us a word you
[32:08] give us a Bible you gave us the word of
[32:11] God it has never been changed it's plain
[32:15] and simple and father I pray that that
[32:16] plain Simplicity will be here today that
[32:19] you'll anoint us to do the things that
[32:21] we're supposed to do anointed this
[32:23] church Lord to hear from you father the
[32:25] great Shepherd as we're going to see in
[32:26] a minute the Chief Shepherd that's who
[32:29] we're looking for Lord I pray that you'd
[32:31] bless the ones that are not here all the
[32:32] ministers that are out in different
[32:34] places ministering ones that are not
[32:35] here that are sick different ones Lord
[32:38] doing different things father I pray
[32:39] that you'd bless them and bring them
[32:40] back together Lord later on this week
[32:44] father I pray that you be with us in the
[32:45] baptismal service that someone else may
[32:48] may come forward Lord and not just be
[32:50] little sister Iva but maybe there's a
[32:52] there's another one there that's
[32:53] thinking about it father well we pray
[32:55] that you would anoint their hearts Lord
[32:57] to uh to come and be baptized in your
[32:59] precious name the name of the Lord Jesus
[33:02] Christ that's who you are we love you
[33:05] Lord and thank you
[33:09] amen I like these two quotes I
[33:12] understand once again that the greatness
[33:13] of God always reveals itself in the
[33:15] simple things always we're looking for
[33:17] these great big things with fireworks
[33:19] and all that simple life lived is the
[33:23] greatest thing against the devil he
[33:26] hates a life that live for God he hates
[33:30] it and life with God is Not immunity
[33:34] from difficult right I've already said
[33:36] this before it's not an immunity from
[33:38] difficulties but peace in those
[33:40] difficulties we all go through them
[33:42] because we said before we looked at
[33:44] Smyrna and we'll see it in a minute that
[33:46] it means death and that there's just all
[33:47] kind of persecution going on in these
[33:49] different Church ages listen you've
[33:51] never had to fight to get here to a
[33:53] church service through policemen
[33:58] through a mob through a crowd and have
[34:01] to lock the doors to have
[34:03] service not yet these people had to
[34:07] these people in the Dark Ages if they
[34:09] just said we're a Christian they would
[34:11] be put to death amen but now we're able
[34:14] to be safe at the moment and be able to
[34:19] uh to listen to what God says to us but
[34:21] today we're going to kind of review and
[34:23] then go over something I want to talk
[34:25] about is four living creatures all right
[34:29] let's read Revelations 1:10 I was in the
[34:31] spirit on the Lord's Day heard behind me
[34:33] a great voice as of a trumpet saying I
[34:36] am Alpha and Omega the first and the
[34:38] last and what thou seest wrest in the
[34:41] book and send it into the seven churches
[34:43] which are in Asia Ephesus Smyrna
[34:45] pergamus thara Sardis Philadelphia and
[34:48] the age we're living in now leosa and I
[34:51] turned to see that voice that spake with
[34:52] me and being turned I saw seven golden
[34:55] candlesticks and in the midst of the
[34:57] seven candlestick one liken to the son
[34:58] of man clothed with a garment down to
[35:00] the foot and G about the paps with a
[35:02] golden girdle and we know that's bride
[35:04] form all right Revelations 4:6 and you
[35:07] can be seated Before the Throne there
[35:08] was a sea of glass like into Crystal and
[35:11] in the midst of the throne and round
[35:12] about The Throne now this is Revelations
[35:14] 4 this is this is after the Rapture
[35:17] remember we go up in 41 the bride does
[35:20] and this is a scene that John saw there
[35:22] were four beasts full of eyes before and
[35:25] behind and the first Beast was like a
[35:28] lion and the second beast like a calf or
[35:30] an ox and the third Beast had the face
[35:32] of a man and the fourth Beast was like a
[35:35] flying eagle you may be seated in the
[35:37] Lord as his Blessing to the reading of
[35:39] the word now we understand that this is
[35:42] John after the Rapture took
[35:44] place in heaven a scene and he sees
[35:48] these four beasts with Lion they had a
[35:51] head of a lion calf or ox man and an
[35:53] eagle all right but we're going to read
[35:55] in Ezekiel where Ezekiel talks about the
[35:57] wheel and in the middle of the wheel and
[35:58] we'll see where he talks about the same
[36:00] identical thing he sees the same vision
[36:04] but he has a little bit different angle
[36:06] to it and we'll get to that just a
[36:07] little bit cuz I know all of you if
[36:10] you're Bible studiers and you know the
[36:12] the message of the hour those four Beast
[36:14] are the Holy
[36:16] Ghost that's the guards to the temple
[36:19] guards to the altar that Holy Ghost
[36:22] today is what guards you from doing
[36:24] wrong it where's the throne the throne's
[36:27] not out there
[36:28] Thrones in here there's no more wheels
[36:30] in the middle of the wheel wheel with
[36:31] the middle of the wheel was those going
[36:32] through the 40 years in the wilderness
[36:34] with the Ark on the on the cart the
[36:36] ark's not there anymore that ark's
[36:38] inside of you that's right all right is
[36:40] everybody with me so that lion ox man
[36:42] and Eagle those characteristics are in
[36:44] the Holy Ghost that's in you today but
[36:47] each age as brother Brown tells us we'll
[36:50] get to it maybe later on that in every
[36:52] age there was one of these Beast or one
[36:55] of these came to the Forefront I know
[36:57] brother Ryan asked many many years ago
[36:59] and he'll remember because it says there
[37:01] were four beasts full of eyes before and
[37:03] behind now we'll look in in Ezekiel
[37:06] Ezekiel says that they never went
[37:09] backwards right all right okay and if
[37:13] you take a box which is you know lion ox
[37:16] man and Eagle it looks like they're
[37:18] going if if the man was going in this
[37:20] Direction all these other ones would
[37:22] going be going backwards the one behind
[37:24] but you got to remember God is so fast
[37:28] he's Eternal he's an eternal being and
[37:30] this is eternal these are living
[37:33] creatures and every time you need
[37:35] something that head turns will it turn
[37:36] so fast till they're never going
[37:38] backwards never going backwards they're
[37:40] always going forward and we'll read that
[37:42] in the Book of
[37:44] Ezekiel and clear it up maybe if you
[37:46] look and say w I don't know how that
[37:48] happened well if God wrote it in the
[37:49] Bible there's a way for it to happen all
[37:51] right so we have to depend on that but
[37:53] now let's remember that we'll go back to
[37:55] the church ages just for a moment we
[37:57] look at the mind of God today as we were
[38:00] as all of you this week were studying on
[38:02] the word of God I hope somebody did a
[38:04] little study and sometime during this
[38:06] week or thought about God or read a
[38:08] scripture or heard a message or or or
[38:10] read a quote or I'm sure you did from
[38:12] everybody
[38:15] else I ain't going to say
[38:17] Netflix I
[38:19] did but did you think about God if it
[38:22] was God that you were thinking about
[38:24] that was a mind of God coming to
[38:26] you I didn't need to be there the other
[38:29] preachers didn't need to be there you
[38:31] got to get this for
[38:32] yourself remember brother ran said it's
[38:35] not the preacher's fault cuz you don't
[38:36] make a Rapture it's your fault all right
[38:40] so don't blame it on the preacher all
[38:42] right everybody with me don't be calm
[38:46] let's have some excitement today so that
[38:48] message was sealed up though for all
[38:50] those three eternity and all of a sudden
[38:52] some kind of a a way God comes down and
[38:56] he steps forward and we're a able to
[38:57] understand him and it's called the logos
[38:59] or the speech God begins to speak but
[39:02] remember when he if he speaks there's
[39:05] got to be something said I mean there's
[39:07] got when God speaks there's got to be an
[39:09] action me and you we have what Idle
[39:11] Words half the stuff we think about half
[39:14] the stuff we talk about what never comes
[39:17] to pass that's right everybody with me
[39:19] that's right how many times have you
[39:21] formulated a a thought and you're like
[39:24] this is it this is it this is it that
[39:27] ain't it well God don't waste his time
[39:30] once he thinks and says it it's a piece
[39:33] that matches he's got somebody on Earth
[39:35] that's going to hear it but now not just
[39:37] one man though that's right like I said
[39:39] before even Columba when we get to that
[39:41] middle age Columba died before the age
[39:43] even began so somebody had to listen to
[39:46] what he said the message he had and was
[39:49] given from God somebody had to listen to
[39:51] that and it Quicken and carry on all
[39:54] right so we'll see that in the lion Ox
[39:56] of man and the eagle
[39:57] the first three Church ages are the lion
[39:59] are l i o n not lying lion Church age
[40:03] all right there was a lot of lying going
[40:05] on but that was on the other side so the
[40:07] Mysteries unfolded there was there was a
[40:09] mystery that was hid even from
[40:12] Paul come on
[40:15] somebody the hidden Mystery was the
[40:17] seals coming up here in lay out of s
[40:20] Paul didn't have a a revelation of the
[40:22] seals being open he could see things but
[40:24] he looked through the glass doly he he
[40:26] could see things but he couldn't see
[40:28] clearly cuz it wasn't time for him to
[40:30] see clearly now you and I in this age we
[40:32] must See Clearly that's why we must be
[40:35] held to a high standard all the time sir
[40:38] not just part time that's right all
[40:40] right and if we fall B that's
[40:43] Grace and you know who to find it from
[40:47] and where to go and all the steps to get
[40:50] Grace brother rown priest marage and
[40:52] divorce the grace of it for a purpose we
[40:56] needed it
[40:58] amen we needed it that's why he preached
[41:01] it cuz we needed Grace I'm glad it
[41:04] wasn't left up to me and
[41:06] you cuz we wouldn't be preaching Grace
[41:09] we preach
[41:10] condemnation
[41:14] judgment well praise the Lord anyhow
[41:16] thank God for Grace thank God he sent a
[41:18] prophet cuz God knew that we listen if
[41:20] if he sent
[41:22] Paul if he sent Moses let's go well back
[41:25] if he sent Moses to GR a writing of
[41:27] divorcement I'm not going to preach on
[41:28] marriage divorce just sit still but I
[41:31] make a point Moses the people must have
[41:35] needed it or God wouldn't give that
[41:36] Grace to
[41:37] Moses CU remember God don't do something
[41:40] frivolously he doesn't do something
[41:41] without a without a plan and a purpose
[41:43] so then Paul Paul comes and he says look
[41:46] at all these people you know he comes
[41:47] into Corinthians and he sees this this
[41:49] boy living this man living with his uh
[41:54] stepmom he said oh no wait a minute that
[41:57] ain't
[41:58] right right but he got a Grace because
[42:01] the boy got right and come back into the
[42:04] church amen oh boy we wouldn't we
[42:06] wouldn't like that would
[42:08] we huh thank you Lord but brother
[42:12] brandham comes God knew we'd get in all
[42:14] kind of Scruples and scrapples as
[42:16] brother R would say he says scrapples
[42:19] and he knew that we would need Grace to
[42:21] carry
[42:22] on cuz we got in brother R said
[42:24] misinterpret the theology right
[42:28] yeah coming from where right here that's
[42:32] right all those years that well that's
[42:34] okay and then no we need to somehow some
[42:37] way keep this thing clean yes sir but
[42:39] you got to have Grace cuz we're all
[42:41] messed up I don't care if you've never
[42:43] had a problem in your life you born
[42:45] messed
[42:46] up something had to die for you to get
[42:49] born again that's right that was the old
[42:51] you that older damic nature you were
[42:53] born with that's right
[42:57] so God sent Grace in every
[43:00] age but really in this last age he
[43:03] really sent Grace because this is the
[43:04] whing up of it no time to play no time
[43:07] to go to another another we don't look
[43:09] for another Messenger to to to
[43:10] straighten up brother
[43:12] brandham no that messenger came from
[43:16] with the mind of God just like we said
[43:18] that message was proclaimed and it was a
[43:20] distinct and declared message brother B
[43:23] tells us he says look he says uh in um
[43:27] um spoken words Original Seed he said I
[43:30] thought I preached it all I thought you
[43:31] know I thought I was just here to
[43:33] restore the gifts to restore order
[43:36] brother and then the Bible says or Bible
[43:39] then brother um Bram said the Holy Ghost
[43:41] said pick up your pants said as of yet
[43:43] Mal for has not been fulfilled in other
[43:45] words the seals have not been open the
[43:47] greatest Grace it was ever given to us
[43:49] is the seals when they open I said when
[43:51] they open not greasy Grace to do what
[43:53] you want to but if you get the seals
[43:55] right
[43:58] brother Keith Reed called me yesterday
[44:00] he's coming um the last Sunday in July
[44:03] before camp meeting but he had just got
[44:06] back from Uganda he had been there
[44:07] almost two two to three weeks and uh he
[44:10] was telling them about uh he I had went
[44:13] over there in 2007 I think it was and
[44:15] preached a week week long series on the
[44:19] seals how it was the Plan of Redemption
[44:22] not that it was just a white horse rider
[44:23] with the Antichrist and all that and he
[44:26] said still had those notes and he said I
[44:28] took them over there and he said them
[44:30] pastors when they got finished he said
[44:31] they told me they had to go back to
[44:33] their church and repr preach a lot of
[44:35] stuff we don't know what God's given us
[44:37] and I didn't preach it myself I got it
[44:40] from Brother what brother Dale had
[44:41] already preached back in the
[44:43] 80s 80s some of you wasn't even born in
[44:46] the
[44:47] 80s you see what God's done Among Us
[44:51] he's G us a message but this message
[44:53] goes everywhere it just doesn't right
[44:55] it's not just right here it's for
[44:56] everybody brother Keith always told
[44:58] Brother Dale he always told Brother Dell
[45:01] he said brother Dale you're not only
[45:02] preaching to those people in in Lula he
[45:05] said you're preaching of the
[45:07] world met people over there in Uganda
[45:10] that was that had listened to Us
[45:12] online so praise God thank you Brothers
[45:15] in the back I know we got we've had a
[45:18] lot of issues but thank God we've got
[45:19] what we got all right and we're working
[45:22] on some stuff to keep this all this from
[45:25] uh from not happening anymore so the
[45:28] true word of God it become there's a
[45:29] spiritual war now there's a spiritual
[45:31] war there's been a spiritual war in
[45:33] every Church age all right because it's
[45:35] true word versus false Doctrine it's not
[45:38] it's not whether you believe you know
[45:40] you're a Democrat or
[45:43] Republican it's the true word versus
[45:46] false Doctrine and we're going to see in
[45:47] these Church ages that in the first
[45:49] three ages it was the lion the boldness
[45:52] they would stand up and Proclaim there's
[45:54] only one God I watched somebody
[45:56] yesterday online it came up on YouTube
[45:59] it says Pastor explains to
[46:01] Trinity Heavenly
[46:06] days he held his hand up right here he
[46:08] said there's Father Son and Holy Ghost
[46:11] three persons in the godhead he said
[46:13] then God made Adam Eve and
[46:17] children I said that proves the
[46:23] godhead everybody was
[46:27] how false can you
[46:29] be but you know what misinterpreted
[46:31] theology that's what did it that's why
[46:34] in the first church age that's why in
[46:35] the second Church age Third Church age
[46:36] you had Paul irenius and Martin that
[46:39] knew there was only one true and living
[46:40] God and that's what they preached but
[46:42] then you had those other people the
[46:43] false people that was trying to preach
[46:46] the same thing listen during Paul's age
[46:49] I may not get anywhere today but we're
[46:50] going to get this far Paul's age he
[46:52] would he preached about a an out
[46:55] resurrection and and then a group of
[46:57] people started
[46:58] preaching the resurrection had already
[47:01] happened according to what Paul preached
[47:04] right remember what Martin Luther
[47:05] remember in the movie you know they're
[47:07] burning churches and dragging uh people
[47:10] BR dragging the preachers out and
[47:12] burning the churches up and Luther say
[47:14] what are y'all doing they said we're
[47:15] doing what you
[47:16] said they misinterpreted what the
[47:19] messenger said have we got that in the
[47:21] same age
[47:24] now messed up the message is not messed
[47:27] up it's the people that are messed up
[47:30] that's in the message all right but it's
[47:32] always true everything even when even
[47:35] when Satan was
[47:37] created and he preached a false Doctrine
[47:41] to those angels every how many billions
[47:43] of years back listen you got to remember
[47:45] one thing eternity goes as far backwards
[47:47] as it does forward right we're talking
[47:50] we're thinking about oh and you know no
[47:51] it's always back there too but there's a
[47:54] time when Satan was created well when
[47:56] Satan was created he preached a false
[47:58] Doctrine to Angels they accepted him and
[48:01] it's been War ever
[48:03] since till today but today the battle in
[48:08] this age the battle ends yes right the
[48:11] battle will stop when the bride goes up
[48:14] in the glory for us for the Gentiles we
[48:18] think about these wars in uh Ukraine and
[48:21] Lebanese and the syrians and all these
[48:23] people I hope that doesn't frustrate you
[48:27] I hope that gives you a calm feeling
[48:29] that we know what's going to happen and
[48:31] we know who's going to be involved right
[48:34] brother Brown said watch
[48:37] Russia Russia and Iran are just like
[48:39] this that's right who do you think's fun
[48:42] in Iran
[48:45] Russia it's later than we
[48:50] think so the messenger then is laid away
[48:52] or taken off the
[48:54] Earth and we either accept it or reject
[48:57] it and then that brings a judgment or a
[48:59] plague like it did to the denominations
[49:01] when brother Brown said they're just
[49:03] lodges now if we believe brother R was a
[49:06] prophet then they can't go any further
[49:08] than being a lodge now they're filled
[49:11] up that they're filled
[49:13] up uh Joel Olstein 15,000 members um
[49:17] 6,000 members 4,000 members you
[49:22] know that's huge and they believe what
[49:25] that guy says absolutely
[49:29] that's how deceived that Satan has
[49:32] become remember where Satan seed
[49:36] is it's either in you if you're not born
[49:41] again you're not born again it's in you
[49:44] Satan is sitting right there today if
[49:46] you're not born
[49:47] again sorry it's either truth or false
[49:50] one of the two there's no in between
[49:52] that's right you could be heading toward
[49:54] something which I pre I I pray that
[49:56] we're all heading towards more of God
[49:59] yes sir all right don't just be
[50:01] discouraged you could be Sanctified you
[50:02] could be justified and Satan's still be
[50:05] there but you know that you can't stay
[50:07] that way you got to continue
[50:10] on things I used to do I do them what no
[50:15] more I wanted
[50:18] to oh I'm sorry I wanted to y'all didn't
[50:21] we're
[50:24] fine and that thing still pops up every

[50:45] microwave right we're in a we're in a
[50:47] but we're moving toward something don't

[50:57] what I tell you check the boxes come
[51:00] amen check the boxes you say you're too
[51:03] legalist check your
[51:05] box you can call me whatever you want to
[51:07] call me but I believe and if you're
[51:09] going to come to church you need come on
[51:12] time cuz you bring every devil in the
[51:14] world with you in
[51:18] here I wish there was a little water
[51:20] thing running down where just wash it
[51:22] all the way and we just walk in when we
[51:23] wanted to
[51:27] reach over and pinch yourself you are
[51:29] not in a dream you're in a
[51:32] fight all right but that mystery you and
[51:34] I have we've got a mystery that came
[51:37] from gone to a little Prophet so that so
[51:40] that brother randam would be not he'd be
[51:42] the one where wouldn't mess it
[51:44] up they wouldn't be three or four and
[51:46] they all get up and say well I don't
[51:47] believe no they sent us a prophet yes
[51:50] that Prophet told us what God the mind
[51:52] of God he told us that mind of God and
[51:56] you and I have got a responsibility to
[51:58] either do it or not there's your
[52:01] spiritual war but that mystery is
[52:03] unfolded and Paul tells us what part of
[52:05] the mystery is is Christ in you the hope
[52:08] of glory
[52:09] yes so then there was an age of
[52:12] Pentecost the Holy Ghost fell that Lion
[52:15] of the tribe of Judah that first beast
[52:19] of the four
[52:20] creatures everybody with me it fell on
[52:24] the day of Pentecost and they come out
[52:25] of that what they were they were behind
[52:28] the door had everything shut for fear
[52:31] that they would be they W going to be
[52:32] persecuted by the come on people the
[52:35] Romans were not persecuting them it said
[52:37] for the fear of the
[52:38] Jews the Jews wanted them
[52:42] dead listen the people out in the world
[52:44] don't want you dead but religious people
[52:46] are going to kill us all if we don't
[52:48] take a Rapture I mean a body change
[52:51] religious people religious is what put
[52:54] Jesus on the cross absolutely
[52:56] Rome uh well he tried to not brother
[52:59] John he tried well I can't find no fault
[53:01] in this guy crucify him crucify him
[53:03] crucify him he just happened to yield to
[53:06] the will of the people which were Jews
[53:08] right so the Holy Ghost fell on a group
[53:11] of Believers and what's the first thing
[53:12] they did they bust the doors open as
[53:15] brother R said they run out into the
[53:17] streets and they're like man these
[53:19] people are
[53:20] drunk well 15 minutes earlier they were
[53:24] cowards there you go yeah so the whole
[53:26] Holy Ghost gave him boldness to speak
[53:28] the word of God Silver and Gold Have I
[53:31] None but such as I have give I unto thee
[53:33] rise up and walk in the name of Jesus
[53:35] Christ that was the beginning or the
[53:40] precursor to the Gentile Church age
[53:43] called Ephesus because remember there
[53:44] was an age of Pentecost Peter was a
[53:46] spokesperson there was no messenger the
[53:47] messenger was the Holy Ghost to the
[53:49] people all right it'll be important
[53:51] later on when we get to this the
[53:53] Ephesian Church age we know that Paul
[53:55] was the the um founder there at Ephesus
[53:58] at the church he pastored a little while
[54:00] and then he went and did Mission work
[54:02] and then John comes back John the
[54:03] Revelator he passers there until he dies
[54:06] we saw all the the characteristics of
[54:08] the Ephesian the very city of Ephesus is
[54:11] just like us now Rich increased with
[54:14] goods and all different
[54:15] things and Paul died around 6467 and the
[54:19] church age went on to 170 somebody I
[54:21] hope somebody get somebody had to carry
[54:23] that thing on and they didn't have MP3
[54:27] YouTube they didn't have um
[54:31] recorders amen the only recorders they
[54:34] had was scribes and they I ain't never
[54:36] seen a scribe right that
[54:38] fast they get to preaching the Holy
[54:41] Ghost had to Quicken what you
[54:43] heard is there any different now no no
[54:47] well the only difference is is no wait a
[54:50] minute you misquoted
[54:53] that I got it right here not on this one
[54:55] but y'all got Apple raise up your hand
[54:57] if you got an Apple
[54:58] Watch raise up your hand if you got an
[55:00] Apple
[55:02] Watch don't be looking up quotes in
[55:07] church but I mean that's what you can do
[55:10] now but what about if you didn't have
[55:12] that what if you what if you what if me
[55:14] and brother Dar brother Dy brother
[55:16] Kylie listen to what brother Dale said
[55:18] for all those years and then we go sit
[55:22] somewhere and and we don't have the mind
[55:25] of Christ we we we formulate our own
[55:28] opinion I believe that brother Dale
[55:30] meant this well I believe brother Dale
[55:32] meant this well I know he meant
[55:34] this somewhere the Holy Ghost had to put
[55:37] that thing
[55:38] together regardless of paper right
[55:42] regardless of tape yes regardless of MP3
[55:47] Apple phones that you can look up quotes
[55:49] regardless of that God's got to Quicken
[55:52] what you
[55:53] hear faith comes by
[55:57] no it doesn't come back Apple
[56:01] watches so all y'all are lost except in
[56:03] five people raise your hand up no faith
[56:05] comes by
[56:07] hearing do you ever ask the Lord to
[56:10] reveal what that man saying to
[56:13] you I do man when I first come back to
[56:17] church there in the late 90s dad was
[56:21] laying it hard and heavy and I'm like
[56:23] Lord I got to catch up but if you'll
[56:26] open up your heart not to YouTube but if
[56:29] you'll open up your heart to God and say
[56:31] God I am right here I'm not going
[56:34] anywhere I want to understand what this
[56:36] man's
[56:39] saying that's why a lot of people can't
[56:42] understand brother Dale they don't open
[56:45] their heart or they don't have the Holy
[56:47] Ghost
[56:48] right
[56:50] sorry cuz remember if the Holy Ghost is
[56:53] speaking then there's got to be a holy
[56:55] ghost to to respond ab and if you don't
[56:58] have the Holy Ghost how you going to
[57:00] respond now you can do like brother Luis
[57:02] he's not here today but he'll tell you
[57:03] he sat here he said for 6 to8 months and
[57:06] he just absolutely was brain dead right
[57:09] he never heard these things
[57:12] before and like those Brothers in Uganda
[57:14] they never heard the seals preached like
[57:16] that before we heard it in
[57:19] 1982 they never heard it this is
[57:22] 2024 and they got a listen voice of God
[57:25] don't need even print books anymore they
[57:27] sold all their printing presses they
[57:29] print zero
[57:31] books it's all in digital form now so
[57:35] but but that's great CU it's available
[57:36] to anybody we used to remember those
[57:39] little ebooks we used to buy and they
[57:40] were outrageous but you would take them
[57:42] and they'd wear them out cuz they really
[57:45] wanted to listen to what God Said
[57:46] through the prophet then they went to
[57:49] mp3s and then they went to that uh
[57:51] message Hub where you could print books
[57:53] out of one computer and that was great
[57:56] but now everybody's got them I mean
[57:58] those people overseas they're not behind
[58:01] I'll promise you that you know why cuz
[58:04] they're different than us L out of seean
[58:05] Americans they
[58:07] [Music]
[58:09] study a
[58:10] lot CU that's all they got don't don't
[58:13] ever don't ever go to a foreign country
[58:16] and think they don't know what you
[58:19] know but it took somebody like brother
[58:21] Keith though to place it
[58:23] together to show them that the seals is
[58:26] for the Redemption of their
[58:28] body and how the brother Dale preached
[58:30] it there in the ' 80s and we were
[58:32] absolutely fortunate to do that in 2007
[58:35] I want to ask you a question remember
[58:36] when brother Dale used to give us quotes
[58:39] yes well everybody just hang on a
[58:42] minute you still got them you ever read
[58:45] them you even know where they're
[58:47] at I figured you did Brother
[58:50] Kylie some of you did too but but I
[58:53] preached that in 2007
[58:56] in Jamaica and I took everybody a copy I
[59:00] went with a whole um suitcase full of
[59:04] what I had run off here it was like 15
[59:07] pages cuz I did quotes charts graphs
[59:10] went all the way through the the statue
[59:12] of perfect man went through the four
[59:14] horse riders went through a little bit
[59:16] of Daniel 70 weeks and then got into the
[59:18] seals and it took to me it took six
[59:20] nights
[59:22] preaching 2 and 1 half hours a night
[59:25] they didn't care
[59:26] there we get to church at 7:00 that s
[59:29] till
[59:30] 8:30 most of y'all already asleep by
[59:32] then you're asleep
[59:34] now then we'd start service and i' I'd
[59:37] go and they' just say keep going keep
[59:39] going keep going and it'd be midnight
[59:40] when we get finished then they had to
[59:42] drive it I had to drive an hour Keith
[59:45] did an hour back home and they filled
[59:48] the church
[59:49] fall I'm not saying nothing about me I'm
[59:51] just saying listen somebody kept those
[59:53] notes right and they used them for the
[59:56] glory of God they didn't put him up
[59:58] somewhere they didn't tear him up they
[59:59] didn't throw him
[1:00:01] away it's like brother Keith said and
[1:00:03] I'll tell you just playing he said we
[1:00:05] don't realize what we've already
[1:00:09] got remember what brother um Andrew
[1:00:12] Glover said and it's a quote where
[1:00:13] brother B says I don't think we are
[1:00:15] sufficiently impressed with what we
[1:00:19] got and it's in the pergan church age I
[1:00:22] think we're we're we're not we're not
[1:00:23] impressed that this message is is just
[1:00:26] for a group of people that God chose
[1:00:28] before the foundation of world that we
[1:00:30] would hear this message and respond to
[1:00:32] it yes right we're not impressed I mean
[1:00:35] you but you can get a big head over here
[1:00:37] on this side let's don't do that let's
[1:00:40] be humble that God was that God saw that
[1:00:42] you would try yes I just want us to
[1:00:46] try to live the a good a good life and
[1:00:49] check the boxes and and stand still and
[1:00:52] wait on
[1:00:53] God Amen
[1:00:56] you read that thing right there y'all
[1:00:58] can see it I can't be still and know
[1:01:00] that I am God do you know he's one God
[1:01:02] do you know where he's at do you know
[1:01:03] what he's
[1:01:04] doing are you sufficiently impressed
[1:01:07] with what you
[1:01:08] got
[1:01:10] wow but God's give us a shepherd He that
[1:01:13] entereth in by the door is The Shepherd
[1:01:15] of the sheep to him the porter openeth
[1:01:17] the Sheep hears voice and he cth his own
[1:01:19] Sheep by name he called you by name and
[1:01:23] led you out and when he put forth his
[1:01:26] own sheep he doeth before the goeth
[1:01:28] before them and the Sheep follow him for
[1:01:30] they know his voice today I want you to
[1:01:33] hear the voice of God it's not going to
[1:01:35] do us any good to hear the voice of
[1:01:36] brother Dale the voice of way Dale the
[1:01:38] voice of brother Bob listen to what's
[1:01:41] behind that voice listen to the essence
[1:01:44] of what's trying God's trying to get to
[1:01:45] you I've always said this message is not
[1:01:49] in 1100 sermons written on a piece of
[1:01:51] paper our on magnetic form are now in
[1:01:54] your digital pocket
[1:01:57] it's the essence of that message that's
[1:02:00] going to live in a group of people amen
[1:02:03] and then that's going to turn and carry
[1:02:05] us in a
[1:02:06] Rapture but he's got to turn from you
[1:02:09] and carry it to the Rapture that's it
[1:02:13] how can you hide it under a
[1:02:15] bushel how can you hide it in Earthly
[1:02:17] vessels now God hid it in Earthly
[1:02:19] vessels which is me and you but remember
[1:02:22] who was it Gideon or somebody told him
[1:02:24] God told him put the candle inside the
[1:02:26] Earth and Bethel and when you got up
[1:02:27] shout and hit that thing and knock it
[1:02:29] out and the light would shine and they
[1:02:31] think there was hundreds of thousands of
[1:02:33] troops there was only 300 of them and
[1:02:35] they whipped like 50,000 fistin or
[1:02:37] whoever it was they were in a battle
[1:02:39] with because they broke the
[1:02:42] Potter and let the light
[1:02:46] shine you know I read a quote the other
[1:02:48] day where it went from Brother brown but
[1:02:50] was somebody else that said your light
[1:02:52] only really shines through the scars
[1:02:55] right
[1:02:58] amen your light only really shines
[1:03:00] through the scars you make a scar and
[1:03:02] there's light inside of you how did we
[1:03:05] get out of the side of
[1:03:08] Jesus a Roman
[1:03:11] spear cut him open and brother Brown
[1:03:14] said water and blood came forth he said
[1:03:17] that was the bride the releasing of the
[1:03:19] Bride praise
[1:03:22] God and it stayed open so that we can
[1:03:25] get back in
[1:03:27] remember Adam's got sealed
[1:03:29] up Jesus has still got
[1:03:32] the he's still got the scar and through
[1:03:35] that scar shines me and you through our
[1:03:39] scars shines the
[1:03:42] light to him the Porter openeth and the
[1:03:44] sheep hear his voice and he calleth his
[1:03:46] own Sheep by name and leadth them out
[1:03:49] and he wh when he put putteth forth his
[1:03:51] own sheep he goeth before them and the
[1:03:53] Sheep follow him for they know his voice
[1:03:56] and a stranger will they not follow but
[1:03:58] will flee from him for they know not the
[1:04:01] voice of
[1:04:03] strangers Hebrews 13:20 says now the God
[1:04:06] of Peace that brought again from the
[1:04:07] dead our lord Jesus that great Shepherd
[1:04:10] of the sheep so let's just take say
[1:04:11] today God is The Shepherd of all these
[1:04:14] sheep all right he's the great Shepherd
[1:04:16] he's the one that doesn't make a mistake
[1:04:19] through the blood of the Everlasting
[1:04:20] Covenant look make you perfect in every
[1:04:24] good work to do his will will working in
[1:04:27] you that which is well pleasing in his
[1:04:29] sight through Jesus Christ to him be
[1:04:31] glory forever and ever amen 1 Peter 5:2
[1:04:35] says feed the flock of God this is where
[1:04:37] he's talking to pastors as myself and
[1:04:39] his brother Dale different ones feed the
[1:04:41] flock of God now watch which is among
[1:04:43] you taking the oversight thereof there's
[1:04:45] got to be listen we got I was talking
[1:04:47] Sunday there we're not an organization
[1:04:49] we're an organism an organism has moving
[1:04:53] Parts but there's got to be somebody
[1:04:55] that's got to be held

[1:04:59] person held accountable then the next
[1:05:01] person held
[1:05:02] accountable everybody with me that's
[1:05:05] just the way God set it up he gave some
[1:05:07] Apostles prophets pastors teachers and
[1:05:08] evangelist for what for the perfecting
[1:05:10] of the Saints all right now look not by
[1:05:13] constraint but willingly not for filthy
[1:05:16] looker but of a ready mind neither as
[1:05:19] being Lords over God's Heritage but
[1:05:22] being examples to the flock amen and
[1:05:26] when the chief Shepherd shall appear ye
[1:05:29] shall receive a crown not him you shall
[1:05:33] receive a Crown of Glory that fadeth not
[1:05:36] away listen we're not going to be
[1:05:37] walking around with a bunch of crowns on
[1:05:38] her
[1:05:40] head right a symbolism of what's inside
[1:05:43] of you in your intelligence you know
[1:05:47] listen God knows whether you want it or
[1:05:49] not you just got to figure out whether
[1:05:51] you want it or
[1:05:54] not so let's look at these amen just for
[1:05:57] a minute we got a Pentecostal age
[1:05:59] Ephesus smna pergamus now I'm going to
[1:06:02] skip real quick because I want to I
[1:06:03] don't want to be too long today um but
[1:06:06] we we've seen the church ages we've seen
[1:06:08] Ephesus we've seen Smyrna Smyrna meant
[1:06:10] what bitter death I still want to read
[1:06:11] that cuz look in Ephesus look at all
[1:06:14] that light that was the preaching of the
[1:06:17] unadulterated word of God coming
[1:06:20] straight from Paul and Peter and James
[1:06:22] and John all the different ones right
[1:06:24] from Jesus the chief Shepherd had had
[1:06:26] just left am and it was fresh on their
[1:06:29] mind it was fresh in their heart they
[1:06:32] had not had as Paul said Grievous wolves
[1:06:34] had not come in right at the first it
[1:06:37] was a pure
[1:06:38] age a lot of light then look at the next
[1:06:42] stage a little bit more
[1:06:45] dark a lot of people accepted false
[1:06:48] teaching a lot of people accepted false
[1:06:51] Doctrine look they didn't accept it and
[1:06:53] say hey there's nobody I know of that
[1:06:56] says hey my Doctrine is different from
[1:06:58] yours mine's false and yours is
[1:06:59] true hello somebody they always say my
[1:07:03] Doctrine is true and yours is false amen
[1:07:05] everybody wants to be
[1:07:08] right but look at the next age the
[1:07:11] pergan church age the light's getting
[1:07:14] getting dimmer then in Columbus it
[1:07:17] almost goes completely out and we'll
[1:07:20] look at that in just a minute but I want
[1:07:21] to talk about the the U lonox man and
[1:07:25] eagle
[1:07:26] but the Smyrna Church age means bitter
[1:07:27] so what in Smyrna what happened brother
[1:07:29] R said look there's a twofold
[1:07:31] significance found in the name of this
[1:07:33] age it was bitter filled with death look
[1:07:35] the two Vines within the framework of
[1:07:38] the church were drifting further apart
[1:07:40] with an increased bitterness toward the
[1:07:41] True Vine on part of the false listen
[1:07:44] there start to be more and more
[1:07:45] persecution right yeah and who
[1:07:48] persecutes
[1:07:50] who Christians
[1:07:53] so-called persecute Christians
[1:07:55] that's why I thank God uh he sent us a
[1:07:57] prophet that said look bride will not
[1:08:00] persecute
[1:08:02] bride you can't persecute the Holy Ghost
[1:08:04] if you got it inside of you now if you
[1:08:06] don't have
[1:08:12] it you will
[1:08:15] persecute death was not only the seed of
[1:08:17] the false Vine but even in the True Vine
[1:08:20] now look even in the True Vine there was
[1:08:22] a creeping paralysis and impotence
[1:08:25] because they had already drifted from
[1:08:27] the unadulterated truth of the first few
[1:08:29] years after Pentecost and no True
[1:08:32] Believer is any stronger and spiritually
[1:08:34] healthy and Alive than his knowledge of
[1:08:38] and adherence to the pure word of God
[1:08:40] everybody with me that's a good
[1:08:42] quote you're no more alive you're no
[1:08:45] more stronger than the word that you
[1:08:47] take in that's truth now you take in
[1:08:50] garbage it makes you
[1:08:52] weak hello somebody garbage in garbage
[1:08:55] Gage out what we always say in the world
[1:08:56] garbage in garbage
[1:08:59] out that's seen by multitudes of
[1:09:01] examples in the Old Testament we saw
[1:09:03] that organization was growing a pace
[1:09:04] confirming and augmenting the death of
[1:09:07] the membership for Holy Ghost leadership
[1:09:09] was deposed and the Word was replaced by
[1:09:12] Creeds dogmas and man-made rituals and
[1:09:15] that age started at 170 to 312 the
[1:09:17] messenger was irenius we know that let's
[1:09:20] just keep going here real
[1:09:22] quick now listen when we get to this
[1:09:25] when we talk about this morning the
[1:09:26] church age there is the chief Shepherd
[1:09:28] of the flock but does he hold back
[1:09:30] persecution
[1:09:31] no no he does
[1:09:34] not I know your tribulation not I'm
[1:09:36] going to get you out
[1:09:38] that's but the present suffering Paul
[1:09:40] said of this time is not to be compared
[1:09:43] to the glory absolutely amen whatever
[1:09:46] your flesh desires today will go
[1:09:50] away it'll either burn in hell or be
[1:09:53] changed one of the two amen
[1:09:56] absolutely amen we still believe in a
[1:09:58] burnt
[1:09:59] hell okay but what a stumbling block it
[1:10:03] is to so many people that's why that
[1:10:06] this Prosperity Doctrine and all these
[1:10:08] different things that yeah they got
[1:10:09] their place why because they don't have
[1:10:11] the Holy Ghost to combat
[1:10:13] it the only thing you got to combat
[1:10:15] false Doctrine is is the Holy Ghost
[1:10:17] absolutely the four creatures the four
[1:10:20] living creatures and listen we're in the
[1:10:21] end time all four Hallelujah
[1:10:26] are at our
[1:10:28] disposal the
[1:10:29] lion Matthew Mark Luke and John or or
[1:10:33] Matthew in that first church age they
[1:10:36] couldn't be an eagle they could have an
[1:10:39] eagle anointing God has dispensations we
[1:10:41] know
[1:10:42] that but you know have you ever thought
[1:10:44] about this though the reason we have the
[1:10:47] the reason
[1:10:49] God's segments this put something
[1:10:52] segments or dispensations is for me and
[1:10:54] you to understand it
[1:10:56] if he just flowed through and like you
[1:10:58] know I'm
[1:10:59] just no he says all right understand
[1:11:01] this that's why that's why I love these
[1:11:03] Church AG if you just keep reading them
[1:11:05] just keep reading what God Said in the
[1:11:06] scripture but that's what brother Bram
[1:11:08] said read what God wrote to all these
[1:11:10] and he gave that message he said this is
[1:11:13] a way you're going to
[1:11:16] act
[1:11:19] lukewarm BL to
[1:11:21] see
[1:11:23] blind wretched
[1:11:25] miserable naked and don't know
[1:11:28] it that's what he said every age got the
[1:11:32] good and the
[1:11:33] bad but remember in the Lan age we don't
[1:11:36] get any good it's all
[1:11:42] bad but he may commit you to
[1:11:46] death come on now he may commit you to
[1:11:49] death as he did Paul that's right he may
[1:11:52] commit you to suffer as he did job that
[1:11:55] is his prerogative for he is Sovereign
[1:11:58] but it is all with a
[1:12:01] purpose if he did not have a purpose
[1:12:03] then he would be the author of
[1:12:04] frustration I want to add that confusion
[1:12:07] also and not of Peace his purpose is
[1:12:10] that after we have suffered after we
[1:12:13] have suffered a while we would be made
[1:12:16] perfect established strengthened and
[1:12:18] settled yes listen I believe brother ROM
[1:12:21] said and I'm going to bring that quote
[1:12:23] where he says that when the doors of the
[1:12:25] Gentile Church Clos he said God will
[1:12:26] anoint a church then and God will do in
[1:12:29] one year what theologists has tried to
[1:12:31] do in 2000 look what we got
[1:12:34] coming amen there's going to be a time
[1:12:37] just for a
[1:12:39] moment just for a moment brother Joe
[1:12:42] God's going to show the world the
[1:12:44] bride that's right he didn't have to
[1:12:46] show her all down Through the
[1:12:48] Ages cuz they weren't as dark as this
[1:12:51] age right most deceiving worst day is
[1:12:55] this day and we're getting ready to go
[1:12:57] home and I believe God's going to uh you
[1:12:59] know we we've all got issues we all got
[1:13:01] things we got to work on but if you'll
[1:13:03] get in the right place at the right time
[1:13:04] be at the bus station have your bus
[1:13:06] ticket have your bus ticket not at the
[1:13:10] airplane counter be at the bus ticket
[1:13:13] check all the boxes yes ask God for
[1:13:16] Revelation yes amen God is going to show
[1:13:20] the world you and I just for a moment
[1:13:24] amen he's going to say there's where
[1:13:26] I've been there's where I live there's
[1:13:29] where I spend all my three and 1/2 years
[1:13:32] preaching so I could be in that group of
[1:13:34] people right
[1:13:36] there praise
[1:13:38] God and we know he's going to go to the
[1:13:40] Jews but remember they turned him down
[1:13:42] that's why they turn around and they say
[1:13:43] oh Lord we're in
[1:13:46] trouble cuz you know what those two
[1:13:48] witnesses are going to do they're going
[1:13:49] to go hey you see what that group there
[1:13:52] was a group fresh on their mind cuz we
[1:13:55] just go up in a Rapture don't you
[1:13:57] remember that group that called
[1:14:00] fire that group that had many people
[1:14:03] that were limping in the church didn't
[1:14:04] limp no
[1:14:06] more many people didn't have limbs
[1:14:09] brother R said limbs would be
[1:14:14] restored but it's all done for a
[1:14:20] purpose he said for I reckon the
[1:14:22] sufferings of this present time are not
[1:14:24] worthy to be compare with the glory
[1:14:25] which shall be what revealed in US
[1:14:29] unless we suffer with him we cannot
[1:14:30] reign with him you have to suffer to
[1:14:32] rain the reason for this is that
[1:14:34] character simply is never made listen we
[1:14:37] are spoiled brats if we don't get
[1:14:43] corrected who said that's it who said
[1:14:46] that that's exactly right brother that's
[1:14:50] it we know for a fact if we had no
[1:14:53] control
[1:14:55] come on somebody I'm talking to
[1:14:57] Christians today if even if we have no
[1:15:01] control what will we
[1:15:03] do that's why I said you wait till you
[1:15:06] think it's lawlessness now and they'll
[1:15:09] just ride over anything turn cars over
[1:15:11] and you know destroy Walmart and all
[1:15:14] kind of stuff just over somebody saying
[1:15:16] a racial
[1:15:17] something you wait till the Holy Ghost
[1:15:20] leave and there's nobody in the United
[1:15:22] States that has the Holy Ghost in their
[1:15:24] soul I'm just talking about the United
[1:15:26] States I ain't talking about over
[1:15:27] under nobody will have a restraint Dog
[1:15:31] Eat Dog they'll shoot and kill each
[1:15:33] other they'll steal your
[1:15:35] food and not think a thing about it you
[1:15:37] said I said that's Christian so
[1:15:41] so-called you know what's holding the
[1:15:42] wrath of God away me and you cuz he's
[1:15:46] not going to pour wrath that he says
[1:15:48] he's going to pour out on them that
[1:15:49] don't believe him he's not pouring it
[1:15:51] out on them till he takes you home moves
[1:15:54] us over in a Master Dimension to let
[1:15:55] this thing clean off we're going to step
[1:15:57] right back into this
[1:15:58] Dimension we're going to be a marriage
[1:16:00] supper though we're going to take
[1:16:01] communion for 3 and A2 years and and
[1:16:03] find out who who made it who didn't talk
[1:16:06] about our Lord he's right there wipe all
[1:16:10] of our tears
[1:16:12] away the reason for this is that
[1:16:14] character simply is never made without
[1:16:16] suffering character is a victory not a
[1:16:19] gift a man without character can't Reign
[1:16:21] because power apart from character is
[1:16:24] satanic
[1:16:25] but Power with character is fit to rule
[1:16:28] and since he wants us to share even his
[1:16:32] throne he wants you to sit right there
[1:16:35] with him in his throne not on his
[1:16:39] throne then we have to overcome to sit
[1:16:41] with him and the little temporary
[1:16:43] sufferings we go through now is not
[1:16:44] worthy to be compared to the tremendous
[1:16:46] Glory that will be what revealed in us
[1:16:49] when he comes oh what Treasures are laid
[1:16:52] up for those who are willing to enter
[1:16:53] into his kingdom through much
[1:16:56] tribulation thinking not strange
[1:16:57] concerning the fiery trials that are to
[1:17:00] try you that's what Peter said is it
[1:17:03] strange that God wants us to develop a
[1:17:05] Christlike character that comes through
[1:17:06] suffering no sir and we all have trials
[1:17:09] we're all tried and chasen his sons not
[1:17:12] one but goes through it the church that
[1:17:14] is not
[1:17:16] suffering and is not being tried isn't
[1:17:20] of
[1:17:23] God he I believe brother B was a prophet
[1:17:26] right okay all right the church that's
[1:17:28] not suffering and is not being tried
[1:17:31] hasn't got it it
[1:17:33] isn't of
[1:17:35] God I'm going to continue on we'll let's
[1:17:37] get to this just for a
[1:17:40] moment I'll back up but I want to I want
[1:17:42] to talk about just for a minute talk
[1:17:44] about these four creatures just for a
[1:17:46] minute okay now what I want to show you
[1:17:49] is is we've come now we we're in we're
[1:17:51] almost getting toward the fourth Church
[1:17:52] age so we're almost in the middle of the
[1:17:54] church ages getting ready to come to
[1:17:56] where we have a whole lot of information
[1:17:59] with Luther Wesley and and Pentecost and
[1:18:01] brother brandom we don't have a whole
[1:18:03] lot from their back but thank God for a
[1:18:05] prophet that found it somewhere in the
[1:18:08] history and was able to pick the church
[1:18:10] age Messengers but what happened is God
[1:18:13] released these four
[1:18:15] creatures watching The Book of Ezekiel
[1:18:17] we'll go through this real quick and
[1:18:19] I'll get back with it next week I won't
[1:18:21] cover it
[1:18:22] all let's read right here Ezekiel 1
[1:18:24] verse four now this is Ezekiel a prophet
[1:18:27] all right ezekiel's a prophet he's he's
[1:18:30] told to to he's going to go into these
[1:18:32] visions and for him to come out and tell
[1:18:35] the world or tell his people all right
[1:18:38] they with
[1:18:39] me and I looked and behold a whirlwind
[1:18:42] came out of the North a great cloud and
[1:18:44] a fire infolded itself I I was sitting
[1:18:47] here yesterday and and I don't say I got
[1:18:50] caught up in the vision but I've never
[1:18:52] seen it like this before where you just
[1:18:54] literally get it get caught up in this
[1:18:56] and that's what Ezekiel is looking at
[1:18:59] now listen Ezekiel don't have a
[1:19:01] revelation of who Jesus Christ
[1:19:04] [Music]
[1:19:06] is never seen him before knows a
[1:19:09] messiah's coming knows Jehovah's with
[1:19:11] him but never seen him
[1:19:13] before does it really know it's going to
[1:19:16] be in his
[1:19:17] people he just says Israel that's
[1:19:22] it but we know it's more than that and I
[1:19:25] looked and behold a whirlwind came out
[1:19:26] of the North a great Cloud fire and
[1:19:28] folded itself and the brightness was
[1:19:30] about it and out of the midst thereof
[1:19:31] was a color of amber out of the midst of
[1:19:33] fire same amber colored light that was
[1:19:35] over brother brandom is the same Pillar
[1:19:37] of Fire with them back then but watch
[1:19:40] also out of the midst thereof now look
[1:19:43] out of the midst have we we've been
[1:19:45] preaching on in the midst of the golden
[1:19:48] Candlestick one lik un to the son of man
[1:19:52] but I want you to look at this real
[1:19:54] quick
[1:19:55] also out of the midst I want you to get
[1:19:57] caught up in this Vision don't look at
[1:19:59] words you're Ezekiel you're standing
[1:20:01] there and you're looking out into space
[1:20:03] and you see this
[1:20:06] Amber glow in this fire all right
[1:20:09] everybody with me all right also out of
[1:20:12] the midst thereof came the likeness now
[1:20:15] watch you got to really have a
[1:20:18] revelation to understand what he's
[1:20:20] saying right
[1:20:22] here out of the midst thereof came the
[1:20:24] the likeness of four living creatures
[1:20:27] hold on a minute lion ox man and Eagle
[1:20:30] that's what it's going to turn into but
[1:20:32] watch what he
[1:20:35] saw when John turned to see The
[1:20:39] Voice he saw seven candlesticks and in
[1:20:43] the midst of that candlesticks was like
[1:20:44] one lik un to the what son of
[1:20:48] man all right so here's Ezekiel in the
[1:20:51] Old Testament out of the midst of came
[1:20:54] to likeness of four living creatures so
[1:20:56] he looks and sees the likeness of four
[1:20:58] living creatures and this was their
[1:21:03] appearance they had the likeness of a
[1:21:06] man son a
[1:21:09] man but he saw the lion ox man and Eagle
[1:21:12] cuz it says right here came the likeness
[1:21:15] of four living creatures and this was
[1:21:19] their
[1:21:20] appearance they had the likeness of a
[1:21:23] man yeah you and I today have the
[1:21:27] baptism of the Holy Ghost you have those
[1:21:29] four living creatures inside of
[1:21:32] you but I see a
[1:21:35] man and sisters but I see a
[1:21:39] man and everyone had four faces and had
[1:21:42] four wings and their feet were straight
[1:21:45] forward straight feet and the soul of
[1:21:48] their feet was like the sole of a calf's
[1:21:50] foot and they sparkled like the color of
[1:21:51] burnished brass what does brass mean
[1:21:53] judgment
[1:21:55] and they had the hands of a
[1:21:58] man here we go back to that same man
[1:22:01] again
[1:22:03] under their wings on their four
[1:22:07] sides and they four had their faces and
[1:22:11] their wings now remember let me stop
[1:22:12] here just a minute we all know the
[1:22:14] number three is what Perfection number
[1:22:16] seven is completion five is Grace and
[1:22:19] brother Brown calls four an Earthly
[1:22:21] number right right but now it's not a
[1:22:23] bad number right
[1:22:25] right that's right it's a number of
[1:22:29] redemption LS man an eagle justification
[1:22:32] sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost
[1:22:33] and the
[1:22:34] word right and they had the hands of a
[1:22:37] man under the wings on the four side and
[1:22:39] they had their faces and their wings
[1:22:41] their wings were
[1:22:48] joined how about I did I cried when I
[1:22:51] saw this
[1:22:55] I was going to bring it down there but I
[1:22:58] didn't their
[1:23:00] wings remember I told you what the
[1:23:02] church Ages were they weren't
[1:23:05] apart they intertwined each other the
[1:23:08] real true picture should be that every
[1:23:11] one of them are spread
[1:23:13] out and they're all standing there in
[1:23:15] order one One Wing touching the other
[1:23:18] Wing One Wing touching the other wing
[1:23:20] wing One Church AIDS touching the other
[1:23:21] Church AIDS and there's your four beef
[1:23:24] and we'll see in a minute that you
[1:23:27] got
[1:23:28] lion ox man an
[1:23:32] eagle all right everybody with me all
[1:23:36] right so let's see if I can find this
[1:23:39] back down here
[1:23:41] again but I never really stopped and
[1:23:44] read this about Ezekiel till just the
[1:23:46] other
[1:23:48] day but when I when I looked at that
[1:23:50] picture their wings were joined one to
[1:23:52] the other
[1:23:55] they were in harmony they didn't have a
[1:23:57] break in their
[1:24:01] Doctrine their wings were joined one to
[1:24:04] another they turned not when they went
[1:24:07] they went everyone straight
[1:24:09] forward as for the likeness of their
[1:24:11] faces they had four had the face of a
[1:24:14] man face of a lion on the right side
[1:24:17] talking about on the right side they had
[1:24:19] four had the face of an ox on the left
[1:24:20] side they four had the face of an eagle
[1:24:23] all right
[1:24:24] these were their faces and their wings
[1:24:26] were stretched upward two wings of every
[1:24:29] one that were joined one to another and
[1:24:31] two covered their body and they went
[1:24:33] everyone straight forward whether the
[1:24:36] spirit was to go they
[1:24:40] went all right and they turned not
[1:24:44] that's what brother Ryan was asking how
[1:24:45] how can they turn not and there's four
[1:24:47] faces and this looks like there because
[1:24:50] if you if you'll remember the Ark of the
[1:24:52] Covenant set in one place right then you
[1:24:54] had you had three tribes here three
[1:24:56] tribes here three tribes here three
[1:24:58] tribes here you had Dan and the
[1:25:00] different ones and one was the face of a
[1:25:01] line one was an ox one was a man one was
[1:25:03] an eagle but in the Revelation you got
[1:25:06] to understand God's so
[1:25:08] quick he can turn and you never even
[1:25:10] know it cuz God don't go backwards and
[1:25:13] listen these creatures are not just
[1:25:15] attached to God they are God but it's
[1:25:18] where me and you can understand it amen
[1:25:20] listen sometimes I can't understand the
[1:25:23] Holy Ghost I don't know about y'all pray
[1:25:24] for me right I can't understand what he
[1:25:26] does sometimes but I depend on him
[1:25:29] telling me what he's done right you know
[1:25:32] what I ask him to God make me a part of
[1:25:36] that don't leave me make me a part of
[1:25:39] that if you're moving make me a part of
[1:25:41] that
[1:25:42] movement amen is that your desire make
[1:25:45] make me more like
[1:25:47] thee don't separate my wings right don't
[1:25:51] separate me from the Holy Ghost don't
[1:25:53] separate me from love if you got a
[1:25:55] problem get the Holy Ghost if you got
[1:25:57] the Holy Ghost depend on
[1:26:01] him who else you going to depend on give
[1:26:04] me a name that's what I thought somebody
[1:26:08] say
[1:26:09] Biden somebody say
[1:26:12] Trump garbage if they don't get born
[1:26:15] again they'll never see Heaven I don't
[1:26:18] care if they're the greatest people ever
[1:26:19] walk on the face of the Earth they're
[1:26:21] lost that's right and they have Mind of
[1:26:24] a lost person yes
[1:26:27] right and they went everyone straight
[1:26:29] forward whether the spirit was to go
[1:26:32] they went and they turned not when they
[1:26:36] went as for the likeness of the living
[1:26:38] creatures their appearance was liken to
[1:26:40] burning coals of fire and like the
[1:26:42] appearance of lamps and it went up and
[1:26:44] down among the living creatures and the
[1:26:46] fire was bright and out of the fire went
[1:26:48] forth lightning up and down Jacob's
[1:26:52] Ladder remember he saw angels
[1:26:54] ascending and descending ascending and
[1:26:57] descending am and the living creatures
[1:27:01] ran
[1:27:02] ran and returned as the appearance of a
[1:27:06] flash of
[1:27:09] lightning we pray for somebody we we say
[1:27:13] send the Holy Ghost well by the time we
[1:27:14] say send he's already
[1:27:17] there hold on the Holy Ghost is a person
[1:27:19] y'all know that don't you okay all right
[1:27:22] he's in spirit form but he's still Jesus
[1:27:23] Christ
[1:27:24] all right okay I just want know if I
[1:27:26] lost you there for a second and the
[1:27:28] living creatures ran and returned as the
[1:27:29] appearance of a flash of lightning now
[1:27:31] as I beheld the living creatures now
[1:27:33] here's Ezekiel looking at this scene
[1:27:35] behold one wheel upon the Earth by the
[1:27:38] living creatures with his four faces now
[1:27:41] he brings something else in he brings a
[1:27:43] a card in with
[1:27:45] wheels cuz that's his interpretation of
[1:27:49] Jesus Christ
[1:27:51] right amen
[1:27:54] the wheel in the middle of the wheel
[1:27:56] that's right as they travel along
[1:27:59] remember when brother briam said he said
[1:28:01] that brother but that God went and
[1:28:03] knocked on the door of of paradise and
[1:28:06] said Abraham opened the door and said
[1:28:08] Sarah that's the calf that's the man we
[1:28:10] fed the calf to he said Ezekiel looked
[1:28:12] over his shoulder said hey that's a
[1:28:13] wheel in the middle of the wheel his
[1:28:15] Revelation was though that he was in
[1:28:17] that Ark and the Ark was being carried
[1:28:19] by Wheels exactly and the living
[1:28:22] creatures were around him now now that's
[1:28:24] been done away with right we don't have
[1:28:28] oxcart it's inside of me and you that's
[1:28:31] why John didn't see that in the Book of
[1:28:32] Revelation he saw four living
[1:28:35] creatures we'll get to that just really
[1:28:37] quick and we'll get we'll touch it again
[1:28:39] next
[1:28:40] week the appearance of the wheels now
[1:28:43] there's an appearance the appearance of
[1:28:44] the wheels and their work was lik into
[1:28:46] the color of burl we'll get into that I
[1:28:49] don't have time to talk about that and
[1:28:51] they four look and they four had one
[1:28:53] lightning there's only one God that's
[1:28:56] right there's only one way to do this
[1:28:58] yes and their appearance and their work
[1:29:00] was as it was a wheel in the middle of
[1:29:02] the wheel what spinning God's moving all
[1:29:06] the time they might have stopped their
[1:29:08] wheel in the desert but God's still
[1:29:11] turning
[1:29:13] right when they went they went upon
[1:29:16] their four sides and they turned not
[1:29:17] when they went as for their Rings they
[1:29:20] were so high that they were Dreadful and
[1:29:22] their Rings were full of eyes round
[1:29:24] about them four and when the living
[1:29:27] creatures
[1:29:28] went the wheel went with
[1:29:30] them and when the living creatures were
[1:29:32] lifted up from the
[1:29:35] earth the
[1:29:37] bride was lifted up too
[1:29:41] Lord
[1:29:43] listen what's Jesus coming back
[1:29:45] after he's coming back after
[1:29:49] himself he's coming back after himself
[1:29:51] made manifest in another form called a
[1:29:53] bride but is coming back for himself
[1:29:55] amen whatsoever the spirit was to go
[1:29:58] they went whether there was their Spirit
[1:30:00] to go and the wheels were lifted up over
[1:30:03] against them for the spirit of the
[1:30:04] living creatures was in the
[1:30:07] whe Jesus Christ when those went these
[1:30:12] went and when those stood these stood
[1:30:15] and when those were lifted up from the
[1:30:16] earth the wheels were lifted up over
[1:30:19] against them for the spirit of the
[1:30:20] living creature was in those Wheels
[1:30:24] and the likeness of the firmament upon
[1:30:26] the heads of the living creatures was at
[1:30:27] the color of a terrible Crystal
[1:30:29] stretched forth over their heads above
[1:30:31] now if you go back to Revelations 4 John
[1:30:33] saw what a sea of Crystal right it's
[1:30:37] pretty much the same scene it's just a
[1:30:38] higher Revelation coming from the Old
[1:30:40] Testament to the New Testament John saw
[1:30:42] Jesus he knew who Jesus was he knew
[1:30:44] Jesus was the Messiah Ezekiel didn't
[1:30:46] know that right but he was looking at
[1:30:48] the same pretty much the same scene all
[1:30:50] right and under the firmament were their
[1:30:52] wings straight the one toward the other
[1:30:54] everyone had two which covered on this
[1:30:57] side everyone had two which covered on
[1:30:58] that side of their bodies and when they
[1:31:00] went I heard the noise of their
[1:31:05] wings like the noise of Great
[1:31:08] Waters as the voice of the almighty amen
[1:31:14] the voice of
[1:31:17] speech sometimes all we hear is Wings
[1:31:22] fluttering but the there's a voice
[1:31:24] behind that if you're bride there's a
[1:31:27] voice behind that move listen and what
[1:31:29] are wings Wings are Made for two
[1:31:32] things to fly you right and for
[1:31:37] movement if they didn't if they didn't
[1:31:40] flop they wouldn't go nowhere so it's
[1:31:42] movement and when they when they went I
[1:31:45] heard the noise of their wings now
[1:31:46] here's Ezekiel he's probably heard
[1:31:47] thousands of birds
[1:31:49] fluttering but he heard something
[1:31:51] different he heard a noise he Heard a
[1:31:54] Voice the voice of speech as the noise
[1:31:57] of a host when they stood they let down
[1:31:59] their wings and there was a voice from
[1:32:02] the firmament over their head when they
[1:32:03] stood and had let down their wings and
[1:32:06] above the firmament what is it above the
[1:32:08] sky that was over their heads was the
[1:32:10] likeness of a throne now that's what
[1:32:12] John
[1:32:13] saw right as the appearance of a
[1:32:16] sapphire stone and upon the likess of
[1:32:18] the throne was the lightess of the
[1:32:19] appearance of a man the same one John
[1:32:22] saw one sitting on the throne
[1:32:24] in Revelations 4 Ezekiel Saw one sitting
[1:32:27] on the throne in the in the Old
[1:32:29] Testament and I saw as a color of amber
[1:32:32] as the appearance of fire round about
[1:32:33] within from the appearance of his loins
[1:32:35] upward and from the appearance of his
[1:32:37] loins downward I saw as it were the
[1:32:38] appearance of fire and it had brightness
[1:32:41] round
[1:32:42] about as the
[1:32:45] appearance of the
[1:32:47] bow he saw seven different
[1:32:51] colors he saw seven
[1:32:54] different
[1:32:56] colors as the appearance of the bow that
[1:32:59] is in the cloud in the day of rain so
[1:33:01] was the appearance of the brightness
[1:33:03] round about this was the appearance look
[1:33:06] every bit of that he sums it up right
[1:33:09] here in one sentence this was the
[1:33:11] appearance of the likeness of the glory
[1:33:13] of the Lord and you were
[1:33:16] included every bit of that whole scene
[1:33:19] is that Holy Ghost working through you
[1:33:21] through the lion ox man and eagle let's
[1:33:24] stand to our feet I'll I'll start again
[1:33:26] next Sunday but man you got Revelations
[1:33:29] 4 that we saw that and then you got uh I
[1:33:31] want you to remember this I know most of
[1:33:33] you know this but if you look that word
[1:33:35] up living creature are the four Beast
[1:33:39] that is a zoon are a living being all
[1:33:42] right now if you go on a little bit
[1:33:45] further it talks about the beast in
[1:33:46] chapter Revelations 1113 to 17 that is
[1:33:50] interpretated as a theion beast or a
[1:33:52] wild untamable Beast which is going to
[1:33:56] be the beast in the end time so we'll
[1:33:59] get to that later we'll we'll we'll stop
