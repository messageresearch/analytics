TRANSCRIPT
========================================
shining in the light of your voice amen and amen and amen I want to see him don't you and it's fast getting to a close to be able to come to a time to see him because there's one thing about it every day is 24 hours closer so you know he's made his promises and we believe it don't we it's good to see everybody in the house of the Lord but to have a June's dad back there with his Gene and just for him to come and be with us and uh we're glad to have Brother Ray and sister Kathy back with us on Wednesday she's having to work on Wednesday for a while but things has changed so now they're get to be with us on Wednesday because we miss you when you're not here if you'd like turning your scriptures turn where we've been reading in Romans and then we will go to Romans 8. and then we'll go to Malachi 4. in Malachi Malachi 1 excuse me verse one and three and uh just remember the announcements as I reckon all of the announcements is over we're all except scheduling not this coming Wednesday but what is it the 30th which would be next Wednesday brother four needs to be with us and then a weekend or so later brother Quinn from Ireland is to be with us and then brother Danny Del munde from the Philippines will be with us so we've got to just schedule ahead when it comes around about last of July and the first of August and through there I just I'm just a scheduler so that's it works out pretty good letting all these brothers preach and I get to rest a while but we pray the Lord we're bless amen Romans 8 and Malachi 1. do you have any father we thank you tonight for an opportunity to be able to come together and thank you for your love and your grace unto us thank you for Calvary because without that Lord it wouldn't be any need of us being here but we pray that you'd just bless us and father give us understanding of you and reach down and touch us with your love and grace this night you said you'd be with us and you promised it in your word you said you'd you would heal the sick and deliver from destruction when your word went forth and we try our best to preach is what we can of the word so we believe you will be with us tonight and honor that word and just touch the sick among us and just have your way we love you and we thank you just let your grace be sufficient for all the needs that we have and we truly know that it will be we love you and we thank you in Jesus name amen Romans eight let's start with verse 28. and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are they called according to his purpose for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate than he also called and whom he called them he also justified in whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we then say to these things question right if God be for us who can be against us amen let's go over to Malachi and then read and then we're picking up her to talk tonight on this says the burden of the word of the Lord to I to Israel from Malachi I have loved you saith the Lord yet you say we're in had thou loved us now look at look at the point what would choosing of Jacob Esau Etc have to do with thinking about that you know you question God whether he loves you or not right so you might say well Lord I don't know where you love me or not you see because you say I have loved you saith the Lord if you say we're in house thou loved us was not Esau Jacob's brother saith the Lord yet I love Jacob and I hated Esau and laid his mountains in his Heritage ways for the dragons of the Wilderness you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word now more or less I've done a good bit of preaching there Sunday afternoon and I'll be doing a good bit of reading tonight but I want to get a point into our minds because I'm heading toward a thought that we will be dealing with for some time and I I just pray that you'll bear with me until I get over far enough to start you know considering the things but I want these things out of the way there are things you know that to me that are in the Bible that you know are a foundation and the Lord laying it down showing us and just like I was saying Darcy we would even question and say well now Lord how do we know you loved us you know he says well I called Jacob and I hated Esau he said well what's that got to do with loving well Jacob loved God he said what Esau did too yes but his was not in the correct manifestation so it wound up being in a different point so just think about that now we'll get back to it in a minute in the thought and carry it on but I asked a question and I'll be on this for a while using this as a title how does God predestinate all right now that's been a battle and an argument among organized religions you have what you call the calvinist and then you have the Armenians and they argue backwards and forth about this point of predestination one of them will say yes I believe it this way the others say well I don't believe that but I believe this all right but now what was the thought that we got down to on Sunday there how does God predestinate now if he predetermines something to take place you know like a person lost or something then that would make him a respecter of persons you know that wouldn't be a just God so we believe in a a just God who will you know he he will keep his word all right so then we talk about how will God predestinate how would he do it if he sat down and he picked one and left the other one out for any reason then he'd be a respecter of persons and that would be a very poor God to try to serve because you'd never know which way uh you know you would be in the argument among yourself as to finding out which side you're landing on you know which side is working and you know we don't want to do that which then that way you would try to uh say well if it's this side over here let me find out what that group of people done or are doing you know and I'll try to line up with that and then you say well no it's not that group it's it's this way well let me get in that group you know and find out how they uh how they're doing you know because I want to serve God don't you man I want to please him I want to honor him and I you know and all and and but I I just can't believe that in the words I believe our main point is that we don't see the real truth of predestination is the fact of whether or not we believe God is real and whether or not we believe how really is I'll keep making that emphasis unto us on this part or series as we go along how do you feel about God if God can't keep his word while serving you know I'm serious I'm not uh you know I'm 73 years old there's no need of trying to play games now you know but if God is not real then there's no need of coming to church and doing which is we're wasting our time you know we could eat drink and be merry cause them are we all died we just fell off with some glorified uh Monkey Tree as they call them Evolution and you know I don't believe it that way I believe that God is real and I don't believe that he sat down before the world and picked that one person and rejected the other one because I said you would be wanting to find out instead of trying to find God to save you do you understand what I'm getting at by my illustration that we all should want to know how to come to God for salvation right right and if it's this side over here you know if it's the Armenian doctrine of keeping on all of the ordinances and dates times and Seasons or whatever and trying to be legalistic about it then you know we want to do that because I want to be saved don't you all right well if it's the calvinist so I did just well it just don't make no difference I'm saved anyway well I want to put my whole heart and desire into that point of where I believe the Salvation is linked to and I believe I believe our Salvation is linked to the word that's right because how else could we hear or whatever we have need of you know which I believe we need to go into the word and study the word and from the study of the word then it will bring us the uh the understanding right oh salvation of what we're doing and and all like that so that's what I believe in it that we got down to the point of of reading where brother Branham was given the the thoughts on for knowledge and predestination but I want to make sure that we follow that in the right order all right we read it our Sunday and we tried to illustrate a little in our thoughts we'll read it again in a moment where the prophet of God says predestination looks back to foreknowledge amen he said for knowledge looks to Destiny well so that would mean then as I was trying to illustrate Sunday that the most important thing is the foreknowledge of God we've always been concerned about what was predetermined you know and if it was predetermined we'd we would fight and argue about whether we had a choice of you know or we're just predetermined is going to be what I'm going to be but when you start dealing with foreknowledge I know and realize that in dealing with foreknowledge that we're going to develop a thought in our mind that um well it's based upon what I do for knowledge and that's true but now we'll get down to it one of these days we're you know God already he sent word down to a man one time and didn't make his house in order Hezekiah you know he said you're going to die right that's right well he turned his head to the wall and began to pray and he begged God and God sent that same Prophet back that Prophet went down and told him thus saith the Lord you're going to die God sent the same Prophet back and said thus saith the Lord you're not going to die he said I'm going to give you 15 years well he did well we know the story it would have been better for Hezekiah to really die because he put Israel into a deep deep hole of sin with that 15 years but it's still the point is God for some reason he changed his mind he said well God don't change his mind well something happened because he told him he's going to die and then he told him he's going to live now see that way we think we understand foreknowledge foreign we'll get to that as a point as we try to go along but just remember God don't change his mind about his word all he done to Hezekiah was extended his life he died he died 15 years later so he didn't have to change his mind like we think but he did change his mind you know that life consists of a lot of things that we need to maybe sometimes change our minds about and praying you know pray for your kids pray for your wife your husband Etc that's not serving the lord you know it might be that God might change his mind right he said well you you sound like one time you're talking about an infinite God that can't never make another decision and then you'd look like he turned around said well look like he just changed his mind you know that's what I'm saying do we understand by God's foreknowledge he knew what he was going to do when he sent the prophet to Hezekiah he knew or else he's not God he knew he was going to extend his life well did he change his mind as much as we think if Hezekiah went into the bad things that we're going to have to deal with a little something and we'll get back to it Sunday but I'm just laying this down then we'll back up what do you think about permissive will and perfect will permissive will is not perfect will right no because it won't work but yet God can take permissive will and make it work out for his perfect will so really do we understand I say this because you know the reason I I lay things out like that sometimes and just lay it out a little bit and then back away is because that we get Soul set in our mind that we we say I know what that is it's just for knowledge you know it's just God's foreknowledge well it's not just God's foreknowledge sure he knows what he's going to do but how can he judge us if he makes us do it amen you can't my brother says he can't judge me for being a sinner because he made me a sinner I said no he didn't make us sinner I said he made you on a free moral agency just like anyone else and you accepted the fact of of being a sinner he made you with a choice so you don't blame God for it but that I say those things and you see I know that sometimes I watch and sometimes you reactions and I don't need the reactions a lot of times to know thoughts of human beings but I'm trying to get us to not just lock down on one thing because when we do we're just like the Armenians are the the calvinist we take our thoughts and ideas and we put a period you know we say it can't be any other way is that right he said what you know I know righteous together make you think you go home and think about what I'm saying because if you're not careful you'll get on the four knowledge points so much until you'll just run your router for knowledge and you'll say well God thought I was going to be sick so I'm sick right and then we'll run on that route with it well maybe he wants me to stay sick right see sometimes he wants us change our minds amen amen more than changing his that's what I'm saying see we could just we just get on a point and we just well that's it when you get into God and dealing with his ways and doings you know we don't want to drive down a stake somewhere and just try to stop on something remember that's organized religion they say we believe this made you stop you and I can do the same thing so don't don't just think about four knowledge is you know it's totally what God for knew and that's true he did that's where the truth is so hard to preach he said hard to preach the truth yeah because the way man's mind has been taught he said would I've never been taught nothing about predestination you sit and listen to Mom and Daddy talk sometime in the floor and that held with you well I guess that was predetermined to happen so it's got to happen well let me give you a scripture let's see if we can deal with foreknowledge and and deal with what I'm trying to say by scripture the Bible says it's appointed unto man wants to die is that Bible well we're all gonna die is that the way we think about it if it is we're all gonna die so see you can drive your your point of foreknowledge to to where it just I've been thinking on this all day today and I thought in my mind and I wrote a few notes down but I see we can just deal with with the four knowledge point until we can we run to the ground because it's appointed and the man wants to die you know somebody has got to come to a place right that they can search the scriptures enough to find something in the scriptures that will not destroy that scripture but we'll magnify it or you know Jesus never come to destroy the law under the scriptures or anything he came to magnify the law he said you said of old Thou shalt not commit adultery he said but I say unto thee if you look on a woman or lust actor in your heart said you committed a daughter already he magnified it all right see then you take the scripture there where it says it's appointed unto man wants to die you know that actually Jesus Christ by his death to take my place he broke that scripture he didn't annihilate it because people are still dying but he took my place see then that scripture can't apply to me right right somebody's gonna have to say that one of these days because the Bible says you're Chained and won't drink with an eye see we look at it as everybody's going to die no everybody's not going to die Enoch didn't die Elijah didn't die right well see my point that I'm trying to get you we when I lay hat I will and I'll lay heavily on for knowledge but just don't run your foreknowledge so far back until you can't keep a level ahead in the rest of the scripture because when you do you're gonna you'll be out on the on the end of the limb you know so think about it for knowledge is a wonderful thing it is actually a knowledge Webster says of something before that's why it's called for knowledge all right the Bible says those who he foreknew he did predestinate all right then coming down to where we're at and looking at it he's taking what he said to us that predestination it looks back to foreknowledge all right but then when you come back to foreknowledge you can see the destiny it laid out in front of you and see to me now this is this is my thought so just forgive me this to bring your thoughts Connor I don't want to just preach free destination for not only just read a bunch of quotes right for me to think about for knowledge as being that God foreknew all things then he could according to Revelation 13 8 he could write all the names in the land Book of Life for the foundation world and it could be that's the scripture says that Jesus Christ stood as a lamb slain before the foundation of the world but that took place two thousand years ago this Christ being crucified you see then foreknowledge it means that God in his mind before the world ever begun before there was anything a world or anything we know that the Bible calls him or the words used in it speaks of Elohim which means self-existing that's the best words they can use for it existed alone but he wasn't alone he had his thoughts now don't you think that he knew that we would fall if he created us as was bringing out Sunday if he didn't he's not God that's my whole point does God know everything if he doesn't he's not God he's one of the Gods we certainly don't want to go that way do we we're not dealing with just some thought of a of a God you know or some idea then it puts foreknowledge to me as one of the greatest things that could ever be thought of foreknowledge is the greatest thought it could ever be in any way because he knew I would want to be saved he knew that by his foreknowledge no I don't know we preached it I can go all the way back and we will but I want you to think about foreknowledge and you know what that gives you a connection that maybe you'd never thought of because then it's not a stamped thing of predetermining it God would not desire for anybody to be lost he wanted everybody saved right and then to think about it for knowledge that you've got a part of it I wasn't going to go this way tonight but I will for a second then back up and go back on it Sunday you got a part to do with it right he saw your desire he saw what you wanted my brother down I definitely didn't want it I was out there in the world of sin you know but something happened didn't it something changed you didn't we want to try to be some kind of a great big super duper uh seed we want to try to make it something some great big thing that's within us when the prophet of God said every person in the world was born because of a Creator creating us whether it be hot and taught that's never heard of Jesus Christ Yeti worships alligators he worships his son he worship animals he worship why why does he do that because he's a creation and he knows as a creator and he longs to try to find that creator or in some way satisfy him so they'll feed their babies and alligators right to try to get along with their God but I want you to think just get that in your mind and then I'll get off of it foreknowledge is the greatest thing that you could ever think of God doesn't choose by who's good and who's not good if he did he goofed up right Moses what about Paul killing all the Christians putting them to death signing this signature to no telling how many of that they killed and yet God saved him don't you ever think about yourself why did God save you you don't ever think that way you don't ever even consider it do you think it's some great big something some thing you've done or didn't do or you have four knowledge goes all the way back into God's mind any four new all kinds then he could set in motion on the Earth things to make it come to his perfect will it was not God's perfect will to bring you an eye on the earth in the conditioned existence that we are you know what he's going to change these bodies to make his perfect will come into being yet he will take his permission will and bless and honor until he comes to a time that we can be made eternal permissive will if there hadn't been a permissive will I'm giving you some things to think on if there hadn't been a permissive will how would he have ever displayed his attributes what about a permissive will to bring God's attributes into being sounds like a perfect wheel don't it but it's only permissive see we want to make ourselves to be some kind of a great son instead of Simply thinking about your life you don't ever sit down sometimes and just Ponder you know just think about your life you think about what you were doing and then something happened to turn you around something just changed things you can't explain it can you don't need any trying see that's the foreknowledge of God now all right now when we get down into minutes you'll see more of what I'm talking about so let's go ahead and do a little reading because I want to stay on this until we see it amen but look what the prophet of God said look at number four go ahead these are the Sunday Sunday Services notes I just got so far look what he said on the message called the power of God in 1955 1006 the evening sir the word predestinate that's not a good word to use the word foreknowledge is better see because there's so many doctrines of predestination I'll read you one to many where he says there's a Doctrine predestination it's just it's garbage and see most people's ideas yours and mine upon predestination we're garbage cans sorry well we had it right you couldn't explain Hezekiah oh you didn't have it right he was only in permissive but look what he says predestination looks back to foreknowledge and foreknowledge looks to the destination all right so which one's first did God sit down draw out a road map make pictures do whatever this is the way it's going to be that would be predetermining well what about an infinite God that knew what everything was going to be then he doesn't have to predetermine does he now there are things in God that he does we will eventually get to it you realize the fivefold ministry faithful Ministry is a predestinated Eternal gift from God that's what your Prophet says unless if you believe it when we get there what do you understand God not making said it in order a little hole that you have to go through and can't go no other way it can't be it can't be a hole he just puts you in and makes you go through it gives you a choice you had a choice whether to come to church or not or not probably long about now you're wondering what in the world I'm preaching I probably said well I wish I just stayed home hey we want to make it something see like he's saying there we want to make it something that that predestination is just a hole and he puts you in that hole and makes you go then we'll back up and say uh no that's not right he foreknew he forward knew he's going to put you in a hole and push you through it now you're in the same shape are you listening you're in the same shape as in you got put in the hole push through it God don't do his works like that that's why I love him he's working on your desire he'll give you just exactly the amount you desire but you certainly don't believe in predestination for knowledge first and I believe then that he predestinates our sets of Destiny that this world is going to last so long that it's going to do this there was a predestination of this is going to happen uh that's going to happen but he knew it would happen see we don't want to pray because we might be praying against the will of God you'll never come up with that idea have you no Baptist Church way back they had a Doctrine they believed that they didn't want to have no Revival you know why because they afraid you they wouldn't take your kids to their kids to a Revival because they're afraid they might get saved it wouldn't be God's will uh come on may we quote in the message people said one time he said I'd like for me and my wife to have another child but said I'm afraid it might not be a predestinated seed okay what's your thoughts what's your thoughts look but God's not making it said and said it in order a little hole that you have to go through and can't go no other way but God in order to be God he knowed the end from the beginning so he could predict and set things in order to happen true but he's working according to your desires because he desired it everybody to be saved okay what about the next one where I think Pentecost fail 1955-11-11 and the word here is used in the fifth verse of predestination predestinated it's not a very good word reason he's saying it's not a good word is because of what I said you know you'll hear it over and over and over and it's not a good word it doesn't mean it's not a right word or right predestination is right it's just that mankind and their ideas when you say predestination he's a presbyterian right because that was the Presbyterian Doctrine all right he's a Baptist that was a Baptist doctor the Baptist Church was split by Two Brothers over predestination see so you said predestin well he's he's Presbyterian you see that it's not a good word to use well because it gives you the wrong thought because your mind is trained of what that word predestination means I hope one of these days to be able to preach enough about it until God's predestination will so Captivate you and I until we'll see his foreknowledge you see that sounds silly sure does that's the way I think I don't want us to get worthy we just X Out predestination says all for knowledge I want us to be able to use these words but yet not be confused do you follow me supercars kind of confuses people when you say free that's tonight predestination speaks looks back to foreknowledge foreknowledge looks to destination predestination goes back to the foreknowledge foreknowledge goes to the destiny it's all right for knowledge is the greatest understanding of all right we've tried to figure out predestination why not try to figure out foreknowledge well it just simply means god look down through well why didn't he just go on vacation until the world got through and leave us alone and let us just do whatever we're going to do when I first heard that Prophet make that statement one day I was shouting about it he said even though God had done what he done and provided a lamb and Etc he said he didn't step in heaven he said he come down here to live through life with you and I that's right if it's all preterm determined set why did he need to come see I want to drive it down until we'll see predestination is a good word because it's in God's word he's explaining for knowledge he's explained it's going to explain predestination goes back to full knowledge before knowledge goes to Destiny see we want to come over here we're to predestinating that oh I could just see that predestinated seat I just believe you know like I said Napoleon stick his hand in he I think I was here before that's what Napoleon thought well I think I'm a seed You Think You Are you don't know what you are look he's explaining it in other words God didn't say now I'll make this man be this and I'll make this man be that he didn't do it but in order to be God he had to know the end from the beginning amen so in order to for knowledge that he knew he could say this would happen and that would happen because he was God and knowed where everything would be placed what and therefore he could ordain certain things for certain ages you believe that that's the scriptures he said certain things for certain ages that's where I ended Sunday now think about these things let's read one more number six Junction of time 1956. 122. did you ever read over in Romans 9 and we're going to get that in just a second how did he said before either boy was born Esau and Jacob said I hate one and love the other how can he be just and do that what he said how can he be just and love Jacob and Haiti saw how did he say it is by foreknowledge he knew what a rascal he saw was seeing he could predestinate not just say say that the word predestinate is not a good word to use it's foreknowledge because he wouldn't just be deliberately turn you away now here's the one we got to Sunday because it's because you have he wants you to go away now the prophet's not saying he wants you to go away pull that part out right because stop your sentence here because it's not that he wants you to go away God don't want you to go away right read it over and over and over to you get the point he's not wanting you to go away he's wanting you to be saved and he wouldn't do it that way he's not willing that any of you should perish but before knowledge he knows what he will do even before you ever come on to Earth sure for knowledge he's infinite he's God he's omnipotent I'm the president omniscient and he knows all things all wisdom and all time covered all his face and all power he's infinite and if he isn't that he's not God if he is an almighty God if he can't do all things he's not almighty God but if he's almighty God he can do all things see so that's the way we have to believe him we got to believe that he didn't make no mistakes right that he can't make a mistake we've got to believe that or else we wind up wondering what he's doing he didn't want nobody to be lost he wants everybody to be saved but no no who will be saved and who won't now you're you put your God in a peanut brain situation like you and I are in see he can't never have a new thought you and I do all the time and he can't do it look what he's saying now he said go to Romans 9. let's pull that up and just read it Romans 9. or 6 through 13. not as though the word of God hath taken none effect but they are not always Israel which are of Israel neither because they are the Seed of Abraham are they all children but in Isaac shall thy seed be called this is they which are the children of the flesh these are not the children of God the children of flesh is not the children of God come on but the children of the promised are counted for the seed yeah I hope you catching them now you ought to see where we're going we're going down eventually you get to talk about that seed listen for This Is The Word of Promise at this time will I come and say Rose shall have a son now that's dealing real good in the line of Sarah and Isaac and Isaac be in the seed of promise and right Paul coming down explaining it now look what he says but not only this but when Rebecca had conceived by one even by Our Father Isaac for the children being not yet born neither haven't done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth it was said unto her the Elder Shall Serve the younger as it is written Jacob have I loved but he saw how I hated now what has that to do with the text that Paul is in he's just got to explaining though that are not those that are of the flesh are not the children of the promise that's what he's explaining Jacob and Esau both was lost both of them needed a sacrifice the flesh is not involved right it's a promise see that away Jacob and Esau could have the same mom and daddy and yet God loved Jacob in 80s are it's not a seat of the pr of the law the seat of the prime of that it's the seed of promise we're going to get to that point when you get back to that scripture but you'll see what I'm talking about look at number seven which is uh God's covenant with Abraham in his seat 56-23 . now Jesus didn't come to Calvary just for a haphazard thought what well I'll die up there and perhaps maybe somebody will feel sorry for me and come down and get saved he said no no God don't run his office like that you don't run your office like that now if it's a hole that you put in and pushed through that would be your haphazard thought come on Jesus never come to Calvary to make you go any certain way he come at Calvary to die for everyone amen now if you don't believe it that way you're going to predetermined totally so just go on with your Doctrine Jesus never come to save this certain people he comes to save everybody he paid the price for everybody he said well he knew who would be saved and who wouldn't it's all right now you're going back to foreknowledge because you done got off your haphazard dog you've lost it in predestination well God before the world he just saw certain people be saved and he come down to die for that that's no more than what he says there that you think maybe that you come down on the cross and he said and that's my brother he's a Methodist preacher this is what he says about it he said told me one day he said I think everything in the is just kind of haphazard in life but said there are certain things that are predetermined but said I don't think one of them is Jesus died on the cross and I said what do you mean he said well what he done he just come down to die hoping somebody feel sorry for him get saved I didn't know that was what that man come on down later and I know he didn't hear it but he said he he just died for this you know this morning to anybody now there's your Crossing you for knowledge in your predestination he didn't come down to do that he come to seek and save those that was lost which was everybody when you make salvation only for a certain seed or group of people you've done gone into predetermine You've Lost Your foreknowledge but if you leave it to the point of where that he knows what you're going to do before you ever do it that's no problem why would he hate Jacob and love Esau that's no problem let's read he'll run it off it's like that Jesus come for one specific purpose that was to redeem those that God foreknew would be redeemed he said what you just said he come to die for everybody that's right and that's what he's saying come on everybody's got to have the opportunity to be saved but yet by knowing who would be saved and who wouldn't he knows who he come to die for salvation is for everybody but everybody won't have it right so it's not for everybody then right because it won't have it God's not willing that any should perish but it all would come to repentance but in order to be God he had to know now the word predestinate is used in Ephesians 1 5 predestinate there isn't a good word it means in in speaking of three destinations people sometimes lead them to think that God just predestinated you to push you through a little pipe same quote as well ago right or something that's not right predestination looks back to foreknowledge and foreknowledge looks to Destiny therefore God being God before the foundation of the world knew that who would be saved and who would not Romans 8. he could say that he hated which is Romans 9. Esau and loved Jacob before either child was born four by four knowledge he knowed what a little shyster that he saw would be and how he would save Jacob so therefore by foreknowledge God knew those things see for knowledge so then look now and I'm basing something I wish we had more time about his subject he's basing it on the facts of foreknowledge and God knew and didn't say that there will be he said there'd be a church God knew there'd be a church but let me get just a thought see we want to put everything on the we used to put everything on the predestinate huh then we learned of the foreknowledge of existing before the predestination and then now we want to put everything under the foreknowledge that's fine because before new all things hold a Pony for new all time but now as I said while ago he foreknew Hezekiah would want 15 years so he gave it to him yet he had already told him he was going to die so it never changed his mind about him dying but he knew what would happen what about your foreknowledge see he knew Jacob would be a little shyster and like I said the other day we want to take Jacob and Esau and make some form of a salvational point out of it but just remember that's only type in your salvation did you understand that Sunday because Jacob and Esau is not talking about salvation Jacob and Esau was talking about a Birthright which is the top of the baptism of the Holy Ghost but Jacob he wasn't dealing with trying to get stuff away from Esau to go to heaven did you understand me Sunday I mean I don't know where you'd ever thought on that line Jacob and Esau is not talking about salvation he's talking about natural properties Jacob wanted the birthright which meant a double portion the birthright was supposed to go to the oldest when it already said the younger would you know the older would serve the younger so there was nothing that could be done back there in it but Jacob and Esau not talking about Heavenly matters Jacob and Esau talking about natural things it wasn't that Jacob loved God and Esau hated God I wonder what it was it's over a Birthright Esau sold it out for a Mr meal cause he was starving to death he's hungry see that touch you and I and I that's a type of salvation to where you and I want the birthright the new birth he saw was was one it was just it didn't matter he's like a worldly person today that it don't matter you know but Jacob wanted that natural Birthright get your story straight and in the 50 picture Esau then he didn't care he didn't care about all this other he just wanted something to eat all right but see that's a type of you Desiring the New Birth when other people's not Desiring it all right so what's God looking at oh shyster that's what Jacob was you mean God likes a shyster better than he likes a good person come on we're going back to the foreknowledge Jacob what what but a steer he stole that by Birthright come on get your natural story ride wouldn't that be something brother dick come to me and starving to death I'd send him say okay give me 20 bucks I'll feed you a meal I said yeah but I'm starving to death I'm famished give me 20 bucks I sure ain't Christianity that's a natural story all right but with a spiritual application to come in that you and I but would you today would you deny somebody's salvation that would want to come to you and talk to you about the Lord well I'm I'm predestinated seat I don't need fool around the rest y'all guys you tell me that ain't the message right now I'll tell you you need to get some tapes and start listening to it oh my god listen Jacob was a natural story that typed your new birth Esau was a natural human being see that's why you can't go in the Bible and take things out of it just any way you want to now what about Jacob being the dirty Rascal he was that wouldn't give his brother his meal and stole his Birthright come on but have you ever read the rest of the story Jacob's names came to Israel but he's on his way back home he's scared to death and he saw because he figured he's going to kill him right right by every right he saw header out to kill him he was a shyster but when he got back there we saw this one of them right crafty Hallelujah grabbed him and started hugging him he said it's actually a family is that your family and check if he's trying to give him everything he saw says I don't need none of your stuff I got plenty come on you don't have to read all the story we talk about how that Sarah and the you know found the Water of Life but we don't ever talk about Hagar when she was laying on without crying out for that baby and God came down and spoke to Hagar and said tires the water get it and you're in the child to live so that was where natural things to type yeah we talk about foreknowledge could we be using that as this what I'm talking about not going all the way back to see what would cause the four dollies to happen see I'm not through with the message I'm just getting started something triggered that for knowledge what was it something caused me to think it's the only one he just thought about what he was going to do that's a good point to hold you for a while because I said let's get into the story of the Bible let's get into the things of God let's don't stamp this thing and make it one way let's think about the choices we've made read around and said how could that predestinated seed and he said it did end up then that rehab to harlot she was a predestinated seat but see we got it all figured out so we've left our predestination to determined in factor and thoughts and now we're on for knowledge with amen we're on a good place to start I said start we're in a good place to start thinking about ourselves and thinking about the choices we made in life and the things that caused us to come to this message of the hour and you hear the word of God the Bible said it sacrifice and offerings I would as not you know the Bible says God's nostrils he said my nostrils are stinking with all your sacrifices and offerings but he said an honest and a contrite heart is what I desire do we make mistakes we just been through all of that the Christians fall in sin yes we sin every day but our sin is not the word unbelief you've got to break that down if you don't you've done isolated yourself out and stamped your Doctrine with a period and you can't understand but before knowledge you can look back and you can see you can see why David could be a man after God's Own Heart yet he'd have a man killed to get his wife see we'll get down one of these days to understand what God is dealing with and why would he hate Esau because he knew Esau wouldn't make no difference we sing that song wait a little longer please Jesus until we get our families in I want to see my family serving God yes I've claimed every one of them and they'll come I believe it because I'll be there with my Offspring I've claimed those scriptures and I'll believe them but you know what that makes that makes a hard Road for them like I used to tell June when Wade was backslid I said every time I look at him I said I laugh and I didn't mean I'll laugh at him and making fun of him I had no thoughts for that I said I lied I said because I know what he's going to go through you say go through bad things in your life about it yeah because God was going to get his attention here's your predestination there's your full knowledge if you can believe can I quote the prophet he said if you don't have enough ability to believe for your family he says I doubt you're believing for yourself is that what he said yeah but I just don't see brother Dale how things can be changed why did you stamp them you stepped them predestinated you stopped your families predetermined when you said that no hope that's what I know I got in trouble about the marriage and divorce I got into trouble about everything but I stay in it I want and don't worry about it I say God is there for you if you can accept him don't worry about what you've done and didn't do right right at least be a Jacob and have a desire for the birthright desire for God to come and live in your heart but brother Dale I've prayed for my families and they just ain't come you're gonna quit poor little guy you want somebody to pet you keep praying keep crying out before God until they come and then when you see them come you'll realize can I say it this way you'll realize that you had something to do with your family coming now stamp that with a predetermined or just roll it over to foreignology either way you want to God knew whether or not she was going to pray for your children as I said while ago there's no such thing as wait a longer until people get saved no there ain't going to be one person there that's not saved for knowledge a knowledge beforehand now I'm going to end it with doing it this way then did God before the world sit down and think this thing out in his foreknowledge or are we living God's part are we living it are we in the foreknowledge of God is this what it is well if you don't say sit back before the world saw it but okay go ahead this still is what it is all things are possible what to God yes that's not what the Bible says that all things are possible to them that believe come on folks you believe enough to get yourself saved why can't you believe for your family foreign at me because my kids ain't here okay I'm throwing it to you because your kids ain't here that solved the problem is that what you want me to say where you can can be doubting it or trying to believe what I'm talking about amen trying to believe the god that I'm talking to you about amen that can do all things see we want to go back in it we want to go over there we want to go over here why not just live our lives like we know where we are right now say Lord help me because my your four knowledge Lord you know tomorrow I'm going to make mistakes oh you don't never talk like that I'm not planning on doing it right I I just know we are okay not planning to do it just know we will guarding his foreknowledge knowed exactly what we think tonight I hope so he knew what we'd think that's foreknowledge think on these things come on brothers take on these things I'm a firm believer to make sure you don't leave you and you think well brother Dale I don't know what you're talking about I'm a firm believer in God before the world ever begun could look down through time and see every spec second have you ever heard this in the prophet he said he never gnat and every time that nap would bat its eye and how much tower that and that would make I never didn't know that's made Tyler but evidently do because he said they did but yet I don't look at it then it's tomorrow that something happens I said well that was just God God knew that's going to happen now I wonder what he knows gonna happen next you're going to scare yourself to death I walked day by day saying Lord there is no future to me and I don't want my past I just want to live day by day I just want to be what I am today I told my wife the other day I just kind of a little cranky I guess whether or not I just apologize you know what I said she didn't even understand it she told me she didn't I said honey forgive me for being what I am she said forgive me for being what you are no need to try and explain it I just left the room but listen church I believe in an eternal God I believe in his eternal wisdom that he could look down through time and he could see today having to be here in the church but I know he could be looking at your desires right now he's looking at the desires we have right now I've always told you a secret many many years ago I told you a secret way to do things how many remembers this story I said when you're set and listening to some preacher he's brought down the presence of God to you and he begins to explain God to you and talking and this is about the time he revealed something to you I said just raise your hand and say my family you'll find out one of these days that's no garbage can that's a way of knowing something you start receiving from God just raise your hands and say my family my husband my wife my children my mother my daddy my just called her name right well let's do it he wasn't bothering me if you everyone started hollering out loud but I believe you caught on to what I'm talking about I'm not back there before the world and I'm not over under I'm here you know God's not over there and God's not back there God is here with you and I because he said I'll be with you always no he didn't say always we want to translate that don't we it is always looking up and he said I'll wait always would mean he would be there all the time no matter what she'd done he'd be he's not going to do it because sometimes he's going to take his blindfold away from us but he's going to be there all way all the way through the Journey he's going to be with me and take care of me that's the kind of God I believe let's stand what we got Brothers for knowledge before come on here to hire higher bro until someday the last step
