[14:50] you we commit it to you now in Jesus
[14:52] name
[14:54] all right Matthew 5.
[14:57] it will be up on the board there if you
[14:59] want to read it
[15:01] verse 37-48 then we'll go to John
[15:05] 6 verse 60.
[15:09] but let your communication be yay yay
[15:11] nay nay for whatsoever is more than
[15:15] these cometh of evil
[15:17] you have heard that it has been said an
[15:19] eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth
[15:21] but I say unto you that you resist not
[15:24] evil
[15:26] but whosoever shall smite thee on thy
[15:29] right she turn to him the other also
[15:33] and if any man will sue thee at the law
[15:36] and take away thy coat let him have thy
[15:39] cloak also and whosoever shall compel
[15:42] thee to go on my own remember this is
[15:44] right after the Beatitudes you know
[15:46] Beatitudes blessed is he the blessed is
[15:49] he blessed is he now the Lord is showing
[15:51] you what the Beatitudes turn into living
[15:55] in our lives right you remember that
[15:57] right
[16:07] you have heard that it has been said I
[16:10] shall love thy neighbor and hate thine
[16:12] enemy but I say unto you
[16:15] here's the attitudes in action now
[16:18] love your enemies bless them that curse
[16:20] you and do good do good to them that
[16:23] hate you and pray for them which
[16:25] despitefully use you and persecute you
[16:28] that you may be the children of your
[16:30] father which is in heaven pretty maketh
[16:32] his son to rise on the evil and on the
[16:34] good and send us Reign on the just and
[16:36] the unjust
[16:37] for if you love them which love you what
[16:40] reward have you do not even Republicans
[16:43] the same and if you salute your brethren
[16:46] only what do you more than others do not
[16:49] even the publicans show and watch as he
[16:52] sums it up
[16:55] be therefore perfect even as your father
[16:58] which is in heaven is perfect all right
[17:01] let's go over to John
[17:03] we read that every scripture because
[17:04] we're in a study on
[17:06] um
[17:07] be therefore perfect this is message
[17:10] number three so then we take a title
[17:12] from that and then we go forth with John
[17:15] 6 16.
[17:18] many therefore his disciples when they
[17:21] heard this said this isn't hard saying
[17:24] who can hear it
[17:26] when Jesus knew in himself the Disciples
[17:28] of murmured at it he said unto them does
[17:30] this offends you you know you got to eat
[17:32] this you eat nothing you eat you know
[17:34] the father and the when Jesus knew it
[17:38] himself the disciples murmured it he
[17:40] said unto them does this offends you
[17:42] what and if you shall see the son of man
[17:45] Ascend up where he was
[17:48] before amen it is the spirit that quick
[17:51] enough the flesh prophets of nothing the
[17:53] words I speak unto thee once they were
[17:56] spiriting their life
[17:57] but there are some of you that believe
[18:01] not or Jesus knew from the beginning who
[18:04] they were that believe not and who
[18:06] should
[18:07] betray him and he said therefore said I
[18:11] unto you that no man can come unto me
[18:14] except it was we're given unto
[18:17] him of my father
[18:19] from that time many of the disciples
[18:21] went back and walked not no more with
[18:23] him
[18:25] then said Jesus unto the 12.
[18:28] will you also go away little word you
[18:31] want to go to right amen
[18:35] what was the answer then Simon Peter
[18:37] answered
[18:38] in Lord to whom shall we go
[18:42] thou Hast the words
[18:45] of eternal life so you can be seated
[18:48] will stop right there he goes on to say
[18:50] that thou art the Christ
[18:52] the son of the Living God now
[18:55] as I said we've been in a
[18:57] in a series and I gently preach
[19:01] anywhere from
[19:03] 20 to 50 sermons when I get in a series
[19:07] I used to sign scripture as a thought
[19:09] but then continue on in what I'm wanting
[19:13] you to see because
[19:15] you know
[19:16] as we've said before many times
[19:20] they've argued about that Matthew 5 48.
[19:24] where it says be therefore perfect even
[19:26] as your father in Heaven is perfect
[19:29] and you know the denominations
[19:32] people have argued that and then you
[19:35] hear it even among the uh messaged
[19:38] people to argue about what that means
[19:41] and they try to define words and that's
[19:45] fine it's all right because it says
[19:48] there that
[19:49] um Scofield even gives it that
[19:52] um it's not the fact of talking about
[19:55] sin that Jesus was talking about he was
[19:58] talking about growth development do we
[20:00] know that that goes with it but you know
[20:03] we we still have to uh keep it in the
[20:07] correct line because we just say well
[20:09] this is the definition well the
[20:11] definition of a wording can be fine
[20:13] because you remember that we used our in
[20:16] in Genesis 6 and 9 where it says Noah
[20:20] was perfect
[20:21] all right in his generation job one and
[20:25] one job one and eight and job two and
[20:27] three all says that job was perfect
[20:30] right all right and then Genesis 17 it
[20:34] says for Abraham was told to walk before
[20:36] God would be perfect all right then in
[20:40] Psalms 37 and 37 I think this is Mark
[20:43] the perfect man right
[20:45] all right
[20:47] but then we found out that
[20:51] were the the word in Genesis 6 and 9
[20:54] that says to for that Noah was perfect
[20:58] it means completeness sound etc etc it's
[21:01] not talking about Sin and sinlessness
[21:04] right it's more talking of a stature a
[21:09] point
[21:09] but we also found that that was the
[21:11] number 8549 and you strong but we found
[21:15] that in Ezekiel 28 where it's talking
[21:17] about Satan right he said he was perfect
[21:21] when he was created and he was sure
[21:23] because God can't create any create
[21:25] anything imperfect that's right so he
[21:27] was perfect in his creation right but
[21:30] then he went forth you know and went on
[21:32] but it's the same definition amen do
[21:35] people want to argue about what this
[21:36] means and what that means instead of
[21:39] taking the whole things and a lot of
[21:41] people they believe that Noah was the
[21:43] only righteous seed which many was the
[21:46] only seed of God and everything else was
[21:48] serpent seed and that's in the message
[21:50] now and it you know he so that would
[21:53] have ended at the flood and that would
[21:54] have been a problem but I like the way
[21:57] it wrote around says he said will you
[21:58] say that the curse was Blackness to put
[22:01] up on cage that ended at the flood
[22:04] well if there was only one righteous
[22:06] seed left
[22:07] and Noah was the only one then
[22:09] everything out of there is messed up you
[22:11] know and so that solves the problem but
[22:14] that don't solve it to people that don't
[22:16] want to hear it that's right because
[22:17] they're not going to do it it's just
[22:18] like everybody else will say you know
[22:20] you say well the Bible said be perfect
[22:22] you think be perfect amen
[22:27] well
[22:29] now if the Bible says I am right
[22:34] then your argument is not with me right
[22:36] that's right your argument is with God
[22:39] amen amen because he was the one that
[22:42] said it and that's what I've been trying
[22:43] to get across a couple of messages that
[22:45] even in the Old Testament then we
[22:47] haven't got to the New Testament we're
[22:48] bordering on it today
[22:50] of coming in you know and you know in
[22:53] just a minute and you'll see what we're
[22:55] getting to to border on between the old
[22:58] and the New Testament then this
[22:59] afternoon we'll come on over into the
[23:01] New Testament with it
[23:03] that in the Old Testament
[23:06] no it was perfect right
[23:08] well I really don't now you just talked
[23:11] to God right
[23:13] I'm gonna argue with you right you just
[23:16] talked to him I'm like this would just
[23:18] we're preaching all right
[23:20] you say well it says job he was perfect
[23:23] God said it three times that's right now
[23:25] anytime according to the prophet anytime
[23:27] God repeats himself there's a total
[23:31] repeat of the uh first chapter in in
[23:35] there and uh two and
[23:38] um first and eight I believe or
[23:39] somewhere in there and two and three
[23:40] it's just identical repeat all right and
[23:43] if God repeats itself the prophet said
[23:45] listen
[23:47] you know listen because he's saying
[23:50] something right Amen in other words he's
[23:52] stamping it with a a point of saying
[23:55] listen to this right
[23:57] you know verily burning oh yeah amen I
[24:01] say unto you yeah that means it's a
[24:03] double statement of listen amen because
[24:06] it means something all right now that's
[24:08] the way I look at it because that's what
[24:09] I followed the Bible
[24:10] all right
[24:12] but then we say well it's impossible to
[24:15] be perfect
[24:17] I agree 100 that's right amen it is
[24:21] impossible for any mortal human being
[24:24] do you ever think about being perfect
[24:26] right amen
[24:28] now this is going to stumble you because
[24:30] we're going to go over to it eventually
[24:32] even under the New Testament blood of
[24:35] Jesus Christ it's impossible for a human
[24:37] mortal being to be perfect right man
[24:39] within themselves
[24:41] are you with me amen yes but brother
[24:45] then we're perfect in the New Testament
[24:46] but wasn't perfect in the old show me
[24:48] the Bible I just gave you scripture that
[24:52] it says they were perfect that's just a
[24:53] few you know scriptures to show you that
[24:57] God looked down and when he said for
[25:00] Noah to make that atonement right amen
[25:03] he made it right
[25:05] his arguing Brothers came you know three
[25:08] of them when they first with him chapter
[25:10] after chapter that he'd secretly sinned
[25:13] he said I haven't done it amen he said
[25:16] sure I'm a human being
[25:18] I'm a moral
[25:20] but said show me what I've done wrong
[25:23] amen and they couldn't do it all right
[25:26] fine because he was under the atonement
[25:29] right even maybe atonement of those
[25:31] expression the other day for his
[25:32] children and God saved them right amen
[25:35] all right that's right now that's how
[25:37] much the atonement was made
[25:39] all right see then when we come to look
[25:43] at it
[25:45] what made him perfect
[25:48] the atonement right
[25:50] red through red you see why
[25:55] God couldn't see him because he made you
[25:58] oh man when they made that atonement for
[26:02] sin they settlement right now here's
[26:05] where we go to and I said I've seen tags
[26:07] it said said I'm not perfect I'm just
[26:09] just I'm just forgiving well now if
[26:11] you're forgiven
[26:12] if God forgives you right how can he
[26:16] ever bring it up again right you see the
[26:19] corner of Mind wants to make beautiful
[26:21] statements that people looked at that
[26:23] you know and probably
[26:25] um no 99 of the people have looked at
[26:28] that tag thought well that's right
[26:31] I'm not perfect I'm just forgive but
[26:35] when I looked at it I said Thank God I'm
[26:37] forgiving that makes me perfect right
[26:38] amen hallelujah amen brother to Hell
[26:42] mate that make you no God said I was
[26:45] that's right you argue with him I'm not
[26:47] trying to express nothing but the Bible
[26:49] right and the prophet's message to what
[26:52] he said all right so I gave you some
[26:54] quotes let's just pull these up going
[26:55] and start reading on them but brother
[26:58] random says it
[27:00] these were perfect so you can't argue
[27:02] with him
[27:04] somehow you can you I know this ain't
[27:06] gonna convert nobody I've always said
[27:08] that well you ain't gonna convert nobody
[27:10] don't want to be converted right you
[27:12] ain't gonna change nobody's mind it
[27:14] don't want to be changed that's right
[27:15] you could spend six months sitting there
[27:17] with them pounding them to death about
[27:19] it that the Bible says the prophet said
[27:20] they come out and say but why did you
[27:23] saying amen yeah we're not perfect oh we
[27:28] might be forgiven
[27:30] well
[27:31] I thought the Bible said no more that
[27:34] our sin was in the seal forgetfulness
[27:39] to Never Be Remembered anymore I I
[27:42] thought that's what the Bible said Amen
[27:44] brother Dan what are you trying to get
[27:46] to us one thing
[27:50] we've got to believe what God says
[27:54] what do you mean we've been in the
[27:56] message 40 years and you're still trying
[27:57] to tell us that yeah amen we're around
[28:00] here 40 more I'll still be trying to
[28:01] tell you that all right amen amen
[28:04] because that's what we're not doing
[28:06] we're not believing What God Says About
[28:08] Us amen amen
[28:11] we sympathize with the message the
[28:13] prophet said oh my God
[28:15] act right oh my God in other words you
[28:18] know what he means sympathize is not
[28:19] like feeling sorry for the message
[28:21] that's not what he's saying that means
[28:23] he's meaning that we just we just kind
[28:26] of take what little bit we we want and
[28:28] one little bit we can do and we kind of
[28:30] go along with what we think is right
[28:34] like I talked to
[28:35] sister's husband there was a he was
[28:38] telling me about the Quran and things
[28:40] and you know he said the Bible's writing
[28:42] places
[28:44] he said we bled
[28:46] I said in other words
[28:49] what I read to you that you want to
[28:51] agree with is Right amen but when it
[28:55] says you don't want to agree with is not
[28:57] right green because it you know that's
[29:00] right all right but now listen look what
[29:03] the prophet of God said about it
[29:05] we find out that on the message 1961's
[29:08] 808 from the house you see now we find
[29:12] out that job was a righteous man
[29:15] no no and when God was testing him they
[29:19] called said and said oh sure
[29:21] when you come up before God with the
[29:23] sons of God he said now evidently Satan
[29:26] must have been covered enough because he
[29:27] could stand the presence of God when I'm
[29:30] understanding his sin in the presence of
[29:31] God
[29:33] is supposed to be annihilated right
[29:35] that's right evidently Satan has some
[29:37] way that God is still using the old boy
[29:39] right when we come up before God when
[29:42] the sons of God he said as God said to
[29:44] him where were where you been he said oh
[29:47] just walking up to and fro and up and
[29:50] down on the Earth
[29:51] see you considered my servant job he's a
[29:55] perfect man amen
[29:57] now that's your Prophet saying drop them
[29:59] down to what's underlined you read the
[30:01] other he's a perfect man and that was
[30:04] before the blood of Jesus Christ was
[30:06] shed see and he said he's a perfect man
[30:08] he's just he's upright there is none
[30:11] like him amen all right right now your
[30:15] Prophet could say he was perfect the
[30:17] Bible says he's perfect amen but do you
[30:19] believe he was perfect
[30:27] don't believe he's perfect I argued with
[30:30] him for about 10 chapters probably amen
[30:34] yep
[30:35] right amen and even eliu which is Christ
[30:39] The Fourth Man when he came to him
[30:43] he didn't argue with him about his
[30:45] Perfection of the atonement right
[30:48] but brother Rome said he told him he was
[30:50] just a little bit too self-righteous
[30:54] that's right well you know what
[30:56] self-righteous means
[30:58] righteousness of yourself not good
[31:01] enough shall righteous in other words he
[31:04] was saying I didn't do it
[31:06] yep
[31:08] I'm not guilty amen
[31:11] but under the blood of Jesus Christ
[31:12] we're guilty of all things
[31:16] under the blood of bulls and goats
[31:19] if you looked at a woman there was no
[31:22] listening to that
[31:24] right amen right it was just you don't
[31:27] do adultery right but when you get the
[31:30] New Testament you start looking then
[31:31] amen changes do different things that's
[31:33] right all right are we talking about it
[31:35] right look at the next one I'm just
[31:37] getting things to worry that you'll
[31:39] you'll hold on to it which is a message
[31:40] here what's the father
[31:42] the prophet of God says what many people
[31:45] want to say because somebody's sick but
[31:48] they did Evil I mean the truth Joe is a
[31:51] perfect man no I said so but sometimes
[31:53] God bless the fix and hear these people
[31:55] and test them for their faith he was
[31:57] testing a saint and not rebuking The
[32:00] Sinner amen amen that's reason I held
[32:03] that
[32:04] he was test testing a saint not rebuking
[32:08] a sinner and God does that to test amen
[32:12] so every time you get sick don't mean
[32:14] that you're
[32:16] doing something wrong right it could
[32:18] mean you've done something right amen
[32:22] you're taller than that amen quit
[32:24] thinking about
[32:25] home and consider sometimes I might be
[32:28] right amen
[32:30] I tried all right but now listen we went
[32:34] through trying to show through the Bible
[32:37] that the prophet of God says under the
[32:39] atonement in the Old Testament
[32:42] that in God's eyes
[32:45] they were perfect amen amen that's why
[32:48] your one atonement was made see you had
[32:51] many atonements for for things you've
[32:53] done individually right
[32:55] amen right Chic adulteries Etc you had
[32:57] things and you had all kind of
[32:59] atonements had to be made for everything
[33:00] a baby born it just had to be done that
[33:02] had to be done all right those were
[33:04] individuals but once a year yep
[33:08] amen that high priest had to go make the
[33:10] atonement for the entire tribe of
[33:13] Israelite amen you know those that were
[33:15] Believers to live under it all right and
[33:17] that's fired them during that year
[33:21] you know
[33:22] because
[33:24] it was what God required amen
[33:27] see that's my point
[33:30] so we can conclude by saying
[33:33] that surely under the atonement of the
[33:35] Old Testament
[33:39] that the people
[33:44] could be called perfect amen
[33:47] sure
[33:50] because
[33:51] of the blood atonement
[33:54] all right so we've been through this now
[33:56] so this review
[33:58] and knowing that that blood atonement
[34:01] every one of them spoke of Jesus Christ
[34:04] amen right to come to make his atonement
[34:08] right so then all sin was just in the
[34:11] Old Testament was just covered right
[34:13] that's right right okay
[34:16] pushing it forward the word Jesus Christ
[34:19] died once for all right amen all right
[34:22] that's why I said the other day I was
[34:24] trying to show you little points along
[34:25] the way that's why that a lot of the Old
[34:28] Testament Saints who don't say all of
[34:30] them so that's a problem but still
[34:33] it says some of them many of them I
[34:36] think it said amen went up with Jesus
[34:40] well you know if it wasn't perfect
[34:43] how could it go up amen must have showed
[34:46] that it was all in Christ they couldn't
[34:48] go up until he came amen that's right
[34:50] that's right so he was the perfect
[34:53] atonement right amen all right then you
[34:55] remember I kept saying it this way then
[34:57] how much more sure should we believe
[35:00] that's it
[35:02] in the New Testament by the blood of
[35:04] Jesus Christ by the new birth
[35:07] that we could say that we are perfect
[35:09] amen amen right
[35:12] because we have the new birth the
[35:15] prophet of God I believe it's in the
[35:16] token I'm pretty sure it's in that one
[35:18] he said God won't impute sin over the
[35:20] token right amen
[35:23] that's why your Old Testament was a
[35:25] Record Keeper all right man that's right
[35:27] all right but it was just a Record
[35:29] Keeper what she done that's right that's
[35:31] right Jim Bill said boy bless God we
[35:32] ain't under Record Keeper no more now
[35:34] we're under Jesus Christ was magnified
[35:36] right amen right he went from the doing
[35:38] to the thoughts right right
[35:42] amen magnified all right
[35:45] what you say like this
[35:47] see I try to write them what people
[35:49] think
[35:51] oh there's a weapons
[35:54] see how much more sure should we believe
[35:56] in that in God's eyes
[36:00] that as long as we're under the
[36:02] atonement right
[36:04] right we're perfect perfect amen that's
[36:05] right amen now did you follow me yes I
[36:08] said under the atonement yeah
[36:11] you remember the man that was blessing
[36:12] with brother randomly put it up today
[36:15] a man with question one brother around
[36:16] him when he was talking on the seal book
[36:19] I brought this quote
[36:20] the man was saying that you know well
[36:24] now there is no altar in heaven
[36:29] you know
[36:31] well see you you run your scriptures
[36:34] and we all talk about in heaven that
[36:36] there's an altar amen and we talk about
[36:38] Jesus Christ on the altar
[36:41] well you can't read that as a direct
[36:45] quote
[36:47] the right and that's what the man was
[36:50] arguing with brother random said there's
[36:52] no altar in heaven in the New Testament
[36:56] he said cause we don't need an altar
[36:58] because the altar is within us in other
[37:00] words
[37:01] all right so here's what the prophet of
[37:03] God had to say about it
[37:04] he said now there's this now if there's
[37:07] no altar of sacrifice in heaven where is
[37:10] the sacrifice for sin lay and then right
[37:12] the lamb there has to be a place where
[37:14] this laying lamb bloody is laying down
[37:16] where the blood is now the incense was
[37:19] the older odorous stuff that they burnt
[37:22] which the Bible said was the price of
[37:24] the Saints now that's the scripture
[37:25] that's right amen that puts your altar
[37:28] see
[37:29] the word that it brings it in the right
[37:31] perspective if there isn't No sacrifice
[37:34] on the altar then the prayers cannot be
[37:37] received right it's only by the blood on
[37:39] the sacrificial altar that lets the
[37:41] prayers go through to God so you better
[37:43] believe whether you own it or can find
[37:46] it or want to take what other people
[37:47] says well there is no scripture it says
[37:49] there's a body laying on the throne well
[37:53] you got a lot of body on the
[37:55] throne
[37:56] you got a lot about that but there is no
[37:58] scripture about that a body is laying on
[38:00] the throne oh there's nothing laying
[38:03] there
[38:05] I don't like it that way you know what I
[38:08] love
[38:08] when he made the atonement
[38:11] my Tomah then was made Eternal all right
[38:14] man come on I have an eternal right
[38:18] atonement how much more would it be than
[38:21] the blood of bulls and ghosts how much
[38:23] more would it be of the blood even of a
[38:25] man amen
[38:29] it's an eternal atonement
[38:32] because it's not one he's not stretched
[38:34] out on the throne waiting on them you
[38:35] know alter waiting on everything to get
[38:37] through no it's a sacrificial altar
[38:41] they were sold under the altar right all
[38:45] right but those will be dealing with the
[38:47] Jews and the thing
[38:48] that's right but see we have one
[38:50] daughter for you and I
[38:52] which is what John 1 verse
[38:55] John 1 John 2 1 says that if we have if
[38:59] we sin we have an advocate right
[39:04] Jesus Christ the righteous amen so we do
[39:07] have one to pay the atonement you don't
[39:10] misunderstand my way of expressing
[39:12] things
[39:12] because I try to make it as blunt as I
[39:15] can to where you won't misunderstand me
[39:17] and you don't have to figure out what
[39:18] I'm talking about
[39:20] I'm telling you what I'm talking about
[39:22] right that's the way I talk you just
[39:24] can't find the Bible scripture you can't
[39:27] find where it says there's every tub
[39:30] will sit on its own bottom
[39:31] that ain't in the Bible amen but we used
[39:34] to quote it can't tell the difference in
[39:37] the season set the button in the trees
[39:39] and she had nothing to leave that ain't
[39:40] in the Bible amen but we quoted it and
[39:43] formed by it but it's not in there right
[39:45] see so if you start running to find a
[39:47] body laying on the throne
[39:50] just remember the sacrificial altar that
[39:53] it was speaking of the word the prayers
[39:55] of the Saints could go through so he's
[39:58] making the atonement that our prayers
[40:00] can go through he doesn't see us the
[40:03] prophet says we're under the blood of
[40:05] Jesus Christ right
[40:07] right right he said the whole world is
[40:10] under the blood or else God would
[40:12] destroy it all right but said he hears
[40:15] my voice amen
[40:18] he hears my voice to the blood all right
[40:22] so then God not sitting by looking down
[40:25] at the blood
[40:26] no these are things that are said
[40:30] to help us to understand
[40:34] all right now
[40:38] back to Matthew 5 48.
[40:40] it says be therefore perfect
[40:44] even as your father in Heaven is perfect
[40:48] and the Bible also says unless you're
[40:50] righteous unless your righteousness
[40:52] exceeds the righteousness right another
[40:56] scribes and
[40:58] Republicans
[41:06] describes and Pharisees right right and
[41:11] have you ever thought about one that
[41:13] says Christ
[41:14] looked like it would have said Sadducees
[41:17] in in Pharisees
[41:22] right
[41:23] come on it looked like it would have
[41:25] said sadly season Pharisees because that
[41:27] would have covered the two groups
[41:29] man all right my dad left everybody else
[41:32] out yes
[41:35] right so he said unless your
[41:37] righteousness exceeds the righteousness
[41:39] of the scribes just the fellas that
[41:41] wrote down times
[41:42] this is the guy sitting in the corner
[41:45] that never had anything to do but right
[41:48] and every day he wrote
[41:51] and they say every time he would come to
[41:53] that word God he glazed him down go take
[41:55] a bath
[41:56] and come back and start writing they say
[41:58] this actually probably what happened to
[42:00] Lazarus the reason that he died he took
[42:03] so many bastards he and writing the
[42:05] Bible I miss it that's what they're
[42:07] saying I don't know it's a good point
[42:09] but my point is it didn't say the fair
[42:11] season said you see because that would
[42:13] have been to two religious gods right
[42:15] Joy putting the scribes
[42:17] where it would just be me and you
[42:21] you know everybody because they had a
[42:23] righteousness too amen under the
[42:26] atonement right amen but unless our
[42:29] righteousness
[42:31] exceeds that now how can our
[42:33] righteousness exceed
[42:36] those guys wind
[42:39] that's what I said that guy with natural
[42:40] muscle he probably take a bath every
[42:42] time you see the word God and they don't
[42:44] ride it out they got their code will say
[42:46] it all right but
[42:48] then
[42:50] the high priest
[42:53] would be killed for any sin he committed
[42:58] to unless our righteousness exceeds that
[43:00] what can we do
[43:03] now how can it exceed that
[43:06] right well I'm forgiven brother Dale and
[43:09] maybe you're getting me lined up a
[43:11] little bit but I can see that I'm
[43:12] perfect but I'm not righteous
[43:16] let's look up the word righteous that's
[43:19] right amen amen it means to be right
[43:21] right man simple amen you don't have to
[43:25] find all these great big words to
[43:26] describe everything just look it up
[43:30] righteousness means the state of being
[43:32] right
[43:34] well if you're forgiven you're right
[43:38] amen but of course we don't believe in
[43:40] that because we don't forgive
[43:41] all right we forgive but we don't forget
[43:45] then we say well let him ask me to
[43:48] forgive him I'll forgiven that's not
[43:49] Bible
[43:51] according to mark
[43:54] which we cover has to be in the speaking
[43:56] of the word
[43:57] saying to this mountain he goes on down
[43:59] a little further there and says if you
[44:00] won't forgive you won't be forgiven
[44:01] that's right yeah but we don't want that
[44:04] we don't speak the word speak the word
[44:07] you know we'll forgive right right amen
[44:11] that's right but you can't be forgiven
[44:13] if you want all right and you're not
[44:15] going to come to speak into the word
[44:16] right right see this is going away on
[44:19] down to message I mean I just drop in a
[44:21] little bit along the way amen all right
[44:23] but look
[44:26] look what brother Brown had to say on it
[44:29] go ahead Brazil number three
[44:34] the thoughts are being perfect
[44:39] the thoughts are being perfect amen
[44:45] now watch what he says
[44:47] this is off the first seal 1963-18 ever
[44:51] born again believer True Believer is
[44:53] perfectly absolutely sinless
[44:56] amen he's not trusting in his Works come
[45:00] on in the blood of Jesus Christ and his
[45:02] confessions dropped into
[45:05] the Bible says so
[45:07] you know a lot of people read and they
[45:10] put their definitions and and they I'm
[45:13] not arguing with him about they the way
[45:15] they say things but if you read that
[45:16] naturally across her and you've got a
[45:17] problem
[45:18] amen so you ought to read by Revelation
[45:20] and sit across what you read right let
[45:22] me read that to you and see what you say
[45:26] every morning again believer True
[45:28] Believer is perfectly absolutely sinless
[45:30] before God he's not trusting in his
[45:31] works in the blood of Jesus Christ and
[45:33] his confession dropped into it that'll
[45:35] look like right around said he's not
[45:36] trusting him
[45:38] I quoted all in one sentence
[45:40] make sure to stop that
[45:43] and broke it up into two sentences but
[45:45] they only put a comma
[45:49] I didn't break it down just separated
[45:51] that a long way to put me some branches
[45:54] around it if you see what I'm talking
[45:55] about they put the computer and I had to
[45:57] put a parenthesis around this thing
[45:59] because it looked like brother random
[46:01] would be saying that you're not trusting
[46:02] no we're trusting in the blood of Jesus
[46:04] Christ
[46:07] you see you say well I said what brought
[46:09] around said run around and said that I'm
[46:11] not pressing in the blood of Jesus
[46:13] Christ he didn't say that amen that's
[46:15] two different sentences
[46:17] not the way we read okay
[46:19] the Bible says so see he that that is
[46:22] born of God does not commit sin for he
[46:24] cannot sin
[46:26] after you make a man a sinner when the
[46:28] bleach of the blood of Jesus Christ and
[46:30] between him and God that would scatter
[46:32] sin Till There be nothing left of it
[46:34] right see how can that pure blood of
[46:37] Christ ever let his sin pass there
[46:40] he cannot Jesus said be therefore
[46:43] perfect even as your father in Heaven is
[46:45] perfect and how could we ever start the
[46:47] thought of being perfect
[46:49] but Jesus required it if Jesus required
[46:53] it he's got to make a way for it and he
[46:55] has his own blood that's right yeah
[46:59] now that's why job see
[47:03] he could see that he was right right
[47:07] now you understand what brother Brown
[47:08] would come along and even eliu the
[47:11] Chrysler would rebuke Joseph
[47:14] you see Joe couldn't see Christ
[47:16] the way he wanted to see
[47:18] but once he made his stand then he seen
[47:21] Christ did I know my redeemer lived but
[47:24] when he was in his own self he could
[47:25] only see I'm not guilty right he
[47:28] couldn't see that somebody had to come
[47:31] and if that somebody didn't come to take
[47:34] job's atonement confession and bring him
[47:38] before God
[47:40] through the Lord Jesus Christ
[47:42] he was in self-righteousness
[47:46] are you listening
[47:49] see he had he was looking he wasn't
[47:52] looking for somebody else to come right
[47:55] come on read the book a joke man he
[47:57] wasn't looking for somebody else to come
[47:59] but once he's seen
[48:01] God's moving up and then he said I know
[48:05] my redeemer a little bit
[48:06] seeing one that would come that would
[48:09] not only cover his sins
[48:11] but we're eradicate them right amen
[48:14] well that guy couldn't eradicates right
[48:17] right man but Iran uses the word divorce
[48:19] we'll get to it right
[48:21] all right you couldn't be divorced in
[48:23] the Old Testament man right he couldn't
[48:26] be eradicated see
[48:28] do we have the house some way to make it
[48:30] if he requires for us to be perfect he
[48:32] had to make a way good to make some
[48:33] Brother John
[48:35] you had to make the neck that's perfect
[48:37] right this is unless you call Perfection
[48:39] 1957.
[48:42] well I hope this soaks way down deep now
[48:45] look
[48:46] God knows he had sheep and it's working
[48:50] he knowed he was going to have a people
[48:52] to be saved
[48:53] and his love looked down and seen those
[48:56] who would be saved their four by four
[48:59] knowledge he predestinated the church to
[49:02] meet him Yonder without spot or wrinkle
[49:04] and if God required a church without
[49:07] much now Sparta wrinkled he had to have
[49:10] something to make it that way he could
[49:13] not require his Justice
[49:15] his judgment could not let him ask such
[49:18] a thing if there wasn't a way to make it
[49:21] amen
[49:23] right
[49:25] he made the way amen that job
[49:31] that was perfect because he was innocent
[49:36] yeah
[49:38] not guilty and even if you sinned and he
[49:42] forgives you you're not guilty you're
[49:45] perfect amen
[49:47] could it no difference and not guilty
[49:49] and perfect
[49:53] but see job didn't see one to come
[49:57] until the Bell strung on him until the
[50:00] Lord got to it then he seen it amen
[50:03] right amen
[50:05] he seen the Redeemer coming all right
[50:07] amen
[50:08] didn't even make that statement isn't it
[50:13] he couldn't do it until God wrote it
[50:16] back and he seen the one that was to
[50:18] eradicate his sins
[50:22] right because you didn't have any
[50:25] all right
[50:26] he didn't have any to eradicate there
[50:28] was already covered amen
[50:30] amen but you see it was this it was what
[50:33] he had to go through Jesus Christ had to
[50:35] make a way through his blood that's
[50:37] right to take those that were not
[50:40] perfect
[50:41] in their natural right
[50:44] but bring them to a
[50:46] point that he had said they were perfect
[50:49] under his atonement right
[50:51] within when the atonement came the
[50:54] atonement right right okay which was God
[50:57] himself and he in human flesh
[51:00] see then when it happened joke seen him
[51:04] coming and he knew his sins was
[51:06] eradicated
[51:07] who didn't have any trouble in the
[51:10] resurrection that's right
[51:13] he was able to rise in the resurrection
[51:16] man
[51:17] why because the perfect one had come
[51:22] and eradicated sin amen well now if he
[51:25] eradicated it that way
[51:29] come on I like to do this I know I mean
[51:32] I'm hateful I love to preach it too I
[51:35] like to get you out on a limb where
[51:37] you'll let him in at least shake your
[51:38] head coach brother Donnie says that's
[51:39] good amen
[51:41] but at least you have to agree what to
[51:43] say he doesn't like to come up with a
[51:44] statement
[51:49] yeah if we believe he eradicated for
[51:51] them
[51:55] if he didn't do it all at one time he's
[51:58] got to come back and die again
[52:02] are you listening if he only eradicated
[52:06] their sins if he didn't eradicate ours
[52:09] right man he's not to come back and die
[52:12] again and according to my Bible he
[52:13] doesn't do it right according to my
[52:16] Bible he died one time
[52:19] and he will be eradicated
[52:25] why are we concerned with this way right
[52:27] man amen
[52:30] you sure look it was like that then I'm
[52:32] just living like the devil go ahead come
[52:34] on
[52:36] amen yeah bless who you are amen oh
[52:41] you're preaching a greasy Grace you
[52:44] don't just do anything no I'm not man
[52:47] because see you don't follow me
[52:48] everybody don't hear me all the time I
[52:51] don't believe everybody in the Old
[52:52] Testament they took a lamb and walked up
[52:54] I preached it to you for 40 years I've
[52:56] got to take a lamb walk up and throw it
[52:57] down turn around and walk off say I'm
[52:59] forgive me I don't believe he was amen
[53:02] he was capabled by the one atonement
[53:04] that was made for Israel but that sin
[53:07] remained
[53:10] come on we'll get down to where we was
[53:12] with Moses in a minute that sin remains
[53:16] you see him saying there's a Christian
[53:18] the prophet but God says you will reap a
[53:20] toad before
[53:22] now that's your prostitute
[53:25] because I can just go out and live like
[53:26] the devil go ahead
[53:28] because if you're a Christian you got a
[53:31] robe full of helpful to get on you right
[53:33] because every devil in hell is going to
[53:35] come after you
[53:36] so we're here
[53:39] well I got bad with that
[53:42] Lord didn't that's what he thought yeah
[53:44] he's taught in the garden
[53:47] because God didn't come down
[53:50] she thought she got by
[53:52] but he was right he said today you eaten
[53:55] around so she never lived a thousand
[53:56] years amen he was right she was the one
[53:59] that hadn't messed up where do you
[54:01] follow him
[54:04] see
[54:06] then the Old Testament people according
[54:08] to the fact that they would accept what
[54:12] God Said
[54:14] to them
[54:15] and do it sincerely because you remember
[54:17] we bring it out the other day he got
[54:19] where he said you're you're sacrificing
[54:21] offers you become a streak in my mouth
[54:23] right yeah
[54:25] come on that's what God had to say about
[54:27] it right right but you see a man he said
[54:30] who'd I Look to a man with an honest and
[54:32] a sincere heart that's right amen
[54:36] who feareth God and when his order to
[54:40] shoot us another word goes away from
[54:41] evil
[54:42] so you go ahead and think you can just
[54:44] live like the devil long you want to
[54:45] because you're that's a good old Baptist
[54:47] once saved always saved right I didn't
[54:50] believe that not the Baptist Church
[54:53] as a deacon for there for five years and
[54:55] I didn't believe it then and I certainly
[54:57] don't believe it now right right
[55:01] man standing I told you about a no
[55:02] because standing out there one day
[55:04] looking at these women walking down
[55:05] through there I said sir I said that's
[55:07] not right
[55:07] he said oh the Bible says look on God's
[55:10] heritage
[55:11] he was old enough to be my daddy matter
[55:13] of fact the worst came through
[55:15] I looked at him and I'm in it just as
[55:17] much as I mean today I said it don't say
[55:19] lust after
[55:22] they don't say that see I was against it
[55:25] then I'm certainly against sin today
[55:27] people think that I'm trying to preach
[55:29] some kind of a greasy Grace no you seen
[55:32] a sin as a Christian you'll reap It Up
[55:34] full fight that's me you and everybody
[55:37] come on even your prophet
[55:40] amen said a word to his wife there one
[55:42] day and went over to pray for a baby and
[55:44] God come down and says you go make that
[55:47] right or not to his wife about to it was
[55:49] to his wife but it was about the income
[55:51] tax guy tell him I'm not here you take
[55:55] your hand off that baby
[55:58] he went and made it right and he come
[55:59] back said give me the baby now
[56:01] remember what happened
[56:05] and listen
[56:07] then they had to believe
[56:11] now that's my emphasis
[56:13] the people of the Old Testament had to
[56:14] believe right right it wasn't just
[56:16] offering off right
[56:19] that's why I believe that it said many
[56:21] it doesn't say all the Old Testament
[56:22] changed it just says many of them well
[56:25] where's the other
[56:27] if meaning was 99 but still one percent
[56:30] amen right
[56:33] right see because it their atonement was
[56:35] not accepted for them amen that's right
[56:38] but they were covered by the blood of
[56:41] the sacrificial lamb just like today
[56:45] the prophet of God said there is a
[56:47] buffered blood of the blood of Jesus
[56:49] Christ that covers this world and if it
[56:51] wasn't for that we would be annihilate
[56:54] it come on
[56:56] we're still here taking care of us amen
[56:59] right even though you say you're a
[57:01] Christian they ain't sin in 40 years
[57:03] that's what Jack Cole said that lady
[57:05] told him that he said lady sit down shut
[57:06] up you're the biggest sinner here
[57:08] that was a good point amen
[57:12] I like what he said there one time he
[57:13] told the lady said I want to lay my
[57:15] tongue out on this altar because I got a
[57:17] long tongue he said Lady it's only 14
[57:19] foot ain't enough all over here
[57:24] he was tough
[57:26] but he was right
[57:28] see church we must accept what God Said
[57:32] all right now get to Point what I'm
[57:34] saying
[57:36] they had to accept that lamb was dying
[57:38] for them blood around said you laid your
[57:39] hands on the animal right and said when
[57:42] they cut it the blood was frailing all
[57:44] over you amen and said you believe it's
[57:46] your sins was transmitted to that animal
[57:48] right man now
[57:51] it's not just haphazard just do it I'll
[57:54] send it up by Joe he's okay let him take
[57:55] it on for me no won't work Joe with it
[57:58] amen that'll be ourselves right but
[58:01] listen
[58:02] if we believe it that way then why would
[58:04] we believe in any formal thinking that
[58:06] under the blood of Jesus Christ we could
[58:08] go out and live like the devil and get
[58:09] my way
[58:13] come on Amen if you don't see what I
[58:17] believe about it you've got a mental
[58:18] capacity problem what I'm saying under
[58:22] the blood of bulls and goats they
[58:25] believed in it
[58:26] we might flee Jesus Christ paid the
[58:29] price
[58:30] amen sure you make a mistake hoping
[58:33] brother Brown you don't like me no we'll
[58:35] quote him right around you sin he said
[58:37] every day
[58:39] is that a quote amen amen what he said
[58:43] he said I see him every day
[58:45] really random did you disbelieve no no
[58:50] no sin has degrees up and down we've
[58:53] reset for 40 years you ought to know it
[58:57] it was a little mistakes he made in life
[58:59] right but they're still singing right
[59:01] when my Bible said that anything is not
[59:04] a faith is what
[59:05] sin
[59:07] that's right
[59:08] so you see where we're at
[59:10] seeing that if you magnify it under the
[59:13] New Testament
[59:15] like I said lust and back tire wouldn't
[59:17] they're not making a tone for luster
[59:20] there may be atonement for doing it
[59:22] we've got to make this and we got to
[59:24] have an atonement for the thinking about
[59:26] it
[59:35] right
[59:36] you remember what I was trying to bring
[59:37] out
[59:40] learn the scripture in Exodus 32.
[59:43] where the when the children of Israel
[59:45] made a golden Cali
[59:48] go down and read there about the 30th
[59:50] verse from 32 chapter 32 where Moses
[59:53] said
[59:55] pre-adventure I shall go up and make an
[59:57] atonement
[59:58] man
[1:00:00] I want you to show me what animal he
[1:00:02] offered
[1:00:04] all right come on all right you know my
[1:00:07] Bible search the rest of the scripture
[1:00:09] if you want to there's no record he
[1:00:11] offered any animal all right that's
[1:00:13] right you know what he done
[1:00:15] he reminded God
[1:00:18] nice mom wrote around and said
[1:00:20] and I always wondered
[1:00:22] how Moses could tell a god a better way
[1:00:25] of doing something
[1:00:27] he said if I found out it was Christ
[1:00:29] amen
[1:00:31] he never sacrificed one animal up there
[1:00:34] Moses did he didn't take nothing up no
[1:00:37] blood went up
[1:00:41] he went up himself and he went before
[1:00:43] God and he said God that's right if you
[1:00:46] destroy them destroy me
[1:00:48] then run around and puts that scripture
[1:00:50] together with the other scripture word
[1:00:52] that he's relating it that Moses reminds
[1:00:55] God or one of them reminds God there
[1:00:57] said it would be said that you could
[1:00:58] bring him out but you can't take them in
[1:01:00] amen he reminded him of his word that's
[1:01:04] why I asked you the question I keep
[1:01:06] asking it which is right do we believe
[1:01:08] in the atonement that covers sin or does
[1:01:10] God's word cover sin
[1:01:14] come on natural I know what I preached
[1:01:16] to you we got to make the atonement it
[1:01:17] was made
[1:01:18] but who forgave Adam and Eve right
[1:01:21] before
[1:01:23] Adam and Eve stood before God is
[1:01:25] centered right right and God offered to
[1:01:29] sacrifice
[1:01:30] but his word that he said in heaven
[1:01:34] right
[1:01:37] that's right amen so when God says the
[1:01:41] atonement is what I say that's what he
[1:01:43] says that's right when he says you
[1:01:45] believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:01:47] thou shalt be saved that's exactly what
[1:01:49] he meant amen
[1:01:53] all right by his word amen that's what
[1:01:57] I'm trying to get you to see
[1:02:01] I'm trying to get you to see one thing
[1:02:03] we got to believe what man said
[1:02:06] amen that's right
[1:02:09] don't quote right around him
[1:02:11] he said I already get one man believe
[1:02:13] what another man say yes amen right
[1:02:15] it's when we have trouble with the Bible
[1:02:19] oh shut up
[1:02:31] father son Holy Ghost said all kind of
[1:02:34] things
[1:02:35] security Baptist Bible convert them to
[1:02:37] baptist Faith what you do
[1:02:39] I still believe every word in here I
[1:02:41] said and I couldn't find out that
[1:02:43] there's a lot of things I didn't that
[1:02:45] the Bible didn't say that I believed
[1:02:46] right right
[1:02:49] but listen
[1:02:53] you know man wrote this right yeah right
[1:02:56] no no my brother Dave you don't
[1:02:58] understand God no come on I know you
[1:03:01] were out no sense no that's what I'm
[1:03:03] talking about
[1:03:04] you want to go back to the history of
[1:03:06] the writing of the the King James
[1:03:07] version with me
[1:03:12] set them down and gave them the little
[1:03:15] Scrolls and said translate it amen and
[1:03:19] when they came out to translate it from
[1:03:20] the Greek and the things of the New
[1:03:22] Testament not even the old but the new
[1:03:24] when they came out to do that if it
[1:03:26] didn't compare exactly they threw that
[1:03:28] now amen but when they came up with all
[1:03:31] of the groups
[1:03:32] and you know it had to be the holy
[1:03:34] spirit amen so my Bible said the Holy
[1:03:38] Ghost let right he led them to write it
[1:03:40] all right amen right sure but a man
[1:03:43] wrote it down
[1:03:45] and then a man came in the last day
[1:03:48] Hallelujah
[1:03:50] to tell us what did they said that's
[1:03:53] right man
[1:03:55] a man goes out in Arizona I mean I
[1:03:57] turned he goes up and he gets the grace
[1:04:00] of marriage in divorce amen well
[1:04:03] everybody wants to believe that they
[1:04:04] don't believe those things he said
[1:04:06] they ain't gonna deny that one
[1:04:09] oh yeah yeah he set me free yeah yeah
[1:04:12] the words of a man
[1:04:14] amen right
[1:04:16] you said brother
[1:04:19] your carnal how much carnal Moses was a
[1:04:23] man right and Moses said God
[1:04:26] you destroy them you got to destroy me
[1:04:28] first that's right I was a man
[1:04:32] he said God I'll remind you you said
[1:04:34] you're going to take a man all right
[1:04:36] amen
[1:04:37] and you know that wasn't there it was a
[1:04:39] cross that Moses didn't get to go in
[1:04:40] because we called her smiling the rock
[1:04:42] but tonight he went over here
[1:04:48] always in the temple right by the side
[1:04:50] of Moses read your Bible he stayed there
[1:04:54] Moses said you stay in the temple
[1:04:57] why he had to learn about a God that
[1:05:01] would hear the words of a man
[1:05:04] man all right
[1:05:06] come on God would hear the word to a man
[1:05:12] and that man could stand her as God for
[1:05:16] the people
[1:05:17] amen am I quoting brother ran right he
[1:05:19] said while Moses were speaking he was
[1:05:21] God he said when he fell back he was
[1:05:23] Moses so that didn't make him her God
[1:05:28] brother random was telling us the
[1:05:29] message he was God but when he stepped
[1:05:31] back he's brother Brown
[1:05:32] yeah amen he's not my God these two back
[1:05:36] here behind a lot of people don't
[1:05:37] understand why I have him there
[1:05:39] a lot of people don't even know the
[1:05:40] story of of Michelangelo he painted a
[1:05:44] picture of of Jesus Christ at 30 years
[1:05:46] of age
[1:05:49] this is the one over here excuse me
[1:05:51] there's nowhere no that's right over
[1:05:52] here
[1:05:53] 30 years of age he paid him one at 33.
[1:05:57] you come and look Kaufman
[1:05:59] I might send it wrong but you know what
[1:06:01] I like because I'm in the middle
[1:06:04] that's what happened to that man to
[1:06:06] break me
[1:06:07] that's why they're back there
[1:06:10] he looked like he's over 50 years old in
[1:06:13] the last one even the story is that
[1:06:15] Hoffman wrote in in the inability to
[1:06:18] paint because of the lines were so
[1:06:21] perfect after it but he painted two
[1:06:23] pictures
[1:06:24] one of thirty and one of 33.
[1:06:28] it took you and I had to make that
[1:06:29] that's right yeah it made him a sinner
[1:06:33] for me
[1:06:34] he said but Hebrews 1 says yeah that's
[1:06:38] what I like Hebrews 1 said God in tundra
[1:06:42] time in diverse manners fake by but how
[1:06:46] did the prophet translate it in right
[1:06:50] amen
[1:06:55] you had to believe that man was God's
[1:06:57] future
[1:07:00] when I wrote around and said some things
[1:07:01] was wrong they're saying today I know he
[1:07:04] did when he said when I was right or I
[1:07:06] agree
[1:07:07] because there was nobody could correct
[1:07:09] him amen before they're good at it now
[1:07:12] but they wouldn't nobody could correct
[1:07:14] him amen because the sealed has not been
[1:07:17] broke
[1:07:26] he stands before God but he stands
[1:07:28] between us and God right amen like I
[1:07:31] said we're glad to say the grace of
[1:07:33] marriage endorse is mine but then when
[1:07:35] he says that Jesus was almighty God then
[1:07:37] they want to make him a man
[1:07:39] they want to make him a second person
[1:07:41] yeah they want to make him another
[1:07:43] identity these brothers what they're
[1:07:45] saying
[1:07:46] but you understand going on with it I'm
[1:07:48] sorry
[1:07:50] God I just can't see it in the Bible
[1:07:56] it's just like we're good to it this
[1:07:57] afternoon you know that running around
[1:07:58] and said if you don't believe you're
[1:08:00] perfect
[1:08:02] you'll get it this afternoon amen he
[1:08:05] said if you don't believe you're perfect
[1:08:07] you're lost right that's right
[1:08:11] solve it let him say it all right we'll
[1:08:13] get back this afternoon in case you miss
[1:08:15] it it's on the last book of life

[1:08:24] of life 1956 uh 607
[1:08:28] paragraph e35
[1:08:31] he said if you don't believe you're
[1:08:33] perfect you're lost
[1:08:36] that's right so we're either lost or
[1:08:39] saved that's it we'll get to that you
[1:08:42] see you're either a sinner or a sign and
[1:08:45] there is no white black bird right
[1:08:52] okay
[1:08:54] I thought I'd have some questions about
[1:08:56] what the brother said during this past
[1:08:57] Wednesday I thought some of your sisters
[1:08:59] would be asking me about that do you
[1:09:00] remember how you brought it out he's
[1:09:02] bringing out how's it the women you know
[1:09:03] and how they're supposed to be
[1:09:05] not supposed to be subjects in all
[1:09:07] things well now you can make that say
[1:09:09] what you want to right amen
[1:09:14] I think the brother said it right yeah I
[1:09:16] didn't argue with him that's right I
[1:09:18] just thought some of you come up say you
[1:09:19] mean I got to be in subject and
[1:09:21] everything because you already know what
[1:09:22] I preached
[1:09:25] you already know
[1:09:27] wrote a brown said a woman know how to
[1:09:28] be subject to the man if he tries to get
[1:09:31] her to do something contrary to the word
[1:09:32] amen right right
[1:09:35] we've done preached that okay
[1:09:38] she don't have to do wrong things
[1:09:40] because he says that says it for her to
[1:09:42] do it right that's right amen amen she
[1:09:45] don't have to be on the subject but at
[1:09:47] the same time yes sir that's right
[1:09:50] she can't refuse to be his wife amen
[1:09:54] amen

[1:10:10] makes you remember it
[1:10:12] but she used to be under subjection
[1:10:15] in all things amen that is not contrary
[1:10:19] to work
[1:10:22] because you know what I've said to you
[1:10:24] see your husband tells you do something
[1:10:25] this country the word you say a little
[1:10:27] devil don't tell me I don't have to do
[1:10:28] that now that's not right
[1:10:31] that he tells you to cook him something
[1:10:32] to eat and you say bless Garden like I
[1:10:34] told sister or sister Cooney sister
[1:10:36] truly Rucker drive 250 miles to get down
[1:10:39] here and I spoke right straight to her
[1:10:41] place right over there one day I said
[1:10:42] you go home and you get back home after
[1:10:44] driving five hours you walk in the house
[1:10:48] right
[1:10:57] if he tells you you can't go to church
[1:10:58] where you want to because it's a better
[1:11:00] word then you don't have to obey amen
[1:11:04] see you can say in all things in the
[1:11:08] legs a big old open space don't you man
[1:11:10] man down at work one day was telling me
[1:11:12] that and he wouldn't even believe her
[1:11:13] this message
[1:11:17] she's supposed to do it
[1:11:19] I know I'm carnal I'm sorry I just said
[1:11:22] you mean tell me if you tell your wife
[1:11:24] you got to go come into adultery she's
[1:11:25] got to go do it and he said yes sir I
[1:11:27] said you lying hypocrite amen I said you
[1:11:30] ain't nothing with the devil yeah that's
[1:11:31] right
[1:11:33] oh let me back up all right
[1:11:36] I said you remember the devil thinking
[1:11:38] something like that amen I said cheap to
[1:11:40] be under subjection to you as my wife is
[1:11:42] to a husband all right and but not
[1:11:45] because you go tell her to do something
[1:11:47] I thought I'd get that truck cover it
[1:11:49] okay
[1:11:50] but now listen
[1:11:55] see we're talking about the word yeah
[1:11:58] that's when we read in John
[1:12:01] that
[1:12:03] knows disciples come to Jesus
[1:12:09] the story lies you know and all the
[1:12:11] things unless you need to flesh that's
[1:12:12] on the man all the different things
[1:12:14] a lot of people walked away he turned to
[1:12:17] the 12 and he said
[1:12:18] and I've got your quotes here if you
[1:12:19] want we'll probably have time to read
[1:12:21] them but you know what right around said
[1:12:26] he he turned to them he said why don't
[1:12:28] you go to
[1:12:29] amen
[1:12:31] or why don't you go so well also or do
[1:12:34] you want to go
[1:12:36] it makes it what
[1:12:39] amen were
[1:12:45] right into the next brother you'll
[1:12:47] Escape how can I have this thing if I
[1:12:48] cut the other fuel
[1:12:50] number five
[1:12:51] let's see what it is I went on a relief
[1:12:53] I gotta read this and cut away
[1:12:55] listen what you probably had to say on
[1:12:57] the message to whom would we go 1960 606
[1:13:01] because Peter had found something in
[1:13:03] Jesus that isn't in other men that's the
[1:13:05] reason he said to whom would we go
[1:13:08] Now read it right he didn't say where
[1:13:11] will we go right I like that all right
[1:13:13] all right now I did another quote wrote
[1:13:16] around says and he was mentioned he'd be
[1:13:18] going along and he said where do we go
[1:13:19] but look what he's just saying why did
[1:13:21] he say it like that he didn't say where
[1:13:23] will we go
[1:13:25] amen because that means you leave this
[1:13:28] church and go to that church and go over
[1:13:29] here and you go over there you go here a
[1:13:31] while you go there well you run here
[1:13:32] where do we go
[1:13:36] no no
[1:13:38] you didn't say where we know he said to
[1:13:39] whom will we go all right amen exactly
[1:13:42] not changing Church it ain't no problem
[1:13:44] because we go to him which is the word
[1:13:46] amen the prophet of God said the only
[1:13:49] reason you have to leave your church is
[1:13:51] be called
[1:13:52] the demand got off the word amen
[1:14:00] I mean not to worry but to whom amen now
[1:14:03] that's the words
[1:14:05] of eternal life amen
[1:14:08] I told you this is still the Old
[1:14:09] Testament
[1:14:11] now that's the words of eternal life
[1:14:14] he act like the other man didn't have
[1:14:17] that's what made the difference all
[1:14:19] right man
[1:14:21] get in the word so eternal life
[1:14:23] there was that Christ that was standing
[1:14:26] in Moses amen right you could tell God a
[1:14:30] better way of doing something inside of
[1:14:32] that man not the flesh come on man
[1:14:34] but inside of that man was the same God
[1:14:38] amen
[1:14:44] who were to whom shall we know that not
[1:14:48] where do we go
[1:14:51] we go to the word all right amen that's
[1:14:54] right not man following stuff it's the
[1:14:57] word that's right yeah exactly
[1:15:01] see God used a man to speak
[1:15:05] and honored his word I gave you the
[1:15:07] quotes where I wrote around and said
[1:15:08] that he could not go over Moses read it
[1:15:11] if you want it I'll be glad to give them
[1:15:12] to you he said he commissioned Moses for
[1:15:14] the job he said thereby couldn't go over
[1:15:16] him right that's right that's right
[1:15:19] around his words amen you couldn't go
[1:15:21] over Moses
[1:15:23] because he ordained him to lead him
[1:15:24] through he said he didn't lead him
[1:15:27] through he only got it so far he got him
[1:15:29] that far how far have you been amen
[1:15:34] you at least got him to the land
[1:15:36] amen all right I like it that way
[1:15:39] brother one time told me here said God
[1:15:42] told me to come to the Lord where
[1:15:43] there's a Moses Ministry I said yep
[1:15:45] you're here now this Moses if you're
[1:15:48] going to try to top me don't do it
[1:15:50] because Moses died so I don't do that
[1:15:53] but I said second off
[1:15:55] now Joshua was going to take you over
[1:15:57] because brother Dale can't do it he can
[1:16:00] lead you to the land but he can't take
[1:16:02] it in amen I can tell you the message
[1:16:05] but I can't I can't interpret it to you
[1:16:08] all right man the Holy Ghost is the only
[1:16:10] interpreter in the world
[1:16:12] can we see where we're at right until
[1:16:15] the disciples said
[1:16:20] we go amen thou Hast the words
[1:16:28] that's right
[1:16:33] Moses went before God and spoke the
[1:16:36] words of eternal life
[1:16:39] amen
[1:16:40] come on you didn't make the people
[1:16:42] eternally he spoken about because God
[1:16:43] said I'll kill him when I get ready
[1:16:45] listen I'll let it go now
[1:16:47] right amen right read your Bible he said
[1:16:50] I'll let it go but he said when the day
[1:16:52] comes I'll deal with that amen
[1:16:56] see
[1:16:57] run around Kane
[1:16:59] with the words of eternal life
[1:17:04] I like to really arrested these numbers
[1:17:05] for later
[1:17:09] the words of eternal life
[1:17:13] that's something to me
[1:17:15] right
[1:17:17] I just felt like that that's a million
[1:17:19] bucks to me amen
[1:17:23] right right
[1:17:24] the words are eternal life right amen
[1:17:28] this message wrote eternal life to me
[1:17:31] amen
[1:17:33] and come on now as a deacon for five
[1:17:36] years
[1:17:37] I joined the church when I was 18. I was
[1:17:40] teaching when I left the adult Sunday
[1:17:43] School classes which was the deakers and
[1:17:45] deacons and elders and their wives and I
[1:17:47] was
[1:17:48] 20 no 10 years ago
[1:17:52] I was a deacon at 23 years old
[1:17:56] so you know they had a lot of respect
[1:17:57] about it and
[1:18:00] you know what
[1:18:02] when I came into this message
[1:18:05] you heard me tell that I've read six
[1:18:08] books a day and listened to two types
[1:18:10] all in one day
[1:18:13] not every day but I've done it
[1:18:15] really colleague and witness because he
[1:18:17] used to be right there with him
[1:18:19] and I just sitting there and made it my
[1:18:21] wife and them could witness it neighbor
[1:18:23] said another here the other day he's up
[1:18:26] the house Phil was doing something he
[1:18:28] said I remember when we used to walk
[1:18:29] through the house here and that man
[1:18:30] preach
[1:18:31] that's a neighbor's boy and we play
[1:18:34] tapes we listen to the message
[1:18:37] but you know when I come in this message
[1:18:38] actually and I didn't have eternal life
[1:18:41] I didn't do what 98 of the people of
[1:18:43] this message say I know I had eternal
[1:18:46] life or I wouldn't have come to the
[1:18:47] message
[1:18:50] when I seen the message I know that I
[1:18:53] didn't have eternal life and yet I was
[1:18:55] justified and Sanctified I know that
[1:18:59] I knew that part
[1:19:00] I knew God was in my life and I knew
[1:19:03] things and seen things
[1:19:04] you heard me to it
[1:19:07] seen things that the people in this
[1:19:09] message would love to see today
[1:19:12] but yet I knew I didn't have eternal
[1:19:16] life
[1:19:19] you know what
[1:19:21] I didn't have the words of eternal life
[1:19:24] right
[1:19:25] what do you mean you read the Bible no I
[1:19:29] read it with the wrong prices amen right
[1:19:32] you did too
[1:19:33] the Bible never said baptized father son
[1:19:36] and I want to go and the Bible never
[1:19:38] said hell was eternal
[1:19:40] ever said these things
[1:19:42] right
[1:19:44] that's what we read right
[1:19:47] and when I seen that and I've seen where
[1:19:50] he was explaining then the birth is the
[1:19:52] birth of the word right
[1:19:54] and Hugh Matthew was right when he said
[1:19:56] the story right forth and soul and the
[1:19:58] seed and the life and some came to life
[1:20:01] and
[1:20:02] I knew right then
[1:20:04] I didn't have anywhere
[1:20:08] every time an all the call was given I
[1:20:10] was in the altar crying
[1:20:13] two years
[1:20:16] well you do believe
[1:20:18] yeah come on folks amen you know the way
[1:20:22] I preach now that's the way I talk now
[1:20:26] my son I'm sitting right there when he's
[1:20:27] 12 13 years old I put in his 90 of the
[1:20:30] preacher that was in this message as far
[1:20:31] as being able to quote run around and
[1:20:33] quote him correctly
[1:20:35] and go back up
[1:20:36] I say what I mean and I mean what I say
[1:20:38] because it was true
[1:20:40] he came to me after he come back to the
[1:20:42] Lord he come to me and said brother
[1:20:43] Daddy what does this mean I said it
[1:20:45] means so enjoy he said how come I had to
[1:20:46] talk I said cause he's been laying there
[1:20:48] ever since you read it amen waiting on
[1:20:50] to be made alive
[1:20:53] man I'm trying you didn't come to me and
[1:20:56] I said okay now my son all you need to
[1:20:58] do is y'all don't start preaching
[1:20:59] no you come to me I said you need God
[1:21:01] you need the Holy Ghost
[1:21:03] and he saw God in July
[1:21:07] not Daddy telling me
[1:21:10] God told me you're gonna be standing in
[1:21:12] the puppy and I had witnessed in my life
[1:21:13] I told her I told her I said don't you
[1:21:15] tell nobody
[1:21:16] just forbidden to mention it to anyone
[1:21:19] amen
[1:21:20] one day he couldn't do it he said Daddy
[1:21:22] I want to talk to you I said you don't
[1:21:23] want to talk to me
[1:21:25] most preachers in this message with a
[1:21:27] son coming up like that would say son
[1:21:29] you're preaching Sunday I said no you
[1:21:31] don't want to talk to me you got to talk
[1:21:32] to your daddy amen the one you found out
[1:21:35] to be your real daddy you go talk to him
[1:21:37] about it but I said run son until God
[1:21:39] runs you down about eight months later
[1:21:41] he comes he said Daddy I'm ready I said
[1:21:43] you preaching Sunday
[1:21:44] amen
[1:21:47] why because I don't believe in playing
[1:21:50] all right man I knew I didn't have the
[1:21:52] new birth
[1:21:54] but that's all I wanted
[1:21:56] and I packed every word I could get in
[1:21:58] there see because then I knew I had come
[1:22:00] to the words of eternal life amen that's
[1:22:03] right
[1:22:04] brother Brown says the Bible says repent
[1:22:07] everyone up and be baptized in the name
[1:22:08] of Jesus Christ and then you shall he
[1:22:10] said and God's obligated amen when it's
[1:22:13] obligated to everybody that reads that
[1:22:15] and says it all right
[1:22:17] no that's right no way he's obligated to
[1:22:22] the one that sees that and believes it
[1:22:23] in his heart into being real and life
[1:22:25] give
[1:22:26] the word to eternal life all right man
[1:22:29] then it becomes eternal life when God
[1:22:32] quickens it
[1:22:35] oh but brother Dale I believe I come in
[1:22:37] this world with eternal life where'd you
[1:22:38] get it come on I thought it was to come
[1:22:41] through Jesus Christ that's right amen
[1:22:42] and Abraham would have had it
[1:22:45] Motors would have had it no
[1:22:49] you see Church
[1:22:52] eternal life is the word Made Alive and
[1:22:55] Jesus had the words of eternal life all
[1:22:57] right
[1:22:58] the whole world of religious forms was
[1:23:01] waiting on the man that could say right
[1:23:05] have the words of eternal life sure
[1:23:10] and somebody could get it after then
[1:23:13] when it was bottled up in one man right
[1:23:16] all right man
[1:23:18] he had to go pay the price amen he could
[1:23:21] plant the seed but he had to pay the
[1:23:23] price
[1:23:24] amen he paid the price that the life
[1:23:26] could come back on the scene but he had
[1:23:28] the words of eternal life to lay out
[1:23:30] into them that's why Peter goes on to
[1:23:32] the next verse and said Thou Art the
[1:23:34] Christ all right amen mind because it
[1:23:37] was quick and unintuitive right right
[1:23:39] amen it could be quicker than to you
[1:23:42] you can get a revelation without being
[1:23:44] born again
[1:23:47] but it's only for the time that didn't
[1:23:50] give Peter eternal life
[1:23:53] he had to go to Pentecost right Amen
[1:23:55] brother run said it was phased for the
[1:23:57] time talking about the little woman you
[1:23:59] know face for the time you can have
[1:24:01] faith for the time Abraham did one of
[1:24:03] these days I don't want to preach them
[1:24:04] or something come on music you know I
[1:24:06] told sister trivia I'm going to preach
[1:24:07] one of these days what brought around
[1:24:08] made a statement it's always boy with me
[1:24:11] he said to discernment you see
[1:24:14] you know everybody wants to make it some
[1:24:16] kind of a fiction of his mouth some kind
[1:24:17] of or something some kind of a doing
[1:24:20] you know what he said it was
[1:24:27] he said it was a revelation
[1:24:32] brother Brown said
[1:24:34] it was a revelation amen
[1:24:39] God revealed it back to him no only
[1:24:42] South Asians he didn't see Visions
[1:24:44] Jesus didn't see visions
[1:24:49] I do nothing till the father shows me
[1:24:51] brother when I said he saw a vision all
[1:24:52] right then we'd like to die if he didn't
[1:24:53] do nothing to see the vision no that
[1:24:55] wouldn't I
[1:24:58] a lot of things happened that he didn't
[1:25:00] see an open Vision like this right he
[1:25:02] saw vision from inside again right right
[1:25:05] that's why I wrote around and said
[1:25:06] nobody can argue
[1:25:09] about this and I'm telling you now
[1:25:12] he said because he's revealed amen
[1:25:19] the Bible says without a vision you
[1:25:21] perish I mean here's the invasion
[1:25:24] some of you have but everybody in here
[1:25:27] can't raise your hand and say they've
[1:25:28] seen a vision right right so you're
[1:25:30] perished
[1:25:31] that's where everybody preaches it ain't
[1:25:32] it
[1:25:33] no if you've seen a revelation
[1:25:36] you've got a revelation of one true
[1:25:39] believing God that was a vision not to
[1:25:41] see it out there
[1:25:43] amen but Ephesians inside of you
[1:25:46] the words of eternal life amen
[1:25:49] hallelujah let's come to an individual
[1:25:52] man right now you can have a new
[1:25:54] testament
[1:25:56] you can't go from where we was in the
[1:25:58] Old Testament to the new without having
[1:25:59] the words of eternal life standing right
[1:26:02] there
[1:26:04] with the ability to give his life must
[1:26:06] stand look at he could give his life and
[1:26:09] when he could give his life then he
[1:26:10] could bring eternal life to you and I
[1:26:12] that's right
[1:26:13] the words of eternal life
[1:26:19] they argue about Jesus and they say part
[1:26:21] of his word was read my part it was
[1:26:22] logos I don't have enough sense to argue
[1:26:24] about that I just believe what he said
[1:26:27] he said one day he said my words your
[1:26:29] spirit in their life amen when he said
[1:26:31] Harry that old Fox
[1:26:35] you're going to say that with God
[1:26:38] come on
[1:26:39] you're gonna said it wouldn't God
[1:26:41] talking so you don't want to say one
[1:26:42] time I was a man that brought around
[1:26:43] God speaking one down in my hands feet
[1:26:46] booing the man speaking who was he
[1:26:50] that's right you see what I'm talking
[1:26:53] about the words of eternal life
[1:26:59] a man
[1:27:00] standing on Earth 2 000 years ago
[1:27:04] right into you and I the words of
[1:27:07] eternal life
[1:27:09] that's right
[1:27:11] no wonder this man could withstand in
[1:27:14] life's days and talk about a third pool
[1:27:20] yep
[1:27:22] where he was challenged to speak the
[1:27:26] word he said not what is written
[1:27:31] that's right
[1:27:34] he spoke the word
[1:27:37] because he had it within his possession
