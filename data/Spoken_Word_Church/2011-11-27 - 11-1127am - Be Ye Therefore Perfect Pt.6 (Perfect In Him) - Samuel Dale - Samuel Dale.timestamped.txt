[14:08] let you help that away if you want to do
[14:10] that okay all right
[14:12] Matthew
[14:15] 5:37 but let your conversation be yay
[14:18] yay nay nay for whatsoever is more than
[14:21] these cometh of evil you have heard that
[14:24] it ha been said an eye for an eye and a
[14:26] tooth for a tooth but I say unto you
[14:28] that you resist not evil but whosoever
[14:32] shall smite thee on the right cheek turn
[14:34] to him the other also and if any man
[14:37] will sue thee at the law and take away
[14:39] thy coat let him have thy cloak also and
[14:44] whosoever shall compel thee to go mile
[14:46] go with him Twain give to him that
[14:49] asketh thee and from him that would Bor
[14:52] of thee turn not thou
[14:54] away now remember the background behind
[14:56] this is the Beatitudes right
[14:59] blessed is he that this blessed is he
[15:01] that this blessed is he that this now
[15:03] you've turned to the what would be
[15:05] called a similitude or another words
[15:07] God's life he's explaining what he's his
[15:11] way of doing things all right the other
[15:13] was blessings now it's explaining his
[15:16] way of doing things that we ought to
[15:18] want to do and to follow after him all
[15:22] right you have heard that it has been
[15:24] said Thou shalt love thy neighbor and
[15:26] hate thine
[15:27] enemy
[15:29] but I say unto you love your enemies
[15:31] bless them that curse you do good to
[15:33] them that hate you and pray for them
[15:35] which despitefully use you and persecute
[15:38] you that you may be the children of your
[15:40] father which is in heaven for he maketh
[15:42] the son to rise on the evil and on the
[15:45] good and send us reain on the just and
[15:48] the unjust for if we love them which
[15:50] love for if you love them which love you
[15:54] what reward have you do not even the
[15:56] publicans the same M and if you salute
[15:58] your brethren only what do you more than
[16:02] others do not even the Publican Soul be
[16:06] therefore perfect even as your father
[16:08] which is in heaven is perfect other
[16:11] words if we don't follow that lineup
[16:13] that he's giving of what we're reading
[16:15] then let's don't claim
[16:17] Perfection right or being perfect okay
[16:20] now we go to Colossians
[16:23] 1 we'll start reading verse
[16:27] 26
[16:29] even the mystery which hath been hid
[16:30] from the ages and generation but now is
[16:32] made manifest to his Saints to whom God
[16:34] would make known what is the riches of
[16:36] the glory of this mystery among the
[16:39] Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope
[16:41] of glory whom we preach warning every
[16:44] man and teaching every man in all wisdom
[16:47] that you may that we may present every
[16:51] man perfect in Christ Jesus you may be
[16:56] seated the Lord add his Blessing to the
[16:58] reading of the word now I chose to give
[17:01] you the quotes this morning to go along
[17:04] with the
[17:05] reading
[17:07] because that way you can go home
[17:10] and you know read them and study these
[17:14] things and remember the background now I
[17:18] I didn't I told him not to place it
[17:20] within this series but of you know we
[17:25] were talking be therefore perfect where
[17:27] Jesus said it there Matthew
[17:29] 5:48 and a lot of people has argued with
[17:32] that you know that means this that means
[17:34] that that means that didn't mean this
[17:35] didn't mean that well what are you
[17:37] worried
[17:38] about it means just what it
[17:40] said whatever you want to clarify it to
[17:43] be it means just what it says be
[17:45] therefore perfect even as your father in
[17:47] Heaven is perfect all right you say well
[17:49] it's impossible for a human being to be
[17:51] that I agree with
[17:53] you but now God required it so now what
[17:56] are you going to do whether you and I
[17:59] can argue or fuss over what what words
[18:01] mean is one thing but when God requires
[18:06] something it must be
[18:09] met and if it's not met then where are
[18:14] we see we can try to make this make
[18:17] excuses excuses won't be no good it
[18:20] takes the word and that's why I place in
[18:22] between
[18:23] here thought this past Wednesday of
[18:26] talking about how
[18:29] that God's word says
[18:32] it and if God says it in his word that's
[18:36] his promise amen we can take him at his
[18:39] word we can believe what he
[18:42] said and he will make it
[18:45] manifest because he's God all right now
[18:49] so let's get on back now to our thought
[18:51] that remember what we were covering
[18:54] before we left to go to Kansas hunting
[18:56] and we had a real good time out there
[18:57] with the with the brothers and sisters
[19:00] in the wit church and also in the
[19:03] Bartlesville Church bville Oklahoma and
[19:06] preaching for them and W preaching for
[19:08] them really really had a good time we
[19:10] had a good time hunting more less
[19:11] relaxed and and everything a little bit
[19:14] and I shot me a deer early and decided
[19:17] to take a few days off you know
[19:20] and relax a little so I was able to
[19:23] listen to tapes and walk and pray and do
[19:26] everything I wanted to do you know and
[19:28] that's a rare occasion for me so you
[19:31] know I didn't get much of a deer but I
[19:34] did go back and get some pictures then
[19:36] wait trying to find a one to get the
[19:37] pictures of you know so we had fun it
[19:40] was all right amen all those Saints out
[19:43] there send their love unto you but now
[19:45] remember what we were talking
[19:49] about they said we've been on the topic
[19:51] or titled be therefore
[19:54] Perfect all right now if God required
[19:59] that to be and that's what he
[20:02] said he didn't say maybe you can
[20:05] hopefully you can or whatever you can
[20:07] well there we're all just human we can't
[20:09] be perfect I agree with you no problems
[20:13] right but when God requires
[20:16] something he must make a way that's
[20:19] right for that to be fulfilled right now
[20:22] he didn't have any trouble as we've
[20:24] covered with you he didn't have any
[20:26] trouble in in Genesis 6 there verse 9
[20:30] saying that Noah was perfect
[20:33] right I didn't have any trouble with
[20:35] saying that he didn't have any trouble
[20:38] there when we were talking about Job 1
[20:40] which he actually does it three times in
[20:42] the Book of
[20:43] Job he said job was
[20:45] perfect amen he didn't have any trouble
[20:48] with saying
[20:50] it well no that's exactly what the three
[20:55] guys that came you know were job's
[20:57] comforters
[20:58] condemners instead of
[21:01] comforter they stayed with him probably
[21:03] looked like for days and days trying to
[21:06] as best to tell him he was a secret
[21:09] Sinner and see he kept saying I've made
[21:12] the
[21:15] atonement God said he was
[21:17] perfect he told Abraham there in Genesis
[21:21] 171 said walk before me and be thou
[21:27] perfect now that was into the Old
[21:29] Testament under the blood of Jesus
[21:33] Christ
[21:36] right now what would be the
[21:39] problem if God could say A man was
[21:41] perfect under the blood of of bulls and
[21:44] goats because he made the
[21:48] atonement right he offered what God Said
[21:51] God made a requirement he offered it and
[21:55] God said he was perfect all right now
[21:58] and like I told you every Israelite that
[22:00] took a lamb up throw it down walked off
[22:03] said sacrifice that to me I'll go do
[22:05] what I'm going to do now that wouldn't
[22:06] so I never have believed
[22:09] that now I know the whole covering of
[22:13] the original atonement that was made
[22:15] once a year would cover Israel as a
[22:18] whole as a nation yes I understand that
[22:21] but an individual making a sacrifice if
[22:24] it wasn't sincerity then God didn't
[22:27] accept his sacrifice
[22:28] and you better
[22:30] believe that if Aaron wasn't
[22:34] sincere I don't believe he'd went behind
[22:36] the veil to you when it meant death if
[22:40] he went there without a sincerity so
[22:42] it's not every little person everything
[22:44] that's done it was done on the basis of
[22:46] an honest and a contrite
[22:49] heart right sincerity of the individual
[22:53] and God would forgive the others he
[22:55] didn't have to forgive because they were
[22:57] not sincere
[22:58] all right now what's the difference in
[23:00] that in the blood of Jesus
[23:02] Christ I thought we had to believe that
[23:05] Jesus Christ died in our
[23:09] place but then not just go out and say
[23:11] Well it don't make no difference I just
[23:12] going to live like the devil because
[23:13] once saved always
[23:15] saved well I didn't believe that and I
[23:17] was in the badst I'm just honest where I
[23:20] talk I'm sorry I didn't believe it then
[23:23] don't believe it now I don't believe you
[23:25] go out and live like the devil if you
[23:28] live like the devil that's who you are
[23:30] brother boll's got a good point he said
[23:31] if you see a hole and you see a fox tail
[23:33] sticking out of the hole you know what
[23:35] it's a pretty good sign there a fox in
[23:37] there so if you go out and live like the
[23:39] devil that's a good sign you're the
[23:41] devil then we come up well I just can't
[23:43] help being what I
[23:45] am well maybe we need to do a lot more
[23:47] praying right it certainly is not God's
[23:50] fault well he made me this way no he
[23:53] didn't right amen we made ourselves that
[23:58] way right wasn't him all right so now we
[24:01] talk
[24:02] about what is it to be
[24:07] perfect and if I keep going over this in
[24:09] the message today you forgive me because
[24:11] this is what's on my
[24:13] heart if we don't sincerely
[24:16] believe that Jesus Christ died in our
[24:18] place that's right right then there's no
[24:21] need of talking about perfect imperfect
[24:23] what perfects that's right amen No need
[24:26] no need of talking about anything if you
[24:27] can't believe that Jesus Christ died for
[24:30] you that's right well I believe he died
[24:32] for everybody else like the Israelites
[24:35] would say well I've seen it I've seen
[24:37] him forgive that
[24:39] person but it just probably wouldn't
[24:41] forgiven me well you just don't believe
[24:43] it
[24:45] right God made the way we do what he
[24:49] said we're perfect that's right right
[24:53] see that's what we don't think about see
[24:54] but like I said I seen a sign one day
[24:57] said I'm not perfect but I'm
[25:01] forgiven well now according to my
[25:05] Bible that if God forgives you that's
[25:08] right it is placed into the sea of his
[25:11] forgetfulness
[25:13] never right to be remembered again right
[25:18] that's what I thought the Bible said
[25:21] amen so then you say well it's
[25:23] impossible right it's impossible for you
[25:25] and I can we do wrong every day
[25:28] that's why we must have the atonement
[25:30] right amen even though you have the
[25:33] baptism of the Holy Ghost in your soul
[25:36] they're still in atonement the Bible
[25:38] calls it an advocate right Jesus Christ
[25:41] the
[25:42] righteous who's making intercession Upon
[25:45] My Confession that's right amen so if I
[25:48] say that I'm saved I'm saved if I say
[25:51] that I'm lost what happened right he has
[25:55] to intercede upon what I say that's
[25:57] right if you said in the Old Testament
[25:59] you didn't believe that business about
[26:00] the lamb it didn't do you any good
[26:03] that's right but if you believed
[26:06] it he could take your
[26:08] place all right so now what are we
[26:11] basing
[26:12] upon now with that behind us to the
[26:15] point of what we've been trying to bring
[26:16] out you remember the last message I
[26:19] preached I asked the
[26:22] question I said what is the
[26:25] difference in the word perfect
[26:31] or the word
[26:35] Perfection now what's the difference in
[26:37] saying perfect or
[26:42] Perfection I'll let you think on that a
[26:47] while as I said even to the Old
[26:50] Testament people under the blood of
[26:51] Jesus Christ he would call him Perfect
[26:55] Right bam tried his best to curse Israel
[26:59] remember and God
[27:01] says I don't see
[27:05] it bam come back to B every which way it
[27:08] goes there and he
[27:11] says right I think curse
[27:14] him he said look at the hinder the worst
[27:17] part I can't see it right because God
[27:21] wouldn't let him see it right
[27:23] right he was a prophet even though he
[27:26] was false
[27:28] what he said is written in this Bible
[27:32] right Bam's prophecy right is written in
[27:36] the word of
[27:38] God but yet he couldn't curse Israel
[27:41] because he couldn't see the atonement
[27:43] that was made amen he could see what
[27:45] they were doing and couldn't comprehend
[27:48] why God wouldn't condem
[27:51] them but
[27:53] yet when he was looking at it he
[27:55] couldn't see what they were doing cuz he
[27:56] couldn't curse
[27:59] right
[28:00] now if they were that why are we
[28:03] concerned with about it
[28:05] today and even I showed you in the
[28:07] messages prior or tried to show you on
[28:10] the
[28:11] point that the word used for perfect in
[28:15] the Old
[28:17] Testament for
[28:19] Noah is the same word used in the New
[28:23] Testament which is a
[28:25] rarity because most of the time you will
[28:27] change between the old and the new right
[28:30] but the word perfect in the Old
[28:31] Testament holds the basic meaning of
[28:34] being complete a full age
[28:41] mature all right see then when you turn
[28:44] over to the New Testament of of Matthew
[28:46] 5:48 that we read you'll find there and
[28:50] we'll use some of them this afternoon
[28:52] you'll find there that that word is of
[28:55] the same basic meaning amen
[28:58] complete
[29:00] perfect bringing something to an
[29:06] end all right
[29:09] now so let's think about
[29:12] it if God said you make the
[29:18] atonement I'll take care of the
[29:22] situation yep as long as you meet the
[29:24] requirement with an honest and a sincere
[29:26] heart right emphasize that right
[29:30] right honest and a sincere heart make
[29:33] the atonement God took care of it right
[29:36] amen pushed all of that sin to Calvary
[29:40] where Christ could die once for all amen
[29:42] all right
[29:45] now why would we have any
[29:48] trouble believing
[29:52] it that under the New Testament form as
[29:55] we would call it or under the baptism of
[29:58] the Holy Ghost living in
[30:01] us why would we have
[30:05] trouble with saying that we're
[30:09] perfect see like I said we read a sign
[30:11] and said I'm not perfect I'm just
[30:16] forgiven the devil looks at you
[30:20] last y preachers look at that in
[30:24] glory I never thought of that
[30:29] well I never thought of that way you
[30:31] know why cuz if you're
[30:34] forgiven how can you use any word there
[30:37] that can be applied to you exactly
[30:40] amen right right that's right if you're
[30:44] forgiven right God can never remember
[30:47] anything you put under the blood than
[30:50] you know that even you're Prophet would
[30:51] stand there with discernment that's
[30:53] right and he couldn't bring out from
[30:54] under the blood something you'd put
[30:56] under the blood and tell tell that
[30:57] person about their lives that something
[30:59] had been put under the blood now that's
[31:00] the way he said it
[31:02] amen he said it was so covered it could
[31:04] not be brought out
[31:09] right why would we worry about
[31:12] it but you see that Old Testament person
[31:15] had to have
[31:17] faith that's it a revelation from God
[31:21] yes to his
[31:24] heart that he was forgiven
[31:28] and he went out and with a sincere heart
[31:30] and a humbleness thanking God for the
[31:36] Forgiveness y why would we even think
[31:39] about
[31:42] it if we believe we have the baptism of
[31:45] the Holy
[31:46] Ghost the new birth whatever you want to
[31:49] call
[31:51] it then how could sin be imputed to that
[31:55] new birth
[32:01] are you going to make God a sinner right
[32:05] Yen right right now I'm talking about
[32:08] the soul of the individual our human
[32:10] bodies we still have problems in our
[32:12] spirit we still have
[32:14] troubles but in the soul of an
[32:16] individual that is born again that is a
[32:19] higher state than the Old Testament
[32:20] Saint because the Old Testament Saint
[32:23] could not have the new birth right right
[32:25] amen that's right but if his faith in
[32:29] believing what God said to do and he
[32:31] went and done
[32:33] it with a sincere
[32:35] heart if that would make him perfect
[32:38] what about the blood of Jesus Christ
[32:40] that's right amen but see then we try to
[32:43] figure out all the words well it really
[32:45] means this it really means
[32:51] that we try to to satisfy our
[32:55] ego by
[32:58] bring some kind of a
[33:00] way and the people just sat there well
[33:02] I've never seen that that word perfect
[33:06] means
[33:09] complete well I'm going to ask you this
[33:11] over and over and over through that
[33:13] message
[33:16] today can you add anything to
[33:21] perfect
[33:25] right I just say again
[33:28] is there anything that can be added to
[33:33] perfect if there is it's not perfect
[33:36] that's
[33:38] right simple everybody said brother they
[33:41] preaching so deep we don't understand no
[33:43] I talk so simple until your brain won't
[33:45] comprehend what I'm talking about it
[33:47] takes a new birth right
[33:54] right but can anything be added to
[34:01] perfect but now we'll see this afternoon
[34:04] more that perfect can be added to
[34:07] Perfect Right amen that's right right if
[34:12] it's a same source which statue of
[34:14] perfect man you get to it we eventually
[34:16] we get
[34:17] there add to your faith bir knowledge
[34:20] God Etc
[34:23] right perfect can be added to perfect
[34:25] but it's got to be of the same s
[34:27] that's
[34:28] right right amen all right so I know
[34:33] I've been through these but I want to go
[34:34] back through
[34:35] them I want to make sure you understand
[34:38] what I'm
[34:40] saying it's up to God to reveal it to
[34:43] you see in God's eyes a perfect a person
[34:48] in God's eyes now that's what I'm saying
[34:51] job read the book of Job he had three
[34:53] guys that came and spent a whole time
[34:55] with him days condemning him condemning
[34:57] him condemning him saying he was a
[34:59] sinner he kept saying I made the
[35:01] atonement I've done what God required
[35:05] amen what else can I do well you're a
[35:07] secret
[35:12] sinner but
[35:15] listen in God's eyes job was perfect
[35:19] that's right that's right yes sir and
[35:21] you know
[35:22] what I don't give a hoot what anybody
[35:25] else thinks about
[35:27] right is that blunt enough whether it be
[35:30] the devil or
[35:32] you I don't care you think job cared
[35:36] what his comforter
[35:41] said the fourth man which was El you
[35:43] which is type of Christ come and he said
[35:45] now job you're right in what you said
[35:46] you offered your at but said you're just
[35:48] a tad bit self-righteous now that's the
[35:50] way you're Prophet had to say about job
[35:52] he said you're a tad bit
[35:55] self-righteous but said you're right
[35:57] what you said y see in God's eyes when
[35:59] they made that atonement God's eyes was
[36:02] cut off because the bumper blood of the
[36:05] Lamb was placed over the people y right
[36:11] all right now if we can have that much
[36:13] Faith as it said a moment ago in that
[36:15] blood of a blood of bulls and goat being
[36:17] a bumper what about the blood of Jesus
[36:19] Christ right
[36:22] amen until your Prophet would say there
[36:24] is no such thing as a sinner today
[36:28] he said well the world's full of them
[36:30] God don't see him
[36:34] right he can't see it cuz he have to
[36:36] kill a person that's right am that
[36:40] sensible so he doesn't see it because of
[36:42] the blood atonement that he
[36:47] made now in God's eyes see then you can
[36:51] be perfect
[36:53] right but everybody else remembers and
[36:56] you do too I do too we remember what we
[37:01] done and see we still start dealing with
[37:05] what we doing what we doing cuz that's
[37:08] what the devil keeps bringing
[37:10] up like I always tell you the Devil
[37:14] comes to tell you what you're
[37:16] done or even what you're
[37:19] doing NE way just remind of him of
[37:23] what's going to happen to
[37:25] him
[37:27] right right you tell him what's going to
[37:29] happen to
[37:31] himen you know what I don't mind telling
[37:33] him like this the devil I may die and go
[37:35] to hell with you but Bud you got
[37:38] problem because you're one a day going
[37:40] to be
[37:44] annihilated I don't mind talking like
[37:46] that to
[37:47] it remind him of what he's going to get
[37:50] that's right amen but see there's never
[37:52] been anybody perfect it's got to be in
[37:54] the eyes of the one who SE SE it right I
[37:58] was thinking the other day about it on
[37:59] the Statue of perfect man a little bit
[38:01] and it's just I know I think carnal I'm
[38:04] sorry but sometimes they're pretty good
[38:06] thoughts I like them but what I was
[38:08] thinking about you know that a
[38:12] child a
[38:15] child You' be the ugliest person in the
[38:19] world and little old baby just loves
[38:22] you
[38:25] right now come on
[38:28] I mean it doesn't matter if you got
[38:29] warts all over your face and Knots all
[38:31] over or whatever you are and no ha no
[38:33] teeth whatever it
[38:35] is and little grandkids would just love
[38:38] Grandma
[38:41] Grandpa you know
[38:44] why cuz they're not looking at what you
[38:47] are out
[38:49] here they're looking at your
[38:53] character children babies can read a
[38:56] char
[38:57] character and us adults only read
[39:01] faces right right we only look at what
[39:04] we see and condemned by what we
[39:09] see and a child you pick it up and spank
[39:12] it in just a few minutes It'll come to
[39:13] hug your
[39:15] neck you spank an adult they run out the
[39:18] door and slam it going out you know yeah
[39:20] right other words leave the church Plain
[39:22] language right you want to be corrected
[39:25] that's right mhm a child looks at
[39:29] character we look at natural things
[39:32] right we got our little feelings hurt
[39:35] and we sour
[39:38] up well one of these days that'll all be
[39:41] over with we have to worry about it it
[39:44] won't be no soured up in heaven that's
[39:46] right and I was thinking yesterday there
[39:48] won't be no coffee pots Brother Don
[39:50] won't be making us no coffee in heaven
[39:52] he used to come here and make the coffee
[39:54] for us and have it ready on Sunday
[39:55] morning
[39:57] you know we all laugh about it he ain't
[39:59] going to make us no coffee CU ain't
[40:01] going to be no coffee pots in heaven you
[40:03] ain't going to need no kick up there to
[40:05] get rid of your morning hangover
[40:07] headaches and stuff it just won't be
[40:09] there all right maybe we won't be there
[40:12] but all right now let's review a little
[40:17] bit and I know you'll say well you just
[40:20] go hatching over this well I'm hatching
[40:21] over it for a purpose amen because now
[40:24] this morning I'm trying to get the
[40:26] defition to you of
[40:28] perfect this afternoon we'll get the
[40:30] definition of
[40:32] perfection all
[40:35] right see then we'll see what it what
[40:38] what the the wording means all right now
[40:42] let's read a few the prophet had to say
[40:43] and I just gave them to you like I said
[40:45] you can take them back home most of
[40:46] these you've already had them but let's
[40:48] go back over them okay go ahead brother
[40:51] Joe with number one on the Lamb's Book
[40:53] of Life paragraph e35
[40:57] and I give you these cuz I want you to
[40:59] know what your Prophet had to say andan
[41:01] I can get up here and run off a run you
[41:03] know boy bless God he told us what the
[41:06] prophet said and I might not have told
[41:07] you a thing he said so I like to read it
[41:10] to you then you can't argue with
[41:13] me I like to read you the Bible you
[41:15] can't argue with the Bible
[41:17] That's so let's just look at it you know
[41:20] how we do it a lot of times we don't
[41:22] read the whole thing CU you go back and
[41:24] read the whole part he's talking about
[41:27] how under the worshipper of the Old
[41:28] Testament came up under a shadow and all
[41:31] and watch could never be made
[41:34] perfect M he said well you just got
[41:37] through saying that all them people was
[41:42] perfect the prophet just said they could
[41:45] never be perfect they could never come
[41:47] to
[41:50] completion so you going to have to break
[41:52] down the word perfect this morning
[41:55] right
[41:57] now for years in the denominations you
[42:00] used it as saying that that word perfect
[42:03] in Matthew 5:48 does not mean a perfect
[42:07] life it means a growth
[42:11] development well if you don't have a
[42:14] perfect life as to perfect in Christ
[42:18] there cannot be a growth
[42:20] development is that straight enough
[42:23] right so now we're going to have to
[42:25] erase all all of our old
[42:27] thinking and it won't be done this
[42:29] morning I'll have to repeat it 50 times
[42:31] for it to be raised for most of you you
[42:34] know why cuz it has to be to me
[42:37] too well I don't understand what you're
[42:39] talking
[42:40] about now you don't want to understand
[42:42] what I'm talking
[42:45] about see what we thought the word meant
[42:48] we swore by it right right we swore by
[42:52] the Trinity it was in the
[42:54] Bible we swore by eternal hell it was in
[42:59] the
[43:01] Bible we swore that there's nobody
[43:03] perfect in the
[43:08] Bible see now we're going to have to lay
[43:10] down all that junk right right and I
[43:14] call it junk because it's what it
[43:17] is it's what we used to think cuz the
[43:21] Bible don't teach no Trinity no right
[43:24] amen teaches one true and living God
[43:27] am and not just God in three person
[43:29] Blessed Trinity that's Catholic Church
[43:31] as much as three literal gods or
[43:33] whatever you want to do with it that's
[43:35] right the Bible don't teach an eternal
[43:38] hell cuz it did then everybody would
[43:40] have to have eternal life to go to hell
[43:42] and live in hell eternally then that
[43:44] would be God's life in hell so that
[43:46] solves that problem right
[43:49] right you see where those
[43:51] doctrines we swore
[43:55] by
[43:56] you know what it took a long time to
[43:58] beat it out of us that's
[44:01] right now maybe we got some more that
[44:03] we've adopted on our own that we need to
[44:05] be beat out
[44:07] ofs well you ain't a preacher like these
[44:09] other preachers I like you to get up
[44:10] there and go with it but yeah when you
[44:12] get to you don't know what in the world
[44:13] of man say it right I'm not against that
[44:15] type of
[44:16] preaching right I'm just
[44:20] me first of years coming up what you
[44:22] another Pastor I'm just me
[44:27] see because I want you to see what the
[44:30] prophet said right then you can make
[44:32] your choice the Bible says you make a
[44:36] choice right well brother D I believe
[44:38] I'm perfect how do you believe you're
[44:40] perfect by being in Jesus Christ amen
[44:43] that's right amen but is that a
[44:45] revelation or a quote
[44:47] right which one is
[44:54] it do you know know that by being in
[44:56] Jesus Christ you're just as righteous as
[44:58] God is the Bible say but do we really
[45:00] believe that that's
[45:04] right do we really believe that right is
[45:07] that a revelation or
[45:09] quote quot kill Revelation set you free
[45:13] I thought that's what Paul said when he
[45:15] said the letter kill it y but the spirit
[45:18] gives
[45:20] life do we really believe that brother
[45:23] randam was the prophet sent from God
[45:26] right amen and what he said did not
[45:30] change the
[45:32] Bible cuz he'd be a false prophet if he
[45:34] changed the Bible we don't believe that
[45:35] amen that's right we don't believe
[45:37] brother around was God we don't believe
[45:39] none of the junk it's around Dimension
[45:41] that's
[45:42] right but we believe God according to
[45:44] Malachi 4 Luke 17:30 Revelations 10:7
[45:47] and all those scriptures was to send in
[45:49] the end time a prophet
[45:52] Amen to speak to
[45:54] us the word not to interpret the word as
[45:59] saying that don't really mean that that
[46:01] means this it didn't he said it means
[46:04] exactly what it
[46:06] said but see our carnal mind has
[46:09] interpreted it so long to us right by
[46:12] mankind teaching our minds until we
[46:14] wound up self-interpreting the word
[46:17] putting our own thoughts to the
[46:20] word and it don't matter what anybody
[46:24] says that's what the pH with us when
[46:26] Jesus right you know that they could
[46:28] tell you they could take a scroll they
[46:30] say and roll it up and put a pen through
[46:32] you and they could tell whatever the
[46:33] letter it went that pen would go through
[46:36] because they read it so much but when
[46:37] the god of the word stood before them
[46:39] what did they do they crucified him
[46:42] that's right come on is that
[46:45] right right when he said before Abraham
[46:48] was I well you ain't even 50 years old
[46:50] yeah that's
[46:53] what Moses is our prophet he said Moses
[46:57] wrote a man amen that's right you think
[47:00] they believe that
[47:03] no but see Church let's just settle down
[47:05] and and think about what is being said
[47:08] to us yes
[47:11] Lord what does it mean to be
[47:19] perfect what does that word mean to
[47:24] you when perfect you cannot add anything
[47:28] to perfect that's right if you do it's
[47:31] not
[47:35] perfect see then you must add perfect to
[47:40] perfect see that's why we read that
[47:42] there where in Matthew where it says let
[47:44] your words be yay yay and nay nay called
[47:49] anything else beside that is
[47:52] what sin right
[47:56] well I think it means that's exactly
[47:58] what he
[48:00] said that's what got this thing
[48:02] started right well I don't have to
[48:05] depend on you you don't have to depend
[48:06] on
[48:08] nothing but you got to depend on God
[48:10] Amen and if God send us away you better
[48:13] follow the way if you don't then forget
[48:18] it if I was going to believe this
[48:20] prophet's message I'd just go join some
[48:21] of these Cults and forget it that's
[48:25] right come they be just good of one with
[48:27] the other
[48:28] one right as some of these brothers
[48:31] about this LOD you can go to and they'll
[48:34] take the lay out the statue of a perfect
[48:36] man that on the floor and teach you the
[48:40] seven steps of their staircase lecture
[48:45] right and if you don't qualify you don't
[48:49] move up the ranks is that right
[48:53] Brothers you don't move up the ranks
[48:57] do you qualify
[48:59] right
[49:01] well what about
[49:04] us listen what your Prophet
[49:10] said
[49:11] see the reason he said that and the
[49:14] scripture says that the worshipper could
[49:16] not be made perfect on the Old Testament
[49:18] why because there was no new
[49:20] birth right right he could be perfect in
[49:24] God's eyes cuz he was covered
[49:26] but there was no new birth to bring him
[49:27] to the position God wanted him at right
[49:30] right so he couldn't come to that back
[49:32] there see he had to wait until Jesus
[49:34] Christ came right haven't you heard many
[49:36] times the people say oh there's none
[49:39] perfect that's right you can't be the
[49:43] perfect in the S of your fellow men but
[49:45] you got to be perfect or you'll never go
[49:48] to
[49:49] heaven that's
[49:52] right come on the Bible said Jesus
[49:55] speaking in beatitude Matthew said be
[49:57] therefore perfect even as your father in
[49:58] Heaven is perfect then you got to be
[50:01] just as perfect as God
[50:04] is or you're
[50:06] lost
[50:09] amen now how are you going to do it see
[50:13] now one little mistake and you're lost
[50:16] one little flap of the eye and you're
[50:20] gone cuz nothing can enter in to those
[50:24] places
[50:26] but
[50:27] perfect now how are you going to do it
[50:30] you got to be perfect to go to
[50:34] heaven they started the doctrine years
[50:37] ago and that's what run us out of a
[50:38] church that you had to come up here to
[50:40] the top of this pyramid to be able to
[50:42] have the Holy
[50:44] Ghost and uh I said well how can you do
[50:47] that when the prophet preaches you got
[50:49] to be born again at Faith and you
[50:51] receive eternal
[50:53] life yeah but that ain't right
[50:56] I okay go believe
[50:59] it now watch look at the next one the
[51:02] Queen of
[51:03] Sheba paragraph
[51:07] E10 and there's only two faculties that
[51:10] can govern
[51:12] you that's either Faith or
[51:16] unbelief you cannot be halfway between
[51:20] there's no black white bird birds are
[51:23] drunk sober men
[51:26] sin or Saints you're either a Believer
[51:29] or not a
[51:30] Believer and the only sin that there is
[51:33] is
[51:36] unbelief now stop and explain
[51:40] something when you repent of your sins
[51:42] and you get them chopped off that does
[51:44] not give you eternal
[51:47] life that only makes you perfect from
[51:50] what you done right cuz it's gone y it
[51:54] don't make you perfect right you got to
[51:56] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[51:57] the new birth Amen to qualify to have
[52:00] eternal life amen okay
[52:03] right so what's the prophet
[52:06] saying you're believing unto salvation
[52:09] but you don't possess salvation so in
[52:11] God's eyes you don't possess it no how
[52:14] good no matter how good your life is you
[52:15] know people will be given eternal life
[52:17] one day because of the Deeds Done in
[52:19] their bodies and things like that
[52:21] foolish virgins Etc y but you know they
[52:23] have to be given eternal life
[52:26] cuz they do not have eternal life that's
[52:28] right
[52:30] am so then the prophets right they still
[52:33] right in with the
[52:37] scriptures you can't be a black bird or
[52:39] you know and a white
[52:41] bird right you got to be one or the
[52:45] other right now if you got to be that
[52:48] then God has to you know required it and
[52:51] then we'll go on down and read some
[52:52] things about how to do that the 10
[52:54] virgins in 144,000 paragraph
[52:59] 37 now you remember we're going to deal
[53:01] on that sharply this morning you're
[53:04] either in that body or out of that body
[53:08] no halfway between it there's no pretty
[53:11] good
[53:13] Christians and there you're either
[53:15] Christian or you're not Christian
[53:18] there's no black white
[53:20] bird no drunk siner no drunk sober
[53:24] man
[53:26] you can't have it you're either a
[53:27] Christian or not a Christian you're
[53:30] either in Christ or out of
[53:36] Christ that's what your Prophet is
[53:39] saying well I believe it this way well
[53:41] then you ain't believing brother Brown
[53:43] was your Prophet then forget it I mean
[53:45] that shows
[53:47] up if I read this told you I didn't
[53:49] believe it I I would be telling you
[53:51] right up front I didn't believe what the
[53:52] prophet said amen but see what he says
[53:55] what the Bible
[53:56] says
[53:58] amen
[54:03] now the six seal paragraph 57 63 323 I
[54:09] forget to give the
[54:11] dates you're talking about you know the
[54:13] churches organizations and the Ops and
[54:15] the things and you remember the whole
[54:17] thing is based on two things and one an
[54:20] antichrist the other one a Christ so now
[54:24] we're either we're of one or the other
[54:28] right will the Antichrist we're either
[54:31] Antichrist or we're Jesus Christ amen
[54:35] that's right there is no gray area in
[54:39] God right no well I'm believing unto and
[54:43] I don't like it you telling me I'm lost
[54:44] that's what a man left here one time
[54:46] because that's what I told him I didn't
[54:48] tell him he's
[54:51] lost I told him a way you acting you're
[54:54] lost right
[54:56] he went on told everybody I said he's
[54:57] lost I didn't never say he's lost I said
[54:59] the way you're acting you're lost you
[55:00] know what the way he's acting want prove
[55:02] what he
[55:03] done that's no
[55:06] problem because I'm not one to be able
[55:08] to tell you whether you're lost or
[55:10] saved God is your judg that's right but
[55:14] hey if we go out and live like the devil
[55:16] then there's one thing for sure we must
[55:17] be the devil cuz God don't live that
[55:20] way true amen all right
[55:25] he said it's still the same thing today
[55:27] there's no Highway
[55:28] Christians there's no drunk sober man no
[55:32] black white birds no no no sinner Saints
[55:36] no you're either a sinner or a saint see
[55:39] there's just no in between you're either
[55:42] born again or you're not born again
[55:44] you're either filled with the Holy
[55:45] Spirit or you're not filled with the
[55:46] Holy Spirit no matter how many
[55:48] Sensations you had if you ain't filled
[55:51] with the Holy Spirit you're not filled
[55:53] with it see and if you had been filled
[55:57] with it your life shows it goes right up
[56:00] to it see nobody has to tell anybody
[56:03] about it they see it see because it's a
[56:09] seal that day on Calvary paragraphs 79
[56:13] 1969
[56:17] 205 and when he died at Calvary he made
[56:19] a way he gave up the spirit the holy
[56:22] spirit that sent it back to the Earth
[56:24] for you and I to live by that's what
[56:28] Calvary means to us to follow him first
[56:31] look into it and see what it did for us
[56:33] and then look what must we do in regards
[56:36] to it what must you and I do well you
[56:39] say well I appreciate that that's fine
[56:41] but you got to accept it and to accept
[56:44] it is to accept his person Christ in
[56:47] your heart right then we are free from
[56:51] sin therefore there's no sin shackles
[56:54] hanging on us at all God just like we
[56:58] had never sinned the perfect sacrifice
[57:01] made us perfect for Jesus said be
[57:04] therefore perfect even as your father in
[57:06] Heaven is perfect then there is no more
[57:08] to be done but we are made perfect in
[57:11] the presence of God right all
[57:17] right now I go back again to remind
[57:22] you if God would say a man under the Old
[57:29] Testament doing from a sincere heart and
[57:33] offering the
[57:35] sacrifices that that person in God's
[57:38] eyes was perfect right y
[57:44] right why would we worry then or be
[57:47] consider or try to figure out some kind
[57:50] of a way to make things work for our
[57:53] benefit when under the blood of Jesus
[57:59] Christ in your
[58:02] soul you're perfectly totally
[58:07] sinless y go God and the devil cannot be
[58:12] in your soul at the same time that's
[58:14] right right so forget it that's right
[58:18] say well I don't I don't I don't like it
[58:19] I've got my that's what's the problem we
[58:21] got our
[58:23] ideas but what is our ideas have to do
[58:25] with what the word of God
[58:28] says well who are you to think you can
[58:30] inter I'm not trying to interpret I'm
[58:31] trying to read
[58:35] it but it don't need to be
[58:38] interpreted God is the only interpreter
[58:40] of the word
[58:43] right L 45 Christ Ministry God reveal
[58:45] I'm pretty sure you'll
[58:47] find the Holy Ghost is the only
[58:50] interpreter brother brand wasn't an
[58:52] interpreter right
[58:55] it was a mouthpiece the Holy Spirit used
[58:57] to speak to you and
[59:00] I why can't we get that thing
[59:02] straight he saids then you can tell the
[59:04] difference between the man and the
[59:05] message part of it then you turn around
[59:07] but Brother D I got a quote for the man
[59:09] and the message is the same well that's
[59:11] right brother randman his message was
[59:17] one but brother BR was a human
[59:20] mortal amen that he said he sinned every
[59:23] day and had to have an atonement you
[59:24] argue with him that's right
[59:27] right we go on with
[59:29] it look what he says on the first seal
[59:32] 19
[59:33] 63-18 paragraph
[59:37] 79 he talking about the judgment and the
[59:39] bride don't go through the tribulation
[59:41] and things like that see how can God
[59:44] judge a man that's perfectly totally
[59:46] sinless you say there's no such a person
[59:49] every Born Again believer True Believer
[59:54] you know this his emphasis he's
[59:56] perfectly absolutely sinless before God
[1:00:00] he's not trusting in his
[1:00:02] works in the blood of Jesus that's his
[1:00:05] confessions dropped in see he's not now
[1:00:07] that put that in there correctly because
[1:00:09] you read that with one Junction and
[1:00:11] you'll mess up your mind he's not
[1:00:13] trusting in his Works see it look like
[1:00:15] he say he's not trusting in the blood of
[1:00:16] Jesus Christ he's saying he's not
[1:00:17] trusting in his Works he trusting in the
[1:00:19] blood of Jesus Christ right all
[1:00:22] right the Bible says though he that is
[1:00:25] born of God does not commit sin for he
[1:00:27] cannot sin how can you make a man a
[1:00:29] sinner when the bleach of the blood of
[1:00:31] Jesus Christ is between him and God that
[1:00:34] would scatter sin till there there be
[1:00:36] nothing left of it see how can that pure
[1:00:39] blood of Christ ever let a sin pass
[1:00:42] there he cannot Jesus said be therefore
[1:00:44] perfect even as your father in Heaven is
[1:00:46] perfect and how can you ever start the
[1:00:48] thought of being
[1:00:49] perfect but Jesus required it and if
[1:00:53] Jesus required it he's got to make a way
[1:00:55] for it and he has his own
[1:00:59] blood he's made a way to make us Perfect
[1:01:02] Right amen going on down debate on
[1:01:04] tongues paragraph E10 1960
[1:01:08] 807 there's no black white bird or drunk
[1:01:11] sober man see it's either right or it's
[1:01:14] wrong it it it you can't have error and
[1:01:17] Truth together
[1:01:19] listen you see that's I got my
[1:01:22] ideas I'm going to R
[1:01:25] the Bible don't give you a right to have
[1:01:26] your idea the Constitution
[1:01:29] does but not the Bible and they're fast
[1:01:31] taking away that from the Constitution
[1:01:34] so you know that but the Bible don't
[1:01:36] give you a right to think
[1:01:39] right
[1:01:41] right that's what he done she thought
[1:01:43] she did she messed up it don't give you
[1:01:45] that right see it's either truth or it's
[1:01:49] Error well I heard that brother and he
[1:01:52] was just so close to the truth so
[1:01:56] yeah well since when it's close done any
[1:02:01] good it might work in
[1:02:05] horseshoes but just be careful the last
[1:02:07] guy might ring the ringer cuz he's got
[1:02:09] the truth amen then all your closeness
[1:02:13] is not worth anything right it don't
[1:02:15] matter if it propped up all over the
[1:02:17] post they don't count if the ringer is
[1:02:21] made right amen what it say and you
[1:02:25] believe that don't you brother and
[1:02:28] certainly if if the scripture is right
[1:02:30] then let's say what the script which
[1:02:32] stay with the scripture if the church is
[1:02:35] right then that's what I said to them
[1:02:37] priests I said if the church is right
[1:02:40] stay with the
[1:02:43] church if the church is right stay with
[1:02:45] it if what you believe is right stay
[1:02:48] with
[1:02:50] it
[1:02:52] amen but if the word right let's get
[1:02:54] with the
[1:02:56] word all right let's get a good one the
[1:02:58] Lamb's Book of Life :36 that was :35 we
[1:03:02] go this
[1:03:04] 36 now you got to be perfect Jesus said
[1:03:06] be therefore perfect even as your father
[1:03:08] in Heaven is perfect now how are you
[1:03:10] going to be when you're continually
[1:03:12] sinning when you're continually doing
[1:03:15] what's
[1:03:16] wrong now this will kind of put a little
[1:03:18] kink in the legalist but notice it isn't
[1:03:22] what you do it's what
[1:03:25] God has done it's not what you do it's
[1:03:30] what he done see right you can't be
[1:03:33] perfect you can't be in yourself but in
[1:03:37] Christ you're
[1:03:39] perfected you're not trusting in your
[1:03:41] own good works or your own church you
[1:03:43] belong to but you're trusting in the
[1:03:45] shed blood of the Lord Jesus there you
[1:03:48] are that's what makes you perfect
[1:03:50] there's what anchors your
[1:03:53] faith the let's read all of these and
[1:03:55] then we'll preach a while revelation of
[1:03:58] Jesus Christ which is church age book
[1:04:00] page
[1:04:01] 34 consider this since it is the blood
[1:04:05] of God it is perfect blood and if the
[1:04:07] perfect blood is loosing us from the
[1:04:09] power and bondage and defilement of sin
[1:04:12] then the loosing is perfect and
[1:04:15] complete there is now therefore no
[1:04:17] condemnation he goes reading that
[1:04:20] scripture talk about Del there it is his
[1:04:23] death gave us the blood the blood has
[1:04:26] loosed us there is now no condemnation
[1:04:29] How can there be there is nothing to be
[1:04:31] condemned for because the blood has
[1:04:33] loosed us from sin we are free Guiltless
[1:04:37] don't listen to man listen
[1:04:40] to listen to the
[1:04:43] word you are loosed by the blood that's
[1:04:45] it
[1:04:48] am well now I heard a man say that I can
[1:04:51] just go out and live like the devil now
[1:04:53] it doesn't matter cuz I the New
[1:04:54] Testament now show me that in the Bible
[1:04:57] show me that where your Prophet ever
[1:04:58] said that's show me that where any true
[1:05:01] minister of the Gospel ever said right
[1:05:04] show me where Paul ever said in
[1:05:05] something thing like
[1:05:07] that
[1:05:09] right but you see we still got all that
[1:05:11] we hanging on from back
[1:05:13] dire well I taught all my life brother
[1:05:15] Dale that
[1:05:17] that there was no sin imputed to
[1:05:22] me did it teach you the right way for
[1:05:25] that to be
[1:05:28] right you know that the church has power
[1:05:31] to forgive sin
[1:05:34] right well nowadays they just pass it
[1:05:36] out belief lless and you don't even have
[1:05:37] to come to church you can drive by the
[1:05:38] window get
[1:05:40] you what's the difference than that and
[1:05:42] pay in your what's the word for it is it
[1:05:44] noena what what is that word where you
[1:05:46] just pay for anything no okay and you
[1:05:50] know you can get a pay for Novena you
[1:05:52] can pay for something then go before you
[1:05:54] do
[1:05:55] it
[1:05:57] right you got a Catholic sit make her
[1:05:59] shaking their head you can pay before
[1:06:01] you go do
[1:06:03] it well then when you go do it you don't
[1:06:05] have to repent you don't repented for
[1:06:07] doing it before you done
[1:06:09] it now that never stopped in my brain
[1:06:11] some way some it just kept going I I
[1:06:13] can't figure that out now but that's
[1:06:16] what their priest told them and you know
[1:06:17] what they believe it y that's
[1:06:21] right and they can just go out and kill
[1:06:23] people and just I've done
[1:06:28] forgiven come
[1:06:31] on listen what he says in Hebrews
[1:06:33] chapter 5 and 6 I would ask you if you
[1:06:35] would to read the Hebrews chapter 5 and
[1:06:39] Hebrews chapter 6 of the church I mean
[1:06:41] of the Hebrew Book that the prophet word
[1:06:43] preached I would ask you to read that in
[1:06:45] your Hebrew Book especially for this
[1:06:47] afternoon's
[1:06:50] message Hebrews chapter 5 and 6 part 1
[1:06:54] one paragraph 77 where we'll start
[1:06:57] reading and they say nobody can be
[1:06:58] perfect the Bible said there's none
[1:07:01] perfect and watch nurs your
[1:07:06] contradiction now what's he
[1:07:11] saying he says they're saying that
[1:07:13] nobody can be perfect he said there's
[1:07:14] your
[1:07:16] contradiction and what he explain
[1:07:19] it they're contradictory to the word of
[1:07:21] God cuz the word of God say you can be
[1:07:23] perfect
[1:07:25] that's so they making a contradiction
[1:07:28] when you say that's nonperfect you're
[1:07:29] making a contradiction out of the Bible
[1:07:32] yeah you take your own self
[1:07:33] interpretation and make
[1:07:35] contradiction cuz the Bible said if you
[1:07:38] are born again you're perfectly totally
[1:07:41] sinless that's right
[1:07:44] right well then no matter what I do well
[1:07:46] then that proves you're
[1:07:49] lost so of pra no cist nothing to be
[1:07:52] done no argument right
[1:07:56] go live like the devil we are the
[1:07:58] devil watch what he said you cannot be
[1:08:01] perfect in yourself if you're trusting
[1:08:04] in what you done you're lost be
[1:08:07] therefore perfect even as even just as
[1:08:10] perfect as god is
[1:08:13] perfect now there is one in the Hebrew
[1:08:15] Book where brother Brown said I would
[1:08:16] hate to think that I was born 5 minutes
[1:08:20] ago and had to depend upon something for
[1:08:22] being perfect
[1:08:24] mhm he said because I was born what
[1:08:27] could a five minute old baby do nothing
[1:08:30] but it's a product of sin I was born in
[1:08:33] sin psalmist David said shapen in
[1:08:35] iniquity and ESP spouse my mother's
[1:08:40] wound went forth a liar I'm going to say
[1:08:44] you know have teach them little kids to
[1:08:46] lie they're going to learn it
[1:08:48] yourself cookie in his hand all over his
[1:08:50] mouth you eat the cookie no no no no no
[1:08:52] no
[1:08:54] what about us adults with it slammed all
[1:08:56] over her
[1:08:58] face it don't matter what I do I'm a
[1:09:00] Christian I believe the prophet's
[1:09:03] message you lying
[1:09:06] hypocrite that tough enough that the
[1:09:09] prophet say be glad one of these days
[1:09:11] when he look you straight in the fa and
[1:09:12] say you're not saying what Paul
[1:09:15] said well all right preacher Saint
[1:09:19] whoever we claim to be if we claim that
[1:09:21] we don't sin the Bible says that we sin
[1:09:27] amen the prophet says we sin he said he
[1:09:30] sinned every
[1:09:33] day but he was perfect
[1:09:36] y why because he repented of his sin
[1:09:39] right that's why folks if we sin as a
[1:09:43] Christian we reap a tub fo right do that
[1:09:45] quote why because if we don't confess
[1:09:51] that we're going to have to confess it
[1:09:53] one day day there is a Deeds Done in the
[1:09:56] body whether good or bad that we stand
[1:09:58] before no matter how good a Christian
[1:10:00] you think you are there are two
[1:10:01] judgments in the Bible That's where
[1:10:03] preachers Don't Preach it correctly
[1:10:04] there's a white Throne judgment we sat
[1:10:06] on the throne with him to judge others
[1:10:08] but there's a judgment of the deed done
[1:10:10] in the body whether good or bad then all
[1:10:12] Christians will have to answer that
[1:10:14] judgment but if it's repented of it
[1:10:16] can't come up at that judgment that's
[1:10:18] right that's right
[1:10:20] Amen to those who repent there won't be
[1:10:23] a Jud
[1:10:24] right
[1:10:25] right we're not getting by well nobody
[1:10:28] didn't see it
[1:10:32] do was that what he thought well he said
[1:10:35] I died one day and I ain't died yet cuz
[1:10:37] do slept three
[1:10:42] days we say oh it was thousand years is
[1:10:45] day days okay that's fine but what was
[1:10:48] she
[1:10:50] thinking right brother R said say she
[1:10:53] still thinks she's right right the
[1:10:56] church right right still thinks they're
[1:10:59] right
[1:11:04] right let's go
[1:11:07] on oh getting night dinner's done
[1:11:13] ready I'll finish this afternoon about
[1:11:15] to look what he says the law having a
[1:11:18] shadow e
[1:11:20] 27 the law having a shadow of good
[1:11:22] things to come and not the very image of
[1:11:24] the thing those sacrifices which were
[1:11:26] offered year by year made never made the
[1:11:29] comer unto perfect I want you he didn't
[1:11:33] mind saying those
[1:11:35] things but yet he said it was perfect
[1:11:37] right y if the Bible said it was perfect
[1:11:40] he knew what he's talking
[1:11:43] about those sacrifices never made us the
[1:11:47] new never gave us eternal
[1:11:49] life
[1:11:52] right you can't do
[1:11:56] it just doing the sacrifice can't bring
[1:11:58] you eternal life sacrifice is a
[1:12:02] covering for your
[1:12:05] sins there was no ability for that lamb
[1:12:08] to come back upon them the believer in
[1:12:09] the Old
[1:12:11] Testament see so the prophet still right
[1:12:14] the Bible's
[1:12:16] right so Jesus in Matthew gospel said be
[1:12:20] therefore perfect even as your father in
[1:12:22] Heaven is perfect how are you going to
[1:12:24] do it how can you do it how can you be
[1:12:26] per be as perfect as god is perfect but
[1:12:29] that was a commission or a commandment
[1:12:31] by Jesus Christ to be as perfect as God
[1:12:34] is in heaven perfect there you say who
[1:12:37] can be saved hold it just a
[1:12:40] moment let's find out how that
[1:12:42] Perfection is made now God back there in
[1:12:46] the beginning when he foresaw down
[1:12:48] through the streak of time he knew they
[1:12:51] would have to have a remedy to save the
[1:12:53] those that were that which was Desiring
[1:12:56] to be saved those who hungered hungered
[1:12:58] to be up there in that realm he had to
[1:13:01] make a way to redeem those back
[1:13:05] again he did his own blood right law
[1:13:08] having a shadow PR 77 I hope you see it
[1:13:10] it isn't whether you're good enough to
[1:13:12] be a Christian or not it isn't whether
[1:13:14] you're he was it's whether he was good
[1:13:18] enough now let me read that again so you
[1:13:20] won't miss my wording it isn't whether
[1:13:23] you're good enough good enough to be a
[1:13:25] Christian or not it's whether he was
[1:13:28] good enough if God accepted him and his
[1:13:31] blood makes an atonement God don't see
[1:13:33] you he sees the
[1:13:36] lamb right he goes on to say I don't
[1:13:38] have any
[1:13:41] Perfection you're perfect by the
[1:13:44] vicarious sufferings of Jesus
[1:13:46] Christ now let me just say a few words
[1:13:49] about
[1:13:51] perfect we'll close out in just a minute
[1:13:54] you can't add anything to
[1:13:58] perfect can't be
[1:14:01] right you're perfect you're
[1:14:04] perfect can't add anything to it if you
[1:14:07] did it wouldn't be
[1:14:11] perfect now under the Old Testament you
[1:14:13] had to
[1:14:15] believe that that lamb died in your
[1:14:21] place and that God told
[1:14:25] you now look back in the Old Testament
[1:14:27] for a minute with me you see the
[1:14:29] children of Israel over here in one camp
[1:14:32] and they're taking up the lambs and the
[1:14:34] offerings
[1:14:35] and and they're bowing down before now
[1:14:38] listen but make sure you understand what
[1:14:40] I'm saying so please
[1:14:42] listen they're over here bowing down
[1:14:44] before
[1:14:46] Idols they're over here offering
[1:14:49] sacrifices is that
[1:14:52] true
[1:14:55] come
[1:14:57] on and you got another group of people
[1:14:59] over here and they're bwing down before
[1:15:01] totem poles you
[1:15:04] know or whatever God to
[1:15:08] make and they're in sincerity over
[1:15:11] here just as sincere as that group is
[1:15:13] over there cuz you ever heard the
[1:15:16] prophet say any of you want any of your
[1:15:18] women want to take your baby out and
[1:15:19] feed it to an
[1:15:22] alligator
[1:15:25] but you know a lot of people under those
[1:15:27] idols and worships and things sacrifice
[1:15:29] their children their wives your
[1:15:33] families yeah human sacrifices even
[1:15:36] today are still made to atonements under
[1:15:40] those
[1:15:46] things which one's right right that's it
[1:15:51] sincerity this group over here life and
[1:15:53] cutting up running around goofing off
[1:15:56] you think they were sincere down there
[1:15:57] when Moses came back down off the
[1:15:58] mountain and found them out there just
[1:16:00] dancing and drinking and carousing and
[1:16:03] all kind of adulteries and acts and
[1:16:05] everything taking place and Moses looks
[1:16:08] down at him and
[1:16:10] says God don't block them out if you
[1:16:13] don't block me
[1:16:16] out y That's Right sincerity you say
[1:16:20] sincerity is all it is no it's not you
[1:16:22] want to feed your baby to an alligator
[1:16:24] you want to go throw it down into a
[1:16:26] volcano to get the volcano to stop
[1:16:28] erupting people does
[1:16:30] it which is the sincerity right yes but
[1:16:34] brother they don't know the God we
[1:16:36] know brother R said they bow before an
[1:16:41] idol that they believe that their God
[1:16:45] has entered that Idol yeah and in some
[1:16:48] imaginary way he said they can even he
[1:16:56] voices have you read that much in the
[1:17:00] message that they can actually hear
[1:17:05] voices remember a lady one time she run
[1:17:08] over her husband she backed up run over
[1:17:11] him again asked her why she done it she
[1:17:13] said God told me to do
[1:17:17] it some probably
[1:17:22] did
[1:17:24] but see it's based on sincerity
[1:17:31] folks but it's not based on that form of
[1:17:33] sincerity that's right right it's
[1:17:36] sincerity of an honest
[1:17:38] heart but the truth that goes with that
[1:17:42] because if you're sincere over here what
[1:17:44] does that
[1:17:46] matter but if you've got the truth and
[1:17:49] then got
[1:17:52] sincerity
[1:17:53] you can go before God and offer
[1:17:59] things you remember in the Bible that
[1:18:01] time when the man told him said God you
[1:18:03] able me to Victory or something I won
[1:18:06] and he said I'm going to tell you Lord
[1:18:09] he said when I get back
[1:18:11] home he said the first thing that comes
[1:18:13] out of my house I'll offer it to you as
[1:18:14] a
[1:18:16] sacrifice you know probably what he had
[1:18:18] with a little old dog a lot of times
[1:18:20] back there they had sheep you know and
[1:18:22] different things
[1:18:24] you know that little dog probably run
[1:18:25] out there every time he come
[1:18:28] home or the lamb or the cat or whatever
[1:18:31] it was it was probably the first thing
[1:18:33] he probably had his mindset on that he
[1:18:36] said I love the dog I love the cat I
[1:18:37] love the animal what it is but said when
[1:18:40] it comes out I offer it to you as a
[1:18:42] sacrifice you know the story of what
[1:18:44] happened when he got there his daughter
[1:18:46] came out that's
[1:18:50] right he gave her time of fear for if
[1:18:52] ific ation getting
[1:18:55] ready and then he crucified
[1:18:58] her to keep his
[1:19:03] word don't make promises to God you
[1:19:05] won't
[1:19:07] keep he's going to hold you to your
[1:19:09] promise that's
[1:19:11] right right that's right he's going to
[1:19:14] hold you to your promise that's right
[1:19:16] don't make no deals with it don't tell
[1:19:19] him you do this and I'll do that don't
[1:19:20] make no deals with
[1:19:21] it
[1:19:23] cuz he's going to hold you to
[1:19:25] it that's
[1:19:28] right that's right when never to say
[1:19:31] I'll be at your house
[1:19:32] tomorrow right we're not to say that
[1:19:36] we're to say the Lord willing I will be
[1:19:38] at your house
[1:19:41] tomorrow I'm try to make any deals God
[1:19:44] don't deal but he will demand your word
[1:19:50] right if under the blood of bulls and
[1:19:53] goats they could believe they were
[1:19:56] forgiven and God counted it as David
[1:19:59] said the man who' went out and committed
[1:20:01] adultery and killed his best friend and
[1:20:03] all of these that and the other and then
[1:20:04] he went
[1:20:07] out and when he
[1:20:11] did honest and a contract heart yeah
[1:20:16] right
[1:20:18] right what about
[1:20:20] it what about all all of the
[1:20:26] things what about under the blood of
[1:20:28] Jesus
[1:20:29] Christ have you accepted him to be your
[1:20:32] savior that's good cuz that's what the
[1:20:35] world preaches accepting Jesus Christ
[1:20:38] but your Prophet said his has he ever
[1:20:41] accepted you right
[1:20:44] right he said there's the difference you
[1:20:47] see a world full of people accepting
[1:20:49] Jesus
[1:20:50] Christ right churches all over the world
[1:20:53] more more religious people today more we
[1:20:56] call it Christians today than ever
[1:20:58] before
[1:21:00] y but has God accepted them that's right
[1:21:05] if it's based upon them accepting him
[1:21:08] then all the world has to be
[1:21:10] saved not based on
[1:21:12] that it's based on an honest and a
[1:21:15] sincere heart and whether or not he
[1:21:16] accept you
[1:21:21] right
[1:21:25] why can't
[1:21:27] we and I've always told you I'd rather
[1:21:29] go through
[1:21:30] life believing I've got the baptism of
[1:21:33] the Holy
[1:21:34] Ghost and every day seeking God for the
[1:21:38] baptism of the Holy Ghost and find out
[1:21:40] one day I got it then to go through life
[1:21:43] saying I've got it there ain't nothing
[1:21:45] you can say to me to convince me I don't
[1:21:47] have it well then you don't have it if
[1:21:50] that's what you
[1:21:51] think so you know what I'm saying to
[1:21:56] you I'd rather to go through life
[1:21:58] seeking God and find out I had him than
[1:22:00] go through life not seeking him and find
[1:22:02] out I didn't have him that's right
[1:22:04] because of what I've been told your
[1:22:06] Prophet I read it to you he said don't
[1:22:07] listen to man
[1:22:11] right right he said listen to
[1:22:13] God he said you're
[1:22:16] loosed if you can believe it
[1:22:19] right everything's based upon whether or
[1:22:21] not you believe everything in the Old
[1:22:23] Testament was based on whether or not
[1:22:24] they believed it same as it in the New
[1:22:27] Testament come on brother amen
[1:22:29] everything is based on whether or not we
[1:22:30] can believe
[1:22:31] it that's right did he pay the price
[1:22:36] am did he make the
[1:22:39] atonement and my thoughts is only in one
[1:22:42] thing the
[1:22:46] atonement the atonement was made for
[1:22:49] me it's still
[1:22:51] there
[1:22:54] the body is still lying there is a
[1:22:56] sacrifice on the
[1:23:00] throne what about
[1:23:02] it but do we believe it's for us or for
[1:23:04] somebody
[1:23:07] else right is our faith in a finished
[1:23:11] product of
[1:23:13] Calvary that you cannot humanly prove
[1:23:16] that God ever
[1:23:19] existed that's right you you come over
[1:23:21] here well that's argument of science you
[1:23:24] can't prove that Jesus Christ ever
[1:23:28] existed well man says that's man saying
[1:23:35] it remember the Bible says examine
[1:23:38] yourselves to see whether you're in the
[1:23:40] faith or
[1:23:41] not has he spoken to you well I don't
[1:23:45] believe he speaks to nobody the prophet
[1:23:46] so then they never speak to you cuz you
[1:23:48] just cut him
[1:23:51] off but if you believe that was the
[1:23:53] whole thing of what I tried to bring
[1:23:54] here this past Wednesday
[1:23:56] night the Bible says if you say not if I
[1:24:00] say unto this mountain be
[1:24:02] moved well that was only for brother
[1:24:05] brandom and the Lord Jesus well then we
[1:24:06] might as well all eat drink and be marry
[1:24:09] wa the train pulls
[1:24:15] up I believe somebody's going to catch
[1:24:17] it and speak it yes L Jesus because if
[1:24:20] you're healed you got to say it you're
[1:24:22] saved you got to say it right if you
[1:24:24] change you got to say it
[1:24:29] right but why can't you stand sometimes
[1:24:32] and just say
[1:24:35] things well I don't know where it was
[1:24:36] God or not I stood right here 30
[1:24:39] something years
[1:24:41] ago and I
[1:24:43] said some of the people you think that
[1:24:45] have gone back into the world and are
[1:24:48] lost will before the end comes be back
[1:24:52] in this
[1:24:55] church Amen Brother Don G was the what I
[1:24:58] was talking about that's
[1:25:00] right 15 years ago or so he came back to
[1:25:06] God and started coming to
[1:25:08] church why can't you say it like
[1:25:11] that are you
[1:25:14] afraid see there was another sister I
[1:25:16] had in mind I told my wife who that
[1:25:19] was cuz see if you go ahead and say with
[1:25:21] another sister some of the sister jump
[1:25:23] up and say I'm it yeah no I ain't going
[1:25:25] to tell you a lie about it I told my
[1:25:27] wife who it
[1:25:28] was that would come back before the
[1:25:31] end you say it's
[1:25:35] impossible I believe in a God that does
[1:25:38] all things
