[7:38] you've done for us
[7:40] look where you've brought us look at the

[7:47] coming down to where we are now and then
[7:49] Lord most of all to open your word unto
[7:52] us to bring Salvation to our souls and
[7:56] to deliver your word that we may be able
[7:58] to walk therein we thank you for that
[8:00] and we Praise Your Great Name and ask
[8:03] you to just have your way with us
[8:04] tonight and lead us in Jesus name
[8:08] all right revelation
[8:11] one of these days we're going to get
[8:12] back to Revelation
[8:14] and I turn to see the voice that Spate
[8:17] with me and being turned I saw seven
[8:19] golden candlesticks and in the midst of
[8:21] the seven candlesticks one like unto the
[8:23] son of man clothed with a garment down
[8:26] to the foot and gird about the pouch
[8:28] with a golden girdle all right let's go
[8:31] over now we picked up trying to cover
[8:34] Genesis
[8:37] one and we're going to try to pull
[8:40] together with Genesis 1 and and going
[8:43] into Genesis 2.
[8:46] if we can tonight if you have enough
[8:48] time all right
[8:50] Genesis 1 26 and God said let us make
[8:53] man in our image
[8:56] after our likeness and let them know
[8:58] what's to them and and all that have
[9:01] dominion over the fish of the sea and
[9:03] over the fall of the air and over the
[9:05] cattle and over all of the earth and
[9:07] over ever creeping thing that creepeth
[9:09] upon the Earth
[9:10] so God created man in his own image in
[9:13] the image of God created he him what's
[9:16] now male and female created he them
[9:20] right
[9:22] one being and God blessed them and said
[9:26] unto them be fruitful and multiply and
[9:29] replenish the Earth and subdue it and
[9:31] have dominion over the fish of the sea
[9:33] and all upon the Earth all right now we
[9:36] drop over to 2 7.
[9:39] to try to pull up our point tonight
[9:44] and the Lord God formed Man Out of the
[9:46] Dust to the ground and breathed into his
[9:48] nostrils or Breath of Life
[9:50] and Man became a living soul
[9:54] and the Lord God planted a garden
[9:56] Eastward in Eden and there he put the
[9:59] man whom he had
[10:01] formed all right we'll wait on the other
[10:04] verse 9 or later you may be seated the
[10:06] Lord had his Blessing to the reading of
[10:09] the word
[10:10] now we tried to cover
[10:13] this past Sunday
[10:16] on the
[10:20] creation of man of Genesis 1 26 and 27.
[10:24] and I I pray that that you know I don't
[10:28] want to spend so much time to just
[10:31] trying to pound on something but I want
[10:34] to make sure you understand what I'm
[10:37] saying
[10:38] and then it's up to God to reveal that
[10:40] if it's true if not then he'll show you
[10:43] that it's not true that's no problem and
[10:46] then you can help me with it
[10:49] well what did we find out about this man
[10:52] of Genesis 1 26 and 27. that he was
[10:56] created a
[10:57] spiritual man a spiritual being the
[11:01] prophet called it a supernatural being
[11:03] uh he would call it a theophany he would
[11:06] call it a low gosh he would call it the
[11:09] words bringing it down to connecting all
[11:12] of it together and and bringing it out
[11:15] and showing who this was and then he
[11:18] would bring it down to be the son of God
[11:22] in the image of God well now what is the
[11:25] son of God
[11:29] see we we have been taught back prior to
[11:33] we heard of the message that you know oh
[11:36] yeah your son of God you do this or that
[11:38] or the other maybe if even they knew
[11:40] anything about it
[11:41] but in no way would they try to connect
[11:43] anything back to in the eternities and
[11:47] try to bring it down
[11:49] because we didn't understand
[11:52] but
[11:54] it's not that God created a son
[11:59] the
[12:01] because that's what a lot of people
[12:02] think because they know that Jesus
[12:04] Christ is the creator of John 1 Hebrews
[12:07] 1 Colossians 1 James 2 and 9. you just
[12:10] go on with the scriptures that Jesus
[12:13] Christ is the creator now not Jesus the
[12:16] flesh the flesh was not back there it
[12:19] had a beginning about 2 000 years ago
[12:22] and was be called in the beginning of
[12:25] the creation of God to begin in the
[12:27] wound of a woman all right and we
[12:29] covered how that
[12:31] Adam was God's created son
[12:36] but that Jesus was God's only begotten
[12:39] he said begotten by a woman that's the
[12:42] only time you know that any anyone came
[12:45] forth like he did in the doing even in
[12:48] Adam in his great doings was nothing
[12:50] compared to the Lord Jesus and his
[12:53] coming forth because it would not have
[12:55] been but we're trying to talk about one
[12:57] true and living God
[12:59] all right
[13:01] so then if we're created in the image of
[13:04] God it's not some likeness that you're
[13:07] trying to make or trying to form out and
[13:09] we need to find out what he looked like
[13:11] and oh yeah well we know
[13:13] um maybe he looked like Hoffman well
[13:16] then we need to all look like Hoffman I
[13:18] guess if we're going to be in that image
[13:21] or lightness but it's not exactly that
[13:24] away is it
[13:25] right it's the understanding of one true
[13:28] and living God
[13:29] all right that God never sent a son to
[13:33] die for you and I he came himself right
[13:36] well he never sent a son in the
[13:37] beginning
[13:39] he came himself it was his condescending
[13:42] down to bringing it to us and seeing you
[13:46] know
[13:48] Mankind and what it is and we covered
[13:51] Sunday now and I hope that will stick
[13:53] with you that we covered it in a twofold
[13:56] minor of talking or two-part whatever
[13:59] you want to call it that's not making it
[14:01] too much I don't have that education but
[14:05] uh we covered it that where it says that
[14:09] that it create man in His image and we
[14:11] covered that as the natural human being
[14:14] in the basis of the natural human being
[14:16] all mankind is in that form because
[14:19] there are a little Creator they're this
[14:22] they're that or the other
[14:24] but just remember now
[14:26] this man of 126 and 27 there was a
[14:31] special creation because there's nowhere
[14:34] in the natural of mankind that you can
[14:38] say that a man was made male and female
[14:42] I hope that went soaked into where you
[14:44] can think about it a little
[14:46] there was nothing in the human race that
[14:48] you can talk about male and female
[14:51] I Peggy wouldn't taken out of me
[14:55] I'd make her that much worse
[14:58] but
[15:00] see this man then of 126 and 27
[15:04] would be a different
[15:06] man
[15:09] and I know that I try to lay things out
[15:11] for you to think about and we're trying
[15:13] to comprehend God
[15:16] remember the quote we gave that we can
[15:18] find out about
[15:19] how that God you know what God is we can
[15:22] find out what we are
[15:23] all right if we find out what we are we
[15:25] can find out what God is
[15:27] all right because if we're in the image
[15:30] then we are a an offspring
[15:33] and this man of 126 and 27 is an
[15:37] offspring from God
[15:39] all right
[15:40] it's one person
[15:42] because you can't make it many persons
[15:45] you can make that that one person a
[15:48] multiple form if you want to to try to
[15:51] bring it in to see you know that it
[15:54] would represent all that would receive
[15:57] eternal life and be in The Bride of
[15:59] Jesus Christ would be represented right
[16:01] there in in Genesis 1.
[16:04] all right we went back before the world
[16:07] in the bases that all mankind the
[16:10] prophet says were created in the image
[16:13] of God as because of a Creator but that
[16:16] was in the mind of God
[16:18] all right then he would know what
[16:20] everybody would do he would know
[16:22] whatever person would do and how they
[16:24] would be and and whatever because of in
[16:26] his mind
[16:27] but I've always tried my best to preach
[16:30] to you one thing be careful how you're
[16:33] dealing with your predestinations and
[16:35] your mind
[16:37] because you might just predestinate
[16:40] yourself out of existence
[16:44] right
[16:45] because if you're going to go back to
[16:48] where he was self-existing
[16:52] and he dwelt alone
[16:57] then we certainly wasn't people back
[16:59] there with him
[17:02] because he wouldn't be dwelling alone I
[17:04] try to make those statements where you
[17:06] can think about it like the statement
[17:09] has said that
[17:10] all mankind could be in the image of God
[17:13] as a Creator or something but there's no
[17:16] way that mankind can be male and female
[17:18] within one body
[17:21] but this man was made
[17:23] first spiritual
[17:27] in the image of God
[17:29] that's male and female
[17:32] all right
[17:34] then when Adam was put in flesh
[17:37] you know
[17:39] the flesh man Adam
[17:42] was what
[17:44] male and female
[17:46] right now you can't delay that at the
[17:49] end to just the human race
[17:51] I don't think here what you think you
[17:53] know that you well I think it's this way
[17:55] thank you well that's all right go ahead
[17:56] were you thinking
[17:58] but how are you going to put it there
[18:02] but this one that was created in 126 and
[18:05] 27 was not a creation no more than God
[18:09] was a creation
[18:11] remember we went through all of those
[18:13] things trying to explain what the
[18:15] prophet was saying that God was his
[18:18] first creation and out of God come the
[18:20] logos and out of the logos came to man
[18:24] well where did God begin
[18:29] our word creation signifies a beginning
[18:31] where did he begin
[18:36] so then that's just using terminologies
[18:38] or words
[18:40] to express something that will hide it
[18:43] from the wise and prudent
[18:45] but he where he can reveal it to his
[18:48] children his offspring all right
[18:52] see then that man that was created in
[18:55] 126 and 27
[18:57] is a
[18:59] male and female
[19:02] creation
[19:04] now only God can do that
[19:10] right right
[19:11] only God could bring forth that
[19:15] situation
[19:17] right
[19:19] and then I told you I said and you
[19:22] remember we had it on the drawings and
[19:23] we had the things and we used it a good
[19:25] bit remember what I told you then that
[19:28] brother Branham said that in Adam and
[19:31] Eve
[19:34] was his desire for all
[19:37] of his children
[19:40] right
[19:43] do you know then that you can make that
[19:45] the Christ
[19:48] right your Prophet did he said that was
[19:51] the Christ that was back there or all
[19:54] right the Christ can be male and female
[19:56] now hold that real close with your mind
[19:59] without running and jangling too much
[20:04] the Bible speaks of man and wife
[20:08] and speaks of Christ in the church
[20:12] right
[20:13] all right Christ in the church
[20:16] as man and wife but remember in the body
[20:20] of Christ
[20:23] he is
[20:25] the male
[20:27] and the bride is the female made up of
[20:30] male and female
[20:32] right so it's hard to express it isn't
[20:34] it
[20:35] in the body of Christ is male and female
[20:38] right as human beings but there's only
[20:41] one
[20:42] Holy Ghost
[20:44] and that's not the doctrine that they
[20:46] had in Florida years ago about a male
[20:48] Holy Ghost and a female holy ghost that
[20:52] don't work
[20:53] no
[20:55] just leave it like it is
[20:57] right that is Christ in the church the
[20:59] prophet said
[21:03] all right Christ in the church can be
[21:06] male and female
[21:09] right
[21:11] but you understand what I mean see the
[21:13] the men in the body of Christ are female
[21:16] that can't be done in natural talkings
[21:19] can it
[21:21] you're talking about the bride of Christ
[21:26] and see there in Adam was the perfect
[21:29] example
[21:31] of what God wanted
[21:33] to come out in the end time
[21:36] to where it would be Christ and the
[21:40] church together as one again
[21:46] to bring it back like it was supposed to
[21:48] have been
[21:50] bruh I didn't give this one to him but I
[21:52] told y'all Sunday I'd find it for you
[21:54] because I made a quote listen this is
[21:56] taken from spoken word is Original Seed
[21:58] paragraph 2 16 through 218.
[22:03] and he says well that's the thing same
[22:04] thing from predestination you were
[22:07] supposed to be here right supposed to be
[22:10] here in the right way at the beginning
[22:17] but being that you come the way you did
[22:21] you're subject to the fall but being
[22:24] that you're predestinated you hear the
[22:28] word it brings you right back where you
[22:31] were predestinated
[22:35] he said amen I said never saw that
[22:38] before
[22:39] he caught that right then as a
[22:41] revelation to him brings you right
[22:46] what what makes what makes you believe
[22:48] the word and turn down these other
[22:50] things
[22:51] what makes you believe the word and turn
[22:54] down these other doctrines
[22:57] there has to be some connection but it's
[22:59] not physically or genetically or
[23:02] as we've mankind has tried to make it
[23:05] but what does he say he said you were
[23:08] supposed to be here in the right way at
[23:10] the beginning
[23:13] but remember if it had come that way
[23:16] they would have been no attributes of
[23:19] God displayed right so it didn't come
[23:22] that way
[23:24] all right
[23:25] but then what are we going to do
[23:29] is not the whole story of redemption to
[23:33] take us back
[23:36] to where we should have been in the
[23:37] beginning
[23:39] he sitting on what he's saying
[23:41] to bring us right back to the place to
[23:45] be The Offspring of God
[23:48] well to me that's what he started off in
[23:49] Genesis 1 26 and 27 because that's not
[23:52] the physical man
[23:56] that's the spiritual man
[23:58] right
[24:00] male and female created he them
[24:05] male and female created him the
[24:08] scripture says right
[24:10] this is one person
[24:15] brother Randall called it a theophany
[24:19] he called it the logos
[24:22] we've been through all of these things
[24:24] over he called it the son of God
[24:29] right
[24:31] right then we should consider these
[24:34] things and and not be so jumbled up and
[24:36] try to think about something having the
[24:39] beginning because it's got the word
[24:40] beginning the Earth or creation
[24:48] see get down to the point of seeing
[24:49] Christ and what he wanted to do
[24:54] but he's now doing it through his bride
[25:00] bringing her back to that place
[25:04] we'll get down a little bit to it
[25:08] think about it
[25:11] you remember this quote go ahead with
[25:12] number one and let's start
[25:15] because we're going to try to get to Eve
[25:17] tonight now is what we're trying to get
[25:18] to is to understand about Eve we went
[25:21] through two Services I put in both
[25:24] Services Sunday went back and viewed
[25:27] those messages to see if there was
[25:30] anything I needed to try to put in you
[25:33] know
[25:33] and and
[25:37] none of you didn't
[25:41] but I did to make sure
[25:45] because I want to make sure it's right
[25:48] but was you concerned enough to even
[25:50] consider what was said all right
[25:53] this quote we gave it Sunday but this is
[25:55] from demonology of Physical Realm 53.
[25:59] paragraph 27.
[26:01] but your souls were made up before the
[26:03] foundation of the world when God created
[26:06] man in his own image
[26:09] so when was this man of 126 and 27
[26:11] created
[26:15] just because it winds up at the end of
[26:18] chapter one
[26:20] it's like I've told you
[26:23] if you want to sit down sometime and
[26:24] let's just tear that one tear that apart
[26:28] we know Man was created on the sixth day
[26:30] right
[26:33] right
[26:34] we know the animals was created on the
[26:37] fifth day
[26:40] but take that and look at it looks like
[26:42] he's trying to pull it over into the
[26:44] sixth day
[26:47] that man was created on the sixth day
[26:50] physically
[26:52] it's not talking about his spiritual
[26:54] creation that's what your Prophet is
[26:56] saying this spiritual creation was
[26:58] before the world
[27:02] because it would be an impartation of
[27:05] God's own life
[27:08] and we'll get to it in a minute we tried
[27:09] Sunday to explain it because that's what
[27:11] God gave to Adam
[27:16] he gave him eternal life
[27:18] all right
[27:20] but your souls were made up before the
[27:22] foundation were okay All Souls in the
[27:25] mind of God
[27:29] he knew every one of them for the
[27:31] foundation world
[27:32] but did he make them let me let me you
[27:35] know
[27:37] did he make songs and put them in little
[27:39] cubicles
[27:41] little spaces
[27:43] and then when you come on Earth
[27:48] you say that's silly I know it
[27:50] that's what I'm trying to expose is how
[27:52] silly our minds are
[27:55] God didn't have to bring into being any
[27:57] Soul before the world he had it in his
[28:00] mind that made it more real than
[28:03] anything could ever be when we got here
[28:08] right
[28:10] so then all mankind of all over the
[28:13] world has ever been in the world
[28:15] God knew in his mind before the world
[28:18] would it be
[28:19] with this man is a special one
[28:24] because this is the manifestation of
[28:26] himself
[28:29] he says offspring
[28:31] it's his children
[28:37] when God created man and his own image
[28:39] Spirit of man not a man in his own image
[28:41] because man is fleshed you know in the
[28:44] animal but man in his own Embassy and
[28:46] then he made them male and female before
[28:49] he ever had a man in the dust of the
[28:51] Earth so now you know which one he's
[28:53] talking about right
[28:55] I wish we had a chance this after two
[28:56] can break it down you know that's
[28:59] between the line
[29:01] remember that in the message
[29:03] you know
[29:04] it's not written out on the line it's
[29:07] between the lines but just remember
[29:09] what's between the lines has got to be
[29:12] what the line says
[29:14] now that's not L I always say that
[29:16] l-i-n-e says
[29:18] all right
[29:20] it just took somebody to bring it out
[29:23] we could read Adam I mean we could read
[29:26] about Abraham and Sarah
[29:30] and his King falling in love with
[29:34] grandma
[29:37] but we couldn't figure that out
[29:40] But Here Come a prophet that made a
[29:42] simple statement it says
[29:44] they were turned back Young
[29:46] see he was reading between the lines
[29:49] right
[29:50] but it couldn't be no different or what
[29:52] was online
[29:55] see that's what people say well I know
[29:58] the line says one God but I read between
[30:01] the lines I got three
[30:04] now you got off the line
[30:08] right right
[30:10] so what's what he's saying
[30:13] now it's between the line
[30:16] but when you see it comes right up with
[30:18] the line
[30:20] you read it
[30:23] Shake ahead somebody's getting sleepy so
[30:25] read off the board
[30:28] see
[30:29] had gone back in the beginning what he
[30:32] did there and how he moved down into the
[30:36] Earth and how that he made Man In His
[30:38] Image and then God turned around and was
[30:41] made in the image of man to redeem the
[30:44] man
[30:45] so now we've read between the lines
[30:53] we've read the line that all man has
[30:55] made in the image of God
[30:59] and we know that he's in the mind of God
[31:01] and that's fine but now we read between
[31:03] the line and we find one man
[31:06] because we can't read on the line
[31:10] that all mankind you know everybody was
[31:13] made male and female right
[31:20] so now we've got to drop between the
[31:21] lines
[31:22] bringing up another man
[31:27] this man is Christ
[31:32] this is
[31:34] eternal life because did we read it
[31:37] Sunday
[31:38] where it read around and said that he
[31:40] put into Adam
[31:43] eternal life
[31:46] they need to become an eternal person
[31:48] with God
[31:50] well he said he simply put
[31:54] what
[31:55] the 126 man into the two seven
[32:00] right
[32:02] so the part
[32:04] to be and I know you don't like that
[32:05] most people don't like to use the word
[32:07] part but you show me where that and I
[32:10] love the way brother random brain he
[32:12] said we're a part of God
[32:14] I rejoice when I read that to find out
[32:18] I'm a part of God
[32:20] now I don't care what part I am
[32:24] right
[32:25] if I if I'm a toenail or a fingernail
[32:28] whatever I whatever he wants to make me
[32:32] that's the part I want to be because
[32:35] that part is just as much God as the
[32:39] rest of it
[32:40] your toenail's not part of somebody else
[32:43] it is you've got a toenail transplant
[32:45] somewhere
[32:47] all right
[32:49] something went wrong
[32:53] all right
[32:55] but are you with me now
[32:57] what your souls were made up now
[33:00] he's supposed to be talking to the
[33:02] church
[33:03] the bride of Christ the Bible's not
[33:04] written to the center right
[33:07] it says to the Saints at Ephesus it says
[33:09] to the Saints here it says the Bible
[33:10] brother said is not written to The
[33:13] Sinner it is written to those that are
[33:15] in Christ Jesus all right
[33:19] but see he's speaking to those that are
[33:21] in Christ Jesus set before the
[33:22] foundation of the world when God created
[33:24] man in his own image Spirit man of man
[33:27] not a man in his own image but Man In
[33:30] His Image he'd made them male and female
[33:33] before he ever ever had a man in the
[33:36] dust of the Earth
[33:39] keep that in your thinking
[33:42] this man was made male and female
[33:49] but it's supposed to be a type of Christ
[33:52] in the church
[33:56] huh
[34:00] but brother Dale I've just always
[34:02] believed that I was eternal
[34:04] I don't know what part I asked a man one
[34:06] time when he was riding down the highway
[34:09] brother collie but I was there and the
[34:11] poor old brother I got feeling sorry for
[34:14] him after they got through with him
[34:16] because he made a few little statements
[34:19] and when he did it went haywire I just
[34:21] asked him a simple question he said oh
[34:24] we come with this Gene in US
[34:28] remember
[34:30] and I I you know I just asked him a
[34:33] simple question
[34:34] where was it at
[34:36] was it in your body was it in your
[34:39] spirit or was it in your soul
[34:41] he said I'm not going to answer you
[34:44] then they took it up and I shut up and
[34:46] really I got feeling sorry for the poor
[34:48] old guy because they sure done a good
[34:50] job of quoting brother Branham
[34:53] all right
[34:56] what you see there's a lot said about we
[34:58] have eternal life
[35:01] now remember in all I'm bringing out to
[35:04] you and the messages I've brought
[35:06] is to bring one thing
[35:11] eternal life is God
[35:15] all right
[35:16] look what he says going up to 2A brother
[35:19] well who is this Melchizedek
[35:24] paragraph 48 notice those who have
[35:27] tonight
[35:28] eternal life
[35:30] was with him and in him
[35:33] in his thinking
[35:35] was with him and in him in his thinking
[35:39] now if you was with him and in him why
[35:42] would he use the word in his thinking
[35:47] okay
[35:49] before there Ever Was An Angel star
[35:52] cherubim or anything else that's Eternal
[35:55] and if you have eternal life you always
[35:57] was
[35:59] that's to stop there that settled it we
[36:02] always was
[36:04] yeah but read the rest of it
[36:09] not your being here
[36:14] but the shape and form that the infinite
[36:17] God
[36:20] to whatever was back there
[36:24] was in the infinite God or was the
[36:26] infinite God
[36:29] yeah but it said we was with him and we
[36:32] yeah John 1 1 says what in the beginning
[36:35] was the word and the Word was with God
[36:41] but then we stopped didn't we we had two
[36:45] but then somebody read the rest of it
[36:46] and said and the Word was God
[36:52] so we were with him and in him in his
[36:55] thinking
[36:59] but as I started to say a while ago
[37:01] be careful how you're using your
[37:03] thinking because
[37:05] I don't want to be just in his thinking
[37:12] because everybody in the world
[37:16] right right foreknowledge
[37:20] right
[37:21] everybody within his thinking
[37:25] I want to be a part of the Thinker
[37:30] right
[37:31] right I just want to be a part of that
[37:33] eternal life
[37:35] I want to be a part of the one that was
[37:37] doing the thinking don't you
[37:40] and if I'm a Child of God deny the
[37:42] eternal life that I have within me was a
[37:45] part of that God before he ever began to
[37:48] even think about anything about life
[37:51] endurance
[37:53] if you have eternal life
[37:57] eternal life was always eternal
[38:00] right not our being here
[38:03] come on now
[38:05] they asked brother Brandon said were we
[38:07] Spirits then
[38:08] pull up number two
[38:11] which is questions and answers in 1959
[38:14] 628.
[38:16] where were we Spirits then no
[38:20] we were not even nothing then
[38:25] but in God's mind we were
[38:30] and he spoke it and it materialized
[38:34] Jesus was slain before how many knows
[38:37] that the Bible teaches that Jesus Christ
[38:39] was the lamb slain before the
[38:41] foundational world why God spoke it and
[38:44] when he spoke it it was as good as
[38:46] finished and when he saw me he saw you
[38:49] before the foundation of the world we
[38:51] were only figurative
[38:52] figurative in his mind then when he come
[38:57] to the world
[39:04] now you read them
[39:05] then when he come to the world
[39:08] we were both male and female
[39:11] male and female
[39:14] he separated the feminist Spirit from
[39:16] the man and made a woman out of it and
[39:20] left the masculine spirit in the man
[39:24] now may I restate
[39:27] you cannot use that for all mankind
[39:35] he's going to be a special person
[39:38] because the person's got to be male and
[39:40] female
[39:42] that's the only point I'm trying to make
[39:44] you can argue philosophy is all you want
[39:46] to but you've got to come back to that
[39:48] statement
[39:52] it was only a special being that could
[39:55] be male and female
[39:59] and that being would be none other than
[40:01] God himself
[40:05] well you're trying to make us God
[40:09] according to the Bible That's What We
[40:12] Are
[40:16] and just remember your Prophet was so
[40:19] strict about the way he said things so
[40:21] straight he said Adam was the god of the
[40:24] earth he says now Adam was not the god
[40:27] of Heaven
[40:29] right he made a distinction between the
[40:33] two
[40:36] because he knew we'd run it Wild
[40:42] let's just read a little bit on number
[40:43] three here
[40:45] is taken from the message of the
[40:47] identified Masterpiece of God
[40:50] starting off paragraph 51 and
[40:53] I think we've got about three or four
[40:55] paragraphs
[40:56] let us turn now our thoughts from
[40:58] Michelangelo to the great sculpture God
[41:01] almighty who in the beginning before
[41:03] there was a day or dawn of day for there
[41:05] was an atom or a molecule God in his
[41:08] mind had man and what a man should look
[41:10] like what he should be and what he
[41:12] should act like he wanted that man to be
[41:15] a part of him
[41:17] so he made man in his own image and in
[41:20] the likeness of God created he
[41:24] man oh when God in the beginning made
[41:28] this masterpiece something that
[41:31] reflected his thoughts remember there's
[41:33] only one form of eternal life
[41:36] an hour even our names and our thoughts
[41:39] were with God before there was a
[41:40] foundation of the world because now we
[41:43] possess eternal life and to do that we
[41:46] have to be a part of God
[41:49] right
[41:52] so we've we'd have to be as much as in
[41:56] his thoughts
[41:57] cause we have eternal life and was
[42:00] predestinated to this life and her names
[42:02] were put on the Lamb's Book of Life
[42:03] before the foundation of the world
[42:05] according to Revelations now that God
[42:08] had us in his thinking then we have
[42:11] eternal life because then he spoke us
[42:14] and we come into existence
[42:18] and a word is just a thought manifested
[42:22] God had us in the beginning in his
[42:25] thoughts
[42:27] now and when he made Adam that first man
[42:31] how perfect it was he looked like God
[42:36] the great Holy Spirit brooding over the
[42:39] Earth and he the birds come out maybe
[42:42] and the animals different things and he
[42:44] kept coming more in the form of the one
[42:46] that was brooding
[42:47] until finally there come up a specie
[42:50] just exactly like the one that was doing
[42:54] the brooding
[42:56] right
[42:58] God God would man was made in the image
[43:01] of God then when he placed him in his
[43:04] great this Garden like Michael and great
[43:07] Garden like Michelangelo has placed his
[43:10] great life's work and all the great
[43:12] sculptures God placed his handiwork in
[43:14] the Garden of Eden made him a help me
[43:17] mate what a complete satisfaction it was
[43:22] to god Till even he rested it was just
[43:26] at rest his work had been finished
[43:30] now
[43:34] do you believe that Eve was in Adam
[43:43] we have been over that enough in reading
[43:45] the scriptures and taking the rib and
[43:47] made it
[43:49] until even our little children ought to
[43:51] understand that he was in Adam
[43:53] but do you believe he was in Adam in
[43:55] that creation that for the foundation of
[43:57] the world
[44:01] there's the thought for tonight
[44:07] do you believe Eve was in Adam
[44:13] well I'll go along with it she's in his
[44:15] flesh
[44:16] well
[44:18] the Bible didn't say that
[44:22] the Bible said this man that he made
[44:26] was made male and female
[44:31] and then he gave them
[44:34] Dominion
[44:36] over everything of course now brother
[44:39] Dale you were not in the message because
[44:41] we know them women ain't nothing but old
[44:43] byproducts
[44:45] they they're a bunch of hamburger meat
[44:47] but we're good porterhouse steak
[44:55] I've fought that for 40 something years
[44:59] probably been called a lot of things
[45:01] because of doing it
[45:04] but I wished you would go home
[45:06] and look up the word byproduct
[45:15] have you ever looked it up I mean ask
[45:17] you to raise your hand but how many of
[45:18] you ever looked up byproduct
[45:21] somehow
[45:23] some of you smart enough you don't need
[45:25] to look it up
[45:27] but you might be dumb enough to not know
[45:29] what it means
[45:33] the Webster then to you that raised your
[45:36] hand you heard him say this that a
[45:38] byproduct is of equal value or greater
[45:44] no that ain't in my dictionary okay
[45:52] Peggy used to have the idea she got it
[45:54] from somewhere that
[45:55] somebody told her that
[45:58] you'd never be able to tell the
[46:00] difference in the summer and winter
[46:01] except for the shedding of the leaves
[46:03] and the button of the trees
[46:04] I said Dane in the Bible it's always
[46:06] going to be shedding of the leaves and
[46:08] butting to the trees and that is the
[46:09] seasons is what brings it you go
[46:11] overseas go over there in Jamaica and
[46:13] look at a tree and then stay that way
[46:15] all year round because it doesn't have
[46:16] any problems no weather conditions
[46:20] but you see ever tub will sit on its own
[46:23] bottom
[46:25] that's in the Bible my grandma told me
[46:27] that
[46:30] well sorry about it but grandma didn't
[46:33] know everything
[46:35] well you're throwing off with my grandma
[46:37] no I'm thrown off on you for believing
[46:38] it
[46:42] you ever heard the one where it's better
[46:44] to put you seed in the belly of a
[46:45] than put it in
[46:48] trying to make some kind of garbage can
[46:50] out of the Bible
[46:53] better do that than just spill it on the
[46:55] ground
[46:58] but they'll swear by and die by it
[47:02] I read that
[47:04] well praying it on
[47:09] I don't have a lot of money but I'll
[47:11] give you ten thousand bucks to bring
[47:12] those three statements to me out of the
[47:15] Bible
[47:18] because you ain't going to find it
[47:22] but you see we'd rather take what
[47:24] grandma and grandpa said
[47:29] brother Branham
[47:31] we just read said he wanted that man
[47:35] to be part of him
[47:37] so he made man in his own image
[47:40] into the likeness of God created He-Man
[47:46] male and female
[47:48] a creation
[47:52] cannot apply to all mankind
[47:55] it can only apply to a certain being and
[47:58] remember I am not that far off either
[48:02] just because a man and his wife becomes
[48:06] one that does not make them
[48:09] exactly like Adam and Eve
[48:14] right
[48:17] piggy wasn't in me
[48:19] Gail you wouldn't in brother dick could
[48:21] probably helped him if he would have
[48:22] been
[48:27] let's keep on reading now let's see
[48:37] what do you understand
[48:43] do you understand I'm asking the
[48:45] question because we got it on over here
[48:46] in a minute
[48:47] when we get down to it uh
[48:50] about
[48:51] Adam and about
[48:53] Eve and how that
[48:56] a man and woman was made one there were
[48:59] one they were separated one put in flesh
[49:02] one in theophany
[49:06] when he made a natural man he put him in
[49:08] flesh
[49:11] the afternoon of Eve would not put there
[49:16] only the feminist part
[49:20] not a theophany
[49:22] she was with him
[49:26] in the spiritual creation
[49:29] and she was part of him in the natural
[49:31] creation
[49:33] we'll get that to that a while
[49:36] but I want to see if what you believe
[49:42] you see this man of 126 and 27 then
[49:45] would be a special creation of
[49:50] and it would be male and female
[49:54] all right
[49:56] but there wasn't two people standing
[49:58] there
[50:03] you say well
[50:06] are you going to believe that man and
[50:08] his wife is a type of Christ in church I
[50:10] believe that
[50:12] but I don't believe today man and wife
[50:14] is one soul
[50:18] there too
[50:20] they're two people
[50:22] but if you're born again
[50:27] amen if the husband and wife is born
[50:30] again
[50:31] they only have one theophany
[50:36] One Soul
[50:37] that dwells within them which is the
[50:40] soul of almighty God
[50:43] now you explain eternal life any other
[50:46] way
[50:50] but see we've got a little problem there
[50:52] with Adam and Eve
[50:56] that we've got to consider
[51:01] and to to think about it
[51:08] see because this 126 man
[51:16] the part that was to be Adam went into
[51:19] Adam
[51:21] when he breathed into his nostrils and
[51:23] he became a living soul
[51:30] Eve was still in the theophany and
[51:32] hadn't been transported down yet
[51:33] remember what the words you want to use
[51:37] so then you've got to think about
[51:39] something
[51:43] now what's the point follow it
[51:47] Adam and Eve was not one soul
[51:51] there were two people
[51:58] but they were one in the original soul
[52:03] of before the foundation of the world
[52:08] me and my wife both of us have eternal
[52:11] life
[52:12] by the new birth
[52:14] all right
[52:17] then by being that away
[52:21] that's just one soul
[52:23] but it's two Souls having that and it
[52:25] ain't the two Soul doctor okay that's a
[52:28] couple of souls having that get away
[52:29] from two Souls
[52:32] then think about it how many born-again
[52:34] Believers you think's in the world today
[52:35] let's give a number
[52:37] a million
[52:39] there's any problem with that or you
[52:40] don't cut it down a little bit because
[52:41] maybe you don't think it's okay A
[52:43] hundred thousand
[52:44] you want to cut down a little further
[52:46] ten thousand
[52:48] I don't care come on down to a thousand
[52:52] you know that are true Born Again
[52:53] believers
[52:55] you know that every one of them is one
[52:57] with Christ
[53:00] every one of them has eternal life
[53:03] and every one of them the soul of God
[53:05] came to their so being and made it
[53:10] eternal
[53:11] oh I want to get to that
[53:19] but I said your soul is just if you have
[53:21] a new birth it's just as Eternal as
[53:23] it'll ever be
[53:30] right you're not too sold out of you
[53:31] ever notice he's making this statement
[53:33] he said it's maybe he says me and God
[53:36] where he said either you and God
[53:38] together as persons
[53:40] that's not two people
[53:45] and God came in and give you eternal
[53:47] life sister Gail
[53:49] that eternal life
[53:51] is his soul coming to you
[53:55] you explain it any other way because the
[53:57] Bible plainly tells you he gave
[54:01] his own life as a ransom
[54:05] you remember the other day can we find a
[54:07] ransom for the soul
[54:12] take on these things see we're requiring
[54:14] you to think a little bit
[54:21] so when this
[54:22] as we covered Sunday now right to that
[54:25] part
[54:26] that this 126 man was put into 2 7.
[54:30] and we read it from Blasphemous names
[54:31] we're especially into Adam right
[54:35] came eternal life
[54:37] all right
[54:41] look what he says about this man
[54:47] Number Four Brothers which is Oneness
[54:49] 1962.
[54:50] paragraph 146.
[54:54] because we
[54:55] I didn't mark these for them
[54:59] sheep don't household
[55:02] see nothing had a soul has a soul but
[55:04] man God put he's an animal form that's
[55:10] true
[55:11] but he put a soul on him that's what
[55:13] made him different from the animals he
[55:16] node right from wrong when his soul came
[55:19] on him
[55:27] he didn't know right and wrong before
[55:28] then
[55:32] I could stop and spend a little time
[55:34] talking but I don't want to throw out
[55:36] too much but remember
[55:38] you're supposed to know right and wrong
[55:40] but it doesn't
[55:41] get marking against you until you reach
[55:43] the age of accountability
[55:45] right
[55:48] right okay see they just you think I'm
[55:49] trying to throw out too much I'm trying
[55:52] to I told my wife the other day I said
[55:55] honey I go in there and I said I tear
[55:58] that up and throw it away I turn it up
[56:00] and throw it away
[56:02] I'm trying to bring it down to where we
[56:05] can understand
[56:10] what's being said
[56:12] because look
[56:14] he's an animal form that's true but he
[56:16] put a soul on him that's what made him
[56:18] different from the animals he knowed
[56:20] right and wrong right from wrong when
[56:23] his soul came on him but he remember
[56:25] when God created man in his own image
[56:27] and then he became a living Soul see he
[56:32] became that knowing right from wrong
[56:38] you know the Bible says that a woman who
[56:40] lives in pleasure is what
[56:43] dead won't she liveth is that scripture
[56:46] you know that you're not a living soul
[56:50] now you're gonna have to swallow
[56:52] two parts okay baby gets life it's a
[56:55] living Soul it's a human being it's
[56:57] going but that's not the right one right
[57:00] when that baby gets born again then it
[57:02] really becomes a living soul
[57:04] right
[57:07] until then it's just like anything else
[57:09] a little higher than the animal
[57:11] but not a lot
[57:13] you remember what we brought out on the
[57:15] Blasphemous names
[57:18] how that brother Branham says that
[57:23] the Breath of Life go ahead and roll it
[57:26] up let's read it because
[57:28] I don't mind quoting again what things
[57:30] are said
[57:31] go ahead to
[57:33] number six
[57:37] now here's Jehovah Witnesses in their
[57:39] book it says it's a breath that you
[57:40] breathe it's the soul now that cannot be
[57:42] right the breath that you breathe is not
[57:45] Soul all right the breath is the wind
[57:48] the different things and you take the
[57:49] scripture they take the scripture that
[57:52] he breathed the breath into his nostrils
[57:53] and he became a living Soul running on
[57:55] up to save us time we went through that
[57:56] Sunday all right
[57:59] see if you've done that you'd have
[58:01] everybody breathe and the animals would
[58:03] Breathe this whole and we'd believe this
[58:04] whole girl can't be
[58:06] but what God did he breathed the breath
[58:08] of eternal life
[58:10] amen then he became a living soul
[58:13] who into Adam right
[58:15] that's when he put the 126 into 2 7.
[58:18] right
[58:19] is that is that simple enough he put the
[58:22] 126 man the spirit man into 2 7.
[58:27] but you got to remember because I ain't
[58:29] gonna get there tonight but you got to
[58:31] remember
[58:32] that Eve was left
[58:35] in theophany
[58:37] she didn't come into flesh man to start
[58:41] with
[58:43] you got to wait till her body comes
[58:46] he said we're going to get become a
[58:47] living Soul a soul that can't die and
[58:49] watch we're going to get into honey
[58:50] plume to your to your elbows notice
[58:52] breathe the breath of eternal life into
[58:54] his nostrils and he became an eternal
[58:56] soul
[58:58] because God breathed not what nature
[59:01] done now do you understand that
[59:04] he's simply saying God breathes into
[59:07] your nostrils eternal life and he's
[59:09] using it as a nature
[59:12] would this be natural life as you're
[59:15] living do you understand that one
[59:18] right now I think nature is not nature
[59:22] so don't fool around the trouble you
[59:23] mean the nature give me that
[59:25] no God had to give it to you
[59:33] what God did he breathed the breath of
[59:34] life into his nostrils and he became a
[59:36] living Soul then you say to me Adam died
[59:39] brother Branham
[59:42] but remember before Adam died he had a
[59:45] lamb that redeemed him
[59:48] right now we will get back to that
[59:51] statement so remember it but remember
[59:54] before Adam died
[59:56] he had a lamb that redeemed him
[1:00:02] Now where's that at in the Bible
[1:00:06] because Adam sinned and God
[1:00:10] branked the animal
[1:00:11] and killed it
[1:00:14] right
[1:00:15] come on
[1:00:19] we got to get between the lines and stay
[1:00:21] on the lines and run with it
[1:00:26] Adam come into the world
[1:00:29] and then he sinned and then God made an
[1:00:32] atonement as far as the natural but as
[1:00:35] far as the spiritual he was a lamb that
[1:00:37] stood slain before the foundation of the
[1:00:40] world
[1:00:40] amen he already had a lamb
[1:00:43] before his tinned he had a lamb
[1:00:46] right
[1:00:48] but remember before Adam died
[1:00:52] he had a lamb that redeemed him
[1:00:54] Hallelujah because we're going to show
[1:00:56] when we get to it that Adam died
[1:01:03] you know when he died
[1:01:05] when he sinned
[1:01:07] he lived 500 something years no longer
[1:01:10] all right we've got a lot to go
[1:01:13] those who before knew he would he has
[1:01:15] caught
[1:01:16] he got a lamb to redeem them he was a
[1:01:18] type Adam failed then the lamb was
[1:01:20] provided for Adam because already in his
[1:01:22] nostrils had become the breath of
[1:01:24] Eternal the Eternal God and he'd become
[1:01:27] a living Soul he was the son of God is
[1:01:29] that what the Bible said Adam was the
[1:01:31] son of God
[1:01:32] all right
[1:01:34] especially
[1:01:37] into Adam
[1:01:41] gonna look up especially I'm gonna come
[1:01:43] up in your computer you got to look up
[1:01:45] specially
[1:01:46] until you do that because it saves you
[1:01:48] trouble I wrote I tried he's special you
[1:01:51] know I tried that for so long until I
[1:01:53] wore out and it didn't work and I
[1:01:55] finally spelled it special when it come
[1:01:57] up
[1:01:58] okay
[1:02:00] but are you with me
[1:02:06] what about this next statements one I
[1:02:08] love because if you think it don't tie
[1:02:10] with Redemption
[1:02:11] go up to number seven brother
[1:02:14] 232 Blasphemous names number seven
[1:02:20] the church is the mystical
[1:02:23] Body of Christ
[1:02:26] borned
[1:02:28] of the Breath of God
[1:02:31] if you have a new birth today
[1:02:34] you're born by the Breath of God
[1:02:38] it gives you eternal life watch it but
[1:02:40] look how far it goes did you get it
[1:02:42] congregation said amen the Church of God
[1:02:45] is born to the Breath of God God
[1:02:47] breathes breath into the nostrils
[1:02:50] spiritually of Adam and he became a
[1:02:53] living soul
[1:02:54] did you know the Pentecostals are the
[1:02:56] true Pentecostal Church
[1:02:58] is born of the Breath of God
[1:03:02] they got another one
[1:03:04] going on to this one in a minute
[1:03:08] in case I forget it don't get it on
[1:03:10] tonight
[1:03:12] he said when that image is brought all
[1:03:14] the way up
[1:03:18] then he breathes on it and she becomes a
[1:03:20] living soul
[1:03:24] special something in there
[1:03:28] think about Eve for a minute
[1:03:33] let's see I want you to see that Eve was
[1:03:35] in that original creation
[1:03:40] that's that's what gets you when brother
[1:03:42] Branham is trying to explain that she's
[1:03:45] not in the original creation because of
[1:03:48] the fact that she was he had stopped
[1:03:50] creating and then you know she wasn't
[1:03:53] made male
[1:03:54] it wouldn't Adam made a male an evil
[1:03:57] female like the dogs and the cats and
[1:04:00] the people just run that thing so
[1:04:01] Haywire until it's silly
[1:04:07] but for one statement I wished you would
[1:04:10] read it in the Bible
[1:04:12] that he took from Adam
[1:04:15] a rib
[1:04:17] she never come out of a secondary
[1:04:18] creation
[1:04:20] she was right out of the original
[1:04:22] but not as a person at the time
[1:04:26] right
[1:04:30] then look up byproduct I don't care what
[1:04:33] you say it I mean I believe byproduct
[1:04:34] means something that's worth a Bad Thing
[1:04:36] something down below
[1:04:40] well
[1:04:42] you ain't gonna believe it anyway so
[1:04:45] forget it
[1:04:46] go buy your product
[1:04:49] I told you I don't like jokes
[1:04:54] well what do you think about Eve
[1:04:58] let's read what your Prophet had to say
[1:05:00] go to number 10 questions and answers on
[1:05:02] Hebrews number three
[1:05:05] since 57.
[1:05:09] 1006.
[1:05:11] now God in the beginning when he knowed
[1:05:13] man and woman was made one not two
[1:05:18] they were made one
[1:05:20] they were separated
[1:05:23] one put in flesh
[1:05:27] and one in with theophany
[1:05:32] so they got the same theophany
[1:05:36] we'll get that in a minute now don't try
[1:05:38] to make a soul let you onto a soul so
[1:05:41] much because we've got to define
[1:05:42] something real close
[1:05:45] all right
[1:05:47] he knew that so in order to prove that
[1:05:50] to you when God made the woman he never
[1:05:52] took some dust and made her like he did
[1:05:55] the man
[1:05:59] no she's just a byproduct
[1:06:04] he thought so much of her until she was
[1:06:07] not created like the other animals were
[1:06:10] created
[1:06:11] we don't hear that do you
[1:06:14] no it's just a byproduct
[1:06:19] right
[1:06:22] she can't even be circumcised she's not
[1:06:25] in the Kingdom without a head
[1:06:31] I thought by the new Earth Christ with
[1:06:33] her head
[1:06:36] yeah
[1:06:38] but he took a rib out of his side
[1:06:40] and she become a byproduct
[1:06:43] of a man
[1:06:47] because she's part of him you get it now
[1:06:51] she's part of him
[1:06:55] but look when he was put in flesh
[1:06:58] one put in flesh
[1:07:01] one
[1:07:03] in a theophany
[1:07:06] look at the next one
[1:07:09] question is answered on Hebrews 3 but
[1:07:11] it's
[1:07:12] going on to paragraph
[1:07:14] 8 26.
[1:07:16] and as he walked through the Garden of
[1:07:18] Eden first is theophany like the holy
[1:07:21] spirit is in here now walking in here it
[1:07:24] led the animal life and it controlled
[1:07:26] everything but it couldn't till the soil
[1:07:28] so we put man so he put him in flesh so
[1:07:31] that he could till the soil give him his
[1:07:33] five senses to till the soil and fix up
[1:07:36] in The Vineyards and so forth and then
[1:07:38] the man still looked Lonesome oh this is
[1:07:41] a beautiful picture
[1:07:42] look for when he was first made he was
[1:07:46] made two people together
[1:07:50] now you can't put that between me and
[1:07:52] Peggy and the natural life now right
[1:07:55] right I don't care how much you think I
[1:07:58] got my wife
[1:08:02] well a lot of them got what what was it
[1:08:05] on Wiki uh
[1:08:07] Gallant married about seven different
[1:08:10] men I ain't gonna call the name gonna be
[1:08:12] on tape but y'all did
[1:08:15] okay
[1:08:17] well that won't work too good but
[1:08:20] well she gonna be in heaven
[1:08:22] I don't think he's going to get tired
[1:08:23] but that's all right God
[1:08:26] look for when he was first made he was
[1:08:29] made to people made two people together
[1:08:33] he was made both male and female the man
[1:08:35] was the Bible said he was God made man
[1:08:40] both male and female created he him
[1:08:43] notice now when man was separated from
[1:08:47] the theophany and put in flesh
[1:08:50] he was he wasn't just all together there
[1:08:54] part of his being was still in a
[1:08:56] theophany so it didn't look right
[1:09:02] well
[1:09:04] something lacking
[1:09:06] in Adam wouldn't it
[1:09:08] Adam was lonesome
[1:09:11] something lacking in Adam
[1:09:17] go ahead let's see
[1:09:20] Adam was lonesome was going to 29. okay
[1:09:25] she was part of him look at this one
[1:09:27] never went and got dirt and made Eve but
[1:09:29] he made from the original dirt that made
[1:09:33] it from Adams here and he took a rib
[1:09:35] from his side and made him a helpmate
[1:09:36] and that was Eve she was made for the
[1:09:40] man and part of the man
[1:09:43] before I get onto that other I know
[1:09:45] people might want to make me a smarter
[1:09:46] like I'm not correcting brother Branham
[1:09:48] but the Bible does not say help mate
[1:09:54] the Bible says help meet
[1:09:57] read your Bible Genesis
[1:10:00] give him a help meet mate can be two men
[1:10:04] right
[1:10:07] meat means part of you
[1:10:10] man and wife is one okay yeah I'm
[1:10:13] smarter like all right
[1:10:16] but look she was made for the man and
[1:10:18] part of the man
[1:10:19] she was part of him in the beginning in
[1:10:22] the creation in the theophany
[1:10:25] she was part of him down here in this
[1:10:27] creation
[1:10:29] she could not be divided in another
[1:10:31] creation she had to be made in the same
[1:10:34] creation that's exactly why Christ and
[1:10:37] God had to be the very same person
[1:10:43] couldn't be too
[1:10:46] had to be the same person right
[1:10:53] are you with me
[1:11:05] he was lonesome
[1:11:07] took a rib
[1:11:11] from this man Adam
[1:11:13] made a body
[1:11:19] stood the body there with Adam
[1:11:24] in any place to 126 into Eve
[1:11:30] now remember Adam never had a name under
[1:11:33] the 126 man there's no name mentioned
[1:11:40] remember Eve never had a name until she
[1:11:43] fell
[1:11:45] because Eve means the mother of all
[1:11:47] living and at the time she was there she
[1:11:50] wasn't the mother of anything
[1:11:52] when she was there in Adam
[1:11:54] what do you understand
[1:11:56] Adam and Eve
[1:12:00] the only time that could ever happen
[1:12:03] was placed like that
[1:12:07] you want to stay all night and let me
[1:12:09] talk about where brother random said and
[1:12:12] we will get back to it
[1:12:13] where brother random said that Jesus
[1:12:16] come here with us in him
[1:12:20] he said I walked ashore to Galilee
[1:12:23] in him
[1:12:28] but you know what they'd rather do and
[1:12:29] rejoice about it everybody wants to
[1:12:31] Rejoice to think not that that we come
[1:12:34] here in Jesus they want to think that
[1:12:36] Jesus come here in them
[1:12:40] because that's all that eternals and
[1:12:42] predestinations deal
[1:12:46] now just remember
[1:12:49] Eve was in Adam
[1:12:55] and if there's any part about you and I
[1:12:57] that was in Christ it would have to be
[1:12:59] part of the eternal life
[1:13:02] because we were not little bitty peoples
[1:13:04] running around in the body of Christ
[1:13:08] we ought to be dumb and I mean smart
[1:13:10] enough to
[1:13:11] figure that one out
[1:13:13] and not dumb enough to swallow it
[1:13:17] what are you following me now here's
[1:13:19] Adam he's made and God breathed into his
[1:13:22] nostrils and he become a living soul
[1:13:25] here's Eve she's made
[1:13:27] God breathed into her nostrils she
[1:13:30] become a living soul
[1:13:32] now I don't mind even stating it to you
[1:13:36] because somebody's going to come up with
[1:13:37] it anyway so I'll beat you to it brother
[1:13:40] Branham never talked about God breathing
[1:13:42] into Eve
[1:13:48] No statement
[1:13:50] foreign
[1:13:52] what are you doing
[1:13:56] I'm reading between the lines
[1:14:02] well that's your reading okay what's
[1:14:05] yours
[1:14:07] I don't mind doing it that way I'll
[1:14:09] listen to you
[1:14:12] but you see where our problem is is not
[1:14:13] thinking about that Adam had to have a
[1:14:17] human soul
[1:14:22] to be Adam
[1:14:27] if you put the spirit
[1:14:29] in the soul of God into flesh without
[1:14:32] bringing a name or titles to it or
[1:14:34] something wait you've got God
[1:14:39] it's all right because Adam was but
[1:14:42] still get my point
[1:14:45] that man Adam
[1:14:47] brother Branham State and I've got it
[1:14:49] right in here he said there he stood
[1:14:51] with his feet in the earth dead
[1:14:59] I don't mind giving you both
[1:15:00] oppositional sides
[1:15:02] because I want you to think
[1:15:05] but I want you to think about sensible
[1:15:07] time
[1:15:11] Body Spirit and soul makes a man right
[1:15:15] So Adam was Body Spirit and soul
[1:15:17] standing there
[1:15:21] and God placed eternal life into the
[1:15:24] soul of Adam
[1:15:25] and he became a living being
[1:15:28] Eve was taken from Adam
[1:15:32] but around said the feminist part
[1:15:36] was taken from Adam
[1:15:38] and placed into a body
[1:15:43] and she was given made a living Soul now
[1:15:47] or either she's still dead some if
[1:15:49] that's not true
[1:15:51] and remember my point is
[1:15:54] if Adam came from theophany to flesh
[1:15:58] and Eve was still in theophany then when
[1:16:01] that was put in flesh Adam and Eve both
[1:16:03] had eternal life
[1:16:06] there's a type of Christ in the church
[1:16:11] not every man and woman is in the world
[1:16:16] mm-hmm you can't top every man and woman
[1:16:19] in the world as a type of Christ in the
[1:16:20] church
[1:16:22] you got to bring it to the right place
[1:16:26] so
[1:16:27] I'm telling you what I believe
[1:16:30] Adam was Body Spirit and soul and then
[1:16:33] God breathed into his nostrils
[1:16:36] eternal life
[1:16:39] and there's Adam
[1:16:44] the son of God
[1:16:51] if you don't believe that Soul then how
[1:16:53] does it do with
[1:16:54] Jesus when he came
[1:16:56] but that's all right
[1:16:59] Eve then was
[1:17:01] taken from Adam and the part that she
[1:17:03] would have been in the original with
[1:17:05] Adam in theophany was placed into
[1:17:10] Eve and she became a living Camus
[1:17:13] living soul
[1:17:18] eternal life
[1:17:19] in the original Power that started it
[1:17:24] eternal life
[1:17:26] me
[1:17:28] and what are you and I
[1:17:39] look at number 14.
[1:17:44] taken from adoption number two 1965-18
[1:17:51] now but he wanted to put things in time
[1:17:56] he had to make something to worship
[1:17:59] so his attributes produce this
[1:18:03] then he made the man you said well the
[1:18:06] Angels worshiped him
[1:18:08] that ain't the kind of worship God wants
[1:18:12] I'm sorry
[1:18:14] our smartness runs us into the ground to
[1:18:16] miss the rest of the story
[1:18:18] Angels worshiping and just makes him God
[1:18:22] man worships him makes him
[1:18:26] father over his children
[1:18:31] okay
[1:18:33] he had to make something to worship
[1:18:36] so his attributes produce this
[1:18:38] then he made the man
[1:18:40] then in this man he looked along some so
[1:18:43] now to show now his great mind what he
[1:18:47] had in
[1:18:49] picture
[1:18:50] of the Christ and the church
[1:18:55] now are you with me I've been stating
[1:18:57] that over and over and over but now we
[1:19:00] read it
[1:19:02] he took not a different piece of clay
[1:19:04] and made a woman but he took from the
[1:19:06] side of Adam a rib and took from the
[1:19:08] spirit of Adam the feminist and put it
[1:19:10] in this rib
[1:19:14] what about it
[1:19:23] pull up number 15 we'll read this and
[1:19:25] then we'll quit
[1:19:26] because I only want to read the bottom
[1:19:28] part we read the first part
[1:19:30] Bring It On It
[1:19:31] 236.
[1:19:35] um
[1:19:37] come on there you go 235 Church mourned
[1:19:40] on the Breath of God this is taken from
[1:19:42] blasphemy missed names right down below
[1:19:44] where we were reading while ago Church
[1:19:46] born to the Breath of God when this
[1:19:48] stature has molded itself up there in
[1:19:51] condition God's
[1:19:55] breathe breath breathe upon them receive
[1:20:00] ye the Holy Ghost
[1:20:01] then you are a son of God
[1:20:05] and look at what brother random would
[1:20:06] say
[1:20:08] you can join anything you want to
[1:20:14] now is he telling you when you come up
[1:20:17] in the Statue of a perfect man to The
[1:20:19] Headstone you can join in church you
[1:20:20] want to if it is but you're blind as a
[1:20:24] bat come on up a little close to where
[1:20:25] you can read
[1:20:29] what's he saying
[1:20:32] he said you can join anything you want
[1:20:34] to but you're born into the Church of
[1:20:36] the Living God
[1:20:37] born by the Breath of God God breathed
[1:20:40] upon them and said receive ye who eat
[1:20:42] the Holy Ghost oh my there you are and
[1:20:45] you remember in the Bible
[1:20:49] you know that he preached upon them
[1:20:52] and said receive ye the Holy Ghost
[1:20:56] six months before Pentecost
[1:21:02] right nobody's giving you six months I
[1:21:04] don't really know okay but before then
[1:21:07] okay
[1:21:10] but what was your prophet's answer to
[1:21:13] that
[1:21:15] he said they said did they get the Holy
[1:21:18] Ghost right then he said no
[1:21:21] that was only a promise
[1:21:25] see because Jesus Christ hadn't died
[1:21:30] right when this pyramid is finished
[1:21:33] and the bride of Christ as a whole
[1:21:41] then he can breathe upon her
[1:21:45] it's a promise right now
[1:21:48] but what a promise
[1:21:52] but one day it won't be a promise
[1:21:56] you say one day
[1:21:58] I'm not making it out in the future and
[1:22:00] I'm not making it out in the past
[1:22:02] I'm making it ever when he takes care of
[1:22:05] it
[1:22:07] when he adopts the church fully
[1:22:10] I believe he adopts individuals
[1:22:13] into the body of Christ
[1:22:17] I've had a lot of people argue with me
[1:22:19] and fuss like crazy and he'll say
[1:22:21] brother Dale when a man is adopted he
[1:22:24] cannot die I said well brother Branham
[1:22:26] did and Lord Jesus did so now you go
[1:22:28] argue all your points
[1:22:32] you say you can't die when you adopted
[1:22:34] brother Branham did
[1:22:39] well well he had to go that's okay
[1:22:41] that's not the point the point is he did
[1:22:50] you see one day death is going to be
[1:22:51] destroyed
[1:22:53] and then
[1:22:55] the bride of Christ won't have to die
[1:22:59] death will be destroyed one day
[1:23:03] in you and I come on you musicians
[1:23:07] What About Eve
[1:23:10] Eve was a part of God a part of Adam in
[1:23:13] the original and Adam was a part of God
[1:23:18] so Eve was a part of God to Eternal part
[1:23:21] she's placed in the flesh God breathed
[1:23:24] into her nostrils and she become a
[1:23:25] living soul
[1:23:29] yeah but
[1:23:32] stand out because look what he's done
[1:23:37] poor
[1:23:38] ignoramus
[1:23:43] is there anything is a big sin or a
[1:23:45] little sin
[1:23:46] foreign
[1:23:48] such thing as a big sin or a little sin
[1:23:55] well then the least thing that we could
[1:23:57] do would be enough to annihilate us
[1:23:58] right
[1:24:04] but yet you're a born-again Christian
[1:24:10] brother Dale I don't sin your Prophet
[1:24:14] said he did every day
[1:24:21] now
[1:24:25] but I I I can't see it that's right the
[1:24:28] Inside Man Of You
[1:24:30] little John says it that seed cannot sin
[1:24:33] inside of you can't sin if you're a
[1:24:35] born-again Christian but these outside
[1:24:38] body
[1:24:39] he's got a lot of problems
[1:24:43] right
[1:24:44] and we'll be according to your Prophet a
[1:24:47] sticker as long as we live
[1:24:51] well you don't think we're going to get
[1:24:53] better and better and better I've been
[1:24:55] watching for 40 years trying to find
[1:24:57] some better and I ain't found no better
[1:24:58] and you ain't found no better than me
[1:25:00] may I quote brother Brandon from the
[1:25:02] tape last night
[1:25:04] the priest in 1961
[1:25:07] he said
[1:25:09] the Azusa Street people
[1:25:13] now it's paraphrasing but it's very
[1:25:15] close he said azusa's treat people
[1:25:18] had more of God working among them than
[1:25:22] we do now
[1:25:26] he said because they didn't have
[1:25:28] anything they just had to go on what
[1:25:31] they hadn't believe God
[1:25:36] let's quote all he said
[1:25:39] let's talk about all he said
[1:25:43] that way we won't have to fool around
[1:25:45] with
[1:25:46] wondering what this is and that is
[1:25:52] you see those people back there had to
[1:25:54] believe God and had to search for
[1:25:55] sometimes for food to eat
[1:26:00] you think down to the Dark Ages when
[1:26:02] they were being killed just for
[1:26:03] believing they were Christians
[1:26:07] you know we get our feelings hurt
[1:26:09] because somebody don't shake our hey
[1:26:16] yeah
[1:26:17] he didn't speak to me
[1:26:23] let's stand
[1:26:28] but Eve was a part of Adam
[1:26:32] both spiritually speaking and physically
[1:26:34] speaking
[1:26:36] but then there was never any other man
[1:26:38] that away
[1:26:39] until the Lord Jesus came
[1:26:42] he was not a man to the Old Testament
[1:26:44] whatever brought forth as male and
[1:26:45] female can't be
[1:26:47] but when Jesus Christ came
[1:26:51] he came with us in him
[1:26:55] and we are the bride so he came male and
[1:26:57] female not a morphodite now don't be
[1:27:00] stupid
[1:27:05] he came here with us in him the part of
[1:27:09] eternal life that he was
[1:27:13] why can't you read what brother Randall
[1:27:15] says and think but common sense when he
[1:27:17] says a part of God went out and he says
[1:27:19] it's not like an arm Fallen offer that's
[1:27:21] doing it he said it's the part of God he
[1:27:22] says it's hard to explain
[1:27:25] which is God in another form
[1:27:29] Adam and Eve was God in another form
[1:27:36] and that never happened again until
[1:27:39] the real one came
[1:27:41] then he made a way for you and I to come
[1:27:44] to Salvation
[1:27:47] and that Christ in this church could
[1:27:49] stand up on Earth
[1:27:51] Christ and his pride
[1:27:54] not a male and female Holy Ghost that's
[1:27:57] stupidity
[1:27:59] if one Holy Ghost
[1:28:03] one eternal life
[1:28:05] the one brings a form
[1:28:09] of the man the other brings a form of
[1:28:11] the female to be Christ in the church
[1:28:18] what we got 596 I feel the poles
[1:28:23] anybody have a need the altar is open
[1:28:29] and I begin to cry
[1:28:37] and my mind just fails to know
[1:28:43] exactly why
[1:28:48] I can't explain
[1:28:50] we're tongue or been the spirits
[1:28:57] Within
[1:28:58] it must be God here in my soul cause I
[1:29:05] feel the poor
[1:29:10] feel the Satan's fighting he's fighting
[1:29:14] Wade over there I'm sure overseas aren't
[1:29:16] doing but then he jumps on the dunes
[1:29:18] need to try to run everything else
[1:29:20] messing it all up
[1:29:22] but you know what
[1:29:26] let's just believe
[1:29:29] and say all is well
[1:29:32] no matter what all is well
[1:29:35] he laid on brother Al's heart to think
[1:29:37] about that so
[1:29:39] let's take that as God and just believe
[1:29:41] all is well
[1:29:43] father Lord in the name of our Lord and
[1:29:46] Savior Jesus Christ thank you for
[1:29:49] putting it on our brother's heart about
[1:29:50] Wade in June and how Satan's fighting on
[1:29:53] every hand
[1:29:54] and Lord we know who's going to take
[1:29:57] care of everything because all is well
[1:30:00] we thank you Father
[1:30:03] we love you and we just commit
[1:30:05] everything into your hands and reach
[1:30:07] down to June Lord take away that old
[1:30:09] blood pressure problem yes Lord father
[1:30:12] thank you people to wait and take care
[1:30:14] of him
[1:30:15] we love you and we thank you Father
[1:30:20] thank you for loving us from Curry Farms
[1:30:23] thank you for putting it on our
[1:30:25] brother's heart about this
[1:30:28] Lord we believe that's you working
[1:30:30] through the body of Christ so we believe
[1:30:33] you father in Jesus name
[1:30:46] let's please father
[1:30:49] our little buddies got sinus problems
[1:30:52] that's bothering me they've bothered him
[1:30:54] a long time but they bothered him enough
[1:30:58] in the name of Jesus Christ we lay our
[1:31:01] hands upon our little buddy we believe
[1:31:04] you father
[1:31:05] and to say that by your stripes he's
[1:31:09] healed and we thank you in Jesus
[1:31:13] anybody else
[1:31:18] I lay in bed and I I begin to cry you
[1:31:24] ever do that
[1:31:30] let everything be taken care of
[1:31:35] I believe you father
[1:31:37] we believe all is well
[1:31:39] no matter what Satan does
[1:31:42] he can't conquer the Bride of Jesus
[1:31:46] Christ
[1:31:47] we ask you to just make manifest
[1:31:51] the Lord show our brother did all is
[1:31:54] well
[1:31:55] thank you Father
[1:31:57] all is well
[1:32:00] all is well
[1:32:08] knows each here is
[1:32:16] why because God says it is
[1:32:19] to me
[1:32:22] and I agree
[1:32:28] Lord please come and take control I feel
[1:32:38] do you feel that pool
[1:32:40] there's a pool in the last days trying
[1:32:42] to pull us to the right place in the
[1:32:44] word
[1:32:45] to bring us to that position to
[1:32:47] understand the prophet said when the
[1:32:49] bride realizes who she is and what she's
[1:32:51] here for Satan to be powerless before
[1:32:54] well why can't we just believe it
[1:32:58] I've never tried to tell you
[1:33:01] anything about where I am in God because
[1:33:04] I think that is uh beside the point
[1:33:10] it wouldn't help you if you believe me
[1:33:12] to be God himself standing in human
[1:33:14] flesh that wouldn't help you
[1:33:18] right
[1:33:21] it's trying to get you to believe
[1:33:24] that you're God in human flesh
[1:33:27] and then you can realize that Satan
[1:33:29] can't conquer you
[1:33:33] he don't understand it
[1:33:36] yeah but you people you think you're a
[1:33:38] God and look at it oh look at all that
[1:33:40] one okay
[1:33:45] just hang around oh boy
[1:33:47] things are going to work
[1:33:50] and are working
[1:33:52] that's my point my part my fighting has
[1:33:55] been one thing as we say oh look what
[1:33:58] was back there and look what's over here
[1:34:02] but we're not seeing what's here well if
[1:34:04] ain't something here it wasn't back
[1:34:06] there and it never will be over there
[1:34:09] all right
[1:34:12] so why don't we believe what's going on
[1:34:13] now
[1:34:15] and to say Thank you Lord
[1:34:17] yes thank you Lord we appreciate it
[1:34:22] Lord Jesus
[1:34:26] all we've tried to do is get your people
[1:34:28] to see about you Lord
[1:34:32] because if we can see you and see where
[1:34:34] you're at then we don't have no problems
[1:34:37] all is well
[1:34:39] no matter how bad things get in our
[1:34:41] lives
[1:34:43] how horrible they become
[1:34:45] all is well
[1:34:48] when things go all wrong
[1:34:51] it's for our benefit
[1:34:54] to try to bring us to a place to
[1:34:56] understand who we are
[1:34:58] and how then that we can take control
[1:35:01] of these things by faith in you Lord
[1:35:05] and cast that demon away
[1:35:09] Bless the people on the way home give
[1:35:11] everybody a safe journey we love you and
[1:35:12] we thank you in Jesus name
[1:35:15] you dismissed
[1:35:21] all ye Saints of Life Proclaim
[1:35:28] Jesus the light of the world
[1:35:34] life and mercy in his name
[1:35:41] Jesus the lighter
[1:35:47] we'll walk in the light
[1:35:51] Beautiful Life come when you do drops of
[1:35:58] mercy of bright shine all around us by
[1:36:04] day and by night
[1:36:07] Jesus the light of the world
[1:36:18] is called
