[2:50] and all forgive our sins
[2:52] lead us in jesus name amen
[2:58] all right now i want to read this whole
[3:00] or not to hold but i want to read over
[3:02] to the
[3:03] about the 16th 17th verse because i want
[3:06] you to get a point
[3:08] i told you back under that we would uh
[3:10] when we finished the series
[3:12] and we got on over to the uh covering
[3:16] predestination the brothers
[3:18] took over and they've covered a lot of
[3:20] of things about predestination and so
[3:23] we're
[3:23] we're laying it out in order i told you
[3:25] we would just get some
[3:26] little points maybe as a service or two
[3:30] and just take that point you know to uh
[3:33] uh instead of having a series thing uh
[3:37] we'll try to just do it in a
[3:38] message or two to get the thoughts and
[3:41] ideas
[3:43] of of what we need okay so let's just
[3:45] read from
[3:47] john 15. he said i am the true vine
[3:50] and my father is the husbandman every
[3:53] branch
[3:54] in me now remember who bears
[3:57] does the vine or do the brain our the
[4:00] branch is what bears
[4:02] the vines only supports the nutrients
[4:04] and things out to the
[4:06] you know bringing it to the branch and
[4:07] doing those things but remember that now
[4:10] all right every branch in me that
[4:12] beareth not fruit
[4:14] he taketh away and every brains that
[4:17] bear fruit
[4:19] he purges it that it may bring forth
[4:22] more fruit now you know purging is
[4:25] cutting off a lot of things that we
[4:28] don't need
[4:29] so that's what we've been dealing with
[4:31] is kind of in the day and talking last
[4:33] night in the
[4:34] the bible study had a marvelous time
[4:36] talking about
[4:37] you know the age and the time we're at
[4:39] the adoption
[4:41] the points of where that this age is the
[4:43] one age that's
[4:45] no other age has been responsible or
[4:47] anything for what we are
[4:49] because we're the winding up of all
[4:50] things okay now
[4:53] and you're clean through the word which
[4:56] i have spoken unto you
[4:58] abide in me and i knew as the branch
[5:01] cannot bear fruit
[5:03] of itself except it abide in the vine
[5:07] no man no more can ye accept you abide
[5:10] in me
[5:11] i am the vine you are the branches he
[5:14] that abideth in me
[5:16] and i in him the same bringeth forth
[5:19] much
[5:19] fruit for without me
[5:23] you can do nothing all right now
[5:25] remember
[5:27] you say well wait a minute you've
[5:29] emphasized the point
[5:31] john in your writing that the branch
[5:34] because they mentioned it about four or
[5:36] five times in these first
[5:38] four five verses talking about the
[5:39] brains to get you the idea the thought
[5:41] to point
[5:42] to who you are we are the branches he's
[5:44] the vine
[5:46] we're just the branches all right the
[5:49] branches is what brings forth the fruit
[5:51] though amen
[5:52] all right so then look at the importance
[5:55] of what he's talking about
[5:56] and he says i am the vine you are the
[5:59] branches
[6:00] he that abideth in me and i in him the
[6:03] same
[6:04] bringeth forth much fruit for without me
[6:07] you can do nothing now he's making his
[6:09] point right
[6:10] if a man abide not in me
[6:13] he is cast out a catch forth as a branch
[6:17] and is withered and men gather them and
[6:20] cast them into the fire
[6:22] and they're burned if you abide in me
[6:26] in my words abiding you you shall ask
[6:29] what you will
[6:30] and it shall be done unto you
[6:34] herein is my father glorified what
[6:38] that you buy much fruit all right so it
[6:40] takes some sometimes from
[6:42] chastening some whipping some uh
[6:45] cutting away the uh excess things off of
[6:48] the vines and the branches and things
[6:51] like that
[6:51] getting it lined up right as the father
[6:53] had loved me so
[6:55] have i loved you continue ye in
[6:58] my love if you keep my commandments
[7:01] you shall abide in my love even as i
[7:04] have kept my father's commandments
[7:06] and abide in his love these things have
[7:09] i spoken unto you
[7:11] that my joy might remain in you
[7:14] and that your joy might be full this is
[7:17] my commandment
[7:19] that if you love one another as i have
[7:21] loved you
[7:22] you know that you love one another
[7:25] greater love hath no man than this
[7:29] that a man lay down his life for his
[7:32] friends
[7:33] now watch he's changing his
[7:36] point
[7:39] okay watch watch the reading now because
[7:42] look at the word friends
[7:46] you're my friends
[7:50] no over here he calls you a branch
[7:55] now he calls you a friend
[8:00] listen to him but i have called you
[8:02] friends
[8:05] for all things that i have heard of my
[8:08] father
[8:09] have made known unto you
[8:13] you have not chosen me but i've chosen
[8:15] you
[8:16] and ordained you that you should go
[8:18] forth and bring forth
[8:20] fruit and that your fruit should be
[8:23] should remain
[8:24] that whatsoever you asked of the father
[8:27] in my name he may give it unto you this
[8:31] these things i command you that you
[8:34] love one another you may be seated the
[8:37] lord had his blessing
[8:38] to the reading of the word that's uh
[8:42] i was asked kind of last night you know
[8:44] how did i study how did i do sometimes
[8:46] see that's the way i like to do i like
[8:48] to read the bible
[8:49] and just follow through because here
[8:53] over in the beginning
[8:54] he's calling you a branch now he's
[8:56] calling your friend
[8:59] the greater things there because he's
[9:03] calling you a friend
[9:04] but remember now he said to judah's
[9:06] friend
[9:08] because judas was chosen
[9:12] he was in that job in that position
[9:15] place there that we were talking about
[9:17] last night of the gifts and the things
[9:20] and judas was called he called him
[9:22] friend
[9:25] the bible talks about abraham being what
[9:28] a friend of god see a friend is greater
[9:32] than than the branch
[9:34] you sometimes the branches what's doing
[9:36] but remember
[9:38] the branch without the vine
[9:42] there's no fruit all right so then you
[9:45] got to upgrade
[9:47] from your branch to you know a branch
[9:49] part to think about
[9:51] he's now calling you like he did abraham
[9:54] a friend
[9:56] great position for someone to say a
[9:58] friend
[9:59] you know i mean you you know you think
[10:02] about somebody
[10:03] in your life that has been your close
[10:06] friend
[10:08] you know somebody that's been close to
[10:11] you and been a friend to you
[10:14] see a friend would lay down his life for
[10:15] his brother
[10:18] you know because that's a friend
[10:21] all right see we need to keep that in
[10:24] mind now is what i'm trying to get to
[10:26] into the point but i want to not back up
[10:29] so far
[10:30] into what we've been talking about
[10:31] predestination as much
[10:34] as to taking the thought because it's
[10:36] been bearing on me to just
[10:38] uh maybe speak a little bit of where
[10:41] that jesus said there
[10:42] i've chosen you so you didn't choose me
[10:48] i chose you all right
[10:52] the bible covers through many things i
[10:54] chose you ordained you
[10:58] all right so we're going upward to from
[11:02] if you're understanding my point we're
[11:03] going from a branch
[11:07] because the branch is no good without
[11:08] the vine
[11:11] but the vine is not will not produce
[11:13] correctly
[11:15] or never will in the basis because it's
[11:17] the branch it produces
[11:19] so the vine must be there too and then
[11:22] now he's summing that up to come up to
[11:25] friendship that is uh a
[11:28] greater point of loving one another
[11:31] and being friends one to another that
[11:33] would give our life for each other
[11:36] as a friend amen all right
[11:39] now so what we want to talk about for a
[11:41] little bit now is one of the thoughts
[11:42] that we were covering in
[11:44] the series back before
[11:51] to sum up what jesus is saying
[11:56] coming from a branch
[12:00] to the vine and without means no good me
[12:02] without you
[12:04] and then coming to calling his friend
[12:07] all right so we can see that he would
[12:09] more easily choose a friend
[12:12] than to choose a branch or a vine or a
[12:15] thought like that
[12:17] because it's coming into the human race
[12:20] to talk about it
[12:21] but to sum up this point or thought
[12:26] how does god choose
[12:32] all right now how does he choose he's
[12:34] all he just picks in no
[12:35] no the prophet says he doesn't pick
[12:39] his desire is that everybody be saved
[12:42] all right he wished everybody would come
[12:45] to that place but he knows they won't
[12:47] so he's covered it here in a reading of
[12:49] this if the branch don't bear for
[12:52] fruit cut it off do it purge it okay
[12:55] it comes to the very age that we're
[12:57] living because adoption
[13:00] is cutting away the things that we do
[13:02] not need
[13:04] and bringing us to a place to where that
[13:06] we are the children of god
[13:08] amen being his offspring
[13:12] all right now and thinking about it how
[13:15] does god
[13:16] choose without being a respecter or a
[13:18] person
[13:20] without you thinking how could god do it
[13:22] without
[13:23] you know the human being say uh you know
[13:28] trying to figure that out and go the
[13:29] wrong way so how does god
[13:31] [Music]
[13:32] choose he choose like we do
[13:36] see we choose one thing today and
[13:37] tomorrow we'd you know we drive a
[13:40] uh uh a buick one day and then the next
[13:43] day we may
[13:44] be driving a cadillac the next day you
[13:46] know might be back down to a volkswagen
[13:49] because we're just making our choices
[13:50] over the natural thing
[13:52] all right we choose churches we go here
[13:55] we do that we go up and down we
[13:58] we do in choosing those churches we
[14:00] choose that by what
[14:02] we think is what would be the best part
[14:04] for our lives or thoughts
[14:06] all right but how does god
[14:10] choose
[14:13] without making him a respecter of person
[14:19] do you understand that yeah i just
[14:21] picked that thought up to
[14:22] they're doing it and and laid it aside
[14:24] during that series and just
[14:26] then well we'll come back to that
[14:29] all right but in summing up all that
[14:33] jesus said then he climaxes it by saying
[14:38] you didn't choose me
[14:41] i chose you
[14:45] all right now you said well but brother
[14:49] dale i've done this i've done that we
[14:50] can go through the lengthy series
[14:52] or whatever and thoughts when we did in
[14:54] that series of services and things
[14:57] we covered a lot about that
[15:00] god predestinates
[15:05] and how does he predestinate amen not by
[15:08] his desires
[15:11] not by what he he would want to be but
[15:14] what he predestinates by for
[15:18] knowledge all right
[15:21] now listen to what i'm talking about
[15:25] see if you approach for knowledge
[15:28] predestination choosing etc
[15:31] if you approach it in one direction
[15:33] you'll wind up being like
[15:35] a lot of the people of the message are
[15:37] you know i've got this born with this
[15:39] seed in me
[15:40] and and i always was eternal i don't
[15:43] need nothing else you know
[15:44] i'm i'm ready to go
[15:48] and they go most of the time they go
[15:50] after other doctrines or ideas and leave
[15:53] the message you know
[15:54] so they do some going with it but thing
[15:56] of it is
[15:57] see if you approach it on the wrong
[15:59] direction you'll come out wrong
[16:01] amen true that's right you'll come out
[16:04] with your own concept or thought or idea
[16:06] about it
[16:07] but if you preach approach it according
[16:09] to the word of god
[16:11] see keeping your scriptures close
[16:13] together and reading them
[16:16] and following it and like i said they're
[16:19] a while ago
[16:19] see see you say well how do you study so
[16:22] well i see long years ago
[16:24] i was preaching from romans 8 and and
[16:27] different ones in ephesians and
[16:29] preaching about predestination
[16:33] and in preaching those things you know i
[16:35] tried to emphasize so much
[16:38] to us that we would follow it that god
[16:41] predestinates by foreknowledge
[16:44] not by choice
[16:50] see then that way it's not you choosing
[16:52] him that's right
[16:53] right
[16:57] it's him choosing you now but we've got
[17:01] to keep when we've come to that side of
[17:03] the story
[17:04] we start another emphasis on the point
[17:06] right
[17:07] all right another thought
[17:11] you say then brother dale i chose god
[17:16] are you accepted right that's right
[17:19] choosing is a hard word because it
[17:22] covers a lot of things
[17:23] but you accepted what he done for you
[17:26] and you must do that but remember
[17:29] that he looked down through time and saw
[17:32] you
[17:33] would accept it if he offered it to you
[17:37] amen right right but he also
[17:41] saw judas's carrot which was chosen
[17:46] for the job and put into the position
[17:48] and and had the gifts and all of the
[17:50] things
[17:50] everything working in his life in a
[17:53] great thing
[17:55] right yet he turned down god
[18:02] make your calling an election the
[18:04] scripture says sure
[18:07] yeah in other words make sure you know
[18:09] what you're talking about you say yeah
[18:11] but brother dale
[18:12] them brothers can quote so much of this
[18:14] that will praise god
[18:17] but can you come back to one simple
[18:19] thing
[18:21] now this is the way i've been all my
[18:23] life for for
[18:25] 50 years ministering to you and i'm
[18:27] sorry not for ministering to you but for
[18:30] 50 years trying to get you to see
[18:31] something
[18:33] the more simple you make anything
[18:37] the better off it is right
[18:41] the more simple or simplified form
[18:44] aversion
[18:46] well see then we must approach then the
[18:48] fact of how does god choose by
[18:50] approaching it from a
[18:53] simple point that even a child can
[18:55] understand
[19:01] and see then uh your children you think
[19:04] well
[19:05] i chose to be who i am no you didn't now
[19:07] we have adoptions in the
[19:09] in the bases and all so you understand
[19:11] that part but
[19:12] that still you didn't have any choice
[19:15] you know
[19:16] remember kids you didn't have any choice
[19:21] he was born to dale
[19:25] he was born to fly bush
[19:31] he was born of robbers did you have any
[19:35] choice about your family that you were
[19:39] allowed to come into
[19:41] no right
[19:44] now other than the fact of adoption or
[19:46] bringing into that way you know okay we
[19:48] can pick up that part
[19:49] but still remember that it's the parents
[19:52] that are doing the choosing
[19:54] even if it's in adoption it's not you
[19:57] going into the adoption agency and
[19:59] applying for
[20:00] parents right
[20:07] it's the parents going in and applying
[20:08] for you
[20:10] so now we got it simple leave it up to
[20:13] the parents
[20:15] and now then kids you can blame your mom
[20:16] and daddy for everything in the world
[20:20] every time anything goes wrong you say
[20:21] well you made me
[20:24] you chose me like this
[20:28] you say no i didn't choose you like that
[20:30] and i tried to
[20:32] correct you through the time to get you
[20:34] to not come out to be
[20:36] right but evidently i didn't apply the
[20:39] right rule
[20:40] you know or ruler you know in doing
[20:44] that much and because today they you
[20:47] know they say you can whip your child
[20:49] with a
[20:50] belt or a fat and like that but you
[20:52] can't do it with a stick
[20:54] i i never did understand it it's just
[20:57] getting the attention of the child
[20:58] anyway
[20:59] but listen now
[21:03] but how does god choose without it being
[21:06] a respecter of persons
[21:12] and the thing formed
[21:15] me paul says can't say
[21:18] why did you form me this way
[21:22] because god never formed us wrong
[21:29] he formed us correctly
[21:32] we chose the wrong thing amen
[21:36] well i can't help to be what i am i'm
[21:38] just born this way no
[21:40] no you wasn't born that way
[21:46] you become that away
[21:49] all right by your own choosing
[21:53] so then is it that god chooses us
[21:56] without us choosing
[21:57] no when he chooses us
[22:00] we must accept the fact of him choosing
[22:03] us
[22:05] and agree to the stipulations or the
[22:07] points or parts
[22:09] of that choice or the the thing of
[22:12] coming into the family
[22:15] so then see he can he can choose
[22:19] by his foreknowledge he knows exactly
[22:23] what you and i will do that's right
[22:30] well why didn't he stop me from doing it
[22:32] that would be the
[22:33] opposite side of the story now
[22:36] you're gonna start trying to blame him
[22:38] for those things
[22:40] because there is something about this
[22:42] situation
[22:43] see by you accepting jesus christ as
[22:45] your savior
[22:46] you made a choice okay
[22:50] you made a choice you chose for him to
[22:53] be
[22:54] your savior amen well no he made it for
[22:57] me because that's what you're saying no
[22:59] no
[23:03] because remember when he was talking to
[23:05] the disciples
[23:07] in this illustration here in john he was
[23:10] also speaking to judas's character
[23:13] amen
[23:17] he chose judas iscariot amen
[23:20] he justified him to him believing on him
[23:25] he sanctified him in saint john 17.
[23:28] that's who he's talking to here
[23:29] judas was right in this group and he
[23:32] sanctified him
[23:34] he set him aside cleansed him
[23:38] all right see it's not a poor old judas
[23:42] attitude you know
[23:43] well he didn't know no he had the same
[23:46] position
[23:48] that the disciples had all of them had
[23:50] the same situation
[23:54] so judas was chosen of god
[23:58] but what happened
[24:02] what happened to the story
[24:07] when some of the others went through
[24:09] more horrible
[24:11] ways or doings and things than maybe
[24:13] judas ever
[24:15] had to go through
[24:20] see then you can't make his choosing
[24:23] be hand picking
[24:28] you can't have that he said okay
[24:32] i'm going to put judas in here but then
[24:34] i'm going to throw him out
[24:36] no judas chose god
[24:44] now we're getting a little bit different
[24:46] on choosing than our thoughts maybe
[24:47] sometimes is letting us run
[24:50] judas chose god chose him he chose god
[24:56] he chose him through justification to
[24:58] follow him
[24:59] and to believe him he had gifts he had
[25:01] the signs and wonders of the apostles
[25:06] and all of those things but yet what
[25:09] happened in the end of all things
[25:12] at the state of sanctification then you
[25:14] have to put everybody at the same
[25:17] all of the disciples see we won't deal
[25:20] with every person
[25:21] but the 12.
[25:24] all 12 of them stood in the same place
[25:30] picture of god for a job
[25:35] ordained for that anointed for that
[25:38] amen and judas just as present
[25:43] it's the rest of them
[25:48] god never goofed up in choosing
[25:54] but there's a simple little way of
[25:55] keeping predestination straight and
[25:57] fornotted
[25:58] just remember foreknowledge is knowledge
[26:01] before
[26:04] is that simple enough knowledge before
[26:07] anything
[26:08] takes place is for knowledge
[26:12] and remember it was for knowledge that
[26:14] put it to the basis
[26:16] that even before the foundation of the
[26:18] world the bible tells you that jesus
[26:20] christ stood as a lamb
[26:22] slain
[26:25] and when he was chosen for that position
[26:28] you know what you were chosen right
[26:29] there in him
[26:30] because that's what it says chosen in
[26:32] him we'll get to that in a minute in
[26:33] ephesians
[26:35] chosen in him we were chosen of him but
[26:39] remember judas
[26:40] could be into that position of being
[26:42] chosen of him
[26:45] but when it become to the analyses or
[26:48] what you'd call it the finality of it
[26:49] all
[26:50] whose problem was it
[26:54] did god turn down judas did he give him
[26:57] something
[26:58] that was beyond
[27:01] the point that he could abide by it and
[27:04] but yet he didn't do with the other
[27:05] disciples you know did he do something
[27:06] like that no
[27:07] that would be something according to his
[27:09] desires and he desires that all man be
[27:12] saved
[27:15] he desired that judas is carrot be saved
[27:21] he called him friend
[27:24] friend why have you come to betray me
[27:29] see we don't look at it in the right
[27:31] order we look at
[27:33] cain and abel you know a situation or
[27:35] something like that
[27:36] but just remember cain was offered
[27:39] the same thing that abel was offered
[27:47] cain then was chosen of god as much as
[27:50] abel was in the basis
[27:52] of election
[27:56] and what was to take place see the
[27:59] people this message you heard a lot of
[28:01] people
[28:01] oh but cain he didn't know cain had a
[28:03] choice that the bible said
[28:05] if you would have been chosen if you'd
[28:07] have done like your brother
[28:09] in other words he just said go and do it
[28:10] now
[28:12] understand if he was telling him how the
[28:14] brother got to that position
[28:16] he was telling him you're going to do
[28:17] right now he wasn't saying you have done
[28:19] and you're doomed because you didn't do
[28:22] right
[28:23] no he's telling him go right now
[28:28] go right now and do what your brother
[28:30] done
[28:31] and you'll be accepted right
[28:35] because that way is god putting forth
[28:38] the choice
[28:39] but knowing the choice that's right
[28:42] for knowledge that before the world ever
[28:45] begun
[28:46] god knew every person that would ever
[28:48] come into this world
[28:52] and what our choices would be
[28:56] right everybody
[29:00] but he has to put it before everybody
[29:01] the same yes
[29:04] what's the difference between the
[29:06] foolish virgins and the virgins
[29:08] that's right
[29:14] at one stage of the journey until the
[29:17] day of pentecost
[29:19] you didn't have 12 uh 10 virgins
[29:22] right now i hope you follow this point
[29:24] and
[29:25] you didn't have five wives and five
[29:28] foolish until you come
[29:29] into the new testament because see
[29:31] that's where we miss it
[29:33] if we get the point that the salvation
[29:35] was not in the old testament in the form
[29:37] to were
[29:38] that it could bring you forth and and
[29:40] bring you into the right position
[29:42] salvation came through jesus christ upon
[29:45] calvary
[29:47] see then develop the idea or form to
[29:49] where that you could have
[29:50] five wise and five foolish because
[29:52] what's the five wives
[29:54] those that have the baptism of the holy
[29:56] ghost they couldn't have had the baptism
[29:58] in the holy ghost if jesus christ hadn't
[29:59] died so it's all based upon that
[30:01] amen right so it's a time of calvary
[30:05] until they made their choice
[30:08] god's choice was the same for the
[30:10] foolish and the wives
[30:14] he desired that they both be saved
[30:18] i'm just picking up scriptures to make
[30:20] you think in the simplified form of
[30:23] thinking about
[30:25] you know what has happened
[30:30] did god look down through and see you as
[30:32] a goody-goody
[30:35] and say well i like that you know i'll
[30:37] choose that one but i'll reject this one
[30:39] over here
[30:40] you're going to wind up in trouble
[30:41] because you're going to get into east on
[30:43] jacob
[30:44] and you're going to find out in in jacob
[30:47] that he's a shyster
[30:49] and you're going to find out that a lot
[30:50] of esau is doing was better than what
[30:52] jacob done
[30:53] right now you've got to get that
[30:55] involved
[31:00] but it's all involved in one thing
[31:04] god foreknew all things
[31:08] amen he could say to the prophets back
[31:12] there
[31:13] even in jeremiah and him and say i knew
[31:15] you ordained you
[31:18] before the world ever begun amen when
[31:21] was the choosing and the rejecting
[31:26] see that's why jesus christ why did
[31:28] jesus christ have to die before the
[31:29] foundation in the world
[31:31] why wouldn't it have been in time that
[31:32] he would come to
[31:34] we know he did physically in time oh we
[31:37] know that
[31:38] but what would be the emphasis of the
[31:40] bible talking about it
[31:41] the bible speaks of it like the more
[31:43] emphasis is placed upon
[31:45] that before the foundation of the world
[31:48] god would know all things
[31:52] and then he wouldn't have to write down
[31:55] a book
[31:56] he just let you live it
[32:01] there ain't going to be a whole bunch of
[32:02] books when we get there and those things
[32:03] where it says books you know in
[32:05] revelation we talked about the other day
[32:06] uh you know no no it's all become we're
[32:10] going to be computerized
[32:12] right you know it's going to be set up
[32:15] on that basis that the whole thing will
[32:16] go
[32:20] and he can see everything about us
[32:24] and know everything but i've tried to
[32:27] get you to understand one thing
[32:29] i know i'm crazy in the way i think but
[32:31] you realize you go back as far as you
[32:33] can go
[32:36] and that's for knowledge
[32:40] for knowledge is as far as you can go
[32:43] all right that's why the prophet
[32:45] emphasized that we were not back there
[32:47] as
[32:47] beings people etcetera we was in his
[32:50] mind
[32:52] not as identities of people or thoughts
[32:55] we
[32:56] we were not in that we were in his mind
[33:00] all right so then the mind goes back so
[33:03] far
[33:03] until we won't have no court of appeal
[33:08] when we get there because it won't be
[33:12] that he said well i
[33:13] you know i i know i realized i've done
[33:15] you wrong jacob i i mean he saw i've
[33:17] done you a little wrong order or
[33:18] done this out of the other when you know
[33:20] i can preach your sermon on jacob and
[33:22] esau
[33:23] and show you that it looked like god did
[33:25] have favoritism and
[33:29] in jacob
[33:33] you know it kind of looked like he
[33:34] favored him just a little
[33:38] you know what he did now then
[33:41] you have to stop and think right how
[33:44] could he have a
[33:45] favoritism to jacob
[33:49] and it not be something of his desire
[33:53] could it be that he
[33:56] was looking at what each one of us
[33:59] would do could it be there's the
[34:04] foreknowledge
[34:08] could it be that he could see
[34:11] right what it would be and then all he's
[34:14] got to do
[34:15] is just lay it out and let it transpire
[34:21] and he just comes by and
[34:24] drops a little meal is that uh uh
[34:27] ruth and boaz come by and just drop a
[34:30] little extra meal
[34:32] and you just reach down and pick that up
[34:33] and you oh you have a good time
[34:36] and he says what there's more than just
[34:38] keep following the ones that's dropping
[34:40] it
[34:41] he goes to them and says drop a little x
[34:43] tree for them
[34:44] is that now what you're thinking about
[34:48] the choosing of a
[34:50] of uh jacob over esau
[34:58] what if it is folks
[35:03] that jacob loved
[35:06] god
[35:11] i proved it to you back there in the
[35:12] series time we were talking about
[35:14] abraham
[35:16] abraham was called a friend of god
[35:19] abraham loved god
[35:22] david loved god that no matter what took
[35:26] place or what happened to the life of
[35:28] david
[35:29] you know he would come right back and
[35:32] fall on his knees
[35:34] and cry out to a living god
[35:38] and god would just drop down and say
[35:41] that's a man after my own heart
[35:45] that's hard to explain because you say
[35:47] one can jump up and say well what about
[35:49] david's adulterer and murder this out of
[35:51] the other is that after god's own heart
[35:54] no no what's the love
[36:05] see we had a choice in who we was to
[36:07] marry in things or something like that
[36:10] or a job as we worked at
[36:11] we know those things have been a choice
[36:16] but see when i when i asked peggy to
[36:19] accept me as
[36:22] and i would never nobody in that room i
[36:25] tell you
[36:26] do not play with your little jitty jaddy
[36:28] kids words
[36:29] don't don't talk to somebody on the
[36:33] serious matter of
[36:34] marriages and things until you get a lot
[36:36] of emphasis
[36:37] or a lot of help by somebody else kids
[36:41] don't just go out and say oh yeah i'll
[36:42] marry you
[36:43] oh yeah i love you talks cheap
[36:47] right right but it can get you in
[36:49] trouble
[36:52] you don't realize it gets you in trouble
[36:53] because by your words to be justified by
[36:55] your words will be condemned
[37:00] so be careful how you use your words
[37:04] don't be cheap about it david wasn't on
[37:06] my point david wasn't being cheap about
[37:08] his love for god
[37:09] david loved god amen
[37:15] no matter what god would turn and do to
[37:17] david david just
[37:18] the lord i love you
[37:23] abraham a friend of god moses
[37:28] lipped to ear as never to any man
[37:32] that was ever made talked like that
[37:36] lift the ear that moses
[37:39] talked to god god loved him
[37:45] that's what i said about the fruit
[37:47] sometimes you have to cut the limb off
[37:49] sometimes you have to prune this and do
[37:50] that
[37:52] and that's what he had to do to mankind
[37:54] he had to do those things to keep us
[37:55] from being
[37:56] he had to whip david
[38:01] and sometimes you remember that one time
[38:03] somebody was preaching about this
[38:04] recently here
[38:05] uh you know one time david he god had
[38:09] just laid it out in front of him now do
[38:10] you want to do this
[38:12] do you want to be in the presence of
[38:14] your enemies
[38:16] for so many days you want to lose this
[38:17] you want the plagues to come you want
[38:19] what to do
[38:20] and david looked at him and says
[38:24] i want to be left in the hands of my god
[38:31] that's paraphrasing it was close enough
[38:35] he said i want to be in the hands of my
[38:37] god
[38:38] you know what it cost him thousands of
[38:40] lives
[38:45] but he'd rather do that and lose half of
[38:47] his army
[38:48] than to go with some idea or some point
[38:52] of his own of his own desires
[38:53] and wind up and not lose nobody
[39:00] you understand what i'm getting at
[39:05] how does god choose without
[39:08] being a respecter of persons
[39:15] how is it that he can choose without
[39:17] being a respecter
[39:19] it's simple if you look at it correctly
[39:21] he looked all the way down through and
[39:23] see exactly everything we do
[39:25] he knows what you're going to do he
[39:28] knows the choice you're going to make
[39:32] well you know what he just has it ready
[39:33] for you
[39:36] amen but he knows what everybody will
[39:40] choose
[39:44] then the fact of us choosing him the
[39:47] prophet was not and the bible is not
[39:49] saying it when it says
[39:51] you didn't choose me i cho you didn't
[39:53] dream i chose you
[39:54] and then come over to brother branham
[39:57] and brother brown and give you emphasis
[39:58] over and over and over
[40:00] about the the doings of of choosing and
[40:02] all like that
[40:03] and you didn't choose him he chose you
[40:07] you it looks like if you could preach
[40:09] that you could actually wind up with a
[40:11] good
[40:12] uh mixed-up denomination but a situation
[40:15] would exist that you'd blame god for
[40:17] everything
[40:19] because remember if you can blame him
[40:21] for everything you're in trouble
[40:26] who'd want a god that you could blame
[40:27] him for everything and get by with it
[40:29] oh that'd be nice no it wouldn't
[40:36] i don't want to blame god for my doings
[40:39] i don't even blame the devil for my
[40:40] actions
[40:43] you don't hear me saying the devil made
[40:45] me do it
[40:50] i'm the devil itself if you want to take
[40:52] it that way
[40:53] because it's not going to be on the
[40:55] basis that you can blame the the devil
[40:57] even for your doing
[40:58] sure we know what it is we know what the
[41:00] devil does and how he comes through and
[41:02] how he lives through life
[41:03] and what he does with our lives and how
[41:05] he perverts us and
[41:06] and things because even in the garden
[41:09] see
[41:09] satan it's hard for to understand what
[41:12] the prophet is talking about but he says
[41:14] that satan was
[41:15] the the designer of eve in the garden
[41:22] huh anybody want to take that one
[41:25] satan's a designer you mean
[41:27] he made her like that no he didn't make
[41:31] her like that god made her like that
[41:34] now then you're on to me about it right
[41:39] god didn't make eve do the wrong
[41:42] he knew what she would do
[41:46] he didn't make us go wrong in sin but he
[41:49] knew
[41:49] his immediate lift turning us loose that
[41:51] it would go
[41:52] to that basis all right
[41:58] see you can't pull anything over on god
[42:03] so quit trying to quit trying to blame
[42:06] somebody else or what you're doing and
[42:07] just blame yourself
[42:11] cry out for deliverance and say lord
[42:13] help me
[42:22] see we've come in this stage until we're
[42:24] through the
[42:25] and we're talking about life not about
[42:27] it we're at the age of adoption
[42:29] that no age faced this age
[42:34] in what it's doing while they
[42:38] down through their brother delay was
[42:39] killed by the millions they was given
[42:43] a whole lot easier than trying to live
[42:47] now and do right
[42:50] what well
[42:54] are you listening
[42:58] what about all of these these heartaches
[43:00] and troubles that are coming upon us
[43:02] and what about when you finalize it the
[43:04] bible says
[43:05] i sent these things among you to try you
[43:10] i sent them he said amen amen
[43:16] i allowed these things to happen all of
[43:18] these
[43:19] things i've got the book sister lonely
[43:21] of
[43:22] of people with those viruses and and
[43:24] over the past
[43:25] uh hundred years there's been um
[43:28] something in the neighborhood of
[43:30] 500 million or billion people there's
[43:33] some big outstanding number
[43:34] that have died in all of these viruses
[43:36] and things some of them had two and
[43:38] three hundred thousand people
[43:41] we're not in nothing today compared to
[43:43] what some of those viruses took
[43:46] and are still taking all right
[43:51] but listen to what i'm talking about
[43:54] god doesn't pick and choose the way we
[43:57] do get it all out of our mind of
[43:59] understanding of how god does things
[44:01] and think about how simple it is
[44:08] i had nothing to do with the way it
[44:10] turned out to be left-handed
[44:12] piggy had nothing to do with that
[44:16] oh you can call it a genetic what
[44:18] genetic felt it and what terence didn't
[44:19] turn out left-handed
[44:24] i mean you know you say well i'll blame
[44:26] it on this lane no no no
[44:28] just get it to the bases but remember
[44:31] we're serving the god that knows
[44:34] everything
[44:35] amen he knew before the world ever begun
[44:38] ever nap that would ever be in the world
[44:40] and how many times it would bat its eye
[44:43] now that's
[44:44] infinite amen
[44:49] but he knew that amen
[44:52] so then it would be very easy to just
[44:54] watch it take place
[44:57] create mankind
[45:00] make him not wrong make him perfect
[45:03] not eternal come on there's a difference
[45:05] in the word
[45:06] make him perfect adam and eve were made
[45:10] perfect
[45:11] right they were given
[45:15] the the eternal life in their soul
[45:20] that's how close to perfection it would
[45:22] come out to be
[45:24] well yet they would still do wrong
[45:28] that's why you don't hear that among the
[45:30] preachers of the message because they
[45:31] can't handle
[45:32] that what do you mean well adam and eve
[45:34] according to brother random one
[45:35] blasphemy's name adam and eve had
[45:36] eternal life in the garden
[45:38] in their soul not in their body not in
[45:40] their spirit that's right
[45:42] go read the book and come back and tell
[45:44] me
[45:46] well i don't believe it that's what i
[45:47] mean you ain't going to do it you're
[45:49] going to prove what you are
[45:50] by doing that well don't you think god
[45:51] knew what she was going to do
[45:55] amen you know in school they told us to
[45:58] read certain books
[46:01] i enjoyed reading but i didn't enjoy
[46:04] making bookmarks my book works there
[46:06] what you call it you know
[46:07] i didn't enjoy having to write those
[46:08] stories you know they'd assign you a
[46:11] book and tell you want to write a story
[46:12] about it
[46:15] well first off i just wind up and give
[46:17] my dog my sister
[46:18] my uh book and tell her to make me a
[46:21] book report
[46:23] that done pretty good on that until one
[46:25] day i forgot
[46:26] and you know how you had to turn the
[46:28] notes in and i forgot and turned in my
[46:31] sister's notes
[46:34] on the book the teacher found out what i
[46:36] was doing
[46:37] you know all right but i'm like this too
[46:41] i really i've always been the one
[46:43] that i enjoy reading i enjoy
[46:47] getting into something and reading this
[46:49] a lot of people are not made that away
[46:52] this is for some reason but some people
[46:54] just made to the basis
[46:55] oh uh zane gray or what his name was the
[46:58] one that wrote all of the
[46:59] western movies back you know and all the
[47:02] things that wrote all the books about
[47:03] him and everything
[47:04] i enjoyed that i could get right in
[47:06] there and just be right in there with
[47:08] him
[47:08] pulling guns and just shooting because i
[47:11] could read it and become a part of it
[47:16] you know what that's what i do about the
[47:18] bible
[47:20] i love to read it and read me living
[47:25] there
[47:30] that's why i emphasize so much to you
[47:31] lately what last year or so
[47:34] church it's this is a personal
[47:37] thing
[47:40] something personal between you and god
[47:43] amen he wants you to see who you are
[47:49] what you're doing here but he saw you
[47:52] before the world
[47:57] get away from the peeking and choosing
[47:59] of how good it is but get down to the
[48:01] bases that
[48:02] what if you could just look over the
[48:03] building today
[48:05] and just see everybody's thoughts and
[48:07] ideas
[48:08] you know that's why i don't want to be a
[48:10] prophet that wouldn't work with me i'd
[48:12] go crazy to the bad
[48:13] it's bad enough as it did but to just
[48:16] look out across the congregation
[48:18] being able to tell you all your thoughts
[48:23] you say oh i'd love to do it no no
[48:28] no
[48:31] brother branham said you don't feel a
[48:33] knife sticking in his back
[48:35] that was his friend
[48:39] i wouldn't want to do that
[48:43] but you know what to be able to live our
[48:45] lives together
[48:46] that's been a wonderful thing to me
[48:52] my wife and i have been together 50 what
[48:53] one two years or when are we going
[48:55] 62. well how many we i don't even know
[48:58] we're getting
[48:59] all this mess it up but 62 years
[49:05] her daddy told me something i told the
[49:07] kids about it or
[49:08] told richard them about it the other day
[49:10] that i've never told anybody
[49:11] of what her daddy said
[49:16] daddy said to me one day he said sam
[49:19] he said peggy is a good little girl
[49:22] i'd ask him to marry her you know and
[49:24] everything because that's always that
[49:26] way
[49:26] i think your boys ought to go to the
[49:28] parents and ask the parents
[49:30] can you marry their children i i believe
[49:32] in that
[49:34] and i went to talk to him and said well
[49:36] you know ask his permission
[49:38] he said she's a good girl said she'll
[49:40] blow her stack
[49:43] said she'll become
[49:47] you know a little irritated with you
[49:51] but he said in about 30 minutes she'll
[49:54] be over it
[50:00] well you know what i know that
[50:04] so she blows her stack sometimes a house
[50:09] i said okay 30 minutes i got to find
[50:11] something to do
[50:16] but the problem is see i blow my stack
[50:18] and ain't no 30 minutes to get over it
[50:20] you understand
[50:22] it takes me a week or two or all right
[50:24] to get over my parts you know to get it
[50:26] settled out
[50:27] but if you'll pay attention to kids
[50:30] especially to
[50:31] mom you'll find that trait is there
[50:35] that she'll be upset with you
[50:38] but about five minutes all you gotta do
[50:40] is say mom you're gonna have some
[50:42] biscuits ready for supper
[50:47] okay
[50:50] she'll be up cooking biscuits even
[50:51] though she don't feel like it
[50:55] but see that's a trait that's a thought
[50:56] or an idea
[50:58] the reason to that point is to think
[51:00] about god
[51:06] what about a god that could look all the
[51:07] way down through time
[51:14] what about a guard that could do that
[51:15] don't you think he gets upset with us a
[51:17] lot
[51:19] he said god getting upset don't you
[51:21] think he gets upset of us a lot of
[51:22] things
[51:23] in our lives every day maybe
[51:27] i think he does
[51:31] but there's always been one thing that
[51:33] my wife knows i've told her
[51:36] i said no matter what i do or say or
[51:38] think
[51:42] don't take that as the final point
[51:46] wait a day or two and look at the
[51:48] situation
[51:50] my point was i wouldn't mind her having
[51:53] total
[51:54] uh ability to know all of my thoughts
[51:58] now this is going to be contrary to a
[52:00] lot of people because a lot of people
[52:00] don't want you to know their thoughts
[52:03] because they keep secret themselves by
[52:05] not letting out their thoughts
[52:06] well see i'm not that way to you i'm
[52:08] that away
[52:13] as long as you get my life's thought
[52:18] because my life's thought's going to be
[52:20] the good one
[52:23] i'm going to have bad thoughts but i'm
[52:25] going to get over it
[52:30] right and i'm going to be
[52:34] anchored into that and there's no
[52:36] problem what are you talking about
[52:38] god for knew ever move everything we do
[52:43] and you know what he looked out of us
[52:45] living it all the way down through
[52:47] and didn't get mad and throw us away
[52:52] right we're down here at the end of all
[52:55] things and i'm glad of it
[52:58] at the end of all things you're going to
[52:59] know all things and you're going to see
[53:00] then and all of it is right
[53:02] right all things that are wrong will be
[53:05] made right that's why there is a
[53:07] judgment seat of christ
[53:10] not a white throne judgment for you to
[53:11] have to go to the bride does not go to
[53:13] that
[53:14] but she has to have the judgment seat of
[53:16] christ
[53:18] to give an account of the deeds done in
[53:19] the body whether good or bad
[53:23] it is not a decision of eternal life to
[53:25] decide whether or not you're going to
[53:27] heaven
[53:28] but it is the fact that we went through
[53:30] life and done those things
[53:31] and those things have got to be cleared
[53:32] out that's what i'm talking about and
[53:34] why i believe it's so here
[53:35] because right here's a way to do and get
[53:37] rid of all of our
[53:38] our little troubles and heartaches and
[53:40] problems and things
[53:43] and come out of it where the bible says
[53:46] the judgments
[53:47] it begins at the house of the lord
[53:52] we're on a day that it can be made
[53:54] possible to get rid of all of our wrongs
[53:59] will you ever come to a place that you
[54:01] won't have a wrong thought i didn't say
[54:02] that i said get rid of my wrongs
[54:05] i'll always have my problems
[54:08] but i won't be blaming everybody else
[54:12] i'll accept it on the basis and keep it
[54:14] to work that i can say this is me
[54:21] why because that's the way god chooses
[54:27] he had a world full of people for some
[54:30] reason
[54:31] he chose twelve
[54:39] he had a world full of people one one
[54:41] time he chose a little virgin to have a
[54:43] child
[54:50] could it be that he could sit down and
[54:52] look and see
[54:53] things that we are going through life
[54:56] and to see it
[54:57] that we could go different and him still
[54:59] know what we're doing
[55:01] you don't believe god that way i know
[55:02] you don't because i've tried to explain
[55:04] it
[55:07] i've tried to explain to one thing of
[55:08] god that he could know
[55:10] anything even though it would go the
[55:11] opposite direction
[55:16] he would still know where the right or
[55:18] wrong of it is that's right
[55:22] well because he's god don't never do
[55:25] away with an infinite god that could
[55:26] know everything
[55:28] because that's what he's doing what is
[55:30] it how does god predestinate brother
[55:32] branham
[55:33] buy for knowledge
[55:38] because he could look all the way back
[55:41] before the eternities ever started and
[55:44] see everything that would go all the way
[55:45] through and wind up with all being made
[55:47] eternal
[55:48] in the future home and all of the things
[55:54] he's god he can do all of those things
[55:57] nothing is hidden from him
[56:00] but like i said down through that time
[56:02] he would see us mess up and do
[56:06] but he'd see us go and cry
[56:09] that's what i say about david that's why
[56:10] he was a man there for me
[56:13] he'd go out and do wrong but yet you'd
[56:14] see him repent
[56:16] he'd go cry out to god
[56:21] god said okay david i'm gonna have to
[56:24] whip you
[56:26] you ever done this with your kids you
[56:29] ever told your kids that
[56:30] it's going to hurt you more than it does
[56:32] then for you to whip them
[56:36] you ever done that i mean really told
[56:37] god you know
[56:39] or told you your parents told your
[56:42] your children let me write it
[56:45] this is going to hurt me more than it
[56:47] does you
[56:51] well see that the kids i know they
[56:53] didn't understand it so one day they was
[56:55] at the house
[56:56] and the kids got to acting up you know
[56:58] the grandkids to us and they got they're
[57:00] doing wrong and doing that in the other
[57:02] and they was trying to get them straight
[57:04] down about time they'd get this straight
[57:05] and i need to be over here in this crowd
[57:07] not tell them get that straight and be
[57:08] back over here they was having problems
[57:10] there's kids you know i looked over at
[57:13] them started laughing i said now y'all
[57:15] know what i'm talking about
[57:17] then when i used to try to tell you that
[57:18] it hurt me more to whoop you than it did
[57:20] for you to get whipped
[57:22] let's take care of them you know make a
[57:24] mind
[57:32] don't you think god sometimes looks down
[57:35] and kind of laughs
[57:41] and he said you know what
[57:44] old brother john duret he's let me pick
[57:47] on him a little
[57:49] let me give him back trouble
[57:53] you mean god gave it to him well where
[57:54] to get it
[57:57] come on that's a perfect man are we in
[57:59] the message
[58:02] god puts those things on there to try to
[58:04] bring us to a position
[58:11] he lets things come among us look at all
[58:13] these viruses and the different things
[58:16] but you know what i'm going to say this
[58:18] one time i mentioned it but i'm going to
[58:21] say it this way
[58:24] the virus didn't change a lot of people
[58:29] you just think about it a lot of the
[58:32] people that were not steady
[58:34] and coming to church they didn't come
[58:36] regular they do
[58:37] it's the same people when the virus
[58:39] comes they didn't come regular
[58:41] but they're already doing that right
[58:45] they're already laying out and coming
[58:46] when they wanted to and doing what they
[58:48] wanted to do
[58:50] the virus didn't change the thing it
[58:53] gave you a reason
[58:56] gave you something to lie about because
[58:58] you got problems
[59:03] right that's right he didn't pull down
[59:06] over on god
[59:08] what if this is the point that what he
[59:10] brought to straighten us out amen
[59:13] amen well how did we work how did we do
[59:18] i failed i don't know about you
[59:22] i figure i failed totally right
[59:26] because of me
[59:29] but listen god knows every move
[59:33] everything you'll ever do
[59:34] so don't worry about it worry about the
[59:37] end point of what i'm talking about
[59:39] right i was expressing that a minute at
[59:42] the end of all things
[59:49] think about it that god has allowed us
[59:53] to live and to bring us the
[59:59] of the truth of god
[1:00:03] that sometimes he'd have to whip us to
[1:00:06] get us to line up
[1:00:07] well that's not a loving god
[1:00:11] if he loved me that's what's wrong with
[1:00:14] me and you
[1:00:15] a dodie granddaddy grandma they pet them
[1:00:18] kids you know and
[1:00:24] huh we love them we want to do it right
[1:00:29] but sometimes god has to put things on
[1:00:31] us to get us to line up that's right
[1:00:38] but do we think of it that way now i'm
[1:00:39] just getting it
[1:00:44] god's foreknowledge the prophet said he
[1:00:48] knew
[1:00:48] that by making mankind mankind would
[1:00:54] fall now how did he know that
[1:01:01] how did he know mankind would fall
[1:01:06] because he'd already seen it
[1:01:10] he seen all he had to do is create man
[1:01:13] give man a choice and we'd automatically
[1:01:15] fall
[1:01:16] that's right amen that makes god the
[1:01:20] author of sin no it doesn't make him
[1:01:22] authorism
[1:01:23] makes him the god of eternal life
[1:01:29] because he knew what choice was mine but
[1:01:30] see he also knows the choice what we do
[1:01:37] he knows exactly how far he can push you
[1:01:42] he knows exactly how much punishment he
[1:01:44] can place upon each one of us
[1:01:47] you see mean god punishing us well
[1:01:51] let's use another word just to get you
[1:01:53] off the hook
[1:01:54] let's use the word try yeah
[1:01:58] god knows how much he can put on and try
[1:02:02] us because he knows where we're going to
[1:02:05] blow the stack
[1:02:17] but do you know the point yourself how
[1:02:19] far you can go
[1:02:23] have we fallen in love with god enough
[1:02:25] to realize
[1:02:26] that no matter what he does
[1:02:30] he's my daddy
[1:02:34] he's my father
[1:02:39] i talked to him like that
[1:02:44] now tell him i said father sometimes you
[1:02:47] know
[1:02:48] that i didn't know my daddy because he
[1:02:49] died when i was
[1:02:51] four years old i never got to know him
[1:02:53] very much
[1:02:56] but to think that you would give me an
[1:02:58] opportunity
[1:03:00] to be able to just if nothing else if i
[1:03:02] die and go to hell
[1:03:04] give me an opportunity to study thy word
[1:03:10] and study it from a prophet's view of
[1:03:13] the word
[1:03:14] how would you say it or or god's view of
[1:03:16] it
[1:03:17] instead of our own views we had our own
[1:03:20] views we sat down in the baptist
[1:03:21] we talked about things in the baptist
[1:03:24] i've heard adoption preached in the
[1:03:25] baptist
[1:03:26] see a lot of you you can't say the
[1:03:29] things that i can't
[1:03:30] i've seen a lot of things that was
[1:03:31] preached there i heard
[1:03:33] of of the old doctrine that
[1:03:36] man didn't even have a soul until
[1:03:40] the giving of the law i heard those
[1:03:42] things in the baptist church
[1:03:47] you never heard doctrines like they were
[1:03:49] we were we studied things
[1:03:54] you know what i'm talking about we had
[1:03:58] we had things back there we talked about
[1:04:00] things
[1:04:01] i thoroughly enjoyed the old man that
[1:04:03] was preaching when we
[1:04:05] left the baptist church he was a good
[1:04:08] old baptist
[1:04:10] 80 something years old talking about
[1:04:14] things that you heard brother branham
[1:04:15] talk about
[1:04:17] and i don't believe that he heard
[1:04:18] brother branham maybe he did
[1:04:20] because he never would the only thing
[1:04:21] he'd said was he says
[1:04:23] i'm not saying nothing i said have you
[1:04:25] ever heard of william branham
[1:04:27] he said i'm not saying nothing about the
[1:04:30] man
[1:04:31] he said there are some other people i'd
[1:04:33] like for you to talk to
[1:04:35] that would be able to discuss things but
[1:04:37] said i will not say nothing about the
[1:04:39] man
[1:04:41] it's because i'm sure he had to respect
[1:04:44] i've heard him tell about how he'd get
[1:04:47] up be preaching away and this man get up
[1:04:49] and start coming to the altar
[1:04:50] and a woman jump up and run over in
[1:04:52] front of him shouting speaking in
[1:04:53] tongues and things
[1:04:55] in the baptist church you say you
[1:04:56] weren't back there and all you were in
[1:04:57] the baptist church we used to sing and
[1:04:59] worship god
[1:05:02] so one day he said i'm going to end this
[1:05:04] thing
[1:05:05] next time she jumped up and started
[1:05:07] crosstalk in front of that man coming to
[1:05:08] the altar
[1:05:09] he went over to her and told her you sat
[1:05:11] down and shut up
[1:05:16] i'm sure he wasn't a popular fella right
[1:05:19] because everybody thought she was in the
[1:05:21] spirit yeah
[1:05:23] but he said the man comes out and got
[1:05:25] saved that night
[1:05:28] you see i've heard things in the baptist
[1:05:30] church we studied things we talk about
[1:05:32] things
[1:05:33] and brother around him come along
[1:05:34] telling us about these things some of
[1:05:36] the things i had
[1:05:39] you've never heard of what i've said
[1:05:40] there's a doctrine that man never had a
[1:05:42] soul
[1:05:43] until the law came into existence
[1:05:45] because the law was a knowledge of sin
[1:05:47] and a soul was human knowledge they
[1:05:50] never come into existence until
[1:05:54] the writing of the ten commandments i
[1:05:56] said well according to the bible
[1:05:58] it says in genesis adam was his living
[1:06:02] soul
[1:06:04] and i ran into that at work down there
[1:06:06] one day and the man told me that and he
[1:06:08] said
[1:06:08] well i've never seen it like that
[1:06:12] but you see church i've tried my best to
[1:06:15] study the word to try to get you to see
[1:06:17] things
[1:06:20] try to get you to understand what it is
