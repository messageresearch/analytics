on the hand and i know he's allergic so then susan they run over to the hospital and uh he's sitting over and we we prayed before he went just said a prayer and asked the lord to take it away and you know had to kill the little insect but we that's the way it works when they sting you and uh he uh got over there and he set for a few minutes and about 15 or 20 minutes and finally just said you know nothing's happening this thing has gone away i believe it but it stops from happening and his tongue didn't he swell up from his feet we all need to because the lord works in our lives and i believe in telling everybody what he does i mean there's just so much that comes every day and if you don't think things are working in this church folks just look around i can tell you every week things god

thinking myself what's going on and i kept telling the lord i said lord this is a lie of the devil and i'm not believing as soon as i started confessing that things started to turn around but we got over the ct scan and that's truly hurt and truly worried i had my family with it i had all my family had amy was with us too and i just had word for them more so than me you know but once i started confessing that there was nothing nothing there things turned around so i just want to say that and say this what is your confession amen because uh we we are to be the son of man on earth this word and because we have that that's our strength and our comfort through the holy spirit amen amen and we have to be encouraging to those who are troubled i don't see how anybody that is not born again

we have in our life that we need we must have him without him we can do nothing with him we can do all things we just love him and appreciate him so much and i sure appreciate y'all it's your beautiful bunch of people to preach to make it easy you know you've got to come with a desire in your heart you know prophet god told us we'll only get what we expect you know so we can't blame it on jesus when we don't get what we want because we didn't become not expecting anything then don't be disappointed if you don't i mean because the master he don't force nothing on us i'm thankful he don't do that he don't he don't make us do anything that's why he put us under a free moral agency he don't we don't serve him through fear and they serve him through love all right i'm thankful for that love that you get for us could you turn with me into the book of leviticus chapter 27 i'd like to read a few verses of scripture probably one through 10 i try not to be too long this afternoon but we surely want to let god have in his way you know you want him to get all the glory and all the honor glory all respect every thing to him and moses spake and the lord speaking to moses saying speaking to the children of israel and saying to them when a man shall make a single vow the person shall be for the lord by thy estimation and the estimation and thy estimation shall be of the male from 20 years old even to 60 years old even thy estimation shall be 50 shekels of silver after the shackle of the sanctuary and if it be a female then the estimation shall be 30 shekels and if it be from 5 years old even to 20 years old then thy estimation shall be of the male 20 shekels and for the female 10 shekels and if it be from a month old even unto five years old then thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver and for the female thy estimation shall be three shekels of silver and if it be from 60 years old and above if it be a male then thy estimation shall be 15 shekels and for the female 10 shackles but if he be poorer than thy estimation then he shall present himself before the priest and the priest shall value him according to his ability that vow shall the priests value him and if it be a beast whereof men bring an offering unto the lord and all that any man giveth of such unto the lord shall be holy but he shall not alter it nor change it a good for a bad or a bad for good and if he shall at all change beasts for beasts then it shall be the exchange thereof shall be holy let us pray father we pray this afternoon that you would come once again father and minister to us father i pray that you would sanctify our minds sanctify our spirits father and father may you find a welcoming heart here this afternoon god for father you only go where you're invited and father we want to go beyond an invitation to your father lord the church next door father they invited you but father we want to make you welcome lord father we want to wash your feet father we want to anoint your head father we want to put the robe on your father father we want you to be the main one here father that receives all the glory and honor father we want to see you high and lifted up father father which is the song says would you open the eyes of our heart that father as you did that day father when moses and elijah stood there and they was talking to your father peter and james and john was observing father you speaking to him father the cloud covered father but father when the smoke cleared there was no one left but jesus father that's where we're looking to this morning open this afternoon oh god father we're looking to you lord for inspiration father we're looking for you to do everything father this afternoon lord father your children have come long ways traveled lord not to hear from a man lord but father would you meet him father will you come now lord father and anoint me father with your word lord not me with your spirit father would you take my lips lord and speak to him father father they're hungry lord father i realize within myself i can do nothing lord father no ability within man but just to read the word lord but oh god would you send the angel now father the divine interpreter of the word the holy ghost and step into this man lord and father speak to your children father and may as this service is over with lord father will they i want them to have this testimony lord as the children on the road to emmaus walk father and they begin to talk and they begin to think on you and they begin to say these things father and here you appeared lord father we talked about you after the service father we we we've done everything we could father we prayed we asked your father but then you appeared lord will you appear to us this afternoon lord and father after everything is said and done father give them this testimony will you lord for your glory did not our hearts burn within us as you spoke to us along the way lord speak to us this afternoon lord father we'll be so clear quick to listen father and respond father for father we just don't want to be hearers of the word but we want to be doers lord and father the only way we can do your word lord is we have to become your word lord and father we want to become your word father we d we want to leave better christians father grant it to us lord meet the needs of your children father continue to give them strength father touch brother dale for his labor here in this vineyard lord father may your father bring forth great fruit for your kingdom father lord may they see you see be so pleased father that the work father you've allowed used this brother to do lord may there be a great trophy in your crown lord may there be jewels in the crown of jesus lord father way we become jewels lord father we thank you and we love you for your grace lord touch his wife lord brother dylan father meet that need father just having served you like myself but oh god you're a healer we've seen your power this morning lord man couldn't hardly speak yesterday fallen sick but oh god when jesus came no sickness can stand before you lord thank you for that transfusion of the blood lord father we thank you this afternoon that have your willing way for we ask you in jesus christ's name amen and amen you may receive it i'd like you to talk a little bit about this afternoon the value of the blood amen you realize that the blood is so valuable to us we look without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sin you know a lot of people say you know a lot of times they say that maybe you know we don't we don't need we've gone beyond the blood we don't need the blood but i'm here to tell you this afternoon it's so precious to us for without that blood there'd be no remission of sin and without that blood there'd be no life come back on the believer right for the blood didn't have any value then why wouldn't the blood of bulls and goats work that wouldn't all it did was just to cover it oh my when jesus came right when he came and gave that supreme sacrifice on calvary when he shed that precious blood he had a purpose in his life he come to shed that blood into his very life the very life would come right upon the believer that me and you once again could be reconciled back together with christ to thank that the prophet god said here's jesus and he took the hand of god and took the hand of man and put him back together that is how valuable it is to us this afternoon that's how wonderful that blood is to us i know that we've been saying the prophet said we went went beyond the blood but he was talking about the the lift that the lat the blood itself not that not the life or nothing to do with the blood but we're going to the whole going on into the holy ghost the life in the blood but we're so thankful for that shedding that shedding to think that he the king of kings the lord of lords would estimate me and you more valuable than his very own life i mean it's a paradox to think that the the king of glory would come down step into a human body and live the life of a man because in his heart in his desire he wanted to become kinsmen he wanted to be a redeemer he wanted to be a savior he wanted to be a healer he wanted to be all those attributes and the only way he could redeem mankind because of the fall in the garden is he had to come down and become near kinsmen amen he become brothers to us he become blessed brothers to us he becomes took on the blood of man the blood of god in a man come down into a human form and loved us so much that he would take all that the theme of leaving his glory to come down here to be spilled to have his beard plucked out to be malt to be made fun of and we we see that he was so so intact with his desires his will to please the father and fulfill the scriptures but it didn't stop him he didn't have no guile found in his mouth you could find nothing wrong with what he said how he conducted himself how he moved as a human being how he lived and he comes with such a great testimony to us right that he would show us that he's not by might amen not by power but it's by his spirit amen and we see with that spirit he showed us how we can take this word my brother and sister take this word and defeat the enemy any place anywhere anytime that's right he could tell he had the devil and this afternoon we have the devil's answer we have the answer to the devil when he tells us this and he uses scripture on us so many times but we have the ability to say satan it's also written more right it's also written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god i'm thankful this afternoon for that i'd like to look at just for a moment the estimation what do we estimate our savior at tonight what do we estimate this message at what value have we put on it what how much does it mean to us does it really mean as much to us as we say we do right is it more mean more to you than your very life your wife your brothers your sister your children your pastor is it that valuable to you oh it's more valuable to us than anything in this world for the true value that was placed was on the lost souls right jesus because everything else is going to pass away he become the word made flesh for he said heaven and earth will pass away but my word shall never pass away she said i want little little messiahs little word bodies of mine you know we don't realize how valuable we are to each other right for paul talks about when one member of the body suffers the whole body suffers you'd never think a big toe would humble somebody so much you don't understand how valuable that toe is how valuable you need that thing a lot of times we'll say well you know this brother's weak and he went off and he done these things he's backslidden he couldn't you know a lot of times they'll say well he went out from us because he was not elvis but we have to be careful right maybe it's just overtaking it a fault right you know a lot of times we don't value our brothers and sisters it's a value we should value right our lord valued us and more valuable than our very own life right when we realize when one part of the body suffers the whole body pays for it right when my toe begins to start giving me so much trouble i never realized that my toe could affect my whole body but once it got infected right it started affecting the bloodstream you know when there's an infection in the church and it gets in the bloodstream it affects every member of the church shut it let one part of the body start to have infection in it and see where the whole body responds to it you don't think right you don't have right pain changes people suffering changes people either it builds character in us oh yeah oh it shows what we really made pressure shows what we have let's look at this word estimation for just for a few moments the estimation is to form or to give an approximate opinion or calculation in his mind the great mighty god thought of me in you as he hung on that cross he knew there was no way back for man ever to come back and to be in full fellowship with god again right that's why they went into a place he had to prepare for him before the blood was called paradise and even the witch of endor could communicate with him still through man or through a gift could it be communicated with right but we see that when the blood come there's no more communication for the unbeliever to communicate with the believer i'm so thankful that he separated me and you from that place right he gave it an approximate opinion of me and you even though he was dead in sins and trespasses this bad shape is or some of us might have been in he valued you more than his own life when he walked down that crawl when he walked down walked down that hill del gotham i like what a buddy of mine sings you know he said he traveled the last mile on his knees you know what's wrong with us brothers and sisters we ain't traveled long enough on our knees god give me this trick the cow this last mile of the journey on my knees turn my cross carry my cross up the hill to down right you know that's what we need we need to kill him even through all the pain and the suffering and the agony that he went through amen it never stopped him he cried so much for me and you in the garden of gethsemane that his own tears became blood right his sweat became blood you talk about agonizing for his children what about me and you when our brothers and sisters have need we'll never maybe get to that place to do those things but we can we can sign and cry what about he said he's sending an angel to mark those who sigh and cry for the abominations done in this city what about your neighbor that you live aside and he's in trouble and he needs help you know what we're writing there'll be a time attempt that we'll pray for and they'll get rain where's the mercy see that right send the bride amen i'm glad he lives on the heart of man it's a primary opinion or statement of an approximate cost for a certain thing i can i cannot even ima i can't even comprehend in the natural mind the value that he placed on me in you yeah the value that the king of heaven would place that kind of value on me and you never love me and you more than anything even his very own life we look at romans 3 verse 23-26 he says for all have sinned and come short of the glory of god being freely justified by his grace through the redemption that is in christ jesus whom god has set to be a propitiation through faith in his blood to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are passed through the forbearance of god to declare i say at this time his righteousness that he might be just and a justifier of him which believeth in jesus oh my i'm so thankful that he even gave us the faith to believe in him right you could go out and ask anybody do you believe in god they'd say yes problem you could ask a drunkard do you believe in god do you believe jesus christ yes i do but it's a different kind right i believe it's the faith of god believing in god's word he give us this faith right and then he's going to reward me and you for accepting it it's a paradox brother dale the thing that he'll give you he has given us these things he's going to reward him just because we accepted him and we believed him you didn't have to work for it you didn't have to slave what you had to put in so many hours you didn't have to do anything you freely give he said free life give unto you freely you give unto others you know it's already the cost has already been paid for i like what paul said in hebrews 9 14 through 22. he said how much more shall the blood of christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to god you know i had a pastor in this message tell me one time brother there he said that jesus was not the perfect sacrifice and then i began to wonder if he really was in this message because if he wasn't that perfect sacrifice then we're all right amen because he had to be accepted right well there was no acceptance of god for me in you and you know you begin to wonder those things it's just the way people you know it's not it's a spirit's all it is it's not the man it's not the person and i said thank you lord for letting me see that glory he said how much more shall the blood of christ who threw the eternal spirit over himself without spot to god purge your conscience we needed it because look at when the blood of bulls and goats was applied they went right back out and done the same old scene every year they come back and offered it for the same things they was doing but this flight this power this spirit that come back has purged us purged our conscience from dead works to serve a living god amen right when we was out in the world we served everything we served sports stars we made islands out of them we served this we served that brother said we was nothing but a bunch of healers we walked around with a club on our back right we worshiped everything i like what the great apostle paul said when he was over there he walked up seeing that inscription to the unknown god amen boy you talk about revelation he said let me tell you who he is i'm glad that it takes revelation to be able to say those things and to be able to witness to people about who god really is that's right they still brushing him up in three pieces the denominational world even when he get down to the jesus only still got him in a box right they don't understand that he he is omnipotent omnipresent he is everywhere but we see that it comes through revelation he said and for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament right meaning you needed a mediator we needed somebody to stand in mine in your corner we needed an attorney right we was guilty we deserved hell but this great mediator of the new testament by the means of death for the redemption of transgressions that were under the first testament they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance for where a testament is there are also a necessity be the death of the testator amen the death that blows him and goats wouldn't do it brother aaron right right he said for the for a testament is a force after men are dead otherwise it is it is of no strength at all while the testator lived he had to die he had to show us that he was willing to give his life right oh you we can't help but love him look at the price he has paid for us he says for the testament for testament is a force after the men are dead otherwise it is no strength at all while the testator lived whereupon neither the first testament was decided was dedicated without blood for when moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law he took he took the blood of calves and of goats with water and scarlet wool and hiss and sprinkled both the book and all the people saying this is the blood of the testament which god has enjoyed unto you moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry and almost all things are by the law of purge with blood and without shedding of blood he's no remission right i am so thankful for that that he was willing to pray the supreme price for me and you right you know when i first heard the prophet said that there was a more near kismet redeemer than god it kind of being a young christian i'm like wow how could that be from god created all things and by here all things were created for him right but he said because of the fall in the garden right there was one called lucifer and he was afraid that me and you would mar just testimony oh yeah well i'm glad he refused to redeem me under his covenant right because we didn't all belong to covenant of death hell in the grave right but there was one that said ah i'll take it right i'll take it since you don't want it lucifer i'll come down right i'll give my life i'll take on the kids will redeem me i'll take it i like what the apostle john wrote in john chapter 1 verse 17 he says any of his fullness have already received grace for grace brother said in this age we have received double grace right oh my brothers and sisters what a magnificent thing to see that god has sent in the most wicked the most adulterous age of all he has sent me in you double grace we see that in corinthians first term went to the book of the corinthians first corinthians six read two little scriptures here 19 and 20. amen you still love the lord amen amen we can't help but love him it says verse 19 and what know you not that your body is the temple of the holy ghost which is in you what you have of god and you are not your home you know what's wrong with a lot of us we still have our own will we have our own desire we still have our own want to know he said for ye are bought with a price therefore glorify god right in your body and in your spirit which are gods you see here the apostle paul is showing us that we have been bought with a price it's a double declaration to the believer we have been brought through redemption and then reconciled reconciliation back to god but to become one with god look at jesus he said my greatest desire father as as me and you are one that father they'll be one right oh my not one like this but one with god amen god living in us we see that redemption has a greater source of obligation than creation or preservation redemption of this man the man that he created he said and he breathed the breath of life into the breath of adam but his obligation let's look at that obligation look at when the angels fell god never moved but when man failed god came to him amen oh come down to see where fallen man was where the fallen woman was god himself came down right adam where are you son i'm so thankful that that's his love for his creation he let the one well one-third of the angels fall off lucifer and all them but when man fell right our lord loved us so much that god himself come down look at you where are you i'm glad he gave me that call one day when i was out there in the wilderness of sin out there in god out there in satan's pigpen eating the swine huss is a prodigal son he came one day and said yeah richie where are you me lord why do you want me lord that's the first thing we ask you lord what do you want with me why do you want me i'm worthless i'm wretched i'm no good there ain't no hope for me he said but oh yes they are yeah all right you know what i'm even saying many times those are the people that's been raised in the message and they went off but you know what the satan played with my mind for all them years brother donny he played with my mind he said you went too far yeah you crossed the line your predestination see you cannot cross the line right because god wanted paul said in ignorance i even blessed me right the holy ghost talking about redemption that's the only sin unpardonable that's right but look where grace was right grace come to him knowing it was in ignorance calling the condition he was right right so we have to be careful what would you say about one another right you know they used to tell my mother said well you know you serpent seed you know you know if you can't you know your son you know raise this mess you went off you know how hard they used to be bro yeah no hope for us you know what i believe that brother i believe this man this flesh man believes something on the inside wouldn't let me swallow it he wouldn't do it but i believe i said yeah maybe i did satan said yes you did you know i held that carry that rock in my sack all in years until jesus came you know i told him i said lord i went too far i went too far he said your problem son you never went far enough you never did get bored again i'm glad he he made a one-on-one visitation to me i'm glad he loved me that much that he would come down and speak to me all right i like what brother brown said in the results of a decision that jeff and uh chicago illinois 1955. he said not long ago i was standing by a big museum we've heard this many times he said it had the estimation of the human body a man that weighed about a hundred and fifty pounds was worth 84 cents in chemicals he kind of he said last year he said put a ten dollar hat on at 84 cents boy i'm telling you he said put a 500 mink coat around 84 cents and stick your nose up if it rained it drown you he said then you think you're somebody and worth 84 cents he said you sure take care of that but brother you've got a soul that'll never die somewhere you'll take any old kind of dogmatic stuff for that swallow it down i like where he said even he tells somebody said you're going to a restaurant if we went to the cracker barrel last night and there was a spider in my in my crawling around in my roast beef and gravy i've been mad but he said and you'd want to serve but he said you take any old thing yeah and swallow it down whatever we watch just any old thing we listen to just any old thing we do just any old thing be careful what you feed you're so less than right right the white and the black dog live do you think you can't resurrect that black dog oh yeah he loves to eat you see but the only one way you can control him is you have to starve him right if you feed him and then you wonder why he raises up so much you've been feeding him some good nutritions the world you've been giving him the taste that he likes you know what that's even the world don't understand it when the prophet god preached a message called the thinking man's filter has a holy man's taste you know what people a lot of people around we don't understand but they can be a religious filter i'm gonna preach on that sometimes a religious film you know religious filler he can take any old thing he can take all these old he can take all his old contemporary a lot of contemporary music he'll take a lot of these other things and he can suck it right through there and you know what he gets a religious man's taste he jumps he rejoices but you know what i thought about taking temporary music we have to be very careful about that music because i come out of the world yeah i used to listen to all that rock and roll and boogie woogie just because they say certain things don't mean it's christian but he said many will cry lord lord in that day and won't enter in i've often wondered about this and you know when they've probably seen that preview of america's bride she was being led by a witch to the beat of rock and roll i wonder if it was contemporary gospel music because she was religious but she had no covering she was naked that's a religious man's filter right you know what i've never seen so many brothers there's so many people that say they're christians look at the homosexuals that make such a great move into christianity and saying you know we're all one yeah well that sounds like that sounds like the tower of babel they're doing a lot of foolish battling you know because not all of us are christians only those who are about by the blood of jesus christ and i believe the homosexual can be saved amen but he still won't do the same thing he still won't deal with john right you know what one of the biggest moves in contemporary one of the biggest ones i heard him say this i'm gonna say i'm gonna drop this i'm gonna drop this was ray boltz powerful contemporary singer from that pledge allegiance to the lamb the anchor hose but you know what he came out and said he said i am a homosexual and i believe i'm closer to god now than i've ever been you better be careful but we are here right you better be careful the bible tells me to try every spirit you know what some people say i want you to listen to songs so religious i mean it's so so beautiful and you get to listen to that thing and you pull it through that thank you mess filter and you know what it won't go you're good it's like having a piece of it you ever been drinking your tea and sucked up one of those uh lemon seeds in there that's the same way it is with god's filter right when you go to sucking on that thing he'll stop it up see the holy man's the holy man's children won't allow to go through that you don't get no more teeth until you get to until you get the seed out of the straw so what we need is we need a filter cleaning we need the holy ghost to clean out our filter so we can draw off the things of god right right i like what hebrews 7 7 says and without contradiction the less is blessed of the better me and you being the less has been blessed as the better of jesus christ i'm so thankful for that so thankful that he loved me in you so much that he give his life for me and you see when you have a blood transfusion you don't have all that confusion right because when you get that holy spirit he said he'd lead you and guide you into all truth right you know what when there's something said and it ain't quite right it's a little red light goes off you're right i've heard people say something i mean they'd be good yeah and it wasn't right right wasn't right i said oh that rob brown said they said that man had that dream he said it's a good dream but it ain't according to the word it won't go through the thinking man's filter so we have to try and see well it's all gone amen then we try to bring it through here and then what if it don't light up it ain't no good right i'm thankful for that i'm thankful that we got our own little light that lights up on the inside and tells us right tells us what we are you know without that blood we have no blood type you know what we're all humans but i said every one of those cattles was cows every one of them but he said he wasn't looking at even the brand on them that's right the brand they all had different brands on them all right you want to say well this one right here is from lula and this one's right here so gastonia this one here is from tennessee this one here is from kentucky he went looking at that right he was looking for a black tank all right now that you was born of his bone flesh of his flesh life of his life blood of his blood spirit of your spirit i'm glad we have a tag i'm glad we've not been bored through our ears they all had something but they we all had to have that we all have to have the dna of god right we all come from different races different cultures different ways of life but we're all born progressing the holy ghost all right no different right i'm thankful for that when the holy ghost comes here we all right we all like like our daddy i'm glad we're bored of god you see somebody ain't acting right they hadn't been born again or they hadn't mercy or they've got a spirit on because daddy don't misconduct himself our father knew how to conduct himself as we spoke this morning he knew he had the right behavior he he conducted himself just like the father he was so much like him i like what t.l.r said the prophet to god one time they got him you might have heard this brother they got him over there and they wanted him to say something against the prophet of god you know he's in the first assemblies and all those still out there i don't understand why i ain't come out of that i don't understand that that's between him and god and i'm not calling names or be little people but uh they got over there he was in africa because you know the message has just boomed over there well not longer they called him over there and they want him to because he'd been with the prophet they wanted him to say something about it tell me this is all frozen this can't be of god but i like what he did he got up and he said him and hit him in the pool but they said kill we want you to kill it count it on him show him surely this is a fanatical move this is all wrong but i like what he's saying he said he said tell him he's a false prophet but he got up early said you know so there's one thing i can say if there was a prophet hey for this age it was william amen thank god for him understanding and then we we're afraid to say we think about this message here's a man that ain't even in this message that has enough love of god to stand there and tell what's truth right for that no matter what he what he's done or whatever however he believes but he stood and told the truth honesty always counts and you know what they said well you know tal said well they baptize him his name and they do all these things he said well let me tell you something about william man brett he said you know it's like an old blacksmith he said when he put that piece of iron in that fire and he got that hot fire so hot he said that iron and that fire become one he said you couldn't tell the iron from the fire he said that's the way the william branham was he said he lived so close to god that people mistake him for god i want to ask us this afternoon has anybody been stick mistaking me and you i don't want to go we got to come to that place my brothers and sisters i got to come to that place that's the greatest testimony he could ever say about the prophet he lived so close to him right until he become one with the father glory and people he mistaken him for god not that we worship the prophet by no means we worship the same god i serve the god of elijah that's right and he works with him in spirit and truth right he he was lived such a life and he lived so close to god that he manifest that he manifested the fruits yeah that's what we need to do we need to start manifesting some fruits we've been in the garden a long time but we need a lot of pruning yeah we need putting off the flowers to bring forth to bring forth the fruit we're producing a lot of leaves we ain't producing a lot of fruit oh i'm glad the master of the vineyard sent somebody to come and come to the grave let's look at what jesus said here in matthew 10 verse 29-31 he says and not to spare us so for our father and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your father he said but the very hairs of your head are numbered so i hadn't lost one they're all coming back he said fear ye not therefore ye are more they uh of more value than many spirits he didn't die for creation right he died for man right he died he caught he he got creation in the in the price he paid right he come and shed his blood on the ground and redemp and redeemed that but he come that that life in that blood might come on me and you amen see they don't have a soul come on but me and you do right so your soul is worth more than ten thousand worlds right and i like what the prophet said in one place my pastor said he seen one place where he said 10 million worlds yeah so what value where do we place our value look at moses just for a minute now moses could have been the greatest man in egypt and he was he was fixing to be the pharaoh right and if he wouldn't have done what he did he wouldn't took his choice right now i wonder a lot of times what choice would we make right yeah when it come even preachers i wonder what choice will you come saul had a choice too king saul but the people was we want that come on let us keep these calves let us keep these guns you know what i thank god for a man is not not afraid to tell the truth that's the difference between a higher level right and one that god has called right right it's not about big who who's got the most it's about genuine robin said hey god ain't into all that glitter and shine he's into the glowing i'm looking for character that's what god's looking for the character of christ when he come for a wife when he talked about the man he was coming looking for the wife he's looking for character you know old lady little girl she went out there and she watches this she didn't complain her cousins made fun of her malta many of us and our fam members of our family and people wrestle they make fun of us and say you know he's in that club he's one of those oh yeah he's a brand of might everybody you know you don't know one day they're going to stand before god and be held accountable for every idle word you spoke we better be careful right you know what we have to be careful what we how we respond to them too the lord checked me one day he said don't push them don't push them because they can cross the line that's right and they'll lose anything they would ever got so we have to be careful you know only if we're led by the spirit it's like somebody called me one time a friend of mine and his wife they started going to church you know they heard i know he's out in the world we went to the things of the world you know not glorifying the world we're not trying to put anything on that that's the devil we don't we don't go off right now that stuff that was all i wish i never would have done there's no glory on that but they called me and they said well we won't you his wife got on the phone she said i want to ask you something i want to ask you something you know questions i thought well okay you get wonderful once people want to ask your questions because you know they're they was in that charismatic move you know and the first thing he did was he asked me man i'm in gospel music now i knew you played the bar the guitar all that stuff sung all that stuff said i want you to counseling i'm playing in the gospel band now i thought well um i probably should have prayed more i was just a young christian i went down with this church and they had a strobe light and they had all that moving this was in the church assemblies of god now oh there i thought oh my i went right back in the bar i started playing the blood i started playing the blood i said god had mercy on me but you know what he began to play those things he began to play the contemporary music i thought oh my god i'm sitting right here and i said you know what scripture come to me he said he'll sit in the synagogues of god and be worshipped as god yeah i said they don't even realize it commercially so you know that you know you came up to me after that you know i was trying to be nice you know brother said he went in somewhere he was the one preaching trying to be nice don't get up right there and show respect and i was trying to give respect to him he came up to me they put you on the spot he said how'd you like that for oh my lord what can i say i said well i'll tell you one thing i've never seen gospel music approached that way they said oh i know what you are you want them old cornbread you like that old-fashioned stuff i said praise god you hit me on the head that nail will clench and then you know they said well you know then they started calling well you know he's a bible thumper but it's just god that shows us what i mean when i first met i couldn't hardly read none of that but god gave me i still a little weak but you know he helped me he helped me to do these things and uh she called me up she said i want to ask you something i see what she's gonna ask me because i knew she believed in certain things you know and it wasn't scriptural that was going this big thing you know and they said she said i want to talk don't ask you something said do you believe in deaconesses do you believe in women preachers my boy those are hard questions i thought now oh lord you got me in the sun now lord you're gonna have to help me get out of here you know what i said the lord gave me a soft answer i said well i if you ask me again i was trying to give her an escape you know being a young christian trying to get him escaped even as older christians a lot of times we want to give him a way of escape right and i said uh i said well if you ask me again then i'm obligated you know being a christian we're obligated to tell them the truth i said if you ask me again then i really know you want to know what god has showed me it's not me that knows it right it took him to show me what the word said i said now the only thing i can say is what the word says you know she said okay answer this question me being that man god just let's you know when he comes brother oh he comes out such a sweet loving spirit and he said take her over there through the qualifications right i'm a deacon you know i'm hidden he said she must he must be the husband of one wife amen i said besides where is the word dickiness in the bible so he bailed me out of that i thought hold on she said well wait a minute i want to know about the woman preacher i knew it was coming i knew i could i could tell the tension was built and i said well show me one place in the bible where there was a priest that handled the fire the word of god that was a woman right she said i could hear you know that religious demons said that's a powerful deal that's a powerful name or being preaching on the radio i've run into a lot of those powerful demons you'll get more response to have a raw center than you will the religious people they'll stone you they'll pick up stones and they'll stone like they said they pull them out of their bag their bag's empty because they've used them careful that our bag's not empty she said well so i took it over the table god said turn over to timothy i said oh my okay lord with that spirit was in that sweet spirit and then when he comes in he there that's right i mean you know a lot of us get more let me tell you you're wrong we're going to hell in that way right it's just a sweet homeless spirit i said well let's look over in timothy let's look over there this wasn't me i couldn't do those things he's bringing them back to me brother whenever i show your word you know worship not a woman to teach have authority over the man but to be silent in church that's all she can stood that's obviously just good to stand well that see i said show me one apostle yeah i mean i'm still young but he showed me this thing and boy i could feel her growling i could hear her breath on the other hand that's an old man i made this bull man you know she said you know what you are you're a male shown this pig i said if i i said i'm the word offending that's a different thing i said that if i have offended you forgive me i said but if you're offended by the word you know and she said here give the other you're talking that man he ain't nothing but a male show this pig now he can't wait to get on the phone he said he said but you know what brother i said but he said that's the way our pastor you know a lot of times that's what we say around the message that's the way our pastor teaches it oh my god sees anything but a word i said well it's like this you know god gives you wisdom i said it's like this i said now if a man told you to walk and he said now buddy you can fly now this is how simple god just made me a simple man i'm glad he did he said if a man tells you you can jump off that empire state building you can fly i said would you get up on top of that empire state building and jump off because he told you you could fly he said no way i said that's the same thing you're doing now right you ain't in the word you are committing spiritual suicide right i got the phone hung up the phone and grief come on me brother and i began to pray for him i said god forgive them that's right for they don't know because i didn't want to lay that charge too right hoping that god would save their soul right see you don't understand the holy spirit that wouldn't mean i couldn't do that a lot of times in this collection they said that boy i want to show them yeah boy let me show you you know this man wants to be he wants to be he wants to take credit if he ain't got the holy ghost that man wants to make himself known he wants to prove something i like what my pastor told me one time he said brother richard brother richard he said one thing about he said well god gives a man revelation it humbles you he said but when man gets revelation it exalts you right exactly so that's how you can tell if god give it to him by another man the way he conducts himself and he says those things and you know i just thank god that he gives us this ability the value you know you could we can we have to be careful this message because this message is like an atomic bomb we got to we got a bomb that's right this is that and we have to be careful who we use them right right we've got to be careful when we drop that bomb right we can destroy people's lives amen and they can seal their destinations by their words exactly right we have to be very careful we have to be led the spirit yes you know but they still kept calling they'd call me said when you pray for me and we pray for you to sit i thought praise god thank god just moved it over lord if i'd have done it myself i'd mess it up we always the lord does me brother sometimes you know you want to tell somebody and then when you tell when i can tell when it ain't when it ain't god he'll stutter me all right i know he knows what that man will think or what that woman will say and we have to be careful how we give it to him that's right because they can turn that thing around and they can blaspheme that's right he knows this thing i'm glad he does that when i'm saying okay okay lord i understand that you know we have to grow up but let's look over in matthew chapter 27 just for a minute i'm gonna stop right here i'm gonna get this right here i'm gonna finish it right here we sure appreciate each and every one of you verse three said then judas which had betrayed him when he saw that he was condemned repented himself and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders this is saying i have sinned and that i have betrayed the innocent blood and they said what is that to us look at their attitude he says see thou to that and he cast down the 30 pieces of silver in the temple and departed and went and hanged himself and the chief priest took the silver pieces and said it is not lawful for to put them into the treasury because it is the price of blood right he said and they took counsel and brought with them bought with it and bought within the potter's field to bury strangers in oh god hit you glad repent buried in christ he said wherefore the field was called the field of blood unto this day then once fulfilled that which was spoken by jeremy the prophet saying and they took the 30 pieces of silver the price of him that was valued whom they are the children of israel did value and gave them for the potter's field as the lord appointed me remember when we read over there and deuteronomy and uh deuteronomy i want to look at the price right here for just a minute i'm going to stop right here let's look at this now let's look at those silver pieces god showed me this little simple thing and i want to share it with you now let's look at a joseph he was estimated at the young man's price you can turn back to look with me in deuteronomy chapter 27. look at those first 10 verses everybody talks about values but look at this now we know that joseph was a soul of his brother for the price of 20 pieces of silver god spoke to me and said that was the price of a young man right and look at the woman she was sold for 30 pieces of silver god said i wasn't even valued at the price of a man because i didn't come to redeem me i came to redeem my wife right and there is the estimation of those 30 pieces of silver that judas sold jesus for the female was estimated he took the value of the woman to redeem his wife 30 pieces of silver amen he said i come to redeem my way amen not to redeem the man the man was 50 pieces of silver what about that what about that god went ahead and said i'll take the value of the woman you can value me at the value of a woman it was supposed to be it was supposed to be disgraceful to him to be valued as a man at that price that's 30 pieces of silver but in his disgrace we took on his grace isn't that beautiful how god and you know what every scripture has a meaning every scripture has a thought and i dolphin wondered what did that 30 pieces of silver had a value what did it really mean i knew it solely for but where it has to be somewhere in the scripture and the lord showed it to me one day he said read that again i preached on the vein of the blood one other time uh another time and he said go back and read that again i want to show you something i was back there in the study he said read that again i read that he said look at joseph 20 pieces i said ah i never thought that you know it's i think when god gives it to us because he gets the glory he said read on down 30 pieces for the female woman you know he didn't come to buy our baby and come to marry a woman i'm a cuter bride and he said now look at what judah sold me for they estimated me like the value of a woman amen he said but i was willing to take that because i didn't need redemption but the woman did and i said my thank you lord that you estimated me that you estimate yourself and you took on my price you know where it said the priest will value and give an estimation he was willing being the faithful high priest to take that value of what they valued at him and he took that on and he become the redemption for mankind amen now i like where it says down in the scripture you know what and the prophet of god talked about jeremiah when he talked about that he went down and he bought the potter's feet with that that's where me and you come from the partner went down into the field and getting in you to mold me and make you into vessels of honor i said oh my god you make the scripture so alive all right you make the scripture come so alive you went down to the you know what the problem god said one time he said we have come we got to be like jeremiah he said i'm going down to the potter's house to be broken when he go down to the potter's house he's breaks you and he mows you and makes you into what he wants you to do i pray that god is breaking us with his word and molding us and making us into vessels of honor let us stand i'm thankful that god has given us the ability to receive the word of god and to love him and just think he was estimated at the value of a woman you know i thought my what a disgrace to ask to estimate a man at the value of a woman him being a man but he said there was no disgrace to me he said because i didn't need redemption i come from my wife so i was willing to pay the price right just like just like hosea he was willing to pay the price willing to pay the price are we willing this afternoon to pay the price are we willing to forsake all things and make jesus christ our center peace willing to give our all to him willing to let go and let god have his way every head now maybe i close if you have a need would you raise your hand god knows all about it have you really estimated him as much value as his estimated jesus i raised my hand and said god help me to look at my brothers and sisters in a different way help me to look at you in a different way father father with more love with more joy with more desire for one another with more of that brotherly kindness father that's your pastors without brother kindness will never come to perfect love father we're here once again father in the potter's house father you truly took the word following your breaking us but father we're become gladly this

that there's an odd part of that scripture too that says that the male's price from one month up to five years was five sickles all the others would always hide five five five right but not in that verse it says the females price was three shekels now they knew how to say two and a half no problem with it but you see faith grace and faith grace and faith grace and perfection well that's what it
