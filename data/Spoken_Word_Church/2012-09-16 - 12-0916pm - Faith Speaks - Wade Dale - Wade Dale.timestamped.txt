[33:57] with us if you got your bibles if you
[33:58] would turn to the book of second
[34:00] corinthians
[34:02] and we will uh
[34:04] start on a little subject that
[34:07] it kind of struck my heart uh if you
[34:09] realize
[34:11] some of the brethren that have been here
[34:14] and also
[34:17] uh some of the brethren that were
[34:19] speaking at the uh
[34:21] at the meeting that we went to in
[34:24] virginia
[34:25] speaking on faith
[34:27] so we're going to speak a little bit
[34:28] this
[34:29] afternoon on
[34:31] faith speaks
[34:33] faith speaks
[34:35] faith is not silent
[34:38] faith says something
[34:40] we're going to read here the mayor
[34:41] brother brown said faith's got hair on
[34:42] his chest
[34:45] got teeth
[34:46] man
[34:47] faith is something that we need
[34:50] because if we don't have faith in what
[34:51] we're doing
[34:53] then we're men most miserable
[34:56] you gotta have faith in what's going on
[34:58] have faith in what's uh and what's
[35:00] happening you have to have
[35:02] you have to have faith just to make it
[35:03] through the day
[35:05] all right i mean we we need to have more
[35:07] faith and we need to have a substance
[35:09] faith
[35:10] and then let that faith speak
[35:12] all right in second
[35:14] corinthians chapter four
[35:19] i guess by way of announcements the only
[35:20] thing we really have to announce is the
[35:22] fpu class this afternoon will start at
[35:25] five
[35:26] and then
[35:27] i think terence already said this
[35:29] morning and the guys did here i think i
[35:31] couldn't hear him in the back but
[35:32] october the 20th we'll be having our
[35:34] fall festival down at the uh
[35:37] at the daleville chicken house which is
[35:38] being renovated
[35:40] because the uh
[35:42] the winds of change blue
[35:44] the roof off
[35:46] so we they are putting a roof on now and
[35:50] and getting everything ready to go so
[35:52] just pray for that
[35:54] now um
[35:55] if you would like to um
[35:58] keep that scripture right there for just
[36:00] a minute because i want to make a
[36:01] comment afterwards but let's uh let's
[36:04] bow our heads before we get started
[36:07] dear heavenly father we pray that you
[36:09] would today
[36:10] just touch us lord
[36:12] be with each one of us in this
[36:14] congregation father that
[36:16] that you would come our way lord and it
[36:18] wouldn't be just the words of a mortal
[36:20] man but it would be your word father
[36:23] it'd be the words that you have to speak
[36:25] to your people
[36:26] that you become lord an active
[36:28] participant in the service not just a
[36:30] bystander lord
[36:32] we don't want to be
[36:33] we don't want to be something that you
[36:35] don't want us to be lord
[36:37] we want to be something that's molded in
[36:39] your image we want to be a child lord
[36:42] that it's starting and then lord we
[36:43] don't want to stay a child we want to
[36:45] grow up into the things that you've
[36:47] given us
[36:48] we pray lord that you just be with the
[36:49] congregation now lord just open our eyes
[36:52] and open our ears that we may hear and
[36:53] see what you have for us lord
[36:56] bless the little bride around the world
[36:57] father bless the missionaries on the
[36:59] foreign fields
[37:00] take care of them lord give them fruit
[37:02] for their labor
[37:03] lord you said if there'd be any sick
[37:04] among us you sent your word and healed
[37:06] the people and deliver them from their
[37:08] destruction so lord there is
[37:10] there is the atonement laying there
[37:12] father for each one of us to grab hold
[37:13] of
[37:14] father just bless us be with us take
[37:16] care of us
[37:17] we ask all these things in the name of
[37:18] jesus christ
[37:20] amen second corinthians 4
[37:23] we have this
[37:25] same
[37:26] have we having the same spirit of faith
[37:29] according as it is written i believe and
[37:31] therefore have i spoken now that's in
[37:33] the book of psalms we also believe and
[37:36] therefore speak
[37:37] knowing that he which raised up the lord
[37:40] jesus shall raise up us also by jesus
[37:44] and shall present us with you now watch
[37:46] paul
[37:47] paul is prophesying he's talking about
[37:49] himself but he's talking about a group
[37:51] that's to come but he said for look he
[37:54] says knowing that he which raised up the
[37:55] lord jesus shall raise up us also by
[37:58] jesus so he was dead
[38:00] all right and shall present us with you
[38:05] so he's talking to a group of people
[38:07] for all things are for your sake
[38:11] you're saved
[38:13] that the abundant grace might through
[38:15] the thanksgiving of many redounds to the
[38:18] glory of god
[38:19] for which cause we faint not
[38:22] but though our outward man perish
[38:26] yet the inward man is renewed day by day
[38:29] for our light affliction which is but
[38:31] for a moment
[38:32] well ze wells you
[38:34] worketh for us a far more exceeding and
[38:37] eternal weight of glory
[38:39] while we look not at the things which
[38:41] are seen but at the things which are not
[38:43] seen
[38:44] for the things which are seen are
[38:46] temporal but the things which are not
[38:48] seen
[38:49] are eternal
[38:50] all right you may be seen in the lord as
[38:52] blessing to the reading of the word but
[38:53] look what what paul is saying here
[38:56] knowing
[38:57] that he which raised up the lord jesus
[38:59] shall raise up us also by jesus and
[39:02] present shall present us
[39:05] with you right there
[39:07] talk about two groups of people
[39:09] what's going to go by the grave
[39:11] and i believe one that's going to be
[39:12] standing at the chains of the body
[39:14] all right now listen
[39:16] i want us to let to listen today
[39:19] that faith speaks
[39:22] and i want you to apply it to your life
[39:24] and apply it to everything in your life
[39:25] not just not just religious matters
[39:28] because we are
[39:29] humans and we are living in this world
[39:32] and as long as we're going to be in this
[39:33] world
[39:34] we got to live in the world but not of
[39:37] the world right right
[39:38] so in our finances and in our daily walk
[39:41] in life and the things that we do we
[39:43] should always have faith in what we're
[39:45] doing amen all right because if you
[39:47] don't have faith
[39:49] then you don't have the works and you
[39:51] don't have the other things and and i
[39:53] was looking at a quote but i couldn't
[39:54] pull it up because the the copiers
[39:56] messed up back there but but brother
[39:58] brown says
[40:00] these things that we do
[40:02] if we can't handle
[40:04] i'll read a quote in just a second that
[40:06] i did get off that we got to be able to
[40:08] handle certain things that god's going
[40:11] to give us see if we can handle it and
[40:13] then give us more if we can handle this
[40:19] the word
[40:21] money job life this applies to
[40:24] everything all right because god's not
[40:26] going to give you something
[40:28] amiss because he doesn't make mistakes
[40:31] right we do we make mistakes he knows
[40:33] what we're going to do with it but he's
[40:34] not going to pile a whole lot of word on
[40:36] you if your life's not right
[40:39] he's not going to pile a whole lot of
[40:41] faith on you if you don't believe right
[40:44] all right but there's a group of people
[40:46] that's going to have to believe to the
[40:48] body change that's going to have to take
[40:50] a basis of just like faith at the
[40:52] pyramid gonna have to take a base and
[40:55] build from that amen
[40:58] built up the bible says what into these
[41:00] things so it's not just something that
[41:02] says well i have faith
[41:05] well james said if you got faith show me
[41:07] your works
[41:09] faith without works is dead
[41:12] i'll show you my faith by the works that
[41:15] i do
[41:16] right
[41:17] all right so let's just realize for just
[41:19] a little while that we've got to have
[41:22] not a super duper faith but we do have
[41:24] to have a faith different
[41:29] right
[41:30] than luther's faith
[41:33] different than wesley's faith you say
[41:35] different not in contrast no
[41:38] but different as in the just shall live
[41:41] by faith will not get you even into the
[41:44] body of christ now
[41:46] but it did
[41:47] luther
[41:49] we'll read a quote in a little while
[41:50] that brother brown said and that's
[41:52] preached in a long time ago that the
[41:54] woman that touched him of jesus's
[41:55] garment she had faith for her time
[41:58] so let's realize that we do we have
[42:00] faith for the time that we're living in
[42:04] and god will not give you the faith of
[42:06] another age
[42:08] he gives you the faith for your age
[42:11] and you must accept that faith and then
[42:14] what you do with that faith if not it
[42:16] doesn't become dormant you must speak it
[42:19] right
[42:19] all right
[42:20] because there's an approach to all these
[42:23] things there's an approach to god
[42:25] remember in the old testament the the
[42:27] high priest had to
[42:28] everything had to be perfect right
[42:31] he couldn't miss one step or he would it
[42:33] meant death
[42:35] right now that was a natural man taking
[42:38] a natural blood into the into the holy
[42:41] of holies what about now
[42:44] that the holiest of holy blood
[42:46] the blood of god that was shed for you
[42:49] and i i mean
[42:50] and we take it
[42:52] and we fumble around with it and we
[42:53] stumble and we fall
[42:57] but the bible says come boldly to the
[42:59] throne of grace we have a high priest
[43:02] a high priest that he will
[43:04] that high priest went in once a year
[43:07] for the sins of the people
[43:09] they confess their sins the high priest
[43:13] took the blood in and they were covered
[43:15] but it didn't do away with sin
[43:18] but when jesus came he did away with sin
[43:21] that's why we could approach we like
[43:23] brother bob was talking this morning
[43:24] about solomon's porch
[43:26] you get to a certain you get to a
[43:28] certain level and you have to stop
[43:31] even in god there's a road map
[43:34] even in god there's a way to approach
[43:36] him right
[43:37] you you approach him and you know we we
[43:40] try to to help as much as we can
[43:43] but you can't have the things of the
[43:44] world and just walk in here and sit down
[43:46] and think god's going to give you
[43:48] something right
[43:50] our problem is we get it here but not
[43:53] here
[43:54] if you get it here that's okay
[43:57] but it's got to come into here it's like
[43:59] and what this struck me was what brother
[44:01] they was talking about listen you take
[44:02] the daniel 70 weeks the daniel 70 weeks
[44:05] is to the jews right
[44:08] the seals are to the jews
[44:11] and you know you have these brethren
[44:12] that are that are saying well well it
[44:14] doesn't matter about daniel 70 weeks why
[44:16] are we getting all worked up about it
[44:17] it's to the jews that's true
[44:20] so now let's just throw our seal book
[44:21] away too
[44:25] let's just throw the seal book away
[44:26] because this to the jews too
[44:28] when are we going to quit throwing away
[44:29] books
[44:30] when are we going to quit throwing away
[44:31] tapes
[44:32] when we're going to quit throwing away
[44:34] quotes
[44:35] we can't do that we got to have faith in
[44:37] what we believe and then not just stand
[44:40] there we got to be able to speak it
[44:42] you got to be able to take your
[44:44] revelation and take it to the jews
[44:46] because that's what it's going to come
[44:47] out of it's going to come out of you
[44:49] right
[44:50] it's going to come out of an end time
[44:51] people and what's going to the jews is
[44:54] not going to be corruptable
[44:57] they have corruptible already
[45:00] that's what their problem is
[45:03] they need incorruptible word of god
[45:05] they need somebody to tell them the
[45:07] truth that's right and go over there
[45:09] with faith two prophets is gonna walk
[45:11] over there and the bible says whatever
[45:13] comes out of their mouth that's what's
[45:14] gonna happen what faith is gonna speak
[45:17] but faith is not going to speak because
[45:19] that's the first time it ever happened
[45:24] i don't believe that i don't believe
[45:25] they're just going to go over there and
[45:26] do something different than what we do
[45:30] we've got it they've got to take what we
[45:32] have
[45:34] and take it over there and say you
[45:36] missed this that's right
[45:38] you missed a messiah
[45:40] you've had a problem for 2500 years or 2
[45:43] 000 years or how long it is you have a
[45:45] problem
[45:47] now you don't have a problem because
[45:49] this group of people spoke
[45:52] and god answered their prayers
[45:54] so therefore two prophets can stand and
[45:56] say hey
[45:58] if they can do it with a message
[46:00] that they had and that same message is
[46:03] here now
[46:04] you see how snowball yes
[46:06] faith is a snowball you got to have you
[46:08] got to have people in
[46:10] you know in our financial peace class
[46:13] the reason we get together
[46:15] is because we want to speak
[46:19] our experience
[46:22] right we know every sunday we're going
[46:24] to come together and we're going to talk
[46:25] about our experience with money
[46:28] that's called accountability right
[46:30] same way with god we got to have some
[46:32] accountability with god that's why we
[46:34] gather together as an assembly every
[46:36] sunday
[46:37] and every wednesday we become
[46:38] accountable not to each other but to god
[46:42] because god said i'll meet you in here
[46:43] that's right now we know he can meet you
[46:45] in other places but he said i'll meet
[46:46] you right here
[46:49] at 10 and at 2 and it's 7 o'clock if you
[46:51] miss it then you miss god you miss a
[46:52] visitation
[46:54] because he said he'd be here right we're
[46:55] two or three together to my name they'll
[46:57] be in the midst
[46:59] but apply this and i love what brother
[47:01] tim pruitt was saying
[47:03] this past weekend when we're in virginia
[47:06] now
[47:07] let me tell you something brother tim
[47:08] pruitt most of you don't know him
[47:11] there was a lady told him one time he
[47:12] was the meanest preacher in the message
[47:15] right
[47:16] said you're the meanest preacher in the
[47:18] message because he's very strict very
[47:20] stern very hard most of you just heard
[47:22] him you know that but he's got a good
[47:23] revelation and he preaches good he's a
[47:25] good minister good good pastor there in
[47:27] louisiana but he said look he said i
[47:30] found out
[47:32] that you can't beat the people
[47:34] into doing anything
[47:36] he said oh you can make them conform
[47:39] like alcoholics anonymous make you
[47:41] conform
[47:44] but we want to transform
[47:46] so he said let's preach faith
[47:49] let the people catch a revelation of
[47:51] faith
[47:53] in this
[47:56] believe in the message and you'll come
[47:58] to church on time you'll do the right
[48:00] thing
[48:01] you'll handle your money right you'll do
[48:02] all these things right because look
[48:04] god's not going to let you just he's not
[48:05] gonna let us run wild he let him run
[48:07] wild in the church ages that's right he
[48:09] really did he let him believe the one
[48:11] one god was trinity and he let him
[48:12] believe baptism was this
[48:15] because of our ignorance
[48:17] but now this age
[48:19] all that goes away
[48:21] all that goes out buddy that goes out
[48:24] the door
[48:25] that's not the faith that you and i are
[48:26] called to
[48:28] you and i are called to a perfect faith
[48:30] glory jesus walked in the world of
[48:32] perfect faith and i'm gonna read you a
[48:33] quote in a minute jesus said brother
[48:35] brown said jesus walked in the world of
[48:37] perfect faith and he was the word that
[48:40] when we become the word guess what that
[48:42] brings us into
[48:44] a walk of perfect faith all right so
[48:46] listen let's just don't
[48:48] let's just get a base in here maybe we
[48:50] can do it a little bit later on but
[48:52] let's preach faith
[48:56] believe in something amen
[48:59] oh sure
[49:00] god god you know a prostitute can have
[49:02] faith
[49:05] she enters into a a part of god that
[49:08] says if you'll just believe me i'll give
[49:09] you this
[49:11] right
[49:12] but a christian's got to have more than
[49:13] just that kind of faith
[49:15] right we got to bring a perfect faith in
[49:17] the word she didn't have a faith in the
[49:19] word or she wouldn't be a prostitute
[49:22] she had faith for her time and for what
[49:24] needs she needs
[49:25] god will answer your prayer and you'll
[49:27] be a rank sinner he did me when i was a
[49:29] sinner
[49:31] i had a migraine one night late in bed
[49:33] and i was sick
[49:35] and i was a rank center this was in the
[49:36] 90s and i said god
[49:38] i need to get some sleep i got to go to
[49:41] work in the mornings when i was getting
[49:42] up at 3 o'clock in the morning going to
[49:43] work and you know what if all of you
[49:45] have migraines before
[49:47] even after you get over the migraine
[49:49] it's still there
[49:51] your head soaring
[49:52] completely went away
[49:54] because i entered into something to
[49:57] where i believed in god and i believed
[50:00] what he said
[50:01] for that time though because the rest of
[50:03] the time i was a sinner
[50:05] okay
[50:06] but now you and i must have faith upon
[50:09] faith upon faith upon faith
[50:13] not just one little spot of faith
[50:16] we got to have substance faith that when
[50:17] we get up in the morning we got faith
[50:20] when we go to bed at night we got faith
[50:23] right
[50:24] so that's what we're coming to it's not
[50:25] just well i got healed so god must be
[50:28] with me that'll mean a thing
[50:30] i don't mean a thing
[50:33] i'm sorry i said people believe it
[50:35] that's right
[50:36] i know they do
[50:38] but now remember we're going to bring to
[50:40] and i'll show you when we start with the
[50:41] quotes in a minute
[50:43] that there is a mental faith
[50:46] you do have to get it in the mental part
[50:49] it's got to come right here first
[50:52] you first must hear the word because
[50:54] somebody's got to speak it
[50:56] right that's right so you got to hear it
[50:58] it's got to become mental
[51:00] but let's don't keep it at the mental
[51:02] faith part
[51:04] because brother brown says then it
[51:06] drops down into a spiritual revelation
[51:10] becomes a part of you amen
[51:13] faith's not something that we need on a
[51:14] shelf and we go get it that's what i
[51:16] think people think well i'll just i'll
[51:18] just i need faith for this
[51:19] you're supposed to have it already here
[51:22] this is where you draw from you draw it
[51:24] from here you don't draw it from from
[51:25] off the shelf and say well i need it so
[51:27] i'll just have it
[51:29] no
[51:30] we got to walk in a world of perfect
[51:32] faith
[51:33] and you know what god said we were
[51:36] supposed to
[51:37] through a prophet he told us we were
[51:39] supposed to so he's not going to leave
[51:41] his hand
[51:43] he's made a way for us to do that
[51:46] he's made a way for us to be that way
[51:49] but now the word speak means
[51:51] make a statement or to express with a
[51:54] voice
[51:57] speak faith speaks
[51:59] faith is not silent
[52:02] faith is not something that we have to
[52:04] work up
[52:07] the bible says there we also believe
[52:11] and therefore
[52:12] speak
[52:13] amen you gotta believe in something
[52:16] you got to believe in something before
[52:18] you can speak it
[52:20] all right
[52:21] i believe that you'll go through this
[52:23] financial peace class i believe that
[52:24] you'll get your debts paid off i believe
[52:26] that you know why because i've done it
[52:29] i've had an experience
[52:31] of just something just that jim and i
[52:33] have had an experience with this
[52:36] so same way with god i've had an
[52:38] experience with god so i can speak
[52:41] what i believe that's right
[52:44] right right but it can't be i can't say
[52:46] well i still believe in a trinity
[52:49] oh i may believe that
[52:51] but that's what dad was talking about
[52:52] that's the deception you got to watch it
[52:54] because it'll move over in a deception
[52:56] if it's not the word of god right right
[52:59] but if it's the word of god it's got to
[53:01] come to pass
[53:02] it's got to be there it's already there
[53:06] what you and i have to do is just get it
[53:08] right just go get it so let's look at
[53:10] the first quote number one
[53:15] faith comes by hearing but if you just
[53:17] rely on hope
[53:19] you hinder faith oh i hope i'm gonna
[53:23] i hope i'm gone
[53:27] you know we used to have pep rallies at
[53:28] football games you know we used to just
[53:30] oh man well you know what it was just a
[53:31] hope
[53:32] right it was just a hope
[53:35] it wasn't a faith it was just hope they
[53:36] were trying to build you in the faith
[53:38] but it was just a hope
[53:40] but in this with god it's not never a
[53:42] hope
[53:44] because the hope is you're hoping
[53:45] towards something that you really don't
[53:46] know anything about
[53:48] but faith is the substance when faith
[53:50] comes to you and you believe that you
[53:52] can see it
[53:53] how many of you saw jesus hanging on a
[53:55] cross none of us but we believe it's so
[53:58] strong that i can tell you about it
[54:00] right i've had the experience of it
[54:02] because why the spirit that was in that
[54:04] guy hanging on the cross is in me
[54:07] that's when i can read the word
[54:08] different than a baptist if he's not
[54:10] born again he's just reading letters on
[54:13] a page and getting a mental conception
[54:14] of what's going on but if you and i have
[54:16] become born again that born-again
[54:18] experience doesn't make you a good
[54:20] person
[54:23] it brings a very eternal god
[54:26] you had to believe a word you had to
[54:28] believe some words somebody told you
[54:31] something right to get you to believe
[54:34] and that anchored and you said hey i
[54:36] know that man died on a cross because
[54:38] the soul that was in that man is now in
[54:40] me
[54:43] i have to believe that
[54:45] to be a son and daughter of god you have
[54:47] to believe that
[54:48] right
[54:49] but if you just rely on hope you hinder
[54:51] faith now hope looks for something way
[54:53] off
[54:55] i hope
[54:56] i hope we're gonna we say it all the
[54:58] time people
[55:00] but we we're humans that's the human
[55:02] part
[55:04] oh we hope this is to be better we hope
[55:05] we're going to do this well no but faith
[55:08] claims it right now right see faith says
[55:12] god said so in his mind that settles it
[55:14] but hope says god said so and i'm
[55:16] expecting to get it someday
[55:19] prophesying
[55:21] right someday
[55:23] someday it's gonna happen to somebody
[55:25] else
[55:27] you see i'm expecting someday and as
[55:29] long as satan can put you off to another
[55:31] day
[55:33] that's as good as he wants that's right
[55:35] that's as good as he wants
[55:37] i don't want satan to have anything good
[55:40] he don't deserve anything good
[55:43] because faith stands up and takes over
[55:46] rule when faith speaks
[55:50] everything else keeps still
[55:54] everything else
[55:57] keeps still that's right all right let's
[55:59] go number two
[56:01] the sin of unbelief like abraham who
[56:03] called those things he were not as
[56:04] though they were he took god at his word
[56:06] believing that he was able to perform
[56:09] that what he had promised the trouble of
[56:11] it is with the church today
[56:15] that's us right
[56:16] the trouble of it is with the church
[56:18] today we come with hope
[56:20] instead of faith i hope brother dale's
[56:22] got something for me today
[56:30] you see what i'm saying
[56:33] i hope brother dale brings something for
[56:34] me today i hope god beats us here
[56:40] faith is positive
[56:42] faith needs no booster
[56:45] faith knows what it's talking about
[56:48] faith is strong
[56:50] faith has hairs on his chest
[56:52] it speaks and the rest of them shut up
[56:55] symptoms can't even speak at all when
[56:58] real godly faith speaks
[57:00] it's got the floor
[57:02] it knows where it's at
[57:04] why
[57:05] because it's had an experience
[57:07] it's had an experience with god if
[57:08] you've had an experience with god you
[57:10] can't take that experience away from me
[57:12] that i had
[57:14] 12 years 14 years ago you can't take it
[57:16] away because i was there
[57:18] i experienced it it wasn't something i'm
[57:21] still hoping for something that i have
[57:23] amen it's a possession all right let's
[57:26] go number three
[57:29] this is this queen of sheba that's what
[57:31] the church has done with these things
[57:33] with all these gifts of god you just pin
[57:35] them up
[57:37] they're not usable see let them loose
[57:40] exercise faith
[57:42] get some muscles in it
[57:44] let me tell you faith has got hair on
[57:46] the chest this is the second time he
[57:47] said that
[57:48] when faith speaks everything else sits
[57:51] down that's right that's right when it
[57:53] speaks everything else
[57:55] shuts up that's like we're talking about
[57:56] these doctrines
[57:58] these doctrines
[58:01] i guess you can fool people into having
[58:03] faith in them but you can't have faith
[58:05] in something that doesn't have a
[58:06] foundation
[58:07] a false doctrine does not have a
[58:09] foundation
[58:11] a false doctrine is like father son holy
[58:13] ghost and brother brown said that come
[58:14] from the pits of hell had no found no
[58:15] foundation
[58:17] my false doctrine has
[58:19] no foundation right all right number
[58:21] four
[58:23] 4a we're going to do 4b also
[58:26] i have a great faith to believe that one
[58:28] day before the coming of the lord that
[58:29] our little differences will be seven
[58:32] god may have to let communism sweep us
[58:34] together but something will take place
[58:36] that'll make us
[58:37] all one heart and one accord
[58:39] if we can't have faith now for healing
[58:42] how are we going to have rapturing faith
[58:45] we've got to have faith for the little
[58:47] things first
[58:50] first
[58:51] before the great things that's right all
[58:53] right so there'll be something that'll
[58:55] cause that's on that's in god's
[58:57] providence
[58:58] i do not know but i've seen a
[59:00] demonstration of it recently and that's
[59:02] what i want to tell you about all right
[59:04] let's go to number b
[59:05] god keeps his word 1957. so listen to
[59:09] this this is brother branham
[59:11] praying
[59:12] in sturgis
[59:16] michigan to a group of people
[59:19] but don't we believe he was talking to
[59:21] us every service
[59:22] we don't believe he was just talking to
[59:24] those people right we believe he talks
[59:26] to us every time he was talking he was
[59:28] speaking to you and i all right so he's
[59:30] not just talking to them so we pray he's
[59:32] praying to god he's praying a prayer for
[59:34] us
[59:35] so we pray that he will come tonight and
[59:38] interpret the word
[59:39] and the meanings that would create faith
[59:42] for the salvation of souls
[59:45] watch him
[59:47] and for the healing of bodies next
[59:50] and for the bringing of joy to the
[59:52] saints and establishing him that they
[59:55] might continue on
[59:58] now he had prayer there for the people
[1:00:00] that were sick or for the salvation of
[1:00:02] the soul then for the healing of the
[1:00:03] body then for bringing joy of those
[1:00:06] that's already been healed and don't
[1:00:07] need divine healing right at that time
[1:00:09] they need
[1:00:10] something else what was it the preaching
[1:00:12] of the word of god to establish them
[1:00:16] that they might continue on grant these
[1:00:19] blessings father and the forgiveness of
[1:00:20] our sins as we ask in jesus name so he's
[1:00:23] praying a prayer
[1:00:25] for you and i
[1:00:26] but watch the steps souls first healing
[1:00:29] next and then bringing joys to the
[1:00:31] saints and establishing them how are you
[1:00:33] going to be established how do you get
[1:00:34] established
[1:00:36] you get established in the word right
[1:00:38] right because the words were the
[1:00:39] foundation heaven earth will pass away
[1:00:41] but my word
[1:00:42] will not fail will not pass away all
[1:00:44] right
[1:00:45] so now
[1:00:47] here's our problem
[1:00:50] we must have
[1:00:52] this substance
[1:00:54] before we can speak it
[1:00:58] you gotta have substance faith before
[1:00:59] you can speak so don't just start saying
[1:01:02] faith speaks and you just start speaking
[1:01:03] because remember you can speak a myth
[1:01:06] brother brown said you be careful
[1:01:08] you can take something off of a person
[1:01:10] that god put on them remember right you
[1:01:13] can take something off of a person that
[1:01:14] god meant to stay on that person he said
[1:01:16] you have to be careful
[1:01:19] all right i've got a quote in here
[1:01:20] somewhere i don't know if i put it in or
[1:01:22] not
[1:01:23] but he said in the prayer line
[1:01:25] he was telling the people he said if
[1:01:26] you've got unconfessed sins he said you
[1:01:28] better put it under the blood now
[1:01:30] because when we start this prayer line
[1:01:32] god can go all the way back in your life
[1:01:34] why
[1:01:35] he's going back into their life to get
[1:01:37] their life right first
[1:01:41] right
[1:01:42] then to bring faith for their healing
[1:01:45] all right that's one that he said a
[1:01:46] christian wouldn't get a lot of times
[1:01:48] wouldn't get healing because
[1:01:50] our mentality is oh we did this wrong we
[1:01:52] did this wrong we did this wrong we did
[1:01:53] this wrong we did this wrong wow there
[1:01:55] was a consciousness of sin right so we
[1:01:57] couldn't we block our we block faith
[1:02:01] faith is not weak
[1:02:03] faith is perfect faith is strong faith
[1:02:05] has hair on his chest
[1:02:08] has teeth
[1:02:10] sometimes we take all that away
[1:02:13] and we make faith weak by what we do
[1:02:16] i said by what we do that's right
[1:02:20] but you must have the substance to speak
[1:02:22] it but you can't speak it remember the
[1:02:25] resurrection was not spoken
[1:02:27] out in the graveyard to a bunch of dead
[1:02:29] people
[1:02:31] right
[1:02:31] who heard it
[1:02:33] live people
[1:02:34] so you got to speak to live people
[1:02:36] somebody's got to be able to hear it all
[1:02:38] right so that's you and i so i'm
[1:02:40] building up something because we've got
[1:02:41] to build on something what i what i see
[1:02:44] our problem is lula georgia included
[1:02:48] we think we're up there at the headstone
[1:02:55] and we don't have faith enough to act
[1:02:56] right
[1:02:58] i said faith enough to act right
[1:03:00] we don't i'll read you something just a
[1:03:02] minute i'm
[1:03:04] i didn't just put these together
[1:03:06] for anything
[1:03:07] but there's an approach to it
[1:03:10] because remember what's brother dale
[1:03:11] been preaching go back and read
[1:03:13] those combat bees what do they do
[1:03:18] combat beasts didn't run out there and
[1:03:19] say here's the third seal
[1:03:22] starting with the first one that's right
[1:03:24] right right
[1:03:26] here's number four when it's supposed to
[1:03:27] be two
[1:03:28] because what is the combat beast where
[1:03:30] did that come from that comes from the
[1:03:32] holy ghost the combat beast is your holy
[1:03:34] ghost
[1:03:35] lion ox man and eagle that's the holy
[1:03:37] ghost and what does that be say
[1:03:40] that beast steps out and says
[1:03:42] come
[1:03:44] and see
[1:03:46] come and
[1:03:47] understand
[1:03:49] not physically see right sure john
[1:03:52] physically saw and wrote it down that's
[1:03:54] what he was told to do
[1:03:56] but not you and i right we get not the
[1:03:59] symbol we get the revelation
[1:04:01] so to see is to what understand so the
[1:04:05] combat beast in your life
[1:04:08] is saying come
[1:04:09] and understand that's right right come
[1:04:12] and understand what i've already spoke
[1:04:14] yes
[1:04:16] don't the symbol is there for us in our
[1:04:19] finite brains to comprehend at one
[1:04:21] period of time but that doesn't stay
[1:04:24] horse rider well i was right no there's
[1:04:26] a revelation to go with that that's
[1:04:28] right same thing with the daniel 70
[1:04:30] weeks not always dates and times and
[1:04:32] seasons which is exactly perfectly right
[1:04:34] if you know what if you know what you're
[1:04:36] talking about in the word of god but
[1:04:38] it's a plan of redemption glory it's a
[1:04:41] it's a it's a parable we're going to see
[1:04:42] it next sunday it's a parable with an
[1:04:44] underlying meaning
[1:04:46] same way with the combat be same way
[1:04:48] with the seals because we don't get the
[1:04:49] physical seeing of the seal open right
[1:04:52] see it with our physical eyes you better
[1:04:54] not that's right but we get the
[1:04:56] revelation by seeing understanding
[1:05:01] that's why i said
[1:05:02] if you're gonna throw the daniel 70
[1:05:03] week's book out you might as well throw
[1:05:04] the seal book out that's right that's
[1:05:06] right because this other jews you might
[1:05:08] as well throw feasts of the trumpets out
[1:05:10] you might as well throw all these other
[1:05:11] things out revelations five and six and
[1:05:13] seven and eight and nine ten eleven
[1:05:15] twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixty
[1:05:17] seventeen eighteen
[1:05:18] terry bible throw it away because it's
[1:05:20] not two of us but we got to have the
[1:05:22] spiritual revelation to get us out of
[1:05:24] here because that spiritual revelation
[1:05:26] has got to come up out of that paper
[1:05:29] that revelation has got to come out of
[1:05:30] that paper
[1:05:33] listen to this
[1:05:34] not just the two witnesses first
[1:05:38] it's got to come up to you and me first
[1:05:40] right
[1:05:42] without you and i taking a body change
[1:05:45] they don't go to israel
[1:05:48] because a man of sin has to come down
[1:05:52] when we go up
[1:05:54] we become incarnate god
[1:05:56] he doesn't know how to do that yet
[1:05:59] it's a devil in that pope
[1:06:02] but when it comes to the time to where
[1:06:03] that devil is going to move out of the
[1:06:05] way and the big guy's going to come in
[1:06:07] same way with you and i right right
[1:06:10] same way with you and i we get the
[1:06:11] earnest of our inheritance sure we get
[1:06:14] the baptism of the holy ghost and that
[1:06:15] puts us in a rapture but to take a body
[1:06:18] change we need the man himself
[1:06:22] we need the holy ghost himself
[1:06:24] christ
[1:06:25] to come down and so take care of this
[1:06:27] being to us and god or the same person
[1:06:30] and he can change that body we go up
[1:06:32] satan comes down and says oh that's how
[1:06:34] you do it
[1:06:35] so he goes and incarnates the pope and
[1:06:37] says now i
[1:06:39] i'm here to take over
[1:06:40] but two prophets are going to take a
[1:06:42] revelation that we had
[1:06:44] it's not gonna be us going over there
[1:06:46] and speaking it to them but remember
[1:06:50] if we stay silent
[1:06:53] if we stay silent
[1:06:54] there's nothing to be said right that's
[1:06:56] right
[1:06:57] but we gotta speak
[1:06:59] jesus said speak to this mountain can't
[1:07:02] say write it down on a piece of paper
[1:07:04] he said speak to this mountain
[1:07:07] and it'll be moved so speaking has a lot
[1:07:09] to do with that's what really caught me
[1:07:10] when they were talking about faith
[1:07:12] because faith has to speak
[1:07:14] faith can't stay silent
[1:07:17] it has to speak from you not just from
[1:07:19] me or brother dale it's got to come from
[1:07:22] your mouth
[1:07:24] the word of faith you preach
[1:07:28] think about that
[1:07:29] but the combat beast says come and
[1:07:31] understand
[1:07:32] what the one inside of you
[1:07:34] glory not over here
[1:07:37] john got the over here to see the simple
[1:07:39] but you and i that combat beast every
[1:07:42] sunday every time you turn on the tape
[1:07:44] every time you come on wednesday night
[1:07:46] every time you talk between each other
[1:07:47] that combat beast rises up and says hey
[1:07:49] come here i'll show you something that's
[1:07:50] right
[1:07:51] come here i want to show you something
[1:07:53] this is what i was talking about
[1:07:55] this is what i was talking about that's
[1:07:56] why you guys have a perfect word if you
[1:07:58] got a perfect god inside of you you're
[1:07:59] gonna have a perfect word
[1:08:01] and you're gonna be able to speak
[1:08:03] be therefore perfect that's right
[1:08:05] even as your father in heaven all right
[1:08:07] number five we got it up here
[1:08:10] oh this is it right here all right
[1:08:13] so watch the approach
[1:08:15] brother brown says here a few nights ago
[1:08:17] saw a woman people when they come to the
[1:08:18] platform ugly vulgar things that they've
[1:08:20] done down in their life now remember
[1:08:22] friends those things are told publicly
[1:08:24] right here before this audience what
[1:08:26] you've done in your life is told right
[1:08:27] here so if there's anything upon your
[1:08:29] heart and you do not wish it to be known
[1:08:32] stay out of the prayer line if you don't
[1:08:33] want to be known
[1:08:35] unless that you come with a perfect
[1:08:37] faith
[1:08:38] or ask god to forgive you
[1:08:42] and put it under the blood in the sea of
[1:08:44] forgetfulness and whatever it is because
[1:08:46] i will not be responsible for what is
[1:08:49] said
[1:08:50] but what been brought out because it's
[1:08:52] in your life that's coming out
[1:08:55] right right
[1:08:57] so the approach to that is what
[1:09:00] we have to become let's look at number
[1:09:02] six we have to
[1:09:04] become right
[1:09:10] because righteousness
[1:09:13] being means
[1:09:15] being right
[1:09:17] that's just a simple way of saying well
[1:09:19] to be righteous
[1:09:20] means to be right
[1:09:22] the righteousness of god all right let's
[1:09:24] read this
[1:09:25] all right here we are blasphemous name
[1:09:34] let's just read the the part that's
[1:09:35] underlined and the biggest part of our
[1:09:37] faith is mental faith
[1:09:39] by hearing the word it brings us to a
[1:09:41] mental recognition of god
[1:09:44] all right but if this that's capital
[1:09:47] t-h-i-f-t-a-t cap but it's this coming
[1:09:50] from above oh brother if it ever strikes
[1:09:53] this there is a godly spiritual faith
[1:09:56] then what does that faith do that faith
[1:09:58] recognizes only the word
[1:10:01] all right and when the word itself is
[1:10:03] pouring into our faith our mental faith
[1:10:05] becomes a spiritual
[1:10:07] revelation now look he's in blasphemous
[1:10:10] names what's he preaching
[1:10:11] he's preaching the spirituality part of
[1:10:14] that right there remember he preached
[1:10:15] the statue of a perfect man and then
[1:10:17] sometime later he's preached blasphemous
[1:10:19] names all right read blasphemous names
[1:10:21] it'll really help you on your statue of
[1:10:24] a perfect man because he goes through
[1:10:25] each one here but watch the spiritual
[1:10:27] part of this not a fundamental
[1:10:28] conception of church joining a mental
[1:10:30] conception of that but upon the
[1:10:32] revelation when them
[1:10:34] streams of grace has poured into that
[1:10:36] mental faith that you've got
[1:10:38] then upon this a spiritual revelation
[1:10:42] but the five strings now what he done
[1:10:44] was as far as i know and from what i
[1:10:46] remember
[1:10:47] he drew this again
[1:10:49] or when he drew it he was talking about
[1:10:51] sister shepard's dream
[1:10:54] where she you know where she sees him
[1:10:56] whip the top off of the pyramid and and
[1:10:58] and then look down in it and then
[1:11:01] the red the part that she had was she
[1:11:03] said she saw water start coming out
[1:11:05] remember start the water started coming
[1:11:06] out the top of the pyramid and flowing
[1:11:08] down and it was trash
[1:11:13] still going up the statue of perfect man
[1:11:15] yeah we got trash
[1:11:18] we got trash yet we got to get cleaned
[1:11:19] out but that's what it was doing right
[1:11:21] washington the water by the word the
[1:11:23] word comes in waters it and what does it
[1:11:25] do from the inside out
[1:11:28] right it wasn't raining on the pyramid
[1:11:31] it was falling water from the inside out
[1:11:33] all right
[1:11:35] but the five streams you see coming down
[1:11:37] through here tempers this together he's
[1:11:40] talking about he's got little lines
[1:11:41] running down through here
[1:11:42] it tempers all this together because i
[1:11:45] swear a lot of people have a problem
[1:11:46] they think well you gotta you gotta go
[1:11:48] all the way up there and get the holy
[1:11:49] ghost where it says holy spirit no
[1:11:50] that's
[1:11:51] that's
[1:11:52] that's a not a different holy spirit
[1:11:54] that's a different dip
[1:11:56] in the holy spirit i'm talking about
[1:11:58] water here so let's go to the dippin
[1:12:01] the holy spirit is right here you can't
[1:12:02] have faith without having the new birth
[1:12:05] you can't have godly virtue knowledge
[1:12:07] and all this will happen in your birth
[1:12:08] but when you get to right here that's
[1:12:10] what molds everything together that's
[1:12:12] when god can begin to start trusting you
[1:12:15] more right that's right
[1:12:17] that's right the reason we don't we
[1:12:20] all of us
[1:12:21] are not further down the road than we
[1:12:23] are is god is not able to trust us
[1:12:27] with what we've got that's right because
[1:12:30] we've been using it wrong that's right
[1:12:32] and i don't mean wrong as in sinning but
[1:12:34] brother i said we sin every day
[1:12:36] so we must be doing something wrong not
[1:12:38] something to lose our salvation but our
[1:12:40] call is not just to just show it by
[1:12:42] faith
[1:12:43] it's to get out of here
[1:12:45] all right so we gotta have a perfect
[1:12:47] substance faith to get out of here not
[1:12:49] just the faith but the five strings you
[1:12:51] see coming down through here tempers
[1:12:52] this together and it's been the holy
[1:12:54] spirit that made the ephesus church
[1:12:56] it was the holy spirit that birthed the
[1:12:58] smyrna church he's going look he's going
[1:13:00] up the line
[1:13:01] it's the holy spirit that gives the
[1:13:02] pergamos church the entire church in the
[1:13:04] arcade it's the holy spirit that built
[1:13:06] that bride the elect that's pulled out
[1:13:08] of all the organizational systems down
[1:13:09] through the ages like that
[1:13:11] there's an elected a predestinated bride
[1:13:13] of jesus christ that the holy spirit has
[1:13:16] called out the elect and it's been the
[1:13:17] holy ghost in this age that age that
[1:13:20] that that that on up to the top the holy
[1:13:23] spirit so he proves it right there spend
[1:13:25] the holy spirit in the ages
[1:13:27] all right
[1:13:29] but they've had a dip
[1:13:32] they had the same water we got
[1:13:34] they got it in a small portion
[1:13:36] all right
[1:13:37] and now as in the individuals
[1:13:40] we're gentiles right
[1:13:42] right we get it individually
[1:13:45] these virtues and things our knowledge
[1:13:47] and temperance is added to our faith
[1:13:49] then when the capstone comes the holy
[1:13:52] spirit cements it together there is the
[1:13:55] baptism of the holy spirit that's why
[1:13:57] it's so short today
[1:13:59] he's not going back to the baptism of
[1:14:00] the holy ghost that puts you in the body
[1:14:02] he's talking about the baptism of the
[1:14:04] holy ghost it puts you at adoption where
[1:14:06] god can use you he's not going to use a
[1:14:08] novice he if he gave
[1:14:12] me if he gave you patience
[1:14:15] we were talking about patience today
[1:14:17] he said he didn't want the kind that
[1:14:18] made tribulation
[1:14:20] because tribulation work is patient
[1:14:21] right i said well buddy you're in bad
[1:14:23] shape because to get up there you gotta
[1:14:25] have a little tribulation and i'm not
[1:14:27] going to tell you what he's saying
[1:14:28] about being married to tribulation
[1:14:35] did i just say no
[1:14:37] sorry
[1:14:39] your coupon for that
[1:14:43] get your lap a little bit
[1:14:44] but listen tribulation working patience
[1:14:46] but to get up through there god's not
[1:14:48] going to just give you these virtues and
[1:14:51] and you be it's just like a kid a kid's
[1:14:53] not you give a kid a gun
[1:14:55] i i was telling him yesterday somebody
[1:14:57] came down to work the other day and
[1:14:59] bought a car
[1:15:00] well we have to prove where they live so
[1:15:02] he had a phone bill
[1:15:04] six pages long
[1:15:08] it was over
[1:15:09] thousand dollars cell phone bill
[1:15:14] somebody looked down and said two
[1:15:16] thousand dollars
[1:15:17] he said yeah don't ever give your son
[1:15:19] which was eight years old sitting right
[1:15:21] beside of him don't ever give him an
[1:15:23] iphone and give him internet access
[1:15:28] i started to go man do you let him drive
[1:15:33] and that little boy was like yeah
[1:15:34] thousand dollars that was mine
[1:15:38] and i said i wasn't with you son i said
[1:15:40] i'd whip your daddy
[1:15:42] i said man you ought to know better than
[1:15:44] to give a boy that's like giving a
[1:15:45] little kid a gun what is this
[1:15:48] that's what god is with the virtues i'm
[1:15:50] trying to make a point here god's not
[1:15:52] going to give you a virtue that you're
[1:15:53] going to shoot yourself between the eyes
[1:15:55] with
[1:15:56] he's going to give you that virtue when
[1:15:58] you're ready
[1:16:00] not before
[1:16:01] because remember power without character
[1:16:04] is satanic you can use every one of
[1:16:06] these virtues against people and against
[1:16:09] god
[1:16:10] you can
[1:16:12] but not the godly ones you can't not the
[1:16:14] ones that god seals by the holy ghost he
[1:16:17] knows you've got knowledge and he knows
[1:16:18] you'll treat the word right guess what
[1:16:21] you'll have knowledge don't worry
[1:16:23] you'll have godly knowledge
[1:16:25] you'll be able to explain the word of
[1:16:27] god not to to a degree of of maybe a
[1:16:31] minister but you know what
[1:16:33] the bible says you need to give a reason
[1:16:34] of the hope that lies within you
[1:16:37] stated to show yourself approved right
[1:16:41] you don't have to prove me
[1:16:43] god's going to prove me or not one of
[1:16:44] the two he's going to prove me or not
[1:16:46] approve me one of the two same thing
[1:16:47] with you all right but you see what
[1:16:49] brother brown was saying he's saying
[1:16:51] this and this and this you're going up
[1:16:52] now coming from the holy spirit what has
[1:16:54] come
[1:16:55] then he will give to you
[1:16:57] supernatural faith
[1:17:00] he give you faith down here
[1:17:02] to get into the body be earnest of your
[1:17:04] inheritance brother brown said a little
[1:17:06] button
[1:17:07] you know what he said a little button
[1:17:10] that button is as eternal as god is but
[1:17:13] it's a little button
[1:17:14] it has
[1:17:16] limitations
[1:17:18] that you put on it not it you put on it
[1:17:20] right same substance as in the ocean is
[1:17:22] in a teaspoon but it's just a teaspoon
[1:17:25] all right
[1:17:26] but there's a whole ocean out there
[1:17:29] but you say i just want a little
[1:17:30] teaspoon no i want the whole ocean
[1:17:32] because that's what he said now coming
[1:17:34] from the holy spirit what has come then
[1:17:36] he will give to you supernatural faith
[1:17:41] spiritual faith
[1:17:44] that here at the bottom then that
[1:17:46] spiritual faith recognizes only the word
[1:17:50] no matter what anybody else says it
[1:17:52] don't it don't do no good
[1:17:54] that only knows the word
[1:17:58] that faith only knows the word that's
[1:18:00] real spiritual faith see
[1:18:02] then that was number one number one
[1:18:04] coming to you your mental faith right
[1:18:06] here comes the holy spirit comes down
[1:18:08] into your mental faith makes it a
[1:18:11] spiritual faith
[1:18:12] then the spiritual faith only recognizes
[1:18:14] the word down right and number two three
[1:18:17] then you'll have spiritual you'll have
[1:18:18] to have the holy spirit and will seal
[1:18:21] all these things into you
[1:18:23] as the holy spirit covers this you see
[1:18:25] what he's talking about
[1:18:27] the holy spirit's covering all these
[1:18:30] not baby form but i'm talking about up
[1:18:32] here where you're an adult right
[1:18:35] where god can use you
[1:18:39] i want to be used
[1:18:40] glory i want to be used by god right
[1:18:43] right we've been used by the world long
[1:18:45] enough
[1:18:46] we let the world use us for a long time
[1:18:48] didn't we
[1:18:49] how about unless you saying god uses for
[1:18:51] a while
[1:18:52] and number two three then you have
[1:18:53] spiritual you'll have to have the holy
[1:18:55] spirit and it will seal all these things
[1:18:57] into you as that holy spirit covers this
[1:18:59] from your faith up to the holy spirit
[1:19:01] seals you in with christ then you become
[1:19:04] one amen you become one see you and
[1:19:06] christ live together at that day you'll
[1:19:08] know that i am in the father father and
[1:19:10] me i and you and you and me see that
[1:19:12] then that's a sealed unit of the lord
[1:19:15] god now amen
[1:19:17] and then they are vindicated
[1:19:20] and placed when that time takes place
[1:19:23] they become vindicated
[1:19:26] not just sons and daughters
[1:19:28] they become vindicated
[1:19:30] sons and daughters of god all right
[1:19:34] go to the next one
[1:19:36] keep going it's just blasphemous names
[1:19:38] just keep going
[1:19:39] now when the member is born by the holy
[1:19:41] ghost into the family of god and has
[1:19:43] proven
[1:19:45] to have these virtues in him that god
[1:19:47] can see virtue knowledge temperance
[1:19:49] patience brother kindness and godliness
[1:19:50] in him then god seals him or places him
[1:19:53] and there that's when you see the sons
[1:19:55] and daughters of god
[1:19:57] all right
[1:19:58] so everybody with me now you got you got
[1:20:00] your faith down here at the bottom and
[1:20:02] then you keep going and you keep going
[1:20:03] and it keeps becoming a substance
[1:20:07] as you walk with god it becomes a
[1:20:09] substance it just keeps going it keeps
[1:20:11] getting bigger and bigger and bigger
[1:20:13] and then now let's let's go to uh
[1:20:16] to the next one
[1:20:17] should be romans 10.
[1:20:20] listen to this
[1:20:21] romans 10 verse 6 but the righteousness
[1:20:24] which is of faith speaketh
[1:20:27] that's ongoing not just one time
[1:20:28] speaketh
[1:20:30] on this wise say not in thy heart who
[1:20:33] shall ascend into heaven
[1:20:35] that is to bring christ down from above
[1:20:38] in other words why are you saying your
[1:20:39] heart that god's got to come from
[1:20:40] somewhere
[1:20:42] is that always saying
[1:20:44] or who shall descend into the deep that
[1:20:46] is to bring up christ again from the
[1:20:48] dead but what saith it what is the it
[1:20:53] righteousness amen
[1:20:55] what is it
[1:20:56] when you have righteousness which is
[1:20:58] rightness these little things in our
[1:21:00] life we got to get rid of
[1:21:03] right but we got to have faith it's not
[1:21:05] going to do any good to sit here and
[1:21:07] you know you can look people straight in
[1:21:08] the eye and if
[1:21:09] we just don't repent anymore
[1:21:12] we don't we just go oh that's a good
[1:21:15] sermon
[1:21:18] still going to do the same thing you
[1:21:19] were doing before
[1:21:21] but what sayeth it in other words what
[1:21:23] say so it must be something speaking
[1:21:25] what saith it
[1:21:27] the word is nigh they even in thy mouth
[1:21:30] and in thy heart that is the word of
[1:21:32] faith which we preach that thou shalt
[1:21:34] confess with thy mouth in other words
[1:21:36] speak
[1:21:39] with thy mouth the lord jesus and shall
[1:21:40] believe in that heart that god hath
[1:21:42] raised him from the dead thou shalt be
[1:21:44] saved
[1:21:46] for the heart of man
[1:21:48] believeth unto rightness
[1:21:50] and with a mouth confession is made unto
[1:21:52] salvation you've got to confess it for
[1:21:55] the scripture saith whosoever believeth
[1:21:57] on him shall not be ashamed for there is
[1:21:59] no difference between the jews and the
[1:22:00] greek for the same lord over all is rich
[1:22:03] unto all that call upon his name for
[1:22:05] whosoever shall call upon in that call
[1:22:08] speak speak
[1:22:11] call upon the name of the lord shall be
[1:22:12] saved
[1:22:13] how then shall they call on him and whom
[1:22:15] they have not believed
[1:22:19] the question
[1:22:21] how are you going to call on somebody
[1:22:22] you just really don't believe in that's
[1:22:24] right right
[1:22:27] right
[1:22:28] and how shall they believe in him of
[1:22:30] whom they have not heard that's right
[1:22:33] and how shall they hear
[1:22:35] without a preacher
[1:22:37] so we got it here it's got to be spoken
[1:22:39] but we got to hear it and then act on it
[1:22:41] right all right now listen
[1:22:46] if you speak
[1:22:48] if you speak right with rightness
[1:22:51] he's got to hear you right right because
[1:22:53] it's him him speaking that's right
[1:22:56] that's right it's not you
[1:22:58] it's him that's doing the speaking
[1:23:00] that's right he knows what you need he
[1:23:02] knows what you want
[1:23:03] but if you just sit there
[1:23:05] and don't say anything and don't claim
[1:23:07] anything and don't claim you know the
[1:23:09] blessings of god then then
[1:23:12] you're just an unbeliever right
[1:23:15] that makes you an unbeliever
[1:23:17] all right
[1:23:19] now let's go to the next scripture
[1:23:25] god having provided some better thing
[1:23:27] for us
[1:23:29] we know this one that they without us
[1:23:31] should not be made perfect
[1:23:34] now what's hebrews 11 hebrews 11 is the
[1:23:37] great hall of fame of faith right by
[1:23:39] faith this one did by faith this one did
[1:23:41] by faith but god summoned every bit of
[1:23:43] it up down to one scripture
[1:23:46] all that faith was fine
[1:23:48] for their time
[1:23:50] but that faith
[1:23:52] without our faith
[1:23:55] they can't be made perfect
[1:23:58] their faith without our faith i'm not
[1:24:00] changing the scripture i don't believe i
[1:24:02] think that's okay
[1:24:03] because god hasn't provided some better
[1:24:05] thing for us
[1:24:07] that they that have faith
[1:24:10] but without our faith nobody's gonna be
[1:24:12] made perfect
[1:24:14] all right let's go to the next scripture
[1:24:17] i want you to listen to this and and
[1:24:19] for we know in part
[1:24:21] and we prophesy in part
[1:24:24] but when that which is perfect has come
[1:24:27] then that which is in part shall be done
[1:24:29] away
[1:24:30] now we're not going to do away when that
[1:24:32] which is perfect has come
[1:24:35] we receive faith down here right with
[1:24:37] the new birth but when this comes we're
[1:24:39] not going to do away with this but i
[1:24:40] like what brother tim tim pruitt said
[1:24:43] brother tim pruitt said
[1:24:45] that which is in part
[1:24:47] won't do now
[1:24:53] that which is in part won't do now
[1:24:56] it'd do for them
[1:24:59] but that which is perfect has come and
[1:25:01] we believe that's true the perfect
[1:25:02] vindicated word has been brought to us
[1:25:04] right and that which is in part
[1:25:07] won't do us any good anymore that's
[1:25:08] right
[1:25:09] not done away with
[1:25:11] it just won't get us in the body like i
[1:25:12] said about justification and
[1:25:14] sanctification you can be justified and
[1:25:16] sanctify and go to hell
[1:25:20] but wesley couldn't be sanctified and go
[1:25:23] to hell
[1:25:24] his sanctification put him in the body
[1:25:26] because he had faith for his time
[1:25:28] he wasn't required he didn't have a
[1:25:30] prophet that would come and break the
[1:25:32] word open and say hey you need faith you
[1:25:34] need virtue you need knowledge it's good
[1:25:36] not to drink tea because it has no value
[1:25:38] it's good enough to do this and do's and
[1:25:39] don'ts that's why they're called
[1:25:40] methodists they have a method of doing
[1:25:42] things right that's exactly why it's
[1:25:44] called methodist but it's john wesley's
[1:25:46] teaching but that was good for the time
[1:25:48] because what was god doing though god
[1:25:50] was getting the people to realize this
[1:25:51] and realize this i've said many times
[1:25:53] before if brother branham would have
[1:25:54] came on the scene there had been no
[1:25:56] pentecostal age if brother brown would
[1:25:57] have come on scene right after the
[1:25:58] methodist people wouldn't have been able
[1:26:00] to handle it
[1:26:01] with the signs and the wonders and the
[1:26:03] miracles that he had there had to be a
[1:26:05] justification there had to be a
[1:26:06] sanctification of people that got ready
[1:26:09] and then a pentecostal people that the
[1:26:10] holy ghost fell in the gift we'll see
[1:26:12] here brother brown steps right out at
[1:26:14] him buddy he's right in the middle of
[1:26:15] the gift
[1:26:16] so they accepted that and the people
[1:26:18] accepted it but that was just the bait
[1:26:19] on the hook for him
[1:26:21] it put azusa street in the body of
[1:26:23] christ
[1:26:25] but it started his platform for to build
[1:26:27] a perfect faith
[1:26:29] every bit of that was headed toward me
[1:26:31] and you
[1:26:32] amen
[1:26:35] that was his purpose
[1:26:37] he said it's gone from you you're not
[1:26:39] even supposed to get it right amen
[1:26:41] that's right
[1:26:42] in other words it's coming
[1:26:44] amen but now we don't say it's coming we
[1:26:46] say it's here
[1:26:48] the word of faith
[1:26:50] you speak
[1:26:53] but number seven
[1:26:57] perfect faith your genuine faith will do
[1:27:00] it right here your genuine faith will
[1:27:01] make it so real to you that look at that
[1:27:04] little woman with a blood issue and when
[1:27:06] she touched it to prove that it stopped
[1:27:08] it stopped jesus turned and said who
[1:27:09] touched me that perfect
[1:27:11] faith and that same see but now remember
[1:27:14] the woman came with a perfect faith for
[1:27:16] that time right now her perfect faith
[1:27:20] at that time
[1:27:22] wouldn't even put us in the body of
[1:27:23] christ
[1:27:24] she had faith
[1:27:26] she had faith that god would heal her
[1:27:29] right right but that's the faith for
[1:27:32] that
[1:27:33] time and we got to have that
[1:27:35] i hope you get one i'm i'm trying to
[1:27:37] build something because faith has got to
[1:27:39] come in stages yes right
[1:27:42] my brother said we're praying for the
[1:27:44] faith to save souls tonight we're
[1:27:46] praying for the faith to heal the bodies
[1:27:48] tonight we're praying for the faith of
[1:27:49] the people that already have the new
[1:27:51] birth and already are healed we're we're
[1:27:53] having faith that they'll enjoy this and
[1:27:55] that they'll use this and build their
[1:27:56] self up and that's what you and i got to
[1:27:58] do we can't just say well i'm going to
[1:28:00] have faith
[1:28:01] you can't do that that's right
[1:28:04] and honestly it'll blow us away if god
[1:28:06] give us everything at one time
[1:28:08] we can't handle it as human finite being
[1:28:11] but as but as an infinite god starts
[1:28:14] changing you and i
[1:28:16] listen to this starts changing you and i
[1:28:19] we can handle it that way
[1:28:22] a little at a time
[1:28:23] add to your faith virtue
[1:28:26] knowledge tempest all right let's go to
[1:28:28] the next one
[1:28:32] all right listen perfect faith jesus had
[1:28:33] perfect faith he had it and it come
[1:28:36] because he was the word
[1:28:40] everybody says glory hallelujah
[1:28:42] but let's don't stop
[1:28:44] and you become the word
[1:28:46] you become the word as you receive the
[1:28:48] word if you abide in me my words in you
[1:28:51] my words which this word abides in me
[1:28:54] then ask what you will and it'll be done
[1:28:56] for you see if you say to this mountain
[1:28:59] be moved and don't doubt but believe in
[1:29:01] what you've said
[1:29:03] believe in what you've said amen
[1:29:07] then you shall have what you said
[1:29:10] when you pray believe that you receive
[1:29:13] what you ask for and you shall have it
[1:29:15] it will be given to you time space
[1:29:18] nothing else will ever change it you
[1:29:20] know it's done
[1:29:22] it's already it's already
[1:29:24] over with all right let's go to the next
[1:29:26] one
[1:29:30] but jesus is still out of perfect faith
[1:29:32] but jesus lived in a world that no one
[1:29:34] knowed about right he was an odd person
[1:29:37] he lived in a world of perfect faith in
[1:29:38] the perfect god in which he was
[1:29:41] right if we lived in a perfect faith of
[1:29:43] a christian
[1:29:45] to what we are
[1:29:47] we'd be a mystic to the world
[1:29:52] now i want to ask y'all something
[1:29:55] are you a mystic to the world or do you
[1:29:58] just mingle with the world and
[1:30:00] they can't tell the difference in you
[1:30:01] and the next guy or gal
[1:30:04] i'm just going to ask you that question
[1:30:07] because you're going to have to answer
[1:30:08] it not me
[1:30:10] you understand what i'm saying
[1:30:12] your house should be built on on
[1:30:14] christian principles your faith should
[1:30:16] be built on christian principles your
[1:30:19] work should be built on christian
[1:30:20] principles you should be built on
[1:30:22] christian principles if you're a
[1:30:24] christian
[1:30:26] if you're not your house is going to
[1:30:27] fall
[1:30:28] you've got pretend faith you've got
[1:30:30] pretend virtue pretend knowledge we got
[1:30:32] to quit pretending if we're wrong we're
[1:30:35] wrong and you know what the bible gives
[1:30:36] us something to be right that's why i
[1:30:38] say we ought to know that we're wrong
[1:30:40] and i think that's what the problem is
[1:30:41] because the bible says in the end time
[1:30:44] iniquity will abound not sin iniquity
[1:30:46] will abound what is iniquity knowing
[1:30:49] you're doing it right and not doing
[1:30:51] anything about it
[1:30:52] that's right
[1:30:54] the mystery of iniquity
[1:30:56] what a mystery of it is
[1:30:58] we're doing things that we know we
[1:30:59] shouldn't do
[1:31:00] and we just keep on doing it
[1:31:02] and we want god to bless us and want god
[1:31:04] to do these things for us we want god to
[1:31:06] make have faith in god
[1:31:09] have faith in what god said
[1:31:12] but jesus said in the world that no one
[1:31:14] knows he was an odd person he lived in
[1:31:15] the world perfect faith and a perfect
[1:31:17] god in which he was if we lived in a
[1:31:19] perfect faith of a christian
[1:31:21] to what we are we'd be a mystic to the
[1:31:23] world exactly
[1:31:25] you know we trying to like the guy says
[1:31:26] we try to get on the fence well the
[1:31:28] devil owns the fence that's right
[1:31:31] the bible says flee
[1:31:33] flee
[1:31:36] from it don't try to camp around it
[1:31:38] that's right
[1:31:40] you'd walk in the spirit what the spirit
[1:31:42] said you would do
[1:31:44] what if it forbid
[1:31:47] you would not do
[1:31:48] then the people began to say that you'd
[1:31:50] be a mystic to them that's the way it is
[1:31:52] to all believers there are mystic the
[1:31:54] disciples couldn't understand him when
[1:31:56] he spoke to them
[1:31:59] you know they say this you know in other
[1:32:00] words they're talking riddles
[1:32:02] and he was
[1:32:04] he was talking in parables he'd have to
[1:32:06] stop every once in a while and he'd have
[1:32:07] to explain what he was saying right why
[1:32:09] they didn't have the holy ghost but when
[1:32:10] peter stood up on the day of pentecost
[1:32:13] that's what i was trying to get the
[1:32:15] people to see
[1:32:16] last weekend even the ministers to see
[1:32:19] that
[1:32:19] that you know
[1:32:21] do we have to have a quote like brother
[1:32:22] claude said brother claus said uh
[1:32:25] if not
[1:32:39] hang and available you
[1:32:41] so but what are we doing here what do we
[1:32:43] need a verbatim quote for everything
[1:32:46] jesus said
[1:32:48] eat my flesh
[1:32:50] and drink my blood
[1:32:52] or you will have no part with a son of
[1:32:54] man
[1:32:57] and he didn't stop and take two hours to
[1:32:59] explain it
[1:33:01] paul was a holy ghost
[1:33:04] several years 20 or 30 years later paul
[1:33:06] picks it up in corinthians and daddy
[1:33:08] reads that every time we have to take
[1:33:09] communion
[1:33:11] i have been given this from the lord
[1:33:13] paul wasn't even there that night
[1:33:16] but the holy ghost
[1:33:18] took what jesus said
[1:33:20] and broke it down and said hey
[1:33:22] this is the cup
[1:33:24] and which is my blood
[1:33:26] that's being shed for you this is the
[1:33:28] bread this is the broken body this is my
[1:33:30] body which i've broken for you you see
[1:33:33] what happens with the holy ghost we
[1:33:35] might not verbatim quote everything and
[1:33:36] we might have a quote for everything
[1:33:38] that we do but
[1:33:39] or everything that we say but if if if
[1:33:41] it rings right with the rest of the
[1:33:43] bible and if it rings right with the
[1:33:44] prophet's message then i'm all right
[1:33:46] with that
[1:33:48] eat my flesh and drink my blood they
[1:33:50] thought he was a vampire
[1:33:52] but paul picks it up 20 years later why
[1:33:54] didn't peter do that
[1:33:56] peter was a prophet
[1:33:58] peter was sitting there that night
[1:34:00] when he said both things
[1:34:03] why didn't peter get the revelation but
[1:34:05] paul had to get to revelation 20 years
[1:34:06] later the holy ghost just dropped down
[1:34:08] and said hey that's what i was talking
[1:34:09] about when i was when i said eat my
[1:34:11] flesh and drink my blood all right so
[1:34:13] see how god works yes god works that way
[1:34:16] so don't don't be so don't get all bent
[1:34:19] out of shape if we don't quote it
[1:34:20] verbatim but now if it don't fit
[1:34:22] flat brother brown said god wrote
[1:34:24] between the lines
[1:34:25] the love letters between the lines but
[1:34:27] he said he's got to compare with above
[1:34:29] and below the line
[1:34:30] it can't be something different all
[1:34:32] right so let's go let's go get into that
[1:34:34] but still we
[1:34:35] we look we we're looking for things that
[1:34:37] and it's like brother brown said he said
[1:34:39] people are looking now just to refute
[1:34:40] what you're saying not to listen to try
[1:34:42] to learn
[1:34:43] why because it's a spirit of the age all
[1:34:45] right it's a spirit of iniquity and
[1:34:47] that's the way it is people it's
[1:34:48] iniquity
[1:34:49] there's no one to do better and not
[1:34:51] doing it
[1:34:52] so when a man lives by faith and walks
[1:34:54] by faith i mean substance faith he is
[1:34:57] isolated from the entire world and
[1:34:59] becomes a new creature in christ
[1:35:01] there now you're getting into bribe
[1:35:03] material right
[1:35:06] now you're getting into bright material
[1:35:08] see you're getting into rapturing
[1:35:10] condition now
[1:35:12] that means for each one of us not just
[1:35:14] the pastor deacon trustee that means for
[1:35:16] the lady every individual walks in a
[1:35:19] world with god alone
[1:35:21] amen
[1:35:22] he gives the orders you pack them out
[1:35:25] right
[1:35:26] you know brother brown said
[1:35:28] back up for a minute brother brian said
[1:35:30] you know he said let me walk into a
[1:35:31] guy's office
[1:35:32] let me walk into a guy in other words
[1:35:34] let me say this let me walk into a guy's
[1:35:36] home let me walk into your home you walk
[1:35:37] into my home open every closet open
[1:35:40] every door you're not gonna find
[1:35:41] anything any different
[1:35:42] um you know most of you especially the
[1:35:44] ones that are taking the class you know
[1:35:46] my life as well as i do because i told
[1:35:47] you all my finances i don't care
[1:35:49] anything to hide
[1:35:52] but are you showing god in everything
[1:35:54] you do
[1:35:56] every aspect of your life
[1:35:58] i know we slip up and we fail and we do
[1:36:00] things wrong
[1:36:02] but there are certain principle primer
[1:36:04] things brother brown said that we're
[1:36:05] supposed to be doing or god's not gonna
[1:36:07] deal with us
[1:36:09] we might be a child
[1:36:11] but remember brother brown said the holy
[1:36:12] ghost would go back to the father and
[1:36:13] said hey he's not acting like you
[1:36:16] that's right you know what god says
[1:36:18] he's my son
[1:36:20] but he's gonna stay out there in that
[1:36:21] field and work
[1:36:23] he's going to beat his head up against
[1:36:24] the wall and he's going to work and he's
[1:36:26] going to sweat
[1:36:27] until he realizes that i can give him
[1:36:30] more if he'll just act right and that's
[1:36:32] what god's doing just like children
[1:36:35] i want to give that eight-year-old boy
[1:36:37] an iphone
[1:36:39] because i would have expected the same
[1:36:41] results
[1:36:42] out of any eight-year-old
[1:36:45] i wanted to strangle that dude
[1:36:50] you what the parents you don't want the
[1:36:51] kids he didn't know where the kid was
[1:36:53] like five thousand dollars was mine that
[1:36:55] was mine that was my part
[1:36:59] bragging
[1:37:03] and that's the same way with god same
[1:37:06] way with god god gives us a blessing and
[1:37:08] then we just
[1:37:09] just mess it up so bad
[1:37:12] and he's like you're still a kid
[1:37:14] i can't give that to you again
[1:37:16] until you grow up and prove to me i'm
[1:37:19] not going to give that to you anymore
[1:37:21] i'm not giving you any more word until
[1:37:22] you can deal with the word that you
[1:37:23] already got
[1:37:25] all right so let's work on revelation
[1:37:27] and let it be something that anchors
[1:37:28] into our heart that's what i said about
[1:37:30] faith speaks you ought to be able to
[1:37:32] take what you believe and tell it to
[1:37:34] anybody in the world now whether they
[1:37:35] understand it or not but you ought to be
[1:37:37] able to explain the hope that's inside
[1:37:39] of you
[1:37:40] now you're coming into perfect faith
[1:37:41] perfect perfection that cannot fail
[1:37:44] that faith never fails yes he was a
[1:37:46] mystic to them with his perfect faith so
[1:37:49] is it now with those who have perfect
[1:37:52] faith are a mystic to others
[1:37:54] notice now another perfect faith is a
[1:37:56] master of all circumstances
[1:38:00] perfect faith masters all circumstances
[1:38:03] no matter what it is it masters it now
[1:38:05] watch
[1:38:06] when you believe anything do anything
[1:38:08] and you've got faith in what you're
[1:38:10] doing
[1:38:11] no matter what the circumstance is that
[1:38:13] don't have one thing to do with it see
[1:38:15] it masters that circumstance
[1:38:18] all right amen to that come on people we
[1:38:20] got to be able to wear you know and
[1:38:23] all right we're going to preach faith
[1:38:25] i'm going to get off each all folks but
[1:38:27] but you know other churches worship they
[1:38:30] worship god and and they don't have half
[1:38:32] the word we got right and some of you
[1:38:34] haven't raised your hands if you raise
[1:38:36] your hands
[1:38:37] you hear the bones popping
[1:38:41] amen
[1:38:45] maybe we're not as far as we
[1:38:48] should be
[1:38:52] they sit at a ball game like this at the
[1:38:54] georgia game
[1:38:57] i've never seen anybody unless they're
[1:38:59] dead
[1:39:00] except like that at a georgia game
[1:39:03] no what do they do they get there three
[1:39:04] hours early they got on all their stuff
[1:39:08] they ain't got a replica football
[1:39:10] so they can throw it back and forth
[1:39:12] with their other drunk friends
[1:39:15] a lot like brother ron said he said if
[1:39:18] you get drunk on the holy ghost one time
[1:39:19] you'll act like in people
[1:39:22] faith believes that god will work it
[1:39:24] out i don't know how he's going to do it
[1:39:26] but he'll do it anyway you know i don't
[1:39:28] know how my kids are coming
[1:39:31] i don't worry about that
[1:39:34] abraham 25 years later he was in worse
[1:39:38] shape physically than he was when the
[1:39:40] promise was made
[1:39:42] but he didn't look at the journey he
[1:39:44] looked at the promise
[1:39:46] forget the journey sure we got to go
[1:39:48] through the journey but forget the ups
[1:39:50] and downs and ins and outs and oh my god
[1:39:52] they're over here doing this and doing
[1:39:54] that i just believe i don't care if
[1:39:56] they're laying on their deathbed god's
[1:39:57] going to save them
[1:40:00] so there you go whatever circumstance
[1:40:02] does not make any difference right
[1:40:04] and faith and love is relation
[1:40:09] i like that
[1:40:11] because the bible says you can have
[1:40:13] faith
[1:40:15] you can have revelation
[1:40:17] but without love without charity
[1:40:19] it's nothing
[1:40:20] right right and faith and love is
[1:40:22] relation because you can't have faith
[1:40:26] unless you got love
[1:40:28] because your faith is in a god who is
[1:40:30] the very essence of love
[1:40:32] faith and love
[1:40:34] works together all right let's go to the
[1:40:35] next one
[1:40:37] number nine
[1:40:40] let's listen now watch perfect faith is
[1:40:42] pure just as pure as love is see now
[1:40:44] when you love somebody you love your
[1:40:46] husband or you love your wife now
[1:40:47] there's no need of anybody telling you
[1:40:49] you don't
[1:40:50] do it because you do and you know you do
[1:40:54] oh oh i prove it by the way i live to
[1:40:56] him see i'm a true honest wife i'm a
[1:40:58] loyal honest husband and that proves to
[1:41:00] me that i love my wife i love my husband
[1:41:02] see your life proves what you are
[1:41:07] the same thing christianity does see
[1:41:09] your faith
[1:41:10] you have confidence in one another is
[1:41:13] pure
[1:41:14] it's something real
[1:41:15] that you can't show it to somebody else
[1:41:18] yet you've got it
[1:41:19] and yet your actions prove it all right
[1:41:22] when satan tempts us we are to resist
[1:41:24] him in a perfect faith in a perfect word
[1:41:27] like jesus did the word of god is
[1:41:29] perfect we're to have perfect faith in
[1:41:31] this perfect word and resist satan
[1:41:34] by his faith in his word we he conquers
[1:41:37] we can conquer anything both death hell
[1:41:40] and the grave
[1:41:42] we know that god is god that perfect
[1:41:44] faith in god's perfect word he conquered
[1:41:46] everything that he come in contact with
[1:41:48] he never went to a funeral
[1:41:50] right he conquered death every time he
[1:41:53] never went to a funeral
[1:41:54] flowing from him was like rivers of
[1:41:57] virtue going out constantly bert you
[1:41:59] going from his garment
[1:42:02] and do the same thing then walk in the
[1:42:04] same kind of a way virtues flowing from
[1:42:07] you the rivers of god fountains of
[1:42:08] blessings that's flowing out of the
[1:42:10] people see what i mean and you're not
[1:42:12] blessing it you're not imagining it it's
[1:42:14] actually taking place and you see it
[1:42:18] when you see it you'll speak it that's
[1:42:20] right that's my quote not that one when
[1:42:22] you see it you'll speak it because you
[1:42:23] can't keep it that's right you can't
[1:42:25] keep it inside that's right who's the
[1:42:28] one that said it's like a fire shut up
[1:42:29] in my bones once you see something
[1:42:31] that's right you have to speak you have
[1:42:33] to say something and you're not bluffing
[1:42:35] it you're not imagining it's actually
[1:42:37] taking place and you see it if you're
[1:42:39] just imagining it that don't do any good
[1:42:41] but if it's really there it really
[1:42:43] happened right right he's really there
[1:42:46] it really happened all right
[1:42:47] now listen
[1:42:49] we're supposed to have let's go into a
[1:42:50] romans 10.
[1:42:56] then faith cometh
[1:42:58] by hearing
[1:43:00] so somebody's got to speak it right
[1:43:03] and hearing by the word of god but i say
[1:43:06] have they not heard
[1:43:09] yes barely their sound went into all the
[1:43:12] earth and their words
[1:43:14] unto the ends of the world
[1:43:16] faith comes by hearing
[1:43:18] and hearing comes by the word of god
[1:43:20] see if we're gonna have let's go to
[1:43:22] matthew 17 if you and i brother branham
[1:43:25] talks and
[1:43:25] to save time we're talking about now
[1:43:28] having a word revival the revival's over
[1:43:30] for healing
[1:43:32] healing revivals are over
[1:43:36] you understand what i'm saying sure they
[1:43:38] still have them but that's not what
[1:43:40] god's in god was in that at one time
[1:43:42] he's moved away
[1:43:48] healing campaigns
[1:43:50] are not god's program for the day
[1:43:53] let me put it that way his healing
[1:43:55] campaigns is not the program for the day
[1:43:57] we got to have them that was the
[1:43:59] foundation but that was back in that
[1:44:01] time where worldwide healing revival
[1:44:03] surely got things out there i'm talking
[1:44:05] about the bride
[1:44:07] the bride must now have a word revival
[1:44:09] where we feed on the word of god because
[1:44:12] there was a lot of people that was in
[1:44:14] those tents with brother branham and a.a
[1:44:15] al and all those people but remember
[1:44:17] when it comes down to when he started
[1:44:19] speaking the message
[1:44:22] the days of the voice when he started
[1:44:24] speaking the message that he was
[1:44:25] supposed to bring all that other stuff
[1:44:27] just went away
[1:44:29] right right
[1:44:30] that all just they left him in droves
[1:44:33] just like jesus remember when jesus said
[1:44:35] i and my father won
[1:44:37] what happened
[1:44:39] 70 left
[1:44:41] then this amount left then thousands
[1:44:43] left what he quit healing them he quit
[1:44:44] giving them bread he quit giving them
[1:44:46] social programs
[1:44:49] that's what it was
[1:44:50] but when he started preaching the word
[1:44:52] of god
[1:44:53] they said uh he's a vampire uh we don't
[1:44:56] wanna eat none of this and we don't need
[1:44:58] none of that or he's got a devil or they
[1:45:00] said the same thing to brother brown
[1:45:03] so same thing with you and i i i agree
[1:45:06] with brother dale when we get closer to
[1:45:08] the end time the bride's going to get
[1:45:10] what she needs to get out of here but
[1:45:11] there's going to be a revival out there
[1:45:14] but it's not going to be for the word
[1:45:15] they don't have a word revival right
[1:45:17] right the word's gone from them right
[1:45:19] they're done in 1956 brother brown said
[1:45:21] in the united states of america you're
[1:45:23] gone the word will never be preached you
[1:45:25] say well we've been preaching since then
[1:45:27] the true word of god has never been
[1:45:29] preached in the united states except
[1:45:30] what's in the bride
[1:45:32] i just believe that the true i'm talking
[1:45:35] about the 100
[1:45:37] and it's like the brother said the other
[1:45:39] day he said folks
[1:45:41] he said do you think god's going to let
[1:45:42] us get by when one word put us out of
[1:45:45] the garden
[1:45:46] you think he's gonna let us get by with
[1:45:48] one word and put us back in the garden
[1:45:50] no
[1:45:51] we gotta take that word that eve
[1:45:54] turned down we gotta have that plus
[1:45:56] everything else
[1:45:57] all right amen and jesus said unto them
[1:45:59] because of your unbelief
[1:46:02] for verily i say unto you if you have
[1:46:04] faith as a grain of mustard seed ye
[1:46:06] shall say unto this mountain
[1:46:08] remove hence to yonder place and it
[1:46:10] shall be it shall remove
[1:46:12] and nothing
[1:46:14] shall be impossible unto god
[1:46:20] my contacts must be bad
[1:46:22] oh it says you
[1:46:25] you that's right amen
[1:46:28] nothing shall be impossible
[1:46:30] unto you now let me give you the between
[1:46:33] the lines
[1:46:34] but if you don't do what i say and you
[1:46:36] don't believe
[1:46:38] and you don't believe in my word
[1:46:42] it's not impossible that's right amen i
[1:46:44] mean it is impossible
[1:46:46] everything's possible to those that
[1:46:48] believe right
[1:46:50] everything is possible to those that
[1:46:51] believe all right number 10.
[1:46:56] give you him let me say this if you
[1:46:58] count me a fanatic from this not on that
[1:47:01] very same thing that i'm speaking of
[1:47:03] will be done
[1:47:04] there'll be a power put into the church
[1:47:07] and now is coming in that the holy
[1:47:09] spirit will so anoint the people till
[1:47:11] they'll speak the word
[1:47:14] he's off the scene
[1:47:16] they will speak the word right
[1:47:18] they will speak the word and it will
[1:47:20] create itself glory right now
[1:47:24] we haven't seen powers like this and you
[1:47:26] think brother branham my lord millions
[1:47:29] of people healed raised the dead
[1:47:31] sick
[1:47:32] and he said it's coming
[1:47:34] he says it's coming
[1:47:37] we haven't seen powers like this coming
[1:47:39] this is 1960. coming into the church now
[1:47:42] i know it for a fact
[1:47:45] say unto this mountain be moved don't
[1:47:46] doubt in your heart but believe that
[1:47:48] what you've said shall come to pass you
[1:47:52] can have what you have said
[1:47:53] the placing of the church in position
[1:47:55] where the fullness
[1:47:57] of the power of the holy ghost comes
[1:47:59] into the church then critics mouths will
[1:48:01] be shut
[1:48:02] it'll be a short time
[1:48:04] jesus come right off the mountain and
[1:48:05] what's he talking about adoption
[1:48:07] jesus come right off the mountain and
[1:48:09] went straight to calvary notice it won't
[1:48:11] last long but it will be here
[1:48:15] and i say that was 50 something years
[1:48:18] ago it's here now all right
[1:48:21] it's here you can count me a fanatic if
[1:48:23] you want to but it's here now
[1:48:25] it's something that you and i need to
[1:48:27] possess
[1:48:28] the fullness of the power of the holy
[1:48:30] ghost but we're not going to do it by
[1:48:32] running up a 2 000 cell phone bill
[1:48:36] let me go back to my stories these
[1:48:37] things happen for a purpose
[1:48:40] i mean he's not going to give us a cell
[1:48:41] phone
[1:48:43] the
[1:48:44] word and then let us run up a two
[1:48:46] thousand dollar cell phone bill
[1:48:49] no he's
[1:48:51] he's a little bit uh different because
[1:48:52] he knew that was gonna happen that that
[1:48:55] parent didn't know but you know what the
[1:48:56] parents should have known being a parent
[1:48:58] he should have known the results right
[1:49:00] see god knows the results that you and i
[1:49:02] are going to do
[1:49:03] all right you and i don't know the
[1:49:05] results but you know what he's telling
[1:49:07] us how to walk he's telling us how to do
[1:49:09] the things that we do he's telling us to
[1:49:11] do what to do and what not to do he's
[1:49:12] telling us not a man all right let's go
[1:49:14] first corinthians let's go to matthew
[1:49:17] 10. and you shall be brought before
[1:49:18] governor you don't think this is going
[1:49:20] to happen look at the power that's going
[1:49:21] to be in the people
[1:49:23] you shall be brought before governors
[1:49:24] and kings for my sake for a testimony
[1:49:26] against them and the gentiles that's us
[1:49:29] but when they deliver you up take no
[1:49:31] thought
[1:49:33] you don't have to study for three hours
[1:49:36] because you're not gonna know what
[1:49:37] they're gonna ask you that's right
[1:49:39] but he said take no thought
[1:49:41] how
[1:49:43] or what
[1:49:46] how to speak it or what you're going to
[1:49:48] say that's right for it shall be given
[1:49:50] you in that same hour that you shall
[1:49:54] speak now look the reason we have to
[1:49:56] study
[1:49:57] is because we don't have it a lot of
[1:49:59] times in here
[1:50:02] right that's why we study because we
[1:50:04] don't have it that's right but there's
[1:50:05] going to be a time come somewhere that
[1:50:07] god's going to do something
[1:50:08] that we're not going to have to study
[1:50:10] for hours
[1:50:12] but you're going to have to have it
[1:50:14] in order to speak it that's right you're
[1:50:16] going to have to have it in you that's
[1:50:17] right you're going to have to have it
[1:50:18] packed in your brother colleen what
[1:50:19] brother's been telling you for 50 years
[1:50:21] you're going to have to have it packed
[1:50:22] inside of you that when you need it and
[1:50:24] he's not here
[1:50:26] that's right
[1:50:27] or i'm not here you can't find no
[1:50:29] brother
[1:50:30] combined with
[1:50:31] he said he didn't say you get together
[1:50:33] and ask for the man he said you say
[1:50:34] that's right
[1:50:35] you say
[1:50:37] because you know what he's going to
[1:50:38] depend on you
[1:50:40] to use his word right
[1:50:42] because he's watched you in action
[1:50:45] what did he say to brother brown he said
[1:50:47] because the way you chose
[1:50:49] a greater portion of heaven is waiting
[1:50:50] for you because of the way and it was
[1:50:52] the hard way that he chose but it's not
[1:50:54] ye that speak
[1:50:56] oh it's me that doesn't it's me me me me
[1:50:58] me i
[1:51:00] me me me me
[1:51:01] no
[1:51:03] that's too much
[1:51:06] let me see i got something i want to
[1:51:07] read you you know what dl moody said one
[1:51:09] time
[1:51:10] i wrote this on the back of a card
[1:51:12] because i saw it in a book
[1:51:14] theo moody said god sends no one away
[1:51:16] empty except for those that are full of
[1:51:19] themselves
[1:51:24] god sends no one away empty except for
[1:51:27] those that are full of themselves
[1:51:30] amen
[1:51:31] right
[1:51:32] we got to be sold out
[1:51:34] but it is not ye that speak but it is
[1:51:36] the spirit of your father which speaketh
[1:51:39] t.h ongoing speaketh
[1:51:42] in you all right let's go to the next
[1:51:43] one
[1:51:44] first corinthians 5 and 8 we are
[1:51:46] confident
[1:51:47] i say and willing rather to be absent
[1:51:50] from the body and to be present
[1:51:53] with the lord now that doesn't mean
[1:51:55] dying
[1:51:56] i want to be absent from this body
[1:52:00] you understand what i'm saying i want to
[1:52:01] be absent i'm not like paul i i don't
[1:52:03] want to be absent from the body i don't
[1:52:04] want to die but i want to be absent from
[1:52:06] this body
[1:52:07] and to be present
[1:52:09] with the lord
[1:52:10] see the problem with the people and i
[1:52:12] don't see a problem but the people that
[1:52:13] die and go on by the grave they go into
[1:52:16] the presence of the lord right that's
[1:52:18] right
[1:52:18] now those that are going to have their
[1:52:19] body changed that's going to have to
[1:52:21] reverse
[1:52:23] you're going to have to bring the
[1:52:24] presence of the lord here that's right
[1:52:26] in the same in the same real
[1:52:29] in the same real time and the same real
[1:52:31] person that you meet there when you go
[1:52:33] beyond the current time we got to bring
[1:52:35] him here
[1:52:38] right
[1:52:40] we got to catch up here not there
[1:52:43] if not we go there in his presence i
[1:52:45] want to be absolute from this body and
[1:52:47] present with god in this dimension
[1:52:49] all right not in another dimension all
[1:52:51] right let's go to number 11.
[1:52:54] and i'm going to read this is a long
[1:52:55] reading but now this was a this is
[1:52:57] something that i want everybody to
[1:52:59] really kind of wake yourself up and
[1:53:00] listen
[1:53:02] because brother brown had a vision
[1:53:05] and this vision was told in paradox and
[1:53:07] this will really help you because this
[1:53:09] is going to be we've been talking about
[1:53:11] faith coming up and having faith but
[1:53:13] brother brown is going to tell us
[1:53:15] what we need
[1:53:17] more than anything the angel of the lord
[1:53:19] told a prophet
[1:53:21] what's this and i heard the weeds
[1:53:22] mashing down and i looked and here come
[1:53:24] a huge monster snake crawling through
[1:53:26] the weeds
[1:53:27] now i thought now this is a vision that
[1:53:29] i'll see what this animal or this beast
[1:53:31] is and he crawled up on the highway and
[1:53:32] as soon as i got side of him i knew it
[1:53:34] was a mamba
[1:53:35] now bombay is an african snake which is
[1:53:37] the most deadly bite of all things there
[1:53:39] is there's nothing as poisonous as a
[1:53:41] mamba and the snake of course represents
[1:53:45] sin or death and death all right you got
[1:53:47] that that snake represents santa dead
[1:53:49] all right
[1:53:50] see and there's what we have in this
[1:53:51] country rattlesnake keep on going
[1:53:52] through there anyway a mamba they have
[1:53:55] all kind of cobras and but the mamba and
[1:53:57] you and if you know this as well as i do
[1:53:59] and i saw it on a movie one time or a
[1:54:02] video they come up on this big uh bull
[1:54:06] that had been bitten by a mamba in just
[1:54:08] a few seconds he was dead
[1:54:10] all right so same thing with with some
[1:54:12] of you that that you've seen snakes
[1:54:14] around here that mamba
[1:54:17] in anything he is he's death
[1:54:19] right right yeah 12 seconds is the
[1:54:21] longest you can live
[1:54:23] by being bit by a black mamba all right
[1:54:25] so keep going and then comes the mamba
[1:54:28] he's dead just when he's so fast you
[1:54:29] can't see him he goes over the top of
[1:54:31] the weeds and he propels itself with the
[1:54:33] back of his tail they don't bite you
[1:54:35] down here they strike up here
[1:54:37] appear close to the hearts that's why
[1:54:38] they killed you stands up high and
[1:54:39] strikes hard when he hits you he's just
[1:54:41] you just got a few breaths till you're
[1:54:43] finished now remember this is a parable
[1:54:46] with an underlying meaning all right
[1:54:48] because brother brown was given a vision
[1:54:50] now he's telling the vision to the
[1:54:51] people they said them native boys when
[1:54:53] you you holler mamba they'll butt their
[1:54:55] heads together scream because it's death
[1:54:57] in a few seconds when one hits you
[1:54:58] alright keep going
[1:54:59] and here he was on the highway and i
[1:55:01] thought well what is it so i looked at
[1:55:02] him and he looked angry at me and he
[1:55:04] licked his tongue and here he come but
[1:55:05] when he got real close to me he would
[1:55:07] run up fast and he would get slower and
[1:55:08] slower and just quiver and stop and then
[1:55:10] something would hold it
[1:55:12] he couldn't bite me and he'd turn around
[1:55:13] on the other side and try to approach
[1:55:15] from the other side and he'd get back
[1:55:17] and get a start and he switched right
[1:55:18] toward me get slower and slower and
[1:55:20] slower and then to a stop and then just
[1:55:22] shake like that and move back he
[1:55:23] couldn't strike me then he turned and
[1:55:25] looked at my friend and the way he went
[1:55:26] after my friend and i seen my friend
[1:55:28] just jumping up in the air over and over
[1:55:30] him and over him and over him trying and
[1:55:33] the thing was striking at him i thought
[1:55:34] oh if it ever hits him it's instant
[1:55:36] death no wonder everybody's so scared
[1:55:38] because when these things hit you it's
[1:55:40] an instant death
[1:55:42] all right and just then the serpent
[1:55:43] turned to me
[1:55:44] he said oh god have mercy on my brother
[1:55:47] when i said and just when the serpent
[1:55:49] turned to me when i said that and looked
[1:55:51] at me again and a voice came from above
[1:55:53] me and said you have been given power
[1:55:56] to bind him the worst or inning
[1:56:00] all right now mamba is like
[1:56:02] the apex and everything up under it is
[1:56:04] like second rate all right
[1:56:08] death is the
[1:56:10] greatest fear that man has
[1:56:12] cancer people survive cancer and all
[1:56:14] their heart attacks and all this stuff
[1:56:16] but when you say death that don't mean
[1:56:18] but one thing you about you've become
[1:56:20] absent from this body
[1:56:21] right and you're going to whatever
[1:56:24] place you're going to all right the
[1:56:26] voice came from above me said you have
[1:56:27] been given power to bind in the worst or
[1:56:29] any and i said well god what must i do
[1:56:31] and he said there's one thing you must
[1:56:33] do
[1:56:34] now he's telling a prophet
[1:56:38] he's telling a born-again
[1:56:41] prophet
[1:56:44] that he must be more sincere
[1:56:49] geez
[1:56:50] if he's got to be more sincere
[1:56:52] how about me and you
[1:56:54] there's one thing
[1:56:56] now look well god
[1:56:58] what must i do
[1:57:01] he said
[1:57:03] he's talking straight to the man
[1:57:06] or he's lying
[1:57:08] well god what must i do he said there's
[1:57:10] one thing you must do you must be more
[1:57:13] sincere
[1:57:14] excuse me you must be more sincere i
[1:57:16] said well god forgive me for my
[1:57:19] insincerity
[1:57:22] and let me have sincerity and when i
[1:57:24] raised up my hands to him again there
[1:57:26] was a great something came over me just
[1:57:29] lifted me up seemed like that my whole
[1:57:31] body was charged with something
[1:57:33] and i looked at the serpent and then he
[1:57:36] started toward me and he couldn't do it
[1:57:37] again and i said satan in the name of
[1:57:39] the lord jesus i bind you and and the
[1:57:41] serpent a blue smoke flew out of him
[1:57:44] now what is blue smoke
[1:57:48] it's kind of a putrid pale color right
[1:57:52] pale horse rider
[1:57:55] you got your riders in here i don't have
[1:57:56] time to get into it i've lost too much
[1:57:58] time a serpent a blue smoke flew out of
[1:58:01] him and he curled up and made a signal
[1:58:03] like an ass capital ass backwards
[1:58:08] now you see what the prophet said an and
[1:58:09] sign
[1:58:10] and that means buying this one or
[1:58:13] anything below him
[1:58:15] because he was the worst blue smoke fell
[1:58:18] out of him and his tail choked his own
[1:58:20] self to death around his head
[1:58:23] when he made this backwards ass that and
[1:58:25] sign like a conjunction you see choked
[1:58:27] it to death and the brother was free and
[1:58:29] i went over and mashed on it
[1:58:32] and he says you can buy unbind him also
[1:58:34] so i said then satan that i might know i
[1:58:36] unbind you
[1:58:38] and when it did he started coming to
[1:58:39] life again wiggle and said i bind you
[1:58:41] back in the name of jesus christ and
[1:58:42] when it did the smoke flew out of him
[1:58:44] again and he choked himself right back
[1:58:46] again and turned to crystal and then
[1:58:48] when he did that that boy said now you
[1:58:50] must be more sincere than what you are
[1:58:54] to do this
[1:58:56] then it left me
[1:58:58] i was standing in the room
[1:59:01] all the things that a prophet faced
[1:59:05] death
[1:59:06] you've got to be more sincere than what
[1:59:08] you are
[1:59:10] and i took the bible and just pulled it
[1:59:11] open to my thumb was laying at first
[1:59:13] corinthians the fifth chapter and the
[1:59:14] eighth verse
[1:59:18] when something reads something like this
[1:59:21] when you come i was planning on taking
[1:59:22] the fast to the lord i told him i'd go
[1:59:24] out and fast said when you come to this
[1:59:25] beast which are fast in the body is a
[1:59:28] feast with the lord we know that so when
[1:59:30] you come to this feast don't come with
[1:59:32] the old leaven
[1:59:34] is that right don't come with the old
[1:59:36] leaven
[1:59:36] or the leaven of malice and so forth but
[1:59:38] come with the unleavened bread of
[1:59:40] sincerity and truth just exactly what he
[1:59:42] told me in the vision come god is my
[1:59:44] solemn judge come with the unleavened
[1:59:46] bread now what is leaven
[1:59:48] leaven is sin
[1:59:50] right but he said come with unleavened
[1:59:52] bread of sincerity and truth that is the
[1:59:54] word
[1:59:55] then i sing
[1:59:57] what he meant all right let's look at
[1:59:58] the last
[2:00:01] experiences 1947
[2:00:03] i don't believe you can get too sincere
[2:00:05] about the work of god that's right
[2:00:08] more sincere you are
[2:00:10] the better god can lead you
[2:00:13] that's where we're failing if we're
[2:00:15] going to destroy death
[2:00:17] we've got to become more sincere
[2:00:20] that's what he said
[2:00:21] 27 division to destroy death you and i
[2:00:23] are going to become
[2:00:25] more
[2:00:26] sincere
[2:00:27] now here's my last statement the words
[2:00:31] have been stuck on the page for a long
[2:00:33] time
[2:00:36] and it's just been
[2:00:38] us reciting
[2:00:42] right
[2:00:42] repetition
[2:00:44] we just say this and we say that but
[2:00:47] when that word
[2:00:48] we become so sincere that that word
[2:00:51] and us become one and you can't tell the
[2:00:53] difference in the two right
[2:00:55] that's when we're gonna be able to
[2:00:56] behind things that's when we're gonna be
[2:00:58] able to bind death and bind the things
[2:01:00] that we have to uh
[2:01:02] you know what you
[2:01:03] start with your home
[2:01:05] just your glenn brother joe it's brother
[2:01:07] anderson and them they they
[2:01:10] go to your home
[2:01:12] clean out all the trash
[2:01:14] and start over
[2:01:16] you show i'm scared then you're an
[2:01:17] unbeliever
[2:01:19] have faith in god forget about what the
[2:01:22] other people say have faith in god amen
[2:01:25] i have to have faith in god i don't let
[2:01:26] my daughter do things in my house you
[2:01:28] know why because i have faith in god
[2:01:30] that if i allow her to come in and do
[2:01:31] them and i allow her to do it then i
[2:01:33] have partaken of her sin
[2:01:35] and god's not going to bless them that's
[2:01:37] right
[2:01:38] i want people to come to my home
[2:01:40] and relax
[2:01:42] and and be able to be at home and to be
[2:01:44] able to feel like they're home well
[2:01:46] they're not going to do that with all
[2:01:47] the racket going off and this going off
[2:01:48] and all these kind of things going on
[2:01:50] start with your home and then start with
[2:01:52] yourself
[2:01:54] start with your job
[2:01:56] go and tell the people and confess that
[2:01:57] i'm a christian
[2:01:59] i've done things wrong in the past and i
[2:02:01] may not look like one but today i'm a
[2:02:03] christian
[2:02:04] and from this day forward you're going
[2:02:05] to see a difference
[2:02:07] because if i act the same as i've always
[2:02:08] acted
[2:02:11] god can't use you
[2:02:13] i want god to use us
[2:02:14] i want these hands to be god's hands
[2:02:16] they were the devil's hands long enough
[2:02:19] i want these feet to be god's feet this
[2:02:20] mouth to be god's mouth
[2:02:23] i want that that's my desire
[2:02:26] so to do that i've got to become more
[2:02:28] sincere
[2:02:30] you may not have the responsibility that
[2:02:32] i have oh everybody wants to be a
[2:02:34] preacher they want to do this no you
[2:02:35] know what we got souls hanging on the
[2:02:36] line here
[2:02:39] we've got your soul
[2:02:41] hanging on the line
[2:02:43] that's just like me and daddy were
[2:02:44] discussing the other day
[2:02:46] if those preachers
[2:02:48] don't get that daniel 70 weeks right
[2:02:50] we're not saying we're right we're just
[2:02:51] saying that we can put the message with
[2:02:53] the bible and with the prophet's quote
[2:02:55] that's enough for me that's right that's
[2:02:58] god speaking in all three places and
[2:03:00] when god speaks that's what
[2:03:02] when faith speaks you've got to worry
[2:03:03] about what people come
[2:03:05] you don't worry about what people say
[2:03:07] i don't worry what people got to say
[2:03:09] because there are certain things in the
[2:03:11] bible that you can stand on but if they
[2:03:13] get it wrong
[2:03:15] then their whole congregation's wrong
[2:03:17] that's right
[2:03:18] that's right if they preach a trinity
[2:03:21] everybody in that church that accepts
[2:03:23] that
[2:03:24] will never get past that
[2:03:27] unless somebody does get a revelation
[2:03:29] somewhere else or hear something else
[2:03:31] and move
[2:03:33] or whatever but if you stay there and
[2:03:34] accept that you accept that doctrine
[2:03:37] that's right if you accept that doctrine
[2:03:39] you can't have perfect faith in error
[2:03:42] oh you can believe yeah some of you
[2:03:45] believed where you were
[2:03:47] right
[2:03:48] but when you heard the word of truth
[2:03:52] you come to that
[2:03:54] that's the drawing part but when you do
[2:03:56] that you don't go you don't just sit
[2:03:58] down in a pew and just
[2:04:07] no you want to tell it
[2:04:09] right that's right
[2:04:11] you want to speak
[2:04:13] you want that thing to come up inside of
[2:04:15] you
[2:04:16] and
[2:04:16] and be a part of you so much
[2:04:22] that when you speak
[2:04:24] the devil has to listen
[2:04:27] and it's not you speaking
[2:04:29] it's god speaking through you but you
[2:04:30] know why he's speaking through you
[2:04:31] because he can trust that vessel that
[2:04:33] he's speaking through
[2:04:34] he's got trust
[2:04:36] we're not babies anymore we're not
[2:04:38] drinking milk anymore sure i like a
[2:04:40] little bit of milk every once in a while
[2:04:41] but i like a big old steak
[2:04:43] i like a great big one i do not go to
[2:04:46] murphy's in in in oklahoma and sit down
[2:04:48] and drink a
[2:04:50] cup of milk for those of you that's been
[2:04:53] there you know we eat that big old steak
[2:04:56] now one may want some milk but you know
[2:04:58] why
[2:04:59] i've had an experience
[2:05:01] i've eat that before
[2:05:03] and it was good
[2:05:04] so i want some more of it amen in the
[2:05:07] gospel the same way i've eat from that
[2:05:09] right i've eaten slop before
[2:05:12] i've eat chopstick before
[2:05:14] but this steak is good
[2:05:17] and i come to the place where it's good
[2:05:20] i come to the place where the steak is
[2:05:21] good
[2:05:22] and the steak is good
[2:05:24] let's stand
[2:05:27] but faith must speak faith cannot be
[2:05:31] silent
[2:05:33] faith must grow
[2:05:36] you know what unless you're unless
[2:05:37] you're kind of odd
[2:05:40] you didn't when you were a baby you
[2:05:41] didn't have hair on your chest
[2:05:43] you had to grow something
[2:05:46] because you got what older
[2:05:51] get hair on your chest
[2:05:55] because you grew up right
[2:05:57] you've done things you were supposed to
[2:05:58] do you became an adult
[2:06:01] when i was a child i spoke to the child
[2:06:02] paul said but when i become a man i put
[2:06:06] away childish things
[2:06:08] the pampers wasn't in the closet anymore
[2:06:12] i didn't have to eat
[2:06:15] i didn't have to eat baby food
[2:06:18] because the desire in my heart was to
[2:06:20] grow the desire in my body was to have
[2:06:22] something that was better
[2:06:24] something that was better for me same
[2:06:26] way with the word of god people we're
[2:06:28] going to have to take this word
[2:06:30] and we're going to have to apply it to
[2:06:31] our everyday life
[2:06:33] and we're going to have to apply it to
[2:06:34] our spiritual life because we cannot
[2:06:36] just sit around and say we're in the
[2:06:39] message
[2:06:41] and we've got the word
[2:06:43] and something don't develop out of that
[2:06:45] something must develop we must be able
[2:06:47] to speak
[2:06:51] and go forward
[2:06:53] speak the word
[2:06:56] joshua
[2:06:58] told him to walk seven times
[2:07:01] and he said you speak
[2:07:03] right so whatever you say
[2:07:06] that wall is gonna come down amen and to
[2:07:08] walk him down right we got walls that we
[2:07:11] that we're dealing with
[2:07:12] walls that are called sickness and walls
[2:07:14] that are called things that we're that
[2:07:16] we do wrong and things that we that we
[2:07:19] are that we're struggling with but you
[2:07:20] know what
[2:07:23] those people believe joshua so much
[2:07:25] until they did what he said
[2:07:28] he didn't tell him to sharpen their
[2:07:29] swords he didn't he just said go walk
[2:07:31] around walk around the city
[2:07:33] walk around it
[2:07:34] seven times
[2:07:36] and then when you get to the seventh
[2:07:37] time just stop and blow the trumpet and
[2:07:39] shout
[2:07:40] now he didn't tell him that they needed
[2:07:42] a bulldozer and they needed it he just
[2:07:44] said go shop
[2:07:45] speak
[2:07:47] speak it
[2:07:48] from now on people i want us to speak
[2:07:50] this thing
[2:07:51] speaking and go forward you say well i
[2:07:52] might speak it wrong where are you mine
[2:07:55] but if something comes down from the
[2:07:56] inside
[2:07:57] i'll guarantee you
[2:07:59] it'll come to pass
[2:08:01] because as human beings
[2:08:04] we don't like change
[2:08:06] and you know what we don't like a lot of
[2:08:08] things that we have to do
[2:08:09] but you know what if it's god doing it
[2:08:11] there's where the rightness
[2:08:13] or the righteousness of god we have no
[2:08:16] rightness in ourselves
[2:08:18] so we have to have his righteousness we
[2:08:21] have to be eroded with his righteousness
[2:08:22] once we're rolled with his righteousness
[2:08:24] we'll do the right thing let's take a
[2:08:26] song
[2:08:28] ain't god good
[2:08:30] ain't god good to give us so many
[2:08:32] blessings
[2:08:33] undeserving y'all pray for us this week
[2:08:35] we got uh
[2:08:36] we got this weekend coming up and we
[2:08:38] want to
[2:08:39] really uh
[2:08:40] uh you know lay it out there like that
[2:08:42] said we
[2:08:43] even some of the preachers um
[2:08:47] admitted that it'd been 25 years since
[2:08:49] they've picked up a 10-70 week's book
[2:08:52] 25 years
[2:08:54] 25 years
[2:08:56] you know why
[2:08:57] i'll say it and i don't care if they
[2:08:58] hear it they're scared of it
[2:09:01] because they don't understand it right
[2:09:03] something you understand
[2:09:06] you keep with you the whole time
[2:09:08] something i understand i keep with me
[2:09:10] because it's a part of me brother gary
[2:09:12] but if i don't understand it what i do
[2:09:13] brother dick well i don't understand
[2:09:14] that well i don't understand that well i
[2:09:17] don't understand that that i don't
[2:09:19] understand
[2:09:20] hey
[2:09:22] we better start understanding something
[2:09:25] because it's the total plan of
[2:09:26] redemption
[2:09:27] that's what we're looking at because i
[2:09:29] want this thing changed
[2:09:31] we got redemption
[2:09:32] i want the total plan of redemption
[2:09:33] which changes its body right here
[2:09:36] all right this thing ain't got good
[2:09:59] oh
[2:10:26] yesterday thinking about blessings
[2:10:28] that god has given me just in my life
[2:10:58] uh
[2:11:11] um
[2:12:13] uh
[2:12:22] oh
[2:12:45] i'm
[2:12:51] um
[2:13:03] one more time

[2:14:44] and god will honor you amen
[2:14:47] amen give god the glory
[2:14:49] when you're down in the valley
[2:14:51] and he'll put you on a mountain all
[2:14:53] right but when you're on a mountain
[2:14:55] don't forget where you came from down in
[2:14:56] the valley
[2:14:58] don't forget that part
[2:15:00] because that's the part we stay down
[2:15:01] here you know it takes usually it takes
[2:15:03] two valleys to make one mountain
[2:15:05] you gotta have two valleys to make a
[2:15:06] mountain so you're going to be in the
[2:15:08] valley twice as you're on top of the
[2:15:09] mountain
[2:15:10] but you know what when you're on the
[2:15:11] mountain boy doesn't it feel good
[2:15:24] right
[2:15:38] um
[2:16:03] foreign
[2:16:32] is
[2:16:57] is
[2:17:26] to come to a position
[2:17:28] come up out of this
[2:17:30] come out of her my people
[2:17:32] my people
[2:17:35] come out of her
[2:17:37] what that old church organization that
[2:17:39] you got
[2:17:40] he said
[2:17:48] listen folks
[2:17:50] speaking for your children
[2:17:53] speak it for your family
[2:17:55] speaking for your husband for your life
[2:17:57] oh there so far
[2:18:00] so were you
[2:18:03] so were you
[2:18:05] too far that man couldn't get you
[2:18:08] but not too far that god can't get you
[2:18:11] you didn't go too far that god couldn't
[2:18:13] go find you somewhere
[2:18:15] how dare us say he's too far gone she's
[2:18:18] too far gone
[2:18:20] no as long as there's a desire in your
[2:18:21] heart
[2:18:23] there's a connection somewhere
[2:18:25] with your brother with your sisters with
[2:18:27] your family
[2:18:29] when you're with your husband and your
[2:18:30] wife there's a connection there
[2:18:32] somewhere
[2:18:34] there's only one thing folks that'll
[2:18:36] stop
[2:18:40] and that desire will stop you
[2:18:44] from desiring that they come because
[2:18:46] there's no way they can god can't do
[2:18:48] anything i miss but as long as you've
[2:18:50] got a desire for anybody
[2:18:52] all they they've been mad 14 times
[2:18:54] they've done this they've said it they
[2:18:56] said we hate the message they said we
[2:18:58] hate god
[2:18:59] that's just that just learns
[2:19:02] that's just words of a human
[2:19:05] the words of god says
[2:19:08] believe
[2:19:10] jailor what do you want
[2:19:13] i don't want just me saved
[2:19:15] i want my whole household thing
[2:19:19] now a jailer
[2:19:21] a jailer
[2:19:22] had a desire
[2:19:25] because they were going to kill him
[2:19:27] paul said no hold on we're still here
[2:19:30] we're still here we didn't run off
[2:19:33] the jail said all that my me and my
[2:19:35] household be saved
[2:19:37] and i believe the bible said
[2:19:40] that it happened
[2:19:42] because they believed
[2:19:44] he believed for his whole family
[2:19:46] i don't think we've got desperate enough
[2:19:48] or sincere enough
[2:19:51] let's have more sincerity
[2:19:53] get rid of the unleavened bread
[2:19:57] let me get like the lemon bread and
[2:19:59] let's bring the 11 bread in
[2:20:01] all that is is bread and water that's
[2:20:03] just flour and water that's it
[2:20:07] so let's be watched by the word of the
[2:20:09] word
[2:20:10] believe for your family
[2:20:13] this is the hour that god can give to us
[2:20:17] and we'll just believe
[2:20:20] faith speaks
[2:20:22] faith will come out
[2:20:24] and it will not
[2:20:26] if you think god's gonna say something
[2:20:27] wrong
[2:20:29] yeah you might say something wrong but
[2:20:30] god's never going to say anything wrong
[2:20:32] so if you take this word
[2:20:35] and you say what's in here brother brown
[2:20:37] said he's got to back it up
[2:20:40] he's got to back it up
[2:20:41] and it comes from right here
[2:20:44] but if it comes from here it's your head
[2:20:46] knowledge
[2:20:48] but let's get all of our trash cleaned
[2:20:50] out so we can come boldly through the
[2:20:52] throne of grace and we can come up and
[2:20:54] ask that high priest to forgive us
[2:20:57] to forgive our whole household
[2:21:00] what did job do
[2:21:02] first thing job done when trouble
[2:21:03] started he started making sacrifices not
[2:21:05] for only him but it's for his whole
[2:21:07] family
[2:21:09] god if they've done something wrong
[2:21:11] we can't control their lives out there
[2:21:13] but we sure can pray that god will stir
[2:21:15] their water so bad
[2:21:18] don't even let them sleep at night
[2:21:20] until they come to this world
[2:21:23] and i'm not somebody just come to church
[2:21:26] i'm not going to come to work
[2:21:28] but they'll be in it and they'll be a
[2:21:29] part
[2:21:48] is
[2:22:11] you believe god yeah how many of you
[2:22:13] gonna be more sincere
[2:22:16] more sincere
[2:22:18] god's all in your hand
[2:22:20] if you're not he'll tell you that
[2:22:22] but if your more sins want to be more
[2:22:24] sincere
[2:22:25] then you know what god has to start
[2:22:27] working on that
[2:22:29] because you've spoken
[2:22:32] what you say
[2:22:33] to this mountain yes it's going to make
[2:22:36] a difference amen
[2:22:38] what you say
[2:22:40] not what the pastor says
[2:22:42] but what you say
[2:22:43] i have a mountain that may be different
[2:22:45] from your mountain right
[2:22:47] i need a mountain move for me
[2:22:49] but it may not be the same mountain that
[2:22:51] you won't move
[2:22:54] but if you have a mountain today
[2:22:56] you just believe
[2:22:58] you just believe
[2:22:59] forget everything else
[2:23:01] are we supposed to look at circumstances
[2:23:04] if jesus looked at circumstances he'd
[2:23:06] have never died
[2:23:08] he never looked at the circumstance he
[2:23:10] had a job to do
[2:23:13] i must die
[2:23:15] for the sins of the world
[2:23:16] that's what he was supposed to do and
[2:23:18] that's what he did he went to the cross
[2:23:21] he was done
[2:23:22] and now he's come back into believers
[2:23:24] now it's not just one jesus million
[2:23:26] jesus is now
[2:23:28] millions of standing here
[2:23:30] with the same listen to me
[2:23:33] the same words he had
[2:23:35] he said my words are spirit
[2:23:38] and their life
[2:23:40] if you believe god spoke to you today
[2:23:42] then i say unto you these words are
[2:23:44] spirit amen in their life
