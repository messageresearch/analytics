[6:14] 28
[6:17] we all know and we know that all things
[6:20] work together for good to them that love
[6:21] God to them who are decalled according
[6:24] to his purpose
[6:25] for whom he did for no he also did
[6:28] predestinate
[6:29] to be conformed to the image of his son
[6:32] that he might be the firstborn among
[6:33] many Brethren moreover whom he did
[6:36] predestinate then he also called and
[6:38] whom he called them he also Justified
[6:41] in whom he justified them he also
[6:44] glorified what shall we
[6:46] then say to these things what could we
[6:49] say to all that amen right if God be for
[6:53] us who can be against us now drop over
[6:55] to verse 14
[6:58] the 8th chapter and we'll read just a
[7:00] couple of three verses therefore
[7:04] for as many as are led by the spirit of
[7:07] God they are the sons of God
[7:10] for ye have not received the spirit of
[7:12] bondage again to fear but you have
[7:13] received the spirit of adoption whereby
[7:15] we cry our thy father and the spirit it
[7:19] says breath witness with our spirit that
[7:21] we are the children of God
[7:23] and if children now look at it
[7:26] then what is what does we turn out to be
[7:28] if we're children
[7:30] and if children
[7:32] then heirs that's who we are Heirs of
[7:35] what Heirs of God
[7:38] and Joint heirs with Christ if pro-be
[7:41] that we suffer with him that we may be
[7:43] also glorified together
[7:45] for I reckon that the suffering at this
[7:47] present time we're not worthy to be
[7:49] compared with the glory which shall be
[7:51] revealed in US you may be seated the
[7:53] Lord had his Blessing to the reading of
[7:56] the word
[8:02] now we're going to set in things because
[8:04] we're going to put Wade as to be in the
[8:07] Sunday School Superintendent because
[8:09] sometimes people leave and and they
[8:12] don't give don't get nobody to do your
[8:14] job so we're going to set it to a person
[8:17] now that we're you know always said you
[8:19] contact somebody to take your position
[8:21] your your class that day you know but
[8:25] then when it winds up and we get here
[8:26] and nobody don't know who's supposed to
[8:28] be in charge of that class then we you
[8:31] know we have trouble so you know contact
[8:34] somebody
[8:35] and make sure that they will take your
[8:38] class and do it and then contact Wade to
[8:41] make sure you know that everything's
[8:42] doing it when you're going to be missing
[8:44] because you know it's we need to get
[8:47] somebody in in those classes to cover
[8:50] that and we we certainly appreciate all
[8:52] of the ones who teach your classes and
[8:54] things but we want it to be in order too
[8:57] to where that we'll know everything
[8:59] being taken care of instead of coming up
[9:01] and nobody for that class that day so
[9:03] make sure you cover that
[9:05] and cover it with weight because he will
[9:07] be the Sunday School Superintendent to
[9:10] take care of that in all the things all
[9:12] right
[9:14] now
[9:15] we've been speaking for
[9:18] some time now
[9:20] about how does God
[9:23] predestinate
[9:25] how does God predestinate
[9:28] all right we found that
[9:31] he predestinates
[9:33] by his foreknowledge
[9:36] all right and by predestinating by his
[9:40] foreknowledge that's the way the prophet
[9:42] explains it then it does away with all
[9:46] of the thoughts and ideas of mankind
[9:49] of organized religion and then the ones
[9:52] in the message who who have all of these
[9:55] predetermined situations
[9:57] because you know I I I've got a quote
[10:01] where brother or brother random said it
[10:03] you know he said I'm not doing this to
[10:04] to start a doctor and I'm doing this to
[10:07] straighten it out we'll read that in a
[10:08] little while in the message but we found
[10:11] out then that what is the prophet of God
[10:14] say
[10:15] he says predestination
[10:19] looks back to foreknowledge
[10:22] so why would you want predestinate why
[10:24] would you want to predestinate something
[10:26] why would you want to have a
[10:27] consideration of something being
[10:29] predetermined which is what
[10:31] predestination means it means a destiny
[10:34] set beforehand
[10:36] well see God sets his Destiny by his
[10:38] foreknowledge
[10:39] and that way he's not a respecter of
[10:41] persons
[10:43] he knows what we will do he knew what
[10:45] Jacob would do he knew what Esau would
[10:48] do so he could go ahead and say Jacob I
[10:51] love and he saw I hate even before they
[10:53] were born
[10:55] because he's the infinite God
[10:57] all right and see then that way he
[11:00] predestinates he said it five times and
[11:03] the message there of that predestination
[11:07] looks back to foreknowledge
[11:10] then foreknowledge comes back see and
[11:13] then you're looking back the other way
[11:14] and you can see what is
[11:18] Destiny or time
[11:20] and as I've asked you did God set back
[11:23] before the world and think about what
[11:26] we're doing today or is this what we're
[11:28] doing
[11:30] see which one is it which would be the
[11:32] greater
[11:33] you mean you're going to put God to put
[11:35] him back there somewhere why not let him
[11:37] be what he is he's infinite
[11:39] all right see then if he predestinates
[11:42] by his foreknowledge then he's not
[11:45] putting you as the prophet said in a
[11:46] pipe and pushing you through the other
[11:48] end and calling it predestination
[11:53] see if we'd ever thought of that and
[11:55] didn't organize religion you wouldn't
[11:57] have had to split in a Baptist Church
[11:58] split over predestination uh way back
[12:01] 100 years ago or so and uh
[12:04] if you hadn't had that see you know the
[12:06] thoughts and here comes the
[12:08] Presbyterians they came in with the
[12:10] predestination thoughts but everybody's
[12:12] running it into predetermining or said a
[12:15] thing you know that's where it's going
[12:17] to be
[12:18] so if I could be saved I'll be saved if
[12:21] not I won't
[12:22] and there was an old Doctrine back there
[12:24] in the the independent kind of form of
[12:27] of Baptists that even had a doctrine
[12:30] that they didn't want to take their kids
[12:32] to the to a Revival because it might get
[12:34] saved and God wouldn't want them to be
[12:38] and you say well that's great that's a
[12:40] Doctrine that's not my idea you just
[12:43] check it out
[12:44] all right so you find out all these
[12:46] doctrines come down through time and
[12:49] come out into the message of the hour of
[12:52] the people and their doings but yet we
[12:55] see that God
[12:58] he doesn't predestinate by his desires
[13:03] because he desired everybody to be saved
[13:07] if he predestinated by his desire see
[13:10] he'd pick this one he picked this one
[13:11] he'd pick that one he picked that one
[13:13] that would be but he really he
[13:15] predestinates by your desire amen
[13:20] he before the world could write your
[13:22] name in the land's Book of Life or leave
[13:25] it out because of knowing what you would
[13:27] do or I would do when we got here
[13:30] all right so then he's not
[13:33] stamping it we're the ones that stamping
[13:35] it we're the ones that are are making
[13:37] our own predestination we're living our
[13:40] own predestination
[13:42] as to what we do and and the way we live
[13:45] all right see then going back then into
[13:48] the to the the thoughts of what we've
[13:51] been on about the mind of God
[13:53] and see everybody said if I was in the
[13:56] mind of God I I I'm I'm all right
[13:59] well Judas is Garrett was in the mind of
[14:01] God
[14:04] come on his name was written in the Book
[14:06] of Life
[14:08] right not the loud book of life now
[14:13] see his name was written in heaven he
[14:15] remember his disciples sitting there and
[14:16] Jesus said to Rejoice not at the devil's
[14:19] are subject but Rejoice because your
[14:20] names are written in heaven and judas's
[14:22] name was written in heaven
[14:24] but taken out when he
[14:27] rejected Jesus Christ
[14:29] all right
[14:30] so then why would we want to get into a
[14:33] problem of saying or a thought that we
[14:36] would be saying
[14:38] well if I was just in his mind
[14:41] when everybody was in his mind
[14:45] by foreknowledge everybody would ever
[14:48] come into the world was in the mind of
[14:49] God
[14:52] now then what would it be
[14:55] see there's a great difference I tried
[14:58] to get this point across there the other
[15:00] day
[15:01] and I want you to see it there's a great
[15:03] difference in being in the mind or the
[15:06] thinking of God
[15:09] and actually being a part of that God
[15:12] that does the thinking
[15:14] there's a vast difference in it
[15:17] because he could think of everybody in
[15:18] the world and
[15:20] you know the biggest portion of the
[15:22] people of the world are going to die and
[15:23] go to hell one day right
[15:25] because of their choosing not because of
[15:28] what he made them be but by their
[15:30] choosing well he could go ahead and set
[15:33] that and that could be in his thinking
[15:39] all right
[15:40] but yet I'd rather be a part that's what
[15:42] I've always tried to tell you for 40
[15:44] years now
[15:46] I'd rather be a part of the one that's
[15:48] doing the thinking
[15:51] if I'm a part of the one doing the
[15:53] thinking there's a vast difference
[15:55] between
[15:57] is the thoughts as I said the other day
[15:59] you have thoughts right
[16:03] or all your thoughts part of you
[16:06] or does Satan give you thoughts
[16:11] go on
[16:13] there's a lot of thoughts I get I don't
[16:15] want to be a part of me
[16:17] I have to repent of it I repent for
[16:20] thinking it
[16:21] right do you right
[16:23] well that's not part of me
[16:27] if it was I'd go on with it
[16:30] but it's not part of me but what about
[16:32] an infinite God
[16:36] that the prophet said he cannot have
[16:42] one thought and then have another
[16:45] he said cause his thoughts eternal
[16:50] so then you're servant and eternal God
[16:52] that would know every Nat never flee and
[16:54] whatever it be in the world
[16:58] that's infinite
[17:00] see we're not playing anything over on
[17:02] him by trying to be so smart ethically
[17:04] about what we think intellectually or or
[17:08] uh you know in understanding of
[17:11] scriptures or whatever
[17:13] we should sit down and just say thank
[17:15] you Lord
[17:17] for allowing me to see the truth
[17:19] all right
[17:21] and just forget it
[17:23] and say I don't understand all of it
[17:25] but I certainly believe it
[17:28] all right
[17:29] see because I believe that God before
[17:31] the world
[17:35] according to the scriptures according to
[17:37] the prophet
[17:39] he foreknew everything
[17:42] that would ever transpire
[17:46] if he didn't he's not God that's a
[17:48] simple point
[17:49] but knowing everything then he could go
[17:52] ahead and write the
[17:55] your name in heaven or leave it out
[17:57] because of what you right you desire
[18:01] to me that's simple
[18:06] and and see it doesn't give you eternal
[18:08] life
[18:11] try to read my own notes and sometimes I
[18:13] Mark two of them can't even read them
[18:14] but
[18:15] see it does not give us eternal life
[18:18] to be in his thinking
[18:22] right
[18:23] are you listening it doesn't give you
[18:25] eternal life to be in the thinking of
[18:26] God because Judas was in his thinking
[18:31] so was Adolf Hitler whatever you want to
[18:33] go or who would you want to put there
[18:36] but if we're a part of the one who done
[18:39] the thinking
[18:42] then we have eternal life
[18:48] so the main thing is to see in whether
[18:50] or not
[18:51] we have eternal life
[18:56] not to try to figure out what I was
[18:57] before the world
[19:00] because the prophet says we want nothing
[19:02] we was only in his thinking
[19:07] see we want to get into all of those
[19:08] little doctrinal ideas and bring in a
[19:11] Mormon doctrine of pre-existence
[19:15] and have everybody up in heaven
[19:18] that's people
[19:20] the prophet said we wasn't there
[19:24] see that's the main thing that I've
[19:26] tried to get you to look at in the past
[19:28] few messages
[19:32] is to be able to look back
[19:34] and see God and how great he could be
[19:38] but yet us not being there as people
[19:43] I don't believe that we were
[19:45] up in heaven as people
[19:49] that's pre-existence
[19:55] I believe that you and I were in God's
[19:57] thinking amen
[19:59] of what we would be when we got here
[20:02] all right
[20:04] now in doing that sure then he could see
[20:07] who would accept him
[20:11] and who would not
[20:15] if we just go back to that simple point
[20:17] of him in his mind
[20:21] and look at it as the point of
[20:24] saying
[20:26] it's not that I just want to be in God's
[20:28] mind
[20:31] I want to be a child of God
[20:35] I want to be his offspring
[20:40] see then we know that that way we didn't
[20:43] come into the world with eternal life
[20:47] he said well I've got a quote well okay
[20:49] we got a lot of message too so
[20:52] we're not fighting quotes
[20:55] we're talking about understanding
[21:00] in a simple point to me is very simple
[21:07] if we come into the world with eternal
[21:09] life
[21:10] then Jesus Christ never had to die
[21:14] so we're going to have to back up our
[21:17] predestination
[21:19] you know we're already here we know that
[21:21] they would have to back it up and we
[21:23] would get out to get down there with
[21:26] Nicodemus
[21:28] Nicodemus had a pretty good
[21:30] understanding
[21:33] and what we'd be saying is Nicodemus you
[21:35] don't need a new birth
[21:37] you need to you just need to get your
[21:39] thinking straightened out
[21:41] you need to realize you always was that
[21:44] was his Doctrine
[21:48] that was the doctrine of the Pharisees
[21:50] and Sadducees
[21:52] that they were the children of God
[21:57] they laid on circumcision as to cleanse
[22:00] in the flesh
[22:01] and their belief was that they had
[22:03] eternal life
[22:08] eternal life was not a a new doctrine
[22:11] when Jesus began to speak of it
[22:16] because see they believed they were
[22:18] Eternal children of God
[22:25] but now if Jesus Christ
[22:28] didn't die we can't have eternal life
[22:34] because there's no way to impart it
[22:37] I know I've tried for 40 something years
[22:39] to get to people the message to see the
[22:41] one thing nobody had
[22:44] eternal life
[22:45] as a possession
[22:48] a new birth whatever until Jesus Christ
[22:51] came and died to give his life
[22:54] all right
[22:56] even the disciples as I was saying the
[22:58] other day where it says to them in Jesus
[23:01] actually breathed on them and said
[23:03] receive ye the Holy Ghost
[23:08] I mean if I was a person trying to prove
[23:10] a point that'd be the scripture I'd go
[23:11] to
[23:12] I said look at her he said receive it
[23:17] let's see thank God for a prophet
[23:19] that told us that that was a promise
[23:23] it didn't take place until the day of
[23:25] Pentecost
[23:29] but yet everybody thinks well you know
[23:32] eternal life is just a thought
[23:35] eternal life is a person right
[23:42] it's a person
[23:44] it's not a thought or an idea
[23:47] a concept or a Doctrine
[23:51] or something that you have
[23:54] it's a person of Jesus Christ Living
[23:56] inside of you
[23:57] by the new birth
[24:00] all right and by doing that then
[24:04] see we come to a wonderful position
[24:07] and we read our enrollments about the
[24:10] children of God
[24:14] and if we're children of God
[24:16] then we are joint heirs
[24:19] with Jesus Christ
[24:23] that is what we just read out of
[24:24] scripture
[24:27] we're Heirs of God
[24:31] now there was no way the human body
[24:36] human body are you understanding me
[24:38] there was no way that human body they
[24:41] lived on the earth years ago called
[24:43] Jesus Christ there was no way he could
[24:45] give you eternal life
[24:48] now I know what the Bible says come on
[24:51] don't get me messed up
[24:53] that the son had within him to be right
[24:56] he had within him
[24:58] the ability to bring eternal life into
[25:00] existence but it would have to wait
[25:03] until Calvary
[25:05] that was when it would come into
[25:06] existence not right then
[25:09] right see people who lay on with a
[25:11] little woman at the well you know she
[25:12] said we know that Dr Messiah Jesus
[25:15] brother random will say see there said
[25:17] that word was quickened right there sure
[25:20] it was
[25:21] it was quick unto her who was standing
[25:24] there
[25:27] and that quickening was eternal
[25:31] because it was a revelation
[25:34] but it didn't give the woman eternal
[25:36] life
[25:37] she had to go to Calvary you know what I
[25:39] mean she had to go to the upper room to
[25:41] receive the new birth
[25:43] see we just keep that in line I was
[25:46] talking another day waiting that was
[25:47] right now hunting him
[25:50] another random said in the seal book
[25:52] it's either in the
[25:55] right at the end of the six the old
[25:57] questions and answers or the seventh one
[25:58] of the right in there
[26:00] but around said go on with the same
[26:03] simple message
[26:06] he said because if you don't said you'll
[26:09] work yourself away from it
[26:11] now what is the same simple message
[26:18] one God
[26:22] what a baptism in the name of the Lord
[26:24] Jesus Christ
[26:25] no Eternal Hells
[26:27] serpent seed
[26:31] the truth of that godhead and how it is
[26:36] the new birth
[26:38] and how did its justification
[26:40] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[26:42] Ghost
[26:43] not just because you say you believe the
[26:45] message
[26:46] the devil does too so you're going to
[26:49] give him the Holy Ghost
[26:51] but you see the same simple message then
[26:54] then no matter where you go in the
[26:56] message and how deep you preach it
[26:59] you have something to be anchored to
[27:03] but if you get this fancy Doctrine
[27:06] the
[27:09] always was eternal
[27:11] I don't need eternal life I always was
[27:14] eternal I had eternal life when I come
[27:15] into the world
[27:16] well
[27:18] you've annihilated all of the doctrine
[27:20] of
[27:22] the Lord Jesus which was his first
[27:24] doctor and when he said you must be born
[27:25] again
[27:26] you've annihilated all of that
[27:28] you destroyed all of the Bible
[27:32] well yet that's not going to convert
[27:33] anybody
[27:35] but it may keep you and I from getting
[27:37] messed up with it you know
[27:40] that's why you say well brother there
[27:42] you sure are Stern and hard
[27:44] here's one thing about it you know what
[27:47] I believe amen
[27:49] you don't have to worry about what
[27:51] brother Dale believes you just sit down
[27:52] and listen
[27:53] you find out what he believes
[27:56] but I don't play around with the word
[27:58] amen
[28:00] I tell you what I believe right or wrong
[28:03] I'm going to tell you because if I'm
[28:05] wrong and you help me I'm I can be made
[28:07] right
[28:09] all right but are you listening and see
[28:11] what I'm saying then
[28:13] see then it's very easy to by way of the
[28:17] Prophet messenger
[28:19] and you see my background
[28:22] I've done been through this the message
[28:24] on Christ I miss your God reveal he said
[28:27] God had a plan and a purpose
[28:30] he had a motive then right
[28:32] doing it he was going to see
[28:36] his word achieved
[28:38] he was going to bring forth all of his
[28:40] attributes and things
[28:42] all right
[28:43] so he's going to do that
[28:46] but how could he do that
[28:49] and there's nobody lost
[28:54] he could be a father because he created
[28:56] us
[28:58] Adam Eve made him father
[29:01] the Angels made him God
[29:04] when they were created first you know
[29:05] object of worship
[29:08] when he was a Healer and a savior how
[29:11] could that be done
[29:13] so he could not make I gave you the
[29:15] quotes in the prophet he could not make
[29:18] you lost
[29:19] and die then die for your sins
[29:25] you're getting it wrong he can't make
[29:27] you lost
[29:30] where would you get that out of God
[29:34] working evil and I know even the Bible
[29:36] says
[29:38] I know good and evil
[29:40] I create evil Maybe
[29:43] but how can God
[29:46] create evil
[29:49] where did he get it from
[29:53] your God is an evil God
[29:57] no you look up and you see that he's
[29:59] saying I permit these things to come
[30:02] into being
[30:06] I allow these things to transpire
[30:11] to fulfill my word
[30:14] so he knew the prophet said if he
[30:16] created us
[30:17] with a free moral agency
[30:21] that's what he said we were
[30:23] right he said that even made us equal
[30:26] with him when he gave us free moral
[30:28] agency not equal as a God not being that
[30:31] way he gave us a choice
[30:33] we're predetermining wouldn't give you a
[30:36] choice
[30:39] predetermining that's it you can't go no
[30:41] other way
[30:42] but when he gave you a choice you could
[30:45] decide whether you wanted to be saved or
[30:46] not
[30:47] then he could look down
[30:50] and the prophet said it like this
[30:53] he knew people would be lost and would
[30:56] want to be saved so he made a way for
[30:58] them to be saved all right
[31:03] see in that way he could predetermine
[31:07] the fact that he would have to come and
[31:09] die
[31:11] so he could write it in the last book of
[31:12] life before the foundation of the world
[31:14] and be standing as the lamb slain
[31:19] but yet if he hadn't to come into the
[31:20] World 2000 years ago and fulfill that it
[31:23] would have made the Bible false prophecy
[31:26] so look what you're doing
[31:28] you might think that you don't need
[31:30] salvation
[31:34] and the people of this message May
[31:36] preach to their people that they don't
[31:37] need salvation they just need to believe
[31:40] that's a good old Baptist Doctrine
[31:44] I had enough of that one for another for
[31:47] about 10 years
[31:52] what you see to look at it and see that
[31:54] you must be born again
[31:59] it's not a choice or a thought
[32:02] it's a fact
[32:04] you must be born again of course if
[32:05] you're not born again you're lost
[32:08] yeah but but what about all these quotes
[32:10] well what about all of them
[32:12] keep reading read backwards and forth
[32:14] around that quote and see if this
[32:15] statement is not there the prophet said
[32:17] if you have eternal life you always was
[32:22] eternal
[32:27] that new birth gives you eternal life
[32:31] that eternal life is just as Eternal as
[32:33] God because it is God's life
[32:41] then giving you eternal life
[32:45] makes you a part of God
[32:49] not just something's thinking about
[32:52] so you can be in his thinking and still
[32:54] be lost
[32:57] but if you're a part of God you can
[32:59] never be lost
[33:01] you see the only way to have eternal
[33:02] life is to have his life
[33:05] come on how many years did it take to
[33:08] get it out of us
[33:11] that we believe that hell is eternal
[33:14] because we've been taught that all of
[33:16] her life
[33:17] you know
[33:19] the prophet said there's no such thing
[33:21] as an eternal hell
[33:24] because you'd have to have eternal life
[33:27] to live in hell
[33:31] amen and that would make hell Eternal
[33:33] because a place where you'd be at would
[33:34] be you know
[33:37] and you'd be burning for eternity
[33:40] but see that's a good old Baptist
[33:42] spiritum tactic you know
[33:44] scare people into being saved by
[33:46] threatening them
[33:48] with hell being Eternal and you're going
[33:49] to burn that one of these days for
[33:51] eternity
[33:55] but it ain't even in the scripture
[33:59] because if you have an eternal hell then
[34:02] you're going to have to put God in hell
[34:05] all right
[34:07] but you see
[34:10] as I said I don't want to be something
[34:12] God thought of
[34:16] because
[34:18] that leaves me still in a position
[34:21] that I must do something about it
[34:26] I must receive eternal life
[34:30] and that's what we're going to talk
[34:31] about today see I want to be a part of
[34:33] God
[34:35] now brother Dale that's just a little
[34:37] bit too far well now you tell me what
[34:39] eternal life is I ended up Wednesday
[34:41] talking about that
[34:44] you explained to me
[34:46] what eternal life is
[34:48] eternal life is the life of God
[34:50] there's only one
[34:53] eternal life
[34:54] that's Zoe
[34:56] God's own life
[34:58] all right
[35:00] now
[35:01] then I want to be
[35:04] what the scripture says I am
[35:07] that we read that we were his children
[35:11] the spirit Itself by our witness with
[35:13] our spirit that we are the children of
[35:16] God
[35:19] and if children
[35:22] in heirs
[35:24] watch him
[35:25] Heirs of God
[35:31] okay
[35:33] and join ours
[35:35] with Christ amen
[35:38] that's what we just read in Romans
[35:40] all right
[35:44] but see if we're a part of God
[35:48] and we can only be a part of God by the
[35:50] new birth
[35:53] there's no way us human Mortals
[35:57] could be part of God without God's Life
[35:59] coming in US
[36:01] that should be sensible
[36:03] yes what brother Dale you just you just
[36:05] don't understand the great revelation
[36:07] yeah I know it
[36:09] because your great Revelation is
[36:11] destroying the Bible and destroying the
[36:13] prophet's message
[36:15] by quoting him to death
[36:19] yes but he says I always was eternal
[36:23] read and see what he's talking about
[36:27] he said if you have eternal life you
[36:30] always was eternal
[36:33] he said if you don't have eternal life
[36:34] you're lost
[36:38] all right
[36:40] so what would it be then
[36:43] see I want to be a part of God
[36:46] well no no brother then what I want to
[36:48] do is be a son of God
[36:53] I'll get to it this afternoon we don't
[36:55] believe in Eternal sonship so now where
[36:57] are you going
[37:01] right
[37:04] right you want to be an eternal Son of
[37:06] God I wanted a Bible for it I want the
[37:08] prophets words for it
[37:13] a Son of God can't be eternal
[37:22] okay
[37:25] that's why Jesus had a beginning
[37:28] God never had a beginning
[37:31] now who are you talking about
[37:38] so you know what are you talking about
[37:39] that's just annihilated the
[37:42] understanding if you understand what I'm
[37:43] saying the word right around him would
[37:45] say Jesus had a beginning but God never
[37:47] had one
[37:48] he said that's the difference in Jesus
[37:50] and God
[37:53] he said God had eternal life Jesus
[37:56] he had a beginning
[37:58] now what's he talking about
[38:03] you don't realize that's just
[38:04] annihilated everything you could
[38:06] accomprehend or try to comprehend
[38:10] what part of Jesus was not eternal
[38:15] the body
[38:17] right
[38:18] so Jesus the body had a beginning
[38:25] but the God that was inside of there
[38:28] never had a beginning
[38:31] so it's whether or not we understand one
[38:32] God
[38:37] see that's the key to the whole thing
[38:38] the key to understanding how you can be
[38:40] part of God is to realize
[38:47] that that man that stood on the shores
[38:49] of God only two thousand years ago was a
[38:51] human body created
[38:54] that body was made Eternal in the
[38:56] resurrection in it and going up right
[38:59] now
[39:02] but yet while he was on Earth that body
[39:03] had to eat that body had to sleep that
[39:06] body was sick why because
[39:09] it had a beginning
[39:12] and it had to be made eternal
[39:16] and he did in his resurrection and
[39:18] Ascension
[39:20] see if you understand one God you don't
[39:22] have no problem
[39:26] see the one God then is not the father
[39:29] Son and Holy Ghost Blessed Trinity you
[39:31] know
[39:33] co-equal and co-eternal
[39:37] none of that sitting in scripture at all
[39:41] see Jesus
[39:42] the man that walked on the shores of
[39:44] Galilee the Bible said in him
[39:48] dwell the fullness of the godhead bodily
[39:54] that's why he could stand there and say
[39:57] when they said show us the father he
[39:59] said look
[40:02] if you've seen me you've seen the father
[40:06] why because God was inside that man
[40:12] that's where when that body dropped
[40:13] forth from Mary
[40:16] which is just an incubator
[40:18] to carry it but drop forth from Mary
[40:21] then God's own life came into that body
[40:30] all right in God's own life living in
[40:32] that body would be spirit and soul of
[40:34] God
[40:35] amen
[40:37] living in a mortal body
[40:42] and would take that mortal body to
[40:44] Eternity
[40:46] amen now what's the difference in you
[40:48] and what you're doing that's right
[40:50] amen
[40:52] we come into the world lost we know that
[40:54] or should do
[40:56] omed in on their way to hell
[40:59] the prophet said even him bastard born
[41:03] they don't want to quote brother Branham
[41:06] illegitimate child
[41:09] all of us are by the Fall
[41:12] right don't you talk about my my folks
[41:14] boy I'll tell you what well your folks
[41:17] are just like my folks
[41:22] nothing but that's why I said you black
[41:24] people you at least got something you
[41:26] can look back to
[41:28] you can run your roots to Africa we
[41:30] can't run Our Roots nowhere
[41:33] they call us a Caucasian I give my own
[41:36] term of that 40 years ago we ain't
[41:38] nothing but a concoction
[41:42] we're just a mixed up breed
[41:46] we can't run it back
[41:48] yeah you're thrown off of my parents no
[41:50] I'm not
[41:52] you got any sense at all you are
[41:55] all right but listen
[41:58] we know we're lost
[42:02] now how can I then
[42:06] in this life become
[42:09] a part of God
[42:14] it would have to mean that he would have
[42:17] to impart that eternal life
[42:23] that's why the prophet will say
[42:26] it like this a good point
[42:29] would you send a child to die in your
[42:31] place or would you go yourself
[42:35] he said God never sent a son to die that
[42:37] he came himself
[42:39] that's why he's called son we'll get
[42:41] more this evening why because he's in
[42:44] flesh labeling its son
[42:47] that's why he's called a son but show me
[42:49] the Bible where he's an eternal son
[42:55] you can't find it
[42:58] all right but to be a part of God then I
[43:02] must receive eternal life
[43:06] and I received that by the new birth
[43:10] now then that life that's within me
[43:14] is God's own life
[43:19] give an eternal life to me
[43:23] all right now what am I doing as I said
[43:25] I want to go about Jesus
[43:27] let eternal life that was in him took
[43:29] that flesh to a change
[43:33] that's what the new birth is to do to
[43:35] you and I
[43:37] take us to a change
[43:40] to where the rest of us can be made
[43:41] eternal
[43:42] that's why this message had to come
[43:46] right you had eternal life down through
[43:48] time in the ages by the new birth
[43:53] but none of those ages could deal with a
[43:55] Redemption of a body
[43:58] that's why this message had to come
[44:01] to be the entire Bible
[44:03] but see to make then us to be part of
[44:06] God
[44:08] by the new birth
[44:11] not just make us a son of God
[44:15] see because the sun has a beginning
[44:22] you better start thinking about what the
[44:26] real truth of the word is
[44:28] are we a Son of God or are we God made
[44:31] manifest in flesh called a son
[44:34] now which one's correct
[44:38] if we're a Son of God that's eternal
[44:40] sonship
[44:46] come on
[44:48] but if we can receive the new birth
[44:53] and that Soul be made eternal
[44:57] then I have no problems with all the
[44:59] quotes I always was eternal what was
[45:01] always eternal
[45:02] the life of God
[45:05] simple
[45:06] so when the prophet says we always was
[45:09] eternal I say Amen
[45:12] because he's not talking about what
[45:15] you're looking at
[45:18] right he's talking about what's inside
[45:20] the person of eternal life
[45:24] they never forget that
[45:27] just because we have taken it now back
[45:29] up in the message part of talking about
[45:31] in the mind of God
[45:36] to get back into the mind of God that
[45:39] the prophet said in the back part of
[45:41] God's mind
[45:42] never forget
[45:45] where you come from
[45:51] don't ever forget the point that we must
[45:53] be born again
[45:57] because if you always was eternal you
[45:59] don't need to be born again
[46:02] and if people don't even realize that
[46:04] two Soul Doctrine is still here
[46:06] because that's what I told them then
[46:09] two Soul Doctrine was
[46:11] if you was
[46:13] like Judas he only had one soul
[46:16] that come from the Devil
[46:19] if you could be born again you had two
[46:21] Souls one from the devil and one from
[46:23] God that made Satan a Creator so yeah
[46:25] the message and now the Bible
[46:27] okay
[46:29] but I told him I said all right let's go
[46:31] along with it
[46:35] if you say all you had to do was kill
[46:36] that old soul I'll just get me a gun and
[46:39] the old Soul's gone you automatically in
[46:42] heaven
[46:43] people don't like my ideas
[46:49] me
[46:52] and I don't like my ideas
[46:56] and that's the word surely don't
[46:59] you take a man out here and he's raping
[47:01] a raped a child and molested or
[47:03] something else
[47:05] put him in jail
[47:07] you don't have to kill him
[47:13] put him in jail the rest of his life but
[47:15] castrate him before you send him there
[47:19] then you ain't got no worries about him
[47:20] the rest of his life
[47:23] people don't like my ideas
[47:29] but if you had those type of ideas you'd
[47:31] sure do it away with a lot of that
[47:32] garbage can call the laws
[47:35] of the land
[47:39] but get the point
[47:43] in God's thinking right
[47:50] in God's thinking
[47:54] he had a family
[47:56] sure amen
[48:00] hey come on this is kind of a little bit
[48:02] ahead but we'll back up to it later
[48:04] he had a family
[48:08] he had offspring
[48:12] well you said well how in the world can
[48:14] you prove that because we are now
[48:18] right come on are you thinking we are
[48:21] now the children of God
[48:23] we just read it
[48:25] and we are his offspring
[48:28] and we're Heirs of God which means
[48:30] whatever God's God I've got
[48:32] right
[48:34] and join The Heirs
[48:36] with Jesus Christ to make sure that this
[48:38] anchors down real good amen
[48:40] to show you where it come from
[48:42] because if he hadn't to give that life
[48:44] that was in him
[48:46] you and I wouldn't have eternal life
[48:51] he had to release that life that was in
[48:53] him to go out so there's your one God
[48:56] body of man
[48:58] spirit and soul Eternal God
[49:05] he had to down Calvary release that Soul
[49:07] then he could come back
[49:10] not just the spirit because the spirit
[49:12] is already anointing
[49:14] Spirit at that time was anointing people
[49:16] like Caiaphas they would even prophesy
[49:18] of the coming of the Lord and what had
[49:20] to be done
[49:23] Balaam could even prophesy
[49:28] but yet he couldn't dig down in far
[49:29] enough to see the truth of the Soul
[49:36] Jesus was a very Body Spirit and soul of
[49:39] almighty God
[49:40] and that's not one that's Doctrine
[49:45] number one he is is not one that's
[49:47] Doctrine because there was a time that
[49:50] he was dealing with Father the time
[49:52] dealing with son and time dealing with
[49:53] the Holy Ghost that's good but you know
[49:55] what the rest of it is
[49:57] he the one that's doctrines one like
[49:59] your finger
[50:02] Jesus in the Old Testament Jesus living
[50:04] back here and Jesus now
[50:07] that's a Oneness Doctrine we don't
[50:09] believe in that
[50:11] right you know why I don't believe in it
[50:12] because I believe your God made manifest
[50:16] that's the reason I don't believe in
[50:17] Oneness I don't believe right around him
[50:19] was the teaching and Oneness why because
[50:21] he taught me just what I believe
[50:23] I'm looking at children of God
[50:27] Sons and Daughters of a living God
[50:30] who have received the new birth
[50:34] making their soul Eternal amen
[50:38] no wonder Paul could say we are his
[50:39] offspring they're in the book of Acts
[50:44] because that's who we are
[50:46] but you know what he was quoting from
[50:48] if you think I wouldn't write while I go
[50:50] into thinking the Pharisees and
[50:52] Sadducees and the different ones that
[50:53] people didn't believe in eternal life
[50:54] back there
[50:56] what was Paul talking about get into
[50:58] accident where he's talking
[51:01] he said some of your poets
[51:08] talking about what they believe
[51:12] some of your poets have said
[51:15] we are his offspring
[51:21] see they believed it
[51:26] why do you want to believe any Doctrine
[51:27] if there's no connection to eternal life
[51:33] you know
[51:35] oh I swear I never could understand the
[51:37] Sadducees I still don't understand them
[51:40] how they couldn't believe in the
[51:41] resurrection
[51:45] I still have my own thoughts on that but
[51:47] that's my own thoughts
[51:49] my own thoughts is that that they
[51:50] believed in the final day Resurrection
[51:52] but not a resurrection in any other way
[51:55] the Pharisees took a resurrection
[51:57] because they could do with Enoch and a
[52:00] Elijah and the different ones who were
[52:02] translated and things that happened
[52:05] would you tell me them sad you see said
[52:07] we're going to die and just become
[52:08] non-existent I've never believed that
[52:10] was a Sadducees Doctrine maybe now I
[52:13] said that's me
[52:17] because it's what we've always said
[52:19] Pharisees believed in the resurrection
[52:21] Sadducees don't believe in the
[52:22] resurrection
[52:25] now
[52:27] what do they believe
[52:29] well probably I mean they had to go
[52:31] somewhere where'd he go we don't know
[52:32] where he goes God he don't go nowhere
[52:36] see we get something in their mind
[52:39] that's been handed down and we just take
[52:41] it for being a thought
[52:44] instead of studying it out to see what's
[52:46] going on
[52:49] well I I just brought it down I don't
[52:51] want to get confused don't worry about
[52:53] you already are
[52:56] you're already confused don't worry
[52:58] about it
[52:59] we've been confused all of our life
[53:02] we're getting out of the confusion by
[53:04] the revealed word
[53:10] and that's the only way
[53:12] it will get out of confusions by the
[53:14] review word
[53:17] but you see Church
[53:22] being a part of God
[53:26] I don't know where you think about that
[53:28] like I do
[53:32] see if you ask most people how they got
[53:33] their self well I'm a son of Jesus it
[53:35] was a son of God
[53:40] Jesus the flesh never gave you eternal
[53:43] life
[53:44] he could not give eternal life
[53:48] even when he said the son had power
[53:51] to give life he's not talking about the
[53:55] flesh
[53:57] he's talking about the one that was in
[53:59] him
[54:02] ask anything
[54:05] ask the father anything well he said
[54:07] because it's a father asking
[54:09] not you asking
[54:12] I remember about 40 years ago my wife
[54:15] said well that's simple to understand
[54:18] it's not you asking it's the Holy Ghost
[54:19] asking his father this one's asking
[54:27] Jesus said I do nothing until my father
[54:29] shows me
[54:31] that was the outside connected with the
[54:33] inside
[54:36] but he was a part of God
[54:40] he was a fullness
[54:43] you and I are apart
[54:45] that can make the fullness
[54:47] you know what brother Brown said you
[54:48] know that the godhead is not complete
[54:50] without you I get time that's in here
[54:52] somewhere
[54:54] the God he is not complete without you
[54:57] if you have eternal life today God is
[54:59] not complete without you you see why
[55:01] you're going to go in a Rapture you're
[55:03] going to go on a change
[55:07] and I don't mean this wrong and don't
[55:09] think it stupidly but you can't sin
[55:11] enough to be lost if you're already born
[55:12] again
[55:14] but don't worry about it you won't want
[55:16] to
[55:19] but it'd be impossible to be able to do
[55:21] it
[55:26] well he could give me the Holy Ghost and
[55:28] take it away he can give and take away
[55:29] that's good Methodist
[55:32] as Indian giver
[55:34] probably said we don't believe in that
[55:38] when you see what I'm getting at
[55:42] the
[55:42] eternal life
[55:44] that you and I have by the new birth and
[55:46] that's the only way to get it
[55:50] now even the foolish virgins they don't
[55:53] get eternal life here
[55:55] right
[55:57] right they have to go to the watch on
[55:59] judgment
[56:01] to be given eternal life they don't have
[56:03] it here but yet they're Justified and
[56:05] sanctified
[56:07] good believers
[56:10] but they don't get eternal life until
[56:11] they go to the whites on judgment
[56:15] but you see the Bride of Jesus Christ
[56:16] receives eternal life here by going
[56:18] through justification sanctification of
[56:20] baptism with all the ghost
[56:22] and receiving the life of God we have
[56:24] the new birth
[56:25] then that new birth is a part of God
[56:30] making us a child of God
[56:33] now watch that one this evening
[56:36] because I know your mind will hook onto
[56:38] a thought
[56:40] see then you'd say a child of God is the
[56:42] son of God
[56:44] that's what I'm trying to get out of the
[56:45] way this morning where that won't go
[56:47] into your mind this evening
[56:52] he said well the child of God is the Son
[56:54] of God now what are you talking about he
[56:56] Sons you talking about sonship or what
[56:57] are you talking about
[57:00] we don't believe in eternal sonship
[57:03] and the children of God are eternal
[57:09] but the brown said Jesus was God made
[57:11] manifest in flesh called a son
[57:17] because what else you're going to call
[57:18] him
[57:20] it was it when they throwed the Hebrew
[57:22] children into the fiery furnace
[57:25] I always said that man had a pretty good
[57:26] who wouldn't Nebuchadnezzar
[57:29] he didn't we throw in threes and now
[57:31] there's four and he's like the son of
[57:34] God
[57:35] in other words if there's anything he's
[57:37] seen it had a son effect
[57:40] and anything that could keep them others
[57:42] from being killed
[57:43] and he could stand it too it had to be
[57:46] God
[57:49] so he had a good understanding
[57:52] but you see we get our thoughts into our
[57:54] mind and we we have trouble
[57:56] comprehending that we are The Offspring
[57:59] of God
[58:01] we're his children
[58:08] and his children existed with him
[58:11] now here we're going
[58:13] his children existed with him
[58:15] when he was self-existing
[58:22] all right
[58:24] see that's what I've been aiming at now
[58:26] listen
[58:28] if you don't agree with me office will
[58:30] be open
[58:34] see the children of God
[58:38] or God made manifest
[58:41] his attributes
[58:46] he said well that's making us back there
[58:49] you're not listening
[58:52] what if I said was the only thing that
[58:54] was with God in the beginning God
[58:57] when he dwelled alone
[59:00] he was self-existing but he had
[59:02] attributes he had his thinking
[59:06] his children was in his mind
[59:12] in his thinking
[59:18] the prophet said that gives an eternal
[59:20] quality to the elect
[59:22] I believe in eternal life
[59:27] and made the drawing to show you when it
[59:29] comes up to the mind and then going on
[59:31] back into
[59:32] the back part of God's mind
[59:37] and when you do you look back and you
[59:39] get there and you see Jesus Christ
[59:45] but not as a person
[59:49] he didn't stand back there that's
[59:51] eternal sonship
[59:53] you see Jesus Christ which was almighty
[59:55] God
[59:58] that's what I was trying to get across
[59:59] our lives with our lives this past
[1:00:01] Wednesday
[1:00:03] Jesus was the only name God ever had
[1:00:07] you want to know the name of God his
[1:00:09] name's Jesus
[1:00:10] simple
[1:00:11] he said I come to my father's name
[1:00:13] simple
[1:00:14] Jesus Christ
[1:00:16] he's the Eternal God
[1:00:20] amen Jesus the flesh at a beginning
[1:00:25] Jesus the Christ the Christ that went
[1:00:27] out of God was the logos
[1:00:29] that begin to create the speech
[1:00:34] the flesh wasn't back there
[1:00:36] well now if his flesh wasn't back there
[1:00:38] why do we want to be back there
[1:00:42] I told you is that still that old thing
[1:00:44] that bothers mankind called an ego
[1:00:49] we just want something special about
[1:00:51] this thing it's just got to be you know
[1:00:53] hey don't you think I'm pretty
[1:01:03] the only thing I want to know about it
[1:01:05] is
[1:01:07] tell me about my father
[1:01:15] and if Jesus is not a second person then
[1:01:17] why do you want to be a second person
[1:01:19] great
[1:01:21] but around said he's not a second person
[1:01:23] he's not even the first person because
[1:01:25] you see if you say he's the first person
[1:01:26] that means it's something different he
[1:01:28] said he is the person
[1:01:34] well see why Can't We Believe by the new
[1:01:36] birth that we are the children of God
[1:01:37] that we're his offspring
[1:01:42] and that eternal life that we have
[1:01:45] is the eternal life God had before the
[1:01:47] world ever begun
[1:01:49] so he had his children with him
[1:01:53] but not back there as we look at it
[1:01:59] when we say he was there with his
[1:02:01] children with his offspring we look
[1:02:04] around
[1:02:06] one two three four five get out behind a
[1:02:08] tree 11 12 13 14 feet
[1:02:14] the prophet of God said we weren't
[1:02:16] Spirits we were nothing he said we was
[1:02:18] any thinking
[1:02:22] what was in his thinking
[1:02:24] his offspring his children
[1:02:29] be careful now that's predestination
[1:02:33] they got a couple of messages later get
[1:02:35] on to it
[1:02:36] we'll mark here and start here and go
[1:02:38] that way
[1:02:43] but what does it mean to be a part of
[1:02:45] God
[1:02:47] amen
[1:02:52] the first part it means is we're not all
[1:02:56] right because I can't be all by myself
[1:03:00] brother Mo years ago helped me to
[1:03:02] understand that he said we think about
[1:03:04] cutting up God like an apple
[1:03:07] you know parts and we give away the
[1:03:10] Apple
[1:03:11] and we're out of parts
[1:03:14] it's no such thing with God the more he
[1:03:17] gives away the greater he becomes
[1:03:21] if you'd ever get that into your mind
[1:03:23] you'd want to try to find out what you
[1:03:25] are and what you're here for the prophet
[1:03:27] of God said whenever I'd realize who she
[1:03:28] is and what she's here for
[1:03:31] we're here to strip Satan from his doing
[1:03:34] the people's mind
[1:03:38] and get it out of our minds
[1:03:41] the things that we've been taught
[1:03:50] you see then to be that
[1:03:54] it wasn't you and I backed our as people
[1:03:58] he was self-existing
[1:04:03] now come on he existed alone well you
[1:04:05] just said he existed with his family
[1:04:07] that's exactly what I said
[1:04:11] because when I look at it I'm looking at
[1:04:13] a family as to being part of God
[1:04:17] I'm not looking at as a god having a
[1:04:20] family that's what you're thinking
[1:04:23] you're thinking that I'm saying God is
[1:04:24] here and he's got a family that's not
[1:04:26] what I'm talking about
[1:04:32] I'm talking about God with his children
[1:04:34] his offspring
[1:04:37] that's a part of him
[1:04:43] remember sons are not eternal
[1:04:46] they have a beginning
[1:04:50] there's no such thing as eternal sonship
[1:04:56] we'll go to this evening to know what
[1:04:58] the prophet said there's an eternal
[1:05:00] godship
[1:05:06] there's an eternal godhead
[1:05:16] but think about it
[1:05:21] this whole thing is
[1:05:23] to me is
[1:05:25] it like a person with a it's a carnal
[1:05:28] comparison with a person with their
[1:05:29] family
[1:05:32] and like I told you we can take the DNA
[1:05:34] and you can run a take a man especially
[1:05:36] and run it because they can run to women
[1:05:38] the same way because they have the DNA
[1:05:40] and they transmit it
[1:05:41] and you can run back with it with Eve to
[1:05:43] the Garden this as well as you can run
[1:05:45] back with Adam to the garden
[1:05:46] you get into science and study it a
[1:05:48] little
[1:05:49] we got nurses that can tell you a little
[1:05:51] bit about it
[1:05:54] but listen
[1:05:58] that Eternal God
[1:06:03] had within him
[1:06:07] the attributes
[1:06:11] and those attributes is what you and I
[1:06:13] are
[1:06:16] it's like I said it's carnal comparison
[1:06:18] though
[1:06:19] because see you can take you can say
[1:06:21] well there was a day that that Wade and
[1:06:25] Terence and Anna
[1:06:27] was in me
[1:06:30] because you're coming down to a germ
[1:06:33] form
[1:06:36] but that's not a way to see God because
[1:06:38] the prophet of God covered it back to a
[1:06:41] a germ and a gene
[1:06:47] you see my kids could be in me in a germ
[1:06:50] form but they can't be
[1:06:52] you know I didn't have them my my daddy
[1:06:54] didn't have my kids in him as a germ for
[1:06:57] him
[1:06:59] are you listening
[1:07:02] my daddy didn't have
[1:07:05] weighed in me you know and that way
[1:07:08] coming that way
[1:07:10] my daddy had a gene
[1:07:12] a DNA makeup
[1:07:15] that could be transmitted down to me
[1:07:20] and then through wedlock a germ could
[1:07:23] come into being to produce a child
[1:07:26] are you with me
[1:07:29] so then even in the natural you can't
[1:07:31] run it back
[1:07:33] when the prophet says we were in our
[1:07:35] great great great grandfather
[1:07:37] you know you wasn't back there as a germ
[1:07:39] some kind of a sperm
[1:07:45] he was there only in his at a gene form
[1:07:53] that has to be transmitted down to
[1:07:55] become a germ
[1:07:58] see God
[1:08:00] we were part of God to eternal life that
[1:08:03] we have
[1:08:04] not the people that we're looking at
[1:08:06] right
[1:08:07] not Body Spirit and soul of a human
[1:08:09] mortal being
[1:08:14] but that eternal life
[1:08:17] that was in God in the beginning
[1:08:20] is the eternal life that's in You Now by
[1:08:23] the new birth
[1:08:25] right
[1:08:27] and that new verse coming in you giving
[1:08:30] you eternal life that makes you a child
[1:08:32] of God
[1:08:38] it doesn't make you a child of Jesus it
[1:08:41] was a child of God you're getting into
[1:08:43] your natural genomic genealogies
[1:08:49] that fleshed man had to be made eternal
[1:08:58] this flesh man has to be made eternal
[1:09:02] to really be the children we want him to
[1:09:04] be
[1:09:06] why does it say now I'm going to get
[1:09:08] this point and not as quick as I forget
[1:09:10] the notes
[1:09:12] why does it say that we will be as I
[1:09:14] read there
[1:09:15] when does it say we are the children of
[1:09:17] God
[1:09:19] and if we're the children of God then
[1:09:21] we're heirs
[1:09:22] of God
[1:09:24] right
[1:09:27] then why does it turn around and say and
[1:09:29] join ours with Jesus Christ
[1:09:35] come on you got your scripture
[1:09:38] where is it
[1:09:40] Romans
[1:09:43] 8 16 and the spirit itself birth witness
[1:09:45] with our spirit that we are the children
[1:09:47] of God
[1:09:48] and if children then heirs
[1:09:52] means hold it just a minute now and
[1:09:54] think about what you're saying ain't no
[1:09:56] English major but that does mean what
[1:09:59] it's saying right stop
[1:10:03] don't period it and start another thing
[1:10:05] stop and think about what you're saying
[1:10:10] and his children than heirs
[1:10:15] Heirs of God
[1:10:22] and as a conjunction
[1:10:25] if you want to translate it even that's
[1:10:27] fine
[1:10:29] and join ours with Christ
[1:10:37] now what does that mean
[1:10:43] and he didn't say now so follow me
[1:10:47] he didn't say join ours with Jesus
[1:10:52] because that connects to the flesh
[1:10:56] all right have a priest enough of it you
[1:10:58] understand me
[1:10:59] he didn't say John Ayers with Jesus said
[1:11:01] John Arthur Christ
[1:11:04] is the anointing the logos the theophany
[1:11:07] etc etc that come out of God the Son of
[1:11:10] God that came out of God in the
[1:11:12] beginning he said let there be
[1:11:16] but wanted to say Heirs of God if it's
[1:11:19] Heirs of God that's eternal life what a
[1:11:21] wonderful thing to think about
[1:11:26] but then join ours
[1:11:27] with Christ
[1:11:31] you see because if Christ had not come
[1:11:33] into the being in a flesh man
[1:11:36] you and I could not be Heirs of God
[1:11:40] he made the way that we could be The
[1:11:43] Heirs of God
[1:11:45] and we're joint heirs
[1:11:48] but around said whatever was lost in the
[1:11:50] garden
[1:11:51] he said Jesus Christ brought back
[1:11:56] he says then watch it and there's a
[1:11:58] quote laying in here he said then he's
[1:12:00] not waiting on him said he's waiting on
[1:12:03] you
[1:12:06] you realize it
[1:12:08] God is waiting on you and I to realize
[1:12:10] Who We Are
[1:12:14] well I'm a Child of God
[1:12:16] yeah but how do you believe that
[1:12:20] look how easy it is to be you're a child
[1:12:22] of Jesus it was a child of God now
[1:12:25] you're a grandchild
[1:12:27] so you don't have errors with your
[1:12:28] father
[1:12:31] see The Heirs of the father come first
[1:12:33] read it
[1:12:37] Heirs of God
[1:12:40] and Joint heirs
[1:12:44] see bringing it down to where that
[1:12:46] that's the only way you and I can have
[1:12:49] eternal life
[1:12:54] is for God to become flesh
[1:12:58] and dwell Among Us
[1:13:01] live in a human body
[1:13:04] and on Calvary
[1:13:06] release that soul out of that body
[1:13:11] the word could go up
[1:13:13] and then come back the prophet said he
[1:13:15] sent back on the day of Pentecost
[1:13:17] it is soul in the form of the baptism of
[1:13:19] the Holy Ghost
[1:13:21] he said after it's given out here and
[1:13:22] giving out here and giving out
[1:13:24] it'll all come together
[1:13:30] see the eternal life that we have
[1:13:32] is what was in God
[1:13:34] before the world
[1:13:37] not you and I as peoples
[1:13:41] and I hope you're listening to Jesus the
[1:13:43] flesh was not in God in the beginning
[1:13:47] you know what I mean because that would
[1:13:49] have put somebody standing there
[1:13:54] but Jesus is not a a second or third
[1:13:57] person he is the person
[1:14:00] that's the only way you and I can get
[1:14:03] eternal life
[1:14:04] that's what he was trying to tell
[1:14:05] Nicodemus
[1:14:07] that you must be born again
[1:14:10] I've got to go what was he explaining to
[1:14:12] him that's why Nicodemus he said if I
[1:14:14] can't tell you these things I'll even
[1:14:16] talk to you
[1:14:17] he was finally telling him I've got to
[1:14:19] go to Calvary I've got to release a life
[1:14:22] that's within me or you cannot be born
[1:14:24] again
[1:14:26] come on wouldn't that what he was
[1:14:27] telling me
[1:14:28] there's the only way it could be done
[1:14:32] the only way you can be saved today is
[1:14:34] for Jesus Christ come and live in you
[1:14:39] then that Christ that come and live in
[1:14:41] you and I always was eternal
[1:14:44] I can rejoice and take I don't have to
[1:14:47] deny anything the prophet says
[1:14:50] I can take all he says and it'll come
[1:14:52] together
[1:14:54] and if you have eternal life today that
[1:14:57] eternal life in you always was eternal
[1:15:06] you shall receive the gift of the Holy
[1:15:08] Ghost
[1:15:09] what is brother random what is
[1:15:11] we ask the prophet to answer questions
[1:15:14] right
[1:15:15] around him what is the gift of God
[1:15:21] he said it's eternal life
[1:15:24] through Jesus Christ
[1:15:31] right
[1:15:32] see we've got somebody we can go ask the
[1:15:34] questions too
[1:15:36] of course that's the way people think
[1:15:37] those are he's not here to answer well
[1:15:39] he's already answered it
[1:15:43] what is it Christ the mystery God's
[1:15:45] revealed where he said brother random
[1:15:47] said what is
[1:15:49] the new birth or the baptism what is a
[1:15:52] new birth thing he said he says it's the
[1:15:54] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:15:56] Jesus Christ coming living in you
[1:16:00] all you got to do is just say sit down
[1:16:02] in front of your computer
[1:16:04] and do me a favor
[1:16:07] in case I don't get back to preaching on
[1:16:09] this month
[1:16:10] you that look on your computer Line run
[1:16:12] in part of God
[1:16:18] just run in that lock it in run it in
[1:16:21] part of God
[1:16:25] and see that if ever quote
[1:16:29] of that
[1:16:31] I forgot how many there is
[1:16:35] way up the high number because I looked
[1:16:37] at him
[1:16:43] what is it being a part of God
[1:16:47] every one of those quotes you'll see him
[1:16:49] relating
[1:16:50] that we must be born again
[1:16:57] go through it when you go
[1:17:00] it'll really give you something to do I
[1:17:02] like to sign homework
[1:17:07] go home and run it in your computer
[1:17:11] go and run in in his thinking
[1:17:15] run in attributes of God
[1:17:19] and be ready to read for an hour
[1:17:25] well because sometimes it'll be 50 70
[1:17:28] 500 300.
[1:17:31] but if you're really going to do it
[1:17:34] when I run those things in
[1:17:38] I read them
[1:17:40] because I do not want to leave one of
[1:17:42] them out to where that it would seem
[1:17:45] contrary
[1:17:47] I want to read what he says
[1:17:54] if we're a part of God
[1:17:56] then God is now being made manifest
[1:18:03] in the beginning was the word the word
[1:18:05] was with God and the Word was God and
[1:18:07] the Word was might flesh and dwelt Among
[1:18:09] Us
[1:18:10] well don't you believe that's for you
[1:18:11] and I
[1:18:16] like I was saying the other night about
[1:18:17] the name and his word being the same
[1:18:21] then you ought to be able to read
[1:18:22] Revelations 19 of their words coming on
[1:18:24] that white horse and it said he had a
[1:18:26] name written
[1:18:28] and no man you and it's called the word
[1:18:31] of God
[1:18:33] people going haywire trying to figure
[1:18:35] that out
[1:18:37] it's very simple
[1:18:38] his name is his word his word is his
[1:18:40] name
[1:18:42] his name is Jesus
[1:18:49] oh what brother Dale you don't
[1:18:51] understand the Bible says ask your
[1:18:53] father anything in my name that's two
[1:18:55] people
[1:19:00] Jesus said he had a father amen
[1:19:03] he did have a father
[1:19:06] brother Branham says it there in Hebrews
[1:19:09] 10 5 where it says the body that he said
[1:19:12] the father provided the body
[1:19:15] he did he couldn't provide his own body
[1:19:21] you see it's coming down to if we don't
[1:19:23] leave and let me say that again see the
[1:19:26] prophet said stay with a sign simple
[1:19:28] message
[1:19:32] well if you stay with the same simple
[1:19:33] message then everything else is going to
[1:19:34] fit into that
[1:19:36] but if not you're going to go that away
[1:19:39] and you're just going to get your ideas
[1:19:40] and your thoughts come on brother you
[1:19:42] get your ideas your thoughts your
[1:19:44] opinions
[1:19:46] and then you'll come up well we don't
[1:19:47] need salvation we just we just needed
[1:19:50] this message to tell us we're eternal
[1:19:56] read that part of God just do that
[1:20:00] do me that much of a favor and look of
[1:20:02] how many times
[1:20:05] that he's talking about
[1:20:07] you must receive the new birth
[1:20:09] you must be born again
[1:20:18] think on these things let's Stand
[1:20:19] Together
[1:20:21] what about it
[1:20:22] are you a part of God or
[1:20:25] what is it
[1:20:28] has God imparted his own life into you
[1:20:30] making him
[1:20:32] in you together as one
[1:20:36] see I do believe then before the
[1:20:37] foundation of the world that God dwelt
[1:20:39] Alone with his attributes you know what
[1:20:41] those attributes were his children
[1:20:46] but he was self-existing
[1:20:51] now I'm going to State this one more
[1:20:52] time because I've done it for 40 years
[1:20:57] see if you're going to make it
[1:20:58] predetermined predestinated
[1:21:00] predestinated predestinated I'm a
[1:21:02] predestinated seat he predestinated
[1:21:04] predestinated
[1:21:08] now when you go back to self-existing
[1:21:15] you just predestinated yourself out of
[1:21:17] existence
[1:21:19] you think that don't mean nothing one of
[1:21:22] these days it'll click what I'm talking
[1:21:24] about
[1:21:26] you just want to make yourself I just
[1:21:28] feel like I was back there he
[1:21:30] predestinated me
[1:21:33] well we just backed up into God's mind a
[1:21:36] little father
[1:21:37] and you're out that away
[1:21:43] and his children is back here
[1:21:49] are you listening
[1:21:52] his children are back here in his mind
[1:21:58] and you just predestinated yourself out
[1:22:01] of existence
[1:22:04] you become non-existent because you
[1:22:06] can't go any further
[1:22:08] than a predestinated stamp of what you
[1:22:11] think
[1:22:12] that you see when we get back to it when
[1:22:14] the morning star sign together and the
[1:22:16] sons of God shouted for Joy you can see
[1:22:18] how it can come all the way down
[1:22:20] those children
[1:22:23] will be made flesh
[1:22:26] but that's not eternal sonship
[1:22:30] it's the eternal godship
[1:22:35] he doesn't predestinate by his desires
[1:22:42] he said well you just said he had
[1:22:43] children did he desire to be made
[1:22:44] manifest right
[1:22:46] but he didn't make them to do that
[1:22:48] right they're part of him go ahead what
