TRANSCRIPT
========================================
you know we all want to be filled with God right yeah you know we sing those some more and more of you I've had it all but what I need is more of you I heard something one time said I want to be filled with God so much that when a mosquito bites me he goes out and says there was power and I believe that's the desire everyone was not satisfied with one one one experience with God but I believe there's multiple experiences multiple refilling of the Holy Spirit every time the word opens to you every time you receive a revelation from the word that's sort of that's a revival see and you shouldn't take that lightly and now the thing is just getting it from here button in here so that it can come into action all right and that's what we desire so you want to act on the word and not just have it as information because you know this scripture right here that there that we read in John chapter of John chapter 1 verse 22 this is when when the Pharisees and they came to John and said and they were asking him this if you start thus there verse 19 assists and this is the record of John when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him who art thou and he confessed and did not not but confessed I am NOT the Christ and they asked him what then art thou Elias and he said I am NOT although that prophet and the answer no then said they unto Him who art thou but now watch the reason why you are asking they said this is the reason why they were asking that we may give an answer to them that sent us what say is dialed I said now take that right there and you see what the purpose that they were asking me who who are you they weren't asking for because they wanted to be a Muslim think what they wanted to repent they wanted to know they were asking because they wanted some information to take back to the but now you go you go and look at what happened for example with Paul at that time you saw when he was growing too and on the road to Damascus and the Lord appeared to him you know the scripture I'm talking about he asked the exact same question he said who art thou Lord see one question the same question one Brock was just for information and knowledge but the other one was for a transformation so you see sometimes sometimes we we might be uh we ask many questions or we might have that that might sit well this is just information you know this is just knowledge but it's got to be more than that he's got to be for temple cuz Paul from that day forward was not the same so he knew that when that when that light shone on him this is he said Lord who art thou he knew that that was that without what that wasn't from a man that was God no no it's got on the scene and from then on his name changed and this is life change and then on so you know in this world that we live in you know where we are so we're so getting used to you know google eyes the answers when you have we asked google things and we get the answer quickly you know we're becoming very slow oh yeah because of those things technologies really exceed it's beneficial it's wonderful I think one of the greatest things for new for me at least as far as technology is concerned is GPS DPS and I think it's wonderful and hopefully Google with Google Maps and there were charges for their further service but yeah but I think it's it it's been so helpful but really if you think about it ice deliver pizzas for Papa John's and we didn't how do you have GPS back in the 90s yeah I would have to look at a map and remember their album and they not go and not get there and see now now we would punch it on the GPS and the GPS is doing all the work and back then my mind was doing the now that's cases of dementia a lot of things like that because people are not using their right in hi they're not adding no more wrinkles to their brain like I was talking about ago and then in that and that's that's that's that's why it's good you know we get involved with things that kind of exercise the mind you know how the chest is one of my favorites so chess is great but but we're so used to these Google eyes dancers now but if you think about it you know God answers quickly there's verses in the Bible that says I will answer you know you call it to me and I will answer speedily you know a lot of that this is that just lets me know that he's the original Google he answer speedily maybe not at the timeframe that you think that he should answer me but but to him you know one day is a thousand years and a thousand years is one day to him you see so he's the one who gives us the word he said I will answer you click the Outlands to me quickly maybe not in your timeframe it could take five years six years ten years but to him that's quick because he knows exactly the time that you need that answer it can't be any anytime sooner bikini time later it's exactly at that moment and so that's why I call him the perfect Google he sees the answers quickly and he gives the exact answer so but you know sometimes by the word where we read that we either we're either a stop a lot of the work or where they're changed by the work you know there's there's there scriptures in the Bible for example in Luke chapter 2 I'll go there real quick to nurse is 47 Just Breathe I guess from verse 42 assists and when he was 12 years old speaking of Jesus they went up to Jerusalem after the custom of the Beast and when they had fulfilled the days as they returned the Child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem and Joseph and his mother knew not of it now you you think is your child PL you know it shouldn't be you looking out after your child but see they were so consumed and so concerned with because in fact then they have to travel you know and it was like they it was like whole families traveling and the reason why they would do it that way is because they could protect one another for my thieves that would come on the way and things like that so I'm sure there was a big caravan of people traveling and so yeah many little children that you weren't careful they could probably get loose and you not know where they where they're at so that was the case from here with Mary and Joseph and when they had fulfilled those days as they returned the Child Jesus tarried behind them through some and Joseph and his mother knew not of it but they supposing him to have been in the company you see they went a day's journey and they sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintances you think about you've gone a day without your your your your child without that your lives are night but that's exactly what the Bible says they went a day's journey without Jesus being around them and I guess they were just so comfortable among their family kinfolks that you know what I don't have them something I you know my brother or my sister you know they must be watching them you know look they left Jesus behind know that he was and when they saw him the signal Mozart and it came to pass that after three days they found him in the temple so three days later they were looking for him right I'm sorry let this verse 45 I'm get ahead and when they found him now they turned back again to Jerusalem seek me now that they realize they lost him now they're looking for you and it's the same thing with the United States if we don't realize that we need and you don't seek him you're not gonna find that's what you said seek and you shall find you know not and it shall be opened unto you and I think sometimes we have a hard time believing that that when you go to prayer when you get down to pray you are you are a bomb you know before before God them and that's an explosion to them to the devil safe alert when you get down to prayer in sincerity not just not just in a ritual but in a sincere way Lord it's you and I'm and I have this need sometimes maybe we didn't even we don't even have to bring needs before you sometimes you get in a quiet place and just just listen and just kind of just meditate on him that brings him that brings him on the scene I don't know for me Saints but that just being personal with you over something what helps me enter in is I think I think of God now I know he's a Keenan right and I just feel like I'm coming before him and he's sitting on the throne he's sitting on the throne and I imagine the Hoffmans head of Christ see the way he's looking and he's looking at me concerned he's looking at me with a concern that that he's concerned about that he wants me to feel good he wants me to get me to meet my need and and so that kind of helps me enter intimacy so visualize them in that way of that if that will help you you know visualize them in those in those ways because it's good to enter into good sincere prayer but anyways here's Mary and Joseph and they lost and they lost him and so they go back to looking for him in that in verse 46 they came to pass that after three days they found him in the temple sitting in the middle of God in the midst of the doctors both hearing them and asking them questions now watch verse 47 and all that heard him Jesus now all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers but we never read where they were changed by his understandings and the answers people are astonished as powerful but nothing ever happens about that they never take action post innocency for whatever reason and when they saw him they were amazed and his mother had said unto him see they were amazed I think a lot of people sometimes they come they come to church and they remain and it's a lot it's a lot like that at the beginning when you don't have a real grounded word birth it's like that at the beginning it's Victor's baby it could be like that you have to be very careful to not just be astonished by the word or astonished by the revelation or astonished by the depth of the word man that's powerful but then you can go out and then we don't do anything about that that's that's why that's what kills us that's why it hurts us and so many times you know we've seen it here in this church we've seen it that people you see them fairly excited about the word seem very then some point later they're not hear anything so it's one thing to be astonished by the word and changed by the word I want to be changed see I want to be change it's okay at the beginning to be astonished and amazed I believe that's the human element of it because of Revelation think about it sings a revelation isn't something that just goes directly to your heart when you hear the word it doesn't just go directly to your heart you have to process it here first right you have to hear it here and then process it here the human element of it then it goes down to the heart but that's but that's if you continue in that word because not all the time not now right away God gives you a revelation sometimes you could hear maybe brother Dale saying something or a minister saying something and and you know that's the truth but now you know that's the truth you're not disputing it but it may not be till like two years later that you say oh my goodness that's exactly what I had heard that two years before Oh am i good and now that causes you to take action on that that's a revelation out there that's a revelation the best example I can give is water baptism Jesus Christ a lot of people out here baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus but it's not a revelation to them I mean you can know water baptism in Lord Jesus Christ that's just information sometimes we get it confused with Revelation knowing but when you act on it and you know the purpose the reason why you're doing it that's the full revelation of it see the revelation of the word to you I believe it's uh it's it's taking the physical part of it but then acting on that as well praise God we got minutes let's go to Matthew chapter 7 Matthew chapter 7 I know everybody's tired and everybody had had the Fall Festival yesterday and everything but just hang on just hold up [Music] sneaks away see like I'm not sleek Matthew 7 Matthew 7 28 and 29 the Bible says here and it came to pass and it came to pass when Jesus had ended these sayings the people were astonished at his doctrine where he taught them as one having Authority and not as the scribes we don't here we don't read with that dr. changes them see but you see would you see that they were astonished look at that the word astonished amazed astonish in another place I was looking at last night gave something a different different though [Music] to stun or strike done with sudden fear terror surprise or wonder to amaze to confound with with some sudden passion daniel was astonished at the vision now we're Stunna shhhht that's wonderful that's app it's good now let's do something enough let's lift this because the word the word is not in need only or it word only Amen we just don't want it just we don't want it just information we want a transformation by that word two-strike without a fifth to strike with sudden and usually greater wonder surprise amen praise God and then another instance in Silicon John John 732 they said they said about then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees and they said unto them why have you brought him officers answered never a man spake like this man [Music] but that never takes them you see we don't see where those officers you know in that in that specific scripture they were changed that they follow Jesus they are they are they may be I don't know they were enough Illuminati did the word will cause you to act on on that work amen and that's what that's what we want to do is act act on the word grace go see Jesus for example the phrase Dow has the words of eternal life right Peter said those things where can we go you're the only one that has the words of eternal life but when Peter said that he wasn't born again you see isn't he he had it here and he knew that that was the Christ but really what sealed it for him was when he got the Holy Ghost in the upper room because what happened that that he received about him knowing the Christ caused him to act on the day of Pentecost he took action boldness came upon him and he started thinking the word and was building one word on top a word on top of word on top of word so it's a fight him to action when that really became a revelation now you're not just the Christ but you're my Lord Lord the Christ II see Jesus was recognizing his day not as a powerful speaker but as a speaker of powerful words sometimes sometimes uh you know we don't always need to have the whooping hollering that's one thing but pay attention to the words that are being spoken you know that's what brings power see amen so anybody have any comments or anything like that so let's just just a little thought you know wasn't anything big we're running out of time this is to be his stuff not just the astonished by the word but let's be changed by the word and there's other other examples you can [Music] right yes like when he was 12 years old talking to this you know you need the word now you know I think he was brother Brenda said it says something on the lines up he probably may not even know that he was saying those things Jesus at that age I mean you think of a 12 year old 10 and you know you know fella she's 12 years old you know I can see the her maturity level one sometimes they might say things they might mean you know what they're talking about in their mind they might think they do but but but sometimes you know but it was because he was the word see all of God was in him so it was that word speaking through so and I think that's a quote from brother Brandon I'm not mistake I heard it the other day any other comments or questions we've got like two more minutes so Thomas you need to change and the word to stop the minute go spin and end with a bass you know we're seeing I'm amazed all right let's do something about it I'm amazed that you love me well I love you too boy and let me show it let me show it to you and how do we show it my loving one another by the way we treat one another because John said that you know you love God you say you love God you're gonna love one another mr Barber suddenly one day yeah that is wonderful Saints I believe God is doing great things in our mist and even in this hour sometimes you know we think that that things have to be done a certain way that but you know God knows exactly what we need how it needs to be in order to affect us according to your makeup because the way he deals with where the Bob may not be the exact same when he deals with me because brother bob is made up a different way than I am but it's always gonna be by the word but by the truth so god bless you [Music]
