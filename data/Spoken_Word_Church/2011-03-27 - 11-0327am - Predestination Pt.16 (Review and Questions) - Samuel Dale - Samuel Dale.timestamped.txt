[39:00] of our Lord Jesus Christ who ha blessed
[39:02] us with all spiritual blessings we're at
[39:04] now in Heavenly places in Christ
[39:07] according as he had chosen Us in him
[39:10] before the foundation of the world that
[39:12] we should be holy and Without Blame
[39:14] before him in love having predestinated
[39:17] us unto the adoption of children by
[39:19] Jesus Christ to himself according to the
[39:22] good pleasure of his will to the praise
[39:24] of the glory of his grace wherein he
[39:27] hath made us accepted in the blood in
[39:29] whom we have Redemption through his
[39:31] blood the Forgiveness of sins according
[39:33] to the riches of his grace wherein he ha
[39:36] abounded toward us in all wisdom and
[39:39] Prudence having made known Prudence
[39:42] having made known unto us the mystery of
[39:45] his will according to his good pleasure
[39:47] which he had purposed in himself that in
[39:50] the dispensation of the fullness of
[39:52] times he might gather together in one
[39:54] all things in Christ
[39:57] both which are in heaven and which are
[39:59] on earth even in him in whom also we
[40:02] have obtained an inheritance being
[40:05] predestinated according to the purpose
[40:07] of him who worketh all things after the
[40:10] counsel of his own will that we should
[40:12] be to the praise of his glory who first
[40:15] trusted in Christ you may be seated the
[40:18] Lord at his Blessing to the reading of
[40:20] the word
[40:22] now we've tried to
[40:25] cover
[40:27] on this series of predestination and we
[40:29] preached about 15 messages on it to try
[40:32] to get you to do and we'll see this
[40:35] afternoon that we will be
[40:38] leaving uh the more or less the the
[40:42] beginnings and and the start and the
[40:44] things like that of of predestination
[40:47] and coming down to life amen to where we
[40:51] live you say well we've been doing that
[40:52] it's true but our mind our main thought
[40:54] in our mind has been to try to to uh
[40:58] look backward because remember what we
[41:01] were talking about in
[41:02] predestination if you can't look as far
[41:05] backward as you can forward that's right
[41:07] or forward as you can backward then you
[41:10] don't really see the Eternal God so then
[41:13] that way you know we need to uh to uh
[41:17] get down now to where the earth a part
[41:19] of us living and then we'll we'll
[41:21] continue on with that but now remember
[41:25] the one thing that I told you all the
[41:27] way through this part of one point now
[41:32] if God doesn't know the
[41:35] beginning from the
[41:37] ending then what kind of a god do you
[41:41] serve that's right you know if he
[41:43] doesn't know all things then there's
[41:45] really no need of serving him he's just
[41:48] some kind of a god you con it up
[41:50] down through time and and it wouldn't do
[41:53] us any good whatsoever but I believe in
[41:55] in eternal etal God that you know his
[41:58] thoughts is always Eternal that's right
[42:01] now what he thought of is not always
[42:03] Eternal because you know anything has a
[42:07] beginning is not Eternal so a lot that
[42:10] he thought of is not Eternal and a lot
[42:12] he thought of one day will become
[42:14] Eternal that's right you know but still
[42:16] at the present stage of time there's a
[42:19] lot of things that are not into that
[42:22] Eternal State all right now so let's
[42:25] just run through just a little bit of a
[42:28] thought and then you know turn it over
[42:31] to you for the we'll take the questions
[42:33] and answers and things and and uh you
[42:36] know see what's on your mind about it
[42:38] but now remember never forget the
[42:41] point that when you're dealing with what
[42:44] is upon
[42:47] Earth all right everybody understand
[42:49] that point right see when you're dealing
[42:52] with what happens in
[42:55] time the existence upon Earth my whole
[42:58] point was to try to drive this down in
[43:01] that God's for
[43:05] knowledge he wouldn't predestinate
[43:08] remember according to his own desires
[43:11] that's right cuz he desired that
[43:13] everybody be saved right but he would
[43:16] predestinate according to his for
[43:19] knowledge all right and we seen that
[43:22] brother brand said now that predes that
[43:25] you know predestin
[43:26] what election even in the Ephesians
[43:29] parallels Joshua election looks back to
[43:31] forn knowledge and predestination looks
[43:33] to Destiny well all right then we looked
[43:35] and seen that that everything is
[43:37] predestination looks back right
[43:40] everything is looking back to for
[43:41] knowledge so never forget that amen
[43:44] every what you think about how great
[43:46] your Revelation is of predestination and
[43:48] we're this seed and we're this this and
[43:51] we're that and all of the other that's
[43:53] that's well and good but just remember
[43:56] mhm it all goes back to for knowledge
[43:59] and if you leave for
[44:01] knowledge you come out into
[44:05] predetermining and then by be
[44:08] predetermining then you're making it to
[44:10] the point that God did make something
[44:13] happen to one person or not to the other
[44:16] Etc but remember it's all for knowledge
[44:18] it doesn't matter what you think about
[44:20] this great seeds and things that
[44:22] everybody wants to talk about just
[44:25] remember there was a time that you and I
[44:28] I believe did not have eternal life amen
[44:32] all the quotes the prophet would give we
[44:34] put used them and brought them together
[44:35] to show you if you have eternal life
[44:39] eternal life always was eternal right
[44:42] and his seed remaineth in us and we
[44:44] cannot sin but yet we are sinners that's
[44:48] right amen right right cuz only
[44:51] Christians have sins the devil and his
[44:54] children are condemned already right all
[44:56] right but the seed is what remaineth in
[44:58] US that can't sin that's right all see
[45:01] now then that way then looking at it in
[45:03] a simple point then that God could look
[45:08] down through time before he created
[45:11] anything and he could see whatever
[45:14] person in the
[45:16] world would be their desires right and
[45:19] I'm glad that the prophet explained it
[45:21] to us that that even the people who do
[45:24] not hear of Jesus Christ Christ right in
[45:27] Heathen lands Etc that you know that
[45:29] it's never spoke of of Jesus Christ that
[45:32] those people are not judged according
[45:34] everybody's not judged on the same scale
[45:37] that's right thank you Lord but they'll
[45:39] be judged according to the way they
[45:40] lived according to their own laws and
[45:43] and
[45:43] doings now that's a gracious God I love
[45:46] that now see because that way it doesn't
[45:49] put that well you know all them people
[45:52] out there is going to die and go to hell
[45:54] because they didn't hear about Jesus
[45:56] well that's you know a lot of people
[45:58] will die and go to hell but it's going
[45:59] to be a lot of more of religious people
[46:01] that die and go to hell that did hear
[46:03] about Jesus then they will about those
[46:05] that didn't hear about him because God
[46:08] Is Not An unjust God right so then then
[46:12] that way we can look at
[46:14] predestination and see that God as we
[46:16] got into Romans work talking about how
[46:19] can the thing formed right right you
[46:22] know make me thus you know well God
[46:25] didn't make us wrong amen he gave us a
[46:28] choice he knew the choice we'd receive
[46:32] if he didn't he's not God right forget
[46:34] it let's go home have a good time you
[46:36] know and just live it on out you know
[46:39] but if we're going to believe in a God
[46:41] then let's believe that God knows all
[46:43] things and he knew our choices we'd make
[46:47] he knew what we would do in life you
[46:49] know and in doing all of that then he
[46:51] could predestinate it to be that way not
[46:54] make it be that that way that's our
[46:56] point of predestination we think God
[46:58] made it that way no he knew what it
[47:02] would be that's my whole driving point
[47:04] of what we've been talking about he knew
[47:07] what it would be and thereby he could
[47:11] predestinate amen amen and it would be
[47:13] to that point see it would be then by
[47:15] his for knowledge because that's the
[47:18] only way the prophet said God does is
[47:21] predestinate by his for knowledge all
[47:23] right then that way as I said you don't
[47:26] have to worry about
[47:27] it see then you can go back and you can
[47:30] read what scriptures we read and you can
[47:33] understand that you know we were
[47:35] predestinated in
[47:37] him all right now then that a way we can
[47:40] bring it down to the point that those
[47:42] who he fornew right amen he did
[47:45] predestinate amen amen see then that way
[47:49] everything as I said everything that
[47:51] happens in this
[47:53] life is predestinated by for knowledge
[47:56] it doesn't matter who it is right amen
[47:58] or else what kind of a god do you
[48:01] have predestinated because his four
[48:03] knowledge knew what we' do he knew every
[48:06] that that would ever be in the world and
[48:08] every time it would B it out how much
[48:10] Tyler the prophet said it would make
[48:13] well if he knows all of that then we
[48:14] don't have to worry about it he he knows
[48:17] all things well then that just don't
[48:20] give me a choice because if he know I
[48:22] was going to miss it I'm going to miss
[48:23] it well then that you made the choice
[48:25] right
[48:26] you done it that's right he didn't say
[48:28] that right you made the choice see so
[48:33] then we can't blame God for the choice
[48:35] we made that's right but we believe that
[48:39] he will guide us in our choice yeah
[48:42] right right amen I believe in that you
[48:44] know because he he knew see that people
[48:48] would be saved so then he could
[48:50] predestinate it all right now we got
[48:54] that part out of the way to where we can
[48:56] understand you know and really get down
[48:58] to just saying a few
[49:00] words
[49:02] now get to point now all that happens in
[49:06] an Earthly
[49:08] Journey it doesn't matter where it would
[49:10] be Russia raising up China raising up
[49:13] this country raising up that people
[49:14] raising up this happening that happening
[49:17] right God forew all
[49:20] things and that way he could write it
[49:23] down okay so we knew how many people
[49:25] people would want to be saved and who
[49:27] wouldn't want to be saved so we could
[49:29] write as the scripture says in
[49:30] Revelation 13:8 he could write our names
[49:33] down in the book or leave them out and
[49:35] it not be a respector of
[49:38] persons but would be giving everybody a
[49:42] change as I said if he will if he judges
[49:45] the people who hasn't heard the gospel
[49:49] by the way they lived according to their
[49:52] laws and their rituals and ways and
[49:54] things if if he judges them according to
[49:57] that then he does give everybody a
[50:00] change right amen that's right you said
[50:02] well I've never heard but one sermon
[50:04] well that was enough right right you had
[50:09] to change you had a
[50:11] choice all right see then we know for
[50:17] certainty that he didn't make anything
[50:21] happen right but he knew what would
[50:25] happen happen that's right and he could
[50:28] go ahead and write everything down and
[50:29] settle that at score now that should be
[50:32] enough to follow for knowledge and
[50:34] predestination about what I've tried to
[50:37] say
[50:39] because then we look at it and we say
[50:41] but now that that's fine but that's for
[50:44] everybody that's all right but we got to
[50:45] keep it for everybody right you know
[50:48] Salvation is not for everybody right but
[50:51] we got to preach it for
[50:54] everybody right
[50:56] God still no matter
[51:00] what he still came down and offered
[51:04] salvation to people right that he knew
[51:08] they were not going to receive it that's
[51:10] right now as you get that point going
[51:13] through that he he would actually come
[51:15] down right there with Judas isar for
[51:17] three and 1/2 years that's right
[51:21] yep talking with him fellowshipping with
[51:24] him every day m
[51:26] H and every day he gave him a
[51:29] change right but he made his own choice
[51:32] so don't blame God now right and say
[51:35] when now Lord you didn't give me a
[51:36] chance he give us a chance right amen
[51:39] that's right and you and I certainly
[51:40] can't say it because he's really given
[51:42] us a chance
[51:43] right see now so it's according to our
[51:46] own
[51:48] choosing yes but brother that's not that
[51:50] great predestination that that this just
[51:53] makes me that don't make me excited
[51:56] that's what I said I kept emphasizing
[51:58] one thing I said why are we afraid of
[52:00] forn
[52:03] knowledge you remember that why are we
[52:06] afraid of forn
[52:09] knowledge see we're afraid of the fact
[52:12] that we have something to do with it
[52:14] that's
[52:16] right and we can't blame somebody else
[52:19] right that's easy to do isn't it yes you
[52:23] know how we like to pie the buck you
[52:24] know iing on somebody else well it's
[52:26] their fault it's their fault do that
[52:29] makes us feel so good we went out and
[52:32] done it but it's their fault go out and
[52:34] kill somebody and say well it was their
[52:36] fault cuz they not have been there that
[52:38] day you know we've got all kind of
[52:41] excuses and ideas but it doesn't work
[52:44] does it all right but we did see there's
[52:46] one thing that we picked up in there
[52:48] that that I hope you followed the line
[52:51] of it and I'll try to say a few words
[52:53] about
[52:54] it
[52:56] we know that God before the world he had
[53:00] attributes he never gained any
[53:02] attributes coming down he only displayed
[53:05] them coming down he had always had those
[53:08] attributes he always was a savior you
[53:10] said well well they wasn't anything you
[53:12] know lost that doesn't that doesn't
[53:14] change that he was a Healer well it was
[53:17] nothing you know but see you're not
[53:20] looking at it right he he had those
[53:22] attributes within him right amen
[53:25] see and we say well it's just his
[53:28] thoughts well that's all right but
[53:31] there's deeper things to it to me than
[53:33] to just say it's just his thoughts right
[53:36] see an attribute is a part of you that's
[53:38] right right and you're you're an
[53:40] offspring of somebody so that means
[53:43] you're the attribute of somebody it's
[53:45] more than just somebody thought of you
[53:47] right but see having those attributes
[53:50] then we saw that he had an attribute in
[53:53] him was to be a father that's that's
[53:55] right
[53:56] amen all right so we easily accept the
[54:00] fact that he had an attribute to be a
[54:02] Healer so we easily want to
[54:06] express that it would mean that somewh
[54:10] something would have to come into being
[54:12] that would be sick where he could
[54:14] display his attribute
[54:16] right but what about him being a
[54:21] father you know that would mean he had
[54:23] children right
[54:27] there was a time I couldn't be called a
[54:29] father why because I didn't have any
[54:31] children you say well they was in right
[54:34] but they wouldn't out of me
[54:36] either and by myself I couldn't get them
[54:39] out of me to do any good that's right
[54:42] right but see he was a father so that
[54:47] meant what not that he wanted
[54:52] children right are you listening this
[54:55] was my point now it was not that he
[54:57] wanted children
[55:01] right cuz that could be me standing here
[55:03] and say I want children I want children
[55:06] well go get married no I'm not going to
[55:07] go get married yeah I want my children
[55:12] well you're not going to get any of that
[55:13] away
[55:15] right but it was not just that he wanted
[55:18] children he had his children right his
[55:22] children was a part of him right that's
[55:25] why we're The Offspring of
[55:27] God that's why we're not just sons of
[55:31] Jesus that was the son of God
[55:34] Amen and he wasn't a second person amen
[55:39] and neither are we a second person
[55:41] that's right we're either God made
[55:44] manifest in human flesh called a son or
[55:47] we've missed the whole
[55:49] story all right we are the children of
[55:51] God Amen which is God made manifest
[55:56] yeah all right see then doing that
[55:59] then we come over to the point of seeing
[56:02] that we talk about him being a father
[56:05] then surely we can
[56:07] see
[56:09] that it is not the person that comes
[56:12] predestinated
[56:15] eternally right that's for for knowledge
[56:17] amen that's right all but it's to seed
[56:20] our word amen amen all right I believe
[56:25] the children of God were predestinated
[56:28] eternally
[56:29] amen because they're part of God right
[56:33] amen we didn't come to
[56:37] earth now listen we come to Earth lost
[56:40] come on that's right all but we didn't
[56:43] come to Earth and in
[56:46] some roundabout way be able to uh make
[56:51] God make us his children right that's
[56:54] right no
[56:55] he knew what we'd want y That's right so
[56:58] he had it ready for
[57:00] us now but in accepting that it brought
[57:04] that eternal life
[57:07] amen that was there that we didn't get
[57:12] to come that way but we were part of him
[57:15] right remember how we brought it out
[57:17] that when he was standing there to
[57:18] create the world we had to be in him
[57:21] that's
[57:23] right if we wasn't in him then we never
[57:26] will be in him that's right so there he
[57:28] stood with all of us in him it wasn't
[57:31] Eve coming with Adam in her with Adam
[57:33] come and Eve in him see we get the story
[57:37] messed up right see Jesus Christ came
[57:41] here with us in him what how people were
[57:44] we
[57:46] people no no no what were we right the
[57:50] part of God that he was the eternal life
[57:53] amen that's right see then that way the
[57:56] the seed could come down through
[57:58] time and each age would manifest that
[58:01] seed or people right and as that people
[58:05] would receive the eternal life that
[58:08] would be that a live word for each age
[58:12] that's
[58:13] right see then being the live
[58:16] word you would see that that seed come
[58:19] predestinated eternally that's right
[58:22] that's right cuz anything Eternal have
[58:24] no beginning no ending that's right the
[58:26] eternal life you have today is a part of
[58:29] God or else it's not eternal life
[58:33] right see then once doing
[58:36] that that's word you know you think I'm
[58:40] long about doing it but see there's some
[58:42] things in there I wanted to preach on
[58:43] and I've kind of bypassed them because
[58:45] you know you can impart eternal life
[58:48] sure amen absolutely I believe in that
[58:51] am amen if you have it that's right yep
[58:55] that's the only thing I've ever tried to
[58:57] give
[58:58] away was the eternal life that God gave
[59:01] me amen you say well that's dumb I agree
[59:04] with you but you're not getting the
[59:06] point I'd love for you to have what I
[59:08] have am that's the point I'm trying to
[59:11] get and that way you can impart eternal
[59:13] life not because I go out and do it no
[59:16] because I preach the gospel that's right
[59:19] because you preach the gospel because
[59:21] you live the gospel that's right and you
[59:23] offer people around you eternal life
[59:26] amen that's right all they got to do is
[59:27] want what you got right then when they
[59:30] get what you got you just imparted
[59:32] eternal
[59:34] life well because that's true the gospel
[59:36] right see I want to preach on some of
[59:37] those things but that's all right we get
[59:39] back to
[59:40] them but we know that he chose us in him
[59:43] before the foundation of the world now
[59:46] you remember that so that if he chose us
[59:48] in him it meant we had to be in him
[59:51] right he didn't choose us to be later or
[59:55] something that's
[59:58] right the eternal life that he had we
[1:00:02] have to be a part of that eternal life
[1:00:05] right so he chose us the scripture said
[1:00:08] in
[1:00:09] him so that mean we were right there the
[1:00:12] prophet said that gives Eternal quality
[1:00:14] to the elect that's
[1:00:17] right why because we're of the same
[1:00:20] Source you remember that
[1:00:22] quote we're of the same source
[1:00:25] that's right see that's where they
[1:00:26] messed it up at NAA cuz at NAA they were
[1:00:29] trying to figure out if Jesus you know
[1:00:32] and God was the same substance or Source
[1:00:35] right and they come up with the idea now
[1:00:37] that he was the second person he wasn't
[1:00:39] the same you know Source he wasn't the
[1:00:42] same elements or say that's where they
[1:00:44] messed it right they messed it up see
[1:00:47] amen missed it there all but you see
[1:00:51] then if he's in you the eternal life
[1:00:53] that's in you
[1:00:57] you that's eternal life that's God's own
[1:01:00] life amen that's right making you and I
[1:01:03] God made manifest in human flesh right
[1:01:06] amen all right now I'm trying to get
[1:01:07] some things through and then I I'll get
[1:01:09] back to your questions and answers then
[1:01:12] we begin to talk about where the
[1:01:13] scripture
[1:01:14] says Ezekiel 18:4 that All Souls are
[1:01:20] mine see Satan cannot create that's
[1:01:23] right that's right
[1:01:25] amen he can't give you a soul right he
[1:01:28] can only
[1:01:30] pervert you he can't give you a soul see
[1:01:34] well see people will say well the soul
[1:01:36] is just the nature of the
[1:01:39] spirit all right that's not a direct
[1:01:42] quote there because when you say just
[1:01:44] that messes it up the quote is the soul
[1:01:46] is the nature of the spirit but you
[1:01:48] better remember one
[1:01:50] thing that brother Rand says like souls
[1:01:53] in prison he said the nature of your
[1:01:55] soul is God if you're born again he said
[1:01:57] if not it's of the world Amen so then
[1:02:00] Satan cannot give you a soul right so
[1:02:03] then you two Soul people and all that
[1:02:05] would have been wrong see that's but he
[1:02:07] can pervert the nature of your soul
[1:02:09] that's
[1:02:10] right see pervert us to make us go wrong
[1:02:14] all right because All Souls it doesn't
[1:02:17] matter Adolf Hitler Soul came from God
[1:02:20] right cuz Satan cannot create that's
[1:02:23] what we're going to get to this evening
[1:02:24] see is what is man
[1:02:28] right we're going to get down Dro down
[1:02:30] to earth now this evening but we trying
[1:02:32] to stay you know in up into the
[1:02:35] heavenlies and back into the eternities
[1:02:37] then we got to come down to where we're
[1:02:38] at now and start a journey through life
[1:02:42] all right but you see I
[1:02:46] believe that God created ever so amen
[1:02:50] amen but did he create them before the
[1:02:53] world and set them in little cubicle
[1:02:55] holes and then when you was needed it
[1:02:57] come out went down come out went down
[1:02:59] come out went
[1:03:03] down that's the same old thing of the
[1:03:05] two
[1:03:06] Souls the two Soul people said
[1:03:09] that God created your soul and Satan
[1:03:12] created the soul and that's why you had
[1:03:13] two
[1:03:15] souls and they was both in the same
[1:03:19] place I told him I said well if that be
[1:03:21] so then all we need to do is kill the
[1:03:23] people yeah
[1:03:25] that automatically sends you to heaven
[1:03:26] because it kill the old
[1:03:28] soul but you see people think a soul is
[1:03:31] just some
[1:03:34] nature some
[1:03:36] something but we'll get to it more this
[1:03:38] evening your soul is the real you that's
[1:03:40] right it's a whole lot more real than
[1:03:42] your body and spirit is that's right but
[1:03:45] yet we can look at it and see it but we
[1:03:47] we just can't find that Soul right we
[1:03:49] just find it as some kind of a nature of
[1:03:51] a form no it's not that it's got to be
[1:03:53] you amen but see then getting it down to
[1:03:56] it now in a
[1:03:58] hurry I believe there's only one Soul
[1:04:01] right that ever come Eternal right
[1:04:06] right I believe every individual person
[1:04:09] you know comes into the world that God
[1:04:12] breathes into our nostrils and we become
[1:04:14] a living
[1:04:16] Soul that's when he gives you that Soul
[1:04:18] he he permits it the prophet said that's
[1:04:21] right right Mom and Daddy brought your
[1:04:23] body God gave you a spirit and a soul he
[1:04:26] gave it to you perfect he didn't give it
[1:04:28] to you Eternal he gave it to you perfect
[1:04:32] right cuz God cannot create something
[1:04:35] imperfect that's right amen there's no
[1:04:38] way right where would he create it from
[1:04:41] right so that's why a baby's perfect
[1:04:44] when it comes into the world it's
[1:04:45] perfect as you look this
[1:04:48] sure but even as I told you that the way
[1:04:51] used to be and I know the world's
[1:04:52] getting so perverted now it's not right
[1:04:54] but in my day back when we was kids and
[1:04:56] all a baby born was almost immune to
[1:04:59] sicknesses for about 6 months if it was
[1:05:01] breastfed baby from his mother
[1:05:04] right cuz that was how pure the lines at
[1:05:07] least was running
[1:05:08] right but God cannot create something
[1:05:11] imperfect you said when I come a baby
[1:05:14] with one arm missing now God didn't
[1:05:16] create that
[1:05:19] right that was brought by Mom and Daddy
[1:05:22] to the process
[1:05:24] that God
[1:05:26] permitted but he didn't make it see you
[1:05:30] can't make him the author of wrong amen
[1:05:32] that's right but see then every soul
[1:05:35] that come in the world God had to God
[1:05:37] had to create that Soul
[1:05:40] amen yep and then when you're born he
[1:05:43] gives it to you oh Lord right and then
[1:05:45] you're judged according to that
[1:05:49] right all
[1:05:51] right but there's one soul that came
[1:05:53] from God Eternal amen that's right and
[1:05:56] if we Wen in Jesus Christ when he was
[1:05:58] here we never will be that's right
[1:06:01] that's right amen now I'm not talking
[1:06:03] about any his body now I'm not talking
[1:06:05] about a spirit part of us I'm talking
[1:06:07] about eternal life that's right amen cuz
[1:06:11] there's only one form of eternal life so
[1:06:14] if you have eternal life today it has to
[1:06:17] be that God gave you his own
[1:06:20] life right and his life is his being and
[1:06:23] what he is yeah I know I tried to preach
[1:06:25] that many years ago been 30 years or so
[1:06:28] ago and I'm talking about God and a soul
[1:06:31] and people said well brother Dale is
[1:06:33] saying God's got a soul I really didn't
[1:06:36] say God's got a soul I said God was a
[1:06:39] soul cuz he's a being he's a person
[1:06:42] that's
[1:06:43] right it's real to me
[1:06:46] amen and that Soul as we'll get to it
[1:06:49] later brother R said that soul went to
[1:06:51] hell y Amen to preach to those Spirits
[1:06:54] in prison right he said you and I went
[1:06:59] with him y That's
[1:07:02] right I've done been to Hell and back I
[1:07:04] don't have to worry about it right why
[1:07:07] because the one that I was in went to
[1:07:09] hell and back I don't have to go that's
[1:07:12] right he paid my price everything was
[1:07:15] taken now I wouldn't physically
[1:07:18] there right you know better than
[1:07:20] that yeah said when I brother there you
[1:07:23] made no I made the statement right we
[1:07:26] was in Jesus Christ that's right if we
[1:07:29] wasn't in Jesus Christ we never will be
[1:07:31] nowh anyway
[1:07:33] right because that's what he knew all
[1:07:35] right now get the point then there's
[1:07:38] only one Soul that's right that's
[1:07:40] Eternal amen right
[1:07:43] right there's not Souls that are Eternal
[1:07:48] right there's only one Eternal Soul
[1:07:51] right there're Souls yeah
[1:07:55] there's a world full of
[1:07:56] souls y all right that's why the
[1:08:00] scripture said All Souls are mine amen
[1:08:03] see he created
[1:08:06] them all right that's why we'll get back
[1:08:08] to more on it that's why that doesn't
[1:08:10] matter where you go in the world you
[1:08:11] find people trying to worship God why
[1:08:14] because they've got a
[1:08:18] soul but there's only one eternal life
[1:08:21] right right the only way you and I can
[1:08:24] have eternal life is for him to impart
[1:08:26] that eternal life into us that's right
[1:08:32] amen you said when I always was eternal
[1:08:34] I don't need anything
[1:08:37] well what are you talking
[1:08:41] about right what are you talking about
[1:08:43] amen you make an eternal sinner MH but
[1:08:47] you see
[1:08:48] folks I believe in the new birth I
[1:08:52] believe you must be born again
[1:08:54] I believe you come into the world me you
[1:08:56] all of us brother randam and all he's
[1:08:58] the one that said it so you argue with
[1:09:01] him he said he was born in sin shaved in
[1:09:03] iniquity went forth with his mother a
[1:09:05] liar and said doomed it on his way to
[1:09:07] hell and deserved it so now you argue
[1:09:09] with him y that's right but you see we
[1:09:13] want to make him something different no
[1:09:15] he was no if you make him any difference
[1:09:17] you got him God so you better be careful
[1:09:21] right he was different what God made him
[1:09:23] death yes right but he had to receive
[1:09:26] eternal life amen that's right and by
[1:09:30] doing that then that made his soul
[1:09:32] Eternal amen see William Brandon became
[1:09:35] Eternal amen cuz it was a time William
[1:09:38] Brandon wasn't
[1:09:40] Eternal but then he became Eternal
[1:09:42] that's right by accepting the life of
[1:09:45] God to come and live in him then that
[1:09:48] way I believe there's only one
[1:09:50] Soul that's ever come into the world
[1:09:52] that's Eternal right amen if I'm not a
[1:09:55] part of
[1:09:57] that the same way that I believe there's
[1:09:59] only one
[1:10:00] God mhm and if I'm not a part of that
[1:10:04] God y then I'm lost amen right that's
[1:10:09] right you said then brother Dale it gets
[1:10:12] confusing because these people say this
[1:10:14] and these say that I can't help
[1:10:18] that but I will quote you
[1:10:20] scripture there must needs be H sees
[1:10:23] among you that they that are approved
[1:10:26] may be made manifest you know it's put
[1:10:29] there for the purpose of the fact all of
[1:10:31] this confusion in the people of the
[1:10:33] message of what brother randam taught
[1:10:35] yeah you know or they say he taught yeah
[1:10:39] is there to try you y that's
[1:10:43] right you remember there in the Old
[1:10:47] Testament if a Prophet come and give you
[1:10:49] a
[1:10:50] sign and it come to pass
[1:10:55] that's one scripture you're supposed to
[1:10:56] believe him right right amen but there's
[1:10:59] another scripture said if a prophet
[1:11:00] comes and gives you a sign and it comes
[1:11:02] to pass and he leads you to another God
[1:11:07] another Doctrine or idea said Don't
[1:11:10] listen CA I done that to prove
[1:11:14] you that's right see we don't quote them
[1:11:18] scripture God loves to try children
[1:11:21] that's right amen he wants to see what
[1:11:23] you make out of yes you know that R
[1:11:27] around and said that God put Moses
[1:11:29] through all the trouble he went through
[1:11:30] you know why he said it have you ever
[1:11:32] read it he said because he didn't want
[1:11:34] to get down to the river
[1:11:36] Jordan or the Red Sea or wherever
[1:11:39] believe the Red Sea right he didn't want
[1:11:41] to get there and find out he had the
[1:11:43] wrong man right now that's what your
[1:11:46] Prophet had to say about that's right so
[1:11:48] he tried him over and over and over burn
[1:11:52] everything out of him after
[1:11:54] in the
[1:11:56] desert left him out there with a
[1:11:58] hotheaded woman yes the best thing could
[1:12:01] ever happened to it right that's not
[1:12:04] throwing off on women it's just a
[1:12:07] truth but he come out there the Bible
[1:12:09] said the meekest man on
[1:12:11] Earth so get on us sisters and wear us
[1:12:17] out make us
[1:12:20] Meek Danny said she does so just keep
[1:12:24] that in mind all right but do you
[1:12:27] understand what I'm saying now we'll get
[1:12:28] down to this to the questions and
[1:12:29] answers
[1:12:31] part so I
[1:12:34] believe that God paid a
[1:12:37] ransom that's right and if you'll find
[1:12:40] it this is Matthew 20 20 and 28 that God
[1:12:43] gave his life a ransom now if you go
[1:12:45] back and look at that and read just the
[1:12:47] word the words in the first part of that
[1:12:50] uh scripture it says the son of man
[1:12:53] right see God came down to give his life
[1:12:57] right now if you always was eternal what
[1:13:00] did he have to come and give his life
[1:13:02] for right what's the purpose that's
[1:13:04] right well I got the quote I know it but
[1:13:07] your quote is killing you y that's right
[1:13:10] cuz you're refusing to seek after God
[1:13:14] right you're blinding your own self but
[1:13:17] around didn't blind
[1:13:20] you it's mankind that's blinding you
[1:13:23] right
[1:13:25] we must be born again amen absolutely or
[1:13:28] else Jesus would have said to Nicodemus
[1:13:31] Nicodemus you believe the word he yet
[1:13:33] well you're born again that's you're
[1:13:35] saved you don't need nothing you always
[1:13:37] was
[1:13:40] eternal no he told him said you must be
[1:13:44] born
[1:13:47] again all right and see to receive
[1:13:50] eternal life means you die to yourself
[1:13:52] and accept his life that's right
[1:13:54] amen and his life comes in and makes
[1:13:57] your soul Eternal
[1:13:59] now that's right see I haven't got this
[1:14:02] far but I will later in the
[1:14:06] message now you're back where you should
[1:14:09] have been
[1:14:10] right amen when you receive eternal life
[1:14:15] your soul just as Eternal as it'll ever
[1:14:17] been that's right you know what that
[1:14:19] makes your soul back where it should
[1:14:20] have been to begin with prise the Lord
[1:14:22] exactly Jesus amen we should have come
[1:14:26] here with eternal
[1:14:28] life but we didn't get to because of the
[1:14:31] fall right but what's the difference see
[1:14:35] that's what people can't see they they
[1:14:37] can't understand that you could come
[1:14:39] into the world and be a mortal being and
[1:14:42] then God give that mortal being eternal
[1:14:47] life they got to come up with some
[1:14:49] devised plan that we always had it
[1:14:56] and I'm telling you you argue with me
[1:14:58] all you want to later I'm not against
[1:14:59] nobody I just tell it like it is you
[1:15:02] show me one of them
[1:15:06] doctrines and I'll show you every one of
[1:15:08] them went to the bed of adultery I'm
[1:15:10] talking about physical adulteries that's
[1:15:14] right now you name one of them that's
[1:15:18] right they went to physical adulteries
[1:15:21] polygamy and times
[1:15:24] would you tell me that's where you want
[1:15:25] to
[1:15:30] go all right see that was that Spirit on
[1:15:33] them that wouldn't accept the truth
[1:15:35] right that's
[1:15:37] right amen so then they go after the
[1:15:39] lies of the devil all right but you see
[1:15:42] Satan has tried his best to get us to
[1:15:45] see that he's God right that's what he
[1:15:48] wants us to believe right and if we
[1:15:50] accept his lie then we're making him God
[1:15:52] y right
[1:15:54] amen but you see we must receive eternal
[1:15:57] life but once we receive eternal life
[1:16:00] that eternal life is just as Eternal as
[1:16:02] God ever was because it's God's own
[1:16:05] life that's
[1:16:08] right all right then that's the soul
[1:16:10] that come from God
[1:16:14] Amen All Souls come by
[1:16:19] creation but God's children come into
[1:16:22] the world
[1:16:24] with a
[1:16:26] predestinated seed yes I believe that
[1:16:29] but is it a spot down in you what is
[1:16:33] it is there a little grain running
[1:16:35] around in the inch square compartment
[1:16:37] that the S says the bo of the
[1:16:42] Soul or is it just like I said when God
[1:16:45] said he created All
[1:16:48] Souls and that was before the foundation
[1:16:51] of the world in his mind that's right
[1:16:53] yes amen but did he make cubicles and
[1:16:55] set them up wait here it comes there it
[1:16:58] come it come cuz that's what your two
[1:16:59] Soul people said right and this is their
[1:17:03] doctorine I'm not throwing off I'm just
[1:17:04] telling you what it was to see maybe
[1:17:06] where we get caught into
[1:17:09] it the two Soul people taught it like
[1:17:11] this I know the man listened to it he
[1:17:14] said here it was baby fixing to be born

[1:18:39] is accepted pardon not a pardon let
[1:18:41] received is one right
[1:18:43] right but Brother D I believe all them
[1:18:45] quotes where the Prophet said always was
[1:18:47] eternal as I said keep
[1:18:49] reading the one you're talking about
[1:18:52] there's only one one that really comes
[1:18:53] down to where you wouldn't saved on no
[1:18:55] certain day is in uh future home I
[1:18:58] believe it's right but anyhow I keep
[1:19:00] reading the book I gave it to you that's
[1:19:02] right where he goes on over in the
[1:19:03] message and he said if you if you have
[1:19:05] eternal life you always was eternal
[1:19:07] right if you have eternal life remember
[1:19:09] I spent about three services on if you
[1:19:12] have eternal life right that's right if
[1:19:15] you have eternal life that means eternal
[1:19:17] life always was eternal that's right
[1:19:20] that's right and even showing you that
[1:19:22] there'll be a full virgin people one day
[1:19:24] get eternal life right that's right
[1:19:27] people will be given eternal life at the
[1:19:29] white Throne judgment
[1:19:32] true well do they have it
[1:19:36] now
[1:19:38] right no but brother I'm different yeah

[1:19:45] to it's going to be over with pretty
[1:19:48] quick right and then you going to find
[1:19:50] out that's right but you see I believe
[1:19:52] this 40 years ago and I believe it right
[1:19:53] now you must be born again that's right
[1:19:57] you must receive eternal life you know
[1:20:00] why I believe it cuz I received
[1:20:03] it I can talk about it cuz I received
[1:20:08] it right I wouldn't that I just come in
[1:20:11] the message I told you about it I was in
[1:20:13] the message two years before I received
[1:20:14] the new
[1:20:15] birth reading six books a day and
[1:20:18] listening to two
[1:20:20] tapes brother even told me when well you
[1:20:23] believe the message didn't you I said
[1:20:26] yeah but Paul said have you receed the
[1:20:28] gift of the Holy Ghost since you believe
[1:20:30] the
[1:20:31] message I say that to you and I right
[1:20:33] here today make sure that your calling
[1:20:36] an election is
[1:20:38] Right I'd still rather be seeking God
[1:20:41] that's good old Baptist you know no if I
[1:20:44] seek God that means I'm saying I don't
[1:20:46] have
[1:20:49] it I'd rather be seeking God and find
[1:20:51] out I've all had it all
[1:20:54] along let me quote brother random didn't
[1:20:56] the man that picked up the track and
[1:20:58] walked and went everywhere went to
[1:21:00] different places and different ones you
[1:21:02] need that quote when he come into the
[1:21:05] presence of brother Ram what did he
[1:21:08] say brother R told him said you had it
[1:21:10] all the time said you right there when
[1:21:11] you picked that track up yeah right he
[1:21:14] said you mean I've had it all alone he
[1:21:16] said
[1:21:17] yeah well you know
[1:21:20] what I believe brother R was right amen
[1:21:23] but I believe that man was seeking after
[1:21:24] God you know what God is looking at that
[1:21:26] man's
[1:21:28] desires
[1:21:30] right see church that's what it's based
[1:21:33] on eternal
[1:21:35] life
[1:21:37] amen must be
[1:21:40] received then it always was
[1:21:43] eternal always was eternal amen don't
[1:21:47] have to have no beginning and no ending
[1:21:49] to it it always was eternal right amen
[1:21:52] see I always was a child of God
[1:21:57] Amen but I certainly was lost yes that's
[1:22:02] right brother R said I found out that I
[1:22:03] wasn't the son of Charles and
[1:22:07] brown now what's he talking about he
[1:22:10] wasn't denying his mother and daddy
[1:22:12] that's right he was in the spiritual
[1:22:14] extent right that's right am
[1:22:20] y see that's where we got to
[1:22:23] trouble we'll get back to it this
[1:22:25] evening what is man and we'll see what's
[1:22:27] wrong with us where the problem is at
[1:22:29] and then we'll start from there and go
[1:22:31] back up through this Plan of
[1:22:35] Redemption because I believe we must be
[1:22:38] redeemed amen that's right I showed you
[1:22:40] there that your body where was it at
[1:22:42] Prophet said it was in the world when it
[1:22:45] was
[1:22:46] created all right so when Jesus red with
[1:22:49] there on the River Jordan what happens
[1:22:51] he this is my beloved Son in whom I'm
[1:22:52] pleased to dwell
[1:22:54] Y what did brother runet said this is my
[1:22:57] part of the earth that I redeemed and
[1:22:59] from this part of the earth I'll redeem
[1:23:00] the rest of
[1:23:02] it you know that we step ahead by the
[1:23:05] change of the body by the Redemption of
[1:23:07] this body we step ahead of the world cuz
[1:23:09] it's going to be at least another
[1:23:10] thousand years and then two short
[1:23:12] seasons in
[1:23:13] there that before the world is made
[1:23:16] Eternal but our bodies have stepped
[1:23:18] right out you know what the world's got
[1:23:19] to follow
[1:23:21] us it's got to follow us why because
[1:23:25] we're
[1:23:26] Eternal not going to blow it away and
[1:23:28] annihilate
[1:23:31] it but see we had all them
[1:23:35] doctrines now I'm going to say this and
[1:23:37] then I I'll get down the other you know
[1:23:39] I thought that we
[1:23:43] believed and I know this is going to go
[1:23:45] over real good but I thought we believe
[1:23:48] when brother brand said with the
[1:23:50] restoration of the word would come to
[1:23:53] Restoration of
[1:23:57] power you know what I say the problem of
[1:24:01] the people is the power reason the power
[1:24:03] is not in you and my the way it needs to
[1:24:06] be is because we don't believe it
[1:24:08] right that's right that's right but that
[1:24:11] don't change a thing that's right
[1:24:13] because with the restoration of the word
[1:24:15] God's got to keep his
[1:24:17] word that's
[1:24:19] right and the power of God is here it's
[1:24:22] just up to you and I to release it amen
[1:24:26] right well brother Dale there's plenty
[1:24:28] of sick among us right there must be
[1:24:29] sick among
[1:24:32] us oh my hey folks I keep saying it and
[1:24:35] you don't like it but we're getting
[1:24:36] older and with the older you get the
[1:24:39] sickness comes that's right then people
[1:24:42] say Well it don't have to no it don't
[1:24:44] but it does
[1:24:48] right and I don't want to stay in this
[1:24:51] pest house right that's right I'm
[1:24:54] beginning to get to the point that I'm
[1:24:55] sick of this old
[1:24:57] boy right but you see with the restation
[1:25:00] of the word but now you tell me if we
[1:25:03] haven't preached the word correctly how
[1:25:05] can you expect the power to come right
[1:25:10] amen so now if we don't understand
[1:25:13] predestination if we don't understand
[1:25:15] eternal life if we don't understand all
[1:25:18] of these things I've been talking about
[1:25:20] lately it must be showing the fact that
[1:25:22] we don't believe God's word or else
[1:25:24] brother Dale was wrong I've got enough
[1:25:27] sense to be able to figure that out
[1:25:29] right I may be 70 W be 71 just in a few
[1:25:33] days but I got enough sense to figure it
[1:25:37] out that if I haven't preached it
[1:25:40] correctly God's not
[1:25:41] underbound that's right but if I have he
[1:25:44] ain't underbound to me cuz it wasn't me
[1:25:48] that done it right he's underbound to
[1:25:50] what he said in his word
[1:25:54] it's up to you and I to believe it yes
[1:25:56] amen that's right well I want to see now
[1:25:59] you can't see to believe you got to
[1:26:01] believe to
[1:26:03] see if I could just get better I would I
[1:26:07] confess I'm
[1:26:09] Healed I I I'd say that i' healed if I
[1:26:12] just got better now that's no scripture
[1:26:15] for
[1:26:16] that that's right you're in a lie of the
[1:26:18] devil
[1:26:21] right same thing for
[1:26:25] salvation yes but I don't want to lie
[1:26:27] Brother D if I go around saying I'm
[1:26:29] saved and I ain't saved
[1:26:32] yeah well who said you
[1:26:39] wasn't I don't want to be AE about you
[1:26:42] know fact that that here I am I'm still
[1:26:46] sick what's that got to do with God's
[1:26:49] word right he said I'm Healed right amen
[1:26:52] let me say what he said like I said the
[1:26:55] other day was somebody about about the
[1:26:56] blind man you know brother R told him
[1:26:59] said you're
[1:27:01] healed he went off and he come back a
[1:27:04] day or two later come back sometime
[1:27:05] later the brother R him you know and he
[1:27:07] said I can't see you told me that I was
[1:27:11] healed he said
[1:27:14] now are you going to say what God
[1:27:17] says God says you're healed right you go
[1:27:21] say God
[1:27:23] what God said man standing out on the
[1:27:25] street and everybody laughing making fun
[1:27:27] of him right
[1:27:29] right extra extra Read All About It by
[1:27:32] Stripes I'm Healed I can
[1:27:34] see well you're just as blind today as
[1:27:37] you was yesterday you're making a
[1:27:40] mockery out of the Gospel but one day he
[1:27:43] was sitting in a barber's chair and the
[1:27:46] barber was making fun of him you know
[1:27:47] and said I thought you said you healed
[1:27:49] he said I am I can see and his eyes come
[1:27:51] open yeah well now what if he hadn't
[1:27:54] kept saying
[1:27:55] that that's right you know what he
[1:27:57] stayed blind till he
[1:27:59] died y but when he confessed it he just
[1:28:02] kept kept on confessing it well what's
[1:28:04] wrong with saying it one more
[1:28:08] time what's wrong with saying it one
[1:28:10] more time I'm
[1:28:11] Healed that's
[1:28:14] right but see that Old Devil come up you
[1:28:16] don't want to lie Satan you're the
[1:28:20] liar God said I'm
[1:28:23] Healed God says I'm saved let me go say
[1:28:26] I'm saved then Y what is what scripture
[1:28:29] say about let the redeem say so or
[1:28:31] something like
[1:28:32] that let's say What God
[1:28:37] Says then it's his
[1:28:39] responsibility that's right but like I
[1:28:42] told a brother the other day the
[1:28:43] scripture says you know repent every one
[1:28:44] of you and be baptized in the name of
[1:28:46] Jesus Christ for remission to sin and
[1:28:47] you shall receive the gift of the Holy
[1:28:48] Ghost but you know I never read there
[1:28:50] where it said when I was going to get it
[1:28:53] right have
[1:28:54] you have you ever read there the next
[1:28:57] verse does it say when you going to get
[1:29:01] it no it's when God wants you to have
[1:29:05] it but you got to say you got
[1:29:08] it that you're
[1:29:10] healed what happens when you call
[1:29:13] me all right somebody want to answer
[1:29:16] that one how you doing brother
[1:29:19] Dale wonderful
[1:29:26] wonderful well you mean you're not hurt
[1:29:28] I didn't say
[1:29:30] that I said I
[1:29:34] healed well I'm not going to say that
[1:29:37] brother cuz I'm just no I'm not feeling
[1:29:39] too good but let's keep your sickness
[1:29:41] that's right cuz you
[1:29:44] will cuz God can't do anything for you
[1:29:47] that's right and he can't save you if
[1:29:49] you don't confess it all right okay
[1:29:52] let's get on questions and answers I got
[1:29:53] a few written down we'll cover that and
[1:29:55] then we'll go from that so everybody get
[1:29:58] ready
[1:30:00] okay said did God dictate the
[1:30:04] descendants of those who chose not to be
[1:30:06] saved in other words did he set make
[1:30:09] Point dictates you know it determine all
[1:30:12] right
[1:30:16] now I know the quote but I know what's
[1:30:19] being used that brother R said he had to
[1:30:21] breed this one to this one to that and
[1:30:22] to this one that and to get you here I I
[1:30:24] agree with that that's
[1:30:26] right but now did he put it together
[1:30:30] through adultery and
[1:30:33] thing right
[1:30:38] you you see what I'm saying so did God
[1:30:42] dictate a lot of it or was it God's forn
[1:30:44] knowledge that would take place he
[1:30:46] didn't make it happen right it was his
[1:30:49] forn knowledge that so and so would be
[1:30:50] bred to so and so so and so would be BR
[1:30:53] to so and so to get you here y it would
[1:30:56] be his for knowledge more than he had to
[1:30:58] make this and do and run this over here
[1:30:59] and do see because you you truly can't
[1:31:02] say it about
[1:31:05] everybody I believe it's just plain out
[1:31:07] to the bases I'm just answering the best
[1:31:08] I can that it was necessary for them
[1:31:12] people to be back there that rejected
[1:31:14] Moses for them people to be standing
[1:31:16] there right you know with the Lord Jesus
[1:31:19] I agree amen but be careful how you're
[1:31:22] trying to make it when you say in the
[1:31:24] dictat see because that means that
[1:31:25] you're you're making it come that way
[1:31:27] that's right I I'd rather just put it to
[1:31:29] the bases that we got
[1:31:32] here say the person went on to say
[1:31:35] because he knew whatever person would
[1:31:36] look like or did he do that only for
[1:31:39] those who are literally part of him you
[1:31:43] so you could divide that it's all right
[1:31:46] you could say that he would choose and
[1:31:48] bring to make sure you got here
[1:31:50] correctly but still still don't put it
[1:31:52] on the basis of of choosing it as much
[1:31:55] as that he knew what would take
[1:31:58] place that's I'd rather approach it from
[1:32:00] him knowing it than for him to make it
[1:32:04] happen as we would try to read the quote
[1:32:07] and say that it's got to be this
[1:32:09] way I don't believe brother ROM a lot of
[1:32:12] time is saying things that's got to be
[1:32:14] this way right he saying what took place
[1:32:17] amen see so I I'd rather just leave it
[1:32:20] on that see and and that way you don't
[1:32:22] have to worry about it because then you
[1:32:23] don't get concerned with what has
[1:32:25] happened and that happened right thank
[1:32:27] God I got here right I thank God that my
[1:32:31] mom and daddy didn't believe in birth
[1:32:34] control no abortion no
[1:32:37] abortion cuz I'm the baby of
[1:32:40] 13 Y and I'm sure thank God they didn't
[1:32:44] believe in it yep cuz I might not have
[1:32:47] got here you
[1:32:49] know but you see you know I thank God I
[1:32:52] got here amen all right and if I'm the
[1:32:56] only one out of the 13 that would
[1:32:57] believe the message I thank God for that
[1:33:00] am right how he got me here thank God he
[1:33:05] did right he sure did all
[1:33:08] right when God created man in Genesis
[1:33:13] 1:26 was this why he said All Souls are
[1:33:18] mine then the one on said I've heard it
[1:33:20] was the the bride only okay now it
[1:33:24] wasn't that when he created man right
[1:33:29] you know in Genesis 126 I I don't
[1:33:32] believe Genesis 126 was all the souls
[1:33:35] that was ever created I'll get to that
[1:33:37] later I don't believe that I believe
[1:33:39] that was the soul of God Amen that's
[1:33:41] right right because it's the the Eternal
[1:33:45] God right amen all it's the one brother
[1:33:47] R we'll cover later so I believe that
[1:33:49] when Genesis 1 126 was made that is that
[1:33:52] one soul I talking about while ago
[1:33:54] that's
[1:33:55] right that's when he said made man see
[1:34:00] all right see one man right and that's
[1:34:06] the Lord Jesus Christ amen that's right
[1:34:09] and from there is where we're
[1:34:11] at but as far as all the rest see then
[1:34:15] that Souls that God created
[1:34:18] yeah he created everybody's Soul see put
[1:34:21] in there I heard it was the bride only I
[1:34:23] believe that I believe that Genesis 1:26
[1:34:25] and 27 is only the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:34:28] that's right yes sir you know every how
[1:34:30] you want to say that the bride
[1:34:32] because you got to tie in together those
[1:34:34] of the Old Testament that eventually
[1:34:36] come to it but just to put it to where
[1:34:38] we're at we'll hold it to the to the
[1:34:39] bride all right and then they went on to
[1:34:41] say he told them to to multiply and
[1:34:44] replenish the
[1:34:45] Earth he told him the same way as he did
[1:34:48] with
[1:34:49] Noah but now remember Genesis 126 and 27
[1:34:54] is a spiritual creation right all right
[1:34:58] now so then that would be spiritual
[1:35:00] multiplication right amen correct the
[1:35:03] replenish word it says there in Genesis
[1:35:05] 12627 all to go and replenish the Earth
[1:35:08] it didn't mean to go out and fill the
[1:35:10] Earth with bodies that's
[1:35:13] right
[1:35:15] right it meant to go out
[1:35:18] and spiritually what are we doing today
[1:35:21] what was we talking about while ago
[1:35:22] that's right how are we imparting
[1:35:24] eternal life that's right how do you
[1:35:27] impart eternal life amen you raise your
[1:35:30] children in the correct way you teach
[1:35:32] them about God you give them a choice no
[1:35:35] I want to give them a choice to do what
[1:35:37] you want to don't give them a choice to
[1:35:38] do what they want to going to die and go
[1:35:39] to hell right that's right give them a
[1:35:42] choice to accept Jesus Christ right yeah
[1:35:46] but that's making them no that ain't
[1:35:47] making them it's laying it out in front
[1:35:49] of them letting them make the choice all
[1:35:52] right see so then to me now when it says
[1:35:54] in Genesis 126 and 27 they're about
[1:35:58] multiply and replenish that's not
[1:35:59] talking about physical bodies cuz
[1:36:00] there's no physical bodies di no that's
[1:36:03] right amen that's Genesis 1 that's a
[1:36:05] spiritual creation right Genesis 2 is
[1:36:07] the physical
[1:36:09] creation see then Noah was told to
[1:36:11] replenish the Earth because it was only
[1:36:13] the children of Noah and you know and
[1:36:15] his family and thing and see that would
[1:36:17] be where it would come down so then you
[1:36:19] got to divide the two amen one of is
[1:36:21] speaking of a physical creation you know
[1:36:24] physical replenishing MH or to bring
[1:36:26] forth again cu the original there see it
[1:36:28] says in replenishing people believe that
[1:36:31] that that meant there was people
[1:36:34] before right you know or some other
[1:36:37] civilization but it really doesn't mean
[1:36:39] that if you look original up it just
[1:36:41] means to feel or to stalk right it
[1:36:45] doesn't mean it's got to
[1:36:48] replenish because that would make
[1:36:50] something before
[1:36:52] it's not saying that it's talking about
[1:36:53] just a stocking of it all right now when
[1:36:56] I get through you can have any comments
[1:36:58] you want to on these but I'll just
[1:36:59] covering what what I
[1:37:02] got do you think the souls under the
[1:37:06] altar are breathing
[1:37:09] beings
[1:37:12] yeah I don't believe they're breathing
[1:37:14] beings like human beings are
[1:37:18] breathing because sold under the altar
[1:37:21] would you know let's take it away from
[1:37:23] one point let's don't have the Jews and
[1:37:25] the things sold under the altar cuz
[1:37:27] we'll get back to it brother brandom
[1:37:28] used it and the the angel of the Lord
[1:37:30] that with brother Brandon beyond the
[1:37:31] curtain of time said this is the
[1:37:33] scripture Souls under the altar right
[1:37:35] but now if you say how long how long
[1:37:37] that's Revelations over there you know
[1:37:40] the Jews to avenge our blood now you
[1:37:43] can't use it that way see so you're
[1:37:46] going to have to you have to divide that
[1:37:47] scripture right cuz if you use it to you
[1:37:50] know soul Under The Altar and just leave
[1:37:52] it everything no but Souls under the
[1:37:54] altar those beyond the curtain of time
[1:37:57] do you call them breathing beings or do
[1:37:59] you call them
[1:38:02] beings that are above breathing above
[1:38:05] all that brother BR said a hand greater
[1:38:07] than our hand an eye greater than your
[1:38:09] eye
[1:38:10] see it's a body yeah yes sir but it's
[1:38:15] not just say a breathing being because
[1:38:18] when you references the breathing beings
[1:38:20] you're talking about natural physical
[1:38:23] life right because in the other realm
[1:38:26] you wouldn't be saying well Breathe In
[1:38:28] Breathe Out breathe in breathe out you
[1:38:30] know no because it's so much more higher
[1:38:33] above
[1:38:35] that when we get to heaven we won't have
[1:38:37] to worry about breathing our brain won't
[1:38:39] have to tell our heart to
[1:38:43] beat it won't have to tell you to
[1:38:45] breathe something has to control you now
[1:38:48] so breathing being to me is referring to
[1:38:50] here
[1:38:52] they're not up there breathing cuz you
[1:38:54] don't have to breathe in that other
[1:38:59] dimension you know you say well they are
[1:39:02] breathing and then we'd have to Define
[1:39:04] what you mean
[1:39:05] breathing because I don't believe that
[1:39:07] you're having to stand
[1:39:09] out you know that's the reference to me
[1:39:13] of breathing you know it's so much
[1:39:16] higher until there's nowhere in the
[1:39:18] world they went on to say God didn't
[1:39:20] breathe into Adam until they became
[1:39:23] flesh well that's
[1:39:25] true God didn't breathe into Adam until
[1:39:28] the flesh was there
[1:39:31] right he didn't breathe into him
[1:39:33] somewhere else and he become he breathed
[1:39:35] into him after the flesh was brought
[1:39:37] then he became a living soul and was
[1:39:40] breathed the breath of eternal life into
[1:39:42] Adam right see so then your breathing
[1:39:44] would be more or less here all right so
[1:39:47] then one on the person went on to say
[1:39:49] part two of it was well they they become
[1:39:51] glorified flesh when we do for we're
[1:39:55] caught up together to meet him now
[1:39:58] everybody's not going up when we go up
[1:40:00] right right that's not it the Old
[1:40:03] Testament Saints are not going up when
[1:40:05] we go up in the Rapture the uh foolish
[1:40:08] virgins the people that will be given
[1:40:10] eternal life in the second Resurrection
[1:40:12] see that they will not be not will be
[1:40:15] they won't be glorified when we go up
[1:40:17] right see because that's that's not the
[1:40:20] point I'm just read reading the question
[1:40:21] like it says will they become glorified
[1:40:23] flesh when we do all right if that's
[1:40:27] talking about those beyond the curtain
[1:40:28] of time right you know as to to souls
[1:40:32] under the altar we sure we'll all go up
[1:40:35] together right all of us is going up
[1:40:38] together doesn't matter what age you're
[1:40:39] in you know whatever as long as you're
[1:40:41] ining new birth but it won't be
[1:40:43] everybody doesn't go up at the same time
[1:40:45] right you got a difference in in the
[1:40:48] going up time of it you know and all all
[1:40:51] right now could it be Adam's birth types
[1:40:54] Jesus's birth well that's all right I
[1:40:56] agree with that that's that's a good
[1:40:58] point that you know Adam's birth showing
[1:41:01] that Adam you know come into the world
[1:41:05] and God gave him eternal life showing
[1:41:07] that Jesus was born into the world and
[1:41:09] God breathed the breath of life into his
[1:41:10] nostrils I believe that right I don't
[1:41:13] believe that when he was in the womb
[1:41:15] that he was was you know the eternal
[1:41:17] life was there the soul was there I
[1:41:19] don't I believe it was when he come
[1:41:21] forth see and that's why brother random
[1:41:24] I love that that when he says you know
[1:41:27] that a baby is wiggling
[1:41:31] muscles he said but it's not a soul
[1:41:33] until it's born into the world and
[1:41:35] breathe that breath life I heard one the
[1:41:36] other day that and I looked at it again
[1:41:39] this morning I still want to try it but
[1:41:41] not doubting what he said and he's
[1:41:43] describing how that a child in the wound
[1:41:46] or an animal see an animal's in the
[1:41:48] wound it's the same way right but it's
[1:41:51] not a living Soul right but he said it's
[1:41:54] just like a horse High you put it in the
[1:41:55] water and it'll curl
[1:41:57] up any of you horse guys know anything
[1:42:00] about that that's what he said he said
[1:42:02] you put a horse in the water instead
[1:42:04] it'll wiggle
[1:42:06] around I didn't know that I know that
[1:42:08] frog legs will keep
[1:42:11] kicking but that's jerking muscles
[1:42:14] that's what it was I just happened to
[1:42:15] see that I better find out about this
[1:42:18] cuz he said you like a hire you put in
[1:42:19] the water and it'll move
[1:42:22] but see I believe the birth of the baby
[1:42:26] you know when God breathes into the
[1:42:28] nostrils of that baby it becomes a
[1:42:30] living
[1:42:31] Soul cuz it's not a living Soul while
[1:42:33] it's in the wom right right you can say
[1:42:37] well it's got Wiggly muscles it can feel
[1:42:38] pain it's all right so to animals
[1:42:43] right no difference in that part so to
[1:42:45] animals amen and I don't believe in
[1:42:47] abortion no sure around right don't
[1:42:50] agree agree with it amen but I believe
[1:42:53] there's cases where that it's better
[1:42:55] to you know take the child and it is to
[1:42:59] let it be born right right I agree with
[1:43:01] that now sure amen because that's you've
[1:43:04] got to have it in the right way that's
[1:43:06] why I'm glad brother random explain that
[1:43:07] that's right yes sir so you can say to
[1:43:10] somebody at the then well now you took
[1:43:11] that baby's life no you didn't take the
[1:43:13] baby's
[1:43:14] life cuz it wasn't live yet right I'm
[1:43:18] glad we had a prophet amen you that just
[1:43:21] that that's my thrill and is to know the
[1:43:23] truth Y and like I said while ago though
[1:43:25] if we don't search the message
[1:43:28] out then then it's our fa problem we got
[1:43:32] the message we got the computers we can
[1:43:34] search anything brother around and say
[1:43:35] it now that's right just an instant to
[1:43:38] search it out to see what he said about
[1:43:41] something thank God for all those things
[1:43:43] all
[1:43:47] now said could it be Adam's birth top
[1:43:50] Jesus's birth said he received eternal
[1:43:53] life and Jesus being God was eternal at
[1:43:55] his first breath let see I agree with
[1:44:00] that see this is different in the
[1:44:03] natural the breath gives the the
[1:44:06] breath gives the body now this is what
[1:44:09] the person St the breath gives the body
[1:44:11] life but the soul needs to be
[1:44:14] reborn through the word it byass I agree
[1:44:19] you know if you're listening to what
[1:44:20] said then see in the natural God gives
[1:44:23] breath to the child and that brings life
[1:44:25] to the body right but then we must have
[1:44:28] the new birth see and if we don't have
[1:44:30] that we've missed it all right and see
[1:44:32] then went on to say we're we have to be
[1:44:35] a full age like Adam was to understand
[1:44:38] the word that makes us glorified I agree
[1:44:41] that's that's what we have to see you
[1:44:44] can't reason with a baby I like
[1:44:48] that I guess that's why he made man
[1:44:50] first not a baby
[1:44:52] first you know the old
[1:44:54] argu the chicken or the egg you know
[1:44:57] they've argued and argu over on or now
[1:45:00] he made the chicken amen sure
[1:45:02] did he didn't make the egg and let it
[1:45:05] hatch he made the
[1:45:07] chicken you can't you can't reason with
[1:45:10] a baby that's they don't have reasoning
[1:45:12] factors that way they'll argue with you
[1:45:14] so will babies in Christ even argue with
[1:45:17] you you know and it's hard to deal with
[1:45:19] them because they'll argue with you
[1:45:21] about the point all right let me get one
[1:45:22] more then
[1:45:25] right says my body was never
[1:45:29] back in or with
[1:45:32] God but must be redeemed I agree I
[1:45:35] preached that part in there right I
[1:45:38] believe your body was in the earth yep
[1:45:41] but if you're going to have one to live
[1:45:42] in you're going to have to redeem it
[1:45:44] right we're not going to get a new one
[1:45:46] right and then the message people they
[1:45:49] still believe you're going to get a new
[1:45:50] body there's a lot of people believe
[1:45:51] that but I don't believe it I I just
[1:45:53] can't handle that I believe that you
[1:45:56] know Jesus's body come up with nail
[1:45:58] prints in it and I believe he'll have
[1:46:00] nail prints in it when we get there
[1:46:02] right CU it's the same body right you
[1:46:05] see to to me my body was back there in
[1:46:08] his for
[1:46:10] knowledge of my partaking of the
[1:46:12] revealed word that I bypass and becoming
[1:46:15] glorified that's that's good you
[1:46:18] know in his for knowledge he knew knew
[1:46:20] my body was coming so brother R said he
[1:46:22] put it in the
[1:46:23] Earth but he didn't put it this on what
[1:46:26] did he put in the earth and I like the
[1:46:28] way brother Brown says it even that our
[1:46:30] body is being this body
[1:46:32] redeemed I like the way he says it like
[1:46:35] I've always
[1:46:36] Illustrated what if you were in Africa
[1:46:39] and a line eat you up and they grab him
[1:46:41] real quick and they put him on a plane
[1:46:42] and they fly him to
[1:46:44] California and he goes and uses the
[1:46:46] restroom where's your
[1:46:49] body that's Carn oil but where's your
[1:46:51] body so brother R said not necessarily
[1:46:54] the same gases
[1:46:57] gases
[1:46:59] right see God don't have to bring all
[1:47:01] the same gases you know people do that
[1:47:03] and they'll put a cross somewhere and
[1:47:05] they'll put a sign somewhere somebody
[1:47:07] died here and all of that but you know
[1:47:10] over
[1:47:11] time the bulldozer is going to move that
[1:47:15] dirt somewhere else and where are you so
[1:47:19] it's not necessary the same gases he
[1:47:21] said but it's the same body absolutely
[1:47:25] amen you're going to stand in the same
[1:47:27] body you even The Sinner is going to
[1:47:28] stand in the same body he sinned in now
[1:47:31] I don't believe his body is going to
[1:47:32] come up 18 years old that's just a
[1:47:34] personal opinion I don't believe a
[1:47:35] sinner's coming up 18 years old and be
[1:47:37] judge I don't believe
[1:47:39] that but I believe you and
[1:47:42] I our bodies going to have to come back
[1:47:45] young again that's
[1:47:47] right so we're going to raise 18 years
[1:47:50] old or
[1:47:51] something but it's going to be in a
[1:47:52] glorified body amen this body made
[1:47:56] Eternal amen see and went on to say my
[1:47:59] body is redeemed to what he saw it at
[1:48:02] the final end of his
[1:48:05] plan he said because there's no time in
[1:48:07] God and I don't go back in body but
[1:48:11] manifest my part of his family right
[1:48:13] here I agree with that I believe that
[1:48:15] amen all right so we got D now anybody
[1:48:17] else somebody else got something we got
[1:48:19] a few minutes we can go
[1:48:20] we don't we pick it up this
[1:48:22] evening anybody got a comment or thought
[1:48:25] or want to
[1:48:27] question I'd like to say something about
[1:48:29] your body all right hold on just a
[1:48:31] minute let me let me get rid of
[1:48:37] this told somebody a while ago I Tred to
[1:48:40] keep my mouth shut that just you showed
[1:48:43] up
[1:48:46] toight uh you know I I deal with people
[1:48:49] it it's about every
[1:48:51] day and for some you you know we were we
[1:48:55] were T it was Apple on the
[1:48:57] tree and uh that's what somebody said
[1:49:01] that's not what it was but that'll be
[1:49:04] with
[1:49:05] us till the
[1:49:08] end and you know people say well flesh
[1:49:11] and blood won't inherit right no it
[1:49:14] don't inherit just goes along mhm but
[1:49:17] you know that and you might not like
[1:49:20] your body and what have you like that
[1:49:23] but you can't manifest the Lord Jesus
[1:49:26] Christ without a body Flesh and Blood
[1:49:29] exactly right
[1:49:33] exactly so that's that's what he put us
[1:49:35] here for that's mine you know and the
[1:49:39] the body is for the journey the body's
[1:49:41] for the
[1:49:44] ride we got to have one to live in I had
[1:49:47] a guy asked me the other day he says you
[1:49:49] mean and he done this you know this body
[1:49:53] this dust this going back to d i says I
[1:49:55] don't know you know but it's going to be
[1:49:58] your body
[1:50:00] mhm see people you know and it's it's
[1:50:03] it's a it's a Doctrine from way back
[1:50:08] they've been told just like you take the
[1:50:11] hell is
[1:50:12] eternal well see that's that's a
[1:50:15] Doctrine from way back right but when
[1:50:17] you find out that you have to be born
[1:50:19] again
[1:50:22] to be in Hell Eternal or in eternal
[1:50:25] hell or you know go the The Eternal has
[1:50:28] to be there right then that you know
[1:50:32] just logic right but uh I just I just
[1:50:36] want to say that about about the
[1:50:40] body I believe in the Redemption of the
[1:50:43] body right Jesus's body wasn't Eternal
[1:50:47] no it was created but one day it became
[1:50:50] Eternal
[1:50:51] right well then what's the problem with
[1:50:54] us we don't have to get a new
[1:50:56] one
[1:50:58] right want get a new one who else you
[1:51:01] going to look like I like
[1:51:04] myself I've pred him for 70 years now
[1:51:07] you know calming it and brushing it I
[1:51:09] don't want to get rid of I like the old
[1:51:12] dog who's
[1:51:17] next that's where I've always used next
[1:51:20] I've always said it wouldn't matter to
[1:51:23] me you know and I I I mean this and you
[1:51:25] know it cuz you know the way I talk play
[1:51:28] it wouldn't matter to me if I was black
[1:51:29] as
[1:51:30] s or as yellow as could
[1:51:34] be or whatever it
[1:51:38] is I thank
[1:51:40] God that he allowed me to
[1:51:43] live and allowed me to hear the truth y
[1:51:47] That's right to be able to accept it
[1:51:50] right you think about it sometimes what
[1:51:52] he had to do now even in the natural I
[1:51:56] mean we have a lot of people sitting
[1:51:59] here that was from different countries
[1:52:02] and even a lot of you was from different
[1:52:03] countries that didn't know you come from
[1:52:05] different countries
[1:52:08] did but you know look at at what it took
[1:52:12] for to bring us here that's
[1:52:14] right that gets me that's right amen
[1:52:18] then all this could happened we could
[1:52:20] hear and believe God's word that's right
[1:52:23] right exactly right from all over the
[1:52:28] world that we could come
[1:52:31] together right anybody
