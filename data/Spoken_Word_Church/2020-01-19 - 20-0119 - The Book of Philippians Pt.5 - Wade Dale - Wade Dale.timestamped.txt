[0:00] table is just for the light it is not
[0:04] for nobody else we don't want to be
[0:08] exclusive but God made us exclusive he's
[0:11] only got one bride in this end time
[0:15] there's one bride that's got a
[0:17] commission to take all the word and make
[0:19] all the work come to pass and not be one
[0:23] word off right if you say it can't be
[0:26] done then you need to baptism with all
[0:27] ago right because it can't be done
[0:30] that's what the Holy Ghost was give to
[0:31] is to lead us and guide us into all
[0:33] truth he's the one that wrote the Bible
[0:35] he's one that spoke when he was here on
[0:36] earth 2,000 years ago he ought to be
[0:39] able to keep it right there never was a
[0:41] time when Jesus walked out and said no
[0:42] man my father has been having an
[0:44] argument back here in the tent no he
[0:48] said whatever the father does I did
[0:49] whatever is bother said I st. Michael
[0:52] the same person amen I can't I can keep
[0:57] my story straight if it's my story cuz I
[1:00] was there and I did it so now what the
[1:03] Holy Ghost is doing to you folks is he's
[1:05] taking us and putting us like I said
[1:07] before he's putting us to where the
[1:10] writer of this is in us the one that
[1:14] wrote this what's the Holy Ghost
[1:16] remember men moved by the Holy Ghost
[1:20] Luke and Martin Wendy went around when
[1:23] Jesus was around and they had perfect
[1:25] understanding to write the Bible Paul
[1:27] wasn't around when Jesus was around Matt
[1:31] we literally Matthew and John were
[1:33] pretty much the only two maybe James and
[1:35] some of the lesser ones Peter but 90% of
[1:39] your Bible was written of either future
[1:43] things are things that were passed and
[1:45] they weren't even in them they weren't
[1:47] even in the age that they were standing
[1:48] there like damn
[1:50] Damon cherish got them in the streets
[1:53] when he saw us going up and down the
[1:56] road in them on the interstate but man
[1:58] that was 6000 years ago
[2:02] probably nobody understood that and
[2:04] nobody didn't understand it it's my life
[2:06] - what Berlin said we got to have an
[2:08] updated revelation nails revelation was
[2:12] he saw cars with headlights but there
[2:16] was no such thing back then he called
[2:18] him chariots jumping in the street
[2:20] Jonathan what lets bumping into each
[2:23] other row break he saw a road rage 6000
[2:26] years ago but he didn't know what to
[2:28] name it it's like the encyclopedia that
[2:30] me and brother boys talk money yes ma'am
[2:32] he gave me a true original Webster's 18
[2:36] whatever dictionary you're doing have a
[2:39] car in it it don't have computer all
[2:44] these different things that we have now
[2:48] they never had one in 1800 the thing you
[2:51] know even a light bulb electricity some
[2:55] of those things are not even in that in
[2:58] that dictionary so if they had to have a
[3:00] what an updated version now listen it
[3:04] didn't change it didn't change the word
[3:08] don't change to get an updated
[3:10] revelation that the Seventh Seal is you
[3:13] can help realize that's not an updated
[3:15] revelation from God that might be up
[3:17] something from the devil but an updated
[3:20] revelation keeps in the continuity of
[3:22] the word all the way but you and I know
[3:26] we have for example we do have a
[3:29] definition of a computer we know what
[3:31] that is we know what a car is we know
[3:33] what a buy it is we know what a terabyte
[3:36] we'll know what if you see one of them
[3:38] they didn't know that even 50 years ago
[3:42] you didn't have the word computer they
[3:47] know wait a lot remember the old could
[3:50] never remember who remembers the old
[3:51] abacus as always yes you have to set
[3:56] that thing out the old computer of the
[3:57] day he set that say ahead little balls

[4:23] teachers let's embrace your hand for
[4:26] those either remember that I'm not an
[4:29] idiot okay
[4:30] tiny little sides budding together you
[4:32] know all the way here and then somebody

[5:02] doing man yeah and you push the button
[5:04] and it had some arms at one out and you
[5:06] put your chalk in there and when you
[5:07] pulled it back in it held a chalk and
[5:11] that them that you put chocolate free
[5:24] this was fifty years ago I'm still 50
[5:29] years it's been 50 years that we did
[5:32] this and so we come from 50 years now
[5:34] what is it listen I mean let me tell you
[5:39] what jobs are created Louise wouldn't
[5:41] have a job if he was back in them Bob
[5:44] wouldn't have a job that was never
[5:47] created until he got here if I got that
[5:51] I mean really there was no social media
[5:53] there was no and everything now whatever
[5:56] thing now there's you turn this thing on
[5:58] in all classrooms and everybody's got
[6:01] one of these well you know 50 years ago
[6:04] we might have had one of these but it
[6:07] had the lines in it and we wrote with
[6:09] chalk
[6:11] yeah and just if you had an ancestor no
[6:16] one knew had to skate guess what you
[6:19] should be worth a lot of money but you
[6:21] see what it may not seem like with the
[6:22] Word of God Word of God never train
[6:23] whistle education never changed you

[6:30] second third you still that that is
[6:32] still the basis of everything that's
[6:34] going on but now the things even the
[6:36] same that Deanna's doing in school now
