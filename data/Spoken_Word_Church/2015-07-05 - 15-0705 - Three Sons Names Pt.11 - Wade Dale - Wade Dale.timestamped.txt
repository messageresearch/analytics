[0:12] Wednesday for Jamaica and just keep you

[0:23] doing youth camp never solely done you
[0:28] count before so I'm looking forward to
[0:33] it they'll be blessed yeah they'll be
[0:37] bliss they'll be blessed all right let's
[0:40] go to join and rejoin just where we were
[0:42] thinking before John one let's continue
[0:49] our thought now now we're on we're
[0:52] talking about fork or brother Vernon say
[0:59] we are we are speaking a free son's name
[1:05] brother ground seat bud God comes in
[1:08] three sons name some gods or actually he
[1:11] says some math some gun it son David and
[1:14] not trying to correct the Prophet I'm
[1:17] not but he was the son of God first cuz
[1:21] that's the Creator what brother Brown
[1:23] saying is when Jesus come on earth there
[1:27] was the son of man that's where God came
[1:29] and three sons name alright because he
[1:32] was the son of God in the Old Testament
[1:34] he didn't come to his people he was
[1:36] about remember he was above with right
[1:39] and now in all right Joey was above as
[1:43] the son of god that's the Creator we
[1:45] already spoke on that the theophany the
[1:47] low got the speech all the word right
[1:50] here in the beginning was the logos in
[1:52] the low coffee with god in the logo
[1:54] what guy the same was in the beginning
[1:56] with we've got that's the Sun God right
[1:59] but then he came as son of man because
[2:03] man is where the fall came from right
[2:08] the son of god never felt I think the
[2:11] Sun God's eternal God never had a bad
[2:13] thought that doesn't know anything of
[2:15] sin right that's a creator that's God
[2:19] Himself that's the father that's the
[2:21] father he was made manifest in the form
[2:23] of the Son of God but that's the eternal
[2:26] God ok now the son of man had to be made
[2:30] eternal in the form when he was in flesh
[2:32] because when he came in flesh it was not
[2:34] eternal right no cuz it explains an
[2:38] eternal right all right he had to come
[2:41] this the Sun God had to come in the form
[2:43] of the son of man to come into human
[2:46] flesh because that's where man felt Adam
[2:51] did not fall in its theophany it
[2:56] involved he can't you can't fall that's
[2:59] why that's why the the problem with us
[3:01] is is saying and still telling us even
[3:04] though we got the Creator inside of us
[3:06] enough power in its the Prophet God said
[3:08] to create a world you live on you got
[3:10] that inside you now but the devil's got
[3:11] it so bound because it's not a dent well
[3:16] well we only have it by measure so a
[3:21] measure of God is God eternal is eternal
[3:26] there's not degrees of eternal some
[3:29] people are not gonna live lower than
[3:30] others in eternity right and we're only
[3:34] on the same amount no Sam downtown so
[3:37] that there's no degree now there is
[3:38] degrees here because remember as we were
[3:41] talking about last Sunday jesus said if
[3:44] you say something that gets this form it
[3:47] will be forgiving you Wow because the
[3:50] atonement had not been released from
[3:53] this man to come back on to the believer
[3:56] but now jesus said you speak against the
[3:59] Holy go it'll never be forgiven right
[4:04] and then so the atonement had not been
[4:07] made so so Peter could curse Jesus and
[4:13] not get by with it but there was a
[4:15] remember as we were talking about a
[4:19] couple of seconds ago the Old Testament
[4:22] was right up to the day that Jesus died
[4:28] right right matthew mark luke and john
[4:30] is a commentary of the of what happened
[4:33] in Jesus's life boo but the death of the
[4:36] testator created the new testament jesus
[4:39] said this is the New Testament in my
[4:41] blood it won the New Testament Matthew
[4:44] Mark Luke and John the New Testament was
[4:46] ax1 rights to actually when the Holy
[4:50] Ghost fell on the believers that's when
[4:52] the New Testament when Jesus died there
[4:55] was 30 to 40 days then he ascended ten
[4:58] days later was the bed Pentecost that
[5:00] started what the dispensation of the Sun
[5:03] God again right because remember brother
[5:06] bryan said he died Son of Man some dog
[5:08] can't die that's why I don't never died
[5:15] once heat the eternal life was breathing
[5:18] at him and he became a eternal person
[5:20] with God he couldn't die and even we see
[5:25] the first martyr I was listening brother
[5:26] brownie yesterday the first martyr which
[5:29] was Steven bottle said he fell asleep
[5:32] right so you don't die your fault sleep
[5:36] right you fall asleep because this man
[5:38] can't die the problem with the problem
[5:42] we have is as we let this this part
[5:45] outside man take over the inside man
[5:48] right yes we only let this guy out every
[5:51] once in a while right and that's our
[5:54] problem but you know what it's not a
[5:57] problem God he knew that he knew he knew
[6:00] when he put him in human flesh he would
[6:02] fall yeah but he didn't make him fall he
[6:06] could have lived in human flesh that
[6:08] human flesh could have been matey turn
[6:10] right right collect what's going to
[6:12] happen in our body change we're going to
[6:16] go
[6:16] to the place where adam should have been
[6:19] and Eve had they know they'll fall we're
[6:23] going to be body spirit and soul eternal
[6:25] God right but now as the Son of God if
[6:32] he never failed there's no way there's
[6:34] no atonement that has to be made God had
[6:37] to drop down into the form of the Son of
[6:39] Man drop down into the form of what man
[6:43] us ma'am like said Eva Melchizedek
[6:47] brother Ron said he appears many times
[6:49] in the Old Testament and he did captain
[6:52] of the host Melchizedek pillar fire all
[6:57] those things he came in the Old
[6:59] Testament but there was no form that man
[7:02] could see him and he feared of Moses
[7:04] backside of a man c you guys always been
[7:07] a man so you can't say well this is just
[7:09] the spirit no this is actually this is
[7:12] more real than than this man because we
[7:18] worship in spirit and in truth not
[7:20] inflation in true we worship Him in
[7:22] spirit entry alright so we worship them
[7:25] and what happens with this body if this
[7:28] body does that's what I've said and I
[7:31] told him in philippines and they really
[7:33] laugh about it but you got to think
[7:34] about Paul when they cut his natural
[7:36] head off this theophany was so strong
[7:39] and so eternal he didn't have to pick
[7:41] his head up on this in the safe
[7:42] dimension when he stepped over he'd have
[7:45] to pick any part of him up that axe
[7:48] never killed that part of hills that was
[7:51] inside of it you can shoot him pull them
[7:55] apart cut their hello this guy but that
[8:00] inside man is so strong he's when he
[8:04] stepped over nine other dimension he's
[8:05] more real than he was in this defense
[8:07] right and I said it will be no bullet
[8:10] holes or whatever ever how people but
[8:12] not
[8:13] we give you back cuz what gone set aside
[8:17] a spirit part of him Genesis 1 26 min
[8:21] that to me is more real that's why
[8:24] people would understand that that's the
[8:26] more real part of you than it ever will
[8:28] be this flesh man right because he
[8:32] created that man he Colonel and it's not
[8:37] a creation we understand that we've done
[8:39] our creation it's bringing together and
[8:42] forming so son of God within the Old
[8:46] Testament above the people could not get
[8:49] into people because of the blood of
[8:51] bulls and goats that's your old
[8:53] testament in the Old Testament there was
[8:57] not the death of a man it was a death of
[9:00] an atom right that made the Old
[9:03] Testament under bulls and goats all
[9:06] right but remember that only covered sin
[9:09] didn't do away with it the man that has
[9:14] no sin couldn't get into the men that
[9:17] were sinning by the lame the Old
[9:21] Testament had what we call the new birth
[9:24] and then sure they were saved sure a
[9:27] bruh ham Isaac Jacob they're all going
[9:30] to be there but when Jesus died he died
[9:32] looking back to them and they were
[9:35] looking to Calvary right but there was
[9:39] no end well II there was no bride in the
[9:42] Old Testament never spoken about sure
[9:44] Israel was Jesus's bride but guess what
[9:47] can't put her away right he divorced her
[9:51] but us that's the bride of Jesus Christ
[9:55] it's this man in this man right and then
[10:00] we'll finish let's continue all things
[10:03] were made by him and without him was not
[10:06] anything made that was made and him was
[10:09] life the life was the light of what men
[10:11] now in verse 14 says what Brenda brown
[10:14] always quote says he doesn't stop up
[10:16] there at the top he always brings it
[10:19] down but what but it's let's read verse
[10:23] 12 he came into his own zone receiving
[10:25] hunter
[10:26] but as many as received him to them he
[10:30] gave power to become the sons of God you
[10:36] had to receive it David to them gave he
[10:39] power to become the sons of God even to
[10:41] them that believe on his name which were
[10:46] born not of blood this is 126 man was
[10:51] not born of blood it wasn't born of
[10:54] flesh or the will of the flesh we were
[10:56] born because of the will of the flesh
[10:58] the flesh that we have is the permissive
[11:02] will of God to get you here to make your
[11:04] choice I mean that's about as simple as
[11:07] you can make all right and God knowing
[11:10] who he is sure he can have it ready for
[11:13] you when you get here but remember I
[11:15] don't believe you came here with eternal
[11:17] life you can't hear with eternal life
[11:18] you didn't need Jesus to die on crop
[11:20] there's no need of salvation sure
[11:23] there's a predestinated seed but where
[11:25] was it it was in the mind of God he knew
[11:27] who you were he knew who his children
[11:29] were and he knew what David wanted so he
[11:32] put it in the word for you that's why we
[11:34] believe that the seed is the word of God
[11:36] I don't believe it anywhere you'll ever
[11:38] find brother brown sand the seed was
[11:40] anything but the word of God alright
[11:42] which were born not of blood nor the
[11:44] will of the flesh nor of the will of man
[11:46] but of God jesus said remember he was
[11:50] seated in this scripture here Nicodemus
[11:53] said we gotta come back and getting her
[11:55] mother's womb but he was on my flesh and
[11:56] blood he is he you not be born from
[11:59] where above them you got to be born from
[12:01] above nor the will of man but of God and
[12:04] the logos or the Word was made flesh
[12:07] which made him what lease on a man right
[12:11] and we beheld his glory to glory as the
[12:14] only begotten of the Father full of
[12:15] grace and truth right this is John bore
[12:20] witness of me but John can only bear
[12:23] witness of it you and I have that man
[12:26] inside of us
[12:27] the witness right all right good John
[12:29] was still John was born under the Old
[12:32] Testament right John was an Old
[12:36] Testament prophet but the greatest of
[12:38] the prophets why he was the hinge Jesus
[12:42] was the door he was one brought him what
[12:45] Malachi says turn the hearts of the
[12:48] white fathers to the children what the
[12:51] Old Testament father's John was calling
[12:54] me old I'm talking about John the
[12:56] Baptist now not not John the Revelator
[12:58] join the battery was calling the old
[13:00] testament to the new the man that's what
[13:05] he that was his job that was his
[13:06] six-month message was to say there's one
[13:09] coming that's going to take this from
[13:11] the Old Testament and turn it to the new
[13:14] all right and it's going to be a total
[13:16] indwelling of the Holy Ghost not just an
[13:18] anointing all right so V son of mail
[13:22] comes on the earth which is Jesus Christ
[13:26] all right he's the beasts on a man i
[13:29] guess i should have wrote these on man
[13:30] because he is these on a man why is he
[13:33] the son of man because you were born
[13:39] something
[13:43] he was born with this already any that's
[13:47] why I don't believe that we come here
[13:48] with eternal life come if we came here
[13:51] with God already in us at an indwelling
[13:54] and I so we would be the Son of Man
[13:58] right if I get that same man we leave
[14:01] east on a man and we're not the Son of
[14:03] Man we're a subtle man why we come down
[14:06] here as a son of samuel and Peggy Dale
[14:08] right to make our choice to ask this man
[14:13] to dwell in us a man to me that simple
[14:20] when you think about it the people who
[14:22] have the doctor that they came here with
[14:25] that scene
[14:27] quoted sure but we know now that it's
[14:32] we're born by the word seed its plant
[14:35] that's right a baby in utero does not
[14:38] neared the word no see you baby in the
[14:41] womb not even Bowl not even alive
[14:43] brother Brad explain that does he said
[14:45] it's just wiggling muscle that's all we
[14:48] get we get an emotion he said that's
[14:50] what the back I'm in the Pentecostal gut
[14:51] they got an emotion surely lean muscle
[14:54] but there was no life the life comes
[14:57] when the baby is born the light comes
[15:02] when the baby is born again in our case
[15:05] because the first time we were born a
[15:07] little more dead right I just I don't
[15:09] like Paul Paul said one time he said I
[15:12] conclude all understand anyway there's
[15:16] no different and nobody where I conclude
[15:19] that we're all born born in other words
[15:21] my brother man said morning San shapen
[15:23] in iniquity and then the light of the
[15:27] gospel shines on and then that seed that
[15:31] was predestinated before the foundation
[15:32] of the world sure why does it come to
[15:35] life because it's been water ma'am you
[15:38] got to get the watering of the word
[15:40] washing by the one word see because you
[15:43] can take a seat that's got potential
[15:45] life in it you can lay it on that table
[15:47] right there it will never produce but
[15:51] it's a seed and it's got life in it but
[15:55] eventually it's going to knock basically
[15:58] that life is going to go away but if you
[15:59] take that seed and put it in fertile
[16:01] ground put some water on it put it in
[16:03] the right environment because I just
[16:06] conclude one thing for sure brother
[16:08] branham and I got a quote not i'm not
[16:09] going to read it this weekend my reason
[16:12] when i get back brother brown said every
[16:14] person born on the earth was born to be
[16:17] a son gun every person was born to be a
[16:21] son gun
[16:22] even though the mansion no that's pretty
[16:23] much verbatim what everybody he said you
[16:25] have a thirst to serve God now see to me
[16:30] that's that's where everybody's on the
[16:32] same playing field you have a thirst now
[16:35] what you do with that first you can
[16:37] either put it on alcohol or women are a
[16:39] beer I mean a cigarette but there's a
[16:42] thirst in man some wearing you know what
[16:44] the devil do that the devil knew that he
[16:47] knew there was a thirst in man to serve
[16:50] God he just he just took one to serve
[16:52] the guy he wants him to serve him so man
[16:56] makes a choice whether to serve God or
[16:59] Willard to serve the devil there's only
[17:01] two people involved here the only god
[17:03] that's the only two there's no gray area
[17:05] and there's no King priest or bishop in
[17:08] between amen everybody okay same at any
[17:15] man so this son of God came on in april
[17:21] of bc 4 and was born in a manger in
[17:27] flesh the understand what said in april
[17:31] for bc he was born in flesh in bethlehem
[17:35] that man went to flesh you and I and
[17:39] nobody from before or after was born
[17:43] that way a man he's the son of God he's
[17:48] the son of man now we are a Sun God and
[17:53] we are a sauna man right once this
[17:58] enters this that makes you what God in
[18:01] human flesh and the Word was made flesh
[18:03] and and burning Manahan was made flesh
[18:07] if he was a word before back in the
[18:10] attorney that word come down with my
[18:13] flesh but now remember but he was born
[18:17] of blood and a flesh
[18:20] not a will of God at that moment but as
[18:26] you go through life God knew what you
[18:29] needed he knew the very word that would
[18:32] spark you you remember the day of
[18:34] mourning him there was a bear that was a
[18:35] word there was something that haunted
[18:38] you and it was not just the words of the
[18:42] land it was the words of God but he came
[18:44] from the scripture you didn't born that
[18:46] you can get born again reading true love
[18:48] story magazine or watching General
[18:50] Hospital right if you're truly born
[18:54] again you heard from your theophany
[18:56] which was what the word we just proved
[19:01] all that the words of the oppening right
[19:05] but it's not have been having somewhere
[19:07] where did that work laying it didn't
[19:10] land in your neighbors hit land it in
[19:13] flesh right so there than me puts all
[19:17] the clothes together puts all the
[19:19] scriptures together because I conclude
[19:22] all like Paul born in sin and even
[19:26] brother Brown says the oneness with God
[19:28] he says the reason the disciples
[19:30] couldn't understand Jesus is because he
[19:32] wasn't in them yet I've always asked the
[19:33] people that thought this says that we
[19:35] come here with eternal life I said he'd
[19:37] be here come here with eternal life they
[19:38] said yeah said he was standing there
[19:40] with the Word made flesh so when Jesus
[19:43] said receive the Holy Ghost he should
[19:45] have just received it right there did it
[19:46] mean good wine eternally the samples
[19:50] insane don't worry one day you'll just
[19:54] realize how you always was eternal well
[19:58] now there is a time when we really when
[20:00] we realize that if you're truly born
[20:01] again you're going to look back that's
[20:04] why I took a prophet to look back and
[20:06] say hey you were in the mind of God
[20:08] nobody ever taught us if we work up that
[20:10] we come from the mind of God we just
[20:12] read john three sixteen right we were in
[20:16] john three sixteen that if we believe on
[20:19] the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be safe
[20:21] and you know what that straight right
[20:23] that's true many people got saved
[20:26] because of that but now to be a son and
[20:28] daughter
[20:29] fun and to be the bride of Jesus Christ
[20:30] you gotta realize where you come from
[20:32] what you're doing here and where you're
[20:35] going right like what's going about last
[20:36] night you can show what brother rabbit
[20:39] is doing he's going back in the mind of
[20:40] God I said hey this is where you come
[20:42] from what he was doing was and a couple
[20:45] of quotes didn't then I have at home he
[20:47] says it takes the worry away it does
[20:52] when you realize you come from God and
[20:55] that connected with the word and one day
[20:57] that's parked in you and that made you
[20:59] an eternal person was gone to me that
[21:02] takes the worry away sure in our
[21:04] humanity we have worries okay so don't
[21:06] get us wrong with look why worry about
[21:08] nothing well forget that bit we had been
[21:13] if we worry over day but there should be
[21:16] an anchor of the soul they let us know
[21:19] that hey if I did what God said he all
[21:22] already had me a part of me waiting
[21:26] there was a part of my son inside of me
[21:29] naturally waiting to be manifested and
[21:33] abetting ground called marriage so then
[21:36] why would God I've always said yeah I
[21:39] think he quoted it last night but but
[21:41] let's go a little bit further with your
[21:43] daddy is the bottom that's where the
[21:45] seed come from mmm but this but brother
[21:48] I think was all or one of them said
[21:52] who's your mother the bottle says it's
[21:54] New Jerusalem where do you get your
[21:56] nourishment from your mother your daddy
[21:59] can't feed you if you're breastfeeding
[22:00] your father's out a picture right you
[22:03] get nourishment from the mother well
[22:06] this is your mother this is where you
[22:07] get your nourishment right here this is
[22:10] your nourishment your father is God he's
[22:15] the seed word but when you read it that
[22:17] comes your nourishment your nourishment
[22:18] comes out of that I that's why we're
[22:21] being born again that's why we must go
[22:23] up the statute of a perfect man and not
[22:26] just be not just stay spirit babe time
[22:28] we have to be a spirit babe yeah it
[22:30] starts baby but then you work your way
[22:33] up and the Word was made flesh and dwelt
[22:35] among us and we beheld his glory
[22:37] glory and the only begotten of the
[22:39] father now look if we would have all
[22:41] been born here with eternal life god
[22:44] couldn't said that because we would have
[22:48] been begotten that shows me right there
[22:52] the only big only begotten of the Father
[22:56] there's only one man came straight from
[22:58] God to flash remember there's
[23:01] Melchizedek program so we bypass the
[23:03] work we did we come around and it is we
[23:07] did bypass the word because the words
[23:08] right here the word was made flesh come
[23:11] straight from God to flesh we Came what
[23:13] to flesh to go back to God yes that
[23:16] right we came down here in flash now if
[23:20] there had not been a fault what we do we
[23:21] fell through that alright and we had to
[23:24] work our way back up man we fell through
[23:26] it it didn't stop because listen you
[23:30] can't be born with a word in yet you
[23:34] have to receive the word because look
[23:37] we're and we're going to do that in in
[23:40] Jamaica woodland young kids about the
[23:43] Ezekiel talking about a new spirit and
[23:46] then you hired a man and go to
[23:48] justification and I'm going to do the
[23:49] dirty glass and I'm going to actually do
[23:51] the dirty glass I'm gonna take a glass
[23:53] and put it in mud and show them
[23:55] justification sanctification baptism the
[23:57] Holy Ghost see if I can get him to drink
[23:58] out of that water but remember God won't
[24:04] dwell in that but now for him to reach
[24:08] and get the model he knows there's a pee
[24:10] knows that he's going to be able to use
[24:11] that glass he doesn't pick up they were
[24:14] glass in the field some he knows vessels
[24:18] a lot of diff honor investing with
[24:20] dishonor rights too so he's picking up
[24:23] the one that he knows he's going to
[24:25] clean up and pour a good water in and be
[24:28] able to use that vessel or that glass
[24:30] nobody got that right really simple but
[24:33] but still if we all see where we come
[24:36] from right what we're doing here where
[24:39] we're going to me that's what the seals
[24:41] reveal the seals reveal that we did come
[24:45] from God there was a part of us that was
[24:48] that Genesis 12
[24:50] six men because you gotta have a place
[24:52] to show I mean everybody even in our
[24:55] family i speaking in the philippines
[24:57] your brother Royals about the
[24:58] masterpiece family you got to know who
[25:00] your family is I mean you got to know
[25:02] where you came from just like we want to
[25:05] look at our ancestry we want to know
[25:07] where we come same thing with God most
[25:12] people were just birth and I don't want
[25:15] to make it seem frivolous are but Martin
[25:19] Luther didn't sit down I don't think he
[25:21] said and the revelation he had was was
[25:25] the just shall live by faith in other
[25:26] words God did it for me I'm going to
[25:28] believe what he said and that's it all
[25:31] right I believe he sat down and read and
[25:34] really went into jess is one and said
[25:36] well that's me I don't believe me I
[25:39] wouldn't believe he probably read
[25:41] revelation score survival was compiled
[25:43] during his time and outboard I don't
[25:45] believe it said to her revelations said
[25:46] well that's meaningless in the third
[25:50] aging church age no he did that but
[25:53] that's who he was yes because he was
[25:56] what recognizing the word but he took a
[25:58] profit like I said many times before it
[26:01] took a profit to get up high enough and
[26:03] what did he do he got up high enough for
[26:06] all of us to get up high with him right
[26:09] right he went brother man went up as an
[26:12] eagle we're still watch chicken right I
[26:16] saw people think well brother Brad went
[26:18] up there in the spheres and he saw he
[26:21] called us the legal ins highly he broke
[26:24] the sound back here oak that barrier to
[26:27] get up there well why did God just do it
[26:29] for one person sure he got up there
[26:32] first sure he was one but what was he
[26:35] doing he was calling everybody else up
[26:36] so you and I can come and we can speak
[26:39] of Genesis 1 and and we can speak of all
[26:42] the things that where we come from what
[26:44] we're doing here program said that's
[26:45] what the sales was that which was which
[26:47] is and we shall come that's the
[26:50] revelation and see to me that takes on
[26:52] with the nervousness the way the nervous
[26:55] part of me is it's all these people
[26:57] that's right around saying well you is
[26:59] eternal and you just realized it I don't
[27:02] believe that I'm adamant about that
[27:04] everybody knows me no no no believe me
[27:07] but they have their clothes well you
[27:10] know what Jesus said eat my flesh and
[27:11] drink my blood yet explained that either
[27:15] so we have to read between the lines see
[27:19] because I know from my experience I was
[27:23] lost I did things that lost people do I
[27:27] didn't do things that God did I didn't
[27:30] want to come to church now why would God
[27:32] BM you mean I won't come true why would
[27:36] God be in me and I go out and you know
[27:38] say bad words and do bad things no but
[27:43] he knew he knew just like a prodigal son
[27:47] like Oh Luise was talking about last
[27:49] Wednesday sure the prodigal son was a
[27:51] son but that son didn't know what he had
[27:53] he didn't know and you know what
[27:57] ninety-nine percent of us if that son
[28:01] were left on his way back we'd be going
[28:03] where you been waving doing why do you
[28:06] do this way need in there
[28:07] that man never said that he believed
[28:12] that Sun was coming back and he didn't
[28:15] wait 30 minutes to restore him he
[28:17] restored him roughing him he'll kill the
[28:20] calf bring the road bring the ring so
[28:25] what's ailing God God sprout always
[28:28] reading us I got nine things in the
[28:31] Bible that God won't ask you one of them
[28:33] is God will never ask you why I took you
[28:34] so long to be safe he'll never ask you
[28:36] that right the prodigal son's father
[28:39] never asked why were you man he never
[28:42] there's no commentary he just welcomed
[28:45] his son home why thought he knew the day
[28:47] that he come back yes he doesn't do that
[28:49] so so the son of god in the Son of Man
[28:52] no I said it won't be here next sunny
[28:55] but the next sunday looks start talking
[28:58] of Jesus as the Son of Man be son of man
[29:02] and what he did on the earth and some of
[29:06] the characteristics that makes us
[29:08] because remember what I said before
[29:10] brother Brian said I'm not the Son of
[29:13] Man now he didn't say I'm a son of God
[29:16] revealing the son of man he said I my
[29:19] son of man revealing the son of man so
[29:21] he had his revelation had come sure
[29:23] we're all sons and daughters of God and
[29:25] we'll never get away from that man but
[29:28] there was a Word made flesh Jesus has
[29:31] got to be back on her like he was the
[29:33] first time because he's the only one
[29:36] remember this don't take a body change
[29:39] it never needed a change it's never
[29:42] changed this needs a body change that's
[29:46] why the son of man had to come back in
[29:48] the end time just for a moment let me
[29:50] give you one more thing before we leave
[29:52] remember Abraham remember Melchizedek
[29:56] right remember the two that went to
[29:58] Sodom I still in June or somebody the
[30:01] other day I said now is the time for the
[30:04] Son of Man yes to be revealed you see
[30:07] while it was before it no listen lot was
[30:12] inside right right
[30:14] the two witnesses which program said was
[30:16] billy graham alone roberts this this gay
[30:18] thing has been started from way back in
[30:20] the forties on business right right
[30:22] building up but never has it been
[30:25] legalized in sodom and gomorrah brother
[30:27] Brown said lot was the governor right he
[30:30] was in a politic well remember what
[30:32] happened the other day five justices
[30:34] voted for the gay rights for voted
[30:37] against right that's right these four if
[30:40] you read some of their commentaries they
[30:42] are absolutely against it there's a lot
[30:45] lot was not in the majority lot became
[30:49] the minority so though he was a judge
[30:53] judging these four judges of the Supreme
[30:57] Court was totally against it they
[30:59] weren't even close hit was for this away
[31:01] and five brought it up for the boat that
[31:04] Justice Kennedy was one who swung to
[31:06] vote so now in Sodom and Gomorrah it had
[31:11] to be let's just let's just say this
[31:14] what it is justjust listen to him in
[31:17] it's never been legal in the United
[31:18] States of America for two people
[31:24] sodomites to marry each other right
[31:28] obviously in Sodom and Gomorrah there
[31:32] must have been some where they came
[31:34] along and voted it in because it was
[31:37] common practice and it was common law
[31:38] that's why they call this Sodom and
[31:40] Gomorrah that's what if you adults you
[31:41] know what Sonny is all right you know
[31:44] why they called him sodomites it must
[31:46] have been legal because remember laught
[31:49] was out of the city then lot goes to the
[31:52] city then the two witnesses go to the
[31:55] city and one brother L say he said they
[31:58] bloody blinded they blinded the eyes
[32:00] what Billy grandma home Robert blinded
[32:03] the eyes of those shot of mine
[32:06] lot was in there which is what I heard
[32:09] first baptist church in gainesville bill
[32:13] coats he said whatever the baptist
[32:15] church says i'll marry him if they say
[32:17] Mary on my home lakewood baptist church
[32:20] brother Tom smiling thank God for a man
[32:23] like him he said I'll never made one elk
[32:26] if you put a gun to my head so thank God
[32:29] for the one just seen as you foolish
[32:31] virgin there's the ones that's the lot
[32:33] people because remember programs did
[32:35] when we're gone see how close I'm
[32:37] telling you how close this is because
[32:39] that was a revealing of the Son of Man
[32:41] to Abraham right but Sodom had to be
[32:46] legal before that can happen and then
[32:51] those said get out brother Brown said
[32:53] we'll work on he said the ones that are
[32:55] left here are going to be hunted down
[32:56] like knowledge and killed from their
[32:58] stand for the gospel it's real close oh
[33:02] you say what another year or two so on
[33:04] it's closed now anything can happen in
[33:08] the United States of America since we
[33:10] have voted this this law in by the High
[33:14] Court they also said that they didn't
[33:18] say how many you can marry so they
[33:19] something that some people see the
[33:22] polygamist are already know they've
[33:23] already took it to the court all right
[33:25] they're saying if you let them you go
[33:27] with us and for men can marry each other
[33:31] now it don't have to be a couple right
[33:32] so a polygamous for coming in and saying
[33:35] hey what about a human you at least I
[33:38] was is somewhat natural but we can
[33:41] produce children we can you know we can
[33:43] do the things like that but but this is
[33:45] sort of my condition now we live now
[33:47] sure we've been living in it but I'm
[33:49] sure there's a time come with a lot
[33:50] because the Bible said it bangs his
[33:52] righteous soul there was a day come when
[33:54] they voted that in and saw them and go
[33:56] on and it really hurt lots feelings it
[33:59] really hurt like same email it's exactly
[34:02] what is happening
[34:03] for both in my heart oh I'm sure they
[34:07] will the forum voted against it you know
[34:10] they're not going to be very popular at
[34:12] all you know so we gotta go we gotta get
[34:16] freaking cool breeze Thank last not
[34:18] knowing where they're talking about in
[34:21] this wide open they've opened the
[34:26] floodgate
