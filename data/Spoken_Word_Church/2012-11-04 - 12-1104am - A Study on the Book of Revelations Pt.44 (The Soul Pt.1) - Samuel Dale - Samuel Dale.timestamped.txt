[6:25] we read your word you come and speak to
[6:27] our hearts in Jesus name
[6:30] amen Revelations
[6:33] 1 this makes 44 times reading it maybe
[6:36] we'll remember
[6:37] it the revelation of Jesus Christ which
[6:40] God gave unto him to show unto his
[6:43] servants things which must shortly come
[6:45] to pass and he sent and signified it by
[6:48] his Angel unto his servant John who by
[6:51] record of the word of God and the
[6:52] testimony of Jesus Christ and of all
[6:55] things that he saw blessed is he that
[6:57] readeth and they that hear the words of
[6:59] this prophecy and keep those things
[7:01] which are written therein for the time
[7:05] is at hand all right Revelation 6 verse
[7:11] 9 and when he had opened the fifth seal
[7:15] I saw under the altar The Souls of them
[7:18] now notice he saw the souls of them
[7:24] right that worst line they get killed
[7:28] right and go there he's not looking as
[7:30] I'll repeat in a minute he's not looking
[7:32] at physical corporal people no you know
[7:37] he's looking at the soul all right of
[7:40] that individual right all right and I
[7:42] saw under the altar The Souls of them
[7:44] which were slain for the word of God and
[7:46] for the testimony which they held and
[7:49] they cried with a loud voice saying how
[7:51] long oh Lord holy and true do thou not
[7:54] judge and avenge our blood on them that
[7:56] dwell on the earth and white robes were
[7:58] given unto to every one of them and it
[8:00] was said unto them that they should rest
[8:02] yet for a little season until their
[8:05] fellow servants also and their Brethren
[8:08] that should be killed as they were
[8:10] should be fulfilled you may be seated
[8:12] the Lord had his Blessing to the reading
[8:16] of the word we had a real great time
[8:19] last night at the Bible study you you
[8:24] know talking about sanctification and
[8:27] getting down into her own lives and just
[8:30] dealing with uh you know who we are
[8:34] right amen and what we're doing and try
[8:37] to find out why that we need to die out
[8:41] to oursel more and that's that's the
[8:44] thing we need right right
[8:47] now as we spoke the last message
[8:51] on you know trying to brother fory
[8:53] preaching this past
[8:55] Wednesday and uh but we were speaking
[8:58] about
[8:59] how
[9:00] that this group of people
[9:05] that John is speaking of it calls them
[9:09] Souls mhm under the altar right all
[9:13] right
[9:15] now then in being that are souls of them
[9:19] when brother Ram would get in and say
[9:20] Souls under the altar as I said then
[9:23] he's not talking
[9:25] about bodies and things like
[9:28] that
[9:29] but he's talking about souls of
[9:33] them all right now that's I've always
[9:36] tried to preach to you since the Lord
[9:38] showed it to me many years
[9:40] ago and my wife was asking me when it
[9:42] was and I don't know it back in the 80s
[9:44] somewhere that I put serieses in about
[9:48] the soul dra it out put it on cardboard
[9:52] and everything to try to help people to
[9:55] understand if you'll go back into that
[9:57] on the on your internet computer you'll
[10:00] find that and by the way we're having
[10:02] trouble with not our system but their
[10:06] system and we're not ba where in today's
[10:08] services will not be live according to
[10:10] brother Joe it's their problem it's not
[10:13] us but we've had trouble with them in
[10:15] doing it you know but it's their problem
[10:18] they said they' get it straight but just
[10:20] pray they will
[10:22] don't but now seeing that these are
[10:27] actually it it's it's not a
[10:31] body that's there not a human body you
[10:34] know not a mortal 16 element body no cuz
[10:38] it says The Souls of them
[10:42] right that were killed see right and
[10:45] were killed down here right and this is
[10:48] not a bodily form like we look at it as
[10:51] a mortal
[10:54] body but it's more
[10:56] real right than a mortal body that's
[11:00] what we want to deal
[11:01] with to try to get an understanding of
[11:04] what we're talking about now let's just
[11:07] take a few quotes and review a little
[11:10] bit back where we were to see who this
[11:13] is and why the prophet would give it
[11:16] unto us and then it'll unfold into some
[11:20] things that we can
[11:22] uh think about go ahead and pull up
[11:25] number one brother
[11:27] Anderson and look what your Prophet
[11:31] says this is paragraph 104 the six seal
[11:36] he said I always allowed them Souls
[11:38] under the altar to be the early
[11:40] Christian Martyrs right yep know he was
[11:43] confused on it himself right but we
[11:46] found out last night when the Lord broke
[11:48] that seal for us it absolutely is
[11:51] impossible it wasn't them it wasn't the
[11:53] martyred Christians or anything what was
[11:56] it why because they were gone on the
[11:58] glory
[12:00] come on the other side and there there
[12:03] was well see I like that to be able to
[12:06] say this is this way it can't be that
[12:10] way right you know you what do you call
[12:13] it the law of of percentage or the
[12:16] pointing out and see I like to follow
[12:18] the prophet where he says this can't be
[12:22] right you know the early Christians he
[12:25] said I thought it was until the seal
[12:28] broke
[12:29] right right so it can't be see all right
[12:33] and it was what we found out that they
[12:36] were the Jews that would come up during
[12:38] the time where the from the calling now
[12:41] the
[12:42] 144,000 which we get into tonight
[12:45] tomorrow and between the sixth and
[12:46] seventh seal 144,000 is called all right
[12:49] now he's not calling the fifth seal Jew
[12:52] the 144,000 right he say that's in
[12:56] between this is in between here you all
[12:59] right so what is
[13:01] it then we found out that they were
[13:04] Martyrs that had been killed and yet had
[13:07] not been had white robes on but their
[13:10] names had been on the L book of life and
[13:13] they were given white robes each one of
[13:16] them all right see that's why church we
[13:21] are an honored I'm not talking about
[13:23] just
[13:24] Lula right I'm talking about the people
[13:26] of the end time righten we are the most
[13:29] honored people corre that could ever be
[13:32] to be able to say that a prophet said
[13:36] this is what it
[13:39] ISL we're not in the well what is your
[13:42] input I don't like that I'd rather
[13:45] output and leave the
[13:47] building but what is your input of what
[13:51] you think this is well we teach it over
[13:54] here is this
[13:56] way well there's no way to have any
[13:58] faith
[14:01] but the problem is is why is it that we
[14:05] have the prophet's
[14:07] message that says
[14:10] this and we still want our own
[14:13] ideas I don't understand that right we
[14:17] still want our
[14:19] opinion well maybe he was wrong D you
[14:24] know well then he's not a prophet that's
[14:27] right
[14:29] right right that's
[14:31] sensible show me where the prophets in
[14:33] the bible was wrong yes Miss
[14:37] understood right because why because
[14:40] they spoke in a spiritual realm right
[14:43] and man was trying to understand them in
[14:45] a carnal right natural realm that's
[14:49] right right so that it's easy to
[14:51] misunderstand when a prophet said this
[14:54] is it and this is
[14:56] why that's what I like right amen other
[15:00] words this can't be right what more you
[15:02] mean it can't be because the prophet
[15:05] said it can't be right right all right
[15:09] then we're going to believe it that way
[15:11] if not let's quit quoting the prophet am
[15:14] go to our own ideas and our own
[15:17] thoughts I know the prophet said it this
[15:19] way but I think but around said that's
[15:22] what happened in the
[15:23] garden amen and that's what Eve done
[15:27] that's right and C all of these deaths
[15:30] yes sorrows and heartaches right because
[15:33] she said I
[15:35] think that's why I'm always say it the
[15:38] Constitution of the United States gives
[15:41] you a right to
[15:42] think but the Bible don't give you a
[15:45] right to think right well who are you
[15:48] I'm me who are
[15:51] you I'm saying the prophet's
[15:56] right and he shows why he believes it
[15:59] this
[16:00] way and see that way then you don't have
[16:02] to worry about
[16:04] it right then he goes on to the next one
[16:07] what he said to who who these were going
[16:09] to number
[16:12] two this is 21:18 of the fifth seal for
[16:17] they at this time if you notice this
[16:19] fifth seal being opened see the church
[16:22] is gone
[16:24] right it just can't be theold under the
[16:27] early church that that used to
[16:30] say I like what brother Maloney used to
[16:33] say he put
[16:35] TP he go down to his Bible and he put TP
[16:39] I said what that TP mean he said tried
[16:41] and
[16:44] proven then we'll to be able to stand on
[16:46] that if not let's eat drink and be
[16:48] married cuz tomorrow we die that's
[16:51] right but if we're going to believe it
[16:53] let's walk on Amen and he said if you
[16:57] ever did give attention
[17:00] now give attention why cuz this is a
[17:03] great
[17:04] controversy this feel
[17:06] seal so I want you to listen real close
[17:09] now you got your papers and everything
[17:11] write it down and these cannot be them
[17:13] Souls because the souls of of the
[17:15] righteous Marty and the righteous people
[17:18] the church the bride to
[17:21] know has done been took up y so they
[17:25] wouldn't be under the
[17:26] altar they've been Glory with the bride
[17:30] and watch for they are gone in a Rapture
[17:34] in the fourth chapter of Revelation and
[17:36] they was taken up and who are these
[17:40] Souls
[17:41] then see that's the next thing who are
[17:45] they then if they are not the early
[17:49] church this is Israel this is to be
[17:51] saved as a nation
[17:54] y all of them that are
[17:57] predestinated that's Israel that's
[18:00] Israel itself you say wait a minute you
[18:02] know in other words right people were
[18:05] sitting there arguing with him in their
[18:07] mind and he was telling them to hold on
[18:13] right but see it's Israel to be saved as
[18:15] a
[18:16] nation now we never knew Israel was to
[18:20] be saved as a nation right that's
[18:25] right you see why it's a controversy
[18:28] right we never knew that did you I'm
[18:31] asking you did you know Israel was ever
[18:34] to be saved as a nation now we all
[18:36] mangled up and you
[18:39] know right well why couldn't that be the
[18:42] 144,000
[18:45] then maybe that's the Israel to be saved
[18:48] as a
[18:51] nation but you see that won't work right
[18:54] no all right the reason that won't work
[18:57] is pull up num three we'll read the
[19:02] scripture you know us take
[19:06] it get it out of the
[19:08] way and when it opened a f seal I saw
[19:11] Under The Souls of them that were slain
[19:14] for the word of God and for the
[19:15] testimony which they held doesn't say
[19:18] for the blood of Jesus Christ is
[19:19] testimony they held all right that's one
[19:21] point and they cried with a loud voice
[19:24] saying how long oh Lord only in trth do
[19:26] thou not judge and avenge our blood on
[19:28] them that dwell on the earth can't be
[19:30] the bride cuz she don't want for Revenge
[19:32] right no right she says father forgive
[19:36] them just like right he said forgive
[19:38] them right all right so that's two
[19:40] reasons for not believing you but look
[19:43] at the next and white roads were given
[19:45] unto every one of them and it was said
[19:48] unto them that they should rest yet for
[19:50] a little season until their fellow
[19:53] servants also and their Brethren that
[19:56] should be killed as they were right
[19:58] should be fulfilled who is that
[20:02] 144,000 so now you're you're taking
[20:05] things out of the
[20:07] way that would be there in the
[20:10] questioning in your mind or you should
[20:15] be see that's why that I just keep
[20:17] pounding on
[20:19] something I know you say I'm going to
[20:22] hear this but you're going to hear it
[20:23] again you know why cuz you're the person
[20:25] that's not getting
[20:27] it if you ever have the thought in your
[20:30] mind that you're getting bored over what
[20:32] I'm saying you are the person that is
[20:35] not getting it wake
[20:38] up get a little common sense
[20:42] right right
[20:44] right I don't like the door is back
[20:47] there that's right I'm not trying to run
[20:49] nobody
[20:53] off but I'm not going to beg nobody to
[20:56] say why because that's your choice right
[21:00] you're a free more
[21:02] agent you see then the truth has to be
[21:05] placed is the truth and then we can take
[21:08] our own choice that's right all right
[21:11] now let's go into something and look at
[21:13] the next
[21:16] one we done read these but just going
[21:19] back over
[21:20] it 454 paragraph the fifth
[21:24] seal all right now we found out in
[21:28] Revelations 228 the same thing now or to
[21:33] settle it for those who know Souls now
[21:37] watch it under the alar of the breaking
[21:39] of this seal that had been slain were in
[21:43] the time between the death of Christ and
[21:46] the going up to the church now there's
[21:48] the Israel to be saved right yep you
[21:51] remember I was bringing it out last
[21:53] weekend the Old Testament Israel had a
[21:57] Redemptive
[21:58] under the blood of bulls and goats
[22:00] that's right they had a place to go
[22:04] to right the bosom of
[22:08] Abraham that was provided so it's not
[22:11] this group of PE this group of people is
[22:13] not the Old Testament
[22:16] people right you see you see why they
[22:19] have their Redemptive right they had
[22:22] their plan they have their their
[22:25] paradise and it was taken up
[22:30] but now if there is an
[22:32] Israel to be saved as a
[22:35] nation and to be saved between the
[22:39] calvary and the end time of the going of
[22:41] the church what are you going to do with
[22:46] them right what is their Redemptive
[22:53] plan where can they go to
[22:56] right
[23:00] you understand
[23:03] yes you've got to have a place a
[23:05] position a Redemptive plan for everybody
[23:08] right sure will it be foolish virgin
[23:11] they have theirs the Old Testament Jew
[23:14] had theirs
[23:16] right we have ours
[23:20] M the 144,000 has
[23:24] theirs well what about it if you're
[23:26] going to believe that this is Israel as
[23:29] a nation to be
[23:30] saved now you got to have a place you
[23:33] got to have a redemp for a form of
[23:37] redemption and you got to have a place
[23:39] that they can go
[23:42] to right so John plainly tells you and
[23:47] the the prophet verifying it this is the
[23:53] souls under the
[23:55] altar not in the presence of Jesus
[23:58] Christ the bride goes up into glory amen
[24:02] I can't explain it but even the Old
[24:04] Testament Israel went up to some
[24:07] place but Paradise was taken
[24:10] up we know that they didn't go into the
[24:13] presence of Jesus Christ because no man
[24:16] has approached the immortality so
[24:18] they're not there in
[24:20] bodies right but what are you going to
[24:22] do with this group of people if you're
[24:24] going to believe what he said here that
[24:26] we read this is this to be saved as a
[24:30] nation what are you going to do with
[24:34] them well we need to understand this
[24:38] yeah that means you don't understand
[24:42] right is that blunt
[24:45] enough if you say that we need to
[24:47] understand this that means you don't
[24:49] understand this because why would you
[24:52] not want a Plan of Redemption for
[24:55] everyone right what kind of a holy state
[24:59] are you in that you wouldn't want
[25:01] Redemption for
[25:03] everybody right there something wrong
[25:06] with you mentally look Al
[25:10] spiritually I know that I'm talking to
[25:12] all but I'm like brother brand I listen
[25:13] to him the other day he said sitting
[25:15] right here in this building he said
[25:17] there's two groups of people he said one
[25:20] of them just paraphrasing it is
[25:22] dependent upon the blood of Jesus Christ
[25:24] and all things to take him
[25:26] through said the other group is trying
[25:30] to figure out a way to work yourself
[25:33] somewhere but he said they're right here
[25:36] well I'm saying it right
[25:38] here now anybody out there is listening
[25:41] I'm not pastoring the
[25:43] world I'm not their Pastor don't send me
[25:46] your tith from out
[25:49] there I'm not your
[25:53] pastor but now if you want to listen and
[25:55] see if it'll help you that's wonderful
[25:57] that's
[26:01] right but For Heaven's Sake don't be a
[26:03] group of people that's lazy shiftless
[26:05] bums this morning that wouldn't get up
[26:07] to go to
[26:08] church so you can turn on the internet
[26:12] and call Brother Dale your
[26:14] pastor that's right
[26:17] okay is that being hateful no no it's
[26:21] truthful right cuz I'm not your pastor
[26:24] the word of God is your
[26:26] pastor all right now you say well
[26:29] brother Dale I'm your pastor well then
[26:31] all right if I'm your
[26:33] pastor we got a email
[26:36] address and you're TI to go in the box
[26:40] and if it don't go in the Box I ain't
[26:42] your
[26:44] pastor right there you go I've been
[26:46] aiming to say this because of the fact
[26:49] of the way people are see we have people
[26:50] that do listen that do cend her time
[26:56] sure but it's because of their choice CU
[26:59] they say I'm their
[27:02] pastor but just you know okay but listen
[27:06] what are you going to do with this group
[27:07] of people that is between the death of
[27:09] Christ and the going up the
[27:13] church you got to have a place for them
[27:18] right why because they're already
[27:20] basically most of them done been killed
[27:22] right cuz the church a went up yet so
[27:24] they could be more killed to me that's
[27:26] why that that he's going back and
[27:28] covering in in in the scripture that to
[27:31] be killed is they're killed right
[27:34] because at the time John was writing
[27:35] that he was looking forward and the
[27:38] people were going to be killed as fifth
[27:40] seal
[27:41] Jew but you got to have Redemption for
[27:47] them so now where's your
[27:51] Redemption they do not accept Jesus
[27:54] Christ as their
[27:56] savior
[27:59] no foolish
[28:01] virgin 144,000 bride
[28:06] right
[28:08] right they
[28:11] have a Redemptive plan through the blood
[28:14] of Jesus Christ right it may even be the
[28:17] white Throne as a foolish virgins and
[28:20] the people would receive it to it may be
[28:23] there but it's still a Redemptive plan
[28:27] right
[28:27] but now what do you do with this group
[28:29] of
[28:32] people I read a quote the other day to
[28:34] you know want to go back to it read want
[28:35] to make sure see but who does he say
[28:37] this is the people have been slay
[28:40] according to this seal between the death
[28:42] of Christ and the going up of the church
[28:44] he says the ikan group and all of that
[28:48] them true Jews with their names on the
[28:52] book right that's the Book of Life
[28:55] That's not the Lamb's Book of Life
[28:56] section
[28:59] The Book of
[29:01] Life if you watch my brother according
[29:03] to the
[29:04] scripture now I want you to remember
[29:07] this for later
[29:09] on and I took this out because it's a
[29:12] total repeat in just a minute but I want
[29:14] you to remember this these people that
[29:16] are the soldier of them that were slain
[29:19] M their names were on the book and if
[29:22] you watch my brother according to the
[29:26] scripture they could
[29:30] talk cry out speak hear and had all five
[29:38] senses not sleeping in the grave
[29:44] unconscious see that's what people think
[29:47] we get a minute so sleeping they think
[29:49] that when you die you just go down and
[29:51] they'll quote your scripture The Dead
[29:52] Know
[29:54] Nothing and they think you just in
[29:58] coma you
[30:02] gone nothing of you Body Spirit soul is
[30:04] alive anywhere that's what mankind
[30:07] believes because they know nothing about
[30:10] the dimensions and the heavens and the
[30:12] things that's right but look what we
[30:16] have by way of the Prophet amen that's
[30:18] right to explain to us all of these
[30:20] things that's right we don't have to
[30:23] worry right so keep that in your mind
[30:26] they're not sleeping in the grave
[30:28] unconscious they were very much awake
[30:31] and they could talk speak hear anything
[30:32] else is that right is that right they
[30:36] could do it because what do they do they
[30:38] say to how long how long to avenge our
[30:42] blood
[30:43] right all right they could talk right
[30:48] all now what about it
[30:53] then what are you going to do with
[30:55] them h
[30:58] look at the next quote number
[31:02] five paragraph 120 questions and answers
[31:05] on the
[31:08] seals now yes these Jews are
[31:11] not not all the Jews will be
[31:14] saved no sir now see he didn't say every
[31:19] Israelite or every Jew or anything
[31:22] between Calvary and the church going up
[31:25] was going to be saved he didn't say that
[31:29] and that's what he's saying
[31:31] no not all the Jews will be saved they
[31:34] will not be saved only those who when
[31:37] he's speaking of the Jew Jew is just a
[31:40] name that was given to them after they
[31:41] left I believe Nebuchadnezzar over here
[31:43] is really a tribe of Judah as he goes
[31:45] down right begin to call him jeude first
[31:48] because the tribe of Judah was taken
[31:50] then and given a name of Jew now because
[31:55] they came down from Judea and they that
[31:57] got the name Jew but now Israel is
[32:00] different watch
[32:02] it Israel and Jew is all together
[32:06] different right all
[32:10] right every Jew every Jew isn't an
[32:14] Israelite
[32:16] right you go over there now and and they
[32:19] could maybe prove the tribe they come
[32:25] from but does that I'm going to be
[32:28] saved no we've had that explained to us
[32:33] every Jew is in Israelite see no he's
[32:36] just a Jew but then Israel Paul never
[32:40] said all Jews will be saved right and we
[32:42] went through that in Romans right
[32:45] 11 he said all Israel will be saved
[32:49] right
[32:50] amen now that's what Paul said in Romans
[32:53] we went through that to the verses huh
[32:55] he says why
[32:59] why will all Israel be
[33:04] saved why Israel's
[33:06] name that's the name of
[33:10] Redemption all the way back see and
[33:14] Israel will be saved but not all Judah
[33:17] Judah Judaism will be saved he's not
[33:19] that away now
[33:21] watch
[33:24] there tells you that this group of
[33:26] people
[33:27] right we know who it is yep right it's
[33:33] the Jews the Israelites the true ones
[33:35] that their names remain on The Book of
[33:37] Life not
[33:39] removed that died under
[33:42] persecution between Calvary and the
[33:45] going up of the Bride so we know who
[33:46] that
[33:48] is all right we know that they have a
[33:51] Redemptive
[33:53] plan
[33:55] m he said what is it it's the name of
[34:02] Israel that God
[34:04] said Jacob your name will no longer be
[34:09] Jacob it's going to be Israel
[34:13] right now wouldn't them Jews over today
[34:16] love to be able to think that their name
[34:18] was changed from Jew to
[34:23] Israel right so now they got a redemp
[34:29] you say well what and how it's through
[34:32] the fact that Jesus Christ died
[34:35] right but that he blinded his own
[34:39] people it's not every Jew not ever as we
[34:42] call it people of Israel the nation no
[34:46] they're going to even turn against
[34:47] 144,000 would even kill them
[34:50] right we'll get on into that
[34:54] later but think of it
[34:57] see because of the name of
[35:00] Israel and Israel being the name of
[35:06] redemption and that's only through the
[35:08] blood of Jesus Christ right cuz they
[35:11] can't depend upon the blood of bulls and
[35:14] goats right that's done gone that was
[35:17] the paradise that was the thing of the
[35:19] Old Testament that was taken up right so
[35:23] they have their even though they don't
[35:25] believe in Jesus J Christ but Jesus
[35:28] Christ at Calvary he said father forgive
[35:31] him right
[35:33] amen amen and the Bible said it the
[35:36] prophet said he blinded his own people
[35:39] that's
[35:40] right Paul said all Israel is not Israel
[35:44] all
[35:45] Jew but he said I have a people that I
[35:48] would be a Cast Away y from my people if
[35:52] it would save them y
[35:55] right
[35:57] who was it Elijah that said well Lord
[35:59] I'm Elisha one said I'm the only one
[36:02] that's
[36:02] left
[36:05] yeah God opened his eyes and he seen
[36:07] there was 7,000 that's right that hadn't
[36:10] even bowed the knee right right and
[36:13] Israel is crying out the Bible
[36:16] says far as
[36:20] people for him to be
[36:22] saved that give them Redemption through
[36:25] the blood of Jesus Christ
[36:28] that they wouldn't even
[36:31] have well I just can't understand that
[36:33] Brother D because that that that by is
[36:36] Jesus Christ you tell me how you got
[36:38] saved yeah come on right that's right
[36:42] did you get saved believing in Jesus
[36:43] Christ or was it Jesus Christ running
[36:46] you down which one was it right my Bible
[36:49] and Prophet says no man sought God at
[36:51] any
[36:53] time he come after us amen you don't cow
[36:57] right amen you might have to eat some of
[37:04] it the name of Redemption all the way
[37:08] back right all right so we have the
[37:13] Redemptive plan for them we know who it
[37:15] is we have the Redemptive plan for them
[37:18] now where are they
[37:20] going
[37:23] sold under the
[37:25] altar
[37:28] not under the Martyr I mean not under
[37:31] the uh Christian
[37:35] part but under the Martyr part right for
[37:39] their
[37:41] testimony so they have a place to
[37:44] go they can go as we'll get to it later
[37:48] they can go beyond the curtain of
[37:52] time they have a place we just read it
[37:55] right the soul hold of
[38:00] them it doesn't say bodies and spirit
[38:02] says the
[38:04] souls right what is a
[38:07] soul that's what we want to get to
[38:13] right
[38:17] now it's so beautiful how the prophet
[38:19] will disprove things that we thought we
[38:23] believed that's right
[38:27] and he'll tell us why right he said this
[38:30] can't be the bride
[38:33] no and he said it's not the
[38:37] 144,000 because we just read in the
[38:39] scripture there's a difference between
[38:42] this group of people that's under the
[38:44] fifth seal and the
[38:46] 144,000
[38:49] right and he tells us where they're
[38:51] redeemed and where they can go
[38:54] to when that person Di say right now
[38:58] somewhere say they're still being killed
[39:01] and we know they are over
[39:02] there and that person dies he didn't go
[39:05] in the state of
[39:06] limbo yeah
[39:10] sleep
[39:14] no even the
[39:18] Lost don't do that right you want
[39:24] Bible did not Jesus talk talk about the
[39:28] man who lifted up his eyes in hell so he
[39:30] had eyes right and he cried out I'm
[39:33] being tormented so he had
[39:36] feelings and he was concerned about his
[39:39] Brethren amen that s somebody up there
[39:43] to talk to him that's
[39:46] right do even the Lost
[39:49] y has a place to go
[39:52] right he said hell burning no he say not
[39:55] burning now
[39:57] he said be a pleasure right he said it's
[40:00] a constant
[40:04] falling he said I've been privileged to
[40:08] go to both
[40:10] places and you say well brother I don't
[40:12] understand that cuz how did he go to
[40:14] hell well he went
[40:18] somewhere some way cuz he said he did
[40:22] right
[40:23] right but I don't know of any other
[40:25] Mortal on Earth outside of Jesus
[40:29] Christ that done
[40:32] that so he was given an
[40:35] opportunity but what about
[40:38] it see that's what I'm trying to get you
[40:41] to read the
[40:42] seals and not read to just well what is
[40:46] this FAL that's that's sold to them that
[40:49] were
[40:53] beheaded see brother R said he take one
[40:55] seal and tie the the entire Bible
[40:57] together
[40:58] that's so you see then what he just said
[41:01] the Plan of Redemption through Israel
[41:04] you could preach the rest of your life
[41:05] off of The Plan of Redemption CU you go
[41:07] back in the Old Testament and bring it
[41:08] all the way down right amen you know
[41:11] that your Redemption comes by being
[41:14] listen not a natural nation of an
[41:17] Israelite but you become an Israel at
[41:21] heart and the Bible don't have any
[41:24] problems calling you a Jew as inward
[41:27] right because even a Jew that's inward
[41:30] is a chosen right
[41:33] right go Judah was chosen out of all the
[41:38] tribes for Jesus Christ to come to Judah
[41:41] that's right right so we see we're still
[41:44] in the
[41:45] Bible that's what I like about reading
[41:50] see and and get in there and read it yep
[41:54] and then see where it applies to you you
[41:56] and I amen
[41:59] amen and he's covering that these people
[42:02] have
[42:05] feelings they can
[42:08] remember they can
[42:13] reason but who are these it's the
[42:17] soul of them it says right that was
[42:21] killed so the soul must be the real you
[42:25] that's right
[42:27] and we'll get back to it later we're
[42:28] soul in spirit and interchangeable but
[42:30] we'll use it today to show you one thing
[42:32] for
[42:34] certain but around in the 40s and 50s
[42:37] said your soul is the nature of your
[42:38] spirit he also said that in 1963
[42:46] on
[42:48] soldiers in
[42:50] prison you didn't change that point cuz
[42:53] you don't have to change it amen
[42:57] the soul is the nature of the spirit
[43:00] right we'll get to that in a minute
[43:03] where people mess up they say it's just
[43:05] the nature of spirit there's no quote
[43:07] and brother around message run it and
[43:09] see come tell me anybody in the world
[43:11] coot bring it to me the word brother
[43:14] around ever said the soul is just the
[43:16] nature of the
[43:18] spirit no he always said the soul is the
[43:21] nature of the right well why are you so
[43:24] technical I'll read do this a minute I
[43:27] give it to you now if you say the soul
[43:30] is just the nature of the spirit you're
[43:33] leaving it just like an
[43:36] animal that has a
[43:40] nature dogs are not
[43:43] cats right they don't act like
[43:46] them see when you say it's just the
[43:49] nature you're belittling it you're
[43:52] bringing it
[43:54] down right and remember this
[43:58] point that you can be Anointed with the
[44:01] spirit of
[44:02] God the genuine Holy Spirit
[44:06] Y and be lost and die and go to
[44:10] hell right
[44:13] right see then don't play
[44:16] with things brother Dale you're just too
[44:20] they were saying like not that I
[44:21] shouldn't say anymore that I was too
[44:24] what was it too stub because everybody
[44:27] refers to stubborn as being like
[44:29] witchcraft so they told me I needed to
[44:31] use something like that I'm just I'm I'm
[44:35] firm I'm
[44:36] Stern you know maybe
[44:42] not but if everybody don't understand
[44:45] that being you know just being me I am
[44:48] me I've been this way all of my life
[44:51] right amen and God made me this way
[44:53] right that's right yeah did he made made
[44:56] me to a place that I'm just playing out
[44:59] me and I ain't going to bow to nobody's
[45:03] ideas but I will be corrected by The
[45:06] Prophet's message amen but not your
[45:09] opinion no right or concept that you
[45:14] have that will not fit the
[45:16] scripture I said when I was in the
[45:18] Baptist Church people had dreams of me
[45:21] being a preacher at time I said then I
[45:23] said if I ever do I won't preach man
[45:26] ideas I didn't know brother Rand said
[45:28] that but I did I said I won't preach
[45:31] man's
[45:34] ideas I said I'll preach the word of God
[45:36] the best I understand of course you know
[45:39] everybody says that right
[45:41] sure right you ever heard a preacher
[45:44] said he didn't preach the word of God
[45:45] true is no no they don't say
[45:48] that but listen
[45:51] Church let's think about what does these
[45:54] things reveal right it's like we're
[45:57] talking about in the you know that first
[45:59] seal second seal third
[46:02] fourth you know at the for seal revealed
[46:06] death and showed us really what death is
[46:09] but see we're reading it to just to find
[46:11] out the little quotes of what the
[46:12] symbols
[46:16] mean instead of reading it to see what
[46:19] it say into you and
[46:24] I let's think about this as we go into
[46:27] it go ahead with number
[46:34] seven paragraph 435 and then go
[46:38] into 438 on this one
[46:41] quote on the fifth seal I do not
[46:47] think by the opening I do think rather
[46:51] by the opening of this fifth seal as I
[46:53] believe that it's open to us
[46:56] it did with good conscience I did with
[46:59] it with good conscience with clear
[47:01] Revelation from God now that's wonderful
[47:03] not trying to just make it think because
[47:06] I always was against
[47:08] organization never will belong to them
[47:11] but it's open to me now Look and I do
[47:15] think another
[47:17] thing by the opening of this fifth seal
[47:20] in this day straightens up a Doctrine
[47:23] right here that I might speak of
[47:26] not the feel it's going to straighten
[47:27] out a Doctrine right
[47:29] amen not just that who this is that
[47:34] mankind has taught and that he always
[47:36] taught that it was the early
[47:39] Christians that's straightened out now
[47:41] he's going to show you something that
[47:42] straightened out that's a very simple
[47:44] thing just a few paragraphs and then he
[47:46] goes right on
[47:50] M and I do think another thing by the
[47:52] opening of this F seal in this day
[47:55] straighten up a Doctrine right here that
[47:57] I might speak of of Soul
[48:03] sleeping now I realize that there are
[48:05] people in here that does not believe
[48:07] that I mean does believe that excuse me
[48:10] see in the soul
[48:12] Fleet all right brother run it over run
[48:16] up number eight let me read number
[48:19] eight up number eight let's read
[48:24] it
[48:26] you got it now he'll explain where this
[48:28] Doctrine is from then we'll drop back
[48:30] now brother back up to where we were
[48:32] reading all right and this is off 1954
[48:35] questions and answers real to uh
[48:38] paragraph 24 and now many people the
[48:41] Adventist people now he's telling you
[48:44] who believes and has taught this like
[48:48] this the Adventist people believe that
[48:50] when a man dies that he goes right into
[48:53] the grave and stays there now watch soul
[48:56] body and everything else until the
[49:00] resurrection see like I said they give
[49:01] you scripture dead no nothing you just
[49:04] go
[49:06] into what would you go into cuz you
[49:08] rotten they they know your body rottens
[49:11] but everything just goes into the grave
[49:13] and just stays in some way you know and
[49:16] what they call that Soul
[49:19] sleeping he said well that's all right
[49:21] as long as they believe in being born
[49:22] again cuz I love the way brother R very
[49:25] nice about yeah MH but then you see that
[49:29] sth day adventage people in things right
[49:32] which is the basics of most religious
[49:34] people today right that if you die
[49:37] you're just
[49:39] gone you're just
[49:42] finished well if you're that way then
[49:46] what good is your Doctrine because uh
[49:49] uh a person that don't even believe in
[49:52] God would believe
[49:53] that cuz they got no sense to know you
[49:56] die but they think that's the end of it
[49:58] you know my brother is a Methodist
[50:00] Minister 12 years of college and
[50:02] everything else and he believes that the
[50:04] day you die is the end of the world to
[50:07] you that there's no end of the world
[50:09] it's just the day you die that's the end
[50:10] of the world to
[50:12] you cuz you
[50:18] g see you don't realize
[50:22] church right what an opportunity you and
[50:24] I have had Amen to at least hear the
[50:28] truth whether we believe it or not at
[50:31] least to be able to hear it not to argue
[50:35] it right but to believe it drop back
[50:38] into the the fifth seal number number
[50:41] seven come back
[50:43] up all right straighten out of doctor
[50:46] you're Soul
[50:48] sleeping I think this PR is pro that
[50:51] they're not sleeping they are
[50:54] alive they're bodies are sleeping but
[50:57] the
[50:58] soul not in the grave y they're in the
[51:01] presence of God under the altar
[51:04] right he can talk about a FAL Jew being
[51:06] in the presence of God under the altar
[51:09] yep where are you at if you
[51:12] die presence of God under the altar
[51:15] that's right there's only one dimension
[51:17] that can cure
[51:20] all and that's the sixth Dimension
[51:24] amen
[51:26] the sixth Dimension will carry all of
[51:29] those who are in any form religious
[51:32] matters Christians or whatever that's
[51:35] where we go to and we
[51:37] die you mean we're all going to be no no
[51:39] no he ain't going to be mingled together
[51:42] right
[51:46] no you going to be there with your
[51:48] people right he tells who he differs
[51:50] with the one that was teaching it the
[51:52] man that had itah Smith the doctor
[51:55] author of Daniel's
[51:57] Revelation now you people who are
[52:00] follower of his teachings now I don't
[52:03] I'm not just don't want to say this
[52:05] arrogantly but I just see but brother
[52:08] Smith and trying to support now this is
[52:10] a reason he tried to support and trying
[52:13] to support Soul sleeping there he
[52:15] mentions that the soul sleep and there
[52:18] is no altar of sacrifice in heaven now
[52:21] that's what the men taught and what that
[52:24] the only alter spoke of that he believes
[52:28] in in heaven is the alar of
[52:33] incense but to you dear people and not
[52:36] to differ with my brother differing with
[52:38] my brother oh probably to meet him in
[52:40] the on the other side not different with
[52:44] that great teacher but just to show you
[52:47] how this disproves that it disproves
[52:51] that the opening of this seal in this
[52:53] last days it just takes Soul sleeping
[52:56] out of the way see they're alive they're
[52:59] not dead
[53:01] right they're alive right as I said they
[53:06] even call
[53:09] out for Revenge y y they have
[53:14] feelings in
[53:17] things and it says the soul of them
[53:23] right now listen I know this I studied
[53:25] it since back in the the Baptist I knew
[53:28] back then that the word Soul and Spirit
[53:31] can be an interchangeable
[53:34] form Butz I studied the word back
[53:37] then and looked up things back
[53:40] then you know cuz I wanted to understand
[53:44] it and I knew the Bible and what it
[53:46] would say but you remember one thing now
[53:49] we'll get on over in a
[53:51] minute the Bible says the soul that
[53:53] sinth shall die doesn't say say the
[53:55] spirit that sent it right that's
[54:00] right
[54:02] right Jesus's Spirit when he died on the
[54:05] cross went back to God who gave
[54:08] it his soul is what went to hell
[54:13] right his soul is what came back on the
[54:16] day of Pentecost in the form of the
[54:17] baptism of the Holy Ghost right because
[54:19] you don't want just the anointing of the
[54:23] spirit right right
[54:25] all right
[54:30] now what is a
[54:35] soul how real is it
[54:40] right now even if you're
[54:42] lost you have a place to go to you
[54:49] die look around see it's got a downward
[54:54] pool
[54:58] you got a place to go
[54:59] to but Rand will even call it a
[55:02] Celestial
[55:04] body one time he called it a theoy of a
[55:08] sinner we will get to those
[55:12] things but what is a
[55:22] soul well brother D is just the Nature's
[55:25] Spirit now there's where you go and see
[55:27] just the nature of the spirit that is
[55:29] not even the truth that is not even a
[55:36] quote the soul is the nature of the
[55:38] spirit
[55:43] right always has been and always will be
[55:46] amen whether it be in brother Brown's
[55:47] early Ministry or later
[55:49] ministry right right
[55:52] amen the old is the nature the spirit
[55:59] right but Brother D I've always thought
[56:01] it was just the spirit of God that comes
[56:03] down to give me a new
[56:05] birth you better change your thinking
[56:08] that's
[56:12] right cuz remember body to body he's my
[56:17] brother Spirit to Spirit he's my
[56:21] God soul to soul he can live inside of
[56:24] amen amen
[56:29] right now we're going to get out to
[56:30] where brother Rand will say
[56:32] it on the fifth seal right on down below
[56:37] there he said that's where I saw my
[56:39] people yeah
[56:41] man not under the altar with them Jews
[56:45] or
[56:47] Israelites he's referring to where
[56:49] they're at now
[56:51] right we got a Plan of Redemption the
[56:53] blood of Jesus Christ and then you burth
[56:55] amen we've got a place to go
[56:59] to to abide there and what goes
[57:03] there Soul the body don't go the spirit
[57:06] don't go right the
[57:11] soul now watch it over and over cuz I'm
[57:13] going to keep quoting whether you like
[57:15] it or
[57:16] not the two Soul people that was their
[57:20] Doctrine the man that brought that and
[57:22] started that that's the way he quoted it
[57:24] and that's the way all you two Soul
[57:26] people quote it well what do you mean
[57:28] soul soul is just the nature that's
[57:32] Pur well what's the real
[57:36] you I'm talking about what's his
[57:38] thoughts are the real you
[57:43] right would it be the
[57:46] body it must have been because he wound
[57:48] up with a couple two or three little
[57:49] girls running
[57:53] around
[57:59] so what was his thoughts are the real
[58:08] you what's your thoughts to the real
[58:16] you let go ahead to number
[58:22] nine this is a message Grace now notice
[58:25] the dates and then you'll get back over
[58:27] a minute you'll see in 63 that he says
[58:30] the same
[58:31] point 1954 106 law Grace paragraph 100
[58:37] the first man went away under the
[58:40] law under animal's
[58:43] blood it couldn't change his
[58:47] heart he could be anointed right do
[58:50] great things kill a barer kill a line a
[58:53] giant
[58:55] even sing in the spirit yeah what
[59:00] you go an animal life won't compare with
[59:04] human
[59:05] life the animal can't give the human
[59:09] blood right right see the animal can't
[59:13] do it cuz his life is a different
[59:18] life and an animal has a
[59:23] life but not
[59:28] Soul now he's got a nature about him
[59:32] M right bird dogs
[59:37] dogs rabbit
[59:40] dogs they didn't even teach them to
[59:46] talk they got an elephant you see that
[59:48] paper the day they got an elephant now
[59:51] they can turn his trunk up into his
[59:53] mouth and speak
[59:55] Japanese I think he
[59:57] is he don't speak English cuz he's not
[59:59] an English
[1:00:03] elephant get you the
[1:00:06] life but they said it was audible
[1:00:10] words of their
[1:00:11] language because he was taught in their
[1:00:14] language he's been taught English he
[1:00:15] spoke
[1:00:20] English and an animal has a life but not
[1:00:22] a
[1:00:23] soul an animal is a living
[1:00:27] being but not a soul
[1:00:32] amen but God put a soul on man and see
[1:00:36] there is where people put a soul
[1:00:40] on there's where your two Souls said the
[1:00:42] nature of the just the nature of the
[1:00:44] spirit and he just put that on
[1:00:48] you uhuh your soul is your real you
[1:00:51] right amen we're going to read just a
[1:00:54] second where the Bible said the soul
[1:00:55] that's sin it so die not the spirit
[1:00:57] that's sin right right
[1:01:00] right so watch what he
[1:01:03] says so then my
[1:01:05] soul what is the
[1:01:07] soul that's what he
[1:01:11] says what does he say it is the nature
[1:01:14] of the
[1:01:18] spirit that's perfectly wonderful
[1:01:22] right and when this soul of Christ was
[1:01:28] left not left in
[1:01:31] hell but was taken up through the blood
[1:01:35] shedding of his blood when God taken him
[1:01:37] up to Calvary and mingled his blood out
[1:01:40] there on the
[1:01:42] cross you saying forgive them all kind
[1:01:44] of thing blood
[1:01:46] running now
[1:01:50] watch the scripture will get to it in a
[1:01:52] minute said he never left his soul in
[1:01:53] hell you know what they're teaching now
[1:01:55] in the
[1:01:56] message dumb preachers
[1:01:59] amen is that plain enough to get you to
[1:02:02] wake up they're teaching that Jesus
[1:02:07] sinned now I want to quote or the Bible
[1:02:11] I know you quote so don't send me your
[1:02:13] stupid
[1:02:16] on he died for me amen it was my sins he
[1:02:21] never sinned he was almighty God right
[1:02:25] because see they're trying to disprove
[1:02:26] that he's God they saying Jesus done
[1:02:30] wrong come
[1:02:32] on if you want to sit in my office later
[1:02:35] I'll tell you who these are but we're
[1:02:37] not on public big name
[1:02:40] preachers that's correct that you are
[1:02:43] listening to that's exactly correct amen
[1:02:47] say
[1:02:49] it Jesus died a
[1:02:52] sinner I know he did did cuz he had my
[1:02:58] sins it wasn't his
[1:03:01] sins if Jesus
[1:03:03] sinned he was not
[1:03:07] God Amen and we're following a false
[1:03:13] Doctrine to try to believe in God that
[1:03:15] would sin that's
[1:03:18] right well I got a quote come
[1:03:22] on I got a couple of
[1:03:24] too Jesus Judas died and went to hell
[1:03:27] you go too is that your words for the
[1:03:31] prophet you said you shouldn't be that
[1:03:33] way you you get all yes I get all
[1:03:35] upset whether you like it or not or call
[1:03:38] it
[1:03:39] mad I get upset of the preachers in this
[1:03:42] message that's packing down the poor old
[1:03:44] people's
[1:03:46] troes the only reason that internet's
[1:03:48] working is on account of that right
[1:03:50] because I was cut off from being able to
[1:03:52] preach that's right
[1:03:56] you know yourself I ain't went and
[1:03:58] preach nowhere have I why cuz I ain't
[1:04:01] been
[1:04:06] invited did you see now it's open the
[1:04:09] internet I can call them all kind of
[1:04:10] names can I that's
[1:04:14] right I'm not aggravating and
[1:04:17] hateful I love
[1:04:19] them sure I was listening the other day
[1:04:21] with brother R he said I'm not doing
[1:04:23] this yeah
[1:04:24] because of a Doctrine he said I'm doing
[1:04:27] this to straight out a
[1:04:30] doct he preached the straighten out do
[1:04:33] amen that's right amen he preached the
[1:04:36] truth that straighten him out
[1:04:38] amen why can't we believe it
[1:04:43] right it's kind of like we the old
[1:04:45] building here was and we had the tapes
[1:04:47] over here on the wall and the Man Came
[1:04:49] Here used to come get
[1:04:51] tapes and you know you come to church he
[1:04:54] come get tapes R
[1:04:57] around so he come here one day and he
[1:05:01] said you
[1:05:03] know God had to straighten out brother
[1:05:08] Bram I don't forget it I did I ain't
[1:05:12] going to argue with you
[1:05:14] right he went on a little while he said
[1:05:17] you had straighten him out like Jesus
[1:05:18] had to straighten out John the Baptist
[1:05:20] that got
[1:05:22] my temper or right indignation or
[1:05:25] whatever you want to call
[1:05:27] it I don't care cuz it ain't going to
[1:05:30] make me a dollar either
[1:05:35] way I told him I said wait just a minute
[1:05:37] I said I put up with you throwing off on
[1:05:39] brother brandom cuz I didn't want to
[1:05:41] argue with you about it cuz that's your
[1:05:43] opinion that's your idea but I said you
[1:05:46] show me where Jesus straighten John the
[1:05:47] Baptist
[1:05:49] out I said he come to introduce the
[1:05:52] Messiah right amen Jesus bragged on him
[1:05:56] that's y but you see that was 40 years
[1:06:00] ago what do you think people are
[1:06:02] thinking today sure brother Rand is
[1:06:04] wrong here brother's wrong if Satan can
[1:06:06] get into your mind that brother brandom
[1:06:09] was wrong you are defeated I'm going to
[1:06:13] say it whether you like it or not there
[1:06:15] is no Rapture for that form of people
[1:06:19] I'm talking about a change in a moment
[1:06:21] the twinkling of an eye there's no
[1:06:23] change in a w quickling either a person
[1:06:25] that believed brother R was wrong and
[1:06:28] then if you're stupid enough to believe
[1:06:30] that Jesus right done wrong is they're
[1:06:34] saying
[1:06:36] right and even
[1:06:39] sin I say this much there ain't even no
[1:06:41] hopes of that person to come up in the
[1:06:43] first resurrection that's right whether
[1:06:45] you like it or not that's plain now come
[1:06:47] on Amen you come and show me where it
[1:06:50] is I think it's time to just put it down
[1:06:52] and forget it amen amen what are we
[1:06:55] going to do oh but brother T you don't
[1:06:57] understand that's a good
[1:06:59] brother hell's going to be full of good
[1:07:02] brother that's what it was made
[1:07:05] for it was made for the devil and his
[1:07:08] angels and if that's what we believe we
[1:07:10] got to be one of his
[1:07:11] angels you said what brother Dale than
[1:07:14] you Lord I'm trying to save your
[1:07:17] soul if you're upset with me because I'm
[1:07:20] trying to save your soul I'm sorry right
[1:07:22] cuz I spent my life trying to save the
[1:07:25] soul to the people in this
[1:07:27] building I give everything that I've had
[1:07:30] to do
[1:07:31] that to try to speak to my kids I come
[1:07:36] so close to
[1:07:37] quitting yes but then I look back and
[1:07:39] say well what are they going to do right
[1:07:41] that's right I ain't the only people on
[1:07:44] the beach ain't never said to
[1:07:46] be but what people going to do if
[1:07:49] somebody don't tell the
[1:07:51] truth that's right amen praise the Lord
[1:07:54] amen that's it if I die and go to hell
[1:07:57] you let me go to hell I can go happy
[1:08:00] right because I've done what I believe
[1:08:04] to preach the truth of God that's
[1:08:07] right but who wants to hear
[1:08:09] it I can sit and tell people said I
[1:08:12] proved in
[1:08:13] 74 that we could pass the year 2026 my
[1:08:16] brother rown message and not a person
[1:08:20] yet has asked me to explain that
[1:08:24] of wine that I said
[1:08:27] right not a
[1:08:32] person so they don't want to
[1:08:36] hear they think I'm just s a date that
[1:08:41] way no I just proved by the Bible by The
[1:08:44] Prophet's message but who wants to hear
[1:08:49] it when the two Soul people were going
[1:08:52] around with their soul and all that
[1:08:53] people just running all over the
[1:08:55] country some of you were caught in
[1:08:59] it whether you want to agree with it or
[1:09:01] not you were caught in that
[1:09:05] Doctrine and have I become your enemy
[1:09:08] because I told you the
[1:09:10] truth if you got two Souls you got two
[1:09:13] Lords so this put the two Lord people
[1:09:16] together with the two Soul people then
[1:09:18] you got a whole lot of
[1:09:20] people
[1:09:22] right what is the soul what brother H is
[1:09:26] this is a real me all what's the real
[1:09:28] you what happens the day you
[1:09:32] die really
[1:09:37] know you got have a place to go to amen
[1:09:41] that's right yep no matter where you
[1:09:43] Christian or where you sin you got have
[1:09:45] somewhere to go to where you
[1:09:49] going I don't think we need to know that
[1:09:56] will Tire up half of your Bible and 3/4
[1:09:59] of the prophet's message oh mer and burn
[1:10:04] it what a man told me one time he said
[1:10:07] gifts ain't no gifts no more God laid
[1:10:09] them on the shift said you order to turn
[1:10:11] that out of the Bible there where it
[1:10:13] talks about yes I said hand me your
[1:10:16] Bible you better believe he didn't hand
[1:10:18] me his Bible cuz I would have ripped it
[1:10:20] out you say destroy the word of God no I
[1:10:24] destroy his
[1:10:26] Bible cuz he didn't believe in it right
[1:10:29] right that's right see we think oh
[1:10:31] that's so beautiful though did you hear
[1:10:33] that brother he said that you ought to
[1:10:35] tire that out of your Bible well see the
[1:10:37] devil just planted a seed of unbelief
[1:10:39] into your heart now you're going to have
[1:10:41] to have that
[1:10:42] seed torn out or it's going to kill
[1:10:47] you that's right mhm one of the two
[1:10:52] right right when the seed is Planet it's
[1:10:55] got to produce itself or be killed right
[1:10:58] amen what is our
[1:11:00] choice right so what is a soul the
[1:11:04] prophet
[1:11:05] said he said it's the nature of a
[1:11:08] spirit but he just got to explaining
[1:11:11] that an animal had a nature right
[1:11:14] M dogs don't act like
[1:11:17] cats no right it's the nature of the dog
[1:11:22] right
[1:11:26] and see are we just a higher form of an
[1:11:29] animal what's the
[1:11:32] difference he didn't put a soul the
[1:11:34] prophet said in an animal show me the
[1:11:36] Bible that's
[1:11:37] right he put a nature in the animal yeah
[1:11:41] a nature of a
[1:11:48] spirit but he didn't put a soul
[1:11:52] right
[1:11:55] you know what is it
[1:11:57] then I know forgive me it's forgive me
[1:12:01] for being me but trying to save your
[1:12:05] soul I'll give my life to try to save
[1:12:08] your
[1:12:13] soul had people to say brother Dale
[1:12:15] you're a prophet I've come to this pull
[1:12:17] pit and denied it go that's
[1:12:21] wrong I am not a prophet I'm talking
[1:12:24] about the five-fold ministry they say no
[1:12:26] I'm
[1:12:28] not I'm just a member of the body of
[1:12:31] Christ if you want to call me anything
[1:12:33] call me a teacher that's all
[1:12:37] right but don't call me a prophet cuz I
[1:12:40] don't have that Ministry if I had that
[1:12:42] Ministry this church would be
[1:12:47] empty because I'd call your sin
[1:12:52] out
[1:12:54] that's what a prophet does right
[1:13:00] okay so now
[1:13:04] listen the soul of
[1:13:08] Christ was not left in
[1:13:11] hell
[1:13:13] right
[1:13:15] right what the Bible
[1:13:19] say so now not leave his soul in hell
[1:13:23] right no and watch
[1:13:27] divided nor suffer my holy one right to
[1:13:32] see cor right y the Holy One was the
[1:13:37] body he was living in right yep so he
[1:13:40] wouldn't let that rotten in the grave
[1:13:43] right but the Bible said the soul yep
[1:13:46] I'll not leave his soul in hell that's
[1:13:49] right he went to hell we go over and
[1:13:51] over and over because of my sins did he
[1:13:54] go to hell right amen right he didn't go
[1:13:58] to hell to just preach to the souls that
[1:14:00] was in prison can never be saved he took
[1:14:02] my sin
[1:14:05] right and deposited in hell where the
[1:14:08] devil was at right
[1:14:10] amen but brother so and so so sweet
[1:14:13] Brother D he's not like you
[1:14:17] okay it's all
[1:14:20] right but there's one thing about it
[1:14:24] you'll hear the
[1:14:25] truth and you'll make your
[1:14:29] choice all right go ahead with number
[1:14:32] 10 look at the
[1:14:36] scripture Ezekiel
[1:14:39] 18:4 what does it say All Souls Are All
[1:14:43] Souls are mine right that's
[1:14:46] right it doesn't say the
[1:14:49] Christians right it says all soul amen
[1:14:54] there can't be a soul that God didn't
[1:14:57] create all right now order to do away
[1:14:59] with what you're thinking about a nature
[1:15:00] of anointing because Satan can pervert
[1:15:03] your nature
[1:15:06] yes he can anoint you and make you to
[1:15:09] what he wants you to
[1:15:11] be
[1:15:14] right look All Souls are
[1:15:20] mine whether you be a Christian or
[1:15:23] Christian you understand All Souls it
[1:15:25] doesn't say just the Christians are mine
[1:15:27] no no no All Souls are mine right as the
[1:15:30] soul of the father so also the soul of
[1:15:34] the son is mine y so it doesn't make no
[1:15:36] difference where what you are see all of
[1:15:38] it is watch the soul that sinth
[1:15:42] y it shall die right now give me a
[1:15:45] scripture where it says the spirit that
[1:15:46] sth it shall
[1:15:49] die so you better begin to realize the
[1:15:51] soul is more real than your spirit right
[1:15:54] it's more real than your body right it's
[1:15:57] the thing you're going to when you die
[1:16:00] not going to but it's where you
[1:16:04] are look at this one 10
[1:16:08] a fear not them which kill the body
[1:16:11] Matthew 10:28
[1:16:13] right but are not able to kill the
[1:16:18] soul ain't nobody nobody nowh Satan
[1:16:21] nobody can kill the soul of individual
[1:16:25] right God is the only one that can kill
[1:16:27] the soul
[1:16:29] right yep but fear him which is able to
[1:16:33] destroy both soul and Body in hell
[1:16:39] right
[1:16:41] right amen let's go back 61 get the next
[1:16:46] 11 message called
[1:16:52] faith and
[1:16:54] look paragraph 7
[1:16:56] 61813 for Faith now the soul is that
[1:17:00] part of you who knows and
[1:17:04] understands your
[1:17:07] intelligence but brother day I back for
[1:17:09] seals
[1:17:11] broke would you read the next verse
[1:17:14] somebody read
[1:17:15] it the vision I had not long ago the
[1:17:18] vision he had not long ago what you
[1:17:21] talking about yeah be beyond the curtain
[1:17:24] of
[1:17:30] time so the soul is a part of you that
[1:17:33] you you who knows and understands your
[1:17:38] intelligence
[1:17:40] right so then the animal has the
[1:17:44] intelligence of a spiritual
[1:17:47] condition because he's a
[1:17:49] spirit but he doesn't have a soul that
[1:17:53] can reason things out you can teach him
[1:17:55] to bark yes as where we the other day
[1:17:59] and haven't stopped by there and see him
[1:18:00] we go where we used to Camp Tre Vander
[1:18:03] and they had a dog and that old dog you
[1:18:06] could say
[1:18:07] booger old
[1:18:09] dog you say booger booger Bo look at
[1:18:12] that old dog say booger booger
[1:18:15] booger they got them now that can make
[1:18:17] all more
[1:18:19] sentences they ain't got them they can
[1:18:21] do everything in the world looks like
[1:18:23] like smarter than some of us human and I
[1:18:25] admit it but they got to be trained cuz
[1:18:29] they can't
[1:18:30] reason that's right they have a
[1:18:32] reasoning ability don't misunderstand
[1:18:34] that point MH because of being a
[1:18:36] spiritual condition they have a
[1:18:38] reasoning ability to them I guess you
[1:18:40] could call it but they can't reason they
[1:18:42] have don't no soul that's right their
[1:18:45] intelligence is what's trained that's
[1:18:48] right right now don't don't get on to me
[1:18:50] about it but the bird dog comes out
[1:18:52] being able yeah cuz that's his
[1:18:55] nature cuz that's in his Gene his
[1:18:58] makeup but
[1:19:02] look we not reading the soul is that
[1:19:05] part of you who knows and understands so
[1:19:09] is it just the nature of your
[1:19:14] spirit if it's just the nature of your
[1:19:16] spirit you only deal with memories and
[1:19:19] conscious affections imagination
[1:19:21] imagination
[1:19:24] won't give you everything no right you
[1:19:26] remember the vision I had not long ago
[1:19:28] where a little translation went into
[1:19:30] that place and saw those
[1:19:33] people now now your
[1:19:37] spirit will come back to that
[1:19:42] body watch you and that that kind of a
[1:19:47] body the
[1:19:51] soul which is a body that does not have
[1:19:53] to eat and so forth you remember beyond
[1:19:56] the curtain of tell me didn't have to
[1:19:58] eat see I've corrected my own things I
[1:20:01] used to believe just like everybody else
[1:20:03] basically today believes it I used to
[1:20:05] believe that you was a trown being body
[1:20:09] even I can quote with him is being
[1:20:11] before the the
[1:20:13] uh 62 brother around basically taught
[1:20:17] basically that it's Body Soul
[1:20:21] Spirit then after the then after 62 when
[1:20:24] the greatest battle ever fought he
[1:20:26] taught Body Spirit and
[1:20:29] soul we'll go through that cuz I've been
[1:20:32] over that and over that for 40 years but
[1:20:36] see just take whatever the realm is the
[1:20:39] body has five senses CJ feel smell here
[1:20:42] Spirit has memory reason constant
[1:20:44] affection Love Etc the soul only has one
[1:20:47] sense is either Faith or now right
[1:20:49] that's
[1:20:51] right you see I didn't believe your soul
[1:20:54] had any
[1:20:57] feelings that it was the essence of
[1:21:01] love but there would be no imagination
[1:21:03] memory reason I went back one day and
[1:21:05] read where the Prophet went beyond the
[1:21:07] curtain of time he said they had their
[1:21:09] senses said well Lord I got to go to the
[1:21:12] church and tell them I was wrong
[1:21:14] y so I came up here and told you where
[1:21:18] WR
[1:21:19] that cuz I couldn't see the soul had to
[1:21:22] sense just like that but even the
[1:21:26] Dead come on that's right he's saying
[1:21:30] send somebody back up there to talk to
[1:21:32] them people he still got his feelings
[1:21:35] cuz that's the soul of the
[1:21:37] man
[1:21:38] right go back
[1:21:40] over now your spirit we'll get to it
[1:21:44] after while what know
[1:21:46] this I'm going to quit on this
[1:21:49] club we'll get back to it where the
[1:21:52] Bible says your spirit goes back to God
[1:21:54] who gave your body goes to the Grave
[1:21:56] your spirit goes back to God Soul goes
[1:21:59] under the altar all right now but the
[1:22:03] main thing I'm trying to get you to see
[1:22:06] and that kind of a body the soul which a
[1:22:08] body that does not what have to eat and
[1:22:11] so forth when he's beyond the curtain of
[1:22:12] time he didn't eat huh now look at the
[1:22:16] scripture is if the Earth Earthly
[1:22:19] Tabernacle be dissolved we have one
[1:22:21] waiting what is that
[1:22:23] there is a Celestial body there is a
[1:22:26] terrestrial body the celestial body is a
[1:22:29] Heavenly Body right even the sinner has
[1:22:33] a soul right y why because he's not just
[1:22:37] an
[1:22:38] animal p all we have one way a Celestial
[1:22:41] body and with that spirit and that soul
[1:22:44] and Celestial body you raise again this
[1:22:47] natural body for that great Millennium
[1:22:49] right what is the soul of an individual
[1:22:53] it's a
[1:22:54] being it's what you are right amen it's
[1:22:57] more real than your body right it's more
[1:23:00] real than your spirit
[1:23:03] y it's the thing that God is working on
[1:23:07] right amen I'm
[1:23:09] quoting and he never changed from his
[1:23:11] early Ministry when he said the soul is
[1:23:13] the nature of the spirit
[1:23:15] right and changed that over in after he
[1:23:19] the opening of the seals he still was
[1:23:20] believing it the soul is the name
[1:23:22] through the spirit cuz it
[1:23:26] is if the Holy Spirit comes and lives in
[1:23:29] our heart by the new
[1:23:31] birth would not that be our nature amen
[1:23:35] right
[1:23:36] amen right because it's the nature of
[1:23:39] the spirit and the nature of the holy
[1:23:42] spirit is to live right and do
[1:23:47] right it's that I told him last night
[1:23:50] maybe I shouldn't say things blunt but
[1:23:53] there's people in this message that I
[1:23:55] know of and some of you know of them
[1:23:57] that they actually have had fights in
[1:23:59] churches physical
[1:24:02] fights over
[1:24:04] doctrines now you think I'm going to
[1:24:06] fool with that kind of people I ain't
[1:24:08] going back you start one now we going to
[1:24:11] get the law and you going out of here
[1:24:13] and you ain't coming back I will
[1:24:18] fight not physically but I'll sure
[1:24:20] borrow the doors
[1:24:23] because there's no such thing in
[1:24:24] Christianity
[1:24:26] that could have anything to do with
[1:24:28] physical
[1:24:34] fighting I thought we supposed to turn
[1:24:36] the other
[1:24:38] cheek but what is the soul we'll get
[1:24:40] back on it this afternoon the soul is
[1:24:42] the real you the soul is the part of you
[1:24:44] that lives on after
[1:24:47] death it's more real than this physical
[1:24:49] body you're looking at brother R said
[1:24:51] you never seen the real man
[1:24:52] right amen he said you see the body I'm
[1:24:57] inhabited Jesus gave his
[1:25:02] soul
[1:25:05] remember the spirit left him in the
[1:25:08] garden and even on the cross he said
[1:25:10] into thy hands I commend my
[1:25:15] spirit but his soul went to hell for you
[1:25:17] and
[1:25:18] I brother R said he sent his soul back
[1:25:21] in the form of the baptism of the Holy
[1:25:23] Ghost to come and live in every being in
[1:25:25] the world by the new birth they will
[1:25:28] accept
[1:25:30] it so what is a
[1:25:34] soul give you a quote where brother R
[1:25:37] said it's the mind of Christ in
[1:25:43] you what about your
[1:25:45] soul see David didn't cry out my spirit
[1:25:50] longth after thee m
[1:25:55] he said my
[1:25:59] soul Jesus said my soul is
[1:26:10] troubled what about it what is a
[1:26:13] soul come on
[1:26:15] Brothers sorry about taking too much
[1:26:17] time this morning I'm not nearly 12
[1:26:21] now but see I just want you to realize
[1:26:24] one
[1:26:27] thing salvation is not in your body it
[1:26:30] is not in your
[1:26:31] spirit you can be anointed every day of
[1:26:34] your life and die and go to
[1:26:37] hell salvation of the soul is eternal
[1:26:40] life
[1:26:43] amen a Redemptive plan I hope you caught
[1:26:46] that that even that fifth seal Jew's got
[1:26:49] to have a Redemptive plan it is the
[1:26:51] blood of Jesus Christ but not applied to
[1:26:55] them to bring them to a new birth
[1:26:58] right even the 144,000 don't come to a
[1:27:03] right Born Again believer in the body of
[1:27:08] Christ but they get eternal life
[1:27:11] right that F sealed Jew will get eternal
[1:27:15] life no wonder Paul was so happy when he
[1:27:18] said all Israel will be saved
[1:27:22] maybe God just opened his eyes just a
[1:27:24] little bit and let him see that right
[1:27:26] close it right back
[1:27:29] up he blinded them for you and I what I
[1:27:32] got let's Stand Together 597 in power
