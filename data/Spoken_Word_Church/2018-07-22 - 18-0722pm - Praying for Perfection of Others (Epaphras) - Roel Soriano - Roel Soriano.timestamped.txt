[29:06] see
[29:12] I'm lookin say it's good to be in the
[29:15] house of the Lord David said I was glad
[29:18] when they said unto me let us go to the
[29:20] house of the Lord sure been a pleasure
[29:23] to be in fellowship once again with you
[29:25] and to feel the Welcome spirit and the
[29:29] love that you've shown our way thank you
[29:47] I hate it when they tie up the minister
[29:52] like this amen and I'm sure enjoy enjoy
[30:02] the word this morning praise the Lord
[30:08] we'll let you be seated for just a
[30:10] little bit I just felt that you know
[30:16] some of the Brethren they suggested that
[30:18] I show the pictures I made a slide
[30:22] presentation and they suggested that I
[30:25] showed them to the congregation because
[30:28] this dis church has been helping us in
[30:30] the missions you know I really believe
[30:33] that a church that is mission minded is
[30:35] a growing church not the church that's
[30:43] maybe the most number of members in the
[30:47] assembly not the church that has the
[30:50] most money in the bank but the church
[30:54] that is involved in mission that well
[30:57] said if you do missions you're in the
[31:00] center of God wheels God's will
[31:02] amen so just few slats that I want to
[31:07] share with you this afternoon
[31:16] yeah well throughout out the year since
[31:19] we started holding the message
[31:22] presentation seminars which we call mr.
[31:25] Expo seminars in 2000 year 2000 we
[31:29] started doing it I can think of at least
[31:34] a hundred denominational congregations
[31:39] that have been led to the message go to
[31:41] God
[31:44] and just in the last two weeks that's
[31:50] before we came over we have been
[31:54] deceiving updates reports from
[31:56] evangelists but a little solo and the
[31:59] others of whole congregations there's a
[32:05] wave of Baptists and taking place now to
[32:09] the point that better by the way the
[32:12] things that by the solos turned into a
[32:18] it's like a fish now because it's always
[32:20] in the water so praise God so over the
[32:26] years we let a lot of church churches to
[32:28] the message but now it's time to get
[32:30] them established in the word and we're
[32:32] in the process of doing that at least
[32:34] next night we read in the book of Acts
[32:39] chapter 16 verse 5 and so a word the
[32:43] church established in the faith and
[32:45] increased in number daily are we not
[32:51] writing a book of Acts again in our day
[32:54] and then brother branham's desire
[32:57] express it to the insync taking side
[33:00] with Jesus he said get training in your
[33:03] own groups other ministers men that you
[33:08] see that has a calling in their life for
[33:10] the ministry we don't believe in Bible
[33:13] School but we'll even we believe in
[33:14] training
[33:16] training in the message and we train the
[33:19] ones that we already know God has a call
[33:23] in their lives
[33:25] amen huh we don't believe in mama called
[33:28] Papa sent preachers and Bertram said
[33:34] train them young men and bring them here
[33:37] to the elder we're thankful for the
[33:40] elder here
[33:41] I mean medicine which I considered to be
[33:47] my elder and this is what's been
[33:50] happening in our country next slide and
[33:54] it said but Wemmick's expressed this and
[33:59] a church of this faith can be set there
[34:02] and which will be an outpost in India
[34:05] outpost in Germany outpost in
[34:08] Switzerland why right now we should have
[34:11] had them all around the nations where
[34:13] I've been and the message then from
[34:17] there comes to another from another
[34:20] comes another see what I mean he was he
[34:26] was trying to show us how the message
[34:29] would grow and it it's happened all over
[34:33] the world now and it's happening in in a
[34:37] small waste ball away in the Philippines
[34:39] now because different regions in our
[34:41] countries message message churches are
[34:45] sprouting from different denominational
[34:48] groups they they come out of their
[34:50] denominations and received a message
[34:53] next slide please and these are the main
[34:56] men that worked with me I listed the
[34:59] names there I could not do it alone
[35:03] you know brother but a Paget called me a
[35:08] young preacher yesterday I'm not really
[35:12] that young I'm almost 60 year old see
[35:16] the gray hairs and I have health
[35:21] problems and I argue meet with my wives
[35:26] sometimes you know because he doesn't
[35:29] want me to go into hard places no but I
[35:32] just couldn't turn down the invitation
[35:35] this the Lord opens the door and I
[35:41] believe God makes a way for us to open
[35:43] the teeth to enter the game and but I
[35:48] thank God for this young brothers other
[35:50] brothers that have burdened and they
[35:52] have the same vision to propagate the
[35:54] word and see these churches get
[35:56] stablishing
[35:57] in the world next and we saw the other
[36:01] ministers I would say right now I can
[36:06] think of at least 100 ministers that
[36:09] work with me in the missions even next
[36:16] so this is one of the churches in
[36:18] southern the guard Tagalog region one of
[36:22] the biggest church there there are about
[36:26] a dozen churches in the region now and
[36:29] what we did we hold the joint meetings
[36:33] like but we had yesterday in every
[36:35] region of our country we kind of
[36:37] regionalized the fellowship to encourage
[36:41] the churches next and this one is in
[36:44] Nueva Ecija that's a northern part of
[36:47] the zone this is a property it's a four
[36:52] acre property that's been donated to the
[36:55] work of the Lord and you see the blue
[37:01] buildings there those are accommodation
[37:04] houses for the campers the delegates
[37:07] that will come and attend the meetings
[37:08] and the believers are helping out to
[37:14] build this compound here so that we can
[37:17] have a place up north to hold the
[37:20] fellowship meetings and the conventions
[37:23] in our current in that in that part of
[37:25] the country next see brother Edward
[37:32] Seaga Malian a better way met him and
[37:37] his wife but the Edward was a Dean
[37:42] by Bisco when he heard the message and
[37:45] he readily accepted the message and got
[37:49] got kicked out by in this denomination
[37:53] kicked out of the church kick out of
[37:55] their home yeah
[37:57] so we had to hurriedly build him a small
[38:02] house so they can move to a place they
[38:06] are holding a Bible here that was done
[38:09] published by the new tribes mission is
[38:12] an American mission group what they do
[38:15] is they go to a certain remote area
[38:18] tribal areas where the tribes are and
[38:21] they stay for extended amount of time to
[38:26] be able to learn the dialect in order
[38:29] for them to translate the Bible in that
[38:32] dialect and in our country there's at
[38:36] least at least a hundred dialects
[38:39] regional dialects and they don't have
[38:42] access to Bibles they don't have Bibles
[38:45] translated in their own dialects but we
[38:48] thank God for the new tribes mission and
[38:50] brother Edward has gotten in touch with
[38:53] them and we can buy these Bibles for
[38:55] only $2 apiece there amen so we bought a
[39:03] bunch of them and distributed them to
[39:05] the tribes people we just bought a small
[39:09] amount or Bibles because not very few
[39:12] could read in those tribes you know
[39:15] there's very little literacy amongst
[39:19] them but this COPO is helping the tribes
[39:23] of southern southern polite
[39:25] allowing next these are tribal people
[39:32] you can see their you know darker
[39:34] skinned and to reach this place you have
[39:40] to walk 13 hours it's up in the mountain
[39:45] there's no other way to get there but to
[39:47] all next
[39:51] it's better by the edward holding youth
[39:56] meetings next and baptizing some young
[40:01] people next and other new converts in
[40:06] the message next how 2 years ago we gave
[40:11] him this motorbike but now it's broken
[40:17] he took it to the mechanic and the
[40:20] mechanic told him the sad news that he
[40:23] can't do nothing about it
[40:24] can't get it to work anymore you know so
[40:27] you just have to give him another one
[40:29] next by the edward helps build this
[40:35] tribal churches you know the lumber is
[40:40] readily available in this areas and
[40:43] sometimes all they ask is help to buy
[40:46] nails they don't have to buy the lumber
[40:49] but they need nails and i think we
[40:53] helped a couple a couple of churches by
[40:56] nails through this church next you
[41:01] believers being baptized in water these
[41:04] are new churches being established in
[41:06] the jungle their areas of southern
[41:08] allowance
[41:09] next this is the typical tribal church
[41:13] service see the dirt the dirt floor and
[41:17] the benches that's very typical in those
[41:21] areas and brother-and-sister press nelio
[41:24] lead new churches like this like this
[41:27] one in melaka laka it's a place in
[41:30] al-assad in Halawa next here's another

[41:37] McDonald mainly unreached tribe of the
[41:43] tower power talk about bateau tribe
[41:46] tower but both times are to announce it
[41:48] but yeah it's it's hard to reach their
[41:53] people because you know having to walk
[41:55] 13 hours with your place next this is
[42:01] the training that we do amongst the
[42:02] it--is you know itís a little
[42:05] pygmies they look like Africans but

[42:13] and they come to our church and stay
[42:19] there for about a week and we do
[42:20] extensive training and teach them about

[44:55] the funds that we used to build this
[44:57] church came from this assembly right
[45:00] here we originally planned to build a
[45:05] smaller Church but migration of 1,000
[45:09] families into this new village prompted
[45:11] us to build bigger we faced challenges
[45:16] in building this church now number one
[45:20] is a persecution that the workers there
[45:23] get from the denominational churches you
[45:29] know in the beginning when we started
[45:30] out there were they were very willing to
[45:33] cooperate with us in evangelizing the
[45:35] area but when we started building this
[45:38] church they thought we were a big
[45:40] denomination you know Oh getting a lot
[45:44] of a big big support they they don't
[45:48] know what we are but praise God they
[45:53] they became so insecured and so they
[45:56] they met together and came against the
[45:59] message that they are they are fighting
[46:01] our workers there they actually put a
[46:03] stop to the construction of the building
[46:06] they the politicians they talk to them
[46:13] so that the construction will be stopped
[46:16] on the 27th of the month there's a
[46:19] meeting scheduled and our evangelists
[46:24] from our church will be attending and
[46:26] they're gonna be they're going to have a
[46:28] meeting to justified
[46:32] the continuance of the construction of
[46:35] this church so you help them in your
[46:38] prayers pray for them next yeah this
[46:47] this is not glacier
[46:50] this is lahar which is mudflow volcanic
[46:57] ass that came out of the mountain so
[47:02] this is brother hey soos now one of our
[47:05] evangelists and they they traveled to
[47:09] displace us to preach the gospel next
[47:16] this is the kind of road that we
[47:18] negotiate going to the area next this is
[47:23] an ayah chirps used to be Presbyterian
[47:28] church but they every one of them
[47:30] receive baptism in the name of Jesus
[47:32] Christ and they're now in the Messick's
[47:35] amen that's the pastor there to the
[47:37] right
[47:38] connects this is an evangelist from our
[47:43] church by the Gabriele oxalis and it's
[47:46] the recipient of one of the motorcycles
[47:47] that was donated by brother here amen
[47:51] thank the Lord for that so he does a lot
[47:57] of teaching for our aya brethren next
[48:03] yeah this evangelistic goose who got an
[48:07] his name is Jesus Isuzu garden and it
[48:13] travels with brother a bang all the time
[48:15] he helps brother Gabriele in reaching
[48:17] out to eight itis brothers to the eye
[48:20] test brother Gabriele and blood races
[48:22] work in remote areas to some ballast to
[48:24] start new works in the message next now
[48:30] this is a church that I started years
[48:32] ago in the 90s in Mindanao it's a place
[48:35] called char Gow Island it's a tourist
[48:38] island actually and in spite of the mark
[48:41] Marshall rule in the island that's
[48:45] one third of the country it's about one
[48:47] third of the country under marshal rule
[48:50] now because there was a a war worse that
[48:56] place against us in Chi Chi morale we
[49:00] Morales City and there were a lot of
[49:04] Isis elements that are roaming around
[49:07] the area making recruits amongst the
[49:10] Muslim community and so the president
[49:13] declared martial law in this part of our
[49:16] country but in spite of the marshal rule
[49:19] this church which I pioneered in the 90s
[49:22] continued to grow next now this is
[49:28] another Church that I helped start in
[49:32] Dubai its Church in Dubai there are more
[49:37] members in that assembly now over 100
[49:41] people now in that assembly made up of
[49:48] 120 members from different nations of
[49:50] the world and there is a smaller
[49:54] all-filipino Church in the city there
[49:56] are two churches now in Dubai think
[50:00] about it Dubai is it's just separated by
[50:06] the border into Israel so I'm thinking
[50:11] this church now is represented by many
[50:14] nations of the world the Bible said this
[50:18] gospel of the kingdom will be preached
[50:20] in all the game in all the world and
[50:23] then the end shall come so after the
[50:27] Gentiles then it would go back to Israel
[50:30] again next now this is the wave of a
[50:35] baptism that by the liter so low but the
[50:37] litter so low is this brother here but a
[50:41] fish so it's in the water
[50:46] this is imbecilic City Mindanao this
[50:50] Assemblies of God Church received the
[50:52] baptism in Jesus name
[50:53] after a series of meetings conducted in
[50:56] their church in surah Gao su
[50:58] Mindanao huh amen
[51:01] I think we should press a lot for this
[51:05] next
[51:09] now all these ministers were giving them
[51:13] tablets these are cheap tablets P buying
[51:17] the Philippines made in China
[51:19] everything's made a child
[51:24] somebody somebody says a minister I
[51:27] heard himself in the beginning God
[51:29] created the heavens and the earth and
[51:30] the rest is made in China but at least
[51:39] they have a tool that they can use to
[51:41] study the message and they're happy
[51:43] about it you know this ministers they
[51:46] attended the last mr. Expo seminar that
[51:49] but a little solo standing on the right
[51:52] there conducted in mystic city Mindanao
[51:56] 15 of them received baptism in the name
[51:59] of the Lord Jesus Christ and they went
[52:04] back to their congregation and talked to
[52:06] them about the message and we've been
[52:07] receiving updates that their
[52:10] congregation are ready to receive
[52:11] baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus

[52:39] place brother Molina has started over 60
[52:42] churches this brother here started 60
[52:44] churches in the Pentecostal denomination
[52:49] but but then by delito is relative to
[52:55] Belle Alito a cousin shared the message
[52:58] to him and he got gladly accepted the
[53:02] message and now what we're doing is
[53:04] we're taking the rounds going to this to
[53:07] this 60 churches that he has started and
[53:10] presenting the message to each
[53:16] what happened let me tell you as a short
[53:18] testimony about this brother money now
[53:20] let me know huh the minute the
[53:24] Assemblies of God got got wind got wind
[53:28] that but the money now is now preaching
[53:31] another doctrine the message of the hour
[53:34] he was called to a meeting and he was
[53:36] scolded in he was humiliated insulted
[53:39] before the people and the purpose of
[53:43] course was so the people will stay away
[53:47] from him and not listen to his teachings
[53:50] but what they did backfired on them
[53:54] because all these people now sympathized
[53:57] with his brother bail money now and they
[54:00] want to know what he believes so praise
[54:05] the Lord next yeah another group that

[55:55] so when ministers come and piece for us
[55:58] I have to caution them but not to say
[56:01] brothers and sisters if there's no
[56:03] brothers all sisters to see but but
[56:10] there are strong witness for the message
[56:12] of the hour
[56:13] amen this church has become a
[56:16] springboard in reaching countries in
[56:18] Southeast Asia like Singapore Malaysia
[56:20] China Macau Vietnam in Japan next this
[56:27] is our December camp meetings have you
[56:31] been to our meetings better wait no

[57:15] church next concrete yes concrete and
[57:21] well sometimes they use a mat sometimes
[57:30] we use every space available for the
[57:32] campers to sleep next
[57:36] so we built this section in our
[57:40] fellowship area which was used last year
[57:45] by fifty-fifty believers to sleep on
[57:49] they slept on that register that we
[57:52] built next and this is a brother that
[57:58] builds guitars so what what I do I
[58:02] financed him you know by the material so
[58:06] we can build the guitars and we give the
[58:09] guitars away to the new churches that
[58:12] need them you know this brother's name
[58:15] is better cities Mendez from the island
[58:18] of coram palawan he's making guitars for
[58:21] brethren we gave out 40 guitars to new
[58:24] churches this year glory to God amen

[58:56] per piece and so we thank the Lord for
[59:01] all these open doors in our classes it's
[59:08] beyond me you know I don't know how we
[59:11] are able to cope this ministering and
[59:14] helping this little churches in our
[59:16] country that recently visit the message
[59:20] thank you
[59:27] thank you Jesus
[59:30] now that didn't take too long well that
[59:38] took away from the message this
[59:40] afternoon that's all right
[59:44] amen I'm going to Minister about a
[59:53] subject which I call praying for
[59:57] perfection of others it's interesting
[1:00:03] that Paul made mention of a co-worker in
[1:00:07] the Lord whose name is Epirus we'll go
[1:00:13] to it in the next slide cloche in
[1:00:18] chapter 1 verse 7 to 13 I believe a
[1:00:22] paparazzi represent the bride of Jesus
[1:00:25] Christ you will find out data why in
[1:00:32] verse 7 to st. Paul writing to the
[1:00:37] Saints in Colossus he said as she also
[1:00:42] learned of apparatus our dear fellow
[1:00:45] servant servant who is who is for you a
[1:00:50] faithful minister of Christ Paul called
[1:00:55] him a faithful minister of Christ
[1:00:58] who also declared and to ask them and to
[1:01:03] us your love in the spirit now listen
[1:01:07] this is all he did Epirus he declared to
[1:01:12] st. Paul and the others the love that
[1:01:15] the collusion people have in the spirit
[1:01:19] and look at that the effect of it on st.
[1:01:23] Paul verse verse 9 for this cause
[1:01:26] because of this report because of what
[1:01:29] he did for this cause we also since the
[1:01:33] day we heard of it do not cease to pray
[1:01:37] for you
[1:01:38] this is the effect of what a purpose did
[1:01:41] we do not cease to pray for you and to
[1:01:45] decide that you might be filled with
[1:01:47] knowledge of his will in all wisdom and
[1:01:51] spiritual understanding that you might
[1:01:54] walk worthy of the Lord and to all
[1:01:57] pleasing being fruitful in every good
[1:02:00] work and increasing in the knowledge of
[1:02:03] God strengthened with all mine according
[1:02:08] to his glorious power and unto all
[1:02:11] patience and long-suffering with
[1:02:13] joyfulness giving thanks unto the father
[1:02:16] which has made us meet to be partakers
[1:02:19] of the inheritance of the Saints in life
[1:02:23] who had delivered us from the power of
[1:02:26] darkness and hath translated us into the
[1:02:29] kingdom of his dear son
[1:02:32] this little report prompted st. Paul to
[1:02:38] do all this for the Saints in colossal
[1:02:42] amen what a wonderful ministry this is
[1:02:45] in Colossians chapter 4 and verse 12
[1:02:49] Paul said about a paparazzi paparazzi
[1:02:56] who is one of you it's a believer like
[1:03:00] just like one of you and said a servant
[1:03:04] of Christ I just want to be called a
[1:03:09] servant of Christ salute you always and
[1:03:15] what did he do he said always laboring
[1:03:19] fervently for you in prayers this was
[1:03:24] what I professed did laboring fervently
[1:03:28] for you in purse that ye may stand
[1:03:32] perfect and complete in the will of God
[1:03:36] oh my what a ministry to be able to
[1:03:44] labor and have that burden for the
[1:03:47] people that maybe are new in the faith
[1:03:50] or maybe
[1:03:51] weak in the faith or maybe are facing
[1:03:54] all kinds of challenges in their
[1:03:56] spiritual walk but it doesn't condemn
[1:03:59] them it doesn't look down on them but
[1:04:01] instead he Labor's hard in praying for
[1:04:05] these people so that they can come to
[1:04:07] perfection oh my what a wonderful
[1:04:12] ministry a lot of times we think of our
[1:04:15] own perfection you know this morning we
[1:04:20] had a great time we understand that we
[1:04:23] can rest in the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:04:25] because we are perfect in him right and
[1:04:27] better Brennan was caught behind the
[1:04:30] curtain of time he was told that nothing
[1:04:33] short of perfection can come in there
[1:04:36] hallelujah
[1:04:38] therefore you and I need to be perfected
[1:04:44] in order to be in the rapture you know
[1:04:47] in order to be in that dimension we're
[1:04:50] better been was caught up in hallelujah
[1:04:54] but a lot of times we we tend to be more
[1:05:03] individualistic so to speak in our walk
[1:05:08] with the Lord you know it's like to each
[1:05:10] his own we think of our own spiritual
[1:05:13] welfare we don't think so much of the
[1:05:16] other people's welfare and their
[1:05:19] progress spiritual progress in the Lord
[1:05:22] but I think a pop press here showed us a
[1:05:28] very good example because it doesn't
[1:05:31] think of just his own perfection he
[1:05:34] labels a lot he prays a lot he was
[1:05:37] burdened for the people that needed to
[1:05:40] progress in their walk with God
[1:05:42] hallelujah amen
[1:05:44] I believe we should all do that I
[1:05:47] believe this this this is the mission of
[1:05:50] the bride now to help one another lift
[1:05:56] one another up amen help one another in
[1:06:00] prayer because you need to be perfect to
[1:06:04] get there
[1:06:05] I need to be perfect to get there which
[1:06:10] means you have to help me out hallelujah
[1:06:13] because even though you reach perfection
[1:06:16] and I don't and I'm part of the body of
[1:06:19] Christ as well as you are there's no
[1:06:22] rupture you're not going anywhere you're
[1:06:26] not going until I'm perfect so you might
[1:06:29] as well pay for my perfection and I can
[1:06:39] pray for your perfection hallelujah
[1:06:44] thank God for a preposterous use the
[1:06:50] meaning of the name Epirus the meaning
[1:06:54] of the name is actually lovely isn't the
[1:06:59] bright lovely the body of Jesus got the
[1:07:02] beautiful bride of Jesus Christ
[1:07:04] hallelujah it is actually a biblical
[1:07:09] baby name believe it or not mother's
[1:07:15] name their babies a papayas and it has
[1:07:21] this meaning it has the meaning covered
[1:07:25] with foam yep a press means covered with
[1:07:29] foam and I think of baby proofing a room
[1:07:33] or a house you know what we baby-proof
[1:07:38] the house we cover everything with foam
[1:07:42] so the baby will not get hurt so a bad
[1:07:47] price is somebody that's covered with
[1:07:49] foam meaning he's not sticky meaning he
[1:07:56] doesn't hurt anybody I mean it's not an
[1:07:59] offensive person but he's a gentleman he
[1:08:05] brings the word in the spirit of love
[1:08:08] and in wisdom he's a gentle man covered
[1:08:13] with foam foam pop press also means she
[1:08:16] knows
[1:08:18] a pop I mean she knows and later we're
[1:08:23] gonna coat brother banner were better
[1:08:25] BAM said she knows what needs to be done
[1:08:29] with the word the bride knows hallelujah
[1:08:35] you see we tend to be individualistic in
[1:08:38] our walk with God
[1:08:39] but no man is an island we need other
[1:08:44] people to help us attain perfection even
[1:08:50] the ones that are seemingly in
[1:08:54] their walk with God you need them so
[1:09:01] that your faith can be perfected so it's
[1:09:08] a challenge to be an a professor to see
[1:09:12] other people's desire for perfection and
[1:09:15] labor impair that others may attain it
[1:09:19] it's not an easy job because Satan will
[1:09:23] try to derail your every effort to help
[1:09:27] another it is a lot easier to be selfish
[1:09:33] and think of your own spiritual growth
[1:09:37] and perfection it's easy to do that like
[1:09:42] if we're honest you know when we pray
[1:09:44] and take the percentage of our prayers
[1:09:48] where we pray for our own needs we spend
[1:09:54] a lot of time praying for our own needs
[1:09:57] it's about time you pray for others also
[1:10:01] hallelujah now the reality is you can't
[1:10:07] make it without me well would you like
[1:10:13] to shake hands with your neighbor there
[1:10:15] and say you can't make it without me you
[1:10:19] can't make it without me
[1:10:27] - well pray for me pray for my
[1:10:32] perfection hallelujah
[1:10:36] because Bertram said the bride will be a
[1:10:40] complete body he knows exactly who will
[1:10:46] make up the bride of Jesus Christ and it
[1:10:49] will be a complete body he said there is
[1:10:51] nobody can add anything to it or take
[1:10:54] any from it if you would it would be a
[1:10:57] freak body of God if there's something
[1:11:01] extra or something lacking it would be a
[1:11:03] freak body for God of God it would have
[1:11:07] maybe like six fingers of one hand on
[1:11:10] one hand and three arms or something to
[1:11:13] add something or take something away
[1:11:14] from it and be one arm short or one
[1:11:18] finger short but it's the complete body
[1:11:20] of Jesus Christ and in Christ being the
[1:11:24] male the groom the bride is represented
[1:11:27] in him also and this to our one Christ
[1:11:32] and the bride they are one Christ as a
[1:11:37] body he lives in his body and that's us
[1:11:40] we are the body of Jesus Christ now amen
[1:11:45] we are we are the mouth the speaks his
[1:11:48] word we are the feet that brings the
[1:11:51] gospel to the people hallelujah
[1:11:53] we are the Word made flesh today his
[1:11:58] amen
[1:12:00] hallelujah it means the bride will not
[1:12:06] be complete without you whereupon we
[1:12:08] even said God is that complete without
[1:12:11] you you're special nobody can take your
[1:12:17] place you know the nose cannot decide
[1:12:20] that I'm not a part of the body because
[1:12:23] I cannot see no the nose is needed
[1:12:26] it's got a different purpose every one
[1:12:29] of us they we have a different purpose
[1:12:32] different ministry to accomplish in the
[1:12:35] body of Christ hallelujah were all
[1:12:37] needed it's a complete body we need to
[1:12:44] have the mind that the mind of price in
[1:12:48] Philippians chapter oh that fat chapter
[1:12:50] - that's my favorite chapter in the
[1:12:55] Bible because it says let this mind be
[1:13:01] in you which was in Christ why because
[1:13:05] he left his glory in heaven and became a
[1:13:09] servant hallelujah in verse 4 it says
[1:13:14] look not every man on his own things but
[1:13:17] every man on the things of others what
[1:13:22] what is this verse telling us it's
[1:13:26] telling us to put the needs of others
[1:13:28] before ours our own needs
[1:13:31] when you pray spend more time praying
[1:13:35] for other people's needs hallelujah
[1:13:38] I heard a sunday-school teacher say when
[1:13:43] I was a child attending a Sunday School
[1:13:45] in church no real joy is to put yourself
[1:13:50] last and Jesus first and the others in
[1:13:56] between that's Jay or why put yourself
[1:14:00] last Jesus first and the others in
[1:14:04] between
[1:14:06] let this mind be in you which was in
[1:14:09] Christ Jesus hallelujah in 2nd
[1:14:13] Corinthians chapter 13 verse 9 for we
[1:14:18] are glad when we are weak and you are
[1:14:21] strong this was Paul speaking on behalf
[1:14:24] of the ministry but we may be weak but
[1:14:28] that's alright as long as you are strong
[1:14:31] and this also we wish Paul is wishing
[1:14:36] your perfection you see Paul was not
[1:14:41] desiring his own perfection there's
[1:14:45] nowhere in the Bible he says I desire my
[1:14:49] own perfection but he wishes the
[1:14:51] perfection of others and I believe but a
[1:14:54] better deal that this is the purpose of
[1:14:57] ministry is to help the people of God
[1:15:00] amen got to where they ought to be get
[1:15:05] to their proper place in the body of
[1:15:08] Christ amen
[1:15:09] help them mature amen do the best that
[1:15:12] we can to to minister to them so that
[1:15:16] they can progress in their walk with God
[1:15:19] hallelujah
[1:15:20] better Bentham said you know once you
[1:15:23] lose the feeling for the people it's
[1:15:27] time to leave the ministry what's the
[1:15:30] purpose if you cannot sympathize with
[1:15:32] the people if you don't have that desire
[1:15:35] to be able to help other people not help
[1:15:38] yourself but help other people
[1:15:40] hallelujah when you belong to an
[1:15:44] assembly or a church you can't help but
[1:15:47] be engaged because the church is a
[1:15:52] community of believers a corporal body
[1:15:58] enjoying corporal grace there's grace
[1:16:03] for everyone hallelujah and if you are
[1:16:07] involved in other people's lives it
[1:16:09] becomes natural to be concerned and help
[1:16:13] in any way you could and what better way
[1:16:16] to help others done by praying for them
[1:16:22] Birnbaum says eternal life is living for
[1:16:25] others the first thing I want to say is
[1:16:29] Jesus never lived for himself his life
[1:16:32] was spent for others
[1:16:36] that's perfectly eternal life this is
[1:16:40] how brother Branham defined eternal life
[1:16:42] when you say you go to church and you do
[1:16:46] good things that's fine but when you
[1:16:48] live your life to yourself you haven't
[1:16:50] got eternal life eternal life is living
[1:16:55] for others I say amen to that
[1:17:00] it proved it when it came in the when it
[1:17:04] come in the Lamb of God he lived and had
[1:17:07] eternal life because he did not live for
[1:17:10] himself he lived for others and you
[1:17:14] receive eternal life by receiving that
[1:17:16] day and you don't live for yourself no
[1:17:19] more you live for others once you
[1:17:24] receive eternal life you start living
[1:17:28] your life to benefit other people
[1:17:32] hallelujah you become a minister
[1:17:35] a minister is nothing but a servant
[1:17:39] hallelujah and our example is the Lord
[1:17:43] Jesus as much a 20 verse 28 says there
[1:17:46] even as the son of man came not to be
[1:17:49] ministered unto but to minister listen
[1:17:53] and to give his life a ransom for many
[1:17:57] that's our example ministers and laity
[1:18:02] alike that's our example hallelujah
[1:18:05] that's why John 3:16 says for God so
[1:18:08] loved the world he gave His only
[1:18:10] begotten Son that whosoever believeth in
[1:18:13] him will not perish but have everlasting
[1:18:14] life that's John 3:16 now our part is
[1:18:19] first John 3:16 first John 3:16 says
[1:18:23] hereby perceive we the love of God
[1:18:26] because he laid down his life for us and
[1:18:29] we ought to lay down our
[1:18:33] lives for the Brethren living for others
[1:18:38] hallelujah he lay down his life for us
[1:18:43] we owe it to him to lay down our life
[1:18:46] for our brethren hallelujah brother
[1:18:50] Branham said this is the secret of my
[1:18:52] success he mentioned the success of
[1:18:55] Billy Graham he said it was prayer
[1:18:58] people paid for Billy Graham that's why
[1:19:01] so many people come to his flock these
[1:19:03] meetings and he was able to go places
[1:19:06] and brother Brian said the same thing
[1:19:08] about himself he said when I first
[1:19:10] started with his claims here I told my
[1:19:13] church
[1:19:14] stay on your face and pray God begins to
[1:19:18] move first thing you know I heard calls
[1:19:21] coming from Africa from all over the
[1:19:24] world how did it get there I don't know
[1:19:27] he said prayer went up pray he says
[1:19:33] believe when you pray that's it believe
[1:19:38] this is what the Bride of Christ should
[1:19:41] be doing praying hallelujah even the
[1:19:45] prophet of God depended on the prayer of
[1:19:47] the people he knew he was helpless
[1:19:51] without the help of the prayer of the
[1:19:53] people hallelujah in the next slide
[1:19:59] first thing for life he said that's the
[1:20:02] success of my meetings he was
[1:20:04] attributing the success of his meetings
[1:20:06] into this it's because real godly people
[1:20:10] pray for me oh my Oprah passes we need
[1:20:16] them hallelujah real godly people pray
[1:20:19] for me that's it that's the recent
[1:20:23] success for the success in my meetings
[1:20:25] when I come in and introduce these
[1:20:28] things about the visions and things
[1:20:29] there's a many old mother and dad sister
[1:20:32] brother setting out there that believe
[1:20:35] that with all their heart and the Holy
[1:20:37] Spirit drops right down them then if
[1:20:40] they didn't do that I have no way of
[1:20:42] doing it
[1:20:43] no matter how great it would be for my
[1:20:46] so it has to be for you the same we have
[1:20:52] to do a unit two of us barbam said we
[1:20:57] have to do a unit together two of us
[1:21:01] together to make the contact with God he
[1:21:04] said you as a believer and myself as a
[1:21:08] believer I like that
[1:21:11] we're in this together hallelujah it's
[1:21:15] not just ministers you have a job to do
[1:21:20] the old sisters that maybe are retired
[1:21:24] and maybe are of just having health
[1:21:27] problems and they can go nowhere they
[1:21:30] have all the time in the world to pray
[1:21:32] amen
[1:21:34] all of us we have our proper place in
[1:21:38] the body of Christ hallelujah and in the
[1:21:45] same s message thirteen thirsting for
[1:21:47] life he said we need one another more
[1:21:50] now than we ever did meet each other is
[1:21:54] now when you get yourself singled out
[1:21:57] from the rest of them making yourself
[1:22:00] just a little different now listen
[1:22:03] better band saw this kind of attitude
[1:22:05] amongst believers when you get yourself
[1:22:07] singled out from the rest of them making
[1:22:10] yourself just a little different you
[1:22:12] don't want to associate with them
[1:22:14] because they believe this and don't want
[1:22:17] to associate with that you're getting on
[1:22:19] dangerous ground right then keeping away
[1:22:23] from charts hallelujah find the one of
[1:22:27] your choice meaning a church of your
[1:22:30] choice assembling where you can come and
[1:22:32] feed on the word and grow spiritually
[1:22:34] find the one of your choice and remain
[1:22:37] there be a Christian brother to all of
[1:22:40] them that's the way to be a Christian
[1:22:43] there we've got fellowship and Byram
[1:22:47] said protection people love you and pray
[1:22:51] for you
[1:22:52] they thank God for our assembly this is
[1:22:55] our protection
[1:22:57] amen the prayer of one another is our
[1:23:01] protection hallelujah that's the reason
[1:23:05] better Branham says when we
[1:23:07] disfellowshipped we take him out to the
[1:23:09] protection of the church we don't pray
[1:23:13] for him anymore
[1:23:15] we turn him over to the devil because
[1:23:18] fellowship assembly we thank God for
[1:23:21] this church because uh our fellowship
[1:23:24] with one another is our protection
[1:23:28] hallelujah I propose Paul called him a
[1:23:36] fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus of
[1:23:40] course you know what that means a
[1:23:42] prisoner is helpless he can't do
[1:23:45] anything but what the what you call it a
[1:23:49] warden warden tells him to do or allows
[1:23:53] him to do hallelujah we can't do
[1:23:57] anything but what the word Christ allows
[1:23:59] us to do and very Brown said that that
[1:24:05] day on Calvary it should become a second
[1:24:10] nature to us the unselfish life and self
[1:24:16] unselfish life should be should not be a
[1:24:19] second talk not to think about it but
[1:24:23] you are so dead to the things of this
[1:24:26] world and so alive in Christ and so
[1:24:29] walking in the highway that these things
[1:24:32] are just an automatic thing it becomes
[1:24:35] automatic to you to become selfless and
[1:24:39] think more of the needs of other people
[1:24:42] before your own needs you just do it not
[1:24:49] saying well now the Lord would the Lord
[1:24:52] want me to do that it's not that you're
[1:24:55] just part of him his Spirit is in you
[1:24:58] and you act the way he acted I do get it
[1:25:04] we discussed it this morning it's called
[1:25:07] divine nature it's just in you you don't
[1:25:12] have to manufacture it if the Spirit of
[1:25:14] God is in you it becomes a second nature
[1:25:16] to you and I usually gets a person's
[1:25:21] spirituality on his selfishness the more
[1:25:32] self is a person is the less spiritually
[1:25:37] progressively becomes the more matured
[1:25:40] you become in the Word of God the more
[1:25:44] selfless you become all right
[1:25:50] it becomes an automatic thing to put the
[1:25:54] needs of other people before your own
[1:25:56] needs
[1:25:57] hallelujah it becomes in the second
[1:25:59] nature to you now here's the code I was
[1:26:02] telling you about spoken words the
[1:26:04] original seed burner BAM said here is
[1:26:07] the secret the word is in the bride and
[1:26:11] the mind of Christ to know what he wants
[1:26:15] done be the word the meaning of the name
[1:26:19] upon us is she knows the bride knows
[1:26:25] because she's got the mind of Christ the
[1:26:28] word is in the bride and she's got the
[1:26:30] mind of Christ to know what he wants
[1:26:32] done be the word he don't have to be
[1:26:37] told by a deacon by the minister by the
[1:26:41] pastor he knows what to do with the Word
[1:26:44] of God
[1:26:45] hallelujah he has she has thus sayeth
[1:26:51] the Lord and then it is germanized so
[1:26:54] that the Holy Spirit water said until
[1:26:56] it's grown and it serves its purpose
[1:27:01] hallelujah were we should not be afraid
[1:27:06] to pray
[1:27:11] I should spend more time gray leather
[1:27:15] bottom said we can eat too much we can
[1:27:19] fellowship too much but we can never
[1:27:22] pray too much hallelujah
[1:27:26] Matthews chapter 7 verse 7 verse 7
[1:27:29] through 11 says ask and it shall be
[1:27:32] given to you 1 what a great motivation
[1:27:35] motivation to pray and you ask something
[1:27:38] of the Lord to be given to you seek and
[1:27:39] ye shall find knock and it shall be open
[1:27:42] to you for everyone that asketh
[1:27:44] receiveth and everyone that seeketh
[1:27:47] findeth and to him that knocketh it
[1:27:49] shall be opened or what man is there of
[1:27:53] you whom his son asked bread will he
[1:27:57] give him a stone or if he ask fish will
[1:28:01] he give him a serpent if ye then being
[1:28:04] evil know how to give good gifts unto
[1:28:06] your children how much more shall your
[1:28:09] father which is in heaven give you good
[1:28:11] things to them that ask him you see a
[1:28:15] brother that's maybe immature in his
[1:28:19] Christian life hallelujah you should ask
[1:28:23] in prayer for that brother to move on
[1:28:27] with the Lord amen to be - to go a step
[1:28:31] higher in his walk with Christ
[1:28:33] hallelujah and if you ask it in prayer
[1:28:37] you think God will give it to you it's
[1:28:41] the promise God will give it to you
[1:28:43] hallelujah
[1:28:45] we must ask in faith first John chapter
[1:28:49] 5 verse 14 and this is the confidence
[1:28:53] that we have in him that we if we ask
[1:28:55] anything according to his will he
[1:28:57] heareth us not only he asked and
[1:29:03] received not because she asked amiss
[1:29:06] that you may consume it upon your own
[1:29:09] lusts why do you ask amiss how come you
[1:29:15] ask amiss John James said so that you
[1:29:21] can consume it in your own lust
[1:29:24] you're only asking for your own needs
[1:29:30] what about the needs of others
[1:29:33] hallelujah you need to have the mind of
[1:29:36] Christ you need to know that there are
[1:29:39] other people that are there also part of
[1:29:41] the Bride of Christ but there they're
[1:29:44] not maybe in the same level as you are
[1:29:46] in the Lord and you can't ignore them
[1:29:51] you can't be indifferent to their needs
[1:29:53] you need to do the best that you can to
[1:29:56] help the brother or the sister because
[1:29:59] this is the mind of God this is what the
[1:30:02] bride should be doing you should know
[1:30:04] what needs to be done with the Word of
[1:30:06] God help team or frames here we're gonna
[1:30:14] read crisis the mystery I said don't
[1:30:18] despise a brother who who is a little
[1:30:21] wrong if the brother you think is a
[1:30:25] little wrong or the sisters say Lord let
[1:30:30] me never have a root of bitterness
[1:30:31] spring up because it will affect him and
[1:30:35] it will take Christ right out of my life
[1:30:39] that poison acids of malice jealousy and
[1:30:44] hatred that will just take the Holy
[1:30:47] Spirit right away from you it will run
[1:30:51] him run him from the Tabernacle here and
[1:30:53] it will kill the Spirit of God or drive
[1:30:56] it away from here hurt your pastor it
[1:31:00] will do everything see so don't do that
[1:31:10] the church in his condition bourbon was
[1:31:15] talking about an arrogant and hostile
[1:31:16] spirit I think all of us at one time we
[1:31:21] had this attitude we had this spirit
[1:31:25] I remember the time when we first
[1:31:28] conducted the expo back in 2000 and we
[1:31:34] were receiving very little response a
[1:31:38] lot of times no response at all and the
[1:31:42] response that we're getting was
[1:31:44] rejection because you know in the
[1:31:49] beginning I gained knowledge I gained a
[1:31:53] lot of mysteries knowledge of the truth
[1:31:56] in the Bible and I grew in knowledge but
[1:32:01] the Bible said you need to grow in grace
[1:32:05] and in the knowledge of the Lord Jesus
[1:32:09] Christ right knowledge should grow no
[1:32:14] grace should grow with knowledge
[1:32:17] hallelujah because but a lot of us we
[1:32:22] grew in knowledge but not in grace and
[1:32:28] in effect we became very self-righteous
[1:32:35] we have taken this attitude of holier
[1:32:40] than thou and we can't hide it from
[1:32:44] people you know we were trying to share
[1:32:47] the message to the denominational people
[1:32:50] and they could sense it that I feel
[1:32:56] superior to them you know I didn't even
[1:32:59] go to a Bible School attend any seminary
[1:33:03] training but I felt superior to these
[1:33:06] people because they didn't know the
[1:33:07] mysteries and you can't win people that
[1:33:13] way
[1:33:14] you can't win people we can't we'll win
[1:33:18] people when they could sense that your
[1:33:22] attitude is I can't learn anything from
[1:33:24] you you have everything to learn for me
[1:33:27] I know it all
[1:33:31] that was our attitude in the beginning
[1:33:34] but God was gracious and he asked me as
[1:33:42] time went on we learned how to be to
[1:33:46] become one with the Ministry like this
[1:33:49] brother Molino here he was driving a
[1:33:54] motorbike the organization gave him a
[1:33:56] motorbike but he was living on $30 a
[1:34:02] month stipend from the organization can
[1:34:06] you imagine that $30 a month and he had
[1:34:09] to push gas on the motorcycle and his
[1:34:14] wife was taking care of 40 children in
[1:34:16] an orphanage put up by the same
[1:34:20] organization and he was given another
[1:34:23] $30 a month so the two of them together
[1:34:26] $60 a month and they're working for the
[1:34:31] nomination and the spread of Molina was
[1:34:32] saying you know I'm doing this with all
[1:34:35] my heart you know I'm doing it for the
[1:34:38] Lord but no matter how I how I try to
[1:34:42] deny it I feel that I'm doing this for
[1:34:45] people I'm doing this for the
[1:34:48] organization not for the Lord I'm being
[1:34:50] exploited hallelujah and you know right
[1:34:56] away when when we say denominational
[1:34:59] ministers we think they're well
[1:35:01] supported but they are not well
[1:35:03] supported not all of them are works well
[1:35:06] supported like this brother and so when
[1:35:09] we will realize that we started building
[1:35:13] our relationship with them we started to
[1:35:16] become one with them in our purpose of
[1:35:20] getting the Word of God to the people
[1:35:23] help them with Bibles help them with
[1:35:26] finances
[1:35:27] then they started opening up to us
[1:35:31] that's when the churches started
[1:35:34] converting to the message and mass as a
[1:35:38] whole congregation so now I can think of
[1:35:43] more than a hundred churches now from
[1:35:47] denomination that have converted to the
[1:35:50] message because we change our attitude
[1:35:55] hallelujah
[1:35:56] we got down to their level and became
[1:36:00] one of them and we sympathized with them
[1:36:03] we felt what they were feeling we
[1:36:06] understood the challenge that they were
[1:36:08] facing hallelujah and that's when we
[1:36:12] gained they gained we gained they gained
[1:36:16] our respect or that way around
[1:36:22] hallelujah
[1:36:23] don't be like they octopus in third John
[1:36:28] chapter 1 verse 9 to 10 I don't think I
[1:36:32] have it
[1:36:34] yeah we're lead us read that first
[1:36:39] paradigm said God you sweated it out for
[1:36:41] us the Holy Spirit come down convinced
[1:36:46] people that they were wrong they were
[1:36:49] sinning their spirits were arrogant they
[1:36:54] become hostile Snoopy know-it-all not
[1:36:59] willing to repent not willing to forgive
[1:37:02] people that's done things against them
[1:37:04] there wasn't willing to
[1:37:06] but today the Holy Spirit took the Word
[1:37:09] of God
[1:37:10] and place it right in their gentle
[1:37:12] hearts and said now do you want to come
[1:37:15] back to where you was the first time you
[1:37:18] come to the altar come back to where
[1:37:20] everybody you love everybody and you
[1:37:23] love me with your undying love
[1:37:25] then just rise up he said and come to
[1:37:28] the altar and they did it Lord oh I want
[1:37:34] to be an app prappas I don't want to be
[1:37:38] a deal trapeze
[1:37:40] the octopus John said of the octopus I
[1:37:44] wrote in to you the church but the earth
[1:37:48] Epis who loved it to have the
[1:37:51] preeminence among them receive it as nah
[1:37:54] there's somebody that wants to lord it
[1:37:58] over the other believers
[1:38:00] he was the church boss at that time
[1:38:03] self-appointed church boss hallelujah
[1:38:07] who loveth to have preeminence among
[1:38:09] them receiveth us not and ver for if I
[1:38:12] come I will remember his deeds with he
[1:38:15] do it
[1:38:16] John was exposing him because he was
[1:38:19] practically malicious words and not
[1:38:22] content therewith neither that he
[1:38:25] himself received the Brethren and
[1:38:27] forbiddeth them that would and casted
[1:38:30] them out of the church hallelujah

[1:42:19] realizing that we have come short Lord
[1:42:23] we only think of our own spiritual
[1:42:27] maturity sometimes we become indifferent

[1:42:38] as we are spiritually but we think of
[1:42:43] them right now

[1:42:48] times people that have backslidden

[1:43:16] of poor people hallelujah that they're
[1:43:22] having a hard time to make ends meet we

[1:43:31] but just can for many reasons but father
[1:43:38] we pray for them just like a pop press
[1:43:40] prayed for the perfection of others
