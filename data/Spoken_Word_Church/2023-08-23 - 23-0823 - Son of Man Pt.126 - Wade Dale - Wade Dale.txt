household Lord thank goodness we made it to a half of a week and we've come assembled together I hope we come to hear from the Lord not from each other and while you're getting uh getting all situated brother Louise has a announcement to make and let him come on up and do it now and then we'll continue with the service yeah everybody just be in prayer we have a brother coming this weekend from Peru he's going to be speaking for us and so will brother Louise of your time here over by the way it's time um uh you can be seated for just a moment um some of you all know that that this come in December we're going to be at a uh we're holding a youth camp in in Honduras um it's a youth camp that we've held before brother Eric who we support here he's he's going to be hosting it so this is going to be his second year doing it um so um brother Eric they're they're they're got everything going right now they're preparing and so he was telling me about that I asked him where they mostly need the help in and so they're expecting about 250 to 300 campers coming in kids not just from Honduras but also from Nicaragua so um they need uh he said that that they they could they could use you know probably around up to about three thousand dollars to just help with the food and um and if you if you do the math on that for about 250 to 300 kids that's about that's about 12 a kid and that'll feed them for three days three days yeah so if you can if there's anything that anybody would like to do brother Aaron is going to be there with me and so uh it's going to be one of the speakers there and uh so we're going to be going there and also brother Christian from from Ohio he's going as well we've already collected we're already secured about 350 dollars if I'm not mistaken so if you feel in your heart and if you got money laying around that you could put some kids to hear the gospel for three days then do so that the Lord will bless you greatly um and because brother brother Eric he's not trying to uh you know if he can't he's not trying to raise all of it up he just he told me he said if you can't if whatever you can brother Louise if you if you can collect that'd be fine if not we'll do what we can here so technically all the kids you know they they pay a little fee to to to go in but if they can't they just can't they just let them they let they let them camp for free because the main thing is to hear the gospel and probably the majority of them probably will not pay so so and that's what happened last year so where we helped last year when we were there it was in this area it was with the food and that was with some of the funds that you all had given us when we were previously there for like you know a couple of weeks that's when they last had that camp so um but I just want to put that in your on your laps and on your hearts so whatever you want to help me just I guess come to me or to my wife and uh we'll be more than glad to uh assist you there so God bless you all thank you hey you got between now and Christmas if you don't know what to give somebody for Christmas give it to them November 24th is when they're leaving you're leaving November 24th so we've got from now to November the 24th so let's stand our feet just remember brother Ryan announced I'm going to have a prostate biopsy on Friday they have found some abnormalities but we're going to pray that them abnormalities will become abnormal again they won't know where to find them um also brother Luis Angel human is that right no I know well forget that I'm from Georgia not South America I'm from South Georgia I'm South I'm from South North America but anyway he's coming Sunday and he's going to preach for us he's from Peru he's a minister there he's a pastor actually isn't he yeah Pastor there in Peru and we met him at the camp meeting and um and it's just going to be two regular services and just like usual this coming weekend so just keep that in your prayer also two biggies that are coming up September the 16th will be brother Andrew Glover will be here that weekend um contact Brother Luke Gibson also brother Luke Gibson is going to have his camp meeting sometime in there I think it's the next weekend but we'd like to go brother Homer Longoria and a few of them are going to be speaking in that and we would like to go and support them because he's going to bring a group he says on the 16th of brother Andrew Glover some of his Youth and he's got a bunch of Youth so we want to be prepared for that also we're bringing back the Fall Festival this year but we're going to do a little bit different it's going to be on Sunday October the 29th brother Vernon malahan will be with us that Sunday so we'll just have one service and then we'll leave here and we'll go down to the park at Gillsville and have a fall festival with food games prizes and all that what we used to do we will do that on Sunday afternoon Lord willing okay and uh we'll when that time comes or gets close to it we'll get together with sister Rachel in different ones and we will uh figure out what we're doing also I heard from Brother George Quinn called today he's coming been praying that that man would come and visit you all know that he's real dear to all of our heart well he called today and uh and told us that he would be here on October the 15th so that's the only weekend we had left in October because brother Trevor emins is coming Brother David gadman's coming and brother whoever I just said is coming and brother George is going to slide in on the 15th of October so we're gonna have little brother George with us you know he lost his wife a couple of years no less than a year about a year ago and um and he's kind of been staying around home and we sure missed him and he hasn't been here in a couple years because of taking care of sister Jackie and and covet and all so we want to see brother George and he's gonna he's gonna come and be with us so we'll have something maybe special that weekend May do a Saturday night Sunday service and then have a meal afterwards because I brother George likes to fellowship and a lot of times he gets to run in and run out well we're going to try to keep him that weekend and and we just pray for all these ones that these things that are coming up we're trying to keep trying to keep everybody busy since we all have nothing else to do yeah amen yeah you're the very one that says hey man you got three jobs all right let's keep all this in prayer and uh that the Lord will be with us and be your brother um uh human this weekend as we have a regular service um let's turn to is that on I think we're having internet issues too so just bear with us this would be part 106 son of man we're going to talk a little bit today and try to get to where we talk about the anointing and keep on going a little bit further something that the Lord was dealing with me the other night and um and kept going back to so we'll just keep going back to it so let's bow our heads just for a minute Lord thank you for this day thank you for everything you give us thank you for this building Lord it will have to come to Lord that we have that we can come to lord it's it's warm in the winter and it's cool in the summer father and now I pray Lord that you would just send a coolness of your holy spirit with us today Lord because without you we have no service Lord without you there's nothing for us to do here but with you here Lord Lord send the power as you said we'd be endued with power from on high Lord just fill us all with the Holy Spirit tonight give us a supercharge during the middle of the week Lord I pray this should be the ones of the sixth sister Freedom different ones Lord just take care of those situations father and sister Joyce and and Lord many ones that that are sick that's that's not with us and haven't been with us for for a little while we pray that you would strengthen them Lord You're Still the Healer you're still the great physician and Lord you're the ones that will you're the one that will take care of all these needs father we ask in Jesus name amen now something we're going to talk about tonight is is um how the Holy Spirit you know it took a prophet to tell us that the Holy Spirit was timid and he and many times about 28 to 30 times he he addressed the holy spirit being timid in a service or in a situation or in prayer or in other things in life the holy spirit is really timid so we're going to talk about that maybe just a little bit because because the Bible says grieve not the Holy Spirit we'll read in just a minute well if you don't want these virtues if you don't want to be part of the Statue of perfect man if you don't want to be a perfect image of God you can grieve the Holy Spirit and just lock him down to where he cannot move and that was what happened in the church ages because brother Brown talks about that we were during the church ages they became cold formal and Powerless why they had some of the word of God they had the holy spirit for their age but they became powerless because they bound the Holy Spirit under what false Doctrine now what we're trying to do is get that false Doctrine out of us us get that false Doctrine away from us to where the Lord can move freely in our hearts and lives amen so let's read in the beginning was the word where with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us we beheld his glory the glory the only begotten of the father for the grace and truth John 3 3 says Jesus answered and said verily verily in other words listen listen I say unto thee except the man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God then of course Nicodemus being the great teacher he goes back to the carnality of his mind and he says do I have to go back in my mother's womb Jesus said no except a man be born of water and a spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God that which is born of the flesh is flesh born of the spirit of spirit Marvel not that I said unto you you must be born again you'll be seated he didn't say you need to be or you might ought to be he said you must be born again he is compelled each and every one of us to be filled with the Holy Ghost all right and that's why we're looking at the bottom of that pyramid it's wide because the Lord can can begin to move in your life if you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he fills you with the spirit of God he can he it's like a newborn babe it's like something you know while I'm out of the womb and I've got this whole new world that I'm looking at and then all of a sudden though the cares of Life takes over you get hungry you have dirty diapers you have this you have that you become a teenager mom and daddy says you can't do this and you can't do that right then what do you do you Rebel and that's what we do even as Christians yes as Christians we Rebel all right because the Bible says grieve not well grieving is what grieving is rebelling how are you the most grieved to your children when they disobey you it Grieves you the most we call it mad sometimes but mostly it's grief because remember that old thing that it'll hurt me more than it hurts you yeah okay kids you'll understand that one day if the Lord tears and you have children it will hurt you because it tears your heart out to have to what to have to correct you one you've been told over and over and over again just like um um this past weekend and different times I've been noticing and and that's kind of why I think the Lord kind of brought me back to that um grieve not the holy spirit of God because remember brother Brown says one one child running through this building could cause the next service what happens the holy spirit is bound and it leaves the building right now I'm telling you what a prophet says so he could see those things it wasn't we're not presuming we're not trying to read in a book that James Dobson thought mine and Lord help James Dobson he's good for his time but he wasn't a prophet he couldn't see into another dimension to see that Holy Spirit I'll read it here in just a little while where he says the whole you know in other words the holy spirit's all over the building let's let's not let's not let's not get emotional let's not get all this that's what that's why I don't I don't get about people because brother Branham calmed people down for prayer lines boy that hurts your feelings doesn't it but he calmed people down he said calm down don't move he was in total control why because he said every one of you is a spirit he said I can see these Spirits moving and you know what it was doing it was confusing him because they were doing this you know if you were moving back and forth and and also I want you to please I we need prayer for for for children's bladder in this in this church and I'm not joking your kid can sit for three hours and play on a computer and never go to the bathroom but you let the preacher get about 15 minutes into a service mama I gotta go tell them to sit there for a little while my mama didn't I never peed in my pants one time let me just be real real playing William she's sitting at home watching she knows that for a fact she said you sit there boy then maybe when you get tears in your eyes and you just really start bubbling you know you say Mom I gotta go but we don't need that to happen during a service to where now we're we're a little bit bigger than we used to be we've got more kids we've got more young people just be careful remember I told you I don't you know one time it's okay but now when one kid goes three or four times we need prayer for the sick that's why we got deacons we got deacons gonna be telling you hey stop go back and sit down go back and sit down in the seat you can go in a little while I don't care if they do that they should do that especially when they walk by them four four or five times same person now if you're sick there's a different story and I'd say here you go everybody's like well what about okay well what about but what about you just letting your kid go to the bathroom anytime they go I gotta go no they don't have to go let me ask you a question didn't you when you were growing up in a church you always wanted to go to the bathroom and you really didn't have to go let me see the old people say amen that's what I thought so guess what your kids ain't no different I don't care they're Halos held up by horns just like the rest of them all right First Peter 1 verse 22 but now I'm telling you uh we wonder sometimes why that we fail as a church brother Brown says that it's because the holy spirit's timid and you'll just drive him out on a limb and he'll sit there until you call him back well we're going to call him back we're going to make sure that we even our kids we don't just don't let them go to the bathroom all the time and and let them go beforehand and I know we have only three bathrooms and I'm sorry I apologize that we don't have enough room but if you'll pray hard enough we'll work on that we'll either pray all y'all out of here anyway we'll pray you some room okay and I'm serious I know that I know it's hard being crunched in a in a small building with a group of people but still you can be more observant all right um I mean they're your kids you watch after them you made them you handle them amen that's our job that's our job as parents it's not just something that we might do or need to do you must be born again you must be parents to your children or we will grieve the Holy Spirit and you think why sometimes you see the Holy Spirit moving and all of a sudden it just goes well you never know you know you never know what's going on back there or something uh let's just try to let let's get this let's get this thing moving and and in the right direction and number one I don't want the Holy Spirit to ever feel uncomfortable in this building I want the devil to feel uncomfortable in this building all right seeing that you purified your souls and obeying the truth through the spirit under unfeigned love of the Brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently you see I the way I the way I see it is the way I've been for a couple years being up here you know and and helping to guide for a little while you you see that you you look at that one scripture and you say all right you you have love for the Brethren whether they love you or not you have love for those that are unlovable you have love for those that's not even in the building because I what you know what that does that's what brings them into building that's what brings them back to God is not you being you being a hound dog yourself doing things you're not supposed to do outside in front of them but we have unfeigned love it's a love that there's no condition it's a love that that that I don't it doesn't bother me if brother Donnie doesn't shake my hand but now he makes a point to do it and I appreciate that but if he doesn't then I just want to see his soul save all right I want to see your soul and I want you to see your kids Soul slave I'm really not worried about your feelings y'all ought to know that by now I just don't I don't work on feelings all right I'm sorry I do have a heart but I don't have a whole lot of feelings all right because feelings were What feelings will guide you in the wrong direction it'll make you make the wrong decision right all right okay so the Bible tells us Peter tells us being born again all right so listen this is a work this is a work it's not just I'm born again now I'm going to sit down on a rock no that's when brother Brown said that's when the battle really begins all right so being born again not of corruptable seed in other words breaking away from your Humanity your feelings but of Incorruptible what by the word of God which liveth and a body forever brother forever brother down stood up here years and years and years and he's told us just like Paul Paul's preaching his heart out and he's seeing people walk away and he's seeing people you know do you know go away and you see brother around him he comes and he preaches and he preaches to the Pentecostals it's supposed to be up the ones up here at the time all right there wasn't a lot of message Believers while he was preaching okay he was about the only one that believed the message okay at that time but he was trying to see a group mature and they weren't maturing the Pentecostals he said you get worse every year he said I come to California he said you cut your hair more he said I preach on it you cut your hair more what they didn't get a revelation all right so we want a revelation from God that'll what make us go forward that will make us go forward that if that if if a preacher does come in here and he sees people you know falling apart and wearing makeup and cutting their hair and all that stuff and then all of a sudden the next service he comes and they quit doing that and the next service like Cindy used to do I mean she's a prime example lovered her dad she came in here with all painted up and fingernails looked like the devil and all other kind of stuff and but you know what Brookdale just kept preaching he never looked at her and said hey you shouldn't do that he wouldn't weave it in the message you know that but he never did beat her over the head and you know what about two or three months later she quit wearing pants just quit cutting her hair and I believe she received the Holy Ghost right here in her simple way that evening that evening Services she came up here I just really do you say well where's she now well she's in a nursing home or wherever she is so her body's gone but her mind's still sharp and and she's wearing not wearing pants and not wearing makeup you know so what happened that's what I'm looking for I'm not looking for y'all to come to church every Sunday and you still cut your hair and you still paint your fingernails and all that I'm okay anyway you must be born again God bless his word and I want to take the subject this morning of Jesus's first Doctrine so his first Doctrine was what you must be born again now we find out that there's so many different meanings so we've been trying to and we know that that even in the message ranks there's many meanings to the word being born again all right being born again as we were talking not too long ago me and somebody was talking and and people say well brother Graham changed it after the seals because he got this great Revelation well you know what the great Revelation he got was that you must be born again the same as you was back then that he preached back there because on future home he said he said praise God he said I've been preaching these three stages all the way through my Ministry and have never changed well that was way after the seals was praised it is not just believing this message it is not just believing brother Brown was a prophet or cut not cutting your hair or not painting your face or not doing those things do's and don'ts it's being born again like brother Luke said Christ is who we're getting born again under not brother Branham Christ is who the one who's going to lead us and guide us into all truth and if you have that Christ inside of you it will lead you to the message it'll have to it can't deny the word for the day remember you know what brother Brown said the reason you know you have the Holy Ghost is what the word what inside of you agrees with the word for your day now see we agree with Luther Plus we agree with Luther to a point now we don't go to the pub and drink a beer and smoke a pot but Luther was allowed to do that under justification he was trying to get the people out of the Catholic church and get them Born Again under Luther's message but that won't get you born again because why God moved he moved up to Wesley and then from Wesley to Pentecost and then from Pentecost he brought it out as one of the brothers that was talking the other day we're grain this is not plant stock not even Chuck because the Shucks pulled away or pulling away right now and we've come back to the full grain so there's not another plant to come it's full seed to come all right and we find out there's so many different meanings that people put nearly all churches and we know that for a fact ask a Methodist how do you know you're born again just ask them ask a Pentecostal how do you know you're born again they'll tell you because I spoke in tongues amen I mean you'll guess what you'll get I've heard it myself through in my own ears but brother Brian said there must be and there's a truth somewhere and now remember it didn't say you ought to be born again it says You must be born again so God had to send us a prophet and that Prophet was a mouthpiece I was thinking today I was reading an article that brother um Tim Pruitt wrote about brother Branham and how the the the Belize assigned people have all these fallacies of brother Branham and his life and all these different things and some of them are true he's a human he's a human being but the word it brought me clarity it brought Christ to me not in a portion but in a hole it brought the whole person all right and that's what's required they weren't required the whole person they were required parts of the body that is our requirement now the full headship with the body underneath that when the head says move the arm moves it's not when the arm says move the head moves no when the head says move the arm moves all right brother Brown says look you're still what you are until you're actually born again of the spirit of God it doesn't change you in other words it doesn't change you to be shaking a hand or to fill out a form or press play or not press play whatever it is it's not going to change you what's going to change you is the Inside Man so that's what we're looking at is for the Holy Ghost to burn out that old part of you now listen you're still going to we know that you're still going to have problems with the this guy because he he's three a Triune being he's three parts and thank God that we're three parts because a lot of times and let me just go ahead and forward this through and and maybe not be so long tonight when it says grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you're a seal to the day of your Redemption a lot of you and me and a lot of Christian believers take that as I'm not born again when they feel that I've got one Aaron's like me but it happens to all of us you see people struggle and they think they're not born again so they need to be baptized again and they need to be this and they need to come to the Altar and they need to no find out what grieved him work on that one thing [Music] okay life is gonna happen you're gonna have bills your kids are going to do idiotic things because you did it too praise the Lord right well now everybody's going yep exactly right but those are things in life though put that aside quit struggling when you've already got the thing down inside that you need but what's the devil's job the devil's job say I don't think you got that you wouldn't do that now you you wouldn't burn Tony's chicken chicken no they ain't got nothing to do with that's life that's just her not cooking good which is the fallacy an example only and you know what everybody knew that because you all the all the women jump said what but now those things we've got to be able to separate them and I think even in the Statue of perfect man that's what we're doing is helping me I've helped you guys praise the Lord but it's helping me to separate that time that that I think well man I ain't even born again okay if I have if I've got this you know situation that I got and I just totally fail everybody with me I just totally fall on my face you know what get back up you all you've done is you just grieve that timid man that's inside of you you have grieved him in he's kind of steps aside and brother Brown said he'll stay there until you what call him back so how are you going to call him back you're going to call him back with vice versa of what you did to put him out there on a limb because remember look he's not gonna just I know you're gonna fail I'm just gonna stay out here no you send him out there with something you did we send him out there with something we did because he's not just gonna go well I know I'm you no I can't stand you no he loves you he loves to occupy your body thank you he loves you with the love this unconditional but we make it conditional and grieve him and then what did you do he just steps over to the side and he says okay I'm going to let you fight that battle I know I'm gonna have to come on the scene and help you and I know when but you don't so here's your child training here's your here's here's where I'm going to show up as a parent and I'm going to help you so our nature to begin with is sinful so listen so the holy spirit that Tim and holy spirit is not going to dwell in your soul if you have sin in your soul sin in your soul means you're not born again pretty plain you have sin in your spirit but remember a Christian can't sin because the seed remaineth in him your soul is perfect it's God in another form but we've got to realize how to separate that and put that over to the side maybe as we say in our own in our own language put it over to the side and let's start working on this thing where the ball we're bouncing we're creating a lot of noise so he just steps over here okay fight the battle I'm gonna help you but I'm not going to jump in real quick I'm gonna let you fight the thing and that's what we do but that doesn't mean you're not born again that doesn't mean you have to run to the altar that doesn't mean see what brother Brown says and and we get it I know we need the altar but brother Brown said every time you come up here you get weaker now I'm telling you exactly what he said you get weak or when you why because your faith is put in right here not right there I want the faith to be put in there not up here this may fail you but you get it inside your heart setting where you're at tonight or whenever you come to church you won't need to come up here when we realize that we are children of God we are Kings and Priests we're not waiting waiting to be listen brother Brown said one time he said how can you rule you know how can we rule and Reign if we can't Rule and Reign this first and this might be just a Wednesday night Wednesday night but roll this guy first this is listen this is where the Holy Ghost dwells that's where your Holy Ghost yours don't dwell in me it's the same person but you're a person and brother Brown said it's God and you in there as persons because God deals me different with me different than he does you but it's the same Holy Ghost and it's in the same place it's in your soul so if you you know if you stumble and fall or if you you know you think well man I shouldn't have done that I know I must not be born again if the devil told you that's a lie we know that all right so don't write just put your anchor in faith that big old wide foundation and just say hey be like that guy says Lord if I don't have it you'll find a bag of bones right here till I get it that's how direct we have to be because you see it we're talking about the Old Testament they didn't receive a promise you and I received a promise in the beginning and the in the hinge point between the Old Testament and the New Testament we received the promise a promise of the Holy Ghost all right I promise this promising is to you and your children the promise of the Holy Ghost not just anointing you and not just making you act like a Christian but it makes you a Christian God having provided some better thing for us okay so we got a better thing that they without us should not be made complete because we as humans we always when we come to that word perfect we say no way right you ain't perfect that ain't perfect well the Bible never says that the Bible never quotes it says be therefore perfect it talks about having perfect faith it talks about having the promise it's to you and your children and them that far off as means the Lord that God shall call you will see you shall receive the gift are the promise of the Holy Ghost in your soul I think sometimes we get away from that but it's a promise that you can hold God to that promise and kids everybody anybody that's been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you just stand right there and say Lord this is it I'm not going back to that water again because you didn't promise me three or four times you said one time repent and be baptized and receive the Holy Ghost put yourself in the position that listen then God has to do what he said I want to put God in position where he has to do what he says what about a prophet stood up one day and said if God don't do this and that like he did it before he said you can call him a liar well now who's going to call God a liar but he made it pretty plain that if God didn't do what he said with the same set of situations now you got to be the same set of situation repent be baptized and receive the promise all right don't repent don't don't skip the repent part feel you need to just be baptized and then you quit going to church or you don't read your Bible you don't do you just got wet okay but I promise you if you'll repent number one you feel a whole lot better if you'll really repent then what we'll do God will watch in Ezekiel that's what we're coming to a new heart I will give you and a new spirit will I put within you you've got to realize and I want to hammer this home for the next several Services you've got to know where you're at in your journey you've got to know it's not you must I mean you you might need to know you must know to go up these virtues to get the to get the spiritual part of these virtues you've got to know where you're at man you got to know where you're at and brother Brown said you can know where you can know where you're at with God at any time some of us just don't want to know but I want to know Amen in some way somehow God will vindicate in your life where you're at if you'll just hang on a minute because you know the devil's here in this same sermon so he's going to fill you with the same junk that he's filled you with before well you can't do this you ain't done Latin isn't it he's a liar but a new heart can you not feel that when you first started your journey I know every one of us some of you how many of you were born and was just like raised in the message centers anyway worse because you thought that's what saved you and I know you don't now I know you don't now but you might have it one time thought that well salvation comes through believing what Mom and Daddy believe and I'm coming to church with them and that's about the best I can do no you have to have a new heart nothing new and a new spirit will I put within you in other words something comfortable I used to come twice a year I did you did a lot of y'all did too come twice a year it was at Christmas and Easter crowd you know oh and if they had a special time when when Esther was cooking her her wonderful squash casserole fill the pews but anyway you feed them they'll come in like brother Dale said you get them in with a hot dog you can get them out with a hamburger all right but if you'll get a new spirit then that's where that it's not it's where you want to come it's where you want that you you want and then all this other stuff is great just gravy to me but a new spirit but but when I used to come to church I'd sit there and and honest to God folks I didn't want to come you didn't either I didn't want to come because I didn't come back that's what proof that I didn't want to come but I did it for my mom and my family which and that's okay at least I came to church twice okay better than some but what did it do it just absolutely made me feel horrible because there was a spirit inside of me that didn't like being here I was comfortable out there all right I was comfortable out there oh it was like you know that was my security blanket I could go out there and do what I wanted to but when I came in here I had to and pay attention try to stay awake right let's just be honest with each other but when God got a hold of me and gave me a new heart and gave me a new spirit he gave me a zeal that when I walked in that door I was so comfortable when I come to this church in any church I'm not uncomfortable if you're uncomfortable we do need to pray for you amen and if you'll get it if you'll get it out there and get done there with it instead of bringing it in here you won't have to go out there with it again um I'll take away your Stony heart and I'll give you a heart of Flesh we all were rebellious we all didn't care we didn't care about this church thing you know singing songs and coming to church and listening to a preacher and back then Brothers you got two hours two and a half three all right we endured but now that same thing that same situation because I'm born again now that changes that whole scenario puts me in the same place but with a different spirit with a different attitude that I knew I knew going to not just fill me with the Holy Ghost he's going to keep filling me he's going to keep teaching me he's still going to lead me and guide me into all truth he's not going to send me out to where I come in here and I say well the message is wrong there's nothing good about this I'm gone no there was something inside they said that ain't nothing but the truth because in one day he said I'll put my spirit now when he puts his spirit inside of you how can it be rebellious to the word of God how can God fight God just the same as when Jesus said how can Satan fight Satan how can God fight God it's not the conflict between God and God it's a conflict between the devil and God all right and remember what brother Chris preached you're the you're the Battleground but when he puts yours his Spirit within you he causes you to walk in all these things that we thought were law our do's and don'ts I have to do this I have no you want to because the guy that wrote this book is inside of you now oh Ezekiel no the spirit that was in ezekiel's inside of you though Joshua no the spirit that's in Joshua's inside of you there's your difference then we know we go through justification sanctification baptism in the Holy Ghost we're not we're going to skip every bit of that because we already been through it we know what we we should know now that what the Holy Ghost was sent for was to what teach us things all right you say no I've got to shout or speak in tongues see there we go back to the same old thing of of passing out well this is what the Holy Ghost says and that's it brother Brian said it was believing the word for your day right all right well now believe in the word for your day don't keep you out of church somebody else does the word of your day does not teach you to wear pants or us to curse or us to smoke or we always talk about the women hair and dress we're about as dirty as they you know or dirty but we take now and we see that all these years I was thinking today I watched a little snippet where brother Dale was preaching well actually um well I'm gonna give them a I'm gonna give him a crown the people in Ohio you know they've kind of they've got their own Pastor now um um I want to call him Richard for some some silly reason but that's his daddy but his name is Richard but Isaac is his name that we call him brother Isis to Pastor the church down they're doing quite well but they still every week they pick a series that either brother Dale preached back in the 2000s or one that I preach in the 2015-1617 they just finished the seal but they're watching Daddy and and brother Elisha was sent he sent me a WhatsApp or I mean a Marco Polo and he pointed up to the screen in his house and he was watching brother Dale was preaching on a series about something see that's what teaching's about and I'm not putting brother anything if you're if your Holy Spirit does not say I need to listen to more than just Sunday and Wednesday if you want to feed off of something else you need a different feeder but they sit down and they as a collective group before they before brother Isaac took over as a collective group they sat down and they would watch the whole series on Wednesday night they would get together watch the whole series of whoever was preaching then they would pick up our Wednesday service on archive and they'd listen to it right before they went to bed now how many of y'all do that I'm sorry how many of us do that but it brought in remembrance when he pointed his finger up to him and yeah he's my dad okay I don't want I went I didn't pick him okay but you've pretty doggone good preacher whether he's my daddy or not all right okay Daddy or not I was just blessed to have a spiritual father a natural father and all that and I still messed up yeah I still left for 20 years but anyway when he pointed up there to brother Dale you could see I see him now and I saw him see him then he was just so sharp but that was the Holy Spirit teaching us over all those years and what's your point by the way somewhere that's got to come to fruition if it was the Holy Spirit it's got to come to fruition somebody's got to grab a hold of that and like we talked about and listen don't put it on a man [Music] William he was a mouthpiece to bring it it was somebody God chose that yielded himself brother Dale different ones yielding themselves so that they could bring you a message now what do you do with it is your business that's why I see the message the way we were taught in this church is it's a it's the word of God in human flesh speaking to your human flesh and that Holy Spirit if it's in there it'll speak right through that flesh right into your soul if it's not it's just sounding brass and a tinkling symbol it's just words on a page brother Brown same ways just words on a page if we don't have the Holy Spirit to teach us see that's Bible actually that's Jesus talking to us so he's telling us what's going to happen when this Holy Ghost is going to come not upon you but in you he's going to bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you Luke 24 49 behold I send the promise of my father upon you but carry you in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high now we know that in due means to put on clothe with I like that one where it says in the sense of sinking into a garment not this garment your flesh garment all right so it's going to sink in it's going to be in dude it's not just going to those licks of fire just didn't follow him around no it disappeared inside of them went into those people and whatever that pillar fire was they became that remember they weren't called Christians until Christ got in them you're not a Christian until God gets inside of you so he said you being dude with dunamis or what power now look the difference in the two dunamis is an inherent power now what happened though when Jesus was here in Matthew he actually gave them power now watch that's excusa which is a different kind of power because what he'd done it gave them Authority it didn't give them permanent Authority when you have when you have dunamis power you have permanent authority over the devil you have permanent authority over you exclusive power can come on you and come off you because he said look here cast out devils do this preach the gospel Judas was there but did he receive the Holy Ghost no he got excusia he never got dunamis because dunamis is an inherent power in other words what you inherits what's inside of you something came down inside of you and then they what they were called Christians in Antioch because they acted like Christ but Judas didn't but he got excuse your power or exosia power it's a power of choice though physical and mental power something that can come on you but it can come off of you just like an anointing just like these excuse me these virtues yes they're a part of the Holy Ghost but but they are not something that let me just go ahead and tell you they're not required for you to be a Christian is to have all these virtues all right everybody with me because you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost in your soul and stay a baby whatever you decide you grieve him so much or listen grieving would be more like like brother Bob it'd be like going to a church that just says well all you got to do is just believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved you don't know no better about growth you don't know anything about growing up you don't know about about further my uh you know not not say the message of the hour but even in the Bible the Bible if you stood here and read every scripture about growing you couldn't get it in a sermon the whole Bible is all about growth it's all about maturing and God being able to use us but what happened and we're probably not going to get to it now but what happened in the Ages was it became formal powerless they said this is the Holy Ghost it's a trinitarian Doctrine this is the Holy Ghost baptized in the name of father son Holy Ghost they started splitting it apart and they didn't lose its Eternal quality it lost his power you shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days since that's your promise but now Paul says look but you shall receive power after Jesus said after the Holy Ghost has come upon you so in other words you become as Jesus said brother Brown said right here in the Book of Revelations right of Revelation Jesus Christ watch now remember this Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts now see I see the book of Acts and brother Ryan's life now I see the book of Acts in our life we got the doctrines correct the basic doctrines we got all that correct listen they didn't have the seals Paul never said one word about it sure he preached about it but he never said this is Seal number one seal number two the book's been open to me no he didn't say that okay but remember he wrote the message or the or the Bible eighty percent of the old of the New Testament that we're supposed to keep and we don't keep all of it I'm talking about denominations got a uh just and listen and I'm not being comical but we need to pray for the Methodist people they're good folks and in our community there's one sitting right there on the hill in town that they're going to have their vote this coming weekend Sunday they're going to vote whether to stay in that United Methodist Church and have gays and lesbians and all preaching their Pulpit are they going to vote to turn it out but when they vote just turn it out the Methodist Church owns the building the people don't own it you people own this building they don't own that building if they don't vote the way the United Methodist Church wants them to vote they'll be without a church and they'll just let them sit empty that's how a denomination is they let us Church set empty and people die without a church then to admit they're wrong so just pray for them I mean they're they're good people they're not trying to be evil they're trying to be good they're trying to do what they can do to get you know get it and get into the kingdom of God uh who's a judge I'm not to judge them but the Book of Revelations shows how that the Anaconda now remember the church and the Christ in the true church is a continuation the book of Acts but the Book of Revelation shows look how that the Antichrist Spirit would come into the church and defile it make it lukewarm formal and Powerless they didn't do away with it listen the church ages weren't destroyed when Luther stood out and and went in a in a pub and drank beer and smoked the pipe and talks about God okay no God wainted his ignorance and said that's what I need you to do you're the man for the hour for that right there and he was the only man for that hour or he depicts somebody else he's not nobody in this world could do what brother stand what brother Brown stood no way no way he almost went crazy himself several times right the Bible said in the last days there'd be churches another Tower of Babel that have a form of godliness but deny the God's word in power the power of His word because they don't deny the word every Methodist this coming Sunday they'll even open up the Bible and they'll preach out of the Bible right but they preach it with a denomination behind them that's pushing them and telling them what to preach that's what they're trying to come out from from the United Methodist Church and what is the word what is the kingdom of God we got to belong to the kingdom before we can ever be subjects of that King well how do you get into the kingdom the kingdom of God is the word of God made back in power you and I today we have seen it with our own eyes the word back in power believe it or not you say well we're all about half asleep tonight you're about to divorce to death the words in power somewhere all right you're not going to shut it down by shutting yourself down Acts 2 verse 4 says and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues of the spirit gave him utterance Acts 19 1 . Paul says if you received the Holy Ghost since you come in this message and they said unto him we don't know anything about this message we just know that Jesus is a Christ Paul said look let me tell you something let me expound on just a little bit no real now look he didn't deny he didn't say no John you ain't got to listen to what John said right he didn't say no don't listen to what John said he was false no he said John barely baptized with the baptism of repentance repent and that they should believe on him which should come after him that is on Christ Jesus and then if I can interpolate for Paul Paul says let me tell you about him cause I got him inside of me and when they heard this they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus and when Paul laid hands on him the Holy Ghost came on them and they spoke with tongues and prophesied here we are in Ephesians 4 verse 29 said let no now look how are you going to grieve the Holy Spirit corrupt communication that's what it says let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of edifying that it may Minister Grace not condemnation Grace unto the hearers and grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed until the day of redemption now see if you've if you look at that you say man I grieve the holy spirit that I'm gone no you're sealed whereby you're sealed you can grieve him out of the way a little bit or out on a limb as brother Brown calls it but now look he said now how can you grieve him he starts back again verse 31 let all bitterness that's a good way to grieve wrath good way to grieve anger that's pretty much all the statue of perfect man clamor evil speaking be put away from you with all malice be it kind one to another tenderhearted forgiving one another even as God for Christ's sake forgive you possession against the enemy brother Brown said look now be real reverent everybody now just be a real reverent keep quiet now he's in the middle of a prayer line this is an excerpt from the prayer line he's in the middle of a prayer line he's already prayed for a couple of people in the prayer line there's no commotion going on there's no screaming dead quiet be real reverent keep quiet see the holy spirit is so timid how many knows that just real timid Holy Spirit see just any little interruption bothers him any little Interruption you can fill in that blank all you want to okay coming to church late without praying up not reading not studying letting your kids go to the bathroom whenever they want to brother Ryan said we believe in justification by faith we believe that after the person is Justified he has peace with the Lord Jesus Christ but it's possible that this same person could have habits such as look watch this such as drinking smoking how many times have you heard people say I know I'm born again because I don't drink smoke and do things that I shouldn't do filthy habits of the flesh I've heard it with my own ears that's just justification really that's just heading into sanctification then we believe that the blood of Jesus Christ sanctifies this person for the service of the lord we believe in sanctification according to Hebrews 13 12 and 13 where Jesus also that he might sanctify the people with his own blood suffered without the gate and we believe that sanctification is taught in the New Testament and meant for the Believers through the New Testament age which we're now living so we he has not done away with sanctification we as a church has never done away with sanctification the bride will never do away with sanctification because you know what Paul said I Die daily I need a daily washing you need a daily washing all right we also believe that after the person has been Sanctified unclean habits is gone from that person not born again yet he's a believer on the Lord Jesus and his habits are gone we believe that then because God said I'm not dwell in an unclean vessel We Believe for the baptism of the Holy Ghost which comes as a film he never says that about justification and sanctification remember in justification of sanctification it's a getting out right unclean spirit's gone out you all your sins are chopped away in justification the unclean Spirit goes out but when the Holy Ghost comes it's a filling of the believer now listen if you're filled you're sealed you're just as Eternal as God is but you can absolutely still grieve that thing that you got inside of you and so harness it and and and and bind it till it has nowhere to work it was been bound in the churches that's what the problem is and maybe it's been bound in message churches too because they don't they haven't been taught well then he is cleansed by the blood of Jesus and the word sanctify means cleaned and set aside in the Old Testament the altar Sanctified The Vessel and it was set aside for service we believe that the Holy Spirit watch is putting that same vessel in service now let's talk about anointings for a minute everybody okay Matthew 7 verse 21 says not everyone that saith unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven watch many was many many will say to me in that day this is Jesus speaking Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy name not quit drinking alcohol Lord have we not prophesied in thy name in thy name cast out devils now listen Satan can't cast out Satan but God can so anoint a person to where that anointing will drive the Holy Ghost will drive the unclean Spirit out and by with me and that's good but you still don't have that intimate relationship that God wants because he's telling you right here and in thy name done many wonderful works then I will profess unto them now this is Jesus Christ I will profess unto them I never knew you that word knew is just like Adam knew his wife Eve it was an intimate relationship he is telling the person you never went on to the baptism of the Holy Ghost you thought you got into justification you thought you got it at sanctification but you didn't go on to get it because that's what a foolish virgin is right that's why the foolish virgin is but I don't want him to say depart from me I never knew you I want him to him to enter into the joy of oil my good and faithful servant trying to do God of service now notice in this David thought he had everything in order and it was inspired sometimes that's the way we are see how the Holy Spirit can anoint a man now watch the Holy Spirit can anoint a man the outside Spirit can be Anointed with the Holy Ghost and the soul is the darkest pitch so darkest pitch false teachers can rise teaching all kind of trinitarianisms and everything else or whatever you want to call it in the message and be Anointed with the Holy Ghost and perform just as many miracles as the true gospel can but by the word that's what does it do we see what he means he said see what I mean do we really see or do we seek Miracles and we seek that preacher that can preach louder and speak in tongues and run the aisles and or do we listen to what he says faith comes by shout and speak no faith comes by what hearing I'm not against all that when it's in order and it is it will be an order but but I'm like brother Dale said you bring you can bring 10 caskets up here and you can that man could raise all ten from the dead and they everyone get whole and walk out that door but if he preaches a false Doctrine I ain't listening to him that's hard to believe he said what no if you've been taught well and you got the holy ghost in your soul that won't trap you break them now look the anointed ones only the word will separate them not the signs oh no they'll do the same signs but the words what separates them they all prophesied they all done this done that and the other just the same Jesus said they'd do the same thing but the word is what separates them notice not the signs because signs what signs follow look at me follow here's the believer signs follow the believer not go in front I Don't Preach to see signs I preach and signs follow because who works a gift you do all right and then let's look just for a second we'll close right here the gifts of the Spirit are these virtues or battles as brother um Keith called them storms of maturity I want to look at this just for a minute and we'll close right here musicians get ready to come we'll stop on that little word metamorphosis that word metamorphosis means in an insect or an amphibian the process of transformation look from an immature form that butterfly is still inside there but it looks like a caterpillar I want you to watch some of these other things I want you to read this it's the process of transformation from an immature form to an adult exactly and now remember too that adult form may not always be the same as what you started to form in an adult form in two or more distinct stages let's say seven a change of the form or nature watch of a thing or person into a completely different one by natural or Supernatural means because remember that caterpillar when it when it comes out and it goes through the larva and it goes into the caterpillar that caterpillar eats and eats and eat and eat and eats leaves whatever the diet of it is it just Gorges itself with leaves but now remember when he becomes a butterfly a butterfly don't eat leaves but what the caterpillar ate is inside the butterfly well I thought I got a more should have got more amens than that but it's what you eat it's what the caterpillar eats and makes him a butterfly it's what you eat that makes you a mature Christian the Journey Begins With The Call to Adventure away from the Ordinary World one is familiar with and comfortable in okay I stole this from somebody watch but it's it's it's it's it's totally true initially one may deny this call because of its daunting pull toward the potential dangers unknown listen to be the Bride of Jesus Christ in the end time is something no person listen to me just for a minute no person has ever had the opportunity to be that no one so it is a daunting point and it's unchartered water that's why I took a profit and why it took a Seer to go up high and say hey this is not bad you gotta do it this way but this is not bad remember he talks about the guy climbing up and looking over the um he said that's what a prophet was right instead of looking through the peephole and seeing just a few things the prophet gets over and he gets up on somebody's shoulders or gets upon a box and he looks and he sees the whole arcade well that's what brother Brown did he saw the whole arcade but he didn't keep it he didn't jump over in the arcade and just start playing now he come back and told us the truth I don't care you can put whatever in between all that he told us the truth amen initially one may deny this call because of his daunting pull toward a potential dangers unknown you got to remember and I know you can't be a caterpillar but inside that caterpillar is everything of the butterfly no external nothing external it's but all of us changing there's a metamorphosis even in the cells the cells go to a different spot I hope y'all getting this it's what they eat makes the cells go to because listen caterpillars don't have wings not one caterpillar I know has wings but all the caterpillars that become butterflies have wings inside of them okay if answered look if praise the Lord if answered and acted upon this is not acting upon have you ever watched a caterpillar move kind of like some of us it might not get this far but it it has a purpose because when it gets this far in the day there's a leaf or bark right at the end of that and here's what he's going to eat all right struggle come to church do do the thing read the Bible pray if answered and acted upon one enters in a special word where one undergoes a series of tests and challenges the road of Trials or the statue of perfect man encounters enemies that caterpillar's got to watch because you know what they some things like to eat caterpillars them things are fat they're fat juicy big old things some of them are this big around but there's a butterfly inside of there and count as enemies and also mentors and allies you ever seen you put your hand on a tree or something you look and you didn't know it was there to begin with and you look right beside your hand and there's a caterpillar or something that has camouflaged itself it's hiding from the enemy okay that will mentors and allies that guide and assist through the difficulties Apostles prophets pastors teachers evangelists deacons Elders sisters with the baptism of the Holy Ghost Sunday school teachers let me just you got all of it listen we're not on an island through the fires of tribulation and Chaos a part of the initiate dies and is reborn in other words if you look at a what is that one you call it is indicator did one that that sticks on the side of the tree and all you see is the shell there's a split down the back what cicada you ever seen those that thing once was alive that shell once did something that it did not do it now but it was told what to do from the inside out and it split open and the new person came out or the new bug came out to the fires of tribulation and Chaos a part of the initiate dies and is Reborn resurrected with an Elixir that is taken back to be shared with the Ordinary World everybody listen how many of y'all like to just stand and look at a caterpillar they're fat green and ugly but oh you'll plant butterfly bushes all over your yard what because you want to see the butterfly we don't want to see the worm right that's the Elixir that is taken back and shared with the Ordinary World you become a butterfly and everybody loves to watch butterflies implied within the call is a recognition that that is needed of us butterflies needed caterpillars needed to but the butterfly has got to what the caterpillar never lays an egg the caterpillar comes from an egg that the butterfly Lays somewhere up under a piece of bark or something it makes it through the winter and then when it gets hot enough pops open and here comes an old ugly caterpillar well guess what there's a butterfly in there from the beginning there's a butterfly now watch Through The Crucible of adversity we transform and return to the Ordinary World with grayer wisdom our self-knowledge humility gifts empathy love and other qualities we discover there's more to give and have the capacity now to pollinate a butterfly is a pollinator a bee is not a B's a pollinator two but a butterfly is a great pollinator but that caterpillar never pollinates anything it's useless to a degree we discover there's more to give and have the capacity now to bestow those inner qualities unto others this edification of self deepens us into a more Mythic way of being in the world a higher plane of existing than where we started from from which we can give more of ourself an old an old bug an old um creepy crawly it just I mean it's just you know but how many how many of you just said we got a um hummingbird feeders they they're mesmerizing you can't duplicate that color and you definitely listen the government would love to get the speed of that of that of that hummingbird well they do this do this do this do this do this do this do this and you can't even see their wings they're so fast right that's mesmerizing but now that or a bug on a wall or a caterpillar no what are you saying brother Wade yeah we all started out as a caterpillar we all started out ugly pretty much useless but down inside there was something it just needed to get in the right environment started eating the right kind of food and then what was it what is it for the butterfly to do it's not for just to go hide somewhere it's to give it to the whole world somebody I think Josh and Leah didn't y'all do the butterfly thingy when y'all did the marriage thingy all them thingies huh your engagement yeah it was in a butterfly um Sanctuary Zoo it's not been a zoo ever since I'm trying to make that clear Leah's a good girl I love her to death praying for them all but what mesmerizes people is when the real you comes out number one you're a Mystic to the world they can't understand you how can they understand you know when you're when you're walking through the world and and and something happens and and you know most people that I know you'd be doing this because you knew what was coming a lot of four letters but when you just say Lord or something happens you say Lord forgive me can we not get the brotherly kindness to where we can do that to everybody instead of just being so hateful and have hatred well they don't believe like I believe well I'm gonna hit them all everybody Armageddon it's all of us folks we got pencil sharpening time it's time for us to wiggle and get that thing butterfly out so that we can so that we can share it with the world come on musicians and we'll we'll stop right here the Lord says behold I come as a thief blessed is he that watches and keepeth His Garment unless he walks naked and they see a shame and he gathered him to a place called Armageddon or the hill of the city I know there's a valley but Armageddon means the hill you got to have a two Hills to make a valley the scene of the struggle of Good and Evil let's stand to our feet and suggested by that battle plane of estradeline which was famous for two great victories of Barack and Gideon and two great disasters the death of Saul and Josiah hence in Revelation a place of great Slaughter the scene of a terrible retribution upon the wicked uh this version translates to name as Armageddon the hill or R is the city of mcgetto you and I as brother Ram talks right here the Battle Stars in heaven but it's ending right here in the physical form and the spiritual form you and I are in a battle that poor old caterpillar that butterfly I'm sure I had to do this you know many like chickens and all different things they have to eat their way out that you know they always even in bees if if a bee if you try to help a bee come out of it come out of it so a little cell You Hinder it you you get your at you get your little chicken out of a shell because you want to try to help it because it looks like it's struggling leave it alone it builds character it builds strength by doing it the natural way the bee has to eat that piece around there and has to push a little bit and I've watched them and you see one little tentacle sticking up and it's going then all of a sudden you know it comes back down and you see it moving because it's chewing it it's chewing a little bit more and then you see two tentacles sticking up they're going you know checking the place out but then all of a sudden he eats the rest of it and he opens it up and he comes out he came from a larva stage a little bitty egg it looked like a piece of rice to a bee let the transforming power of God make us into what we're supposed to be there is an end to this to this we talk about Humanity now we're not going to ever see wait a minute maybe we are you were transformed from what you were right some of you a picture like even June like when we got married you know or or right after we got married her hair was this short Shadow maker she's been transformed from that you'll not see that anymore so we are being transformed as the Bible says by the renewing of our mind even literally transformed where the world goes why don't you cut your hair you wear a dress everywhere you go when you gotta makeup on you know why makes you different but you know what it makes you though it doesn't make you odd to be so different to where you just clam up no you say hey the Bible tells us the Bible tells us to not do these things the Bible tells us don't say brother Branham said the Bible tells us that's why I don't understand these people that are leaving the message they're saying brother Brandon wasn't even in the Bible Lord of Mercy what did he preach out of I can read everything he said every sermon he preached you can read it write out of the Bible I don't understand but you know what I just pray they all get the Holy Ghost I wish that one guy on the internet and I can't remember his name but I wished he would put as much effort into learning what this message is about as he does trying to tear it apart he'd be a whole lot better person quit wasting his time and mine because but see they can't leave it alone the devil can't leave this message alone he can't just say well that's your opinion we'll just keep on nope nope we're going to take and your leader we're going to break him down isn't that what they did with Jesus you you a man calling yourself God now we know brother Brown wasn't God but Jesus was okay you say destroy this Temple and it took us 46 years to build this thing you say destroy this Temple and I'll raise it up in three days you say you forgive sins and now what they're saying now same identical thing same devil listen them Devils don't die but they're fixing to they're fiction too there is an end to a demon but there's not an end to you if you've got the baptism of the Holy Ghost let's sing a song God bless you thank you Lord I am thine O Lord I have heard thy born and it told I love to me and I long to rise terms of faith and be closer drawn to me draw me nearer blessed Lord to the Cross where thou Hast e [Music] to thy precious bleed bleeding signs divine [Music] let my soul and I will be lost [Music] butterflies [Music] [Music] draw me mirror blessed Lord to the cross [Music] [Music] [Applause] you see they hadn't they had a narrow Vision we know more about that love than they do now [Music] we can know it now [Music] to the Cross where thou has died draw me nearer [Music] to thy precious [Music] Hi man you love the Lord amen he's good to us amen he's given us something that's it is special it does make you special makes you different but it makes you different it's not you just make yourself different it makes you different I mean you you just take just for a minute you just think back [Music] we used to go to a Baptist Church or or whatever Church you might have went to or a denominational Church they had a they had a what they call the doxology and they had three this and they had two of that and you know I told somebody the other day they were asking me about a sermon and he says how long does it take you to get a sermon somebody at work I think it was I said well oh I know why there's um there's a church to where me and Jim was married at they've changed the name of the church well the little preacher he puts his subject up on this on the outside billboard and gives you the scripture so you can you know kind of read the scripture if you want to and and you know I mean he probably gets it from the denomination but but anyway still so it's scripted I hope I don't want to say that but it is kind of they tell you what to do tell you what to preach and one of the girls asked me she said well well how long does it take you to get a sermon I said well it used to take me a while now it doesn't take me very long I said it doesn't take me long for about an hour hour and a half sermon and they're like you ain't kidding you preach that long I said we get everybody in this building Aaron included get an hour every time right they don't 30 minutes buddy and they're out of here but you see the difference and then you walk into a church and and I'm telling you this is why they're called former powerless that's why they've been taught what they've been taught from a Pulpit that they can just come in the church and they can talk and it's just like it is just like a lodge go visit one sometime not on Sunday but go visit them one time and and you'll see they're just all in the aisles and they're talking about football and they're talking about the Bulldogs and they're talking about you know the painting their house and they're sitting around doing all this around mingling around all the way up here and and no no um reverence at all well where is the holy spirit then if he's timid that's why I I I promise you if you'll start coming to church a little bit early or there's a reason brother Brown said 20 to 30 minutes before the service starts for you to pray and get yourself out of the way it's for you to leave you caterpillar in the car right he taught us these things and we don't do them sometimes and we wonder why we have issues and problems well please don't do what the Lord tells us today and we grieve the Holy Spirit and I don't want to do that I want him to have freedom in this building I want you to get rid of your problems not make more I mean really come on John what you come here for to get more problems no Jesus said dump them on him and that's what we're going to do we're going to dump them on him give the burdens to him and then go outside rejoice and say thank you God for what you did for me today thank you God for what you're going to do for me tomorrow all right y'all remember me on Friday I don't want to have to go through no more of this junk I hate them things man they're horrible if any of you men have been through one forget it don't want to deal with it no more but we have to do what the doctor says just remember Dad too he's got a rash on his body along with all the other um uh issues that he has and pray for him sleeping at night and uh us being able to sleep at night and uh for Mom she's just wore out um but we are family just like you guys it's just it's family and we appreciate
