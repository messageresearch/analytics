TRANSCRIPT
========================================
my heart Lord open the eyes of my heart I want to see you I want to see you open the eyes of my heart Lord open the eyes of my heart to see you name an I want to see you to see you that's your desire to raise him up more power and love as we hold [Music] shining in a man in a minute I want to see him don't you good to be in the house of Lord good to see everybody out tonight we're down some denied you know we had more Saturday night then there is your night I guess cuz we had a pretty good crowd there Saturday night we expect him to be way down but everything worked out it's good to see everybody and had he coming to a close of this year and the ending it up and looking forward to our brother on this coming Sunday night as he brings the word of the Lord unto us and really in the year out and go into another year and that way then we know see we're getting one day closer every day to one way or the other I like what brother Carroll said one time he said Lord don't do something he said I'm going one way or the other I was he was 80 something years old so then that's that's about the truth okay if you like turning these crypts return to Jonah to where we've been reading and then we'll read again on Romans nine that we was there Saturday and try to bring our thought to an end and then the Lord willing after the first of the year try to get into the New Testament because trying to bring the Old Testament part to a close and I hope you've listened because what has been our thought that all the Old Testament is the types and shadows of the New Testament to come all right but then it would have to be that whatever's in the Old Testament would have to come forth into a greater manifestation yes and things but yet would just be more of the same salvation our greater are bringing it into light and understanding it's not changing it it's not you're saved by this over here every what was the point now listening tonight ever what was the point of salvation in the Old Testament has got to be the point of the New Testament right you can't change and have one one thing and one another and then you will see why that it has to be brought in order when we get Darth Jonah to Lord Jesus just bless us tonight as we come to read your word and just let it be you take care of us we love you and we thank you in Jesus name Amen all right what is our thought but I will sacrifice unto thee with the what with the voice of Thanksgiving I will pay that I have vowed salvation is of the Lord and the Lord spake unto the fish and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land let's go over to Roman's 9 because now this relates back because there's a lot of in Romans 9 that is going back and is picking up the Old Testament and bringing it out and that's why I want to keep using it Paul says I say the truth in Christ I lie not my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost that I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart for I would wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren my kinsmen according to the flesh now that's that's a mighty powerful statement to say that you would if you could just take you out of the way Savior your kin folks your kinsmen not just your kin folks but your kinsmen listen for who are Israelites to whom pertaineth the adoption and lowering the covenants and the giving of the law and the service of God and the promises now you could take six months on that one scripture that would be no problem because who are Israelites you'd have to cover that not all the Israel special whom pertaining to the adoption if we study of any adoption in the right across you've got to pick it up from the Old Testament that's my point that's my point is you read those scriptures and it'll keep unveiling the promise of God coming across and whose are the fathers and aluminous concerning the flesh Christ came who is over all God blessed for heaven amen not as though the Word of God hath taken none effect for they are not all Israel which are of Israel neither because they are the seed of Abraham are they all children but in Isaac shall thy seed be called once now that is they which are the children listen they which are the children of the flesh these are not the children of God but the children of the promise are counted for the seat you may be seated the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word now if I get to coughing and sneezing and ice all right don't worry about let me say this now before we get started and the point now there's been too much entirely no deacons deacons are the policemen of the church right why do you need deacons in the church you're not supposed to have deacons to keep the laity people that are members of that church come on they are to control the strangers that come in the visitors and things they should never have to speak to anyone who is a born-again Christian come on if I'm wrong God you show me where I'm wrong the Deacons should never have to speak to a born-again Christian to tell them things it's doing wrong that's why I always say it this way if we're no further up the road then all I can do tonight is preach on her and dress of clothes that's part of the Word of God and it's got its right place glory and we do that but if that's all we can do then let's eat drink and be merry because tomorrow we die then forget the whole thing you know but listen there's been an entirely too much talking I mean coming from backdoor walking up here now get in there and I'm telling you I come up through there a lot of times and I said lord please let them understand people will be sitting talking and me coming up to go into the study I used to look through the window and I see you talking that should never be done Church that should never be done you realize this is the house of God we don't have to have now listen we don't have to have brother branham to tell us the things ought to be done right in the church but we do have a vindicated prophet that told us the way God loved it to be done right we in the Baptist Church we didn't run all over the church and holler and scream you didn't where you came from you didn't do it it's it's an embarrassing to say going on the internet system that a lot of you are just sitting talking and doing things getting up and going into it and a deacon has got to control that when you were born-again christian didn't know what the prophets say it he said nothing shouldn't be spoken here outside of worship and you know what he said meaning right somebody comes up you say something this say meet you outside we'll talk outside Lord bless you there's no problem with saying Lord bless you god bless you there's no problem but when you carry on the conversation now if you don't believe it go back and listen to Saturday services at the end of the service I said it this loud I said no talking it didn't stop didn't even hear me that loud I said I said no talking you don't believe me go play the tape it's embarrassing I should never have to be doing to Christians our deacons instructed visitors comes in if they're talking don't go over to chat up in here now we've got a house of the Lord because you're in worse shape than they are you got the wrong attitude and they have it because they don't know right I'll tell you right now with honesty and my heart is broken you won't stop it you won't stop it you've been told over and over and over not to talk not to let your kids what the prophets say just a kid he said just a kid running in a church would hinder the next service now the next service has got to be six or eight hours later maybe our week later you mean God is that you didn't do it an Old Testament you would have got taken care of in a hurry if you'd have been running back and forth there may be more than what you think even when you're up here you have to come up here in practice come on listen Church see I'll try to say something you don't want us to practice I'll get that before a month from that or a week from now somebody will say that to me I'm gonna say it here you're not supposed to be up here life and hollering and screaming back and forth laughing and talking to each other and kids running up and down the aisle and beating by I started up here last win when whenever there was practicing somebody stopped me from coming up and I'm glad they did I said I've got to go up start they're running oh they're practicing practicing what how to run down stars I could hear a boom boom boom boom bum bum bum or I could hear head down stars the you've offended me brother Dale you know brother would be made a good point one time I've never been that strong but he said if people won't honor and be right and do right in the church they ought not be there I had to agree with him don't not be there if you can't honor and respect the church and the doings up here I'm talking about from the star way up and talking about the tape room I'm talking about the nursery I'm gonna ever work if you can't do it now a lot of you have caught on a little bit with us playing the tape brother branham for about 20 minutes but a lot of your outside yakking talking i mean you ought to be up your listening preachers deacons That's not me we play the tape you were to be up here just down the life and talk okay see when you're up here practice in church you got to call out a song you got to do it honey you got to do that but I come through and walk walking and I hear you just die laughing that's enough this is a house of God this is not a stage or a show thing to put on it's the house of God what if your life in talking would stop someone else from being able to receive that day what they need from God cultures we're trying to get across a point the other day one you know the Bible says will up will give an account right of the deeds done in the body you see we try to make that it's not being born-again Christian but come on it's talking about mourn again Christians and that's what's your profits it and that's what Paul says that's who is talking about what if you just buy some now I'm gonna say it this way some of you sire it up when I started what if that sort of spot hinders the spirit to where it can't work tonight you're gonna give an account someday for that brother day well you want us to do leave the wrong attitude is what I want to leave I've never tried to run nobody off but the wrong attitude shouldn't be around here it's hard to come out here and preach when you got a burden heart for this little silly things or somebody I see you while I'm preaching that you're talking to one another well we're discussing the message don't don't do it the best thing for me to say is one thing you need to you should know better if you're a Christian if you've ever heard the prophets message about the order of the church and I'm gonna say it this way I doubt if half of you have ever heard what wrote a random has said about the church in the order other than maybe what somebody has read to you how many of these ever went into Konak order and doctrine message you just read the whole book and find out what's there and what the prophets said or are we like the brother that was his wife was they were listening to a tape brother branham and brother Branham was laying down pretty heavily on what something that that brother didn't agree with and his wife said you ought to listen to that he grabs the type of slings it out or in the car something's that ain't no man don't tell me what to now where's that person going to be I don't care who's the preacher I mean I don't make light of the Pope I ain't gonna make no light of the Pope cuz you know what he's anointed what if you're making fun of the anointing it's been thinking you're making fun of my hand I made no light of the Pope uh-huh nobody gonna kiss his toe but I ain't gonna make no light of it made it I'll call him brother don't let no light of him okay about it we teach our children to do things what do they do I always told my kids I said you whip him kids for doing something you used to do you're in bad shape you were to explain to them kids the reason I'm spanking you is because I know what I done and what it calls me to do and I want to correct you and make you right that's bad be all right these children are what you never move now okay we end it with the Bible 42 children lost their lives because of the families the mamas and daddies making lot of the profit you said we ain't no scripture for that ain't no Scripture if you'd argue against it for some reason 42 children how did they come up with go up over bald head mom and daddy sitting around at night old bald head 42 children what if your children now you're not gonna like this one at all but you put it down and sit on it what if your children don't want the messages because of you have you ever apologized to your children for being wrong in front of them and no bless God have always been right you need to get an altar you're a liar the olders open you lie you will be up here I've done the best I could do you know we've done the best we could do as human beings but what about our children what if they don't want the message because you didn't present it right bad way to end of year right okay who ended on a good note come the Lord willing if you want to know what whether it's a boy or a girl that brother current and sister Trudy's going going to have there'll be a baby revealing at seven o'clock Sunday December the 31st now when is that that's what's not that's one hour before we start to service right they're going to tell us what they're gonna have okay we're all assured it's gonna be one of the other but you want to know what's coming then you don't have to come Church just come to come to that party and go back home yeah brother to tell you you just get dirty I know it now listen Church if I didn't love you I'd like for you to go hunting with me in one day I'd like for you to go one day and just stay in the woods with me for one day that crowd to God for your souls there were one of you by name pray for God to help us all yeah you think I don't love you if I didn't love you I wouldn't do you the truth I don't have to preach I was reading that today the Prophet and God said I don't have to preach to be saved I don't have to preach to be sunny I'm priest cause I'm saved cuz I'm trying my best to help you understand what life of a Christian should be I'm sorry then if I don't agree you don't agree with my ways of being I'm sorry but that's the way we go okay Lord just help us all to understand we love you and we think in Jesus name okay what have we been doing okay we've been talking about the Old Testament form of salvation all right we firmly stated over and over to you about it that there was a salvation back tyre in the Old Testament of deliverance all right that salvation saved those people it provided them a place to go to when they died proven they were saved because it wasn't that for everybody it was only there for the ones who believed it salvation and knowing that salvation it was back tyre was only as a top because it did not bring them eternal life in their soul you remember how we started out the story of it Adam had eternal life your prophet said it but then Adam died did he go to hell no no he just never reached eternal life in flesh but he was the example that we should have all come that away but we didn't come that way all right so salvation was back there grace was back there we've been over and over and over grace was way before the law grace was before man ever come on the earth grace was before the foundation of the world the lamb stood is you know the slain before the world grace was dire graces the Prophet said is the oldest thing there is they said you got a new religion he said no this is the oldest religions ever been grace so then the old testament would be based upon grace well then surely we can understand that a new testament will come forth based upon grace not greasy grace not this grace but grace that withstand all things and god will bring us to the right place we ended up our thoughts on Saturday night they're speaking about what is the seed of Abraham because the Old Testament salvation now I know he didn't come and I know you got had him I know you got Noah no no you got a lot of people but just remember that the place provided for mankind to go to was thought so much of it would be called paradise yes but what would it be called in the Bible riding the bosom of Abraham which was not a badly of Abraham Hummer it was a carrying device and holding it like him what was it it was the faith of Abraham then do you realize it was almost 3,000 years coming from Adam and Noah and down to to Abraham and all of those people back there was waiting on a faith man to walk out that God could look at that man and say there the man I want Adam was the example you had a lot of problems Abraham was the father what we call the father of faith that's what will end this with it going into the New Testament we got to end it on the faith of Abraham because the New Testament will be the faith of Abraham brought into a manifestation I've got the quotes were brethren and we'll get to it in a minute said what is the seed of Abraham he said abraham believed God then he says now to the Gentiles what is the seed of Abraham to the Gentiles he said the baptism of the Holy Spirit do you realize had there been no man called Adam I mean Abraham there would have been no faith seed and when we start that New Testament why would it be if you have to start the New Testament a justification which is that time only means chopping off we'll get to that see we're going to go over into the New Testament why would it start with justification why would Jesus tell Nicodemus you must be born again you gotta be more into water in spirit you gotta be born a justification Saint case the baptism one only goes and Nicodemus couldn't follow that but that's what the Old Testament declared that's what we we've got to get to see all right who didn't it so marvelous how things would wind up if the Old Testament is going to wind up and get wind up back our being that one man believed God so much I found forward I found another one another day oh how that abraham believed God and it was imputed unto him for righteousness what is the seed of Abraham brother branham it's a faith seed it's not a natural seed put in it odd how that the Bible would declare that Abraham would have many sons that runs at eleven one time he says seven you can argue back and forth that's what gets me in a way that makes me sick for people to argue how many it was instead of taking what brother branham say it if it wasn't but Isaac in each small you got enough to make his point when I found this I found that one I found that for you found out well that's really great makes it marvelous listen what did brother Brennan say from where as we were reading I told him we would not read all of these we would just quote a lot of when the message call to Israel in the church where brother Branham say it he said Abraham had eleven sons but he said he only had one son I promise right only one son from Sarah right one promised son in all of those were his children natural genetic well you go to there what he call natural seed literally from Abraham he never got to promise Ede until he got the change of the body right he went to the believing it circumcisions and got a change of the body then he got Isaac there was the seat of promise okay in Isaac only one promised son I still in Israel in the church well it's a different message one of them was one place one uh only one selling out of how many he had it was the only one that was promised and that was Isaac well I that looks partial don't that looks that looks you know that looks huh it looks like God is doing this thing wrong every one of them other children got blessings and blessings and blessings and blessing even a small got great blessings and great things and said all of this would come out of you and all these thing it was a promise seed to come through Sarah not through Hagar to come through Sarah and it would be then the seed of Abraham by faith he'd be the promised seed so we read it in Romans nine and seven in Isaac shall thy seed be called the Covenant was made with Abraham but then it was made with Isaac and then were Isaac's descendants and from Isaac came Jacob right David all of the coming down through from Isaac Hebrews 11 and 18 says of whom it was said that in Isaac shall thy seed be called one seed come through Isaac Genesis 21 and 12 in Isaac shall thy seed be called not a natural seed promised seed what then is the seat of promise message seeds not out with a shuck number 7 Abraham's seed was his faith seed not natural was his faith seat anything natural 7 a spoken words regional seed three DS what is the seed of Abraham now not his flesh Paul said you that's a Jew outwardly that's Romans what did it 3 or 4 from we're gonna I got it written now is not as you that you inwardly what is the seed of Abraham those that believe the whole Word of God regardless of what denomination Papa mama anybody else says they believe the whole Word of God said I'll establish my covenant right now predestinate this covenant with thee in the seed the drunkies word for yesterday how does God predestinate the Bible says by foreknowledge right by foreknowledge we give the interpretation or thought is what Jacob have I loved and he saw have I hated said even before they were born and what is our answer God knew what Jacob would do in God knew what he saw would do right God knew what you and I did you know out of all the world as I said the other day out of all the world that was back there in the days of Abraham there was not one man could come from the foreknowledge of God down to an earth and God would look at it and say that's my seed what is the seat of God you want to quote the seat of God is the word of God what did Abraham believe God's Word why did God choose Abraham because he would believe in his word why did he choose these Jacob over Esau because he knew on Jacob wanted to birth rights and everything sure shyster true forever bad guy but in the finality Abraham didn't start out too good he stayed Abram all of those years until he got over close to the change for he's even made a brown yet God looked at him and he said that's what it is what about David murderer all kinds of things a dog for ya what does the Bible say about him I almost said God said he's a man after my own heart why because there was something about David that God loved what was it an honest and a contrite heart what did he love about Abraham did he believed him see we could just stop right there in the end of service they're not go home because that's exactly where we start the next service if we're not the seed of Abraham by faith then we're not the children of God oh I don't inside owner and then undo it it's whether or not we can find out what that seed of Abraham what did he say modern events made clear by prophecy faith in the promise word he swore by himself abraham believed God what about that abraham believed God I'm looking for the quote I know it's there but it's the run said if God can get one man he's don't have to help us flew he said if he can get one man to believe his word you know that one man believed enough of God's Word until he entrusted him with the full opening of the seven seals the entire message the whole Word of God because he had one man that would believe him what would you do if a voice spoke to you and says get up take your family leave this country yeah but a good living I've got my retirement plan we've got everything made he said yeah but get out of here he goes in to save her and he says Sarah pack up honey we go and she said where we going he said I don't know I said God told us to go our said a voice told us can you believe that away now let me make another statement if you and I cannot believe God's Word and believe in God the way abraham believed you will never be saved you know that's that fact I'll tell you what I gots getting pretty strapped name strict or not it's based on whether Abraham could believe or not it's based on whether you believe or not Oh a brother Dale I believe I'm saved I believe I'm safe not have these problems yeah spoken word original seed it's a faith seed of Abraham then he believed God I just quoted over these Saturday but a lot of them still there what about it what about Abraham believe in God so much until it brought God on the scene to Abraham you understand what I'm talking about he said but brother Dale I can't believe like Abraham show me one sign I mean asking you for two I'm asking you from one sign that God told Abraham he had to believe you can deal with Moses and the burning bush you can deal with all these other but remember Abraham was the father of the faith not one signer wonder took place before Abraham got out and started walking and I thought we believed the Bible says what if believers signs don't follow believers don't follow signs signs father believers I thought we had that in the order but I just don't see how you you could put everything so strong you mean I've got to believe like Abraham what did they brahim how to believe with Abraham listen folks never had one sermon anybody preached to him about her leaving God he was a healer your prophet said it come from the earth a child these are what it is there anything not one Sun that one sermon at least you heard sermons telling you you need to be saved we've had it what is the faith of Abraham simply to believe God simply to believe him and all the way from glory God came down to Abraham to show him that his believing was what triggered him back dire you know what the words you want to use God saw him before the foundation of the world and you he'd believed him well you're making a chose to know what remember the Prophet said don't predestinate by his desires right till he desired everybody to be safe but you know what he predestinated spy now come on swallow he got it he predestinated by your desire and you tell me that's wrong I thought that we believed that God could not override our free moral agency and save us that we had to accept it yeah but but you're saying except you're saying we got to do something now to get her salvation oh my god do is accept it ain't nothing good you can do there bad you don't do only the one brain guard to you but believing this word Church I know you don't like me and people don't anyway because I just don't play games but when God spoke to me when I was 11 years old there was no way for you to tell me they wouldn't know God you can forget it to this day I was there when it took place and I saw him and I don't have to worry about it that's not trying to make you something where you believe me no but it is making something DIF that around say they've God will do something for one person now listen am i right he said if he can doing one person he said you need to do it for another one if you believe it's the same way has he ever told you something that was impossible I mean impossible to take pleasure and you go tell everybody excellent I play I stood right here many years ago and I said wait it's coming back forget it well you thank God gonna save you cause you'll chop no didn't say that I said God's gonna save him cuz I called for him because God told me that he said you'll be there with your offspring then we moved on down through time and then he was believing with us we were calling for weight and she confessed it to I walked in one day and I told her I said did more than story now honey didn't want I said wait gonna be in the pulpit beside of me this is before he come back to the Lord now he's gonna be in the book the other side of me don't you put your faith out sometime why don't you speak it in the khalaf art when I'm afraid that's what it is afraid you're afraid God ain't talking to you listen Church you can do what you want to about all the things I'm on the spot here ever service because I'm at least here trying to tell you this is what God is telling me to tell you and I've never had to take back one time that he told me now you show it to me anything that he told me I've always stood on it to see if you can't believe God he can't move he can't say you override your free moral agency you've got to accept Jesus Christ as your Savior but what about a great man now wouldn't you want to be counted in the Bible terminologies as being a righteous person you know it says that about Noah we won't say it about you know you know and all and say and you know that that he was chosen of God but we don't read Noah you know it says about Noah that he was chosen he was it was he had us he had something back more God liked it Abraham's faith to believe what the word said to him and told you it's over and over now he didn't have no 20 people to tell him the wait team preachers and no mama and daddy to correct him now you understand what I mean he was standing on his own and believed in God and walked out on his own even when his wife didn't agree with him go ahead let's read these cuz I want to get this on go ahead to number number 10 brother they're doing good keeping up back there so let's read some scriptures it's Genesis 15 he brought him forth abroad and said look now toward the heaven and tell the Stars is the arm be able to number them and he said unto so shall thy seed be and what and he believed in the Lord and was counted to him for righteousness I said wouldn't you want to think about some way that they could be something that God could say that's your righteous you can get all your definitions of righteousness don't worry about I've been through all of them as I'm fine but once you sum it up in one point righteousness would be the factor state of being right if you're right you're not wrong right if you're right you're not wrong if you're not wrong you're righteous those are justified he hath already glorified so God starts it off in Genesis talking about a man that believed him and it was counted unto him for righteousness okay let's jump over Romans for number eleven four and three and what saith the scripture abraham believed God and it was counted unto him for righteousness if you want to have anything to do in God to think about God in any way could impart anything we don't we believe God and he can impute in part cuz it'll get to work go to the next one relations three you got it I make up the other way all right yeah go places three six seven seven even if abraham believed god and it was accounted to him for righteousness know ye therefore that they which are of faith the same are the children of abraham abraham believed god and it was counted accounted who's the next ones james ii during twenty three and the scripture was fulfilled which say it now scripture you see see it was so hard to preach you see you want to stop explaining that right one the Scriptures fulfill that said where was it fulfilled in Abraham brought in to Jesus Christ to bring it into me and you in the scripture was fulfilled which saith abraham believed God and it was imputed unto him for righteousness look and he was called the friend of God what about it jump to 14 there you go romans 419 in vietnam we can faith he considered not his own body now did when it was about a hundred years old you neither yet the deadness of flavors wound he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief who was strong in faith giving glory to God and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was also able also to perform therefore after believing it that way after believing it that way and therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness after he believed it and staggered and all of that all the problems come up look now it was not written for his sake alone that it was imputed to him but for us also to whom it shall be imputed what you got a condition existing in front of you and the written word over there is no condition that's where you don't understand now it was not written for his sake along that it was imputed to him but for us also to whom it shall be imputed if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead do you want to know anything about righteousness why don't you study righteousness on the basis of the fact of it being right and think about justification when you chop off when God remits her sins what does the Bible say about him were they put in the sea of forgetfulness never to be in remembered no more can't be imputed come on I'll quote brother Branham he said you can't impute sin over the token yeah but brother's throwing so done swords oppress what's your so and so what then is the seed of Abraham we've just been through it and they say G swore by himself abraham believed God more than words reading a seed what is the seed of Abraham those that believe the whole word those that believe the whole word you want to be the seed of Abraham I won't be no whew oh you're really smart that's wonderful I know you're just smart enough to be is in him talking about a Jew Abraham would note you there's no relation and Abraham they're calling with you until you come over the New Testament with him she comes from soda and that wasn't until over in the second kings in Judah and one of the other travelers in bondage this way 10m was in bondage that away see we talked about a Jew ain't bran wouldn't no Jew he was a Gentile the Bible said he come from the earth shall these heathen see we've been taught all over LA Abraham's it's you and you all we got to do it be a Jew he's not a Jew our labor to do this inwardly right you see we think we've been taught all of this we think we know and then I come on and say so when I don't know what he's saying I don't understand it because he you've never heard it you've never listened to what it's saying about it it's not a qu that's what you outwardly coach you means chosen and you want the quote from the Prophet I got to let it on the dance it out he said is it's not a Jewish is that it's a promise a promise seed she's called faith he said he believes the promise in the message brought her over to another message called faith he said he looked for God to fulfill his promise but for God to fulfill his promise you know what this is statements I make him I'm harf hard for you to follow he can't make his promise come to pass until he gets somebody that will believe it he's got to have somebody to believe his promise that's what I spent so much time they should have spent a whole lot more on the life of Abraham coming from Abram and all the problems he had he meets God go back on read Genesis he meets God time after time he meets Melchizedek God in human flesh before he ever comes to a change of his names in vain Abraham was a person to who could believe he didn't have no super dooper believe it he just believed it you talk about SuperDuper faith what is SuperDuper faith he knows this thing is SuperDuper faith faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen and read Hebrews 11 all the way down and you'll find every one of them is Old Testament people and what was the connection with every one of them that they had the ability to believe God our faith by faith Enoch by faith Noah by faith by faith that one by what a revelation to them that God had spoke to her what could you believe it like that why can't you believe it - the basis of thinking about that God would choose the people like you and I he would allow you and me to hear this message and to believe it when the world won't have it the religious society won't have this message you know that Oh y'all just make something out of this y'all my son we believe God you know what we talk about a change of the body now Abraham's change didn't come when his name was Abram and it didn't come for 25 years then he got a change a name and everything went through all of that and then he got a change there's all a born-again experience that we'll get to in the New Testament but we end the Old Testament is talking about looking at the basis of God what do you mean brother Daly you're trying to tell me that and all we got to do is believe God well now you tell me some other way I mean I'm open to anybody tell me some other way that anything can take place outside of belief in God now listen sure why don't you believe it right what brought you to where you are some was born in the message yeah we know that but what brought you to this message well I didn't want to that's a good way to start because they brown me didn't either right but see one day something happens you need to say where can we go Lord is that what they said they finally got around enough to believe in God until I could contact him and when he said something to lase is working we go to work you've got the words of eternal life what can we do you don't never sit down and think about I sent down another day in the woods Lord you know I got about four hours I'm gonna review my life you don't never do that don't want to go through my life and I'm gonna think of the good and the bad what I should've done what order done and what I didn't do thinking about your life just thinking about where you come from and what happened in your life you can't think like that and just think about to your life certain things would happen that could have changed your life totally certain situations meeting certain people doing this or doing that how many we all had boyfriends and girlfriends and in that we could have matched somebody else well why didn't we you don't this thinking you just don't think about something and where you come from I tell a lot of experiences that has happened to me about you find out a lot of them things happen to you I told you about the man in the Baptist Church there that come in the church was locked up the guys walking around was right before I left the Baptist I walked in uh said Heidi how you doing he said I just walking around I said hang around with my service in a little while he said nah gotta go I wasn't secured and hollering screaming what are you doing in here we'll get the law after you I just staying well I searched he walked right on that that road the last thing I'd done is walk through the door looked at him he walked right out the road turned and went straight towards Gainesville he said well who was that I don't know I told you how that got in veins you were calling what you won't do but how I saw a person standing in my bedroom looking at me and the first thing I done was grabbed a gun and when I have tremor because he was that real I always had a 357 pistol in the holster hanging on the the bed and what you call it the poster we're all I had to do with just and I just caught it and I said Peggy you go in the room with the boys and it scared me to death it's all that just a fugitive you imagine I said well then one night it him again you know and I just looked up at the door and I seen the same room same persons tenet looking at me I didn't go after a gun I just lay down look just faded away we moved from the ire down to where we live now I always wondered Lord did I move away because you contacted me twice as dreams and Peggy standing with a baby out in the front of the house and all the things and the way it was all laid out and what was taken I carry through a lot if I out and my brother in a dream was working on an old building didn't come down like spaceship I knew what them things mean so I was laying there in the bed not where we're sleeping now but over an other end of the house always wondering what the Lord did I move away should I stayed there I woke up one night and looked re stood as well at least a notice okay they moved I never made that an experience never said that said I was saved never said it made me anything for you to believe but I will tell you who something true if you'll be serious God will meet you somewhere in your Christian experience he will meet you and you will know that it's him see that's why that when I preach I preached with a challenge not to challenge the world a challenge no if I'm wrong come show me but now don't come and say my brother Dale I think you're wrong come on bring all the word we're gonna have a quite a day so we're gonna talk about it that's why I went to preached in 74 I preached that we could pass the Year 2026 and not break bread around message that was nothing said before I still not to take hey folks we whole lot closer to that and you think because what if you took the seven years off to go to Israel you only got another year or so and they're worried about it ain't never made no predictions I just told what I said sitting life and were people and they say you think when I just tell me what happened please don't Daniel 70 weeks that 74 series and still to this day I've never had to change one quote the cult has all been what he said stood before ministers put it out to where they could listen but nobody don't want me my brother branham said if you don't understand Daniel 70 weeks you cannot understand the seals but everybody knows the seals and all about nothing about Daniel 70 weaves what are you trying to say brother Dale try to say one time and God tells me I believe it I believe it brother dad would you tell me this out of the other not unless God allows me he told me one thing years ago that I could do and for five years or more I never done it I never did do it he said it's in your hands no I won't do it you see is not a plaything Church this is serious we think we're ready for a rapture and can't even talk about the message because you hurt somebody's feelings neighbor ahem believe God what if this whole thing is based upon whether or not you can believe God now you want me to get brother branham I got it on my desk but you want me to get him with what he said how many of you'd like to do the works of God you want to do the works of God now who knows the quote the Larry's quoting it back up for me who knows the quote what is it to be able to do the works of God he's shaking her head what is some of you know cause the Bible tells you it's to believe on Him that God sent that's what the Bible says to do the works of God is to believe on him that God sent we believe God sent a prophet right that's doing the works of God that's fulfilling God's Word and here's what your son we believe in the fivefold ministry do we do we really believe in a fivefold ministry that God could still come in today and tell you something and tell you the word just simply believe in God I wrote notes have all kind of try to express it but I can't express it no other way but one time can you believe God how you gonna know when he speaks to how you gonna know when he speaks to you now God will never speak except by his word he said well the delegator then we got the message just keep tapping that old boy then you'll find out he'll back up in a hurry because there's one thing he can't do what is the one thing they can get it he can't bring the word word by word that's your prophet that's wonderful you said well I I've a brother Dale you don't understand me cuz I I know the presence of God I know that sweet humble feeling of the presence of God so do I so did I and I believe in it you heard me tell when I'd ask God to give way to sign about something I could talk to him about and he killed his 10 pointer he's got hanging on the wall and Here I am over in the woods and one side of the woods praying about God to give him the deer and even had a dream of the footprint and the neighbor I went around and showed the neighbors dark the old church was at war was counted jury went back he told he said hey footprint over tire of a deer in the same and said Sam saw a dream with that footprint he told it but there I was I was over on one side of the woods and weight over on the other one God fulfilling his word you know I'm over there I'm having me a boo-boo and I was saying Lord I've asked you you ain't know nothing I'm sorry I'm just tried to believe you said I've asked you this this is a sign and you've never failed me I'm serious he's never failed me yeah that's no joke don't play the Bible as a Ouija board I quit doing it I could stand like that and drop that Bible not because I had something sticking in it I could take your Bible and say Lord I need an answer to this question I drop it and put my finger on the words and read it because I believe God I was crying and saying Lord this is something about that time there was a sweetest perfume you've ever smelled in your life it come flooding that woods where I was that in but I was really upset I said all of this stuff Lord is going on and Here I am some crazy female is up here in the woods spraying perfume I tell it like it is go back over to the truck here comes waiting them and look over in the back there was a big old deer I said where'd you get it or something - Donnelly said I didn't get any way did you know what all cried because see he was trying to show me he was trying to show me I believed him and he took care of it we could stay all night long if you want to talk about God and believe in him but can you believe it brother Dale I've never had this I never had that you don't have to have those signs you gotta believe you got to believe and you saying Lord you know I like the disciples there's good guys when they're bored they say one day Lord help our unbelief where we're going to in the New Testament now either come with the garden must believe that he is you must believe in your heart confess with your mouth everything in the New Testaments gonna be based upon whether or not you can believe it but if you and I can't walk in the faith of Abraham to believe what God has told us you mean naked deprogram you and take this message out of you you mean you could go back to where you came from and be accepted you know what I am a girl's will and the Baptist Church I'm an inactive Baptist deacon you crazy no in the Baptist Church if you're ever ordained a deacon you're ordained a deacon for life go check it out go find somebody ask him ever ordained you're ordained for life they actually honor it more than they do the preachers because you don't hear them saying the preachers ordained a lot he's out the door and three months he's gone they come and ask me said we're gonna make a tree if I don't know it's dark I don't care what they say they won't make a plaque and put all the Deacons in there will you let us do it I said yes sir sure will no problem no problem I'll preach to you what I believe I believe that's gonna be good badness in heaven there's gonna be good Methodist Presbyterian Pentecostals Catholics thank in heaven we might argue about whether or not the bride that ain't got nothing to do with it lose they get there I ain't never said that people right over there ain't going because they're just me and you you start doing that you just a baby side thing with sugar tits trying to make something happen be honest I have no problems with nobody well because what God has done to me he allowed me to believe when others couldn't believe it I never throw it off on anybody ever left his church ain't none of my business no you said well you said someone just easier to truth what I said if it's not you come and tell me right now and I'll go straighten it up didn't uh as you see I wanna be right yeah do you believe God enough to stand on your own by yourself when everybody else is contrary to you come on now when your husband is contrary to you when your wife is contrary can you stand by yourself not stubborn just stand on the word see because that's the only way you're gonna face a New Testament situation because you got to start the New Testament as a man standing there and says you must be born again and the guy that was posting over the whole story says what I do he couldn't understand the simplicity they did what he had to do and that was believed that that man right there was his way to get in the kingdom right come on Nicodemus you didn't have to convince Nicodemus there was a god right he was the guy taught all of it but to believe that that was gone how would you like to have been standing there one of those great religious Pharisees will escort come after in a man walk up to uni look at uni see unless you believe that I am he you will die in your sins so jesus said one day he walked alone you take brother Branham brother Branham walk it alone I think about that man all through his life that he walked alone what a lonely man he would have been had God not been on his side as he walked alone nobody couldn't understand him come on his wife did nobody get it get to message ride nobody didn't understand brother branham he won't alone but he believed God no matter do we believe him can we end the Old Testament is talking about Abraham as being our Father and move with Abraham into a situation because listen Isaac was the only promised seed now out of Isaac come a great nation of people Isaac Jacob Joseph and all down and come all the way to Jesus Christ right not just a little handful of people come to a great nation of people but then when it come to the day today that they met the savior of all that they had they wouldn't accept him he said before Abraham was I am they recognized Abraham right they believed in they brown yeah but they didn't believe Abraham spoke about that kind of a God it would stand there how about you how about me tonight do we believe God is real come on musician do we believe God is real if you don't believe like Abraham did you're not believing God is real what about it can you put everything you got ain't all about money ain't talk about I'm talking about your life can you put everything that you've got on the line and say this is what I believe and stand to word that you know the things has happened in the message and the people and the way they're going in to preachers but can you stand with an anchor faith into your heart and say yes but God is real God is real and go ahead brother well we got understand together take these things home with you and think about it do you believe God what about it [Music] do you bleed [Music] Oh
