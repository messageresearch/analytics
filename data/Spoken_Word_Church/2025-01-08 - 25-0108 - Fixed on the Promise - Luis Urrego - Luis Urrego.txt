really appreciated the inside uh uh Insight of the word that that he's been able to give I mean he preached to a whole room of over 150 pastors and uh some of them probably may not even have heard the things that he had talked to them about and so it was really really really a blessing to them that they are still talking about about this day on because I get the messages and I get things on WhatsApp so we appreciate that appreciate that brother way and and I'll tell you what he is probably one of my favorite persons to interpret for he knows how to work with you so I I'll I'll interpret

continue to pray for her she'll be with back with us Lord will and she'll be traveling back on the 14th amen so let's just go ahead and and go to the word this evening and um I'm planning not to keep you all too long but um just remember each one of these individuals that are sick and I believe brother Terence he's not he's under the weather and some other people and uh so just remember everyone and also this weekend we might have some winter weather coming in isn't that nice yeah we hardly ever see it so we're like yeah my wife's from Toronto and she's like no she's seen it all all the time every there but she's like as long as it's not plowable type snow we're okay so but I don't think we're going to have anything like that but we'll see so just remember that in in prayer so let's just go to the Lord in prayer and then we'll read the scriptures heavenly father thank you Lord once again for the opportunity that you've given us to be here Lord God gathered together father and it might be cold outside Lord Jesus but Lord God we know that your Holy Spirit father God dwelling amongst us father is the fire that is keeping us Lord Jesus even in these times that we are living in Lord God lord I pray that that as time goes forward Lord God and as as as we progress in into this year Lord Jesus we ask heavenly father that you'd help us to not father God stay separated from one another Lord but to to draw closer to one another Lord God more than ever Lord Jesus as as we'll look here in just a moment father through your word Lord God and I pray Lord that you'd help us to keep that in mind heavenly father it's it's uh the this is a Time Lord God where this this this uh Capstone heavenly father has to come down heavenly father and this thing is narrow narrowing down lord Jesus and and those that are truly in Father God those that are truly father God born of your spirit filled with your with your spirit Lord God those are the only ones heavenly father that will dra know and learn how to draw closer to one another Lord God because word seeks word heavenly father and I believe that Lord Jesus we pray Lord that you'd have your way now father remember these that are sick Lord God amongst us and Lord just touch their bodies and Lord and also be with the the ones father that may be uh traveling this weekend and or have to be out in about may you just protect them Lord God Almighty as this system's coming through Lord God we just love you and we commit this time into your hands have your way father God and open your word unto us or we ask these things now in Jesus Christ's name amen amen praise God if you want to turn to the scriptures this morning this evening let's turn to Joshua chapter 3 and uh and uh verse one we'll read first five verses there and then we'll want we want to turn to um Ephesians chap 4 verse 7 Joshua chapter 3 and it says and Joshua Rose early in the morning and they removed from sham and came to Jordan he and all the children of Israel and lodged there before they passed over and they came to pass after three days and it's interesting that that it gives it after three days you know what happened after three days when Jesus was in the Tomb amen he rose after 3 days uh it represents a lot with e eternal life you know and and uh and and it TI tied in with the number eight and things like that so that the officers went through the host and they commanded the people saying when ye see when ye see the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord your God and the priests the Levites bearing it then you shall remove from your place and go after it all right notice that it says go after it it yet there shall be a space between you and it about 2,000 cubits by measure which is uh about a half a mile come not near unto it that ye may know watch the reason why that ye may know the way by which ye must go for ye have not passed this way here to for in other words you have not been this way before so you need to keep your eyes fixed on that Ark and Joshua said unto the people Joshua said unto the people remember Joshua represented the Holy Ghost amen and Joshua said unto the people sanctify yourselves for tomorrow tomorrow amen the Lord will do wonders among you amen praise the Lord now let's turn to Ephesians chapter 4 verse 7 amen but unto every one of us is given Grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ so each one of us plays a role in the body of Christ as as it tells us right there amen wherefore he Seth when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive he's talking about Jesus Christ and gave gifts unto man now now that he ascended what is it but that he also descended at first into the lower parts of the Earth all right he that is he that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all Heavens amen that he might fill all things thank God amen amen I'm part of those things you'd be you're part of those things and he gave some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers all right notice a conjunction there pastors and teachers that's right right that's very interesting all right for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ that's the reason why he gave these this five-fold ministry right till till until we all come into the unity of the faith all right right right that's very very key and that's what I want to I want to stress this in this hour until we come to the unity all right Unity comes from the word uh one amen which means Union right just one one one unit am right and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ amen and watch this is this is the reason that we henceforth be no more children amen amen no more children right tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of Doctrine or just anything that anybody says is influencing you right we we're not to be that way anymore by the slight of man what is slight by the trickiness of man and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in weight to deceive right but speaking watch this but speaking the truth in love amen May grow you may grow up into him in all things this is not a partial possession amen of of The Inheritance this is a fullness of The Possession amen which is the head he is the head even Christ amen so you may be seated this evening praise the Lord amen I just want to talk this this evening um amen and I just want to title this fixed on the promise amen and fixed on the promise and I I I believe in this hour saints that we have so much that that that could keep us away from our eyes a having our eyes fixed on the promise amen we live in an hour that where where everything is clamoring for our atten attention everything wants our attention everything wants your attention amen and it's up to you to decide if you're going to give it the attention or not amen does God deserve the attention he always deserves attention amen when God is the one who created you God is the one who placed you here in the hour that you're living in you are not here at this very moment amen just to be here or just to feel space or to feel time you are here to fulfill his word for your for this hour amen you are here in this hour amen because you have a role and a part to play in this in the body of Christ amen you're not here just to you're not here just to Ju Just to be a listener and and not a doer or just to to to to receive and not give out you're here to receive but to also give out amen you have just much a part of this as anybody as the preacher does as the pastor does as the Deacon does as anybody else does Amen that you might think is is so highly and so respected you have a part to play in this as well amen amen I don't care if you clean to church I don't care if you if you're the one who who who who who who warms up the food down there for the people coming in amen you have something to you have a part to play Amen in this hour amen and and if we can if we can look at ourselves that way that that's the way God sees us Amen in this hour praise God that's the way God sees us amen and that we are a a part of his body amen and his body is one unit amen his body is a unit and he's the head amen and whatever the head goes that's where the body goes amen praise the Lord Jesus we appreciate brother emanuel's mom I guess being here or the sisters the sister's mom amen God bless you Sister good to have you here with us praise the Lord any other visitors I may I may be overlooking God bless you all amen praise the Lord Jesus so we just thank God Amen God's God's the one who put us in this body God's the one who made us part of the body amen praise God and and and if God made us aen nobody could take us out amen if God put you in nobody can take you out praise God if you've been sealed in the devil's sealed out hallelujah amen that's why it's so important this hour Amen to be filled with the holy spirit because that's not just you being filled with him but that's also you being sealed in with him amen and you whatever sealed in amen you it's hard to come out amen it can't come out you know I remember one time you know we had this leak uh from our shower up up there and it was coming down in in our living room and uh and so I went in there found the leak and I I got this thing offline you know it's a at scene on TV type product you know hey but you know what it worked it worked and that when you I I put that thing in there and and and and let it dry out and everything and and and it stopped stopped the leak it was coming from around the shower uh drain and so it was going out outside of the drain coming into the our living room so far it's been a couple of years there's no leak it's been sealed out the water that water has been sealed out you know and so no more problems amen that's the same thing with the Christian amen when you're sealed in amen by the Holy Ghost amen there's no issues then amen issues might come amen but there's a barrier the Holy Ghost is right there stopping it for you hallelujah amen because why you're depending on his word you're depending on his seal amen praise God Amen so we see here saints that uh um that the children of Israel they they we know that they received a promise back in in uh the times of of of of Abraham he had G been given a promise uh to that they were going to possess a land amen and that promise when God says something Saints amen he's going to fulfill his word amen he doesn't say anything just to fill space he doesn't say anything amen he is not a one that lies he's not like you and I amen he's amen he keeps his word I'm so thankful for that that we have a word amen in this hour that's true amen that's alive amen that's the that's the that's the best thing of all it's a living word in this hour and that word was given to to to uh Abraham and Abraham all he had to do was just continue walking in that amen he didn't know when it was going to come to pass he didn't he was he was told that his his seed shall possess the gates of his enemy that he would his seed would be like the stars of of the sky the sand on on the shore and all these things he didn't know when that was going to happen but all he had to do was continue walking day by day oh Saints we we got so many wonderful promises in the word in this hour amen and sometimes we wondering well what's going to happen here what's going to happen this what's going on right here what's happening that amen just keep walking in what you have right right now stay with what you have right now amen that's all Abraham could do was just walk in what he had at the moment amen and then as he continued to walk the Lord would reveal more to him and just keep walking Abraham just keep walking I am the one I am God I I am I this ien amen I like what brother Wade was one of the things that we were telling the he was preaching there to the people in Honduras amen was that God was telling Abraham that he was the one who was going to keep the promise amen not Abraham amen it was it was an unconditional uh Covenant amen and so that mean Abraham was the one I mean that God was the one who was going to fulfill that word amen oh I'm so thankful amen that's under the Covenant that we're living in in this hour that God is going to fulfill it amen praise the Lord Jesus amen you do your part amen your part to believe God will do the rest amen and that just keep walking in what he's already given you now well I don't know about the seals and I don't know about Daniel 7 we keep walking with what you got right now amen God will lead you exactly to that point amen just stay with what you have now amen that's all God requires you to do amen stay in the word that you have right now amen don't get so fixated and it's very important that we get more word but the more word that you receive is is is is if you're walking in the word that you already have amen you'll receive more word if you keep walking in the word amen each step that you take it's a present step amen you if you take that step then you'll get to the next step you see amen so you have to keep walking that way and it was given to the to Abraham that they will have a land amen praise God to possess amen and the children of Israel finally that that promise amen because remember God doesn't lie that PR same promise came through Moses amen and Moses was told amen that that there was his people were going to possess a land praise God that that was flowing with milk and honey Moses didn't know how it was going to happen amen but eventually he was the one to lead the children of Israel out of Egypt and we all know the story we all know what happened amen it came to the point where that original generation amen all of them pretty much passed away that's right they did not make it to see the Promise amen but there was the second generation that rose up amen oh my we see a second generation rising up in this hour amen we see we see a people amen that are about Amen to see This Promise fulfilled Amen in their very own lives amen I believe that somebody's going to fulfill amen first Thessalonians praise God Amen wa who do those who are alive and remain shall not prevent those amen who are asleep praise God and somebody's going to see a body change I just I might as well believe it's me amen praise God and you might as well just believe it's you because we're living in that hour amen praise God where those Saints amen they shall rise praise praise God and then we will be caught up with them amen to meet Jesus in the air amen I always stress that promise because that is something that yet hasn't been fulfilled but I believe it's working in this hour amen praise God and somebody's got to fulfill it Amen brother brandom couldn't do it amen not even Jesus could do it amen praise God somebody's going to have a body change while they're alive amen somebody's not going to see death praise God Amen oh I'm so thankful for that Amen in this hour amen praise God and so here's the children of Israel and they're getting ready to cross over into Canaan praise God and so right as there before they they're getting ready AC cross we know in in in chapter two that that Joshua sent the two spies and uh Rahab was on the scene there and and we know what happened there and they came back praise God knowing that God was going to give them that that land amen those two spies were giving positive confession amen even Rahab knew that that land was theirs am she said for we know we know that when you come in amen we know that this land is yours we know that God has already given you this land and she did everything that she could to try to make sure her family was able to get in amen praise God she did all that she could Amen to make sure that her family was saved and that she was saved that she had that token ready amen ready to go out ready to show it amen praise God because Joshua was coming through amen and he better see that token Hallelujah that's right amen praise God that's the reason why Joshua wasn't with the two spies amen but when he saw that token he said he told the two spies he said go get Rahab amen and he he made sure personally to go get Rahab amen praise God oh this in this hour Saints amen God's going to personally make sure that this bride is is protected in this hour amen that he'll have a bride amen without spot or wrinkle praise the Lord oh my thank God amen amen so here they are here at the border of of the of of of crossing over into Canaan and we know that Canaan Canaan represents amen the the the life in the holy spirit amen uh I know sometimes people call it as Heaven amen but brother brandham said that you know it to him it wasn't Heaven because when they crossed over into Canaan they still had to fight they still had battles they still had things that they had to face praise God and brother brandom actually typed the Book of Joshua with the book of Ephesians which is which is uh uh the the the Book of Joshua the main theme of the book of Joshua is possession amen praise God and if you look here in in in Ephesians chapter 1 verse four verse 13 uh if you want to read with me there those those who if you have your the word it says here in whom well let's read from verse 12 that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ in whom ye also trusted after that ye heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation in whom also after ye believed you were sealed with that Holy Spirit of Promise oh my thank God for his holy spirit amen watch this in verse 14 which is the earnest of our inheritance in other words which is the down payment of of what God has already purchased for you amen and do you realize that the children of Israel that land was already theirs all they had to do was just go and possess it amen all they had to do is just get up amen and just go in and possess what God has given them praise God God the Holy Ghost is yours Saints amen healing is yours amen all these blessings all these promises from God they are yours in this hour amen because they belong to his wife amen and if you are part of him amen praise God they belong to you hallelujah praise God which is the earnest of our inheritance until watch this until the Redemption of the purchased possession amen praise God it and I like I like the way it says it in the past purchased amen but we must it's already yours right praise God but we must continue on Amen until the Redemption of the purchased possession what purchase possession amen the children of Israel had that land the physical land we got to purchase possession to amen that we're looking to Amen to also overcome as well amen amen put unto the praise of his glory now so the children of Israel when they crossed over and eventually we'll read it here they had to fight after that because right right after that was Jericho they had to go in even though God had told them and they knew the two spies had already told them even Rahab amen had said that that land is yours that that city is yours God has given you amen but the children of Israel had to obey the word praise God the children of Israel had to obey and had to go physically possessed amen and this sour Saints amen it's not enough amen that you just know it it's not enough that you just know go and possess in this hour praise God how how am I going to possess how am I going to get amen you're going to have trials oh I know we don't like to hear that we don't like we don't like to hear that word a trials you know we don't like to hear uh problems come up amen because because well that's problematic to hear those words we don't like that but that's what molds us that's what that's what molds our character that's what that's what that's what actually draws us closer to God Amen puts us on our knees amen and and makes us pray and makes us seek him more Amen in this hour praise the Lord sometimes amen God has to amen cause friction amongst the Brethren amen for them to realize amen I need that person really that person probably needs me too amen and he might cause friction amen and you might think I I don't I could Google I could do away with that person amen but you really need that person that's right brother brandham said that if a brother or sister amen that you have ought with if he passed he or she passed away you would feel so bad in your heart if you truly are a Christian amen and so this is what we're talking about this is what Ephesians deals with these little things that we leave undone and we think we're okay we think that it's okay Amen to just go in life and go to church not talk to anybody and just have just just just go and and and just have a with people who just wherever we want to amen and smart off at people and say I know y'all start getting quiet when we start talking like this but this is how it is and it's just it's okay to just go to church and just be that way amen and just to treat people however way it is I'm not saying anybody here specifically they do that amen CU I I've been there too sometimes you get attitudes with people and you get and you get things amen that that that in reality then you go back and sit down you think about it and you're like I really shouldn't have thought that way I really shouldn't have said that I really shouldn't have have acted that way amen praise God I'm so thankful amen that a true Christian thinks like that amen amen but if you don't feel anything when you do something to somebody or somebody amen if you don't feel that way go check up it's time to check up amen if you feel like well I'm just kind of better than them and I'll just you know you know something's wrong with you something's wrong with your experience amen so I don't even know how I got into that somebody must have needed I I needed it but that's the hour that we're living in Saints right we need to check our individual these things that would that that that that we leave undone sometimes amen praise God so here the children of Israel they were getting ready in go in to possess and the Bible says here in Joshua chapter 3 it says let's just read verse one again it says and Joshua Rose early in the morning and they removed from sham and came to Jordan he and all the children of Israel and lodged there before they passed over amen so they they they they they stationed for a while amen but they didn't put their Stakes down that's the important thing amen they they didn't they didn't they didn't have in mind that I'm going to put my steak down to be there forever amen sometimes God gives us a a time of of re rest relaxation and no problems amen but don't put your stake down on that and think that that's how life is going to be always some of you already know that that's not how it is amen we've all had problems in life and trials amen and you've come to realize that you can't have your Stak down in something amen and think that things are always going to be that way amen something's going to come in and just change it all up for you why for your own good for your own good because God knows amen that you can you can overcome amen otherwise he wouldn't give you that specific trial he knows that you can overcome that's the reason why you went through the trial or you're going through the trial amen praise God and it came to pass after three days that the officers went through the host amen and I I as I mentioned you know the the three days having to do with Resurrection eternal life amen you can just go look at that at your at your own time and they commanded they commanded the people saying when ye see the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord your God and the priests the Levites bearing it amen I want you to realize and and remember that the Ark of the Covenant amen represents the word amen amen because inside the Ark of the Covenant is where you had uh the the the Ten Commandments the uh the Aaron's rod and they also would put the Mana in there as well the original Mana that fell amen the first time when the children of Israel were in the wilderness so it was a very it represented God's presence amen amen that's where God was dwelling at the moment amen and so it was very important amen that they that the children of Israel watch watch the way it says it amen and the priests the Levites bearing it that ye shall remove from your place and go after it amen amen who was the one bearing the the the the the Ark of the Covenant it was the Levites or the fivefold ministry of that day amen praise God you have to make sure amen and recognize amen there's a five-fold ministry that's holding the Ark of the Covenant in this hour praise the Lord amen that have been given have been in in trusted with that amen praise God but you are to look at the Ark of the Covenant and not at the five-fold ministry amen you're supposed to look at the word not supposed to look at the man amen and we're going to read something here in just a moment amen yet there shall be a space between you and it about 2,000 cubits by measure come not near unto it that ye may know that you may know the way by which you must go amen for ye have not passed this way here to for Saints amen and and I just want to encourage you that in this in this in this year amen this New Year pray if you could just call it a New Year's New Year's uh uh uh sermon amen we have not been this way before Saints right amen we have not we have not this is we have never been a 2025 amen we have never experienced even some of the things that we are seeing now we have never experienced it before amen but you have not been this way before but you you need someone to Lead You In This Hour amen you need someone amen you need to get into the plan of God Amen and watch that word amen and let the word guide your thinking in this hour amen because if it doesn't guide your thinking amen someone else will guide your thinking amen someone else will have your thought process amen and someone else and it it'll be nothing but the devil because that's what the devil wants to do amen and so you got to make sure that you keep your eyes focused on the word amen the word is the most important thing in this hour and if it doesn't say it amen if the word doesn't say it make just leave it alone amen it may not be bad amen it may not be something bad but if it doesn't say it if it doesn't align with God's plan from Genesis to Revelation amen leave it alone it's the best thing to do amen amen it may not be necessarily bad thing it can't be just for you amen but if it doesn't allign with the word leave it alone amen that's the best advice I could give on on on that because we're seeing so many things going on around us amen praise God and Joshua said unto the people verse 5 and Joshua said unto the people sanctify yourselves for tomorrow the Lord will do wonders among you amen so even though they were with Joshua even though they had the word the message for their day the word of the hour amen Joshua the leader was there with them the Holy Ghost amen they still have to sanctify themselves amen I believe in this hour amen that you still have to repent I believe in this hour that you still have to and make sure look at your life see what I can clean off of me amen see what I what what am I doing wrong where am I failing you Lord amen you might have been in this word amen for 50 years amen you still might be failing in in an area amen find out amen there might be things in your life amen because let me tell you we've never been this way before you better make sure you're walking in the word amen you better make sure that you're walking fully in in in in Christ and know where you're standing in this word amen praise God so sanctification is not just a one time thing amen sanctification is a whole process amen throughout the whole amen life of a Christian amen praise God Amen I believe that we're still learning and and and and recognizing this is probably not good for me to continue doing this is probably not good for me to continue watching on this is probably not good for me to continue listening to right man sometimes we may not get the Revelation amen right down here amen sanctification to to leave certain music or to leave something amen and we might still be be be going amen but but but eventually amen that God will give you that re amen the Holy Ghost is the one that does the work that's why we don't condemn amen people amen if a sister comes in here and man she's got bobbed hair short hair leave it alone let the Holy Ghost do the work amen the Holy Ghost will reveal amen amen and eventually the sister amen will realize wow you know the sisters here they got long hair and and what am I doing you know and and uh and then they'll realize wait a second this is a work of the holy spirit amen and it's not necessarily because others are doing it I'm doing it you know no it's not about that amen the Holy Ghost let the let the Lord do the work amen that's right praise God I remember you know when I used to I used to you know I I used to wear shorts and you know when I was a teenager and stuff and you know that's that's up to you if you if you do that I'm not condemn that you know that's between you and God but that this is my personal revelation when I came into the message in 1999 I came from denominal churches and as I've always said I came to I came through the seven Church ages of denominations I've been to denominations I know about baptist I know Catholic Jehovah's Witness Wesley and Pentecost I've been through those things I know what that's like so I know that when I came to the message I know what God saved me from some people the reason think they don't know what God has really saved them from because this is all they know amen but when you know where God saved you from amen oh God Amen you walk different then and you do things and you and you and you and you reverence God more amen but this if this is all you've known amen then you you you you just walk like like it you know doesn't things don't bother you amen and it's okay it's a personal revelation between you and God I'm not saying that I'm better than than you amen I'm just saying that that's what God revealed when I heard brother brand said those cees those CeCe ones that wear shorts amen I said I Ain wearing them anymore that's right am that was my Revelation amen right amen that summer amen that was summer of 99 amen I stopped amen why because it was a prophet that said it amen but we realize you know now those thing that they that I had it I'll just leave it alone there there's the just go study it out yourself but anyways that was that was my I just giving you as an example right let God do the work see when God does the work then I don't have to tell you know anybody to stop doing this you don't have to tell your daughter or your or your son stop doing that Amen Let God do the work amen praise God just take him to the Fountain let the fountain do the work amen and the work will be done praise God Amen oh I believe that with all my heart amen when God does it he does it right amen amen we I as parents you know we just get tired amen stop listening to this stop doing this stop amen but but but amen when God does it oh my when you say Lord here are my children here is my family uh they're in your hands oh my amen you just wait and God will do something because God said that's exactly where I wanted you that's right now let me just take over now that's right amen yes PR praise God am amen amen yes sir hallelujah amen oh my I feel good tonight I feel like I'm under the tent in Honduras praise the Lord yeah brother wait know how brother Aaron you know what it's like to fill be under the tent amen amen praise God Amen you all are pulling so nicely thank God and Joshua verse 6 and Joshua spake unto the priests saying take up the Ark of the Covenant watch this is Joshua now speaking Joshua take up the ark uh uh take up the Ark of the Covenant and pass over the people and they took up the Ark of the Covenant or the word amen and went before the people now that means that word amen they have to go by them at some point amen you see the the Lord told the Lord through the through the helpers or through the people there in that in in that hour said keep a distance right but amen eventually that word has to come by through amen it has to come by at some point praise God oh my the word's going forth don't let it don't let it pass you by Saints amen don't let that word pass you by amen and and not have that word affect your life praise God Amen and they took up the Ark of the Covenant and went before the people and the Lord said unto Joshua now this is the Lord speaking Amen to the messenger of that hour this day will I I Lord himself begin to magnify thee Joshua in the sight of all Israel amen that they the children of Israel may know that as I was with Moses so I will be with thee amen oh my praise the Lord Jesus I'm so glad that when brother brandham left the scene amen God didn't leave us comfortless amen when Jesus left the scene he said don't worry amen I'm not I'm going to go but I will leave I will leave you I won't leave I won't leave you comfortless you'll have somebody here that will make sure to give you comfort and it won't be just be right next to you amen right brother God he'll be in you amen it's a better it's a it's a better thing to have the person in you amen instead right next to you amen cuz right next to me amen they can just go they can leave at any point amen but when they're inside of me they're with me all the time amen praise God you carry them wherever you go amen praise the Lord amen that Holy Ghost amen he said that he'd be with you even in you Amen to the day to the end of the world praise the Lord and that's what he promised amen and I believe your Holy Ghost filled in this hour amen I believe that he's fulfilling that promise in your life at this very moment amen praise God oh my some people might have thought oh my when brother Brandon passed away that was it oh we don't we're just not not amen but the Holy Ghost never died and that message never died that message is still with us amen amen praise God I know that the messenger and the message are one amen but what was more important what I needed was that message amen praise God but that's that that just that just goes to show amen that that's that that you need also the messenger in order to have the message amen as we're going to read here in just a moment and the Lord said unto Joshua this day will I begin to magnify thee in the sight of all Israel that they may know that th as I was with Moses so I will be with thee and thou shalt command the priest this is still God speaking that thou shalt command the priest that bear the Ark of the Covenant saying when ye are come to the brink of the Jordan o of the water of Jordan ye shall stand still still in Jordan now I want you to realize saints that Jordan you know it represents many things it represents death it repres represented many things but this was a a river that the children of Israel had not ever crossed this is the first time that they had come to this point amen and I believe sometimes you know we it's the first time that we experience things in our life certain issues certain problems amen but if you just keep your eyes fixed on this word amen as God was telling the children of Israel or was telling Joshua to tell the people amen let them keep their eyes on the word the word will be able to guide them through those problems through that individual a remember problems don't have eternal life they have a beginning that means they have an End Amen praise God if they if they're there they were created whatever was created doesn't have eternal life amen praise God hallelujah and so God is the one who only have he's the source of eternal life and if you come from him amen praise God you have that same life Hallelujah so you're not a problem before God Amen you're his eternal attribute hallelujah praise God and Joshua said and thou shalt command the priest that bear the ark now watch what he says here in verse eight and thou shalt command the priest that bear the Ark of the Covenant saying when ye are come to the brink of the water of Jordan you shall stand still in the Jordan amen sometimes that's the best thing to do when problems come stand still and see the salvation of the Lord and Joshua said unto the children of Israel come hither amen come hither and hear the words of the Lord your God Amen and Joshua said hereby ye shall know this is the what you shall know that the Living God is among you amen and that he will without fail amen drive out from before you the hivites the the the the Canaanites and the Hittites and the hites and the parasites and the girgashites and the amorites and the jebusites praise God now we know what God had told the uh Joshua but but Joshua gave it a little bit more meaning Amen in some in some scriptures it says and and and Joshua added Amen in other words now we don't add to the word amen praise God we we continue we we preach what has already been preached amen I I don't I don't I don't have the word a word of my own brother Wade brother Bob brother Aaron don't have anything of their own amen that that will just make you just uh uh just oh and oh wow no we're just preaching the same thing the prophet preached amen the word amen praise God because we are we are ministers under the messenger amen praise the Lord Jesus but Joshua amen the Holy Ghost he added a little bit more to it amen and brother brandham said that in this hour amen that there will the the the ministry amen that five-fold Ministry we'll take the things that were said and we'll give it more meaning amen praise God Amen and that's very important in this hour amen praise the Lord because well that's the reason why we need a living present day Ministry amen praise God Amen the things amen what does it do you good young people if I talk about Elvis Presley it doesn't it's good to know amen the roots of that and and and and and and and the and and where rock and roll and all that start started happen it's good to start with Elvis Presley but I can't tell you amen don't listen to Elvis Presley cuz I know you ain't listening to Elvis Presley amen that's right amen you're listening to other things you're listening to the whatever is out there right now little Nas or whatever amen I don't know what's that you know that that's all you know whatever you listen to amen I hope that you're not amen amen I hope that you got Holy Ghost filled that that you're listening to Good gospel Christian music amen something that'll help you amen but but you see it doesn't benefit me Amen to speak about those things Amen to to you so you got to you got you have to have a five-fold Ministry to come down amen and and take those things that brother Bram said give it more meaning for in this hour amen praise the Lord Jesus and that's very very important amen because we're speaking to a multi-generational congregation amen sometimes we're just so fixated just say it the way the prophet said okay that's fine that's good but what did the prophet say let me take it so that I can put it into action in this day amen that's what the fful ministry is there for amen praise the Lord so it's taking the exact same thing that God said or the message says but added more meaning to our present day oh my praise the Lord that's what we need amen you need to pray for the fivefold ministry amen so that they could find the mind of God Amen and I don't want to know about all your problems and things like that amen I just want to be able to preach and and let God speak to your problem amen praise God cuz God's the one who knows I don't let God do it amen and he'll do it really good praise God Amen and Joshua said hereby ye shall know that the Living God Amen why it's because through a living Ministry is among you and that he will without fail drive out from before you and then all right we see that and um verse 11 behold now Joshua is still speaking behold the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord of all the Earth amen I like the way it says it there passeth over before you into Jordan amen now there therefore take you 12 men out of the tribes of Israel out of every tribe of man and it shall come to pass as soon as the souls of the feet of the priest that bear the Ark of the Lord the Lord of all the Earth shall rest in the waters of Jordan that the Waters of Jordan shall be cut off from the waters that come down from above and they shall stand upon an Heap amen the children of Israel in that hour Saints they had to listen to that and have faith in that word now put yourself in their in their in their I won't say shoes or sandals in that hour put yourself in their shoes in that hour you're sitting here listening to the man of the hour and he says that God spoke to him these things amen and that you you're getting ready to cross a treacherous River man because it was there there's certain times of the year where it was very treacherous to cross over that Jordan River amen and so anything could happen and there's a lot of people crossing over and you're listening amen and you have to you have to have faith that what Joshua is saying is helping you amen oh my amen and this hour sayings you have to have faith amen that what the PE some what's being said behind the pulpit is helping you in this hour that is the Holy Ghost and that it's not just the man or it's not just just just that brother or you know but it's God Amen speaking directly to you God knows your needs amen praise the Lord Jesus God knows exactly how to speak to the situation amen and so all this all this did not work amen to go and possess something did not work if Faith was not involved no right Faith had to be involved Saints amen so you have to have a level of faith in this hour amen that what's that that the word that's going through amen even the word that you listen to at home that the that the tapes amen and and even anything that you might listen to online amen Lord Jesus help me father to receive something that would speak to my need the word that you read amen if you take the word of God that way amen I guarantee you God will speak exactly what you need there's been many times where I have gotten the the Bible picked up the Bible and I said Lord you know my need you know that I have this issue and I just open up the word amen maybe I might not have a specific place that I uh that I I wanted to read just open up the and as soon as I open up it's right there the need my need met amen and I know that many of you have probably experienced the same thing amen you know brother Brandon he had an experienced like that remember when when uh or it was mey I was was Sister mey when when he said when she was uh I guess she was doubting or you know with regards to brother brandom and his ministry and and or or it was before they got married I believe it was it was before they got married and she was wanting to know the will of the Lord she wanted to know the will of the lord lord should I marry brother brandom you know I I do like him and I really but should I and she opened up the word and she opened up to Malachi chapter 4 behold I send you Elijah the prophet it was as simple as that amen now you go back in the tapes and listen brother brandom tells that story amen that was her that was her uh that was her confirmation so the Lord has a confirmation in the word for you in the messages in whatever amen praise God all right I'm I'm I'm winding down amen W I feel like I've been interpreting for brother Donaldo and as they and as they that bear the ark were come unto Jordan in other words the the fful ministry the priests come unto Jordan and the feet of the priest that bear the ark remember the ark represents the word were dipped in the brim of the water for Jordan overfloweth all his Banks all the time of harvest that the waters which came down from above stood and Rose up on and Heap very far from the city Adam that is beside zaratin and those that came down toward the Sea of the plain even the salt sea failed and were cut off and the people passed over right again Jericho amen amen exactly what the Lord told them through Joshua they took it by faith and they crossed over that that way that they never had been through before they did exactly what God told them to do keep your eyes fixed on the on on the word amen amen when you keep your eyes fixed on the word and take it in by faith you're going to be able to cross over you're going to get through your problem you're going to get through your issue and this verse 17 and the priest that bear the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord stood firm on dry ground in the midst of Jordan on dry ground you see God Amen doing the exact same thing that happened in at the Red Sea with Moses and all the Israelites all not not one amen amen possession means amen a full amen something full amen nothing partly nothing half amen when a devil possesses someone that means it's taking full control right and that word possession means fullness right and that's what God wants Amen in this hour he wants full control in this hour amen that's and he wants you to take the promises his promises in full possession Amen in other words embrace them in this hour and don't let them go like Jacob said I will not let you go until you bless me amen until you meet my need and and and and and Jacob had a need in that hour amen and and he said I'm not letting go of the promise until it's my need is met praise God that's how you need to be with God Amen that's what God wants to see but sometimes what we do is is Lord I have a need oh Lord yeah and and and I prayed I prayed and and and and and then if God doesn't mean it oh well I guess it's not for me amen you better continue continue beli in that word God said it's yours amen and if he said it's yours keep trusting keep by faith amen keep believing don't lose faith and all the Israelites passed over on dry ground until all the people were passed clean over Jordan amen praise the Lord Jesus amen now brother brandom says it like this he says this in in the message Shalom this is a new day Hallelujah this is a day that we should rise and shine Amen in the power of Jesus Christ he says gross Darkness settling upon the Earth there should be a new day for us yes how how many believe that there's gross Darkness settling upon the Earth amen yes indeed doing it just the way he does it but turn to his word amen and see the Promise that's promised for this day and you'll know whether you're living in daylight or not amen amen and then he says changing the calendar doesn't change the time n it only changes the calendar right amen so from December to January didn't change the any any the time didn't change the events events are still going they change amen but but are what's God doing to change you amen what are you doing to change amen what are you drawing closer to his word come on Amen or did you just make just a a New Year's resolution and said uh you know because people most of the time don't keep New Year's resolutions amen by the fourth day they're not doing what they said that they were going to do amen that's why they say gym memberships are are are high the first week of January amen after that they they're just they kind of balance out fizzle out again wow because people feel yeah yeah I got this i got this and you know we feel that way when we first come to the Lord amen I got this yeah praise God people get excited about God and the message amen and you've seen them here amen they'll stand right they see here hallelujah amen amen they're so excited about God and then when those problems when real life hits him when it's time to cross over and they see oh my I I thought we were just crossing a creek that whole place is flooded that Jordan that's the Jordan I I mean you know I thought we were just going to fly over you know you know and just and just cross the you know like like AIC Jordan you know just just fly over you know our problems you know but that's not that's not how it is you know that's not how it is and then that's where people fizzle out and you realize you know people a lot of people don't have what they say they have they they think they have you see so stay with the word Saints amen praise God Amen and let's let's just read real quick Philippians chapter 3 and I'll end with this Philippians chapter 3 verse 13 says bre I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do this is Paul speaking forgetting those things which are behind amen 2024 is behind us amen a lot of things happened and many things amen that that that uh you know that might have caused us sadness and and and but but you know what live leaving them behind amen amen that's what Paul's saying here but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind amen and reaching forth unto those things which are before Amen in other words reaching forth those things which are right in front of you do not fail when you are at the bank of the Jordan don't fail right there amen you're getting ready to cross over amen you're don't fail amen when you're right there about to receive the Holy Spirit don't fail right there and you've come all this way Amen to fail right there to to get obtain your healing to obtain the promise that God has given you don't don't don't don't fail right there don't don't get laxed on God right there when you're about to receive God's promise amen praise God forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before us cuz they're right there before you amen amen press toward the mark for the price of the High Calling amen this is the price that God has given you it's a high calling amen the body change that's a high calling right amen not everybody's going to ever experience that amen only a select few amen I hope that I'm looking at them right now amen the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus amen praise the Lord God praise the Lord Jesus amen I appreciate the Lord appreciate heavenly father that he's appreciate that he's brought us through through another year my encouragement to you Saints amen is just to keep pressing on amen amen if if you've already slacked off on your on your New Year's resolution get back into it amen but really don't make it a resolution just make it a make it a life amen they say that when you've done something about 30 days it just becomes a habit amen I I I I challenge you I'm I'm being serious if you don't read your Bible every day if you don't listen to the word the message at least something every day get into the habit of doing it at least at least just for a little bit every day and I guarantee you that that will become a habit but just start it right the problem is is we have problems starting it we we love thinking of the idea oh I can't wait yes I can't wait the idea is good but when you have to put it into action that's when it becomes an issue amen amen amen the idea
