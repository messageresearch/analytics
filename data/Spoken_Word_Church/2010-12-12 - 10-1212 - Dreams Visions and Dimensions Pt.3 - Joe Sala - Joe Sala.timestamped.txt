[0:30] here just help me what I have to do is
[0:33] say this morning I ask in Jesus name
[0:39] amen uh Second
[0:42] Corinthians
[0:44] 12 starting the first first
[0:52] verse chapter second Corinthians 12
[0:58] 1
[1:04] he said is not expedient for me thess to
[1:07] Glory I will come to visions and
[1:10] Revelations of the Lord I knew a man in
[1:13] Christ above 14 years ago whether in the
[1:16] body I cannot tell or whether out of the
[1:19] body I cannot tell God knows such in one
[1:24] and one cut up to the third heaven and I
[1:28] knew such a man whether in body or L of
[1:30] the body I cannot tell God know it how
[1:33] that he was cut up into the into
[1:35] paradise and heard unspeakable Words
[1:39] which is not lawful for a man to utter
[1:42] of such and one will I Glory yet on
[1:45] myself I will not Glory but in M
[1:51] infirmities the kind of Lord is the Lord
[1:53] is kind of putting me in all kinds of
[1:55] different ways so I really don't know
[1:57] I'm probably going to be jumping back
[1:58] and forth here and
[2:01] uh when when when I passed this paper
[2:03] about the
[2:06] dimensions I saw a place where brother
[2:08] said there's
[2:10] uh there's
[2:12] uh after after set all the dimensions he
[2:15] said there was uh three going
[2:19] down yeah below below this the spirit he
[2:23] said below this there's three going down
[2:26] and three going up and uh I want to
[2:28] thank Brother Joseph for the quote that
[2:30] I've been looking
[2:33] for
[2:35] said God perfect in his church he says
[2:39] look he said the first thing when you
[2:43] here when you're going out of this line
[2:44] now get this straight here's where
[2:47] Mortals live a whole conation is
[2:50] Blackness and darkness and there is
[2:53] light little lights place now and then
[2:56] this Christians Born Again of light ye
[2:59] are your light that is set in a hill a
[3:02] candle that is set in a room and gives
[3:03] light to all the room that's what a
[3:06] Christian is among Darkness you're
[3:08] supposed to shine where it's
[3:10] dark now notice the wicked and the
[3:14] believer is influenced from beneath
[3:17] there is a trinity of hell like there's
[3:19] a trinity of Heaven that's why he
[3:21] couldn't understand because he was Paul
[3:23] that's caught in the third
[3:25] heav they're influenced by evil Powers
[3:28] now the first thing when you start
[3:31] down you find there a RM here that's got
[3:34] the unsaving it that's right that's
[3:36] where Jesus went and preached to the
[3:37] souls that were in prison they repented
[3:40] not in the Longs suffering the days of
[3:42] no the next is demons and the next is
[3:46] Hell
[3:48] itself the world is influenced by these
[3:50] demon powers through this Trinity and
[3:53] the Christians are influenced by a
[3:54] spirit too the Holy
[3:57] Spirit now the firstly the holy Holy
[3:59] Spirit above for Christians the next the
[4:03] layer is angels and the next Heaven is
[4:07] in God Holy Spirit angels and God the
[4:10] Holy Spirit come pass Angels come down
[4:14] to redeem
[4:15] sinners now what that woman done she
[4:18] only broke into the rim of them dead men
[4:21] a sinner does doesn't die I mean cease
[4:24] to exist when he goes out of this life
[4:27] he goes into a place of chains of
[4:29] Darkness
[4:30] and when the Christian dies now after
[4:32] the death of Jesus he did go into
[4:35] Paradise but when Jesus died he took
[4:38] away paradise and he goes in the
[4:40] presence of of
[4:42] God now notice like Jesus if you could
[4:45] get it this way look at here when Jesus
[4:48] died looked at him when he come people
[4:51] were captured they they were they were
[4:52] in doubts they were all SED up they
[4:55] didn't know what to do Satan had a Reign
[4:58] Over them and when Jesus come because
[5:01] the blood of bulls and Golds would take
[5:04] away sin Jesus come to give his own life
[5:07] that his own blood would take away his
[5:09] sins let's get a little picture here a
[5:12] minute I can see when Jesus when he come
[5:15] onto the Earth my what a person he was
[5:18] he was born according to the will of God
[5:21] he was for ONN by God and he came in the
[5:24] time of God and the will of God to do
[5:26] the will of God and the Hebrews 42 he
[5:29] said
[5:30] say yes no Jehovah Witness of friend i'
[5:34] like to ask you about that see
[5:37] if hell is a place like I say I don't
[5:40] know why God is kind kind of going
[5:43] towards hell so I'm going all over the
[5:45] place
[5:49] so Hades chill whatever you wish to call
[5:52] it if that seizes at the grave then why
[5:55] did he say I not leave my soul in Hell
[5:58] neither will I ser for the Holy One to
[6:00] seek corruption how about that see here
[6:04] his body was in the grave and his soul
[6:05] was in Hell preaching alive what about
[6:09] that he was in his theophany again his
[6:11] soul was down there with those people
[6:13] that were in theophany also and was
[6:16] witnesses to them they repented not in
[6:19] the long suffering he in other words he
[6:22] knocked at the door and when the door
[6:24] swung open and all those Souls that
[6:27] repented said I'm the seed of the woman
[6:30] I'm the one that en here over in
[6:33] Paradise another place don't never lose
[6:37] them three
[6:39] places now the place of the
[6:41] wicked the place of the righteous and
[6:44] held
[6:45] sh just like a trinity of Heaven like
[6:48] Father Son and Holy Ghost like the
[6:51] Trinity of the Beast the false prophet
[6:53] the Beast and the mark of the beast and
[6:56] all that remember it's all in Trinity
[6:59] trity makes one perfect one is perfect
[7:03] you're perfect one in three soul body
[7:06] and spirit water blood and nerves see
[7:09] whatever you was you have to take three
[7:12] to to make a perfect one take a three
[7:15] corner piece of glass and put the sun on
[7:17] it and you got a perfect rainbow see
[7:20] everything you have to have three to
[7:24] make it
[7:28] perfect
[7:29] this is the same message and con on the
[7:31] bottom says oh there's people in
[7:33] eternity tonight out in Hell screaming
[7:36] if you we could walk and pull open the
[7:38] gate like this and let you look down
[7:40] there I'll never have to make much of an
[7:43] altar call they would be screaming and
[7:45] climbing over one another for the
[7:48] opportunity but they have passed Beyond
[7:50] the Veil and Beyond
[7:52] Mercy it's too far they can never be
[7:56] redeemed they're gone forever they will
[7:58] never never never be redeemed they had
[8:01] the same opportunity that you have you
[8:03] wouldn't want to take their place
[8:05] tonight would you so why not take the
[8:07] place at the
[8:09] right right hand of
[8:23] Christ This is a little little off the I
[8:27] heard some people talking on the radio
[8:28] but uh Angels you
[8:31] know and
[8:35] uh they were talking about the fourth
[8:38] dimension and he was kind of right he
[8:39] said uh television is in the in the
[8:43] fourth dimension but then he said every
[8:45] time you turn the channel it means
[8:47] you're another another dimension so that
[8:49] 1 2 3 four how many dimensions by
[8:51] brother saying there's fourth dimension
[8:54] he didn't say all those
[8:58] dimensions
[9:00] and then this this is this is really I
[9:02] mean the people on the world have it
[9:03] right but they're I think they're a
[9:05] million miles
[9:07] off
[9:09] right they were talking about angel he
[9:11] said the the word sarapin comes from the
[9:13] word
[9:15] Serpent and he said
[9:17] the there the serin skin is kind of like
[9:21] a the way the snake It's kind of you
[9:26] know
[9:28] anyway
[9:31] he said and and he also said that
[9:34] Brother D was talking about this uh last
[9:35] week about the flying
[9:37] saucers he said the Angels live in the
[9:40] center of the universe and they take
[9:42] some kind of spaceship to get back over
[9:44] there he said even Jesus when he was
[9:45] send into heaven he used some kind of
[9:47] spaceship but then he talks about
[9:51] Elijah uh 2 Kings 2 verse he says that
[9:56] Elijah was carried on a you want to look
[9:59] it up yeah
[10:01] yeah which kind of makes you think a
[10:03] little bit you know but but yet like I
[10:05] said there're still a mile million miles
[10:07] off did they say anything about
[10:12] Enoch second second king chapter
[10:17] 2 2 to
[10:28] 11
[10:40] it said it came to pass they still went
[10:42] on and T that behold there appeared a
[10:44] Char of fire and Horses of fire and
[10:47] parted them both s Elijah went up by
[10:51] World R into
[10:54] heaven
[10:55] so like I
[10:57] said they got had a clue but I mean
[11:00] that's still like a million miles
[11:02] off a
[11:25] clue what is a vision brother said when
[11:28] Jesus raised Lazar from the grave it was
[11:30] far more of a miracle than what the
[11:33] woman was that touched that touched His
[11:36] Garment and was healed of the blood
[11:38] issue you admit that he never said one
[11:41] word about getting weak and virtue going
[11:43] out of him because God was using his
[11:45] gift there is those kind of vision that
[11:48] is a type of vision but when people use
[11:51] the gift to God what makes me weak at
[11:53] the platform he says you yourself that's
[11:57] what's is doing it you your yourself or
[11:59] doing the work uh operating it that's
[12:01] the reason is pulling through it's
[12:04] either you using God's gift or God using
[12:07] his
[12:23] gift in the uncertain sound brother say
[12:26] and when This Woman's Soul catches up
[12:28] with her and she said my God I'm lost
[12:30] and they think oh it's Delirious they
[12:32] shoot a hypo in the needle into her and
[12:35] she begins to numb off she can't speak
[12:38] no more she's trying she's rolling she's
[12:41] in agony and the doctor said give her
[12:45] the other one deaden her until the dead
[12:47] Angel sweeps her spirit from her but
[12:50] that hypon needle might deaden the flesh
[12:53] it might deaden the mind but it can't
[12:55] deaden that soul that knows is seen
[12:58] before God
[12:59] it hunt her through ceaseless ages and
[13:02] through eternity that Soul was still
[13:05] hunt and hunt and Hunt as the ages roll
[13:08] on now some Pastor will come up to the
[13:11] woman and say well our dear beloved
[13:13] sister she was such a loyal member in
[13:15] our church she came every sabath day she
[13:19] helped the poor she helped the needy she
[13:21] done all these things today she's in
[13:23] glory but if the truth was only known as
[13:26] out in a hunting place place called hell
[13:30] that soul that separated from her on the
[13:32] earth she listened to an uncertain sound
[13:35] and she went off into eternity without
[13:38] knowing god without knowing Christ as
[13:41] the new birth she believed it in her
[13:44] heart she believed it in her mind she
[13:46] thought she was right but she was wrong
[13:48] it's your soul what it does oh God have
[13:51] mercy yeah every time we go to funerals
[13:53] I feel bad because you know you don't
[13:57] know the people that passed away whether
[14:00] they know God or they don't you know
[14:02] would say oh yeah well everybody say oh
[14:04] yeah he's going to be in heaven you know
[14:05] he it was a good person or
[14:26] something the faith of Abraham brother
[14:28] said and I can see when that obedient
[14:31] son when he died he went over there and
[14:33] knocked on the gates of of the souls
[14:35] that were in prison that repented not
[14:36] the long suffering days of Noah all
[14:39] Abraham then was waiting for that
[14:41] promise and when he knocked on the door
[14:44] and all those wretched maybe at one time
[14:47] beautiful people back in the HS of hell
[14:49] he screamed and said I he Hallelujah I'm
[14:53] he that was prophesied by Enoch that
[14:56] should come and I done it I fulfilled F
[14:58] every promise that was made of me and
[15:01] I'm God's
[15:02] sacrifice Don across there he went to
[15:05] the gates of hell when he went to hell
[15:08] devil said ah said here you are I
[15:11] thought I H you when I killed Abel I
[15:14] Almost sure I had you when I killed John
[15:16] the Baptist and all these others but
[15:19] said now I got you you're here I got you
[15:23] I can see him reach over and get the
[15:25] Devil by the neck and said Satan you've
[15:27] been a buff for a long time H Allelujah
[15:29] but I'm the Virgin born Son of God the
[15:32] sin question is over my blood is still
[15:35] waiting calvary's cross Y and the father
[15:38] has accepted it you got no right to hunt
[15:41] and fool people anymore so give me them
[15:44] keys of death in hell I'm taking over
[15:46] down there slapped him over to one side
[15:49] and slammed the door in his face started
[15:52] back up there was another group sitting
[15:54] over there yonder waiting of that
[15:57] righteousness in Paradise
[16:10] I can say I don't know why God's going
[16:12] this way
[16:19] now that Trump giv an uncertain sound
[16:21] brother said and as soon as Satan got
[16:23] around eeve he began to reason with her
[16:26] now surely surely God won't do that the
[16:29] people say to their there's not no such
[16:31] thing as as hell a lot of a lot of them
[16:35] tell them that they say oh surely God
[16:37] wouldn't hurt would burn his children
[16:40] certainly he doesn't burn his children
[16:42] but the devil will his whose child are
[16:45] you that's the next thing hell was
[16:47] created for the devil and his children
[16:50] not God's children not one of them is
[16:53] going there that's right it depends on
[16:56] Whose child you are
[17:03] said from that time on said you pass by
[17:06] that church and you hear the people
[17:07] singing gospel song you really want to
[17:09] go in but oh my you light up another
[17:12] cigarette and shake your head what are
[17:14] you trying to do you're fighing your way
[17:16] into right through every
[17:19] barricade he said same thing he said God
[17:22] doesn't send you to hell you send
[17:24] yourself to hell right break every
[17:27] barricade run every stop like trying to
[17:29] make sure make yourself go to hell and
[17:33] then say that God's good I won send you
[17:35] to hell you're sending yourself to H to
[17:39] Hell God sends nobody to hell it was
[17:42] created for the devil and his angels not
[17:43] for you but you fight your way right
[17:46] into it men and women do people say you
[17:50] make too much noise this is the quietest
[17:53] place you will ever live in if you go to
[17:56] heaven even angels are singing day and
[17:58] night night holy holy holy unto the Lord
[18:01] if you go to hell it's weeping and
[18:03] wailing and nashing your teeth this is
[18:05] the quietest place you'll ever
[18:26] be the message part said when man sinned
[18:29] in the garden of Eve he crossed a great
[18:31] Chasm separating himself from the
[18:33] Eternal one man at that time was eternal
[18:37] with God he had no sickness sorrow or
[18:39] death man was not made to die hell was
[18:42] not made for man hell was created for
[18:45] the devil and his angels not for mankind
[18:48] because they were created on Earth to be
[18:50] Sons and Daughters of God but when God
[18:53] with man but when man sin and stepped
[18:56] across the boundary line between right
[18:59] and wrong he separated himself from God
[19:02] leaving himself no way back he was
[19:04] totally lost he could not come back
[19:07] because he had sinned but God rich in
[19:10] Mercy accepted a substitute because he
[19:13] had said the day you eat thereof the day
[19:16] you die God's justice and his Holiness
[19:19] requires dead because it's his word and
[19:22] he must keep his word in order to be
[19:27] God
[19:39] the message why he had to be Shepherd
[19:40] but said sin came in a moment by a
[19:43] transgression of God's law by breaking
[19:46] one word tonight my brethren your soul
[19:48] is over in Hell on a chain and that
[19:51] chain is not some Theological Seminary
[19:54] teaching that chain is not some
[19:56] denomination or some Creed that you're
[19:58] living by that chain is God's word Jesus
[20:01] gave the
[20:03] human race his word to live by and he
[20:07] only broke one little link of it any
[20:09] chain is no stronger than his weakest
[20:11] link when you take the word out that was
[20:14] the first of the book Jesus came in the
[20:17] middle of the book and said man shall
[20:19] not live by bread alone but by every
[20:21] word that proceeded out of the mouth of
[20:24] God that's the middle of the book The
[20:27] Last of the book he said whosoever shall
[20:29] take one word Miss Mist translate one
[20:32] word take one word out of here I will
[20:35] take his name part from The Book of Life
[20:38] you're passing over hell hanging on the
[20:40] word of God don't you let
[20:42] somebody squeeze something into you that
[20:45] that's not thus say the
[20:50] Lorden yes he was talking about angels I
[20:53] I think I have an angel too me driving a
[20:55] big old tractor trailer in Atlanta so
[20:57] and I don't have no serpent sitting
[20:58] right next to me you know one time I was
[21:01] coming on
[21:02] 285 I was getting 85 north and it was
[21:05] kind of wet and slickery so I got on
[21:07] there and boom the St trailer a jack
[21:09] knife so I I HD my brakes and I was
[21:11] going the same way he was going but the
[21:14] little words said let your foot off the
[21:17] break and as soon as I did I
[21:19] straightened up and I just
[21:21] went so we all have Angels like the
[21:25] children of God angels brother Dale and
[21:28] brother way listening to a tap
[21:31] yesterday from 1962
[21:33] on evangelism and uh brother brandom
[21:37] said that when you're born you're born
[21:40] you have a guardian angel right there
[21:42] when you're
[21:44] born and I don't think I don't think
[21:46] they have a little spaceship to go
[21:48] whever they have to go no I don't
[21:50] think believe they I I I think like I
[21:55] don't know said I'm not going to say you
[21:56] quot but he said we can
[21:58] uh travel like a thought right right
[22:01] right don't quote me because I don't
[22:03] have the quote I like to have
[22:14] Pro an exposition of the seven Church
[22:17] ages said we all know that the second
[22:19] death is the Lake of Fire and and dead
[22:22] and hell were cast into the lake of far
[22:25] this is second de of course that means
[22:27] all those who were there were cast in
[22:30] the Lake of Fire well then there might
[22:33] be those who say that eternal life
[22:36] signifies their welfare the children of
[22:38] God it is their welfare and enjoyment
[22:41] that is a state on the other hand The
[22:43] Sinner go to his punishment so that we
[22:46] can reduce the second death to a matter
[22:48] of punishment and place eternal life
[22:51] means heaven and eternal punishment
[22:54] means hell you would be surprised at the
[22:56] man who have been exalted as theologians
[23:00] that believe that but do you know what
[23:02] that does it makes eternal life a matter
[23:05] of
[23:07] geography instead of a person eternal
[23:10] life is God the Lord Jesus Christ how
[23:13] anyone could believe such a thing that
[23:15] eternal life is a matter of place is
[23:18] more than I know it makes me stagger to
[23:20] think of it I don't let anyone say that
[23:23] I don't believe in the Lake of Fire and
[23:25] in punishment I do I don't know how how
[23:28] long it will last but it will eventually
[23:30] be removed it says that those Sinners
[23:35] mention will have their part in the Lake
[23:36] of Fire but the true interpretation of
[23:39] the word is not part but it is time see
[23:43] there you have it so the Wicked the
[23:45] wicked shall be cast into hell Hades or
[23:47] the grave and H into leg of fire
[23:50] separated from God what a terrible thing
[23:52] that will
[23:56] be
[24:11] the Mage what does here like the old
[24:15] color woman said down in the sou she had
[24:17] an she had an accident a car hit her and
[24:20] it hurt her pretty bad and the lawyer
