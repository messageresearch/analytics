when to read from Ephesians both chapter verses 1 through 16 I was thinking yesterday some earlier things didn't go too good was doing some work heavy somebody got to my friend's trap mashing them

what we desire from you so that you Lord lead each one of us by your eyesight not by ours but let it be from the inward man that we can look outward and Lord see and understand because we'll look different when we do we love you and we think you just have your way remember all of those that are not here today different ones visiting different churches and just bless each one let your love be made manifest we love you and we thank you just have your way in Jesus name we've been on this for quite a while the Lord willing to kidding while ago the Lord willing Aaron will be ministering Foresters coming Wednesday and we may have to put him a shirt on one side he's gonna have a tie told him we'd hold him and put that on him but you know because his arm and all messed up but we'll fix him up some way he may be preaching in a short sleeve shirt but it'll it'll be all right then you know that shouldn't hinder his voice as long as it don't get to twisting his arm okay cuz that'll that'll take care of it okay John 1 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was a lot of men and the light shyness in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not let's go to Genesis because we can we'll try to complete this part not the series but the part that we end of trying to talk about being back tyre and what it was and whatever thing is Genesis 1:26 and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all of the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them you may be seated the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word now trying as I said to carry that thought home because what have we been talking about we've been talking about before the foundation of the world and what was going on and what was taking place and and all like that come on the end brother did you see come on their seats over our visitors they're with us they're not visitors they've been here before over there it's good to have you brother alright but we've been trying for quite a while now brother Branham speaks a lot about especially in the later part of this ministry about the fact of who we were what we were what was happening before the world because we could read the Bible and we could comprehend some things but we just couldn't follow it and we would read how that job would say where were you when the morning stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for joy we know that that was happening you know back before time began alright and then we would read in the scripture you know how that all names were written in the book of the life with a lamb that was slain before the foundation of the world all right so that's what we've been dealing with now for quite a while is back before the foundation of the world before anything begin to come into being of humanity or life or or anything that there was something going on the said joke says that they were the morning stars were shouting the sons of God morning stars were singing the sons of God were shouting for joy and we know that the stars are the angels and see then we know the Bible says that the angels are ministering spirits made to be to helpers to were the heirs of the kingdom alright so then they would be back down at that point and they would be understanding things and they would be rejoicing and this is not a Jehovah Witness doctrine or a to soul in the message parts or or whatever it's the truth that before the foundation of this world go ahead in his mind and he saw all the things they would ever transpire upon the earth if not what kind of a God do you have see you don't limit your God because if you just put it well he don't know this he don't know that then who are you really you don't realize but that's the devil in you trying to get you the worse of him because you're running your own ideas and opinions well that just don't work too good now you said yeah but I believe the Lord will see the Lord is not going to be contrary to his word now there's no way to for him to be that way all right see then we believe that we were not human beings back there the Mormon doctrine pre-existence was that we were souls they called it and then made us people before the world and they had the idea that we would want to come to earth and serve our Father and things you know and as they would do that they have people back there well we don't believe in something like that now I don't believe in pre existence of those things I believe in pre existence of eternal God right but not pre existence of people as any form of identities that we would be there you know of people running around or whatever it is so I we've been talking about that the Bible said that we were chosen in him before the foundation of the world all right see then the only one back there with him he was self existing he was the word Elohim which means self existing and he existed alone but he existed along with his thoughts his attributes all right and if you're a child of God today you're an attribute of Almighty God which means you're a child of God I've tried to drive that hard to us if you are a child of God then the eternal life you now have always was eternal but there was a time we didn't have it Jesus Christ had it all in him and that's where we were chosen in him all right then he would have to come to earth to give his life to release that part of him that could come into you and I'd make us then eternal all right but we don't believe in sin what I always was eternal well I've got where the Prophet said that well praise God I got where the Bible said he's done good no not one quote - you know you know Jesus don't don't run off with it listen to us say it and think about it if you have eternal life today if you don't have eternal you're not born again you're not a child of God me that's where people don't understand when Jesus was sowing the seed back there in the when he was preaching he was sowing the seed of the kingdom which were the children of God all right but those children had to come into human flesh and then had to receive eternal life to make that into a full manifestation to her that we would be right it's not that we come into the world with eternal life if we did I asked this one simple question I always have you think you come into world with eternal life then why did Jesus have to die what's the purpose of Jesus Christ so you're denying the Scriptures you're getting out of it or the Bible would say you're born in sin shapen in iniquity I know it's two or three Scripture is putting into the thought but you're born in sin shape it in iniquity and the spouse from your mother's womb a liar that don't look like too good of eternal talk doesn't and we don't want to get into those thoughts of mankind that's their business but we do want to talk about us talk about you and me before the foundation of the world we wasn't back there as some form of people so that's out of the way but we were back down in God's mind and I've told you to be in the mind of God it's a wonderful thing but remember at the same time he thought of Jesus he thought of Judas Judas was in his mind everybody in the world was in his mind all right now if that be true then I don't want to just be in his mind so I've conned the phrase apart I don't want to be in his mind I want to be a part of his mind Paul didn't say well I want to be a part of his mind and maybe Paul said it's Christ in you the hope of glory see then to believe in eternal life but to believe it correctly as a mute it's a marvelous thing wonderful Oh situation to me because mankind is always wondered about us where we come from what are we what is this what is that and they've come up with all kind of ideas well see we believe that God sent a prophet to straighten out mankind but mankind ain't gonna listen but it was still sinned they will be judged by what has been taught in this life days and we as a five fold ministry is to take that message and deliver it down to the laity because that's our job in our position and that's all I'm trying to do all right so do you follow me then that we read in the beginning was the word the Word was with God and the Word was God oh look at our with with with takes two or three of them but didn't go and read it and he said in God they said in the word we don't believe in know two or three gods we believe in one true and living God okay then the seeing it you'll have to bring it down as we will the Lord willing maybe next Sunday as to get into the creation and see that Jesus Christ according to the scripture John one closer one Hebrews one James three nine that Jesus Christ created all the time the father didn't create unless you believe it correctly you believe that Jesus was the father made manifest in another form right you believe it Dunaway then you tie it all together all right but getting down to a point to try to understand so we brought these statements out like the profit off of God reaching his mercy he said there was some part of you back there well that's pre-existence not if you think about what was back there if he was self-existing right then the only way you could be a part of it would be a part of him on the way you could ever think about being anything back there would be a part of God not to try to think that we're little people's are we were this or what war-weary back there were we floating around where we spirits were with he said no you were nothing see it's not he said on who's this melchester he said not your being here not of this now he said well we don't believe you don't but I remind you that ever doctrine relates back and will lead you to the flesh that's enough listen not our being here but the part of God if you have eternal life the eternal life you have as a part of God right the truth if you have eternal out the parts you have it's a part of God all right that was before the foundation of the world because he had attributes he never gained attributes coming into the world he displayed attributes he never become a savior he always was a savior there was nothing lost to be saved that doesn't do away with the fact that he was a savior that was what brought it out into the open or brought it forth was the things that was within him no desire to being a healer a savior a redeemer a father son Holy Spirit anything you want to bring was a part of God before the world and he just brought it into this play he said how do you know because he's here right he made his self manifest Jesus Christ come to be the fullness of the Godhead bodily and then he would sow the seed of the kingdom of the children of God and then it would wait till the day of Pentecost where the Holy Ghost to give life to the seed and so is the same with you and I when we receive the new birth it gives life to the seed that you've received cuz remember a seed without moisture there's no good when they dug into the some of those tools and the egypt's and the things like that they found grain in there that had been our four thousand years it didn't have any moisture so it wouldn't live they took it out and put the moisture to it what happened the life was in the grain but it had to have the moisture see all right so then I do not believe the statements that a lot of people are doing in the message today or saying I always was eternal well that's your business alright now in doing that see I believe that the part of God that you are is that new birth all right everybody clear on that I don't want no misunderstandings because it's easy to misunderstand the wording see the eternal life you have now the Prophet said if you have eternal life you always was eternal now what's the point well I just see it right dart said I always was eternal no you're not reading the rest of the message if you have eternal life the you you're not realizing you're making eternal sinners out of it and I thought we're supposed to be against that I thought was supposed to be the believing that we had to be borned again it wasn't something we come up with as I said in the other day then we come up with an idea or our concept that God just give us a little knowledge of who we are no they wouldn't two months giving a little knowledge when he died on the cross who released his life that that life could come back in you and me to give us eternal life see there's no eternal life outside of Jesus Christ without side the new birth is no eternal life even those at the white throne that will be given eternal life will never be part of the body of Christ because that's just an impartation to it you don't realize what it means to be a child of God like I severing the other day see Jesus said I chose you you didn't choose me remember in John but Paul turns around in Ephesians and said that we were chosen in him I asked you a simple question did you choose your children no you just got married and they come right you didn't choose them I've heard people say you know I don't know how though surely cut I'm afraid they might not be a true seat of God well now that says very carnal and very unacceptable to God in His ways why can't we believe and I quote brother around him he said if you don't have enough faith for your children he said I doubt you having enough faith for your self so if you can't believe your children and believe forum then you're not believing for yourself and you're not letting Christ being you remember they said the scripture says their pouted and if these we were chosen in him before the foundation board he didn't pick and choose he didn't just choose his children out of look into the world so I'll take that and I'll take it and I'll take I don't think missing it no he just had children I like to write my own self notes and read them sometime you know God never chose you to be a part of him are you listening he never chose you to be a part of him if we are his children we are him right not just being a part of him they say well you know he chose me I'll agree with you huh but just remember everybody that was ever saved or ever will be saved God knew it before the foundation of the world right okay so he knew the foolish virgins so you can say the food is virgins always was eternal same category puts you him alright now you say I come with it in me what did the foolish virgin come with it in them goes they'll eventually receive eternal life you agree you agree that they're gonna get eternal life somewhere Quattro and be a lot of people giving eternal life at the white throne did they come into the world with it in them no he didn't either we came into the world with one little thing a representation from predestination a representation from predestination alright remember then what comes first for knowledge or predestination according to the Bible those who he for oh and if they knew that I said four no because it's emphatically stating it those who before no he did predestinate so where were you going with it whatever you think about before the world remember you got to back up into his foreknowledge which means you're going to back up into his mind before the world and that's all I've tried to get us to say but yet the Prophet will make statements they sound like this that or the other but remember we used to read Matthew 28:19 and we read acts 2:38 and we said that was a contradiction till we found out the only way you can baptize anybody in the name of the Father and of the Son and the Holy Ghost because there's no name there the only way you can do that is in the name know Jesus said in the night the name of the Lord Jesus Christ now you got it correct there's not a contradiction the prophet or say you always was eternal then you know say you begin eternal out right here at the altar I sound like a contradiction doesn't it but it's not it's explaining the truth right here's where you get it you get eternal life by accepting Jesus Christ okay now to get to the point see then it's not our being it's the part of God that you're dealing with so in I've emphasized it over and over if you're chosen in him it's not the facts of whether I've chosen that's not the point see we want to make it all this way we say well I chose him the prophet of God said what that you say you accepted Jesus Christ as your Savior was has he accepted you you know that a lot of people are still on the basis I ask God to save me he's gotta save me but what if he didn't choose what if he didn't accept you what if he didn't accept your prayer what if your prior was a young a prior of demanding him to do something instead of asking him to do it there's a lot of difference in it right oh we would I can scriptures are where it says commands you me the Bible says that where are you gonna go out and command God to do something help yourself no you're dumb stupid but help yourself you're not gonna do that you're gonna ask him to keep his word and then by him knowing his word is true he'll come on the scene and fulfill his word that's not you demanding him that's you asking him to fulfill his word and he does it let's see well I can quote the scripture says yeah yeah when I said one scripture says none good no not one the other one said be therefore perfect or the contradictory no but our mind sure is alright now listen so we have to be a part of him to talk about anything before the world morado we seven that problem to think of anything about you and me whatsoever in any relationship of anything is to start off by thinking if we're a part of him then you see like I said where Jesus standing there to Mary and he said I go to my father and your father he said I go to my god and your God because we're the children of God the only thing that could be before the foundation of the world was God and his offspring his children well that makes people back garden oh I don't because you're not getting it says you're chosen in him so it's not whether or not he chose me it's where he so Jesus Christ and we know he did that now that solves a problem right we know he accepted him but when did he accept him simple point I keep trying to pull your mind by when did he accept Jesus Christ well they come on the cross not do that that's not according to the Bible according to the Bible he accepted what was happening at Calvary anything before the world ever begun right so now all we got to do is find out if we can be a part of him that's the whole key to salvation it's not philosophies and ideas it's whether we are the children of God or not and how did we become a child of God thank sent in Jesus Christ as our Savior then it proves whether you was before the foundation world not Bakker's people in him I spent years trying to preach to you want Elohim means what self-existing there was a time that the probably said God dwelt alone nothing with him before anything ever happened that he dwelt alone he was self existent within he just slides and a thought and he said he dwelt alone with his attributes so we he didn't he didn't become father he wasn't the father back there my wouldn't if he had that attribute in it he had the attribute as a savior why wasn't he a savior there was just nothing to make it manifest it was not needed at the time you realized then that if we believe that we are the children of God that part of God that lives within us was before the foundation of the world then you got it in the right order see part of him part of his being all right are you sitting on that partner that we were in him or will never be in him so we think he had children as they come forward no no his children were a part of him before the world ever begun or else they never will pay why don't we get that settled but it's like I said to you over and over this is where I I differ with biggest fortunes of people and I differ with it because I know I do it myself but you see we don't read the Bible for what it says we don't read this message for what it says we read it for what we want it to say we want to interpret what is saying well according to my Bible it says the Bible is of no private interpretation now that doesn't even give a prophet a right to interpret the interpretations gotta come from God himself through the profit right okay but he's only on that vessel it's not his ideas it's what God say it try to go back to it when Jesus said repeat every one of you you know or said for you to be baptized of the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit Catholics say we do that to the letter physically speaking they do the letter but now you mean to tell me that Jesus would say and mean that you're supposed to be baptized father son Holy Ghost and then Peter 10 days I think it is from the time those statements was made was a very short time and they asked Peter said well unless we do to be safe now what was your done remember there was 11 of them there that was darned by the time he's happily Matthias was already put in he probably a confident one great a lot but they was tenant Lee standing there and Peter gets up and says repent everyone and be baptized the name of Jesus Christ well now why didn't John say hold it you didn't say what Jesus said Jesus said father son Holy Ghost why didn't want her to disciples correct the other one because they knew they what he was a saying was exactly right the only way you can baptize in the name of the Father and the Son and all ago need to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that's simple plain but it's right right they all right see then we believe that that's why we baptize out of what and you come next Sunday you hear me say this because I believe the prophets message and I like the way he said things so you are known I'll show you where he said it he said the way i baptize is to say to fulfill the great commission of Jesus in Matthew to baptize in the name of the Father and of the Son and the Holy Spirit I now baptize thee my brother and sister in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ he said the devil can't argue with you because you got both scriptures lined up together his reason he can't argue with you you take one by itself the other side of argue one by several other side of argue if you don't believe that's right I'll give you a book unless I take go to work the Godhead explained where they were questioning brother Branham about baptism you can see if he don't tell them people he said you baptized into the name of the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost and he said into your right he said the only way you can do that is to baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ he had him closed off because they thought he was bragging on them but they were doing it right and then he goes on what it was see the truth to correct the error right all right so then I've been talking about it especially this makes three services what were we before the foundation of the world not the background a little bit for the company where it doesn't lose them cuz it you know yes I thought using it and wonder what you saying so you know but make the point and get it dark all right what were we before the foundation of the world we were not people I've emphasized and we were not a little identities floating around little bumps little spots or anything you want to make it we was in Jesus Christ if we have eternal life but of those that do not have eternal I was not in Jesus Christ you use every book but they sell those people hadn't received eternal love you that ain't got nothin to do with it the book of the life of the lamb slain was written before the foundation of the world and if your name was not written in that book it never will be in that book they are books that you have to deal with your name can be in the book and be removed but it can't be in the book of the life of the Lamb that was slain before the foundation of the world the eternal part never be removed I said that's it and there's no such thing as we talked about a new name was written in heaven you've heard that you know so-and-so got saved a new name was written in heaven there's no such thing he was either done for the world it would never be done they will be one day those who are given eternal life at the white throne and you can transfer the name if you want to go to the message and there's reunion and you can go to a point of transferring at that time but remember you're not talking about born-again Christians because you don't transfer is either die or it ain't time that solves the problem all right so now what were we back tired we were a part of him when I was asking him this morning a simple point to be Almighty God it takes what you know to be Almighty God what is he father son Holy Spirit raah and when he came on earth he proved what he was to come with Father Son and Holy Spirit he came down as what God Himself tabernacled in a human body that was created and so the soul and the spirit of Almighty God came into a human bomb and very late in the in the cradle the Prophet would call him Jehovah crime Jehovah with no teeth said your god a baby laying in a cradle I don't make no difference he was adamant there was things he couldn't do that he had to wait until aids came you know what I mean is he got older the Bible said he grew in grace and knowledge huh he finally come to a place one day he could speak to the fire season a thing you remember and correct him but he couldn't be your Savior at that moment he was still too young then he entered his ministry he was not your Savior at that time he was your teacher see he grew in one Eon what was might manifest he grew into it Laura now so then thinking about him now what part were we before the world we'll be part of his body no well we part of this spirit raava said we wouldn't spirit Specter I'm still in the Godhead whether y'all believe it or not trying to preach one true Living God been added fifty years and still ain't got it done yet what were we before the world you've got to deal with the fact of God be in the spirit right but do you realize until this message came to express things and the truth no matter who it is they never had it lined up right that's why you can go through the Old Testament you don't find the body of God in the Old Testament right you know what I mean you wouldn't in the Old Testament in a physical form a body you had to wait and the body was provided the prophets had to build the body rah come on oh you're up but you can follow the Spirit of God through the Old Testament right cuz you can see the Spirit of God as it comes upon the people you can see the anointing that would come upon Moses or the prophets and times you can see that spirit as it anoint them will remember that spirit anointed by them Balaam has prophecies in this word Balaam God took baylin's word and put it in the Bible that's why you can find the Spirit of God throughout the Old Testament but can you find the soul of God there oh can you find the soul of God in the Old Testament can you find that the Athenee of God in the Old Testament yeah because he wasn't appeared to milk to Abraham not a spirit but not a human flesh body because he could just step in and out you let the body be learned let it be flesh that's fine you know no problem but you understand what I'm talking about that body of Melchizedek could not die for your sins because he would not kinfolks right you understand what I'm saying the Old Testament you can't follow a line unless you know what you weigh you're going well what about in the Old Testament when he appeared to Moses at the burning bush now I'm not the one that wrote all the books Oh remember that now but Moses said one day he said Lord he said I've talked to you I've seen you do great things I seen you destroy Egypt I've seen you all of these things I'll miss it the burning bush I said Lord I'd like to see you he says you can't do that now ice garden for speaking back to it he said you can't do that Nile he said no man can see my face and live why because it was not time but what did he do I love where he put him he didn't say Moses go over and stand behind the old oak tree I've been there it's wonderful place he didn't say go over here and to pool she'll only been there singing what he do he said Moses he said go stand in the cliff to the rock what rock is he standing in the one he spoke but the water came from was the rock which is Christ he said Moses go stand in that rock that was not a physical rock he went over okay down Lord go ahead it wasn't a physical rock that fathered the children of Israel he would've dug out Rock he kept moving moving water running out up no the water went where they went you're still running for the gusher all right listen so he said go stand in the cleft of the rock and he said I'll go by and said when you do turn around look at me well said you can't see my face and live he saw a man didn't he now I'm quoting brother Branham he said he saw theophany now I'll quote him again and saying what he said that was the very back of the Lord Jesus Christ of the theophany that he was Abraham he appeared Abraham what about when he appeared to the Hebrew children that was in the fiery furnace and wouldn't know corporal physical body was it that was the theophany okay a prophet saying what he said a body kind of like our bodies looking but he said not like it will be in the glorified state but he said it's a body that God dwelt in okay now I ask you a question what part were we a part of before the world what part of God were we a part of he was so real and so personal until when his body laid in her to the earthly body went to hell to preach to the spirits in prison I'm quoting brother Brennan you didn't call it just the Alpha knee he said his soul went to hell now I got a direct quote in here I'll be glad for you to read if I don't get time to read the run said in spirit he never went to hell you ever heard it like that he said in spirit he never went to hell he said he went in his soul which was this theophany now there is where the people don't understand it page 80 of the Hebrew book I've quoted that since 1969 two people indicated as he still don't want to believe we wrote around and said the difference in a man in an animal he said God put her soul in you he said that's all he put in you that's theophany you realized then what he would be saying when he comes on over in the questions and answers and asked him that he said Eve was still in theophany and Adam was put in flesh he said Eve was still in theophany he said she was one in Adam in theophany so now whatever you think about what this is and what you're going to and whatever you do Adam and Eve had to same theophany I know that's all it's a problem there was one in theophany brother Brennan said to show it right then to prove it he said then she was not taken physically from any other dirt and made a part of him she was taken from Adam oh we want to make her a by-product we want to make her a piece of hamburger meat butwe're porterhouse steak you know what men we're great we're you better go on and look up the word by-product if you ever looked it up don't raise your hand if you ever looked up the word by-product I've asked you for it 40 years to look it up if you ever looked it up the word by-product means a same value or greater value we want to make it a by-product if something's wrong he never made her wrong putting her in flesh brought the ability to see in night was remember Adam sinned too so in his body he could have sinned he did so how did Jesus go to hell his body didn't know I'll be glad to read where the Prophet City spirit didn't go he said cause the Spirit came to die a spirit came down come on read your Bible when Jesus Christ died what happened the body went to the grave where does the Bible say the spirit went back to God who gave it and then your prophet is one that put it that the soul is what went to hell called we read where it says spirits in prison and we want to use that experience to try to make his spirit go he wasn't his spirit that went to hell the word spirit and soul did it and read it taking concordance and look up the word definition of the word spirit and see if it's it does not in your Strong's Concordance does not distinguish between your spirit that is five senses the spirit of mankind and the spirit of Jesus Christ it does not tell you any difference in it it doesn't tell you one is this and one is that it tells you the same definition we know Jesus is spirit what it was it was the spirit of Almighty God see if his spirited went to hell then he would've been dying so what is it if we were in him where we were at oh yeah if we were in him if we were in the end before the world you had never heard brother Branham make this statement he says he then died by if we're part of him he said I suffered with him he said I hey I was on the earth and went through the thing he said and I died in him and said I went to hell in him and said I rogues in him now what part of God could fulfill all of that there's one if everybody believe run a random they wouldn't be so confused you say so theophany mind of the people who go I got it the often the up yonder and the right songs I'm not against it but they write songs I'm I not theophany is calling me I agree with that we'll remember there's a lot of difference in the new birth and God calling you to something worthy calling you to if they ain't something pulling you so I ask you the question by thinking about that the often in the soul and and what we said about the Old Testament Saints can you see the very soul of God down there with him now murder random he said God didn't stay up in heaven he said he come down to dwell with man to fellowship with us just in spirit everybody can fellowship with him in spirit words that over where's that soul of God throughout that Old Testament now if he's Hebrews 13:8 he's got to be saying yesterday today and forever okay the soul of God was back there what is the soul prophets it is you you're a soul that's from you must be born again where were we act not just a part of a spirit up in heaven because that spirit can anoint anybody that are doing it by him and he's prophesied in the very person of Jesus Christ David Solomon not a born-again believer but the spirit could come upon them so great until they could speak in the first person right David senator Solomon ones who said they pierce my hands in my feet speaking as though he was Almighty God but can you find this old which we say but the soul is is your saying brother dealer so I didn't say it bred around it but you say you're saying it's a soul is the theophany look I got a feel from if you under I got Bible fart but you ain't reading your Bible would you mind reading where it says it said if which is a question if this earthly Tabernacle were dissolved we have one waiting watch now eternal in the heavens do you have the new birth today you claiming you I don't where his hands I've asked you to think you have the new birth do you have eternal life in your soul all right do you have eternal life up in heaven buried in you so that pulling you up there is you theophany in the positive your soul is your Theon listen your prophet explains it I didn't a sinner has a theophany but the Anthony means a body and that body of a sinner go somewhere not just a physical body we bury it the spirit goes back to God who gave it but his soul goes to hell that's why you don't listen to the prophet he said he went beyond the curtain of time he said the angel of the Lord and I got it laying right here if you don't mean it he said the angel of the Lord told him this is sold under the altar when he went beyond the curtain of time he said now listen he's returned I'll be glad it's laying on my dad he's referring to sinners and he said stop sin he said and I saw God in the same type of body went beyond the curtain time were our who was in hell come on who is in hell the souls of the people that sinned so you don't see it in your spirit you don't sit in your body those are displays waves you send from your soul the soul that sinneth it shall die it doesn't say the spirit that sinneth see you don't understand that we try to make it to her but not the often these up you under within what do you have inside of you if you have any turn a lot why can't you say the eternal life you receive according to the profit you receive it as a baby right faith as a baby what's pulling you if you're born again today the pool is not down here to pull this from up here you're drawing you up we're dry well why don't you see it's your soul when you're born again is eternal and that starts the process of you being drawn upward into a positive of God's mind why can't you see that about yourself see then that makes it easy to understand they tell you this ain't something new for me so I don't have to worry about it for over nearly 50 years I've been preaching this I got tapes from 2002 upward to show you because when God showed it to me I saw a soul of a man named Jesus as it come down through the Old Testament he's very nice her you tell me it wasn't the nature of a man who was it when a prophet stood before a king what kept God from killing David the words of the Prophet weird words our prophet come from David said bring the man here I'll kill him myself what the prophets say he said David you won't ha Jesus we call that's right for you who was praying for him father that soul of God through the Old Testament as you see him making itself manifest with the children of Israel then he blindsided his own eyes to him in the way they were doing and still took him into the Promised Land maybe that's a wrong way of saying it but it's the truth in it they got to the promised land why not just because of an anointing of the Spirit it was a very nature and being in person of Almighty God if you can't do that then Hebrews 13:8 don't mean a thing to you he's the same yesterday today and forever whatever you can find here you'd be able to find it dark well I never thought about the soul of God do you know what word was it app if you think the man didn't know what he told me David said my soul thirsts just after the old guard he cried out in his soul and like I said what went down to a grave called Hades hell Gahanna show whatever the world you the soul of the individual was put in a place but you know there was another place called Paradise they told Old Testament Saints not in body was in the gray not in spirit he went back to God who gave it within their soul they were there and what I love is what the it would emphasize you ever heard him say that he said saver come here they come here saver remember he's gonna knocked it to go where you know they opened the door into him and I believe it's right when he said saver come here he said this is the one we fed the cave to he recognized him come he was standing there in history of the body he was standing there real enough that they could see him you ever thought about the soul of God why would Jesus get on the cross and say my soul is troubled brother branham's when he said it he said the anointing left Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane where he could die as a man the flesh is what died the soul just stepped out of the body and went straight down to hell first and preached to those that were disobedient the long-suffering the days of Noah and on his way back up he stops at paradise right and you know what a lot of those Old Testament Saints raised what did they raise up him their physical body wasn't in there their spirit wasn't done what the prophets say about it when you die he said it in time comes he said your soul is released it'll come to the spirit in spirit to the body and he said you stand here I would run around them emphasize it why would the angel of the Lord tell brother Branham two times that those souls under the altar getting scripture he saw those people he held him a sinner has a place to go when he dies right a Christian has a place to go when he dies where is it sold under the older not crying how long how long now you got in the wrong way with your scripture it's how long how long and stop till sealed you I said how long how long they'll be in job blood we don't to use it because we're afraid of that your prophet used it names of the Lord referred to the Prophet this is sold under the altar he didn't say these his spirits under the altar he said this is sold under the whole tree so what part do you want to be of of God can folks to the body okay fine that would be wonderful he give us a blood transfusion spirit they can anoint this to anybody what about the soul of God what about it okay then they read these Feist I want to get off of this but I can't and the message God who is rich in mercy he said you always were the sons of God and when God had you in his thinking at the beginning you have to be some part of you your life that's in you now that had to be with God before though now what was it in God being part of him part of his own life now watch him who is this Melchizedek if you have eternal life you always was not your being here with the shape and form of the infant of God what's the shaitaan' form of the infinite god what what do you have any trouble with a theophany back now you know we've read this over and over questions and answers on Genesis he said some part of you some part when God created me William Branham I was before the foundation of the world he made my being my spirit I wasn't conscious many things for and I know it and I was dire he said I don't believe you're hitting it look there was some part of me Armand and use the Armand Neville and part of you rest of you there was back there were before the world how by being a part of God being the children of God Easter seal we are part of him each individual in here that possesses the this eternal I was before the foundation of the world in God's thinking well he's just in this thinking that's part of him here's where we got through the other day and we read this one but let's go number 5 which is the message Christ revealed in his own word he said now the same is if you are a son of God and I am a son of God or a daughter of God we were in God at the beginning and when Jesus became the fullness of the word then we were in him jerm form gern form means you got the germ but it's not totally alive we wasn't in him in flesh he said that's the type host of the soul now we're gonna start and give me just a minute that's 20 tails we'll hold on look at the next one number seven the Good Shepherd of the Sheep you believe that in him never dwelt just part of God but all of God was in him I mean was in his son Christ Jesus he was the fullness of the Godhead bodily all of God was poured into Christ all that Christ was there was was in Christ and Christ and the poured into out on the church and he said we keep refusing it refusing what refusing to accept what God's doing what is the next one the message taking is really not to your own understanding God is not complete without you know what about that God is not complete without you all right you ain't answer to get brother there okay we'll answer it go to number nine spoken word as your regional seat if I were in the foreknowledge of God then you are becoming a part of God and the only way you can be a son of God or a daughter of God you had to be a part of God and God isn't complete without you he's had to go through the next week that's number nine and go to number 10 yeah I mean number nine excuse me back then I get my numbers I've called it I haven't ours number nine it's taken spoken word broken sister all right that if I had it if I don't know before there was world when we were sold now you want to answer in the profit what were we before the world he just answered when we were sold a part of God there we are but we were with him before the foundation of the world because there's only one form of eternal life and that's God and we're part of him not so much of that you would know when the thing I could think or had a be a huh we're in stocks you said well that's just in his dollars okay so a part of God go to number 10 what worry before the world number 10 demonology physical realm but your souls were made up before the foundation of the world when God created man in his own image when did your soul come into being as a part of God he's telling you which your souls were made up before the foundation of the world when God created man in his own image now how many people did he create we've done established even Adam was one one theophany right the many souls that he create before the world one take it Olivia sleep he's the one that said it I did your songs we made up for the finest world when God created man in his on the image spirit of man not a man in his own image but man in his own image then he made them male and female before he ever had a man of the dust of the earth which we had a change in you know could do for them and that made man in His image and when God turned around was made an image of man to redeem him right number 11 well mascoutah selling out and when God made man in His image he was a spirit man and then there was no man that tells us all then he created man out of the dust so now we know what happened Adam was created first spirit man that Aaron says theophany so Eve was a part of him in theophany she had her own being at herself and was herself but the one theophany was what God created in Genesis going down to number 11 the faith of Abraham I wrote it up and you begin with a soul before the world was ever formed when God created man in his own image so the man of Genesis 1:26 and 27 there not to be created on the sixth day he was created before any day he ever come Genesis 1:26 and 27 if one theophany one soul and that's the soul of Almighty God he calls off short to even blaspheme his name were God put into Adam eternal life you know got him right here where he were Eve was dire she was still in theophany Adam was down here in flesh then when he done it he put him in put her into Adam then he separated her out of Adam what were you before the were a part of God part of one part of his soul okay let's go to number 13 trying to skip a few 13 which is the message questions and answers in genesis - there was no man to till the soil and God made man out of the dust of the earth not in His image but in the image of the animal life he was virtually creating the image of God and he put the spirit of him in this animal in this animal man here and he become a living soul now that's the difference between a man and an animal the animal don't build automobiles etc he's a dumb brute all the time with a man in his flesh he's like a dumb brute but he's got a soul of God in him that makes him immortal now don't hook that to everybody be any mortal read the rest of the story cuz the center is not immortal immortal means eternal read the rest of it you see and he can invent look what he can do he's almost only equal with God because he's the son of God now stop start your sentence even in his fall in the state he's wonderful not saying the sinner is immortal read it I want to get this one where you read it okay go ahead and over 15 and I want to do this in anyway where you get dirt on the Queen of Sheba reefs in 1960 brother Branham says the animal died and could not come back and he be in the spirit with the human beings he couldn't come back because it was an animal life without a soul what's it but Jesus but when Jesus died it was a soul of God now watch him you said well he didn't die he acted the part of death I got it in here okay that's the unveiling of God he had to go through an active part of that where Satan wouldn't know what's going on his soul didn't die he just went to hell and come back up he played the part of death or Satan don't know the story that's good he could not die what's he God failed in Jesus to do the work of redemption to crawl God could not die as a spirit he's eternal but he had to put on a mask and act the part of death that was his release in that soul out of that body and then boy the soul went to hell and he so was its theophany we turned back onto their Pentecost as the Son of God okay come on musicians I get too much I'm sorry I pushed in and I leave you dangling while they're coming one time what part of you was before the world it's not your body it's not see spirit he said what was my soul back there your soul was only a part of God there's only one eternal life there's only one eternal theophany a sinner brother branham I'll give him to you I know two times these hawks of a sinner having that theophany uh-huh but that the often he's not eternal that's the body that he goes to but a Christian his his soul is its theophany page 80 of the Hebrew book he couldn't put that into an animal he put it into a human being when he made God in His own image made him a soul that's why David could cry out my soul thirst after the old God that's why you cried out in your soul we worked on my life's not the question was asked literally enjoyed the questions and answers life not we had a wonderful time the question was brought out of what what about you when you was just out in the world and born you don't remember a conscience of a human being science says is a moral obligation I mean in a world defining a conscience is a moral obligation to do good why cause you were created by God that's good he never made you wrong he made you right you went wrong but a conscience you remember when your kids come on girls boys ladies women be sensible without being brother Dale being so bad but you remember when you girls and boys had never been out with a boy or a girl and done anything wrong remember the little temptations it would come to the to try to get you to go do that and you wouldn't do it but then one day you slipped and done it and after then it was easy for you to do it why you seared your conscience but it won't stop dealing with you that's what I said every word listen the other night what brother Ron was talking about that little girl that he told her he said God is calling you tonight she went outside in you're here sometime later she's seen him and said you know that day you told me that she's yours right she'd be cold all of my life said something has guided me and tried to bring me to God I said I wouldn't do it and said from the night you said dad said my conscience got seared and said I could see my mama died now in life about it but she said God dealt with her up to that time that he spoke you don't remember God dealing with you to try to keep you from doing wrong and you just overrode it what was the first lie oh the lie detector test you put it on somebody and they tell the first lied but after a while to keep lying it don't do too much that's what I'm talking about that's what your prophet said so don't you remember something different about you that you wanted to serve God come on you don't like it for people that can make statements but I saw God when I was 11 years old I don't back up from that time I desired to find that God but I'll let the world take me into the garbage can as you know what he never stopped I rode by their toes listening I rode by their here while here you did last year something and to go over and Wade was bush hogging or something and I rode by that church not slow down that's it Lord I said I remember when I saw you I marked the place beside the pulpit I said I remember when I saw you I said but I walked out of that church we might have went back a few times but not much after then I said I walked out from your presence I'm sorry now you leave this to what you want he said when you walked out I left - I don't care these that I left - what if I was the one who come after I've tried to tell you spiritual matters you don't listen wasn't a Baptist Church I thought of God I've told you this story I went up to unlock the church it was I just always done that unlocked the church every Sunday evening and all we had was a little push button you don't have a key we knew how to omit of you rich didn't push it and it was locked everything was locked up I walk in and I'm turning the lights on I'll go down in the basement you know unlock everything there's a man walking right didn't scare me I said hottie how you doing he said I was just walking by thought I might come in look around I said help yourself I said we get to it a little bit unlock he's everything ready that's where our church night he said I just I can't do it I gotta go on I finished out walk up to the front he was walking down the road now you can thank this to us young to where was the first church we went to Peggy's back there my brother Mike said engage for that man had left that church wouldn't go towards commerce he was going up the road I've seen him before we said God is real church he's not the thoughts of your mind forget all the doubts of your mind that and read the Prophet when he says you always was eternal don't get outside it well I'd always eternal try don't need to be saved now boy you've got a corner line go ahead we're just saying one verse a mite hasn't need I'm sorry a little bit anybody ever need the older though let's see that there that's what we are we all to thank in blood and praise him there's a missile nation more today Oh ain't God good ain't God good now ain't God good more Jesus to give us their hands upon a time taser is healed and we believe it that's
