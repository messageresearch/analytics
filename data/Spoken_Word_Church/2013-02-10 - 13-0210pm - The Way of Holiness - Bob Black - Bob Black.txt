bless you Saints let's turn to Isaiah 35: 8 I I appreci I appreciate so much the love that youve shown to me I had one of the brothers tell me he'd been fasting for me since Friday amen Lord means so much to me amen yes sir Isaiah 35:8 let's bow our heads and go to the Lord Lord God I remember one time when after John the Baptist died Lord you tried to get away and find a secret spot by yourself but the multitudes followed you and you're disciples didn't have anything to feed the multitude that's right so they came to you and said that's Lord we don't have anything to feed the people yes Lord you said you introduced them to the to the food and you began to break the bread and the fishes the Loaves and the fishes for the people and you gave it into your disciples hands to pass it out Lord I pray that you will do the same today for me Lord multiply what I have Lord Jesus and give it something to the people that they can feed Lord and I know that nobody's come here today to be seen or to to see me but we've come to see you and I pray that you'll Open the Eyes of our heart Lord Jesus because in your word you said that only the pure in heart will see you Lord help us Lord that you'll show us the way to be pure in the heart God granted I pray that you'll bless the reading of your word Bless the people today Lord Jesus remember Brother Don and the ones that are sick they couldn't be here Lord God granted I pray that you will be with us this afternoon in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Isaiah 35:8 says and in the highways shall be there and the way and it shall be called the way of Holiness the unclean shall not pass over it but it shall be for those the wayfaring men the fools shall not he therein amen a way of Holiness that's so simple that the fool shall not air there in exactly and I was thinking before I come up here how did I get up here today amen last Sunday I I on the way home I was talking to my wife about uh the the different things along life Journey that that God you know he he gives you little Clues along long lives way that he's going to might be using you later on down the road one time when I was praying God spoke to me in a certain way and then uh then one day brother Wade out there uh uh outside when I was uh uh helping people get out of their cars and things doing my dickon duties and brother Wade said you going to teach Sunday school next uh Sunday and you know God uh has a wave for each one of us mhm um but there's a way of Holiness too that I want to talk about and only the holy can walk in this way before you can walk in this way you've got to pay a visit to the Fountain that's amen everything all right right than all right I I thought I was too low or something no you're fine okay all right good so Isaiah 358 and uh I was uh thinking about how in nature everything the way that the the earth and the planets orbit the Sun and everything is just ordained of God the Earth is the third planet in the solar system everything moves around in a certain way it has a path that it follows and uh and the the whole solar system moves through the Milky Way and through the whole uh Universe in a certain way that's ordained by God so that the planets don't run into each other and everything just works in a perfect passion and uh then the animals and the the Ducks and the uh they all have their way that they follow and everything moves in a a way and a pattern that God has ordained but uh everything keeps to the way that God has ordained it except for man right and uh because God gave us sorry that's all right just they were tell me we're not to put the whale and Jonah and all right all right wonderful so uh everything has an order and a way that God has ordained except for um except for man and God put us on pre moral agency and before each one of us has presented two ways God's way or our way and the the path that we take in life depends on what way we choose right and I was watching uh uh I don't know if you ever heard of Kirk Cameron and Ray Comfort they do this thing where they go out and witness and a while back they had a a a debate with atheists and um this woman rose up in the audience and she said why is cancer why is there such things in life why do bad things happen to seemingly good people and they were they said well let's go back to the Garden of Eden and talk about what happened in the Garden of Eden but and and she cut them off and she said no I don't want to hear that and that's our problem a lot of times is we want to take our way instead of God's way won't listen to the revealed word and um now the problem you could say the problem started in the Garden of Eden but really the problem started before that the problem started up in heaven when Lucifer the preacher up in heaven began to bring his own ways and said he tried to set him up set himself up above the word of God and said I have a better way and he grew he was such a good preacher and presented in such a wonderful way that he drew a portion of the angels to him that's something to think about he he knew the word so well that he could draw the angels to him and then then he brought the fight down to earth in us and I I was I think about that a lot of times at work how we'll bring in consultants and present you new software something to buy and they present it in a way with with no Foundation they just present a good PowerPoint slide or something but there's no substance and it always boggles me how people uh will will look at these consultants and say well um you got something really good there but hold on a second Let's uh back to the Bible let's compare it with the word and see how it matches up that's right because I might have I I know many times down through my journey I've read God's word and looked in the mirror of his word and reflected back on me and I can see a problem that in my life I've it's not uh not treating people right or different things you know that that doesn't Echo back right so you got to it's got to compare back with God's word that's right so God has put us on a free moral agency to choose either his way or our way right amen and then he Lucifer brought it on down the battle down into the Garden of Eden and he found another preacher in the Garden of Eden the Beast who came to Eve and showed her what she thought was a better way something contrary to God to God's way right and uh she took that Doctrine and brought it into her little home and uh Adam wasn't really being watchful right and uh she brought that Doctrine into their home and you think about it a lot of times uh maybe we bring a little things that are not according to God's word into our home we'll say let's let our children eat of the uh eat of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil so that later on in life they won't desire it like Les's let's let them play around with smoking little toy cigarettes and things so that later on they won't desire it but the desire those things it's purged by the pillar of fire inside of you the consuming fire the Holy Ghost is not purged by taking of the tree of life and then later on hoping that you won't have a desire keep your house clean keep it San that's the way truth brother and then uh I I just wanted to take a little summary down through the ages of how how the we have just a huge history of a a solid foundation of saints before us that have stood on God's word instead of their own ideas and the first one I want to look at is Enoch who was a seventh from Adam and it said that he walked with God and he was not for God took you because he he had this testimony that he pleased God and he he had a revelation from God Jude wrote about how he saw God coming with 10,000s of saints and and uh he had he had a revelation of this way to walk with God and so he built a monument to this way in Egypt and in this Monument it had been sealed for so many thousands of years and people could not find a way to get into it it was sealed that you couldn't get a razor blade in between any of the ston and that's how much we are seal in Christ that the devil can't find a way to get inside they had to blow open an opening to get inside to find a way with with a dynamite and then when they got inside they found there was three huge stones that sealed away justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost once you are Justified Sanctified baptized with the Holy Ghost then you can start on the way inside those three stones was seven steps 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 up into the king's chamber because you got to be you can't start on this way you can't walk this way of Holiness until you met the fountain and then the next one Enoch um think about in this it's age when Cain went out into the land of no and he began to produce this Satan's evened this economy where everything was working according to Satan's Grand Design which seemed like a good thing and out of all of that that economy God brought these men who were who would stand true to God's word he brought Enoch and then he brought Noah who uh Paul wrote being warn of God of things not seen as yet moved with fear prepared in AR to the saving of his house and I remember in uh and straight As the gate brother B talked about how uh how the he he just marveled at how the word could be presented from behind behind the pool and then people would go and go out in their lives and and you know uh not pump gas on Sunday but on Monday they go back into their filth of things but Noah he he was moved with fear to get his house in order to get everything ready he began working on an arc to save his family and you know uh it was contrary to what everybody else thought would be the right way to do it and but he uh he put aside his own reasonings his own imaginations his own uh looking by his sight and he looked at the things that could not be seen right and he buil an ark while everybody else thought called him crazy right and then he uh he went into the ark and uh God sealed Noah in the ark cuz we can't seal ourselves right God seal sealed him in the ark and waited for him on the other side with a pyramid in the sky a rainbow in the sky saying I'll I'll uh I'll never uh do this again and so with Noah the Earth was justified by water and all of the all of that iniquity all of that stuff that came and set up all of that filth in the world was washed away just like our sins are washed away by justification that's right and then Abraham who uh after Noah they they uh men began to prosper in the earth and they built the Tower of baby and set up tried to uh if if they they were thinking in their heart if another flood were to come then uh we'll Escape by our own by our own workers and they uh they built that Tower of Babel and then God caused their their uh Speech to be confused dispersed into the different parts of the world and Abraham was coming down from the Fertile Crescent with his with his family and God spoke to him and said uh don't go this way go that way that's how repentance is you turn around you get to turn around you can't keep going on and when he was called he was called out and he began to look for a city in a Strange Land not knowing where it went and you remember brother R talked about how you can't see if you can't see this the path in front of you just go hold that light out in front of you the light of God's word and take one step at a time and that's how you do it you know en walked with God for 365 years the uh brother Wade was talking at Sunday school this morning about the T toris in the hair the slow and steady wins the race it's slow and steady and consistent that's right that's that's what wins a race a life live and uh Abraham God uh through through Abraham's life he showed the this way that Isaiah was talking about justification sanctification in Genesis 12 and he was called out and God uh pointed him in a different direction said go this way down into Canaan he justified him and then in Genesis 15 he Sanctified and when by he offered a sacrifice to God and God showed him that vision of horror great Darkness the smoking furnace the burning lamp and Sanctified him and then in Genesis 17 he said let me read it Genesis 17 walk before me yes right that's right there it is I am the almighty God walk before me and be thou perfectly the for the baptism of the Holy Ghost walk before me because you can't walk this holy way until you've been filled with the Holy Ghost you'll stumble and fall you'll have ups and downs you'll uh trip and and we we still stumble and have troubles and things but the the uh oh we'll get into it and uh so through Abraham's life he showed the path that we take righten and the uh God revealed himself self to Abraham because and when those those three men went to down into met Abraham and then the two rose up right and went down into Sodom and Abraham went with him to bringing them on the way and the Lord said shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do right and why was he going to reveal to Abraham the secrets why was he going to reveal it because he knew that he would keep the way of the Lord for I know him that he will man his children and his household after him and they shall keep the way of the Lord to do justice and judgment that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he said has spoken of him yep and Sarah you know it's it's written in the in the Old Testament you know uh she laughed in the 10 and so forth but in the New Testament Paul wrote of her she received strength to conceive seed because she judged him faithful who had promised she didn't have she didn't have any child but uh she brought forth Isaac the promised the promised son as though one from the dead that's right and then uh Hebrews 11:1 13:16 says now there here's the here's the key these all died in faith not having received the promises but having seen them AAR off and were persuaded of them and embraced them and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the Earth right for they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country and truly if they had been mindful of that country from which they came out they might have had opportunity to have returned but that's the key they weren't mindful of that place that they came out like the Lost wife that when she came out she turned back and was turned into salt she they weren't mindful of where they' come out so they had no they had no problem with leaving right they were uh once they hit that road they were gone and uh then Abraham offered Isaac brother brand said type justification believing in a resurrection and then we get on down to Jacob who gave up everything for the birth right right right he gave up everything for the birth right and then moved on to uh get the father's blessings and a lot of times down the road you'll see people stop at sanctification and say well I'm I'm living a Godly life I'm going to church I've got the father's blessings on me but later on down the road he met the angel of the Lord that touched him in his hip and cus him to walk different when you meet the angel of God it'll call you to walk am exctly and then Joseph Prof Joseph was you know he was his he he had a he God gave him visions and caus him to be different and his his brother because of that they hated him they thought he was trying to put himself up on a pedestal yeah right but all he was doing was just telling the word telling the truth one day you'll bow down to me my goodness you uh you trying to make something of yourself so they took him down into Egypt uh th threw him in a well so sold him off into Egypt and God delivered them by his hand now Joseph had to make a choice too when they poer was gone doing work and and Piper's wife was out and and and she she gave Joseph a choice to either take God's way or his way and Joseph ran from her right so fast that she was all she was left with was a little piece of garment in his hand in her hand right and uh my if we could run from the from our own ideas and our flesh and everything that quickly that we' have something there and then Moses when he was born he uh a pharaoh rose up that didn't know Moses and when he was born he was hid for 3 months by his parents now they saw something different in Moses they had a revelation from God and they when all around them the people were uh the the the Egyptian uh Army was killing these little babies they they knew they got a revelation that if they hung on to this little baby that they were going to lose him so they let him go that's if you lose your soul you'll save it by the gospel if you give it away you'll save it give it to God if you keep it if you keep your soul to yourself and try to polish it off with your own doctrin ideas things then you'll lose it sure as anything by faith Moses when he was come to years Paul said refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter so when he got old enough he was like I'm not I'm not uh I'm not standing with this I can't stand in my denomination anymore I'm going to have to go out and he went and of course he tried to take his own way about killing the Egyptian the next day they uh they said what uh are you going to do the same thing to us and ran off into the Wilderness where he met the pillar of fire and God put him on the right way and then he turned back to Egypt brought 10 plagues that combed the the the all the different gods of Egypt and showed Pharaoh that I this is that you're wrong and the Israelites showed them that you're right by the 10 plagues and the last plague was against against Pharaoh himself you call yourself God well let's let's see and the last plague was death to the firstborn and uh so the children of Israel before they crossed the Red Sea they had to be covered by the blood amen they went in to the little uh into the little homes and maybe one of the little children would look up and say Daddy are you sure this is the right way and I remember growing up I had a A Moment Like That where uh you know you you've heard about I heard about the message since since I was as as far back as I can remember every night growing up we were raised in a an atmosphere every night growing up we had devotionals every single night I don't remember ever when whether we were on vacation or anything we were always talking about the Lord and and and creating that atmosphere around it but one day I I remember going into my dad's study where he had a little a little thing on the wall with the pillar fire and the different uh uh pictures of of brother Brown and the things that had happened in his life and I looked at that Pillar of Fire and I thought you know this is this true you got to have a uh you you can't just say I I believe it you got to be anchored so much said he believ it but you got to know that you know amen and I I looked at that Pillar of Fire and I thought I know that this this couldn't have been fake that there is a God that's why I like to have the pillar of fire in my home because it's uh it's a uh a testimony that the message that we follow is true that this word that we believe is the true was sent by God and you can put your faith in that so they were covered by the blood and then they had the pillar of fire going before them and and then they cross the Red Sea said the pillar of fire Scar the Red Sea back now brother uh and uh Brother Anderson go ahead and put that picture of the the Red Sea Crossing up cuz I want to think think about what we're we're looking at Isaiah 35 away in the middle of the highway right now brother brand said you get too far to the right and you get all starchy and you think well I'm I'm saved because how how much I know and different things like that you get too much over to the other side you got get bogg down in fanaticism and get blown whichever way the wind blows you'll go to different do if you stay right in the middle of the way and keep your eye on Christ like Moses when when they were getting over to the other side he went up and stood on the Rock so they could keep their eye on him keep your eye on Christ and you will finish the journey amen right he he gave us a way of Holiness but before they could get on that way they had to go they had to believe that Moses was the deliverer right they had to believe it and then they had to be covered by the blood and then they had to be led by the pillar of Fire P fire experience and then as they journeyed through the Wilderness they came in many different many different along life Journey you have a little Milestones along the way think about how uh just looking at your life you uh you maybe you graduate from school and then you uh get you get married and you start raising your kids and and all these different Milestones I remember reading about John Wesley's father he he gathered his family around and he was as he was lying on his bed and he said I'm so thankful that I have this Blessed assurance that all of my family has been saved and we have a Blessed Assurance as life comes to a close maybe in our life and uh God has led us along so that even though things around us may look Bleak and dim we have a Blessed assurance that we're saved in him amen that's right amen and uh then as they journeyed along they got to the the uh Mar the bitter Waters and sometimes you maybe you came to a place where you you put all your hopes and Trust into a minister or something and they fell by the wayside and I know so many stories of people that have put their trust into a Ministry or or into somebody and then something happened bitter water and uh or or sickness and problems like that lady was asking why the things bad things happen to good people but they stopped in the bitter Waters there was plenty of water that was more than enough for them to drink but they couldn't it was bitter they couldn't drink it but they found out that the answer was right next to the water and they put the tree Moses put the tree into the water and it was made the water pure and then uh the children of Israel journeyed to the kades barnea where they were presented with that great choice that they turned down and now I just want to point this out all these different Journeys lot there was only three saved out of out of Sodom and gomorra Noah was only eight save and when they came to kardes barnia there was only two Joshua and Caleb and of course Moses just three that believe that they could go over and how it's so few that really truly can walk in this way I heard I was listening last night as straight as a gate and brother random said that he doubted if they would only be 12 out of this generation that's such a hard thing to imagine 12 but it makes me want to go try so much harder this pridee it's not something that's out of your reach cuz he said whosoever will the problem is that we don't want it not we me but so many don't want it and that's the problem with uh that we have to overcome is we'd rather take our way than God's way we all have that choice our way right or God's way right and uh so then the children of Israel they began as as they began to walk in lock stop step and harmony with God's word when they got to the to the Jordan River they were walking in such harmony with God's word till God spoke to Joshua and said tell them sanctify yourselves for I will do wonders and they Sanctified themselves for the for the Jordan River Crossing and they crossed over and Rahab was looking out and she saw by this time the pillar of fire had been veiled in the Tabernacle until the New Testament that was hidden inside those batter skins she couldn't see that but she knew these people were walking they were led by something that she had never seen before and as they crossed the Jordan River something uh was something was pricked in her heart and she said I I would like some of that those people that's how that's how it is when uh when someone sees the real gospel being live that preaches a greater sermon than anything any any Ministry could preach right it's uh far louder and uh so Rahab that she hid the two two spies and hung out the token outside of her window and her whole house was saved and then on down to the last one that I want to talk about before we get into some study is is Jesus and Jesus was born and a away that people couldn't couldn't understand why was he the the king of glory the uh Lord of Lord's came and was born in a little manger right and think about his adolescence and how he was as he grew up it was Elohim veiled in flesh veiled from their eyes the god of Glory was right there in their midst and they couldn't see it and you know I've heard it presented before that that maybe Jesus when he was younger would uh maybe act like a lot of other kids and might have you know stolen from the cookie jar and then lied to his mama I don't see it that way because if he lied to his mama he's yielding to the that five gates of the outer core he's yielding to his flesh to his flesh just like Eve did but the pillar of Fire was inside of him the same fire that L out ofp was in him from the day he was born to the day he died that's what I believe and uh so I want to look at his disciples one day they asked him this question so I want to look Brothers if you bring up John chapter 14 and I'm going to read from the DI amen cuz this way it took them out of Egypt yeah the the way of Holiness took them out of Egypt that's right but it also takes us in right to him in John 14 verse 1 says let let not your heart be troubled I'm reading from the emphatic diaglog so it's going to be yall read from there and I'll read from there let not your heart be troubled believe into God and believe into me yeah in my father's house are many dwellings but if not I would have told you because I'm going to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I am coming again and will receive you to myself so that where I am you also may be and where I am going you know the way GL thas says to him Lord we know not where thou art going how do we know the way yeah Jesus says to him I am the way and the truth in your life no one comes to the father except by me if you had known me you would have known my father and from this time you know him and have seen him so this way of Holiness takes us out of all our own ideas all our own senses and everything it takes us into him right takes us into his life and at the Garden of Gethsemane Jesus was presented with a choice too to take God's way or to take uh a different way and he said father let this cup pass for me but nevertheless not my will but thine be done and he went to the Cross where he was pierced in the side and by the Roman soldiers and out from his side came water and blood and then he tilted his head back and said it is finished and gave up The Ghost and out came spirit and there's the way back to him the way to the way of Holiness is to be justified Sanctified and F with the spirit and then you can walk in the way Romans Romans 8:29 and3 says now here's our uh here's our confidence when you take your first step onto the way yeah for whom he did Forno he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brothers that's right moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also Justified and whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we then say to these things if God before us who can be against us cuz if God forew that you would want it he's already glorified you all you have to do is stay in the way and put one foot in front of the other that's here you have met your journey but what's the goal what's the end of the journeys to see God and uh so I I wanted to present this way this this journey as a journey through the Tabernacle and uh I had this book by this man named Alfred edine that talks about the layout of the temple and how there's lots of gates at Solomon's Temple but the Levites only guarded five gates they guarded five gates on the outside and then five gates on the in the inner court and then one gate before the holy of holies so as you're as you're going taking this journey up the steps to the way you have to you have to go through each of these Gates the five gates on the outside the five gates in the middle and and then that one gate to the inner sense that governs your whole body exactly and our problem is that we get offended along the way we get our our uh we look at things with our natural eyes and we can't see the way that God does it and we uh that that's a problem is to look past like Abraham counted the things that he saw as though they were not amen and uh in Romans uh 9:32 he said wherefore for because they sought it not by faith but as it were by The Works of the law for they stumbled at that stumbling Stone as it is written behold I lay in Zion a stumbling stone and rock of a fence and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed and we stumble uh many times along this journey stumble at the way God does it at at the different things that we uh come across in this journey right now the the Jews stumbled JW Jesus had his parentage they said at at his birth at his place of birth they thought he was born in Galilee and he never corrected him he said now hold on let me explain this I was born I really was born in Bethlehem but they thought aren't isn't the Messiah supposed to come from Bethlehem Judea and uh he which he really did come from of course and then they were offended at his appearance he looked they were looking at those outer five gates they looked at him he's not a man that we said should desire and he looked he looked uh maybe not polished up and fancied up with a fancy suit on like Lucifer back there in heaven looked up and he and and he drew all the angel that portion of angels to him when Lucifer was doing his preaching but uh and then they were offended at his lack of Education what he did for a living and the company he kept he kept he kept company with the publicans and the Sinners and the poor and then along life way along the way they began to be more and more offended at his doctrines as he progressed from the first pool to the third pool right and they were offended at that he healed on the sabath sure right they couldn't understand I see a lot of times we we have our own ideas why are you heal on the Sabbath they had their own ideas but if they would would have stopped looking through the the veils of their flesh and the veil of their spirit and looked at God's word they would have seen that he was right in line they were offended because he collected Grain on the Sabbath and Jesus told him don't you know that David ate shoe bread and was found blameless don't you know that the priest profaned the Sabbath and are found blameless he was proven to him that he was opening up the scripture to them to prove that they didn't know what they were talking about instead of going back to God's word and basically on that they were basically on some on their imagination on things that they thought were true but they're not and then they were offended because Jesus and his disciples ate without washing their hands oh yeah and I I think how so many times we get offended at little uh you know we know uh you know people that won't go to a church that's 2 miles down the road because they have like a brick just to illustrate a brick between the church and the fellowship hall shame on you for having a fellowship hall that's connected by a brick to your church and the word might be coming forth from the pulpit but they won't go there we get offended at these little things and then John the Baptist disciples thank you brother you got some more sorry about that John the Baptist disciples were also offended they were offended because Jesus and his disciples didn't fast and Jesus told them how can you fast when when the word is right when the word is taken away you long to be closer to God and you want to get rid of those five senses so you you fast to to give way to the Holy Spirit right and they were offended because maybe they didn't live and as off steer life was their as their Master they were offended because they didn't really understand Jesus was talking about this Kingdom that uh we must was must first be in us before we would be in it in the natural they didn't understand and then uh just along they were and everyone was offended as they looked at John the Baptist lack of education and then today look how brother brandom didn't use proper words and his proper speech oh yeah right now you would he would say you know sometimes when the anointing would hit and he would say that do you believe that I am a prophet oh my just like when they looked at Joseph and said uh when Joseph told his brothers you the prophecy they looked at him you trying to make something of yourself but when really he was telling them the truth and you know they they got offended because of Elisha had a bald head and now they're getting offended because they don't understand when brother brandham was out west before the cloud appeared in the sky and they say that's not true they got offended at Noah three pools right they got offended when Jesus they everything was fine when he was Healing The Sick but then when he began to call out the secrets of their heart and say you got to be pure before the uping of the word can come you got to be get all that stuff out of your life before the word can be be revealed they begin to be offended and the same thing with brother Rand when he began to preach and open the word and then people began to be offended think about those prayer lines that that fool all the way to the back of the church but then when he began to call out the secrets of their hearts you committed adultery and things it started to thin out a little bit we maybe we don't want that now maybe we don't want to live a clean life a clean Godly Sanctified life but you got to live a San life before the word can come the third pool the opening of the word and maybe Joseph was offended about the blessing of Ephraim and manasse and uh think about uh pleas oh just going through the the five courts we look at our own memory and our own reason instead right of the word of God and then uh I want to let's look at Genesis 3 because uh we look at our own our own senses instead of instead of God's word and that that's not God's way right that's our way right and as as we read through Genesis chter 3 just take note of how it it was presented how the language that was used right sensory language now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made and he said unto the woman yeah God said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the Trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God that said ye shall not eat of it neither shall ye touch it lest you die and the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely die but God know than the day you eat thereof then your eyes shall be open and you shall be as God knowing good and evil and the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and it eat and gave also unto her husband with her and he did eat and the eyes of them both were open and they knew that they were naked and they seed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons so this the the the problem that Eve had was she was looking by her five senses instead of looking she was she was honoring her five senses instead of looking at God's word and let's Journey on in a little deeper next to the next five gates affection brother brand was I have a note about 1 Corinthians 13 about how Paul was talking about how if you give your body to be burned give all my goods to the poor all these different things but still you don't have love then you can have when the Holy Ghost comes into your life he changes your affections from the affection of this world to the affection of God you start Desiring different things your affection becomes changed and then imagination a memory memory is you memory will stumble you a lot of times you as you're taking that Journey along you'll think you look back to somebody that you knew that did such such a and you it hinders you you think well this minister or something wasn't living a Godly life so maybe it's not true what they're saying or you remember all the past things you did in your life and it stumbles you you think maybe I can't be saved but uh put aside all of those things and look at God's word he said whosoever will let him come and the the three p God's drawing us through these five gates to draw us to the world so that his word can be manifested to us let's see and then uh uh just uh finishing up over the next few minutes I want to tell this little story of how just jump back to the Garden of Eden how when Cain and Abel came out of the garden when they were standing looking God had set up an altar in the Eastward of Eden and uh surrounded it guarded it by cherubs MH to keep man from the way back see it right until it was covered by Blood right right and the altar is in man's heart there was a substitutionary altar waiting in the Garden of Eden for something for for the offering that Cain and Abel could bring and Cain you know he brought an offering of what he thought it was because Adam and Eve told Cain and Abel that it uh they they hid from it was a mystery they hid from they hid from their children what really happened in the garden of oh my and so Cain thought well I all I know is it was a fruit and they ate something so I'm a farmer I'm going to bring what all I know about it and and surely God will accept my Revelation by my five senses and my five spiritual senses my reason my conscience my affection I I love God he he had a natural that kind of affection you know he was a a a Believer as far as going to church and doing things right but Abel on the other hand had a revelation that God revealed him and brother R said he looked all the way down and saw that one day God was going to send God was going to come himself and lay his life so that we can come back and so Abel goes out and maybe one day he was out about and and just I I don't know how what the process that this Revelation came by maybe one day he was watching a little lamb be born and he saw the water and the blood and the spirit and he and he said I I see something in that but he by Revelation he took an offering he he took that Little Lamb's life and laid it down on the altar MH y That's and Cain looked at that and said My Five Senses don't agree with that and uh right right and uh you know thought thought that he was crazy yeah and uh but uh AEL AEL went through those those two stages you know first before you can be Sanctified you you must be covered by the blood justification to believe sanctification and then he he laid it on the Altar and he waited right now how is Abel going to how is God going to accept Abel's sacrifice it's the same way that he accepts our sacrifice right and uh exactly Cain brought his offering up there and when God accepted Abel's sacrifice he was all upset right he couldn't believe that he would accept right a sa a sacrifice that was brought by faith instead of a sacrifice brought by the senses amen right so let's look at how God accepts sacrifices in Romans 12 verse 1- 2 how he accepts your sacrifice and he said Abel laid himself on the offer of sacrifice not not literally but you know that's right he because he was identified with his sacrifice Romans 12 1 and 2 I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service amen and be not conformed to this world what be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God Amen right and then Matthew 3:11 I indeed baptize you with water under repentance but he that cometh after me is mightier than I whose shoes I am not worthy to Bear he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire amen and then we remember Elijah sacrifice first king 18:22 to39 then said Elijah unto the people I even I only remain a prophet of the Lord but baal's prophets are 450 Men Let Them therefore give us two Bullocks and let them choose one bullet for themselves and cut it in pieces and lay it on wood and put no fire under and I will dress the other bulock and lay it on wood and put no fire under and call ye on the name of your gods and I will call on the name of the Lord and the god that answer by fire let him be God amen amen and all the people answered and said it is well spoken we know what happened there and then Moses sacrificed in the wilderness the first time that Moses offered it and Leviticus 9:23 24 and Moses and Aaron went into the Tabernacle of the congregation MH and came out and blessed the people and the glory of the Lord appeared unto all the people and there came a fire out from before the Lord and consumed upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat which when all the people saw the shouted and fell on their faces right and then judge at 6:21 when Gideon's sacrifice was consumed right then the angel of the Lord put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand and touched the Flesh and the unleavened cakes and There Rose up fire out of the Rock and consumed the Flesh in in the unleavened cakes then the angel of the Lord departed out of his sight what about 2 Chronicles 7:1 where God consumed Solomon's sacrifice now when Solomon had made an end of praying the fire came down from heaven and consumed the burn offering of the sacrifices and the glory of the Lord fill the house God when he gives you the baptism of the Holy Ghost is with fire Holy Ghost and with fire to consume all of your all of your doubt and reasoning and objections to the word the quick to live a life and to Walk This Way that Isaiah was speaking about right amen and we take so the requirements in in uh that day on Calvary 19 19692 brother random said you don't have to be lost there is a Highway in a way and it's called the way of Holiness the unclean don't pass over it for he comes to the Fountain first then he enters the highway right right and then you can walk and I want to real quick as the I'm I'm finishing up so the mag magicians could go ahead and come and Ezekiel 37710 so I prophesied as I was commanded and as I prophesy there was a noise and behold a shaking and the bones came together bone is bone justification yes sir and when I beheld L the sun us and the flesh Came Upon him and the skin covered them and bl but there was no breath in them y sanctification yes sir amen then said he unto me prophesy under the wind prophesy son of man say to the wind thus sayith the Lord God come from the four wings of breath and breathe upon these slain that they may live so I prophesied as he commanded and and the breath came into them the baptism of the Holy Ghost and they live and stood upon their feet sir an exceeding great Army and then they could walk in this way yes sir amen am thank you enjoy [Applause] it's a way good job he's
