are ready to hear the word this afternoon amen so let's just sing this song I Feel the pool feel the pull key of f let's start with the with the chorus I feel the [Music] I hear the call and know his

people who can fill the pool there's so many today that know nothing about God we become a Godless Nation amen and yet in the midst of all this chaos and all this Darkness he promised to send his light to pull us out of this Darkness aren't you grateful for that and he didn't say Well when you're 50y old I'll call you or when you're 60 year old I'll deal with you but with don't have seven eight five yes he'll call you at any age amen amen and what we want to do is be willing to yield to that pool amen amen I remember many year ago as a a young boy I felt him when I was about seven or eight year old and gave my heart to the Lord and I my parents got cold on God and took us out of church and for years I was out of church and he got into the army and spent four years and come out of the army and I was in an old building down in Jonesburg Tennessee and I felt the pull of the Lord I I was there was about 2:00 in the afternoon and I was in this old building by myself I wasn't in church wasn't at a youth service just in this old building by myself and the presence of the Lord came into the room and I I knew it was him because I felt him when I was a boy and and the voice just spoke to my heart and right there I surrendered and gave my heart to the Lord Jesus and is the greatest thing I ever done there's nothing like serving the lord and you know he'll be just as real to you as your faith can declare him to be some people see him every time they come to service because their faith declares that he's here and others come and never see him because their faith but he'll be just as real that's right as your faith can declare him to be we gree you in the name of the Lord kind an honor to be with you this afternoon and we know it's vacation time a lot of people going but we're grateful that you're here and We Trust something just be said to help you and encourage you so if you have your Bibles turn with us to the Book of Exodus and I know you have some activities and so we won't don't want to keep you long at all and yet we don't want to rush to the Lord so but I I've got a little thought you say well this is a youth service but the Lord just put this on my heart coming down the road and I just want to be obedient to that and I trust it'll be a blessing to you because we're living in a time you know that we're in a Warfare amen but I want you young people to know that even though we're in a Warfare God has not left us empty-handed he has given us something to fight with in this hour that we're living in and that's what we want to look at this afternoon if the Lord will help us so we want to read from Exodus chapter 4 starting at verse 1 and two amen very familiar scriptures to us Exodus 41 and 2 the Bible says this and Moses answered and said but behold they will not believe me nor aren unto my voice for they will say the Lord hath not appeared unto thee and the Lord said unto him what is in thine hand and he said a rod yeah right Amen Let Us bow our heads you said brother Daryl that's not a lot of scripture but I think it's enough I want to speak to you this afternoon for just a few minutes on what is in thy hand amen Heavenly Father Lord we're so grateful to be able to call you father we thank you Lord for all that you've done for us and given us in this hour father we're so grateful that there's living in such a time and yet Lord there's young people who has a desire to serve you Lord and to know you and to draw closer to you father I pray today that your presence would come Among Us Lord that you would encourage us through your word that our faith could rise up and receive that which you've already given us Lord that we would leave here with the understanding that God you have given us a great weapon in this hour to fight our enemy with Lord and may we use it dear God with all that's with our hearts bless those who come today Lord those who was able not able to come may you be with those those on the prayer list dear God my my daughter Ally not feeling well today I pray God that you just touch her body Lord and sister Becky and others God that brother Dale there in the hospital different ones Lord may your spirit just move for them knowing dear God you have all things in control you are both healer and sustainer of our lives so we commit these things into your hands For Your Glory in Jesus name and the bride says amen amen God bless you you may be seated praise the Lord what is in thine hand you know no matter how mysterious it seems God always keeps his word now God don't keep his word 99 times out of 100 but 100 times out of a 100 God will keep his word if God says he's going to do something he will do it no matter how mysterious it seems to be he will keep that word even no matter how unreasonable it may seem to be to people yet God keeps his word if God makes a promise about anything God will keep that promise amen you know you and I we make a promise and sometimes we don't intend to but we'll make a promise to someone but we have to break that promise but not God if God said he'll do something he will do it amen he knows the future and he doesn't make a promise that he can't keep amen oh my we can say amen and go home today and say we've had a great time to have that understanding if God said he's going to do something for you he will do it and sometimes the way God does it seems so ridiculous to man and so ridiculous to education and it would seem so so strange that how he would go about to keep his promise but he always does it anyhow and the thing about it is God don't get in a hurry if God makes a promise well you know we live in an instant age everything's instant you know it wasn't too many years ago if you wrote someone a letter you'd wrote a letter and give it to a guy on a horse and he'd ride and give it to another guy on a horse and three months later somebody out west would get a letter and say hey John how are you and so then they would answering three months back and this way and that way and finally 6 months later you get an answer back and say I'm okay but now we're living in an hour of instant messages and that if we hit sin and it and and it it it gets canceled or it don't go through we get upset because it's instant pudding instant this instant that but it's not with God amen amen sometimes we have God does Miracles we know God does Miracles but other times God does healing but it's the same God keeping his promise amen and no matter how ridiculous it seems and no matter how long it takes God will keep that promise amen he told Noah it's going to rain 120 years later but it rained you know why God said so amen he told Abraham Abraham you and Sarah is going to have a baby 25 years later they had the baby you know why cuz God said so you know we're living in a time people can't wait 25 minutes but Abraham wait 25 years he told Isaiah said a virgin is going to conceive 800 years later Amen on a virgin conceived you know why cuz God said so he keeps his promise amen no matter how long it takes he'll do it anyhow amen oh praise the Lord that just stirs me up and God told Abraham that his seed would sojourn in a Strange Land but he said I will bring them out amen 400 years and as the promise begin to draw nigh the conditions in Egypt begin to grow worse and worse sound familiar it begin to grow worse and worse and and when AMR it was a guy by the name of amram and his wife named Yad and the conditions of the bitterness of the bondage begin he begin to come under the burden for deliverance and remember when God told Moses that the burn bush what did God tell Moses he said I have heard the Cry of my people so part of the Deliverance of God's people was when they begin to cry out for it amen well let me tell you I've been preaching now for 30 some years and I have never seen since Co I have never seen a time in all my Ministry where the people of God are crying out for the coming of the Lord Jesus and it makes me wonder are not we entering into the same condition when violence is in the land and all the things that are happening and the people begin to cry for deliverance and Hallelujah God said I have heard the Cry of my people and I am come down to deliver them and amram begin to come under that bondage and the prophet of God said that they would beat him in that day and his back would be bloody and bruised and and yed would be trying to put some medicine on it and he' say I've got to go pray she say h amram you're tired just rest tonight just just don't go up on the rooftop and pray he said but I've got to pray God promised Deliverance I've got to remind god of the promise that he gave me oh that's what we need today no Winds of Doubt could ever blow that out that's what we need as boys and girls today who have believe what God Said and stay with that word regardless of what anything regardless of the situation regardless of what's going on around them God made the promise and I'm going to stay with it till he delivers me amen if he don't answer tonight he'll answer tomorrow if not tomorrow it'll be next week if not next week it'll be next month but God will answer amen for he said in Jeremiah 33:3 call unto me sayith the Lord and I will answer thee Oh The Prophet said God wants his people to pray and when Israel got so taxed in such a condition that they couldn't go any further their time was fulfilled and their burden laid further than they what they thought they that they was able to Bear they begin to pray and when the people begin to pray then God be began to hear it was time for God's word to be fulfilled when not so tired and weary and amram Goes Up on the Rooftop to pray once again oh but he wouldn't give up amen that's right and he was tired and he thought I'm just going to close my eyes for a moment and he falls asleep and something awakens him and standing in the corner is an angel of the Lord hallelujah said amram I am the angel of God and I've been sent from heaven to tell you God heard your prayers and I've come to tell you he's going to send a deliverer and the most wonderful thing about it is that deliverer am is going to come right through your home amen this time next year you and your wife will have a child and that child shall be the deliverer I've heard the Cry of the children and I'm coming down and I want you to know that you're going to play a great part in this amam because you're faithful in prayer that's what we need today is young boys and girls who are faithful in prayer amen amen now we find Moses before the burning bush and God is telling him his purpose for being on the earth and what does Moses do just like a lot of us he began to make excuses Amen to why he can't go well I stutter I've got a speech impediment and I'm no good and they're not going to hear me and they won't believe me they they won't believe that you sent me and you know but God didn't want his excuse God don't need our excuse he just needs our obedience you said brother darl I'm not a very good this and I'm not very good at that God don't need your excuse he just needs your skin Hallelujah somebody that he can get through into somebody that he can shine his light through in this hour that we're living in Moses begin to make excuses but he didn't God didn't want his excuse he wanted his obedience and what could God do with us if we would oh my if we would just be obedient to his call rather than making excuses for why we can't do it right and finally God says what is in thine hand Moses what is in your hand and he said it's a rod yeah a stick it's just a stick but God said it's enough amen hallelujah amen and God told Moses Thou shalt take this rod in thy hand wherewith Thou shalt do signs amen and the Bible says in Exodus 4:20 Moses took his wife and his sons and set them upon an ass and he returned to the land of Egypt and Moses took the rod of God in his hand notice when Moses had the stick in his hand it was Moses stick but when he gave it to God it became God's amen hallelujah when he left the burning bush the the rod belonged to God just a simple stick just a run how insignificant that appears to be a stick against the greatest army think about that can you imagine here's this 80y old man with his beard blowing in the wind got his wife and children up on a donkey and he's going down the road with a stick in his head and they say hey oh man where you going man yeah I'm going down to Egypt what are you going to do when you get there sign up for Social Security nope I'm going down and I'm going to take over amen yeah come on now oh man you've lost your mind yes he did yes he did he lost his mind and got the mind of God oh if my thoughts is contrary to God's thoughts God give me Grace to reject my thoughts and take God's thoughts amen oh Hallelujah but think about that for a minute that's that's that's so ridiculous you young people won't even amen it yeah think how ridiculous a stick going against an army that had helmets and they had swords and they had Shields and he had a stick how ridiculous but you see God chose the foolish things of the world to confound the wise and God have chose the weak things of the world to confound the things which are Mighty the world would laugh at a stick oh but the power of a rod in the hand of a prophet of God in the will of God Moses destroyed a nation and freed God's people listen Moses didn't go down there to steal Pharaoh's slaves he didn't go steal his slaves he told Moses said go in there and tell Pharaoh thus sayith the Lord Israel is my son amen he wasn't stealing Pharaoh's slaves he was redeeming his people amen yes sir amen got to make a Baptist shout hallelujah amen Oh my he destroyed a nation and freed God's people by the power of the rod of God in his hand what is in thine hand Moses a stick what is in thine hand David a slingshot two strings and a Leather Pouch and David standing there Facing a Giant yes who mocked his God who laughed at God's people now if you look at human reasoning who should have won this battle right who would have Vegas B it on right well you know it's the truth right right Goliath was a giant David was short yeah yeah Goliath was a warrior David was a Shepherd yeah come on now right Goliath was a man David was a boy Goliath was covered in armor David was covered in sheep skin yeah Goliath had a sword David had a slingshot amen right think about that right brother amen Goliath Not only was he a warrior he was a champion Warrior he had trophies right A Champion Warrior he knew how to fight did amen all David had do to do was play a harp write some songs who do you think should have won this battle Goliath had a challenge yeah that's right but David Hallelujah had the power of the Living God who was with David hallelujah what did David do goli said am I a dog that youd send a boy out to fight me David said bow well yeah that's right amen amen and he took that slingshot in a rock and slew a giant amen what is in that hand Samson standing there against a thousand Philistines who had ambushed him y a Jawbone of a mule a Jawbone of a mule in the hands that the prophet of God said Samson was a mama's boy a that's what he said and here he is this little fell standing you know the prophet said you you see this pictures of Samson with all these muscles so that that would be no mystery at all but he wasn't that kind of a man at all amen right now I worked in surgery for 17 years I worked in surgery did all kinds of operations operate on people I go to church with I tell them I know you inside and out amen and I've seen guys Carpenters that pick up wheelbarrows of brick and will pull this tendon this muscle right here Pull It Loose from the bone and they would come in and we would open them up and take like a 1050 staple and staple that tendon back to the Bone and then sew it up in 6 weeks 8 weeks they'd be good to go and that was just picking up a wheelbarrow of bricks yeah this guy picked up Gates that weighed eight tons a piece it should have tore ever tending in his body loose but it wasn't his oh God it wasn't his muscle it was his God and he slew a thousand Phil in a place called jaw those Philistines got more jaw than they ever wanted in their life amen the power of a Jawbone in the hand of a Believer called of God to destroy his enemy amen amen what is in that hand shamard think about this look at this Moses had a stick David had a slingshot Samson had a Jawbone yeah what shamgar got an ox goat a piece of wood with a brass knob on the end of it used to push the animals through the Corral and 600 Philistines came on his property looking for a fight every year they would come in at Harvest Time and would smack him around take off his heart and leave him with just enough to replant yeah and year after year after year he was feeding his enemy yes he was and we find the today that's what a lot of people do when they say I'm no good and God don't love me and nobody cares for me you are feeding your enemy amen amen amen we need to say what God says well I don't feel it he never said did you feel it he said did you believe it and if you start believing it you just might feel it well glory amen yes sir and shamard this year at Harvest time there was another seed come to maturity uhhuh come on now and he said I am the Seed of Abraham amen God gave me this land this belongs to me and he grabbed that Ox coat jumped out the window right in the middle of 600 Philistines yes and he there was he never acted like that before he never he usually just sat in church he never acted like what is wrong with this but what they failed to realize another had come to maturity that's right Amen on and shamard took that stick and he pulled it back like that and when he did you know what [Laughter] they are you serious what is that you're you're going to use that again you're killing them yes he's fixing [Applause] [Music] to amen amen he took that oxco hallelujah amen and destroyed 600 Philistines look right Moses nothing but a dry stick David nothing but two pieces of string and a Leather Pouch a slingshot Samson nothing but a dry up draw bone shamgar an ox goat look at this every time look at the pattern every time God's people were in a crisis God placed something in their hand to overcome their enemy with brother amen and he's no respective persons then in this hour that we live in I want to bring it down to us now in this hour that we live in when the world has gone crazy amen they ain't going they gone right the crazy you got men that think they're women right women think they're men got people thinks they're cats you can't make this stuff up I saw the other day where a man married himself yeah and half of him was in a tuxedo and the other half of him was in a wedding dress and he married himself I saw the other day I I've been keeping a little thing of it because there a little thought that I was looking at and a guy over in Italy married a pizza said he can find nobody that would love him as much as he loves pizza I thought my God in a week that marriage will be stale am you might as well laugh you know that's the truth that's good the world and then they look at us like we're crazy sorry about that yeah true pandemics and plagues and violence y right goliaths of cancer Philistines of fear armies of Oppression trouble on every side but yet God has not left us barehanded am huj for he said a little while the world will see me no more but ye shall see me I'll be with you even in you he promised us that so in this hour when people are saying I seen the other day where Time Magazine was a few years ago actually on the cover said where is God and I thought if they listen to me I'd tell them amen we know where he's at amen amen yes amen amen but in this time that we're living in he has not left us barehanded so I say to you this afternoon what is in thy hand young people what is in your what has God given you to overcome the hour you're living in yes on right of course we know it's the baptism of the the Holy Ghost the Seal of God Amen but I want to look at another weapon that God has placed in their hand you say brother you know you talked about the Moses and the David and the shamard I'm just a young person I'm not a pastor I'm not an evangelist I'm just a young person right but God has given you a weapon to meet the challenge of the hour amen amen yes you know a lot of times we think of a David and a Moses we think of these great people who' done great things and sometimes the devil wants you to believe that you could never obtain to that because that's that's David and that's Moses and that's Daniel on you know and one of my favorite characters in history is jono and a lot of people when you mention the name jono they think of a warrior on a horse with feathers and a flute music and and no doubt when I mentioned his name some of you probably thought of that jono a great warrior on a horse probably white no doubt but how many knows gono drove a car do you know that do you know jono rode in a ferris wheel at the World's Fair yes no could be you're not sure so what are you saying I'm simply saying this we get these images in our mind sometimes and it's not really the way it is at all David was just like this young fell right here that God used him to destroy a giant amen and if God can use David he can use one of you all maybe one of your names is David he can use one of you all amen amen amen and so we think sometimes well you know I'm not brother brandom or I'm not brother Dale and I'm not brother Louise I you know I I'm just a young person but God has giving you a weapon to meet the challenge of her hour now I'll hurry I know you got a Vince but let me think about this for a minute how many remembers the story BR told about the mother's the mother's prayer anybody remember that story let me me remind it to you there's a woman was sitting she on a checker dress and she was sitting in the meeting waiting for the meeting to start and there was a woman standing there who had a baby in her arms and the baby was sick and she noticed the woman had a prayer card and so the woman sitting in the seat really wasn't sick she was just in the meeting and so she turned to this mother and she said ma'am here take my seat the baby's sick and you're standing there with the CH here take my seat and she said no no she said no no it's fine just take my seat so she get up and let this mother sit down and she started to leave and she just felt led to pray for this mother right and she turned to her and she said ma'am can can I pray for your baby but she was thinking you know the woman's got got a prayer card no doubt she'll get called and the prophet of God will pray for the baby and God will heal the baby but she couldn't she just felt led to pray and she said can I pray for your baby she said well sure so she takes the baby and prays for the baby and gives it back to the mother and she goes up in the balcony and sits down and when the meeting was going on but they begin to call prayer cards and sure enough this woman got got called and she gets up on the platform with her baby and she stands before the prophet of God to get him to pray for the baby and the prophet said the baby's already healed am he said someone say so it's it's her up there on the balcony and the check her dress she paid for the baby you say what are you saying brother Dar I'm saying this you see God didn't choose the prophet with the gift of discernment he never choose that Prophet to pray for the baby but he chose this woman he used that woman you say you know I'm I'm not a pastor I'm not a preacher but God has giv you something and it's the power of prayer amen yeah amen amen she wasn't a preacher she wasn't an evangelist she she was just a mother but the prophet said God didn't choose for me to pray for the child but he chose that mother amen he said no doubt that woman thought that because I was the Evangelist and had the power to do the healing it should be me but he said I couldn't have compassion on that baby like she could see God uses you he molds you and shapes you the way he wants to use you amen hallelujah amen and the child got absolutely well and the prophet said every man today knows he can take the name of Jesus Christ and meet any foe in any place in any time he'll be defeated he said I've met Witch Doctors I've met Demons of All Sorts had never seen the time but what they bowed to the name of Jesus Christ when Moses went down to Egypt if they could ever got that stick out of his hand that had him whipped but in that stick was where the power laid if they ever got the stick out of his hand they had him whipped remember it was the stick that smoked the rock it was the stick that he held into the air it was a stick that he held over the water it was God's judgment rod and what the stick was in Moses hand the name of Jesus Christ is to the Born Again Church amen God's not gave us a stick he's not gave us a slingshot but he's gave us the power of prayer through the name of Jesus Christ Oh Glory to God take the name of Jesus with you child of sorrow and of Woe when temptation rounds you gathers breathe that holy name in prayer and watch demons scatter amen when men and women quit looking at their sickness and their diseases and start looking to what God said about it then you will take over well the doctor said it's bad but God said he's your healer well the doctor said I can't overcome it but God said you're already Overcomer amen all things are subject to Jesus Christ and yet all things are subject to you in prayer when you ask in the name of Jesus the power of Prayer in the name of Jesus held in the hand of a Believer amen the prophet said after all prayer now listen listen Moses had a stick David had a slingshot but God's gave you the power of prayer and the prophet said prayer is the most vital force that God ever put into the hand of mankind the most effective Force that's known to man is prayer amen it is he said God has given us the weapon of prayer prayer is not a burden no prayer is a weapon and it's not just given to pastors it's not just given to prophets but it's given to boys and girls and mamas and daddies and brothers and sisters amen amen amen that's right amen well glory be to God God then you see friends while you go all day and your phone won't Buzz one time and you go to your prayer closet and it's

weapon is prayer prayer is the most powerful weapon that was ever put in the hand of mankind yes sir who has it who's got it right every one of us yeah amen he placed it in your hand it's been there the whole time amen think about that for a minute is the key when it seems everything is shut out locked up when it seems like you're in prison when you just know way out prayer is your pasing amen come on right amen listen to me I've seen God do so many things through prayer amen I've seen blinded eyes open I've seen people get out of wheelchairs I've seen the dead raised I've seen God do tremendous things through the Simplicity of a prayer right simply believe in God that's even over your homework come on now amen amen the prophet of God said you should pray over your children's homework absolutely ask God to help them on test sir amen that's right amen so what do we do is get back into the program of God and find out what God wants us to do and the only way I know to do that is prayer you see young people you was born for a purpose you're not here by mistake you was born for a purpose and it's up to us us to go to God and say why am I here what is it you want me to do and the best way to find the answer to what God wants in your life is prayer right is prayer amen prayer is the key that's the answer prayer changes things it's the most powerful weapon that was ever put in control of human beings amen right notice who controls it amen you do yeah that's right if you don't pray it ain't nobody fault but yours that's right it's put in your hand amen come on Mom and Dad I'm talking to all of us right now amen that's amen amen you are in control of it amen they can throw me in prison and stop me from preaching but they can't stop me from praying no that's right come on amen amen the devil can put me in a car wreck break both legs set me up where I can't travel but he can't stop me from praying that's right well brother Dar he can take your voice away I can still pray yes sir amen amen amen yes sir amen you control it amen there's no atomic bomb no hydrogen bomb as powerful as prayer amen prayer will change the mind of God right think about that right no atomic bomb no hydrogen bomb now in 1945 before all of us most of us was born they dropped two bombs in Japan to end World War II one in nakasaki and one in Hiroshima fat boy and big boy if my memory served me right atomic bombs and these bombs were so powerful people were annihilated instantly when they exploded it just left a shadow on the road where they were standing and for years even now years later from 1945 2024 people are still being borned with birth defs from the result of the radiation of those two bombs and yet the prophet said your prayer is more powerful than that that a mother can pray for a wayward son and she can pass off the Earth and that prayer will circle the Earth for years and find that boy in a barroom Hallelujah I remember when I was a little boy my Sunday school teacher was Sister Clark and when I you know she she got older and she was sick and me and my wife stopped one night after church to see her and we went in and sister clark was telling me she said yeah yay Lord she always said yeah Lord Jesus is just a phras she had and we went in and she said yeah Lord Jesus she said when you was a little boy and I was your Sunday school teacher she said I've seen God had his hand on you and she said I prayed for you because I knew God was going to use you and I got out of the car and I started crying I said I said think of it when I was a total idiot running up and down the road like an idiot right God had a Godly sister praying for me amen Can someone say Amen to that someone prayed for me when I had all kinds of habits in my life so far from go come on now amen hallelujah thank you Lord amen no matter how powerful those two boms are yet your prayer is more powerful than that the power of Prayer in the hand of a Believer how much time do I God let me just look at a couple more here remember the prophet of God talked about the black woman down in Memphis and her boy had got out and got at a social disease and he was dying and she got down on her knees and she began to pray and she said Lord I was like the shoom my woman said I couldn't have a child and said you gave me a child and I tried to raised him the best I knew have but he got out with the wrong crowd be careful who you run around with young people he got out with the wrong crowd and he got this social disease and my boy's dying but she said Lord if I be like the shite woman where's your Elijah amen and the prophet of God was in an airplane flying over to Lexington Kentucky and all that was for whatever reason they had to make an emergency landing and they landed down in Memphis Tennessee and they put him up in the Peabody Hotel and the next morning he went out to mail a postcard and the Holy Spirit said turn around and start walking and he found himself in this neighborhood and he was singing I'm one of them I think it was or something like that and he saw her she was standing there up against the fence like this had a rag tied around her head her back was wet from the Dew and he come walking down the street and she saw him she said morning Barson right amen and he stopped the said Parson said how'd you know I was a preacher she said not only that sir I knew you coming she said where's your Satchel you're supposed to have a satchel amen and you know the story the prophet of God when did he said friends he said I've been in King's Palace and i' never felt more welcome than I did in that woman's house right he said I got down and I said uh would you pray and he said friends I could tell you when she got down begin to pray he said I could tell she had talked to him before and I wonder if someone heard us pray if they would say that about us he said I know she had talked to him before she said now will you pray he said said Lord if this is the reason I'm here said no doubt I've done miss my plan have mercy upon this young man touching Lord you know the story he said oh mama said it's getting light in the room and he said when I left he was sitting up on the side of the bed and he said I went racing back to get my stuff going to the airport just knew I missed my flight he said but I went through the doors of the airport every time I fly into Memphis I think about this he said when I went through the doors of the airport I heard over intercom last call for Lexington Kentucky and the prophet said the prayer of that black woman grounded an airplane Hallelujah and held it on the ground until he could go pray for her son that's the power of prayer you take a truck out there and try to stop that play from taking off he'll beat you down that Runway oh my but the power of the pray of a mother praying for her son that was dying grounded an airplane and held it on the ground the power of prayer oh do you love him this afternoon amen Amen Let me let me skip some of this the prophet of God said let everything be secondary everything be secondary in your life but your prayer life said I'm not saying this to scare you I'm saying it just as sely as I know how to stand here in this platform and say it but my heart's been stirred for a time I know that we're ready for something now to come in and you Christians don't stay in that lukewarm condition anymore lay aside everything just get as close to God as you can walk with him and talk with him amen let everything be secondary but your prayer life stay right with him all the time put your prayer life first come on now amen amen amen he said I'm saying it as sanely as I know how to say it put your prayer life first amen I'm not going to ask you this morning I'm not going to ask you this afternoon where your prayer L is on your list come on brother but if it's not first God help us to leave here with this Revelation I'm going to put my prayer life first amen amen

Lise if I could pray like my mother or my daddy I I would pray brother darl but I can't pray like them but listen to me there is nobody can pray like you can pray God allows things to come in our life

and know what our heart is trying to say because you see God it's not a great prayer or a fancy prayer that gets God's attention it's a sincere prayer amen from a sincere heart amen that's right what is in thine hand Moses had a simple stick David had a slingshot Samson had a Jawbone jamu guard had a o scope what's in your head amen yes what's in your hand just a simple prayer because we're we

let's go to the enemy's Camp let's take back what he stole from us let's take this weapon of prayer against our enemy amen hallelujah amen do you love him God Amen this is the confidence that we have in him that if we ask anything according to his will he hears us amen the power of prayer I was in chac Alaska as a sister come to the Altar and she said brother Daryl my boy's out of church said I

of William Brandon and I said yes sir his grandkids go to my church this guy went ballistic he talked all the way from Alexander Louisiana to Atlanta Georgia am and when we got off the plane he shook my hand and he went one way and I went the other and I was walking down that tarmac there and I got to thinking you know that's just like God two months before that man ever knew he had a question yeah God done had the answer sitting beside him amen am you see if he'd sat beside any other person they probably said no sir never heard of him right but God answers prayer amen do you love him yes let's bow our heads thank you Heavenly Father Lord we're so grateful for this weapon of prayer father I pray Lord as I know it's been an unusual young people's meeting and maybe they come expecting to hear something else but Lord in this hour that we're living in is such a raging of a war and the violence in the land lord may we come to call their attention dear God to what's already been placed in their hand well if I had this if I had that but oh God what we already possess Lord help us dear God to take this weapon of prayer and use it against their enemy when the devil tries to come and tell us that we can't be healed or we can't have a closer walk or we can't have the Holy Ghost or we can't live a Godly life father that weapon of prayer to call upon your name to come Lord and reinforce your word to our lives father God if it don't happen when we pray that night we'll believe it for the next day and the next day or the next week or the next month we'll never quit believing that you heard our prayer God and Lord no doubt there's many people people here could testify of they praying for something and how you answered it and God I pray in the name of Jesus Lord that we don't have to be 90 year old or 50 year old or 30 year old we don't have to be a mom and a daddy we don't have to be a pastor and evangelist before we can pray but just a child Lord that childlike Faith like the little boy kneeling at the altar saying his ABCs and yet God you know how to take the letters and put the words together father sometimes when I don't know what to say with my with my with my educ ation then listen to My Heart Lord let my heart speak that which you need to hear Lord father I pray that these young people today would take this Lord and that they would use it dear God Lord that it wouldn't be prayer would not be a burden or it wouldn't be just something they do in church but Lord when they get up in the morning when they go to bed at night Lord when they're when they're on recess when they're sitting at a red light and the parents are wherever they would be Lord we can simple whisper a word of prayer to you and God may we use it as the prophet of God said try it and watch demons scatter Lord we believe that the power of prayer Grant it today Lord I pray in Jesus name amen would you just raise your hand and say brother Daryl if would you just pray for me that I would use this weapon in a greater way I maybe I've not understood it exactly right but now the things that the prophet has said and it's called my remembrance and I'm want to exercise and use this God given gift of prayer I want to use it against my enemy amen God bless that hand and that hand and that hand hand that hand that hand God bless you God sees your tears God bless your hand young man amen God bless your hand thank God bless your hand yes oh Father my hands up too Lord take us today dear God into thy hands Lord hear our humble prayer dear God may you move for these needs dear God today and those have a desire to use this weapon oh God may they be REM remed of your word Lord when you said there in Jeremiah call unto me and I will answer thee father God we just come Lord with that confidence that when we pray thou hearest us Lord As you stood at the grave of Lazareth that day you said I thank thee father that thou hearest me when I pray yeah I thank thee that thou always heareth me thank you Lord thank you Lord for hearing our prayers in Jesus name we pray amen and amen do you love him brother Le Come and sing a song buddy or brother who amen God bless you Saints good job let's stand to our feet let's sing a song If you have a need you know brother Daryl I was thinking about when you was preaching we talking about prayer I just come back to the Lord I still had a couple of Partners in our business and and we went out to eat one one uh day during U work time and we went to this restaurant we all we all eat the same thing steak and graving potatoes peas we all order the same thing cuz a good place to eat so I bowed my head I prayed they didn't cuz they're not they were Sinners we got finished eating and the next morning about 4:00 in the morning I got a phone call from both of them and they said we're throwing up and got diarrhea and said are you what's wrong with you I said I'm fine I said I must be going to have to take both of y'all's job too this after today you know they said well we all eat the same thing you didn't get sick I said there's a difference I pray that God would take that food and it change anything in it that was bad that's why I pray over food I don't pray just blessed because of it Hey listen we live in America you can eat just about anywhere you want to but you don't know where that food come from what how it's been handled you don't know what's in it but when you pray you pray an Earnest prayer Lord bless this food amen no Lord change the very atoms in that food that's what he did he there was something bad in them other two whatever that was the three things we eat probably the meat but God actually changed the atams in that food and it was good for me but them two guys stay sck for a couple of days so we go back and eat out and eat about two 3 months later and we go the same place we didn't get the same thing that time but I stopped and they all looked at me and they didn't pick their Fork up you know they're looking at me and I said you want me to pray over your food they said yeah please pray over our food so the power of prayer amen try it sometime it's cheap it's easy you don't have to pay
