[2:30] because you know I understand and all

[3:58] to just say all right we take whatever
[4:00] comes and and we'll work from there okay
[4:03] so we'll try to pick up our thought this
[4:05] afternoon right Romans 8 Genesis to
[4:08] Heavenly Father we thank you for your
[4:10] grace and your love unto us thank you
[4:12] Lord that you can speak to us that you
[4:16] can burden Us in certain ways and and
[4:19] open our eyes in other ways and we pray
[4:21] that you'd help us and we believe father
[4:24] that we we try to do the best we can so
[4:27] just just take us and use us for what
[4:29] whatever Lord and and we thank you for
[4:31] letting us know sometimes ahead of time
[4:33] when things are going to be different
[4:35] maybe uh somebody's sick something's
[4:38] wrong but we we know that you're with us
[4:40] and we thank you have your way guide us
[4:43] now as we read your word and speak about
[4:44] you keep us in Jesus name amen Romans
[4:51] 8 we're glad that brother dick sister
[4:54] Gail didn't get to go to Florida too you
[4:58] know they might not be but but we
[5:01] are okay Romans 8:
[5:03] 2028 and we know that all things work
[5:06] together for good to them that love God
[5:08] to them who are the called according to
[5:10] his purpose for whom he did for know he
[5:12] did also predestinate to be conformed to
[5:15] the image of his son that he might be
[5:17] the firstborn among many Brethren
[5:19] moreover whom he did predestinate them
[5:22] he also called and whom he called them
[5:24] he also Justified and whom he justified
[5:26] them he also glorified what shall we
[5:30] then say to these things if God be for
[5:32] us who can be against us amen let's go
[5:35] over to Genesis now and
[5:37] we'll pick up uh we'll just start with
[5:41] verse
[5:42] four of Genesis 2 these are the
[5:45] generations of the heavens and the earth
[5:47] when they were created in the day that
[5:48] the Lord God made the earth and the
[5:51] heavens and every plant of the field be
[5:55] before it was in the earth and every
[5:57] herb of the field before it grew for the
[5:59] Lord God had not caused it to rain upon
[6:02] the Earth and there was not a man to
[6:04] till the
[6:05] ground but there went up a mist from the
[6:07] earth and watered the whole face of the
[6:09] ground the Lord God formed Man Out of
[6:12] the Dust of the ground and breathed into
[6:14] his nostrils the breath of life and he
[6:16] became a living
[6:19] soul and the Lord God planted a garden
[6:22] Eastward in Eden and there he put the
[6:24] man whom he had formed amen you may be
[6:26] seated the Lord had his Blessing to the
[6:30] reading of the
[6:32] word now we know
[6:36] that uh we've been through it and uh it
[6:41] did give us this morning a little bit to
[6:42] back into the natural and and speak
[6:45] sometimes of things instead of I'm kind
[6:48] of more or less a push on push on
[6:51] sometimes I have to divert around and
[6:52] that's good it helps me helps you so you
[6:54] know we all get to benefit but we've
[6:58] been studying quite a while about the
[7:00] the Genesis 126 and 27 man the uh
[7:05] spiritual
[7:07] man uh the as we call it the the Son of
[7:12] God the
[7:15] uh God creating his own
[7:19] children and not uh being a
[7:23] creation but to be you know it's not
[7:26] something I I hope you followed the
[7:28] message so far uh we're not talking
[7:31] about God creating his children we're
[7:35] talking about God bringing his children
[7:36] into being cuz there's a lot of
[7:38] difference in the understanding of of
[7:41] creating something because then you
[7:43] begin to get the thoughts of of uh you
[7:46] know the uh uh something that didn't
[7:50] have any be I mean that had a beginning
[7:52] something that has an ending and stuff
[7:54] like that and you can get away from that
[7:56] and get into the understanding of seeing
[7:59] what's really taking place because that
[8:02] man that was created there was what was
[8:05] it it was
[8:08] God bringing
[8:10] forth the uh part that we were to be the
[8:15] the being and all and and being that but
[8:18] yet uh it's only one man now when we get
[8:21] back kind of towards the end of the
[8:23] message we we will get back to this
[8:25] where brother BR says God
[8:27] created a man he said now not all man
[8:31] right see this is not talking about the
[8:33] creation of all people right this is
[8:36] talking about a special creation of God
[8:40] himself to be made manifest on Earth in
[8:43] a form called the people of God you know
[8:47] and and being and that way it's a it's
[8:50] not a
[8:51] beginning it's a bringing
[8:54] forth It's a changing of form that we've
[8:57] been through over and over and over
[8:59] because that way then see he didn't have
[9:02] to create a
[9:04] man when he said let us make man in our
[9:06] own image it didn't mean that there
[9:09] wasn't that and then he created
[9:12] that it's meaning that he's bringing
[9:15] into being as we were trying to discuss
[9:18] at the Bible Study last night that you
[9:23] know this is to me is God revealing
[9:26] himself that's right the whole Bible the
[9:29] whole plan everything is God revealing
[9:33] himself right all right now for
[9:37] us we're on this side of it the
[9:40] recipiant or what you call it the
[9:42] receivers of
[9:43] Salvation right and I believe that
[9:47] eternal life that you have in you today
[9:51] by the new birth that that eternal life
[9:54] never had a beginning right right but I
[9:57] believe you and I had a beginning amen
[9:59] but now we're going to talk about
[10:02] Adam now the natural man Adam is will
[10:05] cover he had a
[10:08] beginning his body was not
[10:11] Eternal all right because he was
[10:15] created but the part that was placed
[10:18] within
[10:19] him we'll find as to be the part of God
[10:24] all right and we we you know we try to
[10:27] look at those things and follow it in a
[10:30] line
[10:31] see the natural creation of
[10:35] man took place on the sixth
[10:38] day you know the physical creation but
[10:42] the spiritual creation or the spiritual
[10:46] man just why what can you use what words
[10:49] can you use can I leave creation out of
[10:51] it no there's no way to talk can I leave
[10:54] beginning out of it no there's no way to
[10:57] talk but to people who understand what
[11:00] you're doing then see you can
[11:03] say he's the beginning of the creation
[11:05] of God but that's
[11:07] scripture and the prophet of God see
[11:09] said we are the rest of that creation
[11:12] well right now every how that Jesus
[11:15] Christ would be the beginning of the
[11:17] creation of
[11:19] God and I know that goes into the
[11:21] physical part of the body right which
[11:23] will be as we try to cover in the rest
[11:25] of the message today if we can to get
[11:27] down to you and I
[11:30] that our bodies one day will be made
[11:32] Eternal
[11:33] also but he was the beginning of the
[11:35] creation of God that was when God be to
[11:39] reveal what he was doing this is a
[11:42] revealing of God this is not a physical
[11:45] happening as I was explaining to him
[11:47] last night about the the uh Revelations
[11:52] 5 that's not a physical
[11:54] happening that's the acts or scene of a
[11:57] play you know and it what it's doing is
[12:01] is showing how God is revealing himself
[12:05] amen he's making himself known to you
[12:07] and I right well to make yourself known
[12:10] to you and I we are going to have to be
[12:13] of the same supernatural being to
[12:17] understand because the natural man
[12:20] cannot comprehend the things of God all
[12:23] right and in in doing that then see we
[12:26] had to have something so watch it in a
[12:28] minute
[12:30] Now watch how we we come
[12:33] forth not as the
[12:36] beginning but we that have eternal life
[12:39] today and I believe you must receive
[12:42] eternal life I don't believe as the
[12:44] people of the message teaching that you
[12:46] come into the world with eternal life I
[12:48] don't believe that even now watch Even
[12:52] Adam never came into the world with
[12:55] eternal life that's
[12:57] right God had to to breathe into his
[13:00] nostrils all right now if anybody would
[13:02] have started with it looked like Adam
[13:04] should
[13:05] have but the man Adam had to receive
[13:07] eternal life all right so if you and I
[13:11] have eternal life now that eternal life
[13:14] never had a beginning amen right but you
[13:16] and I did amen we had a time we have to
[13:19] be born again but now watch how
[13:22] wonderful it ties together with the
[13:25] understanding because as we read there
[13:27] in the scripture
[13:31] it says that God breathed into the
[13:34] nostrils of Adam and he become a living
[13:39] Soul
[13:40] now that's a wonderful thought a living
[13:45] soul we'll find in a minute that that
[13:47] was eternal life amen but you and I as a
[13:51] baby when a baby is born into the world
[13:53] God has to breathe into that baby's
[13:55] nostrils and it becomes a living soul
[13:59] all but it doesn't become an eternal
[14:03] one it's not like Adam you remember my
[14:06] point this being that when God
[14:09] begins doing
[14:13] something he doesn't begin it full grown
[14:16] I mean as a baby It Begins full
[14:19] grown all right so then if we watch
[14:23] Adam then we can see what to expect in
[14:26] you and
[14:27] I
[14:30] okay because Adam coming forth would be
[14:33] an example to you and me so let's watch
[14:37] him as he comes into being a and the
[14:40] doings and all and what God does to
[14:42] bring this man into
[14:44] being and then we can understand what
[14:48] would happen to bring us into being you
[14:50] know in the in the bases of what we're
[14:52] seeing all right so then to think about
[14:54] it the first man was made a spiritual
[14:57] being in in the image of God a
[15:00] supernatural
[15:02] being he was a leader of the animals in
[15:04] the
[15:05] garden all of those things we've been
[15:08] through it how that he comes down to
[15:11] that position and there's only one that
[15:14] would have eternal
[15:16] life so the eternal life that God would
[15:20] give to Adam would not be a
[15:23] beginning but would what would be the
[15:25] word what is a good word for that an
[15:28] extens
[15:31] a multiplication of God or or bringing
[15:33] forth you know as God just bringing it
[15:37] into
[15:38] being and not creating it we get away
[15:41] from those words creation or get away
[15:43] from the word beginning cuz you can't
[15:45] read the Bible correctly then cuz you
[15:47] read in the beginning was the word well
[15:50] there's a time when the word
[15:52] begin in the beginning was the word so
[15:55] the time the word begin and the word is
[15:57] with God so God began
[16:00] you see what I'm
[16:01] saying those are human
[16:05] terminologies but are not expressing the
[16:08] understanding of what's taking place
[16:11] because God never had a beginning that's
[16:13] right it never had a ending you say but
[16:17] yet that's talking about uh the flesh no
[16:21] the Bible's for sick in the beginning
[16:22] was word where with God the Word was God
[16:25] then verse
[16:27] 14 says and the Word was made flesh
[16:30] right and dwelt among us
[16:33] see that spiritual man come down to
[16:37] dwell with natural man amen that
[16:41] spiritual man of almighty God came into
[16:44] being to come down and dwell upon Earth
[16:47] in a body called Jesus Christ all right
[16:51] now let's watch how that comes into
[16:53] being and then think about
[16:56] ourselves and consider our own s eles in
[16:59] in the things that we're doing so now
[17:01] Man was created on the sixth day
[17:04] physically he was created before the
[17:06] foundation of the world as the spiritual
[17:08] man the 126 man as I said a moment ago
[17:12] that's not everybody that's only one
[17:14] man there's only one man that's ever had
[17:17] or ever will have eternal
[17:19] life right he said wait a minute now he
[17:22] can give eternal life yeah but you
[17:25] didn't understand what I was saying
[17:28] eternal life is
[17:30] God that's God's own life if he imparts
[17:33] it it's still what he done all right but
[17:37] think about it
[17:38] now this spiritual man in the image of
[17:42] God the Loos the opony ETC Son of
[17:48] God was not another being separate from
[17:51] God right but was a part of God
[17:55] Amen right now that's what we've been
[17:59] trying to get to point to you a part of
[18:01] God all right then that supernatural
[18:05] being being a part of
[18:11] God then it had no beginning right now
[18:16] I'm not talking about Adam we're going
[18:17] to get to that just a second Adam the
[18:20] flesh man had a
[18:23] beginning all brother Brown says on the
[18:26] future home paragraph 431
[18:28] 32 he
[18:30] said that the tree of
[18:33] life was in the garden to remind Adam
[18:37] that his newth youth was continually
[18:39] going
[18:40] on even the way he was
[18:44] placed even to bring into Adam as we'll
[18:47] read in a minute that supernatural
[18:53] being even into Adam and doing that
[18:57] still that didn't make that body Eternal
[19:01] right just because we have eternal life
[19:04] in our
[19:04] soul does not make the body Eternal am
[19:08] even the body of
[19:12] Jesus it was not Eternal it had a
[19:15] beginning that's why I brought around
[19:16] and said you see Jesus had a beginning
[19:19] he said but God had no beginning he said
[19:21] Jesus had a beginning he said he had a
[19:23] mother and a
[19:24] father we know his mother and father was
[19:26] almighty God the word
[19:28] all right now but coming down to seeing
[19:32] what we
[19:34] doing and looking at
[19:36] Adam as God beginning him as full grown
[19:41] he gives an
[19:43] example of what he wants all of his
[19:46] children to be an example in
[19:50] Adam that spiritual man had control of
[19:52] the
[19:53] earth he ruled the animals now once he
[19:57] was put into flesh he didn't lose that
[20:00] ability he could control the animals and
[20:03] even in his lost estate the animals are
[20:06] still afraid of mankind and are
[20:10] easily uh trained by
[20:14] man you know because they recognize him
[20:17] as their ruler and any animal that there
[20:20] is wants you to be not mean to
[20:25] it but it wants you to be dominant
[20:30] ating you know it wants you to be in
[20:35] command see because they say that like a
[20:38] horse that it can tell whether or not
[20:40] you're
[20:42] scared they can
[20:44] tell and if you're scared the horse is
[20:47] scared that's right but if you're not
[20:50] scared then see it becomes to the bases
[20:53] it knows you're in
[20:56] control all
[20:58] you take a
[21:00] dog and it can be vicious but yet to
[21:03] some people that dog is not vicious at
[21:05] all cuz he knows they're in
[21:08] control and he'll respect that person
[21:11] now he might attack other
[21:14] people because that's the feeling that
[21:16] that in some way it knows whether you're
[21:19] in charge or not all right but now think
[21:22] about
[21:23] it Adam's Body was not Eternal so when
[21:26] it says you know
[21:28] he created a
[21:30] man we know Genesis 1 was the spiritual
[21:33] creation Genesis 2 is the physical
[21:36] creation of mankind all right and God
[21:40] breathed into his
[21:42] nostrils the physical
[21:45] creation and he became a living Soul now
[21:48] I want you to watch
[21:50] that watch that part and he became a
[21:54] living
[21:56] soul and you'll see that that we wasn't
[21:58] born with eternal
[22:02] life we must receive eternal life amen
[22:05] amen and to receive eternal life we
[22:08] become a living Soul that's right you
[22:10] say well now brother Dale do you mean
[22:12] that the other people that are not born
[22:15] again or or not a living no but they're
[22:18] not that kind of a living
[22:20] Soul there're a living Soul because they
[22:24] are given
[22:26] life right yeah but only those who have
[22:30] eternal
[22:32] life can be qualified or counted as a
[22:36] living
[22:39] Soul so you following what I'm saying
[22:42] because the Bible says they're dead
[22:43] while they living Paul said you were
[22:45] dead in
[22:51] sin only those that are born
[22:55] again so now here's what we're going to
[22:57] get to so so I'm going to say it and
[22:58] then back up get into the
[23:00] message so when God breathe into your
[23:05] nostrils eternal
[23:08] life by the new
[23:12] birth are you
[23:14] listening by the new birth and only by
[23:17] the new birth can you and I be Eternal
[23:21] so when he breathes into our
[23:24] nostrils you might be 10 years old 40
[23:26] years old 80 years old whatever you
[23:29] know until that time you're not a living
[23:33] Soul well come on just get off of it
[23:37] just listen to what I'm
[23:39] saying I've explained that a second ago
[23:42] when God breathes into your a baby's
[23:44] nostrils it becomes a living person a
[23:46] living soul but it doesn't have eternal
[23:54] life so when you receive the new birth
[24:00] you then become a living
[24:04] Soul that's the way we should have come
[24:08] y That's
[24:09] right
[24:11] right we shouldn't have to went through
[24:13] the fall but we
[24:15] did so when you receive the new birth
[24:17] you become a living
[24:19] Soul you have eternal
[24:22] life now follow that point because see
[24:25] what happened to Adam
[24:30] Adam was both male and female
[24:33] right and even in the spiritual creation
[24:36] we've covered that that even when Adam
[24:38] was put in
[24:41] flesh Adam was lonely because Eve was
[24:43] still in
[24:46] theophany until God created a flesh
[24:50] taken from
[24:51] Adam and place within her that
[24:55] part that she was to be
[24:58] amen that theophany that
[25:01] Soul cuz I believe your soul is your
[25:04] theophany right I believe a sinner soul
[25:07] is his theophany it's his body that he's
[25:10] going places he's going downward but to
[25:13] a true Christian is going upward all
[25:16] right but see God took that part that he
[25:21] see I use the word set aside that makes
[25:23] another Point
[25:25] see the human mind
[25:29] I believe in the expanding of
[25:33] God and I believe that's what he's been
[25:35] doing
[25:37] right that he is expanding himself and
[25:41] as I've tried to explain to
[25:43] you see we want to take great father up
[25:46] here and he want to make a logos over
[25:49] here and a this over here and a
[25:52] man and and and we want to R this out
[25:55] put this over here I never have believed
[25:59] that I believe the more that God
[26:03] unfolds of himself even to the foolish
[26:07] virgins the people given eternal
[26:10] life I believe that's enhancing him am
[26:14] not doing away with what's here that's
[26:17] what we want all God was he p in and all
[26:20] Christ
[26:21] he we see then you're running out of
[26:26] God
[26:29] see that way it takes a revelation
[26:32] amen I listen we was the other day to
[26:35] brother random and he's talking about I
[26:37] would he said it's got to be
[26:39] revealed when the lady asked him one you
[26:42] one of the questions said you know how
[26:44] could he
[26:45] be two people and all like that he said
[26:49] it's got to be
[26:51] revealed one God has got to be revealed
[26:54] what I'm talking about today has got to
[26:56] be revealed to you I'm not talking of
[26:59] the little six and seven sermons of
[27:01] other people I'm trying my best to get
[27:03] you and I to do as the prophet said he
[27:06] said when the Bri bride realizes who she
[27:09] is and what she's here for right then
[27:13] she'll be able to speak things into
[27:17] existence that's paraphrased it in my
[27:19] language then she'll be able to be used
[27:21] of
[27:23] God but until that time we're
[27:26] not we're not at that place right we're
[27:29] in the growth
[27:31] development all right and I don't
[27:33] believe all God poured into to the
[27:35] church is completed
[27:38] until all the members of the body of
[27:40] Christ coming in it's all right so we're
[27:44] in a
[27:45] process all right now so follow what I'm
[27:49] talking
[27:51] about before the foundation of the world
[27:55] God said let us make man right and he
[27:58] made a spiritual
[28:00] being eternal
[28:03] life right that was a part of his
[28:07] life part of
[28:09] him not like a part of him like a part
[28:11] like a leg or an arm or what a part of
[28:14] God is
[28:17] God you you can't have God in
[28:21] Parts well he's here part no no it's
[28:25] that's why John could represent the
[28:27] bride of
[28:29] Christ on the a of
[28:31] patmas why because he had eternal life
[28:35] right so anyone with eternal life can
[28:37] represent all the rest of the body right
[28:40] right all right now that's what I've
[28:42] been trying to get you to
[28:44] see but look what
[28:47] happened this natural man came into
[28:51] being natural man Adam there was no man
[28:53] to K the soil all right so
[28:58] he put him in the garden brother brand
[28:59] said there he stood said I can you see I
[29:02] read it to you the other day there
[29:05] stands Adam coming up out of the earth
[29:06] that his feet sticking into the very
[29:08] Earth did he come
[29:10] from yeah but what's he
[29:13] doing see then God breed into his
[29:17] nostrils the Bible says and he became a
[29:20] living
[29:21] Soul all right now so what happened was
[29:26] that God put the spiritual
[29:31] creation
[29:33] right into the physical
[29:36] creation right all
[29:39] right making him
[29:45] Adam with eternal
[29:49] life he put into him the things so go
[29:52] ahead and pick up number six now and
[29:55] we'll try to get
[29:59] started and
[30:03] uh this is taken from the deity of Jesus
[30:06] Christ paragraph 49 11 uh
[30:11] 12:25 but there was no man to till a
[30:14] soil so God made Man Out of the Dust of
[30:16] the earth and that
[30:19] man he might have given him hands like a
[30:22] monkey he might have give him feet like
[30:24] a bar whatever he did he just throwed it
[30:28] together and made a
[30:30] man but this man what he put this
[30:34] Immortal Spirit That Never Dies into
[30:38] this
[30:39] man and he become more than a
[30:42] brute he become a
[30:45] man he put this spiritual
[30:49] man as we'll read more
[30:52] quotes he put this Genesis 12 126 man
[30:55] into Genesis 2:7 right orever what it is
[30:59] two two yeah seven right all
[31:02] right then it makes you an I remember
[31:05] the prophet said he said a man without
[31:08] the Holy Ghost is nothing more than a
[31:10] brute an
[31:13] animal all right so he's expressing he
[31:16] puts this Immortal Spirit That Never
[31:18] Dies into this man and he become more
[31:21] than a brute he become a man right going
[31:25] to the next one which is one that's
[31:28] preached in
[31:29] 1962 uh to1 paragraph 145
[31:34] 146 see nothing has a soul but man you
[31:39] go through the things that sheep don't
[31:41] have no you don't know God put he's an
[31:44] an he's an animal form that's true but
[31:48] he put a soul on him that's what made
[31:50] him different from the
[31:52] animals he know right from wrong when
[31:56] his soul come on him but he remember
[32:00] when God created man in his own image
[32:03] and then he become a living Soul see he
[32:06] become that knowing right from wrong so
[32:09] now
[32:11] remember we are talking
[32:15] today only of Adam
[32:19] right right right do everybody with me
[32:23] will you agree with me or what you do
[32:25] you remember what I said this is talking
[32:27] about Adam this is not the creation of
[32:29] all
[32:31] mankind Adam was the first man of the
[32:36] Earth all right this is not talking
[32:39] about when you come into the world and
[32:42] what you
[32:45] get this is talking about Adam and how
[32:49] everything
[32:50] begun all right so keep that in mind now
[32:52] what we're talking about look at number
[32:56] eight uh questions and answers 6 uh 54
[33:00] 516
[33:02] 5:15 paragraph 280 and if God made man
[33:05] in his own image what kind of a man did
[33:08] he make then a spirit man in Genesis 2
[33:11] there was no man to tell the soil and
[33:13] God made Man Out of the Dust of the
[33:14] earth not in His image but in the image
[33:18] of animal and he put the spirit of man
[33:22] in this animal here and he become a
[33:26] living soul mhm right now that's the
[33:29] difference between a man and an
[33:32] animal as I said now keep in your mind
[33:36] we're only talking about
[33:40] Adam I've explained it over and over to
[33:42] you that even the man in the natural
[33:45] estate of being lost he still has a
[33:48] superiority over the
[33:50] animals but he's talking about putting
[33:53] this
[33:54] Spirit of this 126 man man
[33:59] into the Genesis to man right now follow
[34:04] him on then the cruelty of sin the
[34:07] penalty that cost
[34:09] man which is uh
[34:11] 53403 paragraph
[34:14] 55 made him out of the Dust of the earth
[34:18] now not in his own
[34:20] image he had already made the
[34:23] man
[34:25] right
[34:27] he didn't make the Genesis two Man In
[34:28] His Image he made him image of an animal
[34:30] he already created a man right then he
[34:33] breathed into him the breath of
[34:38] life now and he become a living
[34:42] Soul so the soul of man is the nature of
[34:44] the spirit so he breathed into him in
[34:47] other words he put Genesis 1:26
[34:51] into Genesis 27 right and Adam became a
[34:57] living Soul that's what made him a
[34:58] living
[35:02] Soul it would have done no good to just
[35:04] gave him natural
[35:07] life he gave him eternal life that's
[35:10] what we're going to read all
[35:13] right so
[35:14] that's going to the next one this is
[35:18] questions and answers on Genesis 53 729
[35:23] paragraph
[35:25] 46
[35:27] now but then there was no man to tell
[35:29] the soil Genesis 2 no man to tell the
[35:32] soil and then God formed man Genesis 27
[35:35] Out of the Dust of the earth and we
[35:37] follow it he formed Man Out of the Dust
[35:39] of the earth and put this Supernatural
[35:43] spirit all right I'm just trying to
[35:45] establish a point in your mind what
[35:47] happened in the
[35:49] garden God put to Genesis 1 26 and 27
[35:54] man into the Genesis 2 man and he called
[35:59] him a living soul but this living Soul
[36:02] had eternal life we'll read that in a
[36:05] minute watch now we'll get to this one
[36:08] also he comes on down and he's jump
[36:10] things he he breathe breathe the breath
[36:14] of life into him he become a living Soul
[36:18] now he began to move on and move on he
[36:21] become a living
[36:23] Soul when he breathed into his nostrils
[36:27] all right now let's read we've read this
[36:30] before but did you follow it let's read
[36:32] Blasphemous names of what he says about
[36:34] this
[36:35] man all right so let's start and just
[36:37] read we got a whole bunch of reading
[36:39] from this but I want you to follow the
[36:41] thought this is taken from uh
[36:43] blasphemist names paragraph 184 through
[36:47] about 191 somewhere in
[36:50] there now Jehovah Witnesses in their
[36:52] book it says that the breath that you
[36:54] breathe is the
[36:55] soul
[36:57] now now that cannot be right the breath
[37:00] that you breathe is not Soul if it is
[37:02] you're you're one time you're one kind
[37:04] of a soul next time you're something
[37:06] else as breathe that soul look where
[37:10] you'd be see now the breath is the wind
[37:14] and the wind is where you breathe into
[37:16] your nostrils now they take the
[37:18] scripture from back and look what they
[37:21] use and God breathed into his nostrils
[37:24] and he became a living Soul that's the
[37:27] scripture because remember ever
[37:31] Doctrine has a scriptural
[37:34] background I didn't say the scripture
[37:39] background every Doctrine starts from
[37:41] the scriptures of what people interpret
[37:44] it to
[37:45] be right not that's what that's what
[37:49] Run's explaining that's not what the
[37:50] scripture is talking
[37:54] about all right
[37:59] now they take the scripture from back
[38:00] and God breathed breath into his
[38:01] nostrils and then became a living Soul
[38:03] words that's their way of explain it
[38:06] that you become a living Soul when he
[38:08] breathe so then when you breathe your
[38:11] soul goes out somebody else breathes in
[38:15] I'm me today I'm brother colie in the
[38:17] second I'm backwards and
[38:20] forth he said that's not the
[38:23] soul right amen now watch it then
[38:29] now I want to ask you something if he
[38:31] was a man what kind of breath was he
[38:33] breathing before God breathed his breath
[38:35] of life into him see what kind of breath
[38:37] he was a breathing living man well then
[38:40] if that be so then every animals a
[38:42] living Soul cuz they breathe a human
[38:44] soul and our soul and all together so
[38:47] now you're saying that not just people
[38:49] breathe in each other Soul now the
[38:51] animals would bre breathing and get into
[38:55] if you want to study something something
[38:57] without getting massively
[39:00] confused go into the the uh strong
[39:04] concordance and pick up the word
[39:09] soul and follow it in comparison with
[39:12] the word
[39:14] spirit and you'll find that it's a total
[39:17] interchangeable word right and it's
[39:20] numes or something like that it's I
[39:23] forgot how to pronounce it I don't
[39:24] really you know and I couldn't even
[39:26] spell it but it's something to that it
[39:27] just means
[39:29] life
[39:31] life see that's what man thinks of a
[39:33] soul
[39:36] life you
[39:37] know no life eat it
[39:42] life right so we can breathe in and out
[39:46] life no it's it's the point I'm telling
[39:49] you read
[39:52] it the only defining of between Soul and
[39:55] Spirit in the Bible is Hebrews what is
[39:58] it
[40:00] 4:12 the word has to
[40:03] divide because in the the strongest
[40:06] concordance even where it uses
[40:08] Spirit there is only one definition of
[40:11] spirit and when it says holy spirit it's
[40:14] the same definition as is the spirit of
[40:16] man right because they couldn't Define
[40:19] it but what have I always
[40:21] said what the text that it's talking
[40:24] about right
[40:26] explains what it is if it say in Holy
[40:30] Spirit it means the spirit of
[40:33] God if it says man's spirit it's just
[40:35] man's spirit all right we' tried to be
[40:38] through that through the years to help
[40:40] us to understand but
[40:44] watch see he said Brothers the arguments
[40:47] don't
[40:48] stand look read the human soul and our
[40:50] soul together then Jesus wouldn't have
[40:52] had to Die the animal sacrifice would
[40:55] have been sufficient
[40:57] if it
[40:58] [Applause]
[41:00] just you know in everybody's Soul then
[41:03] the animal sacrifice would have been
[41:05] sufficient because the animal would be
[41:07] breathing there need to be a
[41:10] soul where it says AR the scripture if
[41:12] you notice it says and all of the souls
[41:15] in the sea died or he gave up the souls
[41:18] that were in the sea or something well
[41:20] now what that means is they got this
[41:22] little place made down here no it's just
[41:25] meaning animal life
[41:28] right the animals in
[41:30] there but an animal down in the ocean
[41:32] don't breathe like we breathe now there
[41:34] is animals that has to come up to
[41:36] breathe and go back down okay but now
[41:38] follow me all right he said brother now
[41:42] the argument don't
[41:43] stand look but what God did he breathed
[41:48] the breath of eternal
[41:53] life now listen he amen he became a
[41:58] living
[41:59] Soul a soul that can't
[42:02] die he's talking about Adam right go
[42:06] we'll call his name in a minute he'll
[42:07] read his name in a minute watch now
[42:10] watch we're going to get into honey
[42:12] plumet elbows breathe the breath of
[42:15] eternal life into his nostrils and he
[42:17] became an eternal
[42:20] soul Who's it talking about
[42:22] Adam now watch because God breathe not
[42:26] what nature done but what God did God
[42:30] breathed the breath of life into his
[42:31] nostrils and he became a living soul and
[42:34] you say to me Adam died brother
[42:38] brandom watch you but remember before he
[42:41] died he had a lamb that redeemed him all
[42:45] right those who he fornew is called he
[42:50] got a lamb to redeem him he was a type
[42:52] Adam
[42:53] fell then the lamb was provided for ad
[42:56] Adam watch because already in his
[42:59] nostrils had become the
[43:02] breath of the Eternal
[43:05] God already in Adam's
[43:08] nostrils when he breathed the Breath of
[43:10] Life what he done he put to Genesis 126
[43:12] man over into the 27 man right he put
[43:17] the spiritual man over into the physical
[43:20] man and remember he started in full
[43:22] grown now keep that in your mind watch
[43:26] because already in his nostrils had
[43:27] become the breath of Eternal of the
[43:29] Eternal God so how could God let Adam
[43:34] fall
[43:36] right so you're going to redeem
[43:39] him okay and he become a living Soul he
[43:42] was a Son of God not his breath as the
[43:45] African word I don't know what the Greek
[43:47] word is for right now but the African
[43:49] word they call it amoya which means the
[43:52] wind are an unseen Force animals breathe
[43:54] amoya Sinners breathe the Moya then why
[43:57] would we
[43:59] struggle for eternal life if that's the
[44:03] Eternal Soul breathe into us by
[44:07] breath why would we try why would we
[44:10] struggle for it why would we struggle
[44:12] for eternal life it backs fars brother
[44:15] it just can't do but God
[44:20] specifically upon
[44:22] Adam especially excuse me especially
[44:25] upon Adam
[44:26] breathed the breath of eternal life and
[44:28] he became an eternal person with God he
[44:31] took the 126 man and put him in the
[44:36] two7
[44:39] right remember Eve was in Adam in 27
[44:44] right that we've done cover Eve was in
[44:47] Adam in
[44:50] 126 right amen come on
[44:54] now look he had power
[44:56] was God he was an amateur God he was God
[45:00] of the earth not God of the heaven watch
[45:03] now God of the earth and someday the
[45:06] sons of God will have again become
[45:10] Gods am Jesus said so is not it written
[45:14] into your law you're gods and if you can
[45:17] call these who be called God who God
[45:21] visited how can you condemn me saying
[45:24] when I say I'm the Son of God now we're
[45:28] getting into something deep now watch
[45:31] this when we drive it on
[45:33] down go
[45:38] ahead think about it
[45:42] now especially into
[45:47] Adam and he become a living
[45:50] Soul he's not talking about the rest of
[45:52] us because as I said he made man not a
[45:58] man but he didn't make man all of us
[46:01] with this form or
[46:03] ability some people will never have
[46:06] eternal life
[46:08] right right right so now listen to what
[46:14] I'm
[46:15] saying and you'll get the point of what
[46:17] I keep driving
[46:19] at so God
[46:22] puts the 126 man
[46:27] into the 27 right
[46:30] right he puts the spiritual man into the
[46:34] physical
[46:36] body now you tell me that's not exactly
[46:39] what he done with has done with the new
[46:40] birth right
[46:44] amen the new birth puts the spiritual
[46:47] man the eternal life that the offy of
[46:50] God the
[46:52] Eternal
[46:54] into you and
[46:58] I then we become a living
[47:02] soul but he began Adam as a living Soul
[47:05] everything after
[47:07] then we just get
[47:09] life permitted to prophit L let's see uh
[47:14] and knoweth it not I'm pretty sure he
[47:16] said he
[47:18] permitted us to be
[47:20] born the way we were
[47:23] born he didn't make us to do but he
[47:25] permitted it cuz he had to bring into
[47:27] natural people but look what he goes to
[47:29] questions and answers in 62 527 just to
[47:32] cure the thought
[47:34] on God created the whales and the Sea he
[47:37] done everything and made the creation
[47:40] made man in his own image man not a
[47:45] man whole
[47:47] man all of them in his own image he
[47:51] didn't do
[47:53] that he didn't make all of Man In His
[47:55] Image image follow him see you're
[47:58] reading scan over fice you just read all
[48:00] of them in His image you see everybody's
[48:02] In His Image
[48:04] no only those who have eternal life
[48:11] today in their soul are in the image of
[48:14] God right if nothing else we're brute
[48:18] beasts made to be
[48:22] destroyed
[48:24] right amen
[48:26] but the children of
[48:28] God have eternal life so he didn't make
[48:32] just all man with eternal life in God's
[48:35] image
[48:37] sure we know the message I preached it
[48:39] to you even in man's a fallen
[48:44] estate he's close to the image of
[48:48] God but
[48:51] remember image means exact likeness
[48:57] everybody don't have eternal life that's
[49:00] what I'm want to drive
[49:01] down only Adam received eternal life in
[49:05] his soul because when sin entered the
[49:07] picture nobody else could come with
[49:09] eternal life because you would have an
[49:12] eternal
[49:13] sinner
[49:15] sensible right you don't have eternal
[49:19] Sinners so everything after adamy begin
[49:22] him full grown now watch that in a
[49:24] minute
[49:28] and let's see if we can come the same
[49:29] way but look what he says Made man his
[49:33] own image made man not a man whole man
[49:37] all of them in his own image so you
[49:38] didn't do
[49:40] that he so well you're reading that one
[49:42] way I'm reading it the other way well
[49:44] you read it the other way and let's see
[49:46] what you
[49:51] got come on you read it in your language
[49:53] what you got
[49:56] you got an all man born with eternal
[50:03] life now you got the people of the
[50:06] message running
[50:09] into and even they don't agree I've
[50:12] never heard anybody agree that all men
[50:15] come with eternal life have you I mean
[50:18] always has got to bride the little
[50:21] select group they never cover all man
[50:26] with eternal
[50:30] life so then back up and read it
[50:33] again read it from your
[50:37] revelation God
[50:39] took the Genesis 116 man which was
[50:43] eternal amen or eternal life he put it
[50:47] into Genesis
[50:49] 2 and Adam became a living Soul
[50:53] right when God G gives you and I the new
[50:59] birth our soul becomes
[51:04] Eternal why because the Genesis 1 126
[51:07] Man part that you was to be brother
[51:11] dick is put into to you at the new
[51:15] birth not born into you
[51:19] naturally if it's Born Into You
[51:21] naturally then everybody's saved we just
[51:24] all go into heaven let's have a good
[51:25] time no no no no no they don't fit the
[51:29] Redemption how can you
[51:33] redeem you don't talk about Redemption
[51:36] if everybody's
[51:38] saved you remember Jehovah Witness
[51:41] Doctrine the devil wanted to save
[51:44] everybody so that must be his
[51:47] Doctrine right but are you listening
[51:51] Blasphemous
[51:52] names tells us Mormons excuse
[51:59] me Adam was the only one that received
[52:03] eternal
[52:05] life and remember that even at the time
[52:08] Adam received eternal life Eve was not
[52:11] in
[52:13] existence you know
[52:15] physically she was in Adam amen she had
[52:19] to be removed from Adam and then she was
[52:22] still in theophany
[52:23] remember and wasn't complete because
[52:26] part of him was still in the you
[52:28] remember all the
[52:30] quotes now we're looking at that man
[52:33] being put into flesh Eve's in that man
[52:36] but her soul is still in God because it
[52:38] had been brought into being as
[52:41] Eve remember it wasn't brought into
[52:44] beginning as Eve either right Eve is the
[52:47] Fallen
[52:49] name her name was not Eve it was
[52:54] woman her her name was
[52:57] Adam come on Eve's name was not Eve
[53:01] until the fall when she become to fall
[53:03] it says then she's the mother of all
[53:07] living her name was
[53:09] Adam right
[53:13] okay our name is Miss
[53:17] Jesus are we still in the
[53:20] Redemptive her name is not Samuel D you
[53:24] know James col
[53:27] whatever her name is Miss Jesus
[53:33] amen that's why we don't have a name the
[53:37] Bible says the
[53:39] denominations have a name Revelations
[53:42] three or
[53:44] two they have a name that they're living
[53:48] but dead that's right why because it's a
[53:51] Baptist Methodist Presbyterian
[53:54] bromite
[53:56] Lula HUD the ites whatever you want to
[53:59] make them long you got the ey on the end
[54:01] of we messed
[54:03] up Israel was fine until they become
[54:08] Israelites but are you following
[54:11] me into Adam we read from Blasphemous 9
[54:15] especially into
[54:16] Adam he breathed eternal life so he
[54:21] never breeded into any other
[54:24] mankind
[54:29] I'm going to say this and then I'll have
[54:30] to hold it for a second one day there
[54:34] was a little body
[54:38] born that was a
[54:40] creation and had a
[54:44] beginning and that little baby stepped
[54:47] forth from its
[54:49] mother and when it
[54:51] did he breathed the Breath of Life
[54:57] into
[55:00] Jesus and he became an eternal living
[55:03] Soul amen
[55:07] right
[55:09] right so you see what we're going to
[55:11] right go ahead with the next what we
[55:15] got and then lost my count of where
[55:18] we're at oh we're already on 13 man
[55:20] we're doing good with life and about all
[55:23] of these add-ons and things
[55:25] but
[55:29] listen think about
[55:32] it think about what he's
[55:39] done so then the man
[55:46] Adam the man
[55:50] Adam was a beginning you know an
[55:54] example
[55:56] cuz God begins all of his Creations as
[55:58] full
[56:01] grown now you watch because you say but
[56:03] now wait a minute Jesus
[56:07] become Jesus was an
[56:09] example of you and I that would start as
[56:12] a
[56:13] baby and that's why the Bible says we
[56:16] receive the earnest of our
[56:20] inheritance right which is eternal life
[56:25] all right so he would have to be the
[56:26] example child to come as a baby and grow
[56:30] up to full grown but when he become full
[56:33] grown he was
[56:36] recognized
[56:38] right so it brought it into a condition
[56:40] existence that you and I can dwell in
[56:43] but I want you to think about
[56:48] it if Adam was the example
[56:53] son
[56:55] then all of God's children will follow
[56:59] the example of
[57:03] Adam you go with
[57:06] me we follow the example of Adam because
[57:10] even
[57:11] Jesus would be following the example of
[57:14] Adam as we've
[57:15] covered that God could breathe into that
[57:18] little
[57:19] baby when he was born from
[57:22] Mary the breath of eternal life he
[57:26] didn't have to receive eternal life
[57:28] later he was given it as a baby Adam was
[57:32] a full grown
[57:34] man because God would begin his creation
[57:37] that way he wasn't a baby that growed up
[57:41] and then God breathed into his nostrils
[57:43] Adam started it
[57:46] off okay let's read something here then
[57:50] this is also from Blasphemous names
[57:53] paragraph 23
[57:57] 32 the church is a mystical Body of
[58:01] Christ born of the Breath of
[58:07] God oh did you get
[58:09] it did you get it the congregation is
[58:12] supposed to say
[58:17] Amen the Church of God is
[58:20] born of the Breath of
[58:23] God
[58:26] right so now we're fixing to come into
[58:28] being just like Adam came into
[58:33] being on the day of
[58:36] Pentecost the Holy Ghost came the soul
[58:39] of God right right divided among the
[58:42] people so on the day of Pentecost he put
[58:44] into to the
[58:49] church come
[58:51] on the part that they was to be
[58:55] we call him Peter James
[58:59] John but he calls him his
[59:03] offspring and remember the 120 in the
[59:05] upper room were
[59:09] already not what would be called capped
[59:12] off headstone
[59:13] people but they had three and A2 years
[59:15] of training so they wouldn't little
[59:17] bitty
[59:19] babies he's going to start his church
[59:22] off the same way he started Adam
[59:25] Off full
[59:27] grown okay now brother uh if I quote
[59:32] this wrong I get it um
[59:35] brother Henry green I believe now if I
[59:38] miss it forgive me he quoted brother
[59:41] brandham as saying one time and I wasn't
[59:43] there and heard it but I've heard people
[59:45] say he said
[59:46] it that God started his church off the
[59:49] way he wanted
[59:53] it he wants the
[59:56] church to be the way he started it I can
[1:00:01] see
[1:00:03] that right he wants you and I to be the
[1:00:06] way the church
[1:00:07] started he started it the way he wanted
[1:00:10] it and he wants us to be what he started
[1:00:13] in the
[1:00:15] manifestation great wonderful
[1:00:16] opportunity in this last days so the
[1:00:19] church is a mystical Body of Christ born
[1:00:22] to the Breath of God a Church of God is
[1:00:25] born to the Breath of
[1:00:26] God God breathed into the nostrils
[1:00:31] spiritually of Adam I read and he become
[1:00:35] a living
[1:00:36] Soul did you know the Pentecostal or the
[1:00:39] true Pentecostal church is born of the
[1:00:43] Breath of
[1:00:45] God right you don't have to pull up the
[1:00:49] just run it on up brother Rich because
[1:00:50] you don't have to pull up John cuz we
[1:00:52] had John but leave it leave it down just
[1:00:54] a little all right cuz this is John
[1:00:59] 20 you know that where he says this at
[1:01:02] cuz you can read John 20 if you want to
[1:01:04] because this is where it said it let me
[1:01:06] read you something just a minute that's
[1:01:07] on it let me see just a minute St John I
[1:01:10] believe where I'm going to we'll find
[1:01:11] out whether the Church of where the
[1:01:14] Church of God is or
[1:01:16] not in other words where it's born to
[1:01:18] the Breath of God or Not St John let's
[1:01:20] see I believe that's about 1619 which is
[1:01:24] really
[1:01:25] uh John
[1:01:26] 2022 right there is where you begin all
[1:01:29] right here I believe we'll have it right
[1:01:31] here all right let me read you and see
[1:01:33] whether the church is born to the Breath
[1:01:35] of God or
[1:01:38] not like Adam was in the
[1:01:41] beginning so you and I are going to have
[1:01:43] to be born or come forth like Adam
[1:01:47] did or we're not the
[1:01:50] church okay follow
[1:01:53] it and the same day at evening he starts
[1:01:56] quoting the scripture being the first
[1:01:57] day of the week when the doors were shut
[1:01:59] and the disciples were assembled for
[1:02:01] fear of the Jews Jesus came and stood in
[1:02:04] the midst of them and said unto them
[1:02:07] peace be unto you now this is after the
[1:02:13] resurrection of the Lord Jesus
[1:02:17] amen
[1:02:19] right if I can read it this is after the
[1:02:21] resurrection of the Lord
[1:02:23] Jesus this is not while he was in the
[1:02:25] life with
[1:02:26] him amen this is after his resurrection
[1:02:30] okay look what he said he said unto them
[1:02:33] he showed them his hands and his side
[1:02:36] then were the disciples glad when they
[1:02:38] saw the Lord and Jesus and then Jesus
[1:02:41] said unto them peace be unto you as my
[1:02:44] father has sent me so send I
[1:02:48] you now what did the prophet say that
[1:02:50] that
[1:02:51] meant he said God came came down and
[1:02:55] went in Jesus he said that's the way God
[1:02:58] and Jesus was the
[1:02:59] same right he said how does he send his
[1:03:02] church he comes down and goes in his
[1:03:04] church making her and him one right okay
[1:03:09] now watch the father that sent him went
[1:03:12] in him and Jesus when he descends as
[1:03:14] disciple he goes in him same one sent
[1:03:17] God and when he said un said this he
[1:03:21] breathed on them and said receive ye the
[1:03:23] Holy Ghost
[1:03:27] amen now watch it Church born to the
[1:03:30] Breath of
[1:03:33] God now you better notice where he puts
[1:03:35] it to
[1:03:40] right because you remember
[1:03:42] [Music]
[1:03:43] now when the Holy Ghost fell on the
[1:03:45] church at
[1:03:47] Pentecost it fell on tutored Sons and
[1:03:50] Daughters of God brother random
[1:03:52] according to Statue of perfect man
[1:03:55] he said the holy ghost that fell on on
[1:03:57] Pentecost put them at brotherly
[1:04:03] kindness right okay but said when we
[1:04:07] Reed the new birth we start at
[1:04:12] Faith why because they were tuted and
[1:04:14] trained for three and a half years right
[1:04:17] so he started his church full
[1:04:19] grown right right when he breathed on
[1:04:23] the upper room people was full
[1:04:27] grown now let me give you an example
[1:04:30] because of the rest of what I'm
[1:04:32] doing
[1:04:34] uh was all 120 with him when he breathed
[1:04:38] on them and said receive you the Holy
[1:04:41] Ghost I don't know whether they would or
[1:04:43] not probably
[1:04:48] wouldn't but that didn't make no
[1:04:53] difference but what if he's talking to
[1:04:55] 3,000
[1:04:58] people and he breathed on him and said
[1:05:01] receive you the Holy
[1:05:05] Ghost you see where you got to have a
[1:05:07] revelation to follow
[1:05:09] things because only the 120 in the upper
[1:05:12] room would have the capability of
[1:05:15] standing amen at brotherly
[1:05:17] kindness rest of them couldn't stand
[1:05:19] there it didn't mean that God didn't
[1:05:22] speak to
[1:05:23] them
[1:05:25] but it meant a
[1:05:27] difference like I've always said the
[1:05:29] Bible said that Jesus after his
[1:05:31] resurrection read your scripture was
[1:05:34] seen of over 500 Brethren right not
[1:05:38] called them
[1:05:39] Brethren and they could have come on and
[1:05:42] become
[1:05:44] Christians but how come 120 is all that
[1:05:46] made it to the upper
[1:05:51] room okay and when do we get to the next
[1:05:55] part where we'll read what brother Brown
[1:05:57] says this
[1:05:59] means so just follow with me Church born
[1:06:03] to the Breath of God when this stature
[1:06:05] has molded itself up there in
[1:06:10] condition
[1:06:13] right this is what the disciples had in
[1:06:16] the upper room Holy Spirit they didn't
[1:06:18] have the headstone brother run said they
[1:06:21] didn't you when they had a portion
[1:06:24] don't go into all of that just say what
[1:06:26] he
[1:06:29] says they didn't have the headstone cuz
[1:06:31] he said The Headstone hadn't come yet
[1:06:34] amen he said it was to come in the last
[1:06:37] days what when the church is molded up
[1:06:39] into the
[1:06:42] condition all right so Follow Me
[1:06:44] Now Church born to the Breath of God
[1:06:47] when there stature has molded itself up
[1:06:49] there in condition God's Breeze breath
[1:06:51] upon them receive receive the Holy Ghost
[1:06:55] then you are a son of God you can join
[1:06:58] anything you want
[1:07:00] to I love that you may not like that to
[1:07:04] a lot of people you know what they said
[1:07:06] brother brandom say it you telling me to
[1:07:09] come out of them denomination brother
[1:07:11] Brandon said I can join anything I want
[1:07:14] to that's
[1:07:18] right that's what he said
[1:07:22] right you got his word
[1:07:26] words but see you failed to listen to
[1:07:28] the
[1:07:30] others where he said go ahead and stay
[1:07:33] there he said let your light shine and
[1:07:35] they'll throw you
[1:07:38] out so evidently a lot of people ain't
[1:07:40] been letting their light shine they
[1:07:42] still
[1:07:44] there I say brother
[1:07:48] Dale in the end time
[1:07:51] message go ahead and run with all these
[1:07:54] churches you want
[1:07:57] to you know believe this two Souls Two
[1:07:59] Lord 700 this
[1:08:01] presid but let your light
[1:08:04] shine and you'll find out you won't be
[1:08:07] there
[1:08:10] long right I was not throw out of the
[1:08:13] Baptist
[1:08:16] Church they wanted me to
[1:08:22] stay
[1:08:24] but I've been thrown out of this
[1:08:28] message the only two churches I've been
[1:08:31] in since I've been got thr out of
[1:08:33] them not because I fussed and argued
[1:08:36] with the
[1:08:37] pastor but it's because I didn't agree
[1:08:39] with
[1:08:41] him so you see that's just personal
[1:08:46] okay he
[1:08:48] says molded himself up there in
[1:08:50] condition God breathes breath upon them
[1:08:53] receive ye the holy Holy Ghost and
[1:08:54] you're a Son of God you can join
[1:08:55] anything you want to but you're born
[1:08:57] into the Church of the Living God born
[1:08:59] by the Breath of God God breathed upon
[1:09:02] them and said receive ye the holy
[1:09:04] receive ye we the holy ghost oh my there
[1:09:06] you are and he talks about coming up
[1:09:09] with the soup suppers and going all the
[1:09:11] time but when you become a child of God
[1:09:14] you are born by the Breath of God Amen
[1:09:17] better leave it alone right there now
[1:09:19] all
[1:09:21] right so the disciples come right here
[1:09:26] and we're born again right there where
[1:09:28] it says holy spirit born by the Breath
[1:09:30] of
[1:09:31] God when we come into the body of Christ
[1:09:34] we come into the body of Christ at
[1:09:36] Faith being the earnest of our
[1:09:39] inheritance but you're still born by the
[1:09:41] Breath of
[1:09:42] God you're just not molded in
[1:09:46] stature the new birth is the new birth
[1:09:49] it's the Breath of God when you receive
[1:09:52] eternal life right here at at Faith you
[1:09:54] don't have to grow all the way up here
[1:09:55] to get eternal
[1:09:58] life that's the difference in the day of
[1:10:01] Pentecost it like it took years to
[1:10:04] express and explain on the day of
[1:10:06] Pentecost the 120 were right here only
[1:10:09] the spirit but the next message
[1:10:14] outside they were born again at Faith
[1:10:17] cuz they never heard the
[1:10:19] message but yet they were born
[1:10:22] babies but the disciples wouldn't born
[1:10:27] babies that's why none of those babies
[1:10:29] of the 3000 was chose to write the
[1:10:35] word
[1:10:36] right Apostle Paul was the only one that
[1:10:39] wouldn't have of the room of the ones
[1:10:41] that was
[1:10:43] chosen because God don't trust his word
[1:10:46] with a
[1:10:48] novice okay Church born by the Breath of
[1:10:51] God like Adam was
[1:10:55] was especially into Adam he gave him he
[1:10:59] took the 126 man he put it into Adam
[1:11:03] amen Adam was a full grown
[1:11:06] man on the church on the day of
[1:11:11] Pentecost he took the 126
[1:11:14] man and put it
[1:11:17] into the church on the day of
[1:11:20] Pentecost Peter James John Etc
[1:11:24] breathed upon them before
[1:11:27] he remembers after his
[1:11:30] resurrection I pull up the last quote
[1:11:32] and then we'll
[1:11:34] quit look what he
[1:11:36] says what about this brother
[1:11:40] Dale did they receive the Holy Ghost so
[1:11:43] that be a good Doctrine wouldn't
[1:11:45] it be a good Doctrine in these end time
[1:11:49] people that believe you come into the
[1:11:51] world with eternal life and always was
[1:11:53] was eternal doctrines and two Souls Two
[1:11:56] Lords and all kind of
[1:11:59] things and they'd say see th he breathed
[1:12:02] on them and said receive you the Holy
[1:12:04] Ghost now you just destroyed your own
[1:12:08] Doctrine that's mean I know
[1:12:11] it see when you say he breathed on them
[1:12:14] and said receive you the Holy Ghost it
[1:12:17] evidently meant he didn't have it before
[1:12:20] then so if he was even going to use that
[1:12:23] you'd be in bad
[1:12:26] shape
[1:12:28] right did they get to Holy Ghost the day
[1:12:30] Jesus breathed on
[1:12:34] him brother

[1:12:48] brandom what is the difference between
[1:12:51] when Jesus breathed on the disciples and
[1:12:53] said receive you the Holy Ghost and when
[1:12:56] they when they had to go to the upper
[1:12:58] room to T what's the difference brother
[1:13:02] BR it was a
[1:13:04] promise he gave
[1:13:07] them he never gave them the holy ghost
[1:13:09] that
[1:13:11] day the day he breathed on him he never
[1:13:14] gave him the Holy Ghost read it it was a
[1:13:18] promise he gave them breathed upon them
[1:13:21] his promise and said receive the Holy
[1:13:23] Ghost it was a promise they went to the
[1:13:27] upper room to wait for the promise to be
[1:13:30] fulfilled
[1:13:32] amen
[1:13:35] right now folks what have we been doing
[1:13:38] 40
[1:13:38] [Music]
[1:13:43] years we believe we have eternal life by
[1:13:45] the new
[1:13:47] birth as I
[1:13:50] said Upper Room experience was 120 of
[1:13:53] have been tutored and that put them
[1:13:56] where it says holy spirit on the pyramid
[1:13:59] the 3,000 that come later started as
[1:14:03] babies you know why because Jesus
[1:14:07] started as a
[1:14:09] baby
[1:14:12] right you ever heard brother randam said
[1:14:14] he was an example to everybody he said
[1:14:17] he was a baby to the babies he said he
[1:14:20] was a teenager to the
[1:14:22] teenagers
[1:14:24] right he said he was an adult to the
[1:14:27] adults you haven't heard him say that if
[1:14:29] you need it
[1:14:32] call he was example of all
[1:14:37] things he received eternal
[1:14:41] life as an example as a baby just like
[1:14:45] you and I receive eternal life when
[1:14:47] we're first born again you know what
[1:14:50] happens then God puts the 126 man into
[1:14:54] the two into the
[1:14:56] 27 you know amen when you receive
[1:14:59] eternal life by the new
[1:15:03] birth that is the 126
[1:15:06] man cuz that's only one man the man
[1:15:10] Christ
[1:15:12] Jesus amen all
[1:15:14] right then he puts that man when you
[1:15:18] receive the new birth into you in baby
[1:15:21] form and I baby form
[1:15:23] m a growth
[1:15:26] development
[1:15:29] begins and we start up the stature of a
[1:15:31] perfect
[1:15:32] man and when this image is formed into
[1:15:41] being when that image back there that
[1:15:43] man Christ
[1:15:46] Jesus when he come into
[1:15:49] maturity God spoke from heaven and said
[1:15:53] this is my beloved Son in whom I'm
[1:15:56] pleased to
[1:15:57] dwell right
[1:15:59] right and when the finish of his
[1:16:01] ministry for three and A2
[1:16:04] years he grew in Grace and knowledge the
[1:16:07] Bible
[1:16:09] says and then in Matthew about 17 it
[1:16:12] says another time happens this time that
[1:16:15] time he was out in the public this time
[1:16:18] he was drawn away that only Peter James
[1:16:20] and John saw it and he was taken up
[1:16:23] right and he said this is my beloved Son
[1:16:27] in whom I'm pleased to
[1:16:28] dwell hear you him he
[1:16:32] adopted his own son into the
[1:16:35] family when you and I come to the
[1:16:37] position Church of being
[1:16:41] adopted and that's what's going to bring
[1:16:43] to
[1:16:45] pass the Rapture is an adoption of the
[1:16:49] Bride of Jesus
[1:16:51] Christ all right right not because we
[1:16:54] believe the message or shout Glory
[1:16:56] Hallelujah that's
[1:16:59] right it's when God has seen his own
[1:17:02] life in you and I he will adopt his own
[1:17:07] life he don't adopt an immature son
[1:17:13] right and he only adopts those who have
[1:17:15] stood the training
[1:17:17] tutoring and become into the
[1:17:20] manifestation that supposed to be
[1:17:24] Romans 8 says the world is waiting for
[1:17:26] the manifestation of the sons of
[1:17:31] God waiting on you and
[1:17:35] I God gave us a new birth he breath into
[1:17:39] our nostrils put the 126 man into us
[1:17:43] right but we got to grow up amen right
[1:17:50] right
[1:17:52] right grow up into him the scripture
[1:17:56] says and then he can breathe upon you
[1:17:59] and adopt
[1:18:01] you same way
[1:18:06] Jesus you see Adam started full grown so
[1:18:09] he didn't have to come up and be
[1:18:14] adopted right the church came on a day
[1:18:17] of Pentecost and full
[1:18:20] grown they couldn't make it up to
[1:18:24] adoption why cuz you and I wouldn't
[1:18:27] there is that
[1:18:30] sensible and neither was the full word
[1:18:33] to come for
[1:18:37] Redemption born by the Breath of
[1:18:42] God he breathed on
[1:18:45] us and we become a living
[1:18:48] Soul you may be 10 years old 20 years
[1:18:51] old 70 years old 80 years old but when
[1:18:54] you're born again God breathes into your
[1:18:57] nostrils eternal life he puts that 126
[1:19:01] man that you and I to be into this human
[1:19:09] flesh and we become God's
[1:19:12] Offspring I don't see what's so
[1:19:14] secretive or mystery or deep
[1:19:18] things when it's so
[1:19:21] simple that it ties together every
[1:19:24] scripture in the
[1:19:29] Bible but yet are we like one man told
[1:19:31] me one time or was in my presence he
[1:19:34] said that uh that adoption is
[1:19:38] simple he said that statue of perfect
[1:19:40] man is
[1:19:45] confusing I thr on
[1:19:48] God that's my
[1:19:51] pastor
[1:19:56] that's what I thought that's my
[1:19:59] pastor can I go any further than
[1:20:03] that no while I'm
[1:20:09] here because adoption and stature of
[1:20:12] perfect man is the same
[1:20:15] thing
[1:20:17] right but yet to him one of them was
[1:20:19] simple and one of them was
[1:20:21] deep
[1:20:27] you see why it's always a climbing
[1:20:29] coming out of and in
[1:20:33] to if you find any place any further
[1:20:37] advanced in what word is being preached
[1:20:39] and you have here let me know we'll be
[1:20:42] there the next Sunday I'll pay
[1:20:44] everybody's
[1:20:46] way and we'll
[1:20:49] see what that
[1:20:51] is
[1:20:53] you tell me any preacher that preaches
[1:20:55] any greater than thoughts and I'm not
[1:20:58] saying I'm the top get it off
[1:21:02] yet I'm saying if you know of anything
[1:21:04] can help us let me know I'll be glad to
[1:21:07] call them and fly them in from West
[1:21:09] Africa India China or the
[1:21:14] moon if it takes
[1:21:18] it because I want us
[1:21:21] helped
[1:21:28] what you see if people can
[1:21:30] take that Jesus breathed on them and
[1:21:32] they become a living soul and Jehovah
[1:21:35] Witness and make that the soul of man
[1:21:37] just be in the hour you
[1:21:41] breathe let's be careful of the
[1:21:43] doctrines we
[1:21:46] hear
[1:21:48] right let's be thankful for the truth
[1:21:50] and to do the best we can let's stand
[1:21:52] we're going into the
[1:21:58] communion go ahead brothers
[1:22:01] and
