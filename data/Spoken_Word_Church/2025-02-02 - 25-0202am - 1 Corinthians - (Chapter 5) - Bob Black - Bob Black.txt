TRANSCRIPT
========================================
attention three stages to that Journey three stages to this journey right here let's bow our heads as we prepare to go into the study Lord God we're so grateful for your goodness to us so grateful for the word that you've given us to take us into that promised land that the prophet was speaking of we ask Lord that you just bless our study today bless the service Lord help us Lord Jesus as we dive into these things that you'll guide us and through this through these scriptures and Quicken it to Lord to give us understanding we pray in your name amen now we're going to we're getting into 1 Corinthians chapter 5 which is uh some some real meat and potatoes and uh so just to kind of do a little transition we'll close out the the chapter 4 and and where Paul's saying I'll read these words for though we have you have 10,000 instructors in Christ yet have ye not many fathers for in Christ Jesus I have begotten gotten you through the gospel wherefore I beseech you be followers of me so Paul's exhorting everyone to to look at the example that he's laid out of he's laid out in his life of of of humility and obedience to Christ but it's pointing the way to Christ and so that's what Paul is is is really laying out here that our our our ultimate example is Christ and any Minister any any any uh Church age messenger that's preaching the word they're not pointing the way to themselves although they themselves can be an example in the word they preaching it's all the ultimate goal is to point to Christ as our example so in in uh in chapter 4:1 17 he says for this cause have I sent unto you Timothy who is my beloved Son and faithful in the Lord who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ as I teach everywhere in every church and now I I I I love the way that Paul uses this phrase puffed up and now we're getting into some some character traits how how we how we are now and and now look when you get into chapter five look at we'll examine why why they're puffed up it's it's so interesting to look at the character of of people and how we do and how we how we react to situations he's he's fixing to he's fixing to get on them and he's saying now now some are puffed up as though I would not come to you puffed up all built up in their s like Paul ain't going to come to us and could you you think how you know we we in our Humanity sometimes we we get all upset with somebody for for for no particular reason because we we we think you know we think we're they're getting upset at Paul the church age messenger because because of all these reasons that they got built up within themselves but he said but I've come to you shortly if the Lord will and will know not the speech of them which are puffed up but the power in other words you might be able to say a lot of things but let me see if you're actually manifesting the word of God when I come when I come to you I want to see if you're actually living the word or or if it's just a lot of vain speech for the kingdom of God is not in word now that's well well I thought we were supposed to be about the word but but it's it's got to be lived it's not just something where you you're you're you're telling you know all these saying all these things and and and and harassing one another and so forth and being puffed up but in power what will you shall come unto you with a rod or in love and in the spirit of meekness so he's given them the choice you can decide in what Manner I'm going to come into you with a rod where I'm going to kind of tear the hide off of you or or in love and corrective and peace and meekness to to to bring peace and and restoration and those kind of things now look at what he's he's framing up as we go into chapter 5 that these people are they've got they've got somebody that's living in fornication and rather than humbling themselves and and that that they're act they're actually endorsing that deviant lifestyle and and Paul's framing it up like you you're living you got somebody living in a way that a lot of the world don't even live but instead of uh uh instead of responding in humility and meekness your response is actually to be puffed up now you tell me that ain't the human condition that a lot of times when our when our our own lives and things are not going right and and whatnot we we respond in the wrong way respond get all puffed up like this like a like a little we get all we we get all bent out of shape over things and and and where our own house is is burning down but we get all burnt puffed up so in verse in chapter 5 Paul talks this is how he's framing it up to him it's reported commonly that there is for fornication among you and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles now y'all remember that we framed up Corinth was was a a little Heathen town where they actually as part of their worship they would go to that Temple of of uh I forget the god the Goddess that they worship but um they they they would actually worship and by by committing fornication and things and and so he's saying this what you're doing here is something that even the world the heathens don't even do but you are defending this person right and what what's he framing up here that that when when you see sin in your life or in your church or whatever don't endorse it because that's our tendency is to baby baby sin and and pet the devil and well we just got to love them and everything but love is going to be corrective love is not going to endure something that's wrong it it's it's going to take a stand for something you you you see you know you see young people smoking pot or something and you you well we got to pour on the love well don't forget to be corrective you got to take a stand and and that's what Paul's saying is is uh he said you're ye are puffed up and have not rather mourned that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you so look as we read the rest of this chapter he's he's he's telling them look you're you're still fellowshipping with this person and you're you're treating them as though there's nothing wrong it it's just all good and this person is is is uh doing things that are terrible and so now this this is the human condition that we're talking about that your house would be burning down and you will react to the minister preaching the word as as though the it's The Minister's fault you react to someone that's laying the word out or or or telling you some good advice would get all puffed up well you can't tell me and in the meanwhile it's your own house per the Corinthians Church's house was burning down and they're getting all upset at Paul I got a little bird in a tree that's burn burning down and and that's that's the reaction the Corinthians now being puffed up means it's it's referring to your a state of arrogance and self-exaltation I know more than Paul I I Paul ain't even going to come see see us it's a condition in which a person becomes so overly confident in their own views abilities or achievements to the point of ignoring or rejecting correction from God or others a and so it's the opposite of being humble and receptive and that kind of self exaltation that kind of a a stance or character trait is is going to be just a huge hindrance because it prevents you from really receiving and internalizing God's word instead instead of letting the word of God take a hold of your life and and change you your your reaction is well bless God I know and that that person ain't going to tell me and so when when when you get puffed up they're more concerned about their own opinions and how much they know and their their own background and so and their self-image self-image that's that's the thing that gets us well I I don't want nothing to to hinder what other people think about my self-image I I ain't going raise my hand or I'm not going to say Amen because I don't know want anybody to to to to look at my position or whatever but that's why the the scripture says that God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble being puffed up not only stops the Holy Spirit from working effectively within the individual but it also disrupts the unity and edification of the church as a whole CU you could you imagine if if like everybody in the church was puffed up that that would that would be uh that would be a nightmare that's what that little Corinthian Church was that that everything's burning down around them and and look what the state what they're in they're defending they're defending what what what a nightmare defending somebody living in sin living in fornication he and now think now this is we'll Frame It Up kind of funny this is like one of those talk shows where you you you got some kind of a horrible scenario coming out a man and his wife and then that the man's son is actually sleeping with the the his dad's step is his stepmother sleeping with his mother's wife and and to for that for a church to look at a scenario like that and say well I'm just going to cover that up it's it's all right but they're they're still going out to the to the uh to McDonald's and you know fellowshipping and and and and having a good old time and sweeping under the rug and they're getting all puffed up about that now you know one person that got real puffed up that Daniel Daniel was explaining in in chapter five of of Daniel to Bel shazar he's talking about his daddy he's like now Bel shashar got all humbled and so Daniel's explaining to him now don't you remember your dad Nebuchadnezzar that that he got all built up in Pride and said well nobody's going to tell me this and that and and God humbled him and and put him out in the in the field and made him eat grass so Daniel's telling him oh Thou King the most high God Gave You Nebuchadnezzar thy father a kingdom and majesty and glory and honor but when his heart was lifted up and his mind hardened in Pride he was deposed from his kingly throne and they took his glory from him now now this kind of goes along with what Paul's trying to express in chapter 5 that when someone gets lifted up in Pride and and and is and is defending the wrong thing or living in sin then what you do you the church can do is turn them over to the devil now we're going to dive into that a little bit turn back in other words back up stop endorsing it back up pull away from it stop endorsing it stop putting your hands around it and saying well well bless God we just got to we got to love this person cuz love sometimes will be just back up and let let the normal let let the devil get a hold and let things progress in a way to where they realize that the devil ain't got nothing good for them let let think like like this is what happened with Nebuchadnezzar he got he got out in the field eating grass living like a wild animal and he began to realize the only thing that could save him was God brother ramman said in the images of Christ he said and this is talking about being puffed up what if there is a cage full of canaries and the cage is the size of this Tabernacle and one little Canary flies up in the cage and says gentlemen I want to tell you all something now now this is speaking of character how how we do now this is I we do like he's saiding what what if there was a cage as big as this whole building this whole Tabernacle and one little Canary is going to get up and say well I bless God I know everything one little Canary flies up in the cage and says gentlemen I want to tell you all something I happen to be just a little Superior to you all you see I'm a canary that knows all about the human being oh I can explain it all I've seen the lady walk through the house I've seen The Children Play I know all about it now you all listen to me and about the time he's pouting off his little brain a Princeton University College man steps up with a polishness of grammar and he begins to carry a conversation with that little Canary brain using the highest grammar that he can and speaking to this little canary bird I'd imagine the little fellow turned his head sideways he would listen from one side to another but he don't know a thing he's talking about yet he can hear him yet he can see him but what does his knowledge amount to nothing because he don't know what the man's talking about why he's got a canary brain he hasn't got a human brain he just understands as canaries understand and that's the way the human is I don't care how intellectual you are we still got Canary brains because we're only human beings now now how we how can we apply this to what Paul's talking about to the Corinthians is that they're looking at it from their little Canary brains standpoint well I don't see there if there's anything wrong with whatever with with this situation but to to really understand things we need God we need a supernatural Revelation so that we can have God will Elevate us from our little Canary brain to where we're looking at things from God's vantage point so we need God and that that puffed up mentality is what gets us in trouble you know brother the Bible even talks about how that you know a a man that uh you know fully loaded down is not going to be rattling uh it it's going to be quiet more quiet and everything but you you have a man that's that's not full up of God and it's going to be making a lot of a lot of noise a lot of commotion as it goes down the road just like a wagon it a a wagon that doesn't have a load is just going to be making a lot of making a lot of noise and and that's the same way that we are sometimes you find the ones that that that are not fully loaded down want to tell everybody and want to be puffed up and want to explain things look what brother Brandon said in a door and the door he said we people out here believe in big things we Americans we want big hats and big Automobiles and big denominations more in the Creed and more in the denomination all we want is big things and God is after small still voices a lot of Racket and noise is what we want a farmer took a wagon one time went down on the field and when he did it bumped and rattled and made a lot of noise when it come back it crossed the same bumps and never even moved it was loaded with good things so we don't want to be puffed up brother R said and why is that so many Christians find so hard to live the Christian Life he said examine ourselves today examine it by the word see is our life ticking off just like that see everything love what's the fruit of it how do you know it's keeping right time it's got love love vth not itself it's not like this this bird of paradise is making a big show it's it's not puffed up it's sociable neighborly loving believing all things hopeing all things love joy peace longsuffering goodness gentleness patience Meek Faith All These Fine qualities is ticking out of that person's life when the holy spirit's in there ticking it around that see that's the that's the worst kind of character trait when you get so built up with within yourself that you can't listen to the word you think that well I I'm the one that has all the the answers I look at all this information that I've got on the internet look at all the studying that I've done and fail to actually humble oursel to listen to what the word says about our life and the way that we're living now so now here's here's getting into the meat and potatoes he said it it's reported that that there is fornication among you now if you want to really dive into this definition just just briefly adultery is the difference between adultery and fornication it's it's it it depends it's looking at the marital Bond at that at that at that vow so adultery is the deliberate betrayal of a marital Bond it's enemy with somebody who is not your spouse but now fornication is any activity outside of the context of your of your marriage so whether it's premarital or extramarital if it's outside of that marital Bond it's expressing an unclean disordered Life In the Flesh I I was looking back through some sermons that brother Dale preached and and he he would really get into how a fornication just Dives right it goes even into uh like the heart condition where you're you're uh you know and I'm I'm going to stay away from that I'm not good but look what Paul's saying he saiding is it's reported commonly there's fornication among you and you are puffed up and have not rather mourned that he that ha done this thing might might be taken away from you for I verely as absent in body but present in spirit have judged already look he's saying I'm not in Corinth I'm I'm hundreds of miles away but I'm still able to judge and tell you that what you're doing is wrong but you there sitting right next to that person are willing to endorse endorse it endorse what hundreds of miles away I'm not willing to endorse I'm judging it as wrong as though I were present concerning them him that ha so done this deed in the name name of our Lord Jesus Christ when you are gathered together in my spirit with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ to deliver such in one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus your glorying is not good know you not that A little leaven lenth the whole lump Purge out therefore the old leaven that you may be a new lump as ye are unleavened for even Christ Our Passover is s sacrificed for us and turn him over to the devil now here's here's the church's the question for the church are we going to endorse it or are we going to throw our arms around it and say well well I I'm just I'm going to back you up or are we going to condemn it brother R in questions and answers on the Holy Ghost he said that's what's the matter with the churches today when a man comes into the body of Christ and becomes one of the members and starts doing evil instead of you all getting together and doing this very same thing and you brandom Tabernacle do that because as long as you're holding him up he's under the blood as long as you're holding it up endorsing it just going along with it well you know I know I know he's living that way but we we're just we're just going to come to church and just just go through the motions anyway and just act like it ain't there and he just keeps doing the same old thing over and over and over all the time you get together and turn him over to the devil for the destruction of the flesh that his spirit is like might be saved in the day of the Lord and watch the whip of God come in watch The Devil take a hold of him that's an evil spirit gets him now isn't that such a interesting thing to study on that it it it would be a good thing to just back up and let let things lay out to bring somebody to a place to where they're like oh God sin took me where I don't want to go I need you that that can actually be love and and you know that that's our problem is that when we see our children doing things wrong you see your kids smoking that weed smoking that joint you see your kids doing something they shouldn't be doing and you endorse it instead of instead of of of getting on your knees and saying God you need to do whatever you need to do to straighten this out but we'll we'll endorse it and Pat them on the back bless him you know do you do you need that iPad do you need you a fancy news something or other and we'll endorse it instead of pulling back and and and letting letting God correct and do what he needs to do now you know sometimes even even little children you know that that that that thing of of pulling back uh sometimes you got to you know you get a little a little kid that that uh they just don't realize that they need to stay away from that fire stay away from that candle but then you'll you all right you you got to learn the hard way and and you just sit you take a step back and you you watch as they reach out that little kid reaches out and touches that candle and and then they learn and and and and it sometimes it takes the hard way for them to learn but turn them over to the devil is when a Believer is persistently living and blatant unrepentant sin the church may be forced to deliver or remove that person from fellowship so that the destruction of the flesh can incur in other words the sinful and carnal part of your their nature is allowed to run its course or or be broken down so that the soul can be saved you see somebody sitting in church and they're they're not living right brother R will say remember Paul what he told them over there this man that wouldn't obey the gospel he said turn him over to the devil for the destruction of his flesh that is soul will be saved that's right now now here's the the thing the kicker is you can't play with God you can't play with you come into church and you expect to say well I'm a Christian I'm a Believer and take communion and then live a hound dog life and that's where the church is just endorsing things and that's where you have a just a mess like the Corinthians did you you can't endorse you can't allow someone to come in living living a hound dog life and then and then just kind of you go by with it being patted on the on the back you can't pet the devil you can't pet the devil you can't allow the devil to get away with with with doing things you can't play with god brother that's that word inspired every word of it lays right straight to the human line that's right you'll either tow the line but if you're ever born of the spirit of God you are a son of God now turn them over to the devil for the destruction of the Flesh and then watch that something begins to take hold just like like um brother Brown I'm going to give examples like brother Ramsey that we'll look at in a moment brother Billy Paul when he the the devil got a hold of him and got him in the hospital bed and then then he was ready to repent and and brother Ram said you did the sin and you do the praying then then you're you're ready you're in a state where your flesh is all broken down and and your your spirit's all in turmoil and you're ready to come back to God the individual is left in the realm of natural consequences without the support of Christian Fellowship that sinful lifestyle will run its course and it often results in severe losses or hard hardships what's that mean without the support of Christian Fellowship that don't mean nobody's nobody's uh talking to you that don't mean that we do like the Amish and put you out or whatever and just dis disassociate from you but but it means that that uh we're not praying uh for maybe the things that you want to be prayed for but we're praying that God will will do something in your life and will will grab a hold of you and begin to mold you and bring you back into the fold and and what it is is not it's not an endorsement it's the purpose is not to abandon the purpose person completely but to remove that enabling environment that might allow sin to flourish now this is really a lesson for us all isn't it because that's our problem problem is we want to we're enablers we want to enable the devil to just run rough shot over us and over our family we'll we'll see our kids uh watching TV shows and things that they shouldn't be and we just enable it we we just we we'll just Pat the devil and let him just do whatever and that's that's what Paul say you can't do that you know uh we we've uh if if the devil if the devil's coming in your house it's time to take a stand and say you got to get out if the devil's coming in your church or whatever and afflicting people it's time to take a stand and say you you can't do that you got to get out I'm trying to find a place to close here this is a big long story brother Ramy I'm I'm not going to read that right now but um I'll read this quote where brother R said in questions and answers and then we'll we'll stop as the musicians come forward he said God telling the holy church which is his body here on Earth that now this is after the holy Old Testament and the new telling a man that was so filthy and dirty amongst the people that he lived with his own father's wife and said such a thing in the body of Christ you Church turn him over to the devil for the destruction see God permits the and when he got something he has to see done to put a whip on somebody he'll turn an evil spirit loose on them so that they'll torment that person and bring them back that's what's the matter with the churches today when a man comes into the body of Christ and becomes one of the members and starts doing evil instead of you all getting together and doing this very same thing and you brandom Tabernacle do that because as long as you're holding him up he's under the blood and he just keeps doing the same old thing over and over and over all the time you get together and turn him over to the devil for the destruction of the flesh that his Spirit might be saved in the day of the Lord and watch the whip of God come in watch The Devil take a hold of him that's a evil spirit guessing God bless you Saints we'll we'll stop right there and we will continue next time [Applause]
