[12:17] straight enough but they gave him a
[12:18] whole bunch of steroids to try to help
[12:20] him and that done worse than it did to

[13:28] Grace and keep us in Lord just bless the
[13:32] little bride around the world and the
[13:33] prophet said one day and it wasn't hard
[13:35] to pray that because that was a promise
[13:37] you made that you'd do and we love you
[13:39] and we thank you in Jesus name
[13:42] amen
[13:43] to Ephesians
[13:45] if you would
[13:48] um you know we're still in studying and
[13:50] I hope you're still reading on the
[13:51] future home going over and over and over
[13:54] it but now if you'll listen or try to to
[13:58] read the message of it's the rising of
[14:01] the sun we'll try to get on more into
[14:03] that show if you have time just listen
[14:06] to that or or read the message it's the
[14:09] rising of the Sun
[14:11] Ephesians 1 verse 3.
[14:14] that should be the garden father of our
[14:16] Lord Jesus Christ who have blessed us
[14:18] with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly
[14:20] places in Christ according as he had
[14:22] chosen Us in him before the foundation
[14:25] of the world that we should be holding
[14:27] Without Blame before him in love having
[14:29] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[14:32] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[14:34] according to the good pleasure of his
[14:37] will to the praise of the glory of his
[14:40] grace wherein he hath made us accepted
[14:44] in the Beloved and now let's go over to
[14:48] Luke
[14:50] 24.
[14:53] I'm gonna start reading about verse 36
[14:56] this is right where the remember after
[14:59] the crucifixion and the and all and and
[15:02] the Lord is kind of a rumor around it he
[15:04] has risen and the two on the road to
[15:06] Emmaus is uh going and and the Lord
[15:09] appears to them and then they're gone
[15:11] back now to the disciples and they're
[15:15] beginning to relate to them you know of
[15:17] the things and we'll start reading in
[15:19] verse 36.
[15:21] and as they speak Jesus himself stood in
[15:23] the midst of them and said saith unto
[15:25] them peace be unto you but they were
[15:29] terrified in afraid and suppose that
[15:31] they had seen a spirit
[15:34] and he said unto them why are you
[15:36] troubled and why do you're right why do
[15:39] thoughts arise in your hearts behold my
[15:43] hands and my feet that is it is I myself
[15:45] handle me and see for a spirit hath not
[15:48] Flesh and Bones as you see me have and
[15:51] when he had thus spoken he showed them
[15:53] his hands and his feet and while they
[15:56] yet believe not for joy and wondered he
[15:59] said unto them have you any meat in
[16:03] order he's trying to make it to where
[16:05] then make sure that they understand he's
[16:08] real
[16:09] see so he says now you know in other
[16:11] words see me feel my hand handle me
[16:13] doing this that and the other and all
[16:15] now he's telling them what have you any
[16:17] meat and they gave him a piece of boiled
[16:20] fish and of a honeycomb and he took it
[16:23] and did eat thereof
[16:25] and did eat before them and he said unto
[16:27] them these are the words which I spake
[16:30] unto you while I was yet with you that
[16:32] all things must be fulfilled which were
[16:35] written in the law of Moses and in the
[16:37] prophets and in the Psalms concerning me
[16:40] then he then opened heed or
[16:42] understanding that they might understand
[16:44] the scriptures now watch what he opened
[16:48] he did not open all the understanding of
[16:52] the Bible That's not no reference no
[16:54] thoughts whatsoever involved in it he
[16:58] didn't open all of the understanding he
[17:01] only opened the the specific point and
[17:04] go to verse 46 and you'll see what he
[17:06] opened
[17:07] towards 45 and he opened her
[17:09] understanding but they might understand
[17:11] the scriptures and he said unto them
[17:13] thus it is written and thus it behoove
[17:16] Christ to suffer and to rise from the
[17:18] day at the third day and that repentance
[17:21] and remission of sin should be preached
[17:23] in his name among all nations beginning
[17:26] at Jerusalem and your Witnesses of these
[17:29] things
[17:30] and behold I send the promise of my
[17:32] father upon you but Terry you in the
[17:34] city of Jerusalem until you be endued
[17:37] with power from on high you may be
[17:39] seated the Lord that is blessing to the
[17:41] reading of the word now when we get back
[17:43] to that in a minute you think about it
[17:45] he didn't open their understanding of
[17:48] all the scriptures he just opened the
[17:51] understanding of the things that was
[17:54] related to that specific point or time
[17:58] or whatever that he was doing and
[18:01] dealing with them all right now but we
[18:04] we that's it if you will study the
[18:08] message next now it is the rising of the
[18:10] Sun and just you know follow the things
[18:13] through there and you will find the
[18:15] whole point of the message that we'll be
[18:17] trying to get to you know in in the
[18:20] further of the preaching but this one I
[18:24] want you to think about it
[18:27] and see I haven't taken as maybe you
[18:31] thought I would or just to take the
[18:32] future home and read a lot we've read a
[18:35] lot in it and I don't misunderstand
[18:36] somebody on takes it my Lord's read the
[18:38] whole book well that's pretty well true
[18:40] but I mean I just wasn't dealing with uh
[18:43] trying to show this justification
[18:47] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[18:49] Ghost because we should understand that
[18:52] that should be simple to us as we read
[18:55] the the prophet's message of the future
[18:58] home that there of the uh you know and
[19:01] seeing the the point of he said I want
[19:05] you to make sure and get the Plan of
[19:06] Redemption so we believe in what we
[19:10] believe in three stages in the bases or
[19:12] whatever you want to call it three steps
[19:15] um you use your own words
[19:17] as to applying to the soul of the
[19:21] individual
[19:23] and you could read in there what the
[19:25] prophet said about how that you know
[19:27] justification just chops off your past
[19:29] sins all right it says does nothing to
[19:33] the Future it's just a repentance in
[19:36] other words you come up and you
[19:37] recognize and you realize that the
[19:40] goodness of God the scripture said is
[19:42] what caused us to repentance see now
[19:44] just to repent is is not it it's when
[19:47] God calls you to repent
[19:49] brother Tom said one time we was talking
[19:51] he and I to this man and he said
[19:53] something and the guy and the guy said
[19:54] well I said saying I'm sorry it's simple
[19:57] you know that's just words in other
[19:59] words you don't mean it it's just words
[20:01] see so you can do that and a lot of
[20:03] people repent
[20:05] and all but uh you know maybe they don't
[20:08] go on
[20:09] to uh cleansing and and all of the doing
[20:12] what they need to do you know because if
[20:15] you repent of something you shouldn't
[20:16] want to go back and do that again you
[20:18] should want to get away from that you
[20:20] know and feel sorry for the way you've
[20:22] been all right then we we know from the
[20:25] future home that sanctification is a
[20:29] cleansing and setting aside of the heart
[20:31] of the individual
[20:33] see to worry that God can come and dwell
[20:36] because he's not going to dwell
[20:38] according to the scriptures he won't
[20:39] dwell in an unclean vessel all right so
[20:43] if he's not going to dwell in an unclean
[20:45] vessel then he had to cleanse it so you
[20:48] know like he says you've taken you go
[20:50] out into the yard and you see a glass or
[20:52] a cup or something and you pick it up
[20:55] that's you know you take that and that's
[20:59] justifying it you've got a use for it
[21:01] right all right and then see that's what
[21:04] God done with us he had to use for us so
[21:06] he he called us to himself and and then
[21:09] sanctification you take that in and you
[21:12] wash it and you cleanse it real good you
[21:14] know and and you get everything out of
[21:17] it because you don't want to put it in
[21:19] service while it's dirty right but
[21:21] sanctification is a cleansing and
[21:23] setting aside so that soul of the
[21:25] individual has to be washed of all of
[21:28] the old adamic nature and self that what
[21:31] we are and cleansed and you know and and
[21:34] come to church and and believing and
[21:37] seeing that we need to to live for the
[21:39] Lord and and you know be better and and
[21:42] be cleansed and set aside amen but see
[21:44] that's not the whole story and there's
[21:46] where the problem is that a lot of
[21:48] people do that and and they'll come to
[21:50] church and they begin to do that and
[21:53] they get a religious atmosphere about
[21:55] them and they they'll come to church and
[21:57] live in the church and do and and all
[21:59] but they don't go on to receiving the
[22:01] baptism of the Holy Spirit see and if
[22:04] they don't go on to receive the baptism
[22:06] of the Holy Spirit then it's not God's
[22:08] fault and see then there are some things
[22:11] left of us that just when we're
[22:13] Sanctified even though you're cleansed
[22:15] and set aside you need to fire a baptism
[22:18] that's why the scripture calls it the
[22:20] baptism of the Holy Ghost and Fire right
[22:22] the fire comes to burn out everything
[22:25] about us this left in the soul right all
[22:29] right the word God can come and and the
[22:31] prophet said in the future homes you
[22:33] ready makes it a place for God to dwell
[22:35] all right and see then that's why I
[22:38] believe that that the soul of the
[22:40] individual is eternal but the body and
[22:43] spirit is not Eternal right it's still
[22:46] in a separate even though we are a unit
[22:48] yes
[22:49] of Body Spirit and soul we're a unit and
[22:52] you'd say soul as a being right that's
[22:54] fine but just remember a Christian
[22:58] cannot sin in the soul right right so if
[23:01] a Christian sins and the prophet said he
[23:03] sinned every day so that sells it but
[23:05] that's you know and the Bible said if
[23:07] you say you sin not you make God a liar
[23:10] right all right because you know that's
[23:12] that's you know you can really lay down
[23:15] but ain't no need of it we ought to move
[23:16] on man see but see we we need to to see
[23:21] then that the body and the spirit of the
[23:22] individual is not fully redeemed right
[23:25] all right the soul is what's redeemed
[23:28] page 49 future home and you're waiting
[23:31] the Redemption of the body right then we
[23:34] found from the future home and studying
[23:36] it that the world this Earth
[23:39] in the days of Noah went through a time
[23:43] of washing it off right to justify it
[23:47] all right cleanse it to make a new world
[23:50] you know tumbled it all over and they
[23:54] dig down now for thousands of feet and
[23:56] uh uh the boss Daddy was telling me the
[23:59] other day he just read an article where
[24:01] they had went down like in a coal mine
[24:03] or some kind of an underground something
[24:05] and they found a modern day ship
[24:09] thousands of feet down below the surface
[24:12] sure right and you said well I don't
[24:14] know about that well they were modern in
[24:15] the days of the flood and where did all
[24:17] that go to all right you know where'd
[24:19] all just get dumped to they're finding
[24:21] things now that are that are just
[24:22] amazing
[24:24] you know way underground and things and
[24:26] and and you go up here in Kentucky and
[24:28] find uh alligator fossils wet up on the
[24:31] mountain you know but see it was a
[24:35] turmoil a twisting and turning in the
[24:37] days of of Noah right and the world was
[24:41] justified all right and then we found
[24:44] that the prophet was teaching that it
[24:46] had it that when Jesus was crucified
[24:49] that his blood dropped down on the earth
[24:51] to cleanse and claim the Earth
[24:56] all right so we're not going to get as
[24:59] we study then
[25:01] see and the Bible says the word pass
[25:03] away
[25:04] and we all thought that one of these
[25:06] days this world is going to be blasted
[25:08] away you know and we didn't think about
[25:10] where we was going to live or what was
[25:12] going to do but we found out that's not
[25:14] correct
[25:15] that it's going to be washed off
[25:17] cleansed and burned off right as far as
[25:21] man has tampered with it so it's the
[25:24] cosmos that's destroyed the world order
[25:26] amen and the situation of man all right
[25:29] but see it's already went through
[25:31] justification in the days of Noah
[25:33] sanctification when Jesus dropped his
[25:35] blood on it to cleanse and claim it this
[25:37] world this Earth all right but one day
[25:40] it will receive its fiery baptism right
[25:44] to burn off everything right and that'll
[25:48] not only be just a natural burning it
[25:50] will be a spiritual burning that will
[25:52] destroy Satan and all of his angels and
[25:56] the things that are wrong
[25:58] and it'll be a fiery baptism all right
[26:01] so then the Earth is in the process
[26:05] of being redeemed right but it's not in
[26:08] the finished part of it yeah right all
[26:10] right now see then we got to talking
[26:13] about it
[26:15] and see then now what are you going to
[26:16] do about your body because your body was
[26:17] in the earth so you can cover then about
[26:20] the body in the earth in the days of
[26:23] Noah when the world was washed off and
[26:25] and then you could talk about that it
[26:27] was in the earth in the days of when
[26:30] Jesus dropped his blood on it and
[26:32] claimed it but surely we don't want to
[26:35] have to wait until after the Millennium
[26:38] right is when the world is to be burned
[26:41] with fire and cleansed so we surely
[26:45] don't want to have to wait that long to
[26:47] get our you know redeemed body that's
[26:50] right see so then we must step ahead of
[26:53] the world or the Earth you know
[26:58] receive our body amen
[27:01] because God is not going to destroy the
[27:04] world
[27:05] so then he doesn't destroy our body he
[27:08] redeems it amen all right and see then I
[27:11] I believe in a rediction of the body
[27:13] right I don't believe in a replacement I
[27:17] don't believe in getting a new body I
[27:19] believe in this body being made new all
[27:21] right amen this body will become Eternal
[27:23] turn back to where we're we're 18 20
[27:26] years old but it won't just turn back
[27:28] there and start right back over again in
[27:31] age Factor amen it's to redeem right all
[27:35] right
[27:36] see then in that then we came to the end
[27:39] of it to talk about
[27:43] and I just mentioned it at the end of
[27:45] the message I said I'll get back to this
[27:46] all right that
[27:49] when you receive the new birth and I'm
[27:52] not going to try to prove a lot of
[27:53] points tonight I'm going to preach
[27:54] something to you and then the Lord
[27:56] willing will pick up Sunday and bring
[27:58] some more into uh showing you from the
[28:01] scriptures maybe in the things of of
[28:04] what the prophet is saying about it
[28:06] because see I believe we're going to be
[28:09] changed here right
[28:11] now because we read the Bible and we
[28:15] found in the Bible that we shall not all
[28:18] sleep
[28:19] right in first Thessalonians 15 learn
[28:21] about verse 5 that will not all sleep
[28:24] we're not all going to have to die
[28:28] and go by the ground that's right
[28:30] somebody's going to be changed right all
[28:33] right
[28:34] sure thing and doing that then we see
[28:36] that our bodies don't have to be
[28:38] destroyed it's not destroyed amen see
[28:42] it's redeemed right all right see then
[28:45] we we've talked about it and and we've
[28:47] seen that that even the scripture says
[28:50] you know in first Thessalonians that
[28:52] Paul explains how
[28:56] let this Rapture this change these
[29:00] things would take place that the Lord
[29:02] shall descend from heaven with a shout
[29:05] the voice of an archangel and a trumpet
[29:07] you know and and the dead in Christ
[29:09] shall rise first so why would we be
[29:11] looking for another body when the Bible
[29:15] had already been speaking of
[29:18] thee and has always spoken of even in
[29:21] the types and the Shadows of the Prophet
[29:23] that the Earth is to be redeemed you
[29:26] know
[29:27] why would we want to think about getting
[29:30] a new body
[29:32] but see that's people like if they look
[29:34] at their old cells and they just can't
[29:36] see how God can do anything with that
[29:39] well he's he's if he's lift it like it
[29:43] is it would be a problem right
[29:46] but see we already have the types and
[29:49] the Shadows we already have Abraham and
[29:51] Sarah turn back
[29:55] see to show us that we're going to go
[29:58] back to be young again right but
[30:01] remember the Earth was just a type
[30:04] that was turned back
[30:06] in all right they got old and died
[30:09] all right but that see this group of
[30:12] people in the income is not going to
[30:13] have to die right because we already
[30:16] know the message right
[30:18] right but is it a reality to us or is it
[30:22] as a quote
[30:25] now I'm asking you a simple point I try
[30:28] to to get across something to you in
[30:31] thinking and and try to help you to
[30:34] understand
[30:36] because we always read first
[30:38] Thessalonians and we said we wouldn't
[30:41] all sleep
[30:42] we would be changed right right that's
[30:45] all we bred around it come and add that
[30:47] to the Bible that was in the Bible we
[30:49] read that when where's the Baptist and
[30:51] we talked about it all right and we
[30:53] talked about it now no we didn't
[30:55] understand all of it right that's why I
[30:57] don't want to get you to them in amen
[30:59] but we read in Thessalonians that the
[31:02] Lord had said with the sin from Heavenly
[31:04] shout sure we had an attitude to do
[31:06] trumpets we had all kind of things but
[31:08] at least we could read
[31:11] all right right
[31:12] we could read
[31:14] why then would we be looking for
[31:18] another body
[31:20] I want to get that point to you
[31:23] could you say what but but but now
[31:26] brother there we we studied those
[31:28] scriptures we didn't have the
[31:29] understanding that we now have no but we
[31:32] had the reading of the scripture that's
[31:34] right
[31:35] that's right and we read them and talked
[31:37] about them
[31:39] why would we be looking for another body
[31:42] but to prove we didn't understand
[31:48] to prove we did not understand
[31:53] what Paul and Peter I mean Paul was
[31:55] saying in Thessalonians and Corinthians
[31:57] to prove we didn't understand it we
[32:01] believe we were going to get another
[32:02] body right now you know yourself you
[32:05] believe that I believe that we all
[32:07] believe that before this message came
[32:08] amen right
[32:10] so you pull him no I mean well go ahead
[32:13] and forget it
[32:15] but listen
[32:18] we proved what we
[32:21] believe about the scriptures
[32:24] by our self-interpretation amen
[32:28] of the fact that we were going to get a
[32:32] new body right amen right right
[32:36] now
[32:38] could it be
[32:41] that we still have
[32:44] um come on those problems come on Amen
[32:48] right
[32:49] but after all the prophet has said
[32:57] now prove the point after all that run
[33:00] around him has said about resurrection's
[33:02] not replacement what goes down comes up
[33:04] even Jesus would came up with nail
[33:06] prints in his hands and all other things
[33:09] all of that after all is said done
[33:12] a large portion of this message people
[33:14] still believe you're going to get
[33:15] another body yeah that's right exactly
[33:17] right so now it goes to prove do you
[33:20] understand right I like to I like to put
[33:22] something down there say boom now just
[33:25] get around that you know just dig a hole
[33:28] all you want to to get around that
[33:29] statement I just made because you're
[33:31] going to work yourself to death and when
[33:33] you get through you're gonna come right
[33:34] back all right amen and how to admit
[33:37] what was said was right right amen
[33:39] but see people are not going to admit it
[33:42] right
[33:43] they're going to keep going down the
[33:45] road right it won't work out all right
[33:48] now
[33:50] why would we be looking for a new body
[33:55] when we've got all of the background
[33:58] to show us that we're not to do that
[34:00] right amen but it's just body redeemed
[34:03] amen
[34:04] amen then we prove we don't oh but I've
[34:07] got all these posts written I got all
[34:09] these quotes I got all these quotes that
[34:10] are screwdriver way man
[34:14] right
[34:16] but
[34:17] will it line up with the Bible come on
[34:19] yeah right there amen will it line up
[34:22] with the Prophet come on no you have to
[34:24] deny some of the things he said all
[34:26] right bring me anything he said about a
[34:28] new body
[34:30] run said we're getting you Bobby
[34:32] I'll give you an isolated quote before
[34:34] he said we're gonna get a new body yeah
[34:39] but then take all the other statements
[34:41] where he said this body redeemed so
[34:44] what's he talking about come on Amen
[34:48] is he saying there's going to be a new
[34:50] body or is he just saying this body is
[34:53] going to be you right and he doesn't say
[34:55] it the way we want it in words right
[34:57] right which one is it
[34:59] yeah see do we understand all right
[35:02] but now listen
[35:06] could we be
[35:09] at the place
[35:12] the disciples were
[35:16] that we just read about
[35:22] no brother Dave we got the Holy Ghost
[35:25] what
[35:28] with the Holy Ghost right
[35:31] could we still be that way right
[35:34] because if you ever thought about the
[35:36] disciples
[35:39] Jesus opened their understanding of the
[35:42] scriptures
[35:44] and that was before Pentecost right
[35:47] right man
[35:48] we just read it in Luke
[35:54] till then you can have your
[35:55] understanding of the scriptures opened
[36:00] and still not have the new birth right
[36:02] amen
[36:06] I got one amen a couple of headshakes
[36:08] Amen
[36:09] you know
[36:14] but listen
[36:20] is it possible that we stand in the same
[36:23] way they stand or even move us up with
[36:26] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[36:29] you think about this a minute now
[36:32] you know that in Oral Roberts University
[36:34] they say they have brother Brown's
[36:36] message
[36:37] and that they study it
[36:42] you know that uh Neil frisbee was one
[36:45] they called a scroll Prophet the writer
[36:47] Prophet you know and all back down there
[36:50] and and to show you how that he went he
[36:52] he wrote a scroll and said that the the
[36:56] unidentifiable flying objects was aliens
[36:59] or something like that and something was
[37:01] said I forgot which way now if I do that
[37:03] wrong you put it in the right one but
[37:04] then he may just made a statement
[37:06] and when brother Brown said it was
[37:08] investigating angels
[37:11] he wrote a correction
[37:14] it was writing thus saith the Lord
[37:18] but when the prophet told it to be
[37:20] investigating Angels he wrote a
[37:22] correction
[37:24] and said corrected and then scroll
[37:25] throwing show and so and so it's
[37:27] investigating angels all right
[37:30] and uh
[37:32] my point is is he got his he's got his
[37:35] understanding open right
[37:37] all right
[37:39] and Oral Roberts University they can
[37:42] read all that wrote around said just
[37:44] like you read all that brother Brian
[37:46] said amen
[37:50] see we're in the day when the
[37:52] manifestation
[37:53] of all things nothing could be hit
[37:55] anymore God decide to run for president
[37:58] we don't even know his name I didn't
[37:59] know Obama's name I didn't know he
[38:01] existed as far as I was concerned I
[38:04] didn't even know how he lived in Hawaii
[38:05] it didn't matter to me
[38:07] and I never knew it but all at once
[38:09] here's Obama all right okay
[38:15] and before he went two weeks trying to
[38:17] run for president they'd already
[38:19] lambasting him about it he couldn't run
[38:21] because he wasn't an American citizen
[38:26] this is the day when you can't hide
[38:28] nothing no that's right amen because Bud
[38:31] didn't find you all right right
[38:33] they can go on the internet today and
[38:35] find out everything in the world about
[38:37] you
[38:38] all they need is your telephone number
[38:44] your telephone number today is more
[38:47] valuable to you to prove who you are
[38:49] than your birth certificate
[38:55] because they know who you are
[38:58] do you know if you ever applied for a
[39:00] birth certificate a copy or whatever try
[39:03] to relying it up
[39:04] do you know that a record from a
[39:07] baptismal service in a church is more
[39:10] authentic than a birth certificate
[39:16] did you know that
[39:19] they'll take it quicker because somebody
[39:22] says that's you
[39:23] when you can falsify all the others this
[39:26] isn't the day when they can just open it
[39:27] up and just get anything they want to
[39:29] that's right
[39:30] because it's a day of manifestation
[39:33] it's the day of the opening turn on the
[39:35] radio today and listen to some Baptist
[39:37] preacher be preaching about the seals
[39:40] and the white horse rider would be in
[39:42] the Antichrist and and you know the
[39:44] Pentecostals preaching it this way and
[39:46] then preaching it that way
[39:48] I heard a man one day preaching brother
[39:50] ratification write down the letters
[39:51] preaching the statue of perfect man
[39:53] right it's perfect as could be
[39:55] fine because his understanding had been
[39:59] opened
[40:03] getting what I'm saying
[40:06] see our understanding at Lula Georgia
[40:08] has been opened right now there's a lot
[40:12] of difference between a revelation
[40:15] in an opening of our understanding
[40:17] that's what my point of trying to get
[40:18] you to say Amen the disciples had their
[40:22] understanding open of the scriptures
[40:25] acts 1 and 8 they asked Jesus what I
[40:29] believe it's one and eight it says in
[40:31] the first chapter of Acts they asked him
[40:33] was he going to restore the kingdom to
[40:36] Israel at that time
[40:38] yeah that's right
[40:40] there was only that was the point I was
[40:42] trying to make when it says it opened
[40:44] their understanding of the scriptures go
[40:45] right on down that tells you what they
[40:47] opened he opened their understanding of
[40:49] who he was and how he had to die and how
[40:52] that repentance and remission of sins
[40:55] would be preached in his name and and
[40:57] the things that would take place and how
[40:58] the Holy Ghost would come right
[41:01] right but he didn't open their
[41:02] understanding of everything
[41:07] trying to find out what he's doing all
[41:10] right
[41:11] but get my point
[41:14] we can have our understanding of the
[41:16] scriptures open
[41:18] and not have one dab of Revelation right
[41:20] amen
[41:23] amen all you got to do is just get
[41:24] brother around his message and just read
[41:26] it
[41:27] and you can preach one God to the letter
[41:29] right
[41:31] and you can show all the in morphees and
[41:33] the theophanes and all of the great
[41:35] letters about it and great sweating
[41:38] speeches and
[41:40] yep
[41:43] it better not be a revelation what
[41:45] you'll have that's right that's right
[41:46] amen
[41:52] do I like to do this to get you to
[41:54] thinking
[41:57] you know he wrote around him I gave you
[41:59] a quote
[42:01] the number one on you
[42:03] no sir page 31 of the release of
[42:06] Revelation Jesus Christ but it's Church
[42:07] in each book
[42:10] you run around and proves a point
[42:15] now we can read in the Bible
[42:20] that by our new birth
[42:23] we are just as righteous as God is
[42:29] amen the Bible says it right
[42:31] that's right but he says our
[42:33] understanding has not been opened are
[42:35] you reading it on the notes
[42:39] our understanding hasn't been opened he
[42:42] said that's not real to most people
[42:47] I want to ask you a blunt question just
[42:50] don't raise your hand because both the
[42:51] mind's going to be up
[42:54] do you understand that you're just as
[42:56] righteous as God is
[42:58] many times as brother Branham have said
[43:01] that to us
[43:03] listen
[43:05] is it a revelation that we're just as
[43:08] righteous as God is
[43:11] come on
[43:13] mine's enough to say no
[43:16] mind's up to say I don't
[43:19] say that it's been revealed to me fully
[43:22] it's been partially revealed to me
[43:26] it's not fully been revealed to me that
[43:29] I'm just as righteous as God is
[43:33] do I need my understanding open to the
[43:36] scriptures what about you amen sir I'm
[43:41] just illustrating that then we'll get
[43:42] back to the point of the message
[43:45] right he said it's not real to most of
[43:48] us
[43:49] it's just a good scripture that's right
[43:54] what if all of our understanding is that
[43:57] away
[43:58] what if all of our understanding is just
[44:01] the things that has been opened unto us
[44:03] come on because we've read come on you
[44:07] know they used to say you know years ago
[44:08] you don't hear too much now but they
[44:10] used to say you know beware of that God
[44:12] has got all the answers
[44:15] well I just called the phrase on it you
[44:17] know I said Beware of a people after all
[44:20] the years they've studied the message
[44:21] and don't have no answers at all right
[44:24] I mean my Lord 40 years we've been
[44:27] reading
[44:29] I have right
[44:31] most of you are in the 20-year bracket
[44:35] in 20 to 40 years you've studied this
[44:37] message or even more than 40.
[44:41] we ought to have an understanding of
[44:44] what Rhode Island said amen that's right
[44:46] but you know what it's the most
[44:48] illiterate bunch of people you've ever
[44:50] met in your life because you go talk to
[44:52] the people of this message
[44:54] and just start saying a few things about
[44:56] what wrote around and said where'd he
[44:58] saying
[44:59] right
[45:00] I don't know where to say that or not
[45:02] man on a phone call me he said I don't
[45:04] know where he said I said would you hold
[45:05] on just a minute and let me go turn the
[45:07] computer on or are you going to believe
[45:09] me
[45:11] I said call you know if I'm gonna turn
[45:12] the computer on I gotta take time that
[45:14] I'm I'm going to prove to you what I'm
[45:16] saying right and I said you turn your
[45:18] computer on and you run it down if I
[45:20] ain't right you call me and let me know
[45:21] and I'll come to your church with a big
[45:24] sign on my back and say that I'm a liar
[45:26] I said that's how much I know what
[45:29] brother Randall said on that topic
[45:30] because I quoted it to him verbatim he
[45:33] said I don't know where brother runs
[45:34] that doesn't know
[45:36] I said go read the book
[45:40] could it be that we've had our
[45:42] understanding open to the scriptures
[45:44] right because of the intellectual
[45:48] conceptions that we have received by so
[45:51] much studying
[45:57] I've always told you how many remembers
[46:00] this statement brother Dale we said God
[46:03] would reveal in his heart what he's got
[46:05] in his head
[46:07] and many thousands of times have you
[46:09] heard that statement made
[46:12] but I don't claim that God has revealed
[46:14] to me all of the scriptures
[46:17] but what he's revealed to me I'll stand
[46:19] on
[46:21] it right
[46:22] like I said there the other day you can
[46:24] take a man of Peace you take a drunk
[46:27] that says truly drunk and really seen a
[46:30] peak elephant you put a lie detector's
[46:32] test on him it'll show he's seen a peak
[46:33] elephant when they don't exist
[46:37] me
[46:39] something that's revealed to you nobody
[46:41] can take it away from you
[46:43] right
[46:44] they can't deprogram a born-again
[46:47] Christian
[46:50] they deprogram people that are not born
[46:52] again right because that's
[46:54] intellectualism that's right that's
[46:56] right but you see we can have our
[46:58] understanding of the scriptures open
[47:00] that we can quote for any random about
[47:02] every scripture
[47:05] and then not be one dab of Revelation
[47:07] that's right
[47:11] no see that's what people don't want you
[47:13] to say those things because they say
[47:22] that was a revelation to brother Branham
[47:24] hmm
[47:27] that was a revelation to brother Branham
[47:31] right
[47:33] but it's not a revelation to me and you
[47:34] just because we can read it that's right
[47:36] because the Bible never changed come on
[47:39] it always read for you to baptize in the
[47:41] name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[47:43] it never said to baptize Father Son and
[47:46] Holy Ghost that's right right
[47:50] but yet we swore by and done it didn't
[47:52] we all right
[47:57] you understand what I'm saying
[48:00] we need a revelation
[48:03] more than anything amen right because a
[48:06] revelational change thing that's right
[48:08] amen
[48:09] that's right we can argue about quotes
[48:13] but when it's revealed there's no
[48:15] argument right amen those reveal to me
[48:18] I'm not going to argue we at all
[48:20] I'm gonna just tell you what I believe
[48:21] and walk off and leave you You Can Do
[48:23] What You Won't Do With It about it or
[48:24] whatever right because that's what I
[48:26] would expect you to do to me exactly
[48:31] when are we going to get
[48:33] gonna get we can tell people what we
[48:34] believe without having to pour blood
[48:36] around them amen
[48:40] now
[48:41] gee I don't need internet
[48:45] I'm holding up that's right
[48:47] uh 12 quotes
[48:50] and that's a very short amount I'm
[48:51] trying to be good to Richard because
[48:53] Joe's not here and I'm trying to hit
[48:55] Richard where he don't have to put so
[48:56] many quotes in the computer to where it
[48:58] goes out on the computer system out
[49:00] there so if anybody's ever listened to
[49:02] me two sermons you know I'm quoting
[49:04] brother Branham all the time right
[49:08] a lot of times it's about 98 of the
[49:10] whole message
[49:11] so you know that I'm not saying
[49:14] something wrong when I say quotes will
[49:17] kill you amen that's correct
[49:20] quotes will blow your head up to where
[49:22] that you cannot get in a building with
[49:25] it it's so big
[49:27] right but a revelation will humble you
[49:30] until you crawl under a 10 gallon hat
[49:32] and leave plenty of room
[49:35] right
[49:37] a lot of difference in Revelation
[49:39] and intellect
[49:42] but see without a revelation of what's
[49:44] being said
[49:47] we're just like the disciples right amen
[49:50] that's right having
[49:53] their understanding open right now I'll
[49:57] get off that in a minute so just get
[49:58] what I'm saying now
[50:01] the people on the radios the news media
[50:04] I mean the the uh the uh the radio
[50:06] Christian radio there you listen to them
[50:10] you know how run around says certain
[50:12] things and you know how people will say
[50:14] it and you say hey that old boy was in
[50:16] the field
[50:17] 155.
[50:19] you give him the place and already
[50:22] agreed off huh
[50:23] but you see
[50:29] it's opening of understanding right
[50:33] a lot of difference between Revelation
[50:35] that's right and understanding being
[50:37] open
[50:39] now if we don't get it in the field
[50:41] there's no way for us to get a
[50:44] revelation right no that's right amen
[50:47] all right
[50:50] so then in doing that now take that with
[50:53] all of the message
[50:59] but remember one thing
[51:02] it did not give them eternal life
[51:06] because he opened their understanding of
[51:10] the scripture that's right
[51:12] they still had to go to Pentecost to
[51:15] receive and turn right amen amen all
[51:17] right all right it is not eternal life
[51:21] to you and I to be able to quote brother
[51:23] Branham or the Bible
[51:28] it is only when the Holy Spirit can
[51:31] Quicken that unto us right and make it
[51:33] alive amen that's right
[51:35] oh we call it see right yeah we read
[51:40] between the lines
[51:43] blessings
[51:46] well
[51:49] agree with that because that's what
[51:50] brother Raymond said about it right but
[51:52] now they brought around what he said but
[51:54] was between the lines is it contrary to
[51:56] watch online no
[51:58] is it different from what was on the
[52:00] line
[52:03] now what was the point of used to
[52:05] express it
[52:06] he said now like Abraham and Sarah
[52:09] said it doesn't say that they were made
[52:11] Young
[52:13] he said but we read between the lines
[52:15] amen and we see that they were well
[52:18] stricken in a age and done past
[52:20] childbearing the word said right
[52:23] and then they were made to the basement
[52:25] to be able to Bear children so they must
[52:27] have been turned back Young
[52:28] he said now that's reading between the
[52:30] lines we
[52:35] are right yeah
[52:37] I've heard people say we read between
[52:39] the lines and my revelation of seventh
[52:41] seal is polygamy
[52:43] it's all right have all the wise you
[52:45] want um
[52:46] Now where's that reading that's not even
[52:49] in Greer's Almanac
[52:51] let alone the Bible or the prophets
[52:53] message right
[52:55] right
[52:57] or McDonald's either one if you're in
[52:59] Jamaica
[53:02] but now listen
[53:04] what we need is a revelation
[53:09] do you come to church praying
[53:11] for God to reveal to you something today
[53:16] right that ought to be our greatest
[53:18] desire
[53:22] you know not because I'm getting older
[53:24] but it's getting to the bases of this
[53:25] old world getting back looking my bad
[53:32] me but now we've got enough
[53:34] understanding right
[53:36] okay
[53:38] you following me we've got enough
[53:41] understanding by hearing the prophet
[53:45] that there's only
[53:47] going to be a small group of people to
[53:49] be saved right and if we stayed around
[53:52] here a thousand more years it wouldn't
[53:53] be one more save than what were the
[53:55] names written in the last book of life
[53:56] and foundation of the world right that's
[53:59] understanding isn't it right
[54:03] right
[54:05] I mean I had to understand it
[54:09] and I could read that first seal
[54:13] and I could see that brother Randall
[54:15] says the white horse rider
[54:18] is the Antichrist all right
[54:22] well I had enough understanding to
[54:23] realize that he was the prophet and I
[54:25] wasn't so
[54:28] you know
[54:30] if him being the prophet I'm going to
[54:32] take what he said about it
[54:34] whether I understood it or not
[54:38] but you know what one day the Lord
[54:39] revealed that to me
[54:43] and when he revealed it to me it was not
[54:46] a different wording at all of what the
[54:48] letter on the page said
[54:51] letter on the page says here stands the
[54:54] white horse rider your standard lamp
[54:55] with a boogie down there goes the White
[54:56] Horse Rider riding off says everybody's
[54:58] got to be the Antichrist right amen he
[55:00] said see that guy riding off see that
[55:02] fella riding off see that other person
[55:04] there
[55:06] you know it's revealed to me
[55:08] right
[55:10] that the Waterworks Rider with the
[55:11] Antichrist
[55:14] and is it just a quote to you
[55:17] or has that been revealed now come on up
[55:19] see brother Dale made that statement and
[55:22] and can and then you go quote what
[55:24] brother Dale said
[55:26] right is that a revelation or is that an
[55:28] understanding of the scriptures open to
[55:30] you
[55:32] right
[55:35] what's your revelation
[55:42] and we know for sure that our Revelation
[55:44] can't be any contrary to what the
[55:46] prophets was
[55:47] and what the Bible says amen
[55:49] right
[55:52] just get a little background say a few
[55:54] words
[55:57] but you understand
[55:58] because their understanding of the
[56:00] scriptures was open did not give them
[56:03] eternal life
[56:06] our understanding we can understand
[56:08] brother Brown's message to the letter
[56:10] and be able to quote everything he says
[56:12] and have a photographic memory of
[56:14] everything that he would say and that is
[56:16] not one dab of eternal life
[56:21] all right
[56:23] be wonderful but still it's not a doubt
[56:26] of eternal life
[56:29] he says why people are afraid to talk
[56:31] like I do
[56:34] because they don't know where to stand
[56:37] all right
[56:39] like a brother told me one time he said
[56:40] you ain't nothing but a Baptist
[56:43] you just put the word together
[56:48] but a few days later he looked at me and
[56:50] he said but I
[56:51] I know better than the food we
[56:55] he said because you can take the Bible
[56:57] in the message and turn me to Pieces
[56:58] right
[57:03] but you know what I look back and you've
[57:04] heard me say it many times I look back
[57:06] at it myself yes and you know I won't do
[57:09] it
[57:15] because this is not a tarp equal to part
[57:17] thing right man this is a revelation of
[57:20] Jesus Christ right
[57:22] this is the life it's not an argument
[57:26] quote that's right
[57:29] brother told me that he heard these two
[57:31] men talking when they got to computers
[57:33] and they said now we can quote with
[57:35] brother Dale well boy isn't that
[57:36] something
[57:40] quote with somebody
[57:43] my goodness folks
[57:46] but get the point
[57:48] we can have our understanding open
[57:51] but do we have the Revelation come on
[57:53] Amen right
[57:57] we need to apply this law of what we're
[58:00] talking about our way of presenting it
[58:03] to all of the scriptures and all of the
[58:06] prophet's message
[58:09] do we have understanding of the message
[58:11] by reading and studying it
[58:14] but we need to have it made alive to us
[58:17] right amen now let's apply this to the
[58:20] Redemption of our bodies
[58:23] that we live in
[58:25] because we have the message to show the
[58:29] Redemption of the Soul justification
[58:31] same case Matthew baptism
[58:33] we have the message to show us in the
[58:36] scriptures to show us justification for
[58:39] the Earth in the days of Noah
[58:40] sanctification and days of the Lord
[58:42] Jesus and and of fiery baptism to come
[58:45] after the millennial Reign and and all
[58:47] to burn off everything we have that as
[58:49] an understanding
[58:52] but can we bring the body through the
[58:55] scriptures and redeem it
[59:00] and show where it's at come on
[59:03] me
[59:05] now all this what I just got to saying
[59:07] was a background
[59:11] in other words lay it down something to
[59:14] the background and now let's apply this
[59:17] application
[59:18] to the understanding of the Redemption
[59:21] of the body right right
[59:24] because it's got to be revealed to
[59:25] somebody one day that they're fully
[59:27] redeemed right amen and then God can
[59:30] take and make it manifest that's right
[59:31] right but until that's revealed
[59:35] you say well I wonder why our body while
[59:37] we're here after 40 years because it
[59:39] hasn't been revealed amen is that
[59:42] sensible
[59:44] had it been revealed to us 40 years ago
[59:47] what the to what we've been studying in
[59:49] the adoption Romans 8 and 23.
[59:52] the adoption to wit the Redemption of
[59:55] our body
[59:59] it doesn't say to Redemption there is to
[1:00:01] wit to understand the Redemption of our
[1:00:03] body right
[1:00:05] is he brought a random comment I've
[1:00:07] tried to explain it to you he come to
[1:00:09] bring us the Plan of Salvation right
[1:00:13] for the Earth
[1:00:15] for the soul of man
[1:00:18] and for the body of man right
[1:00:22] well actually we just put this over here
[1:00:24] put that over there all right put that
[1:00:26] over there and we're gonna have to wait
[1:00:27] for the Redemption of our body when the
[1:00:29] world is to annihilated after the
[1:00:31] Millennium right
[1:00:35] you see that won't work that's right
[1:00:40] can it to what did we go through
[1:00:45] join in the scriptures that
[1:00:49] the prophet said page 49 I gave back to
[1:00:51] you again where you can read it
[1:00:53] that the soul is redeemed
[1:00:57] but we're waiting the Redemption of the
[1:00:59] body
[1:01:00] but he says it's growing on in other
[1:01:03] words a process
[1:01:05] is taking place
[1:01:09] now they gave you one bear from who is
[1:01:12] this Melchizedek
[1:01:14] my brother Randall said it's already
[1:01:16] started
[1:01:19] the Redemption of our bodies already
[1:01:22] started
[1:01:26] to then at the end of the message last
[1:01:28] Wednesday I made the statement and said
[1:01:30] I'll explain later
[1:01:32] but I said today God gave you the new
[1:01:35] birth
[1:01:37] the day he gave you the new birth that
[1:01:41] day he redeemed your body
[1:01:44] right
[1:01:46] the day he gave you the new birth he
[1:01:49] redeemed it amen amen that's when I'm
[1:01:51] getting older
[1:01:52] I received it when I was 10 and I'm 70.
[1:01:56] Jesus brother random says I gave it back
[1:01:59] to you future home
[1:02:02] from this part of the earth I have
[1:02:04] redeemed which is on the River Jordan
[1:02:05] where it said this in my beloved Son in
[1:02:08] whom I'm pleased to dwell
[1:02:09] right around said from this part of the
[1:02:12] earth I have redeemed his body and I've
[1:02:14] come to live in it and from that I'm
[1:02:16] going to redeem the rest right amen
[1:02:18] three and a half years in the most
[1:02:20] horrible life
[1:02:22] of the Lord Jesus that he'd ever lived
[1:02:25] yeah
[1:02:27] God said he's redeemed right there
[1:02:29] yep
[1:02:36] I'm trying to talk to you by revelation
[1:02:39] but I realized that the opening of our
[1:02:42] understanding has to come by words we
[1:02:45] use right that's right amen
[1:02:48] foreign
[1:02:50] though the New Birth the prophet said
[1:02:52] and I gave you a bunch of quote he said
[1:02:54] it's the most important thing in your
[1:02:56] life
[1:03:00] but who's seeking for the baptism well
[1:03:02] the Holy Ghost well okay when I believe
[1:03:04] and to prove it I believe this message
[1:03:06] yeah
[1:03:10] could that be you had the understanding
[1:03:12] of your your understanding open right
[1:03:17] yeah
[1:03:19] Jesus's body was redeemed right by her
[1:03:22] when God came down and United with him
[1:03:24] not that he wasn't already God that's
[1:03:27] right
[1:03:29] and he didn't need that baptism of the
[1:03:32] Holy Ghost
[1:03:34] to give him eternal life right he
[1:03:36] already had eternal life he was eternal
[1:03:38] life
[1:03:40] it was an example for you and I
[1:03:43] but you see I know what it is it's hard
[1:03:45] to get people to say
[1:03:47] when I got the new bird God's pleased to
[1:03:50] dwell in me but one of these days I
[1:03:52] believe one of these days he'd be
[1:03:53] pleased and dwell in me you ain't got
[1:03:55] corn on it that's that's blood around
[1:03:57] since dinner in the soup made over a
[1:03:59] chatter my chicken is starting to death
[1:04:01] what are you talking about
[1:04:04] you're saying God made you perfect and
[1:04:06] you're saying you need perfection
[1:04:12] when the day God
[1:04:15] leave the cloud all right where is he
[1:04:18] living amen come on he being inside of
[1:04:22] us that's right
[1:04:24] that's right he's pleased to dwell
[1:04:26] that's right
[1:04:28] yeah when are we going to start
[1:04:29] confessing that amen
[1:04:31] when are we gonna start saving saying
[1:04:33] we're just as righteous as God is by the
[1:04:35] new birth that we have inside of us
[1:04:37] that's right right unless we confess it
[1:04:41] God can't make it alive that's right
[1:04:44] amen
[1:04:46] see Jesus's body was redeemed in three
[1:04:49] and a half years before the crime after
[1:04:52] the change or the resurrection and the
[1:04:54] things took place
[1:04:55] amen
[1:04:57] the day you receive the new birth God
[1:04:59] said right there I lay claim on his body
[1:05:01] yep amen and he ain't going to get a new
[1:05:04] one nope
[1:05:08] folks that's proof
[1:05:10] that you're not going to get a new one
[1:05:11] right amen
[1:05:14] because it would have been like some of
[1:05:15] them are saying that we don't know how
[1:05:16] the Holy Ghost yet we just got an
[1:05:18] anointing oh Lord have mercy the morning
[1:05:23] they're saying that in a message man
[1:05:25] I've been at it for 40 something years
[1:05:30] where are they preaching the new birth
[1:05:32] today
[1:05:34] that's right come on a lot of you listen
[1:05:36] on the internet
[1:05:40] I think she had a word about it
[1:05:46] you don't have to raise your hand you
[1:05:48] don't have to hit but write down on a
[1:05:50] piece of paper or somebody you've heard
[1:05:52] preaching on the new birth in the past
[1:05:54] 20 years
[1:05:56] and turn it into me
[1:05:59] I would love to hear it
[1:06:06] all right
[1:06:08] because you know it's not being done
[1:06:11] oh now they're saying the new birth is
[1:06:13] just the Baptist it's just the baptism
[1:06:15] we don't have to go through just the
[1:06:17] same things about you it's just a
[1:06:18] baptism
[1:06:20] it's just believing this message
[1:06:25] no I'm still a firm old believer in
[1:06:27] justification is the work of the Holy
[1:06:29] Spirit sanctification of the work of the
[1:06:31] Holy Spirit and the baptism is the holy
[1:06:33] spirit I'm still a firmal believer in
[1:06:35] each stage there that you must live
[1:06:37] through right
[1:06:40] and saying it would be a very very rare
[1:06:43] rare rare rare rare rare rare occasion
[1:06:45] for anybody to go through it at one time
[1:06:48] right yeah
[1:06:50] and maybe I didn't put enough rice in
[1:06:52] there
[1:06:56] but what are we doing
[1:06:58] is our understanding of the scriptures
[1:07:00] open
[1:07:01] or do we have a revelation right
[1:07:08] when I said that Wednesday night I
[1:07:10] thought
[1:07:11] that the biggest portion of the people
[1:07:13] in this church are going to be standing
[1:07:14] on their feet when they get through
[1:07:15] making this statement
[1:07:19] and I only got one or two amen
[1:07:23] right I literally thought
[1:07:26] most of you would be rejoicing
[1:07:30] because you had learned the Redemption
[1:07:33] of the body
[1:07:35] and how the process has taken place
[1:07:39] and it started with our new birth I
[1:07:43] already know that brother though all
[1:07:45] right
[1:07:47] all right
[1:07:51] so I've always preached
[1:07:53] that same thing
[1:07:56] but now it's revelation
[1:07:59] my difference in it too
[1:08:03] you see we prove what we are of what we
[1:08:06] do right
[1:08:11] that's why people walking away you know
[1:08:13] going other places doing things that's
[1:08:15] their business ain't nothing to me but
[1:08:17] it's one point
[1:08:19] how can you leave the word if you say
[1:08:21] the word here
[1:08:23] and all that's ever that's left from
[1:08:25] here before they left here they said the
[1:08:27] word was here
[1:08:30] man
[1:08:33] now brother Dale you're too plain
[1:08:35] you shouldn't talk like that why
[1:08:40] how much longer we got to play around
[1:08:46] age-wise there's a lot of us in trouble
[1:08:51] but I shed a lot I'm looking at a lot of
[1:08:55] gray hairs and
[1:08:57] and some that put stuff on it to keep it
[1:09:00] looking great but that ain't gonna
[1:09:01] change the roots of it
[1:09:04] I'll be it
[1:09:06] Roots will tell what it is
[1:09:10] but you see we ain't got time right
[1:09:14] we ain't got another 40 years that's
[1:09:15] right that's right
[1:09:18] I've never made dates sometimes with
[1:09:20] Seasons you know better than that
[1:09:23] I say that we need 40 more years what
[1:09:25] little bit I understand of the message
[1:09:27] that I believe needs to be revealed to
[1:09:29] us it's going to take it take me 40 more
[1:09:31] years to preach it where we can see it
[1:09:33] I'm not a joke
[1:09:36] because I'm trying to preach to you
[1:09:38] where we can get a revelation amen
[1:09:40] amen not an intellectual conception
[1:09:43] sure we've studied the message
[1:09:47] we can say we preached one God okay we
[1:09:50] preached marriage and divorce we preach
[1:09:52] to seal all of that wonderful
[1:09:55] but if it's not revealed right
[1:09:59] that's right
[1:10:03] it's the same thing as I gave to where
[1:10:05] we took it 31 of the church a book where
[1:10:07] the Prophet said to most people this is
[1:10:09] just a good quote
[1:10:11] it we're just as righteousness God Is by
[1:10:13] being in Jesus Christ
[1:10:19] do you know that most of the quotes that
[1:10:21] I gave you were brought around and said
[1:10:22] that when you received the new birth you
[1:10:25] have everything you need for the journey
[1:10:27] do you know what Mo you know what the
[1:10:30] biggest fortunate people thinks that
[1:10:31] means
[1:10:33] that means they don't need to get
[1:10:35] nothing else because they got everything
[1:10:37] when they believed oh my they got
[1:10:40] everything one day except in Jesus
[1:10:42] Christ they believe this message spread
[1:10:44] around them didn't say that read the
[1:10:46] quotes right come on we can read them
[1:10:48] there's no need of it
[1:10:50] he said keep breaking in and pushing out
[1:10:53] the more you drink in the more you push
[1:10:56] out
[1:10:57] the more of the message you take in the
[1:11:00] more God can reveal to us
[1:11:03] amen
[1:11:05] right
[1:11:09] but people would say yeah look right
[1:11:11] around said it got everything I needed
[1:11:13] red bell preached about that statue of
[1:11:15] perfect man I don't need that I got
[1:11:17] everything when I was born again oh my
[1:11:20] good Baptist Doctrine right
[1:11:23] I said I got everything when I believed
[1:11:31] but what about it
[1:11:36] what about it
[1:11:38] we're growing on
[1:11:43] it
[1:11:45] we understand the mechanical side of the
[1:11:50] message
[1:11:53] I ain't seeing everybody around the
[1:11:55] country preaching on it because I just
[1:11:56] got through asking that question how
[1:11:57] many bricks on any bird what if you
[1:11:59] don't preach on any birth then there's
[1:12:00] one thing for certain you don't know
[1:12:01] what your new birth is because that's
[1:12:03] just the point
[1:12:05] but see we can talk about how that the
[1:12:07] new birth Rings assist we can talk how
[1:12:09] the adoption brings us this we can talk
[1:12:11] about it this brings to this and the
[1:12:13] opening the word brings to this but if
[1:12:15] it's not a revelation
[1:12:18] amen we have had our understanding
[1:12:20] opened
[1:12:21] of the scriptures
[1:12:25] we're just like the disciples
[1:12:30] because as I said the disciples still
[1:12:32] wanted to know in Acts 1 what Jesus was
[1:12:34] going to do all right
[1:12:36] that isn't come on folks I hate to talk
[1:12:40] but isn't it true around this message
[1:12:42] that people don't know what in the
[1:12:43] world's going on
[1:12:50] if California went under right now most
[1:12:52] of the people of this message would blow
[1:12:54] their brain up
[1:12:56] because they'd say they don't miss the
[1:12:58] rapture
[1:13:04] right
[1:13:05] sure
[1:13:06] when it didn't happen in 1973 in 1977
[1:13:11] what happened to the people of the
[1:13:13] message they sent their books back to
[1:13:15] Jeffersonville they got out of the
[1:13:16] message
[1:13:19] yeah
[1:13:20] show me you
[1:13:22] look back there and remember those days
[1:13:25] when everything happened
[1:13:29] would you say brother day or what what
[1:13:32] would you do if California went under I
[1:13:33] say praise the Lord there's an
[1:13:35] earthquake number one because according
[1:13:37] to I believe what the Bible and the
[1:13:39] prophet says is going to be two major
[1:13:40] ones
[1:13:44] and one can bring the resurrection right
[1:13:46] amen but another one will open the
[1:13:48] seventh The Sixth Seal right
[1:13:53] because it opened with an earthquake and
[1:13:55] you better not put the bride over there
[1:13:58] when the seal breaks because you've got
[1:14:00] an accribulation you done messed up all
[1:14:02] the prophets said we don't go through
[1:14:04] the tribulation
[1:14:06] so you see
[1:14:11] but could that just be an opening
[1:14:14] of our understanding
[1:14:16] right a sensible reasoning out of
[1:14:19] factors
[1:14:21] a taking of things and that's what the
[1:14:23] brother told me there was a Baptist
[1:14:25] because see where the Baptist brother
[1:14:26] and I said you better leave them alone
[1:14:27] now what he's talking about is they will
[1:14:30] take the Bible and dissect it or a
[1:14:33] thought and dissect it
[1:14:36] I tell the brother read about my sister
[1:14:38] my brother-in-law was a Baptist preacher
[1:14:40] he's had four years in college
[1:14:43] and my sister was teaching a class one
[1:14:46] day
[1:14:48] and they they you know somebody gave it
[1:14:51] to her she took it or something and she
[1:14:52] went back and picked up like this town
[1:14:54] or this person or something
[1:14:56] and she studied it out and she brought
[1:14:59] it to the group and she laid it down
[1:15:01] step by step where this came from here
[1:15:03] this year this year this year this year
[1:15:05] and this year and right down you know
[1:15:07] like that
[1:15:09] and when it was finished the lady in the
[1:15:11] congregation said where in the world did
[1:15:13] you get that
[1:15:17] my brother-in-law was the Baptist
[1:15:19] preacher he said she must have got it
[1:15:21] out of Greer's Almanac
[1:15:23] um
[1:15:29] she took him home and set him down
[1:15:34] and she laid her down she said you go
[1:15:37] back and apologize
[1:15:41] she had the scriptures to the letter yep
[1:15:44] and he didn't even know it
[1:15:48] see that's a Baptist
[1:15:50] the people of this message have the
[1:15:52] quotes to the letter right
[1:15:56] I've never said nothing other than
[1:15:59] telling me I got a lot in my head it's
[1:16:02] just letter
[1:16:03] yep
[1:16:04] what's in my heart is revealed amen
[1:16:08] don't worry about that part what's in
[1:16:10] that head is running around there and
[1:16:13] it's mighty confusion
[1:16:16] how many of you ever said to me because
[1:16:19] I just know I've said it to you you say
[1:16:21] one day one time I see one God so clear
[1:16:23] it's just beautiful I can just follow it
[1:16:25] all the way down in the next few minutes
[1:16:27] later it's just like it's gone and I
[1:16:29] don't even know what in the world I'm
[1:16:30] talking about
[1:16:32] right that's right
[1:16:35] right sure
[1:16:37] could be intellectualism
[1:16:41] that's right
[1:16:43] nothing wrong with intellectualism
[1:16:46] thank you
[1:16:48] we must have it
[1:16:51] the disciples had to have their
[1:16:53] understanding opened before they could
[1:16:56] make it to Pentecost right sure all
[1:16:59] right
[1:17:01] had they not Jesus had not opened their
[1:17:03] understanding
[1:17:06] now I've read it to you and we read
[1:17:08] there that when he appeared to him they
[1:17:10] first thought he was a spirit
[1:17:12] right he tried to make it more
[1:17:14] convincing by saying come and feel me
[1:17:16] all right
[1:17:17] a spirit hath not flesh and Bone
[1:17:24] didn't get it
[1:17:26] I'm a rich if I don't let it get it he
[1:17:29] said if you've got any bread
[1:17:31] right
[1:17:33] he brought it to a natural thing that
[1:17:35] they could not question because he ate
[1:17:37] the bread and the fish right
[1:17:39] right and it didn't go floating through
[1:17:40] the wall
[1:17:44] blessing and he was in a glorified body
[1:17:46] that's right right
[1:17:53] you see
[1:17:54] could we have our understanding open
[1:17:56] come on
[1:17:58] and not have a revelation right
[1:18:03] what about it how can you deal with
[1:18:05] different
[1:18:07] see Paul said in what is it
[1:18:10] Thessalonians or Corinthians 1 he said
[1:18:12] Corinthians I think he said I show you a
[1:18:14] mystery
[1:18:17] right in Corinthians I show you a
[1:18:20] mystery we shall not all flee
[1:18:24] 1551 15 51. we shall not all fleas
[1:18:31] I'll show you a mystery yeah a mystery
[1:18:35] is something that has not been
[1:18:37] previously revealed
[1:18:42] right
[1:18:43] so Paul said
[1:18:45] this has not been previously revealed
[1:18:48] but I say unto you we shall not all
[1:18:51] sleep so
[1:18:53] everybody thought before then
[1:18:57] that they had to go to sleep or die in
[1:19:00] other words
[1:19:03] brother random come and told us many
[1:19:05] Mysteries
[1:19:11] but could it be that we just knowing by
[1:19:13] heading on it come on
[1:19:18] hang on next time
[1:19:20] how do you know the difference not a
[1:19:22] deal
[1:19:26] how do you know the difference
[1:19:31] because you can't take away
[1:19:34] what's been revealed to me that's right
[1:19:36] that's right yep that's right you can't
[1:19:39] take away what I've told you I've seen
[1:19:45] no matter what you do you can't take it
[1:19:47] away
[1:19:49] brother Al said what you need to do
[1:19:51] sometimes just let go up there to look
[1:19:53] like and let brother Dale see if he can
[1:19:55] talk you out of what you believe
[1:19:57] remember that brother
[1:20:00] this name see if he can talk you out of
[1:20:03] what you believe
[1:20:04] if I talked you out of it it's not a
[1:20:06] revelation right
[1:20:09] if you are afraid to talk to me about
[1:20:11] what you see
[1:20:13] right
[1:20:15] it is not a revelation to you that's
[1:20:19] right
[1:20:20] because I'm not as scared of the
[1:20:22] wrong
[1:20:23] or the pokes of this message
[1:20:26] that's right but that's it
[1:20:29] I'll just tell you what I believe
[1:20:32] and if you give me an opportunity I'll
[1:20:35] tell you why
[1:20:37] that I believe
[1:20:42] then you say well now right here brother
[1:20:44] Dale
[1:20:45] Prophet said so and so I said okay let's
[1:20:46] wait this minute and it'll all be put
[1:20:48] together
[1:20:53] but you see some of the things that God
[1:20:55] has spoke to me about is revealed some
[1:20:58] of the things is opening of my
[1:20:59] understanding has been open to where did
[1:21:01] I see their right and I believed it all
[1:21:04] right all right but I'm waiting for
[1:21:06] Revelation what about you right amen
[1:21:08] amen
[1:21:11] do you understand
[1:21:14] that when you receive the new birth
[1:21:22] that your body was redeemed
[1:21:26] scripture we gave
[1:21:28] now we'll use it because I'll use it
[1:21:31] later
[1:21:32] what was the last scripture we gave
[1:21:35] I said you want a scripture for the fact
[1:21:37] that your body would redeem the day you
[1:21:39] received the new birth
[1:21:41] I said what about the Bible it said what
[1:21:43] if our enrollments were
[1:21:45] those who Justified
[1:21:47] he had already
[1:21:50] glorified right amen
[1:21:55] now I'm going to make a statement strong
[1:21:58] because I've been studying
[1:22:01] about 98 of the times brother random
[1:22:04] uses that quote
[1:22:07] he is talking about a glorified body I'm
[1:22:10] excusing a theophany
[1:22:13] a celestial
[1:22:15] I say 98 somewhere close to 95 percent
[1:22:19] there's only a very few quotes that he's
[1:22:21] really dealing with the glorified human
[1:22:24] mortal body
[1:22:28] he said well why because we first need
[1:22:32] the spiritual right
[1:22:34] right
[1:22:35] we first need to plan a Redemption amen
[1:22:39] we need to know about our theosomy amen
[1:22:43] right
[1:22:46] do we have one up there or is it down
[1:22:49] here or is it at
[1:22:51] well it don't matter to me I just got
[1:22:53] one yeah
[1:22:59] to see
[1:23:03] those we Justified he's already
[1:23:07] the day you receive that new birth you
[1:23:10] glorified your body right in his
[1:23:13] presence right right
[1:23:17] one day that will catch up with it
[1:23:20] amen
[1:23:21] right you remember five eight years ago
[1:23:25] when I preached a series called matching
[1:23:27] pieces
[1:23:29] they're putting those down on the tape
[1:23:31] system to where you can get them on the
[1:23:32] Internet
[1:23:33] probably 40 sermons or more
[1:23:37] called matching pieces
[1:23:41] whenever
[1:23:43] what God's seen there
[1:23:47] is matched with it here
[1:23:49] we've got to go that's right sure why
[1:23:52] hasn't it been because it's not matching
[1:23:54] Central
[1:23:59] when we see ourselves dire
[1:24:03] as we stand here
[1:24:07] then we can go better
[1:24:10] yep
[1:24:11] but all of the talking about going there
[1:24:14] and how far it is and
[1:24:17] let's just knowledge
[1:24:20] I want a revelation folks right man
[1:24:24] I want revelation what I've got in my
[1:24:26] head
[1:24:27] drop down in my heart and be revealed to
[1:24:30] me
[1:24:32] because I welcome man come on
[1:24:36] I can walk on what God's revealed to me
[1:24:40] I can be like the old color brother was
[1:24:41] you know
[1:24:42] here in the Bible
[1:24:48] right you can't even read he said no but
[1:24:51] I've Been Told
[1:24:53] it said holy Bible on there
[1:24:57] then when I watched if God told you in
[1:25:00] that Bible to go jump through that wall
[1:25:01] he said I would jump he said to be up to
[1:25:05] God to have a whole made by the time I
[1:25:07] get there
[1:25:08] see that's the way we've got to get
[1:25:14] we got to get to the place
[1:25:17] Abraham believed God
[1:25:19] and it was imputed of doing for
[1:25:21] noxiousness
[1:25:22] take on these things
[1:25:25] do we have a revelation or intellect
[1:25:27] well 369 in the red book
[1:25:30] 369. anybody have a need
[1:25:37] the body of God is Jesus the prince of
[1:25:41] peace
[1:25:47] a wonderful Lord and wisdom by who all
[1:25:51] things were made
[1:25:57] history
[1:26:03] is
[1:26:27] I hope everything
[1:26:38] that's what they believe
[1:26:41] drawing and
[1:26:44] let me know
[1:26:47] in his voice
[1:26:56] I believe it was all in him but I
[1:26:59] believe it all
[1:27:01] here now in the ride
[1:27:06] Dory our form of God and Perfection the
[1:27:10] righteousness to survive we now I change

[1:30:49] can see it so Progressive Revelations
[1:31:08] he heard Jesus for three and a half
[1:31:10] years
[1:31:14] they had a great understanding
[1:31:19] and he opened their understanding of
[1:31:21] himself
[1:31:30] I love you
[1:31:37] I love it any problems what they had
[1:31:41] became alive and they saw him as the
[1:31:44] resurrection in the
