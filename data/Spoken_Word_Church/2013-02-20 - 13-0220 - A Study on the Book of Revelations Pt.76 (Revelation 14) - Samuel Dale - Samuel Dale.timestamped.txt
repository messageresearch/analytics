[5:51] amen Revelations 1 and Revelations
[5:58] 14 the revelation of Jesus Christ which
[6:01] God gave unto him to show unto his
[6:04] servants things which must shortly come
[6:05] to pass and he s and signified by his
[6:08] Angel and to his servant John who by
[6:10] record of the word of God and the
[6:12] testimony of Jesus Christ and of all
[6:14] things that he saw blessed is he that
[6:18] readeth and they that hear the words of
[6:19] this prophecy and keep those things
[6:21] which are written therein for the time
[6:25] is at hand okay we'll go over into
[6:28] Revelations 14
[6:32] 1-5 and I looked and low a lamb stood on
[6:35] Mount Si and with him at 144,000 having
[6:40] his father's name written in their
[6:43] foreheads and I Heard a Voice from
[6:46] Heaven as the voice of many Waters and
[6:50] as the voice of a great Thunder and I
[6:52] heard the voice of great of Harpers
[6:54] harping with their
[6:56] Harps and they sang as it were a new
[7:00] song before the throne and before the
[7:02] four beasts and the elders no man could
[7:05] learn that song but the
[7:07] 144,000 which were redeemed from the
[7:10] earth these are they which were which
[7:13] were not defiled with women for they are
[7:17] virgins these are they which follow the
[7:20] lamb whether soever he
[7:22] goeth these were redeemed from among men
[7:26] being the first fruits unto God and into
[7:30] the L you may be seated
[7:35] here just think about the things now
[7:39] that that we talked
[7:42] about and uh you know where we've been
[7:46] and the
[7:47] things remember in the message prior to
[7:50] this one we were talking about the Seal
[7:54] of
[7:55] God and finding out that that seal of
[7:58] God is the baptism of the Holy Ghost all
[8:01] right and then we look into that and we
[8:04] see that the mark of the
[8:07] beast we found was to reject that Holy
[8:10] Spirit right it's not a hard bad thing
[8:13] to do it's simply just turning down
[8:18] God remember we told about the the man
[8:21] that the Holy Ghost tried to come on he
[8:23] was a pope or whatever you call him
[8:25] there and the Holy Ghost tried to come
[8:27] on him and he wouldn't accept it he was
[8:30] the one that wrote the decree see that
[8:33] it was better to be forced to serve God
[8:36] than it was to do leave you alone so
[8:38] they went out and begin killing they
[8:39] killed 68 million you know
[8:43] Christians naturally speaking and like
[8:45] the prophet said how many billions
[8:47] spiritually right did they kill with
[8:49] their
[8:50] Doctrine cuz where is that Mark of the
[8:53] Beast and what is it it's not a stamp in
[8:55] your forehead of 666 or some form like
[8:58] that of a credit card or a or a you know
[9:03] line of that or certain things it they
[9:05] said it was a number of a
[9:07] man we found that 666 then to be
[9:11] vicarious filad which means instead of
[9:14] God right so the pope declares himself
[9:16] to be instead of God and that's the only
[9:19] city in the world that the Bible says
[9:21] sits on seven heels you know that is a
[9:24] religious form to rule the world is Rome
[9:28] Italy Cincinnati sits on seven heels but
[9:30] it's not a ruling factor of the world in
[9:33] what's called
[9:34] Christianity but we found that seal of
[9:39] God that baptism of the Holy
[9:42] Ghost that remember in uh the Ezekiel
[9:46] the rider's inkhorn I'm just trying to
[9:49] background a little bit and then we'll
[9:50] move up remember the rider's inkhorn
[9:53] where he was told to go through and and
[9:55] mark all of that was to sigh and cry for
[9:57] the Abominations done in the
[10:00] City and see that was in a time that it
[10:04] was not the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[10:06] because you could not receive it because
[10:08] Christ hadn't come but it was in the
[10:10] time of typing what would happen into
[10:15] the real true believers that would sigh
[10:17] and cry for the Abomination done in the
[10:19] city or the wrong that surround them in
[10:21] their churches
[10:23] Etc and praying for the people and that
[10:27] would be back dar see it was a mark in
[10:30] their
[10:31] forehead all right seal those who sigh
[10:34] and cry well then we found out in the
[10:37] Bible it was talking about that these
[10:40] 144,000 would be sealed in their
[10:42] forehead
[10:45] right we found out we would be sealed in
[10:48] our foreheads by the baptism of the Holy
[10:50] Ghost amen not in our head not in our
[10:53] our doings but it would seal Satan out
[10:56] because it would seal in the soul of the
[10:58] individual ual in the New Testament part
[11:01] and sealing in the Kingdom the I I wish
[11:05] we did have a baptism of the Holy Ghost
[11:07] a ceiling of our brain you know our
[11:10] forehead as we call it because what is
[11:12] the mark of the beast the doctrine the
[11:15] ideas the thoughts and we read there
[11:18] where brother rown said it was even just
[11:19] like saying well I believe and I go to
[11:24] church in other words what else do you
[11:26] want besides me going to church and
[11:28] being a good person
[11:29] I want you born again I want you to have
[11:32] the Seal of God Amen and not just in
[11:35] your forehead right but to be in the
[11:38] baptism of the Holy Ghost now the
[11:40] 144,000 doesn't receive it just as an
[11:43] anointing or something in their
[11:46] forehead they receive it as the new
[11:49] birth for their time the hour that
[11:51] they're living but they are sealed by
[11:54] the word of God Amen because remember it
[11:58] was the name
[12:00] or the number of the name you know or
[12:02] the person or whatever and if we have
[12:05] the same Doctrine what is the image to
[12:08] the Beast same Doctrine right if we have
[12:11] the same Doctrine you said but now
[12:13] brother
[12:14] Dale the Baptist the Mist the
[12:17] Presbyterian the Pentecostal Catholics
[12:19] Brites
[12:21] Etc I don't mind making it that
[12:24] way you said they don't all teach the
[12:27] same no you go to a dozen different
[12:29] Baptist churches and you're not going to
[12:31] hear the same message preached but what
[12:34] is the basis of
[12:36] it the basis of it is the
[12:39] trinitarian concept right whether it be
[12:42] explained in many many different ways
[12:45] and different
[12:46] thoughts you know I've heard Baptist
[12:49] preach real good messages on one God
[12:51] right because that's the basic Baptist
[12:54] Doctrine is one true and living God but
[12:57] to explain it is God in three persons
[12:59] Blessed
[13:00] Trinity because they don't know how to
[13:02] explain it right that's right but yet
[13:04] having the same
[13:07] Doctrine see that every church then has
[13:10] got the same Doctrine right anything
[13:12] that you see that it's in Attack of the
[13:15] godhead is like brother dick was talking
[13:17] a while ago when he goes to a church he
[13:19] takes out the Bibles and he looks in
[13:21] them and sees whether or not it attacks
[13:23] first John you know or something like
[13:26] that why because you know that some
[13:28] trans translations change some of those
[13:32] scriptures all right and some churches
[13:35] use those things all right now when you
[13:37] start changing it
[13:39] why your because it doesn't fit your
[13:44] Doctrine and if it doesn't fit your
[13:45] Doctrine you want to change right so you
[13:49] even change translations or or writings
[13:51] you know to make it fit what you're
[13:53] believing right well then you see the
[13:56] people of this message the same way the
[13:59] people of this message this got brother
[14:00] rand's
[14:02] words but
[14:05] yet they got the same
[14:09] concept as the Catholic
[14:11] Church heard just one today that brother
[14:14] Ray was talking about it there it's
[14:16] on something on there I'm not going to
[14:18] say it's on the Internet or stuff but he
[14:21] read it about this brother saying that
[14:23] brother brandom said he was born on
[14:25] April 88th or born April what you know
[14:30] the and instead of the
[14:32] ninth you know more maybe a year before
[14:36] the other and he he don't want to trust
[14:39] him no
[14:41] more well I I'd like to talk to that man
[14:44] for about 5
[14:46] minutes now I wouldn't be talking your
[14:48] way to chew him out you know what I'd be
[14:50] doing I'd just be listening to him
[14:52] because in about 5 minutes you're going
[14:54] to cross
[14:57] yourself you watch people
[14:59] in about 5 minutes you're going to say
[15:01] something hold it you just crossed your
[15:03] head you know so what I told a man one
[15:06] time he said I want to talk to you about
[15:07] the godhead I said okay we'll
[15:09] talk I said but now once you cross the
[15:12] truth I'm going to raise my hand he said
[15:14] all right so he said two words I raised
[15:16] my
[15:17] hand I me honest he had said two
[15:20] words why because he already crossed
[15:23] himself well see you see the people in
[15:25] this message that claim brother around
[15:27] to be a prophet
[15:29] and then trying to tee down the things
[15:32] that he said whether it be dates or
[15:35] whether it be whatever it is you know
[15:38] and and they they're trying to tire that
[15:40] why what's the what's the point what's
[15:43] you're trying to destroy what he
[15:47] said and it's not over the
[15:49] godhead one of the doctrines and the
[15:51] message is not over the godhead right
[15:55] it's over whether he was in a certain
[15:56] place at a certain time or certain yeah
[15:59] right you say well that's not in oh but
[16:01] see the background is
[16:03] what if you can destroy a person's
[16:06] confidence right of the prophet's
[16:08] message and the dates of the times of
[16:10] the seasons whatever you're
[16:12] automatically destroying his doctrine of
[16:14] the godhead I don't give a hoot what you
[16:18] say about how you believe in one true
[16:19] and living
[16:21] God right I did too when I was in the
[16:24] Baptist Church and believed he couldn't
[16:27] stump his toe
[16:29] and hurt
[16:30] himself but then I be to read the Bible
[16:33] and come to find it out I was wrong
[16:36] amen but you see what I'm talking about
[16:38] now Mark of the Beast seal of
[16:42] God the Seal of God is the baptism of
[16:45] the Holy Ghost in your soul which is
[16:47] revealing the revealing of the word
[16:51] right now there's no way to get the B
[16:54] follow me please when I say something
[16:56] listen to the words I say you w internet
[16:58] I listen listen at least to the way I
[17:00] say it don't trick my words with
[17:05] me if you don't have the baptism of the
[17:08] Holy
[17:09] Ghost you're already sealed
[17:13] right with the mark of the beast right
[17:17] right no no okay I knew I had it so the
[17:22] day I just happen to think go ahead
[17:24] brother Joe and pull up number 1 18 and
[17:26] let's just read what brother rown says
[17:28] on you United under one head preached in
[17:31] 1958
[17:35] 326 now what happens you can't stand
[17:38] neutral you got to be filled with
[17:40] something to survive notice you might be
[17:42] filled with one thing over another one
[17:46] another you say brother
[17:48] Rand I'm kind of on that fence on the
[17:52] fence no you're
[17:55] not do you say I just don't
[18:02] understand is that a familiar
[18:05] saying I don't understand what you're
[18:08] saying no you don't want to admit it's
[18:10] right what I'm saying y listen to what
[18:12] he's
[18:14] saying what look the brother said I'm
[18:17] I'm kind of on the fence he said no
[18:19] you're not the Bible plainly says that
[18:22] all that was not sealed with the Holy
[18:24] Ghost receed the mark of the beast all
[18:27] that didn't have the Seal of God in her
[18:29] forehead had the mark of the beast you
[18:32] got one or the other we were
[18:35] born with the mark of the beast
[18:38] right tell me what else you would
[18:41] have come we were born in Satan's
[18:45] domain all right see
[18:48] then you're either sealed in or sealed
[18:51] out right if you're sealed out it's got
[18:53] to be the Antichrist right yeah but
[18:55] brother there what about these people in
[18:57] justification and sanctification in this
[18:59] day now come on over here where I'm at
[19:02] let's don't get back out with brother
[19:03] brand in Luther and Wesley we can talk
[19:05] about that if you want to come on talk
[19:06] to me about it cuz in the days of Luther
[19:09] the just shall live by faith put him in
[19:11] the body of Christ right but it won't
[19:14] put you in there
[19:15] now you got to have the baptism of the
[19:18] Holy Ghost now we'll get to that the
[19:20] Lord willing Sunday on those three
[19:22] angels in the Book of
[19:24] Revelations and their
[19:26] messages all right but you
[19:29] see justification and sanctification
[19:32] today don't put you in the body of
[19:33] Christ they don't give you eternal life
[19:35] that's not the Seal of God
[19:38] right you could be totally justified and
[19:41] Sanctified and still not have the the
[19:44] new bir right or the Seal of God you're
[19:48] in the
[19:52] process all right but just get that
[19:57] point either we're sealed in or we're
[19:59] sealed
[20:00] out one or the other it's not brother
[20:03] R's fault that we're that way right and
[20:08] it's not his problem that he called us
[20:10] in way right we ought to have enough
[20:12] common flat ordinary
[20:15] sense to know what he says is Right amen
[20:19] that's as hard as I can say
[20:22] it I wish I could find Sterner words to
[20:25] make it with but brother d r around and
[20:27] said brother said that bring it on and
[20:30] let's see that's right I'm just I've
[20:32] challenged you out there come on what's
[20:34] the matter right you're so scream every
[20:36] wor else but scream you said Brother D
[20:39] you're not CH I'm not challenge you
[20:40] challenge me right why because you're
[20:43] teaching people contrary to the
[20:48] word see then you're the one that's
[20:50] causing problem not
[20:51] me but you see I'm the one that's
[20:54] blind you think you know everything no
[20:56] but I know somebody that does
[20:59] come let's talk about it all let's see
[21:03] whether it's the Seal of God if you have
[21:05] the baptism of the Holy Ghost you cannot
[21:07] deny the word you want those quotes and
[21:09] Propet that's right that's you tell me
[21:12] you can deny the
[21:14] word and say you got the new
[21:18] birth you say brother around said so and
[21:20] so but I don't believe that by what
[21:25] Authority that put you above him okay
[21:27] get off
[21:30] but now
[21:34] listen the the
[21:37] father's seal in the
[21:40] forehead of I'm making this for a later
[21:43] message all the Seal of God in the
[21:46] forehead of the 144,000 we've explained
[21:50] that is not just in their
[21:52] forehead it's just a statement of ways
[21:54] of doing all right because we're sealed
[21:58] in our forehead if you take it correctly
[22:02] because your conscience and subconscious
[22:04] a working back out through that forehead
[22:07] and if you're sealed in on the inside
[22:09] the outside's going to come to the truth
[22:10] of
[22:12] it but they get the new birth they get
[22:15] the Seal of
[22:16] God they're not the
[22:19] bride is that the way your Prophet said
[22:21] it but they'll be in a millennial R now
[22:24] watch that in a
[22:26] minute how and where is the
[22:30] scriptures where brother randam would
[22:32] say that they're in the millennial R you
[22:33] know where would he get it
[22:35] from remember he's a word
[22:38] Prophet all
[22:40] right but just think about it
[22:44] now they have his name written in their
[22:49] forehead you remember when the first
[22:51] time you was reading in the Bible and
[22:53] somebody begin to talk to you about
[22:54] maybe water baptism in the name of the
[22:56] Lord Jesus Christ and you'd never seen
[22:59] the little name n m too much you know
[23:01] you didn't read that too much but once
[23:04] you started thinking about it just
[23:05] everwhere you turn the old and the new
[23:07] it just always name name name it's like
[23:11] buying you a beautiful purple
[23:16] Buick and nobody has got one like
[23:20] it and you pull out of the dealership in
[23:23] I got one nobody else ain't got one like
[23:26] this one about that time three go by
[23:29] you just didn't see him before right and
[23:32] that's the way it is in the Bible you
[23:34] didn't see it but then once you see it
[23:36] it's just everywhere right see
[23:39] everything you read is name everything
[23:41] you read is related to that well that's
[23:44] the way God does things amen that's the
[23:46] seal in
[23:47] you you realize you're sealed by the
[23:50] revealed
[23:53] word come on right got to go through
[23:56] your forehead to get there to be seal
[23:59] all right I try to get off the seal I
[24:01] want to preach on that okay but now
[24:04] remember the the difference
[24:07] between the
[24:09] Jews in our day and the
[24:15] 144,000 is
[24:19] what not just a baptism of the Holy
[24:22] Ghost an anointing poured
[24:26] out but you read he word right will you
[24:29] agree right right amen that's why that
[24:32] it's the father's doctrine that we
[24:34] always need to make sure we have you
[24:39] know I was hoping today that cuz I said
[24:42] so much about him but I was hoping today
[24:44] those that were at their funeral was
[24:45] watching my
[24:48] brother and listening to
[24:50] him the man is Anointed yeah sure he can
[24:55] hold your attention in he preach
[24:58] messages i' like I've never heard people
[25:01] in this message some them never try to
[25:02] preach you take an Old Testament and
[25:05] type it with a new testament situation
[25:08] and keep you spell bound but I was
[25:10] hoping you would just see what I'm
[25:12] talking about anointing that's
[25:15] right and see how that anointing and
[25:18] just it will lead you right in like that
[25:20] man throw me time up the Carol there
[25:23] said I went to school to learn how to
[25:25] control people
[25:29] he said but you have it by
[25:32] natural I said I have I don't have I I
[25:38] try to preach the word the word's what's
[25:40] got the anointing with it that's what
[25:43] Spell bound to my heart is when I hear
[25:45] somebody preaching the
[25:48] word that raises my heart into a a
[25:51] wonderful situation why because I can
[25:54] talk about that that's part of me wait
[25:57] in a minute till we get down to where it
[25:59] says and they Sayang as it
[26:03] were you don't say this 144,000 sings a
[26:06] new
[26:07] song they sing as it
[26:10] were that's right a new
[26:13] song
[26:15] all but listen
[26:19] Church do we see this message is what
[26:23] sealing you and
[26:25] I we're being sealed in even though we
[26:27] have a new birth look at the Statue of
[26:29] perfect man that is a ceiling in the
[26:34] Kingdom they'll be in the ceiling one
[26:36] day of
[26:37] the The
[26:40] Headstone and when it is you don't have
[26:42] to worry about it then
[26:44] right it may be a short powerful right
[26:48] demonstration the prophet said but he
[26:49] said it'll be
[26:51] here brother Dale are you looking for a
[26:53] great anointing to come yes your Prophet
[26:57] said it would fill every fiber of our
[26:59] beings and take us in the Rapture that's
[27:02] exactly oh you look at the hospital
[27:03] being he didn't say that he said that's
[27:07] not true right he said it never
[27:12] was he said Jesus walked in the greatest
[27:14] anointing ever been and walked by and
[27:16] healed one man that maybe had some poate
[27:19] problem or
[27:21] something they had it 38 years wasn't
[27:24] going to kill
[27:25] him he said he healed a man turn walked
[27:29] out
[27:31] right the greatest
[27:34] anointing took the
[27:37] scriptures and read
[27:39] it handed the Bible back and turned
[27:42] around and sat down is that right right
[27:46] said precious words preceded out of his
[27:49] mouth amen but you know them Pharisees
[27:52] didn't like what come out of that mouth
[27:55] cuz it was ripping them to Pieces right
[27:57] right right it's according to what side
[27:59] you on all right but see the seal in
[28:02] your forehead is the
[28:06] doctrine brother said a church without a
[28:09] Doctrine is not a church that's right
[28:12] two Soul people have a
[28:14] doctr everybody rallies around the
[28:16] doctrine when they get together they you

[28:20] prophet said this here look at this one
[28:21] here one look at this one here look at
[28:23] this one here do we get together about
[28:25] the truth right now
[28:30] right come

[28:36] Adam he said how many sign crying for
[28:39] the Abomination done in the
[28:41] city he said let's get down and see what
[28:43] the real evidence of the Holy Ghost is
[28:45] now I didn't say that your Prophet said
[28:48] it amen yes it
[28:51] is you don't ever it don't ever rip your
[28:54] heart to pieces to hear the people of
[28:57] this message and see how happy they are

[29:12] when to go brother dick and I talk I
[29:14] said you let this next pop come out of
[29:16] the United States you ain't never seen
[29:18] such a Revival is going to be among the
[29:19] people of this message for about 3
[29:22] months and then they're going to realize
[29:24] it ain't
[29:26] working what they done in' 77 come
[29:30] on churches at the end of 76 6 and the
[29:34] end of the 77 and then they gave them a
[29:36] Year's leave of absence you know at the
[29:38] end of 77 they were screaming in holls
[29:41] all
[29:42] over at the beginning of 77 they was
[29:45] saying we're
[29:47] here he had a whole year shouting Glory
[29:50] Hallelujah where are they
[29:55] now right amen am I hateful for saying
[29:59] that if I am I'm sorry for being hateful
[30:02] I'm not sorry for what I said
[30:05] am but now think about it it's in your
[30:11] understanding all right this kingdom is
[30:14] being sealed in these virtues is being
[30:17] sealed in by your
[30:20] understanding amen not just natural
[30:23] understanding but by Holy Ghost amen
[30:25] revealed word amen
[30:27] seals us into the Kingdom
[30:30] right but how many wants to hear the
[30:33] word
[30:35] right but see then are they
[30:39] afraid of the
[30:42] message Brother Don and I talking today
[30:45] about this man I'm not laughing about
[30:47] him but life C thinking the way that
[30:48] people just message
[30:50] you and he told him I preached 75
[30:53] sermons or something out the book of oh
[30:56] that's deep
[30:58] but hurt St one how do you know what I
[31:01] said
[31:03] right I told you you know I tell you
[31:06] things and then finally you'll run into
[31:08] somebody that'll verify it right brother
[31:10] dick they'll wind up and tell you that
[31:12] you ain't a Baptist you ain't going to
[31:15] heav I try to tell you them things and
[31:17] then you go run into
[31:19] them but it don't run into that because
[31:21] I told you people say stay out of the
[31:22] Book of Revelation don't get in Genesis
[31:25] don't get in the Book of Revelation
[31:27] and then somebody preaching oh I ain't
[31:29] going to listen to that oh I'm that's
[31:32] the way let me quote the people of the
[31:33] message I'm not going to listen to that
[31:35] cuz I might get
[31:38] confused
[31:40] right
[31:42] remember we were born confused that's
[31:45] right remember we were born with the
[31:48] mark of the beast that's
[31:52] right yes sir your spirit of the
[31:56] word the man said you remember to
[31:58] brother Brown somebody referring to it
[31:59] just recently said brother Brown said
[32:01] you scare people talking about the Lord
[32:03] coming he said I'm sure's probably
[32:07] stop just Ratt his head you're scared of
[32:10] the coming of the
[32:14] Lord Bo would that be something for me
[32:16] to be overseas somewhere and I'm getting
[32:19] ready to come home in wife oh Lord he'll
[32:22] be here in a little
[32:24] while scared of coming
[32:27] I better stay over there right right all
[32:30] right but now
[32:32] listen let's just take this Revelations
[32:36] 14 but I want to make the statement like
[32:38] I always try to
[32:39] make Revelations at least 7 8 6 7 8 even
[32:46] back and forth parts of five but 6 7 8 9
[32:49] 10 11 12 13 and we're up to 14 it's in a
[32:53] 3 and 1/2 year period
[32:55] right right
[32:57] called a tribulation of Jacob's trouble
[33:00] these things are taking place and what
[33:02] what we're trying to do is just speak
[33:04] about it like we did on the the compound
[33:08] meaning you
[33:10] know and compound
[33:12] Revelation not different meanings not
[33:15] you seeing one God and me seeing three
[33:17] and oh we just both saying the same
[33:20] thing no compound meaning is call my son
[33:25] out of Egypt and Jesus coming out of
[33:28] Egypt right one was was Israel coming up
[33:32] the other one was Jesus deeper meaning
[33:34] or opening of the word when do we get on
[33:36] this I'll say it and then I'll get back
[33:38] to it it says there in Revelation 14
[33:42] they saying as it were
[33:45] right a new
[33:48] song but over in Revelations 5 they said
[33:51] they singing You song that's
[33:55] right well that's
[33:57] Pang different
[34:00] song one of them is the song the other
[34:03] one as the
[34:07] song let we get to that a few
[34:09] minutes let's just take it and just
[34:11] think about
[34:14] it we shouldn't have any problems
[34:18] whatsoever to
[34:21] comprehend what is being said in chapter
[34:24] 14 and verse one I want to pull that
[34:26] back up from where they were reading a
[34:27] while ago let's just go verse by verse
[34:30] just a little
[34:32] bit and just look at
[34:35] it and see what it's actually saying see
[34:39] we don't read
[34:41] it as it's
[34:43] saying we read what we want it to say oh
[34:48] yeah
[34:51] right and I looked and lo a
[34:55] lamb stood on Mount s son that's o n z
[35:01] n and with him
[35:04] 144,000 having his father's name written
[35:08] in the
[35:11] foreheads now listen and pay close
[35:17] attention Mount sign is on
[35:24] Earth you said well Wonder
[35:28] okay and this
[35:31] 144,000 received the
[35:34] father's name a
[35:37] seal written in their foreheads in other
[35:40] words they get the new birth for their
[35:45] time 144,000 receive the Holy Ghost do
[35:48] you need that
[35:52] amen we'll get back and read it in a
[35:54] minute
[35:55] just but look they're on
[36:00] Earth verse one's on Earth verse two is
[36:03] in
[36:08] heaven
[36:14] ready look a lamb stood on that sign on
[36:18] Earth 144,000 we don't have any trouble
[36:22] knowing who this is this is not a
[36:25] symbolics we left a symbolics back into
[36:28] some of the ages and the you know I mean
[36:30] the the seals and the different things
[36:33] you're getting now more to positive
[36:36] statements there's no argument about who
[36:39] this
[36:41] is he doesn't say there's a group of
[36:44] people standing on M sign with the lamb
[36:46] but we don't know who they
[36:49] are it plainly tells you who that is
[36:53] right yep and what they have MH right
[36:57] that they get for their day and their
[37:00] time I keep saying that cuz they're not
[37:01] in the bride of Christ the bride done go
[37:04] in the Rapture in Revelation
[37:08] 4:1 this is Israel in the
[37:12] tribulation not a British Israel
[37:14] doctrine of trying to make it a bride or
[37:16] this that or the
[37:17] other now look at verse
[37:22] two but I want you to read
[37:25] this
[37:28] now you mind if I read it to
[37:34] tricky and I heard voices in
[37:37] heaven as it were a voice of many
[37:44] Waters did I read that wrong yes you
[37:48] did yeah I read that wrong didn't I cuz
[37:51] what it
[37:53] say John on Earth
[37:57] right writing of what he sees on Earth
[38:00] he sees the
[38:02] 144,000
[38:04] sealed on
[38:07] Earth all right and I Heard a
[38:12] Voice from
[38:18] heaven but that's
[38:21] all as of the voice of many Waters now
[38:26] we know what waterers is people
[38:32] right John when he hears this it's so
[38:36] much in unison are are U together so
[38:40] much until he hears one voice
[38:44] right are you reading it y
[38:48] hey he hears one
[38:51] voice in other words but it's in many
[38:55] people
[38:57] cuz they all got the same
[38:59] Revelation you
[39:02] agree that's why it's one
[39:06] voice brother R talking about it in the
[39:09] ages and he said thousands of live
[39:11] voices amen thundering
[39:15] out and there's the voice of a great
[39:21] Thunder he said to bride down Through
[39:23] the Ages thundering out the word of God
[39:27] the revelation of the day they we living
[39:30] in I'm going watch what I'm getting in
[39:33] and I Heard a Voice from heaven on Earth
[39:36] heard it from
[39:38] Heaven a voice it was so much they were
[39:42] all saying the same thing do you
[39:45] understand and then when it comes out
[39:48] then it's what as the voice of many
[39:50] Waters many people saying the same thing
[39:53] that's right okay and as the voice of a
[39:58] great Thunder that comes back to
[40:03] one the Thunder is a voice of God right
[40:07] so the voice of God is sounding through
[40:08] the people until when John hears this
[40:10] it's just one
[40:12] voice you know what he said on
[40:14] Revelation
[40:16] 5 on Revelation 5 he comes down to there
[40:19] he said everything in heaven everything
[40:21] on Earth heard I heard him amen saying
[40:26] it amen right
[40:29] amen and watch and they heard the voice
[40:32] of
[40:33] Harpers harping with
[40:35] hearts were in
[40:39] heaven look what it says and they sang
[40:43] as it were a new
[40:45] song before the
[40:51] throne and before the
[40:54] Beast and the elders
[40:58] and no man could learn that
[41:03] song Amen but the 140 and
[41:07] 4,000 which were the redeemed from the
[41:10] earth
[41:13] okay okay brother Joe pull on up now to
[41:16] Revelations
[41:21] 5 go on up to Revelations
[41:25] 5
[41:27] yeah that was 14 pull up Revelations
[41:30] 5 and I beheld and L in the midst of the
[41:32] Throne of the four beast in the midst of
[41:35] the Elder same situation same groups of
[41:39] people same Throne same four Beast same
[41:43] Elders same
[41:47] lamb which are the seven spirits of God
[41:50] sent forth into all the Earth that's the
[41:51] bride of Christ down Through the Ages
[41:53] right he came and took the book out of
[41:55] right him him that set and when he had
[41:57] taken the book The Four beast and 4 and
[42:01] 20 Elders fell before the lamb having
[42:03] every one of them hearts and golden vs
[42:06] full of oders which are the priers of
[42:08] the
[42:09] Saints this is the bride in heaven you
[42:12] remember Revelations 5 is the bride in
[42:14] heaven the question they asked brother
[42:15] brand he answered it wrong said it was
[42:17] not the bride then he come back and he
[42:19] said that is the bride
[42:21] amen and look what it says in verse n
[42:24] and they sang A new song
[42:30] Amen thou AR worthy to take the
[42:33] book that's what the song
[42:36] saying
[42:40] right the song they're singing this
[42:43] group in Revelations 5 is saying saying
[42:46] Thou Art Worthy to take the book to open
[42:48] the seals to loose
[42:53] amen
[42:55] right
[42:57] they sang a new
[43:00] song so you and I when we're born
[43:06] again I thought we believe we were
[43:08] supposed to sing a new
[43:09] song I thought it was a song of
[43:11] redemption I thought it was the telling
[43:13] the of the word and and the seals to be
[43:16] open and and was slain and and redeemed
[43:19] to God by the blood out of every Kindred
[43:22] I thought it was the Plan of Redemption
[43:24] that we're supposed to be singing
[43:25] abouten
[43:30] yes but why would it say here and they
[43:33] sing a new song which is the
[43:37] bride now go back to Revelation 14 with
[43:40] Y I'm working them at night I told him I
[43:42] said I don't know which way I'm
[43:44] going I said we'll just go amen I don't
[43:48] know which way to go I've got something
[43:49] I want to get off and if I get it off
[43:51] it's going to hurt feelings if I don't
[43:53] get it off it's going to hurt
[43:55] mine
[43:57] I don't mind
[43:58] talking put together with it what you
[44:01] want look what it says and I heard a
[44:04] great Heard a
[44:08] Voice from Heaven as the voice of many
[44:12] people over there they were the voice of
[44:14] singing about the Plan of Redemption
[44:17] right in Revelations 5 now look and they
[44:20] sang as it were a new
[44:23] song before the throne now why would
[44:27] they say as it were a new
[44:29] song why didn't they say then they sing
[44:31] a new
[44:37] song they
[44:40] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[44:45] 144,000 but it does not make them the
[44:47] Bride of Jesus Christ that's right right
[44:50] cuz the bride done gone in Rapture
[44:52] Revelation 4:1 amen Revelation 5 you
[44:56] seen in heaven singing about the
[44:57] Redemption amen I
[45:00] redeemed by love
[45:08] divine when this 144,000 comes up and
[45:11] that's who's doing it right
[45:14] right now come on read it to where it is
[45:16] see if you read up here and look here
[45:18] you like we don't know who's saying it
[45:20] okay read verse three again they saying
[45:22] as it were a new song before the throne
[45:24] and before the four Beast and the elders
[45:26] and no man could learn that song but the
[45:33] 144,000 all
[45:36] right see that's why they don't get the
[45:38] new birth to make them the bride of
[45:43] Christ they get the baptism of the Holy
[45:46] Ghost they get eternal life but they'll
[45:50] never be the bride so they can't
[45:54] sing Our Song amen right you know the
[45:58] foolish virgins who claim the blood of
[46:00] Jesus
[46:01] Christ and claim even
[46:04] sanctification you realize they can't
[46:07] sing the song of the Bride amen
[46:13] right come
[46:18] on they're lock in the ages and
[46:23] things in the days when Martin Lu come
[46:29] along they brought in songs for that
[46:32] day and they begin to write certain
[46:34] songs and bring them in and some of you
[46:37] that are song people you know you you'll
[46:40] know in a hurry what I'm talking about
[46:42] because you know songs were written in a
[46:43] certain times and it was written about
[46:46] the age they were living in and for to
[46:49] help you to understand better you jump
[46:50] over to char and John Wesley and them
[46:53] under sanctification and they wrote of
[46:55] about the blood I know it was the blood
[46:59] I know it was the blood all her songs
[47:01] were related around the blood why
[47:04] because that was the message of the hour
[47:07] right right all the songs in Luther's
[47:10] age was
[47:11] about justification
[47:15] right being free right
[47:20] amen well see then what happened when
[47:22] the zeusa street came along one of the
[47:26] I'm one of them I'm so glad that I can
[47:29] say I'm one of
[47:35] them singing about the name of
[47:39] Jesus
[47:43] right see as the ages change the songs
[47:47] change I'm trying to give you an example
[47:50] to help you understand what they're
[47:51] talking
[47:54] about
[47:56] and they sang songs what about the
[47:59] people of this
[48:02] message they started writing about the
[48:07] token they started writing
[48:10] about ell easier getting a bride for
[48:17] Isaac justification right
[48:22] Joy Justified Justified
[48:27] I Always sung it wrong and I did Brother
[48:29] bis was that time and they trying to
[48:30] sing with me and I sang in other and
[48:32] they sang Canadian and I was saying I
[48:35] never done it in the first place I'm
[48:37] Justified well they couldn't sing it
[48:39] that way cuz it was contrary to their
[48:43] language all right they were saying they
[48:46] never did it in the first
[48:48] place here I am laughing not at them
[48:51] laughing at all of
[48:53] us but listen Church you understand what
[48:55] I
[48:56] mean every age down through have songs
[48:59] for the age related to the message of
[49:02] the
[49:03] hour right look at all the new songs
[49:07] that are out now about the
[49:12] message and look how we'd even take
[49:15] songs that were written in previous ages
[49:19] and upgrade
[49:22] them a band of angels coming after me
[49:27] we
[49:28] say seven angels coming after
[49:33] me I don't know when that song was wrote
[49:35] it wrote for another age
[49:40] right now
[49:42] look it says then in Revelations 5 that
[49:45] they sang a new song it's a song of
[49:47] redemption th aren't worthy you're the
[49:49] lamb you're the one that has done all
[49:51] these things you paid the price
[49:54] mhm
[49:56] yes but when it comes to the Book of
[49:57] Revelations verse chapter
[49:59] 14 it says they sang as it
[50:02] were a new
[50:05] song in other words they sang it as
[50:08] their own Plan of
[50:13] Redemption you realize if the prophet
[50:16] had not give us the Plan of Redemption
[50:18] we would not know no the keys that we
[50:23] know to the Bible that's right you agree
[50:25] right that's
[50:28] right and we wouldn't know and listen
[50:31] folks you can argue with me all you want
[50:32] to I ain't going to argue
[50:34] nobody when I was in the Baptist Church
[50:36] I knew that the Old Testament people
[50:38] didn't have the baptism of the Holy
[50:39] Ghost like the New Testament people
[50:45] had because I was able to
[50:47] read
[50:50] right I naturally couldn't explain it no
[50:52] way no right but I knew it just didn't
[50:56] fit I knew it was two D for groups of
[50:59] people an Old Testament people and a new
[51:02] testament people and I knew if it was a
[51:04] new testament it meant a new covenant
[51:08] not the old covenant made new a New
[51:12] Covenant that's right made through the
[51:14] blood of Jesus Christ so we can sing the
[51:17] song of redemption why because we're the
[51:21] redeemed the Bible said let the redeemed
[51:23] say so amen we can sing it
[51:28] Lord but that 144,000 can't sing that
[51:32] they're
[51:39] bride W
[51:42] be you'd be surprised how many people in
[51:44] this message was Bing over that right
[51:46] now sitting out there on the internet
[51:48] but why don't you
[51:50] study right why don't you read your
[51:52] Bible right well I not get confused no
[51:56] you already
[51:59] are you
[52:02] understand this 144,000
[52:07] sings a
[52:10] song now I didn't write this
[52:13] book did you read it off of there do we
[52:15] need to pull it back up where it says in
[52:17] that 144,000 was the only one that could
[52:21] sing this
[52:24] song that's why it's called as it were a
[52:28] new
[52:29] song see we don't sing about being
[52:36] servants we don't sing about being
[52:44] uni we sing about being the children of
[52:46] God
[52:49] Amen you see Israel can't sing to say
[52:52] that they're the
[52:54] bride so it's
[52:56] as the same song that made the
[52:59] Redemption over here the same one that
[53:01] paid the price at Calvary for you and I
[53:04] to give us that new song of redemption
[53:06] is the same one that gives them their
[53:09] they're doing right I get time I'll get
[53:12] back to the scripture on it in a
[53:16] minute listen
[53:22] Church they saying as it were
[53:27] y a new
[53:39] song What About Your
[53:41] Song what are you say that's
[53:49] right
[53:52] right why is it sister Gil that you used
[53:54] to sing in a choir not a Christian
[53:59] choir but one day they was got to
[54:02] singing a song
[54:03] that there's some verses in there that
[54:06] she Trinity that she couldn't sing
[54:11] why because she knew that that wasn't
[54:15] right right that's simple that's
[54:18] bringing Christianity right down in
[54:20] their
[54:22] lives but you couldn't sing what they
[54:24] sang you think it bothered the rest of
[54:27] them they said
[54:30] Trinity oh they could just pict your
[54:33] voices out of this
[54:37] beautiful that's
[54:41] what lady said one day told her daughter
[54:44] said brother Dale don't believe in the
[54:47] Holy
[54:48] Trinity I said that's exactly right
[54:51] because the Trinity word not in the
[54:52] Bible I don't believe in no Holy Trinity
[54:55] cuz there ain't no Holy Trinity there's
[54:57] a holy God revealed in many
[54:59] manifestations but not a Holy
[55:02] Trinity there's a God in three
[55:04] manifestation but not a God in three
[55:06] persons that's
[55:11] right and you know that
[55:14] that puts us together where she couldn't
[55:16] sing that
[55:18] song cuz there was something inside of
[55:20] here says that ain't right the Lord
[55:24] that's right that ain't
[55:27] right see then you sang a new
[55:33] song see I can sing praise Father Son
[55:37] and Holy
[55:39] Ghost and just don't put the rest of the
[55:42] words to it right
[55:47] right I just don't do the rest of the
[55:51] song well because I'm singing a new song
[55:55] right amen right
[55:58] amen there in this message don't wrote a
[56:01] song about i s a new song
[56:05] yeah but now
[56:10] listen I want to get something right
[56:21] here even to verse four
[56:26] say these are they which were not
[56:28] defiled with
[56:31] women but they
[56:33] virgins these are they which follow the
[56:35] lamb whether soever he
[56:40] goth these were the redeemed from among
[56:42] men yep look being the first
[56:51] fruits that's why people thought that
[56:53] was a bride see when you say first
[56:55] fruits first fruits is referring to the
[56:57] bride
[56:58] right we're the first fruits where're
[57:01] his offspring we're the first
[57:04] fruits that's why we're the we have to
[57:07] be in the resurrection it's the first
[57:09] fruits
[57:11] right but here's talking about this
[57:17] 144,000 they're the first fruits under
[57:20] God they're the redeem from among
[57:23] men they follow the whatsoever he
[57:27] goe now I won't get there know CU done
[57:31] run that too far AR we get to it Sunday
[57:35] about the Unix and the things
[57:38] and I I think we're missing out a lot
[57:40] too A whole
[57:41] lot
[57:47] but these people can sing a song that
[57:50] even we don't sing
[57:53] right what do you mean they strangle
[57:56] about Redemption we strangle about
[57:59] Redemption Martin Luther couldn't
[58:06] sing they were gathered in the upper
[58:09] room all praying in his name baptized
[58:12] with the Holy Ghost and Powerful service
[58:14] came now what he did for them that day
[58:16] he'll do for you to sign I'm so glad
[58:18] that I can say I'm one of them Luther
[58:20] didn't write that song the people that
[58:22] day didn't sing like that
[58:26] why because the Plan of Redemption
[58:28] wasn't revealed Right Wesley come along
[58:31] with sanctification the blood was
[58:33] revealed they even taught the S really
[58:36] true T just sanctification is actually
[58:39] teaching that you're saved by the
[58:40] literal compound of the blood that's why
[58:42] brother R said that's not that's not
[58:44] correct right but that's what they
[58:48] believed that it was a literal
[58:52] compound brother said no it was a life
[58:54] in the blood that's right the Westland
[58:58] never Tau you had to go get a drop of
[59:00] Jesus's blood don't get me all
[59:02] confused I born enough in
[59:05] that Western them I ain't saying they
[59:08] went out there you know and T that it
[59:10] was the drop of blood dropped on each
[59:12] person brother ROM had enough sense and
[59:14] didn't say something like
[59:16] that it was their mind that was linked
[59:20] to the doctrine and the thought that it
[59:22] was the blood that saved right and they
[59:26] had plenty of scripture for her right MH
[59:28] that's
[59:30] right we see it's because the word
[59:32] wasn't revealed right so they couldn't
[59:35] sing the songs we sing today right amen
[59:39] that's
[59:41] right they can't sing
[59:44] that
[59:46] why cuz it wasn't a song of their
[59:52] day you notice here
[59:55] it ever so often I change the theme song
[59:58] we're not just the regular one who uses
[1:00:00] you know and I'm throw off on nobody
[1:00:03] heav help and I forget it but a lot of
[1:00:05] the church people follows of the message
[1:00:07] singing like only believe or you know or
[1:00:11] they'll sing Amazing Grace or whatever
[1:00:13] they're seeing theme song the theme song
[1:00:15] Here is changed when I see a change in
[1:00:18] understanding right so that's why we're
[1:00:20] singing and have been for years now what
[1:00:23] Open the Eyes of My Heart
[1:00:26] Lord right Open the Eyes of My Heart
[1:00:29] amen you know that's just as real as
[1:00:31] reading
[1:00:32] Revelations 1 1 to 3
[1:00:36] 77
[1:00:39] times cuz that's what we've
[1:00:43] done you see that song hit me and when
[1:00:47] it did I said that's what I want Lord I
[1:00:48] want my eyes
[1:00:52] open to the truth
[1:00:55] amen I want to see the truth yes
[1:00:59] sir you see they saying as it
[1:01:03] were a new
[1:01:09] song look back up brother
[1:01:12] Joe but I want to make sure you get the
[1:01:14] point Revelation
[1:01:17] 14 and brother Anderson excuse
[1:01:23] me verse
[1:01:32] one 144,000 lamb standing on
[1:01:37] Earth they get redeemed that's the only
[1:01:41] way they know the song right you go
[1:01:44] along with that
[1:01:46] amen the only way they would know as it
[1:01:48] were a new song is for them to get
[1:01:50] converted
[1:01:52] amen God if not they would sing
[1:01:56] something about the Old Testament you
[1:02:00] know CU they sing for everything like
[1:02:03] brother d s pigy on wife Pig there when
[1:02:06] we was in Israel I got it written in my
[1:02:08] Bible they sang like certain scriptures
[1:02:11] as they entered the temple and moving up
[1:02:14] I'd love to been there heard that right
[1:02:17] moving
[1:02:21] up but wouldn't it be odd to what
[1:02:24] everybody body else would hear they
[1:02:25] would hear do you understand what I mean
[1:02:27] you step up one time you saying one of
[1:02:30] them one of
[1:02:32] them and then you step
[1:02:36] up I know it was the blood no we sing
[1:02:40] all them songs now and he step up you
[1:02:43] know the one that got on number one back
[1:02:45] there he's singing one of
[1:02:48] them it sound like chaos wouldn't
[1:02:51] it every step you take up you'd start a
[1:02:53] new song but the people coming up the
[1:02:55] steps they start on that first
[1:02:58] song it's not the whole group of people
[1:03:00] that's what I thought the Lord this
[1:03:02] would be Mass
[1:03:04] confusion if it wasn't knowing within my
[1:03:07] heart what they were doing when you step
[1:03:09] up on step one you say I'm one of them
[1:03:13] you move up I know it was the
[1:03:16] blood the guy behind me steps up and say
[1:03:19] one of them it wouldn't be Mass
[1:03:23] confusion I know I'm carnal I know
[1:03:26] it you ever thought about God listening
[1:03:28] to all of our prayers
[1:03:33] yes you don't never think like that I
[1:03:35] mean maybe I'm the only dumb one in the
[1:03:38] crowd I
[1:03:40] guess you know what really did get me
[1:03:42] one time George Washington on his knees
[1:03:45] at Valley
[1:03:47] Forge praying for God to help his
[1:03:53] army
[1:03:55] Jackson which one who was the other
[1:03:58] one the
[1:04:01] South Stone Wall Jackson pray him Lord
[1:04:05] help me in my
[1:04:07] folks now who would you answer if he was
[1:04:13] God come on I know maybe I'm just done
[1:04:16] the way I think I know that but I just
[1:04:19] think about that and I think Lord but
[1:04:22] you know
[1:04:23] what he heard what Washington said and
[1:04:26] he took care of some of those people
[1:04:28] someone got blowed
[1:04:30] away he heard what Jackson said on the
[1:04:33] other side and he took care of some of
[1:04:34] those people the others got blowed
[1:04:36] away you understand yes he hears our
[1:04:43] prayers he hears me thank you but
[1:04:51] look Revelation 141
[1:04:54] one is on Earth getting sealed into the
[1:04:58] body you know what you would call it for
[1:05:00] them with the eternal life of their
[1:05:04] age and riding in their foreheads just
[1:05:06] like it's in
[1:05:08] ours then John I Heard a Voice from
[1:05:16] heaven
[1:05:20] now this group on
[1:05:23] Earth
[1:05:26] finally gets
[1:05:29] killed you go along with it you agree
[1:05:32] 144,000 are killed right
[1:05:36] right see they're not up here until they
[1:05:38] get killed here
[1:05:46] right then John he hears a
[1:05:51] voice it's up in heaven
[1:05:59] he sees all of these Throne same as
[1:06:04] Revelations
[1:06:06] 5 he sees the four Beast same as
[1:06:09] Revelations
[1:06:11] 5 he sees the elders the 24 Elders same
[1:06:14] as Revelations
[1:06:18] 5 now he's up in
[1:06:23] heaven
[1:06:24] see that 144,000 will have to be raised
[1:06:27] one
[1:06:31] day if not how are they going to get in
[1:06:33] the Millennium cuz they are killed
[1:06:36] right and they have to wind up in the
[1:06:39] Millennium was your Prophet said to
[1:06:45] do but I wish you would understand
[1:06:49] me and people listening would understand
[1:06:53] the way I do
[1:06:56] I try to preach I know the word
[1:06:59] Progressive is not supposed to be even a
[1:07:01] word but I like it myself because I I
[1:07:05] mean it as today I see this tomorrow I
[1:07:09] want to progress up further I want to
[1:07:11] increase and go on into and walk into
[1:07:14] and keep on going you know I call it
[1:07:17] partial realization the perfect
[1:07:19] realization whatever it's
[1:07:22] doing but you see the same ones are
[1:07:26] guarded in Revelations
[1:07:28] 5 so that means this group of people is
[1:07:31] taken up to
[1:07:40] heaven here they alive on Earth we know
[1:07:42] they got to be killed here they in
[1:07:47] heaven that shouldn't be hard to
[1:07:49] understand if you to read
[1:07:51] it cuz the same scene of Revel 5 is the
[1:07:54] same scene of Revelations
[1:08:02] 14 they're killed and they go to
[1:08:09] heaven you when I think you just killed
[1:08:12] and go into the Millennium I would
[1:08:14] advise you to try to pick up a little
[1:08:16] bit on that as you maybe the thinking to
[1:08:20] understand they're going to go to heaven
[1:08:21] before they go to the
[1:08:22] millennium
[1:08:27] right everybody else is going why not
[1:08:30] let them go right right now I'm going to
[1:08:33] say something that I told you I would
[1:08:35] eventually get back
[1:08:43] to you see this has always been a
[1:08:45] confusing statement to
[1:08:49] me understand the four
[1:08:52] Beast understand understand the
[1:08:55] lamb understand the
[1:08:58] 144,000 understand the singings and the
[1:09:01] doings but I don't understand how that
[1:09:04] there's 24 Elders in
[1:09:06] heaven in Revelations
[1:09:21] 5 maybe you do
[1:09:25] I'd like you to explain it to
[1:09:29] me cuz I 24
[1:09:34] Elders I thought we understood it to be
[1:09:37] the 12
[1:09:38] apostles and the 12
[1:09:41] Patriarchs
[1:09:45] right I thought that was our
[1:09:50] understanding and I can understand the
[1:09:52] 12 apostles getting up in to Heaven
[1:09:54] can't you the Rapture that's no problem
[1:09:57] right right
[1:10:00] mhm but how's that 12 Patriarchs get
[1:10:16] there and according to my
[1:10:19] understanding now if I'm wrong show
[1:10:22] me that if the 12 apostles represented
[1:10:26] the
[1:10:30] bride you know the whole bride right
[1:10:34] then the 12 Patriarchs would represent
[1:10:37] Israel right
[1:10:49] MH how did they get
[1:10:52] there
[1:10:59] right he said well this happened and
[1:11:01] that happens we got the scripture back
[1:11:02] here where the Old Testament Saints
[1:11:11] raised but if the Old Testament
[1:11:16] raised and went up to
[1:11:20] heaven where did he
[1:11:22] go
[1:11:25] that's all I want to
[1:11:27] know because according to my
[1:11:29] understanding they're right there in
[1:11:31] chapter
[1:11:37] 5 but according to my
[1:11:41] understanding the 12 apostles in chapter
[1:11:51] 5 it would have to mean after the
[1:11:53] Rapture
[1:11:56] some word this comes together
[1:12:01] right you don't know what's in my
[1:12:06] heart but all I want to know is how they
[1:12:08] got there where they got to where those
[1:12:11] Old Testament signs go
[1:12:22] to
[1:12:25] where did Enoch
[1:12:35] go where did Elijah
[1:12:40] go where did Moses
[1:12:43] goz brother said Moses didn't die right
[1:12:47] he said the PA barar come picked him up
[1:12:50] he said that's why they couldn't find a
[1:12:51] body right
[1:12:54] right where did the Old Testament Saints
[1:12:57] Go when they
[1:12:58] raised where did Enoch go or where did
[1:13:00] Elijah
[1:13:03] go you say well the Old Testament Saints
[1:13:06] raised with Jesus in the first Rapture
[1:13:09] of the New Testament that's exactly
[1:13:15] right you say now wait a minute no
[1:13:17] you're wrong well you go read your
[1:13:18] rapture me iin got time preach on
[1:13:22] it the Old Testament saints went up with
[1:13:25] Jesus which is the first resurrection in
[1:13:26] the New Testament you better explain
[1:13:28] that real good to me careful because
[1:13:31] according to my understanding Jesus went
[1:13:34] up two
[1:13:37] times
[1:13:39] right Jesus raised and came up and said
[1:13:43] Mary don't touch me I've not yet
[1:13:47] ascended I go to your father and my
[1:13:52] father and then 30 40 days later
[1:13:57] on M went
[1:14:02] up irregardless of where the Old
[1:14:04] Testament
[1:14:06] Saints how they raised where did they
[1:14:10] go you don't know what this is doing to
[1:14:16] me but I
[1:14:21] me I'm not on
[1:14:24] nobody I just want to know
[1:14:27] amen you see one the Old Testament
[1:14:29] saints went up with
[1:14:30] Jesus
[1:14:35] amen but where did they go is there a
[1:14:38] place provided for
[1:14:40] them
[1:14:43] somewhere where did you
[1:14:50] go all right let's back up a little bit
[1:14:55] where did Enoch go before the blood of
[1:14:57] Jesus Christ was shed
[1:15:01] Right Where did Elijah
[1:15:07] go you remember they the charot you
[1:15:10] remember the two raptures in the Old
[1:15:11] Testament you remember right Enoch and
[1:15:16] Elijah this put Moses in there is
[1:15:20] a Aid to help
[1:15:24] and we come to find out that Moses and
[1:15:27] Elijah comes back with Jesus on the
[1:15:30] Mount of transfiguration
[1:15:32] right and brother Brown says that was in
[1:15:35] theophany right
[1:15:41] right were they there with Jesus in
[1:15:44] physical corpal
[1:15:52] bodies I could change
[1:16:00] it where did they
[1:16:02] go that's all I want to
[1:16:07] know if you take them up physically
[1:16:10] where are you going to take them to
[1:16:12] right
[1:16:14] right listen folks this ain't no new
[1:16:17] thing to me right I've been studying
[1:16:19] this for 40
[1:16:21] years I know the quotes brother Bram
[1:16:25] gave that they raised in Mortal bodies I
[1:16:29] know the quotes he said of Enoch even
[1:16:32] raising an a mortal
[1:16:34] body I mean CH Rapture
[1:16:37] off I just think we're missing raptures
[1:16:40] and things we're just making it what we
[1:16:42] want it to
[1:16:45] be that's all I ask is where did he
[1:16:51] go was there a special place that the
[1:16:53] Old Testament saints went up to to stay
[1:16:55] until it's all over with and then they
[1:16:56] wind up in the Millennium which I
[1:16:58] believe they will be in the Millennium
[1:16:59] amen I believe the Old Testament Saints
[1:17:02] now not everybody
[1:17:05] right I believe 144,000 I've talked to
[1:17:08] you that will be in the Millennium the
[1:17:10] prophet says that I believe the fal Jew
[1:17:13] will be in the Millennium
[1:17:16] amen don't have to go to the white
[1:17:18] Throne that's right M that's right now
[1:17:21] not every Israelite because there going
[1:17:23] to be a white Throne judgment that will
[1:17:25] be judgment brought down upon a lot of
[1:17:26] the Jews for the rejecting of Jesus
[1:17:28] Christ amen that's
[1:17:31] right where did it
[1:17:33] go see we study the message and we say
[1:17:36] they were here they would do this and
[1:17:37] that but do we keep on studying
[1:17:41] it run around at the same time that he
[1:17:46] says that the Old Testament Saints
[1:17:48] raised in Mortal Corporal physical
[1:17:52] bodies
[1:17:59] H say it one
[1:18:01] day Adam will reach over and touch Eve
[1:18:05] and Eve Eve will touch Seth and Seth
[1:18:07] will tou abble say even comes down to
[1:18:12] Abraham and there'll be a
[1:18:16] resurrection in the great Rapture
[1:18:18] message that we talking about I got it
[1:18:20] right here if you want
[1:18:24] he said one of these days there'll be a
[1:18:25] BL from
[1:18:27] heaven and said those Old Testament
[1:18:29] Saints will
[1:18:31] raise and go
[1:18:34] up and we will fall right in
[1:18:39] line and go up with
[1:18:51] him
[1:18:57] brother randam where did those Old
[1:18:59] Testament Saints go
[1:19:08] to he said the gate swung open and he
[1:19:11] cured him into the
[1:19:13] city even because it's a new
[1:19:17] city well it they go straight into the
[1:19:19] future
[1:19:21] home and is that the new city he's
[1:19:23] talking
[1:19:32] about it's very odd he made some
[1:19:34] statements in there that is left
[1:19:39] unturned you know what I mean
[1:19:44] unnoticed he said when Jesus raised and
[1:19:46] took those Old Testament Saints he said
[1:19:48] he went straight to the father I'm
[1:19:50] paraphrasing it so I'll be glad to give
[1:19:52] you all of
[1:20:00] he said father is
[1:20:05] finished he said climb up on the throne
[1:20:08] and sit
[1:20:12] down until I make your enemies your foot
[1:20:21] stol
[1:20:27] that's Revelations
[1:20:30] 5 when he climbs up on the Drone and
[1:20:33] sits
[1:20:34] down it's Revelations
[1:20:38] 5 right so we know where Jesus went
[1:20:43] to he went to Revelations
[1:20:49] 5 and he sits there until it's all
[1:20:51] finished and it's all almost 2,000 years
[1:20:53] or over 2,000
[1:20:57] years you remember I were emphasizing
[1:21:00] while ago
[1:21:01] that on Earth 144,000 then had to be
[1:21:04] killed and then here they wind up in
[1:21:05] heaven this two verses later they're in
[1:21:08] heaven
[1:21:09] rejoicing with as it were a new
[1:21:19] song so I could see where they went to
[1:21:22] they went
[1:21:23] to Revelations
[1:21:25] 5 that's why there's 24 Elders in
[1:21:28] Revelations
[1:21:32] 5 we only dealt with the bride of Christ
[1:21:34] being in Revelations
[1:21:39] 5 there's 24 Elders
[1:21:42] there that means it's 12 Apostles and 12
[1:21:46] Patriarchs so now in Revelations 5
[1:21:49] you've got not only the
[1:21:51] bride
[1:21:56] you got the Jews there
[1:22:01] too the real chosen Israel not all here
[1:22:04] okay
[1:22:06] right and as it's
[1:22:14] there then they can come back into the
[1:22:18] Millennium after the marriage
[1:22:21] supper
[1:22:24] see the Jews can come into the
[1:22:26] Millennium
[1:22:31] then but according to my
[1:22:34] understanding when Jesus was told there
[1:22:37] now we know it's not in the scriptures
[1:22:39] as far as a
[1:22:41] quote said he said cown upon the throne
[1:22:43] and sit
[1:22:44] down till I make your enemy is your
[1:22:47] foottoo
[1:22:48] I always thought The Last Enemy to be
[1:22:50] destroyed is death right
[1:22:56] is that scripture do you need a
[1:22:58] scripture for it that's the scripture
[1:23:00] Last Enemy be destroyed is death then it
[1:23:03] can be said you know mortal and in
[1:23:06] my you see brother R says it like this
[1:23:08] he said we're still
[1:23:11] dying so death is death was conquered at
[1:23:16] Calvary don't misunderstand me
[1:23:19] please but it wasn't appli that c
[1:23:24] to the Redemption of this body that's
[1:23:26] right to be applied in the last
[1:23:29] days that's where ene their enemy will
[1:23:32] be
[1:23:34] death be
[1:23:39] destroyed he said but I've got the quote
[1:23:41] for
[1:23:47] this says
[1:23:50] job stood right there in
[1:23:55] Jerusalem in a Corporal
[1:23:59] body CU he had said I'll see my
[1:24:04] redeemer but you better read brother
[1:24:09] Brown he
[1:24:14] said
[1:24:16] job said in the last days he said the
[1:24:20] last 2,000 years
[1:24:23] job said I'll stand on the
[1:24:29] earth the church I know what this has
[1:24:31] costed me you
[1:24:34] don't most of you know nothing about
[1:24:37] what I'm talking about
[1:24:41] but it's cost it in my
[1:24:46] heart you see I have to say what I
[1:24:49] believe
[1:24:51] amen
[1:24:54] and if I can't see something I'm just
[1:24:56] going to tell you I can't see it and I'm
[1:24:58] going to tell you I'm not saying you're
[1:25:01] wrong I told Paul Jones that and talk to
[1:25:04] too doctor I said I'm not going to tell
[1:25:06] you you're wrong I'm going to tell you I
[1:25:08] can't see what she's talking about well
[1:25:10] you know what that meant to me I
[1:25:11] couldn't see what he's talking
[1:25:17] about you know the one that started two
[1:25:19] so
[1:25:21] doctor but listen
[1:25:25] Church you got to get everybody in
[1:25:28] Revelations
[1:25:33] 5 because Revelations 5 shows the
[1:25:40] bride Revelations 14 brother R said is
[1:25:44] perfect traval
[1:25:47] order which is a millennial
[1:25:51] reign
[1:25:54] that's his
[1:25:57] word he said Ezekiel Saw the 40 to 44 of
[1:26:02] the Millennium temple being built on
[1:26:05] Earth and he said Ezekiel Saw Israel in
[1:26:08] perfect tribal order that Dan and
[1:26:11] Ephraim will be put back
[1:26:13] in making it like it was supposed to be
[1:26:16] he said Revelations 14 is the tribal
[1:26:21] order so in Revelations 14 you got
[1:26:27] 144,000 which means Dan and Ephraim is
[1:26:30] back
[1:26:33] in Revelation 7 you got 144,000 with Dan
[1:26:38] and for
[1:26:44] missing you see I believe Israel is
[1:26:46] going to be in the
[1:26:47] Millennium I believe they're going to
[1:26:49] precede us and that 144,000 is going to
[1:26:51] come back right and that Israel is going
[1:26:54] to come and they're going to have a
[1:26:55] millennium temple built cuz you and I
[1:26:57] are the anointing to the temple we don't
[1:26:58] come back to build a temple we come back
[1:27:01] as the anointed to
[1:27:07] right who would know better how to build
[1:27:09] a millennium Temple than Moses yeah
[1:27:13] right God started off it would know
[1:27:17] better right but you
[1:27:20] see I'm just to make this statement and
[1:27:23] I'm going to
[1:27:24] hush if we believe the Old Testament
[1:27:27] Saints raised in a glorified
[1:27:32] body and you're saying well brother
[1:27:34] brandham I've
[1:27:35] got probably 50 quotes the brother Brown
[1:27:39] that says they were raised in a Corporal
[1:27:41] body or did rais in a Corporal
[1:27:44] body but because of the other statements
[1:27:47] he
[1:27:49] made then I make a statement
[1:27:53] if the 144 th if
[1:27:56] the if the Old Testament Saints raised
[1:27:59] when Jesus did
[1:28:01] physically
[1:28:04] corporately with eternal life Body
[1:28:06] Spirit and
[1:28:13] soul then Paul was wrong
[1:28:19] right when he said our last enemy is
[1:28:21] death
[1:28:23] because they would have already
[1:28:25] destroyed
[1:28:31] death are you listening not what you
[1:28:33] agree with me or
[1:28:35] not see if the Old Testament saints went
[1:28:38] into immortality in the resurrection
[1:28:40] with Jesus
[1:28:43] then physical death is
[1:28:46] destroyed
[1:28:51] right
[1:28:55] you see according to my Bible it
[1:28:59] says in Hebrews
[1:29:02] 40 comes all the way down talking about
[1:29:05] the Old Testament Saints even names them
[1:29:07] Abraham he would named all of
[1:29:11] them in Hebrews 11 4 11 excuse me not
[1:29:16] 41 comes down naming the Old Testament
[1:29:18] Saints and you really even got to be
[1:29:20] very picky to find the bride of Christ
[1:29:22] in Revelations 11 you know brother
[1:29:25] random has to define those scriptures
[1:29:27] because the basis of coming down and it
[1:29:30] states it twice in that that having not
[1:29:34] received the
[1:29:37] promise or some better thing for
[1:29:41] us that they without us cannot be made
[1:29:49] perfect you see Church it wouldn't be
[1:29:51] them waiting on on
[1:29:54] us it be the fact that they done gone
[1:29:56] and we done missed
[1:30:03] it you don't
[1:30:05] know one day you
[1:30:09] will you see I love
[1:30:12] everybody but when I preach I preach
[1:30:14] when I believe amen if it's wrong I can
[1:30:18] be
[1:30:20] corrected
[1:30:25] I don't have no
[1:30:27] problems I've never told you here at all
[1:30:30] to never listen to
[1:30:37] nobody have ever told any of you not to
[1:30:40] listen to nobody I mean anybody always
[1:30:43] told you listen to who you want to but
[1:30:45] what was
[1:30:47] mistak but if you bring back here what
[1:30:50] somebody else said then I approach it
[1:30:52] from here right I tell you then what I
[1:30:56] believe and why I believe
[1:30:58] it well that's what I
[1:31:04] done so you see I'm not the only
[1:31:08] answer I'm question I
[1:31:13] guess I want to know some
[1:31:16] answers
[1:31:20] amen
[1:31:23] I want to know where those Old Testament
[1:31:24] saints
[1:31:26] went if they just didn't go up in
[1:31:29] Revelations
[1:31:30] 5 and Revelations
[1:31:33] 5 I'm going ahead and put it here
[1:31:36] because it will fit totally perfectly if
[1:31:39] people would understand it Revelations 5
[1:31:42] is just
[1:31:44] prior to the Millennium fixing to be set
[1:31:47] up that's right
[1:31:49] amen because there is the marriage
[1:31:57] supper old brother Tatum used to quote
[1:32:00] this a
[1:32:02] lot and I love little Tatum so you know
[1:32:06] that so I wouldn't try to destroy
[1:32:08] anything we used to quote something and
[1:32:11] he said it's in the Bible that we're
[1:32:13] going to set at that welcome table
[1:32:15] Abraham Isaac and
[1:32:20] Jacob
[1:32:23] I believe that 1 million
[1:32:26] per you understand I believe that but
[1:32:29] ain't no
[1:32:32] scripture ain't no scripture says we'll
[1:32:34] sit down to welcome table meaning the
[1:32:38] marriage
[1:32:42] supper but I believe we
[1:32:45] will I believe at that marriage supper
[1:32:47] there's going to be a bride spread
[1:32:49] out and there's going to be 144,000 they
[1:32:53] wither at the marriage
[1:32:56] supper there's going to be a fifth seal
[1:32:59] Jew at the marriage supper there's going
[1:33:01] to be all the Old Testament saints that
[1:33:03] it spoke of many of them the Bible says
[1:33:07] not
[1:33:09] everybody will be at that marriage
[1:33:11] supper be welcome
[1:33:16] guest and when we come into the
[1:33:18] Millennium we look at this 144,000 as
[1:33:21] being
[1:33:24] servants what do you
[1:33:28] mean what do you mean I mean they
[1:33:31] waiting on me to get the plate to do
[1:33:33] this I want to that the
[1:33:36] scripture yeah I want brother around
[1:33:42] message we make them
[1:33:45] servants
[1:33:46] right the Bible givs them on honorable
[1:33:50] position that's right
[1:33:52] right y not be surprised and I read a
[1:33:55] scripture to you Lord within
[1:33:57] Sunday that to show you what God thinks
[1:34:01] of the
[1:34:05] Unix we see we think of Unix is all
[1:34:08] being sterile
[1:34:16] people you brother said they
[1:34:20] were
[1:34:22] we think of Unix as being sterile as not
[1:34:25] being able to father
[1:34:32] children only thing I'd like for you to
[1:34:34] answer me one thing cuz that brother
[1:34:37] told me that one time I just I'm sorry
[1:34:39] sorry for being ha
[1:34:41] people I just asked a simple question
[1:34:43] cuz a brother told me one time he said
[1:34:45] or told us
[1:34:47] here he said
[1:34:50] Joseph was made a
[1:34:53] unic when he was sold down there to
[1:34:55] potier so potier wouldn't have put him
[1:34:58] over his wife as a guard if he'll
[1:35:00] still you know a
[1:35:07] man I only had one
[1:35:13] question how did Joseph wind up with
[1:35:15] Piper's wife wanting
[1:35:18] him come
[1:35:20] on a sterile unit and she wanted him and
[1:35:24] you know what she
[1:35:27] wanted she said come and lay with
[1:35:32] me and I asked the brother a simple
[1:35:35] question I said according to my
[1:35:37] understanding I thought Joseph father
[1:35:39] two children that's
[1:35:40] right right I didn't say that then the
[1:35:44] might not order say this tonight but I'm
[1:35:45] going to say
[1:35:49] it if Joseph was castrated and made
[1:35:53] sterile they must have had a great
[1:35:55] restoration process back there right you
[1:36:00] might not like that language but I'm
[1:36:02] blunt because I'm just making how silly
[1:36:05] it is they must have had a restoration
[1:36:08] process because he fed at least two
[1:36:12] children but you see we don't even know
[1:36:14] the Bible
[1:36:16] right I ought to make the statement then
[1:36:18] just go home order to say it like this
[1:36:20] you know that Apostle Paul was a
[1:36:31] unic the Bible says there's Unix that
[1:36:33] are made of man there are Unix that are
[1:36:35] born Unix right but some are Unix for
[1:36:38] the kingdom of God Paul said I got a
[1:36:41] right to get married but said I
[1:36:46] won't in that sense Paul was a
[1:36:50] unic
[1:36:52] I've ever even heard people talk about
[1:36:53] Unix couldn't carry the gospel well
[1:36:55] according to my Bible in Acts you'll
[1:36:57] find who was it which one Philip went
[1:36:59] down to the Ethiopian unit and that
[1:37:02] Ethiopian unit was one that carried the
[1:37:03] gospel where was it India or which
[1:37:07] Ethiopia where Ethiopia
[1:37:11] Ethiopia C the gospel down there and he
[1:37:14] probably was a stir unic that ain't got
[1:37:17] nothing to do with preaching other words
[1:37:18] they said preachers can't be preachers
[1:37:20] they got
[1:37:21] you know
[1:37:26] ability C
[1:37:29] cor
[1:37:31] cor
[1:37:35] right Paul said some men have made Unix
[1:37:38] for the kingdom of God they made
[1:37:40] themselves Unix they become sterile to
[1:37:42] themselves Paul said it was better that
[1:37:44] a man to not marry right but he said
[1:37:47] some can't contain this it's then go
[1:37:49] ahead and get married but he said if you
[1:37:50] can believe this remain as I am you know
[1:37:54] what a brother told me he said Paul was
[1:37:57] married said he had to be married to be
[1:38:00] in a Sanhedrin I said don't give who
[1:38:01] what the Sanhedrin is anyway because it
[1:38:03] all messed
[1:38:06] up I'm honest that's just where I said
[1:38:09] it I kept on looking till I found it if
[1:38:12] you want it I'll be glad to give it to
[1:38:13] you but R said
[1:38:16] Paul said I could have married but ain't
[1:38:19] going to do it Paul was never
[1:38:27] married you see church we just make our
[1:38:29] own
[1:38:30] Doctrine right and we try to make things
[1:38:33] fit to our ways of
[1:38:36] thinking but let's put it all
[1:38:41] together come on musicians let's get it
[1:38:43] all
[1:38:50] together
[1:38:51] you say well brother Dale are you
[1:38:53] stating that those Old Testament Saints
[1:38:55] when brother R said they raised
[1:38:56] physically I'll say what he said they
[1:38:59] raised
[1:39:01] physically
[1:39:03] mortally all I want to know is where
[1:39:05] they
[1:39:06] went I wonder where Enoch went in a
[1:39:09] Rapture before Jesus Paid the price and
[1:39:13] went down to
[1:39:16] Paradise then you say well Paradise was
[1:39:18] emptied
[1:39:20] out
[1:39:22] amen I believe that
[1:39:25] quote but why don't you get on over
[1:39:27] where Paul said he went to Paradise
[1:39:32] that's
[1:39:36] Bible so if Paul went to Paradise
[1:39:39] Paradise must still be
[1:39:43] real you remember when he was talking
[1:39:45] about the third heaven and the things
[1:39:46] and the same thing he said he went to
[1:39:50] Paradise
[1:39:54] Paradise wouldn't
[1:40:00] annihilated it went
[1:40:05] up you say again what are you saying I'm
[1:40:08] saying according to the Bible in
[1:40:09] Revelations 5 and Revelations
[1:40:14] 14 The Prophet said was coming into the
[1:40:16] Millennium bringing them back tribal
[1:40:18] order but there's 24 ers
[1:40:22] 12 Apostles and 12
[1:40:24] Patriarchs right those Old Testament
[1:40:26] Saints is right there in Revelations
[1:40:31] 5 and one day that will be a total
[1:40:35] reality and we'll come back to
[1:40:38] earth until that time comes there's part
[1:40:42] of Revelations 5 that is not complete
[1:40:46] right you want to know what it is you
[1:40:50] right amen
[1:40:59] you are you not the bride amen amen but
[1:41:04] we don't have eternal life in body yet
[1:41:06] do we
[1:41:10] no
[1:41:11] so they're still waiting on us amen you
[1:41:15] order to read some what brother R says
[1:41:17] on day waiting on us read where he says
[1:41:19] they were even waiting on you and I to
[1:41:21] get ourselves straight come on talking
[1:41:24] about them to get ourselves
[1:41:27] straight you know why because we are the
[1:41:31] one keeping the Rapture from coming
[1:41:33] that's right amen he said I see nothing
[1:41:36] outside the Readiness of the
[1:41:38] Bride come
[1:41:42] on we are the on that's doing
[1:41:47] it and we will keep dying until it is
[1:41:51] all made right
[1:41:57] right the death one day will be
[1:42:00] destroyed that's
[1:42:02] right you won't have no hold anymore on
[1:42:06] us but it be real this
[1:42:10] time if I hurt your feelings I'm
[1:42:15] sorry sorry for hurting
[1:42:19] feelings
[1:42:23] I sitting there today thinking lord I
[1:42:24] can't do
[1:42:31] that I'm
[1:42:34] done CU I don't believe in argu with
[1:42:36] nobody and I don't believe in hatching
[1:42:37] up things and preaching on every
