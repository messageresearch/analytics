[10:03] there is peace and contentment
[10:07] in my father's house today
[10:12] lots of
[10:13] food on the table
[10:16] and
[10:17] nobody's turned away
[10:21] there is laughter
[10:23] and singing
[10:26] as the
[10:27] arts pass by
[10:30] but a hush calms the singing
[10:34] as the father sadly cries
[10:39] my
[10:40] house is full
[10:43] but my
[10:44] field is empty
[10:48] who
[10:49] will go and work for me today
[10:56] it seems my children all
[11:00] want to stay
[11:02] around my table
[11:05] but no one wants to work in
[11:09] my field
[11:26] look out through the window pane
[11:30] just beyond the house of plenty
[11:34] lies a field of golden grain
[11:39] and it's white unto harvest
[11:43] but the
[11:44] reapers where are they
[11:47] in the house oh can't the children
[11:51] hear the father sadly say
[11:56] my house is full
[12:00] but my field is empty
[12:04] who
[12:05] will go and work for me today
[12:12] it seems my children all
[12:16] want to stay
[12:18] around my table
[12:20] but no one wants
[12:29] no one
[12:30] wants to work in
[12:33] my fears
[12:48] hey man let's all stand
[12:51] i believe there is a field that's
[12:52] whiteful
[12:53] ready for a harvest
[12:59] amen
[13:00] i believe god has called us to a work
[13:09] i was listening to
[13:11] brother branham and
[13:14] you know you and i are
[13:16] the only eyes that he has the only hands
[13:19] that he has the only feet that he has
[13:23] you know we are
[13:25] to make known the revelation of this
[13:27] word
[13:28] to this world right amen
[13:31] you know i believe it was there in in
[13:33] satan's evening where brother randall
[13:34] was talking about
[13:36] satan
[13:37] was able to get to eve in god's perfect
[13:40] eating everything was perfect but he
[13:42] said let satan have have this eaten
[13:46] this is his world this is his domain
[13:49] see everything was going to be against
[13:50] this end time bride but he was going to
[13:52] prove to satan that she wouldn't fall
[13:57] everything's against us
[13:59] but we can't fall
[14:02] i'm so thankful for that i'm glad i'm
[14:04] not leaning on myself or my own
[14:06] understanding
[14:09] amen we're going to be reading from
[14:11] two scriptures
[14:13] and if y'all
[14:14] you know probably some of you may
[14:16] remember some of you may not remember
[14:18] this was something i preached on in july
[14:21] and so it may be
[14:23] familiar to you and it may be brand new
[14:25] to you even though you might have been
[14:26] here
[14:28] so uh we're gonna be reading from
[14:30] colossians chapter one and then we'll be
[14:32] reading from romans chapter 16.
[14:41] and also i want you to know that if you
[14:43] hear the same thing you heard this
[14:45] morning
[14:46] then brother brother bob didn't read my
[14:49] notes and i didn't read his notes
[14:51] amen
[14:52] but i know there was things this morning
[14:53] he was i told brother wade i told him
[14:55] this morning i said i'm just going to
[14:56] let brother bob preach this afternoon he
[14:58] was
[14:59] he was all over my stuff this morning
[15:02] but it ain't my stuff i mean i mean it's
[15:04] all it's all the word of god
[15:08] but praise the lord we you know somebody
[15:10] gave us something to say this morning
[15:12] and i'm not i'm not going
[15:13] and i i'm not going to say that i'm not
[15:16] worthy to be here because by god's grace
[15:19] i'm worthy
[15:21] god's called us to a job and if he's
[15:23] called us to a place then he's equipped
[15:25] us
[15:26] you know the lord saying is god don't
[15:28] call the equipped he quips the cult
[15:31] he equips us for the job that he has
[15:33] called us too
[15:36] and sometimes you know we
[15:38] i know
[15:39] i always tell everybody where i go and i
[15:41] get up preaching and i tell everybody i
[15:43] said well you know
[15:44] you know they ask you about the fivefold
[15:46] ministry i believe i'm a part of that
[15:48] but but i tell everybody the same thing
[15:50] i said that's right i said i i'm just a
[15:52] spare tire like brother branham said i
[15:54] said that's the reason god made me look
[15:55] like the michelin man
[16:01] because god made each one of us
[16:03] individuals
[16:04] and i can't be nobody else but who i am
[16:09] so i'm i'm happy to be who i am amen
[16:13] because i'm going to be changed
[16:17] as this song says from glory to glory
[16:19] he's changing
[16:21] amen
[16:23] so this afternoon we're just going to
[16:26] read the scripture and
[16:28] y'all pray with me we're going
[16:30] there's so many things this morning i'm

[18:42] chapter 1 verse 21 it says and you
[18:46] who were sometimes alienated and enemies
[18:48] in your mind by wicked works yet now
[18:50] hath he reconciled
[18:52] in the body of his flesh through death
[18:54] to present you holy and unblameable and
[18:56] unreprovable in his sight if you
[18:58] continue in the faith
[19:00] grounded and settled and be not moved
[19:02] away from the hope of the gospel which
[19:04] ye have heard which was preached to
[19:07] every creature which is under heaven
[19:09] whereof i paul and made a minister who
[19:12] now rejoice in my sufferings for you
[19:15] and fill up
[19:17] that which is behind of the afflictions
[19:20] of christ in my flesh
[19:22] for his body sake which is the church
[19:25] whereof i am made a minister according
[19:27] to the dispensation of god which is
[19:29] given to me for you to fulfill the word
[19:32] of god even the mystery which hath been
[19:34] hid from ages and from generation but
[19:36] now is made manifest to his saints to
[19:38] whom god would make known what is the
[19:40] riches of the glory of this mystery
[19:43] among the gentiles which is christ in
[19:45] you the hope of glory whom we preach
[19:47] warning every man and teaching every man
[19:49] in all wisdom that we may present every
[19:52] man perfect in christ jesus
[19:54] whereunto i also labor striving
[19:56] according to his work
[19:58] which worketh in me mightily amen amen
[20:01] we'll go to romans chapter 16 verse 25.
[20:07] romans 16
[20:10] verse 25
[20:12] it says now to him that is of power to
[20:15] establish you according to my gospel and
[20:17] the preaching of jesus christ according
[20:20] to the revelation of the mystery which
[20:21] was kept secret since the world began
[20:24] but now is made manifest and by the
[20:27] scriptures of the prophets according to
[20:30] the commandment of the everlasting god
[20:32] made known to all nations for the
[20:34] obedience of faith amen amen the lord
[20:37] blessing the reading of the word you may
[20:38] be seated
[20:46] you know sometimes you you wonder what
[20:48] direction to go
[20:49] with something and
[20:51] you pray and you say well lord what
[20:53] should i say and
[20:55] sometimes you end up with so much you
[20:56] don't know how to
[20:58] you don't know how to get to all of it
[21:00] because you know there's certain
[21:03] there are certain parts of scripture you
[21:04] get to
[21:05] and you preach just the whole sermon on
[21:07] just one part of a scripture
[21:09] just that one phrase will you preach a
[21:12] whole sermon on so
[21:16] i just want to
[21:17] cover a few things this today but i want
[21:20] to speak on as as i was speaking
[21:22] previously on the mystery and the secret
[21:24] of god or god's secret mystery that
[21:27] and you know brother man even talks
[21:28] about the secret mystery
[21:31] but uh i also want to look at
[21:34] there's a phrase that caught my
[21:35] attention it's called the and it's here
[21:37] in the colossians and it says the riches
[21:39] of the glory of this mystery the riches
[21:42] of that and if you look up the word myst
[21:45] of riches
[21:46] you know the the word riches uh means
[21:49] abundance
[21:52] it means the fullness
[21:55] and you know if you go back and you look
[21:56] and and you start to study
[21:59] the scripture
[22:00] you know because we say well it's he's
[22:02] going to make known this riches
[22:06] but you know sometimes we we fail to see
[22:09] what he what he's
[22:11] what paul's trying to
[22:13] express to the people because we say
[22:15] well it's the fullness
[22:17] but you know actually what he's what
[22:18] he's trying to express to the people is
[22:20] he's trying to understand that when this
[22:22] mystery is going to be more than you can
[22:24] contain right
[22:26] because it's an over because
[22:28] what words can you describe it i mean
[22:31] it's over abundance it's overflowing
[22:33] it's it's excelling
[22:36] so you know when he talks about this
[22:38] mystery that becomes un uh open that's
[22:41] going to be revealed to the people
[22:43] as he's speaking this the glory these
[22:45] riches that's in the scripture is going
[22:47] to be made known to you as the scripture
[22:49] he said he said i'll open up the windows
[22:51] of heaven and pour out a blessing you
[22:53] can't contain exactly
[22:55] because later on we'll get to the
[22:57] scripture here
[22:59] lord willing now i want to get to the
[23:01] scripture there where it talks about
[23:03] the volume of the book
[23:05] yeah and you know and understanding what
[23:08] what is that and what does that mean if
[23:09] i don't know if we'll get to that far
[23:10] but you know understanding as paul said
[23:12] to understand these things
[23:14] so
[23:15] as we as we get to that point i want to
[23:17] understand what the mystery is the
[23:20] secret that god has for us and the
[23:22] riches
[23:24] because you know brother branham said
[23:25] you know
[23:26] we we don't comprehend what god has in
[23:29] store for us he said that would be a
[23:31] message of cheer down through the
[23:32] endless ages so we've not only scratched
[23:34] the surface of what god has for us
[23:38] we only we only in in this area we can
[23:41] only see things in a minute form
[23:44] that's right
[23:46] you know
[23:48] i don't know if many of you may not
[23:49] remember i preached a message one time i
[23:51] preached on the on the essence of god
[23:55] and you know
[23:56] because every time i go back to that
[23:58] same that one message that i preached
[24:00] and i don't know if you remember that's
[24:01] the only time i've ever used a
[24:03] chalkboard or the
[24:04] mark board up here and but you know
[24:07] you see the the things that open up when
[24:10] the word opens up to you you know what
[24:13] that's that's the foundation for
[24:15] something that's the basis for something
[24:17] because upon that he's going to build
[24:20] because more will open up from that amen
[24:23] so when you see who you are when you
[24:25] start to see who you are when this word
[24:27] opens up even more you're going to see
[24:29] who you are
[24:33] so
[24:34] so when we see when he when uh
[24:36] brother brown was speaking
[24:38] i would go back through some of these
[24:40] things and i want you to
[24:42] the lord's help i want to show you these
[24:44] things
[24:45] and uh y'all pray for them back there
[24:47] i've got all this stuff jumbled up and
[24:50] i don't know which order it's going to
[24:51] be in so i'm just going to i'm just
[24:53] going to tell the brothers where it's
[24:54] set and they just have to go back around
[24:55] trying to try to find everything
[24:57] but
[24:58] uh you're looking back at what a what a
[25:01] mystery is
[25:02] and you know we covered that
[25:05] understanding what a what a mystery is
[25:07] and what a revelation is i mean and a
[25:09] secret a mystery is something
[25:12] definition of a mystery something not
[25:14] understood or beyond understanding
[25:18] a religious truth that one
[25:21] can know only by revelation and cannot
[25:24] fully understand
[25:26] because you know brother branham said
[25:28] there was a supernatural element
[25:31] that remained despite the mystery so
[25:33] there was still a part there and and a
[25:35] secret is something kept from knowledge
[25:37] or view revealed only to the initiated
[25:39] designed to elude observation or
[25:42] detection so working with hitting aims
[25:44] or methods
[25:46] so there was something that is that
[25:48] secret
[25:50] that is to be made known
[25:54] and this is from the this quote is from
[25:57] uh
[25:58] the world's falling apart 1963
[26:01] e e6 or e15 and brother brown's talking
[26:05] about
[26:06] he said and god is the word in the
[26:07] beginning was the word and the word was
[26:09] with god and the word was god it's still
[26:11] god that's right it is the word and when
[26:13] you get away from the word then you're
[26:15] away from god
[26:17] jesus said if ye abide in me he said
[26:20] there's the sick there's the mystery
[26:22] there's a secret if ye abide in me and
[26:24] my word abide in you then ask what you
[26:26] will see the idea is first god's word
[26:29] got to abide here
[26:32] so that's the first thing we got to
[26:33] understand the word's got to abide in us
[26:37] and so when
[26:39] god start brother brandon said in christ
[26:40] the mystery
[26:43] he said now god's secret mystery he had
[26:46] before the world began this is christ
[26:47] the mystery
[26:49] 16 2.
[26:52] he's in a god secret mystery he had
[26:55] before the world began he said now back
[26:57] in the back part of god's mind there was
[26:59] something that he was trying and was
[27:01] going to achieve and he had a motive in
[27:03] doing it in order to let himself be
[27:05] expressed
[27:06] because first there wasn't even a moon
[27:08] star i had a molecule in anything he was
[27:10] god
[27:11] but he exactly wasn't god at that time
[27:13] because god is an odd object of worship
[27:17] object of worship
[27:18] and there wasn't nothing to worship him
[27:20] so in his great mind he wanted these
[27:22] attributes to be expressed
[27:24] and in him was love and in him was to be
[27:26] father
[27:28] and it was to be
[27:30] son and him was to be savior and him was
[27:32] to be healer and all these great
[27:33] attributes that he that we see already
[27:36] expressed they were in god
[27:39] so we know that as brother dale's been
[27:41] preaching we know that he was elohim
[27:43] self-existing but he had these
[27:46] attributes that he wanted to be
[27:47] expressed
[27:48] and when you when you see that you know
[27:51] it's not something else that he was
[27:52] wanting to express
[27:54] because that was me
[27:58] because that was that that because if we
[28:01] if you don't see it that way then you're
[28:02] missing the point right
[28:06] well he has he has an attribute that he
[28:07] wanted to express
[28:10] well sure there was he wanted to he
[28:12] wanted to be a
[28:15] god so he created angels and then he
[28:18] could become god
[28:20] but you know what he wanted to be a
[28:21] savior he wanted to be a healer he
[28:23] wanted to be a redeemer
[28:25] but you know what he didn't he didn't do
[28:27] that for adam and eve
[28:29] he didn't do it for anybody else he done
[28:31] it for aaron roberts
[28:33] it didn't matter it don't matter who
[28:34] else because that's the only way that it
[28:36] that it means anything is it means it's
[28:39] me it's to me
[28:41] because
[28:42] i want to get to it later on because see
[28:44] when you start to see him unfold himself
[28:47] brother madam said you become the center
[28:49] of the revelation
[28:51] so if you don't see that it's you
[28:56] see everybody everybody wants to make it
[28:57] the bride the bride the bride
[29:00] you know when i go back to that message
[29:01] where in the essence of god when i
[29:03] preach that message you know brother
[29:04] madam said in jehovah jireh in 1964 he
[29:07] said all that god was he poured into
[29:10] christ he said all that christ was he
[29:13] didn't say poured into the body he said
[29:15] he poured into the believer right amen
[29:18] amen
[29:19] why because you are the fullness of who
[29:21] you are to be in this day
[29:24] glory amen
[29:26] i'm not i'm not the fullness of the
[29:28] godhead bodily but you know what i am
[29:30] the fullness of what god wants to
[29:32] express in aaron roberts amen amen
[29:36] why because he was the fullness that's
[29:38] what god wanted to express
[29:43] so this is and you say well you're a
[29:45] poor excuse well i agree with you
[29:50] but you know what that's what he's doing
[29:56] so he started out with whatever but you
[29:58] know he's working it and molding it into
[30:01] the into the fashion that he wants it to
[30:02] be
[30:04] because he said that's the thing right
[30:06] here he said because when he had that
[30:08] attribute that thought that attribute
[30:10] he said he had something in his mind
[30:12] that he was going to achieve
[30:14] amen
[30:15] so guess what you say well you're a poor
[30:17] excuse i agree with you but guess what
[30:19] he's not done yet why because he said he
[30:22] was going to achieve it
[30:24] amen exactly so whatever whatever god
[30:27] has for me to do then that's what he's
[30:29] going to achieve
[30:32] amen
[30:36] it says
[30:38] you know god had a this is christ a
[30:40] mystery he said god had a purpose and a
[30:41] hidden mystery
[30:43] he said that's what i want to speak to
[30:45] the church on this morning this hidden
[30:46] mystery of god that he had in his mind
[30:49] before the world ever begin
[30:50] and how that has unfolded itself right
[30:52] down to this present hour that we're
[30:54] living
[30:57] and they will understand clearly you see
[30:59] oh i believe what is being done
[31:02] he said god's great mystery of how it's
[31:04] a secret he kept it a secret nobody know
[31:07] nothing about it
[31:09] even the angels didn't understand it
[31:11] exactly
[31:13] he didn't reveal it that's the reason
[31:16] under our seventh mystery when the
[31:17] seventh seal was open there was silence
[31:22] and then from
[31:23] continuing on brother braden says this
[31:25] is uh
[31:26] 22 4.
[31:28] he says now notice god has had a
[31:30] threefold purpose in this great mystery
[31:33] secret god in his great mystery secret
[31:36] that he had before the world began he's
[31:39] got a threefold purpose in it
[31:42] so he said there was a threefold purpose
[31:44] in that mystery so he had this mystery
[31:47] that he wanted to unfold and it came
[31:49] down as the scripture tells us it come
[31:51] down to our day
[31:53] you know from the beginning so we go
[31:55] back through and brother man talks in
[31:57] the message christ the mystery you know
[31:58] he said god started in the beginning and
[32:01] i believe it's in uh
[32:03] the message masterpiece where he talks
[32:04] about he said you know the patriarchs
[32:06] created the body you know he was
[32:07] bringing it down and he talks about
[32:09] abraham isaac jacob and joseph each one
[32:11] of them typing each one of the stages of
[32:13] justification sanctification and joseph
[32:15] being for perfection and then he talks
[32:17] about the prophets he said the prophets
[32:19] built the body he said every one of them
[32:21] came through and they was expressing
[32:23] christ for their time just like when he
[32:25] stood there and he said he said i always
[32:27] wondered why
[32:28] moses how moses could tell god a better
[32:31] way to do something and he said i come
[32:33] to find out it was christ and moses so
[32:36] that's how he could tell him because why
[32:38] because that's who christ was christ was
[32:40] making himself known all the way through
[32:42] the scripture so when he came to a
[32:44] certain time
[32:47] as each one of them unfolded he said
[32:49] joseph had his party ezekiel had his
[32:51] part and so even each one of them as
[32:53] they came through when jesus came
[32:57] they should have clearly known who he
[32:58] was because he had been expressing
[33:01] himself the whole time
[33:03] but see that was the secret that was was
[33:06] being made known
[33:08] because a secret was because it was
[33:11] unknown to anybody except for him and
[33:14] each one of the prophets had their
[33:16] portion of it right but that was the
[33:18] secret
[33:20] the secret was what he was trying to do
[33:22] right
[33:23] amos and if you go back to amos three
[33:26] and seven says he was surely
[33:29] do nothing
[33:31] but he said he revealeth right right
[33:37] he would say reveal
[33:38] his secret
[33:40] right
[33:41] singular he said reveal his secret unto
[33:44] his servants the prophets right so he
[33:47] was revealing the secret
[33:49] unto the prophets so that's what they
[33:51] came to do now revelation 10 7
[33:55] see if brother
[33:57] brother bob's got that one
[33:59] but if you come to 10 7 then you'll see
[34:02] that he said that it's he came to reveal
[34:05] the mystery
[34:07] singular right so there had to be come
[34:09] see he said in the days of the voice of
[34:10] savanth angel when he shall begin the
[34:12] sound the mystery of god
[34:15] why because the secret had been made
[34:17] known
[34:18] see it was secret all this time
[34:21] but then when when brother branham come
[34:22] brother didn't come to preach anything
[34:24] new
[34:25] he said i come to top the loose sins he
[34:28] said the the sales were in the scripture
[34:30] he said he come to understand those
[34:32] mysteries he said the mystery was there
[34:34] then the mystery could be made known
[34:38] but without a secret see it becomes a
[34:40] secret because
[34:42] if you've never seen anything if you've
[34:44] never heard of anything then you know
[34:46] it's a secret to you
[34:50] but until until then then it becomes
[34:52] something that becomes a mystery
[34:56] so you know that's the reason that you
[34:57] know they could read through the
[34:59] scripture
[35:01] as you know jesus told me it asserts the
[35:03] scripture
[35:05] he said then you think you have eternal
[35:07] life but they testify of me
[35:09] they should have known who he was they
[35:11] should have seen who he was why because
[35:14] all the scriptures identified who he was
[35:19] what'd he do he said he said who can who
[35:21] can convince me of sin
[35:23] show me where i've missed it
[35:26] and that was that was their job show me
[35:28] where where he had missed and what he
[35:30] had done
[35:32] but until but if if it
[35:35] if you didn't have someone to show you
[35:38] yeah
[35:39] right if you didn't have someone to show
[35:41] you and point these things out
[35:43] you wouldn't know it
[35:46] what because what what did the what did
[35:48] the prophets do
[35:51] each one of the prophets when they came
[35:54] when daniel come
[35:56] he said i understood by books
[36:00] who did he who did he read from he just
[36:03] didn't get it it didn't just fall out of
[36:04] the sky and hit him in the head
[36:07] right
[36:09] right
[36:10] he said i understood my books who did he
[36:13] read
[36:14] he read the prophet jeremiah
[36:17] he read the scroll
[36:18] exactly
[36:20] he said our deliverance is coming
[36:22] glory
[36:23] see he had to understand that
[36:27] when jesus came and he stood there in
[36:29] the temple he took the book
[36:32] isaiah
[36:33] when he took the book he took the book
[36:35] from the priest and he opened it he said
[36:37] and he found the scripture there where
[36:40] it said
[36:41] he hath anointed me
[36:43] to preach the scripture
[36:45] to preach
[36:47] see when he found well because that was
[36:50] the scripture see it had been spoken
[36:53] but someone had to show that
[36:56] and so each one of the prophets they
[36:57] went back
[36:59] and looked
[37:00] at what was what was previously preached
[37:03] what was previously taught and they
[37:05] brought it to present day
[37:08] each one each one of the prophets they
[37:10] didn't because you can't find
[37:12] contradictions in what they were saying
[37:17] on the day of pentecost it wasn't a
[37:19] contradiction
[37:22] well here's a bunch of drunk folks
[37:24] he wasn't drunk
[37:28] what was it it was a fulfillment of the
[37:30] word
[37:32] you know peter stood up and said
[37:34] he said these people aren't drunk as you
[37:36] suppose he said but this is that that
[37:37] was spoken of
[37:41] so we knew that each one of them had to
[37:43] go back
[37:45] and look in the scripture all the way
[37:47] through the old testament they're
[37:49] looking back at the previous
[37:52] prophets
[37:55] and so each one of them even even other
[37:57] ones when they even you look at david
[38:00] excuse me when you look at what david
[38:02] had to say how many times did he refer
[38:04] back to moses
[38:07] even when he's going through the psalms
[38:08] and he refers back to the previous
[38:10] people all the ones that were said god
[38:12] done this and god done that and god said
[38:14] to them
[38:16] so they're all the time pointing back
[38:20] so that's what brother branham done lots
[38:22] of times when brother branham come to to
[38:24] minister you know is amazing you
[38:26] sometimes when he preaches messages you
[38:28] know what he didn't go when he just take
[38:30] an example when brother branham preached
[38:32] the rapture he didn't go to the new
[38:34] testament to preach the rapture
[38:38] what did he do he went to the old
[38:40] testament well because he went back to
[38:42] what david done
[38:44] that's what david had said and then he
[38:46] brought it into the new testament and
[38:48] then brought it present day
[38:50] so that's what they were supposed to do
[38:51] was bring it present day
[38:53] so each one of them brought it through
[38:55] bringing it from the previous one and
[38:57] bring it to present day
[38:59] and so we see how it became unfolded so
[39:02] that he was showing how it was
[39:04] continuity all through the scripture
[39:07] he said
[39:09] so we see this secret is becoming
[39:11] unfolded
[39:14] so as the scripture was unfolding to
[39:17] each one of the prophets see that it
[39:19] become
[39:20] building the body
[39:22] the fullness thereof and then he could
[39:24] step onto the scene and show
[39:26] who he was
[39:31] so
[39:33] the scripture
[39:36] when they when he started to unfold this
[39:39] this great mystery
[39:42] you know this this great mystery that
[39:44] we've
[39:45] been a part of
[39:48] you know brother dale's been preaching
[39:49] on and you know
[39:52] when as he was talking about how does
[39:54] god predestinate
[39:57] that was because that that's the
[39:59] understanding the mystery
[40:01] of what was taken because it comes down
[40:03] to you
[40:05] because you come back and he said
[40:07] when when were you brother man says you
[40:09] know
[40:10] when did he choose us
[40:12] he said before the foundation of the
[40:14] world
[40:16] he said when his great hidden mystery
[40:17] this great secret he chose us in christ
[40:20] before the foundation of the world
[40:23] in the back part of god's mind he said
[40:25] let's go back to the back part of god's
[40:26] mind that's where this thing started
[40:29] right and he started to unfold this
[40:31] thing amen and that you know it's so
[40:33] amazing because
[40:34] you see
[40:36] we can look and say
[40:39] we we look too much to the to the things
[40:42] around us
[40:43] we look too much of of this world
[40:47] but if we could see you know i always
[40:49] was a part of god
[40:52] uh you know and to see who who you are
[40:55] right but to understand who how you came
[40:59] amen
[41:01] because you know so there's so many
[41:03] people that have
[41:04] got everything all scrupled up
[41:07] why because they're not looking
[41:10] to the one that could reveal the
[41:12] scriptures
[41:14] right
[41:15] you know there's a
[41:17] we have
[41:18] a i was looking at a
[41:21] a map the other day and
[41:25] it is
[41:26] something i i've seen before
[41:29] and
[41:30] uh
[41:32] so maybe you think about things and then
[41:35] someone else will bring it up and you'll
[41:37] hear the same thing over and over and
[41:38] it's you know something that catches
[41:40] your attention but we're working on a
[41:42] unit and uh
[41:44] had a schematic inside of it and the guy
[41:46] he was hunting the whole thing and uh
[41:50] do you who knows do you know what a
[41:51] legend is they maybe have you ever seen
[41:53] a map knows what a legend is
[41:57] and you know
[41:58] a legend is the thing on a map or a
[42:01] schematic or something that explains to
[42:03] you what the symbols are
[42:06] yeah
[42:07] so we're looking at this thing and this
[42:08] guy he's scanning this whole big
[42:10] schematic there and he's looking right
[42:11] he's a where's the legend where's the
[42:13] legend he's scanning this thing where's
[42:15] the legend where's he going because he
[42:17] said without it
[42:19] you can see a lot of things but you
[42:21] can't see things clearly you don't
[42:22] understand things clearly
[42:26] and you know
[42:27] that's what that's what it takes it
[42:28] takes a legend
[42:32] because you can have
[42:34] understanding
[42:35] and you look at a lot of road maps road
[42:38] maps and you know brother brown said
[42:39] that
[42:41] he said we use the bible as a road map
[42:44] he said we're getting here to glory he
[42:45] said we're going from mortal to
[42:47] immortality
[42:50] but you know what it takes
[42:51] more than just having
[42:54] the road map
[42:57] because if you don't have the legend
[43:01] i thought you don't preach a message
[43:02] called the legend of the word
[43:07] but you know
[43:08] if without a legend it doesn't it
[43:10] doesn't mean because you know you can
[43:12] leave here and
[43:14] travel someplace
[43:16] and as brother branham was talking about
[43:17] he said you know you need to take a map
[43:20] and he said if you take that map
[43:23] then you say well i'm going to a certain
[43:25] place and they say well which direction
[43:26] do i need to go well go north
[43:29] well how far do you go north
[43:32] you know if i was going someplace you
[43:34] know i can say northeast west south
[43:35] whatever i can go in that direction
[43:38] and that might get me closer than i am
[43:40] today
[43:41] but you know what before i get to that
[43:43] destination i've got to know
[43:45] have a better understanding of where i'm
[43:48] going and how to get there
[43:51] than i do today because you know i can
[43:53] say well i'm going north
[43:56] well how far north
[43:58] because you end up saying okay well now
[44:00] i've got to go south
[44:02] but see you start to go and then you've
[44:04] got to under brother ram said you've got
[44:05] to know the signpost you've got to find
[44:08] the signpost that's going to point you
[44:10] in the right direction
[44:12] but you can see the signposts along the
[44:13] road but if you don't understand what
[44:15] the map is telling you
[44:18] the signposts don't mean anything right
[44:21] so we've had we had to have someone in
[44:24] in our day
[44:26] right because see
[44:28] it was made known to us he came to
[44:31] reveal his secret that but see the thing
[44:33] was
[44:34] it was laid out
[44:37] and here it is
[44:39] but how many people understood what was
[44:41] said
[44:43] until someone came to show us what this
[44:45] said who knew what it said
[44:48] and it's like a lot of people you go
[44:50] down the road and somebody's traveling
[44:52] well people can look at a map and they
[44:54] kind of figure out what it means
[44:58] but you know what that doesn't mean they
[44:59] actually know what it means
[45:02] and let me tell you when you work on
[45:04] something that's this that's 460 volt
[45:07] three-phase
[45:08] you don't want to you don't want to be
[45:10] guessing too much about what what a
[45:13] schematic is showing you
[45:17] you want to have a good idea what you're
[45:19] doing
[45:21] because you know what you can get up
[45:22] there you can spend hours looking at
[45:24] something i've actually sat down with a
[45:26] manual
[45:28] and not even i i have no idea what what
[45:30] some of these air how some of these air
[45:31] conditioners work i've had to sit down
[45:33] with a book and i just sat in red red
[45:35] red red red red and you know what i
[45:37] finally figure out what's going on and
[45:38] then i can kind of work on it
[45:41] but you know what i've had to call
[45:42] people and ask them questions and
[45:43] somebody's they knew what they were
[45:45] talking about what had been through this
[45:47] had an experience with something you
[45:49] know what they could tell me how to work
[45:51] on something
[45:52] but you know what it took it took more
[45:54] than just looking at a schematic because
[45:56] that drawing explains a lot of things
[45:58] and a lot of people knew a lot of things
[45:59] about this message and i knew a lot
[46:02] about the scriptures and a lot of people
[46:04] have guessed and they've guessed right
[46:05] on things but you know what they were
[46:07] utterly confused on other points but you
[46:10] know what it would never get them to the
[46:11] right place
[46:14] so you know it took more than that
[46:15] because it took somebody that understood
[46:19] right
[46:20] and see it wasn't it wasn't
[46:23] uh
[46:24] when the seventh angel came when brother
[46:26] branham came to minister these things to
[46:28] us it wasn't brother branham
[46:33] it was
[46:34] the one who wrote it in the beginning
[46:36] the one that had the thought in the
[46:37] beginning
[46:39] the one that had the attributes that was
[46:41] going to be expressed when he expressed
[46:44] it here that he was the one that came
[46:46] and told what he had written
[46:49] that's right amen so when he stood there
[46:52] see the thing was see he became he came
[46:54] to speak to us the mystery that was
[46:57] hidden in the scripture but you know
[46:59] what people missed the secret of what
[47:01] was going on
[47:05] because you know what he was just like
[47:07] he was talking about the latter in the
[47:08] former rain coming at the same time see
[47:11] people miss
[47:12] missed it because they were looking for
[47:14] a lighter rain and didn't realize they
[47:15] were receiving the teaching rain right
[47:18] the former rain was coming and on top of
[47:20] that he said the former and
[47:23] the latter was coming at the same time
[47:26] see people missed that because he stood
[47:28] there brother brandon stood there and he
[47:30] was revealing the secret and you know
[47:31] what when he was bringing these things
[47:33] out it was still a mystery to people
[47:36] it was a mystery to begin with and it
[47:38] was and it was still another mystery
[47:41] right
[47:45] brother bob said he didn't drink that
[47:46] this morning so
[47:48] he told me to feel free
[47:51] i told him that
[47:52] brother i'm so we should be able to chew
[47:54] each other's chewing gum
[47:57] all things are sanctified by the word of
[47:58] god in prayer
[48:05] i'm not gonna drink i'm not gonna drink
[48:06] battery acid or nothing but you know i
[48:08] believe he said if you drink any deadly
[48:10] thing it's trying to hurt you
[48:13] i'm not going out picking up snakes or
[48:14] nothing but you know
[48:16] amen
[48:19] but you know the the secret was being he
[48:23] was unfolding what was there the brother
[48:26] i'm stood there and he was trying to
[48:28] express what was hidden in this in the
[48:30] word
[48:32] but you know what people missed was he
[48:34] said because he said have you called
[48:36] what's been going on this week he was
[48:38] trying to get the people to see he
[48:40] because he stood there and plainly said
[48:42] to he said here stands a lamb with a
[48:44] book in his hand
[48:50] brother branham wasn't a lamb right he
[48:52] wasn't talking about some figurative
[48:54] speech or something he was not trying to
[48:56] get somebody to imagine something in his
[48:58] mind he was trying to get the people to
[49:00] understand that christ the word was
[49:02] there and he was the one expressing what
[49:04] was written in the word amen
[49:07] as you know as as bob kept saying this
[49:09] morning you know he said when you turn
[49:11] on elijah when you turn on elijah well
[49:13] you know that's the holy ghost that's
[49:16] jesus christ
[49:20] i'm not listening to brother branham
[49:25] see people people get their minds
[49:26] confused they think we're listening to a
[49:28] man right
[49:30] that's right
[49:32] you know you know
[49:34] it boggles my mind sometimes but you
[49:36] know you think say paul said follow me
[49:39] as i follow christ
[49:42] you think about where paul came from
[49:45] you look at you look at the life in the
[49:47] ministry of paul paul was a man who was
[49:50] one of the highly educated theologians
[49:52] of his time who had great rank in the
[49:55] among the people
[49:58] he had the best of everything a lot of
[50:00] people looked up to him he had prestige
[50:02] he had power
[50:04] but you know what he considered all that
[50:06] dung right
[50:08] and here comes a man who was polished in
[50:11] everything that he knew he knew the
[50:13] scripture he knew the word and he come
[50:15] along and the next thing you know he's
[50:16] down there bacon in the sun and he's
[50:19] sowing tents
[50:23] here's a man when you read in
[50:24] corinthians when he was telling the
[50:25] corinthians about his life how many
[50:27] times he'd been shipwrecked how many
[50:28] times he'd been beaten how many times
[50:30] he'd been whipped all the things that he
[50:32] happened to him
[50:33] he said i'll bear in my body the marks
[50:35] of jesus christ glory you know he was
[50:38] written in the scripture here telling us
[50:39] you know he bears these in his body face
[50:42] it and these things happen to him for
[50:44] the body sake the church
[50:47] you look at him and you know no one no
[50:49] doubt he was bent over and hunched over
[50:51] if you'd been tore and beat up and all
[50:53] the things that happened to him you know
[50:54] what he was not the same man that he
[50:56] used to be
[51:01] and you look at the kind of life that he
[51:02] had me stand up and say you know
[51:04] preaching and being in prison
[51:08] and people going around saying i follow
[51:10] paul
[51:15] i believe what paul believes i believe i
[51:18] preached what paul preached
[51:19] yeah
[51:21] do you not believe that there was a
[51:22] stigma that went with that
[51:26] people say you're crazy you've lost your
[51:28] mind
[51:30] well praise god i hope i do
[51:33] i hope i have that i can gain the mind
[51:35] of christ as paul said amen
[51:39] so you know what i'm not following a man
[51:41] but i am following the god of that man i
[51:43] want that god because you know there's
[51:45] one thing i want you to understand if i
[51:47] don't get anything else to you today i
[51:49] want you to understand one thing because
[51:51] when brother brandon spoke of paul in
[51:53] this great mystery when this mystery the
[51:56] secret that he had because he wants to
[51:58] feel as brother brown said he's able to
[51:59] feel every fiber of your being
[52:03] he said he said
[52:05] you know you can be so full of god the
[52:07] devil don't know what to do with
[52:10] see that's what that's what this great
[52:13] mystery is
[52:16] is to for you and for you to understand
[52:19] that you and god are one
[52:22] but you know because but see we we
[52:25] people are so confused on so many things
[52:31] you know there's one thing that i've
[52:33] been that i am thoroughly convinced of
[52:36] in in this message
[52:37] because people people don't don't
[52:39] believe what was said right
[52:42] people are utterly confused and they
[52:45] just won't admit i'm confused
[52:48] they've got to build up their their as
[52:51] as the expression is they got to build
[52:52] up a house of cards
[52:55] they you know they've got to try to
[52:57] build up something that absolutely has
[52:59] no has no basis and has no foundation
[53:02] and won't hold anything right
[53:04] right
[53:05] many times you hear these you hear these
[53:07] people and
[53:09] and you know
[53:11] you know it's so amazing it's telling
[53:14] way that we were talking
[53:16] you you hear these people and what they
[53:18] have to say
[53:20] you know it used to be that people would
[53:22] say
[53:23] a few times well brother random said
[53:25] such and you know you were going to say
[53:26] was that before the seals
[53:29] was that after the seals
[53:31] that's what we want to know
[53:33] you know what's gotten worse now oh yeah
[53:36] absolutely yeah
[53:38] it doesn't matter if it's after the
[53:39] seals or not
[53:40] they want to know what month
[53:44] was that 64-63
[53:46] yeah
[53:47] now if he said in 65 then out of trump's
[53:50] 64 and 63.
[53:55] they tell me what month it was it's
[53:57] going to give way to go get to them get
[53:59] to the point the only message people
[54:00] want to believe is communion
[54:04] the last the last sermon he preached now
[54:06] this is this is what he said right here
[54:08] he was he was not the son of charles and
[54:10] ella branham yeah
[54:12] that's all that's all we're going to
[54:13] believe we don't believe nothing else
[54:19] when brother brown said talking on on
[54:22] the on the new birth he said he said
[54:24] i've preached this my entire life right
[54:26] amen
[54:27] amen but you know i've heard people that
[54:29] supposedly claim to believe this message
[54:32] and you know what they say if you
[54:33] believe in justification sanctification
[54:34] of the baptism of the holy ghost you
[54:36] know what
[54:37] pentecostal
[54:40] you don't believe this end time message
[54:41] if you believe that
[54:43] got it in black and white yeah
[54:47] because brother branham preached it
[54:49] it's receiving the holy ghost and that
[54:51] was it all you had to receive was holy
[54:52] ghost
[54:54] because brother brown preached the new
[54:55] birth different
[54:57] after yeah
[54:59] and they said well we're going to go to
[55:01] future home 1964 we'll show you
[55:04] we're going to 65.
[55:06] got you trumped 65.
[55:12] it's terrible
[55:14] that's right preach on predestination
[55:16] the full knowledge of god
[55:18] for knowledge out the window we don't
[55:20] believe that anymore chunked it yeah
[55:22] it's pentecostal
[55:24] that was
[55:25] you know that was something that brother
[55:26] branham preached after the seals
[55:29] preach it all all through it all through
[55:30] the message right
[55:32] chunk that out the window we don't do
[55:33] that anymore
[55:35] we got the revelation february
[55:37] 1965.
[55:40] i got one to trumpia
[55:42] november 1965 trying to do god of
[55:44] service yeah
[55:46] you know what he said he said not like
[55:48] you say i'll choose this one i'll choose
[55:50] that one right now
[55:53] wasn't for it was my foreknowledge he
[55:55] said he didn't use predestination the
[55:57] way you thought he did right
[55:59] by four knowledge
[56:01] but you know what try to show them that
[56:07] you think you think it's a joke but it's
[56:09] not right
[56:10] we go to these ministers meetings and
[56:12] sometimes it's sad
[56:17] i i honestly honestly it's sad
[56:19] you go in there and you try you try to
[56:20] explain something people and you know
[56:22] what they think you're a bully
[56:26] we got we have ministers our our pastors
[56:29] here brother dale and brother wade have
[56:31] been considered bullies
[56:36] the strong ones
[56:38] they call the strong bullies yeah i just
[56:40] tell i just call it what is i mean you
[56:41] know call white white black black it's
[56:44] bullies that's what they call them
[56:45] bullies
[56:50] you step on their pet doctrine
[56:53] you're a bully
[56:55] you know that's a new term if you hear
[56:57] if you watch the news or whatever you
[56:58] hear the news i thought bullying people
[57:00] get bullied all the time well
[57:02] we have a bullying spirit in this church
[57:09] praise the lord
[57:13] hey you know what
[57:14] brother dale i i'm honestly you tell me
[57:17] another minister in this message who's
[57:19] ever stood up and said as much as
[57:22] brother dale has and i want somebody to
[57:24] show me this got up and said my wife
[57:27] don't have to believe what i preach i
[57:29] just want her to understand it my kids
[57:31] don't have to believe what i preach but
[57:33] i want them to understand it you don't
[57:35] have to believe what i believe but i
[57:36] want you to understand it
[57:41] how many how many preachers do you know
[57:43] how many pastors do you know that'll do
[57:44] that
[57:48] they'll tell you if you don't believe
[57:49] what i do
[57:51] get out the door and make sure the door
[57:52] don't hit you
[57:57] you know someone amazed me brother man
[57:59] who said one time and they were they
[58:00] were asking and questions and answers
[58:02] and you know they were saying well you
[58:04] know should we come to we have to come
[58:05] to jeff and brother brown is the only
[58:06] one that can preach you know he's like
[58:08] you know you you read these you know if
[58:10] you listen to brother when he's when
[58:11] he's in question answer and he reads
[58:13] some of these questions you know you can
[58:14] tell they just catch him off guard and
[58:16] he's just like i mean it blows his mind
[58:18] that people are asking him these
[58:19] questions but that's what people believe
[58:22] and brotherhood said i'm not the only
[58:23] pebble on the beach
[58:25] how many times did he say you know
[58:27] brother you know brother snelling and
[58:28] different ones were out preaching he
[58:30] said you go and hear these brothers you
[58:31] go away or you go support them
[58:34] you know he didn't he didn't ever try to
[58:36] do away with fellowship right but you
[58:38] know what he wanted people to understand
[58:40] he wanted people to come to an
[58:42] understanding of what the scripture had
[58:43] to say
[58:48] you get your you get your understanding
[58:50] you can say whatever you want to then
[58:51] guess what it's it's time for us to be
[58:53] able to say what we believe
[58:56] and then you know you come and you say
[58:57] well show me
[58:59] exactly
[59:01] this is what the scripture said you
[59:03] showed me where it's where where it
[59:05] messes where it fails to follow the
[59:07] scripture
[59:10] because you know brother dale has always
[59:11] said you know you start with a white dog
[59:13] in the beginning you got to end with a
[59:15] white dog in the end
[59:18] and you know that's what he said jesus
[59:19] christ is saying yesterday today and
[59:21] forever if that's what he started with
[59:23] if that's the way he started then that's
[59:25] the way it's going to end right he don't
[59:26] change his ways
[59:30] he's he started a certain way and that's
[59:32] the way he's going to end
[59:42] now
[59:44] this is from this is from questions and
[59:45] answers
[59:47] you know brother i'm speaking and
[59:50] you know people people
[59:53] have put so much
[59:55] on on the new birth
[59:58] and you know they they make it well i
[1:00:00] was predestinated
[1:00:02] yeah you know they they come from here
[1:00:04] and you try to you try to tell them
[1:00:07] you come here lost
[1:00:10] you you come here as as the prophet told
[1:00:13] us you know we were all on our way to
[1:00:14] hell
[1:00:17] we you were all lost dying going to hell
[1:00:19] there was there was nothing except for
[1:00:20] the grace of god that passed by you one
[1:00:22] day but you know he knew that in the
[1:00:24] beginning
[1:00:26] amen
[1:00:27] but you know there was oh no no no no
[1:00:31] you know i was i was reading this and
[1:00:32] this is from question answers and i
[1:00:34] don't know if you some of you may have
[1:00:35] may have heard read this before but you
[1:00:37] know hey speaking of
[1:00:39] question answers
[1:00:41] and he's speaking of uh
[1:00:44] of peter and he's talking to the the
[1:00:47] early
[1:00:48] apostles there
[1:00:50] he says because your name is on the book
[1:00:52] of life because it is in heaven your
[1:00:54] name has been recognized he said that
[1:00:56] still doesn't mean you are saved
[1:01:00] your name is on the book
[1:01:03] now a lot of people put a lot of
[1:01:04] emphasis on that
[1:01:05] they've put a lot of emphasis on my name
[1:01:07] was on the lamb's book of life for the
[1:01:09] foundation of the world i was chosen in
[1:01:11] him and sometimes i still think people
[1:01:13] have getting that mixed up as he said
[1:01:14] because he says you were chosen in him
[1:01:19] not chosen of him
[1:01:22] and a lot of people still get one other
[1:01:23] point mixed up he chose you
[1:01:26] and hit you you know he came with you in
[1:01:29] him right right so you are a part of him
[1:01:33] amen
[1:01:35] he's not a part of you
[1:01:39] you were a part of him you're a part of
[1:01:41] him
[1:01:43] see people get all this mixed up they
[1:01:44] always try to make it's all me it's me
[1:01:47] me he's a part of me no
[1:01:49] go back to the beginning
[1:01:52] eve was a part of adam
[1:01:56] so you're a part of him he's not a part
[1:01:59] of you
[1:02:00] that's the reason you know you're he's
[1:02:03] not trying to match you you're trying to
[1:02:05] match him
[1:02:07] we're trying he said where i am you may
[1:02:09] be also
[1:02:12] so we're trying to go where he's at
[1:02:14] we're trying to become what he is he
[1:02:16] says you're not converted
[1:02:18] he said because your name is on the
[1:02:20] lamb's book of life because it is in
[1:02:21] heaven your name has been recognized
[1:02:23] that still doesn't mean you are saved
[1:02:25] you're not converted until you receive
[1:02:27] the holy ghost remember that you're only
[1:02:28] potentially converted
[1:02:30] he said if i ask if i if you ask me for
[1:02:33] a a oak tree and i give you an acorn
[1:02:35] potentially you have an oak tree
[1:02:37] potentially but isn't developed yet
[1:02:39] that's the reason i believe in the
[1:02:40] security as as the way i do
[1:02:43] if i ask for a cornfield and i see corn
[1:02:45] up that high potentially i have a corn
[1:02:48] field
[1:02:50] not it isn't developed yet something
[1:02:52] could happen
[1:02:54] now you're on your road through
[1:02:55] justification and sanctification to the
[1:02:57] baptism of the holy ghost but when
[1:02:59] you're genuinely baptized with the holy
[1:03:01] ghost you're in the kingdom
[1:03:03] and now you say brother branham is that
[1:03:04] true
[1:03:05] he said i don't have time to go through
[1:03:07] that
[1:03:09] he said i want you to look back here in
[1:03:10] the concordance and pick it up jesus
[1:03:12] told peter who had been saved and
[1:03:14] sanctified he trusted on jesus was
[1:03:17] sanctified saint john
[1:03:18] 17 17 he said jesus said jesus said
[1:03:21] sanctify them father through the truth
[1:03:23] thy word is the truth and he and the
[1:03:25] word
[1:03:27] is the same he said they were sanctified
[1:03:29] potentially through the truth the word
[1:03:31] the truth and then jesus told jesus or
[1:03:34] told peter the night of the betrayal he
[1:03:36] said after you are converted then
[1:03:38] strengthen your brethren
[1:03:40] then you're converted
[1:03:42] he said that man had followed him for
[1:03:44] three years and hadn't had name on
[1:03:47] lamb's book of life and had cast out
[1:03:49] devils done great works and healed and
[1:03:51] then all kind preached the word and
[1:03:53] everything and still wasn't converted
[1:03:56] see you're leading to conversion
[1:03:59] so when he told you know because he told
[1:04:01] peter he's you know because he said they
[1:04:03] came rejoicing and he said don't rejoice
[1:04:06] that the the spirits and the demons are
[1:04:08] subject to you but he said that your
[1:04:10] name is written on the book of life
[1:04:12] so you know he had all those things and
[1:04:14] he had preached the word and did all
[1:04:15] these great things and jesus had even
[1:04:17] breathed on them and told them to
[1:04:18] receive ye the holy ghost and they still
[1:04:21] hadn't received it
[1:04:24] and he had his name on the book of life
[1:04:27] and it still didn't give him the holy
[1:04:28] ghost he still wasn't born again he
[1:04:30] still wasn't converted
[1:04:34] so a lot of people they want to preach
[1:04:35] you know well i received you know
[1:04:37] because my name's on the book of life
[1:04:38] you know i came here with the seed in me
[1:04:41] and you know i was so i was so eternal
[1:04:43] and everything
[1:04:45] yeah
[1:04:46] it's mass confusion right exactly
[1:04:51] because there's one thing i still hadn't
[1:04:52] and you know wade has asked this many
[1:04:54] times and yet to have anybody really
[1:04:57] bring this to a point for anybody to
[1:04:59] understand how does god let dwell in an
[1:05:01] unclean vessel
[1:05:03] exactly
[1:05:04] if you know because if he's not going to
[1:05:07] take up his abode in you because he said
[1:05:09] he would have the holy ghost the fire of
[1:05:11] the holy ghost would come in and burn
[1:05:13] all of that out before he'd come in
[1:05:17] so he's not going to take up his
[1:05:18] residence in you until you've received
[1:05:20] that cleansing
[1:05:22] but he said peter and all of them they
[1:05:24] had received that and they still hadn't
[1:05:26] been converted
[1:05:28] so you can have all of this
[1:05:32] but you've not been converted you've not
[1:05:34] been changed
[1:05:37] and so that's the reason why there's
[1:05:38] mass confusion because until the holy
[1:05:40] ghost because brother adam said in
[1:05:42] christ the mystery he said that's the
[1:05:43] only divine ruler of the word is the
[1:05:45] holy ghost
[1:05:47] he said how big when he the holy ghost
[1:05:49] is come the spirit of truth is come he
[1:05:51] said he'll lead you and guide you into
[1:05:53] all truth
[1:05:54] until you receive that you will you
[1:05:56] can't go any further
[1:06:01] and see sometimes people you know we've
[1:06:03] had people that have had the holy ghost
[1:06:06] they i believe they're born again but
[1:06:08] they have the same problem that brother
[1:06:09] branham told the pentecostals he said
[1:06:11] you you bet cabbage down right there and
[1:06:13] he said you never went any further
[1:06:16] amen
[1:06:17] and there's lots of people they cabbage
[1:06:18] down that's it
[1:06:20] they've got on all you can't tell them
[1:06:22] nothing i don't i don't believe that
[1:06:24] that they're not children of god but you
[1:06:26] know what and because brother when you
[1:06:28] go back and you read the adoption series
[1:06:30] he said you know they were children
[1:06:32] right galatians tells us they they were
[1:06:34] children that were born and but you know
[1:06:36] what they did not come to the place that
[1:06:38] the father had for them until they come
[1:06:41] through the tudors and the schoolmasters
[1:06:42] and brought them to the place that they
[1:06:44] could receive the signet and the ring
[1:06:47] and have and receive the symbol to know
[1:06:50] where they were standing
[1:06:52] to have that bestowed upon them
[1:06:57] you know you go back through the old
[1:06:58] testament you know
[1:07:01] jacob and esau you know you know when
[1:07:03] you look at the uh
[1:07:05] the birthright
[1:07:07] you know what they still had to come
[1:07:09] even though they were the first board
[1:07:10] they still had to come to a place of
[1:07:13] learning they had to come to a place of
[1:07:15] growth to receive that birthright
[1:07:21] they just weren't given the birthright
[1:07:22] just because they were children
[1:07:27] so there had to become a time they've
[1:07:28] had they had to grow
[1:07:30] they had to work
[1:07:34] amen
[1:07:36] see sometimes we we fail to understand
[1:07:38] that's the reason it's so important to
[1:07:39] understand the foreknowledge of god to
[1:07:42] understand predestination
[1:07:47] because you know
[1:07:49] i have a
[1:07:50] friend of mine that
[1:07:52] you know
[1:07:53] he's
[1:07:55] uh he helps us out
[1:07:57] he works for heat and air company to
[1:07:59] come to work with us sometimes we have
[1:08:01] different issues stuff
[1:08:03] but he's got he's got a daughter that's
[1:08:04] 30 years old one that's 22.
[1:08:07] he's got a son that's 22. anyway and he
[1:08:10] was talking about
[1:08:11] he said all i want you know just get
[1:08:13] them out on their own i want to be on
[1:08:14] their own you know on their own on their
[1:08:17] own two feet
[1:08:21] and you know what he said they come
[1:08:22] right back he said my daughter bless her
[1:08:24] heart she's got two kids now and he said
[1:08:26] ever since she's she was 16 years old
[1:08:28] and got her first job she still ain't
[1:08:30] never learned how to handle money
[1:08:34] and you know and you stand there and he
[1:08:35] said you know i don't know what i do
[1:08:39] he said you work with them you work with
[1:08:40] them work you and you know what she
[1:08:41] comes right back
[1:08:45] and you know it's like
[1:08:47] she got a job and she got a car
[1:08:49] and i don't get too far off but you know
[1:08:52] he you know he was talking about you
[1:08:54] know she spends money on everything else
[1:08:55] and then she's oh my car got repo'd
[1:08:59] and he was like
[1:09:01] and he was like he was like okay
[1:09:04] start looking all the money where did he
[1:09:05] go oh he had this and that's
[1:09:07] like listen there's one thing you do
[1:09:09] you take care of your car
[1:09:12] but you know it's the same way
[1:09:16] it's the same growth pattern
[1:09:18] spiritually it's the same thing
[1:09:23] people go around the same mountain
[1:09:25] just like the children of israel going
[1:09:27] around the same mouth going through the
[1:09:28] same thing the same place
[1:09:34] and you know what
[1:09:35] you go places and you and you see
[1:09:37] and it
[1:09:38] and i honestly can say i've had the same
[1:09:41] thing happen to me
[1:09:42] god will come by and he'll speak
[1:09:44] something to you
[1:09:46] and you know what it's it's your word of
[1:09:48] deliverance
[1:09:50] it's your word for you to step forward
[1:09:54] for you to come beyond where you're at
[1:09:56] and you know what
[1:09:57] we miss him
[1:10:02] we have we miss him and then sometimes i
[1:10:04] wonder why i'm in the same plot why
[1:10:06] because sometimes it comes back to you
[1:10:07] it's like oh yeah
[1:10:10] sorry lord i remember that
[1:10:12] forgive me for being stupid i should
[1:10:14] have caught that
[1:10:17] he's got that big flash inside come this
[1:10:19] way step this way
[1:10:24] and we miss him so lord why don't you
[1:10:26] help me
[1:10:30] you know it's just like
[1:10:32] heard a man say one time talking about
[1:10:34] he said a lot a lot of people
[1:10:36] a lot of christians he said they're like
[1:10:38] mules
[1:10:39] they said they're hard-headed
[1:10:41] he said the you'll talk tom talks on top
[1:10:43] and you know he said the only thing that
[1:10:44] god can use to get their attention hit
[1:10:46] him with a 2x4
[1:10:48] he said hit him with a 2x4 and you know
[1:10:49] what they start singing he touched me
[1:10:52] oh he touched me
[1:10:56] but that's all but see
[1:10:57] god's trying to bring us to a place he's
[1:11:00] got your word of deliverance but you
[1:11:01] know what we'll miss it
[1:11:02] and there's lots of other people that
[1:11:04] have missed him
[1:11:08] but you know what i
[1:11:09] i thank god that we we have the ministry
[1:11:11] that we that we have here
[1:11:14] for the simple fact
[1:11:16] that you know there's people all around
[1:11:18] the world
[1:11:21] that have heard the truth
[1:11:23] there's people out there hungering for
[1:11:25] the truth
[1:11:28] and you know what we've been able to
[1:11:29] give it to them
[1:11:30] amen
[1:11:32] we've been able to bless people
[1:11:34] and whether they agree with it or not
[1:11:36] whether they do anything with it they've
[1:11:37] been able to hear
[1:11:39] they've been able to hear the truth
[1:11:43] so i thank god that we've had that in
[1:11:45] our day that god has given us the truth
[1:11:50] that we've that we've heard
[1:11:54] we'll finish up here in a minute
[1:11:56] this is from this is what i want to read
[1:11:57] christ the mystery of god revealed
[1:11:58] brother brown says
[1:12:00] look
[1:12:01] christ in you makes him the center of
[1:12:03] life of the revelation of christ
[1:12:05] life
[1:12:07] in you makes him the center of the
[1:12:08] revelation christ in the bible makes the
[1:12:10] bible a complete revelation of christ
[1:12:12] christ in you makes you the complete
[1:12:15] revelation
[1:12:16] of the whole thing
[1:12:18] see what he's trying to do what is the
[1:12:20] new birth then well brother brandon what
[1:12:21] is the new birth it is the revelation of
[1:12:23] jesus christ personally to you
[1:12:26] not that you joined a church or shook
[1:12:28] hands
[1:12:30] you called some
[1:12:31] message preacher your pastor and you
[1:12:33] said under him for x number of years
[1:12:37] i go to brother so-and-so's church
[1:12:42] but i've never anybody ever gets the
[1:12:43] idea that
[1:12:44] brother dale's my pastor
[1:12:50] they don't get you anywhere
[1:12:56] you know what a lot of people a lot of
[1:12:57] people have a lot of head knowledge have
[1:12:59] a lot of things intellectually
[1:13:04] you know what i wish everything that i
[1:13:05] had in my head was
[1:13:07] revelation
[1:13:10] glory
[1:13:11] but you know what
[1:13:12] that's not what is what it's going to
[1:13:14] take
[1:13:23] brother brown says
[1:13:29] he said but all this mystery is revealed
[1:13:32] only
[1:13:32] as he promised in the bible
[1:13:35] hell is against this truth of the
[1:13:36] revelation of this mystery but the bride
[1:13:39] is standing on it
[1:13:40] that's her stand he said why do you
[1:13:42] hunger church why do you thirst it's the
[1:13:45] father trying to reveal his hidden
[1:13:46] secret to you
[1:13:48] but he says but you let so many things
[1:13:50] get
[1:13:51] it out of you he said you let your job
[1:13:53] you let your wife you let your husband
[1:13:55] you let your children you let the cares
[1:13:57] of life you let some some pastor you let
[1:14:00] something else
[1:14:01] get that out of you
[1:14:03] when you know that the way down in your
[1:14:05] heart there's a thirsting hungry it's
[1:14:07] god trying to reveal it to you the
[1:14:09] revelation amen he said the last day is
[1:14:11] here
[1:14:12] then we can see that the marriage supper
[1:14:14] is at hand now if i never see you again
[1:14:17] remember the marriage supper is at hand
[1:14:19] then the kingdom according to the
[1:14:20] promise is ready to be issu
[1:14:22] is issued in the great millennium
[1:14:26] this is from two different places i'm
[1:14:28] sorry it's not all the same same reading
[1:14:30] but it's just two quotes together that i
[1:14:32] wanted to read the taking up of the
[1:14:34] church and the destroying of the wicked
[1:14:37] he said in the world under the sixth
[1:14:38] seal is to be purified
[1:14:40] by volcanic take away all the corruption
[1:14:42] and sin of the world
[1:14:43] and to mold her out out again and to
[1:14:46] bring forth a bright new millennium for
[1:14:47] the age that is to come when we see all
[1:14:49] these
[1:14:50] great threefold revelations god in
[1:14:52] christ christ in the church and the
[1:14:54] kingdom coming adam and eve redeem back
[1:14:56] to the garden of ede in the reserve in
[1:14:59] the representation of christ and his
[1:15:00] bride and the kingdom is going to be
[1:15:02] restored again to his promise
[1:15:05] praise be to god amen
[1:15:09] he said he's he said
[1:15:11] satan's against this mystery
[1:15:15] he said he said but we love it amen
[1:15:17] right amen and he said when the bride
[1:15:20] recognizes who she is
[1:15:22] he said she will he said that when the
[1:15:24] bride recognizes who she is he said then
[1:15:27] the rapture will go
[1:15:29] amen let's all stand up amen
[1:15:32] and that's the time that we're looking
[1:15:33] for amen
[1:15:36] i believe i believe we're in the rapture
[1:15:37] now
[1:15:38] amen amen why because we've heard the
[1:15:42] shout right yes
[1:15:45] we've heard the word amen
[1:15:47] and
[1:15:49] as the as brother branham i mean brother
[1:15:52] dale's talking about brother brown
[1:15:53] you know he spoke
[1:15:55] of a rapture taking place
[1:15:58] and then by
[1:16:00] the scripture spoke of it
[1:16:03] but by the seventh angel coming
[1:16:06] speaking of the rapture he set the
[1:16:08] things in motion amen
[1:16:10] and i believe i believe that because it
[1:16:12] took brother branham
[1:16:15] and it it took god through brother
[1:16:17] branham right i never because i
[1:16:20] understand that here i can say brother
[1:16:22] brandon brother branham and it's not a
[1:16:23] it's not an issue but i want people to
[1:16:25] understand if somebody's listening i
[1:16:26] want people to understand i'm talking
[1:16:28] about god speaking through a man i'm not
[1:16:30] speaking of just a man speaking his own
[1:16:32] intelligence
[1:16:34] but i'm speaking of
[1:16:36] of god coming down and speaking through
[1:16:38] a man
[1:16:39] to set this this thing in motion that's
[1:16:41] how this thing has been set in order to
[1:16:43] take place that we now are in the
[1:16:46] rapture
[1:16:48] he said he said what did the seventh
[1:16:49] seal do he said it was in the ushering
[1:16:51] end of the millennium
[1:16:54] they don't put us in the millennium but
[1:16:56] it puts us toward the millennium
[1:16:58] why because we have received i believe i
[1:17:00] believe we received the word
[1:17:03] i believe that angel has come down he
[1:17:04] said time shall be no more right why
[1:17:07] because we're not we're not being bound
[1:17:09] by time
[1:17:10] we have stepped into eternity
[1:17:13] why because see
[1:17:15] would you understand one thing see
[1:17:18] luther's time had
[1:17:20] had time to it luther's age why because
[1:17:23] the word was for a time
[1:17:25] right
[1:17:27] luther's time had it was for a certain
[1:17:29] time that was that was for that time
[1:17:31] wesley was for a certain time pentecost
[1:17:33] was for a certain time
[1:17:35] but you know what we received in the
[1:17:37] last day we don't have a time why was
[1:17:39] because we received eternity
[1:17:42] one because it was all of the scripture
[1:17:44] is opened up so you know what that was
[1:17:46] becoming christ coming open to us
[1:17:49] so it's become
[1:17:51] eternity
[1:17:56] because it's the fullness amen
[1:17:58] there's not going to be any anybody else
[1:18:00] beyond us exactly right
[1:18:03] glory
[1:18:05] we are the last gentiles
[1:18:08] that are going to receive the
[1:18:10] word
[1:18:12] when it leaves because when we leave out
[1:18:14] of here it's going to the jews
[1:18:17] because you know what you and i are
[1:18:19] standing in a great place we are we are
[1:18:21] blessed people right
[1:18:24] you can stand you can talk to anybody
[1:18:25] else you know what they don't see what
[1:18:27] you see
[1:18:30] you know you can talk to your blue in
[1:18:31] the face but you know what there's
[1:18:32] nobody else that's going to take a
[1:18:34] rapture but this but this endtime bride
[1:18:36] the people that have heard this word
[1:18:41] you know it takes more than but it takes
[1:18:43] more than just hearing it right it's got
[1:18:45] to become true it's got to become real
[1:18:47] to you it's got to become a revelation
[1:18:49] to you it's got it's got to become part
[1:18:52] of who you are
[1:18:55] exactly see that is that is the richest
[1:18:58] of the glory and i didn't even get i
[1:19:00] didn't even get to the scriptures in
[1:19:01] ephesians where he talks about the
[1:19:03] riches of his grace to us because that
[1:19:05] is the riches of his grace to each one
[1:19:07] of us is to see who we are to where
[1:19:10] we're standing exactly
[1:19:13] that's right
[1:19:15] see if if we ever come to the concept
[1:19:17] and and i know that we will brother
[1:19:19] madam said we will but you know if you
[1:19:21] ever come to the place to understand who
[1:19:22] you are
[1:19:25] all right
[1:19:26] see so you know because you know satan
[1:19:28] is saying just like brother bob somebody
[1:19:29] this morning
[1:19:31] you know say he's going to beat you you
[1:19:32] know
[1:19:34] you know
[1:19:36] me and by the way we were laughing this
[1:19:37] morning because you know hey we've been
[1:19:39] there we know what it's like
[1:19:43] you get up here with something and you
[1:19:45] think well i've got i've got you can
[1:19:47] have 25 pages of notes and not have
[1:19:48] nothing to say
[1:19:50] you got nothing that you get up here and
[1:19:51] you can preach for hours
[1:19:53] exactly and you know and if any any
[1:19:55] preacher ever gets up and say oh i
[1:19:56] understood all this and you know if
[1:19:58] you're not if you're if you're a
[1:19:59] minister and you ever you're up here
[1:20:01] ministering and you know you're amazed
[1:20:04] at what you say sometimes
[1:20:06] right
[1:20:07] you ask any minister that's ever ever
[1:20:09] ever just be real honest you know you're
[1:20:11] you're amazed at what you preach
[1:20:13] sometimes
[1:20:14] why because it's not you right that's
[1:20:16] right
[1:20:18] but see that it becomes us
[1:20:21] this word becomes you it becomes me
[1:20:23] if we ever come to the place we
[1:20:25] understand who we are
[1:20:29] you know it's
[1:20:30] if you have a need
[1:20:35] if you have a need you know what it's
[1:20:38] it's not
[1:20:39] i'm waiting on god lord just give me
[1:20:41] something
[1:20:43] you know what it's already inside of me
[1:20:47] exactly
[1:20:48] just says joshua you know he told the
[1:20:50] son to stand still and go back because
[1:20:52] you know he was in a fight because he
[1:20:54] was commissioned to do something you
[1:20:56] know what we are in the same we are
[1:20:58] commissioned to do something
[1:21:02] you know that's the reason you when you
[1:21:04] stand up you can pray for somebody
[1:21:07] you can call for things
[1:21:13] you know sometimes everybody say you
[1:21:15] know what you hear lots of times you
[1:21:17] know just don't don't don't jump higher
[1:21:19] than you live
[1:21:22] don't jump higher than you live now

[1:21:27] bit and get happy

[1:22:14] you know i don't think god put us down
[1:22:16] here for the only thing to make us happy
[1:22:17] is things that happen in the world
[1:22:20] right
[1:22:21] as you know as i say brother bob talk

[1:22:25] this street and the holy ghost speaking
[1:22:27] to him you know what he when he heard

[1:23:00] people some people act like they're so
[1:23:01] ashamed to raise their hands in church
