[3:46] John 1 in the beginning was the word and
[3:54] the Word was with God and the Word was
[3:57] God
[3:57] brother branham you remember in the
[3:59] unveiling I'm God he said in the
[4:02] beginning was the logos to localise with
[4:04] whistles the low cost and low cost was
[4:06] the low cost you know it was God he's
[4:07] the work so it's the same being right
[4:10] the same was in the beginning with God
[4:12] all things were made by him and without
[4:15] him was not anything made that was made
[4:17] in him was life and the life was a lot
[4:21] of men and we like shyness and darkness
[4:23] and the darkness comprehended it not he
[4:27] couldn't understand it no way then could
[4:30] it put it out right now let's go over to
[4:33] John 20 and we'll try to pick up earth
[4:39] out here 20 20 20 and when he had so
[4:46] said he showed unto them his hands and
[4:49] his side then where did the south was
[4:51] glad when they saw the Lord
[4:53] then said Jesus to them again peace be
[4:57] unto you as my father had sent me even
[5:01] so send I you and how does the father
[5:04] send you he goes in you right
[5:06] that's what he's saying I'm gonna send
[5:08] you out and you're going to come forth
[5:11] and bring the word and when he had done
[5:14] when he had said this he breathed on
[5:16] them and saith unto them receive you the
[5:19] Holy Ghost who soever sins you admit
[5:21] they are remitted unto them and
[5:23] whosoever sins you retain they are
[5:26] retained you may be seated the Lord at
[5:29] his blessing to the reading of the word
[5:32] alright now we've been covering for
[5:38] quite a while the three part thought
[5:41] that I was wanting you to be able to
[5:44] follow with us in our delivery of the
[5:47] message in trying to you know get us to
[5:50] the right place in talking about
[5:53] how that God came forth into
[5:55] manifestation I don't like to use the
[5:58] word come into being there because he
[6:01] always was into being it was not a we
[6:04] get our thoughts and our words and heard
[6:05] things like that because he always was
[6:08] but he become to condescend downward to
[6:12] be able to us to be you know to be able
[6:15] to comprehend him that was the reason he
[6:18] done the way he done all right
[6:20] then he came from that existence of self
[6:24] existing and he started condescending he
[6:28] started revealing himself is he making
[6:32] himself known and as he did he come in
[6:35] to word form and in that word form he
[6:39] then could create so then he would start
[6:44] his part of creation in life alright so
[6:48] then he came straight into the word and
[6:53] then from that word he became flesh in
[6:57] Melchizedek remember and then came forth
[7:01] into full manifestation into the Lord
[7:04] Jesus Christ alright then that's why
[7:07] that we can read the scriptures of John
[7:09] 1 Hebrews 1 Colossians 1 Ephesians 3 and
[7:15] 9 and all and say all things are created
[7:18] by Jesus Christ because that way we
[7:21] believe Jesus Christ is Almighty God the
[7:24] flesh was a flesh that was named Jesus
[7:27] but that was not the the point that this
[7:30] to his name his name was Jesus Christ
[7:34] which means Almighty God in human flesh
[7:37] alright as I've always said to you about
[7:40] it then we see him in Matthew 13 or 16
[7:44] where he says who demands stay out of
[7:46] son of man he said then when Peter fish
[7:49] he said thou art the Christ the Son of
[7:53] the Living God do you realize if he was
[7:56] the son of the Living God what did the
[7:58] prophets say the first thing that come
[8:00] out from God was God in another form
[8:03] called the word
[8:05] all the sun seas in our mind black holes
[8:10] you know and goes haywire when we think
[8:12] of a Sun but just remember you are his
[8:16] children you're his offspring your sons
[8:19] and daughters of God so why would it be
[8:21] hard to think about what he was he was
[8:24] the fullness of it that's the point I've
[8:26] been driving at sea in him dwelt the
[8:29] fullness all right in him in that word
[8:31] form that he came out to where he could
[8:33] come to create an event was the fullness
[8:36] of Almighty God all right is that hard
[8:40] to follow he was a fullness he was all
[8:42] of God all right we see you and I can
[8:45] not be all of God in one person we have
[8:48] to be part of God all right
[8:51] see then you put all the parts together
[8:53] and then you got it in the correct order
[8:55] and I love the Prophet in this statement
[8:57] of saying that the four that the Godhead
[9:00] can't be complete without you all right
[9:03] then what did we talk about Adam Adam
[9:07] being the one twenty six and twenty
[9:09] seven man to come into being in the
[9:11] image of God was a part of God right
[9:15] because Adam came forth in that point of
[9:22] the 1:26 and 27 man and that would put
[9:27] him to be there as to be Almighty God
[9:32] but the part that he was to be now not
[9:35] the fullness of God Adam wasn't all he
[9:37] wasn't the fully buddy he was his part
[9:40] all right
[9:42] the 1:26 man is a multiple form man
[9:48] because it's Almighty God we'll get to
[9:50] those things later as we try to deal
[9:53] with it all right but Sunday we were
[9:55] covering about that Adam was God's
[9:59] example son all right
[10:03] that was what God wanted was for you and
[10:07] I to come in that way you know to be the
[10:12] way that Adam was and Adam was what now
[10:15] first in creation as we talked about of
[10:18] the 1:26
[10:19] twenty-seven man in the image of God he
[10:22] was ruler of the earth right but just
[10:26] remember when he stepped over in human
[10:29] flesh he became God of the earth
[10:33] did you catch that from Sunday in other
[10:36] words when he stepped over when he was
[10:38] put that one 26 was put into human flesh
[10:40] he became the god of the earth God is
[10:44] the God of heaven but he became that was
[10:46] his domain
[10:47] it turned into a fleshly park when the
[10:51] 126th man was put into the two-seven man
[10:56] God breathing into the nostrils of Adam
[10:59] and he became a living soul that made
[11:05] him on earth as God of the earth okay
[11:11] the earth was his domain now follow that
[11:13] point as we keep going with it
[11:15] all right see then Adam being in that
[11:22] form but yet just being part of God not
[11:28] being all of God when he was put into
[11:31] human flesh he did he was not made to
[11:36] fall but by giving him free more agency
[11:42] he did fall all right now remember how
[11:45] we was doing it brother Brennan says
[11:47] from blasphemous names all right we went
[11:51] over these Sunday blasphemous names he's
[11:54] explaining the Jehovah Witness doctrine
[11:57] of how they believe that to our you
[12:00] breathe is the soul I know he said
[12:03] that's not right
[12:04] okay so then when he comes on down a
[12:07] little further watch what he said all
[12:10] right Jordan don't know but what God did
[12:14] he breathed the breath of eternal life
[12:18] now can you believe that I asked you a
[12:21] simple question do you believe the
[12:25] Prophet is right in saying that
[12:31] mm-hm now I'd ask you because point is
[12:34] if you didn't believe it I was gonna say
[12:36] there's something wrong with you because
[12:38] you couldn't believe acts 2:38 you know
[12:41] you couldn't believe Matthew 28:19 you
[12:44] couldn't believe anything else if you
[12:45] can't believe that the atom C was the
[12:51] way God was intended for you and how to
[12:53] come we would have come into existence
[13:01] and God would have breathed into our
[13:05] nostrils and would have become eternal
[13:09] in soul then we went to the Tree of Life
[13:14] and been made eternal in body that's a
[13:19] simple terminology simple thought but
[13:23] can we believe that God breathed into
[13:27] Adam eternal life and we'll get back to
[13:34] it in a minute because I want to rekey
[13:36] up the cap this to keep it in your mind
[13:37] when the Prophet would say in that blast
[13:40] theme is nice he said then you say Adam
[13:44] died now how could Adam die with eternal
[13:52] life the way we think the way we think
[13:59] if he died without eternal life I mean
[14:03] if you had eternal life and you die that
[14:05] mean you take it away from you now
[14:08] where's God and then didn't get over to
[14:10] be able to do anything no all right so
[14:15] then the prophets telling us exactly
[14:16] what happened he breathed into the
[14:19] nostrils of Adam and he became an
[14:23] eternal soul
[14:27] now that means his soul was put into
[14:30] human flesh and he saw was this
[14:34] theophany so he came theophany form in
[14:39] the basis of soul stepped in
[14:43] to eat a human flesh God breathed into
[14:48] his nostrils and he became an eternal
[14:51] soul uh-huh he turned a life put into
[14:58] the soul of Adam like I said that was
[15:01] his example child he wanted all of his
[15:05] children to be that way but then he had
[15:07] attributes he had all these other things
[15:09] I was thinking about that last night you
[15:11] think about how would you we were
[15:14] listening to the tape you think about
[15:17] let's see if I can get that thought you
[15:20] you think about that Adam God would make
[15:24] Adam eternal in his soul and even if his
[15:35] body was just stayed to be a forever
[15:38] condition or whatever you know you
[15:44] wouldn't have to put it into but you
[15:45] want to put it into eternity
[15:47] and whatever it don't mind well what if
[15:48] it stayed that way little brother said
[15:52] that the tree of life was in the garden
[15:54] to remind Adam that his youth was being
[15:56] renewed so I could have just stayed it
[15:58] away then we would come into being the
[16:10] way Adam come into being
[16:17] why would God have other thoughts then
[16:27] to have brought us that way I see you
[16:39] thinking you say well it's because he
[16:41] had other attributes that's wonderful
[16:45] and we know that did he want her to
[16:47] display but what could be greater what
[16:55] could be greater then all of mankind to
[17:03] be eternal in soul in the garden with
[17:12] his youth being renewed not getting
[17:16] older not getting any problems no devil
[17:21] no troubles what would be greater than
[17:24] that come on
[17:35] only be greater well he had attribute
[17:43] okay see now you're just making an
[17:46] answer you're not considering the
[17:49] thought you're just trying to answer by
[17:54] your amount of wording that you've heard
[17:56] before it amazes me to a kid you can
[18:01] walk up to a kid and you can say to a
[18:04] child do you want an ice cream and they
[18:07] say yes I want an ice cream they can't
[18:09] spell the word they couldn't read if he
[18:12] was rolled out in front of them but they
[18:13] know how to tell you and ice cream and
[18:15] you know what they know what an ice
[18:17] cream is right they know the difference
[18:20] in hi screaming and I thought why it's
[18:26] vocabulary implanted within them over
[18:29] time to recognize words Anna yeah you
[18:34] can see SOT what is this that words you
[18:36] got sight words see when I look down
[18:38] here I don't have to say bu T WH 81 G ot
[18:47] gone di D but now if I hand it to you a
[18:55] piece of paper written in Chinese would
[19:02] you be able to read it now some of you
[19:04] might and you don't get the point
[19:06] ninety-nine point percent and here
[19:08] wouldn't be every Chinese right well you
[19:12] know what's at words I don't mean a
[19:14] thing does it he said when he told me
[19:20] I'm trying to get you to think about
[19:23] what would be greater to God than to
[19:27] bring all of his offspring into being
[19:31] and let him stand on the earth as God of
[19:36] the earth the animals would be under
[19:41] their control there would be no death no
[19:43] sorrow there would be nothing
[19:48] now remember according to Christ the
[19:51] mission of God revealed that God had a
[19:54] plan and a purpose that he was going to
[19:57] achieve right now what is come on I weep
[20:05] over these trying to get that out what
[20:08] would be greater than to think about all
[20:10] of the children in the garden and
[20:12] everything perfect no death no sorrow no
[20:15] nothing nor whatever and God has a
[20:18] greater plan what is the greater plan
[20:35] what he had attribute okay
[20:42] an attribute no let me just shorten it
[20:52] and give you the thought this is the
[20:54] human way I think what would be greater
[20:58] than to God have all of his children
[21:01] what would be greater for you if you had
[21:03] all of your children and you just had
[21:06] them in a perfect atmosphere and a
[21:08] perfect deal anything you said that I
[21:12] want I've got a longing for something
[21:15] else
[21:15] I got a longing for my attributes to be
[21:25] displayed and look what a horrible
[21:29] situation life has been placed in what
[21:34] could be greater than his children and
[21:37] everything perfect
[21:47] because if he created us perfect he gave
[21:54] us everything to do we would not love
[22:00] him the way that we should love him for
[22:07] allowing us to come this way gonna go
[22:14] home do you understand we can talk about
[22:24] it he created us for fellowship that's
[22:27] wonderful because fellowship involved in
[22:33] sonship to a position higher than to
[22:38] just everybody being perfect and happy
[22:40] in everything do you love him
[22:47] thattaway you asked 7 8 9 10 year old
[22:55] kids that you love God and he just puts
[22:58] you through all these trouble knees oh
[23:00] no well you ask most adults that and
[23:03] they say no or I don't understand or I
[23:06] don't you know do you realize that sin
[23:14] not entered the picture we would not
[23:17] know our God only as a father only has a
[23:28] creator or you know
[23:38] he said well sure any fun to be sick no
[23:47] but you know what I think about about
[23:51] God in his ways and this is gonna be
[23:52] crazy I know and the Bible speaks of a
[23:58] woman in childbearing and it says that
[24:05] in her pain I'm paraphrasing her agony
[24:08] and things but says they joy that a
[24:14] child is born and none of your sisters
[24:22] while you were having the child unless
[24:23] you were knocked out in them you know
[24:25] and you still hurt like crazy and you
[24:27] down problems and you hurt and for then
[24:30] you didn't go through the house you know
[24:32] and and go glory I'm gonna have a baby
[24:37] I'm gonna have a baby I'm having a bad
[24:39] guy feel so good I'm hurt all over
[24:41] gonna have a baby no no he was human you
[24:49] were hurting you were crying you were in
[24:51] agony
[24:55] what takes away the pain and the
[24:59] heartaches Joyce yeah I didn't know I
[25:07] was going this way in the joy Joyce
[25:09] decided she was gonna have her children
[25:13] without you know shot sometimes or did
[25:17] you call him you know never do roles
[25:18] whatever those words are and she was
[25:21] going to go and she went through this
[25:23] long thing and Danny goes with her and
[25:26] they go and gotta know waiting them done
[25:28] it and then done Richard huh you know
[25:30] and they go and and they go through that
[25:32] training and training and all they
[25:34] telling the husband is that you just
[25:36] stand there say come on breathe
[25:38] come on Bri come on Bri come on Bri come
[25:41] on Bri come on Bri did they tell you
[25:46] what you were training the net did you
[25:48] get down and hold you off the holder
[25:50] honey I love you
[25:51] you're the sweetest thing they didn't
[25:53] tell you that did he only told you tell
[25:56] her to breathe right I mean that filing
[25:59] I was just okay Danny keeps saying
[26:06] breathe John you know what George does
[26:13] here I can see that you're I wouldn't
[26:18] know everything the shut up get out of
[26:21] here I breathe on my own she wasn't too
[26:29] happy but when that little Jacob oh come
[26:34] on
[26:34] and that little baby and you hold it
[26:39] pain starts going away Joss is not
[26:44] telling Danny I told you back out of the
[26:49] leaf she send any look that's sweet
[26:53] oh it's wonderful look at the little one
[26:59] you understand I know I'm crazy the way
[27:03] I think about things but see if if
[27:10] you're not having to I know you're gonna
[27:13] maybe differ with my approach when I'm
[27:14] just sorry I said something there the
[27:18] other day and maybe you don't even think
[27:19] about it
[27:20] I said it about Gail and I said just
[27:25] together I said just think somebody one
[27:26] of these days up in glory would be
[27:28] talking and they look at you and I say
[27:30] if you hadn't come I wouldn't be here
[27:35] because we hadn't fallen they would have
[27:38] not been any foolish virgins and people
[27:40] like that or anything I wouldn't kidding
[27:44] the people will say if you hadn't have
[27:47] fallen
[27:49] well you're sounding like you're making
[27:51] the fall some glory some something I've
[27:54] tried to explain what I'm making the
[27:56] having the baby is not the thing it's
[28:00] when the baby gets here right so is
[28:03] everybody with me
[28:05] it's not that part it's not joyous that
[28:09] God was looking back and soon one of my
[28:11] kids are gonna fall and when they fall
[28:12] I'm gonna do what the rest my stuff no
[28:14] he knew everything he knew everybody
[28:16] would be here
[28:24] Adam was his example child but then Adam
[28:30] fell but did he fall to death yes
[28:40] because the Prophet said he did but he
[28:46] said for he died did he had a lamb I
[28:52] emphasized if you remember Sunday that
[28:55] Adam lived 930 years you know so it
[29:12] wasn't the fact that Adam and Eve done
[29:13] wrong abloom Adam fell over no cuz we
[29:21] don't consider what the truth of all of
[29:23] it is I don't never died and went to
[29:27] hell
[29:30] you can't give Adam eternal life and
[29:33] take it away God not an Indian giver to
[29:40] do those things brother Branham and
[29:43] blasphemous names he said Adam died
[29:53] but he couldn't leave him and you know
[29:56] he couldn't just let him fall over and
[29:58] die and he certainly couldn't put him in
[30:01] hell Adam fell from the Prophet said
[30:13] eternal life well you're just trying to
[30:18] interpret what he's saying I'd love to
[30:21] hear you tell me some other way come on
[30:26] you tell me some other way to keep this
[30:29] thing straight to work you can't have
[30:31] him died and going to hell if he had
[30:37] eternal life there's no way you could
[30:39] put eternal life in hell so he never
[30:43] died that way he physically died that
[30:54] 126 man I kept emphasizing the Sunday
[30:57] the 126 man he can't do wrong he's in
[31:02] God's image
[31:03] God likeness you can't see him that way
[31:09] so the sin could not have come into
[31:12] existence while Adam and Eve were in
[31:15] that theophany situation of eternal life
[31:20] they had to be put into human flesh for
[31:24] something to take place so just remember
[31:27] then Adam never he died physically and
[31:32] when he died physically he put every one
[31:36] of us into death you remember us reading
[31:42] it is it enough that the Prophet would
[31:44] say okay
[31:50] the lamb was provided for Adam because
[31:55] already in his nostrils had become the
[31:59] breath of the eternal God and he became
[32:04] a living soul he was a son of God that
[32:14] was Adams that was God's plan for all of
[32:17] us but couldn't go back to in a second
[32:20] do you understand let's see can I say
[32:33] something like this just a Gail sister
[32:36] Gail told me a story that happened one
[32:38] time and I had me I had a little bit
[32:42] just fun but since the Gail was a
[32:44] spoiled brat she okay yes she was she
[32:47] was talking about it yesterday or no no
[32:49] she was talking about they had
[32:51] everything they didn't worry about it
[32:53] they could just go down to the grocery
[32:54] store and this say gimme
[32:56] and they didn't daddy paid it later that
[32:59] she's bought okay all right but she was
[33:03] complaining to her mother about
[33:07] something that she didn't have shoes
[33:10] okay her mother just took her in the
[33:14] other room and there was her daddy
[33:18] sitting with his feet up on the Ottoman
[33:21] I guess that what you call those things
[33:23] or situation she just pointed because
[33:28] her daddy would give her anything in the
[33:29] world but there he said with a hole in
[33:33] the bottom of his shoe he could see the
[33:37] socks the hole that took care of the new
[33:41] part shoes you know why because she's
[33:44] seen daddy loved her I'm trying to get
[33:49] you to think about why God would allow
[33:53] this thing to continue beyond the fact
[33:55] of just bringing us here as a family or
[33:59] just bringing us here as people and
[34:01] letting us be for
[34:03] rats and just live in the garden and big
[34:06] rule of everything never have to worry
[34:09] about nothing with something greater
[34:13] than that would be in the mind of God
[34:17] didn't in his mind he could see his
[34:20] children he could look down and see his
[34:23] children and he said even though I put
[34:26] him through all of this trouble I put
[34:29] him through all these heartaches and
[34:30] trials my children will come out of this
[34:34] loving me that's what he wants that's
[34:43] what he wanted was his family to love
[34:48] him you look at your children and you
[34:58] see them do wrong you said what I said
[35:02] it's not like my child but then you get
[35:09] to thinking about hey you know what I
[35:11] remember when I was about that age and
[35:14] when I done it didn't begins to change
[35:17] don't it all right get the story
[35:20] Adam was God's plan and purpose the God
[35:27] wanted his other attributes to be
[35:28] brought in to be displayed and he wanted
[35:31] his children to love him do you love him
[35:38] cuz you're not going to hell
[35:47] do you love him because he has given you
[35:49] everything because remember those
[36:01] attributes that he wanted displayed one
[36:09] of those attributes was to be a father
[36:11] but one of them was to be a son that
[36:16] could pay the price one of them was to
[36:19] be the holy ghost come on I'm quoting
[36:24] brother branham order if you wanted I'll
[36:26] be glad to give him tea he said he had
[36:28] an attribute of being son he had an
[36:32] attribute of being God he had an
[36:35] attribute of all of these things see we
[36:37] just say attribute God the God is a word
[36:41] about God's word you know ever how you
[36:42] say word because it could mean anything
[36:46] and that's true but remember the word
[36:51] God is also the greatest word that could
[36:53] be brought in the English language
[36:56] because he's my god
[37:04] but follow the point all of those other
[37:10] attributes would have never come into
[37:12] being and we would have never loved him
[37:16] as we do how much did brother Branham
[37:23] love God he said and I remember this one
[37:30] the first time he was saying it he said
[37:35] if when it comes to the end of the road
[37:37] and said I have to die and go to hell
[37:41] I'm paraphrasing it's close he said I
[37:47] can go by and say father thank you I
[37:50] love you can you say you love him for
[37:57] allowing you to go through the pain the
[38:00] agony Zand trials and heartaches and
[38:02] troubles or do you love him because your
[38:08] dear poor brat and he's took care of
[38:09] y'all let's see when is it abraham
[38:16] dreaming the other day when he said I
[38:19] know Abraham will teach his children
[38:22] right he said I know Abraham will teach
[38:27] his children what to love him for what
[38:31] he is know what it could be I notice not
[38:39] using job is Jonah
[38:40] Oh God God you know it and I know it you
[38:46] wouldn't go and destroy them people you
[38:48] know like that if I could have got you
[38:51] to dealt on five more you wouldn't have
[38:53] destroyed nothing that part then there
[38:55] it had to stop he said I know that you
[38:58] do you're not gonna Jonah he said you're
[39:01] not getting all the stories tied
[39:04] together to get it right listen
[39:08] so if Adam was God's example child
[39:13] that's what he wants for all over and
[39:14] brother branham it's in here we read we
[39:17] read around and said
[39:18] one day the sons of God will come back
[39:20] to that same place that Adam existed
[39:23] cause see now what I'm saying most of
[39:26] our thinking most of you are thinking
[39:28] was the fact that Genesis 1:26 and 27
[39:30] was the spirit man that would rule the
[39:33] garden did you ever consider that that
[39:36] spirit man was put into Adam and Adam
[39:38] rule the garden Adam the human flesh man
[39:49] Adam that's why the Bible calls us we
[39:55] are the god of this earth we are his
[40:00] people what about it the brother Brown
[40:09] gets into the seal book and he says but
[40:11] Adam died City he fell from eternal life
[40:20] well how can you fall from eternal life
[40:26] that's what I don't understand I'm
[40:28] honest I'm sorry to put this out because
[40:30] it'll throw the devil in that line
[40:32] you'll start using it I don't understand
[40:34] the people who dismiss these preachers
[40:35] in this mess ain't got enough sense to
[40:37] preach if I was gonna preach against
[40:39] bread around them I'd preach on that
[40:41] right time I'd give you all of the
[40:43] things we're brother Brennan said Adam
[40:45] died and then said come on now you tell
[40:49] me if Adam died he went to hell and if
[40:52] he fell from eternal life you definitely
[40:54] put him in hell where else could you put
[40:59] him what are you following me
[41:05] Adam physically died to fulfill the Word
[41:09] of God that the other attributes could
[41:14] start coming into being right and that
[41:20] attribute would first start off as being
[41:24] that God made an atonement he took the
[41:27] skins off of them animals
[41:30] and give them to Adam and Eve to live
[41:32] and cover them
[41:45] think about it Adam never died and went
[41:52] to hell you can't do that there's
[41:54] there's no such thing as having eternal
[41:56] life and then being able to lose it
[41:59] now we'll get to in the message of the
[42:02] new birth we'll get to the point that
[42:04] you can make a confession but a
[42:06] confession is different than a
[42:08] possession a confession of eternal life
[42:11] is not eternal life a possession of
[42:15] eternal life is eternal life all right
[42:18] we'll get down to those thing but you
[42:21] see what I'm talking about brother
[42:22] Branham said he said you come like Adam
[42:26] like me and he said Adam and the way it
[42:32] came it's and who is this well said it
[42:33] was reading Adam came the correct way
[42:41] that was the 126 man that eternal life
[42:45] the creation of man and then put him
[42:47] into flash that's the correct way that
[42:52] was the way God wanted it what you see
[43:00] we didn't come that away now you hear
[43:03] what brother Branham used and that's the
[43:05] title of the message did not we bypass
[43:08] the word Adam came the word remember he
[43:15] was the god of the earth he was ruler oh
[43:16] you think he didn't have a pretty good
[43:18] vocabulary he named all the animals okay
[43:21] that sounded like it you must have been
[43:23] pretty smart
[43:29] let's see you and I didn't come down
[43:31] away little random use it two or three
[43:34] times and who is this male charity and
[43:37] he says we bypassed the word
[43:44] Jesus came word to flesh Adam came word
[43:48] to flesh the part that Adam was to be he
[43:52] came the part of God he was to be word
[43:55] that part and then he became flesh which
[44:00] you see we bypassed coming the word to
[44:04] stand our and a word body I'm quoting if
[44:06] you want to put them up we'll read it we
[44:09] bypass that word falling body the
[44:13] theophany and we came to flesh to be
[44:18] tempted he said we bypassed this is one
[44:23] coma we bypass coming the way God did
[44:26] now listener bypass is not 285 run
[44:29] around Atlanta I always say that you
[44:31] know cuz you don't get like old Perez
[44:33] woods you don't run get lost you keep
[44:34] going around and around and around and
[44:35] around by Pais doesn't mean what we put
[44:40] it down as a point
[44:41] what about patch means it's dark but we
[44:44] go around dig well why did we go around
[44:48] it I mean if it was the higher why
[44:59] didn't we go that away see then what we
[45:04] done we by Pais coming the way God came
[45:08] word and in the flesh we bypass coming
[45:13] the way Adam came word one 26 or 27
[45:17] flesh we came straight to flesh right to
[45:28] be tempted of sin we're back up in the
[45:31] message cuz we're gonna get Adam and
[45:32] what really the fall was in the garden
[45:35] but the point I want you to cover with
[45:38] me brother Brennan said it was the word
[45:40] we we didn't come word he said we bypass
[45:44] coming to word he said we become the
[45:47] word here
[45:49] you remember that we become the word
[45:52] here and how do you become the word
[45:56] Easter seed you become the word as you
[45:58] receive the word what is the new birth
[46:04] it's a revelation of Jesus Christ
[46:06] personally to you what the revelation of
[46:10] the word of God personally to you so we
[46:16] didn't come like God came from word to
[46:18] flesh we didn't come like a Adam from
[46:21] word of the party was I keep saying that
[46:24] part where you won't get tied up in the
[46:25] wrong time the party was to be he became
[46:29] that put in flesh extending her perfect
[46:35] right but then he fell and when he did
[46:42] right around and said to steelbook he
[46:43] said that put us all on the other side
[46:45] of the chasm Adam's sin put us all on
[46:51] the other side of the chasm he said
[46:55] bring us to death bring us to the place
[47:00] that don't try to talk about having an
[47:07] eternal Center I know I get arrogant and
[47:12] sarcastic so a lot of times in the
[47:14] statements I make about the ministers
[47:16] and the way they go but I'm sorry if God
[47:18] forgive me you forgive me just put that
[47:21] all behind but people say but I come
[47:25] with eternal life
[47:27] I've got quotes from the Prophet did I
[47:30] come with eternal life I got folks in
[47:33] the Prophet it did Adam fell for me what
[47:38] are we gonna do fight quotes are you
[47:45] good that's what it's been for all these
[47:49] years is to fight in the quotes - so let
[47:52] me sold that so that so what was this
[47:54] what was that what was its no what was
[47:55] that what was that how many nights how
[47:57] many what
[47:57] just keep running
[48:04] but listen Church do you believe I'm
[48:10] gonna try to cut this part down because
[48:15] do you fell from the position or bypass
[48:20] the position of coming you by Pais
[48:24] coming the way God came you by Pais
[48:26] coming and I'm say we well we bypass the
[48:29] word but we become the word here and how
[48:34] do you become the word you become the
[48:36] word as you receive the word now here's
[48:42] one to listen to brother branham
[48:45] emphatically States
[48:46] two or three times that you bypass your
[48:49] theophany sin who dis melchester come
[48:53] straight to flesh and by Pais that word
[48:55] cuz that's what he's calling the word a
[48:57] theophany
[49:00] here's one I love who's this Melchizedek
[49:04] paragraph 88 then after you could
[49:08] recognize the very word of God with eCos
[49:10] food then you left the other thing you
[49:16] have then been formed into the living
[49:18] image of the Living God you heard from
[49:26] your theophany when did you hear if you
[49:32] earth evening
[49:38] though unless after we get into messy
[49:39] night with that goes with double form
[49:42] because it will cover it here into this
[49:45] and has to be covered but when you
[49:49] receive the new birth that was the birth
[49:53] of the word and by receiving the new
[49:56] birth you heard from your theophany you
[50:00] know why because you was a sinner before
[50:03] then lost but then one day you received
[50:08] eternal life not Church receiving
[50:16] eternal life what about it what about
[50:27] receiving eternal life but around says
[50:35] on the message that token the word is
[50:38] the promise and the word is God and the
[50:42] word is ours and we become the word and
[50:46] the word becomes us what a great
[50:53] statement what about it by the fall of
[50:59] Adam brother Brendan tells us over and
[51:02] over we can't blame Adam we're on a free
[51:05] moral agency deal and we don't blame
[51:07] Adam right it's not their fault it's our
[51:10] fault right so let's get a way of
[51:12] thinking well it wouldn't if they had
[51:14] done we wouldn't of done earlier you
[51:15] ain't getting the story and you surely
[51:17] ain't listening to what I spent half an
[51:20] hour while ago trying to get you to
[51:22] realize that the fact that to follow
[51:24] brought into being things from God that
[51:29] you and I would have never known an
[51:34] existence of parenthood that would have
[51:38] never been understood in existence and
[51:41] the thoughts of loving God because of
[51:43] what he has done for us would have never
[51:46] come into being
[51:47] I did not Ben
[51:49] I preached a message one time I remember
[51:53] years ago and some people they liked at
[51:55] it but it was called a blessing of a
[51:57] blemish somewhere you may remember
[52:01] blessings of a blemish you realize the
[52:05] blemish kept a lot of lambs would be
[52:07] killed there's a blessing visible image
[52:13] well you know what that's coming into
[52:16] existence like we did as I said had
[52:18] brought out a lot of the attributes of
[52:20] God and he's going to look down at us
[52:22] and say I don't see your blemishes he
[52:31] says come unto me o ye that labor and
[52:39] heavy laden and I'll give you rest you
[52:47] don't deserve it nothing else but I'll
[52:49] give it to you you went into the world
[52:53] and because of your sin and your doing I
[52:56] was able to display and look at all of
[52:58] these other people that are here in the
[53:00] world that one day I'm going to give a
[53:02] lot of them eternal life not glorying in
[53:06] the fall but fall hadn't to come they
[53:11] wouldn't be here so the blessings are
[53:14] there alright now I'm going to cover
[53:19] something that I'll have to cover in a
[53:20] two-part as to one day when it will be
[53:23] covered in the statue of a perfect man
[53:25] so remember that as I'm saying it we
[53:28] will to cover it in first into this part
[53:30] tonight what about that new birth but
[53:39] it's a wonderful thing to think about
[53:41] the new birth as being the birth of the
[53:42] word the words you heard I believe then
[53:47] did you come with a seed in you now not
[53:52] like it's taught in the message I'm
[53:56] talking about a seed which is the world
[54:00] because I believe every born-again
[54:03] believer was a part of the Word of God
[54:06] before the foundation of the world and
[54:11] they succeed for every age to be made
[54:14] manifest right it's not sieved like
[54:18] these others they got to put a little
[54:19] spot here put a little spot there I put
[54:21] little dots here
[54:21] oh look at those little dots I just see
[54:24] myself I'm running little dots I don't
[54:28] want to be a dog I want to be a child of
[54:32] God I want to love my father because of
[54:37] the way he's done me then you'll
[54:40] understand why I make that statement
[54:42] that you think I'm stupid crazy idiot
[54:45] everything in the world when I say I
[54:47] wouldn't change my name for all the
[54:49] money in the world because my name is me
[54:57] well I could change my name still be me
[54:59] you sold your birthright
[55:04] you're a nice aw give me a morsel of
[55:08] food come on brother Dale can preach
[55:11] sometimes you'd want to be like Esau
[55:15] with a morsel of food something to eat
[55:17] to keep you from dying good morning God
[55:23] to come into this heart so much until
[55:26] it'll take every fiber of my being
[55:28] and take me in the rapture what does it
[55:33] mean to be born again
[55:43] Adam was God's original plan you agree
[55:48] with that you agree cause a prophet you
[55:50] know you need to find him he's that was
[55:52] God's way that he wanted to bring it and
[55:55] how did he bring him in a marvelous way
[56:03] he created a body no Jesus 2:7 and he
[56:13] just simply breathed into the nostrils
[56:18] of that man Adam eternal life right what
[56:27] did he do he put two 1:26 9:27 into two
[56:31] seven is that the way the prophets did
[56:33] it happen Adam didn't have eternal life
[56:38] in his body he didn't have eternal life
[56:41] in his spirit he only had eternal life
[56:42] in his soul because that was the way God
[56:44] meant for it to be what about you what
[56:52] is the new birth well this is a new
[56:57] birth brother branham Christ the mystery
[56:59] of God reveal relation of Jesus Christ
[57:00] personal to you and he said that's what
[57:02] the church is built on is the revelation
[57:04] of Jesus Christ that is the new birth
[57:13] how did you get the new birth and how
[57:20] did you get the new birth
[57:24] but I just went to church one day ayah I
[57:30] thought what I didn't go challenge maybe
[57:33] you like I would 18 years old and I said
[57:37] well my wife won't go women nowheres
[57:42] else we'll have to go to church and she
[57:44] wouldn't so we went to church hey boys
[57:50] and girls were I don't know what is like
[57:52] him and there was no way was I sitting
[57:55] there enjoying what that preacher had to
[57:56] say I wanted him to shut up
[57:59] I won't even team to say let's stand
[58:04] right I'm a human
[58:07] you'd be goody-goody oh you won't - and
[58:10] sweetie sweetie but you just lied so
[58:12] forget it I went to church what did you
[58:20] do I met guard 1011 years old so then
[58:25] there's no organ right where there was a
[58:27] garden hike
[58:28] ain't no problem I don't care but you
[58:32] see I was wanting to find that God I
[58:33] won't find that garden now you won't
[58:36] believe this but I won't find that guard
[58:38] as much as I was that girl sitting
[58:39] beside him because he was on my mind as
[58:43] much the time as she was except you know
[58:45] what I mean boys and girls and he loved
[58:47] you okay human beings all right
[58:53] what you see I would think about that I
[58:59] would think about God and I'd wonder and
[59:08] one day I've heard it taught and read
[59:12] enough to note it said that I had to
[59:14] accept him as my savior you ever done
[59:16] that there was what was taught you
[59:20] accept him as your Savior you believe in
[59:22] your heart confess with your mouth and
[59:24] you're saved no I'm not throwing off on
[59:28] nobody Church because that's what God
[59:30] was he he dwelt with the people during
[59:32] all those times of the way they told it
[59:34] don't think I'm throwing off on God
[59:37] all he was waiting on somebody who could
[59:39] come and tell us the truth and who was
[59:42] our waiting on I was waiting on somebody
[59:45] could tell me about a God that I knew
[59:48] was real that I knew existed that he was
[59:53] real and I begin to read what this man
[1:00:00] said he began to talk about in God as
[1:00:04] being real he began to tell about how
[1:00:09] real he was how he condescended to
[1:00:12] mankind and how and I thought here's a
[1:00:15] man talking about the God that I've been
[1:00:18] looking for but you see I wasn't like
[1:00:26] everybody else I didn't count my new
[1:00:30] birth as the day I saw God I didn't
[1:00:35] count I didn't count the new birth is
[1:00:39] the three times that's all man in my
[1:00:41] house there's an angel I didn't count
[1:00:45] that is my new birth I heard a man
[1:00:54] talking about a birth and he said a lot
[1:00:59] of us Baptist believes and we got it
[1:01:02] Lord of us method this shout it and we
[1:01:04] got it
[1:01:05] a lot of us Pentecostal spoke in tongues
[1:01:08] and God he said but a lot of them didn't
[1:01:10] get it why when my Bible said if I
[1:01:16] believe and I'll say it he's got to save
[1:01:20] me it's his problem is that the way the
[1:01:24] world types of salvation is his problem
[1:01:27] to do then we come up to the prophet and
[1:01:30] we hear him say he said you accepted
[1:01:34] Jesus Christ but said did he accept you
[1:01:45] did
[1:01:46] except you that's why that I was two
[1:01:52] years in this message before I would and
[1:01:58] I was prayed far by every preacher and I
[1:01:59] could get I was counseled by everybody
[1:02:03] could be thought of you know talking
[1:02:06] because I'd ask questions talk to people
[1:02:11] brother mote one day he said Sam he said
[1:02:15] I don't know what's your hunting I said
[1:02:18] you ain't the only one that don't know
[1:02:19] what I'm up
[1:02:20] I said code I don't know what I'm not
[1:02:24] he's talking about signs evidences doing
[1:02:27] verse or whatever
[1:02:28] I knew we could fellowship he said was
[1:02:34] only one thing I want to tell you he
[1:02:39] said I've always tried to teach you and
[1:02:41] the church that God is a person I see
[1:02:46] yes sir oh the days and wonders of him
[1:02:50] standing here reading over and over and
[1:02:52] if brother mote said God is is God he
[1:02:55] read it right and we rode the country
[1:02:59] and and I learned the book so much too
[1:03:01] he could call out greatest battle ever
[1:03:03] fought and I would pull out the color of
[1:03:05] the book and hand it to him he I didn't
[1:03:07] have to search I knew it took my heart I
[1:03:10] was still hunting and remote I don't
[1:03:13] know either I said I know the fact that
[1:03:17] we're shouting speaking in tongues and
[1:03:19] all of these things I said you know my
[1:03:21] background of what we've talked he said
[1:03:26] but God is a person yes sir
[1:03:31] and he said the birth is the birth of
[1:03:34] the word that you hear said yes sir he
[1:03:39] said then quit trying to seek any sign
[1:03:41] of wonder or whatever and he said you
[1:03:44] just nail yourself down to that word and
[1:03:47] stay there
[1:03:53] probably another year or so Pais we were
[1:03:58] down in Athens no hollyhocks and brother
[1:04:06] moat was up preaching I don't know
[1:04:07] member who was well but it was kind of
[1:04:10] comical coach nanny come up will be
[1:04:13] prayed for and I came up to be prayed
[1:04:15] for and and the Holy Spirit hit both of
[1:04:18] us and I fell one way and she fell the
[1:04:20] other way and she fell slap under this
[1:04:22] drunk and they was a ladies was grabbing
[1:04:26] her dress and putting everything in
[1:04:28] fixing and the old drunk its he's trying
[1:04:32] to figure out what was going on but you
[1:04:37] see I rose that day knowing one time the
[1:04:43] new birth is the birth of the word the
[1:04:49] revelation of Jesus Christ personally to
[1:04:51] you and you see if your experience won't
[1:04:56] start your birth and end in a rapture
[1:04:59] your experience is not right you're
[1:05:03] looking for signs and wonders or this or
[1:05:05] that or the other you looking for
[1:05:06] something that's not dark look to the
[1:05:09] word and see the word go now remember
[1:05:17] one time Adams started as a full-grown
[1:05:24] man right you agree he wouldn't obey
[1:05:28] being groped early as full-grown men
[1:05:29] when God starts things he starts his
[1:05:32] full-grown when he started the church on
[1:05:36] the Deaf Pentecost he didn't start it
[1:05:40] here
[1:05:40] he started it right here where it says
[1:05:42] Holy Spirit down the headstone had been
[1:05:45] rejected we know the whole mess is the
[1:05:47] story that's why the Bible speaks then
[1:05:52] all the prophethood
[1:05:53] or the faith of the Father he started
[1:05:57] his church off with a group of people
[1:06:00] that had heard the word for three years
[1:06:03] in a high
[1:06:07] there was no novice in the upper room
[1:06:10] with a hundred and twenty novices and
[1:06:14] things downstairs were the three
[1:06:16] thousand the beginners just heard one
[1:06:18] message those in the upper room were
[1:06:20] trained and tutored by the Lord Jesus
[1:06:24] and so great was his doings until Judas
[1:06:27] was up there and like Wade was saying
[1:06:31] Sunday we don't want to agree that what
[1:06:35] the Prophet says Judas was justified he
[1:06:38] said Judas was sanctified said what he
[1:06:42] liked was the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:06:44] he was sitting in the upper room because
[1:06:48] of what had brought him to the upper
[1:06:50] room then the devil enters him and he
[1:06:54] fills out the whole thing right but the
[1:06:59] church started on the day of Pentecost
[1:07:00] it's full grown children
[1:07:07] what is that statement brother Henry
[1:07:10] Green says God started his church the
[1:07:12] way he wanted and he wants to what
[1:07:14] church the way he started it if I miss
[1:07:16] that it's pretty close so go ahead and
[1:07:21] now brothers in the room there if you
[1:07:23] will jump over to number 10 on the notes
[1:07:26] and we'll get started and finished cause
[1:07:30] remember Adam was born by the breath of
[1:07:37] God in a nod at the scripture we read
[1:07:46] that Jesus gathered with him in the
[1:07:48] upper room after his resurrection and he
[1:07:53] was there talking with him and he
[1:07:57] breathed on them and said receive ye the
[1:07:59] Holy Ghost
[1:08:07] three or four days weeks or whatever
[1:08:09] later they finally received it brother
[1:08:14] branham I've got it right here laying
[1:08:15] before me so don't holler and scream
[1:08:17] about it brother Branham says on the
[1:08:19] message questions and answers in 64 dear
[1:08:25] brother Brannon what is the difference
[1:08:26] when Jesus breathed owner to shop and
[1:08:28] said receive the Holy Ghost and when
[1:08:30] that they had to go to the upper room to
[1:08:32] tarry it was a promise and when he
[1:08:39] breathed on him was a promise he gave
[1:08:43] them could have standing preach a little
[1:08:47] bit about a hat put he telling what he
[1:08:51] done without him he promised a promise
[1:08:57] it's you and I would come that same way
[1:09:01] like he can okay said receive you the
[1:09:08] Holy Ghost and when they do it was a
[1:09:09] promise to them breathed upon them his
[1:09:12] promise said receive you the Holy Ghost
[1:09:15] it was a promise they went to the upper
[1:09:17] room to wait for the promise to will be
[1:09:20] fulfill the same thing is when you lay
[1:09:23] hands upon you when we lay hands upon
[1:09:26] you to be healed then you go on about
[1:09:29] your business waiting for the promise to
[1:09:32] be fulfilled what about Adam starting
[1:09:36] off we only look at him as he fell he
[1:09:42] was standing there with the promise are
[1:09:49] you with Adam
[1:09:53] standing there with a promise that a
[1:09:55] church was gonna come the same way that
[1:09:58] he would come you don't go back to who
[1:10:00] this Melchizedek we're brought around
[1:10:02] and said he said when they've done that
[1:10:05] he said that shows that ever son in the
[1:10:06] end is going to remember how I
[1:10:08] emphasized I've read around and said God
[1:10:10] a male charity meeting male charity was
[1:10:13] the way ever born-again believers gonna
[1:10:14] come they meet the word here
[1:10:18] so let's read drop-back now you've got
[1:10:23] that one drawback blasphemous names come
[1:10:30] on back the church is the mystical body
[1:10:37] of Christ born of the breath of God oh
[1:10:43] do you get it congregation says amen the
[1:10:48] Church of God is born of the breath of
[1:10:50] God God breathed into the nostrils
[1:10:55] spiritually of Adam and he became a
[1:10:58] living soul if you know the Pentecostals
[1:11:03] are the true Pentecostal church is born
[1:11:05] of the breath of God let me read
[1:11:10] something to you administering let's see
[1:11:12] just a minute st. John bring it on up
[1:11:14] because if he's covering you know what
[1:11:15] the promise alright let me read you and
[1:11:17] see whether the church is born into the
[1:11:19] breath of God or not like Adam was in
[1:11:22] the beginning
[1:11:22] Oh like Adam was you realize your new
[1:11:32] birth is exactly the same way that Adam
[1:11:35] started out he's going to give you the
[1:11:42] word you take the word it said about to
[1:11:46] the side when they took the word and
[1:11:47] held it and the Holy Ghost come on and
[1:11:51] their pineco licks a fire set upon each
[1:11:57] one of them tongues of fire they
[1:12:01] received the new birth
[1:12:04] I didn't write the book I just love to
[1:12:09] read it let us see whether the church is
[1:12:13] born to the breath of God or not like
[1:12:15] Adam was in the beginning now let's see
[1:12:17] if he was then he goes to same day of
[1:12:19] the week when we read it come on up we
[1:12:21] read the scripture in John and he shows
[1:12:23] his disciples and he said he breathed on
[1:12:25] them and said receive you the Holy Ghost
[1:12:29] Church born of the breath of God that's
[1:12:34] why when you come in a statue of a
[1:12:35] perfect man we got to come right back to
[1:12:36] the same quote but you got to get it
[1:12:38] here because the statement is down here
[1:12:40] okay you say oh that's just a dollar
[1:12:43] that's it okay
[1:12:45] go ahead do what you want to just don't
[1:12:46] wait and see when we get it together and
[1:12:48] watch it when this stature has molded
[1:12:51] assess a variant condition god breathes
[1:12:53] breath upon then receive you the Holy
[1:12:56] Ghost and remember to show you mine Ron
[1:12:58] the disciples had three years of
[1:13:00] training before the Holy Ghost came so
[1:13:05] arguing with the Prophet what does he
[1:13:07] say receive you the Holy Ghost
[1:13:09] then you are a son of God watch him you
[1:13:12] join anything you won't tell but you're
[1:13:15] born into the Church of the Living God
[1:13:17] in other words he's saying you ain't
[1:13:19] going to join no church right he ain't
[1:13:23] saying go join the churches everything's
[1:13:24] okay join them churches the Bible says
[1:13:28] come out of her he ain't telling you
[1:13:32] he's telling you that you could do it if
[1:13:35] you want to cuz you ain't gonna won't -
[1:13:40] you mean right now that you would go
[1:13:43] home and quit church and start going to
[1:13:45] the Baptist Church next - you need just
[1:13:48] go over them and when I have to go to
[1:13:54] church then you're a son of God you join
[1:13:58] anything you want to but you're born
[1:13:59] into the Church of the Living God born
[1:14:01] by the breath of God God breathed upon
[1:14:03] them and said receive you the whole ago
[1:14:05] we receive he we the Holy Ghost
[1:14:08] oh my there you are he said not come and
[1:14:11] join put your name on there with your
[1:14:13] soaks up soup suppers and all that going
[1:14:15] going in Lord
[1:14:17] you can join a Methodist Baptist large
[1:14:20] anything you won't do but you're joining
[1:14:22] but you've joining a lodge but when you
[1:14:27] become a child of God you are born by
[1:14:34] the breath of God we pick that up on
[1:14:38] adoption when we get back to it but just
[1:14:40] remember the same Holy Ghost that fell
[1:14:48] in the upper room and gave 120 the new
[1:14:53] birth was the same Holy Ghost it
[1:14:56] breathed on 3000 outside and they
[1:15:01] received the new birth 120 got it faith
[1:15:07] of the father's brother Brennan said
[1:15:11] they had these virtues 120 got that but
[1:15:17] to 3,000 outside heard some of them one
[1:15:19] sermon they started off babies just
[1:15:25] remember what I say it Adam was God's
[1:15:29] original plan for man the fall didn't
[1:15:34] though nothing on God it brought about
[1:15:36] all in the way he wanted and should
[1:15:38] bring all of his children to loving God
[1:15:41] for the way he's done for them then
[1:15:47] start off with Adam as a baby like the
[1:15:51] stupidity of mankind arguing over which
[1:15:54] came first the chicken or the egg the
[1:16:02] Bible said God created but it could
[1:16:05] created eggs and let me know see you're
[1:16:08] not willing to listen you're just
[1:16:09] arguing philosophies remember he started
[1:16:14] his church and brother branham I
[1:16:16] wouldn't want it made it he said the
[1:16:17] church is born like Adam do you realize
[1:16:23] what happened to you then when that new
[1:16:26] birth came you took the word and you
[1:16:29] held on to it and you say Lord this is
[1:16:31] it thank you this is it Lord you know
[1:16:38] what he done when he breathed on you he
[1:16:40] just simply gave life to the brook to
[1:16:41] the word right you took the word and
[1:16:47] held it I said disciple then he just
[1:16:49] breathed on you and made to work life
[1:16:51] there's a new birth that's why he's
[1:16:54] still breathing
[1:16:56] he didn't stop breathing
[1:16:58] every time you receive a revelation from
[1:17:00] God's Word you are getting the breath of
[1:17:03] God breathing to you to quicken that
[1:17:05] word that you've took inhaled one day
[1:17:11] the headstone will unite with a body
[1:17:13] it'll be born by the breath of God but
[1:17:18] remember what the qualifications is to
[1:17:21] be Adam started the way he was the part
[1:17:26] of God that he was to be put into human
[1:17:28] flesh and made alive full-grown god of
[1:17:34] the earth brother Brennan said one day
[1:17:37] the sons of God will return
[1:17:39] I said bless in who is this mill charity
[1:17:41] he said they'll return again see because
[1:17:45] on the day of Pentecost the Holy Ghost
[1:17:47] came upon those that had been tutored
[1:17:49] for three and a half years and breathed
[1:17:52] upon them and said receive you the Holy
[1:17:54] Ghost he said what do you do promising
[1:17:57] that's just what he done with Adam when
[1:18:02] he breathed don't had him he said Adam
[1:18:04] you're an example he said I promise you
[1:18:07] Adam this fall ain't gonna be what
[1:18:11] everybody thinks I'm gonna bring it back
[1:18:17] the way you came and you and I right
[1:18:22] here on this earth receive the baptism
[1:18:25] of the Holy Ghost
[1:18:26] what as God breathes on us to quicken
[1:18:29] the word to make it alive now why
[1:18:31] wouldn't you want to hear the word why
[1:18:35] do you want to read something else but
[1:18:36] I'd read in the Bible
[1:18:41] brother Dale just goes over and over
[1:18:44] over no I'll just get so bored you let
[1:18:50] it be quick until you one time and you
[1:18:51] won't be bored the more you let God
[1:18:58] quicken that word to you one time you
[1:19:01] will never be the same I tell you that
[1:19:08] as an example because when I met God I
[1:19:11] wasn't ever the same until I found God
[1:19:16] two years in this message reading
[1:19:19] everything I could read studying
[1:19:20] everything listening to a tape to go
[1:19:22] into work one coming home and I've read
[1:19:25] six books from one day besides listening
[1:19:29] to two types
[1:19:35] now you just immunity you just read away
[1:19:39] cuz it praise God I'm that way cuz I
[1:19:44] like it
[1:19:45] cuz I can put my experience in the
[1:19:49] scriptures but you have most of people
[1:19:52] in this message to explain their it's
[1:19:54] their experience they'll explain it
[1:19:56] shouting speaking in tongue crying
[1:19:58] seeing visions seeing angels seeing this
[1:20:01] seeing that and when I come in this
[1:20:04] message I know I got the Holy Ghost
[1:20:08] because I come in this message as the
[1:20:14] message come in you yet maybe you
[1:20:18] accepted God but may I quote brother
[1:20:20] Branham as God accepted you never stop
[1:20:27] seeking God how many times I explained
[1:20:30] that to you come on brothers musician
[1:20:32] how many times I explained it over and
[1:20:34] over I had to rather face God at the end
[1:20:38] of the road and me saying God give me
[1:20:41] giving me everyday help me and lead me
[1:20:44] and get to the end of the road and him
[1:20:46] say get out of here I don't want to see
[1:20:47] you no more I'd rather do that than to
[1:20:49] not seek God and get to the end of the
[1:20:51] road and he says you didn't seek me I
[1:20:55] was there with you constantly I'm made
[1:20:57] in your services and I proclaimed sister
[1:21:03] Trudy called the other night
[1:21:05] you'd been six he just testified of it
[1:21:08] she called me and nanny was sitting in
[1:21:12] the room there and all at once I was
[1:21:17] struck and I said nanny let's pray we
[1:21:27] prayed for sister Trudy you asked her
[1:21:32] what happened she called the next day
[1:21:34] and said when she got off the phone
[1:21:36] immediately was changed when are we
[1:21:43] going to begin to believe God can do
[1:21:45] what we ask you to do do you understand
[1:21:51] why I'm getting in church born by the
[1:21:54] breath of God Adam was born by the
[1:21:55] breath of God the day of Pentecost they
[1:21:57] were born by the breath of God you and
[1:21:59] I've got to be born by the breath of God
[1:22:01] and when this thing is finished and the
[1:22:03] adoptions and everything that in takes
[1:22:05] place the headstone were you not with
[1:22:07] the body and God will again breathe the
[1:22:11] breath of eternal life into these bodies
[1:22:15] because that's what are you ain't gonna
[1:22:17] have to breathe no Holy Ghost into us
[1:22:19] because you'll have that when you'll
[1:22:22] breathe into your body and it'll be
[1:22:24] mighty time porn by the breath of God
[1:22:27] let's tan what do we got
