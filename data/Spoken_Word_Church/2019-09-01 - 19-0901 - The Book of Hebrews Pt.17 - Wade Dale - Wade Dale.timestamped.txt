[0:02] one less yet who did the last we need to
[0:05] laugh you didn't laugh yeah I'm gonna
[0:08] turn it
[0:18] Louise police would be doing it
[0:21] nothing I like it I don't meet brother
[0:25] Tim hems in two weeks or so not this
[0:28] coming weekend Burroughs Matthew Braille
[0:29] be here and then we're at also pranks
[0:32] right we're having our youth thing
[0:33] Saturday so I remember that we're
[0:35] getting it started special well look got
[0:41] star something about yeah well Joe you
[1:01] got directed to everybody brother you
[1:03] can't just you can't you involve can't
[1:05] be said there'll be no but you got to
[1:15] you got to Lane everybody's name Wayne
[1:19] hey OH
[1:23] you take Joyce
[1:24] [Music]
[1:26] that girl bro when we all will be ready
[1:29] all right let's go we got where Hebrews
[1:31] 11 and I want you to also remember like
[1:37] I said we'll be at Tim hems in two weeks
[1:39] remember us there but then also remember
[1:41] today we're starting on day of 70 weeks
[1:44] so we're gonna do a lengthy pan out
[1:47] where today we're just gonna be Bible
[1:49] we're just going to go do the Bible
[1:53] remember we've done it down here like
[1:55] two years ago again and we're going to
[1:58] look at it through a Jewish perspective
[2:00] because anytime you say Daniel 70 weeks
[2:03] what's the first thing you do
[2:04] well there's contention between three
[2:05] and a half and seventh is that three and
[2:07] a half years left or seven well that's
[2:09] not - that's not Daniel 10 - wait
[2:12] that man's idea right that's man
[2:15] interjecting so we're going to go into
[2:16] the Bible and let the Bible prove it but
[2:20] we're gonna have to take it from a
[2:22] Jewish perspective because Dan seven new
[2:23] weeks it's not to Gentiles it is only to
[2:27] the Jews
[2:28] we were interjected and I'll show you
[2:31] the chart later a long time from now but
[2:33] we were in projected because to get a
[2:35] Gentile bride if not that same would
[2:38] have been dry here together than when
[2:39] the middle church ages they wanted to be
[2:41] no menu that would have just been the
[2:44] Jewish all the way through and then they
[2:46] would it took the rapture - prophets
[2:48] would have come but no that's not the
[2:50] way though the Bible said the Gentiles
[2:52] will be in possession are grafted in the
[2:56] Gentiles will be grafted in for God to
[2:58] take a bride because we're going to look
[3:00] today where we'll see where
[3:03] Jehovah divorced Israel right and then
[3:07] in Jeremiah tells you that you if once
[3:11] your wife is polluted with another man
[3:13] you can't take her back so he couldn't
[3:15] take Israel back as a while again he
[3:18] took her back as serving far as remnant
[3:22] or ever now you want to call it but
[3:23] we're going to read in Jeremiah because
[3:24] remember Daniel starts off I know about
[3:28] books so what was the book he was
[3:31] reading he would read Jeremiah and it
[3:34] talks about the captivity and why they
[3:36] went into captivity see you got to
[3:38] understand that once you understand that
[3:39] then you'll understand the rest of
[3:41] Daniel seventy weeks it really doesn't
[3:43] have anything to do with three and a
[3:44] half and seven but to line it up it had
[3:48] everything to do with putting the
[3:50] scripture together so that the scripture
[3:52] can tell us what's going on right and I
[3:54] believe there is there is a big thick
[3:57] tension still and then maybe we will try
[4:02] to smooth it out a little bit but you
[4:06] gotta go by the Bible I'm gonna tell you
[4:10] this after a minute remember one thing
[4:13] just like brother George Quinn scripture
[4:15] cannot be broken scripture has to be
[4:19] fulfilled
[4:20] brother Brown didn't come to change the
[4:23] Bible he never changed one worse or
[4:27] whatever he says that you may think is
[4:31] different you're wrong right the Bible
[4:35] is not wrong the probably God according
[4:38] to what he preached is not wrong if it's
[4:40] wrong left then then truly we do need to
[4:42] find somebody else maybe there is
[4:43] somebody that has truth but no that's
[4:45] not that's not it
[4:46] we know we have Detra is not a lot of
[4:49] people have a tradition and it will show
[4:52] itself later on but you're going to have
[4:55] to bear with me because we're going to
[4:56] start back in Jeremiah today we're just
[4:58] going to read scriptures so you better
[5:00] to keep your Bible well read probably
[5:03] about thirty scriptures but that's how
[5:05] Daniel understood right he read by he
[5:08] understood by books what he read
[5:10] Jeremiah because Jeremiah was
[5:12] commissioned to write there was another
[5:15] boy I can't remember his name he wrote
[5:16] what Jeremiah said he was described and
[5:19] they rolled it up and put it in white
[5:22] yeah that's his name and he wrote it and
[5:24] put it in what bathroom and put it in a
[5:27] the vessel this man preached on it
[5:29] before the oh nothing he'll remember
[5:30] that and they put it in an earthen
[5:32] vessel then they found them in and
[5:36] around all right so just keep us in
[5:40] prayer if we need them you know it's
[5:42] getting cold in town where everything's
[5:44] kinda but there should be no contention
[5:45] in the message that maybe contention in
[5:48] the world the Lord this thing should be
[5:49] smoothy
[5:50] it should be where you have no question
[5:53] where if somebody questions you on
[5:54] anything you have an answer and it's not
[5:57] just your opinion
[5:58] right all right so we're gonna go
[6:00] through the Bible look to it in a Jewish
[6:03] paralyzed and then I think it would
[6:06] clear stuff up well it won't clear
[6:09] itself but we'll clear ourself up the
[6:12] Bible doesn't need clarity the title the
[6:16] Bible is clear that's like you know you
[6:19] like brother Brown said you just don't
[6:20] need a revelation to reach this baptized
[6:22] and they can you describe them just
[6:24] really don't think a revelation you just
[6:25] read in the book but there's a
[6:27] contention there though when Jesus you
[6:31] know how many people he told that to and
[6:32] they said well I'll take what Jesus said
[6:35] well he was saying the same thing to
[6:37] Peter oh you got two different gods
[6:39] which they do to agree so see what I
[6:42] mean we need to be established in what
[6:43] program did present-day tree present-day
[6:47] revelation not a no revelation present a
[6:49] revelation Luther's revelation was
[6:52] preached to him but it sold us you can
[6:55] get in the body of Christ was looted
[6:57] now you get a revelation with the jokes
[6:59] girl lived my faith but you add to that
[7:01] all right same way with this Hebrews 11
[7:06] I was hoping Wednesday night Louise was
[7:09] talking about the number 11 the number
[7:11] 11 Hebrews 11 the faith chapter of the
[7:15] Bible Hebrews 11 have you ever done that
[7:21] though it took like something just few
[7:23] people corner here take Hebrews 13:8 go
[7:27] read revelations 13 they go go through
[7:29] the Bible and read the thirteenth
[7:32] chapter in the eighth verse all through
[7:33] the Bible get almost all of it relates
[7:36] to Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[7:38] and forever
[7:40] same way with Hebrews 11 and different
[7:43] ones where the man who preached on the
[7:44] number 17 you take the number 17 and a
[7:46] number 50 if you want and all these
[7:50] different things happen brother Graham
[7:52] says the numerix of the Bible are
[7:53] correct I mean it's not some strange
[7:56] thing it's not something though like
[7:57] they you know you look at something I
[7:59] was researching something on YouTube and
[8:01] this guy I mean he he tastes like the
[8:04] fourth word and the third letter and
[8:07] puts the code together and got Barack
[8:10] Obama and got this and that the other it
[8:15] lasted about five minutes and I lasted
[8:17] about two minutes so that was a that was
[8:23] kind of fun to read but I'm not in that
[8:25] in depth to that you know I revelation
[8:27] is good but that's not revelation that
[8:29] just somebody think it word now you can
[8:33] make anything say what you want insane
[8:35] if you pick the numbers all right let's
[8:39] go Hebrew that isn't Hebrews 11 in
[8:42] heaven
[8:46] because it brings in food Sara the woman
[8:50] through faith also Sara herself received
[8:52] strength to conceive seed and was
[8:55] delivered of a child was delivered of a
[8:57] child when she was past age because she
[8:59] judged him faithful who they promised no
[9:02] we don't hear a lot about this in Sara
[9:04] in Genesis the account of Genesis you
[9:08] got Abraham Abraham laid with him
[9:09] you've got Sarah and attempt on the
[9:11] laughing in her heart
[9:14] am I gonna have pleasure will my husband
[9:16] again you know one more time or whatever
[9:18] and then God rebuked her but she has
[9:23] have a - this is the pride when I see
[9:27] women in the Bible you have to look at
[9:29] pride of what the bride is doing alright
[9:32] Sarah was Abraham's bride and we've been
[9:36] the Bride of Christ what we've got to
[9:38] receive strength we've got to take a
[9:40] body change to receive the seed Word of
[9:42] God
[9:42] you've already cooked that body change
[9:44] on the inside so you're receiving the
[9:46] Steep Word of God has a potential to
[9:49] your body change the makeover that go
[9:51] Sarah
[9:52] the same way now Sarah had we're all
[9:55] adults if she'd received seed all her
[9:57] life from Abraham little seed and there
[10:01] was no child pretty so she had to have a
[10:03] not just in the outside body chain she
[10:06] had to have her womb had to be redone
[10:08] same way with me and you you wound is
[10:12] gonna have to be redone so they've got
[10:15] you what so you can receive we perceive
[10:17] we've received as Christians we received
[10:19] seed all of our life if you came up
[10:21] badness methods gonna call for whatever
[10:23] whatever ever you've received seed word
[10:26] that may not be the right one it may be
[10:28] a little bit off you know badness
[10:30] Methodists need to eat word but now you
[10:33] you were seeing what Abraham even tried
[10:37] for a long time to produce what was
[10:40] going on right with natural seed but he
[10:43] can do it because God had never told him
[10:46] at first he said you go have a child
[10:48] Oh Sarah now when he comes to meet him
[10:50] and changes him to Abraham and Sarah not
[10:54] said riah Abraham knows then that he's
[10:58] going to produce that child with Sarah
[11:00] and I hate that the the quote keeps
[11:04] coming back to me who brother Graham
[11:05] said they've been Brides brides churches
[11:07] churches Brides churches he makes this
[11:09] big long quote he said what they'll come
[11:11] one
[11:12] Sarah was one she was the one that was
[11:16] gonna bring the promised son not Hagar
[11:21] not cateura now remember Abraham had
[11:24] three wives well I don't think our I
[11:27] guess you wouldn't consider her a wife
[11:29] she was a concubine but you had hagar
[11:32] sara and then when she died
[11:35] yanked the Torah which could mean all
[11:37] kind of types in the world but but you
[11:39] can think you got to take Sarah type of
[11:41] us because we that was the promise the
[11:43] Toro at the cross that was a natural
[11:45] group of people hey Garo Abraham have a
[11:50] little bit weird revelation and thought
[11:52] he could do it with Hagar to get the
[11:55] child he didn't get a child because
[11:56] remember Abraham said all of the dishes
[11:58] when they walk before you he thought God
[12:00] you should know I'm gonna have a son and
[12:03] there is well that's not the right one
[12:05] though the right one was Isaac and it
[12:09] had to come to Sarah
[12:10] that's why you have to boy you watch
[12:13] them through the Old Testament you go
[12:15] how in the world can God and do what he
[12:16] did through no I'm not through faith
[12:21] Rahab ran with the harlot you the whole
[12:26] that's preaching on this last Sunday
[12:30] doesn't choose the prostitute she had a
[12:33] most every man in that in that City of
[12:36] Newark but when all of her accusers died
[12:40] when she had no more accuser
[12:42] I wanted this the rent is rarely general
[12:45] matarese her which she shouldn't have
[12:47] done but Christ had to marry a Gentile
[12:50] bride
[12:51] he went boasted he spoke to many Israel
[12:55] but to bring us in he married this woman
[12:58] that him she was no version by no me but
[13:02] now remember here come Jesse here come
[13:04] over here come David right out of that
[13:07] natural lineage that you would think
[13:09] would be not very pure and in same way
[13:11] he'd go to daily you go to David David
[13:14] could have had any heat probably in his
[13:16] life had thousands of burdens and I mean
[13:18] thousands because you think popular of
[13:20] the kids thousands of the virgin but he
[13:24] wanted that one girl but if I brother
[13:26] brown said you can say what you won't do
[13:28] about it
[13:28] Solomon was gonna come through that
[13:30] woman not all these other ones so so
[13:35] that's the way you look at us you look
[13:37] it up Gentiles it isn't still things for
[13:40] dogs till things were unclean we do
[13:42] unclean things according to the Jewish
[13:45] tradition of the earth or the chill
[13:47] where the children of God they keep
[13:49] saying that where the children done
[13:50] Messiah is coming to us well they missed
[13:54] part we came to us but if they would
[13:57] look you see how blinded they are if
[14:01] they looked in the Old Testament see the
[14:02] tops you've got a Gentile Brides
[14:04] interjected all through the Old
[14:06] Testament and they can't see that but
[14:09] they know the Gentiles are going to come
[14:10] in for what it is they flip-flopped and
[14:12] said we're going to save one of them
[14:13] side come we're going to introduce him
[14:15] you well it's just going to be reverse
[14:17] of that but because they rejected him
[14:20] when we read in jeremiah today where he
[14:22] said I had to put you away and give you
[14:24] a writing of divorcement because you
[14:26] went after other gods so through faith
[14:30] also Sara herself received strength to
[14:31] conceive seed and was delivered of a
[14:33] child when she was past age because she
[14:35] judged him faithful to the promise so
[14:37] she had to believe also okay because
[14:40] when she woke up that morning she had to
[14:44] go through a process to change her body
[14:46] she had to believe something she didn't
[14:49] sweat just laying there going no
[14:52] something clicked inside of her during
[14:56] that time that male candidate was
[14:57] talking to Abraham and it is true that
[15:01] member Tim you were talking about this
[15:02] and I'm gonna preach a little bit on it
[15:04] when we get up there he said actually
[15:06] asked me about it cuz everybody's
[15:08] putting everything on the man all
[15:12] Abraham was this great guy ain't Adam
[15:14] was this great guy these all these great
[15:17] guys the Bible says and out of all that
[15:20] what wait just like a preach that couple
[15:23] Sundays ago or whenever was same way
[15:25] with Sarah
[15:26] there's no way Sarah didn't just all I
[15:28] just believed Abraham no you got have
[15:30] revelation for you son do you got any on
[15:32] Revelation okay so the bride of Jesus
[15:36] Christ it's gotta have a revelation now
[15:40] we know who our husband is and then we
[15:42] know that the child is going to come to
[15:43] us but work on what we're doing we're
[15:45] producing Jesus Christ
[15:47] remember Boaz and Ruth had a baby and
[15:53] they gave it to Naomi which is Israel
[15:56] the old Israel don't array her gave it
[16:00] to remember in the Bible is a hand and
[16:01] who well that's what we're doing we're
[16:02] going to produce the bride and Christ is
[16:05] going to produce
[16:05] Jesus not a baby though we're gonna
[16:07] produce a repro grown man but we're
[16:09] going to introduce that full-grown
[16:10] person the Jews
[16:14] [Applause]
[16:17] her body was on fire because here one
[16:20] must have been dead when she was six
[16:21] down here oh no no no I mean it's it's
[16:25] not something she eats up she believed
[16:26] she had like said she'd been having
[16:29] relation with Abraham since they were 16
[16:31] years old produced nothing so either he
[16:34] was we know for a fact he wasn't there
[16:37] was anything wrong with his personnel
[16:39] personal try not to be something graphic
[16:43] you know they went wrong with he can
[16:44] produce a child because of Hagar they
[16:46] had a baby and then when Sarah died hey
[16:49] Brandon what seven more kids with the
[16:52] Torah so it was an Abraham see look it's
[16:55] not Dutch problem God's not the problem
[16:58] he's got the original sheet work it was
[17:02] the bride then had a problem so she had
[17:05] to be changed and when you're born again
[17:07] it changes the wound with your line
[17:09] right man so you can receive what the
[17:12] right seed word put it in the right
[17:14] place and it produced the right product
[17:16] okay so when I said that I meant you had
[17:20] to go Jeff D throughout food or anything
[17:21] like that she just had to believe not
[17:23] only not only did she just when when
[17:27] when Abraham let me get to my point when
[17:29] Abraham met Melchizedek Sarah was there
[17:32] heard the whole conversation I don't
[17:35] believe she was out in the pasture right
[17:37] remember she was in the tent they were
[17:39] sitting in front of the tent she must
[17:41] have been right up against the ten kind
[17:42] of things I like the world's going on
[17:44] and when that man spoke and said because
[17:47] he did Abraham don't have a time alive
[17:49] you know what I mean she dumped him out
[17:51] of 28-day cycle so heat but he told
[17:53] Abraham he said in that 28-day cycle no
[17:57] worse this time cycle of life you have a
[18:00] child so it's Tara knew that she would
[18:02] she had to be changed back as I'm sure
[18:04] she was not having periods at ninety
[18:05] years old so see she had to get a
[18:09] revelation and go this is it you see the
[18:13] bride's the same way the bride's got to
[18:15] have a revelation
[18:16] got to hear from what dot in human flesh
[18:21] and then and then believe for herself
[18:24] that she got she one perceived what
[18:27] strength now wasn't it
[18:29] Saturday and put on her jogging you know
[18:31] jogging dress and go jogging and no it
[18:35] was her faith she said okay finally
[18:39] remember she was there when she was the
[18:42] one that said let's try the tango
[18:44] come on oh I can't produce we've been
[18:47] having relations from you know 40 50 60
[18:49] years and nothing's happened but Hagar
[18:52] here you take her remember she gave
[18:54] Hagar to Abraham great room and then she
[18:57] got mad he got mad why because she could
[19:03] conceive how many time to be read in
[19:04] history where that's happened
[19:07] even with Solomon's time where the one
[19:09] produced the child but the other one
[19:10] stole it it's happened to me even even
[19:13] in modern times the woman can't have a
[19:15] child but she winds up stealing one from
[19:17] the hospital or something so a woman
[19:19] gets kind of jealous if she can't
[19:21] produce basically when you got a Abram
[19:24] standing there going you know I chosen
[19:27] of God God's talking to this man you
[19:29] know and leading them through this
[19:32] journey but she comes to a place here
[19:34] though where it narrows down that's what
[19:35] we're doing now we're narrowing down
[19:36] there's only one bride there's not
[19:38] there's not a bride out there there's a
[19:41] bride and that's the bride of Jesus
[19:42] Christ under the message to the out
[19:44] under Malachi 4 message under the
[19:48] Malachi 4 new birth according to Malachi
[19:51] 40 new birth according to Melancon 4 is
[19:54] this message what might allow on your
[19:56] heart
[20:00] yeah sure what takes the nervousness
[20:03] away it takes all these Tibetan but you
[20:05] you you know you're born to be a mother
[20:06] and thank God we still got them don't
[20:11] hear the other day that the population
[20:13] of the world is going down because of
[20:14] two things one is famine and nothing was
[20:17] what homosexuality there's so much
[20:21] rampant homosexuality till there's no
[20:23] there we gap of the generations because
[20:33] kind of go home you're right they won't
[20:35] be none left they don't judge him
[20:38] faithful to that promise
[20:39] alright so she believed that's a woman
[20:41] believing God you and I are all women in
[20:44] the body of Christ so we are the same as
[20:47] Sarah
[20:48] see that's the big thing one though Tim
[20:50] and I were talking about you know
[20:51] especially in the message we separate
[20:54] this thing you know you're dog meat
[20:55] because brother Brown said you love me
[20:57] he didn't say you have done me he said
[21:01] their dog me and bro friend was a well I
[21:04] was listening to him the other day and
[21:06] man he said you know he said the only
[21:08] woman that put on makeup maybe was
[21:09] talking to what were you hearing him I
[21:12] think what word was I'm listening he
[21:14] said you know think she got eat my dog
[21:16] now if you see a woman with makeup
[21:18] whom you just walk up to her and say oh
[21:42] you don't see them thank God that was
[21:45] way back when you never told me I would
[21:48] say last week I was talking to my friend
[21:52] but you gotta remember listen brother
[21:55] branham probably regretted saying that
[21:58] in his humanity but remember that he
[22:01] will have the spirit of Elijah and that
[22:04] spirit of Elijah cording to want to
[22:06] preach to you a while back about the the
[22:08] lives of ministry was to two women he
[22:12] knew how to handle two women he like a
[22:14] lot said John the Baptist brother Brown
[22:16] and the two witnesses they're gonna deal
[22:18] with two or what two different churches
[22:20] and that's exactly what brother Brown
[22:23] had to do with he was dealing with the
[22:24] bolts and the tree he was trying to get
[22:26] the boss to see the tree mm-hmm
[22:29] jump dear someday but to say that that
[22:33] was the Elijah spirit because look at
[22:37] look at Elijah and Elijah all the things
[22:39] that they called down on people why did
[22:42] it Elijah go run back in the cabin and
[22:44] hide itself I'm getting the Bell when he
[22:47] condemned her really he condemned her
[22:50] but we remember brother Brown said when
[22:51] that I'm not and lifted off of him he
[22:53] goes back into cave you know
[22:55] Jezebel said I'll cut your head off
[22:57] another word well that's the same way we
[23:03] aren't but the anointing you can say
[23:04] some things even brother Dale says
[23:07] something though the cloth said one time
[23:08] he said man I just heard everybody's
[23:09] head roll and before me brother Dale
[23:12] said something it just you know kind of
[23:14] a tent off these and I heard something
[23:15] hit the floor and roll he said it must
[23:17] have been people hey it but you just
[23:18] have to say things like that because
[23:20] we're listening were sheep why does the
[23:23] sheep Shepherd have a shepherd's hook
[23:25] why didn't he just do this no he's got a
[23:28] staff and that hook is to reach and grab
[23:31] them around the neck and pull them out
[23:33] on the street or wherever they're at and
[23:36] take the other end and whack them in the
[23:38] head with it
[23:39] so we're sheep we have to be laying all
[23:41] over them and therefore sprang there
[23:44] even of one and him as good as dead from
[23:48] a hurry for him
[23:50] see Road children Abraham Abram and
[23:54] Sarah Sarah I had zero children but I
[23:58] promised them told Abraham said look
[24:01] down can you count the grains of sand
[24:03] look up can you count start said your
[24:05] people what is that big listen when he
[24:09] sat down as many as the stars of the sky
[24:10] in multitude and as the sand which is by
[24:13] the seashore innumerable right these all
[24:18] died in faith not having received the
[24:20] promises now what is the promise is that
[24:23] this is where we get into another
[24:25] contention of people believe in the
[24:27] people in the Old Testament has a new
[24:29] birth there's no one promise and the
[24:32] promise of the Holy Ghost can be in your
[24:34] soul acts 2:38
[24:36] the Pentagon I've named you Jesus Christ
[24:39] for the making you Cynthia showers you
[24:40] can get the gift of the Holy Ghost for
[24:43] the walk the promise is to you all right
[24:46] so they didn't receive the promises they
[24:48] were under an anointing in the Old
[24:50] Testament not a new birth for David
[24:53] would have done when he did he was a
[24:54] murderer and an adulterer Darnay wipe
[24:59] that out
[25:00] same way with even great everyone have
[25:03] quality even Solomon did one of the
[25:04] greatest man that ever would both wise
[25:06] man in the world at the end of his life
[25:08] he led two women turning into idolatry
[25:11] so because they didn't have a new birth
[25:14] when God's anointing lifted off of them
[25:17] they were just Moses killed an Egyptian
[25:18] he did a lot of things wrong according
[25:22] does but when God looks a boy on my
[25:27] justification these all died in faith
[25:30] not having received the promises but
[25:33] having seen them afar off never brother
[25:37] Brown said every prophet
[25:38] desire to see this day this day you're
[25:41] living in right now even all the Old
[25:43] Testament prophesied of this day
[25:45] Jeremiah specially seen many times he
[25:47] talks about the latter day and I think I
[25:50] got one for
[25:52] we'll read he talks about in the latter
[25:54] day you'll understand these things so
[25:56] they were all looking toward and in but
[26:00] having seen them afar off and were
[26:02] persuaded of them what knowing that we
[26:04] would come knowing that we would fulfill
[26:06] these promises and embrace them and
[26:09] confessed that they were strangers and
[26:10] pilgrims on the earth
[26:12] what a great thing they died under the
[26:16] blood of bulls and goats but knowing
[26:17] that somebody is going to grab this
[26:20] thing and resurrect them out of the
[26:23] ground right but they are they that say
[26:26] such things declare plainly that they
[26:28] seek a country all right no no not a
[26:32] integral business you understand United
[26:35] States now there's one thing for sure
[26:38] we'll try to get into a little bit today
[26:40] maybe maybe part two of this foundation
[26:45] you got to remember two things about
[26:47] that seventy weeks never forget this it
[26:51] says to thy people and thy holy city
[26:54] two things not just two people God's
[26:58] promised them like brother Brown said
[27:00] right there where Abraham took communion
[27:02] with Melchizedek is where the new thing
[27:04] I don't know about the new city not the
[27:06] millennium that's temporary the new city
[27:10] is right I was right up under their feet
[27:11] and it's gonna push up and the bride's
[27:14] gonna sit down on it on the future in
[27:16] the future so there is the land part
[27:19] that God thanks so much of that place
[27:22] we're going back to it all of us are
[27:23] we're all going to Jerusalem do you
[27:27] ain't end up all right so remember 970
[27:31] weeks you got to cover the people and
[27:33] the city so there's got to be a people
[27:35] restored and a city restored or physical
[27:38] theory
[27:39] if they say that such things declare
[27:42] plainly that they seek the country and
[27:43] truly if they had been mindful of that
[27:46] country from which they came out they
[27:49] might have had opportunity to that
[27:51] turn now you gotta remember it's not
[27:53] just the physical place from them me and
[27:56] you we got to remember where we come
[27:58] from where we take this land because
[28:02] when c21 a new birth comes the true new
[28:05] birth wipes out your old birth now done
[28:10] well we went through it oh you sisters
[28:12] are going to do what no you had the baby
[28:15] but once you had that baby and once you
[28:17] got reborn or rebirth you that's not
[28:19] your kid anymore your God stop right
[28:23] because they've been mindful attention
[28:25] from whence they came out they might
[28:28] have that opportunity to return but now
[28:30] they desire a better country that isn't
[28:33] heavenly so it's not a not unearthly
[28:35] part in songs or heavenly wherefore God
[28:38] is not ashamed to be called their God
[28:39] for he has prepared for them a city
[28:44] where in the Millennium which will be to
[28:47] the Jews there will be a city there
[28:51] because remember the walls had to be
[28:54] even rebuild gird Ezrin kneel by the
[28:56] physical city was rebuilt then it was
[28:58] poured out again by in eighty seventy by
[29:02] titus and they were dispersed again see
[29:04] there's several dispersions of israel
[29:06] not just one we're going to talk about
[29:07] one today we're going to disperse them
[29:09] to let the land rest well he did in AD
[29:12] 70 he promised even Daniel 9:25
[29:16] he said the French will come in other
[29:18] words desolation and he'll just tear the
[29:20] place apart
[29:21] alright so we're gonna look at that and
[29:23] see that what but see what's God doing
[29:26] even your brother Brown see God's
[29:28] bringing them back to Israel right under
[29:31] Eichmann and Hitler those two hundred
[29:33] thousand thousand demons were reigning
[29:35] them back to the Israel why because he's
[29:39] not going to deal with them he promised
[29:40] him he'd deal with them in their
[29:41] homeland only not
[29:43] or else he's not doing with Israel in
[29:45] the nation in America no he's going to
[29:48] deal with them when they all get back to
[29:50] what a physical city but remember I
[29:54] still going to be even our future home
[29:56] as a physical city it's not some fairy
[29:58] tale and as ego 42 44 is the Millennial
[30:03] temple was going to be built a true
[30:04] temple because you got to restore the
[30:08] people and the city right but now they
[30:13] desire a better country that isn't
[30:14] heavenly where our God is not ashamed to
[30:16] be called their done for he has prepared
[30:19] for them a city then we go to Abraham by
[30:22] faith Abraham when he was tried now this
[30:27] is after the promise he got of the Sun
[30:28] he got the Sun here then God said go
[30:32] take him out and kill him
[30:35] now remember I even had a lot of wisdom
[30:37] he didn't tell Sara any 11 he was very
[30:43] wise by not telling Sarah that by faith
[30:47] Abraham Lee was trying to offered up
[30:49] Isaac and he that received the promises
[30:51] offered up his only begotten Son then
[30:55] went with Christ gave His only begotten
[30:57] Son of whom it was said that in Isaac
[31:00] shall thy seed be called
[31:02] see paper hell didn't have a quote book
[31:05] or a Bible to read he had to believe
[31:07] what God told him at first and he stood
[31:10] on that and said hey if he give me this
[31:13] child he changed my body he changed my
[31:15] life buddy he changed her womb and he
[31:19] gave me this child killing her not he's
[31:22] got a raised something he's not bring
[31:24] something back to fulfill fulfilled the
[31:26] promise all right something Abraham just
[31:28] walks up there and he grabs a knife and
[31:30] he said okay good
[31:32] but remember what happened he's a
[31:34] mistake of whom it was said that in
[31:37] Isaac shall thy seed be called
[31:38] accounting that God was able to raise
[31:40] him up I think understood now even from
[31:43] the dead from whence also he received
[31:46] his
[31:47] in a figure by fate's
[31:50] Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning
[31:52] the things to come by faith Jacob when
[31:56] he was dying blessed both the sons of
[31:58] Joseph did their bringing a lineage down
[31:59] both the sons of Joseph in worship they
[32:02] didn't want the top of his saddle now
[32:05] who was the both of the sons of Joseph
[32:10] there from the Monessen right excuse me
[32:15] now it's the two sons of Joseph excuse
[32:19] me and worship leaning upon the top of
[32:20] the staff by faith Joseph when he died
[32:23] made mention of the departing of the
[32:25] children of Israel that hurricane not
[32:31] gonna hit Florida you know we got some
[32:35] money we got some new guys well the new
[32:39] Hunt Club that we're in a lot of them
[32:41] live in Central Florida
[32:43] they're all lineman's they works with Lu
[32:45] houer company and they were they call
[32:48] they call the Senate tax and there's
[32:51] even guys they're not Christians at all
[32:53] by domain but they were just telling the
[32:55] team Anna that maybe a month before they
[32:57] can start hunting because they I think
[33:00] time to cross Florida at a category-5
[33:02] the way they thought it was it was going
[33:03] to go right
[33:04] Florida and it would just they'd be
[33:06] working from Christmas so what we done
[33:10] was is I just didn't look I'm gonna pray
[33:12] the job will be safe
[33:14] and you'll have you know how to not have
[33:17] that many problem what I didn't realize
[33:19] then it just I was working yesterday but
[33:21] no day for yesterday I driving down the
[33:24] road and the thought comes to me
[33:25] there's believers down there on the East
[33:30] Coast we're going to ganged up and I
[33:32] just started calling brother jacked up
[33:33] brother let's go brother smiley and deep
[33:38] brown and then that church in
[33:39] Jacksonville that y'all are going to to
[33:41] preach out that's all on the East Coast
[33:43] I said god I forgot I'm sorry I forgot
[33:45] about your children I said just turn
[33:48] that thing and I said turn it side you
[33:52] know and I want to be honest with you I
[33:54] said turning south because that's Key
[33:56] West and down that way I really I mean
[34:02] you know you just you said I said that
[34:04] typically think about the last word
[34:06] nothing well no or how it just you know
[34:07] direct that thing away I didn't even
[34:10] think he was gonna turn it right turn
[34:12] Clyde and take it right up the coast and
[34:13] they ain't I mean that thing went like
[34:15] this and it's both flew across Florida
[34:16] this thing now it's turning and going
[34:18] straight up 175 my line when you made me
[34:21] to bet his coat the Florida a lot of
[34:24] people would die being way sometimes it
[34:26] did die he knows what we need we may say
[34:29] things immense every once in a while but
[34:30] he knows I didn't even think about
[34:32] turning them out into the Atlantic Ocean
[34:34] then just let it fill the way out so
[34:37] [Music]
[34:46] he's in Florida see they didn't know
[34:49] about that something so God's a good gun
[34:51] he's going to turn that thing in if they
[34:53] hit some it's just going to be a little
[34:54] bit of water and ten and everything will
[34:56] be okay yeah oh my goodness
[35:00] lady they need to just they're on the
[35:03] other side of them if they from Fort st.
[35:05] Joe on the other side but you know what
[35:10] I was thinking you know what the devil's
[35:12] a song you can't stop that hurricane
[35:13] nobody nobody nobody can stop a
[35:16] hurricane
[35:17] I said heavenly they I thought saying he
[35:23] created you he created the ground we
[35:26] walk on and that God all he has to do is
[35:28] say peace be still and you know one day
[35:30] category five hurricane would just be
[35:35] really pretty clouds and it would be
[35:37] distributing just speaking water so you
[35:40] speak the word sometimes I can't think
[35:42] about humanity but think about the
[35:44] believers think about the believers that
[35:46] were in that ma'am go jacked up it was
[35:48] gonna hip West Palm Beach and I mean
[35:49] that would be a direct hit here up there
[35:51] with Long Beach do anyway just think
[35:55] about that God's mindful always thing
[35:57] that we asked for but you know what
[35:59] sometimes you get desperate though when
[36:01] you start asking you think God please
[36:03] not though believers right there on the
[36:05] cover
[36:06] you know much less the ones that are
[36:08] handling you know romantic statement and
[36:10] I'll live there on the other side I
[36:11] would just talk about the ones coming in
[36:13] from this side if everything hit was 175
[36:16] mile an hour winds they said environment
[36:17] is just gonna wipe it off so if he's got
[36:21] believers in the Bahamas Lord we pray
[36:22] that you will turn that thing again and
[36:24] give it away ice only God week there's
[36:29] only one God to serve they can take that
[36:31] away all these other guys are totally
[36:36] inferior
[36:37] we have accounting that God was able to
[36:40] raise him up well let's go down here by
[36:43] faith Joseph when he died made mention
[36:44] of the departing of the children of
[36:46] Ephraim gave commandment concerning his
[36:47] bones the Joad of dead one what did
[36:49] Joseph or Joseph was a perfect type of
[36:52] Christ he wanted his bones carried to
[36:56] Jerusalem he might have died in Egypt
[37:01] but he wanted to be buried in Jerusalem
[37:03] comes like brother Brown said several
[37:05] times he said Joseph knew where the
[37:08] Christ was coming he knew the
[37:10] resurrection was going to come in
[37:11] through something he wanted to be later
[37:13] where he could be resurrected not out
[37:14] there somewhere else
[37:15] all right that's really good so let's
[37:18] get right here but my faith Moses when
[37:20] he was born was hid three months of his
[37:23] parents because they saw he was a proper
[37:24] child in other words he wouldn't know
[37:26] better than that rest but there was a
[37:27] promise between Joc abandoned homes dr.
[37:35] Banton that was two up anyway
[37:39] they were not afraid of the Kings
[37:41] commandment but though I came to him and
[37:44] told him they were going to have town
[37:46] three months of his parents because they
[37:49] saw that the proper child and they were
[37:50] not afraid of the Kings commandment what
[37:52] was the king's commandment kill all the
[37:55] babies under two years old right by
[37:57] faith Moses when he was come to years
[38:00] refused to be called the son of
[38:02] Pharaoh's daughter the same way with you
[38:06] and I you you refused to become what
[38:08] Pharaoh was Egypt that's the world so we
[38:10] are not anymore by the new birth we are
[38:14] not anymore children of Egypt are
[38:16] children of Pharaoh Pharaoh being the
[38:19] devil
[38:20] any more be born again choosing rather
[38:23] to suffer affliction with the people of
[38:25] God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin
[38:28] for a season that's what we come out of
[38:30] and listen you need to be careful that
[38:33] that last part in that spirit part don't
[38:36] lean you back toward and it will they
[38:40] don't you pray for me that will lead you
[38:45] back to the world every day but remember
[38:50] you had better suffer affliction with
[38:53] the people of God than to enjoy the
[38:55] pleasures of sin for season why would
[38:58] you want to be complicated with
[38:59] believers if there's not something
[39:01] inside of you that knows that if you're
[39:03] in a crowd of grumps and Clare serves
[39:06] and whoremongers and you want to be
[39:08] there with them sometimes we have to
[39:10] walk through but if you want to go be
[39:14] with that group you need a new birth if
[39:17] you're not if you're not comfortable if
[39:22] you're not comfortable with the people
[39:23] of God you got a problem you're not born
[39:26] again just remember I'm real comfortable
[39:29] with my family my other family members
[39:31] that's right
[39:31] okay I don't get nervous when I preach
[39:33] the reason I don't get nervous cuz I'm
[39:34] freaking to my family members okay so it
[39:38] just it helps me to know that that I've
[39:41] talked into my family yeah I'm not
[39:43] talking to strangers oh we might not
[39:44] know each other personally from humanity
[39:47] but in our in our inside I will talk
[39:50] about this this past weekend but inside
[39:54] of you there's a kindred spirit the
[39:55] Bible talks about a kindred spirit now I
[39:57] mean Bob may not have a kindred spirit
[39:58] though he don't like the mutton I do so
[40:00] man him can't sit there and calm about
[40:02] deer hunting but when I say God stands
[40:08] he he we all perk up because see that
[40:11] that's something that wasn't the inside
[40:12] mammals we talked about I kind of so
[40:18] much said one time said what he's saying
[40:20] is something you don't like
[40:25] if you don't like the hunt pillow
[40:28] Saturday go and all of that but in mama
[40:33] deer hunter are you people in doha y'all
[40:35] standing y'all doing something wrong
[40:37] let's see what i'm and so saying is
[40:39] something you don't like you don't like
[40:42] that's why that's why we need to be
[40:47] careful and y'all shoulda listened to
[40:48] what Louie said and what brother George
[40:51] plan and then we're talking about
[40:53] criticizing so many people you know why
[40:55] you criticize them cuz there's something
[40:57] you don't like you don't mean it's wrong
[41:00] you know that is correct and we talked
[41:08] about that this weekend - we have a
[41:09] situation where we kind of all got
[41:11] together Sunday after church between the
[41:13] two churches that are up there
[41:14] Kentuckian and God are talking about and
[41:18] one girl spoke up and said well I I'm
[41:21] just going to tell it like we should
[41:22] stay at Google said then she said I
[41:24] can't bring my friends to church because
[41:26] every time I bring them to church she's
[41:28] a schoolteacher and they have short hair
[41:30] and their rings and probably put on some
[41:33] makeup Brenda her friend does yeah no
