we love you and we thank you in Jesus name yes amen okay Ephesians 1 everybody already to know that scripture makees 17 times I think we'll be reading it but that's all right we haven't exhausted it yet blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved all right let's go to Second Peter 3 and these are the scriptures that brother Bram if you remember on the message of the future home was using all right second Peter the third chapter this Second Epistle beloved I now write unto you in both which I stir up your pure Minds by way of remembrance that you may may be mindful of The Words which were spoken before by the holy prophets and the of The Commandments of us the Apostles of the Lord and Savior knowing this that there shall come in the last days scoffers walking after their own lust and saying where is the promise of his coming for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were were before were from the foundation of the creation for this they willingly are ignorant of that by the word of God now listen here's where the scriptures are probably was picking up now for this by for this they willingly are ignorant of that by the word of God the heavens were of old and the Earth standing out of the water and in the water whereby the world that then was being overflowed with water perished but the heavens and the Earth which are now by the same word are kept in store reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and predition of ungodly men but beloved be not ignorant of this one thing that one day is that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years and a thousand years is one day the Lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness but is longsuffering to us not willing that any should should perish but that all should come to repentance but the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night into which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise and the elements shall melt with fervent heat the Earth also and the works that are th end shall be burned seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved what manner of person ought we to be in all holy conversation and godliness looking for and hastening to the coming of the day of God where in the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved and the element shall melt with fervent heat nevertheless we according to his promise look for new heavens and a new Earth wherein dwelleth righteousness all right let's go over to Revelations now 21 verse one and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first heaven and the first Earth First Earth were passed away there was no more sea and I John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride Adorn for her husband and I heard a great voice out of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are past away you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word I got a lot of quotes and uh I almost printed the entire book of the future home for you but you know I just pray that you will go read the the book amen and be able to get a whole lot lot more than what I could dare to try to say or impart unto you but now I hope you understood what I was trying to bring this morning of the uh the message of showing that you know that first one I want a Divine Healing campaign all right and then a message followed that he in campaign and the prophet would not let somebody else preach it for him he preached his own message because they wouldn't be bringing it the way that he wanted it brought right so he you know they he he brought his own message because it was the restoration of the word or the faith Revelation faith of the fathers that had to be brought back to the church all right and in that then there would be a healing campaign go out to catch the attention of the people and they could receive the word then you know that would be uh spoken unto them and and it would bring them to a reality of how that God is living among us because that's the purpose of of the uh the healing campaign was to show that and anybody just picking up on these please go back and get the other messages because I can't try to cover everything in one that's right all right and we know that the prophet as we said this morning he continually said you know no Divine Healing no Resurrection that's no Divine Healing No Redemption of the body all right but there was a Divine Healing campaign went out see with a great signs and wonders to get the attention of the people right and then they they would turn away from you know the things and it was exactly like in the ministry of the Lord Jesus when he first began that everybody wanted the you know the young Prophet to come and speak unto them but when he begin to say I and my father are one see then they begin to pull away from him all right and as they did then see uh it showed what they were all right so in the last days God didn't just send a message out that's cuz as I said and emphasized over and over look how hard it would be for brother Brandon to actually have to preach to people about the uh you know the healing of the body and and trying to get them to see it and then to to try to express to them that they wern't going to get a new body because everybody believed they were right you know all right and and like I said then not even in their carnality looked like they would have looked up the word Resurrection yeah because everybody saids oh we believe in the resurrection yeah yes we believe in the resurrection to come but Resurrection does not mean replacement see what what our thoughts of Resurrection was is just raise up you know raise up well you know why if God's going to give a new body all right right now are you listening if God is going to give you a new body right why would it be dealing with Resurrection that's right am is it going to raise up a new body why don't you just speak it see you wouldn't have to use the word Resurrection see and in that way see we we we in our own Super religious way of thinking and listening to Mankind we wound up by denying what the word of God was actually saying and even the words that we were saying ourselves amen and and I said we talk about resurrection and I brought that out from John there of where Mary see our M excuse me she uh oh yes Lazarus will raise in the last days see job in the last days out there see because mankind wanted to believe in the resurrection well but see Jesus then said I am the resurrection see all right now we haven't got to that one yet we haven't got to that point of what he's saying but I wanted you to understand and read that scripture in John because he said he that not only I am the resurrection he one only said he that believeth in me right shall not die right all right he was speaking all the way to a total Redemption that's right right right there in the scriptures see that man shall not die all right see then you know going on to that somebody's going to be alive and be changed as Paul calls it the moment the twinkle of an eye and see the Lord Jesus spoke of it all right and then bringing it out we were talking about how that he had a great ministry in his early years and then you know seemingly when the opening of the of the uh the seals of Matthew 24 to the Lord Jesus then where's he headed to Calvary that's right not a lot said not a lot done he was heading to Calvary but the greatest of all things through the opening of those seeds in Matthew 24 that he preached them you know then you see brother Bram and he starts off in a healing campaign and and and a a Ministry following the faith of the fathers and but then he comes to a place that it seems to be just going downward and see then when he does then he comes forth to bring his message amen cuz his message was not a restoration of the faith of the fathers that had to be brought right but he was to bring us the complete plan of Redemption all right now the complete Plan of Redemption see would have to deal with not only the soul of mankind but it would have to deal with the body all right so then we could you know maybe some people begin to listen to brother brandom as he began to talk about you know the Redemption of the body but still they wasn't picking up on it and one day he preached a message called the future home of the Heavenly bridegroom and Earthly bride all right and as he preached that we just term it future home but really it's Heavenly bridegroom and Earthly bride I think what stated all right now when he be to bring that see he went into talking about the Redemption of this world well that really would be a shock to mankind you know religious people couldn't follow that tone because oh as we just read here in Peter and we just read in Revelation that this world and all that we see is going to be just it's going to be we read it it's going to be annihilated everything is going to be Anni well where are we going where are we going to live what are we going to do if you're going to annihilate this world do you realize if you annihilate this world you would interrupt the whole solar system that's right right and what would happen to the entire solar system see and and all like that but we we see we didn't think of those things all right but then he he was bringing it out so we could understand the complete Plan of Redemption see that was his message then was to bring us the complete Plan of Redemption and we read about six or eight quotes there where the Prophet was saying like the Rapture and the different ones where he was saying that not in the years of preparation not in the healing campaign right his message started through the opening of the seals that was for him to bring the other had already been brought the faith of the fathers had already been brought by the apostles right he didn't have to come and bring us the Bible right see but he had to come and pick up where the where the apostles left off that's right that would have to be continued on and the apostles never spoke of the son of man now they wrote Matthew Mark Luke and John yes cuz that's the writing of the Lord Jesus and of what he say it but where did Paul even mention the son of man right it wasn't there he didn't even talk about it right none of those understood here comes a prophet then during his time of restoring the faith he starts talking about son of man Resurrection sign see and God was there performing The Resurrection sign in the prophet's Ministry not the prophet now the man was a man is like you and I right but God begin to use him to bring those things and to show what you and I would have to have in the last days all right we've been over that but see then coming to that position then he would bring his message right brother this message was a message of eternal life I even asked you to do one thing we have some books downstairs if you don't have one I know I've got a couple anyway of the uh the titles of all the sermons most of you probably have that you know the little book it'll show you the titles of all the sermons I would ask you to go after the seals open in 63 to the prophet and just read the titles right just read the titles of the sermon right the old in the old days it was what demonology uh you know some kind of a something dealing in life but after the seals broke look what it was future home Christ the Myster of God revealed things that are to be who is this MDC Mighty God unveiled read them just just read the titles of the sermons and you'll see that it it it's bringing forth eternal life right see cuz that was his message was to bring us the message of eternal life that's what caught me when I when I heard the the prophet talking it it caught me to see that hey you you know we was like this we was oh yes bless God one of these days one of these days we're going up to heaven we don't know what we're going to do we may sit on the clouds and I'll be tickled to play hard you know oh we could really make great emphasis you know and we could really make people just feel good you know I'll be glad to do whatever God wants me to do but here comes a prophet talking about us living here right right amen and bringing out the Bible about us living here y that's hard to understand you think it was hard for him to preach in his early Ministries I said this morning am to try to show people what a resurrection is and Divine Healing what the proof of it how much more would it be to coming after the opening of the seals cuz if you followed me and what the reading we read this morning those quotes were all after the seals broke right and all of them just about it even even mentions the seals in it of not in the years of preparation but when the seals begin to break right see that was the thing that was to be preached in this day was the opening of the seals which would open up the entire word right see then I told you about that the prophet would say first pull Divine Healing second pull prophecy all right and see then that would be there's a difference between the word prophecy and prophesy right right and if I spell it wrong you put it in the right place okay you know but see one of them means what you're saying the other one means the the push from behind you or the the you know you and what you're doing see a prophet would come forth and bringing it and say thus sayith the Lord so and so is going to take place see that was him prophesying or you know the why deal on but whereas the other would be what he sent forth from his lips the prophecy see a prophet would say so and so and so and so is going to happen that's a prophecy that'll take place maybe thousands of years later but his voice was speaking of what God had give him to say all right so then I figured well you know a lot of people they they won't look them up anyway but you know you do it oh beside the way uh some of you need to get your T tapes out out of the rack we've cut down on the amount of spaces for you and please get your tapes out of the racks downstairs and go around in the back back here where the the new place is at where Richard is at and right there on the wall is your text you know of the services and brother Richard and them and all that's on the wall and they're getting a good many in there cuz I'm the one that puts in Brother Richard so evidently some of you not listening it's hard to listen with a tape sticking in that rack down there I found that out okay okay forgive me for being that way but now listen let's just read you got it I gave it to you it's on one that's has got a no back on it all right let's just read see in the Bible you use prophecy and that prophecy p r o p h e c y is dealing with prophesying it's number 4394 prophecy in other words a discourse emitting I guess the way you say it emanating emanating okay from divine inspiration and declaring the purposes of God see that's what this p r o p h e see why I mean right Amen in other words the prophet saying it but when it goes out you've got to wait for some time for it to take place at a later date see whether by reproving or admonishing the wicked or comforting The Afflicted or revealing things hidden especially by foretelling future events see all right used in the New Testament over the utterance of the Old Testament prophets of the prediction of events relating to Christ's Kingdom and is speedly triumph see that's why he said that the word prophecy is a setting in order of scripture p r o p h e c y is a setting of or in order of the scriptures cuz those prophets would bring it the New Testament picks up what they're saying and brings it into order the Old Testament scriptures Paul took the Old Testament and brought into order and and laid those things in order to show you who mzd was and things like that but whereas the p p s Dro down is 4394 Prophet speak p r o p h e s y to to prophecy in other words to be a prophet speak forth by divine inspiration to predict with the idea of foretelling future events pertaining his ESP To The Kingdom looks like almost the same wording right but see one of them is the prophet speaking it the other one is what he says see going out and and telling you of future things all right see then I told you brother Brown said the first pull was prophecy second pull was and I called it sitting in order the word the word so we look at it look on your notes right above there which is paragraph or page 41 souls in prison now 631 1110 the morning service the first three three is perfection that's when the ministry went forth the second pull was the discernment of spirits of Prophecy first was the healing of the sick the second was the prophecy that went forth that no the secret of the thoughts listen when the word itself was made manifest which that's Grace all right now that's Hebrews 4:12 Hebrews 4:12 is the way brother random knew what this disease is worth what I said this morning he could take you by the hand that show up the bubbles the thing but something happened when he say it's in your left lung right see that was going on into the interior all right watch he goes on down page 46 if the first and and second pull is without question is there a question in your mind about the first and second pull did it come to pass just as he said then why question the third see why would you question the first two was identified by the scripture I've proved to you this morning that the third's identified by the scripture too look upon the world and see where she's at look how they have rejected the truth and how it's been properly identified the prophecy part see they've rejected the prophecy the truth see all right going down now to anointed ones at the end time 65725 notice the very day when this messenger not when he starts on the but when he begins to declare his message see the first pull healing second pull prophesying third pull the opening of the word the Mysteries revealed all so now would be enough to bring it to you there one more that I didn't bring but it's page 41 of souls in prison and he says that uh anybody believed him seemed like is that right when he went forth Healing The Sick everybody wanted him in their church but one day he turned around and started prophesying what for he was the word he was the prophet that Moses spoke of now that sound like he just started turning around prophesying now watch what the prophet said he done and when he went to telling them and and how that they were living and the things they were doing he became very unpopular that was his second pull all right so just follow the point of what I'm saying there an arguments you can people say well what is the first what is the what well he said it was the opening of the word so that's that's up to you whatever you want to argue the point I'm not going to argue with you about it I just try to preach the gospel all right but get what I'm saying the prophet's message began through the opening of the word of the seals that had not been brought right his early Ministry was a restoration of about what the original doctrine of the faith of the fathers right cuz that was not there in people we had gotten totally away from the original Faith but he did and when it did now watch the third pull being the opening of the word compare the days of the Prophet as I said this morning morning compare his early Ministry to his last days of his ministry now like here is Brother Gary CR brother Hal sitting back there that the only that's the two in joy and uh we're sitting there uh Charlotte and were sitting there when the prophets you know when brother R was bringing his ministry but in the early days it was just healing after healing after healing after healing but then it got down to slower in the last days didn't it right lot less of it but what more powerful he was begin to speak the word and just say I prayed for a thousand people y said I believe they're healed but he said take that baby to the doctor little girl he said I guarantee you healing see he was coming into the third pull right all right now coming into that third pull of the opening of the word you don't see great things only like five seven times of the third pull that he mentions now I said mention because it happened plenty of times that he didn't tell us about right all right but see then in that there would have to be if that's true though that those things if there was a third pull of the speaking of the word right and healings and and deliverances like the storm the uh sister hat right the uh uh help me with it sister mey with the the growth and and you know all kind of things storm storm and about five times or six times the spoke well then it have to be a message right remember we read this morning if there if there's a message there's healing if there's healing there's a message right you said well what about them out there they're only gleaning off of what that we have amen that's right brother brandom on the said where they would say on that voice of healing magazine you know fast and pray for God to send a prophet he said they felt the pull right right they were only feasting off of the pull it was not for them see it was if they could accept it and believe it I see it was for for you and I all right now so the early Ministry dealt with the resurrection all right Lord Jesus early Ministry debt with Resurrection but then one day he began to say I and my father's one right and then he walked on to prove that his father and him was one because he preached what mankind knew nothing of Y see they may have been looking for a general Resurrection right but he said one day I am the resurrection amen and he went on to prove that he was the resurrection because he raised Lazarus the different ones he raised from the dead well here's the prophet's Ministry repeating in the end time that about seven times people raised from the dead see proving that the ministry of Jesus Christ was back here again standing in a man upon the Earth all right but for us to just keep looking at that I'm not doing that that's what all the preachers do see oh it was great and brother Rand his great back I believe that same God is here now amen that's right I don't back up no statements whatsoever with that I'm saying God's here I've seen him here I've seen him deliver and heal and raise the dead that's right so I don't back up the man's got the goods he ain't scared to put it out I'm not afraid to talk about the resurrection I'm not afraid to talk about these things the only thing I ain't seen now is blinded eyes open bless him that's the only thing I ain't seen cuz I've seen the dead rais I used to have to say I didn't see the dead rais didn't that come to pass so the Lord will send the other too but listen see when the Lord Jesus begin to say though I and my father are one the healing maybe uh what do you call it dropped off right the great things because nobody wouldn't comeing to hear him that's right that's it they didn't want to come and hear him they thought we're afraid to go hear him because all these Pharisees and Sadducees trying their best to kill this guy right so let's get away from him you know and that's the way it was in the last days the prophet used to preach to you know thousands of people in one meeting get down to 25 or 30 in a trailer I turn what is Arizona you know and stuff like that look like his ministry went totally down but it's greater and greater and greater amen but what it done it got rid of the garbage right amen now I don't mean that wrong cuz all of us started out garbage right that's all we are until God gets a hold of us right thank God for being able to believe a word amen like sister Gil talking her this morning and about the seeing this young girl you know she said I might not have been that bad but said ain't no difference right well that's true MH you see this nakedness going on out there and you say well i' never done that well that may be true that's right but what's the difference when you pull it on up a little right you know they don't see that on thing I jerk my pant's legs up you know then dresses starts and I noticed somewhere around year yours gets getting and just climb higher and higher and higher and higher and higher and just you know and then the talk goes lower lower and lower well you're responsible to God that's right cuz you know better right and God's Vindicated so you know better amen so go ahead I can't make you do nothing right anyway but see Jesus went on as I said when he said I am the resurrection I am what always been spoken of I'm the one that raise you and that's what I had in the scripture I used the other night but where if the spirit that within him be in you it'll also what Quicken what your mortal bodies am make alive these mortal bodies so Jesus goes on there in John 11 see 21 through 26 to not only say I am the resurrection but he said he that believeth in me amen shall not die right spoke right on down to a chain of the body that somebody going to stand right here and not have to die and why can't we believe we're them come on I believed it for 40 years 40 something years now why can't I believe it any further another old Baptist preacher said a you when I left he said ah Sam you'll be back in 6 months that's been the longest 6 months I've ever seen but have been about 40 something years now and and see I'm still looking at the same Resurrection but I'm beginning to see the message is real in reality all right now let's get on to it all right most people had their concept as I said this morning of the Resurrection but yet in that concept was like ma that it would be out there somewhere you know in the latter days and Jesus was trying to pull it down to the point of saying look you said now isn't it not this is this not in the scripture didn't Martha say if you'd have been here she had enough confidence in the man she said if you'd have been here my brother wouldn't have died just like Mary had enough confidence when it come down to the wine at the wedding you know and she said whatever he says do you do it a lot of confidence had gotten into the why because they had seen so much of God living among them well so is it in the last days amen why can't we believe it that way but see when it comes down to do it we must receive not just the The Plan of Redemption for the soul right that has been the days gone by that's why God wented the ignorance of man to believe that he would get a new body right cuz he knew there was no way to explain it to mankind right so he has to go forth with a healing campaign to start to the ability to be able to express it MH and then sends a prophets were bring the word to but then his ministry as we covered this morning would start with the opening of the word the opening of the seals and then he had about 3 years Ministry there which was the same way of the Lord Jesus see you go back and compare it but even in the Lord Jesus he only had you know the last 6 months was the the main part cuz that was where he went from Transfiguration to Calvary amen all right and see then we're dealing with the hear ye him of that point to understand the Redemption of the body right who who was speaking of the Redemption of the body right even today after the prophet has brought it where is it out there that they're speaking of the Redemption that's right oh yeah they may be talking about it oh yeah because if you hear something you can talk about it right right but then you go to them and start asking them about it y like I always said you know somebody come up to you and they'll start saying oh yeah boy it's getting bad ain't it the end of the world Ain well you say okay they're fine they're happy they'll go on we talk about the end of the world but all you got to do is just say yeah that's right said man it is bad I don't believe we can be around here very long the way things are going now nobody knows the day or the hour yeah see they don't believe what they're talking about they're just saying what somebody else saying that's right well nobody knows Gainer down now be careful now what did we read there in the scripture since our fathers went to sleep we heard this you remember the scripture we just got to read that's right Peter we've heard these things Y and since our fathers has gone to sleep we've heard these all of our life that this is going to take place you know what brother R said one day about it he said that was the greatest sign that was fixing to take come to pass that they begin to talk about it was going to come had had not come to pass he said that's the greatest sign that it was fixed to come to pass so you look at it today oh no no no it may be 50 years from now I'm 70 one see well how long do you think it be well about 25 years oh that make me somewhere about 96 you know in 96 I probably wouldn't give a hoop when the world come in right amen I probably wouldn't even know it even if I was alive that's what brother Carol the other day said and I thought you know first and he might not like me saying this but he's one that said it he said somebody said brother Carol said you know I think it's close to the coming of the Lord don't you he said my age 83 I think he is or 86 something he's right in there he said my age it don't make much difference I fix to step over one way or the other well death is not too bad after all is it if it going to be around here 20 more years somebody better get ready cuz I'm going to step home right you either I'll be down in the nursing home Ling and looking but anyhow listen folks you know yourself at what I'm trying to say one thing outside of this prophet's message where was anybody ever speaking that's right of the full Redemption of the soul to really have an understanding grow development adoption Etc now everybody's happy we're saved we're going to heaven everything you know like my brother said this so long as I get there Sam I don't care well I hope he got there yeah I do but but we just what are we doing right what are we doing the prophet has brought the message amen see I keep clicking back to that because that was one of them know one two three points you're supposed to wrote down see I'm not talking about right the change of the body I'm trying to preach it amen right it's been revealed right well when are we going to preach it okay drop off that said ain't enough for you to hold on to what you're talking about and not try to figure it out just let it go see right I'm not looking for something I'm looking at it okay cuz that's the way we got to be all right now the prophet would say then that we would get the complete Plan of Redemption that was finished at Calvary but see we looked at Calvary as only for the soul right but Calvary see there was a body hanging on Calvary we'll get back to it in a minute that they beat it and his blood dropped on the earth to cleanse and claim this Earth that's right am amen more was taking place at Calvary than just well look at him he died in my place see that's all people want to preach he died in my place wonderful but that's like brother Brown said about Billy Graham he said nobody preach salvation like he did to get people to repent right but he said now what's going to happen right he said they float back in and but just go back into them denominations and you don't float around and don't do no good come on now right see all right but you see we've got to talk about the Redemption of the body right right all right and to do that the prophet in the future home if you listen he he done to me kind of like uh John you remember on patmas one of them we read John on patas he looks up and he sees the city coming down and he describes a bride you remember that and then another time he sees the bride describes the city right you couldn't tell the difference in it that's right so there wouldn't be any difference in the Redemption of the body right see and the Redemption of the world because our bodies come out of this earth right amen all amen now if I can hold a point I'll get back to it in a minute wait now we're talking about the other tonight and I may repeat this again later you know that that Jesus had to go to the spirits that were in prison right now why does it mention right that he only went and talked to those who were disobedient in the longsuffering in the days of Noah that's right it doesn't say that he went and preached to the spirits in prison of all mankind had been put in prison am come on why did he say in the days of Noah right now we'll get to it a minute we'll quote it you know it yourself your body was laying in this earth right abely amen right you come out of this Earth sure all right but do you realize that the bodies of those people who lived from Adam to Noah those bodies were not justified that's right got quiet a you you see I'm trying to say something to you folks come on you tell me he said to those that were disobedient y in the longsuffering the days of Noah but brother R said your body was justified into flood amen see we're not talking about one of these days the last two quotes this morning I withheld them because I've been using them before where brother Brown said it's your body's growing on it's in the process now you see we've stepped ahead of the world right in a lot of respect right but we'll get down to it in a minute if you read the future home you've heard the prophet say that your body was justified yep when the world was washed amen y absolutely in the days of Noah yep that's right see so it doesn't say that he went and preached to those as a witness that had died from where he was back to Noah doesn't say that right he said well that's just assumable okay I'm just making a point too see he had to go talk to them people cuz they had no connection to a bodily Redemption because it started in the days of Noah I hope you read the future home over again that's right and notice the things the prophet had to say not just read the book to where you can raise your hand I read it brother Dale right like brother dick says he does kind to analyze it you know I hope he's still doing that and older he gets he probably don't analyze as much but I hope he's still doing that see we got some things to get to when we get there and that's why you got those things to take place but let's get get back just back back up with me now just a little to get a a straightforward moving point see as I said nobody preached the Redemption of the body and there was nobody preached the Redemption of the world it was an Annihilation right that even the scriptures seemingly speaks of that cuz in Revelation you see a new Heaven and a new Earth new Heavens plural Y and Earth singular right right now in Peter it seemingly is speaking of a total wiping off of the blasting away of nuclear and whatever it's the burning over you know and even in Isaiah 65 he said I create a new Heaven and a new Earth we so we took all of that even the scholars Etc and they took those things and taught us that we don't know where we're going we don't know what's going to take place but one of these days wh something's going to bang this thing and and we're going to go somewhere don't worry about it now we're going somewhere but we don't know where and and we may all be playing Hearts so you need to learn how to play one while you're here you know cuz you may need it when to get tired well you musicians will have it on me cuz I can't do nothing you know I tell you I get static on the radio you know but now listen when the prophet's message came forth he saw the complete Plan of Redemption right for Body Spirit Soul Man see and the world right because now if our if we're not going to get a new body y right are you listening if we're not going to get a new body and our body come out of this Earth through the process of mama and daddy eating you know Etc and genetics came and and all of these things comes into view and you you come forth and your body comes out of this Earth all right it don't spun down out of the sky now Jesus was created but we we don't have that problem I mean that ability so then if you're going to have not have a new body now look what you got to do you got to deal with the world right see why you you you think that I drag and I do too I think oh God I'm just dragging my feet and and I get into something and then when I do there comes a spot I need to explain that yeah see right but if we're going to deal with the Redemption of the body we're going to have to deal with the Redemption of the world right cuz our bodies come out of the earth so it's not just something I I want to do it's what I've got to do we've got to deal with it and God has dealt with it in his word right and put it in there for us to understand that's right but yet we didn't understand it so we had to send us a prophet amen that's right to be able to tie again together and like I said this morning there's those great theologians sitting there with all them degrees and and brother R say no Resurrection no Divine Healing well we don't believe that like he believes it he just an illiterate old Kian but when he stood out there and said if I'm I'm not right you come up here and straighten me out right amen but they didn't get up why didn't some of those big hoopty doopy guys you know get up and walk up I want to show you a lot of them had done heard the story about Dr B right yeah right that's right when Dr Bess was going to challenge the Divine healer yeah and brother random wouldn't even talk to him brother boser said please let me go cuz if you don't said they're going to the people you know they need something let me go he said if you want to argue with him you can go and brother Brandon wouldn't let brother Bosworth even argue with him brother Bosworth just asked him one simple question brother brownon sitting there he said I never thought of that myself brother bosor said I want to ask you one simple question said the seven compound names of Jehovah do they apply to Jesus Christ yes or no brother best brother R said he knew better to answer cuz if he said he was the Savior then he would have to to say that he was the Healer right the brother Dr beess you know brother best there he had him tied up brother R said he' done a great camelite sermon of Salvation and all of these other things but it didn't do no good God come down had his picture made that's where it's that one that's up in Washington DC you know the only Supernatural picture has ever been made that they've proven that it's right amen and when he did see and I checked on that and they say it's in the in in what it's Missoni in but it's down in the basement that you know naturally ain't going to let it out very far but it was there all right but now listen the Lord Jesus surely understood the complete Plan of Redemption will you go with that right all right the Lord Jesus be in the word then the word would go with that agree the word would have to show us the complete plan of Redemption which would include the Redemption of the world but yet as we read it see what do we get we read the Bible and got a Trinity right we read the Bible and got hell is being Eternal y right we read the Bible and decided we can just about do anything we're all going to heaven because long as I believe right see but was that what the Bible said so the Bible didn't change and brother randam didn't have to get a new Bible right had he started talking about a new Bible that we needed I'd have started going back to the Baptist Church blessing so would I today if I found the prophet talking about that we got to get a new Bible and got to get a new knew this I just turn around and go back somewhere and I just assume kiss the Pope's toe if I was going to leave the word from where I am now i' just assume kiss his ring and bow down to him as it do to anybody else he said oh you're silly no I'm not silly I mean every word I say my whole life is St upon whether or not this message is right cuz if it ain't right we got a problem but as long as it's in the Bible we don't have a problem we just keep feasting upon what's in the Bible he didn't come to bring us another Bible see all right then truly if the Lord Jesus understood Redemption he would have to put it in the word are you listening yes see because he would have to bring the plan into the word see and he did in Matthew 24 right see all right the opening of The Seals All right you ever notice brother around and said serpent seed was revealed and seal right you know serpent seed was preached in 58 right go check your dates it's preaching 58 brother Brown said it was revealed in the seal he said marriage and divorce was revealed in the seal he said the Rapture was revealed in the seal he said thank God for the opening of these seals in the last days to understand these things they might not have been revealed to him the day he preached the seals but they was in the seal I know I Ed preachers in this message I know it but after I preached in 1983 on the seals and through that 82 and 83 I said they one of you guys added one word to what I've said right people don't like that I didn't mean they hadn't preached greater things and I did I just meant they hadn't added one word right I meant what I said and said what I meant they hadn't added one word to it because in no seals is the complete Plan of Redemption amen right that's why I said gold Le read the titles of the sermons after the seal they all go into eternal life did not the prophet say after the opening of the seals the Bible had become what a brand new book right you say a different book understand he said a brand new book I've heard people would hadn't even read the seal book and they said boy bless God since I come in this message the Bible will come a brand new book still TR carry into the core sorry it just folks it just gets on me why that there there's one message why there's so much split over one message one Lord Jesus and they wound up being thousands of denominations and but anyhow see then if if the Lord Jesus said it and put it in the word then he couldn't leave us with man's ideas right he had to send a prophet that's right there was no choice it wasn't no problem it was no thoughts you remember here a while back when I was preaching about there was a word for each age the word for this age is God sent a prophet amen he would be the only one who would have the divine revelation all right he's gone by the grave waiting on you and I amen but he went to the Grave with the full revelation of God's word right he knew the Plan of Redemption why preached it to you and I right right CU it's in the message amen see then truly as I wrote it this way the prophet understanding the complete Plan of Redemption the prophet understanding the complete Plan of Redemption he would know how that Paul would be speaking of mortal coming to immortality Etc changing a m in the twinkle of an eye right he would know those scriptures you couldn't say well Paul Paul told us we change one day we CH PR like Paul told us amen but he didn't tell us how that's right that's right I remember reading in the Hebrews there and how that the Prophet come along one day and he said see there and it sounds just exactly like you how did the prophet say it said he's trying to get out of our minds that the Lord's coming right then he said Paul was trying to do that trying to get out of people's mind well when I read it I thought Paul was saying the Lord's coming next day yeah right that's what you read that's what you thought but brother Brown said he was trying to get it out of the mind of the people that God was coming right then said there got to be a falling away right and to be a falling way you got to be somewhere before you can fall and the people of this message are the only people that can do that kind of fall right amen that's right amen we have to have an opportunity to believe it y right amen then we can fall all right cuz you see we we believ that the world was going to be destroyed we believe that that these bodies would be made we get us a new body cuz these old bodies going to be going to be destroyed like I said to brother preaching and said we'll just walk out one of these days over in the Millennium and the glorified body all over our own body iies you know just stomping around uhoh brother colie I didn't mean to stump on you I'll move over to where Wade's at you say silly no it ain't silly that's sill what you think you see those are popular people y cuz people don't want to hear the truth right I found that out a long time ago people don't want to hear the truth that's right you tell them that people tell tell me I had two certain Brothers I always mention they got up one night in The Minister's meeting and both of them said I want you to tell me like it is I don't want you to soft sopic tell me like it is I got up behind him I said you don't want me to tell you like it is I said cuz you couldn't take it and I meant them too right they couldn't take the truth cuz I tried to get it to them and both of them turned against me for trying to bring the truth to them you say tell me the truth brother Dale that's a good way to lose people yeah you know if I ever want to get rid of brother K I'll just go tell him the truth you know why cuz if he ain't got the Holy Ghost you know what he's going to do he's going to leave and if he's got the Holy Ghost he's going to have problems right right cuz I'd be the same way that's cuz the rest of my life the devil would be telling me what's he got against me what's he got against me what's he got against me I'd have to fight the whole thing so the best thing to do is preach the gospel amen just preach the gospel and we all pray that God will take care of our problems don't raise your hand and say brother Dale come tell me the truth now you know better you so we're Christians we can take it we can he said you sure don't have much confidence in the Holy Ghost I got a lot of confidence in the Holy Ghost I just ain't got no confidence in me and you is that plain enough yes that's don't have nothing to me and you that's right sure if you got the Holy Ghost you'll line up but it'll be hard that's right amen it'll be hard cuz I tried my best to tell you the truth right and I've lost friends because I tried to tell the truth it's a good way to lose friends if you want to just go tell them the truth but now listen so the prophet then would be given the Plan of Redemption as the Lord Jesus had the Plan of Redemption you agree right cuz not why don't you depend upon him as a prophet W you depend on your ideas cuz you know what your ideas was you had them all messed up that's right see that's the way I depend upon the prophet's message I look at anything and I said Lord I thought I understood that yeah but now what is it that I don't understand he said well go ask the prophet so one day I wondered I said Lord what is a new birth he said go ask the prophet so I running into computer and said brother brandham what is the new birth or what is the Holy Ghost what I believe what is the new birth right I S Christ mystery God reveal he said the revelation of Jesus Christ in a new birth personally to you you know what I got the right answer we was over in South Carina and at a meeting and there was a question asked and brother colie may have to help me even remember the question but there was a question asked yeah what was the mark that was put on Kan well these two well known in the message well well no okay in the message it was with the prophet both of them said he didn't didn't know what it was well we start back down the road and we're driving down the road and brother colleague looks over me too you know what I know what the Mark was that was put on game I said you do he said yeah it was unbelief that's right he said I just heard the prophet say that's what it was well you know evidently them other two guys must not listened a lot you know and I hadn't listened enough to know what it was so I'm not throwing off on them I he said y I don't know what it is the brother R said it was unbelief y okay all right now get the point right God would deliver to the prophet only after the prophet had reached a position of the faith of the fathers himself and had brought the message of restoring the Bible back to where the apostles understood because remember now preach this to you right that the Lord Jesus didn't tell the apostles everything they didn't know about the seals and the things right they didn't know about son of man now you show it to me in the Bible you show it to them in brother br's message where they understood right M now they didn't understand what the Lord Jesus said he only opened their understanding as to what they could handle on the day of Pentecost but knowing that he would come in the last days right like I say about it when he said there in Matthew what is it 13:16 or 1613 who did man say I the son of man am Peter said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God he never asked him that he asked who the son of man was right he said thou the Christ the son of the Living God Jesus said flesh and blood is not revealed that but my father and on my on that Revelation right there I'll build my church but see he was going to come in the end time to explain who the son of man is but you see then we've got to go to the prophet's message right see to get our understanding it's not what I think that's right what I think is what I thought wrong right you agree with that yes we had a lot of thinking but our thinking was all messed up the prophet came and brought the message well brother there I can show you 100 quotes where he says this and 100 quotes where he says that which one do you want I want both of them because it'll tell me something one day when the Holy Ghost can reveal it or if you got 500 that says one thing and one that says something different to it hold on God reveal it to you one day if you're sincere of what he's really saying right amen and you don't have to change neither one right y right you just go right on down the road right man believing him cuz if he was the prophet of God he had to be Vindicated that's right that's why when he was preaching the white horse rider like it was he had to be straightened out about and there was nobody in the world could straighten him out he had the lens and all of the doctrines and the things he had him but that didn't straighten him out right even Clarence Lin Tau that the White Horse R was the Antichrist Liv Clarence Lin was that one I always quote I knew I read it many years ago that's right cuz he believed that the white horse rider was the Antichrist that's way before brother brandham that didn't straighten brother brandham out it took God to come to that Pro amen and show him that's right all right but now listen amen so then there would there won't be any difference now watch there won't be any different you you you can't have a doctrine of like one thing going this way and then you got to get something else to go this way and something else to go around that way it won't work in the Bible that's right so whatever the doctrine is or the Redemption of the soul will have to be applied to these bodies amen and whatever Redemption of these bodies are of the soul will have to be applied to the world right Y and that's why I've asked you over and over please read the future home cuz that's what he explained right he said if I don't get nothing to you I want to get you the Plan of Redemption that's right see now let's read a little bit and we a't going to get time to go through all of it we'll take this up Wednesday and finish it cuz we'll get a few of the notes anyway look at number three on your notes like I said I started to print the whole book from page 14 to about 23 even more you know of the future home cuz I thought a lot of people maybe they'll read if I give it to them but I decided not they don't read if I give it to them cuz no need wasting the paper well I already understood I read that book 14 years ago we'll try an update version okay and an update version Don't Change what the prophet said the update version is in your mind amen amen amen updating of our minds to where we can understand right a growth velopment in Christ we don't need a no updating of the Bible updating of our human being so look what he said number three on your note which is page 14 of the future home preach 1964 802 and notice how God makes plain to us his Plan of Redemption oh this just thrilled my soul when I saw it brother Brandon you've been preaching from 33 all right to 63 at least that's right he said this just been revealed to me it thrilled my soul when I saw it statue of a perfect man he said I had these things but said this come to me the other day when I was down in the woods and there I had a shout and Glory Hallelujah time believe that oh think a lot of people believe that brother R knew everything when he came well that's not even Jesus didn't do that because the Bible City he grow in Grace and knowledge but now listen notice how God makes plain to us his Plan of Redemption oh this just thrilled my soul when I saw it how he makes plain to us here now his Plan of Redemption now compare what we see with our own eyes that God has done done to redeem his world he's done the same plan to redeem his people for the unchangeable god changes not any of his plans or anything such a glorious thing so whatever the plan is for the soul the plan is for the body whatever the plan is for the body is the plan for the world okay everybody understand that point that'll hold it to where we can can keep it going look it goes on down cuz where you got the line going down your paper it means a continuation of reading okay same page 14 how he led us to himself to a Tabernacle in Us by three stages of Grace just like he's led the world in three stages to come through the world as God will come to the world after it's gone through three these three gone through three different stages of purification that's exactly how he comes to us through the three stages of Grace I've Ted that at the beginning I've never changed it changed since it's God's word you know there's people in this message now said brother Brown change the new birth yeah so now brother around said it's just the Holy Ghost but now according to him there he said that he had changed well you know what that I tell these other people there must be Liars here but now look back in his early Ministry 1950 10 110 on a Moses commission brother Brown says that's in the Plan of Redemption you are redeemed and when you get to baptism of the Holy Spirit that's the earnest of your salvation or is that right in other words it's a down payment and if it'll make us feel like this on a down payment what will it do when we get the full benefit of it to be it'll be glorious War it well then do you believe that you'll raise again and have an immortal body this is 1950 how many believes that in the in the resurrection and you'll raise and have an immortal body Divine Healing is the down payment or the earnest money of your Immortal body see my see what I mean you got to have it's the evidence that you'll have an immortal body when you see even back in the 50s he would speak of an immortal body but go back into early Ministry and find him speaking a lot about the Redemption of the world he may talk about Redemption for the body he may talk about no Divine Healing no Resurrection right but when the sealed open to that prophet he started talking about the Plan of Redemption for the world cuz he knew then if we wasn't going to get a new one we going to have to come out of the world that's right it comes out of the world then it's not going to be annihilated like we think see we think it's all going to be blowned away the Bible says brother Dale that heaven and earth will pass away well like I said stuff shirt Theologian why didn't he look up pass away Peter said it John said it on patas y look around says Daniel saw the same said Paul said the same right if you read the future on but here's them stuff shirts that knows all about what them big words mean but a prophet had to get in a dictionary and look it up and see how to find a word and then learn how to spell it right it's on down in you notes he had to even spell the big old word see why pass away me passed away well and I'm not meaning this wrong I mean it in the right form brother Tom here the other day passed away right that's right but did that annihilate his body no no we can go down and dig it up it's in a coffin waiting right did he pass away as a person on the fact of a soul or anything no right because we can show that it's beyond the curtain of time amen so we need to change our thinking amen now cat may be cat in English language or human terms but when you come to biblical form sometimes you got to find out some other things to understand right it don't always mean what we think y they were so smart until we don't realize it all right so then we start into the future home on page 13 and what did he say number five when you know it's only the atmospheres around it and the sin that's upon the Earth that will be destroyed right okay amen amen I'm trying to find the other one where I could get on down to it but we just slowly go down if you don't believe that that's what the prophet said then you listen to the next message let's see if I can find it where used the big old word spelled it out 17 17 number seven 1 17 okay I'm glad I put numbers on there where you keep up with it yeah number 17 he covers it and that's page 27 of the future home he covers the big word and spelled p a r e r e c h o m i a which does not mean annihilated it means to change from one form to another all right you know that when you receive the new birth according to Paul in Corinthians you become a what new creature a new creation did you pass away you know did you just annihilate it you went down to the altar you know you got down praying and you just disappeared right you re see the Holy Ghost just he just gone because that's the same word y brother Bram gives it to you and after you read it where Jesus said loose the cat and tell him to bring it he said it's the same word that's right he said when Lazarus was dead if you read the future home you've heard the that when Lazarus was there in the grave it said loose him and bring him out and take the bra the grave clothes off of him loose but you see we've all thought that everything would be annihilated we don't know what kind of thing going to take place what's going to be but this whole thing just annihilated it's destroyed the prophet said only the atmosphere is around it and the sin that's upon the Earth will be destroyed all right and you're going to have to Wednesday for the read the future home so if you hadn't read it that'll give you an opportunity to either read or listen to the tape cuz these these bodies are not going to be destroyed you can burn me up right but I'll turn back to gases and gases is where I came from in the beginning that's see we believe in Redemption yes sir amen the soul wasn't destroyed by the new birth it was just washed right Justified cleansed Sanctified and got to baptism of the Holy Ghost and Fire to burn out anything that was left in us with the Holy Ghost to come and live in us right that's the new birth brother said it wasn't your soul that died he said it was the nature of your soul not your soul no right the new birth right the Plan of Redemption same for body same for soul same for world all right see let's read a couple right here before we finish this get get your H page number six which is on page 13 He says and all this exists in the heavens or atmospheres in the earth which is now this Earth holds those things but it wasn't made for that purpose you know they've traveled to the Moon see as far as man goes he got to be cleaned one day as far down as we go and there's Wells that are thousands of feet deep right and as far as man goes that way it's got to be cleansed y you said well how can that be that mean the world wouldn't be no bigger than a basketball you just remember when the flood took place it sure shifted this stuff around right it did that's right amen but just remember over in the Book of Revelations you don't have to worry about it now it's not going to do away with the water but it's going to do away with the sea because there's no more Sea called water is H2O two parts hydrogen one part oxygen the greatest explosive situation that can be y that's why they were afraid to set off the first or split the first atom because they were afraid it would start a chain reaction and probably if they hit it correctly according to science they did not split the atom at perfectly dead center they missed it just a little probably if it hit it dead center it would have blow the whole world you see they only got what God wanted them to have right that's right right that's it so what did he say and all our bodies that we live in now was put on the earth when God created it because you're out of the Dust of the earth am okay the Plan of Redemption let's get the next one and we'll quit it refers to three stages of the earth Peter said this it refers to the present world we live in now called it a world the old world that stood out of the water and the world that is to come three stages we'll pick up right there Weds to the Lord but you go home and you think about it this world it already went through justification right and sanctification right and just remember our bodies were in the world when Noah right and the blood our bodies were in the world when Jesus blood dropped on it right so we're already in the process because when God gave you the Holy Ghost and you're not going to get you a new body right if you believe that by now that it settled you ain't going to get a new body take this point when God put the baptism of the Holy Ghost in you he cleanse and claim that body you're living in you're not going to get another one he laid claim on it right there amen you say yeah but look how bad it is look what we used to be look what the world used to be right that's right but what about the Plan of Redemption that's right you might want to consider some things and think about it see that we need to know the Plan of Redemption amen right amen we need to know it for the body amen we need to know it for the world Amen we need to know it for all these things the prophet said the ACT atmosphere in other words wherever man has been to pollute it is going to have to be cleansed as deep as he's went in it's going to have to be cleansed y because he's laid it on there and made a mark out of it right and you see if we don't believe in a worldly Redemption why wouldn't Jesus accept what Satan said in his temptation right he said all of these things and brother randam said he showed him all Russia and all said he showed him United States that's what he said yeah Satan showed it to the Lord Jesus and said I'll give it to you Jesus said won't do it got to pay the price same thing as Abraham when Abraham was coming down through there and his wife died he said I need a place to bury my wife man was real nice to him he said I'll give it to you he said no boy that's a slap in the face a the man offers you a burial plot you turn around and say I ain't going to do it I'm going to pay for her well why you want to be so stubborn Abraham said I want to pay for it see he didn't know what he was doing but the Lord Jesus knew what he was doing when he said Satan I'm going to buy it because brother R said he knew that Satan would have an ear mark on the world y that he could still deal with you and control you if he had an ear mark on you he said well sin has no I thought we were supposed to be dead right Can't Be Your Mark right Jesus Paid the price am Abraham bought the burial plot y wouldn't let him give it to him typ in Christ to come to Calvary to die for you and I he didn't have to do that and if we're going to get a new body why did he have to worry about getting beat up and killed in this kind of a body come on Amen all he had to do was just back up to heaven and say come on y'all follow me mhm y right mhm he had to go through all that horrible thing because there was going to be a Redemption of the body let's stand come on brother thank on these things think on these things the same plan for the world is the same plan for the body the same plan for the body is the same plan for the soul The Plan of Redemption what do you think about it Jesus said I am the resurrection he said he that believeth in me shall never die believest thou this somebody's not going to have to die CU Jesus said it Paul said it Jesus said it brother randam said that's enough to be three Witnesses right that's right think on these things what we got let's R number 61 in the red book 61 in the readed book anybody have a need see I believe in Divine Healing my hope is BU nothing than Jesus blood and rightous I dare not trust sweetest but holy Le on Jesus Christ on this word remember what the old brother said I'd rather be standing on the word standing in heaven because the Bible said Heaven and Earth away read the future home if you don't have
