appreciate you all uh coming back tonight i know most of you didn't leave but uh it's good to good to see you again and i just feel a little bit more comfortable a little bit more at home so you know just gonna let my hair down what's left of it and and we'll just have a good time amen but uh once again just appreciate brother samuel having us in and uh you know to stand in the pulpit of someone who's who's pastored for 50 years and has stayed true to this message and preached this gospel with all of his heart it's a very i told brother brother samuel it's a very intimidating place to be uh you know i've only been pastor for about six years i'm still just a kid and uh to step in the in the in the footprints of these men who have uh uh they've made the path clear uh they've they were the the path breakers they're kind of like a john the baptist ministry of bringing those low places high and bringing the high places low and straightening out the crooked to make my job easier and and if the lord should tear these young people who are coming along behind us it'll make it the path easier even for them and that's that's the mission that's what we're working towards uh to make that path easier and so uh if you would we're just gonna jump back into the word uh this morning we're gonna start in uh second corinthians chapter five we're just going to continue on kind of where we were this morning but in a different direction uh but talking some more about ministry and this morning we spoke about how the mechanism or process of ministry functions how god prepares an individual for your individual ministry or pulpit ministry whatever it may be and how that that works god trains you uh through hardship and the afflictions that the devil brings upon you and uses those experiences to then allow you to speak or testify and and through that process we're able to minister to others and so now we're going to talk a little bit about the purpose or the mission of that ministry so uh and and i know brother uh i told you to start at verse five but we're going to start at verse one and we're going to get get a little bit of context here for we know that if our earthly house of all this tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of god a house not made with hands eternal in the heavens we spoke this morning about there being an eternal reward not to get stuck on the uh temporal but to look towards the eternal and paul's letting us know we've got a home waiting for us for in this we groan earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven if so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked for we that are in this tabernacle do groan being burdened not for that we would be unclothed but clothe the pond that mortality might be swallowed up of life now he that wrought us for the selfsame thing is god who also hath given us this earnest of the spirit therefore we are always confident knowing that whilst we are at home in the body we are absent from the lord for we walk by faith and not by sight can you see a theme here we will look into the invisible we are confident i say and willing rather to be absent from the body and to be present with the lord wherefore we labor that whether we be present or absent we may be accepted of him for we must all appear before the judgment seat of christ that everyone may receive the things done in this body according to that he hath done whether it be good or bad knowing therefore the terror of the lord we persuade men but we are made manifest unto god and i trust also are made manifest in your consciences and we'll stop right there for now and bow our heads father we thank you once again for your goodness and mercy and lord as we sang the song tonight we want to see you tonight and we're lord the way we are able to see you is not through as the world would turn to spirituality and these things but we see you in your word and so father we look to your word and we ask that you would open it to us and that god we might see you clearly tonight we might see the mission that you've given us and the ministry that you've given each one of us and god that we might excel in that and have great success and god i pray for each one here under the sound of my voice that lord if there's some that are struggling tonight god you would touch them and you'd give them the strength that they need if they're those who are weak in body and need a healing touch may you touch them right now if there are those who have questions if those who are are hounded by worry and doubt i pray god that you would give them confidence and you would give them a sure word tonight lord not through me as a man for my sufficiency is so inadequate as a human being god i cannot help anyone i can't even help myself but our sufficiency tonight is of christ so we asked father that you would just speak to each one of us and that god you would open your word bless us lord in jesus name we pray amen amen you may have your seats we're going to continue on reading the chapter here and then and we'll go back and get into to some things here but he says for we commend verse 12 not ourselves again unto you but give you occasion to glory on our behalf that we may have somewhat to answer them which glory and appearance and not in heart for whether we be beside ourselves it is to god and whether we be sober it is for your cause and we talked this morning about uh being a nut for god being a little bit crazy and paul says look if we get a little bit crazy brother graham says look if if i get a little beside myself if i get a little bit happy if i seem a little bit crazy just leave me alone i'm happy the way i am and and david experienced that same thing he got to a place to where he was so lost in god he said you know this crown i don't need this crown i just take this crown off these royal robes they don't mean nothing because the ark of the covenant god is here in my city god is coming into my home and he got so excited his royal trappings he just had to tear him off he was having such a good time he was beside himself he got completely lost and it was under god it wasn't a show off to anybody else so much so his own wife got embarrassed over the whole deal got a little bit of david what are you doing oh my goodness what are you doing he said look this isn't a show for you this isn't a show for the public this is for god amen and so paul says if we get beside ourselves it's unto god but but if we have some moments as ministers and and in your ministry when you get them all a few lucid moments you get a few moments where you can put a thought together it's for your sakes it's when we come together and we read this word and god gives us understanding it's for your sakes and so he says for whether we be beside ourselves as to god whether we be sober it's for your cause for the love of christ constraineth us there's a constraint i talked about that fire inside this morning it is to god uh because we thus judge if the one died for all then all were dead and that he died for all that they which lived should not henceforth live unto themselves but unto him which died for them and rose again you are not your own you have been bought with a price wherefore henceforth we know no man after the flesh yea though we have known christ after the flesh yet now henceforth know we him no more now don't think that we don't know christ anymore but what he's saying is we do not there's lots of people who understand christ as a historical figure of 2000 years ago every christmas people go to little manger scenes and they they worship the god of 2000 years ago the christ of 2000 years ago they see him in his flesh and some say he was a great philosopher and some say he was a great teacher and he was a good man and he was this that or the other but i tell you he was not just a good man he was the son of god and knowing him in the flesh would not help you at all how many people broke bread with him sat at a table with him who shook hands with him who heard him speak how many of that five thousand that day of men who ate that bread and loaves of fishes how many of those were there in the upper room how many of those were there along the path how many were there just knowing him after the flesh is not good enough you've got to have something more than that and so he says this that henceforth we know him therefore if any man be in christ he is a new creature and old things are passed away behold all things are become new he's talking about a new birth he's talking about a new creation he's talking about a new work and all things are of god who hath reconciled us to himself by jesus christ and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation and that's what i want to talk about this is the mission this is the the what we are called to this is the purpose of ministry is to continue the ministry of jesus christ which is one of reconciliation and so we see then that we're we're to whit god was in christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them who hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation amen now then and i can slow down right now i don't have a two o'clock time time limit so i'll try not to preach quite so fast but i'm excited amen now then we are ambassadors for christ as though god did beseech you by us we're ambassadors not just the men standing in the pulpit you're an ambassador as though god would use your voice to speak to a lost and alienated world and this is what he's saying as though god beseech you by us we pray you in christ's stead be ye reconciled to god amen this is the mission this is the gospel to be reconciled back to god and we see that at the beginning we we talked i think yesterday i got to find some way to tie all these together so uh it got to be some continuity but we see in creation in genesis one in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth and the world was without form and void and there was a there was chaos and i want you to to remember that there was a chaos there was there was nothing overseeing it was spinning kind of out of control but god moved upon the face of the waters he brooded over it brother branham said he made love to the world and and through that process out of chaos he began to he could began to create order he began to move upon it and and we see in the garden that when god placed adam and eve there there was there was a perfect unity between god and man because when we're talking about reconciliation in order for there to be reconciliation first there has to be alienation there has to be a separation there has to be a loss of fellowship this is what god is desiring fellowship remember when he created the heavens and the earth and he placed adam and eve there it was so that he could have fellowship with himself we are him she is him and so adam and eve when he placed them there he's coming down in the cool the evening to have fellowship with them and and that unity that was formed there that was god's desire that was what he had created all this for and and that unity was there and everything was in perfect harmony and and there were no thorns and there were no thistles there were no weeds in the garden there was no difficulties that we have to deal with today none of those things they didn't have to own a manure spreader they didn't have to have a a weed eater they didn't have to have any of those things everything was in perfect order and as even though adam tended the garden it was it was more of kind of redecorating the house you know i think adam and eve together he would say you know i think i think a row of apple trees across there would look really good and adam says well i think peach trees would look a little better you know and and i don't think they got into much fuss about it and they said well maybe we'll just alternate a peach and apple peach and apple pizza now and it was so they had dominion they had control and let's move this tree over here and that tree just moved over there and oh let's create a mountain vista over here and oh that's just beautiful what do you think god will think about i think he'll be he'll really like it and when he comes down in the evening we'll talk about it together there was a unity there there was a unity between adam and eve and between the two of them and god and that unity i tell you the devil doesn't like it he don't care for it and he says brother branson says you'll notice how the adam or the eve was united with adam she become a part of him god did you notice in genesis 1 27 he created man male and female created he them now the man was both male and female when it came to the being and the spirit of feminist and masculine then god took from his side a rib did you notice the body part was a byproduct but not the spirit the body part of the woman was a byproduct after the creation had been finished god took from the side of adam a rib and made a woman but not the spirit the spirit was part of adam for he was both man and woman feminist speaking naturally spiritually speaking both masculine and feminist now don't you see the great picture we're in the flesh we and the flesh are different we're we're like a byproduct so sisters if you get upset about the the term byproduct you're a byproduct we all a byproduct right yeah okay we're like a byproduct a created being by holy wedlock but in spirit we are sons and daughters not some other spirit but the spirit of the living god we are in his likeness in his unity in the perfect image of the living god because we become sons and daughters not separated but the same spirit the same god the same spirit joined in wedlock to the eternal see how god planned it that we should not be a different but him we're not different but we're him he came down in the garden to have fellowship with himself all right separate uh i got a bigger print now not some other being of some other tribe but a real union and offspring of the almighty done by a holy union now the body comes from mother and father but the spirit comes from god god separating himself as adam was separated on the day of pentecost we find the holy spirit the pillar of fire separating itself and setting upon each member of that church god putting himself together then with that group of people together what does it do it brings back the unified body of the lord jesus coming together and in this great day of great separation that we're living in great separation that we're living in you know the civil rights movement all that stuff we were supposed to be united together but we're as a country more divided than we've ever been there's the media everything is seeking to divide us but god seeks that we be united a united body and united in purpose the bride of jesus christ is not going to have any schism not going to have any division she's going to be united amen he says he says what a pity what a disgrace but we're joined in heavenly wedlock to the eternal guard part of him part of god and flesh i become branham because of my father branham and you become part of your father and mother but in spirit we become in union with god part of god that's the reason that the spirit cannot die he that believeth on me has everlasting life and in the image that he is here on earth and in his likeness i'll raise him up on the last day not a spirit being for we'll have a body like god's glorious body the glorified body of jesus raised up in that image jesus said going to the great grave of lazarus i am the resurrection in life he that believeth on me though he be dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believeth in me not on me but in me being in him believing and if you abide in me and my words abide in you in him believing oh my i hope the holy spirit gets that right down to you we've got to be in him united with him and this is the ministry of reconciliation is to get us back in unity get us back and fellowship get us back to what we lost in the garden and this is what satan hates and this is what he's fighting so hard against and this ministry of reconciliation is is what we're moving through and what what what uh we're called to be a part of amen we're to continue that it was in christ reconciling to himself the world and he's given us amen the ministry of reconciliation right now brother graham says this and god's provided away he says that great evangelist he had a good thing but i think he approached it wrong and he's talking about billy graham and you know i'll just say this that you know the angels have left saw them right he said that billy graham and oral roberts were the two angels sent down and they're off the scene now judgment's coming amen so don't knock billy graham don't knock oral robbers they had their calling they fulfilled it we have our calling let's fulfill it but he said he approached it wrong he said the thing of it is you lazy preacher sit with your feet on the desk and don't go out and talk to the people so that's where it's laid and and he said that in the context there if he said i go into a city and i get 30 000 converts and come back a year later and can't hardly find five right and this is what he thought the problem was it was the preachers but brother and says this but billy what preacher laid his feet on the desk that that one that had one of paul's conversion it was because that today we just stop at the waters of separation and don't take them into fellowship with the holy ghost and the power of the shekinah glory you get a man in that condition and he'll burn a city down with the gospel nothing can stop him he's got the spirit of god upon him he don't need nobody to coax him god's right in him just burning up the sin as he goes he can't stand still why he's entered into the fellowship by relationship relationship he's born again he's a new creature in christ he come through the waters of separation don't stop there friends don't stop there he walked through the blood of sanctification don't stop there friends he went into the fellowship of the of the holy ghost yes sir he's born into the fellowship god's only provided approach [Music] there's no other way there's no other approach nowhere no time or any way only through that and as i said our denominations i appreciate them and and i'll say this let's not let this denominate let this denominational spirit come into the message and i know it's there it's been working for years but just putting message on the door is not any safety net to you it will not save you it will not keep you yes i believe it's the best place in the world for that relationship to be to be uh initiated and grow and and what it needs to be between us and god but you can't just come to a message a church and think that's good enough you can't just say i believe god sent a prophet and think that's good enough there's got to be more than that you've got to come into that shekinah glory for yourself you've got to come into relationship with god for yourself doesn't matter what mom and dad did it doesn't matter what grandpa and grandma did my grandpa was in brother branham's meetings he got prayed for he got healed but that won't help me a bit all right i've got to know him for myself our creeds that's perfectly all right that serves the purpose of a brother they'll never take the place of the blood of jesus christ they can't because that's god's only basis we should be zealous of our denomination we should be zealous of the message and i'm not equating it with a denomination but i'm going to tell you this be very careful because it can become a denomination oh yeah if we think well we're in the message there's not much difference but saying well we're we're a methodist or a good baptist if you're using that as the um your safety umbrella all right you got to know him for yourself two million people followed the messenger of moses they ate the same manna they heard the same message they believed it but they did not mix it with faith the bible tells us and because they didn't do that it profited them not one bit right amen they walked through the red sea they drank the water out of the rock and they died in their sins oh god help us and and i'll tell you this i appreciate that was a fine job brother it was a good good sermon that was a wonderful sermon that was that was wonderful i'm a human being and and i appreciate that somebody brother branham had preached a sermon and afterwards somebody came to him so brother branham i appreciate that was really good somebody just got offended on that and they said i said you shouldn't you shouldn't do that taking god's glory and brother braham goes no no no he says i'm i'm a human being and i like it he said the only difference between you and me is i'm honest [Music] but understand this just coming to church and hearing a good sermon being entertained or getting a good feeling i tell you what as a minister i i don't really care about that i know brother wade doesn't our brother here doesn't no no none of us none of us ministers care about that what we care is that god touch you that god change you that your relationship with him was furthered that you got closer to him that he did something eternal on the inside this isn't about entertainment this isn't about making you feel good as you drift off away from him yeah come on come on you want that there's plenty of churches you can turn on the tv and join thousands watching services that'll make you feel good as you drift away from him but this ministry this ministry we've been given is a one of restoration one of reconciliation to bring us into communion with god bring us into a relationship with god to restore what was lost in the garden that god and man could come down in the cool of the evening and walk together this is the purpose we should be zealous of our denominations trying to make it grow that's fine that's good i appreciate that but i'll never take the place of the blood no sir so we see that god god is in the reconciliation business he's in the restoration business he's restored he's in a he's that's his job that's what he's into and so and and it's our job to tell the truth and i know i'm skipping around brother you just this is the way i do it so and convinced then concerned 1962 he says it's our duty it's our duty to people to to really tell the truth right amen because you're going to meet it again we said we're going to stand in judgment one day on what we brought and in the first book of corinthians it says look there's no other foundation in christ but we can build upon it we can build with sticks we can build a stubble we can build with with stone we can build with gold we can build with precious gems the ministry gives you the tools it's our job as ministers to give you the tools to build and we're like an 84 lumber yeah we're to take this world word break it down and give you the resources you need to build a life a life not on sam's not on the sands of this world but on the solid rock and foundation of jesus christ but it's your responsibility what you're going to build on it what you do with it and it will be tried by fire and only what stands at the end is going to be what matters and so we we're 84 lumber well you you want some two by fours we'll give you some two by fours we'll give you some drywall we'll give you what you need you need what whatever it is that's the the job of the five-fold ministry to supply you with the material to build a life with christ and so he says and we're going to get judged for what we say amen that's right this morning he says the the the scripture and you'll forgive me for time we won't go back but but but it says that they'll stand with them and brother branham remember when he went beyond the curtain of time he was gathered with his people amen we'll be gathered with ours you all be standing under brother samuel's uh ministry and now my group will be standing under me and we'll be standing under the ministry of brother branham and and it'll all be in this kind of pyramid deal all coming back judged on what we did with what god gave us and so we find then that he says this having knowing therefore verse 11 the terror of the lord knowing that that someday there's going to be a judgment and we'll have to stand before him he said he says knowing therefore the terror of the lord the seriousness of the situation we are made manifest unto god but also made manifest unto you and we persuade men amen i'm not a salesman but i'm a billboard and i'm trying to each one of us ministers and your ministry is to be a billboard to display christ to a lost and dying word to a world to be a light in darkness it's part of your ministry one of of reconciliation because the world is in it's in it's in a state of chaos because when this unity that we spoke of here in the garden when sin entered the picture instantly instantly unity was broken here comes god in the cool of the evening adam didn't cry out to him adam didn't run to him he ran away from him and here comes god down in the cool the evening adam adam where are you adam calling out to adam unity was broken i was afraid i was afraid so i hate myself he'd never they'd never felt fear before they had they never experienced what fear was can you imagine horrible that must have been yeah from a small child we understand fear we have that feeling we we feel terror we're terror we feel anxiety and all of those a result of unity being broken because perfect love casts out all fear but because of that unity being broken now we now we have anxiety problems now we have depression now we have oppression we have all kinds of issues we have fears and worries we have all these things and here adam i hid myself because i was afraid he had never felt that before i don't know how we don't know how long it was that adam and eve were in the garden before the fall because time didn't matter it wasn't kept track of because they were in eternity but when sin enters the picture the clock begins to tick fear enters the picture and now they're separating themselves from god hiding and as soon as god confronts him with the issue he says the woman you gave me now remember just a just a few verses earlier the bible tells us that adam was not deceived adam looked upon his fallen wife adam he was in his pre-fallen state he was in a clarity of mind he knew exactly what he was doing and he looked upon her and he made a decision and i'll leave you with this question did he make the wrong decision oh that's a deep question did he break god's word that's a deep question because while he may have disobeyed the letter of the word he kept the spirit of the word because he could do no different than what he did because he was his father's son amen amen the second adam did the same thing that the first adam did he became sin that through his poverty i might become rich in the righteousness of god he did the same thing and then he's willing to die for her and then a few verses later he said well it's her fault what had happened unity had been broken fellowship had been broken and god was desiring to get that fellowship back and before the foundation of the earth he slew a lamb to restore that fellowship and the promise was was was moving on through time looking for looking for one who could fulfill the promise looking for one who could answer the call looking for one who would restore back all that adam lost and christ was born to restore it and that work that he began 2 000 years ago this bride will finish up you're bought with a price you're not your own so we verse 19 brother to wit that god was in christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses into them and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation so this idea of reconciliation alienation this is not unique to first or second corinthians uh well it's not unique to any book of the bible the whole bible talks about alienation and restoration so in colossians chapter 1 verse 19 it tells us this for it please the father that in him should all fullness dwell so in order to restore fellowship god came himself no one else could do it he came himself to do it and having made peace through the blood of his cross what if brother graham said it's not going to be your denomination it's not going to be your creed it's not going to be your philosophy it's not going to be the name of the door it's not going to be who your pastor was they're not believing that god's not a prophet it's through the blood of jesus christ by him to reconcile all things unto himself and by him i say whether they be things in earth or things in heaven he bought it all back every bit of it and you you that were sometimes alienated what does that mean fellowship is broken alienated when when uh if you say well those those brothers need to reconcile that means that they're alienated from one another there's a break in fellowship they're no longer buddies and something has to take place to reconcile that relationship to bring them together and so he's reconciled us we were sometimes alienated and enemies oh we weren't just drifting away from him we were flat out enemies to god where in your mind oh you may not have said it you may not have acted it but i tell you what goes on between these ears that's why we need to be transformed by the renewing of our mind by our wicked works yet now he hath reconciled how do you do it in the body of his flesh through death to present you holy unblameable and unreprovable in his sight and this ties back to the idea of of not imputing their trespasses unto them david said blessed is a man to whom god does not impute sin blessed is the man to whom god doesn't keep track of your sin god doesn't keep it in his book it's in the sea of god's forgetfulness there it's kept and he puts up a big old sign that says no fishing and that means i can't go fishing for my sins and i can't go fishing for your sins once they're in there they're in there leave them in there that's why he said don't know don't know any man after the flesh this is why he he introduces that concept we're new creations what you did before i tell you leave it there what happened before leave it in the dust do not carry that guilt do not carry that shame do not carry that cloud do not let it walk all over you do not drag it with you you are a new creature in christ jesus [Music] thank god sir thank god but we we drag stuff up all the time how many of you in the middle of night the devil shows up with the daily catch well i've been fishing today you know he did the same thing to god where where you been oh i've been wandering to the throat just wandering to and fro doing what well i've been fishing do you know what brother so-and-so did yeah god says no i can't can't find it can't find it hey devil says i got a youtube video bro hello god right here man god says well i'm checking the official record i don't see you and since mine's the only one that counts your evidence is inadmissible oh thank god [Applause] blessed is the man to whom god does not impute sin this is psalms 32 1 blessed is he whose transgression is forgiveness sin is covered blessed is the man to whom god imputed not iniquity in his spirit there is no guile in rome and this was so good paul had to quote it in romans 4 6 he says even david also described the blessings of the man unto whom god imputed righteousness without works and this is what what what paul is talking about here in second corinthians not only not only if we get to verse 21 second corinthians 4 i know five i know i'm jumping around hang on in second corinthians 5 21 he says for he hath made him to be sin for us that we might be made the righteous righteousness of god in him so it's not only that god doesn't keep track but god switches the names on the bank accounts you had a debt you could not pay amen not in a billion lifetimes there was nothing that people think well if i'm a good person i can outweigh the bad i've done with the good you could never do it you don't even know the damage you've wreaked in your life some idle world word or thing that you didn't even know leaves your lips and once that arrow leaves the bow you cannot call it back brother and that does damage and hurt and pain that anyone who's married to tell you pop up 10 years later where did that come from well you said i i don't i didn't say i didn't say that oh yes she she's got a better memory than you do fellas because you remember what you meant she remembers what you said oh we're not going to get into marriage counseling tonight but men and women are different yes you say one thing she hears another amen [Music] but we we leave wreckage in our path we say things and we do things and all those things and we need someone to pay the debt yeah and so god takes that huge debt that huge account that we've accumulated over our life and not only not only the sins that we made in our past before we come to him and we become new creatures but even the sins and mistakes that we make after we become christians and the sins you're going to make brother bram says you're going to have problems in this flesh right up until the day you get out of here you're going to have battles right up until the day there's always the question of when do i get to a point to where i won't have any struggles it's the day you step from this body to the next you're in this world there will be trouble right but be of good cheer he's overcome the world and so god takes that debt and he switches the names on the account jesus was judged by pilate i find him innocent he's not guilty of anything shuffles them off to herod what do you think of him herod looks at him and says i find no fault at all he was judged in every every way and found perfect his account was full full of what righteousness was god and we who were alienated we owed a debt we could never pay and at calvary god switched the names on the account he took your debt and laid it upon him and he took the wealth of heaven and gave it to you oh what what a glorious reconciliation he not only restored our fellowship but he wiped away our deaths and he made us rich in christ but how many have heard the term entropy a few few of you i know i'm using big words it's not because i'm smart but god created this world and remember it was without form with void and god it took effort from god to place it into order and he put man there to keep it in order and then when sin enters the picture things begin to spiral out of control now there's thorns and thistles now by the sweat of the brow man has to earn his living didn't before that if you wanted an apple you didn't have to wait till fall didn't have to ship it from south america it was there all the time whatever they had in need of it was perfect harmony perfect unity that fellowship is broken sin enters into the world and then this concept of entropy and you'll you'll you'll hear this a lot of times in people who are debating creation and things like this but the second law of thermodynamics brings in this ideal of entropy entropy in that things do not get better over time if you go out tonight and if you can find one you bought a brand new gmc truck and you took that brand spanking new truck with two miles on it and you park it in your backyard and you leave it for 20 years it will not be better at the end of that 20 years than the day you bought it it won't even be as good as it was the day you bought it things decay over time things drift apart over time you can't even you say well i'll just park it in my garage and i'll leave it there that doesn't even work no you got to change the fluids every once in a while you got to fire it up every once in a while you got to let the condensation evaporate out of it you've got to roll it so you don't get flat spots on the tire there's work to do to maintain order there's something that has to be done because i know i'm speaking tonight there and i pray if there's someone here that does not know god who has not come into a relationship with god who does not know him for their savior who doesn't ha does not know for sure that they've moved beyond a justification move beyond sanctification but they've entered into that holiest of holies they've entered into that shekinah glory they've come into a new birth if you have not come to that place i say to you be reconciled to god that's the process of reconciliation but but i'm speaking for the most part to mature believers and know this that ministry of reconciliation isn't just out there to a lost and dying world as a ministry of reconciliation and keeping you in fellowship because the law of thermodynamics the the that ideal of entropy is that this if we don't maintain things decay things in this world you build a brand new house you know you think well i'm not going to have to do any repairs or any work on it for a few years you got to mow the grass stuff breaks things happen you got little ones you get real good at patching drywall and pain crayon off the walls just through everyday living things decay and through your everyday walk with christ we drift oh yeah we drift oh it's not you can be you can live a good life you could i'm not doing anything wrong i'm not going out in the world i'm not visiting the bars i'm not running around i'm not doing all these different things i'm not i'm not doing sin i'm not doing all these things you're just parking the car in the backyard and time we begin to drift things begin to drift away and fellowship gets and so this this ministry of reconciliation part of it is keeping us in tune with the almighty right it's not just to the world out there but it's in here amen uh staying in communion us staying in fellowship us staying in lockstep with him because over time we'll just drift we'll just if you you take a boat and you put it out in the middle of a lake there may not be a current may not be a breeze but you just put it alongside the dock you say i don't need a rope it'll be fine i don't need them there's no motor on it there's no sail it'll be fine and you wander away well it'll wander away and if you want that boat you're going to have to go for a swim it has simply drifted away remember joseph and mary they're in jerusalem and they're there with jesus and they're loading up to head out with a caravan and they've they've got the they've got the truck loaded and they've got their suitcases in there and everything you see jesus yeah he's over there and they get in there driving down the road on their camels we had a brother a friend of mine dear friend of mine was driving one night late at night his wife was laying over in the seat covered up in blankets they were coming back from some meetings and she was tired and laying over there sleeping and he just stopped real quick to use the restroom got out used the restroom jumped back in his vehicle going down the road and some of you know where this is going he didn't push her out he didn't ask her to leave but his phone rang he flipped open his phone it's two o'clock in the morning i don't recognize this number who in the world would just be so luckily he didn't just say and hang up he answered it and his wife said where are you he didn't mean neglect so great of salvation he didn't mean to but he had to turn around and come back to restore fellowship and let me tell you friends it was a lot of work to restore fellowship we find joseph and mary and i use that story to illustrate just how easy it is even in ministry we get so busy doing things like as we talked about moses this morning he's going off to save uh the israelites from egypt he's going there to confront pharaoh you want to talk about having a lot on your plate you want to talk about you're all consumed with this mission that god has placed you upon that you forget the mission his wife was one of those that needed saving his children were one of those who needed saving and he's he forgets all about him and god confronts him at the end is going to kill him and his wife stepped in to restore fellowship because he hadn't even done what needed to be done for his own family and we we can get so busy and so caught up that we doing things for god that we forget god we move away from god and as ministers and even in your ministry whatever it might be we can get so caught up in in doing things for god that somehow we think that we're still in lockstep in communion with god when somehow we've left him along the way we begin saying prayers instead of praying we begin going into a routine and and just it gets to a place to where to where we think he's along in the vehicle we got joseph and mary in the vehicle and they're moving down the road and they get three days out and suddenly they realize he's not there and gotta turn around and come back and god desires my reconciliation amen paul paul is crying out and this is the ministry of the bride the spirit and the bride say come on when fellowship was lost in the garden cherubims were put there with flaming swords keeping them away from the tree of life saying don't go near it but now god has given this ministry to the pride he's given this ministry to us not to keep people away but to say come come to the tree of life and eat freely if you're a thirst come to the tree of life we've all we all know someone we all have family members we have children we have brothers we have sisters we have parents we have uncles we have ants we we're we're kinsmen redeemers to them no one else will enter into prayer for them brother wade and brother samuel uh the different brothers it's not their job to be you're a closer kinsman all right your life should be screaming out to them be ye reconciled to god amen i'm not talking about conforming to some standard of religion i'm trying to look the part well if we could just get them we could just get them into a dress if we could just get their hair to be long if we could just get that fella to cut his hair if we could just get him to cover up those tattoos if we could just get him to do those things no if we could just get them to christ get them into a relationship with almighty god get them to they know this god who loves them and has been calling to them we get people who who well you know once i give up this i'll come to church how many have heard that i've got these problems i've got this situation you know once once i get that sorted out you know i'll be there i'll be there i'll be there they'll never be there nope that's right they'll never be there because you can't clean yourself you can't fix yourself come as you are and let god do the process let god do the cleaning let god do the thing if you've got problems and i could take a show of hands when i know the answer how many of y'all got problems all have sinned and come short of the glory of god we've all got just because my issues ain't your issues don't mean i ain't got issues we've all got places we've all got weaknesses we've all got places where we need to grow and i know this because we're still here man but if we take those things and we say well i can't i can't go or you know at church just keep coming keep getting into his presence let his word wash it well i just feel like a hypocrite god saves hypocrites too amen coming let the word wash you let the word change you let god bring you back into fellowship with himself because know this we get people who say well you know i i just don't i think god's done with me i think he's i've gone too far i've said too much i've made too many mistakes i you don't know what i've done you don't know this you don't know that and the question i always ask the question that's always at the bottom is do you feel any desire at all towards god whatsoever and if they say yes of course i do but i i just feel like i've gone if you feel any desire towards god whatsoever god had to place that desire there there is nothing in man that would cause him to seek god adam ran from god so if there he said no one can come to me unless the father draws him and so if there's something knocking at the door those of you who are praying for that loved one for that son for that daughter for that wayward brother for that wayward sister for that mom or parent or what whoever it is know this if there's something there don't give up hope don't get just just keep there letting your life be a light be salty to them love them express the love of christ to them keep reaching out and when i say be reconciled i'm not talking about get get in church and look a certain way i'm not talking about paying your tithes i'm not talking about all those things that'll come much later the important thing is is they come to know the almighty god and enter into that fellowship that god has desired from the foundation of the earth and that the two become one once again and through that process of the new birth his spirit is deposited within them and they're no longer alienated but they're family amen this is the mission this is the mission of ministry for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life and i know that that's to some of you oh yeah i've heard that's a tired old uh methodist sermon or a methodist idea no that's the word of god for god sent his son not into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved when we're out of here judgment's going to hit and so it's our our final voice to this world is completing this ministry not to condemn it but that through us it might be saved as many as you can and whether they're bright or not or whether they're foolish virgins or not or whether they're this or that that's not for me to know that's not for you to know every person that you come in contact with is a potential son or daughter of god and need to be treated with the same respect and love that brought you to know him amen and he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten son of god and to sum the mission up god came to restore unity to restore fellowship that's still the mission still the mission hasn't changed calvary made it possible and we're still doing it brother and his ministry part of his ministry was a restoration ministry and the bride of jesus christ and continuing that ministry as well amen there's we don't have to restore the word but we have to restore or be the culmination of that word on display so first timothy 1 and i'll end on this the musicians can come because i'm just flat wore out first timothy 1 15 this is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation that christ jesus came into the world to save sinners yes of whom i am chief amen and let me break it down for you christ the messiah the king of kings the lord of lords the alpha and omega the anointed one he who comes in the name of the lord the great physician the great shepherd the mediator between god and man the one pointed forward to in all the old testament and the prophecy and the law and the prophets it's the the christ jesus which literally means the lord who saves came into the world god condescended was made a little lower than the angel stepped out of eternity into the corruption of mortality and was made subject to death and suffering to save to pay all the penalty of our sins as a substitute what was that penalty death not just of the body but of the soul in hell to save sinners all of us for we all like sheep have gone astray and we're all alienated from the presence of god without hope and in need of a savior and paul said of whom i am chief and i know above all others i need him amen for there is no good in me at all except for him this is the mission friends should you choose to accept it and it won't self-destruct but i'll tell you this it will disappear one day ready or not here he comes all right amen all the musicians come you love him tonight amen thank you all i've had a ball love y'all don't you come on up yield yourself to god that's what you get right there my brother did a wonderful job and uh when i get to go up there now in just a few months maybe i'll tell him he's a little different than he is when he's cause i've heard him preaching his church and he's a little bit different than he is he's out here so uh a little bit more of an evangelist yeah absolutely no doubt so god bless you let's sing a song and worship the lord if you have a need god's here to supply you need [Music] oh what can wash away my sins nothing but the blood of jesus what can make me whole again nothing but the blood of jesus oh precious is the flow that makes me white as [Music] i know nothing but the blood of [Music] jesus this i see nothing but the blood of [Music] jesus [Applause] [Music]

richard's got to get back home and we got to go back out in the devil's playground tomorrow but i hope you got some ammunition now i hope you got something that you can fire back at him because you
