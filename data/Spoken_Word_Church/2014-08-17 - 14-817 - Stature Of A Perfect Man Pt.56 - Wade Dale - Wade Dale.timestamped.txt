[0:52] this now look paragraph 101

[0:59] down across the doo and this is Sister
[1:00] Shepherd she dreamed she was on a
[1:02] mountain and in this mountain the best I
[1:05] haven't got the paper before but I think
[1:06] it's like this cuz remember brother
[1:08] brandham seen the dream he's a prophet
[1:10] he saw the dream told her the
[1:12] interpretation all right she dreamed
[1:15] that she was she saw a rock box like a
[1:18] framework sitting right in top of this
[1:22] mountain okay now it can't
[1:25] sit you couldn't sit right here anybody
[1:28] see that it ain't FL
[1:31] it's right here that's where it was
[1:32] sitting
[1:34] right cuz head had come yet and she saw
[1:38] a large man her husband was behind her
[1:41] she saw a large man standing there with
[1:43] work clothes on sleeves rolled up
[1:45] bailing the most pure water that she
[1:47] ever seen and pouring it to a box this
[1:50] Rock Box sitting on top of the
[1:52] mountain and The Rock Box would not hold
[1:55] the water it rolled right out over there
[1:58] and just boiled up all the trash and
[2:01] sticks may I say all the
[2:05] achens back to what we were just talking
[2:07] about it's boiling the this is boiling
[2:09] the achens out of our camp cuz to me
[2:12] these are the achens these are the
[2:13] things that we what did Ain do he did
[2:15] something he should not have done he
[2:17] knew better cuz remember God said don't
[2:20] take nothing destroy it all don't take
[2:23] anything right that's same thing with
[2:26] this how how are we going to have
[2:27] Temperance if we got that little root of
[2:29] bitter in us or our brotherly kindness
[2:32] if we got that little root of bitterness
[2:33] or something in you know we can't do
[2:35] that
[2:36] okay things still had turned on the Rock
[2:40] Box would not hold the
[2:42] water I want you to pay attention The
[2:44] Rock Box would not hold the water now
[2:46] brother I'm just going to explain what
[2:47] this is so
[2:49] listen it just boiled up all the trash
[2:52] and sticks now realize in your mind
[2:53] here's a guy standing on the mountain
[2:55] pouring water in a box and the box is
[2:57] boiling up with water but there's sticks
[3:00] and trash rolling out over that water in
[3:03] the water coming
[3:05] out see that's a type of God pouring the
[3:08] word in the water of the word and burn
[3:11] and taking all the trash out so we still
[3:13] have trash going up the pyramid yes just
[3:15] like I said there was an aching in the
[3:17] camp and he was already in the promised
[3:19] land so right here's the promised
[3:21] land Faith that's our Promised Land
[3:24] that's the faith Seed of Abraham that's
[3:25] our Promised Land circumcision not of
[3:28] the flesh but of the heart yes
[3:30] Hallelujah okay you say amen amen amen
[3:34] there you go okay and she was asked and
[3:37] B it out rolled down the mountain and it
[3:39] rolled over her
[3:41] feet feet means what
[3:44] Redemption feet means Redemption
[3:46] remember I preached the sermon of feet
[3:48] Footprints feet means Redemption
[3:50] possession possession you're exactly
[3:52] correct right and it rolled over her
[3:54] feet and she was standing right in that
[3:56] stuff only it didn't stick to her uhhuh
[3:59] uh got it didn't stick to her things
[4:03] come just don't let it stick to you
[4:06] that's right like sister John that we're
[4:07] talking about you know something may
[4:09] rise up in you but but if you if
[4:12] you if you put that in some kind of soil
[4:16] and and and let it yeah you in bad shape
[4:20] brother Brown said you can't help the
[4:21] thought coming but you just put it away
[4:23] right can't help the birds flying over
[4:25] your head but don't let them put make a
[4:26] nest in your head only it didn't stick
[4:30] to her and when she asked why the Box
[4:33] didn't hold it the man said that is not
[4:35] water that's the Holy Ghost all right
[4:37] you I said it was a word but a't the
[4:39] Holy Ghost the word okay so I'm not
[4:42] saying something brother R didn't say
[4:43] all right the Holy Ghost is the word the
[4:45] word is the Holy Ghost the only way
[4:47] you're going to get the word is to have
[4:49] the Holy Ghost and then who burns it out
[4:51] the Holy Ghost Burns it out by the
[4:53] reveal word all right I want to say
[4:55] reveal word cuz not by the word cuz the
[4:58] letter kill it all right it's by the
[5:00] reveal word that's right this is not
[5:02] water that's the Holy Ghost now you know
[5:04] who that man was don't
[5:05] you that man was brother
[5:08] Brown the man up there pouring the water
[5:11] in was brother rown he was the only one
[5:12] that was able at that moment to teach
[5:14] that woman how to get up that statue of
[5:16] perfect man right God through brother
[5:18] Brandon through the Holy Ghost he was
[5:21] pouring that water
[5:22] in and said then he went back and got
[5:25] another big bucket and it was full of
[5:28] honey then now brother Brown goes and
[5:30] gets the bucket he's the only one that
[5:32] can preach brotherly kindness the way it
[5:33] should have been cuz that's what that
[5:36] honey is
[5:37] right now it will hold this he poured
[5:41] the honey into the bucket and she
[5:43] thought that the box was a rock box was
[5:45] going to burst out and spill the honey
[5:47] but it didn't it finally stuck together
[5:49] and held it everybody imagining this I I
[5:52] imagine a box sitting on top of a
[5:54] mountain got pouring water in and it's
[5:55] just leaking everywhere water's coming
[5:57] all over the place you're not amening
[5:59] right all over the place and then all of
[6:01] a sudden he goes gets another bucket of
[6:04] Honey pours the honey in and you know
[6:05] what honey does I do we do honey lines
[6:08] everything man it goes in every hole
[6:10] every crevice every crack and seals it
[6:12] up right my question is so can we say
[6:16] that that brotherly
[6:18] kindness lets you be able to be filled
[6:22] with the word exactly if you don't have
[6:25] that's what I'm getting to quit
[6:26] preaching the sermon if you
[6:30] this a lot l i I told y'all brother the
[6:32] kindness was the key did I not all this
[6:36] depends on this coming that's right you
[6:39] got to be here before The Headstone can
[6:40] come that's right it can't come down
[6:42] here cuz look that won't fit it's too
[6:45] little it'll fit right there but Buddy
[6:48] it'll fit right there right right on
[6:50] that brotherly kindness that's why I'm
[6:51] telling you brotherly kindness is the
[6:53] most important cuz that's where that's
[6:56] the difference between all the other
[6:57] ages and that head Stone coming down now
[7:00] brother brandham they said brother brand
[7:01] you couldn't tell who his enemy or who
[7:03] his friends were he had brotherly
[7:05] kindness he's he couldn't stand up and
[7:08] preach that without having it now Peter
[7:11] did Peter James and John and Paul had
[7:13] brotherly kindness they had the Holy
[7:15] Spirit melding it together but they
[7:17] didn't have enough of the word to bring
[7:21] that okay this is the opening of the
[7:23] seals this is Brother R's message a
[7:25] pyramid inside of the pyramid this is
[7:27] the prophet's message right here that's
[7:29] what he come to bring he said not in the
[7:31] years of
[7:32] restoration got it not in the year this
[7:34] is restoration people's already had this
[7:37] this is not something new that we're
[7:38] going to get that nobody else has the
[7:40] first church age had brotherly kindness
[7:43] right all these virtues were working in
[7:45] the book of Acts if you want to see the
[7:47] pyramid work read the book of Acts
[7:50] that's why we went back and read the
[7:51] book of Acts where they had all things
[7:52] common they brought all the money in and
[7:54] they let Peter James and them
[7:55] Distributing the money out and that's
[7:58] because they had brotherly kindness it
[7:59] wasn't like well I don't know what
[8:01] they're going to do with that no they
[8:03] trusted that brother with the Holy Ghost
[8:05] to do that because he had all these
[8:07] other things working in his life now
[8:09] look if they would have perceived that
[8:11] he didn't have knowledge or patience
[8:13] Peter James and him didn't have all
[8:15] these I wouldn't give it to them either
[8:18] they weren't a
[8:19] novice when they received the Holy Ghost
[8:22] 120 in the upper room receed the Holy
[8:23] Ghost they were right
[8:25] here cuz Jesus himself the word preached
[8:29] to them every day for 3 and 1/2 years
[8:31] and it had an effect on them they held
[8:34] it the Bible said they took the word and
[8:36] held it they didn't you know you you
[8:37] seem outwardly that Peter wasn't getting
[8:41] it cuz Peter was always messing up but
[8:44] something inside of Peter was getting it
[8:45] because if not God wouldn't have put him
[8:47] the first man standing on the porch
[8:49] right and he wouldn't have definitely
[8:51] trusted with the keys cuz he told him he
[8:52] said Peter whatever you bind on Earth
[8:56] I'll bind in heaven whatever you loose
[8:58] on Earth I'll loose in heaven now what a
[9:01] responsibility Peter had so on the day
[9:04] of Pentecost he walks out says repent
[9:05] brothers and be baptized in the name of
[9:06] Jesus Christ for the remission of your
[9:08] sins key clicked down here key clicked
[9:10] up there and God said you're not getting
[9:12] up here without
[9:14] that that's what he said okay now we
[9:17] know man's ideas turned into father son
[9:19] Holy Ghost and all those things and God
[9:20] winked at that ignorance but the reason
[9:22] brother Brown come brought that message
[9:24] he did from 47 to 63 was to get us back
[9:27] to brotherly kindness where we could
[9:28] understand understand how to handle the
[9:30] word of God cuz remember power without
[9:34] character you can have power power
[9:36] without character is satanic right W cuz
[9:40] you're going to use it wrong that's
[9:41] right but Power with character you'll be
[9:44] able to use it right okay that's what
[9:46] brother rown was mean when he said power
[9:47] without character satanic he was
[9:49] actually I believe in his mind he was
[9:51] thinking of the
[9:52] virtues Godly virtues not human I'm
[9:55] talking about God sent virtues we are
[9:58] not going to get finished this today I
[9:59] don't know why in the world we're R I'm
[10:01] rambling so
[10:03] much look at
[10:06] done she saw let's see she turned and
[10:09] went down the mountain going down the
[10:11] mountain she stopped at the bottom of
[10:13] the mountain and looked up look back she
[10:16] saw five streams of pure Crystal Water
[10:18] not contaminated by the things that it
[10:20] went through still pure and clear coming
[10:23] swiftly then it slowed up then almost
[10:26] fading out and she was wondering would
[10:27] it ever reach the bottom of the mountain
[10:29] five streams and she woke up she said
[10:31] sister I think that's about as close as
[10:33] to be no more than he picked the letter
[10:35] up he saw the dream all right that's the
[10:38] way dreams are interpreted and he tells
[10:40] that did everybody understand that a
[10:42] real Prophet if you go tell him a dream
[10:45] before he interprets that dream he
[10:47] actually sees the same dream you see and
[10:50] then God can interpret it that way you
[10:52] know he's a
[10:53] prophet cuz and cuz cuz what brother
[10:56] remember many times brother brandom said
[10:58] I tell the people they left this out
[11:00] why'd you leave that out why'd you leave
[11:01] this out why' you leave that out why
[11:03] because brother R standing there seeing
[11:04] the whole dream and they're over here
[11:06] telling him the part they want him to
[11:08] see so you know he's seeing the whole
[11:11] dream because remember if a dream comes
[11:12] from
[11:14] God God don't just take and do like we
[11:16] do and hit delete right well that's
[11:19] forever there it's in an archive
[11:21] somewhere right and the prophet just
[11:23] pulls it out of that archive and he sits
[11:25] there just like a television screen he
[11:26] sits right here and watches that dream
[11:28] so he's watching ing her dream well I
[11:30] believe that's in the scripture in
[11:32] Daniel he's talking about Daniel's time
[11:35] dreaming and he he talks on I don't mean
[11:37] skipping this but we need to now here's
[11:39] the interpretation of her dream she was
[11:41] bothered about the Holy Spirit now in so
[11:44] much as she seen the Box on top of the
[11:46] mountain was the rock rock Box Rock
[11:48] means what
[11:49] confession all right now like Jesus said
[11:53] in scripture said Peter who does man say
[11:55] I the son of man am one says El Li one
[11:57] says Moses said but who do you used I am
[11:59] th are the Christ son of the Living God
[12:01] some people say that he's talking about
[12:02] the Catholic Church what The Rock was
[12:05] the Roman Catholic Church says it was
[12:06] Peter right but it's not it was that
[12:08] rock confession all right not to be
[12:12] disagreeable but my way of sin it's both
[12:14] wrong he never built it on Peter did he
[12:16] build it on himself but he built it on
[12:18] Peter's revelation of who he was who
[12:21] does man say I son of my am th Christ
[12:23] son of living God blessed thou Simon son
[12:26] of Jonah flesh and blood has not
[12:27] revealed this to you some s but my
[12:29] Father which is in heaven th Peter Upon
[12:31] This Rock of confession upon this
[12:33] Revelation I'll build my church and
[12:35] that's been each Church age has had that
[12:37] rock confession on top to this rock
[12:40] confession of the L out of which is our
[12:42] age right now he cannot make a holy
[12:45] church there's no such name as a holy
[12:47] church he talkinging about the Catholic
[12:49] our holy organization the Holy Spirit
[12:51] can be preached in it but in there you
[12:53] find good and bad Renegades indifferent
[12:54] everything else so an organization will
[12:56] not hold right so therefore for the rock
[12:59] this Latter Day Pentecostal Church which
[13:01] has received the Holy Spirit they did
[13:03] like they did at the first all down
[13:05] Through the Ages so see he's not talking
[13:06] about Pentecostal
[13:08] denomination right he's talking about
[13:10] true Pentecost everybody's had if you're
[13:12] born again you had a true Pentecostal
[13:14] experience just like they had on the day
[13:16] of Pentecost but you were part of that
[13:18] 3,000 downstairs that were Spirit babes
[13:21] in
[13:22] Christ everybody understand that you
[13:25] weren't the 320 you weren't born you
[13:27] weren't birth with all these virtues
[13:29] working in your
[13:30] life they have to
[13:32] be walk through journey of Life
[13:37] conquered they have to be conquered
[13:38] you're right
[13:40] right they did like they did it first
[13:42] all down Through the Ages they receive
[13:44] the Holy Spirit but not in the
[13:47] measure that they have it now because
[13:50] it's a restoration of the first Alpha
[13:53] and Omega right as we take the
[13:55] candlesticks Alpha and Omega how they
[13:57] lit the first candle it went higher
[13:58] higher got dimmer and dimmer then come
[14:00] back again first and last so forth now
[14:02] but in this church age the message is
[14:04] being poured into the church but the
[14:06] church body itself all together like the
[14:09] this Tabernacle will say that's where
[14:11] she comes to church this Tabernacle is
[14:12] not a holy ghost Tabernacle there is no
[14:14] such a thing individuals that come into
[14:16] this church is Holy Ghost
[14:20] Tabernacles they are Tabernacles that
[14:22] contain the Holy Ghost but not the
[14:23] church in the body of group therefore it
[14:25] runs out but what this man who was
[14:28] pouring the water the messenger to the
[14:30] church so he's identifying who it is
[14:33] it's him okay the messenger to the
[14:36] church pouring the message into the
[14:39] church but what was the water doing it
[14:41] was boiling out all the trash that was
[14:44] in it that's what the Holy Spirit does
[14:48] boils it up now now the honey
[14:51] represented brotherly
[14:53] love so now he's telling you what the
[14:55] honey is the Honey's brotherly love it's
[14:56] going to seal all this together cuz
[14:58] without brother brotherly glove this he
[15:01] calls this the true baptism now you say
[15:03] well then the other one was false we've
[15:04] had preachers tell us no gen Revelation
[15:09] says that Jesus Christ is the faithful
[15:11] and true witness not that he was false
[15:13] and then he become true it's just you're
[15:15] going to see more light of the truth
[15:18] everybody got that you're going to see
[15:19] more light of the truth that's right the
[15:22] faithful and true witness Jesus was
[15:24] never a false witness that's right
[15:25] saying that well now he's true well the
[15:27] same way with this right here
[15:30] excuse
[15:31] me now the honey represented Brotherly
[15:33] Love brotherly kindness which is this
[15:35] age I just got through telling see of
[15:36] Brotherly kindness the age that we live
[15:38] in now now you might say look I sure
[15:40] don't like brother Neville I sure don't
[15:41] like brother Jones I don't like brother
[15:42] so and so something like that but just
[15:44] let something happen to him brother your
[15:46] heart's broke just nearly kills you we
[15:48] can obtain brotherly kindness and
[15:50] feeling for one another see but to
[15:51] maintain in a group of people so what
[15:53] he's saying is hard to maintain in a
[15:55] group of people am I am I interpreting
[15:58] that okay that's right in a group of
[15:59] people it's hard to maintain brotherly
[16:01] love that's
[16:02] right why do you care for that brother
[16:05] because you've broken bread with him
[16:06] here at the altar as we will tonight you
[16:08] fellowship with him you shook his hand
[16:10] you worship with him he's your brother
[16:11] and you might do something in the flesh
[16:13] that you would disagree with because you
[16:15] just kind of stay what you ought and do
[16:17] but shun him a little but in the bottom
[16:19] of your heart if something happened to
[16:20] that brother it would nearly kill you or
[16:22] that sister I'm an old man I was once
[16:24] young now I'm old I've seen it down
[16:26] Through the Ages do that hear people say
[16:28] I just want have no more to do with him
[16:29] and something happened to that man that
[16:30] nearly killed him thinks oh God I let my
[16:33] precious brother go without making
[16:34] friends with him you see see it's
[16:35] brotherly love it looks like it won't
[16:38] stick but it does stick the honey it
[16:41] sticks now in some months that she come
[16:43] from there down the hill to the bottom
[16:45] of the hill now this glorious water was
[16:47] gushing over Hills in five streams now
[16:50] five is the number of Grace j e s u s f
[16:52] a i t h g a c five is the number of
[16:54] Grace five streams is pouring from up
[16:56] here at the trough down through here see
[17:00] now when he says down through here in BL
[17:02] in Blasphemous names that chart was
[17:04] still up but if you'll keep reading
[17:06] Blasphemous names he'll refer back to
[17:07] this chart okay so he drew this and left
[17:10] it on the chalkboard all
[17:13] right that's what me and Daddy were
[17:15] talking about something the other day
[17:16] and talking about the ministers changing
[17:18] brother Brown's CH of Daniel 70 weeks to
[17:20] fit their Revelation well they've never
[17:22] change this
[17:23] one if brother R was writing one he's
[17:26] writing the other right he's not wrong
[17:28] brother right you just need a
[17:32] revelation each one of these ages had
[17:34] that rock confession I'm sure he's
[17:36] pointing each one these Saints are
[17:38] sleeping waiting waiting waiting waiting
[17:40] see until this age so he's pointing
[17:42] right
[17:43] here right on to this
[17:46] age but soon the Holy Ghost being poured
[17:48] out from Christ will come and seal up
[17:50] the church then the church will be
[17:52] raptured this all right now watch it be
[17:55] a complete unit of God a bride for
[17:57] Christ who will be the head of of all
[17:58] things which he's the head that's called
[18:01] a headstone remember we talking about
[18:03] last Sunday he was the Chief Cornerstone
[18:05] which is the same looking you know same
[18:07] looking Rock it's a pyramid down here is
[18:10] what goes up here you just got to go
[18:12] through these developmental stages
[18:14] right now she was wondering now in Her
[18:17] Dream she was wondering would this
[18:18] little stream ever get to the bottom see
[18:20] it was drying up now being that she
[18:21] herself now here it is what I want you
[18:24] to get to now she herself was wondering
[18:26] about her own self did she have the Holy
[18:29] now shun saying this a few days ago
[18:31] thinking the church would be spiritual
[18:32] enough to catch it when he was preaching
[18:34] The Testament for man and maybe I better
[18:36] turn this tape off right now cuz I don't
[18:38] want to get out this among Brethren but
[18:40] you can speak with tongues shout dance
[18:43] cast out Devils do anything you want to
[18:46] and still not have the Holy Ghost now
[18:48] them Pentecostal people they couldn't
[18:51] take that they could not take a prophet
[18:54] telling them that that's why they turned
[18:55] against and they can't today either
[19:00] okay cuz
[19:03] remember kyus was
[19:06] spiritual bam was
[19:11] spiritual so he said well I'm spiritual
[19:15] okay your fruits are going to show which
[19:18] Spirit you come from because the devil
[19:20] is the most spiritual person in any
[19:23] realm except
[19:25] God that's right in any realm the devil
[19:28] is the most spiritual person that's why
[19:30] this is the most deceiving age cuz it's
[19:31] come all the way down so close together
[19:33] that it would deceive the very elect if
[19:35] possible Lord many will come to me and
[19:37] say Lord I've cast out devils in your
[19:39] name do Mighty Works depart from me you
[19:40] workers of iniquity I didn't know
[19:43] you everybody know what that word no
[19:45] means same one as when Adam knew his
[19:47] wife Eve so it's not a sexual
[19:49] relationship but a it is a union between
[19:51] a husband and wife I never knew you as a
[19:54] wife if he knows you as a wife you're
[19:57] his right
[19:58] so that's what the Bible's talking about
[20:01] depart from me you workers of iniquity I
[20:02] didn't know you in other words the Bible
[20:04] says I never knew you that's the correct
[20:07] correct not correc in a prophet but he
[20:10] was paraphrased in scripture these
[20:12] things are not in indications of the
[20:14] Holy Spirit by their fruit you shall
[20:16] know them now you say brother BR we do
[20:17] should we speak with tongues
[20:19] absolutely but these gifts of God
[20:21] without these virtues listen the those
[20:23] gifts of God without these virtues in
[20:26] them makes a stumble block to the
[20:28] unbeliever that's true listen to this
[20:30] it's not accepted by God that's a strong
[20:34] St I bet them Pentecostal people was red
[20:36] as that table their face was cuz see
[20:39] they build everything on them speaking
[20:41] in tongues shouting and all that stuff
[20:44] and he said it's not accepted by God you
[20:46] know what some of them said who's he to
[20:49] say it's not accepted by God but watch
[20:50] watch what he's saying watch how he goes
[20:52] down through here look this has to be
[20:56] first right what and when you have faith
[20:59] virtue knowledge Temperance patience
[21:00] godliness and brotherly love then the
[21:02] Holy Ghost comes down and seals you as a
[21:05] unit the same as he seals the church
[21:08] ages as a unit all right the way he
[21:11] makes his bride is the way he makes his
[21:13] individual made out of the same material
[21:15] like Eve was made out of Adam the rib
[21:16] from the
[21:17] side here is the things you have to have
[21:20] first I'm sure he's pointing to this
[21:21] chart here is the things you have to
[21:24] have chur first you can't impersonate
[21:27] them you can't IM itate them they've got
[21:29] to be God sent and God born imitation
[21:33] only causes confusion that's right true
[21:37] all right power without character that's
[21:41] right could turn somebody away from this
[21:47] message you got the power the Holy Ghost
[21:49] is a power you got the Holy Ghost you
[21:51] got the power but without character it
[21:54] can be used against
[21:57] you okay I want to warn you power
[22:00] without character is satanic but Power
[22:04] with
[22:05] character it's fit to Ru there's your
[22:07] headstone isn't it amazing though that
[22:10] so many people are drawn to that
[22:13] Pentecostal same thing in the message
[22:14] they do it in the message all the time
[22:15] if you're not real
[22:18] Pentecostal they ain't going to have
[22:21] you we'll finish this next Sunday we
[22:24] need to going
[22:25] up brother Danny's with us today so give
[22:29] you some good amen
