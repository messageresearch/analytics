down his brothers is keep him in your mind okay father we thank you for your love and your grace we thank you that Lord that you would give us an opportunity to be able to take away from life and times and things and to be able to sit down just a little bit and and listen to you talk to us Lord we ask you to come and open our understanding to Thy word because that's the purpose of being here not to just see one another or GA but to hear from you truly Lord open our eyes that we may see that we may Lord not just look our own but be a partaker of that also have your way now forgive our sins bless each one bless those that are sick among us the ones that are not able to be here brother Tom our Lord just reach down and touch him Brother Don the different ones that are not able to be here

you as we read your word now you come and speak to our hearts and our lives Lord let your light shine in Jesus name amen Psalms 1118 if you notice there is no notes to read from this after no you know quotes and things I gave brother Joe a day off he's have to put all of those quotes onto the computer where that anyone that's you know listening and things and doing later they can actually pull down all those quotes you read this morning can be brought down on the computers and things and he has to put them in there so we appreciate that but we gave him a little vacation today he won't have to put nothing like that okay Psalms 118 verse 19 open to me the gates of righteousness I will go into them and will praise the Lord this gate of the Lord into which the righteous shall enter I will praise thee for thou Hast heard me and art become my salvation the stone which the builders refuse is become The Headstone of the corner now we'll try to get on to this more wind Wednesday so if if you miss the service try to hear it on the Internet or not able to be try to hear it this coming Wednesday because we'll be speaking on the hstone this is the Lord's doing it is marvelous in our eyes this is the day which the Lord hath made we will rejoice and be glad in it save now I beseech thee Oh Lord oh Lord I beseech thee send now Prosperity Blessed Be he that in the name of the Lord we have blessed you out of the house of the Lord okay let's go over now to John very familiar scripture with all of us John 1:1 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by what by the word all right all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the Darkness comprehended it not now look over at verse 14 it says and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us now why couldn't man comprehend it they couldn't comprehend it why couldn't he cuz they was looking at it in the wrong way the word was made flesh and dwelt among us we beheld his glory as the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word now I want to try today to just more or less preach a sermon to uh kind of uh go back and cover what we've been talking about and bring it down to uh the present time and that way maybe it will be helpful and if there's any questions and answers I I enjoy questions and answers I I ask for them I love to to do that and uh you know if you have any questions if just write it down brother Dale what in the world you talking about I don't bother me at all I just tell you what I'm talking about you know but uh you know if you have any questions don't worry about asking it and don't worry about it being a dumb question there's never been a dumb question there's been a bunch of us dumb people tried to answer them but there's never been a question that was dumb because it's something that's on your heart and your mind am m me you know so something you want to know about and you know so make sure you do that now that part that's used there in John 1 where it says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God a lot of people has used that to try to prove to Gods CU see there is With God all right but the next part of it says and what and the Word was God they said well what about that word with you know I had never looked it up because it didn't bother me and never even really tried to look it up to see what the the definition of with really means and uh you know I was looking at it a few minutes ago and I thought well you know I never looked that up in the dictionary to just see it's got a lot of meaning to the word with but uh let's see if I can read my own writing wi is a word used as a function f you MCT i o n function word to indicate one that shares see to indicate now point out in other words shares in an action transaction or an arrangement that's what the word with is a it's a function word a function word is a uh a word expressing relationship right all right see I just never looked that up cuz it didn't matter to me cuz I knew it wasn't meaning to Gods but I knew that it had a meaning but it's it's it's actually indicating or in other words pointing at you know showing that there is an arrangement taking place a transaction is going on something is happening that we need to playay attention to amen and then we can share in it all right now you'll see in a minute why I was using that to the point but now what I want to do is I just I've been talking about the coming of the Lord and we know that it took 4,000 years for him to complete his coming and that was completed by him coming into human flesh see they're back in the beginning and I believe then it shows us the second coming of Jesus Christ is to be what we we've been talking about for quite a while as the bride coming of Christ or in other words God coming in you right that started on the day of Pentecost and uh you know will climax in the Rapture of the church because we go to meet him in the A and he does not become physically you know visibly physical right way he becomes visible in this fact of Revelation but not in the facts of you know hitting on wood showing how stle it is or anything like that because we meet him in the a so we don't want to break the scriptures and try to say well he's he's physical he say well and that's what your Prophet said that the Pentecostal people that said they had uh blood on their foreheads and and oil on their hands and all kind of things he said they don't realize that they are contrary to the scriptures because that if you have the blood you would have to have the person here that the blood was in all right so that's you know that's his point of of a good way of expressing it but now I want to do that I want to just go back and and let's just take a little run through in the Bible and just uh you know look at some things and finish it up on this part and then if you have questions we'll try to cover them Wednesday uh or any other time now as I said the coming of the Lord that's why we kept reading from Isaiah blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord that's been our thought you know all the way through now I express that to you and I won't say but just a word because I've done it on many services throughout it but not to lose some uh to me to send Wade in my name is fine but all is present is my name right the someone is having to honor me in my name and and see that's not what it was God didn't send the son to come down to take his place right all right he wouldn't be a just God to do that right see he came himself right but the way he came it did it hid it from mankind so much until they're they're not able to see it but he was standing there up on the earth and he said if you've seen me you've seen my father that's right that's that's no problem you know it's just to read the Simplicity and see if I guess probably when I was in the Baptist I was more Oneness than I was trinitarian because I would argue with people about that and most of you if you didn't know it the basic Baptist Doctrine is one God but it is expressed th as God in three persons Blessed Trinity which is just trinitarian it's like anything else but when as I tell you when brother Mo said that to me one day he said what do you see about God I said one true and living God he said explain it I said God and three person Blessed Trinity cuz that's all the words I had he said you're as much Trinity as they are I said explain it sir he said well a person's a personality personality is an individual individual is a person yeah he said well you got treated like everybody else I looked at him it didn't take me no 6 months it didn't take a whole you know rig of marar I didn't have to go home and study about it I looked at and said I don't believe that no more right I didn't I didn't believe that anymore that was in D that took care of the problem with that now I didn't know how to explain it but it did take care of them three persons I could see that much all right but now see the coming of the Lord actually started way before the foundation of the world Amen that's right because God in his mind he had uh you know as he was D as Elohim the self-existing one right and that would do away with trinitarianism but but he was there as the self-existing one but he had in his mind thoughts he wanted to be a savior he wanted to be a Healer he wanted to be a redeemer he wanted to have a family right amen all right so he started a form of showing what he was going to do he goes through the creation of the world and I spent many years ago I spent months preaching out of the Book of Revelation on the the de the days of creation the six and taking each one you know to show what it was doing but what it was doing was showing that God wanted to become visible amen he's never wanted to be self-existing he wants to exist with his family right right but he had to bring his family into being right all right so he starts out and showing a beautiful picture of what he wants because he brings a world he brings all of the things down and he's the the word Lo the word logos or speech is used back there in Genesis and and even your scholar Scofield he shows you that the Son of God was the word of God that come out of God in the beginning right I mean the scholars know that because they they but then turn around and make a Trinity out of it because see see it was not his day and time but yet see as it was that the we look at it as one two three persons or whatever the persons or whatever I talked with a man one day about it and he said well I see it now I see it there's not three Gods I said hey I'm glad you see it he said yeah there's just two he said there's a father and a son oh my I said well we talked long enough to got rid of one of them let's just talk a while see if we get rid of one more and get you right but I wasn't making lot of him CU I came through that I knew right where he's at but now you think about it see that God in his mind he wanted all of these things to take place right but he had to to in that form of knowing he also knew that if he created you and I and he put us on a free moral agency that we would fall amen if he didn't know that he not God so what are you talking about a peanut brain God or something this don't understand as much as you understand you know that's the way the kids are and all the kids think you understand more than your mom and daddy well that's the way as humans are we think we know more about things than God does but just now keeping mind so in his in his creation he began to express himself and then he last he created man and he created him first in a spiritual being and and said now in the let us make man in our own likeness and all and as he created in a spiritual man see then that spiritual man was in the garden to control the animals and things but still God was lonely because that was not the finish of his desires because he could not be a Healer there or or anything like that because there was nothing wrong but he knew as quick as he put us in flesh that we would fall well he didn't make us fall he just knew we would now if you say he didn't know that we would fall then I say you got to peanut bring God that's the best way to say it I'm sorry I'm not hateful I'm truthful you know I just talk that way at least you don't worry about what I'm saying you know what I'm saying all right but in his creation see which came first the Creator or the creation that's right so you would naturally know that the Creator came first and he started his condescending downward to reveal himself to us because that's what he wanted to do it was not just his plan to be a Healer now listen to I'm point to be a savior to be a redeemer it was was not even just his full plan to be a father right or anything like that he wanted to come and live not just with a group of people he wanted to come and live in a group of people it's always been the plan you say well how you know cuz that's what he done in Genesis cuz he took that part of him you got to admit in Genesis 1 there where it said let us make man that when he made that man that was a spiritual man but Genesis 2 then he made the natural man that's right all right then he put the spiritual man of Genesis 1 which was eternal life your Prophet said Adam had eternal life God breed into his nostrils right but now he gave him eternal life now when the fall came he couldn't breathe eternal life into man anymore because it would make Eternal Sinners and that would not be God okay but see then when it happened then the Creator could look down and see his creation but yet still he was not capable of of of communicating exactly the way he wanted to be with that with that people see he he doesn't want to just as I said be with us you know or that we worship him right he wanted us to be a part of him or to be him made manifest amen that doesn't do away with him it's not like trying to give out his brother Mo used to explain it you know we look at it like giving out God like cutting up an apple you know you give away the pieces you run out of apple see that's not it because that would run out of God right it's not that way see the more he gives away the greater he gets right that's the understanding see all right now to be the Creator now I'm making some points so Point okay when I say I make a point there I better listen my point is that in the fact that he is the creator then he would have to be there more real or be more real than what he created right is that sensible that shouldn't be any problem you know just playing language right that the one who created would have to be create greater than the creation so as he did then I'm wanting you to keep this in mind because he then would be present right in each stage if you brought him down you know and you bring him as Elohim and he's self-existing you try to draw it out in a picture and then you see another step forward maybe coming towards man and you seeing word logos Etc and then you see him speak and see if you draw all of that out just remember it's the same person but this is the way we think we think he stepped down and there's a hole back there and he stepped in another stage and there's another hole you know that's you know I know what brother randam says and I believe it he said all God was and he said all means all but see preachers take that and they just all and all and all and all all all all they just keep going well you better remember what you doing if all God was he poured into Christ there's no more God and if all Christ was he pours into the church it's no more Christ right so you're right in the devil's trap that's trying to get you to believe you're God right right see just because the scripture will tell you in him dwelt the fullness of the godhead bodily and we believe that that's what's to be revealed here right but the prophet said he give us a message of cheer down through the endless ages in eternity all right so then there's more of God to learn in eternity so we better get our little words right yeah all is all like I said take a glass of water pour it over to another glass pour it over another glass and you got a bunch of empty glasses so just remember God can step down here and he can be right down here with us right and him and the devil's up in heaven talking amen that's right now I don't get so spiritual see that's what everybody does they want to spiritualize inside of me is where God is at well then there's the devil in there the devil can't be in your soul at the same time God is in your soul right right all right see where your language falls apart and I know ah you're just smart it well there's one thing about it get the fix seed in the F Holy Ghost can Quicken it that's right now let's move on if we believe him to be Hebrews 138 then whatever he was he is and shall always be amen so when he was Elohim the self-existing one then he was Hebrews 13:8 right all right now wherever he moves down through to reveal himself he must still be Hebrews 13:8 right right all right so then if we believe that we have zoee God's own life surely we would believe that God had that life all right and Zoe means what it's just like say using Elohim Zoe in things means like ever present for eternity it means Hebrews 13:8 whatever he was he is and will always be we change right God don't change right that's our problem so we don't see him as being as he's condescending that each stage of his condescending whether it be the great existing Elohim or whether he makes a step downward to be the word that that means that that is the same almighty God and it means he's present so don't forget that now don't forget that he's always present am right he's an always present God am now see God begins to reveal himself now remember the psalmist we're reading blessed he that that cometh in the name of the Lord your Prophet said one day blessed is he that believes that God has comeing this amen which was the revealing of the word through him amen all right see brother randam wanted us to see God is real no Prophet ever spoke of a God in heaven right now brother D got scripture where it says when J said Scot in heav you're not listening that's it that's words of expression Moses said God is not up in heaven that one should go there he's not over the sea that one should go there he couldn't Express the whole point of his sin of what he was talking about so Paul picks it up and he says what he's not in thee not thee in thy mouth in thy heart the word of faith that we preach God had a burning bush for Moses to stand in front of right right and he met God personally we talk about it and that one for 5 minutes in the presence the prophet said of the pillar of fire meant more than all the 40 Years of his mother telling him that he was to be the deliverer of Israel because it was something personal right he told him there at the burning bush he said go down to Egypt and get my people he said I'm not going he said go get my people he said well who am I going to tell them sent me he said tell them about the God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob he said listen I know about Abraham I know about Isaac I know about Jacob I know there was a god there but that's not going to I'm not going to Egypt getting my head cut off right I try to paraphrase things you get to listen at it but when he said listen I am that I am right I'm ready to go go to Egypt why cuz he had something for himself right right that was real no Prophet ever spoke of a god somewhere else he spoke even as though he was that God Amen that's right that's why the language and the wording sometime they're actually speaking look at the psalmist they pierce my hands and my feet right yeah so much caught up in the spirit of God until it just like he was going through a great crucifixion think about that I'm sure he's sitting out there sweating and screaming in a holling running all over the place cuz he could almost feel the pain it was so real but see God has always wanted us to see that he was real amen that's right God has always wanted us to see that he's with us amen I know I speak funny I'm sorry but just I don't have no education to explain what I talk about so I just have to explain to where I can right a god up in heaven is no good come on you're no more than a totem pole come on right now brother D I'll have you to understand if you don't have a present god with you what kind of a god do you have you might as well get you an idle put it in your pocket and carry it with you oh oh no I believe in a living God where's he at he's up in heaven well there's not a religion in the world that doesn't believe in some form of afterlife or some form of a heaven or whatever the words may be different glory land you know on the old endan was looking for the promised land to come you know and all of the things yeah happy hunting ground but see Church my point is one thing if we are a creation of God and that's your if not M then he's always here he was back there I loved that today I heard the prophet say that in all of the problems that Israel had s him 10 times before they ever got him out of Egypt just a little piece you know when they got over to kades Baria he was still ready to take them into the promised land they'd send not send time for but when they didn't believe that he was able to do it he said you go out there until you get this thing straightened out and come back here believing I can do it right what was he wanting them to believe that he was with them right is that not what he would tell who was it to uh Gideon that had so many of doing and they took him out and had him to do certain things and he said because there's too many of you right you'll think you're doing it got it down to a few hundred and he said now we can do it right go and Conquer a whole nation with a handful of people right why because he said to who was it to Moses or Joshua said when you hear the going in the mbery bush Joshua he said you get ready to go I'm going before you you know what when they got there A lot of times they come to find out the Hornets should just took over and run them out they a have to fight see it was because they believed in the present tense God right if you don't believe in the present tense God I w't talk to you out of service because I certainly do I believe in one that's real not up in heaven come on but he's here we've always you heard how many times you I made this statement that we have spent 6,000 years trying to prove there's a God up in heaven and God has spent 6,000 years trying to prove he's down here now how many times have you heard that all right write it down you might want remember that all but now listen Abraham Isaac Jacob Joseph how long could we go with each one of those as to Abraham actually meeting God right and he fed him communion right how about Moses that had seen God in so many ways but then one day he said Lord and there's only about 10 verses different from when he was seeing God through all of the great things are in the scripture but he turned around and he says Lord I'd like to see you yes amen I just like to see you he said go hide in the cliff to the rock where he' smoked the rock to get the water out of you know go go stick your head in the cliff to the Rock and I'll go by cuz you can't see my face and live he saw the back of him that was the Lord Jesus Christ right amen right cuz that was who it was amen get what I'm talking about God came down to the people of the Old Testament to show himself as being present amen the battle is not yours he would say it is mine amen was it Gideon that took the the lamps and the things and went up you know and they broke the lamps and man they just man just wipe out a whole nation just by busting a few little lamps around you know because the battle was the Lord's it's always been that way but one day see that God of the creation took upon himself the form of his own creation and created a body that he might live in right amen now don't you think that he could say I am here you want scripture Les you believe that I am here don't you unless you believe that I am he right amen you'll die in your sins unless you believe that I'm real let you believe that I'm him but all in his life you remember the thank the quotes we gave the other day where that brother Ram said that Jesus spoke more of his second coming right you know than he did of anything else in his life there see because he was talking about it you know the kingdom to come I must go away this must happen I must give my life that's got to be all of the things he was speaking of those things but he was telling the people don't be afraid I'll go away but the comforter will come well he's going to send somebody else he said no I and my father will come and take up our abat in you that's right in other words going to be with you the same word with is in John to where it says and the Word was with God same word with is the same form that he is using to speak to you and I about the new birth on the day of Pentecost God came down to fulfill all of the things and started his second coming which would be the baptism of the Holy Ghost coming to Quicken the word that the people had held right right and bringing the people and making it ready for a time that he could live in mankind which would be greater fulfillment now listen don't don't think that God started out with something great I remember seeing a movie one time and a man was explaining oh I'd have Lov been back there to seen him open to the Dead Sea I'd have love to seen him when he done you know that's our mind I I I'd love been back out when brother Brandon was here well thank God we got some Among Us it was that's wonderful but I like the Bible blessed are your eyes that they don't see but you believe it right all right right but you see he was talking about his going away and he said I'm going to go away and I'm going to come back and I'm going to start a new creation am a new race of people y I'm going to come and live in you and that's going to be my second coming the bride coming of Christ the prophet calls it coming out of the church so all the way down through the church ages it's been those candlesticks we were talking about this this morning and God revealing himself in Bride form down in the church ages as the son of man now listen in the church ages they didn't understand son of man Paul never wrote of it Peter never wrote of it John wrote what Jesus said about it but no comments of his own about the son of man because they couldn't understand that because that's what Jesus done when he said to Peter that day he said who do Man say I the son of man am right Peter said thou the Christ the son of the Living God right he said Flesh and Blood didn't reveal that but my Father revealed it unto you paraphrased it put in our language and on that I'll be my church I'll come and be in the church and live in the church but said in the end time I'll come back and explain the son of man because you got to have the son of man back in the end time because you can't go to the Millennium without him that's right you got to fulfill that all right now then in the bride coming of Christ where would it be then like I said about Moses he said God is not up in heaven God is not over there God is here well show me the writings of any of the Apostles that put God anywhere else Paul picked it up and said God is not open in heaven God's Not Over the Sea God's not the in mouth the word of faith that we preach right now show me any of the Apostles contrary to what Paul said about that see on the day of Pentecost he become present tense he was D mark this down 2,000 years ago a man Rose and the message went out that he is risen and it took 2,000 years to preach that right right yeah what will be the message in the end time cuz I wouldn't have one it made the statement we'll get to Wednesday I'm not going to today but we'll get to it Wednesday your prophet of God said that God and his church would unite in the last days to bring the message well what do you mean brother Brown brought it that's wonderful come on but has it been revealed to you that's right amen okay we'll get to that see he said I'll never leave you he said I've got to go away and there's going to be a little Gap here but said don't worry about it I'll be back but are we like Joseph and Mary that thought Jesus was in their midst but you know he never left them see we blame him for going away from them and they did too you know your father and I have sought you diligently right well now if I had a child now come on women if you had a baby and that baby was Immaculate Conception and it was God in human flesh and you told everybody about that where would you expect that God to be if you lose him I go to church looking for him wouldn't you I sure wouldn't look at him for The Honky talks and all of the Slime I'd head right back to where he supposed to be right instead of that they went in the slums no you say you don't know well you don't either so don't worry about it they went somewhere looking for him for three days right and then after a while they finally doned on them hey we were the last time we were there and the last time we seen was in the temple like I said about the songs of Solomon he loved his Vineyard read it sometime why didn't that little woman go out in the vineyard and sit down and wait on Solomon to come n she went out in the highways and the hedges and saying if you see my love tell him I'm looking for it she'd went where she was supposed to go right into that Garden or was where he was at the whole time that's what I'm trying to get get you to see God's never left us he never left Joseph and Mary he was right exactly where he was supposed to be and if listen if they were good Christians where would they have been right right okay now now listen why can't we believe then that in the end time that God would send us a prophet send us a man to be able to express and now you show me brother brandom ever talking about a god up in heaven so that's what caught me when I first started reading the thing that caught me about him to make to know that he was a prophet I was we Witnesses with brother George and brother uh Thomas back there they were there and they was telling us about it Joyce was a little bit too young and little then to tell him much about it but you know these others told us about Charlotte to is still too young to be able to tell me about that but you know they could tell about uh seeing God in a man seeing the dead raised the sick healed well that's wonderful but you know you can make up stories about anything right when brother Mo began to tell me about the healings and the signs and the Wonders I said brother Mo you tell me what the man taught and if he was a prophet I'll know by what he Tau sure he said I'm glad you said it that way so be he began to express the things the prophet had taught us and when he did I knew for certainty that he he had to be in contact with God right cuz he's greater than anything else and he could make it so simple but he never did Brother Brown never did talk about a god somewhere else the way we talk see this is the way we when I'm doing pretty good God's with me but when I ain't doing too good he ain't with me now show me that in the Bible bless I want it out of the scriptures and out of the prophet's message he don't leave you you leave him right don't ever think God left me S sa right come on God never left SA all left God why cuz he went down to the witch of indor to find out what was going on even in all the bad he done if he just stayed away from stuff like that I told you about the time we were going to send some money some brothers wanted us to help some of them in the Philippines and this brother had said something to me and I was over there and he mentioned something to me this other brother said if I was you I'd got to watch it he didn't say nothing else and he didn't know about what was going on either I decided well I better back off maybe and uh so I found out through secondary ways that the man was taking the money that was giving him and buying up a bunch of goats and you know what he was doing with them they were sacrificing them to the idols to try to get favor with the gods I'm not joking you just happened right it's because they were trying to find all of the gold it's the Japanese they know there's a bunch of gold left on on in the Philippines that the Japanese had this carbox loads of gold and they're still looking for a lot of it but see they were going to sacrifice in other words that's what he wanted money from me was to buy goats to be able to sacrifice to a go to some kind of a idol to get it and I'm glad I didn't have much to do with it cuz I didn't didn't think about that I thought of what brother randam said he said I could have told them where that oil well was at he said I could have told him he said but they doing it for the wrong thing he said they missed it they got closed he said but somebody else that was a worldly person come in and hit a gusher cuz they drilled right where he knew where the go the oil was at but listen Church what are you talking about we had had a man coming in the come in the last days that never spoke of a god up in heaven he spoke of a God that was right with us right he spoke of a living reality of God that no man had ever preached like it and he would even stand there and he'd say if I have told you the truth then let him come where did he ever fail that's right God would always step on the scene at the man's voice a great reality here's something I told you to write down how many wrote this down you remember the message that we preached on a couple of services like the appearing and the coming do you even remember the messages I hope you at least the titles but you remember what I said then what did I say I said if you'll notice that brother brandham always used the word appearing and coming in the same phrase statement up until 1962 he used the word appearing and coming after 62 sure but he never used them together expressing that there's a difference in his appearing and his coming you remember I told you to write that down that I get back to it later you know well you know when I make him statements I make them hoping you write it down or when I get back to it it won't be a blank I didn't remember you saying it but see there's a reason because see brother brandham up until that time he had in his mind exactly what scripture was that there is appearing and coming and that there's two different things he's appearing and then he's coming he can appear out here in organize religion save the people heal the people but that's not his coming right right there's a difference in appearing and coming you see after 62 or especially after the opening of the seals show me brother brand I'm talking about something that was coming or something about appearing sure he would say the Lord's coming don't misunderstand me right he would say the Lord is coming yes we're looking for his coming but then he turned right around and tell you the Lord's here right like all of the prophets of the Bible he never spoke of a god coming he spoke of a God that was here right right now listen in 1982 in 79 I preached the seals 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and I had a place there I couldn't cross over it was something I couldn't understand I know it got to be me to understand it okay and I waited but in 1982 God showed what I needed and I preached the seals again in ' 82 and 83 and on that seventh seal I said the seventh seal is his coming Brother Gary could probably give you the tape number and the the dates on it cuz he used to listen to him as well but you see I saw what the coming of the Lord was 82 yeah 82 83 I saw that what I had preached in 1969 that the Bride of Jesus Christ would be the son of man amen the word made manifest upon earth right first sermon I preached in Athens Georgia 1969 and until this day I don't have to change any of that because what I saw there in the opening of the seventh seal I didn't see God out under coming this way because that's not the word I told you the other day keep close attention to when your Prophet is talking and he'll say the seven seal is the coming of the Lord and that's what he been he's been coming for 2,000 years right see we're looking at it no it's going to be out here somewhere and when it does he'll come you know well you still got you to to doot to doot in the trumpets and the sound and all of the horns right what you see when I saw what the coming of the Lord is I didn't see him off somewhere else and you don't face a Doctrine Upon A Dream but I told a dream can you remember it I was dreaming about the coming of the Lord and in the dream it says it's reproduction I got up I didn't look up the word reproduction I knew what that meant to produce again sensible you know what word I looked up the word e n d e n d cuz brother brandham said the seventh seal is is the end of all things is that a direct quote seventh seal is the end of all things that's right all right and I knew my dream was spiritual so well how' you know that because see when something is the word end and I wish I could find the channel and and I will one day I'll get it all down get my dictionaries and I'll find it for you because the word e n d means to reproduce right no in means like the platform there and you just stepped off of it or the wall that's the end you know that's what you think the word end doesn't mean that in biblical terminologies when something is reproduced you have brought it to an end cuz it's not going to be a reproduction of the reproduction right right right when something comes to an end it's reproduced right when Jesus Christ comes in his bride the way he was here in mortal flesh outside of the body of human flesh that he in Jesus thank you but becomes visible Among Us that is the end of all things come that's right it all be brought to an end thank you Jesus but are we like Israel was of old that Moses God told Moses he said at the burning bush he said you go get my people did you bring them out here and said I'm going to come down in front of all of them and show your right show that I spoke to you I'll become visable among you well you know that's what happened right Moses told him God told me to go get you and take you out we're going out to to that same Mountain I was in and God is going to show you what I said is true because he's going to come down where you can see him y well what happened right when they got out there with a mountain on fire like I've told you over and over and over and over one more time Moses had one burning bush whole Mountain was on fire every Israelite had a bush all they had to do is get in front of it and talk to God well there well you tell me what it is but before they got there they had sinned like everything that's right and what was their statement oh they were afraid you mean the god of creation is coming down into your presence and you're afraid come on folks now they wern't afraid of the Mountain of burning and it falling down on them because they could stand back farther enough to look at it you know two or three miles if they needed to you know probably not with binoculars but they did have a lot of things back then but they wern't afraid that the mountain was going to fall on them they were afraid of the god in the mountain amen and they didn't see that God personal because Moses was afraid when the burning bush and went up but it doesn't say about Moses that he was so scared to death and he just shaking and oh Lord what no no no he was standing in a holy reverence a fear yes but a holy reever fear in front of a living God brother Brandon said when his presence comes he said you're afraid they said what about that angel brother brandom why don't you ask him his name he said you don't talk when he's there right it's a holy reverence holy fear right is not a scared shaking in your boot heals what you heal just like I tried to explain here not too long long ago there when Jesus he was asleep and they woke him up the Bible said they were afraid right they was afraid and they woke him up aren't you afraid we're going to drown he just turned around walked over and set his foot up me he said peace be still now read your Bible Mark 4 and 41 read it they became exceedingly fearful what the waves was done the boat was Cal no because they seen who was in the boat with them why is the presence of God to be something that would make us afraid right the main reason is because it we're Sinners that's right but just remember one thing he got in the boat with them they didn't force him to get in that boat and ride with them I love what the prophets I said while ago said when the Jehovah the Old Testament had come down I didn't get to the Finish point he come down and he just busied himself like a father all the things that was taking place you remember old bam and B you know and trying to get him to curse him said look right here at the back Park look at all the bad things they're doing the prophet of God looked down and said I'm looking through God's eyes and I can't see nothing that they're doing amen I only see the shout of the king in the camp that's right but you see we don't actually believe what the New Birth really is Right Jesus said Matthew 28:20 we go to 2819 we love that about the baptisms but what about 20 where I am with you all didn't say always all even until the end of the Earth right brother Dale is there any way for us to stand in the presence of God yes through the atonement that was made that he made it was an advocate for you and I as Sinners or you think you're sinless I'm sinless in Christ amen I'm not sinless in myself come on I'm sinless in Christ he don't see me he's looking at the blood come on thank you Lord I'm going to start preaching some messages pretty quick once I finish this a little further and you're going to think that brother Dale has sure backslid on his preaching bless you better remember a statement of made I've preached a many of things over again right brother Gary but all always when I preach it again it goes a little higher right I'd write that down it'll go a little higher each step right but it may be so simple like this I won't even have nothing but just a a topic to go on I want you to see that God is real Amen in life now just for one minute how many over all of these years has heard me try to explain this is 198 through2 that I was explaining what the word come is you ever looked it up coming is a word of travel but it says in in psalmist he that cometh cometh means to be there the word come means to be here I say to brother Mark I said brother Mark come to see me all right now he's got to get to where I'm at for that can be fulfilled right right cuz if not he's in travel but once he stands in my presence then what I said about come to see me now it's real the word come means to be here now for 2,000 years we've been preaching he is risen right now why can't we start preaching he's here now you come and show me anywhere in my whole Ministry from from the beginning until this day that that's not been my thought right I've always preached about a living reality of a living God right why because I saw God and I'm tried to explain it to you where' you see that brother Dale right here in the word amen right when it says it was with God then I know that that's not two people the way I love it is the way your brother your Prophet said he said the godhead is not complete without you amen amen Hallelujah I see people just pass over those statements they don't underline them they just it just right through the mind you know it's gone well he said he not complete without you thank you Lord he chose it that way I never chose him you didn't need he chose you well if he chose well that just means i' going to live like the devil cuz I he chose me not you got a misconception a mixed up mind a perverted Satan's place but to be just human beings and to realize that there's none of us worthy of God standing in our presence whatsoever that's right the prophet of God said on the Hebrew Book he said I'd hate to think that I was born five minutes ago yeah and how to stand in front of a living God with some merits that I would have he said cuz I born in sin shaping in iniquity spouse my mother's wound a liar right but when he said come unto me all you that labor and heavy lab and I'll give you rest right he says come boldly Before the Throne amen well bless God he owes it to me I'll go that's what the kids say you brought me into the world yeah you take care of me I can I can take you out of the world is that what you want no I'll call a def facts or what it did no I'm talking about God's here folks I'm not talking about a god up in heaven since I saw that in the prophet's message when I seen it come in this message I'm never preached to God in heaven how many remembers this statement 30 years ago probably I said I'm quitting trying to go to heaven I'm trying to preach God is here and many remers that statement God is here he's not somewhere H even if you don't have the new birth he's right there with you talking to you right trying to help you you know if you're going down the road and the car starts the wheel starts spinning and you uh you know what you call it hydroplaning on the everything and you're you're fixing to run into something you don't have time to stop and say wait just a minute now hold it I got to pray brother said Joshua did not have time to pray he said but he realized he was prayed through before the foundation of the world that's I've told this over and over about it but it's true we were driving Tom's big van one time not a little one it's a bigger regular van that he was driving and we were going up to irvan Tennessee and some of you were in the car I'm sure and uh it was on the old what call Sam's Gap Road and Sam's Gap Road is not the one you're going up now Sam's Gap is one of those kind where you read the tail light the tag number your car twist to much and it just goes right there this up and down right a lot of you have been there cuz we've been over it many times and here come a tractor trailer in one of those curves and a big old sheer wall right beside of us just like this just the the old white line on the side was maybe a foot 2T from The Rock she wall and we come into that curve and there come a tractor trailer the tractor was in our side of the road so where was the trailer com to be the tractor was over the center line into her Lane and just like that we went out the other side Tom looked at me and he said how did you do that I said Tom the same way I get a serving you better learn to trust him amen Amen brother this ain't no push button thing that you got to go through two or three secretaries to get to God up in heaven cuz he's not up there that's right amen he's here yes sir come on he is here hallelujah he is here am he is here holy I will bless his name again he is here Len closely here him calling out your name he is here you can touch him you will get it in now but I don't I can't start nothing off anyway let's try let's try see anybody have a need he is here hallelujah he is not in heaven he is Holy I will bless his name again our sister wants a couple friend can we believe it father in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we give these to our sister believing that whatever she's asking for is a finished Propet and she just needs to walk there him and receive it we love you we thank you in Jesus name anybody else I will bless your name why because he's here he said do you feel his presence you never fail the presence of God I felt it so real until I'd look around to try to where you at he wasn't out somewhere he's R in here but times he comes down in a special anointing let you know that all is well we send this par God believe in you that you'll take care of this because your children has we love you and we thank you in Jesus name this anybody else if you want to see him turn around look look at the people around you God is here will again he's prci he him call your he is here you can touch you see people have said to me said brother Dale how can you be like you are to stand up and preach and to stand before all of the people of this message some of you been in places that we were in to were that I had to stand and take a stand but how do you how can you do that not because I'm stubborn I'm I'm a whole lot smarter than that but because God said he would be with me we were going to a ministers meeting one night going to leave the next day and it was going to be on a certain thing on marriage and divorce and I would back in probably that corner praying and there's always one scripture worried me about it and I thought Lord be with us in the meeting we're going to have because they were coming in 20 30 preachers and some big ones big names were going to be there said I know these things are going to be brought up this scripture right here has always bothered me we there in Deuteronomy where it says that if a man finds some fault and his wife put her away she goes to be another man's wife and all the that and the other and it looks like it's saying it's okay for her to do it I said Lord I know that's wrong speak to my heart he said that means that she is going to do it doesn't mean it's okay I'm not okay and it to be done we go on to the ministers meet and still didn't know got up it was my time to speak once you got through speaking they had questions and answers for hours whatever it took and I was up there speaking and this man brought up that scripture and this man was a theologian he was a Greek scholar a theologian I'm not kidding I won't call his name he brought that scripture up and I looked right back at him as a brother with him brought it up I looked back at the brother I said now brother you're standing here where I was I was standing there and I said that can't be what that man says cuz that would mean God is okay in prostitution and that won't work he just got real quiet and wouldn't say nothing I said brother you're going to have to make a statement I said now is that man right that it's okay in prostitution or am I right about what I say that that is not what God is saying he's not saying she can he's saying she will do it he sat there for a moment I said brother what do you say is he right or am I right he shook his head to in verification I said it's on tight that the brother shaking his head to show that that man's wrong but what I'm saying is right well see I how do you think I felt I knew who was standing there not me but I was in contact with somebody that had the answer and I wasn't afraid he never it's just been there Robie can tell you about the time that some people threatened us with a min4 rifle then where we was at I just look looked at the man I said fell what are you doing what are you talking about said you're on our land I said no we're on government land

run right into where the old man was and the boy said let people down there on that land he turned around looked behind heci said then that's him you know when I left there I had permission to hunt on that man's land because I wasn't being sarcastic nor arrogant I told him we were trying to follow the truth that we we was a church but you see fright no no cuz when he's there I'm not afraid and see
