brother Mike comes and ministers for us Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord Open the Eyes of My Heart I want to see you why I want to see Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord Open the Eyes my heart I want to sing I want to see you to see you high and lifted up shining in the light of your [Music] glory pour out your power and love as we sing Holy Holy Holy I LIF shining in the light of your glory pour out your power and love as we sing Holy Holy Holy you Lord amen amen holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy I want to see you amen amen praise the Lord thank you well it's good to be here again amen and uh we was here last Saturday for the last wave goodbye to brother Samuel and uh I think the first time I met brother Samuel he had come down with brother Moz to brother Do's Church in Augusta Georgia y'all may be seated for just a moment and uh it was a n 18 73 I think so 71 was when the assembly here the church started what did it start on July the 4th or okay and uh so that's been 53 years ago so a lot of water under the bridge and brother Moes you know he served the church Faithfully while he was amen ministering and and then brother Samuel come in behind them and they both had similar uh Ministries being brother Samuel was kind of coming up under brother Moz not that we're just uh uh just repeating one another but uh some times you have teaching Ministries that that kind of they they come together amen and so then this church has been under a Teaching Ministry for a long time I remember one time I don't know if it was it probably wasn't you I think you was probably out in the world at the time making your uh Footprints you know and uh it's not where you've been it's where you are that counts but I think brother Dale had or Samuel uh had been preaching on the seals and uh back in those days it was on cassettes so I thought well somebody gave me some some tapes on it it was a whole box and that wasn't all probably first or second seal you know yeah they say that you know and whenever he uh I think it's been said plow a field he plows every corner of it and when you come in behind them there ain't much left to plow and so I thought 53 years of Teaching Ministry and now brother Wade Dale taking up the chip off his daddy's block from here up up in heaven not brother Samuel but the Lord Jesus Christ and also a a chip off of his daddy's uh side as it was I don't like to say block you know that be indicated you Blockhead but I wouldn't want say that I had to say that because he when you get back here and you're trying to be serious he's you know you have a difficult time trying to meditate let me say that but uh it was a pleasure and an honor to know brother Samuel and his dedication and uh he he he wasn't one for just Fly by Night things you know it's kind of like Peter said I think it's first Peter or second Peter 1 and10 he said make your calling an election sure amen now your calling an election by nature is sure because God don't do something haphazardly amen so it's sure but but God wants you to be sure and and that's where the Teaching Ministry comes in the Evangelist of course catches the the individual and brings them under condemnation not by emotions but by the Holy Spirit true con uh conviction and then he he's I find it when you get when you get saved and born again you don't really know what happens you just know something happen change your life something real it's like I've said about the Holy Ghost the baptism of the Holy Ghost is is not so much of a birth understanding wise it's an event in your life that takes place but then when you start going to church you begin to look back and learn what happened and that's the anchor the anchor is not emotion right it's not a date it's not even when you your life changed somebody could convince you that it just religious motivation uh look at the Buddhists and how their lives change and then you start comparing your life you've got to find that experienced here in the scriptures that's right you have to make your calling election sure and if there ever was a time on this planet that people need to make their calling an election sure that's including your experience it's including the message it's now amen that's why we find that the Teaching Ministry is in uh uh prevalence it it's it's in the it's at the top yeah they Heap to themselves teachers not pastors not evangelists and this is the age that that God sent a a word prophit and then the ministry coming under that is influenced by that amen abely because this this you take your GPS this is the GPS age it where God lifted a prophet up into that watchman's Tower yes he did and he could look back and see where we were see where we're going and where we are this is the only age Luther couldn't do that Wesley couldn't do that so this is this is God's GPS age that he is opened up his word and lifted us up in the tower of the Watchman Amen in one voice one Lord one God Amen uh and we're right at the threshold so this this assembly has been been well taught yes sir I believe and brother Dale I believe is is is just as true as any person can be all we can do is is what God has allotted us to do with all of our hearts amen it's not a game it's not a business it's not some kind of right metal or identification and and you are not brother Dale's sheep come on I hate to say that it's true but he said brother Dale he said feed my sheep that's right so you're bought and paid for but God chooses who he wants to feed his sheep and it's important yes it is because if you get local weed or something that's right oh yeah crazy so uh it's been it's been a journey and we're still in this journey and I I thought about brother Samuel you know sometimes the enemy thinks because he take somebody that he's done got a victory but death was stripped at Calvary that's right and and God don't worry about whether you die or whether you live he doesn't worry about how much time is left in brother Wade's Life Time doesn't he's got everything under control and and so then that's where we have to we have to put our trust in him we honor God's servants yes sir and we can sit and listen to services that they've preached but he's a present God a present help in the day of trouble he's not up there on a cloud he's not over in the grave someplace brother brother Samuel's not even there righten I read his message to us he said he said don't cry he said I'm not here amen he said you can stand at the grave but I'm not here that's right he ain't there he's up there waiting on you and I with anticipation so I just pray the Lord would give us something this evening to speak on and I uh consider a privilege and honor to be here with brother Chris also and you other brothers uh it's always bad when you call somebody's name out you leave somebody out and I'm the world's worst for remembering names I remember faces and now I've got 81 years and memory is not really as good as it used to be I have to go through the alphabet two or three times before I can remember a name and then what I'm going through the alphabet about the second time Janet's going through it about the second time you don't found it yet no not yet where are you at I'm on S oh well I'm just on D it's it's amazing how it can uh jar the the memory but it's an honor to to be here in this assembly with you people children of God the purchase of God's blood you're more important than if we had a v they digging up artifacts trying to prove David was here trying to prove Saul was here trying to prove Jesus was here and and you know if they came with a charger of of that blood that that you could have stood there at Calvary and it could have run all over you we can pour it on you it wouldn't have done a bit of good so we're we're not we're not looking for some kind of a token like that no we're looking for a living Goden a living token a living people A peculiar people strange OD ball John said they didn't know him and they won't know you that's right because you're hid in Christ sometimes you oh I'm hid in Christ but sometimes it's not always a blessing because people look at you and you look like some kind of a foreign object because you're hid from them in Christ but there's somebody out there looking for the light of a candle and when they And when they see you yes listen it's not anything in you that they would admire but it's God letting them see something in you of him that will light the candle in their hearts and open up the eyes right of their hearts that they might see Christ amen not just see him but see him high and lifted up in the position that he's supposed to be in in his word today yes and the bride of Christ is the only one that can yes sir lead people to them amen we've got tapes but God doesn't deal with monuments he has living monuments living people Living Voices not perfect people but perfect in Christ and we're moving forward and I believe that our name our days here on this Earth is is very shortly coming to a climax and it's going to be the greatest victory since Calvary because death will be swallowed up in Victory death Was Defeated we're not waiting for it to be defeated it's The Last Enemy to be put under the feet of the Bride of Jesus Christ that's right brother and we're we're on the verge of that yes we are and it will take Faith to manifest that amen amen so let's stand if we will this evening and I'd like to read from uh Isaiah chapter 53 I had just a really difficult time uh this week and uh and today just trying to uh find find U I call it finding the channel and uh and I had so many different things on my mind told brother Chris I said brother Chris I said come on I just going to have to bring a salad and and then he said yeah word salad I said yeah that's right word salad and then he can bring the entree and kind of get everything put back together get all the lettuce back in the bowl and the Tom tomatoes and things and and he'll probably throw a little meat in there with it right so we're looking for God to really really move that's right God bless you Sister Peggy yeah you're not all alone that's right amen right you can't be alone because of the resurrected Christ amen and then the family that God has given you amen in Christ I'm so glad I'm a part of the family of God we we we have our we have our loved ones we have our loved ones but we can only go so far with them but when we're together with one another fellowshipping we can soar up into the heavens we can let our hair hang down and really reveal what's in our heart without worrying about a reproach that's good so we just want to be at Liberty this evening in Isaiah 53 verse one who hath believed our report and that word uh report actually translates message because if somebody gives you a report or giving you a message about something that's right so who has believed our report who has believed our message and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed amen and that word arm actually means power it doesn't it's not talking about an appendage come on so these two it's not two different questions they're they're connected that's right because without qualifying on the first one you won't qualify on the second one they're built together who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed let's bow our heads Heavenly Father we just thank you this evening for your mercies and Grace pray that you uh would be with uh the Wade family and all the all of the family through marriage and and it's a difficult time especially for sister Peggy may you just uplift her Lord with your strength and encourage her Lord in her spirit and Lord May the May the life of her soul overflow her spirit and body and bring it under subjection to the joy of the Lord not the joy of man and woman but the joy of the Lord that she has a husband that's waiting for her beyond the curtain of time that through the blood of Christ has made a way for an eternal Union to take place again and we're we're looking for that in our own lives for loved ones that's gone on before us and Lord it seems like the list is getting longer and longer it almost seems that in my generation there's more cross than there is that's waiting on this side but we're looking for the grand reunion when the dead shall rise in Christ and those that remain alive she will be joined with them changed in a moment and a twinkling of an eye and rise to meet our king of glory we're looking for that time so tonight Lord strengthen us speak to US Open the Eyes of our hearts Lord and shine a beam of light upon our path and may we walk in light as you are light for we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen you may be seated so uh as I was saying it just uh a lot of uh thoughts and I I I determine that there's nothing I can preach tonight that hasn't already been preached like I said the the field has been plowed yeah and there's probably not anything I can say tonight that I haven't said before after 81 years of life and uh started ministering 76 so then that's a a lot of a lot of Easter a lot of Christmases a lot of a lot of funerals a lot of weddings uh lot of dedications amen and you know you look back over your notes over the years and you're preaching exactly the same thing different titles but and sometimes the titles are the same yeah but I find that even though it's the same sermon the same words it's in a it's in a deeper cycle or a higher cycle because you look at your your Bibles and the message books you read when you was a year old two years old 5 years old in the message and you look at it now and the highlights are in different places you know I like looking back over my messages and just skimming through the highlights yeah but if you pick up a book that you haven't marked and you start reading it you'll find you be marking it in different places some of them are the same but but we're in a wherein Paul said when I was a child I spake as a child and he wasn't talking about foolishness he was talking about you and I in our natural lives and how that we have matured and so there's things you know that we used to think when we were young and we don't think that way anymore and life has become more serious uh responsibility has become more serious and so then uh we don't want to stay back in our childhood it's nice to look back in the pictures when you was little and and how good looking that you was and now how you kind of seemed like the mirrors kind of changed on you somehow you you know inside you're the same young person but outside your body's just not cooperating and uh but we don't want to go back and live all that over again and there was a lot of mistakes you wished you could go go back and redo some things but listen we we weren't built to go back in time like that right it's good to study history it's good to go back in the Old Testament all of the New Testament came out of the Old Testament Paul Peter John quoting those scriptures back there pulling out those Mysteries and bringing them up into a modern day setting absolutely bringing and and beaming light down Peter said said you know prophecy he said it's like a light in a dark place sir so in a in a room that's dark and you turn on the light and you say say we have a power failure and you say okay now I've got this this uh flash side up here and I hope the batter is working yeah now everybody I'm going to shine the light on the door because some of you are visitors and you don't know where it's at it's it's a total blackout so when I turn that light on you pay attention and take a look it's a beam of light that shows you the way you get on an airplane they say okay look down to your seats amen now if we have a power failure he said the lights will come on and show you the way that's right so Peter said am prophecy is like a light a beam yes sir shining in a dark place that's right it's Illuminating it may not illuminate the whole room but it's Illuminating what you're looking that and it opens up the eyes of your heart he said I pray the spirit of Illumination will illuminate your understanding illuminate your eyes you know the older you get it seems like it's either too much light or not enough light so they talk about the eye dimming and so it actually does that it's not gathering in the light like it used to and it's not seeing all the detail but in Christ there is an illumination of the eye of the heart that you can see clearly and so when prophecy is opened up it's like a beam of light shining down into a dark place Amen to give us understanding of what's taking place where to walk amen and we must be in the way we not can't be in the ditch we got to be in that way it's a Highway of Holiness and and that's where God wants us and it's amazing it just doesn't say walk in the light as he shines the light walk in the light as he is light I quoted it that way a lot of times but walk in the light as he is in the light so he is in the light showing you the way so it's very important to know him amen because you might walk with somebody else says they know the way and you might be walking with them and and you're off on the wrong trail somewhere like Pilgrim he always had to come back he never cut across the field to get back on the road he had to come back to the place where he left Christ where he left that road and then he continued on the journey always have to come back repent come back to where you left him and then and then go on like brother Brown said about that Soldier where did you leave him and he said he thought for a minute he said now I lay me down to sleep and I pray the Lord my soul to keep as a young man he had left him but listen he he was an old man now he was a matured man but he came right back to where he left him right there at Calvary not just a child's prayer but now an adult crying crying for repentance crying for forgiveness crying for the for the grace of God to come down because he was fixing a cross over and God gave him that opportunity to come back you know many people don't want to come back they don't want to admit uh defeat down this road that they've taken that's right but you have to admit I'm lost you have to admit defeat and you have to come back to that road and finish the journey on that road that God has set for us there's no other way right brother so in this scripture we find it says who has believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed this is the scripture brother brandom used in God and simplicity and so he's actually warning the people especially all the theologians Y because when it's going to be over that they're going to say yeah what happened what I mean I already knew all that I thought this was really going to but they but they missed it amen you go back and study Revelation 5 yes sir and he says he said now he said uh God is this is the this is the breach it's the tie Block it's bringing the seals and the church ages here he said we're setting a scene we're setting a panoramic for what's fixing to take place when those seals are going to be open he said if you miss this he said you're going to miss the seals there's nothing in there about church agent I mean there's nothing in there about horse riders it's all on Redemption right and he and he's tying the church ages he said now the church ages is what took place that was the Antichrist but he said now the seals is is going to tell you about Redemption how he did it so it's not moving on to another time that that time is the opening of that information but it's actually going back and it's running in parallel the seals especially the first four seals are running in parallel it's it's coming together so then if if I don't understand you know a lot of times when we first come in we'd skip over the over the God and simplicity yeah I want to get to the seals what is this this is a breach yeah I I got to get past this thing but see they they missed the warning yes because he said something's fixing to happen and you ain't going to see it on because this God God is unrecognized and so that's what we're we're looking at this evening or trying to is that God is not always noticed when he comes on the scene I I thought about the woman at the well she comes up to Christ there's no anointing there's no Aurora lights or anything and hair don't stand up on the back of her neck it's just a man walking up to anybody that's here and I thought you know he was the Messiah the whole time he was God in human flesh the whole time and yet she didn't even she didn't know him the only thing she knew was yeah uh a Jew and here I am a Samaritan this is strange this guy's talking to me you know and and so then just in the in the conversation under the ministry of Christ absolutely don't ever let somebody tell you it doesn't make any difference what church you go to brother absolutely matters yeah because uh a church a minister can only preach from the rims of his experience abely Paul's letter they say was only the explanation of his experience and as his experience deepened his his letters deepened that's right right so he was preaching out of the rims of his experience now there was things he talked about he didn't experience like the Rapture but his gospel was an explanation of of his experience so then you know some people's experiences they may have had a true experience but they've misinterpreted it through emotions or some kind of Dynamics or something and it's not word-based uh I don't know who would have ever had a uh a more Dynamic um a visitation than Paul right yeah and I I thought the other day I always thought that was Jesus talking to Paul but it wasn't it was the Holy Ghost talking to him right because he said why pers Ute you me so who was the me it's the holy ghost in the people and here the Holy Spirit now had embodied himself in a pillar of fire and was speaking to Paul the holy spirit that was in the church is now in a pillar of fire and still in the church he ain't vacated nothing yet and yet he's talking to Paul on the road and Paul God had designed him a certain way listen he was a 180° out of sequence he was going the wrong way but what was motivating him was the seed that was down in him it was the love for God he committed his whole life as a young man went down there to Jerusalem from up there where he was at Tarsus his daddy sent him down there he went down there a young man and trained up under those and he was a Pharisee of Pharisees he excelled in Zeal in understanding and knowledge and why did he Excel because he was had such an IQ no because he loved God and he was trying to find that righteousness in order to please him and to serve him better and and he tried and he tried his whole life was driven uh just like David except he was he was he was under the wrong ministry right that's right and he was he was being pushed from that seed that was Within in but listen when he met him on the road there was no question then but then he went and he went back on the back side of the desert to make his calling an election sure amen and he wanted to know oh why did he come why did Messiah come why did he die why did he resurrect he wanted to know these things he wanted he wanted Christianity to have a reasonable gospel not a Dogma right and so on the back side of the desert uh the Holy Spirit Come and and opened up the Old Testament to Paul he said it was a new book to him listen he knew it from cover to cover he he could quote any any Scripture you could say a scripture he could finish it but now it was a new book what happened listen it's the same book yes it is it it wasn't it wasn't a new revised version but now he was looking at it with anointed eyes with a holy spirit that was taking him down just like Jesus Took the disciples right and he took he brought all the scriptures of the law of the prophets and the Psalms that spoke of him oh what a what a bible school that would have been what a Bible study that was and in such a short time to cover all that am listen he didn't mix in and mince a bunch of extra words and Flowery things he brought it right down laser sharp right to those scriptures and he took Paul on the back side of the desert and gave him the Saints of three and a half years right exactly right he he was only a few hours with the disciples right Y and he said I've already told you all this this is nothing new right but I'm telling you now because it's the anointed time there's things we preach we preach down Through the Ages but it was at a certain layer right yes amen but listen we're getting to the final layer and and there's things that you understand as adults that you didn't understand as a child as a teenager you understand these things now you might not be able to explain everything but there's a deeper understanding of what life is listen from where I stand like brother Walker said years ago he said from where I stand brother Michael he said I can see the Finish L and listen death is getting more real but you know what the fear that I had as a Young Man the fear is not there it's not something that you embrace it's not something that you want it's not something that you enjoy it's not a journey that you're looking forward to brother Bram said it wasn't made to be beautiful right it's only something like horses to take you into the presence of God because everything that God gives us everything that God gives you and me is by faith I thought about those I thought about those Jewish people that Israel standing there at the Red Sea and they looked out there and there was the enemy they was afraid of the enemy yes sir and they were coming to wipe him out and here come this Pillar of Fire amen and then that sea opened up I remember looking at that movie there Ten Commandments and that wall of water and all that noise and the wind blowing he said okay now just walk down through there there's your escape with every Temptation he makes a way of Escape he takes you right through that that's right and listen you look down through there they ain't never done that before and you walk in there looking at that water and all that it took Faith yes it did amen everything that God gives us it it takes Faith to accept it and to walk in thaten am so this it says who has believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed so brother Brenham says he said they that believe the report I want to say not just believe the report but that the report is revealed to them right right you know Romans 5 says that we have access sir to Grace did you know that you had to have access to that you did it's out there for all the world but you know it's kind of like the resurrection there was many that saw the resurrection but there were a few benefactors right they saw it they witnessed it they could tell you all about it but they didn't draw any benefits from it no and so then he that the report has been revealed to and so Romans 5 if you go and read it it says we have access to this grace through faith that's right so Grace is sitting there but it takes Faith to benefit from that to have access to that and that's a gift to God it's not something that you did in Bible school so who has believed the message who has believed the report who has believed God's word amen and he that it's been revealed to yeah yes then the power of God has been revealed right amen you say well that's that's pretty simple it is but you know when when they came to Kadesh Barda they all heard the message didn't they yes amen right amen and I'm sure that they couldn't but help have to believe certain amounts of it sure yeah but when they got to kades Barda there was a problem yes sir only two people had recognized and had known the power of God right y right that's what we're looking at tonight we're I believe we're coming to another Crossroads yes sir yes sir we're coming to another dispensation change I believe that when we come to the Rapture the resurrection of the Dead I believe it's a dispensational change we came down through the church ages it was son of God y right come 63 the rejection of the ministry of the Son of God it was a crucifixion and a resurrection of the son of man believe that 1963 it was a changing dispensation that's right he said what he did on the day of Pentecost he was going to do again in the evening time so he said when they when the the third life messenger come the Holy Spirit and begin to pour out gifts they said this is it but listen they was only looking at the surface they really didn't know God no that's right uh you can know the acts of God but you don't know God's ways and there's a lot of difference that's right you know to know God Amen yes sir I was going to read that scripture uh over in St John 17 first three verses yes sir he said this is eternal life that you know the father right and whom he has sent that's right so then the nature or the characteristic of eternal life is to know that's right etern eternal life is just not loving your neighbor but the characteristic of eternal life he said this is eternal life you know you want to know if you have eternal life is to know the father and to know Jesus whom he has sent so if you know who he has sent today you know that's right that's eternal life to recognize who he has sent today Amen to believe the message to believe God's message the Lord shall Des send with a shout Revelation 101 a mighty Angel descended with a loud voice same scripture amen over here in in first uh Thessalonians over here in Revelation 10 amen yes and we see the same scene and he's got he's got a message yes he it's a shout he said it's a message to get the people together listen to believe the message is to have the power of God revealed to you I'm not talking about Pentecostal power that's a power power of Divine Healing that's not what I'm talking about I'm talking about recognizing the power of God today that was sent to Rapture a bride to prepare her heart and there's a message involved and there's a revealing of the presence of God the power of God at Katie's bardia they didn't have that they they came and and they they looked at the enemy they looked at the circumstances they knew the acts of God but they didn't know the way of God that's right but Joshua and Caleb the message was revealed to them not in the wilderness no come on down there in Goan amen when they were down there they caught a revelation and they followed that Revelation right and when they got to kades Barda the power of God had been revealed they said uh their defenses have gone uh their their weapons that's gone God has given us this land why because they had known God in an in inate way now God didn't talk to them lip to ear like he did Moses but you know what intimacy is intimacy he says I don't call you servant not anymore I call you friend that's that's going into a more intimate relationship from being a servant to being uh a friend he said because I haven't held back any information from you right so the intimate intimacy of God is is manifested through Revelation how much Revelation he reveals to you that's intimacy look at Enoch back there all those years he was looking for God the scripture says in Hebrews 11 Enoch was seeking God we're talking about looking for God many people seeking God they're seeking light uh some are seeking an education they're going to Bible college going to Seminary those things is all right but many times it takes you away from the original experience and The Thirst that you had to know him and then you're knowing more about him and half the information you're getting isn't coming from Heaven it's coming from a human knowledge and understanding through Theology and it's only taking you further away from God it's only muffling the voice of God Amen and you're hearing the voice of men but to know him is eternal life to to know to to have the message revealed and it opens up the eyes of your heart to his power [Music] amen the power that comes to the seed yes that quickens that seed amen amen and brings life to that seed that power that came on the day of Pentecost was life yes the power of this body is life yeah when the spirit leaves this body how much can it pick up can it bat an ey can it say can it communicate it can't do anything right same body same cells everything's the same but the spirit is left so the spirit is the life is the power of that body it permeates every cell it's something that's hard to wrap our minds around if you think about it in in depth y right but when it leaves then that spirit is the life is the strength the power of that body and what the spirit is to the body is what the holy spirit is to the soul exactly and when and when that Pillar of Fire came down on the day of Pentecost that was power it gave life to the soul and that Soul became a person it became a child of God up until that time it was a seed laying in the womb seed but listen that seed wasn't dormant no no no to be dormant means there's there's no intellect there's no nothing there but brother Brenham said you remember when you was out there in the world and he was a little different yeah there was an influence but it wasn't in control that little seed was divine in origin it was actually Divine in substance yes but it was not it was in itself it was eternal but it wasn't eternal life no but when the Holy Spirit came right brother amen then life came and you became you became eternal life amen and that began to war with the spirit oh yeah amen uh the old husband now has been put away and now you got a new headship right that's right amen and you begin to talk different y you begin to uh hang out with people in different places you'd never been before you you had fellowship with people that you wouldn't have uh wanted across the street and be identified with him now you was glad you were proud to be identified with him you used to kind of shun away from religious people you know maybe have a a good cultured religion a good cultured Church where when you went in the neighborhood oh I see you go to the first so and so church and then you know but but then to be a believer where do you go oh oh my goodness what's the name of that church again you know because it's an unrecognized name amen but to know him Amen in the power of his resurrection so in Psalms 103 and verse 6 it says it says that that God made his made his ways known to Moses and his acts to the children of Israel so the Noah's Act is to know the actions of God right to to see people healed see the dead raised see the discernments all those things see yes sir but to know his ways to know the motive that laid behind the action to know them in an intimacy listen we can read books about people know everything they do know their favorite color know their favorite food and like the little Canary while he's going to come in he's going to throw his hat over there he's going to sit over there in the chair he's going to get a cup of coffee he's going to take his shoes off his wife's going to bring in the slippers and he's going to put them on and the other little Canary sitting there and he's saying here he comes oh he threw his hat over there wow you smart and he went over there and got in a chair he's got a cup of coffee took his shoes off got his slippers on and so then the Master of the House walks up to the little Canary and says hey how you doing little Canary and he goes because he is a canary brain that's he don't understand human language right we can see we can understand but to know him Paul said that I might be found in the righteousness of God Amen you know the righteousness of God gives you access to something yes it does because he says that to have the righteousness of God not to be found in my righteousness but the righteousness which is of god originates with God not with man man has nothing to do and it's by faith and he said that I might know him yes so then righteousness gives you access Paul knew that look at his experience he he said that I might know him in the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his suffering what is the power of his resurrection we're not talking about Pentecost right brother The Eyes Of Your Heart Right to know him amen believe his word because it's been revealed to you opens up your eyes to the arm of God to the power then when you come to kades Barda it it there's no fear you're not looking at the enemy you're looking at him his power look at the power that God has he's the only Power all other powers are delegated by himen he's the only one true life amen he not a form of life God is not a form of life we got human life that's a form of life but God was life praise the Lord right and God didn't send us a Founder he sent a prophet amen right a Founder is a is the embodiment of knowledge and he has disciples Christ Christ is the seed of Christianity he don't have disciples that's right come on he has Offspring yeah amen that's right because one seed brings fourth seed that's Offspring that's children that's right he didn't send us a book of knowledge he didn't send us a man that could tell us all these things and yet he did but he came to introduce us to Christ he he came El easier to call a bride there's been a bride in every age but this is the final age this is the Capstone age the Capstone of the of the elect of God coming into a bride you talk about intimacy this is the most intimate age all that was in the mind of God is now in the heart of the believer that's that's intimacy you know when you're intimate you try to find uh information about somebody you go to the wife because if the wife knows nobody knows the husband like the wife does that's the that's the ultimate uh intimacy the children they know a lot but they've never had that relationship they don't have that claim uh they're not in that dispensation and yet they can tell you a lot yeah sure uh my children can tell you what I like what I don't like but now to share my my thoughts with my wife you know think now honey he told me not to tell anybody but I'm telling you because I know you won't tell nobody and you and me we won you know and he tells his bride he opened up those seals he did every mystery that's allotted for us there might be Mysteries yet to come in the Millennium that's not important right now what we need is the is the Mysteries look at Deuteronomy 29 a moment Deuteronomy 29 and verse two come on yes Deuteronomy 29 verse 2 praise the Lord and Moses called onto all Israel and said unto them ye have seen all that the Lord did before your eyes in the land of Egypt onto Pharaoh and unto all his servants yes and unto all his land now we're talking about the acts of God now we're talk talking about the way of God right you can be in church a long time and see Miracles see a lot of things he said you've seen these things but you know seeing those things eating that Mana you know that that was a that was a great experience eating food that God had created not something that was made down here and put together on the Earth by the miraculous but he created it in heaven right and then sent it down and they ate it everything that they needed uh for nutritional value for the body to be healthy the immune system and everything was in that was in that bread everything amen and Corruption was in that bread yes it was when he designed it he designed it to where it would corrupt you tell me any bakery that makes bread and Designs it to mold not unless they're trying to get you to spend a bunch of money but mostly they're trying to put preservatives in there but he did it here was bread that came down from heaven and everything that you needed for nutritional value was in there yes you didn't need any other supplements no no other pills water sure you needed water sunlight and other those other elements but as far as food that's all you needed that's what that's what you needed was that Mana but in there he also designed it to where it would that it would uh it would spoil right get worms and go bad now remember it's divine in origin you would think that anything that is divine in origin Orin would be Eternal the body of Jesus Christ was divine in origin it was spoken to existence and yet death was in it wrinkles was in it and yet it was divine in origin but itself wasn't Divine Right amen and the bread the Mana it wasn't Divine and he designed it that way for a purpose amen yes sir he designed the body of Christ that way that where he could be a sacrifice amen somebody that's Eternal and can't die right that don't ever get any oil you know death can't touch him he couldn't be a sacrifice he had to feel pain God couldn't feel pain God really don't have a lot of emotions he only speaks through the emotions of humans so that you could understand him amen he said it repented God God repented for something he did and he never makes mistakes then how could he repent and never make a mistake but he he expressed it that way to where you could understand right but when he came down in Christ he had emotions he cried he had pain he had friends yes he he had enemies but he didn't have hatred so it said that he he experienced all those things where he could be a high priest a mediator for you and I God couldn't he could he could be a mediator but not a true mediator he couldn't sympathize with us he never felt that he never experienced it but he did in Christ amen yes sir yeah amen and he designed he designed that body to where it would die that he could give his life amen but you know he really when he came into the world because he was spoken to his existence he didn't have a sinful body because he didn't come through sex so he really didn't have the death penalty on him if he had wanted to step right on up death didn't have a hold on him but he became sin not sinful became sin amen that Mana was designed that way and it came to a time that Jesus had to tell the people said listen Moses didn't give you that information Moses didn't give you that Mana God gave you the Mana now somehow they had twisted this thing around where it came from Moses because they they looked to Moses but they they they elevated Moses above measure come on but listen that Mana wouldn't do you any good without the instructions from Moses right amen come on God gave him the instructions to where you could draw benefits from the Mana he told you when you could get it when you couldn't get it he told you how much to get how much not to get he told you when to save it and when not to save it and sometimes people get frustrated they want a book of rules now wait a minute you said get enough for every day now you're telling us to get enough for today and tomorrow you done change the rules he said I'm just telling you what God Said right and the Mana came that it might humble them in other words bring them under obedience to God right right and to teach them that man shall live by every word that proceedeth from the mouth of God because if they didn't pay their mind to Moses and they say well he ain't nothing God gave us this he's just a bystander but listen he had the instructions and without the instructions you couldn't properly depend upon that Mana because you didn't know how it was going to treat you it didn't know if it was going to be there or not there and he laid it out and told you because it came from God so Moses had a place into that yeah brother brandom has a place listen the Revelation didn't come from brother brandom he was a conduit it came through him it came through him to you and me amen but listen he had a part in it he had to bring it to us amen right yes sir God can speak the language of Chinese or a Kian he can right God has doesn't have any barriers no sir not a one but like they rejected Moses they rejected brother brandham right exactly because it didn't come their way it wasn't the way they planned it so look so in Deuteronomy 29 here it says they saw all these things they saw the acts of God keep that in mind because Hebrews over in Hebrews 3 it said that the fathers in the Wilderness they always ER and that word error means to go astray right they AED in their hearts how did they er not knowing my ways they didn't know the ways of God and it caused them to erir or to go astray yesen they left the message they left the messenger yes they aired in their hearts an evil heart because they didn't know his ways so they knew a lot about him they had had a lot of experience oh yeah listen people have a lot of experiences and then they think well we don't need this one and we don't need that one I'm good at I'm Island on to my own or my four and no more little Minister groups and things yes listen it's the body of Christ it's it's just not special fellowships it's not just feeding off of one another we're supposed to feed off of Christ we're supposed to feed off of the anointed word the the holy spirit is the feeder of the word he uses human vessels that's right you know who the first missionaries were come on the church it wasn't the apostles acts the 8th chapter and the church was scattered abroad and they went everywhere preaching the word and churches grew up here and there because the SK the seed had been scattered and they didn't bring forth church members they brought forth off Spring right yes so then if he writes a book of Acts again listen it ain't going to be everybody that's out here ministers missionarying it's going to be the body of Christ because the seed has come to maturity when that seed comes to maturity amen the the life comes up up through the stalk the life is embodied in that stock yep but it don't have a life of its own no I cut that stock off and stick it out there and plant it what's it going to do die but when but when that life comes up through there we was looking at some corn coming up here fields of corn and it was all green at the top and the ears were up there looked like it was getting pretty close to being harvested I got to notice and down there at the bottom it was turning brown I said There It Is that seed is calling for the life because when that seed when that life gets up into that seed and it gets matured y you know what happens come the B the body spits it out because it has a life of its own amen that's why this assembly is still here that's why you're still here because in you is a seed you have a life of your own but it's part of a body it's part of God but listen that seed can bring forth you know we as as men and women you know some people don't believe that anymore but I still believe in men and women you know yes I hate I hate to think what movies are going to be like in the future somewhere Lord I don't know what a mess come on brother not that I like movies but you know what I'm saying we're so used to the hero and the heroine and you know the White Horse and the white white uniform and the white hat you know and and the little Affair and all those things now I don't know what you're going to have you're going to have a mess yeah they won't even after a while they won't know the difference between the horse and a human yeah right because their mind is rottening it it's deteriorating I believe that I'm just glad we're still in our right Minds that's right so look what he says here the great the great Temptation which thine eyes have seen and that means tests trials eyes have seen the signs those great Miracles yet the Lord has not given you see now the Lord has not given you a heart to perceive or to understand in other words the eyes of their heart right is veiled no light in there they can't perceive right I eyes to see and ears to hear unto this day I have led you 40 years in the wilderness your clothes are not wax and old upon you thy shoes are not wax and old upon thy foot every one of them it wasn't just the Believers now everybody's lumped in here together they've all had the same experiences Dayan and Cory they could look at their shoes right they look at their clothes they ate the Mana they they drank the water from the rock they sent under Moses's ministry right even though they couldn't stand it they were like the 70 they said we can't stand this we can't I don't want to listen to this no more we're out of here amen and yet they were a witness to it just think about it people don't like your preaching don't like my preaching don't like yours you other ministers in here they don't like your preaching listen 70 out of uh 82 of the church members didn't like the pastors preaching that's right that's that's pretty good percent that's right they got up and walked out you read it in the Amplified they didn't want to hear that no more they tired of hearing that all this mess about eating bread and eating my flesh and this and that we ain't going no we ain't going that route and then right in the middle of that would you like to belong to a church now say this is the church brother Dale comes up here brother Wade your first name should have been brother Dale I can't I can't ever you know it it just yeah well I know to that one yeah well what can I say but when I say brother Dale I think that's your first name and it ain't then I have to say brother Wade brother Wade Dale sounds right but uh this world 20 years ago I could have never imagined that America would be in the condition that it's in right yes in verse six you have not eaten bread neither have you drunk drunk wine or strong drink that you might know that I am the Lord your God now there there's the ways yes and here's the acts they knew all the acts of God they had participated in all the meetings but when it came to kades Barda the power of God had not been revealed to them they didn't know the way of God because God had not opened up their hearts to perceive amen the woman at the well she says I perceive now where did that come from it sure didn't come from Sunday school now some of the information came from Sunday school she realized by the teaching of the Pharisees what Messiah was to do what a prophet did she done heard enough about Isaiah and Moses and all the teaching she went to Sunday school she went to church with her mom and dad but she was looking for something yeah yes sir Luther was looking for something yes sir Paul was looking for something and they searched with Agony yes you searched you say well I really didn't search yes you did that you down in the side of you it was searching the Deep cth to the Deep Paul said this seed y you take that seed that you buy in the store and I don't know how old it is you can put it up in the pantry and keep it a a year or two and take it and that seed I've always said it's it's crying for water it's crying for sun yeah and and you say well I don't think so I didn't hear it you said I wasn't looking for God that woman at the well wasn't looking for God that's what her problem was she was looking for him but she didn't know where to find him job said if I could behind him yeah that's right amen he said if I knew where his seat was if I knew where his throne was every seed of God is crying out to God it's looking it's looking for that place to come to where the light can strike it amen that it can be what it's supposed to be amen you take that seed you say well it's not doing that you put it down the ground and you put some water in it and see what happens God predestinated you by his for knowledge now his for knowledge didn't look down through the tunnel of time and and seeing brother Dale come to church and backslid and went out and came back and said oh I'm going to predestinate him to be a preacher no that's based on merits right and Grace is not based on Merit it has nothing to do with what you are it's who you are down on the inside Grace tells you you why you got saved Faith tells you how you got saved but God knew he'd have so many children he knew exactly how many children he knew what body they'd be born in so he predestinated an event in your life yes sir he didn't predestinate you the seed was already there that's right but he predestinated an event it that the sunlight and the water amen the water of the Holy ho Spirit the water of God that's right that fountain that floweth from within it it came and watered the seed somebody testified you read your Bible you read a book you listened to a message I don't care how it come God orchestrated that's right an event he made sure he did that you was going to get your inheritance we're coming to adoption they were coming to adoption but they didn't know him no no they didn't they didn't believe the message they they intellectually that's right but look when they came to kades Barda Hope and Faith Hope and Faith were coming to a Crossroads Hope and Faith agreed you believe the message yes I believe the message Hope believes the word right hope believes in God hope hopes for it faith has it faith is the substance of things hoped for right but some never knew him right and so they never got past hope so they came up to kades bardia Crossroads and they said they said we believe the promise and they had Fellowship they had communion right up until they came to kades Barda but now something happened information came that discouraged hope it said that Abraham hoped against hope in other words there was no qualification for hope it was contrary to Hope but now his Hope was beginning to turn into Faith amen and so now hope began to sound like Faith yeah oh yeah until that he said he considered not the weakness of his body being not weak in faith that's right and faith is the substance of things hoped for amen right remember we preached on Sarah and he came he came to the tent he says well this time next year and Sarah laughed watch didn't she laugh yeah but tell me she had Faith you read Hebrews 11 it said by faith also by faith she conceived a seed that's right she didn't have any faith but then she met him she met the one that made the promise he looked at her and he said he saides you did and right then she knew who he was absolutely she believed him yes but now hope had come to Faith yeah and she believed the same her testimony was the same as as Abraham's he considered not the weakness of his body nor the deadness of her womb and she considered not the deadness of her womb nor the deadness of his body amen their their faith because they had met the guarante listen Joshua and Caleb they had met the guarante oh yeah amen they had met the one that came down amen they may not have met him like like Moses met him but they knew him yes they not only knew his acts they knew his ways they believed the report it was revealed to them down there in Goan amen and because they revealed the power of God he says right there he said I did these things why did he do those things he was trying to reveal himself to the people he said that you might know that I am the Lord your God but they didn't know no they they didn't they were non-elect no right they could come up to kades Bard and fellowship listen people can Fellowship in this message and they come up to a certain place and then they just peel off yes sir they never they never met him no they didn't right brother that's right the woman at the well met him yeah job met him glory Enoch met him look what happened to Enoch amen there he was in the church he was a Believer listen to the testimony of of Adam Adam said oh we walked with him in the cool of the evening I told you this before that's what I believe and he said I believe he's the same yesterday today and forever you know he says I believe it's in Satan's Eden he said eve fell at One Promise she fell at One Promise Hebrews 138 yeah he's the same yesterday today and forever thought he' changed his mind about his word but Enoch said he's the same amen if if he walked I I thought coming up here I thought I wonder how many times he went to that Eastern Gate because they must have known uh Cain and Abel they knew that that was the place they came out and they knew that's where to bring their altars that's knew where they so he must have gone there and he must have looked saw those Flames he said man maybe he's behind there I don't know I just and and the scripture says in Hebrews 11 that they that seeketh God diligently seek him so it's talking about Enoch and remember Enoch is you Amen in this day you were seeking God you were seeking the reality of God Sarah was seeking seeking truth and here came the sign of the son of man the sign of the word and here come the sign of the word and you believe the message and you saw the power of God not brother brandom the power of God that's right in his word the word of his power that sustains everything the authority of the word the power of authority is the power of the word amen yes right amen we're coming to adoption you know why he redeemed you so you could be a Christian no that's that's true but it says he in in the fullness of time he sent his son to redeem you that you might receive the adoption of sons amen you know what that means come on receive not just become Sons no but to receive your inheritance that's right amen you can't have adoption without inheritance listen it just goes right there together we're coming to the fullness of our inheritance the manifestation of the sons of God the unveiling the sons of God have always been here right right right John says now are we the sons of God listen we're not waiting for the sons of God we're waiting for the manifestation for the veil to be taken off the fullness of the adoption right believe that brother and we're coming yes I'm I'm going to tell you I've taken already enough time good but you look at this do you know Revelation 13 the mark of the beast do you know that that's a theocracy yeah that's a a theocracy is is when that you have a government that claims to be divinely led yes uh Israel was a theocracy in the Old Testament they had the king and they had the prophet right yep and God guided the king and the people through the prophet right and the prophet was the was the ruler right right so what what is revelation 133 it's a it's a theocracy that's what Nimrod was he built a tower and a city the tower is religion the city is civil power yes so it was a union between what they call a union between church and state it was a union brother BR said those two horns was ecclesiastical power and civil power right look at Trump in 2016 I could read some things that he said that he was going to do for Christianity he did a lot of things he's unconverted right right you know now he he says America needs to needs to pray together and let me see if I can find this real quick oh my if I can't find it real quick I'm just going to leave it alone leave something on the plate yeah well you said you said a salad I'm trying to get everything out here this is 2016 Trump now when when I say Trump I want you to think about Constantine yes exactly what did Constantine do 325 years of church persecution Y and then he championed the cause of Christianity do you know what he looked like in the eyes of those Christians that have been persecuted hunted and killed and burned and just all had been done for 325 years and he says no more persecution of the Jews said wow can you believe that when he said that no more pers then they recognized Christianity as a national religion right he he was a pagan he put away the Pagan shrines and the idols and he made all the pagans come to catechism and they all had to learn about water baptism and they were exed to be baptized if they didn't capital punishment right right and he championed the cause of Christianity and he brought forth a marriage and he married paganism that's right and Christianity did and Pagan Rome became Pap Rome a theocracy right and then Rome ruled Europe for 12200 years yes sir under a theocracy yes all of Europe and then when the Reformation came the reformers they took the same path Germany became Lutheran that's right and you had to get your children sprinkled and they became Lutheran Church yes sir if you didn't bad

movement it's not a new movement Christian nationalism listen we're not we're not that far from a theocracy yes sir right brother amen and the foolish vers is crying against it right they're saying uh if you unite church and state bad news but like Noah he knew he knew the Judgment was coming yes he did but he didn't know what to do about it he knew he knew what any could preach CU his Daddy and Grandpa told him that's right yes sir and he believed the Judgment was coming he saw the church in its condition he didn't know how to get out of it he didn't know what to do right the foolish virgin has enough about her to recognize this much of the Antichrist but she really she really needs a word from the bride but it's not time you tell me how close we are I don't know whether this man's going to get in everything is so chaotic but it shows you how easy it is and how it's coming it'll look like taking up to cause of Christianity playing right into the hands of Satan Satan wants to be your Champion he'll come into the church he'll butter you up he'll he'll prolite you he'll do everything he can right except give you the word he don't want you to be liberated any man like David David was King had a house of Cedars yeah but he wanted he wanted the arc the presence of God yeah in the midst of the people yeah any Minister wants the Living God the living Christ the Holy Spirit yes sir in the center of the church amen that light amen I believe this church has that light amen praise God it's no time to buckle it's no time to fall no right brother and he can still be found yes yes sir sometimes we just need to go buy that artisian well and just get a nice fresh drink my wife come in here she say you want some water I said I don't need any water right now she said I got to have some water I got to so we went down in the kitchen and there's there that little bubble thing there you know it's got the three switches on the top you can tell the visitors yeah she says oh it's cold and refreshing but I want to tell you what it's nothing like getting a drink out of an Arian well if you've ever drank out of an artisian well or a bubbling brook coming down the mountain side it's it's pretty close y but it ain't the real thing no it ain't right and he said that he would put a fountain yes inside of each and every one of us that's right that somebody could get a cold drink sometimes they need a cold drink sister Peggy needs a little cold drink right now of Living Water not not not some kind of sympathy I'm talking about living water something that'll really put strength in you yes he can still be found yes it says he's a rewarder of those that diligently seek him now if you're seeking him he's not going to give you a bucket of gold that's right right if you're seeking him and he's going to reward you for seeking him what's he going to do he's going to reveal himself to you and many times when he does that he stands right in your way he he stood in in the woman at the well he stood in her way while why he wanted to talk to her sometimes right God wants us to stop long enough long enough where he can talk to us and when he talks to you he puts strength in you as we bow our heads let's bow our heads Lord Jesus just scattered Lord but you can take these words words and break the bread of life to your children Lord I've I've said what's on my heart maybe not all what's on our heart but Lord we never really empty out our hearts in that way but like job said oh if I just knew where he was I'd like to sit down how many times we'd like to just sit down underneath a a shade tree someplace and talk to you Abraham went outside one morning everything was going wrong it was hot lot had left and taken his his sheep with him family busted up and there he was down in the middle of trouble it was just a a hot day and everything seemed like it was going wrong and he sat down underneath that that shade tree a little breeze blowing kind of felt a little refreshing and looked up and saw three men one of them he recognized Lord won't you come sometimes we feel like that we step out of these air conditioned buildings and the heat smacks Us in the face walk over to a little shade and sometimes there's not too much relief but Lord that's when you come when we're under the junal ER Bush when we're down in the valley Lord you come you give us some meat you give us some bread you give us some food you give us some water you talk to us Lord you're still a living God you're not a cloud up there floating around amen you're the same God that spoke to to Paul on the road to Damascus you can still speak to your people in however which way that you want to whether it's in a whirlwind a pillar of fire yes you might come Lord as a man as a woman and speak to your children those that are really Desiring to hear from you I pray Lord that they seek you like Enoch did you're the same yester day today and forever you're not the figment of our imagination you're not a religious feeling you're not just some kind of a religion you're a living God calling the living people that you can have communion with us Lord and we with one another amen bless this people for their patience bless the services tomorrow and Sunday Lord may you do a may you do a work amongst your people may you use brother Chris may you use brother Dale and bless him Lord as he is stepped into this position of Shepherd of the sheep of God as Moses was keeping his father-in-law's sheep as David was keeping his father's sheep now he's keeping your sheep Lord may you bless his ministry may you give him wisdom understanding and Lord out of his experience may he minister to his people no matter what the subject is Lord may you come through him and give him spiritual food in due season and sometimes it comes in a personal way just when somebody's needing something and you'll speak right straight to them through somebody and they'll know it's you speaking it's not the it's not the veil that you're speaking through it's you yes and then there's times Lord that you'll visit your people yes Lord I pray that you strengthen them and Lord may you shine the beam of light down in our path and may we walk in light as you are light as you are in light light and may we have Fellowship one with another in this light for we ask it in the precious name of thy son Jesus Christ amen amen Amen brother praise the Lord Give the Lord another we'll sing a couple of songs if you have a need tonight the word came forth yes and I I I wrote a little note there well more than one but when he was talking about the unrecognized Christ you know only those that are in him can recognize him that's right that's why they couldn't recognize him that's right they weren't part of him no sir you can't recogniz I recognize brother Mike cuz I've been a part of his life for you know 40 years so I recognize who he is I know where he lives I know his mannerisms I know a lot of who he's married to I know who his children are why I recognize him because I'm part of him right in spiritual sense well that's the same way with us that's why the world can't recognize us the devil listen brother R said you you know you get to a place where Satan wouldn't even know what to do with you that's why you become unrecognizable to the devil you've come to a good place that's right when you come unrecognized and he's like man I don't understand this right good I hope he stays confused cuz he's confused me for long enough come on brother oh I'm just the only one come okay no he's he's confused
