[25:50] that service that sermon this morning
[25:52] was just a masterpiece I sure appreciate
[25:55] um the word of the Lord that my brother
[25:57] brought um
[26:00] [Applause]
[26:04] and uh I was kind of thinking
[26:09] you know how how sometimes oddly things
[26:11] kind of fit together but you know uh he
[26:14] was he was he was speaking about
[26:16] um this this common idea among the
[26:18] message that you come to you come with
[26:20] eternal life already in you this
[26:22] afternoon I'm going to talk about how to
[26:24] get eternal life and you know you think
[26:26] about uh how why did why would brother
[26:28] Brandon preach messages like the
[26:30] impersonation of Christianity and things
[26:31] if you come with eternal life already in
[26:34] you but now now that is that is a
[26:37] Doctrine out there people you know
[26:38] people sometimes they get a little bit
[26:39] skeptical or do you really know but
[26:42] listen I I some of the minister Brothers
[26:44] know I sat down with um some a brother I
[26:48] will say and uh you know talk to him
[26:50] first you know I I liked it I like to
[26:53] pick people out and just you know talk
[26:54] to them and and that what they believe
[26:57] is is that you come with eternal life
[27:00] already in you and the new birth is when
[27:03] you just recognize that it was already
[27:04] there now come on now
[27:08] I I remember I remember being lost I
[27:11] remember I remember when there was
[27:14] something wrong with me
[27:17] but this afternoon I want to take a
[27:19] little a little scripture from Ezekiel
[27:21] chapter 11. and just talk to you about
[27:23] the spirit of the Lord
[27:26] if you'll turn over to Ezekiel chapter
[27:28] 11 and they'll pull it up as well
[27:30] Lord God we're so grateful for the truth
[27:32] in this hour so grateful Lord for for
[27:34] men of God who will who could who can
[27:36] who can bring your truth and are not
[27:38] afraid to Proclaim it I'm so grateful
[27:40] Lord to be gathered together that this
[27:42] afternoon Lord Jesus in this place Lord
[27:43] and we're no Lord that your spirit is
[27:46] here because you promised it in your
[27:47] word that where the twos and the threes
[27:49] would be gathered that you would the
[27:51] angels of God will be attempt around
[27:52] about them Lord Jesus and so many other
[27:54] promises that we have in your word that
[27:56] if two or three would agree concerning
[27:58] anything that you would do it and so
[28:00] many promises Lord that give us comfort
[28:02] that you're with us and Lord maybe maybe
[28:05] this right now Lord as we gather
[28:07] together maybe we can't feel anything or
[28:10] see anything visible with our eyes but
[28:12] yet we know that you're with us we know
[28:14] that you're here Lord Jesus we know Lord
[28:16] God because you've sent your promises
[28:18] and you manifested them to us Lord and
[28:20] we ask Lord as as I preach these words
[28:23] Lord Jesus said it won't just be some
[28:25] kind of an intellectual something from
[28:27] my mind or from from my knowledge Lord
[28:30] Jesus or even from the listeners Lord
[28:31] from their knowledge Lord but the spirit
[28:33] of the Lord will come and Quicken it
[28:35] Lord that you'll give me utterance Lord
[28:37] Jesus that you'll open these things to
[28:39] The Listener Lord that they'll have
[28:40] understanding of what's being spoken of
[28:42] Lord
[28:43] because truly without the spirit of the
[28:45] Lord that's the only thing that can put
[28:48] things together that can put the word
[28:49] together Lord Jesus that can make it so
[28:52] that we can understand it and make it so
[28:54] that it's lived and Lord we ask Lord
[28:56] that you're just blessing out of service
[28:57] and Lord feel it Liberty to move Among
[29:00] Us this afternoon because surely Lord is
[29:02] the prayer requests have gone forth
[29:03] there's many needs Among Us Lord there's
[29:05] many need but yet Lord as thy brother
[29:07] was testifying you're here Lord God to
[29:09] make your promises real we've seen your
[29:11] healing touch Lord Jesus we've seen your
[29:13] power and move among us and you're yet
[29:15] the same today we thank you Lord Jesus
[29:18] and that's this blessing upon your word
[29:20] in your name
[29:22] and Ezekiel chapter 11 says in verse 16.
[29:27] therefore say
[29:29] thus saith the Lord God although I have
[29:31] cast them far off among the Heathen and
[29:34] although I have scattered them among the
[29:36] countries yet will I be to them as a
[29:38] little sanctuary in the countries where
[29:39] they shall come
[29:41] therefore say thus saith the Lord God
[29:44] I will either even gather you from the
[29:46] people and assemble you out of the
[29:47] country where you have been scattered
[29:49] and I will give you the land of Israel
[29:51] and they shall come thither and they
[29:53] shall take away all the detestable
[29:55] things thereof and all the Abominations
[29:57] thereof from things
[29:59] now here's the main point that I want to
[30:01] speak to you about
[30:02] and I will give them one heart
[30:04] and I will put a new spirit within you
[30:07] and I will take the Stony heart out of
[30:09] their flesh and we'll give them a heart
[30:11] of Flesh
[30:12] that they may walk in my statutes and
[30:15] keep mine ordinances
[30:16] and do them and they shall be my people
[30:19] and I will be their God you may be
[30:22] seated
[30:23] the Lord had his Blessing to the reading
[30:25] of the word
[30:26] now you think about what a great promise
[30:29] that is to be able to walk in the
[30:31] statutes of the Lord to be able to have
[30:33] understanding of what we're reading
[30:35] about and to be able to walk in this
[30:37] word
[30:38] from beginning to end
[30:40] and keep mind ordinances and do them
[30:43] there is no way to do that as we were
[30:45] speaking of just briefly in Sunday
[30:47] school there's no way to do that outside
[30:48] of the baptism of the Holy Ghost outside
[30:50] of the spirit of the Lord coming and
[30:52] quickening the word in your heart and
[30:54] making it live there's no way to keep
[30:56] his statutes now a lot of times people
[30:58] they they think that they can do it or
[31:01] or they try to they come to church and
[31:02] you know you you hear the gospel
[31:04] preaching you think well I you hear the
[31:06] things that are said I need to be a good
[31:08] person I need to be you know all these
[31:10] different things and and what that makes
[31:11] is sometimes sometimes you'll start
[31:13] acting like it and so we don't want to
[31:15] be actors and that's kind of what I'm
[31:17] gonna be speaking about this afternoon
[31:19] we want to be something genuine we don't
[31:21] want to just hear hear about the law and
[31:24] about the doings and the things that
[31:25] you've got to do about how you got to
[31:26] pay tithes and you got to do works and
[31:28] you got to do do be a good person and
[31:30] love one another and all those kind of
[31:31] things and you try to manufacture it but
[31:34] we want it to be real genuine and you
[31:36] see it it ain't going to be genuine it's
[31:37] not going to be genuine without the
[31:39] spirit of the lord we need the Holy
[31:40] Ghost to do the that but there's a
[31:41] promise in the Bible to be able to walk
[31:43] in God's statues to keep his ordinances
[31:46] and do them and to be his people
[31:49] I think I think you know as the gospel
[31:52] Goes Forth as the message Goes Forth you
[31:54] think what God is doing is he's he's
[31:56] actually drawing you through the through
[31:58] the preaching of the Gospel you can have
[31:59] access to these promises you can have
[32:02] access to they're laying there in the in
[32:04] the pages of this Bible that you can
[32:06] have access to and you hear the gospel
[32:07] being preached and it's pulling you it's
[32:09] drawing you oh you see with the gospel
[32:12] is not the gospel is not somebody
[32:13] forcing you it's not God forcing you
[32:15] through a tube it's not a minister
[32:17] forcing you to come to church it's not
[32:18] somebody grabbing you by the nape of the
[32:20] neck and dragging you to the watering
[32:22] hole and say and drink but it's what it
[32:24] is is God drawing you and God pulling
[32:26] you you this is the this is the greatest
[32:28] sales pitch of all time the greatest
[32:30] sales speech that if you're coming to me
[32:32] Jesus said come unto me all you are
[32:34] weary and I'll give you rest that I'll
[32:37] take you in Labor that Jesus is willing
[32:39] to take all of your burdens if you'll
[32:41] just yoke yourself up with him yoke
[32:43] yourself up with him and he'll carry all
[32:45] the burdens he'll pull the load for you
[32:47] he'll carry all the all the I'm talking
[32:49] about all the Strife of Life all the
[32:52] problems where you you think that God
[32:54] you think your children maybe you're
[32:56] beyond being saved cast that on God and
[32:59] let him bear that burden you think that
[33:01] your boss is being too mean for you and
[33:03] unfair with you at work if you throw
[33:04] that over on God God will take care of
[33:07] it that's the greatest sales pitch of
[33:09] all time that we got a God who wants to
[33:11] carry all of your burdens so with that
[33:13] kind of a gospel God is jaw and you he's
[33:16] pulling you he's saying come unto me
[33:17] come that that's why there's three pools
[33:21] not three pushes he's pulling you he's
[33:23] drawing you to himself he's jawing you
[33:25] into this further relationship with with
[33:27] him he's drawing you to the holy of
[33:28] holies
[33:29] he said if I'll be lifted up I'll draw
[33:32] all men unto me I'll draw I'll pull you
[33:34] I won't push you into it that's why even
[33:36] brother Brown preached that message of
[33:37] deep call into the deep that like David
[33:39] said the Deep with a deep water spouse
[33:41] and so forth as a deep that's calling
[33:43] you this jaw unto you the Lord's army is
[33:47] a army of volunteers not a army of
[33:50] voluntol but an army of people that God
[33:52] has drawn to himself and they responded
[33:54] they opened up the doors of his heart of
[33:56] their heart and so that's this afternoon
[33:58] if you've never opened up the door of
[34:00] your heart to God I invite you I implore
[34:03] you to open up and let him come in so
[34:06] that you can reap these benefits so that
[34:08] you can reap all of the promises that
[34:10] are laying here for you
[34:11] now brother Jesus said in Matthew
[34:14] chapter 4 he said he talked about
[34:17] um he said in Jesus walking by the Sea
[34:19] of Galilee saw two Brethren Simon called
[34:22] Peter and Andrew his brother casting the
[34:24] dead into the sea for they were Fishers
[34:26] and he saith unto them follow me and I
[34:28] will make you Fishers of me and now
[34:29] Peter didn't know what he was talking
[34:31] about
[34:31] but what Jesus was talking about is is
[34:34] he's going to teach him along and Along
[34:36] by and by a process he's going to
[34:38] instruct him through the baptism of the
[34:40] Holy Ghost and all the things that
[34:42] lessons of life that Peter would go
[34:43] through how to catch men now see that's
[34:46] what we're doing when we're when we're
[34:48] preaching the gospel we're throwing the
[34:49] net out and when you when you cast in it
[34:51] when you go to the to the to the ocean
[34:53] and you throw a net out you're going to
[34:54] get that's what one thing I don't like
[34:56] about fishing in the ocean is you never
[34:58] know what you're going to get back you
[35:00] pull up I've seen people pull up a big
[35:02] old eel that'll wrap around somebody's
[35:04] arm and pull up all kind of strange
[35:06] Critters and stuff
[35:07] but you know you're going to catch fish
[35:09] too you see the gospel net is going to
[35:11] come back with all kinds of things and
[35:13] and in Matthew Chapter 13 it said the
[35:15] Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a net
[35:17] that was cast into the sea and gathered
[35:19] of every kind which when it was full
[35:21] they drew to Shore and sat down and
[35:23] gathered the good in the vessels but
[35:25] cast the bad away so shall it be at the
[35:27] end of the world the Angels shall come
[35:29] forth and sever the wicked from among
[35:31] the just
[35:32] and shall cast them into the furnace of
[35:34] fire there shall be weeping and wailing
[35:36] and gnashing of teeth now brother
[35:38] Brandon when he preached the message the
[35:39] impersonation of Christianity he used
[35:41] all the examples to show that we're just
[35:43] preaching that we're just throwing the
[35:44] net out that God is going to do the
[35:46] sword God is going to do the separating
[35:49] we're just preaching the gospel and
[35:50] tossing out the net to see what comes in
[35:54] a service the service are like should we
[35:56] pull they ask Jesus should we pull
[35:58] everything up yeah pull it all up
[36:00] and Jesus told him in Matthew 13 He said
[36:03] look both grow into the Harvest
[36:05] and in the time of harvest I will say to
[36:07] the Reapers Gather ye together first the
[36:09] tares and bind them in bundles to burn
[36:11] them but gather the wheat into my barn
[36:13] God is able to sort it out God is able
[36:16] to feel Believers with the somebody
[36:18] that'll open the door to their heart to
[36:20] their heart God is able to fill them
[36:21] with the Holy Ghost God is able to sort
[36:23] out the net God is able to put it
[36:25] together
[36:26] so this afternoon I'm not I'm not here
[36:28] to pull up I'm not poor here to pull up
[36:30] the wheat and the tears I'm not here to
[36:32] pull something up but I'm here to preach
[36:33] the gospel and see who responds I'm
[36:35] issuing an invitation I miss you in an
[36:38] invitation if you'll if you'll open up
[36:39] the door of your heart God will feel it
[36:41] God will feel every fiber of your being
[36:43] with the Holy Ghost that's the promise
[36:46] that we got laying here
[36:48] and you say
[36:49] oh oh thank God for the truth thank God
[36:52] for the truth like we heard this morning
[36:53] thank God for the truth that will be
[36:55] laid out thank God thank God for the
[36:57] spirit that can Quicken that truth but
[37:00] you know we need a balance of both of
[37:01] those things I think the the church
[37:03] world has been struggling with a right
[37:06] kind of a balance for years you know
[37:08] that's one thing I was I was kind of to
[37:10] talk kind of privately with some of the
[37:12] ministers about you know you go around
[37:13] and you see that lack of balance amongst
[37:16] amongst the ministry you see and like
[37:18] like brother Louise was talking about
[37:19] this morning
[37:20] you go some places and they're they're
[37:22] so labor and heavily on the word and
[37:24] they're like let's maybe it was Ronnie
[37:26] long there's so many there's so many
[37:28] preachers preaching lately
[37:30] you you go some places and they sort of
[37:32] Labor and heavily on the word word and
[37:34] they almost they put the spirit out and
[37:36] they say well we don't need the spirit
[37:37] anymore but you got to have the spirit
[37:39] otherwise otherwise you're just going to
[37:42] be an actor otherwise you're just going
[37:43] to say well I know all all the facts so
[37:46] I'm just going to act it out I'm going
[37:47] to try within my own self to do it I'm
[37:50] gonna well I know what I'm supposed to
[37:51] do so it's late the instru I can read
[37:53] the instruction manual so I know what
[37:55] I'm supposed to be doing so I'm just
[37:57] going to try to try to try to fake it
[37:58] but you've got to have the spirit of the
[38:01] Lord you've got to have the spirit
[38:02] moving in the church you've got to have
[38:04] the spirit moving in your life and let
[38:06] me tell you I loved when you when you
[38:08] talk to some of the young people and
[38:09] they they say things like oh I feel like
[38:12] God is just separate me from the world I
[38:14] feel like God's moving that that is some
[38:17] somebody where the spirit is actually
[38:19] moving in their life and doing something
[38:21] that see God don't want us to be all
[38:23] drawed up and formal and everything well
[38:25] we know all the facts and we're trying
[38:26] to be an impersonator we're trying to be
[38:28] an actor but he wants to be a real
[38:30] genuine Holy Ghost Field Church Holy
[38:33] Ghost spilled people nah now see y'all
[38:37] sometimes sometimes it sounds like
[38:38] ministers complaining about the the the
[38:40] way that the church world is the way
[38:42] people are and the message but brother
[38:44] Brown you go back and listen to the way
[38:46] he preached the impersonation of
[38:47] Christianity
[38:49] this brother this preacher brother came
[38:52] up to him and and started having this
[38:54] conversation with him about the state of
[38:56] Christianity now listen to what he said
[38:58] brother Brown about two years ago I
[39:00] thought maybe the Lord had called me to
[39:02] the United States for work he said I
[39:04] went to the West Coast and got connected
[39:06] with a certain broadcast that goes
[39:07] National and he said well I seen the
[39:09] dishonesty of the way they misused the
[39:11] finance that was sent in he said I just
[39:13] as a Christian couldn't stay there any
[39:15] longer
[39:16] I left and I got hooked up with another
[39:18] and said it was out of the frying pan
[39:21] Into the Fire he thought he'd got out of
[39:24] that mess and he got into something
[39:25] worse and he said I then I just kept and
[39:28] found out so many things and said to
[39:30] find the weakness of the American Pulpit
[39:32] he got to a place where he did he was
[39:35] looking for something genuine he was
[39:37] looking for somebody that was really
[39:38] filled with a genuine Holy Ghost and
[39:41] brother Brown said he said I said
[39:42] brother that is true we have no middle
[39:46] class to speak here of he's talking
[39:47] about a middle ground
[39:49] a balance
[39:51] we either have the real cold and formal
[39:53] and indifferent
[39:55] real cold and informal and different you
[39:58] got you got the letter on the page and
[39:59] you just kind of get cold you feel like
[40:01] nothing is going on in church because
[40:02] your spiritual life has gotten cold and
[40:04] you you don't see anything really
[40:06] happening and you think well nothing's
[40:07] happening and so you get real cold and
[40:09] indifferent and you start thinking well
[40:10] we don't need no more Spirit of the Lord
[40:12] moving amongst us and he said or the
[40:14] extreme you get all the extreme fanatic
[40:16] on the other hand you get so far into
[40:18] the extremes that you're you you're
[40:20] running up on stage saying that that oil
[40:22] is dripping out of my hands and standing
[40:24] up in the middle of the congregation
[40:25] speaking in tongues out of order and all
[40:27] this kind of thing going into fanatical
[40:28] oh if we we need a balance
[40:31] and he said I I said it's too bad and he
[40:34] said then I come here and he said
[40:35] brother Brown as soon as I got here and
[40:37] my first message I found out it was
[40:39] beating the piano and turning over the
[40:41] chairs and he said then I began to
[40:43] wonder and he said
[40:44] through it all I tried to preach the
[40:46] gospel just in the word and when it did
[40:48] he said there was something another that
[40:50] after a while the Lord let me break
[40:51] through to the anointing and brought the
[40:54] Holy Spirit came into our midst with a
[40:56] love and a peace of God began to flow
[40:59] over the building and said then I said
[41:01] now the holy spirit is here and we will
[41:04] now Worship the Lord and concentrate Our
[41:06] Lives unto God
[41:07] and said some young boy with not enough
[41:10] wisdom to hardly get in the door runs up
[41:12] to the pulpit he said amen preacher
[41:14] that's right look oil's been dripping
[41:15] out of my hands all morning Hallelujah
[41:17] let people come up here and I'll give
[41:18] this anointed oil for healing so they
[41:20] run off into Fanatics and if you go read
[41:22] that story further he said the people in
[41:24] the church set that brother down because
[41:25] he got too carried away
[41:28] he said brother Brown I'm heading for
[41:29] Saskatoon to get out of this nest of
[41:31] evil spirits and I said that is true the
[41:34] American Social intellectual group has
[41:36] become so against the other now listen
[41:38] you you think about that this is
[41:40] happening today in the message and I'm
[41:43] not just trying to be critical it's like
[41:45] you open up your eyes go around and you
[41:46] can see it happening so social
[41:49] intellectual group is so against the
[41:51] other group and the other group is so
[41:52] against the other I tell the true the
[41:55] true middle of the road gospel is hard
[41:57] to find a place of approach it's hard to
[42:00] find a place of approach and to get a
[42:02] preeminence and down the road I said
[42:04] Lord how true that is and how hard that
[42:06] it's been to try to get the true gospel
[42:08] to the people
[42:09] pulling from both sides and trying to
[42:12] hold in the middle of the road as we've
[42:13] contended from that since the hour of
[42:15] the Cornerstone was laid see I said what
[42:17] about these Americans down here what
[42:19] will happen to them
[42:20] it seemed like something said or just
[42:22] spoke to me and said what are you doing
[42:24] what is this to thee follow thou me now
[42:28] that's a lesson I think we could all
[42:29] learn when you get to looking around at
[42:31] all the things that seem to be like
[42:32] they're going wrong you look at
[42:33] sometimes we set our eye on somebody
[42:35] that we think is really got it figured
[42:38] out and then they'll slide off and go
[42:40] off into something but if we'll keep if
[42:42] we can go past the naysayers and go past
[42:44] the critics and just keep our Eye On
[42:46] Christ and keep walking in the balance
[42:48] and what is the balance the balance is I
[42:50] need the word but I need the spirit too
[42:52] I need the word I need to know the
[42:54] fundamentals I need to know but I don't
[42:56] want to be an actor I want the spirit of
[42:58] the Living God moving in my life so that
[43:00] I ain't an actor so it's something real
[43:02] and genuine I don't want to act like I
[43:04] love somebody but I want to really love
[43:06] somebody I don't want to act like I can
[43:08] forgive you but I want to really be able
[43:10] to forgive you I don't want to act like
[43:12] I know what I'm talking about but I
[43:14] really want to have a true revelation of
[43:16] Jesus Christ
[43:18] oh there's so much faults out there
[43:20] there's so much fake out there but there
[43:22] is a real genuine baptism in the Holy
[43:24] Ghost there is a real Spirit of the
[43:27] Living God moving in the church listen
[43:29] as much as you might want to go to sleep
[43:30] this afternoon as much as you might be
[43:32] getting cold and dried up in your heart
[43:34] I'm here to declare you that there is
[43:36] still real that they're still realist
[43:38] willing to come and take over your life
[43:40] if you're willing to open him up you
[43:42] open yourself up dude
[43:44] listen now this afternoon you might not
[43:46] ever raised your hand in your life you
[43:48] might not ever clap you might not ever
[43:50] say that men but yet there's still a God
[43:52] that's drawn this the net is still being
[43:55] cast and God wants you to come to him
[43:57] he's drawing and he's cooling like that
[43:59] Dove that brother talked about he's
[44:01] drawing like that deep color through the
[44:03] Deep now you think you think about what
[44:05] Ezekiel was talking about Ezekiel back
[44:07] there when everybody was unable
[44:09] everybody was unable to receive the new
[44:12] birth he's talking about something that
[44:14] he was not able to attain and brother
[44:17] I'm liking it to uh like a prophet it
[44:19] would be lifted up over the fence up
[44:22] over up into time where he could look
[44:24] back and forward and see see the word
[44:27] that was going to be placed that was
[44:29] going to come in each age and he looked
[44:31] forward to see that one day there's
[44:33] coming to people that God God is going
[44:36] to be able to soften up their heart he's
[44:38] going to be able to take out the unclean
[44:40] Spirit he's going to be able to give his
[44:42] own Spirit into their life and they're
[44:43] going to be able to live live this
[44:46] gospel live this word that the Old
[44:48] Testament they had only grasped it in
[44:50] the Old Testament they had only pondered
[44:52] it how can I live according to the law
[44:54] this set of requirements but God has
[44:57] given us an answer in this day God has
[45:00] given the baptism in the Holy Ghost to
[45:01] us if you can only receive it
[45:04] so brother Adam said Ezekiel was
[45:06] prophesying or for telling what would
[45:08] take place in an age to come not in his
[45:10] age so God had took Ezekiel High far up
[45:14] and let him see around about 2600 years
[45:16] think of it then the word that God has
[45:19] spoken before the foundation of the
[45:21] world it isn't that God speaks and says
[45:23] something to the prophet at that time it
[45:25] is the the prophet catches what God has
[45:29] already said oh do you realize what
[45:32] you're doing here this afternoon as you
[45:33] if you receive the word you receive what
[45:36] was spoken before the foundation of the
[45:38] world like brother Louise was talking
[45:40] about this morning that God knew before
[45:41] the foundation of the world that he was
[45:43] going to come and die on the cross he
[45:45] knew that there was going to be a word
[45:46] in this age and if you receive this word
[45:49] you receive in what Ezekiel Saw but way
[45:52] back there when he got lifted up the
[45:53] pier down into this age and see that
[45:56] there would be a baptism the Holy Ghost
[45:57] for you to receive he said for the word
[46:00] was before the foundation of the world
[46:01] God spoke the word and is laying way
[46:04] outstretched out in time and the prophet
[46:07] goes up and sees the time coming the
[46:09] prophet goes up and sees the time coming
[46:11] what time he's he's looking at this time
[46:13] he's looking at the day of Pentecost
[46:16] he's looking at seven Church ages he's
[46:18] looking at you sitting here in this
[46:20] building needing something needing an
[46:22] answer from God needed something that
[46:24] God is willing to provide if you can
[46:25] just receive it it's laying way out
[46:29] stretched out in time and the prophet
[46:30] goes up and sees the time coming so it's
[46:32] only a gift of knowledge that he brings
[46:35] down and puts it on the paper now
[46:37] Ezekiel the prophet goes up
[46:39] and sees the day that we're living in
[46:42] he's looking at there's a coming there's
[46:43] coming a day when what there's going to
[46:46] be a Stony heart antidote that's going
[46:48] to be an antidote for this Tony harp oh
[46:51] maybe this morning if you've got a Stony
[46:52] heart where your heart is all dried up
[46:54] and it's it's so frozen solid there
[46:57] hardly anything your mom and daddy can't
[46:59] touch it and nobody else can touch it
[47:01] you don't want to hear nothing but yet
[47:03] there's a there's a Stony hard antidote
[47:05] that's laying here and you were in the
[47:06] word
[47:07] he said the last 2 000 years
[47:11] he had no way of entering that heart
[47:13] because it was sinful and there was only
[47:15] the atonement of blood speaking of
[47:17] ezekiel's day it was only the atonement
[47:20] of blood of an animal laying between
[47:21] that Stony heart and the Creator but
[47:23] when the Christ came and died Christ
[47:27] made a way to take that old cold Stony
[47:30] heart away
[47:32] and the weather brother around say a
[47:33] Stony heart was a Stony heart is the
[47:36] heart of man that thinks they know more
[47:39] than God does you try to witness to
[47:41] somebody and they think well I I know I
[47:43] they try to put together with their own
[47:45] intellectual reasoning and they'll talk
[47:47] you around and around in circles like
[47:49] that Indian Death March that brother
[47:51] around talked about how you know you get
[47:52] lost in the woods and around and around
[47:54] and around you go in circles they get
[47:56] stuck in a loop a Stony heart is
[47:58] somebody that's indifferent you can tell
[48:00] them you're going to be lost and going
[48:02] to hell with that Stony heart is frozen
[48:03] they they don't care
[48:06] but you see you see what the gospel does
[48:08] the gospel of prick that Stony heart and
[48:10] begin to soften it up that Stony heart
[48:12] the heart of the world where you love
[48:14] the things of the world because the love
[48:15] of the father is not even in you so you
[48:17] love you love going out and drinking
[48:19] alcohol and you love smoking that weed
[48:21] you love all those kind of things you
[48:22] love and what it is you're you're a
[48:25] hypocrite you're a hypocrite an actor
[48:27] because you're trying you're trying to
[48:29] do what you think is right and you're
[48:30] just faking it like the Pharisees
[48:33] that come to Jesus and say good Master
[48:35] we would see a sign from thee to prove
[48:37] that you are what you said talk about
[48:38] good Master they they didn't think he
[48:40] was a good Master they didn't think he
[48:42] was good anything and Jesus knew what
[48:43] they were thinking about him all they
[48:45] did they come act trying to act
[48:46] something out
[48:48] brother Rhino said sometimes God can
[48:50] deal with an animal who can't act for
[48:51] itself before he can get to a Stony
[48:54] heart who is on a free moral agency
[48:57] sometimes God can deal with a dog or an
[48:59] animal because he can speak to the birds
[49:01] and tell him you need to migrate this is
[49:03] a time of migration my wife was telling
[49:05] me this is this weekend I think was a
[49:07] big migratory pattern where all these
[49:09] birds are supposed to migrate
[49:11] she likes Birds a lot and so God can
[49:13] just move on those birds and they'll
[49:15] obey him but you talk about you try to
[49:18] talk to somebody that's got a Stony
[49:19] heart and they don't want to hear it a a
[49:21] a cow or will move away from the fence
[49:24] When A hurricane's coming but somebody
[49:26] with a Stony heart you just can't get
[49:28] through to him but the spirit of the
[49:30] Living God can
[49:32] let me preach you a little bit this is
[49:34] why I love what brother Aaron was
[49:35] talking about Wednesday night you get
[49:37] you get desperate parents and you begin
[49:39] to pray for your children and the spirit
[49:41] of the Living God can begin to do
[49:43] something listen I I know I know
[49:46] sometimes we're not supposed to testify
[49:47] when we're preaching but let me break a
[49:49] few rules here one night I got desperate
[49:51] and I began to call out to God and I
[49:54] begin to pray I was praying for Zach
[49:55] this was back when he was not living
[49:57] right and I was praying for God and I
[50:00] began to break through and I felt like
[50:01] that God was beginning to speak through
[50:03] me and it wasn't 30 minutes after I had
[50:06] finished praying and Zach stumbled
[50:08] through the bedroom door and said I need
[50:10] the Holy Ghost and listen I think
[50:13] sometimes you don't realize what power
[50:15] you've got if you get desperate and
[50:17] begin to call out to God something will
[50:20] begin to move do you realize what power
[50:22] is laying in your lips why Christ speak
[50:25] it's time for the church to speak
[50:27] I can't tell you how many times when you
[50:30] get desperate and you begin to call upon
[50:32] God and God begins to move and the steel
[50:34] of the night when you get into your
[50:36] prayer chamber along with God and you
[50:38] begin to move into an atmosphere it's
[50:40] not you praying but it's God speaking
[50:42] God will move on the scene let me
[50:45] encourage you this afternoon Church
[50:47] encourage you not to rely on others but
[50:49] to rely on your own faith in the Living
[50:51] God to know that God has given you
[50:54] something and you can use it he's given
[50:56] his word into your mouth he's giving you
[50:57] his word in your lips and you have the
[51:00] ability to put it to work
[51:03] brother mom said people's got so
[51:05] cold-hearted they can't even shed a tear
[51:07] no more they just become so indifferent
[51:09] it's the spirit of the age we're at the
[51:12] end time when men's Hearts failing
[51:14] perplexed a Time natural affection is
[51:16] gone from people the love of God seems
[51:19] to pull away all
[51:20] I I wonder sometimes if I could just
[51:23] take a picture and share with you what I
[51:24] see while I'm preaching sometimes up
[51:26] here you'll see you'll see young people
[51:27] with tears coming down out of their eyes
[51:30] you see people with it that moved by the
[51:32] spirit and then you'll see others
[51:34] whether whether they just look like
[51:35] they're unmoved they don't really care
[51:37] what they're preaching and they begin to
[51:38] slowly fall into Slumber and head leans
[51:41] up against the wall and they don't
[51:42] really care but yeah see that is being
[51:46] cast I don't care what's in the net all
[51:49] all I care about is preaching the gospel
[51:51] somebody's gonna respond and God's after
[51:54] the feast God's after those rainbow
[51:55] trout that are going to respond to the
[51:58] gospel call
[51:59] oh you see you see sometimes while
[52:02] Miniatures get kind of get they get kind
[52:03] of caught up in what they see because
[52:08] it seems like everybody's so indifferent
[52:11] it seems like people can't be touched
[52:13] anymore but there are some that are
[52:15] still being touched there are some that
[52:17] God is able to soften up their heart
[52:19] brother said you could not go to heaven
[52:22] without the blood of the Lord Jesus no
[52:24] matter how good you are it's only
[52:27] self-made righteousness when you try to
[52:29] act with your Stony heart and you're
[52:31] you're made up religion with what you
[52:33] think God requires
[52:35] we don't go to heaven on self-made
[52:38] righteousness no matter how good you are
[52:40] it's totally impossible for you to get
[52:43] to heaven on your goodness
[52:45] it's totally impossible for you to get
[52:48] to heaven on your goodness totally
[52:50] impossible for you to get to heaven on
[52:52] your own Works what kind of a greater
[52:54] sales pitch could there be than that
[52:56] come unto me all ye that are labor all
[52:58] you that are labor and under your own
[53:00] Works labor and under your own efforts
[53:02] and I will give you rest
[53:06] you know how to soften up a Stony heart
[53:09] present something real to us
[53:14] maybe that's a lesson for us parents you
[53:17] want to soften up a Stony heart your
[53:18] kids coming around and their hearts all
[53:20] Stony let them see something real let
[53:22] them hear The Echoes of Mom and Daddy's
[53:24] prayers when they come in the door let
[53:25] them hear The Echoes of brother Brown's
[53:27] voice when they come in the door let
[53:29] them not see Mom and Daddy uh arguing
[53:31] and screaming each other throwing their
[53:33] hands back and screaming until the veins
[53:34] pop out let them not see the TV playing
[53:37] in players but let them see a genuine
[53:40] Holy Ghost Field House
[53:42] I I remember I want I'll just share this
[53:46] Monica when she was growing up she she'd
[53:48] go over the uh to the Tim Pruitt's house
[53:51] over there in Louisiana and she said I
[53:54] knew that that was a Christian home you
[53:56] go into that home and you knew that that
[53:58] man was a was a real Christian how about
[54:01] us how can we say wouldn't you want
[54:04] somebody to have that testimony about
[54:05] you I sure would like somebody to have
[54:07] that testimony about me when I come to
[54:09] when I come to brother Bob's house now
[54:11] you sure of course you have to make up
[54:13] your mind whether that's true or not but
[54:15] when you go to somebody's house to walk
[54:17] in the door and see this is a real
[54:19] Christian home why because the world is
[54:21] after something genuine the world is out
[54:24] they want to see something genuine or
[54:26] real and there is a genuine there's a
[54:28] real Holy Ghost Field believer out there
[54:30] and that's what will soften up a heart a
[54:34] stolen heart
[54:35] whether I'm told a story of that man uh
[54:37] Bert that uh he said he said I never
[54:40] seen a man so cold-hearted in my life
[54:43] and he went he'd go hunting with a
[54:45] brother Brown and he said he'd kill
[54:46] phones just to make me feel bad and yet
[54:49] of course brother Brown explained you
[54:50] know there's nothing wrong with killing
[54:52] a phone it's you know Abraham killed a
[54:54] calf there's nothing wrong with that but
[54:55] to do it just because he knew it
[54:57] bothered brother Brown to see it
[54:59] bothered brother random to see him just
[55:00] killing him for sport just one after the
[55:02] other and yet he'd do it anyway and that
[55:05] man's heart was so stone cold so Stony
[55:08] until it he just he wanted to see
[55:10] brother Brown a prophet of God suffer as
[55:13] he shot a phone now some of us how many
[55:16] of us would look at that situation and
[55:18] say well he's too far gone he's too far
[55:21] gone but you see the Nets got to be cast
[55:23] because we don't know but we don't know
[55:27] I don't know all I know is that the
[55:30] gospel is available for who's whoever
[55:32] will whosoever will let him come I don't
[55:35] know your heart but God knows it this
[55:37] afternoon and brother Brown said he took
[55:39] that little whistle and he and he blew
[55:41] it because the the deer to come out and
[55:44] that little Fawn was there and he said
[55:45] that's just to my surprise that's across
[55:47] the opening a great big beautiful doe
[55:49] stood up and he and he blew that whistle
[55:51] and they and the doe saw him but yet the
[55:53] doe well bro what did Brother Brown say
[55:55] the quality of that dough was real he
[55:59] saw something genuine
[56:02] he said she wasn't a hypocrite That Dope
[56:04] wasn't no hypocrite she wasn't putting
[56:06] that on she was real she was born
[56:10] something in her was a mother
[56:12] and a baby was in trouble and she was a
[56:15] mother the Instinct in her mother
[56:16] instinct would walk right in the face of
[56:18] that gun knowing that she was going to
[56:21] her death what difference did it make
[56:23] she was going to find that baby it was
[56:27] in trouble she wasn't putting nothing on
[56:29] he saw something so genuine in that
[56:32] little mother deer that she was willing
[56:34] to die for that baby she knew that man
[56:38] was danger but she was willing to die
[56:40] for that and when he started to raise
[56:41] his head up well that's the backwards
[56:43] quote he said well I'm going back in in
[56:45] my quote
[56:46] so I'll skip over that one he said now
[56:49] that mother walking right out not a
[56:51] hypocrite not putting on like a lot of
[56:53] church members do act like they're
[56:55] Christians when The Showdown comes
[56:57] they're ashamed of it she walked out
[56:58] right out there with something real she
[57:01] stood there and was ready to meet her
[57:03] death because of what inside of her she
[57:06] was a mother and a baby was in trouble
[57:08] he threw his arms around my trouser legs
[57:10] and said Billy I've had enough of it
[57:12] lead me to that Lord Jesus that you're
[57:15] talking about now you see you see when
[57:17] you whenever whenever somebody that's
[57:19] got a soft heart when they see something
[57:21] Stony heart when they see something
[57:22] genuine it starts to change him I was
[57:26] talking to the brother
[57:27] I'm trying not to like name names but uh
[57:29] you can figure it out they just preached
[57:31] here and and
[57:33] he was talking about going over to
[57:36] Africa and he said when the people see
[57:38] something genuine when they see
[57:40] something genuine then they give their
[57:42] whole heart to it when they see what
[57:45] genuine the spirit of the Lord move
[57:46] people beginning to receive their
[57:48] Deliverance God moving amongst the the
[57:50] the the the people God moving moving
[57:53] through the building and he said brother
[57:54] Brown said the world tonight is looking
[57:56] for something genuine the people of this
[57:58] nation of the rest of the world is
[58:00] looking to the church for something
[58:01] genuine science has brought us death
[58:04] Society has brought us corruption Church
[58:06] organizations brought us fusses the
[58:08] people want something real when they see
[58:11] that display they're ready
[58:13] God's got it we talk about a god
[58:17] where is he there is a genuine baptism a
[58:20] holy ghost oh I think that should that
[58:22] should inform the how we How We Do
[58:24] Everything how we live our lives at work
[58:26] how we live our lives in front of our
[58:28] children because the whole world is
[58:30] looking for something genuine
[58:32] and brother Adam said if we only need
[58:33] now listen to this quote y'all before
[58:36] you fall asleep before you go into the
[58:38] arms of Morpheus
[58:40] if you if we only need the intellectual
[58:42] conception of man
[58:44] we don't need the Holy Spirit
[58:47] now listen now if we only need the
[58:49] intellectual conception of man we don't
[58:52] need the Holy Spirit
[58:54] if the church is to be run and governed
[58:56] upon the intellects the educational
[58:58] program and upon the intellects of
[58:59] mankind we don't need the Holy Spirit
[59:02] and if it's to be run by the Holy Spirit
[59:05] we don't need the intellectuals
[59:08] it's either one or the other now this is
[59:10] what brother Brown is saying so he's
[59:13] saying we don't need we don't need a
[59:16] made-up fake trying to do it your own
[59:19] self by your own Works what you think is
[59:22] right and wrong why you think the
[59:24] scripture fits together we don't need
[59:26] that what we need is a genuine baptism
[59:29] of the Holy Ghost a genuine baptism the
[59:32] Holy Ghost of the church and ourselves
[59:34] and a house and sometimes when I'm in
[59:37] prayer I Lay My Hands on the wall of my
[59:38] house and I say God sanctify every wall
[59:41] in this home because I want my home
[59:43] filled with the baptism my Holy Ghost I
[59:45] want my life filled with the Holy Ghost
[59:46] because it's what the whole the Holy
[59:49] Ghost is what we need the spirit of the
[59:51] Living God is what you need the spirit
[59:53] of the Living God is what powers the
[59:55] church it's what powers your life it's
[59:57] what power you're thinking it's what
[59:59] puts all the scripture together that's
[1:00:01] what you need now you think about the
[1:00:03] thing about the difference between all
[1:00:05] these people in the scripture that we
[1:00:07] can look at as role models that weren't
[1:00:09] relying on the spirit of God to rule
[1:00:12] their life look how much better a man
[1:00:14] Esau was in Jacob but he didn't have the
[1:00:17] conception to know he had sold his
[1:00:19] Birthright
[1:00:20] Esau was a great mother he was so much
[1:00:22] better man than Jacob because he was he
[1:00:25] was trying to do it by his intellectuals
[1:00:27] he saw Esau was formed far more of a
[1:00:30] gentleman brother Brown said and a
[1:00:31] neighbor and a man of works and what
[1:00:33] Jacob was
[1:00:34] listen Esau Esau was probably always at
[1:00:37] the hospital he was probably always
[1:00:40] walking down the aisle of the hospital
[1:00:42] I'm bringing over in this day I bring it
[1:00:44] over in modern days he was probably
[1:00:45] always working at the soup lines he was
[1:00:48] probably always volunteering his time he
[1:00:51] was probably always down at the homeless
[1:00:53] shelter he was probably when you go to
[1:00:54] Walmart and when he saw I would go to
[1:00:56] Walmart and and pull up and see somebody
[1:00:59] begging for money there he'd probably
[1:01:01] always give him some money he probably
[1:01:04] he was probably always at the nursing
[1:01:05] home singing and playing instruments and
[1:01:08] stuff he was probably always busy mowing
[1:01:11] the Widow's loans he was probably always
[1:01:14] a bag of candy he saw I'm looking I'm
[1:01:16] bringing it up to modern times he had a
[1:01:18] he had a bag of candy that he brought
[1:01:20] with him to church and he had passed it
[1:01:21] out to all the kids he was doing
[1:01:23] everything right
[1:01:25] Esau was going to all the kids soccer
[1:01:27] games and all the football games and all
[1:01:30] their after-school events so nobody
[1:01:31] could get upset with him he was doing
[1:01:33] everything right he was doing all the
[1:01:35] stuff by the book but you see that's not
[1:01:38] what's required
[1:01:40] Esau didn't care about that Birthright
[1:01:43] he cared so little about that Birthright
[1:01:44] that he sold it for a little bowl a
[1:01:46] little soup every time I'm in the
[1:01:47] grocery store and I see little soup on
[1:01:49] the supermarket on the on uh up there
[1:01:51] for sale I think he saw you sold your
[1:01:53] Birthright for that can of lentil soup
[1:01:56] that's what you sold your Birthright for
[1:01:58] but Jacob
[1:02:00] Jacob had a recompense to that
[1:02:02] Birthright
[1:02:03] you know how much recompense Jacob had
[1:02:06] to that brother right he's he said
[1:02:07] within himself I don't care if I have to
[1:02:10] run away from my house if everybody
[1:02:12] hates me if my daddy don't like me
[1:02:13] anymore if my if I lose all my
[1:02:15] reputation if if I had to be a little
[1:02:17] cheat for a little bit or he was willing
[1:02:20] to give it all over to get that whatever
[1:02:22] he had to do to get that birth right and
[1:02:25] I think some of us sometimes we sit so
[1:02:27] cold and we can't even squeeze a tear
[1:02:29] out we can't hardly to get moved At All
[1:02:31] by the preaching of the Gospel but Jacob
[1:02:33] was willing to give everything for that
[1:02:35] for that Birthright why because it meant
[1:02:38] something to it and it missed you know
[1:02:40] what the birthright means to you today
[1:02:41] it means eternal life it means
[1:02:43] deliverance from all that to all that
[1:02:46] stuff that you're dealing through all
[1:02:47] that turmoil of your mind it means peace
[1:02:49] and joy in your soul when you lay your
[1:02:51] head down on your pill at night peace to
[1:02:53] know that God is with you that God cares
[1:02:55] about you peace to know that in time of
[1:02:58] trouble there's somebody that you can
[1:02:59] turn to that's past all the men and all
[1:03:03] the great things of this Earth but
[1:03:04] there's a God that you can turn to
[1:03:06] that's touched by the feelings of your
[1:03:08] infirmities
[1:03:10] Esau was a gentleman in every respect
[1:03:12] but Jacob had recompense to that
[1:03:14] Birthright that's his whole motive no
[1:03:17] matter what it cost him he wanted the
[1:03:18] birthright
[1:03:19] y'all realize I'm just preaching what
[1:03:21] brother Brown said I hope I don't know
[1:03:23] how many people realize but I'm just
[1:03:25] saying what he said he said say what I
[1:03:27] say and that's what I'm doing I'm saying
[1:03:28] what he said
[1:03:29] let me ask you this question
[1:03:34] how many how many Jacobs do we have here
[1:03:37] this afternoon how many are willing to
[1:03:40] just lay everything down for that
[1:03:42] Birthright how many you say well I've
[1:03:44] already got the new birth but there's
[1:03:46] more of that for you there's more if
[1:03:48] you'll just keep climbing I bet you've
[1:03:49] got to be willing to lay everything down
[1:03:51] for it you know sometimes you get to a
[1:03:53] place where it seems like you hit a wall
[1:03:55] and you hit a ceiling but sometimes you
[1:03:57] gotta you gotta really you gotta push to
[1:03:59] break through you got to study a little
[1:04:01] bit more you got to pray a little bit
[1:04:02] more dig a little bit deeper study into
[1:04:05] the wee hours of the night because we're
[1:04:07] going somewhere where are we going we're
[1:04:09] going to a body change to the final
[1:04:11] baptism of the Holy Ghost where God
[1:04:13] feels every fiber of your being until
[1:04:15] every atom in your body has changed
[1:04:19] Jacob was going to get that blessing it
[1:04:22] didn't matter to him if he had to sneak
[1:04:23] around to get it if he had to endure
[1:04:25] trials if he had to run for his life if
[1:04:27] he had to leave his father and mother it
[1:04:29] didn't matter
[1:04:30] does it matter to you
[1:04:32] does it matter
[1:04:34] the Holy Ghost is what makes the
[1:04:36] difference
[1:04:37] the Holy Ghost
[1:04:39] the birthright is what makes the
[1:04:41] difference
[1:04:41] why does it make the difference because
[1:04:43] the Holy Ghost is what quickens the word
[1:04:45] we read all these things and we pack in
[1:04:47] all this knowledge you know that's what
[1:04:48] you're doing when you're going through
[1:04:49] sanctification you're packing in that
[1:04:51] word your people say things I don't
[1:04:53] understand man you study out a little
[1:04:54] bit more and then then you you got to a
[1:04:57] place where you got it laying there but
[1:04:59] it's intellectual but the spirit will
[1:05:01] Quicken it and make it live you you
[1:05:04] think well as the Bible says I'm
[1:05:05] supposed to love somebody the Bible says
[1:05:07] I'm supposed to be real forgiving but
[1:05:09] when that Spirit comes and quickens it
[1:05:11] it makes it live
[1:05:13] it makes it come off the page that's why
[1:05:15] it brings life to the body it puts the
[1:05:17] puzzle together it puts all these things
[1:05:20] that we're studying together it puts all
[1:05:21] the statue of a perfect man and adoption
[1:05:23] and the Capstone and Daniel 70 weeks in
[1:05:25] the revelation of the Seven Seals and
[1:05:27] who is this Melchizedek and it puts it
[1:05:29] all together and ties it all together so
[1:05:32] you can see the complete revelation of
[1:05:34] Jesus Christ the power the spirit of the
[1:05:36] Living God is what powers the church
[1:05:38] it's what runs the machine do you
[1:05:41] realize this is a machine did you
[1:05:43] realize that you know we didn't talk
[1:05:45] actually before before today about who
[1:05:47] was gonna who's gonna take up prayer
[1:05:49] requests and this morning I took up
[1:05:51] prayer request and this afternoon Louise
[1:05:53] took up prayer requests and nobody I
[1:05:55] don't think anybody said well you need
[1:05:56] to take up prayer requests I don't think
[1:05:57] anybody did but it just why because
[1:06:00] there's a spirit of a living God that's
[1:06:01] that just moves moves you today and
[1:06:04] starts listen if you yield yourself the
[1:06:06] machine will just run the machine will
[1:06:08] just operate it'll just move oh
[1:06:11] the spirit of the Living God is what
[1:06:13] draws The Sinner
[1:06:15] and brother said he said if he can
[1:06:16] present the program and talk about these
[1:06:18] modern churches we'll build a great
[1:06:20] church we'll call it a certain name
[1:06:23] we'll attract the attention of the
[1:06:25] people all through the city when we play
[1:06:26] Chimes every Sunday morning we'll
[1:06:28] attract the attention to the poor Law
[1:06:29] Center in the gutter when he sees it we
[1:06:31] wear the better clothes when he sees it
[1:06:33] our women can fix their hair the poor
[1:06:36] women can see how women can do their
[1:06:38] hair what nice hats they wear and we
[1:06:40] when we present this to the people the
[1:06:42] poor and hungry will then come to our
[1:06:43] meetings and will desire to be as these
[1:06:45] women are and he goes on and on about
[1:06:47] all these things that churches think
[1:06:48] think is what draws people if we have a
[1:06:51] nice Clear Place Glass Pulpit if we have
[1:06:53] a Starbucks down in the bottom if we
[1:06:55] have a nice a nice little place glass
[1:06:57] thing around the drum set if we have
[1:06:59] some lights and maybe a little smoke
[1:07:01] machine that might that might draw but
[1:07:03] if we can if we can maybe have a little
[1:07:05] Outreach where we give sandwiches to the
[1:07:07] poor and things but you see that's not
[1:07:08] that's not what draw what draws
[1:07:11] actually what draws the the Stony heart
[1:07:14] is not a church that works real hard and
[1:07:16] puts everything out on social media and
[1:07:18] just stays busy busy busy busy busy busy
[1:07:21] busy but what draws is the spirit of the
[1:07:24] Lord moving the spirit of the Living God
[1:07:26] brother I'm sitting down if that is
[1:07:28] God's program they're right but Jesus
[1:07:30] never quoted that that way he said if I
[1:07:32] be lifted up I'll draw all men to me and
[1:07:35] he said but man is not drawn to Christ
[1:07:37] by intellectuals by theology the Holy
[1:07:40] Spirit alone is God's drawing power the
[1:07:44] Holy Spirit alone is God's drawing power
[1:07:47] the poor will never receive it and the
[1:07:49] rich can't until they become poor of
[1:07:50] these things of the world so don't be
[1:07:52] critical now when you're sitting here
[1:07:56] don't be critical don't be critical of
[1:07:59] the spirit moving in the church don't be
[1:08:01] critical is that because that's what we
[1:08:03] need that's what we need more of is we
[1:08:05] need the spirit of the Living God moving
[1:08:07] somebody might get too fanatical that's
[1:08:10] listen we'll deal with that when the
[1:08:12] time comes somebody somebody might get
[1:08:14] false anointed well we I think we got
[1:08:17] enough teaching when we can avoid that
[1:08:19] that's right
[1:08:21] somebody might get a you know what
[1:08:23] somebody might get I might get a genuine
[1:08:25] salad salvation they might get a genuine
[1:08:28] healing they might get a genuine baptism
[1:08:31] of the Holy Ghost because what do we
[1:08:33] want we want a genuine Christianity not
[1:08:35] something acted out
[1:08:37] brother said in this being the
[1:08:38] intellectual type of churches that we
[1:08:40] have today in America and all over the
[1:08:42] world the Christian the believer the
[1:08:43] church member reading the Bible sees
[1:08:45] that he must try to act humble he must
[1:08:48] try to be this way
[1:08:50] but in doing so he only makes a carnal
[1:08:52] impersonation let that soak deep
[1:08:56] a carnal comparison
[1:08:59] he's trying to act something that he
[1:09:01] really isn't in his heart
[1:09:03] in his heart he's thinking one thing and
[1:09:06] trying to act another which in real
[1:09:08] genuine language that makes him a
[1:09:10] hypocrite
[1:09:12] so there's your definition of what it
[1:09:13] means to be an intellectual
[1:09:15] you know you should be humble so you're
[1:09:18] trying to be humble you know you
[1:09:21] shouldn't lie
[1:09:22] so you you try not to lie but when the
[1:09:25] opportunity arises you slip out a little
[1:09:27] lie just to kind of cover things up and
[1:09:29] cover Your Tracks you know you know how
[1:09:32] to fake it because you can read what's
[1:09:34] required
[1:09:35] and you know when to be careful
[1:09:37] you know when you know some Doctrine
[1:09:41] but this new deal that God is with the
[1:09:43] church that was presented at Pentecost
[1:09:44] is not an intellectual at all but 120
[1:09:48] fishermen tent makers and Housewives
[1:09:49] went up in the upper room and waited
[1:09:52] until God's prophecy was fulfilled and
[1:09:56] they received the baptism of the Holy
[1:09:58] Ghost
[1:09:59] that's why Jesus told them don't you
[1:10:01] stop your preaching don't Don't Preach
[1:10:03] just go over to Jerusalem and wait
[1:10:05] because if you just keep preaching it's
[1:10:07] going to mess everything up you need to
[1:10:08] wait until you're endued with power from
[1:10:10] on high because the spirit of the Lord
[1:10:12] the baptism of the Holy Ghost is what
[1:10:14] puts the doctrine together if it wasn't
[1:10:16] for the baptism of the Holy Ghost Peter
[1:10:18] wouldn't know how to open up the door
[1:10:20] when he came down when he came
[1:10:21] downstairs that day he wouldn't have
[1:10:22] known what what uh how to answer that
[1:10:24] when they said men and brother and what
[1:10:26] should we do
[1:10:27] he'd tried to put together with his own
[1:10:29] intellectual thinking
[1:10:31] you know what intellectual Faith
[1:10:33] intellectual Faith can't produce the
[1:10:34] power
[1:10:37] intellectual Faith Can't cast out devils
[1:10:40] intellectual Faith can't produce the
[1:10:42] signs
[1:10:43] and these signs shall follow them that
[1:10:45] believe
[1:10:47] and that's important when you start
[1:10:48] getting into this scripture that we're
[1:10:49] preaching on this afternoon Ezekiel 11.
[1:10:52] because devil a devil's got to be cast
[1:10:54] out the unclean spirit's got to leave an
[1:10:56] intellectual Faith ain't going to cast
[1:10:58] it out
[1:10:59] that was to be the sign of the believer
[1:11:01] instead of the educated and intellectual
[1:11:03] because the intellectual the
[1:11:05] intellectual cannot produce that the
[1:11:08] power of God in their life
[1:11:10] right
[1:11:12] right I feel like I should just talk for
[1:11:14] five more minutes so y'all can get your
[1:11:15] nap out
[1:11:25] it's all right
[1:11:28] I'm being nice
[1:11:30] Ezekiel was Ezekiel was looking ahead
[1:11:33] though he was looking ahead that God was
[1:11:35] going to make a new church a new church
[1:11:38] with a new testament New Covenant what
[1:11:40] kind of a New Covenant that God would
[1:11:42] put his life into the church a new
[1:11:44] priesthood with a new heart
[1:11:46] that's why Ezekiel 11 says I I will take
[1:11:49] the Stony heart out of their flesh and
[1:11:51] will give them a heart of Flesh not not
[1:11:54] you're going to do it but I God will
[1:11:57] take that Stony heart away not you'll
[1:12:00] throw it away but I'll take it away in
[1:12:03] other words it's Grace God is the one
[1:12:05] that's doing the work I will take the
[1:12:08] old Stony heart out and put a fleshy
[1:12:10] heart in now watch he said he would do
[1:12:12] that you can't talk that in an old
[1:12:15] intellectual church because the
[1:12:16] intellectual Church would just want to
[1:12:18] fake it and just go along with her old
[1:12:20] carnal idea but a church that wants a
[1:12:22] genuine baptism in the Holy Ghost wants
[1:12:24] something real not an intellectual
[1:12:26] facelift not just a facelift where you
[1:12:28] go into the surgeon and they pull
[1:12:30] everything up and straighten out your
[1:12:32] face but but down on the inside you're
[1:12:35] really 70 years old or whatever down on
[1:12:37] the inside you're really 65 or whatever
[1:12:39] it is but you got a facelift to make you
[1:12:41] look real pretty on the outside but on
[1:12:43] the on the inside you're still as old as
[1:12:45] you as you always were he's at the
[1:12:48] intellectual with the old lady they give
[1:12:49] her a facelift she's still the same old
[1:12:51] woman the old man they give him a
[1:12:53] facelift he's just the same old man I
[1:12:55] turn my new page on New Year's and I'll
[1:12:57] start life new I'll throw away my pipe
[1:13:00] and pick it up the next day that's just
[1:13:01] you it ain't a face lifting it's a birth
[1:13:04] the church needs the church needs the
[1:13:07] spirit of the Living God you say I'm
[1:13:09] gonna go I'm gonna stop smoking I'm
[1:13:12] gonna be I'm gonna be nice to my wife
[1:13:14] now and you play make that play we're
[1:13:16] coming on toward the end of the new the
[1:13:18] end of the year on into the new year and
[1:13:20] people are going to make make their
[1:13:21] pledges this next year I'm going to be a
[1:13:23] better person I'm going to be I'm going
[1:13:25] to be nice to my husband I'm going to be
[1:13:27] nice to my wife I'm gonna stop snapping
[1:13:29] at people at work I'm going to stop
[1:13:30] being so ugly I'm going to be I'm going
[1:13:33] to be real active in the neighborhood
[1:13:34] I'm going to give to all the poor and
[1:13:36] help the homeless and all those kind of
[1:13:38] things but we don't need a facelift we
[1:13:40] need a real genuine baptism of the Holy
[1:13:42] Ghost we don't need our works what we
[1:13:44] need is Christ we don't need our
[1:13:46] resolution as we need verse
[1:13:49] yeah so first brother I'm saying I'm
[1:13:52] finally almost as as we're almost to an
[1:13:54] hour I'm getting to my topic but don't
[1:13:56] be scared I'm not going to keep you I
[1:13:58] know how everybody
[1:14:00] oh no he's still got a lot of water left

[1:14:10] we're at home this afternoon
[1:14:13] and brother I'm sitting down notice the
[1:14:15] first order of the scripture is perfect
[1:14:17] God said first I'll take away the old
[1:14:20] Stony heart
[1:14:22] what's that Stony heart you can't
[1:14:23] receive nothing How You Gonna receive
[1:14:25] anything if your heart's so stoned up
[1:14:27] that you you can't even squeeze a tear
[1:14:30] out you can't even raise your hand up
[1:14:32] you don't respond you can't even hardly
[1:14:34] Say Amen
[1:14:36] the Lord is not unto them that are of a
[1:14:38] broken heart a broken a heart that's all
[1:14:40] tilled up ready to receive God a heart
[1:14:42] that's that's that that's that's that
[1:14:44] that God has turned from Stone to flesh
[1:14:47] and savings such as be of a contrite
[1:14:50] spirit that's why David said search me o
[1:14:53] God and no more you know what a a fleshy
[1:14:55] heart a fleshy heart is willing that
[1:14:57] they're they're seeking they're willing
[1:14:59] for God to search them out and find the
[1:15:02] trouble find the problem are you willing
[1:15:04] this afternoon for God to give you a
[1:15:06] little inspection to go lay on the
[1:15:08] operating table and let the doctor of
[1:15:10] God's word examine you and find out
[1:15:12] what's wrong a soft heart is broken up
[1:15:15] and ready to receive God and then he
[1:15:17] said I'll give you a new spirit
[1:15:19] yes the spirit you had you couldn't even
[1:15:21] get along with yourself so how you're
[1:15:23] going to get along with God what's that
[1:15:25] mean you couldn't get along with
[1:15:26] yourself you run out you run out to the
[1:15:28] liquor store and as soon as you get
[1:15:29] drunk you got a headache the next
[1:15:31] morning you got a big old migraine and
[1:15:32] you start I wish I wouldn't have done
[1:15:34] that if I could just stop drinking if I
[1:15:38] could just stop doing that oh you you
[1:15:40] get alone sometimes when your mom and
[1:15:41] daddy ain't looking and you start
[1:15:42] looking at dirty dirty magazines or
[1:15:44] dirty websites and the very next day
[1:15:46] what are you gonna do all right right
[1:15:48] after you're gonna I wish I wish there
[1:15:51] was how can I get rid of this iniquity
[1:15:53] how can I get you might not use that
[1:15:55] word how can I get with it rid of this
[1:15:57] problem in my life
[1:15:59] children that backed out their parents
[1:16:01] and say something horrible and get in
[1:16:03] trouble for and you how I wish I
[1:16:06] wouldn't do that disrespectful people
[1:16:08] running around chewing tobacco in secret
[1:16:10] and they know they shouldn't do that
[1:16:12] they got that little tobacco water in
[1:16:13] their back pocket and they come to
[1:16:15] church and they they know they shouldn't
[1:16:16] and they know people are looking at them
[1:16:18] but they know they shouldn't be doing
[1:16:19] that but they're the spirit that they
[1:16:22] got they can't get along with themselves
[1:16:24] there's something there's something
[1:16:25] grieving them on only in their their own
[1:16:28] natural abilities
[1:16:30] you know when you you think back to
[1:16:32] people in in high school sneaking around
[1:16:34] behind the football stands and doing
[1:16:36] stuff they shouldn't and then as soon as
[1:16:37] they get done I wish that I wouldn't
[1:16:40] have done that you can't get even alone
[1:16:41] with yourself you can't get along with
[1:16:43] your own actions you're regretting your
[1:16:46] actions the very next morning and what
[1:16:48] what ends up happening you end up
[1:16:49] despising yourself that's why all these
[1:16:51] suicides and things among young people
[1:16:53] the the devil gets you into a fix where
[1:16:55] you you can't even stand yourself and
[1:16:57] you start I don't like myself you can't
[1:16:59] get along with yourself
[1:17:02] oh
[1:17:04] you know the commission that Jesus gave
[1:17:06] was go into all the world and preach
[1:17:10] cast out devils
[1:17:12] in my name they shall cast out devils
[1:17:14] in Matthew 10 he told them before they
[1:17:16] even got the Holy Ghost the Kingdom of
[1:17:18] Heaven is at hand heal the sick cleanse
[1:17:20] the lepers raise the Dead cast out
[1:17:21] devils freely have received freely give
[1:17:24] we've been commissioned to cast out
[1:17:26] Devils cast out what Devils cast out
[1:17:29] that unclean spirit and when that
[1:17:31] uncle's clean spirit's gone then you're
[1:17:34] you're set so that you can believe so
[1:17:36] that you can receive
[1:17:38] how you cast out Devils the same way
[1:17:40] Jesus did in Matthew chapter 8 he said
[1:17:43] when they even was come they brought
[1:17:44] unto him many that were possessed with
[1:17:46] devils and he cast out the spirits with
[1:17:48] his word and healed all that were sick

[1:20:49] the house is ready for occupancy
[1:20:52] so brother Ryan will say he said your
[1:20:53] first step is a heart of Flesh
[1:20:55] a heart of flesh is I don't want to go
[1:20:57] to hell
[1:20:58] I want to accept Christ and your second
[1:21:01] step is a new spirit what's that new
[1:21:03] spirit a new desire I want to do right
[1:21:06] then God's holy spirit
[1:21:08] God's spirit the holy spirit sets right
[1:21:11] in the center of your new spirit and
[1:21:13] there it controls your emotions
[1:21:15] what what is that when when God comes
[1:21:18] and lives in you
[1:21:20] when he lives in you then it's like you
[1:21:22] know you sometimes you drive by houses
[1:21:24] at night and you wonder if anybody lives
[1:21:26] there and I've I've we've we've we've
[1:21:29] driven over the years to church and
[1:21:30] we've watched houses that that people
[1:21:32] kind of fell into a disrepair and you
[1:21:35] start seeing the roof cave in and seeing
[1:21:37] the house kind of fall down until as
[1:21:40] long as we've been coming to church here
[1:21:42] there's one house we watch to actually
[1:21:44] fall all the way to the ground and you
[1:21:46] can tell there ain't nobody living there
[1:21:47] but if there's somebody that's living
[1:21:49] there there's somebody that's going to
[1:21:51] keep that place clean there's somebody
[1:21:53] that's going to keep the roof patched
[1:21:55] and the pantry full is going to keep
[1:21:57] somebody that's going to keep food there
[1:21:58] that's going to attend the garden
[1:22:00] there's somebody that's going to be able
[1:22:02] to answer the door when the Devil comes
[1:22:05] knocking there's somebody there is going
[1:22:07] to kick out any squatters anybody that
[1:22:09] comes around and says well you can't
[1:22:11] have access to this no this is my
[1:22:12] property this is my promise in the Bible
[1:22:15] that's what the Holy Spirit does the
[1:22:18] holy spirit is there in your Tower
[1:22:19] knuckle and he's there to kick the devil
[1:22:22] out when the Devil comes around and says
[1:22:25] well you can't have healing you can't
[1:22:26] have this promises laying in the Bible
[1:22:28] you I don't know if this is for you the
[1:22:30] the Holy Ghost is there to tell the
[1:22:33] devil I I when you know like
[1:22:36] uh solicitors come knocking on the door
[1:22:38] do you want to buy something no I don't
[1:22:40] want to buy what you're selling I don't
[1:22:42] want to buy it get out of here and
[1:22:44] there's somebody there at the house you
[1:22:46] drive around at night this is my point
[1:22:48] that I was talking about that you drive
[1:22:49] around at night sometimes and you don't
[1:22:51] know if somebody's living there but
[1:22:52] there's a light on there's a light on in
[1:22:54] the house and you can there I know
[1:22:55] somebody's there because there's a light
[1:22:58] on in the house and when the Holy Ghost
[1:23:00] is there the light is on and let me tell
[1:23:03] you tonight there is a man that could
[1:23:04] turn on the light if the gospel is all
[1:23:06] confusing to you you don't know what
[1:23:08] it's about there's a man that can turn
[1:23:09] the light on so that somebody is home
[1:23:13] listen the neighbors can tell if
[1:23:15] somebody's home or not the neighbor if
[1:23:17] you got a dog there's a dog barking the
[1:23:18] signs of life in the house the signs
[1:23:21] that somebody's there because the light
[1:23:23] is on Christ has taken up residence
[1:23:25] Christ is there and he's in control when
[1:23:28] God moves in he's in control of you and
[1:23:31] brother I said it's like a mainspring
[1:23:33] you know what a mainspring is and a
[1:23:34] watch the mainspring is you you wind it
[1:23:37] up real tight IT coils around and you
[1:23:39] wind it up and it actually is the thing
[1:23:41] that gives power to the watch
[1:23:43] you wind it up that's what you turned
[1:23:45] that little thing with and it winds up
[1:23:46] that mainspring and for the rest of the
[1:23:48] day it's turning the hands of that watch
[1:23:50] but the Holy Ghost is a mainspring that
[1:23:53] powers your life it's down on the inside
[1:23:55] and it Powers your being it Powers your
[1:23:57] thoughts it Powers your Consciousness it
[1:23:59] Powers everything but it's a mainspring
[1:24:01] that you don't have to keep wound up it
[1:24:03] was wound from eternity from the
[1:24:05] foundation of the world like brother
[1:24:07] Louise was talking about this morning
[1:24:08] brother see you don't have to wind it
[1:24:10] every day God's wound it once for all
[1:24:13] and he sits right in the middle of your
[1:24:15] new life and as the mainstream is
[1:24:17] bringing it as it relieves and ticks
[1:24:19] away that what the watch it controls
[1:24:22] every little organism of that watch to
[1:24:24] perfect time it controls everything it
[1:24:28] controls because God is in the house now
[1:24:32] this afternoon how would you like for
[1:24:34] God to live in your house to control
[1:24:36] your thoughts to control your being to
[1:24:38] control your makeup to power your mind
[1:24:40] to power your thinking to give you a
[1:24:42] power that when you can speak your word
[1:24:44] and speak peace into your family speak
[1:24:48] your children back to home speak your
[1:24:50] loved ones back that God has given that
[1:24:53] kind of a power I'm not just speaking
[1:24:55] something of intellectual understanding
[1:24:56] this afternoon I'm speaking of living
[1:24:58] reality to you that if you'll yield
[1:25:00] yourself to him God will come and
[1:25:02] Tabernacle himself in you and set up
[1:25:05] resonance in your home and turn the
[1:25:07] light on so that all the neighbors and
[1:25:09] you know and you're all around can see
[1:25:11] that somebody lives there somebody is at
[1:25:15] home
[1:25:18] it controls everything that's within you
[1:25:21] put you in decent makes the church acts
[1:25:23] orderly makes the gifts work perfect
[1:25:26] and if you have to be taken from a place
[1:25:27] where you think you should be and put
[1:25:29] down somewhere else it controls oh
[1:25:32] now he's getting real
[1:25:34] maybe somebody on church say well you
[1:25:36] shouldn't do that or whatever
[1:25:38] the Holy Ghost in you will keep you from
[1:25:41] being offended
[1:25:44] he said that shows the mainspring is not
[1:25:46] there
[1:25:46] when you blow up at every little thing
[1:25:48] that happens
[1:25:49] and when the pastor happens to hit
[1:25:52] something that's in the word
[1:25:54] and you and brother Brown makes a
[1:25:57] spitting noise
[1:25:58] say I don't believe that look out
[1:26:01] old cowhide he's talking about those you
[1:26:03] can't put new wine in Old bottles
[1:26:05] because a old bottle will blow up
[1:26:08] what's blowing up means blow it up you
[1:26:12] ain't got that that Holy Ghost anointing
[1:26:14] over the cow High over the hide to make
[1:26:16] it expand and so when the word Goes
[1:26:19] Forth you start saying well if I don't
[1:26:21] get my way if I don't get my way in the
[1:26:23] church I'm just leaving out here if they
[1:26:25] won't come to to everything I put on I'm
[1:26:27] leaving if I I don't understand why I
[1:26:29] don't have to dress modestly I don't
[1:26:31] understand why I have to do this I'm
[1:26:32] leaving I'm out of here
[1:26:34] if that preacher wasn't so long-winded I
[1:26:36] could go to church
[1:26:39] if that preacher if that preacher would
[1:26:40] preach a little bit shorter if he would
[1:26:42] stop stepping on my toes and but boy I
[1:26:44] could really go to church see you need a
[1:26:46] little bit more of the Holy Ghost to all
[1:26:47] of the cowhide well you get enough holy
[1:26:49] ghost in you come to you'll bring the
[1:26:51] Holy Ghost with you to church and when
[1:26:53] somebody steps in your door of your home
[1:26:55] they'll find out the Holy Ghost is
[1:26:57] already there you say well I don't want
[1:26:59] to be humiliated I don't want another I
[1:27:01] don't want my pride to us or nothing I
[1:27:03] can't stand for them to call me a Holy
[1:27:05] Roller you need a little bit more oil
[1:27:07] how oh how about this I think I'm fine
[1:27:11] just the way I am
[1:27:15] that's the that's the worst one of all
[1:27:18] sometimes you try to talk people and you
[1:27:20] know if you think you're fine the way
[1:27:21] you are
[1:27:22] it I just can't stand to talk to
[1:27:25] somebody where they say dang nothing you
[1:27:27] can tell me that would change my mind
[1:27:29] because you didn't closed off every
[1:27:31] Avenue possible you've done closed off
[1:27:33] all avenues of communication you can't
[1:27:35] even have a conversation with somebody
[1:27:37] like that
[1:27:38] but when you got his Spirit it makes
[1:27:40] every emotion everything ticked just
[1:27:43] right to the word of God
[1:27:45] when Christ is there
[1:27:47] well Christ is there it makes bearing
[1:27:50] that cross a joy to bear
[1:27:54] I'll be closing in just a second
[1:27:57] brother said when the yoke is lined with
[1:27:59] a joy and peace and sweetness of Christ
[1:28:00] in your heart
[1:28:02] then you just pick up all the burdens
[1:28:04] the World cast on you and bear them to a
[1:28:06] certain Hill called Calvary and there
[1:28:08] you kneel down
[1:28:10] now here here's a real evidence of being
[1:28:13] born again
[1:28:14] and pray for the one that was
[1:28:16] persecuting you
[1:28:19] let's ask that question tonight this
[1:28:21] afternoon
[1:28:22] can you pray for somebody that you're
[1:28:25] real upset about
[1:28:27] somebody that you just they're just
[1:28:29] greats greats all your gears
[1:28:32] not rain fire out of heaven and tear up
[1:28:34] the church
[1:28:35] but you bring peace to them
[1:28:38] God be merciful to them
[1:28:41] you know when they ask Jesus how to pray
[1:28:44] and and Jesus said after this manner
[1:28:46] therefore pray ye Our Father which
[1:28:47] aren't in heaven Hallowed be thy name
[1:28:49] listen to this recipe that he gave us to
[1:28:51] pray
[1:28:52] thy kingdom come thy will be done and
[1:28:54] Earth as it is in heaven give us this
[1:28:56] day our daily bread and forgive us
[1:28:58] forgive us our deaths as we forgive our
[1:29:02] debtors
[1:29:04] brother Ram said forgiveness is tied in
[1:29:06] with faith
[1:29:08] because if you want your sins forgiven
[1:29:10] but you're not willing to forgive
[1:29:12] somebody else
[1:29:13] oh you've reached a stopping point
[1:29:16] I think that's why so many people reach
[1:29:18] a stopping point because what they do is
[1:29:19] they build up grievances in church they
[1:29:22] build up all this they've got all this
[1:29:24] stuff built up about why they don't like
[1:29:26] something and they don't think something
[1:29:27] should have been done certain way and
[1:29:29] they build up things and they are
[1:29:31] unwilling to forgive
[1:29:34] and Jesus said lead us not into
[1:29:36] temptation but Deliver Us from Evil for
[1:29:39] thine is the kingdom and the power and
[1:29:41] the glory forever and and ever
[1:29:45] it for if ye forgive men
[1:29:48] their trespasses
[1:29:50] your heavenly father will also forgive
[1:29:52] you
[1:29:54] but if you forgive not man their
[1:29:56] trespasses
[1:29:57] neither will your father forgive your
[1:30:00] trespasses
[1:30:01] now you see there there's something a
[1:30:04] power that's been given to the you
[1:30:06] realize you've got the power in your
[1:30:07] heart as a born-again believer
[1:30:10] to forgive somebody
[1:30:12] that you can let it go
[1:30:15] that when somebody does something to you
[1:30:17] that you don't like and just you don't
[1:30:20] have the right you're not treated the
[1:30:22] right way that you think in church
[1:30:23] you're not doing the right way you think
[1:30:26] everything is done wrong and you just
[1:30:28] build up all this bitterness
[1:30:30] you see
[1:30:31] you can't move forward until you let it
[1:30:34] go but a holy ghost-filled Christian has
[1:30:37] the power to Let It Go
[1:30:40] you've got the power to forgive your
[1:30:42] unjust boss at work
[1:30:44] you've got the power when you're not
[1:30:45] treated right to forgive them
[1:30:48] you got that power you've got the power
[1:30:51] to forgive the people at church that you
[1:30:53] go to church with
[1:30:54] that maybe didn't treat you right maybe
[1:30:56] didn't shake your hand shaking shaking
[1:30:58] your hand is the example we always use
[1:30:59] but you know it's usually not shaking
[1:31:02] hands if somebody says something to you
[1:31:04] or does something that that really uh
[1:31:06] man you go home and it Grieves you and
[1:31:09] vexes you but as long as you hang on to
[1:31:11] it you're the one that's suffering
[1:31:14] not them they might not even know but
[1:31:16] you hang on to it but God's given you
[1:31:19] the power to Let It Go as a Holy Ghost
[1:31:22] Field Christian how about this forgive
[1:31:25] forgive your unbelieving spouse maybe
[1:31:26] you got an unbelievable spouse here and
[1:31:28] you just you just got some bitterness
[1:31:30] built up but you've got the power to
[1:31:32] forgive them
[1:31:33] they they don't agree with the way that
[1:31:35] you want to raise your your kids or
[1:31:37] agree with the way that you want to
[1:31:38] conduct your life or maybe even the
[1:31:40] church you go to and it's just it's just
[1:31:42] giving you all kind of grief and maybe
[1:31:43] you build up a lot of bitterness and
[1:31:44] things
[1:31:46] but you can forgive
[1:31:48] yeah you can forgive
[1:31:50] you can forgive the preacher that hurt
[1:31:52] you
[1:31:53] now there's some the deacons that said
[1:31:56] something to your children and now you
[1:31:57] built it all up
[1:31:59] until you're grieving and you're
[1:32:01] grieving the Holy Spirit Away
[1:32:03] but you can forgive you can forgive why
[1:32:07] because you've been forgiven
[1:32:10] that's how you can forgive if you look
[1:32:12] back in your life and think about all
[1:32:14] the things that you've done wrong and
[1:32:16] all the grace that Believers have have
[1:32:18] given you and shown you and think about
[1:32:21] all the grace that God has shown you and
[1:32:23] think about all of that
[1:32:24] all that you've been guilty of
[1:32:28] that
[1:32:30] allows us to forgive
[1:32:32] you've got the ability the supernatural
[1:32:35] ability you know that's a supernatural
[1:32:37] ability that's got to be something
[1:32:39] Supernatural the world you know those
[1:32:41] co-workers you work with that are always
[1:32:42] complaining and they come to work and
[1:32:44] you know they have a horrible home life
[1:32:46] they don't have that same Supernatural
[1:32:49] ability because they've let it built up
[1:32:51] to a place where they just they're just
[1:32:53] grumpy to everybody they come they hit
[1:32:55] the ground running it worked grumpy that
[1:32:57] the coffee ain't made right everything's
[1:32:59] just not going their way but you are
[1:33:02] different because God has given you the
[1:33:04] ability to forgive
[1:33:06] why because God has moved in the Holy
[1:33:10] Spirit has moved in the Holy Spirit took
[1:33:12] the place of the beer can the Bible took
[1:33:14] the place of the modern day literature
[1:33:16] the spirit of God took the place of
[1:33:18] modern theology the prayer meeting
[1:33:20] returned to the home when the Holy
