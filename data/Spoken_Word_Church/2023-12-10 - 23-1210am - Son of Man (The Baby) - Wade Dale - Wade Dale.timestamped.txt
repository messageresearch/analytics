[36:52] together on that a little bit later so
[36:54] God bless you we love you with a love of
[36:55] the Lord thank you all for coming thank
[36:57] you all for participating this year is
[36:59] almost over uh who would have thought
[37:01] 2024 was coming up but we're here and
[37:05] we're here because not because God's
[37:07] slack it's because we're slack all right
[37:10] so we need to we need to to jump on it
[37:13] and get her done this year coming up I
[37:15] think that we're all getting
[37:17] older and um more and more ailments are
[37:20] hitting us and and some of you that are
[37:22] sick uh natural families been sick um
[37:26] there for a couple of days so just pray
[37:28] for them but we are pressing the battle
[37:32] we are not going to
[37:34] stop we're going to keep fighting we're
[37:37] going to fight like brother Brown said
[37:38] till your teeth fall out and when your
[37:40] teeth fall out we'll gum him to death
[37:42] all right so uh I I don't like the devil
[37:47] no I don't like him at
[37:48] all um also before we um finish up
[37:52] brother Bob had mentioned about this
[37:54] brother Abraham and I I have tried for a
[37:57] year to get him here uh he is a prophet
[38:00] but I tell you how he works uh because
[38:03] he has a gift and what he does is he
[38:04] sits down with the pastors and he'll
[38:06] discern what's going on in the church
[38:08] but he will not bring to the pull pit
[38:10] and see that's wisdom that's not that's
[38:12] not wisdom to come up here and start
[38:14] bashing people and you know and it's all
[38:16] been 100% true so I don't think he's a
[38:18] false prophet but he is considered a
[38:21] prophet in Africa and over here also but
[38:24] I have tried for a year and he's just so
[38:26] full
[38:27] to um and don't nobody get
[38:29] nervous that's all right but he discerns
[38:33] what goes on in the church and he'll
[38:34] tell the pastor and the pastor will work
[38:35] on it through through through the wisdom
[38:38] of the pastor he can he can you know he
[38:41] can massage it in the in the
[38:43] congregation and brother Chad Lamb and
[38:45] different ones that's had him have told
[38:46] us that was how he worked and that's the
[38:49] that's the way it should work so we do
[38:51] believe in prophets I pray that I was in
[38:53] there with when brother Bob was speaking
[38:55] I said Lord s send one in America send
[38:58] one here we can use here even in this
[39:00] local assembly because we need all
[39:02] five-fold ministry right to keep the
[39:04] church clean ain't that what it's
[39:05] supposed to do to keep Church clean all
[39:07] right so let's don't get nervous kind
[39:09] like that marriage and divorce you start
[39:10] talking about prophets and marriage and
[39:12] divorce and people
[39:13] start you're
[39:17] shutting but we do we're humans today
[39:20] we're going to still be on the son of
[39:22] man it's not going to be part 140
[39:23] whatever it is but we're going to talk
[39:25] about the baby
[39:27] all right cuz there was a baby born we
[39:29] know he wasn't born December 25th we
[39:31] know he's born in April just all like
[39:33] all Lambs are born but we
[39:35] do uh you know the prophet of God um he
[39:38] had services around Christmas and he he
[39:41] preached on God's wrapped gift he
[39:44] preached on why it had to be Shepherds
[39:46] he preached on why little Bethlehem so I
[39:49] believe that he around the time of that
[39:52] year he entered into not the festivities
[39:54] like the world does but he did we've all
[39:57] got our minds on that so so let's speak
[39:59] on a little bit we talk about the son of
[40:01] man as the as the grown man but let's
[40:04] talk about the son of man the baby today
[40:05] maybe it'll help you because it helped
[40:07] me when I was talk uh when I was working
[40:09] on it to kind of weave this in so like I
[40:12] said Lord bless you we'll be finished in
[40:14] a little while we'll go to baptismal
[40:15] service everybody's invited there will
[40:17] be uh excuse me a full catered meal for
[40:22] everyone plenty of food for you to eat
[40:25] and then we'll have some uh some gifts
[40:27] for the officers and uh and and
[40:29] different ones and you'll all get one
[40:32] today after service don't rush out of
[40:34] here real quick cuz there's an envelope
[40:36] for every one of you that pays TI than
[40:38] go to church here okay so all right
[40:42] we've done that for a long time Brother

[40:48] tradition Lord willing so let's bow our
[40:50] heads dear heavenly father Lord thank

[41:49] newness of life as the scripture says
[41:51] and walks with you father just bless
[41:53] each one now in Jesus name amen and
[41:56] we're going to use the same scripture
[41:57] because in the beginning was the word
[41:59] word was with God and the Word was God
[42:00] the same was in the beginning with God
[42:02] all things were made by him and for
[42:05] him right and there wasn't anything
[42:08] made without him that's right nothing
[42:12] all right but he had to become a
[42:14] baby all right he had to become a baby
[42:17] because he had to become one of us
[42:18] that's right and that word was made
[42:20] flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld
[42:22] his glory The Glory by God and Father
[42:24] full of grace and truth and brother
[42:25] colie your outfit looks
[42:28] good none of y'all say his outfit looks
[42:30] good none of y'all did I think it looks
[42:32] good all right y'all can sit down
[42:36] now talk about somebody's
[42:40] clothesall the older I get the less I
[42:42] less important it is right brother Kylie
[42:44] I just figure out if I can get here I'm
[42:47] good right brother Dy he say
[42:49] Amen so let's remember these things and
[42:52] and let's just talk a little bit I know
[42:54] it's hot in here the on but I don't know
[42:56] if the Air's on see if you can click it
[42:59] down to the air and
[43:01] U so let's look real quick here we are
[43:04] today and we're remember the son of man
[43:06] had to have a a beginning as we were
[43:08] talking about the other day the
[43:10] dispensations we know God is a
[43:12] dispensationalist and so was brother
[43:13] brandham and so are we we believe in
[43:15] dispensation how God takes one group of
[43:17] people sends somebody to that group of
[43:19] people does a specific work and then
[43:22] moves to the next dispensation as we see
[43:25] in the ch Church ages and as we see with
[43:28] these virtues add this and add that add
[43:30] this and add that all right everybody
[43:32] with
[43:32] me but now before that there was even a
[43:37] star or anything was this was this
[43:39] person and we explained it the other
[43:41] week with the with the jar and the water
[43:44] and there was this person there and he's
[43:45] the person of of God and Jehovah and
[43:48] logos and all those different words but
[43:52] Jesus Christ had not come in form yet to
[43:55] be our brother
[43:56] all right so we couldn't understand him
[43:59] as this God over
[44:01] here okay but now I can understand a God
[44:05] that can be birthed like you and I are
[44:07] birth without the sex part but we can be
[44:09] he can be birthed he can be birthed not
[44:12] in a beautiful hospital that's air
[44:14] conditioning and all the lights and they
[44:16] got all the music playing and no he was
[44:18] born in a in a in a stable in a barn uh
[44:22] stinky barn and and the swaddling
[44:24] clothes he was wrapped in they is the
[44:26] old uh cloth that goes around the ox
[44:28] neck so it probably was a little sweaty
[44:31] so but that was our God that he could do
[44:33] that but it was promised in Isaiah 7:14
[44:36] say therefore the Lord himself have you
[44:38] give you a sign so he's going to give
[44:40] you a sign a virgin shall conceive and
[44:42] bear a son and shall call his name
[44:45] Emmanuel all right now that interpreted
[44:48] is what God With Us CU we'll read in
[44:49] Matthew
[44:51] 1:8 now the birth of Jesus Christ was on
[44:53] this wise now here we see the birth of
[44:56] something coming and a name given
[44:59] everybody with me all right be with me
[45:02] for a minute here you you got you got
[45:04] Jehovah you got Rose of Sharon lily of
[45:06] the valley bright and Morning Star and
[45:08] you've got um employee you've got person
[45:11] you've got a grandpa you've got right
[45:14] but there's a name to that now when you
[45:15] bring to that name as we were talking
[45:17] about a few weeks ago the true name of
[45:20] of God is Jesus Christ amen cuz God's
[45:23] not a name Jehovah's not a name he had
[45:25] to have a name cuz you know what you got
[45:27] a name you have a name that you're
[45:29] specified that is you and that's your
[45:32] name and as as brother Joe said we're
[45:34] predestinated to come to this point
[45:36] right here and God knows what name and
[45:39] whatever name if we get another name
[45:40] over there guess what it won't be
[45:43] secret so secret nobody will know you
[45:46] listen when we get over to the other
[45:47] side we'll know each other and won't
[45:49] have to
[45:50] go I remember you no you'll know their
[45:54] name amen
[45:56] but your name today is specified with
[45:58] how you are and your character so this
[46:01] guy named Jesus Christ had a character
[46:03] all right everybody with me now the
[46:05] birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise
[46:07] when his mother Mary was a spouse to
[46:09] Joseph before they came together in
[46:11] other words before they became husband
[46:13] and wife as far as consummation she was
[46:17] found with child now look of what of the
[46:20] Holy Ghost now what wait what what whoa
[46:22] whoa whoa that's the dispensation over
[46:24] here in the Old Testament
[46:26] he was above the people not in the
[46:28] people he was above the people all right
[46:31] so now God's going to change that
[46:32] dispensation dispensation instead of
[46:34] being God above us he's going to be God
[46:37] with us so he's going to what he's going
[46:39] to he's going to imorph
[46:42] himself into a the spirit of God called
[46:45] the Holy Ghost and he's going to create
[46:48] listen the Holy Ghost was the creator
[46:50] all right everybody with me and they
[46:54] knew in the in the New Testament just a
[46:55] to save time so it won't be so long they
[46:58] knew in the old in the New Testament
[47:00] you're the Creator something inside of
[47:02] you created all things good to have
[47:04] Benjamin with us today did you fly
[47:07] in no he did oh you didn't fly yourself
[47:10] though not
[47:12] yet nope you didn't fly he's working on
[47:15] his pilot license so we're
[47:18] waiting she was found with child of the
[47:21] Holy Ghost so the Holy Ghost was God in
[47:24] what in a form that we can understand
[47:27] that the Holy Ghost is going to
[47:28] overshadow this virgin and create as he
[47:31] created before cuz remember we've been
[47:33] talking about the beginning of the
[47:34] creation of God and we're going to read
[47:36] that in just a minute because this is
[47:38] where the creation of God began Amen in
[47:41] the womb of a woman all right not by sex
[47:44] but by Spoken Word the Holy Ghost
[47:47] overshadowed Mary didn't give her the
[47:50] Holy Ghost come on somebody she had to
[47:52] go to the upper room to get it everybody
[47:54] with me that didn't didn't give her the
[47:56] Holy Ghost but there was an act that
[47:58] happened in eternity right
[48:02] amen there was an act that happened in
[48:05] eternity cuz God can't change his mind
[48:07] so he came down as the Holy Ghost and
[48:09] through a a messenger Gabriel said
[48:12] you're going to have a child by the Holy
[48:14] Ghost and she's going to she's like
[48:17] she's 16 or 17 years old and we know
[48:19] Joseph was a lot older and and I'm sure
[48:21] he scratched his head cuz he didn't know
[48:23] anybody that had been born that way
[48:25] before
[48:26] and and I I want y'all to spiritualize
[48:28] this a little bit in your life cuz this
[48:30] is how you receive the Holy
[48:34] Ghost listen God can overshadow you
[48:38] that's an
[48:39] anointing but that Holy Ghost has to go
[48:42] inside you yes right that Holy Ghost had
[48:44] to create something and go inside of
[48:46] Mary literally in her womb and just plop
[48:49] it down right there and her body took
[48:51] over and what nourished it but by God
[48:55] what he said before he said every seed
[48:57] will bring forth of its kind so it's
[48:59] going to have to do it but he had to
[49:01] place it in there it wasn't placed in
[49:03] there by Joseph now remember Joseph and
[49:05] Mary had many many children afterwards
[49:07] James and different ones you you read
[49:09] that there was different ones that that
[49:11] were born but but Jesus was born
[49:13] different he was born he was had the
[49:16] Holy Ghost he didn't have to receive it
[49:18] on the River Jordan we'll talk about
[49:20] that in just a minute but in symbol he
[49:23] did listen you can't ask anything to God
[49:27] you can't add to the fullness of the
[49:29] godhead
[49:29] bodily he came here his spirit and his
[49:33] soul was almighty God are the Bible's
[49:35] wrong because right here it
[49:37] says his name Shall be Called Emmanuel
[49:41] which is God With Us not God coming to
[49:43] be with us in another person he came his
[49:46] own self in his own person but he came
[49:49] in a human flesh that was not perfect
[49:52] that was not Eternal cuz that's the same
[49:54] way with you right I'll read it here in
[49:57] just a minute where brother rown said
[49:58] God gives you when you're born a spirit
[50:00] and a
[50:01] soul only God can do that Satan can
[50:04] pervert what you got and he will do that
[50:07] that's what we call coming to the age of
[50:09] accountability we'll see that in just a
[50:10] minute but Jesus didn't have to come to
[50:12] the age of accountability but he did
[50:14] have to come to a place where we've been
[50:15] reading it for the past three weeks
[50:17] where he grew in Grace and knowledge
[50:19] that's right and being made perfect what
[50:22] this yes right he was subject to man he
[50:26] was subject to his Earthly mother and
[50:28] father when they caught him at 13 in the
[50:30] temple not caught him but found him in
[50:32] the temple doing what his father said he
[50:35] wasn't building cabinets he was
[50:37] preaching the word of God right but what
[50:41] you know he didn't you know what he
[50:42] didn't do I'll guarantee you that boy at
[50:44] 13 years old he didn't say well bless
[50:46] God I'm God and I don't have to do what
[50:49] y'all say no the Bible says after he
[50:51] made that statement that he was subject
[50:54] unto them amen right during that time
[50:56] even knowing he was God even knowing he
[50:58] was born different he was special he
[51:00] honored his father and mother that was
[51:02] on the earth and I put in quotation
[51:03] marks because Mary wasn't his say mother
[51:07] as far as birth mother as far as sexual
[51:09] birth mother all right St by with me all
[51:11] right so she was found with a child of
[51:13] the Holy Ghost and Joseph her husband
[51:15] being just man not willing to make her a
[51:17] public example was minded to put away
[51:20] priv but while he thought on these
[51:22] things look behold an angel of the Lord
[51:23] appearing to him cuz listen if you
[51:25] Ponder something in your heart anybody
[51:28] anybody you Ponder something in your
[51:29] heart and you're serious about it and
[51:31] you're serious about the situation and
[51:34] you're serious about what's going on and
[51:36] you're a
[51:37] Christian God's going to send you
[51:40] somebody he may not send you Gabriel he
[51:43] may send you by
[51:45] black
[51:48] luiso A
[51:50] Roberts he may send those guys by as an
[51:54] angel or a messenger
[51:56] to say hey Joseph it's okay buddy it's
[51:58] all
[51:59] right God's got this in control that's
[52:02] what we got to do we got to we got to
[52:04] let you know Joseph didn't say well I
[52:05] got to figure this thing out no he
[52:07] didn't figure it out he just did what
[52:09] the guy said th son of David fear not to
[52:12] take unto thee marry thy wife for that
[52:13] which is conceived in her is of the Holy
[52:16] Ghost all right and I am sure now I want
[52:18] to ask you a question where did that
[52:20] word Holy Ghost develop from cuz if if
[52:23] it was all in the Old Testament that was
[52:25] never mentioned it was always Jehovah
[52:28] God it was always Jehovah Jehovah now we
[52:30] see this new word come into this part of
[52:33] the Old Testament that he says you this
[52:37] guy's going to be uh born by the Holy
[52:39] Ghost well that's a revelation to Joseph
[52:41] and Joseph says hey this must be
[52:43] something new I know it's God I know I'm
[52:46] reading Isaiah 7 I read Isaiah 9 I'm
[52:48] reading all these different ones is this
[52:51] it and I'm sure the Angels go yeah this
[52:54] is it right you do what I tell you to do
[52:57] come on somebody you do what I tell you
[52:59] to do be sincere about it Joseph was
[53:02] sincere cuz he had a problem amen he had
[53:05] a wife that was
[53:07] pregnant and he had nothing to do with
[53:10] it so he was going to put her away and
[53:13] let her you know hide her somewhere used
[53:16] to a long time ago that's the same way
[53:18] um many many years ago if a girl got
[53:21] pregnant she disappeared for a while
[53:23] what she went somewhere to some aunt's
[53:24] house or uncle's house and right because
[53:27] it was a shameful thing now you just
[53:28] bringing anywhere you want to and she
[53:31] shall bring forth a son and thou shalt
[53:32] call his name Jesus now here is
[53:36] Joseph got a name to call him now right
[53:39] for he shall save his people from their
[53:41] sins now all this was done that it might
[53:43] be fulfilled which was spoken by the
[53:45] Lord by the prophet saying Behold a
[53:46] virgin shall conceive which is Isaiah we
[53:48] just read and shall bring forth a son
[53:50] and they shall call his name Emmanuel
[53:52] which being interpreted is God With Us
[53:55] yeah
[53:55] not part God all of God the fullness of
[53:58] the godhead body that's what we've been
[53:59] talking about the Statue of perfect man
[54:01] The Headstone listen as a baby sure he
[54:05] developed as a human being but he was
[54:08] almighty
[54:09] God he didn't have to become
[54:12] God if he become God I need to find the
[54:15] other guy that was born
[54:17] virgin come on I need to find him cuz
[54:20] he's the one that saved me not the other
[54:22] one Luke 1:30 says the angel said her
[54:25] fear not Mary for thou H has found favor
[54:28] with God how many of you today would
[54:29] like to have an angel come and say fear
[54:31] not you found favor with god well if
[54:34] you'll listen on Wednesday and Sunday
[54:35] and and press play every once in a while
[54:38] God's telling you I found favor with you
[54:40] remember I told you if you're born again
[54:42] today God says I am pleased to dwell in
[54:45] you just like he did on the River Jordan
[54:49] and behold Thou shalt conceive in thy
[54:50] womb and bring forth a son and shall
[54:53] call his name Jesus he shall shall be
[54:55] great and shall be called the son of the
[54:57] highest now remember there were many
[54:59] jesuses in that day that was a common
[55:01] name he wasn't the only Jesus has ever
[55:04] lived okay he shall be great and shall
[55:07] be called the son of the highest and the
[55:08] Lord God shall give unto him the Throne
[55:10] of his father David but here is his here
[55:13] is what's attached to that
[55:15] child Mary knows he he's he's something
[55:19] special and as brother R say she had to
[55:22] wait at least a month to know she is
[55:25] pregnant everybody know your sisters
[55:27] know what I'm talking about and he shall
[55:29] reign over the house of Jacob forever
[55:30] and of his kingdom there shall be no end
[55:34] that's why we were talking about the
[55:35] other day the son of David there's his
[55:36] promise give him the Throne of his
[55:39] father David so he'll be on the throne
[55:41] now and forever through the Millennium
[55:44] and all the way through but he at at
[55:45] that time though now he picks up a bride
[55:48] which is us he come to get a bride he
[55:51] came as a baby to save the people sure
[55:54] but he came to get me you cuz you and I
[55:57] were inside
[56:00] that we were inside that child
[56:03] amen if not you're not part of God
[56:06] that's right so where because where' you
[56:07] come from your eternal life came from
[56:10] that
[56:11] guy now as a baby he couldn't die for
[56:15] you but he sure did have eternal life
[56:18] inside of him I'll promise you that if
[56:19] he didn't like I said we need to find
[56:21] that guy cuz he's the one that's going
[56:22] to save you not the one that born like
[56:25] me and you cuz we born dead right he was
[56:29] born to die you and I were born
[56:33] Dead come on
[56:34] somebody then Mary said unto the angel
[56:37] how shall this be seeing I know not a
[56:39] man the angel answered and said unto her
[56:41] the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and
[56:44] the power of the high shall overshadow
[56:47] thee in other words come upon you with
[56:49] an anointing but not just with an
[56:50] anointing we're going to drop something
[56:52] in a place right and everybody with me
[56:55] we're going to drop something in a place
[56:57] because
[56:58] listen in our natural birth there's
[57:01] something dropped in a place is
[57:02] everybody with me right in a natural
[57:04] birth but it's placed by a man and a
[57:07] woman together this is going to be
[57:08] placed by God which is the beginning of
[57:10] the creation God which is spoken word
[57:13] nothing no desire no sexual desire
[57:15] that's why Jesus didn't have a carnal
[57:17] mind you and I have a carnal mind cuz we
[57:20] know where we came from and our mama
[57:21] came from and our daddy came from and
[57:23] our sister came from and we all know
[57:24] that
[57:26] that's why that's why Paul said first
[57:28] thing he says we need to mind of Christ
[57:30] sir we need to take that carnal mind to
[57:32] get rid of it right listen you can't
[57:35] deny your first birth I'm looking at
[57:40] it but there's something in a second
[57:42] birth we'll talk about in just a minute
[57:44] that will take care of that first birth
[57:47] amen you believe
[57:49] that therefore that Holy thing which
[57:53] shall be born in thee shall be called
[57:56] The Son of God so that was what the Holy
[57:58] Ghost the Son of God in that
[58:00] dispensation he's coming to dwell inside
[58:03] but when you put that Son of God in
[58:04] human flesh he becomes what the son of
[58:07] man all
[58:09] right believe us thou this brother R
[58:11] said look we're not born into that into
[58:14] that by his righteous Holy Blood without
[58:17] sexual desire he died at Calvary given
[58:19] his blood that we could be free from sin
[58:21] brother you believe that if you don't
[58:23] you're lost
[58:25] that's all because it's in the blood
[58:27] we're saved by the blood of God now
[58:28] brother R later on he says you're not
[58:30] saved by the blood you're kept saved by
[58:32] the blood but we are that listen in that
[58:36] baby flowed no DNA from a man on Earth
[58:39] he was literally a
[58:41] Superman he came from another planet
[58:44] called eternity called Heaven all
[58:48] right why do you think all the world is
[58:50] trying to emulate all that Superman this
[58:52] man this guy this this guy's got some
[58:54] kind of superpower but they all have one
[58:56] flaw Kryptonite and all the other things
[58:59] you know we don't listen we got one that
[59:01] don't have it he's a mighty conqueror he
[59:04] conquered everything death hell and the
[59:05] grave took it all with him and gave it
[59:08] back to me and you we'll read that here
[59:09] in just a second so Jesus was the blood
[59:11] of his father which was holy
[59:15] unadulterated blood not by sexual desire
[59:18] but by Holy Ghost was he born conceived
[59:21] in the womb of Mary and was born I
[59:23] believe that with all
[59:25] my heart Revelations 3:14 we've been
[59:28] reading this because remember he's The
[59:30] Headstone but he had to become the
[59:32] Cornerstone he had to become a baby he
[59:34] had to he had to come like me and you so
[59:36] that we can understand him and
[59:37] understand his life and look at him and
[59:39] and see where where we miss it out right
[59:42] and to the angel of the Church of the
[59:44] loud of sins which is today these things
[59:46] sayith the amen the faithful and true
[59:48] witness we were talking about that word
[59:49] true the beginning of the creation of
[59:52] God that sounds kind of that sounds kind
[59:54] of Str strange how can God have a
[59:57] beginning well brother R said he had a
[59:59] beginning in the womb of a woman right
[1:00:03] that's the way he wanted to be in the
[1:00:05] first
[1:00:07] place Revelations chapter 4 Listen to
[1:00:10] What brother R said he says remember a
[1:00:12] couple of Sundays ago we got to it the
[1:00:13] big diamond cutting many different ways
[1:00:15] to reflect the fire and light from one
[1:00:18] that's the way Jesus Christ is the
[1:00:19] beginning of the creation of God
[1:00:22] Revelations 1 he means sorry he means
[1:00:25] Revelation 3:14 but Revelations 1 is
[1:00:27] that right then when was God created
[1:00:30] he's the beginning of the creation of
[1:00:31] God and God is eternal is that right but
[1:00:33] when God was created when a little baby
[1:00:36] that was conceived in the womb of a
[1:00:38] mother a
[1:00:39] virgin that's when he
[1:00:42] began and she began to develop these C
[1:00:45] within her to bring forth this little
[1:00:47] baby that was the beginning of God's
[1:00:50] creation for God was made flesh and
[1:00:53] dwelt Among Us and became imman God will
[1:00:55] us the beginning of the creation of
[1:00:58] God then in him that great Jewel that
[1:01:00] comes from the dust cuz he was made of
[1:01:03] dust he eat food like I do he eat feed
[1:01:06] like food like you do which dust of the
[1:01:07] body he became calcium potach petroleum
[1:01:09] Cosmic light but in him dwelt Eternal
[1:01:13] Light there was no darkness in him at
[1:01:17] all you and I different story no wonder
[1:01:20] the wise men said guide us to thy
[1:01:22] Perfect Light they were just reflecting
[1:01:25] the light of one Perfect Light and there
[1:01:27] he was the perfect light of God
[1:01:30] beginning of the creation of God and his
[1:01:33] brother R says I didn't bring the quote
[1:01:34] for save for time he said and you're the
[1:01:37] continuation of that creation cuz you
[1:01:39] can't help it how you got here but you
[1:01:41] can help it how you leave here amen you
[1:01:45] can't help it how you got here but you
[1:01:47] sure can help how you leave here sir all
[1:01:49] right God perfecting his church 1954
[1:01:53] then the next time God was manifested
[1:01:55] was in his son Christ Jesus and then he
[1:01:58] came through a virgin birth conceived by
[1:02:01] a Virgin overshadowed by the Holy
[1:02:03] Spirit God himself came down into a
[1:02:06] blood cell and wrapped the blood around
[1:02:09] him the blood cell The Germ of Life Of
[1:02:12] God
[1:02:14] himself wrapped this blood cell that
[1:02:16] brought forth the sun Christ Jesus I'm
[1:02:19] reading everybody still believe brother
[1:02:20] B was a prophet all those you that
[1:02:23] awake okay
[1:02:25] those of you sleep just say Amen when
[1:02:26] you get shook somebody shake you say
[1:02:28] Amen cuz I do believe brother Brown was
[1:02:30] a prophet he's our Prophet all right now
[1:02:33] what he did does by that look to make
[1:02:36] you perfect and bring you back into
[1:02:40] Fellowship he brings you through that
[1:02:42] blood cell into himself you get it
[1:02:45] through the blood cell of the Lord Jesus
[1:02:47] that inail the life of
[1:02:50] Jehovah there's your identification he
[1:02:53] was Jehovah the old test test Jesus of
[1:02:55] the new because he didn't pick up a
[1:02:57] different life when he come down here
[1:03:00] we're going to explain that here in just
[1:03:01] a few minutes all right cuz you and I
[1:03:05] did he didn't pick up a life he was
[1:03:10] life and we've come through the blood
[1:03:13] cell becomes a part of what that life so
[1:03:16] listen if any part of Jesus had a
[1:03:18] beginning except his body then we need
[1:03:21] to find somebody that didn't cuz we got
[1:03:23] to attach ourselves to that we got to
[1:03:25] attach oursel to something that's
[1:03:26] Eternal all
[1:03:28] right so deity itself whoo
[1:03:34] stop
[1:03:35] who no that's only
[1:03:38] God that maybe brother
[1:03:41] BR deity itself lays in a man that's
[1:03:43] received the Holy
[1:03:45] Spirit you are a son I'm a Brandon by
[1:03:48] birth and a part of Mr M brandom is in
[1:03:50] me and if you becoming s son and
[1:03:52] daughter of God part of deity lays in
[1:03:55] you praise the Lord give him a hand
[1:03:59] clap
[1:04:01] deity one God deity is one God yes right
[1:04:05] and the form of the Holy Ghost is inside
[1:04:07] of you but now listen when that comes
[1:04:09] into the form of you come on
[1:04:13] somebody you become the
[1:04:16] bride and that's his last and morphe
[1:04:18] here on Earth with the Gentiles is in a
[1:04:19] bride yes everybody with me all right
[1:04:22] 1961 do you ever noticed a little baby
[1:04:26] when it was born it little muscles
[1:04:27] twitching and
[1:04:28] jerking but when it comes to the earth
[1:04:31] now watch this it receives a spirit and
[1:04:33] then it becomes a living Soul now listen
[1:04:36] and as soon as that Soul goes back from
[1:04:38] that little body there's another one
[1:04:40] waiting for it all right hold on because
[1:04:43] first God makes the soul in spirit and
[1:04:47] it goes to the body all right so you get
[1:04:51] a soul and a spirit now listen you get a
[1:04:53] soul that's created by
[1:04:55] God perfect but not
[1:04:58] Eternal cuz God can't make anything
[1:05:01] imperfect everybody with me all right
[1:05:03] he's the only one can give life Satan
[1:05:05] cannot give life he can only pervert
[1:05:06] what God's already made all
[1:05:08] right because first God makes the Soul
[1:05:12] and Spirit it just goes to the bodies
[1:05:15] and when we leave here we only change
[1:05:17] Dwelling Places and go to another now we
[1:05:21] are we know in this church there's one
[1:05:23] thing for sure I don't have a theophany
[1:05:25] over there hanging up in a closet in
[1:05:26] heaven
[1:05:29] right I'm looking at it right now well
[1:05:33] wait a minute I'm looking at the
[1:05:35] Shell that is
[1:05:37] in cuz if there's another body over
[1:05:39] there brother BR didn't believe in
[1:05:40] transmigration of souls he didn't
[1:05:42] believe a a soul can move to another
[1:05:44] body come on
[1:05:45] somebody it's being built right
[1:05:49] here and when we leave here we only
[1:05:51] change Dwelling Places and go to another
[1:05:53] for this Earth Tabernacle be dissolved
[1:05:55] we have one already waiting so that's
[1:05:57] our
[1:05:59] consolation comforter 1961 so it's just
[1:06:02] like a little baby when a little baby is
[1:06:04] conceived in the mother's womb it's just
[1:06:06] flesh and blood and jumping quivering
[1:06:08] but as soon as it's born you don't see
[1:06:11] it but there's a spirit and soul hanging
[1:06:13] near that mother to come into that baby
[1:06:16] just as soon as it's
[1:06:19] born so the holy
[1:06:22] ghost man Mary the Holy Ghost put a seed
[1:06:26] and a and a egg inside of Mary's
[1:06:29] womb and he just hung around for about
[1:06:32] nine
[1:06:33] months and went right back
[1:06:38] in but
[1:06:40] remember our spirit by nature is
[1:06:43] Fallen our soul is
[1:06:46] perfect but not Eternal you make your
[1:06:49] decision in your soul you don't make
[1:06:50] your decision in your spirit righten
[1:06:53] hello
[1:06:55] somebody Faith or doubt that's it you
[1:06:59] make your decision in your soul it
[1:07:01] emanates out into your spirit and then
[1:07:04] all your body does is does what the
[1:07:06] inside tells them to
[1:07:08] do listen there's nothing wrong with
[1:07:10] your flesh it's what's inside of it's
[1:07:14] wrong oh I sin in my flesh no you don't
[1:07:17] you s yeah you sin in your flesh with
[1:07:19] your flesh but not not motivated by your
[1:07:22] flesh your flesh has no mo ation except
[1:07:25] what's on the inside all right the
[1:07:27] spirit that's why all babies go to
[1:07:29] heaven now look I'm going show you right
[1:07:31] here mother it comes into that baby just
[1:07:34] soon as it's born so when a baby's born
[1:07:36] and thank God for a prophet that that if
[1:07:39] it uh many people are asking questions
[1:07:42] about abortions and different things
[1:07:44] well if you go by what brother Brown
[1:07:47] said unless that baby is born and starts
[1:07:48] breathing air it's not a
[1:07:51] soul he said it's wiggling muscles just
[1:07:54] like an animal right right yeah the only
[1:07:57] difference in Us in an animal brother
[1:07:58] George is God puts a soul in there for
[1:08:00] us to make a
[1:08:02] choice it's from God it's not
[1:08:05] nature we have a nature attached to that
[1:08:09] but he just when I I think many times
[1:08:11] you know we like to deer hunt and
[1:08:13] different things and and it's taking of
[1:08:15] a life but it's not taking of a of an
[1:08:17] eternal life for it's not taking of a
[1:08:18] life that has to be judged uh and God
[1:08:21] told us we can do it all right but I
[1:08:23] always wonder what happens you know when
[1:08:25] they close their eyes here they just go
[1:08:27] away cuz there's no place for them to
[1:08:30] go
[1:08:32] yeah God preserve them I believe and
[1:08:36] there'll be all kind of animals there
[1:08:37] that we won't have to kill but when you
[1:08:40] close your
[1:08:41] eyes when you pass away and you close
[1:08:44] your eyes you go to a place whether it
[1:08:47] be Heaven or Hell not the same I'm
[1:08:48] talking about the fifth and sixth
[1:08:49] Dimension you going to go somewhere and
[1:08:52] guess what's going to happen you come in
[1:08:53] right back
[1:08:55] here to make a choice the deer don't
[1:08:58] have to it don't have a soul it has a
[1:09:00] spirit though a nature about it so
[1:09:03] listen to this just as soon as that
[1:09:05] baby is born God has created look God
[1:09:09] has created a soul and created a spirit
[1:09:13] to be in that baby just soon as it's
[1:09:15] born in this
[1:09:19] world God sends an angel where it be
[1:09:22] whatever you want to say he sends a
[1:09:23] birth Angel down with a a little ball of
[1:09:27] light hey if brother round can tell
[1:09:29] story so can
[1:09:30] I how do you think it happens it just
[1:09:32] floats in like this and floats back out
[1:09:34] like this no I believe God listen
[1:09:36] there's death
[1:09:38] Angels there's cheram serams there's
[1:09:40] altar Angels there's all kind of angels
[1:09:43] God sends an angel down with this little
[1:09:45] ball of light and as soon as Donnie fall
[1:09:46] Bush was born 70 something years ago
[1:09:49] good
[1:09:50] grief at least I didn't say
[1:09:52] you
[1:09:56] he and he becomes a what a living soul
[1:10:00] but now look living but
[1:10:03] dead Jesus Christ was the same way the
[1:10:06] Holy Ghost overshadowed Mary put the
[1:10:09] product in and then when that baby was
[1:10:11] born by the power of God he entered that
[1:10:15] baby now listen he may have made your
[1:10:18] soul and your spirit but he didn't enter
[1:10:20] your soul or enter your spirit right he
[1:10:24] made one and gave it to you because that
[1:10:27] makes you an individual that makes you
[1:10:29] where you got to make a choice oh I
[1:10:32] always was eternal if you had eternal
[1:10:34] life you did but you w nothing but dead
[1:10:35] when you was
[1:10:36] born that's what I believe about
[1:10:39] Redemption it's not replacement it's
[1:10:42] bringing back that which fail what fell
[1:10:44] you fell in your
[1:10:46] soul just as soon as that baby is born
[1:10:49] God has created a soul and created a
[1:10:51] spirit to be in that baby just as soon
[1:10:53] as it's born born in the earth that
[1:10:54] little baby look becomes mature now
[1:10:57] watch that little baby becomes mature
[1:10:59] now what what we're talking about we're
[1:11:00] talking about the New Birth I'm going to
[1:11:01] talk about that in just a second ago
[1:11:02] that's what happens to me and you all
[1:11:04] right now listen he doesn't take your
[1:11:06] soul out and put his soul in at a new
[1:11:08] birth cuz that's the
[1:11:10] exchange no you are who you are God just
[1:11:13] burns out that old nature and puts
[1:11:14] himself inside of you all right praise
[1:11:17] the Lord I just believe that's the way
[1:11:18] it is I don't believe I was some super
[1:11:20] something when I was doing all that
[1:11:22] wrong and sinning if you do then God
[1:11:24] help
[1:11:25] you cuz you were lost brother BR said he
[1:11:28] was lost brother Bram said he used to
[1:11:30] sit and watch people go to church and
[1:11:32] and people don't like you to say this he
[1:11:35] said he washed his car on Sunday and
[1:11:37] watched people go to church a prophet
[1:11:39] why he wasn't born again it wasn't
[1:11:42] quickened if it was quickened to him
[1:11:44] he'd been in
[1:11:46] church I'm not going to say that no
[1:11:49] more it's Quicken to you you'll be in
[1:11:51] church I said it again then it became a
[1:11:54] living Soul listen listen when it knows
[1:11:57] what's right and wrong right then it's
[1:12:00] got just like Adam and Eve set before a
[1:12:02] tree of right and wrong why would he set
[1:12:04] a tree of right and wrong if you always
[1:12:05] was eternal in your
[1:12:07] soul you always were Eternal in God
[1:12:11] yes and he puts that Soul inside of you
[1:12:14] at a new birth yes it makes it
[1:12:18] Choice and then it
[1:12:21] becomes intelligent
[1:12:24] it grows all the time in God's Great
[1:12:26] economy and finally it comes down to the
[1:12:29] end of the road for this physical body
[1:12:30] now watch he takes you all through life
[1:12:32] and then here at the end of the road and
[1:12:34] just as this body is deteriorating and
[1:12:36] going away why cuz it was born in sin it
[1:12:39] was a product of sin but your flesh
[1:12:42] don't make you a
[1:12:47] sinner your flesh is not going to be
[1:12:50] judged amen your Soul's going to be
[1:12:53] judged judged your flesh is just going
[1:12:55] to be something there's attached to it
[1:12:57] that's right all right cuz remember if
[1:12:59] your flesh body goes to hell and starts
[1:13:02] burning as we call burning
[1:13:04] hell it' burn up in just a couple hours
[1:13:06] and be done with but it's not it's that
[1:13:08] Soul that's inside of you that's right
[1:13:11] everybody with
[1:13:12] me and just as this body is
[1:13:14] deteriorating and going away there's one
[1:13:16] being prepared to receive
[1:13:20] it where's it being
[1:13:22] prepared inside of you today amen inside
[1:13:27] of you today it's everybody say amen
[1:13:30] amen that's way it ought to sound just
[1:13:32] as soon it leaves
[1:13:34] here brother Donnie says if you're going
[1:13:36] to nod nod a little
[1:13:39] louder just as soon as it leaves here
[1:13:42] now look the soul that's in us now and
[1:13:44] this Spirit leaves this body and goes to
[1:13:46] another we know that a younger one but
[1:13:48] it just IM morphes out of this one
[1:13:50] because we can't take this one into that
[1:13:52] Dimension amen
[1:13:54] this body can't go into that Dimension
[1:13:56] it's
[1:13:57] slow and gets old and we can't go into
[1:14:01] that Dimension brother George cuz we're
[1:14:02] barred from that cuz that Dimension
[1:14:05] you're going to is without sin but your
[1:14:09] soul as soon as you die it go you don't
[1:14:11] have to open the door to let anybody
[1:14:16] out just like Jesus when he appeared to
[1:14:21] the disciples they didn't open the door
[1:14:23] he appeared through the
[1:14:24] wall in a flesh
[1:14:27] body but we don't take our flesh cuz our
[1:14:29] flesh was born wrong our flesh was born
[1:14:32] wrong so it can't go into that perfect
[1:14:34] Dimension but what you're building here
[1:14:36] today yes what you're building today
[1:14:39] goes into that Dimension either that one
[1:14:41] or that one five or
[1:14:44] six just as soon as it leaves here this
[1:14:46] Soul that's in us now the spirit leaves
[1:14:48] his body and goes to another younger one
[1:14:50] a good one a better one the one that
[1:14:52] won't get old or one that won't pass
[1:14:53] away he's a good god certainly is 1

[1:15:55] liveth yes all this world thinks they're
[1:15:58] so alive I'm living life oh I'm so alive
[1:16:02] remember that one brother randam was
[1:16:04] long time ago he this girl was half
[1:16:06] naked crawling through the thing with a
[1:16:07] beer bottle in or a liquor bottle in her
[1:16:09] hand oh this is life he said she did not
[1:16:12] know that was death but she called it
[1:16:15] life but she was living she was dead
[1:16:19] while she was living and I pray your
[1:16:21] whole spirit and soul and body be
[1:16:23] preserved blameless until the coming of
[1:16:25] our Lord Jesus Christ you say all this
[1:16:28] old thing it's you're looking at here
[1:16:30] it's corrupt
[1:16:32] absolutely but faithful is he now listen
[1:16:35] Romans 8 says if the spirit of
[1:16:39] him that raised up Jesus from the dead
[1:16:43] it shall also Quicken another body no it
[1:16:46] says you're mortal body your mortal body
[1:16:49] is what you going to live in Jesus
[1:16:51] didn't pick up another flesh body when
[1:16:52] he came no he stood out there and he
[1:16:54] said all power and Heaven and Earth been
[1:16:56] given to this
[1:16:57] guy and when we take a body change we do
[1:17:00] the same thing all power in heaven is
[1:17:03] heaven and earth when we take a body
[1:17:05] change right here they drop 5 million
[1:17:07] atomic bombs and it won't hurt
[1:17:09] us yet we'll have flesh come
[1:17:14] on we're going to pick this same body up
[1:17:17] yes sir and it's going to be
[1:17:21] changed amen
[1:17:25] I've been listening to couple of
[1:17:26] versions and I want to sing this song
[1:17:29] maybe around Easter Ain't No
[1:17:34] Grave going to hold this body
[1:17:37] down Ain't No Grave going to hold this
[1:17:41] body
[1:17:42] down and at the end of it he says if you
[1:17:44] walked out I'm walking too if you walked
[1:17:47] out I'mma walk into all right he walked
[1:17:49] out of the Grave right he walked out of
[1:17:51] that grave I'm walk into
[1:17:53] if he walked out of that grave I'm
[1:17:55] walking to something you'd work on for
[1:17:57] about three more months
[1:18:01] right but There Ain't No Grave going to
[1:18:04] hold this body
[1:18:07] down they ain't bury you in the sea they
[1:18:11] put concrete 500 miles above you and
[1:18:14] mash you to the Earth and they never
[1:18:16] find a speck of you God knows exactly
[1:18:18] where you are he knows where Abraham is
[1:18:22] right now every little speck he was
[1:18:24] he'll bring it
[1:18:26] back that's my
[1:18:28] God that's my faithful God Amen and
[1:18:32] listen we need a temporary Resurrection

[1:18:36] he heals us that's right he healed
[1:18:39] Lazarus didn't he Lazarus didn't pick up
[1:18:42] another body and bring it out of the
[1:18:43] Tomb did he hello somebody no he brought
[1:18:45] the one he was in

[1:19:15] up now it's like sunk in and he's still
[1:19:19] down there or she no she ain't if she's
[1:19:22] res Direction happens that's
[1:19:28] right like I said before Jesus could
[1:19:31] have walked through that tomb and walked
[1:19:35] right out of the wall and walked right
[1:19:36] out of that rock and stood there but he
[1:19:39] did it as a sign he rolled that thing
[1:19:42] back with his fingertips he just rolled
[1:19:44] her back and walked
[1:19:51] out
[1:19:53] right here when that sacrifice is
[1:19:55] received by the fire and it goes up like
[1:19:57] that the smoke goes up you rise with
[1:20:00] your sacrifice into the heavenlies and
[1:20:03] you're sealed away from the things of
[1:20:05] the world then our souls on his
[1:20:11] altar now remember today like I said
[1:20:13] before we we talked about this several
[1:20:15] times your Soul's in another dimension

[1:24:01] church that's what you
[1:24:03] got if you're born in a Creed there you
[1:24:07] are but if you're born in God conceived

[1:24:15] God ready to make his own word known
[1:24:17] Among Us with you speak it through you
[1:24:20] oh a new parent that parent is God am
[1:24:24] he's ready to take his word now that
[1:24:26] he's always spoke and lay it in you and
[1:24:30] make it come to
[1:24:33] life some of us need that
[1:24:37] hallu makes it come to life this is not
[1:24:43] life now look he says now you have your
[1:24:48] training now what we've been talking
[1:24:51] with 140 sermons that's your
[1:24:54] training that's your growing up time he
[1:24:57] says you're ready you're ready to go
[1:24:58] into training now child training that's
[1:25:01] the hard part when you think you ought
[1:25:03] to do this and the word Cuts you around
[1:25:05] and shows you something
[1:25:07] else while you believe that over that
[1:25:09] don't make any difference what they
[1:25:10] believe here's what God said you must be
[1:25:13] about the father's business just as
[1:25:15] Jesus said that you got say that too cuz
[1:25:17] your father is now
[1:25:20] God now you're getting born again again
[1:25:22] now you're getting right getting
[1:25:23] straightened out you have new parent so
[1:25:25] in order if you're born again and got a
[1:25:28] new parent then you got a new
[1:25:31] nature the old nature is
[1:25:35] dead you get a new nature
[1:25:39] Hallelujah that's why you'll fight if
[1:25:42] you're not born again you'll fight worse
[1:25:44] than you ever
[1:25:45] fought but when you get born again
[1:25:48] you'll fight worse than you ever
[1:25:51] fought was going to say something
[1:25:52] different didn't you no you fight you
[1:25:55] still got to
[1:25:57] fight cuz the way I see it is is you're
[1:26:00] so in tune with your own nature I hope
[1:26:03] y'all are living in the same well I hope
[1:26:05] you ain't living in this one but you're
[1:26:06] living in your body and you know what
[1:26:07] I'm talking about you fight your I don't
[1:26:09] fight sister Regina's
[1:26:11] nature okay I fight with her sometimes
[1:26:14] but nature to nature but I don't fight
[1:26:17] her nature she fights her own nature
[1:26:19] right you fight your own nature so
[1:26:21] that's an individual with God you fight
[1:26:23] even though God's changing your nature
[1:26:26] he's put a new part inside of you you
[1:26:30] still fight that old thing because
[1:26:31] remember we have a carnal
[1:26:35] mind because we go to memory reasoning
[1:26:38] conscious affection and imagination
[1:26:40] every single time what the Bible tell us
[1:26:43] to do cast down
[1:26:47] reasoning cuz you know what Paul fought
[1:26:50] the same thing you're fighting
[1:26:53] Paul literally had Christians
[1:26:56] killed
[1:26:59] Christians cuz when he was met on the
[1:27:01] road Jesus didn't say uh well you're now
[1:27:04] you're you're you're persecuting them
[1:27:05] Christians he said you're persecuting
[1:27:09] me you're persecuting me so it struck
[1:27:12] Paul he knew what the scripture said he
[1:27:14] knew what was going on as far as in the
[1:27:16] Christian world or the well not
[1:27:19] Christian for him but in that world of
[1:27:21] of law and all that other stuff he knew
[1:27:24] that when they when he said Lord and he
[1:27:26] said Paul you kicking me you're you're
[1:27:29] hurting me through these people he knew
[1:27:32] there had been a transformation
[1:27:33] somewhere and I know by the power of the
[1:27:35] Holy Ghost he said I want that same
[1:27:38] transformation do you this morning want
[1:27:40] that same transformation you do you want
[1:27:42] to what you want Den die all that that
[1:27:44] you used to do you want deny you don't
[1:27:46] want to persecute Christians
[1:27:51] anymore
[1:27:52] you got a new nature Paul got a new
[1:27:55] nature but look Paul didn't just come up
[1:27:56] and go Paul didn't just come up out of
[1:27:58] that dust and stood up brother Herman he
[1:28:01] said oh I see it
[1:28:04] now what' he have when he stood up
[1:28:07] scales on his eyes somebody had to lead
[1:28:11] him into a
[1:28:14] city oh this man wrote 80% of the New
[1:28:17] Testament he was a prophet Church A's
[1:28:19] messenger blind yes
[1:28:22] blind he was blind spiritually and
[1:28:25] naturally but what he have to do he had
[1:28:28] to go meet ance yes which had the Holy
[1:28:32] Ghost cuz an I was scared to death I'm
[1:28:35] sure he's like Paul God you
[1:28:38] sure we we've been trying to hide from
[1:28:41] this
[1:28:42] guy we've been trying to get away from
[1:28:44] him and you're sending him to my
[1:28:47] house he did what God told him to do he
[1:28:49] said you lay your hands on that man
[1:28:52] and what the Bible say when he laid
[1:28:53] hands on him the scales fell off of his
[1:28:55] eyes and then he began to what for years
[1:28:58] he went took the Old Testament he didn't
[1:29:00] just jump up and start preaching come on
[1:29:02] somebody he took the Old Testament he
[1:29:05] knew that Old Testament but what he done
[1:29:06] was is he found that Jehovah the old was
[1:29:08] Jesus of the new just like brother Ram
[1:29:11] said now look you once was going one way
[1:29:16] now you're going another way you once
[1:29:19] was going this way down now you're
[1:29:22] you're going this way up your affections
[1:29:24] are set on things above a new affection
[1:29:26] you don't love the things of the world
[1:29:28] no more your affections of God you don't
[1:29:30] care what man says how they laugh at you
[1:29:32] and you say you're an old model or
[1:29:34] whatever like that you don't care
[1:29:36] because you're born from above your
[1:29:38] affections are set on things above God's
[1:29:40] not ashamed of you and you're not
[1:29:41] ashamed of
[1:29:45] him let me get this right here this the
[1:29:47] last
[1:29:50] one last Fe Mis names 1962 watch how he
[1:29:53] words
[1:29:55] this the church is the mystical Body of
[1:29:58] Christ all right Shake Yourself just for
[1:30:00] a minute this the last quote then we'll
[1:30:02] sing a song go take have a baptismal
[1:30:04] service
[1:30:06] born of the Breath of God now listen God
[1:30:11] gave you a soul and a spirit when you
[1:30:12] became a a a b baby that I'm looking at
[1:30:15] now all right but it wasn't
[1:30:19] Eternal I just told you that you're not
[1:30:21] eternal you're not born Eternal you're
[1:30:22] born
[1:30:23] dead but that Soul's got to make a
[1:30:26] choice by the transforming power of the
[1:30:28] Holy Ghost sometime in your life if you
[1:30:29] get the new birth it transfers you just
[1:30:31] like I said you got a new set of parents
[1:30:34] you got a new place to
[1:30:36] go and you're born brother John you're
[1:30:39] born to the Breath of God he literally
[1:30:42] breathes into
[1:30:45] you all did you get it congregation says
[1:30:47] amen the Church of God is born of the
[1:30:50] Breath of God God breathed breath into
[1:30:52] the nostrils spiritually of Adam and he
[1:30:55] became a living Soul we know Adam had
[1:30:56] eternal life in his soul we know that
[1:30:58] right did you know the Pentecostals or
[1:31:00] the true Pentecostal church is born of
[1:31:03] the Breath of God let me read you
[1:31:05] something just a minute what he reads is
[1:31:07] is St John 161 19-20 what it is is I'll
[1:31:12] read it here in a second see whether the
[1:31:14] church is born of the Breath of God or
[1:31:15] not like Adam was in the beginning watch
[1:31:17] and the same day in evening being the
[1:31:19] first day of the week when the doors
[1:31:20] were shut and the disciples were s for
[1:31:21] fear of the Jews Jesus came and stood in
[1:31:24] the midst of them W peered right over
[1:31:25] didn't even have to open the door and
[1:31:27] said Peace be unto you and when he had
[1:31:30] so said he showed them his hands and his
[1:31:32] side he's quoting scripture here then
[1:31:34] were the disciples glad when they saw
[1:31:36] the Lord and then said Jesus to them
[1:31:39] peace be unto you as my father has sent
[1:31:40] me so I send you watch the father that
[1:31:43] sent him went in him and Jesus when he
[1:31:45] sends the disciple he goes in him same
[1:31:48] one sent God now look and when he had
[1:31:51] said this he breathed on them and said
[1:31:52] receive ye the Holy Ghost now remember
[1:31:56] they didn't receive the Holy Ghost right
[1:31:58] then I didn't bring the quote brother R
[1:32:00] said that was a promise right cuz cuz
[1:32:02] the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost Giver was
[1:32:04] standing
[1:32:06] there and and he couldn't have they
[1:32:08] couldn't be the body of Christ and his
[1:32:09] body standing there he had to go away so
[1:32:12] that he could come back and they become
[1:32:13] the body of
[1:32:15] Christ Church born of the Breath of God
[1:32:19] this whole church this year I want us
[1:32:22] born by the Breath of God if God gives
[1:32:24] us Liberty and he gives us time to
[1:32:26] preach it I'm going to preach it the
[1:32:29] whole year we're going to be a church
[1:32:32] born by the Breath of God not born by
[1:32:33] the breath of something
[1:32:36] else when this stature has mold look has
[1:32:39] molded itself up there in condition
[1:32:42] God's breath breathes upon them receive
[1:32:45] ye the Holy Ghost then you are a son of
[1:32:48] God you can join anything you want to
[1:32:50] but you're born into the the Church of
[1:32:52] the Living God born by the Breath of God
[1:32:54] God breathed upon them and said receive
[1:32:57] ye the Holy Ghost oh my there you are
[1:32:59] not come and join put your name in
[1:33:03] there be a message
[1:33:09] believer and with your soup suppers and

[1:33:16] P Lodge Catholic Lodge Pentecostal Lodge
[1:33:18] anything you want to join but you're
[1:33:19] joining a lodge but when you become a
[1:33:22] child of God you are
[1:33:24] born by the Breath of God Eternal God
[1:33:29] better leave it alone right there now
[1:33:31] all right he was feeling some resistance
[1:33:33] let's stand to our feet deity
[1:33:37] resides in a
[1:33:39] Christian deity resides in The Bride of
[1:33:42] Jesus
[1:33:44] Christ deity comes to
[1:33:47] church deity reads his Bible deity
[1:33:51] praise yes deity
[1:33:57] studies you saw brother that's too much
[1:34:00] no we ain't got close enough
[1:34:05] yet I'm back to that scripture again
[1:34:07] I've been all for three or four days
[1:34:10] Paul said one time he stood and he said
[1:34:12] until Christ be formed in
[1:34:15] you until Christ be formed in
[1:34:19] you cuz we're built in the image of of
[1:34:22] God but you're an individual God don't
[1:34:24] want you to look like
[1:34:28] him no we're all different he wants you
[1:34:31] to act like him he don't want you to
[1:34:34] look like him he wants you to act like
[1:34:35] him cuz we can't all look like that man
[1:34:36] right there cuz you we have
[1:34:39] females right Ryan couldn't grow a beard
[1:34:42] if he was paid
[1:34:44] to maybe in a 3 or four
[1:34:46] months but you understand what I'm
[1:34:48] saying he looks at the inside guy that
[1:34:51] inside God's Eternal it's young it never
[1:34:53] will it never has got
[1:34:55] old we're heading toward
[1:34:58] it but I'm looking at it right now and

[1:37:57] buddy you good
[1:37:59] yeah on
[1:38:01] December 10th
[1:38:05] 1994 when I was in the bathroom just
[1:38:09] kind of straightening up my wife was
[1:38:14] sick she called me and said come
[1:38:20] here
[1:38:23] [Music]
[1:38:26] I went in the room and sit down where
[1:38:28] she was as what she want she never said
[1:38:31] a word after I got there
[1:38:35] so I guess a few my uh nephew came over
[1:38:40] my nephew's son to
[1:38:42] visit and
[1:38:44] uh she began to cough so we tried to
[1:38:50] give give her
[1:38:52] a oan she wouldn't take it and a few
[1:38:58] minutes where I was just sitting there I
[1:39:00] guess iwh around 12:30 in the in the
[1:39:04] afternoon the nurse had told me if her
[1:39:07] feet start to get cold and everything
[1:39:09] she life is
[1:39:11] leaving and
[1:39:14] um by that
[1:39:16] time uh real smooth white looking light
[1:39:21] came across just below her knees and it
[1:39:25] moved up a
[1:39:27] body moved all the way up until it when
[1:39:31] it reached somewhere up here by naked it
[1:39:35] lifted off and when it lifted off life
[1:39:39] left the body and
[1:39:42] uh so it was
[1:39:45] just a hard time
[1:39:48] but we had talked few days before but
[1:39:53] she said everything was all right amen
[1:39:57] and that uh she never left she only left
[1:40:02] one thing cuz I keep this to myself but
[1:40:04] she only left one thing she told me not
[1:40:06] to do and so I try to remember that wish
[1:40:12] amen but uh that's all
[1:40:16] and some days I miss her and others you
[1:40:20] know I don't but I just ask just pray
[1:40:24] that God give me strength to move on and
[1:40:29] the time is
[1:40:32] closer than ever before amen and so
[1:40:36] thank God right
[1:40:41] amen I didn't realize that but that's
[1:40:44] been a while you know I've always said
[1:40:47] just for a minute we got all
[1:40:49] day as
[1:40:52] Christians we are different than the
[1:40:55] world so in another
[1:40:58] dimension they look into this Dimension
[1:41:00] and they see we're
[1:41:02] different I I just believe
[1:41:05] that now remember Christians can't
[1:41:11] die Christians cannot die they move into
[1:41:15] another place brother Brown said it does
[1:41:17] not change you it changes your what Your
[1:41:19] Dwelling Place
[1:41:22] so the Old Death Angel comes down to get
[1:41:24] you he takes Millions a day and throws
[1:41:28] them into that Fifth Dimension don't
[1:41:29] care a thing it's just a job for him he
[1:41:31] just throws them over in there I'll
[1:41:33] promise you one
[1:41:36] thing that dirty death angel don't come
[1:41:38] get you if you're a Christian as a white
[1:41:41] light
[1:41:42] comes as a white light comes into that
[1:41:45] room and it takes you and it puts you in
[1:41:48] an eternal
[1:41:49] dimension one that that Death Angel
[1:41:52] cannot occupy because there's no death
[1:41:55] over here only death over here so sister
[1:41:59] Ruth that white light swirled around
[1:42:01] just took her picked this what we were
[1:42:02] talking about just took that soul and
[1:42:03] just set it right over in another
[1:42:05] dimension and that old angel said Death
[1:42:07] Angel no this is not yours this one's
[1:42:10] mine this one's
[1:42:12] mine I'm
[1:42:14] Michael I've conquered they've accepted
[1:42:17] me you go stay over there I'm taking
[1:42:20] this one in to my Dimension my
[1:42:23] Dimension is the Eternal Dimension
[1:42:26] that's the difference you say it's a
[1:42:27] fairy tale okay you stay the way you are
[1:42:30] and you try to figure out about 3
[1:42:32] seconds before you pass away from this
[1:42:33] Earth that's about the lifetime you
[1:42:36] going to have an opportunity and 3
[1:42:38] seconds maybe too late but sister Ruth
[1:42:41] made her way long time
[1:42:44] ago she knew she was
[1:42:47] fine you talk to any uh uh several uh
[1:42:53] morticians they'll tell you they know
[1:42:55] when a Christian comes in and when a
[1:42:56] sinner comes in yeah complete different
[1:42:59] look on the on the face complete
[1:43:02] different he said there's no fight
[1:43:05] they're at
[1:43:07] rest even in
[1:43:10] death even in death God shows he's
[1:43:13] alive inside of you even in this thing

[1:47:37] yours ain't that what I nias did Paul
[1:47:40] fed off his Holy Ghost and Paul received
[1:47:41] the Holy Ghost because he had to go to
[1:47:44] where the life was he didn't go out
[1:47:46] there in the desert all them people were
[1:47:48] probably unbelievers they were going to
[1:47:49] kill Christians so I guess they were
[1:47:51] unbelievers but God had to get him in an
[1:47:54] atmosphere come on somebody God had to
[1:47:56] get him in an atmosphere to where he
[1:47:58] could deal with him that's right that's
[1:48:00] the same way with us he has to get us in
[1:48:02] a place to where he can deal with us and
[1:48:05] sometimes it may be a a a place that you
[1:48:09] that you you don't you can't figure God
[1:48:11] out but I'll promise you one thing God
[1:48:14] is not the author of confusion he's not
[1:48:17] the author of
[1:48:19] Chaos
[1:48:20] he's the author of
[1:48:22] peace and he'll give you peace in your
[1:48:24] heart as this as the song says in the
[1:48:26] midst of the storm not before not after
[1:48:29] in the middle of it he'll give you peace
