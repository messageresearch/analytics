hope you're here to see him amen how many you are happy to be in the house of God Amen I'm happy I was just sitting there I was just in there thinking you know I know brother Dale and brother way have said it many times you know you are our our real family you know you really are true family the the mo the most the the best family that you will have are the ones that are in the Lord amen and so that that is your true family and so if your immediate family is in the Lord then that's that's just a double blessing so we just thank God Amen praise the Lord Jesus well we're going to go ahead and go to the uh Lord in prayer and um well I'm going to try to use this thing right here I'm not trying to be brother Wade but it's coming in handy so uh what was that okay so anyways we will uh see how this works out for us I'm just going to try it out and see and and if not then we'll go back to the the regular way so let's just bow our heads this evening our gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus what an awesome opportunity that we have Lord to Lord just read father God just one verse in your word father Lord Lord God we could just read the word father and we could just go home Lord Jesus and and say that father God uh wer in you father speaking to us Lord God along the way Lord Jesus but father God we we desire more of you Lord Jesus we're just not filled with Ju Just satisfied with just a little portion Lord God we want the most that we can get from you Lord and I just pray Heavenly Father this evening that that you would just help us father as we Endeavor to open back the pages of your word help us to receive something that would uh help us father to be more like you Lord God because that is our heart's desire Lord Jesus and Lord I just pray that you would continue to meet the needs amongst us you know what they are we've already prayed for them earlier Lord God so Lord there are in your hands father and we just commit the rest of this time into your hands Lord use my lips Lord Jesus get me out of these notes if I must Lord God Almighty to speak directly to the needs Lord Lord God because I don't know the needs but you do Lord and so heavenly father I just want to do father God what you ask me to do Lord granted Lord Jesus we just commit the time into your hands in Jesus Christ's name amen praise the Lord Jesus amen well let's turn to um Proverbs chapter 4 and uh I want to see if I could uh start a little series I I want to call it matters of the heart and this will be part one kind of laying a little Foundation I I come to realize saints that that um everything that happens in our lives and everything that goes on it boils down to a an issue of the heart there's nothing that goes on no matter whether you're a sinner or a saint it all boils down to a heart heart issue uh and and later on maybe uh uh in in other messages we'll find out that Satan from the beginning has wanted your heart yeah right but God has also wanted your heart and and so it's a it's where brother brandom also preached that message the greatest battle ever fought maybe we might touch that upon that at a later point but we realize that that it's it's it's a it's a heart issue that we're dealing with in this hour am and um and so the Bible clearly tells us amen that that we need to guard our hearts amen because Satan's really targeting targeting so we want to go to Proverbs chapter 4 and and read the scriptures here and you all can see that right amen okay all right so it says in Proverbs chapter 4 verse 20 it says my son attend to my words incline thine ear unto my sayings now we know this is this is Solomon speaking the wisest man that ever lived right and he says verse 21 let them not depart from thine eyes keep them in the midst of thine heart he's talking about his words now I want you to realize that is this is God speaking through Solomon right so this is this is not just Solomon speaking this is God speaking right let them not depart from Thine Eyes keep them in the midst of thine heart what those words those sayings for they are life unto those that find them and health to all their flesh notice how it says for they are life unto those that find them the word the sayings of God are life he said my words are spirit and their life verse 23 and this is where I want to start with and concentrate keep thy heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues of Life praise the Lord Jesus you may be seated appreciate your patience amen the good new the good new translation says be careful how you think your life is shaped by your thoughts amen so as we're going through here these are these are my raw notes these are these are notes that usually you don't see but I wanted to test this thing so so uh you might see some things that were just for me but you'll get to see them tonight and see how I usually take notes but the Bible says there in the good news translation be careful how you think your life is shaped by your thoughts absolutely amen it's really really what this boils down to whatever you think whatever you put your mind to whatever you do it was originated by a thought first you had to think it you had to ponder it you had to uh consider it in order for you to put it into action right you know we saw that even in in in in in Genesis in in in the Garden of Eden there with with with Eve and the serpent Satan had to inject the thought first into Eve and it could have been a process of many years I don't know we don't know exactly how long it was but it was a process that started very very little amen and then it finally grew she she ruminated kind of uh uh chewed on that a little bit more and more every day until finally it culminated into what Satan really wanted for her to to to perform and it culminated into an action and that's how it is it is with us tonight Saints most of the time we don't do things just out of just like that most of the time it's because we actually thought about it and then you take action amen and so and so that can be that that that's tricky you see because sometimes you know we we might do things up on on a whim and get ourselves in trouble but also we can think about things and then eventually get ourselves in trouble as well you see so it's it it's very tricky now in Matthew uh 12:34 and 35 Jesus says this oh Generation of Vipers how can ye being evil he was speaking to the to the Pharisees and uh later on uh maybe in another sermon we'll we we'll take the context of what he what what was going on here but he says this oh Generation of Vipers how can you being evil speak good things for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh a good man out of the good Treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things notice that he calls it a good treasure right the good Treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll look at that we'll look at that a little bit later now we know that physical heart Trouble Is On The Rise since 20 2019 it's rose up I don't know how much since since Co it's rose up I don't know how much right amen but at the same time we see that spiritual heart Trouble Is On The Rise as well uh if you're not seeing that then then you're just you're just in la la land people are are are are dying physically that's right they say that young people are having more heart attacks now than ever had before am amen and Satan is targeting the young people more than ever had before and they're dying like flies as well spiritually amen people are dying spiritually left and right people who you think wow they they're just faithful Christians my goodness just dying like flies Y and you're wondering what is going on but Satan is on the Rampage amen but God is also on the ramp because as people are dying amen this bride is rising up somebody's going to stay firm somebody's not going to listen to the LIE of the devil somebody is going to believe God's word in their soul Amen in their heart they're going to accept God's word in their heart and it won't just be head knowledge amen it'll be heart knowledge amen it'll be it'll be in the heart it'll put you into action to believe the rest of the word no matter what Satan brings on you no matter what Satan throws at you amen you stay steadfast God said he was going to have Overcomers in this life am in this in this generation and I believe I'm looking at him right now I don't know about you you can be there well I don't know I I I I I you should have just heard what I told my wife yesterday if you repented of it I don't God don't see it amen and don't let the devil keep telling you that or keep reminding you of that because he's only lying y praise God amen amen well right I spoke to my husband and just I I just didn't like the attitude I had forget about it if you've repented put it to God ask your husband to forgive you and move on Amen because that's what we're that's what we we got to do Saints we're living in a late hour amen it's not time to play games it's time to move forward amen especially when you see what the things happen around us amen now in Luke 20 Luke 2026 21:26 tells us that man's heart's failing them for fear Jesus speaking about the end times and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth for the powers of Heaven shall be shaken Saints I I I want to tell you that it doesn't matter what happens there will be Wars rumors of wars all things are taking place we see the word of God that is around us that is being fulfilled amen but this is the time for you to actually rejoice in the Lord his word is coming to pass do not get fixated and do not get uh uh fearful amen for what's going on Amen because God is in control ultimately the Lord is in control do not come out with your own conclusions about things people for a long time have thought that this is what's happening this is what's happening and nothing like that didn't come out the way they say it was going to happen am so you just stay working and thinking about the word of God amen amen how can I grow spiritually in the time of of of what's happening in Israel amen how can I keep growing in the Lord how can I become a better brother how can I become a better sister a a better son or a better daughter a a better husband a better wife amen I I that's fine what the Lord is doing in Israel that that that's fine amen but what what's going on in your life in your Israel amen Satan is fighting in your the the in your mind that's the greatest battle ever fought even even higher than what's going on in Israel right now cuz he's after your soul amen amen and we don't want to give him our soul we don't want to give him our heart amen praise the Lord Jesus so let's uh let's let's kind of break down this this uh this Proverbs 4: 23 and it says keep thy heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues of life now I want I I put here that in this verse we we find the what of this verse and what is the what of this verse it is the heart right then we have the how of this verse and usually usually before the the how we usually have the why before that but in this case the how comes next and then and and and what and and the how is of this verse is to keep it with all diligence amen and the why of this verse is because out of it comes the issues of Life brother man young people and adults amen it has to be formed in your heart first you have to first let something through the Avenues of the of the of of the of the hearing and the and the seeing and and the five physical senses to come into you to and process it through the spirit spiritual through through through a spirit man and then if you let it and it's your choice if you let it then it'll sit there in your heart and create a create a problem if you choose to do so and brother brandham talked about that in such detail in in in in the greatest battle ever fought amen and so it's it's your decision amen this all stems on free moral agency of what's going to happen in your life you decide God has placed the the the the word before you he's placed the way out for you he's placed the plan for you you decide if you want to if you want to choose life or death amen and then when time comes that you're judged you're judged according to your decision amen because God gave you the choice amen and I thank God for that am amen thank God that he gives us that's his grace to us amen praise the Lord now so the scripture there tells us to keep thy heart with all diligence now if you look at the definition of keep it says to watch to guard to keep to preserve Guard from dangers to keep observe guard with Fidelity to guard keep secret to be kept closed to be blockaded amen and I started thinking about the role of of the Watchmen in the Bible Watchmen uh in the Bible what what was their purpose in in the Bible a Watchman that was guarding a castle or a big a big fortress it was to make sure that the enemy could be seen from far off not that the enemy would get so close and then we'll do something about it no to see how to see how far how we can see the enemy away from their target then go go to them if we need to right call out the Infantry and go take care of that then but what we do is we allow the enemy to come in so close so close they're at the they're at the door I mean they're just getting ready to knock your door down and that's when you think that you should do something about it come on brother and it might be too late then you're already teetering there at the border amen right there at the world and that's what happens with a lot of us man especially young people am man they're just teetering right there at the world and they think that they have it under control and not knowing it just the wrong step amen they are going down the enemy completely takes over amen so that's what a Watchman was supposed to do he was supposed to constantly watch and see the enemy from far off to make adjustments to make calls to make to do whatever it took to so they they can guard he could guard the castle or guard the whatever they were watching for or or guarding that was the purpose of the Watchmen amen and so Solomon here is telling us in Proverbs to keep a close watch of your heart in this manner Amen to keep a close guard of your life amen because really the heart is really who you are amen right amen it's the soul amen amen it's it's who you really are because let me tell you you can put on a facade on the outside but God knows who you are on the inside you can put on here at church all you want to but God knows what really goes on in that heart am come on Amen and so if if we're if we're slack and if we're not lazy watching our hearts making sure that we are diligent Amen in what we do what we don't do how we pray when we pray how we do things Amen to grow and to amen then we we are we are we are uh uh susceptible to be attacked by the enemy much easier remember what Satan wants at the beginning he wants that heart yes he does he wants unbelief in your soul because with unbelief in that Soul amen then you won't have any chance to to accept the rest of the word of God you've you've done you you've disbel the word amen that's why those Pharisees and we'll talk about those Pharisees later on the Pharisees they were putting on outward see they thought they knew the law and they did but not enough to cause them to live the law they didn't love it enough that they wanted to live it they were in such good standing before the people that they were able to get away and maneuver themselves to make the people think we're doing this but in reality they're in the they're behind the scenes doing other stuff right brother amen and Jesus knew that amen Ain no telling what else what what they were doing but because Jesus said that you are just man with full of dead Man's Bones on the outward you look good you're just tombs full of Dead Man's Bones but in the inside they were rotten on the outward they they they they looked like they were keeping the law they looked like they were doing everything and even more right right and even even for how much they knew about the law but they didn't love the law enough to make them change from the inside out and we saw that we see that that evidence because when Messiah came and they and Messiah started doing good deeds Healing The Sick amongst them they were so full of jealousy so full of they they were okay for for for demons to be cast out and all that because they knew that that that by the power of God that was done but not if Jesus did it that's right if Jesus did it was a different thing I wonder if we take some of the some sometimes that that that attitude amen that's right amen so it's okay if brother so and so does it but I if brother so and so does it oh I have a problem with it and brother so and so is being used by God and brother Z and so is probably a is probably just uh uh uh taking your hideout by the through the word and that's what you don't like that's right he's spanking you spiritually because God told him to and that's what you don't like you don't like the word being preached to you but you like the word being preached but not to you I've been there we don't like the word when it comes personal level and it starts touching down to your home base to your your your your your your heart coming down to the Heart level that's what we don't like right oh yes but we love what the word preached though those Pharisees love the law but not when Jesus came into the heart and talk about their their their personal issues but it was the word anyhow it's the word anyhow when it's preached amen praise God Amen so that was the the the roles of the Watchmen and that's what we have to do amen we have to watch our lives in this way as a Watchman praise God diligent now verse 23 keeps saying keep thy heart with all D diligence and the word diligence means this steady Earnest and energetic effort amen it's an effort Saints to serve the Lord amen it doesn't come to you amen you have to put something into this as well that's right praise God it it would be easy to to for everything to just come to you but you got to put something into this in order to get something out of it amen right devoted in painstaking work and application to accomplish an undertaking you know and and it seems like in in in America we it looks like that that all you know the churches all they they keep making Christianity how fun it is and and how how good you can have a good time at church and and and Just Dance it dance it all off until their wigs fall off and and and go back home and and and and and listen to rap music and curse at their husband and and then come back Sunday and do it again that's right until your wigs fall off and everything falls off and it's fun church is fun that's what they think that's right but there is no fighting back home there is no no no victory over over your life amen no no victory over over you amen when you when you're tired and you you don't want to pray but but yet you you you pray because you it's coming from the heart amen and not from from the outside amen not for where you could get out of it amen but what glorifies him because you desire a a relationship with God amen amen praise the Lord Jesus don't think that church is is fun church can be fun yeah but it's fun when you got the Holy Ghost Inside amen too many people am amen just come to church to see what they can get out of what fun they can get out and that's what these corporate churches have made it right brother I call them corporate churches the one the ones that use them logos that that that look like corporate logos they're corporate churches that's what IBM uses and and and and and Amazon and all that well they it's it's an organization it's a business I'm not saying that they're not good people in there I'm sure that there are sincere people in there and I've I've benefit from some of those some some some some of those preachings and and and and songs as well but ultimately Saints what are you coming to church foren what is your purpose what's in your heart amen because remember this is a heart matter it's matters of the heart something is driving you to come to church what is it amen come on are you afraid that man is going to say something to you if you don't is is that the reason why you come to church or do you want to come to church because your heart what God put in your heart through his word that's what desires that that's what wants more amen what what is what is your purpose amen and I appreciate each and every one of you all yes sir amen I love you all and I don't I don't I don't say anything to hurt anybody that's not my purpose so please don't F you feel kind of this push back sometimes and come on come on maybe we're touching the [Laughter] heart so we have D diligence amen uh uh and when we painstakenly work on our lives we we we are diligent to keep your our homes as neat as we can no no grease spot anywhere no dirt no nothing amen something will come along the way that'll change that's right it ain't all about that no that's right we're diligent to keep our cars as speak and span as possible but wait until you have children I you know I thought that I could keep my vehicles you know nice no no crumbs in the back and no melting crayons in the in the on the side doors or anything like that gummies and things like that that went out the window that's but I'm not blaming my children that's not what I'm trying to say I'm just saying that that right there changed my mindset about your cars are not going to last forever they're going to deteriorate from the inside out and that's God teaching me something because I was very I loved my cars you know I had a 1998 Honda Civic that was my first car man I had that thing shiny I had that thing looking good all the time my wife got to drive that's where she learned how to drive it was a manual and uh but that went out the window you know when we started having children you know and the God was teaching me something you're paying you're very diligent with your car Louise what about your prayer life what about your studying of the word amen do you love those children more than that car or that car more than those children are are you willing to take you know what we do sometimes we we get upset at our children for messing up our vehicles and stuff like that and what you're really doing is you're hurting them they're they're now they're they're becoming afraid of you because you they're touch they're touching or doing something with the reality what you can what you need to do is just let it go so that you can win them more amen and and it's something that I had to learn and and but God works with us in different levels amen your car ain't going to last forever it doesn't have eternal life and it doesn't even have a [Laughter] heart praise God that's why I buy them used not new they Ramsey said so [Laughter] too amen diligence to come out on top financially I mean we all desire that right amen we're supposed to be good stewards for of our of our of our money amen but some of us we get so fixated on that and and we and we're so concentrated on that and making sure that our finances and that our money is well and then you're forgetting the main thing what you can use those finances for amen why are you accumulating wealth on this life when you're going to who are you going to leave it to amen you see diligence to finish school we all need to finish school young people you've got to finish school amen and sometimes we can get so fixed about the education and I've got to finish High School I've got to graduate amen but who can help you get through high school who can help you get through college who can help you amen think about the who the the him that can help you get through those things amen diligence to get married amen we we give it so much diligence amen I've got to find somebody in my life of a husband I got to find a wife and and you're not even seeking him first brother you're seeking the other man first but you're not seeking him right first right and then we find the the great mistakes that young people sometimes get into three years down the road they're they're they're they're filing for divorce or or something on those sort why because they rushed they were diligent about seeking a man in their life or or or a lady or or a sister in their life but not diligent enough to seek the Lord first amen praise God and we're diligent to look good and feel good amen that the world is is is is is all about wanting to feel good and and look good and all you got to do is just scroll through Facebook and you you'll you'll you'll see that right but we're all diligent for this but the the Bible tells us amen that we need to be diligent about keeping the heart with all diligence you want to give all effort to all these things that's great give the all that you've got but remember you give God more amen praise the Lord Jesus be diligent with all these things amen because we're diligent in many many things but we're not diligent enough to seek God to guard our heart right because remember why are we doing this why are we doing this because out of it look what Solomon says but above all guard your heart your inner life your soul amen remember what brother Ram said about the soul is worth what a dollar 50 cents that's what the rapper is 50 Cents if y'all know who 50 Cent is his soul might be worth that if he don't come to the Lord that's right not but your soul a is what BR said is worth 10,000 worlds amen what is that that means it has no value to it I mean it has unlimited value that's what I mean right your soul is very very important amen it's so important that Satan wants it yes he amen and people sell their souls for money for rock and roll for for fame for all these things they they're willing to sell it sure amen and there is no turning back when you fully give into the devil's lies but God also wants your soul right amen and as a matter of fact he's the one who gave you that Soul so what he gave you we give back to him and and Lord you reside in my soul we want your mind and what is his mind his soul his spirit amen so that he he let mind of Christ be in you praise God Amen and let that work through you amen right praise the Lord Jesus so why why should we keep the heart with all diligence and in verse 23 and it says there at the end for out of it are the issues of life amen in other words you you will be made or broken according to what happens in your heart that's right right you will be made or broken according to what happens in your life everyone of life's great issues events problems victories successes Etc at the root stem from being a matter of the heart everything that happens in your life sir is the root cause is the heart amen amen and so let that's why we want God to get a hold of us at a young age amen you know there's a quote where brother brandom is saying that that that uh he says something on the line of um when he was 12 years old and God was trying to to get a hold of him but he said there was a spirit on him that's right that wouldn't let him come to God right there's something on those lines that he said that he says that in some 1950s and you see Satan at a young at a young age he wants you young people he he wants you but if at a young age you can get to God Amen if at a young age you can let God get a hold of your heart amen it would be much easier at your walk Amen in life it wouldn't be easy I'm just saying it'll be easier amen praise the Lord Jesus amen now brother Brandon would say it like this he says as I was saying a few days ago either here or somewhere speaking on the lie detector now notice close now I want you to pay close attention put a lie detector on you and you try to impersonate that truth and try to say that it's truth but down on the inside of you in the subconscious lays a place called The Soul so even when you are telling a lie the the device is knows because what it does it's making your body act in a certain way your body was not made to lie your body was not made to to steal to think bad thoughts to do all these things so when you are put on on a lie detector if the police C thinks that that you may know something uh and and they put you on a lie detector or or polygraph test I think is what it's called that machine will know if you're lying or not it's it's from my understanding it's it's pretty accurate because not because the body is telling it yes he's lying here or no he's not lying here but it's the way your body reacts when you do tell a lie your body starts getting nervous your body and so the the machine is made to detect that that nervousness I don't know all the details about it so that's what brother brandom is talking about here amen he's saying you put a lie detector on you and you try to impersonate that truth and try to say that it's truth you I am telling the truth but down on the inside of you in the subconscious lays a place called The Soul amen and this intellectual mind does not govern that vibration of the system the mind is only only a director it will direct you and it's very incapable of bringing you to God your mind so he says here you cannot know God by your mind or in other words intellectuals now later on he'll talk about the mind in the in the greatest battle ever fault we'll discuss that later on but here he's talking about the intellectuals amen intellectually you cannot know God in the heart right you cannot you can you can learn things things in the mind and and but that does not mean that you know God in the heart that's right you see you can know the Bible you can you can read the the you can know the verses you can even know the quotes but it it takes it to be down in the heart for there to be a true transformation amen that's what matters it's one of the resources he says or the channels that would lead to it but says here but your soul is what governs you that's right you are what you are by your soul amen you are what you think about at night you are what you think about during the day what's driving you what's pushing you is it the word of God or is it a little or is it some sort of stimulant from the internet come on now you see right praise God now in Proverbs 23:7 Bible says there for as he thinketh in his heart so is he amen so in other words whatever you think in your heart that's what you are amen amen whatever you constantly think about that's what will come out of you praise the Lord Jesus out of the Jesus said out of the abundance of the heart will your mouth speak praise God Amen now Marcus aelius I don't know if you all have heard of Marcus aelius he's a a philosoph oper he said the following he said the soul is dyed the color of its thoughts whatever your thoughts are and I thought that was pretty interesting the soul is dyed the color of its thoughts so if they're good thoughts then they'll be died with those good thoughts if they're bad thoughts they'll be died with those bad thoughts and those bad thoughts will eventually culminate into actions oh you could say well I'm just thinking about it well that thought just came cross to your mind you know that thought you know whatever it may be and if you sit there and play with that thought you might say I'll never put that into action I'll never actually do that but man it's it's actually pretty interesting though but it'll never happen though you're playing with the thought right and it could be years years for that to to take place you know an an an adultery doesn't take place just right away most of the time it could be it could be years for that to have gotten in the Heart Right some thought may have come in right there and like the secretary at work she's a pretty nice girl yeah and just playing with that thought brother and Satan will come in and anoint that y well and you accepted that thought because remember it comes through what you saw you ruminated it in the spirit realm right the conscience the affections the my she she she she needs someone too but you know but my wife you know I'm just being real with you all and that's how Satan starts and then you desire and then you start thinking and if you if you let it get into your heart that's the moment where you can say okay I reject that or or I accept it that's right when you accept it then you start cuddling that thought even more that's right man look how she looks today and your poor wife at home and that's how things happen eventually I'm just using that as a thought as as as a as an example because saying Saints that's how tricky the devil is and what what s what Satan wants to do is above all things he wants to destroy marriages because he if he can destroy marriages he destroys the family completely and destroys the whole church amen praise God someone said one time a man is what he thinks about all day long yeah that's what you are oh I just think about cars all day long well that's what you are you just that's that's what you are I mean you let you you is the word of God fit in there somewhere does it fit in there somewhere nothing wrong with cars but does the word of God fit in there somewhere amen praise the Lord Jesus look what a poet expressed one uh one day uh he said this he said it this way he said I have a house inside of me a house that others seldom see it has a door through which none pass and windows but they're not of glass where do you live ask folks I meet and then I say on such a street but still I know what's really me lives in a house folks never see that's the heart that's who you really are again you could put on a s before people all day long but God knows that heart and you know what's in your heart amen praise the Lord amen now I don't want to keep you all here too long tonight but um let's talk about the difference between reputation and character amen reputation is what people think you are that's right that's right that's that's your reputation I'm just trying to keep up my reputation you're trying to keep up so what people think you are right but what character is is what God knows you are as he looks upon your heart amen that's character amen that's why brother randam said that character is a victory right because whatever you do in secret when others are not looking that's what count that's what DET that's what tells what your heart really is that's right right see what we do in front of the public that's just our reputation and that's what the public knows that's why Facebook is so tricky social media is so tricky it's a facade most of the time now I'm not saying that there's no there's people there that that don't portray themselves and you know genuinely whatever happened that day I mean if they're eating uh you know a hamburger that day and they whatever that's the picture that they're going to take that's what they are they got it hanging on the side of their face and that they're going to just show what they are right but then some people they just show what they're not right and that's that's that's what social media is about it's displaying your reputation but what really you are is what you do behind the scenes that's the heart amen right so that's what character is character is a victory brother brandom said it's to be able to do the right thing when nobody else is looking amen and that's hard especially when you're driving on the road oh yeah look at y'all Y started smiling and and and uh Well everybody's going 90 miles an hour should you nobody there's no cops around I know there's no cops around this road says 55 speed limit 65 70 now that's character they say well the cops ain't watching me but God is that's that's the tough part amen I it's nice when it gets quiet cuz I know you're talking to the heart amen true character lies in the heart's Purity amen amen amen praise the lord it's deceiving to think what happens inside doesn't matter as long as the outside looks clean that's very deceiving me and that's what the Pharisees did they did amen they did that and and they they they perfected that yes amen because everything was going so well for them until Jesus came on the scene until the manifested word that they thought that they believed really came on the scene and exposed what they really were that's right amen and that's why we don't like it when the word exposes us now a true the a true daughter and son of God likes it when the word exposes you amen a false per a false one doesn't like it amen likes the anointing but doesn't like the reality of what the word can really do for you amen praise the Lord Jesus amen so Jesus says in Matthew chap 15: 19-2 for out of the heart proceed evil thoughts murders adulteries fornications thefts false Witnesses uh blasphemies these are the things which def follow man in other words out of your heart come evil thoughts murder unfaithfulness in marriage vulgar Deeds stealing telling lies and insulting others Jesus said that all of that comes out of your heart am you were born with those things inside of you before you came to the Lord and that's why we always have to guard guard our hearts amen because those things will want to spring back up eventually they will want to amen but that's what we have to do what what what what Solomon said there in Proverbs to guard our heart because out of it comes the the the the things of life amen these are what make you unclean praise the Lord so what's in the heart ruins you outwardly as well amen amen now let's let's just take this last verse here and maybe with this we'll we we'll finish it up in Matthew 12:35 and it says he says here Jesus says a good man notice that it's a good man right out of the good Treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things if it just said there that it was a good man then it could just be a hypocrite y right you can be a good man and not have good treasure in the heart amen you can act and pretend like you're good but not really have good treasure in the heart and we we we see that many times out of the good Treasure of the heart now the the treasure has to be good as well you have to have good treasure what are you feeding on in your life young people what are we feeding on what are we allowing to come into our minds that that that are that are influencing Our Lives that's right they are influencing our thoughts they are influencing the way we talk they are influencing the way we think amen that is what is good treasure and that's what we got to do amen when we when we come to the Lord is to keep feeding on the word of God Amen and as you're feeding on the word of God you're feeding on those good things and you're adding into that Storehouse that Coffer amen good treasure so that you can bring forth good things because you can't bring forth good things if you're feeding on the trash of the world if you're feeding on Netflix and just to make it clear I don't have a Netflix account I deleted that a long time ago I do have Amazon Prime [Laughter] though but many of you do too but what what are we feed I'm not on it though 247 though I do order from it though what are we feeding on young people what are we feeding on adults remember we've got to we've got to add good treasure in the heart they amen so that you can so that if you think right then you can do right right and then he says here Jesus continues to say and an evil man out of the evil treasure bring him for bringeth forth evil things amen it is no surprise it's no it's no surprise that if you're feeding off the the the dirt of the world you're going to be dirty and you're going to look dirty if that is what you're allowing to come into your mind and you're accept it in the heart right and I'm afraid that a lot of us amen we've accepted the the the the education of the world Amen and have accepted it in the heart and now there it's hard to get that out I mean it's it's it's not impossible for the Lord but then you'll see the people amen whatever's in their heart that's what will come out you'll see them act out whatever is in their heart amen so when we're feeding on the good things when we're feeding on the word what's got to come out of that the word right when we're feeding on the right things of of God Amen what has to come out of that the right things of God when you're feeding on the trash of the world then trash will come out amen it's what Jesus is saying here amen but it deals with the heart amen it all stems from the heart amen and they may take a while for all those things to manifest but they eventually will amen what's in the heart will eventually be manifested manifested outwardly amen and let's talk about suppression real quick for just a moment because sometimes we can suppress those things in our lives right some some people can suppress those things and and and not show that that's what I'm doing on the background and they'll suppress it but eventually it comes out right eventually comes out you know I I help my wife uh sometimes I I I cook rice in a pot you know we cook rice we eat a lot of rice at the house and and you put that thing on high you know to to to start cooking and and you can put a lid on top of that pot and that that pot will start cooking that rice in there and you think that that lid will stay on there but that Rice gets hot enough and that pot's there to eventually that lid's going to come off mean you you can you can sit there and hold it in like that but that thing is is moving it's shaking it's cooking it because why whatever is happening on the inside it wants to come out and you can suppress it for a while but eventually that steam is going to find a little crack somewhere around that lid to come out and that's how it is a in the spiritual amen you could suppress things for a while but eventually there's a little crack somewhere and that will come out and really show forth who you are amen really show forth what's happening in your life amen praise the Lord Jesus and look what suppression means to put down by Authority or or Force to restrain from a usual course or action and you could you can artificially suppress something but at some point amen the reality of it is going to come out amen so suppressing your intentions your feelings emotions that doesn't work that doesn't work eventually every what what's in there it will come out I put here cough suppressant like a like a l La you think oh that's going to take my cough away no it doesn't only temporarily it's a suppression only temporarily and they know that that's why they want to keep keep you buying it it's a suppressant that it only suppresses it for just a little while amen and eventually that cough of what really is it'll come out again you see so we can't suppress things in our lives amen if it's in our heart amen we've got to do something about that amen that's right we got to say Lord Jesus help me Lord Lord I can't give this up in my life but heavenly father I know that you are the you are my victory you are my you are my helper you are the one that can change my heart you are the one that can that can turn this thing around for me because I can't do it on my own amen but if that desire is not in you then has Satan gotten in your heart and caused you to disbelieve his word but I'd say this that if you're still here there's a chance for you that's right God's not done with you amen if if you're still here you haven't you haven't send your day of Grace away come on God is not through with you amen amen praise the Lord Jesus amen so what is inside the treasury of the heart will eventually spill out amen praise the Lord Jesus and with that we'll just stop right there amen you know you you you you hear of so many of so many things that you know situations and and and and and in life and and people you know who you looked up to and and you thought my goodness that Minister that preacher I mean I mean he's just solid as solid can be and then and then all of a sudden something just happens and in reality wizard really wasn't all of a sudden it was a transition it was something that to was taking place in the Heart All This Time amen and we didn't and you don't realize it amen but that's how Satan wants to get you he doesn't want to he doesn't get you right away he gets you little by little amen amen and so that's why what we need to guard our hearts amen especially in the hour that we live in that we live in it's so deceiving guard our hearts amen and make sure that we are taking care of that word that God has put in US amen cuz Satan would definitely want to rob that from us amen praise the Lord Jesus let's stand to our feet tonight amen if you had the musicians come hey man let's maybe if we can sing that song uh brother Boyd I don't I don't know what you had but creating me a clean heart key of G okay amen G me a clean heart if there's anybody that needs prayer you might say Lord Jesus I I don't know you know I I I don't know where to go from here you might be at a moment where where you you know you you're confused amen God is not the author of confusion Satan is what's gotten you confused man God wants to set you free amen God wants to deliver your mind God wants to deliver your thoughts and align your thinking Amen to his word amen praise the Lord Jesus and as I said you wouldn't be here if God is it was through with you and so don't believe that lie of Satan that you've already sinned too much you've already he's just throwing condemnation at you to hinder you putting those roadblocks in in your life so that you don't come to the truth so that you don't come to the word so that you don't come Amen to be able to have that mind of Christ in you praise the Lord Jesus let's sing that tonight a clean heart and renew right Spirit Within Me create in me a clean heart oh God and reew AR right Spirit Within Me cast me not away
