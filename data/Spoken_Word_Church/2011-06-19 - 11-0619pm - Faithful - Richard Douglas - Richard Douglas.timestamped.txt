[25:01] for that
[25:02] appreciate each and every one of you
[25:05] for coming out again this afternoon
[25:08] you're under expectation for god to do
[25:10] something for you
[25:11] man you have to expect him to do it you
[25:12] know a lot of times i think we miss it
[25:14] because we don't expect him to do that
[25:16] that's right we get in the same old rut
[25:19] same old
[25:20] we kind of get almost ritualistic
[25:22] sometimes i just
[25:24] well same old preacher same old thing
[25:27] just over and over but god's always
[25:29] moving he's always saying something
[25:31] right
[25:32] i mean
[25:33] it could be
[25:35] i believe you say some keynotes that
[25:36] will help us in this journey tonight i
[25:38] believe
[25:39] you'll say things to us that we really
[25:40] have needed
[25:42] could you stand with me for the reading
[25:43] of his word sure love
[25:45] brother dale by the way
[25:48] we're there in the hall of each and
[25:49] every one of you just so thankful for
[25:51] you
[25:52] when you stand for the truth in this
[25:53] hour
[25:55] thank you for the
[25:57] all your hospitality you've been too
[25:58] good to me amen man you know you spoiled
[26:01] me but you know i i've always asked god
[26:04] like this
[26:05] you know you do it the least of my
[26:06] little ones you know all right to me i'm
[26:08] praying he'll reward each and every one
[26:10] of you
[26:11] for your goodness he said
[26:14] he would and i like how the prophet took
[26:16] that approach they said if he went to
[26:17] somebody's house he wouldn't even leave
[26:19] unless he asked for
[26:20] some water because he wanted them to be
[26:22] blessed right that's right so we should
[26:24] think the same way right people would be
[26:26] blessed if we've been around
[26:28] if we go with that right mental attitude
[26:30] toward undivided promising god
[26:32] you'll fulfill it he will feel his word
[26:34] for his word
[26:36] turn with me to the book of galatians
[26:37] tonight pray for me he preached me
[26:39] pretty hard this morning
[26:41] and
[26:42] i'm gonna depend on god like i always do
[26:44] but
[26:45] amen i believe you've come and helped me
[26:47] you said he would
[26:49] amen we just
[26:50] need to appreciate you pulling on the
[26:52] word this morning i believe god said
[26:54] something to us it'll help us in this
[26:55] journey

[31:25] where it says but the fruit of the
[31:26] spirit is love
[31:28] peace
[31:30] long-suffering gentleness
[31:33] goodness faith i want to talk about
[31:35] the partner of faith tonight i would
[31:38] like to talk about faithfulness
[31:40] just for a few moments tonight this
[31:43] afternoon
[31:44] we want to look at faith and
[31:46] faithfulness
[31:47] faith and faithfulness are closely
[31:50] linked
[31:51] faith being the foundation
[31:54] to all that we believe
[31:56] and all that we act upon amen but
[31:59] without faith it's impossible to please
[32:02] god amen
[32:03] and your faith
[32:05] generates inside you faithfulness
[32:08] to him and to his word
[32:10] right faith is the undeniable power
[32:13] through which we can realize the reality
[32:16] of things that are as yet
[32:19] unseen
[32:20] and count them as though they are
[32:23] faith brings a revelation from the
[32:26] prophet god said faith is a revelation
[32:28] knowing who you are see first of all i
[32:31] believe a lot of times the problem is
[32:32] around the message thank you by the way
[32:34] is a lot of times as people we don't
[32:36] really realize who we are right we don't
[32:39] realize who that really we don't not
[32:41] really come to the full maturity to
[32:43] realize that we are sons and daughters
[32:45] of god
[32:46] that we i think a lot of times as a
[32:49] natural types of spiritual i believe a
[32:51] lot of times satan has tried to steal
[32:53] our identity right just say that we're
[32:55] some old church store that's just going
[32:57] to a church or coming to a gathering but
[33:00] we are the bride of jesus christ i'm
[33:02] here to tell you that the word of god
[33:03] has identified me amen and it identifies
[33:07] you tonight as sons and daughters of god
[33:10] the very bride of jesus christ that's
[33:12] right amen
[33:14] and your actions
[33:16] speak louder than our words
[33:18] right
[33:19] when we have faith in god
[33:22] we act in faithful ways
[33:24] we have to faithful ways by attending
[33:26] coming to church uh praying like we
[33:29] should reading our bible like we should
[33:31] studying the message like we should
[33:34] listening to the tapes that's just
[33:36] faithful acts of your faith amen right
[33:41] is that
[33:42] acts of faithfulness is the
[33:44] demonstrations that we have true faith
[33:46] in the true the living god
[33:48] that we believe that whatever we ask him
[33:51] according to his will he will perform it
[33:54] amen right brother
[33:56] oh i'm thankful for that right
[34:01] we see that
[34:03] that fat acts of faith are the threads
[34:08] holding
[34:10] our belief in god together
[34:13] james once said
[34:15] faith without works is dead
[34:19] he said you say you
[34:20] he said you say you have faith he said
[34:23] i'll show you my faithfulness by my
[34:25] words
[34:28] you'll understand that these signs
[34:30] follow them that believe me
[34:32] it's the acts of the holy ghost having
[34:34] faith in god
[34:37] he testifies that you are faithful to
[34:38] him by those things following your life
[34:41] we're not looking for signs and wonders
[34:43] they follow us
[34:44] amen that's right i believe where we're
[34:47] not seeing as many signs and wonders as
[34:49] we should is because we're not faithful
[34:51] enough right amen how is he going to
[34:53] give us the great things if we're not
[34:55] faithful over the small things that's
[34:57] right i think a lot of times we've hit
[34:59] our talent
[35:00] you remember the man got three talents
[35:02] he kept it he went and he gave god back
[35:04] three more
[35:06] then the other one he gave him two
[35:08] he was they was faithful
[35:10] but he said oh you
[35:12] the one that he gave one thought well
[35:13] they don't mean much love me we said in
[35:15] church with that well i'm not a preacher
[35:17] i'm not a teacher i'm not this i'm not
[35:18] that i don't mean much you mean a whole
[35:20] lot
[35:21] to god
[35:23] you mean so much to god that he gave his
[35:24] very life for you right
[35:28] we see that
[35:30] he
[35:31] is desiring meaning to be more faithful
[35:33] right than ever
[35:35] he wants us to be faithful
[35:37] he desires meaning to be faithful right
[35:40] he doesn't draw things right just to
[35:42] testimony in my own life
[35:44] as a young minister
[35:45] i started out ministering you know my
[35:47] brain said find you a pulpit
[35:50] finds you a pulpit you know you preach
[35:51] to the trees you preach to the dogs and
[35:53] preach to the animals
[35:56] and
[35:57] so i said well you know the lord laid
[35:58] down my heart i got on the radio he gave
[36:01] me that desire
[36:02] i preached on the radio for a long time
[36:04] before the lord started opening doors to
[36:06] preaching
[36:07] around you know
[36:08] he was training me
[36:10] he was gonna see if i was faithful right
[36:12] right you know i i think it's i i know
[36:14] brother it has helped me right because
[36:17] it helped me to understand the bible
[36:20] help me to understand the message come
[36:21] right out of this file right because
[36:23] when he was on the radio you couldn't
[36:24] say brother brother said this you
[36:26] couldn't say it come out this man you
[36:28] showed it in the bible and the bible
[36:30] backs it up amen
[36:32] this message is back it's the bible up
[36:35] right come on
[36:38] the bible is the gun barrel the message
[36:40] of the sights
[36:42] it was not in this bible he brought
[36:43] himself an angel from heaven
[36:45] told me anything was in the bible i
[36:47] wouldn't believe it
[36:48] they said say that angel told you to
[36:49] baptize that way we believe you brother
[36:51] brother
[36:52] he said if he told me anything what he
[36:53] did i wouldn't believe it
[36:55] right then what about us
[36:57] if anybody tells us anything that wasn't
[36:59] in his bible we shouldn't be faithful to
[37:01] it we should say faithful to the word
[37:03] the word has been faithful to me in you
[37:05] that's right we serve a faithful god but
[37:08] anyway
[37:09] i preached on there for a while you know
[37:11] god just kept you know we kept and i had
[37:13] a desire
[37:14] you know god gives you the desire to do
[37:15] something brother death can you do it
[37:17] right he won't see if you're faithful
[37:19] you're standing because you know you
[37:20] don't know who's listening right you
[37:22] don't know you know how no people are
[37:24] pulling on you right you know he was
[37:25] saying if you're gonna stand here i'm
[37:27] gonna see if you're standing here make a
[37:28] fool out of yourself
[37:30] for me i said lord i stand here and spit
[37:32] all over this place
[37:34] for you
[37:36] and every time i was on that radio
[37:38] broadcast i believed god i trust god god
[37:41] was saying something to them people i
[37:42] don't know i don't know who it affected
[37:44] or who it condemned or who it brought to
[37:46] life but i said praise god you said you
[37:49] would do it said your word wouldn't come
[37:50] back boy all right

[39:53] faithful over your things here right if
[39:55] you're faithful what it gives you here
[39:57] he knows he can he can trust you over
[39:59] there
[40:00] for the saints of judge the earth if we
[40:02] can't judge things here how we gonna
[40:04] judge him over there right
[40:06] just want to know if you're doing
[40:07] faithful even paul challenged them over
[40:10] in correctness when they couldn't do it
[40:11] he said how dare you take one another to
[40:13] the law you being christians he said
[40:16] then let the lead stop him judge
[40:21] what happened humility right let the
[40:24] little kids judge you
[40:26] since you adults can't do it
[40:29] let the littlest ones let the least of
[40:31] the faith the youngest christians judge
[40:32] it man you ain't got to pray for not to
[40:34] believe god to give you the right answer
[40:36] then let them judge you right right
[40:38] that's right it should be the same way
[40:40] he wants us to be faithful
[40:43] faithful over his word
[40:45] the word
[40:46] p-i-s-t-i-s i don't know how you say
[40:48] that word by the way you might be able
[40:49] to say
[40:51] the original greek word most often
[40:53] translated
[40:55] as faith in the bible
[40:56] it means to be of a firm persuasion
[41:00] or you have a firm persuasion tonight
[41:03] if you ain't i'm asking god to give you
[41:05] a firm persuasion
[41:07] you know what it takes a lot to persuade
[41:08] people nowadays progress the hardest
[41:11] thing is to get one man to believe in
[41:14] another man
[41:17] that's why he said that's why he come in
[41:19] flesh right god did that he was gonna
[41:21] see if they'd believe in a man that's
[41:22] right he was gonna defy satan and prove
[41:25] satan wrong right
[41:26] they believed him
[41:28] and their sons followed him right
[41:31] it says the conviction
[41:33] which is based upon hearing
[41:35] and is used in the new testament always
[41:38] of faith in god or christ
[41:40] or a thing spiritual
[41:44] another word that means
[41:47] opposite of it is the apis to a apistos
[41:51] which means
[41:52] not worth
[41:54] of confidence and unbeliever
[41:57] either you have faith
[41:59] or you don't either you're a believer
[42:01] or you're a believer or an unbeliever
[42:04] i mean it's the three right
[42:06] we're one or the other right so i'm
[42:07] believing tonight i preaching to all
[42:09] believers
[42:10] that believe in this message
[42:12] i like what a little little phrase dl
[42:14] moody used one time he said he says deal
[42:17] when he says i want he said i i said
[42:21] he said once it says deal what he wants
[42:23] said i believe in a faith
[42:25] that you can see
[42:28] i figured you can see the manifestation
[42:31] of you believing right right there's a
[42:33] it's it has an outward work right you
[42:35] know my mother was the lord was when i
[42:37] was having around the world and i was
[42:39] serving the damn stuff she kept they
[42:41] said won't you just clean it cut that
[42:42] hair trim that beard look like somebody
[42:46] i said well mama went there no good
[42:48] clean up the outside
[42:49] if the inside's filthy
[42:51] you know what i think it's worth a lot
[42:52] of times is happening around the message
[42:54] we've tried to clean up the outside
[42:56] it's to let god take work on the inside
[42:59] he'll bring the hair along he'll bring
[43:02] the equip the women wearing the slits
[43:03] and the high heels and all the dresses
[43:05] and things they wear he'll stop all that
[43:08] he took that away from me brother saying
[43:10] my mother didn't have to tell me my
[43:11] parents didn't have time to cut my hair
[43:12] i personally had to clean up
[43:14] quit wearing those rock t-shirts quit
[43:17] acting like an idiot
[43:18] the holy ghost just took that away from
[43:20] me
[43:21] he said you'll have no more conscious
[43:23] which means no more desire for those
[43:24] things
[43:25] and that desire has changed and you're
[43:27] faithful to god you don't want to do
[43:28] anything to hurt him
[43:30] anything to bring him to bring him to
[43:32] the pain that he's already suffered from
[43:34] you right
[43:36] he said he wants to see he said i
[43:37] believe in the faith that you can see a
[43:40] living working faith that prompts action
[43:43] faith without works is like a man
[43:46] putting all his money into the
[43:47] foundation of a house
[43:50] and work without faith is like building
[43:52] a house on sand without any foundation
[43:55] right
[43:57] are you putting all your faith now
[43:58] you're working this
[43:59] this message
[44:00] in this foundation which is jesus christ
[44:02] this message is nothing more than jesus
[44:04] christ
[44:06] before he opened the seals he preached
[44:09] god in simplicity
[44:11] hiding himself
[44:13] and revealing himself in his word
[44:14] jesus christ the theme of the message
[44:16] jesus christ was saying yesterday today
[44:18] and forever unchangeable right
[44:30] faithfulness
[44:31] let's look at faithfulness just in the
[44:33] natural just for a few seconds this
[44:35] faithfulness is a vital part
[44:38] of human beings right in fact it is so
[44:40] important that without it society will
[44:43] collapse
[44:45] right we can have faith in what they
[44:46] even in the people that have built our
[44:48] cars that they build them right that we
[44:51] can drive we have faith that people who
[44:53] just construct this building that they
[44:54] build it right there they won't fall in
[44:56] on us when we come in here right we can
[44:58] have faith brother said you the same
[45:00] faith that you got to crank your cars
[45:01] the same faith god awkward operation
[45:05] every day of our life demands us
[45:08] an act of faith right that cares
[45:11] carries us into countless actions which
[45:14] are we are dependent
[45:16] on the faithfulness of others right
[45:19] we need to learn to depend on one
[45:20] another right
[45:22] instead of being so
[45:23] self-sufficient me myself right you know
[45:26] we need to be an outlet instead of an
[45:28] immigrant largely because yeah i call
[45:32] them desert houses
[45:34] you know because you go in there there's
[45:36] no fruit there's no water there's
[45:38] nothing there just saying
[45:41] you know we want to see some life on
[45:43] that light amen
[45:46] come into our presence and meet the very
[45:48] living god that we serve
[45:51] the fruits of the spirit right
[45:54] now we want to become so salty that they
[45:56] become so thirsty
[45:59] i believe one reason
[46:01] of the lack for faith and faithfulness
[46:03] is that so many of us have been wounded
[46:06] and scarred by dealings and
[46:08] relationships of others
[46:10] that we can't have faith and confidence
[46:12] in one another right
[46:22] it's hard for us to have faith in them
[46:23] again
[46:24] but you know what jesus still has faith
[46:26] in us when we make our mistakes we fall
[46:28] and make our thoughts in our prayers he
[46:29] still trusts us right because he
[46:31] believes his word is true then why don't
[46:33] we believe his words true
[46:35] he will bring us to that place paul
[46:37] calls the revelation he said whatever i
[46:39] have committed unto god that he will
[46:41] keep yep
[46:43] until the end
[46:44] amen do we not believe like that all
[46:46] right
[46:47] then why wouldn't you one day we're oh
[46:49] i'm a christian next day we're a sinner
[46:52] what's wrong with us
[46:54] what's wrong with us
[46:55] we need an experience with god we need
[46:57] to born again experience we need the
[46:59] baptism of the holy ghost
[47:02] that's why people are tossed that's why
[47:03] we see so many strange doctrines around
[47:05] the message right
[47:07] this will believe in that and this one
[47:08] it's their lack of faithfulness to the
[47:10] truth
[47:11] so he has beguiled them right paul said
[47:14] who hath bewitched you
[47:17] who has seduced you who has brought you
[47:19] you did run well why have you stopped
[47:21] right
[47:22] why have you could be faithful to the
[47:23] truth i've showed you he said oh timothy
[47:26] stand fast in the faith
[47:29] in the gospel i have preached right
[47:32] amen
[47:34] it's that simple you say oh that's so
[47:35] simple but yet it's so powerful
[47:39] in all this
[47:41] there's a positive
[47:43] god is always faithful
[47:45] he has no false advertising claims amen
[47:49] if he tells you something like the
[47:50] brothers talk illustrated about that
[47:51] they illustrate about the soap the
[47:53] detergent that you put in the water he
[47:55] said they just trained the city during
[47:56] the horse dishes he said boy that was a
[47:59] false house
[48:02] i believe preachers have set up a lot of
[48:03] false advertising
[48:07] oh no
[48:09] jesus said you you must be born again
[48:11] that's right amen all right
[48:14] oh but we we serve a god that has never
[48:17] made a false claim
[48:19] never made one false claim never put up
[48:21] one false fear board right
[48:24] like the cigarette advertisement
[48:26] advertised a young cowboy other woman
[48:28] had dressed so
[48:30] look so
[48:31] seductive to the world oh if i smoke
[48:33] i'll be cool
[48:34] but they don't show the end right the
[48:37] end
[48:38] see satan wants to show the beginning
[48:41] but he don't show you the end of it when
[48:43] they're laying down their throats rotted
[48:45] out of their laundry
[48:46] or
[48:53] i'm glad they started showing those
[48:54] things
[48:55] they'll start fighting against we would
[48:57] have never thought that that makes me
[48:58] think about this we would have never
[48:59] thought they would come up against
[49:00] cigarettes remember i'm saying it'll be
[49:02] a time where they'll
[49:04] be along and smoking
[49:06] when we first heard that
[49:08] man as many puffers if we got
[49:10] around the world there's no way
[49:12] but i'm glad they stopped it in the
[49:13] restaurant
[49:20] prophecy being fulfilled i'm like
[49:22] brother holman girl they say well you
[49:23] ain't got no scripture they asked him
[49:25] one time said bro homie ain't got no
[49:26] scripture on on smoking he said oh yes i
[49:29] do he's thinking
[49:31] you know what this stinker
[49:33] it stinks to a believer
[49:36] i mean even my man
[49:37] a man or woman
[49:39] and god delivers you from that thing
[49:41] yes
[49:57] it's awful i said thank god for those
[49:58] like crying i won't let him smoke no
[50:00] more i said praise god
[50:03] i hope they don't let you have
[50:04] cigarettes no man
[50:07] it didn't hurt me
[50:08] but it hurts the smoker's feelings
[50:12] but they're offended because of the word
[50:14] he said you're offended because of me or
[50:16] my words
[50:17] i'm thankful that god has come to that
[50:20] brothers of that eye that we're a human
[50:22] normal christian but we could sit down
[50:23] and don't have to worry about it right
[50:24] man going that smell like a smoke stack
[50:27] right when they come in church you walk
[50:28] in i know you when you you travel you
[50:31] know and you come into a place and just
[50:32] go to a place brother down you probably
[50:34] haven't had youtube or the way
[50:35] like minister brothers are going to
[50:37] look on venus trying to get some
[50:39] some gas or something going i mean it's
[50:40] like a smoke factory you're going down
[50:43] here you come to church
[50:44] never

[50:47] it

[51:26] and all all the glory we give to god
[51:28] it's so sweet to him
[51:30] he loves it
[51:32] then we ought to be faithful in giving
[51:33] it to him
[51:34] he
[51:43] he smoked pot you know he's young boy he
[51:45] becomes you know a friend i didn't hold
[51:46] that against him

[51:51] but he still tries to be our friend
[51:53] he'll tell me pray for him or something
[51:54] you know but uh he was coming through
[51:56] there and i said
[51:58] his name his nickname it called we're
[51:59] calling brownie
[52:00] and his last name was brown his name
[52:02] derek brown shouldn't call his name but
[52:04] he's a good friend
[52:05] i don't think he hears he does
[52:07] trying to offend you you better
[52:10] he kept that army said that
[52:12] he said no i come to an arsenal man

[52:24] owner i said he smelled it on you man
[52:26] yeah i said if i smell it he says man i

[52:30] all over you man you're wrecking in it
[52:32] he said you got anything
[52:34] to smell him i said no you have to take
[52:36] your clothes off and take a bath and get
[52:38] that stuff already
[52:39] but that's the way we're coming when
[52:40] sometimes we come to the house of god
[52:42] and we ain't being faithful we stink in
[52:44] his mind that's why we come here
[52:46] everyone comes here we got to be washed
[52:47] by the ground washed and cleaned by the
[52:49] washing of the water
[52:51] because we rub shoulders with sin all
[52:53] week when i come to the house god says
[52:55] god wash me cleanse me make me clean
[52:58] that i might stand in your sight
[53:00] clean and spotless i said sometimes god
[53:03] little iron hurts but i want you to get
[53:05] the wrinkles out too
[53:08] well that steam will bring bring the
[53:09] wrinkles out
[53:11] a lot of us need to learn
[53:17] oh i'm thankful that god is able to give
[53:18] us that let's look at this remote at
[53:21] boaz
[53:22] he's seen the faithfulness of ruth
[53:24] toward naomi
[53:26] an unbeliever look at that she was even
[53:29] named because you know
[53:31] really she was supposed to have no part
[53:33] right with the jews having no kind of
[53:35] inheritance at all
[53:38] and she was named that's like a lot of
[53:39] us we shouldn't have no part at all but
[53:42] god who's rich
[53:45] rich in grace has just took mine in your
[53:48] place that we have a place in here
[53:50] in this beautiful
[53:52] assembly of god that god has given us to
[53:54] be part of the bride of jesus christ
[53:56] he's seen something in her
[53:58] she told she said she made a stance she
[54:00] said
[54:01] and now here come over she said well
[54:03] wait a minute i can't be faithful you
[54:05] know and they was trying to do
[54:06] everything to discourage those two
[54:08] daughter-in-laws the other one just
[54:10] finally got scarcity
[54:11] i'll just go back to my own family right
[54:13] but that one said let your people be my
[54:16] people let your god be my god i say let
[54:19] this message be my message let the god
[54:22] of this message be my god
[54:24] all right brother amen
[54:26] oh i'm thankful for that
[54:28] god always the prophet said respects
[54:31] faithfulness
[54:32] faithfulness you say well i just come to
[54:33] you over there and i'll see if i'm
[54:34] getting nowhere you're getting somewhere
[54:35] amen that's right you're getting
[54:37] somewhere that's where they come back
[54:39] it's doing something
[54:40] every time we leave
[54:42] this church something happens
[54:44] every time we leave these doors brother
[54:46] said we need to leave better
[54:47] or worse but you know what we got to
[54:50] come with this attitude brother sam i
[54:51] know we all tried to i said always i've
[54:52] said lord help me i want to leave better
[54:55] right
[54:56] a lot of times we need worse
[54:59] with more problems
[55:01] than we have
[55:02] but i want you to have faith and i said
[55:03] god amen i'm gonna
[55:07] because you're faithful and father i'm
[55:08] faithful tonight to be here right now
[55:10] and i want your word to change my life
[55:14] he said
[55:15] we see here through all the ages
[55:18] god rewarded them for the loyalty
[55:20] and steadfastness to the original light
[55:24] as each age pulled away from the light
[55:27] his faithful messenger
[55:29] always turned them back to the word
[55:33] they counted it a joy to suffer for him
[55:35] amen we whine and murmur complain when
[55:37] god puts anything on us or allows
[55:39] something to happen he don't actually
[55:40] put it on us right but he allows it and
[55:42] then we get a grown man
[55:44] lord
[55:45] satan said he didn't love you he
[55:46] wouldn't done that yes he did he got it
[55:48] because he loved me
[55:50] he had confidence in you
[55:52] he had confidence in me we gotta get to
[55:54] that and say lord i'm gonna stand
[55:55] faithful right like joe the song said
[55:57] though he slayed me yet i trust him
[56:00] you gotta put your complete trust in god
[56:03] he said his messenger always tried to
[56:05] turn him back
[56:07] he said that counted as a joy
[56:09] he said reflect it
[56:11] it says they burned with the light of
[56:14] his life
[56:15] and reflected his love
[56:17] patience meekness temperance gentleness
[56:20] faithfulness and god back to them
[56:23] but back them up
[56:25] with signs and wonders right that's why
[56:27] we don't see as many signs than one as
[56:29] we should it's because we're not
[56:31] faithful enough right he'll back it up
[56:33] the prophet said he would he'll back it
[56:35] up
[56:36] right he'll leave a faithful out he'll
[56:37] back it up very well he's got to back
[56:40] his word up
[56:41] not because i said because he said amen
[56:44] all right
[56:45] look at this we've never heard of this
[56:46] man before
[56:48] except in the bible and never missing
[56:49] nowhere else but octopus
[56:52] my faithful
[56:53] martyr
[56:54] he was so faithful god said i want you
[56:56] to write his name in the book i wanted
[56:58] him to be a memorial right he was
[57:01] faithful
[57:02] unto death
[57:04] he's wondering he's not actually telling
[57:06] about for us to go to a natural death so
[57:08] much right but he's asking men you will
[57:10] mean you be faithful to the death of
[57:12] self-will
[57:15] and become faithful to his will all
[57:16] right glory
[57:19] we see that supreme faith will give
[57:21] supreme grace for the hour for a supreme
[57:25] that we're living in
[57:26] i like what gentleman said what the book
[57:28] of john said lord jesus said he gave him
[57:31] grace
[57:32] for grace right double grace a double
[57:35] portion i like what the prophet said in
[57:37] the tithe church age he said i know your
[57:40] faith now he does not say here as he did
[57:43] to the pergamos church
[57:45] the church in pergamos
[57:48] you hold my faith but he is commending
[57:50] them for their faithfulness amen and as
[57:53] he does
[57:55] he always mentions their patience
[57:58] now faithfulness and patience go
[58:00] together
[58:01] boy that patience we don't want to talk
[58:02] about that because that kind of that's
[58:04] that's a hard one
[58:05] we're going to go through a lot of
[58:06] trials and get patience
[58:08] amen but they work together right
[58:10] he says in fact patience
[58:13] is the outcome of faithfulness
[58:17] so that shows you faithfulness
[58:19] thou known you've got patience to wait
[58:21] on god know he's god stand on his word
[58:26] he said for it says in james 1 3 the
[58:29] trying of your faith work of patience
[58:33] he said there is absolutely no other way
[58:36] in which you can gain patience
[58:38] unless you're faithful
[58:40] amen
[58:41] he said it has to come
[58:44] it has to come the trial of your faith
[58:47] romans 5 3 says said tribulation
[58:51] work of patience
[58:53] how highly the prophet says here in the
[58:55] church book he said how highly
[58:57] god regards this outworking of your
[58:59] patience it is seen in james 1 4 he said
[59:02] but let patience
[59:04] have our own perfect word that ye may be
[59:08] perfect and retire lacking nothing
[59:10] amen man that's why he said there is no
[59:13] law
[59:14] praise be to god
[59:16] god will for us
[59:18] god's will for us is perfection
[59:21] and perfection is patience waiting on
[59:24] god waiting for god
[59:26] this is the process of character
[59:28] development
[59:29] we have to go to the school of character
[59:32] i mean it's a rough thing
[59:35] that character development that's the
[59:37] heart that's the school of hard knocks
[59:39] amen
[59:41] he's building characters that we might
[59:42] be able to sit with him and ruin reign
[59:44] together with him he said
[59:47] he said how highly god has commended the
[59:49] saints
[59:50] of the dark ages
[59:52] patients patient as lambs led to the
[59:55] slaughter loving
[59:57] faithfully they serve god
[1:00:00] he said that is all they wanted out of
[1:00:03] life
[1:00:03] is that all you want out of your life
[1:00:05] tonight ask yourself is that all you
[1:00:07] want to have your life tonight is to
[1:00:08] serve god
[1:00:10] and to please him
[1:00:12] in all of your ways right
[1:00:13] that'll be the very desire of every
[1:00:15] christian here tonight
[1:00:16] that'll be your soul desire
[1:00:20] he said that's all they wanted
[1:00:22] just service to the lord yeah oh my he
[1:00:25] has served us so great can we not be can
[1:00:27] we not be ambassadors let me serve him
[1:00:29] like he served us
[1:00:32] he says how great
[1:00:34] was it to be
[1:00:36] was there war for their reward to be
[1:00:39] man i am so thankful for that i like
[1:00:42] what jesus was talking to simon peter
[1:00:45] here
[1:00:46] in saint luke 22 31 he says and the lord
[1:00:49] said unto simon
[1:00:51] simon behold satan has desire to have
[1:00:54] you
[1:00:56] and he desired to have me and you too
[1:00:58] you better believe he desires you
[1:01:01] hey when god got us he got mad
[1:01:04] he lost one of his converts
[1:01:07] hey we went perverted we was converted
[1:01:09] right amen
[1:01:12] he says he has desire
[1:01:14] to have you that he may sift you as
[1:01:18] wheat
[1:01:19] satan wants to sift you but you know
[1:01:21] what through that sifting process
[1:01:23] it brings all that out getting the dross
[1:01:25] had to come when the fire come on the
[1:01:27] gold and all that draws come out and he
[1:01:29] might push that away
[1:01:31] the very guy that had to go i like what
[1:01:33] i like what the
[1:01:34] one little thing was said in there said
[1:01:36] that the the the oneness i've got who
[1:01:40] said this he said lord bring it back to
[1:01:41] me
[1:01:42] he said that
[1:01:44] the master
[1:01:45] is never never very far from the furnace
[1:01:49] the face of the first when his gold is
[1:01:51] in the fire all right
[1:01:53] amen amen
[1:01:54] we've seen that in the testimony with
[1:01:56] the three hebrew children
[1:01:59] he said put them in the fire and i'll
[1:02:01] show you they'll come out reflecting me
[1:02:03] right
[1:02:05] he said in saint luke 22 13 he says oh i
[1:02:08] love this
[1:02:09] same thing for me he says but i have
[1:02:11] prayed for thee
[1:02:12] that thy faith failed not
[1:02:16] and when thou art converted
[1:02:18] strengthen
[1:02:19] thy brother man say peter couldn't do
[1:02:21] that for nobody he was doing a lot of
[1:02:22] good preaching right but he couldn't
[1:02:24] straighten his brother until he was
[1:02:25] converted right hey judas preached good
[1:02:27] sure but he went converting he couldn't
[1:02:29] go to pentecost right now you're getting
[1:02:31] given to the experience with god i like
[1:02:33] what it says in
[1:02:34] second corinthians 5 7 he says for we
[1:02:37] walk
[1:02:38] by faith not by sight
[1:02:41] not by sight for faith is the sense of
[1:02:44] things hope for the evidence of things
[1:02:45] not seen right
[1:02:47] people say oh if i said i believe it
[1:02:49] he said old doubt and thomas
[1:02:51] you didn't believe he said but blessed
[1:02:53] are they who haven't seen and believed
[1:02:55] they're greater they're greater they
[1:02:57] have a greater reward than me all of us
[1:02:59] haven't seen the prophet never been in
[1:03:00] one of his meetings yet we believe
[1:03:03] we believe it's nothing but the truth
[1:03:06] second corinthians 13 5 it says examine
[1:03:08] yourselves
[1:03:10] whether you be in
[1:03:12] the faith
[1:03:13] not just in your faith now defense
[1:03:16] he said prove yourselves
[1:03:19] unbelief is unfaithfulness the word
[1:03:21] means unfaithfulness
[1:03:23] faithless
[1:03:24] one of faith weakness of faith
[1:03:27] oh my honey young man when the apostles
[1:03:30] come and try to cast out the epileptic
[1:03:31] spirit out of the young boy he said
[1:03:35] oh ye
[1:03:39] i like what the boys did and said he
[1:03:41] said lord
[1:03:42] help thou my unbelief right
[1:03:44] i like what paul said in first
[1:03:46] corinthians 16 13 he says watch ye stand
[1:03:48] fast in the faith i am that's right amen
[1:03:53] the unity of the faith
[1:03:55] the faith of the gospel right to your
[1:03:58] established in the faith
[1:04:00] the faith the faith the faith for this
[1:04:03] hour the revelation of this hour the
[1:04:05] revelation of who you are who god is
[1:04:08] amen that you're part of his glorious
[1:04:10] bride
[1:04:11] i think what paul commended timothy in
[1:04:13] here in 1st timothy 3 9. he said holding
[1:04:16] the mystery
[1:04:18] of the faith
[1:04:19] in pure conscience right
[1:04:21] that's the key right to defeat today
[1:04:24] in a pure conscience right right having
[1:04:27] no desire for nothing but jesus christ
[1:04:31] god has always been faithful
[1:04:33] that's what the prophet said we know
[1:04:35] that too he said he does not change due
[1:04:37] to age
[1:04:39] we're changing today
[1:04:40] but we're changing from glory
[1:04:42] to glory he's changing me right he does
[1:04:45] not change
[1:04:46] as to place
[1:04:48] and does not change as to his word right
[1:04:51] then why are people around the message
[1:04:52] trying to change the message
[1:04:54] a lot of people are trying to change the
[1:04:55] bible to make it fit in but we need the
[1:04:57] bible to change this to make us feel
[1:04:59] that's right there's the key to it
[1:05:02] right brother
[1:05:03] i want to ask you a question tonight
[1:05:05] have you ever this afternoon have you
[1:05:07] ever faced a task that seemed beyond
[1:05:09] your strength or your ability
[1:05:11] so many times each and one of us have
[1:05:13] right
[1:05:14] simply overwhelming
[1:05:16] obstacles
[1:05:18] we didn't know how to handle
[1:05:20] but who was faithful he was faithful
[1:05:23] he said ah
[1:05:25] be faithful i'll keep lori if you'll
[1:05:28] stand in the faith right then i'll be
[1:05:30] faithful to you
[1:05:32] god will never leave us not forsake us
[1:05:35] he said i'll be with you even in you to
[1:05:37] the end right i like what it says in
[1:05:39] lamentations three
[1:05:41] turn within the lamentations chapter
[1:05:43] three
[1:05:44] read a little something right here
[1:05:46] the prophet jeremiah
[1:05:48] 3 22-23
[1:05:50] he said it is of the lord's mercies
[1:05:53] that we are not consumed
[1:05:55] you don't think satan desires to consume
[1:05:57] me in you
[1:05:58] you better believe he does right
[1:06:01] he said because his compassions
[1:06:05] failed right oh my what a faithful god
[1:06:09] he said they are new
[1:06:11] every morning
[1:06:12] he said great is thy family
[1:06:15] oh my we can't exhaust them brother then
[1:06:18] we don't try to exhaust but a lot of
[1:06:19] times we make mistakes but he's an
[1:06:22] inexhaustible god
[1:06:24] he said i'm gonna wipe what you did out
[1:06:26] yesterday because you repented i'm gonna
[1:06:28] give you a new portion all right this
[1:06:30] morning man every day he's wiping our
[1:06:33] slates clean
[1:06:35] and he's faithful
[1:06:36] he not only
[1:06:38] forgives us
[1:06:39] but he forgets
[1:06:41] amen and the greatest thing in mind in
[1:06:42] your life the battle that we fight the
[1:06:44] most is to forgive ourselves right
[1:06:47] now that he's faithful that he forgive
[1:06:49] us
[1:06:50] then we must learn to forgive ourselves
[1:06:52] that's why we live under so much
[1:06:53] condemnation is because we have not
[1:06:55] caught the revelation to forgive
[1:06:57] ourselves
[1:06:59] if he's able to forgive us then why
[1:07:00] don't we forgive ourselves but we let
[1:07:02] satan carry that same old cloud over our
[1:07:05] life day after day
[1:07:07] moment after moment hour after hour
[1:07:09] until he beats us over the head with
[1:07:12] things that god don't even see
[1:07:14] god don't even see it
[1:07:16] right i like how the song says it says
[1:07:18] what sins
[1:07:19] are you talking about
[1:07:21] i don't remember them
[1:07:22] anymore
[1:07:24] man
[1:07:24] what about it god he don't really forget
[1:07:26] he just posed it over there right into
[1:07:29] the sea of forgetfulness and then puts
[1:07:31] up a sign no fishing that's right i'll
[1:07:32] tell you tonight be careful where you
[1:07:34] fish because the game warden will get
[1:07:36] you
[1:07:36] you don't have license to fish in
[1:07:38] everybody's life
[1:07:40] maybe when it goes under blood be
[1:07:41] careful what you pull out i like that my
[1:07:44] pastor said it one time so be careful if
[1:07:46] you dig up that old dead man you'll find
[1:07:47] yourself caring in yourself
[1:07:50] so we have to be very careful
[1:07:53] god has
[1:07:54] given we need to give everything to god
[1:07:57] and trust all right
[1:07:59] we have to trust god for everything
[1:08:02] right believe god for everything brother
[1:08:03] says i wish i could just trust him just
[1:08:05] trust him for everything he said but you
[1:08:07] know the people don't let me the world
[1:08:09] the way it is it won't let me do it
[1:08:12] here's a life principle
[1:08:14] we're dealing with faithfulness we have
[1:08:16] a gift or a talent
[1:08:19] you use it faithfully god increases it
[1:08:21] so you can do more not less
[1:08:25] more right the increase of your talent
[1:08:28] means that you do more not less i see a
[1:08:29] lot of times the increase of the talent
[1:08:31] brother samuel death is what they do and
[1:08:33] then they get god increases them but
[1:08:35] they start doing less
[1:08:36] less unless they start reading less and
[1:08:38] start praying unless we see a lot of
[1:08:40] preachers doing that right you get less
[1:08:41] but it says more
[1:08:43] amen he wants more right he's not
[1:08:46] satisfied god's a moving god all right
[1:08:48] let me know the way so like them spirits
[1:08:50] those anointings are moving they don't
[1:08:52] match up they're moving forward they're
[1:08:54] faithful they're fighting every day
[1:08:56] right
[1:08:57] keeping the devils off of me sorry amen
[1:09:00] oh i'm so thankful for his grace
[1:09:02] turn with me to isaiah 53 i'm trying to
[1:09:04] hurry hey man you're in a hurry
[1:09:06] amen let god have his way
[1:09:08] amen
[1:09:09] i love him
[1:09:11] i just love this word this word is so
[1:09:12] rich
[1:09:13] just a simple
[1:09:15] little thing but principles that we need
[1:09:16] to live by
[1:09:18] stand by
[1:09:20] you know it's not the big foxes
[1:09:22] that's for the vine it's the small ones
[1:09:24] the little things we leave unturned
[1:09:26] brothers in the box that we leave undone
[1:09:29] the small foxes
[1:09:31] it's that little bitty worm that eats on
[1:09:32] the leaf
[1:09:34] it's that little bitty worm that gets
[1:09:35] down there and crawl eats on the roots
[1:09:37] and kills it right
[1:09:39] isaiah 53 said
[1:09:41] challenging me and you
[1:09:43] who has believed our report to whom is
[1:09:45] the arm of the lord revealed
[1:09:48] challenges the word report
[1:09:50] the word report means to give an account
[1:09:53] of relate tale to serve as a carrier of
[1:09:57] the message man are you willing have you
[1:10:00] released his report so much that you're
[1:10:01] faithful in this message are you a
[1:10:03] carrier of this message
[1:10:06] that you're living the life that jesus
[1:10:08] lives right he's living his life through
[1:10:11] you now
[1:10:15] have you believed his report
[1:10:18] is he going to find us in that day
[1:10:21] shall the son of man find faith
[1:10:24] right shall he find faithfulness
[1:10:26] so he found fabulous i still believe in
[1:10:28] the message the pure message not some
[1:10:30] strange doctrine some wild idea but the
[1:10:33] plain simple message the gospel
[1:10:36] is he gonna find you faithful to it
[1:10:39] believe in it well if you lose your
[1:10:41] friends your family whatever is 10
[1:10:43] faithful all right all right
[1:10:46] this message is a separator i found that
[1:10:48] out
[1:10:50] it brings a separation
[1:10:52] you lose friends
[1:10:54] you lose family
[1:10:55] and i'm telling you but i'll tell you
[1:10:57] what i haven't lost because i've won
[1:10:59] i've gained jesus
[1:11:01] i'm a winner as the song says either way
[1:11:04] amen i'm so thankful for that i want to
[1:11:07] turn to daniel i'm going to try to stop
[1:11:08] right here i'm going to turn to daniel
[1:11:10] look at those three faithful servants
[1:11:12] here for just a minute
[1:11:14] and challenge our faith tonight
[1:11:17] daniel chapter 3
[1:11:19] 16 and 18.
[1:11:21] here's shadrach meshach and if we know
[1:11:23] this proclamation went out there's a
[1:11:24] sound of this the music and all this
[1:11:26] going that they'll bow down to this
[1:11:28] image but i said that image was the
[1:11:30] image of daniel right a godly man
[1:11:32] henry's by the image of the prophet and
[1:11:34] we see him bound now
[1:11:36] now
[1:11:37] it's a very dangerous thing
[1:11:39] hey when that one when john fell into
[1:11:41] worship that angel
[1:11:43] he said don't worship me i'm one of your
[1:11:44] brethren
[1:11:46] no true man of god will accept worship
[1:11:48] paul and silas they wouldn't accept it
[1:11:51] when they started telling them you're
[1:11:52] this you're zeus and you're this god and
[1:11:54] that god they begin to rinse their
[1:11:55] clothes off and say we're men we're a
[1:11:57] brother like you right
[1:12:01] but i like what they said right here it
[1:12:02] says shadrach meshach and abednego
[1:12:04] answer that to the king and pass this
[1:12:06] proclamation just to shorten it for me
[1:12:09] we are not careful to answer thee in
[1:12:11] this matter
[1:12:13] he said if it be so our god whom we
[1:12:15] serve is able to deliver us from the
[1:12:18] burning
[1:12:19] fiery furnace but i like this part right
[1:12:21] here and he will deliver us
[1:12:23] out of that handle king but i like verse
[1:12:26] 18 he said but if not
[1:12:29] be it known unto thee o king
[1:12:32] they wasn't scared that we will not
[1:12:35] serve thy gods now worship the golden
[1:12:38] image which thou has set up
[1:12:41] i like that if not faith
[1:12:43] all right lord if you don't deliver me
[1:12:46] i'm still going to serve you
[1:12:48] lord if you don't heal me i'm still
[1:12:50] going to believe you
[1:12:51] lord i believe it i'm standing on your
[1:12:54] promise
[1:12:56] may have not faith
[1:12:57] if not it be your will then father let
[1:12:59] your will be done we will not okay
[1:13:03] bow to any of your gods or any or the
[1:13:06] golden image
[1:13:09] that's right satan wants me to bow to an
[1:13:11] image
[1:13:12] instead
[1:13:14] to the god right he's trying to get the
[1:13:16] bow to images of men we got a lot of
[1:13:18] images of men around the message but we
[1:13:20] need to bow to the truth of god
[1:13:23] i'm thankful for god's grace thank god
[1:13:25] for his mercy
[1:13:27] i like this new challenge
[1:13:29] isaiah challenged us as we stand this
[1:13:32] afternoon
[1:13:33] challenged us
[1:13:35] half we believed his report right right
[1:13:38] i want you as we stand
[1:13:41] we ask our step father
[1:13:44] i'm not trying to say i don't believe
[1:13:45] lord but father i want my faith to be in
[1:13:48] the right place amen where i can be
[1:13:50] faithful
[1:13:52] and who else
[1:13:54] this age
[1:13:56] that i very out we live in god has
[1:13:58] has give us this report
[1:14:02] and to whom
[1:14:03] is the arm of the lord revealed to me in
[1:14:05] you
[1:14:06] that was the arm of the lord this
[1:14:08] message is almost the lord that has
[1:14:09] gathered us
[1:14:11] up to his bosom up to his side to
[1:14:13] worship him with spirit and truth
[1:14:16] we're so thankful for his grace
[1:14:18] faithfulness a simple little thing but
[1:14:21] faithfulness is so powerful because god
[1:14:23] honors it
[1:14:25] right right if you're not a faithful of
[1:14:26] the small things and how will you be
[1:14:28] faithful over the great things right
[1:14:30] there's small things
[1:14:31] we need to stand faithful to god and be
