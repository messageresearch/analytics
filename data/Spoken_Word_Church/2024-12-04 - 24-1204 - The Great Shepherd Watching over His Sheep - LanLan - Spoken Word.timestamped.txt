[33:51] true the most people that uh that can
[33:54] profess Christianity they seem to have
[33:57] such a hard struggling time to hold on I

[35:34] of he asked uh Peter he said Simon son
[35:39] of junah lovest thou

[36:39] time Peter was thinking that the master
[36:44] was doubting his love for him but you
[36:47] know baham said that Jesus was only uh
[36:50] he was only doing what what Jesus was
[36:53] doing is to make sure that his sheep

[40:53] Shepherd
[40:55] I I remember the uh the story of bham
[40:59] when he was in the Oriental
[41:02] country and uh somebody was driving for
[41:05] him and uh suddenly all the vehicles
[41:10] stopped and he was wondering why it
[41:13] stopped they stopped and then uh after a
[41:16] while uh they saw a bunch of of sheep
[41:21] and then somebody The Herder was uh the
[41:24] shepherd was leading them and baram said
[41:27] that uh he saw uh things that could be
[41:30] eaten by this by by the Sheep but the
[41:32] Sheep did not touch anything anything of
[41:35] them H Allelujah and then he asked the
[41:38] driver why is it that the ship didn't
[41:41] eat H Allelujah and the driver said that
[41:45] uh the Sheep will not eat unless the
[41:49] shepherd will tell them Allelujah to it
[41:52] amen and then he said and then uh uh
[41:56] this driver told him told banham that
[42:00] uh uh you know there's a lot of you know
[42:04] people uh hering different uh uh
[42:09] different uh kind of animals some of
[42:12] them they are Hing uh cows and camels
[42:16] and donkeys and goats and sheep and all
[42:20] of them they are called past H Shepherds
[42:25] hallelujah amen but the difference
[42:29] between The Shepherd of the ship and The
[42:31] Shepherd of those cows and camels and
[42:34] everyone on and all of them that the
[42:38] Shepherds during night time they go home
[42:42] and all their cattles are left out in
[42:44] the field but The Shepherd of the ship
[42:48] amen H Allelujah they lay down among his
[42:52] sheep he said they all eat from the same
[42:55] field but he said
[42:57] Barham the strange thing about this is
[43:00] that the shepherd will watch over them
[43:03] and correct each one through the day but
[43:06] when night time comes the donkeys and
[43:09] the camels and the goats go out in the
[43:11] field but the sheer takes the ship in
[43:16] the shiple I said oh brother I want to
[43:20] be a sheep don't you and he said I often
[43:24] wondered what the St John 10 mean when
[43:27] he said I am the door to the shipold how
[43:30] could he being a man yet be a door right
[43:34] and I asked uh this good man the
[43:37] shepherd never lays down
[43:39] until he has counted amen he has counted
[43:43] every ship and then when he lays down he
[43:46] lays ac across the door and the ship
[43:50] will never go over the shepherd or the
[43:53] wolf cannot get to the ship without
[43:55] crossing the shepherd I said I'm so glad
[43:58] to be a sheep this time trials may come
[44:00] and go but some to be a sheep brother
[44:04] some glorious day he's going to take us
[44:07] to the shipold when the Sun goes down at
[44:11] the end of the day brothers and sisters
[44:13] that great sheer Shepherd will gather
[44:17] all his sheep and none of them will be
[44:19] left amen you remember now when Jesus uh
[44:23] he he gave a a parable about the the the
[44:27] shepherd with 100 sheep Hallelujah he
[44:31] already got the the 190 19 the 19 uh the
[44:36] 99 but he has to find that Hallelujah
[44:41] one ship and he will not allow
[44:43] Hallelujah that one ship will be lost
[44:45] amen hallelujah that's why even Bram
[44:47] said that Hallelujah when that last
[44:50] predestinated seed Hallelujah will come
[44:53] then the rupture will take place no one
[44:56] will be left no that's why the ministers
[44:59] the fold Ministry are doing everything
[45:02] they can Allelujah just to find that
[45:05] last predestinated SE Hallelujah and the
[45:08] Shepherds lying among his sheep watching
[45:11] to see that those little fellow
[45:13] Hallelujah he makes sure that those
[45:15] little fellow come into the kingdom in
[45:18] the right way Hallelujah I'm so glad
[45:21] that he's in on duty day and night
[45:24] Hallelujah he promised what his
[45:28] promises I will not leave you nor
[45:31] forsake you I will be with you even in
[45:34] you until the end of the world Amen
[45:37] Hallelujah if the Under Undertaker puts
[45:40] us hallelujah one of his ship under the
[45:43] ground and
[45:45] shoveled uh six six foot of dirt on top
[45:49] of him on top of him

[45:56] eyes of that sheep

[46:39] and to greet me and help me carry my
[46:43] luggages although I I don't allow him to
[46:45] do it Allelujah but he you know he
[46:49] always insist to help me right H
[46:53] Allelujah and uh one time I was a about
[46:57] to travel to Arkansas I was about to
[46:59] drive uh for if not I'm not mistaken
[47:03] about uh 12 hours
[47:05] drive and I had to leave at 5:00 in the

[47:15] 4:00 and then I walk slowly to the
[47:20] bathroom and took shower Allelujah
[47:23] trying to not to disturb them I believe
[47:26] it's too early Allelujah in the morning
[47:30] and there I I was uh thinking they're
[47:34] sleeping you know and after I finished
[47:38] the packing up my my things and I walk

[48:12] sisters hallelujah it's only for a while
[48:16] one
[48:17] day Hallelujah we will see him again
[48:21] Hallelujah that's why even David he says

[48:30] art with me my rod and my stuff they
[48:33] comfort me
[48:36] hallelujah it's you know a little bit
[48:39] sad because we don't see him right now
[48:43] but I believe that he is in a better
[48:45] Hallelujah in a better place than we
[48:49] have H Allelujah and even job the oldest
[48:52] book in the Bible he got no scripture to
[48:55] read in his day
[48:57] Hallelujah but God spoke to him through
[49:00] his creation he mentioned about the
[49:02] stars and the Orion and the pades and
[49:05] all this Allelujah God's creation and
[49:09] then he said for there is a hope of a
[49:11] tree if it be cut down that it will
[49:14] Sprout again and that the tender Branch
[49:17] thereof will not will not cease though
[49:19] the root thereof walks old in the earth
[49:21] and the stuck thereof die in the ground
[49:24] yet through the scent of the what of
[49:26] water

[49:39] change come amen Thou shalt call and I
[49:42] will answer thee amen hallelujah thou
[49:44] Willl have a desire to the work of thine
[49:48] hands Hallelujah I believe that if God
[49:54] Allelujah
[49:57] I believe he believed I mean job believe
[50:00] that if there is a Resurrection on this
[50:02] yes creation the trees God is also a God
[50:07] hallelujah he is also Hallelujah a God
[50:10] who created men amen hallelujah that's
[50:13] why he said for I know that my redeemer
[50:15] liveth and that he shall stand at the
[50:18] lat day upon the Earth amen and though
[50:20] after my skin worms destroy this body
[50:23] eat up this body Hallelujah yet in My
[50:28] Flesh in this flesh I shall see God Whom
[50:32] Shall uh whom I shall see for myself and
[50:36] not my eye Shall Behold and not
[50:39] another though my reins be consumed
[50:42] within Me Not Another
[50:47] Hallelujah now God is omnipresent

[51:37] there just like Daniel yeah yeah
[51:42] Hallelujah he went into
[51:44] Babylon but he proposed himself that he
[51:47] was not going to defy himself Allelujah
[51:50] with King Smith right Hallelujah he was
[51:53] nothing to do with the world though he
[51:55] had to live among among them people but
[51:58] he purposed in himself that he was not
[52:00] going to defy him himself with the
[52:03] things of the world Hallelujah and one
[52:06] day the king threw him into the lion's
[52:10] den
[52:14] Hallelujah if I make my bed in hell thou
[52:17] are there amen
[52:20] hallelujah and because he was
[52:24] walking H Allelujah in the line of
[52:27] duty Hallelujah he was a sheep of that
[52:32] great
[52:33] Shepherd if I make my bed in hell behold
[52:36] thou are there amen and maybe before
[52:39] Daniel dropped Hallelujah into the
[52:43] ground that were there amen he was
[52:46] already there amen that Pillar of Fire
[52:49] was already there amen you
[52:51] know all wild
[52:54] animals they afraid fire
[52:57] Hallelujah that's why they could not

[53:03] before Daniel Hallelujah went into the
[53:07] pit th were there amen hallelujah amen
[53:12] and you know brothers and sisters maybe
[53:13] at the time this you know these people
[53:16] who got in way on
[53:20] Daniel because the king had uh you know
[53:24] gave him uh special treatment
[53:27] he he got a nice house maybe he got a
[53:29] nice bed Hallelujah and maybe at that
[53:34] time said oh now Daniel if you survive
[53:37] from The Lion and you are now lying on
[53:41] the ground
[53:44] Hallelujah but the thing that they
[53:46] didn't
[53:47] know Hallelujah Daniel at that night he
[53:52] got the smoothest
[53:54] pillow which is the skin of the the lion
[53:57] you know and warm with the body of the
[54:00] lion Hallelujah because before he went
[54:04] into the lion's den behold Thou Art
[54:08] there am Hallelujah
[54:12] believe am just like the three Hebrew
[54:16] children H Allelujah and they decided
[54:19] not to bow down to the image of the of
[54:22] King
[54:24] Nebuchadnezzar but before the threw them
[54:27] into the fairy
[54:29] fness the fourth man was already there
[54:32] amen hallelujah amen because they were
[54:35] faithful sheep of God Amen Hallelujah
[54:39] and maybe people that were watching them
[54:41] were so worried what would happen to
[54:44] them Hallelujah but if they were so
[54:48] worried for this uh three Hebrew
[54:53] children the great Shepherd is more
[54:55] worried for
[54:57] them and I like how reham dramatized it

[1:17:54] at the time I believe he

[1:17:59] why that he
[1:18:02] still came for that
[1:18:06] invitation and even a hypocrite the
[1:18:09] invitation of a hypocrite

[1:19:16] encouraging us to pray always to
[1:19:20] pray he said ask what you will he is the
[1:19:24] the one who is telling us to ask do you
[1:19:28] think after telling us to ask and then
[1:19:33] when we
[1:19:34] ask he will not give what we
[1:19:39] need
[1:19:46] Hallelujah saying there was a city there
[1:19:49] was in a city a judge which feared not
[1:19:52] God neither regard regarded men right
[1:19:55] and there was a widow in that City and
[1:19:57] she came unto him saying AV me of mine

[1:20:06] though I fear not God nor regarded man
[1:20:10] yet because this Widow troubleth me I
[1:20:13] will avenge her lest by her continual
[1:20:15] coming she weary me and the Lord said
[1:20:19] hear what the unjust Jud sayi
[1:20:25] Jesus he was
[1:20:28] comparing the best father and the evil

[1:42:37] say just for a minute especially when
[1:42:40] brother lanan pulled out the the the
[1:42:43] calculator uh something I because I love
[1:42:47] math and and I've always I've always
[1:42:50] been drawn to the universe uh because
[1:42:52] that's God's Great creation it's his
[1:42:54] first Bible that's right and so I I did
[1:42:57] some a little math one time and and I
[1:42:59] and sometimes when I go different places
[1:43:01] I share it because it means so much to
[1:43:03] me amen but you know the prophet said we
[1:43:06] have the first Bible was the
[1:43:08] Stars right the second Bible was the
[1:43:10] pyramid third Bible is this Bible right
[1:43:13] here right okay so this Bible right here
[1:43:17] King James version has
[1:43:20] 3,170
[1:43:22] something,
[1:43:24] letters and we don't know how big the
[1:43:27] universe is but the scientists take a
[1:43:29] guess at it yeah and the last I heard
[1:43:31] there was 100 billion galaxies wow and
[1:43:37] each one of those galaxies they have
[1:43:40] different sizes but they average about a
[1:43:42] hundred billion
[1:43:44] stars so when you do the math it took
[1:43:49] God
[1:43:52] 37,5 00 galaxies to represent one letter
[1:43:55] in this Bible oh Hallelujah so when you
[1:43:59] think that you have exhausted yeah
[1:44:02] anything in this word of God right the
[1:44:06] word faith you just covered 100 over
[1:44:11] 160,000 galaxies with 100 billion stars
