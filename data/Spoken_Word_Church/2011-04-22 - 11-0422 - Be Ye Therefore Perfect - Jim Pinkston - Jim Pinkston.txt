through the opening of the word and how does the word come he's in his ministry so we believe the fful ministry is for the perfecting of the Saints to bring us the message that we can Feast on and have a wonderful time so we're looking forward to the time of brother Jim Pinkston from Wizard talk Kansas here with us for tonight tomorrow night 7:00 Sunday morning then will be our just the morning

from the world right on into the light of this hour it's just a wonderful time to live live in exciting times amen amen God bless youall take this time we won't be singing so uh the music positions may be dismissed so I'll just take this time to greet you the name of the Lord uh no stranger to the South I am a southerner that's the first time I've been in Lula Georgia I didn't even know Lula Georgia and and Dale's Ville and Hillsville and all the vills I didn't know about that I'm not very good very good geographically uh but I have lived uh in uh Georgia uh up coming uh years ago actually in Florida Pastor Jacksonville for 16 years and of course now we're out in the midwest but I feel home I'm I'm in the South and that's not what makes me feel home but it's the kindred spirit of your pastor and brother Wade and uh uh your pastor was with us just not long ago ministering and really enjoyed that am and brother way has ministered for us several times we appreciate you letting him get away uh now he says he's getting away just to hunt deer and Bambi and whatnot but he comes by to preach to bless the saints of God and uh it's been a great blessing for us so we do appreciate that and uh uh we trust that we can return the uh return so I appreciate uh the confidence that uh your pastor would have in me to invite me uh to to his pull pit I know as a pastor we don't have revolving doors we want to be really selective in what we're hearing and what we're looking at and what's being preached and so forth because we're just living in a very treacherous hour very deceiving time so we want to be sure to examine everything right by by the words so want to just get into the word this evening I'm going to have you if you will while you're standing to turn uh to Genesis 17 and verse 1 Genesis 17 and verse in verse one and and uh of course this portion of scripture uh is going to deal with Abraham or God's dealing with Abraham and uh I began to uh I started oh I think it's been maybe a year ago just on a series on the life of Abraham uh considering how brother bams that was a type of the elect type of the church in the end time and so forth and Paul had written in uh Romans 4:12 he said we are to walk in the faith of the footsteps of Our Father Abraham and being the Royal Seed of Abraham so there's going to be a lot of a lot of parallels and similarities and so forth and what we can actually find in the life of Abraham we'll actually uh see much the same in our own life brother B said that is as the seat of God will go and so I want to take one verse of scripture and read it Genesis 17 And1 and when Abraham was 90 years old and nine the Lord appeared to Abram and said unto him I am the allmighty god walk before me and be thou perfect walk before me and be thou perfect can we just bow our heads just for a moment a word of prayer Heavenly Father we are thankful for uh this opportunity we have to address the saints of God the bride of Christ the Lamb's wife it's always a joy Lord as well as a privilege to minister these things that you put upon our heart that you've uh privileged US to understand in this hour and so I pray that you'd help us Lord uh as we commit our time to you father May our hearts be open as the eyes of our heart as we have sung Lord and may you speak to us may the Holy Spirit just uh deal with us individually and collectively Lord and may we say the things that would be pleasing to you and that would be helpful father may we may we stand like the sons of isachar who had an understanding of the times knew what Israel was to do or the bride and desire must be uh must be prepared that's right uh with the word in this hour father because we want to know what we are to do and what's taking place what's going on as the prophet of God St so we want to stay in the word watch uh watch the the things unfold has been prophesied and so father may we just now experience your nearness Your Love move us forward in the faith tonight dear God we'll ask it in the lovely name of the Lord Jesus Christ and all of God's people said amen amen God bless you you may be seated uh if you will it's hard the challenge of a Preacher as myself and I don't know if brother uh how he ministers and series and things like that but I know that that I have for a number of years right and it's uh it's always easy to uh to turn down invitations to get out and preach because of the effort it takes I think to put everything together uh when you're at your home Church you have the luxury of going 40 Services 50 services but such is not the case when you go out so uh it takes a lot of time and I invited I think maybe last year and I just no I'll just leave that to the Evangelist but uh uh the last time uh brother Wade brother Samuel came they said that we're not leaving till you give us a date so they did leave and that was because I gave them a date so this is the day that it worked out uh so I thought well we just take something uh and I probably changed um I probably changed my mind several times on what to what to minister you know it it it's not a lack it's just just there's just an abundance of things they say well so which direction do we go and so uh as a matter of fact I've prepared all week and things like that and just something didn't feel right and I got up this morning about 7:00 we had to be at the airport about 10:00 so I got up and I so once again tried to condense a 40 sermon series uh to present so so I I I trust the Lord will help us am uh tonight and I will say this uh that uh that if if I say something that's contrary to what's taught here in the Tabernacle brother Dale he's your pastor he's ordained to lead you through you just chalk it up to my ignorance and just say bless him Lord and uh like brother Ram said he said just uh uh just spit out the seat he to fin just spit out the seed so uh we're just in that hour where it's just very critical it's very crucial and uh so uh and I believe eventually the ministry will be on the same page the lady will be on the same page I believe it's Isaiah 58 and 53 and8 right in there there that says uh uh it said when the Lord would redeem Zion would restore Zion uh and the voice would be lifted up the Watchman on the wall would lift the voice up and uh they would see eye to eye and sing the same song when we hear ear to ear I believe we'll begin to see eye to ey and so there has been a voice that has declared a word in this hour and that's all that we that's all we have to live for and it's all we have to preach so we trust it'll be a blessing today so it was it was these words that I had read when we got down this far in our series walk before me and be thou perfect amen and then of course it reminded me that we as the children of Abraham we've been given the same commission basically as Abraham right who is the father of our faith right and uh and it was these words walk before me and be thou perfect uh the sermon title tonight will be this be ye there for be therefore perfect let me let me read just a statement here in the message law have having a shadow in bams in New York brother bam made this a statement he said Perfection he said God requires Perfection right no one could ever come to Heaven outside of being perfect you must be perfect and the scripture says None is perfect so if you must be perfect to come to heaven then and the scripture says None is perfect and we've all sent and come short of the glory of God how are we ever going to enter God's living place and Dwelling Place when he requires Perfection Jesus said I Believe In The Sermon on the Mount he said be therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect it goes on to say go goes on to say think of the Perfection that God requires of the person person a Perfection right right so it says stop take a look at it take account of it think of the Perfection now that God requires because there's going to be a lot of misunderstanding of perfection and there's going to be all different levels of perfection different ways of perfection and uh so we're just going to look at actually one of one of those ways uh and I'll explain more here as we get on here in just a little bit things that are to be in reality of California brother man said he's gone to prepare Place prepare place he at a perfect place right where no evil exists no sickness no old age exist no death exists it's a perfect place calling you to that Perfection and you have to be perfect to get there amen Jesus said so Bible say so Jesus said be therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect and it's a perfect Kingdom so it must be a perfect people come because you have to stand to be married to a perfect Son of God and you must be a perfect bride so we get from these and many more that God's requiring Perfection some sort of perfection whatever we would associate his Perfection or how we apply Perfection God would call it Perfection is that right that's right so it's from statements like this and and many others acts I begin to study the subject out and uh begin to present them from the pull pit uh just what it was as I was looking at it in the way of perfection that God requires of us as he did Abraham now twice in the two statements that I've just read brother Brandon refers back to the the New Testament scripture Jesus action that was in the sermon of the mount that's right in Matthew 5:48 uh when he said be you therefore perfect uh even as your father which is in heaven is perfect now there is a clue I believe in this scripture right that's revealed that lets us know that he's actually speaking to us here the elect in the end time because of a word that he uses here and the word for perfect there is teos and it literally means to be full grown it means to be adult it means to be a full age it means to be mature so be you therefore perfect no we're not so we're we're we're we're ruling out of perfection in the flesh cuz brother call it a carnal nature he said it'll always be sticky and whatnot so we're not talking about a perfection in the flesh all right so looking at the word that Jesus uses Tios which is which is which is an end time type word and it's used a number of times in the New Testament and this Perfection is basically just means maturity or full grown it's used again in Hebrews 5 and: 14 where the Apostle Paul said but strong meat belongs to them that are of full age right now back up to the previous verse he says verse 13 He that uses milk is unskillful in in the word of righteousness for he is a babe right well a babe drinks milk natur spiritual drinks milk but strong meat belongs to them that are perfect see so there there things now we can associate once we see this is the hour where in Perfection is required we'll see things that begin to connect together with it right so strong meat then belongs to let's say it like this us which are perfect are coming to this Perfection amen even those by who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil now the Apostle Paul you may remember in 1 Corinthians in Chapter 13 He talks uh which of course is the love chapter he continues on and he says we know in part we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect comes that which is part will be done away with no page 10:5 of the CLD Book 2 brother said we do have today with Divine Vindication that which is perfect has come all right so Paul goes on to say when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things and so Paul is actually taking the maturity of the church from its birth to its body change uh in paralleling it with his own self so when I was a child what does a child do he speaks like a child he thinks like a child he understands like a child right he's a baby he drinks milk and so forth and it said but now when we get to this place we're in Perfection you don't require Perfection of a baby do you you can't he's a human he's born but we realize there's a process a maturing process from childhood to adulthood are you with me all right so he says when I became a man then I put away childish s now right he goes on to say now we see through glass Darkly now but then face to face then when that which is perfect comes we see face to face we know it part and so forth but then I shall know even as I am also known so so he's prophesying a time then that the church will come to its birth to its mature position I like the statement in things that are to be brother mam said now you grew from your birth right when you was born and presented into this world God knew that you were going to be here in this earth and you grow it from birth to maturity talking about a natural man things that seem so strange to you in your young Womanhood young Boyhood as children now seems very real you couldn't understand it when you was a child but now as you become an adult you begin to understand and find out that everything was set just right he said it really means something to you now he says now so is it in your spiritual birth I'm not going to take time actually to begin to parallel these because I think that uh you certainly understand maybe the direction that I'm going amen there is a statement on page 363 I'd like to read in the church age book where brother mam said he talks about the false Vine group coming to fruition and he says that her fruit would mature and ripen he said that's correct he said but also now he said if the true uh if the false will mature he said then it must also be that the true bride church WIll mature all right that's right so this is what God's looking at he's not looking at babies in Christ he's looking for a mature uh full grown church is that right and he said her ripness her ripeness what are we laying in the presence of the son to do to ripen us right her ripness shall be an identification with her Lord by means of the word now words her maturity then will be an identification that God sees that God looks at uh as as an identification by means of the word in her head who will come to her M Gods which deed is Christ now what quickly becomes apparent to us is that in this verse and in the preceding verses which I'll get to here in just in just a bit is that we have instructions here Jesus gives us instructions to those who are placed adoption manifested son we're talking about placing Amen in other words you've come to your election and now Jesus requires us to be perfect amen this becomes a requirement right now when you consider the the the location of verse 48 the timing of this verse and the placement of this verse in its context with the previous 10 verses could perhaps jop that down and read it later and I'll read some of them in just a minute but it gives us I think a very different mindset or at least a different appreciation of what Jesus is referring to as Perfection but nevertheless that is the bottom line It's the final position for the bride be you therefore perfect is that right now I want you to understand here that Jesus is not necessarily talking about your doctrinal understanding here right he's not speaking about being under the blood and being identified with your sacrifice and being perfected in him which of course is true absolutely but that's not what he's talking about here he's talking about our Tios literally our human integrity and virtue that's present in full grown mature people exactly so he's talking about a character if you will he's talking about an attitude he's talking about a mature condition of my spirit that's right now I want to go to Hebrews 12 and read Paul's words concerning the Journey of the church in verse 22 he says but you now talking about the church are come to Mount Zion right and the City of the Living God the heavenly Jerusalem and unto an enumerable company of angels Amen to the general assembly and the Church of the firstborn which are written in heaven that's right and to God the judge of all I mean know he's coming is out God theud and to the spirits now watch the last thing he says and to the spirits of just men made perfect amen see to the spirits of just men made perfect now how many remembers in The Invisible Union of the Bride not only there but it works his faith Express in many of those sermons that he preached in that last little swing through the West Coast there but he begins to talk about true justification and explains it to us and he invest quite a bit of time in that talking about true justification right uh I'm reminded of a scripture in 1 Timothy 3:16 that says with controversy great is the mystery of godl God was manifest In the Flesh now watch justified in the spirit see of angels God was manifest In the Flesh now watch justified in the spirit so we're talking about a justification now in the spirit SST see of angels preach of the Gentiles believed on in the world received up into into Glory uh it was in Romans 8: 28-34 uh in Ephesians 1 1-5 he said all that he forew he did call and he called he justified all and all that he justified he's already glorified right brother actually quotes that it works as Faith expressed now the spirits of just men men that are Justified the spirits of these men made perfect now we're talking about AOS or be you therefore perfect even as your father which is Spirit In Heaven is perfect so there's the connection now that's right I want to get ahead of myself let me read to you the five verses that precede verse 48 Jesus says in verse 43 Matthew chap 5 you have heard word that it's been said Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy but I say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you do give them that hate you pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you am that you may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh his son to rise on the evil and the good sendeth rain on the just and the unjust so both groups now here get the benefit of the blessings of the message but there is an identifiable difference though or if you love them which love you what reward have you do not in the publicans the same if you salute your brethren only what more do you have than others do not the publicans also then be you therefore perfect so we have instructions here and these instructions in Matthew Chapter 5 are basic to understand how the spirit of a man the spirit of a woman who has been totally justified in the presence of God is in fact made perfect Glory say made perfect so it implies a process right right implies a process so what Jesus is presenting to us here is a word a behavior a conduct if you will a guideline amen that will serve as a gauge of the Perfection now that he requires of his people and it's going to be revealed by my response to and my treatment of my enemies and of those that persecute me and those that despitefully use me and they that hate me and they that curse me y right be therefore perfect even as your father or or literally in this respect right in this manner so Perfection now in this context he's dealing with a spirit now watch amen John 4:24 Jesus said God is a spirit so we then now he's talking about perfection in spirit even as our father who is spirit is perfect amen so he's telling me then Perfection will never be possible without the indwelling God who is Spirit otherwise all you have is a trained and refined human spirit and you'll be nothing but what brother called a mimic of Christianity in the Raptor he said there'll be millions and billions of them that will just be mimics of Christianity amen that's why David said in Psalm 51:10 he said create in me a clean heart oh God and renew a right Spirit within me so God can and in fact does not only create a clean heart but can renew and will renew a right spirit in me because that's dealing with this end time Perfection that it requires us that's right renew simply means repair or make a new right a right spirit is a restored spirit and establish a fixed a prepared so Jesus I believe is instructing us with regard to our spirit our attitude our Behavior if you will because we know that we in a placing process all right going from our true baptism to that mature position which is Hebrews 6:1 therefore leaving the principles is that what he said of the doctrine of Christ let us go on to Perfection okay of the doctrines of baptisms laying on of hands into the Resurrection the dead and eternal judgment and this will do if God permit but God didn't permit it there in that hour exactly so he says now but here's where we've got to leave something to go into something else the rudiments the fundamentals the foundational truths let nothing's wrong with the doctrine of baptisms and of Judgment of the dead and of faith in God and repentance from dead Works those things you want but once you preached once you come that way you don't want to hear a sermon on water baptism every Sund you got the baptism of Holy Ghost you don't want to hear a sermon service after service on the baptism of the Holy Ghost so you move from that the first principal of Christ and he said let's go into Perfection now this is an interesting word that the Apostle Paul uses uh and it's the only time that it's used in the New Testament and the word there the the better interpretation would be the perfector let us go on to the perfector and by definition it means the finisher so we're leaving the author of our faith and now going to the finisher of our faith see when you build a building you pour the foundation you put the walls up you dry it in and you don't come back and pour the foundation again and put the walls up you need a finish Carpenter to come in you need a turnkey crew to come in see you guys got a little little uh a little um uh you maybe you just have to do maybe just some touchup with the paintbrush or the or the sanding block or or uh you know with the hammer or whatever it's a finishing work now it's not an overhaul at this point and now it's just a finishing just a refinement if you will so he said leave the first principles and let's move on toward the perfector now and this what Paul was dealing with going from this to that to this to that all to the perfector which means the finisher or according to the D lot one who has in his own person raised Faith to its Perfection that would be perfect thing and so set before us the highest example of Faith now Paul perhaps would be talking about the Lord Jesus Christ have no problem with that but I believe that we've had one a forerunner that God has set in our midst to show us the highest example of faith come on a prophet of God so we're told now to go to this perfector now so the process here is this you come to the perfector and he'll raise your faith to its maturity right to its completion to his Perfection brother I'm talk about perfect Faith perfect faith and what is Faith he said he said faith is a revelation of the hour of the day the hour of the message and so forth so we come to the place of a perfect Revelation a perfect understanding all right that's what's here for us as I've often said if we've got the perfect interpretation of the word and that's come right then why wouldn't there be somebody here that could claim a perfect understanding of the perfect word next time now maybe we're not there now but I believe it would be in our you know our our near future that somebody's going to have an understanding of that per interpretation all right now so so the perfector will raise our faith to its maturity which will certainly expressed himself at least in part in the making perfect of the Justified believer Spirit right so there's something that begins to transpire in us from the baptism of the Holy Ghost like a baby forming in its mother's wound there's a growth right and as a and as a result of that growth I believe Jesus is telling us that there must be an identifiable Spirit or an attitude that will Express itself through you right and without question I believe that we should be able to identify this perfected spirit in our own lives and in the lives of others so what I'm saying is that at this time that Perfection is required of the Bride there should be an attitude or a spirit that our Revelation has created in us right that expresses itself right I'm saying to you tonight that our Revelation at this time we'll have created in us what Jesus is looking for because this is the identifiable result that we're looking for now in ourselves and others elect I'm talking about because it's what's God's looking for in US listen to the statement in stats of a perfect man on page 12 brother ra said what is it God condescending to his creation God wants to be worshiped the word god means I become worship now watch it's God trying to condition his people so he can get from them what he created them for he created us he created us to worship he created us for Fellowship he created us for communion amen he created us for dialogue he created us to express his own life his own character his own nature is that right he created us for these things he said God's trying to get from us tonight trying to get something from us that he created us for so it behoove us then to understand understand that God has has has invested um um um an investment in me cuz there's something in there that he wants out of me it's just like the child you got a little your child and you start he starts crawling and whatnot you he starts talking and babbling and whatnot the mother's going you you you you're putting something in that child you want to get something back out of it and you say Mama Mama Mama and Daddy's over there going Daddy Daddy Daddy he going say m first going to say Daddy first what are you expecting to get back out of that child right you're not wanting Newton's Second Law thermodynamics right you don't don't want some Einstein theory you don't want some homiletical exra jues you're looking for to get out of it what you put in it and what he's putting in US is what he what he wants preach to him and testified to him and spoken to him see what I'm saying only what he's and if it's not if he's not not first put it in us he won't accept it he won't accept it now that's right brother amen so Jesus spoke that that this Spirit now in the bride would would would come to this Perfection be made perfect when the church would come to its adoption right so I want us so what I want us to do just for a few minutes tonight is to Simply gauge ourselves compare ourselves and what we now possess to what was before prophesied would be here and in us right now there's no question this word this message this Revelation properly placed properly understood and properly approached will produce this corresponding quality of spirit that nobody else can display but bride Jesus is talking to bride see amen glory so you cannot at this time have Christ and not have this maturity or not be moving toward this maturity right this quality of spirit you remember what brother mam told us when he come back from Beyond the curtain of time he said nothing enters here but what perfect love mature love is that right right right in the message condolences to the stadle family he said and just then he said the angel talking about the angel talked when he's talking to over there said this is perfect love this is what you've taught yeah so an angel comes to the prophet of God say what you're experiencing over here in the sixth Dimension this is what you've taught this is perfect love right exactly beyond the curtain of time 1961 Jeff old brother said I more convinced now that ever in my life that would that that it will take perfect love to enter that place amen amen you don't go there to get perfect love you put it on here it matures here he said and there was no jealousy no tiredness no sickness no old age no death only Supreme Beauty and joy Hallelujah he said whatever you do lay aside everything else till you get that perfect love get to where you can love everybody even every enemy no matter if your plane is rocking the lightning is flashing or The Guns of the enemy are upon you these things do not matter get perfect love so these pressing issues and we've all got them in our lives always pressing issues those things that trouble us those besetting sins what you want to do you want to understand as the prophet of God said these things do not matter don't get distracted by these things he said get perfect love amen now Lord if I'm understanding this correctly that this living group must then without question display that matured love here on here before we get our before we get our body changed right now we know that that there will be an atmosphere then created and projected Among Us when that process now comes to its maturity that brother B felt and witnessed they went that beyond the curtain of time all right so that's got to be here then before we go there so think of it now he said there was no Envy no jealousy nobody mad at the next guy nobody with bitterness in their heart toward one another nobody with an attitude problem you didn't hear anybody say well I know more than you I saw this before you did I go to brother brother so and so's church was there no unresolved uh uh issues there no attitude problems no no no offenses there no secret centers just a constant flow of unfeigned unpretentious unconditional genuine mature Agape Love No Limits to it no walls No Boundaries on their love just pure as the driven snow this brother sister is perfect love this is the love of God that only the Bride Can display are you with me amen amen so they in this experience now that is in his translation the millions that he saw there they literally become the gauge of what we must be before we leave this human existence oh my come on all right because you don't go over there to get this perfect love to put it on here brother man said death doesn't change your nature right it only changes your what Your Dwelling Place see amen now I think it brother sister important understand this because brother bam taught us now that we've been returned to a restored Eden again in the spiritual sense that God's first family had right and and his last family also has righten true sunship he called it amen perfect communion and fellowship with God who would condescend to Adam his first family and Eve in the evening time to walk with him and talk with him he had access to the tree of life he had the authority he had the power he was a manifesting son here upon the Earth right right all right now that was the condition then watch what brother says in the breach on page 103 he said God's law require required a a kinsman redeemer that's right and the lamb come out boldly and said I'm their Kinsman I'm the Redeemer amen I now have made intercession for them and now I've come to claim their rights for them amen I've come to claim their rights in that they have a right to everything that was lost in the fall think that talking about talking to us right toally believer you have a right to everything they fell from you got a right to it now everything they lost in the fall he goes I've paid the price he said oh brother don't that make you feel religious that's right he goes on to say now but in this Sevenfold uh book of seals of redemption that the lamb took within himself was the only one who could do it amen and he took it from the right hand of him that sat upon the throne now to claim his Redemptive to claim his rights to claim for me and you what he redeemed us from right to right all right what he redeem us to know he redeemed us from what he redeemed us to back to everything that Adam Lost In the Garden of Eden he has redeemed us back to that which is what our inheritance he redeemed us back to that all right now watch he had already redeemed us back to that right see we've just now been renewed in that knowledge Paul in Colossians 3:10 he said he said in the new man the inward man he said is now renewed in that knowledge in the image of him exactly see renewed now in that knowledge cuz we know we were with him there but now we've been renewed in a knowledge now that we were privileged to to understand then we we're renewed in that knowledge not com to new knowledge but a knowledge that at some point in time Glory you see what I'm saying but what else did they have in Satan's Eden brother bam said page 19 he said they were Hol veiled right they were safe in God's pilion right they were alive right they had no death around them Hallelujah now watch they had perfect love one for the other perfect life forever they had perfect love perfect understanding of the love of God they had God's word and they kept it and they were alive and safe and God's eaten with no death around at all right that's right so you see why it's crucial for us tonight brother sister that we have a good understanding or a complete understanding or a perfect understanding as Adam and Eve did of perfect love amen see so what what may be the real lesson in Matthew 5:43 that Jesus is W wanting us to see is the mystery of perfect love right could be the real lesson there regardless right I'm telling you brother and sister if we can view every man equally now under this anointing right then we're beginning to come into an alignment with what they functioned under over on the other side right because let me say it again hear me they are our gauge of what we are ordained to and must become right all right recognizing your day death doesn't do nothing to a man but change his Dwelling Place doesn't change your nature doesn't change your faith doesn't change nothing in you but your dwelling place so which way your nature is this morning right right I'm talking about something that's that's here today and gone tomorrow not something that's controlled by circumstances and events uh that changes with emotional variations not something that vacillates with the total in your checkbook or the weather outside but something that's real something that's enduring and it's lasting something that's lived out automatically as fruit that grows from a branch do you follow me amen I'm not talking about intellectual procedure how much you know or don't know is I am that true quality of spirit that no doubt many in the M might have just missed oh my this is what perfect Faith perfect love will produced right brother bman the message Abraham restored Long Beach 1961 he said he's got to have a church that to uh to make that Capstone come on it's got to come on there perfect right and the church has got to draw into Perfection you say perfection that's what he said referring back to Jesus in Matthew 5:43 be you perfect as my Father in Heaven is perfect so again again is quoting Matthew 5:43 and again the word there is tellios or wholesome or unimpaired or innocent having Integrity amen one definition said what is completely and entirely in accord with truth and fact I like that definition right so this is the condition getting back to Genesis 17 this is the condition that Abraham was required to be in prior to his body changed exactly Jesus and Paul in the New Testament essentially say the same thing with respect to the condition of the Bride in this hour y so when Jesus tells us to be therefore perfect he is in effect giving us his own description of the church at Rapture time right let me say it again he's giving us his own description of the church the elected blood watch church at Rapture time all right perfect Faith Amen brother Adam said in august 19 63 he said so when a man lives by faith walks by faith I mean substance Faith right he's isolated from the entire world becomes a new creature in Christ now you're getting into bride material you're getting into rapturing condition now that means each one of us I just a pastor Deacon trust these that means for the Le every individual walks in a world with God Alone you're baptized into his kingdom there's nobody in there but you and God see he gives the orders you pack them out y whatever he says there's not a Shadow of Doubt nowhere you right is he is he describing you here that's right Ian he's describe us here I believe we all say yep yep that's me that's me that's me looking in the perfect law of Liberty reflecting back amen the very image of the word very thing he's talking that's rapt and condition walking alone with God he gives you orders you pack them out yes Lord yes Lord yes Lord thank you Lord he says now there's not a doubt nowhere if the Lord says this nobody in the world can talk you out of it right nobody in the world can talk you out of you just go right on justce a you're coming into perfect Faith perfect Perfection that cannot fail that faith never fails amen yeah he was a Mystic to them with his perfect faith and so is it now with those who have perfect Faith are a Mystic to others right right so the thought implied here in Matthew 5:48 is be full grown be mature men right be men of consumate and women men and women of consumate human integrity and virtue amen you know what that means it means to be skillful it means to be accomplished the dictionary defines Integrity as the quality of always behaving according to the moral principles that you believe in right so that people respect and trust you glory virtue simply speaks of the quality of being morally good or righteous right now let me drop this in before we before I continue on when the bride matures to this condition of perfection that Jesus is talking about according to Hebrews 5:14 the strong mean of the word mentioned it earlier belongs to her and at that time she begins to exercise her discernment to know good from Evil righteousness from wickedness right now now listen don't ever underestimate how thankful we should be in this hour to have this type of discernment because we're told by prophet in that many in this day will call evil good and good evil right Isaiah 5: 20 right what are them that call evil good and good evil that put light for darkness and darkness for light that put bitter for sweet and Sweet for bitter so there's a prophecy now that that uh that uh Finds Its way down to the last day amen so it's we want to call good good and evil evil brother bam said in God in Simplicity page 17 he said you know what man calls great sometimes is not great what God calls great man calls foolish what God calls foolish man calls great so let's bear that in mind and let's weigh every every word I'm telling you if we didn't have this discernment I'm tell you where we'd be tonight tell you where we'd be where what we'd be believing what we'd be looking at brother Benin God being misunderstood he says you don't want a wrong Spirit you want the right Spirit impersonation of Christianity Jeff he said and create in US Lord creating us the right kind of spirit to let the Holy Spirit control us and lead us and guide us as we journey on in the Mage enticing Spirits Jeff 55 he said created me a clean Spirit see what God will do God will do it this morning amen see where he's directing that talking about a clean Spirit a right Spirit a clean Spirit seed is not a with the sh jel 65 and Lord created me a good spirit now I read these statements to show that God does in fact deal with our human spirit in a spiritual way right because my human Spirit can be a right Spirit or a wrong Spirit right again he said God being misunderstood you don't want a wrong Spirit you want the right spirit so I want you to understand and recognize that we're now living in a process right wherein Jesus Christ is perfecting our Justified Spirit on through our troubles and our trials and our adversity and the persecutions and such see as it's maturing us to this perfect love are you still with me right amen now Jesus teaching in Matthew 5 is unquestionably anchored and rooted in the principle of love right and it's here that he introduces a new attitude a new response that he wants to see in his people yeah it's no longer evil for evil right it's no longer persecution for persecution no longer you did this to me I'm going to do that to you right right he begins verse 43 by saying you have heard it's been said it's been taught was written but now Jesus says under grace I'm going to bring another attitude I'm going to bring another disposition to you amen all right so he says now I say in other words there got to be something different come now yeah and going to be a different response there's going to be a different understanding of God the character of God the nature of God there's going to be another reaction you're going to display when you're inured right is no longer going to be rendered evil for evil but rather good for evil right Paul would later write to the Romans 12:4 bless them that persecute you bless and curse not verse 17 recompense to no man evil for evil provide things honest in the sight of all men verse 21 be not overcome of evil but overcome evil with good right now this is a tough one for the flesh man brother sister but if we can remember brother bam said he he said listen that a Christian will always give you the benefit of the doubt exactly a lot of misunderstandings a lot of troubles can be avoided if we just remember to give that brother give that sister even down to your enemy give them the benefit of the doubt amen right so we said a Christian will always do that so that's what we're going to do right to our brother our sister our adversary even our enemy amen whoever he might be when there's a misunderstanding when there's a dispute of some sort right right so what now what now begins to surface and come into Focus for us is the truth that we've got to consciously and deliberately deal with our own spirit and attitude now and I'll say it again this is a manifestation of our placing this is all part of the maturing that the Bride Comes to right it all comes down now to personal confrontations right I'm not talking about confronting one or another there's a time for that but I'm talking about confronting our own issues right our own problems right see because eventually before we leave this human existence we'll all have to personally confront every area of our lives under this glorious Morning Light that's come to us in the end time and understand nobody is exempt from it right amen is see my conduct in my home my conduct on the job my conduct with friends and families and even in the presence of my enemies amen I'll have to confront my relationship with God my prayer life my study time see what I mean right means that we feel more comfortable ignoring or sweeping aside even down to our fears and phobias and such we have to come to a personal confrontation with ourselves and this is exactly what Paul taught us to do in second Corinthians 13 and verse 5 he said examine yourself whether you be in the faith right exactly he said prove your own selves right The Net Bible says prove yourselves I'm sorry put yourself to the test to see if in the faith right the new Amplified Standard Bible says test yourself to see if you're in the faith examine yourself or do you not recognize this about yourself that Jesus Christ is in you unless indeed you fail the test right the message version says test yourself to make sure you're solid in the faith Don't Drift along taking everything for granted give yourselves regular checkups you need firsthand evidence not near hears s that Jesus Christ is in you test it out if you fail the test do something about it and this is exactly the point that I've been stressing to you for the last 45 minutes testing ourselves confronting ourselves with our newly growing newly developing character amen see how is my attitude now toward my enemy toward my brother toward my family toward the believer toward the unbeliever how's my attitude toward the message how's my attitude toward life right I when things go our way when things don't go our way do we pout do we fuss Do We complain do we grip we score on that test brother sister right do we pass that test or do we adopt the attitude of the Prophet to where he said in flashing red light the sign of his coming he said oh God he says I he says give me Grace never to complain he said I know that someday I've got to die I hope God never lets Satan Crown me as an old crabbed in different man with my wife an old nagging woman and or your wife or you that way right amen I pray brother that our lives will be crowed with the fruits of the spirit love joy suffering gentl patience truth faith in the holy spirit amen God give me Grace never to complain that's an easy quote to remember if you don't remember nothing else I said tonight you will remember that and your pastor will probably remind you of that from time to time that's right manifested Sons brother said the thing I want to try to get to you is this that a man that is in Christ with the Holy Ghost can bear with a man when he's wrong longsuffering gentle patient he's sweet humble faithful filled with the spirit never negative always positive he's a different person right boy it's getting tough now a it God give me Grace never to complain give me Grace never to be negative always to be positive Lord that's where we want to start right there he said he's a different person amen and we are different people we are different right but how do we know unless we examine ourselves and put ourselves to the test to see if we're in the faith in the good times in the bad times when you got money when you got bills laid on the table and you don't know how you're going to pay them right see testing our attitudes toward one another our every word that we speak our thoughts toward toward toward an issue our motives our Ambitions our goals our desires as well as our reaction to injury most importantly our own spirit amen because as I've said our spirit if our spirit is Right everything else is going to fall into place right that's it amen even that's the spirit of truth brother B says no matter how little it is or how great it is it's just the same in the sight of God always the same to act right in the place where you're at right always it's a great thing to follow the Lord amen no matter where you're at in this 24-hour day that God gives you every day listen he said just act right do right act right be right think right he said you're bound to come out right that was his little M you know he talk talked about act right he said no no God doesn't look at as a big thing or a little thing we kind of gauge our trials that's a big trial that's a little trial oh I get through that I don't need God's help I don't need to pray about that you do need to no matter how great how little it's all the same in the sight of God just act right where you're at all great things right am so what am I saying we got to confront ourselves right we got to prove ourselves why so we'll know that we are absolutely in the faith listen brother and sisters and not just uttering some vain confession about who we are and what we've got right right exactly you say well I believe the message I go to church I pay my tithes and offerings I believe in one God isn't that enough not for the bride it's not James 2:19 thou Believers there's one God th do as well the devil's also believe and tremble right listen to what your Prophet said in the message once faith wants delivered to the saint he said if all you have to do is believe that God is and you kneel down and worship him then Cain was justified right the Bible said that even the devil believes it to be the truth and the devil publicly confessed that Jesus to be the Son of God he said I didn't save him he said brother we better get straight down right got to be a mistake one of the days somebody's right and somebody's wrong you better take what the Bible said you got to be born again not mystical think you're born again but when the spirit absolutely kills everything in the world in you you regenerated a new creature in Christ you know the old things has passed away if you still love the world the things of the world the Bible said the love of God is not even in you he said amen he said that was plain brother he said but it's not whitewashed he said it'll wash you white exactly examining ourselves confronting ourselves right you remember in the message running from the presence of the Lord I think which was might have been the first message that he preached in that series of February 1965 when he when he preached uh who is this mzc marriage and divorce and so forth he started off by preaching running from the presence of the Lord and you know how the first I don't know 8 10 pages brother B him saying how man is always prone to run from responsibilities right he said whether you're a housewife or farmer factory worker whatever it is he said you owe he said you owe it to God to give your best to that man you're working for not as men Pleasers see but as but as but as Servants of the Living God he said ministers he said run from the responsibility of taking this message amen and rolling up their sleeves and preaching the truth whether it will cut or Rend or tear whatever shut the he of it makes no difference it's the truth brother amen and it'll get you to where you want to go amen that's right so he says he tell how we running from responsibility and he spent a quite a bit of time telling us that we've got to confront our responsibilities he said because we've got to be accountable to God and also he said now not only that but we've got to be accountable to one another that's right man see I probably spent you we when I started the series probably spent several weeks just looking at jesus' teachings on accountability and our requirement to keep a clean sleep right uh before God and and towards all men always having forgiveness in our hearts for not only the Saints but our enemies as well amen those in the camp and those outside the camp right what happens if we don't what happens if we don't let me read it to you right Jesus in Matthew 5:23 he said therefore if you bring your gift to The Altar and remember that your brother has ought against you leave there thy gift before the altar go thy way first be reconciled with the brother and then come and offer thy gift agree with thine adversary quickly while Thou Art in the way with him lest in any time the adversary deliver you to the judge and the judge deliver you to the officer and you be cast into prison right verily I say thou shalt by no means come out th till thou H has paid the uttermost fary rightly and that's about 13 of a penny in Matthew uh Matthew 18:34 Jesus Is Telling another uh story about a man who was forgiven much and he turned around and held another man liable for some smaller dep and when the when the when the servant the master heard of it he was wough 18:34 and delivered him to the tormentors till he should pay all that was due him so likewise so likewise shall my heavenly father do also unto you that's right if you from your hearts will not forgive everyone his brother their trespasses he ensures that you will in no way in no wise Harbor resentment ill will offenses or whatnot towards your brother Jesus said I will not let that happen not from home that's right so if we have ought with our brother or our sister or even our enemy Jesus says you leave your gift at the altar and make that thing right I won't even receive your gift I want even receive wor don't even bother praying to me amen and he said if we don't do it he says we're turned over to the judge the adversary now the adversary turns you the offended party turns you over to the judge the judge turns you over to the Jailer which is a nice way to say Tormentor yeah right which he uses the word Tormentor it's only used one time you know what you know what the Tormentor is here here here's what here's what the uh the dolot says one who elicits the truth by the use of the rack right I don't think we use them they might use them down in guantan I'm not sure you hear a lot of funny things com out we don't know what to use water board R Who car whatever right but Jesus says he's and he's very demonstrative he's very he's very uh he's very colorful here when he says he says look you're going to deliver you to the torment it's one who elicits Truth by use of the rack you know you know Medieval Times you know n us there you know put you on the r and they tie you down they start going click click click click click click I don't know about you but I'm confessing name rank serial number whatever else you want to know I'm giving up oh oh my God how manyan ever been on the rack I've been on the rack before it don't feel good either and I never got no toer either I'm still 5'8 one who elicits Truth by the use of the rack right an Inquisitor a torturer also used of a Jailer doubtless because the business of torturing was also a to him and Jesus says I will turn you over to him oh my if you want to hold forgive you think it's you think it's you know just a little thing it's not a big thing you think it'll just go away you think God will just bypass look at no no no no no no he said you don't get rid of that thing get that thing out of your heart I'm going to turn you right over to the jail of the Tormentor and you're going right to the rack right am see so he sends us to a debtor's prison he puts us on the rack and he says you're going to stay there until a righteous recompense comes forth from your lips oh my come on think about that amen amen verely I say to you thou shall no means come out F until youve paid the utter uttermost far than 38 of the sin right so we' got to here now confront our willingness to keep the Sleep clean in other words our accountability to one another right because we have the responsibility to love our enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you pray for them to despitefully use you and persecute you that what that you may be the children of your father which is in heaven amen right it's an expression of sun right so everything comes under examination in this hour amen I'm not going to expound on it but 1 Corinthians 3:13 now watch this every man's work shall be made manifest for the day exactly the day of the Lord this this is the day the Lord has made the day shall declare it because it shall be revealed by fire the return of the pillar of fire amen amen and the fire shall try every Every Man's work what sort it is that's right amen it all boils down to this love this this Capstone this perfect love love your neighbor love one another love your enemy love love love that's the whole theme of the New Testament is it amen that's right you remember John the Apostle John he's he goes out he's exiled to the a of patmas he spends two and a half years out two years out there I think it was sees this great vision of the end time he sees the rise of the Antichrist he sees the uh he sees the seals he hears the Thunders utter he sees the uh the tribulation period he sees the wrath of God poured out he sees all of these various things and John now when he comes back to his church that's I think around 90 92 years old he pastors the Ephesian church I think for two years and he says in the third verse or third chapter 11th verse of First John he said this is the message you've heard from the beginning that we should love one another it was the message in the beginning it's the message in the end love one another right so it's all about love and this love only comes by first conversion and then a maturing process amen the whole new testament is built around the principle of love and that's why brother man said love is the greatest power the greatest forth it overcomes everything what does love amen in a message Called Love in stre 456 he said I think love is the greatest Force there is in the world there's nothing more powerful than love Jesus Christ the same in Charlotte 56 he says love will do just just do things that nothing else will do God projecting his love Edmund and Alberta he said love is the greatest force that ever was put in the power of man what is yeah what is some radio control missile device some hang grenade some some some uh machine gun no it said love is the greatest power that's put into the possession of man amen he said in the message God commissioning Moses the prophet in Jonesburg Arkansas he said I find this at the greatest power in the world is not the atomic bomb right but a believer in contact with his Mak it changes the whole attitude changes his mental changes his habit changes his body changes his nature everything he says then how could dot dot dot right that's right in all of this the prophet is saying that in adoption at maturity it will produce this quality this principle of love that is more powerful than indebtedness more powerful than injury more powerful than offense more powerful than disease and bitterness Jesus is telling us in Matthew 5 that when we come to the place where we begin to express this love as he's laid out here it will prove that we are children of our father amen right so when we begin to to to reflect or display this Divine love it will be brother sister a proof or let me say it like this and an identifiable evidence that you reene seed of God that's been matured and placed because remember brother Christ revealed his own word said there's nothing ever been like it or will be Hereafter the thing that's the matter with the message to they those who obtain it their hearts must lay in the presence of the sun to get ripen you pick up the message and then let the son of the sun bake all the greenness out of you make you matured Christians right you see what I mean coming soon him to receive his church we must have that type of Christian what type the perfect type the mature type for him to receive the wheat's got to get rip right amen so the ripening the ripening is what it's the end result of our placing and that is the displaying of this perfect Spirit which is a right reaction to personal injuries from our brothers and our sisters in the camp as well as our enemies and adversaries outside or beyond the C that's right so as we begin to examine ourselves under this end time light you can see this or be be aware of this transforming process that's taking you that's taking you from brotherly love to this Divine love that encompasses every man and woman friend or fool right because it reacts to injury right it reacts to offenses right right exactly so when Jesus tells us to be therefore perfect it's not only a call to material but he's telling us that love is a basic quality of sunship not just a FAL love but a mature adoption love a Capstone love a Divine love on display right a love that reveals the true disciple right Jesus is the one that said in John 13:34 a new commandment I give you that you love one another as I've loved you see that you love one another by this shall all men know that you are my disciples if you have right amen love one to another thank you Lord hallelujah so As We Lay in the presence lay in his presence glory and we view it in the mirror of his word as we eat from the Tree of Life what's it doing it's maturing our attitudes and our responses and our reactions in regard to every man especially our enemies it will develop in us a responsibility that God requires of us to be men to be adult to be grown up to be full age answer the call to the responsibilities of Jes amen so true love is going to be what it's going to be a mark of maturity right and if there's no maturity of true love then the very purpose of the indwelling Christ is missed right right so As We Lay in the presence as we eat from the Tree of Life from this restored Eden right it'll mature our attitudes in regard to others whether they be friends or f as we said that's right I'm winding down here but let me let let me say this this is this this is the love that's created or comes to to its fruition at Harvest Time among the True Believers and again if we only love the brothers that proves that we're born again Jesus said if you don't what what what than can it only proves we're born again but we're talking about being placed now right talking about perfection talking about maturity now right this is the time brother and sister where we where we approach God and man with a true revelation of Grace in our heart right see and it's displayed it's displayed in our reaction to others right see how else do we express Express the revelation of Grace if it's not if it's not to other people see how can you love God whom you haven't seen right when we can't love your brother whom you have seen right how can you pay your debt to God when you won't forgive your brother won't forgive your enemy right ain't going to happen in the message where I think Pentecost fail San Bernardino 1955 brother man says and if you can't love your brother who you've seen how can you love God who you haven't seen and brother when love go goes out God goes with it did he tell us something like this when love projects what happens when love projects Grace takes over that's right amen yes sir love projected one day when he's walking through a walking through a bull's field is it walking through some field and a Bull jump up love projected what happened right he Liv to tell about it BR took over same with the Hornets or the yellow jackets or whatever it was what he just projected love oh I'm sorry little guys I didn't mean to didn't mean to invade your little your your little place here and what happened he left to tell about he didn't get stung to death Grace took over Love Project projecting love perfect love see he said brother when love goes out God goes with it for God is love right and you can never get anywhere without Divine love as long as you love your one another you love God that's right so this is God's way this is God's plan see we got to got to start looking at things at some point in time from from his perspective right as you're dealing with your brother you're dealing with God Amen because you can't live in disor pray with your brother or your sister and expect the channel of blessing with God to be open so there's a Divine love there's an atmosphere that accommodates or accompanies this placing of sons that must be displayed in the adoption season amen and that's where we are Amen in other words adoption calls for this Divine love to be here and expressed through Sons and Daughters of God exactly 1 Peter 1:22 seeing you have purified your souls and obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the Brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently right you know what unfeigned means unfeigned love it means without hypocrisy right right it means without disguise it means sincere it means genuine right so Peter says a genuine experience a genuine growth a genuine maturity will produce This Love Without hypocrisy right brother see hey brother how you doing sure love your brother sure appreciate your brother and then get you guard right home and just tear him down that's pretentious love that's hypocritical love that's not this unsane love so he says this true genuine unan love will produce will will will just Will Will just Vanquish hypocrisy right he said this love will supersede any other love the love of family friends neighbors material possession homes cars whatever it will supersede all of that right amen what I'm saying is this in closing we cannot have a correct love for the word of God the message of the hour without having a corresponding genuine love for the body of Christ I don't care where this body is or what they've done this new birth will respond by creating an atmosphere of love and will promote a correct response to each other it'll absolutely produce that that's right Jesus said in essence he said listen you'll always be well-minded toward the church right the brothers and sisters the officers the ministers and let me point out that Jesus said in Matthew 10:36 that our foes our enemies would be they of our own household that right your enemies will be they of your own household now that's both natural and spiritual where did Jesus get his wounds at right in the house of work House of his friends I don't know about you brother Dale but all the the wounds that I've got on me I mean I I a lot of spiritual wounds you going to see phys but they come from the house of my friends the Ministries that we've had in the assembly and this that and the other and whatnot you know they get the knife in the back and they turn it real good my biggest challenges my biggest difficulties that I've had and so forth the biggest trials have been from other people in the in the church just that way and Jesus promised that Jesus said that it would be Zechariah 13:6 and one shall say what are these wounds in mine hands and he shall answer those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends in the house of his friends not the drunkards not the drug pushers not the derel and the zealots of his day but in the household of faith those who claim to be in the m the truth be moan brother sister that's where we're going to get most of ours as well right our struggles our fights our our disagreements our contentions our debates our disputes where right in the message Community right amen we need to know that we need to remember that because you know what that's where the judases are that's where aen is that's where Janice and jambre are that's where Honus and felus are those are the two blasphemers that Paul had to deliver over to Satan concerning faith and good conscience had made shipwreck right when Paul wrote to Timothy of them he said in 2 Timothy 21718 their word do eat as a canker of whom H is and fitus who concerning the faith have have aired saying the resurrection pass over the face of that's where hus and fitus are or felis Hermes and Fel remember them right they were two they were the two men that got their own Revelation apart from Paul and they left the Apostle Paul right that's where Alexander the copper Smith is in the household of faith right who did Paul much evil that's where Deus is right that's another one who left the prophet Paul's message that's where doctr fees is in the household of faith see he's the one who love to have preeminence among the Brethren remember John writing of him in third John verse n right how many knows we got some Sons ofct fees read dismiss huh sure we do right these are the type of men who esteem themselves to be a little bit higher a little bit deeper a little bit better a little more in tune with the spirit than the average preacher and granted maybe in some areas they are I won't deny that but the point is the but but the point is that arrogant self-righteous self-promoting Spirit should never be on display and ped off as a Christlike Spirit exactly amen that's right Dr Gil the Bible Expositor made this observation he said does means nourished by Jo is a Christian mentioned in third John 9 he was a gentile there was one of his name who was of the king of Athens that may confirm this the sliding and rejecting Brethren that came from Judea is very likely he was more than a private member of the church that he was an officer and it may be that he was the pastor and though there is a preeminence which of right belongs to such an officer as to provide over the church to govern guide direct according to the laws of Christ he being set over the church as a ruler governor and God yet this man may be carried too far as it was by this man who coveted more than his due and lorded over God's Heritage ruled the flock with force and cruelty and assert a tyrannical power over them we got these guys in the message I just had to veto about six names I it's here it's here and that's the type of spirit we contend with in the message church today as well given how Despicable and disgraceful these pretentious message pastors are that we have come that we have come to our placing still must love our enemies amen amen if they war against us and fight against us and do all man of evil against us y huh as they did to Paul and brother randam and we say that's my enemy he's off the word that we're obligated to pray for for unless he's blasphemed and he probably already has but we must love him anyhow am we do not have the right to fight back and you know well the judge is here and he's in me and act all cocky and rude and belligerent not at all the judge is here that's true but he's but he's here to examine your spirit right right the spirit of the Bride because she's the one who's going to be ruling and judging in the not these other birds right right see what makes them enemies is their hatred to release their attitude toward the true bride not our hatred toward them because our treat of others is not predicated on how they treat us right in other words you treat me NE me I'm going to treat you me you yell at me I'm going to yell back at you you tell a lie on me and I'm going to tell a lie back on you uh not at all right our treatment of others is not predicated on how they treat us exct right see that none render Paul writes to the Thessalonians that either evil for evil but ever follow that which is good among yourselves and to all men right amen amen see as the musicians come I just keep going and going the musicians may come what we got to do is keep in mind this is a m battle this is the greatest battle ever fought it's a spiritual warfare we're we're involved in right and the weapons of our Warfare are what are not carnal But Mighty through God pulling down the strongholds that's right so that true bride Spirit brother sister makes us conscious then to love everybody and causes us to get along with everybody and live at peace with everybody as much as lies within us that's right huh is that what he said if it be possible as much as lie within you possible why because we're everyone's enemy outside of just if few listen the whole world hated Jesus didn't he that's right and Jesus said in John 1518 if the world hate you and you know it hated me before it hated you yeah hey see that's the Paradox we we're we're a threat to nobody right but yet others are threaten threatened by us you say why because of our lives our existence our present what we stand for what we believe Jesus warned it would be this way right he absolutely did so hatred and persecution are two things that we're told we're going to get whether we like it or not so we got to get it in our minds and that's what this message invites that's what it brings to us this message invites hatred and mistreatment and persecution and we know the great persecution is actually just ahead of so make a little bit on that on Sunday but you just remember he said we're just Mystics that's right Mystic people ain't going to understand you uhuh that's right see misunderstanding something we know a lot about if you've been in the message more than two days you know what misunderstandings all about H that's exactly what a Mystic means it means mysterious or difficult to understand but it also means having a Divine meaning that is beyond human understanding amen glory to God it means having a supernatural or spiritual significance of power he was a Mystic to them with his perfect faith it ain't going to be no difference than us is God is maturing and developing growing into this full maturity Perfection brother sister with this Faith it's going to be like brother B said he was a Mystic to them with his perfect faith and so it is now with those who have perfect faith that's we are Mystic to others that's right so we have in Jesus an example of what life of a Mystic really is right so as Mystics they not going to understand you they won't be able to figure you out right they won't be able to Fathom what we believe or what we stand for right see the the fact of the matter is is just our very presence what we stand for is a threat to their way of life and their beliefs and their legalism and their their Pentecostal ways but listen brother said we're just mere sheep we're just sheep grazing in the pasture meat sheep gentle sheep defens little sheep the Sheep amen we've just surrendered our wool to him you know he said what's your wool he said it's your rights a lamb is willing to submit its rights amen but this is what God has called us to I'm glad to be a part of Amen overcoming power in The Bu of the Bri brother will come over overcome every time I don't

give our Perfection Perfection it comes through Jesus Christ like he said the prophet said God required it he'd have to make a way that's right said he did he came himself to make a way think about perfection right we used to wonder what the word meant argue over well and you think you're perfect you know people say even stickers on the car said I'm not perfect I'm just forgiven and they don't realize if you're forgiven that makes you perfect because there's nothing against 539 anybody have anybody have a name you heard the message you believe the word but if you need it come for and we lay
