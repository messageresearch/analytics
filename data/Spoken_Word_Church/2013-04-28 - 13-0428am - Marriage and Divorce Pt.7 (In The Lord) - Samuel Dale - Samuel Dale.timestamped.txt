[3:05] healed us and delivered us from
[3:07] destruction and just have your way now
[3:09] keep us and guide us in Jesus name
[3:13] amen Matthew
[3:19] 19 begin verse
[3:22] three the Pharisees came unto him
[3:24] tempting him and saying unto him is it
[3:27] lawful for a man to put away his wife
[3:29] forever cause and he answered and said
[3:32] unto them have you not read that he
[3:34] which made them at the beginning made
[3:36] them male and female and said for this
[3:38] cause shall a man leave leave father and
[3:42] mother and shall cleave to his wife and
[3:44] they twain shall be one flesh wherefore
[3:47] there are no more twine but one flesh
[3:49] what therefore God hath joined together
[3:52] let not man put a su they say unto him
[3:55] why did Moses then command to give a
[3:58] writing of divorcement and to put her
[4:00] away he saith unto them Moses because of
[4:03] the hardness of your hearts suffered you
[4:05] to put away your wives but from the
[4:07] beginning it was not so and I say unto
[4:10] you whosoever shall put away his wife
[4:13] except it be for fornication and shall
[4:15] marry another committeth adultery and
[4:17] who so Marth her that is put away does
[4:20] commit adultery you may be seated the
[4:23] Lord add his Blessing to the reading of
[4:26] the
[4:27] word now what what I want to do today is
[4:31] this
[4:32] morning is to just kind
[4:35] of uh review some things and uh go over
[4:39] it to for you to understand where I
[4:42] stand and what's you know my stand and
[4:45] why I take it I try to uh place it in
[4:49] the scripture I try to do the best that
[4:51] I can and I know according to most
[4:55] people uh they don't agree with me
[4:58] probably the way that that I believe on
[5:00] marriage and divorce but I believe it's
[5:01] scriptural I believe I can prove it and
[5:04] I've never had to uh change it from the
[5:08] beginning because I've done this over 40
[5:10] something years and I've done it many
[5:13] times to bring series you know on like
[5:16] marriage and divorce and things to try
[5:18] to to get a little little better
[5:21] understanding and and all and especially
[5:23] for the younger ones coming along and
[5:25] all of that but I just want to kind of
[5:28] review some thoughts that we've been
[5:30] doing and maybe not as much reading this
[5:33] morning but just think on the things
[5:36] that we've tried to
[5:37] cover now the prophet said anytime that
[5:40] you speaking on any religious matters uh
[5:44] this the part of marriage and divorce
[5:46] will come up and when it comes up then
[5:50] it will you know will stir the people
[5:52] and they'll begin to ask questions and
[5:55] that's what happened there with with the
[5:57] Lord Jesus and they asked him a question
[5:59] there about it you know can a man put
[6:01] his wife away for every cause well he
[6:04] immediately answered it wasn't so from
[6:07] the beginning right and that was his
[6:09] answer it wasn't that he was you know
[6:11] playing around with them he was telling
[6:13] them this wasn't right to begin with you
[6:15] know what's wound up in trouble and all
[6:17] it was not right to start with but said
[6:20] now they said but why did Moses then
[6:22] give us a writing a divorcement he said
[6:25] because of the hardness of your heart he
[6:27] done that now we went back and went
[6:29] through through
[6:30] that trying to cover that that Moses
[6:34] just didn't give a right to divorce your
[6:36] wife for any reason you got to have a
[6:39] scriptural reason if you're going to
[6:42] divorce you know a man to divorce his
[6:44] wife and to to and then to
[6:47] remarry but we found that the woman has
[6:50] no right whatsoever because of the
[6:53] scriptural stand that was taken and all
[6:56] and and she has no right because Romans
[6:58] tell says it's her husband has to be
[7:01] dead there's no grounds for her
[7:04] whatsoever to divorce and remarry
[7:07] because it it's because of her being the
[7:09] fall in the beginning she was the one
[7:12] that caused it you said no Eve caused it
[7:15] and we didn't have anything to do with
[7:16] it well that's the part that's placed
[7:19] upon us today that because of the Fall
[7:23] we're in the condition we're in all
[7:25] right then in trying to just be plain
[7:28] and stand on it I I believe that you
[7:31] know if we would have prayed a whole lot
[7:34] uh we wouldn't have had as much trouble
[7:35] about our marital situations if we' have
[7:39] done a lot of praying done a lot of
[7:40] seeking the Lord you know instead of
[7:42] just our own lustful thoughts and ideas
[7:46] and and going forth it would have been
[7:48] different but yet we didn't do that so
[7:51] we're in bad shape you know life is and
[7:54] and then we we've tried to go through uh
[7:56] the things of what happened and we know
[7:59] and have covered what happened in the
[8:02] garden we know that Adam was first told
[8:07] himself while Eve was still in Adam to
[8:10] not partake of the tree of knowledge of
[8:13] Good and Evil there is no actual
[8:14] statement to Eve to not do that cuz she
[8:17] was in Adam at the time and you know
[8:20] that was supposed to have taken care of
[8:22] it but we know that what she done she
[8:25] did partake of that tree of knowledge of
[8:28] Good and Evil now that's a funny tree
[8:29] they tried to make it an apple tree A P
[8:32] tree or something you know and all and
[8:35] in doing it they they've come up with
[8:38] all kind of ideas but see we know what
[8:41] happened in the garden the Bible says
[8:43] that Eve said the serpent beguiled me he
[8:48] defiled me well now you take a Playboy
[8:51] magazine and I just make it blunt you
[8:53] get a Playboy magazine and you look at
[8:56] it and bless God I ain't going to read
[8:57] one well that's all all right I'm not
[9:00] I'm just being my what I am but you can
[9:02] take a Playboy magazine and read it and
[9:04] it'll tell you all of what happened in
[9:06] the Garden of Eden yeah but you talk to
[9:09] the preachers and they don't know
[9:10] anything what happened it was eating an
[9:11] apple well why did it wind up with all
[9:14] of us in problems why would Eve cursed
[9:16] about the you know the point of making
[9:18] it be in trouble with childbearing if it
[9:20] was eatting an
[9:21] apple now you order to get the apples
[9:23] and passie them out because your
[9:26] antidote has to come from the thing that
[9:28] you're dealing with with so then we were
[9:30] to get apples and pice them out but no
[9:33] anybody with any sense as I saying about
[9:35] to playm More Magazine you can read that
[9:37] and they can tell you what happened but
[9:39] preachers are so spiritual until they
[9:43] you know no no that's that's wrong thing
[9:46] well what happened why did Jesus have to
[9:49] come through the wound of a
[9:51] virgin why couldn't he come through the
[9:53] wound of just any woman why he have to
[9:56] come through the wound of a virgin and
[9:57] why didn't he come off an apple tree
[10:03] you know I mean is that sensible why
[10:06] didn't he just fall off apple tree right
[10:08] maybe he was a granny smith you know
[10:10] they're kind of bitter or a crab apple
[10:14] but we ought to know as human Mortals
[10:17] what took place in the garden that's
[10:19] right all right then in doing it see
[10:21] then she partook of the tree of
[10:24] knowledge of Good and Evil now what kind
[10:25] of a tree is
[10:28] that
[10:30] to partake is to eat thereof that's
[10:33] fine you know consume whatever you want
[10:37] to use the word there far but it was a
[10:40] tree of knowledge of Good and Evil well
[10:42] now I only know of one tree of knowledge
[10:45] of Good and Evil and that's Satan
[10:48] right Eve is not the tree of knowledge
[10:51] of Good and Evil Eve is a tree right we
[10:54] fall off of our mother the tree sure
[10:56] that's fine but she was not the tree of
[10:59] knowledge of Good and Evil right see
[11:01] that would have made her something that
[11:03] was wrong Satan was created correctly
[11:07] right right but by this time in the
[11:10] garden that the fall had taken place we
[11:13] know that Satan had already been kicked
[11:15] out of Heaven Sin had already originated
[11:18] in heaven and he got kicked out and he
[11:21] came to Earth and begin to pollute
[11:23] mankind you know the Eve in the garden
[11:25] and in doing that see then Satan is the
[11:27] tree of knowledge of Good and Evil
[11:29] and and I believe just like this I
[11:32] believe the seed of the serpent is still
[11:36] here see the seed of the serpent is
[11:39] unbelief the seed of the serpent is the
[11:41] Intercourse of the mind that uh Paul
[11:44] said I'm afraid that that Satan through
[11:47] his subtility would deceive you like he
[11:49] did
[11:50] Eve through the
[11:53] Mind here's where the battle starts it
[11:56] was not Eve the serpent that brought
[11:59] forth Cain it was even the
[12:02] Beast amen he was made a a snake he was
[12:06] made a serpent but he was an upright
[12:09] creature that would have been the link
[12:11] between man and the monkey and that's
[12:13] what you know Darwin couldn't figure it
[12:15] out they can't get that but if it had
[12:18] just been a little while and listen and
[12:20] read the Bible they'd have found it but
[12:23] anyhow just getting to the point just
[12:25] review a little bit Eve was seeking
[12:28] knowledge
[12:32] you say well there's anything wrong with
[12:33] seeking knowledge no not the right kind
[12:35] right you know but you go out there you
[12:37] look at the
[12:39] World by the world seeking knowledge
[12:41] what are they
[12:43] bringing
[12:45] death right sure I don't want to go back
[12:49] to the horse and buggy no I like our
[12:53] condition don't you you know I like a
[12:56] good home comfortable place that's fine
[13:00] but by doing all of that see like
[13:02] gunpowder you can go out and kill you're
[13:04] an animal and eat it but then you go out
[13:07] and kill people with it you know look at
[13:09] the automobile more people kill with
[13:11] automobile every year than any guns
[13:13] that's ever been right see that's the
[13:16] tree of knowledge of Good and Evil amen
[13:20] but then now we're going to outer space
[13:22] off of that tree right we keep eating
[13:25] and it just keeps increasing the way out
[13:27] until like in gen is it says nothing is
[13:30] withholden from
[13:33] man the imagination of man's heart is
[13:37] continually evil right but he's
[13:39] continually trying to do something with
[13:41] death we was listening the other day
[13:43] about brother randam saying it and you
[13:44] know it's true said that we've got spies
[13:47] in Russia he said they got spies here he
[13:49] said but we got very good close in uh
[13:52] you know uh allies like England he said
[13:55] but we have spies in England he said and
[13:57] they have spies here you know well why
[14:00] are you going to SP each other far if
[14:02] you're close friends CU there's always
[14:04] you don't trust
[14:06] nobody always trying to get Advanced and
[14:09] be ahead you know and and they get a
[14:11] bomb we want a bomb
[14:15] see but you see Church all we need is
[14:18] Jesus
[14:19] Christ all right that's the tree of life
[14:23] because the Bible said there was two
[14:24] trees standing in the garden amen one
[14:26] was a tree of life which was Christ
[14:29] himself there the other was the tree of
[14:31] knowledge of Good and Evil which was
[14:34] Satan right they surely partu of Satan
[14:36] in the wrong way if you even want to
[14:38] make it eat an
[14:40] apple go ahead but just remember it was
[14:43] a tree of knowledge of Good and
[14:45] Evil that you're having to talk about
[14:47] all right and we seen then as is saying
[14:50] the serpent seed today is right here now
[14:54] right Satan speaking in my mind and your
[14:58] mind right today trying to pervert us
[15:01] from the word of God
[15:04] Amen trying to change us from our our
[15:07] thinking the way that we should be right
[15:11] putting thoughts into our mind just the
[15:13] little things and all it takes is a
[15:14] saying that's right it don't take a big
[15:17] thing just a
[15:19] saying you can say to somebody said well
[15:21] what's brother so and so got to go oh
[15:23] forget it forget it I shouldn't have
[15:25] brought it up well you done planted a
[15:27] seed in the person's mind
[15:29] until they're
[15:30] tormented oh Bill Cunningham used to go
[15:32] to church with us years ago you could
[15:34] say that to him and for 3 Days he'd beat
[15:36] you to death just about it he he hounded
[15:38] you what's wrong what's that what they
[15:40] got against me some of you knew him and
[15:43] you know it was true but that's the way
[15:45] the human mind I don't care who you are
[15:46] that's the way your human mind works
[15:48] mine does yours does that's true Satan
[15:50] enters that human mind and that's what
[15:53] happened he entered that human mind of
[15:56] Eve and he brought her to a position
[15:58] position right all right right and see
[16:03] then once she
[16:05] partook then she took it to
[16:08] Adam and through her reasoning to Adam
[16:12] she brought him into a reasoning
[16:15] factor and brought death upon mankind
[16:18] because the Bible says and Adam all died
[16:23] right sure it would have been a problem
[16:26] to have said well why don't you just
[16:28] kill Eve and just forget
[16:31] it well see we want to go to the basis
[16:34] though on that we want to go and say
[16:35] well well that's true because he he
[16:38] needed a way to display his healer or
[16:40] savior Redeemer that's
[16:44] wonderful but now are you making
[16:49] your how can I say
[16:52] it are you making your excuse or
[16:55] reasoning for bringing
[16:57] something greater than God's purpose of
[17:00] being come on
[17:03] Amen you know maybe that's not the way
[17:06] of saying it but that's my point is that
[17:09] do we take things and say well this was
[17:12] going to
[17:14] happen well we know it was God knew it
[17:17] was right but did he make it
[17:20] happen that's what I'm getting at how
[17:23] could he make it happen and condemn us
[17:26] for being wrong amen
[17:29] but he permitted it to come into
[17:33] being all right he permitted it to come
[17:36] to a point of of being to where that
[17:38] mankind would reason he knew that was
[17:41] what would happen so he put us on free
[17:43] moral
[17:45] ageny where they are today we can reason
[17:48] out in our mind to accept this message
[17:50] and believe it or deny it and go
[17:53] on and people followed it 40 50 years
[17:57] and now turning against in in in all
[18:00] kind of
[18:01] things why because Satan still his seed
[18:04] of the
[18:08] serpent Cain was the seed of the beast
[18:10] in Eve but the prophet said you and I
[18:14] are a product of Eve and the
[18:19] Satan what's he dealing with the
[18:24] mind the mind is what keeps his problems
[18:27] doing the mind is where our trouble is
[18:30] at and that's where Satan went straight
[18:33] to that in the garden and he be to speak
[18:35] to her mind and got her to reason all
[18:39] right now he's doing the same thing
[18:42] right now to
[18:44] you I don't see anybody asleep right
[18:49] now so if you're not asleep your brain's
[18:52] got to be working and if your brain's
[18:55] working you're thinking if you're you're
[18:58] thinking you got a
[19:03] problem well I should have done this for
[19:05] left did I cut the iron off I don't know
[19:08] man you
[19:09] know that's that's
[19:13] life but you see that's what Satan works
[19:15] on all right but now listen before any
[19:21] woman if we're going to believe that Eve
[19:23] had a problem with the Beast and Serpent
[19:25] and Etc in the garden or eating apples
[19:29] whatever you're going to believe you're
[19:32] going to have to consider the fact that
[19:35] she accepted Satan's lie
[19:40] yes in her
[19:42] being and that caus her to do what she
[19:47] done now no woman can accept a man you
[19:51] know what I'm talking about in a sexual
[19:54] a
[19:56] fire unless you first reasons it out on
[19:59] their mind
[20:02] right all right and see when that
[20:05] happens then you're accepting that point
[20:08] in your
[20:09] mind and then the physical can take
[20:15] place see it's not the physical then you
[20:18] well I don't I didn't even think about
[20:21] that now you can play around in your
[20:23] brain if you want to but I ain't that
[20:25] done amen kind of a little too old for
[20:28] that
[20:29] we're not talking about rape cases we're
[20:31] not talking about somebody put in a coma
[20:33] and raped and stuff we' not do we've
[20:35] covered those
[20:36] things we're talking about human beings
[20:39] mortal
[20:41] right that are doing what they're doing
[20:43] see Eve accepted Satan's
[20:47] lie and then she was able to do what
[20:50] she'
[20:52] done all
[20:54] right see then I believe this what I
[20:57] wrote the seat of the serpent was and
[20:59] still
[21:00] is right now there still the same
[21:04] lie that the devil tells you right all
[21:09] right amen he's picking on
[21:12] you he he he he he's he's picking on
[21:16] me he he's really you know he does he he
[21:19] says he's not but he's picking on
[21:26] me even if if I am where does that
[21:29] change
[21:31] you right does that give you a right to
[21:34] get upset with me even if I called your
[21:37] name right and you guilty now if you're
[21:40] not guilty and I call your name then I'm
[21:42] the one that's
[21:43] guilty right right see that's what I've
[21:45] tried to get us to simply just sit down
[21:48] and think about things this time instead
[21:51] of just preaching quotes and and doing
[21:56] things and you just consider what's been
[22:03] said they brother around and said eve
[22:06] committed
[22:07] adultery there in the
[22:11] garden all right but see then our
[22:14] reasoning of our mind would come along
[22:16] because of what we've been
[22:18] taught they wasn't even
[22:21] married how could she commit
[22:25] adultery that'd be fornication well
[22:29] right you're going to dive right back
[22:30] over to where we read in Matthew
[22:32] 19:9
[22:34] right and you're in
[22:36] trouble fornication and adultery is the
[22:39] same word technically yes fornication is
[22:42] what a woman commits
[22:44] before she marries adultery is after but
[22:49] after a woman is married you can call
[22:50] her commit an adultery it's still
[22:52] fornication right those that's still
[22:54] unclean living amen that's right all
[22:56] right so Eve committed
[23:00] adultery he said but they wasn't married
[23:02] see there's your old denominational
[23:03] background and now your mind is thinking
[23:06] according to what you was
[23:10] taught right you're thinking according
[23:14] to what you were taught you're not
[23:15] thinking according to the word of God
[23:17] right you're thinking according to what
[23:20] you were taught and our Satan is just
[23:23] doing it you
[23:25] know he's still dealing in that mind
[23:28] through that serpent
[23:30] seed that he's planted cuz he has no
[23:33] seed of his
[23:34] own he perverts God's
[23:41] word all right now see we say but they
[23:45] wasn't
[23:46] married we'll get to that this afternoon
[23:49] more of a marriage and what it is and
[23:52] things but you better read in the
[23:54] Genesis account and notice in gen
[23:57] Genesis 2 I believe it is that two
[24:02] times God says that's Adam's
[24:07] wife now you you just go back there and
[24:10] read it all you want to and you know you
[24:12] can say but but no no no s it's what
[24:14] you've been
[24:15] taught exactly right we've been taught
[24:18] all of our life this is our right
[24:21] hand
[24:26] right we've been all of our life to
[24:30] we're on the top of the
[24:34] world well you know them people down
[24:37] underneath exactly you know they're not
[24:40] standing upside
[24:46] down I'm just trying to make you think
[24:51] sensibly think it over sensibly and
[24:54] you'll know a whole lot more than you do
[24:55] by trying to figure it out by revelation
[24:58] amen talking with somebody while ago and
[25:00] I said this certain person said they got
[25:03] a revelation is all right for them to
[25:05] marry and that was the fourth time so I
[25:08] guess they got four Revelations you know
[25:11] that
[25:13] was you remember the other week we were
[25:16] talking about that we need a revelation
[25:18] I don't agree with that Revelation now I
[25:21] don't think that fits too good but now
[25:24] think of
[25:26] it if Adam and Eve were one then she
[25:30] committed
[25:32] adultery he could have put her
[25:35] away and God would have killed
[25:41] her but he loved
[25:44] her she was a part of
[25:48] him
[25:49] and he went out of the garden thinking
[25:52] that he could bring her
[25:55] back but found out he was out of the the
[25:57] garden and couldn't get back that's
[26:02] right
[26:04] okay now we talk about yeah but we need
[26:07] this to bring forth the Healer the
[26:11] Savior but as I said a moment
[26:14] ago don't make the
[26:17] fall greater than the
[26:23] Savior sure God permitted this to happen
[26:27] where he could bring into
[26:30] being but did he deceivingly plan it to
[26:37] happen I put service at service about
[26:39] that you probably didn't agree with that
[26:42] but that's your business your mind
[26:45] thinking I have no control of
[26:49] that but yet God can't make us wrong and
[26:53] condemn us for being
[26:56] wrong but if he makes us
[27:00] perfect see right
[27:03] complete then we go wrong it's not his
[27:07] fault then he can display his
[27:11] attributes to
[27:14] redeem just don't make it to point that
[27:17] we stand back say well now he he already
[27:19] had that back here before it ever
[27:22] started you know well be careful you're
[27:24] planning
[27:26] things
[27:28] don't make God the author of
[27:31] confusion all
[27:34] right make it the way God brought it
[27:36] into
[27:39] being he didn't make us wrong he made us
[27:42] right every little
[27:47] baby even from prostitution or whatever
[27:51] that baby is born with an immune
[27:55] system placed within her unless it's
[27:57] something wrong we're talking about
[27:58] normal
[28:00] person with an immune system that'll
[28:03] fight off
[28:06] diseases
[28:09] right see God has a way provided like we
[28:12] found out from cattle and thing if that
[28:15] little baby cave don't get that milk
[28:17] from that mother and it's called
[28:20] colostrum or something like that similar
[28:22] to the word if they don't get that
[28:24] within a amount a few hours after
[28:26] they're born it don't matter if they
[28:28] live another week they're going to die
[28:30] most of them because there's just
[28:32] nothing they can do because there's
[28:33] something in that mother's
[28:35] milk that makes that that calf to be
[28:38] able to live and
[28:41] survive God Made A Way and made
[28:43] everything right we're the ones that's
[28:44] messed it up right amen by our own
[28:48] thinking or own
[28:50] ideas all right we studied that God in
[28:54] the beginning made one Covenant
[29:00] that was with Adam said do not
[29:03] partake of the tree of knowledge of Good
[29:06] and
[29:07] Evil all right Eve then being created
[29:10] from
[29:12] Adam and she was
[29:15] co-equal right right now everybody wants
[29:18] to holler and scream about she's the
[29:19] byproduct we know that but was she
[29:22] byproduct in a product or was she a
[29:24] byproduct to come out of a product or
[29:26] what kind of a by products you
[29:34] got see she was made that way
[29:38] sure where she could as a free moral
[29:41] agent go the wrong way and she did and
[29:44] then Adam went with her right all
[29:48] right then there was before then though
[29:51] there was just one
[29:55] Covenant that's right they were co-equal
[29:58] I believe she could move a tree in the
[29:59] garden as well as he could move a tree
[30:01] in the garden I believe she could speak
[30:03] the word as well as he could speak the
[30:04] word if you want my own personal opinion
[30:07] I believe that Adam would in the spoken
[30:10] word creation of all Humanity to bring
[30:12] forth the correct ones that he could
[30:15] have spoke it but he would have allowed
[30:16] her to say
[30:18] it why
[30:21] not does not God allow us to say it now
[30:24] are we not the byproduct of God
[30:29] no now don't call me a
[30:31] byproduct well what are
[30:35] you I got a few Choice words for that
[30:37] that I won't use but some of them's
[30:38] called
[30:42] dumb see instead of listening to God's
[30:44] word we want to reason it
[30:47] out and that's what happened in the
[30:49] garden amen isn't it
[30:53] sensible that you was made to bring
[30:56] forth
[30:58] and she
[31:02] was but now
[31:04] listen once the fall came then God had
[31:08] to make two covenants right amen
[31:12] right one with a woman one with a
[31:15] man not two covenants of Salvation not a
[31:18] way that he saved one way and she saved
[31:21] another way no it's the life that we
[31:25] live responsibility that we have your
[31:29] women are supposed to let your hair grow
[31:31] long not cut it but the men are supposed
[31:35] to cut their High that's Paul's
[31:39] saying men wees pants britches we call
[31:43] them women are not supposed to wear
[31:46] those things they're supposed to wear
[31:47] dresses right that's the two ways the
[31:51] prophet said a covenant it's life that
[31:54] we live the two
[31:56] Covenants
[31:58] and sure if she lives that Covenant to
[32:00] the tea in the correct order it will
[32:03] blend over
[32:05] into her salvation
[32:09] yeah cuz why is the woman given to the
[32:12] man not to reproduce the
[32:16] woman she was given to reproduce the man
[32:21] all now then if she was given to
[32:23] reproduce the
[32:25] man she just got in the way of how it
[32:28] was to come
[32:31] forth
[32:34] right and see in doing that then man was
[32:37] made to rule over
[32:40] her that's what it says in Genesis we
[32:42] read it we preached on
[32:45] it Andes and thy desire shall be to thy
[32:48] husband didn't say thy desire shall be
[32:50] to the
[32:52] neighbors and the people around you and
[32:54] every man that comes along supposed to
[32:57] be to your
[32:59] husband all right we went through that
[33:01] then polygamy came into
[33:04] being and as polygamy came into being
[33:07] then David could
[33:10] have 700
[33:12] wives but you know not one of those
[33:14] wives could have another
[33:18] husband Solomon had a
[33:20] thousand but not one of them women could
[33:22] have another
[33:25] husband see we say yes but but look at
[33:29] it just you
[33:32] know he's got a th
[33:35] wives you know wouldn't it be lonely to
[33:39] be married to a man with a thousand
[33:45] wives I mean every once in a while you
[33:47] see him walk by there goes my
[33:49] husband hi honey you remember me I'm
[33:55] 983
[33:59] it's truth ain't it that's
[34:02] right now you want my point of what I'm
[34:04] talking
[34:05] about is the last thing I want to talk
[34:09] about we say yes but it's a horrible
[34:13] thing living alone and not being
[34:25] married
[34:31] and I'm mean old guy a some men I'd
[34:35] rather be single than to be married to
[34:36] if I was a woman there's some women I'd
[34:39] rather be single than to be married
[34:43] to that's
[34:47] right you know we do have some Christian
[34:50] responsibility amen that's right right
[34:53] brother and I thought Christian
[34:55] responsibility was to pray and serve God
[35:02] Amen and that our lust and our thoughts
[35:04] was supposed to
[35:06] be placed away from
[35:15] us yeah we're human I'll try to get back
[35:18] to
[35:19] that but two covenants not about
[35:22] salvation right there's only one
[35:24] salvation that's through Jesus Christ
[35:26] amen
[35:29] but she has a certain responsibility
[35:31] according to Invisible Union if you read
[35:34] it and according to marriage and divorce
[35:36] a woman has certain responsibilities to
[35:38] live well we ought have that as a you
[35:41] know come on
[35:44] listen did brother brandom have to come
[35:46] and tell us how to
[35:51] live I'm waiting on that one did he have
[35:54] to tell us how to live
[35:59] I've heard preachers preach on don't
[36:02] tear down that pasture fence cuz that
[36:05] ain't a good Christian
[36:07] attitude if we tore down one when we was
[36:09] kid we got the daylight beat out of us
[36:11] and we put the fence up and had to hunt
[36:13] the neighbors
[36:14] cows so in the natural we didn't have
[36:16] any reason to tear down a
[36:21] fence they' run around and about to tell
[36:23] us it was wrong
[36:25] lust
[36:29] I never thought of that till the prophet
[36:30] said
[36:33] it well I guess you wouldn't a
[36:36] Christian where is oash and Christianity
[36:44] at what done away with oldfashioned this
[36:46] Christianity that's what I said I just
[36:48] want to preach today not read so
[36:50] much what happened to oldfashioned
[36:55] Christianity
[36:57] what happened with the fact that when
[36:59] you get married you're supposed to be
[37:04] married we covered in the New Testament
[37:07] there's no polygamy
[37:12] today R said I don't believe in polygamy
[37:14] amen he said it's wrong right sure he
[37:18] had to he was human being he said in
[37:20] countries where they practice it said
[37:21] they had a lot less
[37:23] trouble he
[37:25] did
[37:29] but see under
[37:30] polygamy the woman can't have no more
[37:39] husbands so do you say well well you
[37:41] know what no if you was in polygamy
[37:44] you'd have one husband and that would be
[37:45] the one you married to and it wouldn't
[37:48] matter if he had 999 more
[37:50] right you just found your place in the
[37:53] rank
[37:54] somewhere and stayed there
[37:57] but what happened to
[38:00] Christianity did Brother random have to
[38:02] come and tell us it was wrong to strip
[38:04] down and walk out on the streets naked
[38:11] women come
[38:15] on I thought oice and
[38:18] Christianity was supposed to taken care
[38:20] of a lot of
[38:23] things we standing yesterday
[38:27] in a place and this man I don't know
[38:30] where Mark brother Donnie one was stand
[38:32] there if you remember the man said he
[38:34] was from New Mexico and he said
[38:36] something about said I'm a Christian in
[38:38] just a minute they was words come out of
[38:39] his mouth it didn't sound too much like
[38:41] it you
[38:43] know but see that's just
[38:46] accepted
[38:49] yeah I I didn't cuss when I was a
[38:53] sinner and then I become a Christian
[38:55] then
[38:58] well it don't matter about them things
[38:59] you do and you
[39:03] say it
[39:08] doesn't we get to it this afternoon
[39:10] where the Bible says that by your words
[39:12] you'll be
[39:14] what Justified and by your words you'll
[39:17] be
[39:20] condemned but what happened to
[39:25] Christianity
[39:27] what happened to the New Birth is
[39:29] supposed to take away these
[39:33] things did brother randam have to come
[39:35] and tell us it was
[39:42] wrong I remember when I'm old enough I
[39:44] remember when ladies dress like ladies
[39:47] and men acted like
[39:51] men told you about it right there in
[39:53] front of my house where Wade lived there
[39:55] was a store
[39:58] the man was a carpenter and he had he
[40:00] was a farmer and raised cattle will you
[40:03] go to the store if was nobody there the
[40:04] doors open you went in and got what you
[40:07] wanted you wrote it down on a piece of
[40:09] paper if you didn't have the
[40:11] money and told the man what you got you
[40:13] went back and paid him if you didn't you
[40:16] laid the money down on the table and
[40:18] counted it out you
[40:21] know well he didn't have to worry about
[40:23] somebody stealing
[40:25] it would nobody steal that
[40:30] money what happened to
[40:35] Christianity does this message have to
[40:37] tell us how to
[40:46] live see it sounds like Satan's still
[40:48] working in his serpent seed line that's
[40:53] right that's right he said well brother
[40:56] D are you telling me that I'm
[40:59] lost why are you thinking
[41:05] that why are you thinking
[41:11] it but Satan through his subtility see
[41:14] brought this thing into being until our
[41:17] minds are perverted that's
[41:25] right she's no longer try to live a
[41:28] life and honor and respect and
[41:36] things you kids that are in school you
[41:38] know what I'm talking
[41:41] about a girl remains of Virgin she's a
[41:45] kind of a slided right you
[41:51] know she's not popular she's not in the
[41:54] In
[41:55] Crowd
[41:57] but it's like I've always told
[41:59] you you let that other girl go off and
[42:02] get into
[42:03] trouble y let her wind up with veneral
[42:07] diseases or some kind of a pragnant or
[42:10] something she'll run right back to that
[42:12] girl that she know is a virgin and
[42:15] she'll cry on her
[42:21] shoulder
[42:25] right
[42:26] did you see church have we lost
[42:28] Christianity and then we call it
[42:29] marriage and
[42:33] divorce if I get down there I want to
[42:36] say a few words see a lot of people
[42:37] didn't need don't I'm I'm honest I'm
[42:40] plain blunt I try to be that way I don't
[42:43] just you you know I'm not pulling tricks
[42:44] on you there's a lot of people that are
[42:47] free that if they just sit down and
[42:49] simply think about the scriptures they
[42:52] would be
[42:55] free
[42:57] because of the way the scriptures are
[42:58] laid out a lot of women are free if they
[43:01] knew what the scriptures are laid
[43:04] out but yet of our minds we're still
[43:09] bound mama said this daddy said that
[43:14] grandmother believed this
[43:17] okay they was responsible between them
[43:20] in
[43:21] God we're responsible for the
[43:25] word
[43:28] and see even the garden after the fall
[43:30] came there had to be two
[43:33] covenants one made to where that you
[43:38] sisters could live a life of being
[43:41] a virtuous
[43:44] person and why wouldn't you want to
[43:49] be why wouldn't you want to be a
[43:51] virtuous
[43:54] person come on children why would why
[43:56] don't you want to be well it wouldn't be
[43:59] popular is pregnancy
[44:02] popular is vano disease
[44:05] popular is every boy in this town
[44:07] knowing all about you
[44:14] popular just remember them little boys
[44:16] is full of the devil too you know oh
[44:19] they'll tell you oh I won't tell nobody
[44:23] else no not they get home get on
[44:28] the
[44:30] Facebook now they're what are they
[44:32] getting
[44:33] pictures
[44:37] right oh yes but he was my
[44:41] friend
[44:45] yeah but when Eve brought forth sin to
[44:49] Adam Adam accepted
[44:54] that because because he knew if he
[44:57] didn't it was death to
[45:00] her so he was willing
[45:03] to take her
[45:10] burden well I let my husband be the
[45:13] head you let him be your
[45:20] head you analyze that statement just a
[45:23] little bit right that's right I let my
[45:26] husband be the head you don't let Jesus
[45:28] Christ be your
[45:30] head you don't let him be your
[45:35] savior you better be glad you got one
[45:39] amen and honor and respect that head
[45:42] because of
[45:46] that
[45:51] right and see then polygamy came into
[45:53] being and when it did it's like a I was
[45:56] trying to explain how come it brought it
[45:58] into the animal
[46:00] race how come the animal race wound up
[46:03] into
[46:04] pamy I mean the human race is What
[46:08] fail but you realize we're the highest
[46:11] chain of the animal race amen right
[46:16] right the difference in us and the rest
[46:18] of the animals is is a soul making us a
[46:22] being in in the image of
[46:24] God
[46:27] but a higher form of an
[46:31] animal you see by doing that what did it
[46:34] release it released a spirit upon the
[46:37] people right and they went after it
[46:40] first account of polygamy in the Bible
[46:42] is about Genesis 4 layus had two
[46:45] wives Adam didn't have two wives he had
[46:49] a wife that committed
[46:51] adultery she had two
[46:54] husbands right
[46:57] right the beast in Adam right all
[47:04] right but it that spirit being released
[47:07] upon Mankind and their thinking it just
[47:11] automatically flowed right out into the
[47:12] human into the animal
[47:15] race and even though they didn't have a
[47:18] soul they have a life they have a being
[47:21] about
[47:24] them and it brought sin upon their
[47:30] situation one Buck many
[47:34] Do's you see if you stayed with a with a
[47:37] part in the garden where would we have
[47:40] been we would have never come into being
[47:43] that's plain lamage because it already
[47:45] slipped and fell and what can you do
[47:47] with
[47:49] it God permitted it to happen
[47:53] right and then when he permitted it to
[47:55] happen and he had to deal with
[48:00] it so he would actually take and have
[48:04] David
[48:05] having 700 wives or Solomon having a
[48:09] th and he'd use that to type Christ in
[48:12] the church to come on later cuz none of
[48:15] those women could have another husband
[48:17] right there was no
[48:22] way but now I tried to cover the point
[48:28] that the men don't like for it to be
[48:32] covered they like for you to preach
[48:34] about the woman that she can't
[48:36] marry but you remember it was a bunch of
[48:39] priest
[48:41] men it wasn't women questioning
[48:47] Jesus
[48:49] right it was men questioning Jesus amen
[48:53] can a man put his wife away for any
[48:55] cause or ever calls or whatever it
[48:57] say he said except it be for
[49:01] fornication if you put her away Matthew
[49:04] 19:9 for any other reason in fornication
[49:06] or saving except the same
[49:14] word look what
[49:16] happens
[49:17] well them Pharisees see they wanted it
[49:20] for any
[49:22] reason and you know what happened back
[49:25] there in the old days of Moses as
[49:27] Deuteronomy 24 is very
[49:30] blunt plain it doesn't tell you any way
[49:34] of making it to their hardness of their
[49:36] heart they took it in the hardness of
[49:39] their own Hearts to decide what was
[49:42] grounds and that's the way it is today
[49:47] that's but I've got grounds you can't
[49:49] tell me my brother-in-law told me one
[49:51] time we we wouldn't talk they were
[49:53] talking about it I sitting in the back
[49:54] of the car listening to him going deer
[49:56] hunting I was laughing because they were
[49:57] talking about marriage and divorce bunch
[49:59] of Baptist and things and he said you
[50:01] can't tell me I wasn't free to
[50:04] marry I ain't going to tell you I'm not
[50:07] going to tell you right I'm not going to
[50:10] say a word they got down there the
[50:12] hunting land and they all started
[50:14] getting out and somebody I forgot who it
[50:15] was there said Sam you ain't going
[50:16] hunting I said no I'm enjoying this I
[50:19] said some want stay here I want to hear
[50:21] the rest of this story you
[50:24] know but listen
[50:28] Church you can't tell nobody just done
[50:31] got their mind closed that's exactly
[50:34] right
[50:35] Amen brother lale had a statement of way
[50:38] of saying it he said our mind is
[50:39] crystalized on these things I wouldn't
[50:42] say that if I had heard him make that
[50:44] statement many times when you
[50:46] christianize a break shoe you throw them
[50:48] away right you can take them off and
[50:51] buff them and you got
[50:53] braks until you apply them about twice
[50:57] and then you got the same old slick
[51:00] situation and no breaks so throw them
[51:03] away
[51:05] right see when you're christianized on
[51:07] something that means you're not going to
[51:08] accept what anybody else says right
[51:14] right I told you about my brother-in-law
[51:16] as a Baptist preacher and me trying to
[51:18] show him that hell wasn't Eternal and he
[51:20] said if hell ain't Eternal I won't
[51:21] preach no more well who is he talking
[51:23] about God or me
[51:26] he was telling
[51:28] God if that wasn't
[51:31] right he wouldn't preach no
[51:34] more what about
[51:41] it see we went through trying to explain
[51:44] some things that her husband must be
[51:46] dead according to the scripture
[51:48] Corinthians we gave you Romans in
[51:50] different
[51:51] time Romans 7 especially that her
[51:54] husband must be dead
[51:57] did that's the only reason she can
[52:00] remarry I even got down to speaking
[52:03] natural I said women would say then well
[52:05] I'll just go kill the old boy and he'd
[52:06] be dead and they'll give me free to
[52:07] marry well that's okay you're free to
[52:09] marry but you're a murderer now what are
[52:11] you going to do and you plan to do it
[52:13] now what are you going to
[52:16] do I went through there this past week
[52:19] trying to be carnal on a lot of things I
[52:21] saying men are women you withhold
[52:23] yourself from your husband and cause him
[52:25] to go out or wife and cause him to go
[52:27] out and do wrong you're causing it
[52:30] that's right you so I just withhold
[52:32] myself the man would say I'll just
[52:34] withhold myself and she'll go out and
[52:35] get a man then I can divorce her for
[52:37] adultery brother Dale said There Brother
[52:39] Dale won't brother Dale going to ask you
[52:41] on
[52:42] question he going to talk to your wife
[52:44] and see how you dealt with
[52:49] that if you withhold yourself from her
[52:52] and you cause her to do that then you're
[52:53] not going to get me to have anything do
[52:55] with your
[52:59] marriage blunt Blain yeah but I thought
[53:02] the Bible said that way I didn't know
[53:05] there was but one grounds for a man to
[53:07] be able to divorce his wife and remarry
[53:09] I want to see it in the
[53:13] Bible I want to see it in brother
[53:15] Brown's
[53:20] message the word that you can just
[53:22] divorce your wife and Remar for any
[53:24] cause
[53:26] we went through it where brother R said
[53:28] you could divorce your wife for cutting
[53:30] her high but he says you
[53:32] cannot
[53:38] Remar
[53:42] okay but brother Dale you don't
[53:45] understand the man is he he's a yeah
[53:47] he's a hono muncho he he he can go out
[53:49] and do anything he want no he
[53:51] can't let me get back to what I said
[53:53] what happened to Christianity
[54:00] or you saying them people ain't saved
[54:03] they're between themselves and God I
[54:06] can't save anybody and I can't make
[54:08] anybody be
[54:09] lost but I can tell it like it
[54:13] is you see why we're in the mix up shape
[54:16] we're in the prophet why they say
[54:17] marriage and divorce need to be preached
[54:19] he said because of man's
[54:21] interpretation right mixed up theology
[54:25] made us in this
[54:31] situation but you see we think well
[54:33] Grandma was a good grandma but this is
[54:35] what she believed
[54:37] okay maybe that's all she
[54:41] understood you ever talk to people about
[54:43] something they say you and you ain't
[54:44] even said nothing you're talking to them
[54:45] about the message you telling me my mama
[54:47] wasn't
[54:50] saved that was in
[54:52] mind you didn't say anything thing it
[54:56] was in their mind
[54:59] wondering Remember Mama and Grandma
[55:02] answers to God themselves it's you and
[55:04] me that we're talking about that's amen
[55:08] all right now what
[55:12] then some people believe that you can
[55:14] put your wife away for fornication
[55:17] before
[55:19] marriage you know but then after you're
[55:21] married you could put her away maybe
[55:23] some would say but you can't read Mary
[55:25] well now I want to see that
[55:28] somewhere I want to see I want I want
[55:31] that in the scriptures I want that in
[55:32] the Bible you know I want it brother
[55:34] Brown's
[55:41] message a man can't put his wife away
[55:43] and marry again for just any
[55:46] reason he's got to have a scriptural
[55:49] reason all
[55:52] right we say well we got the quote FKS
[55:55] Brother D where it says if if she done
[55:57] it before marriage we got that but we
[55:58] don't have it where it says after
[56:02] marriage well I don't think there has to
[56:04] be any
[56:08] quote well who are you I'm me who are
[56:12] you I don't think there has to be any
[56:15] quote about
[56:17] it you mean a man's wife go out and
[56:19] commit adultery again he's supposed to
[56:21] keep
[56:23] her now you show me that in the Bible
[56:26] when when God put away Israel and
[56:30] married a gentile bride now I just want
[56:32] that one little
[56:39] Point well you got to live no you don't
[56:41] have to live in
[56:43] it and I've even told you sisters BL
[56:46] language I'm blunt on that you don't
[56:48] have to live with an adulterous man you
[56:51] just can't divorce him and
[56:53] Remar
[56:57] well I can't well the law says you
[56:59] can the law says he's going to keep them
[57:01] kids
[57:03] up and what's wrong are you a little
[57:05] lazy about getting out and get you a
[57:12] job maybe I'm too blunt I guess ain't I
[57:16] but I get the point across don't I
[57:18] that's
[57:23] right he even the laws of the land don't
[57:26] allow don't allow a man to be brutal or
[57:29] or mentally brutal Etc to a
[57:36] woman see
[57:39] that's yeah but brother I just couldn't
[57:41] make it by
[57:45] myself well is it better
[57:49] to live in a hell
[57:53] hole
[57:56] I'm plain right you know what I mean by
[57:58] that CH the words are not too good
[58:02] but when you get a situation let's go to
[58:05] that we'll quit in a minute cuz this is
[58:08] what you know this I wanted to review
[58:10] just a few things and then cuz see I
[58:14] believe that a man can put away his wife
[58:18] and marry
[58:20] again if she was untrue before marriage
[58:23] all right I believe that
[58:26] yeah and I believe that if his wife
[58:29] commits adultery I've always said it I'd
[58:31] be graceful I believe in
[58:34] grace if my wife came and told me she
[58:37] said honey I committed adultery with a
[58:39] man the other day I would question her
[58:41] to see if we could
[58:43] reconcile I could have been together 55
[58:46] years you know and I would try to be
[58:49] sensible and try to be a loving
[58:52] husband and I believe in forgiving
[58:58] now but I don't believe in it happening
[59:01] two or three more
[59:05] times I just number one is
[59:12] a and I'm also pling about
[59:19] this if my wife told me she committed
[59:22] adultery against me and I accept her
[59:25] back I'll never mention that
[59:28] again if I tell her I forgive
[59:31] her
[59:33] right I don't believe I can do that well
[59:36] then you need a little more praying you
[59:38] need a little more patience and
[59:40] knowledge and
[59:45] Temperance does God bring up everything
[59:48] you used to
[59:52] do does he bring up to life you used
[59:54] used to
[59:57] live because
[59:59] see by your words you be justified and
[1:00:02] by your words you be
[1:00:03] condemned you know it'd be hard to get a
[1:00:06] divorce against your wife if you told a
[1:00:07] judge said your honor I know she done it
[1:00:09] but I forgive her go to court and try it
[1:00:12] and see what they'll do with
[1:00:14] you they'll consider the fact that
[1:00:17] something could be reconciled and it
[1:00:18] won't
[1:00:19] work all so blunt about this and that's
[1:00:22] the way you have to be if my wife came
[1:00:23] and told me to day that she committed
[1:00:25] adultery against her I would leave the
[1:00:27] house that
[1:00:29] minute because if I stay in that house
[1:00:32] according to the laws of the state of
[1:00:33] Georgia and I spend a night in that
[1:00:35] house with her I've Justified her
[1:00:43] acts you can't go live with her for two
[1:00:46] or three weeks and then decides you want
[1:00:47] to get rid of
[1:00:49] her oh you make it right then blunt and
[1:00:53] plain well I didn't know that you do
[1:00:59] now but you see Church what happened to
[1:01:02] our Point what's happened to
[1:01:05] Christianity
[1:01:08] yes what's happened to
[1:01:11] the the things that we should
[1:01:17] be to some of you that are single that
[1:01:20] you know your husbands you're divorced
[1:01:22] or whatever they divorc you or whatever
[1:01:24] took
[1:01:29] place can I be plunt without being
[1:01:32] hateful you didn't enjoy the way it was
[1:01:35] or you wouldn't be divorced that's true
[1:01:37] is that being nasty no so what do you
[1:01:41] want another one
[1:01:44] for well you don't understand about
[1:01:46] being
[1:01:48] lonely hey I'd rather be happy and be
[1:01:52] lonely than be Mis
[1:01:55] miserable and W somebody laying the bed
[1:01:57] with
[1:02:00] me back what I said while to go what out
[1:02:02] to Christianity where we're supposed to
[1:02:05] pray well I'm just not made like you
[1:02:07] brother Dale don't you're made to be a
[1:02:10] Christian aren't you Christianity is
[1:02:12] supposed to take care of our needs of
[1:02:14] our body is that plain
[1:02:22] enough a lot of people married the
[1:02:24] second time that wish right now they
[1:02:26] wouldn't married to that second
[1:02:28] person well I think after a while I got
[1:02:31] this person in mind he married a couple
[1:02:33] you know he made bad choices both times
[1:02:36] well you know after a while you practice
[1:02:39] or to get better you you know I mean I I
[1:02:42] I just wouldn't get number three if I'd
[1:02:44] filed up on number one and
[1:02:47] two I'd change my
[1:02:50] choice I'm just being honest Why Can't
[1:02:53] We Be
[1:02:57] I thought Christianity was supposed to
[1:02:58] taken care of a lot of
[1:03:01] things we want an excuse to fall back of
[1:03:04] a marriage and divorce
[1:03:10] situation the Bible
[1:03:13] says that if a woman's husband be dead
[1:03:16] she's free to
[1:03:18] marry but it's got a stipulation in
[1:03:22] it you know what that is
[1:03:25] I heard it quoted somebody else want to
[1:03:27] try what is that
[1:03:28] stipulation says only in the
[1:03:32] Lord let's see pull that one up be
[1:03:36] number two on the notse that's 1
[1:03:37] Corinthians
[1:03:38] 7:39 well I just marry
[1:03:41] anybody there's where we messed up
[1:03:44] that's
[1:03:45] right that was our ideas and our
[1:03:48] thoughts but what does it say she's
[1:03:50] Liberty to be married to whom she will
[1:03:52] only in the Lord lord well now that
[1:03:56] doesn't say man D but you know I'm just
[1:03:59] too carnal to not believe that means a
[1:04:05] man we're not we're commanded in the
[1:04:07] Bible right I've got scriptures laying
[1:04:09] here and all but you ought to know it
[1:04:11] we're commanded to not marry unbelievers
[1:04:18] right you said well a lot of us did yeah
[1:04:20] and thank God they worked out am that's
[1:04:25] right
[1:04:27] right but we're commanded not to marry
[1:04:30] him be not unequally yolked together 2
[1:04:34] Corinthians
[1:04:35] 6:14 with
[1:04:41] unbelievers now you get in the message
[1:04:43] people and what to have uh my church is
[1:04:46] only believers they are so if you can't
[1:04:48] marry outside of my
[1:04:50] church now I've never said anything like
[1:04:53] that that's
[1:04:55] right what is a
[1:05:08] Believer well if they don't believe my
[1:05:11] that's what you're saying you got to
[1:05:12] marry inside the church then and you're
[1:05:14] putting it down to where you people got
[1:05:17] problems cuz how can they
[1:05:20] marry and you rule over them so much
[1:05:22] they can't marry nobody else but
[1:05:23] somebody in the group you're
[1:05:26] in what's a Believer what's an
[1:05:29] unbeliever
[1:05:30] amen you know that brother around them
[1:05:32] called Baptist Methodist Presbyterian
[1:05:34] Believers Catholic
[1:05:40] Believers but yet he was the one that
[1:05:42] emphasized the scripture brought being
[1:05:44] unequally Yol together with
[1:05:47] unbelievers he said you're not marry an
[1:05:53] unbeliever
[1:05:56] but check out about his daughter and see
[1:05:57] who she was dating when he passed
[1:06:01] away a good old
[1:06:05] Baptist yes but that's that's a day gone
[1:06:08] by now brother we in a different age now
[1:06:11] what age we're
[1:06:12] in yeah I agree we're in another age
[1:06:15] it's age of
[1:06:21] stupidity but what is a believer
[1:06:26] the Bible says you're only to be married
[1:06:27] in the
[1:06:33] Lord how many of us checked it out to
[1:06:35] see who we who our partners were if as
[1:06:37] Christians or whatever before we married
[1:06:39] my wife was a good Baptist she was
[1:06:42] a member of a Baptist Church you know
[1:06:44] when we married I was a member of
[1:06:50] nothing have we lost all of those
[1:06:53] scriptures
[1:06:56] right then we try to find some reason or
[1:06:59] excuse through brother brandom or some
[1:07:02] loophole to try to slide through and
[1:07:05] claim that we're
[1:07:10] Christians pull up number four and let's
[1:07:12] see what brother randam had to
[1:07:18] say this is taken from questions and
[1:07:21] answers on the seals in 63 324 paragraph
[1:07:24] 100 now as I can find see not as I can
[1:07:28] find cuz Paul said that the married
[1:07:30] couple if the companions dead then
[1:07:32] they're free then to marry whomsoever
[1:07:35] they will in the
[1:07:43] Lord one of my kids come and tell me he
[1:07:45] said I'm going to marry somebody that's
[1:07:47] not a Christian and say we ought not do
[1:07:49] it
[1:07:51] right you ought not do it cuz you're
[1:07:53] going to have
[1:07:54] problems but you're going to have
[1:07:56] problems if you marry one that's in the
[1:07:58] Lord so you going to have problems best
[1:08:01] answer to them and say going to have
[1:08:03] problems not a joke just
[1:08:06] trueu would you see
[1:08:11] church we were supposed to marry in the
[1:08:13] Lord if my wife
[1:08:16] dies I go down to the Baptist Church and
[1:08:18] start shopping for a
[1:08:22] wife when I'm in to you and Believers
[1:08:25] now we're we're a little closer now
[1:08:27] Believers there is a lot of Believers
[1:08:29] you know that's supposed to believe this
[1:08:31] message and you marry somebody that
[1:08:33] don't believe this message you're going
[1:08:35] to have
[1:08:36] problems you marry somebody that
[1:08:38] believes this message you're going to
[1:08:39] have
[1:08:41] problems
[1:08:44] right right plain but true amen but we
[1:08:49] could at least stay within our own
[1:08:51] groups our own you know not groups like
[1:08:53] this group here I'm talking about at
[1:08:55] least somebody believes the
[1:09:02] message it because you try to convince
[1:09:04] that girl or that boy tried to convince
[1:09:05] that you know the the girl and the boy
[1:09:07] tries to convince the girl you know vice
[1:09:09] versa that this message is right you got
[1:09:11] a lot of
[1:09:13] problems so we could at least say well
[1:09:15] we need to be Believers you know let's
[1:09:17] marry among the Believers and of this
[1:09:19] message you
[1:09:21] know and then we could do that and we as
[1:09:24] doing that then we wouldn't be having as
[1:09:26] much
[1:09:28] troubles the main thing is a lot of
[1:09:30] praying
[1:09:33] amen now how many in here prayed before
[1:09:38] you got
[1:09:40] married Bob and Monica's the only two in
[1:09:43] the building got their hands up there's
[1:09:46] yeah sister
[1:09:49] Anna but you know what I mean
[1:09:52] now Lisa had her hand up and oh she's
[1:09:56] pointing somebody else
[1:09:59] okay
[1:10:03] Prett you know what I'm doing you know
[1:10:06] what I'm serious about right not a joke
[1:10:08] you know I'm serious how many prayed
[1:10:11] really you know sincerely
[1:10:14] prayed for God to send you a good
[1:10:17] husband or a good wife that's right
[1:10:20] right no no we had that little old bitty
[1:10:23] word called
[1:10:26] lust you think what you want to I'm
[1:10:29] dirty mean old God do what you want to
[1:10:32] we marry on lust basis 99% of the
[1:10:36] marriages in the world is on the lust
[1:10:38] basis well let's say 80% because a lot
[1:10:42] of them makes
[1:10:43] her you know they just pick out who you
[1:10:45] going to marry and ain't no lust about
[1:10:46] it you going to marry him you going to
[1:10:48] marry her and Bo that'd be bad wouldn't
[1:10:52] it my wife got in trouble talking to a
[1:10:54] certain brother about it she said I
[1:10:56] wouldn't take responsibility for my
[1:10:59] kids said sister you know you kind of
[1:11:02] got her point was she might pick out the
[1:11:05] wrong one well we did couldn't get the
[1:11:08] word out of him but we got it out of his
[1:11:09] son yeah that's right you know we
[1:11:12] couldn't get it out of him because he
[1:11:13] was don't you know but his son said yep
[1:11:16] we find out we goof up a lot of times
[1:11:19] you know all right that's right but
[1:11:21] listen church are you serious minded
[1:11:27] thinking we're supposed to marry in the
[1:11:33] Lord
[1:11:35] right now the one other thing that I was
[1:11:38] trying to hit the last part you know
[1:11:41] whether it be man or
[1:11:42] woman for you to get married you're
[1:11:45] supposed to marry a
[1:11:50] virgin
[1:11:52] right
[1:11:54] what happened with the old
[1:11:56] Christianity we supposed to marry a
[1:12:05] virgin he started doing it that way
[1:12:08] brother Rand said if he even took and
[1:12:09] said how many virgins are singing in the
[1:12:11] choir and he didn't count women or men
[1:12:13] you know he just said virgins Paul
[1:12:15] speaks of a man having a virginity just
[1:12:17] the same way as a woman has
[1:12:20] one and he's Duty bound to keep his just
[1:12:23] like she Duty bound to keep hers of
[1:12:25] course now here's our thinking in our
[1:12:26] mind that Satan put in there it's okay
[1:12:28] for him I got where brother Bram said it
[1:12:31] he can do it but she can't now show me
[1:12:34] where brother Ram said a man can marry
[1:12:37] anything other than a
[1:12:44] virgin I want it in scripture I want in
[1:12:47] his
[1:12:52] message he said said but but but he can
[1:12:54] marry a woman that's been married
[1:13:00] before you said her husband's dead he
[1:13:02] can marry
[1:13:03] her if she wouldn't right to start with
[1:13:06] he's living in adultery do what you want
[1:13:09] to brother Dale's blunt that's right
[1:13:11] right but that's
[1:13:13] plain brother Ron said If a woman was a
[1:13:16] virgin she marries a man and her husband
[1:13:19] dies the Bible says she's free to marry
[1:13:22] right
[1:13:24] if she wasn't a virgin she wouldn't be
[1:13:26] free to
[1:13:28] marry is that
[1:13:31] plain I'll clap my own self on that
[1:13:34] because it's
[1:13:38] sensible she's not allowed to marry she
[1:13:40] ain't a
[1:13:42] virgin and he ain't
[1:13:51] either got a lot of lot of us in trouble
[1:13:54] ain't
[1:13:55] we I don't like the way you are oky doie
[1:13:59] I don't either but is the truth the
[1:14:03] truth you can stonewall me all you want
[1:14:06] to that don't
[1:14:07] work that's
[1:14:09] right listen Church we're commanded to
[1:14:13] marry in the Lord and we're commanded to
[1:14:16] marry a virgin whether you a man or a
[1:14:18] woman right you're commanded to marry a
[1:14:22] virgin
[1:14:26] Heaven Help before I would even my wife
[1:14:29] she was a virgin I wasn't and I don't
[1:14:31] mind telling it because it's truthful
[1:14:32] I'm
[1:14:35] straight but I would not marry her until
[1:14:38] I told her about my life and I was a
[1:14:42] sinner wouldn't saved until two years
[1:14:44] after we was married Mas that a year
[1:14:47] after in a Baptist Church wouldn't even
[1:14:50] save
[1:14:51] for I had enough of something about me
[1:14:53] and I told you before you you don't
[1:14:55] believe
[1:14:56] it the prettiest woman has ever seen in
[1:14:59] this part of the country I got out of
[1:15:01] the car and walked off cuz she was
[1:15:04] married I had a
[1:15:07] respect you can call that anything you
[1:15:09] want to I had a respect for a married
[1:15:16] woman what happened to real life in
[1:15:19] Christianity is in
[1:15:22] anything
[1:15:25] show me where a man is to marry anybody
[1:15:27] he wants to well David married AB after
[1:15:31] her husband was dead
[1:15:36] that's is that
[1:15:40] true if she wasn't a virgin when she
[1:15:42] first married the first man was supposed
[1:15:44] to put her away that's Deuteronomy
[1:15:52] 24
[1:15:54] so if you wasn't a virgin and you're
[1:15:56] married you're
[1:16:01] wrong he said well I told him about okay
[1:16:03] that's fine he accepts that he accepts
[1:16:06] the
[1:16:08] responsibility that's your business then
[1:16:10] that's between you and God there's no
[1:16:12] grounds for a man or a woman neither
[1:16:14] one to marry outside the
[1:16:20] Lord there's no grounds to marry except
[1:16:23] you're a
[1:16:28] virgin yeah but Brother D I don't like
[1:16:30] that because a man can man can what a
[1:16:33] man can put away his wife and marry
[1:16:35] again if he does it in the
[1:16:42] Lord and if he does it in the Lord he'll
[1:16:45] marry
[1:16:47] virgin she is a virgin to start with
[1:16:50] married a man he dies she's still a
[1:16:54] virgin or else it would be wrong to
[1:16:57] marry a woman that had been
[1:16:59] married
[1:17:01] before
[1:17:04] right come on are you
[1:17:07] listening right if she wasn't a virgin
[1:17:10] you can't marry her I don't care who she
[1:17:13] is well you're only dealing with the the
[1:17:16] bases of the man
[1:17:21] do here you're only talking about a
[1:17:24] priest no we'll get down stronger on
[1:17:25] that one that's
[1:17:28] right a regular person anybody else you
[1:17:31] know some of you your wife died you can
[1:17:34] marry again and you don't have to be
[1:17:36] choicy but you got to be choicy about it
[1:17:38] being a virgin now you show me where
[1:17:41] that ain't
[1:17:43] right you got a man
[1:17:48] virgin whether it's man or
[1:17:52] woman
[1:17:55] see then when you come down to it you
[1:17:57] say well he can divorce her and go
[1:17:59] remarry but he can only marry a virgin
[1:18:01] he can only marry in the Lord he's not
[1:18:03] supposed to marry an unbeliever he's not
[1:18:05] supposed to marry somebody that ain't a
[1:18:07] virgin but if her first husband is dead
[1:18:09] and she was a virgin to start with she's
[1:18:11] still a virgin or else Jesus was wrong
[1:18:14] when he would talk about it when they
[1:18:15] question him about the
[1:18:17] man right that her husband the woman
[1:18:20] that her husband died she married again
[1:18:22] he died the husband died hadn't died
[1:18:24] about six or seven times they said said
[1:18:26] when he get to heaven who's going to be
[1:18:27] who right
[1:18:29] yeah he didn't argue about their
[1:18:31] situation is okay for them to
[1:18:36] marry come on does everybody understand
[1:18:39] what I'm
[1:18:41] saying man or woman is supposed to marry
[1:18:43] a virgin
[1:18:49] right and see if her husband is dead
[1:18:56] Dead come on if he's dead she was a
[1:19:00] virgin to start with her husband is dead
[1:19:02] she's still a
[1:19:04] virgin a man can marry her because it's
[1:19:08] legally right but a preacher can only
[1:19:11] marry a
[1:19:13] virgin a woman that's never been touched
[1:19:16] by man even the prophet will tell
[1:19:19] you and then the only one he can marry
[1:19:22] that's ever been married married as a
[1:19:23] widow of a priest but she can't have had
[1:19:28] a problem in her life and him marry her
[1:19:31] my Lord Brother Dale where in the world
[1:19:32] are we all at we're all messed up that's
[1:19:34] the best thing to say all lost and
[1:19:37] undone and on our way to hell and
[1:19:39] deserve
[1:19:40] it thank God for
[1:19:46] Grace why did that Prophet come in he
[1:19:49] said take your
[1:19:51] wife
[1:19:55] you know that the Catholic church has a
[1:19:56] way of
[1:19:58] doing the Catholic church has a way of
[1:20:00] doing that if a woman has been you know
[1:20:02] had a husband or had boyfriends or
[1:20:04] whatever they get ready to get married
[1:20:06] they just go down to the
[1:20:08] priest he does certain things of course
[1:20:10] it cost her probably a lot of money but
[1:20:12] she does certain things and he sprankle
[1:20:14] salt on her turns her around she goes
[1:20:15] back she's free to marry that's Catholic
[1:20:19] church right sis she just said she
[1:20:22] didn't know she know just try to
[1:20:25] get and here comes a brother along in
[1:20:28] this message a preacher that's had a big
[1:20:31] following I don't know what he is now
[1:20:32] cuz I don't worry about
[1:20:34] it said he spoke virginity into this
[1:20:37] woman's
[1:20:39] body and I knew there's something about
[1:20:41] that so it took me a long time to be
[1:20:43] able to find it I finally found where
[1:20:46] the Catholic say that brother Brown was
[1:20:49] the one that said they say
[1:20:51] it that they speak virginity
[1:20:54] back you can't speak virginity
[1:20:59] back we're going to get down to
[1:21:01] Invisible Union I hope you're reading it
[1:21:03] if that old denominational husband ain't
[1:21:06] dead that's right you got two
[1:21:10] husbands it's not how many wives you got
[1:21:14] brother Hans had a good point on that
[1:21:16] that's what he said he said it ain't all
[1:21:17] them wi I shouldn't have said his name
[1:21:19] there but he said it many times from
[1:21:21] here his a't how many wives I've had he
[1:21:24] says how many husbands I've
[1:21:28] had brother Mo used to preach a message
[1:21:30] call are you married to Adam or
[1:21:36] Christ you understand what I'm
[1:21:39] saying remember if her husband be dead
[1:21:42] she's as a virgin if she is a virgin to
[1:21:45] start with she's still a virgin or else
[1:21:48] your marriage and divorce would be wrong
[1:21:50] I'm talking about brother brand on
[1:21:51] marriage and divorce
[1:21:55] right if she ain't a
[1:21:57] virgin yeah but I don't oh get off you
[1:22:01] silliness you know what I'm talking
[1:22:06] about she's still holy and
[1:22:12] clean though she marries the second man
[1:22:14] if it's free and right then she's holy
[1:22:16] and
[1:22:20] clean not talking about your
[1:22:25] human
[1:22:30] parts or else I'll ask you some
[1:22:32] questions and it'll end it with it is a
[1:22:35] rape a
[1:22:40] marriage you better be careful what you
[1:22:42] say about those
[1:22:44] things I happen to can handle a
[1:22:46] scriptures a little where if a man find
[1:22:48] a woman out in a field and he lay with
[1:22:51] her that's right he's got to marry
[1:22:56] her you want brother Brown's words and
[1:22:59] you want his words of this I was looking
[1:23:01] at it this
[1:23:03] morning he said if that man does that
[1:23:06] woman
[1:23:08] wrong you know takes her lays with her
[1:23:11] he's got to marry her and
[1:23:15] said now I'm quoting him he can never
[1:23:19] put her away even though she become a
[1:23:26] prostitute you want that
[1:23:30] quote that's what your Prophet had to
[1:23:33] say we don't play games with
[1:23:37] Christianity you don't play games with
[1:23:39] the Bible well can a man put his wife
[1:23:41] away for any
[1:23:43] cause well why did Moses do
[1:23:51] that straight
[1:23:55] sorry but I have to answer to him for
[1:23:58] what I say a lot of times I goof up and
[1:24:00] say things that are not
[1:24:02] right but my heart's
[1:24:05] right I'm trying my best to help
[1:24:08] you and I'm sorry for being the way that
[1:24:10] I am but I'm trying to help you cuz I'm

[1:24:21] you if anybody has a
[1:24:24] need love
[1:24:27] you
[1:24:29] I
[1:24:31] love
[1:24:34] because he
[1:24:36] first
[1:24:39] Lov and
[1:24:42] Pur my
[1:24:51] Sal
[1:24:55] he said brother Dale brother so and so
[1:24:57] can preach it so
[1:24:59] sweet and I just oh I just love to hear
[1:25:01] them
[1:25:03] preach a lot of times you don't even
[1:25:05] know what the preachers are saying when
[1:25:06] they're so fast and like popcorn running
[1:25:10] you don't know what theyve
[1:25:15] said but you sit down and think that's
[1:25:20] right what happened to your old way of
[1:25:24] Christianity that we were supposed to
[1:25:26] live right and do right before we ever
[1:25:28] heard of this message this message
[1:25:30] doesn't have to tell us how to
[1:25:36] live probably said adulter is wrong you
[1:25:39] don't have to have the Bible to tell you
[1:25:46] that what about
[1:25:49] it
[1:25:51] father we just thank you for your love
[1:25:53] and your grace unto us and we ask you to

[1:26:00] best to help the people and I'm sorry
[1:26:02] Lord I just don't have the ability to be
[1:26:04] anything other than what I am and I'm
[1:26:07] sorry but we try to lay in your word and
[1:26:10] study it and and be ready and speak
[1:26:12] about
[1:26:15] you because there's just one thing
[1:26:17] involved and that's you Lord you are
[1:26:20] truly our husband and that old
[1:26:22] denominational husband ain't dead we're
[1:26:24] still thinking our own ways of marriage
[1:26:26] and divorce and our thoughts and
[1:26:29] ideas but
[1:26:31] Lord we're supposed to be married to
[1:26:36] you just forgive us Lord and gu us have
[1:26:40] your way with us be with everybody as we
[1:26:41] go eat a meal brag us back together this
