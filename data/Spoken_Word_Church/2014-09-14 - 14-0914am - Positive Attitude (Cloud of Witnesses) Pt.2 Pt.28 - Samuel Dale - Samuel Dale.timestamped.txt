[8:03] turning your scriptures turn we're gonna
[8:06] read our scriptures and then brother
[8:08] Hank has a word for this testimony he
[8:11] wants to thank the people but if you'd
[8:13] like turning your scriptures turn to
[8:14] Hebrews 11
[8:16] and we will begin reading
[8:20] um
[8:21] verse 39 and 40. and then we will go to
[8:25] chapter 12 verse 1 and 2 and maybe we
[8:29] will begin to get into that point but we
[8:33] want to talk a little bit about the
[8:34] things you know that has been made known
[8:37] to us in this last days that we thank
[8:39] God for
[8:41] Heavenly Father we thank you for all of
[8:43] the day and the love and the all things
[8:45] we pray that you would just bless us now
[8:48] as we meditate upon you that as we lord
[8:51] speak about you
[8:53] then you come on the scene Lord and and
[8:56] make yourself known because that's our
[8:58] desire in our hearts
[9:00] first off forgive our sins to where that
[9:03] we can all stand completing you
[9:05] and then direct us in your loving grace
[9:08] bless all of the visitors with us today
[9:10] and may you open our eyes as we sang
[9:13] unto you of understanding that we may be
[9:16] able to hear from you
[9:19] and Lord just teach us and help us and
[9:21] guide us remember the sick among us
[9:23] because you said you sent your word and
[9:25] healed us and delivered us from
[9:26] destruction so we believe you we thank
[9:29] you in Jesus name amen
[9:32] let's just read the scripture and
[9:34] yeah
[9:37] verse 39 Hebrews 11. and these all
[9:41] having obtained a good report through
[9:43] faith
[9:44] received not the promise
[9:47] no nail it into your heart and your mind
[9:49] in your reading
[9:51] they didn't receive the promise what is
[9:53] it they didn't receive all right God
[9:55] having provided some better thing for us
[9:59] that they without us should not be made
[10:02] perfect now that's not trying to raise
[10:06] them up and make Perfection that means
[10:08] to be complete a full age full-grown
[10:12] whatever uh it's not that we're going to
[10:16] raise the dead and then we're going to
[10:17] make them perfect that's not the way it
[10:19] is something has to happen for them to
[10:21] be come to full age or full or to the
[10:24] fullness of what they were starting out
[10:26] to be all right then verse 30 verse 1 of
[10:30] chapter 12 wherefore are therefore see
[10:34] change that word to therefore it'll help
[10:37] you to understand therefore seeing we
[10:39] also are compassioned about with so
[10:41] great a cloud of witnesses let us lay
[10:44] aside every weight and the sin which
[10:46] does so easily beset us and let us run
[10:50] with patience the race that is set
[10:52] before us
[10:54] looking unto Jesus the author and finish
[10:56] of our faith who for the joy that was
[10:59] set before him endured the cross
[11:01] despising the shame and he sat down at
[11:03] the right hand of the Throne of God you
[11:07] may be seated the Lord had his Blessing
[11:09] brother Hank had a word he wants to
[11:11] thank the church and offer Anthony come
[11:13] on you know
[11:19] first I'd like to thank all y'all for
[11:22] helping me and my wife Martha's doing
[11:23] good oh
[11:25] and I want to ask the church to forgive
[11:26] me I'm I made a lot of mistakes and all
[11:29] y'all helped me a lot and I don't want
[11:31] to let y'all down
[11:32] Brother Martin Donnie has went out on
[11:36] the limb for me many times so far I
[11:38] don't want to ask y'all to forgive me
[11:40] for any mistakes I've made y'all please
[11:42] forgive me uh I won't ask you to forgive
[11:45] me too
[11:46] for not being here when I should be here
[11:48] you've been good to me and I thank you
[11:50] the church has been good to me and my
[11:52] wife and I love y'all and I thank y'all
[11:54] Amen in Jesus name amen thank you amen
[11:58] amen
[12:07] now
[12:09] we've been quite a while in a series to
[12:11] the visitors we won't try to leave you
[12:14] behind and
[12:16] you know without knowing what we've been
[12:18] trying to do
[12:20] um
[12:21] we've been reading and studying in the
[12:23] chat Hebrews 11th chapter
[12:26] of all of these great warriors of faith
[12:29] all right and they all now
[12:33] we've been over and over it you'll find
[12:36] in verse 2
[12:38] that they obtained a good report through
[12:40] faith
[12:42] all right
[12:43] now then
[12:45] you keep reading a little bit and you
[12:49] find over in verse 13. these all died in
[12:52] faith having
[12:54] see not having received the promises
[12:58] all right then we read here in Hebrews
[13:00] the 11 39
[13:03] that all of these haven't obtained a
[13:06] good report through faith
[13:10] received not the promise
[13:14] all right
[13:16] and then he concludes it by going into
[13:18] verse 40 and says God having provided
[13:22] some better thing for us
[13:25] me
[13:26] that they without us
[13:29] should not be made perfect
[13:32] all right
[13:34] now
[13:35] I've tried to make a point to you to to
[13:38] illustrate it
[13:39] uh why would Paul spend the whole
[13:42] chapter talking of the great warriors of
[13:45] faith that these things happen you know
[13:48] stop them out of line say uh you know
[13:51] Enoch and Noah and uh Abel and the great
[13:55] Abraham and the great Moses and each one
[13:59] of those talking about
[14:02] that they did obtain
[14:04] in their day
[14:07] what God spoke of
[14:09] amen all right
[14:11] they did achieve those things by faith
[14:14] or through faith every which way you
[14:16] you're transport you know putting it all
[14:18] right and then why would Paul say that
[14:23] after they had done what God ordained
[14:25] for them to do in each age as they were
[14:27] living but he would say
[14:30] that
[14:31] they never
[14:33] received the promise
[14:36] all right
[14:38] now he left that at a point to to for us
[14:42] to think about I believe that you know
[14:44] they did achieve what was they were told
[14:46] everybody understanding they done those
[14:49] things but why would the Apostle Paul as
[14:52] we know as he was writing of the great
[14:54] obituaries of each one of these and and
[14:56] you know telling that and not not
[14:59] telling all of the things I like the way
[15:01] the prophet said it one day he said look
[15:03] at it like this he said dire Abraham
[15:06] lied give his wife away and everything
[15:07] else which said when God wrote his
[15:10] obituary over in Hebrews 11 said he
[15:12] never mentioned that
[15:14] why because God was not looking at what
[15:17] was going on he was looking at what he
[15:21] promised
[15:22] to do and that he would take care of
[15:25] things all right then in doing that then
[15:28] we know that there's a set and I keep
[15:30] repeating because I want that in your
[15:32] mind so when when we say something in a
[15:34] second it won't flip back and what is he
[15:36] talking about see and just keep it in
[15:38] your mind to one thing they did achieve
[15:41] what God said they would do
[15:44] all right
[15:46] but evidently they were something liking
[15:51] what's a better word for it I don't have
[15:53] that much education but you know
[15:55] something that was never fully achieved
[15:58] let's put it that away maybe by them all
[16:01] right
[16:02] and uh then he turned around and he says
[16:05] all right now they didn't get it
[16:08] they never received a promise
[16:11] and he calls it promises during one of
[16:13] them
[16:15] and he concludes it by
[16:17] you know I like the way Paul does Paul
[16:20] will lay down a great story a great
[16:22] thing
[16:23] and get everything lined up real good to
[16:26] where that he has the entire Bible
[16:28] behind him as a background and then all
[16:31] at once he'll just
[16:33] lay something on you as we call it and
[16:36] he'll say something that is outstanding
[16:39] all right so he does here he said
[16:41] something really outstanding God provide
[16:44] having provided some better thing for us
[16:47] that they without us
[16:49] should not be made perfect
[16:52] all right as I said a moment ago we know
[16:54] that we're not going to wait to one of
[16:57] these days and the Dead's going to raise
[16:58] and we're going to preach some message
[17:00] to these Old Testament Saints because
[17:02] that is the Old Testament Saints there
[17:05] is not a listing in the Hebrews 11 of
[17:08] the New Testament group this is the Old
[17:11] Testament Saints all right now brother
[17:13] Branham did use it on the Statue of a
[17:16] perfect man to relate down to the ages
[17:20] and we know that they down to the ages
[17:24] see there is something there and that's
[17:27] what we've tried to speak about
[17:30] and using what they were back there
[17:33] now what was it they never attained into
[17:38] all right now the Old Testament Saints
[17:41] never attained unto eternal life
[17:45] in their soul
[17:47] because that was withholding from them
[17:50] all right then Jesus saying come unto me
[17:54] all ye that are labor and heavy laden
[17:57] and I'll give you rest
[17:59] all right now Hebrews Paul covers it
[18:03] then later he's talking about they
[18:05] didn't enter into the rest you remember
[18:07] that in the scripture all right they
[18:09] never entered into the rest that was
[18:12] spoken of they rejected that we call it
[18:15] rejecting the right of sonship or are
[18:18] the children of God and and rejecting
[18:20] those things because it was for them
[18:23] we Gentiles had no promises we had a few
[18:25] types and shadows laying throughout the
[18:27] word but no great promises to us
[18:30] Gentiles it was really built to the Jews
[18:33] the oracles or the law came to the Jews
[18:36] adoption Paul said pertain to the Jews
[18:39] all of these things was pertaining to
[18:42] the Israelites or the Jews as we call it
[18:45] we know all Israel is not Israel all
[18:46] Jews are okay but the point I've been
[18:50] trying to make
[18:52] is that why would then he say that they
[18:55] without us
[19:00] should not be made perfect
[19:02] so there's a connecting some way to you
[19:05] and I
[19:06] or else Paul is
[19:09] um
[19:11] Rome
[19:15] because he's saying it himself
[19:18] he's making the connection and he says
[19:21] then that without us they cannot be made
[19:23] perfect look that word perfect up it's
[19:26] not talking about sinless perfection uh
[19:29] stuff like that or some way you could
[19:31] raise them and preach something to them
[19:33] that would make them perfect no it's not
[19:35] speaking that away it's speaking of
[19:37] completeness or full grown where it says
[19:40] in Matthew 5 48 be therefore perfect
[19:43] even as your father in Heaven is perfect
[19:45] that's not talking about sinless
[19:47] perfection that's talking about full
[19:50] grown
[19:51] all right maturity or are accomplishing
[19:56] what you were really set out to be
[20:00] you know Israel was set out to be the
[20:02] people of God right he came to his own
[20:04] his own received him not but as many as
[20:06] received him gave you what power to
[20:08] become the sons of God right but to
[20:11] Israel as a whole rejected salvation
[20:14] all right
[20:16] now maybe you don't follow me and I'm
[20:18] audience speaking but I just say what I
[20:21] believe
[20:22] all right see then when the Old
[20:24] Testament people turned down the right
[20:28] of sonship and killed a messiah
[20:31] see then he could turn to the Gentiles
[20:36] which word Gentiles means Nations so the
[20:38] biggest portion of the early church was
[20:40] even until the first church age was
[20:42] almost all Jews and things but it
[20:45] Gentiles it just means Nations you know
[20:47] a kingdom was coming to the Nations Paul
[20:49] spoke of it in his writings you know the
[20:52] great mystery that the coming in of the
[20:54] Gentiles all right which means Nation
[20:57] see a Jew can be in this nation this is
[20:59] any Nation anybody can be uh Born Again
[21:02] In This Kingdom that is here because but
[21:06] it's just listed as Gentile all right
[21:09] then in doing it
[21:12] see then he says that there won't be
[21:14] made perfect they won't be complete
[21:16] without us
[21:17] now I asked this simple question because
[21:19] I'm simple-minded all right
[21:24] what would have happened had Israel and
[21:27] we know they didn't know
[21:29] They didn't accept Jesus Christ when he
[21:31] came right
[21:33] few of the people in there accepted him
[21:37] but as a whole they did not accept him
[21:40] all right
[21:42] so we know that they did not accept
[21:44] eternal life
[21:46] now what would have happened had it went
[21:49] on without God coming in to make
[21:51] something uh
[21:55] to work out
[21:58] so he turns to the Gentiles
[22:03] and the Gentiles accept salvation
[22:06] and you realize by us accepting
[22:09] salvation then the Jews would not be
[22:12] obliterated from the Earth
[22:15] is that Paul in the Romans
[22:18] that we better not glory in our own
[22:20] selves we glory in The Roots which Our
[22:23] Roots are Jewish
[22:24] all right you might not like no
[22:26] connection to him but there's one thing
[22:28] about it they the gospel came from them
[22:30] to us
[22:31] all right and if it hadn't been for them
[22:33] turning it down
[22:36] and Paul said God blinded them
[22:40] but he said one day then all Israel will
[22:42] be saved all right we know there is a a
[22:45] group of people back there that I hope
[22:47] you don't misunderstand me in saying it
[22:50] those people of the Old Testament never
[22:52] received eternal life because the Bible
[22:54] said Jesus Christ had not been glorified
[22:57] all right how could they receive eternal
[23:00] life in their soul they would have to go
[23:02] to paradise and wait
[23:05] all right
[23:06] they would have to have a place to wait
[23:08] because they could not step forth
[23:11] themselves
[23:12] because they did not have any way of
[23:15] receiving eternal life into their soul
[23:17] that would require Jesus Christ dying on
[23:21] the cross God himself climbing up on the
[23:24] tree dying to release the life that was
[23:26] within him and that that life that was
[23:29] in him would be able to come back upon
[23:31] the believer to give us a new birth all
[23:34] right that was what Israel rejected
[23:37] but my point has been on one thing
[23:40] what if we hadn't accepted it
[23:43] it would have ended everything but the
[23:45] fact that we did accept it
[23:48] you see where it puts the connection to
[23:50] Israel
[23:52] that they cannot come to the place
[23:56] that was even ordained for them to be
[24:01] they cannot come there without you and I
[24:03] why because we've got to come forth in
[24:08] this days to the Gentiles
[24:10] and we got some things that's got to
[24:12] take place
[24:13] and that without us you'll see they
[24:16] couldn't be made perfect all right quick
[24:19] run through in the church ages they did
[24:21] receive eternal life on the death
[24:23] Pentecost
[24:24] hch had the baptism of the Holy Ghost it
[24:27] was the Holy Ghost in every Age The
[24:28] Prophet said all right
[24:31] but then they would be connected waiting
[24:33] on you and I
[24:34] that's right
[24:37] we'll read it in a second we're they're
[24:39] waiting on you and I
[24:41] see because they cannot come to their
[24:44] completeness
[24:46] now Israel couldn't come to eternal life
[24:49] because they turned it down
[24:53] right
[24:55] all right down to the ages those people
[24:58] could not come to
[25:01] eternal life and flesh
[25:03] not if they turned it down it's because
[25:05] it was withholding Paul would prophesy
[25:08] of it
[25:09] you know change in a moment a twinkle of
[25:12] an eye strong you know Trump is your
[25:14] sound Etc
[25:16] see it was sealed up
[25:19] just as the Gentiles coming into to be
[25:22] part of of to be the bride of Christ was
[25:25] sealed up in the scriptures in a mystery
[25:27] until it was brought forth amen all
[25:30] right so is it a mystery that somebody's
[25:33] going to be changed well all right those
[25:35] waiting in the grave there's no way for
[25:38] them to come back because according to
[25:41] my Bible it says the dead in Christ
[25:43] shall rise first
[25:46] all right
[25:47] so they have a resurrection
[25:49] right they died in the resurrection
[25:52] they're sealed in the resurrection all
[25:54] right but said
[25:57] the dead in Christ shall rifle and we
[25:58] which are alive and remain is going to
[26:00] be changed all right so then a lot of
[26:03] people's trying to find a Rapture are
[26:06] called away
[26:07] you better be kind to find a
[26:09] resurrection
[26:11] all right that's just a point you want
[26:14] to find a Rapture oh we want to go into
[26:15] rapture
[26:16] I've got one I hope I can find it right
[26:19] around them said it and I was in the
[26:21] office I'm sure
[26:23] he said this man was talking about going
[26:25] to heaven
[26:26] and he said he was talking about how
[26:28] that he was loading up to go to heaven
[26:32] he said
[26:35] I'm not loading up to go to heaven
[26:40] you remember what he said
[26:41] he said I'm unloading
[26:45] that's different ain't it that's
[26:47] different from anything we ever thought
[26:49] of
[26:50] yeah he said I'm unloading I'm getting
[26:53] rid of all of these things that bind me
[26:56] here
[26:57] the word that I can go to heaven I told
[26:59] you 20 years ago I said I quit trying to
[27:02] go to heaven why because I realized
[27:04] heaven's got to come here to take me
[27:06] there that's explained right all right
[27:10] then in doing that then
[27:12] those New Testament Saints
[27:15] there have no connection to their
[27:17] glorified body outside of you
[27:21] see you've got to pull them out
[27:25] the dead has got to be raised
[27:26] something's got to cause it
[27:28] well there's many philosophies among the
[27:31] message people but you know it's all
[27:33] right you believe what you want to
[27:34] believe whatever what it is irregardless
[27:37] of what your philosophy is it better be
[27:40] connected to a resurrection
[27:42] because that is the next thing it is not
[27:45] the Rapture the Resurrection comes then
[27:48] you can talk about a rapture
[27:50] all right
[27:51] because that's that would be scriptural
[27:53] all right so then that would put the Old
[27:56] Testament people
[27:58] dependent upon you and I
[28:01] because we did accept the Salvation And
[28:06] by us accepting it God simply blinding
[28:09] his people
[28:11] for you and I
[28:13] amen you know the Bible says one day
[28:16] their eyes will be opened
[28:18] all right we know that there'll be a
[28:20] group called 144 000 that will be sealed
[28:22] in the Kingdom but we also know the
[28:24] mystery that we didn't know about until
[28:26] the prophet came to tell us about it
[28:28] call the fifth seal Jew
[28:30] and that field sealed you is Israel that
[28:34] one day will receive
[28:36] eternal life
[28:37] all right so then there's a connection
[28:39] to them but there's a connection to the
[28:43] ride down through the ages of this end
[28:46] time
[28:46] that they're waiting on you and I
[28:50] am all right
[28:51] they're waiting on you and I
[28:54] yeah but here's where we go but I just
[28:58] don't see nothing going on
[29:03] that's the way people talk
[29:05] well we used to have a lot of things a
[29:09] long time ago
[29:10] but everything's kind of died down now
[29:14] and we're just waiting on a bus to pull
[29:16] up
[29:17] right
[29:19] I mean is that what you're doing a time
[29:22] to run out a president to be come out of
[29:24] a woman to be president or a pope to
[29:27] come out of the United States or uh
[29:30] no
[29:31] that's what's been preached 40 50 years
[29:33] ain't it
[29:35] some kind of something that everybody's
[29:36] waiting on
[29:41] you know what I'm waiting on
[29:43] I'm waiting on you
[29:48] and if I die I'll be dependent upon you
[29:52] right
[29:54] to Simply become what the Bible says you
[29:58] are to be
[30:00] to recognize your day in this message
[30:03] all right we take that and we say we
[30:05] recognize our day in this message
[30:06] brought around with the prophet brought
[30:07] around the prophet amen
[30:10] wonderful
[30:11] but what about your message
[30:15] and I've told the church here over and
[30:16] over
[30:17] the Catholic church was never got
[30:19] excited when Martin Luther nailed his
[30:21] thesis to the door
[30:23] he didn't bother them
[30:26] you said well they did no I didn't it
[30:29] was when the people begin to Rally
[30:31] around behind Martin Luther the Catholic
[30:34] Church got excited
[30:38] they wasn't excited because that he was
[30:40] protesting them they'd had protest many
[30:42] before then
[30:47] she's the people right amen
[30:50] when the children of Israel was down in
[30:52] Egypt
[30:56] they were they had to
[31:00] rally around the message of their day
[31:02] yeah the Moses
[31:05] but you know what
[31:07] Moses never took him in the promised
[31:09] land so that evidently wasn't God's full
[31:11] plan
[31:12] Joshua took him in
[31:14] all right so there's more to the story
[31:16] than just waiting on Moses
[31:19] all right
[31:21] then here we are in the end time looking
[31:24] back and seeing that everything before
[31:27] us and everything after us
[31:31] is waiting on you and I
[31:34] well we're not important
[31:37] you know we just don't know who we are
[31:42] all right I've made this statement
[31:44] probably ten times I'll make it one more
[31:45] everybody in the Bible
[31:48] that ever amounted to anything was a
[31:51] people or a person who realized who they
[31:54] were and what they were doing
[31:56] right
[31:59] when they realized when Moses his mama
[32:03] told him who he was he knew for 40 years
[32:06] who he was
[32:10] five minutes at the burning bush sent
[32:13] him back to Egypt to take over
[32:15] why because he realized who he was his
[32:19] mama told him who his was
[32:21] right but that didn't do any good
[32:24] that made him a coward in a running and
[32:26] killing an Egyptian
[32:30] huh
[32:31] for five minutes of the burning bush it
[32:33] sent him back to Egypt to take over
[32:38] which you know Moses wouldn't the one
[32:40] that was to come out of Egypt he could
[32:42] go in and out anytime he desired to
[32:46] it was the children of Israel now here's
[32:48] the words of the Prophet right he said
[32:50] when Israel began to cry out for a
[32:53] deliverer God met that in the person of
[32:57] Moses to bring them out
[32:59] all right
[33:03] so in the end time
[33:05] when the people begin to cry out yes
[33:09] instead of quitting crying like babies
[33:11] oh we don't have nothing when we was
[33:15] back in the old days may I quote brother
[33:17] random
[33:21] I keep this tape in the it's in the
[33:23] church age and I keep it in my truck and
[33:25] play it every time I'm out in a truck
[33:27] brother random says no believer needs to
[33:31] say that if I was back there
[33:37] what he said
[33:40] that's right he said cause he's the same
[33:42] yesterday today and forever
[33:46] all right
[33:48] he's the same so then why cry out oh if
[33:52] we're just back there when the prophet
[33:53] was here
[33:54] did God leave when the prophet left
[34:00] come on church it's not throwing off on
[34:02] anybody's ideas and opinions
[34:04] it's just telling the God's honest truth
[34:10] realizing then that everybody's waiting
[34:12] on you and I am
[34:14] let's just read a couple of quotes
[34:20] let's go with number seven brother I
[34:22] told him I said I'm going to jump so
[34:24] follow me numbers okay that means I left
[34:27] them a number on the side of my notes
[34:29] and they're supposed to put that up on
[34:31] the screen all right from the message
[34:33] what was the Holy Ghost given for
[34:36] preached in
[34:38] 1958-59 excuse me 12 17. look what your
[34:42] Prophet says
[34:43] you read all the way up and down I'll
[34:45] give you the whole quote all right but
[34:47] now when we need it the spirit of God
[34:49] raises a standard what is it he's
[34:52] pouring in his Spirit then those who are
[34:54] resting out yonder in the grave
[34:57] are under the altar of God as the
[34:59] scripture says are crying how long how
[35:02] long how much longer God's waiting on me
[35:05] and you
[35:08] oh
[35:14] he's waiting on me and you
[35:16] the church is waiting on me and you
[35:21] right those in the grave before us are
[35:24] waiting on you and I
[35:26] know right
[35:28] adoption time
[35:30] look when God can pour into us his
[35:33] fullness his power his resurrection that
[35:37] when the church in Christ becomes so
[35:39] close together till Christ becomes
[35:41] visible Among Us and raises the dead and
[35:43] we go into rapture
[35:47] so everything is waiting on you and I
[35:53] now I'm going to be blunt
[35:56] because that way I can't be
[35:57] misunderstood from blood
[36:00] the people of this message are the most
[36:01] laziest shiftless bombs that have ever
[36:04] been in any age
[36:07] because they got their own little
[36:09] concept of what it is and their own
[36:11] little book of rules and her own little
[36:12] set
[36:13] and they're sitting down waiting
[36:19] and a lot of them ain't waiting on
[36:20] brother Brown to raise
[36:24] may I say it without getting offensive a
[36:27] lot I've been waiting on Joe Coleman to
[36:29] raise
[36:34] gonna name a lot more
[36:39] what about it
[36:44] do you understand what I'm saying
[36:47] the people have just sat down and died
[36:49] in the message
[36:52] well ain't no revival going on
[36:56] I've been in a Revival ever since I
[36:58] first heard of this prophet's message
[36:59] and if you can't say that you need to
[37:02] get in the Altar and get born again
[37:06] you mean
[37:07] that you've heard the greatest thing
[37:09] that all the world has been waiting on
[37:11] all those back there everybody down
[37:14] through
[37:15] that's right
[37:17] is waiting and depending upon you
[37:22] you know the Jews will have the
[37:24] Millennium do you know that the prophet
[37:25] said that then the Millennium will be to
[37:27] the Jews right that's when they all come
[37:29] back in and different things happen well
[37:31] you know what they're they're going to
[37:33] be way on pies to it which you know what
[37:35] they're not going to get it unless we
[37:36] get it
[37:37] that's my point that's what I drove at
[37:39] for months and months
[37:41] what is the thing that they never
[37:43] achieved but yet they they achieved all
[37:45] of the great wonderful things in their
[37:47] time they never achieved a change in the
[37:49] body they never achieved eternal life
[37:55] which you and I are going to do it why
[37:57] because the Bible said it
[37:59] all right now I got a choice
[38:02] I can be an us or they yeah
[38:08] right
[38:10] I can say that the world is waiting on
[38:12] us
[38:13] are they waiting on somebody else
[38:18] because that's what Hebrews says
[38:20] so I can change myself and to say well
[38:24] and come on folks now most of you know
[38:26] it I'm playing
[38:27] 40 years ago almost I said the biggest
[38:30] portion of the people of this message
[38:31] will die and go by the grave I will not
[38:35] back off on that statement
[38:37] not because of old age a lot of young
[38:39] people in this message are dying but you
[38:41] know why because if I can't come to a
[38:43] place to be changing among the twinkling
[38:45] of an I I've got to go by the grave and
[38:47] so have you
[38:49] until now it's my choice
[38:54] but we're in a silly day
[38:56] right
[38:58] you know there's nobody in here knows
[39:00] for sure who you are
[39:01] I'm talking about physically
[39:06] come on physically
[39:09] what do you mean
[39:13] I'm Mark action Roth
[39:17] no you might be Mark McGillicuddy
[39:23] come on I'm playing
[39:25] you say but no my Mom and Daddy was pure
[39:27] might have been but you don't know
[39:31] so you don't know who you are
[39:35] so then somebody comes along one day and
[39:37] passes that paperwork
[39:39] and they say look
[39:41] you might not be Wade Dale
[39:43] you might be Jim Jones
[39:48] or George Jones okay
[39:51] we'll put George in there
[39:58] and he'll say I'm 50 something years old
[40:02] and I've been a Dale all these years and
[40:04] I'm going to stay a Dale
[40:06] because I know who I am I'm Samuel
[40:09] weight Dale II
[40:13] okay Mr Dale but said now what we've got
[40:16] is we found some paperwork connected to
[40:19] this
[40:20] Jones
[40:22] that went in George Jones
[40:25] that would entitle you to his
[40:27] inheritance
[40:31] according to that we got about two
[40:33] billion dollars it belongs to ever who
[40:36] this is
[40:40] yeah
[40:42] hands are going up I'm George Jones
[40:50] okay
[40:52] illustration you'll never forget an
[40:54] illustration all right
[40:58] what's my point
[41:01] if you change for two billion dollars
[41:03] from who you really are
[41:07] then you've got a problem
[41:11] you don't know who you are
[41:16] I don't care what they can prove
[41:19] I know who raised me
[41:23] I didn't know my dad he died when I was
[41:25] about four years old but my mom worked
[41:27] on a farm
[41:29] digging and doing and working in raised
[41:32] nine kids
[41:34] and I'm the baby
[41:36] you think 10 billion dollars would make
[41:39] me change my name
[41:41] you are
[41:43] messed up in your brain
[41:48] because love is more than 10 billion
[41:51] dollars
[41:52] I love the one who brought me into the
[41:55] world people today want I want to know
[41:57] who I am
[42:01] I want to find out who I am I might be a
[42:05] Jones
[42:10] you said what's your point my point is
[42:12] one thing
[42:14] those in the Bible that ever amounted to
[42:16] anything was people that knew who they
[42:17] were
[42:19] whether that be old or new testament
[42:21] with people who knew who they were
[42:25] and I knew that the Bible said it is he
[42:27] hath made us and not we ourselves we are
[42:29] his people and sheep of his pastor
[42:31] I know who my father really is
[42:36] how about you
[42:39] see ever since I heard about that when
[42:41] the prophet began to talk about it I
[42:43] told you before I've had experiences
[42:45] I've had things happen but when that
[42:47] Prophet began to talk about a personal
[42:49] relationship between you and God
[42:53] with a real God
[42:56] there was not a man
[42:57] or mythology mythologies are a thought
[43:00] spiritual something
[43:02] that he was a being
[43:04] a person amen amen
[43:09] you see right then I began to say wait
[43:11] just a minute
[43:13] if he's that and I'm supposed to be his
[43:16] child who am I
[43:21] what are you trying to say when the end
[43:23] time people
[43:25] finds out who they are
[43:30] right is that true go to number number
[43:33] five brother
[43:34] we got it somewhere on here
[43:38] okay go to number five
[43:40] which is a revelation of Jesus Christ
[43:42] start taken from the church age book
[43:44] page 15.
[43:46] and watch
[43:48] Satan fights the truth he fights the
[43:50] word the people trying to destroy the
[43:52] people trying to destroy the word
[43:54] if he destroys the word he destroys the
[43:56] people so look what he said he knows
[43:58] that if the people get a true revelation
[43:59] of the true church and what she is and
[44:03] what she stands for and that she can do
[44:06] the Greater Works she will be an
[44:08] invincible Army if they get a true
[44:10] revelation of the two Spirits within the
[44:13] framework of the Christian church and by
[44:15] God's spirit discern and withstand the
[44:19] Antichrist Spirit Satan will be
[44:21] powerless before her
[44:23] just like he was before Jesus Christ
[44:25] believe that
[44:27] or is that just a good quote
[44:29] or of course a lot of people don't
[44:31] believe it cause come out of the church
[44:32] age book
[44:33] you know that Doctrine right
[44:36] all right
[44:37] well look
[44:39] what he says
[44:42] what she stands for
[44:44] and that she can do the greater nobody
[44:47] can do Greater Works it's only him we've
[44:50] got to figure out what's being talked
[44:51] about it's nobody can do Greater Works
[44:55] you know the message you know what the
[44:57] prophet said
[44:58] it means more
[45:00] instead of course nothing can be greater
[45:02] than him Watch what it is what is that
[45:05] that he's talking about down here what
[45:06] is that two spirits
[45:08] that's in the framework of the church
[45:11] one of them's the Holy Spirit watch the
[45:13] other one
[45:15] has to be the devil right because
[45:16] there's only two spirits
[45:19] so the devil's trying his best to
[45:20] discourage you
[45:22] to keep you from realizing who you are
[45:24] to try to in perfect words to you to
[45:27] make you where you won't believe that
[45:28] you can do the Greater Works
[45:33] right
[45:37] but I just don't see nothing going on
[45:40] will open your eyes
[45:44] we have seen the dead raised in this
[45:48] church
[45:53] some are setting here
[45:57] that we're not
[45:58] be here if it hasn't been for that
[46:01] but yeah of course nobody alone well we
[46:03] don't know whatever go ahead that's all
[46:05] right no problem
[46:08] but you know what
[46:10] we just read from what was the Holy
[46:12] Ghost given for
[46:13] he said God's waiting on
[46:16] me and you
[46:18] the church is waiting on
[46:20] me and you
[46:23] look what he says go to number six
[46:25] brother Revelation book of symbols 56 6
[46:29] 17. let's just read this one
[46:34] roll it up a little bit where
[46:37] look what he says keep holding on don't
[46:39] worry
[46:40] God is waiting
[46:46] you mean God is waiting
[46:50] we just read that God was waiting on you
[46:52] and I
[46:53] we just read the churches waiting on you
[46:55] and I what about it God is waiting and
[46:58] trying pressing to get the mystery of
[47:01] God revealed to his church
[47:07] that's what's the holding back the
[47:08] coming of Christ now and the great
[47:10] Millennium is this great Supernatural
[47:13] power that really lays dormant
[47:17] in the church
[47:24] well
[47:26] you mean your star
[47:30] look how simple he makes it go to number
[47:31] eight we have seen his star and have
[47:34] come to worship
[47:35] paragraph 147.
[47:40] and there's a word prophesied for this
[47:42] day
[47:44] God is waiting to find somebody
[47:48] it's not too unusual
[47:51] to that they can be Anointed with the
[47:53] Holy Ghost
[47:55] to prove that Jesus Christ is the same
[47:58] yesterday today and forever and be a
[48:00] Shining Light to Blind the eyes of the
[48:02] unbeliever
[48:04] that blaspheme it won't bring Justice
[48:07] upon them
[48:09] but he said it's not unusual
[48:12] when something is Not Unusual it means
[48:15] that it is simply usual which means that
[48:18] it can be brought into being
[48:22] all right
[48:23] when we believe it
[48:28] so it's based on you and I
[48:33] thank you
[48:34] it's based on what we can believe
[48:37] well brother if we could just find what
[48:39] is for us in the end time okay why don't
[48:41] you read The Prophet's message the whole
[48:43] message is what did he say he said this
[48:45] Prophet would be pointing to the sky
[48:50] now could complete the rest of that
[48:53] to the word born bride
[48:57] yes
[48:58] maybe two a word one right if you're
[49:00] going to be so technical
[49:06] you mean the whole world is waiting on
[49:07] you and I
[49:13] evidently must be
[49:15] go watch it wait no
[49:18] well got to be a president I've got to
[49:20] be a woman president
[49:21] got to be a pope out of the United
[49:22] States
[49:30] those things will happen
[49:32] I believe they can happen and I believe
[49:34] they've already happened
[49:35] oh let's talk about the Moon turning to
[49:37] blood and the blood moons and all this
[49:39] that and the other you know what your
[49:40] Prophet said back in the 50s he said I
[49:42] can show you where that's already took
[49:44] place
[49:46] I don't know that I ever found where he
[49:49] told what it was but he said it did and
[49:51] I believe
[49:52] I believe but don't you because he said
[49:54] it happened
[49:56] I wasn't there when he spoke squirrels
[49:58] into existence but I believe it
[50:00] you know why I believe it because I've
[50:03] seen in my own life God come on the
[50:05] scene
[50:10] the man died right in front of Wade and
[50:12] I
[50:13] his eyes rolled back
[50:15] wait said daddy he's dead
[50:18] I looked down at him I said random
[50:23] he just raised his eyes up looked around
[50:27] I said what
[50:32] you see I've had experiences with that
[50:34] God
[50:36] and I know he's real
[50:39] so that way I can know what he's waiting
[50:42] on he's waiting on somebody
[50:45] that will take the message
[50:50] and coil to the coming of the Lord
[50:53] The Whole World's waiting on it
[50:56] somebody to do it somebody to step out
[51:06] well do you see what they're doing
[51:08] they're waiting on you and I
[51:12] adoption time when God can pour in his
[51:14] fullness Etc it's all in him you know
[51:16] because we don't give no honor to man
[51:17] nowhere
[51:18] I honored the prophet because he brought
[51:20] a message but that was the word he
[51:22] brought is my honor
[51:24] that's what I honor I honor the ministry
[51:27] that brings the word to me I honor that
[51:28] honor the brothers and sisters that are
[51:31] really trying to serve God I honor those
[51:33] things but not people
[51:35] God none of us are worth anything
[51:39] I don't care how glorified You Think You
[51:41] Are
[51:42] you're worth about enough a nickel to
[51:44] sprinkle the hens Nest the prophet said
[51:48] worth a dust
[51:51] but you see when it's all finished
[51:54] it's going to be finished by somebody
[51:56] that believes God
[51:59] well I can't I contend that I believe
[52:01] him
[52:04] well this afternoon we get to it Lord
[52:06] willing we'll find out what's the worst
[52:08] sin of all
[52:09] what's the worst sin you can think of
[52:16] all right
[52:17] but think about it
[52:21] they're waiting on you and I
[52:23] so that means not watch the point we're
[52:25] going to get to the scripture just for a
[52:26] minute and then we'll quit
[52:28] everything before us is dependent upon
[52:31] us
[52:34] everything after us is dependent upon us
[52:38] I know it has been preached and I've
[52:40] heard it I'm not going to argue with
[52:42] nobody about it
[52:43] but I've heard it preached at the Old
[52:45] Testament Saints raised with Jesus
[52:47] Christ and went into immortality now I
[52:50] can't believe that because the Bible
[52:51] says that no man had a personal
[52:53] immortality with Jesus Christ all right
[52:56] I don't believe that all right then that
[52:57] would put not them waiting on us it'd be
[53:00] with us following them somewhere
[53:02] all right and that would put you in a
[53:05] little wrong category all right I
[53:07] believe Those Old Testament Saints are
[53:09] waiting on you and I
[53:11] I believe the bride that has died down
[53:13] through ages is waiting on you and I now
[53:15] let's see if you swallow
[53:17] I believe that the 144 000 that is to
[53:19] come after us is dependent upon whether
[53:22] or not we can achieve what is said here
[53:25] today
[53:27] yeah
[53:28] because if it's not done they won't have
[53:30] anything
[53:32] your Prophet said those two witnesses
[53:35] Church civil right off the back of the
[53:37] seventh seal he said they will tell them
[53:40] about us
[53:43] what do you think they're going to go
[53:44] with to Israel with
[53:47] they're going to go there as living God
[53:50] in them two witnesses and declare that
[53:52] the Gentiles has become what they're
[53:54] supposed to do and when there's 144 000
[53:57] see it that way they cry and pull to
[54:00] themselves because they know they
[54:01] rejected sonship
[54:04] and they know that they'll only be
[54:06] servants is that right to the bride
[54:09] but you know there's a sealed Jew part
[54:11] that goes in there
[54:14] you know there's a group of people
[54:15] calling foolish virgins
[54:19] that will receive it at the white Throne
[54:21] judgment
[54:23] right
[54:24] well you know what if it don't come here
[54:27] and we walk off this Earth in a change
[54:29] of the body there's not going to be
[54:31] anything for them
[54:36] you believe I can prove that with the
[54:37] Bible
[54:39] if I can prove it with the Bible then
[54:40] you'll listen to it
[54:42] of course you get your smirky works and
[54:44] words and things of what you think it is
[54:47] but listen
[54:49] you explain it to me how that anybody
[54:52] else
[54:53] if those Old Testament Saints raised
[54:56] they went into immortality into the
[54:59] presence of almighty God and you show me
[55:01] that in the Bible when wrote around him
[55:04] went beyond a curtain of time he wanted
[55:06] to see Jesus
[55:07] he said he's a step higher
[55:11] nobody can go there
[55:16] right
[55:20] that's immortality
[55:22] Those Old Testament Saints raised into
[55:24] eternity yes I know the quotes of the
[55:26] Prophet I know what he's taught
[55:29] but you don't listen to the other things
[55:30] he taught
[55:32] like he said in the Rapture one day the
[55:34] resurrection Will Come Those Old
[55:36] Testament Saints will come forth
[55:39] and he said we will fall right in line
[55:43] now you're arguing with quotes not me
[55:48] because remember he said falling in line
[55:50] that doesn't mean everything's in order
[55:52] when you say falling in line that means
[55:54] you fall in line where you go you
[55:56] realize when we walk off this Earth the
[55:59] field seals you hasn't got their message
[56:01] yet the 144 000 hasn't got their message
[56:04] yet
[56:06] come on
[56:07] they haven't got it yet
[56:10] so that means as far that away and it's
[56:13] far that away
[56:16] right
[56:18] is dependent
[56:20] upon you and I
[56:22] oh no brother Dale I'm dependent upon
[56:25] Jesus Christ
[56:27] oh I'm glad you're so revelated
[56:30] because that's what I've taught I've
[56:32] preached for 50 years is the Bride of
[56:35] Jesus Christ is God made manifest in
[56:39] another form called a bride
[56:42] Joe and I said that he's waiting on you
[56:44] and I he's waiting on God to manifest
[56:46] himself in you and I
[56:48] to raise the dead he said become visible
[56:51] Among Us
[56:56] right
[56:57] okay Brothers pull up Hebrews
[57:01] 12.
[57:02] 1
[57:04] and we'll take just a minute
[57:06] then I'll back up this evening
[57:09] Hebrews 12 1.
[57:12] wherefore seeing we are compassioned
[57:14] about with so great a cloud Witnesses
[57:17] let us lay aside ever wait the sin that
[57:20] does so easily beset us let us run with
[57:22] patience to race it is set before us
[57:25] looking unto Jesus now we're not looking
[57:27] at anything else come on all right what
[57:29] does that mean we're foreseeing now he
[57:31] finished
[57:34] he finished chapter 12. 11 by saying
[57:38] that they without us could not be made
[57:40] perfect you know the Bible is not
[57:42] written in chapters
[57:46] right we put them in
[57:48] right it would just come right on down
[57:50] through
[57:52] so now look after all of what you see in
[57:55] chapter 11.
[57:56] chapter 12 makes an outstanding
[57:58] statement
[58:00] what
[58:03] wherefore or therefore
[58:05] seeing we also are compassioned about
[58:10] so great a cloud of witnesses
[58:17] compassion about
[58:19] with a great cloud of witnesses
[58:27] we are compassionate about with a great
[58:30] cloud of witnesses
[58:35] everything before us
[58:38] spoke of us
[58:40] no now it's folkat Jesus get that out of
[58:42] your carnal mind
[58:44] and listen sensibly
[58:46] there is no bride without Christ
[58:51] but he without us brother Reynolds said
[58:53] can't be made complete you want that
[58:55] quote
[58:58] you need that quote he said without us
[59:00] he can't be made complete he said to
[59:02] godhead's not complete without us that's
[59:04] a direct quote now or just do what you
[59:05] want to
[59:07] see it's not you and I it's crafting you
[59:10] because it wasn't crying it wasn't Moses
[59:12] it was Christ in Moses right it wasn't
[59:15] Elijah it was Christ in Elijah it was
[59:18] Christ in all of those Old Testament
[59:20] Saints
[59:21] amen right amen
[59:24] it was Christ in Paul it was Christ in
[59:26] all of them coming down through the New
[59:28] Testament
[59:32] so they
[59:33] went without us
[59:35] cannot be made perfect
[59:38] and seeing that point therefore as I
[59:40] said you say wherefore just read You
[59:42] original it says therefore wherefore and
[59:45] therefore interchangeable
[59:51] we're compact with a great
[59:53] cloud of witnesses
[1:00:00] you know my mind runs back to a time
[1:00:02] that
[1:00:04] Elijah was there and
[1:00:06] Emerald gehaza
[1:00:09] he went out and looked one day and man
[1:00:10] they were just syrians there what they
[1:00:12] were they were just everywhere
[1:00:17] and he runs against Elijah he said
[1:00:23] evidently looking for you
[1:00:27] oh Elijah just walked out to her and he
[1:00:29] looks and he said Lord would you open
[1:00:32] the servant's eyes
[1:00:35] now what did he see when he opened his
[1:00:37] eyes
[1:00:40] a great cloud of witnesses
[1:00:43] Chariots of Fire horses of fire rung
[1:00:47] around the prophet right
[1:00:50] you think Elijah was afraid
[1:00:56] I think of another time when it says
[1:00:58] that when you see Jerusalem compassed
[1:01:04] go look your Redemption drawing now is
[1:01:06] that right compassed
[1:01:09] your Redemption drawth now
[1:01:14] if you can't look over there right now
[1:01:15] and take a map and look and see we're
[1:01:17] here Russia's here China's here and all
[1:01:19] these others are over here Jerusalem is
[1:01:21] compassioned about
[1:01:23] on every side
[1:01:25] a little bitty small country bringing
[1:01:28] the whole world
[1:01:30] to a war
[1:01:33] and we're there just as much as they are
[1:01:35] because we need what they got to
[1:01:39] you don't read
[1:01:41] you know that we went into Kuwait why
[1:01:42] did we go into Kuwait when the other
[1:01:44] countries was a problem we went into
[1:01:45] Kuwait you know why
[1:01:47] finally one man printed something one
[1:01:49] day and I started laughing I thought why
[1:01:51] didn't he put that out a whole lot you
[1:01:52] know what he said he said
[1:01:54] he said we went into Kuwait now this is
[1:01:56] an article in a
[1:01:58] newspaper he said because 50 years from
[1:02:00] now we'll need that part of the country
[1:02:02] to bring the oil down through
[1:02:05] so we went to Kuwait
[1:02:09] you mean the towers went down
[1:02:13] that was fulfillment of scriptures right
[1:02:16] and we declared war on Iraq or what it
[1:02:18] is and which one we declared war on and
[1:02:21] all about 90 percent of those people
[1:02:23] that was on those planes that took them
[1:02:25] down come from Syria
[1:02:29] why didn't we declare war on them
[1:02:33] say you don't read
[1:02:35] you're only wanting to know about it
[1:02:37] woman being president maybe it's failing
[1:02:40] maybe it's just maybe it's Clinton
[1:02:44] I always say put both of men together
[1:02:47] and give them double presidency
[1:02:52] if that's going to take the if that's
[1:02:54] what it's going to take to get me and
[1:02:55] you out of here put every woman in the
[1:02:57] White House
[1:03:00] I want to get out of here don't you
[1:03:03] come on folks you can live all you want
[1:03:05] to but some of you are getting old I'm
[1:03:07] 74 and I'm looking down on people that
[1:03:10] are some of them in that age and some
[1:03:12] older
[1:03:12] you know what if something don't happen
[1:03:14] pretty quick unlike brother Carol said
[1:03:16] somebody said something about the you
[1:03:18] know the coming at a certain time he
[1:03:20] said well if he don't hurry up I'm going
[1:03:22] one way or the other
[1:03:23] that's a good point
[1:03:26] either that's going to get me
[1:03:29] there the devil is going to get me or
[1:03:30] something's going to get me
[1:03:34] would you think about
[1:03:36] compassed
[1:03:38] do you know what word Compass means
[1:03:44] it means to
[1:03:47] be hanged
[1:03:51] because you can pass something
[1:03:55] it means to be bound with
[1:03:58] to be compassed with
[1:04:00] be compassed about
[1:04:03] means to lie around you know
[1:04:07] and be compassed with
[1:04:09] have
[1:04:11] round one
[1:04:14] you know
[1:04:18] so if we're compassion with a greater
[1:04:20] cloud of witnesses
[1:04:25] see that's all before us and all after
[1:04:28] us
[1:04:29] I've made clear of what I've said today
[1:04:35] they will be people receive eternal life
[1:04:37] when we get out of here
[1:04:39] but it'll be because that God gave us
[1:04:42] the eternal life and you read Paul in
[1:04:44] there where he's talking about the grace
[1:04:46] that I was talking about the other the
[1:04:48] grace
[1:04:51] if you don't have Grace for somebody
[1:04:53] else then you're not born again forget
[1:04:55] it
[1:05:02] would you die to give this message to
[1:05:04] someone else
[1:05:11] Paul said he would
[1:05:16] compass for about a great cloud of
[1:05:18] witnesses
[1:05:22] all right
[1:05:25] seeing that we're compassioned with such
[1:05:26] a great cloud of witnessing blessed
[1:05:28] unless I'd ever sin and ever since awake
[1:05:32] this is taken from number one brother
[1:05:34] show us the father and it suffice us
[1:05:37] we're running a race now with patients
[1:05:39] looking to the author
[1:05:40] looking back there
[1:05:43] how they was tormented and made fun of
[1:05:45] is called and sought us under and
[1:05:48] wondered about his sheepskin and goat
[1:05:49] skin in deserts and destitute and
[1:05:51] afflicted
[1:05:52] in my
[1:05:54] and the Bible said of whom the world's
[1:05:57] not even worthy of such a people
[1:05:59] all of those
[1:06:01] but they're what
[1:06:04] they're the great cloud of witnesses
[1:06:09] the queen of the South number two
[1:06:11] seeing that we're compassed about the
[1:06:13] greater cloud of witness let us lay
[1:06:14] aside every weight of sin that does so
[1:06:16] easily be set us Hebrews the 12th
[1:06:18] chapter speaking on the speaking of the
[1:06:21] 11th where the great Witnesses was done
[1:06:25] the supernatural was performed and
[1:06:28] Paul's saying see that we're compassed
[1:06:30] with that type of witnesses let us
[1:06:33] leicest side ever sin what what is sin
[1:06:35] unbelief
[1:06:38] what it takes to overcome all unbelief
[1:06:41] our faith all the great Heroes of Faith
[1:06:45] in saying seeing that we're
[1:06:46] compassionate about with such a greater
[1:06:48] cloud of witness let us lay aside ever
[1:06:50] wait and to sin that sin the unbelief
[1:06:52] that does so easily besetters here we
[1:06:55] are tonight right in the shadows of the
[1:06:57] coming of the Son of God and yet we find
[1:07:00] the church in anemic condition
[1:07:06] if you want your Prophet is saying
[1:07:09] we ought to be the great strong Mighty
[1:07:12] Warriors of faith
[1:07:14] that would shake a nation God gives it
[1:07:17] to us
[1:07:19] we would we would just receive it
[1:07:22] so there's little things upon us that
[1:07:25] holds us back from running
[1:07:27] let us let us out all those little ways
[1:07:31] now because we're looking to the author
[1:07:33] and finish of our faith Jesus Christ
[1:07:37] looking to lies for and when we see that
[1:07:39] out to attract the attention it ought to
[1:07:42] attract the attention of every man and
[1:07:44] woman
[1:07:45] to lay aside every little skeptic
[1:07:48] well I love that lay aside ever wait and
[1:07:52] little unbelief that says so easily
[1:07:55] beset us
[1:07:57] some little something come up
[1:08:01] and we say well I never heard that
[1:08:04] before
[1:08:05] search it out in the scriptures
[1:08:08] if it's a Bible
[1:08:10] stay with it
[1:08:12] but I never heard that before
[1:08:16] some little something he says
[1:08:19] we'll pick up that this evening
[1:08:21] but I won't read one more scripture
[1:08:25] I guess they can pick it up I don't
[1:08:26] think I put it in
[1:08:28] Brothers turn over to
[1:08:30] Hebrews 11.
[1:08:32] and we'll start reading in verse 20. 2
[1:08:37] while they're getting there to bring it
[1:08:39] up
[1:08:40] says we're not coming to Mount Sinai
[1:08:43] coming to the mount that might be
[1:08:44] touched
[1:08:45] and that burn with fire nor into
[1:08:48] Blackness and darkness are the trumpets
[1:08:50] of things with Moses watch but we are
[1:08:52] come unto verse 20.
[1:08:58] 20. 2
[1:09:00] 3 excuse me
[1:09:04] let me get it from my reading all right
[1:09:08] but we are come unto Mount sign
[1:09:12] and into the city of the Living God
[1:09:16] the Heavenly Jerusalem
[1:09:18] and to an innumerable company of angels
[1:09:24] you think they was gathered around
[1:09:26] Elijah
[1:09:29] 11 22. I mean 12 22.
[1:09:34] and to the general assembly
[1:09:36] who is that and the Church of the
[1:09:38] firstborn
[1:09:40] which are written in heaven and to God
[1:09:43] to judge of all
[1:09:45] and to the spirits of just men made
[1:09:47] perfect
[1:09:49] and to Jesus the mediator of the New
[1:09:51] Covenant and to the blood of Franklin
[1:09:53] that speaketh better things than that of
[1:09:57] Abel
[1:10:00] sounds like
[1:10:02] that we're gathered by a great cloud of
[1:10:04] witnesses
[1:10:10] you know what now I'm going to finish it
[1:10:12] come on musicians
[1:10:14] by saying it this way
[1:10:17] Those Old Testament Saints attained to
[1:10:20] what God said they would do
[1:10:22] you agree
[1:10:25] the bride down Through the Ages
[1:10:28] under Paul Peter James John
[1:10:31] Luther Wesley Etc even Pentecost they
[1:10:34] attained
[1:10:36] unto the place that God had ordained for
[1:10:38] them to be because the prophet said
[1:10:39] there was a word ordained for every age
[1:10:44] and somebody to make it live
[1:10:49] all right
[1:10:51] then one of these days
[1:10:53] when we get out of here there'll be 144
[1:10:56] 000 Jews except Jesus Christ
[1:10:59] they will be uh fulfilled you
[1:11:04] that your Prophet says will be in the
[1:11:05] millennium
[1:11:07] they will be a foolish virgin given
[1:11:09] eternal life
[1:11:13] and we're compassionate about all of
[1:11:15] those things all before us all after us
[1:11:23] well I never heard it like that because
[1:11:25] I always thought it was dependent upon
[1:11:27] Jesus
[1:11:31] I pray to God you don't misunderstand
[1:11:37] it's all dependent upon Jesus but
[1:11:40] where's Jesus at
[1:11:42] according to your Prophet he's depending
[1:11:44] on us
[1:11:47] of course now that if you don't believe
[1:11:48] it that's what I said maybe you never
[1:11:50] heard the answer you know read that to
[1:11:52] life well I never heard it like that
[1:11:56] I didn't realize that's waiting on us
[1:11:58] well what do you think it is a bus
[1:11:59] pulling up
[1:12:07] what is it folks
[1:12:09] what are you looking for
[1:12:15] if all these doctrines and ideas haven't
[1:12:18] stirreded up enough
[1:12:20] of the 50 years or something that you've
[1:12:22] been around to message some of you
[1:12:24] and you're in bad shape anyway
[1:12:30] but you don't want I don't throw off on
[1:12:32] them men
[1:12:34] I don't throw off on all those doctrines
[1:12:36] just went out you know why
[1:12:38] at least they was moving
[1:12:41] may have been wrong
[1:12:43] but they was moving right
[1:12:47] they were trying
[1:12:49] right
[1:12:52] instead of the Rapture well I'm just
[1:12:54] sitting down here waiting money so I'm
[1:12:56] gonna take place
[1:12:58] and every time a young man jumps up with
[1:13:00] a message people run after him right
[1:13:03] they chase him about the country
[1:13:05] thinking this is the guy
[1:13:07] they're supposed to take us in
[1:13:16] but you know what
[1:13:20] I don't mind saying it I appreciate
[1:13:22] those Brothers
[1:13:23] for at least trying
[1:13:25] may I quote brother Branham
[1:13:33] he said I'd rather see a little wildfire
[1:13:36] than no fire at all
[1:13:40] do you need that quote
[1:13:45] at least you got Wildfire you got
[1:13:47] somebody doing something
[1:13:49] that's right well what do you mean
[1:13:50] brother didn't I go to church when I can
[1:13:55] I'm there when I can
[1:14:00] if you was called on to speak this
[1:14:02] afternoon men women or children and it
[1:14:05] was assigned to you to speak to say
[1:14:07] you'd be here if it took ever doctor in
[1:14:10] the world to put you here
[1:14:14] I'm dirty
[1:14:17] but you tell me that ain't the truth
[1:14:19] and I sit and watch you backsliding
[1:14:23] and who's supposed to tell you
[1:14:27] you mean there's something more
[1:14:28] important than the word of the Lord
[1:14:39] right
[1:14:42] brother sitting right over here
[1:14:45] baby was put on death bed
[1:14:48] Eccleston Hospital
[1:14:52] I'm told that it
[1:14:54] possibly wasn't going to live
[1:14:59] they left the baby at Eccleston Hospital
[1:15:02] and came to the church on Saturday night
[1:15:04] because we was having Bible study
[1:15:10] and that again
[1:15:17] you know what
[1:15:20] you ever thought about that might have
[1:15:22] been what God looked at and reached down
[1:15:25] and touched that little baby and it's
[1:15:27] back there now well and fine
[1:15:34] amen
[1:15:36] all right he's dependent what do we got
[1:15:38] let's stand together one third hope the
[1:15:40] visitors don't misunderstand me I'm
[1:15:42] tough and rough and hard I know that
[1:15:44] but you won't go away saying I don't
[1:15:46] know what he's talking about because at
[1:15:48] least you do know
[1:15:50] what I say it and that's what I mean
[1:15:54] 113 is fine go ahead
[1:15:57] anybody have a name
[1:16:14] just remember in his word how he feeds a
[1:16:20] little bird and take your burden to the
[1:16:25] Lord please and all will turn out to be
[1:16:28] well father in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:16:31] we send this prayer cloth leaving all
[1:16:34] the saints here are dedicated to one
[1:16:36] thing to believing that by your stripes
[1:16:42] you break it manifest in Jesus name
[1:16:46] anybody else
[1:16:59] you know those people achieved
[1:17:03] what God said they would achieve
[1:17:06] you know what that means somebody you
[1:17:09] can achieve the finality of all of this
[1:17:14] and look death in the face and laugh at
[1:17:18] it
[1:17:23] look at them in life
[1:17:30] at least we can stand on his word when
[1:17:33] they told me I had leukemia you know
[1:17:35] what I said
[1:17:38] I said
[1:18:00] so I'm not going to be there
[1:18:03] anything else you can do to help this
[1:18:05] whole body praise God come on
[1:18:09] they can't find out now you just
[1:18:15] oh you ain't been on death's bed yet
[1:18:22] I hope I don't or you wanting me too but
[1:18:27] I certainly don't want you there
[1:18:29] I want us to be changed
[1:18:33] then our little petty feeling
[1:18:39] we'll find out they got left behind
[1:18:44] believe it anybody
[1:19:05] so thank you
[1:19:11] I wrote a little note there last night
[1:19:13] to myself to remember one thing or
[1:19:16] yesterday and I was reading the Bible
[1:19:19] and you know a lot of people would think
[1:19:21] that I've had it said about me you're
[1:19:22] too deep brother Dale you too you
[1:19:24] confuse the people you mentioned at
[1:19:26] least I give you something to think
[1:19:27] about you said we go down here to this
[1:19:29] church and they talk about the love of
[1:19:31] God and they talk about this and they
[1:19:32] yeah and what do they do
[1:19:36] I wrote myself a little note to remember
[1:19:40] the Bible
[1:19:43] is not a book of rules
[1:19:49] now quote the prophet
[1:19:51] it's a revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:19:54] the new birth is him personally to you
[1:19:58] right
[1:20:01] then what we read in the Bible is people
[1:20:04] telling us
[1:20:07] and Paul said I Die daily
[1:20:11] he meant that
[1:20:13] he was wanting to die out to himself
[1:20:18] then the things that are written in the
[1:20:20] Bible are the do's and the don'ts
[1:20:23] as we read it
[1:20:27] it just simply means the Life of Christ
[1:20:29] Living in you and letting him be the
[1:20:32] deuce and the don'ts of your life
[1:20:34] letting him live letting him
[1:20:37] walk and talk and do
[1:20:42] because it's not a book of rules
[1:20:44] rules is never saved nobody
[1:20:48] guess what brother Dale we got to tell
[1:20:50] them they're wrong
[1:20:51] the Bible says the goodness of God
[1:20:53] leadeth us to repentance
[1:20:58] right
[1:21:00] the Bible is not a book of rules it's a
[1:21:02] revelation
[1:21:03] of Jesus Christ
[1:21:06] but didn't carry it on over to what I'm
[1:21:07] talking about it's a revelation the word
[1:21:09] Jesus Christ is now
[1:21:12] is in his bride
[1:21:14] he's not to be here physically right
[1:21:16] we're supposed to meet the Corporal body
[1:21:18] in the air
[1:21:20] but he's supposed to become visible
[1:21:21] Among Us and raise the Dead
[1:21:24] that's pretty strong isn't it
[1:21:27] but not corporal
[1:21:29] not mortal we meet that
[1:21:34] compassion was so great a cloud of
[1:21:36] witnesses
[1:21:40] might changes when death does strike our
[1:21:43] way
[1:21:45] and we can remember
[1:21:48] there's more for us they are for them
[1:21:53] and more on my side
[1:21:56] than there is on the devil's side
[1:21:59] all I got to do is just
[1:22:03] run the race
[1:22:05] and get rid of the sin as we'll cover
[1:22:07] this afternoon that says so easily beset
[1:22:10] you
[1:22:16] what is that sin Lord Jesus we love you
[1:22:20] we thank you we pray that what we've
[1:22:21] said would be worthy and that for our
[1:22:24] lord for you to take it and speak to the
[1:22:27] hearts of the people
[1:22:29] may they see one thing that I'm just
[1:22:31] trying my best to preach Jesus Christ
[1:22:32] him crucified and living in US
[1:22:36] and showing Who We Are
[1:22:38] in your Prophet said he's waiting on us
[1:22:43] to take our stand
[1:22:46] and then he can move
[1:22:50] we love you father and we ask you to
[1:22:52] just bless and God each one now in Jesus
[1:22:54] name
[1:22:55] you dismissed
[1:22:58] the course
[1:23:01] what a day
[1:23:04] that will be
[1:23:06] when my jeans Jesus I shall see
[1:23:11] and I look
