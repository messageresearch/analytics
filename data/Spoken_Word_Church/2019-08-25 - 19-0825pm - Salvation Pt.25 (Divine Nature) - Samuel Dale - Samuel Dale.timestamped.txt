[31:56] and speak to each one of our hearts we
[31:58] love you and we thank you in Jesus name
[32:03] let's go to Ephesians excuse me Peter we
[32:13] can go to Ephesians 1 Ephesians 4 let's
[32:16] go to that one first because it does get
[32:19] the point visions 4 verse 4 or by when
[32:25] you read you may understand my knowledge
[32:27] in the mystery of Christ excuse me
[32:29] through 3rd verse I'm getting all messed
[32:31] up today or there is one body one spirit
[32:35] even as you're called in one hope of
[32:38] your calling one Lord one faith one
[32:42] baptism one God and Father of all who is
[32:46] above all and through all and in you all
[32:48] remember that's the point we're trying
[32:50] to get is one faith one Lord one baptism
[32:55] one faith one thought right all right
[32:59] now let's go to 1st or 2nd Peter 1 Simon
[33:06] Peter serving an apostle of Jesus Christ
[33:07] to them that have obtained like precious
[33:10] faith with us through the righteousness
[33:12] of God and our Savior Jesus Christ grace
[33:16] and peace be multiplied unto you through
[33:18] the knowledge of God and of Jesus our
[33:21] Lord
[33:21] according as his divine power has given
[33:24] unto us all things that pertain unto
[33:27] life and godliness the knowledge of him
[33:30] that have called us to glory in virtue
[33:33] or viral given to us the exceeding great
[33:36] and precious promises now the prophets
[33:38] did these promises that these that by
[33:43] these you might be partakers of the
[33:45] divine nature having escaped the
[33:47] corruption that is in the world through
[33:49] thus you might be seen in the Lord and
[33:52] His blessing to the reading of the word
[34:02] now we want to pick up our thought if we
[34:05] can with that was why was juggling
[34:09] backers board which way to go but I want
[34:12] you to understand first and read we went
[34:14] to Ephesians that there's one faith one
[34:17] Lord one baptism all right all right now
[34:23] then in understanding they can't be many
[34:27] faiths
[34:30] there's only one faith all right now
[34:33] remember our point and emphasis of what
[34:36] we were trying to bring out this morning
[34:39] faith is the substance the is singular
[34:47] it's not faith is a a substance the
[34:50] Prophet said you know a substance that
[34:53] won't work a substance it's not in
[34:57] something you can walk on you can't
[34:59] depend upon it you can have a substance
[35:02] of the basis of what little bits you can
[35:05] think of for the time but it won't hold
[35:07] when the finality is raised up before
[35:10] you so we won't the faith all right now
[35:15] that was the point the faith are as we
[35:18] read in Peter he says with these of like
[35:22] precious faith all right now that light
[35:28] precious faith is the faith that the
[35:31] that Peter said he had it all right now
[35:37] remember that party said he had it okay
[35:43] to them to have obtained like precious
[35:45] faith with Russ through the
[35:48] righteousness no he had that faith he's
[35:52] addressing it to those with that same
[35:56] faith all right now see if you believe
[36:01] that the old doctrine that there is one
[36:03] years ago that we all faced in a way and
[36:06] in
[36:07] that you know there would no holy ghost'
[36:09] doctrine and and the holy ghost wasn't
[36:11] here like it was back under and and
[36:15] everything that i always had was just a
[36:18] confession or an old testament form of
[36:21] salvation and all of those things i
[36:24] didn't agree with it then i certainly
[36:26] don't agree with it now because that
[36:31] would require many face to be able to
[36:35] place one to each one on but we believe
[36:38] in one faith one substance faith is the
[36:42] substance right these seven are a
[36:45] services now faith is the substance of
[36:48] things hoped for all right now what
[36:53] happens is one day you believe it and it
[36:58] can it was we'd be doing fine you know
[37:01] you can believe it but if that ever
[37:04] passes on through into a deeper room
[37:07] it'll come out to be worth it you
[37:09] actually have the substance of it within
[37:13] your possession sister Jeanne lost her
[37:16] her mr. Scoggins she lost her keys to
[37:19] her car
[37:20] well she searched in really I researched
[37:23] and everything and we all prayed and you
[37:26] know ask God to reveal where it was at
[37:28] and and all like that well it just goes
[37:31] on for a while and it wasn't dire but
[37:34] then all that wants one day she goes in
[37:36] and reaches over to another pocketbook
[37:38] car and there's the key that she had
[37:40] changed some things and done some things
[37:42] and had dropped her her keys down in the
[37:45] pocketbook well you know it was there
[37:48] all the time and she knew somewhere that
[37:54] that was because that's what she taught
[37:55] us is God knows and that's why she
[37:57] prayed God you know where my keys are at
[38:00] was he he knew where it was that to him
[38:02] it was a substance but to her it was a
[38:06] confession that a God that can do all
[38:09] things can bring me to act my keys you
[38:11] know and do well you know what but today
[38:14] she has the keys see today it's a
[38:17] substance all right that's the emphases
[38:21] are
[38:21] trying to make this morning of what
[38:24] we're talking about that those of like
[38:27] precious faith and see is reason I know
[38:31] we used to face that doctrine back there
[38:34] didn't believe well you know you just
[38:35] had a you just had something that you
[38:37] know like an Old Testament person you
[38:40] didn't have the new birth and and all
[38:42] like that and you had to wait till you
[38:43] got up to the top of the pyramid before
[38:45] you could say you had the Holy Ghost and
[38:48] a new birth and times well the I
[38:52] couldn't handle that because to me I'm
[38:58] kind of like you know maybe this basis
[39:02] may be stubborn about it but well let me
[39:06] tell you sister Jeannie as an example
[39:07] then I won't be me stubborn one day she
[39:12] had a confession that she believed in
[39:16] the god that had saved her soul she had
[39:23] been a confession and she had to believe
[39:29] in in the God that that she would bleed
[39:31] in and accepted her salvation but yet
[39:36] she didn't have the substance of the
[39:38] keys but the God that was there he knew
[39:43] right where they were at and all that
[39:45] Stu do is wait until we get all out of
[39:47] the way and then it is hands to things
[39:48] to us and you know and all and if we get
[39:51] out of that part to start with that
[39:53] we're trying to make it work instead of
[39:55] just relax and letting him have it these
[39:58] things will work out all right now
[40:00] that's what I mean by faith being a
[40:03] substance it's something that the Bible
[40:09] says things hope for all right the you
[40:16] hoping for something but yet you don't
[40:20] have it to show to somebody else but
[40:25] then you can come into that position
[40:26] have you ever done that to where you
[40:29] know something's right there you know
[40:32] what it is or our situation you
[40:35] you know it you know and there's no
[40:37] argument of anybody can take that away
[40:39] from you because you believe it well yet
[40:42] you don't have something to produce to
[40:44] somebody else I remember years ago see
[40:48] we were supposed to been out of here in
[40:49] 73 and a half you know and all of those
[40:51] things and and along about that time I
[40:57] had a dream of us having a little girl
[41:02] you know maybe some seven or eight years
[41:05] old this was about 1990
[41:08] I mean 1972 somewhere other than our 73
[41:12] it was before the 73 of the half was to
[41:16] come out but yeah I went about told the
[41:19] dream but not only did have a dream of
[41:21] us where the little girl had dreamed
[41:23] with brother Moulton him having a little
[41:25] boy who was ever just about the same
[41:28] size well everybody was laughing at us
[41:32] or at least me because they said well
[41:37] you know 72 or something what I had to
[41:40] dream said the little girl couldn't you
[41:43] ain't you don't miss the rapture because
[41:46] you're gonna you own Pais that 73 of the
[41:49] hive you know you're gonna miss it I
[41:51] said well all I'm doing is what the
[41:54] Bible says the Bible says to tell a
[41:57] dream as a dream all right now that's
[42:00] that's that this tell a dream is a dream
[42:02] so I said all right I'm telling the
[42:04] dream and I saw it well you know it what
[42:09] long term here comes this little girl
[42:10] rolling baby you know and she grows up
[42:12] and no she's sitting back there today
[42:16] well up in the church in Tennessee there
[42:19] there's a little boy by the name of
[42:20] forests that are the most nervous son
[42:24] you know well the thing about it is see
[42:28] I had the substance maybe I didn't go
[42:33] out and tell everybody it's just sayeth
[42:34] the Lord but I had the substance why
[42:37] because I saw it okay whether it was a
[42:41] dream or what I was standing at the
[42:43] house one day and don't I don't know
[42:45] what happened but all at once I looked
[42:48] over it
[42:49] looking out the window - and in Richards
[42:53] houses across the road and I looked over
[42:55] there and I saw Ana I mean Abby
[43:00] so Abby walking through that well look
[43:03] beside of her was this lady walking
[43:06] alongside of her and it was Lisa well I
[43:10] had that better way I don't know
[43:13] but see they had to be a day when that
[43:15] took place because what I saw was a
[43:19] reality well you know they walked a lot
[43:22] of times across her which one was the
[43:23] choice I don't know I ain't concerned
[43:25] about that I'm just telling the story
[43:27] all right see the difference in having a
[43:30] mental concept of something and maybe a
[43:34] dream makes it a stronger concept or
[43:37] taller a vision makes it stronger and
[43:40] stronger each one becomes more and more
[43:44] real to you until eventually you'll walk
[43:48] right into it
[43:49] we'll see to me that's what faith is
[43:52] that's what faith that's the point of
[43:55] faith that you can't show it to somebody
[43:57] else but yet you have it well right you
[44:02] can't show me your new birth no no I
[44:07] don't know come on get the point you
[44:09] can't show me your new birth you see
[44:13] what I can I can show you that I've been
[44:15] a real good person that I don't cut my
[44:18] heart or pants I don't do this out of it
[44:20] we walk right over here to this church
[44:21] and they may be 10 over the earth doing
[44:25] the same thing right yeah it's something
[44:30] that a substance is something when it
[44:33] becomes a reality to you now get this
[44:36] point before we can move on into the
[44:38] next part of the thought when God gives
[44:42] you his own life in the new birth and
[44:48] you know I believe that who always told
[44:49] it because that's what I believe in the
[44:50] beginning I believe the new birth is the
[44:53] birth of the word I believe the
[44:55] disciples took the word as the Bible
[44:57] said and they held it and when it did
[45:01] the Holy Ghost come and fell
[45:02] own it and made that word alive all
[45:05] right
[45:05] I've always told it that way cause this
[45:07] way of always believes it that that is
[45:10] the new birth is the birth the making
[45:12] alive of the word to you just like it
[45:16] would be if you put a grain of corn in
[45:19] the ground and it water comes and things
[45:21] and makes that come alive that's where I
[45:24] believe the new birth is the new birth
[45:26] of that well I I've always believed it
[45:29] that away and always tried to teach it
[45:31] in that form to get you to see you know
[45:34] the the things that I'm talking about
[45:37] all right and by doing that sometimes
[45:40] you know or sometimes you lose people in
[45:45] your thinking because you're thinking of
[45:48] one thing and trying to tell it and
[45:50] others are thinking about faith in
[45:52] another way but just settle down and
[45:54] think about it so that's why I choose to
[45:58] speak this morning that a little bit
[45:59] about there is just one faith there's
[46:04] one Lord there's one baptism now there's
[46:08] many face out there today in the land
[46:12] Baptists Methodists Presbyterians and
[46:15] many many faiths but none of them will
[46:20] line up in the scriptures as being the
[46:22] faith all right so that's what we're
[46:26] trying to find now is the faith the
[46:29] prophet in stature of a perfect man says
[46:31] now the the fact that all of us are
[46:34] searching out the way to find the way to
[46:38] God and the things that he wants us to
[46:40] have all right because that's that's a
[46:43] substance but see we're gonna have to
[46:46] stand here somebody is now why can't we
[46:48] say it's us somebody's gonna stand on
[46:51] the earth one day and say I'm changed
[46:55] but everybody gonna be looking at them
[46:57] and say you ain't yeah well then go see
[47:02] what you're talking about um something's
[47:07] gotta happen what do you think the
[47:10] change is gonna be you know it's got to
[47:13] be the point that somebody has to
[47:16] see it believe it and walk into it
[47:19] because as I said a minute ago now you
[47:21] can't show your new birth because other
[47:25] people can impersonate that just the
[47:28] basis of showing the same thing you're
[47:30] showing or I'm trying to show and not
[47:32] have one bit of Christianity if you read
[47:36] the statue of a perfect man you heard
[47:37] the Prophet say what said a lot of
[47:39] people can have a portion of these
[47:42] virtues and not even be born again right
[47:48] now a lot of people can have a portion
[47:50] of these things and it looks like true
[47:53] Christianity you know somebody in your
[47:55] mind you're thinking now that you can
[47:57] think of of that they are a real good
[48:00] person real sincere real sweet humble
[48:03] and everything and even make us ashamed
[48:06] of our own lives and things you know and
[48:08] know that they're not a believer of the
[48:11] truth right but yet as far as their
[48:15] lives and they're doing it looks good
[48:18] well we'll see that's the confession
[48:21] without a possession that's that part of
[48:26] what I would have said I want to go that
[48:28] we can confess something but if we don't
[48:31] have it within us to see that the way
[48:35] that we need to have it then all we have
[48:37] is a confession but when Christ comes to
[48:41] live in you as Paul said it's not our
[48:44] that liveth but Christ that liveth in me
[48:48] right now that's the faith all right
[48:54] no trying to get that point so now hold
[48:57] that hold that point of what we've got
[48:59] now see then as a we've read he said of
[49:04] like precious faith like precious faith
[49:09] which like means the same right so it's
[49:15] the same faith so then I've always
[49:18] taught it to you everybody that gets the
[49:21] new birth gets it identically the same I
[49:25] know you're not gonna read a lot of
[49:28] people back up for me when I make
[49:29] statement by
[49:30] there I'm talking about the birth I
[49:32] ain't talking about what you've done
[49:34] ever baby is born the same water breaks
[49:40] blood breaks life comes right now this
[49:43] difference is in the way that happen or
[49:45] what breech babies caesareans all kind
[49:49] of thing but even in cesarean baby it's
[49:51] still water blood live come on the ever
[49:56] new birth is the same because that would
[50:01] be you'd be dealing with something
[50:03] different what kind of what could you
[50:05] make it but if you make all of them the
[50:07] same then you don't have to worry about
[50:09] the birth yeah but I just don't see it
[50:13] that way I I said I'm sorry that's
[50:18] that's just mean okay but I'd like to
[50:22] hear you explain it because you see you
[50:25] know yourself you're gonna have to face
[50:27] what I've taught for 40 years that the
[50:30] new birth is a new birth the new birth
[50:34] is the birth of the word the new birth
[50:36] is Christ coming living in you now you
[50:39] gonna make anything else than that
[50:44] because you're still on the basis of
[50:46] what is the new birth I cried I spoke in
[50:48] tongues I shot it had a good feeling
[50:51] you're not listening to what said the
[50:54] new birth is the new birth see then
[50:57] everybody has the new birth the same so
[51:00] then Peter is speaking of them he said
[51:02] them of like precious faith in other
[51:09] words the same kind of faith there's not
[51:12] but one faith there's not many face you
[51:18] want that I've got them laying in the
[51:19] park garden something at home you want a
[51:21] bunch of more bread around talks about
[51:22] like precious faith 26 times and see you
[51:27] can't you can't say hey faith it's D
[51:33] faith it's something that's real to you
[51:38] yet is your new birth you can't explain
[51:41] that to somebody
[51:44] right people look at you and you say
[51:48] well well I'm so happy and I'm rejoicing
[51:52] and having a wonderful time in my
[51:54] salvation and I like at it everything is
[51:56] just so wonderful
[51:57] well it's your right to money I said
[52:02] that one time to a lady I said the Bible
[52:04] said all things work together for the
[52:06] good you know she said how could it work
[52:08] together with what I've got
[52:10] well it couldn't it couldn't work for
[52:14] her in that point because she didn't
[52:16] have what I'm talking about see a
[52:19] Christian should be a Christian it don't
[52:21] make no difference what we enter how and
[52:23] you can only do that through Jesus
[52:26] Christ you can't do that through
[52:27] yourself
[52:29] see we're defeated nobody's a match for
[52:32] the enemy right you said well boy bless
[52:37] God he can't tackle me no he can't Agins
[52:39] already got you if that's what you think
[52:41] he's already holding you all right now
[52:45] faith then being a substance and that
[52:49] substance of your new birth is the same
[52:53] substance that everybody received
[52:57] because everybody's had to birth of the
[52:59] word you know what I'm talking about
[53:00] each age come down no matter what you
[53:03] want to deal with what little bit it was
[53:05] here or what it was over here or quote
[53:07] this over here you know you know it gets
[53:12] silly how people can quote things so
[53:14] wrong but you followed me through now so
[53:20] we'll move on the point I believe ever
[53:22] new birth is the same but some cried
[53:28] some shouted some life some you know
[53:32] many different manifestations came forth
[53:38] that's that's not but the birth is the
[53:41] same uh-huh see because that's what it's
[53:45] saying one faith one Lord one baptism
[53:53] then that way it places it to her we're
[53:56] all the same
[53:57] god it doesn't make a difference of this
[54:01] group over here or that group over there
[54:03] all right so now here's Peter as we get
[54:08] to our point now here's Peter riding in
[54:12] the scriptures and no novice was ever
[54:14] used to write the word right always he
[54:17] never used any of those it would always
[54:19] somebody if you'll check it out except
[54:21] Paul wasn't there be somewhere else but
[54:23] God revealed the word to him when all
[54:27] the rest were used were basically those
[54:29] from the Upper Room experience of the
[54:30] 120 to write the word yeah because the
[54:35] novice is not to write the word no
[54:40] matter how good he can be he still
[54:43] doesn't have that foundation see Peter
[54:46] had something that was real he had a
[54:50] substance faith right he had something
[54:56] that was real okay and what did he want
[55:00] to do now
[55:01] why was he writing to second Peter he
[55:03] gets into first Peter and he talks about
[55:06] you know by being born again I believe
[55:10] in 2nd Peter on 1st Peter in where he
[55:12] talks about being born again and you
[55:13] know nothing all right
[55:15] but he comes to 2nd Peter and now he's
[55:18] writing a letter to these people all
[55:26] right and to tell them now listen to
[55:28] what I'm saying what's he telling them
[55:32] not telling them they need to be born
[55:36] again because he says they have the like
[55:42] precious faith they have the new birth
[55:47] he's telling them how to get where he's
[55:51] at
[55:52] are you listening where's he at we're
[55:56] all born again baby start right here
[55:58] where did Peter name start right here
[56:03] but remember the story I've taught it to
[56:06] you over and over three and a half years
[56:09] before they ever
[56:11] got their experience to be made manifest
[56:15] now you can't argue that point right
[56:19] three and a half years that they
[56:21] followed the Word of God to me that's
[56:24] why it's like that God put it that away
[56:27] to where those people could be anchored
[56:30] in the word and then when the Holy Ghost
[56:32] would fall it would positionally place
[56:35] them to a place to where they would have
[56:38] a greater understanding or be able to be
[56:42] used this said about it they were all
[56:46] there except Paul but Paul goes to the
[56:48] backside of the desert stays back there
[56:50] about fourteen years one time he says
[56:52] three and a half of another and he's
[56:53] talking and when he comes out he's
[56:55] preaching the same thing that Peters
[56:56] preaching right while coach Paul was a
[56:59] prophet he could be taken God took him
[57:02] back there and took him up the plane
[57:06] said no man didn't teach him the Holy
[57:09] Ghost taught him the Peter said well
[57:11] nobody can win no no wait a minute the
[57:14] Lord Jesus taught him all right for
[57:17] three and a half years then he comes to
[57:19] that place so what's Peter doing Peter
[57:21] is going to tell these people how to get
[57:24] where he's at right now as you go down
[57:30] to these kids are graduating and things
[57:33] you know and you go get a job well boy
[57:36] it's nice to walk in and you know that's
[57:39] the way to do today about it you know
[57:40] kids go walking in you know flop down
[57:43] put your feet up on the dish and I said
[57:46] well I want to tell you a little bit
[57:48] about I know all about it I've done read
[57:51] two books done studied all about it what
[57:55] you want me to do mainly go out the door
[57:58] but you wouldn't do that what what
[58:03] happens that you don't get the job why
[58:08] because you think you know something all
[58:11] right and by thanking you knowing
[58:13] something you turn around the shows you
[58:15] don't know it right no I mean I can I
[58:20] can take my shoes off and count to 20
[58:23] but wouldn't it be something to minutes
[58:25] Linna brother do you ret and him telling
[58:28] me to do this that in the other unsafe
[58:30] water you need to do that why I'm gonna
[58:32] do what I'm still alone they come on
[58:35] folks I'm still on the cutting and
[58:37] taping with the computer and that's no
[58:42] joke I don't have them here with me but
[58:43] they're laying in the office all these
[58:46] notes was cut and I don't top it up and
[58:49] get it over here and move it over there
[58:51] and cut in his pace and I cut my own I
[58:53] cut it across and I tape it over there
[58:56] I cut it another one across and I tape
[58:57] it to it I'm still taping and cutting
[59:01] and pasting taping all right see the
[59:06] point that I'm wanting you to see who
[59:09] was Peter talking to he was talking to
[59:16] somebody he says that had the same faith
[59:19] he had now right
[59:24] now he was talking to people that was of
[59:26] like precious faith are the same faith
[59:30] he had now don't get the amount of
[59:33] degree involved into what you're doing
[59:36] because it doesn't work that way you
[59:38] don't want to mean it well he had more
[59:40] this way had more that way he was taught
[59:42] for three and a half years yes he had
[59:43] more natural natural understanding of
[59:47] the kingdoms and the things than they
[59:49] did but here comes the Apostle Paul and
[59:53] what is Peter say he said Paul says
[59:56] things it's hard to be understood that
[59:59] others rational with you know he said in
[1:00:02] other words I don't wrestle with it I
[1:00:03] just kept my mouth shut but I know he
[1:00:06] knows more than I do
[1:00:07] well where to get it he got it from God
[1:00:09] all right now so listen to the points so
[1:00:13] let's read this and unless let's just go
[1:00:16] back and we'll read from where we did
[1:00:18] this morning so go ahead two brothers
[1:00:20] Philip number number one on the stature
[1:00:22] of a perfect man this is start paragraph
[1:00:25] 31 through about 37 or 38 and he's
[1:00:32] bringing the first part of it and what
[1:00:36] he's talking about to me is an amazing
[1:00:38] thing
[1:00:39] because brother branham in teaching the
[1:00:43] message and listen you go back to 99
[1:00:46] I'll say 56 because I don't remember
[1:00:48] that one Intervale in arrest Intervale
[1:00:53] and that brother branham is talking
[1:00:56] about a people that God wants to bring
[1:01:01] to be a living moving instrumentality of
[1:01:05] Christian faith 56 he didn't have to
[1:01:11] wait - come over here - no a lot of
[1:01:12] times he he knew a lot of things but
[1:01:15] look at the thing he didn't catch and
[1:01:18] I'll show it look at what he didn't
[1:01:19] catch okay because this is the way he
[1:01:24] says it so listen let's read it now
[1:01:27] we're approaching the seven seals and
[1:01:29] this is a message on teaching the ties
[1:01:32] of man in that's going to be redeemed by
[1:01:34] the blood of the Lord Jesus and it's
[1:01:36] going to be in that church age that
[1:01:39] eternal church age at the end of the
[1:01:40] seals there we know that we have seven
[1:01:43] trumpets seven plagues vials and so
[1:01:46] forth then we get into as we go along
[1:01:48] well we're waiting for more room and all
[1:01:51] for the people huh I thought this would
[1:01:54] tie in and listen to it I thought this
[1:01:58] would tie in just where I was expecting
[1:02:03] I didn't expect to draw this skeleton
[1:02:08] please draw it out 2nd Peter right add
[1:02:12] to your faith virtue or knowledge to
[1:02:13] everybody that's what he draw it out
[1:02:15] right but he said I didn't expect to
[1:02:18] draw this one because it was not in his
[1:02:20] understanding to use it
[1:02:23] right cuz listen to it I didn't expect
[1:02:27] to draw this skeleton but the other day
[1:02:30] I was with some precious friends of mine
[1:02:33] caucuses down in Kentucky I went down
[1:02:35] thought maybe get in one more dead
[1:02:37] squirrel long before the season closed I
[1:02:39] was up in the woods with my friend
[1:02:42] Charlie standing there and riding in
[1:02:44] brother I didn't even see a squirrel I
[1:02:46] think I scared him away
[1:02:48] when I got to shouting up there in the
[1:02:50] woods this is what come to me
[1:02:53] now watch you boys and sister Nelion
[1:02:58] Margie when I told you I'd tell you
[1:03:00] Sunday when I got to it
[1:03:02] that's what come to me on a message I
[1:03:05] was going to speak on okay now I know
[1:03:10] the rest of it would tie right into it
[1:03:12] now a message he was going to speak on
[1:03:14] he already was speaking it brother
[1:03:17] branham in there that's my point you
[1:03:20] back up to 47 and listen to brother
[1:03:23] branham he's talking about Christianity
[1:03:26] living the life of Christ and the thing
[1:03:29] in a high rim than any anybody you ever
[1:03:33] heard talk about it right because that
[1:03:37] was what caught my attention the years
[1:03:40] of what seventh graders education or
[1:03:42] something guy and he's teaching
[1:03:44] theologians the word and they're sitting
[1:03:51] in amazement listening to him then with
[1:03:54] any common sense course rest of them
[1:03:55] laugh you know and he's in the 40s he's
[1:04:01] teaching things that people never
[1:04:02] thought of he's teaching adoption in the
[1:04:05] 40s and the 50s natural programs at 62
[1:04:12] listen to my point
[1:04:14] he was already had these things in mind
[1:04:17] but yet he didn't have it down and using
[1:04:20] second Peter to be able to put it faith
[1:04:22] virtue knowledge to him right but he
[1:04:24] already knew that that's what he was a
[1:04:25] teaching he was teaching the statute of
[1:04:27] a perfect man back in the 50s and the
[1:04:30] 40's but he didn't bring it down as to
[1:04:33] second Peter and using the chat away you
[1:04:36] said well then what does that mean that
[1:04:37] means a lot to me because as he begin to
[1:04:41] see things and they begin to open up he
[1:04:45] begin to see more on what he was talking
[1:04:48] about more of what he was trying to
[1:04:53] bring out throughout the services that
[1:04:55] he was trying to preach it to the people
[1:04:57] and teaching them and then as he starts
[1:05:00] bringing it out it brought unfolds to
[1:05:03] more and more and more
[1:05:05] all right so that was what he was saying
[1:05:08] he said now I didn't expect to use this
[1:05:11] what said I got this up in the woods one
[1:05:14] time together second Peter well all of
[1:05:18] the things that he had was trying to
[1:05:20] bring out about the life of Jesus Christ
[1:05:23] living in each individual and not being
[1:05:26] that we went to church now come on you
[1:05:29] know what I'm talking about true now
[1:05:31] just don't bulk on me listen you know
[1:05:34] some of you older one especially you
[1:05:36] went into Baptist Methodist Presbyterian
[1:05:38] even Pentecostals and you just set to
[1:05:41] iron your home and you heard sometimes
[1:05:47] you well that's a good point
[1:05:48] but basically you just enduring then you
[1:05:53] tell me I'm wrong on that I'll meet you
[1:05:55] today a judgement but I don't mind
[1:05:58] telling you what I've done I wanted to
[1:06:01] get on with it and tell us something
[1:06:04] good because I read the book that could
[1:06:07] at least read the book my brother was a
[1:06:12] Methodist preacher and then he could
[1:06:15] beat anything around the country as I
[1:06:17] appreciate he had a gift and I try to
[1:06:23] hear him other guys
[1:06:26] although had problems with his Playboy
[1:06:28] magazines that was sitting in his house
[1:06:29] but that was you know I ain't joking his
[1:06:34] kids gave him a this big old thing to
[1:06:37] put his books in one time for Christmas
[1:06:38] ain't tell no joke I'm just saying
[1:06:42] that's the way people was that's the way
[1:06:43] life was back there we went to church we
[1:06:46] just done the best we could do well but
[1:06:53] yet here come a prophet me that's what I
[1:06:58] said this morning when I come into the
[1:07:01] message I didn't say I had to baptism in
[1:07:03] the Holy Ghost when that man started
[1:07:07] talking about the baptism and Holy Ghost
[1:07:08] I knew I didn't have it yet I had seen
[1:07:14] great things take place in my life
[1:07:18] I have seen things happen to her that it
[1:07:22] was marvelous seeing God when I was
[1:07:24] about 11 years old standing in a church
[1:07:26] I can talk about what God done for me
[1:07:30] we yet when I heard that man started
[1:07:32] talking about it
[1:07:34] Christ I began to see Christ in a
[1:07:38] greater realm than I'd ever seen him in
[1:07:40] my life and when I did I realized right
[1:07:43] then I don't have what this man's
[1:07:45] talking about but now sorry but to most
[1:07:51] people when they come into the message
[1:07:53] they just come into the message and say
[1:07:55] I believe run-around was a prophet well
[1:07:59] you better believe I believe he was a
[1:08:00] prophet like I said this morning I've
[1:08:02] read six books and listened to tapes and
[1:08:04] one day you won't try I ain't joking I
[1:08:07] spent my first two or three years in
[1:08:10] this message just locked down on reading
[1:08:13] and studying brother Colley sitting
[1:08:14] there he knows because he had my books
[1:08:16] and things was right there with him and
[1:08:19] I could set her ever night and read what
[1:08:23] you see there was something the man was
[1:08:26] saying about the Holy Spirit that I knew
[1:08:30] I didn't have it because he was talking
[1:08:33] about something personal we was talking
[1:08:36] about we're going to heaven one day
[1:08:37] glory hallelujah were going up to heaven
[1:08:41] and like Wade tells you about you know
[1:08:42] people saying let's ain't that somethin
[1:08:45] today granny is walking on the streets
[1:08:47] of glory she up them down through this
[1:08:49] or they're healed or whatever you know
[1:08:51] you know Oh granny ain't doing that
[1:08:54] ain't puttin her no elsewhere
[1:08:56] that's just a point that that's an old
[1:08:58] way of looking at it like you think
[1:09:00] grandma's up in heaven
[1:09:01] shouting up down through the woods no I
[1:09:04] don't know what she's doing but that's
[1:09:05] that's the point
[1:09:07] but listen now get the point of what I'm
[1:09:11] saying he knows that he has been
[1:09:16] teaching the depth of Christianity and
[1:09:23] trying to get people to see Jesus Christ
[1:09:25] and then he sees the statue of a perfect
[1:09:28] man and it opens up as a way to help
[1:09:31] them
[1:09:32] but we thought we got everything when we
[1:09:34] believed right didn't you then you think
[1:09:37] you've got everything code you want to
[1:09:38] shut the preachers hand I mean did you
[1:09:43] know when you were in the denomination
[1:09:45] I'm asking you did you know you needed
[1:09:47] to study God's Word to get any growth
[1:09:49] development or was you just going to
[1:09:53] church because everybody else went to
[1:09:56] church right then my life was dedicated
[1:10:02] to that my 23 years ago age I was made a
[1:10:06] deacon in a Baptist Church which
[1:10:08] generally didn't make a deacon until you
[1:10:09] at least 45 that's no joke they seen I
[1:10:14] meant that much and they knew it I was
[1:10:16] teaching the adult Sunday School classes
[1:10:18] the Deacons wives and the husband wives
[1:10:21] are what was in those classes and Here I
[1:10:24] am this the young boy they seen that
[1:10:27] that I had a desire I always had a
[1:10:31] desire for God's Word but I couldn't
[1:10:33] find nobody else that had anything there
[1:10:35] wasn't a lot of Pentecostals around us
[1:10:37] one or two in Gainesville at the most
[1:10:39] nowheres else was any thing to go to me
[1:10:43] and we just done the best we could do
[1:10:46] but when brother Branham began to talk
[1:10:48] about not a God up in heaven one of
[1:10:52] these days were going to heaven we're
[1:10:55] gonna go to the happy hunting ground you
[1:10:57] know and we're all and that's why they
[1:10:58] preach like I've told you I've heard him
[1:11:01] preach on the put on the whole armor of
[1:11:04] God
[1:11:04] I've heard that streets meat I don't
[1:11:06] even like to read that scripture because
[1:11:08] I've heard everywhere in the world get
[1:11:10] that armor on and I never didn't know
[1:11:12] what the armor was they didn't either
[1:11:14] ain't joking telling the truth all right
[1:11:18] let's see a prophet when he comes along
[1:11:21] he catches something he catches what
[1:11:24] Peter was doing Peter was talking to
[1:11:29] people that were born again
[1:11:36] that's what he
[1:11:38] said those of like precious faith he was
[1:11:43] talking to people that were born again
[1:11:46] and to try to tell them how to get where
[1:11:49] he was at well is that not what the
[1:11:52] Prophet done when the prophet saw this
[1:11:54] thing is not to not that the point that
[1:11:57] he's trying to even today when you put a
[1:11:59] tape on or whatever isn't he's still not
[1:12:02] trying to get you and me to come to the
[1:12:04] position he was in Jesus Christ to last
[1:12:09] side everything and put it in Christ and
[1:12:11] walk into the word every time I hear a
[1:12:15] tape I hear him still saying that
[1:12:21] because he was trying to teach us how to
[1:12:26] get where he was and that's what I said
[1:12:29] about policy Paul he can't get it from
[1:12:32] Peter then he leaves and goes in the
[1:12:35] desert but he's after I buy several
[1:12:37] guard and God gives it to him and
[1:12:40] brought him out of our world brother
[1:12:41] Brian said they were teaching the same
[1:12:42] thing no faith like precious faith now
[1:12:50] let's go ahead and run it on up to we
[1:12:52] can get to my old subject this morning
[1:12:53] is based on faith so run it on up let's
[1:12:55] get to where we was this morning

[1:13:34] church now the church is them that are

[1:14:31] faith and I'm addressing this to them
[1:14:35] that has obtained the like precious
[1:14:39] faith in other words the same faith he's
[1:14:44] saying I have the faith I have obtained
[1:14:48] this faith and I'm teaching them how to
[1:14:52] take what they've got and a growth

[1:15:07] Jesus
[1:15:07] all right now I emphasize over and over
[1:15:10] this morning I'll do it one more time
[1:15:12] the Bible is not written to a sinner it
[1:15:17] only tells the sinner he's lost it's not
[1:15:21] written to him it's written to those
[1:15:23] that are in Christ Jesus
[1:15:25] it's written to born-again believers
[1:15:27] those born-again believers only one can
[1:15:29] understand remember the scripture this
[1:15:30] morning
[1:15:31] no man can call Jesus the Christ except
[1:15:34] it be why by the Holy Ghost in brother
[1:15:37] Brennan said by the baptism of the Holy
[1:15:40] Ghost is the only way you can know that
[1:15:43] Jesus is the Christ see the only way you
[1:15:45] can have the like precious faith is to
[1:15:49] have the new birth they didn't listen
[1:15:57] it's not to the outside world this is to
[1:16:00] the church see those that are in Christ
[1:16:05] all right
[1:16:07] those that are in Christ now roll it on
[1:16:09] up and we'll try to pick up where we
[1:16:11] were reading from keep on going now pull
[1:16:21] it back down and we'll stop here and
[1:16:22] then we'll our you ago let this soak
[1:16:25] real deep now not preaching this morning

[1:16:32] hope everybody is satisfied with like
[1:16:35] precious faith Peter says I have that
[1:16:38] faith and I'm addressing this to people
[1:16:41] that have that faith and then he's going
[1:16:44] to tell the people how to become where
[1:16:46] he's at in the stature of a perfect man
[1:16:49] and then he goes in add to your faith
[1:16:52] virtue knowledge temperance etc all
[1:16:56] right now watch him watch what he calls
[1:16:58] it that that's so real deep now I'm not
[1:17:01] preaching this morning we're just
[1:17:03] teaching the lesson divine nature let me
[1:17:06] read that fourth verse again so you
[1:17:08] won't miss it
[1:17:09] we're very giveth whereby are given unto
[1:17:10] us exceeding great promises that by
[1:17:13] these these promises we might be
[1:17:15] partakers of the divine nature having
[1:17:17] escaped the corruption that is in the
[1:17:19] world through lust now this person he's
[1:17:22] talking about how is it you can escape
[1:17:26] the corruption that is in the world
[1:17:27] through us how can you escape it the
[1:17:29] only one way to get born again right if
[1:17:34] you're not born again you're not
[1:17:35] escaping the corruption that is in the
[1:17:36] world you're part of the corruption all
[1:17:40] right see the point of what I'm keep
[1:17:42] driving it look having escaped the
[1:17:46] corruption that is in the world see the
[1:17:47] world we've escaped that now he's
[1:17:54] addressing this to the church that's why
[1:18:00] we're here this morning to find out what
[1:18:02] is the way what is God's requirement not
[1:18:05] just a person in here that loves garden
[1:18:07] we you know want to be good and
[1:18:09] everything no but a divine nature okay
[1:18:15] now let's take that from what we were on
[1:18:19] and continue our thought a divine nature
[1:18:27] there's only one one divine there's only
[1:18:30] one nature we have any concern and
[1:18:32] that's the nature of God
[1:18:34] so Peter sees telling them those of like
[1:18:37] precious faith all right now there's
[1:18:44] just one faith then go ahead to number

[1:19:23] he's talking about in red rounds
[1:19:25] explaining to me to tell you you know
[1:19:27] something about guarding things and a
[1:19:29] brother says well that's against my
[1:19:30] faith now what Fred run says what kind
[1:19:35] of faith do you have there's only one
[1:19:41] faith one faith one Lord one baptism
[1:19:45] that right see there's only one faith
[1:19:47] and that's Christian faith that's right
[1:19:51] there aren't no Methodist faith ain't no
[1:19:56] Methodist and Baptist faith and
[1:19:59] Pentecostal faith and Catholic faith
[1:20:01] being different it's just one faith and
[1:20:06] that's faith in the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:20:09] that should be as simple enough for the
[1:20:11] children to understand huh there's only
[1:20:15] one faith so ever born-again believer
[1:20:20] has the same faith are you with me and
[1:20:25] all of that this morning that's sad to
[1:20:27] get say that
[1:20:28] ever born-again believer it's the same
[1:20:31] faith because that's the new birth faith
[1:20:36] is a revelation it's a revelation of
[1:20:38] God's Word and Gudrun says you can't be
[1:20:41] saved without a revelation see then you
[1:20:48] say well what now that's where we get to
[1:20:50] the point I was back in trying to get
[1:20:51] you to see then we said well what kind
[1:20:53] of revelation I need I need a revelation
[1:20:55] of Daniel 7 new weeks or the CEO
[1:20:56] director okay
[1:21:03] sorry but that is what I think brother
[1:21:09] Branham wasn't talking about a
[1:21:10] revelation of the seals is what we're
[1:21:12] getting born again by they hadn't even
[1:21:15] broke in the years and he was teaching
[1:21:17] all these things what's he talking about
[1:21:22] it's a revelation Christ the mystery of
[1:21:25] God revealed what is the new birth
[1:21:29] brother branham he said the revelation
[1:21:31] of Jesus Christ
[1:21:33] personally to you they needn't say
[1:21:37] anything about sealed 70 weeks or
[1:21:39] whatever so get it out of your mind well
[1:21:41] what revelation I need tell me what book
[1:21:42] to read brother Dale where where I can
[1:21:44] can get a great faith dart in Genesis 1
[1:21:50] when you get through the hour start over
[1:21:51] in 47 on the prophets message or being
[1:21:55] alone together you're gonna get a faith
[1:21:57] right at least you'll get something okay
[1:22:01] what kind of a faith there's only one
[1:22:03] faith it's just one faith it's one new
[1:22:11] birth it's one birth of the word now
[1:22:15] listen see that it's not a seals being
[1:22:18] revealed it makes you an uber it's Jesus
[1:22:21] Christ being revealed which is the seals
[1:22:24] the plagues the thunders the vials of
[1:22:26] things being revealed right but it's a
[1:22:30] person being revealed to you not a
[1:22:33] doctor nor an idea or a concept it's a
[1:22:39] revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:22:41] person
[1:22:42] to you he's a person if you ain't never
[1:22:48] seen him like that that's see that was
[1:22:51] what when like I said when the Prophet
[1:22:53] started preaching and I started
[1:22:54] listening then my mind went back to when
[1:23:00] I was 11 years old I heard a man talking
[1:23:04] about the God I saw
[1:23:07] I'm sorry phim I thinks that's the
[1:23:10] exalting whatever I'm just telling like
[1:23:12] it is you do what you want to but I saw
[1:23:15] something back there not a person not a
[1:23:18] I saw an image more and from that day on
[1:23:24] I looked for that person well you know
[1:23:27] where I found that person right where he
[1:23:31] was all the time in the word
[1:23:34] I found him right in the book that I had
[1:23:42] called the Bible and then would I begin
[1:23:47] to grow into that
[1:23:48] that was why I had such a burden to try
[1:23:52] to understand the Bible I wanted to try
[1:23:59] to teach others what little bit I saw
[1:24:00] from it and talk about it
[1:24:04] because it was just something real to me
[1:24:07] it wasn't imagination or a thought and
[1:24:12] see everybody's not made that way come
[1:24:14] on I can quote murder random but run
[1:24:16] said everybody's not made to the basis
[1:24:17] that they see visions or how dreams or
[1:24:19] do you think he said that's this differs
[1:24:21] and individuals it's not made for us all
[1:24:24] but you do have your own experience
[1:24:26] you're supposed to have your experience
[1:24:29] not mine
[1:24:30] don't seek my god seek your God the one
[1:24:35] that's trying to need to talk to you and
[1:24:39] then maybe one day you'd wind up and be
[1:24:42] able to find him the word that you'd
[1:24:44] find him walking right beside of you in
[1:24:47] such a presence until it's beyond all
[1:24:50] things
[1:24:54] variants God walking right side of you
[1:24:59] he never had it it's great thing I've
[1:25:04] turned him in a day and look for it
[1:25:10] turn around keep walking you always kept
[1:25:12] up with me cuz listen Church I'm trying
[1:25:17] to tell you about your new birth I'm not
[1:25:21] talking about some great doctor at least
[1:25:23] you were a pointer whatever
[1:25:25] it's amazing thing when the Prophet
[1:25:27] first said that he said Jesus's first
[1:25:29] doctrine was you must be born again
[1:25:32] and I thought oh God what it is to be
[1:25:36] well look one faith one Lord one baptism
[1:25:42] like I said this morning if you've got
[1:25:44] two souls you've got two gods because
[1:25:47] you'd have to have a soul God for each
[1:25:49] soul if you got two Lords you'd have to
[1:25:55] have two guards because you got then
[1:26:01] that's how simple it is if you
[1:26:03] understand and that will take away
[1:26:05] doctrines from you you have a brother
[1:26:10] Dale I know what the Bible said we'll go
[1:26:11] ahead quote it
[1:26:12] you don't quote it for you the Lord said
[1:26:14] unto my lord
[1:26:20] [Music]
[1:26:22] that'll run said one day Jesus would be
[1:26:25] speaking and another time said the
[1:26:27] father would be speaking that's no
[1:26:28] problem just need to get a revelation
[1:26:33] it's just one come on okay now just one
[1:26:40] faith but Peter now seems to be speaking
[1:26:45] when he speaks of the fact of it being
[1:26:48] the like precious faith and then he he
[1:26:55] pulls up his point and as he brings his
[1:26:57] point up he begins to talk about this
[1:27:00] divine nature this divine nature now
[1:27:10] wouldn't we all want to have a divine
[1:27:12] nature isn't that that not our gold our
[1:27:16] thoughts is to have a divine nature a
[1:27:19] nature of the divine do we want to make
[1:27:26] it some kind of great dish with all we
[1:27:28] see vision as we see this I can't I
[1:27:36] can't talk for vertebrae numbers I'm
[1:27:38] talk for myself what a little bit of
[1:27:40] ministry that God has given me it drove
[1:27:41] me and grey-headed because I know what
[1:27:47] it is and that's why I've tried to
[1:27:49] explain it and that's when you go gray
[1:27:52] head it's trying to explain it to see to
[1:27:56] got to get people to see what you're
[1:27:57] talking about
[1:27:57] look having escaped the corruption of
[1:28:02] the world having escaped that the lust
[1:28:05] and corruption of the world you're above
[1:28:08] that well because you're born again now
[1:28:12] that's now that's the type of person
[1:28:14] that he's talking to the person that has
[1:28:18] escaped these things see the corruption
[1:28:21] of the world he comes up with a divine
[1:28:24] nature I will start on number two they
[1:28:27] don't you pulled up to three but will
[1:28:29] let's read number two which is under
[1:28:34] stature a perfect man
[1:28:36] paragraph 46 45 43 you got to be so in
[1:28:40] love with him until when he you asked
[1:28:42] for something he doesn't give it to us
[1:28:44] that doesn't shake us a bit so you want
[1:28:46] and the only way you can do that is to
[1:28:49] become a partakers of his divine nature
[1:28:52] right then you'll understand the reason
[1:28:56] he can't give it to you particulars of
[1:28:58] his divine nature partaker is part taker
[1:29:02] you know not just taking a part because
[1:29:05] you can't part out God it's per taking
[1:29:08] of his nature within you it's just not a
[1:29:13] part well I got a little bit more than
[1:29:14] you got no that's not the point that's
[1:29:20] you've become to a partaker of his
[1:29:22] divine nature then you'll understand the
[1:29:24] reason he can't give it to you
[1:29:25] protectors of divine nature and look
[1:29:27] here having escaped the corruption that
[1:29:28] is in the world through lust
[1:29:29] that's petered out he's reading it
[1:29:32] escaped it see who it's to
[1:29:35] it's to the church them who are in
[1:29:38] Christ has been exalted above these
[1:29:40] things not he exalted himself but Christ
[1:29:43] brought him up well then that can only
[1:29:46] be talking of a born-again believer how
[1:29:49] could it ever get started that the
[1:29:51] stature of a perfect man that they could
[1:29:54] teach it the way they did back then that
[1:29:55] you don't have nothing
[1:29:58] well one of these days you'll get this
[1:30:00] one day then naturally they're saying
[1:30:02] one of these days I'll tell you you know
[1:30:06] twenty days I'll tell you when you got
[1:30:08] it
[1:30:08] they because that's one of them little
[1:30:11] other words then all right number four
[1:30:17] off the statue of perfect man he says
[1:30:19] Peter is saying here how that we must be
[1:30:22] partakers of his divine nature now each
[1:30:25] one of us are trying to grow into the
[1:30:29] stature of God stature of a perfect man
[1:30:36] that we might be partakers of Christ's
[1:30:39] divine nature these mortal body
[1:30:48] that we could be partakers so well
[1:30:51] that's impossible for us to be partakers
[1:30:54] you don't believe you have the nuber if
[1:30:58] you have the new Burke you have the
[1:31:00] birth you have the the life of Christ
[1:31:04] but then you have within you the very
[1:31:08] life of Christ they keep on going statue
[1:31:14] of a perfect man they can roll them the
[1:31:16] blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us
[1:31:20] changes our nature by sending upon us
[1:31:24] the Holy Spirit that we can become into
[1:31:26] the divine nature of God then we become
[1:31:29] a dwelling place for God I'm down on
[1:31:35] partner still owner controlling your
[1:31:37] your conceptions and making you one with
[1:31:42] him in fellowship and in love and God
[1:31:45] filled you with love he fills you with
[1:31:48] power he fills you with the spirit he
[1:31:52] fills you with his own divine nature he
[1:31:56] changes your carnal nature into his
[1:31:59] nature then you become a new creation a
[1:32:02] divine nature if you're born again today
[1:32:10] then that just gives you a earnest right
[1:32:15] part payment gonna call it but it should
[1:32:18] start you to desiring more of God you
[1:32:24] should desire more of God today than
[1:32:25] ever in your life not be so wait a
[1:32:29] minute or down-and-out it for brother
[1:32:30] Forney says
[1:32:31] wowsie wowsie woo why do all these
[1:32:34] things out and then to me fellowship
[1:32:43] through Redemption so beneath the blood
[1:32:46] and be filled with the Holy Spirit and
[1:32:48] by becoming partakers of the divine not
[1:32:52] a partaker of the church a partaker of
[1:32:55] the divine the divine nature changing
[1:32:58] your own vile nature into a nature that
[1:33:01] loves
[1:33:02] God who believes every word that God has
[1:33:06] said protectors of his divine nature
[1:33:09] what about it approach to God if you
[1:33:16] ever really come to God and got a taste
[1:33:19] of the heavenly gifts of God for takers
[1:33:23] of His divine nature why you could no
[1:33:26] more become a sinner again unbeliever
[1:33:29] than a stalk of corn could become a
[1:33:33] cocklebur his divine nature be partakers
[1:33:42] of his divine nature in that our desire
[1:33:48] to be a Christian and Peter is
[1:33:54] addressing is now see we're using this
[1:33:55] called the next message will pick up
[1:33:57] statute of perfect man we're bread
[1:33:59] around and says now what's the first
[1:34:00] thing we need to do he said we need to
[1:34:02] have faith and be born again you said
[1:34:09] we're writing that you're talking about
[1:34:10] the new boy I'm talking about the new
[1:34:12] what the new birth is when you receive
[1:34:13] it it is the divine nature of Almighty
[1:34:16] God but he puts you to a position to
[1:34:19] start growing it puts you to a baby in
[1:34:22] Christ
[1:34:23] wouldn't be nice to try to think that
[1:34:26] were grownups
[1:34:27] the prophets that we're not growing up
[1:34:31] were just babies right it's a divine
[1:34:38] nature be of those of like precious
[1:34:44] faith in other words Peter was saying I
[1:34:48] have that faith we read it and I'm
[1:34:51] teaching this to people who have that
[1:34:53] same faith now what's he going to teach
[1:34:56] we'll drop right over in verse 7 6 or 7
[1:35:00] and he says and besides this add to your
[1:35:05] faith virtue starts a growth development
[1:35:09] of a Christian to explain it to us of
[1:35:13] what we have need of
[1:35:17] and it's like I've said to you Paul and
[1:35:20] Peter talked the same thing Paul puts it
[1:35:24] more in the adoption on stages because
[1:35:26] he covers it through the Romans and the
[1:35:28] things and the pre destinations and the
[1:35:31] adoptions and things peter is telling us
[1:35:36] how to become that how do we become the
[1:35:40] divine nature of God by yielding to him
[1:35:45] and accepting what he's done for us by
[1:35:50] loving him and wanting to walk so close
[1:35:52] with him until we lose all the other
[1:35:57] things come on church Peter and him
[1:36:01] never done it jesus never taught it
[1:36:03] never the Prophet never taught no
[1:36:06] religion that would take you so beyond
[1:36:08] till you won't even have no remembrance
[1:36:10] or no problems or or no troubles what
[1:36:13] did the Prophet say he said people tell
[1:36:15] you those things so they'll tell you you
[1:36:17] get born again all your troubles to
[1:36:19] solve all your things are over without
[1:36:21] everything if you just give he said
[1:36:22] that's a lie he said that's what when he
[1:36:25] starts that's when the devil gets on you
[1:36:28] is when you start claiming you're born
[1:36:30] again he'll start getting on to you
[1:36:33] trying to make you break down but if we
[1:36:39] can become partakers of his divine
[1:36:41] nature by accepting his word no one more
[1:36:52] last word if faith is the substance of
[1:36:56] things hoped for the evidence of things
[1:36:57] not seen and the new birth is a very
[1:37:00] substance of Almighty God living within
[1:37:02] you then that puts Paul correctly when
[1:37:04] he said is Christ in you that's what he
[1:37:09] said he says Christ in you well that
[1:37:12] should be what we want is Christ in you
[1:37:15] the hope of glory right and then let him
[1:37:19] take care of the things see we get so
[1:37:24] involved in all of the mêlée my house
[1:37:26] and say well water we do
[1:37:28] here if we're the bride we're here
[1:37:34] because you're in that mealy-mouthed
[1:37:35] down-and-out condition so get out of it
[1:37:38] is that straight enough B how many has
[1:37:46] been able to keep the faith now you
[1:37:49] can't say that's one thing you you're
[1:37:51] welcome to the pulpit to get up here and
[1:37:53] say that this man has ever been down and
[1:37:55] out on the word you're welcome to come
[1:37:59] here and tell brother Dale you're down
[1:38:01] and out on no I'm down and out with
[1:38:03] people yeah but not on the word I have
[1:38:07] never had a down and out day on God's
[1:38:09] Word it's God every day and he reveals
[1:38:13] himself when you do that then you can
[1:38:18] just get up in the night and walk
[1:38:19] through the house and say lord I love
[1:38:21] you just come and help us Lord we got to
[1:38:25] get out of here this thing's falling
[1:38:27] apart but you know what I do you know
[1:38:33] what I do mostly I pray one prayer all
[1:38:39] right see Lord you saved my family why
[1:38:45] the kids grandkids great-grandkids know
[1:38:51] I do that cuz he told me one day said
[1:38:55] you'll be there with your offspring now
[1:38:59] you believe what God told me whatever
[1:39:01] that's up to you I don't care won't
[1:39:03] matter to me they ain't gonna change
[1:39:04] nothing he told me said you'll be there
[1:39:07] with your offspring well your kids gonna
[1:39:09] be saved because of your kids I didn't
[1:39:11] say that because Bible saying it and
[1:39:14] putting it to the point that means
[1:39:16] they're going to be more hindered than
[1:39:19] anybody else to try to come to that
[1:39:21] place right so for me to say it is not
[1:39:24] the bragging point is the point of
[1:39:26] second you're gonna get it that's June
[1:39:29] sometime when Wade would come walking
[1:39:33] around I told her I said every time I
[1:39:37] look at him
[1:39:38] I said I just look at him I grin
[1:39:42] I just grant this welcome you know why
[1:39:47] because the Lord doesn't told me he'd be
[1:39:50] there you ever look at it like that you
[1:39:55] ever look at your kids brother right
[1:39:56] when you see them they just all kind of
[1:39:58] go what no they and you look at them and
[1:39:59] say lay it on Lord
[1:40:01] these are daylights out of them well
[1:40:05] bring them to yourself you see that's
[1:40:11] the promise the Lord you made me a
[1:40:14] promise that I'd be there with my
[1:40:17] offspring it's up to you I'm not arguing
[1:40:19] with him I'm reminding them of what he
[1:40:22] said you said it I believe it all right
[1:40:28] no there's another prayer that goes with
[1:40:31] that Lord all these things that are
[1:40:37] taking place you said it was for our
[1:40:41] perfection you promised us that we'd
[1:40:45] have troubles and trials will never form
[1:40:47] but you promised that we'd come out of
[1:40:51] it victorious so I just remind you of
[1:40:55] what you say it I just remind him of
[1:41:00] what he said well we've been doing
[1:41:02] pretty good so far we hadn't just fell
[1:41:04] apart cause all these things everything
[1:41:06] else and the message people fell apart
[1:41:07] we've just been going on we went through
[1:41:10] made it through the seventies we made it
[1:41:11] through the eighties we made it through
[1:41:13] the nineties we made it to the 2000s and
[1:41:15] we're still going still rejoicing and
[1:41:19] saying thank you Lord right call
[1:41:26] musicians take on these things like
[1:41:32] precious faith puts us to a point that
[1:41:35] our desires and thoughts is for a divine
[1:41:37] nature a nature of God to be given to
[1:41:42] each and every one of us do you realize
[1:41:47] what you're praying do you understand
[1:41:49] what I've just explained you realize if
[1:41:52] you prayed
[1:41:56] maybe sometimes the way I do you'd stop
[1:41:58] praying because have you ever prayed for
[1:42:03] trouble to come your way no no no no no
[1:42:07] no no no no
[1:42:08] oh you're not listening hey you're not
[1:42:16] listening to what I'm saying you're
[1:42:20] taking it the wrong way do you think I
[1:42:23] won't in trouble to come
[1:42:24] I don't know I'm the world work I don't
