[9:27] isaiah 53
[9:34] we start with verse
[9:37] one through four
[9:39] it says who hath believed our report
[9:41] and to whom is the arm of the lord
[9:43] revealed but ron said if you believe the
[9:45] report dismayed he said then the word of
[9:48] god
[9:50] has been revealed all right
[9:53] for he shall grow up before him as a
[9:55] tender plant and as a root out of a dry
[9:58] ground he hath no form nor commonness
[10:00] and when we shall see him there is no
[10:02] beauty that we should desire him he is
[10:05] despised and rejected of men a man of
[10:07] sorrows and acquainted with grief
[10:09] and we did and we hid as it were our
[10:12] faces from him
[10:15] he was despised and we esteemed him not
[10:17] surely he hath borne our greece and
[10:19] carried our sorrows yet we did esteem
[10:21] him smith stricken smitten of god
[10:25] and afflicted
[10:27] all right colossians 2
[10:31] begin reading about
[10:32] verse 6.
[10:38] as we
[10:39] as ye have therefore received
[10:42] christ jesus the lord so walk ye in him
[10:46] rooted and built up in him and
[10:48] established in the faith
[10:50] as you have been taught abounding
[10:53] therein with thanksgiving
[10:55] beware lest any man spoil you through
[10:58] philosophy or divine deceit
[11:00] after the traditions of men after the
[11:02] rudiments of the world and not after
[11:04] christ
[11:07] for in him dwelleth all the fullness of
[11:09] the godhead bodily
[11:12] and ye are complete in him now watch
[11:15] that scripture and ye are complete in
[11:17] him
[11:18] which is the head
[11:20] of all
[11:21] principality
[11:23] and
[11:24] power you may be seated lord at his
[11:26] blessing
[11:28] your brother gary will come he has a
[11:29] little testimony he wanted to give and
[11:31] we'll
[11:38] most of you know that
[11:40] they've told me i've had a bad heart
[11:42] from birth it was born defective and not
[11:44] to give you a medical
[11:46] lesson but just to give you some
[11:47] understanding your heart has two bottom
[11:50] chambers in it the left and right
[11:52] ventricle and the jobs of these chambers
[11:55] one of the ventricles is very heavily
[11:57] muscled it's very thick and it pumps
[11:59] blood to the aorta which feeds the
[12:01] entire body so it's a thick muscle
[12:04] chamber to do that
[12:06] the other ventricle is a thin muscle
[12:08] chamber and it's thin muscle because it
[12:11] just pumps blood to the lungs which is a
[12:13] very short trip well the way my heart
[12:15] was made from birth my thick muscle
[12:18] chamber was pumping to the lungs my thin
[12:21] muscle chamber is pumping to the aorta
[12:23] and one of the problems with this is it
[12:25] creates a very high pressure in the
[12:28] pulmonary arteries there and it's
[12:30] something that they're very concerned
[12:31] about and they've watched for years
[12:33] and
[12:34] historically my
[12:37] pressure and it's wears out valves and
[12:39] that creates problems but has been very
[12:42] high and they've watched it over the
[12:44] years through thin weight
[12:46] up weight so body weight hasn't affected
[12:49] it and
[12:51] when uh this week i had gone to
[12:54] have a echocardiogram which i have every
[12:56] couple of years and i told brother dale
[12:59] my wife and brother richard wilson
[13:00] before this i said you know this can't
[13:02] stay it's got to go somewhere why not
[13:05] start now amen well brother brother dale
[13:08] came out wednesday and if y'all remember
[13:10] he said you know you say there's nothing
[13:12] going on among us he said you're the
[13:14] problem and this was you know i was
[13:16] thinking all about this but i went and
[13:18] had the uh the test done
[13:22] and they told me that
[13:25] don't understand it but this pressure
[13:27] has usually been at a hundred which they
[13:29] said was extremely high now man has not
[13:32] been able to do one thing about this
[13:34] they told me said you know uh basically
[13:37] uh you have crested the best part of
[13:40] life and you're on the banana peel side
[13:42] headed towards the brick walls what they
[13:44] told me at emory well my
[13:47] pressure has gone from 100 to 45 which
[13:51] is less than half
[13:52] now that had to be
[13:54] a divine touch from god
[13:56] amen
[14:02] god has touched me many times but the
[14:04] reason that i wanted to to tell the
[14:06] church about this
[14:08] and i don't feel this way every time god
[14:10] heals me but
[14:12] i had an overwhelming sense was this was
[14:14] not just something that god had done to
[14:16] me
[14:17] this is something that god had done
[14:19] among us and the message is he's still
[14:21] god he's still the healer and he is
[14:24] doing things for us and i'm just looking
[14:26] now this is started just let the rest of
[14:29] it fall so i'm very very thankful to god
[14:36] amen i believe it don't you
[14:38] i believe it amen
[14:41] because god is still the healer he's the
[14:44] deliverer
[14:45] he's all in all
[14:47] thank god for medicine we believe in it
[14:50] we go to doctors we do what they can do
[14:52] for us but then we know too that they
[14:55] can't heal us
[14:57] so we don't have to worry about it we
[14:58] just put it all into his hands and
[15:01] and you know
[15:02] make it all to be for his honor and
[15:04] glory and then he'll make things
[15:07] manifest for us right
[15:09] amen so now what we've been trying to do
[15:12] is
[15:13] speaking to
[15:15] uh i told you i was going to take many
[15:17] different avenues
[15:19] in the message of what brother branham
[15:21] had covered
[15:23] our ways or whatever you want to call
[15:25] them i don't have the education to
[15:26] understand it but just the point of what
[15:28] i'm trying to say
[15:30] that i've i've tried in many ways to
[15:33] bring
[15:34] uh to you and i the understanding
[15:37] of
[15:38] that
[15:39] god is
[15:40] real and he's manifesting himself and
[15:43] he's working through his little bride
[15:46] in the end time to bring her to a place
[15:49] that
[15:50] you know
[15:52] uh see we are supposed to be
[15:55] in his stead not instead of
[15:57] now that's that's a different thing
[15:59] that's when you go into that you go into
[16:01] catholicism
[16:02] but we're supposed to be in his stead
[16:04] upon the earth
[16:06] all right and in doing that then
[16:09] we we've tried to make a lot of strong
[16:12] points
[16:13] toward the end time and we'll to keep
[16:15] trying to do today to make more toward
[16:18] that to get us to see
[16:20] what god says about us
[16:22] all right
[16:23] and then see what he says about us
[16:26] uh
[16:27] we we don't have no right to say
[16:29] anything other than that right
[16:31] because that's that's what he's saying
[16:34] and what i've tried to get us to see
[16:37] ever since i've been speaking for the
[16:39] lord over 40 something years
[16:41] is to see one thing
[16:44] god is trying his best to get you and i
[16:47] to realize who we are
[16:50] all right
[16:51] because
[16:52] in doing that then
[16:54] when we recognize who we are take our
[16:56] stand on that point and believe it
[16:59] then he can move on the scene to make
[17:01] manifest
[17:02] the things that he desires and that's
[17:05] the way it's been in every age that's
[17:06] where it's been in all the times uh you
[17:09] know
[17:10] it really was god waiting in the days of
[17:13] moses until moses got the people to
[17:17] believe him well it didn't work too good
[17:19] the first time but
[17:21] sure enough he had to leave and go on
[17:23] and come back but
[17:25] finally the people begin to believe what
[17:28] he was saying
[17:30] you know he was the deliverer the first
[17:32] time but he couldn't do it because he
[17:34] couldn't get them you know they well
[17:36] you're going to kill us like you did
[17:37] them others you know they they thought
[17:39] it was my force that was going to do it
[17:41] when it wasn't that it was going to be
[17:44] god and his way of doing things you know
[17:47] and that's that's what we we've been our
[17:49] best trying to get us to see
[17:51] but i've now do more this afternoon on
[17:54] it probably
[17:56] but i've driven hard on
[17:59] uh you and i to recognize who we are
[18:03] all right
[18:04] and uh see nobody's ever amounted to
[18:06] anything in bible in the bible until
[18:09] they realize who they were
[18:11] moses knew from his mother
[18:14] right
[18:16] that he was to be the deliverer
[18:18] all right
[18:19] but he couldn't do it
[18:21] i mean he just couldn't do it
[18:23] see we can take what people say and we
[18:25] can know a lot of things by reading the
[18:28] bible
[18:29] and believing it that way and that's
[18:31] wonderful
[18:33] but yet see
[18:34] when we begin to realize what the bible
[18:36] is saying about us
[18:40] not about somebody else
[18:42] not about another age or a time or a
[18:45] people or something to come
[18:47] remember what the prophet said the
[18:48] greatest problem was looking forward
[18:51] to something to come looking back
[18:54] to see what had been and not recognizing
[18:56] what's taking place
[18:58] all right i've spent 40 something years
[19:01] you know hollering and screaming at you
[19:03] to try to get you and i to realize who
[19:05] we are
[19:06] the martin luther was a good man and no
[19:09] doubt he had a lot of good thoughts and
[19:12] there was a lot of good people that had
[19:14] protested the catholic church
[19:16] you know in their days and tried to
[19:18] reform the church and the different
[19:21] things you know
[19:22] and uh
[19:24] maybe luther had spent a lot of it
[19:27] i don't think he just all at once wham
[19:29] oh jumps up and becomes a good guy
[19:31] i think god was working on him all
[19:33] through his life
[19:35] preparing him for the time
[19:37] but then one day he saw that scripture
[19:40] and he said the just shall live by faith
[19:43] all right then in that he said in his
[19:46] heart
[19:47] not to
[19:48] he didn't want to get out of the
[19:50] catholic church if you've read his
[19:51] writings about it
[19:53] he wanted to re to reform the church
[19:56] that was why it was called reformation
[19:58] he wanted to get the church back to god
[20:02] all right they put him out of the church
[20:06] and see your prophet in the light stage
[20:07] didn't want to he went everywhere he
[20:09] could go
[20:10] but they put him out
[20:13] it wouldn't wouldn't him you know it's
[20:15] what they done all right
[20:17] but now
[20:18] you think about it
[20:21] to recognize your day in this message
[20:25] now we recognize the prophet to be
[20:26] brought the message he brought to us we
[20:29] thank god for the message we believe the
[20:31] message we read the message we study the
[20:33] message that is our basis all right
[20:37] but when do we think that we're going to
[20:39] become what he said
[20:43] all right but that's what i say in there
[20:44] last sunday
[20:48] we
[20:49] look at things and we're trying to find
[20:52] the problem
[20:55] and naturally we don't want to look in
[20:57] our own
[21:00] cranium cap you know to find the problem
[21:04] we think it's everybody else
[21:07] because we think we're doing pretty good
[21:09] you know well no not not perfect now no
[21:13] but we're doing pretty good but if we
[21:16] could just get everybody else lined up
[21:18] as good as i am
[21:20] well let's
[21:23] that's the problem
[21:25] but see god's not trying to get us now
[21:27] listen the way i say it
[21:31] he's not as concerned in our lives as
[21:33] you and i think
[21:35] we should be concerned with our lives
[21:38] he's concerned with
[21:40] getting us to realize who we are
[21:44] that we're his children we're his
[21:45] offspring
[21:47] then in doing that then he can move on
[21:49] the scene
[21:51] you know
[21:52] what i mean do you uh do when you one of
[21:54] your kids does something wrong you just
[21:56] chunk them out you know get rid of that
[21:58] one no
[22:01] no
[22:04] you don't do it that way well god don't
[22:06] do it that way
[22:08] but you see it's an honest and a
[22:10] contract heart is what he's looking for
[22:13] all right
[22:14] but then we say well don't you believe
[22:16] in living right brother dale no i don't
[22:18] believe in living right
[22:22] oh you're a funny preacher i agree with
[22:24] you
[22:25] i believe in being born again
[22:28] and that let god live the right that's
[22:30] our problems we've tried to live right
[22:33] we've tried to produce a rapture we've
[22:35] tried to do it and it's run off into all
[22:37] kinds of isms and schisms and doctrines
[22:40] of people
[22:43] and we're still here
[22:47] but you see then i'm just trying to get
[22:48] you and i to recognize who we are
[22:52] all right now then i've drove it hard
[22:55] and i'll keep driving it hard because it
[22:57] is the message of the hour
[23:00] to get us to realize but my point is
[23:02] i've been thinking and i'll try to say
[23:05] it in the best words that i can
[23:09] see
[23:10] you might think that i'm talking about
[23:12] only the bride and the end time to be
[23:14] something special
[23:21] we're no different than anybody else
[23:25] we're no different than any age it's
[23:27] ever been
[23:29] we're no different than than luther in
[23:31] his day of
[23:33] drinking beer and sitting in the pub and
[23:35] talking about doctrine
[23:38] oh no we don't do that
[23:42] but what is the difference
[23:46] you see if you'll go back and check it
[23:48] you'll find that he's standing in the
[23:49] midst
[23:50] of the seven golden candlesticks the
[23:52] bible says
[23:55] i know we came through doctrinal ideas
[23:57] of people that you think they didn't
[23:59] plant stuff in your mind
[24:00] and i know where brother branham said it
[24:02] brother and said he's alpha and omega he
[24:04] said he says nothing in between i know
[24:06] that but they don't go to the other one
[24:07] where he says he's out for an amiga and
[24:09] everything in between
[24:12] well are you making that a contradictory
[24:14] thought no
[24:16] it's not that
[24:17] it's just the way he's stating it there
[24:19] is nothing in between alpha nomika
[24:23] he's the same
[24:24] he's the same yesterday today and
[24:26] forever
[24:29] the only difference in the ages was the
[24:31] word
[24:32] had been eaten down you know the spirit
[24:35] was in every age brother around them
[24:36] even preached a
[24:38] point of it the seven spirits you know
[24:41] and said that ain't seven spirits god we
[24:42] know it's not but it's the spirit of god
[24:44] manifested in seven
[24:46] different ways
[24:48] or seven
[24:49] ages or whatever
[24:52] but see it's the same god in each age
[24:56] and like i said if you want to take even
[24:58] the literal part he's standing in the
[25:00] midst of the seven goal again i know
[25:02] what that means i believe that he's he's
[25:04] proud to be in each age but if you want
[25:06] to be naturally carnal
[25:08] then he would be more in the middle of
[25:10] the ages than he would in the end of the
[25:11] ages
[25:13] right because he said he's in the midst
[25:17] and we say missed his middle
[25:20] we'll see we've listened to people
[25:21] explain away that luther didn't know
[25:23] nothing wasn't there now enough
[25:24] pentecost now nothing we got it all
[25:27] i don't believe that now
[25:29] and i'm trying my best and i'll spend
[25:31] more time this afternoon emphasizing
[25:37] that i'm trying to get you an eye to see
[25:39] it's not you and me
[25:45] when we're talking about the seed or the
[25:47] word of god
[25:49] you know
[25:51] i'm not talking about you and i
[25:54] because it's not the person that comes
[25:56] predestinated eternally from god but
[25:58] it's the cedar word
[26:00] the priest person comes free destination
[26:01] by foreign knowledge
[26:04] then he knows where that seed will fall
[26:07] but i'm trying to get you and i to
[26:09] recognize who we are
[26:11] not who luther was wesley was people
[26:13] that's wonderful
[26:15] not even to who brother branham was
[26:17] that's wonderful
[26:18] and without him you and i wouldn't have
[26:21] any ability or any hope whatsoever
[26:24] but you know what that was god's promise
[26:30] you know that brother brown said he
[26:31] would not send a headstone on our merits
[26:38] come on
[26:39] he said he sent it because he promised
[26:40] it
[26:42] did he send the holy ghost on the death
[26:43] pentecost back there
[26:46] because of some great thing they had
[26:47] done
[26:50] no
[26:51] they were probably having a lot of
[26:52] troubles but around just emphasizes that
[26:55] they were talking about well we need to
[26:56] accept it by faith let's get up and go
[26:59] but who was the guys that was talking
[27:00] about that the feller that turned down
[27:02] jesus
[27:03] you know
[27:04] right
[27:06] the peter that
[27:07] denied him right amen
[27:12] but you see church what i'm trying to
[27:13] get you and i to see is
[27:16] we we emphasizing the age and the time
[27:19] because
[27:20] of the word that's being revealed
[27:26] the word that's being revealed is is the
[27:28] main thing and that's why they're
[27:30] dependent upon us
[27:34] to bring them out of the grave
[27:36] because of the word that's being
[27:37] revealed that's a promise of god amen
[27:41] that's not just well we're good people
[27:43] so god sent us a prophet
[27:45] no
[27:46] it's exactly reverse
[27:50] god don't send a prophet to good people
[27:53] now come on give me the bible for it
[28:00] it's when it got bad
[28:02] it was when he sent a prophet
[28:05] it got down to where there was no hopes
[28:07] whatsoever
[28:08] it was down to a stump
[28:10] as the prophet would call it
[28:13] and then we were trying to preach the
[28:15] other day about joy where he said i will
[28:16] restore
[28:18] the years of the crank can't go warm by
[28:20] more him locust caterpillar i'll restore
[28:22] that's promise
[28:24] well he kept his promise he started in
[28:26] martin luther with a just shall live by
[28:29] faith that's why we believe in those
[28:31] churches and the messages they started
[28:33] with
[28:34] but it's when they denominate and die
[28:37] they'll first organize it then they'll
[28:40] denominate it and then it dries up and
[28:42] dies
[28:43] and that's what you see among the people
[28:44] of the message
[28:47] they're organizing everything they can
[28:50] you got to be in our group or you're not
[28:51] in
[28:53] well
[28:54] now we've got to be in
[28:56] christ they kept saying the brother
[28:58] random said should we move to arizona
[29:01] said we got to be in a place he said i
[29:03] got it just now boy you i bet you
[29:05] everybody are we gonna hear it now we
[29:07] we're gonna know where to go
[29:10] he said i'll tell you where to go
[29:13] he said you go to christ jesus
[29:15] that's the place to go
[29:19] he said if you're hunting a place get
[29:21] dire
[29:23] but you see we get it all figured out
[29:27] why has it been 40 years
[29:30] because of our
[29:32] not accepting the deliverance
[29:41] but let's get him accepted let's get to
[29:43] the point but i wanted to just make that
[29:45] amazing i'll bring it a little more this
[29:46] afternoon because i should try to speak
[29:49] on something on dispensations
[29:53] all right and uh but i want you to think
[29:55] about something today
[29:58] and remember now the point that i just
[30:00] made
[30:03] when brother branham speaks of the bride
[30:06] being the fullness of the godhead bodily
[30:09] he's not just speaking of the end time
[30:16] come on
[30:18] he's speaking of the entire bride
[30:23] because the bride is not complete
[30:25] without luther
[30:27] right
[30:28] you know
[30:30] that's an age that's a part you're
[30:32] leaving out some just like i said about
[30:33] the minor prophets
[30:36] you know we think they were not
[30:37] important
[30:40] but they were important to bringing the
[30:42] body of christ
[30:43] into being because if not he would have
[30:46] come into the world with a finger
[30:47] missing
[30:50] or a part off you know right
[30:53] but he doesn't he was complete
[30:55] why because all of those prophets had
[30:57] their part
[30:59] amen the church ages that have tried to
[31:01] cover and it's god coming down
[31:04] to reveal himself that was god in those
[31:07] ages
[31:08] he was pleased to dwell in martin luther
[31:11] when he said that just shall live by
[31:12] faith
[31:16] when the baptists begin to come forth
[31:18] and their move
[31:20] and the predestinations and the
[31:22] restoration of of immersing in baptism
[31:27] he was pleased the dweller
[31:29] that was a move of god
[31:34] see if we leave out any of those things
[31:38] then what have we done
[31:42] we see that's the point because i know
[31:44] that where the devil deals with people
[31:46] because he's the way he deals with me
[31:48] and it's been bearing on me to say make
[31:50] sure you explain it because
[31:53] everybody just think we're building the
[31:55] one great thing that this end time
[31:58] people are a great super duper bunch of
[32:01] people no we're a super dumb bunch of
[32:03] people
[32:08] that's a better word i guess for it
[32:11] prophet said the sickest body
[32:15] do you need that quote
[32:18] that he'd ever seen is the bride of
[32:19] jesus christ was he talking about
[32:21] physical
[32:24] or was he speaking the spiritual also
[32:30] how do you think that man felt to try to
[32:32] bring a message
[32:35] that's only i believe it's future home
[32:37] now they said it
[32:39] billy paul was the one that told it now
[32:40] that's up to him
[32:43] but said brother branham said
[32:45] billy did you catch that or what i said
[32:47] on the future home oh yeah daddy i got
[32:49] he said billy i asked you did you catch
[32:51] it
[32:53] he said i count on my
[32:54] hands how many people understood
[32:58] what i was trying to say
[33:03] what about knowing that
[33:08] yet pouring his heart out trying to
[33:09] preach
[33:14] right
[33:16] you can see what an hour he was living
[33:18] in thank god for the word that he
[33:19] brought to us
[33:21] and he was the only one that could bring
[33:22] it to us and we don't need another
[33:24] messenger to come to straighten that out
[33:27] we need a group of people to become what
[33:29] the man has said
[33:32] right
[33:33] the problem was that in the days of
[33:35] martin luther was what
[33:36] they started out burning down the
[33:39] churches
[33:42] and he told them to quit they said but
[33:44] that's what you said to do
[33:48] see he was strong against the church
[33:50] until they thought we'll just burn the
[33:52] churches
[33:54] he said that wasn't what i was trying to
[33:55] do
[33:59] he was trying to convert to people
[34:03] but you see that's what you take this
[34:04] message and you become so much until
[34:07] most of us remember the days we came
[34:09] into the message
[34:12] and a lot of it was
[34:13] people fighting against organized
[34:15] religion
[34:18] you know denominationalism
[34:21] well that's good
[34:23] but what happened to a lot of them
[34:25] they went back to those denominations
[34:30] or went to nothings
[34:33] right
[34:36] you see the point church that i'm trying
[34:38] to make is it's not to recognize
[34:40] whatever has been thank god for what has
[34:43] been
[34:45] god is wanting you and i to recognize
[34:46] what he's doing right now
[34:52] but not to leave the people out of it
[34:54] what kind of a body would you have built
[34:57] in the new testament if you left out
[34:58] some of the things of the ages
[35:02] you wouldn't have a perfect body
[35:05] that's why the prophet would use it like
[35:08] carriers
[35:12] he said those were carriers luther
[35:14] wesley pinnacle
[35:17] but then he would explain the carrier
[35:19] was the word of the hour for the age
[35:23] they were living
[35:26] right
[35:31] see the way we look at it there's
[35:33] nothing but just us in the end time
[35:36] all right that's the devil taking us
[35:38] over that away too far
[35:41] we've got to remember that even our
[35:43] roots are jewish
[35:46] and we've got to remember the stalk
[35:49] remains
[35:52] the shucks
[35:53] the silks the
[35:55] the thing remain
[35:59] until we
[36:00] come to maturity
[36:05] yeah we want to cut them down get rid of
[36:07] get rid of them
[36:08] denominations
[36:14] but you see in doing that a lot of times
[36:16] we fight so hard until
[36:18] all we've done is just
[36:20] condemn people
[36:24] instead of condemning sin
[36:27] he's that's why i'm not too popular in
[36:28] the message right why because i don't
[36:31] preach about that baptist church over
[36:33] there
[36:35] and i don't preach about that
[36:37] groups up here in that group so with our
[36:38] claim cleaning me i preach to the
[36:40] lulaites
[36:43] you know what
[36:44] the people sitting here anybody else
[36:46] wants to listen that's their business
[36:49] and i'm talking to you and i
[36:52] it's not up to me to pastor the world
[36:57] it's up to me to try to preach the truth
[36:59] to you and i to get you an odyssey
[37:03] but hey folks i look around here and i
[37:06] remember when a lot of you was
[37:07] black-headed
[37:15] and i look around and like i say it's no
[37:17] joke
[37:19] if this thing don't move on pretty fast
[37:21] we're going to be having services in the
[37:22] nursing homes
[37:32] but it's not been god's fault
[37:36] he gave us the word
[37:38] amen
[37:39] but the people don't want to listen to
[37:40] it
[37:43] you know they want their own ideas and
[37:44] their own thoughts and
[37:46] and then you can just read all you want
[37:47] to what brother brown says well okay i
[37:50] got a quote over here i got a quote over
[37:52] here sure
[37:55] we got it in the bible like that
[38:00] but we believe in being baptized named
[38:01] the lord jesus christ with them
[38:03] denominations believe in father son holy
[38:05] ghost
[38:06] no
[38:09] you're making a contradiction in your
[38:11] bible
[38:13] the bible says
[38:14] father son holy ghost it says lord jesus
[38:16] christ it's got to come together
[38:19] to be right
[38:21] right
[38:23] so then that's the way the message of
[38:24] the hour has to come together to build a
[38:26] beautiful picture
[38:30] and in doing that then we come down to
[38:31] see why that he would call people
[38:34] carriers why because they were watch
[38:36] what they were doing
[38:39] they were carrying
[38:42] but the last quote i gave to you brought
[38:43] around and said we're carriers
[38:49] and that's what i tried to get you to
[38:50] see
[38:51] we start off as carriers no matter what
[38:53] you think you started off as
[38:57] i was born in the message you were the
[38:59] carrier
[39:04] we're carriers until
[39:06] that word is brought forth from you and
[39:09] i
[39:10] and then matured
[39:17] right
[39:19] then we're carriers until that time
[39:28] but you just don't think that we're
[39:29] talking about just the end time people
[39:31] as being some i'm talking about the
[39:34] bride of christ
[39:38] that has been through seven church ages
[39:42] and at each age it had been the spirit
[39:44] of god in that age to quicken that word
[39:47] of that age
[39:49] but yet the age itself and the people of
[39:51] that time
[39:54] we couldn't come forth with the full
[39:55] mature word
[40:00] look at even after your prophet stepped
[40:01] on the scene
[40:03] it took him 30-something years he said
[40:05] before he could preach the statue of a
[40:06] perfect man
[40:14] a lot about that restoration maybe we
[40:16] need to get into
[40:18] because a lot of it is re reformation is
[40:21] what we're thinking
[40:24] it's just reforming from a catholic
[40:26] church to a
[40:28] lulayat
[40:31] he says why don't mine talking like that
[40:34] because i'm not against the world
[40:38] i'm not against any of those people
[40:41] i'm against sin
[40:43] and that sin is not drinking gambling
[40:46] smoking running around with
[40:48] that's not supposed to be in here
[40:52] but you know
[40:54] the sin i'm against is the unbelief
[40:59] of you and i
[41:02] all right
[41:04] maybe you'll understand what i'm meaning
[41:05] by
[41:06] see because i've made it so hard i've
[41:08] listened to tape the other day when i
[41:10] wrote around and said that i've made
[41:11] this so hard
[41:13] he said until you think that
[41:15] the others just don't matter he said no
[41:17] that's not what i'm doing and i thought
[41:19] oh god that's what i'm doing i made it
[41:21] so hard to try to drive it in about our
[41:24] age in our time
[41:27] to maybe the people is just
[41:29] not believing those other people had
[41:31] anything
[41:33] but they were the part of the body of
[41:35] christ
[41:38] they were the carriers and they're still
[41:40] there for that purpose
[41:43] as carriers
[41:45] see
[41:46] that's why the devil
[41:48] he'd be after you and i in a hurry if it
[41:51] wasn't for the rest of the religious
[41:53] world system
[41:57] because they're
[41:58] sheltering us
[42:01] why do you want to beat on people so
[42:02] much at your own shelter
[42:04] well i don't want to be trying to know
[42:05] how to organize religious stuff
[42:09] you don't have to be in a denominational
[42:11] church to have a denominational spirit
[42:16] anything contrary to the word of god
[42:18] comes out of organization right
[42:21] that's why i've been trying to get that
[42:22] point but i want you to look at it
[42:27] but remember now what i'm saying when
[42:30] i'm talking about and we'll read here
[42:32] the things the prophet says
[42:36] remember i'm talking about the entire
[42:38] body of christ
[42:40] all the way down through the seven
[42:41] church ages and what they have brought
[42:44] forth
[42:47] to not just be a glorious people up at
[42:49] the top
[42:52] as far as deserving it
[42:54] we don't even deserve to be the bottom
[43:00] right
[43:02] but yeah i was reading you that quote
[43:04] there the other day where he said he
[43:05] puts a believer according to
[43:08] john and on patmos were put right back
[43:10] into the apostles and prophets they're
[43:13] doctrine
[43:16] of what they brought
[43:18] so i believe the bible
[43:21] why because it's
[43:22] god's word
[43:27] but then it's like i told you we we
[43:29] spend our time trying to divide there
[43:31] maybe you didn't understand what i meant
[43:32] when i said it we we we're 25 people and
[43:36] 75 god
[43:39] maybe something the percentage that i
[43:41] gave you one day
[43:42] see we we get to the build-up point we
[43:44] want to be a 90 people and 10 god now
[43:47] just remember we're probably about it's
[43:49] 99 god
[43:51] and probably about 1 people you know
[43:56] and just remember whatever it is is what
[43:58] god's made us
[44:02] it's not our choices even a lot of time
[44:05] it's what he's made us
[44:08] right
[44:09] but now think about it because what i
[44:11] want to think about today is
[44:14] look at the bible
[44:15] through the prophet's message
[44:18] and look at it as
[44:21] seeing that
[44:24] what speaks of him
[44:26] speaks of you and i
[44:31] because when he was hanging there on the
[44:33] cross
[44:34] you remember they put a spear in his
[44:36] side
[44:38] water came out to knowing things
[44:40] you know that was you and i
[44:45] we were part of him
[44:49] well yeah we want to turn the whole
[44:50] thing around you know
[44:52] he came here with us in him but we
[44:54] wanted him to come here with
[44:56] you know we want to be here with without
[44:58] him something but when he came we were
[45:01] in him
[45:05] i want to make it some fancy thing that
[45:07] i'm special
[45:10] i come here with god in me no we come
[45:12] here in him
[45:14] eve was in adam there's no tops no
[45:17] shadows no points
[45:19] of dealing with it
[45:22] and he is the word
[45:24] amen
[45:26] all right when we get on down into the
[45:28] message after a while we have time about
[45:30] the the son of man
[45:32] that will be later on
[45:34] just remember the son of man is the
[45:36] sower of the seed
[45:38] but you know what he is the seed
[45:44] that's why we only believe in one true
[45:45] and living god i tried to explain that
[45:47] through the points of talking to you
[45:49] about it you know that that one seed
[45:51] that's planted comes forth in a multiple
[45:54] form
[45:55] right a bride of christ but then she
[45:57] goes into the ground
[45:59] in a mini-member body yeah but that's
[46:01] still just one seed
[46:03] i hope you followed the point that's
[46:05] still just one seed
[46:07] there's not many many seeds
[46:10] that's gone through the scripture
[46:11] galatians 3 16 said unto thy seed which
[46:14] is christ
[46:16] all honor and glory that i'm trying my
[46:18] best to give is to jesus christ
[46:20] that's all i've ever tried to give
[46:24] is to hold him up
[46:26] and to see what he's talking about
[46:29] what you see
[46:32] when we're reading there in isaiah
[46:35] we'll read in a minute where the prophet
[46:37] says
[46:38] she is smitten
[46:42] she's afflicted
[46:47] that's speaking of you and i yeah
[46:51] see he's outside the church right is
[46:53] that in the book of revelation because
[46:54] he stands at the door knocking
[46:58] well
[46:58] he's welcomed over here and now i'm not
[47:01] pointing over there or anything but
[47:03] he's welcomed in the churches
[47:06] to be god and be the healer and things
[47:08] like that right even to be a savior
[47:10] he's wanted
[47:12] but he's not wanted as lord and master
[47:16] so he's smitten from the church in that
[47:18] form
[47:20] so he's outside the church the bible
[47:21] says knocking at the door trying to get
[47:24] back in well then where are we at
[47:28] we are supposed to be called out of the
[47:30] church
[47:32] all right
[47:34] it's a bride to be called out of a
[47:36] church
[47:38] true
[47:40] well see then the things what i want you
[47:42] to look at today the things that speak
[47:44] of him
[47:45] speak of you and i write in the word
[47:50] because that's what the prophet says
[47:53] in paragraph 2 41 242
[47:56] uh it's the rising of the sun
[48:00] go ahead and pull that up brother
[48:03] same word that speaks to the groom
[48:06] speaks of the bride why because it's all
[48:08] one
[48:09] notice now now notice this quickening
[48:11] power
[48:12] so we bring in the word
[48:14] the mind that was in christ was in you
[48:17] then i'm trying to show you that you
[48:20] when you raised when god raised jesus
[48:22] from the dead he raised up you also
[48:26] and also quickened to life with him
[48:28] you are now quickened to life although
[48:31] then you were but an attribute in his
[48:33] thoughts
[48:34] back there but god had saw
[48:37] all in him
[48:39] at the finish
[48:40] all in him now what's that
[48:43] when god looked down upon the body the
[48:45] spirit left him in the garden of
[48:47] gethsemane he had to die that doesn't
[48:49] mean the spirit left him
[48:51] i have to stop and express because when
[48:53] you read that see you
[48:55] people's mind
[48:56] what happened to him
[49:00] if the spirit had left him like this the
[49:02] word spirit is used
[49:05] then he would have been dead
[49:08] that's plain sense
[49:10] so that's not what he's talking about
[49:14] he's not talking about his body spirit
[49:16] soul but his spirit left him in the
[49:17] garden
[49:19] now if he is he's dead now come on
[49:23] but what's he saying look what he's
[49:24] talking about
[49:26] and the spirit left him in the garden
[49:28] of gethsemane he had to die a man
[49:31] remember friends he didn't have to do
[49:33] that that was god god anointed that
[49:36] flesh which was human flesh and he
[49:39] didn't
[49:40] if he'd have went up there as god
[49:43] he'd have never died that kind of death
[49:46] can't kill god but he didn't have to do
[49:48] it what did he do the anointing
[49:52] we preached on this for 40 years
[49:55] the anointing the prophet said left him
[49:57] in the garden of gethsemane
[50:01] not his natural spirit
[50:04] the anointing
[50:06] that came on him on the river jordan
[50:10] left him in the garden in gethsemane
[50:13] well because he couldn't die with that
[50:14] anointing
[50:16] you know the thing i love about it is
[50:18] we're supposed to be that anointing
[50:21] and you know that's the reason we can't
[50:22] die
[50:23] somebody's going to become so anointed
[50:26] with that anointing of god until they
[50:28] can't die
[50:32] but just remember luther didn't die
[50:36] he went to sleep
[50:40] those people back down through there
[50:41] they didn't die either
[50:43] they went to sleep
[50:46] but you see the anointing is supposed to
[50:48] come back in the entire that's the
[50:50] difference in us and the rest of the
[50:51] people
[50:54] just to come to be an anointing on a
[50:55] bride
[50:57] right because all of it's him anyway
[51:01] but why can't we believe it all right
[51:03] but remember he went there with you in
[51:05] him see
[51:07] god had never been separated the bride
[51:09] from the groom
[51:10] yet
[51:11] so when god looked down upon the body of
[51:14] christ
[51:15] he saw a body
[51:17] he saw both male and female
[51:23] he saw both male and female
[51:27] it was all redeemed in that one body see
[51:30] they are one sign same with word the
[51:32] same word spoke of the groom speaks of
[51:36] the bride
[51:38] now what's he talking about male and
[51:40] female
[51:46] when adam was standing in the garden was
[51:48] there a female there no
[51:52] she had not come into being yet
[51:55] it was in adam in adam in what form
[52:06] when the bride of christ
[52:09] was in christ
[52:10] he looked at it as male and female
[52:13] but not looking at it as two different
[52:15] people
[52:18] because it was just one god
[52:21] if we're another person you're back to
[52:23] trinitarianism again
[52:27] you better consider that
[52:29] see if we're not him made manifest
[52:31] you're in the trinitarianism
[52:37] right
[52:38] you've gone back to your old thinking
[52:41] trying to figure it out there's got to
[52:42] be two
[52:44] no there's not two
[52:47] there's just one true and living god
[52:51] and that's what i've tried my best to
[52:52] get you to see the other day with it he
[52:54] don't need a body on earth now
[52:56] why because he's got a body
[52:59] his body is his people
[53:01] we are his body
[53:03] he's the head
[53:04] that's why we meet him in the air he
[53:07] doesn't come back here physically
[53:10] we meet him in the air
[53:13] all right
[53:14] but think about it now
[53:18] she is him
[53:20] made manifest
[53:25] it's not you and i right
[53:29] we're just the vessels that's right that
[53:32] he's living in
[53:35] all right
[53:36] he was anointed with the fullness of the
[53:39] godhead bodily
[53:42] and when we get to that more and
[53:44] probably this afternoon just remember
[53:47] no one of us
[53:49] can be that
[53:54] no one person
[53:57] of a human being outside of jesus christ
[53:59] can speak about being the fullness of
[54:01] the godhead bodily
[54:03] john on patmos
[54:05] could represent
[54:07] the
[54:08] bride being taken up yeah
[54:13] but that was only a representation
[54:18] but see he's the one true and living god
[54:21] and what we are
[54:22] he has made us
[54:27] so
[54:28] what speaks to the bride
[54:30] speaks of the groom what speaks of the
[54:33] groom speaks of the bride
[54:37] over in revelations i don't read
[54:39] revelation about 20 21 21 22
[54:43] and how beautiful everything is there
[54:46] i read how beautiful he is
[54:49] because even john can't define the
[54:52] difference
[54:54] he sees the city coming down describes
[54:56] the people he sees the people describe
[54:58] the city
[55:00] why because they're the same source
[55:04] if we're another source remember that
[55:06] was what happened at nicaea
[55:10] there in 325 they were arguing over
[55:12] where jesus was almighty god or whether
[55:15] he was a like substance
[55:20] another source
[55:23] alike substance some like you know
[55:27] and even that now i see the first one
[55:29] they didn't come up that he was a
[55:31] different source read your nicey and
[55:33] recreed
[55:35] that he was the source of god
[55:39] but then later on it turned out to be
[55:41] that they believed him to be
[55:43] a different source
[55:45] that's what anthonies and everyone what
[55:47] his name and our hair is anthonyus two
[55:49] guys was arguing over where jesus was
[55:51] almighty god or whether he was
[55:55] a god in a flesh
[55:57] a demon of god as they later developed
[55:59] the words to to being
[56:03] but you see what i'm talking about
[56:08] a compound
[56:11] revelation
[56:15] that's what i'm talking about pull that
[56:17] one up let's read it
[56:19] look what he says about this day this
[56:20] scripture is fulfilled
[56:22] 65
[56:25] paragraph 56-58
[56:27] he said history always repeats itself
[56:30] and scripture has a compound meaning to
[56:33] it
[56:34] and a compound revelation
[56:37] okay he explains it right for instance
[56:39] like it says in the bible that out of
[56:41] egypt i've called my son referring to
[56:43] jesus run the margin on that and you'll
[56:45] find out that also refer find out
[56:49] referred all also referred to jacob
[56:52] same scripture jesus was the greater son
[56:54] jacob was the son that he called out of
[56:56] egypt all right
[56:59] double answer
[57:00] compound meaning
[57:03] all right
[57:05] compound meaning
[57:07] what speaks of the bridegroom
[57:09] speaks to the bride
[57:13] so we can go through the scriptures and
[57:15] see the things that speaks of him
[57:19] and then see what he has done
[57:22] by him giving his life to you and i it
[57:25] makes
[57:26] god manifest in flesh
[57:33] you remember that a few weeks ago
[57:35] where the prophet of god said the light
[57:37] of the age
[57:41] the light of the age is the word made
[57:43] manifest
[57:46] you realize what he's saying martin
[57:48] luther as much as we would throw off on
[57:50] him and his wife
[57:51] he was the light of that age
[57:57] why because he was a born-again
[57:59] christian
[58:02] and he brought a message and people went
[58:04] out and protested the catholic church
[58:09] and all of your writings your great
[58:11] things come from a lot in there and then
[58:13] pick it up with wesley to be able to
[58:14] pick up a little father
[58:17] west and then brought into the
[58:18] songwriting forums and things
[58:23] you've got your white fields and all the
[58:25] different ones that came through there
[58:26] that were trying to get the bible down
[58:29] into our language
[58:34] and thank god for them
[58:37] the printing press developed and we were
[58:39] able to start printing and things
[58:44] but you see
[58:45] the light of each age is that word made
[58:48] flesh
[58:51] and i just don't see it
[58:55] well you wouldn't have seen if you're
[58:56] standing back and see him to be the word
[58:57] in the flesh
[59:00] come on
[59:01] oh yes i believed it back there
[59:05] now do you need the quotes from the
[59:07] prophet
[59:09] he said whatever we are now
[59:12] we would have been then do you need that
[59:17] you see we deny the word made flesh in
[59:19] the last days then
[59:24] you denied back there
[59:28] but you see that's what we don't want we
[59:29] don't want somebody
[59:31] making it so strong until we have to
[59:33] make some decision
[59:39] we want to believe what we want to
[59:40] believe
[59:44] okay
[59:45] help yourself
[59:49] well i thought the bride didn't want to
[59:50] believe what she wanted to believe i
[59:52] thought she was giving up all of her
[59:53] beliefs and ideas and her ways to
[59:56] believe god's word
[1:00:00] that's why you hear me say a lot of
[1:00:01] times when i'm quoting brother branham
[1:00:02] or scripture you know i didn't write the
[1:00:03] book
[1:00:07] you know
[1:00:08] when the bible says he's just one true
[1:00:09] and living god i didn't write that god
[1:00:11] did you're not arguing with me about it
[1:00:16] you're arguing with the word of god
[1:00:21] well we got it figured yeah that's what
[1:00:23] it is we had it figured out
[1:00:26] what are you following me what i'm
[1:00:28] talking about
[1:00:30] compound meaning
[1:00:32] compound revelation
[1:00:35] the revelation that speaks of him
[1:00:38] speaks of her
[1:00:40] because where did we come from
[1:00:47] do you understand that we've got to be a
[1:00:49] part of him the prophet says
[1:00:51] who is the word
[1:00:55] and that's where i'm not throwing off on
[1:00:57] people to do
[1:00:58] but
[1:01:00] i mean you just heard the message
[1:01:03] and you're just now beginning to believe
[1:01:04] that message well you know the part
[1:01:06] you're really believing and what god has
[1:01:08] revealed to you is just as great as the
[1:01:11] greatest ones among us that's been in
[1:01:13] the message 40 years and can quote
[1:01:16] everything the prophet says
[1:01:18] that's the way god looks at it
[1:01:24] there's no big eyes a little use
[1:01:28] you know
[1:01:31] it's what he has made us
[1:01:38] it's what he has made us
[1:01:41] is the most important thing
[1:01:44] now he chose this last day
[1:01:46] people
[1:01:50] and like i've always told you
[1:01:53] you know i mean i've heard this
[1:01:54] statement
[1:01:56] that in the military they used to you
[1:01:58] know because i'd like another day tell
[1:01:59] him
[1:02:00] and my wife was talking a little bit
[1:02:01] nannies
[1:02:02] was talking about the militaries and
[1:02:05] things right now you know
[1:02:07] what if you took away all this
[1:02:08] electronical stuff from the military
[1:02:10] today
[1:02:14] you know just to take away the
[1:02:15] electronical stuff away from it
[1:02:17] and you give them a gun and they had to
[1:02:18] go fight
[1:02:21] i'm going to go
[1:02:22] help me up this hill
[1:02:24] i can't crawl up there
[1:02:28] wouldn't it be that anyway
[1:02:31] i wouldn't want this military backing me
[1:02:33] up without all the sophisticated stuff
[1:02:36] that's right
[1:02:43] because the whole military is not
[1:02:45] special forces
[1:02:48] fat slobs
[1:02:51] and then now they put the women in with
[1:02:52] them
[1:02:54] right
[1:02:55] and i'm not saying anything against that
[1:02:57] i'm just telling the truth but any
[1:02:59] something
[1:03:00] all you gotta do is turn it right loose
[1:03:04] and all i went and i started to pull up
[1:03:06] i pulled up a dress right now
[1:03:08] all the way to hey
[1:03:12] the old saying is oh you're a man or a
[1:03:14] mouse i'm evidently a man
[1:03:16] because my wife is afraid of mice
[1:03:20] i don't mean that as a joke i mean it's
[1:03:22] the truth
[1:03:24] but you understand what i mean
[1:03:27] why is it ladies you can be tough as a
[1:03:30] shoe leather and and you know you can
[1:03:33] i mean you can just tackle them kids you
[1:03:34] can take them just whoop them just and
[1:03:36] then all at once a rat runs through the
[1:03:38] house
[1:03:44] i'm trying to illustrate what the
[1:03:45] military would be like
[1:03:48] right
[1:03:51] but you see church
[1:03:54] have we become
[1:03:56] fat and lazy in the message
[1:04:01] you know
[1:04:04] do we think we got it all figured out
[1:04:05] and you know all about it
[1:04:10] take the computer away
[1:04:12] and a lot of people can't quote brother
[1:04:14] branham
[1:04:22] but just get back to the point
[1:04:24] compound meaning
[1:04:27] even a compound revelation
[1:04:32] as i said then it's
[1:04:34] one it's 90 percent god trying to reveal
[1:04:36] himself to you and i and one percent of
[1:04:38] you and i
[1:04:40] that can believe that part or try to
[1:04:42] manifest that part
[1:04:46] because it's all him anyway
[1:04:49] you know he don't need us
[1:04:52] right boy most people are he can't do
[1:04:55] without me well
[1:04:57] brother brown says stick your finger in
[1:04:59] a glass of water pull it out and you'll
[1:05:01] find out how important you are with god
[1:05:04] good illustration right
[1:05:09] but yet he chose us
[1:05:14] and he chose this end time people to be
[1:05:16] something to where they could believe it
[1:05:20] we could believe that what's speaking of
[1:05:21] him is speaking of us
[1:05:26] and we can see that he was the way he is
[1:05:28] smitten from the church
[1:05:30] is in you and i
[1:05:34] right
[1:05:35] well i don't have to explain that do i
[1:05:40] the people love us
[1:05:43] but they don't want the words you have
[1:05:47] they don't want the clothes you wear the
[1:05:49] the life you try to live
[1:05:54] they don't want that
[1:05:57] they want to do everything they can to
[1:05:59] try to
[1:06:01] talk you out of the word
[1:06:04] right
[1:06:07] well that really don't mean that now
[1:06:10] now do you think that that you're the
[1:06:12] only people that's going to heaven
[1:06:16] how many of that you heard
[1:06:18] you know
[1:06:19] we're good people aren't we well i agree
[1:06:26] but just remember
[1:06:29] my favorite quote is this
[1:06:34] remember you're looking in a mirror
[1:06:36] you're not trying to find yourself
[1:06:40] you're only going to see something
[1:06:41] getting older and fat and ugly
[1:06:45] right and you can go how the face lifts
[1:06:48] and the twists and the pulls and it
[1:06:50] ain't going to change not one thing in
[1:06:52] the world
[1:06:54] right
[1:06:56] well
[1:06:57] a good pain on a barn is better than an
[1:07:00] old barn that's a good favorite one
[1:07:03] but that's not true
[1:07:10] but listen church
[1:07:13] compound meaning
[1:07:16] read the scripture about him and think
[1:07:18] about yourself
[1:07:25] think about your life compared to
[1:07:29] what he was
[1:07:32] because see i i had that problem when i
[1:07:34] was in the baptist church i've told you
[1:07:36] many times about it i couldn't
[1:07:38] understand i could read the bible
[1:07:40] and my problem is i couldn't understand
[1:07:43] i couldn't understand how come people
[1:07:45] would kill him when he never done
[1:07:46] nothing but good
[1:07:51] that bothered me
[1:07:53] 50 years ago or more
[1:07:56] that i couldn't understand
[1:07:59] i mean the man doing good healing the
[1:08:00] sick feeding the people doing everything
[1:08:03] in the world
[1:08:06] yet they wanted to kill him
[1:08:10] why
[1:08:14] and just remember
[1:08:16] it will repeat or it has been repeating
[1:08:19] down through time because it's always
[1:08:21] been the church that's persecuting the
[1:08:23] people right
[1:08:25] do i need to get you the quote where the
[1:08:26] prophet said the ones who started out as
[1:08:28] being persecuted wound up being the
[1:08:30] persecutors
[1:08:33] is it not in the history that the
[1:08:35] catholic church killed
[1:08:37] 68 million of their own records they
[1:08:39] have
[1:08:46] but see we we're still lovey-dovey with
[1:08:49] them you know
[1:08:54] well that was way back under
[1:08:57] we're different now yep
[1:09:01] we're same old people but thinking about
[1:09:04] it look what your prophet has to say
[1:09:07] about the little bride if you read it on
[1:09:09] masterpiece let's get this one we'll try
[1:09:11] to at least cover this part
[1:09:12] look at number three brother
[1:09:16] who's back her brother
[1:09:17] anderson's out brother bob back there
[1:09:19] again
[1:09:20] whoever is running the
[1:09:23] that side
[1:09:25] this is taken from the masterpiece
[1:09:27] paragraph 159 through 161.
[1:09:31] he's talking about how the malachod
[1:09:33] forced to bring back back to the
[1:09:34] original
[1:09:36] look she is smitten from the church
[1:09:40] from the church body
[1:09:42] smitten with her master
[1:09:45] you remember that
[1:09:46] for the same purpose
[1:09:49] what
[1:09:51] she is the word
[1:09:54] just the same as joseph was smitten from
[1:09:56] his brethren because he was the word
[1:10:00] and jesus was smitten from his brother
[1:10:02] and because he was the word the church
[1:10:04] is smitten the bride is smitten from the
[1:10:06] church because she is the word there is
[1:10:09] your stages again one two three just
[1:10:11] exactly
[1:10:14] he's outside the church
[1:10:17] smitten she's smitten as we read in
[1:10:20] isaiah
[1:10:23] what's speaking of him is speaking of
[1:10:25] you
[1:10:29] are you not trying to get people to see
[1:10:32] the word yes
[1:10:34] you know are are you not trying to get
[1:10:36] people born again yes
[1:10:38] it's not that the whole goal of the
[1:10:40] christian life
[1:10:42] is to try to get people saved
[1:10:44] well you know that was his goal
[1:10:50] but because of doing it
[1:10:52] then he was rejected and so is she
[1:10:56] right
[1:10:57] as joseph was
[1:10:59] see she's the word you know what they
[1:11:01] say about lula ah that's just old word
[1:11:03] word word word that's all they do about
[1:11:05] a little word word word
[1:11:06] well what else is this supposed to be
[1:11:10] i i didn't know it was to be anything
[1:11:13] else to me that's a great compliment
[1:11:19] especially when they can't come and show
[1:11:20] you where you're off the word
[1:11:28] boy you better believe they'd love to
[1:11:31] and you let this old boy pass off the
[1:11:33] scene they'll come at you whenever
[1:11:35] attack they can
[1:11:39] i understand that because i know what's
[1:11:41] going on in it
[1:11:43] they're afraid of the word
[1:11:48] they'll go talk about you in the back
[1:11:49] you know
[1:11:50] they don't face in the word
[1:11:52] okay come on let's just sit down right
[1:11:53] here and talk it over
[1:11:56] i don't been 240 years with this folks i
[1:11:58] don't have to worry about it that's not
[1:12:00] bragging it's just true
[1:12:07] listen
[1:12:09] the word living and in action
[1:12:11] well i just don't see it going on i
[1:12:13] don't i don't see anything i just we're
[1:12:16] just a bunch of people that just we just
[1:12:18] go to church and try to be good well
[1:12:20] that's probably 99 true
[1:12:24] but there's one percent somewhere that
[1:12:26] that's not true about
[1:12:28] you know and i'm trying my best to be
[1:12:30] one of them i hope you are
[1:12:33] right
[1:12:35] see the word living and inaction
[1:12:38] that said there last week but if we if
[1:12:40] if you've got what you think you what is
[1:12:42] not signs and wonders because of your
[1:12:44] unbelief
[1:12:47] and i'm not meaning their unbelief out
[1:12:49] there i'm talking about the unbelief in
[1:12:50] here
[1:12:52] right
[1:12:55] because see what they are out there you
[1:12:57] let the word come in here and let it be
[1:12:59] revealed and out there know how to do it
[1:13:02] you mean it bothers you brother dale
[1:13:04] because the people don't
[1:13:07] want you to come and preach in their
[1:13:08] churches
[1:13:12] that did years ago many years ago
[1:13:14] because i wanted to get god's word to
[1:13:17] him but you know what don't bother me
[1:13:19] now
[1:13:20] you know why
[1:13:23] because i realize if it's anything it
[1:13:25] hadn't been me anyway
[1:13:29] i realized that
[1:13:30] well see then i know who's outside the
[1:13:32] church
[1:13:35] right
[1:13:36] come on
[1:13:37] but look the word living in an action
[1:13:39] the bible bride
[1:13:41] the bible right
[1:13:43] not some man-made bride the bible bride
[1:13:45] smitten and afflicted of god
[1:13:48] no beauty we should desire her
[1:13:52] but yet we did esteem her smitten and
[1:13:55] afflicted of god
[1:13:58] well they should have put him in there
[1:14:00] you know well that's all right with me
[1:14:02] go ahead and race it out and put him in
[1:14:03] there because him is her
[1:14:08] or hers him so all right
[1:14:11] that's right she stands alone she is
[1:14:14] smitten from all denominations
[1:14:19] now that means in the message
[1:14:25] is he making denominations just
[1:14:28] something prior to this
[1:14:32] okay
[1:14:34] she's smitten from all denominations
[1:14:36] according to revelation 3.
[1:14:39] she's smitten out of the lady you'll see
[1:14:41] an age that she was raised up in see
[1:14:44] this church is was raised up in the
[1:14:46] ladies in church age that's the huss
[1:14:49] but if them others went can't you
[1:14:51] pentecostal men man see that
[1:14:54] if that other was husk and died if that
[1:14:57] other stalk had to die if the tassel had
[1:15:00] to die so much the hust die there's
[1:15:03] three stages of organization
[1:15:08] see
[1:15:11] what is it
[1:15:13] she
[1:15:15] is smitten
[1:15:18] so when you read the bible
[1:15:22] just read of the people
[1:15:25] that he's talking about
[1:15:29] who was it
[1:15:31] in the book of acts
[1:15:33] that they were turning down
[1:15:40] wasn't the disciples
[1:15:43] it was the god of the disciples
[1:15:47] it was god and the people
[1:15:49] who did they turn down in martin
[1:15:51] luther's day
[1:15:55] who did they turn down in the baptist
[1:15:56] day
[1:15:57] the methodist day
[1:15:59] the presbyterians
[1:16:01] you say you can call them names why that
[1:16:04] denominations brother dale
[1:16:08] well where did you come from
[1:16:14] right
[1:16:17] all of us come out of some of them
[1:16:19] things
[1:16:23] and then if we didn't we're just a
[1:16:24] one-man denomination anyway so that
[1:16:26] don't matter
[1:16:29] but do you see what i'm driving out
[1:16:35] god
[1:16:37] is made manifest in his people it's not
[1:16:40] the people worth anything
[1:16:45] where it talks about during the gospel
[1:16:46] you know the seeded went forth to sow
[1:16:48] the seed and the seed fell here in the
[1:16:50] cellar
[1:16:53] i thought that he was given a parable
[1:16:56] of the bride of christ
[1:17:02] no he's talking about
[1:17:04] what was he just talking about jesus
[1:17:05] only
[1:17:11] see
[1:17:14] he said well why are you talking so much
[1:17:16] on this
[1:17:17] to lay a foundation for us to even talk
[1:17:19] about
[1:17:20] the bride could be the fullness of the
[1:17:22] godhead bodily
[1:17:25] because we take the wrong approach on
[1:17:26] that
[1:17:28] it ain't correct
[1:17:31] but the right approach is
[1:17:32] that we're nothing
[1:17:37] we've never been anything
[1:17:41] but it's what he has made us
[1:17:45] he shows us to be what we are why can't
[1:17:48] we accept that
[1:17:52] but instead we try to figure it out try
[1:17:54] to go through the lines of of you know
[1:17:57] well i just don't see nothing going on
[1:18:11] pull that back up on the masterpiece and
[1:18:13] look down on paragraph 164.
[1:18:19] remember the masterpiece yes
[1:18:23] you remember what we read up
[1:18:24] here now look what he says
[1:18:28] stands alone like the bridegroom
[1:18:31] rejected of man despised and rejected of
[1:18:34] the churches
[1:18:37] the bride stands that way
[1:18:40] what is it it's his masterpiece see the
[1:18:43] word that he can work through
[1:18:46] make manifests rejecting
[1:18:49] so the stalk the ties on the hust never
[1:18:51] becomes seed
[1:18:52] no we're all the time becoming more like
[1:18:56] the seed
[1:18:57] now at the harvest time the seed is back
[1:19:00] to original to its original life
[1:19:03] back to the bible malachi 4 said it
[1:19:05] would be brought back
[1:19:07] that way oh my
[1:19:09] must have all
[1:19:14] what is it
[1:19:21] what speaks of the groom speaks to the
[1:19:23] bride
[1:19:27] read the bible
[1:19:28] in that form
[1:19:32] and just remember
[1:19:34] that the bible is a books and names
[1:19:39] now the one you've got in front of you
[1:19:40] is a record of human mankind upon earth
[1:19:44] called the bible
[1:19:46] but the original book of life is just
[1:19:48] the book of names
[1:19:51] but when that name came on earth
[1:19:54] and became manifest in continuance psalm
[1:19:57] 139 when my members fashioned when it
[1:20:00] yet not perfect
[1:20:04] in continuance
[1:20:06] the body of christ has been built down
[1:20:08] to seven church ages
[1:20:10] and all of that body of christ is there
[1:20:12] and when we read this afternoon about
[1:20:15] the bride being the fullness of the
[1:20:16] godhead bodily i hope i don't have to
[1:20:19] spend three hours explaining he ain't
[1:20:21] talking about just us
[1:20:25] he's talking about the bride
[1:20:29] down through seven church ages
[1:20:32] the specific part for our day is to
[1:20:35] recognize
[1:20:38] who we are
[1:20:40] for this age
[1:20:42] and recognize that the bible is speaking
[1:20:45] about
[1:20:46] you and i yes
[1:20:51] you remember the
[1:20:53] who is it the ethiopian eunuch is that
[1:20:55] the one is the man speaking of himself
[1:20:58] or another
[1:21:06] why can't we realize the bible is
[1:21:07] speaking about you and i
[1:21:11] compound meaning compound revelation
[1:21:16] the meaning is is to try to
[1:21:19] bring his bride into view now how let's
[1:21:22] let's see if we can quote
[1:21:24] that
[1:21:24] isn't it something like this that
[1:21:29] he took my place
[1:21:33] right
[1:21:35] why
[1:21:37] so that i might
[1:21:38] be able to take his place
[1:21:43] is that derogatory to him to
[1:21:46] think about you and i as
[1:21:49] something and no he's the one trying to
[1:21:52] make us manifest
[1:21:58] he's the one that's
[1:22:01] trying his best to reveal the bride of
[1:22:03] jesus christ you remember the quote the
[1:22:05] other day where i was reading it spoken
[1:22:07] word original seed
[1:22:08] said this prophet in the last days would
[1:22:11] be pointing to a word born bride
[1:22:18] well what good is it to point to me to
[1:22:20] you
[1:22:23] right
[1:22:26] i mean the worst thing you get is
[1:22:27] pointing fingers is you got problems
[1:22:29] about what you're pointing at
[1:22:32] but he said he'd be pointing to a word
[1:22:34] born bro well
[1:22:36] that's one of these days brother dale
[1:22:38] maybe 50 years from now
[1:22:42] you know what that means it means you
[1:22:44] ain't going to have to have nothing to
[1:22:45] do with it
[1:22:46] because you're going to be dead
[1:22:48] and that's what we baptist used to say
[1:22:51] you say the lord is coming you let
[1:22:53] people you go and start talking to them
[1:22:55] and just make it real sly like around
[1:22:57] about the coming of the lord yes sir the
[1:22:59] lord's here we believe the lord's coming
[1:23:01] he's coming and
[1:23:03] it really ain't no telling how quick
[1:23:07] and you start talking about the signs of
[1:23:09] his coming
[1:23:10] well nobody knows the day and or the
[1:23:14] hour
[1:23:15] yes it may be 50 years from now
[1:23:21] that means you ain't got no
[1:23:24] responsibility because most everybody in
[1:23:26] here 50 years from now
[1:23:28] would be dead
[1:23:32] or dying
[1:23:36] but just think about it
[1:23:38] my simple little point is try to get a
[1:23:40] point across to us
[1:23:44] what speaks of the bride groom
[1:23:46] speaks of the bride
[1:23:48] amen
[1:23:50] he's smitten for the church you and i
[1:23:51] are spent from the church
[1:23:53] he was rejected of mankind you and i are
[1:23:55] rejected of
[1:24:00] mankind he was persecuted you're not
[1:24:04] persecuted well ain't nobody do it no
[1:24:06] not
[1:24:07] but they're beginning right now to pick
[1:24:09] up a few things
[1:24:12] right
[1:24:14] and they're beginning to bring forth
[1:24:15] some things that they're going to
[1:24:19] be able to take us to court one day too
[1:24:24] like the man in zimbabwe sister milka
[1:24:26] brought
[1:24:28] he's a polygamist and everything you
[1:24:30] know what they're going to do they want
[1:24:31] to know now what he taught the people
[1:24:34] to get them to come into that
[1:24:44] see a lot of things happening here in
[1:24:46] the united states too you know
[1:24:49] a lot of things going on
[1:24:52] right but you see church i'm not worried
[1:24:54] about all that i'm just concerned with
[1:24:56] you and i to realize who we are and what
[1:24:58] we're doing
[1:25:01] we have nothing against the government
[1:25:03] we have nothing against the churches we
[1:25:05] have nothing against the world
[1:25:12] i think we're all doing pretty good
[1:25:15] we're all getting fat
[1:25:18] and we all at least was able to drive to
[1:25:20] church today think another day about
[1:25:22] first time we went to jamaica in 93 i
[1:25:25] believe it was many more cars and the
[1:25:28] junk they was riding in
[1:25:29] i mean
[1:25:32] i wouldn't have started home in one of
[1:25:34] them
[1:25:35] you know if i did i'd had to tie the
[1:25:36] doors on and things
[1:25:38] and the door doorknobs was totally just
[1:25:40] tore off where they'd run into each
[1:25:41] other and everything else and we went
[1:25:43] back in 95
[1:25:45] and then in them they went i think was
[1:25:47] 95 and
[1:25:49] and they thought it was bad
[1:25:51] honey they beautiful
[1:25:53] they begin to have cars of course they
[1:25:55] had 200 000 miles on them but they began
[1:25:57] to have cars that you could ride in
[1:26:01] i told you about seeing them tires on
[1:26:02] that car that night and the first time
[1:26:04] looking at it and pulled up i thought
[1:26:06] what kind of tire is that had these
[1:26:08] strings hanging out you know
[1:26:10] flopping i thought well we got feelers
[1:26:12] to try to find side you know
[1:26:15] you remember the old days of the feelers
[1:26:16] they don't use them much no more but we
[1:26:18] had all that
[1:26:19] and i thought well that might be what
[1:26:20] that is i walked around the front of
[1:26:22] that car and looked at it i went over
[1:26:25] that brother and i handed him some money
[1:26:26] and gave it to him the next day i said
[1:26:28] don't you drive no more
[1:26:30] until you get some tires on that car
[1:26:33] and he had drove 50 or 60 miles
[1:26:36] at 60 mile an hour around the mountains
[1:26:38] getting to where we were at
[1:26:41] you know what that was that was the old
[1:26:42] polyester tires
[1:26:46] there was no tread
[1:26:49] the whole thing that held it on was done
[1:26:52] gone
[1:26:54] they were riding on that inner lining
[1:26:58] of the tire
[1:27:00] and that was this polyester strings
[1:27:03] hanging out
[1:27:06] but you know what today they got better
[1:27:08] cars
[1:27:10] better tires
[1:27:13] a point
[1:27:14] you and i
[1:27:15] we're at ease and time
[1:27:17] we really need something to go come on
[1:27:19] brothers we need something to start
[1:27:24] knocking us around a little bit
[1:27:27] to make us get concerned
[1:27:32] yeah
[1:27:33] because we just kind of relaxed
[1:27:38] but do you get the point
[1:27:40] what speaks of the bridegroom speaks of
[1:27:42] the bride so just read the bible and
[1:27:44] read yourself into it
[1:27:47] and see that it's talking about you
[1:27:53] we really read it as
[1:27:55] things to try to women's hair dress
[1:27:58] clothes or something to beat people with
[1:28:02] you know and we got we like to quote
[1:28:04] that over in in uh
[1:28:08] what is
[1:28:09] the old testament where the woman's not
[1:28:11] to wear a garment pertaining to a man
[1:28:14] well that's good i believe it
[1:28:16] deuteronomy
[1:28:18] about 25
[1:28:20] but have you read the rest of that verse
[1:28:27] have you ever read the rest of that
[1:28:28] verse
[1:28:30] where it says in for a man not to wear
[1:28:32] the garment pertaining to one
[1:28:35] we want to quote half of it but we don't
[1:28:38] want to read it all
[1:28:41] right
[1:28:43] see we want the part that we want to use
[1:28:45] for whips and things to beat with
[1:28:49] instead of using it to try to help
[1:28:55] i hope you understand a lot of people
[1:28:57] don't understand me when i speak i say
[1:28:58] i'm not trying to get people to be good
[1:29:00] no no no i'm trying to get you to be
[1:29:01] born again
[1:29:04] if you're born again it's going to come
[1:29:05] to that basis of his goodness not ours
[1:29:10] but you see church
[1:29:13] what speaks of him the word made flesh
[1:29:16] john 1 14.
[1:29:19] isn't it odd the prophet would come over
[1:29:21] and emphasize that that we used them
[1:29:24] over and over and over where he said the
[1:29:25] bride in the end time is a word made
[1:29:27] flesh
[1:29:33] and see he's the word made flesh
[1:29:39] he's just he's one and we're not
[1:29:41] supposed to be one
[1:29:44] we're a many-membered bride but remember
[1:29:46] every member of that body is jesus
[1:29:49] christ made manifest
[1:29:51] in that person
[1:29:57] there's no idea
[1:29:59] 103 in the red book
[1:30:01] 103 in the red book anybody have an 8.
[1:30:05] you have long
[1:30:07] for sweet peas
[1:30:10] and for faith
[1:30:32] until
[1:30:39] you know that's all god
[1:30:58] almighty god
[1:31:14] see we we look down we can condemn we
[1:31:20] like the prophet said one day and said
[1:31:22] there what must we do to be saved we
[1:31:24] tell them to quit this quit that don't
[1:31:26] do this don't do that i said that wasn't
[1:31:29] what they asked
[1:31:35] those are supposed to be attributes of
[1:31:37] our doings we're not supposed to be
[1:31:39] living like that if we are we're lost
[1:31:58] what about it
[1:32:06] we're just looking to condemn instead of
[1:32:08] trying to look into the heart of people
[1:32:16] don't worry about it we can do our own
[1:32:18] sales
[1:32:21] how many of you remember the story that
[1:32:23] was told about the man up in canada
[1:32:28] that the brother
[1:32:31] saw a prostitute
[1:32:34] standing on the street
[1:32:40] the lord spoke to it
[1:32:43] he stopped
[1:32:45] started talking to that woman
[1:32:51] wound up me and he said how much is your
[1:32:54] cost of your time
[1:32:59] he handed her the money
[1:33:10] when she sat down in the car and what
[1:33:12] the rest of the story
[1:33:14] he told her he said i don't want your
[1:33:15] body i ain't talking about that i'm
[1:33:17] talking about your soul like to scare
[1:33:19] the lady to death
[1:33:23] he said the lord told me to stop talking
[1:33:25] to you
[1:33:28] she said i thought i was true said i
[1:33:31] used to be a christian but
[1:33:36] said the lord's dealing with you
[1:33:38] she came to the lord right there
[1:33:46] but how many of us would think well i'm
[1:33:48] not gonna do that but
[1:33:54] i'm not asking nobody to go to a
[1:33:55] honky-tonk to bar room i don't think
[1:33:57] that either
[1:33:59] but i'm just saying for all of us to
[1:34:01] quit looking down at others
[1:34:04] to start looking to jesus christ
[1:34:06] and praying for them people
[1:34:11] try to look in the eyes of god
[1:34:18] see what he sees
[1:34:25] and have peace and sweet your dismiss
[1:34:28] remember the service this afternoon
[1:34:38] is
[1:35:06] you
