[0:00] oh look at that okay all
[0:05] right driver
[0:10] bit
[0:14] okay all right we're headed in the right
[0:17] direction now okay now we've been
[0:19] talking on the first seal for
[0:23] now
[0:25] weeks
[0:26] um we want to take the first deal and I
[0:29] want to go back up
[0:35] over helloo hello
[0:42] hello on the first seal we have
[0:46] um come to conclusion and I I want you
[0:49] to really see this cuz you're going to
[0:50] have to see it for yourself I thought
[0:52] this this week I thought well we'll cut
[0:55] it off here and then go on but let's
[0:56] back up just one more day and one more
[0:59] Sunday and come
[1:00] look at cuz you're going to have to you
[1:02] going have to dig this out for yourself
[1:03] because even when brother Brandon
[1:05] preached it and then brother Dale
[1:06] preached in 82 even those tapes listen
[1:08] you got to get your own it can't be
[1:13] contrary but you got to have your own
[1:14] Revel you got to be able to see cuz I
[1:16] can tell you that the first seal shows
[1:18] one true and living God but you got to
[1:19] see that you got to see how that that
[1:22] writer is a different person than God
[1:26] and he's not holy he's Unholy you got
[1:30] see that there's not any Holiness about
[1:32] him but there's a lot of religion about
[1:34] him yes he's religious I I don't want
[1:37] anyone to ever tell me I'm religious
[1:41] right amen right the devil's the this
[1:45] the most religious person besides the
[1:47] Lord Jesus Christ That Ever Walked on
[1:49] the face of the Earth or in heaven or in
[1:51] any other dimension so that's what we
[1:54] have to deal with is that man that guy
[1:56] that fellow like brother R was talking
[1:58] about in the first seal
[2:00] and
[2:01] um and I don't believe we can see the
[2:04] Antichrist until we see Jesus
[2:06] Christ we must see let me place that
[2:10] again we can't see what his tactics are
[2:13] and what he's doing until we see the
[2:15] real listen you take a picture of
[2:18] something you get a negative right off
[2:21] that negative you get a picture but
[2:23] there's got to be a positive of you a
[2:26] real that's why I was talking about um
[2:28] um reflection or an image in a in a a
[2:32] mirror
[2:34] okay but man has been you can see now I
[2:38] see more than ever how that Satan has
[2:41] come so close you know brother said U
[2:44] man has got into God's laboratory right
[2:47] see we can have a virgin birth now
[2:49] that's right but we can't have a virgin
[2:51] birth without an egg from
[2:55] some you understand what I'm saying
[2:57] right but you can't take an egg in a and
[2:59] and a sperm we I we just saw that not
[3:01] too long ago when this daughter couldn't
[3:03] have a child and her actually her mother
[3:07] had her own
[3:08] grandbaby right
[3:10] now whatever situation you want to say
[3:13] that's their business but to me that's a
[3:14] little bit messed up yeah but you can do
[3:17] it why can you do it because what
[3:20] happened in the garden then you come
[3:22] down to what happened to
[3:23] Mary but Mary was not received a a germ
[3:27] and then an egg came down right
[3:30] God created both and put see man can't
[3:32] create they got to go get an egg
[3:34] somewhere they got to go get a sperm or
[3:36] a germ somewhere and put them together
[3:38] but they can surely put them in a virgin
[3:39] and have a birth right same way with now
[3:42] with
[3:43] photoshopping you can take an image and
[3:46] you can distort it you can make it look
[3:48] good you can make it look bad so
[3:50] what God has never took an image of
[3:54] himself and had to redo it that's right
[3:58] amen he's never have to take an image
[4:00] and redo it that's right we were made in
[4:02] His image in the beginning right amen
[4:07] right but we had to come this way
[4:08] because of what happened with Adam and
[4:10] Eve we had to come in this thing right
[4:12] to keep me together down here keep my
[4:15] spirit and my and my soul intact that's
[4:18] right but for God to work out through
[4:20] this you know I was thinking the other
[4:22] day the only one time that Paul talks
[4:24] about you know I pray that I think it's
[4:26] in Timothy I pray that your whole body
[4:29] that your
[4:30] Soul spirit and body be what found
[4:33] blameless he put the body in
[4:36] there he put the body in there okay he
[4:39] added the body because I'm telling you
[4:41] again and and listen don't get so that's
[4:44] what I say about quoters quoters say
[4:45] well brother R said sins in your flesh
[4:48] your flesh cannot
[4:50] sin it has no motivating factor to sin
[4:54] on its own right
[4:58] right your body only does what the
[5:01] firing mechanism on the inside tells it
[5:03] to do that's right that's right okay
[5:05] that's right I was thinking yesterday at
[5:07] the at the festival we saw many many
[5:09] children that were deformed and and um
[5:14] um you know it's just genetics man has
[5:17] just jumped into God's laboratory so
[5:18] much that's why God wants to keep
[5:19] everything pure he wants to keep the
[5:21] line pure he want to keep those
[5:22] levitical priest keep that line that
[5:25] lineage because when you cross two
[5:28] together you're going to get a recessive
[5:30] gene are you going to get I'm I'm sorry
[5:32] going this way but we got to go to this
[5:34] to get back to the seal because that
[5:36] recessive gene in the mother or father
[5:39] like brother R said now how and I thank
[5:41] God I talked to brother George Quinn
[5:42] yesterday was talking about brother
[5:44] Marlo passing away and well by email I
[5:47] didn't talk to him but we were talking
[5:48] by email and it's just great how God
[5:51] give us a prophet that could go in the
[5:53] mind of God and tell us exactly what God
[5:55] not what man not what man's come up with
[5:58] that's right but what literally is over
[5:59] on that other side that's right mhm
[6:02] people they don't eat because they don't
[6:04] have flesh bodies but they have a
[6:05] theophany body and they're waiting and
[6:07] and that's where they're all at and and
[6:09] then a prophet to tell us how that that
[6:12] uh he prayed for a little girl with
[6:13] epilepsy and he said oh that come from
[6:15] the grandfather three generations ago oh
[6:17] my how' you how' you do that God had to
[6:20] take him back and then remember the U
[6:23] the time where the
[6:25] Indians he went out to that reservation
[6:27] and they had lost all their records
[6:28] about who was who what was what and then
[6:30] brother Billy Paul said brother R sat
[6:32] down at the table brought each person
[6:34] and told them who their mother was who
[6:36] their father was who their grandparents
[6:38] were well who was that that wasn't
[6:40] William brandom that was almighty God
[6:41] that's right showing the genetic line to
[6:44] the prophet and he could tell them whose
[6:47] family they were in like same thing you
[6:49] say well boy that's amazing no it's not
[6:51] it's God that's right there 144,000 over
[6:54] there in Israel right now I believe
[6:56] they're all alive okay right coming to
[6:59] adulthood are already
[7:00] adult that they don't know where they
[7:02] come from but God knows where every one
[7:04] of them and I believe them two prophets
[7:06] will sit down just like brother brandham
[7:08] did cuz remember it's a spirit off of
[7:10] this right Spirit off of this Prophet
[7:13] brother brandham going over and taking
[7:16] the fifth coming of Elijah yeah so that
[7:18] same spirit's going to sit down and say
[7:19] hey you're levite you're Benjamin you're
[7:22] and just deser for 3 and 1/2 years they
[7:25] got to kind of tell them where they're
[7:26] at right cuz remember a Jew holds a lot
[7:28] to that for that lineage okay and that
[7:32] lineage will be 144,000 they won't be
[7:34] one over and one less so there's got to
[7:36] be a
[7:37] generation same way with this talking
[7:39] about this first seal there's got to be
[7:40] something we see in this seal that takes
[7:43] your genealogy and puts it in
[7:46] God and the other genealogy is the one
[7:50] riding away the one that's messed up the
[7:52] one that's perverted the one that's see
[7:55] what I'm saying then like you take now
[7:57] with with all the things that can do
[7:58] with television they can put you in a
[8:00] place you had never been before and
[8:02] you've never been there before you know
[8:04] so uh Satan has worked so close and and
[8:08] you can see it in in the things that uh
[8:11] that science comes up with Hey listen
[8:14] cell phones um wireless internet was
[8:18] back in the
[8:20] garden God spoke to Adam that's right
[8:23] yes but now he literally spoke to Adam
[8:25] you know what God had to come down and
[8:27] speak to Moses now remember surely they
[8:31] taught lift ear but not like Adam and
[8:32] God did before the fall no no no man
[8:34] cannot do that anymore until we come
[8:37] back in a glorified body there's no way
[8:39] God can talk like he did with Adam
[8:41] before the fall I believe he walked
[8:43] right down into that I believe there
[8:45] wasn't any Dimensions except the one
[8:46] they were living in that's right and God
[8:48] would just walk up and talk to Adam just
[8:49] like just like me and him talk together
[8:51] but now Moses and God never talked
[8:53] together in that form I don't believe
[8:56] cuz he said I'll not be able to strive
[8:58] with man anymore in other words I can't
[8:59] flesh to flesh I can't meet but I got to
[9:02] come in human flesh in Jesus Christ
[9:05] that's why he had to be our brother then
[9:06] he could talk to us see that's to me
[9:09] that's very simple Adam see God sure
[9:12] absolutely he saw God I believe he did
[9:15] Brother R said he come down the cool of
[9:16] the day talked to Adam and Eve walked in
[9:18] the garden with him walked in the garden
[9:19] with him sure he
[9:22] did Where Art Thou
[9:25] Adam H he said Where Art Thou Adam yeah
[9:29] sure
[9:30] Hey listen whatever happened before the
[9:32] fall that's what we're going back to so
[9:34] don't tell me we're going to go to
[9:35] heaven and not see
[9:36] God
[9:38] inum flesh
[9:42] correct in human flesh he didn't have
[9:44] human flesh in that's why you can
[9:48] believe that if you
[9:49] want but
[9:52] anyway you believe that if you want to
[9:54] but he had a lot of substance about him
[9:55] when he killed those lambs and tore
[9:58] skins off of
[10:00] so I'm not either way I'm not saying
[10:03] that is a subject to bring up talk about
[10:05] but a got we got to talk about rer today
[10:09] yes but I believe God and Adam were that
[10:11] close before the
[10:13] fall he come down he said it was a
[10:16] family brother BR said God come down as
[10:19] a father and talk to Adam and Eve so I
[10:20] believe he tal yeah I believe Adam
[10:22] literally saw God knew who he
[10:26] was but now when sin happen happened God
[10:29] had to withdraw himself and make
[10:31] Dimensions so that there was a buffer
[10:33] there cuz listen God we say oh God's God
[10:37] he can do anything he wants to no he
[10:39] can't God can only go by what he's
[10:41] already said that's
[10:43] right and he I don't believe he ever met
[10:46] a
[10:47] man until Jesus came on Earth he never
[10:50] met a man like he did Adam you know
[10:51] talking met a man now sure mzc but what
[10:54] was that that was a borrowed
[10:56] body remember what brother rown said he
[10:58] just picked up 16 elements and put it
[11:00] over the form of that man mzd right so
[11:04] that wasn't the body of God but now
[11:06] Jesus Christ was the body of God that's
[11:08] right okay that was the body of God
[11:10] right man saw and even Peter said we
[11:12] held him right boy I mean that's CL we
[11:15] held him well see what is he doing it's
[11:16] bringing Adam and Eve back together I
[11:18] mean Adam and God back together again
[11:20] yes and who's coming with him Eve he's
[11:22] got Eve's got to come with him to come
[11:24] back into uh full restoration cuz he's
[11:28] not going to restore Adam and EV the
[11:30] second Eve us right we've got to come up
[11:33] with him we' got to come up with that
[11:35] second Adam so and that's what you see
[11:37] in the seals you can take this first
[11:39] seal tie the entire Bible together with
[11:41] it and not go to another one cuz it
[11:43] shows one true and living God but watch
[11:46] right here now
[11:48] look but Satan hides himself like I said
[11:51] before he he can you know he can change
[11:53] forms he can he can do all these
[11:55] different things he can make himself
[11:57] this the other but he can't create
[11:59] anything yeah I take something that's
[12:00] already created and pervert it all right
[12:03] so watch here what brother Bown says I
[12:05] want you to read this right here this is
[12:07] in the first
[12:08] seal the that white horse rider has been
[12:11] in the land all the
[12:14] time so he just didn't get on the horse
[12:17] in 1963 and start riding right now as
[12:20] soon as Christ came on the scene Judas
[12:22] came on the same the
[12:25] Antichrist but it was in the form of
[12:27] what a saying we'll get into that just
[12:29] that's what I want to come back to
[12:31] because to me it explains how God goes
[12:34] through justification sanctification
[12:35] baptism Holy Ghost the devil goes
[12:37] through the same three stages cuz he
[12:40] goes devil Spirit we'll talk about a
[12:43] minute but you got to start something
[12:46] little God has to start with you little
[12:49] baby form justification forgive me of my
[12:51] sins Lord I am a sinner right and he's
[12:55] just to forgive every person in the
[12:57] world that ask that question but what
[12:59] problem is is people in the that are
[13:02] taught in the other uh Realms of
[13:04] religion is is that that's it right like
[13:08] the Baptist you know once saved always
[13:09] saved I got that you know I was I was I
[13:12] was saved in when I was 9 years old but
[13:14] I done whatever I wanted to up to this
[13:17] point no they've not been taught right
[13:19] that yes that God did forgive them of
[13:21] their sins but they continued as a
[13:24] sinner because God never entered in and
[13:25] resided in that man or woman to make
[13:28] them a born again Christian but like I
[13:30] said thank God for William Bram to bring
[13:32] us a a message to show us the whole
[13:34] thing yes cuz to me don't ever forget
[13:37] this message this message
[13:39] brought one God to the world like it had
[13:43] never been brought before even with the
[13:46] apostles because they never understood
[13:47] the son of man because you got to bring
[13:48] the son of man in to one God that's
[13:52] right he was God wasn't he right okay so
[13:55] you got to bring son of man in which the
[13:57] which the apostles
[13:59] sure they looked at Jesus Christ they
[14:01] thought they they I don't say they
[14:02] thought they knew he was God but they
[14:04] really didn't understand the whole
[14:07] way that God wanted to manifest himself
[14:10] which was an adopted son what brother
[14:12] Dale's teaching now we come up to a
[14:13] place to where sure they had Authority
[14:16] they had Authority Under the face of the
[14:18] fathers right but they never come to a
[14:21] change of a body or even the ability to
[14:23] because
[14:24] of even
[14:26] Paul and I I didn't find that scripture
[14:29] this morning but I find it next Sunday
[14:31] my legs getting
[14:32] num got what Daddy give me that that
[14:37] hereditary yes ain't never happened
[14:40] before boo devil get out of here Shake
[14:41] It Off yeah shake it
[14:43] off but we come to a place we see that
[14:47] that Paul even says Grievous wolves will
[14:50] come among you now we stop there but if
[14:52] you'll keep reading that scripture says
[14:53] and are already here yeah so that's what
[14:56] this is the white horse rider has been
[14:57] in the land all all the time he will
[15:00] change from Antichrist he does that and
[15:02] becomes to a false prophet see he first
[15:05] started an antichrist the spirit then he
[15:07] became a false prophet that later when
[15:09] the devil's cast out he is Incarnate
[15:11] then with with the devil three stages
[15:13] first he the devil begin with SP of the
[15:15] devil then he becomes a false prophet
[15:17] teacher of a false Doctrine next thing
[15:19] he comes as the very Devil Himself in
[15:23] carnate same thing with Christ Christ
[15:25] comes down through the Old Testament
[15:26] shows itself all the way down through
[15:28] the Old Testament as the Christ as the
[15:30] anointed one not as a person you
[15:33] understand not not in them they couldn't
[15:35] truly see him as a person but then when
[15:37] he come on the earth what he was the
[15:39] prophet not a false prophet the prophet
[15:42] that's right amen all right it was the
[15:44] spirit of God let's just look now this
[15:46] we're not talking about this but look
[15:48] starting as the Antichrist the spirit
[15:50] God started his Spirit come down through
[15:52] the Old Testament as a spirit okay right
[15:55] sure he would reveal himself in
[15:57] different forms but he was always of us
[15:59] right couldn't go into this into the
[16:01] interior of man and make that man
[16:04] totally totally whole no sin in his soul
[16:07] at all right but he come Christ comes as
[16:10] a spirit so guess who's coming right
[16:12] with him Satan's coming right with him
[16:14] as a spirit that's right that's right a
[16:16] little saying a little this a little
[16:18] that then he become the false prophet
[16:21] well Jesus Christ became the prophet
[16:23] right yeah God in human flesh right
[16:25] right then look then he become the false
[16:28] prophet teach false Dr next thing he
[16:30] comes as the very Devil Himself
[16:32] incarnate now he said oh where you going
[16:35] with that well that's
[16:38] us that's us that's not us but the
[16:42] positive of that is
[16:45] us we are the very God himself
[16:50] incarnate that's what brother Ram said
[16:52] whether you believe it or not he said
[16:53] the son of man will be here and be
[16:55] incarnate God God can't be here in one
[16:58] man in flesh like he was back then until
[17:01] what the Millennium because of the sin
[17:03] curse and all the things that's going to
[17:05] happen but you and I have to be
[17:07] incarnate God to get out of here that's
[17:09] right that's right that's right so he's
[17:12] going to as soon as we become incarnate
[17:14] God and we take a Rapture okay Satan's
[17:16] going to become incarnate Devil in a man
[17:19] called a pope and he will be the devil
[17:22] made manifest in another form called a
[17:24] pope you can say what you want do false
[17:26] prophet Pope incarnate false prophet
[17:29] we'll get into
[17:30] that look and at the same time that this
[17:35] devil falls out of heaven and becomes
[17:37] incarnate in a man the Holy Spirit goes
[17:39] up and comes down in incarnate
[17:45] man oh my what a
[17:48] time you understand that he falls he
[17:51] falls out of heaven and becomes
[17:53] incarnate here what's what the Holy
[17:55] Ghost is going up but he's coming down
[17:57] and incarnate man the Holy Ghost had
[17:59] come back on the day of
[18:00] Pentecost right they were incarnate God
[18:03] they just didn't know all that they
[18:04] needed to know to take them to a body
[18:06] change but we will know somebody will
[18:09] know that they're not God himself we're
[18:12] God himself made manifest in another
[18:14] form called Bri yes not a second person
[18:18] that's why I've always you you go to the
[18:19] you go to Genesis and you think God
[18:21] created something and that's another
[18:24] something read Oneness with God God said
[18:29] true Oneness is God Adam and Eve
[18:31] standing in the garden even before the
[18:32] fall he said when you look at them you
[18:33] see three but when God looks at it he
[18:35] sees
[18:39] one that really helped me understand
[18:42] true
[18:43] Oneness um reading that Oneness with God
[18:46] and it really helped me a lot when when
[18:48] that Doctrine came out about the Jesus
[18:50] not being God to the River
[18:53] Jordan because it there's several quotes
[18:55] in there that really knocks that down
[18:57] but
[18:59] as God has already wrote out if listen
[19:02] if Satan was in the land God was already
[19:05] here right he already prepared a church
[19:08] in the first three Church ages he
[19:09] prepared a church to withstand that
[19:13] Antichrist Spirit at the beginning
[19:15] that's right but it wasn't strong enough
[19:17] now his spirit is but Spirit filtered
[19:20] through man we got to bring man's got to
[19:21] come in here that's right somewhere okay
[19:24] and there's another quote in the second
[19:26] seal where brother said God decided to
[19:29] use
[19:30] man okay so and we look like we're
[19:33] messing up and we say man we ain't even
[19:35] able to hardly be good Christians on the
[19:38] Earth but God chose us to finish this
[19:41] thing that's right right he he chose us
[19:43] to start it Adam and he chose us to
[19:46] finish him that's right amen so here we
[19:49] are I mean this is the way it's going to
[19:50] happen it's not going to happen any
[19:51] other way that's right right this is
[19:53] what it's going to happen we have got to
[19:54] see God is going to reveal one God to
[19:58] somebody so much to where he they don't
[20:01] say my father's someone else they say I
[20:04] my father one when Jesus said that he
[20:05] wasn't lying
[20:07] that's that's true he was telling the
[20:09] truth that's right and there was
[20:10] somebody preached it not too long ago
[20:12] one of the brothers that came in that
[20:14] that I really enjoy CU always said it
[20:16] brother D always said it I my father one
[20:18] if you start saying
[20:20] that what is that that's true Oneness
[20:22] that's right you said no I see too
[20:24] remember God is when God said let us
[20:26] make man our own image he made millions
[20:27] of his children
[20:30] all the bride was created if you want to
[20:32] say are revealed right there why I love
[20:35] that scripture Genesis 126 everybody
[20:37] that's a child of God from the from um
[20:40] 120 in the upper room all the way to the
[20:43] last one that comes in that's that
[20:45] Genesis 126 man not somebody else not
[20:49] Moses not
[20:50] Elijah hello somebody not the
[20:55] 144,000 no his children his bride we're
[20:58] the only people that are created in His
[21:00] image to look just like him and not be
[21:03] the devil's children right amen now
[21:07] Moses Elijah all them will be as an
[21:09] impartation of eternal life by the faith
[21:12] that they had that's right right that's
[21:15] right but they're not ever called the
[21:17] children of God Abraham being the
[21:19] greatest one of all that I believe
[21:21] because he was the father of our faith
[21:23] right God called him a friend Bible
[21:25] calls him a friend of God he was a son
[21:28] of God
[21:29] true everybody's a Son of God by birth
[21:31] see that's why you got to have to be
[21:32] careful have to be careful everybody's a
[21:34] Son of God by birth that's right but
[21:36] when Genesis 1 when he spoke at Genesis
[21:38] 126 man it was a multiple form all of
[21:41] his bride all of the ones that ever was
[21:44] going to receive the new birth in their
[21:47] soul was created right then not created
[21:49] as far as not having cuz remember if
[21:51] we're created we got to have an end okay
[21:54] that's why this has got to be changed
[21:56] but our soul never had a beginning right
[21:58] that's right and never had an end we
[22:00] were in the mind of God he thought of
[22:02] all of us but when he said let us make
[22:04] man in our image there you are you know
[22:07] what he
[22:08] done he wrote it according to the word
[22:11] and he wrote the word according to that
[22:13] okay those where you come
[22:15] from well I say word I'm pointing to
[22:17] brother BR message but you understand
[22:19] what I mean the Bible yes we come from
[22:20] the word of God what brother Dale was
[22:22] trying to get us see you know Wednesday
[22:23] night we are we are we develop from the
[22:26] word of God we're always we've always
[22:28] and I agree with them we always were
[22:30] Eternal in that part that's right yes
[22:35] right but that word had to come down
[22:37] here that's right because even in the
[22:40] Oneness with God and I asked a brother a
[22:43] question he never answered me brother
[22:45] Bram says that the apostles acted the
[22:47] way they acted because God wasn't in
[22:49] them
[22:51] yet now boy that kind of knocks up and
[22:54] and you know what would be so if if they
[22:56] got the 120 in the upper room but if you
[22:58] got
[22:59] he even the disciples he breathed on and
[23:01] said receive ye the Holy Ghost now he's
[23:02] God Almighty in human flesh why didn't
[23:04] they just Why didn't that seed just come
[23:05] to life right then they had to go to the
[23:07] upper room and or they had to hear a
[23:09] word that's right to Quicken what they
[23:12] had held they took the word and held it
[23:15] okay then you put the Holy Ghost on that
[23:17] word okay that's what brings it to life
[23:21] okay so that way I agree God created all
[23:24] of us way before the foundation of the
[23:25] world that's right but you got to come
[23:27] here and develop that
[23:29] that's right you got to come here and
[23:31] develop you got to accept it God knew
[23:33] you would okay so he already put it in
[23:35] the Bible cuz all of us all of us became
[23:39] Born Again by a certain scripture not
[23:40] just you say well I well I have one
[23:42] favorite one but you reading through the
[23:45] Bible and or preacher preaches well
[23:47] what's he he already be preaching what's
[23:48] in the Bible that's right right that's
[23:50] right what quickened that you you you
[23:53] were quickened by what he said that's
[23:55] right you were being born by the spoken
[23:58] word word amen like it had should have
[24:01] been had they not been a fall okay amen
[24:04] right that's exactly what would have
[24:06] happened going to fall you just been
[24:07] spoken word but that's beyond the point
[24:09] because that didn't happen because of
[24:10] all the other attributes of God that's
[24:12] right but first he's the devil with he's
[24:15] a spirit Spirit of the devil false
[24:17] prophet of a false Doctrine so what did
[24:20] he do in the first three ages it was the
[24:23] same that's right a saying went out well
[24:27] hey remember what uh
[24:29] brother Bob brought me when we were
[24:30] talking about Jesus not being God sthus
[24:33] back in whose age was it
[24:35] irenius I believe it was irus and Martin
[24:37] somewhere in there somewhere in these
[24:39] first three ages guy named sthus comes
[24:41] out with a doctrine that Jesus was not
[24:43] God until he indwell him in the at the
[24:47] River Jordan same thing they teaching
[24:50] now and irus were somebody run out of
[24:52] the bath house and said if he's in there
[24:54] I don't want to be in
[24:55] there I in other words I don't want to
[24:57] be near that Doctrine right okay yeah we
[25:01] kind of pet it sometimes but they were
[25:02] pretty Stern I mean they them first
[25:04] three ages buddy they cut you off okay
[25:08] so it should be back the same way this
[25:09] way but it became a sa then when he went
[25:12] to NAA in 30
[25:14] 306 then it took 300 more years to what
[25:17] they come to a place to where they crown
[25:18] a
[25:20] pope right 606 I'm going to read it to
[25:24] you if I have I got enough time I got to
[25:26] go hook up brother for cash but uh the
[25:29] next one let me look let's look at
[25:38] it let's
[25:42] see let's read this one anyway right
[25:44] here so we are Mortals we can make
[25:46] mistakes God can't God's first decision
[25:48] is perfect and the way he chooses to do
[25:51] it it can't be no other better way I've
[25:53] told y'all many times there's no other
[25:54] better way if you don't understand the
[25:56] word of God it's cuz you're not born
[25:58] again that's right or you haven't been
[26:00] caught well one of the two that's right
[26:02] but if you stay in the word long enough
[26:04] it's got to Quicken because it's got to
[26:05] be Quicken by itself word quickening
[26:08] word right that's right that's right he
[26:10] can't improve on it because it's perfect
[26:12] to begin with if it isn't he is an
[26:15] infinite if he is infinite then he's
[26:17] omniscient if he's omniscient he's
[26:19] omnipotent amen he's got to be that our
[26:23] wisdom here comes from Satan We
[26:26] inherited it from Eden
[26:30] M really that's when Satan got on his
[26:32] White Horse and started
[26:34] riding false Doctrine in the garden okay
[26:37] correct okay it wasn't that he started
[26:39] in the first church are he started right
[26:41] when God came down talking to Adam and
[26:42] Eve guess what Satan came down and what
[26:44] incarnated a beast
[26:48] okay and started talking to the bride
[26:51] that's right just like he's doing
[26:54] now inherited it from Eden where we
[26:58] swapped off faith for wisdom he did
[27:01] it now he was first called Antichrist
[27:04] the second stage he was called false
[27:05] prophet because that Spirit among the
[27:07] people became
[27:09] incarnate right you remember the white
[27:12] horse rider had no Crown when he started
[27:14] but then he was given a crown what he
[27:16] was a nickan spirit to begin with then
[27:18] he became incarnated in a man then he
[27:20] was crowned and received a throne and
[27:22] when he will serve that for a long time
[27:24] then talking about seal breaking we find
[27:26] out that after a long time Satan was
[27:28] kicked out of heaven and he came down
[27:30] according to the scripture and enthroned
[27:31] himself just think and enthroned himself
[27:34] in a man and become a beast and he had
[27:36] power supreme power like that he done
[27:38] all the Miracles and everything are the
[27:39] killings and bloody fightings that Rome
[27:42] could produce
[27:44] right Jesus died under that punishment
[27:47] Roman punishment yes for the Antichrist
[27:50] absolutely
[27:53] right he's talking about There They
[27:54] Crucified him
[27:59] first as Nick what did the nickan age
[28:02] ask for it asked to get away from them
[28:04] buch of people that shout clap their
[28:06] hands look like disgraceful like they
[28:08] did on Pentecost act like drunk men and
[28:10] I just messed
[28:13] up who I
[28:18] at they said they were drunk then the
[28:20] celebrity listen don't miss this it may
[28:22] sound
[28:24] crazy when God makes when when what
[28:27] makes God big is because he can he's big
[28:30] enough to stoop that right he stoop the
[28:33] Lord and anybody can stoop any human
[28:35] being ever stoop he was the king of
[28:36] Heaven came to lowest City Jericho and
[28:38] got sold till even the shortest man in
[28:40] town had to look down on him talk about
[28:42] that
[28:44] K how about all the
[28:48] family look now let's say take this
[28:51] church here and take a bunch of people
[28:52] like we are if you wasn't real spirit
[28:55] filled and let's take say now nothing
[28:56] against the mayor come Mr barart and
[29:00] talking about the board now you know
[29:01] what this ought to be different what you
[29:03] know what he's doing he's talking about
[29:05] the he's going to tell you in a minute
[29:07] that the bride you're talking about
[29:09] going to NAA that the true church went
[29:11] to NAA and got caught up in that
[29:13] religion what Satan was riding so close
[29:16] he deceived those people and they took
[29:20] see somewhere you had to do that
[29:22] somewhere because remember the first
[29:24] three Church ages never taught a father
[29:27] son Holy Ghost bapti ISM never taught of
[29:30] Trinity never taught hell being Eternal
[29:33] but somewhere in this age right here
[29:35] because when they come out of that
[29:36] Catholic age Martin Luther was teaching
[29:39] father son Holy Ghost baptism right
[29:41] Trinity Doctrine hell being Eternal okay
[29:46] cuz that's all your denominational
[29:47] Foundation coming out of right
[29:49] here what so it had to get into the real
[29:51] church that's right yes it had to that's
[29:55] right so Satan put himself injected
[29:57] itself right into the real church just
[29:59] like he did
[30:01] E told her everything was cool this is
[30:03] fine man everything's good this is God's
[30:05] way of doing it right that's what he
[30:07] told Eve right Thou shalt not surely die
[30:10] and that's what he told him right here
[30:11] same thing right don't don't worry about
[30:15] that them old like you said them old
[30:17] shouting speaking in Tong you know
[30:19] baptizing the name of the Lord Jesus
[30:20] Christ don't worry about them people
[30:22] this is God's program for the day now
[30:24] what happened that was the same thing
[30:26] that happened
[30:28] coming up now here this though is the
[30:31] Pinnacle see that's what shows you even
[30:33] from the first seal to us that first
[30:36] seal that white horse rider continues to
[30:38] ride right he doesn't die off he
[30:40] continues and actually rides on almost
[30:42] to the
[30:44] Millennium right cuz that that Spirit
[30:47] becomes incarnate in in a pop and that
[30:49] pop rules the world when we get out of
[30:51] here he rules this whole place
[30:55] spiritually see naturally the PO runs it
[30:58] now what Pope says that's what everybody
[31:00] does kind of that's right kind of
[31:03] Baptist ain't going to deal with all of
[31:04] it but they'll deal with some of it but
[31:06] not all of it that's why brother R said
[31:08] they'll all come together then see
[31:09] they're going to listen to what that
[31:10] Pope says that's right truly who's going
[31:13] to Crown that pop the denominational
[31:16] world's going going to Crown that poke
[31:19] which is that pale horse rider we're
[31:21] going to get to in several years the
[31:23] pale hor rider that's his all of his
[31:26] mixed Doctrine together and he's going
[31:28] to what and they're going to think
[31:30] everything's fine I was reading I've
[31:32] been reading the small gospels I love
[31:34] those small gospels F second John
[31:36] Timothy first second Timothy first
[31:38] second Thessalonian I go through and
[31:39] read them every once in a while cuz I
[31:41] like them first second Peter you know
[31:42] all the all the little gospels I call
[31:44] and cuz you get a you get a big punch
[31:46] every all the rest of them are kind of a
[31:47] commentary but man when John comes in
[31:49] and said the Antichrist is among
[31:52] you children beware the Antichrist is
[31:54] here you know I mean he's got pump CH
[31:56] cuz he's only got a short time variety
[31:58] you know make the point and um same way
[32:01] with um what the what is it
[32:04] Thessalonians where it says peace peace
[32:06] and then sudden destruction yes that's
[32:08] what's going to happen there's going to
[32:09] be a time of Peace we're going to see a
[32:11] time of peace and then all of a sudden
[32:13] boom but who's going to take over though
[32:16] we see that and we see that in the
[32:17] Christian realm we see that as us
[32:18] getting out of
[32:20] here right but the denominational world
[32:23] will see peace peace sudden destruction
[32:25] and then somebody's going to come on the
[32:27] scene to raise it back up again the
[32:30] Pope's going to come in and say I'll
[32:31] take care of all this and then he's
[32:33] going to spiritually Rule the World Plus
[32:36] physically rule the
[32:37] world CU you can see how physically he's
[32:40] ruling he stand up and say hey don't
[32:41] fight but you still got those
[32:43] denominations that some of them are like
[32:45] we're not going to listen to what he
[32:46] said but when they come to a point where
[32:47] everybody does what that one man says
[32:50] he's got control over the whole world
[32:51] see that's what Satan wants he wants to
[32:53] be just like Jesus Christ CU Jesus
[32:55] Christ is going to rule the world Bible
[32:56] says
[32:59] right so he wants to rule away he wants
[33:01] to do the same thing God does yes but
[33:03] bless his
[33:04] heart he ain't going to do
[33:06] it just put it in simple terms he just
[33:09] ain't going to do it we ain't going to
[33:11] let him God God's not going to let him
[33:14] and you know who's not going to let him
[33:15] do it
[33:16] through us the bride and the two
[33:20] prophets in 144,000 they're going to
[33:22] resist him to the place to where finally
[33:24] he kills them the Bible says finally
[33:27] something's going to happen to let him
[33:30] be able to kill them which I believe is
[33:32] just like see you look at that Spirit
[33:35] you see that Spirit come on Jesus on the
[33:37] river and then for three and a half
[33:38] years he couldn't die nothing could kill
[33:39] him right they tried to many many times
[33:42] they tried to Stone him they tried to
[33:43] back him up against the cliff and he
[33:45] went through the crowd you know he
[33:47] wasn't his time but when he come to
[33:48] Gethsemane the Spirit came off of him
[33:50] well that spirit's got to come back on
[33:52] me and you where we won't die but now
[33:55] remember that spirit's got to lift up
[33:57] and go all the way over to the 144,000
[33:59] for 3 and 1/2 years kind of strange for
[34:01] 3 and 1/2 years this all happens in 3
[34:03] and 1/2 year period 3 and 1/2 years they
[34:05] can't be killed don't you think they
[34:07] want to because the the prophet said all
[34:09] they got to do is speak tornadoes of
[34:11] whatever this hurricane they can just
[34:13] bring it right across Israel or or
[34:15] syrians or whatever they want to do they
[34:17] just say destroy that Nation wow you
[34:19] think they going to hate them they going
[34:20] to hate them but don't you think
[34:21] somebody's going to be an assassin and
[34:22] try to kill them in then three and a
[34:23] half years can't do it because the
[34:25] spirit's on them because they have to
[34:26] fulfill the 1260 days that's right then
[34:30] the two prophets are killed in 144,000
[34:32] so that's right but see where it comes
[34:34] from you come from one God you come from
[34:35] the first seal and you you see this from
[34:38] back from Before Time Satan's trying to
[34:40] do this remember he fought with Michael
[34:42] before all this started and then he got
[34:44] on a white horse he didn't get on a he
[34:46] didn't get on a he wasn't real obvious
[34:48] you know he gets on a white horse and he
[34:49] tries to ride right With God all the way
[34:51] down Through the Ages and that's what's
[34:53] happening now and um and I hope you see
[34:56] that it start and every little thing
[34:57] starts is a
[34:58] saying then it becomes a deed then what
[35:02] it becomes a Doctrine they come out and
[35:04] wrote the doctrine 606 did I see in
[35:06] counsel Jesus is a like substance of God
[35:08] therefore he must be the second person
[35:10] of the Trinity because the Holy Ghost is
[35:11] the third person of the Trinity and then
[35:13] you got a father see what I'm saying but
[35:16] see it started developing down here when
[35:18] that sthus guy when he broke forth and
[35:20] said Jesus wasn't God to the River
[35:21] Jordan he automatically split them in
[35:23] two right but Satan had to have what a
[35:26] triple ground so he had to make Father
[35:28] Son and Holy Ghost that's how everything
[35:31] starts so let's go ahead I going to go
[35:32] hook brother cash up the Lord bless you
[35:34] listen pray for the people in Haiti they
[35:37] were destroyed devastated had hurt
[35:40] anybody any
[35:41] believers they have been hurt bad also
[35:43] Florida and South Carolina Georgia and
[35:45] all up
