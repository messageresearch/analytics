[3:52] verse 15 here says know ye not that your

[4:05] of Christ and make them the members of
[4:07] an harlot god forbid what know you not

[4:16] flesh but he that is joined unto the
[4:19] lord is one spirit flee fornication
[4:21] every sin that is a that a man doeth is
[4:25] without the body but he that committeth
[4:27] fornication sinneth against his own body
[4:30] what know you know that your body is the
[4:33] temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you
[4:35] which ye have of God and you're not your
[4:39] own for ye are bought with a price
[4:41] therefore glorify God in your body and
[4:43] in your spirit which are gods
[4:45] a man god bless you tonight be seated
[4:50] and the others they'll just pray for me
[4:57] many many different things to look at
[5:01] here but you know I'm so glad that I can
[5:07] say that I'm not my own you know I'm you
[5:12] know Paul writing about being a prisoner
[5:14] and you know brother Brown talks about
[5:17] Paul being in that in that prison and
[5:20] the end of that dungeon but you know
[5:28] sometimes what we if we to look and see
[5:33] those you know the the prison that that
[5:37] Paul was in when he was writing these
[5:38] things and talking about being the the
[5:41] bonds that he was in
[5:43] you know you know you think about a dark
[5:46] done you know a dungeon this dingy place
[5:50] you know you think of the the kind of
[5:55] conditions that they had to live in you
[5:57] don't know what kind of food they had if
[5:59] they had food you know many times when
[6:01] if you look in the Roman Empire and
[6:04] different things like that going to
[6:07] prison was really a death sentence going
[6:11] to a dungeon was a place they held you
[6:13] till they killed you I mean there wasn't
[6:16] there wasn't appeals and different
[6:18] things that we have today that was a
[6:20] holding place - they killed you and
[6:22] other things they done was they if they
[6:25] did have in other situations they did
[6:29] have you where you were working and you
[6:32] were bound in this situation that you
[6:38] were there till you died and there was
[6:40] no recourse but you were there to do a
[6:43] job just like the children of Israel
[6:46] were bound in bondage in in Egypt you
[6:49] know they wanted them to build the
[6:53] sculptures and the pyramids of different
[6:55] things you know but so there was a job
[6:57] that they had to do but that was a death
[6:59] sentence to them because they were
[7:02] laboring in that until they died and you
[7:05] know the thing is if you died well they
[7:07] just rolled your carcass out of the way
[7:09] and put somebody else in there doing the
[7:10] same job that you were doing they there
[7:12] was not a and so you know when he talks
[7:14] about being a prisoner of Jesus Christ
[7:17] you know you think about the conditions
[7:19] that he was in where brother Ram said
[7:21] you know he didn't look at the condition
[7:23] that he lived in but he thought about
[7:25] being a prisoner of Jesus Christ being
[7:28] bound to him and Brent said that you
[7:31] know he was bound by the fetters of love
[7:33] to the word because Christ was the word
[7:37] Christ is the word but you know you know
[7:40] I think about being a prisoner and you
[7:43] know having not nothing of your own
[7:48] because you're not your own you know
[7:52] many times people talk about
[7:55] going in being in prison or going into
[7:59] jail and you know people have this they
[8:01] develop this prison mentality and you
[8:05] know the one of the first things that
[8:06] they want you to do when you go to
[8:08] prison is they want you to learn how to
[8:11] do everything their way they want you to
[8:13] think their thoughts because everything
[8:15] has to be done their way you know I
[8:18] think it was Sing Sing many many years
[8:21] ago believe was the prison that was back
[8:23] in the 1800s and you know we've all
[8:25] you've heard the term called lockstep
[8:27] well you know they was everybody was
[8:30] chained together and everybody had to
[8:32] learn how to walk in unison well when
[8:34] you first went to prison you learned how
[8:36] to walk you walk the prison walk
[8:38] everybody learned how to walk lockstep
[8:41] because you were all chained together
[8:43] and you couldn't get know where
[8:44] everybody was and in unison and so that
[8:47] was the same thing you had to learn how
[8:49] to walk and that's the same thing we
[8:50] have to learn how to progress because
[8:54] it's the same thing you know learning
[8:56] how to deal with the things that God
[8:58] wants us how he wants us to live and
[9:01] everything but it's same being a
[9:04] prisoner being coming to being fully
[9:08] surrendered to God and you know are we
[9:12] look at many things here in the
[9:14] scripture because you know you know
[9:18] brother Brown talks about in the message
[9:20] of a prisoner he talks about Paul and
[9:23] you know Paul's life and the things that
[9:25] that he had to go through and you know
[9:29] he was he was such a such a high man and
[9:32] you know had such a background and all
[9:34] these things to end up to where he was
[9:36] and you know it's easy you can see what
[9:40] in the world's view of Paul's life Paul
[9:44] was such a high man and you know he had
[9:46] everything at his at his fingertips he
[9:49] had such great training and and
[9:50] background pedigree and all of those
[9:52] things that was exactly what he needed
[9:55] and you know even brother Branham says
[9:57] you know he could have been a priest he
[9:58] could have been a high priest you know
[9:59] there was many things that was laid out
[10:00] for Paul because he was walking in that
[10:03] Avenue but you know Paul turns around
[10:06] many years later and said I count all
[10:07] that is dunk
[10:08] you know I don't count any of this as
[10:10] anything because I want to be
[10:12] apprehended by Christ I want to be under
[10:14] under the control of God and talking
[10:17] about what the grace of God was to him
[10:19] to see the life that he had lived but to
[10:22] see the life that he had lived then
[10:25] because first the life that he had lived
[10:29] was not very was not very was not very
[10:40] good in the in the realms of the eternal
[10:42] in God's plan but you know he had had
[10:45] his own way of thinking about things but
[10:47] God had to bring him to the place where
[10:48] he could see what God wanted him to do
[10:51] that was such a much of a greater thing
[10:54] and this is a first quote here from the
[10:58] message influence and brother branham's
[11:02] talking about Uzziah the king and Isaiah
[11:07] and you know he talks about the king
[11:11] being such a humble man and you know
[11:13] yeah we know how the story is that he
[11:14] was such a humble man he was such a
[11:16] great King but you know one day because
[11:18] he felt he got to the place where he
[11:21] felt like he could do his own thing that
[11:24] he stepped into the role of a priest
[11:25] which he wasn't supposed to do but you
[11:28] know what he got so comfortable in what
[11:29] he was doing as being a king and you
[11:33] know he got lifted up in his self and
[11:36] brother branham says you know and he
[11:37] said we find out as long as the King
[11:39] felt that way God blessed him but when
[11:41] he got to a place that he wanted to not
[11:43] abide in his own calling and he wanted
[11:45] to take the calling of something else
[11:47] and he thought because that God had
[11:49] blessed him that he was all right he
[11:51] could do that but how sadly we make them
[11:54] mistakes how how bad you must absolutely
[11:57] be honest you must that you mustn't do
[12:00] nothing unless God has directed you to
[12:02] do it and proves it vindicates it and
[12:04] you must that it's God that's done it
[12:07] usually a man of God God has to run him
[12:10] down and catch the real man of God ain't
[12:12] those guys that wants a lot of something
[12:15] to do a whole lot with your hard your
[12:21] hard tell what the
[12:22] would do with it if they received it see
[12:24] but God usually has to catch his man
[12:27] like Moses and Paul and like that to run
[12:30] him down to get glory out of his life
[12:32] and let him become a prisoner to the
[12:35] Holy Spirit so many times you know it's
[12:39] you know brother Graham said one time
[12:42] when he was talking about the people
[12:43] coming to the house and and the
[12:46] different things and people need in
[12:47] prayer and people asking questions and I
[12:49] believe it was at the time the man came
[12:51] to the house and he was looking for the
[12:52] audio mission and you know he was
[12:54] talking about the Millennium was
[12:55] starting and you know it's down by the
[12:57] river and you know all those type things
[12:58] and brother brems says don't ever desire
[13:01] a ministry don't ever desire anything
[13:04] like this because you know it takes a
[13:05] special kind of man to do that and not
[13:08] it not everybody and you know many
[13:10] people that tried to step in other
[13:11] people's roles and do different things
[13:14] and come to find out you know you're not
[13:15] equipped for that God didn't call you to
[13:17] do that many times people want to do a
[13:23] greater thing than then God calls you to
[13:27] do but you know the greatest the
[13:28] greatest gift that we can give God is to
[13:31] do exactly what he wants us to do is for
[13:33] him to mold our lives and for him to get
[13:36] the glory out of these things because
[13:37] you know many times there's people that
[13:39] you know they want to do something but
[13:41] you know what it's not it's not either
[13:43] the time that God wants it done or it's
[13:45] not the way that God wants it done or
[13:47] you know they want to they want to bring
[13:49] glory to themselves they want people to
[13:51] look at them but you know what God
[13:53] doesn't need any of that God wants
[13:55] somebody that is that is so humble and
[13:59] so low that you know that they can just
[14:03] walk right past and nobody knows who
[14:05] they are
[14:05] or anything like it but God can use them
[14:07] to bless his people you know there's
[14:11] many times we you know you read and hear
[14:15] of the different testimonies and things
[14:19] of what brother Brent them his life and
[14:22] you know the different people that were
[14:24] close to brother Brennaman talked about
[14:25] how humble he was and and the things
[14:27] that he done and you know how he was
[14:30] able to do things and you know people
[14:31] say they never met anymore anybody more
[14:34] humble
[14:35] him and you know it brought something
[14:37] you know but it took time for God to
[14:39] mold his character he had to go through
[14:40] many things that you know and many times
[14:43] people people want to want to carry near
[14:45] the glory or the or the you know the
[14:48] glory for that but they don't want the
[14:50] character that has to come with that and
[14:52] you know and you know many people they
[14:54] they don't ever want to have to go
[14:56] through the hardships in the battles and
[14:58] the trials to get there they don't want
[14:59] to be molded into that but they want
[15:01] they want the recognition for it and you
[15:05] know you know that kind of brother Bram
[15:08] said you know power with without
[15:11] character is satanic and many times
[15:12] people want the power you know they want
[15:14] those things but they don't want to have
[15:16] to go through through the hardships in
[15:18] the trials but you know the thing is is
[15:20] if if you plan on you know if like I
[15:22] said he had to run them down he had to
[15:25] run he had to run these people down
[15:27] you know Paul didn't all had his own way
[15:31] of thinking Paul had his own way of
[15:32] going you know Moses had his own way of
[15:35] going and all these different but you
[15:37] know God had to bring them to the place
[15:39] that he wanted them to be you know and
[15:41] every one of them had to come to that
[15:42] same place and you know you and I many
[15:44] times people look at wondering why
[15:46] things happen in their lives and and
[15:47] things like that but it's God molding us
[15:49] into what he wants us to be you know
[15:51] because you know many times there's
[15:53] there's times that things happen in
[15:56] people's lives and you know the you know
[16:00] there's like the little cartoon drawing
[16:03] of the man you know he was digging and
[16:04] digging he's trying to reach trying to
[16:06] reach the the jewels of the gold or
[16:09] whatever and you know and he keeps
[16:10] digging and digging and digging he don't
[16:12] see that he's getting anywhere but you
[16:13] know he stops right before he reaches it
[16:15] you know you're saying that he's you
[16:17] know he's getting this spawned and he's
[16:18] getting depressed he's getting down and
[16:20] don't realize that he's just a little
[16:22] bit further he'll reach the goal and
[16:24] people are starting to get you know wit
[16:26] in a weak and weary and depressed and
[16:29] despondent about things but you know
[16:30] what the goal is right in front of us
[16:32] we're not that far away you know here is
[16:35] the goal in front of and many times
[16:37] people say well you know I don't see
[16:38] what God's doing well you know the thing
[16:40] is is you keep looking and you're
[16:42] finding you know why because many times
[16:45] people keep looking through their own
[16:46] eyes they're not looking too
[16:47] as of God they don't see it in the
[16:50] scripture they want to see what external
[16:53] but they don't they're not looking
[16:54] internal because you know you can't see
[16:56] if you don't look through the eyes of
[16:58] faith if you don't look through the Word
[16:59] of God you're not going to find it
[17:01] because you know we can all look in our
[17:03] lives and all find all the faults and
[17:05] failures we can all find all the all the
[17:07] things that we're wrong you know because
[17:09] you know everybody can look and see but
[17:11] you know do you see what God sees do you
[17:15] see what God sees because you know
[17:17] there's some times in our lives that the
[17:19] Satan always wants to bring up your past
[17:21] and all these different things your
[17:22] faults and failures and you know many
[17:24] times we see that in one another
[17:26] you know because Satan saying don't
[17:28] always bring up what you've done wrong
[17:30] he'll always bring up what somebody else
[17:32] has done wrong and you know what many
[17:35] times we have people that that you know
[17:36] they find everybody else's faults in
[17:38] figures why because God you know because
[17:41] Satan wants you to see what everybody
[17:43] else is doing wrong he starts seeing
[17:44] because you're looking at things that
[17:46] you don't need to see but you know they
[17:48] would guess because you know somebody
[17:50] will say something and and people get
[17:52] upset about it and it'll just eat eat
[17:54] away at you and you know it was like
[17:58] brother Perry Greene told told the story
[18:01] one time he was talking about brother
[18:02] Branham he saw about these brothers that
[18:04] had had done these certain things and
[18:06] had cheated people and had done
[18:09] different things and brother Brennan was
[18:13] relating this stuff to Brother green and
[18:15] brother green he just the more brother
[18:18] Branham told him the harder he got and
[18:21] you know he said he said the next time I
[18:23] sell those brothers he said I'm gonna
[18:25] get him a double anointing of Texas he
[18:28] was ready to fight him and brother
[18:32] brother Brandon said later on they were
[18:33] on a trip and he said you know he said
[18:36] if we had time we'd go over and see
[18:37] those brothers and brother Green was
[18:41] like what he said after all you said to
[18:45] me and told me all about them he said it
[18:48] doesn't matter what they do he said it's
[18:50] how I treat them he said I love them no
[18:54] matter what they do they said you don't
[18:56] treat them any different and you know
[18:58] hey brother Green said that was one of
[19:01] the time
[19:01] brenton kind of kind of rebuked him
[19:04] about his about his attitude about but
[19:06] he said you know what he said he was
[19:08] talking about pastoring toussaint
[19:11] tabernacle and brother branham's was
[19:13] telling him about you know all the you
[19:17] know some of the heartaches and problems
[19:19] that he would have and he told sister
[19:20] green you know
[19:21] brother brother green's been called to
[19:23] do this but you know he said God
[19:25] equipped him to do this called him out
[19:28] there and yet said he's gonna have a lot
[19:29] of problems and you know he said I got a
[19:31] revelation one day he said it's not
[19:33] whether people love me or not he said
[19:35] it's it's whether I love them or not he
[19:37] said why because you're gonna always
[19:39] gonna have disagreements you're always
[19:40] gonna have thoughts and figures you're
[19:42] not ever always going to agree but you
[19:44] know the thing is is you cannot stop
[19:46] loving people if you have the love of
[19:49] God then you know what it's shed abroad
[19:50] in our hearts that it covers everybody
[19:52] whether they do you wrong or not because
[20:02] you know what if you're a prisoner then
[20:05] you know what you don't have your own
[20:08] you're not your own because you know
[20:10] what you do away God's doing away with
[20:12] all of that and that's what God wants to
[20:14] do he wants to do away with that because
[20:16] you know what if if you have the Holy
[20:18] Ghost than you know what the old man is
[20:19] supposed to be dead the old man is
[20:22] supposed to have died off and you know
[20:23] what we still try to resurrect him but
[20:25] we still trying to lay to the old man
[20:27] but the old man's supposed to be gone
[20:29] you know if you're a prisoner then you
[20:32] know what it should be just Jesus Christ
[20:37] that we need to be a prisoner brother
[20:41] Brown goes on here and speaking of Paul
[20:44] being a prisoner and he said I can't see
[20:47] here where Paul was forgetting anything
[20:50] saying he was sorry he was a prisoner he
[20:52] was addressing himself I believe that
[20:54] Paul is he wrote this letter with that
[20:55] pen that he was it was with the Holy
[20:58] Spirit causing him to write that maybe
[20:59] even at 2:00 this night that he might
[21:02] pull out of context start that we might
[21:04] pull out to show why Paul did this
[21:06] because it's Scripture and scriptural is
[21:08] eternal but he said he was in jail but
[21:12] that wasn't what he was speaking of this
[21:14] servant of Christ and minister with
[21:15] he was speaking that he was a prisoner
[21:17] to the word of Jesus Christ because
[21:19] Christ is the word and continuing on
[21:24] here he says and he had ambition and to
[21:28] find out that's what that great ambition
[21:30] that he had been trained for spent all
[21:32] of his life maybe from the age eight to
[21:35] ten
[21:35] growing up until about having all the
[21:39] diplomas and everything but you know God
[21:42] met him on the road to Damascus he says
[21:47] and now all that he had had trained for
[21:49] for God had took it out of him see and
[21:52] what his objective was was his father
[21:54] had spent it had spent his money for and
[21:57] the ambitions of his father and mother
[21:59] was all had been taken away from him
[22:01] because that God had something else
[22:04] therefore he was a prisoner from his
[22:06] objective that he had in life and he had
[22:08] become a prisoner to Jesus Christ who
[22:11] was the word you know the thing is as we
[22:14] become a prisoner to be taken away from
[22:19] all that but be a prisoner to Jesus
[22:21] Christ and all the things that he has
[22:23] you know if we go through the scripture
[22:26] and we start looking at things if we all
[22:28] the things that that we have you know
[22:30] brother Bentham said if you go through
[22:32] this go through this to the message and
[22:34] not through the scripture and you look
[22:35] all the things that that is not ours you
[22:39] know many times people talk about you
[22:41] know this is mine and this amount we
[22:43] won't - look look at all the blessings
[22:44] and things that are utter in there but
[22:46] you know you've ever sit down and start
[22:48] thinking about what don't belong to you
[22:49] you know the things that that is not
[22:52] ours you know if you're a prisoner you
[22:54] know because brother branham said you
[22:56] know he said it's not my righteousness
[22:58] Paul said it wasn't his righteousness
[22:59] but it was the righteousness of God he
[23:02] said it's not my goodness but it's his
[23:03] goodness he said it's not Jesus said not
[23:07] my will be done but thy will be done he
[23:10] said it's not my desire he said but it's
[23:12] his desire what are all the different
[23:14] things that we go through the scripture
[23:16] he talks about all the things you know
[23:17] all the things that don't block you know
[23:19] because I don't have a desire of mom
[23:21] we're not supposed to have a desire of
[23:23] our own we're not supposed to have a
[23:24] will of our own you know it's not it's
[23:26] not our righteousness our goodness
[23:28] nothing that we have we have nothing
[23:31] because all of it is as dirty rags
[23:34] there's nothing good in it we have to
[23:36] put all that aside and look to God
[23:38] because you know we should be just like
[23:39] a prisoner you know you don't have
[23:42] anything even the things that you know
[23:44] to get up in the morning and all the
[23:47] things that you look at all the things
[23:48] that you think you've accomplished in
[23:50] life you know if it wasn't for the grace
[23:51] of God you wouldn't accomplished
[23:52] anything it's grace of God that's
[23:54] brought all this to us you know if you
[23:56] if you go to it you know just like if
[23:58] you go to a jail or to a prison you know
[23:59] they strip everything away from you they
[24:02] take everything away from you and you
[24:04] know what and they issue you what you
[24:06] have all you know you wear you wear
[24:09] their clothes you eat their food you
[24:10] dress the way they do and everything has
[24:12] to be done their way and you know the
[24:15] thing is as many times in our lives we
[24:17] want to go back to the way it was but we
[24:19] want to try to do it our own way and you
[24:20] know what we fail in trying to do that
[24:22] but God has given us away as brother
[24:25] Graham talks about you know we try to
[24:28] come up with a better way of thinking we
[24:30] think we have a way to accomplish
[24:31] something you know what and it's an
[24:33] utter failure but you know why because
[24:35] God because we don't wait on God just
[24:39] like when he talked about Moses Moses
[24:41] was a great man of God called him to do
[24:43] a great work but you know what he done
[24:44] it in the wrong time why because he had
[24:47] been told the word told him his mother
[24:50] told him had always been told that he
[24:52] was going to deliver the people of God
[24:53] because he was a part of them and you
[24:56] know what he never waited on God because
[24:57] he thought because of his schooling in
[25:00] his education in his training that he
[25:02] was the man for the job
[25:03] but he thought he could do it on his own
[25:06] and he said he took 40 years to put all
[25:09] that Egypt had in him and it took 40
[25:12] years to get all of Egypt out of him and
[25:15] when the 40 years had passed and all of
[25:17] that had been beat out of him and had
[25:18] cleared out of him and he and he sat on
[25:20] the backside of the desert you know what
[25:22] he thought he was an utter failure and
[25:23] he couldn't do nothing he was worthless
[25:25] and he would never accomplish anything
[25:27] thence God said well now he's now he's
[25:29] in the right place that I can use him
[25:31] and then when God come down now after
[25:34] hearing all of his life said he said so
[25:36] it said on his mama's knee that he was
[25:38] been told he was the deliverer but you
[25:40] know what in the
[25:41] the midst of all of that there came a
[25:44] time that he stood in front of a pillar
[25:45] of fire and he saw that it was not being
[25:47] consumed there was a pillar of fire
[25:49] standing here before him and a voice
[25:51] speaking out of that telling him what he
[25:53] was going to do why he'd hurt all of his
[25:55] entire life and he stood there and he
[25:57] said oh I can't do it I can't do it
[26:00] while I'm not equipped but it was a
[26:03] saint but it was the same man that stood
[26:05] there and ended up with a dead Egyptian
[26:07] trying to do exactly what God wanted him
[26:09] to do it was the same man but you know
[26:14] what he had God to the place that he
[26:15] realized he couldn't do it on his own
[26:17] and when he got to that place then God
[26:19] could come on the scene and say well
[26:21] guess what you're not going to do it
[26:22] because I'm going in you I'm going with
[26:25] you to deliver the people you're going
[26:27] to do it the way that I want you to do
[26:28] it and all of the way through any time
[26:34] you know if Moses tried to do something
[26:36] his own way it was a failure but you
[26:37] know when he got to the place that he
[26:39] could listen to God and he come there
[26:40] and God told him said you deliver the
[26:42] people and even put the words in his
[26:47] mouth to say when he said I can't I
[26:50] can't speak I can't do it he said well
[26:52] that's all right he said I got somebody
[26:53] to do it for you
[26:56] he said I got a mouthpiece a name there
[26:58] and hey your brother's going to go with
[27:00] you but he went down there to deliver
[27:04] the people but you know he went down
[27:06] there but he hadn't he had thus saith
[27:08] the Lord at that time and when he had
[27:11] thus saith the Lord that he could speak
[27:12] the word and he could come to pass but
[27:14] he could do what God wanted him to do
[27:17] not before then you know many times
[27:21] people want to try to do something but
[27:23] you know if you don't do it the right
[27:24] way it's utter failure
[27:36] we come to the place you know if you get
[27:40] in the in them be a prisoner of God and
[27:44] do the things the way God wants it done
[27:47] it's glorious you know many times people
[27:51] have the have many things that come
[27:53] their way and they wonder why things
[27:55] happen the way they do and you know they
[27:57] get so beat up with with the things in
[28:00] life and you know you see people that
[28:03] you know that they never they never look
[28:05] at their condition and some people you
[28:09] know that's all they look at you know
[28:11] how you doing well
[28:13] everything's so bad you know I mean you
[28:17] can't get away from them fast enough you
[28:21] know everything everything out of their
[28:23] mouth is is is blue and sad and you know
[28:27] I mean you talked to people and I hope
[28:31] this not bad but I mean you know their
[28:34] life is like a country song I mean you
[28:36] know everything so bad and so terrible
[28:39] and I mean it you know it's just it's
[28:41] you know you just and you just can't
[28:42] stand to be around them you know you
[28:46] know you say you know if you gave them a
[28:48] million dollars they'd be complaining
[28:49] about how much they had to give to the
[28:50] government and it's like but you'd end
[28:53] up with it more than you had to start
[28:55] with but they don't see they don't see
[28:59] that they don't see that anything is
[29:00] half-full there's nothing great you know
[29:03] well you know it's a it's a beautiful
[29:05] day today yeah but it's gonna rain soon
[29:08] we're looking for the rain you can't
[29:13] stand to be around them they drive you
[29:15] nuts and you know there's some people
[29:19] you know it you know you talk to people
[29:20] and you look at their lives and you
[29:22] think man they are more I'd like to have
[29:24] their kind of life what do you see these
[29:26] people know that you're so around and
[29:27] all of a sudden you start talking to
[29:29] people and said well you know they have
[29:30] this kind of problem and they like got
[29:32] this going on and that going on and you
[29:34] know what sometimes you think boy if I
[29:35] had their life I wouldn't get out of bed
[29:37] but you know what they are the ones that
[29:39] jump up and you know what they are they
[29:41] are happy they don't let nothing get
[29:43] them down you know they keep going and
[29:46] you know you think about people are so
[29:48] amazing how
[29:49] people can can write and and do things
[29:52] and they're just so amazing how people
[29:55] were drawn to them and you know I was
[29:58] singing of there was a there was a lady
[30:01] by the name of Jenny Wilson she was a
[30:03] lady that way 1800 she wrote the song
[30:07] hold to God's unchanging hand and I was
[30:10] listening somebody tell her relate the
[30:12] story you know she did she ended up
[30:14] having a spinal condition that she lost
[30:16] the use of her legs around the age of
[30:17] three or four and she lived to be in her
[30:20] late 50s I guess or whatever but you
[30:22] know they were talking about how many
[30:23] thousands of songs that she had written
[30:25] and you know she was so happy and they
[30:27] said you know she never wrote about her
[30:30] condition in her songs you know you will
[30:33] never find a song of all the songs that
[30:36] she had written she never was down and
[30:38] out about anything you know she had she
[30:40] won because there was something that
[30:42] took place to her that you know because
[30:44] it was something that just rose up
[30:46] inside of her and you know she was she
[30:49] wrote one time about being in being in
[30:52] the wheelchair and
[30:53] and you know God coming and and bringing
[30:56] salvation her and searching her heart
[30:58] and she said there was no no greater day
[31:00] than the day that they carried her in a
[31:01] wheelchair out to the water that they
[31:03] could baptize her so she could identify
[31:05] herself with her Savior to the whole
[31:07] wide world and you know when she come up
[31:09] out of that water you know there was
[31:11] something that stirred up inside of her
[31:12] that was a wellspring that kept going
[31:14] forth and you know she just had to write
[31:16] because that was the only way she could
[31:17] express herself but you know she never
[31:19] was able to stop that flow that just
[31:22] kept coming out from her that just had
[31:24] to write songs because she just wrote
[31:25] poems everything why because there was
[31:27] something that was real to her they just
[31:29] out that flowed out from her and you
[31:32] know if it was something you know
[31:33] because you and I are the same way if
[31:34] God is the same God dwells inside of us
[31:37] that he should be and there should be a
[31:38] wellspring coming flowing forth that you
[31:41] know what it should just wash all of the
[31:42] trash out of us that we should not have
[31:45] a negative mouth we should not speak the
[31:47] devil's language we should be able to
[31:48] say the things that God said why because
[31:51] he's dwelling inside of us if we're a
[31:56] prisoner then you know what we think we
[31:58] have we should have a prisoner mentality
[32:03] one other thing that that prisoners have
[32:06] you know not only do they go and do all
[32:07] those things but you know what they they
[32:09] get to the place where you know they
[32:10] don't do anything unless they have
[32:12] permission you know they had that you
[32:16] know I used to be well you know they
[32:20] would come up there and the first thing
[32:21] they would do was you know they wouldn't
[32:22] do they wouldn't get out of bed they'd
[32:25] be asking he's supposed to do this
[32:27] whatever they didn't they didn't do
[32:28] nothing until they got permission to
[32:30] stay you know they didn't go drink water
[32:33] they didn't do nothing until they had
[32:35] permission you know if we had the same
[32:39] mentality that you know if we if we saw
[32:43] God for the things in our lives because
[32:46] if we were so in tune with God that that
[32:49] we sought him for the things that we had
[32:51] need of and the things that we ought to
[32:53] do then you know our lives would be so
[32:55] much greater we'd be so blessed because
[32:58] you know we wouldn't have the problems
[32:59] that we have we wouldn't we wouldn't
[33:01] fight some many problems you know
[33:08] sometimes we things come our way and
[33:10] then we do things and we ask the Lord
[33:11] why in the world we do that now if you
[33:14] rewind in your mind it's like well you
[33:16] know what we never did pray about that
[33:22] and now all of a sudden we wonder while
[33:25] we're in the mess we getting up with
[33:27] with a mess and then we're praying the
[33:29] Lord to deliver us as I know you got
[33:33] yourself in there let you stay there for
[33:36] a little bit and you know we have to
[33:40] struggle with things and and deal with
[33:42] things you know but there comes a time
[33:44] when God allows us to be delivered of it
[33:46] why because it's time for us to grow
[33:49] though you know we have to understand
[33:50] those things that what we've had to deal
[33:52] with that we can overcome you know it's
[33:57] just like trying to raise children you
[33:58] can you can tell them oh by the way Adam
[34:04] he always asked me what I'm gonna what
[34:06] I'm gonna preach on he keeps asking day
[34:08] way you're gonna preach oh we're gonna
[34:09] preach on that time I'm gonna preach on
[34:10] him I'm preaching on him
[34:13] I always that's what I tell him I'm
[34:15] gonna preach on you so why because you
[34:18] know what you know it's it's just like
[34:22] raising children God raising us God
[34:24] dwell you know dealing with us the same
[34:27] same kind of things but you know you can
[34:29] tell them what needs to be done and what
[34:34] you know how things ought to be and
[34:37] what's going to take place but you know
[34:38] what you you can't live that life for
[34:41] them you can't you have to let them
[34:43] experience you know many times you know
[34:49] we've had always think about brother
[34:51] Dale telling Josh it was Josh when he
[34:53] was little that the wood stove was hot
[34:55] you know
[34:56] hot hot but you know there's lots of
[34:59] times you know you you try to tell kids
[35:01] to leave things alone don't do this and
[35:02] you know after a while you got to let
[35:04] them find out for themselves you know
[35:06] because you know you can tell them don't
[35:07] do that well you know what it says you
[35:09] tell them don't they're heading for that
[35:10] I remember the first time I ever you
[35:18] know people people think it's a joke but
[35:19] I actually stuck my finger in a light
[35:21] socket one time you know I was I was
[35:25] messing with a light socket I didn't
[35:26] realize the power rizona I didn't know
[35:28] what it would do till I stuck my finger
[35:30] in there people don't leave that leave
[35:32] that stuff alone you don't know what
[35:34] you're doing
[35:34] no it looks it looks interesting looks
[35:38] cool I think I'll be all right the
[35:42] problem the problem was I completed the
[35:44] circuit and I got ahold of something I
[35:47] knew I had ahold of something and
[35:50] fortunately it did let me go but you
[35:53] know there's times you try to tell kids
[35:55] don't do stuff and you know you try to
[35:58] point them in the right direction but
[35:59] you know what the thing is is you got to
[36:01] let them go their own way you know they
[36:05] they're not going to do what you tell
[36:07] them to do and you many times you think
[36:13] of the the prodigal son you know and and
[36:16] all the things that he wanted to do and
[36:17] you know his dad tried to try to
[36:19] persuade him and tried to point him in
[36:21] the right direction but you know what he
[36:23] finally let him go his own way because
[36:24] he wasn't going
[36:26] learn he wasn't going he wasn't gonna
[36:28] follow he just says I will here you go
[36:30] you won't you want your money and you
[36:33] know you want to do your own thing well
[36:34] here you go and you know he had a great
[36:38] time for a while you know he had a great
[36:41] time and and he and he enjoyed himself
[36:43] and you know how do you lots of friends
[36:46] and all those type things until one day
[36:48] all of a sudden the money run out they
[36:50] said as soon as he run out of money then
[36:52] he run out of friends and you try to
[36:55] tell kids you know you got Fairweather
[36:57] friends in life that you know you can
[36:59] they'll come around and they'll treat
[37:01] you good for a while but you know what
[37:03] when the hard times come or things
[37:05] happen your way you know what you can't
[37:07] they can't be found they can't be
[37:09] trusted they can't be depended on you
[37:13] know many times you have people that
[37:15] come along and they want to be your
[37:16] friend they want to be so close to you
[37:18] they want to be your buddy they want to
[37:20] be everything to you but you know what
[37:21] you get around them for a little bit you
[37:23] come to find out there's a lot of things
[37:25] in their lives that's displeasing to the
[37:27] Lord and you know you'll find out those
[37:29] people want to come around and hang
[37:30] around you got to be real careful
[37:32] because they're trying to bring
[37:33] something to you the devil is bringing
[37:36] them around to get something to you you
[37:39] know because you know the first time the
[37:41] first time you have a problem in your
[37:44] life spell especially as me I can
[37:47] remember after we after as a teenager
[37:50] quit going to church and everything and
[37:52] and going to a public school
[37:54] and getting around people and you know
[37:56] what there was a lots of people that
[37:58] want to be your friend and want to be
[38:00] want to be good to you but you got to
[38:02] watch them because all of a sudden you
[38:04] start seeing spirits come up around you
[38:06] and you know it doesn't take a genius to
[38:08] see what's going on but you know
[38:10] sometimes we think well you know these
[38:12] are these are friends and you know we
[38:14] want to be part of the world and you
[38:17] know just like brother Billy Paul was
[38:20] talking to you know brother Brennan was
[38:21] telling brother Billy Paul about holding
[38:23] his arms out you know in the sign of the
[38:25] Cross and he told him said you know you
[38:27] got to go one way or the other he said
[38:29] you can't go one way and go the other
[38:31] hey you know you got to make your choice
[38:32] but he said you know I want to go this
[38:34] way he said I want to go taste the world
[38:36] I want to go see what it's like out
[38:37] there
[38:38] you know and
[38:39] you know people want it people want to
[38:41] enjoy some of that because you know they
[38:42] think it's great and on the outside but
[38:45] you know many times people think you
[38:47] know the grass is greener on the other
[38:48] side but you know after a while you find
[38:50] out they know grass over there there's
[38:53] nothing over there to be had but you go
[38:56] over there and you know then after a
[38:57] while you start looking you know and the
[38:58] next thing you know if you start
[39:00] fellowship and you start hanging out
[39:02] with these people you start having
[39:04] friends like that if you're not careful
[39:05] then you know what you end up with the
[39:07] same mentality that they have you know
[39:13] everybody you know this then you start
[39:14] doing the same things that they do you
[39:18] start living the same kind of life you
[39:20] start thinking the same thoughts that
[39:21] they do why because you're know you're
[39:23] known by the people that you associate
[39:25] with and you know here's here's this
[39:28] particle son you know he had it all
[39:30] great for a while until he ended up
[39:32] having to have him to slop hogs and he
[39:36] ended up with nothing and the Pigpen and
[39:39] the mire and all of the filth and
[39:41] everything that goes along with it he
[39:43] was down there and it said and then he
[39:44] come to his self and realized you know
[39:46] what there's people in the world that
[39:48] got it better than I've got it you know
[39:50] I had I had everything at once and now I
[39:52] have nothing and him down here in a mud
[39:54] hole and the other with these pigs and
[39:56] you know I had it so great but you know
[40:00] he decided he was gonna go home he
[40:03] wanted to go see his father he wanted to
[40:06] go back to where it was and he said he
[40:07] said father he said I have sinned
[40:11] and he said I've done everything wrong
[40:12] and and brought shame upon the family
[40:14] and everything but he said I want to
[40:16] come back and he said yeah I don't have
[40:18] to be your son he said I just want to
[40:20] come back and be able as one of the
[40:21] servants he said I just want to be down
[40:23] at the bottom he said but I just want to
[40:25] because you know what here I can be
[40:26] clean I can eat and I can have a decent
[40:29] life but you know what I don't want to
[40:31] live like that is out there and you know
[40:33] there's times people think you know
[40:34] you're trying to you're trying to
[40:36] shelter your kids and you're trying to
[40:38] protect them from something but you know
[40:39] what if you ever go out there and you
[40:41] see the things that's happened to people
[40:43] then when you see those things when you
[40:45] come back and you say well you know I
[40:47] was out in the world but I didn't do
[40:48] this and I didn't do that and
[40:49] didn't do this but you let me tell you
[40:51] what you get around those spirits and
[40:53] you may not smoke you may not drink you
[40:55] may not do a lot of things but I tell
[40:56] you what you know what you still fight
[40:58] those spirits why because when you've
[41:00] opened yourself up to those spirits and
[41:02] you know what you still bottle them
[41:03] things you still carry them around with
[41:05] you because you know there's lots of
[41:07] people that have allowed themselves to
[41:09] you know because they're not trying to
[41:11] battle and fight these Devils off
[41:13] they're not try to fight these spirits
[41:15] but they allow them to just get
[41:16] comfortable with them but the problem is
[41:20] is getting comfortable with them you
[41:22] know what you're still carrying
[41:23] something that doesn't that's I'm
[41:25] pleasing to God and you know you may
[41:29] have you may have a Christian life on
[41:31] the outside but you know what it still
[41:33] has to be what's down on the inside of a
[41:35] man but it still what's down on the
[41:37] inside of the soul because you know what
[41:38] you still have them things dealing in
[41:40] your spirit realm and people still have
[41:46] those mentality well I don't do this but
[41:48] you know what they still compromise with
[41:49] me but you know when this when the young
[41:59] man when he came back to his father you
[42:00] know his father welcomed him back you
[42:04] know he can't he came back and you know
[42:05] he was so humble that he wanted he
[42:07] didn't he didn't think that he desire
[42:09] you know that that he deserved what what
[42:11] his father gave him but you know he
[42:13] killed the fatted calf and all the
[42:14] different things you know you know the
[42:16] story of how he went through it and made
[42:18] merry and gave him the robe in the ring
[42:20] and all those different things and you
[42:21] know he was so happy that his son had
[42:23] come home you know what he didn't he
[42:27] didn't lose his place you know why
[42:28] because he was still a son he was still
[42:32] in the father's heart he still was a
[42:34] part of the father and you know what he
[42:35] came back to him and you know he still
[42:37] was gonna give him that why because he
[42:39] was a son he never lost that but you
[42:43] know he'd come back and realized you
[42:44] know how great he had it and what what
[42:46] the father had for him and then and then
[42:49] you see that the the older son had come
[42:51] and you know he wanted a while they
[42:53] having all the singing and the music and
[42:54] and all these different things and and
[42:56] you know he said well he's over because
[42:58] we're joyous because your brothers come
[43:00] home and he's standing there is like Oh
[43:03] you know you know have you read the
[43:05] scripture you know he says he said thy
[43:07] son thy son has been out doing all these
[43:10] different things and read and relish our
[43:12] --let's and all these everything's
[43:13] you're my son he didn't call him his
[43:15] brother you know hey didn't him have one
[43:20] anything have anything do with this
[43:21] brother because you know what I've been
[43:24] here the whole time I never done those
[43:27] things I have been right here and when
[43:32] have you killed a fatted calf for me
[43:38] when have you done all this for me look
[43:40] what look what I've done
[43:41] oh yeah just like this the story then
[43:47] you know Jesus was asking them you know
[43:50] when the the publican came in and the
[43:54] the scribe or whoever it was you know
[43:56] when he came in and they were praying
[43:57] and you know the one said Lord forgive
[44:00] me I'm a sinner you know and he smote
[44:02] his chest and you only had such
[44:03] repentance and the other one says well I
[44:05] thank you Lord that I'm not like him I'm
[44:08] not like him you know this guy over here
[44:10] he's like well you know what y'all have
[44:11] been more like him because you know if
[44:13] you had to look down the inside you just
[44:14] see that the man was was praying to God
[44:16] to be justified and you know God forgive
[44:20] him because like well I'm time to good
[44:22] because you know I'm just looking on the
[44:24] outside look how good I am and many
[44:27] times you know if we get to the place
[44:31] where we think we're better than
[44:32] somebody else so we have oh we have this
[44:34] we get lifted up just like you say I got
[44:37] lifted up and you know and then all of a
[44:39] sudden you know their sin in the camp
[44:41] just like Uzziah you know he got in
[44:44] place in you know they told him you
[44:45] shouldn't be doing that and you know
[44:47] what he got smoked with leprosy and he
[44:50] was he was a leper till he died but you
[44:54] know if we come to a place where we are
[44:55] more like Jesus you know if we come to
[44:58] that place Lord you know bind me Lord if
[45:02] we surrender ourselves because you know
[45:04] if it's the goodness of God that draws
[45:07] us if he draws us then you know that we
[45:10] come to him and like Lord I want to be
[45:12] free but I want to be bound to you I
[45:14] want to be bound to the
[45:15] I want to be bounded thus saith the Lord
[45:17] I want I want to be just as much as
[45:20] close to you as I can be I want to be
[45:23] bound to what you want me to be bound to
[45:25] I want to be just molded like you want
[45:28] me to be because if that's what we
[45:31] desire then that's what God can do but
[45:35] you know we have to do away with all of
[45:36] our ambitions and and all of these
[45:38] things but you know God is here to move
[45:40] all of those things from our lives to
[45:42] make us what we won't want him to be but
[45:46] you know you know the people that that
[45:48] have a lot of problems is is people that
[45:52] that go to you know you go to you go to
[45:55] prison and you know they're trying to
[45:58] put you in there and they try and tell
[46:01] you how everything's supposed to be and
[46:02] you know there's a border and there's a
[46:04] system for everything and ask to go in
[46:05] there and you know many times people go
[46:07] in there and and they don't want to do
[46:09] that they don't want to do the things
[46:10] that has to be done you know they only
[46:12] do so much and then they're out causing
[46:13] problems and you know they're trying to
[46:15] sneak around and get by with this and
[46:17] this and you know you know how they do
[46:18] and you know all about prison you know
[46:21] how they you know they always have stuff
[46:23] going on and different things like yeah
[46:24] we don't when you get called they got a
[46:26] place to put you you know they find out
[46:29] where you know what you've done to
[46:30] everything like that well you don't
[46:31] listen they just stick in solitary they
[46:34] got a little place where they put you in
[46:36] there and you know you got you got your
[46:38] little caught in your little blanket and
[46:39] they keep you in there and you're in
[46:40] there by yourself for a while and you
[46:43] stay in there till you get till you get
[46:45] ready and then they'll decide if they
[46:46] only look to you bring you out if you're
[46:47] gonna do what you need what needs to be
[46:50] done are you gonna follow the right kind
[46:52] of plan and you know it's just like
[46:55] brother Brown was talking about the one
[46:58] time the the sister that had gotten sick
[47:02] and you know brother branham had had
[47:03] told him that she was going to get well
[47:05] and then later on you know she died
[47:08] brother branham come to Lord said well
[47:09] you owe me an explanation why did you
[47:12] tell me that she was gonna live as she
[47:13] died and then you know God just let him
[47:17] sit under that for a while you know he
[47:19] just sat there for a while you know God
[47:20] didn't deal with him hey you know you
[47:22] know he said to just you know just kind
[47:25] of left out on his own for a while
[47:27] why because you know he coming there got
[47:29] his law attitude brought it in there
[47:31] well you know what God kind of put him
[47:32] in his own little solitary little cell
[47:34] over there and said well you just said
[47:35] under that for a while but you don't
[47:37] when he come back then he realized you
[47:38] know what God you don't owe me an
[47:40] explanation you don't owe me nothing and
[47:43] God told him said listen said a year ago
[47:46] that lady should have died she should
[47:49] have drowned in the river and they
[47:51] pulled her out and it was the goodness
[47:53] of God that saved her life and brought
[47:55] her back and she was able to repent and
[47:58] get right with God before she passed in
[48:01] too many times we won't we won't know
[48:02] what why God does things you know what
[48:05] God doesn't owe us an explanation you
[48:07] know why because his judgments are right
[48:09] his judgments are true
[48:11] they're pure they're correct and if God
[48:14] gives us something than you we oughta
[48:16] raise them so well thank God
[48:17] why because you allowed me to go through
[48:20] that and you know what's good for me and
[48:21] whether I see it or not I know that it's
[48:23] good you know there was a there was a
[48:28] man we told totally to a lady one time
[48:31] and you know she was all upset about
[48:33] things and and you know the man told her
[48:35] said well you know the Bible says that
[48:36] all things work together for the good so
[48:39] I don't know why I don't know what good
[48:40] comes out of it but I know that's what
[48:42] the Bible says the Bible says that all
[48:44] things work together for the good to
[48:46] them that love the Lord who are the
[48:47] called according to his purpose so you
[48:50] know what if that's what happens and you
[48:51] know what isn't there some kind of good
[48:53] in and if I don't see the good well I
[48:54] don't I'm not looking the right way but
[48:57] you know what God will show me the right
[48:58] way but show me that it's good but you
[49:00] know right now I know that it's good why
[49:02] because that's what the word says it's
[49:03] good whether I'm you know I can see it
[49:07] or not that doesn't have anything to do
[49:08] with it but Kendra but do we believe in
[49:12] believing holding into the word and
[49:15] being a prisoner being a prisoner be
[49:18] what God wants us to be can you can you
[49:21] be a prisoner I want to be a prisoner
[49:25] there's many things like I get into nut
[49:27] but I kind of keep it short but I just
[49:31] want to say I'm you know I won't want to
[49:34] be a prisoner I want I want to be molded
[49:36] the way he wants me to be molded you
[49:38] know there's so many things when you
[49:39] start when you start thinking of songs
[49:42] you know you know when you when you
[49:44] start thinking of a prisoner mentality
[49:46] when you start singing songs you know
[49:48] there's so many songs that that I that
[49:53] come to mind here I want to live the way
[49:55] he wants me to live you know there's a
[49:58] song I'm a prisoner of love I'm a slave
[50:01] to the master
[50:02] I'll exceedingly toll through the heat
[50:04] and the cold all the different songs
[50:06] that come to your mind when you when you
[50:07] think about that I'm not in my own I
[50:10] belong to Jesus he purchased me I'm all
[50:13] he's bought with a price the blood of
[50:16] Jesus I'm not my own I'm here when you
[50:20] start to think about those things and
[50:21] you start to see you know what because
[50:24] if you want to see the great things of
[50:26] God in your life you want to see then
[50:28] you know what all you've got to do is
[50:29] become a prisoner you've just got to
[50:32] come to a place where you realize that
[50:34] it's not you but it's him I want to be
[50:37] what he wants me to be I want I want him
[50:39] to take full control because you know
[50:41] what if he takes control then you know
[50:43] what it'll it'll go the way it needs to
[50:45] go as a song says something the water
[50:48] some through the floods some through
[50:50] great trials but all through the blood
[50:51] some through great sorrow but God gives
[50:54] a song in the night season and all the
[50:56] day long why because you know what it
[50:58] doesn't matter what God brings our way
[50:59] you know what if we're a prisoner then
[51:01] we know that it what God is leading us
[51:03] the right way but are we completely sold
[51:05] out to God's plan are we completely sold
[51:08] out it is is it that that God are we
[51:10] allowing the Holy Spirit to come and
[51:12] clean out everything in our lives that
[51:14] sound pleasing Lord just clean us up and
[51:16] just clear us out Lord and you clear our
[51:18] minds and our thinking Lord that it just
[51:21] thinks the thoughts of God Lord that we
[51:22] can just that we're just speaking us as
[51:24] brother Bob was talking about speaking
[51:26] the Oracles of God become an Oracle of
[51:29] God why because being being the voice
[51:31] because if the word comes in and the
[51:33] word goes out you know God didn't call
[51:36] us to just be vessels just just to just
[51:39] to be filled up but you know we're to be
[51:41] vessels ain't useful you know you just
[51:42] don't put a vessel in use just to fill
[51:44] it up and set it on a shelf but you know
[51:46] what we are to be the ones to go out to
[51:49] the world that's lost and die and let
[51:51] them see Jesus Christ to be poured out
[51:53] before
[51:53] the people that they can be seen who
[51:55] Jesus Christ yes it's not it's not just
[51:58] that we're going to be a vessel to be
[52:00] set on the Shelf where we can look
[52:02] pretty or anything but you know what
[52:03] it's to be a minister
[52:05] for us to you know and it's not just
[52:07] standing behind the pulpit administered
[52:08] but it's to go out and do what God has
[52:11] called us to do you know sometimes you
[52:15] know I think about you know brother Dale
[52:17] talks about people you know we don't
[52:19] have a lot of what we used to what we
[52:22] call prayer warriors years ago but you
[52:24] know there's so many times and you go
[52:27] back and you read people and you see
[52:28] things that's happened to people you
[52:30] know what people actually you know I
[52:32] think it's I think it's something that's
[52:33] totally lost in the church because
[52:35] people people have just gotten away from
[52:37] that and you know if you ever get back
[52:39] to that place and you know I think God
[52:41] if we ever get back to the place where
[52:43] we could actually just pray and just
[52:45] seek your face you know even the
[52:46] scripture says that he'll hear from
[52:48] heaven but all the things that God done
[52:50] with people all the different things you
[52:52] know that you know it's even when like
[52:54] how about the West revival and different
[52:56] things that's happened what wasn't even
[52:57] when people got right with God when
[52:59] people got a does burning desire within
[53:01] the heart and you know what they salt
[53:03] the face of God then you know what
[53:04] happened God came down and he met them
[53:06] and he ministered to them people say oh
[53:11] I want a revival well you know what the
[53:13] thing is the revival starts seeing you
[53:17] and we ever get to the place we get to
[53:21] the place we will let things that the
[53:24] world and all the things that that
[53:27] happened you know we got to live here
[53:29] but you know the thing is is many times
[53:31] if you if you ever desire to do
[53:33] something within you know what then the
[53:35] devil is coming there and he's gonna be
[53:36] mad he's gonna mess it up how are you
[53:38] going to try to do something for God
[53:39] he's there to mess it up
[53:41] and you think well you know I want to do
[53:43] this and I want to do that well you know
[53:45] what this to remember whatever you do
[53:46] the devil's there he's gonna fight you
[53:50] but you got to fight we got to fight
[53:54] there's a fight on our hands but you
[53:56] know what the thing is this greater is
[53:58] he that sent us then he that's in the
[54:00] world do you have that desire tonight I
[54:04] want I wanna I wanna I wanna
[54:07] so much like him the world can't tell us
[54:09] apart there's a that old song you know I
[54:14] want to be so much so I want to be more
[54:17] like him every day why because you know
[54:20] there's a time that you know it's not
[54:23] you know not just looking for the law
[54:24] the last one because you know what we
[54:26] don't know when that last one comes in
[54:28] but you know the thing is is the last
[54:29] one comes in but you know what every
[54:31] single person in the body of Christ has
[54:33] got to be in their place it's not just
[54:35] when the last one comes in but it's when
[54:37] every person in the body is in their
[54:39] position and I want to be one where I
[54:42] you know it's not somebody waiting on me
[54:44] I want to be the one that's in my place
[54:46] I want to be whatever it is I want to be
[54:47] where where is this if it's a dorm out
[54:50] in the house of God or whatever is I
[54:51] swear I want to be I want to be what God
[54:54] has me I want to be faithful to the
[54:56] calling that God's called me - it's not
[54:59] about big eyes and little use it's being
[55:01] faithful one because you know if you
[55:03] have if you have this if you have the
[55:06] Holy Ghost if you have the Spirit of God
[55:08] in you then you know what all your
[55:09] desire is is to is to be used of God to
