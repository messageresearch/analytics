to think about it 24 years ago the 98 21 years ago no okay 21 he's no say richard.reimers I don't he's just trying to remember how many years ago it was but it's been quite a few but had a wonderful time and got to see some of the some brothers and sisters hadn't seen in quite some time and had a wonderful time and Lord really moved believe it really touched some of the young people there really moved in their lives and I believe some of them received the new birth there and had quite a few testimonies and everybody wants wants me to get they just go out this doing okay it's not like he just went out but anyway so I'm gonna tell tell a little bit about my experiences later but didn't want to did want to say that the on the way down brother Matthew braid got us a room in and mobile so Levon totally by he had two choices about going to Louisiana camp this year he could go the easy way or the hard way but he went the easy way but you know I think it's a wonderful thing for young people to go and experience and like we got the mobile spent the night somebody broke in my truck and they stole my laptop my GPS and few other things but just wanted to say that they didn't get my they didn't get my Bible my tablet here so thank the Lord for that and they didn't get my pistol for some reason they left they got in the console this was laying on top of my pistol they opened the console they pulled this out they pulled the pistol out they laid the tablet back in there and close the lid and then they left the pistol and in the passenger floorboard but they stole my laptop so but I was thinking I was telling some of the brothers down there it's like well I remember about brother colleagues rifles getting stolen and we called for it and they came back and I told myself scene garden do bigger things than that besides returning a laptop and so he's the same yesterday today and forever so y'all just notice continue to pray but it's nothing's too hard for God and so I just believe it'll it'll turn up and I don't know where it's at but God knows and God knows how to bring it back so sister Esther if you want to come and start we're gonna start with her and get the rest of the young people so to start off my testimony I'm gonna go ahead and thank poppy and nany for providing us with the money to go to this camp so when you're going to a meeting about to get a blessing you know the devil is gonna come around and be like no you're not getting anything so that's what he tried to do to me and I knew it was him so I was like I'm not gonna listen to you but in the back of my mind I was still worried like you know what if I don't get anything so uh I get there I go through the prayer line and stuff and I don't really feel anything and so the devil is like see you don't feel anything you didn't get anything but it wasn't really till after the camp when usually I would start wanting to do the things I used to do and I realized I didn't want to do those things anymore God took that desire out of my heart so it doesn't emotions don't really matter it's the desire taken out of you that is what counts so I just want to thank God for that Olivia will get Josiah next so first I do want to thank the church and poppy nanny for letting us go to this camp and I wanted to thank brother homeless church for providing a way to go to the cam and I wanted to start by saying with I went to camp with a couple things on mind I put a Perry requesting well a month ago for a friend named Christian he was struggling with health problems and he had a recently go to the doctor because he had cancer and so he doesn't have anymore cancer but he hasn't been able to eat for two months without vomiting or throwing something up so I went to camp with him on my mind and whenever I got back from camp he told me that he has been able to eat without going up like for the past about week now so I really wanted to thank that and how I could tell was the first night of camp there's first service that we went to at all ok the first service that we went to I prayed for him and I just felt like this feeling that he was healed and that he couldn't get hurt again by whatever he had cuz the doctors didn't know what he had and a couple days later he told me that he's been able to keep down his food and it was that day that he felt better that day that minute that I prayed for him and I thought that was great I like to start out by thanking the church for letting us go pop your nanny and her brother's home her church for letting us drive down there and I like to I received a personal blessing from brother Andrew Glover and brother Donnie who preached there they put they preached amazing services on mechanics and dynamics and just how God can help you in your darkest times and I would seize the blessing from camp and one of the biggest points throughout camp was don't just if when you receive something from God don't leave it at camp don't leave it in Louisiana just take it home with you so thank you everyone [Applause] yes I want to thank the church for rosedale my own these people the gun people to go and I also want to say I appreciate all the prayers for everybody praying for them I know people around the world you know some of other countries that have been there and you know they send their greetings to the young people at camp and tell them you know even though we're not there we're still praying for you and it was it's just a really a blessing but just want to give have a little testimony to give about the but the prayer line every every Saturday night that they have a prayer line and and have all the ministers come and you know all week they they preach on having on having faith and and claiming what God has given you and it was just it was an amazing amazing thing I was I was blessed by the word but you know it's it's it's a blessing to see somebody else get blessed and and to see the kids you know some of them just like Esther and number talking about so many of them come questions and the devil just you know just really beats on them and you know they're coming to get a blessing and the devil fights them all the way and you know some of them they have a lot of questions in their minds and in their hearts when they get there but you know the thing is is you just start trusting God and you know you listen to the word go forth and you know to build faith and and you know the promises of God are yeah and amen they and they're yours and all you have to do is claim them but I just want to give everybody want me to talk about the the prayer line so I just want to briefly talk about that just about everybody there seemed like it went on forever but it was it was a blessing but there were three people that come through the prayer line that we dealt with that had demons and they were cast out while they while we were there and and to see that and a lot of young people who had never seen anything like that before had never experienced anything like that but you know it was one thing that brother Andrew was talking about was you know you start to see that those spirits are real and brother Brent I'm talking about those spirits and you know people just we've heard a lot of people talk about the ministry talk about it and we've heard brother Branham talk about it everything like that but it's but it comes to a point where you actually see those things manifest it changes your outlook and your because you know those spirits are regal that you're fighting a real spirit but the thing is is the Spirit of God is just is greater than that he's just as real as that we don't see in that other realm but but it's really there and a lot of people think was just some kind of hocus-pocus or or something like that but you start dealing with that and then all of a sudden people start I mean they the kids were a lot of the kids were had never seen anything like that and they had were really talking about what they had had seen but anyway there was there was three people that come through the line and the first lady that that came to his life she came with her husband because the prayer line is open to anybody in the anybody there at the meetings so we prayed for parents grandparents everybody but this lady she came through and she as soon as she got in the the beginning of the prayer line I was out back toward the end and as soon as she came through I don't know if anybody's ever dealt with spirits if you've ever seen a demon brother branham said you ever see how somebody's countenance changes when dealt when the devil is about to be exposed and if you ever seen that take place you can see them in their eyes their countless changes sometimes their eyes bug out sometimes their eyes roll back in their head they they jerk and contort I mean it's just an amazing thing that people what was going on but you know we she was just all up all over the place and they were they were praying for her but they got her down on the floor after she was all over the brothers were trying to hold him to her and pray for it she was going kind of ballistic there and she after they finally got her down they started talking to her and they started speaking to that spirit and you know they had to call it lots of times you'll see somebody when this takes place you know their eyes roll back in their head or whatever and if you call their name and you speak to them you speak to that spirit and you tell them you let them come through youto and then you all of a sudden they'll come the person is back there and you can talk to them but the thing is is you've got to get the person that's bound by the spirit you've got to get that person to confess and cast that spirit out the Bible says in my name shall they cast out devils well that's not the preachers having to do that that's the person that's bound it's got to get to the point to cast the spirit out but we they dealt with her for quite a while we prayed for over 30 minutes with her and then the finally some of the brothers took her off the back room and they continued to pray for her and she was delivered after the service but they can the brothers continue to pray for her but there was another young lady that was a I would say she was about 18 years old and I don't know what it was but as soon as she got in the prayer line it was just just manifesting and her and it was really fighting the brother and everything and they were just trying to hold on to her and just they were praying and casting that thing out and it wasn't it wasn't long it was maybe 10 minutes or something but anyway she just fell to the floor like a box of rocks I mean she just hit the floor hard and the thing was gone and when she when she came back to herself she was fine but there was a there was a little black brother he come through the prayer line and as when he came through one of the brothers that was was there he called he called a spirit on him and this this brother he just walked through the prayer line but the brother caught the spirit and he watched him leave the platform well we finished we finished the prayer line and then it started that manifest started acting up and one of the brothers had had mentioned to brother Tim Pruitt about it well I didn't see I didn't hear what was going on I just happened to see something was going on well by the time we got over there the brother was in one of the chairs at the second row and his head was down between his knees I thought he had passed out or he was sick or something I didn't realize what was going on and they didn't say anything to us so anyway we just started making her way over to where he was but that's when when the what was so amazing was when he went down and passed out or whatever in the chair all these boys that are from his dorm like 13 to 15 years old all these brothers that were around him all these young men they went over and they were the ones praying for him when the minister's got over to where he was and so when we come over there one of the brothers was trying to talk to him and trying to revive him well the brother that had seen the spirit they said I seen you sniggered and everything he said I seen that spirit and he said I walked over and he started talking to him well when we got there and that brother started talking to him then that thing started coming out and then that was the one that we saw that actually spoke to us and I was standing there and I was closer about half the distance between me and brother Kali and that thing was talking and you know it was they tried to talk to him they asked what they the brother knew what kind of spirit it was he said you're you're a spirit of and he said yes the spirit answered but they showed him a picture of the pillar of fire brother had it on his phone he showed it to him and he showed him a picture of the pillar fire he said this is a manifestation of your Creator and I thing wouldn't look at it would look at the picture of pillar fire kept turned his head and he said you look at me and all of a sudden that spirit looked at that looked at that brother and he said this is a manifestation of your Creator and he said yes I had a real deep voice to be spoke but it was it was an amazing thing that a lot of those kids had never seen anything like that but you know they kept the they got the brother to start reading the scripture in quoting the scripture it's because you know you have to make this thing leave and so when they started asking this brother and they started giving him the scriptures to read and he said that things would just come up and start messing with his mouth and contorting and and they would say you be quiet and let him speak and it would come right back and he would start speaking but we prayed for him for quite awhile but he finally he finally was able to cast that thing out but we just kept praying for him and praying for him but it was him speaking and him telling it and afterwards I have to late after they dismiss because he come up front and said he was free from that spirit and then when he left we had walked out and some of the brothers had went with him outside and was walking him back to his dorm well by the time he got to his dorm me and brother Jonathan Jones some of y'all know brother Jonathan we were outside walking I seen him in the distance sitting in front of his dorm and I seen that spirit coming back and he was act just contorting and and getting all educated everything there was a brother Center trying to talk to him and I walked back over and we were talking to him but it was manifesting he was fighting him and so brother Jonathan some of those other brothers we took him back to the church back to the back room and sat him down in a chair and he kept trying to we kept trying to talk to him to have faith and the thing is for him to confess he needed to confess and every things in his life that he didn't that he needed to confess and he finally just started talking to us and they said well the thing is I see it's not when you as soon as you expose Satan Satan has no power if you have if there's fear and there's a few things I want to only share well after after he'd done that and he was free we prayed for him and it was free of that one of the brothers said okay so we're gonna take you get baptized because you've repented there you get baptized because the only way you're gonna keep that thing away from you is to receive the Holy Ghost you need the Holy Ghost and he said well I've already been baptized and they said well we're gonna go get baptized again so we took him down to the water and the brother baptized but he said the next morning off all three of them were free of their spirits those unclean spirits had been passed but I just got a couple of things here I don't want to share with you number one the one thing that brought him and all the ministers always talked about even brother Branham don't confess sin those spirits are gonna stay right where they are as long as there's unconfessed sin that's the main thing is wrote em said don't even get in the prayer line if you gotta get you have unconfessed sins you need to get rid of that first and then you can come in here because they're gonna stay there as long as as long as you don't confess but the main thing is confess God's Word and put out and confess whatever because you know the thing is is people say well I don't have any unconfessed sin but you there was a sister one time the lady come to brother Branham and she thought she was all right until brother Branham said y'all seen the railroad tracks in the car and everything like don't you mention that said I confess that a long time ago I was like yeah but you didn't confess it God wasn't the one you sinned against it was your husband you sinned against and you need to go make that right so you see a lot of times when those things come about all of a sudden people start to talking about things that they don't want to talk about because that's what that's what confess sins in your life as those things that are hidden then all of a sudden when the Holy Ghost comes you'll start bringing those things you remember it's what you need to make right and and the other thing is is to empower the people to be the one to cause the Spirit to flee you know it's not the ministers this like there was a brother I was talking to after the at the meeting and he said that brother Tim Pruett has instructed his ministers on this but the thing is as I was a sister came one time and she said the spirit they cast the demon out ever and it was you know she was so afraid it was gonna come back and they kept telling her sister we didn't cast it out you did and said the only thing that changes in all of this is your is your location you're here but when you go home God's Word don't change you've already cast him out so you had faith to show because gods are proved to you that this spear to leave you you have the faith God's Word don't change the Holy Ghost don't change the only thing that changes is your location because if he's done it once he'll do it again the only thing is you got to have faith to believe that he'll take care of that the other thing that I thought was amazing is the number of ministers a number of brethren that are around that have battled all these spirits that you can think of depression drugs alcohol even pornography that God has delivered and these brothers are the ones that come and pray for these young people it's so amazing because some of these kids say I battling this and I'm battling that and then brothers are standing there saying you know what God delivered me of that 13 15 20 years ago God delivered me of that and some of these brothers that have battled these spirits I have to tell you they're very zealous about what they do they're almost militant about what they do because they've been delivered of those spirits and those spirits still tacking to the young people they have a real burden on their heart for the young people and that's what amazed me was I was really blessed to see that because you know those kids are stand there sometimes they think they're there on the island all by yourself but you know what there's brothers standing there hey I've battled this I know what it's like and you know what God delivered me and you know what he's the testimony so it was it was really amazing and you know the one thing is is thing I want to say is fear is the way back is the devil is that the devil is looking for an avenue back in your life after the devil you cast a spirit out he's looking for a way back and fear is the way that he finds his way back because that's what some of those kids happen is because they get fearful after that thing leaves and the devil comes back well you know what if you start dwelling on fear and not dwelling on faith and that's the devil's Avenue to come back on here but I'm so glad that you know a lot of people have gotten to see those things that are real and they come upon us but you know what greater is He that's in us than he that's in the world Amen let's all stand this everything I'm sorry I didn't I was trying to be brief on this but it really it really touched my life and I thank God that the kids have a these young people have an opportunity and there's people out there that have a real burden for the young people to to be blessed and touched so let's sing open eyes of my heart Lord is brother Dale comes as everything open [Music] open the eyes of my open the eyes of my heart do you to see hi [Music] shining in the light of your pour out your power and glory shining in the lot of you be loving power [Music] amen [Music] holy a man a man and a man I want to see him not you then appreciate our youth would always be with them and learned a lot of things from these camps and things that they do too in this approach the Lord would always bless those that are trying to put forth those efforts to do those things to help the children and think in their doing they meant just remember a way of announcement wage is probably on the way back in this evening from brother Duchess so remember that remember brother Aaron will be ministering Wednesday remember the Bible study will be this coming Saturday the fellowship meeting will be the third Saturday in May so remember all of these keep in your hearts brother Addison still having trouble with his back and brother Donnie and he had been to the emergency room or to a doctor and then today they took him back so maybe we can have some rapport get something back after a while to find out how he's doing but he's been this a lot of diarrhea and this gets better and then it goes back and so you know he's lost us like I said 11 pound in three days or something like that so just you know prayer to the Lord would reach down and touch him and deliver him of all things like turning you scripture turned back where we read this morning from Ephesians 2 will try to pick up our thought and continue on on what we're talking on on salvation father we thank you for this day and your love thank you for everything thank you for being with the young people Lord and helping them and giving them understanding and Lord to see the natural things of life and a lot of the situations and it'll help them in their own spiritual understanding that they might walk in you and Lord we ask you to just bless each one remember brother did our Lord this back problem and brother Donny just reach down touch him and we're waiting them all the way back home remember all of these that are sick among us because we believe you and we thank you you said you sent your word and healed us and delivered us from destruction so just have your way now as we read your word you come and speak to our hearts and let your loving grace be with each one in Jesus name I mean Ephesians 2 beginning with verse 5 even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ by grace you are saved and hath raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus that in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of His grace in his kindness toward us through Jesus Christ for by grace now remember up here what we read where it says by grace you're saved now let for by grace are you saved through faith then he's brought his point he laid it down it were sitting in heavenly places and everything and that we were saved by grace but now he adds a point to it too for us to understand for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of God not of works lest any man should boast you may be seated the Lord and His blessing to the reading of the word now what was our point we tried to make the point this morning of one thing we say oh I'm saved I know I'm saved you can't tell me I ain't saved well oh why are you concerned about it right why are you concern what was the problem you know if you're saved who you're trying to convince yourself or me it doesn't do much good to try to convince me cuz it wouldn't have anything anyway but see our point was what we we do I believe the Christian thing is not just a one-time thing it happens and you believe in 90 years later you're still as I believer you know I believe that the Christian life is a life of faith it's a walk that is in a journey you know that in what we do and how we live and things that Christian journey is unfolding and we're walking day by day not just I said one thing we come to church and then never come back no more or never have no more anything you know we just well I'm saved and then when they die we put everybody in the heaven you know and say well they're saved well that might be true but what would you say from and how does it work all right so we're talking about and the title or thought will be for a couple of services on salvation all right and I like that part that I was mentioning he says that you're saved by faith but there's more to it than to just say saved by faith it's one he's not just saying my face in through faith through faith a journey but you're your Christian journey is what justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost that's a journey how many of you remembers that journey we may have thought we were this or thought we were that but after coming into the truth of the hour see I look back and I remember my life and I remember when I started my Christian journey little Baptist Church you know and going forth and saying I accept Jesus Christ as my savior and then watching that unfold down through my life as I began to proceed on in my Christian journey and I begin to be a you know more concerned about my life about the way that I do in a hacked and the things and you know if I'm going to be a Christian I remember that that my thought was if I'm going to be a Christian I need to know what the Bible says because that should be the first thought you know so I set out to read the Bible and and to try to understand and I can remember it going through in my life and and that word that I began to read it began to take out a lot of my wrong calls and desires and points of life that I had you know doing and deeds and actions and and things like that and it just kept on will see the problem was that was as far as I could get dire because I didn't have anybody know more to Dyer to help you know move on because you know I would try to talk to people about salvation and they just kind of well I think you need to go to a to a Pentecostal church that's what one one Deacon told me one time you know and I think you need to go to Pentecostal church because in other words I talked about something he didn't know much about and he was encouraging me to go somewheres else come you know he was honest and sincere all right misty I didn't get the baptism of the Holy Ghost I come in this message but I thought I had it like all the rest I was thought and concerned I believe I had something I believe that brought me to where I was because I depended upon it but it wasn't over with all at once see even I was raised up in a church that through the badness that you get everything when you believe and I quote scripture where it said believeth and is baptized you know it wouldn't just believe to me it wouldn't just well I'm in the church I'm this I'm that or the other I had a desire in my heart to know more about God and then that desire I begin to call out to others and I found some who were interested in Okin and some that wouldn't but anyhow I believe I had something to direct me it may have been justification sanctification but it was salvation because that's what we look at we might we say you know well this that or the other and we try to to talk about our point of salvation let's see your salvation begins when you believe huh and that's that's what you ought to consider it and you're in a journey in your life day by day is a constant journey of a Christian life and it all should be done upon the basis of her faith all right now then what we were talking about this morning it was what now then that you're saved by grace through a journey of a Christian life saved by grace through faith all right now getting that part is to see that we we should never think about ever stopping it should never be the thought in a Christians mind or anything about stopping brother Brennan said Paul was the kind of person they wanted to always be moving he didn't mean moving and building from this place to that place or the moving in God to carry what he believed you know to others well that should be our desire we sit out of the desire in our heart to to you know want to walk in the word and let it unfold we know a lot about the world and in books and magazines and this better the other way but how much do we know of the Bible well see it's not the journey of a what you call it Webster's definitions or anything it's a journey of a Christian that we're talking about through faith through your life and you're doing can you remember that has your has your Christian understanding has your part of the world has it developed and I don't mean now just able to read I know I don't mean that now I know I don't mean see that's what most people think being a Christian is is to being able to memorize the Bible or what the people with photographic memories got it over us right this knots how much you know is how much has been revealed to you now that's what we got to deal with this afternoon so we're going to talk about faith all right how much of it has been revealed I would to God that I had revealed to me the amount of word that my mind has been able to capture me you know let it be in me and I want that desire I've always had a desire for growth you know a development in my Christian experience I've never satisfied I'm not satisfied now to to think about I've preached things that you know that a lot of people have never tried to preach but that's to me that's part of my Christian journey I want something real all right and see faith then is what Hebrews 11:1 I'm is right faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen now have you ever been to where God reveal something to you I mean you know he might something known to you know when he reveals that to you it's something real it's the substance you can't show it as looking at some of the things brother Ron said you can't show your faith oh yes I showed my faith you ll alright so does everybody else you know you understand what I'm saying you can't show your faith you can't take it out and show it you can't show what's causing you to be what you are your life yeah up or down but people's lives are up and down you know people live a good life they're people in your neighborhood maybe you think they wouldn't in a lot of ways live a better life than we do more concerned and more you know of Christianity we had a lady that I remember in the Baptist Church that she said I won't make my bed in the morning if I could get an opportunity to go talk to somebody about the Lord well cc/minute she was sincere she was you know I don't have no problem of thinking she was just doing that to try to convince me I think she minute course she lived a good life you know one time and you remember a lot of people that you're around that live live good lives some that are not even Christian lives good lives and they're just you know everything I'm like brother Forney I don't like that Wow see Wow see down and out you know everything I have enough trouble as it is I don't have to get down and out about it I want to stay up and keep going because that's part of go that's part of my journey you know I've studied this message now for 50 years well I work to at least be able to remember a little of it right that's what you are I mean you studied it that's part of your experience is studying this message reading the message and taking it to see what God can reveal to you you know how that we do it a lot of times we say well I read that and studied that but city revealed it to me the other day well if you know what a revelation is and listen this is west way to say it you don't know what a revelation is if you never had one now that's the best way for me to say it if you've never had one you don't know what a revelation is if somebody can take away from you out argue out quote out do or whatever if they can take that away from you you don't even know revelation now a lot of the intellect might look good but if they can take it away from you that's not a revelation because we're talking about in the city Hebrews 11:1 that faith is the substance all right now here is our whole key to what we're talking about how my notes is doing no good I'll just leave them alone all right is your God real or is he just your thoughts is he just your imagination or your point or is he real well you say you believe in one true and living God right now is there any way that somebody could deprogram you and and take away from you the revelation of Jesus Christ if there is you didn't have it the I believe in a Salvation that is real because the God that I believe in is real didn't I can depend upon what he says because he's trying his best to get me to see something about that is real alright do you have know Satan can come and give us doubts and thoughts come on now listen he can make us this away that way down and out up and he can do all kind of things right when you think you got everything defeated you better realize you're fixing to get slapped down because it's not gonna work that way that's not God's Way of doing it oh I like what brother Gary Atkins used to say he said God knows how to raise children you know I mean we got it we got kids and we doing a pretty face that little eyeball you don't pee and this oh they cried and they just touch our heart right we'll see God don't deal like that you're heading the stage shut up sit down we're acting like a little baby oh my god don't do like that my guard is sweet and soft and mellow and well I'm sorry to tell you you ain't got the God I'm talking about you don't have the god of the word all right you may have your God but that's not the god of the word see sometimes they just tell you just shut up No quit crying get up home you know all right we get so down and out until we thank God has left us we're just in the valley of you know problems of the I think we have a sister no that's that's not a sister she's been here before okay I only look around and I miss people you don't I don't want to be to her that I don't see people yeah all right but now listen how real and the seriousness and what I'm talking about because I believe that your salvation is as real as your God now that's the way I believe salvation I believe it's just as real as God is called god is my salvation it's not just a thought or a concept that's what most people have about God they just have their own thoughts their own concept or on do about the eternal God what's not in it God is real I spent all of my old Christian but almost 40 years now trying to preach how real God is I make this statement now I love you to remember it when I make it I said one of these days I'm gonna preach on the Godhead if I ever get it settle down enough you said my lord you've been preaching 40 years on it that's what I mean I've been preaching 40 years old ain't got it done yet I'm just getting started I just see him unfold itself and how real he is and I know for a certainty that my salvation is based upon whether or not my God is real well I just you know I just believe these ain't just you know he's just as good he's this that they talk about that I'm talking about a god that has substance or is the substance a better way of saying it not a substance he's real he's more real than you are and I certainly know you're real well then my God is more real than anything I could think of all right God faith is the substance right now Webster says the substance is what anything consist off to be a substance it has to have some something that makes it better way if not it's just your thoughts all right yeah a substance can be walked on right well God is real now how real is your God then we get all down and out because things don't work our way but yet that's right where he won't society he said no no he wants me to be joyous and happy well why not be joyous and happy you mean you're down and out because God said something about quote Bert around he said if he asked God and he told him no he said oh no it's a better than anything else I could get something perforation if he tells you no that's more real and all the yeses you're asked for but then do you turn around and ask him again yeah but Lourdes you don't understand you don't understand my problems yeah we're trying to get him to come down on our ground being gonna do it yeah how is it by raising children sometimes you out spank them right because that may be against the law and immoral but that's I think got to do with it yeah you got to correct the child I didn't write the book God wrote the book he even said beat a child that won't die no if somebody come up to me and they had black all over them bruises and they said well daddy woman would I'd be the first one take you to jail so I'm not talking wrong right I just take you to jail cuz I don't believe in I don't believe that's what the Bible talking about well it said beater child ya know there's a lot of difference in a whipping and a beatin you know I remember white one time here he was gonna he got old enough you know and he was he wasn't gonna be a boy anymore you ain't gonna be a kid no more well I do worry about something well I tapped him a couple of times with a belt I noticed him he just border you know I said we gotta settle if one way or the other said God do something because he's done bowing up so I had a little belt I didn't kill him I didn't leave no big bruises or great big spots on him all I done was just kind of tapped him a little bit and that didn't work I tapped him a little bit again little R that didn't work I said one way or the other Kapow nah that's okay you through I didn't have to do the fourth one right why because you will call it breaking the spirit you wanna call it whatever you want to call it do it that's up to you you know as to what's doing that's uh you know we used to whip our children no I did more than I did but that's still the point you know but see if we we didn't pet him they was waiting Terrence was out in the yard one Hey I don't know where he'll remember that you know white was bigger than Terrence but they'd seen him down in the yard and they got into a fight well I just stepped out on the porch I say boys and though they were scrapland goods you know he wasn't either one killing each other and they was just and then I said come on up boys and they come up through that well both of them by then see they would live up daddy he jumped on me hey tup don't hate he done this he don't know and I didn't do it like I said come on Ian I saw the fight okay both of you lay with the bed you know just enough to let him know you don't you don't have to hit very hard I've always think about God as he corrects us with nail scars in his hands you know you don't never think of it that because that's justice the way God but he has to correct us my point God is real God is real he's not just the thoughts of your mind you're not something you could conjure up you know to make something he's real when are we going to realize that and just settle down to that and think about it and let him talk to us that way and deal with us as human beings faith is the substance of things hoped for now the best way I can describe it how many of you wants more of God you know how did you get more of God by faith right you want more watermelon what do you do you eat watermelon you want more faith just study the Word of God and it just keeps getting stronger and greater because he's real I'm trying to make a point emphasis you're saved by grace that's God's unmerited favor we didn't do anything to get it nothing we couldn't do it anyway it's all of what he done the Bible said if he didn't call us we can't be saved right well I just got saved I just went to the altar I just believe the Lord I'm saved now words the scripture for that my Bible says no man can come to God unless God calls you but it also got more to do with it then he says many are called and what you were chosen all right now let's see what is the depth of your faith like I said we've been in the message now some 40 50 years we ought to have a at least an intellectual understanding right to be in the message and study one message all of those years we're not a bad dish that said well we spent 300 years and a Baptist you'll never grant gained one ounce I'm as serious as I can be I remember from where I started in the Baptist to where I left they had not gained 1 ounce upon Revelation now you tell me am i right thank back where you come from you know what I mean the church we was in it was known for getting rid of preachers and I've always on the wrong side you know where I was at I don't know preachers side and I was always in trouble because of that but we had one guy lasted three months because you have to be in the Baptist to understand the Deacon board runs the Baptist Church is not the pastor the Deacon board runs the Baptist Church and they told us said now what you do if that and I were mention it to one here while back knee is dialed life and he's a Baptist preacher and see they told us you're a deacon if that Baptist preacher gets off the faith you know the Baptist faith you're supposed to go up now that's my nephew and he verified that I was Rodney this is like they're supposed to go up you're supposed to take his Bible fold it up and dismiss the congregation and send him home because he's off the Baptist faith well would that be pretty good you know just because it he's off the faith he's in life he said well it you do have to be off the faith to do it see you think I tell a lot of things that are crazy you know what I told him in the Deacons meeting one night went on Deacon told me that I said come on fellas I mean brothers I said you had deacons in the book of Acts I said the only thing that they done was waited on tables my nephew life when I told him there because I did I said all that I know the Deacons to do is wait on tables and you telling me where to run this and run that so you don't think that a lot of things goes home unless you go out among it and learn it and then I say something like that to you well I don't know well that's true and I will go check it out I like brother dick Addison about that I'd say something we at least go check it out find out if it's true because you see what I'm getting at if you've been in a church for 10 years and you haven't grown in grace and knowledge there's something wrong with something wrong with you because your faith has stopped faith is a revelation it's a substance which is a revelation all right but it's the substance of things hoped for now listen now put brother Browns definition with it faith is the substance of things hoped for he said now you have it so now hope for much it look like it's something you're hoping you have and not true with salvation salvation is not based on hope now it is if you know what the word whole means because the word hope can be taken all the way into faith once the things we hope for all right see if you don't know the depth of the word hope your you'll be tying it up like I said you know we talked about believing the Bible doesn't say he that believes in his baptized he said he didn't believe it you stopped believing there's something wrongly you can lose your salvation yeah I will burn it out I don't understand that you think I can be saved today and lost tomorrow no I believe you can have a mental concept of salvation and think and hope that you're saved and believe that you're saved and Swire that you're safe and still be lost but I believe that well that's your evidence that's what the Prophet said what is the evidence that long ago whether or not the spirit in you now listen to agrees with the word not agreed whether it agrees with the word that's what I'm talking about a Christian journey through faith your Christian journey started today you accepted Jesus Christ as your Savior all right now if it stops anywhere there's something wrong how many of you can remember how the Lord brought you into the word can you remember that mr. Johnny can remember it real good because see her brother brother Doherty he was in this cult down in Lula Georgia she was up in New York and her brothers got all tied up in this stuff move she has come down here to go straighten us all out kind of like the story brother entails her other colleagues never ever each one it was about to Jehovah Witness but she came down here she wanted to see what brother Doherty had got into well you know what convinced her most of you know the story she here with us for a few days well no okay I kind of got their own whale singing they got their own well do it they got their a little bit of different what we are you know whatever it's okay don't know yet we'll see Anna she was I don't know maybe 10 years old 8 or 10 at that time something well sister Johnny was fixing to leave and Anna walked up to her and says come back sister Johnny and be with us said we love you you know thank you for coming you know what she went home there weren't all them great big revelations it wasn't all of them great big things we was doing she said grown folks can lie to you and tell you they love you when they don't but said kids don't do that so what was the thing that kept that brought salvation to sister Johnny in the basis of believing the message and coming on and now down here with us Anna in a little statement of we love you glad to come be with us did that put her in a Christian journey she used to call me from New York I know she kind of hot straightened out was all right she called me from New York we talked for an hour you know she said well there's one thing about it said everybody else down there they get to see you I don't get to see but said I'm talked to you and said look it don't cost me very much and it did get kind of funny because her husband he said her she started out in the basement with the washing and everything said now you've got that preacher up in the bedroom playing his tapes you know kind of make a part of the laugh she she had a Christian journey she moved along Laura it's just telling you so we think of every one of us could think about what happened in our journey that brought us to a place you know I'm talking about some of you like me too in my raise Danny let me talk about to you though I got for a decent memory really Larry he used to tell me this and that and they would always have to go to Ron's and eat so what I think tell you a little bit about her journey I go down to Ron's listen to him talk go brother Tom fought Bush we had two rides down that away you get all tied up a little bit about this out of the other I got a phone call about gooey breakfast so I got a broad breakfast you know but listen church how real is your God your salvation is based upon how real your God is if you don't have a real God then you need to find one I believe the devil that's more real to most people than God is because they don't know him as a person you realize salvation what are you saying brother you realize salvation is a person no I thought it's an experience I thought of something salvations a person I thought it was the revelation of Jesus Christ I thought that's what the prophets they Christ mystery of God revealed when he said what is the new birth then brother Branham he said it's the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you now listen the new birth is a revelation of Jesus Christ to you not to brother branham no not going this saying it like it is it's not the brother branham to you right it's got to be something personal now how God send it that's up to him at that's I hope you understand my point it's not based on how much you know then we can claim to believe with the message let's come over you don't talk to me on a lot of things cuz you start saying well I believe the message well I'm gonna start saying where was you at last week when the Prophet said you can't wait for the church doors to open come on I can quote the Prophet you want to get with me on you know what I'm talking about you know the seriousness of the whole thing do we put everything we've got on what he says where we still got a little bit left over well I think it always gets me when I hear somebody we start to talking and they say brother they'll I think oh we got a road to go now we fix them to go down a rabbit trail cause you're saying I think right it ain't what I think it's what God says because see there's the point you think you're saved because you don't do this you don't do that you do this you think you're saved and God says that don't save you is that the way the Prophet said it does he say it that way I mean do I need to read them to you we try to make our salvation based upon our thoughts and ideas instead of what God says in his word saved by grace through faith we've been a little journey of a Christian walking can't you remember when things are revealed now this is this is one unsure that you won't never agree you know you probably never relate to it but have you ever noticed your Christian journey when you first start oh you're just so happy you're just traveling and you're just moving and every time as there's something new and then you just keep on reading and you and something new unfold something new unfold something new one folk night a while it starts getting to be less and less and less now am i right do you remember your Christian journey that way then when you first started you like a little baby God this gives you everything you cry for right a while you cry and he just I keep going on vacation he's training this God doing his brother Gary off boys in God don't want spoiled brats we used to get the tip of that if sister or some of you remember her three boys I think it was anyhow she had this more than a spoon or something wouldn't a paddle about this being a little Hickory or something and Bud one of them kids went to see Gopal and you could hear it you know but you didn't hear it no more that in today well Gary said she know that raised kids he'll see well in their awed that sometimes God has to use the rod of Correction no to get us the line up well no he's a loving God well I can say right real quick you lay on that real heavy with me you know what i'ma say you ain't saved oh you might not like that terminology but you're not saved cuz there's no such thing in my salvation to do I can't I've had him to tell me this I told you about it I was in trouble a little problem and things and I was praying not getting a car one day and I start that down the road and later Terence one met him I said they said where you going I said one for a ride and I was at one of them low points I was down and out wowsie wowsie who wouldn't even enough to get me started and I was just crying and oh man I was just driving down the road I'm just so upset and Lord everything's gone wrong think of a highway to my full and something said like this said hey you think you having problems what do you think I went through I cried all the way back home but it was a different cry you wouldn't no powdi thing it was a different cry he had just let me know that I was acting like a big old baby and I needed a good spanking then he just give it to me and I drove back home crying from a different cry a Christian journey sure we know about grace chilling talk about the unmerited favor but what about a journey in all of that what about a journey of faith what about walking in a realm with God that he's real now come on folks every one of the kids in tho here knows who Superman is you know who Batman is you know all about these things and who played the parts and who they were whatever right but do you know Jesus Christ how about it do we know Jesus Christ as being real you don't get nothing out of it on this island in a minute you just remember one time brother Dale believes in a real God I don't believe in just the thoughts from my imagination come on my imagination runs wild until he wouldn't even want to deal with my thoughts yet he's real if faith is the substance and we're saved by faith now come on do you agree with that is the Bible all right or do we need to read some more brother Branham or whatever do you believe you're saved by faith well no we'll say by through faith brother Dale you know we're saved by grace through faith all right are you really saved through faith are you going through a journey in your own Christian experience but nobody loves me I'm all down and out I'm a beginner enough wondering if the Lord loves me and talked to him in a while I thought we ain't I don't tell now you need that series the other day and ain't no bad for a preacher the way I am because I have more of a teacher style I can just drop back pick us up run that away while you're starting into a series it's all well and good and while you in the middle of the series are all well and good but when it starts winding down to end you get worried where am I going next but he's never failed me but he'll let me get so local I'm like I'm thanking Lord I'm over the cliff will you grab me cause he done I'm falling then he said okay go this way and he don't talk to me a lot I always he did but when he ever speaks I don't worry I don't worry about who don't agree with it and God speaks to me I have no thoughts about whether it's right or wrong I love thoughts about wondered which way I'm going yeah but not whether it's right or wrong I told you about it many times my wife was up in the garden one day and something's going on and I told my wife I said this will happen this away she said it'll never happen I said it either happen that away or I'll quit preaching she said you preached your life sermon well she was telling the truth as far as the natural was it's the only place there is where you've got something real see my you say well in the brother Dale I don't want to get on the spot of any hey I'm on the spot every service I claim to be speaking of what God has given me to brain and they got enough sense to know that if I don't bring it his way I'm gonna be condemned with it the very thing that I brain you know for sure I want to keep it right faith faith is not what you can remember faith is not how much you can memorize so that's what we think it is we think faith is a memory or to memorize something no it's a substance now listen do you realize this God speaking to you you realize that he gives you his thought he just gave you a part of his own substance part of his own being do you believe him that away faith is a revelation it's something God has revealed to you something he's revealed to you it's yours because he gave it to you and it's a substance it's like we've talked about you know a lot of things happening now and I was bitching doesn't want to go about it knit to somebody you know I mean if if we're gonna go this distance and fall apart and it goes to prove we didn't uh no salvation start with our salvation wasn't real it was a confession it was us accepting him but has he accepted you but brother Taylor you're not afraid of being on the Internet to the world no why should I be afraid about what I believe cuz of all they said this one point I mean remember this one I've always said it is what there's one thing see that I have in my favor if I'm wrong and you come correct me like take correction so I can't lose but if I'm right then ain't worried about you or anybody else well that's just being sarcastic well is it see followed this message long enough to know this message has no contradictions in it right now people make contradictions people make thoughts that are wrong little random said things that are wrong but the message has no contradictions what about a wonderful message that we talk like that the message is so perfect until there's no contradictions that it does not contradict in any way the written word of God because it is the written word made alive this to me is God in a letter phone okay now what this book says I believe and that's where when I preach I preach from this book the prophets message yeah because if you can see my Bible you'd see it he's got a lot of markings on it because all those markings is telling you what the Prophet said about these things all right now we get to this little thought later to show you how it work jesus said unless you're born to water in spirit you can't enter the kingdom water and spirit what do you think that means water and spirit well it means water baptism the Holy Ghost baptism that's a good thought but ain't true good thought good point but it ain't what he's talking about hmm so I searched and I searched go to No hey there's something wrong nah that doesn't compare with the rest of the world so I searched until I find where the Prophet said it you know what he said he said you're washed by the water of the word and then you get the baptism of the Holy Ghost so it is water and spirit see that way I depend upon what he's saying to me of what the word says because I know if I'm right and if it has been revealed to me then I have no worry about what's going to come forth you know I don't want to worry about what anybody else says well brother Li don't agree oh that's all right ain't no problem you show me what it says well I think it nars that thing you know I think it but what is your faith now let's say this for a minute and we'll quit see when you first accepted Jesus Christ that started your Christian journey right now we're gonna run through faith for a little bit we're gonna have a little journey through faith you started your Christian journey you started growing you started increasing in what in the memory of the word no no in the revelation and the revelation of the word you remember when you read the Bible you remember when you first started and then compare that to your understanding today and I didn't say had knowledge now because that's not right head knowledge ain't gonna save nothing that's our problem what about the Christian journey that started today us born again and it's been unfolding ever since I don't mean do you know more about the message by head knowledge I mean has the message become an anchor for the Soul yeah an anchor for the Soul is a substance you'll need having an anchor if you ain't got somewhere to put it in listener this is substance we're gonna pick up yes we're gonna get into justification and help for the children and the sanctification of baptism we'll all go but this is the main point right here to start it that you're saved by grace through faith and as long as that journey keeps unfolding you're saving is correct but if that journey stops you're proven you never had it yeah but you're making snow ain't liking it I'm making it anything but what you're saying but I thought you could eternal life you can't be lost if you get eternal life you can't be long I'm a firm believer in eternal security now listen listen you and I talk - I'm a firm believer in once saved always saved if you're truly saved if you're truly saved you'll never be lost but if you're not truly saved you're gonna be lost somewhere you're gonna go off somewhere to eternal security I'm a firm believer in eternal security once born again I always born again once born again not what we talked about not well I know I'd say bless God you can't tell me I ain't saved ain't tryin to ain't trying to tell you you're lost I'm trying to tell you you'll find out pretty quick what your Christian journey has turned out to be when this thing passes a few more turns of life and oh it's got to happen for something that's got to take place irregardless but when it does we're all gonna prove what we are but can you agree how many of these had to change your thoughts you know saying for a minute musicians come on oh how many of you used to be Trinitarians we swore by being regards didn't Lee right that's rude we swore by three guards what's the difference in I am we fired by one as your journey increased in Revelation or has it decreased because it is a travel journey you started as a child and you grow in grace and knowledge that's Baptist we started as a child and 20 years later we're still a child I see that in the message so much until I know I'm sorry I say things hard sometimes cuz I see that old thing that I used to watch back there the tur salvation never increased as yours increased what about it let stand well we got just remember one time salvation is a journey have you ever had the journey of justification sanctification the baptism when the Holy Ghost well brother though I didn't know I could well then you don't have it I can't remember what happened back there and where I came from you never had an experience that's that's what she falls back on these people think we'll all you got to do brother tell you you make salvation something hard to do when all you got to do just believe on the Lord Jesus Christ that's all you gonna do is you can accept Jesus Christ if it happens it happens if it don't we're not in the journey and you know what we proved when we are I think that's the end of the message don't drop the way back because that's the thought that came to me to start a new series you know the end of our journey will prove what we are and will look back and see where we come from and see that it's been a journey God has been leading us and guiding us you remember the story about the little boy you know walking behind his daddy in his footsteps let's just find our God and walk with Him there's not anything hard let's just find out where our God is real is God holding you are you holding him which one is we know for certain we can't hold him is he holding us yes talking little plain language you know what brother Dale I have so many problems agreed we all do but now 40 years ago did I have the same problem now we're getting in a different place right well brother Li just thought would I walk about 40 years well I had problems in doing well I think it's about time to find out whether we're real and what's going on go ahead brother ma yeah let's sing power in the blood anybody have a need just
