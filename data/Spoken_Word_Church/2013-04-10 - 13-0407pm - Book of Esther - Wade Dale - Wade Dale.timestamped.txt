[0:00] and they celebrated every year in in the
[0:03] uh day of purm which is p r i m which is
[0:06] the day that they were saved from
[0:09] destruction as far as natural
[0:11] destruction but what a what a type of of
[0:15] you and I that where we saw that there
[0:18] was a day at Calvary right amen a day of
[0:21] purum at Calvary where a man purified
[0:24] himself and died at Calvary to set us
[0:26] free then here we see that there was a
[0:29] story here in the book of Esther of how
[0:31] that God worked through and I want us to
[0:34] see the the actors and the the parts of
[0:37] the play I don't know if we've a lot of
[0:39] you are new that since 2007 and 8 so
[0:43] maybe you can uhu bear with me the ones
[0:45] that already have heard this but I'm
[0:48] sure probably most of you forgot because
[0:50] I it's been a while so Book of Esther
[0:54] and then we're going to do 1 Corinthians
[0:55] 10:1 so just sit back and relax and
[0:58] we're going to go through the whole Book
[1:00] of Esther and show how God put all these
[1:04] people in their place and how it's a
[1:06] perfect type of you and I cuz Esther is
[1:08] a type of the bride all right so let's
[1:10] bow our heads before we get started dear
[1:12] heavenly father we pray Lord that today
[1:14] you
[1:15] will take this word Lord that's being
[1:19] spoken and make it alive in our hearts
[1:21] we know this happened some 3,000 years
[1:24] ago Lord in in history and we know that
[1:28] many things have been spoken about it
[1:30] and we know Lord that many commentaries
[1:34] have been written but you sent a prophet
[1:36] Lord that opened the book he showed us
[1:41] what was going on in scripture so now we
[1:43] can take the same Bible and and use the
[1:47] types and the shadows and see how Lord
[1:49] that we can apply it to our life and how
[1:52] that these things that went through a a
[1:55] common girl's life and and a man that
[1:58] she meets and certain one
[2:00] and and how that all is applied to our
[2:03] life and all the people around the
[2:06] players and the and the things that went
[2:08] on in this in this story Lord may we
[2:11] take it today and apply it to our life
[2:13] and let it not be let it not be
[2:15] something Lord that we just fill up time
[2:17] and space but Lord as the scripture says
[2:19] may it be an example Glory of what you
[2:22] and I here in this congregation what we
[2:24] need Lord I pray father that you just be
[2:27] with us heal the sick and afflicted
[2:30] be with the ones Lord that need
[2:32] salvation be with the ones that are not
[2:34] here today Lord the ones that are
[2:35] traveling be with a little bride around
[2:38] the world Lord bless the missionaries on
[2:39] the Foreign Fields Lord give them fruit
[2:41] for their labor the ones that are out
[2:42] there Lord pressing the battle we pray
[2:45] now that you just be with us bless us
[2:47] keep us we put all things in your hand
[2:49] in the name of Jesus Christ
[2:51] amen all right we got First Corinthians
[2:54] 10:1 now all these things happen unto
[2:58] them talking about the Old Testament to
[3:01] them all those things happen unto
[3:05] them for examples right and they are
[3:09] written Paul said for our admonition
[3:13] amen upon whom the ends of the world are
[3:16] come right which is you and I you may be
[3:19] seated and the Lord add his Blessing to
[3:21] the reading of the word but they're
[3:23] given to us four examples amen now if
[3:27] you'll turn to the Book of Esther
[3:30] and uh brother Bob said his kids were
[3:32] actually having some some questions
[3:33] about the Book of Esther so maybe this
[3:35] is a a very fitting time that we that we
[3:39] go through it but I want to go through
[3:41] and and it is
[3:44] not coincidence that this happened it's
[3:48] not that it's written in scripture this
[3:49] way for a coincidence we just saw that
[3:52] they were written for our example
[3:55] right so let's go if you have a if you
[3:58] have a scull fill Bible
[4:01] look at Scofield's footnotes now it
[4:03] won't be up here but if you have a
[4:05] Scofield bible I'm going to read his
[4:07] commentary because this is going to set
[4:08] a stage and tell you where this is going
[4:11] to
[4:12] happen all right so if you have a scull
[4:15] field Bible look in the footnotes if you
[4:16] don't just listen to what I'm saying the
[4:18] significance of the Book of Esther is
[4:20] that it testifies to the secret watch
[4:23] care of Jehovah over dispersed Israel
[4:27] the name of God does not once occur
[4:31] but in no other book of the
[4:34] Bible is his Providence more conspicuous
[4:38] in other words the Providence of God
[4:40] working in a group of people a mere
[4:42] Remnant returned to
[4:44] Jerusalem now listen to this the mass of
[4:48] the nation preferred the easy and
[4:51] lucrative
[4:58] life what is le
[5:01] to
[5:04] right now this is commentary from a man
[5:08] scofi it says the mass of the nation
[5:11] preferred the easy and lucrative life
[5:14] under the Persian rule in other words
[5:17] they like the
[5:18] normal he High minded lovers of pleasure
[5:21] more than lovers of God so it's l to see
[5:24] all the way up but God did not forsake
[5:27] them you now are inlay
[5:32] you drove a leot ofan car you're feeling
[5:34] some good leot of and air conditioning
[5:36] right now right so we're not but we're
[5:39] not part of the leosan doctrine of of of
[5:44] the taking the rights of the people and
[5:46] all that but we are a little bit at ease
[5:48] and a little they like the lucrative
[5:50] life so the story of this is is Israel
[5:54] was dispersed or the Jews were dispersed
[5:57] but there was a group that stayed in
[5:59] Persia
[6:00] that stayed there because of the easy
[6:02] life they weren't exactly slaves they
[6:06] were actually integrated into some of
[6:09] the civilization there in the mes and
[6:11] Persians and this King he was over 127
[6:16] different provinces so this guy aurus he
[6:19] wasn't just a mere king of just a little
[6:22] bitty country he ruled from Russia all
[6:26] the way to Egypt that's pretty big the m
[6:29] Persians were some of the greatest they
[6:31] were some of the greatest writings and
[6:32] some of the greatest men and and
[6:35] philosophy of the day came from the me
[6:36] and Persians so here we got a we're
[6:39] starting we're setting a stage here that
[6:41] where the Book of Esther begins says now
[6:43] came to pass and the days of a
[6:46] surus this is the sorus which rained
[6:49] from
[6:50] India to Ethiopia all right over 170 and
[6:55] 20 provinces that's a lot all right so
[6:59] now he was a king and this King had
[7:02] power and he was a great ruler so we're
[7:05] going to look at him and see that that
[7:07] this man and even if you'll pull up the
[7:10] the Greek
[7:11] Lexicon the word
[7:18] asaurus there's no title there's no
[7:21] meaning to his
[7:24] name yeah his name was a
[7:28] mystery m-hm his name was a mystery
[7:32] question mark they don't know what his
[7:34] name was you know what we're going to
[7:35] give him God right we're going to give
[7:39] him the name God cuz he was a God
[7:41] over that Province all right so that in
[7:45] those days when the king aurus sat on
[7:47] the throne of his
[7:49] kingdom which was in shushan the palace
[7:52] that word shushan means
[7:56] Lily he's a lily of the valley
[7:59] amen you see how this you watch you're
[8:02] going to see all this this picture come
[8:03] into into being and and if it bores you
[8:06] then God forgive me for taking up your
[8:09] sweet
[8:11] time in the third year of his Reign
[8:13] we're going to see a lot of Threes And
[8:15] Sevens
[8:17] and you're going to see this all right
[8:20] in the third year of his Reign he made a
[8:23] feast unto all his
[8:26] princes and his servants
[8:29] the power of Persia and media he didn't
[8:33] leave nothing out he's almighty God he
[8:36] owns everything all right the Nobles and
[8:39] princes of the provinces being before
[8:43] him when he showed the riches of his
[8:45] glorious Kingdom and the honor of his
[8:47] excellent Majesty many days even 104
[8:50] score
[8:52] days and when these days were
[8:55] expired the king made a feast unto all
[8:58] the people
[9:01] people all the people so it wasn't
[9:03] excluding
[9:07] anybody that were present in shushan the
[9:10] palace but unto Great and
[9:14] Small there's no big eyes and little you
[9:16] there's no great ones to God and there's
[9:18] no little ones we're all the same so
[9:20] what but watch this King show and this
[9:23] is what it really helped me because it's
[9:25] it's it's presenting this King as a very
[9:29] righteous man now he might have not been
[9:31] but he's it's portraying in this in this
[9:34] story that he had all power but even
[9:38] common people could come to his Feast
[9:40] yeah right even Great and Small right
[9:44] seven
[9:46] days are seven Church ages in the court
[9:49] of the garden of the king's
[9:51] Palace all right now
[9:55] look you had to be
[9:58] present
[10:02] look at verse
[10:03] five he made a feast on the ones that
[10:05] were there right on Sunday yeah and
[10:10] Wednesday
[10:12] yeah
[10:14] right if you weren't there you weren't
[10:17] invited
[10:20] yeah both great and small seven days in
[10:22] the court of the garden of the king's
[10:24] Palace where were white green and blue
[10:28] hangings
[10:29] fashioned with cords of fine linen and
[10:31] we could go through all that look at
[10:33] verse
[10:35] seven now they gave them drinking
[10:37] vessels of
[10:39] gold the vessels being diverse from one
[10:43] from the other in other words they all
[10:44] weren't the same right
[10:53] build they were not the same Personality
[10:57] yeah but but he gave them all drink and
[11:01] it was all in Gold but they were
[11:04] diverse one from another and Royal Wine
[11:09] in
[11:10] abundance not just a portion he gave it
[11:13] to them in abundance remember we're in
[11:15] the lay out of seean church age he give
[11:17] it to us in abundance according to the
[11:19] state of the king and the drinking was
[11:22] according to the
[11:24] law in other words nothing got out of
[11:27] control he gave us the word as we needed
[11:30] it all right because remember you got a
[11:34] group that drinks of the wine of the
[11:36] fornication that gets drunk on
[11:38] it right in Revelations the old wh
[11:41] Church remember right she drinks it and
[11:43] gets drunk off of it this was this was
[11:46] given out in portion according to the
[11:48] law none did compel in other words
[11:51] nobody complain for so the king had
[11:53] appointed to all the officers of his
[11:54] house that they should do according to
[11:57] Every Man's pleasure all right let's go
[11:58] to verse n because here's where vasy
[12:01] comes in now vashy was the wife she was
[12:04] the queen she was the one that was the
[12:08] that was the king's wife right and Vash
[12:11] time which the word Vash time means
[12:14] beautiful she was a beautiful Church she
[12:17] was adorned in many things she was very
[12:20] beautiful she wasn't ugly she was
[12:21] beautiful John admired her
[12:24] yeah in the Book of Revelations yeah
[12:28] John admired this
[12:30] queen and Bash the queen Made A Feast
[12:33] for the women in the Royal house now
[12:37] look the king made a
[12:40] feast and she decided she was going to
[12:43] have a feast right a separate one yeah
[12:48] all right so we got to get a stage set
[12:49] here for Esther to come on the scene
[12:51] because King aorus he said we're going
[12:53] to have a feast and we're going to have
[12:55] this and we're going to have that and
[12:57] then bashy pops up
[12:59] and she's going to make a feast for the
[13:02] women in the Royal house which belonged
[13:05] to King
[13:06] aorus on the seventh day when the heart
[13:08] of the King was married with wine he
[13:10] commanded these people now hang on just
[13:12] a second because what vashti was doing
[13:15] was she was setting up a
[13:18] separate
[13:20] Feast oh yeah
[13:25] denomination the king didn't cut her off
[13:28] she cut herself off right by making her
[13:31] own Feast see that's what got the king
[13:34] God to thinking hey she doesn't want to
[13:37] be at my Feast she wants to make one of
[13:40] her own all right so that got the
[13:42] natural King to thinking here and
[13:44] showing that that Vash though she's
[13:47] beautiful she didn't do what the king
[13:50] said to do all right cuz she had a feast
[13:53] for the
[13:54] women yeah
[13:56] churches yeah mhm right come on over
[13:59] here on my side she says oh
[14:02] yeah but now look on the seventh day
[14:09] listen when the heart of the King was
[14:11] married with wine he
[14:15] commanded
[14:17] seven
[14:22] people 1 2 3 4 5 6 7even look at the
[14:28] last one
[14:32] what's his
[14:33] name
[14:35] carcass where the carcass is there the
[14:39] Eagles shall be
[14:40] gathered you see how this is kind of
[14:42] working in because he commanded these
[14:45] people and these other ones have names
[14:47] like man man means faithful abatha means
[14:50] god-given they all have a god-given name
[14:53] each one of these do like the seven
[14:55] Church ages you come up to where now
[14:57] what did he do he gathered he commanded
[15:00] these Church age Messengers
[15:05] yeah everybody okay right he commanded
[15:08] these Church AE Messengers seven of
[15:12] them the seven chamberlains which were
[15:14] what Unix right they were Unix before
[15:18] the before the
[15:19] king and actually you can look they
[15:23] served in the presence of the king
[15:26] yeah they were right there with him the
[15:28] Seven Stars the seven Church Ages were
[15:31] right there with him the whole time but
[15:33] now because remember what's going to
[15:34] develop out of these seven Watch What
[15:36] Happens now what they were going to do
[15:38] was to bring vashi the queen before the
[15:42] king with the Royal Crown to show the
[15:45] people yeah her
[15:49] beauty he was wanting to show his
[15:53] bride exactly all right to show the
[15:56] people and the princes her beauty for
[15:58] she was fair to look on but the queen
[16:01] vasti
[16:04] refused
[16:06] refused to come to the king's
[16:16] commandment not by the
[16:18] king he sent it to The Messengers right
[16:21] and The Messengers went to
[16:24] vashan by his chamberlains the king
[16:26] didn't do it he had one of his
[16:28] Messengers go do it or his Messengers to
[16:31] go but the queen vast refused to come
[16:34] what he sent seven Church age prophets
[16:38] to call out a bride he called a bride
[16:42] out but there's a bride refused yeah
[16:44] right there's a there's a group that
[16:46] refused furtherment of the word the
[16:48] prophet said she refused actually you
[16:51] know what she's saying she's refusing
[16:53] the
[16:55] king she wasn't refusing just to come to
[16:58] the feast right she was refusing the
[17:00] King right and any part of what he was
[17:03] having to do right you see how she's
[17:05] separating herself because of what she
[17:08] wants cuz she wanted to have a feast all
[17:10] right but the queen basti refused to
[17:12] come to the king's come at the king's
[17:15] commandment by his chamberlains
[17:18] therefore was the king very rough and
[17:19] his anger burned in him then the king
[17:22] said to the wise men which knew the
[17:24] times thank
[17:26] God for so was the king's manner toward
[17:28] all in you the law and judgment in other
[17:30] words what did he do he commanded down
[17:31] to his servants or his his uh wise men
[17:35] and then they carried out what he said
[17:36] that's the way a true that's the way a
[17:38] true leader should
[17:40] be and the next unto him now watch this
[17:45] and the next unto him was carena shethar
[17:48] aditha Tarsus meis marsana and
[17:53] mukan now when you come
[17:56] to Maman you you don't have to look it
[17:59] up but he was number
[18:01] seven all right keep that in mind
[18:04] because he's going to pop back up in a
[18:05] minute now why didn't the other six pop
[18:07] back up number seven pops back up all
[18:10] right so watch what he's doing mukan the
[18:13] seven princes of Persian now these were
[18:15] the wise men these were not the
[18:16] chamberlains these were the wise men all
[18:20] right and the Seven princes of Persia
[18:24] and media which saw the king's
[18:27] face and when sat at first in the
[18:29] Kingdom so they were right there with
[18:31] the King what shall we do unto the queen
[18:35] vashti according to law they couldn't do
[18:37] it any other way they had to do it
[18:38] according to law according to law
[18:40] because she had not performed the
[18:41] Commandment of the King by the
[18:44] chamberlands and mukan which is the
[18:46] seventh Prince number seven he gets up
[18:50] and does the
[18:52] talking right now why didn't the other
[18:55] six number seven is got a read he re you
[18:59] have to watch number seven in all this
[19:01] happening listen and mukan answered
[19:04] before the king and the princes vast the
[19:07] queen hath done wrong not done wrong to
[19:10] the king
[19:13] only mukam brought it to his attention
[19:16] that she wasn't just doing this to the
[19:18] King right she was doing it to all the
[19:21] people right but also do all the princes
[19:24] and all the people that are in all the
[19:27] provinces of the king so he's bringing
[19:30] it to the attention of the king said hey
[19:32] King this is not just you that
[19:34] she's you hear what brother Brown's
[19:36] coming in here you hear where that
[19:37] seventh angel messenger is calling out
[19:40] saying hey this is not right this is not
[19:43] only just going to it's just we're not
[19:45] just turning God down you're turning
[19:46] everything down all the princes all the
[19:48] people and all the province for this
[19:50] deed of the queen watch this for this
[19:53] deed of the queen shall come abroad un
[19:56] all churches women are churches right so
[20:00] that they shall despise their
[20:04] husbands in their
[20:06] eyes when it shall be reported the king
[20:09] of sorus commanded vashi the queen to be
[20:11] brought in before him but she came not
[20:13] yeah likewise shall the ladies of Meda
[20:15] and Persia say this day unto all the
[20:18] king's princes which have heard of the
[20:19] deed of the queen thus shall there
[20:22] arise too much contempt and wrath that
[20:27] seventh messenger was telling the king
[20:30] if we don't stop this right
[20:34] MH it's going to grow now what did
[20:38] Brother R come out doing he was
[20:39] preaching to the denominations get out
[20:42] of that thing you've become too much of
[20:44] a big of a big part of the of the
[20:47] Christian World come out of that because
[20:49] you're going to there's going to rise
[20:51] what brother R say the Pentecostal that
[20:53] you're contentious and you got this and
[20:55] you got that you see how God is doing
[20:57] this but I want you to to watch but now
[20:58] Esther's not come on the scene yet right
[21:01] cuz she's the
[21:03] bride she's not the messenger
[21:06] right she's not the Chamberlain she's
[21:09] not she's not that she's the bride all
[21:12] right but she's staying head for a
[21:13] little while until all these things can
[21:16] come out all right so now verse 19 if it
[21:19] please the
[21:21] king now he's telling the king this the
[21:23] king's not telling him this he's telling
[21:25] the king what he should do right now
[21:27] we're not telling God what to do but
[21:29] remember brother B said we're supposed
[21:30] to remind God of his promises and what
[21:34] he will do with his word right all right
[21:37] so that's what we're looking at here if
[21:38] it please the king Let There Go a royal
[21:40] commandment from him and let it be
[21:43] written among the laws of the Persians
[21:44] and and mes that it be not
[21:48] altered right boy pretty strong words
[21:52] that it be not altered that vashy come
[21:54] no
[21:56] more brother Brown said they lodges
[21:58] remember we talking about that the other
[21:59] day when he said they were lodges they
[22:02] can't be any more than that they're dead
[22:05] you can pull the people out but you
[22:07] cannot convert a church right they're
[22:10] dead they're done they're just like the
[22:12] Moose Lodge or the Masons or anything
[22:15] they're that's all they are all right so
[22:17] that's what he's saying this seventh
[22:19] messenger is telling telling the king
[22:22] that vasai come no more before King ass
[22:25] serus no more cut off looks like she's
[22:27] dead right and let the King give her
[22:30] Royal Estate unto another that is better
[22:32] than
[22:34] she he's taking that furtherment of the
[22:37] word that vasti should have
[22:39] received and going to give it to someone
[22:42] else all right so you see how this is
[22:44] set up and when the king's
[22:46] decree which he shall make shall be
[22:53] published about 1,00 of them
[22:56] mhm so sermons yeah right
[23:01] published H right cuz he said Let It Be
[23:05] written and when the king's decree which
[23:07] he shall make shall be published
[23:08] throughout all his Empire for it is
[23:11] great all the wives shall give their
[23:14] husband's honor in other words putting
[23:15] it back in order
[23:18] right that's what the prophet's message
[23:20] is for is to put everything back in
[23:22] order all
[23:25] right both great and small
[23:28] I like that in there because it's not
[23:30] we're not talking about some great group
[23:33] of people no it's a great and small it's
[23:35] everybody the congregation and the whole
[23:37] works that you give your husband honor
[23:40] and the saying pleas the King right and
[23:43] the
[23:44] princes and the King did according to
[23:47] the word of Maman yeah now the king did
[23:50] according to his word yeah for he sent
[23:56] letters to all the king King's provinces
[23:58] into every Province according to the
[24:00] writing thereof and every people after
[24:03] their language thank God they're doing
[24:05] that now that every man should bear rule
[24:08] in his own
[24:09] house yeah bringing everything back to
[24:11] order where the husband is the head and
[24:13] the wife all
[24:15] right into every Province according to
[24:17] the writing thereof and every people
[24:19] after their language that every man
[24:21] should bear rule in his own house and it
[24:23] should be published according to the
[24:25] language of every people right so he
[24:27] wanted to make sure that that sermon got
[24:30] out to all the world and that all the
[24:34] world was able to hear those sermons and
[24:38] understand
[24:39] that headship is where it's at right he
[24:44] didn't talk about whether she could cook
[24:45] good or cook bad or headship the husband
[24:48] was the rule and the wife was
[24:51] to go under him all right so now let's
[24:55] go to Esther 2 you're going to find a
[24:56] lady comes in to being now after all
[25:00] this after these
[25:03] things when the Wrath of the King was
[25:06] appeased he remembered basai and what
[25:09] she had done and what was decreed
[25:11] against her yeah then said the king's
[25:14] servants that ministered unto
[25:19] him you it it actually like the king
[25:22] ain't got a lot of
[25:24] sense but the king does have a lot of
[25:26] sense because what it is these people
[25:28] are around him so much they know what
[25:30] they know his mind exactly they know
[25:32] what kind of person he is they know what
[25:35] kind of uh uh they know what he's going
[25:37] to dish out so they're just going to
[25:40] remind him then said the king's servants
[25:42] that ministered unto him let there be
[25:44] fair young
[25:46] virgins sought for the King right and
[25:49] let the king appoint officers and all
[25:52] the provinces of his kingdom that they
[25:54] may gather together all the fair young
[25:56] virgins unto sushan the palace to the
[25:58] house of the women unto the custody of
[26:02] Hagi now the word Hagi in the strongs is
[26:06] a little bit different but I looked it
[26:08] up in another place and I didn't write
[26:09] it down but you know what the word h g
[26:14] means the
[26:17] word the word yeah now where else would
[26:20] you put
[26:23] a where else would you put a man right
[26:28] under the custody he's going to bring
[26:30] the young virgins and the women and how
[26:32] more to teach the young virgins than to
[26:34] teach the women than the word cuz
[26:37] remember Hagi or Hagi was a
[26:42] unic he was where he could be around the
[26:45] women this is the natural story he could
[26:47] be around the women and be The Keeper of
[26:48] the women and not have a problem all
[26:51] right same way with the word we're
[26:53] neither male or female in the gospel
[26:55] we're all females you know but until to
[26:57] the custody of hagga the king's
[26:59] Chamberlain Keeper of the women and let
[27:03] their things for purification be given
[27:05] them now we'll talk about that in just a
[27:06] second cuz we know what the purification
[27:09] is in their part but in our part we see
[27:14] what the purification was right where
[27:16] more can you get purified than to go to
[27:19] hagga the word all right and the maidens
[27:23] which pleaseth now listen this is still
[27:25] the guy this is still the servants
[27:26] Talking To The King
[27:28] and let the maiden which pleaseth the
[27:30] king be Queen instead of
[27:33] Asti and the thing pleased the king and
[27:36] he did so so he calls all the virgins in
[27:38] he says all right come in you're going
[27:39] to go over here and see this person
[27:42] named Ha guy and you're going to be
[27:45] purified and then I'm going you're going
[27:47] to present yourself to me all right but
[27:49] now look now we got to interject another
[27:53] character yeah into the life of Esther
[27:57] which was a a family member yeah all
[28:00] right and his name was Mori right now
[28:04] what does the word morai
[28:07] mean you can pull that one
[28:15] up about 5' five yeah 5'
[28:21] 6 now why would this
[28:24] person name being morai and it mean
[28:27] little
[28:29] man well brother Brandon was a little
[28:32] man
[28:33] right he this was this person was the
[28:36] cousin and the adopted father because
[28:39] Esther's mother and father was
[28:44] dead her old family was gone so she had
[28:48] to be raised by a
[28:51] cousin but if you'll go on through where
[28:55] we wanton today but if you'll continue
[28:57] in the
[28:59] studies look where he came from right
[29:02] and look who he was a student of
[29:05] right oh
[29:07] zerubabel what did zerubabel do
[29:11] zerubabel built the temple right so he
[29:14] was a Jew who returned from Exile with
[29:17] zerubabel yeah and you can read that in
[29:21] over in the book of Zechariah over in
[29:23] there about zerubba but that would but
[29:25] you see how they're all connected yes he
[29:27] come out with zerubabel who was to build
[29:31] the temple back and he was to restore
[29:34] order and here's
[29:36] Mori which we'll read right here it says
[29:38] now in shushan the palace there was a
[29:41] certain Jew so he wasn't outside he was
[29:43] in he was there he was in the palace
[29:46] whose name was
[29:48] Mori the son of gy the son of shami the
[29:52] son of Kish a
[29:56] benjaminite come from The Tribe of
[29:59] Benjamin not too bad right when the
[30:02] benjaminites are considered to be the
[30:04] 144,000
[30:06] right okay you see how this is kind of
[30:09] all coming together
[30:11] here and
[30:14] remember who Kish was Kish was the
[30:17] father of
[30:18] Saul yeah all right you say how'd that
[30:22] tie in brother R's family wasn't in very
[30:25] good line
[30:29] drunks made whiskey right so you say
[30:33] well that's a great tribe but now when
[30:34] he come from right here he wasn't a very
[30:37] good guy but still God's used that
[30:40] lineage and brought it all the way from
[30:42] Benjamin down to Kish Shi to Mori so he
[30:46] or gy now look who had been carried away
[30:50] from Jerusalem verse 6 with the
[30:51] Captivity which had been carried away
[30:53] with Janiah king of Judah when whom
[30:56] nebuch bzar the king of Babylon had
[30:58] carried
[30:59] away and he brought with
[31:02] her he brought I mean he brought with
[31:05] him
[31:07] hadassa
[31:09] yeah they were K folks yeah and who is
[31:13] hadassa but Esther right that's the word
[31:18] hadassa means
[31:21] Myrtle now if you'll look in Leviticus
[31:24] 23:33 see this just breaks out to a
[31:26] whole different study if you want to I'm
[31:27] just going to do this real quick today
[31:30] but the study of Esther brings you right
[31:31] back to Myrtle which is used in the
[31:33] Feast of Tabernacles in Leviticus
[31:36] 23:33 and that's where the word hadassa
[31:39] came from is Myrtle but then you've got
[31:41] Esther which means
[31:44] star his uncle's daughter for she had
[31:46] neither father nor
[31:50] mother she had neither father or mother
[31:52] she didn't have somebody to tell her
[31:54] what to
[31:54] do but she was brought up by
[31:57] his
[31:58] uncle's daughter for she had neither
[32:00] father nor mother the maid was fair and
[32:02] beautiful who Mori when her father and
[32:04] mother were dead took for his own
[32:07] daughter all right so here you've got
[32:09] Esther which is the type of the Bride
[32:11] now she shows
[32:12] up her Jewish name is
[32:16] hadassa but she got a name change to
[32:20] Esther but her Jewish name was hadassa
[32:23] and she kept that name for a little
[32:25] while but that's something else to get
[32:27] into later so it came to pass when the
[32:30] king's commandment and his decree Was
[32:32] Heard got to be there to hear it and
[32:35] when many maidens were gathered together
[32:37] unto the palace to the custody of Hagi
[32:41] that Esther was brought also un the
[32:43] King's house to the custody of the
[32:46] word right of Hagi The Keeper of the
[32:48] women in other words Mori said
[32:51] here this is my daughter this is my
[32:55] family here's I'm turning you over to be
[32:59] part of those virgins right and the
[33:02] Maiden pleased
[33:05] who not the king she hadn't met him yet
[33:09] right please
[33:11] haga the word and the Maiden pleased him
[33:15] and she obtained kindness of him he's
[33:18] talking about hagga not talking about
[33:20] the king not talking about Mori talking
[33:22] about Mori
[33:24] turned the bride over
[33:28] to the word right and the word is what's
[33:31] nurturing us now
[33:33] right and look he speedily gave her her
[33:38] things for purification he didn't lag
[33:41] around and he didn't let
[33:43] her dilly dally around he gave her
[33:47] speedily gave her things for her
[33:51] purification all right now that word
[33:52] purification we can get on down a little
[33:54] bit further but it really means to scour
[33:57] to polish to scrub and to
[33:59] cleanse and that's what they did they
[34:01] took the women they took them through a
[34:03] time of purification which such things
[34:05] as belong to her and give her seven
[34:09] maidens which were meat to be given her
[34:12] out of the King's
[34:15] house this girl is
[34:19] special because hey guys not just giving
[34:22] her just some maidens and giving her
[34:25] some he's given her seven maidens which
[34:29] were out of the King's house
[34:32] already okay and he preferred her and
[34:36] her Maids unto the best place of the
[34:40] House of the women now
[34:43] why Esther must be
[34:45] special yeah but now remember Esther was
[34:49] a Jew yes keep that in mind Esther was a
[34:53] Jew and and she didn't want to show
[34:57] herself or her people right okay cuz
[35:02] look Esra had not showed her
[35:06] people let me read get my oh estra had
[35:09] not showed her people nor her Kindred
[35:11] for morai had charged her that she
[35:13] should not show
[35:14] it but now watch verse 11 Mori didn't
[35:19] just leave
[35:20] her I hope you're thinking a little
[35:22] spiritual here yeah right Mori didn't
[35:25] just leave her with Hagi right and leave
[35:29] her in the palace and leave her
[35:31] alone Mori walked every
[35:35] day he didn't miss a service right he
[35:39] walked every day before the court of the
[35:42] women's house now he couldn't go in
[35:47] right he can't go
[35:50] in he had to stay out here but he kept
[35:52] watch that's right Glory before the
[35:55] courtner of the woman's house to know
[35:57] how Esther
[35:58] did and what should become of her he
[36:01] didn't just kick her out and go kick his
[36:03] feet up and set under a shade tree
[36:05] somewhere no he wanted to see what was
[36:08] going on he wanted to make sure she was
[36:10] giv the best and that she was doing her
[36:12] best Now read this now when every maid's
[36:14] turn was come to go to king asaurus
[36:17] after that she had been 12 months
[36:19] according to the manner of the women for
[36:21] so were the days of their
[36:22] purification if you want to read that
[36:24] you don't have to pull it up but it's
[36:25] strongs 47 95 and
[36:28] 4838 IP means a purification the
[36:30] scouring of the people are the women for
[36:33] were the days of their purification
[36:34] accomplished to it 6 months with the oil
[36:37] of myrr now what does myrr
[36:39] mean gold frankincense right
[36:42] myrrh my means death deity dedicated to
[36:46] death all right so you got to die out 6
[36:48] months with sweet odors and with other
[36:51] things for the purifying of the women
[36:54] then thus came every Maiden un the king
[37:00] remember the prophet said there's been
[37:01] Brides brides churches brides and
[37:03] churches right there's been all kind of
[37:07] people trying to present their s to the
[37:08] king
[37:10] yeah and whatsoever she desired was
[37:13] given her to go with her out of the
[37:15] house of the
[37:16] women under the King's house in the
[37:21] evening she
[37:24] went and on the tomorrow she returned
[37:26] turned into the second house of the
[37:27] women to the custody of shagar the
[37:30] king's
[37:31] Chamberlain which kept the
[37:34] concubines all
[37:36] right now that word Shaz God has got a
[37:39] good meaning to it it means servant of
[37:42] the
[37:45] beautiful the king's Chamberlain which
[37:47] kept the concubines she came in under
[37:49] the king no more except the king
[37:51] delighted in her and then she was called
[37:53] by name do you understand what it's
[37:54] doing it's saying that these women would
[37:56] would go see the king at in the evening
[37:59] time and if he if he liked what he
[38:04] saw he would call her by
[38:07] name and she would come
[38:10] back she came into the king no more
[38:13] except the king delighted in her and she
[38:15] was called by name
[38:17] yeah got it yes she came no more to the
[38:22] king except the king called her by
[38:25] name
[38:27] now when the turn of Esther the daughter
[38:28] of Abigail the uncle of Mori who had
[38:31] taken her for his daughter was come to
[38:33] go into the king she required
[38:37] nothing but what the word gave her right
[38:42] remember that's ha guy
[38:45] right nothing else the prophet of God
[38:47] said she required nothing else she
[38:49] didn't require earbobs or pained face or
[38:53] tight dress that's what he was saying in
[38:55] quotes that we got but I'm I'm just kind
[38:57] of cutting the quotes out but just kind
[39:00] of get you to look at the Book of Esther
[39:01] and see that it was it's a beautiful
[39:04] picture of even if you break it down a
[39:06] little bit more of how you and I are
[39:08] supposed to act and about the the um the
[39:10] seven steps like we're talking about
[39:11] downstairs and the statue of a perfect
[39:13] man and the things she had to get to
[39:15] that place she had to get to a place to
[39:18] where the king called her
[39:20] name and it was not ashamed to call her
[39:22] name see now when the turn of Esther
[39:25] came the daughter of Abigail the uncle
[39:26] taking her for daughter was come to go
[39:28] into the king she required nothing but
[39:30] what hagga the king's Chamberlain The
[39:31] Keeper of the women appointed and Esther
[39:34] obtained favor in the sight of all
[39:37] them not just the king she obtained
[39:42] favor of all of them that looked upon
[39:45] her all
[39:47] right so Esther was taken under the king
[39:51] into his house Royal in the 10th month
[39:53] which is the month tth in the seventh
[39:56] year of of his
[39:57] Reign seventh why' it have to be the
[40:00] seventh why couldn't it have been the
[40:02] fourth or the sixth or the eighth or the
[40:05] 12th in the seventh year of his Reign
[40:08] this bride shows up and she's so
[40:11] beautiful right she just knocks him off
[40:14] of his feet right and the King loved
[40:17] Esther above all the women and she
[40:20] obtained grace and favor in his sight
[40:22] more than all the
[40:23] virgins so that he set the royal Crown
[40:26] he didn't even let her leave the palace
[40:28] and come
[40:32] back he put the crown on her right there
[40:35] yeah so he set the Royal Crown upon her
[40:37] head and made her Queen instead of
[40:40] vashti then the king made a great feast
[40:42] under all his princes and servants even
[40:44] Esther's
[40:46] Feast see what God does God presents the
[40:49] bride and he wants all the attention to
[40:52] what the bride he doesn't want all the
[40:54] attention to him my goodness he created
[40:57] the world what else do we need yeah but
[41:00] he wants to present the bride and show
[41:02] it in this in this story of Esther he
[41:04] wants to show how that you and I have
[41:07] come to a place that this King loves us
[41:10] so much
[41:12] right and he is he's self-sufficient he
[41:16] can know all and do all but he doesn't
[41:18] want to do that he wants to listen to
[41:21] the chamberlains he wants to listen to
[41:23] The Messengers he wants to listen to
[41:25] even he's going to listen to here in a
[41:27] minute and like I said you'd think this
[41:29] king didn't have no
[41:30] sense but he had but he was one of the
[41:33] greatest Kings in this story he was one
[41:35] of the greatest kings that ever reigned
[41:38] because what did he do he wanted the
[41:39] other people to get the honor he wanted
[41:42] the other people to get the glory all
[41:44] right then the king made a great feast
[41:46] into all his princes and his servant
[41:47] even Esther's feast and he made a
[41:49] release to the provinces and gave gifts
[41:51] according to the state of the king he
[41:53] was kind of happy amen and when the ver
[41:56] were gathered together the second time
[41:58] then Mori sat at the king's gate now see
[42:01] Mori didn't leave he's still there
[42:03] that's right cuz
[42:04] remember there's a problem coming
[42:07] up and she needs
[42:12] Mori right yes there's a problem coming
[42:16] and she's going to need Mori she can't
[42:18] talk to the
[42:19] king she got to talk to Mori first right
[42:22] all right Esther had not yet showed her
[42:24] Kindred nor people as Mori had charged
[42:27] her see what did Esther look at Esther
[42:30] Esther was
[42:32] always she she she did what Mori said
[42:36] she was not a rebellious child that's
[42:43] right for Esther did the Commandment of
[42:45] Mori right like as when we she was
[42:48] brought up with him in other words she
[42:51] listened to what he said and then did
[42:52] what he said all right and that caught
[42:56] favor with Mori and also you'll see in a
[43:00] minute with the king in those days while
[43:02] Mori said at the king's gate two of the
[43:03] king's chamberlains big them and terish
[43:06] of those which kept the door were wroth
[43:08] and sought to lay hands on King aorus
[43:10] now what happened is this is going to be
[43:12] into the natural story of where Mori
[43:15] hears these two guys trying to take over
[43:18] the kingdom and what's going to happen
[43:21] is Mori is going to hear this and then
[43:25] Mori is going to go back mhm and he's
[43:28] going to tell it to
[43:31] Esther and Esther's going to tell it to
[43:33] the King right all right in those days
[43:36] while Mori sat in the king's gate two of
[43:38] the Kings chamberlains beIN and terish
[43:40] of those who kept the door were wroth
[43:41] and sought to lay hands on King of sorus
[43:44] and the thing was known to Mori he had
[43:46] some
[43:50] discernment who told it unto Esther the
[43:52] queen right whatever I get from God
[43:55] brother BR said I'm going to tell you
[43:57] amen right I I like what brother Claude
[44:00] said the other day brother Claude said
[44:02] I'm glad brother brand you know brother
[44:03] BR said I can't keep a secret remember
[44:05] he said when he said I can't keep a
[44:06] secret well I'm glad he couldn't
[44:09] right amen I'm glad he couldn't keep a
[44:12] secret cuz whatever God told him he told
[44:14] us he couldn't keep a secret thank God
[44:18] that's kind of one way that you it's all
[44:20] right to tell those things like that and
[44:22] the thing was known to Mori who told it
[44:24] unto Esther the queen and certified the
[44:26] king there of in mori's
[44:31] name and when Inquisition was made of
[44:34] the matter it was found out therefore
[44:35] they were both hanged on the tree and it
[44:37] was written in the book of Chronicles
[44:38] before the
[44:40] king
[44:42] now that's going to go in a
[44:44] book and that's going to be left over to
[44:46] the side this is a natural story all
[44:48] right but it's going to have an
[44:50] implication here in just a few minutes
[44:52] all right Esther chapter 3 after these
[44:54] things the king of sorus PR hmon the son
[44:56] of hamadaa the agite and advanced him
[45:00] now the word hmon means
[45:03] magnificent now
[45:07] hmon kind of sounds
[45:10] like
[45:13] ham
[45:15] Hamman remember ham was the
[45:19] right one that did the
[45:22] sinning so hmon we're going to he's
[45:24] going to be the devil from now
[45:27] all right so hmon but he was
[45:29] beautiful because remember the king
[45:31] promoted
[45:33] him you say how's that work
[45:36] out God promoted the
[45:40] devil did he not made him as number one
[45:44] right-hand
[45:45] Man song leader
[45:52] yeah
[45:54] anointed but after these
[45:56] that but that's the truth it's what
[45:58] brother Ram said it was his song leader
[45:59] he was he's anointed he's an anointed
[46:01] cherub he's the one that can anoint you
[46:03] to do the wrong thing all right and
[46:05] after these things did King ofur promote
[46:07] hmon the son of ham hamadaa the agot and
[46:10] advanced him and set seal upon all seat
[46:13] above all the princes that were with him
[46:16] and all the king's servants that were in
[46:17] the king's gate bowed in reverence
[46:20] hmon but one guy
[46:24] yeah one guy this guy was always a thorn
[46:27] in Hon's flesh and all the king's
[46:30] servants that were in the king's gate
[46:32] bowed in reverence hmon for the king had
[46:35] so commanded concerning him but Mori
[46:38] bowed not nor did him any
[46:40] reverence he didn't like that right then
[46:44] the king's servants which were in the
[46:45] king's gate said unto Mori why
[46:47] transgressed thou the king's
[46:50] commandment all
[46:54] right now came to pass when they spoke
[46:57] daily unto
[46:58] him he didn't answer that
[47:01] question he didn't have
[47:04] to he didn't answer that it just goes
[47:06] down and says now it came to pass they
[47:08] asked him H why are you doing this now
[47:10] it came to pass when they spake daily
[47:12] unto him and he hearkened not unto them
[47:14] that they told hmon to see where the
[47:16] mori's matter would stand for he had
[47:18] told them that he was a Jew all right so
[47:21] he told him he was different he had a
[47:23] different lineage and when hmon saw that
[47:25] Mori bowed not nor did him any reverence
[47:28] then was hmon full of
[47:30] Wrath so this little man on the scene
[47:33] here he's not giving the devil any
[47:36] credit all right and and the devil's mad
[47:39] about this all right and he thought
[47:42] scorned to lay hands on morai alone for
[47:44] he had showed him the people of morai
[47:47] wherefore hmon sought to destroy all the
[47:48] Jews so now hmon knows that the Jews are
[47:53] that close that Mori is a Jew
[47:57] but now he's going to find out also
[47:59] about Esther all
[48:02] right cuz God don't tell his secrets to
[48:04] everybody right that were throughout the
[48:06] whole Kingdom of asaurus even the people
[48:09] of Mori which is the Jews so now what
[48:11] hmon has got to do hmon has devised a
[48:13] plan Mori has made him so mad he's found
[48:16] out he was a Jew so he's going to kill
[48:18] the Jews to get back at Mori right all
[48:21] right ain't that the way the devil does
[48:23] oh yeah he's that way all the time
[48:26] you do something good he's going to try
[48:27] to make you do something bad to get back
[48:29] to thing you done good all right so
[48:32] here's the devil and here's
[48:35] Mori and then Esther's fixing to pop up
[48:37] in just a minute in the first month that
[48:39] is the month Nissen in the 12th year of
[48:41] King of Swords they cast poor which
[48:44] that's where purum is going to come from
[48:45] they cast poor that is the lot before
[48:48] hmon from day to day and from month to
[48:49] month to the 12th month that is the
[48:51] month Adar let's keep reading and hmon
[48:53] said unto King ofor there is a certain
[48:57] people
[49:01] right they're scattered abroad and
[49:03] dispersed right despised and
[49:08] rejected amen I want to be part of that
[49:12] group right I don't care I like that the
[49:14] devil don't like
[49:16] me all right and hon said into King ofus
[49:19] there's a certain people scattered
[49:22] abroad and dispersed among the people in
[49:24] all the provinces of thy kingdom and thy
[49:28] their laws are diverse from all people
[49:33] yeah neither keep they the king's law
[49:36] therefore it is not for the king's
[49:38] Prophet to suffer them now they did keep
[49:40] the law he was lying they did remember
[49:44] it says here they were at ease they did
[49:46] keep the law that's why they stayed
[49:47] where they were all right if it please
[49:50] the king Let It Be written that they may
[49:51] be destroyed and I will pay 10,000
[49:53] talents of silver to the hands of those
[49:55] that have the charge of the business to
[49:56] bring it into the king's Treasury and
[49:59] the King took his ring from his hand now
[50:01] you think boy this is something now
[50:02] watch the king took his ring from his
[50:04] hand and gave it to
[50:06] hmon now remember the Lord knows what
[50:08] he's doing oh yeah cuz
[50:11] remember you say how can you type that
[50:14] now did not God say hey
[50:17] devil you you remember my servant
[50:23] job in other words he said say
[50:26] take my ring in other words take what
[50:28] you can go down there and just do what
[50:29] you want to with him he brought job up
[50:33] to the devil he said hey satan if you if
[50:36] you you can wellow you got a hedge
[50:38] around him well watch this the king took
[50:40] his ring from his hand and gave it to
[50:41] hmon the son of Heda the Jews enemy and
[50:45] the King said unto hmon the silver is
[50:46] given to thee the people also to do with
[50:48] him as it seemed good to thee then were
[50:52] the king scribes called on the 13th day
[50:54] of the first month and there was written
[50:55] according to all that hmon had commanded
[50:57] to the king's lieutenants and governors
[50:59] that were in every Province and ruler of
[51:00] every people of every Province according
[51:02] to the writings thereof to every people
[51:03] after their language in the name of King
[51:05] it was written and sealed with the
[51:06] king's ring now what was
[51:08] it it was
[51:10] sent to kill and
[51:13] destroy cuz remember when the church AG
[51:17] messenger sent his letters out and sent
[51:19] his sermons out there was a copy behind
[51:22] it oh yeah Satan's always a copycat
[51:25] right so what's happening here these
[51:27] letters are being sent out to
[51:30] kill and to cause to perish all Jews
[51:33] both young and old little children and
[51:36] women in one day
[51:40] now when is Israel going to be
[51:42] born in a day but he was going to kill
[51:45] them in a day you see how this is going
[51:47] to flipflop here especially on hymon and
[51:50] the letters were sent by post into all
[51:52] the king's Province to destroy to kill
[51:54] to cause to perish all Jew Jews both
[51:55] young and small and women in one day
[51:57] even until the 13th day of the 12th
[51:59] month which is the month Adar and to
[52:01] take the spoil of them for a
[52:03] prey so now the decree is
[52:07] written and sealed with the king's
[52:10] Ring It Was Written In The Name of the
[52:12] King and seal with the king's ring right
[52:16] but now remember the king didn't do it
[52:20] no the king didn't do it he gave the
[52:23] ring to hmon he gave the writing to some
[52:25] the other the other people all right the
[52:27] copy of the writings for a commandment
[52:29] to be given in every Province was
[52:30] published unto all the people that they
[52:31] should be ready against that day what
[52:33] hmon was going to do is he was going to
[52:35] go and kill the Jews in one day he was
[52:37] going to kill that race of people in one
[52:42] day now the post went out being hastened
[52:45] by the king's commandment and the decree
[52:47] was given in shushan the palace and the
[52:48] king and hmon sat down to drink but the
[52:51] city shushan was
[52:53] perplexed all right so this is where we
[52:55] go
[52:58] into watch Mori when morai perceived all
[53:03] that was
[53:04] done now Mori wasn't
[53:07] there so this little guy must have a
[53:09] little
[53:10] discernment cuz he perceived all that
[53:12] was being
[53:14] done Mori rent his clothes and put on
[53:16] sackcloth with ashes and went out in the
[53:18] midst of the city and cry with a loud
[53:21] and bitter
[53:22] cry but now watch
[53:25] and came even before the king's gate for
[53:27] none might enter into the king's gate
[53:29] clothed with sackcloth and then he sees
[53:31] all this and in every Province
[53:34] whatsoever the king's commandment his
[53:35] decree came there was a great mourning
[53:37] among the Jews and fasting and weeping
[53:38] and wailing and many laying sackcloth
[53:40] and Ashes so Esther's Maiden her
[53:42] Chamberlain came and told it to her then
[53:45] was the queen exceedingly grieved and
[53:48] she sent Raymond to clothe Mori and take
[53:50] away a sackcloth from him but he
[53:52] received it not then called Esther for
[53:55] hatch one of the king's Chamberlain who
[53:57] had appointed to attend upon her and
[53:59] gave him a commandment to Mori to know
[54:02] what it was and why it was so hatx went
[54:05] forth to morai into the street of the
[54:06] city which was before the king's gate
[54:09] and morai told him of all that had
[54:10] happened unto him of the sum of money
[54:12] that hmon had promised to pay for the
[54:13] king's treasure for the Jews to destroy
[54:16] them also he gave him a copy of the
[54:18] writings of the decree that was given at
[54:20] shushan to destroy them to show it into
[54:23] Esther and declare mared unto her and to
[54:26] charge her that she should go in un the
[54:28] king now why did Mori go he wasn't the
[54:31] bride right he wasn't the bride he was
[54:35] part of the family but he wasn't the
[54:37] bride so he had to get a message to
[54:41] Esther how to approach the
[54:43] king cuz remember without Esther being
[54:47] called she could be killed you had to be
[54:50] called or summoned by the king or you or
[54:53] you had to be or you were killed also he
[54:54] gave gave him the copy of the writings
[54:55] of the decree given to shushan to
[54:57] destroy them to show it unto Esther and
[54:59] declare it unto her to charge her that
[55:01] she should go in unto the king to make
[55:03] supplication unto
[55:06] him and make requests before him for her
[55:10] people
[55:11] right you see why Esther's so great as
[55:14] far as even just a person she wasn't
[55:16] thinking about her anymore after this
[55:18] what she found out what hmon was going
[55:20] to
[55:21] do she had compassion for her own people
[55:25] and hatch came and told Esther the words
[55:27] of Mori that's right again Esther spake
[55:31] you missed one go back
[55:33] down again Esther spake unto hatch and
[55:36] gave him commandment unto Mori all the
[55:39] king servant and the people the king's
[55:41] Province do know that whatsoever whether
[55:42] the man or woman shall come into the
[55:44] king to the inner Court who is not
[55:46] called there is one law of his to put
[55:48] him to death except such whom the king
[55:51] shall hold out the golden seer right
[55:54] that he may live but I have not been
[55:56] called to come into the king for 30
[56:01] days but he's not going to forget
[56:04] her and they told to Mori Esther's words
[56:07] then Mori commanded to answer Esther
[56:10] think not with thyself right that thou
[56:13] shalt Escape in the King's house more
[56:15] than all the Jews right for if thou
[56:17] altogether holdest thy peace at this
[56:23] time then shall there enlargement and
[56:25] deliverance arise to the Jews from
[56:27] another place but thy and thy father's
[56:30] house shall be destroyed and who knowest
[56:33] whether Thou Art come to the king for
[56:34] such a time as this what's Mori telling
[56:37] her he's showing her her position right
[56:40] who knowest whether Thou Art come to
[56:43] this Kingdom for such a time as this
[56:47] right in other words he was telling
[56:50] Esther this is what you were brought
[56:52] here for amen this is what you were
[56:55] brought into all this was to go and try
[56:59] to save your people then Esther B them
[57:03] return Mori this
[57:04] answer go gather together all the Jews
[57:08] that are present in shushan and fast ye
[57:10] for me neither eat nor drink these day
[57:13] or night I also and my maidens will Fast
[57:15] likewise and so will I go in unto the
[57:17] King which is not according to the law
[57:20] and if I
[57:21] perish I perish amen
[57:26] God I got nothing else I'm coming to you
[57:29] uh nothing I can bring and hadn't seen
[57:32] him for 30
[57:34] days that's what she said she he hadn't
[57:37] called me for 30 days if I perish I
[57:40] perish so Mori went his way and did
[57:43] according to all that Esther had
[57:44] commanded him now it came to pass on the
[57:47] third
[57:49] day kind of something about these third
[57:52] days and seven days right on the third
[57:54] day
[57:55] Esther put on her royal
[57:59] apparel dad just got finished with that
[58:01] in Revelations 19
[58:03] right cuz remember she's not a bride
[58:06] anymore she's his wife amen but she
[58:08] still got to put on that
[58:10] garment cuz she knows that King wants to
[58:13] see her if she's going to see the king
[58:14] she didn't have on curlers and
[58:16] flipflops
[58:23] right she
[58:26] didn't you know that's how you get in
[58:28] trouble a lot and I'm like Daddy and he
[58:31] got in trouble and I guess I'll get in
[58:32] trouble too but you know your sisters
[58:34] you put on your best and you put on
[58:35] everything you got to go work for your
[58:37] boss but when your husband comes
[58:45] home
[58:49] anyway but
[58:51] Esther but Esther knew what to put on
[58:54] right amen she was at a place where
[58:57] somebody didn't have to tell her she
[58:59] she's not conferring with anybody right
[59:01] here right she's going at this alone but
[59:05] she knows from her past experience come
[59:07] on somebody they know you know from your
[59:09] past experience how to approach God
[59:12] right she knows how to approach this
[59:14] King in a way where he can't turn her
[59:17] down now wouldn't you do that if it was
[59:21] my life dependent on it and I'd already
[59:23] been his wife for a long time
[59:25] I ought to know what pleases him and I'm
[59:28] going to put that on if he hates red and
[59:31] green together I'm not going out there
[59:32] with red and green
[59:34] on if he loves blue I'm going to be blue
[59:37] from head to toe but that's what she
[59:39] done she put on her royal apparel amen
[59:42] not somebody else's she put on hers
[59:45] right and stood in the inner Court of
[59:47] the King's
[59:48] house outer Court inner court she
[59:52] couldn't go into the holy of holies yet
[59:54] right she had to be asked to come in
[59:58] right and the inner Court of the King's
[1:00:00] house over against the King's house and
[1:00:02] the King sat upon his Royal Throne the
[1:00:03] King was in the palace
[1:00:06] right in the Royal house over against
[1:00:08] the Gate of the house and it was so when
[1:00:11] the king saw
[1:00:16] Esther the queen standing in the
[1:00:19] court that she obtained favor in his
[1:00:23] sight yeah
[1:00:25] amen glory oh he hadn't seen us with his
[1:00:29] eyes yet not his physical eyes but when
[1:00:33] he does when he sees us when we go meet
[1:00:37] him in the Air Buddy there's going to be
[1:00:38] a
[1:00:39] meeting she obtained favor in his sight
[1:00:43] and the King held out to Esther the
[1:00:45] goldm scepter that was in his hand so
[1:00:47] Esther Drew near and touch the top of
[1:00:49] the scepter then said the king unto her
[1:00:52] now do you know what a scepter is
[1:00:55] most scepter in the olden times were a
[1:01:00] ball and there was a cross on top of
[1:01:04] it now we don't know that's what
[1:01:06] happened but I'm going to say that's
[1:01:07] what happened
[1:01:09] yeah cuzz that's what that's the only
[1:01:11] way we can approach God Is by The
[1:01:14] Cross so Esther Drew near and touched
[1:01:16] the top of the scepter then said the
[1:01:17] king unto her What wilt thou Queen
[1:01:21] Esther he didn't hesitate he said what
[1:01:25] do you need and what is thy request and
[1:01:29] it shall even given the shall be given
[1:01:32] be even given thee to half now listen if
[1:01:36] we get to this if we don't we may stop
[1:01:37] and do it some other time cuz there's a
[1:01:39] great story that keeps on going all the
[1:01:41] way into where Mori is is put up in a
[1:01:44] position but we'll maybe not get to that
[1:01:46] cuz we I don't want to hold you too long
[1:01:48] so maybe we'll stop in just a minute but
[1:01:50] it shall be given to thee under half the
[1:01:51] kingdom but now remember he says that
[1:01:53] twice
[1:01:55] but when he gets to the very end when
[1:01:57] all this is over and haymon's dead and
[1:01:59] Hon's sons are killed and uh
[1:02:01] everything's restored back to order he
[1:02:03] walks up to Esther and he says Esther
[1:02:05] what do you
[1:02:06] want he didn't say up until half the
[1:02:09] Kingdom right he says whatever you
[1:02:13] ask that's what you'll get and Esther
[1:02:16] answered and said if it seemed good unto
[1:02:19] the
[1:02:21] king watch
[1:02:23] her she's not some dumb
[1:02:27] kid she know who's she knows who the
[1:02:29] problem
[1:02:31] is it's the
[1:02:33] devil and she's fixing set a trap for
[1:02:36] him and Esther answered if it seemed
[1:02:39] good unto the king let the king and hmon
[1:02:41] come this day into the banquet that I
[1:02:43] have prepared for him then the king said
[1:02:47] cause hmon to make haste that he may do
[1:02:49] as asther has
[1:02:53] said
[1:02:55] so the king and hmon came to the banquet
[1:02:57] that
[1:02:58] Esther had

[1:03:46] heart but there was another guy there
[1:03:49] but when hmon saw Mori in the king's
[1:03:51] gate that he stood not up nor moved for
[1:03:54] him he was full of indignation against
[1:03:56] Mori nevertheless hmon refrained himself
[1:04:00] wasn't time and when he came home he
[1:04:02] sent and call for his friends and zarus
[1:04:04] his wife you always got like Dad said
[1:04:08] you never sin

[1:04:16] spirits of those devils are are there
[1:04:18] Satan's subjects I mean they're Satan's

[1:04:21] Satan's got a family but you're going to
[1:04:23] see Satan's family destroyed here and
[1:04:25] hmon told them of the glory of these
[1:04:26] riches and the multitude of his children
[1:04:28] and all the things wherein the king had
[1:04:30] promoted him and how he had Advanced him
[1:04:32] above the princes and Servants of the
[1:04:34] king you see how the devil is he he
[1:04:37] thinks he can do something he thinks he
[1:04:39] thinks he's got some power hmon said
[1:04:41] moreover yay Esther the queen did not
[1:04:43] let no man come in with the King into
[1:04:45] the banquet that she had prepared but
[1:04:48] myself she was setting a trap for him
[1:04:51] and tomorrow am I invited unto her also
[1:04:53] with the the king yet all this availeth
[1:04:56] me nothing so long as I see that nasty
[1:04:59] guy Mori the Jew sitting at the king's
[1:05:02] gate then said zarus his wife and all
[1:05:05] his
[1:05:06] friends let a Gallow be made of 50
[1:05:10] cubics high tomorrow speak thou unto the
[1:05:12] king that Mori may be hang there on then
[1:05:15] go thou merrily with the King into the
[1:05:17] banquet and the thing pleased hmon and
[1:05:18] he caused The Gallows to be made so you
[1:05:21] see what's happening Hon's familyes even
[1:05:24] getting involved and his wife is
[1:05:26] involved saying hey kill this
[1:05:29] guy he didn't have enough guts to do it
[1:05:31] but I guess his wife
[1:05:34] did there's a thought there on that
[1:05:37] night could not the king
[1:05:40] sleep and he commanded to bring the book
[1:05:42] of records of the chronicle and they
[1:05:44] were read before the
[1:05:45] king and it was found
[1:05:48] written
[1:05:50] epistle that Mori had told of the two
[1:05:53] guys that that were that were uh
[1:05:56] conspiring to kill him they sought to
[1:05:58] lay hands on the king and the King said
[1:06:01] what honor and dignity has been done to
[1:06:03] Mori for this in other words what have
[1:06:05] we done for this guy I I don't remember
[1:06:07] it but now I've brought back to my
[1:06:08] memory I I'm you know the Lord said
[1:06:11] bring back the things to his remembrance
[1:06:12] you know all right then said the king's
[1:06:15] servants that ministered unto him
[1:06:17] there's nothing we done for him and the
[1:06:19] King said who is in the court now hmon
[1:06:22] was come he's got bad times
[1:06:24] here a couple of times he's got real bad
[1:06:27] timing but the devil's got some pretty
[1:06:29] bad timing now hmon was coming to the
[1:06:31] outward Court of the King's house to
[1:06:32] speak unto the king to hang Mori on the
[1:06:34] Galla that he had prepared for him now
[1:06:36] he was fixing to concoct some story and
[1:06:39] actually he was fixing to tell the king
[1:06:41] and he was a Jew cuz hmon knew that all
[1:06:45] right and the King's servant said unto
[1:06:47] him behold hmon standeth in the court
[1:06:49] and the King says let him come
[1:06:51] in so hmon came in and the King said
[1:06:53] unto him what shall be done unto the man
[1:06:56] whom the king delighteth to honor
[1:07:01] yeah now the devil thought in his heart
[1:07:04] to whom would the king Delight to do
[1:07:06] honor more than
[1:07:07] me you see all that I me me me stuff you
[1:07:11] know that's not a
[1:07:12] servant that's not a servant attitude
[1:07:15] this whole hmon guy has got the devil
[1:07:18] just I mean he's got him right just the
[1:07:20] character is perfect I wish they'd make
[1:07:22] a movie out of this I mean they made
[1:07:24] parts of a movie but they ought to make
[1:07:25] one totally by the Bible when hmon
[1:07:28] thought in his heart to whom would the
[1:07:29] king Delight to do honor more than
[1:07:31] myself and hymon answerers the King for
[1:07:33] the man whom the king delighted to honor
[1:07:35] let the Royal apparel be brought which
[1:07:38] the King used to wear and let the horse
[1:07:39] at the king rides on yeah a white
[1:07:43] one and the Crown Royal which is set
[1:07:46] upon his head and let this apparel and
[1:07:48] horse be delivered to the hands of one
[1:07:50] of King's most noble
[1:07:52] princes
[1:07:54] H yeah that he may array the man with
[1:07:57] all whom the king delighted to honor and
[1:08:00] bring him on Horseback through the
[1:08:02] streets of the city and Proclaim
[1:08:03] Proclaim therefore him thus shall it be
[1:08:06] done to the man who the king delighted
[1:08:08] the honor and the King said to hmon make
[1:08:13] haste take the apparel and the horse as
[1:08:16] thou H has said and do even so to Mori
[1:08:18] now about that time the devil's face is
[1:08:21] turning
[1:08:22] red more than it is is
[1:08:25] read that he thought he was going to get
[1:08:28] all this glory and H now you know this
[1:08:30] is the character what watch in all the
[1:08:34] things of of Satan even in the Old
[1:08:36] Testament and the New Testament watch he
[1:08:38] sits in the temple of God showing
[1:08:39] himself to be as God here Satan that
[1:08:41] exalted
[1:08:43] himself remember there in in Ezekiel
[1:08:45] where Satan had exalted himself the
[1:08:47] prince of tire and all that you know
[1:08:49] this is the Devil Himself just doing
[1:08:51] this but now look God's fixing the to
[1:08:53] pull a fast one on him
[1:08:55] here and let nothing fail of all that
[1:08:58] thou has
[1:09:00] spoken he was doing what the devil said
[1:09:03] to do you see how God's going to honor
[1:09:05] his people and that's right because the
[1:09:07] devil is our best he is he's the best
[1:09:11] guy to get us to go to God that's right
[1:09:14] he he's the best one there's nobody else
[1:09:16] can do it right he's the only one that
[1:09:18] can drive us to God the only one all
[1:09:22] right and that's just it is cuz the king
[1:09:24] said unto hmon then took hmon the
[1:09:26] apparel and the horse and raid Mori now
[1:09:28] you think this guy didn't want to kill
[1:09:29] him and brought him on Horseback through
[1:09:33] the street of the city and proclaimed
[1:09:34] before him thus shall it be done unto
[1:09:36] the man who the king delighteth the
[1:09:38] honor and Mori came again into the
[1:09:41] king's gate but hmon hasted to his house
[1:09:44] crying and having his head covered he
[1:09:46] was embarrassed and hmon told zerus his
[1:09:49] wife and all his friends his wife and
[1:09:51] his friends everything that befallen him
[1:09:55] wi he wise he woo then said his wise men
[1:09:58] and zarth his wife unto him if Mori be
[1:10:00] of the seed of the Jews before him who
[1:10:02] has begun to fall Thou shalt not Prevail
[1:10:05] against him but Thou shalt surely fall
[1:10:07] before him look at they're prophesying
[1:10:08] against their own
[1:10:11] right he can't
[1:10:13] win even his own family it's prophesying
[1:10:17] against
[1:10:19] him and while they were yet talking with
[1:10:21] him came the King's chamberlains and
[1:10:23] hasted to bring hmon into the banquet
[1:10:25] that Esther had prepared now let's get
[1:10:26] back to the banquet so the king and hmon
[1:10:28] came to the banquet with Esther the
[1:10:30] queen so here's all the
[1:10:32] players you got the king you got hmon
[1:10:35] and you got Esther that's right all
[1:10:37] right so you got so you got the Lord you
[1:10:40] got the devil and you got the bride
[1:10:42] right all right and the King said unto
[1:10:44] Esther on the second day at the banquet
[1:10:46] of wine I like that banquet of wine
[1:10:48] we're fixing to take
[1:10:49] communion but wine is a representation
[1:10:52] of what the Holy Spirit all right what
[1:10:54] is thy petition Queen Esther and it
[1:10:56] shall be granted unto them what is thy
[1:10:57] request and it shall be formed even to
[1:10:59] half the kingdom here he is telling her
[1:11:01] half the kingdom again then Esther the
[1:11:03] queen answered and said if I have found
[1:11:05] favor in thy side oh
[1:11:07] King and if it pleased the king look at
[1:11:09] her servant life and if it please the
[1:11:12] king let my life be given me at my
[1:11:15] petition and my people at my request now
[1:11:19] here she's telling
[1:11:21] him I'm a Jew right
[1:11:24] for we are
[1:11:25] sold I and my people to be destroyed to
[1:11:29] be slain and to
[1:11:30] perish but if we had been sold for Bond
[1:11:33] men and bond women I had held my tongue
[1:11:35] although the enemy could not countervail
[1:11:38] the king's damage now what she's saying
[1:11:41] is the King's already said
[1:11:43] it and there's nothing she can do about
[1:11:45] it unless the king reverse it that's
[1:11:47] right but now the king's fixing to tell
[1:11:49] her he can't reverse it once it's
[1:11:52] written it's it's written you can't take
[1:11:55] it back all right but now look but King
[1:11:58] aurus answers and said unto Esther the
[1:12:00] queen who is he and where is he that dur
[1:12:04] presume in his heart to do
[1:12:06] so and Esther said the adversarii and
[1:12:09] enemy is this wicked hmon yeah then hmon
[1:12:13] was afraid before the king and the queen
[1:12:16] he wasn't just afraid of the
[1:12:18] king y he was not just afraid of the
[1:12:21] king at this point right
[1:12:24] the lord the devil and the bride he's
[1:12:26] not just afraid of the King right now
[1:12:28] he's afraid of the king and the queen
[1:12:31] right cuz he has been listening to the
[1:12:33] conversation Esther saying if it please
[1:12:36] you do this if it please you do this you
[1:12:38] hear the words coming forth and the King
[1:12:41] arises from the banquet of wine and his
[1:12:43] wrath and went into the palace garden
[1:12:45] and hmon stood up to make requests for
[1:12:46] his life to
[1:12:49] who not the
[1:12:51] king where the devil 's worst enemy
[1:12:54] right we are he can talk to God he can
[1:12:59] understand what God's doing kind of sort
[1:13:01] of a little bit but he just can't
[1:13:03] understand us that's right I don't think
[1:13:04] he can cuz we were once his partner we
[1:13:07] were once in his family right and now
[1:13:10] we're over here acting a different way
[1:13:11] yet we're in the same
[1:13:13] body so we're a paradox to
[1:13:16] him for he saw that there was evil look
[1:13:19] and hmon stood up to make requests for
[1:13:20] his life to Esther he didn't go out
[1:13:22] there to the king he went to Esther yeah
[1:13:25] for he saw that there was evil
[1:13:27] determined against him by the king he
[1:13:30] was thinking if I can get Esther on my
[1:13:32] side see how the devil is if I can get
[1:13:35] Esther on my side she can petition the
[1:13:37] king to save my
[1:13:38] life
[1:13:40] not then the king returned out of the
[1:13:43] palace Garden into the place of the
[1:13:44] banquet of wine and hmon was Fallen upon
[1:13:46] the bed where Esther was bad
[1:13:51] mistake bad mistake
[1:13:54] then said the king will he Force the
[1:13:56] queen also before me in the house he
[1:13:58] might have had a chance at first but
[1:14:01] when he goes to messing with the
[1:14:03] bride when Satan goes to messing with
[1:14:05] the bride that God's not going to pull
[1:14:08] he's not going to pull no
[1:14:10] punches as the word went out of his
[1:14:14] mouth they covered Hon's
[1:14:18] face and harbona one of the Chamberlain
[1:14:20] said before the king behold also the
[1:14:22] Gallow 50 ft which hmon had made for
[1:14:25] Mori he's telling him what's going on
[1:14:28] now who had spoken good for the king
[1:14:30] standeth in the house of hmon then the
[1:14:32] king said hang him there on right so
[1:14:36] they hanged hmon on The Gallows that he
[1:14:38] had prepared for Mori then was the
[1:14:40] king's
[1:14:41] wrath pacified now to finish the story
[1:14:44] right here real quick I'm not going to
[1:14:46] do the rest of it but what happened was
[1:14:48] Now esther has
[1:14:50] come and Mori now look let's let's read
[1:14:53] this on that day did the king of sorus
[1:14:55] give the house of hmon the Jews enemy
[1:14:57] unto Esther the
[1:15:01] queen and Mori came before the king for
[1:15:04] Esther had
[1:15:06] told what he was unto her and the King
[1:15:09] took off his ring which he had taken
[1:15:12] from hmon and gave it to Mori now that
[1:15:15] was the man that needed it right there
[1:15:17] all right there was the adoption signal
[1:15:20] to Mori and Esther set Mori over the
[1:15:24] house of hmon yeah and Esther spake yet
[1:15:26] again before the king and fell down his
[1:15:28] feet and besought him with tears to put
[1:15:29] away the Mischief of hmon the aite and
[1:15:31] his device that he had devised against
[1:15:33] the
[1:15:34] Jews then the king held out the golden
[1:15:36] scepter toward Esther so Esther arose
[1:15:37] and stood before the king and said if it
[1:15:40] please the king and if I have found
[1:15:41] favor in his sight how many times has
[1:15:42] she said that she's reminding God right
[1:15:46] that she has done now if she wasn't
[1:15:47] hadn't done what she said she was do
[1:15:49] going to do she couldn't say that same
[1:15:51] way with you and I if our life don't
[1:15:53] line up you can't go up and say God I've
[1:15:54] done everything I can do if you haven't
[1:15:57] done everything you can do all right and
[1:15:59] she said if it please the king and if I
[1:16:01] have found favor in his sight and the
[1:16:02] things seem right before the king and
[1:16:04] I'll be pleasing in his
[1:16:06] eyes yeah let it be written to reverse
[1:16:10] the letters devised by hmon the son of
[1:16:12] hameda the agot which he wrote to
[1:16:14] destroy the Jews which are in all the
[1:16:15] king's
[1:16:16] provinces for How Can I Endure to see
[1:16:19] the evil that shall come unto my people
[1:16:21] now what happened is when he sent decree
[1:16:24] out the king couldn't take it back right
[1:16:28] but he can make a way right the king hey
[1:16:31] look this is full of condemnation if you
[1:16:33] take it the wrong way this is written
[1:16:35] the written word of God which will kill
[1:16:37] you right that's right right but there's
[1:16:40] Grace
[1:16:41] listen How Can I Endure to see the
[1:16:44] destruction of my Kindred then the king
[1:16:47] ofor said unto Esther the queen and to
[1:16:50] Mori behold I have given Esther the
[1:16:53] house of hmon and to him they have
[1:16:55] hanged upon the Galls because he laid
[1:16:56] his hand upon the
[1:16:58] Jews write ye also for the Jews as it
[1:17:01] liketh you in the king's name and seal
[1:17:04] it with the king's ring for the writing
[1:17:06] which is written in the king's name and
[1:17:08] sealed with the king's Ring May no man
[1:17:10] reverse exactly so it was all written it
[1:17:13] can't be reversed right all right
[1:17:16] but then were the king scribes called in
[1:17:18] at the time of the third month that was
[1:17:20] the month cvon and 3 and 20 days and it
[1:17:22] was written according all that Mori
[1:17:23] commanded to the Jews and to the
[1:17:25] lieutenants and the rulers of the
[1:17:27] provinces were from India to Ethiopia
[1:17:29] 127 provinces every Province the
[1:17:32] writings thereof and to every person of
[1:17:35] their language in other words what what
[1:17:36] is Mori
[1:17:38] doing he's giving them a chance right
[1:17:42] and that's where you see the story that
[1:17:45] God can't reverse his word but he can
[1:17:46] give you a chance what he done was is he
[1:17:49] gave them a chance to defend theel right
[1:17:51] amen he didn't disallow the law he
[1:17:55] actually sent the armies out God said my
[1:17:58] great Army I sent and Joel what to
[1:18:02] destroy but what he's doing is he's
[1:18:05] saying okay I'm going to make a way
[1:18:06] verse 10 and he wrote in the king of s's
[1:18:09] name and sealed it with the king's ring
[1:18:11] and sent letters and posts by horseback
[1:18:13] and Riders on mule camels and young
[1:18:14] dramedies wherein the king granted the
[1:18:16] Jews which were in every city to gather
[1:18:18] themselves together and to stand for
[1:18:20] their life to destroy to slay and cause
[1:18:22] the perish all the power of the people
[1:18:24] and province that would assault them
[1:18:25] both little both little ones and women
[1:18:28] and take the spoil for a
[1:18:30] prey so what happened was all these
[1:18:33] copies went out and they knew the day he
[1:18:36] was
[1:18:37] coming they knew the day that they were
[1:18:39] going to destroy right the
[1:18:42] Israelites but all these posts came out
[1:18:44] and all these letters came out and they
[1:18:46] were able to bring their SEL
[1:18:50] together and to finish the story
[1:18:54] the Jews got together and wiped the
[1:18:56] other Army out right so there was the
[1:18:59] story of Esther petitioning or the only
[1:19:02] chance this world has is the bride amen
[1:19:05] the only chance this world's got is for
[1:19:06] that bride to petition to God and that's
[1:19:09] what we do as as being like Esther we
[1:19:12] come to a place to where we see that
[1:19:15] there is a message that we have
[1:19:18] amen that we can give to the people to
[1:19:21] defend ourself right none of the others
[1:19:23] could defend theirself none of the
[1:19:24] others could do anything except for the
[1:19:26] ones that had that letter that was
[1:19:29] published from Mori and Esther all right
[1:19:32] so then you're going to see that that
[1:19:34] later on in the story in the very
[1:19:37] last that
[1:19:41] Esther in verse 29 go all the way from
[1:19:44] to
[1:19:46] 9:29 and here's what happened to the
[1:19:48] whole story right here right there
[1:19:51] w then estra the Queen the daughter of
[1:19:55] Abigail and Mori the Jew wrote with all
[1:19:59] authority
[1:20:01] yeah
[1:20:03] exactly King's not anywhere to be
[1:20:09] seen you see
[1:20:12] that Esther the Queen the daughter of
[1:20:14] Abigail and Mori the je wrote with all
[1:20:16] authority to confirm this second letter
[1:20:19] which is the letter they sent of
[1:20:21] purum but you see what they've come to a
[1:20:24] position you don't see the king in
[1:20:28] that you see the messenger and you see
[1:20:31] the the bride amen God has given the
[1:20:37] authority to The Queen
[1:20:40] Esther and to
[1:20:42] Mori they wrote with all authority there
[1:20:45] was no looking
[1:20:48] back and look what verse
[1:20:51] 30
[1:20:54] what happened look what they wrote with
[1:20:57] words of what
[1:20:59] peace and Truth
[1:21:03] yeah the whole story comes down to
[1:21:08] peace and Truth
[1:21:11] amen and you can see in chapter
[1:21:16] 10 verse
[1:21:18] two go to chapter 10 which is the last
[1:21:21] chapter verse two and all the acts of
[1:21:23] his power and then the king of sorus
[1:21:25] laid a tribute upon the land and upon
[1:21:26] the aisle and all the acts of his power
[1:21:29] and of his might and the Declaration of
[1:21:30] the greatness of Mori where unto the
[1:21:33] king Advanced him are they not written
[1:21:35] in the book of The Chronicles of the
[1:21:36] kings of media and Persia for Mori the
[1:21:39] Jew was next unto the king and great
[1:21:42] among the Jews and accepted of the
[1:21:45] multitude of his Brethren not just the
[1:21:48] Jews look at
[1:21:50] this seeking the wealth of his people
[1:21:53] people and speaking peace to all his
[1:21:55] seed amen it wasn't he wasn't seeking
[1:21:57] wealth to himself it says seeking the
[1:22:00] wealth of his
[1:22:02] people so here you have a story and
[1:22:05] there's a lot more into this that you
[1:22:06] can go into that for saving time we
[1:22:10] didn't but you see that Esther has come
[1:22:12] to a position to where she was given
[1:22:15] full Authority amen and she was the one
[1:22:19] that
[1:22:20] was speaking the peace and the TR truth
[1:22:22] and all authority was given to them to
[1:22:25] do whatever they needed to do in that
[1:22:27] Kingdom and I wrote in my Bible when I
[1:22:30] was reading this I wrote where's the
[1:22:32] king
[1:22:34] yeah he's in Esther
[1:22:37] right he's in
[1:22:39] Esther he's not anywhere else he's in
[1:22:42] Esther because to give to give somebody
[1:22:44] full Authority you've got they've got to
[1:22:46] have the same mind you got I wouldn't
[1:22:49] give authority to somebody that didn't
[1:22:51] have the same mind that I did so you
[1:22:53] come to the Book of Esther let's stand
[1:22:56] and we see a great group of people but
[1:22:58] you see that those were given to us for
[1:23:01] example to show us that we Glory as
[1:23:06] Esther can go before a king
[1:23:09] right and not change his
[1:23:12] mind he did she didn't change the king's
[1:23:15] mind the king's mind was made right but
[1:23:20] she came forward with an opportunity
[1:23:23] for her
[1:23:24] people to make it right at least Let
[1:23:28] Them Fight for their self and that's
[1:23:30] what you and I have done we've come to
[1:23:32] the time to where at least God at least
[1:23:35] at least give us the ability to fight
[1:23:38] and he has through a five-fold Ministry
[1:23:41] he gives us the ability to fight with
[1:23:44] right Esther man it's a great subject to
[1:23:48] look at and look into and and look at
[1:23:50] all the people's names but
[1:23:53] you know that wasn't in there just to
[1:23:55] fill up space right that was put in
[1:23:57] there to show you and I what a queen is
[1:24:00] supposed to really be like what a queen
[1:24:03] and but now not what just a queen is
[1:24:05] like but what a queen ex gets for being
[1:24:09] right right you understand what I'm
[1:24:11] saying what a queen gets for being right
[1:24:15] vashi was beautiful she was the wife but
[1:24:19] she done something
[1:24:21] wrong and God Cut Her Off God finished
[1:24:25] with those denominational churches and
[1:24:26] he said I want a bride that's true to me
[1:24:29] now there's not a time there's not a
[1:24:32] time that you see where Esther is not
[1:24:35] going have I found favor have I found
[1:24:38] favor in your sight do you hear that and
[1:24:40] she keeps reminding him have I not done
[1:24:42] these things have I not kept my word
[1:24:44] have I not kept your word and that's
[1:24:47] what God's waiting on you and I to do to
[1:24:49] where we can boldly walk up and he stick
[1:24:50] that Seer out and you walk up and talk
[1:24:52] to God face to face and you know what
[1:24:55] solve your problems cuz she had a
[1:24:58] problem she had a big problem she had a
[1:25:00] problem bigger than what most of our
[1:25:01] problems are she had a problem of her
[1:25:03] own kin folks being wiped out of her own
[1:25:06] family being wiped out and she made a
[1:25:08] petition she said if I perish I perish
[1:25:12] so she went in there with death on her
[1:25:14] mind you and I are walking into that
[1:25:18] part but I say today if I perish I
[1:25:20] perish but I'm walking into that line
[1:25:23] I'm walking into that place to where God
[1:25:25] can talk to me and I can talk to God and
[1:25:27] we can have a conversation and I can
[1:25:29] remind him of his promises and remind
[1:25:32] him that there was an Esther that saved
[1:25:34] the whole Jewish community and how that
[1:25:36] you and I
[1:25:38] right are exact example I mean they were
[1:25:42] example of us remember I preached a
[1:25:44] sermon where we're not a type anymore
[1:25:46] we're not a type everything's typing us
[1:25:48] cuz there's nothing for us to type
[1:25:50] everything types the bride so everything
[1:25:52] around the Bible and written is a type
[1:25:54] of me and you when you talk about
[1:25:57] literally turning somebody back that
[1:25:59] means literally not figuratively not a
[1:26:02] metaphor these are metaphors these are
[1:26:04] examples these are um what' you say what
[1:26:08] these are these are things that that are
[1:26:10] examples to you and I they're
[1:26:13] Parables we're not a parable that's
[1:26:16] right what are we a parable of the Bible
[1:26:19] is a parable of us cuz this talking to
[1:26:22] me and you Robie it's not talking to
[1:26:24] somebody else and when he got to where
[1:26:26] Esther was walking in there and Buddy
[1:26:29] when she put on what she was supposed to
[1:26:31] put on and he hadn't seen her in 30 days
[1:26:34] my when I don't see June for about 3 or
[1:26:35] 4 days I get all excited when she walks
[1:26:38] in the door so what about a god though
[1:26:42] they said hey I want to have communion
[1:26:45] with you amen you put on the right
[1:26:47] clothes so whatever you ask it doesn't
[1:26:50] matter right he didn't didn't put
[1:26:52] stipulation on it when he told her said
[1:26:54] whatever you ask I'll give it to you
[1:26:56] let's bow our
[1:26:57] heads dear heavenly father we pray Lord
[1:27:00] that what's been said today has been a
[1:27:02] little enlightening to the people and
[1:27:04] that they'll take it Lord and and when
[1:27:06] they hear the word Esther they'll think
[1:27:07] of redemption and they'll think of how
[1:27:10] that a a little girl stood in the gap
[1:27:13] for a group of people Lord and as we
[1:27:15] stand down here in the gap for for
[1:27:17] sinners in the in the world Lord that
[1:27:19] the only thing that they're going to see
[1:27:21] the only they're going to see is you is
[1:27:23] you through us and now we see that you
[1:27:26] were working through Esther and you were
[1:27:28] working through Mori and you were
[1:27:30] working through all the things that were
[1:27:32] going on on this in this story but Lord
[1:27:34] let's not make it a story let's make it
[1:27:37] a reality where the ends of the world
[1:27:39] have come upon a group of people that
[1:27:42] are not examples Lord that's what Esther
[1:27:44] was talking about that's what the whole
[1:27:47] Bible was talking was pointing toward
[1:27:49] here pointing toward a little bride in
[1:27:51] the end time that would take your word
[1:27:53] and put on the Garment and do the right
[1:27:55] things and not be ashamed Esther was
[1:27:58] never ashamed to go before you Lord she
[1:28:00] was never ashamed to go before that King
[1:28:03] cuz she knew she had done things right
[1:28:05] and we pray Lord that you would take the
[1:28:08] as we say the players of the the mamans
[1:28:11] and the hag guys and the moris and all
[1:28:13] the the players and the acts of the play
[1:28:16] that you would put them around us Lord
[1:28:18] that will help us that will help us be
[1:28:21] our support group that will help us Lord
[1:28:23] to be closer to you father cuz they were
[1:28:26] the ones that that little Esther
[1:28:28] listened to and was able to get in front
[1:28:29] of the king Lord we want you to be our
[1:28:33] King we want you to be our husband we
[1:28:36] want you to be our lover we want you to
[1:28:37] be the one that you can't take your eyes
[1:28:40] off of but Lord we've got to live right
[1:28:42] and do right and act right before
[1:28:45] that'll happen I pray that that'll
[1:28:47] happen today Lord yes Lord that if
[1:28:49] anybody has anything in their heart Lord
[1:28:51] or anything about them Lord I pray
[1:28:53] myself that you'd forgive me of my sins
[1:28:55] Lord forgive me of my actions and my
[1:28:57] thoughts wrong thoughts toward others
[1:29:00] that you'll forgive me of the things
[1:29:01] that I do that are not pleasing to you
[1:29:03] so that when I need something from you
[1:29:05] Lord when I have to get up in the middle
[1:29:07] of the night and make a petition for
[1:29:09] someone else Lord that there won't be
[1:29:11] anything in the way that I'll have on
[1:29:13] the right garment that we all as a
[1:29:15] congregation will have on the right
[1:29:16] garment that we'll know what to to do
[1:29:19] when we present oursel to you Lord when
[1:29:21] we present our
[1:29:22] for our children our family our husband
[1:29:24] our wife our sickness our the things
[1:29:27] that we need Lord we we need to get

[1:29:30] can come boldly to the throne of grace
[1:29:33] where we can come to you father and know
[1:29:34] that you'll give us that petition not
[1:29:37] just not just hoping but that knowing
[1:29:40] Lord that we've done the right thing on
[1:29:41] our side and that you definitely always
