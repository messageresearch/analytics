TRANSCRIPT
========================================
you've killed back into 14 1,300 1,200 somewhere and and they were all gathered into a that's where you get to work ghetto from right the word ghetto come from them ghetto means a gathering of undesirable people or something like to happening so they would round up all the Jews put them in a ghetto and and they would either turn the women to prostitution the men that would turn them into thieves and it was pretty horrible what they didn't do all right let's go Romans 12:1 talk about that in this afternoon I beseech you brethren ye therefore brethren oh why don't you bring your daughter you simply I mean eww you bring your mom away you brought your mama's favorite daughter good to have y'all with I beseech you therefore brethren oh this is Paul in Romans we're in verse in chapter 12 I beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of God to present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and that means rational it's a reasonable service right and be not conformed to this world because that's what we were when we were born here we were conformed to the world come it was done by a Bible study last night you know you don't you you in nature he give you memories and concentration imagination that's what you give that to you because they can give it to you but Satan comes in and perverts all that and then that nature attaches to your soul and if it stays that way and you make a wrong make decision after the age of accountability then that's all if that would pull on its way to Hell in black whatever we're going to call it because the spirit realm of man is say it works with where God works buddy okay even you'd be born again and you have bad dogs and do bad things okay that's why I thank God for a prophet that said you could be born again and you know be suicidal or are things like that go I hear mine he saw that I know he did remember he saw that one woman that was in them in the insane asylum but because of something that she had done back in her previous life and once all that came out she she became alright then you got rose out of the one that was a prostitute and drunk you know now she was some of my testifying in the glory of God but don't think for one minute Rosella didn't every day Satan remind her of what she did so that was in her memory that's what we were talking about during the whole point is that there's no way that your spirit realm can be totally born-again like your soul while you're still alive here you always got brother wrapped in and be sticky till the end all right so it's going to be sticky but something's going to change that you know the soul's gonna work its way out and change that but there's really you can't do anything about them even Jesus Almighty God himself he has the Holy Ghost in his spirit and he was still tempted brother best attempt among women same even coming Tim did father say to walk up to Almighty God and say hey you of you say you are do this do this do this then so on so don't be conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God because you will prove who you are we're continually doing that so why is the perfect will of God his will is his word it will is his word all the ways that when I look at that Bible I see that as just like you go and have a big family and we all go to a to an estate attorney and that attorney section he opens up the wheel and what does that will do that will tells you what you got because somebody had to die the testator had to die so you know without Jesus Christ dying the Bible's worthless anyway then you wouldn't be just a good prophet and just walked among men but since he died he brought the Old Testament the life and the New Testament Wow that's why Jesus Christ the will of God and you say well who's the executor of the will the Holy Ghost eat what is the executor doing the executor make sure that the will is carried out so when you get to baptism the Holy Ghost you get the executor of the will inside of you which is the Holy Ghost which is the one that says it tells you what's it what the will says all right and then you do then then it performs that for I say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think in other words you know don't put yourself above but think soberly let's look at that word right there because that word does not mean not a drunk all right all right it means let's do the school bell here you know over into onto to towards or among to in other words think sanely think according to the will of God all right because we remember a drunk person if you do use that allegory a drunk person doesn't think right there's a lot of things that they wouldn't do it they were in their sober mind so thanks same way with with with the world and truly the world's bunch of drunks now I'm not talking about liquid drugs yeah they're drunk on everything else right they're not sober you and I are the only sober people in the whole world that we have come to a place that God has give us something internally because the world thinks its externally you see these women on TV shows and stuff did that work 40 years ago and they think they're still that 40 year girl you know oh they look horrible sad well that's what they're doing they're living and I want progressive living in a rear view mirror yes and you and I should never live in a rear view mirror because what happened when you look in the rear view mirror and you drive it you have wrecked yeah reg so we don't want have a wreck we want to think soberly Cortney has gone as Delta every man the measure you see that which is measure every person has a measure of faith that's why we've been talking about laying on of hands or just speaking the word there's a measure of faith some are weak in faith some are strong in faith some are right in the middle but not everybody has the same measure because God had dealt to every man the measure of faith for as we have many members in one body and all the members have not the same office in other words everybody's not the finger are you body would just look like a banger no you've got all your different parts but not the same office or the same function see that word means function so you got this they don't have the same function if if your whole body was a with a heart you know you couldn't function you need all the other organs for everything to function together so we being many the body of Christ being men are one body in Christ when you go back to the scripture says not seeds as of many but one seed which is Christ because when we get into that future home and it's nothing but the bride excuse me in the 144,000 in that new city that is one body now you exclude 144,000 they're not a part of the body they're servants to the body but that one body of every how many millions of born-again people that live in that city they're one body all right now many members but one body same way now I mean you know a little millennium I'll be in the future but I'm saying now we're scattered among the heathen yes you know so but then man it's gonna be all brought into one place and it's gonna be a wonderful time so being many are one body in Christ and everyone everyone members of another can't do it without we gotta help each other having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us now we'll talk about that in just a minute whether prophecy let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith because not everybody's not everybody's prophecy gift of prophecy everybody has look gifts differing according to the grace that is given us now brother Brown said that we could you know he called it laying under the water spout long enough you can speak in tongues and others you can force yourself into it but there are some people that can speak in tongues they have the gift of speaking in tongues they don't have to work yourself into the gift but not everybody you got nine you got wisdom you have faith you got this you got that you got the nine spiritual gifts that's nine of them that work in the body and like always said we major on a minor the bottom two is tongues and prophecy are tongues and interpretations that's the bottom answer that's the least of all those what about the other seven okay the other seven gifts let's work down through the other seven gifts and once we work down through the other seven gifts you get down to tongues and interpretation because Satan can interpret a lot of those yes okay one thing he can't interpret though and that's the will of God he cannot interpret that word now he can misinterpret yes but he can't interpret it word for word he makes it come out right he's always gonna make it come out wrong somewhere all right so have anything gets different according to the grace that is given to us whether prophecy let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith our ministry let us wait on our ministry you've heard of a old many of many of us you know you you see these people that come out gung-ho and they come right out of the world we'll even brother Brown says come come out of the barroom on Saturday night and preach on sin any morning that might work one another ten million but uh but a ministry has to develop now you're born with the gift but that gift has to develop because you can use it wrong we see a lot of people using things wrong you know because you have to be careful with money women in popularity now you watch all three of them somewhere a ministry is going to have a problem with one of those three and if you're not solid behind the stay behind the Word of God one of them will get you okay even being a born-again Christian one of them will hurt you yeah I'm telling you it will happen it'll happen mining women in popularity because it says here you own don't be popular because you come up here to the top it says we're not I I always make this statement about you know patting yourself on the back that's okay but I was somewhere the other day and a preacher friend of mine told me that another preacher he sold does that from the pulpit he passes on back Pope in a back seat is using it a little bit cuz I use it as if ain't nobody gonna fetch in the bag you might want pat yourself on the back now I'm talking about you know doing stuff out here I ain't talking about standing in the pulpit oh you know thanks yeah yeah I've heard that before 10 so be careful because you got money women in popularity popularity is one that really hurts you ministry let us wait on our ministering or he that teacheth on teaching so wait let God develop the gift because you can have a gift of prophecy probably picked it be prophecy and be wrong you can promise our wrong Balaam was wrong but he was a prophet he could sigh right we're brother Brown said the guy was that he meant was speaking in tongues and yellow and interpreting one speaking in tongues he discerned to be a Christian the other one of the interpreting we living with another with another woman yeah alright so that's why I did all those non spiritual gifts those two at the bottom of the one that's gonna that everybody loves you know they write the way I said is they write then that spiritual gift they write selling them so little you can't see them didn't in last two of the tones and interpretation they write and grab big fun you know worth tongues and interpretations well that's the two of the least gifts and that's the one that can get you in the most trouble we saw him brother rounds ministry to God you know remember that woman that was going to get up and thinking towns and all that she was getting ready and she well now that's kind of like pat yourself on the back you know that's brother brother brother Ram discerned that spirit and called it out well then then what happened when he got finished with the sermon all those spiritual people that believed in the two likes gifts more than any of the other come up to brother Brown to you you equates to spirit or whatever he's sitting you know what he went apologetic about it right he said that woman was out of line that woman was out of order so you know what gift he was using one day mother seven wisdom faith knowledge and all those with all that up here at the top instead of using them to it to bother me I've seen tones coming interpretations I've seen people speaking tongues with no interpretation but a lot of times brother Brown said you speak in tongues you do it free stuff you know you're speaking to the Lord for yourself I another house I'd rather have somebody would you get the wisdom and with the gift of faith and all those others we may go through those spiritual gifts sometimes don't have that and have all the other okay discerning of spirits II see it if that guy down here that was interpretation appealing even if the guy speaking in tongues then people have congregation thought that guy was up you know so they didn't have that gift of discerning of spirits if they ever have that gift that brother Branham had you say Willie had come to the prophet I don't always happen you know God can tell you a lot of things and you're not being the Prophet but if you use that gift instead of the other ones thanks I've told that gossip hey you need to get your life straight for your stress going all this so I don't believe in gifts I believe all nine but they should all not operate according to the Word of God they should operate according to and you know what I believe they do I believe they dead well deserting your spirit yeah that's the last thing but you got all those others that we don't use we just get brown them down to the bottom too you know mmm but you know that's just the way we are watch the way you've been tall I'm brother Graham said that's the way y'all been talking y'all been talking to just jump up and start speaking in tongues and he said but if you'll do it in over a corner in the Bible one he was a prophet he was Elijah he was restoring the order of the church he said if you'll do it this way it'll work properly and I believe it did from brother Branham was that because you know you had brother Neville brother Neville was not only a minister he had a gift of prophecy or prophecy but you don't hear him when brother Browns preaching you don't hear him stand up and start giving a prophecy you never hear him to end up been given Ralphie why because I believe you had it in order and he had brothers around there too teaching you know that's what he said he said we start teaching these babies and then you'll come to a place and he even told the Brown Tabernacle y'all stand up speaking tongues you hearing preaching now thanks a lot time Tina pay attention to some times now at the very end of a service and being a prophet you watch on those tapes he pauses just for a few seconds then you hear he sees that thing fall he sees that light of that spirit come down following that person because you said let's just wait a thing or let's just wait a minute you'll pop but him up preaching you hear some sister jump up he never even acknowledges that they're speaking they don't why they're out of order in other words they're out of order so in other words you got to move that out of the way and they keep on doing what you do in ministry or he that exhorteth on exhortation let's see what that word means that means to call them near and vote to call them one side call for to address or to speak to all right so let him that exhorteth only exhortation in other words speak to a person and give them them you know give a little boost you know that's the way we do in ministry you know you said with your bride this is what you're your bride and god this is what God s exhortation you're telling the person your bride if you're right what are they doing they going back to the will and telling you what you got okay cuz I'm telling you to be the bride of Jesus Christ is the greatest thing on the face of the earth there's nothing I said on the earth there's no greater than being the bride of Jesus Christ but now that we're telling you what God said I'm not telling you that you're the greatest cuz I said you're the greatest I'm just reading the well the Holy Ghost is telling you the executor of the whale is telling you what the world says about what about you because you under this number I love being the bride right so we do exhort well he did give it let him do it with simplicity he that ruleth with diligence he that show us mercy with cheerfulness and see how you can and you know what as I read that several individuals come to my mind so see they've used that gift in my life to help me so you should read the same thing and look back to your life and see and and pull a name out I think a robber title now some of you didn't know brother tell him I did in my younger life all the way up but right there he that showeth mercy with children it he did it was simply a Geordie with simplicity he was a simple man and he that you know what though that part of him was right here so you got to see that part of you for whatever it is maybe not that one okay I have to learn to be an exhortation that's because it's not up I'm gonna be I'm gonna be the one to cut you know and see this is that this is a sticky one here rule it would diligent I snag one time I said how do you put up with some of them people in that church and it's been 20 years ago not now cuz I seen that wife was over but back then I did he said give them time most patient mail and faces the art that man got facing law well what that diligence is patience yeah the only justice pay you just either standing right and you let the people do what they do and then that's right you ruined diligence let's see what okay earnest miss that's what all that with hate earnestness I like that about their earnestness earnestness in accomplishing promoting or striving after anything interest oneself most earnestly in other words he has diligence with us our patience with us he earnestly contend for the faith that once delivered to this name so he earnestly contend with a life all right he did show us mercy with cheerfulness let love be without dissimulation let's do you want that word fast just to make sure hypocrisy love without being a hypocrite all right so you love without dissimulation I pour that which is evil cleave to that which is good in other words hang on to what is good clinging to what that which is good become the affectioned one to another with brotherly love that's coming right here just on your perfect man remember that's the last one before the capstone so that must be the roughest one real there all right here we we get up here that's that's okay that's okay that's okay that's okay patience is pretty right darlings brother kindness is right there at the headstone right in honour preferring one another brother man I'm always television and many men you've met that have been real successful in business and stuff now there are the arrogant ones but you see the ones that are there they're just good people they actually ask you how you're doing ask you how your family is ask you how you're terrible things going with you instead I mean me I did this I did that in case I'm weighing and it's it's beautiful to listen like daddy always says it's beautiful to listen to your texture month you know listening what God has done for you not slothful in business and that's in any business that's building Christian business fervent in spirit serving the Lord rejoicing in Hope patient in tribulation in other words that patient when everything's going haywire persevering I read you the scripture the other day that in Matthew where brother Claude really enjoys that night I'm beginning to like it myself those who endure to the end shall be saved those who endure to the end shall be saved because there's a lot of people in this way that's going to fall off there's a lot of people but if you endure to the end I want to use a Dave Ramsey quote because they Randy says you're getting rid of your dead it's not a microwave it's a crock-pot so the same thing in Christianity Christianity is not a microwave you see these people that come in like a microwave they go out like one right but they come in like a crop block you know what a crock pot does for those who don't know what a crock one does me man slow cooker you put it on in your way all day but boy at the end is the best roast and potatoes mama fix them Jim roasted lot of character like heirs but that's what it is in Christianity it's not a it's not a microwave it's a crock pot mentality you gotta endure to me and you got to step there and you know why you may be hungry but it may take 12 hours for that to cook the boy at the end it's good stuff rejoice in Hope patient in tribulation continuing instant in prayer that's from you interpreted that pray without ceasing all right and and and you know what you do that unconsciously as a Christian you do that unconsciously you don't say no we do have our prayer time now I don't have I'm just gonna be honest I don't have a prayer time where I go in and I pray for 30 minutes no I pray for a little while then I'll sit down on my tablet and I'll read I've been went back to Ezekiel now I'm going back to Jeff to me that's my prayer time but then you know what just like that right there that I saw I can see people in the Bible not not Caroline and these on y'all and us people that have influenced me and done bad things are good things you can read the Bible same minutes that's just like songsong see to me that puts the Bible real for me still like data you know like daddy's been saying you know it's not - it's not that letter that Bible that you're looking at is the written official known and read of all men so if somebody's like that somebody in your life you've read their life and like I said it's not a sum of it's a short story and some of us were warned peace version you know it's a little short some of it takes a long time but still continuing instant in prayer cleaving drama down the road I hate this is my one of my pet peeve I hate to see people broke down on side of the road that may not bother you one bit but I just can't inside me something works and I don't stop all the time I don't stop probably maybe one out of 500 but when I pass on the Lord just send somebody clap couldn't help they ain't got jumper cable I couldn't I don't know what a key is and I don't where to stick it in the car that's about it thank God for mechanics you know right man all right can I just probably measure this stuff that's my stuff but I always crash you lord send them a wrecker or send them somebody that knows we don't ride but everybody I don't think I've ever missed anybody might have but even going down a road and I'd be sitting there driving and talking y'all are thinking about something else so that distract you everybody see that if I didn't want to tell you almost matching know why not my my most massive spider that's what mama saying oh you know what it makes by the way of the mellimelon hate spiral it anyway was that your cousin yeah so break like a million fleas in your house wrong voices wrong okay he takes it outside let's get back to what we're doing here continuing instantly in prayer so that's what I mean about a few driving down a road even if somebody comes do you mind what do you do you should Lord bless that person Lord be with that person if someone comes to you about what is continuing in prayer because I'll promise you the truck driver this own camel 19 on the CB is it 9 19 whatever they made their cuts they're talking about their girlfriends about what they're gonna do to their you know you're still I'm say they ain't continually in prayer but you as a Christian you're aware of your surroundings and you're continually in prayer some of you were praying I didn't kill that spot early work flies my daddy kills millions of flies and he wastes all of them were dead so a little firing that hurt me but he's dead oh well I'm not worried about that either rejoicing in Hope patient in tribulation continuing instant in prayer well let me give you a point on that brother Brown the angel said everything you love they'll be there I don't love my daddy don't love what so they may be there for somebody else you may see them in look like somebody looks like PPM with the Flies going around you know going around the head but not my brother Dale walks up giggles he flies know where the last knot his desire he didn't lot of them cuz brother brown horse was there because he loved their brother grounds dog was there now that's fine that's fine but now all this other nonsense is just nonsense everybody up killed not gonna be there that's just nonsense that's not having a lot of wisdom dish distributing to the necessity of saints now that's us that's us in our fight that's us in our environment that loves y'all okay wait you know what that's okay patient in distributing to the necessity of saints given the hospitality and now Jim loves to be hospitable a love but we're not gonna be hospitable bless their with persecute you unless debate yeah that's what you mean all the time the others came out with one or sixty thousand of them in a box you just can't help watching the baby but I don't think that bees don't buzz up me at the future home and don't you tell me why no everything will be in harmony over there don't worry I'm not gonna worry about you just worry about getting yeah you know what go create your own world and go live with all the bugs but I'm not I mean short visit but not real and if you got flies there brother down never see you again and they're gonna be the same I mean I've never if you ever seen Bella don't change the fly it's like I mean he's on a mission yeah mama knows and he's only he's got to I'm telling this someone finally he's got to and he's going hurt train you feel that and we'll talk to Moses about cream well I think the flies were already there even just a little meal at Moses for making Selenia yeah creative block for a creative life which I am it so everything's gonna set it something assess to do that we have you know you've done you've got germs on you they're good jerks that you need you read about that sometime never grossed you out how many boats you got already on you yeah they need your Flash you need to this when he takes care of that and now ya think but that's not being in harmony with nature alright listen but let's talk about humans because listen we have a soul God created us to worship Him now in us being listened and us being the worship part we are all the creation behind us worship the god thing so we are connected to them to nature to the creation but as because we fell they fell so you see the dead animals and stuff laying on side of the road and all that stuff and you know what I I hate that I don't I don't like yeah I had a friend of mine one time he'd run off the road hit squirrel that's just being mad I've just been made her about I know I tried my best to swerve and miss him now I'm not gonna run off the road and kill myself and who's riding with me but I'm gonna try to avoid it at all cost so that's the difference my brother Graham said he goes nut and he killed thousands of animals but he couldn't stand him guys who just want to print slaughter okay so there's a difference you know what it is the only difference is it's the psyche or that mentality of that person what's in that person okay bless them are giving the hospitality and we should we should be the most hospitable people on the face of this earth we should be the most accommodating people on the face of the earth all right bless them which persecute you do you bless them Lord for running out in front of me and cutting me off no that's usually not won't be there because what would Jesus say said it's really easy in other words it's easy to bless somebody that blesses you he said it's real hard to bless the people that curse you yes and to me that's what brotherly kindness is because you could if you couldn't tell who brother Browns friends or foe were he was blessing the ones that persecuted him and him being a prophet knew they persecute knew they didn't like him right through the discernment he knew spiritually they didn't like him but he did not let that bother him now humanely I bet it did cuz remember he says I'm a neurotic and I have to go get along well you know why he had a complex but he overcame those things because he had a job one job today we all need to find out our job what our job is unless all good yes bless them which persecute you bless and curse not rejoice with them that do rejoice and weep with them that weep in other words brotherly kindness being together be of the same mind one toward another minds not high things see what that means do not set your mind on high things but condescend to men of low estate that's what it's talking about somebody's that's a really successful person they have a young if they're really a Christian and a successful person they when they walk into a room it's not like I'm 6 feet taller than everybody else you know I'm gonna postpone my walk around no be not wise in your own conceits in your own estimation ok don't think yourself better and you know what it's hard today let's be honest it's hard to do that it's hard to see somebody that's doing wrong or doing you wrong and knowing that they're not born again and you're standing here a child to God morning in heavy turtle life in your soul you're a liar look at me in the face you're a liar if you sometimes don't think that personal just not as good as me hello it just seemed a little a little small even even if it happens in your humanity just for a second because I do the same thing but you know what you do you cast down that imagination and you say God if they had to bend for you saving me that's the only difference between me and prosecutors I'm saying that she's not that's the only difference not that I'm up here and she's down here no recompense no man evil for evil now you see how the Bible says now look in the Old Testament it was eye for an eye tooth for tooth arm for an arm life for a life comes remember for man kills you brother you don't kill you kill him that's why they made defense cities where those people could run into the city and not be killed until they were tried but if you were called outside the city you can kill them and be justified under the law but the law says thou shall not kill but the law says you can kill that person if he kills your brother all right so you see you have to you come up here and yo do not wreck the pants recompense evil for evil now how many times have we said not now but in our in our old life that I'm going to get back at that person for whatever you want to say all right anything family member friend whatever you know they they wrong even they so I'll get back at that person cuz that's whole world that's what this world mate is both of I'm gonna get back at that person because you did this to me I'm gonna do this to you you don't do that when you're Christian you try that's why you don't take your brother to court you don't take your brother to Allah he's your brother you're supposed to work those things actually if you have a partner business partner or anything it's church member it needs to be settled in a church that's what we got all the way from that now they said no I'll just hire a lawyer to them you know so you pants off no no you need to handle that right hand I read that long you know several months ago when we were in the statute person then we talked about taking the brother the car the Bible says don't take a brother the court take him before the elders of the church and judge the situation because the Bible says Paul says how can you not judge this if you're going to judge angels in judge the whole world if you can't judge among yourself right so that's why we but the easiest way to see the easiest way to go I'll hire a lawyer let him handle it because it's kind of not face to face you come in here it's the pastor in a couple of Deacons and the two guys or two girls whatever and you're face to face but now we're not supposed to do that let me read this and we'll go provide things honest in the sight of all men if it be possible look at Paul he's not making this the cutting Drive thing if it be possible as much as lieth in you live peaceably with all men we can't always do that because they won't let you all right they won't which is not to you that but as long as you say it for them then that's their problem not your projects go ahead all right let me get on here kind of a life lesson today thank you group all
