[0:01] hello thank you wonderful hope everybody
[0:03] had a good week wonderful
[0:07] okay Lisa me and Lisa had a good week
[0:10] cuz we got to pick on T for a couple of
[0:13] [Music]
[0:16] days we got to pick on little brother
[0:18] for a little while at least just
[0:21] gigg all
[0:25] right the elevation I should have took
[0:29] some
[0:31] the elevation it's about
[0:37] 5000t said spray your nose when you have
[0:40] ear in spray your nose with blow and
[0:45] that go
[0:49] [Applause]
[0:51] down all right we are in our study on
[0:56] the first seal all right so now I think
[0:59] we're uh
[1:02] I mean I want to kind of go a little
[1:05] bit we're going to go a little bit slow
[1:07] but I want you to get this out of
[1:09] scripture first so let's go you don't
[1:12] have to go I'll just take us right to it
[1:15] we kind of ended up on 2
[1:18] Thessalonians that's where brother R
[1:20] read the scripture second Thessalonians
[1:23] 2 I got it right here so y' he said how
[1:25] convenient you can read this better you
[1:27] read what's on you I can so all right so
[1:30] now he's Paul is writing to the
[1:36] Thessalonians and brother Brown picked
[1:38] this scripture in the first seal so
[1:42] we're going to read this one we're going
[1:43] to read Matthew CU that's where brother
[1:45] Brown went to Matthew
[1:46] 24 now what we were talking about last
[1:49] Sunday everybody remember that we were
[1:50] talking about a mirror all right Mirror
[1:53] Image now with god he's a Creator right
[1:57] so we are created in His image
[2:00] IM we are created in His image we are
[2:04] not we don't look like God we are God in
[2:08] another form so there's a big difference
[2:10] there cuz Satan as we're going to see
[2:13] here Satan is a mirror image of
[2:17] God but he's just an image like like Bob
[2:21] you know you can see Bob in that image
[2:23] right there well well that's the real
[2:24] person but that in there is is it can be
[2:28] distorted let me have you been to a a
[2:31] festival and I know one thing for sure
[2:33] you don't go into one that makes you
[2:34] look big you go into one that makes you
[2:36] look skinny you know you walk into them
[2:37] places and it's all dist well that's a
[2:39] mirror and that's what a mirror does a
[2:42] mirror shows what's in front of it but
[2:44] it doesn't have to always in other words
[2:47] it can lie to you how many times you
[2:49] look in the mirror and go man I look
[2:51] good many
[2:54] lies but you understand what I'm saying
[2:56] so that's why that and I was thinking
[2:59] about this morning and still again it
[3:01] keeps bearing on my heart that that
[3:02] brother R freaks the seal open the seal
[3:05] but yet we've not taken body chain so
[3:08] there's a revelation somewhere that
[3:09] we're not getting that one day it's got
[3:12] to
[3:13] click it's got to click that's right to
[3:18] each one of us individually it's got to
[3:20] click or we're just going to go by the
[3:22] grave we're just going to keep dying
[3:24] that's right right that's right
[3:27] so then it's got to be a person
[3:30] Revelation yes through God I mean from
[3:33] God through a prophet into your soul and
[3:37] then what words you bring in that has to
[3:39] mesh together and that's not a mirror
[3:42] that is actually God himself in another
[3:45] form right residing inside of
[3:48] you right that's why the world wants to
[3:51] that's why I think about you know this
[3:53] week hadn't had a lot of time to study
[3:55] but I just think you know think about
[3:57] things but um the world they always want
[4:00] to mirror somebody else you know this
[4:03] guy comes out with this certain hair do
[4:05] you see millions of people come out with
[4:06] this certain hair do you see this girl
[4:08] come out with a certain dress or
[4:10] undressed and the world come what they
[4:13] want to be the mirror image of that
[4:15] person there's some people have actually
[4:18] had plastic surgery to make them look
[4:19] like their most famous
[4:21] star see you and I don't have to go
[4:24] that's man you know what that is that's
[4:25] Satan perverting what God wants you to
[4:28] do he wants you to change your image but
[4:30] he don't want to change your physical
[4:32] image he likes you just the way you are
[4:35] he wants to change your spiritual
[4:37] image amen if you're born again today
[4:41] you have the spiritual image of Jesus
[4:43] Christ and not just a mirror image it's
[4:47] actually him inside there working his
[4:48] way out okay so what has Satan done he
[4:52] always perverts he never he never is an
[4:55] originator he's never
[4:58] original remember that he never is
[5:02] original he was created
[5:06] secondar so if you see Satan do
[5:08] something God's already put it out there
[5:10] Amen brother Bram comes on the scene and
[5:13] then you get all the Impostors coming
[5:14] well now why didn't imposters come first
[5:17] they didn't have anything to imposter
[5:19] after right in other words brother
[5:22] random walks up to the mirror of Divine
[5:25] Healing just say all right there's an
[5:28] image of brother brand in that in that
[5:30] mirror so they don't all they don't all
[5:33] now some of them were true but some of
[5:35] them he said were false what some of
[5:37] them do just take that image and they
[5:39] say we're going to imitate that's like
[5:42] um Simon in the
[5:44] Bible he saw all them and the Seven Sons
[5:47] of scha they wanted to imitate what they
[5:50] saw without having what they saw inside
[5:54] of them
[5:55] first everybody got that cuz you know
[5:57] Simon's like man I if I could use this
[6:00] and he might had pretty good intentions
[6:01] he said but in in other words Peter said
[6:04] God knows your heart inside your heart
[6:06] you're want to make money off of this or
[6:08] you want to do something and he said get
[6:10] away from us right May said I'll even
[6:12] buy it well see when you start doing
[6:14] that you know that it's false you can't
[6:18] buy salvation it's the freest thing in
[6:20] the world you know people don't want it
[6:23] but you see the people in the Bible that
[6:24] had it though Paul we know Jesus we
[6:27] know the devil seven sons of Kea that
[6:31] what the seven sons got caught up into
[6:34] into something they saw Paul and Peter
[6:37] and them doing Mighty
[6:39] Miracles and they just jump in presuming
[6:44] presumptuously and say we're going to
[6:46] mirror what they
[6:47] did right didn't work did it cuz it was
[6:52] a mirror image right it wasn't the exact
[6:55] image it wasn't the person you we got
[6:58] that's why brother I believe he
[7:00] introduced the person of Jesus Christ
[7:03] more clear than anyone in the since
[7:05] Jesus himself right so if he introduced
[7:08] that person he didn't introduce an image
[7:10] and a
[7:12] mirror he introduced the person of Jesus
[7:15] Christ now an image is not a person an
[7:17] image is an image like I said you could
[7:19] you can mask your image you can do all
[7:21] these things but what's inside of you is
[7:23] what's going to
[7:25] tell so what Satan has done though is
[7:28] when God rides out
[7:30] out God is God is his he he has his own
[7:34] power right he permiss remember we were
[7:38] reading it last Sunday power was given
[7:41] power was given power was
[7:44] given he has to give Satan you know who
[7:46] give Satan the power it's like Brother
[7:47] Gary Atkins used to say you got the man
[7:50] with a bow in Revelation 61 he's
[7:55] harmless he can't shoot you without
[7:58] arrows but we get into situations all
[8:01] the time where we hand him a dozen
[8:02] Arrows with the sharpest tips on them
[8:05] and say here now don't Sho me with it
[8:09] but no we hand him the we hand him the
[8:11] power what brother Brown say when when
[8:14] we come to this certain place that Satan
[8:15] will be powerless Satan's going to be
[8:18] powerless in the Millennium but he's
[8:19] still going to be here
[8:21] yes right he's not going to be walking
[8:24] around he's going to be messing with
[8:25] your head but he's going to be somewhere
[8:27] holding because he has no one to work
[8:30] through that's right and then maybe at
[8:31] the end of the Millennium we see that
[8:33] how he works his way back and tries to
[8:35] get enough people to you know to u to
[8:39] come against God but that's a whole
[8:41] another subject don't start thinking
[8:42] about that but that is what he does he's
[8:44] an imitator remember one thing he is a
[8:46] bluff he's an imitator he has to be
[8:48] given power and when you see a white
[8:51] horse ride out like brother Brown said
[8:53] here stands the Lamb with the book of
[8:54] hand there goes the White Horse writer
[8:55] he said when you got two when you got
[8:57] two subjects
[9:00] one of them is God and one of them has
[9:02] to be the devil not the second person of
[9:04] a
[9:05] trinity
[9:07] okay so now let's read second thoni
[9:11] Thessalonians so
[9:13] remember what he's going to tell you
[9:15] right
[9:17] here word of God's Eternal right so he's
[9:20] not talking to the Thessalonians this
[9:21] morning he's talking to the Lula lonians
[9:26] this morning now we beseech ye Brethren
[9:28] by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ
[9:30] and by our gathering together unto him
[9:32] that you be not shaken in mind because
[9:35] we see that happening now people are
[9:36] being shaken by the by different
[9:38] doctrines and
[9:40] ideas right all over the message and
[9:42] then some are turning and leaving right
[9:46] okay and if they left guess what if they
[9:49] leave this message and turn it down then
[9:51] they do not have the Holy Ghost so they
[9:53] are
[9:54] reprobate minded people not saying they
[9:58] can't come back
[10:01] yeah yo yeah
[10:06] look yes they can I mean there's only
[10:08] one thing and that's blaspheme the Holy
[10:10] Ghost right okay you said well turn into
[10:13] work well you turned it
[10:15] down so did you blashe no you a blasing
[10:18] now when they go out and go to a certain
[10:19] point and say you know and start saying
[10:22] things about it yes that is blaspheming
[10:25] but there's only one sin that's what I
[10:27] told y'all we we send people to hell
[10:29] that's going to be in heaven right
[10:31] that's right and God's going to send
[10:32] people to Heaven that's going to be I
[10:34] mean going to send people to hell that
[10:35] we think is going to be in heaven that's
[10:36] right so we got to get out of all this I
[10:39] like what brother roel and some of them
[10:40] were were saying you know
[10:43] it we and I used to do it I used to
[10:46] judge just like that well they're
[10:48] reprobate they're going to hell right
[10:51] there's only one thing you can be
[10:52] married 150,000 times and you can be a
[10:54] axe
[10:56] murderer you want me to read you in the
[10:58] Bible
[10:59] [Music]
[11:01] murderers fornicators adulterers Paul
[11:05] said such were some of you but you are
[11:07] Justified you are washed listen Blas
[11:10] beem in the Holy Ghost is the only thing
[11:13] that'll keep you out of Heaven that's
[11:15] right besides you know you're what you
[11:17] do everybody understand that yes so I'm
[11:20] not picking and choosing I'm not like
[11:22] the U I'm not like the old saying you
[11:25] know you see the the shirt that says
[11:27] kill them all let God sort them out you
[11:28] know
[11:29] no that's what we used to do we used to
[11:32] just kill them all and then well God you
[11:33] put them no leave them alone leave them
[11:37] alone there is a way for people to get
[11:39] back amen if a man in the scripture can
[11:43] marry his mother his
[11:48] stepmother we think that'd be pretty
[11:50] rough around
[11:52] here but he got forgiven he he was
[11:55] actually very sorrowful and forgetful
[11:57] had to be because Paul says he's back in
[12:00] the church now so you know I I quit
[12:03] doing that you noticed me I I don't I'm
[12:06] not I don't condemn people let them
[12:08] condemn their
[12:10] themselves sure you have to talk about
[12:12] things and P stuff but to warn people
[12:15] but
[12:16] you who am I to picking
[12:19] you now what's going to happen though
[12:21] when we go to the other side let me get
[12:23] back into that little bit when we go to
[12:24] the other side and judge then we do the
[12:27] judging but who is it is it really us
[12:30] judging is it really us judging no it's
[12:35] the word of God that's already been
[12:37] preach and God's going to say because
[12:40] you didn't follow like Sister Lisa
[12:43] followed then that is the your
[12:45] condemnation you didn't do what I said
[12:48] what you didn't do what she said you
[12:49] didn't do what I
[12:51] said okay so let let's not be so quick
[12:54] to judge people all right let them judge
[12:57] yourself I'll guarantee you one thing
[12:59] this time from now to the Rapture you're
[13:02] going to show who you are cuz that's
[13:04] what these seals are when that seal
[13:06] broke to that prophet he saw a white
[13:09] righteous Church the first church Age
[13:12] first three
[13:13] ages that had no that had no
[13:16] denomination had no impurity now
[13:20] Grievous wolves have started coming in
[13:22] but the first three ages they didn't
[13:23] have to fight over a trinitarian
[13:25] Doctrine they didn't have to fight over
[13:26] water baptism that was a pure church
[13:28] right but what rode out was was Satan
[13:31] riding out to conquer and conquer the
[13:35] ones that he was supposed to amen right
[13:39] right cuz you got to remember one thing
[13:42] the Bible says those who he has
[13:45] Justified yeah see I weigh heavy on that
[13:47] because you you got to be careful you
[13:50] can ask God to forgive you and it be a
[13:53] justification but it not be that kind of
[13:57] justification go God's just to forgive
[13:59] your
[14:01] sins even in this church over here God's
[14:03] just to forgive their sins if you truly
[14:06] ask God to forgive you he will but now
[14:08] what you continue on doing after
[14:10] that that's what God's going to
[14:13] judge right right but now that's not
[14:16] what this justification is talking about
[14:18] and this what we're getting into the
[14:19] seal is a higher form of when those who
[14:22] he has Justified he's already glorified
[14:24] you say well I'm just Justified yeah but
[14:26] God
[14:27] knows that if that is true justification
[14:31] pure justification in your heart you
[14:33] want to be a different person God's got
[14:37] to forgive you of your past cuz he said
[14:39] he
[14:40] would then you continue on in
[14:42] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[14:44] then you go into a glorified condition
[14:46] but that that see that's what I'm saying
[14:48] your scripture has got meaning to it but
[14:51] remember there's a supernatural element
[14:53] even in
[14:56] scripture like serpent say brother
[14:58] serpent seed was revealed in the seal
[15:01] now he preached serpent seed in
[15:03] 1959 4 years before the seals
[15:06] open but what did he do it made more it
[15:08] made more clear what he was preaching he
[15:11] could look back and see and not that the
[15:14] original sin was sex with the
[15:17] Beast it was Satan entering into Eve's
[15:20] brain first and she accepted what he
[15:23] said and then you come down and watch he
[15:24] seals and you see both of them and you
[15:26] see this going and that's what happened
[15:28] in the in the U uh in Genesis and we'll
[15:31] read it and we'll show you where the the
[15:33] seals are in
[15:34] Genesis right right there in Genesis 1 2
[15:37] and 3 4 5 right in there the seals
[15:39] opened right there in the book of
[15:41] gen and you can see a white righteous
[15:45] Abel
[15:47] okay the Bible says in Hebrews 11 that
[15:50] that
[15:51] Abel's blood CED out his the the blood
[15:54] of righteous Abel and then you see Cain
[15:58] and going going
[15:59] forward you see the two spirits and and
[16:03] I like what brother um Nester was saying
[16:07] to a point about how everything mingled
[16:10] back together and it did so you don't
[16:13] you can't do like some people in mess
[16:14] and go well we got a straight line from
[16:17] Adam right down to Jesus and we got a
[16:19] straight line cuz you got to remember
[16:20] that line going down to Jesus has way
[16:22] have the Harlot in it it's got Boaz I
[16:25] mean Ruth a
[16:27] moabit when you start interjecting
[16:29] that's not a Pure Line right but in
[16:31] God's eyes that's a Pure Line that's
[16:33] right okay all right same way with you
[16:35] and I but they mingled together they
[16:37] mingled their seed together so you can't
[16:38] figure out what line is
[16:41] where so you don't worry about it then
[16:43] what God God says
[16:45] okay all men needs to come to repentance
[16:48] all men needs to be judged by the law
[16:50] and then judged by Jesus Christ you see
[16:53] how God God moves up just like just like
[16:55] brother been preaching in
[16:57] stages God comes up in stages now not
[17:00] God but God to you and I he reveals
[17:03] himself in stages and there's only one I
[17:05] think about this morning you say well I
[17:08] can't understand all this and why am I
[17:10] this one you're in the age you're
[17:12] supposed to be in or you'd be in another
[17:13] age that's right okay you in the age
[17:17] you're supposed to be in or you would be
[17:19] in another age does everybody understand
[17:21] that God put you in this age because
[17:24] there's something it's not some genetic
[17:27] makeup
[17:29] humanly it's the gene seed of God knew
[17:32] you could take this pressure and you
[17:35] could take this word and apply it to
[17:37] your
[17:39] heart cuz John
[17:42] Wesley honestly Luther and Wesley this
[17:44] would blow their mind for a little while
[17:46] but now with the Holy Ghost that's right
[17:48] you can see them Wheels start turning
[17:50] that's right and then a little while
[17:51] later he'd say got it got it and they'
[17:55] move right up just like cuz the Holy
[17:56] Ghost is not limited right we limit the
[17:59] Holy Ghost right we limit him okay but
[18:03] Martin Luther's age just live by faith
[18:05] then they moved
[18:07] up right but true justification that's
[18:10] the only time in this end time this age
[18:12] we can see true justification how that
[18:14] we truly are Justified that person
[18:16] inside of you if you truly you what I'm
[18:18] saying truly Justified you're on your
[18:21] way to glorification or the Bible's
[18:22] wrong yes those who he justified that's
[18:27] right I think the Bible says right he
[18:29] has he is already he is what he done not
[18:31] what we did what he done okay so this is
[18:34] what we're talking about we're talking
[18:35] about a higher form of justification
[18:38] watching this mystery of iniquity
[18:40] watching something that maybe and and
[18:42] listen you know what iniquity is Right
[18:45] iniquity is knowing to do better and
[18:48] don't or knowing that you're doing
[18:49] something wrong and you continue to do
[18:50] it now we do that every
[18:55] day I'm looking at all of it we do that
[18:58] every single day there's things in our
[19:01] in our daily life that we go I should
[19:03] have done right right that's an
[19:08] iniquity but it's not a mystery to us
[19:12] now because later in the back in the
[19:14] ages you look how justification now what
[19:17] was the age of we're not get into this
[19:18] so we'll just talk about this the age of
[19:20] justification is what Martin Luther
[19:23] right the just shall live by faith now
[19:25] he walks into a pub drinks beer he's a
[19:27] German
[19:29] drinks beer and smokes a pipe and talks
[19:30] about God now God winked at that
[19:32] ignorance you
[19:34] say is that our
[19:36] justification to a degree yes to a
[19:38] degree
[19:38] [Applause]
[19:41] no you got it to a degree yes that's our
[19:45] beginning but that wasn't his that was
[19:47] his beginning and
[19:49] ending got it anybody understand that
[19:53] was his beginning and ending that was
[19:54] his Revelation the beginning and end of
[19:56] his Revelation was that it it doesn't
[19:58] matter what happens the just shall live
[20:01] by faith not by Penance not by pay and
[20:04] no venience not by not by crawling if
[20:07] you watch the movie I think you ought to
[20:08] watch that one where Albert fines or one
[20:10] of Robert fines plays Martin Luther yeah
[20:13] that's good he lays on rocks he's
[20:16] crawling he's trying to do some kind of
[20:19] penance but one day it's just like
[20:21] brother Dale said one day God drops down
[20:24] and says Luther it's not what you do
[20:27] right
[20:29] right you better start having faith in
[20:33] me talk about Jesus Christ and Martin
[20:36] Luther opens that scripture and reads a
[20:37] brand new
[20:38] book showing that the just shall live by
[20:42] faith now
[20:45] now parallel that with our
[20:48] justification see his justification
[20:50] carried him over sure he got the Holy
[20:52] Ghost he went through all the stages but
[20:53] it was justification he understood
[20:56] justification okay
[20:59] that was his beginning and his end right
[21:02] okay everybody okay with that because
[21:05] see you come up to here it's just our
[21:08] beginning right what does justification
[21:11] mean just mhm right just so it's just
[21:16] our beginning it's not our ending that's
[21:18] right cuz if it's our beginning it can't
[21:21] be our
[21:22] ending if it's just like
[21:25] his cuz I'm sure he went to the Grave
[21:29] let's just be honest smoking and
[21:31] drinking cuz he never came you
[21:33] understand he never came on up through
[21:35] the satification process that's right so
[21:38] that was his beginning and his end see
[21:40] now you and I our beginning is
[21:42] justification but if we continue There
[21:44] we can't die smoking a pipe and drinking
[21:46] beer that's true you understand so we
[21:49] have to I'm sorry that was that was just
[21:52] Holy Ghost Absol that's what I mean it
[21:54] was his beginning and his
[21:57] enden that's the Holy Ghost in that age
[21:59] the beginning and the end was
[22:00] justification right right but it was the
[22:03] Holy Ghost for that age that's right
[22:05] okay but now see you come to now your
[22:08] justification is your beginning that's
[22:10] what we're going to talk about right
[22:11] here we're going to talk about let no
[22:12] man deceive you that's our justification
[22:15] but it can't be our end cuz the word's
[22:17] been open more right in other words the
[22:20] devil's been exposed right the devil
[22:22] wasn't exposed in the smoking and the
[22:24] drinking back then that's right mystery
[22:27] of iniquity it is a mystery a mystery is
[22:31] something that's been hidden and now has
[22:33] been made known revealed means to make
[22:35] known all right so what happened is in
[22:37] the down Through the
[22:39] Ages it took brother Bram or a prophet
[22:42] let don't say brother Bram took the
[22:44] prophet to come and be the filter to
[22:47] where that he could tell us I don't
[22:50] think anybody in history looked back at
[22:52] Martin Luther and said Martin Luther was
[22:55] the justification of the age you
[22:58] understand what I'm saying commentaries
[22:59] sure Martin Luther is a wonderful man
[23:00] powerful man but it took a prophet to
[23:03] place him where he need to be right so
[23:06] that what you and I can look back and
[23:08] see that that justification though put
[23:11] him in the body of Christ but that
[23:12] justification in this age does not put
[23:15] you in the body of Christ so it's not
[23:17] your finish right that's right so those
[23:20] who is Justified in this age he's
[23:23] already glorified now hold on a minute
[23:25] you say that's just for us nope go back
[23:27] to
[23:28] Luther Luther's going to get a glorified
[23:31] body from that
[23:32] justification amen so those who is
[23:35] Justified he is already glorified right
[23:37] the next thing Martin Luther is going to
[23:39] get besides the resurrection is a
[23:41] glorified body off of what that
[23:43] justification they talk amen all right
[23:48] but with you and I you we got to move up
[23:51] that's why that when we come to the
[23:52] seals you see
[23:55] opposition see Martin Luther didn't see
[23:57] that as opposition I he didn't see the
[23:59] smoking and the drinking as opposition
[24:01] that's right okay right but in his
[24:06] soul he was born again in his soul God
[24:09] cleaned his soul up but his spirit and
[24:12] body had not come to a place to where
[24:13] God can move on out further and clean
[24:16] the man up he did that with the next guy
[24:19] John Wesley he moved out into
[24:22] sanctification and then Wesley I mean U
[24:25] yeah John Wesley's sanctification that
[24:28] ended his you know he went from
[24:29] sanctification to because the man he was
[24:31] stct stck stct stck okay dadd always he
[24:37] quotes it wrong it's not coffee it was
[24:39] tea you know cuz British drank tea you
[24:42] know they were tea drinkers he said tea
[24:46] it don't have no value it ain't even
[24:47] good for you in other words you know
[24:49] what he's saying you're drinking it
[24:50] because of a
[24:51] tradition Englishman English he was an
[24:54] Englishman they drank tea they don't
[24:56] drink coffee like we do they drink tea
[24:57] they have tree in the middle of the day
[24:58] they have tea in the middle of the day
[24:59] they have an evening they have an
[25:00] afternoon watch what Martin Luther was
[25:02] saying I mean John Wesley was saying you
[25:04] think that's doing you some good it's
[25:06] not doing you any good at all just don't
[25:08] drink it so see because he had to be
[25:10] different you couldn't go you can't each
[25:12] prophet of the age can't go along with
[25:14] the
[25:15] [Music]
[25:16] age right he's got to be like brother R
[25:19] said John Wesley was a f brain snatched
[25:22] out of the fire in other words he went
[25:24] through burning places up not physically
[25:27] but he burnt the soul of people so much
[25:29] to what they wanted to live a better
[25:31] life okay then you come up with the
[25:33] Pentecostal with the baptism of the Holy
[25:35] Ghost higher
[25:37] up being closer to God living holy right
[25:42] letting God use you to speak in tongues
[25:44] let God use you to heal the sick right
[25:48] then we come up to this age which is the
[25:50] word because we got to look in the
[25:53] seals where that four stages complete
[25:55] the birth in this age
[25:59] right not three four M there was four
[26:03] bugs that eat the tree down and four
[26:06] Messengers brother R said four death
[26:08] Messengers eat it four life Messengers
[26:10] brought it back what Mark I'm going just
[26:13] call their name Luther Wesley Pentecost
[26:15] and brother Brown the word the message
[26:17] that brother Brown brought from 63 to 65
[26:20] was the word of God that literally turn
[26:22] us back what brother they been preach
[26:25] there so p attention to this we and and
[26:29] listen I I was thinking about this this
[26:31] morning in the shower I
[26:33] thought you can't lean so far that way
[26:36] to sinless
[26:39] Perfection we still going to have
[26:41] problems every
[26:43] day we going to have bad thoughts that's
[26:46] right we going to make human mistakes
[26:48] that's right you know and I and and I
[26:51] want to let yall know
[26:53] this that I'm ready for the
[26:55] Rapture you know people say w we doing
[26:58] this and that what you putting it on you
[27:01] put on human condition just cuz I don't
[27:02] like your way of doing
[27:04] something wrong answer I'm ready for the
[27:07] Rapture right I'm ready you better be if
[27:09] you're born again you've been ready for
[27:10] the Rapture right when are we going to
[27:13] start confessing like Brother D said
[27:14] that's well we ain't never going to get
[27:16] away well well you you don't come to
[27:18] church half time well don't worry about
[27:21] that just make sure you come to church
[27:24] more
[27:26] right and I'm tell you you got to start
[27:29] confessing it before you can get to it
[27:32] amen amen and I believe this is going
[27:34] this is the the the last 3 years coming
[27:37] up here I believe that somebody's going
[27:38] to come to a place where they see a body
[27:40] change that's right oh yeah now whether
[27:42] you step into it or not that's right you
[27:45] know that's you but you better start
[27:47] confessing that you're in a place where
[27:49] you can number one it's like a um in
[27:53] deer
[27:54] hunting and and it's a really good
[27:56] analogy because because you know you go
[27:58] and you you go to a place and like
[28:01] behind my house we've seen little deer
[28:03] and little bucks and we saw two or three
[28:04] down below the house the other day real
[28:07] close within a quarter of a mile but
[28:10] then you look on these videos and you
[28:12] see
[28:13] these deer this big walking
[28:16] around well they're not in
[28:19] Georgia they're in Kansas and Ohio and
[28:22] Illinois where they e corn and soybeans
[28:24] all the time well you know what you can
[28:26] go hunting behind my house house for 30
[28:28] years and you ain't ever going to kill
[28:30] one you know why cuz they're not there
[28:31] that's
[28:32] right are you getting my
[28:35] anality you got to go where they are
[28:38] that's right amen and I ain't talking
[28:40] about lul just Lula church I'm talking
[28:41] about the ministry listen to a Ministry
[28:44] that can take you there why you going to
[28:47] sit somewhere and just shoot little
[28:49] bitty deer you know if you want a big
[28:51] one a little ones are okay but if you
[28:52] want a big one you got to go where it's
[28:54] a proven fact that they live
[28:58] okay it's a proven fact that big deer
[29:00] grow in Kansas cuz they eat corn and
[29:02] soybeans you know and they we got camera
[29:05] pictures of Georgia there's not that
[29:07] much well you going to stay in Georgia
[29:08] and say well I hope I kill one that big
[29:11] you just you know what you're doing
[29:13] you're in that mystery of iniquity you
[29:14] you know better you know better than to
[29:17] be there wanting that kind of a
[29:20] deer knowing that you got to go to
[29:22] Kansas to get it guys everybody
[29:25] understand what I'm saying you get this
[29:26] analogy you got to go where it's at
[29:28] that's right all right so and we got to
[29:31] see that that that God rightly divides a
[29:34] word of truth but you got to rightly
[29:36] divide it in yourself that's right right
[29:38] all these false doctrines you know what
[29:40] I don't
[29:41] even like I was telling Jun the other
[29:44] day people think and I'm kind of quick
[29:46] on the trigger trying to quit if you'll
[29:48] notice I've been a little more quiet I'm
[29:49] not so quick on the trigger but cuz I I
[29:52] heard a lady on the television or the
[29:55] radio the other day she said pray
[29:58] before you say that's right so I kind of
[30:01] stopped a little bit and kind of said
[30:03] okay how would you handle that you know
[30:04] kind of back off a little but anyway we
[30:06] got to come to a place to
[30:10] where we got to quit worrying about all
[30:12] these external thing you know people
[30:15] like U you know you take try to
[30:17] something now she and I can say things
[30:19] to each other that I surely couldn't say
[30:20] to Bow cuz it heard her F but she knows
[30:23] that we we talk that way but I'm going
[30:25] to quit do that cuz I apologize you know
[30:27] for something I said and U and I don't
[30:31] want to do that anymore I don't want to
[30:32] hurt anybody's feelings but what I'm
[30:34] saying is is we got to quit letting the
[30:38] devil stir all this up in our brain
[30:40] tomorrow the next day the next day you
[30:44] know Jun will do something and it just
[30:45] be toly dumb and so do I now we're
[30:49] geared different she'll let it bother
[30:50] her for a month I won't let it bother me
[30:53] for 5 minutes okay and she thinks now
[30:57] really she may think that I'm and I told
[30:59] her I said honestly whatever happened
[31:02] the other day I ain't thought about it
[31:04] never thought about it I'm on to
[31:05] something else I'm on to something else
[31:08] you need to go on to something else and
[31:09] quit like this right here if you keep
[31:11] letting it stay there brother Brandon
[31:15] made astounding statement he said here
[31:18] stands a lamb and there goes
[31:22] something
[31:24] away resist the devil and he will ride
[31:27] off flee from you you said what he's
[31:30] saying brother way listen the seals are
[31:32] nothing more than all the culmination of
[31:35] this
[31:37] message together in one in Seven Seals
[31:40] that's right that's all it
[31:42] is it's not some and it but it is a
[31:44] great mystery that nobody else has
[31:46] understood since the beginning of time
[31:49] Jesus was the only one who knew about it
[31:50] because you read it m i mean he preached
[31:51] him in Matthew all right right so let's
[31:54] read we got about 5 minutes let's read
[31:56] this but I want you to
[31:59] listen be focused on
[32:01] something like I said before you say
[32:03] something to me and then you come back
[32:04] to two three weeks later and go I sure
[32:06] sorry I know you I said what' you say I
[32:11] I just don't let things bother me
[32:13] anymore no I that you know with with
[32:16] even with your wife you shouldn't do
[32:18] that you shouldn't let things bother you
[32:19] should just you know there it
[32:23] go why clamor about it man we're we're
[32:26] head toward you know we we have taken
[32:28] the
[32:29] Baton in that last leg of the
[32:33] race and you know what that last guy
[32:35] does he don't think about nothing but
[32:37] finishing the Finish Line once he grabs
[32:39] that baton from that other
[32:41] [Music]
[32:43] [Applause]
[32:45] age it's kind of strange though that
[32:47] there's four
[32:48] legs to a to a race with the hand of
[32:52] Paton four just in case that in case b
[32:54] ghost didn't work the last one has to
[32:56] take it and you know what you put your
[32:58] fastest one
[33:00] last you put your fastest one last the
[33:03] best one is always last cuz if you're
[33:04] behind you know that joker going to
[33:06] catch up all right so that's the same
[33:08] way you're not saying well we ain't
[33:10] getting nothing we ain't doing forget
[33:11] about it people who's going to get it is
[33:13] going to get it who's not he not you
[33:16] can't help them except in a position to
[33:18] where you can talk to them that's right
[33:20] okay putting them down is not going to
[33:22] help them while now we beseech you
[33:24] Brethren by the coming of our Lord Jesus
[33:26] Christ now what that's what we're
[33:27] looking
[33:28] for and our gathering together unto
[33:32] him right not gathering in one place uh
[33:36] geographically but gathering in one
[33:38] place spiritually that you be not shaken
[33:40] in mind or be troubled neither by Spirit
[33:44] nor by word nor by letter as from us as
[33:47] that the day of Christ is in hand let no
[33:50] man deceive you by any
[33:53] means all right for that day shall not
[33:56] come except come and falling away first
[33:58] now we see that
[33:59] happening all right that's what that's
[34:02] what brother Brown said about this
[34:03] scripture Paul was trying to tell him
[34:05] look he did talk about the coming of
[34:07] Christ but it's not coming in my age
[34:10] Paul knew Jesus wasn't coming in his age
[34:12] cuz Paul was a prophet he could see to
[34:14] the very end he knew there had to be an
[34:16] end time come to where these people
[34:18] would receive it but no man de see you
[34:20] that except they comeing the Fall Away
[34:21] first and that man of sin be revealed
[34:24] now that word revealed a watch
[34:29] that word
[34:30] reveal is the same word in the Book of
[34:33] Revelation the apocal you know the the
[34:35] Book of Revelations is that actually
[34:37] called The Apocalypse okay but
[34:42] look take off the cover that is
[34:45] disclosed or revealed to uncover lay
[34:49] open what has been veiled or covered
[34:52] up down to the church ages Satan has
[34:55] veiled himself
[34:57] right along with Christ and when Christ
[34:59] is moveed he go right along with it now
[35:02] you see in the seals what happened in
[35:03] the
[35:06] seals Satan R talk why he's been
[35:11] exposed
[35:13] uncovered okay I like to use that word
[35:15] uncovered I know we say that Satan can't
[35:18] be revealed but the Bible says he was
[35:19] but that word revealed means to uncover
[35:22] he's being
[35:25] uncovered cuz listen Satan's number one
[35:27] thing is is to get a group of people to
[35:29] love him just like they love God right
[35:32] that's his whole thing is to get a group
[35:34] of people to think he's God worship Him
[35:37] think they're going to get eternal life
[35:39] through him think all these things yeah
[35:41] that's what Satan job is not to make you
[35:43] smoke drink run around cuss and no
[35:46] that's an attribute of his
[35:49] presence okay that's an attribute of his
[35:52] presence right okay it's an
[35:55] attribute
[35:57] you smoke drink cuts and run around
[35:58] because you don't have God in your soul
[36:00] that's right okay but what happens to
[36:02] the man the man was born with a desire
[36:05] to worship so they worship football they
[36:07] worship porn stars they worship you you
[36:09] hear what I'm saying drugs alcohol that
[36:12] consumes a person because God's not
[36:14] inside so that's what Satan want to do
[36:16] he wants you to consume yourself with
[36:17] something besides
[36:19] God but you and I have come to the place
[36:22] to where here stands a lamb and there
[36:24] goes something there there's some
[36:25] there's a separation between the
[36:28] two let son of man be revealed a son of
[36:31] predition who opposes and exalts himself
[36:34] above all that is called God or that is
[36:37] worshiped so that he as God sth in the
[36:40] temple of God Satan's here today making
[36:44] you go to
[36:45] sleep showing himself that he is God not
[36:49] like him is that's how he's come up in
[36:52] this age he's showing himself remember
[36:55] ye not that when I was yet WI you I told
[36:57] you these
[36:59] things and know and now ye know what
[37:03] withholdeth that he might be revealed in
[37:06] his time for the mystery of iniquity do
[37:09] already work so it already started
[37:10] working back in in Paul's a only he who
[37:14] now leth will let and brother R said
[37:17] that he is God leth will let until he
[37:21] us be taken out of the way cuz the only
[37:24] thing is helping when the only thing
[37:27] that's helping this world right now
[37:28] instead of going into total chaos is
[37:30] you're sitting here right you're sitting
[37:32] here today is taking all the is taking
[37:36] is taking the world from going totally
[37:39] off off the
[37:40] chart you and
[37:42] I and then shall that Wicked one be
[37:45] revealed whom the Lord shall consume
[37:47] with the spirit of his mouth what
[37:50] word and shall destroy with the
[37:53] brightness of his
[37:54] coming even whose coming is after the
[37:57] working of Satan with all power signs
[37:59] and lying wonders and
[38:02] all excuse me with all deceivable
[38:04] deceivableness of unrighteousness in
[38:07] them that perish because they received
[38:09] not the didn't say they rece did not
[38:12] receive the truth they didn't receive
[38:15] the Holy Ghost that's not just love for
[38:18] your wife that's that's a go love that's
[38:20] the Holy Ghost receive not the Holy
[38:22] Ghost of the truth that they might be
[38:24] saved right
[38:27] got it cuz if you don't have the Holy
[38:29] Ghost you got Satan there's only
[38:33] two that's
[38:34] it one way or the other all right so you
[38:37] got that so now next Sunday we'll read
[38:39] Matthew if you want to read Matthew but
[38:42] go into the fifth or sixth seal and read
[38:45] where brother brandom he breaks them
[38:46] down and show I've got them in my Bible
[38:48] I'll bring them next Sunday where he
[38:50] breaks each seal down first seal Matthew
[38:53] 24:24 all the way down he breaks them
[38:55] down and we'll read the first one cuz
[38:57] we're still just on the first seal that
[38:59] man of iniquity that mystery of iniquity
[39:03] that's what's got to be revealed in us
[39:05] that's in the Sixth Seal looks like it's
[39:07] the six around
