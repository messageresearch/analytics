[0:00] that purchase though it be tried with
[0:02] fire might be founder to praise and
[0:04] honor and glory or at the appearing of
[0:07] Jesus Christ and having not seen you
[0:11] love in whom though now you see him not
[0:15] yet believing you rejoice with joy
[0:17] unspeakable and full of glory what are
[0:21] you doing receiving the end of your
[0:23] faith even the salvation of your souls
[0:27] of which salvation the prophets have
[0:30] inquired and searched diligently who
[0:33] profits out of the grace that should
[0:35] come unto you now we're gonna get to the
[0:39] point in a minute at the revelation of
[0:41] Jesus Christ but I want you to I want
[0:43] your thought tonight in this line if
[0:45] he's Hebrews 13:8 no we believe it is
[0:50] then he's just as much in the Old
[0:53] Testament as he is in the New Testament
[0:56] right called us all the revelation of
[0:59] Jesus Christ we kind of look at it like
[1:01] seals and and Book of Revelations and
[1:05] things and we look at it as like you
[1:08] know a certain book but remember if he's
[1:13] Hebrews 13:8 then the Old Testament is
[1:16] just as important as the New Testament
[1:18] and Christ is in that Old Testament just
[1:21] as much as he's in the New Testament so
[1:24] then as you know that will be our
[1:25] thought for a while to try to make a an
[1:29] understanding of what we're trying to
[1:30] get because now what of which salvation
[1:34] the prophets have inquired and searched
[1:37] diligently who profits out of the grace
[1:40] that should come unto you searching what
[1:43] or what manner of time the Spirit of
[1:45] Christ which was in them did signify
[1:48] when it testified beforehand the
[1:50] sufferings of Christ and the glory that
[1:53] should follow under whom it was revealed
[1:56] it was made known to them that something
[1:58] was going on you know they knew
[2:01] something was taking place but this
[2:02] didn't have a clear understanding of it
[2:04] under whom it was revealed that not unto
[2:08] themselves
[2:09] but unto us they'd administer the things
[2:12] which are now reported unto you by them
[2:16] that have preached the gospel unto you
[2:18] with the Holy Ghost sent down from
[2:21] heaven which things the angels desire to
[2:23] look into wherefore gird up the loins of
[2:27] your mind and be sober and hope to the
[2:31] end for the grace that is to be brought
[2:33] unto you at the revelation of Jesus
[2:38] Christ all right now let's go to
[2:41] revelations 1 and we'll go verse 1 now
[2:47] remember there's to be something happen
[2:50] is to come forth from the Old Testament
[2:52] they spoke of it and all but then it's
[2:55] got to come into being
[2:56] all right into manifestation and there's
[3:01] I don't know how to say this part
[3:04] because it's in a thought pattern see
[3:07] there's a lot there's a gap between the
[3:11] Old Testament you know coming forth in
[3:14] the book of Acts and then it jumps to
[3:17] the Book of Revelations
[3:20] and I don't know how to make my point
[3:23] but to say that it is the unwritten
[3:28] through the ages all right
[3:31] then when it comes to the Book of
[3:33] Revelations then he writes it alright so
[3:37] there's a gap there I'll try to express
[3:40] that later in a message when we get to
[3:42] that point but I want you to think about
[3:44] it because here's what the Prophet had
[3:46] to say as we'll read in a minute
[3:49] paragraph 143 of the patents vision he
[3:52] says I want you to know who I am before
[3:58] I tell you what this is about in other
[4:02] words we'll read it a minute he's see
[4:04] he's wanting us to know who he is the
[4:07] first thing in the Book of Revelations I
[4:09] see watch the galaxy you got a gout from
[4:13] from what would you come up to Peter
[4:16] what's right for Revelation John James
[4:21] and I know and Jude all right now
[4:24] there's a gap between Jude I didn't look
[4:28] up to timewise
[4:30] but see timewise there would be a gap
[4:32] between Jude of 6m 800 or whatever it
[4:36] would be from dire - when John goes not
[4:40] just a to Patmos but it goes to Patmos
[4:43] and there's a time gap in that you
[4:46] you'll get the point of what I'm trying
[4:48] to bring so I'm trying to get you doubt
[4:50] in your mind to see how that you come to
[4:52] Jude earnestly contending for the faith
[4:54] nothing's written anymore
[4:59] then you come to John on Patmos and he
[5:02] writes it
[5:04] all right but it's not made totally
[5:07] alive not because she's not finished
[5:09] okay all right
[5:10] now we'll get to that as we go along
[5:14] because what's now the revelation of
[5:17] Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to
[5:23] show unto his servants things which must
[5:27] shortly come to pass and he sent and
[5:30] signified it by his angel unto his
[5:33] servant John who bare record of the word
[5:37] of God and of the testimony of Jesus
[5:40] Christ and of all things that he saw
[5:44] blessed is he that readeth and they that
[5:48] hear the words of this prophecy and keep
[5:50] those things which are written dar in
[5:53] for the time is at hand you may be
[5:56] seated the Lord that is blessing I
[5:58] believe that we're at the time to
[6:00] understand the time is at hand for us to
[6:07] understand now you you'll get the point
[6:10] because we'll we'll come back to this
[6:12] thought and we'll run the the thought
[6:16] over and over in your mind to to help us
[6:19] to understand what I was saying about a
[6:22] gap it's an unwritten part then it
[6:26] becomes written but remember he's
[6:32] writing about what has been what is
[6:38] and what is to be right that's how
[6:43] powerful the Book of Revelations is it's
[6:46] writing about what has been what is and
[6:50] what is to come November 18 95 96
[6:54] somewhere in there John Lee alright now
[6:57] then there's a lot to come so we're
[6:59] going to get into at the revelation of
[7:02] Jesus Christ we're going to eventually
[7:04] come back to the point to where we can
[7:07] follow it as the alive word the alive
[7:12] word the written word is wonderful and I
[7:17] don't misunderstand the thought this
[7:19] listen to the point the written word is
[7:21] wonderful I love to read the Bible don't
[7:24] you I've always loved to read it and
[7:27] study it or hear it of somebody else I
[7:29] love that scovia wherever what his name
[7:32] is where he oh you know because he's so
[7:35] Scorpia were that he's so good at
[7:38] pronouncing them words and I I get up
[7:40] there to them and the best way to
[7:42] pronounce the word when you don't know
[7:43] how to pronounce if you just pronounce
[7:44] it did you get what I said I said users
[7:48] will pronounce it see that's the only
[7:50] way I could do a lot of them works but
[7:52] he's so beautiful and and bringing it
[7:54] out and I would like that but now listen
[7:58] because here's what we want to start
[8:00] with go ahead and pull number one up and
[8:03] we'll get started with our thought
[8:05] because this is what I want us to think
[8:07] on for a while all right now he talks
[8:11] about the trumpet and approaching the
[8:13] great one approaching but look he says
[8:15] I'm saying I'm out for the mega the
[8:16] first again not announcement now listen
[8:20] this is not announcement of the second
[8:23] person this is not an announcement of
[8:27] the third party you know person but the
[8:33] only party okay now we were up to one
[8:37] guard all right now so I want you to get
[8:40] that point cause when you read it and
[8:41] you read what the Prophet said the
[8:44] revelation that God or the scripture
[8:45] said revelation and God give to Jesus
[8:48] and it looks like two people will
[8:51] remember the pronounce then are there
[8:53] you know there is it's not that away now
[8:56] watch what he says before I show you
[8:58] anything I want to let you know who I am
[9:04] then the Prophet describes who is the
[9:08] greatest revelation
[9:10] of all things is the supreme deity of
[9:15] the Lord Jesus Christ he says now you
[9:20] can't get to first base until you
[9:23] believe and workout you ain't even gonna
[9:27] get started now and I see that's why the
[9:30] Bible cannot open the Book of
[9:33] Revelations would never be able to be
[9:35] opened I don't care what you would study
[9:37] it or try to do it it can't be opened
[9:41] until you get to starting in the right
[9:42] place and the start in the right place
[9:45] is just what the Prophet said said Jesus
[9:50] in other words God was saying before I
[9:54] say anything else and bring all this
[9:56] other out I want you to realize Who I am
[10:01] all right so the whole key to the entire
[10:05] revelation see we can holler and say we
[10:09] quote this we could go over and say the
[10:11] revelation of Jesus Christ you know and
[10:13] we can say upon this rock I'll build my
[10:16] church and the gates of Hell shall not
[10:18] prevail against it you know and
[10:20] everything and we we can go through all
[10:22] of that and still not have it the right
[10:26] place right we can go through all of
[10:30] that point
[10:32] and still be just as Trinity as ever
[10:35] because the Bible don't read if ur for a
[10:38] Trinitarian a Trinitarian read this and
[10:42] he said the revelation and God give to
[10:43] Jesus
[10:44] Oh God give to Jesus to give to John
[10:51] well that's got to be - all right so the
[10:56] key to the whole thing to understand the
[10:59] book of Revelation now watch my point to
[11:02] understand the book of Revelation is to
[11:04] understand the deity of Jesus Christ are
[11:08] the Godhead
[11:09] alright now then we can back up all the
[11:14] way to Genesis 1 and say the same thing
[11:19] that the only way you'll ever understand
[11:23] the Bible it does not reveal three gods
[11:26] it doesn't reveal three persons or
[11:29] anything like that it reveals one true
[11:32] and living God all right now if we don't
[11:37] get that one true and living God correct
[11:40] then how can we say we understand what's
[11:43] in between in other words if if the one
[11:46] that said in Genesis you know in the
[11:49] beginning God created
[11:52] now if that was a now listen to the
[11:54] wording I got no sister no Jesus wasn't
[11:58] about during human flesh it's that time
[12:00] all right but yet if that wasn't the
[12:04] Lord Jesus Christ that created all
[12:07] things new
[12:09] then you're messing up all right now you
[12:13] come over through and you're getting the
[12:16] proof and here comes and walks upon the
[12:19] earth now the very god of creation that
[12:26] was bat dire that said let there be you
[12:31] know which was the Lord Jesus Christ now
[12:34] not human flesh we're gonna have to
[12:37] separate that enough to be able to get
[12:41] an understanding because I don't believe
[12:43] most people understand one God you know
[12:49] yeah that's just the point that came to
[12:52] me and and when I read that he says now
[12:55] before I show you anything I want you to
[13:01] know who I am
[13:03] we'll see if we don't know who he is all
[13:08] right
[13:09] look where we are so we say sure he's
[13:11] Hebrews 13:8 where do we see him just as
[13:15] real back dark
[13:18] now I know you can't find the flesh
[13:21] until four thousand years later to come
[13:25] upon earth I know that this don't don't
[13:28] misunderstand my wordings and get lost
[13:31] in something I say
[13:34] but if he's Hebrews 13:8 he's the same
[13:38] God that done the creating is the same
[13:41] God standing here to appear to John
[13:48] uh-huh well what a wonderful position
[13:53] that one is standing there because who
[13:57] was that that was standing there
[13:59] speaking to John the Lord Jesus Christ
[14:05] well that says the father that was
[14:08] gifted all right that's where we're
[14:10] going a half to get the Godhead in the
[14:13] correct order to be able to understand
[14:18] anything about the Book of Revelations
[14:21] and then saying the gap that appears
[14:26] back here comes within and then come
[14:29] back to this reality you will never
[14:32] understand what took place and how God
[14:35] is is made manifest all right so now I
[14:40] walk your thoughts to being in one one
[14:43] concert it'll get more interesting as we
[14:46] go along come on
[14:47] but I lay down to start with especially
[14:50] when I know that I'm I'm going to get
[14:53] into a series I try to get your thinking
[14:58] as far up in that series is I can get
[15:01] your thinking and then we back up and
[15:05] climb up the earth
[15:06] alright so now the key to everything me
[15:10] see you get the point now listen we look
[15:14] at the Bible
[15:16] now come on you said no we don't we
[15:20] wouldn't know if I'm trying to express
[15:23] our thoughts cuz we do we look at the
[15:26] Bible and our thoughts in the Bible
[15:31] really in reality comes up to the book
[15:33] of Acts or maybe the writings of the
[15:37] Apostles and then we have a 2000 almost
[15:43] year gap you know 1500 somewhere your
[15:49] gap between the book of Acts are the
[15:54] Apostles and the the end of time where
[15:59] we're at that's got to be filled in he's
[16:05] got to be filled in there listen that
[16:07] gap has got to be fulfilled in with the
[16:09] revelation of Jesus Christ so it's going
[16:14] to require that we go all the way back
[16:16] to Genesis with our thought about Jesus
[16:18] Christ and not just starting on earth I
[16:24] ask the question here one time because
[16:26] we were talking about trying to go into
[16:29] an understanding of son of man and I
[16:32] asked the question I said what's the
[16:33] first time that you see son of God in
[16:35] the Bible and I wasn't talking about
[16:39] written out son of gods and I was
[16:42] talking about where was you first see
[16:43] son of God well everybody related to
[16:47] 2,000 years ago in the shores of Galilee
[16:49] because that's what you were thinking
[16:51] about son of God when brother Adam said
[16:54] the logos the creator was the word which
[17:04] was Christ all right and being that word
[17:10] the word created all things so then the
[17:15] son of God is the creator and that's
[17:17] exactly what Peter said when he refers
[17:21] to Jesus when Jesus said who two men say
[17:25] how the son of man am Peter said in
[17:30] other words it was blindness plain
[17:32] language saying I now this son of man
[17:34] you're talking about I don't understand
[17:36] cuz there was no way for him to
[17:38] understand that so he said but now I'll
[17:43] tell you what
[17:46] now are the Christ Christ means the
[17:50] Creator you know eating the cross the
[17:54] Creator he said dark the Christ the Son
[17:57] of the Living God never can answer looks
[18:04] down in there and he says we throw it in
[18:06] three lives 9 said there's another one
[18:09] down in there now and said it's like
[18:12] unto the Son of God looks like if he'd
[18:16] seen him physically looking he would
[18:19] have said the son of man
[18:20] they had no reference he couldn't
[18:22] understand that that is more of an
[18:25] endtime understanding of Almighty God
[18:27] all right and you'll see what I'm trying
[18:30] to get to with the whole thing with the
[18:33] the gapless telling it goes from here to
[18:34] here because he even though Jesus spoke
[18:38] Matthew Mark Luke and John son of man
[18:40] son of man son of man son of man son of
[18:42] man but not one of the writers Paul the
[18:46] greatest none of them spoke us on a man
[18:50] he said well Matthew Mark Luke that was
[18:53] the writing while they were dire none of
[18:56] the Apostles in their understanding
[18:59] anyway reference to son of man they
[19:03] called him a son of God so that's why he
[19:07] would be Hebrews 13:8 and that's why the
[19:11] scripture would say that the Christ the
[19:14] Son of the Living God do we really
[19:17] understand one God I say without the
[19:25] Prophet no we'd hoped to go with our
[19:28] 1,000% we because he was the one that
[19:33] toute it will get back to that later
[19:36] when we get into the message later on
[19:37] all right but listen father my thought
[19:43] before I show you anything of the ages
[19:46] or anything
[19:49] I want you to see who I am alright so he
[19:57] wasn't the first person now listen
[19:59] so yeah I use for no he was not the
[20:01] first person I'm gonna run city wouldn't
[20:03] a second for the third person second
[20:05] person he said he wasn't even the first
[20:07] person he said he was the person alright
[20:11] he said well I was just caught that's
[20:13] just play a word no it's not the person
[20:17] is different from just saying the first
[20:19] person cuz we say the first person that
[20:22] means in essence of English language
[20:24] that could be another person right well
[20:28] when he said it that way see it's
[20:30] clinches it all down all right now
[20:32] trying to get us out to word that we can
[20:36] go into this book of Revelation but I
[20:40] want you to get this before you get in
[20:42] there as I saying we say Bible and we
[20:48] think that the Bible would come up to
[20:53] where the Apostles were you say but I
[20:58] don't do that in yes I'm sorry the human
[21:01] mind does that then we want to take the
[21:06] Book of Revelations
[21:08] and make it something in addition or
[21:12] added it's not the book of Revelation is
[21:18] the revelation of Jesus Christ the book
[21:21] of Genesis is the revelation of Jesus
[21:24] Christ
[21:25] now are you followed my thought if he's
[21:29] Hebrews 13:8 then we've got to see him
[21:32] as what the Prophet said say he said if
[21:34] you don't see Christ now you didn't say
[21:37] Jesus because you can't get it the other
[21:39] way but he said if you don't see Christ
[21:41] in ever verse so then he'd be John 1 but
[21:49] he'd also be Genesis 1 the same one in
[21:53] John 1 that comes to 14 to make him
[21:57] flesh he's the same God that done the
[22:00] creatin alright do we understand it that
[22:05] way
[22:05] and that would put the Son of God back
[22:08] down which is the word the creator see
[22:17] then that would would bring us to an
[22:19] understanding of one God okay so I now
[22:24] get to thought then what we're trying to
[22:26] get to we're trying to anchor our basis
[22:29] upon one true and living God because
[22:33] that's the only place we can base it we
[22:36] can't base it upon our concepts or
[22:38] thoughts or ideas well I think there's
[22:43] got to be at least two of them that's
[22:46] what a man at work one time we was
[22:47] talking you know and I kept on bringing
[22:49] it down and I you know I was just
[22:51] letting him do it and I kept bringing it
[22:54] down and he said what he's got to be
[22:57] three well then I kept talking and
[23:00] quoting scriptures and tying it together
[23:02] and just letting it so after a while he
[23:04] said well I guess you're right there's
[23:08] really just two of them I said well
[23:12] beings you're putting it that away why
[23:15] don't you go a little bit further and do
[23:17] away with one of your other gods and
[23:19] you'll get to the right place you know
[23:22] see because if he'd done away with one
[23:25] if the word do away with one they would
[23:26] do away with the second one and we just
[23:29] start back over again you know all right
[23:32] cuz you see now what is one true and
[23:34] living God
[23:37] you know see then we'll we'll see in
[23:44] reality by looking at mankind our own
[23:48] thoughts of ourselves because the Bible
[23:51] can be understood by the things that you
[23:53] know are naturally out here that's the
[23:58] scripture you know it can be understood
[23:59] the eternal Godhead can be understood by
[24:02] the things that we see all right now I'm
[24:07] gonna quote this and then we'll get back
[24:09] to it
[24:10] so you'll see where I'm headed to the
[24:11] point that brother Branham says it like
[24:16] this it was God in flesh
[24:21] and Jesus was God in flesh but listen
[24:31] and the Holy Ghost tonight is God in
[24:37] flesh now listen he said tonight showing
[24:42] to the church bring into Pisces promises
[24:47] all right now so we look at mankind and
[24:52] we understand the Godhead that's where I
[24:54] love the Prophet when he would explain
[24:56] something you know them theologians
[24:58] setting our boy they got him caught he
[24:59] drove up here a little you know and then
[25:01] brother Branham would just simply go
[25:03] through and he said well let me just
[25:05] give you a little illustration said I'm
[25:09] a father and said it I'm a son and said
[25:16] I'm a human being
[25:21] okay then he'd say well okay can't you
[25:26] see God as being a father son and human
[25:33] flesh without getting your Trinitarian
[25:36] concept involved because I'm not three
[25:39] people I have many manifestations right
[25:44] there's many manifestations in the human
[25:47] element see because Jesus and you know
[25:50] manifest in see he was out for a mega
[25:52] beginning in Rhoda Sharon lily of the
[25:54] valley
[25:55] he had many manifestations but he was
[25:59] only one person so now remember we're
[26:05] trying to get to the point of
[26:06] understanding that he's he's not the
[26:08] first person
[26:11] because that would mean that could be
[26:13] other person he's the person now brother
[26:18] branham may I make the statement he
[26:20] might I like to do this with us as human
[26:22] elements brother Brown said now if he's
[26:25] not Almighty God you and I are the worst
[26:28] to see people are it and then the
[26:35] Trinitarians could argue we you just
[26:36] don't as much opponent because they got
[26:39] scriptures but there I was listening
[26:44] reading North today where he said said
[26:46] he coated coated he said he didn't quote
[26:50] it he said he coated the scripture don't
[26:53] my Satan and what he does all right now
[26:56] do you look look at the human element in
[26:59] the human element there is easily to be
[27:03] understood a body all right now within
[27:08] this body that I am there is a spirit
[27:13] that controls this body
[27:16] you know and moves and does and
[27:19] everything all right and then there is a
[27:23] soul within this being that we are and
[27:27] see why it's so important and then
[27:30] listen what I'm talking about see why
[27:31] it's so important to understand the
[27:34] Godhead and to see it in the correct
[27:37] order because see I know and I always
[27:42] make this statement when I'm in this
[27:43] references to it because I know what
[27:47] happened brother Branham in his early
[27:50] ministry basically talked body soul
[27:55] spirit I said basically I'd say every
[27:59] time God you didn't but then when you
[28:04] come along about 62 right at the ending
[28:06] up 63 getting into the seals then he
[28:09] goes the body spirit and soul you said
[28:17] what if he was wrong why didn't he
[28:19] change that he wasn't wrong because he
[28:25] always brother branham always told body
[28:32] of five senses the second realm of
[28:36] mankind whatever you want to call it
[28:38] whether you want to call it spirit or
[28:40] soul he always talked the second room as
[28:44] to how memory reason conscience
[28:47] affections love and all like that all
[28:50] right he always talked the center room
[28:52] no matter whether he called it spirit or
[28:53] soul he always taught it as the center
[28:57] of your being with only one sense of
[29:02] reality in that which is the soul all
[29:06] right now so then if we can see man and
[29:12] what he is and then follow that as in
[29:16] God and what he is because we're going
[29:19] to stay right here on this one thought
[29:21] or not you know that we're going to stay
[29:24] on the point he said I want you to see
[29:27] who I am
[29:31] before I continue to bring out anything
[29:34] else I want you to see who I am like I
[29:40] said isn't that wonderful then could he
[29:42] be Hebrews 13:8 he would be the great I
[29:48] am the Creator the Christ the Son of the
[29:55] Living God as Peter said now remember
[29:59] you said well that really don't mount a
[30:00] mother there's crossing and the son of
[30:02] living garden and son of my Anna what
[30:05] does it matter about that Brody Dalle he
[30:08] just gets into all these things and
[30:10] makes it look like he knows something
[30:12] well I'm glad I don't know anything but
[30:14] I know him I see Peter when he answered
[30:19] Jesus didn't say Peter you're wrong
[30:22] you need a little better understanding
[30:25] What did he say
[30:27] he said Peter you're exactly right
[30:30] that's who I am and sit upon this rock
[30:34] of the revelation of who I am I'm going
[30:39] to build a church and the gates of Hell
[30:42] cannot prevail against it said it be
[30:45] against it but it won't overcome it
[30:47] right
[30:49] see then he was saying you're the
[30:51] Creator God what greater honor could
[30:55] Peter have given the Lord Jesus than to
[30:59] declare him to be the Creator when we
[31:03] know the flesh wasn't back there
[31:07] right now think women and then we'll get
[31:14] back to a point I've given you these
[31:17] many times in the prophets message but
[31:21] sometimes it's good to just read again
[31:24] brother branham own the message called
[31:27] the darkest hour then Jesus comes along
[31:29] go ahead and pull this one up and look
[31:34] what he says he's talking about the
[31:43] woman what was that she said she pulled
[31:47] virtue that's the reason he got weeks he
[31:49] pulled from him virtue through that
[31:52] human body of his listen cuz he was just
[31:57] a man now listen you stopped and you got
[32:00] a lot of things you you stopped reading
[32:03] you you you say I got it now listen to
[32:06] what he said he was just a man born of a
[32:09] woman
[32:12] Wow
[32:17] was he just a man that was borned of a
[32:22] woman
[32:23] no he's emphasizing that he was just a
[32:26] man that was born of woman he was
[32:28] emphasizing awakening
[32:29] I thought we got another one in a second
[32:31] that'll clear it up all right so now
[32:34] listen virtuous hear that through that
[32:37] human body of his cuz he was just a man
[32:41] everybody run said now he wasn't just a
[32:44] man see get the emphasis brother branham
[32:47] brains in this message and that's why if
[32:50] you'll do this
[32:51] listen sir if you just do it sometime
[32:54] and you get something that looks
[32:57] contrary get the emphases or the
[33:00] connection or the way he's using it he
[33:05] said well he said here he's just a man
[33:06] no hearing this one he said he's not
[33:08] just a man now which one do I want I
[33:10] want both of them cuz they're right well
[33:14] how can that be right because the Holy
[33:16] Ghost can put it together cuz he was
[33:20] just a man that's expressing what he was
[33:23] he was a man but then he's saying now he
[33:27] wasn't just a man why because he was God
[33:30] created in human flesh okay listen born
[33:37] a woman but his father was God but in
[33:40] his body he was a man in his spirit he
[33:44] was God so God was in Christ and the
[33:48] woman pulling that verse you're
[33:49] believing it through him then he turned
[33:51] back to her faith it pulled it see and
[33:54] she said who touched me no now listen
[34:02] as I said if you just take now I know
[34:07] the story and I emphasize this and I try
[34:09] to because I believe it helps helps me
[34:11] anyway brother Branham says our American
[34:15] language or our english language
[34:17] whatever it's so messed up he said we
[34:19] just don't know right because he said
[34:22] now like bored
[34:24] he said you got the word bored he says
[34:29] you can say a board because it's the
[34:30] plank he said then you can say come on
[34:34] board and you can say I'm bored with you
[34:39] well the three is the way their use can
[34:43] be different about what's the approach
[34:46] but now I've always said it this way and
[34:49] I believe it because this is what he
[34:50] said he said to before in the after
[34:53] explains it all right now the before and
[34:59] the after simply means taking anything
[35:01] in context that's the best way of saying
[35:04] it cuz that's what I was meaning a
[35:06] minute ago take what he's saying in
[35:07] context take what he was saying he's
[35:10] just a man in context of what he's
[35:12] talking about
[35:13] then take that he's not just a man he
[35:17] was God
[35:18] that's another context or another
[35:19] thought pattern or structure uh-huh see
[35:24] the before and the after explains it you
[35:27] go in the Bible you take the word spirit
[35:32] there is no difference in the definition
[35:35] of the word spirit whether it be holy
[35:39] spirit man spirit or spirit you won't
[35:43] find a definition to death you know
[35:45] there to tell you which ones which but
[35:49] if you know what is being used how it's
[35:53] being used
[35:54] you got it in the correct order right
[35:56] all right
[35:58] see now so I can say to you I can say
[36:02] come on board this year stand on this
[36:08] board because I'm bored with you now
[36:15] what have I done I've defined or
[36:21] emphasized the point that I'm trying to
[36:24] make right and see that's why brother
[36:28] Branham will say he was just a man then
[36:32] he said what do you learn just am I in
[36:34] and see people thanks that's
[36:36] contradiction it's not contradiction
[36:38] it's according to what he's speaking of
[36:42] you got to get the Bible in the correct
[36:45] order
[36:48] then you see them before and after we'll
[36:50] explain it it is like I said you take
[36:53] the word spirit
[36:55] let's see now let's see let me give you
[36:58] one that is the exact word he wrote
[37:00] around said where it says you know the
[37:04] not eternal word it's what is the other
[37:06] one forever
[37:08] yeah forever and ever he said that can
[37:10] be eternity
[37:12] you remember that this court much tumba
[37:16] he said but now also you can say that
[37:19] it's forever and forever and ever it's a
[37:22] space of time right now you've just
[37:27] defined what you're talking about
[37:32] right so when Jesus said I and my father
[37:37] are one
[37:41] he's explained what he's talking about
[37:46] it's not confusing
[37:49] it's our minds that's confused because
[37:53] we think and we're all real good we like
[37:59] to do it I'm the first one to come up
[38:01] with that nobody else had caught brother
[38:04] Dale saying that wrong I called him
[38:06] saying it wrong well my lord
[38:08] if you just to come tell me I'll tell
[38:09] you a lot of other things that's wrong
[38:11] wrong you know you got no problem but
[38:13] you might find out it's not too much
[38:16] wrong sometimes I read a quote the other
[38:18] day and I got a emphases back from a
[38:20] brother and on a note and his emphasis
[38:23] was that he was saying that I had
[38:27] probably changed something but it wasn't
[38:29] I gave you a quote the other day were
[38:32] that it was coming down and John the
[38:34] Baptist forerun the Lord Jesus Christ no
[38:36] never
[38:36] and brother Adam actually say us he said
[38:40] John the Baptist forerun Malachi 3 now
[38:47] that's the exact word well that can't be
[38:52] true but the same one that was in John
[38:57] the Baptist that forerun the coming
[39:00] Messiah was the same Elijah spirit
[39:04] whatever reference that you want to add
[39:06] back dark all right see brother Branham
[39:09] is riding what he's saying a lot of time
[39:11] but he's wording and he literally said
[39:16] he said that John the battery's full run
[39:19] Malachi 3 well that's not true
[39:23] John the Baptist really full run the
[39:25] coming of the Lord Jesus cross see I'm
[39:31] trying to help you to understand
[39:33] to illustrate like run around said I'm a
[39:35] father I'm a son and I'm a human how
[39:38] many are there of me it's just one just
[39:44] one well it's just one God though the
[39:50] Bible's right that the eternal Godhead
[39:52] can be understood by the things we see
[39:56] all right what did we read here
[39:59] in his body he was a man all right in
[40:07] his spirit he was God no that's still
[40:14] own number one you wanna put it back up
[40:16] where we can make sure and get it but it
[40:19] wants you to behold at that point I like
[40:22] feller said one time he said well if we
[40:24] can't argue about it call you do at
[40:25] least read it but his father was God
[40:30] listen but in his body he was a man in
[40:34] his spirit he was God sees in God
[40:43] standing on earth was a body
[40:46] we called Jesus a man his spirit was the
[40:57] spirit is under Townsend divers manners
[40:59] that spake to the father's in the
[41:02] prophets is that Scripture and his soul
[41:06] is what
[41:09] the very soul of Almighty God see now
[41:16] you can look at standing there and there
[41:19] stands the Lord Jesus the body you can
[41:22] see the spirits you can see the things
[41:25] that it works and makes it move and
[41:27] doing and and calling out and pray in
[41:30] and etc within his soul is a very soul
[41:33] of Almighty God now listen you can go
[41:41] back in the Old Testament I invite you
[41:44] to you can have a knowledge of the
[41:46] scriptures you ought to understand this
[41:47] any way that you find a lot in the Old
[41:50] Testament spoke of the Spirit
[41:55] and you don't find this much spoken of
[41:58] the word soul last hour don't understand
[42:00] me it's in the Bible and it's written in
[42:03] there but the emphasis is not upon that
[42:06] because he was not making manifest
[42:10] himself at the time as to be one that
[42:15] could give his soul a ransom he had to
[42:20] wait until he come into human element to
[42:22] be able to give his soul ransom oh you
[42:26] remember in the psalmist he said I found
[42:28] the ransom see joke found all of them
[42:33] found him what'd he say I know my
[42:36] redeemer liveth then that word know
[42:40] there's a whole lot deeper than just to
[42:42] say I know my brain he said I know my
[42:46] Redeemer liveth all right but now listen
[42:50] I ain't going a little bit further so
[42:52] we'll just take some reading cuz I want
[42:55] you to make sure and get it go to number
[42:56] two which is taken from excuse me that
[43:00] was yeah number 276 God keeps his word
[43:06] look I believe that in his body he was a
[43:10] man now here's where he explains what I
[43:13] said there well ago he was borned of a
[43:17] woman just like I was now watch him now
[43:26] taking that as a statement without
[43:28] correction and understanding what do you
[43:30] got
[43:33] you got a human element in a sex act but
[43:38] listen to it
[43:40] he was borned of a woman just like I was
[43:43] but his blood was not of a woman it was
[43:48] God and Jehovah God too low gosh who
[43:51] brood over the earth and my message this
[43:52] morning and rude the first man out of
[43:55] the dust of the earth overshadowed Mary
[43:56] and booted brood over her to fulfill his
[44:00] word and created the blood sail that
[44:02] brought forth the son of the Living God
[44:04] I believe in body he was a man I believe
[44:07] in his soul he was God he was God's
[44:11] manifestation here on earth so just look
[44:19] at that man as you see him and I said a
[44:22] moment ago that you can see him that in
[44:27] his life he could stand and go back into
[44:31] people's lives and and things you know
[44:35] they couldn't argue with him about the
[44:37] things because he that spirit that was
[44:39] within the Lord Jesus Christ would just
[44:41] go back into their lives and and he
[44:43] could explain these things and express
[44:45] the things as he did throughout the
[44:47] Gospels through his spirit because that
[44:50] spirit was a spirit and sundry times and
[44:52] in divers manners that was back there
[44:55] you don't see much references to the
[44:58] soul because it's not needed to
[45:00] reference back there to the soul it's
[45:03] there but it's not needed to references
[45:05] reference to that spirit all right and
[45:10] then when he came into Earth what
[45:13] happened a body thou hath prepared me
[45:21] now God provided a body to come and step
[45:28] into the God himself provided a body to
[45:34] step into he had done it on occasions of
[45:37] Melchizedek's and the different things
[45:40] but it would just be in and out in and
[45:43] out here he comes as a baby brother
[45:50] branham in façades and he said little
[45:53] Jehovah crying in a cradle lose your
[45:56] hova with no teeth now watch the
[46:03] reference did we make brother branham in
[46:07] his reference he said see there he said
[46:10] Jesus never called Mary his mother
[46:13] you remember that wasn't out what did he
[46:18] call her when he was 1 2 3 & 4 5 years
[46:21] huh
[46:22] come on be sensible he called her mother
[46:28] right his reference is calling it so
[46:33] that it would not put have to hit that
[46:35] she would be his mother that brought him
[46:40] because God created right
[46:46] God created what it took to make that
[46:49] body so when he said now she never
[46:53] called him mother to see that he called
[46:58] her him woman will see that's what he
[47:00] done on Calvary right
[47:06] do you father what I'm saying I'm trying
[47:10] to get your mind to thinking a little
[47:13] bit what a mind was a young it's running
[47:16] like a sewing machine going out the
[47:18] other end and you're not paying
[47:20] attention to what's being said see
[47:27] looking at a little baby laying in a
[47:30] manger
[47:33] there was Almighty God Elohim the self
[47:40] existing one laying in a cradle crying
[47:47] as a baby calling Mary mother her mama
[47:55] whatever you gonna call but it was not
[47:59] in a reference code he could not die for
[48:02] us as a baby
[48:06] it could not be your savior as a baby
[48:10] you cannot be your savior at 12 13 years
[48:15] of age or whatever when he come to his
[48:17] bar bar over how you say that word
[48:21] nevermind just kidding
[48:29] see he couldn't be your Savior even at
[48:32] 30 years of age he had to come to the
[48:39] time of AIDS and right before he could
[48:41] pay the price right then that would make
[48:45] him the savior are you listening
[48:49] trying to get a point to where we can
[48:51] see it there stood Almighty God as a boy
[48:56] running about upon the earth body
[49:00] now listen body spirit and soul to use
[49:07] this wouldn't mean anything to you but
[49:09] in the Baptist Church I heard the
[49:11] doctrine that man didn't have a soul
[49:14] maybe you've heard it or heard of it
[49:16] there was a doctrine back there that man
[49:18] didn't have a soul until the law okay
[49:23] because you had no conscience no no
[49:26] controlling factors or nothing that was
[49:29] a doctrine I see that doctrine among the
[49:31] people of this message
[49:32] cuz you see these people that are saying
[49:35] now that Jesus wasn't God till the River
[49:37] Jordan according to my Bible he was born
[49:41] God see they don't see what happened he
[49:49] was the Anointed Messiah sure on the
[49:52] River Jordan he became the anointed
[49:54] anointed right I agree with that I
[49:57] believe it - probably taught it he
[49:59] became annoyed kid with the fullness of
[50:05] the Godhead bodily
[50:06] what does that mean it doesn't mean he
[50:10] didn't have God back here it meant there
[50:13] some things about God that could not be
[50:15] made manifest as I just said the baby
[50:17] laying in the cradle can manifest a
[50:19] healer a savior it can't be done just
[50:31] looking at a simple little baby that you
[50:34] see you hold him didn't realize God can
[50:39] be seen
[50:40] well that brother now this is what I've
[50:42] been accused of so I say it don't matter
[50:43] if brother Dale you just making God to
[50:46] calm or to natural
[50:53] all I'm trying to do is read what the
[50:55] Bible said the Bible said God was in
[50:59] Christ reconciling the world and do
[51:00] himself I mean I didn't write there the
[51:04] Bible says of body thou hast prepared me
[51:06] I didn't Rock him things and Jesus
[51:12] standing there unless it shorts the
[51:17] father he said look if you've seen me
[51:22] you've seen the father
[51:25] right where was the father at he was
[51:32] right there standing in front of mankind
[51:37] was the very Almighty God that's why
[51:40] people couldn't understand it cuz they
[51:42] said you are to listen they said you are
[51:45] a man man I gotta get this right now you
[51:47] are a man making yourself God no it was
[51:51] God making himself a man they had it
[51:54] backwards he didn't have it backwards he
[52:00] was standing there as Almighty God not
[52:05] that there's another person up in heaven
[52:07] called the father and the sons over
[52:09] hearing the Holy Ghost and over there
[52:13] I had a better understanding of that not
[52:17] in the Baptist Church I admit it I had
[52:20] him so much one until he couldn't even
[52:22] stop his toe I had a lot of reading to
[52:24] do
[52:25] and I'd read a lot of it you better
[52:27] believe I'd read over and over but when
[52:30] brother Branham come along and said you
[52:33] know they beat him
[52:39] that was when I dropped that part of
[52:41] that Godhead I thought I understood
[52:43] maybe you've never dropped a lot of the
[52:46] things that you thought when brother
[52:48] mote nailed my hide to the wall and said
[52:50] now he's a father he's a son and he's a
[52:54] human he said but how many people was he
[52:56] I said wouldn't but one he said then
[52:59] you're just as much trinity as they are
[53:01] because you believe in three person I
[53:03] said I don't believe that anymore
[53:05] that's solve that I didn't have to wait
[53:09] three weeks and go to the seminary or
[53:11] ask anybody else how to do I've seen
[53:15] right then if I'd went back to my pastor
[53:17] and asked him we would have been in bad
[53:18] shape so I didn't go ask him I went to
[53:22] the head man I went to God himself
[53:26] I said lord thank you for revealing that
[53:30] to me and I don't see that three no more
[53:34] so now I know what I got to do I got
[53:38] this water baptism facing me and you
[53:41] don't realize what I meant
[53:45] so I was a Baptist deacon at 23 years
[53:48] old so you know they thought a lot of me
[53:53] and see I knew the Baptist doctrine the
[53:59] first thing the Baptist doctrine you
[54:02] can't have anything contrary to their
[54:03] doctrine listen you go right now you go
[54:11] right over here and join this church
[54:14] they won't ask you how you're baptized
[54:17] they just take you in you go down to the
[54:21] Methodists you go down to the
[54:22] Pentecostals you go to maybe somebody
[54:25] might catch on and say a little bit but
[54:27] you go to a Baptist Church today and you
[54:29] join that Baptist Church the first thing
[54:31] they're gonna ask you how was you
[54:34] baptized oh I was baptized name of the
[54:38] Lord Jesus Christ you will be baptized
[54:40] again before you become a member of this
[54:42] church
[54:43] that's Baptist doctrine that ain't just
[54:47] hearsay go check on it you won't ask
[54:51] June she you know if we don't throw off
[54:55] on it she done exactly what everybody
[54:56] else had done she went back and done
[54:59] that they made her get baptized again
[55:04] but listen Church what I'm trying to get
[55:08] you to see is how real is your God well
[55:11] I don't understand brother call my
[55:13] father I talk to him he's up in heaven
[55:18] and Jesus said on my father one now
[55:25] where's your God remember that
[55:28] background of what we're talking about
[55:29] before we go into anything in the church
[55:31] ages any thoughts or concepts in the
[55:34] ages and whatever
[55:36] to fill in this gap we must first see
[55:40] who he is see and he said what will it
[55:46] was a revelation that God give to Jesus
[55:48] to give to John
[55:51] and we'll get to that just remember the
[55:55] revelation that God gives to Jesus to
[55:57] give to John was the things that Jesus
[55:59] didn't understand when he was here on
[56:02] earth I've got the quotes don't worry
[56:04] about it he said but now to this time
[56:08] and his mediator will work he doesn't
[56:09] understand the future and everything you
[56:13] say yeah but but you're making it too
[56:15] you're making it why how could Jesus be
[56:19] God and not know everything oh I'm glad
[56:24] you thought of that I just read that the
[56:31] Holy Ghost in flesh in Jesus made him
[56:34] God you remember that or you read it
[56:36] well then the Prophet said and the Holy
[56:39] Ghost in you thanks God in your flesh
[56:46] the only problem is what I can only get
[56:50] the new Birds which is the birth of the
[56:52] soul now Jesus didn't need that birth
[56:58] because his spirit was the spirit under
[57:01] times and divers manners but his soul
[57:03] was the very soul that come all the way
[57:05] through that Old Testament and bringing
[57:08] it right down and never come into being
[57:11] in its fullness until a man walked on
[57:14] earth the soul is not it's back there
[57:20] you can pull it out if you understand
[57:21] things and read it you can see it
[57:24] because listen if you look at something
[57:26] that your prophet kept telling you about
[57:28] the soul that is very marvelous he said
[57:33] the soul is the nature of the Spirit
[57:37] right now if you go back in the Old
[57:41] Testament looking for a nature you gonna
[57:46] find his soul because that's what he is
[57:49] I tell you what though when he wrote the
[57:52] Ten Commandments I like Gary Atkins
[57:54] where he used to say he said we read
[57:57] them Ten Commandments and said we say no
[57:59] I shall not kill nice y'all not steal
[58:04] see like a mean hateful Oh
[58:10] granddaddy figure of a hatefulness
[58:14] reading a little deer that's y'all not
[58:17] kill change is it doing that's y'all not
[58:21] steal change the whole thing and then
[58:26] when the Prophet come in there with his
[58:28] anchor of the ten commandments always
[58:31] anchored within me when I read it
[58:35] he said call the 10 commandments - seals
[58:40] now you tell me the Ten Commandments is
[58:43] a book of rules I'm gonna ask you the
[58:44] seal to book a route I'm gonna ask you
[58:47] how the can the seal of God that reveals
[58:49] a the Holy Ghost itself be a book of
[58:51] rules I want some answers to some
[58:53] questions folks we're not playing games
[58:57] if you're gonna see one God get down to
[59:00] the basis of understanding brother
[59:05] Brennan said there was only one
[59:06] difference between a born-again believer
[59:08] in Jesus Christ now who wants to tell me
[59:10] what it is there's only one difference
[59:15] between a born-again believer and the
[59:19] Lord Jesus Christ he said that's the
[59:23] body that he lived in come on the body
[59:31] that Jesus lived in was not a sinful
[59:35] situation he knew no sin that Scripture
[59:41] are you following me about the Godhead
[59:46] Jehovah came down and was made tangible
[59:51] by living in the body of his own son
[59:55] declaring and recognizing the world to
[1:00:00] himself reconciling the world to himself
[1:00:01] that's on the message that's still on
[1:00:03] that now let's see where ya the Hebrews
[1:00:06] chapter number four three number three
[1:00:11] was made tangible by living in the body
[1:00:16] of his own son
[1:00:18] he was the tabernacle that God dwelt in
[1:00:24] what am I what my brother Dale he wasn't
[1:00:26] that - we've got brother so-and-so that
[1:00:29] teaches it he wasn't that until the
[1:00:31] River Jordan
[1:00:35] well I think we need to dish
[1:00:39] throw the prophets message out the door
[1:00:42] and I'll go up and follow that if that's
[1:00:46] what we think right but I don't think
[1:00:50] like a
[1:00:57] I believe the scripture that he was born
[1:01:02] Lord the crotch eight days later he got
[1:01:07] the name Jesus he was born Lord the
[1:01:11] Christ he was born Jehovah he was God in
[1:01:16] human flesh that human flesh was a human
[1:01:25] element as we just read not of the blood
[1:01:28] of his mother no with the blood of God I
[1:01:34] know and I hear brother Branham saying
[1:01:36] everything I'm not throwing off on
[1:01:38] nothing but people likes to sing that
[1:01:40] song now
[1:01:41] his royal blood now flows through my
[1:01:44] back no no no they ain't no royal blood
[1:01:46] at this day rowing in through your veins
[1:01:50] it's Dale and colleagues and Gabriel's
[1:01:56] fountains that's running through our
[1:01:58] blood running through our bodies those
[1:02:02] are good statements with very little
[1:02:05] background me I have a coach see we're
[1:02:11] gonna have to have a body change to have
[1:02:13] a body like unto his glorious body all
[1:02:16] right we got to come to a place to
[1:02:18] change this one okay but the new birth
[1:02:22] has already put him inside of you that
[1:02:31] that spirit in that man would know
[1:02:36] everything but remember one time and I'm
[1:02:41] gonna throw this out and listen Jesus
[1:02:45] didn't know everything and the courting
[1:02:49] brother branham him according to Bible
[1:02:51] they asked him in the Bible when he was
[1:02:53] coming he said I don't know said the
[1:02:55] father hadn't made that known alright we
[1:02:57] get to the book of Revelation so he said
[1:02:59] now at this day we understand he is
[1:03:01] alright
[1:03:04] me okay
[1:03:07] now think about it Jesus Christ was God
[1:03:16] that's the number four bottom part of
[1:03:19] what we had on on the other which is why
[1:03:22] Christ speak yet he was the son of God
[1:03:27] his flesh was the son of God because God
[1:03:31] created it but inside he was God it's
[1:03:38] not me said Jesus this works it's my
[1:03:41] father that dwelleth in me and that day
[1:03:44] you'll know that I'm in the father and
[1:03:46] father me and I and you and you and me
[1:03:48] now this conference number five he
[1:03:55] thirsted like a man he was a man in his
[1:03:59] body he was a man in spirit he was God
[1:04:02] God dwelled in Christ reconciling the
[1:04:05] world to himself he said bring me a
[1:04:07] drink he was thirsty all right now what
[1:04:13] is it
[1:04:20] you ever heard bread around him like
[1:04:21] this statement he said at times it would
[1:04:25] be Jesus speaking he said it was times
[1:04:28] would be the father speaking you ever
[1:04:30] heard that you see as father he would
[1:04:40] know when he was coming but in his form
[1:04:46] of son he would not know he say well
[1:04:54] that's impossible brother Deo you're
[1:04:56] trying to make it to carnal I'm trying
[1:04:58] to make it just as straight as I can
[1:05:00] what is that in you sometimes it tells
[1:05:03] you things is right or wrong when even
[1:05:09] the natural flesh says no you ever been
[1:05:15] another way your head God to speak to
[1:05:18] you and tell you something when
[1:05:21] literally as human elements you stood
[1:05:25] there saying no no I told you about the
[1:05:32] man that came here I try to illustrate
[1:05:33] it with that the man that came here with
[1:05:35] the church that stayed with us for quite
[1:05:36] a while he was real humble feller and
[1:05:38] prayed a lot and this is everything
[1:05:39] cried in the altar every day every
[1:05:42] service he was in and one day I walked
[1:05:46] up to him here in the church and I said
[1:05:47] brother I said something's telling me
[1:05:51] that you're a government agent you've
[1:05:54] heard the story ain't new you ought to
[1:05:57] know it ain't alive cause at least I
[1:05:59] told if I did I told it 10 times or 40
[1:06:02] times back before this lie
[1:06:03] either way you wanted I don't care I
[1:06:05] just know what happened in human flesh I
[1:06:09] was weeping because this man was so
[1:06:14] humble and me telling him that he was a
[1:06:17] government agent
[1:06:19] I said just do a good job mister don't
[1:06:23] lie about us ain't no need of it that's
[1:06:26] that I ain't gonna tell nobody he stayed
[1:06:30] for three or four weeks man he left went
[1:06:32] down to Atlanta I didn't tell nobody for
[1:06:35] three months why because my human
[1:06:39] abilities of all things that I was was
[1:06:43] arguing against whatever told me that
[1:06:47] was you ever had it to do that your head
[1:06:53] Lord tell you something now come on
[1:06:56] let's get down to real good about you
[1:06:59] remember when you saw water baptism name
[1:07:01] the Lord Jesus Christ you remember that
[1:07:04] it's contrary to everything in the world
[1:07:06] wouldn't and you knew 90% of he knew
[1:07:09] you're gonna be towed out of the church
[1:07:11] the minutes you got baptized Lord Jesus
[1:07:13] Christ right you knew you and heading
[1:07:16] out of that church
[1:07:22] and see humanly speaking you didn't want
[1:07:25] to believe that something spoke to you
[1:07:30] is it hard then to conceive a thought or
[1:07:33] understand that God and Jesus was one
[1:07:37] human element but they was a human
[1:07:39] element of him called a human flesh that
[1:07:42] had a brain that had all the capacities
[1:07:44] and everything we do as human beings
[1:07:50] brother and the scripture says it and
[1:07:52] brother brother said it he said I'd do
[1:07:54] nothing till the father shows me is that
[1:07:57] right then Jesus never done nothing till
[1:08:01] the father showed him the rest of you
[1:08:03] showed him a vision you know whatever
[1:08:06] art are you in me just thinking about
[1:08:10] how real is your God didn't there's no
[1:08:15] need to talking about the Book of
[1:08:16] Revelations or what we can understand
[1:08:18] this isn't that isn't that what it is
[1:08:19] for that until we understand who it is
[1:08:22] doing the talking
[1:08:25] yeah well I've been taught it was a
[1:08:26] father and a son the holy goat so have
[1:08:31] we all welcome to the crowd well came
[1:08:36] through that but does that make it right
[1:08:40] no let me ask you straight on this
[1:08:46] question are you willing to die for what
[1:08:48] you believe you're willing to die for
[1:08:52] the fact that your baptism in the name
[1:08:54] of the Lord Jesus Christ is correct I'm
[1:08:58] just asking a simple question he's
[1:09:00] saying nothing when you got done draw it
[1:09:01] out and start shooting about it we're
[1:09:04] just talking asking you how real is your
[1:09:08] God
[1:09:17] then you might be able to father it a
[1:09:19] little bit and look back down and see
[1:09:22] that Melchizedek walk out to Abraham and
[1:09:25] who was melchester
[1:09:28] Almighty God not born of a woman and
[1:09:35] come up that way that would be left for
[1:09:36] the fact of the body that would be
[1:09:38] brought into the world for the purpose
[1:09:40] of dying melchester that couldn't die
[1:09:43] for you he wasn't in that capacity but
[1:09:48] brother Branham said he was a man the
[1:09:50] Bible says he was a man well you mean to
[1:09:54] tell me you think God is a man no I
[1:09:56] won't tell you the Bible and the profit
[1:09:58] both says he is now you do what you want
[1:10:01] to about what you think about what I say
[1:10:04] but just remember the Bible said then he
[1:10:09] was a mine
[1:10:14] well you know if he's Hebrews 13 nights
[1:10:17] and he still got to be a man
[1:10:25] how real is your God now let me ask you
[1:10:29] a question if I'm right about what I've
[1:10:35] said
[1:10:35] I think I am but I'm just saying it
[1:10:38] that's up to you if I'm right about what
[1:10:41] I've told all the years and not just
[1:10:44] tonight because that says what I've
[1:10:45] always taught on the one true and living
[1:10:47] God won't ask you a serious question
[1:10:54] could your revelation produce a lamb to
[1:11:03] pay the price for you could you stand
[1:11:07] this John and say behold the Lamb of God
[1:11:10] that takes away my sins could you stand
[1:11:14] on that could you follow him throughout
[1:11:20] the word and see Almighty God as he was
[1:11:23] manifesting himself like I said we we
[1:11:30] don't think about the Old Testament we
[1:11:31] think you see who's a mean hateful oh oh
[1:11:34] dude there's a lot of things I'd like to
[1:11:37] talk to you about in the Old Testament
[1:11:38] to where you can see the the Christ the
[1:11:42] nature of Almighty God if you just look
[1:11:46] at it right you can see his nature his
[1:11:49] ways and everything right throughout the
[1:11:51] Old Testament
[1:11:57] and you can understand a lot of things
[1:12:02] that mankind has never had the ability
[1:12:04] to understand how that Almighty God
[1:12:09] would forbid a man to marry a woman that
[1:12:16] was you know the wrong top right does he
[1:12:25] tell us not to tell you that true but
[1:12:30] then he turns around one day to his
[1:12:32] prophet needs to go down there and marry
[1:12:33] that and how children bar read
[1:12:38] your Bible you might find a few things
[1:12:40] that's interesting well you don't want
[1:12:45] that same prophet after a while that
[1:12:48] woman left him went off of somebody else
[1:12:51] I didn't say go down there and cut her
[1:12:55] to pieces and kill her and divide her up
[1:12:57] and do this he said go get her and bring
[1:13:01] her back he went and got her brought
[1:13:04] about and had more children see we just
[1:13:07] don't read the Bible all the way through
[1:13:12] read it for yourself and see where it's
[1:13:16] after but you understand see you can
[1:13:21] look back there and see how that God
[1:13:24] would kill those people for doing
[1:13:28] certain things you can't see the grace
[1:13:32] of God his wage trying to bring out in
[1:13:34] Grace and things if you can't see the
[1:13:36] Jesus of the Old Testament
[1:13:39] just remember David
[1:13:44] that had a man kill which was his
[1:13:47] greatest buddy a man that wouldn't even
[1:13:51] go home to his wife when he just laid at
[1:13:53] the door and wouldn't go home so honored
[1:13:56] David David had him killed
[1:14:02] Nathan comes to David and he says David
[1:14:05] said songs will happen this happen that
[1:14:07] happened David says bring that man here
[1:14:10] and I'll kill him
[1:14:12] he didn't mean nobody else gonna do it
[1:14:15] he said bring him here I'll kill him
[1:14:18] what the Prophet say he said David thou
[1:14:25] art the man but watch him redress your
[1:14:30] Bible he said what you ain't gon die
[1:14:37] he said David said there's some problems
[1:14:40] here in this lineage is in time but said
[1:14:42] you ain't gonna be able to build me a
[1:14:45] tabernacle so we're gonna leave that for
[1:14:48] Solomon your son David says glory
[1:14:50] hallelujah come on boys
[1:14:53] I want the Cedars out 11 them I want to
[1:14:56] read you Bob
[1:14:57] David the equipment for Solomon to build
[1:15:01] the temple he brought it all and set it
[1:15:05] down and said Solomon built the temple
[1:15:07] read your Bible there's a lot of Grace
[1:15:13] in the Old Testament if we just look at
[1:15:17] it and right away it's not disgrace
[1:15:19] either it's real truth my god is so much
[1:15:26] Grace and so much love until he told
[1:15:29] King he said if you'd have done right
[1:15:35] you'd have been accepted oh of course
[1:15:38] the people in the message say no that's
[1:15:40] a lineage it cannot be accepted well God
[1:15:43] said it and the Prophet said he said it
[1:15:44] so that's all I wanted to know what
[1:15:50] about it
[1:15:51] come on musicians I just asked you he
[1:15:56] said now I want you to know who I am
[1:15:57] then we'll start talking about these
[1:15:59] other
[1:16:01] how real is your God
[1:16:11] I'll reel
[1:16:14] let's see we don't take the scriptures
[1:16:18] well brother tail there he walked upon
[1:16:22] the shores of Galilee and everybody saw
[1:16:24] and the Bible says no man has seen God
[1:16:26] at any time I like that you know why
[1:16:32] because God was in Christ veiled in a
[1:16:38] human vessel to pay a price reconciling
[1:16:43] the world to himself that's why I love
[1:16:47] the word so much it's got its own
[1:16:48] answers but we have to let it understand
[1:16:54] we have to let it be what is that see
[1:16:57] now just study there in the in the first
[1:17:00] chapter and then we'll pick up a few
[1:17:01] things a few thoughts and and we'll go
[1:17:04] on in to because I want to get into the
[1:17:06] church ages where I want to get because
[1:17:08] my point then I started this you
[1:17:11] remember my point I said we're gonna get
[1:17:13] into the each age the overcomer
[1:17:25] you don't want that age that overcomers
[1:17:27] you ain't Jesus he's me and you what do
[1:17:37] we got anybody have a need the altars
[1:17:41] open see just think about how real is
[1:17:45] God now there you make him so real it
[1:17:52] seem like that and he's just tangible to
[1:17:55] you well why not why not why is he not
[1:18:03] tangible to you well I've never seen him
[1:18:07] what does that mean he's not real
[1:18:16] what about it hot what have you saying
