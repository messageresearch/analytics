i'm ready you can take my god you can't take me for granted angels watching over me i ain't afraid totally don't try to entice him when he comes by there amen amen amen you enjoy that amen god bless you in the name of the lord for the time you're sitting right up here don't you come amen i would say this is a hazard bunch but uh you know god i'd rather amen well god bless you all um you want to know how i broke my arm eve fell and i broke my arm but i'm grateful to be a christian today this message has been very special to me i don't really have anything planned to say it's not my time to speak anyway but i want to be found faithful during hard times and if you've ever prayed for the kishan family now be a good time i guess i get to be like job just a little bit and uh i'm proud because i already know the answer i will never give up my faith the harder things get the harder i'm going to pull myself to calvary's hill amen i don't care what happens i don't care if i fail i'm still going to calvary's hill and i'm grateful i found in life too you can't get along without another part of your body my life is messed up right now every time i go to do something my right hand wants to work but it's broke amen and i think of the body of jesus christ we need one another we need one another i look i look out here and through the years you've given me your friendship i appreciate that so many of you have helped me i appreciate that now i need your help i need your prayers amen amen and uh i'm grateful the bone will heal why because the word promises the bone will heal amen the body of christ is going through lots of struggles and lots of trials and i think why would my arm break when nothing happens by accident and i think of the story of gideon when he had all those soldiers to fight the enemy with lets me always lean into the arm of the flesh to fight my battles so he took care of that and i found out that i can do more with the broken arm than i could do with true strong arms if that would be the lord's will and that's the lord's will we've come a long way in this message and we've got a little ways to go it's no time to quit it's time to you know i think if god has honored me to take the place of job and if there was a conversation in heaven and he says look at the crescend family the good lord would say look at how they please you look at how they love you and satan says yeah but i can turn that around i'll start messing with their health i'll start messing with their kids i'll start messing with uh with uh i'll create misunderstandings and the lord said do it and if that be the lord's will and if that is what happening let me tell you right now i will never leave this message i will never stop serving god if i'm dying don't be crying for me put my hand in the air so i can worship the lord i have never been more convinced of this gospel i have never been more convinced of healing deliverance and i need your prayers and i need your support and i've got it and i know i do and that's love feels really good amen this message will never fail because love lifts it up i remember praying and praying brother samuel it just didn't look good for brother youssef did it and i remember we kept praying and kept praying and kept praying and something started knocking on the door of heaven and you know what today i saw a picture of on on the internet he's over by the beach with his with his wife and he's walking with his two boys and he's a free man why because that's the god we serve but you know we have to have patience sometimes and if god you know we tend to fight our battles with the arm of flesh and he doesn't want us to we tend to be filled with great faith when we see things going well or when we hear things going well so god took my sight and showed me things that i need to see in the spiritual we need to fight by what we believe because if we look at the political realm if we look at the educational realm if we look at the moralistic realm or the religious realm you won't be happy if you look at your financial situation you won't be happy but if you continue to look to what you believe something he can't touch and i've learned one last thing i'm sorry i'm talking too much but in dealing with the devils you better just tell them the truth because they know if you're bluffing you make sure look him right in the eye and say you know what devil the word of god is stronger than you isn't it it'll have to say yes jesus promised healing for his children didn't he he'll have to say yes but don't go saying you're going to get a milky way candy bars from mars because he don't have to say yes stick with what's the truth and they have to listen amen learn to fight the way the bible says to fight these things and god help us to do it because if you don't fight it right he will bring troubles to you he'll bring trials to you and someone says you can be honored because trials are upon you that means god can trust you so i want to be trustworthy i will serve god if i come back next time and both arms are broke and both legs are broke you'll see me in a wheelchair up here telling you i trust god because i will you know he said he'll never leave me nor forsake me and if he's inside of me guess what i won't do with him i will never leave him nor for save him amen how could i leave someone who saved me how could i turn down this great message this great christian life if he saved me we need to just know what we have know what you have and stand on what you have anything extra unique god will bring to pass but i love him with all my heart and i can't explain why part of my life is just going through torture in the other part of my life i never felt such peace and i don't understand all that's going on but i know one who does so be praying for the christian family i guess uh some grew up on me and they got jobs and others got things i don't know how that happened i brought a bunch of nice young kids and now they turn into young ladies and gentlemen my oh my look at christopher they're in your crutches and i feel right at home here up there but uh come on up anna and the boys i guess we got a song and sarah said will you sing with us daddy i said i sure will honey i love singing to the lord amen she said i'll get your words last one uh little david oh so small the giant oh so tall the odds were just too high for little david so we shook off all of his foes but with the power of god he was close the battle's not blind i give it to you lord it's fine the battle's not mine said little lady lord is i give it all to you i know not what to do the battle's not mine i give it to you lord it's fine now little david unafraid before the giant he stood that day it seemed to be the end for little david but like the lion and the bear that he flew that old giant would come down too the battle's not mine i give it to you lord it's fine the battle's my mind said little i give it all to you i know not what to do i'm so glad you made me see lord you're really all that i need the giants stood so small sweet victory had rained for little david for he gave the battle to one that believed in getting things done but the battle's not mine i give it to you lord it's time i know not what to so do you made me see lord you're really all that i need the battle's not mine i give it to you lord it's bad i give it all i'm so glad you made me see lord you're really all that i need the battle's not mine i give it to you amen thank god for that huh amen amen brother sam amen praise the lord amen so you want to fight david huh gonna fight the line or the buyer or the giant which side we want to be on we got to make our choice today that's what i asked the sister asked me one time about a sunday school classes what do you want me to teach them kids i said teach them their little david with a slingshot and they can take down any giant and it comes their way because i wanted to talk the word of god right that's what we need and turn out to be what if you had all david's what if all of the army would have been a david when it needed but two david could have told the other guy what to do that's all you need that's all god needs one in his hands are digging you amen you love the lord come on sister freda just pray for us over in georgia everything's running real good so it must be something wrong you um suppose god searched through heaven he couldn't find one willing to be the supreme sacrifice that was needed to buy eternal life for you and me oh had it not been for a place called mount calvary and had it not been for the old rocky cross had it not been for a man called jesus then forever my soul would be long i'm so glad he was willing to drink his bitter cup although he prayed father let it pass for me i'm so glad he didn't call to heaven's angels from my hands pull these nails that torment me oh had it not been for a place called mount calvary had it not been for a man called jesus then forever my soul would be lost amen amen is that true or not hey amen amen bro jay come on we're going to get to wait for brother tony and kind of getting settled take a nap for a guy here look like he's already done that brother amen good to be in the house of lord today amen to god i like that little david amen the battle is not mine belongs to the lord amen we just had our song leader to graduate from this life to the life beyond amen and you know what tell you what it pays to be ready yes it does for an hour you think not it's coming amen amen to god it's coming to all of us amen but one thing about it we knew he is ready that makes a difference brother homer when somebody's ready you know i told somebody at the funeral home the other day i said you know it makes different when you stand over somebody your nose ready and somebody you don't know whether they're ready or not i had to stand over one of my brothers and just i didn't know where he stood at with the lord i just had to put it in the hands of god and say god you know whether he was or whether he wasn't you know amen i think about brother i'm talking about that young girl that time it almost drowned and he said god said i'd a tucker then but she wasn't ready so that give me a little hope brother homer praise the lord thank god for the revelation that god has given in this hour you know we got to hope the world ain't got today we got something that can drive us right to that point it's the seat of god laying down inside of us and

brother brain david told me you ain't preaching no no just reference he said i had a lot of books that's what his pastor told me when i went down the other day he said well you got a lot of stuff right you know they said used to be that you could tell how long a guy was going to preach according to the stack of books he had when he came up to the pulpits you know so but we uh sure won't say we love the lord and man he was talking about my youngest daughter i don't know if you all know her sister bethany she's about nine brother homer come down last year and preached a meeting and after the meeting was over we got in the car to leave she looked over at mom and she said can i marry him mama's mom's no he's already married honey so she got down to mcdonald's and told brother dave she says but dave she said i think we need to have a yearly meet and come get this guy to preach it so so so needless to say they're buddies she thinks he's good-looking and the best preacher at walks so what are you going to do abby you got to like her you know i mean amen and that's sister sister sister gracie and mariah grace and we thank her for coming it's good to see everybody such a good atmosphere today and welcome to spirit amen if we just bow our hearts before we enter the word heavenly father lord it's such a wonderful day to serve you and a beautiful time and season father and lord as your people have gathered in this place this morning lord and they've begun to worship you and love you and lord we feel the the atmosphere lord the spirit of grace that's moved among us and lord we're just asking you now that you would help the speaker and lord help us to say something lord that would would prick the hearts of the believers lord that would lord help us to take another step lord encourage our faith strengthen us lord as we love you and want to serve you with all of our minds father we ask you to bless these people father that have come now help us father in jesus name we pray amen and amen uh we're going to look into the bible in the book of luke in the book of luke the fourth chapter and we want to look in the in the 17th verse and i know that i'm not going to be able to say a lot about this but i won't just take a few minutes and the lord would use something here in our hearts and that was delivered unto him the book of the prophet isaias and when he had opened the book and he found written found the place where it was written and book of isaias of course is the book of isaiah and this was handed to jesus when he was in the synagogue on the sabbath day and that book of isaiah having 66 chapters in it but said it was a conclusive bible in itself that he wrote of everything from the beginning plum to the end and so jesus had in his hand the compiled bible that was from eden all the way over and he chose the place that was written in the book for the morning that he was ministering to the people that he was speaking to so he found the place where it was written and then the spirit of the lord is upon me he began to read isaiah 61 and verse 1. the spirit of the lord is upon me because he hath appointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives recovering of the sight to the blind and said it liberty them that are bruised and to preach the acceptable year of the lord and then he closed the book and he gave it again to the minister and sat down and the eyes of them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him now you that know isaiah 61 knows that he didn't finish that's that's that sentence there he left a portion because it wasn't for that morning and the following statement he was going to say and this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears amen we just asked the lord to bless the word as you may be seated this evening i want to talk to you just for a few minutes on a reflection of the seasons and you know i've been studying on the seasons the last little bit the lord been dealing with my heart and and you know i i've been looking at something that that i think that is is the time and the the season that we're living in and you all know what brother branham had to say about it that of course it's the greatest seasons that could be ever lived in is a season that we're living in and the bible uh predicts about it i i look at how the bible speaks of the coming of the lord and brother brahm said you know he said our lord jesus when he was dying he said he had more to say about his second coming than he even did about his death burial and resurrection he said because it was something that was of great importance amen and we know that we're living in the season of that coming and and looking at the time and the seasons i believe that that god by a divine intelligence anoints people to live in the season that they're put in i i don't i don't believe that we can just say it's some kind of an accident that we're all sitting here today and and we've all gathered in this building at this particular time and out of 6 000 years we've got breath to breathe right now that we have a body to to reflect in this time and and having done that we know that god himself picks the and chooses the ages where he reveals his word and it's up to him to make that season live and it lives by the word that's revealed in its time the prophet of god told us he said you see the catholics didn't know nothing about martin luther's message and john wesley know nothing about luther's message and the pentecostals he said they know nothing about this message he said see he's going to reveal it in its season because it's a seed and it grows and matures he reveals himself in one place brother branham says see god reveals this word in the season and to whom he chooses to reveal it to isn't that something that god holds the sovereignty of this he's going to reveal a word in a season but then he even chooses who he's going to reveal it to so hey man so you know you look at how that people set up all these organizations and all these great plans and this is going to be the way god's going to do something but god is always bypassing what man plans to do and he comes and gives it to a person or a people that he chooses to give it to god don't have to use the programs man sets up god's got his own program and he's by divine intelligence lays that program out and puts a people in it that he can choose it himself you know to think that god chooses to who he will reveal it and he done this choosing before the world even began all of his doings were foreknown by him but they're hidden from the man see god reveals them as he will in a chosen season to a chosen person and he never did choose a party or sect he chooses a person and that's how that god does it god chooses now if there's going to be a choose and it's it's hidden from man but it's something known to god so therefore god can display it in all of the attributes of the of the world and of the other plants and in the word he could write it all there and it's all hidden from man but for known of god so he can lay it out just as it would do it but it's still hid from man of what he's going to do it's a divine intelligence it's a wisdom that's higher than man and and when you look and see how that god's intelligence that that intelligence is what planted a cactus out in the deserts it's the same intelligence that put a pine tree on the mountain when you look at that intelligence that intelligence is what we're looking at today when the prophet of god said that divine intelligence put those things where they are because he knows what it takes for that to live in a certain atmosphere or a certain time when you when you think of the the atmospheres that it takes for a cactus it's a lot different than that what takes for a pine tree but the god of heaven knows where the atmosphere is and what it is this this is the same god now amen that created the world and before he could ever bring adam and eve god had to create an atmosphere to put them in so for out of six days god was going to create he spent five of them days creating an atmosphere just to bring his children into and when you look and see that for six thousand years man has been on the face of the earth but god has been hiding something from man amen since the beginning something that's been hid and the prophet of god said the reason is there wasn't a people who could comprehend what god was wanting them to see so there was something god's been waiting on there is something he's been waiting on what he's been waiting on it's a bride that could understand the revelation of of the manifestation of who that he is when you think of this today that divine intelligence amen to build an atmosphere when you look at the atmospheres that god has built the atmosphere for the last 2000 years leading up to something leading up to a great something knowing this that man does not live in the top of the mountain he knows that the lion doesn't live in the top of the mountain he knows that it's only the eagle that lives in the top of the mountain this bright church was not anointed to live in the faith age she was not anointed to live in a knowledge age she wasn't anointed to live a man in an age of virtue or knowledge of patience or godliness but she went plumbed to the top where the cat stone is coming down because the anointing that is on her is to receive christ not not a teaching a man she's not anointed to receive a church or an understanding of man but divine intelligence is so anointed this people to receive christ in the hour that he would reveal himself amen i'll tell you this it's a divine intelligence that puts her there see it's brother by him says you know you can take a bunch of trumpets and lay them all out he said but there's no difference in the trumpets he said the only thing you're going to know any difference is the intelligence of the one playing it hey man he said he said i'm just a trumpet he said but there's some intelligence that's behind it when you when you think of what a trumpet player can do they can take you know the greatest music in the world could be written on the sheet of paper and handed to you but if you don't understand sheet music it has no value to you you could be holding a beethoven's work or mozart's work and it wouldn't mean nothing to you because you have no way to interpret the symbol that's written on the page but if somebody who has an ability to interpret the symbol can put a sound out that'll bypass the borders come on of religion it'll bypass the borders of language one beautiful thing about music is it has no boundaries it has no education or no education it has no boundaries it has the same sound and a man with a trumpet that understands the symbol can give a sound of understanding to all walks of life amen and so has been the manifestation of christ in the hour that we're living him when that manifestation takes place it goes across the borders of societies of languages of racial differences it bypasses the whole thing and raises christ among the people the symbol that was written in the bible is no longer a symbol it is a divine intelligence made manifest in our hour to bring a group together that would be called believers oh brother when i think of this when i think the trumpet sounding amen oh how he can pick it up amen when that when that in the beginning god had something in his mind but when he wrote it out in the bible it was a book of symbols and it laid there as a symbol and said it would remain as a symbol it would remain in silence until the end time there was going to come somebody with an understanding that would sound the mysteries of this bible and make the symbol a meaning to the people that is sitting there i'm on the white horse has a meeting now that black horse has a meaning now the pale horse has a meaning now but so does the eagle have a meaning it means power to the church it means life to the believer it means rapture to the saints of god it's amen it means something today the prophet of god said see the next thing to come is the divine intelligence we're not living in a foot age no longer we're not in a hip age this evening we're not standing a shoulder age or a mouth age or even the ih but a divine intelligence has come down among the people it's god's thinking about god's own word oh when i think of this i'll tell you this we're at the top of the mountain now hey man the place where the headstone comes and meets the body under that meeting what a beautiful thing it's a time when god is calling his people to him when god is calling his people out of this babylon system and all the ideas of man and bringing them out of the filthiness of the understandings of man's ideas and bringing them out in a place where they can believe god and into an atmosphere where all the unbelief is done away with and all the ideas of free gods and misunderstandings of being a church member and living in sin and ungodliness in their life amen god is bringing the people out to an atmosphere to believe every word the bible says i believe everything that god says about it in his word when i look at the scriptures jesus picked the season and then he picked the word and identified the season they was living in in the word he took the word and said to them if you were living in jesus time and you were poor do you know you could have got up and began to shout if you were captive you could have got up in claim i'm free what was bringing it the word in its season had brought an anointing to the people that were declared in the scriptures oh brother when you begin to look in this bible and see that god has a season he has a word for a season and the hearer of that word reflects the season they're living in all the people that heard martin luther left with something they didn't just get a shot in good time they left with something they left justified the people that was under john wesley they didn't just hear something amen that they could leave and say i was a good sermon they left sanctified by the word that they were hearing those pentecostals got an anointing of visions and gifts and prophecy and tongues but this bride is going to leave with something brother so he's got her arm in the arm of the word and god's going to leave with something he's going to leave with a pride we're taking a rapture church we're taking it by the season by the word and the season we're living in oh when you look in this bible it reflects what time we're living in in revelations the 18th chapter he said i saw another angel coming down from heaven having a great power and the earth was lighted with his glory and he cried mightily with a strong voice saying babylon the greatest fall and it's falling look at what he had to say about her she's become the habitation of devils and the hold of every foul spirit and the cage of every unclean and hateful bird amen i'll tell you what for the believer it's a powerful thing the one that makes this known amen this is a this is a very prophecy out of the book of isaiah the 21st chapter and the ninth verse it and it's beautiful for the believer to know brother branham uses for a text watchman what of the night isaiah chapter 21 that watchmen on the watchtower had the same thing to say in the book of isaiah that this angel in the book of revelations is saying amen babylon is falling it's falling when ezekiel saw her he said she's become foul and unclean and the gods of the earth amen it was full of the whole thing you know what it says she become the habitations of it brother man preaches blasphemous names he preaches broken cisterns he said why is she full of it he said because it's cages that are blasphemous names who are living in broken sisters sisters of the world made man-made systems to attract every unclean loving bird every person that wants to live in filth and sin and ungodliness amen there's a cage built for them this morning it's a religious cage that they built but the prophet said it was going to come now look look at the beauty of this the prophet of god said here's the thing the blasphemous names see a power has written a name on the church amen it's a blasphemous name what they've done is they've taken a crowbird and they put some dove feathers and then they call it a dove now that ain't a dove that's a crow with their feathers and that's what the world has done they take a sin uh person put them in the church and say that's a real believer the prophet of god said see it's a blasphemous names and what is happening is now watch the beast power of rome has wrote their name on the people they've written their interpretation of the scripture right in the life of the people how did they do it they took over pulpits they took over schools they took over seminaries and taught the people a religious deception that would fill up these cages oh now think of this because this prophet that sees it he don't say this is just america he said they have drunk of the wife of the wrath for fornication and the kings of the earth have committed fornication and the merchants of the earth and through the abundance of her delicies i heard another voice saying come out over my people and be not partakers of her sin that received not her pledge for her sins have reached unto heaven and god has remembered her iniquity now watch this after this thing i saw this angel come down i love how brother branham says it he said after this thing what is after this thing he said see in revelations 10 the seventh angel's coming and he's an eagle to make all the mysteries known now john is set marveling at this horrible thing he's marveling at her beauty and the angel says to him don't marvel at it john she's full she's drunk with the wine of the saints that has been before you this woman is the killer of the people of god she slayed the word of the lord and and john's marveling at her but the angel amen says don't marvel at her john and reveals her whoredoms he reveals what's behind her come on church the prophet of god said it might look like a pearly gate but behind it is a gate of hell hey man she's painting herself up hey man she's put on a i feel a theological makeup is that right but behind her is the gates of hell what has she done now watch what she's doing she's made this come forth and this angel as he begins to reveal her is the same time the revelations are breaking that reveals all the secrets that's in the bible when those secrets are beginning to be revealed it reveals this church is falling but at the same time he says to another people come out over my people now amen i don't know about y'all some people seem to be ashamed to be called the people of this message but amen in light of this i'm not ashamed at all to hear that come out of her my people isn't it something when he preached marriage and divorce and brought pardon to them that was in trouble amen what he said this is to my congregation this is to those that follow after me look at vacant man's filter this ain't for everybody but for the congregation of israel when he met him in the sixth dimension the bible the angel said to him these are your people oh my the people of god that was called by a message it's the people that's coming out oh my to think of this these faithful and unclean birds you ain't finding no eagles in there they don't say a thing about eagle being there you know why because something's been revealed fresh man has been laid out and the eagles have left the filth behind them and come out for fresh word that they might be now the beauty of this is coming out of her come out now you know there's no other age to go into so this call to come out is a call to come up it's not a call just to come out to another age it's a call to come up to come up into another faith into another atmosphere and not everybody can take the step not everybody can reach the gap from church to bride not everybody can take a step of faith and walk with the word of the hour we're living in but there is a predestinated bride there is a people of god amen that they are anointed for the season to believe the word of the age they're living in well when i think of this this bible said this messenger he said he come with great power and he lighted the earth with his glory you know that word power there you know in bible power is represented by a beast when you when you look in daniel 7 you'll see four beasts back there that daniel sees and he sees the kingdoms of the world divided in four different kingdoms and when he sees that he excelled these as kingdoms they were all gentile kingdoms and those kingdoms when when you look at them it calls them a beast which is an untamed therion it's a it's something can't receive headship but that same beast is seen in revelations 13 but it's all together and o rome resurrects itself now and comes back to the earth and here it is with a false interpretation of the word to bring the power of death right on the people now watch it death is going to ride his horse that pale is going to ride death and hell is going to follow after it disbelief of the word it's going to bring hell it's going to bring death it's going to bring filthiness and uncleanliness but there's a bride that's fallen another power the power she's following it's an eagle power oh brother let me tell you this the power that god's got is not just for heaven it's for the church the bible said and it was lighted with his glory the earth was lighted you ever study there where brother braham talks about the four anointings he calls them powers he calls them powers he says they call them beasts he said but there's a better word living creature revelation chapter four a living creature he said watch the number of them there's four of them man lion oxen eagle now those four anointings he said the number has relevance to us it's an earthly number amen he said watch four days lazarus was raised watch how jesus and the son of man was the fourth man in the fire he said four represents earth deliverance on the earth that's why the first time they come up what are they doing they're protecting the garden of eden the tree of life is there they're protecting the garden eating next time you see them in the scripture what are they doing they're protecting the word among israel got two million people and they're all camped out and got squadrons they got three camps in the north they got three camps in the east three camps in the south three camps in the west and they're all camping under banners lion ox man eagle what are they doing they're all protecting one thing there's a tent out in the middle of it and there's a banner over that tent but it's a pillar of fire banner amen and inside the tent is another four creatures the cherubims are sitting on the mercy seat and they're protecting one thing again they're protecting the word that is among the people the place that god's gonna meet with him the cherubims are there at that place oh brother little did we understand when we saw that until matthew mark luke and john come along and when they come along there were four gospels surrounding one book of acts that wasn't the acts of apostles that was the acts of god in the apostles the four anointings was perfecting one thing god acting at his word in the flesh of humankind no wonder it was protecting that tent back there oh i'll tell you this god's anointing is his power his power is a quickening power it's not just a bunch of dead letters on a page it's a quitting power when you see those anointings up through the ages they're protecting something they're not just protecting they're empowering now think about they they they're all warring with these horses coming up through the you all believers so i won't have to explain it but they're all warring coming up to the end and all the time death is getting stronger but life is getting greater two influences are happening babylon begins to fall the power of death has begun to take her the same anointing that anointed the serpent in the garden that his influence caused god to curse the serpent and put him on his belly to never rise again is that right that same anointing has fell on the end time and the churches have fell under it and they're falling they're falling under the influence of confusion and death and ungodliness amen but there's another anointing the one that adam walked away from the one that he walked away from has been loosed out of the blood cell and come back on the church again in the power of the holy ghost not a man to bring the church down but to pull her up to bring her up to another level the power the power of the resurrection see we're receiving the life of christ but it's not just the life it's the resurrected life oh my think of this now coming right into the end no wonder he's calling him out of the church church is falling brides rising two different things are happening at the same time why is it happening because see sin and ungodliness has brought a fall but the word has brought deliverance for the children of god look at the seas that we're living in rising and falling at the same time once being built up in faith while the other is driven down in death and ungodliness why is that church falling they put cursed things in her foundation they put cursed things in her wall amen they put un un uh um how would i say it uh time don't lock me a long time here but i'll say this i used to be an inspector in a city and i would go inspect some bridges and things like that you know what we had to watch we had to watch the steel that went in the concrete and we had to measure the concrete what poundage they put there because them contractors knew that they knew what the specs called for but they had buddies in the companies that got the concrete and the steel and all this stuff and what they do is they'd make a deal behind the scenes and they'd say now the specs call for this so you send this and call it this you you it calls for a number one steel bar to go on the bridge great you know maybe it's costing number one but they'd make a deal so tell you what you do you send number four bar it's it's a dollar and a half bar cheaper and if you're gonna spend a thousand bars and start making some money so he said you send the other bars and just send the manifest to say it's a number one bar we'll give it to the inspector we'll split the money but what goes in the building is not what the spec said it should be unless you know what you're looking at unless you know what you're looking for they then it's put in the building and nobody knows the difference till the thing falls down are you with me and the whole world thinks the church is standing they think it's in power but when the great shaking begins which we've already begun to arrive even at the same time when she starts falling the church has already been mourned come out of her because she's gonna fall down now they had sense enough to listen no different than that bunch of cattle and birds and everything else over in india when the earthquake started coming they got away from the walls brother because they knew the things that's gonna fall down that's why the church got away from systems of organization man-made ideas of the word they got away from it because god's instrument of divine intelligence has told them to come come right out of this thing see the church has fallen down but the bride she's rising up she's coming up higher than she's ever been before what's god doing he's building her up he's building her up upon divine revelation building her up on divine revelation now i want you to think of this this ain't much different brother i'm spreading spiritual food and due season it's not much different than elijah's day something happened in elijah's day ahab married jezebel and jezebel bewitched the country into evil things and what her greatest sin was they worshipped other gods and when they started worshiping other gods god sent a man who wasn't tied to none of them he wasn't tied to none of their systems or their ideas he comes stepping out of the wilderness and had divine authority he come stood right before ahead and said is god liveth i'm his servant and they ain't even ring on false i ask it to come well who do you think you are i'll tell you who he was he was god's servant and he was there to proclaim the god you quit serving still alive just because israel didn't serve him anymore didn't mean he wasn't still god and god was going to show him through judgment the same way he showed them through mercy i'm still a living god and look at what he done he dried up the heavens and elijah goes down the brook chair for a while but the rain still didn't come so drought settled on the whole country of israel and if you follow luke chapter four you'll find in the next few verses from where i read jesus begins to refer to this and he said listen now it was an elijah's time when a drought come he said there were many widows in israel why was it elijah went out to the widow of xeropath who was down at zion amen there's a lot of people in israel but that elijah anointing left israel and went to a little widow woman who was a gentile who had a child that was perishing among church she without a vision she was going to perish but there was no prophet's promise to her but god showed a symbol that he knew what he was hiding from other men and sent elijah to a gentile woman oh hallelujah and you're glad elijah went to her what a symbol that was in the bible that god hid from the theologian but he knew by foreknowledge he was laying out a plan i'm going to go to a little woman who's a gentile woman wow while israel is over there and this other thing i'm gonna go minister to her when he found her she was out getting her last bit of meal she ran out of food brother she yeah things would have gotten bad shape and when he walked over to her and asked her what she was doing she began to tell him he said well i'll tell you what you do go get me a drink he said why are you in there fix me kate and bring it to me and that little sister god bless her heart she said you know what preacher i ain't got a cake i just got a morsel he said bring it to me then hey man i'll tell you what she didn't have much left brother crow but the elijah demanded all she had he demanded the last morsel she had amen to give up every bit of i hope you're listening to me i'm not talking about something back there i'm talking about today we got these little ideas left around we got these understandings that's laying around oh but brother if elijah's going to give something to this church they got to give every bit of it up they got to say hey that's the lord liveth i got one morsel but i'm going to give it away i'm going to turn it all over this morning when she turned that over you know what happened to her she heard atomic words thus saith the lord your meal barrel will never go dry and you're cursive oil and never go down look at what he began to do and she began the bible says by the word of the lord that came through elijah she began to live on it it was a sustaining food it was a sustaining life in the middle of judgments in the middle of the greatest drought and the great wickedness of the age she was sustained because she met elijah hallelujah that's coming today church and it already is now that the world is going to take the food away from the children of god and and give them humble pie the witches had to hold up gonna give them poison food some witch is doctored up somewhere and they'll call it an apple or a humble pie or whatever they want to call it but it'll be indoctrinated with doctrines of devils but god has a church that don't have to eat it because they got a food that's been hidden they don't have to eat it don't have to worry about it can you can you imagine can you imagine this little woman in here a few days later and her son dies by some other cause and she goes in there and says elijah what happened i was good to you and it seems like god has brought memory to my sin now the bible says that's what happens to babylon that god remembers her seeing he takes the covers off of her and he brings judgment on she knows this elijah is bringing judgment and it seems as though this judgment's fell on her home and she says what's the matter elijah he said wait a minute and he shows the restoration doesn't he he takes that little boy and lays him in there on the bed of the prophet and lays right over and begins to sneeze seven times and breath becomes back into his body amen and when he brings forth the child and says see it still lives it's been revived from the dead this will be good for you and your children believe me amen and and watch what happens now maybe she goes out that morning brother homer and somebody stand out on the fence out there and she can hear the people talking out there well someday god's gonna do something great in our country someday god's gonna do some great things among us and i'll tell you one day it's gonna come some cloud of rain somewhere that god god's gonna have to do something someday to bring revival you know and can you imagine that little woman over her arm about knee deep over in a mill barrel with her hand full of meal that was completely supernatural food and there she sat without in her hand and they was over saying one of these days god's going to i'll tell you this she took that mill barrel out there and said i've already got my revival amen i'm in the middle of a great revival oh i'll tell you this people are waiting on god to do something but this blind knows god has done something you know why they can't get nothing because they won't give everything over they got to keep a hold of their ideas and systems of man but that's what caused the whole church to fall was contaminated ideas of man when she gave everything what's the power she found right in that same bucket brother said that hidden man was christ that hidden man was christ and she reached in there and got a handful of christ every morning you know what happens when you open up spiritual food and due season today i'm on the property god said i thought these seals and thunders was something that was going to come later that was written on the backside of the book he said oh no he showed me the other day these were lost things that were already written but they were just hidden from man but when god began to reveal them they're no longer hidden they're food for the believer that's hearing the words of elijah yeah and the hours she's living in look at this i'm closing look at this look at this power she lived on daily feasted daily on power the power she made steps by coming out of that mill burrow the power that her little boy played out in the yard come out of that mill barrel her revival brought power to her the world didn't know nothing about it was hidden away that same hidden man it was what moses put it back there in the intervale he put it in the holy of holies it was the same manner that fell for moses hundreds of years later a young priest come to maturity they'd take him behind the veil and they'd give him a taste of that original manna and he could come out of there and his mouth would be a witness our god lives he's the same that was there he's still the same today but he's the same in behind the veil now think of this because the same thing that peter and paul had way back here they had it they had that manner they had the original word they had the original blood they had the original way of god but then jesus said unto them yet a little while the world gonna see me no more he said but i will be with you as i will be in you and the prophet of god said see there he's hidden manna today steel he's hidden from the world but he's our power our quickening power look at the bible it said they'll they'll have a form of godliness but they'll deny the power thereof oh we thought that was this power to speak in tongues and see visions the prophet of god said the power thereof vindicated word resurrection power what is jesus the word made manifest in the hour you're living here what did they kick out in revelations 3 jesus was on the outside of the church it was the revealed word that they put out of the church and they invited man's ideas in but i love that little person that he put there for you and me he said but if any man will come unto me i'll come into him and i will sup with him brother man said see he'll reveal all these secret things to you friends because we got elijah because we got the ministry of the hour god has given a revival to this church quickening power what happened on mount sunset probably god says it's not the intelligence of a man he said it was the quickening power of god coming back to the church dynamics has hit the mechanics the power of the word has strengthened the believers now we're living you love him won't you stand your feet with us there's a power hey man these musicians come you know the prophet said one day he was standing he was standing out next to a garage he'd seen a man pull up and he had a car all the mechanics was there he said but it just wasn't running and he asked the mechanic over there to fix it for him he's in a hurry and that pressure got on him get this thing fixed and he couldn't get it and some feller stand over beside a minute walked over and said let me help you fix it he said you know what's wrong with it they just ain't no current in it and the old boy tweaked this and tweaked that and the car started right up he let all the pressure off the mechanic yes because the one that had built the car showed up on the scene all right i'll tell you what friend brother brandon said what's wrong with our revivals he said this is what's wrong when we let go of every creed in every dogma he said then the dynamics construct the mechanics for the going away of the church you love him god bless you brother homer appreciate the word of the lord amen amen just yesterday friday and listen to that amen spiritual food new season you know what i thought about it what a rich message amen you know amen our god reigns all right amen how many believe he reigns tonight he's a reigning god today amen amen
