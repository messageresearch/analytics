========================================
bless you um we're going to go ahead and go real quick let's pray our heavenly father we just thank you Lord for your blessings father thank you that you gave us another day another day of life good health and strength Lord and we just want to give our lives back to you Lord this morning we pray Lord that you would have your way Lord God this this morning and help us to receive something that would benefit your people Grant it Lord Jesus we ask these things in Jesus Christ's name amen praise the Lord being that tomorrow's Memorial Day I wanted to speak this morning about living memorials I know that kind of sounds like an oxymoron a little bit cuz a memorial is is is you're remembering somebody that has passed away uh but there are memorials I believe that of people that have gone on that are still affecting our lives today Jesus Christ being one of them right he's not he's not dead but but so we just wanted we wanted to to to to to talk about about that because we want our lives to end up being a living Memorial right that what you do or what you say or or or is still affecting people even though you are gone and um and so we we want to talk about that what God considers worthy of of remembrance amen and we want to turn to the scripture or you can read here but it's in Matthew 26 6-13 and that to me I consider this Jesus even considered this a living Memorial in verse 6 it says now when Jesus was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper there came unto him a woman having an alabaster box a very precious ointment and poured it on his head as he sat at meat now there are four different instances in the scriptures where women came and anointed Jesus two of them on on on his feet uh two times on on on on his head this case it was ano anointing on o over his head and it says here but when his disciples saw it they had indignation saying to what purpose is this waste so to them it was a waste a waste of time or a waste of money because that alabaster box or and even the the the container that it was in it was very very expensive and and they say here that for this oint might have been sold for much and given to the poor it was considered what she had poured over Jesus's head consider one year's wages for the people back then but she considered it worthy to pour that take it no matter how much it cost and pour it over Jesus's head why I believe there was a revelation there amen she did something out spontaneous out of Revelation and and and and and she didn't see it as a waste for her amen and then when Jesus understood it it uh understood it he said unto them why trouble ye the woman in other words why bother her for she hath wrough a good work upon me for ye have the poor always with you but me ye have not always for in that she hath poured this ointment on my body she did it for my burial in other words like as a as a preparing him for his burial verily I say unto you I don't know if you can see that down here or not verily I say unto you wheresoever this gospel wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world even in Lula Georgia we're talking about it right now right right that's right it's we're fulfilling what Jesus said right here amen wherever soever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world there shall also this that this woman hath done be be told for a memorial of her amen he wasn't saying a memorial of him or a memorial of Memorial of her because she did something spontaneous out of Revelation and it wasn't something contrived and it wasn't something thought about it was as far as uh well if I do this maybe I can get this out of it or no it was something spontaneous that she did Jesus saw that Jesus knew that and therefore he he uh considered it as what she did to be wherever this gospel goes this this thing that she did is going is is going to be talked about throughout the whole world and I'm sure it has already wherever this gospel has gone so um it was going to be a memorial of her amen so what what is a memorial a memorial is something that keeps remembrance alive such as a monument a speech a ceremony or an act that commemorates it's a token of remembrance it's not just a day to shoot fireworks and drink beer and have cookouts man but you know I'm not from this country I'm originally from Columbia South America I have allegiance to my own country as well however I am a United States citizen and and and I respect what the people and the man who fought for this country um probably a lot a lot more than what you'd think and and and even though I am not from this country I I I I I know that man fought what whatever the reasons were for the wars or whatever it was but they fought for a good purpose and so um we it's nice to have a memorial for those men that gave their lives so a Memorial Day is for those that gave is for those that were in armor forces and that gave their life serving while Veterans Day is we we we we honor those that are still even yet alive so there's the difference between the two and so I I respect those men and I know that there's men that have gone on um uh already that were Believers and uh and so we just respect that but it's a token of remembrance and that's what a memorial is it's something that keeps remembrance alive so this woman what she did what she did it was something that was going to keep her remembrance alive you see so that's what a living Memorial is amen we can learn and we can dissect that uh uh of what she did into very minute pieces and and and get different lessons from there but we don't have time right now but you can go back and read it yourself and so but the the main point was to remember what she did for the Lord amen praise God and of course Memorial Day originally known as Decoration Day is a Federal holiday in the United States for honoring and mourning the US military personnel who died while serving in the United States armed forces now here's another Memorial that the scripture talks about and it's in Joshua Joshua 4:5 it says and Joshua said unto them pass over before the Ark of the Lord your God into the M Jordan and take ye up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder according ing unto the number of the tribes of the children of of Israel and this is the Lord telling this to Joshua that this may be a sign among you that when your children ask their fathers in time to come saying what mean ye by these Stones then ye shall answer them that the Waters of Jordan were cut off before the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord when it passed over Jordan the Waters of Jordan were cut off and these Stones shall be for a memorial unto the children of Israel forever it's it's this Memorial right here is commem is commemorating the Living God Amen of what he did for them at that time and what he is going to continue doing uh uh for them and what he's continuing to do for us now amen cuz our God isn't dead amen you know our soldiers have gone on and they're not here with us anymore but God Amen he he he died rose again amen and we're living a ser and serving a living God this morning and in verse 23 of that same chapter says for the Lord your God dried up the Waters of Jordan from before you until ye were passed over as the Lord your God did to the Red Sea which he dried up from before us until we were gone over and this is the purpose that God had for this that all the people of the earth not just for the Jews that all the people of the earth might know the hand of the Lord that it is mighty not that it was so you know we just look at what God did in the past it was so great that's wonderful but that it is mighty what he did for them amen he can do for you he can part your your problem apart amen dissect the thing amen and you cross through Amen on dry ground amen amen right that it is mighty that ye and this is the purpose that ye might fear the lord your God forever I don't know if you can see that or not but that that is that is the purpose amen that God allowed for the children of Israel to put these 12 Stones and stack them on top of one another when they were getting ready to take the promised land amen and so it reminded me of of Matthew 25:35 and if and you go back and and and and listen to brother brandom's uh message time tested memorials it's a short message but it's packed very very powerfully packed and this is the scripture he us his opening scripture Matthew 25:35 Heaven and Earth shall pass away this is Jesus speaking but my words shall not pass away amen praise God and so we see that that at some point Heaven and Earth uh Peter talks about it that heaven and earth and the elements thereof are going to melt with fervent heat amen the the the the the elements of this Earth will be destroyed amen and and and and and and God will create a new Heaven and and a new Earth amen but his word amen whenever you you take his word and you put it into action and it becomes a revelation to you and put it into action amen that is something that can stand as a living Memorial right and that if if if affected somebody in a positive way right they'll always remember that amen they'll always remember that I I've always said that when you give a gift to someone amen when you give them that gift that and you look at that gift that gift is not to for them to look at it and it remind them of themselves or remind them of somebody else no every time I look at that gift that that someone gave me it reminds me of The Giver right it reminds me of the person that gave amen and so that's what that's what happens when you give amen that woman that anointed Jesus amen what is it what does it remind us whenever we read about it reminds us of her we don't even know her name right there's other instances where we know it was Mary the the that the uh uh Lazarus brother uh that and that and John is giving her name and we'll read about it we read about it here in a moment but to to that specific woman that anointed her head we don't even know what her name is we just know it was in Bethany and yet we still remember her and he said Jesus said that wherever this gospel goes this W this that this woman told will be will be will be remembered and so God's creative word is still standing and it's still creating amen how many how many believe that that when God said let there be amen that's still resonating like an echo it's still creating I believe amen it's still creating amen life in in in in you and I amen his word Never Dies his word continues on praise the lord it's like an echo amen and it has creative power even thousands of years later after it was spoken amen that's why Jesus could say heaven and Earth shall pass away but my word shall not pass away amen now we do have also negative memorials and brother brandham in that message time tested memorials he talks about a man he didn't remember his name and we'll read the quote here in just a moment but his name was Chester ble and I went and did some research on this guy and he was a hardcore atheist and he was an Infidel and he he would tell you that he was he didn't care about he didn't believe that there was a God he didn't believe that uh uh and and so he had a statue made of himself which is this this is the picture was taken in the early 1900s he wanted that statue to be placed on top of his grave and it's h Standing On Top of the Bible and and and and and and declaring um something there on on on that on that thing he's holding up um and he died in 1908 and he's he's he is uh he is said to have said that if there is a God let snakes run over my grave and according to Legend or according to to what some witnesses have have said and testimonies from different preachers and different people who have visited that site and even what brother brandham said they said that this man's grave that's a it's located in a beautiful Cemetery in a beautiful area but this man's grave has snake holes all over his grave site and snakes constantly walking around garter snakes and black snakes going around so you ask what you what you what you know what you claim you know then he got what what but some people have said that they they had moved uh they ended up having to take that area off because they needed to create a road through there or something like that so they moved his grave up somewhere and somewhere higher uh with other Graves and the Builders of the constructors they said that they didn't see any snakes so it's conflicting testimonies however the thing is is that this man's testimony is a negative testimony that's the point whether there was snakes in his grave or not the point is is that this man's life has a positive Memorial a negative Memorial about him this is what brother brandom said one Memorial that I'd like to refer to now it's in Ohio and there was an Infidel I forget his name I got the picture somewhere there in my collection at home where he was so firmly against Christianity till he wanted a Memorial built to him after his death with his foot on the Bible pointing down like that and saying away with religious superstitions and up with modern science and when he was dying he said if I've been wrong serpents will crawl out of my grave and when he died they were still shoveling the dirt into the grave and they killed two or three big vipers and today in that graveyard a minister taken a picture recently and brought it to show me and hanging over the chains around his lot the graveyard is a beautiful place and I saw that picture picture it's online you can look at it yourself there's snakes hanging hanging from a from like a fence the graveyard is a beautiful place but his Mound is nothing but a snake Mound and no matter even into the Fallen winter serpent still crawl from his grave a memorial and brother BR says God forbid me ever have a memorial like that or any of you so this man he he this is the memorial that he wanted of himself and he got what he wanted right that statue that he made of himself uh you can't see it very well right there I faded it out but that statue that he made of himself it's got It's it it it people would shoot it it's got bullet holes all over it he's it's got even a bullet hole right here in the middle of his forehead and it was so it it was getting to be so damaged because people hated hated that that they ended up taking the statue down and now it's I don't know where it's located but it's not on top of the monument anymore but it's very bad badly torn now compare this Memorial to the memorial that that woman that anointed Jesus head had this is the memorial that this man left what about the compared to that Memorial that that woman that anointed Jesus head so whether whether there was snakes or not at his gravide the point is that the monument that he had made to be erected for his memorial after his death is shrouded with negativity spookiness and disrespect from the public God help us not to have a memorial like that amen other negative memorials that we can look at in in the Bible is Lot's wife and we know that the decision that she made she loved the world too much she loved Sodom and gomorra too much and of course as she she was trying to she was trying to do what the angel was telling her to do trying to leave but something just made her turn back and she turned into a pillar of salt and according to uh what archaeologists have have have uncovered she's still standing as a pillar of salt there today the Tower of Babel amen a project that was started by man amen but the project was halted and and God destroyed it God didn't allow that to continue because it was man-made it was maned it wasn't originated by God or or or or Revelation amen as for example like this woman uh uh uh who went and anointed Jesus uh head amen that was something that's something Eternal amen but the Tower of Babel was something that was it was man-made it was what man was trying to do to get to God Amen and not what God was trying to do into man to for him to come to uh closer to man see that's what religion is religion is what you do to try to get closer to God Amen Christianity is what God has done to try to get closer to us amen praise God and you can look at nebuch as's dream statue amen it's repr represented four kingdoms that Daniel he interpreted but uh when you read that there was a a stone that came down from the top of the mountain and destroyed that thing amen and that stone represented Christ amen all the kingdoms of this Earth all the ideas of this Earth amen all the scientific the so-called discoveries of this Earth will fall they won't go anywhere amen but God's word will remain amen God's word is eternal Amen brother random says in the message super he said the United States a few years ago tried to make a suers ship they made it so they said it would never sink it couldn't be sank God put the Titanic in the bottom of the sea shows that man's achievements will never amount to anything it's all dust and going back to the dust that's what's in him and then in a message be not afraid if it wasn't of God it won't amount to anything we can't say that about the woman that anointed Jesus head right because we're still talking about it here in the small town of Lula Georgia wherever this gospel goes amen that woman's testimony was is going to live and it's going to be spoken of and if it's of God who is going to stop it all right now if that see what is it every plant that my heavenly father hasn't planted will be rooted up amen all right this is the the the the Judas amen um in the same in in here in in in the in John chapter 12 says then Jesus 6 days before the Passover came to Bethany the same place where he was anointed on uh by the woman on her head where Lazarus was which he had been dead whom he had raised from the dead there they made him a supper and Martha served but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him then took Mary which is Martha's sister a pound of ointment of ner very costly it must cost a lot because the Bible says it was very costly and anointed the feet of Jesus so in Bethany this other one he was anointed in the on the head here he's anointed on the feet and wiped his feet with her hair and the house was filled with the odor of the ointment now watch what what what Judas says about this then sayth one of his disciples judas's scariot Simon son son which should betray him now there's one of the things that we recognize and that we know about about about Judas is day we don't think about him how how what the good things he did for the poor or or the things he even did to Jesus amen we think about him as him being the son of predition the one who betrayed Jesus that's his memorial right why was not this ointment this is what he said why was not this ointment sold for 300 p and given to the poor this he said not that he cared for the poor but because he was a thief there's another Memorial of G of of Judas he was a thief and the Bible called him a thief and had the bag and bear what was put there in then said Jesus let her alone against the day of my burying hath she kept this for the poor always ye have with you but me ye have not always amen so judas's actions were memorialized by having but have negative light and no positive lessons right well you can't get anything positive from his actions here in this particular in this particular scripture right so that's his memorial right that's what he left behind and I'm going kind of quickly because I I'm trying to finish this and so here's here's here's these acts of humility by these women man in both instances Jesus was in Bethany that's significant within itself but you can study that on your own uh one woman anointed the head in Matthew 26 Mary anointed the feet in John 12 both Acts were done spontaneously with Revelation and anointing because they wanted to not because somebody told them to or forced them to amen but because they wanted to do it it was something about the life of Jesus that spoke to them that made them want to do this service for for for for Jesus all right that's how we should serve the Lord amen man not because you're forced to or not because uh because somebody will speak against you or or or something like that or because you don't want to go to hell amen it's because you want to do it amen because you you want to serve the Lord and it's in me I have no other there's nothing else I can do but to anoint his head and anoint his feet amen with my life life amen and let my life be a beautiful fragrance to him amen these two women's Acts were accepted by Jesus while while while Judas was rebuked by Jesus these women's Acts were accepted their Acts were properly memorialized and positively talked about today we talk about them in a positive light today don't we amen but we don't talk about Judas in that same way do we why because he left a negative Memorial yeah and I believe these actions they type the bride the second Eve this bride will receive the word of life and she will not doubt it like brother brandham said right they saw life in Jesus and therefore they acted upon that the word of life will put the the bride into action amen she recognizes the word as her head the bride recognizes the word as her head she knows what he wants done with the word she knows that right she only does his will or she keeps still right that's why these women they man when they went to anoint Jesus amen they just knew maybe it wasn't in their place to do that because they were maybe ill famed and they had bad uh uh reputation amongst the people I don't care I'm going in with what I got and Jesus accepted that and that's how God wants you to come amen with uh with with just as you are amen she only does his will or she keeps still the bride knows that it has to be God in her doing the works amen praise God Amen so a few more positive memorials the cross and what Christ did there for us the woman and the two mites right rahab's actions in the Old Testament we talk about those things in positive life Esther's actions right Ruth's actions amen the faith of Abraham we talk about those things those are living memorials that are still bringing life into us today amen they have a lot of types right praise God brother brandom says this and I'm almost done it says he says in time Testament more so we today as the church you're to put on the Rob of Christ the whole armor of Christ the whole shield and Buckler and armor that we might stand blameless at that day he is looking for time tested memorials as he can say there's my servant I've tested him I've tried him I've put him through like job there's another example we don't talk about job in a negative light right his life still speaks to us right he still proves 100% God be merciful to us that we can take God at his word and be time tested memorials amen that we can take God at his word and be time tested memorials not question it not doubt it but take it at take it for who he said it I believe it amen and move on with it praise God so what kind of Memorial are you leaving behind is my question ask another question what do you want people to say about you at your funeral think about that what do you want God to say about you all right I'd want God to say Well done good and faithful servant thou has been Faithful over a few things I will make thee ruler over many things enter thou into the joy of thy Lord you know that that that question what what live your life according to how you want people to preach at your funeral right what will your mom say about you if you passed away what will your daughters say about you what what will your son say about you what what what will your family your friends your co-workers what what would they say about about you live your life that way and you can be a time tested Memorial amen the things you do for yourself are gone when you are gone but the things you do for God and for others remain as your legacy amen and those things there will be time there will be living memorials because they will continue to impact and change lives as they are remembered not just something that's dead or live or sitting there and you know it it causes confusion more than it does life no not the examples we just talked about and I want my example to be that way amen amen God bless you all amen praise the [Applause] Lord just leave this up
