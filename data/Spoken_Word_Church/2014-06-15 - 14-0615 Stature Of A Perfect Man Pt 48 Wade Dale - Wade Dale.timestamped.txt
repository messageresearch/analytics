[0:00] the screen today I thought this morning
[0:01] we'd do
[0:03] something just kind of we're on
[0:05] godliness
[0:07] and take your Bibles and turn to
[0:09] Galatians chapter
[0:12] 5 and Galatians chapter 5 we're going
[0:18] to read Paul's writings this morning and
[0:22] let him kind of
[0:25] explain it's talking about the fruits of
[0:27] the spirit obviously but it also talks
[0:29] about other things also that
[0:33] U that when we get to Godliness that's a
[0:36] that's a beautiful position to be
[0:38] in um that you can act like
[0:43] God so that what that's what godliness
[0:45] is right is to act like
[0:52] God now we still have the human
[0:55] factor that we have to deal with because
[0:58] of the sin curse
[1:00] but now if he made a
[1:02] way if he made a way to get out of it
[1:05] then there's a way to get out of
[1:06] it that is dealing with the flesh
[1:09] there's a way to get out of
[1:11] that because he conquered the flesh when
[1:13] he was here right
[1:16] so and The Same Spirit that's in him
[1:19] within us is in us if we have any
[1:22] bir and just common sense would say it
[1:26] should make exact same way right all
[1:28] right so Galatians chap CH 5 we're going
[1:30] to read the whole
[1:31] chapter but when we get down to the
[1:33] fruits of the spirit
[1:35] we'll talk about that because I believe
[1:38] this kind of sums it all up that you can
[1:40] take each one and parallel them with all
[1:42] the virtues but when you come to
[1:43] Godliness is what I said before when you
[1:46] get to Godliness you got all those
[1:47] virtues working in your life then then
[1:50] there's a lot of things that you should
[1:51] be able to do to
[1:53] overcome at that place so let's go to
[1:56] chapter five Stand Fast therefore in the
[1:58] Liberty where with Christ has made us
[2:01] free now he's talking about the New
[2:03] Birth we come to the New Birth and be
[2:06] not entangled again with the Yoke of
[2:08] bondage don't be entangled again so what
[2:10] can happen you can get
[2:12] entangled you know what he saying don't
[2:14] be entangled again with the Yoke of
[2:16] bondage all
[2:19] right which who puts the Yoke on us we
[2:22] do cuz Christ took it off we put the
[2:25] burdens back on right right behold I
[2:29] Paul say unto you that if you be
[2:32] circumcised Christ shall profit you
[2:36] nothing boy he was telling them plain
[2:38] wasn't he I mean he he he's talking to
[2:40] the
[2:41] Galatians he's telling them said your
[2:43] circumcision is nothing
[2:45] now it's a circumcision of the heart not
[2:48] a circumcision of the flesh right but
[2:50] there was a time when we come up to the
[2:52] circumcision of the flesh which was a
[2:55] type and that's it un new birth that's
[2:56] the baby form when Abraham was
[2:58] circumcised that type the Holy Ghost in
[3:01] its baby form everybody got that right
[3:03] all right but we have to be circumcised
[3:09] again have to be circumcised again cuz
[3:11] it's it's a refilling of the Holy Ghost
[3:13] it's not you get the Holy Ghost like you
[3:14] did at the baby
[3:17] form right it's a refilling it's a
[3:19] packing on of more because really
[3:23] actually I was I was listening the other
[3:25] day on a radio and there was a doctor on
[3:28] there and he said he you know your
[3:30] largest organ in your body you know what
[3:32] the largest organ in your body is
[3:33] organism in your body is skin your skin
[3:37] right your flesh your flesh is the
[3:39] largest organism in your body it covers
[3:42] Almost 100% besides all them little
[3:45] places that there's not flesh there you
[3:46] know you understand what I'm talking
[3:47] about so Paul understood that that great
[3:51] you know the greatest organ was going to
[3:53] have to be circumcised not totally
[3:54] circumcised like Abraham did with the
[3:57] foreskin of his of his manhood but but
[3:59] it's the foreskin of our flesh it's the
[4:01] it's the added stuff that we have that
[4:04] we have to shave off that's why the
[4:06] statue of perfect man is a shaving off
[4:09] of excess flesh and it's not excess
[4:12] flesh we can't do
[4:13] anything you know you could lose 100 lb
[4:16] but you you still a center if you were a
[4:19] center you know whatever so it's not
[4:22] that it's it's working on the inside but
[4:25] it truly is showing on this one if this
[4:28] is your largest organ your larest
[4:30] facility to display
[4:33] Humanity this is what has got to be
[4:35] under control all right watch what he
[4:38] says for I testify again to every man
[4:41] that is circumcised that he is a debtor
[4:44] to do the whole law
[4:46] right now do you understand what he's
[4:48] saying there not see a lot of people say
[4:50] well I'm just going to go to the priest
[4:52] and let him cut the four skin of my
[4:54] manhood off and I'm well sure that made
[4:56] you a Jew and that gave you right to go
[4:58] in the temple because you were
[5:00] circumcised but that was just an outward
[5:02] showing that's why there was no holy
[5:04] ghost in the Old Testament to get inside
[5:07] the person it was just a fleshly looking
[5:10] at the person you know but here we see
[5:12] Paul has brought us into the into the
[5:16] light
[5:17] of of the whole law in other words what
[5:20] you know what he was seeing he was
[5:22] seeing people go and have the
[5:24] circumcision done and then living like
[5:26] the
[5:27] devil that's what he was seeing right
[5:29] here cuz he says not try testify again
[5:32] to every man that is circumcised that he
[5:34] is a Deb to do the whole law not just
[5:36] that one type of circumcision right so
[5:38] so we're and let me explain this a
[5:41] little bit
[5:42] quicker our foreskins taking off at a
[5:46] new birth all right that's the type but
[5:48] then here we got to be a debor of the
[5:50] whole law we say well we're not under
[5:52] the law no we're not but you can't do
[5:55] away with the Old Testament types and
[5:56] shadows which brings us into the new
[5:58] testament which brings that statute of a
[6:00] perfect man
[6:01] alive in Jesus Christ and in now in me
[6:04] and you so the ones before that I don't
[6:08] say they have an excuse but they do have
[6:10] an excuse God couldn't get in their soul
[6:12] to make them act like him but there was
[6:15] anointing that would come down and and
[6:17] anoint the
[6:19] person David right and he would write
[6:21] those songs as we're talking about but
[6:24] when that anointing was off David he was
[6:26] a a lustful king sorry he was a lustful
[6:29] King m i mean man he had 500
[6:33] wives he had 500 wives but he want he he
[6:36] watched one on the rooftop naked and got
[6:38] all excited let me just just I mean and
[6:40] said I want her knowing she was married
[6:44] cuz you I was his best
[6:45] friend now see that wasn't the holy
[6:47] ghost that was that was this flesh that
[6:50] Paul St F talk about right that was the
[6:52] flesh he's fixing to talk about now I'm
[6:55] sure David was
[6:57] circumcised right I'm sure don't you
[7:00] think so he had the right of
[7:01] circumcision he was under the law he was
[7:03] under the the right of being a Jew or an
[7:07] Israelite but he didn't do the whole
[7:11] law but remember he was covered by
[7:13] grapes by Prophet being them
[7:17] right it's not for Grace then we're all
[7:20] you can be circumcised you
[7:23] you you can take a grinder and grind
[7:26] your flesh off and you still just as bad
[7:28] as you you know
[7:29] that's right right that's right all
[7:33] that people today back then they said
[7:36] I'm circumcised so I got to be God today
[7:39] I'm in the got right but do you do the
[7:42] whole law all 1100 sermon do we do what
[7:47] the prophet said
[7:50] right Christ is become of no effect unto
[7:55] you whosoever of you are justified by
[7:58] the law
[8:00] the law can't justify anybody so that's
[8:03] why I'm telling you about this virtue
[8:05] not all that is not dos and don'ts right
[8:08] there's not a do and a don't in that
[8:11] that's right but it's all dos and don'ts
[8:13] it's what you do and what you don't do
[8:15] but remember what Paul's trying to tell
[8:17] the Galatians he's like Mom said he's
[8:19] looking at them and saying okay you're
[8:20] circumcised you can go into the
[8:23] temple you you can show me in other
[8:26] words I can show you I've been
[8:26] circumcised that was an outward
[8:28] expression that they had become a Jew
[8:31] but then you look at them and see him
[8:33] committing adultery you see them doing
[8:35] this you see him doing that you see him
[8:36] doing all these other things and Paul's
[8:38] going Christ has become of no effect
[8:41] unto
[8:43] you what he's trying to do is get them
[8:45] converted remember he said old fish
[8:46] Galatians he he went to the Galatians
[8:48] and and they uh still worshiping idols
[8:51] and stuff like that
[8:54] right ye are fallen from
[8:58] Grace so Paul was bringing Grace to him
[9:00] they thought Paul was bringing a
[9:02] judgment to him Paul was not he was
[9:03] trying he was trying to give him a way
[9:05] out he really was he was trying to say
[9:07] look you continue like you
[9:10] are you're going to have to stand in
[9:12] judgment under the wall and none of you
[9:16] are going to make it cuz it says right
[9:18] here it says you're fallen from grace
[9:19] for we through the
[9:22] spirit wait for the hope of
[9:24] righteousness by faith all right for in
[9:27] Jesus Christ neither circumcision ath
[9:31] anything nor uncircumcision but Faith
[9:35] which worketh by
[9:37] love you did run well who did hinder you
[9:40] that you should not obey the
[9:43] truth this persuasion cometh not of him
[9:46] that calleth you a little leaven leth
[9:50] the whole
[9:51] lung put a little bit of Leaven it don't
[9:53] matter if you put it in a 55 gallon drum
[9:55] of unleavened bread it's going to work
[9:57] and work and work work and work and what
[10:00] it does is it goes from uh it's like
[10:02] yeast it multiplies from one cell to two
[10:04] 2 to 4 4 to 8 8 to 16 16 to 32 so it's
[10:09] not just it's adding one it it's
[10:11] exponentially it's doubling that's right
[10:13] that's why the someone says sin will
[10:15] take you father than you want to go you
[10:17] know once you get out
[10:19] there I have confidence in you through
[10:21] the Lord that you will be none otherwise
[10:24] minded but he that troubleth you shall
[10:27] bear his judgment who soever he be and I
[10:30] Brethren if I yet preach circumcision
[10:33] why do I yet suffer persecution remember
[10:35] he suffered persecution he wasn't s
[10:38] suffering persecution because he was
[10:39] circumcised cuz he could show him he was
[10:41] a Jew he was circumcised they were
[10:44] persecuting him by what he was
[10:46] preaching right he was tearing up their
[10:49] synagogues not physically but
[10:54] spiritually why do I yet suffer
[10:56] persecution then is the offense of the
[10:57] Cross ceased then is the offense of the
[11:00] Cross seed I would they were even cut
[11:03] off which trouble you for Brethren you
[11:06] have been called under
[11:08] Liberty only use not Liberty for an
[11:11] occasion to the
[11:14] flesh but by love serveth one another in
[11:17] other words don't do it because you say
[11:20] well I'm I'm coming to brotherly
[11:21] kindness I've got to start loving yeah
[11:24] you do yes you do have to start loving
[11:27] your
[11:27] brother but if you go well well I got to
[11:30] shake that sister's hand and smile at
[11:32] her just so they'll think I got
[11:33] brotherly kindness no they don't work
[11:36] right
[11:38] no that's why brotherly kindness we're
[11:40] going to get into a few things and it's
[11:42] going to I mean it's one of them where
[11:43] it's right here in your face it's right
[11:45] here it's just you and you
[11:48] alone cuz you can love somebody and
[11:50] shake their hand hug their neck
[11:52] and think to be friends with them and
[11:55] then they hate you in their heart and
[11:58] not that they hate you as you say well I
[12:01] hate you know whatever I you know I
[12:05] don't try not to hate things but I
[12:07] despise doing things it's not that you
[12:09] can't do that you got to bring that
[12:11] thing together cuz Jesus said the
[12:13] greatest commandment is love your
[12:14] neighbor as you love yourself now how
[12:16] many you had trouble with your
[12:18] neighbor well you got to love him and
[12:21] her just as much as you love yourself
[12:23] and everybody go do the will of the
[12:26] Lord we'll get to the more in a minute
[12:28] we got to do it the same
[12:31] okay but you know what that that works
[12:34] because when I was in New York and you
[12:36] said well I'm going to Che on I'm going
[12:38] to be kind I'm going do and I'm going
[12:39] smile and everything I used to sit in my
[12:42] manager's space and be smiling and
[12:45] smiling and smiling and smiling and I
[12:48] come home and I C myself I said you know
[12:50] God I did good the Holy Spirit wait this
[12:53] is good I was I was doing the FL and uh
[12:57] and you said you need your in Li the
[13:00] Holy Spirit bring to your attention is
[13:02] that you tell another a whole lot of
[13:04] lies smile his face tell a whole lot of
[13:09] lies he comes out and he he shows you
[13:12] brother talking about you showing it and
[13:15] he look at you and my manager even said
[13:17] oh John is so nice he I had it going
[13:22] on you a do didn't you there's one you
[13:26] can't
[13:27] do you can't can't do the Lord he's
[13:30] right there he knew it before the
[13:32] foundation of the world anyway for
[13:34] Brethren you have been called under
[13:36] Liberty only use not Liberty for an
[13:38] occasion to the
[13:40] flesh but by love serveth one another
[13:44] for all the law is fulfilled in one word
[13:47] even this Thou shalt love thy
[13:50] neighbor as
[13:56] thyself but if you bite and devour one
[14:01] another take heed that you be not
[14:03] consumed one of
[14:05] another how many times you have listen
[14:08] we've all hated people that's done
[14:11] something to us or whatever and it just
[14:13] eats you alive you know what that ain't
[14:15] going to do you want any good you have
[14:17] wasted part of your life on somebody
[14:19] that don't give a flip about you that's
[14:21] right you wasted your time on it just
[14:23] don't don't worry about that's why why
[14:25] it's going to be tough when we get to
[14:26] brotherly kindness you know the old
[14:29] saying is that uh you know you walk
[14:31] around and you walk in a room and
[14:32] people's over there talking you know you
[14:34] think they're talking about you 90% of
[14:37] the time they ain't talking about you
[14:38] they're talking about their own problem
[14:40] right you know so that's what we got
[14:42] to and you know what it is an Alcoholics
[14:45] Anonymous to start with we've got to
[14:47] turn away from that to begin with and
[14:50] then God who was it the other day said
[14:53] they was doing something and like sister
[14:55] Johnny You' be going through life and
[14:57] you say well God I know I got got this
[14:59] road rage or whatever you know I got
[15:01] this thing that Satan just keep pushing
[15:03] my button well one day he's going to
[15:05] push that
[15:07] button and there's not going to be any
[15:09] life behind it or no spark behind it and
[15:11] you're going to go
[15:15] man that's gone that's done it's done
[15:19] away with but you know what you could
[15:22] sit there all day and go I know it's
[15:24] there but I'm going to still do it I
[15:25] know it's there but I'm going to still
[15:26] do it I know it's there see you can do
[15:27] that and you can override
[15:29] your free moral agency like we talking
[15:31] about last Sunday with the Holy Ghost
[15:32] you can override and the Holy Ghost says
[15:33] go this way and you go that way
[15:37] right we got going get
[15:40] finished yeah we will for all the law is
[15:43] fulfilled in one word all the law Thou
[15:45] shalt love thy
[15:46] neighbor as thyself but if you bite and
[15:49] devour one another take heed that you be
[15:51] not consumed one of another in other
[15:53] words so that's what I'm saying it's
[15:54] going to consume you it's going to hurt
[15:56] your Christian experience now how in the
[15:58] world world are you going to hurt that
[15:59] person's Christian experience if
[16:02] he's right if he don't have one if he
[16:04] don't have a Christian experience and
[16:06] you're over here n n n well who you
[16:09] hurting you ain't hurting him or her you
[16:11] hurt yourself all right that's something
[16:13] you got to get rid
[16:18] of this I say unto thee walk in the
[16:21] spirit and ye shall not fulfill the lust
[16:24] of the
[16:25] flesh now there's your promise right
[16:27] there you can Circle that one and
[16:28] underline it cuz that's yours I I had
[16:30] circled it but I underline it twice for
[16:33] the flesh lust is against the spirit and
[16:36] the spirit against the Flesh and they
[16:39] are contrary to one to the other now you
[16:41] got to realize that see we have to come
[16:42] to realization is is that that's why I
[16:46] believe this church is different from
[16:47] other churches a lot of other churches
[16:48] try to sugarcoat it and say well it's
[16:50] you know you got to just be be nice no
[16:52] we know we got problems in the flesh
[16:55] right right here that tells us there's
[16:57] no allevi
[16:59] of the problems of the flesh there's no
[17:02] way that that that that brother brandom
[17:04] or God even Jesus said well you're never
[17:07] going to have any trouble in the flesh
[17:09] anymore no it's never in the Bible
[17:11] nowhere the only place you're never
[17:12] going to have trouble with flesh is
[17:14] after the body change and I said after
[17:16] the body change I didn't say during it I
[17:18] said after it cuz brother R said right
[17:21] till the moment you're changeed you're
[17:22] going to be sticky your flesh is going
[17:25] to bother you right up to the moment of
[17:27] the change so there's no
[17:29] belief except through the spirit or
[17:31] through Jesus Christ walk in the spirit
[17:33] and you shall not fulfill the lust of
[17:35] the flesh for if the flesh lusted
[17:37] against the spirit and the spirit
[17:38] against the
[17:39] Flesh and these are contrary one to the
[17:41] other so that you cannot do the things
[17:44] that you would that's the statute of a
[17:46] perfect man because the Holy Ghost has
[17:48] all those virtues already packed in
[17:50] there when you get born again now what
[17:51] is our problem we do this right here we
[17:56] let the flesh not the not the listen
[18:00] when when it's talking about flesh it is
[18:02] talking about this but it's the fleshly
[18:05] things we
[18:06] do okay right because remember C taste
[18:09] feel smelling
[18:10] here there's no there's no uh life to
[18:15] that right you understand what I'm
[18:17] saying there's no life to seed taste
[18:19] feel smelling here cuz I still got the
[18:21] same seed taste feel smelling here when
[18:23] I wasn't born again as I do when I'm
[18:25] born again okay you know and remember
[18:28] when brother Brown went across a curtain
[18:29] of town they still had SE taste fil
[18:31] smelling here in their theophany right
[18:35] so so caste Phil smelling here you can't
[18:38] blame you cannot blame anything on caste
[18:41] fi smelling here
[18:45] right
[18:47] sure
[18:50] right
[18:52] so what are we doing it's got to be the
[18:55] next
[18:56] man memory reason CU like you brought
[18:59] out Wednesday night that's good I got a
[19:00] sermon on that I think I've been
[19:02] thinking on I've been thinking been
[19:04] thinking on it been thinking on it we'll
[19:07] say cuz really it is the spirit it now
[19:10] memory is a
[19:12] motivator right because what you saw you
[19:17] have memory of that's
[19:19] right so that's the seeing part but it
[19:22] wasn't that your eyes are going to
[19:24] memorize your eyes are just what you see
[19:26] it with your brain is where the memory
[19:29] part is your reasoning is in your brain
[19:32] your Consciousness yeah it is in your
[19:34] brain too because you have subconscious
[19:36] and Consciousness it's in your brain
[19:37] what brother brand said so all that's in
[19:40] your
[19:40] brain greatest battle ever fults what I
[19:43] was thinking about other night cuz
[19:46] memory reason conscious affection where
[19:48] does it come from your body just
[19:50] displays what you already know or what's
[19:54] chemically in your
[19:55] brain testosterone or whatever you want
[19:58] to call it m that excites you and then
[20:00] the flesh is connected to that and it
[20:02] happened memory reason conscious
[20:05] affection and Imagination for sure is in
[20:07] your brain right so it's all there in
[20:09] your brain it's all in the psyche of you
[20:12] is right there between your ears so it's
[20:14] not we can't blame on stuff well I saw
[20:17] this
[20:18] well no you look that way with your eyes
[20:21] but in your brain that's right in your
[20:25] brain is
[20:26] what motivate
[20:29] what you're looking at right okay so be
[20:32] careful with that middle man memory
[20:35] reason conscious
[20:36] affection imagination all right so let's
[20:39] watch because remember when it talks
[20:42] about Godly love it's not that affection
[20:45] that's in that middle
[20:46] realm the center realm is either Faith
[20:50] or doubt so you either got love or not
[20:53] love and that emulates out through the
[20:57] memory reason ious effects and
[20:59] Imagination it's like I've always said
[21:01] if God's in your soul the devil can play
[21:04] all around it that's right but he's
[21:07] coming from this way so he's got to come
[21:09] down through your contact of the world
[21:13] into your memory reason conscious
[21:15] affection well God's going to do the
[21:16] same thing he's pushing
[21:18] out sure there's no way you can
[21:21] physically forget the things you've done
[21:23] that's right cuz the devil is reminding
[21:26] you of everything you ever
[21:29] done now God's not reminding you of that
[21:31] now he may bring things to your
[21:33] remembrance so you can help others you
[21:35] understand what I'm saying to help
[21:36] others through a situation but he's not
[21:39] going to bring something that you did 20
[21:41] years ago when you wasn't a Christian
[21:42] he's not going to bring that up you know
[21:44] why he can't remember
[21:48] it we got to realize that that's what
[21:51] that scripture means that he has put it
[21:53] in the sea of God's forgetfulness
[21:54] forgetfulness never to be remembered
[21:57] again
[21:58] but the devil see that's the Paradox the
[22:00] devil remembers it brings it to your
[22:02] brain God don't remember it and he's
[22:04] down here going this
[22:07] way and but you have to live off that
[22:09] experience that you have and that's what
[22:11] this statute of a perfect man to me is
[22:13] an experience right and it's an
[22:15] experience that only a very small group
[22:17] of people ever went through First Church
[22:19] age they had it second Church age they
[22:21] had a little bit less Third Church age a
[22:23] little bit less fourth Church age it was
[22:25] gone seed went the ground right
[22:28] fourth Church age they just had faith
[22:30] and that's what got them through they
[22:31] said Jesus Christ is the Son of God and
[22:33] he's my savior and they killed him and
[22:35] that's all they had then you had Luther
[22:37] come out Wesley come out Pentecostals
[22:39] came out but here in the end time that's
[22:42] why the prophet had to come to bring all
[22:43] this together so we can restore back
[22:45] that faith that they had where Peter
[22:47] could say Silver and Gold Have I None
[22:50] but such as I have give I unto thee he
[22:52] had to have it to give it that's right
[22:55] he had to have it to give it and he
[22:56] didn't go ask his pastor about
[22:59] either we need a pastor
[23:01] bad but what about one day when you're
[23:03] out by yourself and you can't find your
[23:07] pastor better call Pastor Jesus that's
[23:09] right make sure you got a line open
[23:11] there somewhere
[23:15] okay but if you be led Verse 18 but if
[23:19] you be led of the spirit ye are not
[23:22] under the
[23:23] law all right now the works of the flesh
[23:26] are manifest
[23:29] which are these adultery fornication
[23:32] uncleanness lasciviousness idolatry
[23:35] witchcraft hatred variance emulations
[23:38] wrath Strife sedition heresies envying
[23:41] murders drunkenness rep rebeling and
[23:44] such like and we've all done that one of
[23:46] them somewhere in there we've all done
[23:48] that okay and such like if you hadn't
[23:52] that covered
[23:53] you see what that says such like if you
[23:55] aen done any of them up above there Paul
[23:57] adds and such like so Paul was giving
[24:01] you no way out you know there probably
[24:03] somebody in the congregation is going no
[24:05] I didn't do that no I didn't do that no
[24:07] I ain't done that I ain't done that I
[24:08] ain't done that then he gets down Paul
[24:10] says and such like he says oh okay I did
[24:14] that of which I tell you before as I
[24:17] have also told you in times past so he's
[24:20] brought this up
[24:23] before that that okay to say he's
[24:25] brought this up before all right that ye
[24:28] which do such things shall not inherit
[24:31] the kingdom of God all
[24:33] right
[24:35] but you didn't leave it to that part
[24:39] but it did not it does not say the
[24:42] fruits of the spirit we say that wrong
[24:45] every time we say it it's not fruits
[24:49] right it's
[24:51] fruit of the spirit see it right there
[24:54] doesn't say fruits fruit of the spirit
[24:59] why because it's one fruit one spirit is
[25:01] coming from one place
[25:03] right love joy peace longsuffering see
[25:08] longsuffering can Co can cover
[25:10] patience
[25:12] gentleness goodness Faith meekness
[25:17] Temperance against such there is no
[25:21] law cuz the law just condemns
[25:23] you right the law just condemns you
[25:25] you're just doomed all right
[25:28] and they that are Christ have have
[25:30] crucified the flesh with the affections
[25:34] and
[25:35] lust if we live in the spirit let us
[25:38] also walk in the spirit let us not be
[25:41] desirous of vain
[25:44] Glory provoking one
[25:46] another envying one
[25:49] another so don't envy that brother Bob
[25:52] has got a meat spirit and you want one
[25:54] well it's good to have a meat Spirit but
[25:57] it's also good to be bold also good to
[26:00] be just just be who you are Paul said
[26:03] one time be content right be content
[26:05] with who you are you know and I like
[26:07] that what um what John the Baptist John
[26:11] the Baptist told those
[26:13] soldiers he said be content in your
[26:15] wages be content in what you do remember
[26:17] John said you be content with what
[26:19] you're doing you be content with what's
[26:21] going on
[26:23] okay now
[26:26] look let's read the first first few
[26:29] verses of chapter 6 cuz I'm like that
[26:32] Paul continues a thought they put
[26:33] chapters in here and all but I think
[26:35] Paul continued a letter he didn't write
[26:37] chapters he just wrote a letter he wrote
[26:40] a letter to the Galatians man took it
[26:42] and said okay he's talking about this
[26:44] over here so let's separate it and bring
[26:46] this down here but watch his thought
[26:48] just continue right on with chapter 6
[26:50] there's no break there's no break in it
[26:53] Brethren if a man be overtaken in a fall
[26:56] now what are you just talking about the
[26:58] adulter perviousness and all that ye
[27:01] which are spiritual the ones that have
[27:03] love joy peace long
[27:06] suffering restore such and one in the
[27:09] spirit of
[27:11] meekness considering
[27:16] yourself lest thou also be
[27:21] tempted you see what he's
[27:23] saying cuz if you
[27:26] don't
[27:28] consider what you done right and say
[27:31] okay I'm going to bear with this
[27:34] brother you going to get a spirit on you
[27:36] like that brother's got it may not be as
[27:41] bad but still you got to be careful yes
[27:44] sir bear one another's burdens and so
[27:47] fulfill the law of Christ now see that's
[27:50] not the law of man or the law of the Old
[27:51] Testament That's the Law of Christ for
[27:53] if a man think himself to be something
[27:55] when he is nothing he deceive himself
[27:58] but let every man prove his own work
[28:01] stop right there and then shall he have
[28:03] rejoicing in himself alone and not in
[28:07] another this is a personal walk with
[28:11] God
[28:12] personal between you and
[28:15] him okay for every man shall bear his
[28:19] own
[28:21] burden every man shall bear his own
[28:24] burden so the burden of us is to have
[28:26] virtue the burden is to have
[28:28] that's our burden God don't have burden
[28:30] we have burden but remember he's the
[28:32] burden Bearer if you can't bear it
[28:34] anymore give it to
[28:36] him but he gives you a provision which
[28:39] is love joy peace long suffering and
[28:41] it's the fruit of the
[28:43] spirit so in other
[28:46] words my Longs sufferings got to be like
[28:49] brother Bob or brother Jo or somebody
[28:53] you can't say well I'm longsuffering and
[28:55] then you act another way and brother Joe
[28:58] says well I'm longsuffering and I act
[29:00] the way Christ sposed to act no there's
[29:02] one law there the law of Christ there's
[29:04] a fruit of the spirit which is love joy
[29:07] peace longsuffering to me that all binds
[29:09] up in godliness where we're at in a
[29:11] pyramid do anybody got any questions on
[29:14] godliness cuz we're going to start on
[29:15] brotherly kindness next next week Lord
[29:18] will
[29:19] it and
[29:22] uh cuz remember to be like God is to
[29:24] have a god Consciousness your first ious
[29:28] is I'm of the world the things of the
[29:31] world and all that but you're your your
[29:34] subconscious and that that inside of the
[29:36] inside has got
[29:39] to be more real than your outside
[29:43] person you understand me yes cuz that's
[29:46] the real you in here this remember this
[29:48] just displays what's in here right so
[29:51] you see taste feel smelling here you say
[29:53] well I saw that I heard
[29:56] that that's just to contact the world
[29:59] with that's just the that's just the
[30:01] conduit to get it to your brain in your
[30:03] brain is where you do the
[30:07] cooking the brain is where you cook
[30:09] things
[30:10] up or throw things out one of the two
[30:14] that's imagination you can sit there and
[30:16] imagine the people talking about you or
[30:17] you imagin or you can imagine that that
[30:20] you know this person that it all comes
[30:23] down to an individual affair with God
[30:25] that's right period amen you and God
[30:28] alone that's why I told them down in
[30:30] Miami I said look there's no preacher
[30:32] going to speak our body change they were
[30:34] a little silent but there's not they
[30:36] can't one person do it our brother
[30:38] Brandon would have to come back and one
[30:40] person would speak a body chain no it's
[30:42] got to come from what's inside of you
[30:44] right you'll speak your body change now
[30:47] we're not going to stand there one day I
[30:48] don't think and go today my body is
[30:50] going to be changed no I think we're
[30:51] going to walk in the word so much to
[30:53] where it's just going to take over amen
[30:55] and we're going to say this is it right
[30:57] we're done this is the finish this is
[31:00] the finish of it all we we've got the
[31:02] word that we need we' got the position
[31:04] that we're in now God it's up to you to
[31:07] change my body right and then you and
[31:09] then you'll be changed cuz I don't think
[31:11] we have to gather under a tent and one
[31:12] person speak our body change I I that's
[31:15] I don't I don't believe that amen
[31:17] because it's in an individual affair
[31:19] with God so but we will be changed at
[31:21] the same time right I believe I believe
[31:24] we will I think it's already been
[31:29] yes it has it had to be now we got to
[31:32] move into that we've got to believe that
[31:34] it's already it's like dad's preaching
[31:35] now we got to believe it's already been
[31:37] done right and it did start the day you
[31:40] got born again your change did begin
[31:42] Butz man it should have changed you
[31:44] right that's right it should have
[31:46] changed you there where the change
[31:47] starts amen but remember you still got
[31:50] that memory reason conscience affection
[31:53] imagination all that stuff bald around
[31:55] you that the devil shoot you with but
[31:58] just remember that godliness is to have
[32:00] a god Consciousness to act like not to
[32:03] act like God but act like Jesus which is
[32:06] God but remember you know you say well
[32:09] you need to act like Jesus
[32:11] Christ watch the money changers and
[32:14] watch the things he called hey he stood
[32:16] up congregation and called him hypocrite
[32:18] that's right Snakes in the Grass
[32:22] vipers you killed the CH you killed the
[32:25] prophets what stand up one day and say
[32:28] look just cuz you just cuz you you if
[32:29] you believe brother brandom a different
[32:31] way if you believe him uh that he's
[32:33] wrong I you've killed him right that's
[32:36] what he said that's what Jesus said
[32:37] about the prophets of old he said oh you
[32:40] just in other words you hold on to the
[32:42] books and the tapes and you shine the
[32:44] tombs but you're the ones that put him
[32:46] in
