[0:01] you come expecting I believe we're going
[0:04] to hear something from from the Lord
[0:06] today
[0:08] I want to start out by reading on John 3
[0:11] 16 because we're studying the book of
[0:13] Hebrews and on Hebrews chapter 12.
[0:16] um I really I think the sense of what
[0:18] Paul is trying to communicate as we
[0:19] study these things out is it's not
[0:20] anything that we do ourselves to be
[0:22] saved as as we read that we're we're not
[0:25] come to the mountain
[0:26] of thundering smoking uh scary things
[0:30] but we've come to the Mount Zion
[0:34] we come to the promises we have come to
[0:37] the to see the Fulfillment of all the
[0:39] promises that God made in the Old
[0:41] Testament and all through scripture that
[0:43] we have come to these things and it's
[0:44] not by our own efforts but it's by
[0:46] looking to what Jesus Christ has already
[0:48] done and you know that's really this
[0:50] morning as we as we kind of Stow these
[0:52] things out that's really the essence of
[0:53] the Gospel we're just all of our hopes
[0:55] everything we are we're looking to what
[0:57] Jesus Christ did there on the cross
[1:00] John 3 16 says for God so loved the
[1:02] world that he gave his only begotten son
[1:04] that whosoever believeth in him should
[1:07] not perish but have everlasting life so
[1:10] it's not how it works that saves us is
[1:12] what Christ did for us and if we'll just
[1:14] look to him that he'll see us through
[1:16] amen so let's before we really study
[1:19] these things out and uh get to Hebrews 4
[1:21] 12 14 15 16-17 let's just buy our heads
[1:25] and pray
[1:26] oh God we ask Lord that you'll just come
[1:28] Among Us this morning and bless this
[1:29] study as we study these words out Lord
[1:32] God I pray Lord that these things will
[1:33] be edifying to us to help us Lord to see
[1:35] things a little bit more clearly Lord
[1:37] than we just asked Lord that you'll be
[1:39] with brother Noel and he's as he's back
[1:40] there studying Lord help him Lord God as
[1:43] he prepares Lord God that our hearts
[1:44] will be prepared and just give him
[1:46] Liberty to speak your word to us this
[1:48] morning
[1:48] we ask you lord it's a blessing upon the
[1:50] congregation in your name amen and so
[1:54] verse 14 of Hebrews 12 where we've been
[1:56] reading through says follow peace with
[1:57] all men and Holiness without which no
[1:59] man shall see the Lord looking
[2:00] diligently lest any man fail of the
[2:02] grace of God lest any root of bitterness
[2:05] bringing up trouble you and thereby
[2:06] meaning be defiled of course we kind of
[2:08] Miss studying out bitterness and what
[2:09] that is but look at the example Paul
[2:11] gives us he says lest there be any
[2:13] fornicator
[2:15] or profane person as Esau who for one
[2:18] morsel of meat sold his Birthright so
[2:20] he's using an example of Esau that made
[2:23] a bad decision so he's cautioning us
[2:24] this let's let's uh make wise decisions
[2:27] count account in your head account in
[2:30] your mind what is the what is the thing
[2:32] that is most valuable in life to think
[2:34] that Esau would would trade his
[2:37] Birthright what God had promised to him
[2:39] for a little bowl of lentil soup
[2:41] a a little morsel of meat
[2:44] and that's what Paul is explaining to us
[2:46] here in verse 17 he said he said for ye
[2:48] know how that afterward when he would
[2:50] have inherited the blessing he was
[2:53] rejected because now it the blessing in
[2:55] the Old Testament had been given to his
[2:56] brother
[2:57] so now now that's where his bitterness
[2:59] sprung from it's too late now you you
[3:02] done washed your your blessing be given
[3:04] away to your brother before he found no
[3:07] place of repentance though he saw that
[3:08] carefully with tears
[3:11] and then Paul goes on to say in verse 18
[3:13] He said for ye are not come
[3:16] under the mount that might be touched
[3:18] and that burned with fire nor unto
[3:21] Blackness and darkness and Tempest and
[3:24] the sound of a trumpet and the voice of
[3:26] Words which voice they that heard and
[3:28] treated that the words should not be
[3:30] spoken to them anymore where they could
[3:32] not endure that which was commanded and
[3:34] if so much as a beast touched the
[3:36] mountain it shall be stoned or thrust
[3:39] through with a dark
[3:40] and so terrible was the sight that Moses
[3:43] said I exceedingly fear and Quake now
[3:46] think about that what Paul's expressing
[3:48] to us now he's saying you're not come to
[3:49] that
[3:51] you're not coming to that scene where
[3:54] and now let's go back in the Old
[3:55] Testament and really examine the scene
[3:57] that he's
[3:58] really telling to the Hebrews you know
[4:01] he was speaking to a group that that
[4:04] letter that he wrote was a a group of
[4:07] people that were familiar with the Old
[4:08] Testament scriptures but you know
[4:10] sometimes you know the Gentiles are were
[4:12] maybe not so much familiar with the
[4:14] things that he was referring to but he
[4:16] was referring to in Exodus chapter 19.
[4:18] I'll just read a few scriptures so you
[4:21] can kind of compare the two in verse 16
[4:23] he said and it came to pass on the third
[4:25] day in the morning that there were
[4:27] Thunders and Lightnings and a thick
[4:28] Cloud this this is the chapter where God
[4:30] is making a covenant promise to Israel
[4:33] and he told Moses to gather everybody
[4:35] together on the third day that God is
[4:37] going to speak to them and he's going to
[4:38] make all these promises to him and he
[4:41] and he told them I'm going to make we'll
[4:42] read the promises of the Covenant that
[4:44] he made in a moment I'm going to make
[4:46] you a holy nation I'm gonna I'm gonna
[4:48] make you a kingdom of priests
[4:50] everybody's going to be a priest
[4:52] everybody in the world will be able to
[4:53] see the witness now you think about the
[4:55] day we're living in right now the
[4:57] comparison that that the what God wanted
[5:01] wanted to use them for and and
[5:04] um and as we read this kind of think
[5:07] let's let's make it a present tense
[5:09] story that God wanted to make all these
[5:12] promises to them but he wasn't God's
[5:14] intention was not that they would have
[5:16] to do something but they were just here
[5:18] he's word and that God would affect his
[5:21] purpose in their lives and they got it
[5:24] wrong they got the interpretation of
[5:26] what God wanted wrong and that's how
[5:28] maybe sometimes we come to church and we
[5:30] hear the gospel preached and we begin to
[5:32] think that I've got to do something
[5:33] but it comes down to you just look to
[5:35] the Cross look to what Jesus did and
[5:38] have faith in him it's not that you are
[5:40] doing anything
[5:42] you know your your whole journey
[5:46] starts with you you can't even you can't
[5:49] even make a move to God because he said
[5:50] no man can come to the father except the
[5:52] father draw him so it's all God doing it
[5:55] you hear the gospel preached and
[5:56] something begins to stir in your heart
[5:58] and he begins to pull at you and you
[5:59] surrender your life and you go down into
[6:02] the water but it's all him doing it and
[6:04] drawing you and pulling you to himself
[6:06] it's not oh thank God that we've got a
[6:09] gospel where we don't have nothing to do
[6:10] in it it's not how much you pray or how
[6:13] much you fast or how much you work or
[6:15] how much how much psychology you can
[6:17] read or how much all of these different
[6:18] things you can do it's all God doing it
[6:21] to think that as you hear them as you
[6:23] hear the word being preached today if
[6:25] you just let that word have an effect in
[6:27] your life it will accomplish the purpose
[6:29] that it was sent for it won't return to
[6:31] God void that it will have an effect in
[6:33] you you're in
[6:35] so this Covenant promise that God is
[6:38] making in verse in in Hebrews in Exodus
[6:40] chapter 19 verse 16 and it came to pass
[6:44] on the third day in the morning that
[6:46] there were Thunders and Lightnings and a
[6:47] thick Cloud upon the mount
[6:49] and the voice of the trumpet exceeding
[6:51] loud so that all the people that was in
[6:53] the camp trembled and Moses brought
[6:55] forth the people out of the camp to meet
[6:57] with God and they stood at the nether
[6:59] part of the mount and Mount Sinai was
[7:01] all together on a smoke because the Lord
[7:04] descended upon it in Fire and the smoke
[7:06] thereof ascended as the smoke of a
[7:08] furnace and the whole Mount quaked
[7:11] greatly and when the voice of the
[7:13] trumpet sounded long and waxed louder
[7:15] and louder Moses spake
[7:18] and God answered him by voice now let's
[7:21] just go back real quick and just read
[7:23] again what Paul was saying here he's
[7:24] saying you are not come under the mount
[7:26] that might be touched and that burned
[7:28] with fire and or into Blackness and
[7:29] darkness and Tempest and the sound of
[7:31] trumpet and the voice of words and all
[7:33] those those things let's let's read what
[7:36] brother Brown said in Jehovah Jireh he
[7:38] said now that Covenant lasted Israel on
[7:41] up until they made their final mistake
[7:44] Exodus 19 hundreds of years later when
[7:46] God had looked what Grace had provided
[7:48] the unconditional covenant not on any
[7:52] grounds at all but just on Grace it was
[7:55] provided now see how man's mind can
[7:58] twist the promise of Grace into this is
[8:00] what happened there in Exodus 19 to
[8:02] where they began to think that God
[8:03] wanted them to do something to be
[8:05] pleasing to God and isn't that what Paul
[8:08] has already explained to us in Hebrews
[8:10] 11 that faith is how you please God
[8:13] the way that you please God is just by
[8:15] believing him it's not that you work up
[8:17] something or try to do anything but just
[8:19] believe God and then believe in God will
[8:22] produce works in your life but we don't
[8:24] put Works before Faith Works comes after
[8:26] Faith works as a product of faith
[8:29] when they were taking their Journey to
[8:31] the promised land as God had promised
[8:33] back here Abraham his seed would sojourn
[8:35] in a Strange Land for 400 years under
[8:37] bondage but would come out look they was
[8:40] already out from under the bondage God
[8:42] by Grace had provided them a prophet a
[8:44] pillar of fire a sacrificial lamb a
[8:47] greatest Revival that ever had and that
[8:49] was standing on the bank's dancing
[8:51] beating tambourines and having a real
[8:53] Pentecostal Jubilee everything their
[8:55] enemies all killed behind him and
[8:57] everything and yet they wanted something
[9:00] to argue about
[9:01] they wanted to get a law so they could
[9:04] have something to do into it
[9:07] now there's there's The Human Condition
[9:09] that we want something to do and we want
[9:12] some we want our part when our kids are
[9:14] going astray we want to go in metal with
[9:17] it and and do something but so many
[9:19] times the right answer is just let turn
[9:22] loose and let God have his way let God
[9:24] let God move on the scene God will bring
[9:26] it his word to pass Amen in Exodus 19
[9:30] where if we look what the Covenant is
[9:32] look what God promised them at the
[9:34] beginning of that chapter
[9:36] and Moses went up unto God and the Lord
[9:38] called unto him out of the mountain
[9:39] saying Thou shalt thou say to the house
[9:42] of Jacob and tell the children of Israel
[9:44] you have seen what I did unto the
[9:46] Egyptians and how I bear You On Eagle's
[9:48] Wings and brought you unto myself
[9:50] now therefore if you will obey my voice
[9:52] indeed
[9:53] now these I've got these four parts
[9:55] highlighted and keep my Covenant
[9:58] then you should be shall be a peculiar
[10:00] treasure unto me above all people and I
[10:03] think we could apply that to the present
[10:04] day that that's what God wants he wants
[10:07] you to be a peculiar treasure to him for
[10:09] all the Earth is mine and ye shall be
[10:11] unto me a kingdom of priests and of
[10:14] course what we do we know is we can type
[10:16] that today a priest makes sacrifices and
[10:18] that's why you made a sacrifice this
[10:20] morning you came to church and you made
[10:22] a sacrifice to get up out of bed and
[10:23] maybe maybe this morning you weren't
[10:25] feeling good but you'd sacrificed
[10:27] ministers sacrifice all the time they
[10:29] sacrificed their time maybe when they're
[10:31] not feeling like studying but they
[10:33] sacrifice because that's what a priest
[10:35] does that's what you're called to do is
[10:37] make sacrifices for God you sacrifice
[10:39] your life you sacrifice everything you
[10:41] are for him
[10:42] for all the Earth is mine and ye shall
[10:44] be unto me a kingdom of priests and a
[10:46] holy nation and that's what God is
[10:48] promising them that he can just by
[10:50] hearing the word and believing what he
[10:52] he promised he would he would make them
[10:54] a holy people these are the words which
[10:57] Thou shalt speak unto the children of
[10:58] Israel
[10:59] you think what the Covenant is obedience
[11:01] to God's voice
[11:03] just listen to it and do what he says
[11:06] special relationship a kingdom of
[11:08] priests and a distinct identity
[11:12] and the people said
[11:14] in verse 8 and all the people answer
[11:16] together and said all that the Lord hath
[11:19] spoken we will do
[11:22] and Moses returned the words of the
[11:24] people unto the Lord now brother Brandon
[11:26] would highlight this is the the great
[11:28] mistake that they made and that's the
[11:30] great mistake that people make today
[11:32] down through the seven Church ages as
[11:34] they hear the gospel they hear the
[11:35] message preached and they see people
[11:37] living a changed life that God has
[11:39] gotten a hold of their life and changed
[11:41] them
[11:42] they begin to think maybe not quite
[11:44] understanding that I've got I'm going to
[11:46] like like all those examples that
[11:48] brother round gave us I'm going to put
[11:50] feathers in poke the the the feathers in
[11:53] my back so I'm you know look try to fake
[11:56] it and and all those things try to work
[11:58] something up
[11:59] and spiritual adoption brother Adam said
[12:01] Moses represented the law God gave the
[12:03] children of Israel the law because that
[12:05] they wanted the law God didn't want them
[12:06] to have it that's man's choice in Exodus
[12:09] 19 they said you give us something to do
[12:11] to Merit our Salvation we'll keep a law
[12:13] if you'll give it to us in other words
[12:15] but it never was God's plan it's better
[12:19] just to quit planning yourself and just
[12:22] use his plans I find that much easier
[12:26] to take his plan
[12:29] right and uh he swore by himself he said
[12:31] when they come out with him God out in
[12:33] the wilderness said oh oh give us
[12:34] something to do
[12:36] we want to form us an organization and
[12:38] we want you to give us something to do
[12:40] let us make us something like this give
[12:43] us a law to keep Exodus 19 was the
[12:46] greatest mistake that Israel ever made
[12:49] when Grace had already provided their
[12:52] salvation and they wanted something to
[12:54] do to Merit it God already swore to
[12:58] Abraham what he was going to do what he
[13:01] was going to get to go now see why I
[13:03] read John 3 16 at the beginning there's
[13:05] nothing you can do to Merit salvation
[13:06] it's all on Christ what he did on the
[13:09] cross that's what we're preaching is
[13:11] Christ amen they said let us have the
[13:14] law and the law never did no one never
[13:16] kept it they never did because you're
[13:19] not saved by works you try to be saved
[13:22] by works and try to keep all the letter
[13:24] of the law and sooner or later you'll
[13:25] mess up somewhere oh but God when God
[13:29] puts that law in your heart
[13:30] it changes your desire that changes
[13:32] everything
[13:34] the law what does the law do the law is
[13:37] is like exposes our guilt our need for
[13:40] something and now see this is now I'm
[13:43] I'm talking about the gospel message
[13:44] this morning we're going to kind of back
[13:46] up and just make it real simple to
[13:49] declare what what really is the gospel
[13:51] the law declare it exposes your guilt
[13:53] let's examine like what the Ten
[13:55] Commandments are really saying that thou
[13:57] shalt have no other gods before me and
[13:59] then we put all these things in our life
[14:01] maybe if you if you if we put all these
[14:05] things before God and put maybe our
[14:08] family or uh you know even sometimes
[14:10] things that look good before God and
[14:13] then you're you're guilty before God you
[14:16] see if we go down this list of all these
[14:18] things it exposes the need for a savior
[14:21] Thou shalt not make unto thee even
[14:23] engraven image Thou shalt not take the
[14:25] name of the Lord thy God in vain you
[14:27] know you wouldn't even you wouldn't use
[14:28] your mama's name and uh just as like a
[14:32] byword or something but people will use
[14:34] the name of Jesus as just kind of
[14:36] something to just toss around when they
[14:38] wouldn't even you do that with their
[14:39] mama and you see when you do that it's
[14:42] exposing your guilt that you need a
[14:44] savior that's what the law the law is
[14:46] like a judge pointing his finger at you
[14:48] saying you're guilty you need something
[14:50] remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy
[14:53] honor thy father and thy mother or their
[14:55] respect you know if you you think about
[14:58] all the times brother Brown talked about
[14:59] how he would talk back to his mama and
[15:01] and daddy until his mouth was just
[15:03] mushed and he had to drink through a
[15:05] straw that's my testimony I I had such a
[15:08] bad temper when I was young I was
[15:10] constantly in trouble for uh back
[15:13] talking and things and you we're all
[15:15] guilty of things like that and you see
[15:17] the word is preached and it begins to
[15:19] expose your guilt that there's something
[15:21] wrong that you need a savior
[15:24] Thou shalt not kill and Jesus magnified
[15:26] the law and said if you speak against
[15:28] your brother behind his back if you
[15:30] gossip then you've you're guilty of
[15:31] murder Thou shalt not commit adultery
[15:33] but you just look at a woman with lust
[15:36] in your heart and you've committed
[15:37] adultery with her already in your heart
[15:38] so there the law is exposing our need
[15:41] for a savior that it's not by works
[15:43] within ourselves that we can do how can
[15:45] we satisfy the law when the law makes us
[15:47] guilty
[15:49] Thou shalt not steal Thou shalt not bear
[15:52] false witness against thy neighbor and
[15:54] thou shalt not covet oh we really if we
[15:57] really dive into all these things what
[15:59] kind of guilt would it expose we need a
[16:01] savior but Grace law puts us in jail but
[16:05] Grace the grace of God sets us free
[16:08] that's what John 8 3 6 3 8 36 says that
[16:12] if the son therefore shall make you free
[16:14] ye shall be free indeed free from free
[16:18] from all all the bondage that the devil
[16:20] has put you under Galatians 5 1 says
[16:22] Stand Fast therefore in the Liberty
[16:24] wherewith Christ has made us free and be
[16:26] not entangled again with the Yoke of
[16:28] bondage now you think about I was
[16:30] thinking about this the other day it's a
[16:32] a young person asked me what's what's
[16:34] your favorite Doctrine and you might say
[16:36] well my favorite Doctrine you might go
[16:38] to a doctrine that maybe could make you
[16:40] look real big in the head and make you
[16:42] something to give you brag brag and rice
[16:44] to show the great Revelation that you
[16:46] have but you know I began to think my
[16:48] favorite Doctrine
[16:49] is it is free there's nothing you got to
[16:53] do for salvation it's a free gift from
[16:56] God that is my favorite doctrine that
[16:58] there's nothing when you come to church
[16:59] this morning there ain't nothing you got
[17:01] to do to get it all you got to do is
[17:03] look to him look to Jesus Christ
[17:06] and Roman all these things this slide
[17:09] I'm here I've got here displayed it
[17:10] Grace Grace is a free gift from God that
[17:14] you didn't have to do nothing to get
[17:16] anything Romans 6 22 says but now being
[17:20] made free from sin and become servants
[17:23] to God you have your fruit unto Holiness
[17:26] and the end everlasting life
[17:29] and taking signs with Jesus
[17:31] brother Brown said not by works not by
[17:34] Deeds not about power not by might by my
[17:38] spirit saith God not what I done what I
[17:41] am or what I will be but what he is and
[17:44] I am in him
[17:46] and whatever he is I'm part of him amen
[17:49] I'm saved because I'm part of him and he
[17:52] is God and I'm part of him being his son
[17:54] that's right so ain't what I done
[17:57] but what I will do is what he has done
[18:00] that's my trust right there now that
[18:05] means
[18:06] that means that you know you go into the
[18:08] bookstore and you'll find all these
[18:09] self-help books and things that you can
[18:11] read and we try to work up something and
[18:13] you know even in Matthew 6 27 says I I
[18:16] love this scripture but Jesus said which
[18:18] of You by taking thought and I'm going
[18:20] to apply it to like you go into the
[18:22] bookstore and you pull all these
[18:23] self-help books off the off the shelf
[18:25] and it says you've got a problem maybe
[18:27] maybe with pride or maybe you got a
[18:29] problem with whatever and you try you
[18:31] you want to think real hard I I want to
[18:34] I want to get rid of that but it's not
[18:37] by thinking real hard you can take you
[18:40] can take thought as much as you want but
[18:42] it won't add one cubit under your
[18:44] stature that's why I I want to this
[18:46] morning devalue poking at one another
[18:48] and identifying one another's faults but
[18:50] that because that's not how it works and
[18:53] you're not going to get rid of Pride or
[18:54] enmity or anything like that by going up
[18:56] to somebody and say look at all this
[18:57] enmity you got but I tell you what to
[19:00] get rid of it is when you let the word
[19:02] of God have an effect in your life and
[19:04] you become subject to the word and let
[19:05] it blame you it's not by
[19:07] self-improvement it's not by mindfulness
[19:09] or goal setting or behavior modification
[19:12] or going to Alcoholics Anonymous or
[19:14] communities and sitting around and
[19:15] sharing your ideas and your opinions but
[19:18] it's the word of God claiming your life
[19:20] and having an effect in you
[19:22] it's not by works and we could go
[19:24] through all these things observing
[19:25] rituals and moral Purity and fasting and
[19:28] all that all the things maybe that even
[19:29] the Catholic Church will do regular
[19:31] confessions and almsgiving and
[19:32] pilgrimages and so forth and so on
[19:36] it all just becomes legalism and
[19:39] legalism you know if you really examine
[19:41] it it's the belief that salvation or
[19:44] favor with God can be earned through
[19:46] strict adherence to religious rules
[19:48] rituals and moral codes
[19:51] believing that one's own efforts and
[19:54] good works can secure your salvation
[19:59] now let's not lose sight of where we are
[20:01] we we're reading Exodus 19 and studying
[20:04] these things out and studying out what
[20:06] Paul meant it was as he was saying we're
[20:08] not at that mountain where they were we
[20:10] have come to the Fulfillment all the
[20:12] promises of scripture we have come to
[20:14] Mount Zion
[20:15] and a great company of angels and the
[20:18] thick cloud of witnesses and all those
[20:20] things
[20:21] legalism look what legalism does if you
[20:24] come like they did it there in Exodus 19
[20:26] it can lead to a self-righteous attitude
[20:30] because you believe that your saved by
[20:32] works by the things that you're doing
[20:34] and a judgmental Outlet towards others
[20:36] who did not adhere to the same set of
[20:38] rules it can also create a sense of
[20:40] pride in one's own achievements and a
[20:43] constant fear of falling short or not
[20:45] measuring up to the required standard
[20:49] brother Randall said in God's covenant
[20:51] with Abraham and his seed he said in the
[20:52] Dove
[20:53] was not cleave apart when when God
[20:57] put when Abraham made his sacrifice and
[21:00] God put him to sleep there and showed
[21:02] him the burning lamp moving between the
[21:03] sacrifices and so forth the dove wasn't
[21:05] clever part but the animal showing the
[21:07] difference between them that there would
[21:09] be a time that law would change to Grace
[21:11] and so forth Grace was first and Grace
[21:15] had already provided a savior down in
[21:18] Egypt they already had a Moses to
[21:20] deliver them out they already had a
[21:22] sacrifice
[21:23] they already had everything
[21:26] but where Israel made her final fatal
[21:28] move is in Exodus 9 Exodus 19 where she
[21:31] taken on and wanted law and rejected
[21:34] Grace that's right Grace is always right
[21:39] not what you do
[21:40] it's what you believe
[21:42] it isn't works lest any man should boast
[21:46] is by grace are you saved through faith
[21:49] faith and what's what's Grace here's a
[21:52] picture of a man leaving prison he's
[21:53] been set free he's got his paperwork
[21:55] there he's he's on his way home it's
[21:57] unmerited favor
[21:59] freely given by God without any
[22:02] requirement for humans to earn it
[22:05] there's nothing for you to do to earn it
[22:09] and cut the message conference brother
[22:11] said the children of Israel on the road
[22:13] back they had another conference with
[22:15] God Moses did at the Red Sea we'll call
[22:17] that the Red Sea conference one right in
[22:19] the line of duty lay trouble and listen
[22:22] Christians there's where you'll make
[22:24] your fatal mistake there's what Israel
[22:27] made her fatal mistake when she asked
[22:29] for a law to serve God by in Exodus 19
[22:32] after Grace had done provided his savior
[22:35] Moses a prophet done provided a lamb
[22:37] done provided a covenant done provided
[22:39] all these things and yet they wanted
[22:41] something to do themselves they wanted
[22:43] some theology
[22:45] that's what's the matter today if we'd
[22:48] have left Pentecost the way it was at
[22:49] the beginning but we had to have
[22:51] something to argue about
[22:53] we had to be Oneness Tunis threeness
[22:56] Church of God
[22:58] all these riding humpback camels of one
[23:01] hump two humps three humps and so forth
[23:03] what difference does it make how many
[23:06] humps a camel's got as long as we're
[23:09] riding in what difference does it make
[23:12] whether you're in a Ford or a Chevrolet
[23:15] just keep moving now let's meditate on
[23:19] that statement just a moment
[23:21] doesn't matter where you are just keep
[23:24] moving it doesn't matter if you're in a
[23:27] good spot or a bad spot just keep moving
[23:29] just keep moving on now isn't that
[23:31] exactly what Paul's been explaining with
[23:33] all these Parables and examples of
[23:34] running a race you're in a race so don't
[23:37] stop just keep moving it doesn't matter
[23:40] whether you're in a Ford or Chevrolet
[23:42] whether somebody you see it doesn't
[23:44] matter whether somebody maybe believes a
[23:46] little bit different than you do
[23:48] where all God's got us all in control
[23:50] and he's all drawing us into Oneness
[23:52] with him so just keep moving I I think
[23:55] that's what Paul is trying to express
[23:57] here it's like you're in a race and it
[23:59] doesn't matter if you're at like this
[24:01] man here in this picture in bad shape it
[24:03] doesn't matter maybe if you just fall in
[24:05] the ditch you just get get back up and
[24:07] you you just just keep moving no matter
[24:09] where you are in life get back up and
[24:12] keep going what difference does it make
[24:14] brother Brown said whether you're in a
[24:16] Ford or a Chevrolet
[24:18] just keep moving amen for a year not
[24:22] come under the mount that might be
[24:23] touched and that burn with fire nor unto
[24:27] Blackness and darkness and Tempest but
[24:30] ye are come unto Mount Zion
[24:33] now somebody told me it says when you're
[24:36] reading these scriptures and things it
[24:37] sounds like you're making this a present
[24:39] tense thing and and I want to say I'm
[24:42] not Paul is Paul is the one that said
[24:45] we're we're preaching a present tense
[24:47] gospel that he's the same yesterday
[24:50] today and forever you listen sometimes
[24:53] to the way that people talk and it seems
[24:56] I think we've been putting things way
[24:57] off in the future for so long it's time
[25:00] to believe and it it's the coming of the
[25:02] Lord the coming of the Lord is always a
[25:05] present tense reality even if there are
[25:07] more aspects and things to be unfolded
[25:10] in the future but yet he's here right
[25:11] now he's here and I missed doing wonders
[25:15] and he's working a miracle in your life
[25:17] as he's changing you and that's what I
[25:19] believe Paul is saying when he says you
[25:21] you are come unto the Fulfillment
[25:23] whatever every prom every promise every
[25:25] type in the Old Testament was speaking
[25:27] of where you are right now you are
[25:30] coming to Mount Zion and think about
[25:32] what these things are Mount Zion and
[25:35] unto the city of the Living God speaking
[25:37] of speaking of that place where we're
[25:39] going to live but it's also speaking of
[25:40] the Bride is speaking of this this
[25:42] diagram behind me on the board here
[25:44] you're come to these things the Heavenly
[25:48] Jerusalem and to an innumerable company
[25:50] of angels what's he talking about a
[25:51] numeral numerable company of angels and
[25:54] Hebrews chapter 1 verse 14 he said that
[25:56] Angels were ministering Spirits
[25:58] ministering ministering to The Heirs of
[26:00] Salvation so you come to a place where
[26:03] those angels are attentive to you that's
[26:05] what to the general assembly and Church
[26:08] of the firstborn which are written in
[26:10] heaven unto God the judge of all and to
[26:13] spirits of just men made perfect you've
[26:16] come to you've come to where the Holy
[26:18] Ghost can make your life make make your
[26:20] soul perfect and begin to mold you into
[26:22] into the likeness of Jesus Christ
[26:25] into Jesus the mediator of the New
[26:27] Covenant and to the blood of sprinkling
[26:29] that speaketh better things
[26:31] than that of Abel you have come to these
[26:33] things in other words the the Old
[26:36] Testament and we'll stop on this the Old
[26:37] Testament had all the The Ten
[26:39] Commandments that we can read about look
[26:41] look at those stones there but now in
[26:44] present tense God has given us the
[26:47] ability that somebody is going to see
[26:49] this word live today amen and we'll stop
[26:53] on that God bless you
[26:56] foreign
[26:58] [Applause]
