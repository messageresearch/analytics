[29:37] Hypocrites the pastor was silent then he
[29:40] said can I ask you to do something for
[29:42] me before you make your final decision
[29:44] she said sure what's that he said take a

[33:35] wants us to go by amen acts 24: 24 and
[33:40] after certain days when Felix came with
[33:43] his wife Drusilla which was a Jewish he
[33:46] sent for Paul and heard him concerning
[33:49] the the faith in
[33:50] Christ and as he reasoned of
[33:53] righteousness Temperance and judgment to
[33:55] come Felix
[33:58] trembled and an and and and answered go
[34:02] thy way for this time when I have a
[34:05] convenient season I will call for thee
[34:08] she hoped he hoped also that money
[34:12] should have been given him a PA that he
[34:14] might uh loose him wherefore he sent for
[34:17] him the offerer and commune with him I
[34:19] wonder why he did that there was
[34:22] something about Paul that that just
[34:24] gripped Felix his heart right yeah verse
[34:28] 27 but after two years porus Festus came
[34:31] into Felix room and Felix willing to

[1:00:13] my house for a feast at such and such a
[1:00:16] Daye hands it to his curier and his cuer
[1:00:18] takes off and brother Bram said in that
[1:00:21] day it was hot and that cuer was looking
[1:00:23] for Jesus
[1:00:25] amen he's going back and forth and he's
[1:00:27] probably sweating and he's tired and
[1:00:29] he's weary and he gets to this town

[1:01:04] Peter this time and Peter says hey
[1:01:06] didn't philli tell
[1:01:08] you you know how Peter was he said
[1:01:11] listen just a minute oh I hear him say

[1:01:29] prophet said the same message 1955 the
[1:01:31] unwelcome Christ he said but he had a
[1:01:34] mission that seemed to be more important
[1:01:37] he said listen isn't it the truth today
[1:01:39] that our work our work and our hous work
[1:01:42] the washing and the arning are some
[1:01:44] little card party we belong to our
[1:01:46] social standing is too important to come
[1:01:48] to an old fashioned Altar and weep
[1:01:50] before him and receive him into our
[1:01:52] hearts oh how many Earthly things the
[1:01:54] tides of the earth seems to be so much
[1:01:56] greater to us than meeting Jesus he said
[1:01:59] that's the way this curier felt to get
[1:02:00] this big fat Pharisees message to Jesus
[1:02:03] was more important than the destination
[1:02:05] of his soul
[1:02:08] wow oh God help us then there he stood
[1:02:11] in the very presence of the Fountain of
[1:02:13] Life and his duties of Earth had him so

[1:02:19] need for Jesus oh God what about it this
[1:02:22] morning here mean you got an opportunity
[1:02:24] I wonder if her own social standing our

[1:02:47] lay it down he said don't let that be
[1:02:49] your stand well if he would raise up
[1:02:52] today and had the same opportunity he he

[1:11:04] means of
[1:11:05] living God came on the scene what did he
[1:11:08] do he kept his word amen then back then
[1:11:11] the prophet of God said they had seen ey
[1:11:13] Lambs instead of seen ey dogs and he had
[1:11:16] one and his wife got sick he made his
[1:11:19] way felt his way around again said Lord

[1:11:33] going down to the temple cfas is the
[1:11:35] high priest said where you going there
[1:11:36] blind Bame said I'm going to offer this

[1:11:44] blind barus ain't that your eyes said
[1:11:46] I'll give you a lamb he said I didn't
[1:11:48] promise God any lamb I promised him this
[1:11:50] lamb and because he kept his word god
[1:11:53] kept his word and there was a lamb come
[1:11:55] walking down the dusty
[1:11:57] road he was Jehovah gy God provided him
[1:12:01] a
[1:12:02] lamb I'm saying this to say this that
[1:12:05] hey there was a lot of sick and
[1:12:06] Afflicted folks probably back then in
[1:12:08] the time of Barb but he didn't want to
[1:12:10] miss his
[1:12:12] opportunity Hallelujah he said I got to
[1:12:14] get to him I got to get to
[1:12:17] Jesus
[1:12:19] hallelujah amen he took an advantage of
[1:12:22] his opportunity I think about the Rich
[1:12:24] Young Ruler he come
[1:12:26] running came running amen cuz he wanted
[1:12:30] to know fell down and the Master's knees
[1:12:33] feet and said what must I do to inherit
[1:12:36] eternal life and you don't see that too
[1:12:38] much they did come running so what must
[1:12:42] I do to already eternal life he quoted
[1:12:44] the Commandments to him and he said hey
[1:12:47] I've kept all these from my youth up
[1:12:49] that mean you to know say hey he wasn't
[1:12:51] no Renegade he probably knew Church
[1:12:53] protocol he knew how to come in and come
[1:12:55] out know how to hold his hands just
[1:12:58] right but the Lord being that God
[1:13:01] Prophet looked into his life said you
[1:13:02] lack one thing go sell what you have
[1:13:06] come take up your cross give to the poor
[1:13:09] take up your cross and follow me and
[1:13:10] you'll have Treasures in Heaven now all
[1:13:13] he seen was his treasures in his barns
[1:13:15] he couldn't see his Rapture all he see
[1:13:17] was his treasure and bar oh God and he
[1:13:19] gave that all up he missed his
[1:13:21] opportunity there he was staring eternal
[1:13:23] life right in the face but he missed it
[1:13:26] brother Wade yes sir oh brother brother
[1:13:29] Bob he missed
[1:13:31] it missed his
[1:13:33] opportunity you said one if he'd have
[1:13:35] another chance I think here's what he'd
[1:13:37] do if he had another
[1:13:39] chance you know cuz Jesus tells the
[1:13:41] parable about him the beggar laying at
[1:13:44] his door at his gate begging for crumbs
[1:13:48] and the dogs would come and lick the
[1:13:50] sores right and I imagine old that Rich
[1:13:52] Young Ruler he proba said my lord I
[1:13:55] can't have none of my associates over I
[1:13:57] can't now have none of my friend look at
[1:13:59] him such a sore sight laying there at my
[1:14:01] gate I wish he' just
[1:14:03] die so it came to that spot and he did
[1:14:06] die and then you know the story how that
[1:14:08] Jesus talks about the parable that the
[1:14:10] rich man died seeing Lazarus in the
[1:14:12] bosom of
[1:14:13] Abraham if he had another chance if he
[1:14:16] could roll back the curtain of time he
[1:14:19] wouldn't send no servant out there to
[1:14:20] get Lazarus he'd go out there himself
[1:14:23] and he'd pick up Lazarus in his arms
[1:14:26] he'd walk into his house he wouldn't put
[1:14:28] him on No guest bed he'd lay him on his
[1:14:30] bed he'd go over to the closet Rob back
[1:14:32] the closet door said anything you want
[1:14:35] Lazareth any robe whatever you want it's
[1:14:37] yours don't worry about any kind of
[1:14:40] physician I got the money I'll buy the
[1:14:43] best I'll hire the best
[1:14:45] physician any Chariot that I got it's
[1:14:48] yours but he misses
[1:14:51] opportunity can you can you imagine what
[1:14:54] about us like I said if we could roll
[1:14:56] out the curtain of
[1:15:00] time in St Luke
[1:15:03] 1941-44 Jesus is looking over Jerusalem
[1:15:07] and he's
[1:15:09] weeping he's weeping he said Old
[1:15:12] Jerusalem Jerusalem how of I would have
[1:15:14] gathered you like a hen with her brood
[1:15:17] but you would not said you missed your
[1:15:19] day of opportunity you missed your hour
[1:15:22] of visitation
[1:15:24] amen I wonder if he's looking at us this
[1:15:26] morning reaping and saying you're
[1:15:29] missing your
[1:15:30] opportunity you're missing your
[1:15:33] opportunity Ephesians 5:116 Paul writes
[1:15:36] it like that Redeeming the time because
[1:15:39] of days are evil Redeeming the time was
[1:15:41] a buying up time oh if I could buy some
[1:15:45] more time yeah if I could buy a little
[1:15:47] more extra time God help me amen
[1:15:51] Redeeming the time cuz are
[1:15:55] evil amen I believe we ought to make out
[1:15:58] make the most out of the every

[1:16:05] said earlier tomorrow this after while
[1:16:08] this church this service will be history
[1:16:10] you can't bring it
[1:16:15] back God help me I think Paul was
[1:16:17] personally familiar with the perspective
[1:16:20] that each day could be his
[1:16:22] last yeah amen I've said that a
[1:16:25] lot I remember brother way I don't know
