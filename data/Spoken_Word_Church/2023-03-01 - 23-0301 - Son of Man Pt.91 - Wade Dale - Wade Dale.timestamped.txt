[2:21] [Music]
[2:45] foreign
[3:42] God bless you all um quick little word
[3:45] here about the uh
[3:47] the PowerPoint is going to be projected
[3:48] has the lyrics so you can help us sing
[3:50] but also in the background you'll see
[3:52] the pictures of our testimonies over the
[3:54] years that my family and I have been
[3:56] through a lot that the Lord has uh been
[3:59] there for us and that's what this song
[4:00] is about that God is with you in the
[4:02] fiery trials and there's some pictures
[4:04] in their Bible scenes but most of them
[4:06] or at least half of them are family
[4:08] going through trials and the Lord's been
[4:10] there for us and just to explain what
[4:11] some of those are if you don't remember
[4:12] the
[4:14] um Goliath tree that I testified about
[4:15] that was a big hundred foot tall Hickory
[4:17] that was threatening to fall in our
[4:18] house years ago and I spoke to the tree
[4:20] and said when you fall fall this way and
[4:23] later on the storm came and it felt
[4:24] exactly that way and Gabby was also
[4:26] testifying to the kids that it would
[4:28] fall away from our house and also
[4:31] pictured in there of Ava and Eula with
[4:33] the seizures they had
[4:35] and how the Lord was there for us during
[4:37] that time there's also a picture of the
[4:40] uh the map the storm the tornado kind of
[4:42] map I guess you call it where in
[4:44] Kentucky a little over a year ago we
[4:45] were there during all those tornadoes
[4:47] and they were all around us people were
[4:48] dying I was laying their sleep I didn't
[4:50] even know so the Lord protect us and all
[4:52] that and then some other pictures in
[4:55] there the most important lesson I
[4:56] learned from that trial with Ava I think
[4:58] when she was dying at three days old is
[5:00] that um
[5:02] not to question God where are you at
[5:04] because that was the last time I ever
[5:05] said that I said God where are you at I
[5:07] knew he was real I knew he's been with
[5:09] us but it's like things were happening
[5:10] that seemed like he was just letting it
[5:12] go on and didn't we didn't sense his
[5:14] presence there so even when you don't
[5:16] know the Lord's there he's with you
[5:17] forgot forgot my pick I got that

[12:46] Rebecca in their prayers
[12:49] um she originally was having a lot of
[12:51] pain a few months ago
[12:53] and um thought it might have been a
[12:55] hernia but she went to the doctor
[12:59] um
[12:59] found out it was swollen lymph nodes and
[13:02] so she got a biopsy I believe Monday and
[13:06] they said it she thought it was just one
[13:08] but then they told her it could be four
[13:10] to five swollen lymph nodes and they
[13:13] said it could just be an infection but
[13:15] it could be lymphoma so they tested her
[13:18] and they um she said she doesn't know
[13:20] when she'll get the results back but

[20:47] Lord will take that away and uh
[20:50] I think one thing's for sure
[20:53] I think maybe back in the 70s or early
[20:56] 80s
[20:58] um
[20:59] somebody came out with a with music on
[21:02] the television
[21:06] it was called MTV
[21:09] we got message television
[21:12] MTV you've started something brother
[21:14] right now I guarantee you somebody else
[21:16] is going to pick that up and they gonna
[21:17] have the
[21:19] have the message television I don't mind
[21:21] them that other mess that's outside I
[21:24] don't want them but to have something
[21:26] like that for an impact to show that
[21:28] there is another in the fire
[21:30] there's somebody there to stand with you
[21:33] the Fourth Man In The Fire And that's a
[21:35] little bit kind of what we're going to
[21:37] still
[21:38] get on to tonight is justification
[21:41] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[21:42] and the word so it's four the number
[21:45] four is not bad when you when you put it
[21:47] to the Earth to Redemption because
[21:49] everybody knows there's one thing for
[21:51] sure we want and have to be redeemed
[21:55] we want to be redeemed we don't there is
[21:58] not a I was looking up the word just a
[22:00] minute ago I I've been talking about a
[22:02] plan and you got a plan God's Got A Plan
[22:05] brother Adam said God had a plan and a
[22:06] purpose a plan is a method of achieving
[22:09] an end
[22:10] he said oh well I don't mean God yeah he
[22:13] this thing's going to end let me tell
[22:14] you something sin's got an expiration
[22:17] date
[22:18] amen
[22:19] this worldly knowledge all your sickness
[22:21] all your sorrow all your pain all
[22:23] everything you got
[22:26] has an end
[22:29] amen yeah well give me one give me come
[22:31] on give me one to God
[22:33] but sin has an expiration date just
[22:36] think about that but you don't
[22:38] ain't God don't
[22:40] he never has any never will God said it
[22:43] and that's the way it's going to be like
[22:44] I said many times before if God loved
[22:47] you in the beginning
[22:48] bro George he's got to still love you
[22:51] because he can't change his mind
[22:53] he has no ups and downs you and I have
[22:56] the ups and downs but there is a method
[22:58] or a plan of achieving that end
[23:01] what the end of all things the end of
[23:03] all things here for us to go and bring
[23:06] Glory into view and bring the Eternal
[23:08] part to all of us even to the Earth all
[23:11] right I like that a plan is a detailed
[23:14] formulation of a program of action
[23:16] God formulated a program and it's not
[23:19] going to change it was the perfect one
[23:20] to begin with we've just got to do what
[23:23] connect ourselves to it
[23:25] we don't connect ourselves to it we're
[23:26] not part of the plan we got to become
[23:28] part of the plan by the new birth so
[23:31] that we can even understand this thing
[23:32] called a plan and a purpose amen so
[23:34] let's um
[23:36] let's bow our heads and I know we all
[23:38] have uh requests on our heart let's pray
[23:40] for these ones that are really sick
[23:43] um
[23:44] I really I really burden in our heart
[23:46] when we started hearing today of all the
[23:49] ones that were sick and couldn't get
[23:50] here tonight we uh
[23:52] we appreciate the ones that we did
[23:55] and we're going to pray now for the ones
[23:57] that can't and we're going to pray that
[23:58] everything will be fine they'll be back
[24:00] on Sunday so let's pray dear Lord thank
[24:03] you for this evening that you give us
[24:04] Lord in the middle of the week Lord just
[24:06] give us a Rejuvenation of of in our
[24:09] spirit realm Lord father we know that
[24:11] the soul is set on fire by the new birth
[24:13] and it's continually burning but our
[24:15] spirit needs a little bit of extra Lord
[24:18] our merry reason conscious effects and
[24:20] Imagination should be turned towards you
[24:21] Lord and we'll give you Lord to praise
[24:24] and honor and glory for this whole
[24:25] service we yield ourselves to you Lord
[24:28] and we pray that you would just bless us
[24:29] now as a congregation Lord be with the
[24:32] ones that are sick that can't be with us
[24:33] tonight Lord the ones that are watching
[24:35] in Lord thank you so much for technology
[24:37] that we can get to the ones that want to
[24:40] sit and listen and hear about you father
[24:43] we ask you forgive us of our sins and
[24:45] our many mistakes Lord that we make to
[24:47] sanctify us for this journey or this
[24:49] plan that we're talking about Lord keep
[24:51] us clean because we know there's one
[24:53] thing for sure Satan wants to dirty
[24:55] everything he can but father you gave us
[24:57] clean water you gave us washing of the
[24:59] Water by the word and that word's what's
[25:01] going to keep us clean if we'll just
[25:03] attach ourselves to it father I pray now
[25:06] that you should be with us in the
[25:07] further minutes of service in Jesus name
[25:09] amen we're on son of man part 91 in the
[25:12] beginning was the word where was with
[25:13] God the Word was God and that word was
[25:17] made flesh
[25:19] there had to come a time when God
[25:22] father Jehovah Elohim
[25:26] um theophany God had to become flesh
[25:30] because he couldn't know how
[25:32] that we live without him living with us
[25:35] all right
[25:36] but he dwelt with us and dwelt among us
[25:38] and we behold his glory the glory of the
[25:39] only begotten of the father full of
[25:41] grace and truth we saw did you see it no
[25:44] but we saw by the eyes of faith we see
[25:46] by Matthew Martin Luke and John we see
[25:48] by all the disciples and all the ones
[25:50] that wrote down what Jesus acted like
[25:53] when he was on the earth and that's what
[25:55] we have to do is act according to that
[25:58] full of grace and truth II Peter 1 5
[26:00] would try to get to patience tonight
[26:03] just have patience please
[26:06] and besides this giving all diligence
[26:08] add to your faith virtue to verse your
[26:10] knowledge
[26:11] to knowledge Temperance to Temperance
[26:13] patience and the patience
[26:15] godliness in Luke 21 19 Jesus tells us
[26:18] is in your patience
[26:20] in your patience
[26:22] possess ye your soul
[26:25] you may be seated in the Lord has
[26:26] blessing to the reading of the word
[26:28] in your patience possess you your souls
[26:31] but it's going to take us a time because
[26:33] that plan any good plan has a beginning
[26:36] and any good plan has an end and then
[26:38] all way in between that might be
[26:40] sometimes that in a football plan they
[26:42] formulate a plan and they're like this
[26:43] is what's going to happen and we're
[26:45] going to run the ball because they're
[26:46] not going to be able to stop us and and
[26:48] then they get up to about the second
[26:50] quarter brother George and they can't
[26:52] run two yards
[26:53] the defense has John picked up on what
[26:55] they're doing and they have to what
[26:56] change their plan but God doesn't do
[26:58] that God's not wanting to get in the
[27:00] middle of the plan and say oh sorry
[27:01] we'll go this other way no this is his
[27:03] plan what we have to do as human beings
[27:05] is we have to get into that plant all
[27:08] right we don't have to just listen to it
[27:10] we have to be a part of that plan
[27:12] because the plan and purpose was what us
[27:15] to go back to the Garden of Eden
[27:17] condition that's what we're looking at
[27:18] now and only by the word of God can we
[27:21] do that oh by the way brother Tim said
[27:23] to tell you thank you for the weekend
[27:26] um I think yesterday or day before we uh
[27:29] we convert uh text each other and he
[27:31] said he really had a good time and I
[27:32] appreciate it I watched a good bit of
[27:34] most of it not all of it yet but good
[27:36] bit of it and then he did a good job
[27:38] he's grown a lot in Grace and knowledge
[27:40] himself
[27:41] he's got a little bit bigger too Bliss
[27:43] it's hard I'll tell him that's what I
[27:44] see
[27:45] so anyway you can tell him if you've
[27:47] seen first okay but let's pull his heart
[27:49] up and we're all getting that way June
[27:51] and I are on Weight Watchers now so
[27:52] we're gonna we're gonna start lifting
[27:54] some weight
[27:55] bless our heart
[27:58] I'm not gonna be like bro Dale always
[28:00] said about Aaron said you're just going
[28:01] to be hard to Rapture because there's a
[28:03] lot of you to rapture
[28:05] you know so
[28:12] oh I'm sorry you're supposed to look
[28:13] like this way you turn like this and you
[28:15] look like the rest of them
[28:17] but as I said before our soul is
[28:20] redeemed our soul is that's the firing
[28:22] mechanism that even it'll fire you in
[28:25] faith and it fires you in doubt in other
[28:27] words you're moving and breathing and
[28:28] looking and and conversing and listening
[28:31] all by your soul
[28:33] that's the real you
[28:35] the real you is the soul not the spirit
[28:38] the real you is the soul now the soul
[28:41] then what it goes and it this the soul
[28:44] is the nature of the spirit so whatever
[28:45] that nature shows in the spirit realm is
[28:48] what you have in your soul all right but
[28:50] we still have problems we still have our
[28:53] own ideas our own wants our own things
[28:56] in the spirit realm to where God can uh
[29:00] use your imagination and so can Satan
[29:02] God can use your conscience and so can
[29:04] the devil but God can't use your soul
[29:07] and Satan use it too
[29:09] you're either born again or not in your
[29:12] soul so there's Faith or doubt that's it
[29:14] there's no gray area there there is a
[29:17] walk in the Lord through justification
[29:19] and sanctification but when you get to
[29:21] sanctification if you stop there that
[29:23] unclean spirit is going to go right back
[29:24] in that little hole right here
[29:26] it's going to go right back in that
[29:27] little hole right there and it's going
[29:29] to make you worse because it's going to
[29:31] give you a religious spirit then all
[29:33] this is going to act religious
[29:35] that's why brother Brown said you can
[29:36] have the baptism of the Holy Ghost every
[29:38] day in your life on your spirit realm
[29:40] right here
[29:41] and dying go to hell because that man
[29:43] right there is one that's going to be
[29:44] judged not this guy and not this guy
[29:48] you're not going to be judged your flesh
[29:50] is not going to be judged the Bible says
[29:51] the soul that sinneth it will surely die
[29:53] all right so that's what we're looking
[29:55] at so we're out in the spirit realm now
[29:57] this is the statue of perfect man I
[29:59] wanted you to kind of back up just a
[30:01] minute now let's look let's think about
[30:03] the other day
[30:04] that's your walk with God we know that
[30:07] but that is the absolute
[30:10] um characteristics of Jesus Christ
[30:13] his Spirit was the Holy Spirit so now
[30:16] what's happening to me and you is that
[30:18] Holy Spirit has went into our soul
[30:21] to give us a new birth make us God made
[30:23] manifest in another form make us the
[30:25] word made flesh and then we have because
[30:27] of our carnal nature our imagination
[30:30] conscious memory reason and affection is
[30:33] working against us
[30:36] contrary the Bible says to God
[30:39] now you were contrary to God in your
[30:41] soul but now let's we're born again all
[30:43] right we're born again we have the fire
[30:44] of God listen we got the Fourth Man in
[30:47] the fire
[30:48] he's not just in there with us he's
[30:51] inside of us all right and it's burning
[30:53] and it should be able to to uh display
[30:56] itself a little bit more we just need to
[30:59] let it out somebody ought to say that
[31:02] and then into our spirit realm is where
[31:04] this is going to be working
[31:07] all this we've already been Faith virtue
[31:09] and up to knowledge when I look at we'll
[31:11] look at something and just a minute
[31:12] about knowledge we've got to have
[31:14] knowledge that this thing's right
[31:17] we got to have the knowledge of God that
[31:19] this thing I say this thing this message
[31:21] the the plan that we see see there's a
[31:25] plan out in the denominational World
[31:26] they have a plan
[31:28] but their plan is to go to judgment
[31:30] their plan is to go to seven years
[31:33] tribulation their plan is I ain't
[31:36] perfect you ain't perfect their plan is
[31:38] follow us on the Holy Ghost as a way to
[31:39] baptize
[31:41] but that's not the plan of God
[31:43] that's the plan of the devil
[31:46] but they're what they're accepting that
[31:48] plan because sometimes they don't even
[31:50] know any different I was talking to a
[31:52] couple of people in Ohio
[31:53] just coming into the messaging and some
[31:57] had been away from the message of one
[31:58] brother and he's coming back
[32:01] and there's a lot of questions I I can't
[32:04] stand
[32:06] in my righteous indignation I guess
[32:08] where you've got ministers and preachers
[32:11] that that if somebody is a little bit
[32:13] different in your church they just throw
[32:14] you out
[32:16] y'all been gone a long time ago
[32:19] that's what brother Dale said and Aaron
[32:21] said amen
[32:25] we're all different
[32:28] but being a being the economy of God we
[32:30] have differences we have differences of
[32:32] spirits we have not not Spirits as far
[32:34] as out there but spirit of discernment
[32:36] Spirit of Faith Spirit of speaking in
[32:38] tongue Spirit of interpretation Spirit
[32:40] of wisdom like we've been speaking
[32:41] before their Spirit of wisdom to come
[32:43] into the church we'll talk about that
[32:44] maybe a little bit more I want to break
[32:46] this down a little more in knowledge
[32:47] because if we don't know that we know
[32:49] that we know if we don't know that this
[32:51] is it
[32:53] nothing else this is it
[32:55] there's no other message coming there's
[32:58] no other method or no other plan this is
[33:01] it and if we don't get into it we're out
[33:03] of it
[33:05] just like the Inside Man Faith or doubt
[33:08] that's it
[33:10] and that's the plan of God is what to
[33:12] get you born again and then add to your
[33:15] new birth
[33:16] our Minister nourishment as we as
[33:18] brother Tam was speaking this weekend
[33:21] you know bringing the the Believers in
[33:24] and all the different things
[33:26] there's a lot of people believe a lot of
[33:28] things but there's got to be true
[33:29] believers
[33:31] because I'll promise you a good Catholic
[33:33] a good Catholic will fight you
[33:36] because they believe what they believe
[33:38] but remember the prophet of God said you
[33:41] can be sincere but you can be sincerely
[33:43] wrong
[33:44] well now listen we can't plead that
[33:46] ignorance here we can't pleading the
[33:47] ignorance in this message
[33:50] we've got the truth
[33:52] and the Bible says the truth will set
[33:53] you free why is it binding people
[33:56] why is it making people have problems
[33:58] and issues and all these things can't
[33:59] get to church can't do this can't do
[34:01] this can't do that
[34:04] have you ever thought about this I'm
[34:05] gonna go ahead and say I got it at the
[34:07] end of the sermon
[34:08] but you know we talk about all this we
[34:11] talked of it before
[34:12] about how your confession when you
[34:14] confess something
[34:16] you know in the Old Testament
[34:20] the high priest would take the blood
[34:23] and every that iPod or that
[34:27] um Thomas
[34:28] had all 12 tribes all 12 Stones was on
[34:31] that was on that birthplace
[34:34] so what he was doing is one man was
[34:37] walking into the holy of holies
[34:38] representing
[34:41] Natalie Levi all the different ones he
[34:45] was taking that in and representing
[34:47] every one of them for their sin and he
[34:52] was doing the confessing for the people
[34:55] not every you understand what I'm saying
[34:57] everybody from Nepali might have had
[34:59] this might have been a drunk this would
[35:00] have been whoremonger this would be this
[35:01] this would be that he'd have to list
[35:03] that in the Old Testament the
[35:05] requirement was that he would go in and
[35:08] say lord god Jehovah I have done here
[35:11] seven times what you told me to do and
[35:14] now we are doing everything you said now
[35:17] I am going to go tell the children of
[35:19] Israel when you like when that thing
[35:22] lights up and you accept
[35:25] that blood
[35:27] he's going to walk out and say for one
[35:29] more year you're forgiven so he was the
[35:32] high priest of their confession
[35:35] not knowing every confession they had
[35:37] but he confessed that he had all 12
[35:40] tribes and he brought them in under the
[35:42] blood and then he give it to God and
[35:45] said God you said this was going to be
[35:47] enough to cover their sin for one more
[35:49] year and God says I accept that because
[35:51] that's the way it was in the Torah when
[35:55] I told Moses to do what he's doing right
[35:58] what about me and you
[36:02] the high priest Caiaphas and all the
[36:04] different ones Aaron
[36:07] they weren't saved
[36:13] they were only confessing what you said
[36:18] Jesus can't be no different
[36:20] if you ever thought about this
[36:23] if you confess
[36:25] God is your high brief that takes that
[36:29] confession and takes it to God and says
[36:32] God you said if I would die for these
[36:34] people
[36:35] we know they're not two different people
[36:36] but I'm we're in an act of a play all
[36:38] right he takes those sins and he takes
[36:41] them before the father and he says they
[36:43] have confessed their sin they have
[36:46] confessed that by my stripes they were
[36:49] healed you said that you said you would
[36:52] heal them you said you would save them
[36:53] we haven't High priests as the Bible
[36:55] says they can go before God
[36:58] with a confession
[37:00] now do you know what he can't do
[37:05] I can't go past that you're perfect man
[37:07] I don't know what you're talking about I
[37:08] don't I don't know I can't get this I
[37:10] can't go to church I get all these
[37:12] problems and I got bills and I got this
[37:13] I got that you know Jesus Christ
[37:16] almighty God himself cannot
[37:18] take that confession to God
[37:24] ah
[37:25] he never will take a negative confession
[37:29] to the father
[37:32] come on people good Lord now stop then
[37:35] stop confessing negative
[37:37] stop it doesn't matter it doesn't matter
[37:39] if you're standing there with one day
[37:40] left to live
[37:42] I still say Jesus Christ you said you
[37:46] would heal me
[37:47] please take that to the father and We
[37:49] Know listen we know it's not
[37:50] trinitarianism but it is a way of
[37:52] getting to God right only way to the
[37:54] white father is through Jesus Christ
[37:57] so Jesus Takes your confession you know
[38:00] what he can't go and do say one thing
[38:02] you if you say something negative he
[38:04] can't take that to the god to God to the
[38:05] father
[38:07] he's the high priest though of your
[38:09] confession
[38:10] you confess
[38:12] I confess that we can make it up this
[38:15] statue of perfect man I confess that
[38:18] these things are working in our church
[38:19] they're working in our life they're
[38:20] working in our ministry they're working
[38:22] in our job they're working in our
[38:23] families
[38:24] I can see it
[38:27] working
[38:28] but what do you confess
[38:31] ah just wowzy wowzy woo
[38:34] Jesus Christ has never took wow as you
[38:36] woo to the father
[38:37] amen
[38:39] think about that next time we start
[38:41] [Music]
[38:42] what I always call it being bucket mouth
[38:44] you know get a little bucket and fill it
[38:46] full of Just Junk don't be bucket
[38:48] Matthew God can't he can only go by your
[38:50] confession
[38:54] think about that
[38:56] he cannot take a negative confession to
[38:59] God
[39:02] I can't never has went before the father
[39:06] now I can't went from you to Jesus
[39:08] Christ but he's never took that
[39:10] confession to the father so who stopped
[39:12] it Jesus no you did
[39:14] you stopped it
[39:16] this is not the power of positive
[39:18] thinking this is what God told us to do
[39:20] he said come bowling before the throne
[39:21] of grace he said I am the high priest
[39:23] that can be touched by the feeling of
[39:26] your infirmities that knows that he was
[39:28] one-time Spirit God that could not feel
[39:30] pain but he became a human so that he
[39:33] can feel pain he became the son of man
[39:35] so he could die for me and you he became
[39:38] the son of man so he could take the
[39:39] stripes for me and you and he could take
[39:41] the nails and he could die
[39:43] for me and you
[39:46] amen so let's quit doing this negative
[39:48] stuff your confession will never go to
[39:52] God negative confessions never will make
[39:55] it to God
[39:59] praise the Lord
[40:03] one day y'all gonna get happy about
[40:05] stuff
[40:06] and I hope it just don't just explode
[40:13] and brother Brown tells us let's
[40:15] continue on but that's that's what we're
[40:16] looking at all right look our soul
[40:19] that's the ark that's where that's where
[40:21] what was in the ark what's in that art
[40:23] the word of God
[40:25] the word of God in two tables of stone
[40:27] were placed in that Ark and that's what
[40:30] God would you had to go into that Ark
[40:33] spread the blood sprinkle the blood and
[40:35] then that's how you talk to God not you
[40:37] but the high priest talked to God is
[40:39] through that art because it was whatever
[40:41] God put in there remember we went to it
[40:43] before the word of God the rod that
[40:44] budded and something else was in there I
[40:47] can't remember them but oh the shoe
[40:48] bread so that was all what God Said to
[40:51] put in there he put it in there Aaron
[40:54] and whoever the high priest said well
[40:56] I'm going to go in and this is what you
[40:58] told me to do Lord if you told me to do
[40:59] this you'll forgive their sins well
[41:01] let's do the same thing Jesus Christ you
[41:03] told me you'd forgive me of my sins
[41:05] Jesus Christ you told me you would heal
[41:07] me you told me you'd deliver me you told
[41:09] me you would help me up to Statue of
[41:12] perfect man now I take that before the
[41:14] father oh you take that before the
[41:16] father
[41:17] and let him confess
[41:19] a positive confession
[41:22] so now let's get started everybody with
[41:24] me
[41:25] positive confession
[41:29] they'll be all right with that
[41:30] think about that
[41:32] we stop our own self we know that but in
[41:34] that analogy you see how you stop
[41:36] yourself why am I not getting anything
[41:39] you're not approaching right
[41:41] your approach is not right to God
[41:45] all right let's go to let's go here and
[41:47] look at this they got it over there okay
[41:49] I won't need the chart anymore if you
[41:51] want to pull them back up over there we
[41:53] appreciate everybody in the back doing
[41:54] their job and the ones that are standing
[41:56] in for the ones that are not here
[41:57] tonight we really appreciate that
[42:00] now what was brother Ryan we talked
[42:01] about this plan the prophet of God what
[42:04] was he here to do
[42:05] and here
[42:11] brother Brown didn't come to make a
[42:13] bride
[42:14] there's bride down through the church
[42:16] ages many many more that's going to be
[42:18] in the message
[42:23] brother Brown didn't come to tell us
[42:25] that there's a new way again born again
[42:30] he come to tell us what the word said
[42:32] straight out of God's mouth is what he
[42:34] come to tell us
[42:36] and then we keep getting out of line and
[42:38] these as we see this analogy for brother
[42:40] Romans and our analogy it's a vision
[42:41] that he saw that they were doing good
[42:43] you know the first group came by then
[42:45] the middle group came by and the middle
[42:46] group was just naked and and prancing
[42:49] around the worldly church and he was
[42:52] like oh my God is this all I've done is
[42:54] this all I've got
[42:56] but the angel says look that bride's
[42:58] going to come back again in the end time
[43:00] in other words he's coming she's coming
[43:02] in the end time as the Omega bride but
[43:06] the bride comes twice the church comes
[43:08] one time
[43:09] what are you telling us this for
[43:12] there's our preview
[43:16] remember the first preview of The Bride
[43:19] was the early church age amen
[43:22] that was these virtues this listen folks
[43:25] this is not new second Peter wrote it 2
[43:29] 000 years ago
[43:30] he just took a profit to put it together
[43:33] so that we can live it
[43:36] they lived those in the first church
[43:37] days they didn't need a quote book or a
[43:40] statue of perfect man message
[43:43] they listened to Peter they look at
[43:45] James they looked at John they looked at
[43:47] Peter they looked at their lives
[43:49] they said oh they've got brotherly
[43:50] kindness they've got godliness they got
[43:52] patience
[43:53] and then one day Peter says now with
[43:55] inspiration he says add to your faith
[43:57] virtue
[43:58] and to your virtue knowledge and to your
[44:01] knowledge Temperance patience
[44:06] well they didn't listen to that
[44:09] foreign
[44:10] the bride became a church
[44:13] to a degree
[44:15] Through the Ages through the Dark Ages
[44:16] but again here comes the second bride
[44:20] the Bride Comes in twice see right here
[44:23] not knowing it but look at my message
[44:25] this morning he's talking about the
[44:27] bride the seed fell on the ground and I
[44:29] see her that was the original seed and
[44:30] she come through the process of these
[44:32] denominations which look only comes into
[44:34] existence once remember brother Brown
[44:37] said you ever denominate you die
[44:39] you denominate you die so you're dead
[44:41] and they're dead they're not coming back
[44:43] listen all that's going on in Ashbury
[44:46] and all the different places praise God
[44:48] because listen if somebody gets healed
[44:50] if somebody gets saved if somebody tries
[44:53] to live a better life praise God if
[44:55] it'll fill the church up praise God
[44:58] but they don't have the full word of God
[45:01] they do not have the completeness of the
[45:05] second bride that we're talking about
[45:06] here this is the completeness of the
[45:09] second brother
[45:10] that's the reason she was reviewed the
[45:13] second time see when brother Branham
[45:15] came on Earth
[45:16] when the message came let's just put it
[45:18] that way when the message came
[45:20] and brother Brown started revealing the
[45:22] the mysteries of God
[45:24] 1963 the seals and different ones that's
[45:26] your perfect man she's not there with a
[45:28] shock
[45:29] um serpent seed uh and all the
[45:31] restoration of Brier tree all these
[45:33] different ones
[45:34] what was he doing
[45:36] he was clearing away all of that junk
[45:38] that was in the in the Middle Ages the
[45:40] church because remember he didn't call
[45:42] his church anymore he called his bride
[45:45] and his brother Tim was saying this this
[45:47] uh yesterday or Saturday Sunday
[45:50] that girl that was the armor meat
[45:52] packing girl
[45:54] those other three Got a Blessing they
[45:56] loved them God they loved it they wanted
[45:57] them they wanted they were happy they
[45:59] wanted to get ready but there was only
[46:01] one got a message one got a promise I'm
[46:04] coming back for you I'm not coming back
[46:06] for them three
[46:07] I'm coming I'm not coming back for a
[46:08] Trinity I'm coming back for one
[46:12] and you know what he did
[46:15] that's what I'm going to say today he
[46:17] did everything he said he'd do he did
[46:19] and he will do
[46:22] and she was perfectly the second time
[46:24] like she was the first time oh God have
[46:26] mercy hurry hurry life get in the grain
[46:28] right quick all others never appeared no
[46:33] more
[46:34] they went out never to come back again
[46:36] but the bride came back because she was
[46:38] Alpha and Omega God the great sculptor
[46:41] remembered the plan the plan Master he
[46:44] was making a masterpiece listen you
[46:46] can't be a masterpiece and be false
[46:49] you can't be a god Masterpiece and be
[46:51] false
[46:52] amen
[46:54] the only thing with the with the analogy
[46:56] of the Michelangelo was that the flaw
[46:59] made it the made it the Masterpiece well
[47:01] that flaw was I flesh
[47:04] but once you get rid of that we are the
[47:06] total Masterpiece of God there's not a
[47:09] piece missing anywhere
[47:12] he's made him a masterpiece for us a
[47:14] piece of his own or his first
[47:16] masterpiece
[47:17] restoration of the Bright Tree we'll
[47:19] talk about four Messengers we'll get to
[47:20] that real quick because we know if we've
[47:22] been here long enough we've got enough
[47:23] knowledge we know that there was four
[47:26] deaf Messengers that killed this tree
[47:28] and four life Messengers that brought it
[47:30] back what was the first Martin Luther
[47:32] justification
[47:33] sanctification this is now this is
[47:35] coming up to that second preview of The
[47:37] Bride
[47:39] now about with me this is coming up to
[47:40] that second preview of the bride all
[47:42] right
[47:43] what was the third Pentecost with the
[47:45] restoration of the gifts the Holy Ghost
[47:47] baptism of the Holy Ghost what was the
[47:48] fourth the word
[47:51] the word
[47:53] all right there were four great prophets
[47:55] one of them Martin Luther began to shine
[47:57] light it was a little light very small
[47:59] strength of justification but listen
[48:01] they were bright but they had a little
[48:03] piece missing out
[48:04] a couple of pieces couple of doctrines
[48:07] of water baptism a couple of doctrines
[48:09] of probably well they did believe in
[48:12] eternal hell they they took a lot Luther
[48:13] took a lot of those Catholic doctrines
[48:15] you know that
[48:19] he came out of that though
[48:21] and God shined a light on Luther
[48:23] then Wesley said no it needs to be
[48:25] stronger than that uh
[48:28] brother Luther we can't sit in the pub
[48:30] anymore and drink beer and talk about
[48:32] God we got to come out of that all right
[48:34] we got to come to sanctification clean
[48:37] and set aside for service then after
[48:39] Wesley comes stronger than him
[48:40] Pentecostal the baptism of holy ghost in
[48:43] other words what in another great
[48:44] prophet the gifts came into the church
[48:46] the Holy Ghost fell on 1906 Azusa Street
[48:49] and there was a Revival
[48:51] a Revival of the gifts that was bringing
[48:53] the gifts back into the church
[48:55] but in the last day of Malachi for
[48:57] Elijah's to come with the very word of
[48:59] God because remember back down here
[49:02] where we just talked about Pentecostals
[49:03] they were trinitarians they still had a
[49:06] piece missing
[49:09] they believed in a trinity they believed
[49:11] then father son Holy Ghost baptism peace
[49:13] is missing listen we got to get the
[49:15] pieces back together we got to get to
[49:16] brother Ram called them the loose ends
[49:18] in other words there was a strand of
[49:19] doctrine that was in God's mind that was
[49:21] totally pure and man comes and starts
[49:24] cutting pieces out of it well here comes
[49:26] the prophet of God and he starts putting
[49:28] the pieces back together here comes
[49:29] Elijah going to build his what to build
[49:32] the altar back together to tell us how
[49:34] to get to God not just tell us how to
[49:36] get a new birth
[49:38] that's been preached since Martin Luther
[49:39] I believe Martin Luther preached to just
[49:41] shall live by faith but he preaches hey
[49:43] you got to be born again
[49:44] you've got to be changed you got to come
[49:46] out of that Catholic system
[49:48] Wesley said you got to be born again
[49:50] plus you gotta live it
[49:53] you can't go in a pub
[49:55] can't do what you used to do then the
[49:57] baptism of my Holy Ghost listen it
[49:59] cleaned a lot of people up it gave them
[50:01] the Holy Ghost and it just not just give
[50:03] it to their soul and anointed their
[50:05] flesh will they speak in tongues Great
[50:07] Mighty Miracles was going on during that
[50:09] time all right so that was and then see
[50:11] then brother Bradham had a platform to
[50:13] step out on
[50:14] god with the gift of God that he had
[50:17] that he would have never lasted in
[50:19] Wesley or Luther's age
[50:22] they couldn't have took it
[50:24] but coming out of the Pentecostal realm
[50:26] coming they what they came with him well
[50:28] some did some stayed there but but he
[50:30] said the Pentecost was the only ones
[50:32] that would what that would claim him in
[50:34] other words in other words it would let
[50:35] him preach him preaching many Wesleyan
[50:37] churches he didn't preach in any many
[50:39] Methodist churches because they didn't
[50:41] want him anymore because of his Doctrine
[50:43] but in the last days the evening
[50:45] lightness to come forth to restore and
[50:47] bring back and turn the hearts of the
[50:48] children we've been preaching that a
[50:49] long time ago four Killers took it four
[50:53] Messengers destroyed it or The
[50:55] Messengers The Devil destroyed it and in
[50:58] four matches of righteousness restored
[50:59] her back again prophesy son of man can
[51:02] these bones live
[51:04] look the life only come remember there
[51:06] was all the stages of putting this
[51:07] together and putting that together and
[51:09] they were there
[51:10] but they weren't moving they had no life
[51:13] in them
[51:14] you and I listen let's don't let Satan
[51:16] suck the life out of us
[51:19] he's sucking the life out of some of us
[51:22] he can't do that anymore we rebuke him
[51:24] in the name of the Lord Jesus take that
[51:27] to the profession of the father That
[51:29] We're Not Gonna cower down to that
[51:31] anymore
[51:33] but the life only come not when the
[51:35] senior skin was on it
[51:39] but when the wind blowed on it
[51:41] that's when come back that fourth
[51:43] message
[51:44] of life I will restore saith the Lord
[51:47] praise God the fourth light is to come
[51:49] who is he talking about his message
[51:53] the fourth was the word itself the word
[51:55] made flesh
[51:57] proves of the proof of the Resurrection
[51:59] signed that Christ has finally look
[52:01] finally after justification has been
[52:04] planted sanctification been planted
[52:05] baptism the Holy Ghost organizations
[52:07] died out you know what not one
[52:09] organization quit well brother Brown was
[52:11] alive and not one organization has quit
[52:13] since they have absolutely multiplied
[52:17] so that means only a certain group of
[52:19] people is going to ever hear of the true
[52:21] message of the hour
[52:23] all right
[52:25] organizations died out in crisis against
[52:27] censored himself like the cap of the
[52:29] pyramid look at the top first line
[52:31] justification sanctification baptism the
[52:32] whole ghost incoming of the cap what is
[52:34] it that Holy Ghost Bunch being honed
[52:36] said holy ghost up at the top that's not
[52:39] the baptism the Holy Ghost to make you
[52:40] born again that's the baptism of my Holy
[52:42] Ghost to put you into
[52:44] a Powerhouse
[52:47] of God
[52:49] it'll fit with the same kind of ministry
[52:51] he had when he went away now listen
[52:54] the same kind of ministry that when
[52:56] Jesus left 2000 years ago that Ministry
[52:59] has never hit the earth like it was then
[53:00] until now
[53:02] it has that's why it's called the son of
[53:04] man
[53:06] in the end time it was God made manifest
[53:09] in a form called Jesus now it's God made
[53:11] manifest in a form called a bride that
[53:13] we have his mind we have his as brother
[53:17] Rob says his potential we don't listen
[53:19] we don't have the potential to preach
[53:21] the truth we have the truth
[53:26] listen God was is not wisdom he's not
[53:29] getting wisdom
[53:34] God's not getting anything me and you're
[53:36] the ones are supposed to be getting it
[53:40] when he comes back it'll catch the whole
[53:42] thing in a Rapture justify Sanctified
[53:44] baptism in the Holy Ghost that pyramid
[53:45] will stand again I believe today it's
[53:47] standing today if you'll realize where
[53:50] you are and why you're here and why
[53:52] you're listening to the word of God like
[53:54] you are or not
[53:56] right you get both
[53:58] the house of God will live again the
[54:01] tree of life is growing again
[54:04] this kind of struck me a few minutes ago
[54:07] read it long time ago and I read it
[54:09] again
[54:11] there was a man
[54:13] in Ezekiel they had a line in his hand
[54:16] and he went Eastward
[54:19] Direction means a lot
[54:22] who's coming from the Eastern Gate who's
[54:24] coming from the East right
[54:27] he measured a thousand cubics and he
[54:29] brought me through the waters
[54:32] in other words he stepped a little bit
[54:34] further out
[54:35] brother George it was to his ankles
[54:37] he could walk
[54:39] he could still have issues going on in
[54:41] the upper parts of his body
[54:43] but he didn't stop
[54:45] he brought me through the water
[54:48] and the waters were to the knees
[54:50] a little bit more
[54:53] again he measured a thousand and brought
[54:55] me through in the water to the loins
[54:57] oh it's getting
[54:59] swam now you couldn't swim in that ankle
[55:01] deep water you couldn't swim in the need
[55:03] to eat water kind of hard for brother
[55:05] Donnie to swim in water up to the loins
[55:08] he needs one about 10 foot deep for him
[55:10] to get in and get wet
[55:12] but the water to the loins and look
[55:14] afterwards he measured a thousand and it
[55:16] was a river that I could not pass over
[55:19] now remember let's connect this to the
[55:21] dream that sister Shepard had what was
[55:23] the dream about it was about water it
[55:25] was about her asking God if she was born
[55:28] again and God showed him a Great Pyramid
[55:32] and brother Brown was on top he cut the
[55:33] top out of it he had a he had a box
[55:35] setting up there remember he poured
[55:37] honey and it could wouldn't keep water
[55:38] but once he got it to keep water what
[55:40] was it the water came out and went down
[55:43] and went through sister Shepard into her
[55:45] feet
[55:46] so that's why me and you with this
[55:47] statue of perfect man listen it's a
[55:50] river it says I could not pass over for
[55:52] the waters were risen Waters to swim in
[55:55] a river that could not be passed over
[55:57] and watch what he said Son of Man hast
[56:00] thou seen this
[56:03] then he brought me and caused me to
[56:05] return back
[56:06] to the river
[56:10] justification
[56:12] sanctification
[56:14] baptism of the Holy Ghost to the loins
[56:18] he said hang on to me
[56:20] we got something else to do
[56:22] so he said go back now we don't go
[56:24] backwards in God but what's he trying to
[56:25] bring he's bringing the word
[56:28] he's bringing the word of God so watch
[56:31] I just kind of caught this the other day
[56:33] and I want to kind of share it with you
[56:34] then he brought me and caused me to
[56:36] return to the brink of the river so he
[56:37] caused him to come back
[56:39] to where he started
[56:40] how many times have we said
[56:41] justifications education baptismal Holy
[56:43] Ghost and you got to come back and go
[56:44] through justification baptism Holy Ghost
[56:46] then you got to come back and go through
[56:47] justification the higher form of
[56:49] justification higher form of
[56:50] sanctification that's the higher form of
[56:53] the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's
[56:54] what he's telling us right here in this
[56:55] in this Vision now I returned it to Bank
[56:58] of the river there were many trees
[57:03] there was life
[57:04] on that River
[57:06] that was life in the word of God
[57:09] then he said unto me these Waters issue
[57:12] out toward the East Country and go down
[57:14] into the desert how many of you been in
[57:16] the desert before
[57:18] but it's coming through your desert and
[57:20] going to the Sea which being brought
[57:22] forth into the sea the waters shall be
[57:25] healed
[57:27] and it shall come to pass that
[57:29] everything that liveth
[57:31] remember watch the fourth stage life
[57:37] breathe
[57:40] that everything that liveth which moveth
[57:43] whether so ever the river shall come
[57:45] shall live
[57:47] get in the word of God and you will live
[57:52] then it talks about great multitude of
[57:54] fish because these Waters shall come
[57:56] through the what huge for they shall be
[57:58] healed in everything shall live whether
[58:01] cometh everywhere that River's at
[58:04] there's a River of Life
[58:07] flowing out what from me
[58:09] make the lame to walk and the blind to
[58:12] see
[58:14] wow
[58:19] listen to this
[58:24] trying to get you to a point this is
[58:26] what the statue of perfect meant it's
[58:27] not just that you're not
[58:29] it's the plan of God
[58:33] and we cannot go around it
[58:36] we got to go into it
[58:38] the reason they call Jesus Bells above a
[58:40] devil because you see he could discern
[58:42] the thoughts of their mind
[58:43] see but he was the word of God
[58:46] and Hebrews 4 said the word of God is
[58:47] sharper than to edge sword even
[58:49] Discerning of the thoughts we're going
[58:51] to get to knowledge Maybe
[58:53] see he was the word The Living Word now
[58:56] watch he was the Living Word comes into
[58:58] who
[59:01] us and does the same thing
[59:05] has the same effect on us when are we
[59:08] going to realize that
[59:11] the Lord Jesus never took a negative
[59:13] confession to the father
[59:17] it does the same effect on Earth see
[59:19] same because it's the same word it's the
[59:21] same thing among us and that's the way
[59:23] sometimes those who are not in that
[59:24] bracket speak with tongues and another
[59:26] one interprets what is it the word made
[59:28] flesh again among us
[59:31] Christianity versus Idols in 1961 we are
[59:34] made for takers of his Holiness we In
[59:37] His Image we are living images of a
[59:41] living God
[59:42] then dead to self raised with him now
[59:45] listen his word made flesh again in US
[59:50] oh brother Neville look what is it not
[59:53] the mythical imaginary God sitting out
[59:55] there but the Living God what is the
[59:57] Living God the word in you
[1:00:00] making itself real
[1:00:02] glory to God
[1:00:03] oh I know you think I'm a Holy Roller
[1:00:05] maybe I am
[1:00:06] but brother do you see it
[1:00:08] triumph over every denomination triumph
[1:00:11] over all paganism a living God made
[1:00:13] manifest in a living Temple and
[1:00:15] everybody's going yes we know that's you
[1:00:17] brother Bynum yes we know that's you
[1:00:19] brother around yes oh yeah the Great
[1:00:21] Mighty signs and wonders and miracles
[1:00:22] yes brother Branham and we can't do it
[1:00:24] so we're gonna have to wait on you to
[1:00:25] come back
[1:00:26] baloney
[1:00:28] that's not the word of God
[1:00:31] ain't gonna happen if you wait till
[1:00:32] brother Ram gets here you lost
[1:00:35] because when he gets here
[1:00:38] we're already sealed in
[1:00:41] we don't need another ceiling we're
[1:00:42] already sealed down
[1:00:44] and the word of God with God look the
[1:00:46] word of God which
[1:00:51] Heavenly places triumphed over all
[1:00:54] things in Christ Jesus now that was
[1:00:56] 1961 what about
[1:00:59] 2023 we've got to have more fervor we've
[1:01:02] got to have more
[1:01:05] you say oh fight for no peace with God
[1:01:08] like we're going to talk in a minute
[1:01:09] maybe patience with God that's what
[1:01:12] brother Brown said first thing I do have
[1:01:13] patience with God now that patience with
[1:01:15] you brother have patience with God
[1:01:18] I like what brother Brown said he said
[1:01:20] you know they come up to Noah and they
[1:01:22] locked him in there for seven days God
[1:01:23] didn't see go get an arcs he's going to
[1:01:25] rain number day number six he's like
[1:01:27] come on Noah daddy you uh
[1:01:32] he ain't looking good ain't a cloud in
[1:01:34] the sky you said it's gonna rain
[1:01:36] he said
[1:01:37] God said so and that's what's going to
[1:01:39] happen
[1:01:40] and guess what it did it happened
[1:01:43] tell me my brother my sister when was
[1:01:45] the time that the sons of God was ever
[1:01:47] to be made manifest outside of this time
[1:01:49] now
[1:01:51] right now
[1:01:54] when were there ever a time in history
[1:01:56] that manifests the time to deliver all
[1:01:59] nature nature the nature itself is
[1:02:02] groaning waiting for the time of
[1:02:04] manifestation you heard about that other
[1:02:06] earthquake earthquake in turkey again
[1:02:08] another one right one right after the
[1:02:09] other
[1:02:12] it's because the world's waiting on me
[1:02:14] and you
[1:02:15] the world is feeling the pull and it's
[1:02:17] pulling this thing apart
[1:02:19] but with me and you though it's pushing
[1:02:21] us back together
[1:02:22] because we're pressurized for this time
[1:02:24] we're either we are or we're not
[1:02:27] why before the atonement was made before
[1:02:29] the Holy Ghost was ever poured out all
[1:02:31] the Old Testament on down there couldn't
[1:02:32] have been manifestation wow
[1:02:36] that's a mouthful brother George take a
[1:02:38] Moses
[1:02:40] Noah
[1:02:42] Ena
[1:02:44] Isaiah
[1:02:46] David
[1:02:49] all these great men that we Revere
[1:02:52] in the Old Testament
[1:02:56] they couldn't manifest the sons of God
[1:02:58] like we do
[1:03:00] no that's what he says
[1:03:03] it had to wait till this time
[1:03:05] now all things has been brought coming
[1:03:07] shaping up to a headstone to the
[1:03:10] manifestation of sons of God coming back
[1:03:12] and the spirit of God coming into what
[1:03:14] these men
[1:03:16] not in these buttons
[1:03:20] if I get up
[1:03:22] press play
[1:03:27] until until their Ministry
[1:03:30] will be so close like Christ who will
[1:03:32] join him and his church together there's
[1:03:34] a Ministry being preached now
[1:03:37] that's bringing us together and then
[1:03:39] this thought just come Roll to Me I had
[1:03:41] that quote the other day but this one
[1:03:43] come right behind it I was thinking
[1:03:44] about it yesterday watch this
[1:03:47] we we love to preach about the seals we
[1:03:49] know what the seals are we have
[1:03:51] knowledge of what they are but do you
[1:03:52] know when they're going to break well we
[1:03:54] know when the sixth Hill is going to
[1:03:55] break six seal is going to break in its
[1:03:57] natural form when the two prophets are
[1:03:59] over in Israel and they're going to call
[1:04:01] down fire earthquakes whatever they can
[1:04:04] do but remember there's a six seal
[1:04:06] sanctification that's got to come to me
[1:04:07] and you before our body has changed
[1:04:10] and it will change our body that six
[1:04:12] Seal A disruption of nature what do you
[1:04:15] think this is
[1:04:18] you got some virtue but it ain't Godly
[1:04:21] I'm just saying
[1:04:22] you've got some knowledge listen we're
[1:04:24] full of knowledge
[1:04:27] well if I had my phone I show you
[1:04:30] pull up any word you want to and there
[1:04:31] it is
[1:04:33] Quick Knowledge too not one well I mean
[1:04:35] I get home and I'll look at the computer
[1:04:36] and no it's in your phone actually it's
[1:04:39] in Donnie's watch right there on his arm
[1:04:41] so we got plenty of knowledge
[1:04:44] I don't know about temperance
[1:04:47] but we do have some certain ones of
[1:04:49] these godliness we listen Luther was a
[1:04:52] Godly Man
[1:04:53] Wesley was a Godly Man for his time
[1:04:59] that's what it was worth just name all
[1:05:01] the ones that are not brother Branham
[1:05:02] because we always put him up you know
[1:05:04] and that's okay because we do
[1:05:06] but there's all these other great men
[1:05:08] that were great but they didn't have
[1:05:10] everything together
[1:05:13] you and I have everything together
[1:05:15] because the Sixth Seal is going to open
[1:05:17] with two prophets over there but when's
[1:05:19] the six year going to open to me and you
[1:05:20] it's going to open on this side
[1:05:22] and the sixth open of The Sixth Seal is
[1:05:24] a disruption of nature it takes your
[1:05:26] nature what your what Your what you're
[1:05:30] comfortable with
[1:05:34] it's going to take what you're
[1:05:35] comfortable with and tear it out
[1:05:38] and throw it away
[1:05:40] smash it
[1:05:43] tell you it's wrong right
[1:05:46] tell you not to hate your neighbor
[1:05:48] tell you not to hate your brother if you
[1:05:49] spoke bad on bad of
[1:05:52] folks that's against your nature
[1:05:55] being patient is against your nature
[1:06:01] laodicea is against your nature
[1:06:08] prophet of God tells us his power over
[1:06:10] the waters turn them to blood Smite the
[1:06:12] Earth with plays that was Moses what is
[1:06:14] it what can bring these things to look
[1:06:16] what can breathe these things but what
[1:06:18] the word
[1:06:21] right the word
[1:06:23] the word's only thing is going to bring
[1:06:24] us back to this the words the only thing
[1:06:26] that's going to cause we were talking we
[1:06:28] had a real good time that we had some
[1:06:30] questions and answers on Sunday about
[1:06:32] different things about earthquakes and
[1:06:33] stuff and Resurrection
[1:06:36] um listen when we come to the end of
[1:06:38] this thing I just believe that according
[1:06:39] to brother Brandon if they're going to
[1:06:41] have the six seal open and it's in its
[1:06:43] natural form then we're going to have a
[1:06:44] sick still open in the spiritual form
[1:06:46] and we're going to be able to maybe have
[1:06:48] a hamburger when we need it they ain't
[1:06:51] got no money to pay for it
[1:06:54] at least we already know that happens go
[1:06:56] go talk to brother
[1:06:58] um go talk to uh good grief
[1:07:00] what's the black brother used to go to
[1:07:02] church here
[1:07:03] huh
[1:07:04] brother Harris
[1:07:07] poor family sitting around the table
[1:07:09] didn't have nothing to eat
[1:07:12] say God we need something to eat
[1:07:15] whatever how many of them were sitting
[1:07:16] there the pork chops come out of the sky
[1:07:18] and hitting their plate
[1:07:20] yeah
[1:07:21] you said that Kate well you can go argue
[1:07:24] with brother Harris
[1:07:26] well the Harris was stuck out on side of
[1:07:27] the road one day and his car wasn't
[1:07:28] cranking he realized he didn't have no
[1:07:30] gas remember the story
[1:07:32] he said God I got to get back home
[1:07:35] I can't get stuck out here on the
[1:07:37] interstate lord said get back in the car
[1:07:39] and go home he said I got back in the
[1:07:40] car and drove 40 miles back to the house
[1:07:42] empty with no gas in the car
[1:07:46] storms we've seen spoke out of existence
[1:07:48] all these different things we've seen
[1:07:50] pieces of it but brother Brown said you
[1:07:52] wait till it starts firing you wait till
[1:07:54] some sister gets all anointed by the
[1:07:56] Holy Ghost come on somebody and then she
[1:07:59] starts looking at her kids and saying
[1:08:01] hey that's what I want that's the one I
[1:08:03] want Lord I want that girl in the church
[1:08:05] I want that girl saved
[1:08:09] I want my husband feel with the Holy
[1:08:11] Ghost
[1:08:12] you say you're talking crazy thank you
[1:08:17] they're the ones who brings on this six
[1:08:19] sea of what two anointed prophets
[1:08:22] Anointed with the Holy Ghost
[1:08:24] not manifested sons of God
[1:08:29] we are the ones that are the manifested
[1:08:31] sons of God where God speaks to us but
[1:08:33] he will speak in three and a half years
[1:08:35] through these two prophets look they
[1:08:38] uncover and open it up it's the power of
[1:08:41] God to interrupt nature this is the
[1:08:45] power of God today tonight any other
[1:08:48] time this is the power of God to
[1:08:49] interrupt your nature and change you in
[1:08:52] a moment it's going to Columbus we
[1:08:54] cannot get changed like we are now
[1:08:59] it's the power of God to interrupt
[1:09:01] nature see The Sixth Seal is completely
[1:09:03] an interruption of your nature it's a
[1:09:06] complete Interruption of the nature of
[1:09:09] the ball of Earth you're standing on but
[1:09:11] it's also the ball of Earth you living
[1:09:12] in
[1:09:14] and the only way you can do it is to go
[1:09:16] up the statue of perfect man that's why
[1:09:17] this is so ill-taught we've got to have
[1:09:21] these we can't just say
[1:09:24] we're God
[1:09:27] listen that ain't part of the plan
[1:09:30] if it was part of the plan like that
[1:09:33] Peter would wait had wasted his time
[1:09:36] right in second Peter
[1:09:38] add to your Facebook add
[1:09:41] and after this at
[1:09:44] did you get it there's your seal who
[1:09:46] does it it's the prophets on the other
[1:09:48] side of the Rapture he's talking about
[1:09:49] when we're gone with the power of God
[1:09:51] unless they've got the power of God the
[1:09:53] word of God they just condemn nature I
[1:09:55] say tonight condemn that nature you live
[1:09:58] with condemn that thing you can't get
[1:10:00] over condemn that thing that you're
[1:10:02] walking around with that you need to get
[1:10:03] rid of condemn it give it to Jesus
[1:10:06] Christ and let it take it say I'm done
[1:10:07] with it
[1:10:08] they didn't take you to the father
[1:10:11] he's not going to take it to the father
[1:10:12] any other way
[1:10:14] they can send earthquakes turn the moon
[1:10:16] into blood the sun can go down or
[1:10:18] anything it's their command amen there
[1:10:20] you are there you are see how the sealed
[1:10:22] open down there in the church ages how
[1:10:24] it showed the martyrs now here's these
[1:10:26] two prophets standing here with the word
[1:10:27] of God to do anything to Nature they
[1:10:30] want to
[1:10:32] listen it's the same Holy Ghost that's
[1:10:34] in their mouth it's the same Holy Ghost
[1:10:36] that's in your soul right now if you're
[1:10:37] born again
[1:10:40] what's the difference they've got one
[1:10:42] group to preach to they got to get 144
[1:10:44] 000 saved listen you and I got to get
[1:10:46] saved Sanctified filled with the Holy
[1:10:48] Ghost and Anointed with them that's your
[1:10:51] perfect man Anointed with the same
[1:10:55] well you want whatever you want to say
[1:10:56] manifestations of God or or you can say
[1:10:59] character of God
[1:11:01] because what is character it's your
[1:11:02] nature
[1:11:03] so it's disrupting our nature
[1:11:06] see what is the Sixth Seal it's those
[1:11:08] two
[1:11:09] Prophets
[1:11:11] but you're not going to have to have
[1:11:13] knowledge to understand this
[1:11:15] Holy Ghost knowledge
[1:11:17] listen do you say it at night and wonder
[1:11:19] whether this is right or not
[1:11:26] I mean do you
[1:11:29] do you wonder where the gods around you
[1:11:31] or with you or talking to you
[1:11:35] yeah sometimes because I ain't spoke to
[1:11:37] me in the past month well it's your
[1:11:40] fault not his
[1:11:42] you doing something wrong not him you
[1:11:45] can't blame God
[1:11:49] so the word knowledge let's go through
[1:11:53] it real quick
[1:11:54] it's such as belongs to the more
[1:11:56] advanced and we'll get it because
[1:11:57] remember knowledge of wisdom is pretty
[1:11:58] much the same thing because brother
[1:12:00] Brown tells us the spirit of wisdom is
[1:12:01] going to come back into the church in
[1:12:03] the end time that's the spirit that's
[1:12:04] coming
[1:12:06] Spirit of wisdom all right especially if
[1:12:09] things lawful and unlawful for
[1:12:10] Christians moral wisdom such as insane
[1:12:13] and right living
[1:12:14] now looks way back here in the early
[1:12:16] church age we were talking about this
[1:12:18] the other day we know one thing's for
[1:12:19] sure that everything's so intertwined
[1:12:21] together the false Vine got intertwined
[1:12:24] around the True Vine listen this is
[1:12:26] where the separation begins
[1:12:28] right there
[1:12:31] that just came to me the other day there
[1:12:33] is your separating line that is your
[1:12:36] untwining of the spirits that are twined
[1:12:39] together
[1:12:40] are intertwined brother Brown says
[1:12:42] around the True Vine we find these Deeds
[1:12:44] of Nick listen God uh nobody but God can
[1:12:47] live this
[1:12:49] right Satan can't live this he can have
[1:12:50] his worldly knowledge and he have his
[1:12:52] worldly of this and worldly that and
[1:12:54] worldly power of worldly virtue
[1:12:57] you've probably got a lot of temperance
[1:12:58] too
[1:13:00] but not Holy Ghost knowledge
[1:13:02] he does not have and can't get these
[1:13:05] virtues
[1:13:08] then thirdly you add knowledge now that
[1:13:10] don't mean worldly knowledge because
[1:13:11] it's foolishness to God but knowledge to
[1:13:13] judge
[1:13:14] what judge right from wrong
[1:13:17] sit down and open the word of God if you
[1:13:19] can't understand something say God you
[1:13:22] know bro Joe Forney he was a illiterate
[1:13:25] brother
[1:13:26] didn't go to school
[1:13:28] he sat down one day and he said God he
[1:13:30] got saved he said God
[1:13:32] uh sister Vanessa have to read to him
[1:13:34] say God if you want me if you calling me
[1:13:36] to preach and if you calling me to to
[1:13:37] read this word of God and become a
[1:13:39] Christian you got to teach me how to
[1:13:41] read
[1:13:42] he said he started looking at those
[1:13:44] words and he said he said I could hear
[1:13:45] them
[1:13:47] bespoke because if you can't read you
[1:13:50] can't you say that word but when he can
[1:13:51] see that the scripture is not
[1:13:52] contradictory if you didn't know that
[1:13:54] that's just a bunch of words on the page
[1:13:56] your brain inside of your head can't say
[1:13:59] but when you can see much less
[1:14:01] understand what's going on
[1:14:04] he was just able to read words and then
[1:14:06] all of a sudden God put those words
[1:14:07] together
[1:14:09] God did not some teacher listen all of
[1:14:11] us got most of us got taught by a
[1:14:13] teacher a natural teacher but he got
[1:14:15] taught by God how to how to read
[1:14:18] amen well who was that somebody the
[1:14:20] other day was telling that same thing
[1:14:22] with playing a piano Lord I want to play
[1:14:24] the piano remember he said to give you
[1:14:25] the desire of your heart
[1:14:27] Lord I want to play the piano
[1:14:31] go over there sit down
[1:14:33] whoever it was and said it just felt
[1:14:35] like somebody was moving my fingers for
[1:14:37] me
[1:14:38] when he said then I got to where I could
[1:14:40] play and it just became natural what
[1:14:42] that wasn't no natural teacher that
[1:14:44] talked thought about it it was what's a
[1:14:46] fulfillment of the desire of somebody's
[1:14:48] heart
[1:14:49] but when you can see that the scripture
[1:14:51] is not contradictory that you can say
[1:14:53] that and can see by what Revelation the
[1:14:57] whole word is wrote in Mysteries and
[1:14:58] only the knowledge of God can reveal it
[1:15:01] why in the world we were talking about
[1:15:02] this this weekend why in the world
[1:15:04] didn't Jesus just come down here and
[1:15:06] tell us everything plain and and then
[1:15:09] here we go
[1:15:13] he said he spoke in parables
[1:15:15] and riddles
[1:15:17] and Mysteries
[1:15:19] to hide it from the wise improve it to
[1:15:21] make it where you can't read it like a
[1:15:22] newspaper
[1:15:24] that way the devil could read it that
[1:15:25] way listen the devil can't get
[1:15:27] Revelation folks you and I are the only
[1:15:29] people can get revelation
[1:15:31] it's what God's really just like we were
[1:15:33] talking about
[1:15:34] that was a new group or a couple of new
[1:15:36] people there so we were talking about
[1:15:37] what happened in the garden that well
[1:15:39] Moses I mean Moses wrote that
[1:15:42] what two thousand years after the it
[1:15:47] happened in the Garden of Eden
[1:15:49] remember you had two thousand years you
[1:15:50] had to flood and then Here Comes
[1:15:52] um no one comes on the other side and
[1:15:54] then he starts having these kids and
[1:15:55] Moses pops up well Moses is over here he
[1:15:57] writes the first five books of the Bible
[1:15:59] he's over there looking at what happened
[1:16:00] in Genesis why didn't he just write down
[1:16:02] there was a beast that was in between
[1:16:04] man and a monkey and he got
[1:16:06] um he got
[1:16:07] incarnate by the devil and the and then
[1:16:10] he laid down with Eve and they had
[1:16:12] intercourse and then a child was born
[1:16:14] why did he say that
[1:16:22] right
[1:16:24] from the very wise
[1:16:26] prudent people
[1:16:29] you know it was a person there I know
[1:16:32] someone's going to see that but there
[1:16:33] was a person there not in the message he
[1:16:35] they told him about the what happened in
[1:16:37] the garden you know like a year or two
[1:16:39] ago and he called him perverted he said
[1:16:41] y'all just about perverts
[1:16:45] you better be careful
[1:16:47] that's what the word of God said the
[1:16:49] word of God said that's what happened in
[1:16:50] the Garden of Eden
[1:16:53] so anyway
[1:16:55] so why didn't Moses do that Moses wrote
[1:16:57] it in symbols he saw he said okay God's
[1:17:00] going to change that into a snake that's
[1:17:01] going to be a serpent but he's a beast
[1:17:03] and we're going to write way on over
[1:17:05] here in the Bible
[1:17:07] another Prophet is going to talk about
[1:17:09] being the fruit of your mother and the
[1:17:11] fruit of the womb and and the fruit
[1:17:14] coming forth from the midst of the
[1:17:15] garden and all this all these symbols
[1:17:17] comes together and tells you the exactly
[1:17:19] what happened but it's not just written
[1:17:21] out there
[1:17:22] so God does hide it like this right here
[1:17:25] the whole word is rodent Mysteries
[1:17:27] and only knowledge of God can reveal it
[1:17:29] then when you get in saying punctuate it
[1:17:31] with an amen
[1:17:33] somebody ought to practice that
[1:17:35] then add that to your face
[1:17:38] brother I'm saying the 70th week of
[1:17:40] Daniel he says the spirit of wisdom
[1:17:41] comes into the church to make known to
[1:17:43] the church by the revelation of the Holy
[1:17:45] Ghost look bringing the church in and
[1:17:47] revealing what day we're living in sure
[1:17:49] we know we're living in the end time
[1:17:50] sure we know we're living in the last
[1:17:52] days but where are you at
[1:17:54] in that last day
[1:17:56] where are you at not where your pastors
[1:17:58] at not where the preachers are at where
[1:18:00] are you at
[1:18:03] bring the church in to reveal what day
[1:18:05] we're living in just the same as Gabriel
[1:18:07] to Daniel the Holy Spirit comes to the
[1:18:09] church in the last days to reveal these
[1:18:11] great deep secret things do you
[1:18:13] understand it now look at the word
[1:18:14] wisdom I like this
[1:18:18] the wisdom which belongs to men
[1:18:22] specifically the varied knowledge of
[1:18:23] things human and divine
[1:18:25] acquired by acuteness and experience and
[1:18:28] summed up in maxims and proverbs
[1:18:33] Britain and Mysteries in the Book of
[1:18:34] Proverbs
[1:18:36] if you'll watch that movie chosen Jesus
[1:18:39] says that kind of goes over your head
[1:18:42] I like that part
[1:18:44] we used to Matthew was saying he was
[1:18:45] reading in the Proverbs he said that's
[1:18:46] kind of deep you know
[1:18:50] the science alert the act of
[1:18:52] interpreting dreams and always giving
[1:18:54] the sages advice
[1:18:56] the intelligence evicted events in
[1:19:01] discovering the meaning of some
[1:19:04] mysterious number of vision
[1:19:06] skill in the management of Affairs this
[1:19:08] is wisdom because listen I just read to
[1:19:11] you the spirit of wisdom is to come back
[1:19:13] into the church to do what
[1:19:16] teacher stay stage right here watch this
[1:19:20] killing the management of Affairs devout
[1:19:23] and proper Prudence in intercourse with
[1:19:24] men not Disciples of Christ in other
[1:19:26] words how to talk to a sinner
[1:19:28] that's what they're saying
[1:19:30] how to talk to a sinner
[1:19:32] do you know how to talk to a sinner if
[1:19:34] you're a sinner you don't
[1:19:36] oh you tell them stuff and you can blind
[1:19:38] their eyes but
[1:19:40] look skill and discretion in imparting
[1:19:45] Christian truth
[1:19:47] skill and discretion in other words
[1:19:49] don't try to cram it down their throat
[1:19:51] have wisdom have patience
[1:19:54] and some difference
[1:19:56] the knowledge and practice of the
[1:19:58] requisites for Godly and upright Living
[1:20:01] Social requirement
[1:20:03] and you know what it is you know the
[1:20:05] requirements for Godly living
[1:20:08] that's why I'm telling you as we get
[1:20:10] closer and closer up that statue of
[1:20:12] perfect man look how narrow it gets
[1:20:15] some people can't live it that far up
[1:20:18] just the way it is
[1:20:22] listen in this day and age
[1:20:25] everybody gets a trophy
[1:20:29] sorry that ain't what happened when we
[1:20:31] was growing up
[1:20:35] and that ain't happening with God either
[1:20:37] it's a requirement to go up the statue
[1:20:39] of perfect Mountain he's not going to
[1:20:40] lose you but you don't get a trophy in
[1:20:42] The Headstone you don't get a change of
[1:20:43] the body if you don't do what God Said
[1:20:49] well that's the truth
[1:20:51] that we come down to place to now to
[1:20:52] where everybody gets a trophy everybody
[1:20:54] gets a hundred on the test everybody
[1:20:56] gets destroyed
[1:21:00] that's not so in the word of God
[1:21:04] brother Brown said you either told the
[1:21:06] line and you either told the line
[1:21:09] or you're out
[1:21:12] that's why the little things that we
[1:21:14] preach on that's wide down here to have
[1:21:16] faith but when you got to live virtue
[1:21:19] and then live knowledge and then live
[1:21:20] Temperance added to all these things
[1:21:23] some people are not going to be able to
[1:21:26] control their temper
[1:21:30] you listen to what brother Brown said he
[1:21:32] said you come up with this way this far
[1:21:33] and you mess up in other words you fall
[1:21:40] I'm glad you're quiet
[1:21:41] because this is not just because you're
[1:21:43] sitting here listening to this you're
[1:21:44] going to get them
[1:21:47] you got work to do
[1:21:49] you gotta overcome
[1:21:51] I've got to overcome
[1:21:53] we've all got to have that overcoming
[1:21:56] power
[1:21:58] take it to Jesus now and say Lord I need
[1:22:02] knowledge
[1:22:03] I don't know what those people are
[1:22:05] saying I just now come into the message
[1:22:07] or I've been gone for a long time and
[1:22:09] I'm just coming in the middle of this of
[1:22:10] this ball game
[1:22:12] and I won't know the plan listen if you
[1:22:15] take that earnestly and honestly to God
[1:22:17] just like God taught
[1:22:20] bro Joe it didn't take him two years to
[1:22:22] learn how to read either
[1:22:24] it took him just a very short time to
[1:22:26] learn how to read because God was
[1:22:28] sitting there feeling as long as he kept
[1:22:29] that Bible open God was telling him what
[1:22:31] those words were
[1:22:37] for who can add or take away from the
[1:22:39] perfect revelation of God and overcome
[1:22:41] the enemy now who's your greatest enemy
[1:22:44] the devil nope
[1:22:46] do this right here
[1:22:50] don't you point at me Point yourself
[1:22:54] look it is that simple though it is that
[1:22:56] simple
[1:22:58] there's nothing of such prevailing power
[1:23:00] as the revelation of the word what it'll
[1:23:04] make you live right
[1:23:07] see in verse 3 of blessing is pronounced
[1:23:09] on those who give special attention to
[1:23:10] this book He's reading and kind of in
[1:23:12] the church ages there in Revelations
[1:23:13] there to he that overcometh to he that
[1:23:16] overcometh not that he that just shows
[1:23:18] up
[1:23:21] I think this refers to the Old Testament
[1:23:23] custom of the priest reading the word to
[1:23:25] the congregation in the morning you see
[1:23:26] many cannot read the priest had to read
[1:23:28] for him as long as the word the blessing
[1:23:30] was there if it didn't matter if it was
[1:23:31] read or heard Ephesians 1 verse 17 we'll
[1:23:33] stop here in just a second I'm not going
[1:23:35] to get far enough but I think we've kind
[1:23:37] of
[1:23:38] we'll have the whole weekend
[1:23:40] to start on uh
[1:23:42] Temperance and patience have patience
[1:23:44] please let the god of our Lord Jesus
[1:23:47] Christ the father of Glory may give unto
[1:23:48] you the spirit of wisdom now he said
[1:23:50] that brother Brown said the spirit of
[1:23:51] wisdom I'm going to come back into the
[1:23:53] church
[1:23:53] now the Bible's telling us this he's
[1:23:55] going to give you the spirit of wisdom
[1:23:57] and Revelation in the knowledge of him
[1:24:00] the eyes of your understanding being
[1:24:03] enlightened
[1:24:07] wow that's what that means
[1:24:09] wow that's how that fits together
[1:24:14] have a wild moment every once in a while
[1:24:20] listen Revelation should excite you
[1:24:23] because it's not to the world
[1:24:25] they can get excited about ball games
[1:24:27] and they get signed about this and they
[1:24:29] get excited about that but they can't
[1:24:30] they will not ever get excited about the
[1:24:32] word of God unless they're born again
[1:24:34] ever and guess what this will condemn
[1:24:37] them under their judgment if they are
[1:24:39] not a part of the word of God
[1:24:41] the eyes of your understanding being
[1:24:44] enlightened that you may know what is
[1:24:46] the hope of his calling and what the
[1:24:47] riches of the glory of us isn't his
[1:24:49] inherit what is his inheritance in the
[1:24:51] Saints to give you the Holy Ghost
[1:24:54] to be a child of God
[1:24:56] the word revelation is the act the
[1:24:58] process of disclosing something
[1:24:59] previously secret or obscure especially
[1:25:02] something true
[1:25:04] a fact disclosed or revealed especially
[1:25:06] in a dramatic or a surprising way
[1:25:09] somebody ought to absolutely try that
[1:25:11] sometime
[1:25:12] hmm
[1:25:16] in Christianity it's God's disclosure
[1:25:18] disclosure of his own nature
[1:25:21] you are reading the Bible you're reading
[1:25:23] the nature of God
[1:25:25] and his purpose for mankind his plan
[1:25:29] especially through the words of human
[1:25:30] and sorry about that
[1:25:34] through the words of preachers
[1:25:38] human intermediaries
[1:25:41] something and we in which such a Divine
[1:25:42] disclosure is contained such as
[1:25:45] the Bible
[1:25:47] brother Brown said to the prevailing
[1:25:49] overcoming church is built on Revelation
[1:25:51] so we can expect God to reveal his truth
[1:25:53] to us however you actually don't need a
[1:25:55] revelation of water baptism it's right
[1:25:57] there it's staring you in the face
[1:25:59] Hebrews 5 13 magicians get ready to come
[1:26:01] for everyone that uses milk is
[1:26:03] unskillful
[1:26:05] and the word of righteousness
[1:26:07] I'm sitting there today and y'all kind
[1:26:09] of read that
[1:26:10] um
[1:26:11] kind of something passed over me there
[1:26:13] at the airport we were waiting to to get
[1:26:15] on a plane and
[1:26:17] we didn't get our 600 they put us on the
[1:26:19] plane anyway but anyway we need to come
[1:26:21] on home
[1:26:22] so you can't blame you and you blame me
[1:26:24] I was a little slow I was I was I was a
[1:26:28] little slow I'm sorry I'm confessing in
[1:26:29] front of everybody
[1:26:32] but when we were when we were up there
[1:26:34] in in Ohio
[1:26:36] um the wedding was going on
[1:26:40] uh one of the uh brother Isaac's
[1:26:43] daughter had had a brand new baby I
[1:26:45] don't know how Julius how three months
[1:26:46] old born in February or something like
[1:26:48] that maybe no born in December so anyway
[1:26:50] two or three months so just as health as
[1:26:52] it can be
[1:26:53] just as helpless as can be and I just
[1:26:56] stood back and watched
[1:26:58] everybody
[1:27:03] I mean you know three or four if you're
[1:27:04] around her you know she's she's you know
[1:27:06] you don't weren't diving off the table
[1:27:07] you don't want her
[1:27:09] shoving something in her mouth a candle
[1:27:11] you know they had their attention on her
[1:27:14] everywhere
[1:27:15] she couldn't eat they had to feed her
[1:27:17] well she was feeding another other ways
[1:27:19] but you had to do it for her
[1:27:22] baby
[1:27:23] and she's just like you know if you if
[1:27:24] you stood her up you let her go
[1:27:28] it's like God nobody did that
[1:27:30] but they had to hand her across the
[1:27:32] table to me and I took her
[1:27:35] and I held her up and I held her and I
[1:27:37] said oh man I didn't have a little baby
[1:27:39] like this in a long time
[1:27:41] that's Jesus's when he saves your soul
[1:27:46] he said I've never held a baby like this
[1:27:48] before even though he's held billions by
[1:27:51] the new birth you're special to him
[1:27:54] Julia was special you know there was a
[1:27:56] lot of people in that in that venue that
[1:27:58] that never even acknowledged it Julia
[1:28:01] was a baby and she was there
[1:28:03] and that she needed help but her family
[1:28:06] come on somebody
[1:28:09] her family
[1:28:10] was commissioned to look after her
[1:28:13] and I became part of that family because
[1:28:15] I wanted the family to to enjoy their
[1:28:17] self you know what babies you yeah you
[1:28:20] have to have their attention I mean you
[1:28:21] they have to have your attention so I
[1:28:23] took her and I held her and I took her
[1:28:24] over to the side
[1:28:26] and a just a warm feeling come over me
[1:28:29] it was like this God this is what you
[1:28:30] did for us
[1:28:33] you took us away from our natural family
[1:28:37] by the new birth
[1:28:39] but you held us as yours
[1:28:43] and you're still holding on to us until
[1:28:44] the day that we can walk on our own two
[1:28:46] feet
[1:28:48] and he he feeds us
[1:28:50] close us
[1:28:52] changes our dirty diapers
[1:28:56] somebody say Amen I know all y'all got
[1:28:59] dirty diapers
[1:29:00] or had them
[1:29:03] but he did all that and it didn't bother
[1:29:05] them one bit
[1:29:06] and I walked around with that baby for
[1:29:08] about an hour
[1:29:09] and I just thank God and another
[1:29:11] something happened we'll we'll talk
[1:29:13] about later time
[1:29:14] but you hold that baby up there and you
[1:29:16] hear it breathing
[1:29:22] Jesus
[1:29:24] hear me breathe
[1:29:25] let me be so close to God
[1:29:29] till you hear just my breath
[1:29:32] and when I cry I'm right there at your
[1:29:34] ear where I can cry and get what I need
[1:29:36] if I'm hungry I'm right here
[1:29:38] don't put me up somewhere don't put me
[1:29:40] up on a uh you know don't put me in a
[1:29:42] closet or go set me over in the corner
[1:29:44] somewhere nurture Me Lord
[1:29:47] help me to grow
[1:29:48] help me to get bigger
[1:29:50] help me to get stronger in you
[1:29:54] and watch this for everyone that uses
[1:29:56] milk is unskilled from the word of
[1:29:57] righteousness for he's the babe now
[1:29:59] he'll say he's saying it listen this is
[1:30:01] not negative
[1:30:04] this is where you got to begin
[1:30:07] Julia is a baby
[1:30:09] you were a baby
[1:30:11] and you had to use milk but remember
[1:30:16] I'm not gonna do it because I'll make a
[1:30:17] mess but if you just took Julia and put
[1:30:19] her right here with this thing open
[1:30:20] about this far from it what's the first
[1:30:23] thing going to happen
[1:30:25] gonna be a mess
[1:30:26] but actually as she gets older
[1:30:29] she's going to say that's my milk
[1:30:32] I want to drink it
[1:30:35] that's the way we are with God
[1:30:38] but everyone that uses milk is
[1:30:39] unskillful musicians come on but strong
[1:30:43] meat belongs to them that are a full age
[1:30:45] we didn't take Julia over there and eat
[1:30:47] the eat the pork that we had served to
[1:30:50] us and the and the mac and cheese now
[1:30:52] one day she's going to be able to eat
[1:30:53] that but she wasn't able to then she was
[1:30:56] she was able to take milk but that was
[1:30:58] her part of her journey in her life
[1:31:00] the next part of the journey if we when
[1:31:02] we see him again maybe several months
[1:31:03] from now she'll be eating off the table
[1:31:06] literally most of y'all did too eat off
[1:31:09] the table
[1:31:11] but strong meat belongs to them that are
[1:31:13] a full age even those who by reason of
[1:31:16] use
[1:31:17] have their senses exercised to discern
[1:31:21] Good and Evil
[1:31:24] discern means to separate so we've come
[1:31:26] to a time here in in knowledge that
[1:31:29] we've got to separate let's all stand
[1:31:30] our feet
[1:31:31] there's a separation time
[1:31:34] to make a distinction okay I'm just
[1:31:37] going to stay a baby Christian and
[1:31:38] that's just all I'm going to get well
[1:31:39] that's all you're going to get you know
[1:31:41] what the Lord takes that confession he
[1:31:43] stands right here and he looks at the
[1:31:45] father and he says this is all they want
[1:31:46] to be
[1:31:50] but Lord take me
[1:31:52] as a baby
[1:31:54] but take me to your throne and say I
[1:31:57] want to grow up
[1:31:59] I want to be a better not a better
[1:32:01] person I want to be a better Christian
[1:32:04] the true church is the continuation of
[1:32:07] the book of eyes but the Book of
[1:32:08] Revelation shows how that the Antichrist
[1:32:10] Spirit would come into the church defile
[1:32:12] it make it lukewarm formal and Powerless
[1:32:14] it exposes Satan revealing his Works
[1:32:17] attempted destruction to God's people
[1:32:18] and the discrediting of God's word
[1:32:20] that's a whole deal now they're
[1:32:22] discrediting the word of God they're
[1:32:23] discreeting in this message they're
[1:32:25] discreeting brother Brown they're just
[1:32:26] discredible everybody they're
[1:32:27] discreeting Jesus Christ
[1:32:29] saying he who he says he is
[1:32:34] and it's Satan
[1:32:35] write down the time he's casting the
[1:32:37] Lake of Fire he fights it he can't stand
[1:32:39] it he knows if the people get the true
[1:32:41] revelation of the true church
[1:32:43] and what she is and what she stands for
[1:32:45] and that she can do the Greater Works
[1:32:47] she will be an invincible Army if they
[1:32:49] get a true Revelation now true
[1:32:51] revelation of the two Spirits within the
[1:32:53] framework of your body
[1:32:58] hello
[1:32:59] and by God's spirit Discerning will
[1:33:02] stand the Antichrist Spirit state will
[1:33:04] be powerless before her why was Satan
[1:33:07] powerless before Jesus Christ
[1:33:09] he was that
[1:33:13] Satan cannot understand how these
[1:33:15] virtues work if he if he did he'd be
[1:33:17] your brother
[1:33:18] he does not understand how that works so
[1:33:20] as we get closer to the headstone we
[1:33:24] become more like the headstone
[1:33:27] he will be a definitely thwarted today
[1:33:29] as he was when Christ with stood his
[1:33:30] every effort to gain power over him in
[1:33:31] the desert what do you use
[1:33:34] no he stood up and spoke the word and
[1:33:36] said it is written
[1:33:37] it is written
[1:33:39] it is written Thou shalt not tempt the
[1:33:41] Lord thy God Satan hates Revelation but
[1:33:44] we love it with true Revelation in our
[1:33:46] lives the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail
[1:33:48] how many of us want the Gates of Hell to
[1:33:50] be torn down and thrown away boy I do
[1:33:52] y'all some of y'all already must have it
[1:33:54] done the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail
[1:33:56] against us but we will prevail over them
