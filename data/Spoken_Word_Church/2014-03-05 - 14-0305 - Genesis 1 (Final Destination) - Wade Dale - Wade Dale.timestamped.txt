[4:15] Genesis 1 we've looked at Genesis 1 how
[4:17] it impacts um us as
[4:21] Christian um now we're going to go into
[4:24] the Final Destination because there is
[4:27] if you're going to be redeemed you got
[4:29] to be redeemed back to something all
[4:32] right and that's the goal of every
[4:34] Christian is to uh in this time is to
[4:37] make the body change but for all
[4:40] Christians is to be in glory and not to

[5:19] you'll be real early or real late so
[5:22] also remember I want you to keep this in
[5:24] your prayers put it in your little
[5:25] prayer book and and your mind to uh to
[5:28] pray for us in we will not be here June
[5:30] and I will not be here for the
[5:32] fellowship meeting we're going to be in
[5:34] Miami Florida doing a five night or five
[5:40] service um convention for a uh Haitian
[5:44] church down in Miami so uh the brother's
[5:47] name is Roosevelt lzma he asked me to uh
[5:51] if I would and praying about it and and
[5:54] uh seeking the will of the Lord and and
[5:58] uh I I have hesitations about going to
[6:00] Miami but if God sends you then you
[6:03] don't have to worry about where you go
[6:04] never worried about going to Jamaica
[6:05] because I believe the Lord ordained us
[6:08] to go there so so just keep that in your
[6:10] prayers keep it in your heart it's a
[6:12] long time from now but if you start
[6:14] praying now maybe you'll remember by
[6:16] then so but that will be May 15th
[6:19] through the 18th that'll be five
[6:20] Services I I clarified with the brother
[6:22] the other day I thought I was doing
[6:23] maybe one of the service he says no
[6:25] brother you're doing the whole
[6:26] convention so it's going to be I got to
[6:28] brush up on my fren sister Trudy tant um

[6:34] confused than anything else and my cuz
[6:37] they speak a creole French not just a
[6:39] regular French it's say actually like a
[6:42] Louisiana Creole French so I think I'll
[6:45] stick with English and Let The
[6:47] Interpreter do the work so just keep us
[6:49] in your prayers though everybody feeling
[6:52] okay amen everybody all right let's bow
[6:54] our heads and talk to the talk to the
[6:56] one that brought us here Heavenly Father
[6:58] we pray tonight Lord that you would
[7:01] again as we always say be the active
[7:04] participant in the service please don't
[7:06] be the bystander of a recorder of our
[7:08] thoughts and ideas because they're wrong
[7:10] and and against you father but may as we
[7:13] speak here and just for just a little
[7:15] while that that you'll come down and and
[7:18] be the one to to see one to hear and and
[7:22] the one to speak father we ask you
[7:24] Quicken the word father we know the
[7:26] word's anointed already but anoint us
[7:28] father to hear the word
[7:30] be with each one Lord in the building we
[7:32] pray that you'd be with a little bride
[7:33] around the world there be any sick among
[7:35] us you said you sent the word and healed
[7:37] them and deliver them from destruction
[7:39] so we ask Lord that you would take care
[7:40] of each one Lord be with the
[7:43] missionaries on the Foreign Fields give
[7:45] them fruit for their labor be with the
[7:46] ones that are that are coming in next
[7:48] weekend brother Vernon from the
[7:50] Philippines just bless him and be with
[7:51] him be with us Lord as we travel just be
[7:53] with a little bride around the world cuz
[7:55] we truly are your children father we are
[7:59] the Masterpiece family the one you've
[8:02] always wanted to see and here we are
[8:04] father forgive us of our sins be with us
[8:07] take care of us in the furtherment of
[8:08] this service in Jesus name we pray amen
[8:11] Genesis
[8:13] 1:26 and God said let us make man in our
[8:16] image after our likeness and let them
[8:18] have dominion over the fish of the sea
[8:19] and over the foul of the air and over
[8:20] the cattle and over all the Earth and
[8:22] over every creeping thing that creepeth
[8:24] upon the
[8:25] Earth so God created man in his own
[8:28] image in the image of God created he him
[8:32] male and female created he them and God
[8:35] blessed them now here we're going to see
[8:38] that we're going to see some things in a
[8:39] little while that we looked at these
[8:41] definitions but I want to kind of maybe
[8:43] uh let you I I was I was thinking today
[8:47] and I thought well Lord I'll just put
[8:49] the put the things together and you the
[8:51] thought came to me well just put a seed
[8:54] out there and let it let them do
[8:56] it let you because see I can stand up
[8:59] here and speak all night but unless you
[9:02] relate to something or or or the seed is
[9:05] being nurtured you can the seed is the
[9:07] word of God so as we preach the word of
[9:09] God you either take it in or you spit it
[9:10] out or or or you don't get it at
[9:13] all and then when you don't get it at
[9:15] all it doesn't do you any good all right
[9:18] I've always told Brother Claude I said I
[9:20] said brother Claude you'll understand
[9:21] one thing as a preacher you get your
[9:24] anointing while you're studying that's
[9:26] our anointing we get our anointing while
[9:27] we're studying brother B said I was
[9:29] sitting in the woods and and I was
[9:30] sitting at the tree and he said you
[9:32] thought I was a wild man he said cuz I
[9:34] started writing scriptures down he said
[9:35] then I started running running around
[9:37] the tree well that was his that was his
[9:39] anointing God had anointed the word to
[9:41] that man and same way with a with a
[9:43] minister and a lot of people don't
[9:45] understand that you say well I've got to
[9:46] get anointed to preach no we actually we
[9:49] were born with a gift right to get
[9:51] oursel out of the way getting another
[9:52] gear so that God can anoint us first cuz
[9:55] if he doesn't anoint us first he's not
[9:57] going to anoint you so so the word's
[9:59] already anointed so maybe we can just
[10:01] clear some things out of your head a
[10:03] little bit today that will help us to
[10:05] realize that uh keep this in mind as we
[10:08] go through I think we're always putting
[10:11] things off as humans we put things off
[10:13] we're procrastinators most of us
[10:16] 99.9% but God wants us to realize that
[10:18] things have already been done all all
[10:20] the provisions have been made and that
[10:23] everything we need so we don't have to
[10:24] go get anything cuz right here in verse
[10:27] 28 God blessed them God said unto them
[10:29] he's speaking straight to whoever that
[10:31] group of people he's not speaking
[10:32] through he's speaking straight to that
[10:34] group of people be fruitful and multiply
[10:37] replenish the Earth and subdue it and
[10:39] have dominion over the fish of the sea
[10:40] and over the foul of the air and over
[10:42] every living thing that moveth upon the
[10:44] earth now that pretty much covers
[10:45] everything Brother Gary that pretty much
[10:46] covers the whole the whole earth
[10:50] everything that creeping creeps on the
[10:51] Earth all the fish in the water and all
[10:53] the foul in the air so that pretty much
[10:54] covers it all so now let's read in
[10:57] Revelations 21
[11:01] verse
[11:03] one I like it when you can take it from
[11:05] Genesis to Revelation and I saw a new
[11:08] Heaven and a new Earth for the first
[11:10] Heaven and the first Earth were passed
[11:11] away and there was no more sea and I
[11:15] John saw the holy city New Jerusalem
[11:18] coming down from God out of Heaven
[11:20] prepared as a bride adorned for a
[11:23] husband and I heard a great voice out of
[11:25] Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of
[11:27] God is with men and he will dwell with
[11:30] them and they shall be his people and
[11:31] God
[11:32] himself Not Another Not a second person
[11:36] not a third person God himself shall be
[11:39] with them there's that them right we
[11:43] picked it up in Genesis 1 them God
[11:46] blessed them now we look and we see that
[11:49] God himself shall be with them and be
[11:52] their God you may be seated and the Lord
[11:54] add his Blessing to the reading of the
[11:55] word I believe there that we that John
[11:58] saw saw the holy city he saw the New
[12:00] Jerusalem he saw it as a bride Adorn for
[12:03] a husband John actually saw Adam and Eve
[12:07] back in the Garden of Eden
[12:10] right that's right hey if Adam and Eve
[12:12] was drove out and Redemption puts them
[12:14] back it's
[12:16] not Tom and Susie going back into the
[12:18] garden right it's Adam and Eve going
[12:21] back into the garden all right so that's
[12:23] where full restoration comes is where
[12:25] you see that this journey that this
[12:28] Genesis 1
[12:29] is taking sure there was a there was a
[12:32] gap in there where that if we had not
[12:35] been part of the fall or or God didn't
[12:38] have an attribute of healer Savior and
[12:40] Redeemer he just had an attribute of
[12:42] father if he just had that then then
[12:44] there would have been no need for the
[12:46] city to come down the city would have
[12:47] been here it would have been it would
[12:49] have been the Garden of Eden all right
[12:52] because remember I'm going to read you
[12:53] several quotes and you know many of them
[12:55] by heart but brother R talks about us
[12:56] going back into the garden Christ the
[12:58] mystery of God revealed you know that
[13:00] third purpose was to restore Fallen Eve
[13:02] or for Adam and Eve to get back into the
[13:04] garden because to get back into the
[13:07] garden restores all things because in
[13:09] the garden there you got Adam and there
[13:11] you got Eve and they're they're
[13:13] expressing the they're expressing their
[13:17] godship their rulership they're
[13:20] expressing that Adam had control over
[13:23] everything Eve
[13:26] also rightly had had control and Eve
[13:30] also so here we see that it's not uh you
[13:34] look and you see heirs and Joint HS you
[13:36] see that when we what God has done
[13:39] because of Fallen Eve he's going to take
[13:42] that part and he's going to restore it
[13:44] back to its full dominion and full power
[13:48] because we're join HS with Christ not
[13:51] not here and here join HS is is together
[13:55] one so it's not it's whatever we lost so
[13:58] Adam remember just kind of backgrounding
[14:01] just a little
[14:02] bit Adam was the complete gene
[14:04] expression of God for his time you hear
[14:06] what I said for his time he was a gene
[14:09] expression for his time he was the very
[14:11] DNA of God he was the attributes of God
[14:14] being made manifest on the face of the
[14:16] Earth all right so now we see though
[14:20] that that all that came into view that
[14:23] that that
[14:24] theophonic 1: 126 man everybody
[14:27] understand that's the theophonic that's
[14:28] the theophany of God Amen not another
[14:32] person not a not a like substance right
[14:36] you got to go back to that we can't we
[14:39] can't see ourselves as second
[14:45] persons now in natural form Josh is is
[14:48] me made manifest in another form and he
[14:50] is another person that's down here right
[14:53] that's human relations but God relations
[14:56] is the problem was is we see ourselves
[14:58] yourself as a second
[15:01] person that's the problem we see but
[15:04] remember these things have already been
[15:06] spoken by God God's already blessed this
[15:08] group of people he's already said
[15:10] multiply he's already said replenish
[15:12] he's already said have dominion so it's
[15:15] going to
[15:16] happen whatever God said it's going to
[15:18] happen all right so that's going to take
[15:20] place but we see that if it's already
[15:23] spoken by God it's going to take place
[15:26] but during that time the attributes of
[15:28] God
[15:29] were not fully made
[15:31] known even in the Old
[15:33] Testament right I want you to see that
[15:36] how how that you and I are we we see
[15:40] that that God is he's so gracious
[15:43] remember I want you to remember one
[15:44] thing I was telling uh the group over in
[15:47] uh Columbia the other day remember this
[15:49] is not for God's
[15:52] benefit he knows these things the
[15:55] Bible's not telling him something he
[15:56] don't know right he already knows it
[16:00] amen he wants us to realize it so it's
[16:03] not a surprise to him and it's not a
[16:06] it's not something that that God just
[16:07] thought of yesterday and it's not like a
[16:09] newspaper where he printed the Bible up
[16:12] yesterday or the day before when
[16:13] something else happened no this is all
[16:15] done and you can look at true
[16:17] predestination you can see that that you
[16:20] got here by some
[16:21] way but the reason you got here by some
[16:24] way is he saw that Genesis 126 man
[16:27] looked down through time and saw where
[16:28] it was going to land and that you
[16:34] you remember as a as that together were
[16:37] the fullness of the godhead
[16:39] bodily I'm jumping ahead a little bit
[16:41] but I'll back up in a minute all
[16:44] together will the fullness of the
[16:45] godhead Bly not one person except Jesus
[16:48] Christ because Jesus had us in him he
[16:50] could be the fullness but see I don't
[16:53] have all of you in
[16:56] me so that I can't be the fullness but
[16:59] brother Dale has a fullness his part
[17:02] brother Tatum had a fullness his part
[17:04] brother Tom had a fullness his part
[17:06] right and the only way that God's going
[17:09] to get back together right is to bring
[17:13] all those attributes back on this
[17:16] Earth amen and going to bring his
[17:19] children
[17:20] back because Satan didn't steal some of
[17:23] them but he took them for a downfall
[17:26] right can we say that he took just took
[17:29] him for a downfall because remember I
[17:30] was telling him uh in the U Bible study
[17:34] the other night the Bible says the dead
[17:36] in Christ shall rise first now there
[17:38] ain't nothing dead in
[17:43] Christ when we listen I want you to
[17:46] raise your hand when we read that
[17:47] scripture we literally think that the
[17:50] dead out there in the in the in the uh
[17:53] mums and the dead in that's not true
[17:57] exactly
[17:59] Christians are asleep you died in Christ
[18:02] when you got the new birth so that dead
[18:04] in Christ is going to rise first amen so
[18:08] they're coming up the dead in Christ the
[18:11] ones that's already died here because
[18:13] remember don't worry about the second
[18:15] death if you've already went through the
[18:16] first
[18:18] one that's why brother Brown says he
[18:20] fell asleep that's why the Bible says
[18:22] step fell asleep they just brother Tatum
[18:25] just fell
[18:27] asleep God did him a favor right he'd be
[18:31] hund and something years old now and he
[18:33] it'd be in a horrible condition we just
[18:36] don't look at it that way right but
[18:40] remember excuse me I didn't bring any
[18:42] water up here can somebody get me just a
[18:43] little glass of water I usually do it
[18:46] myself but I didn't do it myself this
[18:49] time but remember the dead read the
[18:52] Bible the dead in
[18:54] Christ I died in Christ in 1997 exactly
[18:59] so I don't have to die again this thing
[19:01] right here may fall
[19:02] asleep but when I come
[19:06] back right I'm going to pick this thing
[19:09] up and it's going to change it well now
[19:12] there's a group of
[19:14] people so says the Bible that that will
[19:17] not happen to all right you love the
[19:20] Lord he's got this journey it is
[19:23] predestinated it is it is done and
[19:26] finished in God's eyes it is pred before
[19:28] you get here but it's because of the
[19:30] forn knowledge of God knowing what you
[19:32] choose when you get here you've heard
[19:34] that I don't think you've heard it
[19:36] enough but I think we've heard it to
[19:38] where we can understand that everything
[19:41] comes by for knowledge everything if God
[19:44] didn't for know it then it didn't happen
[19:48] right what a mighty God we serve so so
[19:51] the little things that we go through and
[19:52] pops up in life and all the the
[19:54] heartaches and
[19:56] troubles it didn't surprise God right
[19:59] that's right and if he's in
[20:02] you you can take it better I didn't say
[20:05] you was going to do away with it I said
[20:06] you can take it better what we've been
[20:08] studying in the Bible in the Sunday
[20:10] school class downstairs the statue of a
[20:12] perfect man I I think it's it's vitally
[20:15] important because
[20:17] remember Genesis 1:26 was given
[20:20] power before the foundation of the world
[20:24] right right hello
[20:27] somebody power before the foundation of
[20:30] the world I just read it to you and God
[20:33] blessed them and God multiplied
[20:35] replenish and subdue and have dominion
[20:37] they weren't even in flesh bodies yet
[20:40] right amen right but here we are in
[20:43] flesh bodies and we can't hardly get to
[20:47] church come on we've got the power right
[20:52] but Power without character you know
[20:54] what the prophet said it's
[20:55] satanic it's not that the power satanic
[20:59] right the power is not satanic the power
[21:02] is of God but the way you use
[21:05] it in the hands of a novice that's why
[21:07] the Old Testament I I don't and I know
[21:10] you don't and but maybe some people out
[21:12] there sees that the Old Testament had
[21:14] the new birth or or or you know had the
[21:17] Holy Ghost like we do I don't see that
[21:19] because the blood of bulls and goats was
[21:21] just a substitute it didn't do away with
[21:24] a man's sin it just covered it or capoed
[21:27] it just it just kept it covered until
[21:29] Christ came to do away with it so they
[21:32] weren't a part of that Genesis 1 126 man
[21:35] because that was lost in the fall the
[21:39] book was taken I'm trying to get all get
[21:41] all this banked together and then we'll
[21:42] then we'll rush through some quotes
[21:44] here but in the Old Testament it did
[21:48] show God's
[21:50] attributes yes sir I mean they were on
[21:52] display Isaiah Daniel U you name them
[21:55] they they were on display Abraham Isaac
[21:58] hey they're the foundation they're the
[22:02] pillows that's the C I don't have one of
[22:04] them great big things like Bob had the
[22:05] other day I told him we was going to get
[22:06] him a hydration pack and put it on his
[22:08] back next time he preach and I told him
[22:10] too I said he remember at the first of
[22:12] the service he said I don't have
[22:14] anything
[22:15] tonight if he ever gets something it'll
[22:18] be a three-hour sermon cuz that was an
[22:19] hour and a half from
[22:21] nothing did a good
[22:23] job absolutely a good
[22:26] job
[22:29] and he's going to go somewhere in a
[22:30] couple weeks to preach and I'll let him
[22:32] announce that to you so he just told me
[22:33] a few minutes ago so anyway so on the
[22:36] Old Testament the attributes were showed
[22:37] in
[22:39] type remember in the book of I think
[22:42] it's maybe in Romans where where Paul is
[22:45] talking he says look he said those were
[22:47] given to us for an example so they were
[22:50] examples couldn't be the children of God
[22:53] they could be examples of the children
[22:55] of God I'm going somewhere with this all
[22:57] right but now look when the fullness
[23:00] came which was Jesus Christ he came with
[23:03] that theophany that Genesis 126 man he
[23:07] came with that inside of him everybody
[23:09] clear with
[23:10] that because that's the theophany of
[23:13] almighty God there God doesn't have two
[23:16] theophanies God doesn't have two Holy
[23:18] Ghost right he's either got the new you
[23:20] either got the new birth or you don't
[23:23] you know there's no there's no gray area
[23:25] there but when the fullness came the
[23:27] genis one was in him the very attributes
[23:30] of God and he displayed them on the
[23:34] earth now as we were speaking before
[23:37] last um couple Wednesdays ago we were
[23:41] with him we were in him when he walked
[23:45] the shores of Galilee we were in him
[23:47] when he preached we were in him how do
[23:49] you think that we can heal we can't heal
[23:51] the sick but how do you think God heals
[23:52] the sick through
[23:54] us if he didn't come and heal the sick
[23:59] how would we know how to heal the S how
[24:00] would we know how to get them in the
[24:01] condition to to be healed or a condition
[24:04] to be saved nobody knew anything about
[24:05] salvation till Christ came nobody
[24:08] understood it Nicodemus didn't look at
[24:11] that example the man lived in the
[24:15] temple and he didn't understand anything
[24:17] about this new kingdom or this new birth
[24:19] or or or the coming back of power of
[24:21] this Kingdom that that Christ was
[24:23] talking about but now
[24:25] look Jesus wasn't a type anymore he was
[24:29] the literal person amen all right so he
[24:32] was the literal one that was coming to
[24:35] bring the power back remember I I I read
[24:38] that um quote to you not too long ago
[24:40] where Jesus didn't come to bring you
[24:42] your inheritance everybody understand
[24:45] that that's kind of hard for some people
[24:47] because you go preach it at other places
[24:48] and you better read that quote because
[24:49] they'll look at you pretty strange but
[24:52] he didn't come to bring you inheritance
[24:54] back your inheritance was at Genesis
[24:56] 1:26 right Dominion power replenish
[25:00] multiply you can't do away with that God
[25:03] said it it's going to happen but it was
[25:06] it was covered or or it was it was
[25:08] pushed back into Calvary so that the
[25:11] real deal could come the very attribute
[25:14] of God not something that acted like God
[25:17] right Satan acts like
[25:20] God if if if brother B said Satan I know
[25:24] Dad made a comment the other day and
[25:25] I've been thinking on that how that
[25:27] Satan brother says Satan can pass out
[25:28] Supernatural gifts now he did not say he
[25:30] could make Supernatural gifts he could
[25:33] pass them out well see Satan's Satan is
[25:37] spiritual he's a
[25:40] conduit he can pass out God's spiritual
[25:44] gifts right amen amen he did that in
[25:47] that man that brother Bram said stood up
[25:49] and spoke in tongues remember and he was
[25:52] living with another man's wife and had a
[25:53] couple of kids that was a conduit Satan
[25:56] but s he said that man was full of the
[25:58] devil so there's Supernatural gifts
[26:00] coming through a devil possessed
[26:02] person but it was a conduit there Satan
[26:05] is very spiritual Satan is not something
[26:07] in a barroom or something like that he's
[26:10] very spiritual he's highly spiritual and
[26:12] in this day and age he's so close to it
[26:16] would deceive the very elect if it was
[26:18] possible but we know it's not going to
[26:19] deceive the very elect but now
[26:22] look the one that fashioned us came amen
[26:27] remember I told you where it says God
[26:28] created that word created means fashion
[26:31] see the one that fashioned us that's why
[26:33] and pull up Revelations 3:14 and we've
[26:35] been through this before but I'm coming
[26:36] to a point here but in Revelations 3:14
[26:39] and to the angel the Church of the
[26:40] layout of sins right these things sayith
[26:42] the amen the faithful and true witness
[26:44] the beginning of the creation of God now
[26:48] Jesus Christ wasn't a creation as you
[26:51] would say creation like we weren't
[26:55] one hello right we we weren't created in
[26:58] Genesis 1 126 from nothing and then
[27:00] something we were fashioned in other
[27:03] words something God pulled everything
[27:04] together and said here's my children
[27:06] they always existed with him because if
[27:08] he had a beginning he's going to have an
[27:10] end right all right so we see here the
[27:14] beginning of the creation of God and
[27:16] then brother Brown says we are the
[27:17] continuation of that creation I didn't
[27:20] bring that quote but that's you you
[27:22] should know that but now what is that
[27:24] creation back
[27:26] to it brought Genesis 1 126 Out of
[27:30] Heaven to
[27:33] Earth CU we're not made to be Spiritual
[27:36] Beings it's not what the prophet said he
[27:39] said Angels were made to be Spiritual
[27:42] Beings he said you're made to be a human
[27:47] amen yes sir how
[27:49] simple but he wants us to be human
[27:52] beings so here is that here is that
[27:54] power or here is that way back right
[27:58] here on the earth and we're there with
[27:59] him in him that's why I said remember he
[28:02] was the fullness of the godhead B
[28:04] Because all the fullness was in him the
[28:06] fullness of what
[28:09] us that's
[28:10] right all of us were in him that's why
[28:14] he can be the fullness of the godhead
[28:16] bodily we can we're we're we're out here
[28:19] now we're we're in a multiplied form out
[28:22] here but remember when we go back to
[28:26] Oneness with God which is brother BR
[28:29] said in Oneness he said it's Adam Eve
[28:31] and God he said that's true Oneness now
[28:34] we look at it
[28:36] is like the denominational World they
[28:38] see
[28:39] three we see one but there's three
[28:43] people standing there but if he got the
[28:45] new birth then it's just God made
[28:47] manifest in another
[28:49] form called a bride so all that fullness
[28:52] was in him The Offspring of God was now
[28:55] being able to come back into power
[28:58] right but now remember we're going to
[29:01] read in just a few
[29:02] minutes how that that character of that
[29:07] man was eat down Through the Ages and
[29:09] brother Dale speaking on that now I
[29:11] thought I'd kind of bring that in too in
[29:13] with this
[29:15] because there was Jesus Christ all the
[29:18] attributes of God all every attribute of
[29:22] God was in Jesus Christ
[29:25] amen John 17 pray the father that that
[29:28] that you be like me and I be like you
[29:30] and they be in you and I be in them it's
[29:32] hard to understand but it's not really I
[29:35] and you and you and me right I and you
[29:39] you and
[29:40] me that's a revelation right that's true
[29:44] Oneness you and me you would think it'd
[29:46] be two but remember when God saw Adam
[29:49] and Eve he saw one amen they were so
[29:52] much one he saw one person and when he
[29:54] sees you and I he he doesn't see us like
[29:58] that he sees us as one he sees us as the
[30:00] fullness of the godhead bodily as
[30:01] brother Dale has been preaching the
[30:03] fullness of the godhead bodily because
[30:06] we are all of God for our part right
[30:10] brought
[30:14] together in a multiplied form that we
[30:17] can see that we see I think God sees us
[30:20] all as
[30:21] one if you're born again you're born
[30:24] again but now look there has to come
[30:26] something though
[30:27] when God brings this stature together he
[30:30] doesn't just stay on the foundation
[30:32] brother Al he he faith is
[30:36] fine that puts you in the body that that
[30:38] gets you into the kingdom that gives you
[30:40] the new birth
[30:41] but that
[30:43] attribute let me just put it this
[30:46] way remember the Son of God didn't take
[30:49] the book in Revelations
[30:52] 5 and it may be a little farfetched for
[30:54] some of you to to realize but the son of
[30:57] God was the spirit that's Spirit God
[30:59] that's the God that was down into the
[31:00] church ages as the Holy Ghost okay but
[31:05] now there was a man come up and took
[31:08] that book in Revelations 5 there was a
[31:11] human cuz he bled he was a bloody lamb
[31:14] but it was a human it was the son of man
[31:16] that's why the son of man has to come
[31:18] back into
[31:19] power in the end time because it's the
[31:22] word made flesh again amen all right in
[31:26] a group of people all those other ones
[31:28] that have went on there they were under
[31:30] the Son of God dispensation where they
[31:32] had the new birth and they had the Holy
[31:34] Ghost just like you and I do but they
[31:37] were not able and and I'll I'll
[31:39] emphasize this in just a minute the
[31:41] Bible says loose the
[31:44] seals they were bound
[31:46] somewhere and he's going to loose them
[31:49] all right so now let's go let's read
[31:51] number
[31:53] one but just keep that in your mind
[31:55] because on the day of Pentecost the
[31:59] kingdom started coming into po everybody
[32:02] understand that say Amen that when it's
[32:04] the new birth on the day of Pentecost
[32:06] 120 in the upper room there was 120
[32:09] offsprings of God all
[32:12] right I'm not talking about second
[32:15] person same person all right it's just
[32:18] that Genesis one heading to its final
[32:21] destination because remember once sin
[32:24] happened brother Gary there's no way we
[32:26] could go back to Genesis 126 like the
[32:29] Genesis 126 says at that time right
[32:33] Dominion replenish multiply all sure we
[32:36] do that in a perverted form now does
[32:38] everybody see that we do that in a
[32:41] perverted form we multipli and replenish
[32:44] the Earth we've subdued it man's taken
[32:46] over this world but it's Satan's eeden
[32:48] it's what Satan has done everybody
[32:51] understand that right cuz remember Satan
[32:54] can he's not an original of anything
[32:56] right right he's a perverter of anything
[32:59] if God brings something if God brings
[33:01] this Genesis 126
[33:03] person into being then Satan's right
[33:06] there to bring something like it he
[33:09] can't touch it but he can bring
[33:10] something like it all right it's what we
[33:13] were talking about that Satan can pass
[33:14] out Supernatural gifts sure he can on
[33:18] the only ones at the end time it's the
[33:19] true Holy Ghost through an anointed
[33:21] person that's of the devil brother
[33:23] randam said all right so there's a
[33:25] conduit that Satan can use
[33:31] that's why it's so
[33:33] hard to to realize that if you've got
[33:36] the new birth sure
[33:39] you're you're immune to certain things
[33:43] but you're not immune to everything
[33:45] right you can still sin you can still do
[33:47] things wrong you can still have bad
[33:48] thoughts and bad days and all those
[33:50] things that's just a human when we come
[33:52] down here to get into this part that's
[33:54] where all that is um had a brother not
[33:57] too long ago uh even uh he's he's trying
[34:01] to preach to his group sinless
[34:04] Perfection and he even said this is a
[34:06] quote out of his mouth he said he said I
[34:10] wish brother brandham had have never
[34:11] made that quote about remember brother
[34:12] BR said this thing will be sticky until
[34:15] the day we're changed now I want y'all
[34:17] to realize something we are going
[34:19] through a gradual change but it's not
[34:21] that this arm's going to change first
[34:24] and then then my leg's going to change
[34:27] no the Bible says changed in a moment in
[34:29] the twinkling of an eye this whole being
[34:31] is going to be changed all right so it's
[34:34] not going to be just part of my mind is
[34:36] going to get where I don't have any bad
[34:37] thoughts I mean I can't I can't see how
[34:40] a preacher could stand up in a pull pit
[34:41] and say I wish brother BR had said
[34:45] that wish he had have said
[34:48] that I think he was telling the honest
[34:52] truth he was a human he knew he was a
[34:55] prophet stood right there with God but
[34:57] he knew he had problems so do you and
[35:01] I but the rest of this creation Now look
[35:06] he started there in Genesis what we were
[35:08] talking about was fashioning and
[35:10] developing and bringing something
[35:12] together to bring it to
[35:15] Earth and put it in Earth yeah that was
[35:19] the whole deal bring it to Earth and put
[35:22] it in Earth that's what he did he
[35:23] brought it to Earth put it in Adam right
[35:26] 27 man brought it to Earth and put it in
[35:28] now exactly what's he doing now he's
[35:31] working right back the same way amen
[35:33] he's come to Earth brought us the word
[35:35] and he's putting it in earth right so it
[35:38] didn't stop God's plan it just kind of
[35:40] lengthened it a little bit kind of let a
[35:42] lot of other people come in what a
[35:44] gracious God we serve
[35:47] Glory all right let's look at number one
[35:49] let's read this I want you to I want you
[35:51] to watch because I think where we're
[35:54] missing it at we're we're speaking of
[35:56] all these things and and and the bride
[35:58] is the fullness of the godhead bodily I
[36:00] agree 100% but do we believe it right
[36:03] now yeah right to believe it's right now
[36:07] or do you believe when we get good
[36:09] enough it's
[36:12] coming this thing's been done since the
[36:14] foundation of the
[36:17] world signed sealed and delivered but we
[36:21] had to go through this Final Destination
[36:24] to get I mean to get to this Final
[36:26] Destination we to go through a journey
[36:28] all right we had to live and and look at
[36:31] the attributes of God that are being
[36:32] displayed instead of just
[36:34] father I really appreciate God doing
[36:37] that because we see him in all the other
[36:39] attributes but watch this right here
[36:40] power of transformation 1965 now also we
[36:43] find out that when he come in talk about
[36:46] Satan he deformed that seed and he
[36:48] corrupted that seed now he didn't bring
[36:50] a seed he just corrupted
[36:53] it by getting into the Bing ground which
[36:56] was e even corrupted that seed with a
[36:58] corruptible seed before it could get
[37:00] there to corrupt that beautiful Garden
[37:02] of Eden where where Heaven the only
[37:05] thing that that is is just the
[37:08] restoration where we are now we are on
[37:12] our road back to that original beginning
[37:15] of the creation of God Amen you believe
[37:18] that right amen we still believe the
[37:21] prophet okay back to the Garden of Eden
[37:25] again husband and and wife without
[37:28] without any sin or anything to live
[37:32] eternally all right now watch this one
[37:34] for all of you that think that
[37:35] something's
[37:36] coming number two
[37:41] 1956 is not after the seals this is
[37:45] before fellowship with God through
[37:47] reconciliation you'll never be able to
[37:49] have too much fellowship with God and
[37:50] God Longs for his creature who he
[37:53] created in his enemies now what's he
[37:55] going back to Genesis 1
[37:57] he created in His image to fellowship
[37:59] with him wouldn't you love to have lived
[38:01] in that time when the Great Fellowship
[38:03] God had with Adam and Eve in the Garden
[38:05] of Eden he's asking a question to come
[38:07] down in the cool of the evening and talk
[38:09] with them and fellowship with them
[38:11] wouldn't that be
[38:12] marvelous we all would like to have that
[38:15] time but read that red letter now I
[38:18] Believe by God's word I can prove to you
[38:20] that we can come right back on them
[38:23] terms again with God next week
[38:27] in 20
[38:29] years
[38:32] tonight right straight back to that kind
[38:35] of Fellowship now he had no
[38:37] problem seeing us restored right he had
[38:41] no problem 1956 the seals hadn't opened
[38:44] the seals had not been
[38:47] loosed
[38:49] wow number
[38:51] three law in Chicago
[38:54] Illinois God's Great holy Spirit moving
[38:57] in the hearts of people now who he's
[38:59] talking about now everybody understand
[39:00] that he's talking about now I shorten
[39:01] these a little bit for a Time bringing
[39:05] that Eve and Adam together again in
[39:08] their perfection God's holiness God's
[39:12] Perfection God's Great Holy Spirit now
[39:14] that is that what you receiv received
[39:15] with a new birth amen amen so you
[39:19] receive God's holiness you receive
[39:20] receive God's
[39:22] Perfection I said God's
[39:25] Perfection okay not yours God's
[39:27] Perfection you're being perfected by
[39:29] what's in the earth remember he came on
[39:32] the earth to go in the Earth all right
[39:34] now he's got to restore that Earth back
[39:36] now let's read number four and then
[39:38] we'll make a few comments Feast of the
[39:41] trumpets we quote this one so let's
[39:42] quote it again
[39:44] 1964 now while that group is a writing
[39:47] making themsel ready to stomp out
[39:48] everything that won't agree with them
[39:50] there's another group being made
[39:53] ready we always talk about the
[39:57] Devil's writers and the devil's people
[39:59] making things ready well you know as we
[40:01] teach it around here and and uh brother
[40:04] Dale in the 80s there brought out the uh
[40:06] the seals is for the Redemption of of
[40:08] the of the Saints it's not for anything
[40:10] to do with the devil yeah sure it
[40:12] exposes him but it's for our Perfection
[40:15] that's why the seals were Loos the seals
[40:17] weren Loos to show you what the devil
[40:20] was it showed you who you were and that
[40:23] showed who the devil was all right cuz
[40:26] remember will you see it in opposition
[40:27] anything that's in you that's in
[40:28] opposition to God you know one thing for
[40:31] sure that's the devil all
[40:33] right after a while Revelations 19 the
[40:37] next time the church is heard she comes
[40:38] also but not upon exact horses but the
[40:41] Bible said he was on a white horse and
[40:43] the host of heaven was following him
[40:44] upon White Horse is that right while
[40:47] this group down here has got 2,000 bound
[40:50] at the river Euphrates has been bound
[40:51] for 2,000 years also that church has
[40:54] bound the Holy Ghost
[40:57] right for nearly 2,000 years under
[40:59] martyrdom back there that's right see
[41:02] they had the
[41:03] power they had the Holy Ghost but they
[41:05] didn't have the character to go with it
[41:07] not totally all right martyrdom back
[41:10] there and under the church ages it's
[41:11] been bound not at the river Euphrates
[41:13] but at the door of Creeds and dogmas
[41:16] that the Holy Spirit can't work it
[41:17] didn't say it didn't have the Holy
[41:19] Spirit he said it can't work right in
[41:23] the church because of man-made systems
[41:25] like brother was talking about the life
[41:27] came through those
[41:30] churches come on the two shoes had life
[41:33] that's where the life come from you cut
[41:34] it down you don't have anymore so that
[41:36] had the life in it stop then you come
[41:39] out to the full grain but it's got to
[41:40] come back to the grain it's got to come
[41:42] back to watch this but she is going to
[41:46] be liberated
[41:48] amen she is coming back that's what the
[41:52] Bible said and these two meet one
[41:55] another on the Battleground l Lucifer
[41:56] and Michael again like in the beginning
[41:58] they've been bound for 2,000 years
[42:00] almost almost
[42:01] 2,000 years the Holy Spirit can't work
[42:04] in the church why because of Creeds and
[42:07] dogmas for the things that we have have
[42:10] bound you see where it says bound and
[42:13] then we see where the seals loosed all
[42:16] right but you see that you say what's
[42:18] this got to do with Genesis 126 man well
[42:20] that 126 man listen the Genesis 126 man
[42:24] doesn't need Redemption we've already
[42:25] said that okay the genesis6 man is
[42:28] perfect the Genesis 126 man is the word
[42:34] Amen period Amen in the beginning was
[42:37] the word word was with God and Word was
[42:39] God and that word came on Earth and went
[42:43] in Earth in 14 and the Word was made
[42:46] flesh sure that is for Jesus but we got
[42:49] to realize that's for me and you right
[42:52] that's why the Son of God down through
[42:54] the church ages couldn't work like he
[42:57] wanted to the son of man had to come
[43:01] back cuz he'd been
[43:03] bound the Holy Ghost is the Son of God
[43:06] everybody understand that say Amen all
[43:08] right remember he was son of man he died
[43:11] son of man he rose Son of God well see
[43:12] when he come back on the day of
[43:13] Pentecost there was the son of God made
[43:16] manifest sure it was God in flesh right
[43:20] but it wasn't God in flesh to loose the
[43:23] seals everybody understand that it's
[43:25] like talking about the other day uh you
[43:28] got to see that uh somebody made an
[43:30] analogy and I like it it's it's like an
[43:33] onion
[43:33] peel if you ever tried to really peel an
[43:36] onion it's just real thin it's kind of
[43:38] like kind of like the you know the pages
[43:40] in The Bible but you keep pulling it
[43:42] back you see more of the onion right
[43:45] okay so that's the same way with God
[43:47] this Genesis 126 man has always been in
[43:50] power but when it when the fall happened
[43:52] and God had to do what he did come the
[43:54] way he did in flesh and put us in flesh
[43:57] there was still a barrier
[43:59] there right 126 couldn't work in its
[44:03] fullness because remember 126 worked in
[44:05] his fullness in Adam right amen
[44:09] amen move tree go lay down I'm going to
[44:14] name all these animals I'm going to do
[44:16] this there was no
[44:18] fear okay so there was the
[44:21] power and Adam had the character but he
[44:24] didn't have all of it cuz he was n the
[44:26] fullness of the godhead
[44:27] bodily that's why the fullness of the
[44:29] godhead bodily had to
[44:31] come Jesus Christ himself had to come
[44:34] with us in him all right Adam was going
[44:37] to be able
[44:38] to speak the word maybe and us come into
[44:43] being but he wasn't the Big G he was a
[44:47] little
[44:48] G the Big G had everything in him little
[44:52] G Adam had a part but now remember when
[44:56] we're taking it back to the Garden we'll
[44:58] read it in just a little while in Christ
[44:59] the mystery God
[45:01] reveal but the son of man is what the
[45:04] reason the son of man had to come back
[45:05] in the end time is to bring all the
[45:07] attributes of that 126 man not not not
[45:12] from somewhere else that's our problem
[45:14] we think we got to get it from somewhere
[45:17] else the inexhaustible Fountain is in
[45:19] you tonight if you're born again GL the
[45:22] whole Genesis 126 man that you were back
[45:25] before the beginning of time is in you
[45:27] if you're born again it's not coming
[45:29] from somewhere
[45:32] right if it's coming from somewhere
[45:34] you're not born again
[45:36] right that's what I told him I
[45:39] said I'm sorry I Church means more to me
[45:43] than than anything
[45:46] right right the Bible says and much more
[45:50] as the day
[45:51] approaches now what's our problem do we
[45:55] not think the day is
[45:57] approaching cuz if you don't go to
[45:58] church more now than you did 6 months
[46:01] ago or a year ago you don't think the
[46:03] Lord's coming right I'm sorry I told him
[46:06] downstairs I said you're either backslid
[46:08] or lost one of the two yeah backslid or
[46:11] lost hey I I feed it to them in Sunday
[46:14] school and they must like it cuz they
[46:16] fill the room up
[46:18] so but I try to tell them the truth like
[46:21] Daddy I don't soft soap
[46:23] it I don't want to
[46:26] I don't want the devil to pull something
[46:28] over on he's already pulled enough over
[46:29] on us he pulls enough over on me to make
[46:32] up for you he don't pull anything over
[46:34] on you he's done it to me
[46:37] twice but now
[46:41] remember let's get back to Revelations 5
[46:44] when those seals were loosed that loosed
[46:47] it didn't take and
[46:50] give power remember power was given to
[46:53] the devil to do things it never says
[46:56] that about us right we have the power
[46:59] sister Gale we have the power right
[47:02] brother BR said you have enough power to
[47:04] go create a
[47:07] world
[47:09] why cuz you got that in you the
[47:12] Creator's in
[47:14] you but the bar
[47:16] is we can't do it right
[47:20] now say it again sister Trudy unb thank
[47:23] you amen unbelief right that's the bar
[47:29] right because
[47:31] remember if you're born again tonight
[47:34] you are creating another
[47:39] world you are creating another
[47:42] world and you are going to live on it
[47:45] cuz when John saw the holy city what did
[47:48] he see he said it look
[47:53] like the bride amen
[47:56] Adorn for a husband right so it was all
[47:59] the
[48:00] bride so you're building your own part
[48:03] of the
[48:06] Kingdom that's why I say we we we've got
[48:09] this problem where where we think we got
[48:11] to go get
[48:13] something we already got it in us right
[48:17] I I just want us to release it get it
[48:18] out let it work let it do the things
[48:21] it's supposed to
[48:23] do but now remember
[48:27] it couldn't happen in the first
[48:29] age it couldn't happen in the second
[48:32] age couldn't happen in the third
[48:35] age because number one the fullness had
[48:37] got here yet right now remember we're
[48:40] not the fullness but I'm talking about
[48:42] our part of the fullness hadn't got here
[48:45] yet remember there was promised seven
[48:47] Church ages right can't can't do away
[48:50] with God's word but we were still in
[48:53] this earth while all these promises were
[48:56] being made but you and I God saw us come
[49:01] in this last age to bring and then he
[49:03] brought a
[49:04] prophet to speak to
[49:08] us not 1964
[49:11] people not 1965
[49:15] people he said it's gone from you you're
[49:18] not going to get it it's not even for
[49:20] you right well who was it for then was
[49:23] he wasting his
[49:24] time no it was for somebody to pick up
[49:27] the voice sir right amen what it was at
[49:30] Genesis 1:26 man hearing right from the
[49:34] Creator again but it had to be a son of
[49:37] man to loose the
[49:40] seals because it had to be a flesh man
[49:44] right it's just too simple like brother
[49:47] brandom said it's just it's just God and
[49:50] simplicity the reason that we see that
[49:52] we act
[49:54] different come on baby people we're
[49:56] supposed to anyway than the other ages
[50:00] we're supposed to act different than the
[50:01] other ages even Paul Paul said I see
[50:04] through a glass Darkly they without us
[50:06] not be made perfect he's G he's
[50:08] prophesying he's prophesying he's
[50:10] prophesying who are we prophesying
[50:13] about I want to know we don't get up and
[50:17] prophesy
[50:20] anymore this is a reality amen that's
[50:24] our problem we look looking for another
[50:26] prophecy to come we may not be in our
[50:28] own we know in our own psyche we're not
[50:30] looking for another Prophet to come or
[50:33] looking for but I told him a long time
[50:35] ago and and it goes out on the internet
[50:37] and you can listen to it if you want
[50:39] to Satan's going to bring somebody in
[50:42] this message you hear what I said Satan
[50:45] he's going to give him Supernatural
[50:46] gifts he's going to give him a healing
[50:49] campaign and the people are going to
[50:51] flock right to that man like you've
[50:54] never seen it before and they ain't
[50:56] going to care what he preaches right you
[50:59] mark my word somebody that's what 90% of
[51:02] the people are waiting on is for
[51:03] somebody to raise up and do what brother
[51:06] brandom did right not this church amen
[51:11] you know why because they're
[51:14] waiting we're not waiting
[51:19] right signs and wonders are
[51:23] okay but to be the expressed attribute
[51:26] of God right is what God
[51:29] wants God wants his kids to act like
[51:32] kids because they are his kids and I
[51:35] ain't talking about kids I ain't talking
[51:37] about
[51:38] kids I'm talking about the children of
[51:41] God Richard back there laughing
[51:44] right but now
[51:47] remember you remember we went through
[51:49] and and let's pull them up and and look
[51:51] at them because I was looking at them
[51:53] the other day and this is what I was
[51:54] getting to we're doing this um series on
[51:57] the Statue of a perfect man
[51:59] downstairs and we're bringing Faith
[52:01] virtue knowledge Temperance patience
[52:02] godl brotherly kindness and I kind of
[52:04] wanted to bring
[52:05] in let's look up let's look at
[52:09] created Brother Anderson must be with
[52:11] the baby no baby's back there
[52:13] okay but now
[52:15] look and I want you to look at these
[52:19] because remember this is the whole part
[52:22] that we've been talking about in Genesis
[52:24] 1:26
[52:25] and we're going to read through them and
[52:27] then we're going to make a few comments
[52:29] because to me I think
[52:32] now probably the greatest outside the
[52:35] seals the greatest sermon brother Brown
[52:37] preached was the Statue of a perfect man
[52:40] yeah because he didn't bring the
[52:43] power the power was already here brother
[52:45] Brown did not change the way the New
[52:47] Birth come he did not change the way we
[52:49] get the Holy
[52:51] Ghost right and he didn't come to bring
[52:53] us a new Holy Ghost that's right it was
[52:56] the same Holy Ghost it was the power but
[52:59] now he's putting character on top of
[53:01] that power because power without
[53:04] character is satanic right but Power
[53:06] with character is fit to rule but now
[53:09] could we say power without the virtues
[53:11] and that's what it was it God wasn't
[53:13] going to wasn't going to let Peter stand
[53:16] up on the day of
[53:18] Pentecost and him just get born again
[53:20] like the 3000 Peter wouldn't had nothing
[53:22] to say right cuz remember in the to
[53:25] 3,000 said men and Brethren what must we
[53:27] do to be saved that's all they knew what
[53:28] to say but Peter gets up and preaches
[53:30] them a sermon why Peter had the virtue
[53:35] Peter had that he had when the Holy
[53:37] Ghost came and quickened what he
[53:41] held that's right that sound familiar
[53:44] Quicken what he held he used that not as
[53:48] a satanic power but as a power of God as
[53:51] a conduit to get that power back to that
[53:53] 3,000 downstairs 3,000 downstairs had no
[53:56] power that's right before they were born
[53:59] again they didn't even know how to get
[54:01] it men and Brethren what must we do to
[54:03] be saved they were lost that's right but
[54:06] Peter showed them how to get there but
[54:08] now watch created remember God created
[54:12] man in his own image so this word
[54:14] created is to shape fashion create
[54:18] always with God is
[54:20] subject of Heaven and Earth of
[54:24] individual man
[54:26] and watch this one of new conditions and
[54:30] circumstances so God
[54:35] fashioned this Genesis 1 126 man not
[54:39] create is what we said from nothing to
[54:41] something he's bringing it out into a
[54:44] new
[54:45] condition and a
[54:47] circumstance because see at Faith and on
[54:51] the bottom of the pyramid now I'm not
[54:53] going to put all these together that's
[54:54] what that's why I believe the Lord said
[54:55] well let them figure it out let you do a
[54:58] little studying cuz I'm going to tell
[55:00] you that that word when you see number
[55:01] one there and
[55:03] created go back to your new
[55:06] birth the beginning of the creation of
[55:09] God and you're the continuation of that
[55:11] creation your beginning of the creation
[55:13] of God was the day you got born again it
[55:15] wasn't the day you were born on the
[55:17] Earth it was the day you got born again
[55:20] God put you in a new condition and
[55:22] Circumstance he shaped you he fashioned
[55:24] you
[55:26] is that okay so there's the bottom of
[55:28] the pyramid then if you go all the way
[55:30] up to the last one
[55:33] Dominion remember the last thing he said
[55:35] roll it all the way up we'll not get we
[55:37] we'll read those
[55:38] later me going up right there Dominion
[55:41] to
[55:43] rule brother BR said how does a
[55:45] Christian rule
[55:48] right that's right with love see when we
[55:52] see these and we see dominion and
[55:53] rulership we think oh this
[55:56] no no that's love right that's the love
[56:01] of God right so you see the first and
[56:03] last so then you put Faith virtue
[56:04] knowledge Temperance patience godliness
[56:06] brotherly kindness you read through
[56:08] those you do a little homework cuz look
[56:11] watch these things God created and it's
[56:13] kind of it's kind of outstanding that
[56:16] there was eight of these what I call
[56:19] blessings on this Genesis 126 man and
[56:22] there's
[56:23] also you say oh no there's seven sure
[56:25] there's seven ads in the Statue of a
[56:27] perfect man but there's eight
[56:29] manifestations I I was thinking about
[56:31] today you know you got to have those
[56:32] eight manifestations if you stay at
[56:34] seven then you stay just you stay
[56:37] Earthly sure we know that's completion
[56:39] but but remember brother brandham takes
[56:42] and puts us in an eighth day amen he
[56:45] puts that holy city in an eighth day
[56:47] right so Adam and Eve was potentially
[56:49] you hear me potentially was in an eighth
[56:52] day I said potentially cuz they didn't
[56:54] have Eternal bodies but potentially they
[56:57] were heading toward that Brother Gary
[57:00] they were heading toward
[57:04] something we're headed toward something
[57:06] I
[57:07] hope but look at this image likess
[57:13] reflection what does that happen in the
[57:15] Statue of a perfect man what are we
[57:18] reflecting Jesus
[57:21] Christ look blessed to be adored to pray
[57:25] fruitful to show fruitfulness or to bear
[57:27] fruit well that's absolutely the
[57:30] fruits the statue of a perfect man
[57:33] amen that's why I'm telling you nobody
[57:36] taught this down through the church
[57:38] ages
[57:40] nobody Peter put it in the word of God
[57:44] but nobody brought that together to show
[57:47] that those were the virtues of God
[57:49] surely they sure I'm sure they read it
[57:51] and said well we need to be like God cuz
[57:52] it say godliness we need to be like this
[57:54] we need to do this but brother Brandon
[57:56] breaks those down and tells us he says
[57:58] look these are requirements why he knows
[58:01] we got the
[58:02] power but without the
[58:05] character we're not going to take a body
[58:07] change if we don't have the character
[58:09] let me just put it down in simple terms
[58:11] you're not going to take the body change
[58:13] at Faith right you're going to get your
[58:16] body changed at Faith yeah you
[58:18] understand what I'm
[58:19] saying because you're going in the
[58:21] ground and you're going to get your body
[58:23] changed but to get a body changed here
[58:25] on the earth see that Genesis 126
[58:29] man if all his power was released
[58:32] because
[58:33] remember listen listen to me when Jesus
[58:37] stood on Earth after the resurrection he
[58:40] said all power in heaven now where were
[58:43] we where were we at that moment right if
[58:46] you're a Christian if you're born again
[58:47] tonight where were you when Jesus said
[58:50] all power in heaven and in Earth has
[58:53] been given unto me right and he was
[58:55] standing there in a glorified
[58:57] body oh it ought to make you
[59:00] happy that's why I like the Bible says
[59:03] we're preserved in him right that's
[59:05] where we were we were preserved in that
[59:07] man and when what he said brother Chris
[59:09] I'm just going to try to believe from
[59:11] now on that he's talking to me sister
[59:13] Gil right that he's telling me
[59:17] that you know who I believe Jesus stood
[59:20] up and he said devil all power
[59:25] you ain't got this baby no more it's
[59:28] ain't yours I have got the title deed
[59:31] back well now remember the title deed
[59:33] was a book of
[59:35] names it wasn't the title deed to the
[59:37] Earth like like I bought a car from
[59:39] brother Mark and he gives me a title and
[59:41] now I got a
[59:42] car he didn't lose the Adam didn't lose
[59:45] the title deed to the Earth like he had
[59:47] to give him a deed right no he lost
[59:50] ability for me and you to come that
[59:53] way so what is Jesus saying when he gets
[59:56] here all power in heaven and earth been
[59:58] given unto me
[1:00:00] amen and where were we we were right
[1:00:03] there inside of him amen not a second
[1:00:06] person not a third person right fruitful
[1:00:10] multiply to become great to increase
[1:00:13] greatly exceedingly to make great to
[1:00:16] enlarge to do much wow that word
[1:00:19] multiply now what are we doing with
[1:00:21] these same with the
[1:00:23] virtues somebody got to come to that
[1:00:25] position to bring others right exactly
[1:00:28] that's where the multiplying is coming
[1:00:31] from Peter on the day of Pentecost one
[1:00:34] man preached a 40 minute sermon that's
[1:00:37] what the prophet said a 40 how you knew
[1:00:40] that I don't know a 40 minute sermon and
[1:00:43] 3,000 people
[1:00:45] right that's right what a sermon
[1:00:49] accepted Christ 3,000 people from One
[1:00:53] sermon we we hardly can stay awake for
[1:00:57] one well somebody said
[1:01:04] amen I believe we're just missing
[1:01:06] it I believe we are looking
[1:01:09] for something to happen or or or or we
[1:01:14] maybe that Genesis 126 will will come
[1:01:16] into power
[1:01:18] sometime if we keep thinking that
[1:01:21] that's if we keep thinking that we're
[1:01:24] either going to go to the Grave or we
[1:01:25] ain't got to start with cuz somebody's
[1:01:27] got to become the positive when Jesus
[1:01:29] stood and said all power in heaven and
[1:01:30] earth been given unto me he did not turn
[1:01:32] around and
[1:01:35] see if anybody believed
[1:01:39] it brother Chris he believed it himself
[1:01:42] amen remember what brother Bram said
[1:01:45] even God when he created the world he
[1:01:46] said he just believed himself he just
[1:01:48] believed brother Bob he just believed
[1:01:50] that when he said it it
[1:01:51] happened what about us
[1:01:55] but you come through watch replenish
[1:01:57] fullness abundance to be full to be
[1:02:01] accomplished to be ended I like that one
[1:02:05] right because this is the finality this
[1:02:07] is the final destination of the Genesis
[1:02:09] 126 person is to replenish this Earth
[1:02:13] and subdue it right to subject and
[1:02:17] Dominion is to rule let's read number
[1:02:21] five statue of a perfect man
[1:02:25] these fellas wasn't required what these
[1:02:27] fellas are now I'm sure he's pointing to
[1:02:29] the church ages don't you everybody okay
[1:02:31] with that these fellas he's pointing at
[1:02:34] the church
[1:02:35] ages wasn't required what these fellas
[1:02:38] are this wasn't required what this was I
[1:02:41] believe he was pointing at church agents
[1:02:42] now is that okay I'm not putting any
[1:02:45] words in his mouth but what fellas is he
[1:02:46] talking about he's talking about the
[1:02:48] church down through the church ages but
[1:02:51] he brought his church up the same way he
[1:02:54] brought his church up the same way he's
[1:02:56] bringing his people up what through
[1:03:00] justification sanctification baptism of
[1:03:01] the Holy Ghost did y'all notice the
[1:03:04] other day brother Bob brought out an
[1:03:05] outstanding statement last Wednesday
[1:03:06] about the uh Pope and the Methodist
[1:03:10] signing the decree in
[1:03:11] 1999 then in 2006 I mean the lutherans
[1:03:15] and then in
[1:03:17] 2006 the wans right and then in
[1:03:22] 2013 it's when they got to the
[1:03:24] Pentecostal people do you know that
[1:03:25] seven years between every one of them
[1:03:29] yeah see Satan has a completion too
[1:03:33] right he's got a completion it was from
[1:03:36] 1999 to 06 is 7 years from 06 to 2013 7
[1:03:40] years right could there be in the next
[1:03:42] seven
[1:03:43] years that we get out of here I sure
[1:03:46] hope
[1:03:47] so I ain't looking for seven years but
[1:03:50] could it
[1:03:51] be because remember Satan's a copy cat
[1:03:54] always he always copies after all right
[1:03:59] then Peter here says first seven things
[1:04:01] Faith virtue seek come up knowledge
[1:04:03] Temperance patience godliness Brotherly
[1:04:05] Love add brotherly kindness then the
[1:04:07] love of God the Holy Ghost Christ in the
[1:04:09] person of the Holy Ghost comes upon you
[1:04:12] in the true baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:04:14] now
[1:04:16] remember a lot of people have form
[1:04:18] doctrines around that that you don't get
[1:04:20] the new birth until you get to where it
[1:04:22] says holy spirit now we know that's
[1:04:23] false right cuz brother Bown says and
[1:04:26] and and you know what let me put it this
[1:04:29] way it doesn't matter what brother Brown
[1:04:30] said about
[1:04:31] it I know that when I got born again I
[1:04:34] was born again at Faith right cuzz I
[1:04:36] didn't have virtue I had to acquire that
[1:04:39] right that was something that had to be
[1:04:41] birthed in me all right it wasn't that I
[1:04:43] had all it's like even even brother
[1:04:45] Buster across the street he's one he's
[1:04:47] been listening to my or watching my um
[1:04:51] Sunday school class downstairs and he
[1:04:53] said I thought you you got all that when
[1:04:54] you got born again he said but you
[1:04:56] proved that through the Bible that
[1:04:58] that's not true so he's teaching his
[1:05:01] people right that they need virtue after
[1:05:04] they become a Christian that they need
[1:05:05] knowledge after they become a Christian
[1:05:08] now where they are in the body that's
[1:05:10] God that's that's for God to place
[1:05:12] them but at least they knew something
[1:05:15] that they previously didn't know all
[1:05:17] right but he said he you know he
[1:05:19] appreciated it and I do I appreciate
[1:05:21] people listening and taking it instead
[1:05:23] of just it just being a formality but
[1:05:26] you need to pray for him too his wife
[1:05:27] said the other day I saw in the
[1:05:28] restaurant to really pray for him
[1:05:30] because he's got a lot of fluid and he's
[1:05:32] retaining fluid he was in the hospital
[1:05:34] not too long ago but he's out so just
[1:05:36] pray for him he he's a good brother he's
[1:05:38] a good he's a good guy the Holy Ghost
[1:05:40] Christ in the person of the Holy Ghost
[1:05:42] comes upon you in the true baptism now
[1:05:44] that doesn't mean you got a false one
[1:05:45] and then you got a true one like it says
[1:05:48] the faithful and true witness the
[1:05:50] beginning of the creation of God not as
[1:05:51] in true versus false but it brings us
[1:05:55] now remember see right here because it
[1:05:57] says and you got all these virtues
[1:05:59] sealed in
[1:06:00] you see you get the Holy Ghost as a baby
[1:06:03] right you act like a baby right cry like
[1:06:06] a baby walk like a baby but when you get
[1:06:10] here this is the Holy Ghost himself this
[1:06:13] is the true
[1:06:14] person not that you didn't get the true
[1:06:16] person but this is the true person
[1:06:18] working in your person right all right
[1:06:21] is that okay that did I say that all
[1:06:23] right
[1:06:24] I mean it's it's the Holy Ghost the
[1:06:26] whole time but what it is remember if if
[1:06:30] it was bound in the church ages who
[1:06:32] bound it right
[1:06:35] people religious people the devil didn't
[1:06:39] bind it religious people bound
[1:06:41] it I just got that myself religious
[1:06:45] people bound
[1:06:48] it through Creeds and dogmas so can we
[1:06:51] be doing the same thing yes we can
[1:06:54] right all right but when you see this
[1:06:57] comes upon you in the true baptism of
[1:06:59] the Holy Ghost and you get all these
[1:07:01] virtues sealed in you
[1:07:04] sealed in you right then God lives in a
[1:07:08] tabernacle called the building the
[1:07:10] living Tabernacle of the living God's
[1:07:12] Dwelling Place amen now look paragraph
[1:07:16] 342 I made that real big they didn't
[1:07:18] make it real
[1:07:20] big least real big on mine because
[1:07:23] remember
[1:07:25] remember when a man
[1:07:29] possesses these kind of things right
[1:07:34] what the virtues
[1:07:36] possesses possesses that means it's
[1:07:39] mine right you give it to me it's
[1:07:42] mine right when a man
[1:07:45] possesses see that's what I'm telling
[1:07:47] you you've got the new birth if you're
[1:07:48] born again if you got you've got the new
[1:07:50] birth if you're not I hope you don't
[1:07:51] sleep till you get
[1:07:52] it I hope God stirs your water so hard
[1:07:55] till you don't you can't sleep and you
[1:07:57] just God just here I am amen and all of
[1:08:02] us that's been born again we need to say
[1:08:03] the same thing too right God fill us
[1:08:05] some more right but when a man possesses
[1:08:08] these kind of things then the Holy Ghost
[1:08:11] comes upon him right it's another
[1:08:14] anointing that's what I was saying the
[1:08:15] other day they there like that onion
[1:08:17] peel let me get back to that because
[1:08:19] there there's things for the
[1:08:21] ages everybody got me right now there's
[1:08:23] things for the church ages there's
[1:08:25] things for the Born Again believer but
[1:08:28] when this message come there will
[1:08:30] something come on top of
[1:08:34] that amen so we can talk about the new
[1:08:38] birth and it being baby form but we can
[1:08:41] talk about the new birth and it be it
[1:08:43] the Holy Spirit and not have a problem
[1:08:45] with that amen amen so it's not brother
[1:08:49] Bown didn't bring us something
[1:08:52] new
[1:08:55] let me put it this
[1:08:56] way Christ didn't come to bring us our
[1:08:59] inheritance is that right he came to get
[1:09:03] us the way back to that
[1:09:06] inheritance now let me be easy with
[1:09:10] this the Holy Ghost through brother
[1:09:16] brandham did the same
[1:09:18] thing cuz if we've been bound we were
[1:09:21] bound under Creeds and dogmas all of us
[1:09:24] were and sure it was loosed by Christ
[1:09:27] but it had to come
[1:09:29] through not the son of man but a son of
[1:09:32] man which was God in human flesh so are
[1:09:35] you if you're born again but brother
[1:09:37] brandham was a conduit to bring us to
[1:09:41] our inheritance now our inheritance from
[1:09:44] William
[1:09:45] brandham come on was a change of the
[1:09:49] body now that wasn't Paul's commission
[1:09:52] right that wasn't irenius that wasn't
[1:09:54] Martin that wasn't columus that wasn't
[1:09:56] Luther that wasn't Wesley that wasn't
[1:09:58] their
[1:09:59] commission so brother Bram didn't bring
[1:10:02] us a new
[1:10:05] way is that okay without making him God
[1:10:09] he wasn't God but he brought us back to
[1:10:12] God Amen He restored he was a restorer
[1:10:15] amen He restored us back if we'll just
[1:10:19] listen to him right here when a man
[1:10:22] possesses listen to the things he says
[1:10:24] when a man possesses these kind of
[1:10:26] things right then the Holy Ghost comes
[1:10:28] upon him no matter you might speak with
[1:10:30] tongues you might impersonate any gift
[1:10:32] that God has got you might do that but
[1:10:36] until these virtues here go into you
[1:10:40] right you're still off the real true
[1:10:43] foundation of Faith right exactly wow
[1:10:47] and you got the new birth at
[1:10:49] Faith but the real true foundation
[1:10:52] Brother Gary for us is to body
[1:10:55] change so we've got this layer that we
[1:10:58] that we see that that this layer of the
[1:11:00] new birth that we
[1:11:03] have and that put the people in the body
[1:11:05] of Christ that brought that Genesis 126
[1:11:08] back in power
[1:11:11] partially CU remember they bound
[1:11:17] it brother Dale the other day the true
[1:11:20] bride went to
[1:11:22] NAA well see they went back and bound it
[1:11:25] right the de I mean it wasn't the people
[1:11:28] in the bars that bound it right it was
[1:11:31] the religious people it went back to
[1:11:33] their churches that's right and took
[1:11:35] Holy Father Son Holy Ghost baptism God
[1:11:37] winked at that ignorance those people
[1:11:39] had the Holy Ghost that's that's kind of
[1:11:41] hard to understand but it's a truth
[1:11:44] Martin
[1:11:44] Luther had the Genesis 126 man inside of
[1:11:48] him but that Genesis one man never
[1:11:50] literally baptized anybody in the name
[1:11:52] of Father Son and Holy Ghost CU that's
[1:11:54] contrary to the word so it was contrary
[1:11:59] but Martin Luther bound
[1:12:03] it by his Creeds amen that's right you
[1:12:07] and I that's what brother Dell's doing
[1:12:09] every Sunday right he's getting our old
[1:12:12] Creeds and ideas sure we have the power
[1:12:15] sure we have the new
[1:12:18] birth that's the one layer of the onion
[1:12:20] peel right but there a lot more layers
[1:12:24] sir for us to build on to go to this
[1:12:28] stature of a perfect man so God's give
[1:12:30] us this final Journey or this final
[1:12:33] destination of the just Genesis 126 man
[1:12:36] sure the finality of the journey is is
[1:12:38] the future
[1:12:40] home CU that's and I'll read that in
[1:12:42] just a minute but now to get that
[1:12:47] finality we got to have something
[1:12:50] here
[1:12:51] right right we're not not going to get a
[1:12:53] change of the body in the future home
[1:12:56] we're not going to get a change of body
[1:12:57] in the Millennium right some will in the
[1:13:00] future home get a body change after they
[1:13:02] go through the white Throne judgment
[1:13:03] they'll get a body change
[1:13:07] right we get ours right here cuz this is
[1:13:11] where the Genesis 12 126 man was
[1:13:13] supposed to do everything right
[1:13:16] here on this Earth this is where we were
[1:13:19] to rule and Reign and subdue it and
[1:13:21] replenish and multiply I you're not
[1:13:24] getting it maybe you'll get it if I say
[1:13:25] it 15 more times you're supposed to say
[1:13:26] it 17 times I've already saying it
[1:13:29] twice but maybe with a visual we'll cut
[1:13:32] some of it
[1:13:33] down look when a man possesses all these
[1:13:37] kinds of things then the Holy Ghost
[1:13:38] comes upon him no matter you might speak
[1:13:40] with tongues you might impersonate any
[1:13:42] gift that God's Got You might do that
[1:13:44] but until these virtues here go into you
[1:13:47] you're still off the real true
[1:13:49] foundation of Faith but he didn't leave
[1:13:52] us out on a limb but when these virtues
[1:13:54] grow in so in other words they're not
[1:13:57] instantaneous they grow in amen all
[1:14:00] right you grow in Grace and knowledge
[1:14:03] and you add that to that then you are a
[1:14:07] living Monument you are a living moving
[1:14:10] Idol amen the prophet said paragraph
[1:14:14] 3:44 but when we not in an IM see what
[1:14:18] he's trying to
[1:14:19] do he says up there in 342 when a man
[1:14:22] possesses watch this but when we not in
[1:14:25] an imaginary
[1:14:27] way in an imaginary way we can say we've
[1:14:30] got virtue and faith and knowledge and
[1:14:32] Temperance and we got this and we've got
[1:14:33] that in an imaginary
[1:14:35] way but prostrate ourselves before a
[1:14:38] living God a living virtue a living
[1:14:41] knowledge a living patience a living
[1:14:43] godliness a living power coming from a
[1:14:46] living God makes a living man not a dead
[1:14:49] man a living man a Living eny Image in
[1:14:53] in the stature of God right what's he
[1:14:56] doing the same things that Jesus did I
[1:15:00] should have read letter that
[1:15:02] one the same things that Jesus did
[1:15:06] walking the same way he walked doing the
[1:15:08] same things he did because it's not
[1:15:12] imaginary things there's a reality that
[1:15:18] proves that's like we're on patience and
[1:15:20] brother Brown spent more time on temp
[1:15:23] and patience than he spent on all the
[1:15:25] others in the statute of a perfect man
[1:15:27] book he Temperance is where he said we
[1:15:29] fall off patience is where he said we
[1:15:31] fall off but see in in patience possess
[1:15:34] you your soul the Bible says possess ye
[1:15:36] your soul right in
[1:15:39] patience that's what we've got to come
[1:15:41] to that's why I said this statue of a
[1:15:43] perfect man to me has become more of a
[1:15:44] reality instead of just I got to have
[1:15:46] faith and I got to have virtue and I got
[1:15:48] to have knowledge
[1:15:50] no no it's a requirement but it ought to
[1:15:53] be like brother Brown said not an
[1:15:55] imaginary thing but a possession right
[1:15:58] our problem
[1:16:02] is our problem is it's become imaginary
[1:16:06] yeah well one day I'll get that when
[1:16:09] this certain thing happens I was
[1:16:11] thinking today when California sinks
[1:16:13] I'll just get better when this happens
[1:16:16] I'll just get better or when boy start
[1:16:19] speaking in tongues I'll start speaking
[1:16:20] in
[1:16:22] tongues
[1:16:25] no that's our
[1:16:27] problem that's our problem we're
[1:16:29] throwing it off on somebody else or
[1:16:31] someone else Jesus said all power in
[1:16:32] heaven and earth been given unto me like
[1:16:33] I said he didn't look around to see if
[1:16:34] anybody agreed with him right it becomes
[1:16:37] to an individual now watch this number
[1:16:42] six revelation of Jesus Christ Church
[1:16:45] age book when we see that when these
[1:16:48] last of Israel have been joined in love
[1:16:50] to the Lord and the enemy has been
[1:16:52] destroyed
[1:16:54] God will prepare His Holy Mountain his
[1:16:55] new Garden of Eden for the bride and his
[1:16:58] and her attendance for the Thousand-Year
[1:17:00] honeymoon upon the Earth as Adam and Eve
[1:17:03] were in the garden as Adam and Eve were
[1:17:06] in the garden and did not finish out the
[1:17:09] Thousand Years now Jesus our last Adam
[1:17:12] and his Eve true church right will
[1:17:16] fulfill all the plan of God
[1:17:21] Amen that's what's left for us to do
[1:17:24] that's our final destination fulfill the
[1:17:27] plan of God now the on just went on the
[1:17:28] grave they can't they fulfilled their
[1:17:30] part but the ones are still alive we got
[1:17:32] to part it we got to fulfill we're still
[1:17:34] part of the plan Christ The Mystery of
[1:17:36] God revealed number
[1:17:38] seven it's a revelation it's as Eternal
[1:17:41] as God's word is eternal look but the
[1:17:43] three-fold purpose of God's great
[1:17:44] mystery is
[1:17:46] revealed he didn't say it's going to be
[1:17:49] right exactly he said is revealed amen
[1:17:55] 1963 God manifested in Christ Christ
[1:17:58] manifested in the church in order right
[1:18:01] see in order to redeem the Lost Eve back
[1:18:05] to the original condition in the Garden
[1:18:09] of Eden oh my let me read that one more
[1:18:11] time God manifested in Christ Christ
[1:18:14] manifested in the church in order to
[1:18:17] redeem the Lost Eve back to the original
[1:18:22] condition right in the Garden of Eden oh
[1:18:25] my sometimes we miss these little quotes
[1:18:27] number eight future
[1:18:33] home then in this new Earth let's look
[1:18:36] at it for a few minutes in this new
[1:18:37] Earth the skies will never be black
[1:18:39] again no that's from the curse see never
[1:18:42] be black again with angry clouds winds
[1:18:44] will never blow across her again like
[1:18:46] that you know why that happens now
[1:18:50] there's no atoms on the earth to stop it
[1:18:52] right
[1:18:54] come on Adam could stop that when he was
[1:18:57] in the
[1:18:57] garden amen Adam could stop that when he
[1:19:01] was in the garden now we've seen it in
[1:19:03] his partiality here already we've seen
[1:19:05] it in individual we've seen it brother
[1:19:06] bradam we've seen it in our own church
[1:19:09] but remember God wants this thing to pop
[1:19:11] like firecrackers amen like the Roman
[1:19:14] Candle One go up eight go off out of
[1:19:17] that eight eight goes off of one eight
[1:19:18] goes off another eight goes off another
[1:19:21] he doesn't it's not for one man
[1:19:24] right it's not for one man it's not a
[1:19:26] one man
[1:19:28] show now she'll never tear up the trees
[1:19:31] and tear up the houses and turn over the
[1:19:32] things lightning and the Wrath will
[1:19:34] never belts from Satan that cross there
[1:19:36] and kill a man walking down the road or
[1:19:38] burn up a building see no no more
[1:19:41] there'll be no more typhoons sweep down
[1:19:43] or storms and tornadoes tear up houses
[1:19:45] and kill little children and things
[1:19:47] uhhuh won't be no more trying to destroy
[1:19:51] it won't be there
[1:19:53] Satan is cast out now where's he got to
[1:19:56] be cast out first right here
[1:19:59] right so you see why this is happening
[1:20:01] don't
[1:20:03] you cuz Satan's not all the way cast out
[1:20:05] of here right I'm talking about this man
[1:20:08] right all
[1:20:11] right wish we had time now I'm just
[1:20:14] passing scriptures now so it won't be
[1:20:16] too late I got to pray for the sick
[1:20:18] paragraph 274 Heaven and Earth heavens
[1:20:22] and earth
[1:20:23] have met remember the Bible always says
[1:20:26] Earth it says Heaven's plural but it
[1:20:29] only says Earth CU there's only one
[1:20:31] Earth right Isaiah 44 says I am God I
[1:20:35] made the Earth to be inhabited and you
[1:20:37] know what that's the way it's going to
[1:20:38] be this Earth is going to be inhabited
[1:20:40] by his people Heaven and Earth have
[1:20:44] met heavens and earth have met God and
[1:20:47] man is reconciled a restored Eden has
[1:20:51] begun amen see all the curse is
[1:20:54] gone just like
[1:20:57] listen just like now he's not putting
[1:21:01] this maybe so hope so when we get there
[1:21:05] it'll be
[1:21:06] so just like all the curse of sin is
[1:21:09] gone when the Holy Ghost
[1:21:12] accepts
[1:21:17] you not maybe not in a form not in a
[1:21:21] type literally see you don't accept it
[1:21:25] it accepts you amen see because it's
[1:21:28] God's
[1:21:29] attribute what we've been talking about
[1:21:32] see if it's the holy ghost means God's
[1:21:35] spirit and it's the attribute the
[1:21:38] thought of God has accepted you because
[1:21:42] that you were
[1:21:44] ordained for that
[1:21:46] purpose there's Genesis 1 there's the
[1:21:49] Final
[1:21:51] Destination
[1:21:53] see yet you were born in sin but God had
[1:21:57] that attribute and here you express
[1:22:00] yourself here on Earth and he comes down
[1:22:04] and gets
[1:22:05] you see you're back here here is where
[1:22:08] you
[1:22:10] belong see this is not where we belong
[1:22:13] not in this part not in this part of the
[1:22:15] earth not in this sin that's why it's
[1:22:17] all got to be wiped off here is where
[1:22:19] you belong sin has lost its power
[1:22:23] Glory huh sin has lost its what
[1:22:28] power that's right the desire of
[1:22:35] sin has gone from your heart right when
[1:22:39] the Holy Spirit comes in you are going
[1:22:43] to be a restored
[1:22:46] person oh that's not what he said you
[1:22:50] are a restored
[1:22:53] person let's stand stand to your
[1:22:58] feet we either going to have to start
[1:23:00] believing it are we going to keep
[1:23:01] falling by the wayside I I like I said
[1:23:04] we talking about
[1:23:07] patience Paul ran the race he said with
[1:23:11] patience we have to have patience
[1:23:14] brother Brown said with God first right
[1:23:17] not with each other with God right
[1:23:19] knowing that he'll do what he said he'll
[1:23:21] do amen
[1:23:24] but I like that where the Bible says in
[1:23:26] patience possess ye your soul now that's
[1:23:29] the real you that's the theophany that's
[1:23:31] the real person amen amen possess ye
[1:23:35] your soul in patience study the virtues
[1:23:39] put it with this Genesis 126 because you
[1:23:41] know what that is
[1:23:43] exactly where these virtues come from
[1:23:47] right they come from that Genesis 1:26
[1:23:51] theophany that God Amen fashioned before
[1:23:55] the foundation of the world knew you
[1:23:57] were going to be here knew where it was
[1:24:00] going to land and you know what he knew
[1:24:01] how you'd act when it got here for you
[1:24:06] you'd either take it and just have faith
[1:24:09] and be
[1:24:10] measurable or you would take it and have
[1:24:13] faith and then have virtue so you can
[1:24:15] give it to other people so you can have
[1:24:17] knowledge of what God said because you
[1:24:19] know what Genesis 126 man doesn't need
[1:24:21] knowledge
[1:24:22] it is
[1:24:24] knowledge it is the knowledge of God how
[1:24:27] can it be learning it's not learning it
[1:24:30] it the Genesis 126 man is not a learning
[1:24:32] is not a learning
[1:24:33] person
[1:24:36] hello Genesis 126 man's got
[1:24:39] virtue it's got
[1:24:41] knowledge but we bind it by our Creeds
[1:24:45] and dogmas right that's very important
[1:24:47] cuz you know what when I used to read
[1:24:49] that quote I thought well that was
[1:24:51] denominations did did that brother Mark
[1:24:53] that no no no no that's right here
[1:24:59] that's our own Creeds and denominational
[1:25:02] ideas brother Dale's been preaching it
[1:25:04] for years it's not out there it's not
[1:25:06] the denominations out there so when we
[1:25:08] set up here right our own thoughts and
[1:25:10] our own ideas on the word of God let's
[1:25:12] sing us 211 red book 21 fountain filled
