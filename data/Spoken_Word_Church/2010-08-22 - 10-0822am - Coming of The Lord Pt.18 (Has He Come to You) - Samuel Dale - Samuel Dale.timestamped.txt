[39:55] Corinthians five we'll begin verse
[40:03] 17 therefore If any man be in Christ he
[40:06] is a new creature a new creation because
[40:08] he's born again see old things are
[40:10] passed away behold all things are become
[40:12] new and all things are of God who hath
[40:15] reconciled us to himself by Jesus
[40:18] Christ and hath given to us the ministry
[40:22] of
[40:23] reconciliation right to it to
[40:28] understand all right now he's given us
[40:30] the ministry of
[40:32] reconciliation to be able to understand
[40:34] right are you reading it to understand
[40:37] to Wi to wh means to understand that God
[40:40] was in Christ reconciling the world and
[40:42] to himself not imputing their trespasses
[40:44] unto them and ha committed unto us the
[40:47] word of
[40:48] reconciliation now then what because of
[40:51] all this is presented all
[40:54] right now then
[40:57] we are ambassadors for Christ as though
[41:00] God did beseech You by us we pray you in
[41:03] Christ stead be you reconciled to God
[41:07] you may be seated the Lord at his
[41:09] Blessing to the reading of the word
[41:13] now I wish you would
[41:15] uh think on some things and this
[41:19] afternoon we'll pick up a topic or so on
[41:21] something that um I've been thinking on
[41:24] and uh but try to bring this to a close
[41:29] but I I wish you would try to understand
[41:33] one point uh
[41:36] today and that is like what we were
[41:38] reading there
[41:40] the when it says in that verse 20 now
[41:45] then we are ambassadors right all right
[41:49] now uh I know everborn again believer I
[41:52] know how that's taught and what it is
[41:54] and and everything and I'm no ever born
[41:57] again believer you can talk about them
[41:58] being an ambassador for Christ you know
[42:01] because that's true but really an
[42:04] ambassador for Christ that Paul is
[42:06] speaking of that's why it says now
[42:10] then in other words a certain position
[42:13] has been reached you don't send a uh a
[42:18] novice ambassador to a foreign field I
[42:22] remember years ago even when we were in
[42:24] school that one of our ambassadors and
[42:27] that's a long time
[42:28] ago uh what other time I was in school
[42:32] uh the ambassad we sent an ambassador to
[42:35] Russia which would have been back in the
[42:37] 50s and he virtually gave Russia all of
[42:40] our wheat well they had to honor that
[42:43] see whatever that Ambassador uh says he
[42:47] has to be you know you got to honor that
[42:50] see but it's what I'm saying now God
[42:53] don't send uh a a he he didn't use a
[42:57] baby to write the word right he used a
[43:00] real Ambassador now the the baby the
[43:03] child in Christ is an ambassador yeah
[43:07] sure sure that's fine because he's
[43:10] representing God right but he's really
[43:12] not a a true Ambassador until like you
[43:14] see that it coming down to understand
[43:17] that God was in Christ reconciling the
[43:20] world unto himself see and then it says
[43:24] now then we see I like those
[43:26] uh statements because that's what rings
[43:29] in my brain and I know how crazy you
[43:32] think mine runs all the time anyway but
[43:34] that's all right but see that I look at
[43:38] things like that he says now
[43:40] then after we know about the
[43:44] understanding that God was in Christ how
[43:46] that we come down to to the point of
[43:49] understanding that we have the word of
[43:51] reconciliation the end time message all
[43:53] right says now then we are are
[43:56] ambassadors for Christ in other words
[43:59] you come down to really be a true
[44:01] Ambassador when you come down to the end
[44:04] time and this end time uh you know place
[44:07] at where we are now in in doing that I
[44:11] want you to think about what I've been
[44:14] trying to say and I know this will be a
[44:16] repeat of some that I've tried to do but
[44:19] I I want to make sure you understand
[44:21] that's you know uh it it I can't reveal
[44:25] it to you right but I I want you to
[44:28] understand what I'm talking about you
[44:31] know that's the that's the one thing
[44:33] that I I try to do I know I try to get
[44:36] into detail and and you know and and
[44:40] working on things and I'll get on a
[44:42] subject and I'll just spend service
[44:44] after service after service after
[44:46] service you know repetitive things and
[44:49] all like that uh I know and I'm sorry
[44:52] that's just my makeup because see I know
[44:55] and realize that the human person uh you
[44:58] hear what is they say you retain about
[45:01] 5% of what you hear so in other words
[45:04] we'll be here a little over an hour and
[45:06] you going to get
[45:08] 5% now if you're
[45:11] asleep it's going to cut down the
[45:13] percentage all right so you know that's
[45:17] the the point of doing and and I
[45:19] understand all things you know like that
[45:21] but now what I want to do is just to to
[45:25] just review a little bit and then if you
[45:27] have any questions raise your hand and
[45:29] and we'll try to to comment on it or
[45:31] anything you want to to be brought up
[45:34] I'll try to uh to cover
[45:36] it but you see now don't think that I
[45:40] have covered on this series I've made it
[45:42] plain over and over and over and over
[45:45] that I'm not talking about that just say
[45:49] the new birth is the coming of the Lord
[45:52] right you know I'm not trying to make
[45:54] that point just just like what I'm
[45:56] trying to make the point
[45:58] here it it is a great position to reach
[46:02] of
[46:03] reconciliation and great understandings
[46:06] then Paul says now then we are
[46:10] ambassadors he didn't say we as
[46:12] ambassadors when we first started you
[46:14] know we're ambassadors because why now
[46:17] we can be trusted to be sent somewhere
[46:20] you know and represent the message of
[46:22] the hour see and and and not as just a
[46:26] baby form all right see then to just say
[46:29] you know well the second coming brother
[46:31] Dell I've heard you over and over say
[46:32] the second coming of Jesus Christ is is
[46:34] the bride coming of Jesus Christ coming
[46:37] out of the church well that just means I
[46:39] got my coat and hat and I walked out and
[46:41] I put it in another church now that's
[46:43] not what I'm talking about I don't
[46:45] believe that's what brother Ram was
[46:47] talking about that's right all right
[46:49] he's the one that said it I gave it to
[46:50] you over and over like a 308 seal book I
[46:54] believe that's right but I gave it to
[46:56] you many times to where that he says the
[46:58] second coming of Jesus Christ is the
[47:00] rapture right all right now he said
[47:04] because we meet him in the air he's
[47:07] explaining it and that's what I've tried
[47:09] to do to you to do but see the end time
[47:12] has a wonderful position to be standing
[47:15] in in the coming of
[47:18] Christ all right cuz this is the end
[47:21] time to where truly God has ambassadors
[47:24] that he can send
[47:26] mhm amen by the end time
[47:29] message the five-fold ministry you know
[47:33] carrying the message and trying to lead
[47:34] the people on can come out to a position
[47:37] of of really being a representation of
[47:40] Jesus Christ you know a representation
[47:42] of Christ is one that that uh knows
[47:45] about Christ right um you know God
[47:48] didn't you know who was it Abraham he
[47:51] didn't send a guy you know he said hey
[47:54] come here come here you just now come
[47:56] into our family but we need somebody to
[47:58] go down and find a wife or my son and
[48:01] you go down
[48:02] there well I don't even know what your
[48:04] son looks
[48:06] like I don't even know who he is no he
[48:10] chose a man that
[48:11] understood and when he got through
[48:13] explaining to you know
[48:17] there to the sister she was able to say
[48:22] that's him standing there in the field y
[48:26] because she' Hur so much about him amen
[48:28] and see that's the way I'm talking about
[48:30] it in the end time that uh see it's in
[48:35] the end time we're promised that the the
[48:38] Bride of Jesus Christ is to come up
[48:39] through the statue of a perfect man come
[48:41] out to the position of adoption come out
[48:44] to the placing of Sons and Daughters of
[48:47] God and and being God made manifest on
[48:50] Earth again as the son of man
[48:54] right you know the word made flesh again
[48:59] in a group of people well that's a great
[49:01] position so don't think it's just that
[49:03] I've been saying well the coming of the
[49:05] Lord is just a the new birth cuz I
[49:07] didn't say that now I kept telling it
[49:09] over and over and over that that wasn't
[49:11] what I was saying I said the second
[49:14] coming of Jesus Christ starts in your
[49:15] new birth amen all and then when your
[49:18] new birth is a finished product and you
[49:21] leave this earth in a Rapture right then
[49:24] you can say I'm Bor again see you know
[49:28] that's why Blood of Adam can't be
[49:29] understood by the natural mind because
[49:32] one time he'll be preaching something it
[49:33] looks like he's going that way and then
[49:35] in a little bit it looks like he's going
[49:37] that way all of the same thing you know
[49:40] because he's preaching the
[49:43] word but see then the second coming of
[49:46] Jesus Christ is what it started on the
[49:48] day of
[49:50] Pentecost in the hearts of the Saints
[49:53] just as we covered how the that in the
[49:56] Old
[49:57] Testament that the coming of Jesus
[49:59] Christ the first time took 4,000 years
[50:03] and all of those prophets bringing that
[50:07] and they were actually bringing the word
[50:08] of the hour that they were there and you
[50:11] know what you remember how we were
[50:13] trying to bring it out blessed is he
[50:14] that cometh in the name of the
[50:17] Lord see they were actually to the
[50:20] people those prophets were God to the
[50:23] people they were not the god of Glory no
[50:27] but they were God to the people in the
[50:29] bases that God had entrusted them to
[50:33] bring the word that was God's
[50:37] presence was through those prophets
[50:39] right and they would write the word and
[50:42] then Jesus would step out there being
[50:44] the very one that would be the the the
[50:47] very word
[50:49] himself and see that was his first
[50:52] coming well why can't we see then that
[50:55] here in the end time see look back down
[50:59] through and see what's T has taken place
[51:02] and see that down through the church
[51:04] ages has been the coming of the Lord
[51:08] right but there's a lot in this in time
[51:11] to be dealing with the coming of the
[51:14] Lord we've got to walk off this Earth in
[51:17] the Rapture to talk about the second
[51:19] coming of Jesus Christ and I want to
[51:21] make sure you didn't misunderstand me on
[51:23] that to just think well you know oh it's
[51:25] just a simple matter no it's not a
[51:27] simple matter right you and I are here
[51:30] we've got to become the word amen amen
[51:33] made flesh for the portion that we are
[51:37] now we're not all the bride that's see
[51:40] it's around the
[51:41] world but see everybody then that's got
[51:44] their part has to have their part right
[51:47] that's why it's took so long see 40
[51:49] something years for God to be able to
[51:52] get the message around and and to the
[51:54] people you you know to where that they
[51:56] could see
[51:57] it and see then in that then it's been
[52:00] what been the the coming of the Lord see
[52:03] when God sends you like when that's the
[52:05] reason we read the Ambassador he said
[52:07] then we are now we are ambassadors now
[52:12] see all right he sent you to replace him
[52:17] right now the Catholic Church believes
[52:20] that you're instead of God
[52:24] right that's what they believe the pope
[52:26] is but now that's not how we believe it
[52:28] that's right we believe that we're in
[52:31] God's stad cuz that's what scripture I
[52:33] got in here in a while I read it said
[52:35] you know I beseech you in God's stead
[52:38] not instead of God because being instead
[52:41] of God would mean that you was greater
[52:44] than he but if you're in God's stead if
[52:47] you're an ambassador then God is in you
[52:51] cuz see those prophets as they would go
[52:53] out and preach their message message
[52:56] like the psalmist like I said they'd say
[52:58] you know they pierc my hands and my feet
[52:59] it just like he was actually going
[53:01] through a great
[53:03] turmoil in his life and you know if
[53:06] you'd have been standing there looking
[53:07] at him you'd have probably seen tears in
[53:09] his eyes and and the body wretching like
[53:11] with pain and he would be screaming out
[53:13] you know they pierced my hands and my
[53:16] feet cuz it was so real cuz that was the
[53:20] Lord using that
[53:23] person and see blessed is he that cometh
[53:25] in the name of the Lord then right you
[53:27] remember how he was explaining it I send
[53:29] brother Danny in my place that's
[53:32] fine as long as the people knows that I
[53:36] send him I give him the authority I make
[53:39] him an ambassador that he can go
[53:41] represent me well that's the same as me
[53:43] being there that's right but see that is
[53:46] even carnal because that is even not the
[53:49] way God is but God is God is really
[53:52] there amen he was there in them prophets
[53:55] amen amen all right he was D down to the
[53:58] church
[53:59] ages the seven spirits of God you know
[54:01] the eyes running to and fro in all the
[54:03] Book of Revelation right you know you
[54:05] think maybe that I took a lot of time
[54:06] trying to explain that lot about it but
[54:09] my Lord we've been 6 months on the
[54:11] golden candlesticks and things if we
[54:13] just stopped broke it down you know the
[54:16] way the Bible covers it and the things
[54:18] but see I was wanting you to see that
[54:21] that was
[54:23] God the bride right coming out of the
[54:26] church right that's what's been
[54:28] happening down through the the ages
[54:31] right the bride has been coming out of
[54:33] the
[54:34] church see the prophet said it's a
[54:36] church out of a church cuz a church
[54:38] means a called out you
[54:41] know but now do you understand what I'm
[54:43] saying then see that is not to just make
[54:45] a statement well the second coming well
[54:47] that's Second Coming is a new birth oh
[54:49] we understand that you know no that's
[54:51] not what I
[54:53] said that was not not what I was
[54:56] teaching but the second coming to you
[54:59] begin in the New Birth that you receive
[55:02] amen are you expecting something else to
[55:05] be his second coming what is it going to
[55:07] be right I'm serious I want to know see
[55:11] what you mean cuz I I mean I'm involved
[55:13] in this thing you I I want to know if
[55:16] you have some other way of us getting
[55:18] out of here other than than just
[55:20] grinding in the word and God revealing
[55:24] his word to us and as he's revealing his
[55:27] word then to me that's the person of God
[55:31] being revealed to you
[55:34] amen that's why you're a new creature
[55:37] right you're a new creation right but
[55:40] that doesn't that doesn't solve
[55:42] everything that's just a new birth when
[55:44] you started
[55:46] right but see then coming up through the
[55:48] statue of perect man on out through
[55:49] those things I believe that's what Paul
[55:52] was trying to tell the Corinthians now
[55:55] we are
[55:56] ambassadors you've been in the journey a
[55:58] long time now you're you're an
[56:00] ambassador see
[56:03] amen see when those prophets wrote the
[56:09] Bible that was a same as God writing it
[56:15] amen they didn't have their own thoughts
[56:17] that's right like brother R explaining
[56:20] you know that that we're there that
[56:22] Isaiah would a set of Virgin shall
[56:24] conceive said probably went home and
[56:25] said my Lord what kind of a goof up did
[56:27] I make yeah how's a virgin going to
[56:33] conceive you know read something the
[56:35] other day about this and I'm not saying
[56:37] anything wrong now I'm just saying they
[56:38] they're studying this uh artificial
[56:40] insemination every how you use those big
[56:42] old words I don't understand it but
[56:44] where they putting that together and
[56:45] coming out with these things and babies
[56:47] and all and thank God for
[56:49] them but they're also so seeing now that
[56:52] they're turning out to be bigger babies
[56:56] if you've been reading that they say
[56:57] there there actually would be bigger
[56:59] babies from most of those things cuz
[57:02] it's not natural right it's not the
[57:04] natural way right of it being done see
[57:08] but now I'm not against that I'm saying
[57:10] thank God for it cuz there's a lot of B
[57:13] you know a lot of people have little
[57:14] babies but I'm just saying that's it's
[57:18] not the way that was intended to
[57:20] be and see then it it it brings other
[57:24] things all right but now listen the
[57:27] prophets as I said they didn't use their
[57:29] own thoughts their words were not their
[57:32] words that's right that's right it was
[57:36] God using their lips right right right
[57:41] now but what about in the New Testament
[57:43] Prophet you remember said you've been
[57:45] given more gifts than all of them
[57:47] remember that's what it said about
[57:48] brother R right cuz see he was a new
[57:50] testament prophet he was a born again
[57:52] believer the Old Testament Prophet was
[57:54] come out and speak his word and then he
[57:56] would go back see he was
[58:00] Moses you know but then he was God and
[58:02] he was Moses right but now brother
[58:05] brandom not meaning that everything
[58:06] brother Bram done no not we're not
[58:08] foolish but see the Holy Ghost was
[58:11] inside of him in the new birth right
[58:14] then surely we can see that Moses was
[58:17] God unto the people yes and if anybody
[58:20] thinks like I don't keep up with a lot
[58:23] of things and check it out but if you'll
[58:25] check in Exodus 4:16 it says that that
[58:28] Moses was instead of God right you'll be
[58:32] instead but I'll challenge you on
[58:34] something
[58:36] else every other definition of instead
[58:38] in the Bible has a strong Concord
[58:41] definition that does not have one
[58:44] because they didn't know what to put
[58:46] there they just put the word instead
[58:49] understand that understand they didn't
[58:50] understand what was being said I'm just
[58:53] giving you that as a thought CU see I
[58:55] try to check everything out uh but now
[58:57] watch good God wanted the people to
[59:04] understand that he was with them that's
[59:06] what I've been trying to get us to see
[59:08] see not looking for him to come from
[59:12] somewhere but to look at him being here
[59:16] right
[59:18] see Moses said he's not over the sea
[59:21] he's not up in heaven Paul picks it up
[59:25] he's not
[59:27] thee right he's in You by the new birth
[59:31] now he was very n to them but now he's
[59:34] in Us by the new bird see but God wanted
[59:37] the people to see look at Abraham
[59:39] meeting
[59:42] MDC and actually feeding a
[59:45] meal to God
[59:49] himself the very God of Glory was
[59:51] standing there upon earth right
[59:57] see it's never been that God wants us to
[1:00:00] see there's a God somewhere else he
[1:00:02] wants us to understand that God is with
[1:00:04] us that's right that has been the whole
[1:00:06] thing that's what I've tried my best for
[1:00:08] 40 years now to preach that God's not up
[1:00:11] in heaven right a God in heaven forgive
[1:00:16] me Lord is no good to
[1:00:18] us amen I kind of like what brother said
[1:00:22] about it and I like it my way of saying
[1:00:24] a god Heaven Ain't no good god with me
[1:00:26] or in me is good now remember the man
[1:00:29] that that said you know uh I I want to
[1:00:33] god with skin on it you remember the
[1:00:35] little kid or something we see I want to
[1:00:38] know and realize God is in these skins
[1:00:41] that's what I'm trying to preach unto us
[1:00:43] all right but see mdic actually came
[1:00:46] down God himself came down and sat down
[1:00:52] there and ate a c
[1:00:55] you see God wanted the children of
[1:00:58] Israel to see it right Moses tried his
[1:01:02] best to get the people to to see the God
[1:01:05] that he that he had met that's what he
[1:01:07] wanted to do he wanted them to meet at
[1:01:09] the burning bush he gave them all the
[1:01:12] bush he wanted them to see it but what
[1:01:14] did they do no no we don't want to do
[1:01:17] that we said now what we want to do
[1:01:18] Moses we want you to go up there and you
[1:01:20] get What God Says and you come back down
[1:01:22] and you tell us and we'll believe you
[1:01:25] right now there was God killed them
[1:01:27] right there cuz they stand there lying
[1:01:28] through their teeth that's
[1:01:31] right
[1:01:32] right they were dying through their
[1:01:34] teeth cuz they didn't believe
[1:01:36] it go over and read I just looking at
[1:01:38] one the other day while I studying on
[1:01:40] some of this go over to numbers 16
[1:01:42] sometimes and read that whole chapter
[1:01:44] that's where you'll find uh Dayan and
[1:01:46] Kora and
[1:01:48] abam you know and what happened to them
[1:01:51] because Dayan and them said you know
[1:01:53] Moses you you take too much upon
[1:01:55] yourself right we're spiritual too now
[1:01:58] they were the people that had said in
[1:02:00] chapters previous to that you go get
[1:02:03] What God Says and we will believe you
[1:02:05] right now where did they lose that at
[1:02:08] right they got where that they were so
[1:02:11] spiritual until they got to where that
[1:02:14] they believed see if you'll notice in
[1:02:16] there Moses said are you trying to even
[1:02:18] now to take the
[1:02:20] priesthood see they were in a priest
[1:02:23] line
[1:02:25] but they were not the priesthood right
[1:02:27] to be able to where they could go behind
[1:02:29] a veil in a different thing but see
[1:02:31] that's what they
[1:02:34] wanted and they actually
[1:02:37] said
[1:02:39] Moses you're too you think you got too
[1:02:42] much we're spiritual too that's right
[1:02:45] the whole congregation is
[1:02:49] spiritual he said I'll tell you what you
[1:02:52] do he said we'll just find out what's
[1:02:55] going
[1:02:56] on he said you get all of them together
[1:02:59] tomorrow and
[1:03:00] said it was 250
[1:03:03] priest their ministers there did you get
[1:03:06] them together and said we'll just find
[1:03:10] out soam and Kora
[1:03:14] and you know daan they there and what
[1:03:17] was so odd to me has always been to me
[1:03:20] so sad when they stood out there their
[1:03:22] wives stood with them
[1:03:25] and their children right stood with
[1:03:31] them and what
[1:03:33] happened Moses said if what I'm telling
[1:03:36] you is the truth we're going to see
[1:03:39] something that's not even never been
[1:03:40] done before said if it if they're wrong
[1:03:43] said the Earth will open and swallow
[1:03:44] them
[1:03:47] up cuz they wouldn't even come up read
[1:03:49] it two times in there in numbers they
[1:03:52] wouldn't even come up when Moses called
[1:03:54] them you know why cuz they were scared
[1:03:56] of him that's
[1:03:58] right right they were
[1:04:01] scared they were scared cuz they said
[1:04:03] you brought us out here to kill us and
[1:04:05] if you'll notice they said we left a
[1:04:07] land of milk and honey another word
[1:04:10] Egypt with the garlics and the cucumbers
[1:04:12] and they called it the land of milk and
[1:04:14] honey and said you said you've taken us
[1:04:16] to a land of milk and honey read numbers
[1:04:18] is in
[1:04:19] there but see they wouldn't come up
[1:04:23] Moses fin told come on
[1:04:24] mhm see they were afraid that Moses was
[1:04:27] going to physically kill them that's
[1:04:29] right right you know they figured he had
[1:04:31] enough back up that he could be able to
[1:04:33] get them all together he's going to kill
[1:04:34] them they didn't want to come up there
[1:04:35] they was pretty
[1:04:38] smart but see he finally said come on
[1:04:41] home that's right but God opened up the
[1:04:43] Earth amen and swallowed them up
[1:04:48] 250 preachers standing with the sensors
[1:04:51] in their hand or what they call those
[1:04:52] things and Fire right off the altar of
[1:04:55] the same place that Aaron had his that's
[1:04:59] right ER swallowed him up you know what
[1:05:02] was so great about God he said gather up
[1:05:04] All Those sensors cuz they're holy and
[1:05:07] he says we'll make other things out of
[1:05:09] them but you understand what I'm getting
[1:05:11] at they said we will believe you Moses
[1:05:16] we don't want God to speak but they
[1:05:19] didn't believe Moses see because they
[1:05:21] didn't have a personal experience with
[1:05:24] the god that Moses had an experience
[1:05:27] with right they had an opportunity to
[1:05:30] but they they didn't have an
[1:05:32] experience do we have an experience amen
[1:05:35] see I'm asking you a
[1:05:39] question this is the coming of the Lord
[1:05:41] part 18 this is the question has he come
[1:05:45] to you come
[1:05:47] on through the opening of the word has
[1:05:50] God come to you I believe that yes sir
[1:05:54] Israel would believe that God was in
[1:05:58] Moses and with his mouth cuz they could
[1:06:00] see that but then when it would come
[1:06:02] down to the final
[1:06:04] line oh no no no we we really don't know
[1:06:07] go we're all spiritual daythan and cor
[1:06:09] and and baron was pretty good preachers
[1:06:11] they convinced the people that they were
[1:06:12] spiritual too and they were spiritual
[1:06:15] that's what Moses wanted them to be
[1:06:19] right what listen which one said I would
[1:06:21] that all were prophets was Moses that
[1:06:24] said that we did all the children of
[1:06:27] were prophets cuz he wanted them to do
[1:06:29] it but now show you how far off the
[1:06:32] human being can be what about the Earth
[1:06:35] opening up what about the proving of who
[1:06:38] was who how about all of the things of
[1:06:40] Moses standing there 250 preachers and
[1:06:43] all of abam and Kora and their families
[1:06:46] and everything goes down in a hole you
[1:06:49] know what happened the next
[1:06:52] day read it verse 4 41 of the 16th
[1:06:56] chapter of
[1:06:57] numbers they come before Moses and they
[1:07:00] said Moses you've killed the people of
[1:07:06] God God came down and smote him with a
[1:07:09] plague what did he say I forgot I think
[1:07:12] 16,000 or something somewhere up into
[1:07:14] the thousands of them died in the plague
[1:07:18] well you know what happened to show you
[1:07:20] Moses was still right where he was he
[1:07:22] said Aaron grab your s and run among the
[1:07:26] people pre Adventure we can make an
[1:07:28] atonement still trying to save the
[1:07:31] people and them doing everything they
[1:07:32] doing and accusing him of all of that
[1:07:34] but 16,000 or something like that so
[1:07:36] many thousand of them died why cuz
[1:07:39] they'd never seen the god Moses saw
[1:07:41] right that's what I'm asking
[1:07:43] you through the opening of the word that
[1:07:46] the end time Prophet has brought unto
[1:07:52] us can you see that God is here right
[1:07:57] can you see that God is real
[1:07:59] right amen that he's not just a thought
[1:08:02] or ative of your imagination now come on
[1:08:04] be human beings and think sensible when
[1:08:07] you first heard of this message you
[1:08:08] didn't know God was real that's right oh
[1:08:12] yes God is real I talked to him this
[1:08:14] morning
[1:08:17] yeah
[1:08:20] yeah but did you know how real God was
[1:08:23] when you first heard of
[1:08:24] it no that's right I believe we're just
[1:08:28] now beginning to realize the reality of
[1:08:30] God that's right amen and it's true the
[1:08:32] opening of the word that's it right
[1:08:35] there it can't be anything else it's
[1:08:38] true the opening of the
[1:08:43] word but see you
[1:08:45] say some of you have said this way you
[1:08:48] say brother Dale has the word of the
[1:08:52] Lord
[1:08:56] but why then do you side with the Enemy
[1:09:00] sometime
[1:09:02] amen what do you mean because you side
[1:09:05] with the
[1:09:06] Enemy wouldn't that what Samson said
[1:09:09] about the guys there you know
[1:09:12] that if you hadn't have been plowed with
[1:09:15] my wife you wouldn't have found out
[1:09:16] these
[1:09:17] things you remember in the Samson and
[1:09:19] how that they learned the secrets right
[1:09:22] and then he had to go out and kill a
[1:09:23] bunch of people to bring back a a prize
[1:09:25] for that he said you've been playing
[1:09:28] with my heers reason you
[1:09:35] know if we believe that God is here by
[1:09:38] the revealed word that does not make
[1:09:40] anything out of the person right
[1:09:45] right right right brother random was
[1:09:50] what the prophet of God right
[1:09:55] wonderful but he was not God right you
[1:09:59] can say well he's God unto me I know
[1:10:00] what you're talking about yeah that's
[1:10:02] all right I just I say it too because he
[1:10:03] was he brought the word to us right all
[1:10:07] right but he wasn't God
[1:10:10] right God was using the man right we're
[1:10:13] not giving the glory to the man we're
[1:10:15] giving the glory to God we see if God
[1:10:18] has given us a word Lula thank God for
[1:10:21] giving us the word thank God for that
[1:10:23] that's all that I've ever
[1:10:26] said right all right cuz see we're
[1:10:30] talking about blessed is he that cometh
[1:10:32] in the name of the Lord
[1:10:34] right if God has sent us with the word
[1:10:38] then why don't we believe that God has
[1:10:40] come in us with the
[1:10:42] word I said to us now I'm not talking
[1:10:44] about me I'm not trying to build up
[1:10:45] anything I'm trying to I've always tried
[1:10:48] to get you to see that there's a God in
[1:10:50] you
[1:10:52] amen what God deal with me I don't tell
[1:10:54] you a lot because you'll get buil upon
[1:10:57] that to where that you'll think well now
[1:10:59] you know brother D brother brother it
[1:11:02] ain't brother Dale it's God
[1:11:07] Amen thank God for who the word comes
[1:11:11] to yeah thank
[1:11:15] God but that that won't take us out of
[1:11:18] this world for you to believe that
[1:11:20] there's a god in me right you got to
[1:11:22] have God in you
[1:11:25] that's what I tried to encourage you to
[1:11:26] do
[1:11:28] see surely we can see that when Jesus
[1:11:31] Christ came into the
[1:11:34] world sure he was a prophet he was
[1:11:37] fulfilling the office of a prophet but
[1:11:39] he was more than that wouldn't he he was
[1:11:41] God made manifest well why can't we
[1:11:43] believe that in the end time by the new
[1:11:47] birth right the scripture says he made
[1:11:50] us a new creature creation why can't we
[1:11:54] believe then that the coming of the Lord
[1:11:56] is a revealing of the word to you and I
[1:11:59] right what would be the trouble of
[1:12:01] believ in that there's plenty things to
[1:12:04] take place in the revealing of the word
[1:12:08] right sure there's a lot of things that
[1:12:11] hasn't transpired like I said the other
[1:12:12] day where we're not under a religious
[1:12:15] persecution and I've always SE the
[1:12:18] prophet the way he said it right that
[1:12:22] they going to come after us for we
[1:12:23] believe right but nobody's come after
[1:12:27] us there's a lot of things left come on
[1:12:31] but it can take place in a hurry
[1:12:37] amen see the new birth making you a new
[1:12:41] creation right that's what I've been
[1:12:44] trying to
[1:12:46] preach then that would be the coming of
[1:12:48] the Lord to you right
[1:12:52] amen
[1:12:55] because he's not coming as a uh group or
[1:13:00] you know I know I know it's the body but
[1:13:03] still a body has many different kind of
[1:13:05] Parts but in the Gentiles it's not
[1:13:08] coming like he did to Israel to where
[1:13:10] did he come down and and literally stood
[1:13:12] there and said unless you believe that I
[1:13:14] am he you die in your
[1:13:16] sins This Not That way to the
[1:13:19] Gentiles the coming of the Lord is the
[1:13:21] revealing of the word amen
[1:13:26] all right that's why some of us will
[1:13:28] have to die and go by the grave why
[1:13:30] because the the word has not been
[1:13:32] revealed to us
[1:13:37] right but you see it least if we've got
[1:13:40] the word planted in the field come on
[1:13:43] Amen then God can Quicken that word
[1:13:46] that's all I've ever tried to do for you
[1:13:48] you know for you and I both cuz you see
[1:13:50] I want it too you know but now
[1:13:55] listen see we're not like the Old
[1:13:57] Testament in the bases that we have the
[1:14:00] new
[1:14:01] birth amen we have actually the presence
[1:14:05] of God living within us by the new birth
[1:14:08] whereas the old test people only had
[1:14:11] him with them right and an anointing
[1:14:15] that could come up on them that's right
[1:14:17] cuz they didn't have the new birth back
[1:14:18] there that's
[1:14:20] right see but down through the church
[1:14:24] ages it's been God revealing himself
[1:14:29] through a group of people right the
[1:14:31] Believers what did Christ Ministry God
[1:14:33] reveal the Believers in the book come on
[1:14:36] amen that's it you realize that
[1:14:42] that there's not much
[1:14:45] written now listen to me a minute
[1:14:48] there's not much written about the
[1:14:50] church oh yeah you said no no no there's
[1:14:54] not much written about the church
[1:14:57] right I'm talking about down to the
[1:15:01] ages no
[1:15:03] right it started out in the book of Acts
[1:15:06] that was written Paul Peter James John
[1:15:10] all of them writing yes but then all at
[1:15:12] once you've got a vast
[1:15:14] gap between there and the coming of
[1:15:18] Elijah in the end time
[1:15:21] right that's what you're ET said he say
[1:15:23] not much said about the church down to
[1:15:25] the why because it would be a mystery
[1:15:28] that would be
[1:15:29] waiting for the end time where the
[1:15:31] Prophet would pick it up and explain the
[1:15:34] seven golden
[1:15:36] candlesticks but you realize that Martin
[1:15:38] Luther would the just shall live by
[1:15:40] faith is just as much Bible as Moses
[1:15:44] saying I'm going to Egypt and take over
[1:15:48] that's that's where we don't see it like
[1:15:51] that that's right we're not going to
[1:15:53] have to raise Martin Luther up and
[1:15:56] preach to him a sermon to bring him to a
[1:16:00] Perfection right he went down in his
[1:16:03] Perfection and will raise one morning
[1:16:06] and the prophet said wake up just like
[1:16:07] just like he'd been asleep you
[1:16:12] know just up there he is boy that was a
[1:16:16] good NA am not realizing at 5 600
[1:16:21] years but are you fing what I'm
[1:16:26] saying
[1:16:27] God came
[1:16:30] down to dwell with
[1:16:33] man and no longer and never will he be
[1:16:37] self-existing again
[1:16:40] right he chose it that way
[1:16:46] right he chose it to be that
[1:16:49] way he chose it to be to work in that he
[1:16:53] could come down and be literally here
[1:16:56] with us right he said well God's up in
[1:17:01] heaven
[1:17:03] today well where do you get that
[1:17:08] at I mean show it to them in the
[1:17:11] Bible well God is millions of millions
[1:17:15] of light years out there up into the
[1:17:17] space you know where do you get that at
[1:17:22] am
[1:17:24] as I said to you what good is a god out
[1:17:26] there right
[1:17:30] right I don't want to get him to get
[1:17:32] hooked up in The Ether ways or what you
[1:17:34] call all those things and him be off on
[1:17:36] a journey and me need him come on you
[1:17:40] know cuz if your heart right now takes a
[1:17:43] big blast and blows out who was it the
[1:17:45] other day that
[1:17:46] was Allan they said he probably never
[1:17:49] even felt it it would just sit your
[1:17:52] great
[1:17:54] well now wouldn't it be something for
[1:17:55] Adam to lay there and it feels pain
[1:17:58] he do The Ether waves come down lord no
[1:18:04] you you said oh brother tell you don't
[1:18:07] understand I agree with you I don't
[1:18:09] understand I don't understand why you
[1:18:11] understand the way you understand
[1:18:14] amen because I've never look for the
[1:18:16] coming of the Lord to be somewhere else
[1:18:19] come on when I saw this message I saw
[1:18:21] what this message is this message is the
[1:18:24] coming of the Lord believe amen that's
[1:18:27] right that's why I cherish the prophet's
[1:18:30] message that's right it is the coming of
[1:18:33] the Lord to me and I'm not going to find
[1:18:35] it in the G
[1:18:37] domac right right
[1:18:40] amen McDonald domc in Jamaica either
[1:18:46] one
[1:18:48] see this is a love letter this is to me
[1:18:52] this is my Bible right right this is my
[1:18:55] God speaking to me right why can't we
[1:18:59] believe that am that's right why are we
[1:19:02] looking for something
[1:19:05] else the prophet never told you about a
[1:19:08] god somewhere else
[1:19:10] that's he talked about God being
[1:19:14] real
[1:19:16] see how would it be that that we could
[1:19:19] ever think about God not being real and
[1:19:21] then the prophet would say things like
[1:19:23] that we've used in the last few messages
[1:19:25] are like one time where he says you know
[1:19:27] the final under her messenger she'll be
[1:19:29] the final voice to the final
[1:19:32] age right thousands of live voices
[1:19:35] preaching the word of God Amen see the
[1:19:37] whole bride of Christ around the world
[1:19:39] taking the message to the lost that's
[1:19:42] right and that's his final
[1:19:45] voice that's his presence right cuz
[1:19:49] wherever the voice and the person is
[1:19:51] that's his presence
[1:19:54] that's
[1:19:57] right but see then the last one we were
[1:20:00] on are the other day see brother random
[1:20:03] on page 76 or you page 76 Christ Myst of
[1:20:06] God reveal he said making it the
[1:20:08] headship of the body that is redeemed to
[1:20:11] bring the message
[1:20:15] oh right you say but brother Randon
[1:20:18] brought the message preach right amen
[1:20:23] but brother R's not the final
[1:20:28] voice to the final Aid that's
[1:20:31] right he brought his message he
[1:20:34] delivered the message thank
[1:20:36] God now you and I are to become that
[1:20:39] message that always tell you about the
[1:20:41] walls of Jericho Joshua was up on the
[1:20:43] hill watching them cuz he done told him
[1:20:46] what to do when they got down there and
[1:20:48] done what he told them to do then they
[1:20:50] stopped and looked at the wall and they
[1:20:51] didn't holler scream
[1:20:53] you
[1:20:54] know what do you think it was some kind
[1:20:57] of a r loud racket that vibrated now the
[1:20:59] ground opened up and swallowed the walls
[1:21:02] they didn't vibrate down you got Common
[1:21:04] Sense you'd think about it that you'd
[1:21:05] have to be 50 ft away from the wall if
[1:21:07] they vibrated and fell
[1:21:09] down or it fall on you that's right
[1:21:13] brother but the Earth just opened up
[1:21:15] what at the word of the people when the
[1:21:17] people became what the man had
[1:21:20] said that's all I've ever tried my best
[1:21:23] to get you and I to see when we become
[1:21:25] what brother random has says we
[1:21:29] are and he only said what God said we
[1:21:33] are
[1:21:37] right what's the difference in the
[1:21:39] person and the voice
[1:21:41] right Book of Revelation he turned to
[1:21:43] see the voice the voice in the person
[1:21:46] brother R said is the
[1:21:49] same but the bride see
[1:21:53] is to bring the voice in the final age
[1:21:55] right what is that
[1:21:58] voice you can't add one thing to brother
[1:22:00] R's message now so don't worry about
[1:22:02] that right that's what they've done and
[1:22:05] that's what they've done with Barum and
[1:22:07] cor and all of them you know they got so
[1:22:09] spiritual and that's way the people of
[1:22:10] the message is done they've got so
[1:22:12] spiritual until when brother bran was
[1:22:14] here like I said about Moses and them it
[1:22:17] wouldn't come up when Moses said come up
[1:22:20] they wouldn't come up you know why they
[1:22:21] scared to death that's right Moses going
[1:22:23] to whoop them all yes and they probably
[1:22:26] would by the time he got up
[1:22:29] there but they were
[1:22:33] scared see the people of this message
[1:22:35] would have scared of brother random when
[1:22:36] he was
[1:22:38] here right boy they wouldn't dare tackle
[1:22:41] him while he's
[1:22:42] here but immediately leaving the scene
[1:22:45] that's right here comes all of these
[1:22:47] great things the prophet told me
[1:22:49] something secret I remember this brother
[1:22:51] he used to preach
[1:22:53] and he had everybody because everybody
[1:22:54] would talking to me about it and he'd
[1:22:56] say brother brandom not only told me to
[1:22:58] preach of course he had a little problem
[1:23:00] in his marital and brother randam did
[1:23:01] tell the people to leave him alone now I
[1:23:04] know that so forget
[1:23:05] it
[1:23:07] but he said God brother R not only told
[1:23:10] me to preach he told me what to preach
[1:23:12] well everybody what did he tell him to
[1:23:15] preach then they got all them doctrines
[1:23:17] going around the country that there was
[1:23:18] seven Thunders with seven preachers and
[1:23:20] they named him as one of the the
[1:23:23] preachers That was supposed to be one of
[1:23:25] the
[1:23:26] Thunders now you know of some of the
[1:23:28] others that said I can't preach era and
[1:23:31] I challenged him right here before he
[1:23:33] come to this church one night on it and
[1:23:35] he did preach era here and talked it
[1:23:37] down at the school building and I told
[1:23:39] him he was wrong not being nasty being
[1:23:42] sarcastic just being truthful but you
[1:23:46] see they wouldn't D face brother Brandon
[1:23:49] while he was here but as quick as he was
[1:23:52] gone they started saying he told me
[1:23:54] these things well you know what I'm just
[1:23:56] kind of a guy you
[1:23:59] know I'm

[1:24:28] something I'll find it out
[1:24:33] right I've got a little gift of being
[1:24:36] stubborn I guess it
[1:24:39] is but I can find out something if I
[1:24:42] want to know something from brother
[1:24:43] Donnie I don't have to walk up to him
[1:24:44] and say Donnie I want to know so and
[1:24:47] so I'll just pick him to death about it
[1:24:49] for a while and get what I want to know

[1:24:54] not the gift ain't
[1:24:55] working see but see this brother he kept
[1:24:59] saying God told the prophet told me to

[1:25:55] I'm just s God didn't ask you what you
[1:25:59] are I'll get to it this evening brother
[1:26:01] R said when I married my
[1:26:05] wife he said she cooks and does things
[1:26:09] something to that degree he said
[1:26:11] because that's her part of the
[1:26:13] obligation of doing he said but I'm
[1:26:15] married to her she never does it
[1:26:20] right your looking around at
[1:26:29] T see I mean in that contract you know
[1:26:32] the marriage vows it doesn't say if you
[1:26:35] quit cooking you can divorce itn't
[1:26:37] doesn't say that but now
[1:26:42] listen the bride is to be the final
[1:26:49] voice right under her me messenger we
[1:26:53] don't have we don't added anything to it
[1:26:55] come and show me where I've added
[1:26:56] anything to this message that's that's
[1:26:58] right I challenge you on internet or
[1:27:00] anywhere or anybody that's ever been
[1:27:02] around me come show me where I've ever
[1:27:03] added anything or took away from what
[1:27:05] the prophet of God has
[1:27:07] said well I'm open for it where you
[1:27:12] at of course you'll go tell everybody
[1:27:14] else I
[1:27:16] did but remember that will be answered
[1:27:19] to one of these days because that's your
[1:27:21] business you go tell everybody else
[1:27:23] where the problem is but won't tell
[1:27:26] me
[1:27:28] no but
[1:27:30] listen what then do we talk about that
[1:27:34] would be the message that would cover
[1:27:36] the entire
[1:27:38] Bible that the bride would be bringing
[1:27:41] the message in the end time that's
[1:27:44] right we preached for 2,000 years on he
[1:27:48] has
[1:27:51] risen
[1:27:53] but don't you think about it's about
[1:27:54] time to say he's
[1:27:57] hereen yeah I mean is any problem with
[1:28:00] that is that a great Supernatural
[1:28:02] Brother D I thought this you was going
[1:28:03] to tell us they you going to preach this
[1:28:05] you no no we're going to preach what he
[1:28:07] is here right that's all I've ever tried
[1:28:10] to tell you about the second coming of
[1:28:11] Jesus Christ now if those around the
[1:28:14] world or people out there can't see that
[1:28:16] he is here then where are they
[1:28:19] at right with the bride
[1:28:23] she knows right where he's at
[1:28:25] amen cuz she knows that scripture is
[1:28:27] talking about her right like I've always
[1:28:30] told you go to the Book of Revelation
[1:28:31] and show me Jesus every byself come on
[1:28:34] folks that's why the devil don't want
[1:28:36] you in the Book of
[1:28:38] Revelations show me Jesus in The Book of
[1:28:40] Revelation by itself like I said the
[1:28:42] other day you said well that well that
[1:28:44] that lamb that took the book you better
[1:28:46] go back and read your prophet's message
[1:28:48] cuz where did that lamb come from he
[1:28:49] said it come from the church ages that's
[1:28:52] right cuz it's got seven horns and seven
[1:28:55] eyes it come from the church ages what
[1:28:58] produces the lamb to take the book what
[1:29:01] made it to where brother random could
[1:29:02] come forth and preach the word right the
[1:29:06] promise of
[1:29:08] God that would show us I've told you
[1:29:10] what I believe I believe the coming of
[1:29:13] the Lord is revealing of his word right
[1:29:16] I believe that those seals that the
[1:29:17] prophet was to preach that nobody didn't
[1:29:19] get to preach down there Jesus preached
[1:29:21] them in Matthew
[1:29:22] uh 24 come on he preached and learn the
[1:29:25] word right but brother around can't add
[1:29:27] to
[1:29:27] it but you say well now there wouldn't
[1:29:29] no seventh one in there there's only six
[1:29:32] no because there Jesus was why did he
[1:29:33] have to preach anything else he was
[1:29:34] standing
[1:29:36] there when he says I am the I am surely
[1:29:39] that's enough fulfillment of what it
[1:29:40] said back there before Abraham was I am
[1:29:43] is that enough of the I am to know that
[1:29:44] the I am that's standing in front of the
[1:29:46] Burning Bush was the you know the was
[1:29:48] the same
[1:29:49] one was listening last night of a
[1:29:51] message mage of Grace were the prophet
[1:29:52] I'd invite you to listen to that message
[1:29:54] in 61 I it's 8:27 61 the message of
[1:29:59] Grace and he was talking about those
[1:30:01] rainbows coming down three of them
[1:30:03] coming down you remember and said the
[1:30:06] Jesus of the New Testament is a Jehovah
[1:30:08] the
[1:30:10] old he said only change his mask right y
[1:30:14] he said just change his mask and come in
[1:30:16] flesh well now where is that Pillar of
[1:30:18] Fire
[1:30:20] today still Fallen the bride of
[1:30:27] Christ it's been seen right here two or
[1:30:29] three times and people won't even say
[1:30:31] nothing about
[1:30:33] it cuz you see you don't see it if you
[1:30:35] don't see it you ain't going to say
[1:30:36] nobody see
[1:30:37] it but that's all right see that's where
[1:30:40] I preach I don't have to have it God
[1:30:42] knows that I don't have to have that
[1:30:43] backup to prove I'm proving what I say
[1:30:46] by this word you come and argue on this
[1:30:49] word we'll be glad to say sit down here
[1:30:52] and talk on this
[1:30:54] word not argue with you talk on the word
[1:30:58] because that's what I believe so I
[1:31:01] believe the headstone to the church is a
[1:31:02] revealing of those Seven
[1:31:04] Seals to the bride of Christ that's
[1:31:06] right which is a revealing of his word y
[1:31:10] then what would be the
[1:31:12] message after the head and body unites
[1:31:16] that the bride will bring that he's here
[1:31:19] y do you see that he's here how simple
[1:31:22] is it I'm accused of being so
[1:31:25] intellectual that's what people said
[1:31:27] brother used to intellect we can't
[1:31:28] understand you you know why that you
[1:31:29] can't understand me cuz the way I talk
[1:31:31] you got to have the Holy Ghost to
[1:31:32] understand that's right that's just the
[1:31:35] best way to say it to you that's why
[1:31:36] people don't understand it don't have
[1:31:37] the Holy Ghost that's right you got to
[1:31:39] think about what I
[1:31:40] said I want you to think about what I'm
[1:31:44] saying I want you to think about it in
[1:31:46] the middle of the night I want you to
[1:31:47] pray about it Lord what is that man
[1:31:49] talking
[1:31:50] about then he'll come down and talk to
[1:31:53] you cuz that's what I
[1:31:56] want if I give you all the answers Gary
[1:31:59] what's the problem you don't need to
[1:32:00] study none do
[1:32:02] you but see this is
[1:32:05] personal this is personal but for God to
[1:32:09] say what was Zechariah said that the
[1:32:11] headstone would be coming calling what
[1:32:13] Grace
[1:32:18] Grace now what is any greater message of
[1:32:21] Grace Grace to say he's
[1:32:28] here what could be greater than do you
[1:32:30] to think about not a god up in
[1:32:32] heaven but a God that's in
[1:32:39] you making itself manifest come on
[1:32:42] brother think on these things I just I
[1:32:45] just don't want it to be that people
[1:32:47] will misunderstand me and and you know
[1:32:50] accuse me saying something that that's
[1:32:51] your problem that's your business but to
[1:32:53] misunderstand
[1:32:55] me the coming of the Lord is revealing
[1:32:58] of his word amen cuz he's not coming in
[1:33:00] a Corporal let's stand together not
[1:33:02] coming in a Corporal physical body in
[1:33:04] the end time we meet him in the a right
[1:33:08] all right that's so
[1:33:14] simple but for him to be able to just
[1:33:16] speak through us and say Well done thy
[1:33:19] good and faithful servant enter into the
[1:33:21] joy of the Lord he's going to be present
[1:33:23] to say those
[1:33:24] things what's the
[1:33:27] difference now we're talking about God
[1:33:29] we're not talking about I tried to
[1:33:30] explain it you know if I gave Danny my
[1:33:32] word to go take to somebody that's fine
[1:33:34] if they know all about it and
[1:33:35] everything but it's so much greater in
[1:33:38] God cuz what's the difference in him and
[1:33:40] his
[1:33:43] word well brother Dale I just love to
[1:33:45] see
[1:33:48] God right there in this Bible That's
[1:33:50] where he's at
[1:33:52] no I want to see him well you're just
[1:33:55] like
[1:33:58] Moses Moses wanted to see a physical
[1:34:01] that's human that's that's all right he
[1:34:04] wanted to see something more real than
[1:34:05] he'd
[1:34:07] seen and that's
[1:34:12] fine but you see if you ain't careful
[1:34:15] you get into the devil's trap because he
[1:34:17] can send angels to you and you'll see
[1:34:20] things
[1:34:23] just leave it
[1:34:25] alone and let him come to
[1:34:28] you and then you'll realize reality yes
[1:34:33] and see what's right what we got brother
[1:34:37] 299 299 anybody has a need I'm just
[1:34:41] saying the Lord is
[1:34:46] hereu he is
[1:34:50] here
[1:34:55] he holy
[1:34:57] holy I
[1:35:00] will his name
[1:35:03] again he is
[1:35:12] here your name he is
[1:35:16] here you can touch him you
[1:35:30] the
[1:35:31] just s
[1:35:33] pray and
[1:35:36] believe that way we can commit it to
[1:35:40] him I love it that way father we commit
[1:35:44] this to you Lord we send it fir Claus to
[1:35:48] be what our sister has need of and that
[1:35:51] your you'll come down and you'll
[1:35:54] speak speak to your brother there Lord
[1:35:57] just
[1:35:58] help help his wife help
[1:36:01] them and just let him be one in
[1:36:04] you and to love one another and to see
[1:36:07] all his way would you have
[1:36:11] power in Jesus
[1:36:14] name anybody
[1:36:17] else he is here oh
[1:36:25] his
[1:36:27] name anybody
[1:36:30] else what do you think would encourage
[1:36:33] God most of
[1:36:36] all I mean is there anything you can do
[1:36:41] to to get on the good side of
[1:36:47] God I only know one thing that you can
[1:36:50] do to be on the good side of God and
[1:36:51] that's to believe God's
[1:36:54] word cuz I tried to get you to see that
[1:36:56] the children of Israel Sinn 10 times
[1:36:58] before they come to kades barnea but he
[1:37:00] was still ready to take them
[1:37:03] over he didn't mention it he dealt with
[1:37:06] each individual case and 10 times it'
[1:37:10] sinned but when they didn't believe that
[1:37:12] he was capable of taking them into the
[1:37:14] promised land that's see they were
[1:37:16] doubting his
[1:37:18] word he says to the Wilderness you go
[1:37:22] until you come back to where that you
[1:37:24] can believe see that's what's happened
[1:37:26] to us folks is when the prophet left the
[1:37:28] scene a lot wouldn't there and all that
[1:37:31] but that's part of the journey and part
[1:37:33] of the things but see he wants us to
[1:37:36] realize that he's here that's right you
[1:37:41] know I mean just just to realize that
[1:37:44] he's here yes you
[1:37:47] traveling is one thing Journey coming is
[1:37:50] another thing I've Tri to explain
[1:37:53] it you're all somewhere and you're on
[1:37:55] your way home you know and you call and
[1:37:59] you tell them on the phone you know
