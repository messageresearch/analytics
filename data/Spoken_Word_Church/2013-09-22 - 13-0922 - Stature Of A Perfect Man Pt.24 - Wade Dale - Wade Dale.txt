TRANSCRIPT
========================================
amen here we go now this would be the last part we do on virtue let's look at virtue as a definition it is Conformity to a standard of right morality a particular moral Excellence an order of angels a beneficial quality or power of a thing and this thing slows today would be hello manly strength or courage a commendable quality of trade capacity to act and change to see especially in a woman now this virtue in the Statue of a perfect man we said last week was not virtue as in being a virgin all right it is in a you hot okay well the air conditioner is on so it's very hot okay that one's own right is it higher I just turned it on okay yeah you need to leave them Uncle then get stuffy in this room there's only one event there's only one been in and no return vents so what comes in here stays in here and with all this hot air going on in here anyway Hallelujah virgin it's not a virgin as in virginity it is virtue or what the prophet say it was strength the woman touched the hymn of the Garment Jesus had virtue and that's what we're looking at each one of us is in virtue now remember the woman touched His Garment and got the blessing that she asked for he felt virtue go out but when the men that knowed he was a prophet as a woman at the well put a rag around his head and hit him in the head said now if you're a prophet tell us who hit you they didn't feel no virtue did they it was the way you approach it the same way with the way we approach today in listening to the preachers today we're going to draw virtue off of it or right we're going to sit and and figure out in our brain how to build a house or what you know your mind can be way over under and you draw nothing from it but if you're coming expecting that there is virtue there see that's what you got to do you have confidence we have confidence that we're going to hear from God today okay now so that's what strength and that's what we need for our daily Journey because we are still humans we have human thoughts and ideas and and we're not born again in our spirit and our spirit Realms where we have our trouble there can be things that are unclean in that Realm unclean thoughts something against the brother harsh words hey we go on and on but we got to break through all that and see that the virtue comes from God which is pure and holy and nothing's wrong with him and everything's right and and the word's correct and that's where we get our strength because virtue is something that that's pulled from every angle because you can go home and you can read your Bible and draw virtue or strength from from the not from the physical book but it's from you listening and what did you have faith you got remember add to what you believe if you don't believe that that that God's Gonna help you when you read scripture then you know what just like the men that hit Jesus he he was the well spring he was the whole virtue bottled up in real name and then people beat him and just started with a human being they never drew anything from him at all okay they never do any strength they never do anything like that from him and not drawing from him this thing is not working again okay so turn it off back on again because look Jesus saw the felt virtually go from because somebody wanted something there was a need in somebody's life same way with you and I there's virtue and strength in all Christianity I believe Christianity is virtue that's where you go I mean how you're going to get strength from from this over here or some worldly something over here sure you can draw natural human abilities but that's going to pass away but virtue the virtue of Jesus Christ is what we're looking for not the virtue of Wayne Dale or or Bob black it's not the virtue but it's you're realizing that there's something in there that you can draw from okay that's why the the one that the ones that beat Jesus did not believe so you go back to Faith they did not believe he was a messiah so they didn't get anything yet he was the epitome of that statue of a perfect man had all the virtues in his life had everything working but their unbelief stopped the whole thing now the woman at the well or the woman that had the blood issue now what did she she was looking for something she was looking for some strength she was looking for something that she needed and then here walked Jesus Buy and of course God works on both ends you know he he gave her a desire to know that hey if I could not just touch the man just touch what he wears that's why you look at Paul and I believe that's where Paul got in that's 19 where the people got where they put clothes that were on Paul right passed them out that's prayer Clause that's just like same thing with you and I there's nothing to that piece of paper that piece of paper could come from a garbage can which we know they don't we don't do that but if it cut me if we were out here somewhere working in a field and I had an old dirty rag or something in my hand our daddy had an old dirty rag in his hand working uh when when the when that three inch nail went through all these fingers right here and the thing was sticking in you know this far like my finger and sticking out about like that it went through that finger in this finger and part of the way into that one while I pulled that one out but I have these two here with that nail sticking through it well I just recently pulled the thing out and uh we were working sweaty sawdust and all kind of stuff and that's what you got to do I said well just pray for him so he took his glove off them laid his hands up well his hands were just as dirty as mine but I went over to Mama's house and got some Epsom salt put a little Epsom salt on it never went to the doctor never got a tighten the shot went right back to work that day now honest to goodness the next day it was very sore you drive a three inch nails through both two three fingers and but you remember I told you the uh you can see it right there and there's an X you know how when you nail something and pull the nail out there's kind of an X because the way the points go down well it's still right there on my finger everything that's where that nail went in that's why there's two bumps right there that's where that nail went in it went in right there come out right here and went in that finger got a nail gun I was shooting the nail gun and I missed the board and I was holding the board I missed the board I missed the board and when I hit when I went down I pulled the trigger when I did it went well I went to the doctor about three months later and he said what happened to you because it was still a little bit swole he said what happened to your hand and I told him what happened he said he said well did you have it taken out by a surgeon I said well kinda the great physician was there but when I pulled it out honestly it it was that adrenaline shock at first you know it just shocked you and it doesn't really hurt that bad so the first thing I done real quick I grabbed the head of it and pulled it out so I had it I had it out but he looked at it and he said now what did you do and I told him I said there's a three inch nail now the nail was this big and it's about as big around as well it's almost as big around as this pencil right down here at the bottom about like that and it went through into here into here and in here like that and it was sticking out like that when I pulled it out but um he said well did you have somebody fix it and I said no he said did you have an x-ray I said no I said never even went to the doctor I said my dad prayed for it we believe in prayer went down pray for it he said well I surgically couldn't have put that surgically he said I couldn't have moved your you have a tendon going here and you have a tendon going here copying body if it breaks this tendon here your finger always falls down it never will come back up if a tendon's here your feet is going to be straight forever and you're never going to be able to do anything to keep your fingers straight and he said and there's little bitty bones in there and he said you didn't see any bones I said no no bone come out nothing I mean when I pulled it out went over to Mama's and put the Epsom salt on it I didn't do no more and peroxide put a little peroxide on it but I never never stopped but I believed there was some virtue standing there this is my point I believe there was some virtue standing there that I didn't have to run to the doctor again right because when he prayed for it I said well that's it he said what are you going to do I said let's go back to work and he said you need to go over there to the house and put some Epsom salt or something or get Nanny to find something to put on it so anyway the doctor said I couldn't have surgically placed that nail in your finger and not hit this tendon or this tendon or a bone he said there's not but just a little just a micrometer amount of room between this tendon that tendon and there's a bone that runs through there too he said that nail must have went right over between and it didn't go through them or I would not have had any use of this thing I said well I said thank God that in my stupidity he put the nail through there the right way you know he put the nail through there the right way my guardian angel was sitting there you know diagnosing it and then when it happened it was done so you see there there's no amen I was careful from then on that's not like we were reading it's not let's not be stupid amen so well if God healed out I think I'll just you know that's stupidity and that being well let's not tempt God right right that's tempting god let's don't say God well you took me out of this I'm gonna do it again and see you taking no he may be far away from there because you know what it's the approach because God is where the virtue comes from and what if God and we're going to see it this afternoon what if God has condescended down and wants you to be God if we're the last and morphy of God then where do we draw strength from we draw strength from God sure through prayer but I believe the Bible says that there's five full ministry that's going to perfect the Saints so to get your Perfection you're going to have to listen to a preacher that's right I have to listen to a preacher that's the problem preachers don't think they listen have to listen to preachers no and I've heard some of them and they definitely need to be listening to preacher all right but the way they they just get up and start preaching they open their mouth and nothing comes out there's no virtue but see we draw virtue and strength from the things that we what believe in so see you drop off everything we're going to look at and I really didn't realize this until until just a few months ago when we first got started with this everything that's why my brother Brown said all this is based on faith well I knew the quote well you've got to take virtue and you don't do away with faith you've got to come right back to that Faith have faith in virtue you got to come up to knowledge you got to drop right back to Faith and have faith that's why I said let's put it this way after what you believe virtue then add to what you believe knowledge then add to what you believe temperament because you got to believe that you can have temperature if you don't believe you have temperatures you can't have it right you got to believe and you got to believe there's a place you can go to get it that's right see that's important but see there's a way been made for us to get it there's a there's an Avenue through the prophet's message and now through the fivefold ministry where you can draw virtue and strength from a five-fold Ministry are from listening to tapes and and you know things like that you can do that and and draw a string from but to get perfected that says statue of a perfect man you got to always come back to a five-fold ministry that's why we believe in a faithful Ministry we don't believe in a onefold we believe in a five-fold Ministry there's five different avenues that God brings you virtue and strength from all right let's go to the next one so here's the Greek Lexicon definition which is coming straight from Peter there in the Bible which is dunamis dunamis which is what power Mighty work strength miracles strength power and ability now number one a inherent power see that inherent power power residing In A Thing by virtue of its nature that's how you can draw strength from it that's brother Dale if you saw him last week in a bar and you saw him with another woman and now and him come and preach the gospel that's another nature then what you're expecting of a virtuous person so can you draw strength on that no same thing with us that's why a life lived all right come on now brother Brown said a life lived is where we're missing it the life live brings these I believe a life live brings these things automatically right they have to come to that life all right so now look or which a person or thing exerts and puts forth right power for performing Miracles or moral power and Excellence of soul moral power and Excellence of soul all right see there's even a man man's ability the power and influence which belongs to riches and wealth you can draw virtue from that people like Dave Ramsey and people like that you can draw virtue because they're wealthy I mean you really it's like Dad said you really don't want to read a book about how to raise kids from a single parent and he was an only child it just gets worse and worse you know I mean and how can you draw how can you pick that book up and say man I'm going to really get something out of this well you might but it might not be what you want what you think you're gonna get but what about somebody that's got four or five kids and been married 30 something years I had a friend of mine the other day um plays a friend of Zacks actually a young boy named Chris Porter well he took over a church over in Banks County called Rock Spring Jacob and I were talking about it the other day and we made him on the road over there he was running so we kind of got in a conversation about it not to him but um he's 23. that close to exact same age 23. and he's pastoring a church this is people been married longer and he's been born now not saying anything against the bull I think he does he'll do a good job if he'll what he needs to do is get a bunch of them older guys and get them close to him he didn't see so he's going to draw virtue if he will he's going to draw virtue off them older people but how in the world can he just like Jacob said how in the world is he going to sit down with somebody I've been married 35 years and go we're having a problem with our marriage and he's been married what six months or something you know I think he just got married so there's really you can't draw I would have a problem with drawing some virtues on that but now somebody had been married 40 years or 30 years and you've been married 30 years I can sit down and relate and you can have a there's a drawing power there okay but God will give you Godly virtue to be able to help I'm not saying that young people can't help older people but I think the Bible never says that the Bible says the older will teach the younger okay I never saw it in there where it said the younger will teach you older all right now some young person with a holy ghost though can help you okay so let's don't get all that all messed up that we don't have you know I'm I'm 53 years old and anything below me I'm not listening to you hey as you get older there's a lot of people back on that side that they are on that side like a man said the other day it was 80 something years old he said I don't have many friends anymore he said they're dying okay so we can have the power and influence which belongs to rich as well power and resources arising from numbers power consisting and are resting upon Army's forces and hosts now that's man's ability of strength but now watch Luke 6 19 up there was a whole bunch of people touched him one day where there went virtue out of him and healed them all so they all were looking for something they all were able to touch Jesus and get what they expected not just one person and then we see where Jesus said who touched me when all denied Peter said they were winning Master the multitude throwing the impressed then saith who touched me because see Peter saw that there was hundreds of people around him probably touching him and pushing him and and you know all kind of stuff but that woman just crawled up underneath there and just reached and touched the Hem of His Garment Jesus said somebody hath touched me now he was not talking in the human sense then right okay that wasn't the human man Jesus talking you understand sure it was a human man Jesus but Jesus that's why they couldn't understand they're like well Peter said well man everybody's touching you they're pressing you so hard I can't hardly keep them off of you and you said who touched me yeah there's a hundred people texting and you said someone somebody have touched me for I perceive that virtue has gone out of me and then what what did he do the Bible says he turns and he called her spirit he contacted her spirit and then what did he do he said woman forever them 20 something years or whatever it was 30 years that you've had that problem healing healed instantly because she had went to the Fountain of all virtue I think we read this one the other day but let's look at number 29 now I believe the virtue is in Christ and Christ is the word all right the virtues in Christ but but it's Christ in you the hope of glory though if it's Christ in you we're going to see something this afternoon we're gonna we're gonna visit an old an old scripture that I enjoy preaching on Genesis 1 26 and 27. we're going to see a little something maybe the Lord showed me on my lawnmower the other day it's already interact I had to get another one if he listen is intent if y'all will listen to his intentions he did you'll get something out of it I guess it's a hate but in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us we're going to read that scripture today but I want you to see something that that I believe we're missing in that Genesis 1 26 and 27 man now the word itself comes back in the form of the Holy Spirit into us and it's word in you right so if you draw strengths on the word and the words in you then that's what we're talking about we're drawing strength from the word that's in you all right um so many wants to point God to some mystical something way away are so far away they overreach it God is in you the hope of glory Christ the mind that was in Christ in you you're reaching Plum away from it trying to get what's been given to you God in the human being pretty good all right statue of perfect bad man the Bible says we read over here in the Book of Luke where it says virtue went out of him that's right turn against to the men we're going to be like him we must have virtue then we must have it to be like him is the first song that I ever loved was to be like Jesus I've got to have virgin and a past that can pass forward from me to the people if you got virtue and you keep it what good is it Jesus said I give my life I lay down my life for what you so you can draw virtue off of it so he can come back to the people because virtue went out of him to the people virtue and before you can let it out you got to have it first you haven't got it it won't come out there's nothing for it to come out up what if someone tried to draw virtue out of us and the check would return insufficient funds see no no none there to draw from check them out somebody looked at you as a Christian and Demarest you aren't here at home like a center not much pressure can be drawn from that all right let's read this right here virtue must be in us and until we get virtue now look when then when we get true virtue we can add it to our faith face the foundation can add it to our faith that's the next foundation wall now first you must have faith faith alone won't do it how you like that you ever read that before faith alone won't do it you got to have these ads all right faith alone won't do it you've got Peter said then add virgin to your faith you must have virtue in order to add it to your faith now then it might be the reason you don't have it because many churches of the day teach you don't have to have it same way in the message I always was eternal I don't and I got I was born with eternal life and all this all this stuff huh I I don't I don't see that I see that we have to grow in Grace and knowledge we have to receive the new birth we have to be born again all right because many churches of today teach you don't have to have it or the days of it has passed they don't have to have it the only thing you have to do is just join the church or believe the message can I say that same thing that's what he's saying right here all you have to do is just come to a message church and and and and and and just start believing and and then that's all no I'm gonna read your quote today from the future home that brother Brown said I've taught three works of Grace from the beginning and I thank God I'm still teaching it now so I don't see where a lot of people a lot of preachers have told me that brother Brown after the seals bro changed the way he preached the new birth I that to me that's a lie to me that's a lie that's the lie because it's not true but they're taking the quotes it's like I told Jim the other day they've got the cow they've got the grass and they've got the tree so they've got the quotes in the Bible they got the picture but they've got the cow eating grass in the top of the tree they don't have their picture put right but thank God we've got a a teacher up there and he's going to be preaching some on it today too that can put the thing together and and let me say this they have to there's many doctrines so I want you to be able to draw virtue off of what you hear there's many doctrines see the Parisian Doctrine the two Soul dogs and every Doctrine in the message has quote so it was bred around that confused did he have that many doctrines in this one message that we hold so dear he can't right but but dad's the old brother that was the only preacher I've ever seen that takes every quote that even seems contrary and lays them out there and puts them together unless the Holy Ghost put them together for you not man because I've heard these people preach just over here well they've got their 25 quotes that they drill on over here but what about this one over here right I always was eternal I have eternal life I was born in the world a baby with eternal life Lord have you heard it on the internet then brother random over here on adoption he says your eternal life begins at the offer right and how confused is that they said oh he always was a grain of wheat or always was an eagle brother Brown and I got 15 quotes for brother Brown said I was a cup of her but when the life of the wheat came in I became a win the life of the week came in right I became a week now see there's a change there now he's not that confused we are right because if you deny one quote then you've got brother Brown you're saying he was wrong here but he was right here same way with the Daniel 70 wins there's many quotes it sounds like it's contrary but they're not once you put them all together it's a beautiful picture and thank God that we can draw virtue from that virtue anyone knows what the word virtue means see we must have it if virtue went from him to heal the woman that was sick he's expecting the same virtue in his church because he was our example and if he had virtue to give to the people he expects us to have virtue to give to the people and what is virtue virtuous strength all right dunamis power so does anybody got any questions or anything on virtue there's The Virtue that's the that's the um life inside working its way out that's the same thing but faith alone can't do it now wrote around and said faith alone faith will get you in a rapture faith will put you in the body of Christ all right but faith will not make you a perfect man a complete man in the economy of God sure your son of God sure you're just as Eternal as God is but God doesn't want just that he don't want you just to have faith he wants to have faith in himself but at least it's then you gotta have faith in yourself first this is where the virtue comes from and you guys say hey I gotta have this but I don't walk around saying now Trudy's got to have it since crudy's got to have it now she just got to have virgin well that'll do you very good that ain't got a lot of virgins I ain't got a lot of uh knowledge bring a lot of knowledge all these things tie together so next week we're gonna I want you to look up the word knowledge in the dictionary and look up the word knowledge in the Bible because you're going to get a bond subscription but look up both of them and bring them with you when I quote them you'll know who they are all right let's go foreign
