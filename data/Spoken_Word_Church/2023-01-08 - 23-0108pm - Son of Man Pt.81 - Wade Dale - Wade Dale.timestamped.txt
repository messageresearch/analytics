[10:59] of them sometimes just relief that
[11:02] God has been good and I've been like I
[11:04] said I'm a witness of his resurrected
[11:06] power
[11:08] you know
[11:10] the Lord visited me many times and like
[11:13] John said from the little kids coming up
[11:16] I always sharing testimony with them oh
[11:18] the Lord visit me or what he showed me
[11:20] are what he tells me you know so I
[11:23] remember my friend Mary
[11:27] she was my best friend to me and I
[11:28] always give her my testimony them and
[11:30] one day she had she come to me and said
[11:32] she had three dreams and it bothering
[11:35] her and she said could I intercede and
[11:37] final from the Lord what did his dream
[11:39] mean
[11:40] and I said okay I will
[11:42] so I went down the closet at night and I
[11:45] was praying and waiting on the Lord to
[11:46] come waiting for his present you know
[11:48] because he always visit me to have the
[11:51] experience of knowing how to get out of
[11:54] the way so he can come in
[11:55] and I'm about your footstep was coming
[11:57] in the closet while I was waiting and
[12:00] all of a sudden I Heard a Voice spoke to
[12:01] me and said
[12:03] get up and turn on your right side so I
[12:06] turn I get up I'm gonna turn to my right
[12:08] side there goes my friend in a vision
[12:11] laying on our left side so we were back
[12:13] to back and anyway she told me dream
[12:16] bother her so I began to dream
[12:19] the dream that she had it was happening
[12:21] to me
[12:22] and I was scared because I was
[12:24] interested I was trying to get the
[12:25] interpretation of those dreams but
[12:29] she when she told me a dream
[12:31] about the dark shirt and the Bush was
[12:33] coming at her she began to have
[12:34] nightmare
[12:35] and she was screaming for God but yet
[12:37] I'm in the closet I'm going through all
[12:39] that my and everything was happening to
[12:41] me what she told me and I was screaming
[12:43] out and I was scared
[12:45] and then all of a sudden
[12:47] I Heard a Voice spoke to me and said
[12:49] this is the interpretation of the dream
[12:52] and at that time I couldn't wait to get
[12:54] out the dream so I can go and tell her
[12:56] what it meant
[12:57] and in the dream it was I heard the
[12:59] voice said um the shot that was coming
[13:01] out from the Bush was our death she you
[13:04] know if she didn't give our heart to God
[13:05] she was gonna die
[13:07] so you have to give our heart to the
[13:09] Lord but I couldn't wait to get all that
[13:11] dreams to go to her and call her and
[13:13] tell her what the dream mean
[13:15] so I call her ER after I got out the
[13:18] dream but she didn't tell me a certain
[13:20] part of the dream there was a little
[13:22] girl in there about five years old she
[13:24] didn't tell me a little girl or her
[13:25] sister but yet I seen all that so I
[13:28] asked her who was the daughter the
[13:29] little girl she said that was her niece
[13:31] and actually I was the other girl that I
[13:34] saw a lady she said that was her sister
[13:36] and I told her everything
[13:39] so she had to give her all to God and
[13:41] she would die
[13:42] and that was that on that so and there's
[13:45] another time okay tell one more
[13:49] I was laying down into in my room
[13:51] and our divorce said get up and run
[13:53] through the run through it all so I I
[13:56] don't like Darkness so I was kind of
[13:58] scared but I got up on running down the
[14:00] hall
[14:01] and then I was shaking me like I'm
[14:03] scared of dark and then I said when I
[14:06] get back to where I was I heard I said
[14:08] to myself if God told me to run I can't
[14:10] run so scared let me give him a good run
[14:12] and I run I run again
[14:14] and I was still kind of scared but that
[14:16] was more braver and I said I'm gonna do
[14:18] a better one and I did the third time
[14:20] and I went and lay in my bed
[14:22] and then we're looking up to the ceiling
[14:24] and I saw that same light that was our
[14:26] brother Brandon it was in the ceiling
[14:27] like so it began to move towards the
[14:29] wall so I'm falling in my eyesight and
[14:32] there was no more wall then I heard like
[14:34] Bush was burning
[14:36] and I didn't know where where it was but
[14:38] I looked to see what was going on and I
[14:40] got I heard a great explosion and when I
[14:43] turned to look for the explosions all I
[14:45] could see was the closing up of the
[14:46] explosion and I came to out of that
[14:49] vision
[14:50] so um I saw a brother bring him a
[14:53] testify and talk about a vision like
[14:55] that and you have the picture in the
[14:57] same picture I see of the explosion and
[15:00] I said wow oh God let me see that for
[15:03] some reason like I said I've got many
[15:05] more testimony and I just can't wait I
[15:07] couldn't wait to give some relief some
[15:09] from my for me you know supporting the
[15:11] Lord for the experience that he gave me

[34:15] have a prayer meeting
[34:17] oh not having Bible study this month
[34:19] we'll have it next month this month
[34:20] we're having the youth service which
[34:22] will be the 28th and 29th so just keep
[34:24] those things in your prayers pray for
[34:26] all of us uh Mr Cole you know getting on
[34:29] all of us and we want to uh we want to
[34:33] be healthy y'all like to be sick no I
[34:36] don't either I'm going to answer it for
[34:37] you I don't like feeling bad
[34:39] I don't like feeling I don't like
[34:41] feeling like I need to go back to bed
[34:42] and and you know
[34:44] uh weight of the world's on your head
[34:46] and everything else so we we just thank
[34:49] God that we have a A Healer
[34:53] that God can do that and he wants to
[34:56] more than we want him to do it right so
[34:59] let's call on him use him he's not going
[35:01] to get tired there's one thing for sure
[35:03] you draw virtue out of him now you'll
[35:05] never make him tired now he was tired
[35:07] when he was in human flesh but when he
[35:09] got out of human flesh or glorified body
[35:11] human flesh he's not tired never will be
[35:15] tired anymore it doesn't matter how many
[35:16] times you ask him
[35:19] excuse me
[35:23] picked up a feather
[35:24] feather so let's go to this this would
[35:26] be part 81 and we're going to try to get
[35:28] into knowledge
[35:30] um and remember as we speak on knowledge
[35:32] remember there's two forms of knowledge
[35:36] there's a knowledge that the world has
[35:38] there's a knowledge that God has
[35:41] all right so we've got to decipher which
[35:44] one if you if you use the knowledge of
[35:47] God you will never fail
[35:49] you use the knowledge of man uh you
[35:53] might make it in life and you don't be
[35:55] you know make some good money because
[35:56] you know about the first one thing in
[35:58] another or or your Life's a little bit
[36:00] better but I have never I've known a few
[36:02] millionaires a couple of them and
[36:04] they're not happy either
[36:06] they're not happy either they got just
[36:07] many problems you do they just don't
[36:09] have Bill problem you know they just but
[36:11] they have other problems you know why
[36:13] because remember the Rich Young Ruler
[36:15] what did he do he went and built him
[36:16] some more barns
[36:18] and you know what God did he just took
[36:19] his life
[36:21] he took his life he said no you know no
[36:24] no you you're done all right she turned
[36:27] God down and we know where he was at
[36:28] when Lazarus and he and Lazarus met
[36:31] didn't meet but they talked to each
[36:32] other in that other dimension so let's
[36:34] remember all these things in prayer
[36:37] um that we'll come back Wednesday night
[36:38] and brother Aaron will be speaking for
[36:40] us so let's
[36:41] let's bow our heads Lord Jesus
[36:44] thank you so much that we can come one
[36:45] more time lord and we can speak about
[36:47] you father now I pray Lord that you
[36:50] would be with each one Lord and the
[36:51] sound of my voice that you would bless
[36:53] them Father and keep the soul coveted
[36:55] and flus we know there's different
[36:56] strains and different
[36:58] uh names that man has put on it but it's
[37:01] just the devil and he's trying to strike
[37:04] young people and older people too father
[37:07] we pray that you'd just push that away
[37:09] from us Lord that we'll all have a good
[37:11] time on you father you'll bless us now
[37:13] in the furthermen of this service be
[37:15] with the ones that are sick Lord that
[37:17] are not with us today we pray that you'd
[37:19] be with them be the ones that are online
[37:21] watching in Lord just take care of them
[37:23] Lord give them Supernatural Revelation
[37:26] father and give us sitting here in the
[37:29] building Lord Supernatural Revelation
[37:31] without it we can't survive brother
[37:32] Brown said the bride loves Revelation
[37:35] the father I pray that you do that today
[37:37] reveal yourself to us Lord through your
[37:39] word Lord just forgive us of our sins
[37:41] and many mistakes Lord in Jesus name we
[37:43] pray amen
[37:45] in the beginning was the word where it
[37:47] was with God and the Word was God we're
[37:49] going to kind of kick it up another gear
[37:51] today because we've got we don't have
[37:52] any visitors with us so we can kick it
[37:55] up just a little bit today I love
[37:56] visitors I mean that that helped me this
[37:59] morning just as much to just kind of
[38:00] back up and um and speak for a minute on
[38:04] on a couple of items that was generic
[38:07] enough to where they could understand
[38:08] what I was talking about so I pray that
[38:11] they'll come back amen
[38:15] listen if you don't want people saved
[38:16] you need to get saved yourself
[38:18] hey man me and no more no I don't want
[38:22] no no I want everybody safe everybody
[38:25] you say the devil yeah I'd love to have
[38:27] the devil say that way he wouldn't
[38:29] bother me as much he wouldn't bother me
[38:31] anymore but he's our adversary and he
[38:34] can't get saved and we we um we know
[38:37] that um that he's if Jesus is the ever
[38:40] present help in time of trouble we know
[38:43] who's our trouble
[38:44] the devil's our trouble so in the
[38:46] beginning with the word where was with
[38:47] God and the Word was God and that word
[38:49] was transformed to flesh and dwelt among
[38:52] us and we behold his glory the glory the
[38:53] only begotten and the father
[38:55] full of grace and truth one morning
[38:57] you'll be seated Genesis 2 9. right from
[39:00] the get-go God's going to split this
[39:01] thing up he's going to split it up into
[39:03] two trees and out of the ground made the
[39:05] Lord to grow every tree that's Pleasant
[39:06] to the site good for food
[39:08] Tree of Life in the midst of the garden
[39:09] and the tree of knowledge of Good and
[39:13] Evil you can go and be seated in the
[39:15] Lord has blessing to the reading of the
[39:16] word Isaiah 28 9 says Whom Shall he
[39:19] teach knowledge and Whom Shall he make
[39:21] to understand Doctrine you know we we as
[39:24] we were talking this morning about the
[39:25] little child
[39:26] we all every one of us started out first
[39:30] grade kindergarten first grade one plus
[39:32] one's two hey man we didn't get the a
[39:35] plus b equals c for a while
[39:37] we didn't get the trigonometry we didn't
[39:39] get to the Pythagorean theorem I don't
[39:42] know some of y'all don't even know what
[39:43] that is I know Aaron does
[39:46] and no air knows everything
[39:49] and that well the other day I said
[39:52] something about something he said I
[39:53] don't know what that is
[39:55] we studied it but you know what wouldn't
[39:56] have known that if it hadn't been for
[39:58] somebody to teach me
[39:59] amen if somebody hadn't teased me I
[40:01] wouldn't it's just not gonna pop up in
[40:03] your head and that's the same way with
[40:04] with being in the message of the hour
[40:06] and that's the same way with being with
[40:08] the speaking of the word of God God's
[40:10] not going to make you read it
[40:14] he's not gonna make you steady
[40:18] you're going to want to and therefore
[40:20] he'll already have it there for you same
[40:22] way with the teacher if a teacher gets
[40:25] up and and the teacher that's teaching
[40:27] your class you walk in what would it be
[40:29] if you walk in the door and and well and
[40:32] say college my baseball coach taught
[40:36] uh calculus in college and
[40:39] and if I would have looked at at the
[40:41] coach and I and and he was only about
[40:43] seven years old when I walked in the
[40:45] door
[40:45] he's teaching the class
[40:47] and he's seven
[40:50] that would be strange wouldn't it
[40:54] but the coach had been a coach for a
[40:56] long time and he'd been a teacher for
[40:57] like 30 years because he retired the
[40:59] year I was that I was there in Piedmont
[41:01] and uh he'd been taught so I had
[41:04] confidence then what I had confidence he
[41:07] could teach me
[41:08] I had confidence he had heard enough of
[41:10] the word he had heard enough of the
[41:12] trigonometry calculus and all the
[41:14] different things that he knew what he
[41:16] was talking about
[41:18] it was just it would just take it and
[41:21] get this and you can giggle if you want
[41:22] to it took something Supernatural to get
[41:25] it to us
[41:26] everybody say Amen yeah so it's going to
[41:30] take something Supernatural to get the
[41:32] word of God to us
[41:33] we're Supernatural people we love
[41:35] Revelation brother Brown said we Thrive
[41:37] off a revelation all right so what we're
[41:40] why are we thriving off Revelation
[41:42] because we want to know more about God
[41:44] we want to know that he's hidden and
[41:46] revealed we know it's in Simplicity but
[41:48] look it's hidden and revealed
[41:52] in simplicity so it is hidden
[41:55] and it is revealed in Simplicity all
[41:58] right
[41:59] and truly I have some teachers we had
[42:02] one we were talking about the other day
[42:03] doc says and uh he was my math teacher
[42:07] and he made it he was so intelligent
[42:11] but he could he could get you to
[42:13] understand and to me that's a wonderful
[42:14] teacher
[42:15] that's not so far uphill like you that'd
[42:18] be like Einstein coming in here and
[42:19] trying to teach us the
[42:20] theory of relativity you'd be going
[42:24] I don't have Clay what's going on but
[42:27] somewhere down the line somebody learned
[42:29] that theory of relativity and they were
[42:32] able to break it down to a group of
[42:34] people or break it down to a college
[42:36] group of people and they learned about
[42:38] that same way with the Pythagorean
[42:40] theorem and all these other things you
[42:42] know he can say that but some of you
[42:43] don't know what it is why you haven't
[42:44] been in school
[42:46] not that I'm I'm not dishing anybody I'm
[42:48] just saying you have not learned that
[42:49] because you have not studied that
[42:51] we don't know about the word of God
[42:53] unless we study the word of God we don't
[42:56] know about what God's got for us until
[42:58] we get there's only one listen there's
[43:00] not any other curriculum
[43:02] come on right
[43:04] man we had listen when I was going to
[43:06] college
[43:07] they still Drew on blackboards
[43:11] and the kids are going what's a
[43:13] Blackboard
[43:16] man I used to be king of the Eraser um
[43:19] cleaner because that mean I could go
[43:21] outside and I'd be the teacher's pet you
[43:23] know and I could do what I wanted to but
[43:25] I do I don't know what that is no
[43:26] letting most of you going
[43:30] you mean it's not on a no but God give
[43:32] us one it took me six or eight or ten
[43:35] different books that I had to buy every
[43:37] year every quarter
[43:39] that I had that it was required that I
[43:42] have them to learn my study but God only
[43:45] gives us one
[43:46] it's not very large War and Peace is
[43:49] bigger than this is It's only got 66
[43:52] chapters
[43:54] 66 books sorry 66 books so that's what
[43:58] we got and then the world then is what
[44:00] uh is is
[44:04] if you don't have the Holy Ghost it's a
[44:06] mysterious book Let's just put it that
[44:07] way it's a mysterious book to 99 of the
[44:10] people in this world because about 80
[44:12] percent don't even think it's real
[44:15] and even like
[44:17] um Jim's um Dad's girlfriend she says
[44:19] well I don't think it's just the
[44:21] absolute it's just something people you
[44:23] know she would be to me it would be like
[44:25] this she wrote this and then somebody
[44:27] else wrote this and somebody else wrote
[44:28] this and we just kind of put them all
[44:30] together and mix it up in a bowl and
[44:32] whatever pops out that's what it is they
[44:35] God don't work way his way like that
[44:38] God says you're going to listen to this
[44:40] this is how you're going to get it
[44:41] you're going to get it through the
[44:42] foolishness of preaching and you're
[44:43] going to have to have knowledge and
[44:45] somebody's got to teach you Whom Shall
[44:47] he teach knowledge
[44:49] you were not born with knowledge your
[44:52] brain is wired yes to a certain way and
[44:55] there are others there are some that are
[44:57] smarter than others but I believe
[44:59] everybody starts on the same basis it's
[45:01] just what you want to do with it
[45:03] and that's what you want to do is what
[45:05] you want to understand same thing with
[45:07] the word of God you can sit here and
[45:08] listen to brother Dale for 50 years and
[45:10] not and be in first grade
[45:12] I don't see how
[45:16] but
[45:18] you can't do that
[45:19] and like I said before then we didn't
[45:21] come to church and listen to a seventh
[45:23] grade teacher
[45:27] please listen please don't go to sleep
[45:29] I've only been here five minutes
[45:32] but we didn't expect brother Dale to be
[45:34] seven years old and not know anything
[45:36] and be a novice no he knew what he was
[45:37] talking about
[45:39] and then we evolved or revolved from
[45:42] that and we did drink milk milk's good
[45:45] milk's okay but milk's not everything
[45:49] but he says who what who shall make to
[45:51] understand Doctrine every church has to
[45:53] have a Doctrine
[45:55] every Church brother Brian set a church
[45:57] without a doctrines not a church so we
[45:59] have a Doctrine what is it all the truth
[46:03] amen we believe in serpent seed we
[46:07] believe in predestination the right way
[46:09] we believe in Daniel 7 who eats the
[46:11] right way we believe in the opening of
[46:13] the seals the right way so I believe
[46:15] we're in the right Institution
[46:18] that's probably not a good word to use
[46:21] there are institutions for people like
[46:23] me but
[46:27] I think we have a real good
[46:28] understanding of Doctrine so what I'm
[46:31] saying is so what so we should be weaned
[46:33] from the milk and drawn from the breast
[46:35] in other words we should be what they
[46:37] call it they call it weaning them off
[46:39] where you have a little bit you know you
[46:41] have a little bit of milk a little bit
[46:42] of milk but what do you do you feed them
[46:44] other things
[46:45] and that's what's been going on I
[46:47] believe for the last 50 something years
[46:48] we've been fed other things than just
[46:51] milk
[46:52] we have been fed Doctrine we've been fed
[46:54] the meat of the Bible we've not had any
[46:57] scarecrows popped up I like what a
[46:59] minister said the other day he said
[47:01] scarecrows scare crows
[47:04] yeah it don't scare Eagles
[47:08] I've never heard of a scary eagle
[47:10] there's scarecrows to scare the crows
[47:13] well we're not crows we're Eagles
[47:15] amen
[47:17] Isaiah 53 says look
[47:20] he shall see the travail of his soul and
[47:22] shall be satisfied by his knowledge
[47:24] shall my righteous servant justify many
[47:28] so Jesus Christ look he was the master
[47:31] scholar
[47:33] that Jesus Christ was the master scholar
[47:36] amen
[47:38] it only took him three and a half years
[47:42] to teach this Doctrine that's totally
[47:45] worldwide
[47:48] three and a half years ago that's all he
[47:50] had he didn't speak anymore he didn't
[47:52] speak any before he didn't speak any
[47:53] after
[47:55] but by his knowledge shall my righteous
[47:57] servant justify many for he shall bear
[48:00] their iniquities in other words he's
[48:02] going to Bear let me put it this way
[48:04] he's going to Bear my stupidity
[48:10] his knowledge is not listened God's
[48:13] knowledge is not good I think what Satan
[48:15] thinks he says if I can get enough
[48:16] people to agree that there's not a god
[48:19] there won't be one
[48:22] he's crazy
[48:24] he's crazy
[48:26] because that man that created him is
[48:28] never going to go out of existence
[48:30] and that's the God I serve that's the
[48:32] husband I have that's the Savior that I
[48:35] have that Satan could have had in the
[48:36] beginning but he couldn't
[48:38] because what iniquity was found in him
[48:40] and you know what he sended it away so
[48:42] God can't cover his iniquity
[48:46] because you can send away your day of
[48:48] Grace and God's iniquity there's no I
[48:49] mean your iniquity will override God all
[48:52] the time
[48:53] from here till the day of judgment all
[48:55] right
[48:56] so now we talked about this morning real
[48:58] quick sanctification clean and set aside
[49:00] for service the unclean Spirit goes out
[49:01] we were talking about only chart if you
[49:03] pull that chart up just for a second I
[49:04] want everybody to understand when we
[49:06] start talking about now the unclean
[49:07] spirits going out of a man it's not in
[49:09] your soul
[49:10] if you're born again in your soul you
[49:13] have zero unclean spirits in your soul
[49:16] zero God and the devil can't be in there
[49:19] at the same time
[49:21] that's why you were born in sin shaping
[49:23] and iniquity in your soul because that
[49:25] soul is the real you that's the real
[49:27] person
[49:28] that's why I believe you're talking
[49:30] about the little baby going to have all
[49:31] babies go to heaven well what is their
[49:33] memory they have no memory of anything
[49:35] bad
[49:37] they don't have to reason
[49:40] they'll start having a conscience and
[49:42] when they start having a conscience
[49:43] that's when the age of accountability
[49:45] where they're going to have to know
[49:46] right from wrong and they're gonna have
[49:48] to make a what a decision they'll make a
[49:50] decision one way or the other and so
[49:52] have you we've made a decision one way
[49:55] or the other so the soul is where Faith
[49:58] or doubt not faith and doubt so we got
[50:00] to see that the holy of holies
[50:02] it's closed if you're born again
[50:06] and now we're talking about the spirit
[50:07] realm the memory reason conscious
[50:09] affection imagination that's where we're
[50:11] talking about the unclean spirits are
[50:13] able to work in mine in your life that's
[50:18] our problem
[50:20] s not in your soul if you're born again
[50:24] if you're truly born again
[50:26] please don't try to go backwards
[50:29] don't try to go back and clean the soul
[50:31] up that God's already cleaned up
[50:34] now if it's not yes you better get it
[50:37] cleaned up because listen that's what's
[50:39] going to stand in judgment
[50:41] and God's going to judge your soul he's
[50:43] not going to judge yours flesh right
[50:47] right so that sinneth it shall surely
[50:50] die the soul not the body the soul that
[50:53] sent it that's where you send from you
[50:55] send from your soul you do not Sin from
[50:58] your flesh now when you get to that next
[51:01] realm now when brother Brown talks about
[51:03] a Christian sins every day well now when
[51:05] a Christian sins every day it's not from
[51:07] here
[51:09] right right
[51:10] obviously if you're a Christian is faith
[51:13] where are you sending from you're
[51:15] letting your affection take over
[51:18] humanly you let your human reasoning
[51:21] take over you're letting your human
[51:23] memory your human conscious your human
[51:25] imagination you're letting them into
[51:28] that inner court and you're letting them
[51:31] take over this guy
[51:34] everybody with me on that the spirit man
[51:36] and and we live in that Spirit now you
[51:38] know brother Brown says the soul is the
[51:40] nature of the spirit absolutely
[51:43] absolutely
[51:45] whatever's in your soul your spirit is
[51:48] going to react to what's in your soul
[51:51] because I didn't it didn't bother me
[51:52] like I said before it didn't bother me
[51:55] to
[52:00] it didn't bother me to lust
[52:03] when I didn't have anything in there but
[52:04] now
[52:09] it bothers you when you start talking
[52:11] about stuff like that no I was a human
[52:13] being
[52:14] foreign
[52:15] I reasoned against the word of God I
[52:18] said I'm not going to church until mama
[52:20] calls
[52:23] and then I reasoned that I better come
[52:25] on
[52:26] but I didn't want to be here
[52:28] because I sat there and in my conscience
[52:30] I was thinking about everything else
[52:33] she took me out of the ball game I was
[52:35] gonna watch
[52:38] oh y'all didn't do that okay I
[52:41] I'm preaching the Saints today
[52:45] Saints and Hanks and my imagination oh
[52:48] my could you
[52:49] look at when you were
[52:51] when you were not born again the
[52:53] imagination you had in your what you had
[52:55] in your head
[52:56] everybody shake your head yeah that
[52:59] imagination that you know what never
[53:02] would come to pass but it occupied your
[53:04] time
[53:06] I'm gonna win that Lottery if I go just
[53:08] one more ticket
[53:09] that is your imagination taking over
[53:14] and then your reasoning is well if I
[53:16] don't play I'll never win
[53:18] yeah right so the devil just keeps
[53:21] throwing it so anyway
[53:24] it tickles me then guys that were at uh
[53:26] at the city they want to they don't want
[53:28] nothing to do with gambling they don't
[53:30] want nothing to do with a you know that
[53:31] was a uh the other day or no about two
[53:34] years ago they said it was going to be a
[53:35] casino built down at the craving pop
[53:37] property that big white fence in front
[53:39] of my house oh they were so up in arms
[53:41] and
[53:42] of course I went to Mayor at the time
[53:43] but the mayor I asked him I said what do
[53:47] you do out there in front of the
[53:48] convenience store what's on front of
[53:49] your truck he's waiting somebody I said
[53:51] you out there scratching the paint off
[53:53] your truck
[53:54] he said no I said what are you doing I
[53:57] said oh you're scratching lottery
[53:58] tickets
[53:59] you're gambling
[54:03] why worry about a gambling house you
[54:05] just made your own
[54:11] so where are we talking about now we
[54:13] have moved into that Spirit realm and
[54:15] we've had for a while but right here
[54:16] when we were down here at faith we were
[54:19] talking about what faith or doubt the
[54:21] soul of man okay so we went through
[54:23] justification sanctification which took
[54:26] the unclean Spirit out of here and put
[54:29] God's spirit in here
[54:30] close this off
[54:33] because once you're born again it's
[54:34] closed off the womb has been sealed it
[54:36] can nothing else can go in nothing else
[54:39] can come out all right so look right
[54:41] here now this is going to be where the
[54:44] sanctification starts are the real now
[54:48] down here we say well that's
[54:49] sanctification that's clean and set
[54:51] aside for service all right and then the
[54:53] Holy Ghost puts you in service now what
[54:55] does it put you in service for is in
[54:57] your soul is all these other things
[55:00] your imagination is now done away with
[55:03] in God's word's been
[55:05] transforming you you're conscious you're
[55:08] not sitting here thinking about how to
[55:09] fix the tractor and how much what's the
[55:11] score of the ball game is and and your
[55:13] memory is what you're thinking about
[55:14] that was great sermon that brother Wayne
[55:16] preached and I thought about this and I
[55:18] got this apart from that that's your
[55:20] memory part that your reasoning is what
[55:22] the Bible says come let us reason
[55:24] together in other words if there's a
[55:25] false Doctrine comes among you you're
[55:27] going to have to reason it out
[55:30] okay you got to reason that thing out
[55:32] you know you can't just say well I
[55:33] accept this because that's what brother
[55:34] Dale said now that don't do you no good
[55:39] I'm not going to get revelation
[55:41] solely on what brother Dale said
[55:44] slowly on what brother Bob said I said
[55:46] solely you understand not by one person
[55:48] I've got to reason it out what I gotta
[55:51] run it through my filter
[55:53] that's why we as a church we run things
[55:55] I was talking to brother Tim cross the
[55:57] other day and he's coming to preach for
[55:58] us in February when I go to Ohio and do
[56:00] that wedding
[56:02] and he was talking about something I
[56:03] said oh don't worry I said If You Preach
[56:05] something wrong I said my sisters will
[56:06] jump on you so don't worry about that
[56:10] sometimes preachers don't like that
[56:11] either
[56:13] a woman
[56:15] reasoning
[56:17] with him
[56:19] but infection now what did the Bible
[56:21] says it's gonna our affection is turned
[56:22] to what things on high our affection is
[56:25] not down here I love is a horrible
[56:29] phrase that we use all the time
[56:31] I love to hunt I love to drink I love
[56:34] the smoke I love the I love to no it
[56:37] ain't love
[56:38] ain't got nothing to do with it that's
[56:40] an affection that comes from that Spirit
[56:44] realm of man
[56:45] right everybody all right we're there
[56:48] but look it says right here it says to
[56:50] obey leave that up to obey what God Said
[56:53] do now where is the throne room the
[56:55] throne room is in that middle part right
[56:57] there
[56:58] that's what I talk about your spiritual
[57:00] Rudder because that Rudder it doesn't
[57:01] matter the rudder don't have to be about
[57:03] this big
[57:04] but it can move a ship that'll hold 2
[57:07] 000 people if that little rotor turns
[57:09] this away guess what that ship's gonna
[57:10] turn to the left
[57:11] every time
[57:13] you take that great big old boat Brother
[57:15] Gary used to have and no Carolina Skiff
[57:18] and you turn that thing like this you
[57:20] know what it's probably just a little
[57:22] flap about that big behind his Motors or
[57:25] his Motors were turning turned that
[57:27] whole boat
[57:29] the motor wasn't turning the boat folks
[57:32] the captain wasn't turning the boat
[57:34] it was the action of the captain that
[57:36] was turning the boat and that little
[57:38] flap or turned the motors to turn that
[57:41] whole boat in the right direction so
[57:43] that's what you and I we went through
[57:44] life and we had no Rudder in our boat we
[57:46] just storm over here blew over here we
[57:48] just blew over this way we blew over
[57:49] this way
[57:51] huh
[57:52] but it was obeying what God Said do is
[57:54] what brought the power
[57:56] I want us to understand this this statue
[57:58] of perfect man brings power not just to
[58:01] an individual I know it's building
[58:02] individuals but it's bringing power to a
[58:04] church
[58:05] to a bride it's bringing her to maturity
[58:08] to where God's not going to have to tell
[58:10] you every time how to dress every time
[58:12] hot wanna come to church every time
[58:14] while this is right while this is wrong
[58:16] it's going to be something inside of you
[58:18] that throne room is full of Truth yeah
[58:22] it is truth
[58:24] so like I said before let it out let
[58:27] that thing seep out from that entered
[58:30] part of you
[58:31] center part of you into the spirit realm
[58:34] and quit denying
[58:37] the word of God you see I don't deny the
[58:39] word of God by the way well no
[58:43] if you don't do what the word says
[58:45] you're denying the word right okay
[58:48] what brought the virtue is obedience to
[58:51] the word of God let's let's get through
[58:54] real quick now I've read this this
[58:56] morning Christ never sent me to build an
[58:58] organization so this is not an
[58:59] organization we're building because you
[59:00] know what that's not an organization
[59:02] that is a person you
[59:05] that is not a person you and your wife
[59:07] that's not a person of you and your kids
[59:09] that's you
[59:11] that's your person that's what you've
[59:13] got to deal with
[59:16] is you
[59:18] so Christ sent me to build individuals
[59:20] to the statue of Jesus Christ that they
[59:22] might be the PowerHouse and Dwelling
[59:25] Place of the Spirit by his word listen
[59:27] God sets the day of Pentecost has ruled
[59:31] the soul of man that takes him
[59:34] and his word
[59:36] because the bride in their soul is God
[59:39] it's not just part of God it is God
[59:41] all right so why have we still got
[59:44] people dying why we still got people
[59:46] that have false Doctrine why we still
[59:48] got well we still have them now but you
[59:50] got the lutherans you got the Westlands
[59:51] they came from Luther and Wesley
[59:54] and they're highly denominated now why
[59:57] they took the part of Luther had that
[1:00:00] was wrong the part of Wesley that was
[1:00:02] wrong and they made a Doctrine
[1:00:05] foreign and it's false
[1:00:10] but if they would have started and tried
[1:00:12] to build individuals
[1:00:14] trying to build individuals because a
[1:00:16] denomination is a group
[1:00:19] I don't want us to be denominational
[1:00:21] message believers
[1:00:23] I wants to be individual message
[1:00:25] Believers the Bible tells us in the book
[1:00:28] of Ephesus that the Ephesian Church
[1:00:30] there was 12 people right
[1:00:33] they couldn't even pay a preacher he'd
[1:00:35] have to work
[1:00:38] but brother Brown said they were the
[1:00:40] most powerful Church of the day because
[1:00:42] they all 12 had the Holy Ghost
[1:00:44] now all 12 were mature because Paul had
[1:00:47] come they had come under Paul's Tudor
[1:00:49] tutoring and teaching and they had what
[1:00:51] they were they were not questioning
[1:00:53] everything Paul said they were not
[1:00:55] questioning everything God said they did
[1:00:57] exactly they had that little nod from
[1:00:58] God they went they went out and I
[1:01:00] believe that from that church in Ephesus
[1:01:03] there were more churches built there was
[1:01:05] more things done there was more gospel
[1:01:07] going out into the world
[1:01:09] and it was the truth it wasn't part
[1:01:10] truth it wasn't Corinthians going out
[1:01:12] there saying well this might be right
[1:01:14] and this might be wrong no irenius
[1:01:16] wouldn't even stay in the same building
[1:01:18] with the guy
[1:01:19] right remember we all read it Bob
[1:01:21] brought it we all read it he said I
[1:01:23] don't even want to be in a bath house
[1:01:24] with Corinthians he said I'm afraid God
[1:01:26] will collapse the building while I'm in
[1:01:29] there that's how wrong but look that's
[1:01:31] how wrong one Doctrine was
[1:01:35] that's how the first church hated that
[1:01:37] one Doctrine
[1:01:39] that Jesus was a light substance of God
[1:01:41] which started
[1:01:43] and went to 300 A.D and they said no he
[1:01:47] is a like substance of God that's what
[1:01:48] we believe so if he's a light substance
[1:01:51] then there's got to be a father there's
[1:01:53] got to be a son and it got to be a holy
[1:01:55] ghost so now therefore there's a trinity
[1:01:57] try try Unity try
[1:02:00] Trinity three of them
[1:02:03] and guess what brother Brown said that
[1:02:05] Doctrine
[1:02:08] came from the pits of hell
[1:02:11] even though they went to nicaea they got
[1:02:14] together they brought the religious
[1:02:16] people of the world brother Ryan said
[1:02:18] prophets came and couldn't do any good
[1:02:19] because they were overwhelmed by the
[1:02:22] power of the devil and he said that
[1:02:24] Doctrine came from the pits of hell it
[1:02:26] did not come from God yet the whole
[1:02:28] world at this moment unless you're a
[1:02:30] Believer are part of a Oneness movement
[1:02:34] so I guess you got a Doctrine to come
[1:02:35] from the pits of hell
[1:02:37] that's my brother I'm hated
[1:02:38] denominations why am I against organized
[1:02:41] religion
[1:02:42] now brother Brian didn't hate the people
[1:02:44] but he hated them
[1:02:45] Doctrine but now remember if you take on
[1:02:48] that Doctrine and don't get out of it
[1:02:53] virtue anyone knows the word virtue
[1:02:55] means see it must we must have it
[1:02:57] because virtue is strength or power
[1:03:00] then we talked about the three pulls
[1:03:02] this morning I tried to say enough to
[1:03:03] where you see because you we talk about
[1:03:05] things like third pull Seven Seals
[1:03:08] people are like why in the world are you
[1:03:10] talking about if they're not part of the
[1:03:11] Bride you know we're not part of a good
[1:03:13] Teaching Ministry then there's a lot of
[1:03:15] things that are absolutely
[1:03:19] it to them it's weird
[1:03:20] what do you mean we gotta be on third
[1:03:22] pool that's why you have to take that
[1:03:23] and break it down to justification
[1:03:25] Saints case at least they can read that
[1:03:27] part in the Bible you can't read about a
[1:03:29] third Paul in the Bible
[1:03:32] you can read about it but you can't see
[1:03:33] where it says here's the first pull
[1:03:35] here's the second pull here's the third
[1:03:36] pull it took a profit to bring that all
[1:03:39] right
[1:03:40] and thank God he came to me I don't know
[1:03:43] if he came to you but thank God he came
[1:03:44] to me
[1:03:46] so the three points was what the outer
[1:03:49] Court
[1:03:51] in the flesh
[1:03:53] because look the the second poem was
[1:03:56] sanctification and that's what we're
[1:03:58] under now in this part not in the inside
[1:04:01] we're already outside we are we're at
[1:04:04] that second realm and going up the
[1:04:06] statue of perfect man our affection
[1:04:08] memory reason conscious and imagination
[1:04:10] has got to be changed
[1:04:14] our souls not our souls already changed
[1:04:17] we're already sitting in Heavenly places
[1:04:19] we're already raptured
[1:04:22] we're already in another dimension
[1:04:26] in your soul if you're born again
[1:04:29] God came into this Dimension to get you
[1:04:34] all right
[1:04:35] so sanctification is what we're talking
[1:04:37] about from now on we're talking about
[1:04:39] sanctification of all of virtue
[1:04:42] knowledge tempers patients all the way
[1:04:44] up to statute of perfect man it's where
[1:04:46] God is cleaning us up to put us in
[1:04:49] service you say well wait well I got the
[1:04:52] Holy Ghost I've got power to brother
[1:04:54] Brown said you've got power
[1:04:56] to create a world
[1:04:59] and go live on it
[1:05:01] he said but it's held by bar
[1:05:04] what is that bar
[1:05:06] it bars us
[1:05:08] that bars my stinking thinking
[1:05:11] because when people when you say that
[1:05:13] when a preacher says that to you that
[1:05:15] you can create a world listen you can
[1:05:17] create a world just like God did
[1:05:21] travel to it like a thought and go live
[1:05:23] on it now how many of you are going I
[1:05:26] believe that 100 percent
[1:05:28] don't raise your hand I'll call you
[1:05:29] something else
[1:05:31] because in your mind and in your
[1:05:33] Humanity you're like no way
[1:05:37] but it's there
[1:05:39] so who's stopping it who's the bar
[1:05:42] we to the bar
[1:05:44] and it starts right there in our realm
[1:05:46] of him I can't imagine that would happen
[1:05:50] right
[1:05:52] that's what we say I can't imagine
[1:05:54] that's going to happen
[1:05:57] my conscience tells me
[1:05:59] foreign
[1:06:07] and and I don't know if I want to love
[1:06:08] to do that or not but my memory tells me
[1:06:10] I can't do it
[1:06:12] because I'm still stuck in this world
[1:06:15] and see then you start
[1:06:17] well now the Bible says he's coming back
[1:06:18] here to get me well when I need to go
[1:06:20] see what I mean why do I need to go
[1:06:22] build you know create a world and go
[1:06:24] live on it when God's here
[1:06:26] see that's the reasoning that we why
[1:06:28] can't we just believe it for what he
[1:06:30] said
[1:06:31] Bible says if you could what
[1:06:34] believe in your heart you can move a
[1:06:35] mountain what's the difference
[1:06:37] what's the difference in moving a
[1:06:38] mountain and making one
[1:06:40] same thing all right so what is it then
[1:06:43] the bar is us it's our thinking it's
[1:06:45] that second realm of our
[1:06:49] being
[1:06:50] all right so the opening of the word is
[1:06:52] that seventh seal that's the son of man
[1:06:54] that's going to what that's going to
[1:06:55] change your human body
[1:06:59] it's going to bring your memory reason
[1:07:01] conscious affection imagination under so
[1:07:04] much of the power of God
[1:07:08] never before
[1:07:10] even Jesus he had to yield to that and
[1:07:14] die
[1:07:16] he yielded to that and died because what
[1:07:19] because of me and you
[1:07:20] not for himself he didn't die for
[1:07:22] himself he died for us I hope don't want
[1:07:25] to surprise you there
[1:07:27] he died for us
[1:07:29] he did that for us didn't have to do it
[1:07:31] but he yielded himself to death died
[1:07:34] brother Brown said played the part of
[1:07:35] death because you know what
[1:07:37] when we passed away we're just playing a
[1:07:39] part of death
[1:07:43] Don't Tell Me Brother Richard Marlon and
[1:07:45] brother Ray and and different ones just
[1:07:47] passed on don't tell me they're dead
[1:07:50] they're alive
[1:07:51] way more alive than we are
[1:07:54] and they're probably one of that group
[1:07:55] of people that says he missed the field
[1:07:57] goal
[1:08:03] we'll have to deal with that when we get
[1:08:05] up
[1:08:06] get up north I'm sure I'll get all kind
[1:08:08] of repercussions of that
[1:08:10] but that's okay I don't care
[1:08:12] but you see what our but see what our
[1:08:14] thinking is though we are programmed
[1:08:17] to die
[1:08:20] we are programmed by Humanity to die
[1:08:25] you need life insurance
[1:08:27] why do I need life insurance because
[1:08:29] you're gonna die
[1:08:31] why do I need to keep going to the
[1:08:33] doctor and now I'm not saying anything
[1:08:34] we go for you need to go for a checkup
[1:08:37] even if you'd feel good you need to go
[1:08:39] for a checkup okay
[1:08:41] but we go we're not going to worry about
[1:08:43] that we feel good you know I'm going to
[1:08:45] trust the Lord and that's okay trust the
[1:08:46] Lord if you want to but he did give us
[1:08:48] doctors
[1:08:49] he did give us nurses he did give us
[1:08:51] medication to take and we thank God for
[1:08:54] that
[1:08:55] all right but we don't lean to that
[1:08:57] understanding
[1:08:59] remember brother Brian preached the
[1:09:00] sermon leaned not into your own
[1:09:02] understanding all right which is in the
[1:09:04] Bible we'll get to that because
[1:09:04] understanding is part of knowledge there
[1:09:07] are several words I was going to read
[1:09:08] them and I'll read them now wise unwise
[1:09:11] no knowledge wisdom Spirit of wisdom
[1:09:15] we're going to try to get to that today
[1:09:16] because there's a spirit comes among the
[1:09:18] Bride of spirit of wisdom
[1:09:20] right to know what's right or wrong to
[1:09:22] get to take the balance watching brother
[1:09:25] George Smith somebody told me the other
[1:09:27] day everywhere brother George Goes and
[1:09:28] preaches I can't remember where he was
[1:09:29] at he's got a little
[1:09:31] um in his coat he keeps a a balance a
[1:09:35] level
[1:09:36] and he takes the level out and he sets
[1:09:38] it right here
[1:09:39] and he said we've got to be level
[1:09:43] one of them brothers I was talking to
[1:09:45] the other day I don't know who it was
[1:09:46] but I'm not saying I think I know who it
[1:09:48] was now he said I want to pick that
[1:09:50] thing up and throw that thing out the
[1:09:52] window
[1:09:52] every time I mean it don't matter what
[1:09:54] he was preaching on he takes that level
[1:09:56] out and he lays it right here he said we
[1:09:58] gotta have a balance which is right
[1:10:01] it's got to be a balance
[1:10:03] we do listen to tapes we do listen to
[1:10:05] The Prophet we haven't quit listening to
[1:10:07] Prophet because we got to fight for
[1:10:08] Ministry but we're not over here to this
[1:10:10] side he said that's all we're going to
[1:10:12] listen to
[1:10:14] and something that you know that we've
[1:10:16] got one man to follow and now I think we
[1:10:18] got two
[1:10:22] brother brandeman Jr
[1:10:28] right tell me where that's in the Bible
[1:10:31] not in the Bible you should have enough
[1:10:34] wisdom to know that a five-fold Ministry
[1:10:36] has got to be five folds to get you out
[1:10:37] of here there's got to be five different
[1:10:40] men how many times have you you
[1:10:41] shouldn't listened to me and you said
[1:10:43] you've listened brother Dale you've
[1:10:44] listened to us and listened to us and
[1:10:45] listen to us it's a refreshing to listen
[1:10:47] to somebody else
[1:10:49] don't say that too quick
[1:10:50] but it is it's refreshing
[1:10:54] to bring one in because it's part of a
[1:10:56] five-fold Ministry all right can't just
[1:10:59] have one it's not just one all the time
[1:11:01] you gotta have a five-fold Ministry
[1:11:04] and it's not just one man fulfilling
[1:11:06] fivefold now that's a little bit
[1:11:08] different
[1:11:09] um
[1:11:11] to me it would be
[1:11:13] it would be
[1:11:15] um just complementary to the word of God
[1:11:17] let me just put it that way for God to
[1:11:19] just say you can't listen but just one
[1:11:20] person and that's it
[1:11:23] got a variety
[1:11:24] brother Wayne will bring something that
[1:11:26] I've been preaching and he'll bring it a
[1:11:27] different way and you'll be going I
[1:11:29] never heard that before and I preached
[1:11:31] 15 sermons on it
[1:11:33] you know why you hadn't heard it the way
[1:11:34] I said it you heard it the way he said
[1:11:37] it or Bob gets up and he starts
[1:11:39] preaching and he preaches my sermon over
[1:11:40] and over again and over again
[1:11:43] glad you're going to Nicaragua
[1:11:46] maybe I'll get some no but see that's
[1:11:48] the way but now
[1:11:49] no way the word
[1:11:51] bringing out a way
[1:11:56] many times brother down you know people
[1:11:57] tell Brothers I never heard you say that
[1:12:00] well I pull you 20 sermons where he said
[1:12:03] it but it's just it's part of a
[1:12:04] five-fold Ministry so what am I saying
[1:12:06] that's in that realm right here I'm
[1:12:09] talking about boring again people are
[1:12:11] going to ask questions
[1:12:13] Born Again people are not gonna get it
[1:12:15] just from one person right
[1:12:17] but to perfect us we've got to have this
[1:12:21] do not worry about this right
[1:12:24] carnal man
[1:12:25] living room outer Court
[1:12:28] don't worry about that guy
[1:12:31] we worry about him too much
[1:12:33] right here's a man we need to worry
[1:12:34] about if you're born again folks
[1:12:37] to me this is to me this is God
[1:12:40] in his fullness everybody with me
[1:12:43] but when we came down and we come
[1:12:45] through the womb of a woman like we
[1:12:47] weren't supposed to when we come through
[1:12:49] the womb of a woman we received a
[1:12:53] contrary spirit
[1:12:56] you with me
[1:12:57] a contrary Spirit which is an adamic
[1:13:00] nature that's attached to that inside
[1:13:02] part of you and you what will happen is
[1:13:04] it'll take over
[1:13:07] and you'll become a sinner
[1:13:09] at the age of accountability but what
[1:13:10] happens at the new birth he burns that
[1:13:13] nature out he doesn't burn you out
[1:13:15] he doesn't annihilate your soul he can't
[1:13:18] acknowledge your soul and give you a new
[1:13:19] one
[1:13:21] that's a Doctrine
[1:13:23] that was real prevalent in the message
[1:13:25] that he'll take one soul out and put
[1:13:27] another one in well brother Brown said
[1:13:29] clearly that you there's no
[1:13:30] transmigration of souls listen when
[1:13:33] you're born you have your soul it stays
[1:13:35] in you until you die
[1:13:37] or until you take a body change it is
[1:13:39] you because it's the real you who's God
[1:13:41] going to judge if he puts another one in
[1:13:43] there
[1:13:44] no he's going to judge that one person
[1:13:47] that soul that you were born with
[1:13:50] that's one if we deal with that though
[1:13:52] and we've been dealing with it for
[1:13:54] probably 50 sermons on you must be born
[1:13:56] again and how to be born again and all
[1:13:58] that well now we're working in a little
[1:14:00] higher order we're in the spirit realm
[1:14:02] the second pull which would be turning
[1:14:05] the hearts of the children to the
[1:14:06] fathers that would be the revelation of
[1:14:09] the Son of God or this statue of a
[1:14:11] perfect man and then the third pull we
[1:14:14] haven't got to now listen I know for a
[1:14:16] fact
[1:14:17] I know for a fact
[1:14:22] that you're probably going to question
[1:14:23] what I'm saying
[1:14:25] and others are going to question but
[1:14:27] everybody says we're in a third pool
[1:14:29] Ministry
[1:14:30] be careful
[1:14:33] we got to get that statue perfect man
[1:14:35] down first
[1:14:37] we're not can't jump all the way up
[1:14:39] there to the top yes we are covered
[1:14:41] under the mystery of the son of man but
[1:14:44] if you don't understand what I'm talking
[1:14:45] about with the Son of God and have these
[1:14:47] virtues working in your life it's no use
[1:14:50] saying that you're this third pool
[1:14:52] person
[1:14:55] think about what you're saying
[1:14:58] we are third pool people we're we're
[1:15:00] it's in other words it's available for
[1:15:02] us to get right right but we've got to
[1:15:05] get the second pull on the second part
[1:15:07] of the ministry of God the Son of God
[1:15:09] which is these virtues working in our
[1:15:12] life just like Peter just like Paul just
[1:15:14] like James just like Mark Luke all the
[1:15:17] different ones right
[1:15:19] if we get that yes absolutely
[1:15:22] but God's not going to come down on a
[1:15:26] body that's not finished
[1:15:28] that's right amen right
[1:15:32] he's not
[1:15:34] and he's not going to come down on a
[1:15:35] body that's not the same as the head
[1:15:38] remember the vulcanization we were
[1:15:40] trying to tell y'all last last Wednesday
[1:15:42] night
[1:15:43] it's rubber to rubber is what vulcanizes
[1:15:46] rubber to rock doesn't vulcanize
[1:15:48] it don't stick
[1:15:50] but if we become him in our second realm
[1:15:53] and and you know if we we're going to
[1:15:55] still have problems but you know what's
[1:15:57] going to happen I believe that those
[1:15:59] problems are going to get less and less
[1:16:02] not less and less in intensity but less
[1:16:05] and less in bothering us
[1:16:10] right brother Bynum said one day death
[1:16:13] will crawl up your sleeve
[1:16:16] and you'll just wipe it right off
[1:16:19] now wow
[1:16:20] now take that for a quote everybody
[1:16:22] wants powerful quotes you think about
[1:16:24] what happened when he said that
[1:16:26] right he said one day death will come up
[1:16:30] your sleeve
[1:16:31] and you'll be able in other words to
[1:16:33] push it back
[1:16:35] and he didn't say be able to go call the
[1:16:37] preacher that caused the Deacon that
[1:16:39] caused the Elder he said you will be
[1:16:41] able to push it back you will be able to
[1:16:44] do the
[1:16:47] no devil not my time
[1:16:52] you believe that then we've got to get
[1:16:56] these second pull the spirit realm the
[1:16:58] the memory reason conscious infection
[1:17:00] imagination we've got to start taking
[1:17:03] that and letting that be the most
[1:17:06] important thing if you're born again in
[1:17:08] your soul listen it's just like a little
[1:17:10] piece of of atomic energy
[1:17:14] in your soul
[1:17:16] what you're doing is you're trying to
[1:17:17] crack the shell to get it out
[1:17:20] so you crack in the Shell to get it out
[1:17:22] to that second realm of memory reason
[1:17:24] conscious inspection imagination like I
[1:17:26] said before don't worry about your your
[1:17:28] flash listen I will promise you I'll be
[1:17:32] 63 in a few days
[1:17:33] Ryan if you hadn't done what you did
[1:17:35] Terrence had been finding somebody else
[1:17:37] to do that openness
[1:17:39] don't start off wrong
[1:17:42] now he said that if it was September so
[1:17:44] y'all just don't just don't bother me
[1:17:46] about that
[1:17:48] but
[1:17:49] I know I'm getting older
[1:17:52] I know it's harder to get out of a car
[1:17:56] to get out of the bed
[1:17:58] but that should never ever hinder your
[1:18:01] spirituality
[1:18:03] just cause I'm getting older I don't
[1:18:06] have to study anymore just cause that
[1:18:08] I'm getting any older I don't have to
[1:18:10] come to church now the Bible didn't say
[1:18:12] that right right
[1:18:15] I'll hurt your feelings your feelings
[1:18:17] ought to be hurt
[1:18:19] so we blame it on old ladies now you
[1:18:21] blame a lot of things on old age all
[1:18:24] right I can't stay up all night you know
[1:18:26] I can't do this I can't do that humanly
[1:18:30] but if if if Joshua and Caleb Caleb was
[1:18:34] 80 something years old
[1:18:36] he was 40 when he went in
[1:18:39] you know went into the Wilderness they
[1:18:41] were in there 40 years he was like 85
[1:18:43] years old he said I he said my strength
[1:18:47] has not abated he said I'm just as
[1:18:49] strong now as I was then what was he
[1:18:51] testified he wanted that mountain
[1:18:55] he wanted that mountain that was his to
[1:18:58] get
[1:18:59] and he never said well I'm 85 I think I
[1:19:02] just want to I want to just go up about
[1:19:03] two feet I'll just no he said give me my
[1:19:07] mountain
[1:19:09] now where are we going to say give me my
[1:19:12] promises
[1:19:13] give me what I'm supposed to have
[1:19:18] at 85 years old
[1:19:20] and it was just a strong why he had a
[1:19:23] will
[1:19:24] he didn't have the Holy Ghost in his
[1:19:26] soul folks
[1:19:28] but he had a promise
[1:19:30] those people in the Old Testament died
[1:19:32] under a promise under a promise that
[1:19:35] Jesus Christ the Messiah was going to
[1:19:38] come and die come through a virgin die
[1:19:41] and take their sins away
[1:19:45] and they move mountains brother Bob's
[1:19:46] Fish and get into Hebrews 11 they did
[1:19:48] all those great things that whole
[1:19:50] chapter
[1:19:51] not one of them had the new birth
[1:19:57] it was just the will of them saying I
[1:20:00] believe that's what's going to happen
[1:20:02] I believe what this Prophet is telling
[1:20:04] me
[1:20:06] of course those prophets got killed by a
[1:20:08] lot of people too
[1:20:09] but they were listened to and they were
[1:20:13] so like Barack you know different ones
[1:20:15] but look at them they all started out
[1:20:17] with I can't do that
[1:20:19] I can't do that
[1:20:22] Gideon was hiding when God said you're a
[1:20:25] mighty man of Valor
[1:20:27] and he's going really
[1:20:31] he said isn't that your land aren't you
[1:20:34] aren't you tired of them people doing
[1:20:37] that to you
[1:20:38] pick up something and just start
[1:20:40] fighting
[1:20:41] you don't have to be trained in Jiu
[1:20:44] Jitsu and all that stuff
[1:20:46] pick up your sword the word of God in
[1:20:48] other words he had an ox goat he picked
[1:20:51] up what he could get
[1:20:54] and you know what he done he got what he
[1:20:57] wanted
[1:20:58] same way with Caleb Caleb didn't count
[1:21:00] how many because supposedly that was the
[1:21:02] son of anak was the ones that was on top
[1:21:04] of that mountain which was the Giants
[1:21:07] God always makes it a little bit harder
[1:21:11] well now let's not cross Jordan when
[1:21:13] it's only about this about this wide
[1:21:16] let's wait till the
[1:21:18] snow melts out of from Judea let's wait
[1:21:21] until it's about two miles wide
[1:21:25] right let's wait till flood season
[1:21:28] God said we're waiting till flood season
[1:21:32] I'm gonna send them across during the
[1:21:34] swelling of Jordan
[1:21:37] so in your worst trials guess what it's
[1:21:39] got to be a blessing if you're a
[1:21:41] Christian today it's got to be a
[1:21:43] blessing your trials will absolutely you
[1:21:45] know who it's for it's not for you it's
[1:21:48] to prove to the devil
[1:21:50] that you can do it in the worst of
[1:21:53] situations the most swelling of your
[1:21:56] life
[1:21:58] he said
[1:22:00] step in that water
[1:22:02] take the priest down there step in that
[1:22:04] water
[1:22:05] as soon as you step in that water I'm
[1:22:07] not going to just make it where you can
[1:22:09] walk across
[1:22:11] I'm gonna move it back
[1:22:14] and you'll have a two mile path you can
[1:22:16] walk right through Jordan
[1:22:18] and as brother Wayne was saying there is
[1:22:21] there is a two piles of stones one of
[1:22:24] them is in the Jordan and when it swells
[1:22:26] you can't see it but when it settles
[1:22:27] back down they go man they couldn't even
[1:22:30] see that
[1:22:31] when they crossed the first time but God
[1:22:33] had to open it up and they could put the
[1:22:35] stones in there and come back together
[1:22:36] what a mighty God we serve we're sister
[1:22:39] um Johnny when we need her
[1:22:42] she called the other day boys you talk
[1:22:44] about somebody talking fast
[1:22:46] if her team would have missed a field
[1:22:47] goal and and yeah anyway
[1:22:51] when sister Johnny calls she talks
[1:22:54] you listen
[1:22:57] and it's real good
[1:22:59] we miss her don't we
[1:23:02] [Applause]
[1:23:05] she's faithful she said I'm watching I'm
[1:23:07] saying second devil
[1:23:11] what a mighty God we serve
[1:23:13] but brother Brown said it'd be these
[1:23:15] divinely revealed mystery truths that
[1:23:16] literally turn the hearts of children to
[1:23:18] the Pentecostal fathers that's going to
[1:23:21] be when the seals open when he started
[1:23:22] in 63 he said my new ministry
[1:23:25] or the son of man now what is the son of
[1:23:28] man the son of man's not dealing with
[1:23:30] your soul
[1:23:33] right
[1:23:37] you quiet
[1:23:39] your soul by this time
[1:23:41] ought to already be redeemed
[1:23:43] because you'll never understand the son
[1:23:45] of man what the son of man is unless you
[1:23:47] got God that son of man in your soul
[1:23:52] so the third pull was what to a special
[1:23:55] group of people
[1:23:57] it's not for you
[1:23:59] on questions and answers it's gone from
[1:24:02] you
[1:24:03] it's not for you to get in other words
[1:24:05] you worry about cleaning this guy up
[1:24:08] right here
[1:24:10] 's what he's saying live a good
[1:24:12] Christian Life you know what he said
[1:24:14] live a good Christian Life do the best
[1:24:17] you can
[1:24:19] in other words though God's going to
[1:24:21] send a power in the church after these
[1:24:23] seals are open to show you that not only
[1:24:26] this guy can be redeemed but you know
[1:24:28] what this guy can be redeemed
[1:24:31] when we take a body change this guy is
[1:24:33] going to be changed and it will be fully
[1:24:36] redeemed
[1:24:37] everybody with me so that hasn't come
[1:24:39] yet that's the chief headstone we're
[1:24:41] under that Ministry but we got to get to
[1:24:43] some God Ministry down first before
[1:24:46] that's why I've tried to back up I was
[1:24:48] going to continue on too into the son of
[1:24:50] man but we've got to get the Son of God
[1:24:52] Ministry down first
[1:24:54] the
[1:24:56] memory reason conscious effects and
[1:24:58] Imagination working in virtue knowledge
[1:25:01] tempers places Godless and brotherly
[1:25:02] kindness remember facing on an ad
[1:25:05] if you're born again you get Faith
[1:25:08] anybody with me all right now look this
[1:25:12] is what brother Brown's explaining when
[1:25:13] we're talking about
[1:25:14] this message your Malachi 4 do two
[1:25:16] things bring back the church to the word
[1:25:19] now what is the messenger of Malachi 4
[1:25:21] to do restore back the original Faith
[1:25:24] the resurrection Faith they've not had
[1:25:27] to have Resurrection Faith now listen
[1:25:28] you're resurrect is sitting in Heavenly
[1:25:30] places but that's where those two guys
[1:25:33] had the doctrine that Paul says the
[1:25:34] resurrection is already over Paul's
[1:25:37] talking about an out-resurrection we're
[1:25:38] in the Resurrection The Resurrection in
[1:25:40] your soul because listen at this very
[1:25:42] moment Paul's body
[1:25:47] oh I wasn't supposed to touch that sorry
[1:25:48] it's in the grave
[1:25:51] sorry Richard
[1:25:53] oh Lord
[1:25:55] but his body's in the grave it's
[1:25:56] probably now that's probably back to
[1:25:58] dust you probably can't even find it
[1:26:00] but that thing still lives
[1:26:03] and this thing right here he's still got
[1:26:05] it too because remember they can
[1:26:07] remember what went on when brother Brown
[1:26:09] went across the current time they
[1:26:11] remember they said you've got to go back
[1:26:15] you don't lose those things
[1:26:19] brother Brown said you got an eye
[1:26:21] he said God's got an eye but it's a
[1:26:23] greater eye but when you go across the
[1:26:24] curtain of time you got an eye but it's
[1:26:27] a greater eye
[1:26:28] amen because the limit what we're
[1:26:30] limited to this
[1:26:32] they're not limited when they go across
[1:26:34] that it doesn't matter they leave their
[1:26:35] body here they leave the limit here
[1:26:38] and when they break over in that other
[1:26:40] dimension man their senses are just
[1:26:41] exploded all right
[1:26:43] they were meant a few words they went
[1:26:46] forth and preached a word talk about
[1:26:48] preaching all night
[1:26:49] now what he'll take the message of
[1:26:51] Pentecost which was not Azusa Street see
[1:26:55] he couldn't depend on Azusa Street
[1:26:56] Pentecost because they were trinitarians
[1:26:59] the original Pentecost was not
[1:27:01] trinitarian
[1:27:03] the Pentecost of 1906 was a denomination
[1:27:06] the Pentecost of the first era or the
[1:27:08] first church age was not a denomination
[1:27:10] so brother Brown wasn't talking about
[1:27:12] because when he would I just it tickles
[1:27:15] me that he's sitting there preaching a
[1:27:17] bunch of Pentecostals and every time he
[1:27:18] talks about the message of Pentecost I
[1:27:20] bet they're like oh yeah and he says I'm
[1:27:23] not talking about y'all
[1:27:25] I'm talking about the original Pentecost
[1:27:27] that's why they hated him that's why the
[1:27:29] Pentecostals still hate him today you
[1:27:31] can say brother Brown's name in the
[1:27:33] Baptist Church and it's not going to
[1:27:34] hurt you do not go to a Pentecostal
[1:27:36] church and say the word William Brown
[1:27:38] or the name William Branham they do not
[1:27:40] like him because he preached so much
[1:27:41] against them
[1:27:44] because they were what he came out of
[1:27:46] they didn't come with him they stayed
[1:27:47] right here and he's telling them he said
[1:27:48] you're dead
[1:27:51] and it wasn't hearsay he was telling
[1:27:53] them sitting in their bench you're dead
[1:27:59] because he'll be rebuking them
[1:28:01] because they didn't keep this same faith
[1:28:04] that was back there at the beginning
[1:28:06] amen now I believe we pretty well
[1:28:08] realize it's going to be Elijah and we
[1:28:10] know that for sure and notice the first
[1:28:12] Elijah was come to turn the hearts of
[1:28:13] the children he
[1:28:15] flipped it around the hearts of the
[1:28:17] fathers to the children that would be
[1:28:18] John the Baptist Baptist see the old
[1:28:20] patriarch fathers the old Orthodox the
[1:28:23] legalist the law he turned it back to
[1:28:25] the faith of the fathers from the faith
[1:28:27] of the fathers to the children in other
[1:28:28] words the new message that Jesus was
[1:28:30] bringing what's the new message you must
[1:28:32] be born again not you must go to the
[1:28:33] temple
[1:28:34] you must be born again not depend on a
[1:28:37] lamb
[1:28:38] lamb lamb all right that's what he was
[1:28:41] teaching that's what he was telling him
[1:28:43] that's why John was turning him that's
[1:28:45] why John didn't really have a Doctrine
[1:28:47] to teach he said behold I'm introducing
[1:28:49] this one is going to teach you
[1:28:51] all right he said I can't even he said I
[1:28:54] wouldn't not even worthy for him to
[1:28:56] loose my shoes
[1:28:58] all right look so now the hearts of the
[1:29:00] children this new message that John was
[1:29:02] preaching of the coming Messiah at hand
[1:29:04] he turned the hearts to this but now
[1:29:06] watch the next time John appears we know
[1:29:08] that's he meant next time
[1:29:11] the spirit of Elijah and John all right
[1:29:14] brother Brown wasn't John all right but
[1:29:16] the spirit of Elijah and John the next
[1:29:18] time John appears he turns the hearts
[1:29:20] with his children back to the faith of
[1:29:23] the Pentecostal fathers that would not
[1:29:24] be 1906 that's way before that would be
[1:29:27] 80 30 33. so it'd be back to the
[1:29:30] original message and you'll know when it
[1:29:33] gets here now
[1:29:37] that's where brother Brown says they
[1:29:38] don't even believe in signs they don't
[1:29:40] believe in that back in his age
[1:29:42] they don't believe in wonders they don't
[1:29:43] believe in speaking in tongues they
[1:29:44] don't believe in this that the other he
[1:29:46] said that's why I go with you
[1:29:47] Pentecostal people because you're as
[1:29:49] close to the truth as they were back
[1:29:50] then
[1:29:51] he said as close he said they weren't
[1:29:53] the truth
[1:29:54] because they would what he said you cut
[1:29:56] your hair every year more he said I
[1:29:57] preach on it you cut it off every year I
[1:29:59] come he said you put on tighter clothes
[1:30:01] you do all these things in other words
[1:30:02] you don't listen to what I'm saying
[1:30:06] you'll know when it gets here it'll be a
[1:30:08] restoration to send that lukewarm
[1:30:10] loudacy in church back to that original
[1:30:13] Faith back Yonder yes sir and he will be
[1:30:16] anointed who this this Elijah that we're
[1:30:18] under
[1:30:19] when this Elijah comes he'll be a
[1:30:21] prophet he'll pull no punches he'll cut
[1:30:23] right and left and then we talk about
[1:30:26] restore Joel says I will restore the
[1:30:29] years that the locusts eat what did the
[1:30:30] locusts eat what the canker and palm War
[1:30:32] what they eat
[1:30:34] they eat the original face
[1:30:37] they eat the original tree that was back
[1:30:40] in what Pentecost
[1:30:42] 80 30 Pentecost 33 Pentecost
[1:30:45] it was eat down and what was it now
[1:30:47] listen God can only work in truth
[1:30:53] he can wake at ignorance but he can only
[1:30:57] work in truth that's why brother Brandon
[1:30:58] would say he'd say if I've told you the
[1:31:01] truth
[1:31:03] let God come and vindicate him
[1:31:05] now listen God's not obligated to
[1:31:08] vindicate anything but truth
[1:31:11] and for him coming on the scene and
[1:31:14] vindicating it it must have been the
[1:31:16] truth
[1:31:18] but you know what that's why they hated
[1:31:20] him too that's why they hated brother
[1:31:21] Brown
[1:31:22] they were saying he was false and he was
[1:31:24] false teaching but all when he got on
[1:31:26] the pulpit and he got the anointing it
[1:31:28] was good it was a true anointing I don't
[1:31:30] understand that
[1:31:31] so I will restore you can go ahead and
[1:31:33] pull the quotes back up I'm finished
[1:31:34] with that right now
[1:31:36] Proverbs 12 talking about a virtuous
[1:31:39] woman is a crown to her husband we
[1:31:40] talked about that we got to get to
[1:31:42] knowledge here just for a minute and
[1:31:43] then we'll
[1:31:44] then we'll close let's go to knowledge
[1:31:46] now we know what virtue is we know the
[1:31:49] virtue is strength that's something we
[1:31:50] have to have but you got to know what
[1:31:52] how to use that strength
[1:31:54] everybody with me I know it's hot in
[1:31:56] here I know y'all taking a night night
[1:31:58] nap
[1:32:01] I just hope my pilot tonight does not
[1:32:04] take a night night now
[1:32:08] even the co-pilot
[1:32:11] see I don't ask God when I get an
[1:32:13] airplane I don't ask him to be co-pilot
[1:32:15] I don't ask God to be a co-pilot in my
[1:32:17] car
[1:32:19] no
[1:32:20] I want him to run the thing
[1:32:22] I want him to drive the airplane I want
[1:32:24] him to drive my car
[1:32:28] it's like that old guy Workforce and
[1:32:31] what was his name t Rick what Rick
[1:32:34] I'll remember Rick
[1:32:37] anyway so he was he was a Christian man
[1:32:39] he was a nominal Christian guy and he
[1:32:41] goes around this curve with some chicken
[1:32:43] on it that we had that we were going to
[1:32:44] deliver somewhere and he hits this barn
[1:32:46] and the Barn's really close to the road
[1:32:48] he hits this barn and I mean it just
[1:32:50] drives two by fours right through the
[1:32:52] cab and right through into the into the
[1:32:54] uh back of the truck that I think it was
[1:32:58] his truck
[1:32:59] but anyway there was a guy standing
[1:33:00] there and Rick was just testifying said
[1:33:02] well if the Lord hadn't been with me I
[1:33:04] would have got killed and if the Lord
[1:33:06] hadn't been with me
[1:33:07] he said that old man looked at him and
[1:33:09] said buddy you keep driving like that
[1:33:11] and the Lord ain't gonna be with you
[1:33:15] that's why I want him to drive I don't
[1:33:18] want to be the co-pilot
[1:33:19] he'd got two before stuck through him
[1:33:23] knowledge what was his name
[1:33:28] Rick
[1:33:30] what
[1:33:31] wait why Rick why
[1:33:33] Slick Rick
[1:33:34] he was a good one
[1:33:36] yeah the old man said you keep driving
[1:33:38] like that but he said Lord ain't gonna
[1:33:39] be riding you much longer
[1:33:41] that's the same way with us that's why I
[1:33:43] want him to drive my vehicle I don't
[1:33:44] want him to be my co-pilot I want him to
[1:33:47] drive my vehicle
[1:33:48] second Peter 1 verse 5 we talk about
[1:33:51] knowledge so this is knowledge starts
[1:33:53] with four letters know
[1:33:57] so it's got to do something with knowing
[1:33:59] or no or know what's going on all right
[1:34:02] so knowledge second Peter 1 verse 5 said
[1:34:05] beside this giving all diligence add to
[1:34:08] your faith virtue and to Virtue
[1:34:11] knowledge now look at this word
[1:34:12] knowledge into Greek
[1:34:15] it's called No Seas
[1:34:17] it's knowledge signifies in general
[1:34:19] intelligence we were just talking about
[1:34:21] that understanding the general knowledge
[1:34:23] of Christian religion the deeper more
[1:34:27] perfect and enlarged knowledge of this
[1:34:30] religion so it's not just grammar school
[1:34:32] knowledge
[1:34:33] everybody with me it's not just grammar
[1:34:35] school knowledge all right
[1:34:37] such as look
[1:34:39] the deeper and more perfect and enlarged
[1:34:42] knowledge of this religion such as
[1:34:44] belonging or belongs to the more
[1:34:46] advanced now that's what we're talking
[1:34:48] about you get a certain form listen when
[1:34:50] you get born again you get knowledge a
[1:34:52] part of knowledge telling you to do what
[1:34:54] the word of God said
[1:34:55] but then you've got to you've got to
[1:34:57] take that higher to where as you listen
[1:34:59] to the word of God you have to decipher
[1:35:02] what's good and what's bad you have to
[1:35:04] take that knowledge and apply it to you
[1:35:08] such as belongs to the more advanced
[1:35:11] especially of things lawful and unlawful
[1:35:14] for Christians because you remember look
[1:35:18] the knowledge when cyrenthius came in
[1:35:21] and he said I believe that's a light
[1:35:23] substance of God because that just can't
[1:35:25] be God
[1:35:26] he cried he hungered he and I'm sure he
[1:35:29] brought all kind of accusations or or
[1:35:32] evidences
[1:35:33] to to prop up what he had
[1:35:36] but remember it was false
[1:35:39] so whatever he used to prop up he used
[1:35:41] it wrong he didn't have the knowledge of
[1:35:44] God to tell him like Irene is that's why
[1:35:47] brother Branham picked irenius and
[1:35:50] didn't pick polycarp
[1:35:52] remember
[1:35:53] he said polycarp was a mighty man he was
[1:35:56] a wonderful guy but he leaned toward
[1:36:00] organized religion is that not what he
[1:36:02] said
[1:36:03] but he said irenia stood there and said
[1:36:05] no that's wrong
[1:36:07] polycarp get away from that and polycarp
[1:36:09] wouldn't get away from it but now I'm
[1:36:11] telling you polycarp is going to make it
[1:36:13] he was that far he was that close to
[1:36:14] being a church-aged messenger
[1:36:16] can we be that close to a body change
[1:36:23] oh when we bring it to now it wasn't bad
[1:36:25] say that about him but when we bring it
[1:36:27] home
[1:36:28] that we could be this much by leaning to
[1:36:30] organization or or doing what you want
[1:36:32] to do
[1:36:35] watch this moral wisdom
[1:36:38] that's another word I stopped at Spirit
[1:36:40] of wisdom the word understanding the
[1:36:42] word known
[1:36:44] the word says look
[1:36:47] we talk about the word new
[1:36:49] Adam knew his wife
[1:36:51] in other words he had knowledge of her
[1:36:53] everybody with me we'll talk about it a
[1:36:55] little bit later but we'll close right
[1:36:56] here in just a second moral wisdom such
[1:36:59] as saying in what right living
[1:37:02] hmm
[1:37:03] Genesis 2 9 now here we go we separate
[1:37:06] them the three of what the tree of in
[1:37:07] the garden and the tree of knowledge now
[1:37:09] look that is a tree of knowledge of Good
[1:37:11] and Evil
[1:37:13] that's not just evil there is some good
[1:37:16] like I said before to get out of all
[1:37:18] this a lot of people are not going to be
[1:37:20] able to chime in today or turn into the
[1:37:22] to the internet and watch Us online
[1:37:24] without somewhat knowledge off of that
[1:37:27] tree and knowledge of Good and Evil
[1:37:30] he's a master at that he lets the devil
[1:37:33] do things and he'll you listen the way
[1:37:36] to drive you to God is for the devil for
[1:37:39] him to turn the devil loose on you
[1:37:41] hello somebody we hate that we don't
[1:37:44] like it but that's exactly God's
[1:37:46] prescription
[1:37:47] if you get to wandering away from God he
[1:37:50] will send the devil on you to drive you
[1:37:53] back
[1:37:55] well I don't know if that happened maybe
[1:37:56] it's just me maybe it's me this whole
[1:37:58] thing
[1:37:59] hmm
[1:38:01] Whom Shall he teach knowledge and Whom
[1:38:03] Shall he make to understand Doctrine
[1:38:04] then that are weaned from the milk drawn
[1:38:07] from the breast now the word knowledge
[1:38:08] out of the dictionary but I like this
[1:38:10] watch this the fact or condition of
[1:38:13] knowing something with familiarity
[1:38:19] is this a strange Doctrine to you
[1:38:23] is this a strange message
[1:38:26] I know when you first get born again if
[1:38:28] our brother and sister comes and gets
[1:38:29] gets born again it's a little strange
[1:38:33] but now it's not strange
[1:38:36] you're strange
[1:38:40] you're thinking strange my thinking is
[1:38:42] strange it's not that the message is
[1:38:43] strange
[1:38:44] it's what look it's the fact of knowing
[1:38:47] something with familiarity gained
[1:38:50] through experience or Association birds
[1:38:54] of a feather
[1:38:56] acquaintance with our understanding of
[1:38:58] science art or a technique
[1:39:01] the fact of can or condition of being
[1:39:04] aware of something when you have
[1:39:06] knowledge of something what you're aware
[1:39:08] of it
[1:39:09] you're aware today whether I'm preaching
[1:39:11] you the truth or not if you're born
[1:39:13] again how many of you have been sitting
[1:39:15] in a in a sermon and a brother say
[1:39:17] something a little bit off or a little
[1:39:19] bit wrong what happens ding
[1:39:22] something goes off right here
[1:39:25] that's knowledge that's your Holy Ghost
[1:39:27] knowledge taking what taking your memory
[1:39:32] and bringing it down to say hey there's
[1:39:34] something wrong with that
[1:39:36] brother Ram talks one time he says it
[1:39:38] doesn't ring true
[1:39:40] remember we talked preached on an
[1:39:41] uncertain sound
[1:39:44] the range of one's information or
[1:39:46] understanding which is
[1:39:48] um example is answer to the best of my
[1:39:51] knowledge
[1:39:52] I watch this right here I like this one
[1:39:55] these circumstance or condition of
[1:39:57] apprehending Truth
[1:40:00] you got to go get it
[1:40:03] when you apprehend a suspect guess what
[1:40:05] you've done you've run down the road or
[1:40:07] you've drove down the road and you've
[1:40:09] apprehended that person in other words
[1:40:11] you have went in their direction and you
[1:40:14] have apprehended so what we're going to
[1:40:16] come into this direction
[1:40:18] to apprehend the word of God you got to
[1:40:20] know where the word of God's at
[1:40:22] the circumstance our condition of
[1:40:24] apprehending what truth or fact through
[1:40:28] reasoning you say the Bible says come
[1:40:30] let us reason together
[1:40:32] right and we'll read that a little bit
[1:40:34] later on when we get into reasoning
[1:40:35] we'll talk about that but brother Brown
[1:40:37] let's
[1:40:38] let's do this and then we'll uh we'll
[1:40:40] close right here and musicians get ready
[1:40:42] to come
[1:40:43] brother I'm saying the statue of perfect
[1:40:44] mass and then thirdly you add knowledge
[1:40:47] knowledge now that don't mean worldly
[1:40:49] knowledge
[1:40:50] because that's foolishness to God
[1:40:52] but knowledge to judge judge what right
[1:40:56] from wrong
[1:40:57] how do you judge it then if you've got
[1:40:59] Christian knowledge with your virtue and
[1:41:02] faith
[1:41:03] you judge whether the word is right or
[1:41:06] wrong
[1:41:07] and if you can lay aside all your Creeds
[1:41:09] and all your unbelief everything that
[1:41:11] you claim you have done then you have
[1:41:14] knowledge to believe that God cannot lie
[1:41:17] let every man's word be alive but mine
[1:41:20] be true see now you're getting knowledge
[1:41:23] that Supreme knowledge
[1:41:26] you don't have to have four degrees in
[1:41:29] some college or something like that to
[1:41:31] have it because all these virtues are
[1:41:33] given to you by God not by school
[1:41:38] to place upon the foundation of your
[1:41:41] faith
[1:41:42] that you might come to the full stature
[1:41:44] of a real living
[1:41:47] man of God why do we why do we come to
[1:41:49] church I and I fail miserably I come
[1:41:54] here to get better
[1:41:56] surprise
[1:41:58] I come here to get better
[1:42:00] I don't come here to get worse I don't
[1:42:02] go to the to the doctor's office or I
[1:42:04] don't go to the hospital to get worse
[1:42:07] I take the prescription
[1:42:09] to get better I come here
[1:42:14] let's read this right here and then
[1:42:15] we'll close musicians come on
[1:42:20] is that your perfect man brother but I'm
[1:42:21] saying now when you get it like that
[1:42:22] then add that to your faith when you get
[1:42:25] true virtue add it to your faith when
[1:42:27] you can walk out here on the street live
[1:42:29] like a Christian act like a Christian be
[1:42:32] a Christian add that to your faith in
[1:42:34] other words strength when you have
[1:42:36] knowledge you say well I don't know
[1:42:38] whether this scripture is just right now
[1:42:40] here is Acts 2 38 I don't know how to go
[1:42:43] about it with acts 28 19. I don't all
[1:42:47] right you don't add nothing because you
[1:42:50] ain't got it yet
[1:42:51] see what are you going to do because you
[1:42:54] don't you haven't got knowledge enough
[1:42:56] to know of God yet that the Bible does
[1:42:59] not contradict itself
[1:43:01] see look leave it alone
[1:43:04] and I put that word but in big letters
[1:43:07] look but
[1:43:09] when you can see that the scripture is
[1:43:11] not contradictory
[1:43:13] when you can see that the scriptures are
[1:43:15] not contradictory
[1:43:17] that you can say that and can see that
[1:43:21] by the revelation of God the whole word
[1:43:23] is wrote in Mysteries look and only the
[1:43:26] knowledge of God can reveal it
[1:43:28] Mass knowledge says can't happen
[1:43:31] man's knowledge that ain't gonna happen
[1:43:33] man's knowledge says I it doesn't matter
[1:43:35] how you go to church and wear whatever
[1:43:36] you want to you can do whatever you want
[1:43:38] to you can live like the world and still
[1:43:40] be a Christian now that's the
[1:43:41] overpowering
[1:43:44] um whatever you want to call it it's
[1:43:46] it's very prevalent in denominations
[1:43:50] because you can't tell them guys from
[1:43:52] the world
[1:43:56] we uh
[1:44:00] well never mind
[1:44:01] foreign
[1:44:02] shoulders with the world every once in a
[1:44:04] while
[1:44:07] ask him say hey man what that tattoo for
[1:44:12] why'd you get that piercing for wow I
[1:44:15] like him I enjoy it I wanted to do it
[1:44:20] now what do we do
[1:44:22] when somebody says hey you want to get a
[1:44:23] tattoo bird John
[1:44:25] no no cause I don't enjoy it don't like
[1:44:28] it don't want it don't think nothing of
[1:44:30] it
[1:44:31] now wait a minute that's too different
[1:44:34] but the prevailing world is that Mom saw
[1:44:37] it last night
[1:44:38] we was at that wedding
[1:44:40] she said I hate people got tattoos
[1:44:42] everywhere
[1:44:43] I started saying mom you probably
[1:44:45] there's some that you can't see that
[1:44:48] yeah anyway but that's that
[1:44:52] you know you can have that the preacher
[1:44:54] can get up and he can go outside and
[1:44:56] smoke a cigarette put some children back
[1:44:57] in his mouth and talk like a sailor but
[1:44:59] he's a preacher let's stand to our feet
[1:45:02] so but only the knowledge of God can
[1:45:05] reveal this
[1:45:07] then when you get inside punctuate every
[1:45:09] word of God with an amen then add that
[1:45:12] to your faith
[1:45:14] are we at that point let's say Lord
[1:45:17] Build Me Up O Lord into this let Christ
[1:45:20] be my head that works through me working
[1:45:23] through me on my Foundation my faith
[1:45:26] that's in him let virtue in all his
[1:45:27] temper is placing Godless brother kind
[1:45:29] of work in Me O Lord is my prayer
[1:45:33] I don't care live or die sink or drown
[1:45:36] denomination or no denomination friend
[1:45:38] or no friend how many of y'all can say
[1:45:41] that or did you get cut off somewhere in
[1:45:42] there somewhere
[1:45:44] I don't care Liberty sink or swim
[1:45:46] denomination no denomination friend or
[1:45:48] no friend let that work in me let Christ
[1:45:51] virtue his knowledge flow out that I
[1:45:53] might be able to teach those for God has
[1:45:56] said in the church Apostles prophets
[1:45:58] teachers pastors and evangelists all for
[1:46:00] the perfecting and bringing all these
[1:46:03] virtues into it for that Perfection of
[1:46:07] the coming of the Son of God each one of
[1:46:09] these stones are immaterial off of that
[1:46:12] one this is material of this he's
[1:46:15] talking about these virtues
[1:46:17] this is material of this each one of
[1:46:20] these virtues belonging to him and
[1:46:22] they're pouring out of him down through
[1:46:24] them
[1:46:26] down through them
[1:46:28] down through them that means us we'll
[1:46:31] talk about the spirit of wisdom when we
[1:46:33] get back because president look Spirit
[1:46:34] of wisdom comes into church to make
[1:46:36] known the church to the church by the
[1:46:38] revelation of the Holy Ghost
[1:46:40] so the spirit of wisdom got to come into
[1:46:41] the church it's not just something it's
[1:46:43] not just we've been message Believers
[1:46:44] for years and years and years and years
[1:46:45] and years and years and years and years
[1:46:46] and years and years
[1:46:48] we got to come to a knowledge that we're
[1:46:50] better than that
[1:46:51] right that we're here for another
[1:46:53] purpose we're not here for a purpose
[1:46:54] just to be in the message and to gather
[1:46:56] together and to bring our our uh you
[1:46:58] know bring our uh ideas
[1:47:02] no
[1:47:04] we come here to see what he's got for us
[1:47:07] to see what God's got for us to see what
[1:47:10] song he wants us to sing to see what
[1:47:13] praise he wants us to do to see what he
[1:47:15] wants to preach where you can many times
[1:47:18] brother Dale said many many times and
[1:47:19] and you can feel it that he'll try to
[1:47:21] get a sermon try to get a sermon and man
[1:47:23] it'd be like this right here
[1:47:25] Aaron amen amen
[1:47:28] be like this right here and then you
[1:47:30] come to church that morning and you got
[1:47:32] five visitors
[1:47:33] well that's why I gotten you those
[1:47:35] visitors were coming and he didn't want
[1:47:36] them to teach on the seal that day
[1:47:38] he wanted to get down a little bit lower
[1:47:40] so that so that they can understand that
[1:47:42] you don't leave people out
[1:47:45] and there's one thing for sure you don't
[1:47:47] sit there and Bash them the whole
[1:47:48] service either we've been to them
[1:47:50] Services before too
[1:47:52] hey ma'am yeah
[1:47:55] when you see a preacher that said I just
[1:47:57] had to hit that long that short-haired
[1:47:59] woman sitting in the front row well you
[1:48:01] know what she probably drove her away
[1:48:02] because that was her first service I
[1:48:04] mean come on people that's where you
[1:48:06] don't have the knowledge of God
[1:48:08] you don't have any wisdom when you do
[1:48:10] that
[1:48:15] let me tell you one thing for sure
[1:48:18] I'm glad you're not God and I'm glad I'm
[1:48:20] not God
[1:48:25] they wouldn't nobody make it
[1:48:27] if we were God
[1:48:31] how many of you came to church with a
[1:48:33] pair of pants on or short hair or
[1:48:35] whatever more
[1:48:37] you didn't get kicked out not in this
[1:48:38] church you didn't you didn't get
[1:48:40] preached on either
[1:48:42] there was a love and a reverence that we
[1:48:45] gave every human being
[1:48:46] has a soul
[1:48:48] and as Louise says There Were Ten
[1:48:50] Thousand worlds Every Soul not just oh
[1:48:52] bless God it's just a bride no every
[1:48:54] soul is worth ten thousand worlds Every
[1:48:57] Soul to God is important
[1:48:59] it's up to you to make it important
[1:49:03] well I well
[1:49:06] get born again
[1:49:08] that's what God wants he just wants us
[1:49:10] to get born again and start living
[1:49:13] this statue of perfect man that's what
[1:49:15] he wants he don't want nothing else
[1:49:19] okay
[1:49:21] he wants you to show the world though
[1:49:24] he wants you to let the world know
[1:49:26] I'm different
[1:49:28] I'm different because you know what
[1:49:30] Jesus Christ was different bro John they
[1:49:32] called Jesus everything but God
[1:49:34] they called him the devil you know why
[1:49:36] they did that because that devil inside
[1:49:37] of him hated him so much hated him so
[1:49:40] much so they called him Bells above the
[1:49:41] devil was calling Jesus build above well
[1:49:45] the devil inside of Caiaphas and all
[1:49:47] them other people did but when he met
[1:49:49] them real demons
[1:49:50] in gadara what's the first thing they
[1:49:53] said
[1:49:54] oh thou Son of God
[1:49:56] why you come here to judge me before my
[1:49:58] time they knew exactly who he was
[1:50:00] because they knew they could see in that
[1:50:02] realm in that Spirit realm they could
[1:50:04] see that that was God
[1:50:06] and they were the devil they had the
[1:50:08] devil in there or they were you know
[1:50:09] part of the devil so that's the way the
[1:50:12] world's got it all messed up when Jesus
[1:50:13] came here nobody liked him
[1:50:17] caused War everywhere but he's the
[1:50:19] Prince of Peace
[1:50:22] he opened up his mouth the Bible says
[1:50:25] but he caused a lot of fuss
[1:50:28] heading to the cross
[1:50:30] right
[1:50:32] sometimes we misunderstand This Man
[1:50:35] Called Jesus
[1:50:37] he is the Prince of Peace because that's
[1:50:39] what we're headed to
[1:50:40] there will be peace listen you won't
[1:50:43] know peace you don't know peace here you
[1:50:45] say well I'm having a little bit of
[1:50:46] Peace well that's a little bit right
[1:50:49] right bro John you got kids
[1:50:52] a little bit a little bit of peace
[1:50:55] but think about a Perpetual piece
[1:50:58] we can't fathom that brother Joe we
[1:51:00] can't do that we can't sit and go oh I
[1:51:02] can know that no you don't know that
[1:51:04] but you know what I'm dependent on God
[1:51:06] if I'll do what he says
[1:51:09] that he'll put that inside of me and
[1:51:11] what's inside of me will take me to
[1:51:13] peace
[1:51:14] it'll take me to the peace that passes
[1:51:16] all understanding wow let's sing a song
[1:51:20] God bless you
[1:51:21] cabinet

[1:53:02] he said the mountain was Holy Ghost God
[1:53:04] was standing on him
[1:53:05] there's not a holy church there's not a
[1:53:07] holy building it's the holy people in
[1:53:09] the building
[1:53:11] that's me and you take that to the world
[1:53:13] that the world is dying they need God
[1:53:17] [Music]
[1:53:19] and I'll promise you today before this
[1:53:21] service started
[1:53:22] [Music]
[1:53:23] if we could see in another dimension
[1:53:27] the Angels marched in that door first
[1:53:29] and they're all along these walls
[1:53:32] because I promise you the devil will
[1:53:34] want to stop this from happening
[1:53:37] but what a protection that we have so I
[1:53:41] don't see it I don't feel it now God
[1:53:43] never told us any of that
[1:53:45] he said believe it
[1:53:47] and I believe that I believe that angels
[1:53:50] are if we can see them
[1:53:52] standing
[1:53:56] on holy grounds
[1:54:05] [Music]
[1:54:07] see there do you know I do
[1:54:11] they're ministering Spirits said to me
[1:54:14] and you
[1:54:17] [Music]
[1:54:23] your heavenly father Lord our brothers
[1:54:26] standing here today Lord with the needs
[1:54:31] [Music]
[1:54:48] foreign
[1:54:52] [Music]
[1:55:14] for we are standing in his presence on
[1:55:22] Holy Ground uh
[1:55:27] well one day you won't have to leave
[1:55:28] this
[1:55:30] we'll have to go home
[1:55:32] praise God there'll never be a Monday
[1:55:37] amen
[1:55:39] the little things that we take for
[1:55:40] granted that we're not going to have to
[1:55:41] worry about when we get over there
[1:55:45] bro Joe you're not gonna have to worry
[1:55:46] about losing your glasses and finding
[1:55:48] them you don't have to worry about your
[1:55:50] car keys losing them or finding them
[1:55:52] you're not going to worry about your
[1:55:53] hair losing it or finding it
[1:55:56] it'll be right there
[1:55:59] but what is one more thing before we go
[1:56:02] there this is a minute part of your life
[1:56:05] if you're a Christian I'm talking about
[1:56:08] just a blip
[1:56:09] on God's radar he's he's brought us down
[1:56:12] here to living human bodies to what to
[1:56:16] show him to the world
[1:56:18] and then we're going to an eternity that
[1:56:20] we can't even fathom
[1:56:22] because when I say a little blip that
[1:56:24] don't really mean a whole lot
[1:56:25] I mean bro John is really like that you
[1:56:28] know we're just down here for a moment
[1:56:30] what 70 80 years that we get to live
[1:56:32] here you know maybe a little bit longer
[1:56:33] so I'm a little bit shorter
[1:56:36] but get him in your soul
[1:56:38] get God in your soul if you get God in
[1:56:41] your soul
[1:56:43] you're just as Eternal as God is
[1:56:45] and then brother Byron could say the
[1:56:48] quote you never had a beginning
[1:56:50] and you never had an end what the real
[1:56:52] you
[1:56:54] the real you the one you that was
[1:56:57] supposed to be here had there not been a
[1:56:59] fall
[1:57:00] and that's your soul because your soul
[1:57:02] is changed back not exchanged but it's
[1:57:04] changed back to that young 18 year old
[1:57:07] well praise God
[1:57:09] all the things God got for us that we
[1:57:11] can't even see in the natural realm but
[1:57:13] if we'll just every once in a while just
[1:57:16] get in the spiritual realm just close
[1:57:17] your eyes or even open your eyes and say
[1:57:19] God show me just a little bit
[1:57:22] just a little bit more I want to know a
[1:57:25] little bit more give me some more
[1:57:27] knowledge have you ever just asked him
[1:57:29] for anything in the Statue of perfect
[1:57:31] man that's what we're talking about
[1:57:33] just ask him say God I'm missing it in
[1:57:36] virtue
[1:57:38] be honest with him I'm missing it in
