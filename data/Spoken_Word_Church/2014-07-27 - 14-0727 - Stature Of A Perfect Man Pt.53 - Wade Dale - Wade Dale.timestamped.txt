[0:00] okay now it is
[0:02] all right we've been standing on the
[0:04] statue of a perfect man
[0:06] and we have we are at brotherly kindness
[0:09] and we stopped last week
[0:11] and i told you that we would try to uh
[0:14] read sister shepherd's dream but we'll
[0:16] do that next sunday all right this
[0:18] sunday i want to kind of we've been in
[0:20] the scriptures we know what
[0:22] we know what the bible says about
[0:23] brotherly kindness now listen we can't
[0:25] get around it you can't jump from
[0:27] brotherly kindness up to love
[0:30] so we've got to go through this
[0:34] something we got to go through
[0:37] if you say you're not then then you know
[0:39] i see you interact
[0:41] because you're not going to make a body
[0:42] change
[0:44] maybe we talk about abram wednesday
[0:46] night abraham
[0:47] abram had a promise abram produced
[0:49] something
[0:50] the church ages produced something this
[0:53] message produces
[0:56] the new birth but it doesn't produce a
[0:58] new new birth
[1:00] it's the same new birthday it was on the
[1:02] day of pentecost it came through luther
[1:03] they came through wesley that came to
[1:05] pentecost amen
[1:06] it's just we have a furthermount on the
[1:08] word god has promised us that we were
[1:10] going to have a
[1:12] child
[1:14] but we were going to have to have that
[1:15] child we've done come down here to the
[1:17] end we've got old i hope you saw what i
[1:19] was talking about wednesday night we're
[1:21] at the old part of the we're at the end
[1:23] we're the oldest
[1:25] we're not the youngest we're the oldest
[1:27] of the ages
[1:29] we're the last one
[1:31] the holy ghost was given on the day of
[1:32] pentecost two thousand years ago we
[1:34] ought to know how it operates after two
[1:36] thousand years but it got eat down
[1:38] through the ages but still there was a
[1:40] promise still there was a son born
[1:44] amen
[1:45] jesus christ was birthed into those
[1:47] people
[1:48] but in the end time we're to birth a man
[1:54] abram had strength
[1:56] sarah didn't
[1:58] but abram was wavering in his faith
[2:01] he had faith but remember when you come
[2:03] up to abraham then you hone it down to
[2:05] where abraham said okay now i know i'm
[2:07] going to have to have it by sarah and
[2:08] god i know one thing's for sure you're
[2:10] going to have to do something because i
[2:12] can't produce
[2:13] and sarah can't either
[2:15] we're to the age now to where
[2:17] all human ability is gone
[2:20] right so that's where god's got to get
[2:22] me in youtube we're all you know i
[2:24] thought well we got to get good enough
[2:26] and we got to get this and we got
[2:29] no it's god god's going to have to do
[2:30] the changing we can't change ourselves
[2:32] right all right so god's going to have
[2:34] to do the changing but we're going to
[2:36] have to
[2:37] we're going to have to come under the
[2:38] plan of god to do that
[2:41] we can't do it on our own so we've got
[2:43] to come under the plan of god and the
[2:45] plan of god is is to have virtue
[2:47] knowledge temperance patience godliness
[2:50] brotherly kindness not to miss one of
[2:53] them
[2:57] right
[2:59] they had the word down through the age
[3:01] sure but they didn't have it like we got
[3:03] it they didn't have a prophet to come
[3:05] and tell them exactly what everything
[3:08] that bible meant
[3:09] and how to put it together right
[3:12] satan had torn apart he attacks a word
[3:14] he attacks the word
[3:16] when he attacked the word what he done
[3:18] was he broke fellowship he pulled
[3:19] everything away from each other
[3:21] now they still had the holy ghost
[3:24] born again under their own age right
[3:27] everybody was but there was no that was
[3:29] under abram abram had a promise abram
[3:31] could produce a son god can produce down
[3:34] through the ages but remember that's not
[3:36] what god's looking at
[3:39] god's looking at somebody to finish this
[3:41] thing amen
[3:42] okay he's not look it's not saying that
[3:44] he's not looking at martin luther no he
[3:46] was as pleased to dwell in martin luther
[3:48] as he is mean you
[3:50] or he's a changing god
[3:52] so he doesn't change that's right all
[3:54] right so he was just as pleased with
[3:55] martin luther just shall live by faith
[3:58] as he is with your
[4:00] just shall live by faith because that's
[4:02] what you got to start at
[4:04] but martin luther didn't have enough a
[4:06] light of the word to take him on up
[4:07] higher
[4:09] so he lived a good christian life
[4:13] died went by the grave now he's waiting
[4:16] all right
[4:17] and i hope he got that wings tonight and
[4:19] ishmael was produced and ishmael was a
[4:20] wild child but look ishmael got promises
[4:24] ishmael was a promised son to that abram
[4:28] apart from
[4:30] but remember god wasn't looking at that
[4:32] because remember abram comes back and
[4:34] says no additional may live before you
[4:37] and god said hey i'm going to give him
[4:38] promise he's going to get promises he's
[4:41] going to be a wild child pentecost was a
[4:43] wild child right pentecost was wild
[4:45] child
[4:46] so he got a wild child out of that but
[4:48] that wasn't the
[4:51] culmination
[4:52] of
[4:53] i'm going to make you abraham
[4:56] a father of many nations
[4:59] you're going to bring a promised child
[5:00] out of your loins
[5:02] but you're not going to do it with a
[5:04] denominational idea
[5:08] which is the bondwoman i didn't get into
[5:10] that wednesday night maybe i'll do part
[5:11] two but the bondwoman was hagar she was
[5:14] the bondwoman and the bible says that
[5:17] that the bondwoman will not be heir with
[5:19] a free woman but now remember she got a
[5:21] promise
[5:23] remember she was kicked out and
[5:25] she was you know she looked like she was
[5:27] gonna starve to death and and and all
[5:29] that and and the angel of the lord lrd
[5:32] capital l r d god came to her
[5:35] and said hey don't worry your son's
[5:37] going to be there
[5:38] that's what down through the ages god
[5:40] said hey luther your people's going to
[5:42] be there you live by the just showing by
[5:44] faith even though you smoked a pipe
[5:47] and drank beer in a pub
[5:49] your group's going to make it
[5:52] your group's not going to die sure they
[5:53] physically die but spiritually they
[5:55] didn't die right
[5:57] but we come to a place to where god in
[5:59] the back part of his mind as the prophet
[6:01] said
[6:02] brought us up to a place to where we're
[6:04] going to have to bring all them out of
[6:05] the ground with the word that we have so
[6:07] there's no way we can do it with a wild
[6:09] child
[6:10] we have to do it with a promised son
[6:13] isaac we have to do it with the one that
[6:15] can produce
[6:17] isn't it ishmael's seed that's coming
[6:19] after history
[6:23] wow
[6:24] ishmael's seed is
[6:26] it's so mingled you can't
[6:30] as far as natural seed no
[6:32] it's all mixed
[6:36] remember this is all in type
[6:39] this is all in type
[6:41] no i didn't i never said ishmael's
[6:43] people my kids will make it it's in a
[6:45] type ishmael is a type of the church
[6:47] agent if i understand that say amen amen
[6:50] i mean really ishmael is the type of the
[6:51] church ages because you go to a certain
[6:53] point they got a promise but they didn't
[6:55] get the promise of the body change
[6:57] no natural ishmael that no there's well
[6:59] yeah there's going to be some that make
[7:00] it because i'm sure there's some of
[7:02] ishmael's descendants in the united
[7:04] states right now
[7:06] sitting in the message of the hour who
[7:08] knows
[7:09] because remember
[7:10] ishmael
[7:12] and isaac
[7:13] physically never fought
[7:16] right
[7:17] but doctrinally they fought
[7:21] everybody understand that isaac had a
[7:23] promise
[7:24] he had rebecca and remember he that was
[7:26] a line promise but ishmael had a line
[7:29] that was promised but there would be a
[7:30] wild child so what i was trying to get
[7:32] you to see
[7:33] we can't throw the baby out with the
[7:34] bath water
[7:36] we can't throw ishmael out the ishmael
[7:38] type the type of ishmael is the type of
[7:41] the church
[7:43] not it not the nominal church i'm
[7:45] talking about the true church because
[7:46] remember he was abram seed
[7:49] everybody got the heat but he wasn't
[7:51] that galatians 3 16.
[7:54] not as two seeds as of many but as the
[7:57] one seed which is christ so so god
[7:59] wasn't even looking really at abraham
[8:01] and isaac down that line because
[8:02] remember christ didn't come from any of
[8:04] that
[8:06] christ didn't come from a natural
[8:08] lineage so you have to look at the
[8:10] spiritual language and that's what we're
[8:11] talking about wednesday night look at
[8:12] the spiritual lineage of of isaac which
[8:15] is
[8:16] i've got a promise i'm going to make it
[8:18] in the rapture
[8:20] but that's not the full promise god gave
[8:23] man put his own ideas in it right
[8:27] but when you come to where god met
[8:29] abraham
[8:32] there's your promise okay right there
[8:35] now that's why i read you that quote at
[8:36] the first word brother branham said
[8:38] every son of the faith and daughter will
[8:40] make this final journey
[8:42] i mean me this journey at the final end
[8:46] not the ishmael and not the abram and
[8:48] not the sarah not the contentious woman
[8:51] this right here this is what god
[8:53] promised you have got to meet
[8:55] melchizedek for yourself
[8:57] and you remember the quote that i read
[8:58] you that now melchizedek is in us
[9:01] not one person
[9:03] so you meet melchizedek every day if you
[9:05] meet born again believers
[9:09] amen you meet melchizedek which is god
[9:12] in human flesh now what are you if
[9:14] you're born again
[9:16] you're god in human flesh
[9:18] okay
[9:19] so that's what you're meeting
[9:21] that's why daddy's
[9:22] tommy we're not
[9:24] i think we're saying we'll well we'll
[9:26] meet him over there no here's where we
[9:29] meet him
[9:30] not in a physical form
[9:34] okay but we meet him in flesh
[9:36] in a physical form called a bride
[9:39] that's why melchizedek could not be
[9:42] the savior but yet what was inside of
[9:44] melchizedek was the savior
[9:46] right right
[9:48] the theophany that was in melchizedek
[9:50] that man that met abraham and looked at
[9:52] him eyeball album was the same one that
[9:54] got on the cross and died for your sins
[9:56] but it was just a different flesh
[9:58] because remember that flesh was created
[10:01] and took out of existence there's no way
[10:03] that we were that way he had to be our
[10:05] brother
[10:07] so melchizedek couldn't die for us
[10:10] but the one that was inside of him is
[10:11] the one that went to the cross to die
[10:13] for us because
[10:14] if he's got to if the redeemer the
[10:17] redeemer had to be
[10:18] somebody that went through the same
[10:20] thing you went through
[10:22] melchizedek never went through being a
[10:24] baby growing up
[10:26] dying on a cross no question it was just
[10:28] spoken in existence spoke out of
[10:30] existence but
[10:31] that man became jesus christ that
[10:33] theophany
[10:35] did one day
[10:36] remember how long it was from abraham to
[10:38] jesus another for 2000 years
[10:41] was born in flesh now
[10:44] he can say i was born like you but not
[10:46] born in sin
[10:48] but in other words i'm coming in type
[10:51] of you and your journey
[10:55] because the melchizedek we meet
[11:00] let me put it this way the milk question
[11:02] we meet
[11:03] is not exactly the same melchizedek
[11:05] abraham met because
[11:08] that milk has it hadn't been in flesh
[11:10] and died yet but in the mind of that man
[11:13] it already happened okay got it yeah
[11:15] because he was slain before the
[11:16] foundation of the world so god in his
[11:18] mind knew the whole plan but he had to
[11:20] come down here to fulfill that plan he
[11:22] couldn't stay god
[11:24] up there when i say up there i don't
[11:26] mean up there it's just right here
[11:28] you understand what i'm saying yes
[11:31] so he had to come here as a baby
[11:34] grow up be like me and you
[11:37] that way we he we can say hey that man
[11:40] was just like us because see if we said
[11:42] well melchizedek is our savior see you
[11:44] can have all kind of people out in the
[11:46] world say well we weren't born like him
[11:47] we didn't have nothing to do without
[11:49] them and see most denominational people
[11:51] don't believe that that was a person
[11:55] they don't they don't believe that's the
[11:56] person that abraham met they believe
[11:58] that's a priesthood
[11:59] because they call it the melchizedek
[12:01] priesthood but i mean the bible says
[12:02] without father without mother without
[12:05] ending of day's beginning of life it was
[12:07] a person
[12:09] but it wasn't something that was born
[12:11] because the bible specifically said
[12:13] without beginning of days or ending of
[12:14] life
[12:16] so that person had to be special
[12:19] but now remember that person became
[12:20] jesus christ they had a beginning
[12:24] bodily at the beginning
[12:25] and to take away the sin curse off of us
[12:28] he had to die
[12:30] and go by the grave and come up
[12:33] and then come back into uni melchizedek
[12:35] could not get into
[12:36] abraham there's no way melchizedek could
[12:39] get into abraham's soul
[12:41] but he was showing them a promise that
[12:43] hey abram i mean abraham
[12:46] your sons
[12:48] because remember i might not be
[12:50] physically the son of abraham
[12:52] but brother branham said abraham was the
[12:54] father of the united states of america i
[12:56] didn't read that quote but i got it in
[12:57] my book
[13:00] because the bible says he's the father
[13:02] of nations
[13:03] so he said abraham is the father of the
[13:05] united states of america now what's he
[13:07] talking about faith
[13:09] he's not talking about literal he's
[13:10] talking about faith
[13:12] he's talking about having faith the
[13:14] faith seed of abraham and it's not two
[13:16] seeds as of many but the one seed which
[13:18] is christ so you look at christ
[13:20] you see a many member body but it's one
[13:22] christ
[13:23] one jesus christ
[13:25] everybody got that
[13:26] so that's what we come to when we come
[13:28] to the final end
[13:30] it's not going to be
[13:32] that we're just going to be
[13:34] have part of the promise
[13:36] no we meet melchizedek and he changes
[13:39] our body
[13:40] that was the that's why brother brown
[13:42] said every son of the faith will make
[13:44] this same journey in the final end in
[13:47] the end time
[13:48] when we end this thing up it will have
[13:50] to be god
[13:52] changing our body from inside out
[13:55] see there's no way now what did what
[13:57] happened with abram abraham
[13:59] god changed his body on the outside
[14:04] got it
[14:05] but he didn't want that
[14:07] i don't want that god wants to dwell in
[14:08] your soul amen
[14:10] all right he wants that's where his
[14:11] children come from and so that's why
[14:13] abraham's not a child of god the bible
[14:15] says abraham's a friend of god
[14:18] the faith seat of abraham they're going
[14:20] to get eternal life
[14:22] but they're not going to get eternal
[14:23] life like you and i give eternal life
[14:25] because once we were lost and then god
[14:28] comes in and cleans our soul and resides
[14:30] with abraham he looked at a promise he
[14:33] looked at the sacrifice and he looked at
[14:36] calvary
[14:38] christ hadn't died yet that's why i said
[14:40] when melchizedek walked down that road
[14:42] to meet abraham you and i were in that
[14:44] man
[14:50] we were in the god of the man
[14:52] yes we were in that man when i say man i
[14:54] don't mean the outside man i mean be man
[14:57] because abraham said my lord he saw one
[15:00] man
[15:02] it was revealed to him that that was
[15:04] almighty god
[15:07] now
[15:08] queen
[15:18] and you just said he couldn't and i
[15:20] understand that he could not give
[15:23] his life for our salvation
[15:26] and is that okay because he didn't come
[15:28] through the womb of the woman that's
[15:29] correct right
[15:31] through the womb of a woman it was
[15:32] corrupted through the womb of the woman
[15:34] he had he cleaned that womb out when he
[15:36] came through now physically he didn't
[15:37] clean it out you understand what i'm
[15:39] saying so we got to go back to the
[15:40] spiritual part
[15:42] am i right
[15:44] we got to go back to the spiritual part
[15:45] he did not clean that woman when he came
[15:47] through as a baby it was a mess just
[15:48] like the rest of us
[15:51] but god in type showed that that was
[15:55] what
[15:56] got us in trouble
[15:59] and that's how we're going to get out of
[16:00] trouble
[16:02] god didn't just that's why i said god
[16:03] doesn't
[16:05] mel kevin that wasn't a kinsmen or
[16:16] melchizedek was not kin to anyone right
[16:20] now jesus christ wasn't kin to anyone
[16:22] either but he came the same way you and
[16:25] i came
[16:26] except for
[16:28] the virgin birth versus the sexual birth
[16:30] that we have but remember
[16:33] final end is the same thing it's a baby
[16:35] being born through a woman
[16:37] the correct way that's correct
[16:39] and see man showing it now by artificial
[16:41] insemination they take all kind of they
[16:43] take
[16:44] you know brother brown he said i love
[16:45] this statement he said he said i can uh
[16:49] he said i he said virgin birth he said
[16:51] that's easy
[16:53] he said a natural birth to me is a
[16:54] mystery
[16:56] millions of seed millions of millions of
[16:58] uh germs and or eggs coming together and
[17:01] how do you get here
[17:02] i have one go over the other one and
[17:04] 650 000 of them die in one lift
[17:08] to get you here
[17:09] to me that selection of the almighty
[17:13] it was real easy honestly it was it was
[17:14] easy for god to say all right here's the
[17:16] german here's some here's the egg here's
[17:18] the german i'm gonna put it in mary that
[17:20] was one and one that was pretty easy but
[17:22] to get me and you here it was a battle
[17:26] it wasn't for god but it was for us
[17:28] but he wasn't a kinsmen
[17:30] there's nowhere it says melchizedek he's
[17:32] a priesthood he's the one that is a
[17:34] priest what does a priest do a priest
[17:36] ministers
[17:38] right what was melchizedek doing he was
[17:40] ministering to abraham
[17:44] and very positive i will visit you
[17:48] so abraham was sitting there soaking
[17:49] this in and going man this guy's going
[17:51] to visit this guy being almighty god
[17:54] to me in abraham's mind that just
[17:56] settled everything and that's what
[17:57] should settle everything for you and i
[17:59] we're not going to meet melchizedek as
[18:01] that one person but we're going to meet
[18:02] him through
[18:04] a five-fold ministry actually first
[18:06] because there's your priesthood
[18:08] there's your fivefold there's your
[18:09] melchizedek priesthood apostles prophets
[18:12] pastors teachers and evangelists there's
[18:13] where you're going to get it from can't
[18:15] get it from anywhere else because it
[18:16] says for the perfecting of the saints
[18:19] all right
[18:21] so we come to a time to where
[18:23] we see then that abraham
[18:26] received the promise or was receiving
[18:28] the promise from melchizedek and then we
[18:31] saw what he'd done to sodom he said well
[18:33] there's my there's my brother's down
[18:34] there can you save them
[18:37] god said if you can find finn you know
[18:38] abraham says you can find 50.
[18:41] he said okay be fine 20. okay
[18:44] you can find 10. okay i won't destroy it
[18:46] if you can find 10 but there was only
[18:47] four
[18:49] and one of them was a mate believer
[18:52] you know lost wife but there was four
[18:54] down there that had to come out
[18:56] so god did protect that many people but
[18:58] he did not protect sodom once they got
[19:00] out
[19:01] sodom was burned
[19:04] but now let's let's go and continue
[19:07] on this journey
[19:10] because if every son of the faith got to
[19:11] do this at the final end then we got to
[19:13] act like abraham did not not some of the
[19:15] things that he did before
[19:17] and about laughing at god and all those
[19:18] things because remember he didn't have
[19:20] the new birth david david the things
[19:22] david did is because he
[19:24] leaned to his natural spirit and not the
[19:26] spirit of god
[19:28] we just read songs where where he
[19:30] actually comes down and speaks in the
[19:31] first person lest i dash my foot against
[19:33] the stone and all those things he was
[19:35] talking about christ
[19:36] but there was david that had his best
[19:38] friend killed committed adultery with
[19:40] his best friend's wife and had a child
[19:42] by which the child passed away
[19:44] but
[19:45] because david didn't have the new birth
[19:48] under the blood of bulls and goats that
[19:49] was covered
[19:52] that was covered
[19:54] and they had a prophet on the scene that
[19:56] made sure that that was covered
[19:58] remember nathan said you will not die
[20:00] you should die
[20:01] that's what nathan says that you you
[20:03] should die
[20:04] thou art the man david called the
[20:06] judgment said thou art the man and
[20:07] nathan said well you're the one who did
[20:09] it but you're not going to die god's
[20:10] going to preserve you because he saw the
[20:12] integrity of david's heart
[20:13] same way with abraham
[20:16] like i said wednesday i don't think
[20:17] abraham was some
[20:19] well look where he come from
[20:21] his father was an idol maker so he
[20:23] really probably didn't even believe in
[20:24] god
[20:25] he believed in gods
[20:28] and goddesses and whatever they had
[20:30] because his daddy was making idols and
[20:31] he was probably in the workshop helping
[20:33] his dad when a man spoke to him
[20:36] just out of the
[20:37] remember was a physical man
[20:40] the lord said to abram get up
[20:43] let's go you know what
[20:45] he got him went
[20:47] and through his journey of life he
[20:48] probably never thought that we'd be
[20:50] talking about him
[20:52] 4 000 years later
[20:55] and paul calling him the father of our
[20:56] faith
[20:59] but
[21:00] remember
[21:02] if you look in that old testament
[21:05] you see abram and abraham
[21:07] even abraham gave his wife away when it
[21:09] was abraham remember tried to
[21:11] all right
[21:13] but if you take paul and come through
[21:15] jesus christ and through the blood of
[21:16] christ you come over here to paul paul
[21:18] said he staggered not at the promise of
[21:20] god
[21:21] through unbelief now we would
[21:24] we would stick him as an unbeliever in
[21:26] certain
[21:27] instances remember he laughed at god got
[21:29] down on the floor laughed physically
[21:31] laughed sarah just left in her heart
[21:36] but remember abram's name had just been
[21:38] changed he was just a baby as far as we
[21:40] call a baby
[21:42] in the statue of a perfect man he didn't
[21:43] have virtue he didn't have knowledge
[21:44] temper patience and all those things he
[21:46] didn't have knowledge because remember
[21:49] we read it wednesday night he fell on
[21:51] his face and laughed right after that he
[21:52] said oh that ishmael may walk before you
[21:55] he's leaning back toward ishmael again
[21:58] he was just a babe in christ just like
[21:59] you and i we make mistakes as a baby in
[22:01] christ but once we get brotherly
[22:02] kindness
[22:04] some of those mistakes need to be gone
[22:05] some of those little baby mistakes that
[22:07] we've been making
[22:09] should be out of here
[22:11] let's read a few of these before we go
[22:15] i know some of you can't see all that
[22:16] but i can't remember how i can't get
[22:18] this part off over here on the side
[22:20] anybody know how to do that
[22:24] bob's not
[22:37] and slide it over toward the
[22:40] side of the paper i'm trying all kinds
[22:41] of stuff
[22:47] anyway
[22:48] most of you can see that
[22:51] i'll read it so you'll know what it says
[22:53] this is statue of a perfect man but when
[22:54] you get down here a genuine born again
[22:56] dove then you don't have nothing it adds
[22:58] to you see comes on up all right coming
[23:01] into perfection now then sixthly let's
[23:04] add the bible said here adding brotherly
[23:06] love brotherly kindness now that's a
[23:08] good one right the sixth seventh all
[23:10] right adding brotherly kindness all
[23:12] right when we get to that brother
[23:13] kindness put yourself in his place
[23:16] on the matter now you say my brother
[23:18] sinned against me peter said
[23:20] shall i forgive him
[23:22] seven times a day jesus told him seventy
[23:25] times seven that's four hundred and
[23:27] ninety
[23:29] seven sevens is 49 490 years
[23:35] brotherly kindness
[23:36] now see if a brother is all out of tune
[23:38] don't be impatient with him you see what
[23:40] i was talking about the other day
[23:42] all these virtues come into play with
[23:44] brotherly kindness
[23:46] watch this
[23:48] somebody said not be kind to him now see
[23:50] there's one impatience so there's
[23:51] patience
[23:52] be kind to him go anyway somebody said
[23:54] not long ago how can you believe these
[23:56] things the way you do and still go to
[23:58] the assemblies of god and the oneness
[23:59] all the rest
[24:00] then put zebra in the kindness see
[24:02] hoping someday look
[24:04] patience with him there's one virtue
[24:07] temperance that's true
[24:09] enduring with it knowledge that's three
[24:11] to understand what he believes remember
[24:12] it's in his heart
[24:13] that's what it is
[24:15] virtue in your cell to let it go out
[24:17] with kindness meekness to him having
[24:19] faith that someday
[24:21] god will bring him in so he's using all
[24:23] the virtues down at the bottom
[24:25] going up that pyramid and they all
[24:27] culminate in brotherly kindness because
[24:28] remember that's the last virtue until we
[24:31] get the love of god which is the
[24:33] headstone all right
[24:35] and listen
[24:36] 99.9
[24:39] of the christians that have ever lived
[24:42] since the day of pentecost has not come
[24:44] to that love
[24:56] the lord jesus and william branham is
[24:58] the only two people on the face of this
[25:00] earth that has ever come to that
[25:02] capstone
[25:03] that we know that we know of the time
[25:06] that we can use for an example let's put
[25:08] it that way that we can use for an
[25:09] example
[25:10] that come to where that capstone came
[25:12] down over that man and god said hear you
[25:16] him so
[25:18] i don't want to be discouraging but
[25:20] that's a pretty bad batting average
[25:22] 0.01
[25:25] but you know what there is a 0.01
[25:31] it says
[25:32] for the perfecting of the saints
[25:35] so there is a way to get there
[25:38] and william branham got it besides being
[25:40] a prophet this is what i believe
[25:42] and you don't have to be a prophet to
[25:44] receive the headstone
[25:46] amen
[25:47] if not then we all got to either be
[25:48] prophets or we're not going to make it
[25:50] that's right so we're not so brother
[25:52] didn't make it because it was a prophet
[25:54] but mom said that prophet that prophetic
[25:57] gift of brother branham was sent here
[26:00] to straighten not the word out the
[26:03] word's always been straight but
[26:04] straighten the people out that had
[26:07] distorted the word
[26:09] okay so that's what that that that uh
[26:12] prophetic gift did
[26:15] sure we know it was signs and wonders
[26:17] but brother brown said that was just the
[26:18] bait on the hook that was just the
[26:20] healing ministries was just the worm
[26:24] right
[26:24] wiggling worm because there's a hook
[26:26] there you want to catch those fish you
[26:28] put that wiggling worm on there well
[26:30] that wiggling worm was signs and wonders
[26:34] not discrediting signs and wonders
[26:36] because that was a great thing since
[26:37] jesus christ they never was a man that
[26:39] produced as many miracles and produced
[26:41] more than jesus did brother brown said
[26:43] one in service he had as many miracles
[26:45] that jesus did
[26:47] so but that wasn't the message
[26:52] that had been ishmael
[26:54] come on that had been that had been the
[26:57] wild child of pentecost from pentecost
[26:59] till now that had been the gift that god
[27:02] had given people
[27:03] he wants us to take a body change that's
[27:05] his that's got if we don't take a body
[27:07] change then this thing keeps going on
[27:09] and on and he can't because this is the
[27:10] last church ages what i'm telling you
[27:12] we've come up to a walk
[27:14] we've come up to a wall there's no you
[27:16] know luther come up to a little wall but
[27:18] he knew he didn't know but god knew
[27:20] there was a wesley standing there to
[27:22] take the message and start a new
[27:25] then there was a pentecostal wall that
[27:27] wesley came up against and went over and
[27:29] went into the pentecostal age well now
[27:31] we're in laodicea there's no other wall
[27:33] we either going to hit the wall and go
[27:35] down or hit the wall and go up
[27:39] so there's our but our promise is that
[27:41] we're going to have that child
[27:43] there's our promise that's why every son
[27:45] of the faith and the final end will take
[27:46] this journey
[27:49] martin luther did not take that journey
[27:51] of meeting melchizedek and being changed
[27:54] and having a child everybody understand
[27:55] that's what i'm talking about
[27:57] wesley did not do that pentecost did not
[27:59] do that they produced a child
[28:02] but it wasn't the promised child
[28:06] from 63 to from let's just put it this
[28:08] way from 1963 after the seals open
[28:10] there's your promised child
[28:13] there's melchizedek
[28:15] meeting you face to face
[28:18] because it was a word not just a person
[28:19] it was a word
[28:21] and and god wanted us to take
[28:24] the body change
[28:26] is he is
[28:27] his
[28:29] thinking for lack of a better word
[28:32] it's his plan to get us back to like an
[28:34] eating perfect like a garden vegan
[28:36] perfect i mean before
[28:38] listen brother brown said this right
[28:40] he'll be sticky to the very end of the
[28:41] change what you're going to have to do
[28:43] is depend on what god's given you inside
[28:45] you
[28:46] no i mean
[28:48] after the body change
[28:50] well after the body yeah when we go i
[28:52] actually want that is exactly what i see
[28:54] what you're saying i'm sorry but yes
[28:57] remember we fell in eden yeah
[29:00] real quick we're gonna have to get out
[29:01] here this was eaten
[29:04] okay
[29:05] this was eaten
[29:07] this was in eve you and i
[29:09] remember
[29:11] all right we fell
[29:14] eden came with us
[29:16] nature
[29:18] nature found man found nature fell with
[29:20] it got it
[29:22] now when we go back
[29:25] man's got to go back to the
[29:28] eating condition first then the world
[29:31] comes with it
[29:32] right so we've got to take a body change
[29:36] to bring eden back up
[29:38] but it's not
[29:40] this
[29:42] this is the same thing because remember
[29:43] redemption is not replacement right
[29:46] the even condition was that you and i
[29:48] were going to be born in a flesh body
[29:50] that was eternal
[29:53] and we were going to live for an
[29:54] eternity no sinners no nothing
[29:56] but when we fell
[29:59] the earth fell with us
[30:00] we're all in a fallen condition
[30:02] the whole world is groaning romans 8
[30:04] waiting on a manifestation of the boy
[30:06] sons of god back up to an eaten
[30:08] condition
[30:10] okay
[30:11] then the world's going to catch up with
[30:12] us in the millennium partly
[30:15] yeah remember partly in the millennium
[30:17] we'll have an eden-like condition not
[30:19] fully
[30:20] we'll have a city that the jews are
[30:22] going to build down here correct
[30:25] jews are going to build that city down
[30:26] here
[30:27] we're going to live in that city that's
[30:29] not the future home
[30:32] devil's still alive
[30:34] his demons are still alive
[30:36] when we get into that future home they
[30:38] ain't going to be no loud demon
[30:40] so we got to go back up let god clean
[30:42] the earth off
[30:44] kill the devil kill the death kill the
[30:46] spirits then we're going to come back
[30:48] into an eating condition just like it
[30:50] was and they're not going to fall that
[30:52] is redemption it is not replacement so
[30:54] we had to have somebody come
[30:56] that didn't fall but that was the type
[30:58] that's like the time absolutely yes
[31:00] that's archetype all right let's go
[31:03] we didn't get done with anything but
[31:04] we'll start again next time
[31:06] lord bless you
[31:31] no because somebody told me the other
[31:33] day
[31:37] if you'll look up those two words word
[31:39] last when sarah laughed and looked up
[31:40] the other word laughs
[31:43] they're two different words
