[16:25] you know he said i like to think i'm
[16:26] good but he said we had to find
[16:28] intervention
[16:32] and i appreciate doctors and surgeons
[16:35] amen who believe in god
[16:38] and uh yes sir the lord the lord knew
[16:41] what was going to happen
[16:43] but he sent the right man for the job
[16:45] that's right amen
[16:47] that's right and uh amen you know even
[16:50] when i had my
[16:51] went through my therapy and
[16:54] everything and when they went to do my
[16:56] permanent impairment rating

[17:01] x-rays she didn't believe i was the same
[17:03] person
[17:04] they said i only lost three percent of
[17:06] use in that arm
[17:08] and most of the days i don't even
[17:10] realize i've missed three percent
[17:13] so i always thank god for that every
[17:15] single day

[17:30] your humerus and
[17:31] you know they never gain use of their
[17:33] arm or very limited use
[17:36] and you know it's just the grace of god
[17:38] that i was
[17:39] that's right got back all the use that i
[17:42] did
[17:43] and uh i thank the lord every day for
[17:45] that so

[19:34] man lord but it's

[20:00] trials and temptations
[20:03] lord as the scripture says song talks
[20:05] about lord we've come through many
[20:06] things but lord
[20:08] lord you led us all the way through some
[20:10] through the water some through the flood
[20:12] some through great trials but lord we've
[20:14] all come through the blood
[20:16] and lord we just so thankful for that
[20:18] blood today lord jesus
[20:20] as we look into the scripture and speak
[20:22] lord what a what a
[20:24] marvelous thing that you've done for us
[20:26] lord we can't praise you enough for it
[20:29] lord let us just have our hearts and our
[20:32] minds on
[20:32] you today lord lord just give us what we
[20:35] have need of give us our daily bread
[20:37] this day in the name of jesus christ we
[20:39] pray amen
[20:41] amen amen isaiah 53 and it says who hath
[20:45] believed our report
[20:47] and to whom is the arm of the lord
[20:49] revealed
[20:50] he said for he shall grow up before him
[20:53] as a tender plant and as a root out of
[20:55] a dry ground he hath no form
[20:58] nor comeliness and when we shall see him
[21:01] there is no beauty that we should desire
[21:03] him
[21:04] he is despised and rejected of men a man
[21:06] of sorrows and acquainted with grief
[21:09] and we hit as it were our faces from him
[21:11] he was despised
[21:13] and we esteemed him not now
[21:16] going to hebrews chapter 9
[21:21] says but christ being come and high
[21:23] priest of good things to come
[21:25] by a greater and more perfect tabernacle
[21:28] not made with hands that is to say
[21:30] not with this building neither by the
[21:32] blood of goats
[21:34] and calves but by his own blood he
[21:36] entered in
[21:37] once into the holy place having obtained
[21:40] eternal redemption for us
[21:42] for if the blood of bulls and goats and
[21:44] the ashes of a heifer sprinkling the
[21:46] unclean sanctified
[21:47] to the purifying of the flesh how much
[21:49] more shall the blood of christ
[21:51] who through the eternal spirit offered
[21:52] himself without spot to god
[21:54] purge your conscience from dead sins to
[21:56] serve the living god
[21:58] and for this cause he is the mediator of
[22:01] the new testament that by
[22:02] means of death for the redemption of the
[22:05] transgressions
[22:06] that we were under the first testament
[22:09] they which
[22:09] are called might receive the promise of
[22:11] eternal inheritance
[22:14] for where a testament is there must of
[22:18] necessity
[22:19] be the death of the testator for a
[22:22] testament
[22:23] is a force after men are dead
[22:26] now i want you i want you to pay
[22:28] attention to that
[22:30] otherwise it is of no strength at all
[22:32] while the testator liveth
[22:37] whereupon neither the first testament
[22:39] was dedicated
[22:40] without blood for when moses had spoken
[22:43] every precept to all the people
[22:45] according to the law he took the blood
[22:47] of calves and of goats
[22:49] with water and scarlet wool and hyssop
[22:51] and sprinkled both the book
[22:53] and all the people saying this is the
[22:56] blood of the testament which god hath
[22:58] enjoined unto you moreover he sprinkled
[23:02] with blood both the tabernacle
[23:05] and all the vessels of the ministry
[23:13] if i don't stir your soul your spoons
[23:15] fell out of your bowl
[23:17] and almost all things are by the law
[23:20] purged with blood
[23:21] and without shedding of blood there is
[23:23] no remission
[23:25] first timothy 6 12 we're just going to
[23:28] read one scripture
[23:29] he says fight the good fight of faith
[23:32] lay hold on eternal life whereunto
[23:34] thou art also called and has professed a
[23:38] good profession
[23:39] before many witnesses amen god bless you
[23:42] this afternoon
[23:43] have your seats
[23:47] and i want to i want to read a little
[23:50] a little story to you
[23:54] and
[24:02] imagine a place
[24:07] where there was a law or a word
[24:12] that declared freedom and liberty to all
[24:16] no bondage to anyone
[24:19] but in this place through unbelief
[24:24] and the hardness of hearts they broke
[24:27] this declaration
[24:30] this law and great turmoil
[24:34] continued which was the condition of the
[24:37] time
[24:38] and so as as it continued said there was
[24:41] two laws during this time came into
[24:44] existence to govern the people
[24:48] but you know what they never could get
[24:49] away from the first law that was written
[24:52] the first law had to be fulfilled
[24:56] and so during all this great turmoil in
[24:59] this time you know
[25:01] they never could get away from the law
[25:02] that was written
[25:04] this this word that was given
[25:09] and because because of this unsettled
[25:13] condition there had to be one that come
[25:16] and settled that question
[25:19] why were some free and well some were
[25:20] not
[25:22] and why were they in the condition what
[25:24] was the land in the condition that it
[25:25] was in
[25:29] and one day there was a man that was
[25:32] born
[25:34] he came and he came from humble
[25:36] beginnings
[25:38] here was a man who was born in one place
[25:40] and he was raised in another place
[25:45] it was said that his mother believed
[25:47] that she had a word from the lord
[25:49] her son would do great things
[25:52] a number of folks saw nothing special in
[25:54] this man
[25:58] as a young man he amazed people
[26:01] with his speech and understanding though
[26:03] he had no formal training
[26:05] or education
[26:10] he was known for making things out of
[26:12] wood
[26:17] one day one day while speaking he
[26:20] declared to the people
[26:23] that a house divided against itself
[26:24] cannot stand
[26:31] but there were a lot of people that
[26:34] wanted to hold on to their old
[26:36] traditions
[26:38] and they just wanted to hold the the old
[26:40] men the old ideas
[26:42] they just wanted to cling to their
[26:43] traditions and stay in a lukewarm
[26:45] condition
[26:46] they didn't want to ruffle anything they
[26:48] just wanted everything try to keep
[26:49] everything
[26:50] as as it was they treated a temporary
[26:54] condition that only
[26:55] pushed the question forward and then the
[26:58] question never was answered
[27:00] and it just kept going forward
[27:04] but this man that was his desire to
[27:07] settle this question
[27:11] he was so hated that they tried to kill
[27:15] him before he ever got started
[27:18] he had to come secretly to a place
[27:21] to fulfill his oath
[27:25] to come to come to the place where he
[27:27] was to fulfill the
[27:29] the law the word that was written of him
[27:33] this man did not act
[27:35] sufficiently to suit some he did not act
[27:38] the way that some people thought
[27:40] they thought his his behavior was rep
[27:42] reprehensible
[27:43] and beneath the station of his life
[27:48] and people saw if this man only knew
[27:50] what was going on how could he act like
[27:52] the way he did
[27:55] but see they didn't understand him
[27:59] this man was identified with the old
[28:00] testament prophets
[28:05] yet they called him a devil
[28:09] and this embodiment of the word that was
[28:13] written of him
[28:15] walked out and declared and made a
[28:17] decree
[28:18] that all who were bound would be set
[28:21] free
[28:23] that was his decree that he made that
[28:26] liberty and freedom would be of those
[28:28] who desired it
[28:33] there came a time in this and this great
[28:36] struggle we see that there was a war
[28:38] taking place
[28:42] and it and it raged on and there was no
[28:45] place for it
[28:46] to come to an end there come a day where
[28:49] they that they
[28:50] they say is the bloodiest day
[28:55] and nobody saw the the great thing that
[28:59] was taking place that day but it was a
[29:01] it was a
[29:02] it was a bloody day but on that
[29:05] from that bloodiest day of that shedding
[29:08] of blood
[29:09] a decree went forth that the enemy's
[29:11] power was broken
[29:15] but you know what it was not realized on
[29:17] that day
[29:20] said the war still raged on but it never
[29:24] changed
[29:26] but after this decree went forth and it
[29:28] came into effect
[29:31] they were people that started to walk in
[29:33] a realm that they had never walked in
[29:35] before
[29:36] that people could walk in in a realm and
[29:39] because they could walk in the law that
[29:41] was written the word that
[29:42] the decree that had went forth they
[29:44] could walk in that in that word and it
[29:46] was totally new to these people
[29:48] but it was it was totally new but you
[29:50] know what they were
[29:51] victorious in what they were doing
[29:53] because and they began
[29:54] begin to walk and they began to decree
[29:57] to everyone
[29:58] of the liberty that they had and you
[30:01] know even during this time there were
[30:02] ups and downs and they were victories
[30:04] and there were defeats
[30:05] but you know what they were still an
[30:07] enemy that was defeated
[30:09] and they still did not see that enemy
[30:11] defeated but you know what after that
[30:13] time
[30:13] as time went on they saw that the enemy
[30:16] came to a total defeat
[30:20] amen and one day after this the men who
[30:24] were in rebellion to this kingdom
[30:26] had to give reverence
[30:29] they had to swear their allegiance
[30:32] to this man and his domain
[30:37] they had to they had to show their their
[30:40] reverence
[30:41] even even though they they were acting
[30:42] in a rebellion and they didn't like what
[30:44] was going on and everything but yet they
[30:46] had they had to a voice
[30:48] who he was and his position
[30:53] now i want to ask y'all a question who
[30:56] do you think i'm speaking of this
[30:57] afternoon
[31:01] does anybody have any idea who
[31:05] very good you probably read that don't
[31:08] read it already
[31:12] abraham lincoln abraham lincoln that's
[31:14] who that was
[31:17] the bloodiest day was the battle of
[31:20] antietam
[31:23] the battle of sharpsburg maryland
[31:29] and the decree that went out from that
[31:31] battle
[31:32] after that battle was lincoln's
[31:35] emancipation proclamation
[31:40] and you know many people think that when
[31:43] you when you read that
[31:45] most people think you're talking of
[31:47] jesus
[31:49] and they think that's the plan of
[31:50] salvation
[31:53] but you know what they don't real you
[31:55] know they don't see
[31:57] what what a great man that lincoln was
[32:01] and you know you kind of know where i'm
[32:04] where i'm going but i i just
[32:05] you know what's so amazing is we had
[32:08] opportunity
[32:09] a few weeks ago we went to springfield
[32:12] and we actually got to go to kentucky
[32:13] see where
[32:14] lincoln was born where he grew up and we
[32:16] got to go springfield
[32:17] see his tomb his home
[32:21] and you know we got to spend a little
[32:23] time looking around and you know
[32:25] most people don't know this my birthday
[32:27] is february 12th i was born on
[32:29] i think it was the 165th i had
[32:32] birthday of lincoln i i was born on
[32:34] abraham lincoln's birthday
[32:36] and he's one of the greatest people to
[32:40] me
[32:42] brother branham said in the influence of
[32:44] another
[32:46] he said but one of the greatest and to
[32:48] my opinion the greatest president that
[32:49] we ever had in this nation
[32:51] was abraham lincoln now not because he
[32:54] was a republican
[32:55] because what he what he was
[33:00] because he was what he was a godly man
[33:02] and he raised up to serve god
[33:04] he said if there's anything that i want
[33:06] to give praise to he said
[33:08] or my life was influenced by was a godly
[33:11] mother who taught me to pray
[33:12] and how to know jesus as my savior
[33:16] you know that was one of the reasons why
[33:19] i read the scripture that i did
[33:20] a man of sorrow and acquainted with
[33:22] grief
[33:24] you know he lost he lost lincoln lost a
[33:26] lot of uh
[33:27] family members he lost sons
[33:31] his sister his mom
[33:35] but you know he had a he had a mom that
[33:38] passed away when he was young but he had
[33:39] a stepmother
[33:41] that came and his stepmother
[33:44] was a godly woman and she said from the
[33:47] first time she met abraham lincoln when
[33:49] he was a child
[33:50] she knew god was going to do great
[33:51] things through him
[33:55] just like jesus you know mary had a had
[33:57] an
[33:58] angel visitation that told her who jesus
[34:01] was and he would do great things
[34:04] but you know we talk about these
[34:08] these things and you you look at
[34:11] the life of people and you know brother
[34:13] branham said that you know
[34:15] abraham lincoln didn't have a didn't
[34:18] have an education
[34:19] but he said he didn't he didn't allow
[34:20] that hold him back you know all the you
[34:23] look at all the things that he done in
[34:24] his
[34:24] that he done in his life all the things
[34:26] that was against him and you know
[34:28] brother man talks about as christians
[34:30] you know we have all these trials and
[34:31] and problems and temptations but are we
[34:34] using that
[34:35] as a crutch are we actually using that
[34:38] to our ability you know because you know
[34:40] we have we have the same goal and we
[34:43] have the same
[34:45] commission to be the best that we can be
[34:49] to to do all that we can for god and you
[34:52] know to see
[34:52] these things and you know to do what god
[34:56] has called us to do god didn't call us
[35:00] to all be the same thing god didn't call
[35:02] us
[35:02] to all do the same thing but he called
[35:04] us to be faithful to what he called us
[35:05] to
[35:07] and you know brother branham speaking
[35:10] here
[35:11] this is from jesus christ the same
[35:13] yesterday day and forever
[35:15] 1955 he said did you ever come to think
[35:18] of it that most men who ever did
[35:20] anything great for the kingdom of god
[35:22] stand alone
[35:23] do you ever think of it you have to
[35:25] stand by yourself jesus stood alone
[35:28] and all down through the ages other men
[35:30] who stood along
[35:31] finney sankey and calvin knox
[35:34] even to abraham lincoln that's right
[35:36] stood alone men who do great things men
[35:38] of vision men of spiritual understanding
[35:41] stand alone and to think that's because
[35:43] that jesus had to stand
[35:45] alone himself
[35:49] so you know
[35:54] you look at the you look at the life of
[35:55] abraham lincoln
[35:58] and you know when you read the things
[36:00] that that he
[36:01] that he went through you know
[36:05] lincoln said one time that he said that
[36:07] uh
[36:08] my best friend is a person who gave me a
[36:12] book
[36:12] that i've never read you know he
[36:15] had an insatiable desire you know
[36:19] his dad wanted him just to work
[36:22] but you know his his stepmom she
[36:24] encouraged him
[36:25] to study and because he had a
[36:29] learn had a desire to learn brother
[36:32] branham said that he had
[36:33] two books that he wrote that he read
[36:34] from he said he had a bible he had the
[36:37] fox's book of markers he said one of the
[36:40] books that he read the most was
[36:42] the other book that he read a lot was
[36:44] the pilgrim's progress
[36:46] you know there's there's people today
[36:49] that read abraham lincoln's
[36:51] writings not for the things that they
[36:53] say but because of the style in which he
[36:55] wrote
[36:56] they said there's not there's not a
[36:58] writer that they can find
[37:00] anywhere that was so influenced by the
[37:02] scripture
[37:03] in his writings that that that
[37:06] they compare him to the to the
[37:08] scriptures to the scribes of the old
[37:09] testament
[37:10] and the in the bible because he was so
[37:12] influenced by the scripture in his
[37:14] writings
[37:15] and you know you know because in lots of
[37:17] times when he began to
[37:19] speak and and uh
[37:22] make speeches and everything there's a
[37:24] lot of things that come out of the
[37:25] scripture
[37:27] to to uh the way he the way he uh
[37:30] answered questions and different things
[37:32] was all scriptural
[37:34] because he was so influenced by the
[37:35] scripture and you know
[37:37] it's so amazing because you know many
[37:39] times people talk about
[37:40] you know stonewall jackson and different
[37:42] ones that brother ram talks about
[37:44] you know being so influential you know
[37:46] jackson was the one that
[37:47] you know he talks about you know he said
[37:49] i i thank god
[37:50] there was a man that wrote to him it was
[37:52] a friend of his and wrote to jackson and
[37:54] he said
[37:54] he said the scripture says pray without
[37:56] ceasing he said i don't understand that
[37:58] he said i find that very hard to do
[38:00] and general jackson said that's very
[38:02] easy for me he said
[38:03] he said i can't drink open as just as
[38:05] natural it is for me to open my mouth to
[38:07] drink a
[38:08] take a sip of water he said it's just
[38:10] that simple to thank god for the water
[38:13] he said everything he said just taking
[38:15] out we
[38:16] take out paper and pen to write a letter
[38:18] he said it's just that simple to pray
[38:21] for the person that you're writing it to
[38:23] and he said when i took a letter that
[38:25] that i go to open he said i pray to god
[38:27] for to prepare me for the contents of it
[38:30] and he said you know he said when he
[38:31] taught in school at the virginia
[38:33] military institute you know he said i
[38:34] pray for
[38:35] the students he said i pray for me that
[38:37] i'll be the right kind of instructor for
[38:39] them
[38:39] because you know he was he was uh
[38:41] molding these young men that had been
[38:43] given to his charge
[38:45] and you know and so everything that that
[38:47] he had to do and you know
[38:48] lincoln was the same type man everything
[38:50] that he done everything that he said had
[38:52] to be influenced by the scripture
[38:54] why and so you know and today you know
[38:56] are we that influenced by the scripture
[38:59] are we so influenced by the scripture by
[39:01] the word that that everything that that
[39:03] you know people will hear us speak are
[39:06] we so worldly
[39:08] are we so are we so relaxed or are we
[39:10] are we so involved
[39:11] are we so you know full of the word that
[39:14] people see that
[39:16] you know because you know that's what we
[39:17] have to have in this hour
[39:19] you know are you are we holding on to
[39:21] the word that much
[39:24] do we do we stand out against the things
[39:26] that are wrong
[39:28] do we speak out against the things that
[39:30] are wrong
[39:34] you know lincoln's lincoln's greatest
[39:38] thing i i guess the thing you know
[39:41] because the
[39:42] the uh
[39:45] thing that that he was so against
[39:49] the thing that he stood against the most
[39:51] that he's so
[39:52] uh known for was slavery
[39:56] and you know when you go to the we were
[39:58] at the the national muse
[39:59] of the presidential museum there in
[40:01] springfield and you know there's a
[40:03] there's a
[40:04] a um a
[40:07] statue it's a saying big
[40:10] stage there that you can look at but it
[40:13] it shows the
[40:14] new orleans and the slave trade
[40:18] and brother brown talks about those
[40:20] women
[40:21] are you know and the husbands being
[40:23] pulled away from each other
[40:24] and and mothers being separated from
[40:26] their children
[40:27] being sold off as animals
[40:31] and you know he talks about you know he
[40:32] saw that in new orleans and it
[40:34] had such had such a profound effect on
[40:36] him and he said you know he said i'm
[40:38] gonna strike
[40:38] i'll hit against that thing he said if
[40:40] it takes my life
[40:43] you know and and he's and he said it it
[40:44] did cost him his life but that was the
[40:46] one thing
[40:47] that he was going to stand against and
[40:50] you know in the beginning
[40:51] of our nation
[40:55] in the beginning of our nation you know
[40:56] when the founding fathers sat down and
[40:58] began to write about our nation
[41:01] you know what they had come out from
[41:03] underneath
[41:04] bondage you know because they didn't
[41:08] have they didn't have the rights and the
[41:09] freedoms why because they were
[41:10] mistreated by
[41:12] great britain and they separated you
[41:14] know we were going
[41:15] and we just decided that we were going
[41:16] to establish a land
[41:18] a nation based on laws
[41:22] not based on mob rule
[41:26] not by just some willy-nilly whoever's
[41:28] in charge
[41:29] fluctuating back and forth
[41:33] but you know what because the founding
[41:35] fathers said that
[41:36] god had given us rights that no man can
[41:40] take away from you
[41:42] they were given that unalienable rights
[41:47] and and our government was established
[41:49] to recognize
[41:50] those the government didn't give you
[41:52] your rights
[41:53] god gave you your rights we were given
[41:56] those freedoms because we were
[41:58] we were creations of god
[42:01] you know when when lincoln went back to
[42:03] that you know as they said
[42:06] you know he was looking back at what the
[42:08] founding fathers had said
[42:12] and you know even in the beginning they
[42:13] they were anti
[42:15] are abolitionists that wanted to get rid
[42:17] of slavery from the beginning
[42:19] but you know what they couldn't they
[42:21] would because
[42:22] they had to hold this country together
[42:24] long enough for it to get started
[42:27] and the only thing they could do is
[42:29] create a compromise
[42:31] and you know what it started a struggle
[42:34] and you know what it always
[42:35] had struggled all the way down through
[42:37] history
[42:39] there's a story that said that lincoln's
[42:41] family moved from kentucky because
[42:43] kentucky allowed slavery
[42:45] and his dad was against slavery
[42:49] and so when he went and then they had
[42:51] some other
[42:53] personal issues that took place some
[42:55] land disputes and different things that
[42:56] happened in kentucky
[42:58] which led them to illinois but you know
[43:01] all these things you know he went back
[43:03] and was looking at at this struggle that
[43:05] took place
[43:06] and you know and it ju and it was as
[43:08] time went on you can't
[43:09] you can't just cover it up you can't
[43:13] just
[43:13] hide it you just can't bury it
[43:16] why because there had to come a time
[43:18] when somebody had to answer this
[43:19] question
[43:21] this question had to be answered because
[43:25] that's the reason when lincoln stood up
[43:26] that day in in 1858 and he made that
[43:29] speech
[43:29] he said a house divided against himself
[43:31] cannot stand
[43:33] he said he said this country cannot be
[43:35] half slave and half free
[43:37] he said because at some point in time he
[43:38] said it's got to be all free
[43:40] or it's got to be all slave you can't
[43:42] have both of them
[43:43] it's not going to continue this way and
[43:46] we see all the way
[43:48] through the scripture we see different
[43:49] ones who who raised up and
[43:52] and you know they they wanted to to
[43:54] continue
[43:55] the president before lincoln was
[43:57] president buchanan
[43:58] buchanan didn't want to take on the the
[44:01] idea of slavery
[44:02] he just wanted it to continue the same
[44:04] way it was we've always had slavery
[44:06] it's always been this way why don't they
[44:08] just continue
[44:10] why because you know what the fabric of
[44:11] this nation wouldn't stand
[44:15] you can't live that way and as it
[44:18] continued to
[44:19] bowl over you know what there had to
[44:21] come a time
[44:22] that there had to come an answer
[44:25] and it so fractured this nation that
[44:28] there was no well
[44:29] you know they had to have somebody come
[44:31] that was that would stand up
[44:32] and either be total slavery or be
[44:35] totally against it
[44:37] there had to be one that would come to
[44:39] answer that question
[44:41] and you know even lincoln was personally
[44:43] against it yeah he said yet
[44:45] if if the government allows it
[44:48] then it has to continue that way but
[44:51] until there's a time in which it can be
[44:53] eliminated
[44:55] but you know what and that's the reason
[44:57] that you know people thought that that
[44:59] he acted too slow or he was
[45:01] he didn't act in a certain way and he
[45:03] went he didn't just go in and just
[45:04] bulldoze everything as as the saiyan is
[45:07] why because he had to go according to
[45:09] the law
[45:13] you know and jesus we're going to
[45:17] you know uh look at look at a few things
[45:19] in in jesus's life you know
[45:21] jesus hung out with a bunch of sinners
[45:24] and publicans and all these are and
[45:25] people's like do you do you know why why
[45:27] is he
[45:28] if he's exactly who he says he is and
[45:30] why does he fellowship with these type
[45:31] people
[45:32] why does he do the things that he does
[45:35] and jesus said you know he said
[45:36] the the physician doesn't go to the
[45:38] people that are well he goes to the
[45:39] people that are sick
[45:41] these are the people that need it they
[45:44] they need this help and he said i'll
[45:46] come to them
[45:47] he said because this is the people that
[45:49] i'm i'm to come to
[45:54] but you see lincoln came to do this one
[45:57] this one thing god raised him up why
[46:00] because
[46:01] it was a time that it had to be answered
[46:05] but you know they hated lincoln so much
[46:07] that they tried to kill him
[46:10] multiple times had
[46:14] on the way from springfield to
[46:15] washington dc for the inauguration
[46:17] they had the presidential train coming
[46:19] from springfield but he got to a certain
[46:22] point
[46:22] before he got to baltimore i believe it
[46:24] was they had to swap
[46:25] trains alan pinkerton
[46:28] who is from the pinkerton agency the
[46:31] great
[46:32] american detective you know he was uh
[46:35] able to um intervene found out about the
[46:39] plot
[46:39] and then he was able to make a way that
[46:42] he came in
[46:43] secretly into washington without anyone
[46:46] knowing he was already in washington
[46:47] before the train ever made it
[46:50] and you know they tried they wanted to
[46:52] kill jesus too
[46:55] you know they wanted to kill jesus and
[46:57] you know he told the disciples one day
[46:59] he said
[47:00] um you know that
[47:03] uh there in uh believe is a mark where
[47:05] he talks about going up to the
[47:07] feast of tabernacles and he said you
[47:09] know he said i'm not going
[47:12] but you know he didn't go the way they
[47:13] said they thought he was but he went
[47:15] secretly
[47:16] to fulfill that oath because you know
[47:18] the one thing is that jesus had to
[47:20] fulfill the law that was written of him
[47:22] amen he with the scripture the word was
[47:24] written of him and he had to fulfill it
[47:27] and so when he went to go fulfill that
[47:29] just like lincoln when he went to go
[47:30] fulfill the oath
[47:32] that was because the law said that he
[47:34] was supposed to go
[47:35] take this oath of his office well he had
[47:38] to go fill the law just like jesus did
[47:40] jesus had to go and do the do the same
[47:42] thing he had to go fulfill
[47:43] the law that was written of him so he
[47:45] had to go because he had to present
[47:47] himself
[47:47] at the feast because that was that was
[47:50] the law of god
[47:52] and so you see all these different
[47:53] things that that he done in his life as
[47:55] he went through
[47:57] you know you know the of the
[48:00] the the humble beginning in his life and
[48:03] you know you he he read they said that
[48:07] lincoln had about
[48:08] if you totaled up the whole time that he
[48:10] went to school it equaled up about less
[48:12] than a year of time that he had spent
[48:13] but you know he learned on his own
[48:16] but you know here's here's a guy to come
[48:17] from the backwoods of kentucky
[48:20] and you know people just thought he was
[48:22] some kind of country bumpkin that didn't
[48:24] know anything
[48:25] but you know what he had read and god
[48:28] had blessed him with it with a skill
[48:31] that when people come even when peter
[48:33] cartwright who was the
[48:34] the methodist preacher the circuit
[48:36] riding preacher that brother ram talked
[48:38] about when they were
[48:39] when he first met lincoln lincoln was
[48:40] just some backwoods kid
[48:42] that uh like in his early 20s
[48:45] that he didn't think anything of until
[48:47] he started talking to lincoln and come
[48:49] to find out lincoln want no pushover
[48:51] he come to find out he met a guy that
[48:53] actually knew something
[48:55] he was astonished at what this man knew
[48:57] they just thought he was some kind of
[48:58] country bumpkin out there splitting wood
[49:00] and
[49:01] hoe and corn but you know what he had
[49:04] actually had
[49:04] had a a gift and actually had studied
[49:07] and people were surprised at what he
[49:09] knew but some people didn't see
[49:11] any greatness in him you know just like
[49:14] jesus you know jesus being 12 years old
[49:16] in the
[49:16] in the temple discussing with the
[49:18] scribes and the
[49:19] and the doctors and the pharisees and
[49:21] all and they were amazed at whose kid is
[49:23] this
[49:27] that he had done all these great things
[49:30] but see all these things you know and
[49:32] most people didn't even know who he was
[49:34] well they didn't know who jesus
[49:35] was
[49:38] he was virtually unknown until he began
[49:41] to speak
[49:43] and you know even when he began to speak
[49:45] people thought you know
[49:47] that he didn't know what he
[49:50] what he believed because you know they
[49:54] had already had all their
[49:55] all the great scribes and all the
[49:57] pharisees and all you know they had all
[49:58] of their traditions of how everything
[50:00] was supposed to be
[50:01] they don't they they believed everything
[50:03] a certain way
[50:05] you know they want to hold on well we're
[50:06] we're abraham's seed and you know we
[50:08] release we've received the law of moses
[50:10] and we've always done
[50:12] it this way but you know what there was
[50:14] one that come to
[50:15] he was he was the fulfillment of that
[50:17] word he was the embodiment of that word
[50:20] when lincoln come into into the
[50:22] presidency he was the embodiment of this
[50:25] word he was the
[50:26] of this country he was the embodiment of
[50:28] this country
[50:30] and he came to to fulfill the word the
[50:33] law
[50:34] the constitution that was written of him
[50:37] and when he came then he came to do this
[50:39] job was to fight this
[50:41] great stain on our country
[50:46] and so we see how this thing went they
[50:49] were
[50:51] fighting you know there were so many
[50:54] that you know they
[50:54] they hated lincoln for for what he stood
[50:57] for
[50:58] he's going to destroy our way of life
[50:59] well you know what this is the la
[51:01] you know because when you look at it
[51:03] this was the needed to be destroyed
[51:06] one because it couldn't continue the
[51:07] same way it was
[51:10] but this but the word that was
[51:12] ultimately written of us
[51:14] by our our law said that all men are
[51:17] created equal amen
[51:20] so you couldn't have some that had it
[51:22] and some that didn't
[51:24] and so when you when you see how this
[51:26] all was to play out then
[51:28] you know we see this great war that took
[51:30] place
[51:33] and you know it wasn't though that
[51:35] lincoln wanted this war but you know
[51:36] it was what took place it's the way that
[51:39] people reacted to it
[51:41] you know he didn't he did not want that
[51:43] but he wanted to bring the people to the
[51:45] place that they needed to come to to see
[51:47] the truth
[51:48] and you know they they come up with this
[51:50] great war and
[51:51] and you know we see how it just
[51:55] it was such a terrible war that took
[51:56] place and in the midst of all this
[51:58] fighting and and everything taking place
[52:00] you know there was there
[52:02] if you look at it there was no way this
[52:04] war was ever going to come out the way
[52:06] it did
[52:07] it took because when that when you saw
[52:09] the the first fighting
[52:10] and the union just taken a beating uh
[52:13] beating
[52:14] and beating and you know all of the
[52:15] generals that lincoln had there was none
[52:17] of them
[52:17] that were worth anything and you know he
[52:19] struggled with all that and he had so
[52:21] many people that was against him
[52:23] and you know brother brahm said he that
[52:24] he was a man that had to stand by
[52:26] himself
[52:26] because nobody else agreed with him you
[52:29] know here he was standing there and he
[52:31] was saying no we need to fight because
[52:33] this is a place we've got to have unity
[52:35] we've got to hold this union together
[52:37] this is this is the job that is required
[52:39] because
[52:40] that's that's what this nation was
[52:42] founded on that we
[52:43] that we all stand together in unity and
[52:46] we and we see how
[52:47] all of this fighting took place and and
[52:49] everybody just ridiculed him
[52:52] and you know and you you find you find
[52:54] black some of the former slaves that
[52:56] have been freed and they were out there
[52:57] you know
[52:58] they identified with him with every old
[53:00] testament prophet
[53:01] they called him the messiah and you know
[53:04] what and all of the southerners called
[53:06] him the devil
[53:07] and they they they ridiculed him and
[53:09] done all kinds of terrible things about
[53:11] him and
[53:12] and you know he lincoln got to the point
[53:14] where he wouldn't even allow
[53:16] a newspaper in the white house he's like
[53:19] because he didn't he didn't need any of
[53:20] that kind of stuff but you know
[53:22] even all the people that he worked with
[53:24] that worked for him
[53:25] none of them would uh agree to what he
[53:28] wrote
[53:30] and he had to stand alone but you know
[53:34] it was because if you're going to do
[53:36] anything great for god you can't have
[53:38] everybody else telling you what needs to
[53:40] be done that's right
[53:41] you don't need to have somebody else
[53:43] putting it in your ears you need to come
[53:45] to a place
[53:45] where you hear from god for yourself
[53:49] and you know it was so amazing because
[53:51] all of this this fighting that was going
[53:53] on and
[53:55] and one day there was a at the the
[53:57] battle of antietam was they call it the
[53:58] bloodiest day
[54:00] we lost more soldiers that day over 22
[54:03] thousand almost 23 000
[54:05] men were killed in one single day the
[54:08] bloodiest day
[54:09] in american history they call it and
[54:11] that one bloodiest day
[54:14] we mcclellan's forces were able to repel
[54:18] these
[54:19] forces they were retreated
[54:22] and because of that
[54:26] see it wasn't it wasn't a great victory
[54:28] that day they couldn't see any great
[54:30] war you know anything anything great
[54:32] took place but you know what they turned
[54:34] the forces of evil back
[54:36] the south yeah and you know because of
[54:39] lincoln saw
[54:40] seeing that take place you know he had
[54:43] already written out the emancipation
[54:44] proclamation
[54:46] before that battle ever started he had
[54:48] already come up with of what he was
[54:49] going to do
[54:52] you know a lot of people make you know
[54:54] they always criticize lincoln for the
[54:55] things that he done but you know the
[54:56] things that he done
[54:57] was you know he was just like everybody
[54:59] else you're growing grace and knowledge
[55:01] just like jesus scripture said he grew
[55:03] in grace and knowledge
[55:05] he didn't have all the answers even
[55:07] later on jesus told the disciples he
[55:09] said i don't know
[55:10] when when the second time coming is
[55:13] going to be i don't know all these
[55:14] different things
[55:14] he hadn't told him he said it's up to
[55:17] the father to know these things
[55:20] but you know he had to grow in grace and
[55:22] knowledge but you know he had one
[55:25] one thing that he held on to was that
[55:27] god would lead him
[55:29] in the direction that he needed to go
[55:32] he had so many great things one of the
[55:34] one of the things that i always liked
[55:35] when they asked him said
[55:37] do you do you know if the lord's on our
[55:38] side or the lord's on their side
[55:41] he said sir i'm not concerned whether
[55:44] the lord's on my side he said
[55:47] i want to be on the lord's side because
[55:50] he said the lord's always right
[55:52] that's right you know that's that you
[55:55] know
[55:55] instead of us trying to trying to bring
[55:57] the word to our idea
[56:00] we need to line up our thoughts to the
[56:02] word
[56:04] we need to see what the word says that
[56:05] we can line up our thoughts and compare
[56:07] it to that
[56:08] to make sure that we're right because
[56:09] you know what the lord's always right we
[56:11] may
[56:11] well you can read the scripture and a
[56:13] lot of people have read the scripture
[56:14] and looked at a lot of different things
[56:16] but you know what it's not it doesn't
[56:17] match up many people
[56:19] have read matthew 28 19 and you know and
[56:22] that's what the bible says but you know
[56:24] that's not right
[56:26] many people have read read the scripture
[56:28] from cover to cover and quote the
[56:29] scripture to you
[56:30] and believe in a trinity
[56:34] so if we're going to read the scripture
[56:36] we need to make sure that we line it up
[56:37] to god's thoughts not our thoughts
[56:39] because you know what our thoughts can
[56:41] be wrong and we're
[56:43] many times we're wrong more than we're
[56:45] right
[56:46] because you know what if we don't take
[56:47] it by what god gives us and shows
[56:49] us what the truth is we have a lot of
[56:52] things wrong
[56:55] we have a lot of questions but
[56:59] you know what when we see this battle
[57:01] that took place and and
[57:03] you know then this decree went out you
[57:06] know there was
[57:06] it wasn't it wasn't a great day it
[57:08] didn't it didn't change the world
[57:10] it didn't it didn't destroy all the
[57:12] powers of the enemy
[57:15] it didn't it didn't it didn't end the
[57:16] war
[57:18] but you know what it started it started
[57:20] on that day
[57:23] when that took place it took that one
[57:27] thing that one battle and when that
[57:30] occurred
[57:31] then you know the south lost
[57:34] recognition throughout the world great
[57:37] britain didn't back them
[57:38] france didn't back them so you know what
[57:41] they were
[57:42] kind of cut off from the world
[57:45] and that you know people thought well
[57:47] you know they still had and you know
[57:48] what they still bought
[57:49] a lot of battles that they lost the
[57:52] union still lost a lot of battles after
[57:54] that
[57:56] and people were still concerned that the
[57:58] union was going to collapse
[58:00] the war had got the war effort had
[58:02] gotten so bad that they didn't think
[58:03] lincoln would get re-elected
[58:07] but you know what everything had already
[58:09] been put in place
[58:11] had already been put in motion for this
[58:13] thing
[58:14] to go the way that it did yeah but
[58:17] people didn't see that
[58:21] and so you know and and then as time
[58:23] went on we saw that
[58:26] they were men that was that raised up
[58:29] that can tell you know that continued
[58:31] the the fight
[58:32] general grant general sherman different
[58:35] ones
[58:36] you know they didn't hold back
[58:40] you know when the when when general
[58:42] grant was put in
[58:43] charge he told him told lincoln he said
[58:46] you know
[58:47] he said it's going to get ugly it's a
[58:49] battle can a
[58:50] contrition you know attrition you know
[58:53] we're just gonna keep on going forward
[58:55] we're not going back for anything
[58:57] and it got ugly it got bad but you know
[59:00] what they had they had a resolve
[59:02] that they were gonna end this thing they
[59:04] were going to crush it
[59:06] when they when they realized that and a
[59:08] lot of people and
[59:09] different different generals you know
[59:11] they were they walked in a realm that
[59:13] they were so afraid of different things
[59:14] and they thought
[59:15] you know they couldn't win and and all
[59:17] you know and they were so ill-prepared
[59:19] for things
[59:20] but you know you you have to you have to
[59:22] be prepared for what you're going to do
[59:25] and if you get to that place where they
[59:27] they got into the you know the different
[59:29] ones that got in
[59:31] in charge you know when they got into
[59:32] battle you know they didn't give up
[59:36] and they and they fought to they got
[59:37] they got the victory
[59:40] and they kept pushing them back and
[59:42] because
[59:43] the south was in the in the position
[59:45] that it was in
[59:46] it began to collapse and you know it
[59:49] took a long time for it to come through
[59:52] and actually get to the place where it
[59:53] needed to be
[59:55] but you know what they after it after
[59:58] this great battle
[1:00:00] and then you see this war continue and
[1:00:02] continue you know what
[1:00:03] they finally had to uh admit
[1:00:06] lee finally had to surrender because you
[1:00:10] know he couldn't he couldn't fight any
[1:00:11] longer
[1:00:12] he had to give up and so you know
[1:00:16] and then all those all those men
[1:00:19] you look back all those men that were
[1:00:21] fighting for you know and then
[1:00:23] a man of mercy and grace
[1:00:28] lincoln could have went through and just
[1:00:30] just massacred so many of them
[1:00:32] he could have hung them shot them done
[1:00:34] so many different things
[1:00:36] but you know what he let me in go back
[1:00:38] with their horses with their weapons
[1:00:42] a lot of men got to go home for the
[1:00:44] simple fact that they swore their
[1:00:45] allegiance to the united states
[1:00:49] and that's all he required of them
[1:00:53] when a lot of you look at a lot of wars
[1:00:55] that's taking place in the in the
[1:00:57] in the world they don't
[1:01:00] you know when you surrender it's on then
[1:01:04] they murder them left and right
[1:01:07] but you know they there were so many
[1:01:09] people that had so much resentment
[1:01:11] and and just anger and
[1:01:15] and everything against these people and
[1:01:17] and lincoln walked out there and said
[1:01:18] listen
[1:01:20] he said y'all need to put all that
[1:01:21] behind you he said because we're
[1:01:23] brothers
[1:01:26] and let me tell you if if you can't see
[1:01:28] if you can't see christ
[1:01:30] in in in in the life of lincoln i don't
[1:01:33] think you can find it
[1:01:34] anybody you know because you know many
[1:01:36] times we find people in the scripture
[1:01:37] and
[1:01:38] we read the scripture but you know
[1:01:39] people say you know who
[1:01:41] who in this world can you see that you
[1:01:43] see the life of jesus christ people want
[1:01:45] to talk to
[1:01:45] want to go to the bible and they want to
[1:01:47] look and say well this is it
[1:01:50] people so who in this world can you
[1:01:52] stand up and and point to somebody
[1:01:54] that's actually had to go through the
[1:01:56] great turmoils and things
[1:01:58] and and live the kind of life that that
[1:02:01] saw that people saw jesus christ in
[1:02:03] their life
[1:02:05] you know and so what we see these kind
[1:02:08] of things in
[1:02:08] and and you know i i just wanted to
[1:02:10] bring out a few things to show you
[1:02:13] uh because it really just it just stirs
[1:02:15] me up inside because
[1:02:17] you know that's what that's what god
[1:02:18] wants us to see in this scripture
[1:02:21] but you know you go back from the
[1:02:23] beginning god
[1:02:24] god give us a word god never wanted us
[1:02:26] to live bound
[1:02:28] brother brother branham said you know
[1:02:29] god never give us a
[1:02:31] a place to be bound he wanted us to be
[1:02:34] free
[1:02:35] god never wanted us to live in sin he
[1:02:38] you know he said there never was a time
[1:02:39] in this world
[1:02:40] he ever wanted to have a funeral service
[1:02:44] there was none of those things sickness
[1:02:47] heartache disease
[1:02:48] all these things were not part of god's
[1:02:50] plan but you know what that was man's
[1:02:52] plan
[1:02:53] that was man that got away from god's
[1:02:56] eternal word
[1:02:58] because the word had declared what was
[1:03:00] what was ours
[1:03:02] but you know a man had to get into his
[1:03:03] own own way and create his own
[1:03:05] own way of of doing things and having
[1:03:08] his own thoughts
[1:03:09] and it created death and it's and it's
[1:03:12] ever been
[1:03:13] ever since then it's just been all this
[1:03:15] contention that has been in this world
[1:03:17] we live in a world that is full of
[1:03:19] contention even from the beginning there
[1:03:21] was an enmity between
[1:03:23] god's seed and the seed of the serpent
[1:03:25] and we see this great enmity between
[1:03:27] the satan and and god this fight this
[1:03:30] conflict that was taking place
[1:03:32] and you know and so satan has always
[1:03:34] thought that he could beat
[1:03:36] god because you know he said i'll be
[1:03:38] like the most high
[1:03:40] you know he was going to be just like
[1:03:41] god he was going to do these great
[1:03:43] things but you know
[1:03:43] he never could be like god he can try as
[1:03:46] much as he can but he can't be like god
[1:03:49] but you know all this fighting is war
[1:03:52] and going on and you know we see
[1:03:54] that there were times in history when
[1:03:56] when when god when people
[1:03:57] the children of israel and different
[1:03:58] ones walk close to god and the next time
[1:04:00] you turn around and they're
[1:04:02] following all the the idols of the world
[1:04:04] and and doing all the things that were
[1:04:06] contrary to the word and they would go
[1:04:08] back and walk with god and try to live
[1:04:10] right and they would go right back
[1:04:12] why because there was no answer there
[1:04:14] was no final answer there was there was
[1:04:16] no way to settle this question
[1:04:19] it had to come to a finality that it had
[1:04:21] to come where it was
[1:04:22] actually answered and you know
[1:04:26] you go back and and and look in the
[1:04:27] scripture when as brother wade was
[1:04:29] speaking
[1:04:30] you know you go back in and you think
[1:04:31] about and and passover and the different
[1:04:34] ones and
[1:04:34] and you think of all of the blood that
[1:04:36] was shed
[1:04:38] all of those lambs that went all of
[1:04:39] those bullocks all of those turtle doves
[1:04:41] every one of them that they brought
[1:04:42] forth
[1:04:43] and all of you know every time that a
[1:04:45] child was born when
[1:04:46] when they came they had they had to
[1:04:47] bring an uh offering a sacrifice to the
[1:04:50] to the priest
[1:04:51] for the for the children and passover
[1:04:54] and all the other different things that
[1:04:55] they had to go through in their life
[1:04:57] every time you
[1:04:57] they had to bring different offerings
[1:04:59] and all of this bloodshed was taking
[1:05:01] place
[1:05:02] all the way through life they were all
[1:05:03] the time bringing their gifts
[1:05:05] but the scripture tells us all of that
[1:05:08] all of that blood that was shed all of
[1:05:10] those animals could not change anybody
[1:05:12] it could not change the fact that that
[1:05:14] they they were still
[1:05:15] had that same desire they were still
[1:05:17] living in the same way
[1:05:18] but you know what there had to come one
[1:05:20] who could bring the answer
[1:05:22] and he said you know and he typed there
[1:05:24] was one that could could answer that
[1:05:26] question
[1:05:27] you know when it when when it came time
[1:05:29] for him to come into the world because
[1:05:31] it had been prophesied that he would
[1:05:33] come
[1:05:33] that he would come and fulfill this word
[1:05:35] well you know what people didn't agree
[1:05:37] with him
[1:05:37] people didn't even recognize him he had
[1:05:39] a terrible name
[1:05:40] and even you know he just come from a
[1:05:42] poor background and nobody ever cared
[1:05:45] anything about him and you know they
[1:05:46] said who is this guy
[1:05:49] and then he said well you know this man
[1:05:50] has a devil
[1:05:52] yeah you know they had all these
[1:05:54] terrible things to say about him but you
[1:05:56] know what
[1:05:56] he had a word and he and he knew what
[1:05:59] god had told him to do
[1:06:00] and he said he said the son can do
[1:06:02] nothing in himself except
[1:06:04] what he sees the father do he said that
[1:06:06] do it the son likewise
[1:06:08] one because he had been given a
[1:06:10] commission to come into this world
[1:06:12] and to answer the sin question one
[1:06:15] because
[1:06:16] god never wanted us to be bound he never
[1:06:18] wanted us to be sick
[1:06:19] he said he wanted us to be happy this he
[1:06:21] said look at the way it was
[1:06:22] in the garden of eden god made a perfect
[1:06:25] place for man to live and he never would
[1:06:27] have to get old and he never would have
[1:06:28] to deal with all these things it was a
[1:06:30] perfect place to live and then god
[1:06:32] wanted us to come in and live in this
[1:06:34] condition
[1:06:35] but you know what god people but man
[1:06:37] adam and eve got away from god's word
[1:06:40] but you know what when he came he made a
[1:06:42] way back but the problem is is people
[1:06:44] don't want to take this word
[1:06:45] and come back you can't get them to see
[1:06:48] because they they have their old
[1:06:50] traditions as
[1:06:52] you know because they're living by the
[1:06:53] old man okay
[1:06:55] like like president buchanan thought
[1:06:57] well you know we're just going to live
[1:06:58] the same way we've always lived well you
[1:07:00] know that's the same old man
[1:07:02] same old traditions people want to live
[1:07:03] by that old same same old way
[1:07:05] the same old thing the devil has told
[1:07:07] them all these years
[1:07:09] and they still want to live the same way
[1:07:10] but he said i've come that you might
[1:07:12] have life
[1:07:13] and have it more abundantly
[1:07:19] see so when he came into this world he
[1:07:22] came to do one thing
[1:07:23] he said i come to seek and save those
[1:07:24] who are lost
[1:07:26] [Music]
[1:07:27] and we've seen all of that bloodshed all
[1:07:29] the way down through the time
[1:07:30] as the scripture said and it couldn't
[1:07:32] change anybody
[1:07:33] but you know what there was one that
[1:07:35] came that he came to shed his blood
[1:07:39] that you might have an eternal
[1:07:41] inheritance
[1:07:47] and you know what he was fought all the
[1:07:50] way through
[1:07:51] scorned and mocked and everything else
[1:07:54] but you know what they didn't deter him
[1:07:56] from from the work that he was supposed
[1:07:58] to do
[1:08:01] you know what he just put all that out
[1:08:02] of his mind
[1:08:06] and you see the and you know speaking of
[1:08:08] lincoln you you see you see
[1:08:10] how he had he had to do the same thing
[1:08:12] he had to go and he had to come to a
[1:08:13] place
[1:08:14] that he had to realize you know it
[1:08:16] didn't matter what anybody else said he
[1:08:17] knew what his commission was
[1:08:21] and god was going to call him to that
[1:08:24] place
[1:08:25] in the right time he had to do what god
[1:08:29] wanted him to do and he came to that
[1:08:31] place
[1:08:31] and jesus came to the place
[1:08:36] one minute people were cheering him
[1:08:40] and praising him and singing his praises
[1:08:44] and everything and the next minute they
[1:08:45] were all calling him the devil and they
[1:08:47] wanted him crucified
[1:08:52] and you know and he and he stood out
[1:08:53] there and he watched these people
[1:08:55] and though you know some of them that
[1:08:56] just loved him so much and the next
[1:08:58] minute they hated him so much
[1:09:01] and he stood up there and said father
[1:09:02] forgive them for they know not what they
[1:09:04] do
[1:09:06] and he went and he went to the cross
[1:09:07] willingly
[1:09:09] nobody had to take his life from him
[1:09:12] he gave his wife his life willingly
[1:09:17] because he he had such a love
[1:09:20] for us and knew what what the end result
[1:09:22] was going to be that he went out and
[1:09:24] and gave his life no one had to take it
[1:09:26] from him
[1:09:28] so when he went on the cross and he said
[1:09:30] and lord into my hands i come in my
[1:09:32] spirit
[1:09:33] when the spirit left him then you know
[1:09:35] he just died
[1:09:36] that that body was gone you know the
[1:09:38] life had left that body is just hanging
[1:09:40] there
[1:09:41] you know they pierced his side but you
[1:09:44] know
[1:09:44] you look at you look at the the
[1:09:46] bloodshed you know when we talk about
[1:09:49] the bloodiest day you know you think
[1:09:52] about
[1:09:53] well we talk about the old testament and
[1:09:55] all that bloodshed
[1:09:56] but you know you think about the the the
[1:09:59] one that came
[1:10:01] who knew no sin who left
[1:10:04] who left the splendor of heaven when he
[1:10:06] left everything
[1:10:07] to come down to be lower than the angels
[1:10:10] when he came to be
[1:10:12] man to walk in in sinful flesh not that
[1:10:15] he was sinful
[1:10:16] but he came to live the same kind of
[1:10:17] journey that you and i walk
[1:10:19] he knows what what sickness is he knows
[1:10:21] what a heartache is
[1:10:23] he knows what all the problems that
[1:10:24] you've been through he knows exactly
[1:10:26] what it is
[1:10:27] so that he can be the high priest that
[1:10:28] can be touched by the feeling of our
[1:10:30] infirmities
[1:10:31] that he knows all these things that he
[1:10:33] walked and you know what he gave up his
[1:10:35] life
[1:10:35] but when he went he took all those
[1:10:36] stripes on his back that he become to
[1:10:39] look like more than just
[1:10:40] just you know unrecognizable as a human
[1:10:44] to look like hamburger meat
[1:10:48] and he'd done all that for you and i
[1:10:51] that we can stand here today and and and
[1:10:54] be
[1:10:56] recipients of eternal life
[1:11:00] that we can be sons and daughters of god
[1:11:04] now if you and i can live just like that
[1:11:06] because he gave everything that he had
[1:11:09] everything about him he gave his all
[1:11:12] because he had one desire
[1:11:16] amen you know you know
[1:11:20] lincoln stood there and you know he he
[1:11:21] said i'm gonna give he said he said if
[1:11:23] it takes my life he said i'm gonna
[1:11:24] do this he actually
[1:11:28] he because nobody there was a lot of
[1:11:29] people in this world that didn't didn't
[1:11:31] even believe black people had a soul
[1:11:35] and yet and yet lincoln said that he
[1:11:37] believed that black men were black
[1:11:38] people were just like him
[1:11:41] they were creations of god that's right
[1:11:45] and and fought and fought the fight that
[1:11:48] he had to fight
[1:11:51] and you know what was so amazing people
[1:11:53] didn't recognize what lincoln had done
[1:11:55] while he was here
[1:11:58] you know jesus came and walked in flesh
[1:12:01] and
[1:12:02] to be this the great sacrifice the
[1:12:06] propitiation that
[1:12:08] for you and i
[1:12:11] and here he was given his life and it
[1:12:14] cost him his life
[1:12:18] this great bloodshed but you know what
[1:12:20] he he left he he left a legacy
[1:12:24] lincoln when you see the kind of life
[1:12:27] you know because
[1:12:28] if you see if you can't see jesus christ
[1:12:31] in that man
[1:12:34] and you know that that's the way we
[1:12:36] ought to wake up every single day
[1:12:38] to have a desire to live like jesus
[1:12:40] christ
[1:12:42] when you when you see how jesus came and
[1:12:45] all the things
[1:12:46] jesus jesus could have had many things
[1:12:48] in this world he could have had a family
[1:12:49] he could have done many things but you
[1:12:51] know he sanctified himself
[1:12:53] that he could be to
[1:12:56] to the job to the to the uh
[1:12:59] commission that he was given to fulfill
[1:13:02] the word
[1:13:04] he sanctified himself to the father that
[1:13:06] he could do the work
[1:13:07] to be a willing vessel for the father
[1:13:11] and come and fulfill all these different
[1:13:14] that
[1:13:14] fulfill all the word that was written of
[1:13:16] him
[1:13:19] that you and i can can be given
[1:13:22] all the great things that we have been
[1:13:24] given in this
[1:13:25] in this life and you know one of the
[1:13:28] things one of the saddest things is
[1:13:30] there were people that don't want to
[1:13:32] live that live below their means
[1:13:34] you know they still live in bondage when
[1:13:36] they know there's a way that's been
[1:13:38] to been made to be free
[1:13:42] you know brother brother branham talks
[1:13:44] about
[1:13:47] he talks about those slaves
[1:13:50] when that decree went out you know he
[1:13:53] said they began to
[1:13:54] they began to hear about this decree and
[1:13:57] when it when it was made known
[1:13:58] he said you know they started climbing
[1:14:00] the mountains he said when the sun came
[1:14:01] up they were waiting for the sun to rise
[1:14:04] on that certain day
[1:14:08] the emancipation proclamation that from
[1:14:10] a second came into effect on january the
[1:14:12] 1st
[1:14:13] 1863 but
[1:14:16] you know they were waiting for that
[1:14:17] thing to come because that was their day
[1:14:20] of freedom
[1:14:21] they had heard the word and they were
[1:14:23] waiting for that day
[1:14:25] and then and brother bram talks about in
[1:14:26] the message letting off the pressure and
[1:14:28] he's talking about
[1:14:29] those slaves when they when they heard
[1:14:30] about that and you know they had been
[1:14:32] waiting for this day and they you know
[1:14:34] talk about all the ones that were
[1:14:35] climbing up the mountain the strongest
[1:14:36] christians
[1:14:37] you know the ones that climbed up that
[1:14:39] mountain to get up on the top
[1:14:40] and he said as soon as they started to
[1:14:42] see the light cracking through when the
[1:14:44] sun was coming up and they started to
[1:14:46] see the light
[1:14:46] he said then they were started screaming
[1:14:48] back down the mountain we're free
[1:14:50] we're free wine because we're seeing the
[1:14:52] sun come up we're seeing the sun rise
[1:14:54] we're seeing the sun and where he's he's
[1:14:56] declaring to us that we are free
[1:14:59] you know and he said you know even
[1:15:00] though even though they were walking in
[1:15:02] darkness they didn't see what other
[1:15:04] people saw but you know what they had
[1:15:05] heard the word and the word were told
[1:15:07] them that they were free
[1:15:08] and you know what in time they began to
[1:15:10] see the light of the word
[1:15:12] that they had the decree that had been
[1:15:14] made and you know
[1:15:15] brothers and sisters we've heard the
[1:15:16] word we've heard the word that we're
[1:15:19] free
[1:15:20] you know what that all that god has he
[1:15:22] poured into us
[1:15:23] he said holy the god was he poured into
[1:15:25] christ and all that he
[1:15:26] all the christ was he poured into the
[1:15:28] bride he poured into the believer
[1:15:31] so the thing is is he said you are heirs
[1:15:33] of god and joint heirs with christ
[1:15:36] and if you and i are the same then you
[1:15:37] know what we don't have to live we don't
[1:15:39] have to take the things that
[1:15:40] that satan puts in front of us we don't
[1:15:42] have to listen to this
[1:15:43] we can we can stand up and claim our
[1:15:45] god-given rights
[1:15:46] one because the son has been has risen
[1:15:49] in our day
[1:15:50] and he said whom the sun has set free is
[1:15:52] free indeed
[1:15:53] and the question is to you do you see
[1:15:55] the sunshine
[1:15:56] do you see the sunlight have you seen
[1:15:59] the sunrise
[1:16:00] is the sun shining in your life are you
[1:16:02] seeing
[1:16:03] the effects of the sun that's right
[1:16:07] are you seeing these things are you
[1:16:08] seeing it what god has given us in this
[1:16:11] day
[1:16:15] i thank god for it yes amen
[1:16:19] i don't want i don't want to live the
[1:16:20] same way that i used to
[1:16:22] i don't want to go back through the old
[1:16:23] things i want i you know because i want
[1:16:25] to walk in newness of life i want
[1:16:27] i want to walk you all that god has
[1:16:29] called me to
[1:16:30] i don't want to live the old way you
[1:16:33] know because
[1:16:34] i tell you what the old man is dead
[1:16:39] i don't want to go out there digging him
[1:16:41] up
[1:16:44] if he's dead and you know what dude it's
[1:16:45] time to put all that behind us we don't
[1:16:48] we don't need to be digging it up we
[1:16:50] don't need to be trying to
[1:16:51] rehash the past one because if it's in
[1:16:53] the blood then as paul said you know he
[1:16:55] said
[1:16:56] putting those things behind us he said
[1:16:58] we need to press toward the mark
[1:16:59] of the high calling why because god has
[1:17:01] called us to a place that we need
[1:17:03] to not worry about the past because if
[1:17:05] it's if it's buried
[1:17:07] if it's in god's sea of forgetfulness
[1:17:09] then we don't need to be trying to worry
[1:17:10] about it anymore
[1:17:12] people so worried about things that
[1:17:14] happen in the past you know you need to
[1:17:16] not worry about that anymore why because
[1:17:18] god has called us
[1:17:19] to a higher place god has called us to
[1:17:21] greater things
[1:17:22] and we need to be climbing that mountain
[1:17:24] because if you're in darkness
[1:17:26] and you can't see the light very well
[1:17:28] then there's a mountain to climb on top
[1:17:29] of
[1:17:30] and see the sunshine god has called we
[1:17:33] need to go and see where we can see what
[1:17:34] what god has given us where is this
[1:17:37] light is shining on the word
[1:17:38] to show us who we are that god has
[1:17:41] called us to a place that you know
[1:17:43] we have been commissioned we've been
[1:17:46] called
[1:17:46] we have been given the word right
[1:17:50] for a body change
[1:17:57] you know other people desired to see our
[1:18:00] day
[1:18:03] and god has called us to a place
[1:18:09] that we can see the things that god has
[1:18:12] he's always wanted this
[1:18:13] to be to show these things he always
[1:18:16] wanted these things
[1:18:18] this was god's mystery secret the
[1:18:22] brother ram said
[1:18:22] in christ the mystery
[1:18:26] he had a mystery that he wanted he
[1:18:28] wanted to but it was a secret
[1:18:31] it was a secret that had to be revealed
[1:18:36] and you know there was only a few that
[1:18:37] saw that
[1:18:39] but you know in time through the
[1:18:41] prophets he began to
[1:18:42] express amos tells us that it was a
[1:18:45] secret
[1:18:47] surely the lord god will do nothing
[1:18:49] except he reveal his secret to his
[1:18:51] servants
[1:18:52] the prophets but revelation tells us
[1:18:56] that we
[1:18:56] that it's a mystery
[1:19:00] because in the beginning when something
[1:19:02] is uh when something is
[1:19:04] hidden it's a secret
[1:19:09] so he's like if if i told wade something
[1:19:11] earlier
[1:19:12] and y'all didn't know that i had told
[1:19:14] him anything it's a secret because y'all
[1:19:16] don't know anything about it
[1:19:18] but you know as soon as i declare that i
[1:19:20] told wade
[1:19:22] something and y'all don't know what it
[1:19:24] is then it becomes a mystery
[1:19:26] because you've been made aware that
[1:19:28] something has been spoken
[1:19:30] right right and as soon as it becomes
[1:19:32] spoken
[1:19:34] then it becomes the mystery
[1:19:37] so what laid in the back part of god's
[1:19:39] mind was a secret
[1:19:41] but when he began to declare that then
[1:19:44] he was declaring
[1:19:45] what he knew to the prophets
[1:19:48] that was a secret to the prophets
[1:19:50] because he was making himself known
[1:19:52] then he began to declare to the people
[1:19:54] what he said
[1:19:55] and that became a mystery
[1:19:58] and then the mystery had to be made
[1:20:00] known
[1:20:01] [Music]
[1:20:02] and so that's what god has desired in
[1:20:05] our day is to
[1:20:06] all through the scripture all the things
[1:20:08] that people go back and they read things
[1:20:10] but you know what it's a it's a
[1:20:11] it's a mystery so sure they're reading
[1:20:15] all the stuff that jesus said in isaiah
[1:20:17] and and
[1:20:18] jeremiah and moses and all that but you
[1:20:21] know they don't see jesus christ in that
[1:20:23] and then and then they they read things
[1:20:25] and the problem is is they don't see
[1:20:27] themselves in the scripture
[1:20:29] it doesn't speak of them it speaks of
[1:20:32] people that have it's been in the past
[1:20:34] but see the thing is is we god wants us
[1:20:36] to read the scripture where we see jesus
[1:20:38] christ in it
[1:20:40] you know it's it's not that we're
[1:20:41] learning historical facts or anything
[1:20:43] but just see
[1:20:45] just like in the feast days when you say
[1:20:46] if you don't see jesus christ if you
[1:20:48] don't see your relationship with jesus
[1:20:50] christ and
[1:20:50] then it's just historical facts it's
[1:20:53] just history
[1:20:54] but if you don't see god wants us to not
[1:20:56] to be
[1:20:57] just just words on the page but he wants
[1:21:00] us to have
[1:21:00] it to be a living instrumentality he
[1:21:03] wants us to see that it's a living thing
[1:21:05] speaking to us
[1:21:06] he wants us to see that it's a
[1:21:08] relationship
[1:21:10] it's a life that's there
[1:21:15] if we don't see that then we've missed
[1:21:17] it
[1:21:18] god wants us god wants us to see these
[1:21:20] things
[1:21:23] and i just want to want to share this
[1:21:25] with you
[1:21:27] you know so many years later brother
[1:21:30] brown was talking about the
[1:21:32] he said that there was a black man
[1:21:35] he said he was standing in a museum and
[1:21:38] that
[1:21:39] black man saw that dress
[1:21:43] that was in that window
[1:21:46] and he said that man
[1:21:52] that man saw that thing and he said you
[1:21:54] know he was just crying
[1:21:58] and he was so overcome with emotion so
[1:22:00] brother branham come over to where he
[1:22:01] was at
[1:22:02] you know he said uncle he said you know
[1:22:04] what's wrong you know what's going on
[1:22:07] and he said all i could see was a dress
[1:22:11] he said i didn't see anything else
[1:22:16] but he said that that black man stood
[1:22:17] there and told him
[1:22:19] he said on that dress is the blood of
[1:22:21] abraham lincoln
[1:22:24] he said and he said i was just thanking
[1:22:26] god
[1:22:28] he told brother branham he said he said
[1:22:30] parson put your hand in here
[1:22:32] on my side
[1:22:35] you know brother brown felt he said
[1:22:37] that's where that slave belt was on that
[1:22:38] man
[1:22:40] had him bound
[1:22:43] and he said it was the blood of abraham
[1:22:45] lincoln
[1:22:47] that set me free
[1:22:50] and he said if a negro
[1:22:53] if a black man could see a blood of a
[1:22:57] man
[1:23:00] the blood of abraham lincoln could cause
[1:23:01] a man to react that way
[1:23:04] he said how much more
[1:23:07] should the blood of jesus christ cause
[1:23:10] us
[1:23:10] to react how much more should we react
[1:23:13] to the blood of jesus christ
[1:23:15] not just not just that we can say that a
[1:23:18] physical belt
[1:23:19] or a physical bondage was on us but you
[1:23:21] know what if we wake up
[1:23:22] and realize you know what spiritual
[1:23:24] bondage has been broken off us
[1:23:26] if we remember where we came from to
[1:23:28] realize where we are today
[1:23:30] then you know what there there's there's
[1:23:32] nothing in this world that can compare
[1:23:33] to that
[1:23:34] you know if it's you know as a soul is
[1:23:36] worth ten thousand worlds then you know
[1:23:38] what
[1:23:38] you know you can't put a price tag on
[1:23:40] that
[1:23:42] and you know you know many times people
[1:23:44] they they you can go along
[1:23:45] and you can you can live in the world
[1:23:47] and you can you can have fun
[1:23:49] you think you're gonna sneak around and
[1:23:50] do different things and you know you can
[1:23:52] just
[1:23:53] walk walk that little line between good
[1:23:55] and you know
[1:23:56] bad and right and wrong and all that
[1:23:58] kind of stuff but you know what
[1:23:59] you know you'll you'll find out that you
[1:24:01] won't play that game too long
[1:24:04] why because sin will carry you further
[1:24:06] than you'll ever want to go
[1:24:13] people you know young people they they
[1:24:15] get so wrapped up in things and
[1:24:17] not realizing
[1:24:21] it's it's a lot of fun for a while
[1:24:24] right just like moses the scripture says
[1:24:27] that he enjoyed the pleasures of sin for
[1:24:28] a season
[1:24:30] well the problem is is you never know
[1:24:32] when it's going to run out
[1:24:35] that pleasure is going to run out after
[1:24:37] a while
[1:24:39] and you never know there's a lot of
[1:24:41] people in this world that's been left
[1:24:42] with a lot of scars
[1:24:46] because of sin and just like that black
[1:24:50] man stood there and told
[1:24:52] brother branham about that slave belt
[1:24:55] you know he still had those scars but
[1:24:58] you know there was a blood to set him
[1:24:59] free
[1:25:01] but let me tell you you don't want to
[1:25:03] have there's a lot of scars that
[1:25:05] that we have that other people have you
[1:25:07] know that you don't want anybody to have
[1:25:09] to go down the same roads that you've
[1:25:10] been down
[1:25:12] to be free from these things and
[1:25:15] and we don't know how much longer we
[1:25:16] have but i i want everybody to be ready
[1:25:19] to go
[1:25:22] you know because i don't want anybody
[1:25:23] left behind
[1:25:26] you don't want to be left behind
[1:25:29] but i want to i want to share everybody
[1:25:31] i want to i just want to share with
[1:25:33] everybody
[1:25:35] there is a blood that can cleanse you
[1:25:38] from all unrighteousness
[1:25:41] it's the great it's the greatest day
[1:25:45] because you know what that blood still
[1:25:47] is still available today it's still as
[1:25:49] powerful as it ever was
[1:25:52] and he's still seeking and save and
[1:25:55] saving
[1:25:56] he's still calling those
[1:25:59] my question is are you going to answer
[1:26:00] the call are we going to be the one
[1:26:02] because you know
[1:26:03] god's not god's not going to just speak
[1:26:05] out of the air
[1:26:06] it's you and i that have to live the
[1:26:08] life to speak to those
[1:26:10] that need to be spoken to
[1:26:13] it's it's our job it's our it's our job
[1:26:16] to speak to people
[1:26:18] to tell them there's a better way just
[1:26:19] like brother wade was saying this
[1:26:21] this morning talking about
[1:26:25] you know can they see that life in you
[1:26:27] when they go
[1:26:28] do they see something different about
[1:26:30] you
[1:26:32] not not that you talk different and that
[1:26:35] you don't do certain things
[1:26:39] but when they walk into your presence
[1:26:43] do they realize there's something
[1:26:44] different about you amen
[1:26:47] you know i want to be in his presence so
[1:26:50] much
[1:26:51] that people around me feel his presence
[1:26:53] also
[1:26:55] you know it's as i preached
[1:26:59] some time back i preached on you know
[1:27:02] you're creating an atmosphere
[1:27:04] a difference between an atmosphere and
[1:27:06] you're an environment
[1:27:08] that's right you know do you live in the
[1:27:11] atmosphere or you dealt with the
[1:27:13] environment
[1:27:16] i told you know the children the hebrew
[1:27:18] children you know
[1:27:19] the environment they were in was a fiery
[1:27:22] furnace
[1:27:25] and you know the people that that led
[1:27:27] them on their way to the furnace after
[1:27:28] it was
[1:27:29] heated seven times hotter it killed them
[1:27:33] but the atmosphere that the hebrew
[1:27:36] children the hebrew boys were in
[1:27:38] was they didn't smell like smoke they
[1:27:41] didn't get sins
[1:27:43] there wasn't there wasn't a hair on
[1:27:45] their head that was injured they didn't
[1:27:47] have anything
[1:27:48] and they stayed in the fire the other
[1:27:50] people didn't even get into fire and it
[1:27:51] killed them
[1:27:54] so are you you know it's just are you
[1:27:57] living in the
[1:27:58] atmosphere because we create the
[1:28:00] atmosphere that we live in
[1:28:02] by the word you can create an atmosphere
[1:28:06] that you know what you can block out the
[1:28:07] environment we live in satan's eden you
[1:28:10] can't control the environment
[1:28:13] you know what devil's always going to
[1:28:15] fight you you're always going to have
[1:28:16] devil trying to put thoughts in your
[1:28:18] head
[1:28:18] there's always going to be things coming
[1:28:20] your way but you know what you create
[1:28:21] the atmosphere
[1:28:24] that you don't give place to the devil
[1:28:26] you you resist the devil and he flees
[1:28:29] from you
[1:28:30] so we have been called to that place to
[1:28:33] stand and fight this battle
[1:28:38] as first timothy 6 said fight the good
[1:28:41] fight
[1:28:42] of faith that's our desire
[1:28:45] god has made a way for us but we got to
[1:28:46] fight this fight
[1:28:48] let's let's fight this this battle we've
[1:28:51] been called

[1:29:28] i'm so glad i have that that blood that
[1:29:31] blood has been applied to me
[1:29:34] you know because it it's just like he
[1:29:37] told the
[1:29:38] the children of israel they had to take
[1:29:40] that blood
[1:29:43] and it didn't and it wasn't that they
[1:29:45] just had to have the blood
[1:29:48] they had to apply the blood and we have
[1:29:51] to have the blood applied
[1:29:54] not just to know about the blood

[1:30:00] of our lives
[1:30:02] you know we all have sins and
[1:30:05] shortcomings and failures

[1:34:44] [Music]
[1:34:56] of jesus
[1:35:02] amen i want to share with you
[1:35:05] a one of my probably one of my favorite
[1:35:09] quotes that lincoln made
[1:35:12] he said and i believe it was after he
[1:35:15] was
[1:35:16] elect reelected
[1:35:19] he said i i intend to run this
[1:35:21] administration
[1:35:24] that when it comes time for me to lay
[1:35:26] down the reins of power
[1:35:28] [Music]
[1:35:30] he said if i've lost every other friend
[1:35:32] in the world
[1:35:34] he said i'll have one friend
[1:35:38] and it'll be inside of me he'll be
[1:35:40] inside of me
[1:35:44] you know if we could live our lives like
[1:35:46] that
[1:35:50] and we can hear well done by a good and
[1:35:52] faithful servant
[1:35:58] so that's that's my desire
[1:36:02] [Music]
[1:36:04] to be more like him every day
[1:36:08] to be like jesus on earth i long
[1:36:15] i have such a burning desire to be like
[1:36:18] him
[1:36:21] all through life's journey from earth to
[1:36:23] glory
[1:36:24] i only ask to be like him
[1:36:28] amen
[1:36:35] i don't know if it does anything for
[1:36:36] y'all but
[1:36:38] it stirs me up

[1:37:17] coveted cases
[1:37:19] in our plant and i think the lord goes

[1:37:26] because i know other places that have a
