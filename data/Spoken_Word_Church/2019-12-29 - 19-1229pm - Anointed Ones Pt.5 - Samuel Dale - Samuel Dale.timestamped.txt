[10:44] better and we appreciate that he's he's
[10:47] able to you know to do things that
[10:50] nobody thought he would ever do where
[10:53] the error and second is ahead to here
[10:54] because you know nobody expected him to
[10:56] be anything I think now they're finding
[10:58] them putting that plate back in where
[11:00] that he won't be so through trouble with
[11:03] falling or anything you don't could
[11:05] really get hurt but just keep praying
[11:07] for him he he wants to go home to the
[11:09] his home you know and I like that I like
[11:13] that too and I don't want to stay over
[11:15] there in the hospital or something like
[11:16] that let me go home and where I can be
[11:19] where I'm at you know no but just
[11:20] remember to keep praying for all right
[11:23] then the Bible study for the youth will
[11:29] be on the 4th starting what did they say
[11:33] 3 or 3 33 on that on the
[11:37] fourth day of January and then at six
[11:40] o'clock that night we will be having the
[11:42] adult Bible study so come and be with us
[11:45] and just you know sit down have a good
[11:47] time talking about the Lord you know and
[11:50] - I'm gonna try to progress if I can
[11:54] enough into finishing up this afternoon
[11:56] of what I'm wanting to bring and then if
[12:00] you will will have questions and answers
[12:02] maybe next Sunday because on that Sunday
[12:06] brother somebody say it with annual
[12:13] brother Nathaniel Greene will be here
[12:16] speaking that Saturday afternoon and
[12:19] then he'll be on the evening services in
[12:21] the evenings of that morning maybe we'll
[12:23] have questions and the answer is in time
[12:25] cuz I'd like to know if there's anything
[12:27] you won't notice got a question what are
[12:29] you talking about that's a question to
[12:32] me it doesn't matter to me somebody
[12:34] that's that blunt what in the world are
[12:36] you talking about I'll try my best to
[12:38] explain what in the world I'm talking
[12:40] about because that's that's what I want
[12:42] you to see what I see and what I believe
[12:46] in this between you and God
[12:47] rest of it because I can't make you
[12:49] believe it I can just maybe keep
[12:52] repeating it until they either bore you
[12:54] with it or you decide to get something
[12:57] done about it so that's a you know that
[12:59] was the story that you the preacher come
[13:01] in you know any preach to get sin
[13:03] against the end you know they're getting
[13:04] everybody to repent and they said well
[13:06] why don't you preach on something else
[13:08] he said let him repent on repent and
[13:11] I'll preach on something else so you
[13:13] know you just write down tell me what
[13:15] you want me to preach them and I'll tie
[13:17] it to the new birth one way or the other
[13:18] that's that's one thing for sure it'll
[13:22] always tie together all right but just
[13:24] remember those things and then remember
[13:27] the fellowship meeting will be here on
[13:29] the third Saturday 3:30 in waves give
[13:34] that brothers name and I can't never
[13:35] remember it but anyhow they'll be here
[13:37] with us okay all right
[13:41] father we thank you for the day in the
[13:44] Grace and the love that you've given
[13:45] unto us we thank you for everything and
[13:47] we just ask you to help us this
[13:49] afternoon Lord
[13:50] to try to speak what's on our heart
[13:53] because that's what we desire to do we
[13:57] desire one thing that is to be used of
[14:00] you to be able to speak to your people
[14:03] then outside of that this body can be a
[14:06] castaway who cares because I just want
[14:09] to help you Lord to the best as I can
[14:11] and maybe that's not the right way to be
[14:13] saying it oh you don't need no help you
[14:15] need for us to get out of the way and
[14:16] then that way would be the greatest help
[14:18] of all but have your way with us forgive
[14:20] our sins lead us my like Grace and look
[14:23] remember the sick ones among us Lord we
[14:25] think about that constantly how that
[14:27] we've all just grown older and older and
[14:30] older and never thought we'd be getting
[14:32] this hold getting nearly 80 years old
[14:34] but Lord then people are just getting
[14:37] sick and worn out and these old bodies
[14:40] are being this becoming a pest house to
[14:43] us but yet we thank you for your loving
[14:46] you grace and just have your way with
[14:47] each one of us got us and had to keep us
[14:49] in Jesus name
[14:51] let's go down in this save time reading
[14:54] we'll start about 20 verse 22 and except
[15:00] those days should be shortened there
[15:02] should no flesh be saved but for the
[15:04] elects sake those days shall be
[15:06] shortened then if any man shall say unto
[15:09] you lo here is Christ or there believe
[15:12] it not for there shall arise false
[15:15] Christ's and false prophets and shall
[15:19] show great signs and wonders and so much
[15:24] that if it were possible it should
[15:26] deceive the very leg now what do we
[15:28] found out by our scripture there that
[15:30] you know if somebody comes among you and
[15:33] brings a sign of wonder and it comes to
[15:35] Pais that God sent these things among us
[15:38] two tries that doesn't sound like a good
[15:42] God but it's your ears you know he knows
[15:45] how to do it but that's that's the point
[15:48] and so much if it were possible they
[15:49] shall deceive the very elect behold I
[15:52] have told you before wherefore if they
[15:54] shall say unto you behold he's in the
[15:57] desert go not forth behold he is in the
[16:00] secret chambers believe it not for as
[16:03] the
[16:04] Lightning cometh out of the east and
[16:07] shinin even unto the West so shall also
[16:10] the coming of the Son of man be so you
[16:13] don't have to worry about him because
[16:14] he's gonna it's going to be made
[16:17] manifest right for horse though ever the
[16:20] carcass is there will the eagle's be
[16:23] gathered together you may be seated and
[16:25] Lord had his blessing to the reading of
[16:27] the word now I pray that what I tried to
[16:34] get across this morning went down deep
[16:36] enough to understand and you know
[16:39] because you know I just try to tell you
[16:41] what I believe and you know then that
[16:44] way it can be resting between God and
[16:47] you as to far as the doing but see oh
[16:50] you know I never thought people to this
[16:53] message after all of the times that
[16:55] we've had and their teachings even back
[16:58] in their denominations and coming down
[17:00] to the people of this message would
[17:02] would ever come to a point that somebody
[17:04] would say that the disciples got born
[17:06] again before Jesus Christ died that just
[17:09] that this goes down into a it just eats
[17:15] me alive that's all I can say about it
[17:18] because after all that God has done and
[17:22] that's the best we can do it disturbs me
[17:26] alive because that's do it but then this
[17:29] morning trying to cover the Pointer
[17:32] thought that those Old Testament Saints
[17:35] they could be anointed yes
[17:39] we're anointed right David was anointed
[17:42] to kill a bar a line a John etc he could
[17:46] be all of those things but the Prophet
[17:48] said he liked the baptism of the holy
[17:50] ghost that was the one thing he needed
[17:53] was the new birth because he they
[17:55] couldn't have that new birth because
[17:57] then when it come to Jesus the first
[17:59] sermon that he preached was to Nicodemus
[18:03] and saying you must be born again well
[18:06] if they had eternal life before Jesus
[18:08] Christ died at Calvary then why would he
[18:10] tell Nicodemus that all he's said to
[18:12] Nicodemus nikodem if you believe what
[18:14] who I am what's going on now you got
[18:15] Holy Ghost
[18:16] and that's pretty well the way it is now
[18:18] right you believe the message of the
[18:19] hour you've been in them you've been in
[18:20] the message for 20-30 years well well
[18:23] you got the Holy Ghost well that's uh
[18:26] that don't suit with me it never has I
[18:28] don't draw I like watermelon or banana
[18:35] pudding okay I like banana pudding what
[18:39] you don't want I despise it when it's on
[18:42] your plate and not on mine see I don't
[18:49] love banana pudding on your plate I love
[18:52] banana pudding on my Play and that's the
[18:55] way I am with the gospel I just love the
[18:58] gospel to be able to feast upon it and
[19:01] the things that we used to question I
[19:04] mean the back of the church I don't mean
[19:07] this that we we know so much or done so
[19:09] well but your church is out there
[19:11] they're teaching things they're not just
[19:13] blinded out to doing nothing and and we
[19:17] would try to teach things in the
[19:18] denominations and I and you know and
[19:21] they've done some pretty good teaching
[19:23] on a lot of good things you know yes
[19:25] that was dark if you just remember where
[19:29] you was at and see I've seen a lot of
[19:31] good things happen and all like that
[19:34] coming down huh and I don't know but I I
[19:37] want it to happen now and that's my
[19:40] whole thing if nothing else all right
[19:44] and see those Old Testament Saints then
[19:46] Jesus Christ wouldn't had to died if
[19:48] they could have got the baptism of the
[19:49] Holy Ghost but they could get anointed
[19:53] right now there's the key that to me
[19:56] that when the Prophet came to that under
[19:59] the anointed ones and was bringing the
[20:02] message I'm just saying what I think see
[20:05] when he comes across there and he's
[20:07] telling on the anointed ones and all and
[20:10] he can read and said now Jesus said
[20:12] these things and we thank God for the
[20:15] opening of the seals that these things
[20:17] could be explained and he looks in there
[20:19] and he begins to see where that
[20:21] anointing is at that it was in the
[20:25] spirit of mankind
[20:27] but not in the soul now watch that after
[20:33] a while if you don't listen to what I'm
[20:35] saying see to me you can have the word
[20:39] every day you live miss it alright you
[20:43] can have the spirit every day you live
[20:45] in this it but when you get them
[20:47] together when that spirit can come down
[20:52] in there and quicken that word to you
[20:55] there to me is the joy that I have is
[20:58] when I'm studying something or thinking
[21:01] about it and I hear the prophets say it
[21:03] nothing all the Lord that that is you
[21:05] know I just don't understand that and
[21:09] all that wants something just goes in
[21:13] that this turned out so clear and you
[21:16] said well there was no other way of
[21:18] saying than that you know you remember
[21:20] the first time when you heard Brett
[21:21] around explaining one God and he said
[21:24] your father your son and you're human
[21:26] well I'd love to had that when I was in
[21:29] the Baptist Church I'd love to have that
[21:32] understanding the bra cuz I was a
[21:34] Baptist believing Baptist doctrine is
[21:37] one true and living God if you don't
[21:39] believe that go find you one and talk to
[21:42] it but yet we couldn't explain it so we
[21:45] explained it God in three persons
[21:47] Blessed Trinity which was just as
[21:49] Trinitarian is anybody else was and
[21:52] that's what cross me wouldn't brother
[21:54] moult said that to me said what do you
[21:55] believe I said one true and living God
[21:58] he said explained I said Garden three
[21:59] persons Blessed Trinity cuz that's all I
[22:01] had he said you just as much of
[22:04] Trinity's it's rest of them I said sir
[22:06] would you explain yourself
[22:07] he said well said a person's a person
[22:10] the personalities or an individual's a
[22:12] person said then you got three guards
[22:15] I'll give me a little more so he said a
[22:18] few more I looked at him when I said I
[22:19] don't believe that no more that's all
[22:22] dad she had a way of expressing what I
[22:26] had always tried to believe you know and
[22:30] see about going okay yeah but you see we
[22:34] get that tied up into the basis that we
[22:37] we all think about it well the point I
[22:40] want you to think of in
[22:41] when I was trying to get across this
[22:42] morning was the one time you think about
[22:44] those Old Testament Saints is what they
[22:46] doing if you don't know what they done
[22:50] read Hebrews 11 right and read of all
[22:55] the things that they've done stopped the
[22:57] mouths of lions killed bears killed this
[23:00] done that you know
[23:02] Samson killing a thousand Philistines
[23:06] with just one old jawbone you know they
[23:10] just think we see he was anointed they
[23:14] took him over there and they finally
[23:15] poked his eyes out and done every time
[23:17] but one day they forgot one thing
[23:21] those dummies there I was going out the
[23:27] thing that she brought her name is that
[23:31] she wound up finding out where his
[23:34] strength was it was in his heart well
[23:37] but you better believe every morning I
[23:40] would have gotten up if I'd have been
[23:42] 110 Philistines and I'd have had 15 of
[23:44] my brothers killed by one man with a
[23:47] jawbone from an old donkey you know I
[23:50] don't want out there every morning I
[23:52] shave that head and I don't even cut the
[23:55] heard of his nose I've got ever higher
[23:57] off that body I could find because Dyer
[24:02] was the strength right
[24:04] I can't but see they didn't they let it
[24:07] go he's blind he can't do nothing he's
[24:12] blind he did have to have a little help
[24:15] well what did he do he told that boy he
[24:17] said words the pillars of this temple he
[24:21] said they're right over here he said
[24:22] okay son he said he would leave the
[24:26] coast up Pires coming back and bird that
[24:30] was something that anointing came back
[24:32] on him that took that temple day on our
[24:35] sea then what great things that happen
[24:38] in those Old Testament Saints you know
[24:41] that this marvelous situations took the
[24:45] place of one person you know what killed
[24:48] so many people are a bunch of of lines
[24:50] or buyers or something just one person
[24:52] just this an anointing from God
[24:55] all right but after all of that it never
[25:00] gave him eternal life then you said well
[25:04] I kind of believed they had eternal all
[25:07] right I ask you a simple question
[25:09] how did it get it but we don't have to
[25:13] understand we just believe it believe
[25:16] what let me ask you a question when a
[25:23] person died in the Old Testament what
[25:24] happened to their soul oh no I know
[25:31] where the body went to the Great Spirit
[25:34] went back to God who gave it okay
[25:35] where'd their soul go so evidently that
[25:44] must not have been eternal life until
[25:45] Jesus come because if they was eternal
[25:48] life in that soul of that man in
[25:49] paradise
[25:51] why did Jesus have to go get him and
[25:53] bring him out why would he not step out
[25:56] during the resurrection would have been
[25:58] nothing back on these things that
[26:03] repairs enough to show to me that those
[26:07] Old Testament Genesis things never had
[26:08] it because that was waiting on him to
[26:11] come pick them up right and say then
[26:16] that's where we get into a lot of things
[26:18] where that's what people don't have but
[26:19] that's okay that's oh no problem just
[26:22] think on these things those Old
[26:23] Testament Saints were not born again
[26:27] they're bad they had to go to paradise
[26:30] to wait until the Lord Jesus went
[26:34] through death burial resurrection
[26:35] ascension and opened the doors of
[26:39] paradise to bring them out see then you
[26:42] can take them up into further months
[26:44] into the scriptures that they raised
[26:46] with him all right
[26:48] paint coming back just a little in it
[26:50] maybe it'll help you alright let's get
[26:53] to that point now to think on it if that
[26:56] be true that they didn't have eternal
[26:58] life well then why would we think that
[27:01] we come into the world with eternal life
[27:06] oh I always was eternal nice quoting the
[27:10] Prophet but if you come into the world
[27:14] with eternal life I ask you a question
[27:16] how did you get it what I always had it
[27:22] you always was eternal then why did
[27:27] Jesus die simple question
[27:31] he wouldn't had to died if he always had
[27:34] eternal life so there's got to be
[27:36] something about that it's not understood
[27:39] alright so he's trying to explain it on
[27:41] anointed ones because he's explaining
[27:45] there he's dead - remember we read it
[27:47] this morning after the opening of the
[27:49] seals now we can see whether or not that
[27:51] we are a Brier or a thistle or ax or
[27:54] something you know we find out where we
[27:56] act well I don't know nothing about
[28:00] seals and I ain't never study no they
[28:02] don't matter to me well does it matter
[28:05] to you if you're born again or not
[28:09] that's no excuse that's no that's no
[28:12] situation to stand before God when he
[28:15] tells the greatest of all religious
[28:16] leaders that the world had ever seen
[28:19] Nicodemus he said you must be born again
[28:24] Nicodemus was one man qualified to be
[28:27] able to step into eternal life don't you
[28:29] think so cause he had everything perfect
[28:31] he was a high priest he was all kind of
[28:33] lying he had it all lined up that he
[28:36] could have this Jesus would have had to
[28:39] come to him and said okay first you got
[28:42] it when he didn't when the one man that
[28:46] could have thought called Jesus wanted
[28:47] the clarity to me that I didn't jesus
[28:50] said thou art a teacher because he
[28:52] declared him to be a teacher
[28:56] he declared Nicodemus to be the greatest
[29:00] ruler teacher of all and since you
[29:02] didn't understand these things all right
[29:04] now think about it as we covered this
[29:08] morning back up just to higher to a
[29:09] thought there is not but one Christ
[29:14] there is one eternal being
[29:20] there is one true and living God
[29:23] there's not many Christ they are in the
[29:27] basis that he can anoint many people to
[29:30] be Christ okay but that don't make many
[29:34] more of them it's the same Christ the
[29:37] prophets will tell you then what like we
[29:39] said this morning the same God that
[29:42] dwelt in Moses the till got a better
[29:47] we're done sir was the same God that was
[29:50] in Balaam to prophesy and write the Word
[29:54] of God let's see we just screams I see
[29:59] that I watch it on your faces you you
[30:02] cringe sometimes it means to me they're
[30:05] not getting it when I cry and I pray and
[30:09] God give me some way to explain it and I
[30:13] try to read what the Prophet had to say
[30:15] about it he said there's only one
[30:16] genuine there's not many Christ there
[30:22] many Christ goes he's in many people
[30:24] yeah it's wonderful but the only one
[30:27] Holy Ghost is only one eternal life
[30:30] there's not two eternal life all right
[30:36] so then the same anointing that was on
[30:38] Moses was owned by them where was it at
[30:42] well now what we've got to figure it out
[30:44] here Moses had the inside of him and
[30:45] Balaam had him going on outside now
[30:49] you're not gonna go nowhere with the
[30:51] Word of God and that terminologies you
[30:56] better get it to where the Prophet would
[30:57] be talking about it he says there's a
[31:00] meaning Christ but there's only one to
[31:03] Christ one Holy Spirit one eternal God
[31:08] all right so then let's keep that doubt
[31:11] in our mind is there only one eternal
[31:13] garden let's move let's read a little
[31:14] bit this afternoon some of these I've
[31:18] already read them to you so I'll read
[31:19] them over again number one anointed
[31:22] wants the endtime brother branham do you
[31:25] believe that that anointing on those
[31:27] people means that it's the anointing of
[31:30] the Holy Spirit yeah
[31:32] sir the genuine Holy Spirit of God upon
[31:37] a person and yet they're false now
[31:49] determining this morning if you were
[31:51] thinking on it and keep it that away
[31:53] then we can go on down a little bit and
[31:55] pick up the thoughts and it'll be there
[31:56] where is the anointing that it's on the
[32:00] spirit the second realm of mankind
[32:05] uh-huh there's where the anointing goes
[32:10] but see that's where we want to make it
[32:12] something different something we want to
[32:15] make it that we're something special oh
[32:18] good praise God with Aurra but not the
[32:21] way you're thinking see that anointing
[32:26] why does it have to go any further than
[32:29] your spirit what's the purpose for the
[32:37] purpose of the Holy Spirit is to quicken
[32:39] the word is that true come on the
[32:44] purpose of the Holy Ghost is to quicken
[32:46] the word the Apostles the Bible said
[32:48] they took the word and held it all right
[32:51] the Holy Ghost came and made that word
[32:53] alive and that was the day of Pentecost
[32:56] when the Holy Ghost fell on them making
[32:59] that word alive in their soul and gave
[33:02] them eternal life in their soul thus the
[33:08] anointed ones that's that listen that's
[33:11] why I kept emphasizing to talk to you if
[33:14] it's the Holy Ghost to come down and
[33:16] quicken the word into your business in
[33:19] your soul that you've took and held and
[33:21] studied it and it's made a part of you
[33:23] then you're sealed in right you're
[33:29] sealed in but remember our point that we
[33:32] brought for months now anointed ones are
[33:34] not sealed in they're actually sealed
[33:38] out well now wait a minute look no no
[33:42] the job of what they're doing
[33:46] justification sanctification the baptism
[33:50] of the holy ghost uh-huh
[33:53] justified claims of that sauce I mean if
[33:56] you know trick it up sanctification
[33:59] cleanses the vessel and the baptism puts
[34:02] the vessel to puts the eternal life in
[34:04] you so try not don't try to well I thank
[34:08] the anointed ones is that that are not
[34:10] genuine are over here and the other than
[34:12] the only ones that are genuine they're
[34:13] over here the difference is the word
[34:20] what was the difference in Balaam who
[34:22] talked about this morning and Moses or
[34:26] Elijah or any of the prophets put there
[34:28] with it what was the difference in their
[34:33] disciples and the rest of them when hey
[34:37] come on the Bible said he was seen of
[34:40] over 500 brethren after his resurrection
[34:45] right where were they on the day of
[34:49] Pentecost according to my calculations
[34:53] that's like 380 of them got disappeared
[34:55] somewhere they didn't think enough of it
[34:57] to go to the Upper Room right yet it
[35:01] called them disciples he was seen of the
[35:06] master his resurrection what you see
[35:14] they didn't stay with the word are we
[35:19] going to stay with the word yeah what
[35:24] about it do you believe that's the
[35:26] genuine holy spirit brother bro
[35:28] he said yes sir then he goes on down
[35:31] this little further on the same quote
[35:32] and he says now that's thus saith the
[35:36] Lord
[35:40] now what about that do you think you and
[35:44] I got any common stupid sense to argue
[35:46] with the dust day of the Lord I don't
[35:51] know
[35:52] sorry about that but he said because of
[35:55] the seals opening we now can understand
[36:00] and these things of the anointed ones
[36:05] all right we can understand it all right
[36:09] so now let's pick up and going down go
[36:12] to number three we read some of this
[36:14] this morning then we'll just pick up the
[36:15] rest and go on hope it don't get boring
[36:18] to you you said brother Branham false
[36:25] prophets the Bible said in the last days
[36:27] there'd be false prophets Jesus said
[36:29] there shall be false Christ not false
[36:33] Jesus's now nobody's standing still for
[36:35] that with false Christ Christ means The
[36:37] Anointed One ones falsely anointed they
[36:41] are anointed but they are false at the
[36:44] bottom of it now what's he talking about
[36:48] at the bottom of it the bottom of it is
[36:53] where you start from right in other
[36:58] words the deepest party use your soul
[37:00] and do great signs and wonders speak in
[37:04] tongues dancing the spirit preach the
[37:07] gospel
[37:07] now tell me anything you can put that
[37:11] something in your life is different from
[37:13] those signs and wonders that you put the
[37:16] Holy Ghost on well I got the Holy Ghost
[37:20] God I saw visions I got the Holy Ghost
[37:24] all right dreamdry you don't know what
[37:30] the new birth is you're in bad shape
[37:32] listen do great signs and wonders
[37:34] speaking tongue preach the gospel Judas
[37:37] Iscariot did it Simon or no I beg your
[37:39] pardon
[37:40] typhus prophesied late let me know all
[37:46] of those things that we would claim our
[37:49] salvation on and put the point of the
[37:52] the danger of our life as to not being
[37:56] lined up with the right word well now
[38:01] then who's got the word office doors are
[38:09] open
[38:11] go ahead to number four well you say
[38:18] these are good people what makes them
[38:20] because one time their top post is on
[38:23] the church and in here and you remember
[38:26] life Sundays a week ago how many was
[38:29] here and heard the sermon on the
[38:31] anointed ones and the last day I think
[38:33] all of you see they are anointed their
[38:36] spirits are anointed in this second room
[38:42] the Spirit is anointed which is the
[38:46] second room of mankind all right so now
[38:50] where is the anointing at what's on your
[38:53] spirit right it's not in your soul
[38:57] it makes alive the word that you have in
[39:00] your soul but if you don't have the word
[39:03] alive how can the Holy Ghost quicken it
[39:09] yeah but I go to church I pretty much
[39:11] either do I Lisa how can you quicker
[39:13] than anything are we gonna make our
[39:20] works what we're saved by I don't not
[39:25] all right
[39:31] don't I go ahead this isn't
[39:36] continuations that go to 1:26 and
[39:38] knoweth it not the words of that now
[39:41] where is your northing to be their
[39:43] spirits are anointed in this second room
[39:47] keep that remember the bottom of it keep
[39:49] that going up now to number five hmm
[39:56] there's a reason that people today don't
[40:00] forget this now and you'll see what the
[40:02] holy what the initial evidence of the
[40:04] Holy Ghost is okay now people can live
[40:09] in this spirit they dance in the spirit
[40:12] they shout in the spirit they go to
[40:14] church in the spirit and they can
[40:16] absolutely have the real spirit of god
[40:20] anointed on that spirit
[40:25] but still be lost and just as devil
[40:31] possessed as they can be with that
[40:35] spirit because watch that's the reason
[40:41] you couldn't tell that woman you
[40:42] remember the story about the woman she's
[40:44] out cutting grass with her shorts on
[40:46] but he said she's such a school teacher
[40:49] or something like that you know she's a
[40:50] teacher she's she's done he said that's
[40:52] why you can't tell her because he's done
[40:55] all these things I mean you're gonna
[41:02] walk up to somebody that's spent their
[41:03] whole life going to church paying their
[41:06] time doing everything the word says and
[41:08] say you're lost you couldn't tell her
[41:17] she's wearing shorts was wrong you
[41:19] couldn't tell her bobbing her higher was
[41:21] wrong well that's what you well what I
[41:23] got to do what it did to Samson now
[41:28] think about it go on to the next one
[41:35] this is red alert lengthy reading this
[41:39] is for thinking let's filter I wish
[41:40] you'd ever listen to the whole message
[41:41] just go ahead and pull it on the up
[41:43] straight town religious spooks and
[41:47] things but not I spoke this morning in
[41:49] life Sunday morning on the wheel in the
[41:53] middle of the wheel you know what that
[41:55] is EQ ler wheel in the middle we won
[41:57] we're under by the way what it's the
[41:59] baptism with the Holy Ghost inside your
[42:01] soul right is the wheel in the middle of
[42:05] the oil wheel in the middle of the wheel
[42:07] or that little inside sole on the inside
[42:10] of the spirit how did the spirit on the
[42:12] outside between the soul and the body
[42:17] can be absolutely anointed with the Holy
[42:21] Ghost
[42:22] did you all understand that they are a
[42:25] man I'm not making a lot I'm just saying
[42:34] if I sitting there I'd say old me but I
[42:37] ain't getting it
[42:43] now to follow that with the continuity
[42:46] of the message the god of this world so
[42:49] he said if you want to read one to go
[42:50] with the northern ones getting god of
[42:51] this god of this evil age is what it is
[42:55] that outside that middle case first
[42:58] circle in the human senses the second
[43:01] circle is the spirit senses will self
[43:04] will desire and so forth but the inside
[43:07] is the soul that soul was predestinated
[43:09] so they can be anointed so they can
[43:13] annoy this spirit to make the outside
[43:16] body come in subjection to the spirit
[43:21] but the soul that sinneth that soul
[43:25] shall die the soul that rejects and
[43:27] unbelief the word of God which is the
[43:29] part of God part of that soul shall
[43:32] eternally as always I believe in eternal
[43:37] death listen I believe in eternal heaven
[43:41] but I do not but not an eternal hell you
[43:50] got I believe in an eternal death that
[43:53] does that need explaining eternal death
[43:56] is this when you were done away with
[43:58] there's no holes who you ever coming
[44:00] back
[44:00] that is that's in the Bible that's it
[44:03] you're done you burned like a fire
[44:07] that's a that's an eternal you can have
[44:09] an eternal death because you're not
[44:13] lighted huh you can now an eternal
[44:17] heaven that was easy to understand right
[44:22] but not an eternal hell God hell was
[44:27] created
[44:29] Foster's I don't it gives me that man a
[44:33] seventh grade education of a man
[44:35] understanding their theologians sitting
[44:37] there looking at him man this guy's all
[44:39] messed up he is goofing up looking at he
[44:43] he sounds like one time he says he
[44:45] believes in eternal hell no time he says
[44:47] he don't he didn't say that he said he
[44:52] believed in eternal
[44:53] yes the bleedin eternal heaven but he
[44:57] didn't believe in an eternal hell cause
[45:02] hell is finally the knowledge there is
[45:06] an eternal death for the people that are
[45:08] and them religious worlds that don't
[45:10] always the one woman that lives in
[45:12] pleasure listen to Bible said see she
[45:15] may be religious but she never was saved
[45:20] she's got an outward motion
[45:24] she might sing in the choir she might
[45:27] dance in the spirit
[45:28] she might speak in tongues and have all
[45:30] the manifestations of the Spirit but
[45:32] unless that soul on the inside is God's
[45:35] daughter see she is gone
[45:38] no matter what she does and listen then
[45:44] where are you anointed that I don't know
[45:47] anything my soul joy to them in the
[45:50] Bible short term in the prophets message
[45:52] or anointing in the soul but don't come
[45:58] up now with something and I'm not saying
[46:00] this wrong I've explained it many times
[46:01] right here and I'll do one more time
[46:04] brother Branham from the time he started
[46:06] in the 40s until he reached somewhere
[46:08] about 63 little more maybe of course 64
[46:12] he was basically I said basically which
[46:16] that means not ever time but close to
[46:19] ever time he was teaching body outside
[46:25] rim second rim so the center rim was the
[46:31] spirit and see people don't even listen
[46:35] to you when you're saying something do
[46:37] you know that before one of the
[46:42] Pentecostal move they did not believe
[46:46] you had a soul until the law came have
[46:49] you ever heard that one they believed
[46:53] you just a body and spirit but when the
[46:55] law came it brought your knowledge so
[46:58] you look good man explain that to me at
[47:02] work I said looks real good but I got
[47:04] one problem he said what I said would
[47:06] you mind reading
[47:06] Genesis where it said did he breathe
[47:09] into that Athens nostril and he become a
[47:11] living soul and you telling me that in
[47:14] how no soul until it come all the way
[47:16] over I said would you mind taking the
[47:18] word soul and run it through the Old
[47:19] Testament and see how many times it's
[47:21] mentioned and why would David to scream
[47:26] out and crying my shoulders trouble see
[47:34] that the point of what I'm trying to
[47:37] explain what I've tried to explain it
[47:39] gets me in trouble to try to explain it
[47:41] but I get in trouble huh you like to be
[47:45] arrogant well no but I don't want to be
[47:48] stupid there's very little difference
[47:52] between arrogant and stupid stupid means
[47:56] you don't want to hear it means you
[47:59] won't take correction will do nothing
[48:00] all right that means you get built up in
[48:02] your own self I'm built up in my own
[48:04] self I'm glad that God has revealed this
[48:07] word to me I do not back off from any
[48:09] thought of that if you think I'm exalted
[48:11] or whatever you think what you want to
[48:12] I'm just so glad of what he's revealed
[48:15] to me aren't you aren't you glad at what
[48:18] God has made known to you if not then
[48:21] you need to get to the altar you ought
[48:25] to be happy about what's been made known
[48:27] to you go out right across there you
[48:29] can't get it
[48:33] listen the prophet that's it basically
[48:39] preached body five sentences so second
[48:45] rim memory reason conscience etc etc
[48:49] Center rim either faith or doubt but
[48:54] when he comes to 63 and you're coming
[48:57] into the last of 63 and hitting the 64
[49:00] he teaches body spirit so you go to
[49:10] get down see fun ride back in before the
[49:15] 63s before 63 and back in the beginning
[49:17] he was teaching body second realm you
[49:20] know outside rim so second rim spirit
[49:22] sent around that's why your to so people
[49:28] could be so confusing with what they
[49:30] were saying because they taught from
[49:35] soul is the nature of the Spirit you
[49:40] wouldn't know if he wasn't back I even
[49:41] talked to him that hardly but but listen
[49:43] after 63 sometimes to the 64 he teaches
[49:47] body spirit and soul he said where did
[49:50] he change that well he changed doing it
[49:55] because I asked you to show me after 63
[49:59] or somewhere there in now 64 show me
[50:03] where he was teaching body soul and
[50:05] spirit I'll show you where he was a
[50:07] teaching body spirit and soul he said
[50:09] well watch that God do it we need to
[50:11] know this to be saved
[50:13] why are you where's the anointing that
[50:23] the brother branham didn't have to
[50:25] correct that because he's right he never
[50:27] changed the senses no matter where it
[50:30] was here or here
[50:31] he always had since number one or
[50:34] position body see taste field smelling
[50:38] here he always taught the second rim as
[50:42] memory reason conscious affections he
[50:46] taught the third rim has to be either
[50:48] faith or doubt he always told it that
[50:55] way he didn't have to change it you said
[50:58] yeah but there is a problem there is a
[51:00] problem maybe God let that be there were
[51:05] you and I could be confused about what
[51:06] we believe in the Prophet talk Oh
[51:10] may I quote the Prophet he done these
[51:13] things to try us cuz if this was
[51:19] nothing's wrong race that now and get
[51:20] this vice versa and I stand and say both
[51:25] them drive because of what he always
[51:28] said body has five senses second realm
[51:32] has five senses spirit has one sense
[51:37] where are you anointed at if you take it
[51:42] here you put the anointing in here now
[51:47] you've got vast problems with your
[51:50] anointing and the spirit realm in the
[51:51] center of the individual that's why I
[51:56] believe the Bible Hebrews 4:12 the Word
[51:59] of God is a discerner between the soul
[52:03] and spirit to join Tamara look teach it
[52:07] the way we've been reading these then we
[52:10] are anointed in your spirit now you got
[52:11] it right
[52:12] body five senses spirit ii remember
[52:14] reason conscious etc there's where your
[52:17] knowing it can be on your spirit and
[52:19] that's as far as that anointing goes it
[52:21] don't go into the soul the anointing
[52:24] quickens the word that you're holding in
[52:25] yourself the Spirit of God quickens the
[52:28] words you have in your soul you don't
[52:34] open up somebody pack Hebrews 13:8 and
[52:38] Little John 3:16 oh we got the word in
[52:40] our soul why did that 380 leave Jesus
[52:49] after his resurrection morning I
[52:53] wouldn't have any son for Jesus to come
[52:54] right in here up here among us and two
[52:58] weeks later you say I don't believe it
[53:01] here that'd be nice wouldn't it did you
[53:10] see what I'm talking about
[53:12] after the opening of the seals they come
[53:16] into plain view the anointing then he
[53:21] could preach the naughty ones the end
[53:22] after the opening of the seal that the
[53:25] anointing would be the anointing on your
[53:27] spirit which would be as I read to you
[53:32] terrible
[53:33] - and i1b the second room you see the
[53:41] difference in in truth of understanding
[53:45] in truth of understanding you'll try
[53:47] your best to see the bread around those
[53:50] messages korat correct all the way
[53:52] through you don't have to change it to
[53:54] make it fit I don't have to say he was
[53:56] wrong here and got right here
[53:58] I didn't say that I said he talked to
[54:01] sign thing all the way through three
[54:03] senses body second realm
[54:06] third ring he was always teaching it
[54:09] right he such that read it that read it
[54:14] wrong and then used it to preach the to
[54:18] show doctrine is based totally upon body
[54:25] soul and spirit
[54:29] who wouldn't around him come around and
[54:31] put the body spirit and soul it
[54:33] annihilated that to soul doctrine come
[54:39] on
[54:39] a lot of you don't know anything about -
[54:41] so doctrine but what they thought was
[54:43] that you receive this soul from God do
[54:47] something you that when you're born into
[54:50] this world you get this is what they
[54:51] teach that ain't right that you get a
[54:54] soul from God and you get a soul from
[54:56] the devil God kills one of them the
[55:07] other one
[55:07] they teach always was eternal there's
[55:10] where your doctrine came of those thing
[55:14] that they taught you always was he told
[55:17] you didn't need any new birth for this
[55:19] soul well number one this is 1970 no
[55:31] more than brothers
[55:32] what's wrong with your doctrine because
[55:36] you're telling me that - sold - sold now
[55:42] according to my prophet Satan cannot
[55:46] create so you're saying he created a
[55:51] soul oh yeah he took your soul that God
[55:55] gave to you and through time he
[55:58] perverted it yes but he didn't give it
[56:02] to you and if he didn't give it to you
[56:08] and God gave it to you why are you
[56:09] killing it cuz that was their doctrine
[56:13] you gotta kill one you got to you gotta
[56:15] kill one of them they admitted that the
[56:23] church we stood back there and fought
[56:25] these things out all the way down
[56:26] through and that's what I've always told
[56:28] I tried to tell them then I said you got
[56:31] it all messed up because you don't
[56:33] understand get it body spirit and soul
[56:39] and do what the Prophet done after the
[56:43] opening of the seals now I say this way
[56:49] cuz I'm human most of you read and we
[56:54] read what we read was from 65 and you
[56:59] never looked over to see what year it
[57:00] was you don't know whether he said it in
[57:03] 62 or 65 or 75
[57:11] but yet I'm an hour key I'm a smart
[57:15] aleck but let's say I'm talk about the
[57:23] word come on the anointing is on your
[57:32] spirit their spirits are anointed and
[57:41] for did we get down we get number five
[57:45] God anointed that spirit he doesn't
[57:50] anoint us whole the either lives in it
[57:54] or don't live in it he don't anoint
[57:57] that's why I tried to get you for three
[58:00] or four weeks now I've been laying that
[58:02] quote in but then it in later when these
[58:04] days it'll don't on you were anointed
[58:07] ones are not sealed in there's nothing
[58:15] to steal for Anointed One but those who
[58:19] have the word took it and held it
[58:21] there's four things of the gospel
[58:23] declares about the disciple the one they
[58:25] took the word and held it one of them
[58:27] they took the word and therefore things
[58:29] that was done in the Gospels with the
[58:31] word to set it up because you know the
[58:34] so and watch sowing of the seed the seed
[58:36] with the children of the kingdom and
[58:41] that set up to where that sow that seed
[58:43] would land in that soul of that
[58:45] individual and when it did the Holy
[58:50] Spirit would come down on and annoy yes
[58:55] that word and make it alive that's why
[59:01] the new birth is a birth of the word
[59:03] it's not you shouted kryder's done this
[59:06] letter deal he has nothing to do with
[59:07] that your prophet I've tried to tell you
[59:09] but you won't listen
[59:15] what did
[59:16] read this morning I want to give you one
[59:22] little joke you the baptism with the
[59:24] Holy Ghost don't mean you're going in
[59:29] not at all not on that don't have
[59:33] anything to do with your soul that's the
[59:42] baptism here's the inside soul this is
[59:47] from the modern events made clear by
[59:49] prophecy it has to come from God then on
[59:52] the outside you have the five senses
[59:54] they contact your earthly home the
[59:57] inside you have a spirit and in there
[59:59] you have five outlets your conscious and
[1:00:02] love and so forth five outlets to that
[1:00:05] spirit remember in that spirit you can
[1:00:08] be baptized with a genuine Holy Spirit
[1:00:10] of God and still be lost
[1:00:17] well I've never heard nothing like that
[1:00:19] where have you been where have you been
[1:00:28] have you read well not know I've never
[1:00:32] read that book leadership many of you
[1:00:40] think I got the baptism of the Holy
[1:00:42] Ghost I'm going to heaven that don't
[1:00:44] mean one thing that you're going to
[1:00:45] heaven no sir you can have the baptism
[1:00:48] of the Holy Ghost
[1:00:48] every hour in your life and still be
[1:00:52] lost and go to hell the Bible says so
[1:00:57] why cuz the Bible said the rain falls on
[1:01:00] the white the just and the unjust the
[1:01:06] anointing strikes are just and the
[1:01:08] unjust the new birth is a birth of the
[1:01:13] word yep we thank you Tommy you just
[1:01:19] need to read the Bible you don't need to
[1:01:21] read the Bible we'll start off with an
[1:01:24] amen but then we settle it with one
[1:01:29] thing just cause you read it
[1:01:30] don't mean you understand it keep
[1:01:33] reading it then about the time you think
[1:01:37] you got it figured out you about halfway
[1:01:39] through reading it we got a gold star in
[1:01:45] the Baptist cuz we read the Bible I
[1:01:47] didn't read mine to get a gold star
[1:01:50] I read mine to find out what he said and
[1:01:54] this is what I said today that I walked
[1:01:56] out of the Baptist Church or I heard of
[1:01:58] this message I said Lord I'm supposed to
[1:02:05] be a Christian according to the word now
[1:02:10] let me be a Christian let me be a
[1:02:16] Christian teach me the things that make
[1:02:22] me a question what about it Dean
[1:02:35] okay let's go ahead - let's just prove
[1:02:39] this point see a lot of you don't think
[1:02:42] there what I say cause you ain't gonna
[1:02:44] go home and look it up you're not gonna
[1:02:49] go home and look it up one predator you
[1:02:52] can go on I'm telling you you ain't
[1:02:53] going home and look it up if you do
[1:02:59] you'll read over and pass over and later
[1:03:01] we never never they will say that I
[1:03:03] don't believe that well I didn't say it
[1:03:08] that's brother branham a question in
[1:03:13] 1961 go ahead number nine now that's a
[1:03:22] hard one please explain the difference
[1:03:24] between the spirit and the soul now
[1:03:30] that's a hard one but the first thing
[1:03:33] you are a trying be just like Father Son
[1:03:35] and Holy Ghost father son Holy Ghost is
[1:03:38] three titles going to one person which
[1:03:42] is Jesus Christ and your soul body and
[1:03:45] spirit but it takes those three to make
[1:03:49] you with with just one of them you're
[1:03:53] not you
[1:03:54] it takes the free to make you body
[1:03:58] spirit soul every which the way you want
[1:04:01] to call it soul spirit body whatever you
[1:04:04] want to call it it takes them three to
[1:04:07] make you right what are you body spirit
[1:04:13] so you turn around say spirit body soul
[1:04:15] yeah but listen whatever I am inside of
[1:04:24] me is going on it's explaining I didn't
[1:04:27] come down the one that's the part part
[1:04:30] that is the spirit the soul is the
[1:04:33] nature of that spirit that when the Holy
[1:04:36] Spirit comes upon you it does not do
[1:04:39] nothing you it changes or converts your
[1:04:44] spirit to a different soul okay
[1:04:48] and the soul is a different nature
[1:04:50] that's on that spirit so the soul is the
[1:04:53] nature of your spirit amen whatever you
[1:04:57] are inside is what you are in the second
[1:04:59] reel we're supposed to be the same thing
[1:05:06] in the outer realm you see that going to
[1:05:18] the next room number 10 the rapture now
[1:05:20] remember this is 61 right now here's 65
[1:05:28] okay
[1:05:30] look at here you're a trying being you
[1:05:33] are inside this little fella here is the
[1:05:35] soul the next is the spirit and the next
[1:05:38] is a body now you got five senses in
[1:05:41] this body to contact your earthly home
[1:05:42] you don't contact the rest of it you've
[1:05:45] got five senses and of the Spirit your
[1:05:47] love and conscious and so forth of that
[1:05:50] but in here is where you live that's
[1:05:53] what you are what are you your a soul
[1:06:00] the Bible doesn't say the spirit that
[1:06:03] liveth is in us he'll die come on let's
[1:06:06] get in the Bible the Bible don't say
[1:06:08] that the Bible don't say the spirit of
[1:06:10] sinners he'll die he says the soul that
[1:06:11] sinneth David even you hadn't cried out
[1:06:16] my soul thirst after thee Jesus cried
[1:06:20] out hanging on the cross I'm so then he
[1:06:26] says into the hands I commit my spirit
[1:06:27] which was his whole being then what
[1:06:36] happened when Jesus died body went to
[1:06:39] the grave spirit goes to God who gave
[1:06:41] that double quote in brother Branham
[1:06:43] where'd he say the soul win it wasn't a
[1:06:45] spirit that went to hell they were in
[1:06:48] the spirit that went to the souls in
[1:06:49] prison it was the soul the soul
[1:06:53] descended and come back up the brother
[1:06:57] Brandon went beyond the curtain of time
[1:06:58] those people told him this
[1:07:02] is souls under the altar so what is your
[1:07:07] soul that's why I don't have no problem
[1:07:10] because I studied it 40 years while they
[1:07:13] was trying to figure out how many souls
[1:07:14] you had I was trying to figure out what
[1:07:16] the Prophet was talking about a soul and
[1:07:19] I read one day where he said in the
[1:07:21] Hebrew book page 80 in the old Hebrew
[1:07:24] book if you want to look at that away
[1:07:27] he says the soul is your theophany no
[1:07:32] but might be off and he's up yonder
[1:07:44] thought your soul is what you are I
[1:07:49] thought that was your being see that's
[1:07:53] why you can be anointed by that spirit
[1:07:56] on the memory reason consciousness a
[1:07:58] connection through from the outside man
[1:08:00] and get into the loves your peace and
[1:08:02] all and you can go out and do wrong
[1:08:06] that's so if you'll just listen to it
[1:08:11] it'll keep you straight it'll keep you
[1:08:16] lined up it'll stop you from going out
[1:08:22] there and doing those things so I don't
[1:08:25] want salvation in my spirit now don't
[1:08:30] misunderstand me I wanted in my soul
[1:08:33] working out through my spirit out
[1:08:35] through my body and I admit somewhere
[1:08:38] between and I read you a quote while ago
[1:08:40] that the spirit was between us the the
[1:08:43] soul and the body somewhere in between
[1:08:46] ours our problem the spirit realm right
[1:08:55] memory reason conscious affections and
[1:09:02] all of that can go wrong okay come on
[1:09:06] swallow Jesus was tempted work now
[1:09:14] according to the Bible that no man can
[1:09:19] tempt God are you with me no man came
[1:09:26] till God be stupid is right Jesus was
[1:09:34] tempted were not in his soul there was
[1:09:40] any spirit if memory reason conscious he
[1:09:44] was a human being he saw just like we
[1:09:46] say now brother branham I didn't said
[1:09:49] run around and said he was tempted of
[1:09:50] women the more you you you sure no I
[1:09:56] just tell it where it is
[1:09:58] he was a human mortal being in body
[1:10:03] subject to the five senses working upon
[1:10:06] his memory reason consciousness in his
[1:10:09] spirit realm but inside of him he never
[1:10:12] sinned inside of him he never lusted in
[1:10:19] that soul no if we could ever get our
[1:10:26] senses right get to the point
[1:10:28] yeah we've got to have everything just
[1:10:30] like what I'm saying when brother
[1:10:33] Branham said beyond the curtain of time
[1:10:34] he said the angel of the Lord said this
[1:10:36] is souls under the altar that can't be
[1:10:39] so gunpowder go souls on the outer the
[1:10:42] fifth seal more we're smart we got it
[1:10:47] all figured out but the angel said it
[1:10:52] was sold on the older you see we've got
[1:10:59] so much knowledge until it puffeth up
[1:11:06] when he went to our beyond the curtain
[1:11:08] of time that was his soul he said well
[1:11:13] where was he yet come on
[1:11:15] let's don't be too far gone there is
[1:11:21] such a thing called soul travel man's
[1:11:23] always taught about that that you can go
[1:11:28] out have an outer experienced market
[1:11:30] report that's what happened to brother
[1:11:33] Branham his body was laying on the bed
[1:11:35] there on the bed was a body spirit and
[1:11:38] her soul of a man but yet soul travel he
[1:11:42] went into another dimension because it
[1:11:46] was a prophet and subject to the
[1:11:48] dimensions and when he got there he
[1:11:51] could see the people and fail him and
[1:11:54] they said this is souls under the altar
[1:11:57] we'll see we're so smart no that's not
[1:11:59] so girl so grounded out or fifth sealed
[1:12:01] you brother brother man said that
[1:12:09] how long will we toil in their minds how
[1:12:14] long will it be until we get settled
[1:12:19] then get our human minds out of the way
[1:12:24] then we talk about a change then we can
[1:12:30] talk about a brother Dale the way you've
[1:12:37] brought it out to services of course you
[1:12:39] about for services you've brought it out
[1:12:42] that the anointed ones was anointed on
[1:12:48] their spirit I brought that out because
[1:12:52] I believe it what's your profit talk he
[1:12:55] also called that people that are to be
[1:12:58] true born-again believers the anointing
[1:13:02] is on their spirit but it quickens the
[1:13:06] word that they've held in their soul
[1:13:07] whereas the other can't be quickened why
[1:13:10] was it caucus couldn't be quickened he
[1:13:18] confessed who he was
[1:13:20] that you're a man sent from God nobody
[1:13:22] can do the things that you've done
[1:13:23] unless God be with you what was the
[1:13:29] difference if in koffice in Jesus one
[1:13:34] was the word what are you saying the
[1:13:41] word will tell everything the word tells
[1:13:46] what we are that's why it's so dangerous
[1:13:50] to play and say well you know we don't
[1:13:54] have to understand these things
[1:13:56] we just believe in God and doing the
[1:14:00] best we can do are we
[1:14:13] how do you know whether you're anointed
[1:14:15] or not I hope you've got down to that
[1:14:20] point at least you say what I'm saying I
[1:14:22] believe that every person that's
[1:14:25] anointed is anointed on their spirit
[1:14:27] that there's no such thing as anointing
[1:14:30] in their soul
[1:14:30] show me the Prophet the anointing is on
[1:14:38] your spirit ring now let's sink that
[1:14:44] real good let's see if I can keep the
[1:14:46] memory only Christians sin you agree
[1:14:53] with that do you agree down quote and
[1:14:57] brother Branham no only Christians sin a
[1:15:02] sinner is condemned on a higher level
[1:15:04] he's automatically condemned he's not a
[1:15:07] sinner he's condemned sin has done I
[1:15:11] elated him out of the way the only of
[1:15:14] Christians have sins all right now then
[1:15:20] if all the Christians have sins the
[1:15:24] Bible said he's a sinner she'll die that
[1:15:30] right it's in her she'll die
[1:15:33] all right now brother Bob you ever had a
[1:15:38] dirty thought Oh at least he admits it
[1:15:41] mom still getting red face and say no
[1:15:45] how about it you had a wrong thought now
[1:15:53] let me get that straight remember you
[1:15:55] can have a wrong thought and not sin
[1:15:58] come on we do we spend four hours
[1:16:01] explaining it but you know the wrong
[1:16:02] thought I'm not saying about it because
[1:16:05] that's Satan tempt in you because Jesus
[1:16:07] had to have that thought in his mind
[1:16:11] process to be able to lust you agree all
[1:16:17] right
[1:16:18] see now what where was it at that you
[1:16:21] had the wrong thought it couldn't be in
[1:16:23] your body because that body's worth
[1:16:25] nothing they don't think it has
[1:16:27] motivators in the inside it's not your
[1:16:31] soul good things that where's it at
[1:16:35] you know I mean to me
[1:16:37] if you'd listen if you just listen I'm
[1:16:42] stupid Oh idiot to try to explodes over
[1:16:45] do you realize if you have a wrong
[1:16:47] thought under your concept of the fact
[1:16:51] that if you think wrong you're lost then
[1:16:54] you're lost but if you have a thought
[1:17:01] process or something happens that's just
[1:17:04] your thought coming in you can't help
[1:17:06] that listen folks I spent two years
[1:17:11] fighting this man this devil of that
[1:17:14] dough brother mote one day said it he
[1:17:16] said brother Dale you going crazy I said
[1:17:20] I know it but he said you got to stop
[1:17:25] and cut this devil off where he's at
[1:17:28] said let that thought come and then turn
[1:17:31] it down lose it oh god you can't stop it
[1:17:37] from coming but what was the story you
[1:17:39] keep it from building this nesting on
[1:17:42] her this message has got the most
[1:17:47] wonderful opportunity for a Christian to
[1:17:50] be able to understand who we are and
[1:17:52] what's going on but just remember that
[1:17:56] brother Dale makes another statement I
[1:17:58] don't blame the devil for everything I
[1:18:00] do wrong yeah you say hey what I do know
[1:18:05] I don't blame the devil for the things
[1:18:07] that I do wrong you say you do wrong
[1:18:10] every day you want your prophet fired he
[1:18:14] said every day so what about it the soul
[1:18:19] that sinneth God would have to kill us
[1:18:23] but if that sin is within our spirit rim
[1:18:26] of our memory reason concerts affection
[1:18:28] tonight then God can pass it off with us
