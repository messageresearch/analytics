[0:00] god bless you thanks good morning
[0:06] all right we're made it to hebrews
[0:07] chapter 3 verse 8.
[0:11] in a little study
[0:14] in hebrews chapter 3 verse 8 says hard
[0:16] not your hearts as in the provocation
[0:18] and the day of temptation in the
[0:19] wilderness
[0:21] when your father's tempted me proved me
[0:23] and saw my works 40 years
[0:26] wherefore i was grieved with that
[0:27] generation and said they do always air
[0:29] in their heart and they have not known
[0:31] my ways
[0:32] so i swear in my wrath they shall not
[0:35] enter into my rest
[0:38] now provocation as we were examining
[0:40] last time
[0:42] last week provocation has went is is
[0:44] something you do to make somebody really
[0:46] annoyed or angry
[0:48] so the provocation in the wilderness is
[0:50] when uh you know that to to
[0:52] to make god upset with us is when we
[0:54] when we disbelieve his word and really
[0:57] you know
[0:58] whenever anybody
[1:00] says something it's it's a a horrible
[1:02] slight it's a it's an insult to not
[1:05] believe what somebody says
[1:07] you know if you tell if you tell
[1:09] somebody i'm going to do something for
[1:10] you and they don't they don't believe it
[1:12] or i'm going to be there at such a time
[1:14] and they don't believe you and they're
[1:15] they're late or whatever
[1:17] it it's it becomes
[1:19] something that's a little insulting
[1:21] now think about how god feels and we
[1:23] don't believe his word
[1:25] now so so this whole story that we're
[1:27] they're kind of unfolding the
[1:28] provocation is uh that paul is talking
[1:30] about here the provocation is these
[1:32] people that cannot enter into the rest
[1:34] and and when we go on over into hebrews
[1:36] chapter four hebrews chapter four talks
[1:38] more about what that rest is
[1:40] with the rest the rest is when you're
[1:43] not you're not laboring anymore you're
[1:45] you're uh
[1:47] god's doing you you enter into a place
[1:50] where you're settled and god's god's the
[1:51] one that's doing the work and you don't
[1:54] you're not
[1:55] say maybe thrashing anymore
[1:58] so if we go to the next slide brother
[2:01] said they heard it but they didn't
[2:02] believe it
[2:04] god come down he showed them a pillar of
[2:06] fire showed by his prophets signs and
[2:08] wonders he was with him they didn't
[2:10] believe it oh they like to see the
[2:11] miracles they like to hear the prophet
[2:14] but as far as believing it they didn't
[2:18] their lives proved they didn't
[2:20] now he said don't you fall after that
[2:22] same example of unbelief for in this
[2:24] last days to the gentile church god has
[2:26] appeared again same sign same wonder
[2:28] same pillar of fire vindicated proven
[2:31] let us not harden our hearts and fall in
[2:34] that temptation back yonder of unbelief
[2:37] will for will rot on earth
[2:39] and that'll be all of it
[2:43] now if we go to the next slide
[2:45] what we were kind of getting at last
[2:46] last uh sunday is is is to really get
[2:49] the full uh gist of what this is talking
[2:52] about you have to see where you are and
[2:54] you know when you when you read the word
[2:56] and you when you come to church the word
[2:58] begins to open up and reveal to you
[2:59] where you are again whether that's
[3:01] you're you're not born again or you are
[3:03] born again and you're going through a
[3:05] journey up to the adoption or you're or
[3:08] you are adopted and now the seals can
[3:10] become open to you and god can reveal to
[3:12] you that the whole plan of redempt of
[3:15] your redemption and that it's been done
[3:18] and how to take a body change
[3:20] so all of those things now that you kind
[3:22] of picture in your mind the bulk really
[3:25] of a christian life
[3:26] happens at this little place of
[3:28] sanctification
[3:29] joint going through the wilderness
[3:31] getting all these going through a
[3:33] testing time and getting these things
[3:34] purged out of us and and god examining
[3:37] our faith to see
[3:38] if we're really going to stand the test
[3:41] and and believe his word in spite of all
[3:43] the obstacles
[3:44] so as you look at what all these things
[3:47] that the children of israel were going
[3:48] through they went through a lot of hard
[3:50] times and and a lot of rough things
[3:52] happened and and and strange things and
[3:55] and yet uh in all
[3:57] just about every time they faltered and
[3:59] they failed to believe god's word and
[4:01] then they would begin to blame moses and
[4:03] aaron and and say well
[4:05] god judge you and all these kind we'll
[4:07] examine these things in a little bit and
[4:08] so really as we look through these
[4:10] things maybe just take a moment to
[4:12] examine our own heart and see
[4:15] could we be doing
[4:17] the same things today that they were
[4:18] doing back then because wherever you are
[4:21] in your journey
[4:23] if you disbelieve god's word is going to
[4:25] prevent you from coming to that stage of
[4:27] rest
[4:28] whether that's a new birth
[4:30] or adoption
[4:32] or a body change
[4:35] so on the next slide we look to that
[4:37] journey again that uh just i'm just
[4:40] gonna run through some of these for a
[4:41] quick background
[4:43] justification sanctification the
[4:45] baptismal holy ghost is the journey of a
[4:47] believer
[4:48] and on the next slide
[4:49] going up from
[4:52] go to go to the next slide one more
[4:56] you go you're you go through
[4:57] justification sanctification the baptism
[5:00] of the holy ghost now you're born again
[5:02] and now you're of faith
[5:04] and then
[5:05] as uh as paul said i think it's first
[5:07] corinthians
[5:09] if those who he has predestinated he
[5:11] called and those he called he justified
[5:14] and those he justified he's already
[5:16] glorified
[5:17] now we're talking about now you're
[5:19] justified
[5:21] and so you begin to be purged as you go
[5:23] through the statue of a perfect man
[5:25] god cleaning you out cleaning your life
[5:27] and then you can be baptized with the
[5:29] token the true baptism of the holy ghost
[5:32] the baptism holy ghost on your life to
[5:34] be in reveal what's the baptism of the
[5:36] holy ghost god he's trying to get you to
[5:38] a place
[5:39] to play when you when you're born again
[5:41] he gets you to a place where you can
[5:42] believe
[5:43] he fills you with his life and now he's
[5:45] the one doing the believing
[5:47] let's go and he as paul said in
[5:49] galatians the life that i now live i
[5:50] live by the faith of the son of god is
[5:52] his faith now in you believing
[5:54] so now when he gets you to adoption now
[5:56] he comes and he's got you to a place
[5:58] again
[6:00] where he can begin opening up the word
[6:02] to you
[6:02] you really really
[6:04] now message preachers in this day we're
[6:06] we're supposed to really be preaching
[6:08] you're not really even preaching the
[6:09] message to you preaching preaching that
[6:12] that message that's what we're trying to
[6:14] get everybody to a place where we can
[6:16] preach the message
[6:18] but not just some little baby form but
[6:20] actually preach the message because then
[6:22] the seals can be opened up to you and
[6:24] the word can really be opened up to you
[6:26] that so that we can go we can take a
[6:28] body change so when you go up to
[6:30] adoption now now where you're on a
[6:33] journey you're on a journey to take a
[6:35] body change and that's the final baptism
[6:37] of the holy ghost that's that's uh
[6:40] that's that's really deep well i guess
[6:43] now brother brahman an adoption message
[6:45] in 1960 he said there was three stages
[6:47] of the journey and there's three stages
[6:50] of this journey
[6:51] for we are justified by faith believing
[6:54] on the lord jesus christ forsaking the
[6:55] land of egypt come out and then are
[6:57] sanctified through the offering of his
[7:00] blood washed from our sins and become
[7:01] pilgrims and sojourners
[7:04] claiming that we are seeking a land a
[7:06] city that's coming or a promise
[7:08] so did israel in the wilderness
[7:09] sojourners no place to rest traveling
[7:12] night after night following the pillar
[7:14] of fire but finally come to the promised
[7:16] land where they settled down and so the
[7:19] promised land is your rest
[7:21] and the promised land is the baptism of
[7:23] the holy ghost that's what you've been
[7:25] promised and in that there's a lot of
[7:28] things
[7:29] like like uh
[7:31] there's a lot of things that go into the
[7:32] baptismal holy ghost like we were just
[7:34] explaining it's more than just a little
[7:36] one uh one little baby form thing
[7:39] there's but as it unfolds it becomes
[7:41] richer and richer and there's
[7:43] and and each stage brings you to a place
[7:46] of rest
[7:47] don't you know that after you climb the
[7:49] statue of perfect man and you finally
[7:50] get to where you're going now you can
[7:52] rest but you ain't done yet there's more
[7:55] to it
[7:58] but now in hebrews chapter 3 brother
[7:59] brown said he said paul trying to get
[8:02] later on get down here the experience
[8:04] that he had trying to relate the
[8:06] experience he typed it to the old
[8:08] testament he said now we've entered into
[8:10] a new thing
[8:12] to this new dispensation by jesus christ
[8:16] old times the lord appeared to them by
[8:18] the prophets that's hebrews 1
[8:21] but now he's by his son jesus now he
[8:23] said they enter not
[8:25] because of their unbelief
[8:27] they did not believe
[8:29] but now we move into a dispensation and
[8:32] don't you harden your heart
[8:33] don't you act like they did in the days
[8:35] of provocation when they provoke god now
[8:37] listen to this now how do they do it
[8:40] how do they provoke god
[8:42] not by living immorally
[8:45] he said let me grind this down to you
[8:48] you say brother branham i go to church
[8:50] that's all right
[8:52] i never lied in my life that's fine
[8:55] i never stole i've never done this that
[8:57] or that sounds like the rich young ruler
[8:59] i've kept all these things all these
[9:00] things have i done
[9:02] that's very fun that's all good but that
[9:05] still isn't sin the sin
[9:07] is when god shows himself
[9:10] and you disbelieve it
[9:11] you won't listen to it
[9:14] when god shows you and you won't listen
[9:16] to it
[9:17] now see see see it disbelief now this
[9:20] that's maybe a sticking point i'm born
[9:22] again can i disbelieve god's word well
[9:25] now now think about adam and eve in the
[9:27] garden of eden
[9:29] had the holy ghost had had the life of
[9:31] god down in their soul but yet here
[9:33] comes the certain along and gives them a
[9:35] little something off the word and it and
[9:37] it and they get snared in it
[9:39] now now see when when you as you're
[9:41] going up the statue of perfect man
[9:43] you're born again but yet you still have
[9:45] problems like somebody will say
[9:46] something somebody will we'll point out
[9:48] maybe some things in the message that
[9:50] seem like they're contradictory and you
[9:51] get all confused and if you don't if
[9:54] you're not looking at it right you'll
[9:55] you'll just you'll you'll cast it aside
[9:57] and say i don't i don't i don't i i
[9:59] don't agree with that
[10:01] and you won't be able to go further
[10:04] so now let's let's examine some of these
[10:06] things
[10:08] harden out your hearts on the next slide
[10:10] as in the provocation
[10:12] now there's 14 times if you run through
[10:15] the story of exodus and numbers it
[10:16] carries on into numbers where and and
[10:18] i'm not going to linger too much on
[10:20] these things because um i mean you could
[10:23] you could spend
[10:24] weeks and weeks on on each one of these
[10:26] but we're just going to take a quick a
[10:28] quick tour
[10:29] of some of these things that the
[10:30] israelites did as they were journeying
[10:32] out of out of egypt
[10:34] now the first thing they did when before
[10:36] they even really got started was was uh
[10:39] when moses went down there with a
[10:40] message and he came and he said i'm i'm
[10:42] coming to deliver you
[10:43] and they uh pharaoh heaped on he started
[10:46] heaping on them all of the some extra
[10:48] work
[10:49] and uh
[10:50] and and they said no it says here in
[10:53] exodus chapter 5 verse 19
[10:55] and the officers of the children of
[10:57] israel did see that they were in an evil
[10:58] case after it was said ye shall not
[11:00] minish all from your breaks of your
[11:02] daily task
[11:04] and they met moses and aaron who stood
[11:05] in the way as they came forth from er
[11:07] from pharaoh and they said unto them the
[11:09] lord look upon you
[11:11] and judge
[11:13] the lord look upon moses and judge
[11:15] because you have made our savior to be
[11:17] abhorred in the eyes of pharaoh and in
[11:19] the eyes of his servants to put a sword
[11:21] in their hand to slay us
[11:23] so right away they get uh they're
[11:25] starting on their journey
[11:26] and they they get a little bit of
[11:29] hardship now in that what we do we when
[11:31] we get a little bit of hardship you know
[11:33] you think about all the hard things that
[11:34] brother branham had to endure in his
[11:36] life watching god uh allow his wife and
[11:39] his baby to die and
[11:41] and uh just the story of the flood and
[11:44] just on and on and on but yet he he kept
[11:46] pressing on and you you go read like for
[11:48] example hebrews 11 and you can see all
[11:50] the hardships that isaiah had to endure
[11:52] as he was being chased by manassas we
[11:54] were talking about wednesday night being
[11:56] killed and all the different ones that
[11:58] were uh thrown into the uh
[12:00] eaten by lions and all those sorts of
[12:02] things and
[12:03] you know when when you get a into a hard
[12:06] place at work or or a hard place with
[12:08] your family it's not time to turn back
[12:10] it's not time to get slack or it's not
[12:12] time to stop believing god's word but
[12:15] it's time that's that's when you should
[12:17] really buckle down and say it's hard but
[12:19] yet i'm i'm i'm holding on or there's
[12:21] something holding me
[12:23] that i'm i'm believing despite all the
[12:26] obstacles despite all the circumstances
[12:28] and things that i can see i'm believing
[12:30] despite everything that i can see
[12:33] now see
[12:34] they in their disbelief what did they do
[12:36] and you'll see this echoed all
[12:38] throughout all of these all of these
[12:39] provocations
[12:40] they turn their blame not they instead
[12:43] of looking at themselves
[12:44] their self they turn their blame on
[12:46] moses
[12:48] and that's a strange
[12:50] a strange uh symptom of the human
[12:53] condition
[12:54] to look to not just blame somebody else
[12:57] but to blame to blame the preacher
[13:00] to blame
[13:02] to blame the one that's trying to help
[13:04] them out and they turn their turn their
[13:07] finger pointer on the preacher and say
[13:09] it's the preacher's fault why are my
[13:11] family's in this condition or it's the
[13:13] preacher's fault why things don't seem
[13:15] to be going on and they said the lord
[13:18] look upon you and judge
[13:20] because we're going through a hard time
[13:23] now let's go on to the next one
[13:26] when they got to the red sea and this is
[13:27] where brother brown preached that sermon
[13:29] why christ speak and you know if you go
[13:31] back and listen to that he uh he he
[13:33] backgrounds for most of that sermon
[13:35] talks talks about how he all these
[13:37] things that they had seen the plagues
[13:39] and
[13:40] all of these things that had built up
[13:41] that where they should have moses
[13:43] especially he should have been built up
[13:45] to a place where he knew what his
[13:46] purpose was and they got there and the
[13:49] egyptians were marching after them and
[13:51] that
[13:52] and the children of israel said and they
[13:54] said unto moses in verse 11 because
[13:56] there were no graves in egypt
[13:58] i still taken us away to die in the
[14:01] wilderness
[14:02] wherefore hast thou dealt with us
[14:05] to carry us forth out of egypt now now
[14:08] you think about what egypt means
[14:10] egypt means and we'll see here in a
[14:12] second it means that they called it the
[14:14] the the bible calls it the flesh pots of
[14:16] egypt that we've left the flesh pots and
[14:19] and egypt egypt represents
[14:22] all that trash that you're leaving
[14:24] behind
[14:25] and all the time they were going through
[14:27] they were going through this journey
[14:28] they kept looking back to the trash and
[14:30] looking or or let's say like this
[14:32] depending on where you are in your
[14:34] journey looking back to their previous
[14:36] condition
[14:37] looking back you know when you're an
[14:39] adult you don't want to go back to being
[14:41] a baby
[14:42] and when you're when you're when you're
[14:43] born again you don't want to go back to
[14:45] being a sinner but yet they kept looking
[14:47] back to i i wish we were it would have
[14:50] been better for us to be back in that
[14:52] condition than where we are now
[14:54] following the pillar of fire following a
[14:55] god chosen man following you know
[14:58] god with us god
[15:00] causing water to come forth from the
[15:01] rock giving us everything we need giving
[15:03] us bread
[15:04] with us with us day by day it would have
[15:06] been better you think what a strange
[15:09] thing but yet even even today people
[15:11] still exhibit that same trait i would
[15:14] rather i would rather be in my previous
[15:17] condition
[15:20] and they said wherefore hast thou dealt
[15:21] with us
[15:23] is not this the word that we did tell
[15:24] thee in egypt i told you this was going
[15:26] to happen
[15:28] saying let us alone
[15:30] let us alone that we may serve the
[15:32] egyptians now you think about the grace
[15:34] of god to rescue like light lot down
[15:37] there where the angels actually had to
[15:39] put their hands on him and say let's go
[15:41] and god in his grace will come and and
[15:44] and give us a word and give us ministers
[15:46] to deal with us and and almost like
[15:48] sometimes seems like forcing us to get
[15:51] out
[15:52] let us alone that we may serve the
[15:54] egyptians for it had been better for us
[15:56] to serve the egyptians
[15:58] than that we should die
[16:01] in the wilderness
[16:02] let's go to number three
[16:05] and when they finally got to some more
[16:07] hard times they got to a place they the
[16:09] first place that god sent them was the
[16:11] bitter waters where they got to a place
[16:13] where where uh the waters they thought
[16:15] were going to be fresh and they were
[16:16] bitter now they started murmuring
[16:18] against moses in verse 24.
[16:21] what shall we drink they needed some
[16:23] water to drink and instead of realizing
[16:25] that that same god that part of the red
[16:27] sea
[16:28] the same god that caused all the plagues
[16:30] and changed pharaoh's hearts so he said
[16:32] i'll let you go and and gave him gold
[16:35] and everything as they were leaving go
[16:36] take from gold from your neighbors and
[16:38] provided everything they had need of
[16:41] instead of realizing that that same god
[16:43] was on the scene to make those waters
[16:45] pure again they started murmuring again
[16:47] against moses
[16:50] what shall we drink
[16:51] and he cried unto the lord and the lord
[16:53] showed him a tree showed him now you see
[16:56] he went over there and he grabbed the
[16:57] tree he knew what to do
[17:00] he knew you know
[17:01] think about how jesus is typed with the
[17:03] tree he's a true the tree of life and
[17:05] that tree of life was crucified on the
[17:07] tree
[17:08] so he moses went over and and and
[17:10] grabbed the tree and threw it in the
[17:12] water and it became pure again
[17:14] and he said and it says when he cast
[17:16] into the waters the waters were made
[17:17] sweet
[17:18] there he made for them a statue and an
[17:20] ordinance and there he proved them and
[17:23] said
[17:23] if thou wilt diligently hearken to the
[17:26] voice of the lord thy god and will do
[17:28] that which is right in his sight and
[17:29] will give ear to his commandments and
[17:32] keep all his statutes
[17:33] i will put none of these diseases upon
[17:36] thee which i have brought upon the
[17:38] egyptians
[17:40] for i am the lord that healeth thee
[17:42] now if they have that same kind of
[17:44] promise we've got that same kind of
[17:45] promise today
[17:47] and when you get into a bad time when
[17:49] you get to bitter waters or whatever
[17:52] these stories that we're reading through
[17:53] whatever
[17:54] situation
[17:56] don't do like them but just believe god
[17:58] that's that's all he expects us of us is
[18:01] just to believe in
[18:03] so they kept marching on and they they
[18:05] got to the fourth provocation they got
[18:07] to a place where they they got a little
[18:08] bit hungry
[18:10] and it says they took their journey from
[18:12] elam and all the congregation of the
[18:14] children of israel came into the
[18:16] wilderness of sin
[18:17] now now you notice that next the next
[18:19] one after this is thirst this one's
[18:21] hunger and the next one's thirst
[18:23] and god
[18:24] we so many times we look for things
[18:27] things outside of the word outside of
[18:30] the spirit of god to quench our hunger
[18:32] and thirst just like they they started
[18:34] they started looking back to where they
[18:36] come from i i wish i wish i had all all
[18:39] of the stuff in egypt now this is the
[18:41] the scripture where it says about flesh
[18:42] parts and the children of israel said
[18:44] unto them what to god we have died by
[18:46] the hand of the lord in the land of
[18:47] egypt
[18:50] when we set by the flesh pots
[18:52] and when we did eat bread to the full
[18:54] for you have brought us forth under this
[18:56] wilderness to kill this whole assembly
[18:58] with hunger
[18:59] now you know isn't that an interesting
[19:01] word flesh pots
[19:03] flex pots really has a double meaning it
[19:05] means like a bowl full of meat yeah but
[19:07] it also means
[19:08] like las vegas
[19:10] it means like the sin of the world and
[19:12] so they were they were wanting to go
[19:14] back into that now now you think they
[19:16] they were at a place all all that
[19:18] background and yet they wanted to go
[19:20] back into that that place of sin and
[19:23] then said the lord unto moses behold
[19:25] i will reign bread from heaven for you
[19:29] now you see how
[19:30] how easy it is
[19:32] easy it was for them to to just get
[19:36] they they they didn't realize that god
[19:38] was with them
[19:43] and the people shall go out and gather a
[19:44] certain rate every day that i may prove
[19:46] them whether they will walk in my law
[19:49] now let's give the next one the number
[19:51] number five
[19:52] and all the congregation of the children
[19:54] of israel journeyed from the wilderness
[19:56] of sin after their journeys according to
[19:58] the commandment of the lord and pitched
[19:59] him to fit them and there was no water
[20:02] for the people to drink you remember
[20:03] brother graham preached that sermon
[20:04] thirst or sermons lots of sermons on
[20:07] thirst about how that you try to quench
[20:09] that thirst that god has given you that
[20:12] holy thirst with the things of the world
[20:14] and instead of that that thirst that god
[20:16] has given you is a thirst for him
[20:19] and and and god
[20:21] god provided he provided a way for their
[20:23] thirst to be quenched here when he told
[20:25] moses to smite the rock and there shall
[20:27] come water out of it now now when he
[20:29] smoked that rock i i know we know the
[20:31] dramatization it wasn't just a little
[20:33] trickle but it was a great big gusher
[20:35] that the bible says it came forth as a
[20:37] river and paul said and uh uh
[20:40] it is i
[20:42] might be first corinthians
[20:43] i think it's first corinthians he said
[20:45] that that rock followed them that it
[20:47] followed them through the wilderness so
[20:48] wherever they went that rock was with
[20:50] them that they could you think about
[20:52] that they could look over there and see
[20:54] that that rock was being provided that
[20:56] the water was being provided for them a
[20:58] continual stream enough to feed two
[21:00] million people
[21:02] and yet
[21:03] you know
[21:04] even today when you when you come into
[21:06] church into the sanctuary of the lord
[21:07] and and and you and you might be thirsty
[21:10] you might be uh you you know there's
[21:13] something wrong in your life and yet
[21:15] that that same rock is still here today
[21:17] to satisfy that that holy thirst that
[21:20] god has given to you to quench that
[21:22] thirst if you'll just if you'll just
[21:24] reach out and let him let it open up
[21:26] your heart and let that thirst be
[21:27] quenched
[21:30] now now
[21:31] the sixth one
[21:34] is a is a real interesting one
[21:37] because moses goes up
[21:40] now you think about what moses was doing
[21:41] brother brown said when he went to the
[21:43] to the top of that mountain god gave him
[21:45] the seals that you think why why would
[21:48] the ten commandments be the seals
[21:49] because the ten commandments is the
[21:51] revelation the revelation of jesus
[21:52] christ
[21:53] written on those tables of stone as is
[21:55] the attributes that will be manifest
[21:57] that god wanted to manifest in a
[21:59] believer that you're going to worship
[22:00] the lord like god with all your heart
[22:02] that you're going to put god before
[22:03] everything else that you're going to
[22:05] honor your father and mother you're not
[22:06] going to tell lies and you're not going
[22:07] to steal and and all the other things
[22:09] that are written in the ten commandments
[22:11] and and so moses went up there and and
[22:14] to get to to get the seals and he came
[22:17] down from the mountain with the seals
[22:18] and nobody wanted to have none of it
[22:21] they would rather have their golden calf
[22:23] they rather have their own ideas than
[22:26] than what god had that what the god's
[22:28] prophet had gone up to the mountain to
[22:30] to receive from the actual finger of god
[22:33] himself
[22:34] that god wrote with himself by himself
[22:38] the message that he came down from the
[22:39] mountain with
[22:41] and the lord said unto moses go get thee
[22:43] down for thy people which thou brought
[22:44] us out of the land of egypt have
[22:46] corrupted themselves
[22:48] they have turned aside quickly out of
[22:49] the way which i commanded them they have
[22:51] made them a molten calf and have
[22:53] worshipped it and have sacrificed there
[22:55] unto and said these be thy gods o israel
[22:58] which have brought thee up out of the
[23:00] land of egypt think about what a
[23:01] statement to say that this not not the
[23:04] god of abraham and isaac and jacob but
[23:06] this golden calf is how we came out of
[23:09] egypt
[23:10] what a statement
[23:14] and this is the first time that moses
[23:15] intercedes for the people now we'll read
[23:17] through that that
[23:19] god god gets to he as as they provoke
[23:22] him and say and say that they disbelieve
[23:24] he they get they get him to a place
[23:26] where he's just ready to destroy them
[23:29] all and start over again
[23:31] and every time he does that then moses
[23:33] and brother brown explained that moses
[23:35] is his is christ in moses and it's
[23:38] stepping in the way and saying don't
[23:41] what what are all the other nations
[23:42] going to think if you you've promised
[23:44] that you were going to take us to the
[23:45] promised land and if you wipe the slate
[23:47] clean
[23:48] then then everybody's going to look at
[23:50] you and think that you're not fulfilling
[23:51] your word
[23:53] and and and each time moses would step
[23:55] in in the way and intercede for the
[23:57] people
[23:58] right you think again about the grace of
[24:00] god
[24:03] and number seven
[24:05] they started complaining about the manna
[24:08] and when they compl after eating all
[24:09] that you know you think the bible tells
[24:11] us what manna looked like it was it was
[24:13] the size of a coriander seed and it
[24:15] looked like vidalia which is a little
[24:16] brown and like kind of a little bit
[24:18] glossy or whatever so it was real small
[24:20] in other words it was hard to get you
[24:22] had to go out and do some work for it
[24:25] and so just like us we've got we kind of
[24:27] got to go through our bible and spend
[24:29] some time uh you know the preacher
[24:31] preaches hard things and and you don't
[24:33] understand it and and then you got to go
[24:35] home and and meditate on it and and pray
[24:37] about it and and they got they got a
[24:39] little bit frustrated with the process
[24:42] every day they had to go out and they
[24:43] couldn't even keep any over they had to
[24:46] go out the next morning because if they
[24:48] kept any over then it would get it would
[24:49] get rotted up and so they had to keep
[24:52] doing it every day and just like us
[24:54] we've got to keep going
[24:55] we can't get stagnant we got to keep
[24:57] going back
[24:58] and and reading and studying you know i
[25:01] was i was talking to my wife the other
[25:02] day about how when you when you the
[25:04] message is so supernatural
[25:06] and and i'm about to wrap up here
[25:08] when you read a message
[25:10] the first time you read it you think
[25:12] okay well that kind of makes sense but
[25:13] then you go back again oh i missed that
[25:16] the last time and then you go back again
[25:18] and oh there's something else that
[25:19] unfolds and it just keeps unfolding and
[25:21] unfolding because it's supernatural
[25:24] and you can't get frustrated like these
[25:27] did and stop and say i'm so tired of
[25:29] this word the musicians can go ahead and
[25:31] come forward i'm so tired and and when
[25:33] moses got to hear and how they were so
[25:35] tired he said
[25:36] lord just kill me
[25:39] he said if thou deal thus with me i ca
[25:41] kill me i pray thee out of hand
[25:44] if i have found favor in thy sight and
[25:46] let me not see my righteous richness and
[25:49] this is when god put his spirit that was
[25:51] in moses on the 70 men and and kind of
[25:54] gave him a little respite gave gave the
[25:56] seven gave him 70 men to help him out a
[25:58] little bit
[26:00] god bless you
