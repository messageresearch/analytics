[0:00] this week they're still in celebrating
[0:01] that anniversary
[0:03] so I hope they saw the mystery on the
[0:06] missing hundred dollar bill
[0:11] I don't know
[0:14] today I want to continue my son and I
[0:16] was working on last time on uh
[0:19] dog door and a door but I'm in the keys
[0:22] along uh
[0:24] but mostly I want to go in the I'm a
[0:26] Good Shepherd today so I'm gonna speak a
[0:28] little bit on my door and then I'm gonna
[0:30] build a good shepherd
[0:31] so we're going to read psalms 23.
[0:54] I preacher usually use this on uh like a
[0:57] funeral so we're gonna
[1:00] we're gonna use this so we can take that
[1:02] what we're talking about the Good
[1:04] Shepherd
[1:06] the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want
[1:10] you make me to lie down and bring
[1:12] pastures he leaded me beside the Still
[1:15] Waters he restores my soul he needed me
[1:18] in a path I watched his nest for his
[1:20] name's sake
[1:22] he although I walked with a belly in the
[1:24] shadow of a death I will fear no evil
[1:29] but thou art with me thy right and thy
[1:31] staff comfort me
[1:33] thou prepares the table before man
[1:35] president of my enemies the anointed my
[1:38] head with oil My Cup right over
[1:41] surely goodness and mercy shall follow
[1:44] me all the days I'm alive and I will
[1:46] dwell in the house of the Lord
[1:48] forever
[1:51] David was a David was a shepherd and God
[1:54] made him a king there's a lot of
[1:56] like Moses he was a shepherd He
[1:58] addressed that people under Egypt
[2:02] he says that our fear no evil for thou
[2:05] are with me
[2:07] why greater to see that see me that he
[2:09] is in the world
[2:26] foreign
[2:34] Greek artists I just can't think of the
[2:38] man's name at that time but he had spent
[2:40] practically a lifetime painting this
[2:43] picture and you see
[2:45] before it can be hung and the Hall of
[2:47] Fame has to go through the Hall of
[2:48] critics first
[2:50] any picture you must do that he must
[2:52] space the critters
[2:54] now this picture as the artist painted
[2:56] when he went to the hall about critics
[2:58] they could find nothing wrong
[3:00] and finally a great credit came up and
[3:02] said there's one thing wrong with your
[3:04] picture he said it's true Jesus with a
[3:07] lantern is hand coming by night and the
[3:10] Darkness of sin you say that's good his
[3:13] expression with the expectation of
[3:15] somebody to come to the door when he's
[3:18] knocking
[3:19] you say that's wonderful and looked up
[3:22] upon his spirit and he's longing to hear
[3:25] from the inside
[3:27] but he says sir there is no latch on the
[3:29] door if he
[3:31] become how could Jesus get in because
[3:33] there's no latch on the door
[3:37] oh said the artist that I painted those
[3:39] for the last on the inside Jesus cannot
[3:42] come in just by his will it's got to be
[3:45] your
[3:46] your will to let him in
[3:48] he said Lord
[3:51] stand at the door knock and marry him in
[3:53] or here
[3:54] my voice and come in let me in I will
[3:57] come in I will stop with him
[4:00] of course just remember can you hear me
[4:05] but who is any greater than Jesus and he
[4:08] is turned away from more doors and all
[4:10] the dictators and kings and politics of
[4:12] the world
[4:13] say yes I am I stand at the door and
[4:16] knock If any man will hear my voice and
[4:19] open the door I will come and I will
[4:21] serve with him he said his little knocks
[4:24] that we get at the door many times Jesus
[4:26] knocks it a heart store
[4:28] that's where the church is today those
[4:30] little knocks you feel it no doubt right
[4:34] now what is it is Jesus trying to come
[4:36] in gain answers to your heart
[4:39] the door he just wants to talk to you a
[4:42] little while
[4:44] I just just don't want to Jesus don't
[4:47] want that he wants to give you something
[4:49] that's the reason not he's got something
[4:52] for you there's nothing that could be
[4:54] greater than what is going to give you
[4:56] the holy spirit is wanting to give you
[4:59] eternal life
[5:02] he said as we look and see the cause of
[5:05] judgment forming to hear science set is
[5:07] three minutes till midnight and praying
[5:10] to
[5:11] those minutes are gone that was several
[5:14] years ago so where are we now
[5:19] he said we must welcome him Lord will
[5:21] come into my house if there's anything
[5:23] if there's anything in here that you
[5:25] want help yourself
[5:27] he said I'm yours you're mine you honor
[5:29] me the great king the Cradle of heavens
[5:32] and earth that's not at my door
[5:35] I want you to come in Lord be my Lord
[5:38] pick me may you do me anything you want
[5:41] to any bad thing that's in me discover
[5:44] every secret that's in my heart go in
[5:47] every door search me out Lord see what's
[5:50] wrong with me and whatever is wrong show
[5:53] me Lord throw it out the door
[5:55] I want you in here I welcome you and to
[5:58] be my Lord God I haven't got that
[6:01] blessing Lord bring me now
[6:04] making my Lord I'll never open
[6:07] the door to him if he can't be my Lord
[6:10] I just don't want him to be my savior if
[6:13] he can reward
[6:15] because everybody wants to see them but
[6:17] they don't want to lower they want
[6:19] something that they can escape all the
[6:21] damnation of health and then they can
[6:23] live any way they want to or they want
[6:25] to
[6:26] you know let's just walk around the
[6:28] village or the heart will be stand with
[6:31] me another 10 minutes
[6:33] let's walk around the heart just a
[6:35] minute the first thing is going to human
[6:37] heart on the right side as you go in as
[6:39] a little bit older there it's called my
[6:42] private life now you don't want nobody
[6:44] fooling in that not if you want to do
[6:47] anything that's my business
[6:49] I'll join the church I'll go down there
[6:51] but preacher don't you tell me what I
[6:54] got to do
[6:56] now I know the Bible says that but I
[6:58] don't believe it oh Lord see now you
[7:01] think Jesus will ever stay in a heart
[7:02] like that certainly not it counts him to
[7:05] be Lord
[7:09] and that the private life oh that's a
[7:11] great thing now you know we want I want
[7:13] private life
[7:15] so do we want a social drink with a
[7:17] neighborhood that's our business if
[7:18] we're a woman who want to cut our hair
[7:20] that's what that's our American American
[7:22] privilege you want to wear shorts that's
[7:25] our business well that's true if we want
[7:28] to take a social drink and we want to
[7:30] let our wife do that you ain't got no
[7:33] business saying one word to us but the
[7:37] gospel says don't do it now whose word
[7:39] is right you see God's word is right
[7:43] say oh sure we want and we want Jesus
[7:46] turned it we think we got him
[7:48] all like that but if I wander if that
[7:52] Rapture could pass and we we left alone
[7:55] one day then one or whatever it's all
[7:58] that come by real
[8:01] but real secretly you know and that's
[8:04] what it's coming like a thief in the
[8:06] night 99 out of every half a million
[8:10] every million will never know the
[8:12] Rapture takes place you'll be gone and
[8:15] they won't even know nothing about it
[8:18] Jesus said so so that makes it right
[8:20] seed certainly put calm like a thief in
[8:23] the night
[8:39] now I want to go on a message why it had
[8:41] to be Shepherds uh because remember kind
[8:44] of like a Christmas message he talks
[8:46] about when Jesus was born and stable and
[8:49] why it had to be Shepherds goes up
[8:54] and all the civilizers whatever we don't
[8:56] accept them that way
[9:11] on the bottom of the Schofield Bible
[9:17] Matthew 18 10.
[9:24] if you haven't talked about it
[9:26] after 1810
[9:29] .
[9:34] that's chapter 10 I'm sorry chapter 10
[9:36] at the bottom
[9:45] I don't know
[9:50] you'll notice
[9:53] you said that Shepherd or Governor has
[9:56] three aspects as a good shepherd
[9:58] he said he gave his life for the Sheep
[10:02] John 10. 11. he's there for the door by
[10:06] which
[10:07] If any man Enter he shall be saved
[10:11] this answer Psalm 22 he is the great
[10:14] Shepherd brought again from the dead
[10:18] Hebrews 13 20 to care for and make
[10:22] perfect sheep
[10:24] he's a sheep Shepherd who is coming in
[10:27] the glory to give cross a reward to the
[10:30] faithful Shepherd
[10:41] okay
[10:49] Jesus said bye all you have given me I
[10:52] have lost none brother man said he said
[10:55] she keeps getting out if the shepherd
[10:58] loves his sheep he will bring one of his
[11:00] legs so he don't get out anymore that's
[11:03] my God if we go astray he might have to
[11:06] put and they put him
[11:07] to put us into desperation and come
[11:10] back to God
[11:32] in the message why it had to be Shepherd
[11:35] girlfriend said I wonder if you've ever
[11:37] had the privilege of talking with a
[11:39] Shepherd or being with one and well if
[11:43] you would uh don't like to say it
[11:45] because of my remark I'm fixing to say
[11:47] that the world but but the shepherd
[11:50] stage with the Sheep so much
[11:52] that until he even laughs like the Sheep
[11:55] he talks like the sheep and smells like
[11:57] the Sheep that's right because he's been
[12:00] a sheep that's all he knows it's a sheep
[12:03] now the medicated word of the truth when
[12:07] these Shepherds humble uneducated men
[12:10] what an honor I feel like it is to the
[12:13] shepherd to receive the message of a
[12:15] newborn sheep
[12:17] you come to nothing else but a Shepherd
[12:20] that's why he was born in a stable and
[12:23] night and a house sheep are not born in
[12:25] the house but I think decorated
[12:27] hospitals see they're born and they're
[12:29] born in the fields there's a reason he
[12:32] was there to cover it you cannot make
[12:35] the Sheep walk the gangway to the
[12:37] slaughter did you know all that in the
[12:40] slaughter yards they had to go it needs
[12:42] the sheep and when he gets up to where
[12:44] the killing place is he
[12:46] jumps out and lets the Sheep go on the
[12:49] cheek has to be led
[12:51] he can't lead himself so therefore it
[12:54] had to be
[12:56] Shepherd coming for their sushi
[12:59] when they found that God they extracted
[13:03] me for their messenger said he would be
[13:05] and when they found this message
[13:07] the message or the measure and the major
[13:10] exactly where the angel said it would be
[13:20] you know the herdsman that Jesus chose
[13:21] when he was here in order to hurt his
[13:24] sheep
[13:25] love those meet Peter more than these
[13:29] yes Lord go live
[13:32] feed my sheep and the Bible said the
[13:34] fear was an ignorant and learned man
[13:37] still choosing Shepherds
[13:41] but the Shepherds fell completely and
[13:43] he's in that place with God's lamb any
[13:46] good trip or does the same thing when a
[13:48] Good Shepherd told his sheep can see the
[13:50] word of God
[13:51] made plan and Vindicated what he
[13:54] promised to do this Shepherd's right at
[13:56] home I don't care what anybody else says
[13:59] there's God's promised in it
[14:01] and he did it
[14:15] he said through all the scriptures your
[14:17] adventure has been represented through
[14:19] Shepherds and sheep that's right he all
[14:21] agreed to that point it was the Shadows
[14:24] you can shadow in a tight and anything
[14:28] I never had seen my hand and I looked
[14:31] down here in my handshadowed and I see I
[14:34] had five fingers I would know that it
[14:36] was reflecting the negative it was
[14:38] reflecting and positive and that's why
[14:41] the message always come to Redemption by
[14:44] sheep
[14:45] because from the very beginning it was
[14:47] sushi and by Shepherd there he revealed
[14:51] himself all was shadows and kite
[14:55] he said now let us look at the beginning
[14:57] Adam and Eve standing there in the
[14:58] presence of God to hear his message to
[15:00] them
[15:01] they had read about along the skin a
[15:04] sheep the first message was ever heard
[15:06] was given over the top of the Dead
[15:09] Chef's King cheap skin and got his slew
[15:13] and wrecked Adam and Eve and had after
[15:15] they tried to make their own religion
[15:17] out of siblings it wouldn't work
[15:20] she sacrificed had been instituted for
[15:23] atonement since the very beginning
[15:27] he said now the prophets the Old
[15:29] Testament great themselves in sheepskin
[15:31] we know that
[15:33] signifying that faith in his word with
[15:35] the common coming perfect land
[15:43] he said now we're going to find a way to
[15:45] come to Shepherd than either sheepy is
[15:48] helpless with either Shepherd too
[15:50] to guide them
[15:52] the Sheep is perfectly helpless he
[15:55] cannot go by himself that's the reason
[15:58] God liking his believing children unto
[16:01] sheep they got it to be guided I watched
[16:03] what's going on don't get to go we'll
[16:06] walk you to the slaughter dance
[16:09] his son the holy spirit that guide us he
[16:13] is our guide not some man made first man
[16:16] by god-given first man who treat the
[16:19] Sheep upon food
[16:30] okay
[16:31] God was training Moses to be a to be a
[16:35] Shepherd to bring his people out of
[16:36] Egypt
[16:39] but everyone said that he asked Moses uh
[16:41] Moses where are you going he said I'm
[16:43] going to I'm going to over Egypt to take
[16:46] over with a stick in his hand
[16:48] so he picked up his uh wife Sephora and
[16:52] Milo and his sons and went over to Egypt
[16:55] to take over
[17:01] now what they did he do by The
[17:03] Shepherd's death not a textbook not a
[17:06] theology she always idea of a shepherd's
[17:08] death we're coming to it in a minute at
[17:11] Shepherd's dead he did it not a
[17:13] denomination prayer book by Shepherd's
[17:15] dead
[17:16] Shepherds arrived died and his sheep
[17:18] making the way clear as they went
[17:20] towards that promised a word in the land
[17:23] he said what a beautiful thing that is
[17:25] today that Shepherd's day of the day
[17:27] guiding his cheek to the promised man
[17:30] bypassing all the Theology and
[17:32] everything else of this world and the
[17:35] things of the world
[17:36] and the denomination of everything
[17:38] opening up the way and providing his
[17:41] work to be the truth the shepherd's
[17:43] death going ahead and order the same
[17:46] Shepherd's death that was guiding the
[17:48] Sheep do you believe that he's certainly
[17:51] didn't guide the Sheep he delivered them
[17:53] out of Egypt with that staff and his
[17:55] hand you could say more about it but to
[17:58] hit the highlight
[18:00] he said he got his sheep and send
[18:02] judgment upon the rejection of the
[18:04] Saints death that he came at blessing to
[18:06] one became a curse to the others the
[18:10] same Waters I know Noah's preaching to
[18:13] save him condemned the world
[18:16] the same stuff that let Israel to the
[18:18] promised land from Land gosh who refused
[18:22] to follow the prophet Shepherd that's
[18:24] right to come and stick a judgment
[18:33] not to all that all As We Know Israel
[18:36] did not receive the prophet Shepherd's
[18:39] word Allah Israel did not receive it I
[18:42] noticed he was complaining oh honey it
[18:45] was perfect and the Miracles he was a
[18:47] great fellow but when it came to this
[18:49] message that was different all great
[18:51] science
[18:52] follow a new message coming we know that
[18:55] in the wilderness there's complain in
[18:57] the wilderness they die by the thousands
[19:00] frankly there was only two of them that
[19:02] ever went to that was saved out of a two
[19:05] and a half million
[19:07] two out of two and a half million
[19:11] that's a lot
[19:18] saying God that Moses broke up come over
[19:21] Moses and proved by Phil apart that he
[19:24] was Jehovah that was maybe most of the
[19:27] God was in his Shepherd prophet
[19:40] that secret that she could have been in
[19:42] God's delusion all these years covered
[19:45] by his right hand Jesus said the great
[19:47] Shepherd took up himself out of guilt
[19:50] for us Isaiah 53 6 said he was wounded
[19:55] for our transgressions he would lose for
[19:57] our iniquities the chastisements that
[20:00] our peace was upon him with his stripes
[20:03] we are healed The Secret of God's
[20:05] healing made in the Muslim like Jesus of
[20:08] God he was on the right hand of God
[20:11] that's the only sheep that held
[20:15] that's the only sheep that held and he's
[20:17] losing the secret that's the reason that
[20:19] four Shadows of it that could always be
[20:21] a sheep the first was the Sheep the last
[20:24] was a sheep that's the reason I had to
[20:26] come to a Shepherd to know how to take
[20:29] care of his sheep you get it notice he
[20:32] was wounded for our transgressions Bruce
[20:35] for our iniquities the chastise mess of
[20:37] our peace upon him
[20:41] said my great Shepherd was smitten the
[20:43] great Shepherd Prophet when he was being
[20:45] smitten back there and said it is
[20:48] finished
[20:49] and that minute as soon as the shepherd
[20:51] was then it was over
[20:53] sin and settled there was no more sin
[20:55] they were clean the penalty was paid he
[20:59] Believers whose names were written in
[21:01] the Book of Life predestinated from
[21:03] their foundation of the world it was
[21:05] finished the very minute that Jesus said
[21:08] it was finished you that great Shepherd
[21:10] had come for his sheep
[21:12] it was Spanish
[21:14] that right hand was pulled from his
[21:18] version of spirit
[21:19] Now Easter he returned
[21:22] raise it up again to the bosom and
[21:24] extended to the down to you and I in the
[21:27] fallen on his work to redeem us back to
[21:30] the original Garden from which Saint
[21:32] took us from
[21:33] the hidden secret that his great heart
[21:35] was revealed by a prophet Shepherd
[21:38] he was revealed revealed by Shepherd
[21:41] Prophet Shepherd
[21:44] same men and women God promised in the
[21:46] last days that he for our spirit upon
[21:50] affairs he probably saying that baptism
[21:53] of the Holy Ghost and you call it right
[21:55] without spot a wrinkle he promised to do
[21:58] it he'll do it
[21:59] don't listen to the darling Shepherd
[22:01] they'll need you astray the Holy Spirit
[22:04] and Shepherd to teach you she conclude
[22:06] from his word
[22:08] he had always come by the shepherd He Is
[22:11] Our Shepherd listen to him you are the
[22:13] Sheep of his bowl in the order you're
[22:16] here his voice not what somebody else
[22:18] says you hear what he says as transposed
[22:21] you know nothing about
[22:29] well Moses uh
[22:32] take the people that are easy they
[22:34] recall that people have got and until
[22:36] they came out then they will call the
[22:39] Church of God it means they called out
[22:41] ones
[23:02] that was a Shepherd too and he has a
[23:05] mixed multitude and um
[23:08] believe and make believe it's
[23:09] unbelievable just like Moses did
[23:13] he had a next multitude and only only
[23:16] two made it out of the million or
[23:18] whatever
[23:21] they say we have to make sure we receive
[23:23] enough
[23:39] next time I'll try to bring something
[23:41] new what were you reading out of there
[23:44] what brother Brandon would have been
[23:46] reading that on there the last one
[24:01] um
