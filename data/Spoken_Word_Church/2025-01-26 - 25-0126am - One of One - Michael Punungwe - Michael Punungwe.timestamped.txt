[0:54] guide us in this day Lord and give us
[0:56] Clarity on your word in your PR name of
[0:57] Jesus Christ I pray amen amen
[1:03] amen John chapter 4 starting at verse
[1:08] 4 and he and he must needs go through
[1:13] Samaria then cometh he to a city of
[1:15] Samaria which is called s SAR near to
[1:20] the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to
[1:22] his son Joseph now Jacob's Well was
[1:25] there Jesus therefore being wearied with
[1:28] his journey s sat thus on the well and
[1:31] it was about the 6th
[1:33] hour there cometh a woman of Samaria to
[1:36] draw water Jesus saith unto her give me
[1:39] to drink for his disciples were gone
[1:42] away into the city to buy meat then
[1:44] saith the woman of Samaria unto him how
[1:47] is it that thou being a Jew askest drink
[1:49] of me which I'm a woman of Samaria for
[1:53] the Jews have no dealings with the
[1:54] Samaritans Jesus answered and said unto
[1:57] her if thou knewest the gift of God and
[2:01] who it is that saith to thee give me to
[2:04] drink thou wouldest have asked of him
[2:07] and he would have given the Living Water
[2:10] I pray today we have the revelation of
[2:12] the gift of God and as a says who it is
[2:15] that sayith unto thee that's that's the
[2:17] revelation of the gift of God in verse
[2:21] 11 the woman saith unto him sir thou
[2:24] Hast nothing to draw with and the well
[2:26] is deep from Once then hast thou living
[2:30] water and of course Jesus here is he's
[2:34] he's not talking about the literal water
[2:36] but he he's he's talking about living
[2:37] water which is a a spiritual thing and
[2:40] he speaks like this a lot and there's
[2:41] many moments where you know Jesus is
[2:44] speaking and people seem to
[2:45] misunderstand what he's saying because
[2:48] you know they're more focused on the
[2:49] natural aspect and and simply similar to
[2:51] the disciples and how they're confused
[2:53] when he's talking about leaven and
[2:55] they're talking about bread and or the
[2:56] The Parables he would speak in they're
[2:59] they're they're often you know kind of
[3:00] questioning what what is he talking
[3:02] about and they're they're missing the
[3:03] Revelation and similar the woman here
[3:05] she's having the same issue where he's
[3:06] speaking in a certain way he's really
[3:08] speaking of the spiritual things of the
[3:10] deeper things and she's missing it
[3:12] because she's more focused on the
[3:13] natural
[3:14] aspect and and the purpose of him
[3:16] speaking this way he doesn't he doesn't
[3:17] speak without purpose he doesn't speak
[3:19] to confuse us but the purpose that Jesus
[3:21] speaking this way is really to call us
[3:23] to a higher level of Consciousness cuz
[3:26] we must become more spiritually minded
[3:28] than Earthly minded so he's trying to
[3:30] get us to to to a revelation to to to
[3:34] think lot not about bread you know not
[3:36] about wheat and tears and and and those
[3:38] things but really to understand what
[3:39] that means in the word and you know we
[3:42] can do our best to to live a good life
[3:44] but if we ignore the spiritual realm
[3:46] those evil spirits will inevitably
[3:48] consume us and will be help us to defend
[3:50] ourselves because our war is not with
[3:53] flesh and blood but it's with
[3:54] principalities and spiritual wickedness
[3:56] and you can't fight a war if you don't
[3:58] have the appropriate Weaponry for that
[4:00] war and you see this pattern throughout
[4:02] all of history you see man will make uh
[4:05] if if if your enemy has tanks you need
[4:07] to have your own tanks if your enemy has
[4:08] fighter jets you need to have your own
[4:10] fighter jets if you have a n they have a
[4:11] Navy you need to have a navy and and we
[4:13] see what's happened uh with you know
[4:14] when the atomic bombs were dropped now
[4:16] now every major superpower is going to
[4:19] have their own you know form of that so
[4:20] you you know that when you were in a war
[4:23] when you're in Warfare you need to have
[4:24] the appropriate Weaponry for that war
[4:27] and if we are to fight a spiritual war
[4:29] we cannot fight it with natural weapons
[4:31] we'll lose that war every time so that's
[4:33] what Jesus is always speaking in these
[4:35] ways and it might seem confusing
[4:36] sometimes and he's talking about you
[4:38] know the seeds and he's not talking
[4:39] about Farmers you know but and you have
[4:41] to get past the the metaphor the parable
[4:45] and then really get to the the deeper
[4:47] understanding of um of what he's trying
[4:48] to tell you and he's trying to give you
[4:49] these these weapons to to fight the
[4:52] spiritual battle that we're inevitably
[4:54] called to fight as
[4:55] Christians so and whenever Jesus is
[4:57] speaking this way you know it confuses
[4:59] people but he's trying to build their
[5:01] spiritual awareness to fight that
[5:03] spiritual battle because you really
[5:05] can't you can't defend yourself with the
[5:07] sword unless it's the sword of the
[5:08] spirit and you can't you know defend you
[5:11] can't you know fight with a shield
[5:13] unless it's the shield of Faith so you
[5:15] need you need those spiritual
[5:17] weapons and you'll notice that when you
[5:19] try to fight those those spiritual
[5:21] battles with natural weapons you'll lose
[5:23] almost immediately because if somebody
[5:25] you know is upset with you and you don't
[5:27] acknowledge or recognize that Spirit of
[5:29] anger then you are then going to react
[5:31] in anger and now you've both lost that
[5:33] spiritual battle now the spirit of anger
[5:35] is on you so you've lost that battle but
[5:37] if you if you understand the spiritual
[5:38] battle if you can look past the person
[5:40] and the situation and you can look to
[5:42] the spirit and say you know I see that
[5:44] person is upset they're angry but I'm
[5:45] not going to get upset with them and
[5:48] then and then and then now we're both
[5:49] consumed by the spirit but I'm going to
[5:51] I'm going to react with charity and
[5:53] kindness and patience and meekness and
[5:55] and and then you know you'll be able to
[5:56] preserve yourself from from losing that
[5:58] spiritual battle
[6:00] because you're going to lose that you're
[6:01] going to lose that battle if if you if
[6:03] you if you because you know they say uh
[6:05] misery loves company and we know that's
[6:06] true because brother brandom would speak
[6:08] of how he would Minister to spirits and
[6:11] then he'd say one spirit is trying to
[6:12] call out to another one to get help and
[6:14] that's misery that's misery wanting
[6:16] company that's that's that angry person
[6:18] you know people don't want to be angry
[6:19] by themselves they just look crazy so
[6:22] you can't be angry by yourself you often
[6:23] times if someone's angry at you and you
[6:25] just speak in a calm the demeanor though
[6:27] you'll see them also calm down as well
[6:29] cuz they they don't it's hard to be
[6:31] angry when someone's not angry with you
[6:33] so it's it's that it's that misery
[6:35] wanting company it's that Spirit wanting
[6:37] you know calling out for help you know
[6:39] and to see see if they can get a rise
[6:40] out of you and see if you'll lose that
[6:41] spiritual battle but if you react if you
[6:43] see the spirit and you react with
[6:45] weekness and and
[6:46] gentleness you know maybe the other
[6:48] person won't always calm down but you
[6:49] can preserve yourself from losing that
[6:52] spiritual
[6:53] battle and verse 12 art thou greater
[6:57] than our father Jacob which gave us the
[6:59] well and drank thereof himself and his
[7:01] children and his
[7:02] cattle Jesus answered and said unto her
[7:05] whosoever drinketh of this water shall
[7:08] thirst again but whosoever drinketh of
[7:11] the water that I shall give him shall
[7:13] never thirst but the water that I shall
[7:15] give him shall be in him a well of water
[7:18] springing up into everlasting
[7:21] life and I really pray that's the
[7:23] testimony of every believer here that
[7:25] you know we maybe we had Earthly desires
[7:27] before and and we tried to fill our
[7:29] thirst with with with with something
[7:30] else but once you come here this is it
[7:32] this is the this is this is the end goal
[7:33] you've arrived when you finally get a
[7:35] revelation of the word and Jesus Christ
[7:37] and and the Bible and and the prophet
[7:39] and all these different things this is
[7:40] this is this is the satisfaction that
[7:42] you've been missing in your life and
[7:44] that you're not thinking about going
[7:45] back you're not you know once you really
[7:46] have a revelation of what this is you
[7:48] know that's the point of no return
[7:50] because there's nothing else for you in
[7:51] this life on once you really realize
[7:53] what this is there's nothing else for
[7:55] you in this life and you'll never even
[7:57] think about looking back not like Lot's
[7:58] wife not for anything not for your
[8:01] family Jesus said you must hate your
[8:02] family hate your friends you have to
[8:04] hate everything else and it's not
[8:06] necessarily A hate but it's you must
[8:08] prefer Jesus to everything else you must
[8:10] you must desire him more than you desire
[8:13] anything else more than your family more
[8:15] than your friends more than your loved
[8:16] ones more than anything on this Earth
[8:17] more than any money any any any power
[8:19] anything you could obtain you have to
[8:21] want that more amen that's why Jesus was
[8:24] able to overcome you know when Satan
[8:26] tried to tempt him with the things of
[8:27] the world and it's like it's silly
[8:30] really because it's once you have a
[8:32] revelation of what this is it's like
[8:33] whatever is on this Earth is just is
[8:34] meaningless so so you know it's like
[8:37] that song says you know it all it all
[8:39] grows dim in the light of his glory and
[8:41] grace so that should be our that should
[8:43] be our testimony and and the living
[8:46] water that Jesus is trying to offer this
[8:48] woman he's under the spiritual water of
[8:50] that that springing up into everlasting
[8:53] life that's the water he's trying to
[8:54] offer her and that's the water I pray
[8:56] that we've all received of today so
[8:59] verse
[9:03] 15 the
[9:07] woman 15 the woman say saith unto him
[9:10] sir give me this water that I thirst not
[9:13] neither come hither to
[9:16] draw Jesus saith unto her go call thy
[9:18] husband and come hither the woman
[9:20] answered and said I have no husband
[9:22] Jesus said unto her thou Hast well said
[9:25] I have no husband for thou Hast five
[9:27] husbands and he
[9:30] he whom thou now Hast is not thy husband
[9:33] and that sayest thou truly the woman
[9:36] said said unto him sir I perceive thou
[9:39] art a prophet our fathers worshiped in
[9:41] this mountain and you say that in
[9:43] Jerusalem is the and you say that in
[9:45] Jerusalem is the place where men ought
[9:47] to worship Jesus saith unto her woman
[9:49] believe me the hour cometh when ye shall
[9:52] neither in this mountain nor ye at
[9:54] Jerusalem worship the father you worship
[9:57] you know not what we know what we
[10:01] worship for salvation is of the Jews but
[10:04] the hour cometh and now is when the true
[10:06] worshippers shall worship the father in
[10:08] spirit and in truth for the father
[10:10] seeketh such
[10:12] worship such to worship him and I love
[10:15] that scripture you know he sees
[10:17] um that shall worship the father in
[10:20] spirit and truth and it goes back to
[10:21] that uh Jesus speaking in the way that
[10:24] he speaks because even brother brandom
[10:25] said you know or if believe the uh the
[10:27] Bible says God is a spirit so he must be
[10:28] worshiped spirit and truth and brother
[10:30] Brandon will refer to that scripture and
[10:31] say that's why we need to raise our
[10:33] spiritual awareness that's why we need
[10:34] to set our mind on Heavenly things
[10:36] because as God is a spirit needs to be
[10:38] worshiped in spirit and in truth you
[10:39] can't just worship Him in your own
[10:41] natural means and and the way that you
[10:43] think you should be worshiped but it has
[10:44] to be in spirit and in truth it has to
[10:47] be his spirit and make sure that that's
[10:49] the have the right Spirit on you when
[10:50] you
[10:50] worship and 24 God is a spirit oh there
[10:55] it is God is a spirit and they that
[10:58] worship Him must worship him in spirit
[10:59] and Truth the woman saith unto him I
[11:02] know the messiah's come cometh is come
[11:06] he will tell us all things Jesus saith
[11:07] unto her I that speak unto thee am he
[11:11] and upon this came his disciples and
[11:13] marveled that he talked with the woman
[11:15] yet no man said what seekest thou or Why
[11:19] th talkest thou with
[11:20] her and this is I'm sure it's some
[11:23] familiar scripture to most of us but one
[11:25] of the reasons I I really enjoy this
[11:27] story is believe it highlights the
[11:30] humility of Christ and not only did he
[11:32] descend into human flesh but then he
[11:34] also descended even further to talk to a
[11:36] woman who was completely lost and sinful
[11:38] and five different husbands and
[11:39] committing adultery in the way that she
[11:41] was living and a Samaritan nonetheless
[11:45] and then he descends even further you
[11:46] know when he when he goes to hell and
[11:47] sets the captives free and and he he
[11:49] he's never he's never you know too high
[11:52] Mighty to descend to those who need it
[11:53] and those who need help and even to this
[11:55] woman you know it doesn't matter if
[11:56] they're uh what their condition is he
[11:59] willing to descend to where they are and
[12:01] that's why we know when the Bible says
[12:02] you can't escape the love of God we know
[12:04] that's true because we see Jesus
[12:06] embodying every ounce of that scripture
[12:08] you know when you you can escape the
[12:09] love of God you see where this woman was
[12:11] in her life and and first he's a
[12:13] Samaritan and he's a Jew and then on top
[12:16] of that you know she's she's living the
[12:18] way she's living and even you know
[12:20] people who aren't maybe even maybe the
[12:22] Romans who who weren't who were
[12:24] worshiping pagan gods would even
[12:25] wouldn't even want to deal with someone
[12:27] who was as adulterous as she was but
[12:29] Jesus was willing to to come down and
[12:31] minister to her and you know I wish I
[12:34] wish we as people could sometimes see
[12:37] people the way God sees them and to
[12:39] really see the soul of a person you know
[12:41] because brother brandom said that a soul
[12:42] is worth 10,000 worlds so you know
[12:46] imagine if I had a bar of gold maybe and
[12:48] and I'd offered it to people and and
[12:50] it'd be hard to stop people from trying
[12:51] to rush and try to get to that bar of
[12:54] gold but if you imagine you know 10,000
[12:56] planets made of pure gold and to imagine
[12:59] that that much gold and that much value
[13:01] is it within an individual soul and and
[13:04] we just walk past that every day you
[13:06] know or or like the Pharisees and
[13:08] disciples sometimes we we tend to look
[13:10] at the natural and we miss the spiritual
[13:12] and sometimes you know we look at
[13:13] worldly people and then we see tattoos
[13:15] and piercings or we see a pride flag and
[13:17] we deem those people as Unworthy of our
[13:19] time but maybe if we could see see past
[13:22] those things if we could see past the
[13:24] blind beggar if we could see past the
[13:25] prostitute or the Publican if we could
[13:27] see you know that there's a soul there
[13:29] that's thirsting for something you know
[13:31] there's thirsting for everlasting life
[13:33] and then then Jesus wouldn't then we
[13:34] wouldn't fear you know speaking to
[13:36] someone the way Jesus was wasn't afraid
[13:38] to speak to this woman no matter how low
[13:40] she was he wasn't afraid of that because
[13:41] he could see past her condition he could
[13:43] see her soul and he could see the value
[13:45] in that so if we could just see the
[13:47] value in the S Souls the way that Jesus
[13:49] could and you know we could in that way
[13:52] be the salt of the earth and and and and
[13:55] be able to minister to people if we
[13:56] weren't so you know we don't want to get
[13:58] too high- minded like the Pharisees were
[13:59] where where they just want to pray loud
[14:01] prayers in the synagogues and they want
[14:03] to wear you know fancy clothes and say
[14:05] that how blessed they are of God but
[14:07] just to be able to Humble enough to
[14:09] minister to anyone regardless of their
[14:12] condition you know and and I try to
[14:14] emphasis to this I try to emphasize this
[14:17] to my students a lot where um
[14:19] emphasizing the value of where where of
[14:21] a person an individual and where that
[14:23] comes from and that it's not in our
[14:24] appearances you know it's not in how
[14:26] fatter or skinny someone is or how
[14:27] taller short or rich or poor any of
[14:29] those things but it's really in the soul
[14:31] of an individual and and on this Earth
[14:34] You Get so distracted by the physical
[14:35] things and and all the fancy things but
[14:37] really we need to look at the the worth
[14:39] of an individual soul and that that's
[14:41] how God sees them it's not by their
[14:43] outward appearance but it's by the soul
[14:44] and if that Soul can be saved you've
[14:46] saved 10,000 worlds and that's an
[14:48] amazing
[14:49] thing and to have that understand that
[14:52] you know even when you're dealing with
[14:53] your brothers and sisters and and if
[14:55] there's disagreements you know
[14:56] understanding that you know the love
[14:57] should still be there for the love for
[14:59] for that person and the love for for
[15:00] their soul even if there's a
[15:01] disagreement on on Doctrine or whatever
[15:03] the case may be you should always want
[15:05] that person you know the best for that
[15:07] person and they want the the best for
[15:08] that person's soul and brother brandom
[15:10] said you know our first love should be
[15:12] God and then our second love is our
[15:14] fellow man and then we're like number
[15:15] third or fourth or wherever wherever
[15:17] else we are but it should always be
[15:19] looking to to God and to to other people
[15:21] and our fellow
[15:22] men and I'll call the musicians up as I
[15:26] end on this thought and I I just had to
[15:29] stop with the with the Valentine banquet
[15:31] coming up and maybe think about years
[15:33] ago when our church took a trip to Ohio
[15:35] and brother Isaac had this this nice car
[15:38] and apparently you know it was a it was
[15:40] special because it was they only made so
[15:43] many I think there was like a thousand
[15:44] or something they made but they only
[15:45] made so many cars and it's a lot you see
[15:49] that a lot in marketing in the world you
[15:50] see like they have a there's a big deal
[15:52] about exclusivity if if something feels
[15:54] rare you know they want to they want to
[15:55] Market that it's it's limited edition
[15:57] they really want to Market that cuz they
[15:59] only made so
[16:00] many and you know and I just thought
[16:02] like if the think that people can value
[16:04] a car that that's one in a thousand you
[16:07] know where a few models were made but we
[16:09] take for granted people that exist on
[16:10] Earth who are one of one you know cuz
[16:12] God doesn't remake Souls you know even
[16:14] if you could find someone identical to
[16:16] you if there's identical twins people
[16:18] who look exactly alike they talk alike
[16:20] they act likee they dress alike they
[16:21] have two separate Souls that's right no
[16:23] matter what and God doesn't remake Souls
[16:25] there so every individual is one of one
[16:28] and you know there will never ever be
[16:29] another you it doesn't matter you know
[16:32] how alike someone is every individual is
[16:33] one of one and to think that God you
[16:36] know could take two PE completely Unique
[16:38] Individuals and then put them together
[16:40] in in a marriage and think about how
[16:41] special that is and you can take someone
[16:43] who's one of one and can take someone
[16:45] else who's one of one and then put them
[16:47] together and I hope everyone who's
