[0:00] our 32 parts on the hill 70 weeks and
[0:05] for those of you that just came in does
[0:06] anybody have a Virgina must not be earth
[0:09] is anybody help hey seventy weeks of
[0:11] Daniel book that they borrowed no I kind
[0:17] of figured see the Regina are our it's
[0:21] either Regina are the West maybe they
[0:23] they've got sister Cletus book that she
[0:27] loaned us so we need to try to get it
[0:28] back so what we're doing now is if we're
[0:32] trying to now begin into the Seventh
[0:35] Seal and we last Sunday we touched on a
[0:39] few things and we started reading the
[0:43] Bible so we're going to go back again
[0:45] anybody seen this and go back to Isaiah
[0:49] 29 because the seals you see I have
[0:52] seven seals it must come everything must
[0:54] come from the Bible right everything
[0:58] must come from the bottom so God talks
[1:01] about a seal all the way through the
[1:03] Bible we didn't even hardly get into the
[1:05] New Testament last Sunday so we're going
[1:07] to try to skip there real quick I was
[1:09] there 29 and some of the others and then
[1:12] we'll go down into the New Testament
[1:15] alright and then we'll read in
[1:20] Revelation all right everybody got that
[1:23] everybody out there you don't have to
[1:25] get out of their way not you read around
[1:26] here I said it speaking what and the
[1:29] vision of all is becoming to you as the
[1:32] words of a book that is sealed okay this
[1:37] Bible is sealed to the world but yeah
[1:41] you can physically open it right many
[1:44] denominations who preach out of this
[1:46] millions of denominations will preach
[1:48] their variation of scripture out of this
[1:51] one book but if it's not a true
[1:54] revelation from God if they did not come
[1:56] from the mind of God
[1:58] this to me came this is the mind of God
[2:00] made my offense cry then the books
[2:02] clothes I don't care how much they read
[2:04] it the book is closed okay but now to
[2:08] the bride of Jesus Christ in this end
[2:12] time we have so much revelation to where
[2:15] we know that the books open we can read
[2:18] what's in the book we can read what the
[2:19] mind of God has already told us and we
[2:22] can see that though down through the
[2:24] ages I told many times good have such
[2:27] humans tonight and then mr. of our
[2:29] generation a sweetheart so anyway play
[2:37] the lakes energy the lazy people to do
[2:43] it no don't relate on the coffee jazz
[2:48] that she's dog sitting for my grandbaby
[2:50] while they're gone on vacation anyway
[2:55] now this seals in the old time you
[3:01] remember they had a scroll at a piece of
[3:04] paper with me what to do I find one
[3:10] remember there was not booked during
[3:12] even I was this time it was not a book
[3:14] but form came into being way like in the
[3:18] fifteen hundred thirteen fourteen
[3:20] fifteen hundred book like this right
[3:22] because even Paul Paul read the Old
[3:27] Testament scroll when it is rolled this
[3:32] is the scroll bad example but but most
[3:34] of the time it was so big though at to
[3:36] roll when we can then roll it together
[3:39] seal it unseal it unfold it and read it
[3:44] but there was no ready to read what with
[3:46] inequality phobic you can't read you
[3:51] know there's nothing to read you can't
[3:52] read you can't make out anything but
[3:54] once the book is open and unsealed you
[3:57] can read it all right and what God's
[4:00] been trying to do though he's been
[4:01] trying to unseal it and man that's tried
[4:03] to steal it back up like I said about
[4:06] the mouth guards been trying to open the
[4:09] Bible since Genesis the revelation of
[4:13] the Bible but every time God gives a
[4:16] revelation it looks like man takes close
[4:18] to the book back up alright but there
[4:22] had to come a group of people like we
[4:24] were talking about last night Bible
[4:25] study like Louie said there's a time
[4:28] that you know back in the early 1900's
[4:32] there was no thought of an astronaut
[4:34] going up in the outer space that was
[4:35] just you can't even get off the ground
[4:37] you know the Wright brothers came and
[4:39] flew a couple of hundred feet you know
[4:40] and then the airplane came into being
[4:43] but no way could you bow them putting a
[4:47] man on the moon they did it you know and
[4:51] then in the 60s they'd about what they
[4:53] did they developed a way to go then come
[4:56] back all right so now since we're now in
[4:58] the astronaut age we ought to be able to
[5:01] see into the beyond we ought to be able
[5:03] to open the book right right but there's
[5:08] only one person that's really worthy
[5:10] will read it a little pile of
[5:11] Revelations five
[5:12] there's one word you go lamb but now if
[5:14] you're born again someday where is that
[5:16] loud as he is heaven is that lambo we
[5:20] under somewhat know the lamb is here
[5:24] when I accept Jesus glasses my sacred
[5:27] the lamb came to redeem me and live in
[5:31] my soul all right okay so as he did that
[5:35] then the lamb is here then revealing the
[5:39] mysteries of God all right tell me all
[5:42] that came into anybody borrow sister
[5:43] Cletus we got to find her seventy weeks
[5:45] of Daniel book didn't even borrow under
[5:47] you have one thing Joe then even one day
[5:49] we have one year give them get I keep
[5:53] having a stack those shoots you ask
[5:54] about it it's kind of my fault that they
[5:59] got gone I guess I got to keep on watch
[6:00] ghost evoking anyway we'll talk about
[6:03] the scroll so the scroll was rolled up
[6:07] alright and seal it had to be unsealed
[6:14] so that we could read what would then
[6:16] know like i said before you can
[6:17] physically read this Bible and it's only
[6:23] just the stories it is a good story book
[6:26] its history is a good history book it's
[6:28] a good story book and it really tells
[6:29] you how to live life and actually I
[6:31] constitution which tomorrow would you
[6:33] lie before our Constitution was written
[6:35] according to the bottle we hold these
[6:39] truths be self-evident that all men are
[6:41] created equal and all those things in
[6:44] and all of our laws of the land was
[6:46] shadows I said used to now used to
[6:49] shadow of the bottle the head that they
[6:52] took it out of the Bible right I took it
[6:56] out of the Bible to write our loss for
[6:58] us to live by but there's a deeper
[7:00] meaning to this man has just unfold it
[7:04] to a place where they can physically
[7:06] read it's like we we pray and we sing
[7:10] open the eyes of my heart Lord I want to
[7:12] see you now today and from now on I want
[7:16] when you see that word seed could
[7:17] understand because basically you can
[7:20] read that Bible every day you laugh and
[7:22] dying
[7:22] help you can see what's written in that
[7:25] bottle but if you understand what's in
[7:28] the Bible you understand what's written
[7:31] there and some man must teach you will
[7:34] read it here even eyes that some men
[7:36] must teach you you can't get it for
[7:38] yourself you cannot get it by yourself
[7:42] you're not a prophet okay you can't get
[7:46] it by yourself so you have to depend on
[7:48] a possible profit pastors teachers in
[7:50] the bank with for the perfecting of the
[7:52] same alright so when we talk about the
[7:55] seven seals it is a mystery it's been
[8:00] hid from centuries and ages and no man
[8:03] on that and there there's no person in
[8:06] the grave today except William Brown
[8:08] that knew what those fields were right
[8:11] right think about that there's no person
[8:15] since the beginning of time except Jesus
[8:17] Christ that he is the seal do we have to
[8:19] take him you know take him out of the
[8:21] picture he's he's not up he's not in the
[8:24] grave he's with he's out he broke that
[8:28] seal and came out of the grade and he
[8:30] broke that Roman seal that they put on
[8:32] the up on the grave and that's what they
[8:36] uh they used to do if you watch that new
[8:39] movie and I think you should risen where
[8:44] it takes and they put a piece of wax on
[8:49] them on the rock they steal it up they
[8:52] steal this up with a band and they take
[8:55] a piece of wax and the old-time take a
[8:56] piece of hot wax our paraffin and they
[8:59] would drip it on there then they would
[9:01] take a Cygnet or a ring and they would
[9:04] imprint that we you didn't open it until
[9:07] he got to its destination ok and that's
[9:10] what God's done to us by the Holy Ghost
[9:12] he has sealed us could his seen that on
[9:15] it but now if he sealed us then who does
[9:22] the book
[9:24] we are the book God didn't see us and
[9:28] then sell us out of the book no he
[9:30] sealed us because we are the book you
[9:34] better find yourself in the Bible you
[9:37] better find yourself in there well my
[9:39] name's not in there yeah it's written
[9:40] all in if you'll read it and see I
[9:43] understand what it's talking about how
[9:46] the Bible's written a Christian alright
[9:47] alright so now let's look at Isaiah 29
[9:51] and see what they talk about sealed we
[9:53] keep going down through here we're going
[9:55] to get into Ephesians and I want you to
[9:58] understand and remember this is probably
[10:01] one of the most simple understandings if
[10:04] you really see of the body brother
[10:09] branham preach dot is simplicity first
[10:12] to help you to understand that even the
[10:15] most illiterate person that can't even
[10:17] read can listen and hear what the Spirit
[10:20] says to the church what the Bible says
[10:23] we got to hear what the Spirit says to
[10:24] the church and hearing what the Spirit
[10:26] says to the church then you get all the
[10:29] written part plus the unwritten part
[10:32] because remember we're supposed to read
[10:35] where between the lines for those of you
[10:37] that are new I know my wife because
[10:42] we've been man for 37 years coming up
[10:44] right she can write me a letter and I
[10:47] know if a something wrong brother Danny
[10:48] just by the way she writes that letter
[10:50] you would too because you know these
[10:52] characters risking of your wife will see
[10:54] God wrote us a lot of letter so we're
[10:57] supposed to look between the lines and
[10:59] see the park you know she says
[11:00] everything's fine i'm doing well but
[11:02] right in between there I know she's
[11:04] sitting down she's missing me and we're
[11:06] you know we're missing each other come
[11:08] hey do you have a sister Cletus they can
[11:13] send at least book did you borrow again
[11:15] tomorrow one okay come on in now see if
[11:19] you can finally we're falta de sol
[11:24] everybody get what we're talking about a
[11:25] seal a seal shows a finished work
[11:30] alright but now let me explain something
[11:33] to you I asked this question in mobile
[11:37] Jesus died at Calvary right to take away
[11:41] all the sin of the world and when he
[11:44] rose he conquered death hell in the
[11:46] grave right broke the seal people feel
[11:50] God Christians I'm gonna talk about
[11:53] saturday i don't know about christians
[11:55] kept on dying why there was never enough
[11:57] of that man to come back until that
[11:59] jesus christ the headstone there was
[12:01] never enough word that that man took
[12:03] over in another dimension he sent back
[12:05] the Holy Ghost to what to seal man we're
[12:10] going to read it Ephesian breathing out
[12:12] of the Spirit of God read not the horse
[12:14] breeding I can't remember now where you
[12:17] are sealed see on so what God does he
[12:21] takes and seals you but what does he
[12:23] still he steals your revelation your new
[12:28] birth is a revelation I'm telling you
[12:31] more than ever in studying these
[12:32] dimensions and all you do not get a
[12:34] revelation in this dimension this
[12:37] dimension is is negative everything in
[12:41] this dimension should have never
[12:42] happened hello everything in this
[12:48] dimension LifeLight matter should have
[12:50] never happened we should have been in
[12:53] that seventh dimension there should have
[12:55] been no fall you understand but there
[12:58] had to be because God is a savior he's a
[13:00] healer he had to manifest those
[13:02] attributes but what are we going back to
[13:05] one dimension heaven on earth not heaven
[13:10] up yonder some way if we get a real
[13:13] revelation that means that that
[13:15] revelation came from somewhere in
[13:17] another dimension faster than this one
[13:19] into this dimension and that's God
[13:23] people because the only God can give a
[13:24] revelation same can give you an
[13:27] understanding but he cannot give you a
[13:31] revelation a man so God has to come down
[13:35] even through the fourth dimension God
[13:37] has to come through that dimension
[13:41] ah yeah you listen to tapes don't you
[13:43] you look at sermons on the internet it's
[13:45] on wireless words that come from fourth
[13:47] dimension right but there's a lot of bad
[13:51] things in the fourth dimension to but
[13:52] God comes through that dimension cuz he
[13:54] can't come in this dimension personally
[13:56] right now they mad but he can send
[13:59] messengers into this dimension to give
[14:02] us an understanding he brought the Holy
[14:03] Ghost when the Holy Ghost fell into that
[14:05] Pentecost it came from another dimension
[14:07] another world a supernatural world it
[14:11] was super it came from super doubted
[14:14] natural so it became supernatural it
[14:16] came down and filled the people with the
[14:18] Holy Ghost and made him supernatural
[14:20] beings but they died they were killed
[14:24] they all ones that ran the upper room
[14:26] almost were all murdered or murdered
[14:28] except for John the Revelator so he
[14:31] could write in the book of Revelation so
[14:34] the seal seals you there's only one seal
[14:37] but it takes seven seals to complete the
[14:41] plan of redemption and what we were
[14:43] talking about you say why it takes six
[14:46] but it takes that Sabbath to seal it all
[14:49] together because Jesus Christ is that
[14:52] seal right remember we've come a day and
[14:55] seventy weeks six seals finishes
[14:56] Redemption 6-volt purpose finishes
[14:59] Israel's Redemption so six the six seals
[15:02] finishes the redemption of the bride and
[15:03] then we move over into that seventh
[15:06] dimension where Christ can come back
[15:07] here the only reason he'd come back here
[15:09] is because we bring that dimension here
[15:11] we break the barrier down okay all right
[15:15] we'll get into that week on my
[15:16] dimensions later on in another sermon
[15:18] but let's read out there and the vision
[15:20] of all it will talk about vision now
[15:21] where do you get a vision the title of
[15:24] my sermon is going to be television
[15:26] television television television because
[15:32] jesus said to over when it come down the
[15:33] mountain see what tell the vision dunno
[15:36] land til the Sun I'm a beer in hand soap
[15:38] television television is telling you
[15:40] that God is working in another dimension
[15:43] Colette pictures coming through this
[15:45] room right now but brother Brown said
[15:47] your body is not able to pick it up
[15:50] because it's
[15:50] receptor but if you put a television
[15:53] right here trying to know with one of
[15:54] little ears and pick up on everything is
[15:56] going through this room so the vision of
[15:59] all is for coming to you as the words of
[16:01] a book that is sealed no understanding
[16:05] because remember you can't read a book
[16:06] when it's sealed the only way you can
[16:10] read a book that sealed this be the book
[16:15] and then be the book because from the
[16:20] outside it's sealed everybody all right
[16:23] that's why this is going to be this is a
[16:25] secret and only certain ones will get
[16:28] that part when they become the book
[16:30] which men deliver to one that is learn
[16:33] saying read this I pray thee and he said
[16:35] I cannot for his steel down through the
[16:38] ages that's what man has done man has
[16:40] come and sit what does this mean well we
[16:44] don't know but what does this mean what
[16:46] we don't know what does this mean we
[16:49] don't know hardly give their own
[16:52] interpretation we didn't come from this
[16:53] in the beginning right that's just my
[16:56] father son Holy Ghost baptism sure it's
[16:58] written around here Matthew 2819 going
[17:00] to all the world preach the gospel
[17:01] baptizing name of the Father name of the
[17:03] son named logos that's about the father
[17:06] is no name subs not named Holy Ghost is
[17:10] not named ten days later was was Peter
[17:13] so confused that ten days later he stood
[17:15] up on a bedpan coughs an act to 32 38
[17:18] said repent be baptized name Jesus
[17:20] Christ now that is a name and the Bible
[17:25] says all heaven has a name Jesus Christ
[17:28] isolation but now remember we had to
[17:31] have that open to us because remember
[17:33] that was sealed in the denominational
[17:35] world where ninety-nine percent of the
[17:37] denomination believe in father son Holy
[17:39] Ghost is to baptism now brother after
[17:41] that come from the pits of hell why so
[17:44] false doctrine it comes from the fourth
[17:48] dimension to but it came from a demon it
[17:51] didn't come from God right that's pretty
[17:55] hard to understand the father son Holy
[17:59] Ghost being the baptism in
[18:01] that title is false so it is anything
[18:05] false is the devil if you don't have you
[18:08] don't have degrees of falseness in God
[18:12] all right he's all true everything else
[18:15] is a lot okay so and the business of all
[18:19] coming to use the word a book that is
[18:21] seal which men delivered to one they
[18:23] just weren't saying read this I prayed
[18:25] the end he says I count for his seal and
[18:27] the book is delivered to him that is not
[18:29] learn saying read this operated princes
[18:31] no learn or for the Lord said for as
[18:35] much as this people draw near me with
[18:36] their mouth and with the lips do honor
[18:38] me but have removed their heart that's
[18:40] the other thing so they removed their
[18:44] heart what the inner being that's where
[18:47] God wants to talk to you listen this
[18:50] thing can fool you but when you get down
[18:52] into that soul they see the faith or
[18:54] doubt there's no gray area in there
[18:56] right let's say about water baptism if
[18:59] it's revealed to you there's no other
[19:00] way you can be better the other one is
[19:03] false you can't have true and false
[19:05] together all right these people draw
[19:08] near me with their mouth and with a lift
[19:09] you honor me but have removed their
[19:11] heart far from me now where does God
[19:14] give you a revelation in your brain
[19:16] never it has to go through your brain to
[19:21] process it because you're human right to
[19:24] process it it has to go through your
[19:26] brain but it has to drop down into that
[19:28] not this heart like that says the
[19:32] thumping is it okay the heart your very
[19:36] core your real beating where you do all
[19:39] your real thinking the man because you
[19:42] know you got thoughts running through
[19:43] your head but when God brings a
[19:44] revelation if you're a Christian with
[19:46] dub range revelation you know where that
[19:47] came from because the devil can't bring
[19:49] your revelation and then but how to
[19:52] remove their heart far from me see God
[19:54] looks it to heart remember Satan took
[19:57] the intelligence God took the heart of
[19:59] man and their fear toward me is taught
[20:02] by the precept of men
[20:09] right there for me hold i will proceed
[20:12] to do a marvelous work among these
[20:14] people even a marvelous work in a wonder
[20:16] for the wisdom of their wise men shall
[20:18] perish and the understanding of their
[20:21] prudent man shall be hid I'm you keep on
[20:26] reading but let's go to I want to go a
[20:29] golden thread now brother Bob red and
[20:34] Jeremiah remember here Jeremiah let's
[20:37] just look around here real quick
[20:38] Jeremiah put the evidence and sealed it
[20:41] and he what'd he do he sealed it and
[20:45] where he put it and on earthen vessel
[20:50] now this is a literal story the Dead Sea
[20:54] scrolls were found in a in a earthen
[20:57] vessel they were finding the cat found
[20:58] in the cave in a pot they were speaking
[21:01] down in a pot just like this that
[21:04] Jeremiah talking about stealing and
[21:06] putting what did Jeremiah do like
[21:08] brother Bob said the other day a deed
[21:11] Jeremiah had indeed this property he
[21:13] knew he was going in captivity maybe we
[21:16] showed that damn 70 weeks now 70 years
[21:18] and the land wrestle God put them in
[21:20] captivity for 70 years right that's he
[21:22] seventy weeks of Daniel but when they
[21:24] come back out even though if Jeremiah
[21:26] died or whatever he knew and somebody
[21:28] knew that that deed what is this this is
[21:34] indeed this is your will this is the
[21:38] will of God right you have you will read
[21:41] every day you read your wheel every day
[21:44] and you see what God's going to give you
[21:46] sorry but so Jeremiah physically took
[21:49] the deeds of the property this is the
[21:51] physical story just disease of a
[21:53] property just like you and I would and
[21:56] we would go put them in the bank so okay
[21:59] something happened somebody would know
[22:00] they go to your deposit box take them
[22:02] out see this is updated 2016 bird but
[22:05] the about 2,000 BC this is their version
[22:08] they seal it up if I could read it with
[22:13] them and they put it in an earthen
[22:15] vessel what a pot put a lid on now
[22:18] update it to now well what's what's he
[22:20] talking about
[22:21] you're going to take the evidence of the
[22:22] purchase put it in an earthen vessel
[22:27] seal it put it in an earthen vessel this
[22:29] is the earthen vessel now you know as
[22:32] well as I do many times I've told you
[22:34] but God when we see the word when the
[22:38] word talk about Earth I don't think
[22:40] about the big ball that we're on right
[22:42] you are earth this is your this is where
[22:46] you came from you came from my desert so
[22:48] this is the earth gods talking about not
[22:51] so much the big ball that we're living
[22:53] them all right then jeremiah said man
[22:58] shall I feel for my answers God
[23:00] Evanescence Elam what he's talking about
[23:02] is when they come back out of captivity
[23:03] they can go and break open that right
[23:07] and say hey I own that property this is
[23:11] mine that's the same way God's doing the
[23:13] same thing if he steals your evidence up
[23:15] listen in earthen vessel anytime the
[23:18] devil comes all you gotta do is go this
[23:21] is my property it's not yours you don't
[23:25] have a title I have a title this is my
[23:28] title alright that same way what you're
[23:30] mine brother Bob did a real good job
[23:32] with that deal done hey man okay right
[23:37] then in the Book of Daniel will just
[23:40] read through these real quick and get
[23:41] down to the New Testament but the old
[23:43] Daniel shut up the words and seal the
[23:45] book even to the time of the end we told
[23:48] Daniel masiela once you rope and it will
[23:51] be understood at the time of the end
[23:53] well guess what this is the end so God
[23:59] is speaking of the people sitting in
[24:01] this room right now and then
[24:05] alright so now let's go right here now
[24:09] what did what did we're coming into the
[24:12] New Testament now so we know now that
[24:14] the New Testament the seal of the New
[24:17] Testaments what the baptism of the Holy
[24:19] go what happened right here now Romans 4
[24:23] who's he talking about Abraham Abraham
[24:26] received the promise but they were have
[24:30] got a evidence of the promise what a
[24:35] sign of circumcision a seal of the
[24:39] righteousness of the faith which he had
[24:41] yet being uncircumcised now listen we're
[24:47] all adults here Abraham was ninth well
[24:52] you'll understand for them Abraham was
[24:56] 99 years old he circumcised himself he
[25:03] must have believed something do you
[25:06] understand he physically circumcised
[25:07] themselves at 99 years old so that's
[25:11] that you say well that's carnal well
[25:12] that's the face he had god told him i'm
[25:15] going to give you a sign of circumcision
[25:16] you cut off the foreskin of you remember
[25:20] and that's going to be my sign to you or
[25:22] what is that a sign that's a sign of
[25:24] getting rid of this excess flesh that we
[25:26] have a man that all right you have to be
[25:29] a little carnal but the Bible mcneil
[25:31] gives us allegories that we have to go
[25:32] back but it was what it was a sale God
[25:36] sealed Abraham's faith with that
[25:38] circumcision and the Jews to this day to
[25:42] this day the Jews take that as a sign of
[25:45] Ben jus if you're uncircumcised remember
[25:48] remember if you was uncircumcised you
[25:50] couldn't even go into the temple you had
[25:53] to show yourself to the priest every
[25:55] time you walked in the temple because
[25:58] remember what he called the Paul brought
[26:00] Timothy or somebody into the temple and
[26:01] he was uncircumcised and they found out
[26:04] he was uncertain something that got all
[26:06] over him call or Peter one of the two or
[26:07] the call I think it was Paul Paul brings
[26:10] Timothy in and they start bickering back
[26:13] and forth
[26:13] when Paul comes up says look it's not
[26:16] circumcision and uncircumcision now as
[26:19] part of the flesh but it's the
[26:22] circumcision of the heart so you see how
[26:25] that revelation came from natural to
[26:29] announce a supernatural revelation the
[26:32] supernatural revelation is now is the
[26:34] circumcision of the heart not the
[26:35] circumcision of the flesh part of your
[26:36] body they have nothing to do with it
[26:38] nobody will remember it did at one time
[26:41] yeah we just rented it did it one time
[26:45] Abraham thought had so much faith in God
[26:47] he said I'm gonna do everything thought
[26:48] tells me today right so God honored that
[26:52] faith and he comes over into a place to
[26:55] seal of his the righteousness of the
[26:58] faith which he had yet being
[26:59] uncircumcised so he's uncircumcised then
[27:03] come under the circumcision and God
[27:05] honored that as a type of the hodo right
[27:09] all right then we going down a little
[27:12] bit further the left we got to get to
[27:14] Ephesians sometime today you can see
[27:19] second Corinthians 122 who has also
[27:21] sealed us and given the earnest of the
[27:24] Spirit in our hearts so now what is God
[27:26] talking about now what's Paul talking
[27:29] about Krakens this thing the new birth
[27:31] so the new birth is the seal that's why
[27:35] I'm brothers and sisters I want to
[27:36] really be going to be playing if you
[27:40] can't understand the Word of God you
[27:43] need the new birth because guns will
[27:46] honor that new birth by giving you a
[27:48] revelation sure there's going to be
[27:51] things that we can't understand alright
[27:52] there's going to be things that we just
[27:54] can't get that's why there's teachers
[27:57] and that's one of those preachers and
[27:58] that's why there's pastors and that's
[28:00] why there's a badge list and all these
[28:02] ones to come in to what all they do is
[28:05] is they give you a channel to work in
[28:08] cuz I can't give you a revelation but if
[28:11] God will come from that other dimension
[28:13] come into my brain my humor
[28:15] brain you say what you wanted in this
[28:18] human brain of mine some of you were
[28:20] shaking your head but if God comes into
[28:22] this human brain of mine with a real
[28:24] revelation and it's something that I can
[28:25] a conduit that I can get it to the
[28:27] people then that's God talking to you
[28:31] straight from the throne straight from
[28:34] that other dimension now if I bring my
[28:36] own idea I have took something in this
[28:38] filter and brought it down and
[28:40] interjected my own idea right right and
[28:44] that's false that's me and you know what
[28:48] if you're a born again Christian you
[28:49] can't see bit see you can't understand
[28:51] that it's my brother male said it's hard
[28:54] to preach the truth it's not hard to
[28:55] preach error they just preaching man
[28:57] just let her go let her rip you know but
[29:02] the breach the truth that I know what
[29:03] he's talking about because you gotta go
[29:05] there's so many avenues you gotta cover
[29:08] brother nails very good at it some
[29:10] creatures will just preach what they
[29:11] believe in boy just you know take the
[29:13] bulldozer and push push to treat it out
[29:17] of the way you know her brother Dale he
[29:19] go comes back and studies and he says
[29:21] okay can we save that tree can we move
[29:23] that bush you know what he's saying is
[29:25] he's taking all avenues because there is
[29:30] going to be there is once you preach the
[29:31] message there's always going to be doubt
[29:33] and fear and somebody else's done stay
[29:35] with what about right come on you do the
[29:39] same thing well what about this well I
[29:42] think if the Holy Spirit's here you'll
[29:44] answer every one of those avenues ready
[29:46] say and not saying anything against any
[29:49] other preacher but some don't clarify
[29:52] what they're saying that's why you need
[29:55] a pastor a pastor clarifies he has
[29:57] enough time to clarify you know you have
[29:59] you have somebody like brother Joel
[30:01] comes in and he put on my he lays and
[30:03] whole bucket on him and he leave we'll
[30:06] see it takes brother Dale them to come
[30:07] back around the Spirit of God working
[30:08] through all the ministry and not the
[30:11] jeweler appreciate saying wrong but I
[30:12] don't believe he ever has but he may
[30:14] mention something and then back off and
[30:17] go somewhere else we'll see that's an
[30:19] evangelist evangelist to me kind of
[30:20] stirs you up okay I guess
[30:23] to think and get you to you know
[30:24] thinking what's going on then it takes
[30:26] somebody like a pastor to come and serve
[30:28] the meal you know I can tell you about a
[30:31] good meal but if you ever have a servant
[30:33] to me i don't know if it's good or not
[30:34] but you serve it to me and i start
[30:37] eating it then that's the way it should
[30:38] be so now look he's sealed us and give
[30:43] us the earnest of the Spirit in her
[30:44] heart now let's get to Ephesian vision
[30:48] one that's where we want to get to we
[30:50] okay woke the little all right and
[30:54] whom ye also trusted after that you
[30:57] heard a word of truth so you've got to
[30:58] hear first faith cometh by and hearing
[31:05] by work so faith come you can't have
[31:10] faith in something you don't know about
[31:14] at least a little bit you may not have
[31:17] to have a total understanding but you
[31:19] got at least Abraham listen Abraham's
[31:23] walking through the world and he hears
[31:26] this voice that says get up and move
[31:34] Abraham's probably got a nice house he's
[31:36] got a good job he's living with his
[31:37] father in law you know knees or his
[31:40] father and he's making idols and he's
[31:42] making pretty good money you know he's
[31:43] paying his bill got a good car maybe up
[31:45] to and he's sitting there you know and
[31:48] this is cousin lots with him and there's
[31:51] a nephew lots with him and he's
[31:53] everything's fine one night this voice
[31:56] just says Abraham get up move
[32:03] your move so it goes in and tell sister
[32:07] Jim Jim we're moving tonight of course
[32:11] you have to duck frying pans coming when
[32:13] you say that so y'all kind of dug and
[32:18] Sarah was not a meat woman idol thing at
[32:21] the beginning you know so the one thing
[32:25] is we do have to believe something that
[32:27] we can't all the way see but you got to
[32:29] have an understanding Abraham Abraham
[32:31] had an understanding that that came from
[32:34] somewhere not natural that was a
[32:38] supernatural voice that spoke to him why
[32:41] you saying all this will listen to get
[32:44] them to get the full meaning of anything
[32:47] seals down 70 weeks whatever you must
[32:49] have faith and believe in what God's
[32:53] telling you take it back to the word
[32:56] take it back to the mirror if it fits
[32:59] into work that's why I said about Dinah
[33:00] 70 weeks we made it fit in the word if
[33:04] it fits in the word I don't care what
[33:05] anybody saying prophet priest our King
[33:07] all right I really don't because I put
[33:10] it in the Bible the Bible tells us I
[33:12] love what brother Ron said face final
[33:15] resting place is in the Word of God run
[33:18] not what anybody says out here because
[33:20] you can take the quote that brother
[33:21] Brent I'm sitting here and you can make
[33:23] it sound like you said this you make it
[33:25] sound like this you say how you know
[33:27] that how many different denominations
[33:29] we've gotten this message people saying
[33:31] brother BAM preach polygamy and preach
[33:32] this a preset fall he never preached
[33:35] that the Holy Ghost never will preach
[33:37] air never all right but just like Jesus
[33:44] you know big I don't know if you think
[33:48] about this real but how about if them if
[33:50] it broke down walked up today and said I
[33:53] eat my flesh and drink my blood or I'll
[33:55] have no part with you or you have no
[33:58] part with me and then you walked off the
[33:59] pulpit
[34:03] that's what Jesus did he stood up in
[34:07] front of a crowd and he said unless you
[34:08] eat my flesh and drink my blood you have
[34:12] no part with me and he never explained
[34:14] it he left remember they started
[34:16] murmuring and complaining in one of the
[34:18] world and what's going on would you know
[34:20] what he meant he waited to a Paul came
[34:22] over a little bit later the Holy Ghost
[34:24] in Paul says look eat my flesh communion
[34:30] drink my blood wine symbolic right so
[34:36] that's the way that brother branham I
[34:37] believe he hit to hide it from the wise
[34:38] and prudent he said some things they'll
[34:41] hard to understand but there's no
[34:44] confusion in the true Word of God no new
[34:46] heroes look at whom also you trusted
[34:48] after that you heard the word of truth
[34:50] the gospel of your salvation and him
[34:52] also after that you believe after that
[34:54] you believe not before after that you
[34:58] believe you were sealed
[35:05] because what births you the word is what
[35:08] gives you a bird so you must hold on to
[35:11] a part of the word that you've got and
[35:14] seal it in here once remember once
[35:19] you're sealed in your soul Satan can't
[35:20] get in sure he can beat at the door he
[35:23] cannot but he cannot get that seal off
[35:25] of it you know why he has no authority
[35:28] to take that seat see he has authority
[35:31] on this that's when he disputed last
[35:34] night we're talking about Moses you go
[35:37] over the book of Jude Satan is disputing
[35:40] with Michael about where they hid the
[35:41] body of Moses why because Satan has one
[35:44] thing this was born in sin and he has a
[35:49] little bit of a hold on it because we
[35:53] came the way that he interpreted to Eve
[35:55] and the gardening now we all come by say
[35:58] so this is one thing that the Satan has
[36:01] he has hey he beats this thing to death
[36:03] huh I don't know if he beats you but he
[36:05] beats me okay you were sealed with that
[36:08] Holy Spirit of promise which is the
[36:10] earnest of our inheritance until the
[36:13] redemption of the purchased possession
[36:14] now the purchased possession is what
[36:18] this Jesus at Calvary purchased
[36:23] everything but remember it can't be
[36:25] applied unless we what we gotta believe
[36:31] like rosedale's preaching now week in
[36:34] room who brains all that stand up that
[36:36] we did in our life god I like that song
[36:41] what sins are you talking about yeah you
[36:43] know you say God forgive me for you know
[36:45] doing that in 1985 and he's going I
[36:49] don't remember that right we can't let
[36:55] there's no way we can't keep asking God
[36:57] to forgive the same sin if you already
[36:58] forgive it to the first time not sure we
[37:01] know it say it knows it and say it makes
[37:05] you sure you don't forget it but God's
[37:07] already forgot that's where the seal
[37:10] come from this is what God is looking at
[37:12] not
[37:12] he's looking at this he's looking at
[37:14] that title deed right here the Inside
[37:17] Man which is the earnest of our
[37:19] inheritance well the Holy Ghost is just
[37:21] a nervous because it's working in your
[37:23] soul Holy Ghost is working in your body
[37:27] only through your body all right so this
[37:32] is not this one made by Holy Ghost
[37:33] that's why I said if we were coming the
[37:35] way we should have come this was what he
[37:36] would be made by the Holy go how was
[37:40] Jesus made house uses body made the Holy
[37:44] Ghost will overshadow thee that's what
[37:50] we should come to man you don't know how
[37:52] we come that's exactly which book come
[37:54] because that's what you think about
[37:55] power although the purchased possession
[37:57] unto the praise of his glory okay
[38:00] everybody got that so now just for a few
[38:03] minutes
[38:09] he's read this with everybody always go
[38:11] for different but it says grieve not the
[38:13] Holy Spirit of God whereby you are
[38:16] sealed unto the day of redemption
[38:20] alright you're sealed unto the day of
[38:26] redemption what is the day of redemption
[38:30] the day we take about a change and this
[38:34] man will not be overcome this this man
[38:40] inside will overcome this man and will
[38:43] have a body like his large body goes
[38:44] what happened to him he was human flesh
[38:47] Jesus was human flesh and he overcame
[38:50] all that and now here's a glorified by
[38:53] they went with us right but remember one
[38:56] thing you can't grieve the Holy go don't
[39:01] tell me yes you can if you never done it
[39:05] before if you don't do you may know how
[39:06] to hold you can't grieve something yet
[39:11] God yeah I'll grieve them before have
[39:16] you ever grieve you ever done something
[39:17] wrong and you just feel so bad about it
[39:19] and then you then you really don't
[39:21] repent for a day or two and you feel
[39:23] like you give you just you felt you go
[39:26] bar you lord well words he had brother
[39:30] Brown said he'll go out on a limb not
[39:31] gonna go out of you what you gonna do
[39:34] he's gonna withdraw his spirit from you
[39:36] just enough for you to say daddy I need
[39:41] you back he's not gonna wave if you'll
[39:44] never leave your internet you know you
[39:45] can't get the Holy Ghost and then lose
[39:47] it God's not an Indian giver he's not
[39:49] going to give you the holy ghost in the
[39:50] illusion now there's a big difference in
[39:53] having an anointing you can have an
[39:54] anointing and lose that
[39:56] you can come back loop that and come
[39:57] back to live that right conflicts was
[39:59] annoying everybody put Jesus on crops
[40:01] and he's going to go to hell for it I
[40:03] son I would say you would all right
[40:06] there biochem Annette go now I like this
[40:12] one right here I'm going to read this
[40:14] one then we'll go what's this

[40:39] that God knows who you are where you're
[40:42] at huh but i watch and let everyone that
[40:50] namath the name of Christ depart from
[40:52] iniquity now we're going to talk about
[40:55] the first seal and talk about iniquity
[40:58] what is iniquity iniquity is knowing to
[41:02] do better or going to do right and you
[41:05] don't do it that's right okay that's
[41:08] iniquity and we are a product of
[41:11] iniquity even you to do better but she
