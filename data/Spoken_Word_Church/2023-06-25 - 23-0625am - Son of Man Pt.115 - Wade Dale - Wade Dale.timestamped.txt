[12:33] prayer for him has been probably a year
[12:35] and a half maybe something like that but
[12:37] uh he had cancer the esophagus and they
[12:41] had to take his esophagus out
[12:43] and they had to reattach us
[12:46] stomach
[12:47] because he doesn't have an esophagus to
[12:49] attach it and he was really really bad
[12:52] and got really lost a lot of weight got
[12:55] real sick
[12:56] but uh kept a positive attitude he's a
[12:59] he's a Christian and he's just been
[13:02] having his faith in the Lord had a real
[13:04] positive confession the whole time and
[13:07] um
[13:08] you just took him took him a while to
[13:10] get over that but turned the corner done
[13:12] real well got back to work put on weight
[13:15] and everywhere he went he was out
[13:17] testifying what the Lord had done for
[13:19] him and
[13:20] a few months ago
[13:22] he said I just started to feel different
[13:24] said I didn't
[13:26] and he was afraid that the cancer had
[13:28] come back which
[13:29] he was telling me there was a there's a
[13:32] little test that they can do
[13:34] and then the test results your normal
[13:36] human should be somewhere around zero or
[13:38] close to zero
[13:39] but he said if that number gets up to 20
[13:43] he said they can tell but that number
[13:45] good up to 20 he said they can tell
[13:46] there's cancer cells there
[13:49] he went and had the test done
[13:52] and it was 668.
[13:56] but he said didn't lose his confession
[13:59] he said because the Lord brought him
[14:00] through the first time the Lord to bring
[14:01] him through again
[14:03] and so he's uh every time he gets new
[14:06] test result he brings them to me so his
[14:08] first one was 668 the next one was 354.
[14:12] the next one was 150 something
[14:15] and he brought me one the other day and
[14:17] it's down to 16.

[22:09] sometimes you do as brother Dales always
[22:12] said you kind of feel sorry for the God
[22:13] because but you know it was his choice
[22:15] it was his choice to be who he was he
[22:18] wasn't the anointed cherub he was going
[22:20] to be God's right-hand man and boy you
[22:22] see how that turned out
[22:24] his own will came apart came up and he
[22:27] iniquity was found in him so

[22:32] could that be the same with me and you
[22:34] because we'll look at today you don't
[22:36] want things for sure Satan can't
[22:39] condescend
[22:41] he's Hardy he wants to be on the
[22:44] mountain he wants the side of the north
[22:45] he wants to be God he don't want to be
[22:48] like God now he wants to be God he wants
[22:50] to sit on his own Throne have his own

[27:54] service and we will stay over the ones
[27:57] that want to stay over you need to let
[27:58] me know some of you already have there's
[28:01] a place called The Farmer's Daughter and
[28:03] it's a really good place to eat it's
[28:05] Amish owned Meat and three
[28:09] Tony's gonna love it this place is just
[28:11] good it's I'm talking about they take it
[28:14] from the field into the restaurant if
[28:16] it's you know during season but it's a
[28:18] real good place to eat but if you want
[28:20] to stay and eat after the service is
[28:21] over they've reserved a place for about
[28:25] 50 people in the back of the restaurant
[28:26] and you're sure welcome to come now
[28:29] remember the church will be paying for
[28:32] you rooms
[28:33] but you'll have to get your own
[28:35] transportation you can carpool together
[28:37] and your own food you shouldn't have to
[28:40] have too many meals outside of that
[28:43] and then your your gas in your meals
[28:45] you'll have to take care of all that so
[28:47] we sure do appreciate all of you that
[28:48] are going 53 that's pretty good like I
[28:51] said before brother Andre said oh bro
[28:52] wait we can handle a group
[28:55] I said we got 50 people coming he said
[28:57] oh bro wait we've only had a group to us
[28:59] is 10.
[29:02] I said well a 53 of Us coming so you
[29:05] better get you you know put your big
[29:06] britches on and and get the big mule out
[29:09] get the big horse out you know so but
[29:11] they're they're already working I talked
[29:12] about Andre yesterday they're they're
[29:14] already working and getting stuff ready
[29:15] to go so and we need to pitch in and
[29:18] help when we get up there it's not just
[29:20] a vacation time where we just go and see
[29:22] it no we need to pitch in and help them
[29:24] because they are a very small church and
[29:27] and we're bringing twice as many as what
[29:29] they have in church service so you know
[29:32] that's that's going to put a little
[29:33] strain on them but we sure do appreciate
[29:34] that we want to uh invite all of you to
[29:38] um talk to each other about who to ride
[29:40] with and different things and carpool
[29:42] together if you wish to
[29:44] but I do need to know if you're going to
[29:45] stay over for a farmer's daughter all
[29:47] right and and eat afterwards because we
[29:50] need to know the lady needs to know all
[29:52] right also remember Bethel Camp I think
[29:55] brother Ryan he talks those
[29:57] so low I can't hear him so you need to
[29:59] talk a little bit louder learn from your
[30:01] daddy okay
[30:02] but the Bethel can't remember go online
[30:05] and and please we want to participate as
[30:08] a church if you can take a couple of
[30:09] days off or see it in your heart to work
[30:12] on maybe a Saturday or a Sunday uh they
[30:14] need 40 people to help in the kitchen
[30:16] because they don't have 300 something
[30:18] kids but there'll be up 40 people in the
[30:21] kitchen because this year the camp
[30:23] they're at now or this year this year
[30:25] coming up no one helps in the kitchen so
[30:28] they pretty much got it all they don't
[30:30] have Camp kitchen help all right like
[30:33] they did at the other one but this one I
[30:36] know some of you already signed up to be
[30:37] counselors and different things but we
[30:39] want to support them we're actually
[30:40] probably the closest church that's
[30:42] affiliated with with with brother Jason
[30:44] Watkins we're the closest church to it
[30:46] up there in Travelers Rest just about an
[30:47] hour and 15 minutes from here so we can
[30:50] it's like four hours for them so they're
[30:51] having to haul all their stuff up there
[30:53] so let's kind of take the burden off if
[30:55] you see it in your heart go to Bethel
[30:57] Camp I think it's um Youth Camp Bethel
[31:00] Youth Camp
[31:01] go on Facebook you'll find it and
[31:03] there'll be a space there for you to
[31:05] sign up for kitchen help all right go in
[31:08] and put your name in it and uh and let's
[31:10] help them out okay I'm gonna try my best
[31:13] to be there maybe a day or two myself so
[31:15] also remember July 29th uh we're working
[31:19] on having a Saturday
[31:22] um singing and dinner on the ground
[31:25] I've talked to several people about
[31:27] coming we'll not discuss that now but
[31:29] but July 29th on Saturday at four
[31:32] o'clock
[31:33] and then about six o'clock we'll have
[31:35] some
[31:36] um maybe some soup and sandwiches or
[31:38] something like that and then we'll have
[31:40] another
[31:41] session of of testimony if you want to
[31:44] work on songs bring your instruments and
[31:47] we'll have a day of worship all right
[31:49] I'm going to try to get a brother to
[31:51] come which is a good singer and and
[31:53] never heard him preach before but I'd
[31:55] like brother
[31:56] um
[31:57] um brother Dwayne Jackson
[32:00] from Brother
[32:02] um
[32:03] Joe Greene's church I'm going to try to
[32:04] get him to come and Minister for us and
[32:07] he's also a very good singer so let's
[32:08] just keep that in prayer all right all
[32:10] mine's clear let's let's jump into the
[32:12] word of God we're still on the son of
[32:14] man I want to bring out something that
[32:16] that maybe we'll help each and every one
[32:18] of us today and we pray that that you'll
[32:21] pray for the ones that are sick
[32:24] that's just burdened on my heart the
[32:26] whole time whole weekend a whole week
[32:28] about people that are sick that can't
[32:29] get here so let's bow our heads dear
[32:33] Lord
[32:35] we've we've sung the songs we've we've
[32:38] done all the ordinances of the church
[32:41] Lord now father we bow our heads to ask
[32:44] you Lord to come Among Us in a special
[32:46] way
[32:47] bring your anointing Lord to each one of
[32:50] us
[32:51] just bathe us and saturate us with your
[32:53] Holy Spirit Lord
[32:55] may we feel your presence Lord and even
[32:58] if we don't we know the word has already
[33:00] been anointed
[33:02] father I pray that you would bless us as
[33:05] we speak your word Lord and as we hear
[33:07] your word father
[33:08] that you would be with each one that's
[33:11] in the sound of my voice Lord the ones
[33:12] on the internet the ones that are home
[33:14] the different ones that are that are
[33:16] clicking in father I pray this should be
[33:18] with them Father wherever they are be
[33:20] with the ones here in this building
[33:22] Lord ever forgive us of our sins Lord
[33:25] and let us be mindful Lord that you're
[33:27] always with us and you said you would
[33:28] never leave us and never forsake us so
[33:31] whatever we're going through today Lord
[33:33] you will be there with us just bless us
[33:36] now in a further on this service in
[33:37] Jesus name
[33:38] amen let's read our familiar scripture
[33:41] in the beginning was the word
[33:43] the word was with God and the Word was
[33:44] God
[33:45] and that word was made flesh and it's
[33:48] continuing to be made flesh I want us to
[33:50] see that that's a continuing that what
[33:52] didn't just happen 2000 years ago and
[33:54] gone bye-bye no it's happening like as a
[33:57] region met brother Brown said deity fell
[33:59] on the day of Pentecost and it's still
[34:01] falling down all right so we're going to
[34:03] believe that we call it the Holy Ghost
[34:04] but it is deity all right it's part of
[34:08] the deity of the what people call the
[34:10] Trinity or the godhead of father-son
[34:12] Holy Ghost all right that's what we're
[34:14] looking at we're not looking at three
[34:16] different people but we're looking at an
[34:17] anointing then we're looking at the Holy
[34:19] Ghost the Holy Ghost is not exactly an
[34:22] anointing in itself
[34:23] it's a person
[34:26] it's the birth part then you have
[34:28] anointings or or refillings or you see
[34:31] up here on the top of the pyramid we'll
[34:32] get to that so I want to kind of
[34:34] um what they always old expression I
[34:36] want to prime the pump get the pump
[34:38] prompt so you be thinking about that
[34:40] because the Holy Ghost fell on the day
[34:42] of Pentecost on a group of people it
[34:44] birthed them it went inside of them
[34:47] and they became different people
[34:49] and that's when the word of God became
[34:52] alive
[34:53] and flesh
[34:55] and dwelt among us and we beheld his
[34:57] glory the goal of the only begotten the
[34:58] father full of grace and truth you can
[35:00] go ahead and have your seat
[35:01] second Peter 1 verse 5 brother Louise
[35:05] did a great job today that's a good job
[35:06] man and he did I like it when people
[35:08] enjoy speaking I like that
[35:11] Peter says and besides this in other
[35:13] words besides what I just told you
[35:15] besides the new birth
[35:17] giving all diligence add to your faith
[35:19] virtue in the verse of knowledge and all
[35:21] these Temperance Temperance patience to
[35:22] patience godliness and the godliness
[35:25] brotherly kindness and the brotherly
[35:27] kindness charity and then as brother
[35:29] Louise said if these things be in you
[35:31] what and abound
[35:33] they will make you they will turn you
[35:36] into Jesus Christ and human flesh on the
[35:39] face of this Earth amen with the
[35:41] characteristics of God not just
[35:43] anointing you we'll talk about that in a
[35:45] minute but living inside of you that's
[35:47] the whole difference of a nominal
[35:50] Christian which can be anointed which
[35:53] can be an anointed one which can be a
[35:55] foolish virgin but they are just
[35:57] anointed by temporary anointing
[36:01] you and I are if you're born again today
[36:03] you don't have a temporary anointing you
[36:07] are the anointing you are part of that
[36:09] anointing that is falling and and and
[36:13] Joel promised it following All Flesh
[36:16] listen these people these singers
[36:18] They're rappers and all that they're all
[36:20] anointed they're anointed to do what
[36:23] they're going to do they have been
[36:25] anointed but remember it's a perverted
[36:28] anointing theirs is
[36:30] and it's something that comes on them
[36:32] and comes off of them as we're going to
[36:34] see in the Old Testament that's exactly
[36:36] what happened to that group of people so
[36:39] let's just remember that as we continue
[36:41] on Colossians 1 verse 21 to you that
[36:44] were sometimes alienated enemies in your
[36:46] mind by Wicked works
[36:48] you now has to be reconciled so we come
[36:50] to the New Birth we've been reconciled
[36:51] back to Christ and we don't have just an
[36:54] anointing like I said before we have
[36:56] that person inside of us then he's going
[36:58] to work itself out but you and I as
[37:01] human beings we need these different
[37:04] anointings I always enjoyed well I
[37:07] always enjoyed brother Homer anyway but
[37:09] all the times we were going to the camp
[37:10] over there in Alabama for about eight
[37:12] years General were counselors and and
[37:15] brother
[37:16] um he'd have brother Ron Spencer or or
[37:18] brother Danny steamman be up there
[37:20] preaching him and then when they get
[37:21] finished with the service and get ready
[37:22] to start praying for people brother
[37:24] Homer would step up he said okay now
[37:26] that now the anointing has changed see
[37:30] there was anointing of preaching brother
[37:31] Brown had an anointing of preaching why
[37:33] didn't he just flow right on in no he
[37:35] said hey I'm waiting on him while he was
[37:37] waiting on another anointing to come for
[37:40] the time
[37:42] so the anoint him for the time to pray
[37:44] for the sick is now on the preachers
[37:46] what brother Homer would say so come up
[37:48] let's come up for prayers for salvation
[37:50] the preaching's over seeds have been
[37:52] planted the ground's either good bad or
[37:54] indifferent all right let's you know
[37:57] what let's reap the benefits so the
[38:00] anointing of the prayer for the sick or
[38:02] the prayer for hey when you say praying
[38:03] for the sick we always think sick sick
[38:06] if you're not born again today you are
[38:09] sick your soul is sick that's right
[38:12] so we have a healing of the Soul first
[38:15] and then we have a healing of a body
[38:17] so in the body of his flesh through
[38:19] death to present you now he died we'll
[38:22] look at it just a few minutes
[38:24] and I'll get back to what I said because
[38:25] remember God is the only one that will
[38:28] come down to get us yes
[38:31] he's the only one that will condescend
[38:33] down to get man
[38:35] and not be selfish
[38:38] Satan will never condescend down
[38:41] all right never he's got a haughty
[38:44] Spirit a selfish Spirit we're listen
[38:46] where does all that contrary Spirit come
[38:48] from
[38:49] does the contrary Spirit come from the
[38:51] Lord it can't
[38:53] so everything that comes that way
[38:56] negative comes from the devil that's an
[38:59] anointing that he puts on us and as
[39:01] brother Branham says and we'll read if
[39:02] we get to it he he got a selfish Spirit
[39:05] on him
[39:07] the prophet
[39:10] if you'll read the message of the hour
[39:12] he was the most transparent man that
[39:14] ever lived never kept a secret thank God
[39:17] he'd tell you that he was almost a
[39:19] murderer that he was almost he almost
[39:22] committed suicide
[39:24] amen that that he's got complexes that
[39:27] he wanted to just go back in the woods
[39:30] and stomp out and the Lord said no no no
[39:32] that's not you that's not what I want
[39:34] from you this is what I want for you I
[39:36] want you to be with the people
[39:37] but he says here he has a selfish Spirit
[39:39] on it
[39:41] that's all of our problems
[39:44] but see Satan he doesn't want to deal
[39:46] with none of that he wants to stay up
[39:47] here but God's going to condescend down
[39:49] the Lord can do that he knows how to get
[39:51] low
[39:52] so that what he can take us High
[39:55] Satan just wants to stay up there and
[39:58] then drag you down that's what's so
[40:00] interesting he wants to be the God of
[40:02] this age but everything he touches he
[40:04] destroys
[40:05] amen and he's destroying us now in our
[40:07] body I was looking at at dad and the
[40:09] different ones you look at your body and
[40:11] our bodies are just dying
[40:14] there's nothing you can reverse at the
[40:17] moment
[40:19] because even brother Branham that
[40:21] brother down was 92 years old
[40:24] and brother and he was almost dying well
[40:26] he was dying in brother Brown announced
[40:28] that he would shake his hand again on
[40:30] the street or at the Tabernacle right
[40:32] remember that well whatever happened to
[40:34] brother now just that little piece got
[40:36] turned back
[40:37] whatever that was he still was 92 he
[40:41] still couldn't get out of a car very
[40:43] fast he still died all right but so now
[40:46] what we're looking at is the anointing
[40:48] on the end time today is that we don't
[40:50] have to fool with
[40:53] that kind of a devil and we can just say
[40:56] hey
[40:58] I like what brother Cauley he said don't
[41:01] tell people I died
[41:03] Christians can't die
[41:06] brother Carly died a long time ago when
[41:08] he was a young man young skinny guy used
[41:10] to come to church here where'd that man
[41:12] go he's still there
[41:14] he just protected by layers
[41:18] me too all of us hello somebody
[41:21] but he died a long time ago you can't
[41:23] kill a Christian
[41:26] if you'll see it that way
[41:28] so to present you whole now how we how
[41:30] do we see that way God came and did it
[41:33] yes yes
[41:34] so that we could see it that way say
[41:36] you're not going to ever let you see it
[41:37] that way he's always going to be the
[41:39] negative guy I always say you're hurting
[41:41] and you're dying and you got this and
[41:42] you got that
[41:44] just remember if you're a Christian
[41:46] today everything that Satan keeps on you
[41:48] is going to be heaped back on him amen
[41:51] it's going to be heat back on him and
[41:53] then we're going to live for an eternity
[41:55] in in in wonderful Bliss and guess what
[41:58] he's going to Bear every iniquity he's
[42:00] going to Bear every pain he's going to
[42:02] Bear every demon that was turned loose
[42:04] on us is going to be turned back loose
[42:06] on him
[42:08] right but now
[42:10] we're looking at the Lord and he's going
[42:12] to present you holy and unblameable and
[42:14] unreprovable in his sight look if you
[42:17] continue
[42:19] if you continue in the faith settled and
[42:21] grounded and be not moved away from the
[42:23] hope of the Gospel which you have heard
[42:26] and which was preached to every creature
[42:28] which is Under the Sun whereby Paul had
[42:30] been made a minister I was thinking
[42:31] yesterday
[42:33] you take all this group of ministers we
[42:35] got
[42:36] yeah we know brother Dale's not
[42:38] preaching now and he's going through
[42:40] some issues and and we're all praying
[42:42] that that will be resolved
[42:46] but think of the group of people
[42:49] might as well give her Rose or because
[42:51] I'm a recipient of it and so are you
[42:53] think of the people that that brother
[42:55] Dale that that he's he's I won't say
[42:58] that he spawned a group of people
[43:00] Underneath Him
[43:04] that really knows the truth of Daniel 70
[43:07] weeks the truth of the seals the truth
[43:10] of the different things and then now
[43:11] they're out and now then see they're out
[43:14] preaching
[43:15] you know they're out preaching the word
[43:18] of God so it didn't return void it
[43:20] accomplished all those years of breaking
[43:23] every a and in D and all sometimes we
[43:26] get bored and we fall back when we go to
[43:28] sleep and all these different things
[43:30] because he wasn't some fiery you know
[43:32] bringing it you know and and Hell firing
[43:34] Brimstone but he was planting something
[43:36] inside of a group of people
[43:40] all right and I promise you Brother
[43:42] Richard Wilson we'll agree with you
[43:44] brother Jimmy Harris will agree with you
[43:46] brother Dean Gibby will agree with you
[43:49] all those different ones that are out
[43:50] there
[43:51] they will agree yes that they were
[43:54] helped by Brother Dale's Ministry so
[43:55] it's not diminished it's just more
[43:58] that's the problem with Satan he tries
[44:00] to destroy that cut it off and God said
[44:03] no I just got it in somebody else uh no
[44:05] I just got it in 70 others no no no not
[44:09] just you Moses I got 70 people uh hold
[44:12] on Elijah Don't Be grumbling
[44:15] I got several thousand hit away that
[44:18] have not bowed the need to bail I have a
[44:20] group of people that said away that
[44:21] doesn't take all the garbage in this
[44:23] message hello somebody
[44:25] all right and tries to shove it down to
[44:26] people's throat we've been taught well
[44:28] so we're going to continue on somebody's
[44:30] gonna make it we are going to make it
[44:32] and we are going to be this what he said
[44:35] right here through the ministry you're
[44:37] going to be presented holy and
[44:39] unblameable and unreprovable in God's
[44:42] sight and listen that's not wait until
[44:45] we get over there
[44:47] that's right here's where we conquer
[44:50] there's where we enjoy the victory
[44:53] here's where we conquer right here
[44:55] starts today there's your day of your
[44:58] salvation today the gospel has come to
[45:01] you in power and demonstration or
[45:03] sometimes we don't think so sometimes we
[45:05] think we have boring meetings but guess
[45:07] what the word will not return void it
[45:10] will accomplish in somebody something
[45:13] that he has already planned and you just
[45:16] open yourself up and you what today you
[45:18] bring good ground
[45:20] or either you brought Stony ground
[45:24] that's what the r or you brought ground
[45:26] that's totally dry because you hadn't
[45:29] been wet all week
[45:31] by the water of the word
[45:33] amen
[45:34] like brother Louise said we know one
[45:36] thing's for sure water's wet
[45:40] water's wet there's no there's no
[45:42] mystery well you know what this gospel
[45:45] is the truth there's no mystery we're in
[45:48] the right place and I'm not talking
[45:49] about sitting here and I'm talking about
[45:50] the right message of the hour We're in
[45:53] the message of the hour so let's just
[45:55] live it out because you know what one
[45:58] thing's for sure and I'll read it just a
[46:00] minute when when when those people were
[46:03] called Disciples
[46:05] Jesus called him disciples right you
[46:08] know what that word if you break it down
[46:10] that word disciple means discipline
[46:15] they were disciplined to what Jesus was
[46:18] saying there was a group of people that
[46:20] wasn't
[46:21] Fair season Sadducees they were not
[46:23] disciplined to what Jesus was saying but
[46:26] the disciples even though they didn't
[46:28] know every little a and indeed they
[46:30] stayed there long enough to where God
[46:33] prayed for him Jesus prayed for him in
[46:35] John 17 as we read many times before he
[46:38] prayed for that group of people and me
[46:40] and you that
[46:43] all right what's the mystery the mystery
[46:45] of this whole thing is is Christ in you
[46:47] the hope of glory Christ is going to be
[46:48] in you not coming back in human flesh
[46:51] until the Millennium so it's all laying
[46:54] on a group of Gentiles bride and a group
[46:57] of
[46:58] Jews 144 000 that's all that's left
[47:01] that's right
[47:02] everybody with me there's no more
[47:05] prophets to come no more Church ages to
[47:08] come no more Messengers right there's
[47:11] none of that
[47:12] this is it this is the finish the final
[47:15] voice to the final age under our
[47:17] messenger not under Luther not under
[47:19] Wesley not under Pentecost
[47:22] that's right under our messenger that we
[47:25] I hope we're sitting here today agreeing
[47:28] with that God sent us a messenger
[47:30] so that you know why so that he can
[47:33] spawn Church listen they wasn't a
[47:34] message church when brother Raymond was
[47:35] here they were still Methodist Baptist
[47:38] Pentecost the awesome came out you had
[47:41] some Independence and different ones but
[47:43] remember when brother rhyme died a lot
[47:45] of them went right back to their
[47:46] denomination
[47:47] God there was nowhere else to go all
[47:49] right but thank God there was people
[47:51] like brother mode brother Dale different
[47:52] ones in the 60s brother Mike Canada
[47:54] different ones and if I miss somebody
[47:56] I'm sorry but take these Warriors of
[47:58] faith that that caught the message at
[48:00] least caught part of it
[48:02] and brought it to the people
[48:05] thank God that's how he works God's
[48:07] going to do that he's going to have a
[48:08] bride whether we want to be it or not
[48:10] all right which is Christ in you the
[48:12] hope of glory whom we preach you have
[48:15] heard in this church it is Christ in you
[48:17] the hope of glory it's not just an
[48:19] anointing it's not just we love the
[48:21] message and we love brother Dale and we
[48:22] love brother so-and-so's this and
[48:25] singing and we love this we that don't
[48:27] have one thing to do with it
[48:29] it's the love of God the Bible says that
[48:31] shed abroad in your heart all right so
[48:34] it's costing you the hope of glory whom
[48:36] we preach warning every man and teaching
[48:38] every man in all wisdom that we may
[48:41] present every man perfect in Christ
[48:43] Jesus and that's where we get into
[48:45] godliness is that is the Perfection as
[48:48] brother Louise said here's the same
[48:49] quote from statue of perfect man brother
[48:51] Brown said oh yes you can oh I can't
[48:54] brother Branham oh yes you can you know
[48:57] what to me that's the saith the Lord
[48:58] yeah that's right that's the set the
[49:01] Lord to a prophet that says yes you can
[49:03] the door has been opened where you can
[49:05] what receive and not receive like
[49:08] Lutheran Wesley they were all closed
[49:10] doors
[49:12] we're open doors
[49:14] to what to the truth
[49:17] not to error to the truth
[49:20] oh yes you can
[49:22] then we've been talking about deity it
[49:25] fell on the day of Pentecost we love
[49:26] that oh fellow
[49:28] you know 120 upper room and 3 000
[49:30] downstairs and oh praise the Lord they
[49:32] spoke in tongues and they baptized them
[49:34] it fell here too
[49:36] it's still falling but what the whole
[49:40] thing is that deity that fell on the day
[49:42] of Pentecost is the same that you got
[49:44] today plus
[49:47] the anointing of the age
[49:49] and by with me plus the anointing of the
[49:52] age not another Holy Ghost but Plus
[49:56] the open book
[49:58] right because even on the day of
[49:59] Pentecost they weren't working under an
[50:00] open book they didn't understand what
[50:02] the seals were wasn't supposed to
[50:04] believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and
[50:06] thou shalt be saved that was good enough
[50:07] for them at the moment and They Carried
[50:09] that on and they healed the sick raised
[50:11] the dead what's our problem
[50:13] well praise the Lord anyway
[50:17] they only do his will he's talking about
[50:19] uh pick up your pen and write so this is
[50:22] the Holy Ghost writing to me and you all
[50:23] right they do only his will amen I
[50:27] believe that no one can persuade them
[50:29] different now see we have been persuaded
[50:30] not we but I say the message of the hour
[50:32] has been persuaded into all these
[50:34] different factions and all these
[50:36] different ideas about the message of the
[50:38] hour amen
[50:40] but brother Brown said they have thus
[50:42] set the Lord and they keep still in
[50:43] other words if you have thus says the
[50:45] Lord yeah move if we don't have thus
[50:47] says the Lord sit still all right then
[50:50] they will do the works of God what is it
[50:52] the gospel the preaching of the word of
[50:55] God for it is himself in them all right
[50:59] it's himself in them not an anointing
[51:03] this world is Anointed
[51:06] but you and I have come through a birth
[51:10] as he did complete in his day all things
[51:13] when he was here he did not complete all
[51:15] when he was here for it was not time yet
[51:17] so what is the completion of the Gospel
[51:19] or the word of God it's me and you
[51:21] sitting here today there is not another
[51:22] I just don't believe Brothers 90 there's
[51:25] going to be another generation
[51:27] if we're here another 40 years
[51:29] about 90 percent of everything gonna be
[51:31] here
[51:34] all right
[51:37] I hope that don't happen
[51:39] I'm praying
[51:41] that this generation will see the coming
[51:43] of the Lord
[51:45] through a group of people they're not
[51:46] going to see the coming of the Lord in
[51:48] the cloud
[51:50] open these no they're going to see it in
[51:52] a group of people
[51:53] and they're going to be at brother Brown
[51:55] said just for a moment there'll be a
[51:56] powerful group
[51:57] I believe when we get toward the end of
[51:59] this thing when we get toward the body
[52:01] change
[52:02] Nothing's Gonna harm us death will just
[52:05] be something that you talk about
[52:08] not something you're scared of
[52:10] them and to the doctrine which is
[52:12] according to Godliness what is a
[52:14] Doctrine a set of ideas or beliefs that
[52:16] are taught or believed to be true that's
[52:18] what I was saying just a few minutes ago
[52:19] we have we have a Doctrine here at this
[52:22] church everybody has a Doctrine all
[52:25] right we have a Doctrine brother Brown
[52:27] said every church needs a Doctrine to be
[52:29] a very successful Christian to and to be
[52:31] first step in successful Christianity
[52:34] sorry is to show that man has received
[52:36] the Holy Spirit is humility all right do
[52:39] it in humbleness real god-given humility
[52:41] now I want you to remember humility is
[52:44] not having no backbone though because
[52:46] brother Brown I believe he caught that
[52:49] and he said oh oh wait a minute it must
[52:52] be humble but
[52:54] yet a church without a Doctrine is like
[52:56] a jellyfish
[52:58] it has no backbone so we've got to have
[53:01] backbone in it
[53:03] is to be given humbly but it's not to be
[53:05] smacked around and used any way you want
[53:07] to no it's going to have a purpose and
[53:09] I'd also back bone but it's got teeth
[53:12] amen because the Church of God must eat
[53:15] the bread of life Romans 1 verse 16 for
[53:17] I am not ashamed of the Gospel how many
[53:19] of us are not ashamed of the Gospel I'm
[53:21] not ashamed of this thing that we're
[53:23] that we're in I'm not ashamed of that of
[53:26] the gospel of Christ for what there's
[53:28] your power
[53:29] to not be ashamed is power
[53:33] power of God unto salvation to everyone
[53:35] that believeth
[53:37] we'll get to this in just a minute we
[53:38] talked a little bit last time about the
[53:40] filter and this Veil we understand that
[53:43] if we if we in the Garden of Eden if
[53:46] we've been driven out I say we when Adam
[53:48] and Eve got driven out we got driven out
[53:49] with them all right everybody with me
[53:51] nobody stayed in the Garden of Eden they
[53:53] got driven out we got driven out with
[53:55] them but there was a promise in in
[53:57] Genesis 3 fit thing that we were going
[53:59] to go back that he was going to come
[54:01] what and condescend to a baby die for us
[54:04] and then take us back home
[54:06] all God was he poured into cross Christ
[54:08] in the church Hallelujah take her back
[54:11] to the Garden of Eden so back to an
[54:13] eating condition
[54:14] so what was it in Eden
[54:16] the reason they didn't know that we're
[54:18] naked because there was a holy ghost
[54:19] Veil on them from nakedness
[54:22] so we need a holy ghost Veil for that
[54:24] plus other things all right
[54:26] they didn't know it
[54:28] now listen
[54:31] there is no way
[54:34] I'm just going to be plain there's no
[54:35] way you can look at somebody and not see
[54:37] this or naked not now
[54:39] because we're out from under that Veil
[54:41] all right but now remember
[54:44] there's a group of people though that
[54:46] thinks they have clothes on
[54:49] ah Revelations
[54:51] Thou Art blind wretched miserable naked
[54:56] and don't know it that's the perversion
[55:00] that has come from the garden
[55:05] but listen we're not caught in that
[55:07] praise God we've been brought above that
[55:10] we have that Holy Ghost bail now back on
[55:13] us
[55:14] I really believe that we have that Holy
[55:16] Ghost spelling that you say well now
[55:18] what we still have problems amen but
[55:20] your soul by the baptism of my Holy
[55:22] Ghost when I look at a naked somebody
[55:25] and when we say naked we don't mean just
[55:27] uncloged we mean unclothing other things
[55:29] like gospel and all the different things
[55:31] outside all right because a whole it
[55:34] says the Bible says in the end time
[55:35] they'll be naked yes but they won't know
[55:37] it
[55:38] all right but we'll know it
[55:40] but we're going back to where the Holy
[55:42] Ghost put
[55:44] a veil over their eyes
[55:46] they see nothing but their brother and
[55:48] sister see now this is a key because
[55:51] this is what we're coming to in
[55:52] brotherly kindness
[55:53] because there's a real fine line more
[55:56] fine than my finger
[55:57] between filial love
[56:01] lust down this way
[56:03] because you know what you can say I love
[56:05] my brother and love my sister and love
[56:07] him wrong
[56:08] if you love them feelio that's where
[56:11] people get in trouble with adulteries
[56:17] because you have to be careful even as a
[56:19] minister you don't ministers and it do
[56:22] not be caught
[56:23] in a room with a woman by himself try
[56:27] not to if you're going to talk to
[56:28] somebody talk out in public
[56:29] but if if somebody wants to talk to to
[56:32] me a sister June goes with me because
[56:35] you just don't know it's not it's like
[56:37] really Gary Longoria said he said it's
[56:39] not you that we don't trust it's the
[56:40] devil
[56:41] we don't trust him we don't trust the
[56:43] devil so we don't want to do that we
[56:45] want to do everything what be brothers
[56:47] and sisters shake a hand say God bless
[56:51] you and do like we're learning
[56:52] Villanueva told Mama he said sister I
[56:54] said I love your sister Peggy so much I
[56:56] give you a hug he said but I can't he
[56:58] said but I'll give you one in the
[56:59] millennium all right well he's over
[57:01] there waiting in the sixth Dimension
[57:02] okay he's waiting over there and I'm
[57:05] sure he's been hugging everybody out man
[57:06] hugger
[57:08] but that's all right with me I don't
[57:10] mind
[57:11] if it's done in a proper way it's it's
[57:13] holy and without blame but if it's done
[57:16] in an Unholy way now look now the spirit
[57:18] of unholiness uncleanness and lust has
[57:22] veiled them
[57:24] education science all right
[57:27] that's what the prophet said to us now I
[57:29] want to I want to cover one thing this
[57:30] right here real quick because I think
[57:33] it's important to understand when we
[57:34] talk about
[57:36] when we talk about what happened in the
[57:38] Old Testament as far as as anointings
[57:41] and as far as them not having the new
[57:43] birth see that's a strange Doctrine to a
[57:46] lot of people too uh you talk to people
[57:47] in the message even they say oh yeah
[57:49] Abraham was born again no Abraham was
[57:51] not born again
[57:53] Moses was not one again
[57:56] that was
[57:58] the Old Testament no one could get born
[58:00] again
[58:03] under the blood of an animal
[58:07] they're sin the sin was still there
[58:11] but now the below to Jesus Christ
[58:12] remember holy yes
[58:15] unblameable all right the only way you
[58:18] can do that is take it away
[58:20] hey man everybody with me so now Genesis
[58:22] 1 26 we go back to this scripture and
[58:25] you know I love it but you continue
[58:26] pulling the the layers off the the onion
[58:29] peel you keep peeling the onion you keep
[58:31] getting the same thing keep getting
[58:32] onion no matter how thin it is so this
[58:35] to me the Statue of perfect man this is
[58:37] a key to understand Genesis 1 26 that
[58:40] God said let us make man in our image so
[58:43] now if you if we look at that and we we
[58:46] look at it with just normal eyes
[58:49] then the world and even most
[58:52] denominations will tell you that's every
[58:54] human being that was ever on the face of
[58:56] the Earth
[58:57] that's not
[59:00] brother Brandon was real clear about
[59:02] that that's not every human being
[59:05] that's only the redeemed that's only his
[59:09] children listen Abraham Isaac Jacob
[59:12] Joseph David Sampson all the different
[59:15] ones that they're not the children of
[59:17] God
[59:18] they're not his genealogy they are in
[59:21] the economy of God yes sir they are and
[59:24] will be given eternal life amen and they
[59:27] will have a seat and a position because
[59:29] the 12 Patriarchs
[59:32] all right you got your 12 disciples now
[59:34] we know they were born again but then
[59:36] you got your 12 Patriots that are over
[59:37] here in the Old Testament they weren't
[59:38] born again but they're what they're
[59:40] giving eternal life they have a position
[59:43] a position in God and we'll look at it
[59:45] just a second but it said let us make
[59:46] man in our image so whatever he made it
[59:49] was in the image of God it looked like
[59:51] God acted like God and was a part of God
[59:53] all right amen
[59:56] and let them have dominion so he he gave
[59:58] them a power he gave them a Dominion to
[1:00:00] have over the whole the fish of the sea
[1:00:03] fouled the air cattle we we understand
[1:00:05] let's keep going so God created whoever
[1:00:07] he whatever this person is
[1:00:11] God said here
[1:00:14] you're in my image
[1:00:16] I have give you power
[1:00:19] over this world
[1:00:21] Cosmo uh not not the cosmos I'm sorry
[1:00:23] but the dirt the world
[1:00:26] and even actually
[1:00:29] Adam ran the economy
[1:00:31] of the world
[1:00:34] he ran everything
[1:00:36] so God created man his own image so
[1:00:38] whatever that was done we know that word
[1:00:41] created is not it's formed it's not
[1:00:43] created because it always was a part of
[1:00:45] God what he done was he said okay I'm
[1:00:47] gonna have some kids it's going to look
[1:00:48] like me here they are
[1:00:50] right right that's right
[1:00:59] God Alone by itself
[1:01:01] with his stocks before the foundation in
[1:01:03] the world
[1:01:05] before anything was even formed before
[1:01:06] there was a star moon angel
[1:01:10] we were here
[1:01:13] he said I'm gonna make somebody that's
[1:01:15] like me that's come out just like me and
[1:01:16] there he is
[1:01:18] in my image he looks like me he acts
[1:01:21] like me he is me
[1:01:24] only God can do that I can act like Dad
[1:01:27] look like that and all these different
[1:01:28] things but I have my own DNA I have on
[1:01:30] my own person right but now we we
[1:01:33] through the fall got our own personality
[1:01:35] but what's it doing come on people it's
[1:01:37] working our way back to that image
[1:01:40] because when you got born again this
[1:01:43] image came into your soul yes
[1:01:46] and it burned the old image out
[1:01:50] didn't kill your soul burn it out listen
[1:01:53] God can burn and not kill
[1:01:57] come on
[1:01:58] what are some Hebrew children in a
[1:02:01] turn this one time
[1:02:03] hmm
[1:02:04] talk about a body change
[1:02:08] I've walked around some real hot
[1:02:09] furnaces and grills and some real hot
[1:02:11] fire and I mean red hot Jim's dad used
[1:02:14] to we used to have a fire at
[1:02:15] Thanksgiving and that poor old uh um he
[1:02:18] took two actually took two big tight big
[1:02:21] tire inner things of a tractor-trailer
[1:02:24] welded them together and we used to make
[1:02:26] that thing a red hot
[1:02:29] you could touch it with a stick on the
[1:02:31] outside and it would burn well you know
[1:02:32] what the Hebrew children
[1:02:35] they met that
[1:02:37] times about a hundred because I'm sure
[1:02:38] there wasn't a little bitty firmer
[1:02:40] furnace that all three of them had to
[1:02:41] struggle to get in
[1:02:43] no it was a big old furnace with big old
[1:02:45] doors because when they opened the doors
[1:02:47] up it killed the ones that were around
[1:02:48] him talk about a body change
[1:02:51] see that's a precursor to me and you
[1:02:53] yeah it's not going to matter if they
[1:02:55] shoot Bombs all over the place and
[1:02:58] you're if you're in a glorified body
[1:03:00] ain't gonna hurt you
[1:03:01] because it's not gonna hurt that one
[1:03:03] inside because that was made in His
[1:03:04] image this is eternal as Eternal as God
[1:03:06] is because it came from God it was
[1:03:09] formed from God into an image and what
[1:03:12] happened was we lost that image in the
[1:03:14] garden
[1:03:16] yeah amen Adam didn't lose eternal life
[1:03:19] he lost the ability to produce that
[1:03:22] image over and over again everybody with
[1:03:24] me all right he he lost he lost the
[1:03:28] godship
[1:03:30] to that degree that him and Eve could
[1:03:33] not bring forth any children
[1:03:37] the way they were supposed to because
[1:03:39] the womb of her mind and the womb of her
[1:03:41] body was polluted and God couldn't said
[1:03:43] okay hang on man
[1:03:45] I gotta put this back
[1:03:47] I need to save this
[1:03:49] but I'm going to anoint a group of
[1:03:51] people I'm going to anoint a Moses and a
[1:03:53] Samson and a Abraham and a I'm going to
[1:03:55] anoint them and make them examples of
[1:03:58] this that's coming amen
[1:04:00] amen because I can't put this in a womb
[1:04:02] now I'm talking about this womb I can't
[1:04:03] put it in this womb now right right
[1:04:05] everybody with me you're gonna have to
[1:04:07] come through the normal womb or the the
[1:04:09] perverted womb you're gonna have to come
[1:04:11] by childbearing and all those other
[1:04:12] things everybody with me on this but
[1:04:15] that's the character though that when we
[1:04:17] got born again that's the character that
[1:04:19] we got we got that thing
[1:04:21] let's call it a thing the Bible did that
[1:04:24] thing in you
[1:04:25] right that thing that's in you is that
[1:04:29] Genesis 1 26 man
[1:04:31] no less no more but it's encapsulated
[1:04:35] inside of your
[1:04:38] not glorified body
[1:04:41] that's why sin is so bad
[1:04:44] even when you attach
[1:04:48] eternity yeah to your human body you
[1:04:51] still got problems you've still got
[1:04:53] Spirit problems you still got flesh
[1:04:55] problems
[1:04:57] but not Soul problems if you're born
[1:04:59] again listen if you're not born again
[1:05:00] you've got all three problems it's all
[1:05:04] body and spirit
[1:05:05] Paul said I wish that what your soul
[1:05:07] body and spirit be blameless
[1:05:09] now he didn't come to that
[1:05:12] you and I that was a prophecy for us to
[1:05:15] come to yes amen listen it's not just
[1:05:18] it's a requirement
[1:05:20] like these versions of requirement
[1:05:23] but God's already give us the plan
[1:05:25] everybody with me on that so male and
[1:05:27] female created he them but he couldn't
[1:05:29] put him in flesh yet he couldn't he
[1:05:32] could he could only anoint he'd take a
[1:05:34] piece of that because listen
[1:05:37] whatever Moses did we'll look at it
[1:05:39] right here
[1:05:41] David all these different ones these
[1:05:43] these hold on a minute these Heroes of
[1:05:46] Faith
[1:05:50] uh they're all all them are pretty much
[1:05:51] in Hebrews 11.
[1:05:53] which is the Hall of Fame of Faith right
[1:05:56] but they all have flaws
[1:05:59] they all had flaws
[1:06:02] without
[1:06:07] Moses had power
[1:06:10] to deliver the children of Israel but he
[1:06:12] didn't have the character of God or he
[1:06:14] wouldn't have killed that Egyptian he
[1:06:15] got so mad he killed that Egyptian so he
[1:06:19] became a murderer
[1:06:21] but yet God still would anoint him so
[1:06:24] much they'd have to look away from him
[1:06:25] because his face
[1:06:26] so much
[1:06:28] and whatever Moses said brother Brown
[1:06:30] said whatever Moses said that's what God
[1:06:32] did
[1:06:33] that he said flies flies came fleas
[1:06:34] fleas come amen so he had power but he
[1:06:38] didn't have the character to go with it
[1:06:40] there had to be one that was holding the
[1:06:42] character
[1:06:46] David
[1:06:47] would not have been a murderer and an
[1:06:50] adulterer but he was anointed
[1:06:53] for the kingship remember the time that
[1:06:57] he when he went to Bathsheba he was
[1:06:59] already King
[1:07:01] Samuel had already anointed him remember
[1:07:04] Samuel goes and there's there's seven
[1:07:06] sons there you know and he looks at each
[1:07:08] one he doesn't see he doesn't feel any
[1:07:10] anointing
[1:07:11] he said hey God sent me here
[1:07:15] have you got another one around here
[1:07:16] somewhere he said oh man I got this
[1:07:18] little my my baby
[1:07:21] my least one he's around there he smells
[1:07:23] like sheep we probably need to wash him
[1:07:24] before he comes in you know because all
[1:07:26] those other brothers the Bible said were
[1:07:28] you know there were
[1:07:29] you know a Men of War because remember
[1:07:31] they got on David's skin when David went
[1:07:34] into the camp they're like
[1:07:37] assistant get out of here right what are
[1:07:39] you here for
[1:07:41] well he was there because he was
[1:07:42] anointed
[1:07:44] and that anointing didn't come off of
[1:07:45] him
[1:07:46] but remember he was a murderer
[1:07:51] and he was an adulterer
[1:07:54] Samson
[1:07:55] he had a Nazarite foul
[1:07:57] God anointed him so much to like like
[1:07:59] somebody said the other day he wasn't
[1:08:02] this big Samson this great big Arnold
[1:08:04] Schwarzenegger looking thing he was you
[1:08:06] know he looked like Ryan Maybe
[1:08:10] skinny
[1:08:11] pale
[1:08:13] praise the Lord praise the Lord anyway
[1:08:15] we love Ryan you know that but he's
[1:08:18] about the skinniest one in the building
[1:08:19] he needs to eat born is a
[1:08:23] so but Samson was that was the Marvel
[1:08:28] why do you think they were trying to
[1:08:29] track him down and find out where his
[1:08:31] power came from but remember he had
[1:08:33] power but no character to go with it
[1:08:37] because the character he had was he was
[1:08:39] a womanizer and he let a woman take him
[1:08:42] down he was disobedient to that Nazarite
[1:08:45] vow through a woman
[1:08:46] deceiving him all right Abraham
[1:08:50] what'd he do he gave his wife away twice
[1:08:53] laughed at God but yet God anointed him
[1:08:56] to be the father of our faith and by
[1:08:59] with me all right didn't have the
[1:09:01] Genesis 126 man if not then this
[1:09:04] character would have changed
[1:09:07] the character of the Old Testament would
[1:09:09] have changed
[1:09:11] if this would have been in him come on
[1:09:13] this Genesis 1 26 man
[1:09:15] this new birth this Holy Ghost inside of
[1:09:19] you not anointing you
[1:09:21] because remember you can be anointed by
[1:09:23] the pure baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[1:09:25] dying go to hell anointed but you can't
[1:09:28] have this inside your soul and be lost
[1:09:29] all right
[1:09:31] so Jacob shyster Tripper upper he was
[1:09:35] him and Laban back and forth with each
[1:09:37] other he just was not an honest guy
[1:09:40] but God loved Jacob but remember Jacob
[1:09:43] had to have a name change
[1:09:45] he had to be changed to Israel
[1:09:47] as a prince with God or a limping Prince
[1:09:49] but he had a flaw yeah Noah died or
[1:09:53] drunk great man remember in the
[1:09:55] beginning of Noah's life
[1:09:57] he walked with God yeah yeah right walk
[1:10:01] before me and be perfect Noah was what
[1:10:03] perfect in the eyes of God or or he
[1:10:06] lived right
[1:10:07] but look at the end of his life he died
[1:10:10] a drunk
[1:10:12] Saul wow Saul
[1:10:15] was the man of the hour
[1:10:17] he was like this real big basketball
[1:10:20] player looking thing taller than anybody
[1:10:22] else good looking guy but he didn't have
[1:10:26] it in his heart really to be a king
[1:10:28] because he turned everything down almost
[1:10:30] that Samuel told him he did the opposite
[1:10:34] then Nathan told him what to do he did
[1:10:36] the opposite he never was obedient
[1:10:40] to the word of God for the hour does
[1:10:42] that sound familiar so you see what you
[1:10:44] get you get a saw but now remember he
[1:10:46] was so anointed until he prophesied and
[1:10:49] David said touch not mine anointed
[1:10:51] listen Saul's going to be in heaven
[1:10:54] right as bad as we look at him in as bad
[1:10:56] as we look at all these they're going to
[1:10:58] be in heaven with eternal life yes
[1:11:01] living with us
[1:11:02] now we're going to have to talk to Saul
[1:11:04] a little bit longer or higher because
[1:11:06] he's up here but that's okay but he's
[1:11:08] going to be in heaven
[1:11:09] Elisha
[1:11:12] he must have had a pretty quick temper
[1:11:15] but he had an anointing remember it came
[1:11:17] off of Elijah
[1:11:18] and it fell on Elisha but it was power
[1:11:22] without character
[1:11:25] and they said hey old ball head
[1:11:27] and he turned around and he's and he
[1:11:30] cursed them
[1:11:32] and children were eat up by bears
[1:11:35] because of Elisha
[1:11:37] but he was anointed for the time
[1:11:40] amen I'm gonna do a sermon one day on
[1:11:42] anointed for the time because that's
[1:11:44] what that's we're anointed for the time
[1:11:46] too but those in the Old Testament
[1:11:49] were anointed for their time and the
[1:11:51] Bible tells them look it says they're
[1:11:54] examples
[1:11:56] they're examples for us
[1:11:59] we're not to act like David totally
[1:12:02] we're not to act like Esau I mean not
[1:12:04] Esau but Noah we're not to act like I'm
[1:12:06] totally we're to use pieces in their
[1:12:08] life
[1:12:10] yeah right correct examples
[1:12:15] but they didn't receive the promise
[1:12:18] according to Hebrews 11.
[1:12:21] we have a better thing
[1:12:24] we had this come
[1:12:26] and a man look God in flesh had to come
[1:12:29] to bring power with character
[1:12:31] think about that God had to come in
[1:12:33] human flesh that's why he could
[1:12:34] condescend to give us the character of
[1:12:37] God you know what to get this guy out
[1:12:40] to where he could be on display this is
[1:12:43] the display of God Adam and Eve was
[1:12:46] supposed to be the display of God
[1:12:48] that's what they were put there for in
[1:12:50] that Genesis 1 26 man was put inside of
[1:12:53] them to be at this play of the character
[1:12:55] of God but they messed it up
[1:12:58] God had to take that character back and
[1:13:01] just then I'll show a little peace in
[1:13:04] Noah a little piece in David a little
[1:13:07] piece and different ones that we've got
[1:13:08] listed here there's different ones
[1:13:10] different pieces but remember
[1:13:13] the whole piece showed up
[1:13:17] The Headstone showed up not just part
[1:13:20] truth not just an anointing
[1:13:23] but the man
[1:13:25] God and flesh had to come to bring power
[1:13:28] with character could brother Brown
[1:13:30] remember what he say power without
[1:13:31] character is satanic
[1:13:34] you're saying they act like Satan yeah
[1:13:36] they act like Satan's listen God don't
[1:13:39] God don't commit adultery
[1:13:41] God don't kill somebody out of malice
[1:13:44] like David did in the different ones
[1:13:45] that was the devil that anointed them to
[1:13:48] do those things because there was not
[1:13:49] this in their to keep them
[1:13:52] today you have this to keep you
[1:13:56] like I said before that spiritual Rudder
[1:13:58] the boat's still there
[1:13:59] you just received a Rudder amen that
[1:14:02] turns you away from those things where
[1:14:04] Moses
[1:14:06] I I think of Moses a lot of times
[1:14:08] because Moses is the one remember he was
[1:14:10] brought up from a baby
[1:14:12] told by his mama he was a deliverer
[1:14:14] remember brother around me tell us the
[1:14:15] whole story his mama God put his mama
[1:14:18] there to nurse him raise him up tell him
[1:14:21] who he was but now remember what was
[1:14:23] Moses's interpretation of that
[1:14:26] not white on God his interpretation of
[1:14:29] that was I got to do it now I think I'll
[1:14:31] take over I'm going to learn to be a
[1:14:33] military man he was shrewd I'm gonna
[1:14:35] learn to be the next guy to pharaoh
[1:14:40] cause see somewhere in that line he got
[1:14:42] adopted because remember he was next in
[1:14:44] line
[1:14:46] and he had what he had the people under
[1:14:49] him brother Ryan said he could have you
[1:14:51] could raise an army up and that was in
[1:14:54] his mentality but what he had power
[1:14:55] without character
[1:14:58] and that spilled over into him killing
[1:15:00] an Egyptian not waiting on the plan of
[1:15:02] God but killing an Egyptian and remember
[1:15:05] it took him 40 more years to get back to
[1:15:10] that same place that's right but he had
[1:15:13] something a little different he had an
[1:15:14] anointing he made a burning bush
[1:15:16] and when he met that burning bush God
[1:15:19] said I'll go with you oh
[1:15:21] I'll give you what you need it's time
[1:15:24] now
[1:15:25] but remember
[1:15:27] who cried out for the deliverer the
[1:15:30] people
[1:15:32] the people cried out for a deliverer
[1:15:34] Israel cried out for a deliverer
[1:15:38] look
[1:15:40] see God can condescend but Satan cannot
[1:15:42] Satan wants to be haughty high-minded
[1:15:43] lovers of pleasure more lovers of God we
[1:15:45] read about him all the time all right
[1:15:47] and he listen he is Anointed
[1:15:50] right right yeah he is the anointed
[1:15:52] cherub so God anointed him but he used
[1:15:55] the anointing wrong
[1:15:59] that's the only way I can explain to the
[1:16:00] devil
[1:16:01] because the Bible says
[1:16:04] through God's lips through a prophet
[1:16:06] says you are the and have been created
[1:16:09] the anointed chair
[1:16:11] you're the one that covereth you're the
[1:16:13] one that walketh up and down you're the
[1:16:14] one that does this you're the one who
[1:16:16] does that
[1:16:17] right
[1:16:18] he didn't have said he went
[1:16:20] self-anointed he was anointed by God
[1:16:23] but he chose to take that anointing and
[1:16:25] use it different
[1:16:27] to be his own person to have his own
[1:16:29] Army to have his own what his own group
[1:16:31] that's why he went to the angels he
[1:16:33] needed a little bit more power he
[1:16:34] couldn't get enough power in his own
[1:16:35] self he had to go out here and get a
[1:16:37] group and that's the way the devil is
[1:16:38] he really don't work by himself how many
[1:16:40] times brother Dale told you you don't
[1:16:42] stand alone right hey man if you sneak
[1:16:45] around on Weight Watchers and you go get
[1:16:46] you some ice cream somebody's got to be
[1:16:48] there with you
[1:16:49] sister Jim bless you
[1:16:53] and then they look at you and say we
[1:16:54] don't sin alone do we praise the Lord
[1:16:58] but you don't you don't listen you
[1:17:01] always affect somebody else think about
[1:17:03] it when you send your fact yourself but
[1:17:05] you always affect somebody else all
[1:17:07] right so think about that and that's the
[1:17:09] way Satan is let's just take that effect
[1:17:11] out of the way though let's bring power
[1:17:12] with character and it'll kind of turn us
[1:17:15] around as we're talking getting toward
[1:17:16] brotherly kindness because I I don't
[1:17:19] read it today I read it to you this
[1:17:21] afternoon
[1:17:22] the two greatest Commandments Jesus said
[1:17:24] if you look Jesus said if you can't do
[1:17:27] 10.
[1:17:28] you know what he was saying
[1:17:31] master
[1:17:33] what's the greatest of the Commandment
[1:17:36] oh it's surely it's Thou shalt not kill
[1:17:39] surely Thou shalt not stale
[1:17:42] surely it's this he said hold on man he
[1:17:46] said the two greatest Commandments
[1:17:48] what were they
[1:17:49] believe in one God with all your mind
[1:17:53] Soul and Spirit
[1:17:56] and love your neighbor
[1:17:58] as you love yourself
[1:18:01] and I'll read it tonight he said in
[1:18:03] those two Commandments hangs everything
[1:18:06] the law and the prophets everything
[1:18:09] hangs on you doing those two
[1:18:11] Commandments and the second one fits
[1:18:14] right in with brotherly kindness
[1:18:16] hey man we'll get to that maybe in a
[1:18:18] second but see the religious story of
[1:18:20] the day what did they say listen this
[1:18:23] was God a human flesh this was God that
[1:18:25] came the way the Old Testament said he
[1:18:27] would come that's right
[1:18:28] but what the religious story of the day
[1:18:30] say you give me God
[1:18:38] before you start talking to people about
[1:18:39] Holiness today and about godliness today
[1:18:41] they'll say you ain't a perfect name
[1:18:42] perfect I got these flaws and I can say
[1:18:45] I can cuss a little bit and I can do
[1:18:47] this a little bit
[1:18:49] Richard sent me a
[1:18:52] something he got behind a car
[1:18:55] only them can get behind a car that says
[1:18:57] I love Jesus but I cuss a little
[1:19:05] so he sends it to me and he said this is
[1:19:06] what you've been preaching them
[1:19:10] but the religious story
[1:19:16] We're not gonna have a standard above
[1:19:18] the world we're just going to live like
[1:19:20] them
[1:19:21] yeah and let's agree with the world
[1:19:23] but but but but but when we go to church
[1:19:25] uh well you know clean
[1:19:27] let's clean it off and
[1:19:33] get that cussing out of our mouth
[1:19:36] hmm but what
[1:19:39] if God and human flesh were standing
[1:19:40] there telling them everything about
[1:19:42] himself right
[1:19:43] right and what he's going to do to me
[1:19:45] and you
[1:19:47] what about today the religious order and
[1:19:49] today is going to do the same thing you
[1:19:51] can't be God
[1:19:55] because they don't know what the true
[1:19:56] New Birth is
[1:19:59] if you have the new birth today
[1:20:01] if you get born again in five seconds
[1:20:04] from right now truly get born again
[1:20:08] you're just as Eternal as God is you're
[1:20:10] just as perfect as God is you have no
[1:20:12] spot you have no wrinkle your robe is
[1:20:15] white yes amen instantly
[1:20:18] oh yeah we know it takes a process I
[1:20:20] didn't talk about justifications I just
[1:20:22] said if you get bored again today all
[1:20:24] right your walk continues up and you get
[1:20:27] born again today you have that person
[1:20:29] inside of you
[1:20:31] and the religious story of the day is
[1:20:33] going to say
[1:20:35] I can cuss a little and still be like
[1:20:37] God no if God don't cuss and for those
[1:20:41] of you that live up north if you're
[1:20:42] watching from Ohio cuss is Curse
[1:20:45] we just say cuss in the south
[1:20:48] because Granny always says quit cussing
[1:20:57] everybody all right but their related so
[1:21:00] their day's going to say the same thing
[1:21:01] about me and you but we have power with
[1:21:05] character they may have power sure they
[1:21:07] may be healing they may feel emotion
[1:21:09] they may feel the presence of God
[1:21:13] and be sitting there with short hair and
[1:21:15] a pair of shorts on
[1:21:19] praise God but it's just gonna be
[1:21:21] temporary right right because you're
[1:21:24] gonna go back to cussing again yes
[1:21:27] or whatever I just like cussing because
[1:21:29] that's what we've been talking about
[1:21:31] it's really strange to have say would
[1:21:33] you see somebody that would make
[1:21:35] something like that and put it on your
[1:21:37] car
[1:21:38] that's how bold people are I love Jesus
[1:21:41] but I cuss a little
[1:21:42] and I let the whole world know it
[1:21:45] y'all just on the back of my card if you
[1:21:47] get too close guess what
[1:21:51] I'm gonna prove that point
[1:21:54] I'm gonna cuss you out
[1:21:57] but the religious story of the day is
[1:21:59] going to do the same same me and you we
[1:22:01] sit here today and I was thinking about
[1:22:02] this morning
[1:22:04] all of you come to church and you we do
[1:22:06] the things of church right
[1:22:08] we we are we're Christians
[1:22:10] right and and we believe I hope we
[1:22:13] believe as a bride of Jesus Christ that
[1:22:16] we're it
[1:22:18] we're it
[1:22:20] there there's no other standard
[1:22:23] to live by except what me and you know
[1:22:25] right now
[1:22:26] everybody everybody with me it's not a
[1:22:28] Baptist standard
[1:22:30] you look at the Baptist now
[1:22:32] I was talking to Jeannie the other day
[1:22:34] the little girl that cuts her hair
[1:22:36] well the Methodist
[1:22:39] they're split because LGBT thing putting
[1:22:41] women in the pulpit and all that stuff
[1:22:43] and gays oh that's your business
[1:22:47] but thank God there's a group that come
[1:22:48] out could be foolish version in there
[1:22:52] all right now now that that Demon's done
[1:22:54] jumped over into the Baptist
[1:22:56] and now they're splitting because some
[1:22:59] of them are let women preach now
[1:23:00] Baptists are true Baptist
[1:23:03] I'm talking about a true bad distance
[1:23:05] Die Hard Baptist
[1:23:08] knows that a woman's not supposed to be
[1:23:10] in this bullpet
[1:23:12] called this biblical it's the Bible and
[1:23:14] that's what they built it and especially
[1:23:16] not deacons or Elders or nothing now
[1:23:19] thank God for the Baptist Church for
[1:23:21] holding on to that but remember now
[1:23:23] there's a group that's pulled out
[1:23:25] big church up here in Gainesville is
[1:23:27] letting women be us they have so many
[1:23:30] pastors they got pastors for this in the
[1:23:32] denominational world but I told Jenny
[1:23:33] she said now y'all don't believe in that
[1:23:35] I said no I said it don't take somebody
[1:23:37] to have to call me and tell me that
[1:23:39] either
[1:23:41] I don't have to get a
[1:23:45] less says either let them or don't
[1:23:49] I said Paul sent me a letter 2 000 years
[1:23:52] ago
[1:23:54] and praise God it didn't get hung up in
[1:23:56] the mail
[1:23:58] right right right
[1:24:00] he said every one of your pocket if you
[1:24:04] got a phone with a Bible on it that
[1:24:06] tells you
[1:24:07] plainly
[1:24:09] that a woman's not supposed to Ursa
[1:24:11] Penny Authority art and you know what
[1:24:13] women you ought to say praise God that's
[1:24:15] something you don't have to deal with
[1:24:16] what Jesus always say that's your summer
[1:24:18] ain't gonna worry about
[1:24:19] I may feel like I need to talk to the
[1:24:22] women or you know
[1:24:26] Like a Shepherd a group of people
[1:24:28] no I'm sorry it's not built that way
[1:24:32] we're not built to have kids
[1:24:35] you are yes
[1:24:38] so you're not built to be a pastor we
[1:24:41] are
[1:24:44] not trying to meddle but we know that we
[1:24:46] didn't come in this church to hear me
[1:24:48] give you some new doctrine that we don't
[1:24:50] believe women should be preachers
[1:24:54] Paul told us
[1:24:56] that was an old sermon
[1:24:59] that's two thousand years ago
[1:25:01] and that sermon is still there
[1:25:03] absolutely it's still in print
[1:25:06] that's what I told Jenny I said I ain't
[1:25:08] gonna have nobody send me a letter
[1:25:12] she said I think every people ought to
[1:25:13] be independent I said well
[1:25:15] where are you
[1:25:18] I didn't say that but I'd like to say
[1:25:20] that she's a good phenomenal Christian
[1:25:22] girl she just tries to live it as much
[1:25:24] as she can
[1:25:25] and Dad's talked to her a little bit and
[1:25:27] she just can't see that part but as far
[1:25:29] as a nominal Christian should go to
[1:25:31] church all the time she's just she works
[1:25:33] she works in the church does a lot of
[1:25:35] stuff but she knows her place too so she
[1:25:37] knows it doesn't matter you know I said
[1:25:39] well what about your pastor he's she
[1:25:41] said well he knows the difference
[1:25:43] did she not the woman's not supposed to
[1:25:45] preach or Usher paying the authority in
[1:25:47] church and she said we're good with that
[1:25:49] I said well now the church up here in
[1:25:52] Gainesville the big one up there they've
[1:25:54] allowed a woman to be a minister one of
[1:25:56] the Ministers of the church
[1:25:58] and that's another the southern baptist
[1:26:00] Union or whatever it is they're trying
[1:26:02] people are trying to pull away from that
[1:26:04] because of that
[1:26:06] because of a truth
[1:26:09] that they can't stand come on because
[1:26:12] it's the devil yes
[1:26:13] that's trying to give them power without
[1:26:16] character because the holy ghost-filled
[1:26:19] woman will never get In a Pulpit I only
[1:26:21] gonna feel a woman would never want to
[1:26:23] be a deacon yeah I only gonna feel woman
[1:26:25] will never want to urge her opinion
[1:26:26] Authority in a church
[1:26:29] I said a Holy Ghost
[1:26:32] and the holy ghost film
[1:26:33] know his place that's right
[1:26:36] in the church
[1:26:37] I don't know why that was free
[1:26:40] but anyway
[1:26:44] so let's look for a man brotherly
[1:26:45] kindness but it's the truth we don't
[1:26:47] have to sit here and worry whether our
[1:26:50] uh what they call them a convention if
[1:26:52] you go to a convention we're going to
[1:26:54] have a convention all right
[1:26:57] but it's going to be in the millennium
[1:26:59] we're gonna have a commission over there
[1:27:01] but we ain't got to go to a convention
[1:27:03] to figure out what we believe
[1:27:08] because it's in the Bible
[1:27:10] plainly in the Bible
[1:27:15] but you take these people like Joyce
[1:27:16] Meyers and all these different ones that
[1:27:18] are just out hugely famous
[1:27:21] and they just hang on every word for
[1:27:23] from the and she's her hair short is
[1:27:25] mine
[1:27:26] got fishing lures in there hanging over
[1:27:28] ears
[1:27:29] right Danny we seem we've seen pretty
[1:27:31] I've seen pretty efficient lures when I
[1:27:33] have some of the things they wear off I
[1:27:34] mean it just drags
[1:27:36] why would you do that because it's an
[1:27:38] anointing she's anointed
[1:27:40] she's yielded herself to a wrong
[1:27:42] anointing though
[1:27:44] sure it may be the Holy Ghost fighting
[1:27:46] her because she does read the Bible but
[1:27:48] it ain't annoying her to tell you you
[1:27:50] can cut your hair I tell you there's no
[1:27:52] way God can go against his word no ways
[1:27:56] we can put her we can put everything we
[1:27:58] have on that one thing he will never go
[1:28:01] against his word he'll never back up
[1:28:03] he'll never change it either
[1:28:08] wow
[1:28:11] but can't we just can't we just lay our
[1:28:13] lay our uh uh uh Solace on that then I
[1:28:17] don't have to go to church next Sunday
[1:28:18] and wonder whether somebody's told me
[1:28:20] that I need to let women in the pulpit
[1:28:22] or I need to let a gay or a lesbian lead
[1:28:25] my people
[1:28:30] we should be we should be ecstatic
[1:28:35] that we don't have to worry about now
[1:28:38] we've come under not just a message of
[1:28:41] the hour we come under the true Biblical
[1:28:43] word of God
[1:28:45] the true Biblical word of God where
[1:28:48] there is no and listen our sisters don't
[1:28:51] fight that listen the problem with them
[1:28:53] I say them the problem with that
[1:28:55] anointing or that that see they have an
[1:28:57] anointing of a Baptist a Baptist has an
[1:29:00] anointing Methodist has an anointing
[1:29:02] different ones they've used the word of
[1:29:03] God different ways all right we don't
[1:29:06] have uh there's not a sister I hope not
[1:29:08] sitting in this congregation this this
[1:29:09] going I sure would like to get up here
[1:29:12] because he is just so boring I I could I
[1:29:14] can say a lot better than he can
[1:29:18] well some of you are not even shaking
[1:29:20] your head
[1:29:21] some of you are like going to the
[1:29:23] chiropractor
[1:29:25] yeah
[1:29:28] I see it on Facebook anyway
[1:29:30] so
[1:29:31] but that Spirit had to pop his
[1:29:34] head up in a congregation
[1:29:37] that there is a woman sitting in the
[1:29:39] congregation that thinks that she can
[1:29:41] talk better than the guy standing in the
[1:29:42] pulpit
[1:29:44] right because that's where that come
[1:29:46] from that's where that motivation's
[1:29:48] coming from and if you don't have what
[1:29:49] now look if you don't have a strong
[1:29:51] Pastor or a strong person that stands
[1:29:54] back here to deliver the word of God
[1:29:56] guess what he's going to do
[1:29:57] well okay sister I'm thinking maybe you
[1:29:59] are a little bit more anointed than I am
[1:30:02] you step on up here and oh sister's
[1:30:05] gonna deliver the message today
[1:30:11] the only way a woman is going to stand
[1:30:13] in this pulpit
[1:30:16] is the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:30:19] and that is it
[1:30:22] I'm talking about the male part but
[1:30:25] remember we're all female in the body
[1:30:26] but now see you say that and then
[1:30:28] everybody said well now we've done bro
[1:30:30] wait you throw it all in a pot and we
[1:30:31] all come out now
[1:30:35] don't change what Paul said absolutely
[1:30:38] it does not change what Paul said Paul
[1:30:42] said and we believe it anyway brother
[1:30:45] kindness just for about two minutes
[1:30:47] and besides this giving all Dylan just
[1:30:49] add to your faith version of virtual
[1:30:51] knowledge and all his Temperance we've
[1:30:52] been through all these tempers patience
[1:30:54] the patience godliness and godliness
[1:30:55] brotherly kindness and brother kindness
[1:30:57] charity we know that Philadelphia that
[1:31:00] means brother to love and as we were
[1:31:01] talking before it's not brotherly love
[1:31:03] that turns into
[1:31:05] lust all right it's not even Brotherly
[1:31:09] Love Ophelia love at the point of you
[1:31:11] loving your wife are you loving your
[1:31:13] kids and all that everybody got that so
[1:31:16] we have to differentiate that though
[1:31:18] all right so it's love of brothers or
[1:31:20] sisters in the New Testament it's the
[1:31:22] love which Christians cherish for each
[1:31:24] other as Brethren all right
[1:31:29] that kind of goes to show you
[1:31:31] just for a minute you look over in the
[1:31:34] in the Old Testament you see Sodom and
[1:31:36] Gomorrah
[1:31:38] that's where the word sodomy comes from
[1:31:40] because and all you adults know what
[1:31:42] happened in that City
[1:31:44] all right Sodom and Gomorrah Old
[1:31:47] Testament
[1:31:48] can't control their self
[1:31:50] that's what it is just an uncontrolled
[1:31:53] passion or lust
[1:31:55] now you come over though and you come to
[1:31:57] where Jesus comes and he give us the
[1:31:59] passion of him The Passion of Christ or
[1:32:01] the love of God the agape love all right
[1:32:03] so he set the standard that's right all
[1:32:06] right first three Church ages that
[1:32:07] standard held
[1:32:10] no water baptism in the name of father
[1:32:12] son Holy Ghost no eternal hell
[1:32:15] no Trinity that all held
[1:32:18] but they lost
[1:32:20] the Bible didn't say they lost their
[1:32:22] first Doctrine
[1:32:23] what'd he say you've lost your first
[1:32:26] love
[1:32:28] you've lost your first agape
[1:32:32] in other words you've lost Jesus Christ
[1:32:34] so now it got lost so much to look at
[1:32:36] the other end of the book in you got a
[1:32:38] Sodom and Gomorrah here again
[1:32:40] amen same thing
[1:32:43] you got a Sodom and Gomorrah right here
[1:32:45] again just like that Sodom and gomor
[1:32:46] that was over there
[1:32:48] and listen that's what brother Brown
[1:32:49] said God would have to raise up that
[1:32:51] Sodom and and and apologize if you don't
[1:32:54] destroy this one right but remember he's
[1:32:56] going to take us out he even took lot
[1:32:58] was the top of the what right
[1:33:00] nominal believer yes he went top of the
[1:33:03] Bride the bride was Abraham setting up
[1:33:04] on the hill that not didn't go down
[1:33:06] there but lot made it he had to write
[1:33:08] your soul that's what the Bible says but
[1:33:11] he got took out before the destruction
[1:33:14] so everybody with me on that so God is
[1:33:17] love but love typically produces
[1:33:19] obedience and that's what we're going to
[1:33:21] talk about tonight we'll close right
[1:33:22] here come on musicians come on
[1:33:24] let's all stand and for all who refuse
[1:33:27] to repent and believe in Christ you see
[1:33:28] well I just we love everybody that's the
[1:33:31] whole thing of
[1:33:31] the sanity in the nominal world is God
[1:33:34] is love
[1:33:36] and that's what the Bible says God is
[1:33:38] love but they put no correction in it
[1:33:40] they put Power in that scripture without
[1:33:43] the character to look and say
[1:33:46] but he is a just God
[1:33:48] he's not agrees he got
[1:33:51] he gives you Grace but he doesn't give
[1:33:54] you greasy Grace
[1:33:56] for all those who refuse to repent and
[1:33:58] believe in Christ they receive Justice
[1:34:00] for those who do trust in Christ they
[1:34:03] receive what they don't deserve and
[1:34:04] that's what it is Grace and have
[1:34:06] withheld what they really did deserve
[1:34:08] which is Mercy we need mercy and Grace
[1:34:10] which side are you on do you have
[1:34:12] eternal life or do you still have the
[1:34:14] wrath of God abiding
[1:34:16] I want to say in you not on you but in
[1:34:19] you
[1:34:20] without the Holy Ghost that's what you
[1:34:22] have
[1:34:23] amen let's sing a song
[1:34:25] Matthew 24 says a love of many
[1:34:28] shall last called
[1:34:31] I have heard thy
[1:34:34] life
[1:34:36] [Music]
[1:34:37] to me
[1:34:39] [Music]
[1:34:46] and be closer
[1:34:49] to me
[1:34:52] [Music]
[1:34:57] and Lord till the cross where thou has
[1:35:02] died
[1:35:04] [Music]
[1:35:14] [Applause]
[1:35:17] [Music]
[1:35:18] consecrate me now can I serve as Lord by
[1:35:24] the power of Grace
[1:35:29] let my soul of God with a steadfast hope
[1:35:34] and my will be lost
[1:35:40] [Music]
[1:35:44] never bless the Lord till the cross
[1:35:47] where thou has died
[1:35:54] [Music]
[1:36:04] all of your dead
[1:36:10] [Music]
[1:36:17] holy prayer I am with thee my God
[1:36:23] is
[1:36:25] [Music]
[1:36:32] [Music]
[1:36:37] draw me
[1:36:41] a mirror blessed Lord
[1:36:44] to thy precious
