TRANSCRIPT
========================================
because of that the closer he gets to the seventh chapter um so he's kind of trying to trying to set the stage for that in in chapter five and we we've got to set uh verse six here let's just go to the lord in prayer before we begin our study lord we just ask we're so grateful or to be able to gather around your word this morning and we just pray lord that you'll just be with brother wade as he's studying lord and bless the services today and bless our study now as we go through your word here and may it be profitable to us we pray in your name amen so verse 6 says as he saith also in another place thou art a priest forever after the order of melchizedek and you know you know when you study study things out paul start kind of bringing keto phrases out that relate to one another and and one of those is in verse 7 who in the days of his flesh so he's talking about melchizedek that talked to abraham and then he jumps over to talk about jesus christ uh who in the days of his flesh there you know praying in the garden of gethsemane i've got a little picture of jesus praying in the garden of gethsemane and and really you know think of his whole life that the suffering and and the things that he went through who in the days of his flesh when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death and was heard and that he feared so of course now now paul is comparing christ to is a high priest not after the order of aaron a man that would just like us they could what could die and uh you know what like the differ the difference between the order of air and the new order of melchizedek is the order of melchizedek is god revealed in flesh so that's what the point he's trying to make in verse seven who in the days of his flesh in the days of his flesh that's that's that same god now that talked to abraham now he's uh packaged up bottled up in that in that flesh man that was crying out to god in the garden of gethsemane so paul's making a point that you know jesus learned obedience he he was made perfect by the things that he suffered and we also are going to have to be made perfect and he begins to talk about perfection and and and how we also are all going to suffer that god wants us to suffer because he's molding us and making us into the image of of a perfect man of christ jesus and so in the smyrna in church asian chapter four brother brahma said in plain language the very character of jesus was perfected by suffering and according to paul he has left his church a measure of suffering that they too by their faith in god while suffering for him would come to a place of perfection so that's what paul's speaking of when he says in verse eight though he were a son yet learned the obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him so brother branham quotes james chapter one he says my brother encountered all joy when you fall into divers temptations knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience but let patience have her perfect work that you may be perfect and entire wanting nothing i see when you can begin to realize what your but god's want wants the desire for god in your life that he wants you to be to be perfect then it changes your outlook when you begin to realize that the things that you go through in life are are are for that end your for your perfection i was talking to somebody the other day about how a lot of times when you go to work you're surrounded by people that complain about everything complaining about their boss and playing about the things that they're they're doing and but yet you are a real christian in the workplace they realize that sometimes it's going to be hard and sometimes you're going to have to have hard tasks and you know no matter not just in your work but in your you know if you if you have suffering in your body there's a purpose for that but god is god is bringing you to a place where you trust in him and have confidence in him so you know it changes your outlook it'll change your outlook of a christian when you're in the workplace and you you don't look at things as just some kind of a burden anymore but you're trying to do the very best you can because you're trying to serve an almighty god so the word perfect paul said and being made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation and to all them that obey him the per that word perfect kind of stumbles us sometimes because we think well how can i how can i be perfect and we look at all of our frailties and our mistakes and things but what perfect here means is that word tell you i don't know if i'm pronouncing that right but it means to to to finish like you you're you're molding some out of clay or making a pot or like a potter and when it's finished off it's going to be polished it's going to be glazed it's going to be set aside it's going to go through the the furnace and be uh go through the fire of of troubles and suffering and things and after that comes out you can put it into use and it's going to be it's going to be finished and there the finished work so to to perfect in this sense means to to finish to fulfill to be perfect to consecrate or that that bullet number one to make perfect complete to carry through completely to accomplish finish bring to an end and that bullet number four to accomplish bring to a close or fulfillment by event the prophecies of the scriptures so there's you know there's prophecies prophecies that god is fulfilling in your life and of course we know we know that we know our purpose our purpose in this age is to come to adoption our purpose in this age is to come to a full complete oneness with christ where where we're just all of the world is baked out of us all of our denominational ideas and our old worldly thinking is baked out of us until god looks at us and says that they're acting just like i am they're they're thinking like i am and they're doing like i am and i can really use this person in a way that i wasn't able to use anybody like the way that i wanted to all down through the seven church ages because now in this age i can perfect somebody and how is it going to perfect us by the word so paul's talking about he being made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him now you think so he became the author of eternal salvation and and you compare that with hebrews 12 verses 2 that we're getting to eventually and that says looking unto jesus the author the author means he started he started the book he started the process and the finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and set down at the right hand of the throne of god so he's the finisher and in this sense finish finisher means i've got a picture of of somebody getting they've got a polisher and they're polishing up some steel that they they've made in a factory maybe it's kind of hard to see in this picture because i didn't have much room to put that on the slide but you know finishing finishing sometimes is a little bit rough when you get that polisher out and you're you're you're holding it down grinding away stuff and and getting all the all the stuff that ain't supposed to be there away and but but when you're done then you'll be able to hold that that steel up that they're polishing and see the author's reflection in it and you can it's you'll be like a mirror that you can hold hold it up to the word of god and say well what i read in the scripture is i'm actually living out in my life and and and that's what perfection means perfection is perfection means to come to maturity so so perfection here in in the uh the finisher that the definition there in the greek word means to moral and spiritual perfection so growing up from from a little baby up to up to a man and you you think about the the final state the perfection of jesus's life the maturity of his life wound up with him given everything just laying everything down in the garden of gethsemane laying everything down and going up and dying on that cross and that's really what your perfection winds up in as well as you lay down everything of your own life right you lay down all of your will and all of your desires and just become like a like a bride adorned for a husband that lays down everything at her husband's feet and says i'm willing to be subject to you whatever you want me to be i'm willing to do it so jesus was called of god and high priest after the order of melchizedek after the order now that sometimes paul you really gotta think about the things and meditate on the things that he's saying because they're so they're so deep and rich like a little uh like a treasure chest that you open up and it's packed full of wonderful treats and so you think meditate on the after the order of melchizedek and the order of melchizedek is is different from the order of aaron the order of aaron where a man could die and and and then you have to give the give the priesthood over to us his son or whoever would be next and and on and on but the order of melchizedek is god coming down and revealing himself in flesh yes so that's the order we're talking about so in hebrews chapter 6 verse chapter 6 part 3 that brother ram preached back in 1957 he said what came to pass one day down there when abraham was sitting in his tent when abraham was sitting in his tent god came up to him in a body of flesh oh you say brother graham he was we'll find out here meeting abraham before that in the order of melchizedek a body of flesh which was god sure it was he was god in flesh you say then brother branham why would he have to come back and be born he wasn't born he was just created a body that he dwelt in melchizedek was the king of salem which is the king of jerusalem which is the king of peace which had neither father nor mother beginning of days or ending of life jesus had both father and mother in the beginning of days and ending of life but he was made after the order of melchizedek which had no beginning of days or ending of life melchizedek was god himself melchizedek was jehovah god the same one that met abraham years later in front of his tent so i i'm just kind of diving in skimming the surface of this before we dive into it a lot more in hebrews chapter 7 but just to begin to think upon the the fact of the matter that jesus was god in flesh just as melchizedek that came to abraham was god in flesh so paul's saying call of god and high priest after the order of melchizedek of whom we have many things to say he wanted to say a lot about melchizedek and that's a very deep topic that was a very deep topic for them back there in that age when they were sitting there and people are falling sleeping in his sermons like that man that fell asleep in and uh he had to he pray over him and raise him from the dead but paul wanted to say a lot about him of whom we have many things to say and hard to be uttered seeing you are dull of hearing now that's something to think about that they would be dull of hearing back there in that lying age when the word began to go forth and its full authority and power and but you know dull of hearing if we just examine that that what that means is it's slow and sluggish and indolent and dull and languid you see i've got a little picture over there somebody that's indolent saying this is the most amount of work you do your laziness can be called indolence an indolent person somebody's that's dull of hearing as they say they just they're not too interested they just kind of think well we're you know it's melchizedek why why we have to why would we want to know about that paul said for when for the time you ought to be teachers you ought to be able to share with other people what you know about these things you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of god and have become such as have need of milk and not of strong meat see he's saying that you know you got to start off with your abcs you got to start off with just just the basics but there comes a time when you should be able to understand algebra you know i i i this this is not the best i i feel like sometimes the problem that we we struggle with when you look at this example of algebra is that sometimes it makes you think well you got to be like really smart or something to understand the message but i want to maybe stress that you don't have to be you don't have to have a college degree because the message can be understand by somebody like peter who preached in ii peter 1 about the statue of a perfect man it can be understand understood by the unlearned the unscholarly or whatever it can be understood is it's as simple as you plant a corn of wheat in the ground and it grows and grows and grows and if you just plant that wheat that corn wheat in the ground it's going to come up but the understanding he's talking about he what he's really talking about is do you have a desire to understand you you ought to be at the place where you understand he's saying you you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of god so again what's paul talking about he's talking about bringing us to perfection and the only way that you're going to come to perfection to full oneness with god is if you have that desire in you to to to know and and you want you want to know more about god and you eat that word and you take it in until you become that so in the seal of the christ brother brown said if we have served the lord you christians all these years this time we were getting off of a milk diet time we were able to eat some strong meat the strong meat is here for us and the holy spirit will feed it to us if we'll only open up and let him do it and in the uncertain sound he said won't you please father take each one of them into lie loving care and give them of the sincere milk of the gospel now and if they have already taken that may they receive strong meat now and become full christians never know more to tattle with the world and indulge in the world but be real men and women believing the certain sound that the gospel is true no matter who says it's not so now he's saying give them of the sincere milk of the gospel we need we need milk but now once you have milk then it's time to go on towards some meat now what is meat what what is meat now so meat now if we could just take i mean some examples in the scripture of meat romans 8 that talks about your growth romans 8 that talks with that brother brother wade's been preaching on romans 8 that's that's that's some meaty stuff that talks about how you you come forth crying out of a father and then you he you're you're growing on up to manifested sons and until we all come to the adoption to with the redemption of the body uh ii peter 1 talking about the statue of perfect man ephesians 4 that talks about how that god gave gifts into the church to bring you he gave the apostles prophets and and so forth to bring you up into the full stature of a perfect man to bring you up into that luke 17 all those things are prophecies of the coming of the son of man well what is the son of man see you're getting into that's a meat that that a little baby is not going to be able to understand now but i want to i want to stress too that you know we will say sometimes when somebody new comes into the church or what what not we'll say well you know you you don't want to give them the seven seal book because that's that's meat and so you don't give a baby meat because it takes a while for them to grow up to that so a little baby a baby needs a broken up a little bit more in matthew chapter 24 that talks about the seals and daniel 9 and daniel 70 weeks and hebrews 7 that we've been reading and who is this melchizedek who is that who was that melchizedek how do you what is what is the importance of melchizedek and the whole book of revelation that's strong meat where you can begin to talk about the seven churches and the seven spirits before god and seven trumpets and seven vials and all those things that's that's meat and that's good that's what's gonna make a perfect church a strong church is when you can get into meat and you talk about the sermons that brother and preached that were meaty the meaty sermons the third exodus what's that why christ speak and perfect faith and the token and the super sign and who is this melchizedek and god identifying himself by his own characteristics they identified christ of all ages and birth pains and the seed shall not be aired with the shuck and the choosing of a bride and spiritual food and due season and the invisible union of the bride of christ that's some meat that's a meat that somebody can a a a a mature christian could eat on and get something out of but right you know babies babies are wonderful we love babies we we don't you know we're we're not a church where we like look down on babies because you know you know when you're if you're uh your grandparent in here or a new parent you you get that little baby in your arms and it's it's just wonderful when they go to cooling and stuff and and the smells of a baby and everything is wonderful we love babies and everybody starts off as a baby when uh when uh when a new when you got a new a new convert in church when your kids get born again and they're a little new little baby and they're just hungry for the word that's all they can talk about oh that's excellent that's that's fantastic so we're not we're not against babies the thing is you you gotta go just don't stay as a baby we love babies and babies are wonderful in the church because you know you get a baby crying out and everything and it just it'll stir up things it'll change the atmosphere in church they get to maybe moving in the service and stuff and responding everybody starts off as a baby even jesus started off as a baby you know you think about him crying in that manger as a little baby and how how cute he was and how you know he swallowed up in them swaddling claws and making little baby noises and everything but yet his purpose in life was to hang on that cross was not to be a baby so it's great when you have a little baby but but but we want to get beyond the baby station how how do you how do you grow how do you how do you change from a baby to a man all you got to do is keep eating so now now let's maybe just compare spiritual so paul's talking about let's not forget what we're talking about what paul is talking about he says for everyone that is useful you everyone that uses the milk is unskillful and the word of righteousness for he is a babe everyone that uses milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness in other words they don't they don't quite have a home down there they're you know they're they're they're hungering and they're they're trying to get things worked out and they don't quite know how to use that sword yet it's kind of maybe a little heavy in their arm and they don't quite know how to what what how how to block and how to dodge and the difference between some of the the you know different doctrines and things they're a little baby and so you look at you look at the characteristics of a baby maybe natural and spiritual just to kind of compare what's paul talking about a baby a baby's gonna get their feelings hurt real easy because you know you take a little lollipop away from a baby versus taking a lollipop away from a man take a lollipop away from a baby and they're going to cry and it's going to hurt their feelings you take a lollipop away from a man and they'll say well i got another lollipop if you want that one too that's the difference between a real a mature person and a baby a little bit a little baby is going to get their feelings hurt oh so so you know you sometimes you have to deal with little babies differently than you do with a mature whatever mature person because a baby's gonna they cry a lot a baby baby will cry a lot they don't quite know how they're not it they're not you know speaking conditions or maturity yet they're they're they get their feelings hurt and they go running back to papa and crying about it and things and or mama and they're always wanting their way oh i i think it should be this way hello a little baby now we're talking about a a little baby that they want their they want their diaper changed right then they want their they want their food when they get hungry they got to have somebody over there cramming that food in their mouth and if they if there's not somebody to spoon feed them then they get upset real easy hey give me that food i want it right now i remember when my when my kids were esther was the one she would uh if you didn't have that food in her mouth as soon as you put it in her mouth and you better be right you better be quick or she was gonna pitch a fit but but now now she can feed herself it's different now and more baby little babies are more concerned with their own comfort they come for than others a little baby can't put a blanket on you or something they don't want that blanket on them a little baby wants you to take care of them they want you to change their diaper and they want you to put that passy in their mouth they're not in the place yet where they can they can help you do with anything and see what a what a spiritual baby does too you see by looking at that at the natural and a little baby can't express themselves well all they know how to do is cry but now like a grown man or a grown woman they can say i'd feel tired or i you know i believe that god is going to heal my body and they can speak it but a little baby they can't quite they they're they're having trouble expressing themselves and they they hardly don't have any self-control they'll just something don't go their way and they'll just pitch a little tantrum you see what a little baby does and a baby lacks understanding they they don't quite fully discern a lot of times a little baby or or even on up beyond babies i think they're going on into the pre-teen years and teenagers and stuff they think they know right from wrong but they they don't they don't they need some guidance they need some help and see that's why we need deacons in the church and you've got ministers to watch and you got your mom and daddy to watch over and things did now hold on now did you think about this before cause they're lacking under they'd like an understanding like like evil did in the garden she thought she knew she thought she had an understanding of what was right and wrong and the devil got it over on her and little babies are not yet ready for responsibility responsibility is when responsibility is when somebody can say so your parents or whoever your boss your boss can step back and say you are responsible for getting that done you're responsible for leading songs in the church you're responsible for preaching a sermon you're responsible for teaching a sunday school lesson you're responsible for raising a family whatever it is you can't give responsibility to a little baby because they they're not going to be able to do it and a little baby just they trip and fall all the time they trip and fall and you know they they need their mom and daddy to be there to pick them up again and when they fall and you think about a spiritual little baby too they're constantly tripping and falling because you know if you trip and fall what you do you just get right back up again and maybe you cry a little bit as a little baby maybe you cry oh god forgive me and and and you just get back up and you keep going again but little babies are going to keep tripping and falling a lot and they need help to eat they need help to you know get that like a little baby bird get the food broken down and and so it's real easy to digest um and so you can so it'll help you and you know they just can't digest that they can't digest table food they need that that pureed that squashed up mashed potatoes and all that kind of stuff because they just can't eat the steak here but now how to get them how do you get a little baby to maturity and we're almost out of time here you just feed them meat you feed them feed them food strong meat belongs to them that are of full age even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil so i got a little picture of an eagle here eating and a college student because what how did that college student get there is they exercised they exercised what they were hearing in school they studied they practiced now how do you get to full maturity as you're eating reading reading the message and reading the bible and you're hearing the preaching of the word you go home and you start applying that to your life and you say you know i i got this thing in my life i want to get rid of i believe i'm gonna you know i'm gonna start believing and you start exercising your faith and you start exercising you exercising to discern both good and evil and you you start practicing and problems in your life come along and and and and you you you uh you look as square in the face and you say i'm not accepting this lie of the devil the devil's trying to give me sickness in my body or a messed up home life or whatever but you know what i'm just going to pack this word in and i'm going to believe and confess what christ has already said and i believe that he's going to change my life and changed my body and changed my family and changed my home and you begin to grow in maturity and what it is what's doing that is the food that you're eating just like a little baby and the musicians can come go ahead and come forward the food and that's where that's where you get get to a place where you can eat that meat that god wanted you to eat all this time he he maybe allowed you to eat a little baby food at first but what he wanted you to do is get to a place where you could eat strong meat and we'll stop right there [Applause] then [Music]
