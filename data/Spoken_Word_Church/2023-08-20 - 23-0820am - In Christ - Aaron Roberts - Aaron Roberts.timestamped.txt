[8:34] this morning
[8:40] I just want to I want to say that uh
[8:44] for some of you that that don't know we
[8:49] we're in the Conyers last night and they
[8:53] had to
[8:54] that some of you knew about the message
[8:55] Believers Youth Choir
[8:57] did anybody know
[8:59] brother Michael did it's supposed to be
[9:02] on YouTube if you get a chance y'all to
[9:03] listen to it we were brother Daniel
[9:05] Gibson danders Church hosted it this
[9:07] year and they were in Conyers at a
[9:09] different Church
[9:10] and my brother Jack Duff was the one
[9:13] that was the I guess to be the MC of the
[9:15] the service and brother Isaiah Brooks
[9:19] and Believers from Trinidad and
[9:21] man I tell you what we had a good time
[9:23] last night
[9:24] and as brother dick always had always
[9:27] quoted me if that didn't stir your soul
[9:29] your spoon fell out of your bowl
[9:30] we had a good time last night
[9:34] and
[9:35] I tell you what we you know
[9:38] God inhabits the Praises of his people
[9:41] and we had a wonderful time last night
[9:43] and uh I just got thinking about they
[9:45] sang that song last night your goodness
[9:47] is running after me
[9:51] and I just
[9:54] it's hard to contain it
[9:56] and uh
[9:58] I was just I was just overflowing
[10:00] you know
[10:02] we wonder why things happen the way they
[10:04] do in life but
[10:07] you know today is the is the third third
[10:09] anniversary of my dad
[10:11] going home
[10:12] my dad's graduation
[10:16] and
[10:18] I thank the Lord for for my dad
[10:21] and who he was
[10:23] and
[10:26] one of the things I want to look at
[10:28] maybe this morning but
[10:30] he uh
[10:32] he made me and who I was
[10:36] you know I didn't have to uh I didn't
[10:39] have to grow into anything
[10:43] I just look like him
[10:45] I act like him people say I sound like
[10:47] him
[10:48] well you know I didn't I didn't have to
[10:50] manufacture any of that
[10:52] I didn't take one class to practice that
[10:54] I never stood in the mirror
[10:57] because you know what it's not an
[10:59] impersonation
[11:00] it's a manifestation
[11:04] and if I can do the same thing with my
[11:06] heavenly father
[11:09] if the life he said if the same spirit
[11:11] that raised up Jesus from the dead
[11:14] dwell in you
[11:16] you'll do the same things
[11:19] he said when I
[11:21] come and take up our the father and I
[11:23] take it by our boat in you
[11:25] then you do the same things
[11:29] and so
[11:31] it's a wonderful thing this morning
[11:34] to know who we are who our father is and
[11:36] what God has done for us
[11:39] hey man if you have your Bibles we're
[11:40] going to look into II Corinthians
[11:42] chapter five
[11:44] and verse 14.
[11:46] and also uh today is Janine's birthday I
[11:50] don't know if they told you over then
[11:52] anybody mention
[11:54] and I'm not going to tell you how old
[11:55] she is
[11:58] she'll tell you
[12:01] but I appreciate the Lord
[12:03] you know
[12:05] Janine talked about many times about
[12:07] moving back you know moving down here
[12:09] and
[12:10] and
[12:12] you know what the Lord works out when
[12:14] you have the desire but you don't see
[12:16] the plan how God will work things out
[12:20] you just put your trust in the Lord he
[12:22] knows how to work things out
[12:24] he knows where you need to be at
[12:28] the only thing we have to do is just
[12:30] follow the leading of the Lord
[12:32] and
[12:34] people always ask me do I uh
[12:37] that ever have to take care of my sister
[12:39] growing up
[12:40] that I ever have to look out for I don't
[12:42] know
[12:44] when I was in high school had people
[12:46] tell me said Aaron we'd rather fight you
[12:48] because you know when to stop
[12:54] so I didn't have I didn't have to take
[12:56] care of her I might have had to pull her
[12:58] off of somebody when I have to I end up
[13:00] pulling nobody off of her
[13:03] but I appreciate the Lord and his mercy
[13:06] and his grace
[13:07] his goodness has followed us surely
[13:10] goodness and mercy will follow me all
[13:12] the days of my life
[13:14] and I will dwell in the house of the
[13:15] Lord forever
[13:17] we will
[13:18] so he knows where we need to be at and
[13:20] what we have need of I'm so thankful
[13:22] he's mindful of us
[13:24] hey man let's just read the scripture
[13:25] here
[13:28] second Corinthians chapter 5 verse 14
[13:31] says For the Love of Christ constraineth
[13:33] us because we thus judge that if one
[13:36] died for all then we're all dead
[13:39] and that he died for all that day which
[13:42] live should not henceforth live unto
[13:44] themselves but unto him which died for
[13:47] them and rose again wherefore henceforth
[13:50] know we no man after the flesh
[13:53] see Christ is not known after the flesh
[13:56] yea though we have known Christ after
[13:58] the flesh
[14:00] see Paul didn't know Jesus in the flesh
[14:05] but he had a carnal understanding of who
[14:08] Christ was
[14:10] and many people only see Christ by a
[14:14] carnal understanding
[14:16] he said yet now his forth know we him no
[14:20] more
[14:22] and so when he said all that then he
[14:24] says therefore
[14:26] see we don't say therefore If any man be
[14:28] in Christ he is a new creature
[14:31] because old things are passed away
[14:33] behold all things are become new
[14:36] and all things are of God who hath
[14:39] reconciled us to him by Jesus Christ and
[14:42] hath given to us the ministry of
[14:44] reconciliation to wit that God was in
[14:46] Christ reconciling the world to himself
[14:49] unto himself not imputing their
[14:51] trespasses unto them and hath committed
[14:54] unto us the word of reconciliation so
[14:57] now we have been reconciled to God
[15:01] but what is the second part of that
[15:06] we have been given the word of
[15:08] reconciliation
[15:10] do you know that if the world's going to
[15:13] see Jesus Christ they're going to see
[15:14] Jesus Christ in you
[15:16] the word of reconciliation has been
[15:18] given to you
[15:21] so we are the ones to show the world
[15:23] Jesus Christ
[15:25] for he hath made him to be sin for us
[15:28] who knew no sin that we might be made
[15:31] the righteousness of God in him amen God
[15:35] bless you this morning you can have your
[15:37] seats
[15:39] and I'm
[15:41] I entitled this message in Christ
[15:43] because he said if we be in Christ
[15:47] then we are a new creature a new
[15:49] creation in Christ and old things have
[15:52] passed away and behold all things have
[15:54] become new
[15:56] and I want to look at uh to this morning
[15:59] I want to look at a few things about the
[16:00] the Apostle Paul and his and his
[16:03] ministry and I was I'd been reading this
[16:07] little uh
[16:08] excerpt and uh I thought was real
[16:12] interesting how they they were talking
[16:14] about Paul's Ministry and and you know
[16:17] everybody has their questions of and uh
[16:22] some of this will relate to the message
[16:24] but you know they they take the things
[16:26] that they look at and they talk about
[16:28] Paul's Ministry and and they begin to
[16:31] look at the things that Paul wrote about
[16:33] well you know the one thing that Paul
[16:36] wrote about in in the scripture when he
[16:38] was writing the scripture and we know
[16:39] that it was all come from God because
[16:41] God given the word Paul didn't write his
[16:43] own message Paul Paul wasn't Paul was
[16:46] just the Scribe because the Holy Spirit
[16:48] was the one that come to Paul to write
[16:50] what he had but what Paul was writing
[16:52] about Paul was writing about his
[16:54] experiences he had an experience and
[16:57] that's what he wrote about he knew what
[16:59] he was writing about something that took
[17:01] place in his life
[17:03] and I you know many times people ask
[17:05] about why did Paul not write about this
[17:07] or Paul didn't write about that why
[17:09] because that was not Paul's Revelation
[17:11] that was not Paul's experience Paul's
[17:13] writing about his experience and Paul
[17:15] writes the same experience that he had
[17:17] as the rest of the church because one of
[17:20] the things that uh we'll get into is you
[17:22] know Peter and James and John the
[17:24] disciples those they had they actually
[17:27] slept with Jesus they ate with Jesus
[17:29] they walked with Jesus all of those
[17:31] things that they had a personal
[17:32] experience with the flesh Jesus the man
[17:35] that walked on the shores of Galilee
[17:37] they knew that man but Paul never knew
[17:40] that man Paul never had an understanding
[17:43] like Peter did
[17:45] but he said see he began to talk about
[17:47] the experiences that he had the
[17:49] understanding that he was given and this
[17:52] is from the message that God had
[17:53] explained brother random speaking here
[17:55] and he's speaking he says and Paul he
[17:58] goes here to King Agrippa and Festus and
[18:01] he said I was once of you I was the
[18:02] Pharisee of Pharisees
[18:04] he said it come up under Camellia the
[18:07] great teacher and he knew and note all
[18:08] their rules and regulations and just
[18:10] what they believed and what they did not
[18:13] believe and said even I persecuted the
[18:15] Church of God unto death he said so he
[18:18] said the very thing that I'm in question
[18:20] about I was a persecutor of
[18:24] and he said and he talks about this
[18:26] death of Stephen you know that's laid
[18:28] such heaviness on Paul all of his life
[18:31] because what had taken place
[18:33] and brother Brown goes on he said well
[18:35] you know you can kill a messenger but
[18:37] you can never kill his message
[18:40] it's if it's real and the message though
[18:42] Stephen was gone on to stand with Jesus
[18:45] yet his message lingered on Kyle's Pig
[18:48] Paul kept talking about it and what he's
[18:51] leased to them and he wasn't worthy to
[18:52] be called one because he had witnessed
[18:54] and gave his consent to rid this godly
[18:57] man this Godly person so when he began
[19:00] to talk about the things that he had
[19:01] seen but he never could get rid of that
[19:03] because it was it was a part therefore
[19:06] Paul like all men before men should do
[19:09] Paul takes his experience back from the
[19:12] beginning to what he was and then places
[19:15] it and bases it upon the scripture to
[19:17] show that what he was doing was
[19:19] scriptural
[19:21] though it was contrary to their belief
[19:23] and yet he was showing them that it was
[19:26] the scripture
[19:27] and so that is what we are to do is to
[19:30] take it back to the scripture now when
[19:32] Paul begins to talk about the things
[19:34] that he had been through you know Peter
[19:35] could explain different things that had
[19:38] his experience and things that he had
[19:40] been through and all the the different
[19:41] things about walking with Jesus and
[19:43] everything but you know Paul had the
[19:45] experience that the New Testament Church
[19:47] had
[19:49] and see that's the reason Paul writes
[19:51] about see if we understand the grace of
[19:54] God the love of God has been expressed
[19:56] to us has been shout abroad to us then
[19:58] when we are to receive this word then we
[20:01] don't follow Christ after the flesh we
[20:04] don't try to follow what Jesus done
[20:06] after the flesh because we follow him
[20:09] after the spirit because if we see what
[20:12] has taken place then we have become
[20:14] through the Life of Christ that has been
[20:17] shed that if we've received that then
[20:19] when we receive that then you know we
[20:20] become a new creature a new creation in
[20:23] Christ Jesus that we're not following
[20:25] him after the flesh because you know the
[20:27] flesh will never never amount to
[20:29] anything he said the letter killeth but
[20:32] the spirit is what gives life and we can
[20:35] take the life that Jesus lived because
[20:37] it's no longer him living and trying to
[20:39] follow like they did in the Old
[20:41] Testament trying to live the law and try
[20:43] to express all this thing from a from an
[20:46] understanding from an intellectual
[20:47] standpoint but it takes the life liked
[20:50] inside when the when the life takes it
[20:52] comes on the inside when it becomes
[20:54] expressed from the inside then you know
[20:56] what you don't have to worry about it
[20:57] because it will Express itself because
[21:00] it's when it's on the inside and it
[21:02] becomes a manifestation you know because
[21:04] then all of a sudden see when when Peter
[21:06] and Paul and the disciples when they
[21:09] live their life you know they looked at
[21:10] what Jesus was doing they didn't
[21:12] understand all those things but you know
[21:14] what there came a day when they did
[21:16] understand those things there was a day
[21:18] that they understood why because the one
[21:20] that done those things was on the inside
[21:22] and it began to manifest those things
[21:25] and they began to understand why because
[21:27] all of a sudden then they began to do
[21:29] the same things that Jesus done
[21:38] and this is from the message the
[21:40] absolute
[21:41] and he's talking about we all need to
[21:43] have talk about Daniel and everyone's
[21:45] everybody has needs absolute he said
[21:47] Paul had one too
[21:49] we are reading about it he had a
[21:51] christ-centered call and that was his
[21:53] absolute that's the reason he wasn't
[21:54] afraid of what agripple would say
[21:56] standing there in Agrippa was
[21:58] a Jew as you know and so then when he
[22:01] was standing before the Kings and things
[22:03] God had already told him that he would
[22:06] be there
[22:07] so he had an absolute so he told exactly
[22:11] the heavenly vision he said I was not
[22:13] disobedient to it or dishonorable to it
[22:17] did not misjudge it I didn't misbehave
[22:20] myself but he had to and was not
[22:23] disobeded he carried it out to the
[22:25] minute for it was an absolute in any
[22:27] christ-centered life that's your
[22:29] absolute
[22:31] now he says now since meeting him face
[22:34] to face on the road to Damascus that was
[22:37] meant so much that was so meant so much
[22:39] to Paul
[22:40] now remember he was a scholar beforehand
[22:42] he was a mighty man in the scriptures
[22:43] but he didn't have any tie posts but the
[22:47] Sanhedrin that would back him up and had
[22:50] a diploma from a great teacher he was a
[22:53] great man in his field but he was
[22:55] waiting
[22:56] only thing he had his absolute would
[22:58] have only been as strong as as
[23:01] organization was
[23:04] that's all the stronger he could be and
[23:06] he was working faithful to that and was
[23:08] talking taking Christians and binding
[23:11] them and making Havoc of them and even
[23:13] Stone Stephen
[23:15] and I think later in his life the
[23:17] reasons he went to Jerusalem when he was
[23:18] the prophet he told him don't go up
[23:20] there Paul for chains in prison waits
[23:22] for you but Paul said I know it but I'm
[23:25] not going to Jerusalem but I'm not going
[23:27] to Jerusalem as a witness I'm going
[23:29] there I'm ready to die for Jesus Christ
[23:32] for he knew what he had done and his
[23:35] ambition was to seal his testimony with
[23:39] his own blood die of martyr because he
[23:41] killed one of God's martyrs
[23:44] and he said any look and he continues on
[23:48] and see what he talks about going on the
[23:50] road to Damascus and and seeing those
[23:52] things and he says and he looked up
[23:55] when he had the
[23:58] when the light struck him down on the
[24:01] road to Damascus he looked up and he saw
[24:02] that light shining that blinded his eyes
[24:04] and what a strange thing it was no one
[24:07] else saw the light just saw
[24:10] it was so promised so real to him until
[24:12] it blinded his eyes he couldn't see
[24:14] totally blind with that pillar fire
[24:16] blazing him right in the face and he
[24:19] knew of he heard a voice saying salsa
[24:21] why persecute us thou me he said Lord
[24:23] who are you he said I am Jesus
[24:27] and it's hard for you to kick against
[24:29] these Pricks right now and go to
[24:30] Damascus and there will be one sent to
[24:32] you then when he raised up from there
[24:34] there was one a prophet down in the city
[24:37] who saw the vision while he was praying
[24:38] came ananias came and come into Saul
[24:42] laid his hands upon him and he was
[24:44] healed by the Divine Healing he rose
[24:46] then and was baptized washing away his
[24:48] sins calling upon the name of the Lord
[24:49] and then he had an absolute he was never
[24:52] the same after that he went straight
[24:54] from church to church and placed a place
[24:56] trying to build up that which he had
[24:58] tried to tear down
[25:01] and so we see how you understand Paul's
[25:05] life and you know one of the things that
[25:07] they talk about was you know Paul was
[25:09] not the one even though he was this
[25:11] great alerted man and he understood the
[25:12] Old Testament they all understand all
[25:14] these things yeah you never find Paul
[25:16] writing about Jesus in a manger you
[25:19] never understood saying understanding
[25:21] how I'm talking about Isaiah and the
[25:23] different prophecies that Jesus would
[25:25] fulfill you never underst you never hear
[25:27] him talking about all those things you
[25:30] never even though he was a Jew you never
[25:31] hear Paul talking about the lineage of
[25:34] Joseph and Mary you never even talk
[25:35] about any of those things but the one
[25:37] thing he talks about was that Christ was
[25:39] a propitiation for our sins that he was
[25:43] the fullness that he was the fullness of
[25:44] the godhead bodily that he was the image
[25:47] of the Invincible God so when he came he
[25:49] was the one that was to fulfill why was
[25:51] he to fulfilled not the Old Testament
[25:54] scriptures and and all the Old Testament
[25:56] but he was to be what what he was to the
[25:59] bride what he was to the message of the
[26:01] the people of that day are the people of
[26:03] that age was that he was their sacrifice
[26:06] he was the one that was to bridge the
[26:09] gap between God and man he was the
[26:11] Fulfillment of that to bring them into
[26:13] the fellowship of Jesus Christ that's
[26:15] who that Paul began to talk about why
[26:17] because it was not because Paul had all
[26:20] those years of learning and understood
[26:22] the Old Testament and understood all
[26:23] those great things but you know what
[26:25] when the Holy Ghost came and struck him
[26:27] down on the road to Damascus when he
[26:29] took the word they had to spend three
[26:31] years reading the Old Testament again
[26:33] because then he began to see Christ
[26:36] all those years and understood all those
[26:38] things but it but in that one moment
[26:40] when he was struck down then something
[26:42] changed in his life and it took him
[26:44] three years to get to the place that he
[26:45] needed to be
[26:48] see it takes why because he took him
[26:50] back to the word and all of a sudden the
[26:51] word began to open his brother Bob was
[26:53] talking about this morning to see when
[26:54] you get into work it begins open you
[26:56] start to walk forward and keep going
[26:58] forward and it becomes open to you you
[27:00] begin to dig into the word and it
[27:01] becomes real to you
[27:07] brother Branham says that you know why
[27:09] why do we have so much struggle why do
[27:11] we have so much problems why because we
[27:13] don't give people to a new birth
[27:17] all right well because you know what if
[27:19] you had a life-changing experience and
[27:21] you know what somebody ought to see the
[27:23] life that's changed
[27:25] [Applause]
[27:30] you got to think here's a here's a
[27:33] Pharisee of the Pharisees here's a man
[27:34] that had real zeal
[27:36] but because you know he had sold out his
[27:39] entire life to the word of the day
[27:42] well because he thought he was doing
[27:44] exactly what God had called him to do to
[27:46] persecute the church well we got to get
[27:48] rid of all these religious zealots
[27:50] they're not following the law they're
[27:51] making a mockery of it
[27:54] and you know what and you know I hate it
[27:56] well you know what they just they just
[27:58] believed they were the way they want to
[27:59] and I'm going to believe the way I want
[28:00] to
[28:03] that wasn't Paul's idea
[28:07] y'all were Jews
[28:09] circumcised
[28:11] y'all know the law
[28:13] you know some hags off the backside of
[28:16] the desert somewhere so y'all y'all grew
[28:19] up in this message
[28:22] in the message y'all y'all know what the
[28:25] law is y'all come in in the temple all
[28:27] every single week y'all know the law you
[28:30] have kept all of the feast days y'all
[28:32] done all that kind of stuff and now
[28:33] you're out here making this well you
[28:35] bunch of crazy people out here running
[28:37] around talking about some guy that
[28:39] raised from the dead and all these kind
[28:41] of things all doing all this other stuff
[28:43] you know what Paul's like we got to get
[28:44] rid of this
[28:47] are really good
[28:50] we're not letting it we're not letting
[28:51] this stuff go already
[28:53] like Barney Fife said we got nipping in
[28:55] the bud
[28:56] we gotta get rid of this
[29:00] hey you know I had real zeal
[29:03] because you know what when Stephen was
[29:04] stoned when see honestly I may be wrong
[29:07] I don't know
[29:09] but maybe it was Paul that was out there
[29:11] and he was the one that stirred those
[29:12] men up
[29:14] maybe it was Paul that was down there
[29:16] saying we got to get rid of these people
[29:18] Michael do you not see this
[29:21] and when they sing all this you know
[29:23] it's like well you know what they got
[29:24] all worked up and it's like we're gonna
[29:25] we're gonna do something about it so
[29:27] they went out there and got some stones
[29:31] especially when Steven got out there and
[29:32] said you're uncircumcised a stiff-necked
[29:34] in heart to believe all the scripture
[29:37] well when Stephen took them right back
[29:39] to the scripture he took them back to
[29:40] the Old Testament to show what Jesus had
[29:43] done that Jesus was the Fulfillment of
[29:45] the word one but because when he went
[29:47] contrary to what they believed then Paul
[29:49] we gotta get rid of this we gotta get
[29:51] rid of it
[29:54] but Paul didn't have to pick up a stone
[29:56] and throw it but you know what if his
[29:58] words
[29:59] if he was the one that stirred those men
[30:01] to go do that
[30:03] you know what he was just as guilty as
[30:06] if he had taken the stones and stoned
[30:07] Stephen itself
[30:09] but if he stood there holding the coats
[30:11] while they done it
[30:13] well I didn't get my hands dirty
[30:16] but you know what he was more guilty
[30:17] than they were
[30:21] but he was the one that went up there
[30:22] the thing all worked up about destroying
[30:25] that
[30:26] he had zeal
[30:29] he had a he had a real love for the word
[30:35] and you know what nobody could say what
[30:37] what gods could say in Saul
[30:41] nobody could see what he could see
[30:44] God saw I can use that man
[30:47] that man's got the qualities the
[30:50] characteristics the qualifications that
[30:52] I'm looking for I can use that man right
[30:55] there
[30:55] why because if you can get him the
[30:57] revelation of the word then you know
[30:59] what he had the same Zeal didn't change
[31:01] who he was his nature didn't change
[31:04] but you know he still went after the
[31:05] word
[31:09] and he began to go out and then you say
[31:11] all of the church people
[31:14] oh we believe we believe in a miracle
[31:16] work in God we sing Jesus
[31:18] we were here when Jesus walked the
[31:20] shores of Galilee we seen him raise the
[31:22] dead and heal the sick and and know the
[31:25] thoughts and intents of people's heart
[31:27] and all the things that he had done all
[31:28] the great things that he had done
[31:31] we believe in we believe in a miracle
[31:32] work in God the problem was people
[31:35] didn't believe that Saul could be the
[31:37] miracle
[31:39] Saul wasn't a miracle that they were
[31:41] looking for
[31:47] no Lord we don't want that man
[31:49] that man is crazy
[31:53] he's a he's a troublemaker as long as as
[31:56] long as as long as the day is
[31:58] he's a troublemaker we don't need that
[32:02] but this but the Holy Spirit Come and
[32:04] told her ananias
[32:08] ananias I got a job for you
[32:11] it's like Cheryl Lord are you sure you
[32:13] want me to do this
[32:16] is there not other people in the city
[32:17] that we can go to
[32:19] Lord you know what kind of person this
[32:21] man is
[32:23] he ain't got no good reputation
[32:27] but the Holy Spirit began to deal with
[32:29] ananias you go down there and find Saul
[32:33] and you pray for him
[32:37] see many times we get we get in our own
[32:40] mind how things ought to be or not be
[32:42] and then we we want to we want to judge
[32:44] who people are or who's going to make it
[32:46] who's not going to make it well thank
[32:47] god it's not up to us
[32:51] it's not up to us it's up to God who he
[32:53] chooses
[32:54] he's got a sovereign will and he's going
[32:56] to do how it however he wants to do it
[32:59] and the thing is is we've got to just
[33:01] yield to his will and his way and say
[33:03] Lord however it would be Lord let your
[33:05] will be done
[33:09] and here's here's Saul having having
[33:11] this great Zeal for the for the word and
[33:14] all of a sudden when when the Holy
[33:15] Spirit begins to deal with him and he
[33:17] goes through this and and ananias prays
[33:20] for him and then he gets baptized and
[33:23] the Holy Spirit becomes into him
[33:26] he receives the Holy Ghost well then you
[33:28] know what the first thing he does is he
[33:30] don't run around and jump and shout and
[33:32] all these kind of things well you know
[33:33] what I received the Holy Ghost I receive
[33:35] the Holy Ghost
[33:37] you know what Paul done
[33:40] it's pretty amazing sometimes because
[33:42] when you look at people it's sometimes
[33:44] it's the last thing people want to do
[33:47] but what do you do Paul goes out there
[33:50] and he gets he takes the scripture he
[33:52] takes all the Scrolls
[33:55] well if we if we believe like like they
[33:57] say you know they could stick a pin
[33:59] through a scroll in every letter that it
[34:00] would touch they would knew which what
[34:02] letter it was
[34:04] when he had when he had studied all that
[34:06] day and night he knew every word he knew
[34:09] every jot every title he knew everything
[34:11] about that law he had spent his entire
[34:14] life studying that he knew the ladder of
[34:17] it
[34:18] but one day he had to go on the back
[34:20] side of the desert for three years
[34:23] he said and all he done was go scroll
[34:26] back through the Scrolls back through
[34:28] what the prophet said said what David
[34:30] had said all through the Old Testament
[34:33] reading all of those all that writing
[34:37] all those letters all of those
[34:39] prophecies all those Visions everything
[34:41] that was written down he began to read
[34:43] through those things and all of a sudden
[34:44] you know what he saw it completely
[34:46] different all of a sudden he began to
[34:48] see things that he'd never seen before
[34:50] all of a sudden he began to see that
[34:52] Jesus Christ was laid right there in the
[34:55] Old Testament and everything that was
[34:57] written it began to speak of Christ he
[34:59] began to see Christ and he began to see
[35:01] every part of the Old Testament when he
[35:03] began to look at the Tabernacle in the
[35:04] temple all these things every part of
[35:06] they began to speak of Jesus Christ he
[35:09] began to sing and all those things why
[35:11] did why did Paul you know people don't
[35:13] say you know they don't give a lot of
[35:15] people won't give Paul credit for
[35:16] writing Hebrews but when he began to sit
[35:18] down and look at the things Paul was
[35:20] exactly the one that had to write the
[35:22] book of Hebrews why because he was the
[35:24] one that had the understanding of the
[35:25] Old Testament and no wonder what he had
[35:27] after went through all of that writing
[35:29] and all those readings and everything
[35:30] then he began to speak of the things all
[35:33] through the Old Testament showing the
[35:35] Hebrews the Jews that Jesus Christ was
[35:38] the Fulfillment of it
[35:43] see when he began to take those things
[35:45] he began to see who Jesus Christ was
[35:48] Hebrew came real to him to see who he
[35:50] was
[35:51] and then he began to express that
[35:55] he turned his back on all the rest of it
[36:00] why because he found a new way
[36:02] a living way
[36:04] a life-changing way and then he began to
[36:06] walk in that
[36:09] well no doubt when when Paul goes out
[36:11] and he begins to speak to the people and
[36:13] he begins to tell them about what he had
[36:15] done what he had seen in the scripture
[36:17] about the life changing we know some
[36:19] people probably wouldn't open their door
[36:23] people looking down the street
[36:26] amen
[36:30] don't want to be standing on the same
[36:32] street with him
[36:34] but you know what it took a while for
[36:36] people to begin to see the change in
[36:38] Paul
[36:40] is this an actor is this really
[36:41] something going on did he did he have a
[36:44] real change
[36:46] he just trying to get more of us is what
[36:48] he's trying to do
[36:51] trying to be skeptical about it
[36:54] but you know one one time
[36:57] he began to speak to those people no
[36:59] doubt and all of a sudden the presence
[37:00] of the Lord's there
[37:02] when he begins to speak then all of a
[37:04] sudden realize you know Paul's received
[37:06] what we've received
[37:07] there's been a change
[37:15] so you can't
[37:17] it takes the Holy Ghost to do these
[37:19] things
[37:22] brother Brandon was speaking here in the
[37:23] message Jehovah Jireh
[37:25] and he's and he's speaking of the Bible
[37:28] and he said see it's just like a jigsaw
[37:30] puzzle the Bible's just like he said if
[37:33] you if you excuse the expression he said
[37:36] if you just try to put it together just
[37:37] the way you look at it you've got to
[37:40] have something over here to look at if
[37:42] you don't you'll ruin your scene you'll
[37:44] have a cow peeking grass on top of a
[37:46] tree so it won't work won't be right he
[37:49] said so it's a way when you try to put
[37:51] the Bible together with an intellectual
[37:53] understanding of it you can't do it it's
[37:55] a spirit written word and it takes the
[37:57] Holy Spirit to place it together then
[38:00] when you get the whole great picture
[38:02] from Eden
[38:03] out into chaos and the way of the Cross
[38:07] back home there that's the entire
[38:09] picture God's Redemption story of
[38:11] sending his own son to redeem a loss and
[38:13] polluted people
[38:16] and then continuing on here
[38:20] and this is from the message serpent
[38:21] seat and brother random says he said
[38:24] why did Paul command
[38:27] after it been done Paul said if even if
[38:31] an angel from heaven come and preach
[38:33] anything else let him be accursed
[38:37] so when he had seen all this you can't
[38:39] have it put together by an intellectual
[38:40] understanding because that's what Paul
[38:42] had
[38:43] Paul had the word
[38:45] he had no Olive by intellect he knew it
[38:48] all a Pharisee of the Pharisees
[38:52] and see when Paul begins to speak to the
[38:54] other ones he said you can't lean on
[38:56] your understanding see that's what they
[38:58] had done because even when the when when
[39:01] uh Paul began to rebuke the New
[39:04] Testament Church why because they went
[39:05] into Grace and they want to go back to
[39:07] law
[39:09] they were trying to go why because
[39:10] they're trying to have this balance you
[39:12] need to stay away from that
[39:15] you walk in the grace of God don't go
[39:17] back to the law
[39:19] you've come out of that
[39:21] why because God because Jesus was the
[39:24] Fulfillment of the law that we come into
[39:27] Grace then you know what it's not us
[39:29] trying to fulfill the law by trying to
[39:31] do all the works it's us to live by
[39:34] righteousness by his righteousness in us
[39:36] the light that's in US lives the word
[39:40] hey man
[39:43] he said see if an angel from heaven come
[39:45] and preach anything else let him be a
[39:47] curse now you see we got a new we got
[39:49] new light on it no you haven't
[39:53] that's what the devil come to eat with
[39:56] some new life you don't need no new
[39:58] light you need to walk in the light that
[40:01] God's already put there that's all
[40:05] see we because we don't walk in the
[40:07] latest brother Luke Gibson was preaching
[40:09] the other the other night when he was
[40:10] here you know we got to stand and walk
[40:12] in the light that as the light has
[40:14] shined in front of us we need to walk in
[40:16] that light as he is in the light
[40:18] but see people are trying to find more
[40:19] like let's walk in the light that you've
[40:21] got
[40:23] I can't remember who it was but somebody
[40:25] was here and and they were talking about
[40:27] the uh
[40:28] people overseas somebody and they were
[40:31] talking about oh we're wanting to want
[40:32] more message books we want more message
[40:34] books and and somebody said well said
[40:36] why you want more message books you
[40:38] ain't reading the message books you got
[40:41] well if you not read the word that
[40:43] you've got now why do you even need more
[40:47] we just Stack Up message books like it
[40:50] like it's a status symbol
[40:53] I got a big got a big got my big cabinet
[40:55] here and I got all these well if you're
[40:57] not inside of you're not reading it then
[40:59] what good does it do you
[41:02] cut down all those trees to make all
[41:04] that paper for it to collect dust
[41:08] you know it because many times I've seen
[41:12] preachers that you know some of the
[41:14] brothers come from overseas and you know
[41:16] they only have half a dozen books
[41:18] sometimes they only got a third of the
[41:19] books that we've got in their own
[41:21] language and they know more about this
[41:22] message than other people do people been
[41:25] in there 40 years and you got somebody
[41:26] been here two and a half years and they
[41:28] preach circles around other people why
[41:30] is it
[41:32] why because there's somebody that's
[41:34] laying in the word
[41:35] that's feeding on the word and the word
[41:37] is being quick and to them not just
[41:39] waiting for something just just to have
[41:41] a status symbol
[41:43] who has been sold out to the word and
[41:46] who's just playing games
[41:49] have we sold out how we give our all to
[41:52] this
[41:54] have we given our all have we committed
[41:56] all to God
[41:59] I know I'm in there myself
[42:02] why because I I need I need that too
[42:04] Lord help me
[42:09] you know it's not just throwing it out
[42:10] there
[42:12] hey we're we're responsible for this too
[42:21] see we have to understand that God what
[42:25] God has called us to
[42:29] not just not just to have an idea of
[42:32] something but to know what to know what
[42:34] the truth is to understand the fullness
[42:36] of it
[42:38] you know brother Brandon speaking here
[42:40] and he says you know he says God doesn't
[42:43] send you to hell for being a sinner
[42:46] he said God sends you to hell because
[42:48] you won't repent and take Christ as your
[42:50] savior
[42:53] he said you refuse to take the right
[42:54] Road you send yourself to torment you
[42:57] send your own soul to its Eternal
[42:59] destination upon the free moral agency
[43:01] of your own convictions God does not
[43:04] send anyone to hell he never did and he
[43:06] never will men send themselves to hell
[43:09] because they refuse to accept the way of
[43:11] salvation
[43:13] God he's long-suffering he doesn't want
[43:15] any to perish never wanted it but men
[43:18] rather walk in darkness than walk in
[43:21] light
[43:22] the reason is they're born in that
[43:24] condition and they have no desire to
[43:26] take the light
[43:29] see the messenger he said but God is
[43:32] good and full of mercy and wouldn't want
[43:35] no one lost
[43:37] but man wants to be lost because it's
[43:40] his desire he refuses to walk in life
[43:43] that's what makes him be lost
[43:47] so you've got to walk in the light
[43:51] and so wherever people get stuck at it's
[43:53] not because God's fault is because their
[43:56] own fault
[43:58] because you know as because when when
[44:00] time happens and things happen in life
[44:03] and whatever we've got to get to the
[44:04] place where you know we get to the place
[44:06] where we get down with the business with
[44:07] God we got to get to the place where we
[44:09] figure out where we are with God and let
[44:11] God come and speak to us and if it takes
[44:14] all night if it takes all week if it
[44:16] takes all a month you need to get before
[44:17] God and stay right there until God gives
[44:19] you an answer what God tells you what
[44:22] needs to be done and how it needs to be
[44:24] done and when it needs to be done and if
[44:25] you'll let God work in your life he'll
[44:27] take care of these things but the
[44:29] problem is people still battle the same
[44:31] thing for 30 40 years whatever they keep
[44:33] going around the same mountain in the
[44:35] same problem as as they never get to the
[44:37] place where they get to an answer they
[44:38] never get to a time post that'll hold
[44:40] you there and you'll know where your
[44:42] answer is
[44:44] why because they never get into a place
[44:46] and stay there until they get
[44:47] Deliverance
[44:51] why because how many times has has
[44:52] brother Dale stood up here brother Wade
[44:54] has stood up here and the Holy Spirit be
[44:56] moving through the building and he keeps
[44:58] asking people well if you need something
[45:00] now's your time to come
[45:04] well people don't come
[45:07] well then whose fault is that
[45:11] just like just like brother Brown
[45:12] talking about the man dying on the
[45:14] doctor's doorstep he's standing right
[45:15] there and the doctor's there to help him
[45:17] but you know what he's gonna die on the
[45:18] doorstep because he's a because he gets
[45:20] to the place where he won't go see the
[45:21] doctor he's made it that far he's just
[45:23] going down the steps and won't go in
[45:27] it's the same way we can get to the same
[45:29] boat we get we battle the same things
[45:31] over and over and over and never get
[45:33] Deliverance
[45:38] see we've got to get to the place where
[45:39] we come through and overcome
[45:48] this is from the message the key to the
[45:50] door he says
[45:52] amen you believe
[45:53] under eternal life and Are Born Again by
[45:55] your faith
[45:57] Jesus said in Saint John 5 24 he that
[45:59] believeth my words and believeth on him
[46:01] that sent me has everlasting life not
[46:04] the Holy Ghost just has everlasting life
[46:06] he's born into the family of God and
[46:08] then baptized into the Holy Ghost with
[46:10] the power of the intelligence of Faith
[46:12] to believe the Holy Ghost is put to work
[46:15] and make it act right
[46:18] so you as as brother Dale or brother
[46:21] white was uh preaching on you know
[46:24] having
[46:25] when you when he takes away the Stony
[46:27] heart and he gives you a new spirit he
[46:29] takes out your spirit gives you a new
[46:31] spirit but then he gives you his spirit
[46:34] see there comes a time when he's got to
[46:36] be able to deal with you that he gives
[46:37] you a new spirit he gives you a spirit
[46:40] that he can begin to deal with you
[46:42] that you can live with your own self
[46:46] why because you know what we're so
[46:47] hard-headed and sometimes we're so
[46:49] carnal that God has to beat on to us
[46:51] sometimes to get our attention
[46:54] and it takes the grace of God and as we
[46:57] were speaking of last time about living
[46:58] walking in newness of the spirit why
[47:01] because when the Holy Spirit begins to
[47:03] deal with you because that is the work
[47:04] of the Holy Spirit justification is a
[47:07] work of the Holy Spirit Saint vacation
[47:09] is a work of the Holy Spirit and as you
[47:11] begin to walk along in that Journey see
[47:13] it's the Holy Ghost it's the goodness of
[47:15] God in your life showing that the Holy
[47:16] Ghost is working and you drawing you to
[47:18] that place and it's for us to walk in
[47:20] that newness but because we didn't walk
[47:23] in that before we walked into carnality
[47:25] of our own mind and the desires of the
[47:27] world but when the when the Holy Ghost
[47:29] comes and starts drawing us forward then
[47:32] you know what it takes for us it takes
[47:33] us to continue to walk in that so the
[47:35] Holy Ghost can begin to do the work in
[47:37] us and as he begins to do this work in
[47:39] us then it starts to drive out the
[47:41] unclean Spirit then the Holy Spirit can
[47:43] take up residence in US it takes the
[47:46] word but you know what you've got to
[47:47] continue to go in you've got to continue
[47:49] to go forward in this and if you will
[47:51] continue to walk in it then you'll see
[47:53] the work of God take place
[47:59] yeah
[48:01] he said no man can understand the word
[48:04] outside the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[48:06] and when when man says that he's got the
[48:09] baptism of the Holy Ghost and disputes
[48:11] the word being right there's something
[48:12] wrong
[48:15] see Paul he said Paul was a Critic of
[48:18] the New Testament he wasn't the New
[48:19] Testament wasn't wrote Paul was a
[48:21] Christian was a Critic of Christianity
[48:24] Saul and when he received the Holy Ghost
[48:27] he went three went three years down in
[48:29] Asia and studied the scriptures
[48:35] because he was told unto me a great
[48:37] teacher then when he come back
[48:40] 14 years later
[48:45] he went up to meet Peter and Jerusalem
[48:48] and found out there they were word and
[48:51] by word the same gospel
[48:54] the same God that had that had Peter
[48:57] that had Peter preached on the day of
[48:59] Pentecost and tell them to repent and be
[49:02] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[49:03] that same Holy Spirit revealed it to
[49:05] Paul and he told them again
[49:08] in Acts 19 after they had done been
[49:11] baptized One Time by John said you have
[49:13] to be baptized over again in the name of
[49:16] Jesus Christ see
[49:19] and then he says see
[49:21] the Holy Spirit stays right straight
[49:24] with the scriptures
[49:26] it's faith in that that unlocks every
[49:29] mystery amen the Bible said in first
[49:31] John 5 7 these three that bear record in
[49:34] heaven the father of the word which was
[49:36] the which was Christ and the Holy Ghost
[49:38] these three are one and there are three
[49:40] that bear record in earth water blood
[49:43] spirit these three are not one but they
[49:45] agree in one now you can't have the
[49:47] father without having the son you can't
[49:49] have the son without having the Holy
[49:51] Ghost they are one but you can be
[49:53] justified without being Sanctified and
[49:55] you can be Sanctified without having the
[49:57] Holy Ghost sanctification is the blood
[49:59] is by the blood through the blood comes
[50:02] life see and the Holy Ghost is the power
[50:05] of God see
[50:06] the power given to the church
[50:09] so when you begin to see see then you've
[50:12] got to take just like Paul did when he
[50:13] saw those things it took the Holy Ghost
[50:16] and it began to make it manifest and
[50:18] then he began to walk in that and it's
[50:19] the same thing see the holy spirit is
[50:21] going to stay right with the scriptures
[50:25] as brother Bob was speaking of this
[50:28] morning see when the Holy Spirit comes
[50:30] and you begin to walk in the word and
[50:31] you know then it begins to identify the
[50:33] things in your life
[50:36] but it takes every step of the way see
[50:39] we don't discount somebody that's in in
[50:41] the place of justification
[50:43] why because that's the work of the Holy
[50:45] Ghost
[50:47] and you know what I don't discount
[50:48] anybody that's walking in justification
[50:50] why because that's the work of the Holy
[50:52] Ghost and you know we're not supposed to
[50:53] speak against anything against the Holy
[50:55] Ghost
[50:57] see the only person that's ever going to
[50:59] put down the word
[51:01] because if that's the word and that's
[51:02] the word that they're walking in then
[51:03] they're doing exactly what God has for
[51:05] them to do
[51:07] that's where you're at that's your PL
[51:08] that's your position that's your place
[51:11] but you're the only person that's going
[51:13] to put that down is Satan
[51:16] is when you're when you're anointed of
[51:18] Satan
[51:22] see there's not well you know you're not
[51:24] where I'm at
[51:27] well anytime you ever get to the
[51:28] position where we get that kind of
[51:30] spirit we get that kind of attitude then
[51:32] you know I don't want that I don't want
[51:35] to be in your position
[51:38] but see but you know praise God that God
[51:40] has called people and he's called them
[51:42] to that but the problem is there's a
[51:44] further walk that you've got to come to
[51:45] you got to continue to walk wouldn't be
[51:48] an encouragement to people continue to
[51:49] walk he continue to feed
[51:51] don't give up
[51:54] don't stop now
[51:56] when you begin to see these things when
[51:58] you begin to see the the spirit of the
[52:00] Lord working well praise God just
[52:01] continue to walk and if you fall down if
[52:03] you fail you know what even people that
[52:05] have been born again for years you know
[52:07] they still got problems and they still
[52:08] have failures
[52:12] but you know what we don't we don't give
[52:14] up
[52:18] praise God we've got a
[52:21] we got to Advocate with the father
[52:25] he says continuing on here he said see
[52:28] we we you shall receive power acts 1 8
[52:32] after this the Holy Ghost has come upon
[52:34] you you shall receive power
[52:37] he said not you'll be born again you'll
[52:39] receive power after the Holy Ghost is
[52:41] come upon you then you'll be my
[52:43] Witnesses in Jerusalem and Judea and
[52:45] Samaria unto the uttermost parts of the
[52:48] earth so you receive power after you
[52:49] receive the Holy Ghost But first you
[52:52] must receive the Holy Ghost and that is
[52:54] the power of God see to manifest and
[52:57] demonstrate your you
[53:00] as you was a human and learn to walk and
[53:03] talk and do the things as a human does
[53:04] when you're baptized with the way
[53:08] with the Holy Ghost you're given power
[53:10] to act as Sons and Daughters of God no
[53:13] wonder people act and do the way they do
[53:15] today they've never been filled with the
[53:18] Holy Ghost
[53:20] if they would they'd act different they
[53:22] would they claim they have but Jesus
[53:24] said by their fruits you shall know them
[53:26] so how can you do it and you see it's
[53:29] just all scrupled up see come back to
[53:32] the facts
[53:34] see by the fruits you'll know them it
[53:37] doesn't have you know because it's not
[53:39] by your uh
[53:41] testimony
[53:42] it's by the testimony that you live it's
[53:45] by the testimony that we live it's not
[53:47] what somewhat we just say it's because
[53:49] what takes place
[53:54] see many people they just see it as as
[53:56] something that takes place
[54:03] but it's the Holy Ghost
[54:05] Megan so
[54:07] see this is a message from uh modern
[54:09] events made clear by prophecy
[54:11] and he was speaking of Luther and and
[54:15] the the seed coming through
[54:19] he says and so will the
[54:21] so will the church come through
[54:23] justification sanctification baptism of
[54:26] the Holy Ghost restoration of gifts
[54:29] right on into the formed image of Christ
[54:33] is the bridegroom and the church is the
[54:36] bride and the Bride is a part of the
[54:38] bridegroom it'll have to be a word
[54:40] church not a denominational Church it'll
[54:43] be the word church the word that's made
[54:45] known and by the Vindicated word of God
[54:50] so when we say this that you know
[54:54] I put this in there because you know
[54:56] many times I every time that that I'll
[54:59] speak on this I I just want to uh show
[55:03] everybody that you know people nowadays
[55:06] have have tried to say that brother
[55:07] Brandon preached the uh the new birth a
[55:09] different way and you know he tried to
[55:11] change things and he had one way and and
[55:14] I tell him I said well this right here
[55:15] was uh from uh 12 6
[55:18] 1965. this is modern events at the end
[55:21] of his his ministry getting almost to
[55:24] the end of his ministry and he says the
[55:26] church will go through justification
[55:28] save vacation the baptism of the Holy
[55:30] Ghost and he says see Christ is the
[55:32] bridegroom and the church is the bride
[55:34] and she'll have to be a word church so
[55:38] if this is the word then you know what
[55:39] it will be the word all the way through
[55:41] from the beginning to the end it will
[55:44] always be the same so he never when just
[55:46] like when brother random said in the
[55:47] future home he said I've always told
[55:49] these stages of Grace I've always
[55:51] thought this same thing well it never
[55:52] all the way through the scripture it's
[55:54] the same thing and if you think he
[55:56] changed somewhere well I'm sorry that
[55:58] you've got the wrong Revelation you've
[56:00] got off the word because because God set
[56:03] things in order and it never changed he
[56:06] never deviated from that and so you
[56:08] always have to come that same way
[56:11] because if because if the natural birth
[56:13] types of spiritual birth he didn't
[56:15] change the natural birth
[56:18] it all comes the same way you still got
[56:20] to come that same way and it comes by
[56:22] the word and it comes all the way
[56:24] through and it's not some denominational
[56:26] idea not some other way but it's by the
[56:29] word it's going to come the same way it
[56:31] never changes and so I I wanted to put
[56:34] that in there because I want to show
[56:35] that because because it's it's got to be
[56:37] by the word but brother bad of all says
[56:39] says but it's by the Vindicated word
[56:42] let me tell you something president
[56:44] my word's not Vindicated other people
[56:47] but you know what brother branham's word
[56:48] is Vindicated because it come from God
[56:51] that's the reason I want to stand with
[56:52] the word
[56:57] I want to say because I'm standing with
[56:59] saying well he said
[57:02] because I know what I know what the
[57:04] prophet said I know what the scripture
[57:05] says and I'm standing in the in the
[57:07] Vindication of that why because I've had
[57:10] that same experience I'm walking in that
[57:12] myself I understand what he's talking
[57:14] about
[57:16] see that's what I'm standing in and it's
[57:18] not that I'm trying to change anything I
[57:21] want to know what he said
[57:24] brother Brandon told us that we're
[57:26] supposed to believe what he said
[57:29] why because he was the one he didn't
[57:31] have his own ideas
[57:33] he had he had the ideas the word came
[57:36] from the Holy Spirit from the Lord to
[57:38] give him the word to speak and when he
[57:40] spoke those things that God was the one
[57:42] that responsible for that not him
[57:45] so I'm not I'm not standing here having
[57:47] to be responsible for it
[57:50] I just tell you what he said
[57:53] and I'm responsible for believing it
[57:56] and I'm I'm responsible for acting on it
[57:59] and I'm responsible for walking in it
[58:03] that's my responsibility
[58:11] this is from the
[58:14] we know this
[58:16] we've read this many times but this is
[58:18] from birth pains he says you know we
[58:20] know the old seed it must before the new
[58:22] seed can come out of the old seed it
[58:25] must rot absolutely
[58:27] not die only but rot after it's dead
[58:31] we know that to be true
[58:33] say when that seed rots away that all of
[58:37] that's got to be gone
[58:39] you put the seed in the ground and it
[58:41] rots away you can dig out through the
[58:43] ground and trying to find it you won't
[58:44] find it
[58:45] it's gone
[58:48] because you know way down in the ground
[58:49] you know you can dig through all the
[58:51] dirt and you'll not find anything
[58:53] but you know what that life is still
[58:55] there
[58:56] that seed's still there
[59:00] you see all that has to be all the old
[59:02] man has to be going same thing in the
[59:04] new birth
[59:05] we never go back but we we go forward
[59:08] when you're born again he said that's
[59:11] why I think today we have so many not so
[59:13] many rather genuine New Birth is because
[59:16] the seed is maybe we'll sympathize with
[59:18] the word or the person but they don't
[59:21] want to rot away from the old system
[59:23] that were they were in
[59:27] they want to hold on to something
[59:29] they don't want to come out of it they
[59:31] want to stay in the old system and claim
[59:34] the new birth or the message of the hour
[59:36] a message of the h
[59:37] he said we find that under the Luther
[59:39] Wesley Pentecostals and all the other
[59:41] ages they still try to hold on to the
[59:44] old system and claim this but the old
[59:46] system age must die rot in order to
[59:49] bring forth the new one they still want
[59:51] to clink
[59:53] you know brother I'm speaking of you
[59:55] know he said if the lutherans had a
[59:57] fallen just just stayed in the same
[59:58] light if they'd just continue to walk in
[1:00:00] the light that was there and if they
[1:00:02] would have continued on then they would
[1:00:03] have become Wesley and say to come right
[1:00:05] into the method and say to continue with
[1:00:06] John Wesley's message why because it
[1:00:08] would have brought him right into that
[1:00:10] and he said if the Methodist had a
[1:00:12] continued on in the same word following
[1:00:14] in the same way because the light began
[1:00:15] to grow the light began to move it was
[1:00:17] more like and it was more like to walk
[1:00:19] in if they had continued on they'd walk
[1:00:21] right in and they'd talk about the
[1:00:22] Nazarene and the pilgrim Holiness and
[1:00:24] all the rest of them he said you cabbage
[1:00:26] down he said if you continued on he said
[1:00:27] you'd come right into the Pentecost he
[1:00:29] said you'd have walked into the light
[1:00:30] and you'd have walked right into the
[1:00:32] gifts
[1:00:33] but they failed to walk they began to
[1:00:35] they failed it because they were right
[1:00:37] where they were I know this I know but
[1:00:39] it's continued time to continue on
[1:00:41] and that's what he said the Pentecostals
[1:00:43] invaded continue to walk in the light
[1:00:46] because what was he there he was there
[1:00:48] to minister Delight to them to show them
[1:00:50] the white if they were to continue on
[1:00:52] they'd come right into this message to
[1:00:54] see the the end time to seeing what God
[1:00:57] was doing in this end time
[1:01:00] and it's the same white brothers and
[1:01:02] sisters we have to continue on today and
[1:01:05] walk in the same light
[1:01:08] don't stop continue to walk
[1:01:18] and this is from the five definite
[1:01:21] identifications of the true church
[1:01:25] and he was speaking
[1:01:28] he said if you will
[1:01:29] he said turn to Luke 24 49.
[1:01:35] and he says behold I send the promise of
[1:01:37] my father unto you
[1:01:38] but tear ye in the city of Jerusalem to
[1:01:40] you being dude with power from on high
[1:01:43] now he promised of a coming Church a
[1:01:46] coming Kingdom now turn right around to
[1:01:48] acts 1 8 now remember he spoke also in
[1:01:51] Matthew 16 18 up of Upon This Rock he
[1:01:54] would build his church and the gates of
[1:01:56] hell should not Prevail against it we're
[1:01:58] going to get to that in just a few
[1:02:00] minutes as we go on down into the other
[1:02:02] subject acts 1 8 he said but you shall
[1:02:05] receive power after the Holy Ghost has
[1:02:07] come upon you and ye shall be Witnesses
[1:02:09] unto me both in Jerusalem and Judea and
[1:02:11] Samaria and into the utmost parts of the
[1:02:14] world a kingdom a coming Kingdom of
[1:02:18] witnesses witnesses of his resurrection
[1:02:21] Witnesses of his power Witnesses of him
[1:02:24] being alive you're my Witnesses now acts
[1:02:28] 1 8.
[1:02:29] so when he begins to talk about this see
[1:02:31] then when he says that you've received
[1:02:33] this Holy Spirit the new birth you walk
[1:02:36] through all this and he said you shall
[1:02:37] receive power after that the Holy Ghost
[1:02:40] has come upon you when you walk this way
[1:02:42] then you come to he said then when you
[1:02:43] receive this power then you are to be
[1:02:45] Witnesses unto me
[1:02:47] see now then it's not just walking but
[1:02:50] now we're supposed to be witnesses that
[1:02:51] to Proclaim these things
[1:02:54] see we continue to walk in these things
[1:02:56] and understand the things that God has
[1:02:58] for us to be witnesses to the people to
[1:03:01] show all these things
[1:03:03] now one more thing I want to get to and
[1:03:06] this is to understand about Witnesses
[1:03:08] and this is First Corinthians chapter 13
[1:03:11] and verse 9.
[1:03:13] and and Paul's writing it says and he
[1:03:16] says for we know in part and we prophesy
[1:03:18] in part he said but that which is but
[1:03:21] when that which is perfect is come then
[1:03:23] that which is in part shall be done away
[1:03:25] he said when I when I was a child I
[1:03:27] spake as a child I understood as a child
[1:03:29] I thought as a child but when I became a
[1:03:31] man I put away childish things
[1:03:34] he said for now we see through a glass
[1:03:36] Darkly but then face to face for I now
[1:03:40] for I now I know in part but then shall
[1:03:43] I know even as also I am known
[1:03:47] you know when you when you begin to look
[1:03:49] at these things and
[1:03:50] you see these things that take place
[1:03:53] and you understand why certain things
[1:03:55] take place and and happen
[1:03:59] but you know when you're a child is we
[1:04:01] looking back in childhood and you know
[1:04:03] we have experiences and things that
[1:04:04] happen we don't want to always
[1:04:06] understand why things happen the way
[1:04:08] they do but you know it comes with with
[1:04:10] growth and it comes with in time you
[1:04:12] receive Clarity on these things and and
[1:04:14] you know uh I
[1:04:17] I was just thinking about my dad you
[1:04:19] know and you know you grow up and you
[1:04:21] know they always tell you know well when
[1:04:23] you get older you'll understand these
[1:04:25] things well you know sometimes you think
[1:04:26] well I don't think I'll ever understand
[1:04:28] this but you know it takes in time you
[1:04:31] do understand you didn't begin to
[1:04:32] understand these things and you do begin
[1:04:34] to see these things and and Paul's ready
[1:04:35] to say you know we understand as a child
[1:04:37] we thought as a child but he said well
[1:04:39] we become as maturity takes place he
[1:04:42] said then we begin to understand these
[1:04:44] things and there's lots of times in our
[1:04:45] lives we see things that happen and we
[1:04:47] don't understand and one of the things
[1:04:49] when I was reading this article this uh
[1:04:52] what struck me is you know lots of times
[1:04:54] when people look about this about the
[1:04:56] things in the scripture and everything
[1:04:57] you know God didn't always write things
[1:04:59] in the first action reports as if you
[1:05:02] were in the Army and or the military you
[1:05:04] know they always talk about the first
[1:05:05] action reports and that's the first
[1:05:06] reports that come from the battlefields
[1:05:08] when they first come in and something
[1:05:09] happens the first thing that that's the
[1:05:11] first you know what goes to headquarters
[1:05:13] that first action report this is what
[1:05:15] happened well you know there's only you
[1:05:17] know you're so
[1:05:18] um blinded by that you got blinders on
[1:05:21] you're going I see so much because of
[1:05:23] what took place but you know in time
[1:05:25] because you you gather more information
[1:05:27] there's more intelligence more things
[1:05:28] take place then all of a sudden you
[1:05:30] begin to see more things and they
[1:05:31] understand those first action reports
[1:05:33] because they're things that get left out
[1:05:36] and so one of the things that they were
[1:05:38] writing about was why did why did it
[1:05:40] take to the first century for them to
[1:05:41] write the gospels and it's like well you
[1:05:43] know what because maybe because because
[1:05:46] though those people riding back there
[1:05:48] would have seen it they were like first
[1:05:49] action reports and they're waiting but
[1:05:51] all of a sudden as they begin to grow
[1:05:53] and become the maturity then all of a
[1:05:55] sudden when they look back to the life
[1:05:57] of Jesus Christ and they began to write
[1:05:59] the gospels then all of a sudden they
[1:06:00] could see the things that took place and
[1:06:02] they said oh well now we understand
[1:06:03] those things because we're not children
[1:06:05] anymore now as we begin in maturity have
[1:06:08] Clarity of the scripture now we can
[1:06:10] write this to the gospels now we
[1:06:11] understand these things we understand
[1:06:13] what Jesus was speaking of and we're now
[1:06:15] and then all of a sudden when it begins
[1:06:17] to write all these things there's like
[1:06:18] well they're just writing all the
[1:06:20] gospels as Hocus Pocus no because God
[1:06:22] knows what he's doing because he knows
[1:06:25] exactly when he wanted to write them and
[1:06:26] who what he wrote to write these things
[1:06:29] to understand to see the clarity and so
[1:06:32] many times in our lives we have things
[1:06:34] that happen and we don't understand why
[1:06:35] things happen the way they do but you
[1:06:37] know when it in time God begins to show
[1:06:39] us Clarity and show us these things why
[1:06:41] because we're no more children to be
[1:06:43] tossed about to and fro but all of a
[1:06:45] sudden in time we begin to receive
[1:06:47] Clarity of the word and because as he
[1:06:50] begins to manifest himself in us as we
[1:06:52] begin to grow we've become up the statue
[1:06:54] of a perfect man it's more of him and us
[1:06:56] and we begin to see more we begin to
[1:06:58] understand these things why because I
[1:07:00] thank God the things that I went through
[1:07:02] as a child because you know what I
[1:07:03] didn't understand them and I didn't
[1:07:04] appreciate them then but I tell you what
[1:07:06] I appreciate them a whole lot more this
[1:07:08] morning after being reaching 49 years
[1:07:11] old that I appreciate a lot of things I
[1:07:13] went through I didn't appreciate then
[1:07:16] and why because it takes age
[1:07:19] it takes experiences it takes trials and
[1:07:22] hardships and all these things and then
[1:07:23] all of a sudden when these things take
[1:07:25] place you say thank God for what I've
[1:07:26] come through then you look back over
[1:07:28] your life and you see all the things
[1:07:30] that you've been through and you can see
[1:07:31] the goodness of God in your life you can
[1:07:33] see these things why because God has
[1:07:35] done all this in my life
[1:07:37] and I can see the goodness of God
[1:07:43] I just want to share one more thing how
[1:07:46] the musicians come before we close this
[1:07:48] morning
[1:07:50] but you know I I was thinking about
[1:07:52] brother Branham
[1:07:54] and brother Brown's talking about that
[1:07:56] young lady that had come and she was
[1:08:01] her family been in and out of the church
[1:08:03] and her mom and them and that married
[1:08:05] lady let's all stand this morning and
[1:08:08] the lady she was married she had two
[1:08:09] children and she was dying
[1:08:11] she was she had had a pregnancy that had
[1:08:13] had went bad and they were going to have
[1:08:15] to take the baby and you know they they
[1:08:17] were there and
[1:08:19] y'all know the story is as she was going
[1:08:22] through all of that and they called for
[1:08:24] brother Brandon to come to the hospital
[1:08:25] and pray with them and you know at that
[1:08:28] time she would be going up there and
[1:08:30] they were telling about all this stuff
[1:08:32] that was happening and brother Branham
[1:08:34] Master said are you right with God
[1:08:36] and she said no brother Bill I'm not
[1:08:40] and brother Branham gets down there and
[1:08:42] they pray with her
[1:08:44] and you know they you know because
[1:08:46] brother Ram told her said listen do you
[1:08:47] realize that you're dying said yes I
[1:08:49] understand because of the pregnancy they
[1:08:51] weren't able to do anything she was
[1:08:52] dying
[1:08:54] hey brother Brian prayed for
[1:08:56] and she gave her heart to the Lord and
[1:08:57] then her husband you know hey come back
[1:09:00] to the Lord and her her mother had come
[1:09:02] back to the Lord and you know all those
[1:09:04] things and brother about him seen all
[1:09:05] the goodness of God in their lives and
[1:09:07] all the things that was taking place and
[1:09:09] you know they were laying there and they
[1:09:11] kept giving her medicine everything and
[1:09:12] she got better
[1:09:14] and after she had went through all of
[1:09:16] that she got better they were going to
[1:09:18] do the surgery well praise the Lord
[1:09:19] looks like she's going to survive
[1:09:21] but you know the story is as they she
[1:09:23] was laying there in the hospital and she
[1:09:25] talks to her mother and it was late at
[1:09:27] night and she tells her mom said mother
[1:09:28] I'm leaving
[1:09:31] and brother Brian
[1:09:33] you know he as he describes the story
[1:09:35] and say well you know honey I understand
[1:09:36] you're gonna have the surgery you'll go
[1:09:38] home in a little bit you know after the
[1:09:40] surgery everything will be fine you'll
[1:09:41] go home
[1:09:44] and she told her mom said no mama you
[1:09:45] don't understand
[1:09:47] I'm going to my heavenly home
[1:09:51] and your brother Brandon was so so tore
[1:09:53] up in that situation because you know a
[1:09:55] little bit later she passed away and and
[1:09:57] he was not in town when they had her
[1:09:58] funeral and when he come back to town he
[1:10:00] was talking to Sister Mita and you know
[1:10:02] brother Brandon said I was so upset by
[1:10:04] all of that
[1:10:06] and you know he said I didn't know what
[1:10:07] to do
[1:10:10] and he said I don't know why I done it
[1:10:13] but he stood there and he said
[1:10:16] he told that
[1:10:20] he said I don't know what caused me to
[1:10:22] do it but he said Lord God he said you
[1:10:24] owe me an understanding
[1:10:25] see after me going out there and telling
[1:10:28] that husband and tell them come to the
[1:10:30] Lord after you've done these things for
[1:10:32] him and all that and then they take that
[1:10:34] girl's life like that said you owe me an
[1:10:36] understanding
[1:10:39] when you tell God something like that
[1:10:41] he'll leave you alone
[1:10:44] he said he don't owe me nothing
[1:10:48] I'm in debt to him
[1:10:50] well he just let me pout it out for a
[1:10:52] few days you know
[1:10:54] after about three or four months one day
[1:10:56] I was out there on the creek bank and
[1:10:57] the Lord spoke to me in a vision
[1:10:59] he said now you go tell her mother
[1:11:02] I say this to her mother did not her
[1:11:04] time come the year before that when she
[1:11:06] was drowning in a creek on a picnic
[1:11:10] she should have went at that time
[1:11:12] but I had to take her when she was ready
[1:11:14] to go
[1:11:16] and that's why all this happened
[1:11:19] and while you went out there
[1:11:21] then I got down and cried and said Lord
[1:11:23] Jesus forgive me your poor stupid
[1:11:25] servant
[1:11:26] I should have never said that
[1:11:29] and then he went down there to begin to
[1:11:30] talk to that to the mother
[1:11:33] and how she got tied up in that Creek
[1:11:37] and the goodness of God to her was that
[1:11:40] she waited God had mercy on her
[1:11:44] and when she was ready to go God called
[1:11:45] for
[1:11:49] and brother Brandon was so upset by that
[1:11:52] they said Lord you owe me an explanation
[1:11:56] God doesn't owe us anything
[1:12:01] see we walk by faith and not by sight
[1:12:06] and not and not to charge God foolishly
[1:12:08] because you know what he's got it all in
[1:12:09] control
[1:12:11] we walk as children who as child
[1:12:15] we understood as a child he said but
[1:12:17] when we came a man we put away childish
[1:12:20] things
[1:12:23] we don't know how we're going to get the
[1:12:27] answers or if we ever get answers
[1:12:29] there's lots of things we don't
[1:12:31] understand
[1:12:33] and we may not ever understand them on
[1:12:35] this side
[1:12:36] but I want to say thank God I know
[1:12:39] it's in his control
[1:12:42] and say Lord I want to put my my trust
[1:12:45] and confidence in you
[1:12:48] Lord you lead us and guide us
[1:12:51] give us what we have need of
[1:12:54] I don't I don't want to try to figure
[1:12:56] these things out I want to be in I want
[1:12:58] to be in your perfect will
[1:13:00] and the light
[1:13:01] that you'd have us walk in
