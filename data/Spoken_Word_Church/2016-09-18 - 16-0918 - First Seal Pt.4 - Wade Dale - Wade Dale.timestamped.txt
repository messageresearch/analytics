[0:10] good morning good morning good
[0:12] morning all right here we go we're
[0:14] recording we're ready to go all
[0:16] right now we're in the first
[0:19] seal and we have been this will be
[0:23] number what four yeah number four let's
[0:27] go to Matthew I've got it up here so you
[0:30] know I to open your Bible go to
[0:32] Matthew because we look Martin just come
[0:36] on
[0:37] in there was
[0:39] questions that the um disciples had of
[0:43] Jesus and he went on the Mount of olive
[0:46] this is right before his crucifixion
[0:48] because Matthew 25:26 27 keep going this
[0:51] is when he was crucified all right so
[0:54] he's he's telling they ask him three
[0:56] questions what shall when shall these
[0:58] things be what shall be the sign of thy
[1:01] coming and of the end of the world all
[1:03] right great question so Jesus answered
[1:06] and said unto them take heed that no man
[1:08] deceive you
[1:11] now many of us have read
[1:14] this without Revelation and we we kind
[1:17] of put it off in the
[1:20] future but remember when the seals open
[1:23] the prophet took us straight to Matthew
[1:25] 24 and he started putting the seals in
[1:28] Matthew 24 show knowing that the seals
[1:30] had already been opened or preached by
[1:34] Jesus Christ right okay he knew why he
[1:38] was here he knew what the signs would be
[1:41] and he knew what was his coming
[1:45] back I need to get all of this I don't
[1:48] care about me as long as we get this I
[1:49] want to get the here she was saying I
[1:53] need to move over or something but
[1:54] anyway that's okay many shall come in my
[1:56] name now what's he telling them take
[1:58] heed that no man deceive you now why is
[2:00] Jesus telling the people somebody's
[2:02] going to try to deceive you right from
[2:03] the get-go right from the front very
[2:06] first thing somebody is going to try to
[2:09] deceive you yeah right take heed that no
[2:12] man deceive you for many not
[2:15] one many shall come in my name not in
[2:19] the name of bbub or the name of
[2:23] whoever Buddha Hindu no many shall come
[2:26] in my name saying I am Christ
[2:30] and shall deceive many all right so now
[2:33] we're going to stop right there because
[2:34] that is the first seal you say what's
[2:38] that got to do with the first seal well
[2:40] let's go now
[2:42] to
[2:45] um Revelations 6 we're speaking on the
[2:49] seal Revelation
[2:51] 61 and I saw when the lamb open one of
[2:54] the seals can everybody see
[2:56] that Jo you see that right and and I saw
[3:00] when the lamb opened one of the seals I
[3:01] heard it was a noise of Thunder one of
[3:03] the four Beast saying come and say and I
[3:05] saw and behold a white horse and he that
[3:07] sound him had a bow and a crown was
[3:09] given unto him and he went forth
[3:11] conquering and to conquer now down
[3:13] Through the Ages many commentaries had
[3:15] believed and shown that that since it
[3:17] being a white horse that it had to do
[3:19] had to do something with
[3:21] Christ Purity
[3:23] righteousness um whatever you want to
[3:26] say um but we found out when the seal
[3:29] was open when when the prophet of God
[3:32] went back to Matthew
[3:33] 24 there's you false Christ looking
[3:38] like a white righteous Church you hear
[3:41] what I said looking like and being so
[3:44] close remember it's going to be so close
[3:46] till it almost will deceive the very
[3:50] left
[3:52] right but it won't it will not ever
[3:55] deceive the elect it'll deceive the
[3:57] foolish virgin it'll deceive deceive
[4:00] anyone without the Holy Ghost and it'll
[4:01] deceive some with the Holy
[4:04] Ghost yeah it will don't brother Brandon
[4:09] was deceived and he had the Holy Ghost
[4:10] he was the prophet of God he thought
[4:11] that was white horse rider was the Holy
[4:14] Ghost
[4:15] right that didn't come from his Inside
[4:18] Man that came from that Spirit realm
[4:20] that you and I have got to fight fight
[4:22] fight fight
[4:24] fight remember your soul is just as
[4:26] Eternal as God is it never it never
[4:29] never is false never was false that's
[4:31] what we got to realize and understand
[4:33] what's inside of us is more real than we
[4:36] are
[4:38] yeah right and it never send a day in
[4:41] its life if you're born
[4:42] again if you're born again now if you're
[4:45] not born again it's just as dirty and
[4:47] black as the rest of it but what Satan's
[4:49] done is he's come down through the
[4:51] spirit
[4:52] realm coming on a w
[4:55] horse ReliOn religion now you know
[4:59] listen
[5:00] if you're bothered today by alcohol and
[5:04] drug abuse and and prostitution and
[5:08] pornography if you're if you're if you
[5:10] have a problem with that today you're
[5:12] not born
[5:13] again but Satan's not in
[5:17] that they's not in that that is a
[5:21] product of
[5:22] unbelief Satan is over here in the
[5:25] spiritual
[5:26] realm sitting beside you today look
[5:30] around there's no one beside
[5:33] me I'm okay look around brother R he's
[5:36] okay over there a little bit police is
[5:39] far behind
[5:42] him but really Satan is not see he's
[5:46] just like he he tries to remember he
[5:49] tries to be like God when God bursts you
[5:51] and you're a newborn baby in Christ
[5:53] you're just as Eternal as God is God
[5:55] doesn't worry about your
[5:58] soul right right you're done like I said
[6:01] you're in rapturing condition you're
[6:04] you're you're the real person that that
[6:06] was birthed in you is as Eternal as God
[6:10] is cannot sin you can't hold one not
[6:14] even you can't even say Justified what
[6:16] we say Justified Justified means we did
[6:19] it and then God took it
[6:22] away that Eternal on is inside of you
[6:25] there's no way it ever it ever did
[6:27] it that's what we we got to realize we
[6:30] got to realize that when these seals
[6:32] open it is showing us not that this is
[6:35] just the
[6:38] Antichrist it's got to drive the
[6:40] Antichrist out of
[6:42] you and any any any any word one word
[6:48] off of the word of God is
[6:52] Antichrist you say we can't make it yes
[6:55] if Jesus walked on the face of this
[6:56] Earth for 33 years he was a sinless Son
[7:00] of God and if he's come and dwelt in
[7:02] your
[7:03] soul what are
[7:06] you sure we were born in sin that's the
[7:08] part we got to deal with that's why
[7:10] we're sitting here today that's why we
[7:11] have to go to church you cannot get it
[7:13] by
[7:14] yourself no way right I was looking
[7:17] somewhere the other day and there was a
[7:19] lady made a commentary about something
[7:20] she said well my church is is where I am
[7:23] you know she goes to the woods and prays
[7:25] that's fine that's fine but that's one
[7:28] thing that God put in his word that says
[7:30] forsake not assembling yourself together
[7:34] and much more as a day approaches right
[7:36] so if we're not going to church more now
[7:38] than we ever did then we backslid all
[7:41] right we must we must you say well how
[7:44] do you know
[7:46] well I'm telling you I can tell you from
[7:49] personal experience if I was Sting it
[7:51] home today I'd be
[7:54] backslid right I would I'd be
[7:58] backl cuz I know I need to go to church
[8:00] what is that
[8:02] iniquity iniquity knowing you need to go
[8:05] and you don't go knowing you need to be
[8:09] here listen God knows we're weak human
[8:12] beings in our
[8:14] strongest we're
[8:16] weak right and our you can deny whatever
[8:19] you want to deny they say well I'm full
[8:20] of
[8:23] Christ when you take a body change
[8:25] you'll be full of
[8:26] Christ but before you take a body change
[8:29] you got to deal with that thing you born
[8:31] with called a nature okay sure the old
[8:34] Nature's dead that was inside right amen
[8:36] but all Satan's done is Satan just moved
[8:38] where he could bombard that memory
[8:42] reason conscious affection
[8:45] imagination cuz really your body doesn't
[8:48] sin you know that we we've been through
[8:50] this a million times your body does not
[8:52] sin the flesh I'm looking at does not
[8:58] sin it's a product of sin that's right
[9:01] but it only does what that inside boy
[9:03] tells it to do remember this this hand
[9:06] that used to drink beer and and do
[9:08] things bad that same hand is in on my
[9:11] body but God's cleaned it up he cleaned
[9:13] me up from the inside so I don't do that
[9:15] anymore right things I used to do I do
[9:18] them no more right so you know that
[9:21] something's changed something had to
[9:23] leave
[9:24] you right so like brother Brown said it
[9:27] wasn't just a divorce
[9:31] it had to be a death the old you had to
[9:34] die so that the new creature or Creation
[9:37] in Christ could come forth and and you
[9:40] say well I'm off you're off the 7 no I'm
[9:42] right on the 7 but what what's going to
[9:45] happen I saw Behold a White Horse He s
[9:47] him had a bow now look he had a bow but
[9:49] he had no
[9:50] ARS all right he's a bluff we don't he's
[9:55] bluffing huh we don't notice that no you
[9:57] don't notice that but being a hunter I
[9:59] would know I you know I I could have a
[10:01] $1,000 bow and go set in a deer stand
[10:04] and you know what without an arrow I
[10:06] might throw it at the deer and kill it
[10:09] but I doubt it but I need some
[10:12] arrows so what's he doing he's going out
[10:15] as a bluff a crown was given unto him we
[10:19] don't give Jesus's Crown King of Kings
[10:22] the Lord of lords back forth foundation
[10:24] of the world we don't he doesn't need a
[10:26] crown he's already crowned sure we're
[10:28] going to uh when you say crown that
[10:30] doesn't mean we're going to just all go
[10:32] start setting crowns on his head no come
[10:34] on you know you his head's only as big
[10:36] as
[10:37] hours I know we get kind of carnal
[10:40] sometimes but but a crown means
[10:43] Authority first thing you see when you
[10:45] see a crown you think man that that guy
[10:47] or girl must have done something to give
[10:50] them some kind of authority so a crown
[10:52] was given unto him and he went forth
[10:55] conquering into conquer all right now
[10:59] let's go back to
[11:02] Matthew
[11:09] 24 take heed that no man deceive you for
[11:12] many shall come in my name saying I am
[11:15] Christ and shall deceive many so what do
[11:17] we see in the first opening of the seal
[11:20] we see a white horse rider riding
[11:23] out with a bow with a crown looks like
[11:28] Christ
[11:31] right doesn't mean he were deceived
[11:33] thought it was Christ right that's what
[11:36] they say in many times now
[11:39] in it's just getting so much in the
[11:41] denominations now to where it truly is
[11:44] they're just lodes you go to a you go to
[11:47] a Baptist or a Methodist or you even
[11:49] talk to them and it's like you know they
[11:50] go to church come as you are come as you
[11:52] are come as you are you
[11:55] know God's not
[11:57] there okay God's not there when the
[12:00] prophet of God I've told you before when
[12:01] the prophet of God said that they are
[12:02] lodges how in the world if we think
[12:04] brother random was the prophet if we
[12:06] know brother random was a prophet and he
[12:07] prophesied many things then you got to
[12:09] take what he said he said they're lodes
[12:12] God's not even there
[12:14] anymore why because what they've done is
[12:17] they've took a
[12:19] name that oh sure they love Jesus Christ
[12:21] and you know a lot of like we were
[12:23] talking the other day a lot of Catholics
[12:24] are are more sincere than we are they go
[12:26] to math every
[12:27] Sunday
[12:29] [Applause]
[12:30] every
[12:33] Sunday and we miss you know when we when
[12:35] we
[12:36] want but they're sincere but like the
[12:39] prophet of God said they're sincerely
[12:42] wrong okay that's the deception many
[12:44] shall come in my name saying I am Christ
[12:47] and shall deceive many now how are you
[12:49] not going to be
[12:51] deceived the there's only one way you
[12:54] can't be deceived because the five
[12:57] foolish virgins are deceived because of
[12:59] one
[13:01] item remember the prophet of God said
[13:03] Christ the lamb and the Holy Ghost is
[13:05] the same person so when you say holy
[13:07] ghost you think of Christ you think the
[13:09] Lamb of God when I see that word Christ
[13:12] to me that's the Holy Ghost amen that's
[13:14] the Holy Ghost all right so because what
[13:16] watch this let's Get on Up through
[13:23] here let's read 24
[13:27] because for there shall arise false
[13:29] Christ and false prophets and shall show
[13:31] great signs and wonders in so much that
[13:33] if it were possible they shall deceive
[13:35] the very elect behold I have told you
[13:37] before wherefore if they they they who's
[13:42] that the Antichrist system they shall
[13:45] say unto you behold he is in the desert
[13:48] go not forth behold he is in the secret
[13:51] chamber believe it
[13:53] not how there's only one way you
[13:56] know it's cuz you got him in here that's
[13:59] right right that inside teacher will
[14:01] tell you no I'm not in the desert you
[14:02] don't have to go out
[14:03] there no I'm not in the secret chamber
[14:06] no that's the only way you're going to
[14:08] know it so when we come to the first
[14:11] seal now what's the first what's the
[14:13] first seal
[14:14] doing showing you who you
[14:19] are you say no it's the
[14:23] Antichrist remember the Antichrist is
[14:26] false it's only a mirror image
[14:29] of who Christ really is right so you got
[14:33] Christ here he's the number one guy you
[14:35] know I was talking about you know last
[14:37] Sunday it it's real hard it's kind of
[14:39] hard for us to believe but you know
[14:41] Satan he he really thinks he can whip
[14:43] the one that created him yeah that's how
[14:45] deceived he is he thinks he can whip the
[14:48] one that actually created him
[14:53] uh it ain't going to happen but he
[14:56] thinks it's going to happen
[15:00] for many shall come in my name saying I
[15:02] am Christ and shall receive many now
[15:04] what we've been talking about the
[15:05] mystery of
[15:07] iniquity what is Iniquity knowing to do
[15:10] better and don't do it or doing
[15:12] something knowing that you shouldn't
[15:13] have done it that's
[15:15] iniquity you say what's sin sin's
[15:18] unbelief okay now if you're born again
[15:21] today you're not an
[15:23] unbeliever but you do have things in
[15:25] your spirit realm we're not even going
[15:27] to include the body the SE the the the
[15:29] five senses of the body is this is
[15:31] nothing but a
[15:33] shell that holds that's what I said
[15:36] about Brother Richard at the funeral and
[15:38] death to me is is is so simple when the
[15:42] body the only thing that's fire in this
[15:44] body is the soul that God give
[15:47] me that's what's fireing this body right
[15:51] the
[15:52] light even though a sinner is is uh
[15:56] maybe condemned he has a being he has a
[15:59] light he has a
[16:00] soul and that Soul goes somewhere right
[16:04] same way with Brother Richard his body
[16:06] quit working when your body quits
[16:08] working your Soul's got to leave cuz it
[16:11] cannot inhabit something cuz this is the
[16:14] case that the thing's in right everybody
[16:17] understand to me it's very simple this
[16:19] is the case that the real way dils in
[16:21] now when something ain't firing right we
[16:23] go to the doctor that's right it's not
[16:25] hurting our soul that's right it's
[16:27] hurting our body right cuz we have what
[16:29] we have receptors nerves nerve endings
[16:31] we have all those things that but now
[16:33] when when uh not to be too graphic but
[16:37] when the soul leaves the body they can
[16:40] cut it and do everything they want to
[16:41] with it right and they don't don't go
[16:44] ouch right all that receptor and all
[16:47] that firing mechanism is
[16:50] gone that's because you are we're all
[16:52] children of light when we're given a
[16:54] soul we're all children of light now the
[16:58] Bible say says is your light become
[17:01] Darkness that's what happens when you
[17:03] you go through life and you you continue
[17:06] to do the things you do and and your
[17:08] soul just keeps getting worse and I mean
[17:11] maybe not worse and worse but it's it's
[17:13] it's a
[17:14] Blackness until God can come in cut that
[17:17] out kill that old nature part of you and
[17:21] let your light shine I said to me that's
[17:23] very simple very simple that your soul
[17:25] is your whole firing mechanism the only
[17:27] reason I can talk is because of the
[17:29] Soul's inside of me not the spirit
[17:32] that's right what the spirit does the
[17:34] spirit enhances the soul
[17:37] right everybody got that cuz you your
[17:40] brain doesn't do your
[17:42] memory your brain's just like that
[17:44] computer right there it's what's put in
[17:46] it
[17:48] right okay C taste SP smelling here is
[17:52] what the body can do okay but it can be
[17:55] deceived you get into the spirit realm
[17:57] memory reasoning conscious affection
[18:00] imagin all that's done in your brain and
[18:03] your brain is nothing more than a
[18:04] receptor just like a computer and what
[18:06] you put in it you know that's what they
[18:08] always say junk in junk out good in good
[18:11] out right so all those years we were
[18:13] Sinners it was junk in junk out we
[18:17] showed Who We Are by our actions but now
[18:20] remember though we have come up to a
[18:25] day to where it's moved closer though
[18:30] see it used to be that oh we know he's a
[18:31] sinner cuz he does and you make a
[18:34] list but a real sinner is the unbeliever
[18:37] right that can be sitting right among
[18:41] [Applause]
[18:42] you right that's right not out there
[18:46] that's right not in the barrooms and not
[18:48] out there that to me that they've done
[18:51] uh seared their conscience so much to
[18:52] where you know God can deal with them
[18:55] for a certain length of time but God's
[18:56] not going Bible said God's not going to
[18:59] always strive with man right right very
[19:02] longsuffering like we were talking about
[19:04] he's the only person that could create
[19:05] Grace and make it work we don't have
[19:08] Grace we have to acquire Grace that's
[19:11] right we weren't born with Grace no no
[19:13] no what you looking for my sister no not
[19:17] no not here they okay yeah yeah okay all
[19:21] right it's sisters are coming today so
[19:23] he was looking for
[19:24] them for many shall come in my name and
[19:26] say I am Christ and shall deceive many
[19:28] there's only one way you will not be
[19:31] deceived and that's have the baptism of
[19:33] the Holy Ghost now let's move up a
[19:34] little bit further the only way you're
[19:36] going to take a body change though is to
[19:39] enhance
[19:40] that by letting your
[19:43] soul I I want to say this override
[19:47] anything that your spirit realm brings
[19:51] in listen you can have the new
[19:54] birth right and commit iniquity that's
[19:58] we do it every day every day we get up
[20:01] we go through life and we go Lord
[20:03] forgive me for that what was that
[20:04] iniquity you knew you shouldn't have
[20:05] done that and you did it anyway right or
[20:08] you
[20:09] knew you knew that you shouldn't do I
[20:12] mean you should do something and you
[20:14] don't do it
[20:16] right right I needed to study one hour
[20:19] more yesterday and I didn't I knew I
[20:21] should have but I
[20:23] didn't I listened to a ball game I'm
[20:26] being honest
[20:28] sorry being
[20:30] honest but you know what that
[20:32] condemnation came to
[20:35] me late in the evening that that's what
[20:38] was happening cuz we and you know what
[20:40] that does that to me that that
[20:41] enhancement is is telling you because a
[20:43] lot of times you know you go through
[20:45] life and you do things you say well
[20:46] that's not so
[20:48] bad it's the little foxes that spoil the
[20:51] vine you know we need to commit to if we
[20:54] studied 1 hour we need to commit to two
[20:56] hours okay a day 10% of your time is the
[21:01] same thing as 10% of your
[21:06] money for many shall come in my name so
[21:10] they're going to be so close all right
[21:12] but now the only way you're going to
[21:13] know that is to have that one inside of
[21:16] you but also you must what we say uh
[21:22] Proverbs we're trying to get get rid of
[21:25] this iniquity right how are we going to
[21:27] get rid of this iniquity for those of
[21:30] y'all that weren't here let you want to
[21:32] get rid of iniquity let me show you the
[21:34] Bible gives you every
[21:36] provision until I can't find where
[21:38] Proverbs is there it
[21:40] is it's Proverbs I think 16 or
[21:46] six I got it WR down here I just got
[21:48] under all this pile of
[21:52] stuff 16 5-6
[21:56] right and tomorrow we're going to talk
[21:58] about Ranger Rick
[22:00] today gets that in the mail so to bring
[22:04] it to
[22:05] her
[22:07] 16 you want to get rid of
[22:09] iniquity verse six by Mercy and Truth
[22:12] iniquity is
[22:14] purged there it is right there by Mercy
[22:17] what is Mercy the mercy of God to you is
[22:20] that he in your sin and your condition
[22:23] of sin he came down spoke to you you
[22:26] received what he said
[22:29] and he birthed you into the body he gave
[22:31] you the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's
[22:32] the greatest Mercy anybody because
[22:34] remember if we were born in sin shaping
[22:36] their iniquity espouse from our mother's
[22:38] womb a liar doomed and on our way to
[22:40] hell
[22:41] right there's only one thing can save us
[22:44] and that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[22:46] right Mercy Mercy is the Holy Ghost now
[22:49] what's truth truth of the word you got
[22:52] to put the two together you say that is
[22:54] the same you can have a false Doctrine
[22:57] and have the baptism of the Holy
[23:00] Ghost sure you can Brother Brad did we
[23:04] got to go right back to the example he
[23:07] preached the Holy Ghost was the white
[23:09] horse rider in 1957 and 59 look at
[23:13] Mighty conquerer he reads he leads re he
[23:17] reads Revelation
[23:19] [Applause]
[23:20] 61 did I not read it to you last week
[23:23] where brother R said I have made a
[23:24] horrible mistake the Holy Ghost had to
[23:26] come into the room what was the Holy
[23:28] Ghost doing the Holy Ghost wasn't
[23:29] protecting William brandham the Holy
[23:30] Ghost was protecting the word I've
[23:33] always said you take if you take William
[23:34] bram's
[23:36] life it's a wreck he tried to kill
[23:39] himself twice tried to commit suicide
[23:43] twice tried to kill some children when
[23:47] he was a boy right a that right remember
[23:50] he said I'd have emptied the gun and I'd
[23:51] have killed every one of
[23:53] them but God wasn't protecting William
[23:55] brandom or he'd be a respector person he
[23:57] was protecting the gift that the man had
[23:59] right he was protect he knew that gift
[24:02] had to operate and it had to operate
[24:03] right so he he helped William Brown
[24:06] through his life just like he helps me
[24:08] and you Hey listen that's just a list of
[24:11] stuff he done what about the things we
[24:12] did okay and we're not prophets and
[24:14] we're not you know not even trying to be
[24:18] but God has through mercy and Truth
[24:21] iniquity is
[24:22] purged what is
[24:25] Purge it leaves you it doesn't come
[24:29] back it
[24:31] leaves because from Brother Bram
[24:33] standing there on the first seal he says
[24:35] here stands the lamb and there goes a
[24:36] white horse rider what was it running
[24:38] from it was running from the Revelation
[24:41] that had been brought to the prophet cuz
[24:43] remember Satan hates
[24:45] Revelation he can't stand to be around
[24:49] Revelation
[24:51] truth he can't stand to be around truth
[24:54] that's why he has to move away from that
[24:57] and and what you and I have to do is we
[24:59] have to believe that that's what happens
[25:02] we got to believe that that's what's
[25:03] happen to you and I right
[25:06] amen because they're false Christ listen
[25:10] the Bible says they're going to come
[25:12] right so they're here right they said
[25:15] they're going to deceive
[25:17] many right but they won't deceive the
[25:20] elect the elect is the Born Again
[25:23] baptism of the Holy Ghost in your
[25:25] soul no way that that inside person can
[25:28] sin see that's a paradox you say well
[25:31] uh I like sometimes when some of you
[25:34] look at me a little strange but Martin
[25:36] Luther had the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[25:38] right just like you do right and he
[25:41] taught a trinity smoked the pipe and
[25:43] drank
[25:44] beer that's right so don't tell me you
[25:47] can't have the Holy Ghost and and have
[25:48] some error right in your life sure you
[25:52] can cuz tell me how Martin Luther was a
[25:54] church age messenger a prophet of the
[25:56] age and he could do these things over
[25:58] here and not have the Holy
[26:00] Ghost he had to baptism of the Holy
[26:02] Ghost for his
[26:03] time for his time amen this hadn't been
[26:07] revealed yet but now listen this is
[26:11] proof of it because if Martin Luther was
[26:13] to resurrect today come and sit down
[26:15] right here not just listen to me but
[26:17] listen to any minister with the with the
[26:19] revelation of the hour that we have I'll
[26:22] guarantee you he would repent of what he
[26:26] did I'm not talking about just saying oh
[26:29] I'm sorry no he would be he would be so
[26:32] overwhelmed with
[26:34] repentance knowing that what he done is
[26:37] he took the word of God and he twisted
[26:38] it a little
[26:40] bit had his own idea but that Holy Ghost
[26:43] Inside of him was as
[26:45] pure as God Almighty is that's what we
[26:48] got to understand that if we have Christ
[26:51] in us we don't have to worry about any
[26:53] other fults anything that's right but we
[26:57] have to let him
[26:59] work through our spirit realm that's
[27:03] right I've said before still working on
[27:06] it you do not get a revelation from this
[27:09] Dimension right this Dimension is false
[27:13] this Dimension was not supposed to be
[27:15] here hello this Dimension was not
[27:18] supposed to be
[27:19] here the first three Life Light matter
[27:22] or or or depth and height and whatever
[27:24] it is not supposed to be that's why I
[27:27] like brother hery always said he said
[27:28] this was not so this was not so this was
[27:31] not sure God knew about it but it's not
[27:33] in his it wasn't in his you say well an
[27:35] original plan then it changed no his
[27:39] plan was he wanted people to be on the
[27:41] earth in human bodies living on the
[27:44] earth Eternal
[27:47] right you say how do you know that so
[27:49] that's what we're going
[27:50] to when we fell we fell from that
[27:54] position now we're down here working our
[27:56] way back to that position right all
[28:00] right so the grand the grand finale is
[28:03] what God saw start
[28:05] with cuz remember the the the beginning
[28:08] of God's thought and the ending of God's
[28:12] thought remember end is not like what we
[28:14] say what we
[28:16] think it's just like this it has no it
[28:20] has no time
[28:22] involved his thoughts are Eternal he's
[28:24] had this
[28:26] thought
[28:29] eternally let's just keep going back
[28:32] he's had this thought eternally but
[28:34] what what has happened though this is my
[28:38] thought I have no quote on this but the
[28:40] reason God did what he did what he's
[28:42] doing now is to prove to
[28:45] Satan that there's
[28:47] somebody sure he Mar Eve right he Mar
[28:51] Eve man fell we're in this condition
[28:54] Satan loves it I mean he loves to move
[28:56] around in this in this realm amen cuz
[28:59] it's all it's just all false right amen
[29:02] but when you get a revelation that comes
[29:04] from the mind of God that seventh
[29:07] Dimension where God is he sends it
[29:09] straight down to you and the devil has
[29:11] to back out of the way and let that
[29:13] Revelation come in to me that's why
[29:15] brother R said there's nothing higher
[29:16] than Revelation nothing any higher than
[29:19] getting a revelation from the almighty
[29:20] God nothing amen so our Revelation when
[29:24] he got that Revelation that uh
[29:28] that that was the Antichrist not Jesus
[29:30] Christ don't you think that Prophet was
[29:32] shouting Glory Hallelujah because what
[29:34] he had done is something had been purged
[29:36] out of his life now remember we'll read
[29:38] it next Sunday on the second seal he
[29:40] says he says I don't have a clue what
[29:42] the next seal is what he had done he
[29:45] what he done he took he had took and
[29:47] wrote about it and preached it back in
[29:49] the 50s seven
[29:51] seal and he was looking at his old notes
[29:54] well when he saw this come up
[29:57] and he saw that he was wrong in his
[30:02] thought you hear what I said wrong in
[30:03] his thought that that was the U Holy
[30:07] Ghost he knew the second third fourth
[30:10] fifth six at least had to be something
[30:13] different than what he thought cuz even
[30:15] when you get to the fifth seal people
[30:17] don't read those little things that he
[30:19] talks to the commentaries before they
[30:20] like to get into the meat of the sermon
[30:22] I like to read the commentary cuz what
[30:23] he does he goes back and reviews well on
[30:25] the fifth seal he thought that was Souls
[30:27] under the altar he thought it was all
[30:29] Christian right he thought it was all
[30:31] Christian
[30:33] false false I did that wasn't all
[30:37] Christians that was the fifth seal Jew
[30:39] that had been killed under Ian and
[30:40] Hitler and all down Through the Ages the
[30:42] 68 million that were killed involved
[30:45] Jews and all that that the Catholic
[30:47] Church killed and they were killed and
[30:49] that was a separate group of people than
[30:51] what he thought
[30:53] originally so you see what the seals
[30:55] does what the seals do if you don't go
[30:57] through the seals and it doesn't correct
[30:59] us then it's not open right right then
[31:03] it's not open when it opens up it will
[31:06] correct things that needs to be
[31:08] corrected okay
[31:11] so like you talking about Luther he had
[31:14] the Holy Ghost but he did all those
[31:16] things but not today not today well the
[31:18] word he had word was for the just shall
[31:21] live by faith all right that was the
[31:23] baby form of justification that when you
[31:26] come into the body Body of Christ are
[31:28] when you sorry let me rephrase that when
[31:31] you come to a repentant condition and
[31:33] you are
[31:34] Justified all
[31:36] right now the Bible says that he who is
[31:39] just he who he has
[31:41] Justified we try to justify ourselves
[31:44] that don't work but if God justifies us
[31:46] he's already glorified us but now
[31:47] there's some people that can come to
[31:49] justification that never makes it the
[31:51] sanctification right and they're not
[31:53] saved unless they die under that
[31:56] condition but they're not
[31:58] bright that's what I want you to
[32:00] understand they're not bright you are
[32:01] not the Bride of Jesus Christ until you
[32:03] have the Holy Ghost in your
[32:05] soul doing the things of God letting God
[32:08] that's that fiery
[32:09] mechanism all right they didn't have the
[32:13] word about then to tell them that that
[32:14] was wrong that's why they could
[32:17] drink the word the best example I've
[32:20] ever give and and and if you'll look at
[32:23] it in my view take your hand and do like
[32:25] this this is how to tell whether your um
[32:28] left eye dominant or right eye dominant
[32:30] right you hold it right there all right
[32:32] now look all I'm seeing is
[32:34] Aaron and a little bit of Regina right
[32:38] all you're seeing is what right here
[32:41] that's all you're
[32:42] seeing but now does that negate that
[32:46] there's 20 something people sitting in
[32:48] this
[32:49] room right you can't deny that there's
[32:52] other people sitting in the room but all
[32:54] you all I can see is there when my hands
[32:56] are up here like this that's the same
[32:58] way with the word of God that much was
[33:00] revealed to Martin Luther that did not
[33:03] do away with all this truth and Purity
[33:05] that's out here that's right but now
[33:07] what about the next step John
[33:10] Wesley okay now I can see joce Danny
[33:13] Aaron Regina part of Christine and some
[33:17] of brother Joe little fat Li up over
[33:20] there but now hold on a minute does that
[33:23] make this any different no Aaron's in
[33:25] the picture right but does that mean
[33:28] you're gone no you're still sitting but
[33:30] you see what so God opened the full word
[33:35] now so that this is part of it but it's
[33:38] not all of it but it was all of it when
[33:41] God showed that to Martin Luther the
[33:45] just shall live by faith that was his
[33:47] Revelation for the day and that's all
[33:50] God wanted it the
[33:51] time you got to understand one thing we
[33:54] question things that if if God God did
[33:58] it the perfect way and we got to accept
[34:00] that God did it the perfect way cuz we
[34:02] go well I wonder
[34:04] why it's not for you to wonder that's
[34:07] right I'm telling you that God wrote
[34:09] that Bible so that every born again
[34:12] Christian can get born again can go
[34:15] through the statute of a perfect man and
[34:16] take a body change he wrote it right
[34:18] here brother K and you know what there
[34:22] it's not our idea to change it we can't
[34:25] change that and you know what that's the
[34:27] only way he knew you could get it was
[34:31] the way he wrote it so we must accept
[34:33] that that's why you know everybody say
[34:35] well we need to change this change that
[34:36] no don't change the word of
[34:39] God it didn't change the word of God
[34:41] when brother Brown preached the white
[34:42] horse rider was the Holy Ghost
[34:45] no he was like
[34:49] this Paul had scales on his eyes right
[34:53] until God opens his
[34:55] eyes
[34:57] cuz a lot of
[34:59] times that word
[35:01] see what good does it do to see
[35:04] something what good does it do to
[35:06] physically see
[35:08] something see means to understand I if
[35:11] you don't put you need to put that in
[35:12] there cuz I want to see you upstairs I
[35:16] want listen the only way you're going to
[35:18] physically see Jesus is to see
[35:20] him by understanding of Revelation in
[35:23] the word first you'll never see Jesus
[35:25] Christ unless you see him in the word
[35:27] first right that's what these seals do
[35:29] they bring Jesus Christ right out of the
[35:31] scripture they bring him more clear they
[35:34] tell you who the Antichrist is right now
[35:38] this mystery of iniquity see as we are
[35:41] speaking you should be it should be
[35:43] something boiling over saying hey I need
[35:46] to get rid of this I need to you know
[35:48] quit this I need and it's not just
[35:50] quitting you should be done you should
[35:52] be finished with all that other stuff
[35:55] cuts and smoking running around you know
[35:56] that that went out at the new birth it
[35:58] better have or you didn't get the new
[36:00] birth all right
[36:04] now White Horse He that s on him had a
[36:07] bow and the crown was given unto him now
[36:08] next Sunday we are going to read quotes
[36:10] in the book right but I want to read a
[36:12] few that's on my
[36:14] tablet just for a
[36:17] second she so
[36:19] pretty that's my
[36:23] grandbaby we going to read a few right
[36:25] here Butz I want you to see this
[36:32] it'll blank out but it'll come
[36:35] back all right right
[36:43] here I like this
[36:46] app if you don't have it you need to get
[36:54] it right this is the second seal he's a
[36:58] shrewd fellow when he sees this thing
[37:00] coming coming up then he throws
[37:02] everything he can out there to upset it
[37:05] before it gets
[37:07] there right did you know there will be
[37:10] false Christ arising in the last day it
[37:12] should follow immediately after this
[37:15] after this great message that this
[37:17] brother will speak which was himself
[37:19] that will actually come and be anointed
[37:21] in the spirit of Elijah
[37:23] immediately now one more right here
[37:27] four seal right
[37:29] here watch
[37:32] [Applause]
[37:34] this we've had Elijah's garment we've
[37:37] had Elijah's robe there's been people
[37:38] John Alexander Dow is buried up there
[37:40] wrapped in a robe he said he was Elisha
[37:43] we've had all kind of things like that
[37:44] what is it anyhow it's only to take away
[37:47] a truth that is going to be presented so
[37:50] the truth had to be on the earth
[37:52] remember what I said to have a white
[37:54] horse ride off you got to have a real
[37:56] white right
[37:57] church right because Satan is not an
[38:01] originator of anything he's a copycat he
[38:03] cannot he he cannot create right he's
[38:06] not a Creator he's a perverter right
[38:09] right it
[38:12] only he said it was Ela we had all kind
[38:14] of things like that what is it anyone
[38:15] it's only to take away a truth that is
[38:17] going to be presented see they had false
[38:19] Christ before Jesus this time remember
[38:21] Gia right Gia said hey we had a guy come
[38:24] by and he took 400 people out the desert
[38:25] said he was Christ mhm nothing to it he
[38:29] said but if this man Jesus is Christ you
[38:31] better leave him alone right right they
[38:33] had false Christ before Jesus's time see
[38:36] they always do it it's Satan running out
[38:39] a
[38:40] counterfeit what is a counterfeit you
[38:42] got to have a real dollar first before
[38:45] you can make a counterfeit well they
[38:46] don't do dollar bills they do hundreds
[38:48] you got to have a real
[38:50] hundred $1 that'd be kind of
[38:53] crazy they have a real $100 bill that
[38:55] they have to cop off of to make the
[38:57] counterfeit there's no way you can make
[38:59] a counterfeit if there's not a real Bill
[39:03] there so there's got to be a real Christ
[39:05] a real Lord Jesus Christ before there
[39:07] had to be a Satan that would try to copy
[39:10] him they always do that it's Satan
[39:12] running out of counterfeit to upset the
[39:14] minds and the faith of the people before
[39:17] the thing actually happens that's this
[39:20] age that's this age right here right G
[39:24] said the same
[39:25] thing
[39:27] let's don't read anymore we have stop
[39:28] right there for a second but uh false
[39:31] Christ now I want you to think about
[39:34] something the only way you're going to
[39:36] know that this false is here is for
[39:38] something to be true inside of you
[39:42] right and what was the greatest what is
[39:45] the greatest deception that ever hit the
[39:49] face of the
[39:51] Earth the greatest deception in the
[39:54] religious realm not all that others in
[39:56] in the religious realm what's the
[39:58] greatest thing that got man away from
[40:02] the
[40:08] truth when they took
[40:11] a threers
[40:14] god when they took God and made him God
[40:17] in three
[40:19] persons that was the greatest thing that
[40:23] happened in the religious realm 606 ad
[40:26] right here th Ty right before the five
[40:29] Ty this is what the Dark Ages when they
[40:30] killed 68 million Catholic Church killed
[40:33] 68 million Protestant in 606 ad they
[40:38] come up when they went to n in Rome that
[40:40] Jesus was not the substance of God he
[40:42] was a like substance of God he was
[40:47] created
[40:49] that then it took the father son Holy
[40:51] Ghost baptism all those things that to
[40:54] me that was the greatest so now the
[40:56] first seal then the greatest revelation
[40:58] of the first seal should
[41:00] be that Hear Me O Israel first
[41:04] commandment the Lord thy God is one all
[41:07] right let's
[41:08] go think about that for the
[41:13] [Music]
