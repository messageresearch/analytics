========================================

leviticus i want to make sure you follow me through the message to preach the last sunday there and i want you to you know if you have any questions and answers then we can handle that later or whatever but i want to make sure you understand what i'm saying whether you agree with it or whatever because it ain't up to me to reveal it i can't reveal it but if i can say what the prophet says then you've got to at least believe what he's saying see that's a very important thing because you know you say well well uh we don't believe the prophet said that well if when i read it to you you can't argue that point you know i mean that's that's a settled situation you know you can't argue that but just we'll we'll go back through that and try to cover some things uh brother dick called this morning and said he wasn't able to make it so be much in prayer for him and remember wade will be ministering the lord willing this coming wednesday but then remember he's leaving out thursday to go to the philippines and like i announced the other day if you have anything you'd like to give to him you know feel free to do so if you want to delete lisa and let her handle it every which way whatever but if you have something you'd like to give to him you know we pay the expense of the our trips and the stuff like that but we you know we uh leave the other uh but if you have anything you want to give make sure you do that okay all right um let's see what else two now after this evening service we'll have a little short period there because uh you know sometimes we leave things just kind of open and don't explain a lot of things so we want to go through just a little quick run through of the offices of the church and what's expected out of the officers and things we was going to do it yesterday but we decided to put it over let it be this afternoon and we can take care of that and cover all of the offices and what is the prophet has said about these you know for their doing all right now something else i forgot what it was um maybe i'll think of it a minute it will be for everybody so everybody's included right everybody stay and do it won't take but just a minute it's not just doing but two yeah uh we haven't had anybody to say yet they wasn't going to stay in their position office or whatever it is so then that's good but now if you do you know want to step down or whatever you want to do make sure you let us know where we can announce it this evening and cover things and try to get them covered but we appreciate that okay all right so let's just go into our scripture and i want to approach it little kind of backward way because uh i don't think that we we were doing it last night we had a real good time into bible study last night i thoroughly enjoyed it we were covering a lot of things uh you know that it didn't start that way we had brother ryan with about 10 questions short that we could answer and then we got into uh we started on something and it wound up the whole service we spent on one topic so if you want to listen to it uh feel free to do do so it'll be made for you we had a good time doing it but i'm saying that a lot of times sometimes you know sometimes i do especially i just say things expecting you to understand that but then to realize that uh you know sometimes you do say something and people hasn't read that or they haven't studied that point or line or thought and it leaves the mind kind of uh blank upon saying well well i didn't know it said that but if you just take the message the bible and let the prophet tell you what it is go read that scripture and read those things over and over until you see it and then you can can realize what's taking place so let's go to leviticus 25 because this will be where we'll be getting back to in the message in a minute and let's just read what the bible has to say because we're still on talking about the jubilee what did we find we'll read in a minute what did the prophet say he said i didn't know it until yesterday or today or something he said in 1977 is the jubilee well we're looking at a year it has nothing to do with a year except falling on that date or time he said it's a jubilee well why would we try to figure out how long this is how long that is what find out what it is you know and then we can see that it it will will open up our eyes to the truth all right and the lord speaking to moses in mount sinai saying speaking to the children of israel and say unto them when you come into the land which i give you then shall the land keep a sabbath unto the lord six years shalt thy soul thy field and six years shalt thou prune thy vineyard and gather in the fruit thereof now that's the land right all right but in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the land a sabbath for the lord thou shalt thou shalt neither sow thy field nor prune thy vineyard in other words you've got to leave it lay it out okay but watch what you can do and can't do now that which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest thou shalt not reap now we're going to read about two more verses that you can't eat it but remember the word reap is to reap it to sail or to uh store up or to together is that point all right neither gather the grapes of thy vineyard undressed for it is year of rest un unto the land and the sabbath of the land shall be meat for you for thee and for thy servant and for thy maid in father hard servant and father for thy stranger that so journaleth with thee and for thy cattle and for the beasts that are in thy land shall all the increase thereof be meat all right so you can eat but you don't try to store up all right verse eight now thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee seven times seven years and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years then thy shall cause the trumpet of the jubilee to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month and the day of atonement shall you make the trumpet sound throughout all your land now watch and you shall hallow the 50th year and proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof and it shall be a jubilee unto you and you shall return every man unto his possession and you shall return every man unto his family now it's gone to the person first you're covering the land they were they would take and they would work six years and take a sabbatical as we call it every how you pronounce that big word they would take a year off the land laid out they didn't gather they didn't do but you could go in you could eat what was there you just couldn't take it and reap it and try to sell it or or to store it up and we'll you can go into the bible and say well how are you going to do that or he'll give you see that's why i say i get in the scripture then you've got to cover scripture that you don't intend to cover but in the bible see he gives you in the sixth double for the seventh right he gives you the increase god takes care of those things and makes it to work all right now and you shall hallow the 50th year and proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof it shall be a jubilee unto you and you shall return every man unto his possession and you shall return every man unto his family a jubilee shall that fiftieth year be unto you and you shall not sow need a reap that which growth of it self in it or gather the grapes in it of thine of divine undressed for it is the jubilee it shall be holy unto you you shall eat the increase thereof i don't see what i'm saying you can eat the increase thereof but you don't store it up you don't do it and in the year of this jubilee you shall return every man unto his possession you may be seated the lord had his blessing to the reading of the word now i spent a lot of time there sunday covering some things to try to make a background to where that when you do read the scriptures that you you get your answer out of it all right now then as i tried to cover and i say this then i want to back up all right i tried to cover the point for you to see that it's not to look at dates and times and seasons although they have a meaning to things when world war one ended it was an 11th day 11th hour 11th year et cetera it meant something all right when it come to israel being established as a nation in 46 it meant something it meant something that one did to israel because it was them to come back a nation but also means something to us because 46 was the year may the 6th was the year of establish or the date of the establishment of israel as a nation then the second the next day may the seventh then you have the prophet coming god meeting him sending him to the world with a message to the world all right now watch all that as it ties together in this when you sound the trumpet in in that year and you find a jubilee now as i told you if you look it up and you study it and you go into the bible and you say well i'm going to run in jubilee in my uh a study of the bible well you got to spell it correctly see we spell it j-u-b-i-l-e-e the bible spells it j-u-b-i-l-e you don't have the two e's you just have one but when we spell it we put two e's on it so if you're doing that i'm i do that to where somebody'll come along and say well we can't find the word jubilee the way you spelled it well all right that's the way it's spelled i do that to try to help you to understand all right but now let's approach this this way because we said we read there in leviticus that there was a jubilee and it's 7 times 7 or the 49 was the time all right which is seven sabbaths you had a sabbath for the land and you got a sabbath for the people all right now when it come to that time there were special things took place when you say jubilee to most people they think 50. that's an automatic thought in your mind process is a 50. but you you don't you can't stay in the bible with that you got to get it correctly as to the numbers coming up before you can go to a 50 you got to go to your sevens and seven sabas and get it lined up to where you got your rest correctly you got all of your things there's a jubilee in the bible there was a jubilee every seven years we think jubilees have said it's a 50. you had to go 7 times seven and then you go to your 50. all right and you line up things but you say well what need is to that it's very vital to me because it'll tie together all of the scriptures and if you can't tie together the scriptures see then you don't know what you're talking about that's just plain language all right well i well i just ain't got time to read you've got time to do everything else you know i mean if we're in school today and they assign a topic you're gonna have to answer questions next week you need to read what's assigned so i ask you to do that and then most of the time i just read all of it myself but i know how the mind works i don't know what this means to me well you don't even know what i'm saying i could ask you what did i just read i don't know but see that way you blame me for being too deep what's being deep when you can read like i told a man at work one time he said what are you trying to do i was showing the sabbath was a rest all right in the seventh and how it worked out and sunday was the first day of the week well see to him all he had was sabbath he couldn't understand he said what are you talking about what are you trying to prove i said i'm simply showing by the bible in the calendar that the whole original sabbath was saturday because it's the seventh day in the week sunday's the first day of the week and it says what i'm trying to show you the sabbath and the rest that goes with it well see that didn't mean a thing to him but that's in the old testament they had the sabbath as which is your seventh day of the week right you see we worship in honor we call we don't have no certain day to keep one over the other i'm quoting brother branham we worship on the first day of the week in honor of the resurrection because jesus raised the first day not the seventh day see we're still in those denominational ideas and you'd be surprised what they are a lot of people think jesus was crucified on wednesday raised up early or late saturday sometimes hung around all night long and then appeared to mary magdalene them on the first day of the week well you sure got a mix-up but that's why you don't follow the scriptures it plainly tells you jesus being risen early the first day of the week well then why don't we read it that way and see then that way that's where we miss all right but we're going to get to this in a minute where your prophet said that 1977 is the jubilee well why don't we read that then why don't we believe it like that and that 1977 he said it's the 70th jubilee well you know exactly what jubilee is talking about from the beginning of jubilees in leviticus all right which is really your jubilees begin you go back i try to not to write so much in because it covers my but if you go back to abram abraham abram and you'll find that those things is laid in order to there in genesis 12 i think it is where you go back to the starting with with the time starting with abraham which was abram all right and that's where brother brown come up within 1954 years because he covered it from back there over to here to get his numbers correctly all right but now listen so listen to what i'm trying to say to you follow the point and listen there's a sabbath in the bible every seven years they had a sabbatical you worked six years you rested the seventh all right that was a sabbatical a time that you had a a year off of rest now that's in the bible so let's read those things and see but now remember now i'm going to give you one in a minute if you don't believe it brother branham says in the message feast of the trumpets how your seventh sabbath is for the seven church ages and he's right back before then he's covering how the there's a rest every seven years so we'll get to that in a minute all right just hold on don't say well i don't know where that just hold on we'll get to the minute where the prophet says that there's a rest every seven years all right but let's read the bible on it now but it's like i've told you we read for what we think and i know what brother branham has said i've read it over and over and over and talked trying to understand he talks about arrest he talks about it this way but then he lines it up in the scriptures all right and as he gets it lined up if we'll follow that it'll come out to right where we're at exactly to the understanding so now here we are we're in leviticus and we just read in leviticus so pull it back up now go back up where we was leviticus 25. all right to save reading we drop down to get it to where verse three six years shalt i sow thy field in six years shall i prune your vendored but in the seventh year you shall shall be of what a sabbath of rest unto the land a sabbath for the lord thou shalt not sow you know neither sow nor like into that because it's something happening every seven years seven years is a rest all right god worked six days right and rested the seventh now god in creation worked six days rested the seventh he as a type then jesus when he came in see look where he picked up because he was having to speak of what was coming he said come unto me all you that labor in heavy laden and i'll give you a sabbath i'll give you a rest speaking of the holy ghost that was to come all that old testament laid in order is a perfect type to be able to pull from it in the new testament see then jesus when he come into the new testament so you don't jump over and try to keep a day you get what it is not just a day jesus raised early the first day of the week all right would you go back to the one when you circle you you keep going all right to the number eight okay now but when he was here the holy ghost eternal life was inside of him but he's saying if you come to me and all you labor in heaven i'll give you my rest not just a sabbath of the old testament but a rest but all of that spoke of if you read something on that order you get a whole lot better picture all of those things spoke of the new testament see why would they have a sabbath why would god put it in the scripture like he did here in leviticus that you work six years and rest the seventh why would he put it in the scriptures to work six days and rest the seventh you don't think about well why did he do that he done that to where there would be a type of the new birth to come on over in the new testament to an eternal sabbath all right see you'd come to an understanding of why then that you know jesus raised the first day of the week he didn't raise the sabbath the old rest day he raised the first day of the week which is eternal life it's the eighth day all right so now listen to what we're saying all right so we're reading it and what does it say now pull it back up and let's just go on down go to verse 6 and the sabbath of the land shall be meat to you for thy servant for thy mate and for the hard servant so you can even make you couldn't even make the people that work for you they got a sabbatical too everybody got a sabbatical everybody got a rest everybody would work six days rest to seven and god would always give on the sixth double portion where it will carry through so you can come on over to your past the sabbath you didn't have to get up and do it all right the land it would go through but then you could go out in the land and you could take your stuff and eat it but you didn't try to preserve it or keep it or anything because god gave you the double you're supposed to do that in the sixth make everything ready for the seventh everything run like that you say well did they go through that they went through that every day every day they had to count to days to wind up and see what sabbath then a lot of times they would have double sabbaths ain't going to get into that but a lot of times they was and they'd have two like things happen all right you'd have to cover what's taking place okay but see numbers mean something to god it meant something to the prophet when the bible says when the day of pentecost was fully come then the holy ghost failed right it didn't fall on the third fourth fifth or sixth it even didn't even fall on the seventh it fell on eternity which is christ all right now so watch now verse nine or verse eight because this is where we'll get the point in a little bit thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee seven times seven years and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years okay now you're going to have a a sabbatical a rest every seven years okay now it's got to tie with the rest of the bible and keep it going all right so let's jump over now let's go to exodus you can keep reading in leviticus and read it when you get time but let's go to exodus now these are the judgments which thou shall set before them if thy by an hebrew servant six years shall he serve and the seventh he shall go out free for nothing all right so rest is gonna come every seven years okay we'll read it a little bit where the prophet said he goes out totally free he don't owe nobody nothing but that's where that we don't follow we think we've got something because we got a word or a thought there is no slavery to that but brother branham will call it a slave sold in the market remember a slave sold in the market he didn't go free after six years you see yeah the bible said everything goes well he's a slave the guy that gets bored near sure don't go free right he stays a slave to the master rest of his life but get all of that to a lie and the brother brandon will use the word slave and talk about it being a slave but read your bible and listen to what then he says he said a true born israelite now i'll read that to you in a minute a true born to israelite ain't talking about this to anybody because i told you the children of israel had slaves you you don't follow to line up with the scriptures and then you get all muddled up and well i don't understand what that means brother dale seems to be so happy about this and i don't know what in the world he's saying well why don't you read your bible i thought that's what we're supposed to read but how many of you get your bible down and read when somebody gives you a topic or a thought how many of you go home and read it how many of you listen to the services when you miss well i just don't understand brother dale he's been on that for four weeks now if you'd been here and listen at least you'd know mentally in your mind right it's up to god to do the revealing okay be sorry i'm just sorry to try to say things but then when i try to say it i look at faisal i don't have to understand that i'll give you the pulpit how did brother branham come up with a jubilee of 1977 if he hadn't been studying the bible well god just spoke to him now he said i didn't know this until just the other day so we'll get to it but look now these are the judgments which i shall set before them if thy by an hebrew servant six years shall he serve and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing six years because the seventh is the release the word jubilee is the same word as release listen if you just listen without figuring it all out when i finish this up maybe it'll be next sunday i hope to the lord willing that you can get out of the old testament and get into the new testament and find out that when that jubilee sounds it's the same thing as first thessalonians and it's the same thing as corinthians that says at the last trump for the trumpet shall sound and thessalonians says the lord himself descended with a shout that's the same word as jubilee in the old testament i've preached these for 40 years where have you been that jubilee is the same word as shout out but we we'd like to have things that make us interesting why don't you get interested in the word i ain't got time okay you argue with god about whether you've got time according to brother branham uh john wesley's mother and they had how many kids to have 13 or 16. 13 or 16 kids and she had an hour a day to at least take her with him okay now watch look how beautiful the scripture says it it tells you right to the t what you need to know if thy by a hebrew servant six years he shall serve and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing amen it don't matter what he owes so what is it when you're doing that way i was explaining brother colley i sell i i'll get on debt to brother colley you know all right i go to him and say i can't pay that debt i'll go in bondage to you for six years well now i'm like oh we got a scripture down in here in a minute it's going to slap you in the face with all this but i i don't know whether i wanted to work how long do you think he's got to work six years to pay me so and so on so that ain't got nothing to do with it you don't turn down that man that's asking for money even though he owes you a million and the other guy owes you two dollars you treat him the same cause it's a brother we're going to read it you don't send a man out empty-handed even though he's owes you and come into bondage to you and you work six years you give him enough to be able to get started well what do you mean i ain't getting that's the old jew you're gonna find out one of these days why the 50 never was kept right it never was honored by the jews they didn't even honor the seven but they had to honor some because they say that's god's doing now look look what happens to if he came in by himself i go to brother colley i owe him money i can't pay him i said brother call that work for you six years well you owe too much for me to work six years you're going brothers that ain't a brother i'm trying to get you to see something for once in your life when the bible speaks of a brother it speaks of a brother the bible says that you do this to where there won't be no poor in israel it's got a reason for all the doing you can't turn the man down it ain't a slave to go and sell out it's if i owe my brother i could work for him six years then the seventh i go free now watch what it says if he came in by himself he shall go out by himself if he were married then his wife shall go out with him now this is under a seven so watch what it's saying if he came in by himself he goes out by if we're married his wife go and if his master hath give him a wife and she have borne him sons or daughters the wife and the children shall be her masters and he shall go out by himself do you understand what that's doing if i go in bondage to brother colley six years if i come in with a wife we go out cause that's a brother but if not and he gives me a wife at the end of the six years she don't go free because see now you're going to say well how did you get that well listen because there's no rapture in any church age and this seven sabbath represents i'll read your prophets saying it represents the seven church ages it was limitations in the church ages right every church age wasn't even engaged the same there's limitations there's no rapture the church ages had the new birth yes but other things bound them look what it's saying if his master gave him a wife and she more sons and daughters he goes out and his wife don't if the servant shall plainly say see we want to lay on to that most of the time don't even read these others and if the servant shall plainly say i love my master my wife and my children i will not go out what do you do take him down boy in the ear is that what it says and his master shall bring him unto the judges and he shall bring him to the door or into the doorpost and his master shall bore his hear through will and all and he shall serve him forever that's the one we deal with we don't think about if you go into bondage with a wife well i don't know what that would mean follow the thought follow the thought of the church ages every one of those ages is in the ground i don't care how much they had of the word they're in the ground waiting on us to get them out of the ground well because that's a hebrew buying hebrew okay there's exodus saying it if a hebrew buys a hebrew okay go ahead to deuteronomy 15. due to running 15. at the end of every seven years thou shalt make a release and this is the manner of the release every creditor that lendeth ought unto his neighbor shall release it he shall not exact it of his neighbor or his brother in other words he can't keep it and just throw the guy out you know comes up to the ends i said to brother colley and i go to him and i said well i'm fir tomorrow's my last day brother oh you know and i'm going to be leaving well get out no he's going to say what do you need what do you need to help you get started and he's going to give it to me that's a brother to a brother that was old testament see every creditor that lendeth all unto his neighbor shall release it he shall not exact it of his neighbor or of his brother because it's called the lord's release it ain't me paying brother colley it's god paying brother cawley because he rewards him for what he does for me right or foreigners i must exact it again see how specific to scripture in other words if you've got your own slave he don't have to go free you are a foreigner you don't have to be released because you're dealing with a hebrew to a hebrew or a brother to a brother that's type salvation or a foreigner and a mass thou must exact it again because you tell him hey you pay me but with that which is done with thy brother thy hand shall release if it's a brother you've got to release it now watch save now look how specific the scripture is then we're going to read one down here it says it'll never be that they'll that is you know they'll never be that the poor's the poor is going to be with us always but look save in other words it might be a case come up when there shall be no poor among you if there's no poor among you you don't have to do a lot of the things right that's god's doing now watch what he says for the lord shall greatly bless thee in the land which thy lord the which the lord thy god giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it what happened to who was it back in the old testament jacob and his wives he worked for laban right he's supposed to go free spoofs let him help that wife he tricked him give him another one but then he turns around works seven more goes back to that now i've always said you can argue with me about things but let's put it in scripture spiritually did jacob have to wait 14 years to get rachel he worked six years seven and he done all it was to do for his wife leah her time her doings as a wife he had to stay with her for so long according to the bible really you wouldn't suppose man was supposed to go to war for a year and all that see i don't know what to lend the time that he was but what would be wrong with would take with jacob taking rachel before the 14 years was up this is salvation this is not just dealing with dates and times and farts and thoughts like i just read you i go into bondage to brother collie he's my brother when he gets ready for me to go home i'm not going to be a lazy bum for the six years i work because i'm working for my brother i'm going to do everything i can to help him and god's going to bless did we read it because god will bless god's going to bless and brother callie's going to gain ground from all he's going to do is just say brother take what you need just take what you need whatever you need to get started again take it and let's go because he's my brother salvation is involved in the whole thing what save when there shall be no poor among you for the lord shall greatly bless now look only if thou carefully hearken unto the voice of the lord thy god to observe to do all these commandments which i command thee for the lord thy god blesseth thee as he promised thee and thou shalt lend unto many nations but thy shall not borrow you don't borrow from the nations but you can lend thou shalt reign over many nations but they shall not reign over thee now watch it if there be among you a poor man of one of thy brethren with any of thy gates in thy land which the lord thy god giveth thee thou shalt not harden thine heart nor shut thine hand from thy poor brother now that's a commandment you see why israel is so condemned they never done that they never put their brother first they extracted god open that hand wide unto him then thy shall surely let him lead him sufficient for his needs in that which he wanteth you give him the brother goes home you give him something now watch beware what's israel and how god curses them because they don't keep the 50th come on beware that there be not a thought in thy wicked heart saying the seventh year the year of release is at hand and then i shall be evil against thy poor brother and thy give us him nothing and he crying to the lord against thee and it be sin unto thee are you reading the bible the israel's got the wicked heart they ain't never let nobody go free they ain't going to do it so they're keeping their sin and holding them come on read it if your brother thou shalt surely give him and thy heart shall not be grieved when thou give us unto him well i would give you i would give you provisions for a week but i think you can get by with two days i'm just i'm not going to give you but two days that's a wicked heart you give him whatever he needs and tell him if he needs some more to come back and you'll give him some more that's a brother to a brother i'm talking about salvation whether you believe it or not simply preaching salvation but i'm so deep you can't understand what i'm trying to say salvation was dire look that's what surely give him and thine heart shall not be grieved when thou giveth unto him because that for this thing the lord thy god shall bless thee in all thy works and in all that thou putteth thy hand unto for the poor shall never cease out of the land now he's a toad up there if it's a time that it happens to be that there's no poor you don't have to abide by all of the laws of giving and doing if there's no poor but now he's telling ain't gonna never be that way for the poor she'll never cease out of the land therefore i command thee saying thou shalt open thine hand wide unto thy brother and unto unto thy brother to thy poor and to thy needy in the land and if thy brother and hebrew or a hebrew woman be sold unto thee he shall serve these six ears then in the seventh thou shall let him go free from thee and when thou send us him out free from thee thou shalt not let him go away empty are you following what i just preached thou shalt not thou shalt furnish him liberty out of thy flock and out of thy floor and out of that wine press of that wherewith the lord thy god hath blessed thee thou shalt give unto him why and thou shalt remember that thou was the bondman in the land of egypt and the lord god thy god redeemed thee therefore i command thee this this thing today and it shall be if he say unto thee i will not go away from thee because he loveth thee in thine house because he is well with thee then thou shalt take him in bore him in the ear he becomes his life so the bible keeps laying down in order what you're looking at okay okay let's go to what we got left all right so you see there's a release every seven years and that's what it speaks of back there that they had a rest every seventh year they had a rest every seventh day that was the type that jesus could say come unto me all you that labor in heaven and i'll give you eternal rest all that just typed it so if you don't keep your types right how are you going to do anything else you keep your types in order you'll come out to your antitype the fulfillment because if you don't all right so remember we're talking about salvation well brother dale's salvation to me i come into all and repent of my sins and i asked the lord to forgive me that's what all of that's talking about that's what all that old testament is talking about is a way of salvation jesus when he came took it from honoring the seventh the rest he honored them himself he kept him himself then he spoke of a day to come which would be salvation finished but you know what that old testament under the sevens and the release that i just read that's their jubilee that's their release that's what's all that's what it's all about that's why you got to read all of that and know what it's saying well i don't know where okay go ahead at number six and let's read this let's let the prophet answer the question if you say well i don't know about this seven year release jubilee year paragraph 49. now jesus was prophesied by the isaiah to preach the acceptable year that's what we want to deal with on tonight now the acceptable year was this that enduring the time in other words back there okay come on back there in the old testament in the time because uh between so many years acceptable year is the year called in the old writings the year of jubilee they come i believe it was either every seven years was a jubilee year so now all that i've said you see why that i cut off sunday because i just said you got to release every seven years in the bible how many of you went home to look that up to see if that release was correct or how many of you've ever read exodus deuteronomy and all of these scriptures if you read them real slow you get a beautiful thing what we were doing there last night you take the combat beast the combat beast in the book of revelation the man the ox blind the eagle turned right around and put them in the old testament and then israel camped they count three tribes three tribes three tribes and three tribes how many of you know that it was originally to have been 13 tribes there was 13 tribes in the beginning when israel was in her travel journey there was 13 tribes go to the church age book i'll give you the page number your prophet says it because the levite never had anything he didn't have no land no inheritance or nothing he was sitting in the middle the levite was where the ark of the covenant was at and like wade was talking about it i've used dan but it was judah let's see how do you get 78 can't remember to get all them day but i used to preach on this 30 40 years ago really enjoyed it you realize that they count that away they count three three three and three and there was the priest and the word right in the middle they were guarding that when they got ready to leave judah went out first two more tribes went with him here comes the next one i don't know what the next one was it comes out and in other words six thousand of them they have a yes six thousand and then here goes the word and then there's two more groups following that word that word's protected that levite never had an inheritance but because of dan and ephraim if you read your bible dan and ephraim sinned and when they're dead their name was taken out under heaven didn't say in heaven it says under heaven dan and ephraim is put back in in the millennium because heaven starts ruling over earth again and dan and ephraim is put back in and joseph and minas was taken out and levi put right back in the middle and you got your 13th drive but if you don't read the bible then somebody says i don't know whether that's in the bible or not i ain't never heard nothing like that well i i've i get it out of the bible what i just quoted to you is out of the bible there was no inheritance father levi levi said to god you know where's mine in other words god said i'm your inheritance oh i love brother random when he said look out there seen them great big buildings great big buildings great big things at holly and he said god where's mine he said i'm your portion i'm your portion come on church acceptable year every seven years they let the ground rest they growed no fruit on it or no planted they didn't plant all right they let their crops in the fields rest every seven years at that time was a jubilee a sabbatical a jubilee the priest wrote through the land sounding the trumpet we'll read what the prophet says the priests sounded the trumpet to announce the jubilee because it had to fall if you was listening to leviticus 25 8 when was reading there it tells you the exact date that it has to be done it's on the 10th day of the month of october which is the atonement all the dates has got to be right but we don't read it for that well i don't need to read that you don't even know you don't need to read about the atonement okay go ahead we're still in in the message jubilee here go ahead now the same thing was in the days of the lord when they took a slave and sold it then every seven years there was a jubilee year come by and this was a great time and it has a great significance to the people of today oh that release has a significance or a meaning to you and i today just like it had a meaning for 46 for israel to be established as a nation the next day god sent a prophet to the world with a message that had a meaning that had a meaning when 11 11 falls on the 11th our people right that had a meaning of what 77 is then there were seven years i shall be a jubilee year come by it was a great time and has a great significance to the people of today wrote it on but then every seven years it was the law of god that there was a jubilee year you don't wait to your 50s you got to get your 49s in the old testament then you go to 50s will cover and carry you into the new testament because the old testament will end when jesus was crucified and raised the first day of the week that ended that old testament seven seven seven sevens it wound up to be an 8 which would be no numbers whatsoever so it would go into eternity right look but then every seven years it was the law of god that there was a jubilee year and when this jubilee year come by then the priests rode the land now if we don't get there you just remember this prophet went around the world don't forget that one okay sounding the trumpet the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout trumpet and every slave that had been bought with a price and become a servant was given the privilege to be free go back home again back to his loved ones he was redeemed by back by grace he didn't have to pay anything his loved ones didn't have to pay anything it was an act of god what a beautiful illustration going to the next one number eight are you getting the point the point is the prophet is saying every seven years is a release are you getting that point that's what i mean that's what i'm covering that every seven years was a release then we'll get to the 50. but we've got to go through the sevens all right this is still in a returning jubilee now if somehow or other the individual lost their inheritance that was given to them by god there come a year called the jubilee year and that was ever seven years they had a rest a sabbath every seven days they had a sabbath every seven years they had a sabbath and seventh sabbath was 49 years what 1770 and the 50th year was the jubilee that's exactly right but get your sevens right first and in this jubilee every man that had lost his inheritance by some means if he was a freeborn then it was it was freeborn and a true blooded israelites now that ain't talking about slaves that you buy and try to sail the prophet uses slavery because that's the terminologies of the of our lives yours he's not using slavery what's he using in his jubilee man that had lost his inheritance by some means if he was a freeborn and a true blooded israelite no matter who held the possession it had to go back to him free he didn't have to pay a thing he didn't have to do a thing just stop what he was doing and go back to his inheritance that was every seven years now if that could be so wonderful to be that way what is the jubilee of the fifty what are you listening they had a jubilee every seven years in the old testament right we gave you exodus deuteronomy we gave you the prophet covering this now let's take a step forward let's just move up a step and watch all of these fall into place because all of that's tops and shadows go to the next one which is the feast of the trumpets and seven sabbaths is the seven church years church ages he's blinded waiting all the time on pentecost the first one seven church ages being seven sabbaths so every time they had a church every time they had a sabbath it was a type in the church ages because it's 49 years right 49 7 7's is 49. all right listen what he's saying exactly seven sabbaths from the pentecostal jubilee trumpet a pentecostal jubilee a pentecostal jubilee feast unto the waving of the sheaf and the pentecostal jubilee and then from the jubilee to the atonement of seven sabbaths fifty days and at the end of the fifty days as the atonement is made you get it and this has been a type at the church those seven sabbaths back there when we read in leviticus 25 8 that you'd multiply 7 times 7 would come up with 49 years the 49 years of leviticus and the 49 of deuteron all of them the years are coming naturally would be a type of the seven church ages all right in the seven church ages you had a release every seven years i'm not talking about church ages laying out with a seven year thing you get what i'm saying it wasn't just seven years it was hundreds of years but each church age represented a release because the people were released from satan's bondage in each church age each church age had the baptism of the holy ghost the new birth they had went from the natural rest of the sabbath to the spiritual rest of the baptism of the holy ghost the new birth right all right what'd it turn out to be then brother branham what is 1977 why would you use that we can understand why he used 11-11 right we can understand why use uh uh 46 we'd understand those things but can we understand what is 1977. oh it was a year that the prophet said i read you them over and over and over i got two to just put them on your but i read you like sunday over and over where the prophet said i do not say god told me 77 said if they say that the 77 was to be the coming of the lord he said they're wrong he said i predicted there's not a statement of 77 other than with the predictions or that i can find now other than the predictions and the saying the lord didn't tell me and he said it's not a prophecy come on church in the 60s late 60s and early 70s we set for hours for preachers to preach about a prediction as a thus saith the lord and if we pass 73 and a half we're going to be lost some of you didn't raise up into that but we did that's why i preached in 74 what i did but it didn't shut up nobody because he wasn't even listening they cared nothing about it they had their own predictions like i told you told a dream in like about 70 a little girl about this high and little boy about this high and that little girl was to be our little girl me and nanny and that little boy was to be and in the dream i knew that was to be brother moat's son forrest forest and anna's right about the same age and everybody liked because 70 see by 73 if the baby was born right then it'd only be two or three years old if it's seven it wouldn't have to be ten years old no you're going to miss it you're going to miss it you don't believe the prophet they got tired of listening to service after service about those things all right but you know what we're here now and you know what anna's not here because the lily's sick but you know anna she's quite a little bit more above that now and so is forest but you know they're here and you know we're still here so something must have went wrong we must have not got it figured out if we had it it would have happened if it had been a thus saith the lord it would have happened but it wasn't of thus saith the lord he said the visions god showed him but he said i predict okay listen go ahead to number 10. we'll try to get these which is taken from the 70th week of daniel and here comes around and shows and then i predicted i never said the lord told me that but standing there that morning in the church i said the way progress i got back to one end of the wall and run to the other end of the wall and i said the way god the way prog progress is going on i'll predict at the time i don't know why i'm saying this but i predict that that'll happen all between right now 1933 and 1977. yeah he said i predict that'll take place you know what i believe he believed that because he sure spent a lot of time explaining it didn't he i believe he knew what happened that year i said something happened that's where people don't know listen i don't know why i'm saying it so it's not a number pulled out of the air you know and he he didn't read i don't think he might have read the pyramids of egypt which in one of those the guy says the end of the wall is 1977 and that was put out before brother branham made any or the life's thoughts about it or was somewhere i forgot the exact year but he knew nothing about brother branham it was just a prediction but brother branhams was predictions not thus saith the lord it was predictions well i'll take brother brown's prediction for okay go ahead take the predictions all you want to the only thing i want you to do would you mind reaching over and pinching your hand right how about pinching your hand you know what i mean by that don't you you're still here we're all still here what's the profit wrong but nobody won't tackle 77. because he don't know what it is and i wouldn't either if he hadn't told me but let's read he said i don't know why i'm saying it that was back when he was saying it a few years before then now watch him but i predicted it all happened between right now 1933 and 1977 and not knowing it watch him god knows my heart i never knowed it until yesterday what was he doing he was studying the years that israel was going to house and from their start to where it was and when he did he did he winds up with the number 77 listen and not knowing god knows my heart i never noted until yesterday that 1977 is the jubilee no that's a year you are poured come on church at least wake up come on can't you do one thing you're here how many years past 77 are we here right on 40-something years right but everybody had it figured out it's going to be there what happened why did it not take place you say you're arrogant and hateful there's one thing about it but you ain't gonna misunderstand me i'm gonna make it so plain until you'll at least know what i'm talking about you may not believe it and that ain't nothing to me but it's whether or not god can say it i ain't saying it brother branham said 77. he said it was the jubilee right 77 was the tripoli no 77 was a year oh boy something happened in 1977. i told you last sunday 1977 meant more to me than 11 11 46 with the angel coming well because it had something to do with me that's when the message became alive to me two years later i preached the seven seals that 1974 came out of the series of daniel 70 weeks that i had preached before then because there's where he sent it look i never know to yesterday 1977 is the jubilee now brother dale i want to ask you a question what's 1977 what'd the prophet say he said don't you say that i say it's going to be the end or the lord's coming or the rapture is coming right so it ain't none of them brother branham what is what was 77 he said it was the tripoli there was a release took place there if you want to stay all afternoon we'll preach a little while about how the church ages ended because you're birthed out of the age we won't go that way look 1977 is the jubilee and exactly the same amount of time run out that he gave with israel and everything at the end so we're and here we are at the end of the age at the coming in of the 70th week what is it but brother dale we're not supposed to know the dates of the times and seasons all right go ahead to number 11 based on seven visions along with the rapid change which have swept the world in the last 50 years i predict i do not prophesy that these visions will have all come to piss by 1977. though many may feel that that is an irresponsible statement in view of the fact that jesus said that no man knoweth the day or the hour i still maintain the prediction after 30 years because jesus did not say no man could know the year month or week in which his coming was to be completed so don't throw it to me and say well we ain't supposed to know the day in the hour brother dale he says we can know within a year but one time he said it may be a hundred years i may miss it you remember that one last week he said it may be a hundred years maybe 20 years maybe a hundred years okay but listen people who say brother brown said jesus come in 1977 off the message the 70th week he said i never i never said no such thing jesus may come today but i have predicted that between 33 and 77 something would take place okay now let's go real fast now we're back up to where we started at okay go back to number one let's go for real fast do you jump back in you're doing back to number one the number one is the one where brother branham just said 1977 is the jubilee what jubilee now we're going to read down here what that jubilee is because he said it's the 70th jubilee 1977 was the 70th jubilee since the beginning of jubilees from according to leviticus 25 8 that's what he said so 1977 was the 70th jubilee it wasn't a date or a time or a season it was an opportunity for a release okay come on i predict that between 1933 not knowing it he said it's it's the jubilee right i predict no no going up now let's let's read real fights we've got 10 minutes this is taking starting on paragraph 195 of the 70th week of daniel so he's coming down and he's bringing striking statement from the time god made the promise to abraham that's in genesis 12. i believe that's right don't miss this from the time god made the promise to abraham yeah genesis 12 3 to the time of christ being rejected in a.d 33 by the jews according to galatians 3 16 and 17 and according to ushers usher's chronic chronology of the hebrews the power of god was with the jews exactly 1954 years okay now watch him god dealt with the jews 1954 years according to the chronology of the jews and according to galatians 3 16. all right coming on up now counting the time we find that we have exactly listen 17 years left and we will have the same span of time given to us as god dealing with us in the power of the holy spirit since a.d 33 to 1977 the same span of time 1954 years see people spent time trying to prove right around wrong they've never tackled that because they don't know what he's saying because that's 1944 years that's 1954 years or not come on it's 19 when you come into 1954 you subtract 33 from 77 what will it give you 1944. there's a 10-year discrepancy but remembers how many times the calendars have been changed since you started back there in genesis now mark it down in a little in a book a little scripture here i want to give you now we got the jubilee established 77 is that listen beginning with the eighth verse god calls the jubilee every 49th year the 50th year was the jubilee we know that we understand that from the first jubilee of leviticus 25 8 in 1977 will be the 70th jubilee making exactly 3 430 years jubilee means to going up the release how did we come to that number if you take a jubilee being ever 50 you're going to come to the wrong number because 70 times 50 to be 3 500. is that a mathematical is that since there's a lot of educated in here they can count that far i take my shoes off but he said 1977 be the 70th jubilee since the beginning of jubilees simply multiply 49 times 70. that's 3 430 years he was right through the day 1977 was the 70th jubilee they had had 70 jubilees in 1977 was a sad deal making 3 430 years he knew the years it was now once did you get that god has dealt with us exactly the same amount of time that he dealt with the jews from the time he gave abraham the promise until the rejecting of the messiah in 1833 was 1954 years and now we have 17 years left that's where he's counting from where the messages preach watch 61. we've got 17 years left until 77 will be the 70th jubilee since the beginning of jubilees and what will it be what will 77 be what would you believe be what would the jubilee be what will it be oh brother watch close now don't miss it it'll be the jubilee of the going up of the gentile bride and the return of christ to the jews when they go out of bondage that one's been argued over they can't figure that out because you ain't listening to what he says 1977-70 jubilee 1977 you had had 70 jubilees making 3 430 years what will it be what will 77 be no what will the jubilee be what will the jubilee be it would be a release when the gentile bride's goes in the rapture you say yeah but then it's just a little and that's been a way back there you ain't listening 1977 set a process in motion that your bride can take a change of the body a jubilee a release when we go out of here israel gets this message right you know what they get it under a 49 we get it under a 50 to take the rapture they get it under a 49. so had it taken place in 1977 you give israel a 49 you had 49 on two that will put you one more jubilee 34 30 add 49 on to 1977 and you come out to be 20 16 26 20 26 right 1977 plus 49 would carry to 2020 26 20. all right is that right 2026. make sure we get it right on the tape 2026. all right he said yeah but that's to them what about us 1977 was the 50th to you and me you add 50 you just get one more year i never taught no such thing that the rapture was coming at 77. show me i got the tapes i can prove i didn't don't go to your well i heard you say so and so well you didn't hear me say that because i've never taught any dates or times or seasons i said then it's 1974 we can go past the year 2026 and not break the prophet's message nor the bible i said that in 1974 i still say it today he said well brother dale that's getting us closer hey let me give you another calculations we're in the year 2019 right you add seven more onto that what you got 2026 right what if that seven is israel's ministry we could be leaving out of here today what if that other part is to israel it don't make no difference to me because you see i ain't never tried to prove no dates and i ain't scared of what's going on i've been settled in my mind about dates and times and seasons from all the way back there it can go to 2026 not break the prophet's message now here's one that's going to slap you in the face if that's israel to carry the 49 it'll be 2026. if it's the bride to carry the 50 we can be here to the year 5 000 10 000 100 000. oh you didn't hear them things that i said back there you know why because if you enter the 50 you ain't got no time 1977 we entered a release when this message will be what will take us now give me a second then we'll quit according to leviticus you've got the messenger coming to 7-7 just 49. all right but around this message struck the earth right struck the earth back there because i believe he was the one to ride through the land to tell us we could go free don't you so 1977 would have started an opportunity if we'd just listen to the prophet instead of our own ideas we'd have been out of here a whole lot quicker but we're still here so that means you know what that means everybody that comes in has got to come in that means as wade said the other day if we're looking for the life seed it may be the life seed sitting in this church it may be the last person in india but it may be the last person that got saved five years ago because growth development is involved in the stature of a perfect man so you see but brother dale you're just so you're so agnostics and hateful if i can save your soul i don't care how mad you get at me i don't care now listen to me if it'll save your soul i don't care if every one of you get up and leave this building right now my wife and kids included grandkids if it'll save your soul but i've never been interested in one time this message is the message of salvation 7 7 49 brother branham come not as the messenger to the seventh church age the holy ghost came himself in the fullness of the baptism then at the end of 77 or at the end of time of the mess the prophet come on the scene with his message 77 was where god started revealing it to the real bride it made me happy because there are about four or three years before then i'd already preached we could pass it wantons to no i was looking forward to it let's stand no music we just have anybody got a need because it's 12 o'clock you got a question on it the one question musician that's all right you got a question on it save your time of a question 1977 was the 70th jubilee that's what your prophet said he said it was the going up of the gentile bride and the return of christ to the jews you realize what he's saying we go up on the message that's the release israel gets a release after we get out of here so it's the same message it's just never who is too love him i you have a need coming let's pray be calm her [Music] [Music] did you say you wondered we've tried to make it as plain as we could it's left up to you you honor your word that says by your stripes we are healed we thank you in jesus name amen for anybody else before we go [Music] okay sing it to one another's we're leaving pray one for another remember the service this afternoon and wait and remember after the service stay for a little while and we'll finish up what we've got to do father we thank you for this day and your grace and we love you and we just commit everything into your hands now in jesus name amen you're dismissed oh he first loved me and perk just my oh
