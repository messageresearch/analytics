[8:10] hearts we ask it all in Jesus name
[8:15] amen Ephesians
[8:19] 1 we've read this along we can read it
[8:22] do it by heart I guess K but still
[8:25] blessed be the God and father of our
[8:27] Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed BL us
[8:29] with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly
[8:32] places in Christ that's right according
[8:34] as he had chosen Us in him before the
[8:37] foundation of the world that we should
[8:39] be holy and Without Blame before him in
[8:41] love having predestinated us unto the
[8:44] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[8:46] himself according to the good pleasure
[8:48] of his will to the praise of the glory
[8:51] of his grace wherein he hath made us
[8:54] accepted in the Beloved now I don't know
[8:58] where we'll get this far on this
[8:59] scripture with it but let's go to John
[9:03] 15
[9:05] 15 John
[9:08] 155 henceforth I call you not
[9:11] servants now what's what he's saying I
[9:14] call you not servants see he always
[9:16] called them servants coming down um the
[9:19] servants like the Abraham etc etc we're
[9:25] called servants now he's fixing to
[9:27] change and going over you know and and
[9:30] call us something else but he says I
[9:32] henceforth call you not servants for the
[9:34] servant knoweth not what his Lord doeth
[9:37] but I've called you friends for all
[9:40] things that I have heard of my father I
[9:42] have made known unto you he have not
[9:45] chosen me but I have chosen you and
[9:48] ordained you that you should go for go
[9:52] should go and bring forth fruit and that
[9:54] your fruit should be should remain that
[9:57] whatsoever you shall ask of the father
[9:59] in my name he may give it you you may be
[10:03] seated the Lord at his Blessing to the
[10:05] reading of the word I know you've
[10:07] already prayed for him but just remember
[10:10] especially brother Dale catch there in
[10:13] the time of having the cancer and the
[10:15] things you know you know the Lord would
[10:18] touch
[10:19] him now I I told you what I was going to
[10:23] do there this past
[10:26] weekend and uh you know I was going to
[10:30] just more or less preach a kind of an
[10:33] overall view of what I was going to be
[10:35] covering and you know we gave a few
[10:37] quotes in but not to just sit down and
[10:41] grind you know and U to uh have an
[10:47] understanding cuz that's what we we need
[10:49] we need understanding uh more than
[10:52] anything in the world even if it's just
[10:54] natural understanding because that way
[10:57] then God can Quicken it unto our Hearts
[10:59] you know and he can reveal it cu the
[11:02] disciples their their understanding was
[11:05] open and then they went from there to
[11:10] the upper room and received the new
[11:12] birth which would give them eternal life
[11:15] but not only that it would bring to
[11:17] their remembrance what he said you know
[11:20] and in other words reveal what he had
[11:22] said unto them cuz that wasn't done when
[11:25] he just opened her understanding but you
[11:27] know uh I I want our understand it open
[11:30] I believe that we have the message as I
[11:32] kept saying we're not looking for
[11:34] another message to come and when I put
[11:37] that in there this past Sunday on it
[11:39] that you know the bride and and Christ
[11:41] would unite to bring the message it's
[11:43] definitely not another message we're
[11:46] talking about right because we have the
[11:49] message see and that's that's where it's
[11:52] at so we are not looking for that but
[11:54] we're looking for things in the message
[11:56] to be revealed uh you know like we we we
[12:00] had the Bible before the prophet came
[12:03] right right and and we didn't get
[12:05] another Bible right after the prophet
[12:08] came you know we we we uh you know we
[12:13] just get an opening of our understanding
[12:16] but then I want that revealed to where
[12:19] you know that I can uh can walk there in
[12:22] and and thank God for the the prophet
[12:24] being sent to bring the message unto us
[12:27] all right now we read here in Ephesians
[12:30] and that was what our thought is and
[12:32] we'll use it for a while chosen in
[12:35] him really there in the Scripture it
[12:37] says chosen Us in him specifically
[12:40] stating us you know and uh because
[12:44] brother Brown said that the church at
[12:45] Ephesus could stand strong meat and this
[12:48] wasn't written to The Sinner you know
[12:51] for the sinner to understand this was
[12:53] written to those that were in Christ and
[12:56] who were uh walking in the word
[12:59] greater than uh some of the other places
[13:02] in positions because you know that was
[13:05] the uh that was was what was to be done
[13:08] there but now notice now we we we tried
[13:11] to bring out something so I want to keep
[13:13] on that until you see what I'm talking
[13:16] about if you get bored by it just take a
[13:19] couple of nights off and don't come
[13:21] that's you or either come here and sleep
[13:25] just do your way you want to you can you
[13:27] can handle it but I pray to those that
[13:29] sleep that they will go back and listen
[13:30] to the tapes and things you know and try
[13:33] to get an understanding but now I told
[13:36] you when I started that series on the uh
[13:39] predestination and the things and coming
[13:42] down to uh adoption and then going
[13:44] through you know in the uh dealings that
[13:48] I wanted to get back and speak from
[13:50] Ephesians 1 there because that was what
[13:53] the Lord started revealing some things
[13:55] to me and uh you know I want to make
[13:58] sure that you understand what I'm saying
[14:01] about it and then it's up to God to
[14:03] reveal it to you but we read that we
[14:05] were chosen in him
[14:08] right and that the choosing was done
[14:11] before the foundation of the world right
[14:14] all right so it could not be in any form
[14:19] what we do or don't
[14:22] do because the choosing was done before
[14:24] we got here and that's what he said
[14:27] about um you know ES and Jacob said
[14:30] before they were even born right or
[14:33] anything you see he had already you know
[14:36] uh set forth that he loved Jacob and
[14:39] hated Esau all right now we can get into
[14:42] the long lengthy point of it of
[14:45] predestination for knowledge Etc and and
[14:48] I said now don't let this in any way
[14:51] destroy the point of former forn
[14:53] knowledge of God and and you know and
[14:56] and predestinate by his for knowledge
[14:58] but remember as I was trying to say
[15:00] Sunday when you say for
[15:03] knowledge that means knowledge existing
[15:08] before but it it it's not knowledge
[15:12] before something is known it it it it
[15:16] means that it means for knowledge in
[15:19] other words knowledge before that it
[15:21] would take place right all right but it
[15:25] doesn't it doesn't do away with what's
[15:27] going to take place because it's got to
[15:30] take place if it wasn't it wouldn't be
[15:33] for knowledge all right then he
[15:35] predestines according to his for
[15:38] knowledge all right that's all well and
[15:41] good and we're we're still there and
[15:43] we're not losing anything about it
[15:46] because remember I gave you a piece of
[15:48] paper with the lines of you know
[15:50] eternity and time and things on it and
[15:53] and trying to illustrate it a little to
[15:56] bring it down but see we're over here
[16:00] we're over here in a Time belt right all
[16:02] right trying to comprehend an eternal
[16:05] God and that's hard to do because it's
[16:09] it's not according to our mental mind
[16:11] all right but we just have to believe
[16:13] what God
[16:15] says and then he sent us a prophet to
[16:18] tell us what he said was right right you
[16:21] say well we didn't need a prophet to
[16:22] tell it was right we could read it well
[16:24] why did we have trinitarian Doctrine why
[16:27] did we have eternal hells and why why
[16:29] did we have all of these other things
[16:31] why did we have all of that if we didn't
[16:32] need no profit now but see we we we show
[16:36] up our own
[16:38] selves but notice now I kept emphasizing
[16:41] that we were chosen in him right not by
[16:46] him right because if you're chosen by
[16:49] him then you would run it into a
[16:52] respector
[16:54] persons all right now I hope you
[16:57] followed this one point I tried to
[16:59] emphasize as much as possible that you
[17:01] could say but now what is what is for
[17:04] knowledge was is he looked down here and
[17:06] saw we want to be saved so we had it
[17:08] with Forest
[17:11] amen amen I agree with
[17:14] you but you
[17:16] realize that God will not override your
[17:19] freem moral
[17:21] agency so he will not save you if you do
[17:25] not want to be saved right all right so
[17:29] then if we just say well it's all just
[17:31] by for knowledge well then it's for
[17:33] knowledge that you made a
[17:34] choice cuz if you didn't choose
[17:38] him he's choosing of
[17:43] you now he's going to have to override
[17:45] you three more ages see if he makes he
[17:47] take
[17:48] it you see we we we want to lay on it
[17:51] till we think we understand but do we
[17:53] understand I mean is there something
[17:55] like me comes along and Blast away all
[17:57] of our thoughts about it you know well
[17:59] maybe that's what I'm supposed to do you
[18:01] know to make US settle down to think
[18:03] about it you know even error sometimes
[18:06] is good because it'll it'll it'll make
[18:09] you you know there must needs to be
[18:10] heres among you they that are approve
[18:12] may be made manifest the Bible
[18:14] says so then if I'm in error maybe it'll
[18:17] help you but you know I don't believe so
[18:21] I I believe that I see something and I'm
[18:23] trying to break it down into human
[18:25] language and and break down the barriers
[18:28] that we've had about our language our
[18:31] our brains being sealed off and and set
[18:34] like I heard a man say one time he said
[18:36] our thoughts are crystalized on this
[18:39] well now you know what crystalized break
[18:41] shoes are yeah you throw them
[18:45] away I mean you can sand them all you
[18:47] want to CU we had you T to do that I
[18:49] know you know when we was young we had
[18:51] to take them and they get Christian Life
[18:53] a little and we we buff them and they
[18:55] work for a little while right but they
[18:57] still was no good they come right back
[18:59] you know but see if you're christianized
[19:02] on something that means you're not going
[19:04] to listen right amen you say well I know
[19:08] about how the choosing was and I know
[19:11] how the predestination is and I'm just
[19:13] not going well you you won't get
[19:15] anything because I'm going to say it and
[19:18] I know it hurts feelings like this
[19:21] but 99% of that that people who would
[19:25] think that way was people that says I
[19:27] believe in a trinity and no way you're
[19:29] going to convince me no other
[19:31] way well now you might out argue them
[19:33] and get them into the message but what
[19:34] do you got you got trinitarians in the
[19:36] message cuz they're
[19:39] here amen and that's I get some tickled
[19:41] about say like the River Jordan people
[19:43] and and they they say y'all ain't
[19:45] nothing but a bunch of
[19:48] Oneness well if you got Jesus wasn't God
[19:51] to the River Jordan you had Tess see and
[19:53] you're saying we're Oneness well I don't
[19:55] to be Oneness that's closer to the truth
[19:57] than Tess you know but anyhow I I'm not
[20:01] upset with nothing I've got to the point
[20:03] that I just see that people are not
[20:04] going to understand unless God reveals
[20:06] it and we'll get back to that scripture
[20:09] where that Jesus said you know that no
[20:11] man can come unto me unless the father
[20:13] draws him we'll get to that eventually
[20:15] and bring it out but I was trying to
[20:17] dwell upon the basis of chosen in
[20:21] him and like I said if he looked down
[20:24] through
[20:26] time and he saw you make a choice with
[20:28] you did all
[20:31] right see now he saw you make a choice
[20:35] well then where's your chosen in him
[20:37] right that would be chosen by
[20:41] him see if he sits back here and he he
[20:44] looks through time and he sees you
[20:46] making the choice he sees you wanting to
[20:49] be
[20:50] saved all right then he he's dealing
[20:54] upon what you
[20:56] want so he's dealing upon your
[21:01] choice you know I said right questions
[21:03] down about it I'd love to talk to you
[21:05] about it but see the Bible said we were
[21:08] chosen in him right amen all right and
[21:12] brother R said now when he was chosen we
[21:14] chosen right I gave you that
[21:18] quote but see then all I was trying to
[21:22] get an expression to you about is and I
[21:24] said don't lose all this thing because
[21:26] God did look down through time that's
[21:29] predestination is to sit back here and
[21:31] be able to be God and look all the way
[21:34] down through and see
[21:35] everything that's perfectly
[21:38] right see and then it all comes into
[21:42] view see if we take a a onesided view
[21:45] and we bring everything and put it all
[21:47] up into here and and leave it up there
[21:49] that we don't have a choice because look
[21:51] at Paul he just didn't have a choice he
[21:53] got knocked down was made take it now I
[21:55] don't agree with that right I don't
[21:57] believe it
[22:01] I'm just you know but see then if we go
[22:04] to the other side of it well it was all
[22:05] in what we
[22:07] chose
[22:09] see well now you're going both
[22:12] ways see you're going to a basis of
[22:15] losing the the Bible and you can't use
[22:18] the quotes that brother random uses
[22:20] backwards and forth right but if we look
[22:23] at it
[22:24] correctly then look what a marvelous
[22:26] thing it is I wanted that that at the
[22:29] end of the service but I know I took so
[22:30] much time on the other I didn't have
[22:32] time to explain
[22:35] it you
[22:37] know your children are your children
[22:41] right whether good or bad whatever they
[22:43] are they're your children there's no way
[22:45] to deny I mean who who in the world
[22:47] wouldn't want to deny a child of theirs
[22:49] even the worst that it could be that
[22:50] wouldn't want to deny their child you
[22:52] know uh there would be no form of that
[22:55] in my mind uh I wouldn't maybe agree
[22:57] with my children about a lot of things
[22:59] but I there's no way in the world that
[23:01] any of them could ever sin enough to
[23:03] make me if word that I wouldn't have let
[23:05] the world know that I was their father
[23:08] well you mean murder yeah there's just
[23:11] no way well because they're my children
[23:13] they're my
[23:14] Offspring all right and see but the
[23:18] point of it
[23:20] is there's still your children right and
[23:25] you love them but what about when you're
[23:28] this like we are as a family it just
[23:30] wonderful to me now brother uh brother
[23:33] Quinn I think was the one that said it
[23:35] I'm not certain but somebody said one
[23:38] day at the house said Brother D just sit
[23:40] there and looked at you said you were
[23:41] just sitting there looking over cuz we
[23:43] do we get together at the house and
[23:44] we'll just everyone be in the living
[23:46] room and we're just laughing and talking
[23:48] and having a big time and just just
[23:50] going on you know and eating together
[23:52] and fellowshipping and and he said I was
[23:54] looking at you and said you're just
[23:55] looking over your heritage and you was
[23:57] grinning I said yeah
[23:59] cuz I'm very proud of my Heritage of my
[24:02] family right I'm very proud that they
[24:05] have chose to first to serve the Lord
[24:09] that's the number one two they have
[24:11] chosen to try to be good at least human
[24:14] morally you know and they they wanted
[24:17] work for a living they they they want to
[24:19] do and they want to to to help and and
[24:21] do anything and they're good to help
[24:23] other people and you know what that
[24:25] makes me think a lot of them right I'm
[24:28] I'm I'm hoping that um that
[24:31] was part of my point and my life's part
[24:34] of being instilled into them you know as
[24:37] to to the way of going all right and you
[24:40] know that makes me very proud well my
[24:42] point is this that when God looks down
[24:46] if he just made you do
[24:48] something and then you done it because
[24:50] you say well God you made me do it I've
[24:52] done it anyway there's no rewards
[24:56] there right
[24:58] H he's not pleased with that form of a
[25:02] child right but he's pleased with one
[25:05] when they see the word and want to
[25:08] follow the word and want to you know
[25:11] learn the word and and and walk in the
[25:14] word that makes him very proud of his
[25:17] children you know and you say well is he
[25:20] proud well he was so proud with job
[25:24] until he
[25:26] said Satan
[25:30] have you considered my servant
[25:33] joob he's proud of that you know what
[25:36] he's fixing to do turn him loose let the
[25:38] devil get him right right you know what
[25:41] he's very proud of him sure he could
[25:44] look through at the end and see what job
[25:46] was going to do but job couldn't so he
[25:49] had to let job make the choice and let
[25:50] job live the life and and come to it to
[25:53] where he could come to him and contact
[25:55] him but he was very pleased for that
[25:57] right God is pleased to to let us go
[26:00] through trials and troubles and problems
[26:03] and heartaches and to see us come out of
[26:05] it acting
[26:06] correctly and as we always say then if
[26:08] we don't then we just get another test
[26:11] you know we're going to go back through
[26:13] it again in all until we get the whole
[26:15] thing correctly the way God wants it all
[26:19] but see that way I was trying to make
[26:21] the emphases that by you choosing God
[26:25] you say but we didn't choose God God
[26:27] chose us I know the Bible we went
[26:30] through that I know what the prophet is
[26:32] saying but also know that he don't
[26:35] override your free more
[26:38] agency so he gave you a choice and you
[26:41] made the right choice Danny Henry to
[26:43] brother Brown you've made the right
[26:45] choice because of this a great portion
[26:47] of Heaven AWA you Abraham you've made a
[26:49] great choice I'll make you the father of
[26:53] Nations Abraham made a
[26:56] choice he didn't have to leave what was
[26:58] it g what it was there he didn't have he
[27:00] didn't have to leave out of that place
[27:02] he could have stayed right
[27:04] there but see God told him you won't go
[27:06] do that he said I'm going to do
[27:08] it that's my whole part of a Christian
[27:12] Life is we do have something to do with
[27:14] it on this side now salvation no
[27:16] salvation's of the lord we didn't save
[27:19] ourselves for being good that's my whole
[27:22] point I'm trying to get to you he didn't
[27:24] look down through there and see how good
[27:25] we would be and say I'll save dick out
[27:28] because I know he'll be
[27:30] good now he looked down and seen how bad
[27:32] he
[27:33] was but then he looked down there and he
[27:36] saying well all I got to do is cross his
[27:39] path he may not jump all at once and
[27:41] grab everything but I cross his
[27:44] path well he also knew that he could
[27:46] cross everybody else's pth and I told
[27:49] you and I believe it that brother around
[27:51] said
[27:53] everybody has got that longing within
[27:56] them every human being because of a soul
[27:59] that's in that individual you go to the
[28:01] hot and tots of Africa to where they've
[28:03] never seen a or he of Jesus Christ or
[28:05] God or anything like they're worshiping
[28:07] Idols they're worshiping animals they're
[28:10] they're because of a soul that's within
[28:13] that individual that's right that longs
[28:15] after the Creator because they realize
[28:18] they're
[28:20] creation you see then that's the whole
[28:23] thing but
[28:24] now let's get down into
[28:29] see we tried to cover that we were
[28:30] chosen in
[28:33] him all right now I ask you a simple
[28:38] question who's the
[28:40] himy you remember that was a simple
[28:43] question if we were chosen in him who's
[28:45] the
[28:46] himym now we know that we are chosen and
[28:50] and we know that that you know it's only
[28:56] uh to to line up the word
[28:59] correctly that if somebody made a
[29:03] choice see well what do we use the word
[29:07] choice
[29:08] about see we say we were chosen in him
[29:11] okay who's the him
[29:14] right and
[29:16] then who was the one that made the
[29:23] choice for this other seemingly person
[29:26] or whatever to to make a
[29:31] choice it seem like
[29:33] trinitarianism
[29:36] right so then our word choice or
[29:41] choosing is not always the way that we
[29:44] think it
[29:45] is
[29:47] see all right are you with me now if
[29:49] there any problem raise your hand there
[29:51] I'll go back through it and just do the
[29:53] best I can because I want you to
[29:54] understand this
[29:58] we were chosen in him who's the
[30:01] himym see if you're if you're total
[30:05] Oneness you cannot comprehend the
[30:09] Bible right but if you're a trinitarian
[30:12] you can't comprehend the
[30:13] Bible and surely we don't want to go in
[30:16] the middle saying I'm a God in three
[30:17] persons you cuz that's
[30:21] trinitarianism but who's the
[30:26] himym that's a simple question
[30:29] question well questions gender Strife
[30:33] you know you quote scripture can't you
[30:39] yeah the round set of
[30:42] church questions made have strong
[30:46] church
[30:48] right so it evidently is not what we
[30:50] think it is on that
[30:53] basis it's all right to ask
[30:56] questions cuz that's way we
[30:59] learn so who's the
[31:02] himy we know for certain that we were
[31:05] chosen in
[31:07] somebody cuz it says him now what it him
[31:11] is a pronoun but it means a takes the
[31:14] place of a noun so we know that what
[31:17] we're talking about here is chosen in
[31:20] Christ right am now see it's like I said
[31:24] I didn't have enough time Sunday I would
[31:26] just laid a foundation to go across come
[31:28] back now we know we wasn't chosen in
[31:31] Jesus right the flesh right right now we
[31:34] will get to it later that we were in him
[31:38] amen well he was in flesh or we will
[31:40] never be all right now but Jesus the
[31:45] flesh man wasn't back there right so we
[31:49] were chosen in Christ right all
[31:53] right
[31:55] and did God
[31:59] make a decision to send somebody
[32:05] else down
[32:07] to fulfill his plan and purpose or did
[32:12] he come himself that's
[32:17] right so then we talk about the great
[32:20] Elohim the self-existing one who dwelt
[32:26] alone and see then we take the prophet's
[32:29] message because that's the only way we
[32:30] have of doing it we're not theologians
[32:33] who can go back but even the the great
[32:35] things I like to read even scoffield
[32:37] will will have enough to understand that
[32:39] that he would call the the the first
[32:42] part that would come out of God he would
[32:44] call it the L go speech or word our son
[32:47] of
[32:49] God cuz they had that much understanding
[32:52] about the terminologies of words
[32:56] right but
[32:59] see we were chosen in
[33:02] him all right now as I
[33:05] said did God look down in
[33:12] Christ did he choose him to
[33:18] come or was that him that came in
[33:22] another form amen all the great
[33:25] teachings read Around May about it right
[33:30] amen it was not another God right the
[33:34] great Pillar of Fire that went out the
[33:36] logos the theophany the the the speech
[33:39] the
[33:40] word was not another
[33:43] God it was God in another
[33:46] form called a son he said or called
[33:50] Christ all right so now then it's not
[33:53] one choosing another one to do that's
[33:55] why we we use the word choose
[33:58] like meaning that you know I I'll choose
[34:00] brother klie but I I won't choose
[34:02] Brother Anderson see that's choosing
[34:06] that's that's us doing
[34:08] it but what about a God could look down
[34:11] through time and see
[34:13] himself existing in time in both of the
[34:17] individuals at the same time amen that's
[34:20] a whole lot
[34:24] different see chosen
[34:28] not somebody's choosing will I no he
[34:32] chose to to
[34:35] condescend is that the way the prophet
[34:37] brought it right God chose to condescend
[34:40] Down to Earth all the way down through
[34:44] tooking 4,000 years through the Old
[34:46] Testaments descending through the pillar
[34:48] of fire the thing and finally coming
[34:49] into
[34:52] flesh and he chose to do that but that
[34:54] didn't end his choosing
[34:58] because in him could be all the
[35:01] attributes of healer savior all like
[35:04] that but somebody had to be sick
[35:07] somebody had to be
[35:08] lost so then the parts that would take
[35:11] care of the rest of it is not just a
[35:13] foolish virgin a group of people or
[35:15] people up on earth that could grab
[35:17] something and and they do and that's
[35:19] wonderful that they get healings and
[35:24] things
[35:25] see but God ch CH to come this way
[35:32] amen all right and when he look down
[35:35] upon that form of himself cuz that's
[35:38] where people don't I don't mean Brother
[35:41] Gary we get into this pretty heavy
[35:42] sometimes but you see I have no trouble
[35:47] whatsoever with one form of God praying
[35:51] to another form of
[35:55] God form you understand what I said cuz
[35:59] Jesus prayed right he prayed to his
[36:05] father and he was God manifested in
[36:07] flesh you say well he just praying
[36:09] inside of him no he didn't say he
[36:13] was he said his father was in heaven
[36:16] that's right right and he was speaking
[36:18] to him and he prayed mightily to his
[36:21] father even to the basis of saying you
[36:23] know if it possible let this cut pie
[36:25] from me
[36:28] you say well that was just the flesh all
[36:30] right God was in that
[36:35] flesh but see
[36:37] then I don't have any trouble with
[36:40] looking back at God as before the world
[36:43] the great
[36:44] Elohim the great self-existing and
[36:47] realize that there's things about God
[36:49] that we're not going to receive while
[36:51] we're in this world and that's what your
[36:53] Prophet said that's right he said he
[36:55] would give us a message of cheer down to
[36:57] in the sages if it wasn't for these
[37:00] quotes I couldn't preach what I'm
[37:02] preaching right cuz none of us would
[37:05] have any common sense to even talk about
[37:07] it but by saying what he
[37:12] says that we're not we're just getting
[37:15] enough of God here enough understanding
[37:18] and thing to me is when we get there to
[37:21] be able to understand am that's
[37:25] right and you know it's just a a way of
[37:28] looking at
[37:31] something so then he chose to
[37:37] condescend and his first condescending
[37:40] was in theophany our word form to be
[37:43] able to
[37:46] create
[37:48] right now we know and I've been over and
[37:51] over we brother said who this mes we
[37:53] bassed arthop right all right
[37:58] because that was a word body that was
[38:00] standing
[38:02] there not just a myth or a form or
[38:05] whatever it's a word
[38:09] body we didn't come that way as
[38:11] individual
[38:13] people but if we wasn't in him how will
[38:17] we ever have eternal
[38:20] life foolish virgins and people like
[38:22] that can be given eternal life but they
[38:24] there have no part to do with him and
[38:27] it's only by
[38:29] impartation it is not by a new
[38:34] birth a lot of difference in in an
[38:36] impartation of eternal life or be given
[38:40] something then someone to receive it
[38:44] right but you see then if we were chosen
[38:48] in him when he was hearing the word if
[38:50] we wasn't in that word the prophet said
[38:51] we'll never be here that's right
[38:55] amen he said that was all my Mighty God
[38:58] in another form
[39:02] amen now listen to what I'm
[39:08] saying did God look down and see his
[39:13] son do the way he wanted him to do it
[39:17] and
[39:18] said I chose
[39:22] him come on no come on
[39:28] that's what I'm trying to get you to see
[39:30] right he didn't look down and see him
[39:33] and say oh no right he's my son bless
[39:41] him and these others are my sons
[39:45] too so I'll choose him he choose the
[39:48] rest of them oh
[39:51] no that's what I'm saying do we
[39:53] understand one God
[39:57] if that word formed theop whatever you
[40:00] want to call it back Son of God that
[40:02] stood before the world and said let
[40:04] there be if that was not almighty God
[40:07] then where we at that's right amen eat
[40:10] drink
[40:12] B but see if that was almighty
[40:15] God then it was the form he was using
[40:20] right and then when it says in him dwelt
[40:23] the fullness of the godhead
[40:25] bodily we believe that
[40:28] and your Prophet says a bride in the end
[40:31] time she will be the fullness of the
[40:34] godhead bodily you believe those quotes
[40:39] amen but does that do away with
[40:43] God when we say oh God was he poured
[40:46] into Christ does that do away with God
[40:48] no that's what we think we think it's
[40:50] like taking water it's in a GL we poured
[40:53] over another glass there it is then we
[40:56] say all God all Christ in the church we
[40:59] take that and pour it over in another GL
[41:02] we got two empty gles to throw away I
[41:05] don't see it that way I'm
[41:08] sorry I don't see it that way I see
[41:11] every time God open that GL and pour it
[41:13] over into another that it magnifies him
[41:17] that it increases
[41:19] him that it make him greater and
[41:24] greater because he got more
[41:29] offsprings more ability to express
[41:31] himself
[41:35] right I've always told you he could give
[41:37] every person over 7 billion in the world
[41:39] today he could give every person in the
[41:41] world today eternal life would that do
[41:44] away with
[41:46] God no that would
[41:49] multiply
[41:51] right that would multiply God
[41:58] there's something coming up now and I
[41:59] don't understand it so I'm going go
[42:01] ahead and say it as best I can all right
[42:04] I'm just telling you I don't but this is
[42:06] going through my
[42:09] mind we are the body of Christ is that
[42:12] the Bible
[42:15] right H members in
[42:18] particular
[42:20] right one a hand un a foot this you know
[42:24] right because we're the body of Christ
[42:28] all right the same Bible
[42:33] says that we are his
[42:36] wife
[42:39] right that we're the bride of Christ
[42:42] right
[42:49] right the same Bible
[42:53] says that we are God
[42:57] made manifest
[43:03] amen now
[43:06] that's I mean that's how many things can
[43:09] we put in there that the Bible will show
[43:11] us to be right come
[43:13] on
[43:15] right
[43:16] true right but you said we're just the
[43:20] same
[43:22] people we're members of his body right
[43:28] he's the head of the body right
[43:32] right we are his wife his bride
[43:38] right we's children right
[43:47] mhm does that make it
[43:50] confusing if it does we need to pray
[43:52] right her the said something something's
[43:54] going to unfold her and and I wait for
[43:58] that because I realize it amen see
[44:02] because we've got to see all of the
[44:03] things that we are come on but to see
[44:06] that we are exactly what we are is what
[44:09] I was trying to express
[44:11] Sunday amen we're not another God that's
[44:15] right right we're not another person
[44:17] that's
[44:19] right it's either God made manifest in a
[44:22] bride form which is the body of Christ
[44:24] which is the children of God is all in
[44:26] all to be one are we sure have missed a
[44:28] whole plane
[44:31] amen
[44:34] right so then as we read and we study
[44:37] then don't get confused about well
[44:38] that's just say we're about
[44:44] it but see we were chosen in
[44:49] him and when he was in word
[44:54] form who was he
[45:00] almighty God Amen with an Earthly
[45:04] terminology is being used of calling him
[45:07] the
[45:08] word you know human
[45:11] words we can call him Loos theophany
[45:15] Etc as I said then there he was in that
[45:19] theophany word body standing there
[45:23] looking to me just exactly like he
[45:25] looked when he was back there with with
[45:27] with
[45:28] Abraham and when Moses saw the back part
[45:32] and the same one that stood on the
[45:33] shores of Galilee right
[45:36] amen and then brother RAM and the Bible
[45:39] said if we wasn't in him when he walked
[45:41] ashore of Galilee we never will be in
[45:43] him
[45:46] amen see right you see why it's took so
[45:50] many years to preach the the godhead to
[45:53] the place that we can understand right
[45:57] we've needed all these 40 years or more
[46:01] to try to express the the point of
[46:03] trying to get it down to
[46:07] understand see we looked at that like
[46:09] we're chosen him well he chose Jesus and
[46:11] Jesus chose us where in him that's what
[46:13] it is let's go home oh we really Glory
[46:16] Hallelujah we know all about
[46:19] it
[46:21] amen that's as trinitarian as any
[46:23] trinitarian Doctrine could ever be
[46:30] did you
[46:33] choose in any
[46:36] way to be who you are I'm doing natural
[46:40] now now brother Dean did you figure out
[46:42] some way to be able to make it down to
[46:45] what you look like you
[46:47] look I don't think so not meaning he's
[46:50] ugly and won't need something help
[46:51] changeing but you know get you to life a
[46:55] little where you'll think
[47:00] we didn't have anything to do with our
[47:02] natural
[47:06] choosing
[47:10] right we never had anything to do with
[47:13] our spiritual
[47:15] choosing now we're back before the world
[47:18] okay we done been over here on this side
[47:20] and see that we must choose him we must
[47:22] accept him we must do those things
[47:24] that's got to be
[47:25] done but then we'll see that all the
[47:27] time it was him coming after us that's
[47:30] right right that's
[47:32] it did Jesus have a choice of being
[47:39] Jesus or was he almighty
[47:43] God which one is
[47:50] it he was either almighty God or the
[47:52] biggest deceiver of the world ever seen
[47:54] the prophet
[47:55] said and see see that holds together the
[47:57] one
[48:00] God as we talked about the Oneness see
[48:02] they say he's one like a finger are
[48:04] Jesus was the final form of God well I
[48:06] don't agree with that I believe the
[48:07] bride of Christ is the final form of God
[48:09] on this side of the earth you know this
[48:11] side of the time gaps
[48:14] and and even we're going to be so great
[48:16] until even the the foolish virgins will
[48:19] get eternal life and even the fifth
[48:20] still Jews and the things that goes to
[48:22] them they still will not be the Bride of
[48:24] Jesus Christ that's right amen
[48:28] they will still not be his body they
[48:30] will still not be his
[48:32] offspring they will only have eternal
[48:34] life by
[48:35] impartation right and if you and I
[48:39] hadn't to come the way we did they
[48:41] wouldn't be
[48:45] here how would they got
[48:49] here if it had been a fall in the garden
[48:51] and for us to come the way we come how
[48:53] would anybody be here that doesn't have
[48:55] eternal life today how they would they
[48:57] be
[49:00] here right it's not in right God's plan
[49:04] and purpose was to reveal himself to man
[49:09] his own creation all right now was he
[49:12] trying to reveal himself to his
[49:15] creation Now
[49:18] listen or was he trying to reveal
[49:20] himself to his
[49:22] children and we know we are his creation
[49:25] okay
[49:27] you get the point one
[49:29] saying did he just choose to reveal
[49:31] himself to all
[49:34] mankind no he chose to reveal himself to
[49:38] his
[49:39] children and all mankind then could reap
[49:42] the benefits of that being
[49:45] done he didn't come to
[49:48] save all the
[49:52] world he would that they would be saved
[49:55] right mhm
[49:57] but he come to save only those now we're
[49:59] going to get back to a little word and
[50:01] I'm not going to spend much time on it
[50:02] tonight because take a whole
[50:04] message what does redeem mean
[50:11] right it means to go back where you came
[50:14] from that's right
[50:19] Amen brother Rand said only the
[50:21] predestinated is considered in
[50:22] Redemption right only the Seed of
[50:25] Abraham
[50:27] what is the seat of Abraham not not
[50:30] Jews the faith seat of
[50:37] Abraham do you see why it's so much of
[50:39] trying to express and to explain and I
[50:42] do it doesn't matter to me if I spend
[50:43] six months on this one
[50:45] thought as long as we get
[50:48] it and understand what is being said
[50:52] it'll open the entire Bible the
[50:54] prophet's message will open all the
[50:56] things things will open if we just
[50:57] realize who we
[50:59] are and what we're
[51:03] doing and then we can see that yes we
[51:06] was he was here in this world and we as
[51:09] young people or something maybe in Life
[51:11] or S and and and we started crying and
[51:13] praying for God to save
[51:17] us and come find out it was God choosing
[51:21] us God seeking us the goodness of God
[51:25] the scripture said lead is
[51:28] repentance not teaching my wife and I
[51:30] were talking today about this that you
[51:33] know most preachers preach about how bad
[51:35] everything is and they preach on dress
[51:37] and hair and clothes and wrong to be a
[51:40] homosexual and wrong to be a a this and
[51:43] a wrong to be that and you ought not be
[51:45] a Muslim and you ought not be a Hindu
[51:47] and you ought not be a you ought not be
[51:48] none of these you know we need to all be
[51:53] Christians but there former Christianity
[51:55] is believing there
[51:57] word are
[51:59] them why don't you preach the gospel
[52:01] brothers and get the people
[52:04] converted I thought it was preaching the
[52:06] G the gospel I thought Jesus was the
[52:08] Gospel I mean I I didn't know it was our
[52:11] dos and DS was the Gospel I thought it
[52:13] was Jesus Christ see that's why I Don't
[52:16] Preach like these other preachers preach
[52:18] I'm I'm just sorry you get you another
[52:19] one cuz yeah I'm just not made to preach
[52:22] like
[52:24] that I didn't get saved that way
[52:28] way I didn't get saved by somebody
[52:30] telling me how bad I was I didn't have
[52:32] any trouble I already knew it that's
[52:34] right that's right didn't
[52:37] you right I sure didn't think I was
[52:40] going to heaven because how good I was
[52:44] right that's when I was 18 years old for
[52:46] I even converted to baptist church
[52:48] because I seen what the way they were
[52:50] trying to bring
[52:51] us they were not trying to bring us to
[52:54] Christ they were trying to bring us to a
[52:56] church or a group or a situation or some
[53:00] Doctrine or rules or regulations or some
[53:03] Creed to
[53:06] quote that's why I told them you know
[53:08] I've told you many
[53:10] times when they come to me about coming
[53:12] to church I said listen I'll live a
[53:14] better life as a sinner than a lot of
[53:15] your Deacon board does and but they
[53:17] wouldn't argue with me about it cuz they
[53:20] knew that I could quote pretty good
[53:23] about their
[53:25] Deacons and you know what I found one
[53:28] day where the Prophet made a
[53:30] statement about it and I realized that
[53:33] was me he said you know you got to get
[53:35] over the church to be
[53:37] saved now don't ask me to do that a
[53:40] paraphrase form but you got to get over
[53:42] the church to be saved right and I
[53:45] realized that was what the problem was
[53:47] you know what was in my way the
[53:49] church right I I'm honest and tell you
[53:52] when I joined that Baptist Church I had
[53:53] to come to that realization Lord get
[53:56] back get get away let me get from this
[53:58] that's their business between me and you
[54:00] lord it's not me and you and all the how
[54:02] good they are
[54:05] right but you
[54:07] see oh get off of it
[54:12] blessing God chose to
[54:19] condescend all
[54:21] right and I got a quote in here
[54:23] somewhere I got one at the house where
[54:25] brother around and said God God knew his
[54:28] first little bride in the garden
[54:32] Eve would
[54:35] fall he knew that or else he wasn't God
[54:39] but here's the rest of the story he said
[54:42] he knew but there was a bride that was
[54:47] predestinated not to
[54:52] fall you see we got to get saved before
[54:56] we have the ability to fall
[55:01] right but you see he condescended
[55:04] downward to reveal
[55:06] himself as I said sure a whole world has
[55:09] the ability to to the the people that's
[55:12] never heard have a longing within their
[55:15] heart and a a desire to serve some form
[55:18] of a Creator no matter how much they
[55:19] call them themselves atheist I call them
[55:21] idiots because if you're if you say
[55:24] you're an atheist and don't believe in
[55:25] God you believe you're greater than God
[55:27] so that solves a
[55:29] problem but you see he knew that this
[55:32] would
[55:34] be but he knew there was a little
[55:40] rde he knew there was a little and the
[55:42] brother ROM was covering the story a lot
[55:44] right that there was a little old Eagle
[55:46] that had a couple of
[55:49] eggs
[55:52] right she knew she had a coup of eggs
[55:58] one of them got
[55:59] missing now you didn't tell both got
[56:01] missing now you have a problem one of
[56:04] them got missing and wound up in a
[56:06] chicken
[56:07] yard that's where we
[56:10] were he knew he had children that would
[56:13] wind up in this world in a lost
[56:15] condition doomed and on our way to
[56:18] hell cuz we would be mortal people under
[56:21] sin you can't make an eternal sinner
[56:24] right
[56:27] don't try to give eternal life to a
[56:28] sinner no it doesn't
[56:31] work cuz you have an eternal
[56:35] sinner you see
[56:39] then as he would do that then that
[56:41] little
[56:42] Eagle would be an attribute of
[56:46] God right that little Eagle was a child
[56:50] of that
[56:52] eagle that was flying right with no
[56:55] chicken
[56:57] never was a chicken just born to a
[57:01] chicken that's right well brother Dale
[57:05] the only problem with the way you bring
[57:06] things you bring it down to we always
[57:08] was
[57:09] eternal now I've never taught you that
[57:12] so you don't go
[57:14] off I've always taught you and I'll give
[57:16] you the quotes through here in a little
[57:17] bit if I have time don't we'll take them
[57:19] up next Wednesday or whenever we get
[57:23] back you know yourself that I've always
[57:25] told you you got to taught you you got
[57:27] to have the new birth to be to have
[57:29] eternal life so don't think you come
[57:32] into the world with eternal life in you
[57:35] that you don't need eternal life you
[57:37] come into the world with a seat of
[57:39] representation from
[57:41] predestination that God knew you would
[57:44] want eternal life and he had it for you
[57:47] but that didn't mean you come into the
[57:48] world with eternal life you I got quote
[57:51] well go ahead and quote all right go on
[57:54] just remember you're going to come back
[57:55] to the bases that the prophet said you
[57:58] get eternal life right here at the
[58:00] altar you're going to come back to the
[58:02] bases were we Spirits brother
[58:05] random no we wouldn't nothing right we
[58:08] were just in his thinking
[58:11] right so you're going to have to come
[58:13] back and face those or you going to have
[58:15] to say he was wrong on them so go do
[58:17] what you want to you ain't going to
[58:18] change I'm not trying to change
[58:21] nobody I'm trying to preach the gospel
[58:23] let God convert us all
[58:27] you see what I'm talking about what is
[58:29] an attribute we hit it just a little bit
[58:32] I want to hit it just a little bit
[58:34] tonight what is an
[58:40] attribute now brother random said in God
[58:43] was
[58:45] attributes he said it was in him to be a
[58:49] Healer to be a savior to be a
[58:53] deliverer to be all of the things we see
[58:56] the Bible The Advocate the the unction
[58:59] the the teachers the the all the things
[59:02] that we would ever find in the Bible
[59:04] that would be related to God would be an
[59:07] attribute of God and he had that before
[59:09] the world ever begun right right he
[59:13] didn't become a
[59:14] Healer he just displayed that that
[59:17] healing Factor he didn't become a savior
[59:20] he displayed that upon Earth
[59:24] see but yet in him was attribute what is
[59:27] an attribute say it's a part of
[59:33] God he said it's a part of
[59:37] God I got a quote in here we'll get to
[59:40] it minute we don't I'll get to it later
[59:42] butom said that Jesus was
[59:44] a offspring of
[59:52] God well that's two
[59:54] people see
[59:58] that's father
[1:00:03] son not if that Offspring is God that's
[1:00:08] right you ain't got two people that's
[1:00:11] right now get what I'm talking about
[1:00:12] attributes so we just going to go
[1:00:14] through these things and if I have to
[1:00:15] I'll take months on just each one of the
[1:00:17] words just one thing at a
[1:00:19] time and don't bother
[1:00:22] me we've had 40 something years I don't
[1:00:25] think you ought to worry about it now
[1:00:27] you know maybe we're getting old enough
[1:00:29] to sit down and listen maybe we've run
[1:00:32] our course enough to to get through
[1:00:34] things I got some tickle the other day
[1:00:36] hearing brother Brown when even said it
[1:00:38] you get it listen to it he explains the
[1:00:40] four stages of life he said from 1 to 25
[1:00:43] 25 to 50 50 to 75 75 to
[1:00:47] 100 he said it's all right down here on
[1:00:49] that 1 to 25 if you out running around
[1:00:51] after
[1:00:53] women that may be a paraphrase but it's
[1:00:57] you know well I always tell you you
[1:01:00] marry 90% of marriage is harmonal
[1:01:02] factors how you say those words you know
[1:01:05] you know no it was love at first sight
[1:01:09] no no it was it was harmones working in
[1:01:12] both of
[1:01:13] you then you learn to love right right
[1:01:17] amen all right you know you Mar lust you
[1:01:20] say no we made you see you don't
[1:01:22] understand me so go
[1:01:24] ahead you know it's true
[1:01:29] but
[1:01:32] listen if we are his
[1:01:37] attributes
[1:01:40] right
[1:01:43] yeah then his attributes are
[1:01:48] Eternal right that's what I said I won't
[1:01:51] preach on the you say but oh I got you
[1:01:53] now cuz ain't no such thing as Eternal
[1:01:55] he
[1:01:56] you better back up just a little bit and
[1:01:58] wait cuz one of these days these body's
[1:02:00] going to be changed that'll be Eternal
[1:02:01] healing if you don't want take that far
[1:02:03] but you're healing if you're healed
[1:02:05] today and die tomorrow you were
[1:02:06] eternally healed
[1:02:08] today I'll get back and preach on that
[1:02:10] one of these years cuz I just saw what
[1:02:12] brother R he said even as a Healer is he
[1:02:15] he's
[1:02:20] Eternal see that's why we don't look at
[1:02:22] it that way we quote by strip I hope I'm
[1:02:26] Healed my I think I'm Healed my maybe
[1:02:29] I'm
[1:02:29] Healed that's why we're not
[1:02:33] healed but when we look at it just as
[1:02:35] well as we say but we don't dare do that
[1:02:38] about our Salvation right we don't dare
[1:02:40] say I think I'm saved I hope I'm sa
[1:02:42] maybe I'm safe but one you know we don't
[1:02:44] do that now we don't we've got away from
[1:02:46] that we want anchor that in good cuz
[1:02:48] that that has to do with
[1:02:50] eternity but if the atonement is made I
[1:02:54] thought by his stripes we were healed
[1:02:56] the same as one my transgression Bru for
[1:02:58] iniquity with the stries for he I
[1:03:00] thought was all one
[1:03:02] atonement he eternally healed
[1:03:07] us I know you can be sick and you need
[1:03:10] healing again I know all about that but
[1:03:12] you're not
[1:03:13] listening see we're talking about
[1:03:16] eternal
[1:03:19] life Jesus was the very attribute of God
[1:03:26] you know why cuz he was
[1:03:30] God right he was
[1:03:35] God because he was that
[1:03:37] attribute he was love he was Joy he was
[1:03:41] all the thing all that was in God is
[1:03:44] placed into Christ
[1:03:47] right not another
[1:03:53] God I mean if I've going thises y'all
[1:03:56] just go ahead but I've never heard of
[1:03:59] oness preached like this so I'm not
[1:04:01] worried about
[1:04:03] it but listen look at your
[1:04:06] first note you got there and I told you
[1:04:09] now that I was going to be using the new
[1:04:11] 21 version okay the uh what they call it
[1:04:15] the table that what it's called the
[1:04:18] table it's a new version because of
[1:04:20] transfer having to transfer everything
[1:04:22] over here to be be able to get into the
[1:04:24] computer system all right because it it
[1:04:27] just won't work trying to put all of our
[1:04:29] stuff in other words brother Joe's got
[1:04:31] to go back there and go into the message
[1:04:33] get it over here come back over here and
[1:04:35] get it over here pull it back over here
[1:04:36] to be able to get it in the message so I
[1:04:38] I've changed and I'm using that and the
[1:04:41] reason you'll know you look out there at
[1:04:42] the beginning right up there you see
[1:04:44] that little thing look like a speaker
[1:04:45] well what that means is if you got that
[1:04:47] version and you can connect on you can
[1:04:49] just click on that around and read that
[1:04:51] to
[1:04:53] you right that's what that little
[1:04:55] speaker thing means if you just click on
[1:04:57] it and he'll read it to you yeah know
[1:05:00] and and things so it'll help you but you
[1:05:02] know if anybody would like to get the
[1:05:04] other version of the 2010 I you know we
[1:05:07] will try our best to to help you to get
[1:05:10] what uh you know you want and while I'm
[1:05:12] talking about on the Jenson book I I
[1:05:14] told him the other day at home that we
[1:05:16] would buy all the books for anybody that
[1:05:19] wants the
[1:05:20] books the Jorgenson book the number six
[1:05:23] we will buy the book but now if you want
[1:05:25] to consider I mean the CDs that goes
[1:05:27] with it you're going to have to buy
[1:05:29] it so you know go ahead and tell sister
[1:05:31] Lisa whatever and if you want it say
[1:05:33] well I can't afford it you you do we'll
[1:05:35] buy the book for you but we won't buy
[1:05:38] the the CDs cuz they're a little more
[1:05:40] expensive to have to buy those MP3s
[1:05:43] orever what it's on but all right we'll
[1:05:44] do that but listen look what your
[1:05:47] Prophet had to say now on the message
[1:05:49] identifi Christ of all ages preached in
[1:05:51] 1964 401 which would be paragraph 1
[1:05:56] go down to the middle what's underlined
[1:05:58] he is now in
[1:06:00] you you are his
[1:06:03] attributes watch it if you've got
[1:06:07] eternal
[1:06:09] life now there's a
[1:06:12] question right your life always
[1:06:17] was now that's not your natural life
[1:06:22] right that is not your natural life what
[1:06:25] I think that's my natural I know and
[1:06:27] that's not I'm sorry what you need Jesus
[1:06:29] for if you don't know those things
[1:06:32] listen and you was God's thinking listen
[1:06:36] to it the color of your
[1:06:40] hair now Sister I'd be careful about
[1:06:43] dying
[1:06:47] man original
[1:06:52] color you're not going to be a brunette
[1:06:54] here in the world and get over there and
[1:06:57] be in a glorified body and be
[1:07:01] blackheaded that's right Ain certainly
[1:07:03] ain't going to be
[1:07:04] great so you know go ahead I'm say men
[1:07:08] too cuz a lot of men die their high too
[1:07:09] so that's just as well you
[1:07:12] know so the Bible says you can't add one
[1:07:15] high to your what is ITB one cubit see
[1:07:20] you can't add a high to you cuz God's W
[1:07:22] to give you all that well then you can't
[1:07:24] add any colors cuz going to come back
[1:07:27] original you may fool us while you're
[1:07:29] here but when we get over there choice
[1:07:31] we going to know it's the same
[1:07:35] color okay get you the life a little bit
[1:07:38] to raise you up Mr all right sometimes
[1:07:40] you get this kind of
[1:07:42] typ all right
[1:07:45] listen he is now in you you are his
[1:07:49] attributes if you got eternal life your
[1:07:52] life always was and you was God's
[1:07:55] thinking
[1:07:55] the color of your high whatever you are
[1:07:58] you was God's thinking and you're just
[1:08:02] materialized and that's what God was
[1:08:04] when he was materialized in
[1:08:08] Christ amen God displayed manifested in
[1:08:13] flesh in
[1:08:16] Christ he became
[1:08:19] material that we could touch see then he
[1:08:21] goes to First Timothy going through all
[1:08:25] though he we're his
[1:08:30] attributes and an attribute of God is
[1:08:35] eternal all
[1:08:37] right well see we didn't come into the
[1:08:39] world with eternal
[1:08:44] life if we did we don't need Jesus right
[1:08:48] all that would be in vain see all you
[1:08:50] need to know is a knowledge you have
[1:08:51] eternal life I believe we must come here
[1:08:55] and rece receive eternal life but that
[1:08:57] eternal
[1:08:58] life that you receive always was eternal
[1:09:03] right right we won't get to it tonight
[1:09:06] but we got a lot of it in here always
[1:09:08] was
[1:09:09] eternal Jesus was God's
[1:09:13] attribute and we are just God's
[1:09:15] attribute did display now we're not
[1:09:17] going to hurt nobody's feelings I hope
[1:09:20] you see the foolish virgin giv eternal
[1:09:23] life is not an attribute of God that's
[1:09:25] an attribute that would be displayed
[1:09:28] because of the situation of life that we
[1:09:30] exist in and you know be given unto them
[1:09:35] you understand it right so they're not
[1:09:38] part of
[1:09:40] it everybody in the world is a child of
[1:09:44] God by
[1:09:46] creation amen right by creation God
[1:09:50] permitted us to come into flesh no
[1:09:52] matter how many billion trillions of
[1:09:54] what they are in the world never will
[1:09:57] be but we're not talking about that
[1:10:01] we're talking about his children amen
[1:10:04] the children as I said a moment
[1:10:08] ago you can believe in birth control all
[1:10:11] you want to I laugh at people who talk
[1:10:14] about birth
[1:10:17] control no just remember when you start
[1:10:19] talking about your birth control I'm
[1:10:21] laughing at
[1:10:22] you I don't mean that wrong
[1:10:26] I just mean it's
[1:10:28] truth we're going to be held accountable
[1:10:30] for what we
[1:10:32] do with the functions we have of the
[1:10:35] abilities whatever you want to call it
[1:10:37] without getting too far into
[1:10:39] it but you tell me there's going to be a
[1:10:42] bunch of bodies left up there you know
[1:10:44] around here in the world and there ain't
[1:10:46] no souls to put in them or there's a
[1:10:47] bunch of souls you know and and no
[1:10:49] bodies going to go in now I don't agree
[1:10:52] with
[1:10:54] that who was it now some of you you
[1:10:56] don't have to tell who it was but it's
[1:10:57] around here that that there was a man
[1:10:59] and a woman
[1:11:01] both both of them had the what they VI
[1:11:05] sectomy for the man and whatever you
[1:11:06] call it tubes tied for the
[1:11:09] woman both of them
[1:11:11] had and you know now they got a
[1:11:15] child you said well what it was she was
[1:11:17] slipping around well her tubes got
[1:11:19] untied some
[1:11:23] way you know
[1:11:26] right say no such thing as birth
[1:11:31] control I said we will be
[1:11:34] responsible for what we do with the
[1:11:37] functions that God give
[1:11:39] us but there's no such thing as birth
[1:11:42] control we can't control
[1:11:44] birth God controls
[1:11:51] birth now I keep saying it we'll be
[1:11:53] responsible for what we do with
[1:11:59] things you say bless God I'm we just
[1:12:02] ain't going to have no kids well you
[1:12:04] might get a surprise one
[1:12:06] day you know yeah those things do
[1:12:11] happen
[1:12:13] you Butz I don't think we're in a modern
[1:12:15] civilization I remember a brother here
[1:12:16] one time preaching how that Joseph you
[1:12:19] know when he went down to SL into
[1:12:20] slavery you know and down into Egypt for
[1:12:22] slavery said see they always cerated all
[1:12:25] the
[1:12:26] slaves you know I just I I got up behind
[1:12:30] him I said I just can't help it but I
[1:12:32] said come find out you had two
[1:12:35] kids they must have known some way to
[1:12:37] restore that
[1:12:39] ceration that's not a joke it's just
[1:12:41] showing we don't play with
[1:12:43] God but don't play with his word either
[1:12:46] cuz it'll face us right we think this
[1:12:49] looks good because we read it they C
[1:12:51] they you know all the servants had to be
[1:12:54] and then come find out Joseph was a
[1:12:56] servant and there he was why was Piper's
[1:12:58] wife after him if he was
[1:13:01] just right come on but you see we think
[1:13:04] we know what we're talking
[1:13:08] about because we've heard this brother
[1:13:12] so so talk I don't care who s it you me
[1:13:15] or who it is what does it say about the
[1:13:16] word come on right all
[1:13:20] right
[1:13:22] now we believe that Jesus was a very
[1:13:25] attribute of God cuz he was
[1:13:28] God all
[1:13:30] right you and I are the display upon
[1:13:33] Earth as by salvation now receiving
[1:13:36] salvation we become the attributes of
[1:13:39] God upon Earth amen called The Bride the
[1:13:41] body the church the people the children
[1:13:44] the the all of those words we were using
[1:13:46] while ago the right husband I mean the
[1:13:51] wife the the the
[1:13:53] bride right
[1:13:58] but you see then that doesn't make
[1:14:01] trinitarianism right cuz you're not one
[1:14:03] person and God another that's right you
[1:14:06] got a problem there
[1:14:08] right if he was God made manifest in
[1:14:11] flesh by the new birth we become God
[1:14:13] made manifest in flesh I believe that's
[1:14:15] is where our human mind can't follow
[1:14:17] that strong enough you say brother you
[1:14:19] get a little too strong no that's not
[1:14:20] strong
[1:14:22] enough oh my
[1:14:25] all right do we believe that point and
[1:14:27] let me get another one then we'll tied
[1:14:28] up on this one you believe that Jesus
[1:14:31] was an offspring of
[1:14:33] God
[1:14:35] yes all
[1:14:37] right now was he a Son of God a second
[1:14:41] person
[1:14:44] no or was he God made
[1:14:49] manifest in another form
[1:14:52] right called a son right
[1:14:58] that's and that would make him an
[1:15:05] offspring now the Bible says he's the
[1:15:07] only
[1:15:09] begotten of the father right
[1:15:13] amen
[1:15:15] right now he was begotten by
[1:15:21] impartation by creation by who he was
[1:15:25] now I'm quoting brother
[1:15:32] randam he was an offspring of
[1:15:35] God God in another
[1:15:38] form called a son
[1:15:43] right he was the only begotten the
[1:15:46] scripture
[1:15:47] says so now we wasn't in him in how he
[1:15:51] was begotten
[1:15:56] you agreed while to go now are you still
[1:15:58] agreeing with me if we wouldn't in
[1:16:02] him the only way to have eternal
[1:16:09] life how was he
[1:16:12] begotten now naturally he was begotten
[1:16:15] into the wound and not brought the body
[1:16:18] of
[1:16:19] Mary right but spiritually he was
[1:16:22] begotten in the form that he stepped
[1:16:25] over into to become the word that's
[1:16:28] right yes sir so he's the only begotten
[1:16:31] you know what you and I begotten by him
[1:16:35] now but wait a minute Brother D I've
[1:16:36] heard you say 4,000 times that we're not
[1:16:38] a son of Jesus that we a Son of God I'll
[1:16:40] say it again we're not a son of Jesus a
[1:16:42] Son of God there's no such thing cuz
[1:16:44] that make Eternal sunship we don't agree
[1:16:46] with
[1:16:48] it but see he had in
[1:16:53] him what we have have to have to be a
[1:16:56] child of God
[1:16:59] Amen you agree he had in him what I have
[1:17:03] to
[1:17:04] have he was begotten and if I wasn't in
[1:17:08] him that
[1:17:11] way I never will be
[1:17:15] right so I gave you a quote that word
[1:17:17] brother R gives it on U believest thou
[1:17:20] this 1950 7:16 remember Jesus had all
[1:17:24] the qualiity of the father in
[1:17:27] him do you believe that sure he did all
[1:17:31] the fine gifts of God was in Christ his
[1:17:33] son for he was The Offspring of
[1:17:39] God he goes on to say I see he didn't
[1:17:41] use any of his gifts against
[1:17:43] Satan he used the word because he knew
[1:17:45] how to handle it all right but he was
[1:17:48] The Offspring of God what a wonderful
[1:17:52] thought God having children
[1:18:01] but see we're tied up into the human
[1:18:02] element of our thinking right for me to
[1:18:06] have a child I had to have a
[1:18:10] wife
[1:18:13] sensible no problems right I mean it
[1:18:16] generally takes two like brother Bown
[1:18:18] said that's why that they can't do it
[1:18:19] with all this business about said you
[1:18:21] know remember talking to man said well
[1:18:23] what it was said it was just a polywog
[1:18:25] and then it was this and the W and he
[1:18:27] said now according to your
[1:18:31] science it
[1:18:33] takes a male and a female to bring forth
[1:18:35] a child whatever you want to call it
[1:18:37] worms whatever whatever the me yeah
[1:18:39] that's right he said but then who was
[1:18:41] the who was the
[1:18:45] wife of the pow
[1:18:48] walk you know in other words where did
[1:18:51] the polywog come from had to be a male
[1:18:53] and female something to bring a
[1:18:57] polywog right cuz you tou a male to
[1:19:00] female to bring a child right see and
[1:19:03] the man couldn't answer
[1:19:04] it see because it destroyed his poliwog
[1:19:07] his poliwog was just a one form ofia
[1:19:11] what do you call it amiba family one
[1:19:14] side well then how can a one-sided thing
[1:19:16] ever produce a
[1:19:19] two-sided oh it just rolled over on this
[1:19:21] other side and grow an AR that grow over
[1:19:23] here and roll gr a lag
[1:19:27] yeah but
[1:19:31] listen he was an
[1:19:37] offspring he was
[1:19:40] God in another
[1:19:43] form
[1:19:46] amen
[1:19:49] right and whatever I
[1:19:52] said that I have to have
[1:19:56] and even me being I had to be there
[1:19:59] brother BR said we walked the shores of
[1:20:02] Galilee in
[1:20:04] him now click your
[1:20:06] mind was James and John and Peter and
[1:20:14] them they was walking beside of
[1:20:18] him
[1:20:20] right
[1:20:22] Hallelujah but Jesus said
[1:20:25] I chose you
[1:20:30] right you was in me come
[1:20:36] on now what was that talking
[1:20:39] about not the human flesh it was
[1:20:41] standing right there walking Al long see
[1:20:43] we can get over into the great
[1:20:45] understanding that we are over here
[1:20:47] where we could have been some way
[1:20:49] genetic you know no then Peter James and
[1:20:52] John and then was standing right there
[1:20:53] beside of him right
[1:20:59] but you
[1:21:00] see what was in him is what Peter needed
[1:21:05] right you agree
[1:21:07] right what was in Jesus was eternal life
[1:21:10] amen right right and that's what Peter
[1:21:14] needed to make him a child
[1:21:16] right that's three years of so in the
[1:21:19] ministry that it took the Lord Jesus to
[1:21:21] get Peter and him ready to be able to
[1:21:23] bring him forth his child is to bring
[1:21:25] children on the earth on the day of
[1:21:27] Pentecost to where he could expand
[1:21:30] himself
[1:21:32] right and bring it forth
[1:21:35] okay now we back up cuz we're not going
[1:21:38] to be able to finish
[1:21:40] it let me just get that next one number
[1:21:43] three on your notes and then we'll get
[1:21:45] back we'll come right back to this
[1:21:47] Offspring and you just keep these notes
[1:21:49] and you know if you don't we'll print
[1:21:50] off some more but keep them if you
[1:21:52] candle next Wednesday
[1:21:56] brother said an identified Masterpiece
[1:21:58] of God preaching 19 in human Arizona
[1:22:01] 1964
[1:22:03] 125 now we notice that God begin to make
[1:22:07] him a bride for
[1:22:10] Christ so and the bride must be
[1:22:12] identified with him and in him because
[1:22:17] it is part of
[1:22:19] him now the bride is part of him right
[1:22:22] she is part of him
[1:22:25] the word for that
[1:22:27] day the bride becomes part of that word
[1:22:30] for it's
[1:22:32] Christ and you believe that congregation
[1:22:35] says amen I ain't heard amen yet okay we
[1:22:39] have to be in Christ in Christ we have
[1:22:41] to be of
[1:22:44] Christ in Christ part of
[1:22:48] Christ right now I I didn't miss reading
[1:22:51] that you all right what what did he say
[1:22:55] where we have to be of Christ in Christ
[1:22:59] part of
[1:23:00] Christ am I don't leave nothing out do
[1:23:03] it that brings us over in this world we
[1:23:06] can accept Jesus Christ as our savior
[1:23:07] and we can be of Christ and we can be up
[1:23:10] in Christ and we can be back before the
[1:23:11] world and we can have the Morning Star
[1:23:13] sing together the sons of God sh for joy
[1:23:16] we can have all of that so what is a
[1:23:19] woman when she takes a man or a man
[1:23:20] takes a woman that woman has to be part
[1:23:22] of him there are no longer two there one
[1:23:25] and when God and Christ became one they
[1:23:27] were one because God was the word and
[1:23:31] the Word was made flesh and the Flesh
[1:23:34] and the word became one and when the
[1:23:36] church becomes Christ bride she and the
[1:23:38] gospels are the same how can you say
[1:23:42] then the days of Miracles is
[1:23:47] passed how can you say it when you're a
[1:23:50] part of
[1:23:51] him now couple years down the road we
[1:23:55] get back on that
[1:23:56] quote how can you say the days of
[1:23:59] Miracles has passed if you're a
[1:24:00] Christian
[1:24:02] okay brother R said a Christian believes
[1:24:04] in the Supernatural
[1:24:07] right believes in the
[1:24:10] Supernatural right a
[1:24:16] Christian how can a Christian say the
[1:24:19] days of Miracles has
[1:24:22] passed see where we get into trou will
[1:24:24] say I just don't see much going
[1:24:26] on well are we doubting
[1:24:30] God I see the greatest of all things
[1:24:33] taking
[1:24:35] place a bride getting
[1:24:38] ready to meet her savior
[1:24:43] am learning about him like uh who is it
[1:24:48] Ruth no excuse me um La eer going after
[1:24:53] a bride bringing back Rebecca okay I'll
[1:24:54] get the right name when Rebecca got
[1:24:56] there she knew so much about what he
[1:24:58] looked like she didn't have to be told
[1:24:59] she jumped off the camel and took off
[1:25:01] running she saw him out in the
[1:25:04] field she knew who that
[1:25:07] was she knew if he sent after her she
[1:25:10] didn't have to put on no gown she didn't
[1:25:13] have to take a
[1:25:16] bath right remember this would have had
[1:25:20] to been somewhere up in the
[1:25:23] day and she rode that Camel that
[1:25:26] day you ever smelled a
[1:25:30] camel we were over in Israel and uh
[1:25:34] there were selling things you know well
[1:25:36] I asked the fell and he said this is a
[1:25:38] camel belt I said how in the world I
[1:25:41] know that thing was made from a camel he
[1:25:43] said here smell of it you solve the
[1:25:47] problem but I had a chance to ride on
[1:25:49] the camel for a few
[1:25:52] minutes 3 months after woman rode that
[1:25:55] Camel I don't care whether the two hump
[1:25:57] or one hump or what how many humps it
[1:25:59] had this is the way we
[1:26:02] went I wanted it to run wide open cuz
[1:26:04] maybe it would smooth out but that
[1:26:06] sucker was just like
[1:26:08] that 3
[1:26:11] months now you know what I'm talking
[1:26:13] about just trying to be
[1:26:16] sensible if they got up in the morning
[1:26:18] and they started riding and maybe they
[1:26:19] rode 2 hours or 4 hours or 8 hours or
[1:26:22] how many hours she smelt like everything
[1:26:26] M it doesn't say she got took her a bath
[1:26:29] and right powdered
[1:26:31] and you know

[1:27:27] ugly he get him a beautiful
[1:27:29] woman but he wanted beautiful character
[1:27:32] more than anything in the
[1:27:34] world she sure didn't smell too good
