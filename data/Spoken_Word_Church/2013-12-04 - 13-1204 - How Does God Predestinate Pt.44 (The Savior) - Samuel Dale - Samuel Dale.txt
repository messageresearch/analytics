Luke 2 excuse me Father we thank you for your grace and your loving to us we thank you for all things and we Praise Your Great Name because you are The Great I Am thank you for all things for healing

doing better she's so we're we're glad of that yeah Romans 8. and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his sons he is a process in your predestination it's not just this oh we got you know there's a process conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren for whom he did predestinate then he also called in whom he called him he also justified in whom he justified let me also glorified what shall we then say to these things if God be for us who can be against us right okay look over to Luke 2. thank you we'll begin reading with verse 8. just to get the point for tonight and there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field keeping watch over their flock by night and lo the angel of the Lord Came Upon them and the glory of the Lord Shone round about them and they were so afraid and the angel said unto them fear not the whole for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people for unto you is Born This Day in the city of David a savior which is Christ the lord you may be seated the Lord had his blessing upon the reading of the word now trying to get to a point to get back into our thoughts of predestination and I hope that what we've been through has been trying to bring some things to that and bringing it to that point we're glad to have our visitor back there with us and I think this is his first time being here and we always say welcome when you come as a visitor you get a welcome one time and only just part of us so we don't have anything to join we're just part of the body of Christ let me just pray that you'll have a good time with us all right now talking about our Sunday ideas Sunday afternoon I just preached a message I didn't um I didn't use uh any quotes or anything I just tried to bring the the thought to you as to one message from the beginning of the foundation of the world back there before the world ever begun and bringing it down and coming through and coming through the Old Testament and coming out to Jesus Christ and then I went on through as just a little just clicking a little to where we'd have an understanding of The Plan of Redemption and then coming out into the end time to see uh you know where we are and are part of it all right and that's that's more or less what I was trying to bring is just put it into a one message thought to where we could uh could just look at it openly without reading a lot and saying a lot I hope you enjoyed it but I pray that the Lord would help us all right now we know that for you know we know truly that God had a plan and a purpose that he was going to achieve this is not the story of you and I you know that's what we want to make it ah me I I'm this I and that doesn't work too good it's the Plan of Redemption for God to show what he done because that's what it is see it is he that has made us enough we ourselves remember he created us we we didn't create him you said we created us yeah he had to create Us in the wound of Mama I mean from Mama and from Daddy and allow it that'll be made that away brought us into being right but God had a plan and a purpose and that plan and purpose was to display himself through his attributes that he had in him before the world ever begun before anything ever came into being he didn't gain attributes coming down you know he displayed attributes coming down he already had all of those attributes his savior healer deliverer Etc all right but there was no way to make that manifest when he created man that could have made manifest him when he created angels that could make manifest him being God the word god which means the Angels could worship Him all right and then his I was trying to bring out the other day on the body and I want to get a little more into that tonight too that you know he could have brought all of us into being and given us eternal life and it would have been a beautiful picture but that wouldn't have displayed any of his attributes that would have made him a father just as the Angels worship Him made him God huh see then he would come out to be father because that would mean he would have offspring and that would have been beautiful but that would not have displayed his attributes as Savior healer Etc all right so now God couldn't devise a plan now I'll get to that in a minute because I got my notes he couldn't make a plan as we think about it well he just he just done it this way no he had to do it whatever God would do he had to do it where he could never be brought into question right because if he could be brought into question about it then he would be just like you and I so we go to Christ the mystery of God reveal he had a plan and a purpose and it was a great mystery right in that plan and purpose and that it would be that he would create us perfect because he cannot create anything any other way you say well look at me he made me this way he didn't make you an eye center a little baby laying in a and there you know just from the Mama's wound it's it's it's perfect because you could ever see anything to be because of the way it is all right God cannot bring forth you say well a baby's born with a disease that's because of the domain we're in the genetics Etc it's not what God made he couldn't make us a sinner as I keep saying and then save us that would be defeating his purpose what anybody that's perfect to start with like come on think about it why didn't he just make us perfect to start with because that would have not made his attributes come into being right and we wouldn't love him you say oh yes we would love him may I remind you and I know I don't like to be this way but this is just my way I guess you say he just made us we'd have been perfect I remember the fact in the word that it teaches it he made Adam and Eve perfect not Eternal you know in bodies but even to have eternal life in their soul see we think old if God was just to make me perfect I would never do nothing wrong why do we do wrong even after having eternal life in our soul and as much as God has done for us come on well brother Dale I don't do wrong well pray for me all right I'm a sinner saved by grace all right and I got to keep confessing that all right now we don't go out and you know Corrals and drinking and gambling no no no no no no that's supposed to went away with a new birth if it if we do that we're lost that's right that's no problem but yet why didn't he just make us perfect he made Adam and Eve perfect amen but they fail oh if he just made me first oh yeah yeah Gloria Hallelujah if it had just obeyed you first it wouldn't have been no fall baloney remember he made Adam and Eve as perfect as perfect could be and they fail yep because the only thing he done was give him a choice we want to blame this we want to blame that I got in my notes Here on just a thought I wrote like this instead of us trying to believe what has been done said taught Etc and accepting that we've got to try to figure it out we got to figure out how it works you know yeah if we can figure out how it works it's not by faith right amen you know what I'm talking about we're not satisfied with your saying I believe it thank you Lord I believe it we want to figure out how that the cow eats a green grass it goes into the bellies it goes to the walls it turns from one color to the other it goes through water's added we want to figure it all out I'd rather just drink them yeah forget it because y'all wouldn't raise like we was we had to drink milk that had wild onions in it or we didn't drink any milk but I never tried to figure it out I just got me a big old onion and ate the sucker while I was drinking the milk because that's the only way you could do it yes old country folks didn't have enough sense to figure out how to get that defect out of it we just had to use it all right but now listen the only thing that we found now I've been hard on this I know the only thing that we found wrong or not wrong excuse me the only thing that we found that uh came into being was free more agency and I've talked to you I don't believe Eve was so um you know no I don't believe that I've taught you what I believe that that Beast talked to her and begin to reason with her about motherhood and how that was what she was made for until that brought up into her the desire to bring forth children but you know that was on the free moral agency point that is the point of free more lady that's not creating somebody wrong we want to blame everything on Eve when the Bible says in Adam all die but the same thing about an eve I'll die is he had a choice he had a free Mortal agency choice right he could have said I ain't gonna take her no but see God foreknew all of these things and we've been through that the brother said God knew if he created us even perfect you know we'd still fall he knew that but in YouTube by doing that that away that he would be able to display his attributes and that he wasn't as I tried to preach to you he wouldn't stay in the garden and leave man and run him out he came out of the garden when I was trying to get across Sunday there he came out of the garden to associate himself with mankind the very people that had turned him down he done everything he could do to try to get him to straighten up and do right right but the problem was that we as Mankind in by the Fall was brought into Satan's domain or Kingdom then would be born in sin see if it in iniquity spoused from her mother's wound the psalmist David says and go forth a liar so anything that came after the Fallen condition would come that way you see God then immediately I've got a note in here a minute but I want to read something right around and say yes and I was reading and I thought oh Lord he said well how come you've been over this and over this and over this so much because somebody's not getting it I'll read that quote in a minute all right that's it that's maybe me bear with me till I get it all right but see when he gave man a free moral agency a choice he knew that we would fall by his foreknowledge but he also knew he would set out immediately to redeem the Fallen mankind they're in the garden I told you he put the skins on Adam and Eve made an atonement bloody skins I put enmity between thy seed and the seed of the woman how much of the coming Messiah right that would come to save you and I am and that coming Messiah would be the way to display the attributes of healer savior Redeemer right amen amen then he would ordain away you mind that word prepare ordained a way to save man a way that man would be lost by allowing us to come with a choice ordain in it see then making it work Ed that he could come and fulfill his plan all right as I said I think instead of us believing what has been done and accepting it we try to figure out how it happened you know all right instead of believing it why not just believe what God says amen amen be a whole lot easier right you know not let's think about this plan and purpose of God you know that God wanted to display his attributes we've been through that a lot but he wanted to share his own life amen right he wanted to share his own life with mankind what a beautiful picture I had this quote and I want to read and it's quite a lengthy one I've had it laying on my desk for about three months I guess and I thought Lord I need to just read that whole thing to worry that we could see really the truth of what God's plan and purpose was he said when he wanted to be a savior he wanted to be a Healer that's wonderful and I believe that and that's part of the plan but what about him wanting to share his own life amen with his people that he created and by sharing his own life would actually make us his offspring there's more to it than just say a savior now come on the foolish virgins get saved one day right Jews get saved one day a cup of water in my name could bring you salvation one day Mr healer right because you know what Divine Healing is an example of a glorified body right healing is an example of the fact that one day we will be eternally healed Joyce more than just think of a plan and a purpose or to be a savior to be a Healer could happen and not have a thing in the world to do I hope you're listening I'm trying to be just dead serious as I can because I know the hour that we're living we're very close what that means I don't care 20 years what I care be an old man but I'll wobble up here and still preach as long as I got a brain left you just pray for the brain don't worry about the body it's got to be getting older pray for the brain to stay all right and then even pray that God can use a thing if it wears out but listen do you follow me we're looking at things and trying to instead of taking the statement and analyze it don't try to figure it out analyze what it's saying there's a lot of difference in analyzing or looking at something you know and and studying it through the word than it is to try to figure it out right yep but he could be a savior and save the foolish virgins he could be a Healer and heal anybody today see I'm wanting the ultimate end of healing amen which is this body made eternal not to get a new one this one made new redeem it all right now I'm wanting the ultimate of salvation that the eternal life that I have in my soul and come out into my body and my being and it can be a future home and even the world's got to follow us right you see what I'm getting at we just say oh he's a Healer he want to be this no as I was saying there that the other day about it I know that was kind of a an odd way of me putting it but think about it Jesus Christ was almighty God right do you believe whatever he said would have had to happen and we know he couldn't say it under the father showed him so don't worry about it and he didn't do it but you realize if he could raise the Dead which he did the Lazarus right why couldn't he buy his word just stop us from dying right that's right come on don't you believe he's God oh no brother Dave we couldn't no he he didn't do that right come on what did he say about even you and I he said what we got in US if it was not controlled by a law of God we would create a world and go live on it that's right amen right but you see he could have done all of that without having to die right but that would have not released the life that was in him to where it could come back on you and I you would have just had people living forever that'd be a beautiful thing but that's not the ultimate end God's ultimate in is to share I want to read it in a minute here he wants to share his eternal life with you and I them in now according to my Bible I guess yours still reads out Jesus is supposed to be almighty God and I thought we was to be uh equal is that what scripture said and says co-equal right I thought that's what the Bible said well see it's a little more than just well they just displaying an attribute blood but now's the time to look at it and really see what's taking place to share his own life now now listen to my point without getting it all that's what I said you try to figure it out so listen this is the point of what I'm saying what about his ability what if he could just made us flesh and just stopped death in this you know everything what if he then could just give everybody in the world eternal life just he will one day give a lot of people eternal life right at the white Throne he'll give a lot of people eternal life why couldn't he just speak that while he was here and bypass the death and the things and it would have been easy for him to do his Satan was trying to tempt him do this do that do this do that he could have just said put that's it but you see that would have not been his plan and purpose his plan and purpose was to share his own life with you and I not just by listen not just by impartation was imparted eternal life right amen come on Blasphemous name read the book you're on tape listening or something he said especially into Adam and he became an eternal person with God Amen it says but you know that still wasn't God's plan yeah see you're trying to figure it out what about the the ability to do all of that but yet he wouldn't do it that away he would do it to her that you and I would have a desire in our heart and he would work according to that desire and he would give us while we are here on this Earth eternal life in our soul right by the new birth you don't have to go somewhere and get eternal life in your soul if you're born again you have it that's just that part of where we're reading in Romans about see predestinate you realize your whole life is predestinated amen well then I can't change it see that's where you're thinking right our whole life is predestinated because God knew what we do not by what we do is what he knew we'd do and we're going to do it because he knew we would that's sensible right I didn't lost my notes now but listen Church he then promised the seed of the woman to come right and through that seat of the woman which is Jesus Christ he then didn't stay in the garden he came out and one day he displayed on Earth what he really wanted he displayed eternal life in flesh what he really wanted it to be listen our will and our desire and talks had a lot to do with our predestination I'll get back onto those things but I want to just read something to you I said it's quite a lengthy reading but it'll show us I believe what I've just said go ahead and pull up number one we'll start reading this is taken from the Ephesian Church age the church age book chapter three paragraph or page 102 it'll go through quite a bit of reading now that we have come this far let me try to crystallize your thinking on this subject so you can see the necessity of our going into the serpent Seed doctrine as I have we start with the fact that there were two trees in the midst of the garden the tree of life was Jesus the other tree is definitely Satan because of what came forth of the fruit of that tree now then we know that both of those trees had a relationship to man or they would never have been placed there all right now they must have had a part in the sovereign plan and purpose of God in their relationship to mankind and to himself or we could never impute omniscience unto God okay this is all true so far is it not the word must definitely set forth that from before the foundation of the Earth the purpose of God was was what to share his eternal life with man now get the thought of what I was trying to bring him on ago get it to the point of thinking somebody else could make these things be displayed you know foolish virgin getting eternal life world the people out there being healed today right but you see I'm wanting to get into a little closer I want to be in on the plan and purpose and by doing that it's going to cost me right you know what it cost Jesus a life of horrible rejection of mankind in a day that he was beaten until he looked like a piece of hamburger meat that's just quoting brother random and then actually to die are you and I willing to die for this plan and purpose that we're talking about God didn't want us to die he wants us to live come on the purpose of God was to share his eternal life with man now he gives you the scripture Ephesians 1 4-11 according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holding Without Blame before him in love this is a special group of people right not just somebody getting eternal life not just somebody being healed I preached that this is to bring out the ultimate end of a change of a body the ultimate end of redemption and coming through the stature of a perfect man and coming all up into the adoption you know in the manifestation of God until we're that God is going to put into somebody's hand the right to speak right a lot to be done right according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation were that we should be holding Without Blame before him in love what having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will now how does he predestinate we've been over 40 something sermons how does God predestinate by his foreknowledge Now by his desires by his foreknowledge to the praise or the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted into beloved in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein Heath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence having made miss us the mystery of his will now I know I'm not going to get that far but I want to stop and just say something I know what that word means of what he's using it there you know his will his will is his desire his plan his purpose Etc but you know you spell another word exactly the same way you go down and you make out a will and you put in that wheel what you want done with what you have ain't gonna get there tonight but I want you to think about it where it is made us abounded toward us in all wisdom having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure we're in Heath purpose in himself that is the dispensation now if the will of God is his word that in the Indonesian of the fullness of times which is down here where we're at he might gather together in one of all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who work with all things after the Council of his own will now remember when I get back to it is a little bit more than what I'm saying but remember his will is his word so he said it he's going to bring it to pies he can't take it back right I'm glad of that I might not have a thing in the world to ever do with salvation or God or anything but I know one thing for sure he ain't gonna lie somebody can take it and believe it then I turned back around say Lord let help me help my unbelief then he goes to Revelations 13 8. now remember he's talking about how to share his own eternal life you remember his purpose was to what share his eternal life with man now he goes to Revelation 13 8 and all that dwell upon the Earth shall worship him Satan whose names are not written in the Book of Life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world dropped all the way back don't it listen but that life could not and would not be shared in any other way than through the way of God manifest In the Flesh now the only way he can give anybody life other than a creational whatever you would want to call it would he do it and he didn't do it but it's going to take God to come into the world God not a second person not a third person not even the first person because if you say the first person that convenience two or three more the prophet said he's not even the first word he said he is the person right all right God manifest in the flesh is the only way you can do it this was part of the Eternal and predestinated purpose there's you planning your purpose what was his plan and purpose to come into flesh then to redeem you and I okay this plan was to be to the praise of the glory of his grace it was the Plan of Redemption it was the Plan of Salvation now listen closely God being a savior was necessary that he predestinated man who would require salvation in order to give himself reason and purpose of being right okay anybody got any problems with it well now what I'm going to say it instead of taking what the truth of it is god brother random I'll give it to you over and over and over and over right the only way God predestinations by his foreknowledge right he doesn't predestinate my desires prison destination by his foreknowledge all right well yep brother Dale that's just not that great mystery that we we think is a great mystery in the entire my great Mysteries I miss you I missed I thought that's what the devil said I will ascend to the most high if there's anything in you and I worth anything it has been given unto us by God himself that had to die to release it but brother Dale my God can't die well I suggest you get rid of him and take the one the word speaks of that's my suggestion but listen it was necessary that he predestined made a man who would require salvation in order to give himself reason and purpose of being is that sensible enough that is 100 correct and multitudes of scripture burned out as does the very pointed verse of Romans 11 36 for him and through him and to him are all things to whom be glory forever amen there's anything all through him look man could not directly come and partake of that tree of life in the midst of the garden that eternal life of the tree had to become flesh first but before God could raise and save a sinner you had to have a sinner to raise and Save man had to fall listen the fall which would be caused by Satan had to have flesh to make fall Now read real careful and think real deep Satan had to come through the flesh also but I got this figured out Satan he must have he he Satan is an angel he is not a human being he's an angel he doesn't have any flesh he could not come into the flesh let's read a little more before God could raise and Save The Sinner he had to have one the fall which would be caused by Satan had to have flesh to make fall now okay analyzed little at the time come on the fall which would be caused by Satan had to have flesh to make fall so if it's God's plan and purpose the flesh was planning to come they went out to be flesh right now come on Satan had to come through the flesh also now how did Satan come through the flesh you couldn't create you don't have no flesh you know I know seed he couldn't plant it then Eve right see Satan had to come through flesh also how did Satan come through flesh but Satan could not come through human flesh to make the fall as would Christ come in human flesh to restore the Fallen Satan can't do that okay but that was an animal the serpent so close to man that Satan could get to the beat to that beast and through that Beast he could get to human flesh and calls to fall no problem right you're going to use the Beast right because he can't do it himself watch and inject himself thereby into the human race now what did he inject into the human race the Beast with Eve brought Cain what's he talking about but there was an animal a serpent so close into man that Satan could get to that beast and through that Beast he could get to human flesh and cause to fall and inject himself thereby into the human race watch even as Jesus would one day come and inject himself into the human race into human bodies now so the only thing Satan could do was use the Beast to pervert right come on we've been through all of it I tried to explain this a few weeks ago how is it then that Jesus would come one day and inject himself into the human race how did Jesus inject himself into the human race you want to say it I was reading that I thought I better go through this because the prophet said I don't thank the people are getting it Jesus inject himself into the human race it was not listen him as a baby being born that didn't inject him into the human race I brought a body come on how did Jesus Christ inject himself into the human race on the death Pentecost when that Holy Ghost fell he injected himself into the human race that's exactly what Satan done Satan injected himself into the human race as that devil of unbelief that you and I were born kin folks too while your Prophet said we're born between Satan and Eve and we're all a hybrid are you listening Satan injected himself into the human race not a seed he could plant he couldn't create he injected his unbelief injected that unbelief into that soul of each one of us that's why I told you God never put us in no pawn shop I'd like to hear that preach we say we're in a pawn shop we're going to be redeemed how'd you get the pawn shop God didn't put you in the pawn shop come on he can't put you in a pawn shop and redeem you out of it we put ourselves in the pawn shop right when we reach the age of accountability we accepted Satan's lives and put ourselves into the human garbage can put ourselves in the pawn shop you see come not very sensible when you think about it instead of trying to figure it out are you going to deny what he said he said the same way that Jesus injected himself into the human race was the same way that Satan injected himself in that means an entrance into our soul Satan when we were born he enters into now listen a baby when it's first born until it reaches the age of accountability that Soul has got to be created perfect not Eternal I didn't say that I said perfect God create I don't care if it's Mom and Daddy it's both perverted start to say that word I can't say okay what it is God gives life to the baby no matter how bad mama is how bad daddy is the baby is created perfect the soul of the baby the spirit of the baby even the bodies you know yourself come on we're in the human race you take a calf it's got to get to its Mama within a certain amount of hours to get that colostrum and about to pronounce that word because if it don't get that within a certain amount of hours you can do anything you want to for it it's going to die within about 14 to 21 days but if it can get that colostrum into that well it's got like four stomachs but only one of them starts working usually what I'm talking about used to I know it's got into where we're just so perverted but used to a baby was almost immune to diseases for the first six months you didn't have to worry about it but now you got to worry about it when it's first born why because of the degrading of the human race let me see that little baby when it comes into the world you look down it and you see it it's got a it's a body it's a spirit and it's a soul and that Spirit can't be perverted because it don't know how to be perverted it starts hearing a perversion when it looks up in the I mean it don't look up but it's laying there in the hospital room and they're cussing and snorting and Raising Cane it starts hearing all of that in the hospital room starts on this route to being perverted that's how Satan is injecting himself into the human race he can't create but he can pervert right now listen look what he says even as Jesus one day would come and inject himself into the human race by the new birth into human bodies put it in here not eternal life in these bodies but it's going to come to that listen a bit of a resurrection wherein we would have bodies lock into his glorified one goes all the way over to that right thus God work s it's that's what God worked out in the garden was his predestinated plan and when Satan had brought about that which was necessary to the purpose of God then man could not get to the Tree of Life In The Garden rarely not it wasn't time but an animal animal had calls to fall and did not that animal life be shed was taken in his blood shed and then give God had communion with man again even though the blood of bulls and goats then there was to come a day when God would appear what in flesh that's Jesus Christ right come on and by means of his humiliation he would restore Fallen man and making a particular of that eternal life once you see this you can understand the serpent seed and know that it was no I believe eight no it was degrading of humanity by intermingling the seed if I was you I'd go home if you wanted I'll be glad to give you this all you got to do to 102 Church age book and read it just keep reading it all that I preached for months is right there in that one reading for us to understand to come to a place to understand the Plan of Redemption it would be his predestinated plan now how does he predestinate by his foreknowledge somebody's foreknowledge in you if he put us in the garden perfect that we would fall right he knew we'd do that yes but if I had just have been back there I wouldn't have done it I remember a man talking to God one day and he looked back at him through Jesus Christ and he said you garnish the tombs you say if I'd have been back there I wouldn't have done that he said but you garnish the tombs is anything wrong keeping the tongues clean so evidently there must have been a thought involved right what was he saying to him he said if you'd been back there you'd have done the same thing that they done because you're now garnishing the tombs you're thinking they were okay um but listen God knowing the beginning the ending by his foreknowledge he could write all those names we were talking about Sunday it was a book of names you can write those names in the Lamb's Book of Life because he knows he could write in The Book of Life names and put them in take them out do whatever intersection call The Book of Life because he knows so Jacob have I loved and he saw how I hated because he knew what Jacob would do he knew what he saw would do but if we were back there we'd take up for Esau oh don't be so super religious right be sensible did anybody know Judas and who he was no everybody voting the man of the year you know that right he must have been pretty well thought of because everybody voted him treasure if you ever have any trouble it's always money no you know but think about it but God would work it out for his own Glory he is playing in his purpose to share his eternal life he predestinates by his foreknowledge God doesn't predestinate by his desires he's not willing to do any should perish I'm reading from the super sign 1963 1129 which is number two you can go ahead and put it up God doesn't predestinate by the desires how many times we read that he's not willing that any should perish we buy his foreknowledge he knew he would accept it and he would not therefore he can foretell the end from the beginning and therefore he knew that we would live in this day he knew that this would be our day he had plans for this day he had plans for every day and never had one of his plans ever failed he's always on time he's got plans for this day he's had plans for every age right by his foreknowledge he knew exactly what Martin Luther would do but you know what they had to come a date at Martin Luther and to make a choice right they finally come and told him one day and Luther don't you know the whole world's against you and he said I want you to let them know that I'm against the whole world something to that degree he's seen a revelation brother was telling Wade the other day he said I believe the key to the entire thing is for us to realize Who We Are I've been trying to preach that for 40 years to realize Who We Are and what we're here for brother Reynolds said she's not going to fall like the first Eve fail listen he's planning his purpose let's just read a couple of things down there and then we'll just have to quit but take it up Sunday ain't no problem look at number three on the notes page 34 there revelation of Jesus Christ Church age book chapter one would you like an Old Testament type let's go back to the Garden of Eden when the news came to Glory that the son Adam had been lost did God send an angel did he send a son did he send another one like unto us no he came himself to redeem that lost son Hallelujah God did not entrust his Plan of Salvation to another come on you don't think the way I do I know I'm carnal if he didn't send a son then if he descended son he couldn't trust him brother to hell well is it right right that's right he said he couldn't trust nobody else right right so he couldn't trust a son if he'd have sent him God did not entrust his Plan of Salvation to another he trusted only himself God was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and redeemed us unto himself we're saved by the blood of God the Eternal God and dwelt a mortal body in order to take away sin he became the lamb in order to shed his blood and enter into the veil within now that's taken from the church age book the revelations of Jesus Christ let's read where he's got to end the message the revelation of Jesus Christ all right the next one almost identical but this is taken from the revelation of Jesus Christ priests in 1960 1204 the morning service which brother Lee Val took and wrote this right here and what this is look what he's saying look here in the beginning when Adam I just can't get away from that seemed like somebody's not getting it somewhere look in the beginning let me show you something again the Holy Spirit warns me to do this evidently knew somebody wasn't getting it right are we getting it could that been wise like this on me to read that quote I'm just asking you a simple question the Holy Spirit warns me to do this I'm leaving my subject for a moment because even on something else when the first news come to Glory that the sun had been lost Adam God did not send an angel did he send a son I lost Adam did God send an angel did he send the son did he send anyone else he came himself to redeem his lost son Hallelujah God didn't trust it with no one but himself God was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and redeemed man himself it's we are saved the Bible said by the blood of God the moral God was the immortal God was made Mortal in order to take away sin to be the lamb himself to enter into Glory veiled and with his own blood before him Beyond the Veil now listen he couldn't trust it with somebody else he came himself but do we believe that why is everybody preaching all this about River Jordan and he wasn't God to the River Jordan and all I wanted to become God and God left him and he died a man and how can you do all of that he said well why do you bring that up so much because somebody here ain't getting it you're sympathizing with it right you want to quote from the prophet he says they sympathize with it and when you sympathize with something you're in bad shape but they're good people praise God a whole lot better people than I am but that ain't got nothing to do with it it's whether God's word is right or not um being good is good what the prophet said God came in South he said God came himself look at the next one 1960s 9 25 that day on Calvary you've read these before God had required it paragraph 56. no man was worthy no man was able no man could do it and God came himself all right and was made human and lived a human life under human desires and was crucified at Calvary and there Satan thought he wouldn't do it so he wouldn't Satan now or when Satan thought he wouldn't do it he wouldn't go through with it he went to Gethsemane and every Temptation that he may never stood he went through it just like all men but he prayed the price that blacked the Earth out like an anesthetic for an operation listen no wonder God in human flesh was dying so he's talking about nature going through a convulsion all kind of things happening no wonder why did the world go through all of the frustration the earthquakes the thing God in human flesh was dying it was the hour that the world had looked for yet many of them did not know it like it is today the many looked for these things and yet they don't recognize them they don't realize the way out they're still trying to seek pleasure in things of the world trying to find their way out listen I'll take up a point later on but let's read one more God rich in Mercy 1965. put it all the way down but get down to the bottom and let's read paragraph 105. this was to be an eternal atonement because he came in South God came himself in the storm form of sinful flesh to make a a an eternal atonement and suffered into flesh and made the atonement and returned back into form of the Holy Ghost to confirm that atonement we're no bright serpent no you know troubled waters you know what he's talking about you had to buy Serpa that was good but it wouldn't work Troubled Waters that wouldn't be no atonement it only just for the time in all pointed that perfect atonement God rich in his Mercy has done this now just for a second you have a brother David do you really believe in one God I surely do do you believe God died I believe what the prophet said about him dying amen amen but God can't die what is death take a gun blow my head off you can't kill me right you just put me in another dimension that's why it's so important to understand one true and living God Amen I've been through it with you and you know that what it brought around and said in and they're in here we'll read them Sunday if we have time he said in flesh he was a man says but in spirit he was God flexi was a man but said in Soul he was God that's two different quotes that's why I don't understand why people can't comprehend one God it just it's beyond but you you went into Oneness you don't worry about me going into Oneness you just be concerned where you at in trinitarianism yeah all right well what do you believe about God I'll give you exactly what I believe about it to the world and let them know what I believe about it because I've always preached it I believe in one thing Hebrews 10 5 a body was prepared and brought around and said by who he said the father all right he didn't provide a body for a son he provided a body for himself a body now has prepared me amen but created a body in the wound of the Virgin Mary you know started that creation of the beginning of the creation of God Amen another creation distinct from the natural created well egg and sperm placed it in the mirror in the very Mary's womb and she gave fourth birth to Emmanuel as we read in the scripture orbital trying to learn in Luke 2. born this day in the city of David as a savior which is Christ the lord right around them ask that Jew he said who will that he met will Emmanuel be like God in flesh he said yes see they're looking for a God in flesh as the Messiah why can't you look back and see what Jesus done when that baby was born from that wound or that mother the soul and the spirit of almighty God stepped into that body there was Emmanuel God With Us there wasn't the prophet said little Jehovah crying in the Cradle he said little Jehovah with no teeth that's what he explains it the Bible said it's Emmanuel God With Us when he went through his life and come to that place remember what I said the body was a creation it was not eternal you can't create eternal he could go through all of his life that was almighty God standing there talking to them Pharisees and things in the temple and his mother said your father and I wrote around and said after all of the years she had stood by he said one day she let down and said your father and I he said I must be about my father's business he said yeah but Jesus would pray don't you pray do you have God in you if you have God in you why do you pray come on is that the way you sealing it up it just oh no it's all about a lot about God that we don't know about but you see that little baby and we talk about at Christmas time the little baby laying in a Manger with almighty God or else the biggest deceiver in the world ever had he didn't become God on the River Jordan he was anointed for his ministry he was anointed with the fullness of the godhead bodily why because there was things about him he couldn't die for you and I when he was a baby he couldn't die when he was 14 to talking to the lawyers things wouldn't fulfill he didn't start his ministry he went back home with Mom and Daddy and stayed with them for a long time right but you see that's where I believe in one true and living God Amen amen but brother Dale that's just Oneness if you sit down with me and let me talk to you a long time I'll ask you a simple question let's see where you start a simple question is when does the first time in your thoughts does the Son of God come into being even your scholar says that word logos back there that created the world was the son of God that's why the man looked down in and he said didn't we throw four three men in and he says there's a four one down there and he said he'd like unto the son of God see that way I'm not a Oneness because I can follow God all the way through the Bible and bring it out to see him standing on the River Jordan body a man right but a special man everyone said no man could die like that man died he said he was almighty God in human flesh the Bible said he was a fullness of the godhead bodily he said but how could he die what died when Jesus Christ on that cross what did he say he stood into thy hands I'll come in my spirit death in the human body is a release of life that is within you blow my head off you have just released a life out of my body it will go somewhere else and be there right so when Jesus Christ hung our even brother Reynolds says God tore that soul out how much greater could you think about it he didn't want to release that come on nobody didn't want to release what was in it it's from me what's that never go ahead the body died the Soul and Spirit didn't die it was just released out of the body and that Soul was able to come back on the day of Pentecost that Spirit to anoint with that soul to give eternal life that way God could share his eternal life he is eternal life he could put it into you and I buy a new birth that's one true and living God Amen amen like I said it ain't Oneness God one this is a life's manifestation is Jesus right no I've done preach to you if you not to know the rest what I'm going to say come on he is the beginning of the creation of God we are the rest of that creation we are his offspring amen who's dwelling in your soul tonight it's either God or the devil one there ain't no in between got to be one or the other and if God is in there that's eternal life right see back there it was God With Us now is God in us think about it God's plan and purpose to share his eternal life ought to just be a savior A Healer as we keep saying it but to do what the word said that savior was going to do to do what the word says that healer is going to do one of these days he's going to heal these bodies right and they'll be eternal not to just stop death no he's going to take it right back to his purity one true and living God he had a plan and a purpose to share his eternal life we'll get to it Sunday where the Prophet says what he said Jesus gave me an inheritance he said I beg your pardon he said Jesus never gave you an inheritance don't you think about that until Sunday he never gave us an inheritance he paid the prize he paid the price he made the way see we're not one this Folk all right amen we've been down through there for 40 something years preaching on how that he started back there and worked his way down through that Christ and then become human flesh upon Earth then release that Christ again until it could come back on you and I making us little Messiahs so truly when the bride realizes who she is and what's she here for we're here to strip Satan I've ever powered he ever thought he had because the one thing he still thinks he's got is death but just remember and I love it where the Prophet said when you come up to a certain place he said God took a picture you just took a picture he said okay come on devil do all you want to I said you can't take his life until I'm through with him you can't do it go somebody's there to take care of it take on these things do you see his plan and his purpose share his life this is a many-membered body a born-again believer with the same life that their father had because it is their father's life in them that's why Paul could say it's not I that liveth but Christ that liveth in me and the life that I now live in the flesh I live what by thee faith of the son of God do we see it come on brother what is eternal life there's only one form of eternal life and that's God's own life God's own life to come into you and I make us his children we are as people and the Sheep of his pasture why can't we read those scriptures and see all of those things back there remember he could read it and see himself why can't we read it see ourselves I'll run through what David said I'll run through when they said I run through a troop and leap over a wall run around and said from natural to Supernatural he said that'll take place one day but it's not going to take place except in that little ride it's for her and her only foolish virgins doesn't make him what he wanted Angels created worship Him don't make him what he wanted The Offspring of God is what's going to make him what he wants you know I've never thought or even had any concept or thought of having children that would be perfect now I know you think yours are but that's all right I do two in my ways but I realized that when kids come into the world they're going to be kids and they're going to do funny goofy things because they're kids you know and we've done them too a lot of times a whole lot goofier come on you see the kids out there we had our bell bottom pants turtleneck sweater and ducktail haircuts flat tire we had our day they're just kids I don't look at anybody when they do something wrong like that man up there that killed all them kids and all you know what he's just lost if he could have got salvation he wouldn't want to kill nobody he's just lost you see a prostitute doing what to do they're just lost they can't they don't need to expect them to do anything else but if we say we're Christians then we're supposed to all walk like them right act like them do like them sing like them listen 539 created me a clean heart I mean let's Stand Together you have to be a Christian Within Me reasons you love him you have a name is coming let's see restore unto me but he is within me creating me and remember our experience Spirit everything oh Lord thank you the joy of thy salvation every new and spirits foreign and bless me foreign we're trying to figure it out and believe it no question God as to how and don't even start with that wild thing start to all this working it might be working right opposite tell your brother Mark we walked over this piece of property out here when the man would almost tell me off for calling me even to ask him about it come find out it was a family of state and he had three of them to deal with and that was really just telling me forget it but we just all started walking over the property we just go out there and walk around and say thank you Lord he actually heard the man that died most of you know the story pray the fact that I was going to deal with his wife I heard the man died yeah I ran home man told me right there in town that man dead did you want that property ain't you know we sure are he said I'd go call because his wife will probably sell it I run all my topic I said that man died we gonna get that property that looked good the Lord was telling me that I was going to deal with his wife he answered the phone I didn't tell him he's supposed to be dead I just talked with him just a little bit you know said well I still want to do the same thing I do every year sir he said yeah I know it I said we want to buy that property he said can't do it okay just I'll call you next year you know started hanging a photo he said wait just a minute he said what are you getting me for it now I don't price nobody's stuff he gave me a price I said we'll take it a man it had been so much so he wouldn't even talk to him on the phone shoot me out for removing a steak I said never moved removed your steak they ain't never been one out there that's my word on it sir I've been here ever since 1971. ain't never been a stake out there he said well you know he knew he couldn't deal with it because it wouldn't win there when a man that changed from that to just okay when it come time for us to pay him off he said me and my sister said you got to write three checks because me and my sister's on it and said it's an estate and that's why I couldn't deal with you about selling it he said but also my sister said for for us to knock off 500 off the price and what we agreed to I said well thank you sir see believe it we're trying to figure it out I hadn't figured out from his wife well he wasn't dead you see we can get it all figured out it won't work but just relax and let him have it right let him have it father we've just tried to make a little thoughts about you tonight Lord you know this had been on our hearts to just read that whole thing Lord for us to see it together and we've read it we read it a few weeks ago there we commented on it on the basis in the same way but yet we just seemed like something was saying
