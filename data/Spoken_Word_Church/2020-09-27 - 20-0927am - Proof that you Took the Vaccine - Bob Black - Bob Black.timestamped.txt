[3:27] nanny sister peggy lord god is there
[3:29] going to the doctor this morning we pray
[3:32] ask these things in the name of the lord
[3:33] jesus christ amen
[3:36] so this morning
[3:39] i'm going to take kind of a strange
[3:40] little topic the proof that you took the
[3:42] vaccine that's kind of a strange topic
[3:44] in these and these times what what's the
[3:46] proof that you took the vaccine
[3:49] and and uh
[3:51] you know lately i've i've been taking a
[3:53] a message that brother brown preached
[3:55] and just really kind of meditating
[3:58] very deeply on every little jot and
[4:00] tittle that brother branham said so this
[4:02] morning i want to really kind of break
[4:04] down the message he cares do you care
[4:07] and just really see what brother branham
[4:10] was trying to convey in that message and
[4:12] one of the things one of the main points
[4:14] in that message is he kind of gets
[4:16] as he kind of gets into the the topic he
[4:19] begins to talk about taking the vaccine
[4:22] and how do you know if you actually took
[4:24] it or not and those kind of things so
[4:26] let's meditate on those things this
[4:28] morning as we read first peter chapter
[4:31] five verses one to eight
[4:33] and it's really interesting that peter
[4:35] is is talking in this scripture he's
[4:37] talking to the elders he said the elders
[4:39] which are among you i exhort who am also
[4:41] an elder and a witness of the sufferings
[4:43] of christ and also a peter a partaker of
[4:46] the glory that shall be revealed
[4:49] feed the flock of god which is among you
[4:51] taking the oversight thereof
[4:54] not by constraint
[4:56] but willingly
[4:58] not for filthy lucr
[5:00] but of a reading mind
[5:02] neither is being lords over god's
[5:04] heritage but being in samples to the
[5:07] flock
[5:08] but to live a life in front of people so
[5:10] that you can influence them
[5:13] and when the chief shepherd shall appear
[5:15] ye shall receive a crown of glory that
[5:17] fadeth not away
[5:19] likewise younger submit yourselves unto
[5:21] the elder yea all of you be subject one
[5:24] to another and be clothed with humility
[5:27] for god resisteth the proud and giveth
[5:30] grace to the humble
[5:31] now i got that in bold there because i
[5:33] think that is such a critical scripture
[5:36] because it's so easy to begin to get
[5:38] lifted up within yourself
[5:41] ministers laity people begin to get so
[5:43] puffed up within themselves and they
[5:45] until they re won't listen to correction
[5:48] god resisted the proud and giveth grace
[5:51] to the humble
[5:53] humble yourselves therefore under the
[5:54] mighty hand of god
[5:56] that he may exalt you in due time
[5:59] because we want him to do the exalting
[6:00] not ourselves
[6:02] not for ourselves to be to put ourselves
[6:04] at the chief placed at the feast but to
[6:06] be invited to come and sit at the chief
[6:09] place
[6:11] now here's the here's the main point of
[6:13] this morning's message
[6:15] casting all your care upon him
[6:19] for he careth for you you may be seated
[6:21] the lord adds a blessing to the reading
[6:22] of the word
[6:25] now
[6:26] i want to kind of start this message
[6:28] this morning on with a with a very
[6:30] strange quote
[6:32] we're going to talk about martin luther
[6:33] king
[6:34] because brother branham started this
[6:36] message he cares do you care with with
[6:39] talking about why he believed
[6:42] that martin luther king was approaching
[6:44] things the wrong way
[6:46] and he said
[6:47] if we pull up that first quote he said
[6:48] no i was just talking about martin
[6:50] luther king on this great disaster that
[6:51] they're having in the south
[6:55] with the colored people i said if those
[6:57] people were slaves i'd take my church
[6:59] and go south to help them people out of
[7:00] slavery in other words he he does he
[7:03] wanted he would want to help people out
[7:04] of slavery
[7:06] now now just kind of set in your mind as
[7:08] i read these quotes the point that i'm
[7:11] trying to make
[7:12] is that the gospel is the power of
[7:14] salvation to change lives
[7:17] the gospel is the power of salvation to
[7:19] change lives and brother branham was
[7:20] looking at this situation of all of this
[7:22] conflict being stirred up and people
[7:24] rioting and things kind of similar to
[7:26] what's going on today
[7:28] and and he said he said it's inspired of
[7:30] the wrong thing you see they them people
[7:32] and that's the reason i say that not
[7:34] that there is any prophecy concerning it
[7:37] i have nothing on it from the lord and
[7:39] see this is that that that that sermon
[7:41] where he says it's just my opinion that
[7:44] he's going to lead them into a slaughter
[7:45] and all that kind of thing and if i say
[7:47] anything from the lord like that to tell
[7:49] you it's always i'm speaking now but
[7:50] when he speaks i say it's not me it's
[7:52] thus saith the lord
[7:54] and i can't say it until he tells me
[7:56] i could be altogether wrong in my
[7:58] thought about martin luther king
[8:00] i don't know i can say that's just my
[8:02] opinion
[8:03] anything that rises up trouble that's
[8:05] what's supposed to be in the last days
[8:08] now let me stop right here on that on
[8:10] that on what he just said about that's
[8:12] just my opinion because i was talking to
[8:14] somebody the other day and they were
[8:15] talking about how that a lot of things
[8:17] that brother branham says is his opinion
[8:19] well you know you got to be careful
[8:21] about that because you can think that
[8:23] he's saying something of himself and
[8:25] you'll you'll just kind of run off with
[8:27] you will ignore something that could
[8:29] help you something that's actually part
[8:31] of the word part of the word that he's
[8:32] trying to manifest through the preaching
[8:34] of the word so you have to wait
[8:36] you have to trust him to tell you
[8:38] whether or not he's his opinion or not
[8:40] if you just if you just cherry pick and
[8:41] say well i think that's his opinion you
[8:43] could be headed down the wrong path
[8:45] you've got to be very careful about that
[8:47] now now we believe that god sent a
[8:49] prophet and so we're relying on the the
[8:51] prophet's words i i was listening to
[8:54] that sermon that andrew glover preached
[8:56] here the last last night and and he was
[8:58] talking about how when he started
[8:59] preaching he thought that everybody if
[9:01] you just quote the prophet that
[9:02] everybody would agree with you and say
[9:04] yes and now they're head but it turns
[9:05] out that that's not true because a lot
[9:07] of people have trouble just opening up
[9:09] their heart they have a problem
[9:10] recognizing what's taking place in this
[9:13] day that this was not just a message
[9:14] from
[9:15] that a man came up with or or something
[9:18] like that this is this was a message
[9:19] straight from the throne of god straight
[9:22] to your heart straight from the deep
[9:25] the deep calling to the deep from god's
[9:27] soul to your soul
[9:29] if you could just recognize it that that
[9:31] when
[9:32] unless brother branham says that it's
[9:34] his opinion take it at face value and
[9:36] just hang on to it and meditate on it
[9:38] until god reveals to you
[9:40] the true nature of the thing
[9:42] he said i don't know i can't say that's
[9:44] just my opinion anything that rises up
[9:46] trouble that's what's supposed to be in
[9:48] the last days and it's all inspired of
[9:50] satan to break up our commonwealth and
[9:52] whatever we have anything that rises up
[9:54] like that so i'm for those people down
[9:56] there don't you never think that i'm not
[9:59] let me read that again i'm for those
[10:00] people down there don't you never think
[10:02] i'm not i'm for freedom and for
[10:04] everything but the people doesn't have
[10:05] that situation under now
[10:07] now now all of these kind of quotes and
[10:09] things that can be very confusing to
[10:11] somebody that's that's meditating and
[10:13] thinking about aligning themselves with
[10:15] the political arena of the day and and
[10:17] and just the
[10:19] the way that people in the world want
[10:21] you to think
[10:22] but but align your the reason why he
[10:24] called these things out is to align
[10:26] yourselves with the gospel and in the
[10:28] message the third exodus i had it on my
[10:30] phone but i guess i left it in my office
[10:32] so i wrote down also here so hopefully
[10:34] lord willing i could read my handwriting
[10:36] he said them people
[10:38] if they got a hard
[10:40] uh a hard heart
[10:42] he's talking about the people in the
[10:43] south yes i'm struggling reading my hand
[10:46] right they're all laughing
[10:47] if they got a hard heart and don't know
[10:49] these things
[10:51] you can't drive into a people's
[10:53] spiritual things
[10:55] what is beat in there with political
[10:57] powers
[10:58] they've got to accept it
[11:00] be born again
[11:01] then they'll see these things
[11:04] so the point that he's trying to make
[11:06] amongst all these comments is that you
[11:09] can't change the world by forcing people
[11:11] you can't change the world by by trying
[11:13] to beat them into letting you come into
[11:15] their schools into their programs you
[11:17] can't change the world but what you can
[11:19] do the the thing that will change the
[11:21] world is the gospel of jesus christ that
[11:24] born-again experience
[11:26] now now that's the thing that i i
[11:28] perceive that that many people
[11:30] let me be bold and say even here in this
[11:32] church struggle to understand the
[11:34] importance of being born again
[11:37] because being born again will actually
[11:39] change your heart it can change your
[11:41] heart to where a black man and a white
[11:43] man will love one another and can sit at
[11:45] the table and fellowship with one
[11:46] another it can change the heart to wear
[11:48] an old pharisee and a sadducee you can
[11:50] sit down with with somebody and one
[11:53] another and sit together in harmony and
[11:56] love it can change it can change your
[11:58] heart and see we're not trying to change
[12:00] our hearts by being good people we're
[12:02] not we're not trying to come to church
[12:04] to just be good and good citizens and
[12:06] everything but we're trying we're trying
[12:08] to we're trying to be born again because
[12:11] when the holy ghost comes and quickens
[12:13] the word that you've held it will change
[12:15] your life
[12:17] you see laodiceans are more concerned
[12:19] about their rights being infringed
[12:21] laodiceans are more concerned about
[12:23] their feelings being hurt
[12:25] or or what is in the constitution do you
[12:27] realize how many times the cost of the
[12:28] constitution has been amended uh been
[12:31] rewritten things taken out and put back
[12:33] in called amendments the constitution
[12:36] has been constantly changing since the
[12:37] founding fathers wrote it but i tell you
[12:39] one thing that hasn't changed is the
[12:41] word of god the word of god is eternal
[12:44] it's been it's been the same it's been
[12:46] unchanging it never changes nothing will
[12:48] ever be added nothing will ever be
[12:50] removed because it is consistent it is
[12:53] reliable if you can just let go and
[12:55] accept the word of god then you too can
[12:58] be part of that unchanging word
[13:01] but you see that's that's our problem
[13:04] brother brown said he said and now
[13:05] listen to this quote he said this united
[13:07] states he began to talk about how the
[13:09] government had was trying to make him
[13:11] make him pay all those overdue taxes and
[13:13] things that they said he owed he said
[13:15] this government now tells me that i
[13:17] can't even sign a check
[13:19] that's given to me personally
[13:21] see that's constitutional rights taken
[13:24] from me but what can i do about it
[13:26] just go ahead that's all now i wonder
[13:30] sitting here today let's meditate on
[13:31] this and and examine yourself how many
[13:34] of our lives and our thoughts is this
[13:37] quote contrary to
[13:38] because we think many times that we
[13:41] should get all riled up about somebody
[13:43] violating our constitutional rights or
[13:45] somebody forcing us to do something that
[13:47] we don't think we should be we should be
[13:49] able to do
[13:50] but he said
[13:52] just go ahead that's all see
[13:54] and it has to go through another system
[13:56] before i as a citizen of the united
[13:57] states can cash a check has to come
[14:00] through this church i can't cash it see
[14:02] and that's not right that's
[14:04] unconstitutional
[14:05] but what can i do about it there's
[14:08] nothing this tax collector down here is
[14:10] the one told me i couldn't do it so well
[14:12] there it is if it is whatever so just
[14:15] let it go
[14:17] now he's not saying something that
[14:18] they're trying to force him to do
[14:19] something contrary to the word you see
[14:22] but he's talking about the little little
[14:24] things like paying paying
[14:26] overdue taxes taking paying taxes that
[14:28] they want him to do forcing him to do
[14:29] things like that he's saying just let it
[14:32] go
[14:33] you see what real christian love real
[14:35] christian love is not riling up and
[14:37] getting all a temper tantrum and telling
[14:39] somebody well i've gotta you can't talk
[14:41] to me like that but real christian love
[14:43] is is wanting peace and wanting wanting
[14:46] to be in one accord with one another and
[14:48] and standing for something that's real
[14:50] and true not something that's fake
[14:53] you see the reason why brother brown
[14:55] kept hitting on the things that martin
[14:56] luther king was doing was because he was
[14:58] trying to rile up people for something
[15:00] through political force
[15:02] force something into being instead of
[15:05] trusting in the power of the gospel of
[15:07] the spoken word
[15:08] because the power the power there is
[15:11] power in the gospel
[15:13] there is power in the gospel
[15:16] but you got to believe it
[15:18] so as brother branham began to begin to
[15:20] talk about in this sermon he cares do
[15:22] you care he he began to talk about you
[15:25] know how much we are needy people and
[15:27] how you know even this morning sitting
[15:29] in this church there's many people that
[15:30] are needing different things everybody
[15:32] has a special need and some are needing
[15:35] salvation some are needing the new birth
[15:37] many realize that they need a new birth
[15:39] many don't realize they needed a new
[15:41] birth maybe this morning i couldn't
[15:43] maybe the veil from your eyes can be
[15:45] lifted up to realize to cause you if you
[15:47] don't realize that you need to be born
[15:49] again to open your eyes to the
[15:51] understanding that there's something
[15:52] wrong in your life and that you need god
[15:55] maybe this morning there's many people
[15:57] seeking healing and their their trouble
[15:59] in deflation i i know there are many
[16:00] people seeking healing
[16:02] a brother i was texting with a brother
[16:04] last night and he began to tell me all
[16:05] the ones that are suffering from from
[16:07] sickness from coronavirus all around and
[16:09] some are in the hospital and different
[16:10] kind of things and you see people are
[16:12] needy and god made us that way so that
[16:15] we would rely on god and not upon our
[16:17] own selves and so as brother branham was
[16:19] ministering this message he's trying to
[16:21] get a point across that god cares
[16:24] because you see you get so close to your
[16:26] sickness and to your job troubles into
[16:27] all these things and you begin to forget
[16:30] that you begin to think that god wants
[16:32] you to be uncomfortable
[16:34] and the message uh we were listening to
[16:36] in the car this morning i forget the
[16:38] title but it was one of these about god
[16:40] care he began to he began to preach
[16:42] about how that
[16:43] god does not want you to be
[16:45] uncomfortable and he began to relate how
[16:47] if a if a mother is is ministering to
[16:50] her a little sick child and rubbing his
[16:52] head and everything in the middle of the
[16:53] night she might be doing that sick
[16:55] herself and and that's how god is he's
[16:57] he's he's he doesn't want you to be sick
[17:00] he doesn't want you to be uncomfortable
[17:02] he wants you to be able to live a
[17:03] prosperous life so that
[17:05] you're so that you're whole in your body
[17:07] so that you can serve him with all of
[17:08] your faculties and many times we begin
[17:10] to realize we begin to get in our head
[17:12] that god wants me to be sick he wants me
[17:14] to suffer he wants me to go all these
[17:16] things suffering can can cause you to
[17:18] can build character and and suffering
[17:21] can can can help you as part of your
[17:23] journey but god doesn't want you to stay
[17:26] in a state of suffering many times
[17:28] suffering suffering the point of it is
[17:30] to bring you closer to god so that you
[17:32] realize that you need him but god
[17:34] doesn't want you to suffer and he
[17:36] doesn't want you to be sick
[17:39] so so don't wonder this morning if god
[17:42] still cares about you because he does
[17:44] care listen he cares for the old old
[17:46] people he cares for young people he
[17:48] cares for the young people that might be
[17:49] living in an old broken home where the
[17:51] mama's over here and daddy's over there
[17:53] and you don't know who your real daddy
[17:54] is or whatever but he still cares for
[17:56] you brother brown said he he cares if if
[17:59] you despite all of your failures and all
[18:02] the times that you've tried and failed
[18:05] he still cares for you you think about a
[18:07] god like that that despite
[18:10] all of your failings and all of your
[18:12] shortcomings and all the times that you
[18:14] messed up and all the times that you
[18:16] made a mistake but yet god is still on
[18:18] the scene and he still cares for you he
[18:21] still ca and you know what he's he sent
[18:23] his holy spirit into the church to prove
[18:25] that he cares that's why he's here this
[18:27] morning that's why the angels are lining
[18:29] the wall to show to you that he still
[18:32] cares that he wants you to just give in
[18:34] and open the door of your heart so that
[18:35] he can come in
[18:37] he said now brother branham when he was
[18:38] preaching this message he was preaching
[18:40] it in preparation for a prayer line so
[18:42] the people were already in expectation
[18:45] to come forward and go through the
[18:47] prayer line and receive what they were
[18:49] seeking
[18:50] now this morning in this church we're
[18:52] not we're not in preparation for a
[18:54] prayer line but yet you can still
[18:55] receive whatever you have need of if you
[18:58] will just follow the recipe that brother
[19:00] branham outlined as he was preaching
[19:02] this message
[19:04] you don't have to you can be like
[19:05] cornelius and just say lord just just
[19:07] speak the word you don't have to go
[19:08] through a prayer line you don't have to
[19:10] have somebody lay hands on you you can
[19:12] just
[19:16] well let me stay on track i was about to
[19:17] go off track here listen brother braham
[19:19] said you if you do not have faith
[19:22] then there's no need of even coming to
[19:24] be prayed for because it's going to take
[19:26] your faith
[19:28] and my faith together
[19:29] my faith to believe him your faith to
[19:32] believe him amen now now let's think
[19:34] about that now
[19:36] if god cares and you care that's lining
[19:39] up the word together that's lining up
[19:41] something in harmony if i believe and
[19:44] you believe i believe the word that i'm
[19:46] preaching and you believe the word that
[19:47] i'm preaching i believe it and i can
[19:49] back it up by scripture i believe and
[19:51] i'm showing you what the gospel says and
[19:53] you sit there and you believe and you
[19:55] we're now we're in harmony now something
[19:58] has got to happen if two or three agree
[20:01] concerning anything it's got to happen
[20:03] that is the scripture that is the word
[20:05] if i believe and you believe then
[20:07] something's got to happen if you get two
[20:09] people together and they believe on the
[20:11] word something's got to happen if you if
[20:13] you're but you've got to believe you've
[20:15] got to have faith how can you expect
[20:18] anything to happen without faith and so
[20:20] we're going to examine it in this
[20:21] message this morning
[20:23] what goes into having faith
[20:25] there's a recipe that brother branham
[20:27] outlines exactly what you need to do to
[20:29] have to so that your heart can soften up
[20:32] exactly your approach to the what to the
[20:34] gospel your approach to the word so that
[20:36] you can look at it with the right frame
[20:37] of mind so that something will spark and
[20:40] something will happen
[20:42] he said so we don't forget this now as
[20:44] uh go along we've got to have something
[20:46] evidently
[20:48] with evidence
[20:49] i mean that we can base our faith upon
[20:52] what we're trying to do
[20:54] because if a man approaches anything
[20:56] that he wants to do
[20:58] without sufficient faith
[21:00] he's bound to be a failure
[21:02] but if he can approach it with
[21:03] sufficient faith then he's bound to
[21:06] succeed if it is according to god's will
[21:09] and purpose to do it
[21:10] now think about a promise like that that
[21:12] if you come with faith it is bound to
[21:15] succeed you are bound to succeed you are
[21:18] bound to succeed just like that little
[21:20] woman that said if i can but touch the
[21:22] hem of his garment that i will be made
[21:24] whole and she came with the right
[21:26] approach the right sincerity the the
[21:28] right the right everything and she
[21:30] believed the word because matthew
[21:32] chapter 9 verse 20 says and behold a
[21:34] woman which was diseased with an issue
[21:36] of blood twelve years came behind him
[21:38] and touched the hem of his garment for
[21:40] she said within herself if i may but
[21:43] touch his garment i may i shall behold
[21:46] now she doesn't come with books and
[21:48] books of theology and all this kind of
[21:50] stuff she didn't come with a minister
[21:52] drag behind her but she came with her
[21:54] own pure simple faith believing that if
[21:56] she could just reach out and touch the
[21:58] hem of his garment she will be made
[22:00] whole you know that's how you approach
[22:02] god for every promise of god written in
[22:04] his word whether it's the holy ghost
[22:06] whether it's healing whether it's the
[22:07] salvation of your children you approach
[22:10] god with that same simple faith that
[22:12] that little woman reached out and
[22:13] touched the hem of his garment if i can
[22:15] just touch the hem of his garment that's
[22:17] all she said she didn't say if i can
[22:19] have a big long conversation with him if
[22:20] i can get all worked in a motion but if
[22:23] i can just touch the hem of his garment
[22:25] so you see that's our problem we begin
[22:27] to say it's not for me it won't work it
[22:30] won't work it's not effective
[22:33] me and zach were talking about one of
[22:34] his friends in the message the other day
[22:36] about how that's exactly the words that
[22:38] he would relate i've tried it and it
[22:39] won't work i keep trying to be delivered
[22:41] and it won't work i go back and it's
[22:43] like i go around in circles but i wonder
[22:46] i want to ask you this morning if you're
[22:47] going around and around in circles and
[22:49] it doesn't seem to be effective have you
[22:51] accepted it the way that brother branham
[22:53] said to accept it have you received the
[22:56] prescription have you taken the
[22:57] vaccination the way that it's supposed
[23:00] to be taken have you believed it with
[23:02] all of your heart have you received it
[23:04] with a with the open door
[23:07] you see this mess this medicine is not
[23:09] to be haphazardly chugged with a glass
[23:11] of water like some some appeal that you
[23:13] got in your cabinet this medicine is to
[23:16] be taken with sincerity with an honest
[23:19] and a contrite heart coming into church
[23:21] not laughing and joking all those kind
[23:23] of things but this medicine has got to
[23:25] be received the right way
[23:29] first you've got to believe that he
[23:30] cares
[23:32] listen brother branham
[23:34] he began to expound all these different
[23:36] these different stories of how that to
[23:38] show that god cares
[23:40] now see see right now right now i'm
[23:42] preaching about how much god cares and
[23:44] if you're asleep in this church i wonder
[23:46] how much you care
[23:48] i wonder if your eyes are beginning to
[23:50] slumber i i wonder if the gospel could
[23:52] wake you up right now to the revelation
[23:54] that god cares for you that god cares
[23:57] whether or not you care or not god still
[23:59] cares for you even if you don't care god
[24:02] still cares god cares enough to die for
[24:05] you on the cross even if you're
[24:06] slumbering even if you're asleep even if
[24:08] you look with half eyes that you don't
[24:10] care right now god still cares for you
[24:15] brother brown said he he said he was
[24:17] talking about this this minister a
[24:19] leader that had been bound by a complex
[24:21] and he said he went there and seen this
[24:23] handsome young man sitting there just in
[24:25] the peak of his life
[24:26] a leader of young men sitting there and
[24:28] sitting bound him
[24:30] he said he never noticed but i took my
[24:32] hand to shake hands with his hand to see
[24:34] if some disease had plagued him but
[24:36] there was no sign of vibration coming
[24:37] right out of the room from praying and
[24:39] fasting and waiting upon the lord the
[24:41] anointing of the holy spirit was there
[24:43] and that's why i let us see and then
[24:45] seeing the shadow of darkness over him i
[24:48] never said what i was doing but in less
[24:49] than a couple of moments time it was all
[24:51] gone the coldness of his hands left he
[24:54] was shouting and praising god a few
[24:55] minutes to find himself and here they
[24:57] sit here right this morning sitting
[24:59] sitting in the audience see how satan
[25:02] was trying to upset that young man by
[25:04] referring to him of some complex to be
[25:07] built back which the holy spirit knew
[25:10] but god cared for that man god cared for
[25:13] that young boy
[25:14] do you real i wonder how many of us
[25:16] sitting here in this audience this
[25:18] morning would care for a minister that
[25:19] had been backslidden would care for
[25:21] somebody that's supposed to be a leader
[25:23] that had gotten way late and uh tossed
[25:26] to the side and the devil had got all
[25:27] trapped up but you see even when we
[25:29] don't care for somebody god still cares
[25:32] that's how much god still loves us
[25:35] even when we're unlovable god still
[25:37] loves us
[25:38] brother brown began to talk about this
[25:40] sister that had been searching for
[25:41] deliverance for nine years and then when
[25:43] she finally met somebody that could tell
[25:45] her the truth she realized that god
[25:48] still cared for her
[25:49] and she said brother bran i'm just a
[25:51] word with you standing there a vision
[25:53] broke over this fine looking young woman
[25:55] and see that her heart was burdened and
[25:57] she was trying to work to make a living
[25:59] and a great thing happened way back in
[26:01] the time of her parents that had caused
[26:02] this great thing to happen to her and
[26:04] the lord jesus revealed it and showed
[26:06] what it was and there in a moment's time
[26:09] took it from the woman
[26:11] she went around rejoicing and now
[26:13] sitting here in the audience with us now
[26:15] rejoicing with tears as she's wiping her
[26:18] eyes now
[26:20] knowing that the truth of the thing was
[26:21] made known do you realize why she was
[26:24] delivered she began to get a an
[26:26] understanding that god cared about her
[26:30] that life was not some meaningless
[26:32] existence that you walk through and just
[26:34] go from your birth to your death and
[26:36] there's no purpose in life but god has a
[26:38] purpose for you god wants you to be
[26:40] happy god wants you to be comfortable
[26:42] god wants you to be healthy and wealthy
[26:44] and what well maybe not wealthy but
[26:47] god wants you to be god wants you to be
[26:49] what he his plan for you is
[26:55] you see when he was when he was on earth
[26:58] he cared for the people so much to until
[27:00] he healed their sick he comforted their
[27:03] hearts he told them about a place where
[27:04] he would go and prepare for them and
[27:06] would come again to receive them unto
[27:07] him himself and when he left he said
[27:10] i'll not leave you comfortless but i
[27:13] will send the holy spirit and he shall
[27:15] continue my care for you until he
[27:17] returns
[27:18] i will not leave you comfortless i will
[27:20] come to you he said his body brother
[27:22] brahms he explained it like this he said
[27:24] his body
[27:26] as a high priest and a mediatorial work
[27:28] that he's doing now that body must be in
[27:31] the presence of god at all times for
[27:34] intercession that god cannot see the
[27:36] sinner's sin he sees only the blood of
[27:39] his own son
[27:41] when you recognize that
[27:43] when you accept that you are taking the
[27:46] vaccine and the vaccination gives you a
[27:49] comfort to know that god is not looking
[27:52] at your mistakes when you come to god
[27:54] and ask for forgiveness and confess your
[27:56] sins god no more sees your mistakes and
[27:58] your problems in your iniquity but it's
[28:00] under the into the sea of god's
[28:02] forgiveless it's under the blood and
[28:04] he's looking at your mistakes and your
[28:06] sins through that shed blood
[28:08] i what what kind of a comfort that
[28:10] should give to the church this morning
[28:11] to know that god is not looking at your
[28:13] mistakes in your faults and failures but
[28:16] he's looking at you through the
[28:17] sacrifice the atoning blood that he
[28:19] already made he's looking at you through
[28:21] what he's already done and not what you
[28:23] are doing
[28:25] you see
[28:26] he cared on earth as he healed people
[28:28] and all those things but he sent his
[28:30] spirit back into the church to continue
[28:32] that care he was to continue to care for
[28:34] the people his people here on earth in
[28:37] the same manner that he cared for them
[28:39] when he was here because john 15 says
[28:42] when the comforter has come who i will
[28:44] send unto you from the father even the
[28:46] spirit of truth which proceedeth from
[28:48] the father he shall testify of me
[28:50] and brother brown said in other words
[28:52] he will do the same thing he did
[28:56] the holy spirit working through a
[28:58] tabernacle that he had sanctified
[29:01] would do the same thing he did
[29:04] you talk about a comfort now
[29:06] now this should elevate our faith
[29:08] because if he healed the sick when he
[29:10] was on earth at that same comforter as
[29:13] in you
[29:14] you can trust that same comforter for
[29:16] that same healing that he gave back then
[29:19] if you need the holy ghost that same
[29:21] comforter is here right now to give it
[29:23] to you if you you don't have to wait
[29:25] it's not some far-off thing that we push
[29:27] we push way off in the future it's here
[29:30] ready right now for you to receive it in
[29:32] the building waiting on you standing by
[29:37] now what that ought to do for us then we
[29:40] know that right among us today we have
[29:41] the same comforting lord jesus in the
[29:43] form of the holy ghost
[29:45] another office that god himself was
[29:47] working in
[29:49] he was a comforter when they could look
[29:50] up and see the pillar of fire and hear
[29:52] the prophets speak the words that was
[29:54] true and vindicated do you know what
[29:56] vindicate means it means when the words
[29:58] are spoken and god brings it to pass
[30:00] when when god said when moses said we're
[30:03] going out god proved it that they by
[30:05] part of the red sea when when god told
[30:07] moses what i'm going to provide for you
[30:09] he proved it he vindicated it by
[30:11] providing for them he gave them water
[30:12] from the rock he gave them food he gave
[30:14] them man in the wilderness he
[30:16] took care of them he pre-vindicated it
[30:19] by proving that he was with him and he's
[30:21] proving that he's with you in this hour
[30:23] right now he's proving that he's here by
[30:25] the holy ghost he was a comforter when
[30:27] he's here on earth as a man god made
[30:29] flesh you promise the works that i do
[30:31] shall you do also and i am going to the
[30:34] father and going to send back the holy
[30:35] spirit which will be in me in spirit
[30:37] form and i'll be with you and dwell in
[30:39] you and the very same things that i've
[30:41] done here the holy spirit will do again
[30:43] in my name when he comes and that's why
[30:45] i believe that signs and wonders will
[30:47] follow them that believe because the
[30:48] comforter is still here he hasn't left
[30:50] us high and dry he still cares for us he
[30:53] still cares for his church
[30:56] brother brown said how would you know
[30:59] because we see god manifested in flesh
[31:01] how do you know that you've took the
[31:04] vaccination
[31:05] how do you know that you've accepted the
[31:07] word for your day
[31:09] how do you know that you're in a church
[31:11] a holy ghost field church that has
[31:12] accepted the vast vaccination because
[31:15] you can see god manifested in flesh
[31:20] brother brown said he would do it in the
[31:21] same way
[31:22] he would do it in the same way so that
[31:24] we would know
[31:26] so that we would know
[31:28] whether it was a comfort from some
[31:29] earthly standpoint is the comfort you
[31:32] have because somebody some somebody gave
[31:34] you some some sweet tea and invited you
[31:36] over for some biscuits in the morning or
[31:38] whatever invited you over for some steak
[31:40] in the evening or whatever is it that
[31:42] could that's not the kind of comfort
[31:43] that we have now listen i'm saying the
[31:46] same words i'm actually reading the
[31:47] quote from brother branham so don't get
[31:50] all tired and half-eyed on me now these
[31:51] are the these are the words of the
[31:53] prophet
[31:54] i wish i could run around and ride a
[31:56] unicycle or something if it will keep
[31:57] your keep you awake do some juggling or
[31:59] something
[32:01] you know just
[32:02] you know brother brown said that
[32:03] christians are entertained by the word
[32:05] we want we want some many times we want
[32:06] to come to church to see the minister
[32:08] entertain us and run around and do
[32:10] tricks and everything but a real
[32:11] christian is entertained by the word
[32:15] i i told you i wasn't going to do that
[32:17] brother by the way but i did it
[32:23] hey brother brown said he would do it in
[32:25] the same way so that we would know so
[32:27] that we would have confidence
[32:30] whether it was a comfort from some
[32:31] earthly standpoint whether we know it
[32:33] was a comfort from some elderly person
[32:35] how about that some elderly person who
[32:38] could put their arms around us and hug
[32:39] us a little and make us feel good or
[32:41] some theological term of a denomination
[32:44] that would say now you belong to us and
[32:45] we got it i don't belong to the rest of
[32:47] them because they haven't
[32:49] he made this directly sure see
[32:52] he will speak in my name
[32:55] the works that i do will you do also
[32:58] when he's upon you
[32:59] he would comfort in the same way
[33:02] by forgiving all of our sins
[33:05] by healing all of our sickness and
[33:08] speaking to us of a comfort of a kingdom
[33:11] that is to come
[33:14] in first timothy 3 16 it's written this
[33:16] way know about god without controversy
[33:18] we realize that great is the mystery of
[33:21] godliness for god was manifested in the
[33:24] flesh we saw god in flesh
[33:26] we see we are seeing god in flesh
[33:30] that was god's comfort to know that he
[33:32] comes so much
[33:34] he cared for us
[33:37] until he became one of us
[33:39] god manifested in the flesh not just
[33:42] another person
[33:43] but god himself
[33:46] now brother branham said in in all the
[33:47] different sermons that i've i've
[33:49] listened to along this line he said now
[33:51] he
[33:52] you know you think brother brown's not
[33:54] preaching from notes but he followed the
[33:56] same pattern and these sermons
[33:58] that's a comfort to me because you know
[34:00] a lot of times people say why are you
[34:01] preaching from notes bro well brother
[34:03] brown brother branham followed this
[34:04] pattern as he was preaching these things
[34:06] and he said now everybody doesn't have
[34:08] this comforter
[34:09] and he said so the reason they don't
[34:11] have it
[34:12] is because they don't accept it
[34:15] it's for them but they don't accept do
[34:17] you realize when you get a correct
[34:19] understanding of predestination that god
[34:21] is not pushing you through a tube
[34:24] that's that's the way so many of us used
[34:25] to believe back in the day and may i
[34:28] hope i hope you don't believe that now
[34:29] that
[34:30] it hinders our ability to witness when
[34:32] you say well if they're going to come to
[34:34] it they're just going to come to it
[34:36] somewhere along the line some
[34:38] something's going to happen it hinders
[34:39] your ability to respond correctly to the
[34:41] gospel if you don't understand
[34:43] predestination correctly
[34:45] god predestinates you by for knowledge
[34:47] no he's looking right now at your choice
[34:50] he looked before the foundation of the
[34:52] world what your choice would be how you
[34:54] would respond whether you would accept
[34:55] it or not and so he had it waiting for
[34:58] you if he knew that you would accept it
[35:00] do you real we were talking about that
[35:02] the other day in our home do you realize
[35:04] that the the the grace that god has
[35:06] given that he looked down from from eons
[35:08] eons back and knew that you would accept
[35:11] it and therefore could bring this one to
[35:14] the and this one together all the way
[35:16] down this one mayor and this and we're
[35:18] we were talking about zach has romanian
[35:20] ancestors
[35:21] and you think about all those wars and
[35:23] things vlad sheppas the the military
[35:25] leader that inspired count dracula
[35:27] everything that would put people on
[35:28] stakes and all those you could look
[35:30] across the hillside and see people just
[35:33] on
[35:33] skewered on stakes because of when he
[35:36] won a war everybody got skewered
[35:37] hundreds of thousands of people and
[35:39] think about all those wars that god
[35:41] brought a line right through because he
[35:43] knew that one day zach would be sitting
[35:46] in this church and i'm not just speaking
[35:47] on zach because he's my on my son i'm
[35:49] speaking on everybody everybody here
[35:51] that would believe the gospel god knew
[35:53] before the foundation of the world that
[35:54] you would accept it and he made a way
[35:56] for you to accept it because he knew
[35:58] that you would accept it he knew you
[36:00] would receive it you talk about grace
[36:02] you talk about a comfort to be able to
[36:04] recognize how much god cared for you
[36:06] that he died on the cross for you and
[36:08] made a way for you and sent a prophet
[36:10] for you and vindicated it and showed the
[36:12] sign in heaven all these things so that
[36:15] you would you would have you would be
[36:16] confident and you would know that god
[36:19] cared for you
[36:21] brother braham said if you don't accept
[36:23] god's comforter you have to find some
[36:24] other comforter
[36:27] because you can't live without something
[36:29] to live for
[36:31] man one message brother brown was
[36:32] talking about you see the problem is
[36:34] that you got a little spot in your heart
[36:38] that's got to be filled right
[36:40] and it was filled in in the garden of
[36:42] eden it was filled by god and then aft
[36:44] when sin entered the picture from from
[36:46] abel on down to john the baptist it was
[36:49] empty because they were looking and
[36:51] waiting for something they were waiting
[36:52] for something to feel that thing and you
[36:54] see down through the ages if you don't
[36:56] feel that thing with god you'll have to
[36:58] feel it with something
[37:00] and brother branham said i wrote down
[37:02] some things that he said that people
[37:03] feel it with he said people will think
[37:06] that their their children they'll
[37:08] they'll think that they want their
[37:09] children to go to a nice ballet program
[37:12] or something they'll
[37:13] because the parents want their kids to
[37:15] be in ballet or something or baseball or
[37:17] whatever it might be get them in some
[37:19] kind of program and that detract takes
[37:21] them away from the word of god and get
[37:23] them in the ballet or something that
[37:25] that gets he said what it is is putting
[37:27] strict nine in them
[37:29] strict nine in them to fill that thing
[37:32] that spot in their heart with something
[37:34] else
[37:36] he said there was this lady
[37:38] in the service one of his services that
[37:40] she said
[37:41] talking about recognizing that god cares
[37:43] he said she was sitting back there and
[37:45] and her baby began to cry and she wasn't
[37:47] even a believer but he she took that
[37:49] baby out of the out of the congregation
[37:51] and
[37:52] and he said he said
[37:54] after the service he was walking by and
[37:56] she said i wish i could have heard the
[37:57] rest of that service i wish i could have
[37:59] heard it and he said
[38:01] he said well hey this is the providence
[38:03] of god and began to talk to her about
[38:05] the lord and before long she was crying
[38:07] and weeping and he said he said you
[38:08] realize what what took place was that
[38:10] woman cared she wanted somebody else to
[38:12] be able to listen to that service and
[38:14] she didn't want to hinder the service by
[38:16] that baby crying and she cared enough to
[38:18] take that baby out and because she cared
[38:22] god cared for her
[38:26] you see if you if you don't if you don't
[38:27] feel that spot up something else will
[38:29] feel it
[38:30] but you see there is a present tense
[38:33] thirst quencher now brother brown said
[38:35] now we find out that the churches too
[38:37] are they're always promising something
[38:39] always looking for something far off he
[38:42] said like like television and so forth
[38:44] and i believe what he's saying there is
[38:46] he's a lot of these television programs
[38:48] well like the news a lot of times this
[38:51] we're going to be we're going to be
[38:52] talking about something in this news
[38:54] program and they keep putting it off and
[38:55] putting it off until you've done watched
[38:57] a whole hour waiting for this little
[38:58] five minute thing that they're gonna be
[39:00] showing they keep putting something off
[39:02] putting something off and he said that
[39:03] they never get to the thing that they
[39:05] promised as i often said an old
[39:06] quotation man is always praising god for
[39:08] what he did
[39:10] praising god for what he will do
[39:12] looking forward to what he will do and
[39:14] then ignore what he's doing and that's
[39:16] the way they become history after a
[39:18] while the polluted sea because they fail
[39:20] to recognize now you can talk of the
[39:23] comfort christ give once and say that a
[39:25] comfort he get will give in the ages to
[39:27] come but refuse the comfort that he's
[39:30] got here for you now he's got it for you
[39:33] here now
[39:34] now
[39:36] let's pull up this next quote um that
[39:38] starts with even to our confessions
[39:40] because this is this is a i think this
[39:42] is a very special quote this is a quote
[39:45] that brother branham while he was
[39:46] preaching
[39:48] said
[39:48] listen to this quote now that's a very
[39:51] strange thing to say while you're
[39:52] preaching now let's read it he said even
[39:55] to our confessions
[39:57] now i want you people that are coming
[39:59] or on the tape
[40:01] i want you to listen close now
[40:03] for a moment
[40:05] to this quotation
[40:07] i'm saying it real slow so they can pull
[40:10] it up in the back
[40:14] it should be paragraph 61.
[40:19] that's not it
[40:21] that's not it either
[40:26] thank you
[40:29] even to our confessions now i want you
[40:31] people that are coming or here and hold
[40:33] or on the tape
[40:34] i want you to listen close now for a
[40:36] moment
[40:37] to this quotation
[40:41] but
[40:42] all right there we go excellent
[40:44] now listen listen close because he's
[40:46] going to tell you the recipe
[40:48] he's going to outline it for you and
[40:50] then we're going to go through this
[40:51] quote
[40:52] with painstaking deliberation
[40:56] he said unless you are deeply sincere
[41:00] and you cannot be sincere until you're
[41:02] positive understand
[41:05] if you're presuming or guessing or
[41:07] hoping so then there cannot be a depth
[41:09] of sincerity that god requires it
[41:12] faith is not a hope so or it could be
[41:15] right it's got to be absolutely amen
[41:19] it's your ultimate
[41:20] it's your absolute
[41:22] it's the thing that you're tied to see
[41:24] you have come to your ultimate that it
[41:27] is the truth and there's it's nothing
[41:29] but the truth
[41:30] and it must be thus
[41:32] and then when you realize that in your
[41:34] mind
[41:35] then you've got to approach it with your
[41:38] whole life soul body
[41:41] all that's in you just completely sell
[41:44] out everything to it
[41:47] jesus so graciously taught us in the
[41:50] in the um
[41:53] in the man buying pearls and he found
[41:55] the one of great price and he sold all
[41:56] his others to get to it
[41:59] all the truths and everything that he
[42:01] had thought they were good pearls this
[42:03] one meant all to him
[42:05] and when you find god's ultimate his
[42:08] word a promise upon a certain thing you
[42:10] must know first that it is god's word
[42:13] that the thing that you're seeing being
[42:15] done is god
[42:17] there's no maybe so it could be it looks
[42:20] like it might be it is god
[42:22] then when you get to that spot then
[42:24] that's the pearl of great price you must
[42:27] get away from anything that anybody else
[42:30] tells you contrary to it
[42:32] you must not look to what man has
[42:34] achieved
[42:35] you must look to what god has said and
[42:37] what he promised and see him to do it
[42:39] then that's your ultimate right there
[42:42] and then everything that you are
[42:43] everything that you was everything that
[42:45] you hope to be must be placed upon this
[42:48] just as though it was death and life to
[42:51] you at that moment
[42:53] now let's go to the next slide
[42:56] excuse me
[42:58] now now think about this what he's
[43:00] saying is that god cares but the
[43:03] question is do you care
[43:05] and he's telling you how to recognize
[43:07] whether or not you care or not
[43:09] do you care because until you care the
[43:11] word cannot become activated in your
[43:13] life it can cannot become manifested in
[43:16] your life and you know i i wonder today
[43:19] today this is the hour when we should be
[43:21] caring more than ever you can look
[43:23] around and see the things that have come
[43:24] upon the earth and this is the hour when
[43:26] we should be getting really serious
[43:29] so brother adam said unless you are
[43:30] deeply sincere
[43:32] now sincerity brother brahm said that's
[43:34] what the angel told me in praying said
[43:36] if you'll be sincere and will get the
[43:37] people to believe you and nothing shall
[43:39] stand before your prayer
[43:40] sincerity is what at each stage of his
[43:43] ministry as he was advancing on and
[43:45] going higher and higher the angel would
[43:47] come to him and tell him be more sincere
[43:50] and the message paradox just then the
[43:52] serpent turned to me when i said and
[43:54] looked at me again and a voice came for
[43:55] me when he saw that vision of the
[43:56] serpent and said you've been given power
[43:58] to bind him the worst or any and i said
[44:00] well god what must i do he said there's
[44:02] one thing you must do you must be more
[44:04] sincere
[44:06] you must be more sincere so if we must
[44:09] be more sincere we've got to find out
[44:10] how to be sincere what is sincerity
[44:13] sincerity is free from pretense or
[44:16] deceit proceeding from genuine feelings
[44:19] sincerity is just being honest with
[44:21] yourself and and expressing that in a
[44:23] genuine way you're there's nothing
[44:25] there's nothing
[44:27] you're expressing the true what you
[44:29] truly are
[44:31] what you are is what you should be
[44:34] like i've always said just be if you're
[44:35] a sinner just be a genuine sinner and
[44:37] then when god fills you with the holy
[44:39] ghost then you'll there will be a
[44:41] genuine transformation
[44:43] sincerity is being sober understanding
[44:46] comprehending faith really coming to it
[44:48] with with a sober mind understanding
[44:50] that it's not something to just laugh
[44:52] about and and we're not coming just just
[44:54] just making fun and we're coming with
[44:57] sincerity because you know really the
[44:58] house of god is a place to die and
[45:00] that's a
[45:01] like a funeral home is a very sincere
[45:04] place because somebody's laying in the
[45:05] casket and what happens in church is
[45:07] people are coming to die to themselves
[45:09] die out to the things of this world and
[45:11] become near receive the newness of life
[45:14] in christ
[45:15] and brother said what if i said now i'm
[45:17] going to confess it that i done wrong if
[45:19] if he did something wrong with his wife
[45:21] or whatever he said i said good lord o
[45:22] friend of mine you know that i know you
[45:25] real well praise god
[45:27] hallelujah i think you're a good old
[45:29] fellow if he was to come to god like
[45:31] that would that be sincerity would that
[45:33] be an honest confession out of a sincere
[45:35] heart that's not sincerity
[45:38] and he said i think one of the things
[45:40] that keeps our people from being healed
[45:42] is the lack of confession is the lack of
[45:44] sincere confession
[45:46] the lack of sincere confession to
[45:48] confess where you are that god i'm wrong
[45:52] i've done things wrong and to confess
[45:53] with a sincere heart what you believe
[45:55] the word the promise of god to be to
[45:57] come sincerely
[45:59] god knows what kind of a person you are
[46:01] and what your problems are and those
[46:02] kind of things just come to him
[46:03] sincerely and meet him sincerely and
[46:06] something will happen
[46:11] and the next thing is to recognize that
[46:13] he cares
[46:14] if we could just recognize that god is
[46:16] on the scene right now that he's mindful
[46:18] of you and your situation that he wants
[46:21] to fill you with the holy ghost brother
[46:22] brahm said he wants to give you the holy
[46:24] ghost more than you want it he wants to
[46:26] give you the holy ghost so might be but
[46:28] he can't override your free moral agency
[46:32] and he's waiting on you to accept it
[46:34] he's waiting on you to be sincere to
[46:37] receive it with a sincere heart he wants
[46:39] you to be healed how about that we've
[46:41] been thinking about the holy ghost and
[46:43] and and kind of looking around maybe at
[46:45] others but what about your healing if
[46:46] there's something wrong in your body
[46:49] something in your body that needs to be
[46:50] healed god is standing by to give you
[46:53] that healing if you can just accept it
[46:55] with a sincere heart
[46:56] he doesn't want you to suffer he wants
[46:58] the best for you
[47:01] and brother brown said you have to
[47:02] approach it
[47:04] with all that's in you
[47:06] and i think that is the definition of
[47:08] caring if you look about around at
[47:11] others and
[47:12] see somebody like david said in psalms
[47:15] chapter 69 for the zeal of thine house
[47:17] that house hath eaten me up
[47:20] you see somebody that's zealous for the
[47:21] lord that they've given everything for
[47:23] the lord that that's somebody that
[47:25] really cares about the things of god
[47:28] in matthew chapter 11 it says from the
[47:30] days of john the baptist until now the
[47:31] kingdom of heaven suffereth violence and
[47:33] the violence take it by force you know
[47:36] if you want something from god sometimes
[47:38] you have to take it by force you have to
[47:40] get serious with god you have to become
[47:42] zealous and a zealous caring person is
[47:44] not going to be sitting at home when the
[47:46] doors are open they're going to care
[47:48] about the word of god because their
[47:50] appetite has changed when when when you
[47:52] really begin to care about god you know
[47:54] from where your help comes from and so
[47:57] you will you will seek that come what
[48:00] may
[48:01] you'll be like jacob we're ready to just
[48:04] just almost be a little shyster to get
[48:06] to get a blessing from god ready to do
[48:07] whatever it takes
[48:09] in mark chapter 12 verse 29 to 30 and
[48:12] jesus answered him the first of all the
[48:13] commandments is hear o israel the lord
[48:15] our god is one lord and thou shalt love
[48:17] the lord thy god with all thy heart and
[48:19] with all thy soul and with all thy mind
[48:22] and with all thy strength this is the
[48:24] first commandment now it doesn't say to
[48:26] love the lord thy god without with part
[48:28] of your heart a part of your soul a part
[48:30] of your mind but to give yourself
[48:32] completely over to god completely to him
[48:35] that means that means not being a good
[48:37] christian at church when the doors are
[48:39] open and going home and going back into
[48:41] the filth of this world and doing things
[48:42] in secret but that means giving yourself
[48:44] holy over to god and if you're not doing
[48:46] those things if you haven't given
[48:49] yourself completely over to god then
[48:50] it's time to come with sincerity with a
[48:53] sincere heart and make an honest
[48:55] confession to god and see what happens
[48:58] see what happens if you'll follow this
[49:00] prescription and i i don't mean to tire
[49:03] you and bore you with these things this
[49:05] is the prescription that god gave us to
[49:07] follow if we'll just follow this
[49:08] prescription that we have a promise that
[49:11] god will prove to us that we have taken
[49:13] the vaccine
[49:15] do you have the proof that you've taken
[49:16] the vaccine
[49:19] he said know that the ultimate is god's
[49:21] word in galatians chapter 1 verse 6 to
[49:23] 11 i marvel that you are so soon removed
[49:26] from him that called you into the grace
[49:27] of god
[49:28] of christ unto another gospel
[49:30] he said but thou we though we or an
[49:32] angel from heaven preach any other
[49:34] gospel unto you than that which we have
[49:36] preached unto you let him be accursed in
[49:37] other words to know to know that the
[49:40] gospel is your ultimate
[49:42] in other words to say it another way our
[49:44] own ideas are not the authority what
[49:47] your friend says to you is not the
[49:49] authority well
[49:50] what
[49:51] different preachers in the message say
[49:53] is not the authority if it deviates from
[49:55] the word the word of god is the ultimate
[49:58] authority and if you follow the word of
[50:00] god and receive it with sincerity with
[50:03] an honest and a contrite heart it will
[50:05] manifest what it says it will prove to
[50:08] you it will be the interpretation of the
[50:10] word it will be the proof that you have
[50:12] taken the vaccine
[50:16] he said look to what god has said and he
[50:18] has promised
[50:19] and that is your ultimate
[50:21] in revelation chapter 22 it says if any
[50:23] man shall add unto these things god
[50:25] shall add unto him the plagues that are
[50:26] written in this book why because the
[50:28] word of god is our ultimate
[50:30] and then brother branham goes on to say
[50:32] know that what you're seeing being done
[50:34] is god if you can recognize god's
[50:38] presence if you can recognize that when
[50:39] a minister is up behind the pulpit and
[50:41] and saying what agrees with the word and
[50:44] recognize god's pro god's presence
[50:47] something will happen in luke chapter 24
[50:50] verse 30 they were they were they were
[50:52] on the road to emmaus they went behind
[50:53] the closed door and they hadn't
[50:55] recognized him until he did something in
[50:57] their midst and it says and then their
[50:59] eyes were opened and they knew him and
[51:01] he vanished out of their sight
[51:03] when your eyes become open to the
[51:05] presence of god something's bound to
[51:07] happen
[51:08] now i remember years ago i was in a
[51:10] little meeting
[51:12] it was just a little small country
[51:14] church and and the service seemed so dry
[51:16] and
[51:17] maybe like
[51:20] well
[51:21] it just seemed you know a lot of people
[51:23] were real sleepy that was i think there
[51:24] was somebody on the front row that had
[51:26] fallen asleep and and just looking
[51:27] around my this is uh this seems like an
[51:29] old tired church but right in the midst
[51:32] of that service
[51:33] a little a young man in the back of the
[51:35] church his eyes became open to the
[51:37] presence of god that god cared and even
[51:40] right there in the midst of that what
[51:42] seemed like an old tired assembly that
[51:44] young man i i watched i i remember being
[51:47] astounded at how god can move a god if
[51:50] god can touch your heart it don't matter
[51:52] if the whole rest of the assembly is
[51:54] falling asleep or whatever that young
[51:56] man came up to the altar and he began to
[51:58] cry out to god right in the middle of
[52:00] the service because his eyes came open
[52:03] and he began to realize that god cared
[52:05] for him and so he responded by caring
[52:08] for god you see it doesn't matter what
[52:10] we look so many times
[52:12] everybody else in the circumstances
[52:14] everything but if god can just touch
[52:16] your heart if you'll respond and be
[52:18] receptive to his calling something will
[52:20] happen
[52:22] remember the the story in the first
[52:24] kings of elijah sitting there and he
[52:25] heard all the earthquake and all the
[52:27] fire and all those kind of things but
[52:29] but what got him what caused him to
[52:31] recognize the presence of god was that
[52:33] still small voice speaking to his heart
[52:36] if you'll just hear that still small
[52:37] voice listen people might be running and
[52:39] jumping around you or they might not be
[52:41] people might be sitting there with half
[52:43] eyes and falling asleep but if you'll
[52:45] just recognize that that's that still
[52:47] small voice speaking to you god can move
[52:49] to you and god can do something to you
[52:52] and then brother branham said confess
[52:54] everything that they have did if you'll
[52:56] confess everything that you've done now
[52:58] listen he's preparing he's preparing the
[53:01] people to receive what they have need of
[53:03] before they come into the prayer line
[53:05] he's giving them a recipe to receive
[53:07] what they have need of so that they can
[53:09] receive healing of the baptism of the
[53:11] holy ghost and he said
[53:13] i believe that a man or woman coming to
[53:15] be prayed for should first confess
[53:17] everything that they have did and make
[53:19] everything right
[53:21] because you see you notice lots of times
[53:24] on the platform you notice watch how far
[53:27] away that thus saith the lord is
[53:30] let's pause and meditate on that quote
[53:32] for a second how far away thus saith the
[53:35] lord is
[53:36] now he said people's faith can bring a
[53:39] vision if they come through the prayer
[53:40] line and the vision will show them what
[53:42] their street number is the vision will
[53:44] show them what where they were born or
[53:45] what their name is the vision will show
[53:47] them all those kind of things but he
[53:48] says
[53:49] look how far away thus saith the lord is
[53:53] now you think as many people would walk
[53:54] through the prayer line go back and
[53:56] listen how many times he would tell them
[53:59] thus saith the lord
[54:01] you are healed
[54:03] thus saith the lord you have received
[54:07] now many times they would come through
[54:08] and he said go on your way believing and
[54:10] you'll receive what you ask go on your
[54:12] way but how many times did he say thus
[54:14] saith lord how far away is that thus
[54:16] saith the lord now brother branham's not
[54:18] here with us now but yet you can still
[54:20] have the confidence of a revelation that
[54:23] jesus christ gives to you personally
[54:25] where you know despite what the doctor
[54:27] tells you despite what people with all
[54:29] the naysayers around the world despite
[54:31] what anybody tells you you can have that
[54:33] same confidence in your heart today that
[54:36] somebody going through that prayer line
[54:38] god one brother abraham said thus saith
[54:40] the lord i believe you could still have
[54:42] that same confidence and how do you get
[54:45] that same confidence wake up for a
[54:47] little bit it's by following the recipe
[54:50] follow the recipe confess everything
[54:52] that you've done
[54:54] come sincerity with an honest and a
[54:55] contrite heart come believing accepting
[54:59] recognizing that that's that's not just
[55:01] a man behind the pulpit but when he
[55:03] reads the quotes from the prophet when
[55:04] he when he says what brother brahma said
[55:06] when he says what the bible says
[55:08] recognize that god is in the house god
[55:11] is in the midst and that he cares for
[55:13] you and then you will respond with
[55:15] caring yourself if you you see the
[55:18] problem is your heart it's not your head
[55:20] and your head you can receive all this
[55:22] knowledge but if your heart begins to
[55:23] respond with caring when you begin to
[55:26] care back something will happen
[55:29] but abraham said unless the world
[55:30] repents it's got to percy and confession
[55:33] is what the world needs today
[55:35] is honest confession
[55:37] i remember and now i'm not trying to be
[55:39] mean or anything but one time i i was
[55:41] preaching on repentance and i just got
[55:43] to preaching on repentance a lot and
[55:44] after a service somebody came up to me
[55:46] and said you preach on repentance too
[55:48] much i wish you would preach on
[55:49] something else but you know what i
[55:50] believe that's what the church needs i
[55:52] believe the church needs to repent i
[55:54] believe the church needs to confess i
[55:56] believe maybe that's what we need more
[55:58] than ever is to get serious serious
[56:00] enough with god to where we find out
[56:03] whether we have taken the vaccine or not
[56:04] because i believe i perceive that many
[56:07] have not taken the vaccine that's been
[56:09] prescribed to us we've read what's on
[56:11] the bottle we've read the bible we've
[56:13] got the letter on the page but we
[56:14] haven't received it the way that it's
[56:16] been prescribed to us
[56:19] and then he said get away from anything
[56:21] anybody tells you contrary
[56:25] get away from anything anybody tells you
[56:27] contrary
[56:28] in amos chapter 3 it says can two walk
[56:30] together he said they be agreed
[56:33] blessed is the man that walketh not in
[56:35] the counsel of the ungodly not listening
[56:37] to all your all your negative friends
[56:39] all your unbelieving friends that tell
[56:40] you the all the all the many things that
[56:42] they think are wrong with the message
[56:44] that they think are wrong with the bible
[56:46] get away from all that negativity and
[56:47] get yourself centered get your head
[56:49] stuck in the holy of holies get so far
[56:51] into the holy of holies until all you
[56:53] can hear is the cherubim's wings all you
[56:55] can hear is the beating of the wings of
[56:57] god as he ministers to you and proves
[57:00] his word to you get so far away from all
[57:02] the commotion of the world until you're
[57:04] not you're not afraid of the coronavirus
[57:06] you're not afraid of the things that are
[57:08] falling on the earth get so far in there
[57:10] until you know whether whether or not
[57:12] you have taken the vaccine or not
[57:15] like that like that eagle in the
[57:17] barnyard story brother brown told you
[57:18] know how the eagle began to recognize
[57:20] that he wasn't a chicken when you
[57:22] recognize that you're not a chicken you
[57:24] don't want to be with the chickens
[57:25] anymore you don't want to be with the
[57:27] chickens you want to be with the eagles
[57:29] and that's why he got he hopped up on
[57:30] the fence post and began to listen to
[57:33] that voice screaming down from from up
[57:35] on high because he realized there was
[57:37] something different about himself
[57:39] there was something you know what what
[57:40] was different was that god knew from
[57:42] before that foundation of the world that
[57:44] that eagle would care when that mama
[57:47] eagle went over that chicken barnyard
[57:49] that eagle that mama eagle was caring
[57:51] for that little eagle down in the
[57:52] barnyard the eagle in the barnyard cared
[57:55] he cared enough to listen he cared
[57:57] enough to get out of that chicken yard
[57:59] and then brother brown said and then
[58:00] everything that you are
[58:02] everything that you was
[58:04] everything that you hope to be
[58:07] everything about yourself
[58:09] must be placed upon this
[58:12] just as though it was death and life to
[58:15] you at that moment
[58:17] because it is
[58:19] you know many times we talked about how
[58:20] we don't hang one and hang people over
[58:22] the hell fire like like some
[58:24] denominations and that kind of thing
[58:27] but i wonder if it's time to get a
[58:28] little bit serious you know brother
[58:29] brown said
[58:31] in one place he said if the if you could
[58:32] look if the door at the door at the
[58:34] floor just were to open up and you could
[58:36] gaze down into hell you would see the
[58:38] people in hell climbing over one another
[58:41] trying to get another chance to hear the
[58:44] gospel trying to get another chance to
[58:46] receive the gospel and you are still
[58:48] alive there's breath in your body and
[58:50] you still have a chance to receive this
[58:52] gospel don't be don't give up this
[58:55] chance that you've got because they wish
[58:57] that they could have another chance they
[58:59] wish that they could have one more
[59:01] opportunity to sit in a service like you
[59:03] do
[59:04] i wonder maybe if we could just just
[59:05] just kind of express to you the danger
[59:08] that so many souls are in in this a this
[59:11] hour to not realize how much god cares
[59:13] for you to turn that down
[59:16] my
[59:17] see he cares but do you care
[59:20] do you care enough to follow the
[59:22] prescription to the letter
[59:24] do you care enough to take the medicine
[59:28] yeah you see i realize i believe that
[59:30] this message he cares do you care is
[59:33] really a doctor examination where
[59:35] brother brown it's like you come into
[59:37] the doctor's office and you're listening
[59:38] to the sermon and you're you're laying
[59:40] on the table or sitting there on the
[59:41] table with the paper on it and you're
[59:43] letting the doctor look at you and and
[59:46] and and examine you and the doctor says
[59:48] the doctor's looking at you and you say
[59:50] well i still got pain
[59:52] i still got pain in my leg i still got i
[59:54] still got all these symptoms of sin and
[59:57] the doctor will look at you dr brother
[59:59] branham as you're listening to the
[1:00:00] message the doctor is looking at you and
[1:00:02] saying well did you take the medicine
[1:00:05] did you take the medicine because if you
[1:00:06] took the medicine there's a promise with
[1:00:09] the medicine that if you take the
[1:00:10] medicine that it will be manifested in
[1:00:13] your life
[1:00:14] if you take the medicine you will get
[1:00:16] the holy ghost if you take it in the
[1:00:18] right way you will get the holy ghost
[1:00:20] and it's not something like we were
[1:00:22] talking about these young people that
[1:00:24] will say well
[1:00:25] who knows how long it's going to take me
[1:00:27] to get the new birth it might be five
[1:00:28] years from now who knew i i think it's
[1:00:31] time to get serious about getting the
[1:00:32] new birth because you don't know what
[1:00:34] tomorrow holds
[1:00:36] talking saying things about well i don't
[1:00:38] even know the the the rapture might not
[1:00:40] come until until where all all my
[1:00:43] parents are dead and gone why would you
[1:00:45] even say something like that do you know
[1:00:47] the scripture says that they would say
[1:00:49] he delayeth his coming he's putting it
[1:00:51] off but his coming his coming is right
[1:00:54] now his coming is right now because it's
[1:00:57] coming as the revealing of his word if
[1:00:59] his coming is the revealing of his word
[1:01:00] i wonder if you could be missing his
[1:01:02] coming right now i wonder if you could
[1:01:04] be missing the rapture right now and not
[1:01:06] realize it so as we examine you get up
[1:01:09] on the doctor's table we examine you and
[1:01:11] look you over have you taken the
[1:01:12] doctor's medicine
[1:01:14] have you taken the medicine
[1:01:16] brother brown said but and then how we
[1:01:18] say
[1:01:19] but we took it but we took it we we've
[1:01:21] been to church we read the label
[1:01:24] and we think that's taken and he said
[1:01:26] and if you say you took it and the
[1:01:28] patience shows no results he didn't take
[1:01:32] it
[1:01:33] in this message he said he that heareth
[1:01:35] my word
[1:01:36] for instance he that heareth my words
[1:01:38] and believeth on him that sent me has
[1:01:40] eternal life
[1:01:41] or king james puts it but everlasting
[1:01:43] which is eternal has eternal life
[1:01:45] because he's believed many people say
[1:01:47] they believe
[1:01:49] now that is true the scripture is
[1:01:50] correct i'm reading the prescription i'm
[1:01:53] reading what the prescription is and the
[1:01:56] antidote for my sin but can i take it
[1:01:59] can i believe i might say i believe but
[1:02:02] do i believe
[1:02:04] that's the next thing just read it and
[1:02:05] know the directions
[1:02:07] doesn't cure the disease
[1:02:09] the trouble is that in our case we won't
[1:02:11] take what the remedy says do
[1:02:13] we got the remedy
[1:02:15] but we won't take it we say we do
[1:02:18] because we can read it but to really
[1:02:20] take it we don't do it i i hope this is
[1:02:24] really sinking in and it's not putting
[1:02:26] anybody to sleep
[1:02:27] wake up just for a little bit longer
[1:02:28] we're almost we're almost over see the
[1:02:30] gospel is the same way a medicine in
[1:02:33] this case if the patient and the remedy
[1:02:35] has been proven to cure the patient and
[1:02:37] the patient reads all about the
[1:02:39] discovery of this drug and they know
[1:02:41] every ounce of medicine that's in it
[1:02:43] they know all the scientists name that
[1:02:45] found this certain drug like the saw do
[1:02:47] you realize what he's saying there's a
[1:02:49] mess we know there's a message we know
[1:02:51] that god sent a prophet we know all
[1:02:53] these people that preach before we know
[1:02:55] all the big names we know all these
[1:02:57] things
[1:02:58] if we know all the word about it but
[1:03:00] refuse to take it it won't help us
[1:03:04] so as we examine ourselves this morning
[1:03:06] let's see what the proof is that you
[1:03:08] have taken the vaccine
[1:03:11] has your appetite changed when you take
[1:03:14] this vaccine you will not be hungry and
[1:03:16] thirsting for the things of this world
[1:03:18] you your appetite will be for the word
[1:03:20] of god like that dream that zach had
[1:03:22] where he was sitting at the table and
[1:03:24] all he just kept eating and eating and
[1:03:26] eating and eating and he never got full
[1:03:28] because he was hungry he was hungry for
[1:03:30] the word and that's what that's the
[1:03:32] effect of taking the vaccine when you're
[1:03:34] like when you begin to get ambivalent
[1:03:36] and uncaring about coming to church well
[1:03:38] i just don't care i don't care about if
[1:03:41] you say i don't care about listening to
[1:03:43] the sermons if you say i don't care
[1:03:45] about getting into my bible i wonder if
[1:03:48] you have taken the vaccine i wonder if
[1:03:50] you care enough about getting in the
[1:03:51] word i wonder if you care enough that
[1:03:54] jesus cares have your desires changed
[1:03:57] has god changed your desires from the
[1:03:59] things of this world can you look back
[1:04:02] through your life and see that once you
[1:04:04] were like this but now you're like this
[1:04:06] once you were maybe desire to smoke
[1:04:08] cigarettes and desire to do all those
[1:04:10] things all the things of the flesh
[1:04:12] i know
[1:04:13] what what we believe about the flesh and
[1:04:15] all that kind of thing listen
[1:04:18] have your desires changed examine
[1:04:20] yourself to see
[1:04:22] if you're in a different spot now than
[1:04:24] you were years ago has something has a
[1:04:26] change been wrought in you because if
[1:04:28] you've taken the vaccine you're not
[1:04:30] going to be in the same place that you
[1:04:31] were years ago
[1:04:33] and the main thing have your eyes been
[1:04:35] open when you come to church and you
[1:04:37] don't understand the things that are
[1:04:38] being preached you don't you read your
[1:04:40] bible and you don't understand have you
[1:04:42] taken the vaccine have you received it
[1:04:44] according to the prescription
[1:04:46] have you received the vaccine
[1:04:50] have your eyes been open have your eyes
[1:04:52] been opened to understanding is your
[1:04:54] character changing
[1:04:55] all these tempers and impatience and all
[1:04:57] that that kind of stuff should be
[1:04:59] falling away as the word is being
[1:05:00] revealed in you
[1:05:03] after a while you shouldn't see a temper
[1:05:05] anymore after a while you should see
[1:05:07] that temper that impatience beginning to
[1:05:09] fade away after a while you should see
[1:05:10] the love of god being manifested in your
[1:05:12] life
[1:05:13] and not being all angry because you know
[1:05:15] if you care if you really care about god
[1:05:17] you'll care about your brothers
[1:05:19] you care about your sisters the real
[1:05:21] love of god being made manifest in you
[1:05:25] i'm trying to wind up here bc
[1:05:28] you got to be born again
[1:05:30] you must be born again
[1:05:32] and to be born again you've got to care
[1:05:35] you've got to if you come to church and
[1:05:36] you're uh well that preacher's just
[1:05:38] going to preach another tired so you
[1:05:39] know you know the reason it's a tired
[1:05:41] old tired old sermon a lot of times it's
[1:05:43] because you don't care
[1:05:45] it's because you know somebody that
[1:05:47] comes like that that story i was telling
[1:05:49] you a little a little brother in the
[1:05:51] back of that it seemed like an old tired
[1:05:52] church but he cared and that church
[1:05:54] service was not old dried up to him
[1:05:57] it didn't matter if people were running
[1:05:58] all the aisles or not but that church
[1:06:00] service meant something to him because
[1:06:02] he was dying out to his old self and
[1:06:04] something was something is being
[1:06:06] quickened in him if you'll if you'll
[1:06:07] begin to care it won't be old dried up
[1:06:09] service anymore
[1:06:12] brother brown says it and he cares do
[1:06:13] you care he said you take a person says
[1:06:15] that they are i am a believer i believe
[1:06:17] let the gospel light strike them brother
[1:06:20] they'll take it right now
[1:06:22] if you say you're a believer when the
[1:06:23] word is preached you'll take it you'll
[1:06:24] receive it
[1:06:25] and
[1:06:26] they'll show results
[1:06:28] that's the proof that you've taken the
[1:06:30] vaccine is when you see results
[1:06:32] signs and wonders will follow them that
[1:06:34] believe
[1:06:35] they shall cast out devils in my name
[1:06:37] that they shall take up deadly serpents
[1:06:39] they shall dream deadly things
[1:06:41] they shall do all these things why
[1:06:42] because they've taken the vaccine
[1:06:44] they've been vaccinated against the
[1:06:46] things of this world i believe in a
[1:06:48] vaccine this morning and brother braham
[1:06:49] called it a toxin he said i believe a
[1:06:51] toxic if you've got this toxin the
[1:06:54] vaccination in you it will it will
[1:06:56] protect you from all of the elements of
[1:06:58] the world all of the things that the
[1:07:00] devil throws you and and the more of
[1:07:02] this toxin this vaccination that you
[1:07:04] receive the more protected you are
[1:07:07] the more protected you know i heard a
[1:07:09] preacher years ago
[1:07:10] and i really like this he said the
[1:07:12] reason that this toxin has people
[1:07:14] ministers have diluted this toxin down
[1:07:17] until it's not effective anymore they've
[1:07:19] watered it down by not sharing with them
[1:07:22] what brother branham preached they've
[1:07:23] watered it down to try to get popularity
[1:07:25] to try to get people to like them but my
[1:07:28] if we can get to a place where we don't
[1:07:29] care about whether we're popular or not
[1:07:31] and share the toxin in his power there
[1:07:33] is power in this toxination and this
[1:07:36] vaccination to protect you and to show
[1:07:39] that god cares about you to show that he
[1:07:41] he he he's a comfort to you
[1:07:48] i know we're getting wrong on around now
[1:07:50] i i see i know i know after about 45
[1:07:52] minutes people begin to kind of your
[1:07:54] mind stops working and ticking in the
[1:07:55] way that it used to
[1:07:57] and my there's so many things that i
[1:07:59] wanted to get to this morning
[1:08:02] about how the brother brown said that
[1:08:03] there's two churches this morning and
[1:08:05] how the one church is reasoning against
[1:08:07] the word of god and the things that
[1:08:08] brother wade's been preaching and about
[1:08:10] how
[1:08:11] it's really a heart condition not a mind
[1:08:13] condition where you don't look at it
[1:08:15] intellectually see that's the whole the
[1:08:17] whole problem was we look at it all
[1:08:18] intellectually with our mind instead of
[1:08:21] letting our heart get into condition to
[1:08:23] just receive god's word
[1:08:25] to just receive his word
[1:08:27] so let's i'm going to stop right there
[1:08:29] if the musicians want to go ahead and
[1:08:30] come
[1:08:31] brother brown was talking about the
[1:08:32] condition of this age and and and just
