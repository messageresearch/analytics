[5:12] skin. You put him somewhere else outside

[5:57] the majority of times I God inspire me,
[6:00] then I just preach. That just that just
[6:03] every man be different. That's right. I
[6:05] tried to talk brother Sam into preaching
[6:06] this morning cuz good preaching. He
[6:10] said, "No." He said, "I'm going to I'm
[6:11] not going to do it." I said, "Man, so

[6:18] appreciate you. Uh my family, my wife,
[6:20] and brother Tim sends his greetings. So,
[6:23] we just thank the Lord this morning. I'm
[6:26] going to go to two places in the
[6:27] scripture this morning.
[6:30] I want to read I just maybe just read
[6:33] one place then I follow over to the next
[6:36] scripture after we pray and be seated.
[6:38] But I want to read from the book of
[6:39] Exodus
[6:41] the 24th chapter this morning.
[6:44] The book of Exodus, the 24th chapter.
[6:52] The book of Exodus, the 24th chapter.
[6:56] And I'm going to read from verse 15 down
[6:59] through
[7:02] 18.
[7:05] And it read like this. And Moses went up
[7:08] into the mount, and a cloud covered the
[7:13] mount,
[7:14] and the glory of the Lord
[7:18] the glory of the Lord above upon the
[7:20] mount Zi, and the And the cloud cover it
[7:25] six days. Y and the seventh day he
[7:28] called unto Moses out of the midst of
[7:32] the cloud, right?
[7:34] And the sight of the glory of the Lord
[7:37] was
[7:39] like a divine
[7:42] divine fire on on the top of the mount
[7:46] and in the eyes of the childrens of
[7:49] Israel. And Moses went into the midst of
[7:52] the what?
[7:54] And n him up into the into the mount.
[7:58] And Moses was in the mount 40 days and
[8:03] 40 nights. Let's pray. Our gracious
[8:07] Father,
[8:09] help me one more time to yield my body.
[8:11] That's right. And my mind, God, help me
[8:14] to surrender my mind to you, God. Yes,
[8:16] Lord. Father, I trust God that you speak
[8:18] through my lips, Lord. Help me, Lord, to
[8:22] completely uh uh get myself out of the
[8:24] way, Lord. Now, Father, I trust that you
[8:27] do the peoples likewise. Help them to
[8:30] submit themselves to the will of God and
[8:32] to the spirit of truth. Father, now
[8:34] Father God, we ask you God to bless the
[8:36] service this morning that your word help
[8:38] the total preeminence. We ask you in
[8:40] Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. Thank
[8:43] the Lord for the reading of the word of
[8:45] God this morning. I
[8:52] I thank the Lord for reading of his word
[8:54] this morning. Amen. And I ain't
[8:56] temporary. We run here. I want to uh
[8:59] take for a title this morning before I
[9:01] start. I want to talk on the place of
[9:04] ascending up to. Amen. Okay. The place
[9:08] of ascending up to. And I want to uh
[9:12] begin to we want to talk on a a sending
[9:15] up. Amen. And I as I begin to look here
[9:18] that we read the scripture, Moses went
[9:21] into the mountain and Moses was there.
[9:23] And the mountain, the Bible say he was
[9:26] up into the into the mountain for 40
[9:28] days and 40 nights. That's right.
[9:30] Hallelujah. He had a place that he
[9:32] ascended to. That's right. And I want to
[9:34] tell you because we realize here that's
[9:36] what we come to. And when we come to a
[9:39] revelation this hour, this revelation is
[9:41] the right now as you s God have called
[9:45] you not to descend. He'll call you to
[9:49] ascend up. This is a rapture message.
[9:53] Amen. And I'm going to begin to read. I
[9:55] want to read my second scripture I was
[9:57] going to look at was Isaiah.
[10:01] The book of Isaiah the 14th chapter.
[10:09] The book of Isaiah the 14th chapter.
[10:11] That's right. And I want to read I'm
[10:14] going to begin reading at verse 12.
[10:18] And and we want to look here that we
[10:20] want to see here what Satan desires,
[10:23] right? Uh Isaiah the 14th chapter verse
[10:27] 12. And it says, "How falling from
[10:31] heaven, oh Lucifer,
[10:34] the son of the morning, right? How thou
[10:37] cut down to to the ground which did
[10:40] weaken the nation.
[10:42] For thou has said in thy heart, Yep. I
[10:45] will I want you to notice this. I will
[10:48] right ascend
[10:51] and ascend into the heavens.
[10:55] I will
[10:56] exalt my throne above the stars of God.
[11:00] Right? I will set also up on the mouth
[11:04] of the congregation in the sides of the
[11:07] north. Right? I will. If you notice
[11:10] here, he is claiming his will to ascend.
[11:14] Right? Hallelujah. He had no position
[11:17] because we realized when God cast him
[11:19] down, he put him on the ground. Exactly.
[11:22] And his job was, I will ascend up. Yep.
[11:26] Right. I will ascend up above the
[11:29] heights of the clouds. I will be like
[11:33] the most high. So Satan is declaring his
[11:37] a send it up and he begin to realize he
[11:40] is claiming a place of sending up. I
[11:43] will ascend into the heavens. I will
[11:47] exalt my uh throne above the stars of
[11:50] the sons of God and I will set also on
[11:54] the mouth of the congregation in the
[11:57] sides of the north. I will be like the
[12:00] most high. And I begin to look here and
[12:02] I took that word here and I and I looked
[12:04] it up. He he and that word to send is to
[12:08] it means to elevate up high. That's
[12:12] right. It is exalted. It's the most
[12:14] high. It's the supreme being. Uh it's
[12:17] the supreme being. It's the true God. In
[12:20] other words, Satan is declaring, "I will
[12:23] ascend, I will exalt my mouth. Uh I will
[12:27] exalt myself above the supreme being,
[12:30] God." That's right. And then what his
[12:32] job is? His job is to try. His job is to
[12:35] take the position that did not even
[12:38] belong to him. Right. Amen. I begin to
[12:40] look here. I begin to realize here that
[12:42] I begin to look at these things and I
[12:44] realize that Satan job is he won't rule
[12:48] Mhm. or be above God. Exactly. And he's
[12:53] want this position. Yep. Right. Right.
[12:56] But the the one I'm here, he says, I
[12:59] will exalt my throne above the heights
[13:03] of the clouds. And I begin to think on
[13:06] them things. I said, "Why would he want
[13:08] to uh exalt himself above the heights of
[13:11] the cloud?" Hallelujah. Because we
[13:13] realize here that Satan knows how what
[13:16] God dwells there. Hallelujah. Satan know
[13:20] every time a cloud was manifested, God
[13:23] was on earth. Hallelujah. Satan know
[13:25] that position. Hallelujah. If you notice
[13:28] here, he said under the sixth day,
[13:31] honey, under the sixth day, God's motive
[13:34] was called in the cloud. On the seventh
[13:36] day, God spoke to him. Hallelujah. So,
[13:39] we realize here this is not hour that
[13:41] God just appear. This is the hour that
[13:43] God is speaking. Hallelujah. So, if you
[13:45] notice here on the seventh day, God
[13:47] spoke to him. Hallelujah. If you notice
[13:49] here, they they was talking in mount
[13:51] transfiguration. I knew they was talking
[13:53] about mount transfiguration. And I did
[13:55] the same day that I did God. He was
[13:58] Jesus went up a force spoke out of the
[14:00] cloud. Amen. Exactly what I
[14:05] be to take another look at the cloud. I
[14:07] kind of was when I touched this I kind
[14:09] of was teaching a little bit. Every now
[14:11] and then I get anointed to do that. So
[14:14] you know I do get anointed sometime to
[14:15] do that. So I did that. I start I said I
[14:18] said let's just look at these things
[14:19] here because we want to examine this
[14:21] real scripture. Why was Satan's motive
[14:24] to do what he was doing? Right? His
[14:26] motive was his motive was in itself. His
[14:29] desire was I will be the supreme being.
[14:33] Right. That's right. And I look here and
[14:36] he I fall in from heaven on Lucifer the
[14:40] son of the morning. How I cut down to
[14:42] the ground. That's your position. Quiet.
[14:44] What did we the nation? For I have said
[14:47] in our heart, I will ascend into heaven.
[14:50] I want that position. I will exalt
[14:52] myself above the stars of God. I will
[14:55] also be up on the side of the
[14:56] congregation
[14:58] of the congregation in the side of the
[14:59] north. I will ascend above the heights
[15:02] of the cloud. I want to be above the
[15:05] cloud. Right. Right.
[15:07] I begin to look here. I say, "Oh my god,
[15:09] we need to examine this here. Why would
[15:11] Lucifer have a desire to get this
[15:13] position?" How did I begin to look at
[15:15] her? So I begin to study this here
[15:17] because we got to realize here that
[15:19] Satan when Satan moved in this position,
[15:22] he had to have a motive behind him.
[15:24] Hallelujah. He was just not quoted. He
[15:27] was just not He was just not speaking
[15:29] words. He had a position to be above the
[15:32] clouds. Oh yeah. I began to realize
[15:35] here. So I begin to think on this thing
[15:37] here. So I begin to look into it.
[15:39] Hallelujah. So Paul in that where and we
[15:42] notice here Paul we realize Moses
[15:44] himself every exodus had a cloud right
[15:48] now every exodus a cloud was manifested
[15:51] in the time of the exodus because when
[15:53] cloud was on earth God was getting ready
[15:56] to speak so we be born when the seal was
[15:59] open what happened a cloud had to form
[16:02] itself but it was not a sign of silence
[16:04] it was a sign that God was going to
[16:06] speak
[16:08] so we begin to realize So we begin to go
[16:10] here and I looked it up in here and I
[16:12] looked it up in 1 Corinthians uh and uh
[16:16] 1 Corinthians 10 and verse one and two.
[16:18] You can write it down and Paul speaking
[16:20] here. I want you to notice here where
[16:22] Paul spoke in 1 Corinthians uh verse uh
[16:25] the 10th chapter verse 1 and two. Watch
[16:28] how Paul started this. I mean Paul said
[16:30] brother he said moreover brother I will
[16:34] not have you that ye shall be in me.
[16:36] Exactly.
[16:38] that they entered how that our fathers
[16:41] were under the curve. Honey, they was
[16:45] under the cloud and all passed through
[16:48] the the Red Sea, right? And we're all
[16:51] baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in
[16:56] the Red Sea. How was the first Exodus?
[17:00] If you notice here, he in other words
[17:02] here, he said, "How that all was
[17:04] baptized under the cloud and the Red
[17:07] Sea, right? Right. Amen. Then I took it.
[17:10] I took it here and they begin to realize
[17:12] here. So it was a it was the end of this
[17:14] time and a cloud was leading them out.
[17:17] He said, "I will not take this cloud
[17:19] from you. I cloud will follow you all
[17:21] the way to the all the way to your
[17:23] promised land." So we begin I begin to
[17:25] look here and I begin to realize here.
[17:27] So a cloud. So then we find that was the
[17:29] first Exodus. How did they come out
[17:31] under the cloud?
[17:33] Right. And I looked into the second
[17:35] exodus. Right. Right. And the second you
[17:38] find it again, there's another emptiness
[17:40] here. So the cloud can never be tuck
[17:43] away. Because every time the emptiness
[17:45] come to be a cloud because God going to
[17:48] speak from the cloud,
[17:50] it should be begin to look good. The
[17:52] second act was in St. Matthew 17. Yep.
[17:57] Right. Captain, I look at here another
[18:00] crown experience. Right. And the and I
[18:03] want to read the fifth verse and it says
[18:06] yet he spoke
[18:09] a bright light a bright cloud excuse me
[18:13] a as he spoke a bright cloud right and
[18:18] overshadowed them and behold a voice
[18:22] Amen sing
[18:24] a voice that's right brother he said
[18:27] behold a voice out of the cloud which
[18:30] which said just as My beloved son and to
[18:33] whom I am well pleased here in him.
[18:37] Hallel sure there was a voice in the
[18:38] cloud. Hallelujah. That was the that was
[18:40] the second that was the second coming
[18:43] out. They were still under the cloud.
[18:45] Right. The last and the third where we
[18:49] are right now. So God started off with a
[18:53] in the first and the first it was
[18:55] associating itself with a cow. Lucifer
[18:58] wanted this position. Hallelujah. In
[19:00] other words, if the first activist and
[19:02] the second emptiness had a cloud, the
[19:05] third activist must be associated with a
[19:07] cloud.
[19:08] That's right. So, I found it again. And
[19:11] I want you to notice this here.
[19:14] I tell first Corinthians
[19:17] uh 102.
[19:19] And Paul repeats the same thing twice.
[19:22] Yeah. And he says at the beginning of I
[19:26] will help you. I will not that ye should
[19:29] be in you. Right. Right. Then he goes to
[19:32] the uh the third Exodus. Paul quoted it
[19:37] again. Paul said it again the same word.
[19:41] But I would not. That's 1 Thessalonians
[19:44] 4 verse 13. Right. He said, "But I would
[19:46] not have they to be in it, right?
[19:49] Concerning them which are asleep." Amen.
[19:53] That they shall sorrow not even as
[19:57] others which have no hope. That word
[20:01] hope does not mean, hallelujah, I hope
[20:04] that God coming. I hope I'm going to be
[20:06] changed. That word when you break it
[20:08] down, that word hope means expectation.
[20:11] I would not have you to be in. I would
[20:14] not have you. I would not have you which
[20:16] have no hope, no expectation. The world
[20:19] ain't looking for this. Amen. That's
[20:22] right. Hallelujah. But people that look
[20:24] is under expectation. Hallelujah. For a
[20:27] change of the body. Amen. That's right.
[20:29] Yes, sir. Then in the 17th verse, what I
[20:32] want to put put your emphasis on this
[20:35] crowd right here. in the 17th verse 8
[20:37] for we which are alive and remain right
[20:42] shall be called up exodus we moving into
[20:45] the rapture so that something got to
[20:47] take place on earth we moving into
[20:49] another dispensation the changing of the
[20:52] body that we with the latter remain
[20:54] shall not shall be called up together
[20:57] with them in the clouds
[21:02] in the cloud to meet the Lord in the
[21:04] airmen Amen. So shall we be with the
[21:07] Lord. Hallelujah. I believe forever and
[21:11] ever and ever.
[21:13] Hallelujah. That one in that position
[21:16] because he know when God sent a cloud.
[21:18] Right. Right. Okay. It's over. Amen. He
[21:21] know that this is the last age. So if
[21:24] you notice when the cloud appeared under
[21:26] when he came back on the on the sunset
[21:28] mountain and the cloud came down, what
[21:30] did Satan do? Immediately he tore the
[21:32] pin off him. Right. Amen. He know that
[21:36] this is the hour for the change. That's
[21:38] why your battles are harder now than it
[21:40] was 20 years ago. He know right now when
[21:43] the government he the devil knew when
[21:45] this crowd appeared. He knew that it's
[21:47] time for exodus and his job hand
[21:52] the third activist. Right? He knew when
[21:54] he was getting ready to be changed. So
[21:56] now his technique got to change because
[21:58] he know he trying to hold position.
[22:01] Right. He's trying to hold position. And
[22:03] another place I'm going to look at, he
[22:05] said he also uh
[22:08] he wanted a position that was not his.
[22:12] That's right. That has been his whole
[22:13] desire. He wanted a position to him
[22:17] that's not his. That's his whole motive
[22:19] for he's quoting in Isaiah 14. Isaiah 12
[22:23] and verse 14. That was his whole motive
[22:25] was he want to gain this position of his
[22:28] power. He want to rule God and man,
[22:31] right? How you know he want to rule God?
[22:33] Because when he came in Matthew 4, what
[22:35] did he tell Jesus? If you p out and what
[22:39] you mean. He was wanting the position
[22:42] that Christ had. So he was trying to get
[22:44] Christ to get him the power to go into
[22:47] it. Exactly. So we begin to I'm going to
[22:51] get your Bible. I'm going to hold this
[22:53] scripture for me. Uh uh I'm going to uh
[22:57] uh excuse me. Psalms 48:2. Just hold
[23:00] that real quick. In other words, but he
[23:02] wanted his position. And the position he
[23:05] wanted, he wanted to be above the
[23:07] heights of the cloud. And he wanted the
[23:11] size of the north. Amen. Right. He had a
[23:15] reason for wanting that side over there.
[23:17] Oh yeah. He did not come to his mind and
[23:21] he just quoted out of out of context.
[23:24] When he quoted, he was wanting his
[23:26] position. Why you the son of the north?
[23:29] Right. Exactly. And brother way, read
[23:31] that real quick. Let's read verse one.
[23:33] Yeah. Read. Go. Read verse one. Great is
[23:35] the Lord and greatly to be praised in
[23:37] the city of our God in the mountain of
[23:39] his holiness. Beautiful for situation.
[23:41] The joy of the whole earth is Mount Zion
[23:45] on the sides of the north. The city of
[23:48] the great king. He did not make a
[23:51] mistake with his position. He know where
[23:54] he was. He know where God dwell in.
[23:57] Hallelujah. Go himself and the two of
[24:00] brother. He will come now and fight
[24:01] against us. How do he know that position
[24:04] right there? How do he know where God
[24:06] dwell in the sides of the north, the
[24:09] city of the great king? And because he's
[24:11] here, he going to exile himself back to
[24:13] that position. How many show?
[24:18] How's he going to do it? He got to do
[24:20] it. How's he going to hold his position?
[24:22] How he's going to hold his position?
[24:24] That's the question right here. How is
[24:26] Satan going to hold his position? Right.
[24:27] Right. I want to read a here it was
[24:30] here. He wanted to rule. He also he
[24:34] wanted the place of God dwell in. And in
[24:38] other words, he wanted the sons of God
[24:40] position. I'm going to exalt myself
[24:42] above the sons of God. Hallelujah. In
[24:45] other words, how would I do this? Right?
[24:47] That's the question. How is he going to
[24:50] exalt himself above the sons of God? The
[24:52] only way that Satan ever exalt himself
[24:56] above the sons of God, he got to keep us
[24:59] under the gloom of worshiping him.
[25:02] Exactly. Hallelujah. He keep us in
[25:05] captivity. Hallelujah. Or keeping us
[25:08] under the gloom of worshiping him. He
[25:11] have exalted himself above the son of
[25:13] God. And I took a quote from the message
[25:17] of Christ the mystery of God revealed.
[25:20] I'm going to read you a real quote real
[25:21] quick. And he says, "Watch how he held
[25:25] the churches, how he held the people
[25:27] back from the presence of God." He had a
[25:30] motive in what he was doing. How do you
[25:32] know? Because opposition in Christ is
[25:34] opposition when the cloud come is the
[25:36] bride is to be lifted up into a rapture.
[25:39] Hallelujah. So we find in the feast of
[25:40] the trumpet and page 39. He said at the
[25:44] same time as soon as as soon
[25:48] as soon as this church the bride is
[25:51] drawn together right she will be taken
[25:55] up in the mystery of the seven seal or
[25:59] the seven seal the mystery a going. So
[26:03] he's putting it he linking it to the
[26:06] revelation when the seven seals mission
[26:08] come on earth and he embraced the
[26:10] revelation to the bride and the bride is
[26:13] already start
[26:16] the rapture don't start just 20 year way
[26:20] back here when you hear the message and
[26:21] they call your name you already start a
[26:24] s
[26:25] you already starting the rapture
[26:29] shall begin to go there so his job is
[26:31] the whole y the god reveal. He got to
[26:34] find a way to keep the sons of God from
[26:36] gaining their position back because God
[26:39] put us in a he called us to a rapture
[26:41] position and the rapture position in his
[26:44] head is heavenly places in Christ Jes.
[26:49] We've been living below privileges. We
[26:52] still think we still living earthly, but
[26:54] we ought to be starting to change
[26:55] heavenly
[26:57] way. So he then he he taxed the people
[27:00] and he taxed them this way under this he
[27:04] was using the trinitarian. He said
[27:07] therefore
[27:09] if any trinity we just let you loose a
[27:14] minute just he just just let yourself
[27:16] loose. Basically what he said he you
[27:17] just let yourself loose. Amen. You can
[27:20] see that father son and holy ghost is
[27:24] the three gods. There are three
[27:28] attributes of the same God. In other
[27:30] words, every man will try to bring you
[27:32] back and bring you in bondage by start
[27:35] breaking God up. Hallel make him two and
[27:39] three instead of one. Hallelujah. So the
[27:42] same God and three attributes.
[27:45] And is his expression he was he was
[27:50] wanted to be a father. He wanted to be a
[27:52] son. He wanted to be the Holy Ghost. The
[27:55] father, the and the father and the son
[27:57] and the holy ghost is the same self
[27:59] spirit.
[28:01] Single, not plural. And do not do now.
[28:04] You see this? You get it? You get it?
[28:07] Now, now three gods, not three gods. The
[28:10] devil told you told you them things to
[28:15] make an idolatry out of you. What was he
[28:19] doing? He was stopping the peoples from
[28:22] just ascending up by making them into
[28:25] idolatry. Right. As long as you on the
[28:28] earth, as long as you stay in this
[28:30] realm, Satan got a hold on you. Exactly.
[28:33] That's right. Satan got a hold on you.
[28:36] He knows that. So what he knew, he had
[28:38] to that was that they would repand quote
[28:40] that. I just say maybe he was speaking
[28:42] to a lot of Pentecostals and a lot of
[28:44] Pentecostal didn't understand what was
[28:46] going on. But we got to ascend up
[28:48] because Satan know if I can keep the
[28:50] people down here in this realm I need.
[28:52] But he don't fight the people in this
[28:54] realm right here. He don't fight us with
[28:56] trinitary doctors. He fight us against
[28:59] the power that God is the same.
[29:02] He he know if the people get the same
[29:05] revelation of the same God as the earth
[29:08] and what 2,000 years ago and he can do
[29:11] the greater work.
[29:14] He's not crazy. How do he know we ever
[29:17] get the same revelation? He know
[29:18] something going to take place. How he
[29:20] know something going to take place. So
[29:22] when it is good, you said, "Brother,
[29:24] we've been around this message a long
[29:25] time. I've been around for years, 30
[29:27] years by God grace." And I'm going to
[29:29] tell you what, it's time for something
[29:30] to take place. How kind of living this
[29:33] living?
[29:36] But Satan know if they can get the
[29:38] people away from the power of God.
[29:40] Right. That's right. See people took
[29:43] message and they broke down all they
[29:45] took message and took the power out of
[29:47] it. Right. So now they got to tell
[29:49] people if the word enter the word in the
[29:52] word in the worship if if there if
[29:55] there's word if that's word that power
[29:57] to follow this message how there's a
[29:59] power mark 16 a promise of God how to
[30:03] follow this message right amen but Satan
[30:05] says here so now we're talking message
[30:08] terminology see the way he tack the
[30:10] message people
[30:12] he holds page Christ the god reveal page
[30:16] 34 four he said he said if a man says
[30:20] he's born again in other words if a man
[30:23] says he's born again he is saying I am
[30:26] called up in the mystery of the seventh
[30:29] seal because that is the pray that is
[30:31] the revelation of your new birth for
[30:33] this day when you recognize this message
[30:35] being eagle fool you are called up
[30:39] tell you if a man says he's born again
[30:42] and tried to place the promise of Christ
[30:44] in the last day to Somebody making the
[30:48] price yesterday. Everybody you go around
[30:51] the message of 5 years ago and still
[30:53] people trapped in yesterday revelation.
[30:56] How some people I believe that that
[30:57] didn't was a lap over they just didn't
[30:59] turn the corner and they still trapped
[31:01] in yesterday revelation. Hallelujah. But
[31:04] yesterday man won't work for today.
[31:06] Hallelujah. Because we are not leading.
[31:07] We not we are not on the man of the
[31:09] church. We on the old corn that same
[31:12] accord and fell in the beginning and
[31:14] back again. the grave that they done
[31:16] come through the castle and shack in the
[31:18] sea again. It's not your time. That's
[31:21] right. That's right, brother.
[31:22] Hallelujah. You're making him Christ
[31:24] yesterday but not today. That man or
[31:27] that person has been in a delusion.
[31:30] Right. That's right. How worthy to in a
[31:34] delusion. Yes, sir. You never had a
[31:36] delusion. Anybody ever had a a delusion?
[31:40] I have had one before. About years ago,
[31:43] I had a delusion during a purple micro
[31:46] dot. I don't know if some of you might
[31:47] know what it is, but I did. I had a
[31:49] delusion. And when I was when I was on
[31:51] this thing right here on the purple mic
[31:53] of God, I knew every person that I had
[31:55] died that I know. I would look at the
[31:58] wall and they start appearing on the
[32:00] wall. That's a delusion. Yeah. I'm about
[32:02] to freak out, man. Cuz people that I
[32:05] knew they had died and I'm looking at
[32:07] this wall and all of a sudden that
[32:09] person begin to materialize. I said,
[32:10] "What it was?" It was I had broken into
[32:13] the dimension of the region of the law
[32:15] because people most of them were drug
[32:16] addicted like I was when I broke down se
[32:20] I'm living the wall and the people
[32:21] facing appear on the wall man I'm about
[32:23] to go out of my mind
[32:26] and Satan keep you
[32:30] turn the corner
[32:32] get your get you looking at the flesh of
[32:34] real grate
[32:45] Glory.
[32:46] He trying to get the people to look to
[32:48] the word.
[32:49] Did not come to lift himself up because
[32:52] would lift himself up. He would have had
[32:53] to take the place of God. I didn't know
[32:56] why he said I had to I had to decrease
[32:59] so Christ can increase. What is the
[33:01] word? The Bible become a new book.
[33:04] That's right. I'm trying to make you
[33:05] living in the boom. Right. Yeah. He said
[33:10] he said that person there and he said
[33:13] then that man or that person has been in
[33:16] an illusion by Satan. Yep. And if that
[33:18] man says that he believe
[33:22] that and it does not manifest itself
[33:25] through him, right? Jesus said in Mark
[33:28] 16, he said follow them that believe
[33:32] into all the world. Oh my to every edge
[33:36] casting out devils.
[33:39] Not so much you have to lay hands on him
[33:41] but every time you preach truth you
[33:44] casting out devil.
[33:46] Because realize as you cutting the sin
[33:49] up a sin up your revelation and bringing
[33:52] the devil down.
[33:54] Amen. Hallelujah. We in the age we're in
[33:57] the age of finding out who we are. So I
[33:59] begin to realize here in this message is
[34:01] only it ain't one way this message ain't
[34:04] one way for this message here. This
[34:06] message is not to be going backwards,
[34:08] right? You don't start up here, brother
[34:10] C and fall back to faith. Honey, that is
[34:13] the wrong revelation. How if you notice
[34:16] the pyramid is turning you to a
[34:18] countdown and at the end of the day
[34:20] going to be a blasto
[34:25] going realize. So are you beginning to
[34:26] realize how we going to be called up in
[34:28] this message? How we going to be
[34:30] ascending? How we going to ascend up?
[34:31] Hallelujah. How is we going to get to
[34:33] that place? I understand. See what it is
[34:36] people we got to realize that the
[34:37] message itself is not just a book is a
[34:39] faith and a revelation. How do you know
[34:42] why he said the rapture is a revelation?
[34:44] How many people say well brother Joe I
[34:46] got saved? How do I believe God? How
[34:48] many know you hold on to your revelation
[34:50] or your confession you saved? Right.
[34:52] Come on. Exactly. It's just that simple.
[34:56] How many of the time people just only
[34:57] save for week to week just like a
[35:00] paycheck. And when you ain't paid you
[35:02] ain't save. We get paid. Hallelujah.
[35:07] But there it is. How we going to get in
[35:09] this real? How we going to get to the
[35:10] place of ascending up to? Hallelujah. We
[35:13] begin to realize here in the silver book
[35:15] on page the old se on page 128. He begin
[35:19] to explain that. He said there is coming
[35:21] seven mysterious thunders.
[35:24] That what those the people are. That's
[35:26] right, brother. Amen. That word right
[35:28] there. Seven mysterious thunders. Yeah.
[35:31] Those the people are. Yeah. Because now
[35:34] men have got a clue that they can tap
[35:36] into this and take the position of God
[35:38] that leaves that open door for
[35:40] impersonation
[35:41] because before the way that there seven
[35:44] mysterious thunder when he did the men
[35:46] begin to realize I'm the one I'm one of
[35:48] them. I'm the one to take the book and
[35:50] do this. I'm the one to do that. What he
[35:51] did left a little open for
[35:53] impersonation. Right. Exactly.
[35:57] He come and sell mysterious thunder
[35:59] that's not even written at all. Right. I
[36:02] was looking at this a while back. The
[36:03] Holy Spirit inspired me. I went back and
[36:06] checked with the message. What was not
[36:08] written? Yeah. When we realized it was
[36:12] John was writing the book and he came to
[36:14] the thunders and he said, "Sill up those
[36:17] seven thunders
[36:19] not." Right? Write those not even write
[36:22] a jerk. Right. What did he reveal? He
[36:26] did not reveal the vessel, right? He did
[36:30] not tell who the vessel was, but he gave
[36:33] one clue in the day of the voice of the
[36:37] seven angels. When he shall begin to
[36:40] sound, my sea went wrong on earth. That
[36:44] was a spiritual side of the people. He
[36:47] didn't reveal a vessel, right? Neither
[36:50] did he reveal John the Baptist. All they
[36:53] had the voice of one crying in the
[36:55] wilderness. They read that over and
[36:56] over, but he didn't say this is John.
[36:59] No, because the devil would have got
[37:01] really went on the wrong place. He would
[37:02] impersonate this man. He would not need
[37:04] no impersonation. But when John walked
[37:06] that day and he declared the scripture
[37:09] for his day, I am the voice of one cry
[37:12] in the wilderness. That was the thunder.
[37:18] Amen. Blessing. Hallelujah. He says, not
[37:22] even written at all. That's right. And I
[37:25] believe that through those seven
[37:27] thunders will be revealed in the last
[37:30] day in order to gather the bride
[37:33] together for rapture.
[37:37] Rapturion faith. Amen. Exactly. What we
[37:39] ain't You say, "Brother Julie, I I I
[37:43] need it. I I got to have it." You You
[37:45] keep laying in the word is in you.
[37:46] Right. Right. How do you Don't try to be
[37:48] come mysterious. Just let the word run
[37:50] it. Say amen to every word of God. How
[37:54] do you praise God for what he does? And
[37:56] that word that's on the inside of you.
[37:58] As you lay in the word, you become the
[38:00] word. Hallelujah. As you eat the book,
[38:02] you become the
[38:04] He what we got now, right now, it won't
[38:08] do it. It won't be able to do it. But
[38:11] there is something that has got to step
[38:14] forward, right? For we cannot even have
[38:16] faith for divine healing.
[38:19] We have not got we got to have faith
[38:22] enough to be changed in a moment to the
[38:26] to be swept up out of this earth. So he
[38:29] said what we got right now. He said
[38:31] we're not doing it. He said but we got
[38:33] to have faith to be swept off of this
[38:36] earth. Hallelujah. Anyway, there going
[38:38] to be something to come for to put a
[38:40] faith in you. And only way you can have
[38:43] perfect faith, you got to have perfect
[38:44] word.
[38:46] Honey, because you cannot look at
[38:47] nothing else but God word. And if God li
[38:50] he's not God
[38:52] show you another word. So we couldn't
[38:54] really hold on to the word of God
[38:56] because there's so many services, so
[38:57] many denominations, so many ideas inject
[39:00] it into the message.
[39:03] I say injected into the message. You
[39:04] know why they get them false? Because
[39:06] they cannot produce it in the Bible. If
[39:09] you don't say what the Bible say, then
[39:11] you need to get rid of your revelation.
[39:13] Yeah. If you cannot prove that Jesus
[39:15] Christ is the same from Genesis to
[39:17] revelation, you have got the wrong
[39:18] revelation. This message is not proven
[39:22] or this message is not just a quote.
[39:24] That's right. This message is a Bible
[39:26] and become a new book. That's right.
[39:29] Amen. Got that. That's all you know. And
[39:31] that's what we did. But Satan knows
[39:35] I would exalt myself above the stars of
[39:39] God.
[39:40] In other words, so Satan job is to exalt
[39:44] himself
[39:46] himself. I will
[39:49] I will I will be like God. And the
[39:52] people on earth, they going to praise me
[39:54] like God. Every time you see him, how
[39:56] you feel? But I'm still sick.
[39:59] Wy.
[40:02] Hallelujah. Brother Sam, I'm blame. I'm
[40:05] going to die. The devil said keep on
[40:07] praising me. Hallelujah. You won't give
[40:08] up in the name of how you talk about how
[40:11] dirty, how low down, how sick you are.
[40:14] How no good you are. How you just keep
[40:16] saying the word. How you speaking the
[40:17] devil language.
[40:19] Oh, I'm not going to be healed. I I
[40:22] didn't believe God so long. It ain't
[40:24] nothing happen. You are talking the
[40:26] devil language. Honey, you are getting
[40:28] you are giving the devil to take the
[40:30] place of God. Honey, you are say I
[40:33] believe my mind is leaving me. I don't
[40:35] know. I'm going to clean. You are
[40:36] talking the devil ain't but if you say
[40:38] by his strength by his word I am he sent
[40:42] his word and his word heal me.
[40:50] Hallelujah. Send his word and his word
[40:52] heal me. So we at we at the end right
[40:55] here. This is not a time. It's a time
[40:57] that we got to come to send up. And the
[41:00] cond I mean ascending up does not start
[41:03] hallelujah years away. But when you come
[41:06] into the message the first thing you got
[41:08] to start condescending you got to start
[41:10] taking control of your own emotion.
[41:12] Right. Come on. Right. The biggest
[41:15] people bless is in this and Satan job is
[41:18] to hold you earthbound. Right. His job
[41:21] is to hold you earthbound. As long as he
[41:25] got you earthbound. How about he say a
[41:28] message like this? He said the peoples
[41:30] of God are not mature minded.
[41:34] He said they are spiritual minded. And
[41:36] the reason he said there's nothing wrong
[41:38] with God blessing you. People preach
[41:39] that out in the message too. Well, we
[41:41] got to let Jehovah so broke. I don't
[41:44] want
[41:46] I'm selling this poor broke Jehovah. I
[41:49] don't need some God. Ain't God wy.
[41:53] I be I be he bankrupt. No, he ain't
[41:56] bankrupt. You just face rough.
[42:00] Even
[42:02] God a had no children that God ain't
[42:04] provided for. Honey, when they when they
[42:06] went down to Egypt, hallelujah, Jacob
[42:08] was back there and they had cut off the
[42:10] supply and all there a famine in the
[42:13] land. But I want to let you know, why
[42:15] did Jacob have all that money?
[42:18] And God took it. Hallelujah. We we we
[42:21] serve God. Oh man,
[42:24] I'm so humble. God can bless me with a
[42:27] Chevrolet.
[42:28] [Music]
[42:36] If you want to be with a for that's up
[42:38] to you.
[42:41] I leave that alone. I leave that.
[42:45] I preach that in one church. Everybody
[42:47] in the whole church for I said it. They
[42:50] went flat. Brother said, "Bro, don't
[42:52] never speak for every man." But you know
[42:55] I said but I got great I got one guy I
[42:57] preach Hallelujah. I said I drive a
[42:58] Chevrolet. He said well I drive a Ram. I
[43:01] said well I tell you what brother I said
[43:02] I'll let you know right now Chevrolet
[43:04] mean grace. He let you know that ram
[43:06] mean created power because when Abraham
[43:08] need a ram God
[43:17] I get
[43:19] I get with you know he'll be with God.
[43:22] He got we got to take our position.
[43:24] Satan knows. That's it. Why you think
[43:27] brother make that statement so blank in
[43:29] the church page 1650? Satan knows right.
[43:33] Yep. If the people ever get this
[43:35] revelation
[43:37] of the two spirits working in the
[43:39] framework of the Christian church
[43:42] and withstanded by God's spirit brother
[43:45] that he would become her in she would
[43:48] become an invisible army. That word mean
[43:51] unconquerable once you realize the words
[43:53] of Satan and we did not realize the
[43:55] words of Satan in the church. But when
[43:57] the seals out there and showed you the
[44:00] white Amen. Exactly. He never quit from
[44:02] there. He just showed you to somebody
[44:04] that he was still doing the same way.
[44:06] And you look at the seals it ought to
[44:08] reveal him what he doing because the
[44:10] devil did not change his ministry and
[44:12] then he knew God change his ministry.
[44:14] Right. Glory. Right. Blessing.
[44:18] ministry in the last day that Satan
[44:19] would always exalt your flesh. Right.
[44:23] God would always exalt the word.
[44:26] Hallelujah. I love saying the other day,
[44:28] it ain't about flesh. It's about the
[44:29] word. How about David say, "Lord, I hid
[44:31] the word in my heart." The word was not
[44:34] the word was still there. Satan had kept
[44:36] control of the flesh, but he never got
[44:38] control of the word. And Peter, Satan
[44:41] took control of his flesh, but he said,
[44:43] "Peter, I pray for your faith." That's
[44:46] right. Hallelujah. We all done made
[44:48] mistakes. Hallelujah. In other words, we
[44:51] all done made mistakes. But the point of
[44:52] it, we got to realize here his his
[44:54] position is to exalt himself above above
[44:58] the stars of God to hold us on earth.
[45:02] Right. That's it. And I was looking at
[45:05] that and I was wondering why Satan would
[45:09] want to hold us up on the earth. M yeah.
[45:11] You know, I started thinking that why
[45:13] would he be on a horse
[45:16] earthbound, right? Yeah. You know, I
[45:18] begin to look at that, but I said, but
[45:20] really the reasoning, how you going to
[45:22] do it now? Because we're not in the
[45:24] change of the body. So, he say if I can
[45:26] keep war against their minds, war
[45:28] against their flesh. Hallelu. You know,
[45:31] everybody want to you feel holy. You
[45:33] make a mistake and then Satan will pull
[45:35] that mistake up and he can show you that
[45:36] thing over and over and over and the
[45:39] next thing you know you just said, "I
[45:41] just I just can't do it." And you
[45:43] talking his language. Hallelujah.
[45:44] Because if a man can't do it, he lay
[45:46] down his well. He quit fighting.
[45:48] Hallelujah. It ain't a time to give up
[45:50] your time to keep fighting. Hallel get
[45:53] right back up. I have more than a con.
[45:56] You got to look at that. Me and me and
[45:59] me and brother Z he he like boxing. I
[46:02] like boxing. I just love boxing.
[46:06] But I ain't eat boxing no more fight
[46:08] still fighting the devil. Amen. I quit
[46:11] beating up flesh and start fighting
[46:12] against prison. But I do love boxing and
[46:15] one of my like we talking about we start
[46:16] looking at all the rest of these
[46:18] fighters that be coming on and on. But I
[46:19] still out of all of them Muhammad Ali
[46:21] still the best.
[46:23] Muhammad Ali still the best. I don't
[46:25] care how you could that Muhammad Ali was
[46:27] the best. Muhammad Ali was able to
[46:29] convince you that he was the best. He
[46:31] was the devil can ever convince you that
[46:34] he more greater than God. He's the best.
[46:37] God convince you. I am greater than God.
[46:46] So how do we start ascending up here in
[46:49] this realm that we in? Cuz we got we got
[46:51] to start here order to go there, right?
[46:54] In order for us to do it, let us let us
[46:56] look at a scripture.
[46:58] Let us look at this scripture real. I'm
[46:59] going to read from 2 Corinthians the
[47:02] 10th chapter.
[47:09] Time to start ascending up. Amen. Right.
[47:15] Second Corinthians. Yeah.
[47:20] Second Corinthians the 10th chapter.
[47:22] It's time to move up. Amen. In order as
[47:25] we begin to move up uh let me let me let
[47:29] me start reading at verse
[47:33] read all the way down to uh verse 8.
[47:36] Brother way read for me starting at
[47:38] verse starting in uh yeah verse three.
[47:45] For though we walk in the flesh, we do
[47:47] not war after the flesh. For the weapons
[47:51] of our warfare are not carnal, but
[47:54] mighty through God to the pulling down
[47:56] of stronghold. To do what? To pull down
[48:00] stronghold. Amen. Honey, everybody got a
[48:02] different stronghold. Everybody's
[48:04] genetic makeup is different. Honey, some
[48:07] people had a grandmother that was real
[48:09] nervous. That was a stronghold. And it's
[48:11] handed down genetic. Right? So now you
[48:14] find that sister, she grows up, she
[48:16] become real nervous. I let the devil use
[48:18] that nervous weakness to work on her day
[48:21] and night or work on him day and night.
[48:23] Making her think that she going to lose
[48:24] her life, making her think she ain't
[48:26] going to be good enough. That is nothing
[48:27] but a stronghold. Whatever you do, you
[48:30] got to take God word and pour that thing
[48:32] out. Exactly. Right. Amen.
[48:37] Casting down imaginations
[48:40] and every high thing that exaltth itself
[48:43] against the knowledge of God. Casting
[48:46] down imagination. Amen. If I can get rid
[48:49] of get my imagination and everything
[48:52] under the under under the altar of God's
[48:54] word, I can overcome. The heavenly
[48:58] things are war with is the imagination.
[49:00] And the imagination uh you know your
[49:02] imagination run away with you when you
[49:04] do hunt. Oh yeah.
[49:07] One thing about imagination brother said
[49:09] when you do imagination be playing with
[49:11] you.
[49:15] You lay in bed at night and you think
[49:17] high going to walk out the next day and
[49:19] you'll be standing right there. When you
[49:21] get there
[49:26] I see myself the best dirt head I had
[49:28] was yesterday when I was scratching out
[49:30] on that c.
[49:34] I had to do exactly what I wanted and
[49:36] somebody woke me up.
[49:44] Cast that down. Casting down imagination
[49:47] not and every high thing that exalted
[49:50] itself against the knowledge of God and
[49:53] bringing into captivity every thought to
[49:55] the obedience of Christ. Hallelujah.
[49:58] Have a thought. Yep. and having in a in
[50:02] a readiness to revenge all disobedience.
[50:06] Oh, when your obedience is fulfilled.
[50:09] Hallelujah. Yes, sir. Do you do you look
[50:13] on things after the outward appearance?
[50:15] If any man trust to himself that he is
[50:18] Christ, let him of himself think this
[50:20] again, that as he is Christ, even so are
[50:24] we. Amen. Amen. Okay. For though I
[50:27] should boast somewhat more of our
[50:30] authority, which the Lord hath given us
[50:33] for edification,
[50:36] and not for your destruction, I should
[50:38] not be ashamed. Amen. I Paul word is
[50:41] clear. Absolutely. So, I hope you
[50:43] understand something about Paul. Well,
[50:44] Paul would believe at a rapture, right?
[50:48] Paul literally taught a rapture. Right.
[50:52] If you notice in first lawyer when Paul
[50:55] was teaching Paul did not put as he put
[50:58] as we
[51:00] he saw himself on that rapture.
[51:02] Hallelujah. His faith believed that God
[51:05] going to change our bodies.
[51:08] But God knew that something was still
[51:10] not happening. Right. So he was he was
[51:12] singing under the wisdom of God. I would
[51:14] pray God that you will open to us a door
[51:16] utterance. Right? I mean he wanted to he
[51:19] wanted to make known this great
[51:20] revelation that was going on in but it
[51:22] was not for his name but he looked
[51:25] forward to heaven we went to sh
[51:30] he believed in rapture right he looked
[51:33] forward to the rapture right but then it
[51:35] was not time for him to he said it was
[51:37] our day right so the way it had to be in
[51:40] continuity at the seven at the seven
[51:43] when Moses went up on the mount sixth
[51:44] day on the seventh day the voice of God
[51:46] spoke Hallelujah. We find here and we
[51:49] find here that we had to go through six
[51:51] church year and after the end of the
[51:53] sixth church, the voice of God in the
[51:56] day of the voice
[51:58] by the time rapture. Right. Right. Amen.
[52:01] So we begin to look at him. So what he
[52:03] was doing, he was here. We found that
[52:05] Revelation 3 was the church ages and
[52:08] then Revelation 3 was the church ages.
[52:10] And we find out that Revelation 4 was a
[52:13] rapture day. The bride was caught up in
[52:16] a great mystery of the word.
[52:19] The devil can't stop that. Amen. He
[52:21] can't do nothing when we caught up in
[52:23] them. So I begin to realize here why the
[52:25] devil struggling with the bride going
[52:27] up. That's the That's the problem. Yeah.
[52:31] He's been declaring this position.
[52:33] That's right. For a long time. Come on,
[52:35] brother. Oh, yeah. That's right. He
[52:36] declaring this position and unwillingly
[52:40] and ignorantly we'll be letting him have
[52:43] it. Right. Right. That's it. He to do
[52:45] his job, his best to keep us on earth.
[52:49] Right. His job is to keep us from the
[52:52] rapture.
[52:54] He knows that. Amen. So he said, "I'm
[52:56] going to work on them all day long. I
[52:58] know how I fall from heaven on Lucifer.
[53:01] He's the son of the morning. How I cut
[53:03] down to the ground with weaken the
[53:04] nation. For thou has sent in the heart.
[53:07] I will send into heaven. I will exalt my
[53:09] throne. How we going to get exalt? Cast
[53:11] down every imagination that exalts. How
[53:14] do you have imagination that exalt?
[53:16] Because anything that will try to go
[53:17] against the knowledge of God is the
[53:19] devil. However, two spirits in the world
[53:21] is either Christ or the devil. And I
[53:24] will exalt my knowledge.
[53:26] And I will exalt I will exalt my exalt
[53:30] my throne. Yep. Above the stars of God.
[53:32] Y I will set also up in the mouth of the
[53:35] congregation in the sides of the north.
[53:37] I will descend above the heights of the
[53:39] cloud. I will be like the most high. I
[53:42] want God position. I want the bride
[53:44] position. I what what I'm going to do,
[53:47] I'm going to keep working on them. I'm
[53:48] going to keep fighting them. I'm going
[53:50] to keep them from the rapture. Right.
[53:52] Come on. Now, we got to find out why he
[53:54] want to fight us and keep us out of this
[53:55] rapture. We go. We got to come to it
[53:57] somewhere. We got that somewhere in the
[54:00] in the ch somewhere in the dispensation,
[54:02] there got to be a change in our body.
[54:04] Halleluture promise. And not only do we
[54:06] got a rapture, brother, we got to go to
[54:08] a wedding supper and three and a half
[54:10] year whenever return back and Revelation
[54:13] 19 as King of Kings. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[54:17] He knew if the bride ever recognized his
[54:19] position, right? He's done. It going to
[54:21] be done. That's right. He is fighting us
[54:24] for recognized opposition. Right. Right.
[54:27] And God positionally placed us in the
[54:29] word. Right. Right. You say you put that
[54:32] you know he put us right in heavenly
[54:34] places in my so you know when you say
[54:37] what heavenly places a heavenly
[54:39] atmosphere a heavenly realm how we
[54:41] called up into another realm you know
[54:44] you know well
[54:47] said when the seven church is the bride
[54:49] is called up in the br we left the
[54:51] church we not we still lay on seal but
[54:53] what he did then the mind of God have
[54:55] come down we thinking like God now
[54:59] He did. He br he to the revelation of
[55:02] the vine. If you notice here, he come
[55:05] back with the head this time. Right? He
[55:08] walked on earth with the body, right?
[55:09] Hallelujah. This time he come, he walk
[55:11] on the blood on earth with the body
[55:12] because in that body was redemption
[55:14] power. Hallelujah. But in other words,
[55:16] we accept the blood of Jesus Christ. But
[55:18] now it's time to come back with the
[55:20] intelligence cuz now there got to not
[55:22] just be one body rapture. There got to
[55:24] be a universal rapture. How did they
[55:26] start right here? So now he come back
[55:28] with the mine edge and the bride is
[55:30] called up not in not in the foot but in
[55:33] the mind of God. Amen. And he said then
[55:36] let this mind be in you that was in
[55:38] Christ. Count it not robbery to come to
[55:41] the same revelation.
[55:43] One thing come to the same revelation
[55:46] that Jesus had. Hallel come to the same
[55:49] revelation of counting robbery that we
[55:52] call evil with God.
[55:54] How you know? We're going to live with
[55:55] one Holy Ghost and that day you will
[55:57] know that I am in the father. The father
[55:59] me and I are in you. He put the same
[56:01] revelation. So we got to come to the
[56:03] revelation. We got to cover the devil
[56:04] the same way that Jesus come. Exactly.
[56:07] What was Jesus final victory over the
[56:09] devil?
[56:11] His final victory was in Acts one. I
[56:14] believe verse 9. When he stood there, he
[56:17] says over there. Yeah. And all of a
[56:20] sudden he was standing there and the
[56:21] Bible said cloud right. Hallelujah. He
[56:25] was caught up and a crowd come up and it
[56:28] took him off. But he would not find a
[56:30] victory over the devil. He said we would
[56:32] remain shall be chain in a moment and a
[56:36] fire going to come down. Right.
[56:40] He car.
[56:42] Yes sir. Hallelujah. We It's over there.
[56:45] Hallelujah. Yeah. But the devil job is
[56:48] to keep keep you out of the rapture. Oh
[56:50] yeah. And I begin to look at this. I'm
[56:52] living in a message. Find first seal. We
[56:55] did find it. Found it. First seal. It
[56:57] was in the seal. He said he said nine.
[57:00] First seal. And he said, "Now uh
[57:06] page notice page." He said the first he
[57:08] said now, he said, "Now notice at the
[57:11] end time and at the end of of the church
[57:15] now he is called.
[57:18] He is called
[57:21] to and yeah his calling and his
[57:26] childrens are called the antichrist
[57:29] and everything that's against Christ is
[57:32] antichrist and and anything that against
[57:36] the word is antichrist
[57:38] because Christ is the word
[57:42] you put it is not a person he's the word
[57:45] hallelujah his
[57:47] his flesh become the word and the word
[57:49] become flesh. Hallelujah. So where he
[57:52] was not born by sexual desire, he come
[57:55] into a body that was untangled by
[57:57] untouched by man. Even though he had sin
[57:59] come on him through the eating and all
[58:01] the things, he was able to fill him over
[58:02] there. But by the same token, he had the
[58:05] power in him to raise the same body.
[58:09] Yes, sir. Ain't no man never had that
[58:11] kind of faith. Let him die and raise it
[58:13] up. He said he said Christ, he said
[58:16] Christ is the word now. peace. Now
[58:19] talking about Satan now in Revelation 12
[58:22] verse 7-9 Satan is the accuser
[58:27] you want to put that down he said you
[58:29] want to read it you got it got time now
[58:33] now it it is 12 it is 12 15 until 15
[58:40] until 10 uh then it goes
[58:43] but in revelation 12 7-9, right? Satan.
[58:49] The spirit of Satan. Yep. Is the spirit
[58:53] of Satan which is up there now
[58:58] of our brothers.
[59:00] All right. The church is taking up way.
[59:04] Let me read. Amen. Satan the spirit.
[59:06] Satan the spirit the devil which is up
[59:09] there now accusing our brother. Excuse
[59:12] me. Accusing our brother. All right. The
[59:16] church is taken up
[59:18] and Satan is cast out. When the church
[59:23] goes up, Satan comes down.
[59:28] Satan acquainted himself in the
[59:30] antichrist and is called to be the
[59:32] position that Satan is. I got to stop
[59:35] the rapture because as long as the
[59:38] rapture is not going on, as long as
[59:39] there ain't nobody caught up, he's still
[59:41] in the heaven. He's sure in your
[59:44] position. He still got the place of God
[59:46] that I can come to you and fight your
[59:48] mind and give you my mind because he's
[59:50] in a position that does not even blow
[59:52] down. We have all he's the principality.
[59:56] He's a God of this universe like this at
[1:00:00] right now. As long as he's in that
[1:00:02] position,
[1:00:05] right? He tries to hold position, right?
[1:00:08] Right? Cuz he know the he said I read
[1:00:11] said when the last member
[1:00:14] come in and recognize her place the rape
[1:00:17] take place.
[1:00:18] Satan don't know who the last member is.
[1:00:21] So the best way to do it is to keep
[1:00:22] pressure on everybody.
[1:00:25] Keep pressure on everybody. He got to
[1:00:27] get the right
[1:00:29] he up the pressure. on this church
[1:00:33] called a bride. He turned sales off. He
[1:00:36] looked $200,000.
[1:00:38] Right. Yes, sir. He said if that be a
[1:00:40] bride now, she going to love us. Right.
[1:00:43] So now
[1:00:45] what we doing? We find it in the Z that
[1:00:48] we living in. Satan is stopping the
[1:00:51] people from recognizing right the bride
[1:00:53] from recognize her position in heavenly
[1:00:56] places. It doesn't work. So when you
[1:00:57] know he fighting us with every demonic
[1:00:59] power and he's constantly accusing us.
[1:01:01] Right. Right. Absolutely. And you say,
[1:01:04] "How will I beat the accuser?"
[1:01:07] That's the answer. Amen. How will I beat
[1:01:10] the accuser? Right. And I, you know,
[1:01:12] because with Satan accusing us, the
[1:01:15] majority of the times he's right.
[1:01:19] You know, if you're accusing, you done
[1:01:21] something that the devil going to remind
[1:01:22] you over and over. And you said in your
[1:01:24] mind, I didn't do that. And he knows
[1:01:27] that. So if he accuse he accuse the
[1:01:29] bride and make her stay in this level of
[1:01:32] selfdeeat. Paul taught it in Romans 8.
[1:01:34] For there is now no condemnation to them
[1:01:36] that are great and walk. I mean Satan
[1:01:40] know I mean if he can keep us under
[1:01:41] condemnation we'll never rise to that
[1:01:44] position. Right. Amen. And we it ain't
[1:01:46] like we go out and drink and do all
[1:01:48] these things like that. He knows that.
[1:01:50] But our biggest battle is condemnation.
[1:01:52] Right. How many is being able to accept
[1:01:56] I'm good enough to make the rapture and
[1:01:58] not by yourself, but I ain't talking
[1:01:59] about my flesh. I'm talking about the
[1:02:01] word that's in me. Honey, the rapture
[1:02:03] already in me. Right. Right. Amen. But
[1:02:06] to accuse you,
[1:02:08] that's what we wrestle against. He says,
[1:02:11] he said, "Now the devil which is which
[1:02:14] is up there now accuser of the brothers,
[1:02:17] right?
[1:02:19] stays there to accuse us to keep us from
[1:02:23] the position that belongs to us because
[1:02:26] now if he can keep us under the spirit
[1:02:28] of condemnation then the scripture got
[1:02:31] to be fulfilled. Paul said for now there
[1:02:33] is now no condemnation to them that are
[1:02:35] in Christ. So now if we stay under this
[1:02:38] condition and we bribe and we still
[1:02:40] under condemnation there got to be a
[1:02:43] time when all that stuff move out of the
[1:02:45] way so we can r out of position. So Paul
[1:02:48] begin to say cast down right
[1:02:51] every high thing. Yeah. The point of it
[1:02:54] is we ain't got the revelation how to
[1:02:56] get rid of it. Cast it out. Cuz we
[1:02:58] trying to do it in oursel. We trying to
[1:03:01] be doing good for 6 weeks and then all
[1:03:02] of a sudden boom, right? You know, you
[1:03:06] get to thinking somebody that maybe you
[1:03:07] know
[1:03:09] been pretty good.
[1:03:13] And you said how I'm going to keep it
[1:03:15] down. I The way to keep the way to keep
[1:03:17] yourself down is that the way to keep
[1:03:19] the the down is keep yourself humble.
[1:03:21] Right. How do you keep yourself
[1:03:23] dependent on God? How you begin? The
[1:03:26] more you learn and let God take over,
[1:03:29] the more the condemnation, the lesson.
[1:03:31] And on you, what type of man see the man
[1:03:33] carrying a bag? Yeah.
[1:03:36] Psych on his back.
[1:03:39] This guy was in a dream. I think I' been
[1:03:41] a long time. But anyway, this old man
[1:03:43] was going up this hill. He was
[1:03:45] struggling. He had this big sight on his
[1:03:48] back. He was dragging along. This young
[1:03:51] guy was walking beside him.
[1:03:54] He seen this old man in this. He was
[1:03:56] just struggling
[1:03:58] trying to get up this hill. And this
[1:04:00] young boy asked this man says, "Sir."
[1:04:04] And the man turned to look. He said,
[1:04:06] "What do you got in that sight?" He
[1:04:08] said, "Sins."
[1:04:12] The guy looked mad. Mhm. He said, he
[1:04:15] cured. The guy thinking in his mind,
[1:04:18] this old man scrubbed me because he
[1:04:20] turned the sins of the world and he
[1:04:22] dragged me sack. He says, "Sir, whose
[1:04:26] sins you got in the sight?" He's in your
[1:04:28] sins. Yeah. Just call
[1:04:33] you realize here that Christ took your
[1:04:36] He can't cross. He nailed it down for
[1:04:40] you that you don't have to suffer the
[1:04:42] spirit of Jesus.
[1:04:44] Amen. How are you going to accept it by
[1:04:46] faith? That's right, man. Amen. That's
[1:04:48] right. You got to accept what God done
[1:04:51] by faith. Right. I said people the same
[1:04:53] faith to save you is the same faith to
[1:04:56] forgive you. That's right. How many
[1:04:57] people say, "Well, I got faith to be
[1:04:59] saved, but they ain't got faith to
[1:05:01] forgive themselves." Yeah. Right.
[1:05:04] Hallelujah. So it faith to save you, it
[1:05:06] going to take faith to stay saved. Even
[1:05:09] when the accuser come, they're going to
[1:05:11] take faith to accept. Right. Amen.
[1:05:14] Right? Why you think before he preached
[1:05:15] the seven seals, he preached the breach.
[1:05:19] He could have went straight into the
[1:05:20] seven seals. But if he would have went
[1:05:22] into the seven seal without preaching
[1:05:24] the breach, the devil would have came to
[1:05:26] you say, "You'll never be there. You
[1:05:29] ain't." He would jump on me and you here
[1:05:31] say, "You'll never be there."
[1:05:32] Hallelujah. You know what? You see how
[1:05:34] holy this seven seal is, you will never
[1:05:36] be good enough. So he knew that. God
[1:05:38] knew the plan of the mind of Satan. So
[1:05:40] God before he preached the seal, he
[1:05:42] preached the breach. If you know before
[1:05:44] he preach the preach, he call her bleach
[1:05:47] because he know if the bride will get
[1:05:49] the revelation that she didn't get in
[1:05:51] the bleach, she has for
[1:06:03] crazy, but you got to be crazy to accept
[1:06:05] this message. That's right. You trying
[1:06:07] to figure this out in your own way from
[1:06:10] it. Hallelujah. They got it and they
[1:06:12] went through. So anyway, but we realize
[1:06:14] here the people there the war that we
[1:06:16] fight against accusers. I mean the
[1:06:18] accusers are standing there over and
[1:06:19] over. Young people make a mistake. I
[1:06:21] think the devil get you trapped you up
[1:06:22] to do something and you know you love
[1:06:24] God but he won't let go of that. That's
[1:06:26] right. He'll stay right there. Cuz as
[1:06:29] long as he can hold you on earth and you
[1:06:32] had cover that cover that sin, right, he
[1:06:34] still got you. That's right. He still
[1:06:36] got you. Right. But if you ever get the
[1:06:38] revelation that God took your sins and
[1:06:42] he nailed it to his cross. Hallelujah.
[1:06:44] All that I done been dropped in the
[1:06:46] bleach. And not only was he die for me,
[1:06:48] but he died for my iniquity. He died for
[1:06:50] my transgression. All he turned to his
[1:06:53] cross. How the faith is in him done his
[1:06:55] thing. Right. So hard, man. We can't
[1:06:59] forgive. Amen. Why you think it was
[1:07:02] hard? You say it's easy to forgive then
[1:07:04] try. Yeah. Let somebody do you wrong.
[1:07:07] You trying to for
[1:07:09] it ain't like you think it is.
[1:07:12] Like it is to think you. Somebody do you
[1:07:14] wrong and try to forgive. You see what
[1:07:16] the devil work your mind over.
[1:07:19] You let somebody borrow $10,000 from
[1:07:21] you.
[1:07:24] They don't pay you back.
[1:07:27] Man, I'm going have to be on the
[1:07:30] B going to be good.
[1:07:34] Yes, sir. Anything I did not as long as
[1:07:38] I'm happy about him is not good. Right.
[1:07:41] I know. I I went down my cousin, my
[1:07:44] first cousin come up to me and he I just
[1:07:47] had got saved. It must have been my
[1:07:49] first tense.
[1:07:53] He just the devil just I shouldn't leave
[1:07:55] there like 3 or 4 years. I just got
[1:07:57] sorry about it right after I got saved 6
[1:07:59] month. I am a major guest. Amen. My
[1:08:03] cousin come to me and said, "Bro, Joel,
[1:08:06] you know, we we grow my office and
[1:08:07] daddy. We real close. We in favor of
[1:08:09] each other." And he's come to me say,
[1:08:11] "Hey man." He said, he says, "I want you
[1:08:14] to sign for me a car." Oh boy.
[1:08:18] Cuz I'm signing for me the money to get
[1:08:19] the car. Oh my. I said, "All right." So
[1:08:22] I said, "I do it for you, man." He said,
[1:08:24] "You know how we spam.
[1:08:30] You ain't no homo.
[1:08:34] Well, you better listen. You better run
[1:08:36] when they start talking like that.
[1:08:40] And they start calling you cousin. They
[1:08:41] ain't never call you cousin. You better
[1:08:42] run. You're my cousin. You better start
[1:08:44] running.
[1:08:49] He even talking to me. I said, "All
[1:08:51] right, man." I said, "I know how we
[1:08:53] man." Hey, man. I'm thinking, man, my
[1:08:55] wife said, "You think you need to do
[1:08:56] that moment?
[1:09:03] You let me wear my
[1:09:06] I know it.
[1:09:09] I wish I would listen.
[1:09:12] But anyway, I went on down there. I
[1:09:15] think it was when the finance company I
[1:09:18] he said I said, "How much you need?"
[1:09:20] You're looking at in probably early 80s.
[1:09:22] So I signed for it and by the time you
[1:09:25] pay it back, it's about $1,600 or so.
[1:09:28] the loan and that's I signed for him. I
[1:09:29] got the money and uh I gave it to him
[1:09:32] and uh he said all right I got you and
[1:09:36] all of a sudden I gave it to him first
[1:09:39] for one he brought one paper to me two
[1:09:42] but then I didn't see him no more for
[1:09:43] the next 5 years.
[1:09:48] Oh you talking about thoughts
[1:09:52] thinking to myself when I see him this
[1:09:55] ain't going to be good. I think about
[1:09:57] how I wanted to walk with Google. You
[1:09:58] got no money? He said, "No."
[1:10:04] He said, "You didn't have them thought."
[1:10:07] Oh yes, I did have them thought I
[1:10:10] thought about how I had all kind of way.
[1:10:12] I'm going to do I thought I said if I
[1:10:13] don't hit him
[1:10:15] then I would feel good. I feel like I
[1:10:17] got something out of this way. But you
[1:10:19] know we end up with but he guarded me
[1:10:21] and he guarded me. And now I begin to
[1:10:23] realize I said Lord help me to release
[1:10:25] this anger. Hallelujah. Now the devil
[1:10:28] there to remind me you got something.
[1:10:31] Every time I turn around he bringing a
[1:10:32] lollipop to my mind.
[1:10:36] He look over I see this lollipop walking
[1:10:39] beside
[1:10:42] man. But you know what it was. I decided
[1:10:45] I said Lord be mad here. Help me to
[1:10:48] forgive this guy. And I just forgot
[1:10:49] about it. And about three years of man,
[1:10:52] I love you. I know about three years.
[1:10:53] Three years later, the man fell on the
[1:10:55] conviction. He come
[1:11:02] we did not do anything in ourselves.
[1:11:04] You'll wear yourself to death to try to
[1:11:06] fight against somebody that hate you.
[1:11:09] You need to commit it to God and have
[1:11:11] the faith to hold it. And when he break
[1:11:13] the service in, he taking the sword and
[1:11:16] holding it there. You know when we take
[1:11:17] the sword and we kill the devil but we
[1:11:19] don't kill him.
[1:11:21] The devil get to plead. Oh yeah. Please
[1:11:24] let me up. You got him down. Don't move
[1:11:27] the sword. Right. Amen. I leave you
[1:11:29] alone for 2 months.
[1:11:32] Yeah. Give him a second chance. And then
[1:11:35] we pull the sword up and they know that
[1:11:37] Nate's battle is worse than the first
[1:11:39] one. I mean he said when you let he when
[1:11:41] you drive the sword in don't let him up.
[1:11:44] Don't look at him. Keep your eyes on the
[1:11:46] word. When you look at something, it's
[1:11:48] hard to kill. Hallelujah. Yeah.
[1:11:52] Right. If you look at things, it's hard
[1:11:54] to kill. Right. You know, I was looking
[1:11:56] at them rabbits yesterday. I had all
[1:11:59] kind of thoughts about them rabbits.
[1:12:04] I walked ahead and I look at them big,
[1:12:06] pretty fluffy rabbits
[1:12:09] and I start thinking about Thanksgiving.
[1:12:16] And I had one delusion hit me. I said, I
[1:12:19] see that river with a ball run through
[1:12:20] him. He rode on the fire.
[1:12:25] But it ain't going to work cuz I done
[1:12:26] asked sister Dale. I was going to have
[1:12:28] it. And she said, "You ain't eat no
[1:12:30] rabbits."
[1:12:34] Back to page one. Gave no rabbits.
[1:12:37] But I don't give away. I think I want
[1:12:45] you ask me when you say you got that
[1:12:47] real I got it. It's part of the human
[1:12:49] kingdom.
[1:12:54] But you know we got to come to a church.
[1:12:58] We have got to come get a revelation.
[1:12:59] That's right. We got to lay aside ever
[1:13:03] wait. See, Satan is holding the people
[1:13:05] back. We worry too much. We worry about
[1:13:09] things too much. We we something go
[1:13:11] wrong and then the next thing you know a
[1:13:13] financial something come up. The first
[1:13:14] thing this devil put on you is worrying.
[1:13:17] And worrying is not of God. That's
[1:13:19] right. You might feel like it's of God,
[1:13:21] but it's not of God. Well, I don't do
[1:13:23] nothing wrong with worrying. When you
[1:13:24] doing something real wrong, you're
[1:13:25] killing your own self. Hallelujah. You
[1:13:28] killing your own self. You are literally
[1:13:29] tearing down your immune system so the
[1:13:31] devil can get you off the urban life.
[1:13:34] Hallelujah. And they were wearing caused
[1:13:36] high blood pressure, heart trouble, and
[1:13:38] all kind of. And the devil put on us.
[1:13:41] Right. That's right. Right. And we
[1:13:43] really believe that God was in control.
[1:13:45] Oh yeah. And that God might know my
[1:13:47] every need. Right. I heard him sing in a
[1:13:49] song. I show He knows my name. I think I
[1:13:52] heard him practicing it this morning
[1:13:53] with the young people breaking that
[1:13:54] song.
[1:13:56] They know it somewhat. But I that was a
[1:14:00] song that was say he knows my name. If
[1:14:02] God knows my name, he know my every
[1:14:05] need. How do he know what I have need of
[1:14:07] before I even ask it? Hallelujah. He
[1:14:09] want me to do to not worry him by coming
[1:14:11] to him, worrying God to death. Lord, I
[1:14:14] need this and I need that. He I don't
[1:14:15] want you to take no thought on that. I
[1:14:17] want you to praise me. I want you to get
[1:14:19] your mind on God and get your mind over
[1:14:21] what I'm going to do with it. It ain't
[1:14:23] your job to worry about God taking care
[1:14:24] of you. That's God.
[1:14:26] Amen. His job is for you to come and
[1:14:29] worship you. All right. Amen. Because he
[1:14:31] know who you are. Right. The musicians
[1:14:33] come this morning.
[1:14:36] He knows my name. That's right. Amen.
[1:14:38] And he want us to give our all to God.
[1:14:41] G. And this accuser that's ascending
[1:14:43] here to fighting us, right? He's trying
[1:14:46] his best to keep us on this earthly
[1:14:49] journey. That's right, brother. And I
[1:14:51] feel you find people that's 10, 15 years
[1:14:53] down the road. Mhm. And you find them
[1:14:56] under the you find them come out under
[1:14:58] this revelation.
[1:15:00] How did the devil kick them out of the
[1:15:02] first?
[1:15:04] The Bible said they mumbled and
[1:15:06] complained.
[1:15:08] He paralyzed their faith. They should
[1:15:11] have went in and touched the land, but
[1:15:13] they did not take the land because they
[1:15:14] were walking around in circles mumbling
[1:15:17] and complaining. Wowy wy ain't no good
[1:15:21] things in the message. Everybody commit
[1:15:23] adultery. Everybody ain't committ.
[1:15:31] I know I got the Holy Ghost. I feel it.
[1:15:33] Well, you ain't got the one I got.
[1:15:36] Hallelujah. Holy Ghost ain't a feeling
[1:15:37] people. We know the Holy Ghost got
[1:15:39] feeling in it. But if you basing your
[1:15:40] revelation off of feeling, you won't be
[1:15:42] disappointed. Hallelujah. Brother say
[1:15:44] filling time is not over. Hallelujah.
[1:15:46] You don't hardly feel half the time you
[1:15:48] don't even feel saved. That's right. So
[1:15:50] you let us be saved by faith, not by
[1:15:52] works.
[1:15:55] That's right. But the one, we done got
[1:15:57] the Holy Ghost mixed up with We don't
[1:15:59] got it mixed up with second Matthew 10.
[1:16:02] We done got the Holy Ghost mixed up with
[1:16:04] that with that that outpouring of power,
[1:16:06] right? Jesus gave them power, right, to
[1:16:08] become sons of God, right? And this act
[1:16:10] of power, they cast out devils. They
[1:16:12] preach. They shared the mystery. 272
[1:16:16] church book. They shared the ministry.
[1:16:18] But when it come down to the showdown,
[1:16:21] Judas didn't have it. He did not have
[1:16:25] that was not that was the Holy Ghost
[1:16:27] that more people get. They get it under
[1:16:29] but I I got the mysteries. I'm in the
[1:16:31] word. I got to see God move. I see power
[1:16:33] but ain't the but the Holy Ghost don't
[1:16:34] talk about was the word when they went
[1:16:35] to Acts 238 they receive the Holy Ghost.
[1:16:38] Acts one, they come out of the room.
[1:16:40] They was chained people. Paul didn't go
[1:16:42] back and start committing adultery. Hal
[1:16:44] Peter didn't go back and fall in
[1:16:45] adultery. They ain't going back drinking
[1:16:46] and smoking and doing anything. One they
[1:16:49] got the Holy Ghost change. That's the
[1:16:51] kind of Holy Ghost we
[1:16:54] give you. I had two experience when it
[1:16:56] changed my soul. God one they come out
[1:16:59] of the upper room standing under the
[1:17:00] influence of the Holy Ghost that s
[1:17:07] a weak woman. Right. Not just a village.
[1:17:10] Right. A change you. Sure. Exactly. my
[1:17:13] last comment. I've been studied on
[1:17:16] butterflies again.
[1:17:19] I been studied on butterflies. I can't
[1:17:21] get away from Okay, I'm going to say
[1:17:23] this. My last comment,
[1:17:25] it's already in you. Sure. Your rapture
[1:17:28] is already in you.
[1:17:30] Just like the caterpillar,
[1:17:33] right? Everything he need to become a
[1:17:35] butterfly,
[1:17:37] it's already in him. Yeah, he have got
[1:17:40] the ability to ascend up from the earth
[1:17:44] to the heavens. Now you say, do he know
[1:17:46] it? He might not understand it all,
[1:17:48] right? But he do understand this.
[1:17:53] And one thing that we all understand,
[1:17:57] you don't have to tell us how to eat,
[1:17:58] right? You just set the chicken down. We
[1:18:00] didn't know what to do with it.
[1:18:03] And so you got to in other words the
[1:18:05] substance don't become uh uh the the the
[1:18:08] substance of chickens don't become part
[1:18:10] of you by looking at it man that look
[1:18:13] good.
[1:18:15] You can look at it all day long and die
[1:18:16] right but if you ever take it in you
[1:18:20] where that caterpillar he begin to nurse
[1:18:22] and he begin to eat. He begin to eat. He
[1:18:24] begin to eat. What is he doing? He's
[1:18:26] becoming the revelation of his
[1:18:28] substance. How he eating what he's
[1:18:30] eating he's becoming. Right? Because he
[1:18:32] got to put enough food in him to give
[1:18:34] him enough script to change his body.
[1:18:37] What didn't happen on the people had had
[1:18:39] enough word then the test go they didn't
[1:18:43] have enough script for the change.
[1:18:44] That's right. Hallelujah. So but they
[1:18:45] tell police and all of a sudden
[1:18:49] he begin to go up himself. He attaches
[1:18:53] himself to the lamb. Right. He didn't
[1:18:56] need nobody to attach him. Right. He
[1:18:58] didn't need you with a hammer to nail
[1:18:59] him up. I beg him to come to church
[1:19:02] on the boys and I' been for 20 years. He
[1:19:05] didn't need that. All he need attach
[1:19:07] himself. Right now I think one of them
[1:19:10] spin under maybe the mouse spins a
[1:19:12] cocoon. But if the original caterpillar
[1:19:15] he don't spin a cocoon and I used to use
[1:19:17] that but actually what he do he forms a
[1:19:19] thing called a crystal. How his body
[1:19:22] begin to christenate itself and he
[1:19:24] become c. And when he forms this
[1:19:26] crystal, his body that the shape of that
[1:19:29] crystal is the shape of what is what he
[1:19:32] going to look like when he come out.
[1:19:33] Hallelujah. God put him in the great
[1:19:35] sculpture and God begin to put him in a
[1:19:37] crystal. Hallelujah. We God himself he
[1:19:40] put him in a crystal called human flesh.
[1:19:43] Hallelujah. But down on the inside and
[1:19:45] you eat the word. Hallelujah. It's
[1:19:47] forming what on the inside of you and
[1:19:49] going to look just like this day on the
[1:19:50] other side. Right. Exactly.
[1:19:54] Right. And then I found out when that
[1:19:57] credit caliber pillow goes into the
[1:19:58] crystal,
[1:20:00] what he do his body on liquidates itself
[1:20:05] completely become liquid.
[1:20:08] And the reason for his body to become
[1:20:10] liquid that the before a caterpillar
[1:20:14] could become a butterfly, every cell
[1:20:17] that was in the caterpillar must be
[1:20:20] dissolved. A butterfly have no
[1:20:23] caterpillar cells in it at all. How do
[1:20:25] he liquidate and swallow up every cell
[1:20:29] that was in the caterpillar when it
[1:20:30] become a butterfly? It don't have no
[1:20:32] caterpillar at all. Hallelujah. It
[1:20:34] become it become a beating in itself. I
[1:20:37] mean that what God doing tonight.
[1:20:41] That's right. Death going to be
[1:20:42] swallowed up. Hallelujah. When we come
[1:20:44] out, we don't have no death at all. time

[1:28:34] told me, he said, "Why don't you preach
[1:28:36] one of the services?" I said, "The
[1:28:38] people ain't coming to hear me. They
[1:28:40] hear me all the time. They're coming to
[1:28:42] hear you." Right? So then that's that's
[1:28:44] the way we believe, right? Amen. Now, we
[1:28:46] want everybody to stay and eat together.
[1:28:49] We hope you'll eat and devour all the
[1:28:51] food because it's kind of like Dr. Uh,
[1:28:55] brother Gur's dad, Dr. Atkins, one time
[1:28:57] he's at the house and I said, "Well, you
[1:28:58] better eat all of this cuz if you don't,
[1:29:00] I'm going to have to eat what's left
[1:29:02] over." He said, "You pour the honey."
[1:29:05] So, you know, we got a lot of fish and a
[1:29:08] lot of chili and we got, you know, hot
[1:29:10] dogs and everything and we want you to

[1:29:45] Father we thank you. We love you and we
[1:29:48] just commit everything into your hands
[1:29:50] this day, Lord, knowing that we are
[1:29:53] needy people and our brother has said
[1:29:55] exactly what we need.
[1:29:58] We need to get out of these old cocoons
[1:29:59] and things and come forth as a beautiful
[1:30:02] butterfly.
[1:30:04] We need you, Lord. Help us to be, as he
[1:30:07] said, to get away from listening to the
[1:30:09] devil talk to us and tell us how we feel
[1:30:11] and what we're doing. Cuz even sometimes
[1:30:13] he'll tell us the truth.
[1:30:16] But yet he always has a part in that to
[1:30:18] make a lie out of it where it's damaging
[1:30:20] to each one. We love you, Father, and we
[1:30:23] thank you. We ask you to sanctify the
[1:30:25] food as we go to fellowship together to
[1:30:28] eat a little meal and things. And we
[1:30:30] love you and we thank you. We commit it
[1:30:32] all to you now in Jesus name. Amen.
