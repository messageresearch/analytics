[0:22] here this morning
[0:26] this song
[0:28] is an old song by the lafontaines it
[0:31] says
[0:32] um
[0:33] that no matter what we go go through
[0:36] we've reached the point of no return
[0:39] we can't go back on god now
[0:53] when i think of all the lord
[0:58] has done
[0:59] for me
[1:03] he's fully prevailed
[1:07] so i can walk in victory
[1:11] [Music]
[1:16] having touched the cross
[1:19] and felt the pain he bore
[1:24] [Music]
[1:27] forsaking all my life
[1:30] before

[1:35] for heaven sure
[1:38] to go with him all the way

[11:38] we certainly
[11:40] want to thank god for this privilege
[11:41] again to be
[11:43] in his house
[11:44] and every time we're here it's just a
[11:47] great privilege that god has grant to us
[11:50] amen to be in his house many have
[11:52] passed and
[11:54] gone on
[11:55] over the past two years
[11:58] it's just a real troubling time but
[12:00] by god's grace we are here amen
[12:03] and we're still fighting the fight of
[12:05] faith
[12:06] holding on to
[12:07] our great
[12:08] salvation amen i'd like to bring you
[12:10] greetings from
[12:12] our church in lynn jamaica
[12:15] and um from the other ministers brother
[12:17] lewis brother
[12:18] walman brother brady
[12:20] um mccoy
[12:23] but the jonathan and different ones we
[12:26] greet you
[12:27] in jesus christ's name
[12:30] i've always tried to keep the unity
[12:33] of
[12:34] the brethren
[12:36] you know
[12:37] and um so
[12:39] i can have an open door
[12:41] everywhere
[12:43] because the same people you have here is
[12:45] the same people you'll spend eternity
[12:47] with
[12:48] so you might as well
[12:50] be able to live and get together
[12:52] and get along on this side
[12:54] amen you know i many times says we
[12:57] certainly have little differences really
[13:00] i don't know if there's anybody who i
[13:02] see eye to eye with on everything but by
[13:06] the grace of god we
[13:08] aim and have a perfect word
[13:10] that's a reflection really
[13:13] and by that we can thank god hallelujah
[13:16] that at least we can greet one another
[13:19] hug one another's neck and says i love
[13:21] you my brother
[13:23] amen praise god so we certainly thank
[13:25] god for that um the past two years have
[13:28] been
[13:29] really hard 2019 was a very active time
[13:32] for me
[13:33] you know um i remember the immigration
[13:36] officer was asking me he said why did
[13:38] you come to the states so many times
[13:40] 2019. i said if you look i was just
[13:42] transferring because i'm on my way to
[13:45] africa
[13:46] um
[13:48] i went to nigeria
[13:50] and on that trip to nigeria i went to
[13:52] uganda then i went to
[13:55] kenya
[13:57] back to uganda then back home
[13:59] then
[14:00] they invited me back
[14:02] to um
[14:03] uganda in december
[14:05] and i went to fort portal to preach that
[14:07] convention
[14:09] and by that convention it had opened the
[14:11] door and they wanted me back at easter
[14:13] time and uh so 2020 i had a ticket for
[14:16] easter and one week before i left home
[14:20] everywhere was shut down
[14:22] and um so it's a good thing i i didn't
[14:24] leave home
[14:26] i can imagine if i'd left home and got
[14:29] stuck somewhere i could just see
[14:31] francie's face
[14:33] crying for a husband
[14:38] but that's the way i am
[14:40] so
[14:41] i mean we thank god for everything
[14:43] really
[14:44] and so like for two years i i didn't do
[14:47] anything but stay home
[14:49] you know there were some times when i
[14:50] was the only person in the assemble but
[14:52] thank god we had learned to stream
[14:54] before the pandemic so you know we could
[14:57] continue what we're doing and we kind of
[15:00] help the others to set up in their local
[15:02] assembly you know to do the same thing
[15:04] really so you know we had all things in
[15:06] in common
[15:08] you know um so remember brother brady in
[15:10] your purse you know is short her memory
[15:14] is just really leaving him really and um
[15:17] this year is actually 84. so brother
[15:20] valman is actually
[15:21] valman clark is actually the pastor of
[15:24] the church there in farmtown
[15:26] because um one good thing with brother
[15:29] brady he accept
[15:31] that um his memory is going
[15:33] there's a lot of people whose memories
[15:35] start to go you've got to fight with
[15:36] them really because they think that you
[15:38] are sick and they are okay
[15:41] but he he accept it really and um you
[15:44] know
[15:45] he tell me he said brother keith i'll be
[15:47] talking to somebody here
[15:48] and i turn around and when i come back i
[15:51] said who is this because he don't
[15:53] remember who that is really or if you
[15:56] call him on the phone he say a few words
[15:58] and so and he passed on the phone he
[16:00] hangs it up really because he doesn't
[16:02] remember that he's under the call so you
[16:05] know but but it's a part of all ages
[16:06] just that demon
[16:08] really
[16:09] but um we we trust in god brother
[16:11] branham said you know man might be out
[16:13] of his mind
[16:15] you know but he's still got the holy
[16:17] ghost and still rapture ready amen
[16:21] because um
[16:23] this old man does not determine
[16:26] you know but when you are born again
[16:28] that tiapany man
[16:30] and one day that call
[16:33] you not with the glorified body
[16:35] what a change that's going to be
[16:37] amen praise god so we we thank god for
[16:40] these things really that how would we
[16:43] know them
[16:44] you know um
[16:45] it's not thought theology or bible
[16:47] school or so but god has sent us a voice
[16:50] in this day amen praise god and by that
[16:54] we we certainly thank god for who we are
[16:57] then on this trip i've gotta cut my stay
[17:00] in in the states short because i've got
[17:02] to go to canada because our house is
[17:05] empty these days because the girls have
[17:08] gone to canada to live
[17:10] and so
[17:11] um do we talk every day every single day
[17:15] many times for the day
[17:16] but i've not seen them in two years
[17:20] and i'll be going to
[17:21] to see them and so so they're excited
[17:24] and i'm excited to see them really
[17:27] and um
[17:28] the challenges we had during the covid
[17:30] it has changed our lifestyle totally
[17:34] and so now we've got a business that
[17:35] we've got to work on and um people are
[17:37] depending on us so we we can't travel
[17:40] together francine and myself and so but
[17:42] i was talking to her i said man i'll
[17:44] never travel without you
[17:46] because um sometimes the little things
[17:49] you know
[17:50] and um
[17:51] you know man i'll put on any pair of
[17:53] socks on any shirt if it's man
[17:57] you know what i mean but um
[17:58] she said that's a reflection of her
[18:01] so um
[18:02] but sometimes i do it to aggravate her
[18:04] really you know i
[18:06] i had my solid black pants and i put on
[18:09] a striped jacket
[18:10] and i said i know she's going to call me
[18:12] jesus so
[18:15] when she said jesus look at my husband
[18:18] [Laughter]
[18:22] so she
[18:24] she she gave me a note
[18:26] on my phone she said dear husband
[18:29] and this shirt goes with this really but
[18:32] i i don't always read it
[18:33] because i really don't want to
[18:35] even
[18:36] but we thank god for our families
[18:39] amen we thank god for the dearest to us
[18:42] really
[18:43] and so we thank god for the friendship
[18:45] we have
[18:46] amen
[18:47] you know um
[18:48] praise god
[18:49] amen i thank god for this church
[18:52] that has helped me over the years and
[18:55] wherever i go i tell them that um i had
[18:58] a teacher when i was
[18:59] in my youth brother sam deal and he's
[19:02] really helped me
[19:03] to with the opening of the world
[19:06] you know the way i think the way i i
[19:08] look at the scriptures you know it's
[19:10] because of that really
[19:12] because sometimes the focus is different
[19:14] everywhere you go some persons you know
[19:16] and sometimes in the message we you know
[19:19] you hear people preach and you know i
[19:21] could go back for my textbook in
[19:23] psychology or social psychology and
[19:25] that's just what you're saying but
[19:27] there's a word for the redeemed
[19:29] amen praise god
[19:31] and all of that's not going to get us
[19:33] out of here amen
[19:35] there's a church and there's a bride and
[19:38] i thank god the bride is elected to
[19:40] stand
[19:40] and she will stand upon the word amen so
[19:44] let us stand on our feet this morning
[19:46] uh
[19:47] it would be appropriate to sing you a
[19:49] song now
[19:50] to get you in tune but if i sing you
[19:52] might walk out so we might as well go on
[19:57] amen we've got so much singers back home
[20:00] i don't know why the lord didn't give me
[20:02] part of that really
[20:04] i would trade some of what i have but
[20:06] there's hardly anything i have really so
[20:08] i might as well stick with what i have
[20:10] in any case
[20:12] i'm going to read from genesis 1 26 to
[20:14] 28
[20:15] in genesis 2
[20:17] and if you find it then we're going to
[20:20] talk to the author of the word um as
[20:22] this is the kisha here known for a long
[20:24] time amen and we certainly treasure her
[20:27] in jamaica i thought she would have sing
[20:28] that song that i love
[20:30] amen but she didn't sing that this
[20:31] morning
[20:32] i can't hold back on him i've walked
[20:35] away from sin that's a beautiful song
[20:38] amen praise god so let's just bow our
[20:40] heads this morning
[20:42] our great god and father when i thank
[20:44] you god for this day you have given to
[20:45] us
[20:47] lord god we we we've caught up and we
[20:49] have
[20:50] lord because of friendship lord god
[20:51] we've said many things but
[20:53] lord god we pray that you're sending
[20:55] your anointing of the holy spirit oh god
[20:57] because lord god there's a need in your
[20:59] people's heart and lord god you promise
[21:02] that you'll speak to us by your word
[21:04] heavenly father we pray now that you'd
[21:06] come on the scene and lord god may you
[21:08] change the atmosphere
[21:10] take my thoughts and the lips that speak
[21:12] and
[21:13] lord god made you anoint and anoint the
[21:16] years that would hear it oh god and we
[21:18] we pray god that all that is in the
[21:20] hearing of my voice whether here or uh
[21:23] streaming from somewhere lord god we
[21:26] pray that oh god that will hear from you
[21:28] this morning
[21:29] because lord god there's nothing of us
[21:31] to present but lord god it is all of you
[21:34] christ the hope of glory
[21:36] bless us now as we look to you and
[21:38] believe you in jesus christ's name we
[21:40] pray
[21:41] amen
[21:42] and amen
[21:44] you know um
[21:47] i was thinking that um
[21:50] maybe somebody might be somewhere and
[21:51] they hear me preach and a message and
[21:53] they said uh you know i
[21:58] but the kids preached this way or
[21:59] brother keith preached that way but i
[22:01] preach based on where i am
[22:03] amen
[22:04] and so i was just in south carolina at
[22:07] the tenth meeting i never used a quote i
[22:10] just preached from the scriptures and
[22:12] the inspiration of the holy spirit
[22:13] because we're preaching to
[22:16] people who have never heard
[22:18] you know we want to preach repentance
[22:20] and healing and deliverance really but
[22:22] to the bride of christ
[22:24] we change our thought and so this
[22:26] morning i'd like to speak on the
[22:27] abstract title deed
[22:30] amen in genesis 1 26-28 he said
[22:34] and god said let us make man in our
[22:37] image
[22:38] after our likeness and let them have
[22:39] dominion over the fish of the sea and
[22:42] over the fowl of the ear and over the
[22:44] catalan over all the earth
[22:47] and over every creeping thing that
[22:49] creepeth upon the earth so god created
[22:51] man in his own image in the image of god
[22:55] created in him male and female created
[22:58] them so if god is a spirit then this man
[23:02] had to be a spirit man
[23:04] and god blessed them
[23:06] and god said unto them be fruitful and
[23:10] multiply and replenish the earth and
[23:12] subdue it and have dominion over the
[23:14] fish of the sea and over the fowl of the
[23:17] year and over every living thing that
[23:20] move it upon the earth may the law that
[23:23] is blessing to the reading of the word
[23:25] you may be seated
[23:27] but then i'd follow with uh genesis 2 16
[23:30] and 17
[23:32] the bible says and the lord god
[23:34] commanded the man saying
[23:36] of every tree
[23:38] of the garden thou may freely eat
[23:41] but of the tree of knowledge of good and
[23:43] evil thou shalt not eat of it for in the
[23:47] day that thou eat thereof thou shall
[23:50] surely
[23:51] die
[23:53] so here god gave him dominion
[23:56] of the fish of the sea the fowl of the
[23:58] year
[23:59] over every living thing that move it
[24:02] upon the earth he had dominion
[24:05] he could speak and they would come they
[24:08] would obey him as a command
[24:10] but then god in genesis 2 god put a
[24:14] condition
[24:16] to that dominion
[24:18] he said
[24:19] you should not eat of this tree
[24:23] and i just want to bring you too quickly
[24:25] to the the covenant that god gave to
[24:27] abraham
[24:28] this covenant to adam was a covenant
[24:31] with a condition
[24:33] but to abram he gave him a covenant
[24:35] without condition
[24:37] i'm going to bless you
[24:39] you you know if you whether you leave
[24:41] the land
[24:43] whatever you do i'm going to bless you
[24:46] and i want you to know this morning that
[24:48] is a covenant of the bride
[24:51] an unconditional covenant amen but
[24:55] that's not where i'm going in genesis 3
[24:57] and 17 and he said and adams
[25:00] and adam and to other me said because
[25:03] there was arcana to the voice of thy
[25:06] wife now no the fall comes in right
[25:08] there
[25:10] and as eaton of the tree of which i
[25:12] command thee saying thou shalt not eat
[25:15] of it curses the ground for thy sake
[25:19] in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the
[25:21] days of thy life
[25:22] thorns
[25:23] also and this shall it bring forth to
[25:25] thee and thou shall eat the herb of the
[25:28] field in the sweat of your face you
[25:31] shall eat bread till thou return unto
[25:34] the ground for out of it was thou taken
[25:37] for dost the what and unto dust shalt
[25:40] thou
[25:41] return i'd like to also tell you that no
[25:44] you shall eat of it you shall by the
[25:46] sweat of your brow
[25:48] you're going to plant it's going to
[25:49] bring forth to you and you're going to
[25:51] eat but before that fall yeah dominion
[25:55] he could speak
[25:57] and it would create
[25:59] and he would take of the earth amen
[26:03] then to cap that off in revelation
[26:04] chapter 5 and verse 1.
[26:07] so now we have seen that the man had
[26:10] fallen
[26:11] and the
[26:12] the covenant was conditional
[26:15] so he had break the cut the condition of
[26:17] the covenant and now the dominion that
[26:20] he had he had lost that dominion
[26:24] and i saw in the right hand of him that
[26:26] sat upon the throne a book written
[26:28] within and on the backside and it was
[26:31] sealed with seven seals
[26:33] and i saw a strong angel proclaiming
[26:36] with a loud voice who is worthy
[26:38] to open the book
[26:40] and to lose the seals thereof and no man
[26:43] in heaven are in earth neither under the
[26:46] earth was able to open the book neither
[26:48] to look there upon
[26:50] and i went much because no man was found
[26:53] worthy to open and to read the book
[26:56] neither to look thereon
[26:59] and one of the elders said unto me we
[27:02] not
[27:03] behold the lion of the tribe of judah
[27:06] the root of david as prevail to open the
[27:10] book and to lose the seven seals thereof
[27:13] now here it is
[27:15] it would seem like these scriptures are
[27:17] not connected
[27:20] but that is why god had to send us a
[27:22] voice
[27:24] because what he did he took the bible
[27:27] and he break
[27:28] by revelation the word of god and gave
[27:31] it to you and i
[27:32] no no so he said when when adam fall in
[27:35] the garden of eden he lost the book of
[27:38] redemption
[27:40] and that book of redemption had the
[27:42] names of the redeemed
[27:44] but adam had no more dominion to call
[27:48] his children out of the earth so the
[27:50] book went back into the hands of the
[27:52] original owner almighty god
[27:55] so you take back that dominion from man
[27:58] and he took it to himself
[28:00] hallelujah so if god had it
[28:03] somebody had to be able to go back and
[28:05] to take that book
[28:07] now in revelation five you know no
[28:10] brother brahm said like this he said god
[28:12] does it
[28:13] then he reveal it then he brings it to
[28:15] pass
[28:16] now here john and the isle of patmos was
[28:19] now seeing things that was before
[28:21] things that are
[28:22] are and things that will be
[28:25] and so
[28:26] hallelujah in revelation chapter 5 he
[28:28] was seeing before the foundation of the
[28:31] earth
[28:33] that mad god had put man on the earth
[28:36] free moral agency and man fall
[28:39] and the book of redemption went back in
[28:41] the hands of god
[28:43] so god hallelujah made a way of
[28:46] provision for man
[28:49] and what john saw in symbol he said he
[28:51] saw a lamb
[28:53] and that lamb is as though it was slain
[28:56] before the foundation of the world
[28:59] which is a reflection of calvary when
[29:01] the price was paid
[29:03] so all that god is going to do in the
[29:06] mind of god it's already done
[29:10] so we say god does it
[29:12] then he reveal it then he brings it to
[29:14] pass amen and and so revelation 5 says
[29:18] that the lamb was worthy
[29:21] to take the book
[29:23] hallelujah amen they said when when the
[29:26] lamb take the book hallelujah all the
[29:30] hosts of heaven
[29:32] hallelujah cried out
[29:34] amen blessed and holy and power and
[29:37] glory unto the lamb amen
[29:41] praise god
[29:43] now
[29:46] let me say it like this really
[29:49] jesus's ministry
[29:51] you know it progresses
[29:54] you know what i said it's not because
[29:56] jesus had to be baptized because he was
[29:58] born almighty god
[30:01] but jesus walked a pattern to show you
[30:04] and i
[30:06] the pattern that we must go through
[30:09] amen he was identified at jordan he was
[30:12] baptized at jordan
[30:14] the holy ghost came like a dove and sat
[30:17] upon him
[30:18] not because he needed that but he's
[30:20] showing you
[30:22] amen
[30:23] then he went to mount transfiguration
[30:26] not because he had to but he's showing
[30:28] you the part of adoption
[30:30] are you there with me
[30:32] amen
[30:33] hallelujah
[30:35] glory to god
[30:37] why do i believe this message
[30:39] because i see the scripture
[30:42] being made manifested in the message
[30:45] isn't right
[30:47] hallelujah
[30:48] that god sent somebody
[30:51] who was without theology
[30:54] without knowledge
[30:56] of bible school everything take by
[30:58] revelation the word of god and break for
[31:01] the bread of life to you and die
[31:03] amen
[31:04] hallelujah
[31:07] so jesus
[31:09] he turned the water into one his first
[31:11] miracle
[31:12] at the marriage of canaan
[31:14] amen
[31:15] then to the woman of samaria he
[31:17] discerned the thoughts and the intents
[31:19] of her heart
[31:20] amen
[31:21] and then he said john 6 he said except
[31:23] you eat my flesh and drink my blood you
[31:26] have no life in you and the bible says
[31:28] and many were no longer with him
[31:30] they wanted the the water being turned
[31:33] into wine
[31:34] they accepted the discerning of the
[31:37] thoughts and the intents of their heart
[31:39] but when the word was made flesh
[31:43] that was right there before them they
[31:44] couldn't take that
[31:46] and so is it with the seventh angel
[31:48] messenger i mean they wanted the first
[31:51] pull
[31:52] of the healing revival
[31:54] all the churches had accepted it
[31:57] they wanted the discerning of the
[31:59] thoughts and the intents of the ark
[32:01] everybody had accepted that but when it
[32:04] comes to the opening of the word
[32:06] that was rejected
[32:08] amen
[32:10] hallelujah praise god
[32:12] so now in the in the sixth seal
[32:17] paragraph 127
[32:19] he said that's the reason john wept so
[32:21] he's now talking about revelation
[32:23] chapter five
[32:25] because if no one could get that book
[32:28] all creation everything was gone
[32:31] she just simply turned back to atom and
[32:35] molecules and so forth and cosmic light
[32:38] and not even the creator the creation
[32:40] person nothing else because adam lost
[32:43] the right to the book
[32:46] so when adam break the conditional
[32:48] covenant he lost claim on the book of
[32:52] redemption
[32:53] are you with me
[32:55] he forfeited when
[32:57] he listened to his wife
[32:59] she listened to satan's reasoning
[33:02] instead of the word of god
[33:04] it was forfeited then it couldn't go
[33:07] back into the dirty hands of satan
[33:10] who tempted her out of the way
[33:13] so therefore it went right back in the
[33:15] original owner like any abstract deed
[33:19] would do
[33:20] goes right back to its original owner
[33:23] and that was god the creator who made it
[33:27] and
[33:28] he hold it
[33:29] is that right
[33:31] listen there is no man that can redeem
[33:34] you
[33:35] is that right there's only one that can
[33:38] redeem you as the one that take the book
[33:41] in revelation chapter 5 the lamb
[33:44] and it's a bloody lamb
[33:46] is it right
[33:47] now you see god made a law and then god
[33:50] would keep his own law
[33:53] what a god we serve
[33:55] he could have done otherwise
[33:57] but he made a law and he kept that law
[34:00] so god made a law that if there was sin
[34:04] it had to be paid for by debt
[34:07] the wages of sin is dead amen hallelujah
[34:12] oh we could go to romans and look at all
[34:14] of that really
[34:16] now in revelation chapter 5 1961 he said
[34:19] now a kinsman
[34:22] is under the seven seal book of
[34:24] redemption from the original
[34:27] owner amen who's the original owner
[34:30] almighty god
[34:32] amen
[34:33] when we lost it in the garden of eden
[34:36] through adam it went back into the
[34:38] original owner but there's been a
[34:41] torture
[34:43] on the land there's quarter
[34:45] and that was satan
[34:47] and he comes over hallelujah he's a
[34:50] portrait of this earth don't belong to
[34:53] satan
[34:54] it belongs to god but he's a porcher as
[34:57] quarter
[34:59] man
[35:00] oh i could say something right there but
[35:03] i better not he said the title deed of
[35:06] our redemption
[35:07] the seven seal book it's the title deed
[35:12] so oh it's breaking forth to you and i
[35:14] you wait till we get to those seals
[35:17] so listen so in all the ministry of the
[35:21] prophet
[35:22] the seventh scene was drawing him
[35:26] up into the presence
[35:28] hallelujah of that open book
[35:31] and so listen
[35:32] it's not as though it wasn't there no
[35:35] it was always there but it progressed
[35:39] until it reached that point
[35:41] hallelujah so we we talk about now the
[35:44] title deed
[35:46] a title
[35:47] it is a proof
[35:49] of ownership
[35:52] it says who holds it now
[35:56] hallelujah
[35:57] and the deed
[35:59] hallelujah is actually the the document
[36:03] that declare
[36:04] what that title and all the boundaries i
[36:07] said of that title
[36:09] amen
[36:10] so now we we talk about
[36:13] land deed
[36:15] you you know and i remember one time in
[36:18] jamaica when you when you bought a car
[36:21] it had actually a little book
[36:23] and and that book tells you
[36:25] all of the owner of that vehicle
[36:28] from the first time it will landed on
[36:30] the island
[36:31] until no your name is placed there
[36:34] so you could go back and look all the
[36:37] persons that had it before you
[36:39] amen
[36:40] ah my
[36:42] now so but an abstract title
[36:46] it talks about the original owner
[36:50] amen
[36:51] so so this one that one that one that
[36:53] one but there's an original owner
[36:58] you know sometimes to all all laws you
[37:00] know if a piece of land is clear lay
[37:02] vacant for a number of years you can go
[37:04] into the government and you can pay up
[37:07] all the taxes that is owed
[37:09] and if it's over seven years you can put
[37:11] a claim on it
[37:13] and you can actually develop a title for
[37:15] that piece of land
[37:17] but you're not the original owner
[37:20] is that right somebody can come behind
[37:23] you with an original document and claim
[37:26] i've got an abstract on it
[37:28] is that right
[37:29] oh that's where your life is this
[37:31] morning
[37:32] satan has been a squatter
[37:35] you came into the world speaking lies
[37:38] hallelujah but somebody's got an
[37:40] abstract on your life
[37:42] satan you were not my original owner
[37:45] god almighty had put me here for a
[37:48] purpose and there's a purpose for your
[37:51] life
[37:52] but satan admire your life because he
[37:55] knows that god had a plan for you
[37:58] i tell you this one thing
[38:01] when satan
[38:02] know that god has a mark on your life
[38:06] he will do anything
[38:08] tomorrow that life
[38:11] hello
[38:12] if he'll send a young man a drug
[38:15] a a young woman who got to prostitute
[38:17] herself
[38:19] because she don't yet know who she is
[38:22] is it right
[38:23] but the word of god is to bring you back
[38:27] to who you are
[38:29] when you realize you're you're not the
[38:31] devil's child but god have a purpose and
[38:34] a plan for your life
[38:36] isn't right then you start to recognize
[38:39] who you are
[38:40] amen
[38:42] hallelujah
[38:43] jesus
[38:45] my
[38:47] my
[38:48] oh so
[38:49] satan might have you this morning
[38:52] but god
[38:54] has got the abstract
[38:55] on your life
[38:57] and the earlier you recognize it
[39:00] you you know satan you're a liar
[39:03] you're a liar i am not a failure
[39:06] i am not a defeat
[39:07] i'm a promise
[39:09] and i'm a possibility
[39:12] amen only the god has a purpose there
[39:16] is it right
[39:17] oh he said you are you are falling
[39:19] amnesia
[39:21] because you have you have lost your way
[39:23] somewhere
[39:24] but they said the cure for amnesia is to
[39:27] bring you back to familiar places
[39:30] hallelujah
[39:31] let you see where you were before
[39:34] hallelujah
[39:35] so how does an abstract is made
[39:38] you see this condensed form of a real
[39:41] property history typically only include
[39:44] a summary of the original grant
[39:49] subsequent changes in ownership
[39:51] and any incumbent
[39:53] on that property
[39:55] and finally a statement
[39:57] by the person preparing the abstract
[40:00] that it is complete
[40:02] and accurate
[40:04] hallelujah
[40:06] i bought you with a price
[40:08] oh hallelujah
[40:10] amen
[40:11] and there was a sacrifice that was paid
[40:14] for your life
[40:16] no i see the message like this really
[40:19] you know in the church book it said the
[40:21] messenger comes to do two things
[40:23] according to malachi 4 to turn the out
[40:26] of the children
[40:27] we are the children back to the original
[40:30] pentecostal fathers
[40:32] and secondly according to revelation 10
[40:34] 7 to reveal the mysteries that are
[40:37] contained
[40:38] within the seven seals which are the
[40:40] seven thunders
[40:41] amen
[40:43] praise god
[40:44] so now
[40:46] you notice up to 1962 december brother
[40:49] preacher message sir is this the sign of
[40:52] the end time
[40:54] and what he did he went back to amen you
[40:57] know he kind of summarized his whole
[40:59] life and that old ministry of jesus
[41:01] christ and then he began to talk about
[41:03] the mysteries that are being hid
[41:05] from ages and generation
[41:07] and what mystery did he go to he got to
[41:10] the mystery of water baptism
[41:13] in the name of the lord jesus christ hey
[41:15] let me tell you the bible is not
[41:17] confused
[41:19] jesus said go into all the world
[41:21] and and preach the gospel and they that
[41:23] believe baptize them in the name of the
[41:26] father and of the son and of the holy
[41:28] ghost
[41:29] but there's a heavenly name
[41:32] hallelujah there's a name
[41:34] and that name is the lord jesus christ
[41:38] so the disciples were not confused when
[41:41] when peter said on the day of pentecost
[41:43] baptize them in the name of the lord
[41:45] jesus for the remission of their sins
[41:48] and they shall receive the gift of the
[41:50] holy ghost
[41:51] amen
[41:52] so he talked about the mystery of the
[41:55] godhead
[41:56] oh and what a great mystery that there's
[42:00] a god in three persons what idolatry
[42:04] when the bible said hear your israel the
[42:06] lord your god is one lord
[42:10] so it was bringing this hidden mystery
[42:12] no these hidden mystery were not all
[42:15] hidden
[42:16] they were churches
[42:18] that they believe these ones but they
[42:20] don't believe these ones they believe
[42:22] these ones but they don't believe these
[42:23] ones
[42:24] but god's bringing it people to
[42:27] perfection of himself
[42:30] where all the doctrines of the scripture
[42:33] has got to be identified in a people
[42:36] the people of god
[42:39] not some here and some there no no no
[42:41] but all of it really amen so he brought
[42:45] all those mistress together
[42:48] and so we take the whole council of god
[42:51] but with that we were restored malachi 4
[42:56] but we weren't complete because there
[42:58] had to be something to take us out of
[43:01] here
[43:03] so i preached a message by coleman
[43:06] the hidden mystery
[43:08] and the mystery of redemption
[43:10] hallelujah because there were hidden
[43:13] mysteries
[43:14] that were restored under malachi 4
[43:17] but there's a mystery of your redemption
[43:20] that is in the book of redemption
[43:23] hallelujah
[43:24] which
[43:25] contains revelation 10 from verse one to
[43:28] seven
[43:30] when he stepped down
[43:32] and when he sounded seven thunder hot of
[43:35] your voice
[43:36] and the prophet said now those seven
[43:38] thunder are the mysteries that are
[43:40] contained within the seals
[43:43] and that unlocks the mystery to take you
[43:47] out of here
[43:49] if we should believe
[43:51] all of that mystery
[43:53] that he speak of in december 1962 will
[43:56] be a great pentecostal church
[43:59] amen the gifts restored to the church
[44:02] and and all of that that we go on and
[44:04] teach psychology
[44:08] but there's more than that
[44:11] you see
[44:12] what the devil did to you
[44:16] he messed up your marriage
[44:19] you know in jamaica
[44:21] they said we we ain't got no marital
[44:23] problem because
[44:25] when people separate they poor people
[44:26] don't get divorced
[44:28] they just stay apart
[44:31] but but when she's got four or five
[44:33] children and there's five different
[44:35] fathers
[44:36] but she's never been married you got a
[44:38] big martial problem right there
[44:41] you see him saying
[44:43] because that first act
[44:46] was a marriage
[44:48] amen
[44:49] and so you've got a problem but you
[44:51] don't see it the devil has blinded your
[44:53] eyes
[44:55] and so satan is going to do everything
[44:57] to you
[44:58] to cause you not to be able to stand in
[45:01] confidence and find something and said
[45:03] ah i've been redeemed
[45:06] amen
[45:08] so something had to happen
[45:10] so moses had to go up on the mountain
[45:13] and meet god himself
[45:18] moses had to come down and look at the
[45:20] condition that they were in
[45:22] that it could never match the plan of
[45:24] god
[45:26] and moses had to take that authority by
[45:29] god himself that one i met upon the
[45:32] summit
[45:33] and released them of that curse
[45:36] that bind them
[45:38] and paul had to do the same thing
[45:41] brother branham
[45:42] he saw the condition
[45:45] but not until
[45:46] the seals were open
[45:49] then he could have taken that authority
[45:52] and what a great authority from god
[45:54] that says now
[45:56] that the clorox blood has been applied
[45:59] to your life
[46:00] and you've struck an abstract in god's
[46:03] word
[46:04] oh hallelujah
[46:06] amen
[46:07] they said ah but but uh but my mother
[46:09] and my father
[46:11] they were the key of my condemnation
[46:16] or they were never married
[46:18] so i said
[46:19] oh that act of adultery how could that
[46:21] be predestinated eternally
[46:24] so god had to take the clorox
[46:26] blood and put an abstract
[46:29] not in my mother and father
[46:32] he had to take me beyond that
[46:34] oh not too hard
[46:36] because adam had some problems with
[46:38] himself but he tamed me back to the mind
[46:40] of god and let me know that i'm an
[46:43] attribute of god
[46:44] [Applause]
[46:46] and all of god's attributes are perfect
[46:50] oh hallelujah
[46:51] how are you going to release me you're
[46:53] going to take me back to mind of god oh
[46:56] and that priest couldn't do it
[46:58] the bishops couldn't do it hallelujah
[47:01] they hadn't got the authority
[47:03] amen but god take his chosen man
[47:06] and say don't take the book
[47:09] oh and release them
[47:11] so he preached now that clorox blood
[47:16] hallelujah
[47:17] and he said that blood
[47:19] when it it's like the bleach
[47:22] hallelujah when it's dropped when you
[47:24] drop it into the ink
[47:25] it dispel everything of the
[47:28] you can't find it again
[47:30] it's gone
[47:32] hallelujah
[47:33] he was telling you who you are what a
[47:36] mystery but god gave the key
[47:39] hallelujah
[47:40] amen
[47:41] break forth the bread of life to you
[47:44] hallelujah that door you are guilty
[47:47] though every ordinance of this world
[47:49] were against you
[47:51] hallelujah when those seals were open
[47:54] and he preached that abstract title deed
[47:57] it was for a purpose
[48:00] to take you out of here
[48:02] that hallelujah
[48:04] that is not what my mama did
[48:06] hallelujah
[48:07] amen it's not what satan did in my life
[48:11] but it's what god did
[48:15] that's why that lamb
[48:17] hallelujah it was worthy to take back
[48:20] the book
[48:22] nobody could do it
[48:24] oh don't get it wrong brother branham
[48:26] never take that book
[48:28] no sir it was given to him
[48:30] it was already taken and open
[48:33] so he could preach your redemption
[48:36] hallelujah
[48:37] that tell me now
[48:39] when that seal is open
[48:41] and the clorox blood of jesus christ
[48:44] comes in effect and it gives me another
[48:46] title deed but he gives me that track
[48:50] and my record his search all the way
[48:53] back
[48:54] you can bring it back where you want it
[48:57] but he took it back into the mind of god
[49:00] and the bible declared to you and i whom
[49:03] you have for known
[49:05] they may also call and will be called
[49:08] they may justify them and will be
[49:10] justified then he also glorified
[49:13] what shall we say to these things
[49:16] if god be for us
[49:18] who can be against us
[49:25] all of you songwriters said
[49:28] for my records clear today
[49:30] for rewash my sins away
[49:33] [Music]
[49:35] hallelujah
[49:36] glory
[49:38] we thank god for the opening of the word
[49:41] that is what brings my redemption
[49:44] amen adam couldn't do it
[49:46] no he lost that book
[49:48] there's no prophet no priest
[49:51] and all the blood that was slain on
[49:53] jewish altar it still could do it
[49:56] but jesus christ himself
[49:59] and he gave john
[50:00] oh hallelujah
[50:02] that peak
[50:04] beyond the curtain
[50:06] hallelujah he saw
[50:08] that the lamb was worthy
[50:10] oh for revelation 5
[50:12] who is worthy
[50:14] who's were they
[50:15] to take the book
[50:17] why is the book important because the
[50:19] names of redeemed
[50:22] is right there in it
[50:24] hallelujah and if your name is closed up
[50:26] in the book you can't make
[50:28] amen the book has got to be open
[50:32] so may i say to you your names were
[50:34] written
[50:36] under the seals
[50:37] hallelujah
[50:39] so if the seal's not open
[50:41] oh are you going to have redemption
[50:44] you'll go around this mountain
[50:46] all the days of your life but you're
[50:49] locked in that chasm and you can't get
[50:51] out of it really because the blood is
[50:54] there to redeem you
[50:57] amen
[50:59] oh you see what i'm saying
[51:01] hallelujah
[51:02] so the breach between
[51:04] the church ages and the seals
[51:08] paragraph 116.
[51:10] he said the title deed to eternal life
[51:14] that's what it is not the church
[51:16] programs
[51:18] no no
[51:19] no not to be a member of a church but
[51:22] the title deed to eternal life and he
[51:25] said that abstract title deed to eternal
[51:28] life
[51:29] when adam forfeited
[51:31] for wisdom instead of faith
[51:34] it went back into the hands of of the
[51:36] whole almighty god
[51:38] what a great thing
[51:40] hallelujah
[51:41] amen in the hands of god waiting for
[51:44] redemption claim
[51:49] amen praise god he made a way
[51:53] hallelujah of redemption he made a way
[51:55] back and someday the redeemer
[51:59] is to take it back
[52:01] you see where
[52:03] we are getting to now we'll watch this
[52:05] fellow sitting on the throne
[52:08] waiting for redemption claim
[52:10] what is this book of redemption
[52:13] this title deed abstract title deed we
[52:17] don't just want to say title deed but
[52:19] the abstract title did it search all the
[52:23] way back
[52:24] to the original owner
[52:29] tell me which one of you this morning
[52:30] never came into this world speaking lies
[52:33] i don't care how religious your
[52:35] appearance is
[52:36] and some of you would like us though all
[52:38] the days of your life you are righteous
[52:40] you're a liar
[52:44] hallelujah amen
[52:47] a little chillax grandma said grandma
[52:50] where's your husband i ain't got none
[52:52] then how did you have my daddy
[52:56] ah
[52:57] there's a revelation
[52:59] there's something coming out
[53:01] begin to look through
[53:02] the realities of life
[53:04] something's wrong somewhere
[53:06] and something was wrong in your life
[53:08] how did you come into the world speaking
[53:10] lies then you ain't gonna teach no baby
[53:12] to lie no he'd hold the thing right
[53:15] behind him and you're seeing i said i
[53:17] got it
[53:19] god didn't do that
[53:21] no because he was born in sin
[53:24] in conception you might have been
[53:25] praying but still born in sin
[53:28] amen
[53:29] because it was
[53:31] born after the fall
[53:33] is that right and you're all born in
[53:36] that fall
[53:37] there's like oh there's no virgin birth
[53:39] you don't lie
[53:40] amen
[53:41] i don't care how religious you are
[53:43] amen so you're born in sin and shamed in
[53:46] iniquity are you coming to the world
[53:48] speaking lies
[53:50] oh david said in sin did my mother
[53:52] conceive me
[53:54] he said that means they weren't married
[53:55] no no no they were married but it's
[53:57] still in sin
[53:58] because if you even if you can't speak
[54:00] your children by the word
[54:03] then they're born by
[54:04] hallelujah sinful desires
[54:07] is that right
[54:08] amen so it's waiting for redemption
[54:11] claim
[54:12] what is this book a redemption it's a
[54:15] title deed that abstract titled it
[54:17] abstract what does that mean means it is
[54:21] searched all the way back to the
[54:23] beginning
[54:25] amen
[54:26] hallelujah is it like that little drop
[54:29] of ink this morning i preach that he
[54:32] says
[54:32] hallelujah these things are for a
[54:34] purpose
[54:37] there was a reason behind all of that
[54:40] it did not just pick something off the
[54:42] shelf and say i'm gonna preach this this
[54:44] morning no there was a purpose
[54:48] hallelujah and you were in that purpose
[54:51] by the drop of ink this morning when it
[54:53] struck that bleach it went all the way
[54:56] back
[54:57] and when sin has been confessed
[55:00] hallelujah and falling into the blood of
[55:03] jesus christ oh my
[55:05] it gives an abstract right straight back
[55:07] to the creator again
[55:12] when sin is confessed
[55:14] and going to the blood of jesus christ
[55:16] i say this to you now that when god
[55:19] gives you the seal
[55:21] of the holy ghost
[55:23] amen
[55:25] everything that you need until the day
[55:27] of your redemption is in you
[55:30] are you gonna have pitfalls yes
[55:33] are you still going to be truthful every
[55:34] day no you're going to lie sometimes
[55:37] amen
[55:39] you're going to be frustrated you're
[55:40] going to be sick
[55:42] all kinds of things is going to happen
[55:43] to this man but when you receive the
[55:45] holy ghost your soul is sealed
[55:49] hallelujah
[55:50] your soul is sealed
[55:53] but you're walking
[55:54] for this body's redemption
[55:57] and satan is doing everything with you
[56:00] to stop you but revelation
[56:03] take you out of here
[56:05] amen
[56:06] it's a revelation
[56:08] that is sealing you
[56:10] when you know
[56:12] that lord i got them struggles
[56:14] i pray and i never was recovered
[56:17] hallelujah lord i did this i did this
[56:20] but lord i repented because there's
[56:23] something inside of me
[56:25] that i can't sin i can't do wrong and
[56:28] and go to my bed and rest like a baby
[56:30] there's something in me
[56:32] that hey
[56:34] come on old man
[56:35] you got to send it right
[56:37] is that right hallelujah
[56:40] glory to god and because of that
[56:43] amen sin confess
[56:45] and put in the clorox blood of jesus
[56:47] christ
[56:48] it creates an abstract
[56:52] he said but brother king
[56:53] that was that abstract you see
[56:55] because god knows everything that you're
[56:59] going to have
[57:00] every revelation that god is going to
[57:02] reveal to you
[57:04] about you
[57:05] it's in the birth
[57:09] when you're born again
[57:11] you always
[57:13] was eternal
[57:15] amen
[57:16] you always was eternal
[57:19] hallelujah then the presence of the
[57:22] seventh seal the capstone is drawing you
[57:25] through experiences really oh hallelujah
[57:29] abraham god gave him at the start i'm
[57:32] going to bless you
[57:34] oh glory
[57:36] but but he had some pitfalls he carried
[57:38] lot
[57:39] he carried a whole lot of package with
[57:41] him that god didn't call but god let
[57:44] them drop off one by one and so he began
[57:47] to straighten up
[57:49] hallelujah so when the two angels went
[57:51] down to south the bible said abram stood
[57:53] yet in the presence of the lord
[57:57] amen
[57:58] he's going to test your faith to the
[57:59] final point
[58:01] is that right
[58:03] hallelujah
[58:04] amen
[58:06] glory to god
[58:07] yes sir abstract title deed is held in
[58:10] the hands of almighty god
[58:14] amen
[58:15] its redemption means all legal
[58:18] possession of all that was lost by adam
[58:21] and eve
[58:23] that all to make a born again christian
[58:26] hallelujah
[58:28] amen all legal possession to the
[58:30] abstract deed the title deed of eternal
[58:33] life means that you possess everything
[58:35] that adam and eve lost
[58:39] hallelujah
[58:40] and so god now oh my
[58:43] it's showing it to you
[58:45] so in the life of jesus in the life of a
[58:48] prophet
[58:49] he's showing you
[58:51] that you don't just come to the first
[58:53] and second pull
[58:54] but you heat the flesh of the son of man
[58:57] and you drink his blood
[58:58] amen
[59:00] and so in that third poll
[59:02] there is your salvation
[59:05] your healing
[59:07] resurrection
[59:09] dominion
[59:10] creation
[59:12] all that belongs to you
[59:17] brother there's just a little veil
[59:19] a little veil
[59:21] that is holding us back
[59:24] to call
[59:25] the dead ones from the grave
[59:29] hallelujah
[59:31] but we've got to get out of ourselves
[59:33] this is what's holding us
[59:35] amen
[59:37] but when god revealed to you all
[59:40] that he's going to restore to you
[59:43] then watch the redemption plan coming
[59:46] manifestation
[59:48] hallelujah
[59:49] identification 1964 he saw there was
[59:52] nothing in heaven
[59:54] that could have done
[59:56] you know john look the book there the
[59:59] bible oh and he said the book the bible
[1:00:03] because there's no secret book
[1:00:05] it's there in the word because he's a
[1:00:07] word
[1:00:08] hallelujah
[1:00:09] amen
[1:00:10] yes sir and we find that he saw there
[1:00:13] was no one
[1:00:15] up on earth that was worthy to take the
[1:00:17] book
[1:00:18] the book of redemption you see that's
[1:00:21] why the prophet said when the seals were
[1:00:22] opened the bible becomes a new book
[1:00:28] you know in my family i've got a lot of
[1:00:30] preachers i realize
[1:00:32] i've got nieces who are preachers
[1:00:34] my brother is a preacher
[1:00:36] you know and i listen to them
[1:00:39] preach and i'll see how they been
[1:00:41] trained by theology they take the word
[1:00:44] and what they do with it
[1:00:46] you know
[1:00:48] but i see how the book
[1:00:50] that we hope on the same book
[1:00:52] and though they open the pages
[1:00:54] the revelation of the book is close to
[1:00:57] them
[1:01:00] and they talk about trivial things and
[1:01:03] and so really
[1:01:04] because
[1:01:05] they they can't strike the abstract
[1:01:09] because they have never started out
[1:01:11] right
[1:01:12] amen
[1:01:13] they have never received that revelation
[1:01:16] now christ the minister of god reveal
[1:01:18] 5 24
[1:01:20] now you see the seals
[1:01:22] when he was in the minitorial work back
[1:01:25] there redeeming
[1:01:27] but someday he comes forth
[1:01:30] to get his book this book that he's
[1:01:33] redeemed
[1:01:35] and all that's in the book would be him
[1:01:38] hallelujah
[1:01:39] amen
[1:01:41] all that's in the book would be him for
[1:01:44] that's the believer the word in the book
[1:01:48] and the word is him
[1:01:51] you are christ christ in you is a hope
[1:01:53] of glory
[1:01:55] hallelujah
[1:01:56] he comes forth from this book of
[1:01:59] redemption
[1:02:00] whose names are are written on the book
[1:02:03] before the foundation of the world when
[1:02:05] he was slain
[1:02:07] as a lamb
[1:02:08] that john showed you in revelation
[1:02:10] chapter five
[1:02:12] you come forth
[1:02:13] when he opened that book there was your
[1:02:16] redemption
[1:02:17] you weren't born yet
[1:02:19] but that can't stop you
[1:02:21] so you see we are putting focus on
[1:02:23] people because they they were there with
[1:02:25] the prophet they know the prophet they
[1:02:27] they said ah the prophet tell me
[1:02:29] something that he never tell nobody will
[1:02:31] keep it amen
[1:02:35] because don't think that make you
[1:02:37] anything
[1:02:38] because here here's the book
[1:02:42] and this book is going to be open to you
[1:02:44] and i
[1:02:46] is that right
[1:02:47] also we're looking at this one and that
[1:02:48] one and that one and and before when the
[1:02:51] prophet leave of the scene what was
[1:02:52] there was the acts of the prophet
[1:02:54] because we were still blinded
[1:02:57] and those who sit there when he preached
[1:02:59] the seal they were still blinded to what
[1:03:02] he was saying
[1:03:03] but the word of god cannot return to a
[1:03:06] void
[1:03:07] it must accomplish what god pleased so
[1:03:10] you have to stay there
[1:03:11] until you realize
[1:03:13] it's not what he go to haunt it's not
[1:03:16] the little things he talk about
[1:03:18] no that's just an attraction but the
[1:03:20] word that he declared to you
[1:03:23] it contained your redemption
[1:03:26] [Applause]
[1:03:29] hallelujah
[1:03:31] listen
[1:03:33] you know people look at things and try
[1:03:34] to prove this today and prove that
[1:03:36] you cannot prove spiritual things with
[1:03:39] scientifical means
[1:03:41] it will never come out for when the
[1:03:44] doctors say
[1:03:46] you've got that problem
[1:03:48] and you're going to live three months
[1:03:50] by the inspiration of the holy ghost as
[1:03:53] dumb as i am
[1:03:55] i take the holy ghost and i tell you you
[1:03:57] shall live
[1:03:59] tell the doctor though look again
[1:04:01] because it's going to be different next
[1:04:03] time
[1:04:04] amen
[1:04:06] i serve a god who can call back the dead
[1:04:08] let the doctor explain that to me
[1:04:11] amen
[1:04:12] who can take cells in your body that is
[1:04:14] corrupted they call it tumor cancer and
[1:04:17] speak to them and they're gone
[1:04:19] let the science explain that
[1:04:22] oh they say can't be but i tell you it
[1:04:24] is go check again amen
[1:04:27] because god has more power than what you
[1:04:29] think
[1:04:31] amen
[1:04:32] he's restoring the world back to us and
[1:04:35] brethren let me tell don't get called
[1:04:36] and formal because with the restoration
[1:04:38] of the world he said it's a restoration
[1:04:41] of the power and you shall receive power
[1:04:44] after that the holy ghost has come upon
[1:04:45] you
[1:04:50] i'll say this though
[1:04:52] we're not the only people that manifest
[1:04:54] the power of the holy ghost
[1:04:56] but it doesn't matter how much
[1:04:58] manifestation you have if you ain't got
[1:05:00] this word you cannot unlock your
[1:05:02] redemption to the abstract
[1:05:05] amen
[1:05:06] that's what makes the bride different
[1:05:08] from all of the church
[1:05:10] amen
[1:05:11] that i said ah well you know everybody's
[1:05:14] going to make it everybody if you just
[1:05:16] have love everybody's going to make it
[1:05:17] you're going to make the rapture
[1:05:19] no
[1:05:20] because the one that went up in the
[1:05:22] rapture you've got to be in him
[1:05:25] hallelujah
[1:05:28] it's the rising of the sun
[1:05:30] page 65 paragraph 246
[1:05:32] like the pentecostal experience today
[1:05:34] and the coming of the holy spirit holy
[1:05:36] ghost in the last day as promised it's
[1:05:39] like the abstract
[1:05:41] to the title deed
[1:05:43] now you can get a title

[1:05:48] that still don't say that it's yours no
[1:05:51] sir
[1:05:52] somebody
[1:05:53] may back yonder could have come in and
[1:05:55] and put a claim on it but when you get
[1:05:58] an abstract that shows that everything
[1:06:01] that's ever against it is struck off
[1:06:05] plumb back to the foundation
[1:06:09] and so that's what the bride need this
[1:06:11] morning
[1:06:12] we need an abstract
[1:06:14] that everything that you have ever
[1:06:15] committed
[1:06:16] hallelujah you see satan they accuse of
[1:06:19] the brethren so he comes up and he said
[1:06:21] uh where dale there was one time he
[1:06:23] backslid
[1:06:25] you know that's the truth
[1:06:26] and so he's pointing it in the face of

[1:06:40] that's when you had him
[1:06:42] hallelujah but take him beyond that
[1:06:45] hallelujah so they said when he said oh
[1:06:48] let there be who was he talking with i
[1:06:50] was a part of his attribute
[1:06:53] and notice in genesis one he said and
[1:06:55] let them before eve was taken out of
[1:06:58] adam
[1:07:00] hallelujah
[1:07:01] because oh glory to god so now you know
[1:07:04] i'm a part of my savior i'm a part of
[1:07:08] his word
[1:07:09] it's a revelation
[1:07:12] that's my predestination
[1:07:14] if my god never foreknown me before the
[1:07:17] foundation of the world
[1:07:19] he's not god
[1:07:21] but he knows the end as though it's the
[1:07:22] beginning
[1:07:24] hallelujah i'm going to jump i might
[1:07:27] miss you i received the deed but when
[1:07:30] the holy ghost come
[1:07:31] it was the abstract that everything
[1:07:34] against me whether my mother done it
[1:07:36] whether my father done it whether my
[1:07:38] grandparents don't my grandmother done
[1:07:40] it
[1:07:41] hallelujah
[1:07:43] i don't care who did it
[1:07:44] because i'm not go i'm not redeemed
[1:07:47] there
[1:07:48] i'm redeemed before my mother know my
[1:07:51] father
[1:07:52] i'm redeemed before
[1:07:55] adam fall
[1:07:57] i go back into the mind of god as an
[1:08:00] attribute of god not you the person
[1:08:03] but the germ of god in you
[1:08:06] hallelujah
[1:08:07] amen but when the abstract comes it
[1:08:10] struck off omitted everything i'm an
[1:08:12] abstract holder now hallelujah the
[1:08:15] abstract all my sins are struck out all
[1:08:19] your sins are struck out the blood of
[1:08:21] jesus christ and the holy ghost has come
[1:08:24] as an abstract to the title deed that
[1:08:27] god give me by grace
[1:08:31] bye for knowledge
[1:08:32] oh my
[1:08:34] hallelujah
[1:08:36] 252 he said the abstract title the debt
[1:08:39] is settled
[1:08:41] amen
[1:08:42] that debt is settled everything against
[1:08:45] it has been struck off
[1:08:47] amen
[1:08:48] hallelujah he becomes sin for me whom
[1:08:50] knew said that i might become the
[1:08:52] righteousness of god in him
[1:08:55] amen he took my place that i through
[1:08:58] grace might take his
[1:09:00] is that right
[1:09:02] you see we've got a fear we've got a
[1:09:03] fear we've got a fear
[1:09:05] we've got a fear that if we say what the
[1:09:08] word says
[1:09:10] people are going to think that i've got
[1:09:12] eternal life and there's nothing i've
[1:09:14] got to do listen but if you've got the
[1:09:16] holy ghost
[1:09:19] paul said i've got the power to leader
[1:09:21] to lead around a woman
[1:09:24] but the holy ghost in him never want to
[1:09:26] do it
[1:09:28] that holy ghost is where you recognize
[1:09:31] who you are
[1:09:33] and it changed your desires
[1:09:36] is that right
[1:09:38] so so i could do it but i ain't got no
[1:09:40] desire for that
[1:09:41] amen because christ in me is a hope of
[1:09:45] glory
[1:09:46] you see when the holy ghost comes truly
[1:09:49] there is truly a metamorphosis that take
[1:09:52] place
[1:09:53] because you you can look back at who you
[1:09:55] are and many times said when when i was
[1:09:58] 18 years old and sitting out there on
[1:10:00] the bench at my first job and the
[1:10:02] minister comes to me and sit behind me
[1:10:04] and he begins to witness to me and he
[1:10:05] begins to tell me you know about jesus
[1:10:07] christ and so and i was a good old
[1:10:09] baptist
[1:10:10] and i began to tell him on my fingers
[1:10:12] some problems i had you know why i i
[1:10:14] just can't surrender my life to jesus i
[1:10:17] can remember i reach about number 18.
[1:10:20] you know wise
[1:10:21] crack you know amen i reach number
[1:10:24] eighteen but you know but when i said
[1:10:26] yes to jesus and many times try to
[1:10:29] remember what did i tell him i don't
[1:10:32] remember
[1:10:34] but he took my sins
[1:10:36] and he put that he took my burden
[1:10:38] he took my cross he took everything that
[1:10:40] i and he put in the sea of his
[1:10:42] forgetfulness never to be remembered no
[1:10:46] more
[1:10:46] oh i said i'm redeemed
[1:10:49] redeem our love to proclaim it i'm
[1:10:52] redeemed by the blood of the lamb
[1:10:55] hallelujah not just the blood that watch
[1:10:57] but like clorox blood
[1:10:59] that when it strikes in
[1:11:01] it dispel it
[1:11:03] nothing of it can be found
[1:11:06] hallelujah and when he dispelled my sin
[1:11:09] he gave me an abstract by the opening of
[1:11:11] the word and hear us stand today
[1:11:14] i'm standing on the word of almighty god
[1:11:18] hallelujah can't you see why i'm happy
[1:11:20] have accepted the word of the lord the
[1:11:23] revealed word that was spoken by the
[1:11:25] prophet of malachi 4.
[1:11:29] hallelujah
[1:11:31] that's it
[1:11:32] so the bible becomes a new book because
[1:11:35] now when i read it i'm reading of him
[1:11:38] and i'm reading of myself
[1:11:40] hallelujah
[1:11:41] although when he preached christ the
[1:11:43] mystery of god revealed
[1:11:45] i was a part of that mystery
[1:11:48] listen the cherubims didn't believe you
[1:11:50] could make it
[1:11:51] the seraphim didn't believe you can make
[1:11:53] it the elders didn't believe you can
[1:11:55] make it that is why there was silence in
[1:11:57] heaven for half an hour when he comes to
[1:12:00] me
[1:12:02] hallelujah because the angels never sin
[1:12:05] they had nothing to repent but for me to
[1:12:08] go through what i go through and come
[1:12:10] out spotless like gold hallelujah
[1:12:13] it had to be the grace of almighty god
[1:12:16] that's why he says oh hallelujah it's
[1:12:19] not by me but he said the capstone will
[1:12:21] come crying grace
[1:12:23] grace unto it because i did not put
[1:12:25] grace into it none of us could make it
[1:12:28] but by the grace of god
[1:12:30] hallelujah everything that's against you
[1:12:33] oh i'm gonna close now with the easter
[1:12:34] seal hallelujah 1965 paragraph run on
[1:12:38] hate he said it's the holy spirit today
[1:12:41] hunting out honest hearts that will

[1:12:46] there is a message that messages jesus
[1:12:49] christ
[1:12:51] amen
[1:12:52] and that message is not right just to
[1:12:54] 1962 no it takes all of the word
[1:12:59] oh he said there were portraits on our
[1:13:01] land
[1:13:02] satan is there and because of that
[1:13:05] there's many counterfeit that has run
[1:13:07] the mark
[1:13:09] oh you go places that you talk about the
[1:13:11] third pull
[1:13:13] the seven thunders
[1:13:15] people get stuck up in a cocoon
[1:13:18] because they think you're going to say
[1:13:20] something that is way off the word
[1:13:23] but if there was a counterfeit there's
[1:13:26] got to be a genuine
[1:13:27] amen
[1:13:29] you're not going to take me off
[1:13:31] my predestinated position because
[1:13:34] somebody has go off the word no i
[1:13:36] believe in my position and you can't
[1:13:39] take me from that

[1:13:42] poll
[1:13:44] amen
[1:13:45] i believe in a life
[1:13:47] ministry
[1:13:48] i don't believe that brother branham's
[1:13:49] got to come back to establish anything
[1:13:52] because the bible says in revelation 10
[1:13:54] 7 the mystery of god will be finished
[1:13:59] it is finished it is settled
[1:14:01] it's for you to take the mystery of the
[1:14:04] word and apply to yourself
[1:14:07] it's in you it is there
[1:14:10] and the word is being restored
[1:14:13] back to the believer

[1:14:36] and be glad and give honor unto him for
[1:14:39] the marriage of the lamb has come and
[1:14:41] the wife has made herself ready
[1:14:43] we are married to jesus christ the world
[1:14:48] hallelujah
[1:14:49] we're not waiting on a priest to come
[1:14:51] and holy holy holy oh bless you bless
[1:14:54] you no no no we have jesus christ
[1:14:57] himself
[1:14:58] hallelujah yes sir
[1:15:00] hallelujah amen for the truthful mystery
[1:15:03] of god that god revealed himself
[1:15:05] completely in jesus christ
[1:15:09] hallelujah
[1:15:10] amen that christ might have preeminence
[1:15:14] among the body of believers
[1:15:16] amen
[1:15:17] that he might restore us to eden as if
[1:15:20] there was no fall
[1:15:21] hallelujah
[1:15:23] now look at your position
[1:15:25] of eliezer
[1:15:27] and isaac
[1:15:29] eliezer
[1:15:31] was sent
[1:15:32] by abraham
[1:15:34] to find a bride
[1:15:36] for isaac
[1:15:38] you you know
[1:15:40] hallelujah sarah died
[1:15:42] and abram had remarried
[1:15:45] but here was isaac
[1:15:47] he's grieving over his mama
[1:15:50] so abram see the need
[1:15:52] that you need a wife to move on from
[1:15:54] there
[1:15:55] so you let eliezer make the promise
[1:15:58] promise me
[1:15:59] you won't take a wife from among these
[1:16:01] why dwell
[1:16:03] but go to
[1:16:05] my homeland
[1:16:06] i might need to do that for my girls
[1:16:08] amen
[1:16:11] i wonder sometimes if they're looking
[1:16:13] amen but go back to my home and don't
[1:16:16] tell them that i said that you know go
[1:16:17] back to my homeland
[1:16:19] and here it is eliezer took that
[1:16:22] responsibility and he said lord let it
[1:16:24] be that when i go there
[1:16:26] when i do this let her do that then i
[1:16:29] will know it's a vindication of what god
[1:16:31] wants
[1:16:33] hallelujah and when he met rebecca
[1:16:36] hallelujah oh and he said
[1:16:38] ah give me a drink of water she also
[1:16:41] watered the camel
[1:16:42] but but he had to go to the parents and
[1:16:44] i said uh let her let her steal she said
[1:16:46] i will go
[1:16:48] there was something that was calling her
[1:16:51] you you could have stayed over in the
[1:16:52] church a little longer
[1:16:54] but i will go
[1:16:56] i'm going to a land i don't know i'm
[1:16:58] going to a people i don't know i'm going
[1:17:00] into a message hallelujah that i don't
[1:17:03] understand but something tell me
[1:17:05] that my birthrate is there in the world
[1:17:08] and i'm taking all of it
[1:17:11] i let nobody tell you because they were
[1:17:12] there before you that they've got
[1:17:14] anything more than what you've got
[1:17:16] because god ain't got no grandchildren
[1:17:19] amen
[1:17:20] we are sons and daughters of god amen
[1:17:23] and god will give you your portion
[1:17:26] hallelujah
[1:17:28] amen
[1:17:29] you know my
[1:17:30] last trip to uganda
[1:17:33] oh there's wonderful brothers
[1:17:36] good preachers
[1:17:37] but but i know today they
[1:17:39] they love the manifestation of the holy
[1:17:41] spirit
[1:17:43] and you know in september
[1:17:45] 2019 when i was there
[1:17:47] i went with two brothers to preach what
[1:17:50] i did not know
[1:17:51] from kenya
[1:17:53] and i preached the first service
[1:17:55] and the brother
[1:17:57] very senior minister he was preaching
[1:17:58] the secretary he said
[1:18:00] in pentecost we had seen manifestation
[1:18:03] but but i never really see anything
[1:18:05] since i come to the message
[1:18:07] he said we pray for people and they go
[1:18:08] to the doctor and we don't know if it's
[1:18:10] the poor or the medicine that healed
[1:18:13] them
[1:18:15] i i tell you that that place of about a
[1:18:17] thousand and a half people
[1:18:19] amen their fate was dash
[1:18:21] you know
[1:18:22] so i felt responsibility and i go
[1:18:25] amen and i preached the manifestation of
[1:18:28] the holy spirit
[1:18:30] amen
[1:18:32] you know first of all the pastor
[1:18:34] he said brother
[1:18:35] i received the holy ghost you were so
[1:18:38] happy
[1:18:41] amen
[1:18:42] people were not only born again
[1:18:45] but sicknesses were being healed
[1:18:48] and the manifest that the power of
[1:18:50] almighty god
[1:18:51] came down
[1:18:53] because when you put the word to the
[1:18:54] test all god wants is somebody to
[1:18:57] believe and to take him at his word
[1:19:00] hallelujah
[1:19:03] the power of god moved through that
[1:19:06] place
[1:19:07] manifestation after manifestation
[1:19:10] oh hallelujah
[1:19:12] but you know
[1:19:13] so i went back at easter
[1:19:16] this easter
[1:19:18] and i said you know the people
[1:19:22] believe in the manifestation of the holy
[1:19:24] spirit but to the message of the hour
[1:19:26] there was more than that
[1:19:29] if the words not open
[1:19:32] we can say the words of the prophet we
[1:19:34] can quote the courts we can do anything
[1:19:36] we want
[1:19:38] but there's a revelation of the word of
[1:19:40] god to take you out of here
[1:19:43] amen
[1:19:44] it's useless you'll sit in a message
[1:19:46] church and miss the rapture
[1:19:49] because we must take the revelation of
[1:19:50] the word of god this message come to
[1:19:53] prepare a bride for a rapture and how
[1:19:55] did he prepare a bride for the rapture
[1:19:57] because he went and take the abstract
[1:20:00] title deed
[1:20:02] receive it to yourself and your record
[1:20:04] is searched all the way back to the mind
[1:20:06] of god
[1:20:07] then there is nothing
[1:20:09] to stop you
[1:20:10] hallelujah from going into that rapture
[1:20:14] and so i preached the opening of the
[1:20:16] word
[1:20:18] i tell you i preached seven services
[1:20:20] it was hard for one person
[1:20:23] because they pulled the life out of you
[1:20:25] amen
[1:20:27] praise god
[1:20:28] but the minister says
[1:20:30] that was certainly a help to them really
[1:20:33] to realize that this message
[1:20:36] is not just the first and the second
[1:20:38] pull
[1:20:39] no
[1:20:41] it is a turtle the opening of the word
[1:20:43] christ
[1:20:44] himself hallelujah
[1:20:47] condescend
[1:20:49] and uniting with the bride
[1:20:51] hallelujah and that's what the seventh
[1:20:53] seal was for
[1:20:55] he comes to me
[1:20:57] personally
[1:20:58] hallelujah the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:21:02] incarnated into the person
[1:21:04] of jesus christ the bride pregnanted
[1:21:08] with the seed word of god
[1:21:10] amen it's in you
[1:21:12] in you
[1:21:13] hallelujah
[1:21:14] and in christ the mystery of god
[1:21:16] revealed become personal
[1:21:19] amen
[1:21:21] because not only it shows you who christ
[1:21:24] is but it shows you who you are
[1:21:28] and you take your saint john 14 20 in
[1:21:32] that day
[1:21:34] that's personal when he comes to me when
[1:21:37] that word breaks loose in my life
[1:21:40] and that birth of that word
[1:21:43] and i know
[1:21:45] it is him
[1:21:47] so you can tell me anything you want to
[1:21:48] say about the cloud
[1:21:52] about the bear
[1:21:54] that has no effect on me
[1:21:57] because the womb of life
[1:21:59] is already sealed
[1:22:01] said no false doctrine can come in
[1:22:04] you know who you are
[1:22:06] amen
[1:22:07] brother branham is not the the prophet
[1:22:10] of the 5-4 ministry
[1:22:13] he's a dispensational prophet
[1:22:16] amen
[1:22:18] that has a word
[1:22:19] and a prophet is not only a seal piece
[1:22:22] of trumpet but it's a reveal of the word
[1:22:25] of god that is written in his life
[1:22:28] amen
[1:22:29] so he come to call a bride he is our
[1:22:32] eliezer
[1:22:34] rebecca never fall in love with eliasa
[1:22:37] no it was for isaac
[1:22:41] we need to be careful we don't go into
[1:22:43] idolatry
[1:22:44] we've got this tongue there that hang
[1:22:46] there that hang there that hang there it
[1:22:48] is a life
[1:22:50] of jesus christ in you
[1:22:52] amen
[1:22:54] not just words but come to us not in
[1:22:56] words only but in power and
[1:22:58] demonstration of the holy ghost
[1:23:01] then challenge yourself to the word of
[1:23:03] god
[1:23:04] he's your healer
[1:23:06] is your deliverer
[1:23:08] amen he's a problem solver
[1:23:11] he's a brother and bearer
[1:23:13] he is your completion
[1:23:15] the amen
[1:23:17] of the amen
[1:23:19] hallelujah
[1:23:22] so let us cross the veil
[1:23:24] into the abstract then you know
[1:23:27] the make known age i know
[1:23:30] that it's not what i did yesterday
