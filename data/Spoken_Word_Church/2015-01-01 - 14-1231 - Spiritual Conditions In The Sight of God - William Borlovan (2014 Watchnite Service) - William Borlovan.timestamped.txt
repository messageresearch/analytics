[25:54] you come back again you don't get
[25:56] welcomed

[26:00] part of us anyway because we don't have
[26:02] anything here to join or membership or
[26:05] anything we're just part of the body of
[26:06] Christ so you come two times you're part
[26:08] of us so we appreciate all of you coming
[26:10] appreciate all of the brothers and
[26:13] sisters coming with brother

[26:17] away and I think some from Florida and
[26:20] the different things and all over the
[26:22] South Carolina's and all to be with us
[26:24] tonight we pray that the Lord would
[26:26] bless you for coming and you know open
[26:30] your eyes and let our hearts and lives
[26:32] be set on him there's probably one for
[26:35] the other you know we got all these flus
[26:36] and bugs and coming goings you know but
[26:40] the Lord will take care of them all
[26:41] because he's the Healer amen and we
[26:43] believe that remember now the order of
[26:46] announcements remember this coming uh
[26:49] Saturday will be Bible study so we'll be
[26:52] here at six o'clock if you want to
[26:54] Fellowship together in Bible study it
[26:57] and then remember that remember Wade
[26:59] will be starting a series on the stature
[27:03] of a perfect man starting this coming
[27:05] Sunday morning and he will be covering
[27:09] the Sunday services for whatever time he
[27:13] needs to cover and you know then we'll
[27:17] fill in on the Wednesdays and try to
[27:19] help a little bit but you'll be doing
[27:22] that because he's going to go into a
[27:25] series on the Statue of a perfect man
[27:27] carrying it all the way through I
[27:28] believe it will be very enlightening
[27:31] unto you and help you to understand the
[27:35] scripture that our word that we read and
[27:37] we look at of you know add to your faith
[27:39] virtual knowledge Temperance patience
[27:40] godliness brotherly kindness Etc
[27:43] so just remember that and come and be
[27:45] with us and have a good time in the Lord
[27:47] you're ready to go into the word because
[27:49] what we do is we we tried years ago
[27:53] singing a long time and then
[27:55] letting the preacher preach a while and
[27:57] we found out everybody was already give
[28:00] out time the preacher got to the pulpit
[28:02] so we changed our way of doing we have
[28:05] the little song service 30 minutes then
[28:07] we get the preacher to the pulpit and
[28:10] he's only got three hours then to preach
[28:12] so he's the one that'll have to
[28:14] determine that part you know but then we
[28:18] will sing and have a good time
[28:20] fellowshipping together on into the
[28:23] Midnight Hour and be able to try to take
[28:25] communion right around the Midnight Hour
[28:27] but it has been here that we took
[28:30] communion at 1 30 because we didn't get
[28:32] caught up quick enough but that's all
[28:34] right there's nothing to do with it you

[32:19] amen
[32:20] that's what we want to do God bless
[32:23] y'all again let's turn if you would just
[32:24] to get right in the word
[32:27] to Genesis
[32:28] chapter 2.
[32:32] start verse 18.
[32:39] and the Lord God said
[32:42] it is not good that man should be alone
[32:44] I will make and help me for him and out
[32:47] of the ground the Lord God formed every
[32:49] beast of the field and every fowl of the
[32:51] air and brought them into Adam to see
[32:53] what he would call them and whatsoever
[32:55] Adam called every living creature that
[32:58] was the name thereof
[33:00] and Adam gave names to all cattle and to
[33:03] the fowl of the air and to every beast
[33:05] of the field but for Adam there was not
[33:07] found and helped meat for him
[33:09] and the Lord God caused a deep sleep to
[33:12] fall upon Adam and he slept and he took
[33:14] one of his ribs and closed up the flesh
[33:16] instead thereof
[33:18] and the rib which the Lord God had taken
[33:21] from man made he a woman and brought her
[33:24] unto the man
[33:25] and Adam said this is now a bone of my
[33:27] bones and Flesh of My Flesh she shall be
[33:30] called woman
[33:31] because she was taken out of man
[33:34] therefore shall a man leave his father
[33:36] and his mother and shall cleave unto his
[33:37] wife and they shall be one flesh
[33:40] and they were both naked the man and his
[33:43] wife and were not ashamed amen let's
[33:46] bear our heads to him in prayer the most
[33:48] gracious Heavenly Father Lord we are
[33:49] again so grateful to you Lord to be able
[33:52] to come into your house father God on
[33:53] this New Year's Eve and what a sacred
[33:55] thing Lord when people all over the
[33:57] world Lord are celebrating it the
[33:59] absolute wrong way Lord that your Grace
[34:01] has been allotted to us in our lives
[34:03] Lord to come and to be talking about you
[34:05] Lord and to be thinking about you to
[34:07] partake of that communion Lord and
[34:10] communion of your word and communion of
[34:12] your spirit and Truth father This Time
[34:14] Lord I just pray your blessings upon
[34:16] each everyone Lord I pray that open up
[34:18] our hearts give us what we have need of
[34:20] Father Lord I pray that you just closed
[34:22] my mouth to anything that I shouldn't
[34:24] say Lord and open it to what you'd have
[34:26] me say give us Hearts to receive ears to
[34:28] hear father and lips to speak just what
[34:30] you'd have us to say in Jesus name we
[34:32] love you we commit ourselves into your
[34:34] hands Lord and again want to mention the
[34:36] sick Lord I pray that you meet him meet
[34:38] with them Father the Lord and just
[34:40] restore their body we thank you and we
[34:42] love you and Jesus Christ's name amen
[34:44] amen God bless you you seated tonight
[34:48] this evening
[34:50] by the grace of God
[34:52] I like to speak on the subject spiritual
[34:54] conditions in the sight of God
[34:57] because we can go as humans along in a
[35:02] certain way or in a certain lifestyle or
[35:04] be in a certain condition
[35:07] and think we're all right but what's
[35:09] really important is how does God see us
[35:12] right
[35:13] are we really pleasing him
[35:15] and I like to put emphasis there in
[35:17] Genesis chapter 2 that they were both
[35:20] naked the man and his wife and we're not
[35:24] ashamed right
[35:26] we find that before the fall God had
[35:30] veiled Adam and Eve with a holy ghost
[35:33] Veil right to where they were veiled
[35:35] with his word wherein the natural
[35:38] they were completely naked
[35:40] but before God they were clothed right
[35:43] and in the right condition and then
[35:44] they're right because after he got
[35:46] through with the creation he rested it
[35:48] was perfect and it was complete
[35:50] so before the fall God had them
[35:53] fortified around his word right
[35:56] so then after the fall
[35:59] they were actually
[36:01] clothed with fig leaves
[36:04] but they were naked spiritually
[36:06] so when they were naked in the natural
[36:08] God's work was done it was perfected
[36:11] because they were clothed in his word
[36:14] by a holy ghost Veil right so then after
[36:17] the fall
[36:19] they were clothed literally but naked
[36:21] spiritually right
[36:23] and God seen right through them fig
[36:25] leaves so what we try and do and how
[36:27] because God has ordained for us just as
[36:30] he we now have to have posed naturally
[36:33] we must be clothed spiritually as well
[36:36] God requires
[36:38] clothing
[36:40] amen and we know that the natural types
[36:42] of spiritual right and the spiritual
[36:44] types are natural
[36:45] so he had them veiled and as soon as eve
[36:48] took a line was beguiled by the serpent
[36:51] she became naked
[36:53] and then when Eve out and then when she
[36:55] brought the fruit to Adam and he partook
[36:57] of it they were both naked before God
[37:01] let's look down in Genesis 3.
[37:03] The Familiar broken-hearted story of the
[37:07] Fall here
[37:08] yeah
[37:10] because you can imagine
[37:12] when a child in a natural does something
[37:15] wrong they will break your heart
[37:18] so God and that is just a natural so God
[37:21] as our heavenly father you can imagine
[37:23] when the news got to heaven
[37:25] about his Fallen children what they've
[37:27] done to his heart
[37:29] because Adam and Eve was a perfect
[37:31] Masterpiece of God
[37:33] and Satan came and he martyred that
[37:35] masterpiece
[37:37] now God was not surprised because God is
[37:40] not he's infinite and he knows all
[37:42] things but as a father it still broke
[37:45] his heart
[37:46] that he said everything imperfect there
[37:48] was not a single thing that Adam and Eve
[37:50] did not have
[37:53] right so Satan went to the weaker vessel
[37:56] and he got her to compromise on the word
[37:58] right
[38:00] and brother Ram teaches us that if God
[38:03] knew what that one broken word would
[38:05] cause all of the hurting and the crying
[38:09] babies and the death and the sorrow
[38:11] of these six thousand years but he could
[38:14] not bypass his own word God is subject
[38:17] to his own word
[38:20] so think of how powerful that is that
[38:21] God himself when he speaks a word cannot
[38:24] change it so when the fall happened God
[38:27] had to do exactly what he said the day
[38:30] they ate was the day they died right
[38:32] and not a single person has ever lived
[38:34] to be a thousand years a day since that
[38:36] time
[38:37] so in Genesis 3
[38:39] now the serpent was more subtle than any
[38:42] beast of the field which the Lord God
[38:44] had made and he said unto the woman yea
[38:46] have God said You shall not eat of every
[38:48] tree of the garden
[38:50] and the woman said unto the serpent we
[38:52] may eat of the fruit of the Trees of the
[38:54] garden but of the fruit of the tree
[38:56] which is in the midst of the garden God
[38:58] hath said ye shall not eat of it neither
[39:00] shall you touch it lest ye die and the
[39:03] serpent said unto the woman ye shall not
[39:05] surely die
[39:06] for God doth know that in the day eat
[39:08] thereof then your eye shall be open
[39:11] and he shall be his Gods knowing good
[39:13] and evil and when the woman saw that the
[39:15] tree was good for food and that was
[39:17] pleasant to the eyes and a treat to be
[39:20] desired to make one wise she took the
[39:22] fruit thereof and did eat and gave also
[39:24] unto her husband with her and he did eat
[39:27] in the eyes of both of them and the eyes
[39:29] of them both were open and they knew
[39:32] that they were naked
[39:33] and they sewed fig leaves together and
[39:35] made themselves aprons
[39:37] and we know
[39:39] as brother Ram teaches us that how in
[39:41] the world as a common theological belief
[39:43] would be that an apple made them realize
[39:45] they were naked right
[39:47] that's not possible right because if you
[39:50] think about it God does not change his
[39:51] word right because if eating app there's
[39:55] nothing wrong with eating an apple
[39:57] right
[39:58] most of us here love apples so if it was
[40:01] wrong to eat an apple then why isn't it
[40:04] wrong to eat an apple now
[40:06] right but an adultery caused a fall and
[40:09] it was wrong then and an adultery is
[40:12] wrong now because God's word doesn't
[40:14] change
[40:16] it wasn't wrong for them to eat an apple
[40:18] but for us it's okay
[40:20] it was adulterers wrong then and it's
[40:22] wrong now because it's the same word
[40:25] God does not change he is subject to his
[40:27] own word
[40:28] you know what I heard a brother one time
[40:30] make this comment
[40:32] and it's so good to meditate in but he
[40:35] said the highest form of God is his word
[40:39] and when you think about that and you
[40:42] think of all every Vision every dream
[40:44] every prophecy has to be compared to
[40:46] what the word and
[40:48] so you can so if God comes and he
[40:52] imparts his word to you that is an
[40:54] impartation of God himself right to you
[40:57] when you have a revelation that Jesus
[40:59] Christ died for you when you have
[41:01] revelation of the born-again expansion
[41:02] it is a personally a revelation
[41:05] personally revealed to you as an
[41:06] individual that is a part of God himself
[41:10] as the word comes forth and you receive
[41:12] it you are receiving part of God himself
[41:15] right and that's the highest form there
[41:17] is
[41:19] the highest form of God is his word and
[41:22] his Revelation to you
[41:24] there's nothing greater because God can
[41:27] speak to you through Visions dreams or
[41:29] Revelation right but the other the
[41:32] dreams and the Visions have got to be
[41:33] compared to the word
[41:35] but when he gives you a revelation and
[41:36] it runs through Genesis through
[41:38] Revelations
[41:39] you've got it
[41:42] so we find that Eve Adam and Eve and
[41:45] when they realize they were naked
[41:46] immediately so fig leaves and yet they
[41:48] were naked God could see right through
[41:49] their fig leaves in verse 8
[41:52] and they heard the voice of the Lord God
[41:55] Walking In The Garden in the cool of the
[41:56] day
[41:57] and Adam and his wife hid themselves
[41:59] from the presence of the Lord God
[42:00] amongst the Trees of the garden
[42:03] and the Lord God called unto Adam and
[42:05] said unto him where art thou and he said
[42:07] I heard thy voice in the garden and I
[42:08] was naked and I was afraid because I was
[42:11] naked and I hid myself
[42:14] and he said who told thee that thou was
[42:16] naked
[42:17] hast thou eating of the tree which I
[42:19] come in as thou that thou shouldest not
[42:21] eat and the woman and the man said the
[42:24] woman whom thou gave us to me to be with
[42:26] me she gave
[42:28] me of the tree I did eat and the Lord
[42:30] God said unto woman what is this the
[42:32] thou has done and the woman said the
[42:33] serpent beguiled me and I did eat so he
[42:35] kept going on down
[42:37] so even though Adam and Eve sowed fig
[42:40] leaves for themselves they themselves
[42:42] are still ashamed right and I don't
[42:44] think that there's
[42:45] a person because we know that religion
[42:47] there's a difference between true
[42:49] Christianity and religion
[42:52] I don't my you know as personally I
[42:54] don't like being called religious
[42:56] because Satan is religious
[42:58] Satan is not a Christian because
[43:01] Christian is to be christ-like religious
[43:04] is to adhere to religious principles or
[43:07] or Creeds or rules bye
[43:10] Satan cannot be a Christian but he's
[43:11] very religious
[43:13] and so are his children
[43:15] and that can knock the socks off the
[43:17] carnal mind of the ways of thinking
[43:19] because people think they can join
[43:21] church and be all right but when they
[43:24] join church and that's where they stay
[43:25] Satan's guide them it's fig leaves
[43:29] religion is fig leaves they cover
[43:31] themselves and think they're covered
[43:33] they feel good about it but they're
[43:35] still naked and God can see it
[43:38] they are still naked
[43:41] whether they know it or they don't
[43:44] they're still naked Adam and Eve knew it
[43:46] they so figgly they try to cover but
[43:48] when God came they said
[43:49] we were naked we ran we had we were
[43:52] afraid because we knew we were naked and
[43:56] then God knew exactly what had happened
[43:59] brother random
[44:04] in the summer and Satan's Eden
[44:07] he said she was naked and eaten
[44:10] see the two kingdoms alike one is of sin
[44:12] and death and the other is life and
[44:15] righteousness in there she was veiled
[44:17] with the Holy Veil they were both naked
[44:20] they didn't know it they didn't know
[44:22] nothing about it because they were
[44:23] veiled with God's spirit
[44:26] and here
[44:27] this is after the fall they are veiled
[44:29] with lust and they look to one another
[44:32] see to see Adam could look at Eve and
[44:35] she didn't know she was naked but now
[44:37] with this lust fell she doesn't realize
[44:40] that she's naked right
[44:42] right but she does it under this lust
[44:44] Veil to make a man look at her it's the
[44:47] only thing she can do it for
[44:50] you so now
[44:52] she's under a lust fail
[44:54] and when she exposes herself it is only
[44:58] to make a man look right
[45:01] right so the Holy Ghost and a man will
[45:04] make him turn his head
[45:07] right because without what did Brother
[45:09] Graham say about a healthy red blood
[45:11] amount
[45:12] it is not possible Right it takes the
[45:15] Holy Ghost and our brother to make him
[45:18] turn his head
[45:19] but they do it because they're under the
[45:22] lust Bell right
[45:24] right they're not under innocence
[45:25] anymore
[45:26] because when they were under innocence
[45:28] God had it was the Holy Ghost Veil
[45:31] and that was just the lustful flesh pot
[45:34] you know and it never made sense to me
[45:37] hello early guy could just let his
[45:40] girlfriend just be exposed and walk
[45:42] around like it's a matter of Pride yeah
[45:44] you know it's like the poor guy don't
[45:46] realize that if
[45:48] she dressed in that way attracted you
[45:50] she's gonna attract everybody else but
[45:52] it it's like they can't even think right
[45:55] they think that I want to show off what
[45:57] I have
[45:58] it's like when a man or a woman leaves
[46:00] their spouse or someone else they think
[46:02] they've got it they're only going to
[46:04] leave you too right if they've done it
[46:06] once they're going to do it again
[46:11] because that's the world we're living in
[46:13] and if an outward expression
[46:16] of what's on the inside right what did
[46:19] Brotherhood say watch who you marry if
[46:21] you want to see what's inside a person
[46:23] watch what they marry exactly because
[46:25] that's what they're attracted to if a
[46:27] man marries a streetwalker that's what's
[46:29] in them
[46:30] if he marries a Christian lady that's
[46:32] what's in him
[46:35] because out of the abundance of the
[46:36] heart the mouth speak of
[46:39] and you watch what they do not what they
[46:42] say right how's it saying you know your
[46:46] life speaks so loud I can't hear what
[46:48] you say
[46:51] how we live our lives to this word is
[46:53] what really expresses how we if we
[46:55] believe this word
[46:59] just like you know Don't Preach a sermon
[47:02] live it
[47:04] we all preach sermons with our lives
[47:08] and God does not hate The Sinner he
[47:11] hates the sin right exactly he hates the
[47:14] unbelief because remember ours our walk
[47:18] is like a chain right over hell
[47:21] and one word is all it takes the chain
[47:24] is only strongest at his weakest link
[47:26] and you hear that all the time but think
[47:28] about it
[47:29] no matter how strong that chain is and
[47:32] how much weight if it's got one weak
[47:35] link the rest of the links don't mean a
[47:36] single thing
[47:38] and where you leave God and where you
[47:40] leave his word that is where Satan has a
[47:43] perfect right to enter in your life
[47:44] right
[47:46] because that is where Eve left the word
[47:49] where Eve left the word where she let
[47:51] down the word Satan walked right in and
[47:53] beguiled her
[47:55] and then cause her husband to do the
[47:57] same thing right
[47:59] and calls to fall
[48:02] in the sermon influence brother Branham
[48:04] says
[48:06] it's only for believers he said he that
[48:09] believeth all things are possible not
[48:10] him that don't believeth and one Speck
[48:14] of unbelief against the word of God and
[48:16] you'll stay out of the Kingdom of Heaven
[48:20] it took Eve out it caused all this
[48:22] trouble once just to pervert the word
[48:24] just a little bit you've got to say
[48:27] straight with it what it says
[48:31] one Speck of unbelief against the word
[48:34] of God and you'll stay out of the
[48:36] kingdom of heaven right
[48:40] and we as a people as a generation
[48:43] have the no excuse when God is coming
[48:47] he's manifested his word
[48:49] he's common there's not no reason for
[48:51] anyone to disbelieve
[48:55] one Speck of unbelief
[48:58] because Satan got to the woman the
[49:00] weaker vessel right and worked on her
[49:03] reasoning and worked on on her mental
[49:06] faculties
[49:09] we've got to stand on the word because
[49:12] if we don't stand on the word if we
[49:14] don't stand on all the word then we're
[49:15] not standing on nothing right
[49:18] because heaven and earth will pass away
[49:20] but my word shall never pass away
[49:24] one Speck
[49:27] when God Reveals His word to you when he
[49:29] speaks to you he expects us to walk
[49:31] right in that word
[49:34] because that is a trait that is a sign
[49:36] of a child of God is when they receive
[49:38] correction
[49:40] receiving correction is a sign of being
[49:43] a child what does the Bible say Bible
[49:45] language that if we can't receive
[49:47] correction we're as bastards right right
[49:49] illegitimate that's what the word says
[49:51] we've got to be able to receive
[49:53] correction
[49:55] correction is a good thing love is
[49:58] correction
[50:02] and why I'm against organized religion
[50:05] Adam was sure that if he covered his
[50:07] nakedness God couldn't see it you can't
[50:10] cover it God has to cover it exactly
[50:12] right
[50:13] see see God's program covers it not
[50:15] yours it's always been that way they
[50:17] fail to see Jesus in his Temple God
[50:20] manifested In the Flesh people try and
[50:23] clothe their own
[50:25] spiritual nakedness with good works and
[50:28] it's fig leaves
[50:30] you it takes God's program to cover us
[50:35] we cannot cover it ourselves no matter
[50:38] how good we are how much we donate to
[50:40] feed the poor what we do it takes God's
[50:43] program to cover us so what is his
[50:46] covering his covering in the beginning
[50:47] was his word and if he can't change and
[50:50] this is his covering now
[50:52] this is the word this is the blood
[50:56] this is Mercy this is everything
[51:01] and remember brother Graham said as God
[51:04] as long as it's in the letter people can
[51:06] doubt it sure come on but when it's
[51:09] revealed and manifested events about it
[51:12] it's sin what did Jesus say he said had
[51:15] I not come you had not had sinned
[51:18] but now that I've come you've hated both
[51:20] me and my father
[51:22] because he came to manifest what was
[51:24] written of him right
[51:26] manifestation of the word and when if
[51:28] it's manifested and the people see it
[51:30] before them then they walk away from it
[51:32] there's no more Mercy right
[51:34] to see it clearly and understand how
[51:37] many ministers did Brother Branham will
[51:39] approach the prophet and said we know we
[51:42] know you're right we know this is thus
[51:44] saith the Lord but we can't do it we're
[51:45] going to be kicked out
[51:48] they're going to lose their paycheck
[51:50] so they purposely backed away from the
[51:52] word when they knew what they were what
[51:55] they did it was a conscious thing
[51:57] someone can walk
[52:00] in ignorance and not understand that's
[52:02] one thing and then God can have mercy on
[52:05] them and it hit them that's what happens
[52:07] with people especially even raising the
[52:09] message
[52:09] they hear it their whole lives and
[52:12] they're brought up but then one time
[52:13] it's personal to them
[52:15] and that's what makes a difference
[52:17] because remember God doesn't have
[52:19] grandchildren he doesn't have message
[52:21] grandchildren either
[52:23] it's a personal experience a burning
[52:26] bush Sans experience because brother Ram
[52:29] said that when Satan then when he comes
[52:31] to you because he will he has he is and
[52:34] he will
[52:35] he says you take them back to that spot
[52:38] right you take them down to that top
[52:40] post
[52:42] well you met him personally
[52:44] not where
[52:46] you're saying it because
[52:48] brother Dale is saying it right right
[52:50] because the brothers are saying the
[52:52] minute because your mommy and daddy
[52:53] exactly right but when you meet him face
[52:55] to face that's something Satan can never
[52:57] take away from you
[53:00] up until then it's just intellectual
[53:04] you're believing unto
[53:07] but Satan cannot root that out once
[53:09] you've met him how can he you are there
[53:14] how can he say you weren't there when
[53:16] you were there right
[53:17] right how can he say you didn't meet
[53:19] Jesus when you met him
[53:21] it's not possible
[53:25] so it takes the blood of God to clothe
[53:27] our soul
[53:28] we can't do nothing to save ourselves
[53:32] not a single thing
[53:34] so the sad part is is when people
[53:38] are that way and they don't realize it
[53:40] right
[53:41] let's go to Revelations chapter three
[54:00] very familiar text
[54:03] verse 14.
[54:07] because how many know we're living in a
[54:09] lady of sin Church age
[54:12] now the bride
[54:13] we're living in that time frame but the
[54:16] bride is called out a lady to say Amen
[54:18] spiritually but Lady of SIA is around us
[54:20] and Lady osia is there to influence us
[54:23] if we're not careful exactly and
[54:26] remember lady osia is is lukewarm and
[54:29] how do you you know you can kill a frog
[54:31] by boiling it by just gradually turn up
[54:33] the water and they don't even know it
[54:34] right
[54:35] Lady of C is a lukewarm spirit that
[54:38] gradually takes people because remember
[54:40] backsliding don't even happen in an
[54:42] instant it's gradual slide it's not a
[54:45] back drop off
[54:46] your backslide right amen
[54:51] you slide
[54:55] okay verse 14 and unto the angel of the
[54:59] Church of the lady of sins right these
[55:01] things saith thee amen the faithful and
[55:03] true witness the beginning of the
[55:04] creation of God
[55:06] I Know Thy works that thou art neither
[55:09] cold nor hot I would I weren't cold or
[55:11] hot so then because Thou Art lukewarm
[55:13] and neither cold nor hot I will spew the
[55:15] out of my mouth because thou sayest now
[55:18] he's not saying they said because thou
[55:20] sayest I am rich and increase with goods
[55:22] and have need of nothing and know us not
[55:25] that thou art wretched and miserable and
[55:28] poor and blind and naked
[55:31] I counsel thee to buy me gold trout in
[55:35] the fire that Godly character amen amen
[55:38] that thou mayest be rich and what white
[55:41] arraignment that thou mayest be clothed
[55:45] the latest in condition is to be
[55:47] miserable blind and naked so he said I'm
[55:50] counselor of thee to Bob me
[55:53] and white raiment that thou mayest be
[55:55] clothed and if thou shame of thy
[55:57] nakedness do not appear and anoint thy
[56:00] eyes with I said that thou mayest see
[56:03] and as many as I love I rebuke and
[56:05] chasten be zealous therefore
[56:07] and repent
[56:09] so he sees the condition of the church
[56:11] age and he's saying come by
[56:14] come unto me all ye that are
[56:16] heavy laden labor and are heavy laid and
[56:18] I will give you rest
[56:21] come unto me and I'll give you white
[56:22] arraignment that you're that your
[56:24] nakedness do not appear because if your
[56:26] neck and disappear you're naked before
[56:28] God
[56:30] and he requires clothing
[56:33] he requires a covering for sin right
[56:36] what did he do when he when he rebuked
[56:39] the Fig leaves he killed the lamb and he
[56:41] clothed them himself
[56:43] for a temporary foreshadowed atonement
[56:46] of clothes until the real clothing the
[56:49] Lord Jesus Christ will come
[56:51] right and he was crucified naked his
[56:54] shame
[56:56] he bore our shame so that we can be
[56:59] clothed he was naked in the sight of man
[57:01] that we may be clothed in the sight of
[57:03] God
[57:05] he took that upon us and upon himself
[57:08] for us rather
[57:10] in the presence of God and recognized
[57:14] he said just think if a man or a woman
[57:17] was on the street wretched blind poor
[57:19] miserable naked and you could tell them
[57:21] that they were naked and they would
[57:22] listen to you but what if they are naked
[57:25] and they don't believe it what a mental
[57:27] condition that is right
[57:30] right well now
[57:31] that's what kind of a spiritual
[57:33] condition it is
[57:35] people are spiritually blind
[57:39] wretched miserable naked before God
[57:46] Sinners trying to cover themselves
[57:49] behind fig leaves of some denomination
[57:51] and don't know it
[57:54] they're naked before God
[57:59] and remember
[58:00] God pronounced his judgment upon
[58:02] nakedness and then he clothed him
[58:05] a substitution until the real clothing
[58:08] will come
[58:10] naked before God right
[58:14] right because we come into the world as
[58:16] Sinners and naked before God
[58:18] just like we're born naked physically
[58:20] we're born naked spiritually right and
[58:22] can't do nothing to save ourselves
[58:25] so what does the first thing happen
[58:26] after the baby's born they cover it and
[58:28] it's always clothed for the most part
[58:30] right
[58:32] until
[58:33] they get older and then they don't know
[58:35] the Lord they take it back off yeah but
[58:37] God's intention is for it to stay on and
[58:40] then just as when a baby's born
[58:42] is closed when a baby is born in the
[58:45] Lord The born-again Experience they're
[58:48] clothed right
[58:50] they're clothed before God
[58:55] let's go to Judges chapter 16.
[58:59] remember this lady was sin's spirit
[59:02] is very sneaky
[59:06] is very gradual
[59:12] and that's something that we just need
[59:14] to pray the Lord will help us keep our
[59:16] guard on right
[59:18] because in this day where the you know
[59:20] the day of conveniences and all the the
[59:22] modern living and things that we have
[59:25] we've got to be careful
[59:29] we find here that Samson
[59:31] was a man of God as so long he God could
[59:34] only use what Samson would yield to him
[59:36] right he yielded his strength but not
[59:38] his heart God used his strength but
[59:39] couldn't use his heart right because he
[59:41] gave that to Delilah right
[59:45] let's go to
[59:46] verse 16.
[59:49] he fell in love with Delilah we all know
[59:51] the background
[59:53] and it came to pass Delilah was trying
[59:56] to find his secret right where his
[59:59] strength lied
[1:00:01] and he wouldn't tell her
[1:00:02] he kept
[1:00:04] leading her around in verse 16 and it
[1:00:07] came to pass when she pressed him daily
[1:00:08] with her words and urged him so that his
[1:00:11] soul was vexed and to death that he told
[1:00:14] her all his heart and said unto her
[1:00:16] there hath not come a razor upon my head
[1:00:18] for I have been a Nazarite unto God for
[1:00:20] my mother's room
[1:00:22] if I be shaving then my strength will go
[1:00:24] from me and I shall become weak and be
[1:00:26] like any other man and when Delilah saw
[1:00:29] that he had told her all his heart she
[1:00:31] went and called the Lords of the
[1:00:33] Philistines saying come up at once this
[1:00:34] once for he had showed me all his heart
[1:00:37] then the Lords of the Philistines came
[1:00:39] up unto her and brought money in her
[1:00:41] hand
[1:00:42] and she made him sleep upon her knees
[1:00:47] and she called for a man and caused him
[1:00:51] to shave off the Seven Locks off his
[1:00:53] head
[1:00:54] and she began to afflict him and his
[1:00:57] strength went from him right
[1:00:59] so Delilah can be a type of the world
[1:01:03] a type of religion
[1:01:07] to where she put Samson to sleep on her
[1:01:10] knees
[1:01:12] she lulled him to sleep she sunk to him
[1:01:15] she played with his hair his locks
[1:01:18] and he fell asleep in the lap of Delilah
[1:01:21] he gave up her secret and the secret of
[1:01:24] the Bride is the revelation of the word
[1:01:26] and as soon as you compromise on that
[1:01:28] you've given Satan your secret right
[1:01:31] low to sleep right in the lap of Delilah
[1:01:35] Rock-a-bye Baby right
[1:01:39] and she said the Philistines be upon
[1:01:42] these Samson and he awoke out of his
[1:01:44] sleep and said I will go out as the
[1:01:46] other times before and shake myself
[1:01:49] and he wits not that the Lord was
[1:01:51] departed from him
[1:01:54] before when he was leading her around he
[1:01:56] would lie to her and tell her these
[1:01:58] things and when she would say the
[1:01:59] Philistines to be upon the Samson it's
[1:02:00] no problem I've got a good church I've
[1:02:02] got some people to pray through with me
[1:02:04] I'll be fine
[1:02:06] but one time he got low to sleep
[1:02:10] gradually by Lady Lucia he got put to
[1:02:12] sleep
[1:02:14] and when when the voice came behold the
[1:02:16] Philistines be upon these Samson or
[1:02:19] behold the bridegroom cometh
[1:02:22] Samson thought okay I'm gonna shake
[1:02:24] myself as before and I'm gonna go out
[1:02:26] I'm gonna go out to meet the bridegroom
[1:02:27] because I was raising a message church
[1:02:29] I'll go out to me to meet the bridegroom
[1:02:32] because I've been a good believer
[1:02:35] and they don't realize the spirit of the
[1:02:37] Lord departed from them
[1:02:38] and they're finding themselves in the
[1:02:40] tribulation period
[1:02:42] because there were low to sleep by Lady
[1:02:44] Lucia by that evil spirit of Lady osia
[1:02:47] the evil spirit of comfort the evil
[1:02:50] spirit of of everything going so easy
[1:02:54] because when trouble strikes that
[1:02:56] naturally makes us call on the Lord
[1:02:59] so in this age that we live in
[1:03:02] we've got to be really careful and not
[1:03:03] get lukewarm
[1:03:05] we've got to stay fervent hot on the
[1:03:07] word right and not be in the lap of
[1:03:09] Delilah
[1:03:12] and think that well that's fine because
[1:03:13] as soon as we we I really feel like the
[1:03:16] Lord's about to come I'm gonna get born
[1:03:18] again then I'm gonna get serious with
[1:03:20] the Lord then oh yeah it's going to be
[1:03:23] too late
[1:03:24] because remember the foolish virgins
[1:03:28] they know enough about the message to
[1:03:30] refuse to Mark is that right
[1:03:32] they know to refuse the mark
[1:03:36] so they have that head knowledge of the
[1:03:37] message but they don't have the
[1:03:39] revelation of the message they don't
[1:03:40] have the new birth in them to go out to
[1:03:43] meet him because brother Brown said at
[1:03:45] the bridegroom call
[1:03:46] is going to come right through this the
[1:03:48] message the bridegroom is called
[1:03:52] so when you hear the bridegroom call
[1:03:55] then you go out to meet them right
[1:03:58] but if someone is in the lap of Delilah
[1:04:00] they can't go out to meet them right
[1:04:01] because he's low to sleep and while he's
[1:04:05] low to sleep he gets his lock shaved off
[1:04:08] yeah everything he thought he had all
[1:04:10] the strength he thought he had
[1:04:13] taken right from him right and as soon
[1:04:15] as she said the fellow seems to be upon
[1:04:17] these Samson
[1:04:18] the coming of the Lord is upon that he
[1:04:20] said I'll I'll rise up I'll shake myself
[1:04:23] I'll be able to do it last minute
[1:04:26] look when we see the resurrected Saints
[1:04:29] it's going to be over
[1:04:31] is not going to be we see the
[1:04:33] resurrected Saints and we're going to
[1:04:34] repent so we can go with him at that
[1:04:35] time the mercy will be over
[1:04:40] the time of Deliverance is now
[1:04:42] now is the time that we must clothe
[1:04:45] ourselves with the word now is the time
[1:04:48] that we must put on our garments
[1:04:50] and if put on our garments is that it no
[1:04:52] we've got to keep him spotless
[1:04:55] are you washed in the blood of the Lamb
[1:04:57] we come to church we get our garments
[1:05:00] cleaned we get our garments washed
[1:05:03] in the bleach of God
[1:05:07] but the Philistines took him and put out
[1:05:10] his eyes that's what Lady of SIA does
[1:05:13] Lady of SIA will put out your eyes and
[1:05:16] you can't see what God is doing anymore
[1:05:18] because you're too blinded by the things
[1:05:19] of the world
[1:05:23] and but the Philistines took him and put
[1:05:25] out his eyes and brought him down to
[1:05:26] Gaza
[1:05:27] and bound him with Fetters of brass
[1:05:30] and he did grind in the prison house
[1:05:33] that's exactly what the devil would do
[1:05:35] to you
[1:05:36] put your eyes out later see ya take you
[1:05:39] to work in his grinding house
[1:05:44] because Samson exposes secrets to
[1:05:47] Delilah
[1:05:48] where has thou thou thou strength gone
[1:05:51] Samson
[1:05:53] because you know brother Ryan preached
[1:05:55] to Simon just once more Lord he typed
[1:05:57] Samson with lady osia right
[1:06:02] and that's later seeing condition
[1:06:07] where has thou strength gone Samson
[1:06:11] and he wits not
[1:06:13] that the Lord was departed from him
[1:06:16] he didn't realize until it was too late
[1:06:20] he found himself in that lady of sin
[1:06:22] condition
[1:06:25] in the lap of Delilah
[1:06:30] in this world
[1:06:33] is a nasty place this world is not my
[1:06:36] home amen
[1:06:39] you know brother Brandon
[1:06:43] said that this world looks like a urinal
[1:06:45] to God it's the nasty wiped out place
[1:06:47] but it's only for the bride of Christ
[1:06:48] it's only because of you right
[1:06:51] he sees a beautiful Jewel
[1:06:53] Ry we're going to get to it later where
[1:06:55] he says that you are like a lily among
[1:06:57] thorns
[1:07:00] you're his beloved
[1:07:03] you're his chosen lady
[1:07:05] so he's old enough until the last one
[1:07:08] comes in when the last one comes in it's
[1:07:10] already ripe for judgment
[1:07:12] so we know that the woman types the
[1:07:15] church both here is Delilah and all
[1:07:17] through the Bible a woman types the
[1:07:19] church
[1:07:20] and there are certain characteristics
[1:07:24] that the Bible gives that completely
[1:07:26] portray an entire age or an entire group
[1:07:29] of people
[1:07:31] when he says Harlot we know exactly what
[1:07:33] that means
[1:07:34] when he says a virgin we know exactly
[1:07:37] what that means he uses the
[1:07:38] characteristic of a virgin to portray a
[1:07:42] church
[1:07:44] and he uses the characteristic of our
[1:07:47] work to do the same thing
[1:07:49] they're both women
[1:07:51] remember both the Virgin and a are
[1:07:54] both women right
[1:07:55] what matters what differentiates the two
[1:07:57] is how loyal their loyalty to their
[1:08:00] husband right
[1:08:03] that is the only difference
[1:08:05] how true are they to the word of their
[1:08:06] husband
[1:08:07] how true are they to the wedding vows of
[1:08:10] the husband
[1:08:14] so we know that Israel types the church
[1:08:17] we know that we again know that the
[1:08:19] natural types of spiritual
[1:08:22] and we see that what Israel done the
[1:08:25] Gentiles went through the same thing
[1:08:27] they had their own version of the church
[1:08:28] ages
[1:08:30] right just like us
[1:08:31] and we know during the Dark Age their
[1:08:33] Dark Age Ahab and Jezebel got married
[1:08:35] just like the church in the state the
[1:08:37] same thing
[1:08:39] let's go to Ezekiel chapter 16.
[1:08:54] this is kind of a lengthy read but I
[1:08:56] want to just I'll just kind of try and
[1:08:58] read fast because I
[1:09:01] you can read the whole chapter
[1:09:03] sometime at home we'll read part of it
[1:09:06] there
[1:09:08] just keep in mind this is God talking to
[1:09:11] Israel
[1:09:12] in Ezekiel 16.
[1:09:15] verse 6.
[1:09:20] and when I passed by thee and saw the
[1:09:22] polluted and thy known blood I said unto
[1:09:25] thee well now what's in my blood live
[1:09:28] yea I said unto thee when I was sin thy
[1:09:30] blood lived
[1:09:31] I have caused thee to multiply as the
[1:09:33] butt of the field and now it's increased
[1:09:35] in waxing great and now it come to
[1:09:37] excellent ornaments they breast are
[1:09:39] fashioned and here is grown whereas thou
[1:09:41] what snake it and bare now when I passed
[1:09:43] by thee and looked upon thee and behold
[1:09:45] thy time was a time of love I spread my
[1:09:48] skirt over thee and covered thy
[1:09:50] nakedness he's telling Israel this he
[1:09:52] found her naked in her own blood and
[1:09:54] this is what he did for her
[1:09:57] yea I swear unto thee and entered into a
[1:10:00] covenant with thee saith the Lord God
[1:10:02] and thou becameth mine isn't that sweet
[1:10:06] then washed out thee with water yay I
[1:10:08] thoroughly washed away thy blood from
[1:10:10] thee and I anointed thee with oil
[1:10:13] I clothe thee also with embroidered work
[1:10:16] and shoddy with Badger skins and I
[1:10:18] girded Thee about with fine linen and I
[1:10:20] covered thee with silk I thee
[1:10:22] also with ornaments and I put bracelets
[1:10:24] upon my hands in a chain on my neck and
[1:10:27] I put a jewel on my forehead and
[1:10:29] earrings in my ears and what a beautiful
[1:10:30] crown upon and a beautiful crown upon my
[1:10:33] head thus that was thou decked with gold
[1:10:36] and silver and the arraignment was a
[1:10:38] fine linen and silk embroidered work
[1:10:40] thou just eat fine flour and honey and
[1:10:42] oil and that was exceeding beautiful and
[1:10:45] now just Prosper into a kingdom this is
[1:10:47] all what he done for her right and I
[1:10:50] renowned went forth among the Heathen
[1:10:52] for thy Beauty for it was perfect
[1:10:54] through my comeliness
[1:10:56] which I had put I had put upon thee
[1:10:59] saith the Lord God
[1:11:01] but now look what happens but
[1:11:04] thou ditch trust the thine own Beauty
[1:11:06] right and plate us to harlot uh oh
[1:11:10] before he closed her and she was
[1:11:12] beautiful put a a chain around her neck
[1:11:15] and bracelets and ornaments and
[1:11:16] embroidered work she was a thing of
[1:11:18] beauty
[1:11:19] but she started to trust in that beauty
[1:11:21] right not trust on the one who gave it
[1:11:23] to her
[1:11:24] right and plate is the Harlot of thine
[1:11:27] renowned a renowned importance that like
[1:11:29] fornications on everyone that passed by
[1:11:31] his it was
[1:11:33] innovate garments they'll just take and
[1:11:35] decades thy high places with diverse
[1:11:37] colors and played us to harlot thereupon
[1:11:39] the light things shall not come neither
[1:11:41] shall it be so thou has taken thy Fair
[1:11:43] jewels of my gold that of my silver
[1:11:44] which I have given thee and made us to
[1:11:46] thyself as images of man and just commit
[1:11:49] whoredom with them and took us the
[1:11:51] embroidered garments and covers them and
[1:11:53] thou had set mine oil on my instance
[1:11:54] before them my meat also which I gave
[1:11:57] thee fine flower and oil and honey
[1:11:59] wherewith I fed thee thou Hast even said
[1:12:01] it before them for a sweet Savor thus it
[1:12:04] was saith the Lord he gave all that for
[1:12:06] them
[1:12:07] and they to turn around with the gold he
[1:12:09] gives them he makes him images
[1:12:13] right he takes the Blessed they took the
[1:12:15] blessing of God and turned it to a curse
[1:12:17] a snare to their own selves
[1:12:22] God can bless you with things
[1:12:25] and you turn around and turn it to a
[1:12:27] curse to your own self
[1:12:30] whether it's Financial blessing whether
[1:12:33] it's
[1:12:34] good looks whatever it may be right
[1:12:37] because remember he said that's the
[1:12:38] greatest snare to a woman
[1:12:44] Satan perverts it takes it and turns it
[1:12:47] around so God can bless you with
[1:12:48] something he can bless you with a
[1:12:50] wonderful family
[1:12:52] and then you fall asleep in the life of
[1:12:54] Delilah and you ruin it right
[1:12:56] he blessed you he gave it to you sure
[1:12:59] and he turned around and you mess it up
[1:13:04] but there's Grace
[1:13:07] thank God for Amazing Grace
[1:13:10] because it was if it wasn't for his
[1:13:12] grace there'd be none of us here right
[1:13:15] most certainly he wouldn't be me here
[1:13:17] amen
[1:13:19] verse 16 of
[1:13:21] we got down to verse 20. moreover thou
[1:13:23] has taken thy sons and thy daughters
[1:13:25] whom thou has born unto me and that I
[1:13:28] sacrificed them unto them to be devoured
[1:13:31] in this or thy whoredoms is small is
[1:13:33] this of thy whoredoms a small matter
[1:13:34] Thou Art slain
[1:13:36] that thou has slain my children and
[1:13:38] delivered them to cause them to pass
[1:13:40] through the fire for them children
[1:13:42] sacrifices it should have been raised up
[1:13:44] in honor of Jehovah and they sacrificed
[1:13:46] them to a false god
[1:13:48] and in all that Abominations and I
[1:13:50] whoredoms thou Hast not remembered the
[1:13:52] days that I used when thou was naked and
[1:13:54] bare and was polluted in thy blood and
[1:13:57] it came to pass after all thy wickedness
[1:13:59] woe woe unto thee saith the Lord God
[1:14:02] the thou is also built into the
[1:14:03] inanimate place and has made thee in
[1:14:06] high place in every street
[1:14:08] and he goes down and he keeps bringing
[1:14:11] about that characteristic of an
[1:14:13] ill-fained woman right right because she
[1:14:15] was she cleaned her up
[1:14:18] and then she spoiled herself spoiled her
[1:14:20] skirts
[1:14:24] let's drop down to verse 30.
[1:14:29] how weak his thine heart saith the Lord
[1:14:31] God sing it thou doest all these things
[1:14:33] the work of an imperious woman
[1:14:36] and that thou buildest an enemy an
[1:14:38] intimate place in the head of every way
[1:14:39] and make us that high place in every
[1:14:41] street that thou hath hath not enhanced
[1:14:45] not been as in Harlot and that thou
[1:14:47] scorn us higher but as a wife that
[1:14:49] committeth adultery which taketh
[1:14:51] strangers instead of her husband
[1:14:54] they committed all this spiritual
[1:14:55] adultery against God
[1:14:59] they give gifts to all the but
[1:15:02] they but thou give us thy gifts to all
[1:15:04] thy lovers and hires them that they may
[1:15:05] come unto thee on every side for thy
[1:15:07] whoredom now this is flat language
[1:15:11] but God doesn't beat about the bush
[1:15:15] and he's laying it out and he's saying
[1:15:17] this is how you've treated me this is
[1:15:19] what I've done for you and this instead
[1:15:21] is how you treated me right
[1:15:27] in verse 35 wherefore o Harlot hear the
[1:15:30] word of the Lord
[1:15:31] thus saith the Lord God because thy
[1:15:33] filthiness was poured out and thy
[1:15:35] nakedness discovered through thy
[1:15:37] whoredoms with thy lovers and with all
[1:15:39] the idols of thy lovers with all the
[1:15:41] idols of thy Abominations and by the
[1:15:43] blood of thy children which thou just
[1:15:45] cast
[1:15:46] which thou didst give unto them
[1:15:49] behold therefore
[1:15:51] I will gather all thy lovers with whom
[1:15:53] thou has taken pleasure and all them
[1:15:55] that thou has loved with all them that
[1:15:58] thou has hated and I will get even
[1:15:59] gather them round about against thee and
[1:16:02] will discover thy nakedness unto them
[1:16:04] that they may see all thy nakedness
[1:16:06] right
[1:16:08] and I will judge thee as a woman that
[1:16:10] break wedlock and shed blood or judged
[1:16:13] and I will give thee blood and fury and
[1:16:15] jealousy right
[1:16:16] and I will also give unto thee I will
[1:16:19] also give thee into their hand and they
[1:16:21] shall throw down that intimate place and
[1:16:23] they break down by high places they
[1:16:25] shall strip thee also of thy clothes and
[1:16:27] shall take thy Fair jewels and leave
[1:16:30] thee naked and Bear
[1:16:35] so compare the beginning of that chapter
[1:16:38] to the end of the chapter right
[1:16:41] God raised him up and he gave them
[1:16:43] everything they have need of but it
[1:16:45] wasn't enough
[1:16:46] so then they became naked in the sight
[1:16:48] of God they were clothed
[1:16:50] and God said y'all are beautiful
[1:16:53] I gave you this I gave you a crown I
[1:16:56] gave you jewels
[1:16:58] and then she's naked and bare right
[1:17:00] right
[1:17:02] and when they rejected Jesus they had no
[1:17:05] more clothes for their sin right they
[1:17:07] were again naked in the sight of God
[1:17:09] right
[1:17:11] God requires clothing
[1:17:15] and a person now keep in mind a person
[1:17:18] can be clothed appropriately on the
[1:17:21] outside but still be naked before God on
[1:17:23] the inside they can play the part but be
[1:17:26] naked on the inside right but if a
[1:17:28] person is clothed on the inside it is
[1:17:30] impossible not to be closed on the
[1:17:32] outside man
[1:17:34] because and only God can see that right
[1:17:37] eventually it'll manifest in people's
[1:17:39] life
[1:17:40] but only God can see that right
[1:17:44] we must be clothed in the sight of God
[1:17:46] because if not we're right for judgment
[1:17:54] in job 29 14.
[1:17:57] job said I put on righteousness right
[1:18:00] right and it clothed me
[1:18:02] my judgment was as a robe and a diadem
[1:18:06] he said I put on righteousness and it
[1:18:08] clothed me
[1:18:10] remember when brother ran went to Africa
[1:18:11] and he preached all them heathens and he
[1:18:14] said that they were as naked as the day
[1:18:16] they came into the world
[1:18:17] what was the first thing they did when
[1:18:19] they received Christ
[1:18:20] they cover themselves up right
[1:18:23] and brother Branham said that the Holy
[1:18:25] Spirit
[1:18:27] brings a conscience of nakedness right
[1:18:31] it brings a conscience of nakedness you
[1:18:34] receive Christ on the inside and all
[1:18:37] else will be added unto you
[1:18:38] because the Holy Ghost is the inside
[1:18:40] teacher
[1:18:41] you know and if people are constantly
[1:18:44] trying to search the message to find out
[1:18:46] just how high their skirts can go
[1:18:48] what's the limit right
[1:18:51] well if a person has the Holy Ghost on
[1:18:53] the inside the Holy Ghost will sit to
[1:18:55] limit right I mean you don't see how
[1:18:58] close you can get to the edge you see
[1:19:00] how far away you can stay away from it
[1:19:03] right because there's things in life
[1:19:05] that we may face that we may not
[1:19:06] necessarily find a quote for
[1:19:08] because brother branham's true
[1:19:11] commission was to get abroad ready for
[1:19:12] the Rapture so he dealt with you know
[1:19:15] setting the church in order and and how
[1:19:17] they should dress and not cut their hair
[1:19:19] on things but there's things that you
[1:19:21] may come across that it really takes the
[1:19:23] Holy Ghost to set your boundaries
[1:19:25] it takes the inside teachers say well
[1:19:27] that's not quite right
[1:19:30] you know it's not it's not I probably
[1:19:32] really shouldn't go out you know if a
[1:19:34] girl wears a uh a skirt that is you know
[1:19:38] she can show you the quote brother
[1:19:39] random said as long as it covers a knee
[1:19:42] but if her heart is wrong then she's
[1:19:43] wrong
[1:19:45] you know it's it's the heart it's what's
[1:19:48] in the heart
[1:19:51] and that's where the Holy Ghost has got
[1:19:53] to lead us
[1:19:55] is it right or is it wrong you know the
[1:19:58] Holy Ghost is an inside teacher
[1:20:01] and that's what we
[1:20:03] trust him for
[1:20:07] he put us there he put that Holy Ghost
[1:20:09] there for an inside teacher
[1:20:13] Isaiah 61 10 says I will greatly rejoice
[1:20:16] in the Lord my soul shall be joyful in
[1:20:18] my God for he hath clothed me with the
[1:20:21] garments of Salvation he hath covered me
[1:20:24] with the robe of righteousness
[1:20:26] remember Lady of SIA he said come by
[1:20:29] Raymond of me that you're going to be
[1:20:30] clothed so that your nakedness do not
[1:20:32] appear right
[1:20:34] right it's the righteousness of God that
[1:20:36] covers you
[1:20:38] because we're in the righteousness
[1:20:40] our righteousness what does the Bible
[1:20:42] say is this filthy rags before
[1:20:44] our righteousness is as fig leaves
[1:20:48] his righteousness will cover us because
[1:20:51] it's not what we did it's what he did
[1:20:55] we can no more save ourselves and we can
[1:20:58] you know jump over the moon with our
[1:20:59] bootstraps or or do something like that
[1:21:01] we can't do it and you can't wait till
[1:21:04] you're good enough because that'll never
[1:21:06] happen
[1:21:07] and you know the ones that are safe
[1:21:09] Sanctified Holy Ghost still still aren't
[1:21:11] good enough
[1:21:12] still aren't good enough but it's his
[1:21:14] Mercy it's an ongoing Mercy it's ongoing
[1:21:18] clothing it's an ongoing washing just
[1:21:20] because you have a white Road doesn't
[1:21:22] mean it's never going to get dirty
[1:21:24] right
[1:21:26] but you come to church and you pray to
[1:21:28] get it washed
[1:21:30] but you need the Rope to begin with
[1:21:33] because if you don't have The Robe then
[1:21:34] you're always dirty
[1:21:36] man you're always naked before God right
[1:21:38] it's a shameful thing we wear clothes to
[1:21:41] cover our shame
[1:21:43] we put on the righteousness of God to
[1:21:47] cover our spiritual shame
[1:21:49] because sin is a shameful thing
[1:21:55] so he said for he hath clothed me with
[1:21:57] the garments of Salvation he hath
[1:22:00] covered me with the robe of
[1:22:01] righteousness he
[1:22:03] not I put on
[1:22:05] he covered me with the Robes of
[1:22:07] righteousness
[1:22:09] as a bridegroom decath himself with
[1:22:12] ornaments and as a bride adorneth
[1:22:14] herself with jewels
[1:22:17] because remember
[1:22:19] physical taking off clothes is a sign of
[1:22:22] demon possession
[1:22:25] Legion did it
[1:22:27] and what did he do
[1:22:28] he deeply says that after Jesus cast out
[1:22:31] the the
[1:22:33] and then his right mind right
[1:22:38] and remember them sons of shifa shivas
[1:22:40] in the book of Acts there
[1:22:43] when they try to do what Paul did
[1:22:45] without having the inspiration
[1:22:46] themselves
[1:22:48] mentally
[1:22:51] and when the demon jumped off of them
[1:22:54] off of the person they're trying to cast
[1:22:56] them out onto them
[1:22:58] the immediate side effects was tearing
[1:23:00] off their clothes and running around
[1:23:01] naked ran out naked
[1:23:07] but the sad part is when they don't know
[1:23:09] it
[1:23:11] because he's made a way
[1:23:13] he has made a way for us to be clothed
[1:23:17] the Judgment comes when he's made the
[1:23:19] way and then the way is rejected right
[1:23:21] that's where judgment comes
[1:23:27] let's go to Revelations 10 because this
[1:23:29] is a wonderful beautiful example of
[1:23:30] clothes
[1:23:31] talking about clothed in his
[1:23:33] righteousness
[1:23:43] Revelations 10 1 and I saw another
[1:23:46] Mighty Angel come down from heaven
[1:23:50] clothed with a cloud
[1:23:53] and a rainbow was upon his head and his
[1:23:55] feet was as it were the Sun and his feet
[1:23:57] as pillars of Fire
[1:23:59] so we have Jesus Christ coming down and
[1:24:01] he is clothed with the cloud because
[1:24:04] it's judgment time
[1:24:06] and the cloud all seven Messengers are
[1:24:09] represented in that cloud
[1:24:10] because what happens when people spurn
[1:24:12] Mercy judgment
[1:24:15] so the entire revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:24:18] he comes down clothed with that in
[1:24:20] Revelation 10. right
[1:24:22] so if you want to be in the Rapture
[1:24:24] you've got to clothe yourself with that
[1:24:27] cloud
[1:24:29] with the revelation of who he is
[1:24:32] right because remember he brings down
[1:24:34] judgment
[1:24:36] for rejecting the word
[1:24:39] so we have got to be clothed he came
[1:24:41] down clothed in a cloud
[1:24:44] right and all seven messages are
[1:24:46] represented right in that cloud so we
[1:24:49] are to take that because all seven
[1:24:50] abortions have been given to us amen so
[1:24:52] we are to take that message
[1:24:55] and clothe ourselves with it
[1:24:58] anything else is nakedness right
[1:25:00] anything other
[1:25:03] than clothing ourselves with the word of
[1:25:04] God is nakedness
[1:25:06] and that's exactly God can see right
[1:25:08] through it
[1:25:10] God you know we can fool people but you
[1:25:13] can never fool God
[1:25:16] can see right through what you're doing
[1:25:19] what you're thinking is it genuine are
[1:25:22] you doing it to show other people are
[1:25:23] you doing something on purpose in front
[1:25:25] of people to make them think something
[1:25:27] of you that's not right God can see that
[1:25:31] so when we do that
[1:25:34] we found naked before God
[1:25:36] help us to always be honest and genuine
[1:25:42] we are to be clothed in his
[1:25:43] righteousness
[1:25:45] because God gave us the clothing
[1:25:48] so on the day of judgment if we're found
[1:25:51] naked before him he's going to ask why
[1:25:54] why did we sit in a message Church
[1:25:58] hear the word preached hear the tapes
[1:26:00] preached and you're you're standing here
[1:26:02] before me naked
[1:26:07] when we're going to be asked to give a
[1:26:09] reason why right
[1:26:14] we have less excuse than anyone else
[1:26:17] Martin Luther did not have the
[1:26:18] Vindication that we have in this message
[1:26:24] is Jesus Christ
[1:26:26] it's not we'll bless God you know I can
[1:26:30] I've got I've got it all it's not about
[1:26:31] that it's about Jesus right right you
[1:26:34] know it's not
[1:26:36] I'm you know we're we're we're we're
[1:26:38] right and everyone else is wrong just
[1:26:40] because they're just because we say they
[1:26:42] are it's Jesus's right his word is right
[1:26:46] and everything else
[1:26:48] is going to go into judgment everything
[1:26:51] else is going to go to hell
[1:26:52] his word
[1:26:55] if you reject the word there's nothing
[1:26:58] left but judgment right if you reject
[1:27:01] the clothing that God provides there's
[1:27:04] nothing left but judgment right
[1:27:07] you know and there's no point in trying
[1:27:09] to look the part
[1:27:11] if you're not the part right
[1:27:13] you become the part and then you look
[1:27:16] the part
[1:27:17] because it happens from the inside out
[1:27:20] you know and if we have a need from him
[1:27:22] and we pull on him you know if we need
[1:27:25] more faith we don't try and put it on we
[1:27:28] wait until he adds it
[1:27:30] you know he gives it to us
[1:27:33] it's a he does it all right
[1:27:37] he does it all
[1:27:39] in Revelations 19.
[1:27:42] it says let us be glad and rejoice
[1:27:46] and give honor to him
[1:27:49] for the marriage of the Lamb excuse me
[1:27:52] for the marriage of the Lamb is calm
[1:27:55] and his wife hath made herself ready
[1:27:59] in the sermon
[1:28:01] marriage of the Lamb brother Graham said
[1:28:04] that she has everything she needs on
[1:28:06] earth now to get herself ready
[1:28:09] she has the material on earth now to get
[1:28:13] herself ready
[1:28:15] so the question is are we getting
[1:28:18] dressed in this
[1:28:22] right because
[1:28:23] half of a dress is a miniskirt
[1:28:27] and you're still naked right so half of
[1:28:30] the words you're still naked
[1:28:33] you know part of the word you're a pant
[1:28:35] leg or whatever you know I mean just
[1:28:37] figuratively speaking here
[1:28:40] or shorts or something you know
[1:28:42] we want to be clothed
[1:28:45] and this isn't just you know
[1:28:48] you know you come through the doors here
[1:28:49] comes the tape measure are you right no
[1:28:51] you got to go back put more no no that's
[1:28:54] not what it's about that's just a
[1:28:56] natural type in the spiritual
[1:28:58] because if you're right on the inside
[1:28:59] you want to be right on out if you're
[1:29:01] right on the inside you're going to want
[1:29:02] to be right on the outside
[1:29:05] and to her to this bride
[1:29:08] was granted that she should be arrayed
[1:29:10] in fine linen
[1:29:12] clean and white for the fine linen is
[1:29:16] the righteousness of the Saints right
[1:29:19] and he saith unto me right blessed are
[1:29:21] they which are called unto the mayor's
[1:29:22] supper of the lamb and they saith unto
[1:29:24] me these are the true sayings of God so
[1:29:26] to her it was granted the material is on
[1:29:29] earth now to get yourself ready
[1:29:33] there's nothing else coming
[1:29:36] it's been given
[1:29:40] because that is
[1:29:42] you know unfortunately can be kind of a
[1:29:44] big contention
[1:29:45] in the circles of the message and things
[1:29:47] because
[1:29:48] my opinion has been this if there's
[1:29:50] something else coming
[1:29:51] then people get relaxed and waiting for
[1:29:54] something to Quicken them into the
[1:29:55] rapture
[1:29:57] so imagine what a position that puts
[1:29:59] them in
[1:30:01] because remember you know shouldn't
[1:30:03] Elijah have already come
[1:30:05] and what did Jesus tell him he's already
[1:30:06] come and he didn't know it
[1:30:10] because brother am sent a church age
[1:30:11] book that the messenger only appears
[1:30:13] once in each age right
[1:30:17] he appears once and the material has
[1:30:19] been given to get ourselves ready
[1:30:24] in present stage of my Ministry
[1:30:27] brother random says
[1:30:32] I'm trusting in Him someday
[1:30:36] I don't know when
[1:30:38] for a crowning of my ministry right
[1:30:42] I've stayed just as true as I could be
[1:30:45] I don't know when what it'll be
[1:30:48] I don't know when it'll be
[1:30:50] and just when he's ready I'm done up
[1:30:52] here
[1:30:53] I hope he will Crown my Ministry of this
[1:30:58] of letting me take the clothes of the
[1:31:00] word
[1:31:02] and dress his bride
[1:31:06] in the clothes of the word and for his
[1:31:08] righteousness that's right I hope he
[1:31:11] will Crown me and let me say on the
[1:31:13] stand on that day say Behold the Lamb of
[1:31:16] God that takes away the sin of the world
[1:31:19] he hopes that the crowning of his
[1:31:21] ministry will be to dress the bride in
[1:31:23] the word exactly and remember when he
[1:31:25] had the vision of the brides the
[1:31:27] denominations and the true bride
[1:31:29] those were naked
[1:31:31] remember all they have was a fig leaf
[1:31:33] and they were dancing to the tune of
[1:31:34] rock and roll
[1:31:36] so you go to the to different churches
[1:31:39] and they're dressed nice they're dressed
[1:31:40] fine
[1:31:41] but God in the vision show brother Brown
[1:31:44] they were naked because that's how he
[1:31:46] saw them right
[1:31:48] but he seen the bride clothes amen
[1:31:52] you know and I think it's interesting
[1:31:54] that the bride was clothed respective to
[1:31:56] where she lives to the country
[1:31:58] and the message is being translated in
[1:32:00] all the tongues they hear it
[1:32:03] you know the French hear it in their
[1:32:05] tongue
[1:32:06] and they get dressed in it and they look
[1:32:08] French it's the same word
[1:32:11] the Germans and all of them each
[1:32:13] respective as they're coming as the word
[1:32:15] was given to them in their tongue they
[1:32:17] received it and were dressed in it and
[1:32:18] they were walking in tune to the word
[1:32:20] clothed
[1:32:23] remember May the prophet sick to his
[1:32:25] stomach to see the
[1:32:26] the other ones
[1:32:28] of how they were dancing how vulgar and
[1:32:30] things
[1:32:31] that's right but the true bride are
[1:32:33] going to take the word that's been given
[1:32:36] and dress themselves in it
[1:32:42] because brother Brown dramatizes so
[1:32:44] beautifully you know the nakedness that
[1:32:46] happened in the Garden of Eden as it
[1:32:48] came on down and then he was that Lamb
[1:32:50] of God remember he says that
[1:32:54] you know he says what do I hear a Thump
[1:32:55] Thump Thump coming down the cobblestones
[1:32:59] I'm going to read it it's a little long
[1:33:01] but y'all please bear with me because
[1:33:02] nobody can dramatize it like the prophet
[1:33:05] can
[1:33:11] it's uh I will restore until you saith
[1:33:13] the Lord
[1:33:18] we'll start in verse 23 brother
[1:33:22] this was after the fall
[1:33:24] but God went out and got some skins he
[1:33:26] must have killed some sheep and innocent
[1:33:27] substitute throwed it in there and they
[1:33:30] wrapped these sheepskins around him and
[1:33:32] here they come out to face God
[1:33:34] now I can see them standing there and
[1:33:36] Adam that great manly shoulders the
[1:33:39] blood off them sheepskins running down
[1:33:40] his legs I can see Eve standing there in
[1:33:43] her beautiful form and all this Blood
[1:33:44] running over now Adam crying Eve a
[1:33:48] crying mixing with tears as it run down
[1:33:50] their bosoms like that Eve leaning over
[1:33:52] on his shoulder and God depart out of my
[1:33:54] presence
[1:33:56] he couldn't stand it it hurt God to do
[1:33:58] that
[1:33:59] but when his children went to walk away
[1:34:01] let's take a little drama here for a
[1:34:03] minute I can hear something going like
[1:34:05] this
[1:34:07] what is it it's the old bloody
[1:34:10] sheepskins beating against atoms big
[1:34:12] manly legs as he was walking out of the
[1:34:14] presence of God God couldn't stand it
[1:34:16] and all that great he turns he come down
[1:34:18] to four letters
[1:34:20] l-o-v-e God so loved he couldn't see his
[1:34:23] children go out in that kind of a
[1:34:25] condition separating from him he stopped
[1:34:27] and he said wait a minute I'll put
[1:34:30] enmity between your seed and the serpent
[1:34:32] seed promising a savior he said let's
[1:34:35] turn our camera now 4 000 years later
[1:34:37] there's a great carrying on in Jerusalem
[1:34:39] we're sitting in a building saying and
[1:34:41] we say what is all that noise about
[1:34:43] where did it come from look out somebody
[1:34:45] said well there's a Holy Roller out
[1:34:47] there they're going to crucify him this
[1:34:49] morning he's done nothing but just tear
[1:34:50] up the churches around here and
[1:34:52] everything so they're going to crucify
[1:34:53] him
[1:34:54] let's go out the window and look out
[1:34:56] there comes a man down the street over
[1:34:59] them cobblestones dragging an Old Rugged
[1:35:01] Cross
[1:35:02] he's got a garment on woe without seams
[1:35:05] as he starts to go golfing on her
[1:35:08] I began to look on his back and I see
[1:35:10] little red spots all over his coat I say
[1:35:12] what are those red spots I keep watching
[1:35:14] them as he goes the spots get bigger and
[1:35:17] bigger bigger now they all run into one
[1:35:20] great big bloody spot I hear something
[1:35:23] going
[1:35:26] what is it the second Adam the Redeemer
[1:35:31] going Yonder to Calvary bearing away the
[1:35:33] Lamb of God taking the sin of the world
[1:35:36] of beyond Earth to Calvary the most
[1:35:38] pathetic picture was ever pictured How
[1:35:41] could a sinner look in the face of that
[1:35:43] and remain a sinner is more than I can
[1:35:45] tell you he says
[1:35:47] the very same picture that was in the
[1:35:49] Garden of Eden and tight was fulfilled
[1:35:51] in direct manifestation 2000 years later
[1:35:56] God's substitution for us
[1:36:00] one was
[1:36:01] in type
[1:36:03] and then the negative became a positive
[1:36:09] he didn't do it he didn't do a thing to
[1:36:11] deserve that
[1:36:13] he didn't do a single thing to deserve
[1:36:16] what he got
[1:36:17] it right
[1:36:19] but he did it because he had you on his
[1:36:21] mind
[1:36:23] and what we've got to remember and
[1:36:25] believe with all our hearts is that if
[1:36:27] you as an individual would be the only
[1:36:29] one
[1:36:30] he had to do that for he would have done
[1:36:33] it
[1:36:33] that's how we have to believe him yeah
[1:36:37] he would have done it if I would have
[1:36:39] been the only one right he would have
[1:36:41] still done all that
[1:36:43] he didn't do it because we were cheaper
[1:36:45] wholesale you know and I pray they don't
[1:36:47] sound sacrilegious but he didn't do it
[1:36:49] because he had so many
[1:36:52] he done it if it you would have been the
[1:36:54] only one he still would have done
[1:36:55] everything
[1:36:59] it wouldn't have changed nothing he
[1:37:02] still would have suffered he still would
[1:37:04] have been beat to a pulp
[1:37:06] to his rib Shone through
[1:37:09] and you'd have been the only one on his
[1:37:11] mind
[1:37:15] amen that's what kind of God we serve
[1:37:19] when he does that and he pays that price
[1:37:21] and then it's rejected and it's like
[1:37:23] slapping him in the face
[1:37:26] Psalm 132 9 says let thy priests be
[1:37:30] clothed with righteousness and let thy
[1:37:31] Saints shout for Joy right
[1:37:35] you know brother Ram said that the
[1:37:36] priests the Levites is the type of the
[1:37:38] Bride
[1:37:39] he said because when there was sin in
[1:37:41] the camp they were the ones that Drew
[1:37:43] the swords and went and stood by Moses
[1:37:44] right
[1:37:46] and stood for the word drew the word and
[1:37:48] slew sin right and God says since you've
[1:37:51] done that from now on you're gonna be
[1:37:52] separated into me right
[1:37:54] right and that's what the bride does
[1:37:57] she separated a separated people unto
[1:38:00] him
[1:38:02] Ecclesiastes 9 8 says let thy garments
[1:38:05] be always White
[1:38:06] and let thy head lack no ointment
[1:38:12] you always want to be fresh fresh
[1:38:13] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:38:16] let your garments always be white
[1:38:18] and let your head
[1:38:20] lack no ointment
[1:38:23] because we want real Faith because real
[1:38:25] faith is what pleases God
[1:38:28] mental Faith does not please
[1:38:29] intellectual conceptions does not please
[1:38:31] God intellectual conception can please a
[1:38:34] man
[1:38:35] but not God
[1:38:37] and Only God
[1:38:39] knows what you really have
[1:38:42] because we see people playing the part
[1:38:44] all the time and then renounce the
[1:38:46] message
[1:38:47] because the word has got to go from here
[1:38:49] to here right brother the word when it's
[1:38:51] priest is received right to the womb of
[1:38:53] the Mind womb of the spirit and from
[1:38:55] here it's got to go down to the heart
[1:38:57] right and then out of the abundance of
[1:38:59] the heart the mouth speaking
[1:39:02] God wants faith
[1:39:04] we know that faith is a revelation
[1:39:08] because intellectual faith is still an
[1:39:10] echiness
[1:39:12] real faith is clothing real faith is his
[1:39:16] righteousness
[1:39:19] because remember
[1:39:20] we all know the familiar text about
[1:39:23] Peter when Jesus asked Peter whom do man
[1:39:26] say that I was son of man I am
[1:39:29] and Peter knew he had a revelation
[1:39:33] he said Thou Art the Christ the son of
[1:39:37] the Living God let's go to Matthew
[1:39:39] chapter 16.
[1:39:47] and Saint John
[1:39:48] six remember when everyone deserted
[1:39:50] Jesus
[1:39:51] Peter stood he said where else can we go
[1:39:53] for thou alone has the word of eternal
[1:39:55] life
[1:39:58] Matthew 13 I'm sorry Matthew 16 verse
[1:40:02] 13.
[1:40:09] when Jesus came into the coast of
[1:40:11] caesarea Philippi he asked his disciples
[1:40:13] saying whom do men say that I the son of
[1:40:16] man I am and they said some say
[1:40:19] the Thou Art John the Baptist
[1:40:23] some Elijah Elijah and others Jeremiah
[1:40:26] are one of the prophets he saith unto
[1:40:28] them but whom say ye that I am right
[1:40:32] right and Simon Peter answered and said
[1:40:33] Thou Art the Christ the son of the
[1:40:35] Living God right so the question is put
[1:40:37] to us who do you say this message is
[1:40:40] right who do you say brother Branham
[1:40:43] introduced
[1:40:46] who do you say came down in Revelation
[1:40:49] 10. whom do you say came down over
[1:40:51] sunset Mountain what is what is the
[1:40:53] attraction on the mountain who do you
[1:40:55] say this is what shall you do with his
[1:40:58] Jesus called Christ
[1:41:00] it's all back in our laps again
[1:41:03] so Peter had a revelation of who Jesus
[1:41:06] Christ was and Jesus
[1:41:09] answered and said unto him blessed art
[1:41:11] thou Simon barjona for Flesh and Blood
[1:41:14] hath not revealed it unto thee but my
[1:41:16] Father which is in heaven right and I
[1:41:18] say also unto thee that thou art Peter
[1:41:20] and Upon This Rock I will build my
[1:41:22] church and the Gates of Hell shall not
[1:41:24] Prevail against it
[1:41:26] Jesus admitted that Peter had a
[1:41:28] revelation given to him by God and not
[1:41:31] flesh and blood right
[1:41:36] so now I want to actually just bring it
[1:41:39] up a little bit
[1:41:40] I want to pinch it a little bit
[1:41:42] because let's read a little further on
[1:41:44] down
[1:41:45] let's read in verse 21 or let's uh yeah
[1:41:49] verse 21 and from that time forth
[1:41:52] begin Jesus to show unto his disciples
[1:41:55] how he must go into Jerusalem and suffer
[1:41:57] many things of the elders and chief
[1:41:59] priests and scribes and be killed and be
[1:42:01] raised again the third day
[1:42:03] than Peter
[1:42:04] took him and began to rebuke him saying
[1:42:07] be AFR from the Lord this is not this
[1:42:10] shall not be unto thee and he turned and
[1:42:12] said unto Peter
[1:42:13] get thee behind me Satan for thou art
[1:42:16] thou art in offense unto me for thou
[1:42:19] savior is not the things that be of God
[1:42:20] but those that be of men right
[1:42:24] so Peter knew who Jesus Christ was
[1:42:28] and right there Satan used him to try
[1:42:31] and keep Jesus from going to fulfill the
[1:42:33] word right
[1:42:35] you say well how are you trying to bring
[1:42:37] it up
[1:42:38] we know
[1:42:40] you a person can have a revelation that
[1:42:43] God sent a message
[1:42:45] they can have a revelation and say
[1:42:47] brother Branham is a prophet and I know
[1:42:49] that he had thus saith the Lord
[1:42:51] but still not be saved still not have
[1:42:54] the Holy Ghost
[1:42:56] but they have a true revelation
[1:43:00] and believe it and respect it but not
[1:43:03] walk in it right right
[1:43:04] because Peter did that
[1:43:07] you remember what Jesus told Peter
[1:43:09] he said Simon Simon behold Satan hath
[1:43:13] desire to have you that he may sift you
[1:43:15] as wheat
[1:43:16] but I have prayed for thee that thy
[1:43:19] faith fell not and when thou art
[1:43:20] converted right strengthen thy Brethren
[1:43:23] when thou art converted
[1:43:26] remember Peter try to stop Jesus his
[1:43:28] entire mission
[1:43:30] what's the coming down on the cross that
[1:43:31] was a climax of his mission
[1:43:33] for us amen and be raised in things
[1:43:37] and Peter
[1:43:39] try to stop him from doing that now
[1:43:40] Jesus did not call
[1:43:42] Peter Satan it was Satan speaking
[1:43:44] through Peter
[1:43:46] carnal mind coming out there that we're
[1:43:48] all subject to
[1:43:50] so Peter remember then when they came to
[1:43:53] take Jesus to the Cross what did he do
[1:43:55] he pulled out a sword and cut this the
[1:43:57] high priest sermon here off
[1:44:00] why he was trying to defend Jesus in a
[1:44:02] carnal way
[1:44:03] Jesus was doing exactly what the word
[1:44:05] said he was supposed to do but Peter was
[1:44:08] still trying to defend him in the
[1:44:09] natural
[1:44:11] remember after the resurrection
[1:44:13] he went fishing
[1:44:16] there were rumors that he raised they
[1:44:18] seemed his Idol Tales to them
[1:44:21] Jesus had been telling them the whole
[1:44:23] time I must go sir at the hands of
[1:44:26] Sinners be raised
[1:44:29] and remember Peter
[1:44:31] they're not Jesus not once not twice but
[1:44:35] three times and he cursed by doing it
[1:44:39] but he had the revelation of who Jesus
[1:44:42] was
[1:44:43] but it takes more than that that's right
[1:44:46] he knew that God that Jesus was God in
[1:44:49] flesh
[1:44:52] but G but the Holy Ghost did not yet
[1:44:53] come yet to indwell him right
[1:44:58] because remember
[1:45:01] Jesus
[1:45:02] the Holy Ghost will point someone to the
[1:45:04] word
[1:45:04] sure
[1:45:06] if a person gets the Holy Ghost
[1:45:09] in the denominational Church they're not
[1:45:11] going to stay there
[1:45:12] he's gonna bring him right to the word
[1:45:15] you know I mean someone can get the Holy
[1:45:17] Ghost while belonging to a denomination
[1:45:19] right
[1:45:20] but it'll lead him right to the word of
[1:45:22] the day
[1:45:24] because where the carcass is the Eagles
[1:45:26] will be gathered together so the eagle
[1:45:27] is going to go find the carcass where is
[1:45:30] the freshest kill
[1:45:36] ER let's go to John 16.
[1:45:40] because remember why Jesus was breaking
[1:45:42] down the word to him
[1:45:44] they were puzzled constantly by his
[1:45:45] parables
[1:45:48] in 16 verse 16.
[1:45:52] a little while and he shall not and he
[1:45:54] shall not see me and again a little
[1:45:56] while and he shall see me because I go
[1:45:57] to the father then said some of his
[1:46:00] disciples among themselves what is this
[1:46:01] that he saith unto us a little while and
[1:46:03] he shall not see me and again a little
[1:46:05] while and he shall see me and because I
[1:46:07] go to the father they were confused
[1:46:10] they said therefore what is this that he
[1:46:12] saith a little while we cannot tell what
[1:46:14] he saith
[1:46:16] so Jesus breaks it down for him
[1:46:18] break sit down breaks it down look in
[1:46:20] verse 29 his disciples said unto him Lo
[1:46:24] now speak is thou plainly and speak is
[1:46:27] no proverb
[1:46:29] now we are sure that thou knowest all
[1:46:32] things that need us not that any man
[1:46:33] should ask thee by this we believe that
[1:46:36] thou came us forth from God Jesus
[1:46:38] answered do you now believe
[1:46:41] it they needed everything spelled out to
[1:46:43] him because remember the Holy Ghost is
[1:46:44] an inside teacher right that's right
[1:46:47] he recognized Peter recognized Jesus as
[1:46:50] the Messiah
[1:46:52] and could not even recognize the part of
[1:46:55] the word that that Jesus was fulfilling
[1:46:57] was going to be crucified he recognized
[1:46:59] that portion and Jesus blessed him for
[1:47:03] it
[1:47:03] but there's more
[1:47:06] because I want us to go now and compare
[1:47:09] Peter before he got the Holy Ghost to
[1:47:13] Peter after he got the Holy Ghost and
[1:47:16] see what that indwelling did to him
[1:47:18] let's go to Acts chapter 2.
[1:47:22] remember Jesus said after you're
[1:47:24] converted strengthen your brethren he
[1:47:26] had some clothes on now
[1:47:28] he had the righteousness of God now now
[1:47:31] he understood exactly
[1:47:33] a little while you see me and then he
[1:47:35] won't and then you will again yeah
[1:47:37] yeah because he's experienced it right
[1:47:38] amen
[1:47:43] in Acts 2 verse 14.
[1:47:46] this is after the day of Pentecost but
[1:47:49] Peter's standing up with the eleven
[1:47:50] lifted up his voice and said unto them
[1:47:52] he men of Judea and all ye that dwell at
[1:47:55] Jerusalem be this known unto you and
[1:47:57] hearken to my words for these are not
[1:47:59] drunken as ye supposed seeing it is but
[1:48:02] the third hour of the day but this is
[1:48:05] that right
[1:48:07] which was spoken by the prophet Joel
[1:48:12] he didn't have to go pray and ask the
[1:48:14] Lord tell me tell me what this means
[1:48:15] please break it down for me he said this
[1:48:17] is that this is what was already written
[1:48:21] coming to pass then Peter can say this
[1:48:24] day this scripture is fulfilled in your
[1:48:26] eyes in your ears
[1:48:29] because it brought him to the word that
[1:48:31] was being manifested right then Peter
[1:48:33] was brought to the fresh kill of the day
[1:48:36] which was the prophecy of Joel 2 28.
[1:48:39] right
[1:48:40] that's what Peter was brought to
[1:48:42] he said this is that and he quotes the
[1:48:45] prophet Joel and as and it shall come to
[1:48:47] pass in the last day saith God I will
[1:48:49] pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and
[1:48:51] your sons and your daughters shall
[1:48:52] prophesy in your young men shall see
[1:48:54] visions and your old men shall dream
[1:48:56] dreams
[1:48:57] and it's going on down
[1:48:59] let's go to verse 25.
[1:49:03] and he's going in the Old Testament and
[1:49:05] he's going to pull out exactly who Jesus
[1:49:06] was with the Holy Ghost out of the word
[1:49:10] for David speaketh concerning him I
[1:49:13] foresaw the lord always before my face
[1:49:14] for he is on my right hand that I should
[1:49:17] not be moved therefore did my heart
[1:49:19] Rejoice my tongue was glad moreover also
[1:49:22] my flesh shall Rest In Hope Glory
[1:49:24] because that would not leave my soul in
[1:49:26] Hell neither without suffer thine Holy
[1:49:28] One to see corruption so that's why
[1:49:31] Jesus couldn't stay in the grave longer
[1:49:33] than three days
[1:49:34] now it made sense to Peter if Peter if
[1:49:37] Peter had the Holy Ghost you know we
[1:49:40] know that wasn't possible because Jesus
[1:49:41] hadn't died yet right but he could see
[1:49:43] the word being made manifest so after
[1:49:46] the Holy Ghost he was able to say this
[1:49:47] is that he knew what he was talking
[1:49:50] about because God is the highest form of
[1:49:52] because the highest form of God is his
[1:49:54] word right
[1:49:56] right he said this is that
[1:49:57] in verse 27 because that would not leave
[1:50:00] my soul in Hell neither will thou suffer
[1:50:02] thine Holy One to see corruption thou
[1:50:04] Hast made known to me the ways of life
[1:50:06] that shall make me full of joy with thy
[1:50:09] countenance men and Brethren let me
[1:50:11] freely speak unto you the patriarch
[1:50:13] David
[1:50:15] that he is both dead and buried in his
[1:50:17] sepulchers with us unto this day
[1:50:19] therefore being a prophet and knowing
[1:50:21] that God has sworn with an oath to him
[1:50:23] that the fruit of his loins according to
[1:50:25] the flesh he would raise up Christ to
[1:50:27] sit on his throne he's seeing this
[1:50:29] before spake of the resurrection of
[1:50:30] Christ that his soul was not left in
[1:50:32] Hell neither his flesh did see
[1:50:35] corruption
[1:50:37] so he was able to see that in the Old
[1:50:39] Testament and pull it out and preach it
[1:50:41] Stephen did the same thing you can go
[1:50:43] read Stephen's sermon and he starts all
[1:50:46] the way with Abraham and he brings Jesus
[1:50:48] all the way down on that horizontal
[1:50:50] rainbow with the Holy Ghost the
[1:50:52] disciples could not do that before the
[1:50:54] Holy Ghost
[1:50:55] right before the Holy Ghost it was just
[1:50:58] proverbs
[1:51:00] tell us what you mean
[1:51:05] but after the Holy Ghost this is that
[1:51:07] right
[1:51:08] this there's Malachi 4 this is that when
[1:51:12] he came this is what he did Revelation
[1:51:13] 10. this is it Revelations 10 7 1-7
[1:51:17] so where are we at now Revelations 10 8
[1:51:19] to 11. take this little book this day
[1:51:21] this scripture is fulfilled
[1:51:24] manifesting the word
[1:51:26] right going back to the word
[1:51:29] how many people you know we are very
[1:51:32] blessed people
[1:51:34] when they asked Peter you know men and
[1:51:36] Brethren what shall we do to be saved
[1:51:38] well Jesus said baptize the name of the
[1:51:41] father name of the father son or Holy
[1:51:42] Ghost
[1:51:43] but the inside teacher said that was the
[1:51:45] Lord Jesus Christ he had a revelation of
[1:51:47] who he was
[1:51:49] you know before the Holy Ghost he might
[1:51:51] have baptized in the name of Father Son
[1:51:53] and Holy Ghost is that right but after
[1:51:55] he knew that the father Son and Holy
[1:51:57] Ghost was the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[1:51:59] because he was that which was written
[1:52:02] right
[1:52:04] Peter was able to tell them
[1:52:08] how they could be saved and now when
[1:52:10] they heard this they were pricked in
[1:52:11] their heart and said unto Peter and to
[1:52:14] the rest of the Apostles being in
[1:52:15] Brethren what shall we do how shall we
[1:52:17] get clothed they recognized they were
[1:52:19] naked
[1:52:21] remember in Acts chapter 19 when Paul
[1:52:23] came to the to the upper coast of
[1:52:25] Ephesus
[1:52:26] and he said you don't ask him how they
[1:52:28] were baptized and he sent it to John's
[1:52:30] baptism he said that won't work anymore
[1:52:31] right all of a sudden they realized that
[1:52:33] they were naked
[1:52:35] so they want her to be closed so they
[1:52:37] came and got baptized in the name of the
[1:52:39] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:52:41] because they wanted to be clothed
[1:52:45] then Peter said unto them repent and be
[1:52:47] baptized every one of you in the name of
[1:52:49] Jesus Christ for the remission of sins
[1:52:51] and he shall receive the gifts of the
[1:52:52] Holy Ghost for the promises unto you and
[1:52:56] to your children it's them that are far
[1:52:57] off that's us and as many as the Lord
[1:52:59] Our God shall call
[1:53:02] Peter could preach then
[1:53:05] Peter had something to say then
[1:53:08] he could preach Jesus Christ out of the
[1:53:10] Old Testament just say Paul could
[1:53:12] exactly
[1:53:13] take the Old Testament scriptures and
[1:53:15] point them right to Jesus Christ
[1:53:18] remember when the blind man sat at the
[1:53:20] gate called beautiful and that he wanted
[1:53:21] some money wanted alms he said Silver
[1:53:24] and Gold Have I None right but such as I
[1:53:26] had this robe of righteousness I'll give
[1:53:28] unto you
[1:53:29] in the name of Jesus Christ rise up and
[1:53:31] walk and the man leaked to his feet and
[1:53:33] they couldn't deny it the Bible says
[1:53:35] because the man was there
[1:53:38] now here's another side effects of the
[1:53:40] Holy Ghost
[1:53:41] in Acts 4 13.
[1:53:46] you can read Peter's sermon in Acts 2
[1:53:49] and 3 all through there
[1:53:52] and when they saw the boldness of Peter
[1:53:54] and John and foresee that they were
[1:53:55] unlearned and ignorant man they marveled
[1:53:57] and they took knowledge of them that
[1:54:00] they had been with Jesus
[1:54:03] they were with Jesus in the physical
[1:54:05] before the Holy Ghost
[1:54:07] but yet they weren't able to to do
[1:54:09] anything remember they were defeated on
[1:54:11] the epilepsy case
[1:54:14] they wouldn't have been defeated after
[1:54:15] right
[1:54:19] because they were able
[1:54:21] by the Holy Ghost
[1:54:24] to impart eternal life
[1:54:29] to impart the robe of righteousness now
[1:54:32] amen
[1:54:35] God himself and Jesus Christ is the only
[1:54:37] author of eternal life
[1:54:40] but God can put the believer in such a
[1:54:42] place
[1:54:43] where he can impart eternal life into
[1:54:46] others
[1:54:48] right now I'll read some quotes here
[1:54:49] because brother random said and I didn't
[1:54:50] and that's what that's why it's so good
[1:54:53] yeah that's why I can stand behind it
[1:54:54] and say Amen because you think how can a
[1:54:56] sinner
[1:54:57] saved by grace how can one human give
[1:55:00] life to the other remember a seed it
[1:55:02] takes a union to make a seed
[1:55:04] so if you speak the word to somebody and
[1:55:07] they don't have the seed within them you
[1:55:10] can't impart eternal life to that person
[1:55:11] because it takes a seed is a union
[1:55:15] it's not one-sided
[1:55:17] it takes a man and a woman
[1:55:20] to make a child to make a conception
[1:55:23] then it's a seed
[1:55:25] but in Saint John 14 12.
[1:55:29] Jesus said verily verily I say unto you
[1:55:32] he that believeth on me the works that I
[1:55:35] do shall he do also and Greater Works
[1:55:38] then thee shall he do because I go into
[1:55:41] my father now remember Jesus said if I
[1:55:43] don't go up to the Father the Holy Ghost
[1:55:44] can't come
[1:55:46] the only way the Holy Ghost can come is
[1:55:49] if I go up to the father right and then
[1:55:51] he'll come and he'll lead you and guide
[1:55:53] you into all truth
[1:55:56] now brother Brandon I'm here I'm about
[1:55:58] to read it for you
[1:56:00] that the greater things that Jesus was
[1:56:02] talking about was the impartation of
[1:56:04] eternal life to others
[1:56:07] he said
[1:56:09] in that day on Calvary
[1:56:15] he said now notice the Greater Works
[1:56:18] was to have the power in the church not
[1:56:21] only to heal the Sick by prayer cast out
[1:56:22] Devils by prayer but to impart eternal
[1:56:25] life to believers
[1:56:27] the Holy Ghost was coming and given into
[1:56:30] the hands of the church to impart life
[1:56:34] he said oh that's what Calvary meant it
[1:56:37] took stoop degraded men and women and
[1:56:40] lifted them up into a place to be Sons
[1:56:41] and Daughters of God to heal the sick
[1:56:44] and to impart eternal life
[1:56:47] by giving the Holy Ghost to obedient
[1:56:50] believers who were once unbelievers be
[1:56:52] made Believers and impart spiritual
[1:56:55] eternal life
[1:56:58] how much greater is it to say how much
[1:57:01] greater is it to say to the sick woman
[1:57:02] laying here I can prayer Pray I can pray
[1:57:05] a prayer of faith and shall be healed
[1:57:07] that's a great thing that's what he was
[1:57:09] doing then but he said greater than this
[1:57:11] shall you do I'm going to give you power
[1:57:14] not only to raise them up for a while
[1:57:16] but to give him eternal life which will
[1:57:19] be Eternal forever
[1:57:22] he said poor blind wretched people how
[1:57:25] do you miss that don't you see what the
[1:57:27] greater thing is that's the greatest
[1:57:29] thing that could ever happen was to
[1:57:31] impart eternal life to people
[1:57:33] you say well how does a mortal impart
[1:57:37] eternal life to someone else by
[1:57:38] preaching the word by witnessing by
[1:57:41] telling them about Jesus that when they
[1:57:43] receive it they're receiving Jesus
[1:57:45] Christ when you receive the word you
[1:57:48] receive Jesus Christ exactly right
[1:57:51] so you impart eternal life
[1:57:55] telling others about it
[1:57:57] right if they can receive it remember
[1:57:58] there's got to be the seed you can
[1:58:01] witness to people
[1:58:02] and be ever so inspired
[1:58:05] and the fall because you can't Quicken a
[1:58:07] rock
[1:58:08] and and
[1:58:10] that sounds like you're looking down on
[1:58:12] but it's not you know God has people in
[1:58:14] his economy but you've got to call what
[1:58:16] you've got to call it what it is
[1:58:18] remember God is known by his
[1:58:20] characteristics
[1:58:22] you know if if it flies like a duck and
[1:58:24] quacks like a duck then it is a duck or
[1:58:26] if it's a hard rock it's a rock
[1:58:30] you can't have a rock and say this is
[1:58:34] flower it's a rock it's got the
[1:58:36] characteristics of a rock right so in
[1:58:39] order to impart eternal life there's got
[1:58:40] to be the ability to receive the word on
[1:58:43] the other side right the other person
[1:58:45] so when the word is preached or the word
[1:58:47] is witnessed or the word is red
[1:58:49] and it's quick unto you and you receive
[1:58:52] the word you receive in God himself
[1:58:55] but where does the where does the life
[1:58:57] go through the body
[1:58:59] exactly
[1:59:00] the channel of life is through the body
[1:59:03] amen
[1:59:04] amen remember Jesus told the disciples
[1:59:06] whatsoever you bind on Earth abide in
[1:59:08] heaven right
[1:59:10] right they were his authority on the
[1:59:12] Earth
[1:59:13] because remember the bride is also like
[1:59:16] the blood of Jesus on the earth as well
[1:59:19] as a form of Mercy because what happens
[1:59:21] is when the bride leaves the Earth
[1:59:22] Mercy's Done Right amen I have a quote
[1:59:26] here where Rotherham says that the Holy
[1:59:28] Ghost in US
[1:59:30] will return back to him right
[1:59:32] right and we're going to go with it my
[1:59:34] brother devil said it to be in the
[1:59:36] Rapture you've got to be born again
[1:59:39] and it's not you're not going to be
[1:59:41] surprised that you made it right
[1:59:45] you're not going to be surprised you're
[1:59:48] gonna know
[1:59:49] that is how we must believe
[1:59:52] that's right you know how we're taught
[1:59:53] if there's only one person who's gonna
[1:59:54] make it it's going to be me
[1:59:56] that's how we must believe it
[2:00:01] and I looked the word in part
[2:00:03] just to see what the dictionary had to
[2:00:05] say
[2:00:06] and it means to make known
[2:00:09] to tell to relate to disclose
[2:00:12] because God's ordained way to speak the
[2:00:15] word is through man right whether it's
[2:00:18] preaching whether it's witnessing it's
[2:00:20] not just ministers exactly you impart
[2:00:23] eternal life everyone has got something
[2:00:25] to do amen
[2:00:27] nobody can take your place
[2:00:29] in the body of Christ
[2:00:31] no matter how little you may think your
[2:00:34] job is
[2:00:36] or that all you're doing is going
[2:00:37] through life and raising
[2:00:39] crying babies
[2:00:41] you know
[2:00:43] that is God's purpose for you
[2:00:47] because what happens is it's kind of
[2:00:48] like
[2:00:49] a speck of oil in God's Great machine on
[2:00:52] a big clock or years
[2:00:54] if the oil if that drop of oil is not
[2:00:56] there
[2:00:58] rust it's gonna eventually happen and
[2:01:01] then what happens to us it starts
[2:01:02] spreading and eating away the whole
[2:01:03] whole the whole system right so we've
[2:01:06] got to keep our place
[2:01:09] new man
[2:01:11] the Greater Works to impart eternal life
[2:01:13] the same you know we we were naked that
[2:01:16] the the grace of God that he would
[2:01:18] clothe us right with his righteousness
[2:01:21] and give us the opportunity to impart
[2:01:23] life to others right because remember
[2:01:25] the prophet said that whenever you give
[2:01:29] and you give to the ministry and they go
[2:01:31] out there and when them Souls that are
[2:01:33] won he said you'll get the credit for it
[2:01:35] because he said you're the one that
[2:01:37] sends me exactly we're not all called to
[2:01:40] go overseas but we can support those
[2:01:42] that are amen amen we hold our position
[2:01:45] by sending them and it's God's Great
[2:01:47] machine
[2:01:48] regarding the one with the football
[2:01:51] you know we're not all trying to get the
[2:01:53] ball from one another
[2:01:54] if somebody's got the ball you block for
[2:01:56] him someone's going overseas you pray
[2:01:58] for him you support them you support the
[2:02:01] work
[2:02:02] and over there
[2:02:03] God will know right God will allot it
[2:02:06] back to you God will a lot brother
[2:02:08] Branham himself as a prophet would a lot
[2:02:10] the success of meetings for people's
[2:02:13] prayers
[2:02:14] people that would lay on their face and
[2:02:16] pray for a meeting he would allot his
[2:02:18] success in Sinners coming to Christ that
[2:02:21] person had a share in his success and
[2:02:25] all they did was pray for the service
[2:02:27] like a rock
[2:02:28] and God
[2:02:30] knew it
[2:02:33] so we all must keep our place
[2:02:36] you know you could do you know God can
[2:02:38] bless you
[2:02:39] miss our way we'll take you know God
[2:02:40] could bless you financially to be able
[2:02:42] to support the work and that's your
[2:02:43] position
[2:02:44] and a person that may not be able to
[2:02:46] support it financially can be the prayer
[2:02:48] Warrior
[2:02:49] and the one that supports it financially
[2:02:51] can't pray through for that like that
[2:02:54] individual can right
[2:02:58] so we all keep our position we all keep
[2:03:01] our place we are all positionally placed
[2:03:03] in the body of Christ for our own for
[2:03:06] God's Own purpose and his will
[2:03:13] you know in another spot in the
[2:03:14] revelation of Jesus Christ Brethren says
[2:03:16] it again the Greater Works
[2:03:18] because remember the healing is just
[2:03:20] temporal God raised Lazarus Lazarus from
[2:03:23] the dead and he still died again
[2:03:25] everyone that was healed in the prophets
[2:03:28] meetings
[2:03:28] have still gone on or will if he tarries
[2:03:33] but those that had have had eternal life
[2:03:36] imparted to them right can never perish
[2:03:38] so that's the greater
[2:03:40] because remember in that verse Jesus
[2:03:42] said the works that I do shall he do
[2:03:44] also heal in the sick casting out the
[2:03:46] Devils but that's all like temporal but
[2:03:48] the greater the impartation of eternal
[2:03:51] life they'll be there for eternity amen
[2:03:54] there's nothing greater than life
[2:04:00] he said but when Jesus came and
[2:04:02] sacrificed his life and the Holy Ghost
[2:04:04] returned they could impart eternal life
[2:04:06] to the people right that's the greater
[2:04:10] that's a greater
[2:04:15] he's the author of eternal life
[2:04:17] but we as his children are like the
[2:04:19] messengers of eternal life this is how
[2:04:21] it is here's here's the road get dressed
[2:04:23] get dressed get dressed brother Ram type
[2:04:25] that it's trying to put medication in
[2:04:26] and and what if the doctor was trying to
[2:04:28] put forced medication out of somebody's
[2:04:31] mouth
[2:04:31] and she spit it out through his fingers
[2:04:35] that's what's being done
[2:04:37] you preach the word
[2:04:39] swallowing the medicine is up to the
[2:04:41] individual right
[2:04:43] you show them this is how you get
[2:04:46] dressed this is how you wear the robe of
[2:04:49] his righteousness right if you if the
[2:04:51] person don't put it on you're not
[2:04:53] responsible
[2:04:54] right but you're responsible for telling
[2:04:56] them
[2:04:58] but not for making them wear it
[2:05:04] remember in in Luke 18 8 when Jesus said
[2:05:07] I tell you that he nevertheless he said
[2:05:09] when the son of man cometh shall he find
[2:05:11] faith on the Earth
[2:05:14] that was the question
[2:05:17] because I believe that as the Lord
[2:05:19] tarries
[2:05:21] that the worldly get more worldly
[2:05:24] and the spiritual get more spiritual
[2:05:27] because as we're nearing as we're
[2:05:29] nearing the end of the end
[2:05:33] those that have been on board and have
[2:05:35] been trusting the Lord God is doing
[2:05:37] something wonderful with him right
[2:05:39] showing them things out of his word and
[2:05:41] giving them faith and and then the ones
[2:05:44] that have been in a mental conception
[2:05:46] walking away from it they're going worse
[2:05:49] and worse
[2:05:51] so in Luke 18 I want us to notice here a
[2:05:54] footnote of Schofield
[2:05:57] talking about will I find faith on the
[2:05:59] Earth
[2:06:01] Schofield says in his reference he said
[2:06:03] the reference is not to personal faith
[2:06:05] right
[2:06:06] but to belief in the whole body of
[2:06:09] revealed truth right
[2:06:12] well Jesus said when I come back to the
[2:06:13] Earth will I find
[2:06:15] belief right in the message of the hour
[2:06:18] so to speak right and the whole body of
[2:06:20] revealed truth
[2:06:23] well I find you know that song I'm going
[2:06:25] through I'll pay the price no matter
[2:06:28] what others do
[2:06:30] I'll take the way with the Lord's this
[2:06:32] past few I'm going through
[2:06:36] belief in the whole body of revealed
[2:06:39] truth remember he said one Speck of
[2:06:41] unbelief in your Mystic kingdom of God
[2:06:44] one Speck
[2:06:48] a speck is like dust like dust
[2:06:54] God help us
[2:06:57] we want
[2:06:58] to make sure that we believe the whole
[2:07:01] word of God
[2:07:03] the entire word of God because remember
[2:07:06] where you leave God that's right where
[2:07:09] Satan has access to your life through
[2:07:12] that open door that open Channel because
[2:07:14] that's where Eve opened the door
[2:07:17] and that's right where Satan entered
[2:07:22] program and perseverance
[2:07:26] he said I think each Christian ought to
[2:07:27] do that before you come out and confess
[2:07:29] the Holy Ghost
[2:07:31] confess that you have the baptism there
[2:07:33] ought to be such a personal contact with
[2:07:34] God
[2:07:35] until all the intellectuals in the world
[2:07:38] couldn't explain it from you
[2:07:41] you know you've been there you've had
[2:07:43] the witness you know it so he said
[2:07:45] that's a requirement
[2:07:49] and you know there I believe it was in
[2:07:51] the book of Acts where
[2:07:53] Stephen is talking about the children of
[2:07:55] Israel and how they came out of Egypt
[2:07:57] and Stephen says that as they came out
[2:08:00] how have they gotten to themselves A
[2:08:02] dathan and A quora but in their hearts
[2:08:05] they had turned back to Egypt
[2:08:08] they were with Moses but they're in
[2:08:11] their hearts they were back in Egypt
[2:08:14] and that's what people are doing today
[2:08:16] they're trying to get leaders for
[2:08:17] themselves to try and find false with
[2:08:19] the message
[2:08:22] and in their hearts they're back in
[2:08:23] Egypt they're back in in the world
[2:08:27] right and they're just looking
[2:08:30] this message is perfect
[2:08:33] this message is perfect
[2:08:36] you know well I can show you where
[2:08:37] Rotherham said g chapter three it
[2:08:39] doesn't matter this message is perfect
[2:08:41] because you say that by faith right
[2:08:46] there's no mistakes in the message
[2:08:48] because the message is Jesus Christ if
[2:08:51] this message was a man there'd be
[2:08:52] mistakes
[2:08:55] but this message is Jesus Christ
[2:08:59] you know people that may not understand
[2:09:00] may ask you know why do we listen to
[2:09:02] tapes
[2:09:04] why do you listen to a tape of a man
[2:09:07] that that you know passed away 50 years
[2:09:10] ago for you know 50 I'm going 50 years
[2:09:12] ago
[2:09:13] because
[2:09:15] the tapes the message
[2:09:18] is this manifested right
[2:09:22] it's like the gospels the Gospels
[2:09:25] is the works of Jesus Christ manifested
[2:09:28] right they've seen Jesus do it and they
[2:09:30] wrote it down
[2:09:31] so when you read the gospels you're
[2:09:33] reading what Jesus did how he went here
[2:09:35] and how he manifested the word
[2:09:38] so we listen to tapes
[2:09:40] because it's Jesus Christ and it doesn't
[2:09:42] get old
[2:09:43] if you hear a tape and you hear a man
[2:09:46] you've missed it right
[2:09:50] but if you hear tape and you hear Jesus
[2:09:52] Christ you've got it right
[2:09:55] because that is close
[2:09:58] laying on there
[2:10:02] when brother Dale and all these other
[2:10:03] brothers get up here and they preach the
[2:10:05] word to you
[2:10:06] they are imparting eternal life to you
[2:10:08] the question is can we receive it
[2:10:12] when we hear tape it's impartation of
[2:10:14] eternal life we read the word
[2:10:15] impartation of eternal life
[2:10:17] he's trying to get us dressed
[2:10:19] the question is are we stand still
[2:10:24] you can't dress somebody that's moving
[2:10:25] anybody that has kids knows that
[2:10:28] you know
[2:10:30] you can't dress them it's impossible you
[2:10:32] gotta chase them all over the place
[2:10:36] because remember
[2:10:37] if they would just if we just stand
[2:10:40] still then he can dress this
[2:10:44] you know be still and know that I'm gone
[2:10:47] if you have a problem and you know
[2:10:49] you're trying to wait on the Lord to do
[2:10:50] it just be still and know that he's gone
[2:10:55] because brother Ram said that Jesus
[2:10:56] keeps all of his appointments
[2:10:58] he's not late
[2:11:01] they thought he was late when Lazarus
[2:11:03] was dead for three days they thought he
[2:11:06] was late but he wasn't late
[2:11:08] because the father had already showed
[2:11:09] him
[2:11:12] he said in Christ The Mystery of God
[2:11:13] revealed the new birth is Christ
[2:11:16] is a revelation God has revealed to you
[2:11:18] this great mystery and that's a new
[2:11:20] birth
[2:11:21] you realize you're not a chicken
[2:11:24] you realize that he died for you
[2:11:27] you know he died for
[2:11:29] us but when he died for you it's a
[2:11:33] little different right
[2:11:34] now what are you going to do when you
[2:11:36] get all that group together where the
[2:11:38] Revelation is perfectly in harmony
[2:11:41] and God is expressing it through his
[2:11:44] word by the same actions the same things
[2:11:46] that he did making the word manifest oh
[2:11:48] if the church only knew its position
[2:11:50] it will one day
[2:11:52] then the Rapture will go when it knows
[2:11:55] what it is
[2:11:56] and that's what happens God is waiting
[2:11:58] on his church
[2:11:59] you know as
[2:12:01] the brothers always
[2:12:03] know and like the joke you know the
[2:12:04] brothers always wait on the sisters
[2:12:06] to get ready to get dressed to do their
[2:12:09] hair
[2:12:12] God is waiting on his wife to get ready
[2:12:14] to get dressed
[2:12:18] he's waiting on her to get dressed
[2:12:21] he's paid for the garments with his own
[2:12:23] blood Glory right
[2:12:26] right so now are we getting dressed
[2:12:30] Jude 1 3 says beloved when I gave all
[2:12:33] diligence to write unto you of the
[2:12:34] common salvation it was needful for me
[2:12:36] to write unto you and exhort you that ye
[2:12:38] should earnestly contend for the faith
[2:12:41] which was once delivered into the Saints
[2:12:45] earnestly contend right life is a
[2:12:48] struggle
[2:12:50] so to be alive you got to constantly
[2:12:52] struggle life is a struggle
[2:12:55] because God loves his church
[2:12:57] God loves his bride
[2:13:00] amen
[2:13:02] he's given her you know we read in
[2:13:03] Ezekiel 16 where God did all that stuff
[2:13:05] for her
[2:13:07] and he does the same thing for his bride
[2:13:09] he's given her all the materials she
[2:13:11] needs on Earth to get ready
[2:13:16] let's go to Song of Solomon 2.
[2:13:19] now
[2:13:22] the carnal mind the carnal approach The
[2:13:24] Song of Solomon will get you nowhere
[2:13:27] but the spiritual approach is beautiful
[2:13:40] now I just need to get over there
[2:13:46] Song of Solomon 2 as we go I want us to
[2:13:48] see
[2:13:49] because this is personal and this is how
[2:13:51] God wants it to be
[2:13:53] he said I am the rose of Sharon and the
[2:13:56] lily of valleys
[2:13:59] as the Lily among Thorns so is my love
[2:14:03] among the daughters now this is Christ
[2:14:05] making love to his church
[2:14:07] he's saying is there's a Lily that
[2:14:09] sticks out among Thorns imagine a lily
[2:14:10] among thorns that is how he said my love
[2:14:17] is among
[2:14:19] the daughters he's Colony his love you
[2:14:22] are his love
[2:14:25] as the apple tree among the Trees of the
[2:14:28] wood so is my beloved among the sons
[2:14:31] I sat down under now this is the bride
[2:14:33] talking
[2:14:34] as the apple tree among the Trees of the
[2:14:36] wood so is my beloved among the sons I
[2:14:39] sat down under his shadow with great
[2:14:42] delight and his fruit was sweet to my
[2:14:44] taste right
[2:14:46] the bride loves the word of Jesus Christ
[2:14:48] it's sweet to her taste
[2:14:52] he brought me to the banqueting house
[2:14:54] and His Banner Over Me was love
[2:14:57] His Banner was not judgment it was love
[2:14:59] glory and then we had the love like the
[2:15:02] lion the ox the vicesage of a man and
[2:15:05] the eagle
[2:15:06] all over the church in this end time all
[2:15:09] four beasts amen
[2:15:11] that well that's the banner over the
[2:15:13] church that's the Banner Over You Love
[2:15:15] stay me with flagons comfort me with
[2:15:17] apples for I am sick of love his hand is
[2:15:20] under my head and his right hand doth
[2:15:22] embrace me or charge I charge you
[2:15:24] Daughters of Jerusalem by the rose and
[2:15:26] by the hands of the field that ye stir
[2:15:28] not up nor awake my love till he please
[2:15:31] the voice of my beloved behold the
[2:15:34] cometh leaping upon the mountains
[2:15:36] skipping upon the Hills
[2:15:39] my beloved is like a row or a young
[2:15:41] heart behold he standeth behind our wall
[2:15:43] he looked forth at the windows showing
[2:15:46] himself through the lattice he's
[2:15:48] revealing himself to us he's showing
[2:15:50] himself to his love to his sweetheart my
[2:15:54] beloved spake and said unto me rise up
[2:15:57] my love my fair one and come away
[2:16:01] that's where we're living right here
[2:16:03] he's saying rise up my love
[2:16:05] come on let's go away
[2:16:09] for Lo the Winter's past the rain
[2:16:14] former letter Reign is over and gone
[2:16:18] the flowers sounds like spring doesn't
[2:16:21] it appear on the Earth
[2:16:23] the time of the singing of the birds is
[2:16:24] common the voice of the turtle it's like
[2:16:27] the turtle dove is heard in our land
[2:16:30] has he could to you through the
[2:16:32] revelation of the son of man
[2:16:35] the Fig Tree there's Israel
[2:16:38] puteth forth her green figs
[2:16:41] and the vines with the tender grape have
[2:16:43] a good smell Arise My Love My Fair one
[2:16:45] and come away
[2:16:48] the Fig Tree is putting forth her buds
[2:16:50] at that time it's time to arise come
[2:16:52] away my love let's go
[2:16:54] it's springtime
[2:16:58] oh my dove Thou Art in the clefs of The
[2:17:02] Rock
[2:17:03] isn't that so sweet
[2:17:06] in the secret places of the stairs
[2:17:09] let me see thy countenance
[2:17:12] stairs speak of access
[2:17:16] let me see that countenance let me hear
[2:17:18] thy voice for sweet is thy voice
[2:17:22] and my countenance is comely Jesus wants
[2:17:25] to hear you talk back to him
[2:17:27] he wants to hear you tell him how much
[2:17:28] you love him how much you appreciate
[2:17:29] them
[2:17:31] he said let me hear that voice
[2:17:34] for sweet is thy voice and my
[2:17:37] countenance is comely he loves how you
[2:17:39] look when you're dressed in his word
[2:17:41] right he loves it
[2:17:44] take us the foxes the little foxes that
[2:17:47] spoil the Vines for our Vines have
[2:17:48] tender grapes my beloved is mine and I
[2:17:52] am his amen he feedeth among the lilies
[2:17:57] until the day break and the Shadows flee
[2:17:59] away turn my beloved and be there like a
[2:18:00] row or a young heart upon the mountains
[2:18:02] of bether
[2:18:04] amen
[2:18:05] see how he talks to the church right
[2:18:09] he talks to the church in sweetness and
[2:18:12] in tenderness Glory
[2:18:14] he says come away my love the winners
[2:18:16] past the rains have come and gone
[2:18:19] later in 4 7 he says Thou Art all fair
[2:18:23] my love
[2:18:25] there's no spot envy
[2:18:28] you're Justified there's no spot in you
[2:18:32] Thou Art all fair my love
[2:18:35] there is no spot in thee
[2:18:40] in Psalm 17 8 keep me as the apple of
[2:18:43] the eye hide me under the shadow of thy
[2:18:46] wings
[2:18:47] this is how the Bible was meant to be
[2:18:49] read
[2:18:50] because the Bible is a love letter to
[2:18:52] the church
[2:18:54] it is a love letter to the church you
[2:18:56] say well I read about judgment about
[2:18:58] tribulation well that's not for the
[2:19:00] church
[2:19:03] that's not for the church that's for
[2:19:04] those that refuse to be dressed in the
[2:19:07] roads of his righteousness when we read
[2:19:09] of tribulation we say thank you Lord
[2:19:11] that you've saved me from that right
[2:19:15] but it's a love letter to the church
[2:19:18] and only the bride knows how to read the
[2:19:20] love letter of Jesus Christ only the
[2:19:22] Bride Can discern and little nuggets and
[2:19:24] see it in the word glory and when he
[2:19:27] leaves
[2:19:30] because remember at that day when we
[2:19:33] stand before him
[2:19:34] he only recognizes the blood of Jesus
[2:19:36] Christ
[2:19:40] nothing else
[2:19:41] so if we're not clothed it's not you're
[2:19:44] halfway clothed you're either clothed
[2:19:46] with his righteousness or you're not
[2:19:48] you're right either your clothes or your
[2:19:52] naked before him
[2:19:54] remember one Speck of unbelief
[2:19:57] keep any of us out of the kingdom of God
[2:19:59] right
[2:20:02] so my prayer is that the Lord will just
[2:20:05] help us all as a as Believers
[2:20:07] because we're all you know we're all
[2:20:09] scattered geographically in different
[2:20:11] areas
[2:20:12] but we can come together and fellowship
[2:20:14] around this word
[2:20:15] and and be encouraged and be
[2:20:18] strengthening because we have the same
[2:20:19] daddy so we can read the word and and a
[2:20:22] brother can come here from across the
[2:20:24] world
[2:20:25] not even speak our language right and
[2:20:29] you can he he can he can preach the word
[2:20:32] and impart eternal life
[2:20:34] now you know don't misunderstand me it's
[2:20:37] not a human giving eternal life to
[2:20:39] anybody he done it all right
[2:20:43] but you remember Peter said Silver and
[2:20:45] Gold Have I None but such as I have he
[2:20:48] had it in them and he was able to impart
[2:20:50] it to him
[2:20:53] such as I have I give unto you right but
[2:20:56] then he didn't say in the name of Peter
[2:20:57] rise up and walk he said as I have I
[2:20:59] give unto you but in the name of the
[2:21:01] Lord Jesus Christ rise up and walk so
[2:21:04] we're not giving you nobody can save
[2:21:06] nobody else
[2:21:08] the only only God can say Glory but we
[2:21:11] can tell you hey we can point you and
[2:21:13] say he done it for you
[2:21:15] and you know what when when that
[2:21:17] predestinary seed it clicks then you
[2:21:20] know what you're right he did he died
[2:21:22] for me and that person comes in and gets
[2:21:25] Justified and Sanctified filled with the
[2:21:26] Holy Ghost and then God used you
[2:21:29] to bring that person to him right so you
[2:21:32] imparted you disclosed to him or her
[2:21:35] eternal life
[2:21:38] and you can also do that the way you
[2:21:40] live your life you get your assaulty and
[2:21:42] you attract people and you know there's
[2:21:44] ways to draw people
[2:21:46] so God help us to be salty
[2:21:49] God help us to to be more ready for his
[2:21:52] coming this year than than last year
[2:21:56] because remember once if I don't believe
[2:21:59] that if somebody I believe that only the
[2:22:02] bride is going to see the resurrected
[2:22:03] ones
[2:22:05] you know so it's not like if you see a
[2:22:07] resurrected one you're going in the
[2:22:09] Rapture
[2:22:11] you know people in the Old Testament
[2:22:13] didn't see Abraham and Sarah and then
[2:22:16] miss it
[2:22:18] you know with Jesus when he went he took
[2:22:20] he took those that have gone on but the
[2:22:22] point I'm trying to make is that in the
[2:22:23] resurrection that will be that final you
[2:22:25] see and you know it's time
[2:22:28] you know and I believe that we may even
[2:22:31] see people that we don't really might
[2:22:33] not really you know like when we get to
[2:22:34] heaven we're not there's gonna be no
[2:22:36] introductions
[2:22:38] you won't have to be introduced to Moses
[2:22:41] because you're going to know right who
[2:22:42] he is when you see him
[2:22:46] you know and I believe that
[2:22:48] when brother Rand was Pat was caught
[2:22:50] past the curtain of time I believe he's
[2:22:52] seen arthiopanies over there you know I
[2:22:55] it's I I just believe that personally
[2:22:57] you know because he's seen it as far as
[2:22:58] he can see my precious brother because
[2:23:01] remember if we dropped this Tabernacle
[2:23:04] if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved
[2:23:06] we already have one waiting
[2:23:10] you know
[2:23:11] because he's seen millions and millions
[2:23:12] come my precious brother my precious
[2:23:14] brother remember he was still he didn't
[2:23:16] recognize him
[2:23:18] but they recognized him
[2:23:21] because he was still you know
[2:23:23] in his flesh he didn't recognize who was
[2:23:26] that woman he remembered that voice told
[2:23:28] him she was 90 years old right
[2:23:31] so that's what we're looking for is the
[2:23:33] resurrection
[2:23:35] so our job before then is to be clothed
[2:23:38] in his righteousness right Glory
[2:23:41] to be clothed in his righteousness and
[2:23:44] when we see him that'll just I believe
[2:23:45] that'll just Propel us give us that
[2:23:46] faith we need to quickness right
[2:23:49] because once that happens once God
[2:23:52] closes the door to the Gentiles there'll
[2:23:54] be no more Mercy
[2:23:57] there'll be no more getting dressed then
[2:24:00] he that's filthy will be filthy still
[2:24:02] and he that's righteous will be
[2:24:03] righteous still
[2:24:06] amen
[2:24:07] amen God bless you all tonight
[2:24:10] we appreciate y'all so much and uh you
[2:24:12] know it's a it's a privilege to really
[2:24:14] be able to stand here and praise you
[2:24:16] brothers and sisters
[2:24:18] and we love the Lord
[2:24:20] we believe the message
[2:24:22] we're just waiting on his coming right
[2:24:25] you know pray for me that I get dressed
[2:24:27] and I pray for you that you get dressed
[2:24:31] because true
[2:24:34] preaching true Ministry is when a person
[2:24:36] preaches to themselves too right
[2:24:39] you know when I if if a minister gets on
[2:24:43] someone else's toes if it's true
[2:24:46] Ministry he's getting on his own toes
[2:24:49] as well
[2:24:51] because we're all human we're all
[2:24:52] susceptible to mistakes he's only
[2:24:54] perfect one
[2:24:56] amen
[2:24:57] we love y'all tonight let's bow our
[2:24:59] heads in prayer
[2:25:02] degracious Heavenly Father Lord God in
[2:25:04] heaven we're so thankful to you Lord for

[2:25:50] don't hold us accountable for our
[2:25:52] mistakes but when we sin willfully God
[2:25:55] forbid Lord that there's anyone that
[2:25:56] would be in sin willfully Lord
[2:25:58] May each and every person know
[2:26:01] that you died for them you've made a way

[2:27:45] I believe it don't you
[2:27:48] man let's stand together and just
[2:27:51] change a little order of things and sing
[2:27:53] a little bit if anybody has a need come
[2:27:56] and just pray and believe and see God do
[2:27:58] it

[2:28:05] how much you appreciate it because we do
[2:28:07] enjoy the message enjoyed him doing them
[2:28:10] I've always
[2:28:11] love to be able to
[2:28:15] stand up behind somebody and say well I
[2:28:17] enjoyed that that's right I have stood
[2:28:19] up behind people and I said I enjoyed
[2:28:21] that
[2:28:22] but it wouldn't all that I enjoyed
[2:28:26] but I really enjoyed it tonight I
[2:28:28] enjoyed it it was a good good thing good
[2:28:31] point good way of bringing it and I
[2:28:34] think we all agree Mr the word of the
[2:28:36] Lord is the major thing
[2:28:39] it's been said about Lula you know they
[2:28:41] said we all are just word word word word
[2:28:45] well what was that statement you made
[2:28:47] about the
[2:28:48] the highest form of God
[2:28:52] is his word
[2:28:53] I like that
[2:28:56] that's the way I believe it he said no
[2:28:59] no no you've got all but you've never
[2:29:02] seen any of those other things beyond
[2:29:06] the form
[2:29:08] of the word amen
[2:29:10] you may not ever see things beyond the
[2:29:15] form
[2:29:16] of the word
[2:29:19] remember
[2:29:21] no man has seen God

[2:34:49] worshiping and things and just remember
[2:34:54] pray for the sick ones Among Us no
[2:34:57] because none of us are immune to
[2:35:01] sicknesses
[2:35:02] but we don't glory in them we glory in
[2:35:04] the Healer
[2:35:05] you know last week there I was having a
[2:35:09] pretty rough battle about it and you
[2:35:11] know having a lot of troubles and tried
[2:35:14] to deer hunt and
[2:35:15] it's aching and all like that and
[2:35:18] finally my wife check my temperature
[2:35:20] Sunday afternoon after I got back home
[2:35:22] but his actress prayed for a hearing it
[2:35:24] was 102 and four tenths and she got
[2:35:27] worried but you know didn't bother me
[2:35:30] why because I knew who the Healer was
[2:35:32] well I went to the doctor fine thank God
[2:35:36] you know
[2:35:37] but Monday night
[2:35:39] it just broke
[2:35:42] I was sitting there sweating man I was
[2:35:46] ringing wet you know
[2:35:48] I didn't need a bath all I needed was a
[2:35:50] towel
[2:35:52] I had the water you know and took care
[2:35:56] of it see because that's where it all
[2:35:58] goes he's the Healer if we believe him
[2:36:01] he said well you still coughing well
[2:36:02] you're coughing too so all right we just
[2:36:05] all have a good time coughing and forget
[2:36:06] it because the next day is your day in
[2:36:08] the barrel
[2:36:09] that's a common saying in the South
[2:36:11] right it's next for you so next time you
[2:36:14] call we'll I'll pray about you so we
[2:36:16] just have you know the time in the Lord
[2:36:18] but who will be first to come and let's
[2:36:19] do we've got about an hour and 15
[2:36:21] minutes and we can do some how some
[2:36:24] singing and everything but I'm not going
[2:36:27] to call nobody's name
[2:36:29] I'm not going to do that I'm going to
[2:36:31] just say all right if you want to sing
[2:36:33] come on if you don't don't come right
[2:36:37] later I will need the same
[2:36:41] we don't play
[2:36:43] all right so we have one to come
[2:36:48] got a bunch of them okay all righty
[2:36:52] look we got some brothers that's going
[2:36:54] to sing
[2:36:58] so come on brother the rest of you get
[2:37:00] ready because when they get through get
[2:37:02] up and come on
[2:37:06] we're going to start it off because
[2:37:07] it'll be all downhill from then on
[2:37:09] so yeah
[2:37:16] I
[2:37:19] want to give you a little background on
[2:37:21] this song because it's really special
[2:37:23] for this year
[2:37:25] being that uh
[2:37:27] brother George Canada
[2:37:29] and brother Mike Canada
[2:37:32] and brother Robert Tatum
[2:37:34] and brother
[2:37:36] Ernest moat
[2:37:38] we're riding back and forth to
[2:37:39] Jeffersonville
[2:37:41] and I don't know the whole story
[2:37:43] but they were singing the old song
[2:37:47] There's an eye watching you
[2:37:49] you know there's an eye watching you so
[2:37:52] they were singing those songs and then
[2:37:54] they got inspired to write their own
[2:37:55] verse
[2:37:56] well they they had from you know every
[2:37:59] how many hours it took them to get to
[2:38:00] Jeffersonville and back so they pinned
[2:38:03] this what we're going to sing for you
[2:38:04] but the special part of it is
[2:38:06] brother Ernest moat was one of the
[2:38:08] original pastors here at this church and
[2:38:10] he's passed on and brother Richard
[2:38:12] Marlow is his son-in-law
[2:38:14] and in another form Joe and Esther were
[2:38:17] that's the Tabernacle when they sang the
[2:38:19] song because it was their dad brother
[2:38:22] George Canada
[2:38:24] and brother Mike Canada and brother
[2:38:25] Robert Tatum and brother moat sang this
[2:38:27] song on The Sixth Seal
[2:38:30] uh when brother Brandon was preaching
[2:38:32] the seals they sang this song and it's
[2:38:34] if I were you I'd make a change so we're
[2:38:36] going to try to Bob and I was going to
[2:38:38] stand in for the other two and and the
[2:38:40] reason this is special is the last one
[2:38:42] of the group
[2:38:44] brother Mike Canada passed away
[2:38:46] just a few months ago
[2:38:49] so he's he's gone so the quartet's over
[2:38:51] there
[2:38:53] so we're going to sing it in this we're
[2:38:55] gonna sing it in the first three
[2:38:57] dimensions and they can be seeing it in
[2:38:58] the sixth Dimension my worst thing than
[2:39:00] in the first three
[2:39:01] they're probably going to do a lot
[2:39:03] better job
[2:39:04] but we're gonna try it anyway but it's
[2:39:05] called if I were you I'd make a change
[2:39:07] so they wrote These they wrote These
[2:39:09] verses
[2:39:10] and listen to them because a lot of us
[2:39:12] want brother William
[2:39:14] spoke on tonight so Lord bless your
[2:39:17] heart
[2:39:24] if I were you I'd make okay
[2:39:30] if I were you I'd make a change
[2:39:36] if I were you I
[2:39:39] could change
[2:39:43] baptized in Jesus
[2:39:47] a severe priest on the day of pentacle
[2:39:52] three thousand Souls they came and
[2:39:58] had breath and what must we do or repent
[2:40:05] and be baptized in his name
[2:40:09] if I were you I'd make a change
[2:40:15] if I were you right
[2:40:18] between
[2:40:21] if I were you I'd make a change
[2:40:27] baptized in Jesus name
[2:40:36] that's right
[2:40:45] Jesus be baptized if you have to be
[2:40:51] baptized again
[2:40:54] if I were you I'd make a change
[2:40:59] if I
[2:41:02] make a change
[2:41:05] if I were you I'd make a change and I'd
[2:41:11] be
[2:41:12] baptized in Jesus name spoke on this a
[2:41:16] minute ago Paul finding certain
[2:41:18] disciples
[2:41:21] they were Brethren that had just begun
[2:41:28] how then were you baptized they said we
[2:41:33] were baptized unto John but Paul told
[2:41:37] them
[2:41:38] if I were you I'd make a change
[2:41:42] thank you if I were you I
[2:41:46] change
[2:41:55] baptized in Jesus name
[2:42:10] that I'm watching you watching you
[2:42:13] you'll have trouble at the
[2:42:16] light there were no games
[2:42:23] you could change
[2:42:27] if I were you I'd make a change
[2:42:32] if I were you let me change
[2:42:37] if I were you
[2:42:41] you might make a change
[2:42:45] baptizing Jesus name

[2:43:43] praise the Lord enjoyed that that was
[2:43:45] good
[2:43:46] we'd have to practice but one time you
[2:43:48] know that was pretty tough if you want
[2:43:49] to Jim come up here and we'll get ours
[2:43:51] finished and then uh because I gotta run
[2:43:52] the sound system and but you know it

[2:48:10] couple of years ago and
[2:48:12] so every once in a while we sing it as a
[2:48:14] family in the van or wherever we travel
[2:48:16] and so
[2:48:18] it's just we're going to say in the
[2:48:20] course three times if you don't know we
[2:48:22] can just sing it here but if you know it
[2:48:24] just join in it's more just a praise and
[2:48:26] worship but just listen to the words
[2:48:28] cause it uh speaks of of the of the
[2:48:32] blood of Jesus Christ that covers us
[2:48:34] from our sin and knowing that is the
[2:48:37] token that we have in this age that
[2:48:40] we're walking in the newness of life in
[2:48:42] the life of Jesus Christ
[2:48:46] I'm done

[3:15:03] I'm very grateful to God for all he's
[3:15:05] done for us
[3:15:06] and even growing spiritually that's the
[3:15:09] main thing and I'm very grateful for
[3:15:11] that God opens his word to me every day
[3:15:14] and I'm very very grateful for that
[3:15:17] so

[3:18:58] about the wars and earthquakes and the
[3:19:02] fig tree that he leaves but there is a

[3:35:43] foreign
[3:35:50] got everything ready
[3:35:52] okay ready to go
[3:35:58] that was sitting back there just
[3:35:59] thinking a little bit
[3:36:02] that's probably my problem but
[3:36:05] you know I wanted to share this first I
[3:36:06] want Sterling to hear this
[3:36:08] I got a call the other day that my
[3:36:11] sister was coming back to visit on
[3:36:13] January 5th
[3:36:14] and uh for you all that don't know this
[3:36:17] my mother and my sister came down when
[3:36:18] Sterling was born
[3:36:20] and they stayed with us 12 years until
[3:36:22] my mother passed but my mother came on
[3:36:25] oxygen
[3:36:27] not knowing anything about this work
[3:36:30] she was delivered for
[3:36:32] eight years
[3:36:33] or she passed
[3:36:36] then my dad came one time
[3:36:39] and he was of the world pretty much and
[3:36:42] quite a character
[3:36:44] and from Florida and he had all these
[3:36:46] Flaherty shirts on and he big old gold
[3:36:48] piece hanging around probably all he had
[3:36:51] right there awning that you wouldn't
[3:36:53] have thought so but he was sitting in
[3:36:56] service here one day
[3:36:58] and uh
[3:37:00] had sunglasses on
[3:37:02] and brother dick says I'm going to pray
[3:37:05] for my brother here that has a problem
[3:37:07] with his eyes
[3:37:10] but the funny thing about the whole
[3:37:12] story was I've been trying to get him to
[3:37:13] come he would come and visit every
[3:37:16] summer and he actually put a place I've
[3:37:18] got a big Campground in my house in the
[3:37:20] woods if you want to come Camp sometime
[3:37:22] with two motorhomes or whatever but he
[3:37:26] came
[3:37:27] and uh
[3:37:29] I tried to get him come he said I'm not
[3:37:30] I won't come he said because all they
[3:37:32] want to do is talk about tithing
[3:37:36] and I've been going here 10 12 years I
[3:37:39] guess
[3:37:40] and I said my pastor's never preached on
[3:37:42] tithing
[3:37:44] well you know what happens
[3:37:46] he comes in and he sits down and
[3:37:50] he the Lord just spoke to him
[3:37:54] so we go out in the car after service
[3:37:56] and he has his sunglasses on
[3:37:59] and he sat back here and he says
[3:38:02] Lane's over the seat put his glasses
[3:38:04] down he says for somebody it never talks
[3:38:07] about preaching on tithe and he sure
[3:38:09] knows what he's talking about
[3:38:12] so
[3:38:14] and I'm saying this dude
[3:38:16] one more thing because I've had my my
[3:38:19] sister my mother my father come through
[3:38:21] here
[3:38:23] and I'm praying for my brother
[3:38:26] pray for him for sure but I hope that
[3:38:29] he'll come sometime
[3:38:32] but mermaid's coming back and I don't
[3:38:33] know if you don't know this but she lost
[3:38:36] her leg from the knee down
[3:38:39] in the last year and a half
[3:38:42] and I believe we're in the day that the
[3:38:44] limbs could be restored
[3:38:46] I just I met that brother in
[3:38:48] Jeffersonville and we went up there that
[3:38:50] was had his arm restored
[3:38:53] and there's a lot of things that happen
[3:38:55] on that trip
[3:38:56] but I'm just saying this to say my God
[3:38:58] is real
[3:38:59] amen and uh
[3:39:01] I just thank for the opportunity I've
[3:39:04] been blessed this year with we have had

[3:39:09] teenage group
[3:39:12] and there's many many as one Paul
[3:39:15] and I just thank the Lord that we're for
[3:39:17] the Youth that's coming through
[3:39:19] and you pray for them
[3:39:21] but I say all this
[3:39:24] to encourage Sterling
[3:39:28] to be the example of a spirit
[3:39:32] we probably have 20 boards at our house
[3:39:37] maybe every other Friday night or so
[3:39:40] but they're at our house
[3:39:43] I'm just thankful for that amen

[3:47:13] and Paul and Silas stepped outside

[3:48:01] before Goliath needed stay he took no
[3:48:06] armor he took no weapons just five
[3:48:11] stones and a string in his head as he
[3:48:15] went running to meet that Army he met
[3:48:20] that Philistine man that stood Mighty

[3:52:09] the Lord is good isn't he
[3:52:12] I'm looking forward to this year
[3:52:15] more than any time I've ever looked
[3:52:21] because
[3:52:25] brother heard Carol said
[3:52:28] there's one man said something to him
[3:52:30] one day he said
[3:52:32] you're looking forward to the coming of
[3:52:34] the Lord he said I think now he said he
[3:52:37] was 80 but he said at my age one way or
[3:52:40] the other
[3:52:43] he said because he's either coming
[3:52:47] or I'm going
[3:52:50] and he said at my age it don't make much
[3:52:52] difference
[3:52:53] so that's pretty good way of being about
[3:52:55] it didn't it
[3:52:57] just put it to the place of where you
[3:52:59] say well okay
[3:53:01] you know we're down here at the end of
[3:53:03] all things of this year
[3:53:06] and we always don't write no predictions
[3:53:09] no
[3:53:10] doings
[3:53:12] I look forward every day
[3:53:14] I like what Billy Graham said one time
[3:53:16] he said if he doesn't come this morning
[3:53:19] I want to wake up in the morning looking
[3:53:22] for him
[3:53:24] and I thought well if he could say that
[3:53:25] then I can say it surely you know I'm
[3:53:28] looking forward to his coming
[3:53:31] but I met at the same time experiencing
[3:53:34] that coming
[3:53:36] I believe the Rapture started
[3:53:39] the day you received the new birth is
[3:53:42] our brother talking about and you know
[3:53:44] that started on the day of Pentecost
[3:53:47] 2 000 years ago and everybody's been
[3:53:50] looking for a Rapture in the Rapture is
[3:53:53] in place inside of you because what's
[3:53:55] going to take you there is inside
[3:53:58] all right we just need to get the
[3:54:00] mechanics
[3:54:02] quickened into Dynamics to word that it
[3:54:06] can make the body work
[3:54:10] just as you put the gas in the tank does
[3:54:13] no good you put a spark
[3:54:15] see we're in that time now of all things
[3:54:18] and we really we appreciate it
[3:54:20] appreciate the Lord giving us this time
[3:54:23] to where we could serve him and you know
[3:54:26] what you say well why are we here
[3:54:28] that's the reason we're here
[3:54:31] it's because you said it why are we here
[3:54:37] right
[3:54:39] people say you know in the Bible
[3:54:40] remember we're talking about money he
[3:54:42] said they'll say well you know since the
[3:54:44] father they went to sleep and oh we've
[3:54:46] heard these things
[3:54:48] well you know what that was exactly
[3:54:52] the scriptures
[3:54:55] that were showing where they were living
[3:54:58] when you question God
[3:55:01] remember
[3:55:04] you're the problem
[3:55:06] so then why not look for him every day
[3:55:08] and don't worry about it and say thank
[3:55:09] you and just be happy
[3:55:13] and rejoice and say thank you Lord for
[3:55:16] what I have heard
[3:55:18] when I've been allowed to be a part of
[3:55:22] and to Feast upon your word and you
[3:55:26] could teach us something
[3:55:28] what a wonderful thing
[3:55:31] as we enter into this time of the new
[3:55:34] year we always try to take the communion
[3:55:36] while they're out there
[3:55:39] Holland screaming and shouting and
[3:55:41] praising their God
[3:55:44] we just take a little quiet time and
[3:55:46] take the communion and just Fellowship
[3:55:49] together because like our brother said
[3:55:50] see communion is to Fellowship it takes
[3:55:54] two people to commune
[3:55:56] you know you you can't do by yourself
[3:55:59] so the communion then is to and brother
[3:56:02] Brown says that we we do too much now
[3:56:05] listen the way he says it 'll say one
[3:56:08] time you don't pray enough next time you
[3:56:09] say you pray too much
[3:56:12] when I listen what he's saying
[3:56:15] he says because a lot of times we do all
[3:56:18] the talking
[3:56:21] and he says prior mine were to be that
[3:56:24] we
[3:56:26] shut up
[3:56:28] listen to him
[3:56:31] let him do the talking
[3:56:34] save us a lot more trouble than we think
[3:56:37] you know doing it but we appreciate
[3:56:38] everything it's been said and done
[3:56:40] appreciate the message our brothers
[3:56:42] brought to us today we appreciate all of
[3:56:45] the singing the things and and I always
[3:56:48] just appreciate God
[3:56:50] for being who he is he's still the
[3:56:53] Healer he's still the deliverer
[3:56:55] and I believe we'll see a whole lot more
[3:56:56] this year of things because I always
[3:56:59] look at that
[3:57:01] I'm never satisfied one day it you know
[3:57:04] we take one day at a time but I'm never
[3:57:06] satisfied to just be well you know okay
[3:57:09] we're in the message Glory Hallelujah
[3:57:12] no
[3:57:15] I don't believe that's what turned the
[3:57:17] world up in the days of Martin Luther
[3:57:19] turned it upside down
[3:57:21] when that man saw the judge she'll live
[3:57:23] by faith
[3:57:25] Catholic Church
[3:57:27] didn't get upset at him about saying
[3:57:29] that
[3:57:32] he was just one man
[3:57:35] but when the people begin to say it
[3:57:38] right
[3:57:39] they got concerned
[3:57:42] the world's not concerned about us
[3:57:43] passing out dates and books and tracks
[3:57:47] talking about William Branham as a
[3:57:49] prophet and thing
[3:57:50] but when the people begin to live the
[3:57:52] message the man brought
[3:57:56] then the world get upset
[3:58:00] the prophet said when a move becomes
[3:58:02] among the bride
[3:58:04] them denominations will swing together
[3:58:10] oh we're looking out there for all to
[3:58:12] start well all right let's get something
[3:58:15] not manufactured
[3:58:17] let's just get it to going
[3:58:20] did he say it this way he said when the
[3:58:22] bride realizes who she is
[3:58:25] she'll be an invincible Army
[3:58:29] well I just don't see that well that's
[3:58:33] the people that's that's the cause
[3:58:34] that's the trouble
[3:58:37] is the people not seeing it
[3:58:40] so we could at least start saying it
[3:58:42] right
[3:58:43] just let's think about the scriptures
[3:58:47] because now remember
[3:58:50] what about the great
[3:58:53] men that were there with the Lord Jesus
[3:58:59] all around him and everything
[3:59:04] they were there when he instituted the
[3:59:07] communion
[3:59:09] in the upper room
[3:59:11] but not one of them was ever asked to
[3:59:15] explain it
[3:59:17] neither one of them ever put into words
[3:59:21] oh yeah
[3:59:22] you have this talking about you got the
[3:59:25] writings Matthew Martin Luke and John
[3:59:26] but now get on over and John later he's
[3:59:28] writing he didn't mention the communion
[3:59:30] what about the great Apostle Paul who
[3:59:33] was born
[3:59:35] out of new season
[3:59:39] but yet he was asked to explain
[3:59:42] the communion
[3:59:45] and he wasn't even there
[3:59:47] when it was instituted
[3:59:50] but he could go back in that Old
[3:59:52] Testament and pull that word out and
[3:59:53] bring it down
[3:59:55] you know
[3:59:57] and we found out way done a marvelous
[3:59:59] job one time bringing it out so you go
[4:00:01] back there and they would leave a table
[4:00:02] they'd leave a place they'd leave things
[4:00:05] and they had to bread to communion in
[4:00:08] that thing
[4:00:09] they didn't know what it was all about
[4:00:12] they didn't understand what they were
[4:00:14] doing
[4:00:15] and Jesus just picks it up and said here
[4:00:18] let me explain this
[4:00:20] this is what you should have been doing
[4:00:23] all alone
[4:00:24] it was there in the word let's read the
[4:00:27] scripture pray go into the communion
[4:00:30] and thank the Lord for the word
[4:00:33] for I have received of the Lord that
[4:00:35] which also I delivered unto you that the
[4:00:37] Lord Jesus the same night in which he
[4:00:39] was betrayed took bread
[4:00:42] and when he had given thanks he break it
[4:00:44] and said take you this is my body which
[4:00:46] is broken for you this due in
[4:00:47] remembrance of me
[4:00:49] after the same manner also he took the
[4:00:51] cup when he had stopped saying this cup
[4:00:53] is the New Testament in my blood this
[4:00:56] due years after you drink it in
[4:00:58] remembrance of me for as often as you
[4:01:01] eat this bread and drink this cup you
[4:01:02] Deuce you the Lord's death till he come
[4:01:05] or for whosoever shall eat this bread
[4:01:07] and drink this cup of the Lord
[4:01:08] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[4:01:11] and blood of the Lord
[4:01:13] but let a man examine himself and sold
[4:01:15] any meat of that bread and drink of that
[4:01:17] cup he didn't eat it and drinketh
[4:01:19] unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation
[4:01:21] to himself not Discerning the Lord's
[4:01:24] body
[4:01:24] for this cause many are weak and sickly
[4:01:26] among you and many sleep for we would
[4:01:29] judge ourselves we should not be judged
[4:01:32] I love this part
[4:01:34] but when we are judged
[4:01:40] what does he do
[4:01:43] rotation to the Lord
[4:01:45] why that we should not be condemned with
[4:01:48] the world or for my brethren when you
[4:01:50] come together to eat Terry one for
[4:01:52] another and if any man hunger let him
[4:01:54] eat at home
[4:01:56] that you come not under condemnation and
[4:01:58] the rest will I said in order
[4:02:00] when I come
[4:02:02] let's just take a few moments and just
[4:02:04] have a
[4:02:05] solid prayer and
[4:02:07] praying one for the others that the Lord
[4:02:09] would be with us this year and guide us
[4:02:11] and take care of us and pray for you
[4:02:13] Pastor and pray for the people and all
[4:02:16] that we may all be one together in him
[4:02:34] father we thank you for this day and we
[4:02:36] thank you for the hour that we've had
[4:02:38] the times we've had tonight Lord it
[4:02:40] ended a year and we start a new
[4:02:44] thank you for the word that we ended up
[4:02:46] on
[4:02:47] and knowing that what we ended up on is
[4:02:49] what we start on
[4:02:51] because it becomes former and latter
[4:02:53] in it we just walked right out onto the
[4:02:57] word of the day and the time because we
[4:03:00] have that word promised unto us
[4:03:02] throughout the message
[4:03:03] we need to recognize our day and it's
[4:03:06] time
[4:03:07] forgive our sins and lead us by thine
[4:03:09] understanding that we may walk in the
[4:03:11] light of your loving grace
[4:03:13] teach us to wait upon you Lord
[4:03:16] in Jesus name
[4:03:19] amen
[4:03:21] the Bible said he took bread and blessed
[4:03:23] it
[4:03:24] Lord Jesus we thank you for this bread
[4:03:26] has been made for this purpose tonight
[4:03:29] and for this purpose only was it
[4:03:31] designed if we might be able to break it
[4:03:35] and think about you
[4:03:37] we know it's not the bloody
[4:03:39] we know that it represents your body
[4:03:43] you think too far we know it's not the
[4:03:45] word
[4:03:46] that is represents the word
[4:03:48] then if we take it is it in
[4:03:50] representation but a representation in
[4:03:52] you is greater than a reality to any of
[4:03:54] us
[4:03:55] we love you and we thank you we ask you
[4:03:58] to sanctify this bread and the partakers
[4:04:00] in Jesus name
[4:04:13] you know we make the bread certainly for
[4:04:16] certain ways
[4:04:18] for blue wings
[4:04:21] we
[4:04:23] do all of the things the best we can do
[4:04:25] according to
[4:04:28] what we believe the word says and
[4:04:31] to do with
[4:04:33] it's not designed to be a tomorrow or
[4:04:36] the next day
[4:04:38] we burned up what's left tonight would
[4:04:40] be burned
[4:04:43] we're in another day but we're not
[4:04:45] looking for a holdover
[4:04:47] we're looking for a reality
[4:04:51] knowing that crashed
[4:04:54] is our life
[4:04:56] and we're just
[4:04:59] relaxing in him before that he can be
[4:05:03] whatever is needed
[4:05:05] for us this day
[4:05:08] we thank the Lord for
[4:05:10] the examples that we used to be and we
[4:05:13] used to take them you know
[4:05:15] we've done the best we could do but we'd
[4:05:17] make little
[4:05:20] Wafers and do kind of things and try to
[4:05:22] take grape juice and do all kind of
[4:05:25] things to
[4:05:26] but one note we found out what the truth
[4:05:29] is
[4:05:30] now we believe it
[4:05:32] father we thank you for this wine this
[4:05:34] went through the process here and as
[4:05:36] it's going through that process of aging
[4:05:38] and it's come to the basis to represent
[4:05:41] your blood
[4:05:42] which was shed for each one of us
[4:05:45] we know it's not the blood but we know
[4:05:47] it represents it but we know what this
[4:05:49] will be and we'll eat a little piece of
[4:05:51] bread and we'll drink a little sip of
[4:05:53] wine and tomorrow
[4:05:55] this will create blood cells in our body
[4:05:57] that we may physically live thereby
[4:06:01] we just if we could realize that then
[4:06:03] Lord how much more do we realize the
[4:06:05] spiritual condition
[4:06:07] of what's taking place sanctify the wine
[4:06:10] under partakers
[4:06:24] come morning
[4:06:27] I want
[4:06:30] by the river

[4:06:56] for me
[4:06:59] sometimes I'm despised
[4:07:03] and rejected

[4:07:17] more

[4:07:28] why do you sing while you're taking the
[4:07:30] communion well they used to sing when
[4:07:32] they entered the temple
[4:07:34] they used to sing when they'd go through
[4:07:35] this ritual or that one of the things
[4:07:38] they were always singing
[4:07:40] I wrote in my Bible where the the three
[4:07:43] great songs that they sing as they enter
[4:07:46] into the outer courts and inner courts
[4:07:49] and go in you know when the things we're
[4:07:52] doing and they're singing isn't that
[4:07:54] wonderful
[4:07:56] well see that's what we're doing and now
[4:07:58] you're just singing unto him
[4:08:01] come morning
[4:08:04] I want
