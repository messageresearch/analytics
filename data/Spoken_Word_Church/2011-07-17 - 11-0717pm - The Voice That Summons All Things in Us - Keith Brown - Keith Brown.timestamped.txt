[29:18] well I was on the mountain
[29:21] s
[29:58] foreign
[31:20] foreign
[32:26] foreign
[33:24] and unless you do come forth
[33:28] you're not going to be in his presence
[33:30] that's right amen so this afternoon if
[33:33] we would take our Bibles the Lord bless
[33:36] you this afternoon and we turn to Saint
[33:39] John chapter 11 once again
[33:44] praise Dear God
[33:47] and we would just like to maybe read uh
[33:50] verse 43 if we could
[33:55] and also we would turn to Titus Chapter
[33:58] 3 Verse 5 if we would
[34:03] and we just want to continue on in our
[34:07] line of thinking that we uh were
[34:10] ministering this morning amen and we
[34:13] want to go a little bit deeper into this
[34:15] resurrection
[34:17] and uh really pray that the Lord will
[34:20] bring these things out to a reality to
[34:23] you right amen it says
[34:26] and when he had this spoken he cried
[34:31] and he that was dead came forth bound
[34:35] hand and foot with great clothes and his
[34:38] face was bound about with a napkin and
[34:41] Jesus said unto them loose him and let
[34:44] him go and then Titus if we were just
[34:49] chapter 3 so that you would see the line
[34:52] of direction of thinking that I'm going
[34:54] verse 5 says not by works of
[34:56] righteousness which we have done but
[34:59] according to his Mercy he saved us by
[35:03] the washing of regeneration and and
[35:06] renewing of the Holy Ghost which he
[35:10] shared on us abundantly through Jesus
[35:12] Christ Our Savior that being justified
[35:15] by his grace we should be made heirs
[35:19] according to the hope of Eternal
[35:23] exactly amen what a promise that we have
[35:25] right amen amen let us come to that
[35:27] place where we do come forth Heavenly
[35:29] Father Lord we ask you to bless the
[35:32] reading of the word this day Lord God
[35:34] and Father just moved thy servant out of
[35:37] the way excuse them Lord Jesus
[35:40] father let us reach down to the needs of
[35:42] the assembly father God let the Holy
[35:44] Spirit speak to each heart your lord God
[35:47] as you did in Lazarus in the condition
[35:49] that he was in Lord father bless us now
[35:52] we pray in Jesus name amen praise God
[35:55] Amen God unless you said you may be
[35:57] seated the Lord's bless you and I
[35:59] am
[36:00] now we're speaking of Lazarus being
[36:04] called from the dead
[36:06] and we're seeing that it's not just any
[36:08] voice but it is The Voice
[36:11] of the resurrection and the prophet of
[36:14] God said this voice is the voice of
[36:17] Christ
[36:19] and that's very important to realize
[36:21] because we have to understand that
[36:23] Christ is the anointed one Christ is the
[36:26] one Hallelujah that when he came to
[36:29] Lazarus he spoke not just to a man this
[36:32] is what I'm really trying to get you to
[36:34] see he wasn't just speaking to a man
[36:37] because this voice
[36:39] is the voice that transcends dimensions
[36:44] because when when he called Lazarus
[36:47] Lazarus was not in that tomb right
[36:51] Lazarus was on a four-day Journey but
[36:54] that body was laying down there and it
[36:57] was in a rotten condition where
[37:00] everybody knew it's over right everybody
[37:03] knew there's no more hope right but all
[37:06] my saints of God that is the voice that
[37:09] speaks
[37:10] to them amen hallelujah that is the
[37:13] voice that those that are dead right
[37:15] praise God and here he was in the four
[37:18] Nature's brother random says we don't
[37:20] know where he went
[37:21] right
[37:22] we're in the Lord now we've been in the
[37:24] scripture and the understanding that we
[37:26] know we know that those that died before
[37:28] the blood went to paradise and he was on
[37:30] a four-day Journey right yep and I don't
[37:32] know if he was four days in Paradise but
[37:34] he was on a journey and I mean he had
[37:37] already came to this place and
[37:41] here was The Voice
[37:43] that was on this earth right he was a
[37:46] man in that dimension
[37:49] and that voice he had to hear that voice
[37:53] right amen that voice had to be heard in
[37:57] order for Lazarus to come back and come
[38:00] into that body and there'd be a
[38:02] resurrection and that body would come
[38:04] forth and stand upon the Earth all
[38:07] saints of God we have to realize what
[38:10] this voice is doing it's not just
[38:13] calling us but it's calling us to a
[38:16] condition it's a condition that the word
[38:19] sees we must be in right right he wasn't
[38:22] just calling to a man but he was
[38:25] speaking to a condition right he was
[38:28] speaking to a rotten corruption where
[38:31] let me tell you something everything
[38:33] about Lazarus in that body had died
[38:37] even is your his germ of life
[38:41] yeah
[38:43] now think about that
[38:45] we're talking about a great Resurrection
[38:46] right
[38:48] even lazarus's germ of life
[38:51] where his children would come forth from
[38:55] was dead
[38:57] but when he came forth he come forth
[39:00] with all his faculties
[39:05] God don't come into your life and
[39:07] halfway packs you up he's going to break
[39:10] the limits into your life he's going to
[39:13] set you free he's going to listen you my
[39:15] brother and sister that you can live the
[39:18] life of a resurrection you can live what
[39:21] is the life of a resurrected person
[39:22] right it's a person that can overcome
[39:25] all things
[39:27] Jesus lived that life he can overcome
[39:30] himself a resurrected life is a life
[39:33] that knows no obstacles
[39:35] come on Church Christ himself we find
[39:39] out that he could walk through the wall
[39:41] he can do all these things right but he
[39:44] comes to that place
[39:46] his body had come to the place now to
[39:49] where he could travel as a thought
[39:51] before he was locked in this male flesh
[39:55] and he had to come in flesh
[39:58] because the blood had to be shared right
[40:01] amen for a reason amen that's right and
[40:04] what that reason was is it was his blood
[40:08] come on that washed you
[40:11] it was his blood right that the prophet
[40:15] of God says that loose
[40:19] that the word wash actually means to be
[40:22] loose
[40:25] amen do we see what his blood is doing
[40:28] for us amen church that's why it has to
[40:33] be put
[40:34] under the blood right to be made right
[40:38] are you with me see it has to be done
[40:41] you say oh well I'm going to trust in
[40:43] the blood covering most of us don't even
[40:45] understand what the blood covering
[40:46] really is right
[40:47] right my brother Brandon says it is to
[40:50] be made
[40:52] see that batch of blood covering because
[40:55] here is the token not just the blood but
[41:00] the life that's in the blood is that
[41:02] right apparently and what is that that
[41:04] is the word that speaks to you right
[41:06] that is the voice that speaks from the
[41:09] blood right the life of the blood and
[41:13] that life is telling you get right live
[41:16] right right do this do that come forth
[41:19] right right amen right
[41:22] and I'll ask you this day
[41:24] what does that voice say leave right now
[41:28] the voice is telling you to come forth
[41:30] and you say but I can't yeah
[41:33] then you don't believe in the vision
[41:35] right
[41:36] right that Jesus sold you right
[41:39] because see that's what Lazarus was
[41:41] coming forth too
[41:43] he was coming forth with the
[41:45] understanding of what Jesus saw of him
[41:48] amen hallelujah amen Church don't let
[41:52] the devil deny you
[41:54] don't let nothing of this world deny you
[41:59] because that promise is yours amen amen
[42:02] praise be to God now you think about
[42:04] that that was a man four days
[42:07] rotten corrupt
[42:10] but then one day he stood back on the
[42:12] earth yeah and I don't know maybe he
[42:14] could have had children
[42:16] and maybe one day they were all sitting
[42:18] together and his kids could say you know
[42:19] death
[42:20] I was there yeah sure I was there yeah
[42:24] I was in that same condition and that
[42:27] voice called and you came forth oh come
[42:30] on Church
[42:31] Hallelujah see God will not just
[42:34] resurrect you just to bring you to a
[42:37] halfway State that's right amen but if
[42:39] you notice Lazarus
[42:41] came forward watch what the Bible said
[42:44] it said and he that was dead
[42:47] not his dead right right exactly it's
[42:50] like is that it was dead man he that's
[42:53] already been in that condition I'm now
[42:56] calling him to another condition and
[42:59] it's only one boy one voice my brother
[43:00] and sister and that's the thought this
[43:02] evening I'd like to speak you of is the
[43:05] voice that summons all things in US amen
[43:09] there is a voice that's calling today
[43:11] and that voice is calling you to a place
[43:13] it's calling you more than just being
[43:16] that Churchman right just being a part
[43:18] of a church amen but it's warning you to
[43:20] live a resurrected life amen hallelujah
[43:23] warning you to be an overcomer
[43:26] mourning you to be able to overcome any
[43:29] obstacle that the devil throws at you
[43:30] would you like to be able to live that
[43:32] life
[43:33] Hallelujah to be able to live that
[43:35] resurrected life
[43:37] what we're supposed to be living right
[43:39] now come on church that's right he
[43:44] called Lazarus
[43:46] and he that was dead
[43:50] came forth
[43:53] bam
[43:55] ham and foot
[43:59] with
[44:00] gray clothes right exactly and his face
[44:05] was bound about
[44:07] with an applicant
[44:10] he was in a condition come on he
[44:13] couldn't even help himself right nope
[44:15] that's all right come on Saints right
[44:17] see that's our trouble we always get to
[44:19] a place where we think we can handle
[44:21] yeah and as long as you've got your
[44:24] hands on it you're gonna make a mess out
[44:26] of it
[44:27] exactly amen oh my God you got to come
[44:31] to the place where you willing to let go
[44:32] of that thing amen you say but I got a
[44:35] son and daughter and I've been praying
[44:36] and I've been crying and I've been
[44:38] travailing and I've been coming to the
[44:40] Altar and I want him to come to Christ
[44:42] do you realize that you have a token
[44:44] yeah right now here's the question you
[44:46] have confidence
[44:51] you know what happens to a lot of people
[44:53] in this message
[44:55] the token will become a weakness to them
[44:57] because they want to see the child's
[45:01] salvation but it might not be meant for
[45:03] you to see the child's salvation but it
[45:06] is meant for you to believe for that
[45:08] child's salvation because if you apply
[45:11] that token and you go in the grave and
[45:14] that voice that summons all things
[45:16] Hallelujah when you resurrect they will
[45:19] be there if that token was applied right
[45:22] exactly but don't let that token become
[45:25] a weakness to you to where you're oh my
[45:27] I just got to I didn't know the token
[45:29] will bring peace it will bring strength
[45:31] in your heart amen it will cause you to
[45:34] rest right right see the devil knows how
[45:38] to make you worry oh yeah
[45:42] absolutely mother Brown says worries can
[45:46] bring kids
[45:51] you can get so worried about something
[45:54] you can have uh spiritual immunity right
[45:57] right man you can get caught between two
[45:59] opinions one brother says this pastor
[46:01] says this one this one says that and you
[46:03] get caught between two opinions and
[46:05] you're caught in a state of spiritual
[46:07] Amnesia right
[46:09] Hallelujah
[46:10] but there is
[46:14] that will summon you
[46:16] to your place where God has called you
[46:20] to be nobody can breathe your wife can't
[46:24] bring you them your husband can't bring
[46:26] you right you can't bring your children
[46:28] to that place
[46:31] you can believe for it you can claim it
[46:34] you can hold on to it had him right said
[46:38] that's the truth brother Branham and she
[46:42] held on she
[46:43] no salvation we're fixing to come to
[46:45] those two boys she didn't realize what
[46:48] was fixing to happen right but oh my
[46:50] there she was in the corner yeah you
[46:53] know I don't think much of us can humble
[46:54] ourselves to come to the corner yeah
[46:56] right
[46:57] but you know what God can see your
[46:59] problem in the corner oh yeah just as
[47:01] well as he can see you right here amen
[47:03] but oh she said there and all of a
[47:06] sudden
[47:07] said the right word right Amanda
[47:10] yep
[47:13] and brother Branham said
[47:15] I give you your children yes I give you
[47:19] these boys in the name of Jesus Christ
[47:24] now think about that science
[47:26] that was the third of the third pull the
[47:29] first time it was used on a human being
[47:31] Brothers right
[47:33] now here's the key
[47:35] anytime God does something first time
[47:41] it changed that's right yeah exactly
[47:46] just as much
[47:48] Birthright right right to claim your
[47:52] love amen amen that's right it's yours
[47:55] that's right because God don't change
[47:57] his mind about his word all right see
[48:01] God can't change his mind about his word
[48:03] but God gave us something that's
[48:04] wonderful
[48:05] he gave us a mind that can change amen
[48:08] we can't repent
[48:10] right we can forgive right but God can't
[48:13] God he
[48:15] he can't change his mind
[48:17] his mind can't be changed right because
[48:20] if he changed his mind he would be no
[48:22] more different than us right right see
[48:24] that's what I love about God his first
[48:26] thought was eternal right amen why
[48:28] wouldn't you thought of me
[48:31] he said that'll do
[48:33] it's all to you
[48:35] right
[48:36] he didn't have to think again
[48:39] and then think again well I don't know
[48:41] red hair let's try it with black hair he
[48:45] loves you the first time my brother and
[48:47] sister his first thought of you is
[48:49] eternal amen see that's why you have a
[48:52] right to claim your loved ones you have
[48:55] a right to call forth yes
[48:58] the voice of Christ
[49:01] is in you right the voice of the
[49:05] Resurrection is living in you today
[49:12] and believe it
[49:13] believe it Glory see the stone has to be
[49:15] rolled back that means you got to
[49:17] believe it you got to accept it all
[49:19] right amen
[49:20] so he called Lazarus for
[49:25] and Lazarus Lazarus came forth
[49:29] Bale
[49:32] Thai right
[49:34] napkin on his head yeah rat in Great
[49:38] Clips oh Hallelujah I think we're
[49:40] getting a picture here isn't it well man
[49:42] just think about that there was just a
[49:45] few moments there was corruption there
[49:48] was built
[49:52] mortified
[49:55] his body had mortified
[50:01] but that didn't stop the boys
[50:05] he said well I don't know if God can do
[50:08] this
[50:10] then you don't believe God
[50:13] I serve a God that can do anything amen
[50:16] amen you're looking at a man right now
[50:18] brothers and sisters that had a four-way
[50:21] bypass in an open heart surgery
[50:25] and God touched me in a miraculous way
[50:30] a four-way bypass open heart surgery
[50:33] I'm 53 years old
[50:36] and my doctor tells me my heart means
[50:39] like I'm 18 years old
[50:43] I said yeah but I've got 50 something
[50:45] year old Parts doc
[50:49] but I got this heart inside of me that
[50:51] man I mean once it starts
[50:53] and getting going
[50:57] there may be a lot of young men in here
[50:58] and you might be able to outplay me a
[51:01] basketball you might be able to outrun
[51:03] me in football you might be able to but
[51:04] you can't outwork me yeah
[51:08] I can guarantee that
[51:10] because once my heart gets kicked in I
[51:12] can work 10 12 hours straight I could
[51:15] come home I can take a shower and I'm up
[51:18] to three or four o'clock in the morning
[51:21] because there's something about when you
[51:23] get a new blood flow that's flowing
[51:25] through your body it does something
[51:27] different and my brother and sister if
[51:29] you've got a new blood flowing to you if
[51:32] that word of Christ is flowing through
[51:34] you then it's done something wonderful
[51:36] just washed you
[51:39] and that word wash leaves them in loose
[51:41] all right amen and he said that same
[51:44] word that Jesus used
[51:47] is the same word he used when he rose
[51:50] Lazarus from the ground
[51:53] now I want to show something to you here
[51:55] I want to share this with you and uh
[52:01] but why would you uh help me here maybe
[52:04] I could get you to help me here you'll
[52:06] be my demonstration here are you uh just
[52:10] remember I don't you don't you won't be
[52:12] killed for this okay so yes but I want
[52:15] to show you I want to show you this I
[52:18] told you I was going to bring Lazarus
[52:20] yeah in front of us
[52:22] so I want to share something with you
[52:24] here
[52:25] now take your Bibles
[52:28] and turn to verse 44.
[52:31] and it said he that was dead
[52:35] came forth
[52:37] bound
[52:38] hand and foot
[52:40] with great clothes and his face was
[52:43] bound about him with a neck so we're
[52:46] going to place a napkin over your head
[52:49] okay oh my God does it fit now maybe
[52:53] you're supposed to be dead you ain't
[52:54] supposed to be mean
[52:57] you see
[52:58] I'm putting this around you okay let's
[53:01] see this ain't nothing you put around
[53:02] yourself oh all right come on okay come
[53:05] on yeah amen come on brother see Lazarus
[53:08] didn't put his gravel that's right
[53:10] that's right right
[53:12] see Lazarus was affected by what
[53:14] somebody else said about right amen the
[53:16] Lazarus was affected by uh what somebody
[53:20] thought of him yeah
[53:22] but he wasn't the one
[53:24] that put himself in this case that's
[53:26] right so I'll tell you about this you
[53:28] hold that right there I'm dead okay
[53:32] all right
[53:34] smart-ass preacher
[53:40] all right now oh we're not done
[53:46] now it says he was bound
[53:50] hand and foot
[53:52] what that means he was wrapped around
[53:56] oh my look at this I want y'all to see
[53:59] the condition this man is in
[54:01] all right now watch this
[54:06] now here's a man
[54:08] that the voice of the Resurrection
[54:10] that's gonna be a good picture there on

[54:30] just don't know it's a long ways to
[54:32] travel yeah yeah the voice said
[54:38] right
[54:39] and that did not stop a man who was in
[54:44] that condition right because God was
[54:48] calling him to another condition right
[54:51] and he was bringing him forth and that
[54:54] voice that was transcending to another
[54:57] dimension
[54:59] spoke to Lazarus and brought him back
[55:01] and put him in that body let me tell you
[55:03] something he wasn't halfway resurrected
[55:06] right Gloria here was a man

[55:18] he's resurrected right right
[55:21] but he's still

[55:39] himself
[55:41] oh we need some strong Brothers and
[55:43] Sisters in Christ come on we need some

[55:49] need something to know how to get loose
[55:51] we need to know something next
[55:56] what you've gone through
[55:58] might not have been meant for you it was
[56:01] for somebody else
[56:03] not even for you that pain and hurt and
[56:07] sorrow that you went through wasn't even
[56:09] for you but it was for you to come and
[56:12] be in a church that when somebody else

[57:08] and they said well he said these are
[57:12] some things here that we really believe
[57:14] that you'll have to start taking with
[57:17] your heart and things like that

[1:04:47] anymore
[1:04:48] all those dead things anymore I've been
[1:04:51] Justified amen I've been brought to a
[1:04:54] place as though it was never done to me
[1:04:56] right
[1:04:57] Hallelujah God think of a church
[1:05:02] who needs all these great clothes
[1:05:05] but there he was he was wrapped in all
[1:05:07] that he couldn't he couldn't help what
[1:05:09] he was wrapped in
[1:05:11] see your mama may have called you
[1:05:12] certain things your daddy may have said
[1:05:14] this about you right all these things
[1:05:16] like that and they still have an effect
[1:05:18] upon you but I'm telling you this is how
[1:05:21] you overcome stinky thinking you have to
[1:05:25] see yourself the way God
[1:05:29] exactly that's right are you with me

[1:05:50] place
[1:05:51] the words as though you never did it to
[1:05:53] begin with
[1:05:56] but you never did it right
[1:06:01] so it shows you he can overcome any
[1:06:03] condition right right
[1:06:06] maybe today you're in a condition
[1:06:08] and you think it's hopeless
[1:06:11] you think there's no there's no help
[1:06:12] right but nothing can be done about the
[1:06:15] situation
[1:06:19] but he says
[1:06:21] not Lazarus
[1:06:24] go forth right
[1:06:27] that is the voice of the Resurrection
[1:06:30] the same one that spoke to Luther that
[1:06:33] said the just you'll live by faith
[1:06:35] come on church it's the same one that
[1:06:38] spoke to Lazarus and said loose him it's
[1:06:42] the same voice that speaks to you in
[1:06:45] these gray clothes right right that says
[1:06:47] come forth
[1:06:50] Museum
[1:06:52] and set him free
[1:06:54] praise be the guy amen amen
[1:06:59] what was calling Lazarus forth
[1:07:01] Perfection right
[1:07:04] come on Church
[1:07:06] Perfection was calling Lazarus to come
[1:07:09] forth right
[1:07:11] the voice of the age was calling Lazarus
[1:07:15] to come forth see that same voice that
[1:07:21] spoke to Luther that spoke to Wesley
[1:07:23] that speaks to Pentecost is the same
[1:07:26] voice as speaking to you
[1:07:28] and it's the same voice that see the
[1:07:32] voice that summons all things is the
[1:07:34] voice that resists
[1:07:40] releases the place
[1:07:43] that they that you're in
[1:07:47] so that same voice
[1:07:49] that spoke to Luther and said
[1:07:52] but just shall live by faith exactly
[1:07:55] but in our message
[1:07:57] justification
[1:08:00] a deeper understanding of the word is it
[1:08:04] as though you never did it in the first
[1:08:06] place man all right man all right
[1:08:09] see in Luther's day his people didn't
[1:08:11] even hear that right
[1:08:13] but they're hearing it now right amen
[1:08:15] yeah right
[1:08:17] they're hearing it now that's right
[1:08:19] because this voice that's speaking in
[1:08:21] this hour speaking to those of us in the
[1:08:24] message is not only bringing us to a
[1:08:26] change but that same voice is
[1:08:28] transcending into another dimension my
[1:08:30] brother and sister and it is releasing
[1:08:32] them amen it is releasing them to come
[1:08:36] back Hallelujah
[1:08:38] Glory God Amen I hope this is helping
[1:08:41] you this morning right right so you
[1:08:43] don't need these gray clothes right
[1:08:45] right he's dead
[1:08:47] things of the past thank you brother I
[1:08:50] appreciate it thank you these dead
[1:08:52] things of the past you don't need them
[1:08:56] no more sorry amen amen we'll just lay
[1:08:58] them right down there all right right
[1:09:01] amen
[1:09:02] maybe somebody might with a little Act
[1:09:05] of Faith come up and just reach down and
[1:09:07] say
[1:09:09] I don't need these dead things anymore
[1:09:12] these things are done I'm living a
[1:09:15] resurrected life now I don't need what
[1:09:18] binds me I don't need what ties me up I
[1:09:21] don't need what raps the dead things in
[1:09:24] my life
[1:09:26] but see that voice
[1:09:28] that voice
[1:09:30] is the same voice right right and that
[1:09:33] voice that is changing us right yes
[1:09:36] absolutely it's releasing really
[1:09:41] that's right Hallelujah right
[1:09:46] see you stand
[1:09:48] Justified would you like to see
[1:09:52] something
[1:09:54] brother Branham says watch this I hope
[1:09:58] this is blessing amen he says
[1:10:01] uh now for instance if brother green
[1:10:03] heard that I had been drinking
[1:10:05] and I've been doing bad things then he
[1:10:07] found out that I didn't do it yeah right
[1:10:10] did he come and said I forgive you
[1:10:13] brother Brandon said if you forgive me
[1:10:15] I never done it
[1:10:18] what you forgiving me about
[1:10:20] but if I'm guilty then I can be forgiven
[1:10:25] right
[1:10:25] but I'm still not just because I did it
[1:10:31] but the word
[1:10:33] justifies is as though you never done it
[1:10:39] in the first place you were never
[1:10:42] married to that old and damn nature to
[1:10:46] begin with amen
[1:10:48] and that's what he's calling out of you
[1:10:51] to come forth that seed of God in you to
[1:10:55] bring you to the place where God wants
[1:10:57] you to be oh hallelujah amen so you
[1:11:01] stand Justified right Justified he said
[1:11:04] as though you never done it at all and
[1:11:08] then the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses
[1:11:11] us from all sin amen till it's putting
[1:11:15] the book of God's forgetfulness we can't
[1:11:18] we can forgive but not forget
[1:11:26] what you have to do now is take that
[1:11:29] mind
[1:11:31] of Christ
[1:11:33] that you're supposed to receive yeah
[1:11:36] and believe what that mind of Christ
[1:11:38] tells you right you are
[1:11:41] Christ is mine told him he can walk
[1:11:43] through the wall right cross his mind
[1:11:45] told him that he could resurrect he
[1:11:48] received the vision of the father and
[1:11:50] the father gave it to him and he
[1:11:53] believed Lazarus would come forth right
[1:11:58] absolutely see it's that Vision that's
[1:12:01] right
[1:12:02] and that's what you have right yes right
[1:12:05] I can't catch it for you
[1:12:08] know why because he said Lazarus right
[1:12:12] yeah it's a personal
[1:12:15] resolution right
[1:12:17] brother Branham said if he hadn't said
[1:12:19] Lazarus had been a general Resurrection
[1:12:24] so apparently there must have been just
[1:12:25] one last you were sitting there I guess
[1:12:27] right
[1:12:28] amen but he didn't say come forth
[1:12:33] he said Lazarus it's personal
[1:12:36] salvation is personal
[1:12:39] thank you Lord all right brother Grace
[1:12:42] is personal and I'll tell you something
[1:12:45] God does Grace good
[1:12:49] I fell a lot at it amen sometimes I
[1:12:52] struggle with things but God does great
[1:12:55] school glory sometimes I should forgive
[1:12:57] a brother or do this that or the other
[1:12:59] maybe I don't do it when I should but
[1:13:01] God always does great skin all right
[1:13:03] amen Glory Hallelujah that's right you
[1:13:06] remember that one right not always
[1:13:08] disgrace good right amen so here you are
[1:13:11] standing
[1:13:13] Justified

[1:24:24] it's called weakness
[1:24:27] the woman the Bible says is the weaker
[1:24:29] vessel that's right
[1:24:30] so you need to learn to enter into your
[1:24:32] weakness
[1:24:35] honey
[1:24:37] honey

[1:24:42] can't get him to take the trash out

[1:25:41] man's ego yeah
[1:25:43] once you enter into his ego you

[1:25:49] it is he has to know you need his
[1:25:53] strength right yeah that's right
[1:25:56] are you listening to him yes he has to
[1:25:59] know that
[1:26:01] yeah so that's why it's important
[1:26:04] brothers that we live the life right
[1:26:06] yeah yes sir well she will call us Lord
[1:26:10] yeah
[1:26:11] and not oh my Lord
[1:26:16] when he will call us right I mean I will
[1:26:20] come because we have a worthy headship
[1:26:22] right right right you can't demand
[1:26:25] subjection you can't demand those things
[1:26:30] if you want her to be in the subjection
[1:26:32] leader into it and show her by you by
[1:26:34] his surrendered and understand getting
[1:26:36] into your subjection with Christ
[1:26:39] that's right amen
[1:26:41] oh my how did we get this out of Lazarus
[1:26:43] grave I'm telling you
[1:26:47] I guess it's time for us to come forward
[1:26:48] that's right it's time for us to be what
[1:26:53] God has caused amen
[1:26:57] young people God is calling you
[1:27:00] that's right oh I was so touched
[1:27:03] by the young people up here
[1:27:06] I was just so just touched just
[1:27:08] listening to him singing and see him
[1:27:11] being apart
[1:27:12] that's why so
[1:27:14] be careful young people
[1:27:17] the things that you're attracted to
[1:27:19] right
[1:27:21] because the devil knows human nature
[1:27:24] right yeah because brother Branham said
[1:27:26] he helped pervert it yeah we are right
[1:27:29] right
[1:27:30] your parents you watch your kids yep
[1:27:35] sometimes we get guilty we'll allow will
[1:27:39] allow us to just go anywhere
[1:27:45] either as
[1:27:47] well amen right but I was really touched
[1:27:50] by the young people
[1:27:52] and I was seeing their desire to serve
[1:27:54] him and I would rather see that than see
[1:27:57] them out here listening to some bunch of
[1:27:59] rock and roll or some rap music or
[1:28:01] seeing the way these kids aren't let me
[1:28:03] tell you something young kids they may
[1:28:05] make fun of you and all that but I want
[1:28:07] to tell you something they are empty
[1:28:09] right
[1:28:12] and even your young little life can
[1:28:14] manifest Christ amen exactly don't you
[1:28:18] ever be afraid to stand up for Christ
[1:28:20] because Christ will stand up for you
[1:28:22] amen
[1:28:25] no get out here and try to be so loner
[1:28:29] sometimes you hear teenage well I can't
[1:28:31] wait till I get 18 years old and I get
[1:28:33] out of the house and I can do what I
[1:28:34] want to do yeah
[1:28:36] yeah no you're gonna do what everybody
[1:28:38] else does that's right
[1:28:40] you ain't gonna be no more different
[1:28:41] than nobody if you're gonna fall right
[1:28:43] into the Trap of the world right you
[1:28:46] ain't no more special right right
[1:28:49] we come to that place we have to at your
[1:28:52] young age
[1:28:53] ask the Lord
[1:28:55] Lord I want you in my heart
[1:28:59] Lord I want you
[1:29:01] to save me right Lord I want to hear
[1:29:06] that voice that Lazarus sir brother
[1:29:08] Keith said it's the same voice Lord I'm
[1:29:11] gonna go into my room I'm going to pray
[1:29:13] and I'm going to ask you Lord to come
[1:29:15] into my heart
[1:29:18] and young people
[1:29:19] we'll do it you ain't got to be old and
[1:29:23] decrepit and come with all kinds of sins
[1:29:25] and debaucheries in your life give your
[1:29:28] life to him early
[1:29:33] see Satan knows
[1:29:36] the nature
[1:29:37] and he knows what to put in front of you
[1:29:40] right yeah because he understands right
[1:29:42] Satan is like the eskimos
[1:29:47] when the eskimos start having trouble
[1:29:50] with a lone wolf
[1:29:53] they understand how to get rid of that
[1:29:56] wolf
[1:29:58] and what they'll do
[1:30:00] is the wolf has a nature
[1:30:04] and wolves have to be in packs because
[1:30:07] one has to rip and tear right but when
[1:30:10] the moon is a loner
[1:30:11] he's he's just a troublemaker yeah he
[1:30:14] he's a scavenger and he can cause all
[1:30:17] kinds of problems
[1:30:20] and what this Eskimo will do they
[1:30:21] understand human nature
[1:30:23] and they will take a knife
[1:30:28] and they will take this knife
[1:30:31] and they will dip it
[1:30:34] and as they dip it
[1:30:36] and they dip it and they dip it and they
[1:30:38] dip it and they dip it what happens
[1:30:40] they're different in blood
[1:30:45] and they come out they have a knife
[1:30:48] it's frozen blood right
[1:30:52] let's see the Eskimo understands the
[1:30:54] nature of the wolf he knows he's a wild
[1:30:56] animal and he's got to have blood
[1:30:59] to to to to take the taste and
[1:31:02] to satisfy his taste right
[1:31:04] and they ask them oh he'll just go out
[1:31:07] into the snow and he'll just go
[1:31:11] and he'll leave right right
[1:31:14] and young people all of a sudden
[1:31:17] oh
[1:31:35] right
[1:31:39] and he gets the taste of blood right
[1:31:43] and the blood is Frozen
[1:31:47] and when a wild animal gets the taste of
[1:31:49] blood it'll literally make him drunk
[1:31:51] right because of the alcohol that's in
[1:31:53] the blood that's why launcher sticks his
[1:31:56] head in a dead carcass because he sticks
[1:31:58] his head that's why he's bald head and
[1:32:00] he sticks his head in there and he does
[1:32:02] what he does and he pulls himself out
[1:32:05] and he staggers around drunk because
[1:32:07] he's drunk on the blood the alcohol in
[1:32:09] the blood the knife is stuck here and
[1:32:12] the wolf comes up and the next thing you
[1:32:14] know he starts licking and he starts
[1:32:16] licking and the next thing you know it
[1:32:17] gets smaller and smaller and smaller and
[1:32:21] smaller and the next thing you know he's
[1:32:23] sitting here and he's licking and he's
[1:32:25] licking and now the sharp knife is
[1:32:28] ripping the tongue of the of the wolf
[1:32:31] and now he doesn't even know the
[1:32:34] difference between the taste of the
[1:32:37] blood he was tasty and his own blood
[1:32:40] right
[1:32:41] and he kills himself
[1:32:45] see Satan knows the nature
[1:32:50] Fallen man
[1:32:52] young people he knows what to put on the
[1:32:55] internet right yes
[1:32:58] he knows
[1:33:00] how your little hearts are yep
[1:33:03] are you with me right and the next thing
[1:33:06] you know all the blood is gone
[1:33:08] and there's a knife
[1:33:13] and a wolf
[1:33:15] is ripping his tongue to Pieces because
[1:33:18] he's become insane with the taste of the
[1:33:20] blood and now he starts being satisfied
[1:33:26] by his own blood right and now he's
[1:33:29] getting more and more and more until he
[1:33:31] rips his tongue to pieces and now the
[1:33:34] next day they find the wolf stuck over
[1:33:37] the night
[1:33:39] and the Eskimo just grabs him
[1:33:42] picks him up
[1:33:44] and discards him
[1:33:47] and he did it
[1:33:49] because it's new the nature that's why
[1:33:53] your Nature has to be changed amen
[1:33:57] that's right amen absolutely right are
[1:34:01] you with me that's why your Nature has
[1:34:04] that old Nature has to be done away
[1:34:08] right exactly you need to ask God bring
[1:34:11] me to the place Lord I don't want that
[1:34:13] anymore Lord in my life Lord I find
[1:34:16] myself Lord God doing things that mommy
[1:34:18] man said I shouldn't do but I want to do
[1:34:20] it
[1:34:22] young people I'm here to tell you
[1:34:24] there's a way that you can change right

[1:42:28] for Faith from everybody that came in
[1:42:30] the room because I'll be honest with you
[1:42:32] I'll Stand before you but on the sacred
[1:42:33] desk I was scared
[1:42:35] sure
[1:42:39] I did not know if I was going to live
[1:42:42] the next day that's what they kept
[1:42:44] telling me a blood clot can break off

[1:42:50] amen tell me you don't hear that voice
[1:42:53] speaking to you that's right
[1:42:56] that's right and I got right to the
[1:42:57] place I did not know I just I could not
[1:43:00] get the faith I needed I could not just
[1:43:02] couldn't get the peace I needed and I'll
[1:43:05] tell you what God don't care about your
[1:43:07] comfort

[1:43:12] all the way down where that male nurse
[1:43:14] they they shave you they strip you your
[1:43:18] dignity is exposed to everything about
[1:43:20] you is just exposed
[1:43:24] and I asked that man I said could I have
[1:43:25] my Bible and he said sure and he handed
[1:43:28] it to me and I flipped the Bible open to
[1:43:29] Proverbs 1 and 21 and it said the heart
[1:43:31] of the king is in the Lord's hands
[1:43:41] that's the peace that God can give you
[1:43:43] amen
[1:43:45] I lost my wife

[1:44:11] us a sacred Nest at my church
[1:44:13] ministering the life of Job yeah
[1:44:17] yeah walked out the door my wife had
[1:44:19] stayed home that day I hope this is okay
[1:44:21] if I can just share this with me just
[1:44:23] just to be an open book so you see and
[1:44:26] I walked out the door my my uh
[1:44:29] daughter-in-law comes screaming said
[1:44:31] that uh Angie she was laying on the
[1:44:33] floor she was blue said that they
[1:44:36] couldn't get her to breathe she she rise
[1:44:39] and rolled back I got in the vehicle
[1:44:40] took off of the house walked in and
[1:44:42] there was my beautiful wife laying there
[1:44:44] died right there in front of the
[1:44:46] refrigerator
[1:44:48] died right there
[1:44:51] they tried Heroes to my older Sons
[1:44:54] trying to resuscitate her and they
[1:44:56] couldn't do it all of a sudden through
[1:44:58] the worst of that through that trauma
[1:45:00] and that horrible experience I looked up
[1:45:03] in a glimpse God all he had to do is
[1:45:05] give you a glimpse and this is the
[1:45:07] honest truth God strike me with
[1:45:09] lightning brothers and sisters I taught
[1:45:11] I saw two forms come out of her
[1:45:14] and I saw them raise up
[1:45:16] and I saw my two sons on the earth
[1:45:18] trying to resuscitate her and I saw
[1:45:20] these two forms come up and they had
[1:45:22] hair both about this length right there
[1:45:25] and my wife come up out of her body and
[1:45:27] she took one arm and she took the other
[1:45:30] arm and she went right through that
[1:45:32] refrigerator
[1:45:34] just like that
[1:45:38] and that was a glimpse that God gave me
[1:45:40] to help me to overcome all the lonely
[1:45:43] days and all the nights that laid ahead
[1:45:45] of me and my brother and sister that's
[1:45:47] right brother and the hardest thing that
[1:45:48] I had to overcome was where she died at
[1:45:53] that used to just tear me up that God
[1:45:55] wanted you to let her die in front of
[1:45:57] this refrigerator
[1:45:59] why not in the room over here why I
[1:46:02] gotta get up late at night and go to the
[1:46:04] refrigerator and stand over the very
[1:46:06] place
[1:46:08] right where my wife died
[1:46:12] and one day my two daughters were crying
[1:46:14] and there was just turmoil in the house
[1:46:16] and everything and the quote come to my
[1:46:18] heart to overcome you have to do the
[1:46:21] opposite yeah right when I called my
[1:46:24] girls over and I said come here girls
[1:46:26] come here let's pray and I took both of
[1:46:29] them in our arms and then we stood right
[1:46:31] over the very spot and we held each
[1:46:33] other in each other's arms and I started
[1:46:35] talking to him and praying with them and
[1:46:37] coaxing them and just wooing them and
[1:46:39] just trying to give them peace and
[1:46:41] strength and then the Lord quickened on
[1:46:43] my heart that's how you overcome the
[1:46:45] complex you have to do the opposite so
[1:46:47] now instead of that place being a place
[1:46:49] of death and despair we turn it into a
[1:46:52] place of joy and victory that's why I
[1:46:56] tell you today saints of God you can't
[1:46:58] overcome but you have to do the opposite
[1:47:00] exactly
[1:47:03] help us Lord oh praise God I didn't know
[1:47:07] I was going to say all that amen maybe
[1:47:10] that maybe that'll encourage you
[1:47:14] man help you to realize
[1:47:16] God
[1:47:17] can change any
[1:47:21] any God can bring peace glory in the
[1:47:24] time of a stand amen okay God can turn
[1:47:27] your marriage

[1:48:13] the form of the Son of God Jesus Christ

[1:48:20] lose you God's own blood right not the
[1:48:24] blood of a Jew or a blood of a gentile
