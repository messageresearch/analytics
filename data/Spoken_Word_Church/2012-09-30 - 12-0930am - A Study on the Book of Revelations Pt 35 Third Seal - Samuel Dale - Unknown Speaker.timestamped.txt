[8:05] you said it
[8:06] lord you said you sent your word and
[8:08] healed us
[8:09] and delivered us from our destruction
[8:11] so we just commit everything into your
[8:13] hands and we try to speak about you
[8:15] you come on the scene and speak to our
[8:17] hearts we love you and we thank you
[8:19] in jesus name
[8:21] amen
[8:23] revelations one
[8:25] we've been on this for quite a while of
[8:27] revelation one that we just used in
[8:29] secondary scripture
[8:33] it says the revelation of jesus christ
[8:35] which god gave unto him
[8:37] to show unto his servants things which
[8:39] must shortly come to pass
[8:41] and he said and signified it by his
[8:43] angel
[8:44] unto his servant john
[8:46] who bear record of the word of god and
[8:48] the testimony of jesus christ and of all
[8:50] things that he saw
[8:52] blessed is he that readeth and they that
[8:54] hear the words of this prophecy and keep
[8:56] those things which are written therein
[8:58] for the time
[9:00] is at hand what time to understand
[9:05] amen and we go to revelation six
[9:08] we'll pick up verse five and six
[9:12] and when he had opened the third seal i
[9:14] heard the third beast say come and see
[9:17] and be held and and i be held in love a
[9:19] black horse and he that sat on him had a
[9:21] pair of balances in his hand
[9:24] and i heard a voice in the midst of the
[9:25] four beasts say
[9:27] a measure of wheat for a
[9:29] measure of wheat for a penny and three
[9:32] measures of barley for a penny
[9:34] and see thou hurt not the oil
[9:37] and the wine you may be seated lord that
[9:40] is blessing to the
[9:42] reading of the word
[9:44] now
[9:46] we're trying to
[9:48] study these things and
[9:52] you know to try to see our day
[9:54] and our time that we're dwelling upon
[9:55] the earth that's right and the main
[9:57] thing and i'll repeat this in a minute
[9:59] because i want you to get it
[10:02] we're not talking about these things to
[10:04] just look back
[10:06] and see what was
[10:09] i i'm wanting you and i to see what's
[10:11] taking place now
[10:13] an hour day in our time because to
[10:15] preach about what it was back there is a
[10:19] it's just a story you know right just a
[10:22] thought or an idea
[10:23] and you know it can be true and i'm sure
[10:25] it is but
[10:28] we want to get it down to the day that
[10:30] we're living
[10:32] the prophet preached a message one time
[10:33] recognizing your day
[10:36] in its message
[10:38] well
[10:39] it's not only just recognizing the day
[10:41] and the hour that that the prophet was
[10:43] to come upon the earth and bring a
[10:44] message but to recognize your day
[10:48] that's what i'm trying to get you to see
[10:49] the book of revelations
[10:51] is written to you
[10:53] because the things that are happening in
[10:56] from revelation 6 1 on through right you
[10:59] know
[11:00] it's not concerned with the bride
[11:03] it's it's to israel
[11:05] but we look at that and we see what will
[11:07] happen there
[11:08] and then we see what's happening now
[11:11] because what happens there
[11:13] has its beginning here that's right
[11:16] are you listening that's the main thing
[11:17] i want you to see
[11:19] whatever would happen
[11:21] it'll have its beginning somewhere
[11:23] that's like in genesis everything begins
[11:26] in genesis all right
[11:28] and then it comes down to this day
[11:31] any doctrine any idea any thought you
[11:34] can go back to genesis with it
[11:36] all right then you can take the seals
[11:38] and and one of them will tie the entire
[11:40] bible together the prophet said
[11:42] all right then we can go back through
[11:44] the bible and see
[11:46] the day that we're living
[11:48] right
[11:50] it's fine to look back and see what
[11:51] somebody else done like what he was
[11:53] saying one time you know he's preaching
[11:54] about abraham he said well wait a minute
[11:56] i'm not i'm not just talking about
[11:58] abraham
[11:59] i mean it's our journey
[12:02] it's our doing decision right here now
[12:04] there's no need of just just stories to
[12:06] tell about somebody else
[12:09] but when you experience it yourself
[12:11] you live through it
[12:13] then you can see
[12:15] you know your day and it's time and who
[12:18] you are
[12:19] it's not going to put us in the rapture
[12:22] to know the bible now listen to what i'm
[12:24] saying
[12:26] even to know the letter of the bible
[12:28] that we could read it that we could
[12:30] memorize it
[12:32] to be able to quote every verse in the
[12:34] bible that's not going to put us in the
[12:36] rapture right
[12:37] it's when the word is revealed
[12:40] luther preached
[12:42] no telling how many sermons on
[12:44] maybe a topic called the just shall live
[12:47] by faith
[12:49] because he preached the bible
[12:51] and surely he preached a lot of things
[12:53] but see one day it was quickened
[12:56] that's right
[12:58] and when it was quickened
[12:59] he was not afraid see maybe what he was
[13:02] seeing it caused a lot of uprisings had
[13:04] come back in that time and people were
[13:07] trying to protest the catholic church
[13:09] and things and their control
[13:11] and
[13:12] you know they'd be afraid
[13:15] not like the apostles were when they
[13:17] were gathered in the upper room
[13:19] they had the letter of the word right
[13:21] amen
[13:22] they'd walk with the lord jesus
[13:24] but they were scared to death right
[13:27] but when the holy ghost came
[13:29] he took away their fear
[13:31] it made something personal
[13:33] see when martin luther when it was
[13:35] revealed to him then he came off the
[13:37] pages into his heart and his soul of
[13:39] being was a just shall live by faith
[13:43] then he was not afraid of the world
[13:46] he said let them know that i'm against
[13:48] them
[13:50] you have no problems with being scared
[13:52] about being
[13:54] excommunicated
[13:55] because you know what that means to a
[13:57] catholic
[13:58] you know saying the other day
[14:00] you know
[14:02] we think about
[14:03] see bring that down to where we're at
[14:05] right now
[14:06] that we think about you know that
[14:08] uh
[14:10] when we've got to stay in the catholic
[14:11] church
[14:13] because
[14:14] mama
[14:15] is still in purgatory
[14:17] and we ain't got her out yet
[14:20] so we got to play her out you know and
[14:22] then then honey maybe we'll think about
[14:24] leaving once we get mama and grandma and
[14:27] grandpa all out of purgatory
[14:29] we'll see we would laugh about that
[14:32] right but have you ever talked to people
[14:34] that said
[14:36] well
[14:38] if the badness was good enough for mama
[14:42] it's good enough for me
[14:44] i'll stay here because mama
[14:47] was a good baptist well that's good mama
[14:49] was a good bad this probably might have
[14:50] been a good christian
[14:53] but what has that got to do with me and
[14:55] you yeah
[14:56] you know what right what has it got to
[14:58] do with you and i about anybody else
[15:00] right
[15:01] christianity is not based upon you and
[15:03] somebody else is based upon jesus christ
[15:06] in him alone
[15:09] what everybody else is is great i love
[15:11] my mother she raised all of us
[15:13] you know could have adopted us all out
[15:15] and got rid of us nine of us and she
[15:17] could have thrown us all away but she
[15:19] chose to raise us after daddy died
[15:22] well i love her and appreciate it
[15:25] but you know i'm not going to stay i i
[15:27] couldn't stay
[15:28] where mama had went
[15:31] right
[15:31] when the word was revealed i had to move
[15:33] on
[15:34] i've told you my brother came out he
[15:36] said where you going i said i don't know
[15:37] but i can't stay here
[15:40] he said well you want a church we'll
[15:41] build you one
[15:43] i said that's not what it is
[15:46] he said i've got to find my own way
[15:50] i've got to walk in whatever's leading
[15:52] me that's
[15:57] i don't have anything against anybody
[16:00] i said about my own people or see right
[16:04] but yet they're so tied up in their
[16:06] church
[16:10] until they think the church is going to
[16:11] take them right well that's the
[16:13] deception i'm trying to get you to see
[16:16] that's the things that we're trying to
[16:17] go through
[16:18] to get us to see here
[16:20] why we are like we are
[16:24] why is it that we're odd and different
[16:28] well you're just a bunch of people got
[16:30] another cult
[16:32] we're called a cult
[16:34] and i don't mind saying it
[16:36] probably about 75 percent of the people
[16:39] of this message are a cult
[16:41] that's right and i'm against them
[16:44] so then that's just it right i'll just
[16:46] talk plain okay
[16:48] because i don't build it up to say oh
[16:49] we're the only one where we're with this
[16:52] no the truth is the only one
[16:54] right
[16:56] so we got to do something about the
[16:57] truth man the bible says you shall know
[16:59] the truth not know about truth
[17:02] you shall know d notice that b
[17:05] means singular it was john d baptist
[17:08] meant it was just one
[17:11] if it was saying john of baptist
[17:13] then you could have a whole lot of them
[17:15] right but when it said john b
[17:17] it right
[17:18] it was that's right lord the christ
[17:22] there's only one right
[17:24] so then looking at the word and seeing
[17:27] it
[17:28] and trying to follow it down to where
[17:30] we're at
[17:32] let's find our day right
[17:35] let's search our hearts
[17:40] you know you don't know you've got error
[17:42] until truth is made
[17:45] that's known
[17:48] i was in the baptist church for a long
[17:50] time deacon for
[17:51] about
[17:53] five years or more i don't really
[17:55] remember
[17:58] you know i believe they were right
[18:02] i knew they had a lot of problems yeah
[18:06] but i still believe the word i thought
[18:09] but one day i found out that
[18:12] that wasn't exactly it
[18:15] they had truth but i wanted to be true
[18:17] right
[18:20] then i wanted to read the word for
[18:21] myself
[18:24] i want somebody else to read it for
[18:25] myself
[18:27] and see what it says
[18:28] all right
[18:29] now in the opening of these seals that
[18:32] we're talking about the the preaching of
[18:34] what we're doing
[18:35] to kind of back up and review up to
[18:37] where we are
[18:41] see we saw the first seal when it broke
[18:44] a white horse rider it was a rider and a
[18:46] white horse
[18:48] he had a bow and no arrows
[18:50] a crown was given to him later
[18:53] all
[18:54] right
[18:56] in that antichrist system
[18:59] because that's who that was that was the
[19:01] antichrist that little john spoke up
[19:03] when he calls it the antichrist
[19:07] an antichrist system is just a little
[19:09] savings
[19:10] the doctrines little cults
[19:14] and i told you we went back to genesis
[19:16] with it that
[19:18] abel was
[19:20] okay he tried to tell cain the truth
[19:22] right
[19:25] how many years don't know because they
[19:27] were offering sacrifices so that means
[19:30] it had to be on up to adulthood never
[19:32] what you want to call it
[19:35] he came
[19:37] he was trying to tell abel what the
[19:38] truth was he thought
[19:41] and that's what caused him to come up
[19:43] with a doctrine
[19:46] and he went from a doctrine to
[19:50] a basis did he become incarnate with his
[19:52] doctrine
[19:54] and he wouldn't believe what abel was
[19:55] saying
[19:57] so he killed cain i mean killed abraham
[20:01] so then the white horse he was the
[20:04] antichrist riding out to the deception
[20:08] all right second seal we saw that it was
[20:10] a red horse
[20:12] same rider
[20:15] but a red horse
[20:19] and it was given unto him to make war
[20:21] and to do things and
[20:23] to kill with a sword
[20:26] we can see that that been all the way
[20:28] through the bible because that's what it
[20:29] was talking about that's where
[20:31] cane didn't kill april
[20:35] now watch it when we get into this
[20:37] this one
[20:39] that it winds up being a black horse
[20:43] if i don't get back to it just watch
[20:45] kane
[20:46] see
[20:48] a curse was put on cane
[20:51] not to make him black
[20:54] it wouldn't the curse that would have
[20:56] been done away at the flood
[21:01] but it was a curse it was put on him
[21:05] the mark of the beast right right
[21:08] was put on him
[21:10] but darkness was put upon the heart
[21:13] of cain that's right
[21:16] god even told kenny in person
[21:21] said if you would have done what your
[21:24] brother
[21:26] done
[21:28] you would have been accepted is that
[21:29] what the bible said
[21:33] but instead of darkness came upon him
[21:36] blackness
[21:41] that he was never converted right
[21:45] you would never have anything to do with
[21:46] it and become a battle ever since
[21:49] you know
[21:51] see
[21:52] he said but brother dale you're talking
[21:54] about good
[21:56] people kane was a good man
[21:59] sure
[22:01] you know he wasn't a murderer
[22:04] mabel was a murderer right
[22:07] yeah
[22:09] come on abel killed an animal
[22:12] to take his place
[22:14] kane was a good guy out working himself
[22:16] to death
[22:21] but that wasn't what god said
[22:23] that's right he said it was blood right
[22:27] we see
[22:28] the world is full of good people
[22:34] good religious people
[22:36] just like it was there when jesus came
[22:38] on the earth
[22:40] was there anything that jesus could say
[22:42] about those pharisees about what
[22:45] how they were keeping the law
[22:48] no
[22:51] but he was just trying to tell them that
[22:54] they couldn't see pastor into their nose
[22:58] you remember the only trouble that god
[23:00] had with
[23:04] job
[23:07] you remember the thing that job's
[23:09] problem right
[23:11] job said i've offered what god said for
[23:13] me to offer
[23:17] but he thought the offering of the
[23:19] animal made him
[23:22] right
[23:24] when it was not the offering of the
[23:25] animal that was just the commandment to
[23:27] give right it was a believing believing
[23:29] in god
[23:33] the problem with job was he he didn't
[23:35] put everything into god
[23:37] he put it in i've done it that's right
[23:39] and he had
[23:41] you remember and the three guys kept
[23:43] talking to him but finally hell are you
[23:45] you know got
[23:46] that's right
[23:47] answered which was god to him
[23:50] he said you wanted to talk to me and i'm
[23:52] down here now to talk to you
[23:54] he said all all that i see wrong with
[23:56] you said you're just a little
[23:57] self-righteous
[24:01] he's self-righteous and he thought that
[24:02] what he'd done was right he was
[24:04] now the pharisees were self-righteous
[24:07] right right
[24:11] but jesus said unless you exceed the
[24:13] righteousness of the scribes and
[24:15] pharisees you won't
[24:22] they were righteous they were perfect
[24:24] you couldn't put a finger on them
[24:26] because you couldn't they would have
[24:27] killed them
[24:31] but yet they rejected god when he stood
[24:33] there
[24:35] could we do the same today
[24:40] see by accepting you just trying to live
[24:42] the word to the letter
[24:44] man we can be a pharisee
[24:48] an actor that's right
[24:52] you see i want to be a christian don't
[24:54] you yeah
[24:56] that's the whole of the bible what are
[24:58] the seals
[24:59] the plagues the viles or things we talk
[25:01] about
[25:02] it's a revelation of jesus christ
[25:08] but where's he at now he's in you and i
[25:10] am right all right
[25:12] we're not talking about a historical god
[25:14] of 2000 years ago that walked the shores
[25:17] of galilee
[25:20] we're talking about the god that we
[25:22] claim to have within us
[25:25] in the new earth
[25:28] and to walk therein
[25:30] see so it went from what an antichrist
[25:33] this is a little saiyan
[25:36] it went down from that to a false
[25:39] prophet
[25:40] paul dealt with them while he was here
[25:46] paul didn't call it antichrist because
[25:48] he'd never been to pat with some back
[25:49] john i had
[25:53] but paul would call it grievous woods
[25:57] false prophets
[25:58] right because by the time of paul that's
[26:00] what it's become
[26:02] men teaching perverse things like
[26:04] philosophers and armenians they're how
[26:06] you pronounce them teaching that the
[26:07] resurrection was passed
[26:12] well
[26:14] see paul was teaching the resurrection
[26:16] with spice
[26:19] but his was a spiritual resurrection
[26:22] and a new birth into the heart of man
[26:24] they were teaching the physical
[26:26] resurrection
[26:27] it already transpired right
[26:30] well paul could have simply said well
[26:32] show them to me yeah
[26:34] but instead of arguing with him he just
[26:37] committed him to the devil
[26:40] let him take care of it
[26:44] you see the simplicity of the opening of
[26:46] the word
[26:47] amen
[26:49] see this antichrist this was this first
[26:52] seal he had a bow with no errors
[26:55] very innocent very
[26:57] uh
[27:00] almost seemingly powerless
[27:03] and you know that a doctrine or an idea
[27:05] is powerless until
[27:07] other people join together with you sure
[27:09] that's right
[27:12] but by the time they came into the
[27:13] second seal see a crown was given him in
[27:15] the first
[27:17] what a triple ruling crown
[27:21] they made a poke
[27:24] when they made a pope out of the mansion
[27:27] they elected the head bishop
[27:29] you know
[27:31] they had all of them and they wanted to
[27:33] head
[27:35] kind of like israel right
[27:38] israel had a prophet
[27:41] but why did they want a king
[27:47] you see it's always through the bible
[27:49] why do they want a king
[27:52] we want to be like everybody else
[27:56] so they said we wanted a leader over all
[27:58] of us so they elected a pope
[28:02] because i told you he didn't start out a
[28:04] bad guy
[28:06] right it took many years before a lot of
[28:09] their doctrines came into view and they
[28:12] started killing
[28:14] right
[28:18] it came all the way on over
[28:22] in time
[28:25] before the killing started
[28:27] another second season
[28:29] all right
[28:30] now we read here in the third that is
[28:32] coming down to a
[28:34] a dark time
[28:38] now what i want you to think about today
[28:41] you don't get nothing out of the message
[28:43] get one thing
[28:47] we were to illustrate it oh i went with
[28:50] josh and him
[28:51] you know
[28:52] i may be a dodeo granddaddy but a dude
[28:56] but
[29:00] i went with josh one time on a
[29:03] tour of
[29:04] mcminnville where all the caves are at
[29:08] well you know if you turned out all
[29:09] these lots in here you'd say it's dark
[29:11] but it's really not
[29:14] have you ever been somewhere where it
[29:16] was just
[29:18] you seemed like it was the old saying
[29:20] you couldn't even see your finger before
[29:22] your nose
[29:25] so they were down there and they got us
[29:27] all together in one place and
[29:30] he said all right everybody turn off the
[29:32] flashlights and they turned off and that
[29:34] guy had a big old lantern thing and
[29:37] he turned that thing off and you talking
[29:39] about black yeah
[29:42] now if you said go north
[29:45] i'd ask you which way it was
[29:48] south or up or down or whatever
[29:51] it was black right right
[29:56] no hopes
[30:00] where we were at there was no hopes of
[30:02] finding our way out
[30:04] they claim that's what a lot of the cage
[30:06] dwellers done you know the guys that go
[30:08] back in on things back in the old days
[30:10] they had pine knots and stuff
[30:11] and they'd drop them or lose it and they
[30:13] just
[30:14] go haywire and kill yourself or fall off
[30:17] a hole
[30:19] because it's dark
[30:22] now that's what we want to think about
[30:24] today
[30:26] what would be the blackest of blackness
[30:28] you could think of
[30:32] i'm asking you for your definition
[30:37] wrote around and preached a little
[30:38] message one time
[30:41] you remember it was his first one
[30:44] he thought he done a good job
[30:46] i think he did but anyhow
[30:48] you remember he preached it
[30:51] started preaching about hell
[30:54] when he preached it there was no
[30:56] no mama there
[30:58] was no daddy there
[31:02] there was no god there
[31:05] he thought he'd done a good job i say i
[31:07] think he did because he got a point to
[31:09] me
[31:12] what is the what is darkness
[31:18] okay most of you are whispering it out
[31:20] so whatever it is what it's an absence
[31:23] of light
[31:25] now no matter how dark it was down in
[31:27] that
[31:28] hole
[31:31] if we had even just one little
[31:33] of those um
[31:35] lights that you
[31:37] pointers you know
[31:39] one of these little bitty
[31:41] bikes here yeah
[31:44] right it would have been like a greater
[31:48] luminous light to your eyes underground
[31:54] but what about when you can't even find
[31:56] that right
[31:58] right
[32:03] you probably said the reason it was sad
[32:05] for hell he said because god wasn't
[32:07] there
[32:11] you talk about something is when
[32:13] cain himself
[32:16] turned the bible said
[32:19] and walked away amen
[32:22] from the presence of the lord
[32:26] how dark is darkness
[32:33] how great is darkness
[32:37] what about someone who becomes so um
[32:42] one with a doctrinal issue right
[32:45] until you won't hear truth
[32:48] amen that's right
[32:50] it's all but if it's presented right
[32:52] don't you think jesus presented it right
[32:54] to the pharisees and sadducees
[32:58] don't you think so yeah
[33:01] i mean if you're not you're going to
[33:02] argue with god about the way to do that
[33:06] i think he's done a marvelous job
[33:07] presenting sweets off to him sure at
[33:10] times he had to say things
[33:13] but what could he have said at the other
[33:14] things
[33:19] darkness and blackness of cain
[33:24] to go away from the presence of god
[33:28] sure still have 20 20 vision
[33:32] let's seal yourself away because that's
[33:34] what i want you to watch today
[33:37] a darkness because that's what this
[33:39] third seal is it's a dark horse
[33:43] i remember what we were covering how
[33:44] we've been through it
[33:47] it's the same rider
[33:49] on each horse
[33:50] right
[33:53] because that rider starts out as an
[33:55] antichrist spirit
[33:57] which we'll find out this afternoon was
[33:59] already dead anyway
[34:01] but it wasn't called that right
[34:06] that antichrist spirit
[34:08] he was satan
[34:10] and the children of disobedience that
[34:12] paul would say
[34:14] deceiving the world
[34:19] deceived it so much
[34:21] until
[34:23] when he got off of that black horse
[34:27] he got on the red one
[34:31] and the same people that had accepted
[34:34] that antichrist thought
[34:38] wound up
[34:40] killing people
[34:46] if you don't agree with that get fox's
[34:47] book of martyrs and just see what all of
[34:49] the
[34:50] the historians said about it
[34:52] right
[34:54] that's what gets me and see the people
[34:55] who come along now and they can say well
[34:58] well we'll
[34:59] oh well we
[35:02] i guess we're wrong maybe the way we've
[35:04] done things or let's all be good
[35:07] brothers
[35:14] but you know there's an old story he
[35:16] said if the snake bites you once it's a
[35:18] snake's fault that's right
[35:20] it bites you twice
[35:23] it's yours
[35:28] but you see you got off of that white
[35:29] horse got on the red one and started
[35:30] killing
[35:33] wherever they ever apologized see if
[35:35] they apologized
[35:37] for the 68 million on their own record
[35:40] and say they was wrong
[35:42] they would be saying that that 68
[35:45] million
[35:47] were not going to heaven
[35:52] think about it
[35:55] they can't deny their own records
[35:58] they made their own records if they'd
[36:00] killed
[36:01] 68 million
[36:04] because remember the
[36:06] saint augustine wrote the decree
[36:10] but
[36:11] it was better to serve god
[36:13] by force than to not serve him at all
[36:16] so they killed 68 million
[36:18] so they're never going to apologize
[36:22] for killing all those people
[36:26] he said look but brother dale that was
[36:28] back yonder
[36:34] that was back to you under
[36:38] we were all different now
[36:40] we are
[36:45] i thought the same old people
[36:48] right right
[36:49] i didn't know the world had a conversion
[36:51] and made everybody a christian
[36:54] did you
[36:56] i thought it was still
[36:58] that same thing right amen
[37:03] but you see church what i've tried to
[37:04] get you to see just like i did there
[37:08] wednesday
[37:11] a lot of you have left churches and come
[37:13] here
[37:15] and you know what they said when you
[37:16] left
[37:19] you've left the word
[37:23] you're out from under the blood
[37:27] that happened with brother richard and
[37:29] them years ago
[37:31] in that situation that happened back
[37:32] there
[37:35] and they
[37:36] come down here
[37:37] i immediately call them up to the front
[37:40] and if you desire it i'd be glad to do
[37:42] it the end of the service
[37:46] i brought brother richard and his family
[37:47] up to the
[37:48] front and i said i know what they've
[37:51] done
[37:53] they said you left the word and you're
[37:55] out under the blood
[37:58] so we'll just put you under the blood of
[38:00] this church
[38:04] i mean
[38:05] i mean it now sure all right if any of
[38:08] you think that some of those churches
[38:09] back there you've been in you know like
[38:12] that you're
[38:14] in bad shape because you left them well
[38:16] we'll just have a comment after the
[38:19] service here today and you just come up
[38:21] and we'll just put you under the blood
[38:22] here
[38:25] i think you already are if you're saying
[38:27] this is your church home but i mean if
[38:29] you need it that's what we'll do because
[38:31] see i know what those little deceiving
[38:33] demons are
[38:34] they talk to you right
[38:38] like i've always said you you come to
[38:41] church
[38:42] you come to a sunday morning
[38:45] and the devil tells you you're feeling
[38:46] too bad
[38:49] you just don't need to go this morning
[38:51] just wait and go this evening
[38:57] it only happens to me every sunday
[38:59] morning
[39:03] all right
[39:09] so what do you do okay i do i feel bad
[39:11] i'm not going today
[39:16] so you're sitting there pity pattern in
[39:18] your little
[39:19] headed ways and saying well you know
[39:22] i didn't need to go because
[39:24] i feel bad
[39:29] i like the old two man sitting out on
[39:30] the
[39:31] creek bank fishing
[39:33] they heard the bell ringing into the
[39:35] church and
[39:36] one of them said
[39:39] well you know what i went to church
[39:41] today
[39:43] the other one said i couldn't go
[39:45] because my wife was sick
[39:51] but just about the time that you look at
[39:53] you watching
[39:55] ten o'clock
[39:57] that old demon don't say no more that
[39:59] you were sick
[40:02] he'll say
[40:03] see that you ain't a christian
[40:06] he was christian you'd win
[40:09] come on they don't talk to you that way
[40:13] did you could win you wasn't that sick
[40:17] so you ain't gonna win
[40:20] best way to deal with the devil just get
[40:21] up and leave
[40:24] i don't care what's wife or husband if
[40:25] you call him the devil either get up and
[40:28] leave him that's right
[40:30] go on right now
[40:32] move on with god
[40:33] oh i want to be a good little wife or a
[40:35] good husband when you die and go gonna
[40:37] help me that way too
[40:39] i know i'm my oh hateful dude
[40:43] but is it the truth
[40:49] see church what is a darkness
[40:55] brother brandon tried to talk to that
[40:57] girl one time about her salvation right
[41:00] the next time he seen her
[41:02] she offered him a drink or a smoke or
[41:04] something
[41:08] she said i could see
[41:10] my mother's soul
[41:12] frying in hell
[41:14] and life at her
[41:17] so that's how bad it's got brother brown
[41:25] now i'm not talking about back dark
[41:28] there was a dark age we'll get to it a
[41:29] little bit
[41:31] the middle age prophet calls it a torah
[41:37] a dark age
[41:40] you look at your church ages that was
[41:42] drawn out by the holy spirit and you'll
[41:44] see in that dark age the light was just
[41:46] almost gone
[41:48] just a little bit of light right
[41:52] why
[41:54] because of what the church had done
[41:56] right
[41:58] the thing that was supposed to be the
[42:00] savior
[42:01] the church
[42:04] became the crucifiers
[42:08] right
[42:13] it was
[42:14] it
[42:16] from them down to the ages there
[42:21] they killed a man because he believed in
[42:23] one god
[42:27] i've never understood that i'm as honest
[42:28] as i can be
[42:31] i've never understood mankind
[42:34] how that you could nail up you could
[42:35] take a man and put him in time to a post
[42:38] and build a fire around him and then
[42:40] turn around with a cross in your hand
[42:41] and say deny that god and the man looks
[42:45] at you and said
[42:46] i believe in jesus who do you believe in
[42:48] right
[42:49] i believe in jesus too
[42:52] i'm going to kill you because you
[42:54] believe in jesus because you won't
[42:55] accept murray
[42:58] as the mother of god
[43:00] right
[43:02] and that's something
[43:05] to kill right
[43:09] well what about a darkness
[43:14] i look around at this message people and
[43:16] i see people that
[43:20] they're gone into darkness
[43:24] because they will not in no way accept
[43:26] truth right
[43:32] come on
[43:33] they have a change
[43:35] truth is supposed to change us okay
[43:38] bringing it down to our day
[43:41] see that antichrist he had a bow with no
[43:43] arrows
[43:45] just a teaching it's a doctrine
[43:48] he was given a crown and become a pope
[43:53] and he went forth
[43:56] killing the people
[43:59] to make them serve god
[44:02] isn't that something
[44:06] in other words he wrote a decree
[44:09] well let's kill everybody today in a
[44:10] cabinet that one went over
[44:12] right yeah
[44:16] but look how how's how it looked
[44:20] don't you think it's better
[44:24] to make people serve god
[44:28] than to let them die and go to hell
[44:31] what do you mean who are you
[44:33] you think you
[44:35] you don't want people to go to heaven
[44:39] we've given you a way to do it
[44:45] you kill them
[44:49] you say yeah but we wouldn't back there
[44:51] we don't know
[44:55] there's plenty of books go ahead and
[44:57] read
[45:00] if you can stomach and read fox's book
[45:01] of martyrs all the way through right and
[45:03] one day you surely got i mean one doing
[45:06] you surely got a good stomach i ain't
[45:07] never been able to make it through
[45:12] cut babies out of mama's
[45:15] dunk
[45:16] and throw them to them
[45:18] pigs to eat
[45:21] all in the name of religion
[45:24] strap them down with an ox pulling one
[45:26] way and one pulling the other way
[45:28] and just rip them to pieces
[45:33] if you're going to kill at least do it
[45:34] sensibly and nice
[45:37] you know cut the guy's stroke
[45:41] that's the easiest way to kill somebody
[45:43] they say on this side over here there's
[45:45] a big vein you just whack that one and
[45:47] you're dead
[45:49] at least be humane
[45:55] i was reading one time about taking a
[45:58] a metal chair and building a fire under
[46:00] it
[46:02] taking people's clothes off women
[46:06] take their clothes off and strip them
[46:07] down and pour stuff all over this foxy
[46:10] book of martyr
[46:11] and take them and make them set down on
[46:13] that red-hot chair
[46:24] but those brothers my brother tell them
[46:27] they're good people
[46:32] well
[46:34] okay
[46:35] right
[46:36] what about it
[46:38] so let's start reading just a little bit
[46:40] now we've read these a lot of these i'll
[46:42] give them over to you over to you over
[46:43] to you we'll keep on giving them over to
[46:45] you too i don't want you to get the
[46:46] point
[46:47] what i want you to see if nothing else
[46:49] to see the same rider
[46:53] riding on the same horse
[46:54] and remember the horse doesn't stop
[46:57] right
[46:59] the writer gets off the white horse gets
[47:02] on the red one the prophet said that
[47:04] white horse goes all the way and strikes
[47:06] eternity
[47:09] that antichrist spirit is still here now
[47:16] the same one that started in genesis but
[47:18] still you're deceiving
[47:23] the horse don't stop yeah
[47:27] it just keeps on going
[47:29] the red horse he rides in it gets off
[47:31] the red gets on the bus the red one just
[47:33] rides right on
[47:37] the black the pale
[47:39] it's the same writer
[47:41] satan
[47:44] he said you're against him people and
[47:46] good people i'm not against nobody
[47:48] i'm against the devil and his control
[47:51] that he had upon mankind through
[47:54] religion
[47:56] amen all right
[47:58] we didn't come here for freedom of
[48:00] religion
[48:02] america wasn't established on freedom of
[48:04] religion
[48:06] is that was established on freedom from
[48:08] religion
[48:10] we came here to get away from religion
[48:18] we get the things that bound there come
[48:20] right all over and binding here right
[48:23] but now it's done through as i said
[48:26] we laughed at the catholics saying we're
[48:28] going to pray for grandma out of
[48:29] purgatory
[48:33] but then we come up to say well i go to
[48:35] church in the baptist methodist whatever
[48:37] because
[48:37] mama win is good enough for a mom that's
[48:40] good enough for me
[48:43] you think we still don't have that same
[48:45] ideas that they had
[48:50] catholics will tell you
[48:52] give me a child that's five years old
[48:54] and i'll always remain a catholic right
[48:58] that's how stunts they believe
[49:01] i say the new birth will change it but
[49:02] see
[49:04] they're putting it on the bases that the
[49:05] message is bad this presbyterian
[49:07] pentecostal can't change it
[49:09] i'm just come on
[49:18] but you see church
[49:22] the antichrist
[49:24] is still deceiving
[49:26] amen
[49:28] and you know where he's at in the pulpit
[49:32] who do you think he's got all this
[49:34] started and brother
[49:36] the preacher
[49:41] well how do we know whether you're right
[49:43] or not well what does the word say
[49:46] amen that's all i got to say about it
[49:50] ain't going to argue with you about
[49:51] whether i know i'm a dodeo aggravating
[49:55] dude
[49:57] but there's one thing about it you know
[49:58] i don't try to pull nothing over on you
[50:00] either
[50:01] i tell you like it is
[50:04] then you're gonna have to face god for
[50:06] the way it is
[50:08] if not you come and show me in the bible
[50:10] where i'm off all right
[50:12] amen
[50:13] i'll be glad to tap a sign right up here
[50:15] and i'm a false prophet
[50:18] show it to the world on the biggest
[50:19] internet system can be found
[50:22] if you can show me in the words where
[50:24] i'm wrong
[50:29] let's start out let's get something
[50:31] because what we've tried to keep this
[50:33] point before you
[50:35] see god is father son and holy ghost
[50:38] but satan you gotta have antichrist
[50:42] false prophet incarnate false prophets
[50:44] that's what's saying it pope
[50:47] and then
[50:48] the beast
[50:50] all right
[50:51] now
[50:53] keeping those things before us
[50:55] to where we'll understand it
[50:58] you remember joel said the cankerworm
[51:00] polyworm locust and the caterpillar
[51:03] all right
[51:06] that's the same thing as your your
[51:10] go to what is it can't get worm palm
[51:11] worm looks like it's four stages of one
[51:14] bug right
[51:15] right
[51:17] the bug goes through the cocoon he comes
[51:18] out of this he winds up being a
[51:20] butterfly he wind up being this and you
[51:22] know and then he just goes right back
[51:23] and makes it circle again
[51:26] because it's that's his stages it's the
[51:28] same old bug
[51:30] well that's the way it is with with
[51:31] satan
[51:34] you couldn't start out in that first
[51:35] church and say
[51:37] i'm going to take place of god
[51:40] no
[51:41] that wouldn't work
[51:44] but you've got to get the people to
[51:45] believe it that's right
[51:47] that's
[51:48] right now the catholics
[51:53] don't believe
[51:55] now listen
[51:56] that the pope is god
[51:59] you know the god of heaven right
[52:03] they believe that he's instead of god or
[52:05] in god's stead
[52:07] or in the place of god
[52:10] i'm not throwing off on them i'm just
[52:12] telling their doctrine right
[52:14] they believe that he is
[52:16] taking the place of god and if god has
[52:19] to transmit down
[52:21] something to earth he can use the pope
[52:23] to do it
[52:26] and he's elected you know like i said
[52:28] wednesday you let
[52:30] god all those bishops and things and
[52:33] ain't just one guy running right they
[52:35] have a whole bunch of them
[52:38] and then they elect who's going to be
[52:40] the one that god can come down and
[52:41] incarnate
[52:45] but it's the same stage
[52:49] but see can't warn palmer locust
[52:50] caterpillar restoration of rivalry but
[52:53] what does god do
[52:54] justification sanctification the baptism
[52:57] of the holy ghost and then the word
[52:59] that's right right
[53:01] man
[53:04] so he's fighting there's four horse
[53:06] riders
[53:07] in the book of revelation one through
[53:10] the first through the fourth seal
[53:12] these are
[53:13] forest rider on each one
[53:15] amen but there's also a combat beast
[53:18] yes sir right
[53:20] on each one
[53:22] that says come and see right
[53:25] now so look at it put it back up ready
[53:32] now go back to number one
[53:34] let me get to it
[53:37] he said i want you to notice the forward
[53:39] the mathematical one
[53:40] first antichrist white
[53:43] second false prophet red
[53:46] third parker of heaven and earth and
[53:49] purgatory
[53:50] black that's what we're gonna get onto
[53:52] today
[53:53] and the fourth is the beast hello horse
[53:57] satan being kicked out now that beast
[53:59] can't be until satan is kicked out of
[54:01] heaven that's right
[54:02] now if you think daniel's 70 weeks ain't
[54:04] important
[54:05] brother brown says you can't understand
[54:07] the seals
[54:09] unless you understand daniel 70 weeks
[54:11] okay now if you'll go to that book
[54:14] you'll find that he explains
[54:16] revelations
[54:18] 12
[54:20] in the daniel 70 week's book
[54:23] that's one of the things you can't
[54:24] understand so you see now where you'd be
[54:28] this nice one
[54:32] is going to be this evening we get to it
[54:34] he's going to be kicked out of heaven
[54:36] right
[54:37] amen
[54:39] but you know the bible says right now he
[54:41] can go before god
[54:44] come on the book of job read it
[54:47] said where you been
[54:49] he said i've been going through and
[54:50] throwing the earth
[54:52] he's talking to god
[54:55] the devil is
[54:57] right
[54:57] you know a lot of times i can't get an
[54:59] audience with god
[55:01] but the devil can sit up and talk to
[55:04] him know that would make us all upset
[55:10] but instead of being upset i know what
[55:11] he's doing
[55:13] he's using that old boy
[55:15] that's right
[55:17] he's using him to bring me amen he used
[55:20] that old boy to bring job down
[55:24] and get job down to where he would get
[55:26] out of his own self-righteousness and
[55:29] look up to god
[55:32] no
[55:33] satan you just keep on talking to him
[55:36] tell him all about how this hateful
[55:38] arrogant old dude
[55:42] just tell them all about how bad i am
[55:45] but you see one day he's to be cast out
[55:48] right well you know what's going to
[55:49] cause him to be cast out well that's
[55:51] this afternoon
[55:53] when the bride goes up
[55:55] he's cast out
[55:57] see when we go up he can't stay
[56:00] i love that he ain't going to be able to
[56:01] step forward when we knew that
[56:03] won't work would you see one comment
[56:05] first antichrist why exactly false
[56:08] prophet read third bikers of heaven
[56:10] earth in purgatory black fourth is the
[56:13] beast all right now jump to the next one
[56:17] try to get these fights
[56:19] all right
[56:21] do we ride on damn this is taken from
[56:23] the first seal of progress 322. here he
[56:25] is it's the antichrist he started riding
[56:27] in the first church age they ride them
[56:29] down on damn through every age
[56:32] watching he's riding
[56:34] he doesn't stop
[56:36] he keeps riding
[56:38] he's riding that horse all right
[56:40] see coming down
[56:42] it's the same rider all the time number
[56:44] three
[56:45] white horse we've seen what he's done
[56:48] perfectly here comes the red horse we
[56:49] see exactly what he's done here comes
[56:51] the black horse you see the same writer
[56:53] all the time what's he doing right on
[56:55] down through the ages
[56:56] when they get what i was saying want to
[56:58] go
[57:00] he comes up riding that by horse
[57:02] he gets off that horse gets on a red one
[57:04] that white horse just keeps right on
[57:06] going through the deception
[57:11] he gets onto the red you look around the
[57:13] world today over the name of religion
[57:15] and see how many people's being killed
[57:20] over the name of religion
[57:23] and i know i'm an american i believe in
[57:25] it
[57:27] but we go to a country like afghanistan
[57:29] or some of those countries iraq
[57:32] we go there to free the people
[57:35] from bondage of their religion
[57:38] right exactly right right all right
[57:42] we free those women to where they don't
[57:44] have to wear the veils anymore
[57:48] we turn them loose and let them become
[57:49] prostitutes on the street
[57:52] yeah are we really good people or what
[57:55] are we doing all right
[58:02] come on
[58:04] we go to africa and free the
[58:06] people when brother run said he was over
[58:09] there and said not one case of a narrow
[58:11] disease
[58:13] he said before they marry they've got to
[58:14] take emergency tests
[58:19] oh we freed them
[58:23] to become prostitutes
[58:28] i don't think you got to put a black
[58:29] veil over your face and drag your tracks
[58:32] out with a dress
[58:33] no
[58:35] but i think you ought to look right
[58:38] and dress diesel
[58:45] i've always said true blind
[58:49] where's language
[58:49] a barber she said
[58:51] there she is
[58:53] sister we used to talk about these
[58:55] religious people i told her one day i
[58:57] said sister barbara
[58:58] same women they just got their face
[59:00] covered
[59:04] you know
[59:05] you can't tell me that the face covered
[59:06] with the veil
[59:07] and the
[59:09] law saying if you do this or that other
[59:10] thing kill you that don't change
[59:12] thinking that's right
[59:14] it's just a different veil
[59:18] still doing it maybe you're not doing it
[59:20] out and open
[59:22] but still doing the same thing
[59:25] listen
[59:27] the different stages of satan's ministry
[59:31] the writer is the same it does not say
[59:34] white writer red writer
[59:36] black writer
[59:38] pale writer doesn't say that
[59:43] the man's the same he's the devil
[59:46] but when the horse comes in it's the
[59:48] symbol of what he's doing
[59:52] quite righteous
[59:54] very deceiving
[59:57] red
[59:58] killing united what probably said church
[1:00:02] and state
[1:00:03] he couldn't go out killing the first
[1:00:05] pope didn't go out kill him
[1:00:07] had to wait until constantine united
[1:00:09] church and
[1:00:13] and state they could take the pilot
[1:00:15] because like i said you go down here now
[1:00:17] kill a bunch of people while they arrest
[1:00:18] you
[1:00:19] but if you get the people behind you
[1:00:21] they want to arrest you
[1:00:23] you get the government behind you
[1:00:26] come on
[1:00:29] see the point i want you to see is
[1:00:33] some of you are catching on to what i'm
[1:00:35] trying to say
[1:00:38] because what you're doing is we've
[1:00:39] talked i have with some of you in
[1:00:41] discussion
[1:00:42] but you're not looking back there
[1:00:45] you're beginning to look here where we
[1:00:47] are now
[1:00:49] now that's a good idea
[1:00:51] it don't matter to me what has been
[1:00:54] that don't control me
[1:00:56] it's what it is
[1:01:00] that's why i say that i'm against the
[1:01:02] biggest portion of the minister to this
[1:01:04] message because they're not preaching
[1:01:06] the prophet's mission that's right
[1:01:09] they're not preaching salvation they're
[1:01:11] preaching a book of rules
[1:01:14] that's right believing a prophet
[1:01:16] you don't believe the prophets you're
[1:01:17] going to die go to hell
[1:01:19] if you don't believe jesus christ you're
[1:01:20] going to die
[1:01:22] if you believe jesus christ you're going
[1:01:24] to automatically be his problem right
[1:01:26] because you can't deny his prophet right
[1:01:28] and say that jesus christ is true if
[1:01:30] it's god's prophet right now
[1:01:32] that sensible all right
[1:01:36] see i don't have any words about it
[1:01:38] but she looked and seeing what we're
[1:01:40] doing now
[1:01:43] can you still see that writer and
[1:01:45] there's still a deception
[1:01:47] right
[1:01:51] preachers will come in i've seen them
[1:01:53] and you have to
[1:01:55] they'll be just preaching alone going
[1:01:57] real good everything goes real good and
[1:01:59] all at once
[1:02:01] right out of nowhere for no uncall for a
[1:02:03] reason
[1:02:12] richard says about aaron
[1:02:14] he gets off his
[1:02:16] one rabbit trail onto another
[1:02:18] one that's what he said about you know
[1:02:21] brother i didn't say that
[1:02:22] because i believed it
[1:02:27] because it's pretty good about us
[1:02:28] preachers we'll be going sometime and
[1:02:30] we'll just take off and go like hell
[1:02:32] that's not too bad
[1:02:33] that's off on rabbit train
[1:02:35] you can come back right
[1:02:37] but what i'm talking about is these
[1:02:38] preachers when it ain't got nothing to
[1:02:40] do with their sermon whatsoever and
[1:02:43] right in the middle of it
[1:02:45] have you seen that great revelation
[1:02:47] about jude and taymor oh my
[1:02:52] how that judah had a relationship with
[1:02:54] tamar and it brought that seed right
[1:02:56] down
[1:02:58] it didn't have anything to do with his
[1:02:59] message
[1:03:04] right
[1:03:05] now
[1:03:07] but you see he planted his seed right
[1:03:09] that's it
[1:03:11] you ever sat on a jury
[1:03:13] yes exactly right
[1:03:16] when the lawyer gets up here and he says
[1:03:18] so what's those said so and so on the
[1:03:20] judge said
[1:03:23] that's your say you can't bring that up
[1:03:25] in court
[1:03:27] strike that from the record
[1:03:30] you can't strike it out of the brain it
[1:03:32] was the people that hurt it
[1:03:35] he got his point across
[1:03:38] he planted the seed
[1:03:40] right out of what he does again or just
[1:03:42] bam erase that from the records
[1:03:46] i think that is point across right now
[1:03:49] that's what the preachers are doing
[1:03:52] they preach real good and i don't want
[1:03:54] you to see him go
[1:03:56] and then he jumps back
[1:03:58] especially they do here sometimes craw
[1:04:03] brother one time was preaching away here
[1:04:05] and he said something and i was gone i
[1:04:08] wouldn't hear
[1:04:09] but i certainly heard about it because
[1:04:11] he was preaching away on something all
[1:04:13] that once the whole church went
[1:04:16] right and he said what's wrong
[1:04:19] he's i say something wrong i'll just
[1:04:20] tell you what the prophet said well he
[1:04:22] wasn't telling what the prophecy
[1:04:24] that's why everybody shut up on him you
[1:04:26] know they set out on me
[1:04:29] i'm glad you did right
[1:04:31] he let him know a whole lot more what if
[1:04:32] i'd have told him he's wrong
[1:04:37] but you see people get their point
[1:04:38] across
[1:04:40] just a little saying
[1:04:43] right
[1:04:44] then here comes the young preachers
[1:04:46] alone
[1:04:48] right
[1:04:50] and they're just preaching judah and
[1:04:52] tamar and just all these doctrines like
[1:04:54] crazy
[1:04:58] and you say something to them about it
[1:05:00] well i just preached it called brother
[1:05:01] so much i was preaching right exactly
[1:05:04] right
[1:05:05] now you've got a doctrine
[1:05:09] right
[1:05:10] doctrine
[1:05:12] and he said well danny right
[1:05:15] well who are you
[1:05:17] you think you know everything
[1:05:21] no but i know somebody does yeah
[1:05:24] but do you think you know everything
[1:05:26] see they're killing you then right why
[1:05:28] because you kill a man's influence right
[1:05:31] come on
[1:05:33] are we still in the seals the a man's
[1:05:35] influences to kill the man
[1:05:39] you go out and kill my influence with
[1:05:41] people
[1:05:42] now i've said it straight
[1:05:44] and i mean it straight
[1:05:46] if i'm wrong and you tell people i'm
[1:05:48] wrong you're okay
[1:05:50] but if i'm right and you tell people i'm
[1:05:52] wrong you got a problem with god
[1:05:56] that's insane
[1:05:59] see but you kill my influence you kill
[1:06:00] me
[1:06:06] come on trying to bring them down the
[1:06:08] seals and things down the sense of
[1:06:09] simplicity of us thinking amen
[1:06:13] and you go out and won't hear nothing
[1:06:14] else
[1:06:16] you'll be like cain was
[1:06:19] kane said
[1:06:20] paraphrasing what he said he said god
[1:06:23] i've done all i'm going to do it's what
[1:06:27] your prophet said he said
[1:06:29] take it or leave it
[1:06:35] can't he never repented
[1:06:37] all right so he was saying before
[1:06:39] almighty god
[1:06:40] i'm not going to change
[1:06:42] he went into a blackness
[1:06:48] it would never be removed from him amen
[1:06:53] that curse follows him and his
[1:06:55] descendants all the way through
[1:06:59] all right
[1:07:02] what effect
[1:07:05] i'm asking you and me a simple question
[1:07:09] what effect does doctrines and ideas
[1:07:12] have upon us right
[1:07:15] sure
[1:07:18] what about it
[1:07:23] what effect does doctrines and ideas
[1:07:26] have upon us
[1:07:34] have you ever let an idea get in your
[1:07:36] mind
[1:07:38] and then you wouldn't even go to church
[1:07:42] maybe lay out a while or do something
[1:07:47] because some idea
[1:07:53] he said brother dylan you're talking
[1:07:55] about me
[1:07:57] bro mold had a good point the military
[1:07:59] they had a thing you military guys noted
[1:08:01] and he was crawling around on the ground
[1:08:03] out there and they had this barbed wire
[1:08:04] and stuff and you crawled around on it
[1:08:06] they had a gun that was firing live
[1:08:08] ammunition
[1:08:10] and it was right up over your head
[1:08:14] you know it's no problem as long as you
[1:08:16] didn't stand up
[1:08:20] right
[1:08:22] because it wasn't
[1:08:25] see if i say something to you and it
[1:08:26] offends you
[1:08:28] why what's the problem
[1:08:34] i'm gonna ask you is it the truth
[1:08:38] well you didn't present it right
[1:08:43] when jesus said you are of your father
[1:08:46] the devil
[1:08:48] he wasn't presenting that too much right
[1:08:50] to them either was it
[1:08:54] the truth is true
[1:08:57] what kind of effect does doctrines and
[1:08:59] ideas have to do on the things you and i
[1:09:02] what you hear like i've always told you
[1:09:04] i say nothing to you about you ask me
[1:09:07] can i listen to brother so-and-so's tell
[1:09:08] you yes
[1:09:11] you're welcome to listen to anybody you
[1:09:12] want to
[1:09:13] when you bring that thing back in this
[1:09:15] church that's right
[1:09:17] and i hear somebody start talking about
[1:09:19] it right
[1:09:20] i'm going to approach it from the pulpit
[1:09:23] right right and i'm going to tell you
[1:09:26] that that doctrine has no place here
[1:09:31] and if you don't like it you leave with
[1:09:33] it
[1:09:34] right because i'm going to be playing
[1:09:36] i'll try to be honest with you to say
[1:09:38] listen to people
[1:09:42] but let the holy spirit what's wrong
[1:09:45] that's right all right this is online i
[1:09:47] don't get it off i guess
[1:09:49] what's the matter why can't the holy
[1:09:51] spirit keep us straight right
[1:09:58] you got the holy ghost and it can't keep
[1:10:00] you straight
[1:10:10] you mean the holy spirit can't keep this
[1:10:12] thing no straighter than what it
[1:10:15] all is
[1:10:19] you mean there's
[1:10:21] 969 different denominations in the world
[1:10:24] that's a long time ago
[1:10:27] yeah there's about 2 000 in this message
[1:10:32] and the holy spirit can't keep it
[1:10:33] straight right
[1:10:38] there's something wrong somewhere
[1:10:41] my language go hateful dude somebody
[1:10:44] ain't got the holy ghost right
[1:10:46] all right
[1:10:49] you got the holy ghost you can't turn
[1:10:50] the word down now when it's first
[1:10:52] presented you might not like it
[1:10:54] when it's first said you might not agree
[1:10:56] wholeheartedly
[1:10:58] but if that holy ghost is inside of you
[1:11:00] you will somewhere line back up with
[1:11:02] that word
[1:11:05] neither you or anybody
[1:11:09] because you can't argue with the holy
[1:11:11] ghost is inside of you
[1:11:14] you ever heard somebody preaching and
[1:11:16] you didn't know what it was you stopped
[1:11:17] making something wrong

[1:11:45] i pray every day god lead me in the word

[1:12:28] say well really tried
[1:12:33] that old school
[1:12:34] teacher you read an old school teacher
[1:12:38] man they used to they just wear you out
[1:12:43] and you do something wrong
[1:12:45] but they didn't mind reaching getting
[1:12:47] you
[1:12:50] they didn't have to call home that's mom
[1:12:52] and dad if it's all right that's right
[1:12:54] that's the truth
[1:12:55] he knows when they send home words you
[1:12:57] got it you're gonna get it again
[1:13:02] wow why can't we see that in the gospel
[1:13:05] amen all right
[1:13:07] look why can't
[1:13:09] but listen church
[1:13:13] you remember what we were saying and
[1:13:15] i'll just do this go back through
[1:13:18] this one over this evening
[1:13:22] the same writer
[1:13:25] when it was once revealed to the prophet
[1:13:28] that that was the devil
[1:13:29] that antichrist he didn't say this the
[1:13:31] antichrist would say oh he just said
[1:13:33] antichrist no
[1:13:35] he said that was the devil
[1:13:38] in a deceptive form
[1:13:40] he knew that writer
[1:13:42] was not white
[1:13:44] and then
[1:13:45] right and then black and then pale
[1:13:48] he knew that it was the same old devil
[1:13:52] but it was different stages of his
[1:13:53] ministry the horse would signify the
[1:13:56] other things the boy and new arrows
[1:13:59] would signify
[1:14:00] the symbols right
[1:14:04] so he knew that that red horse rider was
[1:14:07] going to be telling him
[1:14:09] he knew that black horse rider is going
[1:14:10] to be the devil
[1:14:14] but as i told you they're on the second
[1:14:15] seal and it's on the third one he said
[1:14:19] i didn't know this until today
[1:14:25] you know what
[1:14:26] you know it was a devil oh he was a
[1:14:28] developer
[1:14:30] he didn't know the symbols
[1:14:34] what those symbols meant
[1:14:38] until that day
[1:14:42] he didn't see all of the seals unveiled
[1:14:44] with the first one but that's where i've
[1:14:46] always tried to get people to see it
[1:14:48] i asked you a question many many years
[1:14:51] ago
[1:14:53] i said which seal means the most to you
[1:14:57] some had
[1:14:59] the fourth don't have to feel somebody's
[1:15:01] sick someone just said what
[1:15:07] i see when that first seal broke to me
[1:15:09] then i had something
[1:15:11] i knew where i stood
[1:15:15] that's the most important seal of all is
[1:15:16] that first seal that's right
[1:15:20] once you see it's the antichrist then
[1:15:22] from then on it's just finding out what
[1:15:24] the symbols mean right amen right and
[1:15:26] what took place
[1:15:27] because it's already open to you
[1:15:30] he said well i like the four field six
[1:15:32] seven you don't know what they are if
[1:15:34] you don't go to the first
[1:15:38] come on i don't mind saying that that's
[1:15:40] right
[1:15:41] i've heard people preach the seals that
[1:15:43] way
[1:15:45] they just preach here and preach there
[1:15:47] but
[1:15:51] if that first seal don't break do you
[1:15:53] that's right
[1:15:54] you ain't gonna know what to sacrifice
[1:15:56] i'm sorry
[1:15:59] when it broke about the antichrist that
[1:16:00] prophet knew where he was standing
[1:16:03] in the end what he wanted was for god to
[1:16:05] speak each day and tell him the symbols
[1:16:08] right now when you get over to the fifth
[1:16:10] we're not going to get this probably for
[1:16:11] another couple of weeks
[1:16:13] but i've asked you to read you see a
[1:16:15] book
[1:16:16] you're supposed to be reading the third
[1:16:17] seal now
[1:16:19] and follow home by reading the fourth
[1:16:22] all right
[1:16:23] but when you get to the fifth seal
[1:16:24] there's no combat bit that's right
[1:16:30] but there's a key
[1:16:32] amen
[1:16:39] because there's a little phrase in that
[1:16:40] fourth seal
[1:16:44] that you better study on
[1:16:48] the combat beast on the four seals had
[1:16:50] come and see
[1:16:55] but that was not to calm that beast that
[1:16:58] screamed out touch not the oil and the
[1:17:01] wine
[1:17:05] that was god himself
[1:17:09] through the lamb
[1:17:11] i'm quoting brother brown
[1:17:13] maybe you'll get enough to go read it
[1:17:18] there's your key to why it's not a field
[1:17:19] six and seven
[1:17:24] why
[1:17:27] because god's come on the scene that's
[1:17:29] right
[1:17:31] if these seals don't bring god on the
[1:17:32] scene then what do we need the seals for
[1:17:35] everybody said well what do we need them
[1:17:36] for we don't need no i believe we need
[1:17:38] them but if it don't bring god on the
[1:17:40] scene we don't have them
[1:17:56] i'll just continue on this afternoon
[1:17:57] we'll
[1:17:58] make it part two of the third seal and
[1:18:01] move on from there
[1:18:05] but i hope you follow me
[1:18:07] for what i'm saying
[1:18:09] bring everything down here to where
[1:18:11] we're at
[1:18:15] the little deceiving ideas and thoughts
[1:18:18] that we have
[1:18:22] brother don't you think that brother has
[1:18:23] right believe what he wants to
[1:18:25] constitution says you can
[1:18:27] right
[1:18:29] the bible says no
[1:18:32] that's right
[1:18:34] show it to me in the bible you got to
[1:18:35] write believe what you want to do
[1:18:37] all right
[1:18:39] come on
[1:18:40] i'll put that thing around my next song
[1:18:42] false prophet bring it on show me this
[1:18:44] bible says it i can believe what i want
[1:18:46] to believe
[1:18:47] that's right eve said i think
[1:18:53] that's all she said wouldn't it
[1:18:57] come on
[1:18:58] and it caused all this death
[1:19:02] for her one little thought
[1:19:05] you think that we're going to go back
[1:19:07] with any of those talks
[1:19:10] what about it
[1:19:13] 539 response
[1:19:16] 39 to smartphone you might have any of
[1:19:17] the alters
[1:19:33] fear everybody
[1:19:41] me
[1:19:54] please
[1:20:11] is
[1:20:49] within me
[1:21:01] oh
[1:21:26] seeing ourselves
[1:21:50] we
[1:21:52] are
[1:22:10] me
[1:22:24] me
[1:22:41] me
[1:23:04] just think about it
[1:23:08] now i've got a word i want to say to you
[1:23:09] and i want you to take it correctly
[1:23:13] it's not just one sunday school class
[1:23:15] that we've had some problems with
[1:23:17] but the children not obeying and doing
[1:23:19] correctly
[1:23:20] and following the instructions
[1:23:24] back to them
[1:23:26] so now i'm saying to your parents
[1:23:29] don't think your goody little
[1:23:32] child is not guilty but you need to have
[1:23:35] a talk with your kids
[1:23:39] because
[1:23:42] sometimes kids get
[1:23:46] too smart for their own good
[1:23:50] we respect our elders we respect the
[1:23:52] teachers and the things
[1:23:53] that are here if not
[1:23:56] we will take you to your mother and
[1:23:58] father
[1:24:03] we see kids
[1:24:05] we do the best we can
[1:24:08] so you do the best you can
[1:24:11] you obey these people that are teaching
[1:24:13] you and don't argue back with them and
[1:24:14] fuss with them about something or ask
[1:24:16] them why is this and why is that
[1:24:23] just remember
[1:24:25] you're a child
[1:24:28] a teacher is a teacher
[1:24:32] so now i speak that in love to you
[1:24:34] children
[1:24:36] if things anymore we're going to just
[1:24:39] go to mom and daddy and have a little
[1:24:41] talk
[1:24:44] no you don't disrespect nobody
[1:24:47] school teachers even at school or
[1:24:49] whatever don't you do don't do it kids
[1:24:52] don't just don't
[1:24:54] don't fuss and argue with the school
[1:24:56] teacher yeah but that's wrong well
[1:24:59] that's part of your growing
[1:25:03] part of your growing period
[1:25:05] right they're doing the best they can
[1:25:07] they try
[1:25:11] but most of you won't do what i doing
[1:25:13] one day we got word something about
[1:25:15] terence there
[1:25:17] he was in the eighth grade
[1:25:19] principal sent home a report
[1:25:22] on the report i've read it and what did
[1:25:23] i understand it said check student's
[1:25:26] folder when i thought it meant he was in
[1:25:28] somebody else's
[1:25:30] folder looking around that was just what
[1:25:31] i thought it meant
[1:25:33] i called the principal and said i want
[1:25:34] to know
[1:25:37] he said no he said sam said i found out
[1:25:39] later said terence and this boy in his
[1:25:42] class
[1:25:43] it wasn't too bad what they were doing
[1:25:45] said probably shouldn't even come to the
[1:25:46] office but said these other boys was in
[1:25:49] bad shape
[1:25:50] and said they were really needed to be
[1:25:52] rebuked and said i put them all in
[1:25:54] together
[1:25:54] and rebuked them i said
[1:25:57] you're welcome thank you
[1:25:59] take care of them they need whipping you
[1:26:02] take care of it
[1:26:04] he said i wish all parents was like that
[1:26:06] but i can't do it i said yeah but the
[1:26:08] only thing i thought if he was doing
[1:26:10] something and he shouldn't have done
[1:26:11] looking in somebody else's material then
[1:26:13] i'd take care of it but you've taken
[1:26:14] care of it so
[1:26:16] if you have any more trouble let me know
[1:26:21] you see what most of your parents would
[1:26:23] do if principal called you up and told
[1:26:25] you you're kidding
[1:26:26] my kid don't dis don't like that
[1:26:31] you are to see
[1:26:34] that's as plain as i can say it

[1:26:46] are kids
[1:26:48] and no matter what
[1:26:50] they're going to be kids
[1:26:52] and some of you ought to remember where
[1:26:55] you come from because you was a kid
[1:26:59] at one time
