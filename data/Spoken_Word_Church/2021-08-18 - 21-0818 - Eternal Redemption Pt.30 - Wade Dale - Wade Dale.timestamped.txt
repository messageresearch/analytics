[6:03] well don't scare me like that
[6:06] hey man
[6:09] a couple of announcements and then we'll
[6:10] get started
[6:12] wonderful time
[6:14] everybody's all
[6:17] frustrated about the goings on to the
[6:19] world and
[6:20] we just keep going on
[6:23] listen we can't stop we got to keep
[6:24] moving
[6:25] there is no way
[6:27] that we're defeated
[6:29] there is no way that we don't win
[6:32] there is no scripture that says we lose
[6:36] amen every scripture i read says we've
[6:38] already won
[6:40] so we just got to come to that
[6:43] and i want to read you this quote that
[6:44] brother bob um
[6:46] sent
[6:46] me and the message why in 1961 now they
[6:50] won't have it but go ahead and pull it
[6:51] down
[6:52] the prophet of god says oh yes
[6:55] they got real men in there and they got
[6:57] some renegades too
[7:00] and don't holler at them because we got
[7:02] some others renegades that call
[7:03] themselves reverend
[7:06] that's exactly right so sauce for the
[7:07] goose is for the gander
[7:10] yes sir a man's got toxin and salt
[7:13] vaccine is for these little children and
[7:15] now polio
[7:16] i pray daily that god will send us
[7:19] something for cancer
[7:21] this is a prophet
[7:22] all right listen to this if we can't
[7:25] have faith let's get something else
[7:29] faith is the first
[7:31] let's take the next best if we can't get
[7:34] that
[7:35] now this is the prophet 1961. we still
[7:37] believe what he says right
[7:39] it's not one of these that we believe it
[7:41] because we want to and then we throw
[7:42] them out because we don't like it
[7:44] all right
[7:45] look at the world and the condition it's
[7:47] in poor suffering humanity
[7:50] help everybody you can
[7:53] everything that helps is of god
[7:57] let's help let's do everything we can
[8:00] and pray for men
[8:01] how many of you prayed more in the past
[8:03] month two months than you've ever prayed
[8:04] in your life if you hadn't then you're
[8:06] not a christian
[8:07] amen
[8:09] let's do everything we can to pray for
[8:10] men the things to do brother is get our
[8:12] arms together
[8:14] both medicine
[8:15] doctors
[8:16] hospitals
[8:18] nurses
[8:19] church and all together and put our
[8:21] faith in god and move forward
[8:25] that's what we need god's going to ask
[8:27] us why we didn't do it
[8:30] some of these days
[8:32] god's going to ask us well why didn't we
[8:34] do that but brother ryan says look faith
[8:36] is first
[8:37] but lest if you can't have that let's
[8:39] take the next best thing if you can't
[8:40] get to that
[8:42] so the question that that you know we're
[8:44] talking about and
[8:45] and you know you
[8:47] uh
[8:48] my blood pressure has been high still
[8:50] for the past week and you kind of feel
[8:51] bad and
[8:52] and you don't even have anything for it
[8:54] but you know what if i had a pill there
[8:55] i'd take it
[8:57] to feel better
[8:59] i do have faith
[9:00] you have faith
[9:03] but when you've got a headache i know we
[9:04] pray but when the headache keeps getting
[9:06] bigger and bigger and bigger what do we
[9:08] do
[9:09] we take an aspirin
[9:10] right
[9:11] so
[9:12] i'm just telling you that that we need
[9:14] to
[9:16] just stand back and look at what's going
[9:18] on
[9:18] we do have faith
[9:21] we do have faith
[9:23] i believe every time i come up here to
[9:26] this pulpit that god's going to heal
[9:28] somebody
[9:30] spiritually or naturally either one i
[9:33] hope spiritually first
[9:35] but also naturally and we've seen it
[9:36] done a few times where the people would
[9:39] come up after service and they'd say hey
[9:40] i was you were preaching and i was
[9:43] praying and
[9:44] my back quit hurting or this quit
[9:45] hurting or that quit hurting and that's
[9:47] the way it should be the gentile way
[9:48] same thing in the world when i go to the
[9:50] doctor tomorrow i want y'all to pray
[9:52] that he finds what's going on
[9:54] because you know what i can't look
[9:55] inside my body
[9:58] and god give us this body to live in so
[9:59] i'm going tomorrow to see what's going
[10:01] on with this blood pressure
[10:03] that i've never had a problem with ever
[10:05] in my entire life ever had a problem
[10:07] with it
[10:08] so we'll
[10:12] like dad always says
[10:13] take the doctor's program
[10:15] but we're going to anoint it with oil
[10:18] and we're going to we're going to pray
[10:20] for that
[10:21] whatever we take the aspirin the blood
[10:23] pressure medicine anxiety whatever you
[10:25] take somebody everybody in this building
[10:27] takes something
[10:28] or has taken something
[10:30] okay
[10:31] so let's have faith
[10:34] you know brother branham said god gave
[10:35] the
[10:37] uh ability for jonah salt to get that
[10:39] vaccine so it could cure polio why
[10:41] didn't he just pray for everybody to get
[10:42] rid of polio
[10:43] because there's things in our body that
[10:45] we need to get rid of immunities that we
[10:46] need to build up so i'm not saying this
[10:48] for anything i just love that quote that
[10:50] brother bob found for us and um
[10:53] brother brown knows that we're human
[10:54] beings
[10:55] and if we had super duper faith we'd
[10:57] already be in the rapture
[10:59] amen but we got to carry it from the
[11:01] toothache though like you said we got a
[11:02] carrot from the toothache and carried on
[11:05] there's going to be a day when we're
[11:07] going to stand in eternity and i believe
[11:09] it's going to be made known to us
[11:12] what we didn't get
[11:17] how much we've messed with this world
[11:19] and i don't mean that you know mingled
[11:20] with the world all the
[11:23] whatever you want to say you get on your
[11:25] hands or you get on this or you get on
[11:27] that that god has protected you from
[11:30] he put an immunity in your body but he
[11:32] also gave you five senses to use that
[11:34] those five senses so let's use those
[11:36] five
[11:37] sentences
[11:38] and go from there but just pray for me
[11:40] tomorrow i'm gonna go to the my primary
[11:42] physician and see what uh
[11:44] see what's going on so you just pray
[11:46] i told them i've had every test except
[11:48] for a few and
[11:50] they've all turned out well so
[11:52] we're just praying that the lord will
[11:53] reveal to the doctor what's going on
[11:56] and
[11:57] and it will be
[11:59] that will be made whole so you just pray
[12:01] for me tomorrow at 11 o'clock
[12:03] and also brother aaron you will be
[12:04] preaching next wednesday which will be
[12:06] the 25th
[12:08] remember september the 25th we're going
[12:10] to have our youth service with brother
[12:12] andrew glover keep that in prayer
[12:14] and also some of you have said you can
[12:16] play we can go do putt-putt on saturday
[12:19] some said you can't go sunday
[12:22] i haven't had anybody say they couldn't
[12:23] go on saturday but i've had a few said
[12:25] they couldn't go on sunday afternoon so
[12:28] would saturday be okay if we tried to
[12:30] get it at like five o'clock or
[12:32] or so or six on saturday or earlier
[12:37] so we're gonna today we need to vote
[12:39] saturday or sunday saturday raise your
[12:41] hand
[12:43] sunday raise your hand we're going
[12:45] saturday
[12:48] popular vote sorry
[12:51] but we'll try to figure that out and
[12:52] figure out a date it will not be next
[12:54] saturday it'll be in the future so you
[12:57] can arrange
[12:58] a time to be off had you'd rather do it
[13:00] early in the day or later in the day
[13:03] early in the day
[13:04] like say 12 1 that's hottest day of the
[13:07] you know hot time brother direct's going
[13:09] no
[13:10] no
[13:11] so maybe six o'clock five o'clock
[13:14] because i think what we'll do is we'll
[13:15] we'll get some pizza or we'll eat later
[13:17] we'll do something to eat and then we'll
[13:18] play putt-putt for a couple hours that
[13:20] okay we'll do that on a saturday then
[13:22] all right well we'll figure that out and
[13:24] let you know
[13:25] um
[13:26] all of you that want to go all right and
[13:29] we'd like for everybody to to go so
[13:31] let's go to hebrews 9 11.
[13:35] and let's continue our thought i'm going
[13:37] to back up a little bit from sunday i
[13:38] kind of flew through if you noticed i
[13:40] was flying through because it was hot
[13:43] so we're going to back up just a little
[13:44] bit and i saw a few things that i want
[13:46] to
[13:48] bring a point in about the tribulation
[13:51] and then we'll
[13:53] we'll probably not get to the millennium
[13:54] until this weekend coming up because the
[13:56] millennia listen the millennium is a
[13:58] complex issue because
[14:00] there are scriptures that covers both
[14:02] the millennium
[14:04] and the future home
[14:06] but now some of them only covers the
[14:09] millennium
[14:11] only covers the future home they're
[14:13] separate
[14:14] because we're going to read we won't
[14:15] read tonight but remember in the
[14:17] millennium they will build and inhabit
[14:20] and not give it to somebody else
[14:23] now remember the future home is that's
[14:24] not the future home
[14:26] that future home is built for me and you
[14:29] already in another dimension and it's
[14:32] going to come into view and come down
[14:33] into heaven and from heaven to earth and
[14:36] it's going to be according to your
[14:37] desire so you're building it but you're
[14:39] not physically building it like you will
[14:41] do in the millennium now we will not in
[14:43] the millennium but the jews will
[14:46] everybody got that
[14:47] it is a jewish 1000 years it is not for
[14:50] the bride
[14:51] we're there on a honeymoon now think
[14:53] about that when you go on a honeymoon
[14:54] what do you do you rest you enjoy your
[14:57] your spouse you have a good time you you
[15:00] want to just settle down because you
[15:01] know the cares of life is going to hit
[15:03] you when you get to the end when you get
[15:04] to the end of it all right but now not
[15:06] that way when we get to the millennium
[15:08] then we see the future home coming so
[15:10] listen the millennium is not to me and
[15:11] you but it is important that we know
[15:13] what's there
[15:15] when we get there all right
[15:17] so let's bow our heads dear heavenly
[15:18] father thank you for this day that you
[15:19] give us
[15:20] i pray now lord
[15:22] for this journey
[15:23] forgive us our faults and mistakes and
[15:25] our ideas that are against you
[15:27] lord we pray for the ones that are sick
[15:29] lord the ones that have the
[15:30] that the seems like the kovid's coming
[15:32] back into some of the churches father i
[15:33] pray that you keep it away from this one
[15:35] lord
[15:36] we pray in the mighty name of jesus
[15:38] christ that you'll cover us lord by your
[15:39] blood you said you would
[15:41] you said whatever we ask believing that
[15:43] you would give to us lord so we are
[15:44] believing we're having faith lord that
[15:47] you'll take care of this little
[15:48] sanctuary that we have here of people
[15:51] that when we go out in the world truly
[15:52] we'll see
[15:54] i believe when we get to that future
[15:56] home
[15:57] it'll be told how many times that we
[15:59] were almost at death's door
[16:01] or something almost happened
[16:03] lord that saved our life and father
[16:06] by your providence we're here lord
[16:08] and as we're going to speak in a few
[16:09] minutes there's got to be an alive and
[16:12] remain on this earth
[16:14] to fulfill that scripture father and
[16:16] that means there is no death
[16:18] in that person father we pray that you
[16:20] just give us that revelation may it be a
[16:22] not be a mystery anymore the mystery
[16:24] will become history as the prophet of
[16:26] god said
[16:27] just bless us now give us revelation
[16:29] more than anything in the world we love
[16:31] you lord with all of our heart and we
[16:33] pray that we'll all continue up that
[16:35] mountain called the statue of a perfect
[16:36] man father just bless our pastor keep
[16:38] him strong give him strength give us all
[16:40] strength lord to make it through the
[16:42] times and the hours that we're living
[16:43] father we pray in jesus name
[16:45] amen
[16:47] just cover me tomorrow
[16:50] how many of you all had blood pressure
[16:51] problems
[16:54] man it ain't fun
[16:57] i i'm with you now i can now i can groan
[17:00] with you
[17:01] man
[17:02] and your face feels like it's about to
[17:03] fall off of course mine it could and it
[17:05] wouldn't bother anything
[17:06] but uh top of your head gets all hot and
[17:09] your arm starts hurting and
[17:12] devil
[17:13] because it's lie but christ being coming
[17:15] high priest of good things to come by a
[17:17] greater more perfect tabernacle not made
[17:19] with hands that is to say not of this
[17:21] building neither by the blood of goats
[17:23] and calves but by his own blood he
[17:24] entered and once into the holy place
[17:26] having obtained eternal redemption
[17:29] for us let's read the lev revelations 11
[17:31] 3
[17:32] and i give power unto my two witnesses
[17:35] they shall prophesy how long one
[17:37] thousand two hundred and three score
[17:39] days clothed in sackcloth
[17:41] and then we know we'll we'll read the
[17:43] rest of it that happens we may be seated
[17:45] now we've been talking about i want to
[17:47] go back to this one thing go ahead and
[17:49] pull up matthew 16. this was really
[17:51] striking i was reading a commentary by
[17:54] scofield this week
[17:58] and this struck me because remember
[17:59] we've read the quote several times that
[18:02] brother brown said in the feast of the
[18:04] trumpets said he's been revealed to the
[18:05] church ages now to the church ages as
[18:08] the son of god is that right
[18:10] amen so let's read matthew 16 verse 15.
[18:12] i want you to see something that
[18:14] i bet you didn't know
[18:17] and i'm fixing to tell you
[18:19] he says unto them
[18:21] i'll get them before they fall asleep
[18:22] bob so you've got to get them you got to
[18:24] pale
[18:26] he saith unto them but whom say ye that
[18:29] i am now remember they said he was this
[18:30] he was a prophet he was a good man he
[18:32] was this he was that he said but
[18:35] i want to know what you think
[18:37] and peter spoke up and said thou art the
[18:39] christ
[18:41] the son of the living god now remember
[18:43] he asked who god the son of man am he
[18:45] answered to the son of god but listen
[18:46] watch and jesus answered and said unto
[18:48] him blessed art thou simon barjona for
[18:51] flesh and blood hath not revealed it
[18:52] unto thee but my father which is in
[18:54] heaven in other words simon peter tapped
[18:57] into something
[18:58] that he needed for a future event
[19:00] because he was getting ready to get the
[19:02] keys to the kingdom
[19:04] all right so now watch though and i say
[19:06] unto thee
[19:07] thou art peter and upon this rock now we
[19:11] we know what that rock is it's not peter
[19:14] it's not the church
[19:16] it's a revelation but watch
[19:18] and upon this rock i will build my
[19:22] church
[19:25] and the gates of hell shall not prevail
[19:26] against it do you know that's the first
[19:28] time the word church is spoken in the
[19:31] bible
[19:32] it's spoken 145 times after that 144 but
[19:36] that's the first time and jesus is
[19:39] saying i will build my church on that
[19:42] revelation
[19:43] now we know that the revelation that we
[19:45] get is that that that is not his church
[19:48] is not out there
[19:50] his church is not a building
[19:52] his church is a body of believers called
[19:55] the bride
[19:56] but it took a prophet in the end time to
[19:58] come and tell us i don't call you church
[20:01] anymore i call you bride because you've
[20:02] come out of the church
[20:04] come out of her my people
[20:07] amen and but upon this rock i will build
[20:10] my church so listen
[20:12] now let's read the feast of the trumpets
[20:13] what did he build his church on
[20:16] not the revelation of the son of man
[20:19] he built that church on the revelation
[20:21] of the son of god that god the holy
[20:23] ghost was going to come back on the day
[20:25] of pentecost and was going to indwell a
[20:27] group of people they were going to go
[20:29] all over the world and preach the gospel
[20:33] the acceptable year of the lord you know
[20:35] in luke 4 there when he talks he says i
[20:38] have been anointed to do this and and
[20:40] preach the acceptable yield of the lord
[20:41] remember he stopped
[20:43] you know that's a comma
[20:45] that comma is me and you because in
[20:48] other words after that it says then
[20:50] bring judgment
[20:51] so see that goes all the way over to the
[20:54] tribulation that we're going to talk
[20:55] about here in just a minute but that
[20:57] little comma is me and you because he
[20:58] stopped
[21:00] because upon this rock i'll build my
[21:02] church
[21:04] the revelation of the son of god
[21:07] not the revelation of the son of man
[21:09] now he's been revealed through the
[21:10] church ages now watch through the church
[21:12] ages that son of god god being a spirit
[21:15] the holy spirit
[21:16] he revealed himself in the church age as
[21:18] in the congregation as the holy spirit
[21:21] among the people
[21:23] now
[21:24] most of them as even paul
[21:26] paul would say and i'll i'm not going to
[21:28] read it i'll paraphrase it paul says
[21:31] it's better to be absent from the body
[21:33] and present with god
[21:36] you know what he said
[21:38] but to fulfill it's the same
[21:41] paul
[21:42] that said we which are alive and remain
[21:46] you see what he's talking about
[21:48] he's got he really wants to be with the
[21:50] lord and i know we really want to be
[21:52] with the lord
[21:54] but somebody's got to press their way
[21:56] through this thing
[21:57] and not die
[22:00] to fulfill that scripture
[22:02] now some people are going to fulfill
[22:04] this one
[22:05] that it's better to be present in the
[22:07] body than absent with the lord
[22:09] right
[22:10] that's what he said but i had rather be
[22:12] present with the lord and absent from
[22:13] the body but he said it's expedient that
[22:15] i stay here he had to stay until his
[22:17] work was over then he could leave
[22:20] so through the church ages
[22:22] as the baptism of the holy ghost
[22:25] even from paul
[22:27] to now almost now
[22:30] people believe they got to die everybody
[22:33] is born to die
[22:36] this is kind of what i want to bring out
[22:38] we we talk about the son of man we're
[22:39] going to go back on the son of man but
[22:40] look at the son of man look at the
[22:42] difference the son of man though
[22:44] has already died
[22:47] buried
[22:49] resurrected himself it didn't take
[22:51] somebody to resurrect him he resurrected
[22:52] himself he said you destroy this temple
[22:54] i'll raise it up in three days what man
[22:56] can say that no one could say that
[22:58] amen
[22:59] and then he came back on the day of
[23:01] pentecost as the baptism of the holy
[23:03] ghost but there was a peace there that
[23:05] was missing
[23:09] it had to be told in the end time
[23:12] because the son of god was where i will
[23:14] build my church or i will build my bride
[23:17] on the revelation of the son of god
[23:20] but right at the at the end time there's
[23:22] got to be a mystery
[23:25] paul said behold i show you a mystery we
[23:27] shall not all sleep
[23:28] now listen if you talk to any
[23:30] denomination
[23:31] uh we were talking about this today me
[23:32] and somebody oh me and brother russ was
[23:34] talking about
[23:35] on the phone
[23:36] every denomination talk to him
[23:39] talk to him and say hey man we're going
[23:41] to be alive when the rapture takes place
[23:43] and they'll go
[23:45] no we all got to die
[23:48] and we all got to go for judgment
[23:51] no you don't
[23:54] you might fulfill with that scripture
[23:56] but the fulfillment of the scripture i'm
[23:58] looking at is that we which are alive
[24:00] and remain the revelation of the son of
[24:02] man because he's already died been
[24:04] buried resurrected went to heaven
[24:07] has a glorified body and promised us
[24:09] that we would have one
[24:11] and paul caught the revelation
[24:14] and he wasn't there when jesus said i
[24:16] will build my church and the gates of
[24:18] hell shall not prevail against it he
[24:20] wasn't there but he caught the
[24:21] revelation that that church was the
[24:24] bride of jesus christ
[24:26] and there would be in the end time we
[24:28] which are alive and remain
[24:30] to the coming of the lord so that's
[24:32] where me and you are at
[24:33] and
[24:37] just by and i don't want to do it you
[24:39] know you say well throw those scriptures
[24:40] out you can't throw them out they've all
[24:42] got a piece together
[24:44] but somebody's not going to die
[24:47] somebody's going to come to a place that
[24:50] death has been destroyed while you're
[24:53] standing in a body that your mom and
[24:55] daddy produced
[24:58] that's what this message is all about
[25:01] sure this message is going to bring us
[25:02] salvation and redemption but eternal
[25:05] redemption in our body spirit and soul
[25:07] is what
[25:08] this message is all about that's why
[25:10] this message is different than all the
[25:12] other messages
[25:13] you had a prophet stand one day and he
[25:15] said
[25:16] you're not all gonna die well paul died
[25:20] even the prophet that said it died
[25:24] but there's got to be a group of people
[25:26] fulfill that scripture
[25:28] it's got to be fulfilled you can't skip
[25:30] over it can't go around it you've got to
[25:32] sign somebody to fulfill it and i just
[25:33] contest that we are the ones
[25:35] that are going to do it
[25:37] luke 17 verse 24 for as a lightning that
[25:40] line us out of one part under heaven and
[25:42] shineth unto the other part so shall
[25:44] also the son of man be in his day
[25:46] who can who can tell me where lightning
[25:48] starts from oh it starts in a cloud give
[25:50] me the exact point
[25:53] can't
[25:55] give me the exact point that it lands
[25:57] cain it bounces everywhere that's the
[25:59] same way
[26:01] no one's going to understand
[26:03] this
[26:05] mystery of the son of man
[26:10] now look this is him this is the person
[26:14] like i said before so shall the son of
[26:15] man be in his day
[26:18] did they know who jesus was they're
[26:19] stood the son of man he was trying to
[26:20] tell him the whole time this is i'm the
[26:22] son of man the lightning was standing in
[26:24] front of them
[26:26] where it where it emanated from and
[26:28] where it came back to
[26:30] and they didn't see him well you know
[26:31] what same way with me and you
[26:33] even the christians of his day hated him
[26:36] because he said who he was
[26:38] they hated him because he said i'm the
[26:40] son of man they understood that he was a
[26:42] little bit different
[26:44] because remember they read ezekiel
[26:46] jeremiah
[26:48] all the ones lamentations prophesy son
[26:51] of man
[26:52] prophesy son of man
[26:55] not son of god son of man and we keep
[26:57] telling them i'm the son of man i'm the
[27:00] son of man that's come to save the world
[27:01] and they're like
[27:03] wait a minute
[27:05] where's this guy where did he come from
[27:09] and where is he going
[27:11] that was what i was trying to get back
[27:12] up a little bit
[27:14] that i kind of skipped over sunday
[27:17] so shall it be in the s when the son of
[27:20] man be in his day but now look we got to
[27:22] continue down because look but first he
[27:24] must suffer many things and be rejected
[27:26] of his generation we know that that was
[27:28] isaiah 53 he was what rejected of his
[27:30] own people
[27:32] who shall declare his generation well
[27:34] obviously the jews didn't we're
[27:35] declaring his generation because he had
[27:37] to put them away so verse 26 as it was
[27:40] in the days of noah
[27:41] so shall be also in the days of the son
[27:43] of man what were they doing they did eat
[27:46] they
[27:47] raise the donut please
[27:50] they drank they married wives they were
[27:52] given in marriage until the day that
[27:54] noah entered the ark and the flood came
[27:56] and destroyed them all
[27:58] it was a lawless generation that grew up
[28:02] without god
[28:03] the whole world
[28:06] is that not what's going on right now
[28:11] but god promised he wouldn't destroy it
[28:13] with water
[28:15] he's going to destroy it with atomic
[28:16] fire
[28:18] amen
[28:19] because he's not going to destroy it
[28:22] anymore by the flood because he said he
[28:23] wouldn't
[28:25] likewise also it was in the days of what
[28:28] now when the days of light see we come
[28:29] up now to our day
[28:32] we had a we had a
[28:34] a melchizedek god in human flesh
[28:37] went and talked to a prophet
[28:39] that familiar
[28:41] talked to a prophet
[28:43] we had two witnesses or two prophets
[28:45] minor prophets
[28:46] that went to sodom and gomorrah and
[28:48] blinded their eyes billy graham or
[28:51] roberts so see we're right here in this
[28:53] scripture all of us are
[28:55] likewise also it was in the days of what
[28:57] they did the same thing
[28:59] they eat they drank they bought they
[29:00] sold
[29:01] they planted they built it
[29:03] some of y'all's doing we've done that
[29:05] all most of them
[29:07] all of our life
[29:09] but the same day that lot went out of
[29:11] sodom it ran fire and brimstone from
[29:13] heaven and destroyed them all even thus
[29:15] shall it be in the day
[29:17] when the son of man is revealed
[29:20] now said the coming of the son of man
[29:22] this is the revealing of the son of man
[29:25] amen there's a difference in his coming
[29:27] and his appearing
[29:29] listen
[29:30] he can be here and nobody know him but
[29:33] somebody that's got a revelation
[29:36] that's what i contend we are in the day
[29:38] of the son of man now and only a few
[29:40] people are going to get it
[29:42] and that's not negating that you don't
[29:45] have the holy ghost because that's the
[29:46] son of god revelation
[29:50] believe on the lord jesus christ and
[29:51] thou shalt be saved
[29:54] you must be born again but then there's
[29:56] growth development there's something you
[29:58] got to do you got to continue on and
[29:59] continue on
[30:01] and then when we see
[30:03] the revealing of the son of man now
[30:06] who is it revealed to
[30:10] me and you
[30:11] it is not revealed to the world
[30:15] no one in the world will know just as
[30:17] the lightning went from here to there
[30:19] and just as he stood on earth declared
[30:21] who he was
[30:24] man there's something that that i'm
[30:26] going to bring and let some let you read
[30:28] where scofield
[30:30] now he's proven who the messiah is and
[30:32] he takes it all through scripture
[30:35] brings it all the way down
[30:37] and pinpoints right down he said it's
[30:39] got to come from judah yes
[30:42] right got to come from judah the
[30:44] lawgiver
[30:46] it's got to be born in bethlehem that's
[30:48] what the bible says
[30:49] god be born a virgin
[30:51] it just he said it just keeps now that
[30:52] funnel keeps narrowing down
[30:55] to only just a few people that was born
[30:56] in bethlehem during that time
[30:59] so here we are you don't have to prove
[31:01] it to us but
[31:02] it's like the jews you see how far they
[31:04] missed it
[31:05] they were reading those old testament
[31:07] scriptures
[31:08] that he would be born in bethlehem
[31:10] this would happen and this would happen
[31:12] and this would happen and there's the
[31:13] star
[31:15] and there's the wise men
[31:17] and they still said uh
[31:19] illegitimate child
[31:21] right
[31:22] well same thing they're saying me to you
[31:24] illegitimate children they just don't
[31:26] know what they don't fit over here and
[31:28] they don't fit over there they just i
[31:30] don't care you can call me whatever you
[31:31] want to as long as god calls me a child
[31:33] in his i don't care what the world calls
[31:35] him
[31:36] amen
[31:37] but so who's the son of man going to be
[31:39] revealed to a funneling a very small
[31:42] amount of people is going to get the
[31:44] true revelation of who this son of man
[31:47] is
[31:47] so now let's go to first corinthians 15.
[31:50] let's read this behold
[31:53] paul behold
[31:55] i show you a mystery we shall not all
[31:57] sleep
[31:59] but we shall all be changed
[32:02] in a moment in the twinkling of an eye
[32:03] the last trump for the trumpet shall
[32:04] sound we know it's not a to do to do
[32:07] it's a message
[32:09] and the dead in christ shall rise be
[32:12] raised what incorruptible
[32:14] and we shall be changed for this
[32:16] corruptable must put on incorruption and
[32:18] this mortal must put on immortality
[32:21] listen that is a promise
[32:24] that you're mortal
[32:28] you're corruptable
[32:29] sorry
[32:34] if you're going to be raised
[32:35] incorruptible you've got to have been
[32:36] corruptible at one time
[32:40] for this corruptable must put on
[32:42] incorruption and this mortal must put on
[32:44] immortality
[32:46] right
[32:48] now look
[32:51] the other scripture that i took off was
[32:53] we which are alive and remain to the
[32:54] coming of the lord shall what
[32:56] shall not prevent or hinder those which
[32:57] are asleep now the alive and remain and
[33:00] this mystery is not a mystery of who the
[33:03] son of god is
[33:06] the live and remain is not a mystery who
[33:08] the son of god is it's a mystery of who
[33:10] the son of man is
[33:12] and then the brother brown said the
[33:13] bride of jesus christ is the son of man
[33:15] in the end time as a collective body not
[33:18] one person
[33:19] amen
[33:20] am i all right with that
[33:22] because listen we're not virgin born so
[33:24] we're not the son of man
[33:26] these son of man had to be virgin born
[33:28] and that negates all of us all right
[33:30] so there you go you narrow it down again
[33:33] but by the transforming power of the
[33:35] lord jesus christ
[33:37] he called us the son of man in the end
[33:38] time through a prophet
[33:40] so let's start living it
[33:42] all right revelations 4 1 says look
[33:44] after this i looked and behold the door
[33:46] was opened in heaven
[33:48] first voice which i heard was elijah was
[33:49] a trumpet talking with me says come up
[33:51] hither now we're going to see this in a
[33:52] minute
[33:54] and i will show these things which must
[33:55] be hereafter and immediately i was in
[33:57] the spirit and behold the throne was set
[33:59] in heaven
[34:00] and one sat on the throne now let's take
[34:02] to pull the chart back up just for a
[34:03] minute
[34:06] and we'll not get all this done tonight
[34:07] that's okay the ones you that keep this
[34:09] don't worry there's a bunch of pages but
[34:10] some of that will be for for sunday also
[34:13] so we got the church ages over with
[34:16] right
[34:17] the rapture is going to take place
[34:20] yep there you go church age is over with
[34:23] the revelation of the son of man has
[34:25] been made real to somebody
[34:28] it doesn't have to be but one person
[34:30] but somebody's got to be alive and call
[34:33] the dead saints from all these
[34:36] wow
[34:37] seven church ages
[34:39] call them all uh paul irenaeus martin
[34:41] all the different ones in the different
[34:42] church ages think about that you said
[34:45] it's impossible the bible says it's
[34:47] possible
[34:49] all things are possible to them that
[34:50] believe
[34:51] we've just got to start believing that
[34:53] you say well i'm just i just come in the
[34:55] message and i don't know nothing
[35:00] there's a lot of people been here not
[35:02] here but in the message 30 years and
[35:03] still don't know nothing
[35:06] i didn't say here i'm in the message and
[35:07] still don't know nothing
[35:09] you got to get born again look because
[35:11] look all born-again believers are going
[35:12] to go in the rapture
[35:14] no born again believer is going to get
[35:16] left here
[35:17] there's no left behind sorry world
[35:20] i like that song goodbye world
[35:24] right goodbye
[35:27] i stay not here i'm not going to stay
[35:28] here any longer
[35:30] so when we leave what's god going to do
[35:33] he's not he's got that comma
[35:35] he preached the acceptable year of the
[35:37] lord comma and then the day of vengeance
[35:39] it's going to start as soon as we leave
[35:42] there will be tribulation
[35:45] beginning
[35:46] on the earth is everybody all right with
[35:48] that
[35:49] so let's read now
[35:50] we're going to talk matthew now look
[35:52] this is a no go back again one more time
[35:54] sorry
[35:57] rapture we just revelations 4 1 we were
[36:00] caught up
[36:01] all right
[36:02] caught up in a rapture then the two
[36:04] prophets are going to come
[36:06] and preach
[36:07] three and a half years or 1260 days
[36:10] at 30 days to a month everybody got that
[36:13] three and a half years or 42 months
[36:15] you're going to see that word in just a
[36:16] few minutes now the millennium's not yet
[36:19] we're still in time
[36:22] time doesn't end
[36:23] time end for you when you got born again
[36:25] right that's right
[36:27] time shall be no longer
[36:29] but now remember we'll read in daniel
[36:31] where though they that they're given a
[36:32] time times and a dividing of times
[36:35] because the jewish the jewish age listen
[36:39] the gentile age as many tongues many
[36:41] nations get born again it's an
[36:43] individual affair with god but israel
[36:45] god has always dealt with israel as what
[36:48] a nation
[36:50] so he's going to deal with them in 12
[36:52] tribes
[36:53] twelve thousand to a tribe
[36:55] and give them three and a half years to
[36:57] get saved
[36:58] because what did brother brahma always
[37:00] tell us the jews were god's timepiece
[37:05] okay watch the jews watch the timing of
[37:07] the jews watch their timepiece because
[37:11] these two prophets once 1260 days is
[37:14] over
[37:15] they know they're going to die
[37:17] because the bible says they're going to
[37:19] die
[37:20] all
[37:20] right look
[37:25] they don't get a promise of alive and
[37:26] remain
[37:30] because they turned god down
[37:33] as a nation long time ago but god's not
[37:36] going to forget the remnant that he's
[37:37] going to take out of that
[37:40] and we were talking uh last week
[37:43] being brother donnie i believe it was
[37:44] it's those orthodox jews
[37:47] there's jews in this world that do not
[37:49] care a thing about god never have and
[37:51] never will
[37:52] carry anything about god
[37:53] it's just that orthodox jew that sits
[37:55] there every day at the wailing wall and
[37:57] he tries his best to get the messiah on
[38:00] the earth
[38:02] but they're blinded and then when it's
[38:04] going to be lifted off there's only
[38:06] going to be
[38:07] 144 000 it's going to listen to those
[38:10] two witnesses
[38:11] and everybody else is going to do just
[38:13] like me and you get persecuted from
[38:15] within
[38:26] where does persecution come from
[38:28] your family
[38:31] usually it comes from your family amen
[38:35] what are you talking about boys
[38:37] i mean you just talked about that didn't
[38:38] we
[38:39] but really it is so what's going on
[38:40] because it's common
[38:43] it's common
[38:44] for us to be
[38:46] message believers
[38:49] but if brother donny
[38:53] gets the anointing
[38:57] of adoption
[38:59] he needs a gallon of gas in his car when
[39:01] it's wearing the persecution
[39:03] and he says lord i need a gallon of gas
[39:06] and a gallon of gas appears in his car
[39:08] or he said lord i'm hungry
[39:12] and a good old pork chop falls in his
[39:13] lap you think that's that's not strange
[39:16] that will happen
[39:18] but see you got me that's dilly-dallied
[39:19] around and comes to church half the time
[39:21] and does whatever we want to do in the
[39:22] world and then i think i'm bride and i'm
[39:24] gonna go lord why are you not
[39:26] he's gonna say what
[39:29] depart from me i never knew you
[39:32] i'm not gonna get the pork chop because
[39:34] i didn't come to the place
[39:35] that brother donny did
[39:38] so who's gonna be the maddest the
[39:39] neighbor out here
[39:41] or this guy that's standing right here
[39:43] right who's going to be the worst mad
[39:45] i'm in the message god
[39:49] why can't i get the same thing he gets
[39:52] then he's going to turn his persecution
[39:53] on you
[39:55] so you see what i mean i'm not saying
[39:56] that toward family i'm in the church
[39:58] family
[40:00] and i'm not saying y'all i'm just saying
[40:01] where does our biggest persecution come
[40:03] from though
[40:04] your neighbor don't care if you're a
[40:06] manifested son of god
[40:08] right he might at one time
[40:10] but he really don't care because he
[40:12] don't even know what a manifested son of
[40:14] god is
[40:15] if he's not a believer
[40:17] but when you've got a made believer
[40:19] and an unbeliever that thinks they're
[40:21] believers
[40:23] this is not my sermon
[40:26] but if you've got made believers and
[40:27] unbelievers and true believers who's
[40:30] going to persecute not the neighbor
[40:32] the mate believers and unbelievers
[40:34] they're going to persecute the true
[40:36] believers same thing with these two
[40:37] prophets they're not going to be killed
[40:40] by the jew that owns the
[40:43] diamond shop on the corner in jerusalem
[40:48] no they're going to be killed by the
[40:49] orthodox jew that has spent his life
[40:52] putting that temple back together
[40:54] and when those two witnesses stand in
[40:56] front of that temple and say
[40:57] god is not in that temple
[41:00] hadn't been in there for 2 000 years
[41:03] and will not be in that temple
[41:06] what are they going to do they're going
[41:07] to try to kill them two prophets
[41:09] they're going to try to kill the people
[41:10] that follow those two prophets
[41:14] so talk about tribulation yes it's going
[41:16] to be a tribulation for the whole world
[41:18] but then it's going to begin
[41:20] in the jewish community because i'll
[41:21] read it to you in a few minutes
[41:23] everybody all right say amen
[41:26] all right
[41:27] so matthew 24
[41:29] 21 for then shall be great tribulation
[41:33] such as was not since the beginning of
[41:35] the world
[41:36] to this time
[41:38] nor ever shall be
[41:41] it's the wrath of god
[41:44] and except those days should be
[41:45] shortened
[41:46] thank god
[41:48] there should no flesh be saved flesh
[41:52] be saved
[41:54] but for the elect sake
[41:56] those days
[41:58] shall be shortened what month are we in
[42:00] august wasn't in january just a couple
[42:02] weeks ago
[42:05] we're just getting over christmas
[42:07] christmas will be back here in just a
[42:08] few months
[42:10] how many of us have said
[42:12] time's fine
[42:14] well that's why god is allowing that for
[42:16] it to fly why would we be why would be
[42:18] here we go
[42:19] man it seems like this year's three or
[42:21] four years no it's we've never done that
[42:23] except when you were a kid
[42:25] right when you were a kid christmas came
[42:26] over three years if that felt like now
[42:29] it comes every three months to an adult
[42:31] right
[42:33] amen
[42:36] that's god god's providence
[42:40] giving us time
[42:42] and it seems short
[42:44] all right now let's go to the next one
[42:47] revelations 2 20-22
[42:51] notwithstanding i have a few things
[42:53] against thee because thou suffers that
[42:54] woman jezebel a woman which calls
[42:57] herself a prophetess to teach
[43:00] and seduce my servants to commit
[43:02] fornication now that's not literal
[43:05] that's spiritual
[43:06] all right and to eat things sacrificed
[43:09] unto idols now he's talking about the
[43:10] church age and i give her space to
[43:13] repent
[43:15] he gave her 2
[43:17] 000 years
[43:19] to repent
[43:20] 2 000 years
[43:22] i gave her space to repent of her
[43:24] fornication
[43:25] and she repented not
[43:29] behold i will cast her into a bed and
[43:31] then that commit adultery with her into
[43:34] great tribulation except they repent
[43:38] of their deeds
[43:40] revelations 13 4
[43:43] and they worshipped the dragon which
[43:45] gave power and to the beast and they
[43:46] worshiped the beast saying who is
[43:48] likened to the beast see this guy's
[43:50] going to raise up on the scene when we
[43:51] leave and he's going to be like god he's
[43:54] going to be the prophet they needed
[43:56] he's going to be the
[43:57] president that they needed or the head
[44:00] of the government that they needed or
[44:01] the head of the u.n that they needed
[44:03] because he's going to be able to do
[44:04] miracles
[44:07] and that's what people are looking for
[44:08] folks people are looking for miracles
[44:11] they don't want to see it in you
[44:13] right
[44:14] they want to see it in some government
[44:16] head
[44:17] so that everybody can benefit from it
[44:20] all right so who is likened to the beast
[44:22] and who is able to make war with him in
[44:23] other words
[44:25] the nations are powerless
[44:29] and there was given unto him a mouth
[44:30] speaking great things and blasphemies
[44:33] and power was given unto him to continue
[44:36] 42 months what is 42 months
[44:42] three and a half years
[44:44] 42 months 12 312 is 36 right
[44:48] and then half of that would be
[44:50] 42.
[44:52] and he opened his mouth and blasphemed
[44:53] me against god into blasphemous name and
[44:55] his tabernacle and them that dwell in
[44:57] heaven
[44:59] and it was given unto him to make war
[45:00] with the saints and overcome them and
[45:01] power was given unto them all kindred
[45:04] tongues and nations
[45:05] now this is
[45:07] revelations
[45:08] 13
[45:10] 8.
[45:12] everybody got that
[45:14] revelations 13 8
[45:17] and all that dwell upon the earth all
[45:21] will worship him
[45:24] whose names are not written in the book
[45:26] of the life of the lamb slain from the
[45:28] foundation of the world
[45:32] is hebrews 13 8
[45:35] jesus christ
[45:36] the same yesterday
[45:38] today
[45:40] and forever that's what they turned down
[45:42] then brother brown saying say eve
[45:45] eve lost it on hebrews 13 8.
[45:50] and all that dwell on the earth shall
[45:52] worship him whose names are not written
[45:53] in the book yeah they love the jesus of
[45:54] the past
[45:56] but he's like a second person
[45:59] and the holy ghost is the third person
[46:01] they really don't know where the
[46:02] father's at
[46:03] see how messed up it is
[46:05] but whose names are not written in the
[46:07] book of the life of the lamb's claim
[46:08] from foundation the world they all are
[46:10] going to fall under his rule
[46:12] you're not going to be able to help it
[46:14] unless you are
[46:15] a foolish virgin who has just a little
[46:17] bit of knowledge not to do exactly what
[46:20] he says but you know what's going to
[46:21] happen to them they're going to get
[46:23] killed
[46:24] amen is that right
[46:26] now look
[46:28] revelations 11 3
[46:30] and i will give power unto my two
[46:32] witnesses
[46:33] and they shall prophesy a thousand two
[46:35] hundred and three score days there's
[46:36] your twelve hundred and sixty days
[46:39] clothed in sackcloth now these are what
[46:41] the two olive trees and the two
[46:42] candlesticks standing before the god of
[46:44] the earth that would be the spirit of
[46:46] what moses and the spirit of elijah we
[46:48] know that right
[46:49] and if any man will hurt them fire not
[46:51] literal fire they look like a
[46:53] flamethrower
[46:56] what their words are powerful they will
[46:59] mean something listen you and i are
[47:01] going to have that same fire before we
[47:04] leave this earth
[47:06] you and i brother brown said for just a
[47:08] moment
[47:09] god's going to come on the scene to us
[47:11] and we're going to be able because some
[47:13] whoever's going to be alive and remain
[47:14] is going to have to shun death away from
[47:17] him it doesn't matter if they've trained
[47:18] a 50 caliber machine gun on you
[47:27] if any man will hurt them fire proceed
[47:28] out of their mouth and devour because
[47:30] remember like i said before they're
[47:32] going to make the whole world mad not
[47:34] just a few people
[47:35] they're really going to make the whole
[47:36] world mad and the whole world's going to
[47:39] want to kill them the mossad the c.i.a
[47:41] the fbi the kgb they're all going to
[47:44] want to kill these two people but
[47:45] they're going to have an anointing on
[47:47] them where they do not die because god
[47:49] said they're going to live 1200 1260
[47:52] days
[47:53] now see if we can get that anointing on
[47:55] us
[47:56] with our listen with our anointing that
[47:59] says we which are alive and remain we
[48:01] won't die
[48:04] we're looking for that
[48:06] we're searching
[48:08] listen folks that's what i come to
[48:09] church for
[48:11] i come to church
[48:13] so that you'll get something that'll
[48:14] help you be that alive and remain
[48:17] every service not just to be a good
[48:19] christian or be a good this or be a good
[48:20] dad or be a good person out in the world
[48:22] i want somebody to be that alive and
[48:25] remain
[48:28] you
[48:29] i want somebody here
[48:31] i'm not preaching to the world i'm not
[48:33] preaching to the other place
[48:34] right here
[48:35] [Applause]
[48:37] i want somebody to enjoy
[48:41] enjoy looking at death and going
[48:46] nobody's ever done that
[48:48] oh death where'd you stand graves were
[48:49] your victory paul died
[48:52] sure we know he got the victory but he
[48:54] had to die
[48:55] i'm talking about somebody standing
[48:57] brother john and saying death
[48:59] you have no part with me listen we are
[49:03] we have been trained all of our life
[49:05] that we're going to die
[49:09] when i die hallelujah by my i'll fly
[49:12] away that was a that was a that's okay
[49:15] that was a revelation back then
[49:17] that was a revelation under the son of
[49:18] god message
[49:20] but not under the son of man message
[49:22] you can't kill the son of man he's done
[49:24] died for you so you don't have to
[49:28] and if any man will hurt them fire
[49:29] proceeds out of their mouth
[49:31] and devour their enemies and if any man
[49:33] will hurt them he must in this manner be
[49:36] killed what about you see somebody
[49:39] a covert
[49:41] guy you know that looks kind of like
[49:43] zach black
[49:46] a little middle eastern leaf looking
[49:48] no
[49:49] somebody walk up to you and he's got
[49:51] this poison dart and he says hey how you
[49:53] doing two witnesses you know and he's
[49:54] sitting there filling them full of
[49:56] poison and they're going
[50:00] remember what paul did one time
[50:03] paul was picking up sticks
[50:06] picking up sticks and one like a black
[50:08] mamba
[50:10] come out of the thing and beat him on
[50:11] the arm and they all was watching him
[50:14] see how long he'd take him to die isn't
[50:16] what the world doing to us they're doing
[50:17] the same thing they're looking for us to
[50:19] mess up and they look and say well they
[50:21] really don't have what they say they
[50:23] have no we have got what the bible says
[50:25] we have
[50:26] and man that's what i'm looking for i'm
[50:28] not looking for all this other stuff i'm
[50:30] not looking for all this frailty that we
[50:31] have in the body i'm looking at a
[50:33] promise
[50:34] that god give us already not one coming
[50:37] one now
[50:39] so that so what's gonna happen
[50:42] if they sit there with that dart and
[50:43] they're going hey man how you doing they
[50:45] got that ring you know it's got that
[50:46] little sticker in it you know it's just
[50:48] they have those you know
[50:50] did you feel that okay
[50:52] you'll be gone in a minute
[50:53] okay pray for you
[50:55] but in that manner they got to be killed
[50:57] so somehow that turns around on them and
[50:59] they die
[51:00] boy what a god
[51:03] i'm just reading scripture
[51:04] but there's a reality to this sometimes
[51:06] we think well this is scripture and it's
[51:07] going to happen and sure it's going to
[51:08] happen when we're out of here but it's
[51:10] going to be god that's going to be
[51:12] leading these two prophets and they
[51:14] can't be killed
[51:15] i don't care what they do to them they
[51:17] can feed them poison for 20 days in a
[51:19] row
[51:20] actually they can feed them poison for
[51:22] three and a half years
[51:23] and they're not gonna die
[51:28] these have power to shut heaven and it
[51:29] rain not in the days of their prophecy
[51:31] and have power over waters to turn into
[51:32] blood to smite the earth with all
[51:34] plagues as often as they will
[51:41] keep going please
[51:42] and when they shall have finished their
[51:44] testimony
[51:46] the beast that ascended out of the
[51:47] bottomless pit shall make war against
[51:49] them and shall overcome them
[51:52] and kill them look when they have
[51:53] finished their testimony
[51:56] the beast will kill them
[51:58] and they'll lay in the streets we know
[52:00] that for three and a half days and they
[52:02] hate these two people
[52:04] these two people have absolutely turned
[52:06] the world upside down and they can't do
[52:08] anything to them until now i got you
[52:11] but guess what's going to happen
[52:14] they're going to rise after three and a
[52:15] half days
[52:17] and 144 000 too and they're going to
[52:19] disappear
[52:20] they're going to be caught up just like
[52:22] we were called up
[52:24] all right so let's read daniel 12 7
[52:27] and i heard the man clothed in linen
[52:29] which was upon the water of the river
[52:31] when he held up his right hand and his
[52:32] left hand into heaven and swear by him
[52:34] that liveth forever that had a beast for
[52:36] a time times and a half that's one two
[52:39] that would be one plus two plus a half
[52:42] that's three and a half years when he
[52:43] shall have accomplished look to scatter
[52:45] the power of the holy people
[52:47] all these things
[52:49] shall be finished and i heard but i
[52:50] understood not then i said oh my lord
[52:52] what shall the end of these things
[52:54] listen it wasn't as great a prophet as
[52:57] daniel was this wasn't meant for him to
[52:59] understand
[53:02] but it was for me and you
[53:05] we had a prophet coming in time to tell
[53:07] us exactly what that meant
[53:11] and he said go thy way daniel
[53:13] for the words are closed up and sealed
[53:17] didn't brother ram stand up on the
[53:19] questions and answers of the seals and
[53:20] he said it's not for you
[53:22] it's gone from you you're not even
[53:24] supposed to get it
[53:27] same thing
[53:29] it was closed up to those people
[53:31] because they were they were living under
[53:33] the son of god message and that's where
[53:36] they were going to die and go by the
[53:37] grave which is listen no problem with
[53:40] that
[53:41] they're born again just as born again as
[53:43] you are
[53:44] okay for the words are closed up and
[53:46] sealed till the time of the end many
[53:48] shall be purified
[53:49] what from daniel's time
[53:52] that's about 4 000 years from when
[53:53] daniel prophesied this till the end of
[53:55] this age
[53:57] so many shall be purified made white and
[54:00] tried but the wicked shall do wickedly
[54:02] and none of the wicked shall understand
[54:04] but the bride
[54:07] but the bride shall understand
[54:11] the wise
[54:12] shall understand
[54:14] daniel 9 24 70 weeks
[54:20] god
[54:23] never
[54:24] ever will forget those jews
[54:27] as bad as they did think of the things
[54:29] that they did to him being idolaters and
[54:32] all the doing exactly what he told them
[54:33] not to do
[54:34] yet he still loved them and he said i'm
[54:36] gonna take a group i'm going to redeem a
[54:39] group of people
[54:41] and they're going to live a millennium
[54:43] and i'm going to have a promise son of
[54:45] david i'll read it in just a minute
[54:47] there's a promise
[54:49] a promise to david a natural man that
[54:51] was a murderer and a an
[54:54] adulterer
[54:56] he promised
[54:58] i'll have a seat that you'll sit on in
[55:00] the millennium and you'll you'll not
[55:02] david himself but the son of david all
[55:05] right we'll rule the 12 tribes of israel
[55:07] that's a promise
[55:09] just like the promise is what
[55:12] you'll be there with your offspring
[55:14] see that's part of the millennium
[55:17] but it's also part of the future home
[55:19] all right so what's going to do 70 weeks
[55:21] are determined
[55:22] now just been reading going back i've
[55:24] been reading in jeremiah
[55:26] how jeremiah was in captivity
[55:29] and then remember daniel
[55:31] is going
[55:32] over jeremiah's book
[55:35] he's reading jeremiah just like we're
[55:36] reading jeremiah he's reading jeremiah
[55:38] he's seeing that 70 weeks
[55:40] are determined or 70 years at that time
[55:42] there were 70 years in captivity
[55:45] 68 years daniel said two more years lord
[55:48] what's going to happen the prophet of
[55:49] god said
[55:50] he didn't just only show daniel what was
[55:52] going to happen when they got out he
[55:53] showed him all the way to the
[55:55] consummation which would be
[55:57] battle of armageddon
[55:59] all right
[56:00] or coming into the millennium does
[56:02] everybody got that
[56:05] 70 weeks are determined upon thy people
[56:07] who jews and upon thy holy city so
[56:10] remember it's to the jews
[56:12] and the city
[56:13] everybody got that we've been over this
[56:15] time and time again
[56:16] but remember there's got to be a
[56:17] connection to the people and the city
[56:21] you and i don't have a continuing city
[56:23] abraham
[56:24] we're looking for a city whose building
[56:26] maker is god we know it's the future
[56:28] home we're not going to get there for
[56:30] another thousand in whatever years we've
[56:32] got left here
[56:35] but they're going to get a millennial
[56:37] temple
[56:38] because god promised it
[56:40] so 70 weeks are determined upon by
[56:42] people and upon thy holy city to do six
[56:44] things
[56:45] to finish the transgression of israel
[56:48] to make an end of israel's sin
[56:52] how is that that's through a message
[56:54] they've turned everybody else down
[56:56] the two prophets they're going to preach
[56:59] justification
[57:01] sanctification
[57:03] and to make reconciliation
[57:05] for their iniquity
[57:09] then it's going to stop for the people
[57:11] and then you got to bring in everlasting
[57:12] righteousness
[57:14] seal up the vision in prophecy
[57:17] and anoint the most
[57:18] holy everybody got that
[57:21] you've been through this before but
[57:22] there's some new ones here and they they
[57:23] need to get
[57:24] it so what's two prophets gonna do the
[57:27] two prophets they're they're not
[57:29] commissioned to build a millennial
[57:31] temple
[57:32] they're commissioned to get
[57:34] 1260 days of preaching and call 12 000
[57:38] of each tribe 12 times 12 is 144 000.
[57:41] that's their job
[57:44] but i believe in calling those 144 000
[57:47] out
[57:48] them going up in a rapture then
[57:51] armageddon happens that that 144 000 is
[57:53] going to come back here and build that
[57:55] temple because you and i don't have a
[57:56] temple we don't know how to build
[57:58] temples
[57:59] amen we are the temple of god
[58:02] all right so let's go now
[58:04] to zechariah 12 and i will pour upon the
[58:07] house of david see look
[58:09] house of david jew
[58:12] and upon the inhabitants of jerusalem
[58:16] people and city
[58:18] the spirit of grace and of supplications
[58:22] you know what we just said
[58:26] and they shall look upon me whom they
[58:27] have pierced and they shall mourn for
[58:28] him as one morning for his only son and
[58:30] shall be in bitterness for him as one
[58:32] that is in bitterness for his firstborn
[58:34] we know that's what it is
[58:35] that's when
[58:37] jesus christ is revealed to the 144
[58:40] thousand that they killed him 2000 years
[58:43] ago
[58:44] all right
[58:45] and that day shall be a great morning in
[58:47] jerusalem as the morning of hadrimandan
[58:49] in the valley
[58:51] of where
[58:53] armageddon
[58:54] all right let's go to jeremiah 30 verse
[58:56] 7. i picked these up
[58:58] in reading in jeremiah so i included
[59:00] them in because i didn't bring this out
[59:02] the other day i want to bring it out now
[59:05] because it's called jacob's trouble
[59:10] everybody got that
[59:11] watch alas for that day is great so that
[59:14] none is like it it is even the time of
[59:17] jacob's trouble
[59:21] but
[59:23] he shall be saved out of it
[59:25] there's 144 000 going to be saved out of
[59:28] that
[59:30] look for it shall come to pass in that
[59:32] day
[59:32] saith the lord of hosts that i will
[59:34] break his yoke from off thy neck and
[59:36] that will burst our bones sounds like
[59:38] somebody's getting free from something
[59:40] a man gets free from bondage
[59:43] and strangers shall no more serve
[59:45] themself of him lot watch this
[59:48] but they shall serve the lord their god
[59:51] and david their king
[59:54] that's not to us folks
[59:56] that's the son of david not literal
[59:58] david it's the son of david whom i will
[1:00:01] raise up unto them therefore fear they
[1:00:04] are not o my servant jacob
[1:00:07] saith the lord neither be dismayed o
[1:00:09] israel
[1:00:10] for lo i will save thee look from afar
[1:00:16] now listen
[1:00:18] i was reading a commentary from scofield
[1:00:21] and he made a real good statement i want
[1:00:23] to read this
[1:00:25] everywhere the jews have been dispersed
[1:00:27] in the world now this is schofield in in
[1:00:29] the early 1900s not even they haven't
[1:00:32] come back in 1946 because he spoke this
[1:00:34] in like the 20s
[1:00:36] he said they have been dispersed all
[1:00:37] over the world everywhere a jew goes
[1:00:41] there's prosperity
[1:00:44] think about it
[1:00:46] but everywhere a jew goes there's
[1:00:47] persecution
[1:00:50] they went to russia two and a half
[1:00:51] million of them went to russia early in
[1:00:53] the in the early 1900s and they got
[1:00:56] persecuted completely out but what were
[1:00:58] they jewelers
[1:01:00] they were business owners
[1:01:02] they had the money they owned the banks
[1:01:04] now look in america when they got
[1:01:06] dispersed where'd they go some of them
[1:01:08] come to america
[1:01:09] that's why hitler hated him he didn't
[1:01:10] hate him because they were jews folks i
[1:01:12] really don't think that he hated them
[1:01:14] because they had all the money
[1:01:16] and remember what they would do they
[1:01:17] would take their suitcase jew's not
[1:01:18] going to be far from his money he'd take
[1:01:20] their suit he wasn't going to put the
[1:01:22] suitcase in there to get burnt up
[1:01:25] get leave your suitcase right here
[1:01:27] because he knew there was probably
[1:01:28] thousands of dollars in that suitcase
[1:01:30] take all your clothes off
[1:01:33] and get into here we're going to give
[1:01:34] you a shower
[1:01:36] that's what he said
[1:01:38] and they put them in a gas chamber and
[1:01:40] killed them by the millions
[1:01:42] but they took even it was told that they
[1:01:44] took the gold out of their teeth
[1:01:46] after they died
[1:01:48] that's how bad hitler hated them but see
[1:01:49] they got dispersed and they got well
[1:01:52] look who owns wall street
[1:01:55] they're jews
[1:01:57] they're not americans sure they're
[1:01:58] american jews but they're jewish people
[1:02:00] so everywhere the jews go are dispersed
[1:02:02] because look watch this
[1:02:05] neither be the tomato israel for low i
[1:02:07] will save thee from afar
[1:02:09] and thy seed from the land of their what
[1:02:11] captivity
[1:02:13] god knows he told them you're going to
[1:02:16] be dispersed into every country in the
[1:02:18] world
[1:02:19] you're going to be driven out of
[1:02:20] jerusalem because see i can only deal
[1:02:22] with you when you're here
[1:02:24] and i'm not ready to deal with you
[1:02:26] because i got what
[1:02:27] 2 thousand years of gentile rule
[1:02:31] that i've got to bring a bride out of
[1:02:32] that 2000 years and i don't want you
[1:02:34] back in your homeland
[1:02:37] but now when they leave
[1:02:39] i'm going to bring you back and jacob
[1:02:42] shall return and shall be in rest now
[1:02:45] are they unrest over there now
[1:02:48] no
[1:02:49] they sleep with one eye open and one eye
[1:02:50] closed
[1:02:52] thinking the palestinians or anybody
[1:02:53] else is going to drop a bomb on them
[1:02:55] shall be in rest and be quiet
[1:02:58] and none shall make him afraid
[1:03:01] for i am with thee saith the lord to
[1:03:02] save thee though i make a full end look
[1:03:05] now what's he promising
[1:03:08] he says i scattered them
[1:03:10] but i will destroy every nation remember
[1:03:13] the ten kingdoms won't won't be a jewish
[1:03:16] kingdom folks those ten toes
[1:03:18] that's all gentile
[1:03:19] right
[1:03:22] for i am with thee saith the lord to
[1:03:24] save thee though i make a full end of
[1:03:26] all nations whether i have scattered
[1:03:29] these so in other words he scattered
[1:03:31] them into the nations made those nations
[1:03:33] prosperous
[1:03:35] but what did those nations do
[1:03:37] listen in russia read your history in
[1:03:39] russia they put them that's where the
[1:03:40] first word ghetto came
[1:03:42] from they herded them into ghettos
[1:03:47] no bathroom
[1:03:50] horrible living conditions
[1:03:52] just because they were jews now we know
[1:03:54] hitler persecuted them worse than that
[1:03:55] because he killed them but they've been
[1:03:56] persecuted everywhere they go
[1:03:58] why
[1:03:59] people hate them
[1:04:01] don't they hate them now
[1:04:03] people hate jews why they hate jews
[1:04:05] because they're jews
[1:04:06] you know why because right down inside
[1:04:08] people know they're god's
[1:04:10] people and god's given so many promises
[1:04:13] in the old testament that he's going to
[1:04:15] one day return back
[1:04:19] but he said i will make a full end of
[1:04:21] all nations
[1:04:23] whether i have scattered thee
[1:04:25] yet will i not make a full end of you
[1:04:29] he's going to save a remnant
[1:04:32] but i will correct thee and measure and
[1:04:33] will not leave thee all together
[1:04:36] unpunished we know why they're going to
[1:04:37] be persecuted they're going to be killed
[1:04:39] six and a half million of them during
[1:04:40] the holocaust
[1:04:42] which by the way
[1:04:43] was real
[1:04:46] some of you might want to look on the
[1:04:48] internet and see where they say it's not
[1:04:50] it was real
[1:04:51] all right now look
[1:04:54] he's going to destroy those ten toes
[1:04:56] remember what happened to the ten toes
[1:04:58] the ten toes was the last ten gentile
[1:05:01] nations
[1:05:02] after we're gone
[1:05:05] who destroys them
[1:05:07] the stone that comes down out of the
[1:05:09] mountain not made by hands christ
[1:05:12] comes and destroys those ten nations the
[1:05:15] battle of armageddon
[1:05:16] but see the hundred forty four thousand
[1:05:18] is going to be gone
[1:05:19] the ones that he dispersed and the ones
[1:05:21] that he brought back the ones that he
[1:05:22] said would be in jacob's trouble
[1:05:24] they're going to be
[1:05:27] sent up in a rapture
[1:05:29] revelation 6 verse 12.
[1:05:32] and that'll be held when he had opened
[1:05:33] the sixth seal a low there was a great
[1:05:34] earthquake and the sun became black as
[1:05:36] sack cloths of hair and the moon became
[1:05:37] his blood
[1:05:38] stars of heaven fell into the earth
[1:05:41] even as a fig casters her untimely figs
[1:05:42] when she is shaking of a mighty wind now
[1:05:44] this is the sixth seal brother brown
[1:05:45] said who opens that sixth sail
[1:05:48] two prophets all right and then the
[1:05:51] heaven departed as a scroll when it was
[1:05:52] rolled together like i said a nuclear
[1:05:54] expo explosion and every mountain and
[1:05:56] island were moved out of their places
[1:05:57] and all the kings of the earth oh
[1:05:59] there's those kings
[1:06:00] and the great men
[1:06:03] and the rich men
[1:06:04] and the chief captains and the mighty
[1:06:06] men and every bondman and every freeman
[1:06:07] hid themselves in the dens and the rocks
[1:06:09] of the mountains instead of the
[1:06:10] mountains and rocks fall on us
[1:06:12] and hide us from the face of him that
[1:06:14] sitteth on the throne and from the wrath
[1:06:15] of the lamb for the great day of his
[1:06:17] wrath has come and who shall be able
[1:06:21] to stand
[1:06:22] prophet god said those two witnesses
[1:06:25] interrupt nature
[1:06:27] they call all these things down on the
[1:06:29] world
[1:06:30] for a tribulation a time of tribulation
[1:06:33] while they're going through jacob's
[1:06:34] trouble and then what's going to happen
[1:06:36] we're going to have a battle of
[1:06:37] armageddon but let's read revelation 7
[1:06:39] verse 1.
[1:06:42] i like the way how we stay in scripture
[1:06:44] everybody like we're staying in
[1:06:45] scripture i want you to understand not
[1:06:48] just what brother brown said
[1:06:49] this is bible
[1:06:51] this is what the bible says about it now
[1:06:53] it took a profit to put these pieces
[1:06:54] together don't get me wrong
[1:06:56] but now that he put the pieces together
[1:06:58] like i said many times before if we get
[1:07:00] the essence of the message when we
[1:07:02] read the bible
[1:07:04] when we read the bible
[1:07:07] we hear the prophet of god in the
[1:07:09] background telling us
[1:07:11] what that is
[1:07:12] amen don't you and that's the way it is
[1:07:14] to you you don't have to go but i don't
[1:07:15] know if that's what it is let me go see
[1:07:17] if i can find a quote you shouldn't have
[1:07:18] to do that
[1:07:20] you should look at it and go that ain't
[1:07:22] nothing but the truth
[1:07:25] and after these things i saw four angels
[1:07:27] standing on the four corners of the
[1:07:29] earth
[1:07:30] holding the four winds now water winds
[1:07:32] wars
[1:07:33] that the wind should not blow on the
[1:07:35] earth nor the sea and on any tree that's
[1:07:37] brother claude was preaching the other
[1:07:38] day you know you got your woes well
[1:07:40] there's four angels
[1:07:45] and what are the winds
[1:07:47] wars
[1:07:48] right
[1:07:49] that the war
[1:07:51] remember he stopped world war one or the
[1:07:53] prophet of god said man would have
[1:07:55] destroyed the whole world but he stopped
[1:07:57] world war one nobody knows
[1:07:59] why do we have veterans today
[1:08:02] on november the 11th
[1:08:06] do you all not know what that is
[1:08:08] aaron
[1:08:09] do they not know what that is
[1:08:11] why do we have veterans day on november
[1:08:12] 11th 11 11
[1:08:15] because first world war ended on
[1:08:18] 11 11 on the 11th hour of the day the
[1:08:21] prophet says they don't know why it
[1:08:23] stopped it just stopped
[1:08:25] so they have veterans day on 11 11.
[1:08:28] just a little history lesson
[1:08:30] don't ever forget that
[1:08:32] okay
[1:08:35] now i saw another angel descending from
[1:08:37] the east having the seal of the living
[1:08:38] god and he cried with a loud voice of
[1:08:40] the four angels to whom it was given to
[1:08:42] hurt the earth and the sea saying hurt
[1:08:43] not the earth neither the sea nor the
[1:08:46] trees till we have sealed the servants
[1:08:49] not bride
[1:08:51] servants everybody got that say amen
[1:08:54] till we have sealed the servants of our
[1:08:56] god in their foreheads not a stamp
[1:09:00] oh lordy
[1:09:05] you know
[1:09:07] a preacher called me the other day and
[1:09:08] said you know what so there's a preacher
[1:09:10] in this message that's preaching the
[1:09:12] vaccine is the mark of the beef
[1:09:17] i'm going to sit down
[1:09:20] [Music]
[1:09:21] we have gone this long
[1:09:25] and even our kids right here in the
[1:09:27] front row don't believe that
[1:09:30] the vaccine is the mark of the beast
[1:09:35] a preacher in the message
[1:09:38] he needs the holy ghost
[1:09:40] i'm sorry
[1:09:42] we know
[1:09:43] what the mark of the beast is
[1:09:45] it's not a
[1:09:46] vaccine it's not a number stamped on
[1:09:49] your forehead
[1:09:50] it's not the barcode remember when the
[1:09:51] barcode came out everybody remembers
[1:09:53] when the barcode came out and everybody
[1:09:54] said
[1:09:55] that's the mark of the beast
[1:09:59] they're calling it everything but what
[1:10:01] it is
[1:10:02] because remember what i read you the
[1:10:04] whole world is going to be deceived
[1:10:07] by that beast
[1:10:09] and take that mark if you're not sealed
[1:10:12] by the holy ghost
[1:10:16] and it's not a vaccine
[1:10:22] and that's the truth somebody somebody
[1:10:24] called me said you believe what this
[1:10:25] brother's preaching and i said no i said
[1:10:27] tell me he said
[1:10:28] he's preaching at the mark of the beast
[1:10:29] is the vaccine so anyway
[1:10:32] well i have it so
[1:10:34] anyway so i heard the number of them
[1:10:36] which were sealed what is sealed by the
[1:10:39] holy ghost that was sealed how many
[1:10:43] forty-four thousand of all the tribes of
[1:10:45] the children of israel what's promised
[1:10:46] twelve thousand from each tribe twelve
[1:10:48] times twelve what
[1:10:53] 144 thousands she wins
[1:10:56] 144 thousand
[1:10:58] i knew left-handed people would know
[1:10:59] what was going on
[1:11:01] we have to stick together don't we
[1:11:02] sister
[1:11:04] somebody found her she's about to
[1:11:10] but that's all that's coming they called
[1:11:12] out 144 000. that's all
[1:11:15] okay
[1:11:16] now daniel 9 27.
[1:11:20] everybody all right we it's 9 28 24. and
[1:11:22] it's 9 24 it's 8 24. so we're good i
[1:11:26] feel good i feel a lot better than i did
[1:11:27] sunday that's for sure
[1:11:29] thank god
[1:11:30] and he shall confirm the covenant now
[1:11:32] who is that he that's that beast there's
[1:11:34] an antichrist that's that deceiver
[1:11:38] okay everybody got that we are not here
[1:11:41] when that covenant is signed so we know
[1:11:43] this is after the rapture of the church
[1:11:45] amen
[1:11:47] that he is not god because that he is
[1:11:49] fixing to break this covenant
[1:11:52] and god does not ever break a covenant
[1:11:54] who does
[1:11:56] man
[1:11:58] and he shall confirm the covenant with
[1:11:59] many for one week
[1:12:02] so
[1:12:02] how many years are left after the
[1:12:04] rapture seven years
[1:12:06] or one week okay
[1:12:08] and in the midst of the week
[1:12:10] what's the mist of seven
[1:12:12] three and a half plus three and a half
[1:12:14] is seven so that must be when the two
[1:12:16] prophets prophesy for three and a half
[1:12:18] years when they get finished prophesying
[1:12:21] he is going to break that covenant
[1:12:28] he shall cause the sacrifice and
[1:12:30] oblation to cease and for the
[1:12:32] overspreading of abominations he shall
[1:12:33] make it desolate even until the
[1:12:36] consummation
[1:12:37] and that determined shall be poured upon
[1:12:41] the desolate what is the consummation
[1:12:43] the consummation is the battle of
[1:12:44] armageddon the building of the temple
[1:12:46] and ushering in the millennium
[1:12:49] that's the end of the consummation
[1:12:50] everybody got that say amen
[1:12:52] all right
[1:12:54] now look revelations 11 7
[1:12:58] and when they the two witnesses shall
[1:13:00] have finished their testimony
[1:13:02] the beast that ascended this is where we
[1:13:03] were at a minute ago the beast that
[1:13:05] ascended out of the bottomless pit shall
[1:13:06] make war against them shall overcome
[1:13:09] them and kill them and their dead bodies
[1:13:11] shall lie in the streets of the great
[1:13:13] city which spiritually is called sodom
[1:13:14] which that would be jerusalem
[1:13:17] all right and egypt where also our lord
[1:13:19] was crucified so we know where he was
[1:13:21] crucified in jerusalem
[1:13:23] and of the people in kindred and tongue
[1:13:25] and nations shall see their dead bodies
[1:13:27] three days and a half i wonder why it's
[1:13:28] three and a half days
[1:13:31] coincide with three and a half years
[1:13:32] maybe
[1:13:33] and shall not suffer their dead bodies
[1:13:35] to be put in grace why people want to
[1:13:36] humiliate them
[1:13:38] and they that dwell upon the earth shall
[1:13:40] rejoice over them and make merry and
[1:13:42] shall send gifts one to another they're
[1:13:44] fixing to regret sending them gifts to
[1:13:47] each other
[1:13:48] because these two prophets tormented
[1:13:50] them that dwell on the earth and after
[1:13:52] three days and a half the spirit of life
[1:13:54] from god entered into them and they
[1:13:56] stood upon their feet
[1:13:57] cnn fox news abc cbs nbc
[1:14:02] reuters they're all there
[1:14:04] because they hate these two guys
[1:14:07] and they're going to see a miracle
[1:14:09] and they heard a great voice from heaven
[1:14:10] saying unto them come up hither
[1:14:13] isn't that what revelation 4 1 says
[1:14:15] come up hither let's take a rapture
[1:14:18] and they ascended up to heaven in a
[1:14:21] cloud
[1:14:22] and their enemies
[1:14:24] beheld them
[1:14:26] everybody okay
[1:14:29] so they're going to take a rapture just
[1:14:30] like we took a rapture
[1:14:31] they're going to be carried away now
[1:14:33] what's going to happen after they're
[1:14:34] carried away listen to this
[1:14:37] now let me stop right here just a minute
[1:14:39] that you might know beyond one shadow of
[1:14:40] a doubt
[1:14:42] i just wouldn't take that one place i
[1:14:44] can take it through the entire scripture
[1:14:45] and prove to you that seven days that
[1:14:47] seven one week is seven years we
[1:14:49] understood that from jacob right jacob
[1:14:52] marion
[1:14:53] working seven years for leah working
[1:14:55] seven years for rachel and the bible
[1:14:57] says he fulfilled their weak all right
[1:15:00] so brother brown is not just grabbing
[1:15:02] straws it was in the bible already all
[1:15:04] right i just did it over here in
[1:15:05] revelations chapter 11 chapter and third
[1:15:08] verse then prophets will prophesy one
[1:15:10] thousand two hundred three score days
[1:15:11] which is in the midst of the last week
[1:15:13] of the jews then they're cut off or
[1:15:15] killed and the armageddon
[1:15:18] sets in now what is armageddon that is
[1:15:21] man killing man that is atomic fire
[1:15:25] not god's fire
[1:15:27] everybody got that that is man hating
[1:15:30] man so bad
[1:15:32] until they want to destroy each other
[1:15:34] off the face of the earth
[1:15:36] all right let's go the first seal
[1:15:39] we've read this one we're going to read
[1:15:40] it again now when he gets the money all
[1:15:42] under control then he will break this
[1:15:44] covenant with the jews
[1:15:46] now listen he doesn't break it
[1:15:49] with 144 000.
[1:15:51] they're never part of that covenant
[1:15:54] just like me and you we're not part of
[1:15:55] this world
[1:15:56] when you get born again you're caught
[1:15:58] out you've caught up out of this world
[1:16:00] it's not the 144 thousand
[1:16:03] this is the whole of the nation of jews
[1:16:07] that he's going to break that covenant
[1:16:08] with as daniel here said he would do in
[1:16:10] the midst of the last half of the 70
[1:16:11] weeks of daniel and then brother what
[1:16:13] will he do he will have all the world
[1:16:14] trade and the commerce a pact with the
[1:16:17] world because he will hold the wealth of
[1:16:19] the world completely and during that
[1:16:21] time them two prophets will rise on the
[1:16:22] scene and call that 144 thousand then
[1:16:24] what will take place then the mark of
[1:16:26] the beast of revelation 13 will set him
[1:16:29] because he holds all the commerce
[1:16:30] trading everything in the world and what
[1:16:32] will take place then the mark of the
[1:16:33] beast will come in that no man can buy
[1:16:35] or sell except him that has the mark of
[1:16:37] the beast thank god the church will be
[1:16:39] enjoying a great three and a half years
[1:16:41] in glory don't have to go through that
[1:16:45] don't have to go through that now listen
[1:16:48] i wrote myself a note stop for a minute
[1:16:50] what is the mark of the beast i kind of
[1:16:52] got ahead of myself
[1:16:53] it's a doctrine
[1:16:55] it is not something on your forehead
[1:16:56] it's not something you eat it's not
[1:16:58] something they're going to shoot in your
[1:16:59] veins it's not something going gonna
[1:17:01] take you to the tattoo parlor
[1:17:03] it's it's in your forehead not own
[1:17:05] it's in
[1:17:06] in your intelligence
[1:17:08] he is going to deceive the whole world
[1:17:11] by his intelligence
[1:17:14] what satan took what
[1:17:16] the head
[1:17:17] god took the heart amen so he's going to
[1:17:20] go through this intelligence and he's
[1:17:23] going to deceive everybody
[1:17:26] at this time after the two witnesses
[1:17:28] leaving 144 000 he has deceived the
[1:17:31] whole complete world
[1:17:33] but somebody's going to get mad at him
[1:17:35] because he's holding everything
[1:17:37] and he's saying i'm god
[1:17:39] and you know what somebody's going to
[1:17:40] say prove
[1:17:42] it let's see if you let's see if you can
[1:17:45] make it through these three or four
[1:17:46] rounds of nuclear explosions
[1:17:49] right i mean that's the way man is going
[1:17:50] to be now look
[1:17:52] but revelations 19 6.
[1:17:55] and i heard it where's the voice of a
[1:17:56] great multitude it was the voice of many
[1:17:58] waters now look as the voice of mighty
[1:18:01] thundering saying hallelujah the lord
[1:18:02] god on omnipotent reigns now look that's
[1:18:05] not a set group of people
[1:18:07] that's not 144
[1:18:10] thousand it's voices great multitude
[1:18:15] bible says one time which no man can
[1:18:18] number
[1:18:20] right
[1:18:22] so it's got to be the bride
[1:18:25] as the voice of lightning saying
[1:18:26] alleluia the lord god i'm an impotent
[1:18:28] reigneth let us be glad and rejoice and
[1:18:30] give him honor for the marriage of the
[1:18:32] lamb has come and his wife has made
[1:18:34] herself ready that's what we're doing
[1:18:35] now
[1:18:36] but it's showing that we are going into
[1:18:39] a
[1:18:39] married supper and to her was granted
[1:18:42] that she should be arrayed in fine linen
[1:18:44] clean and white for the fine linen is
[1:18:47] the righteousness of
[1:18:48] saints
[1:18:49] and he said unto me right blessed are
[1:18:51] they which are called unto the marriage
[1:18:54] supper of the lamb and he said unto me
[1:18:55] these are the true
[1:18:57] sayings
[1:18:58] of god
[1:19:00] so while we're gone
[1:19:02] god's going to come down to the jews and
[1:19:04] reveal himself just like joseph
[1:19:06] took his
[1:19:07] gentile wife into the palace
[1:19:10] he comes back down and he reveals
[1:19:13] himself to his brethren
[1:19:14] the 144 thousand right
[1:19:17] the type of joseph all right he's going
[1:19:19] to come back down here he's going to
[1:19:20] reveal himself through two prophets
[1:19:23] but we're going to be enjoying the
[1:19:24] marriage supper
[1:19:25] and like i said before there is nowhere
[1:19:27] in the bible that it says it's for
[1:19:29] exactly three and a half years brother
[1:19:31] branham is putting together that while
[1:19:33] they're getting the three and a half
[1:19:34] year ministry down here on the earth
[1:19:36] we're enjoying three and a half years of
[1:19:38] a marriage supper somewhere in another
[1:19:40] dimension is everybody got that right
[1:19:42] and man because a lot of people have a
[1:19:43] contention about well it's only going to
[1:19:45] be three and a half years well the bible
[1:19:47] doesn't say that brother branham is just
[1:19:49] putting it together to overlap the three
[1:19:51] and a half years of of ministry down
[1:19:53] here that we're going to be gone
[1:19:55] somewhere
[1:19:56] because we're going to be glorified
[1:19:58] it's not going to matter what we're
[1:19:59] going to eat
[1:20:01] it's not going to matter where we're
[1:20:02] going to stay
[1:20:04] does it
[1:20:06] we could go sit on mars
[1:20:08] and be there just like that
[1:20:10] they want to go and it takes some months
[1:20:12] to get there we'll be going mars
[1:20:15] so it really doesn't matter so don't get
[1:20:16] caught up in that
[1:20:18] but we're not going to be here during
[1:20:20] that time of jacob's trouble and we're
[1:20:22] definitely not going to be here when the
[1:20:23] battle of armageddon starts
[1:20:26] we're coming back into the millennium
[1:20:29] after that
[1:20:30] we'll get to that in just a second then
[1:20:31] we'll quit and he said unto me right
[1:20:34] blessed are they which are called unto
[1:20:36] the marriage supper of the lamb and he
[1:20:37] said unto me these are the true
[1:20:39] sayings of god revelation 16 verse 13.
[1:20:42] amen all right
[1:20:44] and i saw three unclean spirits like
[1:20:46] frogs
[1:20:47] what was that
[1:20:49] there's your mark of the beast
[1:20:53] there's your trinitarian doctrine
[1:20:55] that has destroyed the bible
[1:21:01] sorry that's what the prophet said
[1:21:03] he said father son holy ghost baptism
[1:21:05] come from where
[1:21:06] the pits of hell i didn't say that he
[1:21:08] did because what it was cleaning three
[1:21:11] unclean spirits like frogs
[1:21:12] come out of the mouth of the dragon
[1:21:15] and out of the mouth of the beast and
[1:21:17] out of the mouth of the false prophet
[1:21:19] they all preach the same sermon
[1:21:23] 13 000 denominations pretty much believe
[1:21:25] the same thing
[1:21:28] thank god we're not part of that
[1:21:30] for they
[1:21:32] are the spirits
[1:21:33] of devils
[1:21:37] oh look working miracles
[1:21:39] yep
[1:21:41] which go forth unto the kings of the
[1:21:43] earth
[1:21:44] and the whole
[1:21:46] world
[1:21:48] to gather them together to the battle of
[1:21:50] that great day of god almighty
[1:21:53] behold i come as a thief blessed is he
[1:21:56] that watches and keepeth his garment
[1:21:57] unless he walked naked and they see his
[1:21:59] shame
[1:22:00] and he gathered them what the nations
[1:22:02] not these people the nations he
[1:22:04] interpolated he interjected that who's
[1:22:06] he coming as a thief and tonight for
[1:22:09] me and you
[1:22:11] all right
[1:22:12] because look keep your garments lest he
[1:22:15] walk naked and they see a shame and he
[1:22:17] gathered them together into a place
[1:22:18] called in the hebrew tongue armageddon
[1:22:21] and the seventh angel poured out his
[1:22:22] vial into the air and there came a great
[1:22:24] voice out of the temple of heaven from
[1:22:26] the throne saying what
[1:22:28] it
[1:22:29] is
[1:22:30] done
[1:22:32] hallelujah
[1:22:34] it is done
[1:22:36] it is finished
[1:22:38] it's over
[1:22:40] and there were voices and thunders and
[1:22:41] lightning and there was a great
[1:22:42] earthquake such as not since men were
[1:22:44] upon the earth you think california is
[1:22:46] going to be bad don't be around for this
[1:22:48] one either
[1:22:50] so mighty an earthquake and so great and
[1:22:52] the great city was divided into three
[1:22:54] parts and the cities of the nations fell
[1:22:58] this is the wrath of god folks
[1:23:00] this is not an amateur tribulation this
[1:23:02] is the wrath of god poured out on people
[1:23:05] that do not care about god
[1:23:08] and the great city was divided into
[1:23:09] three parts and the cities of the
[1:23:11] nations fell and great babylon came in
[1:23:13] remembrance before god to give unto her
[1:23:15] the cup of the wine of the fierceness
[1:23:18] of his wrath and every island fled away
[1:23:21] and the mountains were not found and
[1:23:23] there fell upon men of great hail out of
[1:23:25] heaven sounds like a
[1:23:26] pretty good
[1:23:28] nuclear war
[1:23:29] every stone about the weight of a talent
[1:23:31] men blasphemed god because of the plague
[1:23:33] of the hail for the plague thereof was
[1:23:34] exceeding
[1:23:36] great wow let's don't be here during
[1:23:38] that time
[1:23:40] just a few more
[1:23:42] victory day
[1:23:46] we talk about it we've had several wars
[1:23:48] the wars and rumors of wars v days v
[1:23:51] days and v days in other words victory
[1:23:52] day and it finally winds up into the
[1:23:54] great battle of armageddon
[1:23:56] that'll be the last of it when she comes
[1:23:58] to the battle of armageddon that'll
[1:24:00] settle the whole thing
[1:24:03] just before the great millennium
[1:24:04] armageddon is to clean off the earth
[1:24:07] she re-purifies herself with what this
[1:24:10] atomic blowing
[1:24:12] and the volcanic ash and things sink
[1:24:14] this soaked blood of men and upon the
[1:24:16] earth and sin and crime she sinks
[1:24:19] beneath the earth and the volcanic
[1:24:20] braids out again and renews and cleans
[1:24:23] the earth for the great
[1:24:25] millennium he cleans his church during
[1:24:27] that time for people to live here amen i
[1:24:29] like that see there's coming a time
[1:24:32] when it will be
[1:24:33] great let's go to ezekiel 40.
[1:24:38] now after the battle of armageddon
[1:24:41] somebody's come and got to build a
[1:24:43] temple according to the bible between
[1:24:45] that time
[1:24:47] and the time that we ride in revelations
[1:24:48] 19 when we ride back into the temple
[1:24:51] there's got to be a temple built
[1:24:52] sometime to finish daniel 70 weeks
[1:24:54] because what it is to daniel's people
[1:24:57] and
[1:24:59] the city thank you
[1:25:01] they're going to build a city
[1:25:04] because they need a city not you say
[1:25:05] they need well
[1:25:07] they're jews
[1:25:08] god promised he'd raise up the people
[1:25:11] and the city
[1:25:13] amen
[1:25:14] in the five and twentieth year of their
[1:25:15] captivity the beginning of the year and
[1:25:17] the tenth day of the month and the
[1:25:18] fourteenth year after that the city was
[1:25:19] smitten and the self same day the hand
[1:25:21] of the lord was upon me now this is
[1:25:23] ezekiel
[1:25:24] and brought me thither
[1:25:26] thither
[1:25:27] in the visions of god he brought me into
[1:25:30] the land of where
[1:25:33] what in new york when chicago
[1:25:37] israel
[1:25:38] and set me up on a very high mountain by
[1:25:40] which was at the frame of a city on the
[1:25:42] south and he brought me feather and
[1:25:44] behold there was a man
[1:25:45] whose appearance was like the appearance
[1:25:47] of brass
[1:25:48] with a line of flax in his hand in the
[1:25:50] measuring reed and he stood in the gate
[1:25:51] and a man said unto me son of man behold
[1:25:54] with thine eyes and hear with thine ears
[1:25:56] and set thine heart upon all that i
[1:25:58] shall show thee in other words
[1:26:00] don't miss what i'm telling you
[1:26:03] because i'm going to give you the exact
[1:26:05] if you'll if you read ezekiel 40 through
[1:26:07] 44
[1:26:09] it's not boring to read that but it's
[1:26:11] dimensions
[1:26:13] and rooms and where this is going to be
[1:26:15] placed and where that's going to be
[1:26:17] placed that temple is going to be built
[1:26:19] in before the millennium
[1:26:21] by somebody and it can't be us
[1:26:25] we don't build temples
[1:26:27] the jews build temples son of man behold
[1:26:29] thine ears and hear without hear eyes
[1:26:31] and hear with our ears and set the heart
[1:26:33] upon all that i shall show thee for to
[1:26:35] the intent that i might show them unto
[1:26:38] thee are thou brought hither
[1:26:40] declare all that thou see us
[1:26:44] to the house of the gentiles
[1:26:47] no
[1:26:48] to the house of israel
[1:26:50] has nothing to do with us
[1:26:53] nothing to do with us
[1:26:55] all right revelations 19
[1:26:57] 11.
[1:26:59] now remember we read revelations 19
[1:27:01] where the marriage of the lamb has come
[1:27:02] and the bride has made or his wife has
[1:27:04] made herself ready right
[1:27:06] now we're reading the last part of
[1:27:07] revelations 19 and i saw heaven open so
[1:27:11] we must have been in another dimension
[1:27:13] and behold a white horse and he that sat
[1:27:14] on him was called faithful and true and
[1:27:16] in righteousness he does judge and make
[1:27:18] war

[1:27:21] many crowns and he had a name written
[1:27:23] that no one knew but he himself and he
[1:27:25] was clothed with a vesture dipped in
[1:27:27] blood

[1:27:32] word and the word was with god and the
[1:27:33] word was god and that word was made
[1:27:35] flesh which was who jesus christ
[1:27:38] so that's who that is if you didn't know
[1:27:40] that and the armies which were in heaven
[1:27:42] followed him upon white horses clothed
[1:27:45] in fine linen white and clean that's me
[1:27:48] and you
[1:27:50] and out of his mouth goes with a sharp
[1:27:51] sword word
[1:27:53] that with it he should smite the nations
[1:27:55] he shall rule them with rod of iron and
[1:27:57] he treadeth the wine press of the
[1:27:58] fearless and wrath of almighty god i'm
[1:28:00] trying to hurry and he hath on his
[1:28:02] vesture and on his thigh name written
[1:28:04] king of kings
[1:28:06] and lord of lords and we know those are

[1:29:12] come
[1:29:14] oh the church age ending is blacked out
[1:29:16] the bride is called
[1:29:18] we have already entered the tribulation
[1:29:20] that's the question no no no i wish that
[1:29:23] i could just have more time on that see
[1:29:25] the bride
[1:29:26] when she's taken from the church then
[1:29:28] the church age will cease
[1:29:30] laodicea goes into chaos the bride goes
[1:29:33] to glory
[1:29:34] to the marriage supper
[1:29:36] and the tribulation period sets in upon
[1:29:38] the sleeping virgins
[1:29:40] what the five foolish for three and a
[1:29:42] half years while israel is getting its
[1:29:44] prophecy which is what three and a half
[1:29:46] years
[1:29:47] then the tribulation sets in upon israel
[1:29:49] jacob's trouble
[1:29:50] then comes the battle of armageddon
[1:29:52] which destroys all things
[1:29:54] and then the bride returns back with the
[1:29:56] groom for a thousand years the
[1:29:58] millennium reign
[1:30:00] after that comes the white throne
[1:30:01] judgment after that the new heaven and
[1:30:03] the earth and the new city coming down
[1:30:04] from god out of heaven eternity
[1:30:07] and time
[1:30:08] blends together
[1:30:11] now we'll head into the millennium
[1:30:13] on sunday
[1:30:17] and we'll see how glorious the time
[1:30:18] let's stand our feet how glorious the
[1:30:19] time that is
[1:30:24] because when we come back onto this
[1:30:25] earth folks in revelations 19 it ain't
[1:30:27] going to look the same
[1:30:29] it's going to look totally different
[1:30:31] there's not going to be
[1:30:33] there's not going to be
[1:30:34] sin
[1:30:37] devil we're going to read he's going to
[1:30:38] be bound for a thousand years and all
[1:30:39] his little amps are going to be bound
[1:30:41] you're not going to worry about no virus
[1:30:42] you're not going to worry about going to
[1:30:44] work you don't have to worry about pains
[1:30:45] or aches
[1:30:47] everything's going to be put back the
[1:30:48] way it's supposed to be but now remember
[1:30:54] the millennium is still in time
[1:30:57] everybody got that the millennium is
[1:30:59] still in time so it's not it's eternal
[1:31:01] redemption is not over yet
[1:31:04] okay has everybody got that
[1:31:06] a thousand years is gonna have to be
[1:31:08] lived by somebody to prove the sin curse
[1:31:10] is over with so there's gonna have to be
[1:31:12] day night day night 1000 years and then
[1:31:16] at the end of that thousand years
[1:31:18] we'll see that there'll be a another
[1:31:20] battle
[1:31:21] then there'll be a white throne judgment
[1:31:23] then there'll be a future home that's
[1:31:25] when
[1:31:26] eternity
[1:31:28] eternal plan of redemption
[1:31:30] will be over
[1:31:32] people be given eternal life at the
[1:31:33] white throne judgment and they'll enter
[1:31:35] into eternity
