[3:18] of night by night nor for arrow that
[3:22] fires by day
[3:33] a thousand shall fall at the side and

[8:43] only I want to see
[8:48] [Music]
[8:51] amen
[8:52] god bless you this morning each time I
[8:55] hear that song I remember there was a
[8:58] minister who came after that song and he
[9:02] just dropped the little thought in there
[9:03] and he says you know you can't get holy
[9:06] in a hurry it takes time to be holy it
[9:11] takes time to be in the presence of God
[9:14] and let that Shekinah glory just come
[9:17] and bathe bathe all the way down through
[9:20] your soul so I'd like to get started
[9:22] right away but I want to give greetings
[9:24] from our church from brother Bisco each
[9:27] time I speak with him he reminds me of
[9:29] the the great meetings that your
[9:31] assembly put on when we had here is one
[9:33] of the finest meetings that I've ever
[9:36] been a part of and the the the forum
[9:39] that it was in it was wonderful the
[9:42] reception that we had was wonderful and
[9:45] it was just one of the one of the most
[9:47] memorable weekend's that I've ever had
[9:49] and you know I love coming here and
[9:52] sometimes when you come to a church
[9:55] every church has an atmosphere and those
[10:00] of you who attend here be very very
[10:03] thankful because you have a church that
[10:05] has real love you know the brother
[10:09] branham talked about the kind of love
[10:12] the the eros and the filio and the agapo
[10:16] and they say that the closest that a man
[10:18] or a woman ever comes to agapo love is
[10:21] when they received their first child and
[10:24] I've never had that experience but I've
[10:26] had many people say well that's the
[10:28] truth you know when you have that love
[10:30] and it's it's like super filial love and
[10:33] semi agape love so you folks here you
[10:37] have that kind of a love one for another
[10:39] and for your pastor and his family but
[10:43] most of all for the word I'd like to
[10:46] turn in your Bibles right away and
[10:49] invite you to second Timothy chapter 3
[10:52] and verse 1
[10:58] and Paul is speaking to Timothy who he
[11:03] loved and you know Timothy Paul said the
[11:07] Timothy was his son it was not his flesh
[11:10] and blood son but anybody that Paul had
[11:13] personally witnessed to and brought to
[11:16] the message he considered them his son
[11:18] like Philemon you know when when he was
[11:22] sending Onesimus back he says Onesimus
[11:24] my son who I've been begotten in my
[11:27] bonds so Paul had a great love for
[11:29] Timothy and here he's exhorting him this
[11:34] know also that in the last days perilous
[11:37] times shall come for men shall be lovers
[11:41] of their own selves covetous boasters
[11:44] proud blasphemers disobedient to parents
[11:50] unthankful unholy without natural
[11:54] affection trucebreakers false accusers
[11:57] incontinent fierce despisers of those
[12:01] that are good traitors heady highminded
[12:04] lovers of pleasure more than lovers of
[12:08] god having a form of godliness but
[12:12] denying the power thereof so we'll stop
[12:16] right there for a second let's bow our
[12:18] heads father we're so thankful that that
[12:24] your message is an up-to-date message
[12:27] and Lord this this epistle could have
[12:30] been written this morning so up-to-date
[12:34] father as we look around at the world
[12:36] that we are living in and the state that
[12:39] men's minds have gotten into and how
[12:41] Paul describes them this is going to be
[12:44] in the last days that this mandate is
[12:47] going to have that man are going to be
[12:50] they want to be God's in their own mind
[12:52] and lovers of pleasure and despisers of
[12:56] those that are good lord I pray that you
[12:58] would you would give us the the essence
[13:02] of what Paul is saying and as we
[13:04] describe it to the day and the
[13:06] challenges that we are living in and the
[13:09] challenges that we face how
[13:11] Plus father to be able to to get the
[13:15] essence of it and let each person
[13:17] let them gird himself a little bit
[13:20] tighter father as we approach the
[13:22] oncoming storms and we know that we will
[13:25] crest every way by faith we ask these
[13:28] blessings and your precious and holy
[13:31] name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[13:34] amen amen
[13:36] god bless you you can have your seats
[13:37] and I'd like to speak this morning on a
[13:43] subject that that God just dropped into
[13:45] my heart and the subject is invasion
[13:50] insanity and deliverance and truly as we
[13:55] look around the world we can say that
[13:57] today the world truly has become an
[14:01] insane asylum and the inmates are
[14:03] running the asylum and that as a
[14:07] believer and last night I was listening
[14:09] before I went to bed and I was listening
[14:11] once again to the message brother
[14:14] Branham preached on super-sense
[14:16] and you know a lot of people outside of
[14:19] the message we in the message we have
[14:22] the opportunity if we dig deep enough we
[14:25] have the opportunity to understand the
[14:28] supernatural world that we're living in
[14:31] because you know we are pilgrims aliens
[14:34] and strangers down here there were
[14:36] citizens of a supernatural civilization
[14:39] and you know I've often thought all
[14:41] these people that are UFO UFO people
[14:44] they call them ufologist and they're out
[14:46] there and they're looking for people
[14:48] from another planet and they've got
[14:50] these telescopes and they've got these
[14:52] great listening devices and they're
[14:54] trying to define these sound signals
[14:56] coming in from another planet well I can
[14:58] walk up to him I say hey
[15:00] you don't have to look there I think
[15:01] Here I am right here and let me tell you
[15:04] IIIi have got some signals from another
[15:08] world that are absolutely you want to
[15:11] talk about a higher intelligence I'll
[15:13] give you the higher intelligence that
[15:15] you're looking for and in the you know
[15:17] you're always wondering how our
[15:18] government would receive these people if
[15:20] they came from another dimension or
[15:23] another another planet well
[15:25] I want to know how are you going to
[15:27] receive me because I'm from another
[15:29] world and I've been alive for a long
[15:32] time I've been I've been around since
[15:34] before the foundation of the world in
[15:36] the mind of God I was I was as real then
[15:39] as I am right now standing before you
[15:42] and and so brother Branham is talking
[15:45] about the super sense and so we as
[15:49] believers we have the privilege and the
[15:51] opportunity to understand how we are
[15:55] wired but the world they don't
[15:59] understand that they just go by their
[16:01] emotions they go by their feeling they
[16:04] go by their intelligence or their
[16:06] knowledge and they have goals and they
[16:08] set goals and by human ability they're
[16:10] out there and they're able to churn
[16:12] through and maybe drive over people walk
[16:14] over people whatever it takes to achieve
[16:16] their goals and and they're just driven
[16:19] they call them you know that type a
[16:21] personality you know and other people
[16:23] you know real docile and real humble and
[16:26] you know they just kind of casual about
[16:29] life but you know if you're casual about
[16:31] life you're gonna be a casualty and if
[16:33] you're casual about this message you're
[16:36] going to be a casualty
[16:37] and so as believers I know when I wake
[16:40] up in the morning I know there's got to
[16:42] be two deaths today I got to die and the
[16:46] devil's got to die and so the best thing
[16:48] to do is to is to stop the yapping of
[16:52] that dog first thing in the morning just
[16:54] bind him and don't wait until he brings
[16:57] the attack on you you go and bring the
[17:00] attack on him and bind him first thing
[17:03] in the morning because the Bible tells
[17:04] us if we resist the devil he will flee
[17:07] from us and in my mind what would I have
[17:10] in my mind when the devil comes I had my
[17:13] mind I'm here in one of these Georgia
[17:15] southern plantations and I'm up on the
[17:18] porch and all of a sudden this dog
[17:20] there's a rabid dog he comes up there
[17:22] and he's growling and and all the foams
[17:25] coming out of his mouth and and you can
[17:27] see his teeth and you know if he could
[17:29] get a hold of you he would do damage to
[17:31] your leg but I also know if I went over
[17:35] and got a big old pot of boiling
[17:37] water and I just walked over there and
[17:39] dump that water on that rabid dog what
[17:43] do you think would be the results of
[17:45] that dog he would flee he would be
[17:48] running he'd be yelling he'll yell and
[17:50] that's what we have the privilege of
[17:53] doing with the name of Jesus Christ the
[17:56] blood of Jesus Christ praise prayer
[17:59] power righteousness all these things
[18:01] they are weapons of our warfare and so
[18:05] as we begin to dissect I want to go I'm
[18:08] going to do part one this morning in
[18:10] part two this afternoon and I just don't
[18:13] want to get in a hurry because I just
[18:14] want to lay this in so so if you took an
[18:18] egg and you looked at that egg by
[18:20] experience you know that the egg has a
[18:23] shell but you also know there is an egg
[18:26] white in there and as egg yolk in there
[18:28] well the human being is much like the
[18:31] egg we have a shell we have a physical
[18:37] exterior brother Branham says it's by
[18:39] those five senses that we contact the
[18:43] world the outside world and so we have
[18:46] our eye we'll go through our eyes and
[18:48] ears first a person would be very
[18:51] handicapped without the ability to see
[18:54] and they'd be handicapped if they could
[18:57] not hear now just an admonition we have
[19:01] got to be super vigilant as to what we
[19:04] allow to come into our eyes and into our
[19:07] ears because the greatest power that man
[19:10] has been given is the power of choice we
[19:14] choose we can choose God or we can
[19:17] choose the world one or the other but
[19:20] you know when you choose God you put you
[19:23] put a guard on your eyes because once
[19:26] you allow something by choice to go into
[19:30] your eyes or into your ears
[19:33] it takes an instantaneous journey to the
[19:37] back road of your mind and they're in
[19:39] the back road of your mind is produce a
[19:43] thought and thoughts become words and
[19:47] words produced actions and actions form
[19:49] habits habits
[19:51] produces character and character
[19:53] determines your destiny but how did it
[19:56] start it started by a choice that you
[19:59] made to look at something read something
[20:02] watch something hear something these are
[20:05] choices that you made you know brother
[20:07] Branham it when he talked about gossip
[20:10] y'all talking about nailing something he
[20:12] said we now listen when you go around
[20:14] and you start gossiping about your
[20:17] neighbour you do it Melissa
[20:18] he said just mark it down the Holy Ghost
[20:22] has just left you
[20:25] he can't stand that kind of a spirit he
[20:29] said now he's not gone far away he's
[20:32] just out on on the tree on that limb of
[20:35] the tree he said how do you get him to
[20:37] come back again just become a lamb again
[20:40] and the dove of God will come back and
[20:43] and live in that nature of a lamb and so
[20:47] now we go to eyes or ears then we go to
[20:50] our taste and our touch and our smell
[20:52] many people they are that they are they
[20:55] are abducted by Satan with their sense
[20:59] of touch you know in in the world that
[21:01] we're living if you just break it down
[21:03] and hope you remember this the world at
[21:06] large if it looks good they want to look
[21:09] at it if it sounds good
[21:11] they want to listen to it if it tastes
[21:13] good and smells good they want to eat it
[21:15] and if it feels good they want to touch
[21:17] it and they want to touch it and touch
[21:19] it and touch it that's where many people
[21:22] fall many people there in the flesh and
[21:25] the lust of the flesh the lust of the
[21:28] eyes it traps them and they become
[21:31] addicted to it and they don't know in
[21:33] their own natural mind you know they can
[21:36] try to reform them so I remember how
[21:38] many times when I was a kid when they
[21:40] started coming out was smoking is danger
[21:43] how many times I tried to quit smoking I
[21:46] quit smoking for a day a week a month
[21:49] three months I used to get a little bit
[21:51] pen the size of a cigarette and put that
[21:53] thing in my pock and pull that thing out
[21:55] you know because I knew after I ate
[21:57] there was that sensation I needed and it
[22:00] was more something to do with your hands
[22:02] and it was not until I had my first
[22:05] experience with God in a little Southern
[22:07] Baptist Church in Winter Park Florida I
[22:10] will never forget that blessed man
[22:12] brother JC Mitchell and I mean if you
[22:15] would have go to Hollywood and cast a
[22:17] Southern Baptist minister
[22:19] it would have been brother JC Mitchell
[22:22] he was about six foot three weighed
[22:24] about 220 had a shock of white hair back
[22:27] there and he would preach and I when he
[22:30] preached that message about God's divine
[22:32] judgment for the sinner he was reading
[22:35] my mail I was all the way in the back
[22:37] row of the balcony I was just there
[22:39] trying to make a sale from some
[22:41] customers and that were going to buy
[22:43] something and they invited me to come to
[22:45] church now coming from a Catholic
[22:47] background I walked in that Baptist
[22:49] Church no Saints no angels no crosses no
[22:53] holding water no candle nothing I said
[22:55] this must be a pretty poor Church you
[22:57] know they don't have much in here and
[22:59] and it was kind of strange so I said all
[23:02] the way in the back row of the balcony I
[23:04] was the only one back there and when
[23:06] that preacher when he began to preach
[23:08] and he was a pointer and when he pointed
[23:10] he was pointing like that he was
[23:12] pointing right at me and I'm talking
[23:13] just reading my life you know by every
[23:16] standard of what a sinner was he nailed
[23:19] it and then cinched it since the nail
[23:22] and I mean I was shaking the whole back
[23:24] row was vibrating and so but that day
[23:27] after that experience I walked out and
[23:30] the desire first the very desire for
[23:34] cigarettes was gone the desire for
[23:37] alcohol and I was not a big drinker I
[23:39] didn't even like the taste of alcohol
[23:41] but I drank with my friends because it
[23:43] was the thing to do I even gone to the
[23:45] point I used to get a bottle I called
[23:47] that slow Gin Fizz it was a little red
[23:49] ball and I would take that little tiny
[23:51] bit of sloe gin and put it in some
[23:53] ginger ale and stir it around and so I
[23:55] walked around with a dress you couldn't
[23:57] you could drink a whole gallon of that
[23:59] stuff and nothing but people oh he he's
[24:01] drinking slow Gin Fizz that wasn't an
[24:04] oddball but if I hadn't drunk they would
[24:06] have thought something was strange
[24:06] that's the atmosphere the environment I
[24:09] was living in you know some people say
[24:13] that you know the problem with my son or
[24:15] my daughter
[24:16] they got involved with the wrong crowd
[24:18] anybody ever hear that well back when I
[24:21] was young that was me I was the wrong
[24:23] crowd and the whole bunch of us that
[24:25] were running around we were the wrong
[24:27] crowd and we didn't know anything about
[24:29] positive attitude and we didn't know
[24:31] anything about about love and none of
[24:33] those things so anyways the desire for
[24:35] drinking and desire for smoking the
[24:37] desire for all those the desire for a
[24:40] goal into the horse track and going to
[24:41] the dog that was gone and I mean I
[24:44] walked out of that church and I'd asked
[24:46] the pastor I said is what you're saying
[24:48] here the true that if I'll ask Jesus
[24:50] Christ into my heart cause he read
[24:51] second Corinthians 5:17 If any man is in
[24:54] Christ is a new creature old things are
[24:56] passed away behold all things become new
[24:58] and then he preached God will separate
[25:00] your sins as far as the east is from the
[25:02] west into the sea of forgetfulness and
[25:04] remember them no more and now I'm a
[25:06] Catholic you know and when you want to
[25:08] get your sins forgiven you had to go to
[25:10] the priest and you had to go in the
[25:11] little box and you had to you know say a
[25:13] little greeting everybody said insane
[25:15] greeting and then you confessed your
[25:17] sins and then he said okay go say 10
[25:19] Hail Marys and 10 our fathers go to the
[25:22] altar and you say it and you walked out
[25:24] now I didn't know anything about true
[25:25] justification but that was Catholic
[25:27] justification 10 Hail Marys 10 our
[25:30] Father walk no problem it's all gone so
[25:33] I had an idea about what justification
[25:35] could be until I found out in the
[25:38] message what justification really was
[25:40] you know I just dropped this thing you
[25:42] know there's two things that I know of
[25:45] that God cannot do number one he cannot
[25:50] fail and number two he cannot find sin
[25:55] that has been confessed and is in the
[25:58] bleach under the blood of Jesus Christ
[26:00] cannot find that sin now if we could if
[26:04] we if each one of us could just walk out
[26:06] of here today
[26:07] with that understanding that our sins
[26:10] our past is truly gone dead buried never
[26:14] to be remembered again it's the greatest
[26:17] gift that a believer has when it come to
[26:20] the message is the relief of the guilt
[26:22] and the shame and the condemnation of
[26:24] our path it is gone and for most people
[26:28] it takes a while
[26:30] for that to really sink in and for Pete
[26:33] I know people in the message it still
[26:34] hasn't sunk in yet and the devil still
[26:37] beats them up every day comes with that
[26:40] Club brings up the past you know what I
[26:42] tell the devil you want to bring up my
[26:44] past let me tell you I want to bring up
[26:46] your past and I remind him of what he
[26:49] does and all the murders and all the
[26:51] sins and all the all the alcoholics and
[26:53] all the murders and everything that he
[26:56] has been the problem he's been the
[26:58] source of it all I said yeah I got a
[27:00] pass but I tell you my past is gone your
[27:03] past is still with you and I got a
[27:05] future let me remind you of your future
[27:08] in the lake of fire and you know what
[27:10] the devil don't like to hear that they
[27:12] do not like to hear that you know in
[27:15] Ephesians let's turn to Ephesians real
[27:17] quick before I go any further
[27:19] just as a found a in Ephesians chapter 6
[27:22] and verse 10 very familiar this this is
[27:27] something that every believer it I mean
[27:29] it should be a verse that is memorize
[27:31] scripture finally my brethren be strong
[27:34] in the Lord and then the power of his
[27:36] might put on the whole armor of a god
[27:39] now you know what this is not a
[27:40] suggestion this is not just good advice
[27:43] or something you might want to do every
[27:46] once in a while every day friends do you
[27:51] know you would not consider me if
[27:53] somebody I mean there's a lot of crazy
[27:55] people walking around almost nude but if
[27:58] somebody walked out totally nude and
[28:00] just had no clothes on they would surely
[28:02] call the men in the white coats and
[28:04] they'd have them you know a committed
[28:08] but people who walk out without the
[28:11] whole armor of God you're putting
[28:13] yourself in a very vulnerable position
[28:16] because as a believer when you wake up
[28:19] in the morning you've got a bull's-eye
[28:21] on your back and every demon every
[28:24] principality every power everyone in the
[28:27] neighborhood knows who you are they got
[28:30] your address your email address they got
[28:32] everything about you they got a whole
[28:34] they got a whole dossier on everything
[28:37] you've ever done every weakness you've
[28:39] got every time they've ever tricked you
[28:41] and believe
[28:42] they have been tricking and deceiving
[28:44] men for 6,000 years
[28:46] they are precision deceivers and if they
[28:49] can't do it by themselves they'll go and
[28:52] get a whole gang of them and they'll
[28:53] come and they'll have a joint assault on
[28:56] you and sometimes the assault may come
[28:59] from your family from those that you
[29:00] love those that don't understand you
[29:03] those that misunderstand you so he says
[29:06] put on the whole armor of God that you
[29:09] may be the stand against the wiles that
[29:11] word wiles it means the cunning devices
[29:15] that you may stand against the cunning
[29:17] devices of the devil for we wrestle not
[29:21] against flesh and blood for a lot of us
[29:24] is a good thing I wouldn't want to go an
[29:26] arm wrestle with some of these guys that
[29:28] go to the gyms and they get all bulked
[29:30] up and they sit there they look yourself
[29:32] in the mirror I wouldn't want to wrestle
[29:34] with those guys we don't wrestle against
[29:37] flesh and blood we wrestle against
[29:39] something that is so much more powerful
[29:42] we wrestle against the powers against
[29:48] the rulers of the darkness of this world
[29:50] against spiritual wickedness in high
[29:52] places
[29:53] wherefore take unto you the whole armour
[29:55] of God that you may believe 'old a this
[29:59] is the evil day this is more evil than
[30:01] any other day that's ever been this is
[30:04] more evil
[30:05] the Bible's as it was in the days of
[30:08] Sodom so shall it be in the days of the
[30:10] coming of the Son of Man and if somebody
[30:12] cannot see that we are living in the
[30:14] days of Sodom something is wrong with
[30:17] them and so having a that you may bless
[30:21] that withstand in the evil day and
[30:23] having done all the stands stand
[30:24] therefore having your loins Girt about
[30:26] with what with truth that's a part of
[30:29] your armor that the truth is God's
[30:31] exclamation point and this message is
[30:34] God's exclamation point it's truth at a
[30:38] very high supernatural level and so the
[30:41] truth is the first weapon that we talked
[30:44] about here having your loins Girt about
[30:46] with truth having on the breastplate of
[30:48] righteousness and only God can give you
[30:51] true righteousness you know the most of
[30:54] the world they don't even
[30:56] understand or no they don't know how
[30:58] many gods there are so how can they have
[31:02] righteousness I talked to people and him
[31:05] the brother who witnessed to me about
[31:07] the UPC and brought me out of Trinity he
[31:10] had the whole Bible memorized took him
[31:12] 16 years and the first I asked him about
[31:15] brother Branham he's a homo boy brother
[31:18] and he watched that serpent seed don't
[31:20] let it get you know I hadn't even I
[31:22] didn't even know what a serpent seed was
[31:23] at that time I had just met Arnie a few
[31:26] days before that so here's the guy that
[31:28] got the whole Bible memorized and I mean
[31:31] it was true I watched him preach I
[31:34] listened to him i cross-referenced his
[31:36] messages it was he walked up there and
[31:39] he would pre he use a hundred scripture
[31:41] it was like a performance but he was
[31:45] lost in Genesis 3 and Genesis 3 he took
[31:50] a left-hand turn and that left-hand turn
[31:53] net he'll never ever ever hit the target
[31:56] never
[31:57] it's like brother brother Sam was
[32:00] telling me he had the sight in
[32:01] somebody's gun I think it was brother
[32:03] Jules gun that's what's the problem
[32:05] but brother branham talked about he said
[32:07] if your site is off just a little bit
[32:09] here you're never going to hit the
[32:10] target and it is impossible to hit the
[32:14] target without the message and without
[32:17] somebody who can break the word of life
[32:20] to you yeah I know people who don't they
[32:22] don't think we ought to have preachers I
[32:24] would shudder to think I love the
[32:27] message I love the tapes I love the
[32:29] voice but I would shudder to think how
[32:31] bankrupt I would be without all of the
[32:35] insight and the knowledge that men of
[32:37] God who have looked at the word like a
[32:40] diamond and they've gone and they have
[32:42] attacked or they brought forth this
[32:45] little jewel or this little nugget of
[32:48] the diamond and and you know it's the
[32:50] worst the Bible plus the message plus
[32:53] the fivefold ministry brother branham
[32:55] said I laid it out there now you guys go
[32:57] and dig it up all those wonderful facets
[33:00] of those diamonds coming out all the
[33:02] types and the shadows in the mysteries
[33:04] and the way they would just take bring
[33:06] things out it's one
[33:09] it's the mystical body of Jesus Christ
[33:12] you're a mystic in the the definition of
[33:14] a mystic that's one who's who seeks
[33:18] after and attains direct intercourse
[33:25] with God
[33:27] that's a mystic and the bride is the
[33:30] only truth that the new world they get a
[33:33] whole bunch of false mystics but the
[33:36] bride are the only true mystics in the
[33:38] world
[33:39] they seek after and they attain direct
[33:43] intercourse with God one of my favorite
[33:47] thoughts is this Bible it's a
[33:48] supernatural multiplication of
[33:51] inspiration and revelation for
[33:53] communication with God when you know
[33:56] this word and you know this message you
[33:58] are linked up with omnipotence linked up
[34:02] with infallibility God's got a
[34:05] supernatural transport system waiting
[34:08] for you just just like Elijah had one
[34:12] that we got a same kind of transport
[34:15] system waiting for us it will either
[34:17] before at the rapture or if it's a grave
[34:20] out of the grave and we're going to be
[34:22] there
[34:23] living a lie eternity you can't even you
[34:27] can't even begin to imagine because
[34:30] eternity has no time and we're never
[34:33] going to be bored for all of eternity
[34:35] there's going to be something to know
[34:37] something to learn maybe we won't be
[34:40] learning about galaxies that are you
[34:42] know in our mind maybe there are zillion
[34:44] trillion miles away or light-years away
[34:46] from us we're going to be riding the
[34:48] word through the word oh my what a
[34:51] privilege friends yeah brother branham
[34:55] often says I he's I wonder if we are
[34:58] sufficiently impressed with what God is
[35:02] doing amongst us and then brother ray
[35:06] know a lot of people they were going too
[35:08] far with brother Branham in his ministry
[35:10] and thinking that he was a big somebody
[35:12] and brother branham he says you know you
[35:16] always talk about the people that go too
[35:18] far but you don't talk about the people
[35:21] who don't go
[35:22] are enough and we understand what what
[35:25] brother Branham was he is a brother
[35:27] our precious brother he was Elijah to
[35:30] this day he was anointed to take us all
[35:33] the way back to the faith of our fathers
[35:35] and then forward into a rapture we had
[35:39] to go back to the faith of our fathers
[35:41] first and to understand that but now
[35:43] we're living in an elevated supernatural
[35:47] age and you can go there anytime that
[35:51] you want to of what you want to all you
[35:53] got to do is close your eyes you see and
[35:57] so here we are we're told now let me
[35:59] just finish this having your feet shed
[36:01] with the preparation of the gospel of
[36:03] peace above all taking the shield of
[36:05] faith wherewith you shall be able to
[36:07] quench all the fiery darts of the wicked
[36:09] and take the helmet of salvation and the
[36:11] sword of the Spirit which is the word of
[36:14] God and so you're going out you're a
[36:16] soldier you got your sword you got your
[36:19] shield and remember all your all your
[36:21] armor is front armor there's nothing on
[36:24] the back there's not a card if you run
[36:27] the devil's got an open shot at you the
[36:30] Bible you know when you're in the middle
[36:32] of a great trial when you've done all
[36:34] the stand stand you know if I stand I
[36:38] might be in the greatest trial the devil
[36:40] cannot make me raise my arm if I don't
[36:43] want to raise my arm he can't make me
[36:45] raise my feet if I just want to stand in
[36:48] the middle of a trial and wait for God
[36:51] to move or wait for God to give me
[36:53] instruction on how to move I'm going to
[36:55] stand a brother Ram said you know when
[36:58] you raise your hand
[36:59] that's a supernatural act that's a
[37:01] decision that you made to lift your hand
[37:03] up to God that's what we want to lift
[37:06] our hands up to holy hands with praise
[37:08] and thanksgiving and so now as a human
[37:11] being your eyes your ears your taste
[37:13] your touch and your smell now that's
[37:15] just the outside and most people they
[37:18] live in that realm looks good look at it
[37:21] sounds good listen to it smells good
[37:24] tastes good eat it
[37:25] feels good do it and see each one of
[37:29] those compartments of your physical life
[37:31] they're an intricate compartment
[37:34] your eyes are so much different than
[37:37] your ears and your smell and your taste
[37:40] is so much different than your touch but
[37:43] and we do all of them simultaneous we
[37:45] don't even think about it
[37:47] we do them natural just unconscious you
[37:49] know you walk around do things go over
[37:51] there but put the oven on put the boiler
[37:53] you know again it automatically without
[37:56] even thinking oh what treasures our eyes
[38:01] our ears are here this people that have
[38:05] gone through treatment medical treatment
[38:07] they have no sense of taste
[38:09] they have no smell everything tastes the
[38:12] same and the only reason they eat is for
[38:15] calories just to keep their body could
[38:17] you imagine having no taste no smell
[38:20] there's people who have been that
[38:22] they've lost their arms and their legs
[38:24] and battle they don't have the sensation
[38:26] of touch sometimes people know the price
[38:31] of everything and the value of nothing
[38:33] so now we'll go a little bit deeper
[38:35] let's go into the second round
[38:38] your brother Branham says that that that
[38:41] first realm is a physical it's like the
[38:44] first pull and you are only as safe as
[38:49] the realm that you choose to dwell in
[38:54] now in the spiritual realm you're
[38:58] conscious yeah I think about what a gift
[39:01] our conscience is to us when it's
[39:04] cleaned when it's scoured out when
[39:07] there's no guilt there's there's nothing
[39:09] in there to hold you back from that
[39:11] personal relationship with God you can
[39:14] come there and you can get on your hands
[39:16] and say father as the son would come to
[39:19] his father and even though you know
[39:21] because you know in your mind what you
[39:24] were before God just allows us to
[39:26] remember that to understand what he has
[39:29] done for us and so here your conscience
[39:33] and your conscience I call it's like a
[39:35] double-edged sword over here is a sinner
[39:38] his life is full with sin debauchery
[39:44] anger bitterness wrath jealousy strife
[39:47] all
[39:48] those things and he's liable to do
[39:51] anything he has no conscience of what
[39:54] how it's going to affect somebody if he
[39:57] does something to them people can go and
[39:59] they can they can rob some they can go
[40:01] to a little old lady on the street and
[40:03] grab her purse and run away they did a
[40:07] survey awhile ago brother Wade in New
[40:09] York City and they asked the women if
[40:11] you were going to get mugged because
[40:12] getting mugged in New York City is the
[40:14] reality if you're gonna get mugged would
[40:17] you rather they take your wallet your
[40:19] pocketbook or your cellphone 90% said
[40:23] take my wallet
[40:24] take pick my pocketbook don't want to
[40:26] lose their cellphone with all their
[40:29] contacts and all that that's their
[40:30] communication system and they they be
[40:32] like they're on another planet without
[40:34] that that thing and so now that the
[40:37] conscience conscience that is clean what
[40:40] a gift that is to a human being I know I
[40:46] said it before a lot of people think
[40:47] that there are a human being that's come
[40:49] to earth to have a spiritual experience
[40:51] but in reality we are all supernatural
[40:55] beings and we've come to earth to have a
[40:57] human experience and that human
[40:59] experience is to overcome the eyes the
[41:01] ears that taste the touch and the smell
[41:04] and then your conscience is all cleaned
[41:06] out and then your memory a memory what a
[41:09] double-edged sword that memory is you
[41:12] know and I I've tried to exercise my
[41:15] memory especially when I was going
[41:17] through a trial with my feet had a lot
[41:19] of time on my own a lot of time in the
[41:21] house a lot of time studying and praying
[41:23] and I try to do exercise and I tried to
[41:26] stretch my memory tried to think back as
[41:28] far as I could and I can remember not
[41:31] much but I can remember my mother's
[41:34] sister when I was four years old I can
[41:37] remember her taking me out she had a
[41:39] black Buick taking me out for ice cream
[41:41] and candy and my grandmother showed me
[41:44] the picture I had a little gray suit on
[41:46] with a little gray cap getting ready to
[41:48] go into that black that black car so I
[41:51] can remember I can remember my first
[41:53] grade teacher in Catholic school I
[41:55] remember what her name is
[41:57] I can remember the first priest that I
[41:59] ever had First Communion
[42:00] now I didn't always
[42:02] remember that I had to exercise my
[42:05] memory see so it's a double-edged sword
[42:07] because Satan wants to use your memory
[42:11] to club you over the head with but God
[42:14] he wants you to remember his promises to
[42:17] you he wants to remember who you are in
[42:20] Christ you're a king's kid
[42:22] kings and priests unto God you're you're
[42:26] the elite of God by the grace of God
[42:28] you're the most blessed people we are
[42:31] that have ever walked planet Earth no
[42:33] other generation has had what we have in
[42:35] this day the understanding I remember
[42:38] when the computer first came out and her
[42:40] little little ebooks came out oh we
[42:43] thought we're a big timer had the
[42:44] message in this little little mini
[42:46] computer then they had the one that used
[42:48] to roll the scripture - oh man that was
[42:50] big time and see now we got the whole
[42:52] thing on our cell phone we can read it
[42:55] listen to it understand that question
[42:57] cross with all these things God has made
[42:59] it so simple for you to understand who
[43:03] he is and who you are in him but it has
[43:07] to be a conscious decision that you make
[43:10] a conscious choice that you make it's
[43:12] got to be a habit that you form it you
[43:15] know many people they're just they say
[43:17] I'm too busy well if we're too busy for
[43:20] God we are too busy and so here we are
[43:24] the conscience and how different is your
[43:27] conscience from your memory even though
[43:29] they sometimes intertwine your
[43:31] conscience is guilty because of the
[43:34] memories that you have but each one of
[43:36] them is like a separate if you want an
[43:38] elevator each one of them is like a
[43:40] different floor then you go down to your
[43:41] imagination
[43:42] another double-edged sword you know you
[43:45] could Satan wants to bring up your it
[43:48] wants to bring fear upon you that's what
[43:51] most people they live in a state of fear
[43:54] they live in a state of panic
[43:56] yeah I get IIIi just hear about these
[43:59] college students out there you they call
[44:01] them snowflakes you know and there I'm
[44:05] not comfortable I'm not comfortable with
[44:08] that that may be a man's coming to speak
[44:10] that's made maybe thirty thousand people
[44:13] on the campus he's going to speak five
[44:15] miles away
[44:16] and yeah I'm uncomfortable with that man
[44:19] being on the campus and and they got
[44:22] little rooms they can go to cry rooms
[44:25] now believe it or not I know corporate
[44:27] America corporate America is now
[44:29] starting to incorporate that they have
[44:32] cry rooms if their employees if they get
[44:35] intimidated if they get afraid if
[44:37] somebody speaks to them in the wrong
[44:39] manner and they get nervous they have a
[44:41] panic attack
[44:42] they have cry rooms that they can go to
[44:44] now it's gone so crazy I remember I read
[44:48] about people who were shell-shocked in
[44:49] the war and they came back and they had
[44:51] memories of horrible memories well now
[44:54] everybody that comes back from the war
[44:57] everybody's got PTSD if you travel now
[45:00] all the service I mean the service the
[45:02] guy comes walking on there got a little
[45:04] dog there's some people they've tried to
[45:07] carry on a little peacock that was there
[45:09] gonna be their service animal was a
[45:11] little pica somebody tried to carry a
[45:13] monkey on there and now there's these
[45:16] these students on college campuses the
[45:19] ones that are really stressed out
[45:21] they're allowing them to have service
[45:23] dogs to go to class with them that's the
[45:25] world that we are living in give me a
[45:28] break please give me a break
[45:30] the but that fear that fear binds people
[45:35] it paralyzes people it immobilizes them
[45:39] fear I know you hear this fear f.e.a.r
[45:42] false evidence appearing real
[45:45] false education appearing real or what
[45:50] most people do forget everything and run
[45:54] that's the new one today but the Bride
[45:59] of Christ face everything and rise
[46:01] that's who we are in this day we rise
[46:05] above the circumstances I talked to
[46:08] people well how you doing today well
[46:10] under the circumstances rise above the
[46:16] circumstances and so your conscious
[46:21] memory imagination reasoning reasoning
[46:24] all mine how many people have come and
[46:27] they've tried to reason the message
[46:29] they've tried
[46:30] I remember when I first come into the
[46:32] message and I was studying and the
[46:35] serpents eat that way one day it was
[46:37] just as crystal clear as anything and I
[46:40] go and talk to people and then they put
[46:42] that little doubt inside of me and next
[46:44] day is it really true you know I mean a
[46:48] serpent you know standing upright
[46:50] talking to even and having intercourse
[46:53] and having a I mean and I was going back
[46:57] anybody remember that
[46:58] anybody remember having to reason out
[47:01] that God sent the Prophet and that
[47:03] brother Branham was the manifestation of
[47:06] Malachi for Elijah for this generation
[47:08] and you have been chosen and selected
[47:11] and elected and protected to be ejected
[47:14] out of this world
[47:15] you are the virgin bride of Jesus Christ
[47:17] and you say me why would God choose me
[47:22] you know why we know ourselves too well
[47:26] we know other people after the flesh we
[47:29] don't know their internal work we don't
[47:32] know where they've been we don't know
[47:33] the mistakes they've made we don't know
[47:36] all the error we all as we see well
[47:38] that's brother stolen sister so-and-so
[47:40] you know or somebody at war he's a good
[47:43] man much better man than me but you've
[47:45] got a seed gene of God inside of you you
[47:49] can be quickened that's why you're an
[47:52] alien a pilgrim you look at people
[47:55] nowadays friends you look at the world
[47:58] and we are bombarded brother Branham
[48:01] said every generation for the young
[48:03] people
[48:04] he said now mothers remember this
[48:06] generation that your daughter is being
[48:08] raised up in is 10 times more difficult
[48:12] than what you were raised up in think
[48:15] about the temptation we got children
[48:18] eight and ten years old they got a
[48:20] smartphone they closed the door in their
[48:23] bedroom and they can tune in Facebook
[48:25] okay I think I'll go to India today or
[48:27] I'll go to China I'll go to Africa and
[48:30] they got the whole world in front of
[48:32] them the good the bad and the ugly and
[48:34] most of it they tuned into is the bad
[48:36] and the ugly let me tell you how nuts
[48:39] the world is they got one of these crazy
[48:40] Hollywood stars you know and
[48:43] you want to talk about egomaniacs
[48:45] narcissist you know they say the
[48:47] smallest package in the world was the
[48:49] person all wrapped up in themselves and
[48:51] this woman I mean they said to her she
[48:53] puts they call they call them selfies
[48:56] where you getting a camera and you get
[48:58] the right pose and take a picture is
[49:00] this woman brother Sam she said she has
[49:02] to take 2,000 pictures before she gets
[49:07] the right one that she wants to put on
[49:09] the Internet
[49:11] mm snaps and look I don't like that one
[49:14] another one another maybe take her all
[49:16] day and she gets one and it makes her
[49:19] look just exactly the way she wants to
[49:22] look to all of her fans you know that
[49:26] word fans made fanatics all my fanatics
[49:30] out there so reasoning we got a reason
[49:36] out the message the Bible says cast down
[49:39] reason cast down memory cast down
[49:43] imagination you know my imagination of
[49:46] God I've named my imagination it's a
[49:49] station of creation in my imagination
[49:52] it's a dream machine of excitement and
[49:55] enchantment and supernatural ecstasy
[49:57] I've even named my brain it's called the
[50:00] village of anything is possible
[50:03] see I mean that much to the world that
[50:07] sounds crazy you they say we you're
[50:10] you're enough I said I might be a nut
[50:12] but I'm screwed to the right bolt I'm
[50:14] screwed - thus sayeth the Lord friends I
[50:16] don't care what anybody says I was have
[50:20] a brother a while ago he's coming into
[50:22] the message and he's got a brother who's
[50:25] a Messianic Jew he's a Christian but now
[50:28] he's at least he's that he belongs to
[50:30] these Jews for Jesus the Jews that have
[50:32] recognized Jesus as Messiah so he says
[50:35] he said he said Ernie you need to speak
[50:37] to my rabbi my rabbi he can run rings
[50:40] around any Christian as far as theology
[50:42] here you speak to him he'll straighten
[50:44] you out I said really I said that Rev
[50:48] your rabbi he's got as much chance of
[50:51] straightening me out as the mesquita
[50:53] would of coming down and swallowing a
[50:55] whale that's how much chance
[50:57] he's got a straightening me out or
[50:59] taking me away from from this message he
[51:02] and so now your reasoning cast down
[51:05] reason and reason why God sent a prophet
[51:09] you know why you know why God sent a
[51:12] prophet because he said he was going to
[51:13] send a prophet that's why I sent the
[51:16] Prophet the Bible would be in think of
[51:19] how incomplete the word would be without
[51:22] Elijah coming how numb how dull how
[51:26] frozen desensitized people are without
[51:30] this word and then the realm of
[51:34] affections that's a great one friends
[51:37] young people nowadays you know brother
[51:40] Branham was talking in the invasion of
[51:43] the United States back in 1954 he said
[51:47] he said he he said God has ways of
[51:49] showing me things he said now he talks
[51:51] about fourteen fifteen-year-old girls he
[51:54] said what's going on and then he said
[51:56] why he says he said you'd have a better
[51:59] chance of finding a needle in a haystack
[52:01] than trying to find a virgin among these
[52:04] young girls that was 1954 friends that
[52:09] was the good old day that was the Ozzie
[52:12] and Harriet days you know little Ricky
[52:15] had a little Ricky back there you know
[52:17] so and so all these things are coming
[52:20] into total manifestation now and people
[52:23] they are addicted their feelings whether
[52:28] their feelings is for television or
[52:31] movies or music some kind of
[52:34] entertainment or whether their affection
[52:36] is maybe it's the lust the lust of the
[52:39] flesh how many you know they say it is
[52:41] it is exploding exponentially the number
[52:45] of men who are addicted to pornography
[52:48] they think they're just gonna take a
[52:50] little peek in that's it it's like
[52:53] somebody taking a shot of Crystal
[52:55] methedrine that's it it's that you know
[52:57] why because the psychologists have said
[53:00] that when they take that shot they take
[53:02] that one shot it takes them and it opens
[53:06] up a passage in their mind that man was
[53:10] never meant to go
[53:11] - it's this passage that Satan opens up
[53:14] into this temporary ecstasy and they
[53:17] feel like like they are in heaven but
[53:19] they're only there for a short time and
[53:22] when they come down from this demented
[53:25] artificial experience and they come down
[53:28] to where you and I live right now that
[53:31] seems like hell to them and you know
[53:35] what they'll do they'll rob anybody that
[53:37] robbed their mother their grandmother
[53:39] that robbed a bank
[53:41] they'll prostitute themselves anything
[53:43] they can just because they got to get
[53:45] back to heaven again wasn't meant to be
[53:49] you know how hard that is to get those
[53:51] people clean from that very few only the
[53:55] Holy Ghost can bring somebody back from
[53:58] that and we've got so many people that
[54:00] are addicted you know they've got these
[54:02] clinics now they've got a you know the
[54:04] the AAA Alcoholics Anonymous and they
[54:07] got Narcotics Anonymous then they got
[54:09] the sex anonymous you know sex addicts
[54:12] and then they got one now as crazy
[54:15] it's called beaters Anonymous it's for
[54:17] people who have domestic violence issues
[54:19] and the judge makes them go to court and
[54:22] have to go to counseling to stop beating
[54:25] their wife or sometimes it's white
[54:27] beating their husbands you know and so
[54:30] so that that realm of affections we've
[54:33] got to get victory over there the Bible
[54:36] said set your affections on things above
[54:39] that's the only way it's a paradigm
[54:42] shift here's the world here is lost here
[54:45] is the devil here you're serving sin
[54:48] over here you're clean you're pure your
[54:50] spotless your holy with a personal
[54:52] intimate covenant relationship with the
[54:55] King of Kings Lord of lords and you know
[54:57] what he is said about you you know your
[55:00] position and cry you got victory over
[55:02] the enemy you know think about all these
[55:06] sensations now just to kind of wrap this
[55:09] up eyes ears taste touch smell conscious
[55:12] memory imagination reasons and
[55:13] affections the world that we live in now
[55:17] there are they used to be if somebody
[55:20] was a star that was somebody maybe back
[55:23] in the 50s in the 60s
[55:25] then they said he's a superstar and
[55:27] maybe the 80s maybe the 90 you know some
[55:29] of the rock and roll guys some of the
[55:31] Hollywood you know a queens in Hollywood
[55:34] but now they've got to be a megastar to
[55:37] get anybody's attention and they're out
[55:39] there friends every day around this
[55:41] country there are hundreds of rock and
[55:44] roll concerts and lap concerts where
[55:46] young minds young teenage minds are
[55:49] going there and they're watching these
[55:51] demons perform now you look at that
[55:54] person and it looks like a sweet young
[55:56] girl 13 years old you have no idea how
[55:59] her mind is being wired they have no
[56:02] idea how that young man's mind is being
[56:05] wired for the future they are creating
[56:07] monsters every day if mothers knew what
[56:11] was going on if mothers knew what was
[56:13] going on in the child's bedroom with
[56:16] that cellphone they would snatch that
[56:18] thing out of there and they would
[56:19] handcuff them to the bed and make them
[56:21] go to sleep didn't matter how much they
[56:23] cry didn't matter nothing I love my
[56:25] daughter I'm not gonna turn her over to
[56:27] the devil that one brother in our church
[56:30] says I refuse to be a lamb chop for the
[56:33] devil I like that that's how most people
[56:36] are they're just lamb chops for all the
[56:38] demons the demons had to eat him up now
[56:42] so that's music stars and you've got the
[56:45] TV stars and the Hollywood quit brother
[56:47] Branson it started way back in the 1890s
[56:50] back in Paris and in Paris they sent all
[56:53] their fashions over here you know what
[56:56] until the turn of the century there was
[56:58] no such thing as a moving picture some
[57:01] of you young people may not realize
[57:02] there was no television
[57:04] there was no movie there was none of
[57:06] that things over there but Satan and at
[57:09] first Satan came up it was Charlie
[57:11] Chaplin and it was the talking just just
[57:14] people moving around no sound and people
[57:16] were dazzled by that the talkies you
[57:20] know and no talk just it's action that's
[57:23] how most people are you know I call it
[57:26] NATO na tio no action talk only
[57:32] and see so then Satan came along and he
[57:36] had motion picture and then he had
[57:38] people talking while they were acting
[57:40] brother Prince they're actors they act
[57:43] out apart and many of these actors they
[57:46] have played so many parts and they have
[57:48] engrossed themselves in so many parts
[57:51] they do not even know who they really
[57:53] are I see some of these guys you know
[57:57] one guy he's a big tough guy Holly he
[58:00] played all the tough-guy roles in the
[58:01] acting movies when I used to watch way
[58:04] back before I became a Christian he said
[58:06] I'd like to take that president I'd like
[58:08] to pop them you know and use some
[58:10] horrible language you know he thinks
[58:11] he's a tough guy because he's act out so
[58:14] many tough guy he's taken on that
[58:15] persona everybody expects that of him
[58:18] he's probably a wimp we know one thing
[58:21] he's a supernatural wimp if a person
[58:24] doesn't have it doesn't have this
[58:25] message they are a zero pound weakling
[58:28] these talk about the 90-pound weakling
[58:31] these are zero pound weaklings so now
[58:35] you have the movies and the TVs and then
[58:40] the sports stars
[58:41] oh my nowadays the baseball the football
[58:45] stars and I mean it's just incredible
[58:48] the money they're being paid and how
[58:50] everything in Satan's realm it's
[58:53] beginning to merge it's B it's the it's
[58:56] the actors and they get involved in
[58:58] politics and the sports people they get
[59:01] involved in entertainment and then they
[59:03] get involved in politics and it's all
[59:05] Satan it's a it's a homogeneous a
[59:08] homogeneous pancake that he's making up
[59:10] there and people are influenced by what
[59:13] the celebrities say let me say something
[59:16] especially to the young people if you
[59:19] can get this the so the so-called
[59:22] celebrities of this world whether
[59:24] they're TV movie sports business
[59:27] whatever kind of a realm they're in they
[59:31] should have zero percent influence on
[59:34] you doesn't matter how beautiful they
[59:38] are doesn't matter how good they talk or
[59:40] how good know how smart they are I see
[59:42] some of these commentators and they
[59:44] think Oh
[59:45] wisdom started and ended with me
[59:49] the final voice and they said so
[59:53] cocksure and they're not even in
[59:56] pre-kindergarten not even in pre nursery
[59:59] schools many of them Catholics bowing
[1:00:03] yes how does it just boggles my it
[1:00:06] boggles my mind how I could have been so
[1:00:08] stupid to believe all that Catholic
[1:00:10] doctrine but now you know I was telling
[1:00:13] brother Sam your former representative

[1:05:45] foot tall and he takes a little orange
[1:05:47] ball and he jumps up and stuffs it in
[1:05:49] the basket and he goes and he comes
[1:05:51] running down he and he's like this and I
[1:05:55] took the picture I saw the picture of it
[1:05:58] he would have made a better King Kong
[1:06:01] than King Kong would have made scary
[1:06:04] literal scary but he's the king nobody
[1:06:09] like nobody's ever been like him you
[1:06:12] know what the king he just left
[1:06:14] Cleveland nowhere he moved to LA he got
[1:06:19] a twenty five million dollar mansion and
[1:06:22] he's building another twenty five
[1:06:23] million dollar mansion and he
[1:06:25] got a long term contract brother sam and
[1:06:28] i believe he's the king is going to be
[1:06:30] there when la just slides right off into
[1:06:33] the ocean that's gonna be the last we
[1:06:35] hear of the king
[1:06:36] thank God we won't be around to see that
[1:06:39] one so now we go out of the realm of the
[1:06:42] physical and the emotional the spiritual
[1:06:45] and we go into the realm of the soul the
[1:06:50] realm of the soul that's a that's either
[1:06:52] God or the serpent
[1:06:54] there's note that there's no happy
[1:06:56] median in there a person is either
[1:06:59] anointed and led and guided and directed
[1:07:02] and motivated and inspired by one or the
[1:07:05] other that's the Holy of Holies
[1:07:08] a sacred place a holy place it's not a
[1:07:12] place for your tiptoe out and your
[1:07:14] tiptoe back in you live there
[1:07:16] permanently full-time God's not looking
[1:07:20] for any part-time Christians he's
[1:07:24] looking for full-time soldiers and
[1:07:26] warriors and I'll tell you friends just
[1:07:28] closing now when when when he lives in
[1:07:31] that realm but the random calls it the
[1:07:34] control tower and when that when God is
[1:07:37] in your control tower your ship is safe
[1:07:40] the navigate it's a supernatural
[1:07:43] navigation system and it is set for you
[1:07:47] unto eternity it's set for you for the
[1:07:50] wedding supper it's set for you for the
[1:07:52] Millennium it's set for you for eternity
[1:07:55] and it's a holy place a sacred place the
[1:07:59] outer court the lorentz that was okay
[1:08:01] the inner court that was a little bit
[1:08:03] better but the the the the Holy of
[1:08:06] Holies and he says did you ever meet
[1:08:09] somebody who's been there they live
[1:08:12] there they come out always sweet always
[1:08:16] kind always nice never have anything bad
[1:08:21] to say about anybody because they been
[1:08:24] with him and and their habit is holiness
[1:08:29] their habit is love brother Branham said
[1:08:34] that without perfect love no rapture
[1:08:39] sometimes I think people have skipped
[1:08:41] over that they use the Bible and the
[1:08:44] message they use it like a menu it's
[1:08:47] like going to a smorgasbord well I like
[1:08:49] the chicken I don't like fish tomorrow
[1:08:51] I'm gonna get you can't use the Bible
[1:08:54] you can't use the message like a menu
[1:08:57] friend you've got to take the whole
[1:08:59] thing lock stock and barrel and you have
[1:09:02] to take the barrel to let's stand to our
[1:09:04] feet friends in first Peter Peter said
[1:09:10] beloved think it not strange concerning
[1:09:12] the fiery trial which is to try you as
[1:09:16] though some strange thing happen to you
[1:09:19] no this is not the exception that you're
[1:09:22] targeted that's don't think it's well
[1:09:25] why me how come you know I read the
[1:09:29] Bible I know every one of us how would
[1:09:33] you like to have gone through what Paul
[1:09:35] went through whip five times with 39
[1:09:39] lash I don't believe there's too many
[1:09:41] men alive today that could survive one
[1:09:44] of those kind of beatings with 30 he got
[1:09:47] it five times three times they beat him
[1:09:49] with rods shipwrecked they hated him
[1:09:53] they hate imprisoned for most of of his
[1:09:57] ministry in jail I had to write with big
[1:10:01] big letters and knowing knowing that all
[1:10:04] the churches that he had planted out
[1:10:06] there that the wolves were going in to
[1:10:09] try to grab the sheep you know who most
[1:10:11] of them were they called them the
[1:10:13] Judaizers the ones that went there and
[1:10:16] they went into these newborn Holy Ghost
[1:10:18] filled Christian Church and they tried
[1:10:21] to say well that's okay but you have to
[1:10:23] keep the law yeah Moses said the loss
[1:10:26] and they tried to make these newborn
[1:10:28] Christians some of them that were
[1:10:30] heathen didn't know anything about
[1:10:31] anything except Christ they tried to go
[1:10:33] back and make them become Jews now Paul
[1:10:37] what what a burden he went through and
[1:10:40] then I think about what our prophet went
[1:10:42] through my you know the most transparent
[1:10:46] prophet in all of history you know when
[1:10:50] you go back and you
[1:10:50] read Isaiah Jeremiah Ezrin any of the
[1:10:53] prophets we read and maybe it's you know
[1:10:56] Isaiah is 66 chapters you know what
[1:10:58] that's like a a minut cliff notes into
[1:11:02] what isaiah did we don't hear about what
[1:11:05] how many children he had we don't hear
[1:11:07] about is why we don't hear about the
[1:11:08] strife and the family we don't hear
[1:11:10] about money Pro we don't hear none of
[1:11:12] the whole I say yeah and we have I say
[1:11:14] up on this great big pedestal let me ask
[1:11:18] you a question if Jesus was alive today
[1:11:21] right now what do you think social media
[1:11:26] would have to say about Jesus Christ
[1:11:28] today right now talk about being
[1:11:34] barbecued they would crucify him so you
[1:11:38] can I mean they're taking Jesus Christ
[1:11:40] out of every have taken the commandments
[1:11:42] we got a guy high school football coach
[1:11:44] in Washington he just wanted to have
[1:11:46] prayer with his football players before
[1:11:48] they went onto the football field
[1:11:50] fired that guy done toast gone you know
[1:11:57] sometimes people say well you know if
[1:11:59] you don't want to know something go to
[1:12:01] Google Google knows everything
[1:12:02] ask Google who Jesus is Google don't
[1:12:06] know when you're living in that sacred
[1:12:11] place think it not strange consign
[1:12:14] concerning the fiery trial which is a
[1:12:16] try you as though some strange thing
[1:12:18] happened unto you but rejoice and as
[1:12:21] much as year partakers of Christ's
[1:12:23] suffering that when his glory shall be
[1:12:25] revealed you may be glad with exceeding
[1:12:28] joy in 1st Peter 5 it says be sober be
[1:12:32] vigilant that means be aware be alert
[1:12:39] attention because your adversary the
[1:12:43] devil as a roaring lion glad he said as
[1:12:46] a roaring lion
[1:12:49] he's like snagglepuss to lion he roars
[1:12:52] but he's got no teeth some of you young
[1:12:55] people might have to look up snagglepuss
[1:12:57] and find out who he was walketh about
[1:12:59] seeking whom he may devour resist
[1:13:01] steadfast in the faith knowing that the
[1:13:03] same
[1:13:04] fliction czar accomplished in your
[1:13:06] brethren that are in the world but the
[1:13:08] God of all Grace who hath called you
[1:13:10] unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus

[1:14:29] to look at the world not to look at at
[1:14:31] the entertainment not to look at the

[1:14:35] romance books or any other of Satan's
[1:14:39] delicacies that he dangles before the
[1:14:42] world and intoxicates them and then as a
[1:14:44] vulture he feeds on his own children as
[1:14:48] he did with Elvis Presley as he did with
[1:14:50] Michael Jackson and all the rest of them
[1:14:52] that we could mention father he lifts
[1:14:55] them up he allows them to be glorified
