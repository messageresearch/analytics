[33:59] comfortable a little bit more at home
[34:00] so you know just gonna let my hair down
[34:04] what's left of it and and we'll just
[34:06] have a good time amen
[34:08] but uh once again just appreciate
[34:10] brother samuel having us in
[34:12] and uh you know to stand in the pulpit
[34:15] of someone who's
[34:16] who's pastored for 50 years and has
[34:19] stayed true to this message and preached
[34:21] this gospel
[34:22] with all of his heart it's a very i told
[34:24] brother brother samuel it's a very
[34:25] intimidating place to be
[34:27] uh you know i've only been pastor for
[34:29] about six years i'm still just a kid
[34:31] and uh to step in the in the in the
[34:33] footprints of these
[34:35] men who have uh uh they've
[34:39] made the path clear uh they've they were
[34:42] the
[34:42] the path breakers they're kind of like a
[34:45] john the baptist ministry of bringing
[34:47] those low places
[34:49] high and bringing the high places low
[34:51] and straightening out the crooked to
[34:52] make
[34:53] my job easier and and if the lord should
[34:56] tear these young people who are coming
[34:57] along behind us it'll make it the path
[34:59] easier
[35:00] even for them and that's that's the
[35:02] mission that's what we're working
[35:04] towards
[35:05] uh to make that path easier and so uh
[35:08] if you would we're just gonna jump back
[35:10] into the word uh this morning we're
[35:12] gonna
[35:12] start in uh second corinthians chapter
[35:14] five we're just going to continue on
[35:16] kind of where we were this morning but
[35:18] in a different direction
[35:20] uh but talking some more about ministry
[35:22] and this morning we spoke about how the
[35:24] mechanism or
[35:25] process of ministry functions how god
[35:27] prepares an individual for your
[35:30] individual ministry or pulpit ministry
[35:31] whatever it may be and how that
[35:33] that works god trains you uh through
[35:35] hardship and the afflictions that the
[35:37] devil brings upon you and uses those
[35:39] experiences
[35:40] to then allow you to speak or testify
[35:43] and and
[35:44] through that process we're able to
[35:45] minister to others
[35:47] and so now we're going to talk a little
[35:49] bit about the purpose or the mission
[35:51] of that ministry so uh and and i know
[35:54] brother
[35:55] uh i told you to start at verse five but
[35:56] we're going to start at verse one
[35:58] and we're going to get get a little bit
[36:00] of context here for we know that if our
[36:02] earthly house of all this tabernacle
[36:04] were dissolved
[36:05] we have a building of god a house not
[36:08] made with hands
[36:09] eternal in the heavens we spoke this
[36:12] morning about there being an eternal
[36:14] reward not to get stuck on the
[36:16] uh temporal but to look towards the
[36:18] eternal
[36:19] and paul's letting us know we've got a
[36:21] home waiting for us
[36:23] for in this we groan earnestly desiring
[36:26] to be clothed upon
[36:27] with our house which is from heaven if
[36:30] so be that being clothed we shall not be
[36:32] found naked for we that are in this
[36:34] tabernacle do groan being burdened
[36:37] not for that we would be unclothed but
[36:39] clothe the pond
[36:40] that mortality might be swallowed up of
[36:43] life
[36:44] now he that wrought us for the selfsame
[36:47] thing is god
[36:48] who also hath given us this earnest of
[36:51] the spirit therefore
[36:52] we are always confident knowing that
[36:55] whilst we are at home
[36:56] in the body we are absent from the lord
[36:59] for we
[36:59] walk by faith and not by sight can you
[37:02] see a theme
[37:03] here we will look into the invisible
[37:08] we are confident i say and willing
[37:10] rather to be absent from the body
[37:12] and to be present with the lord
[37:13] wherefore we labor that whether we
[37:15] be present or absent we may be accepted
[37:18] of him for we must all appear
[37:20] before the judgment seat of christ that
[37:21] everyone may receive the things done in
[37:23] this body
[37:24] according to that he hath done whether
[37:26] it be good or bad
[37:28] knowing therefore the terror of the lord
[37:30] we persuade
[37:31] men but we are made manifest unto god
[37:34] and i trust also
[37:35] are made manifest in your consciences
[37:37] and we'll stop right there for now and
[37:39] bow our heads
[37:40] father we thank you once again for your
[37:42] goodness and mercy and lord as we sang
[37:44] the song tonight we want to see you
[37:45] tonight
[37:46] and we're lord the way we are able to
[37:48] see you is not through
[37:51] as the world would turn to spirituality
[37:53] and these things but we see you
[37:55] in your word and so father we look to
[37:57] your word and we ask that you would open
[37:59] it to us and that god
[38:00] we might see you clearly tonight we
[38:02] might see the mission that you've given
[38:04] us and
[38:05] the ministry that you've given each one
[38:07] of us and god that we might excel in
[38:09] that and have great success
[38:10] and god i pray for each one here under
[38:12] the sound of my voice that lord if
[38:14] there's some that are struggling tonight
[38:16] god you would touch them and you'd give
[38:17] them the strength that they need if
[38:19] they're those who are weak in body and
[38:20] need a healing touch may you touch them
[38:22] right now
[38:23] if there are those who have questions if
[38:24] those who are are hounded by worry and
[38:27] doubt i pray god that you would give
[38:28] them confidence and you would give them
[38:30] a sure word tonight lord
[38:32] not through me as a man for my
[38:34] sufficiency is
[38:35] so inadequate as a human being god i
[38:38] cannot help anyone i can't even help
[38:39] myself
[38:40] but our sufficiency tonight is of christ
[38:43] so we asked father that you would just
[38:44] speak to each one of us and that god you
[38:46] would open your word
[38:47] bless us lord in jesus name we pray amen
[38:51] amen you may have your seats we're going
[38:54] to continue on
[38:55] reading the chapter here and then and
[38:57] we'll go back and get into to some
[38:59] things here
[39:00] but he says for we commend verse 12 not
[39:02] ourselves again unto you
[39:04] but give you occasion to glory on our
[39:06] behalf that we may have somewhat to
[39:08] answer them which glory and appearance
[39:10] and not in heart for whether we be
[39:12] beside ourselves
[39:13] it is to god and whether we be sober it
[39:16] is for your cause and we talked this
[39:17] morning about
[39:18] uh being a nut for god being a little
[39:21] bit crazy and paul says look if we get a
[39:23] little bit crazy brother graham says
[39:24] look if if i get a little beside myself
[39:26] if i get a little bit happy if i seem a
[39:28] little bit crazy just leave me alone
[39:30] i'm happy the way i am and and david
[39:33] experienced that same thing he got to a
[39:35] place to where he was so
[39:36] lost in god he said you know this crown
[39:40] i don't need this crown i just take this
[39:41] crown off these royal robes they don't
[39:43] mean nothing
[39:44] because the ark of the covenant god is
[39:46] here in my city god is coming into my
[39:48] home and he got so excited his royal
[39:50] trappings
[39:51] he just had to tear him off he was
[39:52] having such a good time he was beside
[39:54] himself
[39:55] he got completely lost and it was under
[39:56] god it wasn't a show off to anybody else
[39:59] so much so his own wife got embarrassed
[40:01] over the whole deal
[40:02] got a little bit of david what are you
[40:04] doing oh my goodness
[40:05] what are you doing he said look this
[40:07] isn't a show for you this isn't a show
[40:09] for the public this is for god amen
[40:11] and so paul says if we get beside
[40:13] ourselves it's unto god but
[40:15] but if we have some moments as ministers
[40:18] and
[40:18] and in your ministry when you get them
[40:20] all a few lucid moments
[40:22] you get a few moments where you can put
[40:23] a thought together it's for your sakes
[40:25] it's when we come together and we read
[40:27] this word and god
[40:29] gives us understanding it's for your
[40:30] sakes
[40:32] and so he says for whether we be beside
[40:34] ourselves as to god whether we be
[40:35] sober it's for your cause for the love
[40:38] of christ constraineth us
[40:40] there's a constraint i talked about that
[40:41] fire inside this morning
[40:43] it is to god uh because we thus judge if
[40:47] the one died for all then all were dead
[40:49] and that he died for all that they which
[40:51] lived should not henceforth
[40:53] live unto themselves but unto him which
[40:56] died for them and rose again you are not
[40:59] your own
[41:00] you have been bought with a price
[41:03] wherefore henceforth we know no man
[41:05] after the flesh yea though we have known
[41:06] christ after the flesh yet now
[41:08] henceforth
[41:09] know we him no more now don't think that
[41:12] we don't know christ anymore but what
[41:14] he's saying is we
[41:14] do not there's lots of people who
[41:16] understand christ
[41:18] as a historical figure of 2000 years ago
[41:21] every christmas people go to little
[41:23] manger scenes and they they worship the
[41:25] god
[41:25] of 2000 years ago the christ of 2000
[41:28] years ago they see him in his flesh and
[41:30] some say he was a great philosopher and
[41:31] some say he was a great teacher and he
[41:33] was a good man
[41:34] and he was this that or the other but i
[41:35] tell you he was not
[41:37] just a good man he was the son of god
[41:41] and knowing him in the flesh would not
[41:44] help you at all how many people
[41:47] broke bread with him sat at a table with
[41:49] him who shook
[41:50] hands with him who heard him speak how
[41:53] many of that five
[41:54] thousand that day of men who ate that
[41:56] bread and loaves
[41:57] of fishes how many of those were there
[42:00] in the upper room how many of those were
[42:02] there along the path how many were there
[42:04] just knowing him after the flesh is not
[42:06] good enough
[42:07] you've got to have something more than
[42:09] that and so he says this
[42:11] that henceforth we know him therefore if
[42:15] any
[42:16] man be in christ he is a new creature
[42:18] and old things are passed away
[42:20] behold all things are become new he's
[42:23] talking about a new birth he's talking
[42:24] about a new creation he's talking about
[42:26] a new work
[42:27] and all things are of god who hath
[42:29] reconciled us
[42:30] to himself by jesus christ and hath
[42:33] given to
[42:33] us the ministry of reconciliation
[42:37] and that's what i want to talk about
[42:39] this is the mission
[42:41] this is the the what we are called to
[42:44] this is
[42:44] the purpose of ministry is to continue
[42:47] the ministry of jesus christ
[42:49] which is one of reconciliation
[42:52] and so we see then that we're we're to
[42:54] whit god was in christ
[42:56] reconciling the world unto himself not
[42:59] imputing
[43:00] their trespasses unto them who hath
[43:02] committed unto us
[43:03] the word of reconciliation amen
[43:07] now then and i can slow down right now i
[43:10] don't have a two o'clock time
[43:12] time limit so i'll try not to preach
[43:14] quite so fast
[43:17] but i'm excited amen now then we are
[43:20] ambassadors for christ
[43:22] as though god did beseech you
[43:26] by us we're ambassadors
[43:30] not just the men standing in the pulpit
[43:32] you're an ambassador
[43:34] as though god would use your voice
[43:38] to speak to a lost
[43:41] and alienated world and this is what
[43:44] he's saying
[43:45] as though god beseech you by us we pray
[43:48] you in christ's stead
[43:50] be ye reconciled
[43:53] to god amen this is the mission
[43:57] this is the gospel to be reconciled back
[44:00] to god
[44:01] and we see that at the beginning we we
[44:04] talked
[44:04] i think yesterday i got to find some way
[44:07] to tie all these together so
[44:09] uh it got to be some continuity but we
[44:11] see in creation in genesis one in the
[44:13] beginning god created the heavens and
[44:14] the earth
[44:15] and the world was without form and void
[44:16] and there was a there was chaos and i
[44:18] want you to
[44:19] to remember that there was a chaos there
[44:21] was there was nothing overseeing it was
[44:23] spinning kind of out of control but god
[44:25] moved upon the face of the waters
[44:27] he brooded over it brother branham said
[44:30] he made love to the world and
[44:31] and through that process out of chaos he
[44:34] began to he could began to create
[44:36] order he began to move upon it and and
[44:39] we see in the garden that when god
[44:41] placed adam and eve there there was
[44:43] there was a perfect unity between god
[44:44] and man
[44:46] because when we're talking about
[44:47] reconciliation in order for there to be
[44:49] reconciliation first there has to be
[44:51] alienation
[44:53] there has to be a separation there has
[44:54] to be a loss of fellowship
[44:57] this is what god is desiring fellowship
[44:59] remember when he created the heavens and
[45:00] the earth and he placed adam and eve
[45:02] there it was so that he could have
[45:03] fellowship with himself
[45:06] we are him she is him and so adam and
[45:10] eve when he placed them there he's
[45:11] coming down in the cool the evening to
[45:13] have fellowship with them
[45:14] and and that unity that was formed there
[45:17] that was god's desire that was
[45:19] what he had created all this for and and
[45:21] that unity was there and everything was
[45:23] in perfect harmony and
[45:24] and there were no thorns and there were
[45:26] no thistles there were no weeds in the
[45:27] garden
[45:28] there was no difficulties that we have
[45:30] to deal with today
[45:31] none of those things they didn't have to
[45:33] own a manure spreader they didn't have
[45:35] to have a
[45:36] a weed eater they didn't have to have
[45:38] any of those things
[45:40] everything was in perfect order and as
[45:42] even though adam tended the garden it
[45:46] was
[45:46] it was more of kind of redecorating the
[45:48] house
[45:50] you know i think adam and eve together
[45:52] he would say you know i think
[45:54] i think a row of apple trees across
[45:55] there would look really good and adam
[45:57] says well
[45:57] i think peach trees would look a little
[45:59] better you know and and i don't think
[46:00] they got into much fuss about it and
[46:01] they said well maybe we'll just
[46:02] alternate a peach and apple peach and
[46:04] apple pizza now
[46:06] and it was so they had dominion they had
[46:09] control
[46:09] and let's move this tree over here and
[46:11] that tree just moved over there
[46:13] and oh let's create a mountain vista
[46:14] over here and oh that's just beautiful
[46:16] what do you think god will think about i
[46:17] think he'll be he'll really like it and
[46:19] when he comes down in the evening we'll
[46:20] talk about it together
[46:22] there was a unity there there was a
[46:24] unity between adam and eve and between
[46:27] the two of them and
[46:28] god and that unity i tell you the devil
[46:31] doesn't like it
[46:32] he don't care for it and he says brother
[46:34] branson says you'll notice how the adam
[46:36] or the eve was united with adam she
[46:39] become a part of him
[46:41] god did you notice in genesis 1 27 he
[46:43] created man
[46:44] male and female created he them now the
[46:47] man was both male and female when it
[46:49] came to the
[46:50] being and the spirit of feminist and
[46:52] masculine
[46:53] then god took from his side a rib did
[46:56] you notice the body part was a
[46:59] byproduct but not the spirit
[47:02] the body part of the woman was a
[47:04] byproduct after the creation had been
[47:07] finished god took from the side of adam
[47:09] a rib and made a woman
[47:11] but not the spirit the spirit was part
[47:13] of adam for he was both man
[47:15] and woman feminist speaking naturally
[47:18] spiritually speaking both masculine and
[47:20] feminist now
[47:21] don't you see the great picture we're in
[47:23] the flesh we and the flesh are different
[47:26] we're we're like a byproduct so sisters
[47:29] if you get upset about the
[47:30] the term byproduct you're a byproduct we
[47:32] all a byproduct
[47:34] right yeah okay we're like a byproduct a
[47:37] created
[47:38] being by holy wedlock but in spirit we
[47:41] are sons and daughters
[47:42] not some other spirit but the spirit of
[47:45] the living god
[47:47] we are in his likeness in his unity
[47:50] in the perfect image of the living god
[47:52] because we become sons and daughters
[47:54] not separated but the same spirit the
[47:56] same god
[47:57] the same spirit joined in wedlock to the
[48:00] eternal
[48:01] see how god planned it that we should
[48:03] not be a different but him
[48:06] we're not different but we're him he
[48:08] came down in the garden to have
[48:09] fellowship with himself
[48:12] all right separate uh
[48:16] i got a bigger print now
[48:21] not some other being of some other tribe
[48:23] but a real
[48:24] union and offspring of the almighty done
[48:27] by a holy union now the body comes from
[48:29] mother and father but the spirit comes
[48:31] from god
[48:32] god separating himself as adam was
[48:33] separated on the day of pentecost we
[48:35] find the holy spirit the pillar of fire
[48:37] separating itself
[48:38] and setting upon each member of that
[48:40] church god putting himself
[48:42] together then with that group of people
[48:45] together what does it do it brings back
[48:46] the unified body of the lord jesus
[48:49] coming together and in this great day of
[48:52] great
[48:53] separation that we're living in great
[48:56] separation that we're living in
[48:57] you know the civil rights movement all
[48:59] that stuff we were supposed to be united
[49:01] together
[49:02] but we're as a country more divided than
[49:04] we've ever been
[49:06] there's the media everything is seeking
[49:08] to divide us
[49:10] but god seeks that we be united a united
[49:13] body and
[49:14] united in purpose the bride of jesus
[49:17] christ is not going to have any schism
[49:18] not going to have any division
[49:20] she's going to be united amen
[49:23] he says he says what a pity what a
[49:25] disgrace but we're joined in heavenly
[49:27] wedlock to the eternal guard part of him
[49:29] part of god
[49:30] and flesh i become branham because of my
[49:32] father branham and you become part of
[49:33] your father and mother but in spirit we
[49:35] become in union with god
[49:37] part of god that's the reason that the
[49:39] spirit cannot die
[49:40] he that believeth on me has everlasting
[49:42] life and in the image
[49:44] that he is here on earth and in his
[49:46] likeness i'll raise him up on the last
[49:48] day
[49:49] not a spirit being for we'll have a body
[49:51] like god's glorious body
[49:52] the glorified body of jesus raised up in
[49:54] that image jesus said
[49:56] going to the great grave of lazarus i am
[49:58] the resurrection in life he that
[50:00] believeth on me
[50:00] though he be dead yet shall he live and
[50:02] whosoever liveth and believeth in me
[50:05] shall never die
[50:06] believeth in me not on me but in me
[50:09] being in him believing and if you abide
[50:11] in
[50:12] me and my words abide in you in him
[50:15] believing oh my i hope the holy spirit
[50:17] gets that right down to you
[50:19] we've got to be in him united with him
[50:22] and this is the ministry of
[50:24] reconciliation is to get us
[50:26] back in unity get us back and fellowship
[50:29] get us back to what we lost in the
[50:31] garden and this is what satan hates and
[50:33] this is what he's fighting so hard
[50:35] against
[50:36] and this ministry of reconciliation is
[50:38] is what we're moving through and what
[50:40] what what uh we're called to be a part
[50:42] of
[50:43] amen
[50:47] we're to continue that it was in christ
[50:49] reconciling
[50:51] to himself the world and he's given us
[50:54] amen the ministry of reconciliation
[50:58] right
[51:01] now brother graham says this and god's
[51:03] provided away
[51:05] he says that great evangelist he had a
[51:07] good thing but i think he approached it
[51:10] wrong and he's talking about billy
[51:11] graham and you know i'll just say this
[51:13] that you know the angels have left saw
[51:16] them
[51:18] right
[51:21] he said that billy graham and oral
[51:22] roberts were the two angels sent down
[51:25] and they're off the scene now judgment's
[51:29] coming
[51:31] amen so don't knock billy graham don't
[51:34] knock oral robbers they had their
[51:35] calling they fulfilled it we have our
[51:38] calling
[51:38] let's fulfill it
[51:44] but he said he approached it wrong he
[51:45] said the thing of it is you lazy
[51:47] preacher sit with your feet on the desk
[51:48] and don't go out and talk to the people
[51:50] so that's where it's laid and and he
[51:53] said that
[51:53] in the context there if he said i go
[51:55] into a city and i get 30 000 converts
[51:57] and come back a year later and can't
[51:58] hardly find five
[51:59] right and this is what he thought the
[52:01] problem was it was the preachers
[52:03] but brother and says this but billy what
[52:04] preacher laid his feet on the desk that
[52:06] that one
[52:06] that had one of paul's conversion it was
[52:09] because that today we just stop at the
[52:11] waters of separation
[52:13] and don't take them into fellowship with
[52:16] the holy ghost
[52:17] and the power of the shekinah glory you
[52:19] get a man in that condition and he'll
[52:21] burn a city down with the gospel
[52:23] nothing can stop him he's got the spirit
[52:24] of god upon him he don't need nobody to
[52:26] coax him god's right in him just
[52:28] burning up the sin as he goes he can't
[52:31] stand still why
[52:32] he's entered into the fellowship by
[52:34] relationship
[52:35] relationship he's born again he's a new
[52:37] creature in christ
[52:38] he come through the waters of separation
[52:40] don't stop there friends
[52:42] don't stop there he walked through the
[52:44] blood of sanctification
[52:45] don't stop there friends he went into
[52:47] the fellowship of the
[52:48] of the holy ghost yes sir he's born into
[52:51] the fellowship
[52:53] god's only provided approach
[52:55] [Music]
[52:56] there's no other way there's no other
[52:58] approach nowhere no
[53:00] time or any way only through that and as
[53:02] i said our denominations i appreciate
[53:04] them
[53:04] and and i'll say this let's not
[53:07] let this denominate let this
[53:09] denominational spirit
[53:11] come into the message
[53:14] and i know it's there it's been working
[53:16] for years but
[53:17] just putting message on the door is not
[53:20] any safety net to you
[53:22] it will not save you it will not keep
[53:24] you yes i believe it's the best place in
[53:27] the world for that
[53:28] relationship to be to be uh initiated
[53:31] and grow and and what it needs to be
[53:33] between us and god
[53:34] but you can't just come to a message a
[53:37] church
[53:38] and think that's good enough you can't
[53:41] just say
[53:42] i believe god sent a prophet and think
[53:44] that's good enough
[53:45] there's got to be more than that you've
[53:47] got to come into that shekinah glory for
[53:49] yourself
[53:50] you've got to come into relationship
[53:52] with god for yourself
[53:54] doesn't matter what mom and dad did it
[53:55] doesn't matter what grandpa and grandma
[53:57] did
[53:57] my grandpa was in brother branham's
[53:58] meetings he got prayed for he got healed
[54:00] but that won't help me a bit
[54:01] all right i've got to know him for
[54:03] myself
[54:06] our creeds that's perfectly all right
[54:08] that serves the purpose of a brother
[54:09] they'll never take the place of the
[54:11] blood of jesus christ
[54:12] they can't because that's god's only
[54:14] basis we should be zealous of our
[54:16] denomination we should be zealous of the
[54:18] message and
[54:18] i'm not equating it with a denomination
[54:20] but i'm going to tell you this
[54:22] be very careful because it can become a
[54:24] denomination
[54:27] oh yeah if we think well we're in the
[54:28] message there's not much difference but
[54:30] saying well we're
[54:31] we're a methodist or a good baptist
[54:34] if you're using that as the um your
[54:36] safety umbrella all right
[54:39] you got to know him for yourself
[54:43] two million people followed the
[54:46] messenger of moses
[54:48] they ate the same manna they heard the
[54:51] same
[54:52] message they believed it but they did
[54:55] not mix it with
[54:56] faith the bible tells us and because
[54:58] they didn't do that
[55:00] it profited them not one bit
[55:03] right amen they walked through the red
[55:06] sea
[55:07] they drank the water out of the rock and
[55:10] they died
[55:11] in their sins
[55:14] oh god help us
[55:19] and and i'll tell you this i appreciate
[55:21] that was a fine job brother it was a
[55:22] good good
[55:23] sermon that was a wonderful sermon that
[55:24] was that was wonderful i'm a human being
[55:26] and and i appreciate that somebody
[55:28] brother branham had preached a sermon
[55:30] and afterwards somebody came to him
[55:32] so brother branham i appreciate that was
[55:33] really good somebody just got offended
[55:35] on that
[55:37] and they said i said you shouldn't you
[55:38] shouldn't do that taking god's glory and
[55:39] brother braham goes no no no
[55:41] he says i'm i'm a human being and i like
[55:44] it
[55:44] he said the only difference between you
[55:46] and me is i'm honest
[55:48] [Music]
[55:52] but understand this just coming to
[55:54] church and hearing a good sermon
[55:56] being entertained or getting a good
[55:59] feeling
[56:00] i tell you what as a minister i i don't
[56:02] really care about that
[56:05] i know brother wade doesn't our brother
[56:07] here doesn't no no none of us
[56:08] none of us ministers care about that
[56:10] what we care is that god touch you
[56:12] that god change you that your
[56:14] relationship with him was
[56:16] furthered that you got closer to him
[56:18] that he did something eternal on the
[56:20] inside
[56:22] this isn't about entertainment this
[56:24] isn't about making you feel good as you
[56:26] drift off away from him yeah come on
[56:29] come on
[56:30] you want that there's plenty of churches
[56:32] you can turn on the tv
[56:34] and join thousands watching services
[56:36] that'll make you feel good as you drift
[56:38] away from him
[56:40] but this ministry this ministry we've
[56:43] been given is a one of restoration one
[56:45] of
[56:45] reconciliation to bring us into
[56:48] communion with god
[56:50] bring us into a relationship with god to
[56:52] restore
[56:53] what was lost in the garden that god and
[56:56] man could come down in the cool of the
[56:57] evening and
[56:58] walk together
[57:01] this is the purpose
[57:05] we should be zealous of our
[57:06] denominations trying to make it grow
[57:08] that's fine that's good i appreciate
[57:09] that but i'll never
[57:10] take the place of the blood no sir
[57:14] so we see that god god is in the
[57:17] reconciliation business he's in the
[57:18] restoration business he's restored
[57:22] he's in a he's that's his job that's
[57:24] what he's into
[57:25] and so and and it's our job to tell the
[57:28] truth
[57:29] and i know i'm skipping around brother
[57:30] you just this is the way i do it so
[57:35] and convinced then concerned 1962 he
[57:37] says it's our duty it's our duty to
[57:39] people to
[57:40] to really tell the truth right amen
[57:43] because you're going to meet it again
[57:46] we said we're going to stand in judgment
[57:47] one day on what we brought
[57:49] and in the first book of corinthians it
[57:51] says look there's no other foundation in
[57:53] christ but we can build upon it we can
[57:54] build with sticks we can build a stubble
[57:56] we can build with
[57:57] with stone we can build with gold we can
[57:58] build with precious gems
[58:00] the ministry gives you the tools it's
[58:03] our job
[58:03] as ministers to give you the tools to
[58:06] build
[58:06] and we're like an 84 lumber yeah
[58:11] we're to take this world word break it
[58:14] down
[58:15] and give you the resources you need to
[58:17] build a life
[58:19] a life not on sam's not on the sands of
[58:22] this
[58:23] world but on the solid rock and
[58:26] foundation of jesus christ
[58:28] but it's your responsibility what you're
[58:30] going to build on it what you do with it
[58:32] and it will be tried by fire
[58:35] and only what stands at the end
[58:38] is going to be what matters
[58:41] and so we we're 84 lumber well you you
[58:44] want some two by fours we'll give you
[58:46] some two by fours
[58:47] we'll give you some drywall we'll give
[58:49] you what you need you need
[58:50] what whatever it is that's the the job
[58:52] of the five-fold ministry to supply you
[58:54] with the material to build a life
[58:56] with christ
[59:00] and so he says and we're going to get
[59:02] judged for what we say amen
[59:04] that's right this morning he says the
[59:06] the the scripture and you'll forgive me
[59:08] for time we won't go back but
[59:09] but but it says that they'll stand with
[59:12] them and brother branham remember when
[59:13] he went beyond the curtain of time he
[59:15] was gathered with his people amen
[59:18] we'll be gathered with ours you all be
[59:20] standing under brother samuel's
[59:22] uh ministry and now my group will be
[59:24] standing under me and we'll be standing
[59:26] under the ministry of brother branham
[59:28] and and it'll all be in this kind of
[59:30] pyramid deal
[59:32] all coming back judged on what we did
[59:34] with what god gave us
[59:37] and so we find then that he says this
[59:40] having
[59:44] knowing therefore verse 11 the terror of
[59:47] the lord knowing that
[59:48] that someday there's going to be a
[59:50] judgment and we'll have to stand before
[59:53] him
[59:53] he said he says knowing therefore the
[59:54] terror of the lord the seriousness of
[59:56] the situation
[59:58] we are made manifest unto god but also
[1:00:00] made manifest unto you
[1:00:01] and we persuade men amen
[1:00:06] i'm not a salesman but i'm a billboard
[1:00:08] and i'm trying to
[1:00:10] each one of us ministers and your
[1:00:12] ministry is to be a billboard
[1:00:14] to display christ
[1:00:17] to a lost and dying word to a world to
[1:00:19] be a light
[1:00:21] in darkness it's part of your ministry
[1:00:24] one of of reconciliation because the
[1:00:26] world is in it's in it's in a state
[1:00:29] of chaos because when this unity that we
[1:00:32] spoke of here in the garden
[1:00:33] when sin entered the picture instantly
[1:00:37] instantly unity was broken
[1:00:41] here comes god in the cool of the
[1:00:43] evening adam didn't cry out to him
[1:00:45] adam didn't run to him he ran away from
[1:00:47] him
[1:00:48] and here comes god down in the cool the
[1:00:50] evening adam
[1:00:52] adam where are you adam
[1:00:56] calling out to adam unity was broken i
[1:00:59] was afraid
[1:01:00] i was afraid so i hate myself he'd never
[1:01:03] they'd never felt fear before they had
[1:01:05] they never experienced what fear was can
[1:01:07] you imagine
[1:01:09] horrible that must have been yeah from a
[1:01:12] small child we understand fear we have
[1:01:14] that feeling we
[1:01:15] we feel terror we're terror we feel
[1:01:17] anxiety and
[1:01:18] all of those a result of unity being
[1:01:21] broken because perfect love casts out
[1:01:23] all fear
[1:01:25] but because of that unity being broken
[1:01:27] now we now we have anxiety problems now
[1:01:29] we have depression
[1:01:30] now we have oppression we have all kinds
[1:01:33] of issues we have
[1:01:34] fears and worries we have all these
[1:01:37] things and here adam i
[1:01:38] hid myself because i was afraid he had
[1:01:41] never felt that before
[1:01:44] i don't know how we don't know how long
[1:01:45] it was that adam and eve were in the
[1:01:47] garden before the fall
[1:01:49] because time didn't matter it wasn't
[1:01:53] kept track of
[1:01:54] because they were in eternity but when
[1:01:57] sin enters the picture the clock begins
[1:02:00] to tick
[1:02:02] fear enters the picture and now they're
[1:02:04] separating themselves from god
[1:02:06] hiding and as soon as god confronts him
[1:02:08] with the issue he says
[1:02:09] the woman you gave me
[1:02:12] now remember just a just a few verses
[1:02:16] earlier the bible tells us that adam was
[1:02:19] not deceived
[1:02:21] adam looked upon his fallen wife
[1:02:25] adam he was in his pre-fallen state
[1:02:28] he was in a clarity of mind
[1:02:31] he knew exactly what he was doing
[1:02:35] and he looked upon her and he made a
[1:02:38] decision
[1:02:40] and i'll leave you with this question
[1:02:43] did he make the wrong decision
[1:02:48] oh that's a deep question did he break
[1:02:51] god's word
[1:02:54] that's a deep question because while he
[1:02:57] may have disobeyed the letter of the
[1:02:59] word he kept the spirit of the word
[1:03:03] because he could do no different than
[1:03:05] what he did because he was his father's
[1:03:07] son
[1:03:07] amen amen
[1:03:13] the second adam did the same thing that
[1:03:16] the first adam did
[1:03:18] he became sin that through his
[1:03:21] poverty i might become rich in the
[1:03:24] righteousness of god
[1:03:27] he did the same thing
[1:03:31] and then he's willing to die for her
[1:03:34] and then a few verses later he said well
[1:03:36] it's her fault
[1:03:40] what had happened unity
[1:03:43] had been broken fellowship
[1:03:46] had been broken and god was desiring
[1:03:50] to get that fellowship back and before
[1:03:53] the foundation of the earth
[1:03:54] he slew a lamb to restore that
[1:03:57] fellowship
[1:03:58] and the promise was was was moving on
[1:04:01] through time looking for
[1:04:02] looking for one who could fulfill the
[1:04:04] promise looking for one who could answer
[1:04:06] the call looking for one
[1:04:07] who would restore back all that adam
[1:04:10] lost
[1:04:10] and christ was born to restore it and
[1:04:13] that work that he began 2 000 years ago
[1:04:16] this bride will finish up
[1:04:24] you're bought with a price you're not
[1:04:26] your own
[1:04:31] so we verse 19 brother to wit that god
[1:04:33] was in christ
[1:04:35] reconciling the world unto himself not
[1:04:38] imputing their trespasses into them
[1:04:42] and hath committed unto us the word of
[1:04:44] reconciliation
[1:04:46] so this idea of reconciliation
[1:04:48] alienation this is not unique to first
[1:04:50] or second corinthians uh well it's not
[1:04:53] unique to any book of the bible
[1:04:54] the whole bible talks about alienation
[1:04:57] and restoration
[1:04:59] so in colossians chapter 1 verse 19
[1:05:03] it tells us this for it please the
[1:05:05] father that in
[1:05:06] him should all fullness dwell
[1:05:10] so in order to restore fellowship god
[1:05:14] came himself no one else could do it
[1:05:18] he came himself to do it and having made
[1:05:21] peace
[1:05:22] through the blood of his cross what if
[1:05:24] brother graham said it's not going to be
[1:05:26] your denomination it's not going to be
[1:05:27] your creed it's not going to be your
[1:05:28] philosophy it's not going to be the name
[1:05:29] of the door it's not going to be who
[1:05:30] your pastor was they're not believing
[1:05:32] that god's not a prophet
[1:05:33] it's through the blood of jesus christ
[1:05:36] by him to reconcile all things unto
[1:05:40] himself and by him i say whether they be
[1:05:42] things in earth or
[1:05:43] things in heaven he bought it all back
[1:05:46] every bit of it and you you that were
[1:05:49] sometimes
[1:05:50] alienated what does that mean fellowship
[1:05:53] is broken
[1:05:55] alienated when when uh if you say well
[1:05:58] those those brothers need to reconcile
[1:06:00] that means that they're alienated from
[1:06:01] one another there's a break in
[1:06:03] fellowship they're no longer buddies
[1:06:06] and something has to take place to
[1:06:08] reconcile that relationship
[1:06:10] to bring them together and so he's
[1:06:12] reconciled us
[1:06:14] we were sometimes alienated and enemies
[1:06:17] oh we weren't just drifting away from
[1:06:19] him
[1:06:21] we were flat out enemies to god
[1:06:30] where in your mind oh you may not have
[1:06:34] said it
[1:06:35] you may not have acted it but i tell you
[1:06:38] what goes on between these ears
[1:06:43] that's why we need to be transformed by
[1:06:46] the renewing of our mind
[1:06:50] by our wicked works yet now he hath
[1:06:53] reconciled how do you do it in the body
[1:06:56] of his flesh through death
[1:06:58] to present you holy unblameable
[1:07:01] and unreprovable in his sight and this
[1:07:04] ties back to the idea of
[1:07:06] of not imputing their trespasses unto
[1:07:09] them david said blessed is
[1:07:10] a man to whom god does not impute sin
[1:07:13] blessed is the man to whom god doesn't
[1:07:15] keep track of your sin
[1:07:17] god doesn't keep it in his book it's in
[1:07:19] the sea of god's forgetfulness
[1:07:22] there it's kept and he puts up a big old
[1:07:25] sign that says no fishing
[1:07:28] and that means i can't go fishing for my
[1:07:30] sins and i can't go fishing for your
[1:07:32] sins once they're in there
[1:07:33] they're in there leave them
[1:07:36] in there that's why he said don't know
[1:07:39] don't know any man
[1:07:40] after the flesh this is why he he
[1:07:42] introduces that concept we're new
[1:07:44] creations
[1:07:46] what you did before i tell you leave it
[1:07:48] there
[1:07:49] what happened before leave it in the
[1:07:51] dust
[1:07:52] do not carry that guilt do not carry
[1:07:54] that shame do not
[1:07:56] carry that cloud do not let it walk all
[1:07:58] over you do not drag it with you you are
[1:08:00] a new creature in christ jesus
[1:08:02] [Music]
[1:08:04] thank god sir thank god
[1:08:10] but we we drag stuff up all the time
[1:08:17] how many of you in the middle of night
[1:08:19] the devil shows up
[1:08:21] with the daily catch
[1:08:26] well i've been fishing today you know he
[1:08:28] did the same thing to god where
[1:08:30] where you been oh i've been wandering to
[1:08:31] the throat
[1:08:33] just wandering to and fro doing what
[1:08:35] well i've been fishing do you know what
[1:08:38] brother so-and-so did
[1:08:39] yeah god says
[1:08:43] no i can't can't find it can't find it
[1:08:45] hey
[1:08:46] devil says i got a youtube video bro
[1:08:50] hello god right here man
[1:08:55] god says well i'm checking the official
[1:08:56] record i don't see you
[1:08:58] and since mine's the only one that
[1:09:00] counts
[1:09:02] your evidence is inadmissible
[1:09:05] oh thank god
[1:09:08] [Applause]
[1:09:11] blessed is the man to whom god does not
[1:09:13] impute sin this is psalms 32 1
[1:09:16] blessed is he whose transgression is
[1:09:17] forgiveness sin is covered blessed is
[1:09:19] the man to whom god imputed not iniquity
[1:09:21] in his spirit
[1:09:22] there is no guile in rome
[1:09:25] and this was so good paul had to quote
[1:09:27] it in romans 4 6 he says even
[1:09:29] david also described the blessings of
[1:09:30] the man unto whom god imputed
[1:09:32] righteousness
[1:09:33] without works and this is what what what
[1:09:36] paul is talking about here in second
[1:09:37] corinthians
[1:09:38] not only not only if we get to verse 21
[1:09:42] second corinthians 4 i know five i know
[1:09:44] i'm jumping around
[1:09:46] hang on in second corinthians 5 21 he
[1:09:51] says for he hath made him
[1:09:53] to be sin for us
[1:09:57] that we might be made the righteous
[1:09:59] righteousness of god
[1:10:00] in him so it's not only that god doesn't
[1:10:03] keep
[1:10:04] track but god switches the names
[1:10:07] on the bank accounts
[1:10:14] you had a debt you could not pay amen
[1:10:19] not in a billion lifetimes
[1:10:22] there was nothing that people think well
[1:10:24] if i'm a good person i can outweigh the
[1:10:26] bad i've done with the good
[1:10:28] you could never do it you don't even
[1:10:30] know the damage you've wreaked in your
[1:10:32] life
[1:10:33] some idle world word or thing that you
[1:10:36] didn't even know
[1:10:37] leaves your lips and once that arrow
[1:10:39] leaves the bow you cannot call it back
[1:10:41] brother and that does damage and hurt
[1:10:44] and pain
[1:10:45] that anyone who's married to tell you
[1:10:46] pop up 10 years later
[1:10:51] where did that come from
[1:10:54] well you said i i don't i didn't say i
[1:10:57] didn't say that
[1:10:58] oh yes she she's got a better memory
[1:11:00] than you do fellas
[1:11:03] because you remember what you meant
[1:11:07] she remembers what you said
[1:11:11] oh we're not going to get into marriage
[1:11:12] counseling tonight but
[1:11:15] men and women are different yes
[1:11:19] you say one thing she hears another amen
[1:11:22] [Music]
[1:11:24] but we we leave wreckage in our path we
[1:11:27] say things and we do things and all
[1:11:28] those things
[1:11:30] and we need someone to pay the debt yeah
[1:11:34] and so god takes that huge debt that
[1:11:37] huge account that we've accumulated over
[1:11:39] our life and not only
[1:11:40] not only the sins that we made in our
[1:11:42] past before we come to him and
[1:11:44] we become new creatures but even the
[1:11:46] sins and mistakes that we make after we
[1:11:48] become
[1:11:49] christians and the sins you're going to
[1:11:52] make
[1:11:54] brother bram says you're going to have
[1:11:55] problems in this flesh right up until
[1:11:57] the day you get out of here
[1:12:00] you're going to have battles right up
[1:12:02] until the day there's always the
[1:12:03] question of
[1:12:04] when do i get to a point to where i
[1:12:05] won't have any struggles
[1:12:07] it's the day you step from this body to
[1:12:09] the next
[1:12:12] you're in this world there will be
[1:12:15] trouble
[1:12:16] right but be of good cheer he's overcome
[1:12:19] the world
[1:12:22] and so god takes that debt and he
[1:12:24] switches the names on the account
[1:12:27] jesus was judged by pilate
[1:12:32] i find him innocent he's not guilty of
[1:12:34] anything
[1:12:35] shuffles them off to herod what do you
[1:12:39] think of him
[1:12:39] herod looks at him and says i find no
[1:12:42] fault at all
[1:12:44] he was judged in every every way
[1:12:47] and found perfect his account
[1:12:50] was full full of what righteousness was
[1:12:54] god
[1:12:56] and we who were alienated we owed a debt
[1:12:59] we could never pay
[1:13:01] and at calvary god switched the names on
[1:13:04] the account
[1:13:06] he took your debt and laid it upon him
[1:13:10] and he took the wealth of heaven and
[1:13:12] gave it to you
[1:13:14] oh what what a glorious reconciliation
[1:13:19] he not only restored our fellowship but
[1:13:22] he wiped away our deaths
[1:13:23] and he made us rich in christ
[1:13:36] but how many have heard the term entropy
[1:13:41] a few few of you i know i'm using big
[1:13:43] words it's not because i'm smart
[1:13:48] but god created this world and remember
[1:13:50] it was without form with
[1:13:52] void and god it took effort from god
[1:13:55] to place it into order and he put man
[1:13:58] there to keep it in order
[1:13:59] and then when sin enters the picture
[1:14:02] things begin to spiral out of control
[1:14:05] now there's thorns and thistles now by
[1:14:08] the sweat of
[1:14:09] the brow man has to earn his living
[1:14:12] didn't before that if you wanted an
[1:14:13] apple you didn't have to wait till fall
[1:14:15] didn't have to ship it from south
[1:14:17] america
[1:14:20] it was there all the time whatever they
[1:14:22] had in need of
[1:14:24] it was perfect harmony perfect unity
[1:14:26] that fellowship is broken
[1:14:28] sin enters into the world and then this
[1:14:30] concept of entropy and you'll you'll
[1:14:32] you'll hear this a lot of times in
[1:14:34] people who are debating creation and
[1:14:36] things like this but the
[1:14:37] second law of thermodynamics brings in
[1:14:39] this ideal of entropy
[1:14:41] entropy in that things do not get better
[1:14:45] over time
[1:14:50] if you go out tonight and if you can
[1:14:52] find one
[1:14:53] you bought a brand new gmc truck
[1:14:57] and you took that brand spanking new
[1:14:59] truck with two miles on it
[1:15:01] and you park it in your backyard and you
[1:15:05] leave it for 20 years
[1:15:08] it will not be better at the end of that
[1:15:11] 20 years
[1:15:12] than the day you bought it it won't even
[1:15:15] be as good
[1:15:17] as it was the day you bought it
[1:15:21] things decay over time
[1:15:24] things drift apart over time
[1:15:27] you can't even you say well i'll just
[1:15:29] park it in my garage and i'll leave it
[1:15:30] there
[1:15:31] that doesn't even work no you got to
[1:15:34] change the fluids every once in a while
[1:15:35] you got to fire it up every once in a
[1:15:37] while you got to
[1:15:38] let the condensation evaporate out of it
[1:15:41] you've got to roll it so you don't get
[1:15:42] flat spots on the tire there's
[1:15:44] work to do to maintain
[1:15:48] order there's something that has to be
[1:15:51] done
[1:15:52] because i know i'm speaking tonight
[1:15:53] there and i pray if there's someone here
[1:15:56] that
[1:15:56] does not know god who has not come into
[1:15:58] a relationship with god
[1:15:59] who does not know him for their savior
[1:16:01] who doesn't ha does not know
[1:16:03] for sure that they've moved beyond a
[1:16:06] justification
[1:16:08] move beyond sanctification but they've
[1:16:09] entered into that holiest of holies
[1:16:11] they've
[1:16:12] entered into that shekinah glory they've
[1:16:13] come into a new birth
[1:16:17] if you have not come to that place i say
[1:16:21] to you
[1:16:21] be reconciled to god that's the process
[1:16:25] of reconciliation
[1:16:27] but but i'm speaking for the most part
[1:16:30] to mature believers and know this
[1:16:32] that ministry of reconciliation isn't
[1:16:35] just out there to a lost and dying world
[1:16:37] as a ministry of reconciliation and
[1:16:39] keeping you
[1:16:41] in fellowship because the law of
[1:16:44] thermodynamics the
[1:16:45] the that ideal of entropy is that this
[1:16:48] if we don't maintain
[1:16:51] things decay
[1:16:58] things in this world you build a brand
[1:17:00] new house
[1:17:01] you know you think well i'm not going to
[1:17:02] have to do any repairs or any work on it
[1:17:04] for a few years
[1:17:10] you got to mow the grass
[1:17:14] stuff breaks things happen you got
[1:17:17] little ones
[1:17:18] you get real good at patching drywall
[1:17:21] and pain crayon off the walls
[1:17:25] just through everyday living things
[1:17:28] decay
[1:17:29] and through your everyday walk with
[1:17:31] christ
[1:17:33] we drift oh yeah we drift
[1:17:39] oh it's not you can be you can live a
[1:17:42] good life you could
[1:17:43] i'm not doing anything wrong i'm not
[1:17:44] going out in the world i'm not visiting
[1:17:46] the bars i'm not running around i'm not
[1:17:47] doing all these different things i'm not
[1:17:49] i'm not doing sin i'm not doing all
[1:17:50] these things
[1:17:52] you're just parking the car in the
[1:17:56] backyard
[1:17:59] and time we begin to drift
[1:18:04] things begin to drift away and
[1:18:06] fellowship gets
[1:18:12] and so this this ministry of
[1:18:14] reconciliation part of it is
[1:18:16] keeping us in tune
[1:18:19] with the almighty right it's not
[1:18:23] just to the world out there but it's in
[1:18:25] here amen
[1:18:26] uh staying in communion us staying
[1:18:30] in fellowship us staying in lockstep
[1:18:32] with him
[1:18:33] because over time we'll just drift we'll
[1:18:35] just
[1:18:36] if you you take a boat and you put it
[1:18:39] out in the middle of a lake
[1:18:41] there may not be a current may not be a
[1:18:44] breeze
[1:18:44] but you just put it alongside the dock
[1:18:46] you say i don't need a rope
[1:18:48] it'll be fine
[1:18:51] i don't need them there's no motor on it
[1:18:53] there's no sail it'll be fine
[1:18:55] and you wander away well it'll wander
[1:18:58] away
[1:19:01] and if you want that boat you're going
[1:19:02] to have to go for a swim
[1:19:05] it has simply drifted away
[1:19:10] remember joseph and mary they're in
[1:19:13] jerusalem and they're there with jesus
[1:19:15] and they're
[1:19:15] loading up to head out with a caravan
[1:19:17] and they've they've got the
[1:19:19] they've got the truck loaded and they've
[1:19:20] got their suitcases in there and
[1:19:22] everything
[1:19:22] you see jesus yeah he's over there and
[1:19:25] they get in there driving down the road
[1:19:28] on their camels
[1:19:34] we had a brother a friend of mine dear
[1:19:35] friend of mine
[1:19:38] was driving one night late at night his
[1:19:40] wife was laying over in the seat covered
[1:19:41] up in blankets they were
[1:19:42] coming back from some meetings and she
[1:19:44] was tired and laying over there sleeping
[1:19:46] and he just stopped real quick to use
[1:19:47] the restroom got out used the restroom
[1:19:49] jumped back in his vehicle
[1:19:51] going down the road
[1:19:55] and some of you know where this is going
[1:20:01] he didn't push her out
[1:20:04] he didn't ask her to leave but his phone
[1:20:08] rang
[1:20:11] he flipped open his phone it's two
[1:20:13] o'clock in the morning i don't recognize
[1:20:14] this number who in the world would just
[1:20:16] be
[1:20:18] so luckily he didn't just say and hang
[1:20:21] up
[1:20:23] he answered it and his wife said where
[1:20:26] are you
[1:20:36] he didn't mean neglect so great of
[1:20:38] salvation
[1:20:43] he didn't mean to but he had to turn
[1:20:47] around and come back
[1:20:49] to restore fellowship
[1:20:56] and let me tell you friends it was a lot
[1:20:58] of work to restore fellowship
[1:21:03] we find joseph and mary
[1:21:06] and i use that story to illustrate just
[1:21:09] how easy it is
[1:21:12] even in ministry we get so busy doing
[1:21:15] things like as we talked about moses
[1:21:16] this morning
[1:21:17] he's going off to save uh the
[1:21:20] israelites from egypt he's going there
[1:21:22] to confront pharaoh you want to talk
[1:21:24] about having a lot on your plate
[1:21:26] you want to talk about you're all
[1:21:27] consumed with this mission that god has
[1:21:29] placed you upon
[1:21:31] that you forget the mission his wife was
[1:21:34] one of those that needed saving
[1:21:36] his children were one of those who
[1:21:38] needed saving
[1:21:40] and he's he forgets all about him and
[1:21:42] god confronts him at the end is going to
[1:21:43] kill him
[1:21:45] and his wife stepped in to restore
[1:21:48] fellowship
[1:21:50] because he hadn't even done what needed
[1:21:52] to be done for his own family and we
[1:21:54] we can get so busy and so caught up
[1:21:57] that we doing things for god that we
[1:22:00] forget god we move away from god and as
[1:22:03] ministers and even in your ministry
[1:22:05] whatever it might be we can get so
[1:22:07] caught up in in doing things for god
[1:22:09] that somehow we
[1:22:10] think that we're still in lockstep in
[1:22:13] communion with god when somehow we've
[1:22:15] left him
[1:22:15] along the way we begin saying prayers
[1:22:19] instead of praying
[1:22:21] we begin going into a routine and and
[1:22:24] just
[1:22:25] it gets to a place to where to where we
[1:22:27] think he's along in the vehicle
[1:22:29] we got joseph and mary in the vehicle
[1:22:31] and they're moving down the road
[1:22:33] and they get three days out and suddenly
[1:22:34] they realize he's not there
[1:22:38] and gotta turn around and come back and
[1:22:41] god desires
[1:22:44] my reconciliation amen
[1:22:47] paul paul is crying out and this is the
[1:22:51] ministry of the bride the spirit and the
[1:22:53] bride say
[1:22:53] come on when fellowship was lost in the
[1:22:58] garden cherubims were put there with
[1:23:00] flaming swords
[1:23:01] keeping them away from the tree of life
[1:23:04] saying
[1:23:04] don't go near it but now god has given
[1:23:07] this ministry to the pride he's given
[1:23:09] this ministry to us
[1:23:11] not to keep people away but to say come
[1:23:15] come to the tree of life and eat freely
[1:23:17] if you're a thirst come to the tree of
[1:23:19] life
[1:23:22] we've all we all know someone
[1:23:26] we all have family members we have
[1:23:28] children we have brothers we have
[1:23:30] sisters we have parents we have uncles
[1:23:32] we have ants we
[1:23:34] we're we're kinsmen redeemers to them no
[1:23:37] one else will enter into prayer for them
[1:23:39] brother wade and brother samuel uh the
[1:23:41] different brothers
[1:23:43] it's not their job to be you're a closer
[1:23:45] kinsman all right
[1:23:50] your life should be screaming out to
[1:23:52] them be
[1:23:53] ye reconciled to god amen
[1:23:58] i'm not talking about conforming to some
[1:24:00] standard of religion i'm trying to look
[1:24:02] the part
[1:24:04] well if we could just get them we could
[1:24:05] just get them into a dress if we could
[1:24:07] just get their hair to be long if we
[1:24:08] could just get that fella to cut his
[1:24:10] hair if we could just
[1:24:11] get him to cover up those tattoos if we
[1:24:13] could just get him to do those things
[1:24:14] no if we could just get them to christ
[1:24:18] get them into a relationship with
[1:24:20] almighty god
[1:24:23] get them to they know this god who loves
[1:24:26] them and has been calling to them
[1:24:30] we get people who who well you know once
[1:24:32] i give up this
[1:24:34] i'll come to church how many have heard
[1:24:36] that
[1:24:37] i've got these problems i've got this
[1:24:39] situation you know once once i get that
[1:24:41] sorted out you know i'll be there i'll
[1:24:42] be there i'll be there
[1:24:48] they'll never be there nope that's right
[1:24:50] they'll never be
[1:24:51] there because you can't clean yourself
[1:24:55] you can't fix yourself come as you are
[1:24:59] and let god do the process let god do
[1:25:02] the cleaning let god do the thing
[1:25:04] if you've got problems and i could take
[1:25:07] a show of hands when i know the answer
[1:25:08] how many of y'all got problems
[1:25:12] all have sinned and come short of the
[1:25:14] glory of god
[1:25:15] we've all got just because my issues
[1:25:17] ain't your issues don't mean i ain't got
[1:25:19] issues
[1:25:21] we've all got places we've all got
[1:25:23] weaknesses we've all got places where we
[1:25:25] need to grow
[1:25:26] and i know this because we're still here
[1:25:28] man
[1:25:32] but if we take those things and we say
[1:25:34] well i can't
[1:25:37] i can't go or you know at church
[1:25:42] just keep coming
[1:25:47] keep getting into his presence
[1:25:51] let his word wash it
[1:25:57] well i just feel like a hypocrite
[1:26:01] god saves hypocrites too amen
[1:26:08] coming let the word wash you
[1:26:11] let the word change you let god bring
[1:26:15] you back into fellowship with himself
[1:26:17] because
[1:26:17] know this we get people who say well
[1:26:21] you know i i just don't i think god's
[1:26:23] done with me i think he's
[1:26:24] i've gone too far i've said too much
[1:26:26] i've made too many mistakes i
[1:26:28] you don't know what i've done you don't
[1:26:29] know this you don't know that and the
[1:26:30] question i always ask the question
[1:26:32] that's always at the bottom is
[1:26:33] do you feel any desire at all towards
[1:26:35] god whatsoever
[1:26:36] and if they say yes of course i do but i
[1:26:38] i just feel like i've gone
[1:26:40] if you feel any desire towards god
[1:26:43] whatsoever
[1:26:44] god had to place that desire there
[1:26:48] there is nothing in man that would cause
[1:26:50] him to seek god
[1:26:51] adam ran from god so if there
[1:26:55] he said no one can come to me unless the
[1:26:57] father draws him and so if there's
[1:26:58] something knocking at the door
[1:27:00] those of you who are praying for that
[1:27:01] loved one for that son for that daughter
[1:27:03] for that wayward brother for that
[1:27:04] wayward sister for that mom or parent or
[1:27:06] what whoever it is
[1:27:08] know this if there's something there
[1:27:09] don't give up hope don't get
[1:27:11] just just keep there letting your life
[1:27:13] be a light be salty to them
[1:27:15] love them express the love of christ to
[1:27:18] them
[1:27:18] keep reaching out and when i say be
[1:27:20] reconciled i'm not talking about
[1:27:22] get get in church and look a certain way
[1:27:24] i'm not talking about paying your tithes
[1:27:26] i'm not talking about all those things
[1:27:27] that'll come
[1:27:28] much later the important thing is is
[1:27:31] they come to
[1:27:32] know the almighty god and enter into
[1:27:34] that fellowship that god has desired
[1:27:36] from the foundation of the earth and
[1:27:38] that the two become one once again
[1:27:40] and through that process of the new
[1:27:42] birth his spirit is
[1:27:44] deposited within them and they're no
[1:27:46] longer alienated
[1:27:47] but they're family amen
[1:27:51] this is the mission this is the mission
[1:27:54] of ministry
[1:27:55] for god so loved the world that he gave
[1:27:58] his only begotten son
[1:28:00] that whosoever believeth in him should
[1:28:02] not perish but have everlasting life
[1:28:05] and i know that that's to some of you oh
[1:28:08] yeah i've heard that's a tired old
[1:28:10] uh methodist sermon or a methodist idea
[1:28:13] no that's the word of god for god sent
[1:28:16] his son
[1:28:16] not into the world to condemn the world
[1:28:18] but that the world through him might
[1:28:20] be saved when we're out of here
[1:28:23] judgment's going to hit
[1:28:25] and so it's our our final voice to this
[1:28:28] world is completing this ministry not to
[1:28:30] condemn it
[1:28:31] but that through us it might be saved
[1:28:37] as many as you can and whether they're
[1:28:39] bright or not or whether they're foolish
[1:28:41] virgins or not
[1:28:42] or whether they're this or that that's
[1:28:44] not for me to know that's not for you to
[1:28:45] know
[1:28:46] every person that you come in contact
[1:28:48] with is a potential son or daughter of
[1:28:50] god
[1:28:51] and need to be treated with the same
[1:28:53] respect
[1:28:55] and love that brought you to know him
[1:28:58] amen
[1:29:04] and he that believeth on him is not
[1:29:06] condemned but he that believeth not is
[1:29:08] condemned already because he hath not
[1:29:10] believed in the name of the only
[1:29:11] begotten son of god
[1:29:14] and to sum the mission up
[1:29:19] god came to restore unity to restore
[1:29:21] fellowship
[1:29:23] that's still the mission still the
[1:29:25] mission hasn't changed
[1:29:27] calvary made it possible and we're still
[1:29:31] doing it brother and his ministry part
[1:29:35] of his ministry
[1:29:36] was a restoration ministry and the bride
[1:29:39] of jesus christ and continuing that
[1:29:40] ministry as well amen
[1:29:43] there's we don't have to restore the
[1:29:44] word but we have to restore
[1:29:47] or be the culmination of that word on
[1:29:50] display
[1:29:57] so first timothy 1 and i'll end on this
[1:30:00] the musicians can come
[1:30:01] because i'm just flat wore out
[1:30:10] first timothy 1 15 this is a faithful
[1:30:14] saying and worthy of all
[1:30:15] acceptation that christ jesus came into
[1:30:18] the world
[1:30:20] to save sinners yes of whom
[1:30:24] i am chief amen and let me break it down
[1:30:28] for you
[1:30:28] christ the messiah the king of kings the
[1:30:32] lord of lords
[1:30:33] the alpha and omega the anointed one
[1:30:36] he who comes in the name of the lord the
[1:30:39] great physician
[1:30:40] the great shepherd the mediator between
[1:30:42] god and man
[1:30:43] the one pointed forward to in all the
[1:30:45] old testament and the prophecy and the
[1:30:47] law
[1:30:48] and the prophets it's the
[1:30:51] the christ jesus which
[1:30:54] literally means the lord who saves
[1:30:57] came into the world god condescended
[1:31:02] was made a little lower than the angel
[1:31:04] stepped out of eternity into the
[1:31:05] corruption of mortality and was made
[1:31:07] subject to death
[1:31:09] and suffering to save
[1:31:12] to pay all the penalty of our sins
[1:31:16] as a substitute what was that penalty
[1:31:19] death not just of the body but of the
[1:31:22] soul in hell
[1:31:24] to save sinners all of us
[1:31:27] for we all like sheep have gone astray
[1:31:30] and we're all
[1:31:31] alienated from the presence of god
[1:31:34] without hope and in need of a savior
[1:31:38] and paul said of whom i am chief
[1:31:41] and i know above all others i need him
[1:31:45] amen for there is no good in me at all
[1:31:50] except for him
[1:31:54] this is the mission friends
[1:31:57] should you choose to accept it
[1:32:02] and it won't self-destruct
[1:32:05] but i'll tell you this it will disappear
[1:32:08] one day
[1:32:11] ready or not here he comes all right
[1:32:13] amen all the musicians come
[1:32:15] you love him tonight amen
[1:32:22] thank you all i've had a ball
[1:32:28] love y'all don't you come on up
