[25:28] Amen.
[25:30] Oh, I just love the Lord. It's such a
[25:33] pleasure to be here. I surely thank
[25:35] brother Sam for inviting me to come and
[25:38] brother Gavin for letting me tag along,
[25:40] you know. You know, actually when I come
[25:42] to the I was raised in church majority
[25:46] of my life, but when I said I got born
[25:48] again, the first actual message church
[25:51] I'd actually went to was brother
[25:53] Homer's. And brother Homer wasn't there.
[25:56] He was visiting preaching somewhere. And
[25:58] brother Gavin was actually the first
[25:59] person I ever heard preach a sermon in a
[26:02] message church. And I remember it was
[26:05] entitled, "To whom I believe, I report."
[26:07] Right. And that day it ministered to me
[26:10] a whole lot. And I remember standing
[26:12] there that day cuz you know I done life
[26:14] had done God done take me down a road to
[26:16] where I guess you could say I done had a
[26:19] Pentecostal experience in my life. God
[26:21] had used me in many ways. I was raised
[26:24] in a Pentecostal church. Pentecostal
[26:26] gifts, the gifts of the spirit was a
[26:29] normal thing. Right. You know, but
[26:31] actually receiving the word That's
[26:33] right. Without the Holy Ghost, you'll
[26:35] never receive the word. That's right.
[26:37] And I remember standing in that sermon
[26:39] that in that service that day and I
[26:40] thought, Lord, what is it that I'm to do
[26:43] now? Cuz there was something much in my
[26:45] heart and I knew, you know, I knew the
[26:47] Lord done give me the Holy Ghost a time
[26:49] when I was sitting at my house when the
[26:51] Lord actually gave me the ability to
[26:53] believe his word. Amen. And you know, I
[26:56] had not been water baptized correctly
[26:58] yet. You know, but you know, we know
[27:00] scripture that's still correct according
[27:02] to Cornelius's man. You know, as when
[27:04] they heard and they believed, they
[27:05] received that power from on high. And
[27:07] you know, I remember in that service,
[27:08] the Lord just laid on my heart, be water
[27:11] baptized. You know, cuz he g me that
[27:13] revelation, the very first revelation.
[27:15] And I just love Brother Gab a whole lot.
[27:18] Means a lot to me.
[27:20] Feel real tiny up here. I know I'm a big
[27:22] guy, but I feel real tiny. I sat in
[27:24] brother way Sunday school lesson, and to
[27:26] hear him teach, I thought I felt real
[27:29] small, you know. I mean, I really
[27:31] enjoyed it, you know. I definitely
[27:33] there's nothing I can tell you that you
[27:34] never heard before. I felt just like a
[27:36] little kid, but I love the Lord and he
[27:39] lives in my heart and I just want to
[27:41] share something we hope to lift you up.
[27:44] I'm going to read from Genesis
[27:46] 15 starting at chapter or chapter 15
[27:49] verse 4.
[27:58] If I had a title, the brother asked me
[28:01] said you had a title. I said I did until
[28:03] you asked me. My mind get to blame. But
[28:06] if I had a title, it would be God has
[28:10] provided himself a sacrifice.
[28:12] Yes.
[28:14] And behold, the word of the Lord came on
[28:16] him, saying, This shall not be thine
[28:19] air, but he that shall come forth out of
[28:21] thine own boughs, shall be thine air.
[28:24] And he brought him forth and brought us
[28:26] and said, "Look now towards heaven, tell
[28:29] the stars, and sh thou shalt be able to
[28:31] number them." And he said unto them, "So
[28:33] shall thy seed be." And he believed in
[28:36] the Lord, and he counted unto him for
[28:38] righteousness. And he said unto him, I
[28:40] am the Lord that brought thee out of out
[28:43] of the Chaldes to give thee this land to
[28:45] inherit it. And he said, Lord God,
[28:48] whereby shall I know that I shall
[28:50] inherit it? He said unto him, "Take me
[28:52] an heer of three years old, and a she
[28:55] goat of three years old, and a ram of
[28:56] three years old, and a turtle dove, and
[28:58] a young pigeon." And he took unto him
[29:01] all these, and divide them in a mist,
[29:03] and laid each piece one against another,
[29:05] but the birds divided he not. Now, let's
[29:08] skip down here to the 17th. And it came
[29:10] to pass that when the sun went down, and
[29:13] it was dark, behold, a smoking furnace,
[29:15] and a burning lamp that passed between
[29:17] those pieces. In the same day, the Lord
[29:19] made a made a covenant with Abraham. You
[29:22] may be seated. Thank you, Lord. And I
[29:25] really love looking here at Abraham
[29:26] because Abraham reminds me a lot of
[29:28] myself. Abraham, he had never received
[29:32] the oracles of God. He was a club on his
[29:35] back, he come out of the southern part
[29:37] of of u of Babylon. He worshiped Ruth.
[29:42] They worshiped idols. He had no idea of
[29:44] one god. He was never taught that in his
[29:47] whole life. I was never taught to be
[29:50] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[29:51] Christ. I was never taught the things
[29:53] that I've been taught when God brought
[29:55] this word to me. So when I look at
[29:57] Abraham and I know the word teaching me
[29:59] that Abraham is the father of my faith
[30:02] for that same covenant Abraham gave that
[30:05] God gave Abraham, God gave it to me
[30:07] also. It's an unconditional covenant.
[30:10] Not by what I knew, not by the
[30:11] intellects, not what my parents taught
[30:14] me, not by the church that ingrained
[30:16] their doctrines into me, but by the
[30:17] mighty hand of Hoba coming down and
[30:19] picking me up and saying, "I'm going to
[30:21] place my life inside of you. I'm going
[30:23] to put my mind inside of your soul. And
[30:26] from this day forth, you going to walk
[30:27] and possess the land that I have put
[30:29] before you."
[30:31] So therefore, I mean, I really when I
[30:33] look at Abraham, it makes me very
[30:34] excited. Amen. And I look here and it
[30:37] says, I'm going read some quotes here
[30:39] from all things. Brother Bram said,
[30:41] God's first decision was to pardon a man
[30:43] by the shed blood. That's right. And God
[30:45] cannot make the second decision against
[30:47] his first decision. If he did, then his
[30:50] first decision was wrong, and he
[30:51] couldn't be wrong and be God. That's
[30:53] right. Come on now. Come on down. He
[30:54] said, since that time, that's been God's
[30:56] only place of fellowship to meet with
[30:58] him. Before there, he met him in the
[31:00] Garden of Eden. No blood had to be
[31:03] necessary. But since that time, since
[31:04] the fall, his decision was to meet man
[31:07] back, redeemed by blood. It's been the
[31:10] only place that fellowship could be
[31:12] observed by God. It's the only place
[31:14] that God can meet a sinner. And we're
[31:16] all sinners by nature. It takes a blood
[31:19] sacrifice to bring us back into
[31:20] fellowship with Christ again. No other
[31:22] way. It is absolutely totally. That is
[31:26] the only way. And we know that looking
[31:28] back in the Garden of Eden, we know
[31:29] Genesis being the seed chapter. We see
[31:31] Cain and Well, we see Adam and Eve and
[31:34] when they fell, they were so embarrassed
[31:36] and they went and they hid themselves
[31:37] and they covered themselves with figal
[31:38] leaves and we know that that was nothing
[31:40] more than their own ideals, their own
[31:42] techniques to hide themselves from God.
[31:44] And then later on, here comes Cain and
[31:46] Abel. And when they come upon the earth,
[31:48] we know that brother Bren teaches us
[31:50] that they taught them their traditions
[31:52] and their doctrines. They taught Cain
[31:54] and Abel that hey, it was by the fruit
[31:57] that we failed. Of course, they wanted
[31:59] to cover up. Oh yeah. what they had
[32:01] done. Of course, it would be
[32:02] embarrassing. Here's Kane, an
[32:04] illegitimate child, basically. And Cain,
[32:06] you're really your daddy's really not
[32:07] Adam. It's is the beast. Of course, they
[32:10] wouldn't want to tell him that. And when
[32:11] I look back in my life growing up, I see
[32:15] things that was taught to me. I'd asked
[32:16] my parents at times, and God God knows
[32:19] my parents were some of the best people
[32:20] I think that ever walked the earth. They
[32:22] are not hypocrites. They live what they
[32:24] know, and they live it to the best of
[32:26] their ability. Sometimes they make me
[32:28] ashamed if you really want to know the
[32:30] truth, but they have not received truth.
[32:32] And there's things that was taught to me
[32:34] and I preachers and pastors, they sit
[32:36] there and they teach you say, "What
[32:37] about the Bible here?" When the Bible
[32:39] says this, well, it mean well, no, it
[32:41] don't really mean that. And the reason
[32:43] why most time is cuz they've already, if
[32:45] they're still walking alone, most time
[32:46] God's already presented them with truth.
[32:48] And at that time, they've already turned
[32:50] away from this truth, but yet they're
[32:51] still living a religious lifestyle.
[32:53] They're still receiving blessings.
[32:55] They're still getting healed. They're
[32:56] still financially blessed and they live
[32:58] a more victorious life than most of us
[33:00] do. And that's just the basic truth.
[33:02] Well, they still living in this
[33:04] religious facade, but yet they don't
[33:06] want to tell you the truth because if
[33:08] they do, then they're going to uncover
[33:10] their sin. Then they going to have to
[33:11] repent and they going to have to come
[33:13] and make things right and set a new
[33:14] example and actually stay before God.
[33:17] Well, here's Cain and Abel coming forth.
[33:18] And I and I can imagine, you know, when
[33:20] you see a child that has a defect or a
[33:23] child that has a problem, the parents
[33:25] kind of pamper that child. Even if the
[33:27] if the problem is not handicapping the
[33:29] child, they still kind of they pamper
[33:31] that child. They when they when they do
[33:33] things, they make excuses for why they
[33:35] do things. Well, a lot of parents do
[33:36] that regardless if the child's got
[33:38] problems or not. But anyhow, they sit
[33:40] there and they they pamper that child.
[33:42] Right. And I can see Cain out here cuz
[33:45] you know Cain did not have he did not
[33:48] have the same nature of his dead. He was
[33:51] a liar. He was a deceiver and he finally
[33:53] manifested himself as a murderer. We
[33:55] know that he did not have the
[33:56] characteristics of of Adam. So when he
[33:59] do things, I'm sure Abel and and
[34:01] everybody around would be like, you
[34:02] know, watch Kane and their mom and daddy
[34:04] because you know there's a secret there.
[34:07] Why does Cain act so much different than
[34:09] me? There's a secret there. They don't
[34:11] want that to be unleashed. They don't
[34:13] want him to know that. So throughout
[34:14] their whole life, they told him
[34:15] something totally different. And you
[34:18] know, here's Cain. He's a tiller of the
[34:20] ground. He produces the fruit. At this
[34:22] time, people did not eat animals. And
[34:25] here's Abel out there tending these
[34:27] stinking sheep for what
[34:30] purpose? I can't imagine, you know,
[34:32] here's Abel of of a kind nature. He has
[34:35] a nature of his daddy. Yeah. Right. He
[34:37] has a nature of God as much as he
[34:39] possibly can cuz he came from Adam. Here
[34:41] he is with his humble nature and he's
[34:43] out here and I can imagine what is he
[34:46] doing to provide for his family other
[34:47] than raising these sheep. Here's Kane
[34:49] out here with him being half beast. I'm
[34:51] sure he was probably bigger. He probably
[34:54] look more handsome. That's you know
[34:56] brother taught us that about the
[34:58] serpent. Well, here he is standing
[34:59] there. He produces all the food. I
[35:01] actually think him coming in one day and
[35:02] say, "Yeah, what what why' you donate to
[35:05] the family today?
[35:07] you know. Yeah. He said, "Well, I
[35:08] brought us all food today. I provide the
[35:10] whole family with food. My my two acres
[35:12] out here provided us with food. They
[35:14] provide us with live sufferings. What
[35:16] you provided us with?" You know, but see
[35:19] the thing is when I go back into the
[35:21] Bible and I look, you know, Proverbs
[35:22] tell us that the goats were for milk and
[35:24] for meat, but the sheep were for
[35:26] clothing. So, here's Abel tending these
[35:29] sheep for one reason. One reason only,
[35:31] to provide clothing. Right. Right. M
[35:35] God's only provided way of a sacrifice
[35:38] was through this blood to be the spill
[35:41] blood of that that that innocent lamb
[35:43] laying there. Yeah, I can imagine if
[35:46] anybody I know brother D. I know a lot
[35:48] of people in here I'm sure you hunt and
[35:50] you fish people farm. One of the
[35:54] scariest most horrible heart feeling
[35:56] things man. We went to brother homers to
[35:57] get a goat and I cleaned a lot of
[36:00] animals you know but when we took this
[36:02] goat his nanny and his sibl was there
[36:05] when we took it out of the pin they all
[36:07] just started crying. Yeah. And started
[36:09] pitching a fit because they knew
[36:11] something was wrong. They knew this goat
[36:14] was some going somewhere to the
[36:15] slaughter and they just cry and they'd
[36:17] cry. And I can just imagine Abel sitting
[36:20] out there in the field tending these
[36:22] sheep. The brother been harassing him
[36:24] all this time doing all these great
[36:26] works, providing for them. And he's
[36:29] standing there in the field crying,
[36:31] "Lord, why is it that I'm out here
[36:33] tending these sheep? Why is it that I
[36:35] got to take this rock and break their
[36:37] neck and cut them off and listen to them
[36:40] bleed and cry, get blood all over my
[36:42] hands? I have to rip their hide off and
[36:44] and disavow their entrance. My brother,
[36:47] he don't do nothing but go here and tear
[36:48] the ground and get all the glory. And
[36:50] all I do whenever we need new clothing,
[36:52] I'm over here and I got to do all this.
[36:54] You know, it breaks his heart to hear
[36:56] that lamb cry. You know, it did. He had
[36:58] the nature of God. Hey, I love to hunt,
[37:01] but I only kill so I can hunt. I don't
[37:03] hunt to kill. I hate to watch any animal
[37:06] die. But I can imagine Abel sitting
[37:08] there killing that lamb and he's
[37:10] screaming and crying and the blood
[37:13] coming at him, crying and waiting out to
[37:14] God and all of a sudden one day God just
[37:17] shows a flash in his mind and he sees
[37:19] God sitting on Calvary. He sees Jesus
[37:22] Christ sitting there and all a sudden a
[37:24] revelation breaks forth and he sees I
[37:26] remember my mom and daddy had a lamb. I
[37:29] remember they had clothes on them when
[37:30] they come out. They tell me about that.
[37:32] Where did he get that from? Who who
[37:35] crucified Ethan first? He stealed that
[37:37] first lamb. It was Jehovah. God provided
[37:41] his own sacrifice. He g his own
[37:44] clothing. And I can see everybody
[37:46] sitting there saying how God has
[37:48] provided a lamb for me. And even though
[37:51] he sit there and he was ridiculed by his
[37:54] intelligent brother. Oh yeah. His
[37:57] smarter brother. The one that made more
[38:00] money. The one that had a more luxurious
[38:02] car. Come on now. The one that took
[38:05] vacation three or four times a year. Oh
[38:08] Lord have mercy. He sit there and be
[38:10] persecuted by his more self-righteous
[38:13] brother. We know brother told us. He
[38:15] said Cain was a far better man than
[38:17] Abel.
[38:18] Esau was a far better man than Isaac
[38:24] or Jacob. And
[38:28] but where is the desire?
[38:31] Where's the nature of God? Where is the
[38:34] supernatural manifesting out into the
[38:36] natural? Anytime the supernatural
[38:38] manifests itself into the natural, that
[38:41] seed germ of God expressing himself in
[38:45] these five senses is always going to be
[38:47] ridiculed. It's going to be persecuted.
[38:50] It's going to be condemned. It's going
[38:51] to have to go through the hall of Christ
[38:53] before God can never put it to a place
[38:55] where it can be used. And I can see
[38:57] here, we know it's because the bloodshed
[39:00] that God accepted Abel's sacrifice.
[39:03] That's right. We know that. But the
[39:05] Bible says in Hebrews, it was by faith.
[39:08] Faith, we know, is a revelation. It's an
[39:11] understanding. It's not an intellectual
[39:14] indoctrination. It's not a memorization
[39:17] of of quotes. It's not a memorization of
[39:19] the Bible. It's not nothing of penance.
[39:22] It's not nothing that you can do. It's
[39:24] just something that most of the time
[39:25] when we out here living our daily life,
[39:27] scrubbing, trying to make ends meet in
[39:30] living for God, trying our best to walk
[39:33] one step in front of the other, trying
[39:34] to follow that life. God just flashes
[39:37] something in front of your eyes. No,
[39:39] it's not nothing that you can do. It's
[39:41] not nothing that you can do except for
[39:43] except yield to it and love him for it.
[39:47] Praise him for it. Oh, just worship him
[39:49] and just thank God that you're alive.
[39:52] Thank God that you can actually
[39:54] demonstrate God's nature to mankind.
[39:57] Amen. Amen. Amen. I can see Kane, you
[40:00] know, when he come
[40:01] up and offer the sacrifice to God. Yeah.
[40:06] And here's Abel. Man, you know, you
[40:09] know, Abel was not a hotty man. He was a
[40:12] humble man. He was a meek man. He was a
[40:14] lowly man. He had to be because that's
[40:16] the nature of God. That's the nature of
[40:18] his daddy. Here's Kane. Sure. He walks
[40:21] up there with this big pile of
[40:25] fruit. This the estate of his family. My
[40:29] parents told me that this was the most
[40:30] important thing. I've got their
[40:32] doctrines down to a pat. Yeah. I got
[40:35] their doctrines down to such a pat that
[40:37] when I go to church, they love me. They
[40:40] think I'm right with God. Oh yeah. They
[40:42] think I'm worshiping God. All my friends
[40:45] thinking I'm just fitting right in and
[40:47] they think I'm going to the ranch. I
[40:48] really don't know if I'm if I really got
[40:50] God in my life or not. But everybody
[40:52] else is happy. Everybody else believes
[40:54] I'm right on target. And not only that,
[40:56] if it wasn't for me, the church wouldn't
[40:57] be half of what it is. They wouldn't be
[40:59] able to have the facilities they got.
[41:01] They wouldn't have the nice equipment
[41:02] that they got. They wouldn't have none
[41:03] of that stuff if it wasn't for me. Yeah.
[41:06] So when he comes and he lays that before
[41:08] God, God said, "Uh, Amen. I don't know.
[41:12] I I really don't like that too much.
[41:14] That didn't come from me. Yeah. But when
[41:16] animal comes, he offers up the fatted
[41:19] lambs. That's all he had to offer. I'm
[41:22] sure he could have went to Cain and
[41:23] said, "Cane, can I have some of that
[41:25] fruit?" Yeah. You know, since that is
[41:28] the the substance of our lives, since
[41:29] that is what makes our lives go, since
[41:32] that is our daily
[41:34] food, can I have some of that? I believe
[41:36] that would be a better sacrifice to God.
[41:38] All my sacrifice is is is a spiritual
[41:40] revelation. Yeah. But no, it didn't work
[41:43] that way. Cuz see, God showed him
[41:45] something beyond the veil of time. God
[41:48] showed him his mind. He showed him his
[41:50] plan. The great God of this universe. He
[41:53] showed him himself to Abel. So when Abel
[41:55] walked up, he presented that God said,
[41:58] "I like that. I love that. That came
[42:01] from me. That didn't come from you. It
[42:03] didn't come from your mama. It didn't
[42:04] come from your daddy. It didn't come
[42:06] from your thinking. It didn't come from
[42:07] your ideas or your traditions. that came
[42:10] straight from me and I accept it. I love
[42:13] it. And I'm sure when Abel was out there
[42:16] in the field, I don't have anything to
[42:19] back this up. This is just me, but I'm
[42:21] sure when Cain and Abel was out there in
[42:23] the
[42:23] field, I just
[42:27] blessing. God has always had a path of
[42:30] redemption. God has always wanted to
[42:32] bring men into his bosom. I can see Abel
[42:35] out there with the nature of his daddy
[42:36] saying,
[42:37] "Ke, this is why I offered up a lamb.
[42:41] God showed me one day when I was out
[42:43] there crying." Y having a skinless lamb.
[42:46] God show me this. This is why. Well, God
[42:50] didn't show me nothing. That ain't what
[42:52] a mama and daddy teaches. That ain't
[42:53] what pastor so and so teach us. That
[42:55] ain't what mama says, daddy says, deacon
[42:58] says. That ain't where'd you get that
[43:01] from? But God told me. I don't believe
[43:03] in it. Oh yeah. Well, he did. And after
[43:07] a while, he had to believe it because
[43:08] God honored it. And then God honored me
[43:11] and God vindicated it.
[43:14] That's when he slew, right? I believe
[43:16] with my whole heart that Abel was out
[43:17] there trying to convert his brother
[43:19] because that's the nature of his daddy.
[43:21] Always has been to bring me into his
[43:23] bosom. I believe he'll stand there
[43:25] saying, "Cane, please, if you just do
[43:27] this, God will accept you. Listen to
[43:29] me." He couldn't do it. Pride. Pride
[43:33] will kill a man every single time. Not
[43:35] only will it kill him, it'll cause him
[43:37] to kill his brother. Every single time.
[43:40] Pride and envy. So, I truly believe
[43:43] that's exactly what happened to Abra.
[43:46] Hallelujah. Yes, sir. Amen. And I'm
[43:48] going come on down here.
[43:50] Looking at
[43:52] Abraham says here, first faith cometh by
[43:55] hearing, hearing the word of God. Then
[43:57] the believer hears it recognizes and
[44:00] acts upon it. The carnal man will hear
[44:02] it. That's right. Cain heard it. Right.
[44:06] God gave him a witness. God told him,
[44:08] "If you'll do as your brother do, you'll
[44:10] be fine." He gave him a witness. He
[44:12] always gives a man a way out.
[44:16] The carnal man will hear it. The sound
[44:18] of it, but never hears means to
[44:21] understand. Oh, come on now. Preach.
[44:23] Look at it. It's looking at something,
[44:25] but to see it is to understand it.
[44:27] Right? Except a man be born again, he
[44:30] cannot see or understand the kingdom of
[44:32] God. Right now, I'm fixing to say
[44:34] something. I want you to hear me out
[44:36] before you have any thoughts come
[44:38] through your mind.
[44:41] I hear, you know, I've only been born
[44:43] again, I say, for about eight years.
[44:45] I've been around God's re revealed word
[44:48] from that years. I come from the outside
[44:50] in. I come in brand new. Like I said,
[44:53] I'm like a little kid, right?
[44:55] But when I come in, you know, I hear
[44:57] people say often
[44:59] times, "Well, Brother Bam said it. I
[45:02] believe it. I said it. I just believe
[45:04] it. Brother B says, so I believe it."
[45:06] And hey, the saddest thing about this
[45:08] people like that about their pastor.
[45:09] Now, I believe God sent ordained
[45:11] ministers, pastor, to see you through. I
[45:13] thank God for the one I got. I love
[45:15] Brother Homer to death. God could have
[45:17] placed me with no other pastor. Come on.
[45:19] Except for Brother Homer. That's just
[45:21] the way I feel about him because that's
[45:22] where God put me. Amen. I mean, I I may
[45:25] not be there my whole life. That's
[45:26] right. But for the time God has me
[45:27] there, there ain't no other pastor. You
[45:29] say, "Well, maybe not for me." Well, I
[45:31] ain't talking about you. I'm talking
[45:32] about for me, cuz we're all different. I
[45:35] believe in a pastor. I believe in
[45:37] deacons, evangelists, teachers,
[45:39] apostles, prophets. I believe in that
[45:40] 100%.
[45:42] But people, they get, "Well, mama said
[45:44] this or daddy said this, and I believe
[45:45] it. Brother Brown said this, I believe
[45:48] it, and as long as I believe it, I'm
[45:49] going to heaven." That is the fattest
[45:51] lie of the devil I ever heard in my
[45:53] entire life. And the thing is to even
[45:55] say the correct terminology, I believe
[45:57] it, but yet you don't understand it, you
[46:00] don't believe it. That's right. Cuz to
[46:01] believe it, you got to understand it.
[46:03] You may agree with it, right? But
[46:06] agreeing with it don't do nothing but
[46:07] get you into a place of responsibility
[46:10] to agree with it. The devil agrees with
[46:12] it. Everybody that's ever heard it that
[46:13] has any kind of common sense. The
[46:15] majority of it, they agree with it. But
[46:18] agreeing with it won't do nothing but
[46:19] get you a fast ticket to hell and they
[46:21] should get born again. So when people
[46:23] say, "Well, I believe it. I don't
[46:24] understand it, but I believe it. As long
[46:26] as I believe it, I'm all right." That is
[46:27] a lie. That is a lie. We must press.
[46:31] Brother Graham says it right here. It's
[46:33] to understand it. He said a drunk will
[46:35] believe it on the street. He asked him,
[46:37] "You believe Jesus Christ son?" Oh, I
[46:39] believe. Intellectually, he agrees. But
[46:42] brother Brandham says that grace through
[46:45] intellectual knowledge. You first get
[46:46] intellectual knowledge. That's the first
[46:48] step. You got to become a recognization
[46:50] of the truth. But when that intellectual
[46:52] knowledge hits, brother Ram said, grace,
[46:55] grace drops in when the Holy Ghost and
[46:58] turns that intellectual knowledge into
[47:00] faith. So inside that soul where you
[47:02] once had doubt, it's now been turned
[47:04] into the faith of God. It's God's faith
[47:07] that makes you born again. And once you
[47:09] get born again, then brother said that
[47:12] seed it starts to grow and it drives out
[47:14] all the other seeds. It drives out every
[47:17] other seed. And to see how important
[47:19] that is. Oh, how important it is the
[47:22] only source of life. It is only source
[47:24] of life. Brother Graham taught us, you
[47:26] know, in the Old Testament, the high
[47:28] priest could only marry a virgin. That's
[47:30] the only thing he could marry. The only
[47:32] thing brother comes along marries
[47:34] divorce. He said that is a typhen of
[47:37] Christ and his bride. Now we know the
[47:39] regular priest they can marry a virgin
[47:42] or they can marry a widow of a priest.
[47:46] Blessing. This is the thing spiritually
[47:49] that's a spiritual type of Jesus Christ
[47:51] and the bride. Spiritually every one of
[47:53] us had a husband. I don't care if you're
[47:56] a male or female. And in a invisible
[47:59] union of Jesus Christ brother teaches us
[48:02] that we was all married to Satan. The
[48:04] Bible teaches that man has to die. He
[48:06] said you can't divorce that man. You
[48:08] can't put him up on the side. He has to
[48:10] die. But once you died, you ain't a
[48:13] virgin. Come on. You had a husband and
[48:16] that husband was not a priest. He was
[48:18] not a priesthood of a priesthood. It was
[48:21] not not at all. But that's why you got
[48:23] to be born again. And once you get born
[48:26] again, then it's just as if you never
[48:28] done it in the first place. People say,
[48:30] "Well, what is justification?
[48:33] You ain't never done it in the first
[48:34] place. I know brother Brandham said a
[48:36] woman leaves her leaves her virtue that
[48:39] she can't be justified in this lifetime.
[48:41] In this lifetime. Exactly. Amen.
[48:45] I I had a very rough I got a very rough
[48:51] past in a lot of ways that I'm very much
[48:53] ashamed of. But I also it's a testimony
[48:56] to God. That's right.
[48:59] Uh, if you ever see me weep and cry, I'm
[49:01] sure it's like to most of you. It's just
[49:02] cuz how much I love God and how much
[49:04] he's done for me. Amen. I got arrested
[49:07] when I was a young. I was probably I was
[49:09] 19 when I got arrested for possession of
[49:12] drugs. I pleaded youthful
[49:15] offender. And what that meant is that
[49:18] it's actually I don't ever have to put
[49:19] it on the resume. Come on. Nobody ever
[49:22] has to know that I was ever prosecuted
[49:26] or convicted of that. misdemeanor,
[49:28] right?
[49:30] But the judge, if I ever go back to
[49:34] court, the judge sees that record. Yeah.
[49:37] On my personal record, when they pull it
[49:39] up, they see playful offender,
[49:41] misdemeanor, class, you know, B felony,
[49:44] drug charge or
[49:46] misdemeanor. But see, I to that judge, I
[49:50] can't tell him I never did do that. I
[49:53] can tell my employee that.
[49:55] Now, in this lifestyle, if a woman was
[49:57] to lose her virtue, she can't tell her
[49:59] husband, "Well, I'm a virgin." You can't
[50:01] tell him that. If if if I get convicted
[50:04] of stealing something, you come up and
[50:05] said, "Jimmy, have you ever stole
[50:07] anything?" Well, yeah, I have. If I ask
[50:09] you if you're ever lied, yeah, I lied.
[50:11] But ask God that question. If you are
[50:14] dead in Christ and been born again, God
[50:16] says, "What are you talking about?" I
[50:18] don't know what you talking about.
[50:20] Unless you do it again, you never done
[50:22] it in the first place. God ain't like
[50:24] that judge that can see my misdemeanor
[50:26] because of a youthful offender plea. He
[50:27] can't see it. It is God justification. I
[50:32] I see people that I just wish Yeah. I
[50:36] can make them see justification because
[50:41] if God is saying can never come and bind
[50:44] you by your past, your whole victory is
[50:47] sacked. Anything that you think you can
[50:49] do in a supernatural walk, he takes it
[50:51] away from you. He strips it from you. He
[50:53] strips your faith. He strips your
[50:55] happiness. He strips your joy. He strips
[50:57] your healing. Everything your prayer
[50:59] life. It don't matter what it is. If he
[51:01] abides you by your past, I don't care
[51:04] how bad your past was. I don't care. I
[51:08] guarantee you a lot of too much worse
[51:09] than mine. I guarantee you. But see, the
[51:12] blood, the bleach blood of Jesus Christ,
[51:14] it does away with everyone. Don't you
[51:16] realize that's the only fellowship
[51:18] you'll ever have with God? and never get
[51:20] to the point that you never done in the
[51:22] first place. If you can't get to that
[51:23] point, you have no fellowship with God.
[51:26] He cannot fellowship with somebody that
[51:28] doubts and don't believe. You got to
[51:30] have faith to fellowship with God. And
[51:32] if you don't believe justifications, you
[51:34] ain't even to the first step yet. You
[51:36] ain't even there yet. Amen. So to
[51:39] believe and to
[51:42] understand is the same thing. And when
[51:45] you believe and understand, it creates
[51:47] an action. Amen. You do something. You
[51:50] don't sit there and say, "Well, let me
[51:52] turn to this page and let's record it.
[51:54] Flip over here. Yeah, that compares."
[51:56] Yeah, that Yeah. Yeah. Now, that's good.
[51:58] Yeah, I like that. And do all this right
[52:00] here. And uh that's wonderful. I got
[52:02] this figured out. Yeah. I And it don't
[52:05] change your life. You don't understand
[52:07] nothing. You may can teach it. You may
[52:10] can explain it, but you don't believe
[52:11] it. Cuz if you believe that, whatever
[52:13] you looking at, your life will line up
[52:15] to it. Now, there's things that we agree
[52:17] with. Now, you may want to say, "Well,
[52:19] we believe unto." That's all right. I
[52:22] understand. I understand what people
[52:24] say. I understand when people say,
[52:25] "Well, I believe it any." I understand
[52:27] what they mean, right? But the thing is,
[52:30] the devil is so slight. Brother
[52:32] Brandham, in a in a deep call to the
[52:34] deep, he said there, he says, he's
[52:36] talking about people that have visions.
[52:37] He's talking about seers has visions. He
[52:39] said their subconscious, their conscious
[52:40] mind are just like this right here. He
[52:41] said they're not really ever asleep.
[52:43] They're not ever really awake. He said
[52:44] their their subconscious and
[52:46] consciousness is mixed. He said the
[52:48] subconscious is down here. He said
[52:49] that's actually the steam room in the
[52:51] locomotive. That's what actually drives
[52:53] you. He said the man up here. He said
[52:55] the conscious don't really drive you. He
[52:56] said it's the subconscious. He said it's
[52:58] the subconscious that I'm trying to
[52:59] contact. That's what I'm trying to get
[53:02] to. Cuz if you get to the subconscious,
[53:04] it will override the conscious. It'll
[53:06] make you the devil is so sly when you
[53:08] start saying words like that. If you
[53:10] ain't careful, he hits that
[53:12] subconscious. When you do, he done
[53:14] conceived you of a lie and that that
[53:15] that lie is done come in and it's
[53:17] conceived. It's going to give birth. And
[53:19] when it does, it's doubt. And when you
[53:21] don't believe the word just because of
[53:22] one slide of a man, I I've met people
[53:26] Well, I believe it.
[53:28] And it's like they just floating on a
[53:30] cloud, right? Yeah. Like nothing else in
[53:31] the world matters. And that uh that's
[53:33] it. That's all they got to do. Man,
[53:35] don't you realize that Christianity is
[53:37] not a bad ease? God said before he had
[53:40] to go preach marriage and divorce. He
[53:41] said if he said man run from presence of
[53:43] God. He said if you're floating down the
[53:45] stream I like to go kaying a whole lot.
[53:48] Love go fishing down a creek. So I can
[53:51] relate to this. When you going down a
[53:52] stream, he said and you just stop and
[53:54] you're sitting there and you're watching
[53:55] the birds and you're watching the
[53:57] butterflies. He said you ain't doing the
[53:58] will of God. He said it's when you
[54:00] roaming upstream. He said it's when you
[54:02] fight. He said when you just sitting
[54:04] there watching everything go by. You're
[54:05] sherking your responsibilities. It's
[54:07] when we fight and we press. It's not
[54:10] when we eat cookies. It ain't when we go
[54:12] to a PD. It ain't when we hear flowery
[54:14] things that make us feel good. It's when
[54:16] we press and we fight for an eagle to
[54:18] have to climb a hair. Then look, brother
[54:23] talking about Ishmael. He said Ishma was
[54:25] nothing more than a carnal believer.
[54:27] Right? We know here after
[54:29] Abraham after God come and showed him
[54:33] that pillar of
[54:35] fire right after that the next chapter
[54:38] Sarah brings Hagar to him right the very
[54:42] next chapter right I mean after this
[54:45] come has been made the supernatural he
[54:47] sees here comes Hagar and I'm sure Hagar
[54:49] we know she was already sterile excuse
[54:52] me or Baron but
[54:53] Abraham I feel like she may have thought
[54:56] he was running out of
[54:57] put it that way because it was 10 years
[54:59] finally 10 years Abraham he probably
[55:01] thought the same through and said I
[55:02] guess I will I take Hagar and it created
[55:05] Ishmael we know Ishmael was a seed of
[55:07] doubt and that seed of doubt took place
[55:10] now Abraham loved Ishmael he loved him
[55:14] he was his only son for I think I kind
[55:16] of calculated what 16 18 years something
[55:18] like that or that was when he was
[55:20] expelled I know his 13 years when he was
[55:22] circumcised but he had it for a long
[55:24] time the only son he had is blood. He
[55:27] didn't want him to go nowhere. And then
[55:29] when God when Sarah got mad at him the
[55:31] second time and to see how much God's
[55:34] hand was on Ishmael's life, it it
[55:37] confounds me because God saved God.
[55:40] Brother Ram said it was the same rot
[55:42] that came to Hagar was the same rock
[55:45] that gave the children of Israel water.
[55:47] The same rock, the same God that dropped
[55:49] down and heard the cries of Ishmael. So
[55:52] God because he said because that Ishmael
[55:55] is your seed I'll watch over him. He
[55:58] actually made in a way made a covenant
[55:59] with Ishmael as well. He did with Hagar
[56:02] said I'll multiply make him increasing
[56:03] just not a regular multitude but an
[56:05] increasing body. He's going to make him
[56:07] a powerful people 12 princes.
[56:10] But you know he says there it amazed me
[56:12] cuz you know brother Brandham points out
[56:14] shows how when it went when he when
[56:16] Abraham went to take Isaac he said me
[56:18] and the lad will return. Then he knew
[56:20] that was a type that even though God
[56:23] told him he was going to kill him, God
[56:24] knew that since he got him from a
[56:25] supernatural birth that he could raise
[56:27] him from the dead just the same. But
[56:28] when I look at Ishmael, Abraham had the
[56:31] same kind of faith. Cuz Abraham yearned
[56:34] in his heart, he actually come to God
[56:35] said, "God, you know, basically just to
[56:37] dramatize this guy Sarah's going to kick
[56:39] him out again. He been persecuting. He
[56:42] been persecuting Isaac and she's mad and
[56:44] wants him out of here. I don't want
[56:45] Ishmael to go. That's my oldest son."
[56:48] God said, "That's all right. I'm going
[56:50] to take care of him cuz he's thy seed.
[56:53] He said because he's thy seed, I'm going
[56:55] to take care of him. He said, "But it
[56:57] will not be out of that lineage." He
[56:59] said, "But it'll be through Isaac that
[57:00] your seed shall be caught." There's a
[57:02] big difference there, and we all know
[57:03] that. But here's that seed of
[57:06] Ishmael. He sends him out to the desert.
[57:09] Gives him one bottle of water. One
[57:11] bottle of water. One. You tell me for
[57:14] one minute. Abraham year painful. so
[57:18] painful that God actually comes down and
[57:20] talks to him directly to ease his pain,
[57:23] to tell him he's going to take care of
[57:24] him and actually give Ishmael a type of
[57:26] a covenant. Abraham knew that God was
[57:28] going to take care of him. Yeah. Just
[57:30] like he knew he was going to take care
[57:31] of Isaac. If not, he' gave him a whole
[57:33] camel full of water. He gave him one
[57:35] bottle of water and then God he
[57:38] sustained him. He had faith in God. He
[57:40] knew he was going to take care of him
[57:41] cuz God told him he would. Well, here's
[57:43] Ishmael out there.
[57:47] The Bible puts it in such a way when the
[57:49] angel comes to Hagar a second time, he
[57:50] says, you know, he'll make him a mighty
[57:52] nation. He said, but his hand will be
[57:56] against every man. Now, he laid it out
[57:59] in that platform in that scenario. He
[58:02] didn't say every man's hand will be
[58:04] against him and his against every. He
[58:06] said his hand will be against every man.
[58:08] And I'll tell you something, we got a
[58:10] whole lot of ismos running around. Hey,
[58:14] cuz see brother, the Bible says that he
[58:17] will dwell with his brethren. Who is his
[58:19] brethren? Isaac. That's who his brother
[58:21] was. They had the same day. He will
[58:24] dwell with his brethren and become a
[58:26] mighty nation.
[58:28] We got a bunch of Ishmails running
[58:30] around shooting bows and archers at one
[58:33] another. Hey, you see it all time. You
[58:35] let somebody watch something on the
[58:37] internet. I don't agree with that.
[58:40] 7.
[58:42] Yeah. Hey, you done shot a boat. You
[58:45] preach a sermon, you walk outside,
[58:47] brother, that ain't right. The reason I
[58:48] ain't right cuz brother B say they shot
[58:51] another air. Hey, you say was there
[58:54] something? Look, I know brother Bham
[58:56] said. He said if you hear me say
[58:59] something wrong, you're obligated to
[59:01] come and tell me. But see, there's a
[59:04] difference between you telling them and
[59:06] God telling. If you come, it depends on
[59:08] what your ambition, what's your motives,
[59:10] your objectives. Now, it's published up.
[59:12] The Bible says a sudden to show thyself
[59:14] approved unto God, not unto man. I don't
[59:17] care how much you know. I'm just going
[59:19] to let you know. I want to see how much
[59:21] you can live. That's what I want to see.
[59:22] I don't care how much you know. I see
[59:25] tell you all kinds of opinions. I tell
[59:26] you all kinds of traditions, doctrines.
[59:29] I tell you my ideas about all kinds of
[59:31] stuff. But that don't matter. I want to
[59:33] see how you live. Cuz if no proof,
[59:35] they'll prove who you are, you got
[59:37] nothing. Cuz truth is absolute. So when
[59:40] you come up, when God creates an
[59:43] atmosphere, correction can abide in
[59:45] love. When God creates the atmosphere,
[59:48] when man creates the atmosphere, it's
[59:50] just strife, it's murder. And if you
[59:53] ain't careful and both of you got the
[59:55] wrong spirit, you going get in a fight.
[59:57] That's right. You don't get in an
[59:58] argument. You don't get in a debate. But
[1:00:01] the thing is, one of you may actually
[1:00:02] have the Holy Ghost. Uh-oh. Actually,
[1:00:05] one of you may have the Holy Ghost. So,
[1:00:07] a bad atmosphere gets actually quenched
[1:00:10] by the Holy Ghost. That brother can take
[1:00:12] him. Well, brother, that's all right.
[1:00:13] Just pray for me. I love you. I I need
[1:00:16] all the help I can get. You know, that's
[1:00:17] right. But when you see brothers
[1:00:19] attacking one another over doctrine,
[1:00:23] blessing, you don't never see nobody
[1:00:25] fuss over, brother so and so got healed.
[1:00:29] Well, I don't like that. I don't like
[1:00:30] that at all. I wish I'd been over there
[1:00:32] and
[1:00:33] he so and so got saved, got filled with
[1:00:35] the Holy Ghost. Well, I just don't agree
[1:00:37] with that. I don't agree with that at
[1:00:38] all. Which I know, brother Brown said,
[1:00:40] it's only the word that brings
[1:00:41] separation. It's the word that always
[1:00:43] brings separation, but it's not Christ
[1:00:46] don't separate himself from others. It's
[1:00:49] disbelief that separates himself from
[1:00:50] Christ. It's darkness that flees from
[1:00:52] light. So if you walk around running
[1:00:54] about everybody off from you because
[1:00:57] what's coming out of your mouth, I don't
[1:00:59] care if it's 100% true. Guess what? That
[1:01:02] ain't God. That ain't the Holy Ghost.
[1:01:05] Now if your life, what you walking and
[1:01:07] what you living and your love and
[1:01:09] everything and that's running people
[1:01:10] off, we can't help it. That's being
[1:01:13] persecuted for the word's sake. God
[1:01:15] said, you know, the blessings you'll
[1:01:17] receive off of it. You know, he said,
[1:01:19] you know, if they do me that way, how
[1:01:21] are they going to do you, the master of
[1:01:22] the house? That's right. So, we got a
[1:01:25] lot of isshails running around. The
[1:01:26] thing is, and brother home preaches at
[1:01:28] home a lot of times. I've heard him
[1:01:30] before mention it. You know, brother
[1:01:32] Brandham, and I know brother heard, you
[1:01:33] know, said there's, it's always stuck
[1:01:35] out to me when I first heard it, but
[1:01:36] there's three types of believers in all
[1:01:37] services. Oh my. You know, brother
[1:01:39] Brandon, brother home, bring it on down.
[1:01:40] He said there's actually three types of
[1:01:42] believer in you cuz you are the church.
[1:01:45] Right? So, I'm going to kind of go off
[1:01:47] of that for a minute because it's so
[1:01:49] true. This flesh man is an unbeliever.
[1:01:51] This spiritual man, it's a make
[1:01:53] believer. It wants to believe, but the
[1:01:55] inside man is either a believer or an
[1:01:57] unbeliever. So, you got all which if
[1:01:59] you're a child of God, you got a
[1:02:01] believer, an unbeliever, and a make
[1:02:02] believe all in the same body right here.
[1:02:04] But see, the thing is, I better watch it
[1:02:07] cuz if I'm being motivated or influenced
[1:02:10] by the wrong spirit, I may just be
[1:02:12] playing the part of an Ishmael. I be a
[1:02:14] born again child of God. But when this
[1:02:16] carnal man, if I don't yield, if I've
[1:02:19] had a bad day, or if I ain't been in the
[1:02:21] presence of God, or if I've been just
[1:02:23] slack and I get influenced, if I ain't
[1:02:25] careful, I shoot a bow. And then when I
[1:02:28] do, but see, the difference is when a
[1:02:30] seed of God shoots a bow. Oh my. Oh,
[1:02:33] that's right. Oh, God. Right. And he's
[1:02:36] going to he ain't going to be able to
[1:02:38] hardly do nothing until he talks to that
[1:02:40] brother. He's going to have to tell that
[1:02:42] brother, I shouldn't have said that. You
[1:02:44] know, he's going to break it down and
[1:02:46] he's going to apologize and he's going
[1:02:48] to make things right. But if we ain't
[1:02:50] careful, I play the part of an issue.
[1:02:52] I've been guilty of it. Hey, this all
[1:02:54] relates to me just as much as it does to
[1:02:56] anybody. I'm preaching to myself because
[1:02:59] I want to walk in the way that God He
[1:03:02] wants me to walk. I see some faults in
[1:03:04] me that God allows me to see and I want
[1:03:07] them to be corrected. So, you know, just
[1:03:09] because we do play the part of Ishmael,
[1:03:11] sometimes, you know, we going to leave
[1:03:13] this brochure, this past house, you
[1:03:16] know, it ain't never going to be
[1:03:16] redeemed. Uh, it's just this man on the
[1:03:19] inside. So, we got on this thing until
[1:03:21] we get out of here. But the great thing
[1:03:22] is of his redemption power. It's the
[1:03:25] blood that God gives us that we can
[1:03:28] actually meet up under, right? And
[1:03:30] that's the only place. It is the only
[1:03:32] place. It is the absolute. Brother said
[1:03:35] that the blood is an absolute. and take
[1:03:37] this definition here. This actually
[1:03:39] brother Brown now I was hearing a man
[1:03:40] speak or talking not long ago he used
[1:03:42] the word absolute and I thought that's a
[1:03:44] very fine word to hear somebody use
[1:03:46] absolute comes down he said and it's an
[1:03:50] ultimate wester is perfect in itself
[1:03:52] unlimited in its power primarily an
[1:03:56] ultimate an ultimate is the amen the
[1:03:59] blood itself is an amen now we know that
[1:04:03] the word is the bleeding is the bleeding
[1:04:05] word of God now it's not that this Bible
[1:04:08] is bleeding. This
[1:04:10] Bible is just sitting here just fine.
[1:04:13] It's not that the letter if it was the
[1:04:15] letter or the tradition or it's the
[1:04:17] dogmas or whatever we can actually learn
[1:04:18] absorb into our brain. If that was a
[1:04:21] place that God gave us fellowship, then
[1:04:25] we would all have fellowship. Come on.
[1:04:27] There would not be three types of
[1:04:28] believers period. I mean true actually
[1:04:30] three types of believers. We would all
[1:04:32] be under a robe of fellowship. We'd be
[1:04:34] all up under that blood bumper. But the
[1:04:36] thing is it's right back to what Cain
[1:04:39] and Abel. It's right back to when when
[1:04:41] the log gods came and he came to Abraham
[1:04:42] and it made this covenant. The bleeding
[1:04:45] word is an actual sp true true
[1:04:48] uh happen to where the person a lot of
[1:04:52] times it you know sometime I told this
[1:04:55] guy at work I wish I could just take off
[1:04:56] my my brain or my heart and set it right
[1:05:00] here and let you just jack into it and
[1:05:02] just get cuz I can't give it the way I
[1:05:04] want to give it you know but you sit
[1:05:06] here
[1:05:08] and this word comes along and when it
[1:05:11] does it's not just a word it's not
[1:05:13] understanding. It's the actual logos.
[1:05:17] It's actually God himself coming to you
[1:05:21] and opening up himself. He's showing you
[1:05:23] who he is. And I don't mean
[1:05:27] blessing. What do we expect out of God?
[1:05:30] Do we expect God's blood sacrifice to be
[1:05:32] a doctrine? Do we expect it to be a
[1:05:34] lifestyle? Do we expect it something
[1:05:36] just to just walk us through until we
[1:05:38] get out of here and die? Or do we
[1:05:40] actually expect God's blood, believe
[1:05:42] sacrifice to be a personal relationship
[1:05:45] with an actual being? I ain't talking
[1:05:48] about some spoopy some kind of clown.
[1:05:51] I'm talking about a being walking,
[1:05:54] talking with you, coming to your house
[1:05:57] and talking to you. A lot of times, you
[1:05:59] know, I feel like we need to quit
[1:06:00] reading sometimes so much. I I ain't got
[1:06:02] no problem with study. I I I love to
[1:06:05] read about God, but sometimes we need to
[1:06:07] get away and go sit on the field
[1:06:08] somewhere. Go sit down by a creek bank.
[1:06:11] Go get somewhere and just sit there and
[1:06:12] let God come and talk to you. I ain't
[1:06:15] talking about some blind spirit. I'm
[1:06:18] talking about the person Jesus Christ
[1:06:20] coming and talking to you. That is the
[1:06:23] only light. That is the only light that
[1:06:25] will flash and bring that seed to life.
[1:06:29] That seed may be there, but if it don't
[1:06:31] flash, come on. Right? It ain't going to
[1:06:34] grow. Come on, brother. And only life is
[1:06:37] the actual person of Jesus Christ. It's
[1:06:39] the love God. God is so big, brother
[1:06:42] said. He's so great, he made himself
[1:06:44] small enough that we can see. He can
[1:06:45] hide himself in a little ball of light
[1:06:47] and come to talk to you. Do you believe
[1:06:49] God can come and talk to you in a pillar
[1:06:51] of fire? I want to ask you that
[1:06:52] question. Do you believe he can actually
[1:06:54] come in your living room and drop down a
[1:06:56] pillar of fire? If you believe it and
[1:06:58] look for it, it'll happen. If you don't
[1:07:00] believe it, it won't happen. and how
[1:07:03] close of a walk with God you want. Amen.
[1:07:06] God, brother said when I come to God, it
[1:07:08] was like I went to an arcade. He said,
[1:07:10] "I've seen all the promises." He said,
[1:07:11] "And I wanted every one of them."
[1:07:14] Brother, sister, that's mine and yours,
[1:07:17] how close a relationship you want with
[1:07:19] God, however close you want it to be,
[1:07:21] that's how close God will give it. Cuz
[1:07:23] if it's the right motive and if it's the
[1:07:25] right objective and if you're sitting
[1:07:27] there and you see something and it's
[1:07:29] pulling on you and it's pulling on you
[1:07:33] and it's not out of pride, it ain't out
[1:07:35] of well I want to do this and I want to
[1:07:37] do this, I want to do that, I want to
[1:07:38] be. No, if it's God, if it's the right
[1:07:41] attitude, the right motive and it's
[1:07:43] pulling on you and it's in the word,
[1:07:46] it's yours. There's somebody there
[1:07:49] pulling on you. His name is Jesus
[1:07:51] Christ. He's putting on you trying to
[1:07:53] say this is yours. Won't you take it and
[1:07:55] live it? Walk in it. How close do you
[1:07:58] want to live to me? Do you want to live
[1:08:00] like Daniel? Do you want to live like
[1:08:02] Joseph?
[1:08:03] That's right. How close relationship do
[1:08:06] you want with God? It's here for you.
[1:08:08] People say, "Well, I can't do the things
[1:08:10] brother Brown did." Maybe not
[1:08:12] everything, but some of the things, yes,
[1:08:14] you can. God may not. No, he ain't going
[1:08:16] to come work through you as a seven
[1:08:18] church a message. That's already come
[1:08:20] and gone. But everything else, Jesus
[1:08:22] Christ is the same yesterday, day, and
[1:08:25] forever. It's the same spiritual gift.
[1:08:27] It's the same fruit of the spirit. And
[1:08:28] if God don't do the same with you, he
[1:08:31] ain't going to do. He's a liar. He is a
[1:08:33] liar. But the motive and objectives have
[1:08:36] to be right. If your motive in
[1:08:38] objectives are wrong, brother Brandon
[1:08:39] said the right motive objectives and
[1:08:41] right attitude, any promise of God bring
[1:08:42] it to pass. Come on. Right? If your
[1:08:44] acting is bad, if your motives are
[1:08:47] wrong, really you're carnal believer
[1:08:49] unless God does something to you and
[1:08:51] makes you right. But if you're a true
[1:08:53] believer, you know, brother Brand said,
[1:08:54] "I'd rather have a man right in his
[1:08:55] heart and wrong his doctrine." That's
[1:08:57] right. He said, "Cuz I can do something
[1:08:58] with that man." Right. But if if if God
[1:09:01] ain't in your
[1:09:02] heart, he can't do nothing with you. And
[1:09:05] your attitude and your objections are
[1:09:07] always going to be bad. I was telling
[1:09:09] brother Gam on the way up
[1:09:11] here, you know, which I ain't, you know,
[1:09:15] I I've not been preaching long at all.
[1:09:18] And last time I went and preached, it's
[1:09:20] actually been about 6 months since I
[1:09:21] have preached. And then last time I
[1:09:23] preached before then, I had to go preach
[1:09:24] at a youth
[1:09:25] camp. And I was so scared. I was so
[1:09:30] nervous because you know whenever I sit
[1:09:33] down and I think of what I told I told
[1:09:36] the G I said right before then brother
[1:09:38] Josh Bennett comes over and he preaches
[1:09:39] at our church and I think Lord have
[1:09:42] mercy I said I can't do that you know
[1:09:44] there ain't no way you know I I can't do
[1:09:46] that you know really that's right and I
[1:09:49] was so scared and I was walking down the
[1:09:51] street on my lunch break and I was I
[1:09:53] said God I can't do this I can't do it
[1:09:56] but you know and God pushes on you to do
[1:09:58] something. You know, when God lays
[1:10:00] something on your heart to do something,
[1:10:02] he wants you to go do it. But then
[1:10:03] again, are you going to step out in
[1:10:05] faith and do it? I'm sitting here
[1:10:07] walking down the road and I'm literally
[1:10:08] a basket
[1:10:10] case and the Lord lays on my heart to
[1:10:12] listen to and I couldn't remember even
[1:10:14] what it was at that time. I never could
[1:10:16] even remember what was on the sermon,
[1:10:18] but perfect strength through perfect
[1:10:19] weakness. And when I listen to that,
[1:10:21] brother Brandham, he says, you know, the
[1:10:23] problem with a lot of you preachers, he
[1:10:24] says, you know, you think you can
[1:10:26] preach. He says, "When you get to a
[1:10:28] place where you think you can do
[1:10:29] something," he said, "God drops you
[1:10:31] right there." He said, "God can't use
[1:10:33] you." He said, "You take a man that
[1:10:35] wants to preach and wants to get up
[1:10:36] there and do this and that for God, God
[1:10:38] can't use the man." Because when he
[1:10:40] does, he going to put it on his own
[1:10:42] doctrines. He going to put his own
[1:10:43] ideas. He going to do it for money. He's
[1:10:45] going to do it for popularity. And I'll
[1:10:47] tell you something, anybody, anybody
[1:10:49] that preaches unadulterated word of God,
[1:10:51] you can ask Brother Sam, "Yo, mister, it
[1:10:54] ain't fun. It's going to be a life of
[1:10:56] trouble, pain, sorrow, agony, grief.
[1:11:00] Why? Because you're going to be hated.
[1:11:02] Come on. There's going to be a certain
[1:11:04] amount is going to love you. And that's
[1:11:06] going to make it all worth the while
[1:11:08] other than the fact that you love God so
[1:11:10] much that you rather sacrifice your
[1:11:12] life's ambitions to do what he tells you
[1:11:14] to do. But other than that, it ain't
[1:11:16] going to get you no money. And if it
[1:11:17] does, if God does bless you with some
[1:11:19] money, everybody going to talk about
[1:11:20] you.
[1:11:22] So many of you do actually preach the
[1:11:23] unadulterated word of God. And I'm more
[1:11:25] concerned. I'm more con convinced that
[1:11:29] people don't no more want this message
[1:11:30] preached most time than anything. They
[1:11:33] don't want to hear it. They want a
[1:11:35] religion. They want a lifestyle. And as
[1:11:37] long as you don't touch their lifestyle,
[1:11:40] they happy. They happy. Talking about
[1:11:43] subconsciousness. You know, when you
[1:11:45] actually look at a TV, when you look at
[1:11:47] a TV, it throws your mind to a beta
[1:11:50] wave. And it goes from an alpha wave to
[1:11:52] a beta wave. And depending on how much
[1:11:53] you look at a TV, it actually trans the
[1:11:56] transition is faster. If you look at one
[1:11:59] of my bam, beta wave. A beta wave is
[1:12:01] close thing to a dream state with you
[1:12:03] being with your eyes open. So you're
[1:12:05] sitting there whileever you're watching,
[1:12:07] you're digesting into your subconscious
[1:12:09] mind. Do you realize how slick brother
[1:12:13] says then Satan done fooled you? He said
[1:12:16] you done quit going to the movie
[1:12:18] theater. to slip it into your house. Now
[1:12:20] you got people with DVD players that's
[1:12:23] got PR guardian on
[1:12:25] it just cuz it don't cuss. It's okay. I
[1:12:28] can't hear the cuss words. Well, let me
[1:12:30] tell you
[1:12:31] something. Is there a bohaired woman in
[1:12:33] in that movie? Yeah. Is there women? Is
[1:12:36] there a Jezebel painted up woman in that
[1:12:38] movie? I want to know because if it is,
[1:12:42] you said, "Well, it don't bother me."
[1:12:44] Cuz see that spirit's in your house.
[1:12:46] Once you turn it on, there's spirits in
[1:12:48] your house. Brother Brandon said he
[1:12:50] liked to go to church and preach because
[1:12:52] when he went to the big uh gymnasiums,
[1:12:55] he said there are spirits hanging
[1:12:56] around. They they stay in there from
[1:12:58] after the boxing matches and stuff. So
[1:13:00] when you sit there and your wife said,
[1:13:02] you know, release that spirit in your
[1:13:04] house, say, "Well, I'm 60 years old. It
[1:13:06] don't really bother me none. You know,
[1:13:08] I'm not ever going to cut my hair." How
[1:13:09] about your granddaughter? When your
[1:13:11] granddaughter comes to visit, she sits
[1:13:12] in that room. For some no reason, when
[1:13:14] she's 8 years old, she starts thinking
[1:13:15] about want to cut her hair.
[1:13:18] You know why? Cuz that spirit sitting in
[1:13:20] that room, she starts thinking about,
[1:13:21] "Huh, I want to wear some lipstick." It
[1:13:24] might have been because the movie you
[1:13:25] watched there a week ago and you never
[1:13:27] had some Jezebel walking around that TV
[1:13:29] screen that's released right there in
[1:13:30] your living room and she's going to sit
[1:13:32] there and fight a battle. And I can't
[1:13:34] imagine how hard of a battle that would
[1:13:35] be for a little girl growing up and not
[1:13:38] even the people to sit there and let
[1:13:40] them watch it. Woman running around.
[1:13:42] Well, there ain't no bed scenes and they
[1:13:44] ain't hardly no cussing in here and they
[1:13:46] don't kiss really but one time.
[1:13:49] Are the people kissing married? Are they
[1:13:52] married? If not, now you got a spirit of
[1:13:54] fornication and adultery sitting in your
[1:13:56] living room. Say, I don't believe that,
[1:13:58] brother J. Well, well, like I said, it's
[1:14:01] the truth. He know you, brother Brandon,
[1:14:04] he taught the very same thing. It's the
[1:14:06] truth. It's there. has spirits there and
[1:14:09] your little girl, your little
[1:14:10] granddaughter, whoever comes over, they
[1:14:12] may not can handle that demon like you
[1:14:15] can. He may can watch you not bother you
[1:14:17] at all. But then it's a battle for them.
[1:14:21] It's like I say, you know, most time the
[1:14:24] devil, he is so sly, it's just like the
[1:14:27] play on words. If he can get to your
[1:14:29] subconscious mind, he knows, brother
[1:14:32] even pointed out. He knows how powerful
[1:14:34] the subconscious mind is. And if Satan
[1:14:36] can get that subconscious mind, he's got
[1:14:39] you in a place. He's got you in a place
[1:14:41] where he can manipulate you. He got you
[1:14:43] in a place where he can put things in
[1:14:45] your mind that really at the time when
[1:14:47] it's going on, you can't fight it. You
[1:14:49] have no defense against it. You You
[1:14:51] can't sit there and try to whack it away
[1:14:54] because you can't see it coming. Right?
[1:14:58] Let's look back
[1:15:01] here. Come back here to Abraham.
[1:15:06] Brother Brown says here he says, "Now
[1:15:08] notice what he did. Oh, it's marvelous.
[1:15:11] He kept the birds off until the sun went
[1:15:14] down." Right? Now, that's relating back
[1:15:16] to Genesis. All you know, anybody don't
[1:15:18] understand. Going back to Genesis, he
[1:15:19] actually made a covenant after he
[1:15:20] actually tore apart the animals like God
[1:15:22] told him to. He came apart. He separated
[1:15:24] them. He pulled them out and he laid
[1:15:26] them on the rock. He sat there and he
[1:15:28] fought them. He kept the birds off of
[1:15:29] them so they won't go they wouldn't
[1:15:31] actually go and mess up the animals
[1:15:33] there to sacrifice. He said, "Oh, it's
[1:15:35] tomorrow." He kept the birds off until
[1:15:36] the sun went down. Notice then a deep
[1:15:39] sleep fell on Abraham. First thing,
[1:15:42] Abraham, I'm just going to shut you off.
[1:15:46] I love this. First thing, Abraham, I'm
[1:15:49] just going to shut you off to show you
[1:15:51] there's not one thing you can do about
[1:15:53] it. Amen. He just laid him down to
[1:15:55] sleep. Brother said he done that as a
[1:15:56] sign to show there ain't nothing you can
[1:15:58] do. There ain't nothing you can do to
[1:16:00] get this. There ain't nothing you can do
[1:16:01] to keep from getting it. I'm going to
[1:16:03] shut you down and you going to watch
[1:16:04] this take place. He said after and it
[1:16:07] was
[1:16:08] done. This is my covenant. And it wasn't
[1:16:11] one thing, brother, that you could do
[1:16:13] about it. It isn't one thing, sister,
[1:16:14] that you've done about it. It's what God
[1:16:16] did for you in Christ. Not because you
[1:16:18] was good. Not because a mother was good,
[1:16:21] but what Christ was good. That's right.
[1:16:24] and what Christ did by calling you. That
[1:16:27] is the actual blood sacrifice again.
[1:16:29] It's the logos coming and it's actually
[1:16:32] saying, "Hey,
[1:16:33] Jeremy, come on." It starts pulling on
[1:16:36] me. It starts showing me light to walk
[1:16:38] into. I've been doing some I did some
[1:16:41] research on the Muslims and I was very,
[1:16:44] very astounded by what I
[1:16:47] found. You got different, you know,
[1:16:50] Muslims, the Muslims now, you know,
[1:16:52] brother B actually makes comments. He
[1:16:53] said, "Now everything in it perfect
[1:16:55] setting." He said, "You know, you got
[1:16:56] Isaac descend. You got Ismail send. You
[1:16:58] got the Jews sitting there in a promised
[1:16:59] land fighting one another's neck." He
[1:17:01] said, "It's continued over." It's the
[1:17:02] same thing going on, right?
[1:17:05] Well, you look, if that's the case,
[1:17:07] which we know the Bible's true, we know
[1:17:09] Brother was showing was true. We know
[1:17:10] that's the seed chapter. Well, now we
[1:17:12] got Muslims. That is the mighty nation
[1:17:14] of Ishmael. That is the mighty nation
[1:17:17] that God promised. He cut that nation
[1:17:19] alive. Right. Sure. Abraham had enough
[1:17:22] faith that he gave her one bottle of
[1:17:24] water that God was going to keep that
[1:17:27] nation alive. Now Islams or the Muslims
[1:17:31] are just
[1:17:33] like Christians in one sense that they
[1:17:36] got different
[1:17:37] denominations. Now Muhammad taught
[1:17:39] against denominations just like the
[1:17:41] Bible does. Right? He taught that it was
[1:17:44] of
[1:17:45] Satan, but those you got to shoot the
[1:17:48] Shiites and the Sunnis and all and
[1:17:49] there's actually tons of denominations.
[1:17:51] But then there's a group that's actually
[1:17:53] it reminds me of us because they're
[1:17:56] walking down the middle. They actually
[1:17:58] take the Quran at face value and they
[1:18:00] rest upon things that Muslim that that
[1:18:02] Muhammad teaches in the Quran and they
[1:18:04] actually walk down this road. And when
[1:18:07] they do, the only Muslims have to
[1:18:10] believe in Abraham. They have to believe
[1:18:12] in Noah. They have to believe in Moses
[1:18:15] and they have to believe that Mary was
[1:18:17] the virgin mother of
[1:18:19] God of Jesus Christ or not God of Jesus
[1:18:22] Christ. Right? They don't believe he was
[1:18:24] actually God reincarnated. They believe
[1:18:27] he was a prophet, but that was of a
[1:18:29] virgin birth. Oh yeah. They don't
[1:18:31] believe he was crucified. But they
[1:18:34] actually believe that Jesus Christ is
[1:18:36] the Messiah that's going to come back in
[1:18:39] the end time.
[1:18:41] But the difference is they don't believe
[1:18:43] in the sh and the shed blood. They don't
[1:18:46] believe in the cross. But the sc one of
[1:18:48] the scariest things about it to
[1:18:50] me the actual one some of them believe
[1:18:53] that Muhammad's coming back to fight a
[1:18:56] battle to present Jesus Christ to the
[1:18:59] world and others believe that it's
[1:19:01] actually going to be the 12th descendant
[1:19:04] of Muhammad that's going to come back
[1:19:06] and wage this war. And I heard brother
[1:19:09] Mick comment one time that just slap me
[1:19:12] in the face of sobriety. He said, "For
[1:19:14] 2,000 years, people have looking for the
[1:19:16] return of Jesus Christ." He said, "Now,
[1:19:19] people are looking for the return of
[1:19:20] William Brown to show you how close the
[1:19:23] spiritual touch the flesh carnal
[1:19:25] believer, they believe almost the exact
[1:19:29] same thing. The only thing that they
[1:19:31] take out is the shed blood of Jesus
[1:19:34] Christ. It's not when the Muslims come
[1:19:37] and they took over Jerusalem. After
[1:19:39] Jerusalem fell, they built the the the
[1:19:41] mosque there. They went throughout all
[1:19:43] the
[1:19:44] world collecting
[1:19:47] books, collecting books of medical,
[1:19:50] architectural, science. They went
[1:19:52] collected all these books and brought
[1:19:53] back and made a library that was
[1:19:55] actually doing cataract surgeries and
[1:19:57] all kinds of stuff way back
[1:19:59] then. I just remind it reminds me of
[1:20:03] that old Hulk that jumped around that
[1:20:05] corner believer. He didn't figure out
[1:20:07] none of that on his own. He let somebody
[1:20:09] else kiss. He let somebody else learn
[1:20:11] all about that knowledge and he just
[1:20:13] went and gathered it up and ate all of
[1:20:15] it. He made a name for himself, made a
[1:20:17] nomination, made a place where he could
[1:20:18] stand and sit there and preach and gain
[1:20:20] prestige and take money into himself. He
[1:20:23] made himself a powerful empire of what
[1:20:25] somebody else killed, of what somebody
[1:20:28] else doing instead of flying down and
[1:20:31] letting
[1:20:32] God show him. Abraham after God made
[1:20:36] that covenant with
[1:20:38] him, Sarah them, they got tired of
[1:20:41] waiting. So many times there's things
[1:20:43] that I don't
[1:20:45] understand. I don't understand about the
[1:20:48] Bible. They don't understand, brother.
[1:20:50] Say
[1:20:51] it. I got to wait. If I don't wait, I'll
[1:20:56] make up my own idea. I'll make up my own
[1:20:59] opinion and my own tradition. And when I
[1:21:02] do, I create doubt. And that tradition
[1:21:05] burst in Ishmamail. And if I ain't
[1:21:07] careful, if my heart ain't right, God
[1:21:09] won't come kill that thing. You got to
[1:21:11] kill it. Cuz once you go around shooting
[1:21:12] everybody with it, you got to go make it
[1:21:15] right. And if you ain't careful when you
[1:21:17] waiting on a revelation from God, just
[1:21:19] wait. He will come and show it to you.
[1:21:22] It may be five years, right? But don't
[1:21:25] talk about it. Why talk about something
[1:21:28] you don't know? Don't be like that Hulk
[1:21:31] flying around cuz if God don't show it
[1:21:33] to you then it's something that you
[1:21:35] killed. That eagle represents the Holy
[1:21:38] Ghost. It don't represent you. It
[1:21:40] represents the Holy Ghost in you. It
[1:21:42] ain't a holy prophet. It's a holy God in
[1:21:44] a prophet. And if you got the Holy
[1:21:46] Ghost, it's the same spirit that was in
[1:21:48] the prophets. It represents the Holy
[1:21:50] Ghost coming and laying down that fresh
[1:21:54] food for you. Right. I'll prepare a meal
[1:21:59] for you in the face of your enemies. We
[1:22:01] fight every single day just to believe.
[1:22:05] We fight just to walk what God has
[1:22:07] showed us. We fight every single day.
[1:22:10] But God said if you'll wait upon the
[1:22:11] Lord,
[1:22:14] he will come and he'll bring that great
[1:22:17] eagle will come later right there. But
[1:22:19] where's the
[1:22:21] fighting? Is surrendering and is holding
[1:22:23] on. blood said that that Israel made
[1:22:26] their mistake when they spurned grace
[1:22:28] for law. He said Israel always wanted to
[1:22:30] do something. They always wanted to get
[1:22:32] their hands in it. They wanted a king.
[1:22:35] They wanted to do something, ask God, do
[1:22:37] something for God. God called us to be a
[1:22:39] bride. He called us to be under him. He
[1:22:42] gave us the Holy Ghost, which is the
[1:22:44] Sabbath, which is a rest. We're to sit
[1:22:47] and wait on God to bring it. And when he
[1:22:49] brings in this time, all we got to do is
[1:22:51] believe it. when he comes and brings it,
[1:22:54] we understand it. Just walk in it.
[1:22:56] That's all it is. It's just to walk in
[1:22:59] it. Right. When he sit here in
[1:23:02] Abraham when he went into that deep
[1:23:04] sleep, cuz I'm going tell
[1:23:06] you, I can't do nothing. I can't figure
[1:23:10] it out, right? I I cannot do it, right?
[1:23:14] But if I rest,
[1:23:16] that's it. It's been proven to me. I can
[1:23:19] go get
[1:23:20] tapes. I can get teaching tapes.
[1:23:24] I've tried it. I've tried to do all
[1:23:26] kinds of stuff. But one thing I've
[1:23:28] learned is a lot of times you just
[1:23:30] getting somebody's opinion anyhow.
[1:23:32] That's right. And I sit there and I
[1:23:34] absorb it in and then but if I just wait
[1:23:36] now, like I said, I ain't got nothing
[1:23:38] wrong. There ain't I ain't got nothing
[1:23:39] against from reading God. It reminds me
[1:23:42] God had me studying in a subject not
[1:23:45] long ago. I said, God, why in the world
[1:23:46] am I looking at this? Why? I would say
[1:23:49] everything I was looking at it was
[1:23:50] taking me right back to the word. I
[1:23:52] said, "God, why am I looking at this?"
[1:23:54] And as I sat out there talking to him,
[1:23:57] you know, he said, "I'm filling it up."
[1:24:01] And it come so plain. This bottle, yeah,
[1:24:06] it can't put water in itself. He can't
[1:24:08] ask for water to be put in it. It don't
[1:24:11] matter what it does. It's a bottle. It's
[1:24:13] a vessel. Somebody of a divine nature,
[1:24:17] somebody in a higher state of being has
[1:24:19] to come and put water in this bottle.
[1:24:21] And then when the water's in the bottle,
[1:24:23] it can't say, "Well, I want Coke." It
[1:24:25] ain't got a choice. Yeah. It takes
[1:24:28] whatever you put in that vessel. That
[1:24:31] vessel don't know how to pour it into a
[1:24:32] glass. He don't know how to pour it into
[1:24:34] your mouth. It don't know how to do
[1:24:36] nothing. All that vessel knows how to do
[1:24:38] is that just sit there. It takes a
[1:24:40] divine higher being to do anything.
[1:24:43] what's with the vessel whether to put
[1:24:45] something in it to pour it out or whatn
[1:24:46] not. So when you sit there God he's
[1:24:50] obligated he's promised to come it's
[1:24:53] just it's so it's my heart is so heavy
[1:24:57] for the simple fact that I see people so
[1:25:00] much that I know have never truly had an
[1:25:05] experience with God. Oh my right. That's
[1:25:08] right. And then God truly, he wants to
[1:25:11] be your best friend, right? Just as AB
[1:25:16] Abraham walked, he was I looked up the
[1:25:19] name Hebrew the other day, about two
[1:25:21] months ago. I say the other day, about
[1:25:22] two months ago, it means one from
[1:25:25] beyond. I thought, man, if I ain't a
[1:25:27] Hebrew, I don't know what I am. Called
[1:25:29] Abraham the one from beyond. From beyond
[1:25:32] where? Beyond the curtain of time. Yeah.
[1:25:35] They come and drop down and God had to
[1:25:37] manifest himself for me. That's right.
[1:25:39] That's right. But I see, you know, God,
[1:25:42] he actually, he so much wants to come.
[1:25:44] That's right. And walk us Amen. through
[1:25:47] this life,
[1:25:49] looking for a city whose maker is not
[1:25:52] man. The better maker is God. It's
[1:25:54] somebody that is actually having hope in
[1:25:57] what we don't see. Yeah. When I sit and
[1:26:00] I look at this world and the galaxy that
[1:26:02] we live in and I look even beyond
[1:26:05] that, for a person to actually really
[1:26:07] think logically that there is no God, it
[1:26:10] really there's something wrong with
[1:26:13] there's something wrong with but to
[1:26:15] think that that God actually come down
[1:26:17] here
[1:26:19] and calls me and wants to walk with me.
[1:26:23] He don't want
[1:26:25] He ain't calling me
[1:26:29] for church on Sunday. He ain't calling
[1:26:33] me for church on Wednesday. That's
[1:26:34] right. He ain't calling me to go out and
[1:26:37] to tell everybody how wrong they are.
[1:26:40] Come on, brother. He wants to be my
[1:26:43] lover. He wants to be your friend. He
[1:26:47] actually wants to come and talk to you.
[1:26:49] Right? I'm talking about the master of
[1:26:52] the universe wants to actually come and
[1:26:54] talk to you and walk with you and to
[1:26:57] show you. That's right. Cuz see, a lot
[1:26:59] of times, you know, Jesus died on the
[1:27:02] cross for our sins. We know that. We
[1:27:04] know that. But sometimes that's just
[1:27:05] such a it's just a story. I mean, I'm
[1:27:08] just sorry. A lot of times you hear so
[1:27:10] much, we get so gospel hardened. We get
[1:27:12] so we hear things so much that it's just
[1:27:15] a story. Well, it's a man that died for
[1:27:17] our sins.
[1:27:18] It goes so much more deeper than that.
[1:27:22] When we looking at That's right.
[1:27:25] When you actually look at science and
[1:27:26] its basics, you see God everywhere.
[1:27:30] Light and darkness in this galaxy, you
[1:27:32] got a you got a black hole that sits
[1:27:34] beneath the sun that actually eats
[1:27:36] light. It eats everything. But here's
[1:27:40] light that God chose to actually
[1:27:43] manifest himself in, right? In every
[1:27:46] form or fashion. When you look at the
[1:27:48] basics of science, whether it's energy,
[1:27:50] vibrations, light, or whatnot, God is
[1:27:52] there. Right. Right. And we
[1:27:55] see, and here's brother Brandham. He's
[1:27:58] talking about the the spilled blood, the
[1:28:00] innocent blood of God being the only
[1:28:03] fellowship. Brother Brandham tells that
[1:28:05] Abraham, he said even in the garden, he
[1:28:07] said that was God's first form. Then he
[1:28:10] says over here, Abraham even worshiped
[1:28:12] by spilled
[1:28:14] blood. when he torn him apart and that
[1:28:17] pillar of fire came through. See, it's
[1:28:19] so important to me because when I look
[1:28:22] at the Muslims, I look at the Jews, I
[1:28:26] look at the Christians, cuz I'm going to
[1:28:27] tell you something. I'll be just
[1:28:28] straight honest with you. If I didn't
[1:28:30] know how the Holy Ghost, right? And I
[1:28:33] seen the things I have seen over the
[1:28:35] last few months about a Muslim belief,
[1:28:37] right?
[1:28:38] Hey, I tell this stuff to to go as far
[1:28:42] as Christian denomination. I'll just be
[1:28:44] honest with you because them people are
[1:28:46] more real. And I'll tell you something.
[1:28:48] I challenge you to look at some of the
[1:28:49] things they actually teach cuz they
[1:28:51] profess. They profess that they know
[1:28:53] they are not the spiritual seed of
[1:28:55] Abraham, but they are the carnal seed of
[1:28:57] Abraham. They are the technological, the
[1:28:59] scientific. They are that strain of
[1:29:01] Abraham that's actually going to reunite
[1:29:03] again with Jesus Christ when he comes
[1:29:05] back and he's going to usher them in to
[1:29:07] the millennium. They believe that. Okay.
[1:29:10] But they even know enough. When you
[1:29:11] actually look at the things they
[1:29:12] actually teach about the end time, it
[1:29:14] will blow your mind. It lines up so
[1:29:17] closely with the things that brother
[1:29:18] Brown taught. The seventh church age
[1:29:20] messenger, the angel of the Lord that
[1:29:22] come and taught us spiritually. You take
[1:29:24] the spiritual happenings and tie them
[1:29:26] with the physical happenings and what
[1:29:27] they teach, it will scare you to death.
[1:29:29] You'll see that it's
[1:29:31] almost God promised them that he'd take
[1:29:34] care of them. He promised Abraham that's
[1:29:37] your seed and I'll take care of them.
[1:29:39] They'll be a mighty nation. But when I
[1:29:42] look, but where is God's seed called
[1:29:45] from? And we see that brother, he he
[1:29:48] explained to us when God said, "Let
[1:29:50] there be light." He said, "That's when
[1:29:51] that's when that logos came out. That's
[1:29:53] when Jesus come out." That's when he
[1:29:55] come out in a form that man could first
[1:29:56] actually identify. And that's super
[1:29:58] special to me because that's the origin
[1:30:01] the original. That's the first form that
[1:30:03] we could ever see God in that image in
[1:30:05] an image at all that we could actually
[1:30:07] pick up or detect with this sense of
[1:30:09] sight. When here's
[1:30:12] Abraham when he comes and makes the same
[1:30:14] covenant that he made with me, he he
[1:30:17] brings that pillar of fire right down
[1:30:19] through there. He busts him apart and
[1:30:21] there's a pillar of fire. When he comes
[1:30:23] to Moses, he has the pillar of fire.
[1:30:25] There's the pillar of fire. When he
[1:30:27] comes to Paul, he has the pillar of
[1:30:29] fire.
[1:30:30] And for me to see in this day that he
[1:30:34] come in the same form that's right of a
[1:30:37] pillar of fire
[1:30:39] again to me that makes my heart abound.
[1:30:42] I said and I sit by God at work and I
[1:30:44] talk to him and I just get so excited I
[1:30:46] forget that he's not even a believer and
[1:30:48] I start telling him all this stuff and
[1:30:51] he just looks at me kind of strange. But
[1:30:53] when you see God from the beginning
[1:30:56] until the end and you see God in the
[1:30:58] Muslims, you see him in the Jews, you
[1:31:00] see him in the nation that he called
[1:31:01] out. But then when you see him in the
[1:31:03] wild olive tree, but you see him in the
[1:31:05] same logo moving one down to another.
[1:31:07] But then when I see brother said, when
[1:31:10] he ripped Jesus Christ, he ripped his
[1:31:12] spirit from his body, ripped it apart,
[1:31:15] and it ascended on high. And then when
[1:31:17] it come back, it broke into 120 pieces
[1:31:20] and descended down on Gentiles. Right?
[1:31:23] Gentiles and Jews like it don't matter.
[1:31:26] The same logos, the one that was in the
[1:31:28] beginning is the same one that wants to
[1:31:31] come to me and you. It's the same. That
[1:31:33] is the innocent bloodshed. That is the
[1:31:36] bloodshed of the innocent one. That is
[1:31:38] the sacrifice that was made. The
[1:31:40] sacrifice is actually a covenant that
[1:31:42] was made between you and God. It's a
[1:31:44] covenant that you didn't do this. You
[1:31:46] don't deserve this, but I'm going to
[1:31:48] give it to you. Only if you'll accept
[1:31:51] it. Only if you'll accept it. Right.
[1:31:54] Wow. Right. There's no other way. Right.
[1:31:58] There's been many times when I was
[1:31:59] growing up in
[1:32:00] church. I can remember when I was 9
[1:32:02] years
[1:32:03] old coming to the altar. I was raised in
[1:32:06] Pentecostal church. My parents didn't
[1:32:09] say nothing to me about coming to the
[1:32:10] altar. I took off running just about the
[1:32:12] altar when I was 9 years old. And when I
[1:32:15] got there, I cried and I squalled and I
[1:32:17] cried. Started smoking cigarettes when I
[1:32:20] was about
[1:32:21] 10. Started probably smoking pot when I
[1:32:23] was about 12, 13. And did all kinds of
[1:32:26] crazy stuff, you know. All kind. Even I
[1:32:30] go that time when I went and cried at
[1:32:32] the altar. I knew God did something to
[1:32:34] me that day. I knew he bore witness with
[1:32:36] me. Something happened. And I'd go back
[1:32:39] in the woods with my buddies and we had
[1:32:41] forts all in the woods, you know. We
[1:32:42] rode bicycles all me. And it wasn't the
[1:32:44] woods. Yeah. And we had all kinds of
[1:32:47] bass, you know, just was being wild
[1:32:49] humans, you know, we was wild humans and
[1:32:51] go out there to smoke and I felt so
[1:32:54] convicted on the inside. Oh, it tear me
[1:32:56] up, but you know, I didn't want to
[1:32:59] I didn't want to offend, right? I can
[1:33:02] remember times later on in life, and I'm
[1:33:05] not going to
[1:33:07] go too far into
[1:33:09] it, but I can remember times in
[1:33:12] life when God would pull on me. Sure.
[1:33:16] And I'd want to surrender to God.
[1:33:19] I'd want to so badly and I'd try. Amen.
[1:33:22] I mean, I tried. I'd come to the altar.
[1:33:24] I'd make an effort. I remember one time
[1:33:27] God miraculously healed me when I had a
[1:33:30] motorcycle wreck. I mean, miraculously
[1:33:31] healed me. I had hair down almost my
[1:33:34] back. I weighed 180 lbs. I was a drug
[1:33:36] deal. I had earrings in my
[1:33:38] ears. And God actually healed me in the
[1:33:41] hospital. He touched me so strongly that
[1:33:45] cussing totally left my vocabulary. And
[1:33:47] my buddies were embarrassed to go
[1:33:49] anywhere with me. I had such a filthy
[1:33:51] mouth. I didn't have to try to quit
[1:33:52] cussing. It was gone. That's right. And
[1:33:56] the thing is in my experience,
[1:34:01] I even went back out in the world again.
[1:34:03] Oh yeah. Being honest, I went to a
[1:34:05] church and I'd actually went to places
[1:34:08] and told people about the my experience
[1:34:10] with God, my
[1:34:11] healing. And I was going to a church
[1:34:13] that was so full of
[1:34:15] hypocrites. Now, I don't put this off on
[1:34:17] them. I'm just telling you the truth.
[1:34:18] I'm not putting it off on nobody. I
[1:34:21] didn't have to do I mean, I made my own
[1:34:22] choices, right? But it was so full of
[1:34:26] hypocrites that and I mean to the point
[1:34:29] to where you know man seen a choir
[1:34:31] actually taught Sunday school sometime
[1:34:32] you know he had a mistress that come
[1:34:34] church with him you know he had a wife
[1:34:36] and had two kids I mean I'm talking
[1:34:38] about just straight up hypocrisy people
[1:34:40] always want to cause trouble you
[1:34:42] know you know you'd be at church one
[1:34:44] time and go something go somewhere else
[1:34:46] wasn't that custom talking about women
[1:34:48] you know and I said I told him one night
[1:34:50] I said
[1:34:52] God I know what you done for me. I know
[1:34:55] you healed my leg. I know the thing. I I
[1:34:58] know you're real. But if these people
[1:35:00] are Christians, I don't want to be a
[1:35:02] Christian, right? Yeah. Amen. It totally
[1:35:05] just like brother Gamma said today, a
[1:35:06] lukewarm Christian will send more souls
[1:35:09] to hell, right? Than anything cuz it
[1:35:12] makes you have an idea that there's no
[1:35:13] bread in the bread house. That there's
[1:35:15] no actual life in this thing. That it's
[1:35:17] just a lifestyle. And I told him, I
[1:35:21] said, "God, I don't want to be a
[1:35:24] Christian." And you know, and I actually
[1:35:26] went back out in the world for a while
[1:35:28] and I almost died
[1:35:30] twice. It come to the point one night I
[1:35:33] did so much
[1:35:34] coke. So much cocaine that I went to a
[1:35:38] restaurant and my left no, my left arm
[1:35:40] went numb. I had chest pains and next
[1:35:43] thing I know I'd blacked out and I'd lay
[1:35:45] in the floor and of course all the guys
[1:35:48] I was with so you know it was all drug
[1:35:50] dealers so you know they don't want
[1:35:52] nothing to do with that you know they
[1:35:53] want to give a run you know they don't
[1:35:54] care about you they just you know they
[1:35:56] know you going to bring the police and
[1:35:57] the
[1:35:58] ambulance I'm laying out in the floor
[1:36:00] don't even know how I got in the floor I
[1:36:03] get up in this restaurant
[1:36:09] it was so filthy so dirty
[1:36:14] All right. And I crawled into this
[1:36:19] bathroom as dirtiest as
[1:36:21] any gas station bathroom you ever seen
[1:36:24] in your
[1:36:25] life. I crawl in there on my hands and
[1:36:28] knees. My lights dimming, going in and
[1:36:30] out. My eyes are still
[1:36:32] open. I rip my shirt
[1:36:35] off and I start getting water out of the
[1:36:38] toilet.
[1:36:42] started splashing in my face. Yeah.
[1:36:45] And just crying to God, "God, please
[1:36:48] don't let me die."
[1:36:51] Cuz I can honestly say at that time, I
[1:36:53] didn't know who God was. Oh, yeah.
[1:36:55] Right. But I knew that he was real.
[1:36:58] He had been with me since I was just a
[1:37:00] little kid. I'd always talked to him,
[1:37:03] but I didn't know who he was. Yeah. I
[1:37:06] didn't believe in him.
[1:37:09] I had no understanding of who he was.
[1:37:13] I cried, "God, don't let me die. Please
[1:37:15] don't let me
[1:37:16] die." And somehow I know I didn't
[1:37:20] die. Probably went two months later. Me
[1:37:24] and my wife wasn't married at the time,
[1:37:26] but we was dating. was over around here
[1:37:29] in
[1:37:30] Atlanta, a big humongous party up
[1:37:34] in well, I can't remember the name of
[1:37:36] place, but a big bridge
[1:37:40] neighborhood. And I did a whole bunch of
[1:37:42] cocaine, a bunch of acid, a bunch of
[1:37:47] heroin. And I was sitting there and the
[1:37:49] next thing I know, I just fell
[1:37:51] backwards. and my eyes are open and the
[1:37:54] light just go out and they're just going
[1:37:57] in and out like this right here. But I'm
[1:37:58] totally my eyes will go
[1:38:00] away. I just keep
[1:38:03] stumbling. Now I was the type of person
[1:38:06] that kind of stuff didn't happen to
[1:38:10] me. I had a real high tolerance for
[1:38:14] stuff. And then again the same thing
[1:38:17] happens. I fall in my face. I start
[1:38:20] crawling again.
[1:38:22] He got me in the same place again
[1:38:26] in these people's
[1:38:27] bathroom. I tear my shirt off
[1:38:32] again and I soak my face with water out
[1:38:34] of the
[1:38:36] toilet. I ask God, "Please don't let me
[1:38:40] die." And I don't
[1:38:44] die. And time comes on and I remember
[1:38:47] going to a church.
[1:38:50] My mama wanted us to go. I love my mama.
[1:38:54] There's things I do for my mama that's I
[1:38:56] just did it for
[1:38:58] her. And my wife my wife, she didn't
[1:39:01] know nothing about God. She wasn't
[1:39:04] really raised in church. And the only
[1:39:07] thing she did know was a bunch of you
[1:39:08] ain't supposed to cut your hair and you
[1:39:09] ain't supposed to wear pants. And that
[1:39:11] was really it.
[1:39:14] We go to this charismatic
[1:39:18] church and we do it. At this point, I
[1:39:21] didn't have a spot on my lung. I know. I
[1:39:24] smoked marijuana so heavily. I smoked it
[1:39:26] for years, all day
[1:39:29] long. And every time I'd breathe, I'd
[1:39:31] have a pain in my chest. It got so bad
[1:39:35] when I smoked dope. I It hurt so bad I
[1:39:37] didn't even want to smoke it no more cuz
[1:39:39] I get so paranoid I was going to die
[1:39:41] because I knew it was a
[1:39:43] spot. And uh but God was dealing with
[1:39:47] me. I had a happen that I I'm going to
[1:39:50] save time. I'm not going to share. But I
[1:39:51] had it and I remember sitting outside
[1:39:53] the front porch smoking a cigarette and
[1:39:56] I said, "God, I don't
[1:39:59] care. I
[1:40:01] don't why would a drug addict think like
[1:40:04] this?
[1:40:08] I'm looking out there at my yard and I
[1:40:10] say, "God, that blade of grass, I got to
[1:40:13] cut it all the
[1:40:15] time. His lifespan is just like
[1:40:19] that." I said, "God, I know my lifespan
[1:40:21] is just like that." I said, "But I want
[1:40:24] to die doing something for you,
[1:40:27] God. I want to I want to live for you.
[1:40:29] But I didn't know who God was. How can
[1:40:32] you do something for somebody? Brother
[1:40:34] Dale, but saying if I was willing to
[1:40:36] give you $25 and I didn't know who you
[1:40:39] were, I mean, how can I give you
[1:40:40] anything? I can't do it. I can't even I
[1:40:43] don't even know how to address you. We
[1:40:46] went to this church. My mother wanted to
[1:40:48] go my wife. You know, I grew up in
[1:40:49] church some and I see women that went to
[1:40:51] church and their husband ain't go to
[1:40:52] church.
[1:40:55] And I remember even back then, the old
[1:40:58] heathen that I was, it made me mad for
[1:41:00] some reason. I just thought I just
[1:41:02] thought if he loved her, he'd go to
[1:41:03] church. Whether he wanted to go to
[1:41:05] church or not, that's just me, you know.
[1:41:07] That's just my
[1:41:09] personality.
[1:41:10] And I'm not saying it's true. That's
[1:41:13] just my personality. And my wife, she's
[1:41:15] getting up to go to church one morning
[1:41:17] and I talk her out of it one morning.
[1:41:18] when the next Sunday comes around, she
[1:41:20] going to go and I lay in her bed and I
[1:41:22] try to talk her out of it and ain't no
[1:41:23] talking her out of it. And I said,
[1:41:25] "Well, I ain't going to be like one of
[1:41:26] them men. I'm going to go to church."
[1:41:28] You know, they ain't want to go to
[1:41:30] church. High as a kite, they want to go
[1:41:32] to church. I go to
[1:41:34] church and we go two times and I
[1:41:36] remember I'm sitting there and this man,
[1:41:39] the Lord actually drops down on me in
[1:41:40] this charismatic
[1:41:42] church to the point to where I'm start
[1:41:45] snotting. I'm sitting there in a
[1:41:48] pew and they asked us to raise our hands
[1:41:51] and we raised our hands. Me and my wife
[1:41:54] did. She actually did first and I wanted
[1:41:59] to. She actually gave me a little
[1:42:01] courage cuz I was sitting there. I said,
[1:42:03] "God, I'm sitting here lusting after
[1:42:05] these
[1:42:06] women. But I want to live right. I can't
[1:42:09] even think right. I don't even know how
[1:42:11] to even start to be right." But I was in
[1:42:14] such a condition that God was melting my
[1:42:18] heart. And he asked us to come up front.
[1:42:20] And when he
[1:42:22] did, the man didn't even touch me. The
[1:42:26] night before I was stoned as I'll get
[1:42:29] out. I was a
[1:42:31] druggie. He ain't even touch
[1:42:33] me. And he said like a I guess you call
[1:42:36] like a prophecy over me. And next thing
[1:42:38] I knew I was laying on the
[1:42:42] floor. I ain't never had nothing like
[1:42:44] that happen to me in my life. Never. The
[1:42:46] man didn't even touch me. I laid there
[1:42:48] for probably 30 to 40 minutes and my
[1:42:51] poor wife was standing there and people
[1:42:52] was around her speaking in tongues. She
[1:42:54] ain't never heard nobody talk in
[1:42:56] tongues. She and then she looked down.
[1:42:58] I'm laying in the floor. She ain't never
[1:43:00] been no Pentecostal
[1:43:01] church. I laid there and when I got
[1:43:05] up I was a different person. Bless him.
[1:43:09] When I had that motorcycle, I reckon God
[1:43:10] healed me and he took away my foul
[1:43:12] mouth. He did it again. Amen. Not only
[1:43:15] did he take away my foul mouth, but he
[1:43:17] took away my desire to do drugs. G. He
[1:43:20] took away my I loved golf. Now, I ain't
[1:43:23] got nothing against golf, but I love
[1:43:24] golf so much that it was about to tear
[1:43:26] my family apart. I wanted to retire
[1:43:28] playing golf. That was my goal. And when
[1:43:30] I went to play golf, I did it as if it
[1:43:32] was a job and if I was practicing. I was
[1:43:34] going to retire playing golf. There
[1:43:36] ain't no way I was going to live my life
[1:43:37] at the phone company. I was going to
[1:43:38] retire playing golf. When I got up out
[1:43:41] of that
[1:43:43] floor, I had no desire to play golf
[1:43:45] whatsoever. I didn't even didn't want
[1:43:49] to. Amen. But that was my passion. God
[1:43:52] healed me of that
[1:43:54] spot. You know, people think, you know,
[1:43:56] ain't nothing going on out in them
[1:43:58] churches out there. There's not unless
[1:44:00] you will see the God. Now, if you see to
[1:44:02] God, God will drop you a handful. God's
[1:44:05] going to come get you. He's gonna stop
[1:44:07] whatever he's doing and he's gonna come
[1:44:09] and get you. I don't care if you're in a
[1:44:10] Baptist, Methodist, or in a Catholic
[1:44:12] church. I think one of the scarest
[1:44:14] places to be a lot of times in a
[1:44:15] Methodist church. It takes more power of
[1:44:17] God coming out of this church than it
[1:44:19] does out church. That is
[1:44:22] [Applause]
[1:44:26] true. But when I was there,
[1:44:30] God done something for me. Amen.
[1:44:33] And then as I went all along my
[1:44:36] way, God began to justify me.
[1:44:40] Oh, I won't never
[1:44:41] forget. I was singing in the
[1:44:44] choir. I told brother I told brother day
[1:44:47] this morning. So about the end before I
[1:44:48] had the Holy Ghost, you know, life ain't
[1:44:51] hard when you got the Holy Ghost.
[1:44:52] Really, it's really simple. And uh for
[1:44:54] the most part, you just float around
[1:44:56] doing whatever you want to do. Devil
[1:44:57] don't much care about what you're doing.
[1:44:59] And I don't care how religious you I
[1:45:00] don't care how much you sing, preach, or
[1:45:02] help the sick, cast out devils. He don't
[1:45:03] care nothing about you. And uh I told
[1:45:06] the guy, I went to church three, four
[1:45:08] times a week. I just loved it. Every
[1:45:09] time I go to church, I go to church. I
[1:45:11] mean, you talking about sick, it didn't
[1:45:13] matter. There was nothing in me that
[1:45:14] ever made me not want to go to church. I
[1:45:16] mean, it was just right. Amen. You know,
[1:45:19] hey, when you get the Holy Ghost is
[1:45:20] different, you know, that's just the
[1:45:22] truth. I love going to truth. I mean,
[1:45:24] going to church right here, but like he
[1:45:25] said this morning, sometimes sometimes
[1:45:28] you don't out here, but back then it
[1:45:30] wasn't that
[1:45:31] way. But God healed me there, that spot
[1:45:35] in my
[1:45:37] lung. And you know, as I was saying, you
[1:45:40] know, when people say things don't
[1:45:41] happen, I was sitting there first time I
[1:45:42] ever took communion again. It wasn't
[1:45:44] even right communion. It was a little
[1:45:46] bit wafer and a thing of grape
[1:45:49] juice. And look, but you know, brother
[1:45:52] Maram says, you know, you taking a look
[1:45:54] at them
[1:45:55] Jews when they come to that
[1:45:58] sacrifice, how can they get numb to the
[1:46:00] sound of that bleeding lamb when they
[1:46:02] take it up there to be sacrificed? But
[1:46:04] he said it become a stench in the
[1:46:05] nostrils. But you know, God, if you do
[1:46:08] it sincerity, God honor it. You know, if
[1:46:10] it's God's way, you do it sincerity, he
[1:46:12] honors it. I didn't know no more what I
[1:46:14] was doing. But man, I was sitting there,
[1:46:16] I was weeping so much. I had so much
[1:46:18] love and joy in my heart that I could
[1:46:20] actually take communion. Amen.
[1:46:23] And that God loved me,
[1:46:25] right?
[1:46:28] And he picked me up. Glory. I mean, I
[1:46:31] was so full of love in my heart. I
[1:46:34] couldn't even hardly eat or drink it. I
[1:46:35] was in sitting there crying. And the man
[1:46:37] I had on a red shirt and the our pastor
[1:46:41] at that time he said somebody right
[1:46:43] there around that gym with that red
[1:46:44] shirt on. God just and right as he's
[1:46:47] saying that I feel fire go all the way
[1:46:49] from my waist up to my head. He said God
[1:46:52] just healed somebody of a chest
[1:46:54] condition right here. Right around this
[1:46:55] guy in a red shirt right here. And look
[1:46:58] that spot on my chest has never hurt.
[1:47:01] Glory. One time it hurt me a few years
[1:47:03] ago and I rebuked it and it was gone.
[1:47:05] But I mean, it hurts so bad to where if
[1:47:07] I just got out of a golf cart to walk up
[1:47:09] to a green to make a putt, oh, it would
[1:47:11] just kill me. It hurts so bad. But God
[1:47:14] healed me of that. And we come and God
[1:47:17] God used me in many ways. I mean, many
[1:47:21] ways. I seen people, me and some people,
[1:47:24] this guy was demonp possessed one night,
[1:47:26] spitting up foam at the mouth all the
[1:47:28] back of the church. We took him out
[1:47:29] there. Me and some more people prayed
[1:47:30] for him. The devil was trying to
[1:47:32] strangle him. All kinds of stuff. And
[1:47:33] before he left, the guy was speaking in
[1:47:35] tongues. He was in his same mind. And
[1:47:37] when we left that church, he was still
[1:47:39] going to that church. When he come in,
[1:47:40] he was a he was a real bad street
[1:47:42] walking crackhead. And he stayed there
[1:47:44] in his same mind till he left. Now, does
[1:47:47] that mean he was born again? No. Brother
[1:47:51] Brown said Peter was in a sanctified
[1:47:53] condition when he was casting out devil.
[1:47:55] Healing the sick.
[1:47:57] He never had he never been converted.
[1:48:00] But see things and I seen those things
[1:48:02] happen. and my wife's father-in-law and
[1:48:04] my wife's dead. My father-in-law, he
[1:48:07] come and he'd tell me
[1:48:09] about wheat
[1:48:11] and writing a name on a check and all
[1:48:14] this kind of stuff and tell me that,
[1:48:16] hey, he said, you know, you ain't even
[1:48:19] saved. I thought, man, you know, you got
[1:48:22] to be joking, man. I mean, you you done
[1:48:25] hit your head. Well, if you ain't
[1:48:27] baptized no more Jesus Christ, you can't
[1:48:28] even get the Holy Ghost. I said, are you
[1:48:30] are you crazy? I
[1:48:33] said, "The life proves what I'm doing.
[1:48:36] Look at look at how God is actually
[1:48:38] manifesting himself in my life. God
[1:48:40] brought me out. He set my feet on a
[1:48:44] rock." I said, "What? What are you
[1:48:46] talking about?" He said, "Well, you
[1:48:47] know, when wheat starts to sprout, it
[1:48:50] comes through, you got a stalk, and you
[1:48:51] have a tossel." And you I said, "Man,
[1:48:53] are you what is wrong with you talking
[1:48:55] about some weed?" I said, "Want to talk
[1:48:58] about, you know, when when's the last
[1:49:00] time you went and and taught somebody
[1:49:02] about God? You know, when was the last
[1:49:03] time God prophesied through you? When
[1:49:05] was the last time God did this, did
[1:49:06] that?" That's what we was used to. Yeah.
[1:49:08] Right. I will never forget one night he
[1:49:11] pointed his finger at
[1:49:13] me. He'd come there and I just about
[1:49:16] chased him out the house talking to him.
[1:49:18] I wouldn't listen to nothing he said. I
[1:49:20] mean, I was listening. One day I was
[1:49:22] sitting there, these people was actually
[1:49:25] they gave us a little syllabus when we
[1:49:27] first
[1:49:28] started. They gave their
[1:49:31] doctrine and it said uh it was about
[1:49:34] water baptism and it
[1:49:36] said we know that the New Testament
[1:49:38] church baptized in the Lord name in the
[1:49:40] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. We know
[1:49:41] that Peter understood that that was you
[1:49:44] know Jehovah you know Lord God. We knew
[1:49:47] they had that understanding. He said,
[1:49:48] "But we baptize and name Father, Son,
[1:49:51] and Holy
[1:49:52] Ghost." And I sit there, man, I and I
[1:49:55] was like this line went
[1:49:56] across and that's when God came and
[1:49:59] actually showed me something, right?
[1:50:03] God started to show me his sacrifice,
[1:50:07] right?
[1:50:10] And as I began to see this sacrifice, as
[1:50:13] I began to see him in his word, oh, it
[1:50:17] kind of hurt for me cuz I said, "Man,
[1:50:18] I'm going to have to go and tell John,
[1:50:20] my father-in-law, so I go tell but John
[1:50:22] I was wrong. He's right." You know, and
[1:50:26] then all of a sudden, God started
[1:50:27] showing me all kind I mean, just start
[1:50:29] opening up his word to me. And the whole
[1:50:31] thing to get
[1:50:34] to is that that in itself is God's blood
[1:50:38] sacrifice. His word, him showing himself
[1:50:42] to you, you got to place your hands on
[1:50:46] that sacrifice. If you don't own that
[1:50:49] sacrifice, if you don't associate
[1:50:50] yourself with that sacrifice, if that
[1:50:52] sacrifice ate inside of you, there's no
[1:50:55] way that you can be dead in Christ and
[1:50:57] risen again. There's no way you can be
[1:50:59] born again without God coming and
[1:51:01] showing himself to you. Right? And I
[1:51:04] just urge any of my brothers and
[1:51:07] sisters, if there's a heaviness in your
[1:51:10] heart, if there's a heavy feeling on
[1:51:13] your chest at all, any kind of a feeling
[1:51:16] of pressure from God,
[1:51:22] just ask. Glory. Amen. If you ask in the
[1:51:25] right attitude and sincerely, he's got
[1:51:28] to tell you. And when he does, he's not
[1:51:32] a respector of person. You come his
[1:51:34] provided way. He's got to show you. And
[1:51:37] when he does, there's been times and
[1:51:40] times throughout life, I wanted to get
[1:51:42] right with God. I wanted to, but I
[1:51:47] couldn't. It was not God's time. When
[1:51:50] it's God's time, it will happen. But the
[1:51:53] thing is, if you get a a calling from
[1:51:56] God, you can't reject it. If you get a
[1:51:58] calling to go forward, you can't step
[1:52:00] back and say, "I don't know. I don't
[1:52:03] want that." It's a fellowship. How can
[1:52:07] you disassociate yourself from your
[1:52:09] sacrifice? Don't you realize that
[1:52:11] staying with that logos, staying with
[1:52:13] that that unveiling of the word, that is
[1:52:17] your lamb. That's your sacrifice. If you
[1:52:20] ain't inside of that, there ain't no
[1:52:22] blood to cover you. You can't sit
[1:52:24] outside and say, "Well, God, I'll come
[1:52:26] over there later." You can't do that.
[1:52:28] There's no blood bumper for you. I don't
[1:52:30] care what's going on. I don't care if
[1:52:32] you casting out devils. You got to hit a
[1:52:34] ministry. If you preach all over the
[1:52:36] world, God, there's no blood bumper for
[1:52:39] you. I just urge you if the musicians
[1:52:42] would
[1:52:43] come, I just urge you. I ask you
[1:52:47] please. You may have tried time and time
[1:52:50] again. I'm not going to give no
[1:52:52] prolonged altar call. And I tell you the
[1:52:55] reason why.
[1:52:57] I believe in him. I sure do. Lord, I
[1:53:00] believe in him 100%.
[1:53:03] But God come to me when I sitting in my
[1:53:05] bathroom.
[1:53:08] I believe a lot of times just like when
[1:53:10] Daniel sat there and he prayed, he
[1:53:11] fasted
[1:53:13] and Gabriel came. And he said, "The
[1:53:14] prince of pers has been fighting me or I
[1:53:16] would have been here already." Yeah,
[1:53:18] that's right. It's just like the sister
[1:53:20] that accepted her healing and it had to
[1:53:22] come later on and come through to her
[1:53:23] neighborhood. I can't remember how many
[1:53:24] days later, but it come over and healed
[1:53:26] her and the other sister both.
[1:53:30] I'm not even going to ask you to raise
[1:53:31] your hand.
[1:53:34] Cuz it ain't between me and you.
[1:53:37] People say, "Well, if you're ashamed of
[1:53:39] me, I'll be ashamed of you." And that's
[1:53:41] right. God said, "I believe that." But
[1:53:43] if God does something for you, there
[1:53:46] ain't a devil in hell that'll keep you
[1:53:49] from manifesting that fruit in your
[1:53:50] life. There ain't a devil in hell that's
[1:53:52] going to make you be quiet about what
[1:53:54] God's doing for you. There ain't a devil
[1:53:55] in hell that's going to keep you bound
[1:53:57] by the same things you was bound
[1:53:58] beforehand. So you ain't got to worry
[1:54:00] about being ashamed because ain't
[1:54:02] nothing going to make you be ashamed if
[1:54:04] it's really God. Right? I'm just urging
[1:54:09] if you feel
[1:54:10] something. Brother D, if you got songs,
[1:54:13] go ahead, brother. Try number 80.
[1:54:17] If you got a feel, if there's a
[1:54:19] heaviness in your heart,
[1:54:22] the altar is in your heart. The altar
[1:54:25] ain't so much up here, you can leave
[1:54:26] here and have an emotional sensation.
[1:54:29] The altar is inside of your heart. Maybe
[1:54:32] when you go home or whatever, but if you
[1:54:34] make a conscious, sober decision, God
[1:54:38] will acknowledge that. Amen. He will
[1:54:41] meet you just like he met Abraham. He'll
[1:54:43] meet you just like he met me. He will
[1:54:45] meet you and give you life just said in
[1:54:49] your heart. If you got in heaven just
[1:54:52] pray pray on the inside bow down in your
[1:54:55] heart. Let's just worship God.
[1:55:00] [Music]
[1:55:18] You got any kind of sickness? I believe
[1:55:20] God. I don't believe there's nothing in
[1:55:21] me. He can heal you. But I believe
[1:55:23] inside of you. I believe the word is
[1:55:26] true. The prayer faith save the sick. I
[1:55:29] believe without you got any kind of
[1:55:31] problems. I just don't care if you want
[1:55:33] to come here and pray anything
[1:55:35] whatsoever. I don't want to shut
[1:55:37] anything up. I want if God wants to

[2:05:22] Council of
[2:05:23] Churches, cuz you know what a combine
[2:05:27] does? A combine binds the

[2:05:34] right?
[2:05:36] It scatters the chaff
[2:05:38] away, but it also puts the wheat in the

[2:06:25] just have a good time in the Lord. And
[2:06:27] that's the best thing to do. Amen. cuz
[2:06:29] that's our life. That's right. We don't
[2:06:31] have any other life. It's this message.
[2:06:33] Amen. You love the Lord. Just tell our
[2:06:35] brothers and them that you appreciate
[2:06:37] him. Father, we thank you. We ask you,
[2:06:39] Lord, that you would just be with us now
[2:06:41] as we go our separate ways and everybody
[2:06:43] going home. We pray that you'd take care
[2:06:46] of us. Give a safe journey. And Lord,
[2:06:48] those that were prayed for today, we
[2:06:50] believe that they received what they
[2:06:52] were asking for because why would we
[2:06:55] pray if we didn't believe it that way,
[2:06:57] Father? cuz we know that thou are our
[2:07:00] God and that you want to do more than we
[2:07:02] ever would ever think about wanting you
[2:07:03] even to do. The prophet said you wanted
[2:07:06] to heal us more than we wanted to be
[2:07:07] healed. Well, surely when we're sick, we
[2:07:09] wanted to be healed. And Father, just
[2:07:11] have your way now. Guide each one. Take
[2:07:13] care of everybody on the highways. Let
[2:07:15] your love be made manifest in Jesus
[2:07:18] name. Amen. You're dismissed.
