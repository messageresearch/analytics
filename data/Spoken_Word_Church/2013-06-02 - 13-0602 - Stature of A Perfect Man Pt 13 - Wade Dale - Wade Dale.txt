TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Peter one I know it gets a little crowded and there's only one little air conditioning event down here so bear with us second Peter 1 let's go ahead and read this up here all right everybody ready yeah can't read it while you're thr somebody else Simon Peter and a servant and Apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like Precious face so he's not talking to the world he's talking to me and you all right he's talking to the ones that are born again so this has nothing to do with the outside world this is kind of like marriage and divorce it has nothing to do with the outside world CU we're going to read here in a few minutes what brother brandham said that um you can have a portion of these virtues and not even be born again can everybody see that from this side Jo you see it okay I Dan a that better GL see you got it yeah I got it okay all right like Precious Faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ Grace and peace he multiplied unto you the to the knowledge of God and Jesus our lord according as his divine power ha given unto us all things that pertain under life and godliness so this is what he's talking about life and godliness all right through the knowledge of him that has called us remember we don't call oursel he calls us to what glory and virtue whereby are given so they're gifts these are gifts that God wants to give you but he doesn't automatically give them to you right and it's not that you have to earn them you have them with you when you get the new birth but you have to do what we talking about Wednesday night you got to exercise them you got to you got to use them all right and we'll read in just a few minutes what brother R said about that you got to make yourself available for God to work those virtues out through your life all right and and remember one thing if you're born again you're born again if you're born again at Faith you're just as Eternal as God is but God does see that's God requires that you go further he requires that these babies grow up he doesn't require that they stay babies he requires that they grow up right they don't want them to stay baby sure we want the little cute things to stay babies and do little cute things but you know what that's not normal so we want to you know we want to be normal Christians as it pertains to life and godliness all right whereby are given unto us exceeding in other words all great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust that's your new birth that's the thing that's changed you from what what you were to what you are now it's like I was stay Wednesday night you can hate me or you can love me if you don't go to church more now than you did 6 months ago your backslid or lost one of the two that's what the Bible said not me what the Bible say so you can pretty much check your own self up brother said you know where you're at with God at any moment well you know what if you miss church about three or four times a month you'll know that you're either lost or back live one all right and that's not my word that's his I didn't bring that today but I'll sure bring it and read it to you and besides this see besides the new birth see besides this besides the new birth see besides this what besides receiving the divine nature of God to change you into a Son of God to make you a Son of God and daughter of God and besides this giving all diligence see that's what I mean about being diligent there's two deds Dory and diligent and they're totally opposite I I think in Lea we become dilatory not diligent cuz diligent would make you see things in a different way all right and besides this giving all diligence add to what you believe right add to your faith cuz it's the only what it's what you believe all right add to your faith virtue add to your faith knowledge I'm not adding to the word right cuz it's adding to the new it's not you get all the new birth that you need but then there's little things that like brother R said remember he preached before this he preached the key key was Faith the door was Jesus uh read the book sometime or listen to the tape doors IND doors cuz you walk in the front door of the house meaning you're born again you walk into the front door of the house open the door and you walk in but now there's certain rooms in there you know we have four bedrooms three and a half bathrooms and and those of you that's been there we got several doors but you know having several doors we can uh we started early for your sake so I could talk about you hey brother K how you doing brother good to see you Lord bless your heart and uh you can find my thought that I was just saying uh doors thank you I knew that somebody pick it up somebody's paying attention besides me house you walk in a house you got doors now brother Brown PRS doors and doors God walks up to one door and you say no you can't come in that door why there's something behind it you don't want him to see right and remember the door knobs are on the inside they're not on the outside he's not going remember brother B said one time and it really struck me he said the whole Holy Ghost is a gentleman he's not overbearing he's not overpowering sure he empowers you and gives you power but he's a gentleman you do something wrong brother said the Holy Ghost to go out on the limb now that doesn't mean he goes out of you and goes over here you what he does is is he's going hey till you behave I'm going to go right out here for a minute and when you get all your stuff worked out I'm going to come back that don't mean you lose your Holy Ghost and you everybody understand that you don't lose you can't lose the Holy Ghost if you're born again again but you can grieve it the Bible says grieve not the holy spirit of God where by your SE so you can grieve it away brother R said you have to ask him to come back same thing with the door he's not just going to come you know going through the door just open the door and come no he's going to go you mind if I come in yeah you mind if I come see you okay that's exactly what these virtues are they're doors indoors because look that says right there Tabernacle well inside Tabernacle you got doors or you got skins Badger skins you know they had skins before they had doors so it was Badger skin had it covered up now we're supposed to be where everything is uncovered all right so it's besides this giving all diligence add to your faith it's an individual Walk With God all right it's not it's not we're not we're sure we're going to take a wrap in a group but there are levels of understanding that you can come to or you can't come to one of the two all right besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to Virtue knowledge and to knowledge Temperance Temperance patience patience godliness godliness brotherly kindness and brotherly kindness charity all right for if these things be in you yes in you I in yeah we're in second Peter 1 in you all right and I know y'all and nobody came late but let's try to start about 5 or 10 minutes before because if you don't we just sit in here and Y and talk about the world and get all that on our mind and brother Dale wants them to be um in their Sunday school class and nobody out so let's just kind of keep it quiet a little bit if you don't mind and uh you can talk about grocery shopping and who you saw on the internet outside or something somewhere but let's just kind of keep it to where uh to where we start thinking about God a little bit sooner cuz it's not humanly we're not like a light switch I'm not so I know you're not I have to start that's why the Bible says meditate on me meditate in other words just kind of get up in the morning like I did with this I didn't really sit down and go well I'm going to use quote this and this but I had a line that I that I'm trying to go down same way with Dad dad's got a line he's trying to go down right and then the Lord may move that line up over all right but still it's a meditation of even just driving from home to here 8 minutes you can get a sermon or something that you need to say to the people and I believe it's what God working on both ends if somebody had a question God will give an answer right cuz we go different ways and we go why we do that but we know it's what God knows we don't for if these things be in you verse eight in you not on you see it can be on you that's like sister breita was asking last night she said brother R said there's a difference in the baptism of Holy Ghost and the new birth that's exactly correct you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost every day of your life on your spirit and die and go to hell Joel said I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh so there's an anointing all over this world you say of the Holy Spirit absolutely which what brother Brown he preached anointed ones at the end time when he preached anointed ones at the end time he said they're Anointed with the truth true baptism of the Holy Ghost but they're false inside right that's what we're contending with right now that's not a future event we're contending with that right now all right cuz you can be Sanctified anointed Sanctified of God and die and go to heaven Judas did Judas did right I know I see some eyeballs popping out but that's exactly the TR that's right you can have the Holy Ghost that's a direct quote from Brother R you can have the Holy Ghost on your spirit you hear what I said on your spirit every day of your life be religious come to this church sit here think everything's all right but you turn the word down one time your B child I when I think of that I always remember the experience you absolutely why' God put brother Brown through those experiences so they would be forever imprinted in our mind that when we come to a point to where somebody's everybody understand what she's talking about all right the Misha experience where brother BR went he met these Pentecostals and that one would stand up and prophesy and the other one would speak in tongues and one would interpret and God met and brother BR met the one this when he was just a young boy but he still had that gift so he went over and contacted this man genuine Christian he went over and make contact with the one that was doing the interpreting what living with another woman had two children by her and was married living in adultery and doing what he was doing all right so and remember that stuned brother brandom a little bit until he went up to the cave remember God come through with the wind and blew it to Hebrews what is it 6 or 7 it says the rain falls on the just and the unjust all right so that's what Joel said Joel said I pour out my spirit on All Flesh so All Flesh has an anointing even the Sinners even a sinner has an anointing how do you think they um well you are a sinner if you're if you're not born again the they don't even they're not even counted in that see you got your you got your people that are total unbelievers that do not that'll never that'll never that's never had his name put on a book except the book of Sinners remember we went through the book of life and the books there's books inside of books judas's name was put on the book as a Believer then it was erased out because of what he he didn't go on with God he stopped right same way with you and I that's what I say about coming to church and doing things doing Christian things you don't have to you don't have to uh live here but I I promise you one thing this is where I get my fuel right here I get my fuel right here I I'm not going to go to a a candy store and get gasoline I need gasoline from my car so I stop at a place that's got gasoline all right so these things are are required they're required like I said goats are hardheaded I've got three of them I watch them every day they would absolutely kill theirself to get through that wire to get to something else that they've already got in their pin because it's over there but now remember a sheep has to be led all right and that's what we want to be we want to be sheep but now brother br will say in a minute I think I got that quote where brother BR said sheep manufacturers wool they don't have to stand there and go produce wool produce wool no they just eat they eat and then what they eat produces what they are all right same way with you and I the gospel to miss now is just more simple than it ever has been even having Revelation more than I had you know several years ago it just become more simple that truly the Bible says that the godhead can be explained by the things that we see and here that we see that and I had read this many times in verse three where it says that all things pertain unto life what that's not just you're alive it's your life the life you live and godliness what here you got to put those two together like I say Wednesday night brother R said the book is sealed on the front and the back but it better be the same seal on the front as it is on the back people see you coming forward or walking away from you they ought to see the same thing in other words you ought to bring what you do at work to hear and not be ashamed of any of it any of it if you are it's a problem with a seal somewhere okay all right that's what I mean we we got to have a checkup here everybody's got to we got to everybody we all got to have a checkup if these things be in you verse eight and abound not just be in you but they abound what does abound mean abundance overflowing right you get a bountiful crop then you got so much with it you don't know what to do with it so you give it to everybody else well that's what these virtues are Peter said Silver and Gold Have I None Like I said he had no money he had no way to get the person healed but what he had inside of him such as I do have Peter says I give I unto thee rise up and walk so he had the amount of money in the checkbook to write the check with our problem is we sometimes we write checks they ain't no money in the bank and what does it do brother Brown said it bounces right so now and that's us cuz God's checkbook never bounces all right cuz when you start with this divine nature of God God does give you a check Prophet City he gives you a check with his name on it cuz you know what he doesn't really trust you or is it that you can't trust yourself cuz he knows the in from the beginning he knows what you're going to do with it when he gives it to you why said and this will hit you one day just like a brick like it did me God's knows are the best yeses you've ever heard cuz if he says no if you say God I want to go down this line he says no what happens is he knows what's going to happen to you if he says yes and it will be a disaster so if he keeps saying no maybe he's wanting you to turn and go this way and here's where his yeses are okay cuz he knows and we don't so it's not this is not for his edification there's nothing in the Bible to edify God he don't need it or he's not God it's for mine and your edification it's for God not to believe in you it's for you to believe in yourself okay you to believe that God's with you and that God's going to and we know what God doing it but it's a both of you are in there you have a choice you have a choice that's what he showed Abraham when he was going to kill Isaac he wanted Abraham to see how much Faith he had in absolutely absolutely and that's exactly the truth because I believe Abraham was going to get kill him I believe he was going to kill him and I believe God knew he was going to kill him or he had put that he would have put that angel there to stop his hand well that angel stopped his hand and I'm I'm pretty sure that hand may have been coming down and he grabbed that thing and said no wait a minute Abraham now I know now God don't say now I know how can somebody all knowing say now I know he's saying Abraham now you should know that I'm with you and whatever I say I'm going to do for you you're going to believe it you know that's why he was a father by faith he just believed Abraham just believed had problems in his life and all but still he he believed for if these things be in you and abound they make you they will make you act this way all right that's what the Bible says they'll make you act like this stature of a perfect man all right that you shall neither be Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but he that lath these things is blind not physically but spiritually all right you're spiritually blind and cannot see a far off what's a far off Revelation how can you get Revelation if you cut God off you can't God's always moving if we stop then we backlip all right and have forgotten that he was purged from his old sin sometimes we forget sometimes we forget where we came from and God got to remind us wherefore the rather Brethren I don't want that change the time first I ain't postponing wherefore the rather Brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if ye do these things you shall never fall wow what a promise if you do these things and and I'm going to use sister PR for an example cuz you don't mind being on a diet you got to be on a diet all the time that's right I said Freda she said it ain't working I said you doing it 100% no I said then don't blame the diet blame the person that's saying this right here this is the promise that if you'll do these things take this prescription you'll never fall now right there is a promise and I wrote right there promise in my Bible right there promise but look how you going to get it I haven't read this before I've always stops but listen to this as we go up we're going to read a little more verse 11 for so an entrance or a door shall be ministered unto you abundantly fivefolds of it you can't you cannot get these virtues and have them working in your life by yourself Peter did didn't he had Jesus Christ almighty God for three and 1/2 years teach him these virtues and when he got the holy ghost boom they became they became Holy Ghost virtue cuz Peter didn't have a lot of patience when Jesus was around he likeed to cut people there off and go to fighting and yeah but now here he's not why he was on this side of born again and this side of born again okay but being born again and what does Peter say Being Born Again by The Incorruptible word Incorruptible word of God so we know what Peter said an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ so how you going to get these verses not by yourself not sitting at home not reading G's Almanac or or um Charles Stanley or Joel Olstein I mean my God people how can you talk to a man Joel things says I don't preach on sin that's why he's got 15,000 people in his church if you start preaching the sin he'd have about 15 sin's our problem I believe I got it in here brother BR said sin means miss the mark sin's not smoking drinking cussing running around with women and all that stuff it's unbelief it's not believing in what God Said So now let's read this brother Brown goes to Hebrews 10 and 5 now we're going to talk about the Tabernacle now Tabernacle is of course a place where we go to rest now get freshness and so forth like resting from sleep or so forth now Hebrews 10 in the 5ifth verse Paul brings it in wherefore when he cometh into the world he sayth sacrifice that's Christ sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not but a body hast thou prepared me what is a tabernacle now a body God tabernacling in a body that do you really believe that is you better or you stop right there God once up high when he came down on the mountain even a bulock or cow touch the mountain he must be killed God is Holy last evening when those angels covered their face holy serap with holy faces don't even know what sin means and they have to cover their face all right got it in the presence of God cover their feet in humility now holy God could could not condone sin so nothing could touch the mountain now you know what he's talking about where Moses told him to bring he said bring the children of Israel back to this mountain and I'll speak to them all right then God was made flesh and dwelt Among Us in the form of Jesus Christ his son his creation then that son gave his life and the blood cell of God was broken that the life might come out of the blood to us so he's transferred whatever he is to us cuz that statute of a perfect man that is that's Jesus portrayed that when he walked on earth right through that blood we are cleansed and now our blood our life which came by living through sexual desire brought our life in the world the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us changes our Nature by sending upon us the Holy Spirit then we become into the divine nature of God then we become a dwelling place for God Jesus said at that day you'll know that I am in the father and father in me I in you and you in me so you see who in you the very Creator know how that God is in his church the church is now supposed to take the place of Christ carrying on his ministry he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also yet a little while in the world seeth me no more yet you shall see me now where are we going to see him at where we going to see him at each other okay in each other see the world that's why I said it's going going to be a secret I was telling the the brothers they were talking about the coming of the Lord and and you know when the Rapture and all these things when we get out of here it's all going to be a secret nobody's going to know about it nobody all right it's a secret catching away because where is Christ Christ is only in the bride indwelling you got me IND dwelling in here that's why it says in the Bible in if these things be in you you in a bound not on you Butz you have an anointing like I said you be anointed for a lot of things there's a lot of anointed preachers around but they're false CU of what they speak all right where was I there it is even in you to the end of the world see there it is carrying on his work but look you notice here he said first got to have what faith and a brother came up to me might have been Sunday and he was real honest and he said I don't have faith for everything and I can hey that's the first place to get that's the first place to get is just say I just don't have faith for that right there well okay then let's work on that right there all right and we all obviously work here we're still here so there's something we don't some of us don't have faith in that's why you need a five-fold Ministry to tell you five different angles of the same story not not five different stories of five different stories I mean five different stories of the same story no you you get five different angles like Matthew Mark Luke and John that's four angles that are totally perfect of the same happening all right so the same way you get with a five-fold Ministry but a five-fold Ministry how many times times his brother Dell preached on I don't know just marriage and divorce but that's a hard one but preached on a new birth and then a preacher come in and preach and just say one little word or one little phrase and you go oh that's what that means and brother Dale has been hammering it for 6 months you needed that because you know what that's why God give you a five-fold Ministry cuz he said he gave some Apostle some prophets that means he didn't give everybody prophets only certain amount of people can handle a prophet only certain amount of people can handle this certain amount of people can handle that right he gave some but all that some is the body of Christ and you can maybe understand something a little bit more from a teacher a lot of people like a teacher because he can slow down he can break the things down for you but some people like an evangelist cuz you have let's just be honest if evangelist really do something for you then you got problems in your life a lot of people are shaking their head and that's exactly the the truth because an evangelist will stir up the emotion in you which is good it's of God stir up the emotion in you and get you to looking at your life or looking at something here or looking at something there right and get you under conviction where a teacher will take somebody that doesn't have a lot of problems sure we all got problems but not as much as the other and I don't like to use the word weaker but brother Brown did call him weak Christian some Christians weak that's why they're at the bottom of the pyramid down at Faith as you go up higher you develop more you get more faith cuz you never lose that Foundation he'll tell you in a minute if we get to it he never never lose that Foundation of Faith you go right back to that Faith every time you need something cuz you you got to have faith that you got virtue you got to have faith that you got knowledge that's why it says add to your faith and that's why I read that add to your faith virtue and the Bible says The Virtue knowledge but I didn't add it in I'm reading between the lines between the lines says add to your faith cuz if you don't have faith for knowledge right there s stop right this is just like a just like Jacob's fladder climbing up climbing up to God and that's what we're doing we're climbing up to God but we notice and see that that having faith we have people that are weak Christians so you take somebody like an evangelist and and and I want to be real honest with you I know brother R said it sometimes I have a hard time believing that brother Ram said every time you go to the altar you get weaker is know what he said every time you go to that altar you get weaker and weaker and weaker he wants you to sit he wanted you to sit in your seat and believe it right that Centurion walked up to Jesus and and said sir I got a problem right I got a person sick in my home Jesus said well let's go he said no you just speak it now and whatever you say that's what will happen we see that he had faith in that never had to have the Bible says lay hands on the sick and they shall recover but the Bible also says speak to the mountain not lay hands on the mountain speak to the mountain but remember you got to have something to move the mountain in you first are you are your check's going to bound all right so we see that how we we do have faith for certain things certain preachers Don't Preach a certain thing but teachers because brother R said teachers positionally places you in the body well a lot of times teachers do preach conviction so much they're the ones that take the ones that are already established in the gospel and carries them further okay and that's just the gifts that you that you have to deal with I mean some people go to sleep on a teacher but they won't on a evangelist or a or a pastor cuz they just sometimes they just can't understand but if evangelist is here and you like them you'll come to church on Wednesday night when you don't tell them anymore L brother that hello but that's the truth why because you have a contact with that person and that's okay that's but what it is you have faith in what that person says right you have a connection so you got to have five folds of it you got to have Apostle Prophet Pastor teach you got have all that all right to help us get up the statute of a perfect man because an entrance has been made ministered to us but first we got to have faith if you don't have faith that you got to come to church every Sunday and listen that's why I said you're either backl or lost there's no in between back ler laws one two and I it's not me to judge but notice here he said first we have faith virtue knowledge temp patience God goodness or godliness and brother love all right brother kindness and then add love let me read this over again I wanted to read it with the way he reads it and besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue The Virtue knowledge knowledge Temperance Temperance patience patience godliness godl brotherly kindness brotherly kindness charity which is love if these things be in you and abound they make you that you shall neither be baren or unfruitful the all of our Lord Jesus Christ watch what he says next now Peter is outlining something here for us that how to what how to get it how to get there Peter is outlining something here for us that how to get there all right so that's why I said Wednesday night and I hope I didn't offend people but see that's this is old news because Peter had it Peter had it working in his life every day working in his Fish Department or whatever it is you know and and all he he had these virtues working in his life right and Peter there's no way Peter could tell us how to get there unless Peter had it right now I want to say this that there are some people who have a portion of this virtue and all this wisdom patience and so forth that don't even Pro profess to be Christians now we just were teaching Sunday school and that's true there's some people that have a portion of this that don't even pretend to be Christian but that doesn't that won't do it it's like a black bird trying to put peacock feathers in his wings to make him a peacock he only disgraces himself see that you only make a disgrace out of yourself when you don't do what God tells you to do and and it's so obvious um and I'm sorry that's just the way it is it's just obvious you you prove who you are be better just to stay the Blackbird when he tries to exercise these things without being a Christian he's just simply all out of place all right like a sycamore tree trying to manufacture apple apple it can't do it although it's a tree but it can't manufacture apples like a mu trying to manufacture wool trying to be a sheep when he's a mu see he can't manufacture wool he can't do it wool is a gift to a sheep these are gifts to the individual not to a m all right well I can eat like a sheep I can do this like a sheep and no matter what you can do you've got to be a sheep in order to have wool let me stop here a minute the Sheep doesn't manufacture wool he has wool because he is a sheep a lot of people trying to say well I'll try to get good see that's what I don't want us to do we say well I'll just try to get good you can't do that sheep doesn't it isn't asked isn't isn't expected to manufacture wo it Bears wo and it does it because the sheep and when you're a Christian you just bear the fruit of the spirit you don't manufacture it you don't try to make it up you try don't make yourself something you're not that's why the brother Dell always says I I wish to God I could make everybody unbelievers cuz we get a thing in our mind that we're a Believer cuz we've been in the is 37 years and we do this what's I got to do with it it's this right here it comes right down to your life amen and you're the only one that's with you 24/7 you and God so don't think you're fooling anybody you're sure not fooling God Don't Make yourself something that you're not you just become what you're supposed to be then it takes care of itself if you heard people say well I I've joined church I really ought to quit this line you're trying trying to manufacture something again you can't do it so there's no need of trying no more than a mule can make himself have wool he can't do it now that's what he's talking about manufacturing Christianity what's going to happen is this is manifesting time we'll be we'll go now we'll finish up later or next Sunday somewhere along the line God's going to test your Born Again experience not for his purpose but for yours and if you're not you you know what then that's good because you know what God's calling you at least he at least he's trying to get you to see something he's yeah if it bothers you then it's God trying to call you into the family it take it an honor that God's bothering you about your new birth because you know what if he's not then you're not a child you know I had a question that if these things are right it talks about the knowledge God right but these things be in you and abound those things to be in yes abounding in you not bouncing good thing bu but what you would be bountiful in the knowledge of oh yeah camera I'm leave it
