[34:50] tomorrow from Jamaica she went and had a

[34:55] he's having some R&R too so I think he
[35:00] might be in joint he might be enjoying
[35:02] it more cheese anyway good to be in the
[35:05] house of Lord good happen every one of
[35:08] you Willis you got your Bibles turn to
[35:11] Revelation six or you can watch it on
[35:13] the screen but I want to cover this
[35:16] pretty quick I want to cover something
[35:18] at the end to maybe add a little bit to
[35:20] what brother Dale was talking about this
[35:23] morning so if that's all right because
[35:26] it all pertains to the seals and the
[35:28] Jews and it all pertains to us God nuts
[35:31] and the Jews well although it's a plan
[35:32] of redemption it's covered in all this
[35:35] so also by the way of announcement
[35:37] remember next Sunday we will have our
[35:42] we'll talk about officers and things
[35:44] like that just for the home folks and
[35:46] that will be I'll cut second service
[35:49] really short and then we'll just that
[35:51] way you won't have to stay over so much
[35:53] too
[35:56] ad service to a service so I also
[35:58] remember Bible studies next this coming
[36:00] Saturday and on marks the seventh which
[36:02] will be Thursday I'll be leaving for the
[36:05] Philippines toolmarks and 19th we've got
[36:07] our itinerary it is very tight so we got
[36:12] a lot to do in 14 days and two of those
[36:15] days with travel days so just keep us in
[36:17] your prayers also brother Jule there was
[36:20] a text sent out from I guess from sister
[36:23] Forney or the girl but he's gonna have
[36:27] to spend two days in the hospital
[36:30] everything's clearing up so thank God
[36:32] for that he told him he couldn't stay
[36:35] two days in the hospital without
[36:36] chickens so so he's fine he's okay but
[36:42] thank god we've the prayers of the
[36:44] saints I tell you you know you you get
[36:46] somebody like brother Julian aids not
[36:48] but one of him and man will you want to
[36:50] keep that guy you want God to protect
[36:53] that and but now remember on the flip
[36:54] side the Satan wants to get rid of it so
[36:57] we've got to keep him covered under that
[36:59] blood and and and remember his blood cuz
[37:03] this is blood pressure and his heart
[37:04] rate and things like that they're giving
[37:06] him some blood thinners to try to get
[37:07] his heart rate back down so uh but yeah
[37:09] he was cutting up he was wanting some
[37:10] couldn't go two days like chicken I've
[37:12] seen him on the message back later and
[37:14] told him I said I'll bring you some
[37:16] chicken if you need something we have to
[37:17] steal it and sneak it in I don't think
[37:21] they put it in the IV bags yet you can't
[37:23] get a chicken leg through the IV so he
[37:27] might want to try though he'd try
[37:30] anything if he goes two days without
[37:31] chicken he'd be sicker than he was when
[37:33] he went in the hospital so good to be in
[37:35] the house of the Lord good to have
[37:38] brother Russ with us and most of you
[37:39] know who he's is but who he is but the
[37:41] ones that don't know he's from Minnesota
[37:43] and that spelled with a s OD a on the
[37:46] end of it not Minnesota Minnesota ah
[37:49] he's from he's from Minnesota uh okay he
[37:56] just came from eleven inches of snow so
[37:58] coming down here as a culture shock for
[38:01] him I checked the temperatures like
[38:03] fifteen degrees up there mmm you're
[38:05] going back okay
[38:07] sixty down here and
[38:09] Steen in his house so they just remember
[38:12] also brother Chris long he sent me a
[38:14] picture eight feet drift 41 inches of
[38:20] snow in 24 hours is the most I've ever
[38:22] had in a 24-hour period nice 41 inches
[38:24] of snow plus eight foot drifts he sent
[38:28] me a picture of place where he's got his
[38:29] car and you it's almost up to the top of
[38:32] the car thing that you'd like a little
[38:34] portable carport so then he sent me
[38:37] another one of him standing outside and
[38:39] you can see the stop sign and the stop
[38:42] signs here and the snows about that far
[38:45] below the stop sign piled up so and that
[38:49] wasn't the drift that was the real thing
[38:51] so just remember them in your prayers
[38:53] cuz mm-hmm they're not gonna be getting
[38:55] out for a little while it's kind of hard
[38:57] to shovel that kind of snow with showin
[38:59] if you like brother Russ he's got an 80
[39:00] horsepower track hoe bobcat and he just
[39:06] pushes everything out of the way you
[39:07] know so so that's the and it's heated
[39:10] and air conditioned so he doesn't have
[39:11] to get cold but bless his heart also
[39:15] remember on April the 13th put this down

[41:31] sixth seal although there was a great
[41:32] earthquake and the Sun became black as
[41:34] sackcloth of hair and the moon became as
[41:36] blood and the stars of heaven fell unto
[41:38] the earth even as a fig tree casteth her
[41:40] untimely figs when she is shaken of a
[41:43] mighty wind and the heaven departed as a
[41:45] scroll when it rolled together and every
[41:46] mountain and Island were moved out of
[41:49] the places now remember this is all
[41:50] natural things it's not human beings
[41:53] involved in this except except they get
[41:56] they get the bad part all right ok so it
[42:01] and we're going to get to that because I
[42:03] don't know I don't think brother Dale
[42:05] told you that but the Jubilee year
[42:06] that's what we're looking at the Jubilee
[42:09] that's what we're heading toward the two
[42:10] prophets are gonna ring in that Jubilee
[42:12] year that the Jubilee year was just for
[42:15] the land sure people went went free but
[42:18] that was for the land to rest so the
[42:22] Jubilee is for the land not the earth
[42:28] this land to rest
[42:30] we're going to have a thousand years of
[42:33] Jubilee rest time
[42:35] with time still going on and Israel is
[42:38] gonna celebrate their Jubilee and the
[42:41] lands gonna rest
[42:42] this land is gonna rest that all right
[42:44] amen
[42:45] we'll get to it maybe in just a minute
[42:47] the kings of the earth heaven departed
[42:49] as a scroll that was rolled together and
[42:51] every mountain and Island were moved out
[42:53] of their places the kings of the earth
[42:55] and the great men the rich men the chief
[42:56] captains and the mighty men and every
[42:58] bondman and every free man hid
[43:00] themselves in the dens and in the rocks
[43:01] of the mountains I said to the mountains
[43:03] and rocks fall on us and hide us from
[43:05] the face of him that sitteth on the
[43:06] throne and from the wrath of the lamb
[43:08] for the great day of his wrath is come
[43:12] and who shall be able to stand you may

[45:36] cover as we were talking last night when
[45:38] we get into the part of our part of the
[45:41] sixth seal it's going to be something
[45:44] that's never happened before
[45:47] and when we leave there's gonna be
[45:49] happened because the Bible says man
[45:51] ain't gonna be able to - even you can
[45:53] realize what's gonna happen the chaos
[45:55] that's gonna happen after we leave this
[45:57] place amen
[45:58] well you can't believe the chaos that's
[46:00] gonna happen to this guy before we leave
[46:02] this place because something's got to
[46:03] happen that no one on earth has ever
[46:05] done there has never a born-again
[46:08] believer stood on the earth and did not
[46:11] have to die to take a body change even
[46:16] Jesus had to die everybody's had to die
[46:20] but there's somebody gonna be on this
[46:22] earth that his nature is going to be so
[46:25] disrupted or interrupted that there's
[46:28] going to be so abnormal but yet it's
[46:32] going to happen it's a promise that's
[46:34] going to happen so we know it's going to
[46:35] happen but you and I must get
[46:38] because remember six seals finishes
[46:41] Redemption what we were talking about
[46:42] the other day all right six seals set
[46:45] finished or did you say well once -
[46:46] seven there's nothing it's silence
[46:48] there's nobody moving there's no there's
[46:51] no player there's no there's no you know
[46:54] moon and sun and you see all these other
[46:57] things there's a set up in the play in
[47:00] the acts of a play there's always a
[47:01] backdrop there's always props Seventh
[47:04] Seal silence silence in heaven for space
[47:08] of a half an hour silence nothing
[47:09] nothing moving brother Brahim said
[47:11] nothing going on so what is we're get to
[47:15] the Seventh Seal maybe when we get back
[47:17] from the Philippines
[47:19] the Seventh Seal is what takes this book
[47:24] remembering revelations 5mm takes the
[47:28] book what's the book it's not the Bible
[47:31] it's a book of names your name brother
[47:35] Brown said one time he said John saw his
[47:37] name in the book what book the book that
[47:40] the father had on the throne in his hand
[47:43] while this seventh seal Son of Man made
[47:48] his intercessory work in the church ages
[47:51] then when that's over with he comes and
[47:55] takes the sixth seal book and redeems it
[47:58] takes possession because remember the
[48:01] Lamb of God is not the son of God in
[48:02] that part that's the Son of Man the Son
[48:07] of Man is the Lamb that's the flesh God
[48:10] all right we were talking about that
[48:12] this morning a little bit in the
[48:13] sunday-school class we're into the book
[48:15] of Hebrews now we finished with Roman so
[48:17] we're in the book of Hebrews and man the
[48:19] first we can't get past three verses in
[48:21] 45 minutes so I I would ask you to maybe
[48:26] look at that and see because I've always
[48:29] said Satan loves to keep what keep us
[48:32] separated divide and conquer he does not
[48:36] want you to realize that you're God
[48:38] Almighty in human flesh he don't worry
[48:40] he doesn't want you to realize that
[48:42] because when the bride realizes who she
[48:45] is not who she's going to become it's
[48:48] not like that we're just going to become
[48:50] something no you already kernel is
[48:52] eternal is eternal you can't make
[48:54] eternal up here and eternal down here
[48:56] and degrees of eternal if you're born
[48:59] again today you're just as eternal as
[49:01] God is because you're not a second part
[49:04] of God you are God made manifest in
[49:07] another form called the bride God has
[49:10] decided to M morphe into you you say
[49:15] that's just
[49:15] radical if God decided it he makes no is
[49:19] it with me rest on my last no there's no
[49:22] God doesn't do something go not sure the
[49:24] don't that way you know we do that
[49:27] that's that's us all every day but God
[49:30] doesn't go something do something to go
[49:32] knock I shouldn't have done that
[49:33] Lord I look down brother calling there's
[49:36] a person under your seat I thought you
[49:37] had purse oh it's Rebecca Rebecca that's
[49:43] just Rebecca's first scared me there for
[49:47] a minute talking about pink and getting
[49:51] touch with your feminine side well
[49:54] that's alright Riley's been with us for
[50:00] behind me 150 years yes I'm I get set in
[50:03] the same place real solid guide in the
[50:06] church - I'm telling you real solid guy
[50:09] real solid brother but what was I told
[50:11] me God in him whatever you want me to
[50:16] talk about right but that six sealed
[50:18] book though is the is the seven churches
[50:22] because all this happens in the church
[50:24] ages even five and six then the
[50:27] spiritual part we get is still in the
[50:29] church ages thereby alright with that
[50:32] you got now the natural steel breaks
[50:35] when we leave we're not here when the
[50:37] state Steel Brakes natural seal but you
[50:40] and I are totally under the sixth seal
[50:43] for your body changed for the nature
[50:46] because you really you had a nature
[50:48] change when you got born again right the
[50:50] old nature is dead and you become alive
[50:53] in Christ well now that's that's the
[50:56] inside of the inside that's the soul all
[50:58] right
[50:59] that's the soul but now God is working
[51:01] on that spirit room because there was a
[51:02] spirit giving you which it became a
[51:04] fallen nature because you're in this
[51:08] fallen condition right amen and then
[51:14] your body must be under falling
[51:18] condition we sure are getting a lot
[51:20] older but remember if you're born again
[51:23] I tell sister Clete all the time she's
[51:26] 92 years 92 years old she's
[51:29] ninety-two years old but she doesn't
[51:30] look it and actually doesn't act it at
[51:32] all good everybody say a man doesn't act
[51:35] like it at all but she's closer to 20
[51:38] years old than we are you got a seat
[51:41] seat but now that's abnormal you know
[51:43] you told them that in Sunday school I'm
[51:45] working on a sermon what the world
[51:48] thinks it's normal we say is abnormal
[51:53] what we say is normal like that thinking
[51:56] that the world laughs look I can go
[51:59] idiot she's getting older know as a
[52:03] Christian she's getting younger we're
[52:05] heading toward a body change we're
[52:08] heading toward what's already inside of
[52:11] us that's the problem with the world the
[52:13] world this is not in my nose but the
[52:15] world can't see God but your God inside
[52:24] of you is a young person working in the
[52:28] auspice of the Word of God feeding on
[52:32] the Word of God listen when you go to
[52:33] McDonald's and eat you're not feeding
[52:35] your soul your feet amen brother
[52:40] then you're not feeding your soul here's
[52:45] where you feed your soul you're feeding
[52:48] this natural body so that it keeps the
[52:50] soul inside and that's kind of strange
[52:54] that's kind of strange that we're eating
[52:57] to try to keep this guy alive to keep
[52:59] the eternal part that's inside of us
[53:01] from leaving us I mean come on when I
[53:07] start doing things but look I mean that
[53:09] do you do you think that way the world
[53:12] don't the world don't that thinks we're
[53:15] crazy but we are every day heading
[53:19] toward a younger condition but now look
[53:22] we're not heading toward it we're in it
[53:25] thank you it's inside of us that's why
[53:29] me we're not looking for a theophany
[53:30] that's young out here and we're all over
[53:34] here that theophanies inside
[53:38] it can't do you any good standing over
[53:41] there but it's what's gonna change your
[53:43] body
[53:44] it's what's already inside of you what's
[53:46] gonna change you everything you need for
[53:48] your journey the prophet of God said is
[53:50] right there in you and that's what the
[53:55] seals I believe that's what the seals
[53:56] are telling us when we look at these two
[53:57] prophets these two prophets do what this
[54:00] morning we were talking this morning I
[54:04] read the scripture in John one I said in
[54:05] the beginning was rough in the beginning
[54:12] was the word and the Word was with God
[54:15] and the Word was God
[54:17] put your name in there because you are
[54:19] the Word made flesh aren't you verse 114
[54:23] says and the Word was made flesh oh that
[54:28] was Jesus okay at one time he fulfilled
[54:36] that but because he fulfilled that now
[54:39] you and I can fulfill that and the Word
[54:42] was made flesh and dwelt among us now we
[54:47] know that's talking about Jesus but you
[54:49] and I got to see that that same one as
[54:51] saying you didn't lose the title when he
[54:53] that same one that was walking on the
[54:55] shores of Galilee didn't lose the title
[54:57] when he went inside of you he's still
[55:01] God and when he went inside of you he
[55:04] didn't become a West regards what I'm
[55:06] trying to say he didn't become a lesser
[55:07] god no he became a greater God because
[55:11] that's exactly the way we're going back
[55:12] to we're getting back to that everybody
[55:14] all right well that same am all right so
[55:18] so when I say who's going to take a
[55:20] rapture and you say now that meant you
[55:23] said no you're exalting yourself be
[55:25] careful folks if God's inside of me who
[55:31] the minds open if you think this flesh
[55:34] is going to do it you're in trouble but
[55:38] if the one inside of me we let him do it
[55:42] but but you can't separate it ever again
[55:47] once he comes in and gets in your soul
[55:50] that's God and you together brother Ram
[55:52] said there's persons he said vulcanized
[55:55] what is vulcanized it's not rubbing and
[55:58] and cloth it's two pieces of cut on
[56:03] people it's two pieces of rubber that
[56:05] has you can't tell them apart that's
[56:10] what you you and God in your soul
[56:13] today bottling you birth it's not it's
[56:17] not plastic over here rust and rubber
[56:19] over here God now he didn't exchange her
[56:24] soul but he sure changed it to rubber so
[56:29] that when he comes that's why it takes
[56:31] the Holy Ghost and fire remember the old
[56:34] cubes you had to heat them tubes up
[56:36] right with what fire yeah you got oh
[56:41] yeah
[56:42] sorry darling you're right they might
[56:44] know even one up inner tube is some of
[56:46] young kids they go - energy every tire
[56:50] used to have an inner tube in it and
[56:52] that inner tube is what held them
[56:54] brother house laughing even the oldies
[56:56] that goes oh we fixed that many times
[56:59] cause you fix them at home but you know
[57:00] what you got to do first
[57:01] oh you don't just brush them no no I
[57:06] remember daddy had a little thing about
[57:08] that big and it was it had spines on it
[57:11] and you'd have to rough it up to make it
[57:14] rough hello
[57:15] he not the on Sunday and Wednesday he'd
[57:19] have to make it rough but he would
[57:21] roughing that up and then what you put a
[57:22] little glue then you take fire and you
[57:24] light it actually sometimes the glue
[57:26] would like ignite and light and that
[57:28] heated it up I'm just doing this for the
[57:30] kids because all your ones are doing
[57:31] this and the kids are going and then you
[57:34] would take a patch that was the same
[57:36] material God the same material and when
[57:43] you put it together like that it
[57:45] literally melted and it was stronger
[57:49] than anything around that tube Indian
[57:52] part of the other rubber because you had
[57:53] double rubber now that's being God we
[57:56] double rubber together you can quote me
[57:59] on that
[58:02] but that's what he done but see that's
[58:04] not patching it up that's making it past
[58:06] new because you got an old tube the rest
[58:10] of the tubes old but when you put that
[58:11] patch on it it's usually about that much
[58:13] thicker than the rest of the tire but
[58:15] you can't you know unless you just
[58:17] didn't do it right which god doesn't not
[58:19] do it right you might get a patch it
[58:22] comes off but most of the time the tires
[58:24] gonna blow somewhere else I'm telling
[58:27] this for a spiritual part too for the
[58:29] older ones there's another part that
[58:31] might blow out and you know but but most
[58:33] of the time but it was rubber and rubber
[58:35] you didn't go get a wood patch and put
[58:39] it on a rubber it won't balkanize but
[58:42] brother Branham says it vulcanize --is
[58:44] us together so why don't we believe that
[58:48] we're vulcanized with God and just let
[58:51] him do the work let go and let God we
[58:54] say that many many times but why don't
[58:56] we do that no we get down and we do like
[58:59] I do sometimes we try to do 1 plus 1 is
[59:01] 2 and 2 times 2 is forward and we try to
[59:04] figure it all out let's just listen to
[59:06] what God has for us cuz if he's inside
[59:08] of you he's the one that's gonna talk to
[59:09] you ok
[59:11] alright so in the but in the sales when
[59:13] we see this 6 sealed book of redemption
[59:15] for you and I and then we'll get to the
[59:17] ceiling just a second but that 6 sealed
[59:20] book of redemption that book is sealed
[59:22] with six seals now like brother Dale
[59:24] said Jesus already preached 6 seals
[59:27] they've already been preached the books
[59:30] already in other words the books already
[59:31] there your names already in that book
[59:34] but it takes the seventh seal which
[59:37] there's only one seal grieve not me bro
[59:40] remember when we first started this a
[59:41] year ago I read to you what a seal was
[59:43] the Bible says grieve not the Holy
[59:45] Spirit of God whereby you are until the
[59:48] day of your redemption that's the only
[59:49] seal there is because without the
[59:52] baptism of the Holy Ghost today without
[59:54] your soul being sealed in you cannot
[59:56] understand what I'm talking about oh you
[1:00:01] can get parts of it if you're not born
[1:00:04] again and it will bring you to a level
[1:00:06] to get born again but what I'm saying is
[1:00:08] is when you get to this seat up to the
[1:00:10] six seals you've got the whole book
[1:00:14] you're not just
[1:00:16] milk is telling them downstairs and I'll
[1:00:20] tell you I I'm not looking for the last
[1:00:22] seed to come in see there there's now
[1:00:30] now we're gonna be abnormal in the
[1:00:31] message register we're gonna be abnormal
[1:00:34] in the message now make sure people are
[1:00:35] gonna be going down what where's Bob
[1:00:37] black big what Oh Bob we'll say
[1:00:41] something you go do what he's off
[1:00:44] preaching for brother crocheting he's
[1:00:45] always way back home I'm sure so just
[1:00:46] pray for him I'm sure they had a good
[1:00:48] time but you come to a place though that
[1:00:51] that last seed cannot be a baby if we're
[1:00:53] gonna take a rapture that last one that
[1:00:57] everybody's looking for has got to be a
[1:00:59] mature person it can't be a baby so he's
[1:01:03] got to be taught he or she whoever has
[1:01:05] got to be taught the Word of God because
[1:01:07] God's not gonna rapture babies he
[1:01:10] raptures full-grown people especially if
[1:01:14] they're gonna take a body change they
[1:01:15] got to be fully mature so what I'm
[1:01:18] saying is we may have already got to
[1:01:20] last see that person may be sitting in a
[1:01:23] service one day somewhere no I don't
[1:01:27] have to be here but somewhere and what
[1:01:29] he moves up just a little bit higher he
[1:01:32] or she they move up just a little bit
[1:01:34] higher and then all of a sudden God says
[1:01:36] okay you're at the place where I can
[1:01:38] take them all now see so I look at it a
[1:01:41] little bit different to me that's
[1:01:42] abnormal to most what people thought
[1:01:43] people think like I said many times
[1:01:45] before I'm not looking and don't even I
[1:01:48] a rapture to me as an event we've got to
[1:01:52] have the dead come out of the ground
[1:01:54] first we've got to have a body change
[1:01:56] before the rapture so why is everybody
[1:01:58] I'm looking for a rapture that's an
[1:02:01] event on the calendar but you better be
[1:02:04] ready you got to get ready before that
[1:02:07] time comes I'm seeing the rapture no I
[1:02:11] want to see your body change because if
[1:02:13] I see in a rapture might mean I have to
[1:02:15] die hmm see what I mean I'm still
[1:02:20] working on some of these things that are
[1:02:22] kind of odd to us that we may have all
[1:02:25] these years you know you know for all
[1:02:26] these years they've said now now
[1:02:29] brother Gary Adkins he's passed on he's
[1:02:33] he's sitting at Jesus's feet walking on
[1:02:35] streets to go no that's not true that's
[1:02:39] not true but now how many times you've
[1:02:40] been told that your whole life basically
[1:02:43] man's denomination know if you've been
[1:02:44] in a mess but you in the denominational
[1:02:46] it's my mama's right there defeated you
[1:02:48] know she's not that's not true they're
[1:02:52] in the sixth dimension we know that
[1:02:54] they're in a very happy and a wonderful
[1:02:56] place but there's things gotta happen
[1:02:58] before all that comes to being you said
[1:03:00] well you just been too technical you're
[1:03:02] the one that's gonna have to make it
[1:03:04] come to pass
[1:03:05] you better if you won't want to get
[1:03:06] technical you better get technical cuz
[1:03:08] without you coming to a body change
[1:03:10] they're going to stay in that dimension
[1:03:15] okay all right I mean really it's
[1:03:20] wonderful to know these things but the
[1:03:22] present-day truth is what you're not
[1:03:24] that's why I am is gonna take a rapture
[1:03:27] but I am just gonna have to have a body
[1:03:29] change first so who's gonna take a body
[1:03:33] change you say I am well you hear this
[1:03:35] you that's not exalted that's not saying
[1:03:40] I'm gonna do this if you know the
[1:03:43] correct way it's God gonna do it but
[1:03:46] he's gonna do it through you and I
[1:03:49] didn't decide that he did I just
[1:03:52] accepted what he said what he's already
[1:03:55] saying amen
[1:04:00] so let's read let's read a few quotes
[1:04:02] we're gonna kind of kind of review just
[1:04:05] a second I'm gonna skip a bunch of this
[1:04:07] and then get to the to the end and then
[1:04:10] kind of bring something about did you
[1:04:11] believe that
[1:04:12] I think I'll help you understand more
[1:04:14] what brother nails tell me this morning
[1:04:16] number one is thick steel now the
[1:04:18] earthquake cuz listen folks this is for
[1:04:23] you this is for you
[1:04:26] all this is for you it's for it's for
[1:04:29] all of us to come to that place I don't
[1:04:32] want to be a prophet too right now and
[1:04:35] know what all you were thinking thank
[1:04:39] God
[1:04:41] and all of you are gonna say man you
[1:04:44] should not have think about what I just
[1:04:48] did
[1:04:49] okay anyway I just exposed ya hear no
[1:04:56] evil see no evil we can't help what we
[1:05:00] think we're human beings but we can do
[1:05:03] something about the thought that we have
[1:05:05] man even Jesus had I was telling him
[1:05:08] downstairs you know Jesus was around
[1:05:09] Mary Magdalene for years
[1:05:11] and she's the prostitute you don't think
[1:05:14] he saw things but remember he was clean
[1:05:18] he didn't have to have a statue of
[1:05:20] bourbon man he was the statue a perfect
[1:05:22] man but you know what he's told us the
[1:05:25] way to get to it it's not like we're
[1:05:27] putting him way up in we can't reach it
[1:05:30] no he's not that King came down here to
[1:05:34] live among us to teach us how to do that
[1:05:38] the stature of a perfect man that wasn't
[1:05:40] the statue of William Branham that was
[1:05:44] the statue of a perfect man Jesus Christ
[1:05:46] I love you go in brother just tremble
[1:05:50] we're used to preach or he's passed on
[1:05:52] now but he has a big picture of the
[1:05:56] cloud over here and remember the some of
[1:06:00] your old ones remember the picture in
[1:06:02] the indictment book where brother Brown
[1:06:04] was pointing his finger like this Ryan
[1:06:06] died this generation and it's a
[1:06:07] black-and-white picture of him standing
[1:06:09] to pulpit brother Jessica's got that
[1:06:11] picture of him doing this and the cloud
[1:06:14] and he's pointing to the cloud and he
[1:06:15] said a true prophet will point you to
[1:06:17] Christ every time and that's the way it
[1:06:20] is he pointed us to Christ that's why I
[1:06:23] don't I don't get muddled up and if
[1:06:26] brother Branham was right or wrong or he
[1:06:32] brought us the Word of God he was a
[1:06:35] prophet he was supposed to bring it to
[1:06:37] us he was supposed to leave the scene
[1:06:39] and he was given a commission to give it
[1:06:44] to a group of people and he did give it
[1:06:46] to us he did what he was supposed to do
[1:06:48] now what are we going to do about it is
[1:06:50] our business we can take it and forget
[1:06:53] it like a lot of people are doing or we
[1:06:55] take it and we can move it right on to
[1:06:57] the coming of the Lord
[1:06:58] compare Scripture this great event that
[1:07:00] we will see this great secret of mystery
[1:07:02] that was under the sixth seal of the
[1:07:04] book of Redemption so remember anytime
[1:07:05] you see a book that book in the Bible
[1:07:08] six seals has it sealed okay because
[1:07:13] look it's the sixth sealed book of
[1:07:14] redemption I'm reading what the prophet
[1:07:15] said now remember these are hidden
[1:07:17] mysteries and the six seals all together
[1:07:19] is one great big book just sit Scrolls
[1:07:23] roll together and it unwinds the whole
[1:07:25] book of redemption that's how the whole
[1:07:28] earth was redeemed and we'll get into
[1:07:30] revelations five later on about all that
[1:07:32] so let's go to number two all right now
[1:07:37] this six seal now what we're looking
[1:07:38] here look what is this keep not throw
[1:07:45] something at it so the Tribulation
[1:07:50] Period is here right after we leave so
[1:07:53] the sixth seal is the Tribulation Period
[1:07:55] the seal itself is the Tribulation
[1:07:58] Period all right that's what takes place
[1:08:00] the bride has gone no living creature in
[1:08:03] other words there's no holy ghost on the
[1:08:05] earth they said well it's going to fall
[1:08:06] in 144,000 and two now God's not dealing
[1:08:09] with the church no more it's done gone
[1:08:11] he's dealing with Israel this is the
[1:08:13] other side
[1:08:14] this is when Israel receives the message
[1:08:16] of the kingdom by the two problems of
[1:08:17] Revelations 11 remember their eyes are
[1:08:20] blind to today the Bible tells us that
[1:08:22] their eyes are literally blinded until
[1:08:24] we get out of here when we leave God
[1:08:26] will lift that veil off of their eyes
[1:08:28] and they'll see Christ through those two
[1:08:30] prophets so we're holding up the whole
[1:08:32] thing because we can't be here he can't
[1:08:36] have a bride here and then calls the
[1:08:39] tribulation to happen and then go to the
[1:08:43] Jews we got to be gone Joseph's wife
[1:08:45] Gentile wife was in the palace when he
[1:08:47] revealed himself to his brethren the
[1:08:51] Jews
[1:08:51] remember he married him he married a
[1:08:54] girl in Egypt right while he was down
[1:08:56] there and but he sent that Gentile wife
[1:08:58] back to the palace when he revealed
[1:09:01] itself same thing with God revealing
[1:09:04] himself to the Jews we must be out of
[1:09:06] here we must leave this place
[1:09:09] we cannot be here when he goes to the
[1:09:11] Jews remember Israel is a nation God's
[1:09:15] servant nation to win when Israel is
[1:09:17] brought in it'll be a national affair
[1:09:19] Israel the kingdom age is when David the
[1:09:21] son of David sits on the throne I'll
[1:09:24] keep that in your mind just for a minute
[1:09:25] all right let's go to number three go
[1:09:27] through this real quick I want to skip a
[1:09:29] few things well we know the six seals of
[1:09:34] judgement seal because even remember
[1:09:36] look at me just a minute even the even
[1:09:40] the foolish virgin we were talking about
[1:09:41] this life even the foolish virgin has to
[1:09:43] go through this time of judgment right
[1:09:46] they're not born again they may be
[1:09:49] totally justified they may be totally
[1:09:51] sanctified but either some preacher
[1:09:54] blinded their eyes or something happen
[1:09:56] that they didn't get the Holy Ghost okay
[1:09:59] that's why you have to really know you
[1:10:01] got a Holy Ghost filled preacher because
[1:10:03] you can only go as high as your pastor
[1:10:06] you should whole ever passes born-again
[1:10:11] hold on what's this know everywhere I
[1:10:18] like what brother Russ said he said you
[1:10:20] know he said the devil's got a file full
[1:10:22] ministry - you ever thought about that
[1:10:25] he's a copycat right he's a copycat
[1:10:28] if God's got five true file it's got
[1:10:31] five fold ministry that's true Satan's
[1:10:33] got listen if you preach false doctrine
[1:10:36] that's not God that's just beer you know
[1:10:39] that's not God but he does have a true
[1:10:44] fivefold ministry because he said it
[1:10:45] would perfect the Saints so I'm going to
[1:10:47] go with take the Bible what the Bible
[1:10:48] said about it alright well we know the
[1:10:50] state sells a judgment seal so they're
[1:10:53] going to get their judgment while we're
[1:10:54] gone so you and I hallelujah I told you
[1:10:57] I said what great revelation is that we
[1:10:59] don't have to go through this the brides
[1:11:02] gone we're out of here before this
[1:11:05] starts you think we're having judgment
[1:11:07] now go home and look in refrigerator
[1:11:09] yeah it's bad job
[1:11:11] go get in your $80,000 car and go the
[1:11:13] house might show heated seats and you
[1:11:15] heat it staring well boy we're going
[1:11:17] through some birds ignition yeah thing
[1:11:19] no you don't want to be here when this
[1:11:22] happened
[1:11:23] now here's the breaking fourth of the
[1:11:25] judgment upon the people we're out of
[1:11:28] this tribulation judgment will come
[1:11:30] forth 144,000 redeemed Jews now remember
[1:11:33] God will not speak and we'll get into
[1:11:36] this maybe if I have time to read one of
[1:11:40] the reasons they've never celebrated a
[1:11:42] Jubilee year it's because they've never
[1:11:43] all been in the homeland you cannot
[1:11:47] remember I told you it was land during a
[1:11:49] Jubilee a year the land has to rest with
[1:11:52] the people all of I'll read it to you
[1:11:54] all of Israel all 12 tribes have to be
[1:11:58] in Jerusalem before letting celebrated
[1:12:01] Jubilee here so what's gonna happen in
[1:12:04] the Millennium all twelve tribes are
[1:12:08] coming together well this is perfect I
[1:12:12] mean it really just helps a lot to just
[1:12:13] keep digging and keep reading and see
[1:12:15] how God's gonna do this thing here's the
[1:12:18] breaking forth of the judgment upon the
[1:12:19] people
[1:12:19] they'll come forth 144,000 redeemed Jews
[1:12:23] I'll prove it to you they're Jews are
[1:12:24] not Gentiles they have nothing to do
[1:12:26] with the bride not a thing see what like
[1:12:29] we were talking about we done seen the
[1:12:31] bride gone you can't place that else
[1:12:34] anywhere else
[1:12:35] don't come back into the nineteenth
[1:12:36] chapter of the book of would no less for
[1:12:37] a book of revelations for the sick cells
[1:12:39] of judgment still the word but you have
[1:12:42] to remember to like we were talking
[1:12:45] about things that were told week in most
[1:12:47] denominations
[1:12:49] they've everybody seen the movie left
[1:12:52] behind you've seen the movie left behind
[1:12:56] okay well what if you hadn't seen the
[1:12:58] movie left behind that's what it means
[1:13:00] that means there's a rapture already
[1:13:02] took place and you're left behind but
[1:13:03] you can get saved after you've been left
[1:13:05] behind because the denominational world
[1:13:08] says there's a seven-year tribulation
[1:13:10] period ask brother Dale he'll tell you
[1:13:14] the Baptist believed there's three and a
[1:13:15] half year minor tribulation and three
[1:13:18] and a half years of major tribulation
[1:13:19] and you can make it through the minor
[1:13:21] tribulation if you're not whatever they
[1:13:25] call it but I told him I said the
[1:13:28] Antichrist shows up at the end of the
[1:13:30] movie I said no the Antichrist started
[1:13:32] in the first of the movie to tell them
[1:13:34] people that they were okay if there
[1:13:36] hey if we miss the first one you'll get
[1:13:38] the second one no you're not
[1:13:39] because remember the second resurrection
[1:13:42] after that it's judgement resurrection
[1:13:45] everybody raises at that time you want
[1:13:48] to be in the blessed are those that come
[1:13:51] in the first resurrection that doesn't
[1:13:53] have part in the second the second is is
[1:13:56] after the thousand years everybody comes
[1:13:58] up for judgment you don't want to be in
[1:14:00] that one but see how see how the devil
[1:14:02] has taught that doctrine in the
[1:14:04] denominational Church so they're not so
[1:14:06] you and I or should be so on edge to
[1:14:09] make the body change so on edge to make
[1:14:12] a resurrection but if you were in the
[1:14:15] denominational world you kind of got a
[1:14:17] little leeway if you don't make right is
[1:14:20] it right it's not and he's been going
[1:14:22] through this trying to talk to some of
[1:14:24] the nomination people well you know it
[1:14:25] ain't such a big deal because if I miss
[1:14:28] the first one I'll just make the second
[1:14:30] one no you missed the first one
[1:14:36] you think he'll it's gonna be bad you
[1:14:40] won't be alive on the earth when all
[1:14:41] these things happen and anything going
[1:14:42] to be good but the sixth seal is a
[1:14:44] judgment seal of the word of God
[1:14:47] all right revelations 11 I'm just gonna
[1:14:51] paraphrase it because we know what it is
[1:14:53] we know it's two prophets prophesy 1260
[1:14:56] days is that all right we should know
[1:14:58] that and it's the and it's the Ministry
[1:15:00] of Moses and Elijah because they shut up
[1:15:02] the heaven that it rain not in the days
[1:15:04] of their prophecy which is three and a
[1:15:05] half years same way with Elijah and
[1:15:07] water turned to blood we know that Moses
[1:15:10] did that to the Nile River what a stink
[1:15:12] oh you think that was horrible to smell
[1:15:14] that and it's not to earth with all
[1:15:15] plagues as often as they will all right
[1:15:17] and then they're gonna be killed and
[1:15:19] then they're gonna be caught up in a
[1:15:20] resurrection thereby okay with that
[1:15:22] don't have to read it
[1:15:23] number four excuse me we're still in the
[1:15:29] sixth seal what can bring these things
[1:15:33] by the word they can do nature any way
[1:15:37] they want here it is they're the one who
[1:15:38] brings on this sixth seal they uncover
[1:15:41] and open it up he's talked about the two
[1:15:43] prophets it's the power of God to
[1:15:46] interrupt nature see the sixth seal is
[1:15:48] completely and then
[1:15:49] corruption of nature so it's totally
[1:15:51] abnormal normal is what we're dealing
[1:15:57] with but that's totally abnormal when
[1:15:59] you've got two men standing there and
[1:16:01] all of a sudden like I said the Mossad
[1:16:03] comes to bring an army to destroy him
[1:16:05] and they just go ground open up swallow
[1:16:07] them up and you know and it's done
[1:16:09] they're gone this others they try to
[1:16:12] poison them they set their dream to
[1:16:13] gallons and it doesn't bother him
[1:16:15] they can't kill them till them 1260 days
[1:16:17] is over with which I said normal to the
[1:16:20] world but if they just read the Bible
[1:16:22] they'd be really normal them two
[1:16:24] prophets are not gonna die for 1260 days
[1:16:26] I don't care what you try to do to the
[1:16:30] sea Satan Satan Satan reads that and he
[1:16:33] don't believe it he just don't believe
[1:16:35] it if he believed it he said I'm just
[1:16:38] done I'm finished you know I'm this is
[1:16:40] that do you get it there's your seal so
[1:16:43] now there's your seal we're gonna talk
[1:16:44] about that today and then we'll move on
[1:16:45] to the seal compared to us next Sunday
[1:16:48] for a little while but this is the seal
[1:16:51] the seal is those two prophets on the
[1:16:53] other side of the rapture and as we've
[1:16:56] said before it took a profit on this
[1:16:58] side of the rapture brother branham it
[1:17:01] took a profit on this time of the
[1:17:03] rapture to tell us these things he
[1:17:05] prophesied of what was coming
[1:17:07] but to word together with the power of
[1:17:10] God the Word of God they just condemned
[1:17:12] nature they can send earthquakes turn
[1:17:14] the moon to blood Sun can go down
[1:17:16] anytime at their command amen there you
[1:17:18] are there you are see how the seals
[1:17:20] opened down there in the church age how
[1:17:22] it showed the martyrs
[1:17:23] now here's these two prophets standing
[1:17:26] here with the Word of God to do anything
[1:17:27] to nature they want to do and they shake
[1:17:31] the earth it shows exactly you does it
[1:17:34] Moses and Elijah cuz their ministry
[1:17:36] impersonated both men oh my do you see
[1:17:38] it see what the sixth seal is it's those
[1:17:41] two prophets now notice don't let it
[1:17:44] choked you but watch what happens open
[1:17:46] that seal prophets there you are over
[1:17:49] living in the eagle day brother hit him
[1:17:50] up the clouds they open that sixth seal
[1:17:52] they have power to do it there's your
[1:17:55] sixth seal coming open if you'll notice
[1:17:56] if you've read your sixth seal brother
[1:17:58] brother said I had to get up and walk
[1:18:00] out of the room something struck me what
[1:18:01] was it that struck him
[1:18:03] he noticed what he was doing it took a
[1:18:07] profit to open the seal it takes two
[1:18:10] prophets to open the sixth seal after
[1:18:12] we're gone but it took a profit in the
[1:18:14] end time to a Gentile Church to get us
[1:18:17] to see the spiritual part of the seal so
[1:18:19] that you and I can have an interruption
[1:18:21] of nature our nature and that we can be
[1:18:23] changed and be taken in the rapture and
[1:18:25] this doesn't apply to us
[1:18:28] this does not apply we're not going to
[1:18:30] be here all right
[1:18:32] this is this is part of the cleaning up
[1:18:34] of the earth all right let's go to then
[1:18:37] we're going to Daniel
[1:18:38] remember last 1994 laughs Russ kind of
[1:18:43] got onto me for being so would you say
[1:18:46] been so adamant about what I was talking
[1:18:48] about about this well I'm telling you
[1:18:50] here we go with normal abnormal in the
[1:18:53] message mode people in the message
[1:18:54] believe that doesn't only three and a
[1:18:55] half years left of the day and seven
[1:18:57] weeks at the end after the rapture but
[1:18:59] that is not true that's a lot the Bible
[1:19:04] says there's a seven years left so you
[1:19:07] go are you with the Bible I'm just gonna
[1:19:09] let you go you bring me any quote you
[1:19:10] want to normal senior right back to the
[1:19:12] Bible then okay that's been if that's
[1:19:15] been dogmatic that's okay I'll take the
[1:19:18] word any day any day I'll take what the
[1:19:21] word says over what anybody says but
[1:19:24] right here answers your question daddy
[1:19:25] told me that's many many years ago he
[1:19:27] said read if you don't understand I'm
[1:19:29] sending each read the six full purpose
[1:19:32] 70 weeks are determined seventy weeks
[1:19:35] are determined upon thy people and the
[1:19:40] city see our problem is we stop with the
[1:19:42] people but that city's got to be rebuilt
[1:19:46] hey man the city's got to be rebuilt to
[1:19:51] do six things finish the transgression
[1:19:54] not of the city of the people make an
[1:19:59] end of sins to the people not to the
[1:20:01] city to make reconciliation for iniquity
[1:20:04] now it says to bring in everlasting
[1:20:07] righteousness we're gonna bring it into
[1:20:11] the city seal up the vision and prophecy
[1:20:15] we're going to be right
[1:20:17] the north among so we're gonna be right
[1:20:18] there in that city and to anoint the
[1:20:21] most holy brother Brown said the most
[1:20:22] holy is us in the city so wait a minute
[1:20:28] seventy weeks has them this is all of it
[1:20:33] right here
[1:20:33] seventy weeks are determined not sixty
[1:20:38] nine and a half so the three and a half
[1:20:42] year your ministry of the prophets take
[1:20:44] you this red right here and then the
[1:20:47] last half I've told you many times
[1:20:49] before you can't bring in everlasting
[1:20:50] righteousness goes if you say as most
[1:20:54] people in the message say that after the
[1:20:56] 1260 days the Daniel seventy weeks is
[1:20:59] over that's not according to this
[1:21:01] because you stop it right here all right
[1:21:05] you stop it right here these other three
[1:21:08] has got to happen inside that seventy
[1:21:11] weeks so to north the most holy which is
[1:21:14] us into the Millennial temple there's
[1:21:17] got to be more time left after everybody
[1:21:19] thinks it's supposed to end right so
[1:21:22] there's seven years left after the
[1:21:24] rapture but there's only three and a
[1:21:26] half years of Jesus's ministry left I
[1:21:28] explained that the other day there was
[1:21:31] three and a half over here when when
[1:21:33] Jesus walked on the earth right pay
[1:21:36] attention to this
[1:21:37] there was three and a half to the
[1:21:38] prophets two prophets right let me do
[1:21:42] three-and-a-half all right got that now
[1:21:46] what is that that means that a seven
[1:21:50] seven two weeks equals seven years
[1:21:52] brother branham compiled all of the
[1:21:54] seventy weeks of Daniel in that three
[1:21:58] and a half years of ministry of Jesus
[1:21:59] when he was on earth and three and a
[1:22:01] half year ministry to the two witnesses
[1:22:04] all right right 1260 days over here 1260
[1:22:09] days over here that's all that's left
[1:22:12] amen and when did they show up the last
[1:22:14] half of that week he's talking about the
[1:22:17] Messiah week he always calls it the
[1:22:19] Messiah week but you can't take away
[1:22:23] what the Bible said there's one week
[1:22:25] left after the rapture and even the last
[1:22:28] sermon he preached was not the 70 weeks
[1:22:30] of Daniel it was the 70th week that
[1:22:33] whole sermon that lasts of the three
[1:22:35] books he preached read your title it
[1:22:37] says the 70th week not - not this half
[1:22:42] of half of the 70th week I'm telling you
[1:22:46] you just not getting what he's talking
[1:22:47] about everybody thinks that he changed
[1:22:50] it in the seals he never changed nothing
[1:22:52] in the seals he said I told you always
[1:22:54] gonna have to get rid of this before we
[1:22:55] got to it
[1:22:56] so if you got a problem go back to the
[1:23:00] Bible I'm just gonna start telling you
[1:23:01] to read what the Bible says and he shall
[1:23:03] make a comfort he will shall confirm the
[1:23:05] covenant with many for one week that's
[1:23:06] after we're gone that's right here for
[1:23:09] how long one week all right so there's
[1:23:12] one week left after the rapture there's
[1:23:14] only three and a half years of ministry
[1:23:15] there's only three and a half years of
[1:23:16] the tribulation but there's seven years
[1:23:18] left to get us into millennium because
[1:23:20] right here starts the millennium it
[1:23:23] doesn't start right here the millennium
[1:23:26] starts right here there by all right
[1:23:28] with that if you not then go back to the
[1:23:31] Bible all right so now let's skip number
[1:23:35] five let's read number six go to number
[1:23:38] six good good job feast of the trumpets
[1:23:41] now we got to get to the Feast of
[1:23:42] Trumpets Pentecost feast finishes at the
[1:23:44] period of the seventh trumpet for the
[1:23:47] next is the coming of the seventh seal
[1:23:49] for the next is the mystery of the
[1:23:51] coming of Christ and also the trumpet is
[1:23:52] sound for the Jews everybody settle down
[1:23:56] just a minute there sixth trumpet is
[1:23:59] sound and when it does it makes known to
[1:24:01] them the revealed Son of God now what
[1:24:03] happens after six seals are revealed to
[1:24:07] me and you what does it reveal Christ
[1:24:12] when their sixth when the sit when the
[1:24:15] trumpet sound the sixth this is the
[1:24:17] seven trumpets all I'm sound under the
[1:24:19] sixth seal well they all sound while
[1:24:22] these two prophets are known earth and
[1:24:24] we read them last Sunday they okay with
[1:24:30] it some of your
[1:24:38] their sixth trumpet is sound and when it
[1:24:41] does it makes known to them the reveal
[1:24:42] Son of God not the seventh because we're
[1:24:45] going to read next Sunday maybe we'll
[1:24:47] read the seventh trumpet the seventh
[1:24:49] trumpet to the Jews is the same as the
[1:24:50] seventh seal to us the kingdoms of our
[1:24:54] Lord have become the kingdoms of his
[1:24:56] Christ and we should rule and reign
[1:24:57] forever man because that happens because
[1:25:01] six seals finishes Redemption there's no
[1:25:03] more Redemption after the door closes
[1:25:07] there's the Redeemer but this is the
[1:25:12] Redemption he doesn't need to be
[1:25:15] redeemed not now his body did though
[1:25:22] Jesus his body was not eternal it had to
[1:25:25] be made eternal his body had to be
[1:25:28] redeemed I read you the quote where
[1:25:31] brother mom said that remember several
[1:25:33] months ago brother Brown said eternal
[1:25:35] life he inherited now Jesus Christ
[1:25:38] didn't inherit eternal life in his soul
[1:25:39] in the spirit we know that or he was
[1:25:42] just a mortal man but he inherited
[1:25:45] eternal life in his body
[1:25:47] when he come out of that tomb he said
[1:25:49] all power in heaven there's been given
[1:25:50] unto me that was redeemed body God so
[1:25:56] what's gonna happen to you same thing
[1:26:00] yes why we're we separated well they can
[1:26:04] happen to in Jesus but he can't happen
[1:26:05] to mean well you're in bad shape
[1:26:07] you're in bad shape hey he was garden he
[1:26:12] died but being gone and dying you don't
[1:26:16] have to die remember all trumpets sound
[1:26:20] on this sixth seal so all those trumpets
[1:26:22] we read last Sunday in Revelations 8 and
[1:26:24] 9 they sound while these two prophets
[1:26:27] are on the earth the sixth seal finishes
[1:26:31] the mystery under the sixth seal just
[1:26:33] before the seventh is open now this is
[1:26:36] piece of the trumpet he preached this
[1:26:38] after the seals so he knows what he's
[1:26:40] talking about just before the seventh is
[1:26:42] open all right there by ok with that
[1:26:44] then we read let's just not read the
[1:26:48] let's go to number seven that way we'll
[1:26:51] skip a lot of this for time go to number
[1:26:53] seven we read them last Sunday it's
[1:26:56] exactly the Tribulation Period you know
[1:26:58] what happened all the woes came and
[1:27:00] although the first Brethren brother Dale
[1:27:02] talked about this morning the first woe
[1:27:03] was first world war ii was the second
[1:27:05] world war and we hadn't had the third
[1:27:06] wheel yet because that's the third world
[1:27:07] war
[1:27:08] alright they're ok with that brother
[1:27:10] Brown said woes mean war alright now
[1:27:13] this calling of the Feast of Trumpets
[1:27:15] the approaching of something notice
[1:27:17] revelations 8 7 if you're gonna write it
[1:27:19] down we noticed the first trumpet
[1:27:21] they're scattered hail blood fire upon
[1:27:23] the earth just exactly with the Exodus
[1:27:26] you see what happen is what I told you
[1:27:27] this seal has been spoken of way back in
[1:27:30] the in in the Old Testament because the
[1:27:33] seals tie the entire Bible together so
[1:27:35] the the bringing of Israel out or the
[1:27:38] bringing of Israel out of the in the
[1:27:39] Exodus out of Egypt is exactly the same
[1:27:43] thing hail blood fire upon the earth
[1:27:46] just exactly the Exodus when God was
[1:27:49] calling his people out of the Exodus
[1:27:51] remember that was the first Exodus then
[1:27:54] now we're in the 3rd Exodus it's not
[1:27:56] going to be a coming out of Egypt as far
[1:27:58] as us all being in bondage not spiritual
[1:28:01] spiritual bondage is what we got to come
[1:28:04] out I I'd he'd rather be in natural
[1:28:06] bondage they've been spiritual bondage
[1:28:08] you say oh boy no I'd rather be in
[1:28:12] natural bondage then to being a
[1:28:14] spiritual bondage because that means
[1:28:17] you're bound now the reason that these
[1:28:19] seven trumpets does not apply to this
[1:28:21] church in this age is because it's to
[1:28:23] Israel only because we're Gentiles
[1:28:25] listen when when if there was a Gentile
[1:28:28] in Israel during these feast days they
[1:28:33] could come and watch but they couldn't
[1:28:35] participate Gentiles can't participate
[1:28:38] so we can't protect if those trumpets
[1:28:40] blew to Israel if you were a Gentile you
[1:28:43] just went what was that
[1:28:46] but the Jews knew exactly what that
[1:28:49] sound was because they were called under
[1:28:52] the Feast of the trumpets right so God
[1:28:55] is calling his people out of the exodus
[1:28:57] now the reason that these seven trumpets
[1:28:59] don't apply to this church and the ages
[1:29:01] because it's the Israel
[1:29:02] it's the calling of the gathering of the
[1:29:04] people now there's only one significance
[1:29:07] in here that I want you to get to in a
[1:29:08] few minutes
[1:29:09] it's where you'll see why this doesn't
[1:29:11] apply to this age that we're living the
[1:29:13] seven trumpets remember he started
[1:29:15] talking about he wanted to preach the
[1:29:16] trumpets and God wouldn't let him why
[1:29:17] because it's not to us nice to the Jews
[1:29:20] the gathering of Israel is the trumpets
[1:29:22] the trumpets is together Israel notice
[1:29:25] the very first trumpet sound blood fire
[1:29:27] hail everything scattered the ground
[1:29:28] Seif what was he doing bring Israel out
[1:29:30] of spiritually back into his
[1:29:32] homeland now let us say this here that
[1:29:35] even that every trumpet that blowed
[1:29:37] blown under the sixth seal so they're
[1:29:39] all going to blow at the time of that
[1:29:42] three-and-a-half year ministry of the
[1:29:44] two prophets because they are the seal
[1:29:46] and all trumpets sound of the sixth seal
[1:29:50] we'll get to in a few minutes where we
[1:29:52] caught the seal there all the trumpets
[1:29:53] sounded under the sixth seal thereby all
[1:29:56] right now look number eight then we'll
[1:30:01] get into kind of what brother Dale was
[1:30:02] telling us this morning now notice the
[1:30:03] trumpet sounded and that was to gather
[1:30:05] them together now the first trumpet
[1:30:07] blows there was Hellfire sprayed on the
[1:30:09] earth just exactly like it was in Egypt
[1:30:10] making ready to call them to the Day of
[1:30:12] Atonement they were calling them to the
[1:30:15] day of atonement
[1:30:16] all right everybody got that now
[1:30:20] remember the day of atonement was not
[1:30:22] the Passover the Passover is the killing
[1:30:26] of the Lamb the day of atonement was to
[1:30:30] separate yourself and and realize that
[1:30:32] something had already been killed in
[1:30:35] your stead and you were having a day to
[1:30:37] where you were honoring that all right
[1:30:39] because remember Israel has not come to
[1:30:43] their Day of Atonement yet so Crocs
[1:30:47] don't have to go get back on the cross
[1:30:48] it's not the it's not the the feast of
[1:30:50] Passover and then they're looking at the
[1:30:54] feast of atonement which they're going
[1:30:55] to say he already died you already
[1:30:58] killed that lamb in your country amen
[1:31:02] they rejected the true atonement and
[1:31:05] this year has been lengthened out
[1:31:07] through here has been the year Pentecost
[1:31:09] now look this has been the year of
[1:31:11] Pentecost actually the literal day of
[1:31:13] Pentecost is when the Holy Ghost fell
[1:31:15] the literal day of Pentecost the
[1:31:18] fiftieth day and we've been living to a
[1:31:22] degree under that because we've all had
[1:31:24] a Pentecost but now at the end we go to
[1:31:30] the Feast of Tabernacles cause
[1:31:32] Tabernacles is in gathering it's
[1:31:34] bringing everybody together amen
[1:31:38] so we're reading just a second these
[1:31:41] years has been lengthen out through here
[1:31:43] and it's been the year of Pentecost
[1:31:44] now look see Israel that's never had a
[1:31:46] day of Pentecost they've never received
[1:31:50] the Holy Ghost now they had a day of
[1:31:52] Pentecost their day where they do
[1:31:55] whatever do you know actually the
[1:31:58] Pentecost feast of Pentecost is called
[1:32:01] the feast of weeks because it's seven
[1:32:05] sevens is 49 and then the extra day is
[1:32:09] there 50 it's called the feast of weeks
[1:32:12] look it up in your in your in your
[1:32:15] history it's not in the Bible it does
[1:32:16] say feast of weeks in the Bible but it
[1:32:18] is to feast Pentecost call this 49 plus
[1:32:22] 1 makes 50 we'll get to that in just a
[1:32:24] second because we've come to our fifty
[1:32:27] when you get born again you're not in a
[1:32:29] 49 you're at a fifty you have come to
[1:32:33] your Jubilee year we just haven't
[1:32:37] finished it yet because this thing
[1:32:39] hasn't gone free yet but we're getting
[1:32:42] to it we're actually in it we're in it
[1:32:45] this has been the calling out of the
[1:32:48] church what those years of the Feast of
[1:32:50] Pentecost is where he called the people
[1:32:51] out the calling out feast of weeks seven
[1:32:55] look at me seven times seven forty-nine
[1:32:58] Church ages ages but you and I have to
[1:33:04] come to a fifty all right no I'll prove
[1:33:09] that team just second now then the
[1:33:11] calling out of the church watch real
[1:33:12] close now which afterwards he took them
[1:33:14] to the land of promise took him after
[1:33:17] what the moment they took him to land
[1:33:18] the promise which he will do the same
[1:33:21] thing which in symbol he takes the
[1:33:24] church see our land two promises the
[1:33:26] Word of God
[1:33:27] Israel's land of promise is that part
[1:33:30] over there past the Mediterranean Sea
[1:33:32] called brother rocks how many times
[1:33:34] you've been newsroom four times he's
[1:33:37] been over there that's where we're gonna
[1:33:39] live
[1:33:40] that's where we're gonna live that's
[1:33:43] where the city's gonna push you up from
[1:33:45] I feel we're gonna live but we're
[1:33:46] spiritual Israel natural Israel in two
[1:33:49] millenniums you live in the same place
[1:33:50] but then God's gonna wipe that all off
[1:33:52] again because that's temporal that's
[1:33:54] temporary because you and I are in a
[1:33:57] temporary dwelling place under 49
[1:34:02] that'll make you happy we're not have to
[1:34:06] be stuck in this thing
[1:34:08] thank you hallelujah brother I want to
[1:34:12] get you get you a megaphone when you say
[1:34:14] hallelujah I want brother Dick's hair to
[1:34:15] fall forward least he's got something
[1:34:20] don't all y'all laughs hmm woke up a
[1:34:29] little bit hey bite wait okay
[1:34:32] this has been the calling out of the
[1:34:34] church he's called us out during the
[1:34:36] feast of Pentecost we've all received
[1:34:38] the Holy Ghost Israel has not so they're
[1:34:42] not under that feast they're not in that
[1:34:44] 50 yet but they're gonna get it they're
[1:34:50] gonna get a natural time all right watch
[1:34:56] what number was that number eight number
[1:34:58] nine all right look no revelations now
[1:35:02] stick with me for just this 3:30 stick
[1:35:04] with me just a few minutes now
[1:35:06] revelation is the night 13th verse
[1:35:08] you'll notice real close under the sixth
[1:35:09] trumpet revelations 913 undeceive
[1:35:11] trumpet there was two hundred thousand
[1:35:13] horsemen it's actually two hundred
[1:35:15] thousand thousand we know that horsemen
[1:35:17] that had been bound in the river
[1:35:18] Euphrates was turned loose under the
[1:35:20] sixth trumpet now he goes to explain
[1:35:22] there's not that many literal horsemen
[1:35:24] in the world
[1:35:25] these are demons devils and like I said
[1:35:30] you know where there are they're right
[1:35:31] there that river Euphrates remember the
[1:35:33] Tigris and Euphrates River run right
[1:35:35] down through the Garden of Eden one bore
[1:35:37] on one side one on the other them demons
[1:35:41] with
[1:35:41] not let us back you thought about that
[1:35:45] them demons come out of that Tigris and
[1:35:47] you through the out of the Euphrates
[1:35:49] River to stop us from going across to
[1:35:52] the promised land there were two hundred
[1:35:54] thousand horsemen I want you to jot it
[1:35:55] down so he can read it they wasn't
[1:35:57] natural horses they breathe fire they
[1:35:58] had breastplates of Jasper and they had
[1:36:00] tails and and what was their tail it was
[1:36:03] alive it was their ta le not tal the end
[1:36:08] of the tail looked like a serpent a
[1:36:09] snake's head hello who tells a lie the
[1:36:12] serpent snakes head at the end of it
[1:36:14] stinging it was spiritual horse's
[1:36:17] spiritual Devils Chargers that had been
[1:36:19] bound in Euphrates all these years
[1:36:21] supernatural Devils I'm running out of
[1:36:23] something to read what was it the old
[1:36:26] Roman Empire being revived
[1:36:28] the persecution of the Jews they had
[1:36:32] been bound nearly 2,000 years that the
[1:36:34] river Euphrates can't cross the promise
[1:36:36] a religious sect that was trying to get
[1:36:41] to the other side your eighties you know
[1:36:44] came to Eden I think I just did them but
[1:36:46] they were bound there two hundred
[1:36:49] thousand demons of persecution and
[1:36:51] notice what happens under that sixth
[1:36:53] trumpet they were turned loose on the
[1:36:56] Jews to do what to drive them back to
[1:36:59] their land you can't celebrate a Jubilee
[1:37:03] if you're a Jew and you're out of the
[1:37:05] country you got to be in the country
[1:37:09] remember that was three feasts and I
[1:37:11] can't remember went one of them was the
[1:37:12] feast of weeks and feast of firstfruits
[1:37:14] and one other there was three three
[1:37:15] feast that if you were 20 years old you
[1:37:17] had to come to Jerusalem every year to
[1:37:21] celebrate those feasts didn't matter
[1:37:22] where you live you had to come back to
[1:37:23] Israel to do that I'll read them later
[1:37:25] I'm studying home some of that now but
[1:37:28] there's three feasts that you were
[1:37:29] required if you were a male Jew you had
[1:37:31] to go back to the that's why if you'll
[1:37:33] read your Bible Jesus says the Bible was
[1:37:36] saying on the day of the feast Jesus was
[1:37:39] in the temple Jesus went to church and
[1:37:42] he was there during those feast days and
[1:37:45] if I would have been Jesus with you I
[1:37:48] would have probably made people worse
[1:37:50] man than they did him I'd say I'm the
[1:37:54] feast
[1:37:55] I'm the bread he did say that anyway
[1:37:58] said I'm the bread that come from heaven
[1:38:00] I am the lamb I am the one he stood in
[1:38:02] the temple and said I am he but what
[1:38:05] they were so blinded supernatural Devils
[1:38:09] nearly 2000 years then loosed on Stalin
[1:38:12] Hitler upon the Jews they said well that
[1:38:14] isn't Rome it's the same spirit they'd
[1:38:17] done the same thing they did to the
[1:38:18] Christians in the old pagan Roman days
[1:38:21] now watch the natural Israel and the
[1:38:23] spiritual church now as we separate it
[1:38:25] here turned loose on the Jews now
[1:38:27] brother Brown goes on and continues he
[1:38:29] said those two hundred thousand thousand
[1:38:30] demons were loosed on the bride to drive
[1:38:33] us back to our homeland which is the
[1:38:35] Word of God we don't have a continuing
[1:38:38] city or a home road Chris this is not
[1:38:40] our home all right so now let's go right
[1:38:45] here to the next one but I want to stop
[1:38:50] if we get to this we will because right
[1:38:53] now we are we are under the Feast of
[1:38:56] Tabernacles which is the last great
[1:38:59] feast is the Feast of Tabernacles before
[1:39:02] you cycle back around to the to the
[1:39:06] Passover their cycle remember downstairs
[1:39:09] some of you were down there with me we
[1:39:11] did the calendar when we did the dynasty
[1:39:13] in two weeks we did the calendar all
[1:39:15] right and now remember the seventh month
[1:39:17] is October they're months they're year
[1:39:20] starts in March April it's not exactly
[1:39:23] March it's not it's kind of in between
[1:39:24] March and April but their seventh months
[1:39:26] from March April May June July August
[1:39:28] September October so in October the 15th
[1:39:33] day of the seventh month I got it rode
[1:39:35] in my Bible you know that's when sister
[1:39:37] meter when the Lord told sister meter to
[1:39:39] marry brother Branham in October that's
[1:39:45] why because where you and I are feasting
[1:39:49] under the Feast of Tabernacles on the
[1:39:53] first day shall be a holy compass
[1:39:54] convocation you showed no do no servile
[1:39:57] work in other words you take a little
[1:40:00] time off that okay everybody ought to
[1:40:02] say Amen take some time off
[1:40:07] all right let's read this right here
[1:40:09] let's go to the number 10
[1:40:11] I'm gonna read 10 11 and I'm gonna try
[1:40:13] to hit something real quick what brother
[1:40:15] Dale was coming out this morning now
[1:40:16] this is the future home now watch listen
[1:40:19] it look at me
[1:40:19] the future home is not under a 7 the
[1:40:26] future always not on a 49 the future
[1:40:30] home is a day holy convocation eternity
[1:40:34] that's why the millennium is not a eight
[1:40:37] it's a seven an eight is not two now
[1:40:42] remember when we get into this one I'm
[1:40:43] fixing to talk to you in a minute about
[1:40:45] remember this right here there's not
[1:40:47] eight days in a week never has been even
[1:40:51] the Beatles sang about eight days a week
[1:40:53] you know remember that he said I
[1:40:56] remember that somebody should have said
[1:40:59] who's the Beatles nobody said that okay
[1:41:04] but remember you had let's do this one
[1:41:09] two three four five six seven
[1:41:14] there was no eighth day you had seven
[1:41:18] days and then you went back to the first
[1:41:21] day because they had a roll that back
[1:41:25] down just for a second see right here
[1:41:28] well the first day shall be a holy
[1:41:29] convocation but it was for seven days
[1:41:33] now this is heading towards what brother
[1:41:36] Browns reading on because they said
[1:41:37] brother Ram you ran out of your tops
[1:41:39] right you're still in the seventh even
[1:41:42] some of them people knew that if you
[1:41:43] stayed in the seven if you stay in that
[1:41:45] cycle it's not eternal but there's an
[1:41:49] eighth day holy convocation which is the
[1:41:54] day after the seventh which is the first
[1:41:55] now you said that does nothing to us
[1:41:58] it's going to explain why brother Dale's
[1:42:00] was talking about the do you believe
[1:42:01] this morning right thought it has
[1:42:04] everything to do with it because there
[1:42:06] is no 50th Jubilee outside of the seven
[1:42:12] sevens is 49 it's hidden
[1:42:17] that's why that you had 230 430 days
[1:42:21] there was though 70 days missing called
[1:42:24] it was 7 70th Jubilee 77 th Jubilee
[1:42:27] right so anyway let's look at this real
[1:42:30] quick now remember there are seven feast
[1:42:33] days to Feast of Trumpets feast of
[1:42:35] tabernacles feast of sheaf wave all this
[1:42:37] there's seven great feast days that was
[1:42:40] only a top of the seven churches even
[1:42:43] under the Feast of Tabernacles you and I
[1:42:46] are under it now it will cease when we
[1:42:49] go into rapture it will cease for us we
[1:42:53] don't actually go build booths they
[1:42:55] doing in Israel they build a booth and
[1:42:57] they sit down in that booth they build
[1:43:01] oh they build a booth have you seen it
[1:43:03] they build the booth and they sit in
[1:43:07] that booth now that's literal but you
[1:43:10] and I sit in this booth
[1:43:11] forever how long we got here so that's
[1:43:13] what it's there types to us that was
[1:43:18] only top of the seven churches and you
[1:43:20] remember how many Sabbath's there was
[1:43:22] between one and the other seven
[1:43:26] Sabbath's between Pentecost and the
[1:43:29] trumpets which was the seven Church ages
[1:43:32] there was seven feast days that
[1:43:35] represented the seven church ages keep
[1:43:37] your numbers running you said well now
[1:43:39] brother Brown you've done run out you
[1:43:41] got your seven alright let's take the
[1:43:43] last feast which is the Feast of
[1:43:44] Tabernacles he reads the 36 verse seven
[1:43:48] days show you offer offerings made a
[1:43:49] fire unto the Lord on the eighth day he
[1:43:52] repeats on the eighth day shall be a
[1:43:54] holy convocation there is a another holy
[1:43:57] time coming holy convocation unto you
[1:44:01] and you shall offer an offering made by
[1:44:02] fire to the Lord it's a solemn assembly
[1:44:04] you shall do no servile work therein now
[1:44:07] we got an eighth day now there is only
[1:44:10] seven days but here we speak of the
[1:44:13] eighth day holy convocation convocation
[1:44:15] notice do no work in it
[1:44:19] that's why Jesus never spoke of a day we
[1:44:23] have entered into our rest when you're
[1:44:26] born again you have entered into your
[1:44:28] rest
[1:44:29] you'll never rest no better you shall
[1:44:32] not know your soul is resting in God
[1:44:35] we've already entered our 50 but
[1:44:39] remember that Jubilee is for the land
[1:44:42] the 50th Jubilee the seven sevens is for
[1:44:46] everything else the fifties for the land
[1:44:48] you see what I'm doing this is land all
[1:44:52] right that's why we must get to that 50
[1:44:55] to have our Jubilee a release of this
[1:44:58] man all right we've already been
[1:45:02] released in here we went through I hope
[1:45:04] we've went through the Day of Atonement
[1:45:06] I hope we went through the feast of
[1:45:08] firstfruits I hope we went through the
[1:45:10] Passover that's when the lamb died for
[1:45:12] you that's when you accepted that feast
[1:45:13] of Pentecost all right I don't want to
[1:45:17] confuse you so let's just kind of the
[1:45:21] eighth day back to the 1st all right so
[1:45:23] there's no eighth day it goes cycles
[1:45:25] back to the first day but it is set
[1:45:28] aside as the eighth day cause it's the
[1:45:31] holy convocation all right why it speaks
[1:45:35] of eternity as she rolls around without
[1:45:37] a stopping place do you see it now
[1:45:41] notice because right here look this is
[1:45:43] the church agent
[1:45:51] it stops then you have a no church age
[1:45:55] messenger he preaches his message then
[1:45:57] it stops he preaches his he comes on the
[1:46:00] scene preaches his message he stops
[1:46:02] seven times that seven times seven
[1:46:06] equals what 49 but by receiving the Holy
[1:46:11] Ghost we have completed the circle and
[1:46:18] will prove that in just a minute with
[1:46:20] the Jubilee
[1:46:20] all right everybody bear with me just to
[1:46:23] be momentum notice it was also upon this
[1:46:28] eight day last day feast day of the
[1:46:30] tabernacle notice after that after the
[1:46:34] last feast day after the last church age
[1:46:36] after the last complete seven days upon
[1:46:39] the earth after the Millennium
[1:46:44] because millennium is still the earth is
[1:46:48] still right here in time
[1:46:54] still rolling through time but now you
[1:46:57] and I by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:46:59] and by a body change have taken it into
[1:47:01] and he's took it into an eighth day so
[1:47:03] we got our jubilee our land is at rest
[1:47:05] even our soul is at rest now but our
[1:47:08] land is gonna be a rest
[1:47:09] amen well makes me feel good as I get
[1:47:14] older it makes me feel even better
[1:47:16] brother dick
[1:47:19] remember amen remember this is feast of
[1:47:22] tabernacles Tabernacles the gathering
[1:47:24] places that's what we're doing we are
[1:47:26] gathering together unto Him what around
[1:47:28] the Word of God not around not around a
[1:47:30] piece of land but Israel has promised a
[1:47:34] piece of land by people and the holy
[1:47:38] city well obviously that city's got a
[1:47:40] set on a piece of land right we're in
[1:47:46] the Millennium the Bible says they shall
[1:47:48] build houses and have it you see the
[1:47:50] difference in the future home future
[1:47:51] home it's already built for us no
[1:47:54] building but now in the Millennium there
[1:47:56] is building that's why a lot of people
[1:47:57] even brother Russ I think was talking
[1:47:58] about people don't believe that Ezekiel
[1:48:00] 42 44 is a literal temple brother
[1:48:03] Branham said it was it was
[1:48:05] millennial temple that's going to be
[1:48:06] built by the Jews for the Millennium
[1:48:09] because the son of David's got to sit on
[1:48:12] a throne now that throne is literal
[1:48:16] because David said on a literal throne
[1:48:19] and he promised that the that the Israel
[1:48:21] would not be without the son of David
[1:48:23] sitting on the throne so in the
[1:48:25] Millennium there since Jesus on the
[1:48:27] throne we're there in the honeymoon
[1:48:28] we're all there but he's sitting on the
[1:48:30] throne judging the twelve tribes of
[1:48:32] Israel that's what the Bible says amen
[1:48:34] in a temple now there won't be any
[1:48:37] sacrifices at all but what a glorious
[1:48:40] time we'll have to be able to step in
[1:48:44] that outer Court and remember when you
[1:48:45] went through justification stepping that
[1:48:49] arracourt and remember where you went
[1:48:50] through sanctification and step into
[1:48:52] that Holy of Holies and guess what
[1:48:53] you're gonna see are you gonna see God
[1:48:56] and then but in the new earth
[1:49:00] he has already went and prepared the
[1:49:03] place it's built we have nothing to do
[1:49:05] with the building of it Amen eternal oh
[1:49:08] I just love that word a holy convocation
[1:49:10] the eighth day which is only seven days
[1:49:12] look it's only seven there's no eighth
[1:49:15] day but what does it takes and continues
[1:49:17] to cycle it's the first day back again
[1:49:23] I'm telling you this for a purpose right
[1:49:26] because of what brother Dale said this
[1:49:28] morning which is only seven days then on
[1:49:31] the eighth day which comes back to the
[1:49:33] first day again comes right back to the
[1:49:35] first day the eighth day is the holy
[1:49:36] convocation notice seven days only has
[1:49:39] to do with old creation world time seven
[1:49:44] days that's the Millennium the rest day
[1:49:46] as God's labored six days he rested the
[1:49:49] seventh to church labor six days rest
[1:49:52] the seventh but you're still in time
[1:49:58] element even in the Millennium you're in
[1:50:01] a time element alright I ain't speaking
[1:50:04] of the eternal when he's talking about
[1:50:06] the Millennium but you see there's no
[1:50:08] such a thing as eight days you go right
[1:50:10] back to the first day the first day
[1:50:12] again
[1:50:14] alright let's read this last one it's
[1:50:16] from the future home
[1:50:18] the feast of tabernacles was the last
[1:50:20] feast the seventh feast we are
[1:50:21] worshipping now unto the feast of
[1:50:22] tabernacles the seven churches in the
[1:50:25] millennium will be under the feast of
[1:50:27] tabernacles again in the seventh day but
[1:50:29] then after the seventh day we have a
[1:50:31] holy convocation go back into the
[1:50:34] eternal how by the eternal one that came
[1:50:37] and redeemed us taking us back letting
[1:50:39] us recognize that we were a part of this
[1:50:43] and by all right with that so now let's
[1:50:46] try to look at something what brother
[1:50:47] Dale was tell about this morning because
[1:50:49] look when you have in the old cycle back
[1:50:57] when we were talking about in Leviticus
[1:50:59] 25 eight every seven years there was a
[1:51:03] Jubilee okay every seven years it was a
[1:51:12] Jubilee now what happened was is in the
[1:51:17] middle of this sixth year a trumpet
[1:51:22] sound caused that it's actually not in
[1:51:26] the total Miller years in October
[1:51:28] most everything happens on that Sabbath
[1:51:30] months which is a harvest month I hope
[1:51:33] you get that which is a harvest month a
[1:51:37] harvest month when the reapers reap the
[1:51:42] harvest and puts it in the storehouse I
[1:51:47] hope you see that all right now look I'm
[1:51:53] reading this from Wikipedia so it's got
[1:51:55] to be true
[1:52:01] all the tech guys are back in the back
[1:52:03] giggling no listen because it's true
[1:52:06] watch Jubilee
[1:52:07] deals largely with land property and
[1:52:11] property rights everybody set up on the
[1:52:14] edge of their seat so when you go to
[1:52:15] sleep you fall over in the Hitchin
[1:52:18] according to Leviticus slaves and
[1:52:20] prisoners would be freed debts would be
[1:52:23] forgiven and the mercies of God would be
[1:52:25] particularly manifested everybody got
[1:52:28] that now look this only applies when the
[1:52:33] Jewish people live in the Land of Israel
[1:52:35] according to their tribes
[1:52:38] they've been scattered and dispersed for
[1:52:41] years hundreds thousands of years
[1:52:43] they've been dispersed all over the
[1:52:45] place right amen so they got to come
[1:52:48] back to the promised land so every seven
[1:52:51] years all right so let's go I see if you
[1:52:56] can pull up Leviticus what brother Dale
[1:52:58] was talking about this morning pull up
[1:53:00] Leviticus 25 but I want to read you
[1:53:03] something let me tell you the Bible it's
[1:53:06] perfect you got your Bible turn to
[1:53:09] Genesis 29 Genesis 29 now here is Jacob
[1:53:20] a type of Christ all right now watch
[1:53:26] Jacob because remember whatever was
[1:53:32] bought and everything done to you you
[1:53:33] I'm going back to what brother Dale said
[1:53:35] we talked about slaves and owners and
[1:53:37] all this stuff it's not like we think
[1:53:39] but it proves it right here because
[1:53:42] remember where did brother Branham get
[1:53:44] the revelation of one week equals seven
[1:53:46] years you got out of the Bible if you're
[1:53:53] not ready we're fixing to all right
[1:53:57] Genesis 29 you ready verse 17 talking
[1:54:04] about Jacob finding a bride Leo was
[1:54:09] tenderized but Rachel was beautiful and
[1:54:11] wealthy
[1:54:11] remember Leo was older Israel
[1:54:15] Rachel was younger type of Gentile but
[1:54:19] watch what happened and Jacob loved
[1:54:21] Rachel and said I will serve the seven
[1:54:25] years he wasn't in slavery he was
[1:54:30] working towards something he was working
[1:54:32] toward a wife y'all think a year or two
[1:54:38] of datin seven years both Holly read
[1:54:45] what it says though for Rachel the
[1:54:48] younger one but watch and Laban said it
[1:54:51] is better that I give her to thee than
[1:54:53] that I should give her to another man
[1:54:54] abide with me and Jacob served seven
[1:54:57] years for Rachel and they seemed unto
[1:55:01] him but a few days for the love he had
[1:55:05] for her a thousand years of the day and
[1:55:09] the day as a thousand years to God he's
[1:55:11] not he's not he's not he's not
[1:55:14] overanxious he knows when we're gonna
[1:55:16] come but he is anxious to see us I'd be
[1:55:18] anxious to see my bride wouldn't you and
[1:55:20] Jacob served for Rachel for seven years
[1:55:26] now how you gonna get one we keep one's
[1:55:29] equal seven years
[1:55:30] look at verse 27 oh they got it up here
[1:55:36] fulfil her week one week equals seven
[1:55:44] years fulfill her week and we will give
[1:55:48] need this also for the service now
[1:55:50] remember the story keep turning over
[1:55:52] verse 28 and Jacob did so and fulfilled
[1:55:56] her week what was that week seven years
[1:55:58] one week equals seven years and Jacob
[1:56:03] nestling fulfilled her week and gave him
[1:56:05] Rachel his daughter to why but remember
[1:56:07] the custom was is you couldn't marry the
[1:56:10] younger before the older got married so
[1:56:12] Christ had to marry hello somebody
[1:56:14] Christ had to marry Laban first the
[1:56:18] Israel first then he had to get rid of
[1:56:21] her to marry Rachel
[1:56:23] hey man not get rid of her but divorced
[1:56:26] her and Laban gave Rachel his daughter
[1:56:34] bill his handmaid and he went on into
[1:56:36] Rachel and he loved he went in also
[1:56:38] under Rachel and he loved also Rachel
[1:56:40] more than Leah and served with him yet
[1:56:41] seven more years in other words what
[1:56:43] happened
[1:56:44] Laban he's a he's a con man like brother
[1:56:49] Ernie Berlin Villanueva said he said
[1:56:50] that was to con me and working against
[1:56:52] each other
[1:56:52] Jacob was a shyster and Laban with a con
[1:56:55] man so they was they were conning each
[1:56:57] other because remember what happened was
[1:56:58] he gave him Rachel but when he sent him
[1:57:01] in on the wedding night it must have
[1:57:02] been real dark because Lea's the one
[1:57:05] that got in there with with Jacob and he
[1:57:07] realized that the next morning and said
[1:57:08] hey you give me the wrong woman and then
[1:57:10] Laban says hey I can't give you the
[1:57:12] younger without giving you the older
[1:57:14] first so Jacob had to work seven more
[1:57:16] years
[1:57:17] this guy was 14 years for he could have
[1:57:21] Rachel but you know what God needed that
[1:57:24] bride he needed me and you he worked
[1:57:26] seven church ages to get to us you know
[1:57:27] and then he worked seven other years and
[1:57:32] when the Lord saw that leah was hated he
[1:57:33] opened up her womb but Rachel was barren
[1:57:37] now we know the whole story but look
[1:57:38] fulfill her week one week is seven years
[1:57:42] so Jacob worked seven years God worked
[1:57:46] through seven Church ages seven times
[1:57:51] seven seven years for Leah seven years
[1:57:57] for Rachel but if you put it in our the
[1:57:59] way we look at it seven times seven is
[1:58:02] forty-nine so he got a natural wife
[1:58:05] though but we're talking about spiritual
[1:58:07] here so let's look at that I want to
[1:58:09] show you something Israel just for a bi
[1:58:13] okay shake yourself just for me all
[1:58:15] right look so ever seven years there was
[1:58:21] a release then you had ever seven
[1:58:24] Sabbath's seven times seven equals 49
[1:58:28] that's 49 years from one Sabbath seven
[1:58:32] times cycle is called a cycle it's
[1:58:35] called a Jubilee cycle if you ever want
[1:58:37] to look at
[1:58:37] look up Jubilee cycle alright but what
[1:58:40] happens is here's the whole story this
[1:58:44] is what's going to make it all sound
[1:58:46] good when you had seven when you come to
[1:58:54] the 49th year can you pull up Leviticus
[1:58:57] 25 8 we'll wait just a minute
[1:59:04] you cheated you pulled up what brother
[1:59:08] branham what brother Dale had this
[1:59:10] morning that's that's fine that's smart
[1:59:13] that's not cheating that's smart
[1:59:15] now look the is 25 18 thou shalt
[1:59:17] number seven Sabbath's 7 times 7 49
[1:59:23] years then thou shalt cause the trumpet
[1:59:27] of the Jubilee to sound look here's your
[1:59:30] 40 let's just say this is your 49th year
[1:59:32] let's just put this down here you're on
[1:59:34] your own year 49 in your 49th year in
[1:59:39] October not at the 1st of the year not
[1:59:44] at the last of the year but in October
[1:59:46] and thou shalt number seven Sabbath's
[1:59:49] then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the
[1:59:52] Jubilee and you're not in the Jubilee
[1:59:54] year yet you got a lap over you got a
[2:00:00] lap over you got a lap it back the
[2:00:02] Jubilee the sound on the tenth day so on
[2:00:04] October the 10th there's gonna be a
[2:00:10] jubilee
[2:00:10] get ready get ready in the Day of
[2:00:16] Atonement so you make the trumpet sound
[2:00:22] throughout all your land and ye shall
[2:00:26] hallow the fiftieth year you blew the
[2:00:29] trumpet in October of 4 49th year then
[2:00:33] you proclaim to Liberty on the fiftieth
[2:00:36] year now the problem with Israel was
[2:00:38] they never celebrated that they
[2:00:41] celebrated the seventh oh yeah it was
[2:00:43] easy every 7 years you'd let a few
[2:00:45] people go free you keep a few people you
[2:00:47] get rid of a little bit of land you can
[2:00:49] have a little bit of land now but on the
[2:00:51] 50th
[2:00:52] according to the Bible everybody
[2:00:55] poverty and rich went just like this and
[2:01:01] Jews are never gonna do that not the
[2:01:03] natural Jew so they never celebrated
[2:01:06] that 50th Jubilee
[2:01:07] they've never celebrated a natural
[2:01:09] Jubilee it's all in history I've read
[2:01:12] history I've read ten different
[2:01:13] commentaries no one has ever said that
[2:01:15] Israel did what the 50th Jubilee was
[2:01:19] said to do and that was to give
[2:01:20] everything back everybody it doesn't
[2:01:21] matter if you had 15 cars but if you
[2:01:24] bought five from this guy you had to
[2:01:26] give him five back if you bought 14
[2:01:29] horses from this guy you had to give
[2:01:31] them 14 horses back so that he had 14
[2:01:35] and everything comes equal see now that
[2:01:39] happens to me and you on our fiftieth
[2:01:41] year and you shall hallow the fiftieth
[2:01:45] then proclaim Liberty throughout all the
[2:01:48] land unto all the inhabitants thereof
[2:01:51] and it shall be a jubilee unto you and
[2:01:54] you shall return every man unto his
[2:01:56] possession and you shall return every
[2:01:58] man unto his family now I want to prove
[2:02:01] something to you right here real quick
[2:02:03] and then we'll close we're brother Dale
[2:02:05] was talking about because it might be a
[2:02:06] little strange for some of you mm-hmm is
[2:02:09] that when you come to the 49th year
[2:02:11] everybody okay well that the jubilee
[2:02:14] trumpet sounded not to jubilee but now
[2:02:18] remember you never had a fiftieth year
[2:02:26] the priest counted seven times seven
[2:02:29] when you come up to the 49th year he
[2:02:31] said all right the next year will be a
[2:02:33] jubilee a year but it's not an extra
[2:02:40] year because you couldn't have you
[2:02:43] thirty four hundred thirty years as
[2:02:44] brother I'm said if you had an extra
[2:02:45] year put in there what was that this is
[2:02:49] so good what was the Jubilee a year it
[2:02:52] was the first year of the next cycle so
[2:02:57] they lapped over the church ages lapped
[2:03:00] over
[2:03:02] it was a lap over the problem was is is
[2:03:05] real celebrated it - right here and
[2:03:07] stopped but when they get in the
[2:03:10] Millennium they're gonna celebrate
[2:03:14] Jubilee because when they get into
[2:03:16] Jubilee
[2:03:17] hey there's 12 tribes are not going one
[2:03:19] of them Jews not gonna walk gonna say I
[2:03:20] got more cows than you got I got more
[2:03:23] horses and you got no there's going to
[2:03:26] be happy to be there so that's why and
[2:03:28] you say well how can you prove that well
[2:03:30] you know what I wasn't smart enough to
[2:03:32] prove it the Bible smart enough to prove
[2:03:34] it because remember I mean get my
[2:03:41] paperwork out here remember let's turn
[2:03:44] to Leviticus 25 19 brothers if y'all
[2:03:49] pull up Leviticus 25 19 I'm sorry and be
[2:03:51] a little bit long but we're gonna get
[2:03:52] this out of the way and the land shall
[2:03:55] yield her fruit and you shall eat your
[2:03:59] fill and dwell therein and safety and if
[2:04:01] you shall say what shall we eat the
[2:04:03] seventh year comes remember you don't
[2:04:06] plant you just read for what's already
[2:04:11] coming growing right and you and if you
[2:04:14] shall say what shall eat the seventh
[2:04:16] year behold we shall not sow or gather
[2:04:19] in our increase God said then I will
[2:04:22] command my blessing upon you in the
[2:04:27] sixth seal six year and it shall bring
[2:04:32] forth fruit for three years and you
[2:04:36] shall sow the eighth year which is what
[2:04:38] that year right there now if there's a
[2:04:41] 50th year inserted you go down to the
[2:04:45] next year you can't do that that means
[2:04:50] you would have to win roll it back down
[2:04:55] yeah then I will come and my blessing
[2:04:57] you own the six year and you shall bring
[2:04:59] forth fruit for three years sixth
[2:05:03] seventh and eighth now if you had one
[2:05:07] more year in there and before Bibles
[2:05:12] perfect
[2:05:13] you had to wait four years together
[2:05:17] another crop you can't do that listen to
[2:05:19] what this commentator said I read you
[2:05:21] know what sometimes you ought to be able
[2:05:22] to just read what people say cuz look
[2:05:24] and you shall so the eighth year in need
[2:05:26] of the old fruit until the ninth year
[2:05:28] until her fruit comes into the old store
[2:05:31] but you can't stick another year in
[2:05:32] there because watch since the 49th year
[2:05:36] was already a sabbatical year the land
[2:05:38] was required to be left fallow during it
[2:05:40] that's why God said three years six
[2:05:43] seven and eight because you had to plan
[2:05:46] on the eight you didn't plan on the
[2:05:47] seven you've gathered your harvest on
[2:05:49] the seventh you ate of the ou8 you
[2:05:52] didn't you didn't plant you planted on
[2:05:54] eight here well they took one more year
[2:05:55] to get your crop in or six months I'm
[2:05:57] not a whole year but it took longer
[2:06:01] since the 49th year was already a
[2:06:03] sabbatical year and the land was
[2:06:04] required to be left fallow during it but
[2:06:06] at the 50 years if the fiftieth year
[2:06:09] also had to be kept follow you know if
[2:06:13] somebody added an extra year besides
[2:06:14] this coming back to the first year no
[2:06:19] new crop would be available for two
[2:06:20] years and only the summer fruits would
[2:06:23] be available for the following year
[2:06:24] creating a much greater risk of
[2:06:26] starvation
[2:06:28] now they contend that the Jubilee year
[2:06:30] was identical with the 49th year so
[2:06:34] there's not you say what's the problem
[2:06:37] what's what's what you told my brother
[2:06:38] Brown said right here he said it's not
[2:06:41] an eighth day he said you'd go back to
[2:06:44] the first it's not a fiftieth year you
[2:06:48] go back to the first perfect perfect
[2:06:53] brother BAM knew what he was talking
[2:06:55] about of course obviously the Bible
[2:06:56] knows what he's telling no it's nobody's
[2:06:58] telling them but that's what you call it
[2:06:59] Jubilee cycle so 7 times 7 is 4 and 4 49
[2:07:04] all right so now mm-hmm
[2:07:07] just real quick what that brother dales
[2:07:09] tell about the thirty four hundred and
[2:07:10] thirty years it be thirty-five hundred
[2:07:13] years if it was 50 70 times 50 he talked
[2:07:16] covered this morning if it was seventy
[2:07:18] times fifty years but it's 70 times 49
[2:07:24] then your Jubilee a year see they never
[2:07:27] do
[2:07:27] clarity because they never blew the
[2:07:29] trumpet in October to say this is going
[2:07:31] to be a jubilee year they'd had to give
[2:07:34] everything back but it will blow the
[2:07:38] Feast of Trumpets will blow in the white
[2:07:41] going into the millennium and when it
[2:07:43] blows its going to blow and tell us tell
[2:07:46] them not us that you are now in your
[2:07:49] Jubilee year your land can rest you know
[2:07:52] what me and you're not gonna have to
[2:07:54] plant weren't even in the future home
[2:07:59] the brother Branson you won't be
[2:08:00] planting fruit but now they might be
[2:08:02] outside but you're not gonna be playing
[2:08:04] fruit we're listen it's a rest time time
[2:08:07] of rest for each one of us but that
[2:08:11] proves to me you're talking about what
[2:08:12] brother Brown was talking about they
[2:08:13] said he was wrong no he's actually right
[2:08:15] there's no 50th year it stood back to
[2:08:17] the first step it's the back to the
[2:08:19] first year so you had a Jubilee ever 49
[2:08:21] years and when you come to that fiftieth
[2:08:23] year if they didn't blow the trumpet you
[2:08:26] just went right on with another
[2:08:27] seven-year cycle and that's what they've
[2:08:29] been doing 7 times 7 is 49 but when a
[2:08:33] prophet come and blow the trumpet he
[2:08:39] proclaimed that right there that all can
[2:08:44] go free body spirit and soul because a
[2:08:49] lot of even in the church ages sure they
[2:08:51] went free they had their Pentecost they
[2:08:54] had their time amen but when you come to
[2:08:57] now we're at the very end ours is not
[2:08:59] just a 49 we're heading toward the land
[2:09:03] the land being made free this thing
[2:09:07] right here being made free less than
[2:09:09] their feet this is what we're looking
[2:09:12] for we're pushing toward a body change
[2:09:15] we're not pushing toward a new new birth
[2:09:18] the new birth has never changed but the
[2:09:22] new birth is brother Dale said last
[2:09:23] Sunday the new birth according to
[2:09:25] Malachi 4 is not going to just change
[2:09:29] our inside it's gonna change our outside
[2:09:33] it's the 50 years of your land the
[2:09:38] Jubilee of your land to go
[2:09:41] free who the Sun has set free it's free
[2:09:48] and D god bless you hope that kind of
[2:09:51] helps you a little bit because there is
[2:09:52] no 50th year but there had to be on
[2:09:57] October the 10th of the previous year
[2:09:59] there had to be a priest declare the
[2:10:05] 50th year and what happened in the Old
[2:10:08] Testament they never declared it because
[2:10:10] you know what they did they walked over
[2:10:11] that priest and they went don't blow a
[2:10:14] trumpet I'll lose all my money in other
[2:10:18] words ain't giving you no money in other
[2:10:22] words hand here's you some here don't
[2:10:23] blow that trumpet don't you think that
[2:10:25] you'd do that
[2:10:26] sure he would if he's sitting there with
[2:10:28] all the million cattle and all this all
[2:10:30] this stuff you know I mean dad was over
[2:10:32] there one time the rest have been there
[2:10:34] four times Jews are different they're
[2:10:36] pretty staunch they're pretty you know
[2:10:38] we're right here and you're down well
[2:10:39] you're not even here you're down like
[2:10:41] underneath here you know the Gentiles
[2:10:43] we're just dogs but they just got to
[2:10:46] realize one thing them dogs are ordained
[2:10:49] to get out of here before God can come
[2:10:52] and visit them less thing a song let's
[2:10:55] give these youth the big hand that's a
[2:11:00] big youth near the cross what page 1 205

[2:12:45] be singing

[2:13:08] [Music]
[2:13:11] you doing
[2:13:18] [Music]
[2:13:23] my
[2:13:33] why
[2:13:36] so shy
[2:13:40] [Music]
[2:13:48] think about this when Jesus was on earth
[2:13:51] like I said he was there during all
[2:13:53] those feast he would go to the temple
[2:13:55] but you remember what happened they were
[2:13:58] at the feast of Pentecost when Jesus got
[2:14:01] lost read your Bible
[2:14:05] Joseph and Mary went to the feast of
[2:14:07] Pentecost they were leaving the feast of
[2:14:10] Pentecost and they lost Jesus and
[2:14:12] brother Branham said that's where all
[2:14:15] the denominations left Jesus was that
[2:14:17] today of Pentecost they lost him they
[2:14:20] forgot him they couldn't find him but I
[2:14:23] was just thinking now as we were singing
[2:14:24] that song you know Jesus was there
[2:14:26] during the feast of Pentecost during his
[2:14:28] life but remember no one no one
[2:14:32] celebrated that feast of Pentecost while
[2:14:35] Jesus was there the way that they were
[2:14:37] supposed to celebrate him the feast of
[2:14:41] Pentecost happened fifty days after he
[2:14:43] died and then the true Pentecost the
[2:14:47] true fifty day was on that day when he
[2:14:50] came back in the whole of the form of
[2:14:52] the Holy Ghost and he went into 120
[2:14:54] believers that was the true day of
[2:14:56] Pentecost they didn't lose him they
[2:14:59] found him that's what you and I we find
[2:15:01] him on that day of Pentecost which Penta
[2:15:04] is 50 so we find him not in the 49 we
[2:15:08] find him in a 50 hey man let's bow our
[2:15:11] heads the Heavenly Father thank you for
[2:15:13] this day thanks for the time that we've
