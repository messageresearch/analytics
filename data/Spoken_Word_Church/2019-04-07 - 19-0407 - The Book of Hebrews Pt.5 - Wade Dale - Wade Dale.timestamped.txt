[0:00] man good to have another Sunday good to
[0:02] be here
[0:03] I'm good to have our minister with us
[0:04] here sister Monica black she's uh she's
[0:10] got someone take up her duty so she's
[0:11] coming into what the first time ever all
[0:29] right where you are in the book of
[0:31] Hebrews have a good time in the book of
[0:33] Hebrews let's start with Hebrews chapter
[0:35] three go back to verse one
[0:38] we got down to 14 Thank You this it's a
[0:41] high level book Hebrew it just gives you
[0:44] everything that you need for redemption
[0:49] wherefore holy brethren partakers of the
[0:52] heavenly calling consider the Apostle
[0:54] and high priest of my profession
[0:56] Christ Jesus who was faithful to him
[0:59] that appointed him can you see that it
[1:03] was faithful to him that appointed him
[1:05] also that Moses was faithful in all his
[1:07] health for this man was accounted worthy
[1:09] of more glory than Moses why because
[1:12] Moses did build the house Moses built
[1:14] and natural temple Jesus Christ came he
[1:18] was the natural temple he was the temple
[1:20] of God I for this man was counted worthy
[1:24] of more glory than Moses and as much as
[1:26] he who hath builded the house have more
[1:29] honor than the house for every house is
[1:33] building by some man but he that built
[1:35] all things is God all right and Moses
[1:38] barely was faithful in all his house as
[1:41] a servant for a testimony of those
[1:43] things which were to be spoken after in
[1:46] other words what Moses did and all of
[1:48] what goes on in the Old Testament was
[1:52] speaking of a time when the real temple
[1:55] was going
[1:55] the real man was going to show up Moses
[2:00] was very good Moses was the profit
[2:02] motive was annoying Moses wrote the
[2:04] first five books in the Bible Moses was
[2:06] a great man but he went to the grave as
[2:08] this man because Moses couldn't give his
[2:11] life and that life come back into the
[2:12] believer but this man were talking about
[2:14] book the Hebrews that Paul is talking
[2:16] about he's the one that can send his
[2:19] spirit back into you and make you him
[2:24] made manifest yes but Christ as a son
[2:28] over his own house whose house we are
[2:31] yeah there's that word if we hold fast
[2:34] the confidence and rejoicing of the hope
[2:37] firm to the end verse 7 where for now
[2:40] this is where we got into them last week
[2:43] in the interpolating he's not
[2:47] interpreting he's interpolating
[2:49] interpolated means he's going to add to
[2:51] it to make us understand because it
[2:54] would have been this look read that
[2:55] square for all right let's go always
[2:58] down in verse 12 wherefore take heed
[3:00] brethren lest there be any of you an
[3:02] evil heart of unbelief in departing from
[3:04] believing God if I got that but Paul
[3:08] interpolates and tells you he goes all
[3:11] the way back into the Old Testament and
[3:14] tells you what he's talking about
[3:15] therefore or wherefore comma here's Paul
[3:19] interpolating as the Holy Ghost saith
[3:21] today if you will hear his voice harden
[3:24] not your hearts as in the provocation in
[3:28] other words what they provoked God in
[3:29] the wounds in the days of temptation in
[3:32] the wilderness when your father's
[3:35] tempted me proved me and saw my works 40
[3:38] years wherefore I was grieved with that
[3:41] generation and said they do all err in
[3:44] their heart and they have not known my
[3:46] way so I swear in my wrath they shall
[3:49] not enter into my rest all right so now
[3:52] let's go back here and go
[3:54] verse 7 and read wherefore with all that
[3:57] in our thought wherefore take heed
[4:00] brethren lest there be any of you an
[4:02] evil heart of unbelief in departing from
[4:04] the Living console that's what happened
[4:06] to the children of Israel they confess
[4:08] with their mouth but they didn't believe
[4:10] in their heart take heed brethren lest
[4:13] there be be in any of you an evil heart
[4:16] of unbelief in departing from the Living
[4:20] God but a short one another daily while
[4:23] it is called today and it's not today
[4:26] that's today
[4:27] well it's called today lest any of you
[4:30] be hardened through the deceitfulness of
[4:33] sin and here for we'll stop that last
[4:34] week let's clear that off so we can
[4:36] start somewhere else next time for we
[4:38] are made protective of Christ if as that
[4:42] worthless time that lacks not the Bible
[4:44] studies talking about faith and
[4:46] believing that word if we hold the
[4:51] beginning of our confidence steadfast
[4:52] into the end thank you 24 says those who
[4:56] endure to the end shall be saved so
[4:58] that's what he's saying that you're
[5:00] going to endure many different things
[5:03] many different trials troubles we talked
[5:06] about last night we'll go through trials
[5:07] and ability tribulation but we haven't
[5:12] been we haven't been in the total
[5:14] persecution yet I was reading this
[5:17] morning in the paper it's kind of funny
[5:18] how you get thinking about stuff and the
[5:22] I'm gonna say it anyway because in the
[5:25] newspaper the Church of Latter day
[5:27] Saints have took a stand against the
[5:30] LGBT lesbian gays and all of those
[5:33] transgender they stick her stance
[5:35] against them and they're getting heat
[5:37] well the mass of this we're getting some
[5:39] real heat because they won't allow
[5:42] same-sex marriage obviously but they
[5:44] have the Methodist once you can bring a
[5:48] gay person in as a priest or our lazy
[5:52] and girl as the priest in the Methodist
[5:54] Church well the other half day so
[5:56] there's fixing to be a vote here coming
[5:57] up enough
[5:58] the middle of April an individual that
[6:00] may split that denomination in half and
[6:06] I'm gonna tell you that spirit is very
[6:09] prevalent because it's just like they
[6:11] said and then they did the Mormon said
[6:13] hey we don't want to be like Sodom and
[6:14] Gomorrah look what happened in Sodom and
[6:16] Gomorrah when they started doing these
[6:19] acts it's where you got all any words
[6:22] from sodomy sodomizing all that come
[6:25] from Sodom they were doing some really
[6:26] weird stuff in Sodom and Gomorrah and
[6:28] God walked them off you're so they're
[6:29] right there even out in the but see what
[6:32] we're having to cover we should not have
[6:34] to cover that as message believers that
[6:37] should be our total stance everybody
[6:39] 100% that we love the people and you
[6:42] know what they always say that we love
[6:44] the people we do but we're not going to
[6:46] be partakers of that right or are
[6:49] supportive that's why I say them online
[6:52] I don't do I won't go to Starbucks
[6:55] Starbucks is owned by totally gay people
[6:59] that said in public they hate Christian
[7:01] right yes so I'll never and you know
[7:04] white Walmart male gay people in there
[7:06] but I don't care it's this day took a
[7:08] stand
[7:09] so as a Christian I'm gonna take a stand
[7:11] you remember want to let happen cuz
[7:12] chick-fil-a will come out with giving
[7:14] sandwiches away and they weren't gonna
[7:16] be open on Sunday cuz they were
[7:17] Christian then Starbucks comes up and
[7:18] says well we don't believe in this
[7:20] Christianity stuff we're gonna you know
[7:22] in other words they're they're stupid is
[7:23] really what they call this week call
[7:25] this week and student people so I'm just
[7:28] not going to support you actually we
[7:30] have a little contention in the
[7:32] Philippines but they love Starbucks
[7:33] there's one on every corner over there
[7:36] so we were going somewhere they said
[7:38] let's go Starbucks this is offset
[7:40] outside yoga you know you won't pick a
[7:41] green card rather that's the best coffee
[7:43] in the world
[7:44] that's good look I'll sit and drink
[7:47] water on the outside and I told him what
[7:52] and they were on the way well okay about
[7:56] 15 look 15 minutes later they found
[7:58] another coffee shop but that's just me
[8:01] that just my conviction on I don't care
[8:03] injuries
[8:04] understand I'm not because my money goes
[8:08] directly to your money will go directly
[8:10] to whatever yeah so whatever their life
[8:15] styling is but but that and talk about
[8:17] our government then we come that
[8:21] persecution if the government passes a
[8:24] law that it's all right to be that then
[8:28] surely church and state should be
[8:30] separated but it won't we know that we
[8:34] know program said church and states them
[8:36] until together and then what they're
[8:38] going to do is is they're gonna demand
[8:40] that you let getting that bends in you
[8:42] Church and let them do whatever our
[8:45] congregation that would be religious
[8:51] persecution in and it was kind of funny
[8:54] the there was a bill in the house don't
[9:00] somebody the other day we were talking
[9:01] about me being a politician and a
[9:04] preacher and a government employee I
[9:06] said y'all can't telling jokes around
[9:07] man see cuz it always involves a
[9:09] politician the preacher or a regular
[9:12] many believe but being a politician I
[9:15] kind of watch things but in in the state
[9:16] this this state session Georgia there
[9:20] was a bill that come forth to give
[9:23] churches the right have sovereignty and
[9:27] of the church being a religious group
[9:30] their sovereign above anything else it
[9:32] didn't pass it almost did so that may
[9:36] tell you something even our conservative
[9:39] government may still be leaning toward
[9:41] letting letting church and state come
[9:43] together but we know it's gonna happen
[9:45] we don't brother Brown said they'll come
[9:47] together as a group and they'll come in
[9:49] and they'll they'll and Bible says it'll
[9:52] take over by flattery so it's not gonna
[9:54] be some highfalutin something they'll
[9:56] just kind of slide something they're not
[10:00] just look says exhort one another daily
[10:04] wise called today lest any of you be
[10:06] hardened through the deceitfulness of
[10:08] sin Ghalib umbrella bottom tells us that
[10:11] some people even in the ranks of the
[10:13] message would lean toward that
[10:16] I don't relieve that quote maybe I'll
[10:19] bring it next Sunday we're brother Brown
[10:20] said that they will go into this system
[10:22] thinking that it's better for us to be
[10:26] together then for us to be separate look
[10:28] that's not going to be true right that's
[10:31] not the meet truth that's that's a lot
[10:34] of the devil we are for we are made
[10:36] protectors of Christ
[10:37] yeah we hold the beginning of our
[10:40] confidence steadfast into the end
[10:42] there's a lot that's not gonna make it
[10:44] to the end while it is said today if you
[10:48] will hear his voice harden not your
[10:50] heart as in the provocation we just read
[10:53] that up at the top for some when they
[10:56] had heard did provoke howbeit not all
[11:00] that came out of Egypt by Moses another
[11:04] day two people Joshua Taylor the only
[11:08] two people God had to totally destroy a
[11:10] whole nation of old you know that's kind
[11:14] of that's kind of a paradox God knew
[11:16] that he was gonna bring them two million
[11:18] people out of Egypt knew they were going
[11:21] to turn him down and knew he was gonna
[11:22] have to kill him in the wilderness but
[11:24] anyway he still brought him out you know
[11:26] why because he had to give them a choice
[11:28] they had to make a choice it was their
[11:31] choice when they got out of the
[11:32] wilderness I mean man let these people
[11:34] come out with a mighty hand you're
[11:36] talking about one man even take the two
[11:40] million people which they really didn't
[11:42] fight at all in Egypt nothing daunted
[11:44] all fight for but here we are two
[11:46] million people looking back in a country
[11:48] that was at that time was as big as the
[11:50] United States largest economy in the
[11:52] world
[11:53] Egypt owned everything they had castles
[11:56] palaces they had horsemen by no number
[11:59] and this one man Moses with God totally
[12:05] wipe the whole place out and finally the
[12:08] people's is all ready to leave all right
[12:12] so that's what's happening here we got
[12:13] to see one thing's for sure it wasn't
[12:15] the people that delivered because look
[12:20] he had to take them I had to kill them
[12:22] till they were hurting the whole forty
[12:24] years they just kept
[12:25] and complain murmuring complaint some
[12:27] I'm going to go back to ijen but Josh
[12:29] when Caleb said no were more than able
[12:31] to take this land but with whom was he
[12:36] grieved forty years was it not with them
[12:40] that had sent his carcasses fell in the
[12:42] wilderness Josh when Caleb was the only
[12:45] to go ahead and wipe them out
[12:48] why'd that old generation out and bring
[12:50] up that's what the theme of brother
[12:52] Royals anniversary meeting was the
[12:54] Joshua generation which is the group
[12:56] that was raised up to take the people
[12:58] over and I don't think that's what's
[13:02] happening now not saying I'm not saying
[13:05] that the old group that God had to let
[13:08] them die and they were eternally lost no
[13:11] but they're it's just a type here that
[13:13] this mentality of the older generation
[13:15] that that just preaches that brother
[13:17] Brennan was a prophet that's not gonna
[13:19] take us over there's got to be a Joshua
[13:23] generation to come in that has a new way
[13:26] of thinking yes then Joshua being a type
[13:28] of the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is
[13:31] what's going to take us over and then
[13:33] and then Caleb being a time with the
[13:35] bride also give me my mountain in other
[13:37] words when he was 80 years old he said
[13:39] he felt just as good at 80 as he did at
[13:41] 40 most of you cannot say that most of
[13:44] them that made a baby yet but we're
[13:46] getting there
[13:47] we're getting there you ain't do this
[13:51] guy's
[13:55] eighty-one this month well happy
[13:57] birthday James birthday swings here
[14:00] Winston Winston to be vp8 so we head
[14:07] that direction but door handle and all
[14:10] that so I'm so what I'm saying is Gandhi
[14:12] didn't have to let the physical people
[14:14] die out but he let the thought and the
[14:17] idea that brother Brian was coming back
[14:20] brother Ron Scott is coming back and do
[14:21] brother rounds this but Ron's is brother
[14:23] runs it that's fine that was ok during
[14:25] the journey but when we getting ready to
[14:28] go over into the promised land Moses I
[14:32] serving is dead right but I'll be with
[14:35] you Joshua
[14:36] just as I was with him so there was a
[14:38] transfer of power there from Moses to
[14:41] Joshua and then from Joshua there with
[14:44] all them people that were 20-year old
[14:45] and under that went over into the
[14:48] Promised Land in that but still and I
[14:50] remember they went to the promised land
[14:52] but they had to fight for every inch of
[14:54] ground to take that they picked up I
[14:57] just went through reading I think I'm in
[15:00] Deuteronomy and somewhere in there it
[15:02] gives them numbers Deuteronomy Joshua he
[15:06] tells that how they were placed in the
[15:10] lamb book
[15:11] well they don't just say they'd walk in
[15:12] and take them they walked in the head
[15:14] fine but I remember those people like
[15:17] Jericho the RAM said when y'all cross
[15:20] the river we were defeated you know
[15:21] that's what we gotta realize this this
[15:24] is Devil's already defeated we've just
[15:27] got to go into the journey but with whom
[15:30] was he agreed forty years
[15:32] excuse me wasn't not with them that had
[15:34] send these carpets fell in the
[15:36] wilderness and to whom swear he that
[15:38] they should not enter into his rest but
[15:41] to them that believe not so they didn't
[15:44] get to enter in even Moses didn't get to
[15:48] enter him
[15:48] was a prophet and he did he did you know
[15:52] remember he didn't speak sanderoff he
[15:54] smote it so we see that they could not
[16:00] enter in because of unbelief that's the
[16:03] whole thing we can't enter in done now
[16:06] remember verse four is it's a
[16:08] continuation he's writing a letter to
[16:10] the Hebrews writing the letter of
[16:11] Hebrews says let us therefore fear lest
[16:14] a promise being left us of entering into
[16:19] his rest any of you should seem to come
[16:21] short of it because remember Jesus gave
[16:24] us what a rest day arrest time not a day
[16:27] on the side of your son your money but a
[16:29] rest that we here in - come to me all
[16:33] you labor and heavy laden and I'll give
[16:35] you rest
[16:37] all right foreign to us was the gospel
[16:39] preached as well as to them but the word
[16:44] preached did not profit them didn't
[16:47] profit Israel did profit them people in
[16:49] Egypt right not being mixed with faith
[16:52] in them that heard it this is my fault
[17:02] Israel I'd almost say the faithless but
[17:09] Israel every time you saw in the Bible
[17:12] Jesus never looked at Israelite and said
[17:15] you have great things he always
[17:17] unbraided them for being weak the
[17:20] Gentiles now every time he walked by
[17:22] Gentiles and I've never found such faith
[17:24] in Israel so what happened this God
[17:28] wanted a people of faith first he was
[17:32] not he did not find faith in Israel they
[17:35] always had to have a sign they'll always
[17:37] have that wonder they always have that's
[17:39] why they've got to have two prophets
[17:42] their dependence is as Moses I'm
[17:45] actually their dependence is Elijah's
[17:47] coming back well when they see that sure
[17:50] it will make their faith rise up but
[17:51] there they're just they gotta have
[17:53] something yeah you know the Jews have
[17:56] always going to have this
[17:57] that's why they got in a wilderness
[17:58] thing you know they didn't look at the
[18:01] miracle of the bread coming down out of
[18:03] heaven yeah they looked at it was just
[18:07] ready so give us some meat God give him
[18:10] for me but he killed them for giving
[18:11] them to me you never throw you know in
[18:14] other words they should have been
[18:16] satisfied with what they had and they
[18:19] didn't have enough faith because what
[18:21] happened to the ten spies beside the two
[18:23] we know Joshua and Caleb which was good
[18:25] but the other ten say what we don't have
[18:29] enough faith to make it over that's
[18:30] basically what they were saying they and
[18:32] say we'll see what to do they went the
[18:34] circumstances manner tall is this their
[18:36] this is that that this is this we can't
[18:39] do it well that wasn't mixed with faith
[18:41] Joshua and Caleb had enough faith I
[18:43] believe to go over right then but they
[18:46] couldn't go over because of the people
[18:50] [Music]
[18:52] for weebly 10 believed do enter into
[18:54] rest so we've entered in and I've sold
[18:57] we've entered into rest as he said as I
[19:00] have sworn in my wrath if they shall
[19:02] enter into my rest although the works
[19:05] were finished from the foundation of the
[19:07] world it was done before God they store
[19:09] [Music]
[19:11] for he spake in a certain place of the
[19:13] seventh day
[19:14] no brother alcove was this good remember
[19:16] he had seventh-day Adventist sitting in
[19:18] his congregation Joey had to cover this
[19:21] for he spoke in a certain place of the
[19:23] seventh day on this wise and God did
[19:25] rest the seventh day from all his works
[19:27] and in this place again if you shall
[19:30] enter into my rest in other words he
[19:31] stayed in one place that in one place he
[19:34] said this all right seeing therefore it
[19:38] remaineth that some must enter therein
[19:40] and they to whom it was first preached
[19:43] entered not in because of unbelief in
[19:45] other words God give them a seventh day
[19:48] or a Sabbath to rest they do then rest
[19:54] oh yeah sure writing first they did but
[19:58] not not later on but he's telling them
[20:03] you entered into their own rest
[20:05] because there's a group of people they
[20:06] God's talking about if you'll enter into
[20:09] my rest
[20:10] seven days a week first preached entered
[20:13] not in because of unbelief again he
[20:15] limited a certain day saying he David
[20:18] today after so long the time as it is
[20:21] said today if you will hear my voice
[20:22] harden not your heart I look for if
[20:26] Jesus had given them rest
[20:28] then when he done afterwards have spoken
[20:29] of another day there's not Jesus wasn't
[20:34] speaking of a day he was says come to me
[20:36] all the labor heavy laden I'll give you
[20:39] rest there remaineth therefore a rest to
[20:43] the people of God which is what the new
[20:46] birth that's the rest for the people of
[20:48] God for he that has entered into his
[20:51] rest he also has ceased from his own
[20:54] words as God did from his in other words
[20:56] like I said last night like I said
[21:00] before my own works I in my body in my
[21:08] spirit realm
[21:09] I do the works of God okay
[21:16] and what they now in my soul my soul is
[21:21] not toiling my soul is at rest yes your
[21:27] soul is at rest by the new birth your
[21:28] soul is totally at rest
[21:30] all right look you cease from your own
[21:33] words
[21:34] that's why because now you're the
[21:36] middleman the
[21:38] the soul is sealed it carries you all
[21:41] the way through the if you have to go by
[21:46] the grave through the resurrection
[21:47] through the body change up into the
[21:51] wedding supper down in the morn him four
[21:54] thousand years
[21:55] you're covered all through that and then
[21:57] at the day of judgment you do not stand
[22:00] in judgment to be judged you stand
[22:03] complete in him so if you're born again
[22:06] see your package here your deal goes all
[22:09] the way it's not a day and it's not
[22:11] something you cease from except for
[22:14] yourself
[22:16] because God rested the seventh day but
[22:18] remember man fell in the seventh day
[22:21] though really God did rest I mean - wait
[22:26] we think you know like like one brother
[22:28] said one time do you think we'll
[22:30] everybody's God rested on seven days my
[22:32] man I'm tired I'm gonna rest this day he
[22:34] went no more time it was when he said
[22:36] let there be all them bigger the stars
[22:37] and all the other stuff he just made a
[22:39] day to stop catch your breath and take
[22:44] off again cuz it doesn't stop the day
[22:47] just keep going to the very next day
[22:48] okay if I got that same way with the
[22:52] Lord he's not rested yeah but he's but
[22:54] we better and you know like sometimes we
[22:56] look at our life when we go man if this
[22:59] is rest I don't well but you remember
[23:01] the pieces on the inside we're down on
[23:04] the inside that piece is there and like
[23:06] I said before we can talk about you know
[23:11] I get you here and it's okay don't get
[23:14] me wrong people talk about what's the
[23:16] twinkling of an eye
[23:17] what's of this and you know question we
[23:20] have questions last night's different
[23:22] ones that to me if I'm born again I'm
[23:24] really all I'm concerned with is getting
[23:28] meat to the body that's it I don't care
[23:31] what we're gonna eat at three and a half
[23:33] years into wedding supper
[23:34] I don't care in a millennium how are we
[23:36] gonna live I really don't and he said
[23:40] well yeah you do well yeah I do but I
[23:41] don't cook I'm resting in here this is
[23:45] at rest I don't have to worry about that
[23:47] you look at people they they they just
[23:50] get real
[23:55] what's gonna be the new CD how can we
[23:57] fit all the people in the world what
[23:59] does it matter
[24:02] god someone is already done
[24:04] don't you think for the foundation world
[24:05] he knew how big the world's gonna be and
[24:07] how many people is gonna be there
[24:08] comedian okay so he made it just exactly
[24:11] the right dimension so he can't change
[24:15] it cuz he turned alright so I don't
[24:19] worry about that I don't know I'm
[24:24] looking toward the voice of the
[24:25] Resurrection you know me I'm that's what
[24:27] I'm gonna
[24:28] looking toward that I can get if we can
[24:30] get on to a place to where the dead come
[24:33] among us then you know our job is done
[24:38] because the thing inside of me like I
[24:40] said that thing is that capsule is gonna
[24:42] carry me all the way the Futurama
[24:43] I don't have to Bill you know we're
[24:46] talking about building something wing
[24:47] him what does it matter doesn't matter
[24:51] you study aboard again no nail that
[24:52] thing down now and yeah but we do know
[24:57] have to know how to get to the light
[24:59] chain so we don't have to pick through
[25:01] some of this stuff not only be picky I
[25:03] mean pick through you know get the
[25:05] things that we need but we've already
[25:07] entered into our rest that's one Paul's
[25:09] trying to tell me we've entered into
[25:12] arrest by the Newburgh not by works he
[25:15] also has seized from his homework so you
[25:18] and I don't ever if we're born again and
[25:21] have to deal with our works our work
[25:25] should be our face expressed but we
[25:26] still are human beings and we do things
[25:28] and do things wrong but not doctrinally
[25:33] by the Newburg you should be able to say
[25:36] amen to the word right let us the labor
[25:40] of therefore lamb and Paul let us labor
[25:44] here in arrest
[25:45] it looks like he's kind of it looks like
[25:48] he's he's let her sleep her doing enter
[25:52] into rest and we do its birth pains like
[25:56] I've been speaking my son you are linked
[25:59] in tonight this afternoon to if I keep
[26:02] you all awake let us labor therefore to
[26:06] enter into that rest lest any man fall
[26:10] after the same example of unbelief what
[26:14] works your own works will kill you you
[26:18] can work yourself physically to death
[26:20] and you can work yourself mentally today
[26:22] alright somewhere there's got to be a
[26:25] rest for the believer and it's got to be
[26:28] that soul part of you watch on here cuz
[26:31] I love Hebrews 4:12
[26:34] for the Word of God is quick and
[26:37] powerful let's see what they work quick
[26:40] is living where the Word of God is
[26:45] living and powerful and sharper than any
[26:51] two-edged sword piercing even to the
[26:53] dividing asunder of soul and spirit what
[26:56] was he just talking about he's telling
[26:58] you that your rest is in your soul you
[27:00] got to divide that out because our
[27:02] problem is in our spirit round that's
[27:05] where we wrestled is in that spirit
[27:07] realm of man and sharper than a
[27:10] two-edged sword piercing even to the
[27:11] dividing asunder of soul and spirit and
[27:13] of the joints and marrow that is
[27:16] reflection and is a discerner of the
[27:18] thoughts and intents of the heart
[27:20] are the thoughts and intentions of the
[27:24] heart
[27:25] all right neither is there any creature
[27:27] that is not manifest in his side but all
[27:31] things are naked enough know which can't
[27:32] hide anything go but all things are
[27:35] naked and open unto the eyes of him with
[27:37] whom we have to do little words like see
[27:40] you can't because you can work have your
[27:42] works have your works have your works
[27:44] but something not be riding your heart
[27:46] sing that's for the denominational world
[27:48] and all the other worlds got all
[27:49] backwards there trying to clean the
[27:52] outside person up and we did in the
[27:54] message for a long long time try to
[27:56] clean the outside of it and quit
[27:57] preaching on the new birth we preached
[27:59] on hair and dress and clothes and TVs
[28:02] Christmas trees and this and that and
[28:04] you dress you got to be so much longer
[28:06] this way you can't show your neckline
[28:08] you can't do this that's what we got to
[28:11] come through all right that was our
[28:14] wilderness journey but it's been more
[28:17] than 40 years since our probably so
[28:19] quick with a little bit slower even than
[28:20] the children of Israel hmm neither is
[28:25] there any creature that is not manifest
[28:27] in the south they're all naked seeing
[28:29] then that we have a great high priests
[28:33] now what's Paul he's some Isaac remember
[28:36] everything Paul does he's a scholar he
[28:40] makes his dissertation or his speech and
[28:43] then
[28:44] he puts it in a little big compartment
[28:47] and says this is what I was talking
[28:49] about because what see then we have a
[28:52] great Humphrey
[28:53] flap we're going to be judged by the
[28:55] high priest works not out the children
[28:59] of Israel were judged temporarily in the
[29:03] Old Testament temporarily they were
[29:05] judged by the high priest because if an
[29:08] high priest didn't go in the correct way
[29:11] Israel sins didn't get forgiven but if
[29:15] he did the right thing see same thing
[29:17] with Christ Christ is a high priest this
[29:21] one passed into the heavens and he come
[29:23] back on the dead Pentecost
[29:26] but those priests would go in once a
[29:28] year covered it is real sin so Israel
[29:32] depended on the works of the high
[29:33] priests well we depend on the works of
[29:35] our high priest who is perfect Jesus
[29:37] Christ that is passed into the heavens
[29:39] Jesus the Son of God let us hold fast
[29:42] our profession but we have not an High
[29:45] Priest which cannot be touched with the
[29:47] feeling of our infirmities but was in
[29:50] all points tempted like us like as we
[29:53] are yet without sin so Jesus Christ was
[29:56] tempted just like we were and and I want
[30:01] you to understand something
[30:03] there's therefore come boldly into the
[30:05] throne of grace that we may obtain mercy
[30:07] and find grace to help in time of need
[30:08] let's go back to Jesus now he came here
[30:12] on earth it wasn't that sin rolled off
[30:16] of him like water off a duck's back
[30:19] because it enter into entered into his
[30:21] brain is his human brain he processed
[30:25] what he saw right I kind of think of a
[30:31] way to bring this I locked you long
[30:32] going I kind of forgot it and that's
[30:34] come back but for we have not an High
[30:38] Priest which cannot be touched with the
[30:39] feeling of our infirmities but was in
[30:41] all points tempted like as we are yet
[30:43] without sin so the temptation came he
[30:48] was so human that the temptation
[30:50] bother it didn't bother Satan because
[30:53] surely didn't get tempted by God he
[30:55] wasn't done he was tempted by the demons
[30:58] that was around him
[30:59] all right he was tempted in other words
[31:03] there was a decision in his brain he
[31:05] processed when he saw all right now we
[31:10] always say let me see if I can get this
[31:13] right we always say if you ride a
[31:15] bicycle what happens science tells you
[31:17] when you ride a bicycle or you do
[31:19] something repetitive driving a car that
[31:21] the ends of your that the ends of your
[31:23] nerves in your brain come together and
[31:25] they lock and that gives you your memory
[31:28] so you can the receptors keep firing the
[31:30] same way so if you get on a bicycle or a
[31:32] motorcycle or or wait ten years you get
[31:34] over another bicycle you you've already
[31:36] got that in your brain nobody got that
[31:41] what about Jesus he had a human brain
[31:46] yet he was to hold the Holy Ghost you
[31:48] have in your soul today it's the same
[31:53] Holy Ghost that process his thoughts
[31:56] while he was human if I got that he
[32:02] processed those same things the Holy
[32:06] Ghost inside of him processed that
[32:08] because he was without sin he would stop
[32:11] you and I didn't have the Holy Ghost
[32:12] they don't stop we didn't stop it he had
[32:15] the Holy Ghost from the beginning that's
[32:17] why he could stop it but what happened
[32:19] when the Holy Ghost I and I know I don't
[32:21] want to get on the point of God having
[32:24] to learn something but the Bible said
[32:27] that Jesus learned by the things that he
[32:30] suffered and being made perfect I'm not
[32:34] saying the Holy Ghost tonight the Holy
[32:36] Ghost is perfection
[32:38] it's eternal but but it never was a
[32:43] human being like that until Jesus came
[32:46] on earth tell me what he was I mean even
[32:50] when he just stepped melcat so that he
[32:52] just stepped into a body talk to Abraham
[32:55] stepped right out Jesus Christ lived
[32:57] baby life a teenage life a middle-aged
[33:01] life and thirty year going up to thirty
[33:04] years old he lived that life what I'm
[33:06] saying is if he can be touched by the
[33:09] finger my infirmities but was in all
[33:12] points tempted like as we are yet
[33:15] without sin the Holy Ghost he had inside
[33:18] of him did not I'm trying to get this
[33:23] right it's not to be to learn this but
[33:25] remember what I'm saying it trying to
[33:27] try to say is you and I have the new
[33:28] birth today right it's the same Holy
[33:31] Ghost that was in that body called Jesus
[33:33] that's how we can handle things now as
[33:37] human beings it's because the Holy Ghost
[33:40] was a human being at one time and had to
[33:42] process through a human gray matter
[33:44] brain called Jesus had to process this
[33:48] that's why if we drink beer if we cursed
[33:52] we don't do that because what happened
[33:54] did that got burned out and the Holy
[33:57] Ghost comes in when now the problem
[33:58] there is we like the Holy Ghost come in
[34:01] but we still like brother Dale always
[34:05] said he hated beer but he says he got
[34:07] born again I was some part the other day
[34:09] and same thing happened this happens
[34:18] I'll tell you where it's at remember I
[34:21] told you in that motel that I stayed in
[34:22] I opened up the refrigerator and there
[34:24] with Seagram's Jack Daniels something
[34:29] other kind of liquor and beer all in the
[34:31] cabinet it was right there and you go
[34:34] shut the door back you know but now me
[34:38] before I've got one other man made me in
[34:41] a dream you understand what I'm saying
[34:42] but that thought always catches you in
[34:45] comes but what happens is the Holy Ghost
[34:46] that was in Jesus is in you now
[34:51] overcoming the same thing and so I'm
[34:53] trying to say it knows how to overcome
[34:55] it he did that well he's all-knowing no
[34:57] he had to be a human man here
[34:59] be a human mortal man to feel these
[35:01] things touched by the feeling of our
[35:03] infirmities the Holy Ghost inside you
[35:06] feels what Jesus went through when he
[35:08] was on earth and then that it takes care
[35:12] of the things that we do don't make any
[35:13] same thing to me that makes the Holy
[35:15] Ghost more more personal than just this
[35:19] great God up here that that finally
[35:22] sends this one little drop will be turn
[35:23] alive down in your soul and boom you're
[35:25] just eternal know if he learn about
[35:29] things he stuff we're gonna learn by the
[35:31] things we suffer but he's suffered them
[35:33] and learned them first right so being a
[35:35] high priest who want the high priest
[35:37] gets everything first they can be
[35:40] touched by the feeling the line furmity
[35:42] all points tempted so let us therefore
[35:45] come boldly to the throne life can we
[35:47] come boldly to the throne because we
[35:49] have the one sitting on the throne
[35:51] inside us able to protect us through the
[35:56] life that we live to where we lead them
[35:59] back on the Holy Ghost not on the now
[36:02] the old nature we lean toward the Holy
[36:04] Ghost the Holy Ghost said this is what
[36:06] you do come this is what happened to me
[36:08] when I was when I was on earth to me
[36:10] that humanizes it makes the Holy Ghost
[36:12] more personal to me instead of just this
[36:15] spot that you know the day I got born
[36:17] again they was just whirling little spot
[36:20] that comes in you know dicks in here and
[36:22] I'm eternal know you still I wished it
[36:25] was that my waist it was that easy right
[36:28] oh it was that easy but it's not Jesus
[36:31] still had to live a life that he
[36:33] suffered all right now he's suffered
[36:36] persecution Thank You temple when he
[36:38] believed cuz look this right here no
[36:43] more they won't stop for every high
[36:44] please taken from among men is ordained
[36:48] for men and the things pertaining to God
[36:53] that he may offer both gifts and
[36:56] sacrifices for sin watch this who can
[36:58] have compassion on the aedra how can we
[37:01] have compassion on the ignorant which is
[37:04] the unlearning the people that don't
[37:06] learn because there's something inside
[37:08] of us
[37:09] there's teaching us and all
[37:10] them that are out of the way for the
[37:13] himself also is compassed with infirmity
[37:16] and by reason here of we he ought as for
[37:21] the people so often for himself to offer
[37:24] percent and no man taketh this honor
[37:29] unto himself not everybody to be hungry
[37:33] but he that is called to God as was
[37:36] Aaron in other words God called Aaron to
[37:40] be the high pre-night so also Christ
[37:43] glorified not himself to be made in high
[37:46] priest but he they said unto him that my
[37:49] son today have I begotten thee as he
[37:53] offset also no place that were to priest
[37:55] forever after the order of melchizedek
[37:58] who in the days of his flesh when he had
[38:01] offered up prayers and supplication with
[38:02] strong crying in tears unto him that was
[38:04] able to save him from death that was
[38:06] hurt and that he feared though he were a
[38:08] son what we was talking about this yet
[38:13] learned the obedience he obedience by
[38:16] the things which he suffered and being
[38:19] made perfect he became the author of
[38:22] eternal salvation unto all them that
[38:24] obey me in other words Paul is
[38:29] summarizing the whole thing he said
[38:31] remember he said the word is a discerner
[38:33] of the thoughts and intents of the heart
[38:35] the joint the Marilyn sold in the spirit
[38:37] and now that that's inside of you you're
[38:41] being made perfect has Christ like I
[38:43] said Christ had me grow in grace and
[38:45] knowledge being made perfect called with
[38:49] God and high priest after the order of
[38:52] Melchizedek and then we read that later
[38:55] on buddy we're gonna stop right here
[38:57] just say something from me so there he
[39:00] were though he were a son yet learned he
[39:03] will be against by the things which he
[39:04] suffered hey this is all talking about
[39:09] Christ though he were a son yet learned
[39:12] he'll be as month into sin and be made
[39:14] perfect he became the author of eternal
[39:17] salvation and all them that obey me so
[39:20] in other words it wasn't it it wasn't
[39:23] this
[39:24] one that he wasn't in the tournament he
[39:26] was he currently have you colonel inside
[39:27] a bikini he became the author of our
[39:30] book the author of our humanity than our
[39:34] humanity because remember look you can't
[39:37] understand this guy here they tried the
[39:40] Old Testament they they tried many times
[39:42] but now when God came down into this man
[39:45] and became the son of man a man a man
[39:47] was blood they could walk through life
[39:50] that we see many times going through
[39:54] life and remember when he went to the
[39:56] Garden of Gethsemane he was there was
[39:58] something inside of him that I don't
[40:00] know if it feared death but he said can
[40:03] this cup pass from me he there was
[40:05] something in there that he was going
[40:06] I've never walked this path right here
[40:08] before we know the anointing left him so
[40:11] he couldn't die so he felt he felt more
[40:14] human I guess than any time in his life
[40:16] but yet he was the most God that was God
[40:18] brother Graham said brother Ram said he
[40:20] had overcome on the cross he overcome
[40:24] and Gethsemane right yes lemon is when
[40:26] he overcome because when he said not my
[40:28] will but thy will be done
[40:29] alright so he overcame at Gethsemane and
[40:34] then the cross was a culmination of of
[40:37] him laying it all down and said I I
[40:40] gotta do this in issue Manatee he had to
[40:45] die now the rest of him didn't die but
[40:48] in his humanity hadn't died to release
[40:50] that life that he had though who our son
[40:54] learned he obedience by the things which
[40:57] he suffered and being made perfect will
[41:01] cover that a little bit more next Sunday
[41:02] question God was
[41:10] Jesus no I didn't suffer no no he
[41:21] suffered in his body in suffer and
[41:24] suffer in his his remember now that his
[41:29] spirit was just what we read back over
[41:34] here in Hebrews one his spirit was the
[41:37] Holy Spirit right if not then we need a
[41:40] no spit then he was just a man spirit no
[41:42] no no no God looks under time the divers
[41:45] manners spake in time past father's by
[41:46] the prophets happened these last days
[41:48] spoken to us by son whom he has
[41:50] appointed heir of all things by whom
[41:51] also he made the world alright so he
[41:54] died inside of him was it's told was
[42:02] Almighty God oh yeah in his spirit realm
[42:08] so where was all the confusion
[42:15] in his human part he had a human brain
[42:18] that that had to filter to us what I'm
[42:19] just trying to explain he had that human
[42:22] brain had to filter through the things
[42:26] they had to process things the problem
[42:28] of you and I are the things that we
[42:29] process in our spirit realm is carnal
[42:36] just time to go just a bit listen Jesus
[42:41] did not have a carnal mind he was not
[42:43] born of sex of a woman and a man so
[42:46] there was nothing for him to look back
[42:48] and say I was born he was born right he
[42:51] was the Holy Ghost he was the very God
[42:54] Almighty in human flesh all right but he
[42:57] had a human part of it not to people but
[43:00] he had he was a body he had a brain that
[43:02] had to process all that what I was just
[43:04] saying he processed by the Holy Ghost
[43:06] that's what didn't let him sin because
[43:10] even with the Holy Ghost in our soul we
[43:13] sinned in our favor because we're not
[43:16] like him in that way we're heading
[43:18] toward that because the change will
[43:20] bring us into that but that's the
[43:21] difference in man him I was born with a
[43:24] human nature a carnal nature contrary to
[43:27] God he was not he was gone but he had to
[43:31] process things through that human and by
[43:33] unguided the gray matter do you have in
[43:35] your head he still God had the process 3
[43:37] that because he was down here in the
[43:40] memory I mean sorry CJ still smelling
[43:42] here and to process that as a human
[43:44] being he processed all dafter a human
[43:47] brain that he'd never done before God he
[43:49] never processed that through a human
[43:51] brain before so he's processing the food
[43:53] human brain but he had at a low because
[43:55] he had the Holy Ghost he was God
[43:57] Almighty because can't separate we gotta
[44:00] go
[44:00] no I don't know
