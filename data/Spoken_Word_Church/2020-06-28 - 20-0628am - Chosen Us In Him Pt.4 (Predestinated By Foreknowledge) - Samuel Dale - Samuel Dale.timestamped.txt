[5:56] blessed be the god and father of our
[5:57] lord jesus christ who has blessed us
[5:59] with all spiritual blessings
[6:01] in heavenly places in christ
[6:04] according as he had chosen us in him
[6:07] when before the foundation of the world
[6:09] that we should be holy and without blame
[6:11] before him in love
[6:13] having predestinated us unto the
[6:16] adoption of children by jesus christ to
[6:18] himself according to the good pleasure
[6:20] of his will to the praise of the glory
[6:23] of his grace wherein he hath made us
[6:25] accepted in the beloved okay let's go to
[6:29] romans
[6:30] 8 29.
[6:34] we'll read 28 while you're getting 28.
[6:37] uh and we know that all things work
[6:39] together for good to them that love god
[6:42] to them who are the called according to
[6:44] his purpose
[6:45] for whom he did for no he also did
[6:48] predestinate
[6:50] to be conformed to the image of his son
[6:52] that he might be the firstborn among
[6:54] many brethren
[6:56] moreover whom he did predestinate them
[6:59] he also called
[7:01] in whom he called then he also justified
[7:05] me
[7:06] and whom he justified them he also
[7:08] glorified okay we'll go over to
[7:11] pick up verse
[7:13] 11 just pick up verse 2
[7:17] god hath not cast away his people
[7:19] which he foreknew because see we're
[7:22] going to be dealing with foreknowledge
[7:24] for no for knowledge for new
[7:27] all right
[7:29] what ye not that the scripture saith
[7:30] isaias
[7:31] that he that maketh the intercession of
[7:33] god against israel saying
[7:35] um okay you can be seated and we just
[7:39] get on into the
[7:40] part because we're wanting to
[7:42] stay with the subject
[7:45] because i want you to
[7:47] and i'm going to just do slow reading
[7:49] today to try to end this up because i
[7:52] want you to make sure that you know
[7:55] we've got some visitors coming in and
[7:57] also you know i think they've been here
[7:59] before but anyhow
[8:01] no one has but good to see you amen but
[8:04] welcome all right now
[8:06] i want you to understand where i stand
[8:10] because of what i believe because you
[8:12] know
[8:13] uh
[8:14] that's the best way to say it i don't
[8:16] know you say well are you right or wrong
[8:18] no i try to be right but the word is
[8:21] right
[8:22] that's the part that's right is the word
[8:24] so then if we stay with the word
[8:26] then we have to be staying with the
[8:28] right understanding
[8:30] and everything will will be in the
[8:32] correct order but i want you to to just
[8:35] keep in your mind one thing you say well
[8:37] brother dale do you believe in
[8:39] predestination
[8:41] all right now i'm going to say this over
[8:43] and over and over i believe in
[8:45] predestination
[8:47] by for knowledge
[8:51] all right so now we're going to read
[8:52] these because sometimes i don't read
[8:55] them in things and i just leave it but
[8:57] i'm going to read through them and at
[8:59] least that way you will know what the
[9:00] prophet has said what the bible has said
[9:03] and you'll know that that's what i
[9:04] believe i believe that those who he
[9:07] that he does not predestinate will read
[9:09] by his desires no
[9:11] right
[9:13] if anything he'd be predestinating by
[9:14] your desires
[9:16] amen because he can look and see him but
[9:19] that's what we want to stay with the
[9:20] point he said well what do you believe i
[9:22] believe in foreknowledge knowledge
[9:24] before which comes first then amen
[9:29] which comes first predestination or
[9:31] knowledge
[9:32] for knowledge comes first
[9:34] then he predestinates by that
[9:37] so that's i want that in your mind i
[9:39] want that dwelling within us and then
[9:42] because see there's another message
[9:44] coming on behind this
[9:46] that uh we must get into and i ask you
[9:49] to read or listen to christ is the
[9:52] mystery of god revealed and we'll get in
[9:55] there where that god had a plan and a
[9:58] purpose
[10:00] all right we want to get into that part
[10:02] because then you're going to see
[10:03] predestination move into a little bit
[10:06] of a different avenue
[10:08] maybe than what you generally think of
[10:11] it even by reading that
[10:14] for knowledge and predestination we're
[10:15] going to roll we're going to roll into
[10:18] god's mind
[10:20] and see if we can can be able to
[10:22] understand so read the message or listen
[10:24] to
[10:25] christ is the mystery of god reveal all
[10:28] right so that way you'll have it in your
[10:31] understanding so which comes first now
[10:33] predestination
[10:34] no
[10:36] for knowledge
[10:38] now listen to my point
[10:41] if you think that predestination comes
[10:43] first
[10:45] then you're predetermined
[10:49] now now listen what i'm saying then once
[10:51] you read here what the prophet says that
[10:53] ain't right then you're gonna you're
[10:55] gonna go when he said i don't believe in
[10:58] you know in this i don't believe in that
[11:01] i don't believe that he's
[11:02] he predestinates the way we think
[11:05] so see
[11:07] now if you bring it in the correct order
[11:08] see then you'll get it to where you can
[11:10] see the foreknowledge
[11:14] as that will go us back as far as can go
[11:19] predetermined is going that away
[11:22] [Music]
[11:23] you know a destiny determined
[11:26] to go to all right so then that way
[11:28] you'll understand and you won't be doing
[11:30] but if you go to predestination first
[11:32] now everybody listening you go to
[11:34] predestination you say well i'm a firm
[11:36] believer in predestination i believe
[11:38] we're this predestinated seed we'll get
[11:41] into that
[11:42] i believe in that
[11:44] but i believe as the prophet said it's
[11:46] not the person that comes predestinated
[11:48] eternally from god it's the word or seed
[11:51] or i believe that just as much as i
[11:52] believe that he predestinates by his
[11:55] foreknowledge
[11:56] because that's the only way i can get it
[11:58] together
[11:59] and keep it together to where i can
[12:01] conceive because if not if
[12:02] predestination comes first then your
[12:05] destiny is determined
[12:08] you would not have anything to do with
[12:09] it
[12:11] it would be predetermined
[12:13] but if you go to foreknowledge amen
[12:17] see
[12:17] faker predetermined but let it be that
[12:20] he foreknew
[12:24] and then he could set the destiny
[12:27] because all mankind it doesn't matter
[12:28] who there is a destiny set for everybody
[12:32] now that's that's not a predestination
[12:35] of a presbyterian or a baptist or
[12:38] whatever that is that's not that away
[12:40] not thinking on that well is it this is
[12:42] i can't do nothing about it
[12:45] well if that's what you think you can't
[12:46] do nothing about it
[12:49] i'll agree with you if you say i can't
[12:51] do nothing about it god determined my
[12:53] destiny no
[12:55] no god didn't determine your destiny
[13:00] you determine your destiny
[13:03] all right
[13:04] see then that way we'll hold it to the
[13:06] line to where we can walk with the word
[13:08] of god okay so let's start reading a few
[13:11] things that the prophet had to say and
[13:13] like i said i want to read them
[13:16] and i want you to listen
[13:18] and and just pay close attention as to
[13:21] what is being said go ahead number one
[13:23] which is on the message the super sign
[13:26] these are the notes that you'll look
[13:28] you'll see that we've given these about
[13:30] three times in a row but i want you to
[13:32] listen
[13:33] i want you to read and listen
[13:37] and see what he says
[13:38] and then the prophet is the one the word
[13:40] came to so it didn't come to me in you
[13:43] we had it all messed up everybody's
[13:45] right all right
[13:46] we had a predestination it was like
[13:49] well i'm glad i fell off of that thing i
[13:52] got that over with now
[13:55] i don't have to do that no more
[13:58] see that's our we try to make it some
[14:00] silly form
[14:01] of a predetermining
[14:04] just listen to what i said
[14:06] if you go to predetermining first
[14:08] then you're believing in pre-existence
[14:12] you would have to be if you go to
[14:14] predetermined first you go to four
[14:16] knowledge first
[14:18] then a destiny says you're not
[14:19] pre-existent right
[14:21] right
[14:23] all right so if you want to believe in
[14:24] pre-existence
[14:26] what do you believe
[14:28] i believe now listen
[14:31] i believe in a pre-existence
[14:33] of a predestinated seed right
[14:38] yes
[14:40] but that's the word amen
[14:42] i believe in a predestinated word i
[14:44] believe each age has a word
[14:46] laid down for that age
[14:49] i believe that
[14:50] because that's and it's predetermined to
[14:52] be there but what was it predetermined
[14:54] by
[14:56] before knowledge
[14:58] that he knows what we'll have nato
[15:00] [Music]
[15:01] all right see then we we've got the
[15:03] whole thing but it's right the way the
[15:05] listen to the prophet like a brother
[15:06] said the other day he said i don't see a
[15:08] hand in the world
[15:09] anybody can think about it said it's
[15:11] just so simple to me
[15:13] i said well that's that's what i think
[15:15] it's simple to me god
[15:18] knows if he doesn't know
[15:21] he's not god
[15:23] all right that solves that but if he
[15:25] predetermines
[15:27] in any other form then by his
[15:29] foreknowledge
[15:30] then he's a respecter person
[15:33] and he doesn't do that right
[15:35] okay so now let's get with the with it
[15:37] and go from the message superstar god
[15:39] knowed the end from the beginning
[15:40] therefore he could plan everything
[15:44] that it would work out just to his glory
[15:46] and we'll get back to god's plan and
[15:48] purpose on the christ the mystery that
[15:49] so listen to that right there
[15:51] and that gives us courage to know that
[15:53] no matter what comes or goes
[15:56] god is making everything
[15:59] you know what
[16:00] the clock is ticking just exactly on
[16:03] time
[16:05] sometimes we get weary upset we get
[16:07] hastily
[16:09] we think oh we must do this or do that
[16:12] but remember god's clock will be just
[16:15] exactly on time
[16:17] all these things has to be this way
[16:19] it has to all be done according to his
[16:23] great
[16:24] knowledge
[16:26] his foreknowledge for before knowledge
[16:28] he could predestinate
[16:30] not by his desire
[16:33] but by his knowledge
[16:35] god doesn't predestinate by his desire
[16:38] he is not willing that any should perish
[16:41] but by his foreknowledge okay now that
[16:43] solves the problem
[16:45] he's not willing he's not predestinating
[16:47] by his desires
[16:49] well you're just in the old days of
[16:51] predestination
[16:53] we're up in this fancy revelation for
[16:55] the hour
[16:56] well
[16:59] okay do what you want to i'm i'm just
[17:02] stating what i believe and that'll be
[17:04] left at that
[17:06] all right
[17:07] now watch then
[17:09] he is not willing that any should perish
[17:12] see if he
[17:13] pre-predestinated before he before
[17:16] knowledge
[17:17] he would be predetermining
[17:21] and see
[17:23] it won't work okay keep that in mind now
[17:26] as we go along
[17:28] he is not willing that any should perish
[17:30] but by his knowledge he knew who would
[17:32] accept it and who would not therefore he
[17:35] can make everything work according to
[17:38] his big time clock
[17:40] that's ticking away for he could
[17:43] foretell the end from the beginning and
[17:45] therefore he knew
[17:47] that we would live in this day
[17:50] he knew that this would be our day he
[17:53] had plans for this day he had had plans
[17:56] for every day and never has one of his
[17:58] plans ever failed he is always on time
[18:03] okay
[18:04] all right
[18:06] now see we're going to get down when we
[18:08] we get back on to that of uh you know
[18:11] we'll get back to the scripture that we
[18:13] read
[18:14] where he's the predestinated
[18:18] sure
[18:19] he predestinates a group of people
[18:23] he sure does
[18:25] but it's by therefore knowledge right
[18:27] now
[18:29] he said but i don't have anything to do
[18:31] with my salvation brother dale because
[18:33] you proved it and put in there and said
[18:36] that we didn't choose him he chose us
[18:38] well that's true he chose us
[18:43] but is there any problem with choosing
[18:45] for his foreknowledge that he chose us
[18:47] because he knew we'd choose him
[18:49] any problem with that
[18:52] well then is he watching what we're
[18:54] doing yeah
[18:55] and see we think we'll get to it in a
[18:57] minute that he just puts us in a pot and
[18:59] pushes us through the other end of it
[19:01] well if he does that's predetermining
[19:03] everything
[19:04] it's not giving you a choice right
[19:07] i believe you have a choice
[19:11] you must accept jesus christ as your
[19:13] savior
[19:16] if you don't accept him as your savior
[19:18] then you're the one that's got the
[19:20] problem
[19:22] so you're predetermining god's not
[19:26] he gives you a choice
[19:29] all right
[19:29] make your calling an election sure go
[19:31] ahead number number two because this is
[19:34] romans
[19:35] uh
[19:36] 11 32 for god hath concluded them all in
[19:40] unbelief
[19:42] that you might have mercy upon all
[19:45] now i brought that in because of the
[19:47] purpose
[19:48] of starting this this situation up to
[19:51] where most people think oh we're this
[19:53] special chosen people we're just and and
[19:57] we're not like them that old serpent
[19:59] seed can't be saved that old group
[20:01] that's the you know uh-uh
[20:07] god had concluded all
[20:10] right that's right
[20:14] amen
[20:15] and unbelief that he might have mercy
[20:17] upon all right
[20:21] any problem with that
[20:22] okay go ahead with number three
[20:29] which is from the message of god's
[20:31] covenant with abraham and his seat
[20:33] jesus didn't come to calvary just for a
[20:35] haphazard thought
[20:38] well i'll die there perhaps maybe
[20:40] somebody will feel sorry for me
[20:43] that's my brother he's a methodist
[20:45] minister and that's what he says
[20:47] he says god looked down and everything
[20:49] failed and said finally he said okay
[20:51] i'll just send my son let him die maybe
[20:54] somebody will accept it well boy that's
[20:57] i mean you know i told him i said
[21:00] uh
[21:01] i'd like to talk to you about an eternal
[21:03] god who has
[21:05] had never changed his mind amen
[21:07] but anyhow listen
[21:09] he said maybe you'll feel sorry and come
[21:11] down and get saved no no god don't run
[21:14] his office like that you don't run your
[21:16] office like that jesus come for the one
[21:18] specific purpose that was to redeem
[21:21] those that god foreknew would be
[21:24] redeemed
[21:25] solve the problem
[21:28] now god's not willing that any should
[21:30] perish i read a lot of do quote that and
[21:33] stop don't read this hearing that's the
[21:35] sign i was looking at i said i'm going
[21:37] to read every one of them word for word
[21:39] you know the whole thing amen
[21:42] god's not willing that any should perish
[21:44] but that all would come to repentance
[21:47] but in order to be god
[21:49] he had to know see
[21:51] he knew when he created mankind
[21:54] that we'd fall
[21:57] but that's part of his plan and purpose
[22:02] he had to have these attributes of
[22:03] savior healer etc
[22:05] but he knew
[22:07] well then
[22:09] he didn't give us a choice didn't give
[22:10] us a choice
[22:14] he put us here gave us a choice
[22:16] that's where i believe it you may doubt
[22:18] it whatever you want to do i believe
[22:20] cain had just as much a choice
[22:23] as abel did yes
[22:25] because if you don't make him with a
[22:26] choice you've got a problem
[22:29] amen
[22:30] yeah but god loved this one he loved me
[22:34] and he didn't love these others
[22:36] i'd hate to put it on thinking he loved
[22:38] me for something some
[22:40] work
[22:41] god's not willing that he should perish
[22:43] but all would come to repentance but in
[22:45] order to be god he had to know now the
[22:47] word predestinate
[22:50] it is used in ephesians 1 5 predestinate
[22:54] there isn't a good word because now this
[22:56] is the reason
[22:59] it means in speaking of predestination
[23:01] to the people sometimes leads them to
[23:04] think
[23:04] that god just predestinated you to push
[23:08] you through
[23:09] a little pipe or something
[23:12] that's what predestination of mankind
[23:15] runs to that's not what the prophet
[23:17] believed and that's one up not what i
[23:18] believe
[23:21] okay
[23:23] push you through the pipe or something
[23:26] that's not right predestination looks
[23:28] back to foreknowledge
[23:31] and foreknowledge looks to destiny now
[23:34] back to me means that away so you're
[23:36] going back to foreknowledge and destiny
[23:39] goes out in the front ways of you
[23:42] and there's a destiny set for all of us
[23:44] right
[23:46] god knew it
[23:49] and he didn't make us
[23:52] amen
[23:53] he made us with a free moral agency
[23:56] and he cannot override your free
[23:58] mortality yeah but look at paul he got
[24:00] nazi that's your old calvinistics and
[24:03] armenian doctrines and ideas coming down
[24:05] see they think oh paul will paul didn't
[24:07] have to do it god just knocked him down
[24:09] slapped him off without saved him anyway
[24:16] he slapped him down he knocked him
[24:18] around
[24:19] but he still had the choice
[24:24] you thank god for the choice
[24:27] what i'm trying to get you to see now if
[24:29] you don't get nothing out of the message
[24:31] i told you the other week that we would
[24:33] be one thought in mind
[24:35] for a while
[24:37] you have something to do with your
[24:39] salvation
[24:41] no i didn't have because you didn't sell
[24:43] me the prophet said then i didn't choose
[24:45] i didn't say it that way
[24:49] he gave you a choice
[24:51] amen but he knows your choice
[24:55] amen see i'm wanting you and i to
[24:58] realize that we do have something to do
[25:00] we have to accept our salvation
[25:03] and we can run all we want to on the the
[25:06] the choice was god's choice it wasn't
[25:08] mine well that's all right
[25:12] but remember
[25:15] he knew what you'd do
[25:18] you're going to have it on
[25:19] predetermining
[25:21] without given a choice
[25:24] i believe you have a choice you have a
[25:26] you have a right to accept jesus christ
[25:27] as your savior or reject him
[25:30] and god does according to what you
[25:32] desire on that that's right
[25:36] that's as simple as i can make
[25:37] predestination okay
[25:40] it says predestination looks back to
[25:42] foreknowledge
[25:44] and foreknowledge looks to destiny go
[25:46] ahead
[25:47] go ahead number four
[25:50] door to the heart
[25:52] that's the reason when paul speaks of it
[25:54] in corinthians there are romans he said
[25:57] before either child was born
[25:59] esau and jacob
[26:01] both
[26:02] were good holy parents
[26:05] god said
[26:06] i hate esau and love jacob
[26:10] that's his election that his election
[26:13] might stand true
[26:16] how many ever read that
[26:18] now you you can't believe an election
[26:20] you know
[26:21] just exactly what would happen certainly
[26:24] he's not willing
[26:26] but his foreknowledge lets him know
[26:29] he don't just say i'm going to save this
[26:33] and lose that one
[26:35] he wants all you all saved but it's for
[26:38] knowledge
[26:40] no
[26:40] who would so therefore he could
[26:43] predestinate
[26:45] according to the for to foreknowledge
[26:47] and that's election
[26:49] see that's you calling an election sure
[26:51] looking back jesus came
[26:53] and the last ones to be saved will be
[26:56] saved the church will
[26:58] what is it
[26:59] predestinate it
[27:03] by foreknowledge
[27:06] yes but brother dale that don't give me
[27:08] the thrill when brother so-and-so
[27:10] explains predestination i can just see
[27:13] myself back there uh running around up
[27:15] in heaven and i do
[27:17] you're a mormons
[27:19] i like that so right go ahead
[27:23] right you know
[27:25] but you don't have no scriptures for
[27:26] those things
[27:30] see you run off the scale remember
[27:32] that's what our point was
[27:34] if you ain't careful you'll run off
[27:35] scale this way or run off scale that way
[27:38] we don't want to run off on neither one
[27:39] right
[27:41] all right
[27:42] go ahead number five
[27:44] i just want to read these and then that
[27:46] way you'll know exactly where i stand
[27:48] and then we'll get into christ
[27:51] is a mystery and it may be surprising
[27:54] the approach that's taken because
[27:56] it has to be
[27:58] it has to be the way
[28:00] the word the resurrection messy the
[28:02] resurrection of jesus
[28:04] as well stated predestination looks back
[28:08] to foreknowledge
[28:09] and foreknowledge looks onto destiny
[28:11] that's simple amen
[28:15] god predestinates by his foreknowledge
[28:20] he doesn't predestinate by his desires
[28:25] see that's predetermining factor
[28:27] that won't work well now he chose me
[28:32] oh i just believe it i'm one of them
[28:33] seed
[28:34] but them old judases and things like
[28:36] that they don't have no
[28:38] no hope for them people
[28:41] well he concluded all under sin amen so
[28:44] if he made judas a sinner we're just as
[28:47] big a sinner as judas
[28:48] whether you like it or not no i'm not
[28:51] i'm i'm a i'm a predestinated seed
[28:53] brother dale
[28:59] where did you get it
[29:04] because if you're going to pre-determine
[29:05] it
[29:08] i'm going to state it again where you're
[29:10] listening
[29:11] if you're going to predetermine
[29:13] something
[29:14] be careful
[29:16] because if you're going to predetermine
[29:19] god in his doings
[29:21] then remember
[29:23] you ain't got a
[29:24] choice now remember
[29:28] there's no foreknowledge
[29:30] if you're going to predetermine it
[29:34] well i thought we was to be i thought we
[29:36] was this great seed that's the doctrine
[29:39] of the message
[29:42] that we come here with this seed in us
[29:46] where's it at
[29:47] that's all i asked a brother we was
[29:48] coming back from
[29:50] um
[29:51] fellowship a minister's meeting was
[29:52] having one time with his brother he he
[29:54] was laying on that i said well let's ask
[29:56] you one question
[29:57] where's the seed
[30:01] is it in your body your spirit of your
[30:03] soul where's the seed that's that's all
[30:05] i'm asking you
[30:07] i ain't talking to you
[30:09] i said yeah i know you ain't cause you
[30:10] don't have no answer for it
[30:14] you see
[30:16] where where's the seat at
[30:19] and remember your prophet said
[30:22] the seed was put there before the
[30:24] foundation of the world amen
[30:29] now what you have to do with any of it
[30:33] don't give you a choice
[30:35] you've got to be careful
[30:37] what's now
[30:38] well stated predestination looked back
[30:40] to foreign knowledge for knowledge looks
[30:41] to destiny all right
[30:44] and god in the beginning could see all
[30:46] things the way it would happen
[30:49] therefore he could tell
[30:51] this will be this way and that'll be
[30:53] that way and this will be this way and
[30:56] that way because he by for knowledge he
[31:00] wasn't willing that the left side in
[31:02] other words pointing out would be wrong
[31:05] that's this would be in other words left
[31:07] not in the right or not he didn't want
[31:10] that to happen
[31:11] but being god he knew it would happen
[31:14] that way
[31:15] so therefore he could foretell
[31:17] what would be
[31:19] and he knew the end from the beginning
[31:23] that wonderful and to think that every
[31:25] born-again child of god tonight
[31:28] has that privilege and assurance to know
[31:31] that god knoweth his own see that's
[31:34] right god knoweth his own
[31:38] that's that's what i don't understand
[31:43] well
[31:45] keep on reading go to number six
[31:46] [Music]
[31:49] this is from the message the power of
[31:51] god
[31:52] the word predestinate that's not a good
[31:54] word to use the word for knowledge is
[31:56] better predestination looks backs to
[31:58] foreknowledge and foreknowledge looks to
[32:01] destination
[32:02] now he's explaining what
[32:05] looking back and forth because that's
[32:06] the point of reading all of these things
[32:08] but god not making set it in order a
[32:11] little hole that you have to go through
[32:14] and can't go no other way
[32:20] in other words you think well i'm
[32:21] predestinated and i can't go no other
[32:23] way
[32:25] well let's answer the question to me
[32:28] when a man back there was told he was
[32:30] going to die
[32:32] he asked god and god gave him 15 years
[32:36] now you explain that when we'll talk
[32:41] well but that they don't need that
[32:43] because he order went ahead and died
[32:44] anyway because he he messed up i agree
[32:46] with you he messed up but that ain't the
[32:48] point the point is
[32:51] he asked for time and god changed his
[32:53] mind
[32:54] oh no god don't change his mind
[32:58] well
[32:59] what did he do he gave him 15 years he
[33:01] didn't change his mind no he died
[33:03] because he was told you're going to die
[33:05] there was no
[33:07] time limit in when he was going to die
[33:11] and he died
[33:14] but god gave him 15 years
[33:18] is this thing a stamp set thing
[33:21] you got exactly 82 years 421 days
[33:33] trying to get you away from a set period
[33:39] a point of looking at something that's
[33:42] well
[33:43] if it's meant for me to die then i'll
[33:45] die well there's a point to that that's
[33:47] true i meant to die you're gonna die
[33:49] that's true i don't need no revelation
[33:51] that's just plain sins
[33:56] but then how come it is that god will
[33:57] change his mind how come there was a
[34:00] little girl that
[34:02] brother random spoke of that
[34:04] she had this disease or something and
[34:06] she was sick and all in other words she
[34:08] died finally died
[34:11] and brother ron said he told her that
[34:13] she wasn't going to die told her
[34:14] something about it and
[34:16] she died he said god you owe me an
[34:19] answer
[34:20] he said he let me pout it out for about
[34:23] three months
[34:25] he said then he come and told me
[34:28] said she was supposed to die a year or
[34:30] so ago when she was in that river and
[34:32] drowned
[34:33] we said i gave her time
[34:35] to make a choice
[34:42] but see what's that now it's got to be
[34:45] to the second
[34:50] it ain't that away
[34:55] you can't go no other way
[35:00] well
[35:01] yep
[35:04] so i guess whatever will be will be
[35:08] no
[35:10] i don't have nothing to do with that
[35:13] okay now listen but god in order to be
[35:15] god amen he knowed the end from the
[35:18] beginning
[35:19] so he could predict it
[35:21] and set things in order to happen
[35:24] he knows it amen
[35:27] he knows it
[35:29] he knows what the end will be the second
[35:31] will be yes because he's god
[35:33] but he knew that before the world
[35:36] that's just for knowledge
[35:39] see his foreknowledge is greater and
[35:41] understanding than our predetermining
[35:47] okay
[35:48] number seven
[35:52] where i think pentecost failed
[35:54] but if we'd only go back to find out
[35:56] when god made his first man now he's
[35:58] going all the way back
[36:01] oh
[36:03] he's going all the way back
[36:05] see that's where we're gonna have to go
[36:07] across some history
[36:10] if we could go all the way back
[36:13] to that man we might find something
[36:16] when he made his first man he made man
[36:18] in his own image and god is a spirit so
[36:20] he had to make spirit man now the word
[36:23] is used there in the fifth verse of
[36:25] predestination
[36:26] predestinated is not a very good word
[36:29] for an evangelist or a minister to use
[36:32] why
[36:33] because it kind of confuses people when
[36:36] you say predestinate it confuses them
[36:38] that's why it's not a good word to you
[36:40] predestination speaks looks back to
[36:43] foreknowledge
[36:45] for knowledge looks to destination
[36:48] predestination goes back to full
[36:50] knowledge for knowledge goes to destiny
[36:53] in other words
[36:55] god didn't say now i'll make this man be
[36:57] this and i'll make this man be that but
[37:00] in order to be god he had to know the
[37:02] end from the beginning so in order to
[37:04] foreknowledge that he knew he could say
[37:08] this would happen and that would happen
[37:10] because it was god and knowed where
[37:12] everything would be
[37:14] placed
[37:15] and therefore
[37:17] he could ordain certain things
[37:19] for certain ages
[37:21] you believe in that don't you yeah go
[37:23] ahead to the next
[37:25] i'm just trying to get these cause i
[37:26] want you to understand it
[37:28] the message of faith of abraham and
[37:30] predestination is a hard word among a
[37:32] congregation of people because
[37:34] predestination
[37:36] really for knowledge is a better word
[37:38] and predestination looks back to
[37:40] foreknowledge and foreknowledge looks
[37:42] owned to destiny
[37:44] that god be an infinite in the beginning
[37:47] knew the end from the beginning
[37:48] therefore he knew what people would do
[37:52] so he could foretell what would take
[37:54] place for he knew what would be
[37:57] therefore before esaur or jacob either
[38:00] one was born god could say
[38:03] esau i've hated jacob of love
[38:06] because he foreknew what they could be
[38:10] he never made he saw the way he was
[38:14] he wasn't willing that esau would be
[38:16] that way but esau by choice
[38:19] god knew would take that way
[38:22] so that's how he knows us today
[38:25] he knows your heart
[38:27] and if you might be able to fool your
[38:29] neighbor
[38:30] you might be able to fool your pastor
[38:33] but you'll never be able to fool god
[38:35] because he knows your heart
[38:38] you'll never you can't do it go ahead to
[38:40] the next one
[38:43] communion church h
[38:46] all right let's see
[38:49] there's a couple here i want you yeah
[38:51] i want you to think on this one with me
[38:53] for a minute
[38:55] before i close this subject
[38:57] i know there is a question in your mind
[38:59] you will want to know if i believe in
[39:01] the doctrine of pre-existence
[39:06] i don't believe in that mormon doctrine
[39:08] of the pre-existence of souls
[39:11] any more than i believe in reincarnation
[39:13] or the transmigration
[39:16] of souls now listen
[39:18] i shouldn't say things but i try to be
[39:21] clear
[39:22] to all things
[39:24] now i've approached ministers on this
[39:27] when i would quote brother branham and
[39:29] say
[39:31] i don't believe in the doctrine of
[39:32] pre-existence
[39:34] when he believed in some form of
[39:35] pre-existence
[39:40] well
[39:44] what do you believe
[39:46] i don't believe in a pre-existence
[39:51] because if you're going to pre-existence
[39:53] you're going to predestination
[39:56] okay
[39:58] all right i said well ago
[40:00] in order to clear in your head
[40:03] what
[40:05] we don't believe in pre-existence
[40:12] okay
[40:13] you say well now
[40:14] i don't believe in that mormon doctrine
[40:16] but he believed in a pre-existence of
[40:18] souls
[40:20] he just didn't say that he didn't
[40:22] believe it
[40:24] what did he say
[40:28] i don't believe in that mormon doctrine
[40:30] of the pre-existence of soul
[40:32] any more
[40:34] than i believe in reincarnation amen
[40:41] because reincarnation is what
[40:44] you was something here and you moved
[40:45] over to here
[40:47] you existed before and then you come to
[40:49] this
[40:50] you reincarnated
[40:54] so he didn't believe in reincarnation
[40:57] or the transmigration of souls have you
[41:00] ever looked that up
[41:03] transmigration means to go from one body
[41:05] to another
[41:07] look it up in webster
[41:09] transmigration means to go from one body
[41:12] to another one he didn't believe in
[41:13] going from one body to another in other
[41:15] words me and me and brother johnny can't
[41:17] swap bodies
[41:22] you can't go from one body to another
[41:27] because that would mess you up
[41:30] be careful and see it's not the person
[41:32] that comes predestinated eternally from
[41:35] god it is the word or seed i believe in
[41:38] a predestinated eternal seed right i
[41:40] believe in it
[41:45] amen
[41:47] but the prophet told us when the seed
[41:48] was put there
[41:50] amen
[41:53] he said it was put there before the
[41:54] foundation of the world
[41:55] amen
[41:57] because that's his foreknowledge
[42:03] his foreknowledge was sitting back
[42:05] before the foundation world and saw the
[42:07] whole thing
[42:08] amen any problem
[42:12] what kind of a god do you believe in
[42:14] oh but i believe in this predestination
[42:17] all right
[42:19] what was before the world
[42:22] you as a person
[42:26] no
[42:29] it wasn't nothing you were only in his
[42:31] mind
[42:35] now mind is going back to foreknowledge
[42:38] yes
[42:44] in his mind
[42:49] in his foreknowledge
[42:54] he could see
[42:57] he knew if he made us we'd fall
[43:00] he knew that
[43:02] but that wasn't the downfall of the
[43:04] whole mankind
[43:07] but he knew that we'd fall
[43:12] now what kind of a goody goody are we
[43:15] to know that god made us knowing we'd
[43:17] fall
[43:19] well he didn't give me a choice
[43:21] that's the problem he gave you the
[43:23] choice
[43:26] he gave you the choice and the choice
[43:28] was you allowed yourself to fall
[43:31] you fell of your own free will not his
[43:35] he didn't want you to fall
[43:38] but he knew you would
[43:41] well he didn't give me a choice why
[43:43] didn't he give you a choice
[43:52] you're going to predetermine it before
[43:53] you ever start
[43:56] well don't worry about it that's right
[43:58] let's eat drink and be merry cause
[44:00] tomorrow we die
[44:03] well if i happen to be over on this side
[44:05] i'm okay but if i don't go on this side
[44:07] i've faced it ever since i've been in
[44:09] this message
[44:10] people are hollered about the
[44:12] the
[44:13] predestinated seeds and things
[44:15] and taking it back to
[44:20] making it that some people come into the
[44:22] world as an ability to be saved
[44:26] and others
[44:28] came with no ability to be saved
[44:32] i remember there a few weeks ago
[44:36] calvinism
[44:38] believes only a few people
[44:41] are to be saved
[44:45] armenianism
[44:46] leaves it for everybody
[44:48] but you've got to make your own choice
[44:54] so now where we're going
[44:56] well i don't i i'm glad i'm not one of
[44:59] the most serpent seed
[45:02] i've told you over and over i don't care
[45:05] if i could run my lineage all the way
[45:07] back and find out i was a direct dead
[45:09] descendant from cain that wouldn't
[45:12] bother me none whatsoever because that
[45:14] has nothing to do with my
[45:16] salvation has nothing to do with my soul
[45:21] amen
[45:22] if you don't give cain an opportunity to
[45:25] be saved you're making a full
[45:27] predetermining factor
[45:32] you're the one that's cutting him off
[45:33] don't cut him off
[45:35] god didn't cut him off right
[45:38] he told him right there in the word said
[45:39] if you'll do what your brother done
[45:42] you'll be all right
[45:49] that's why i wouldn't care i wouldn't
[45:50] care if you could run me all the way
[45:51] back and find out
[45:53] because see they can run these lineages
[45:55] back to find out who you come from
[45:59] well what are you worried about it
[46:04] well i want to know who i was
[46:08] you know i got enough trouble knowing
[46:09] who i am
[46:11] [Music]
[46:12] you might want to know who you was i got
[46:15] problems with who i am
[46:17] when i get through with this who i am i
[46:19] think i'll be out of here
[46:22] right okay come on
[46:25] that's the way way back too far back
[46:27] from the human mind of grass the eternal
[46:29] god with eternal thoughts thought and
[46:31] decreed jacob have i loved but he saw
[46:33] how i hated right
[46:37] but now remember one thing
[46:42] how could god hate
[46:45] esau
[46:52] he hated his ways
[46:56] he hated the person of what he was doing
[46:58] and what he was making his own choice he
[47:00] didn't there is no such word out of god
[47:02] to make a word hate
[47:06] you can't go to god and find the word
[47:08] hate where can you
[47:12] well he's got a right to hate
[47:15] no if he made you that way
[47:17] you can you can go right straight to him
[47:20] and he can't judge you
[47:21] if he made you wrong
[47:24] you can go before god and say you made
[47:26] me this away
[47:29] but he'll look back at you and say i
[47:31] didn't make you that way
[47:32] i gave you a choice and you took it
[47:35] now abide by your choice
[47:38] okay
[47:39] but now listen
[47:44] i'm gonna just bring a little thought
[47:47] we'll try to
[47:49] i just wanted to read those there's a
[47:50] whole bunch more but i just wanted to
[47:52] read the mind ones that's dealing with
[47:54] what he was saying where he says
[47:57] predestination
[48:01] doesn't come first for knowledge comes
[48:04] god predetermines by his foreknowledge
[48:08] so a destiny sure is set for every one
[48:10] of us everybody in the world
[48:13] is set with that right
[48:14] but you know what i love about the god
[48:16] that we serve
[48:19] you know he knows he he knows that
[48:22] person and just using the word of
[48:25] hot and talk back in some country there
[48:28] but you know what he's so good
[48:32] he doesn't stamp them as cut out
[48:39] they know nothing about him so they can
[48:41] just say in no way that they're saved
[48:48] but they can be given eternal life
[48:51] because of the fact of what they're good
[48:53] in their own
[48:54] tribes and doings in their own land
[48:57] what about a god of that way so let's
[48:59] don't play with him amen
[49:02] let's take it for what it is
[49:05] god knew you'd be sitting here today
[49:10] oh no i got up and just come here like
[49:12] one brother
[49:14] said that uh
[49:16] brother branham told him said well god
[49:18] had to drag you here
[49:22] he said well what do you mean he had to
[49:23] drink how did it what wasn't he he said
[49:25] well no difference where i come in the
[49:26] lifestyle where i come
[49:28] but see he didn't see what all went
[49:30] right was involved in that or how many
[49:32] wrecks was to kept from the man or what
[49:34] it is
[49:35] he was just seeing the fact that he
[49:38] he just went every day the same
[49:42] what do you think
[49:45] did god be for the world
[49:51] set a destiny
[49:55] for each and every one of us
[49:59] are
[50:03] that he by foreknowledge knew what the
[50:05] destiny of each one of us
[50:06] would be
[50:09] he knows what you're thinking what
[50:11] you're doing what our actions are what
[50:13] are reactions and why you're saying that
[50:19] if not then what kind of a god do you
[50:21] have
[50:25] you can't say god for you all things if
[50:27] you don't allow him to do it
[50:31] but listen
[50:34] get what i was saying there a moment ago
[50:38] for
[50:38] knowledge
[50:40] predestination
[50:42] is out here going that way
[50:44] for knowledge is back over here
[50:47] looking at what you're seeing
[50:51] okay
[50:53] for knowledge
[50:56] so then he could sit back before the
[50:57] world
[51:00] and know everything that we'd ever do
[51:02] or wouldn't do ever thought we'd ever
[51:03] have everything's going on
[51:06] amen
[51:07] so there's no need of trying to pull
[51:08] nothing over on him
[51:10] it's just a fact of saying god save my
[51:13] soul
[51:16] save me lord for myself mainly
[51:19] because that's my biggest enemy
[51:22] you're not my biggest enemy
[51:24] my biggest enemy is me
[51:28] i'm the one i have to deal with
[51:32] i see i deal with it like the same way i
[51:33] do here i look at it at the basis of
[51:36] what i'm saying
[51:37] god how did you do this
[51:41] he simply said i set back before the
[51:43] world
[51:45] and watched the world transpire
[51:49] i saw everything that would take place
[51:53] and i didn't have to make you do wrong
[51:56] had he made even adam wrong
[51:59] they could argue the point he didn't
[52:01] make them wrong he made them the way
[52:03] they are
[52:05] the the ability to fall was not a not
[52:08] a point of making them do
[52:11] but he knew what they'd do
[52:14] but you know what
[52:16] he also knew what you'd do
[52:26] he knew what you'd do
[52:27] yeah
[52:29] he knew whether you'd want to be saved
[52:31] or not
[52:33] he knows that now
[52:36] let's don't blame him
[52:39] for the choices
[52:42] yeah but but
[52:44] brother
[52:45] how could he choose me he never chose me
[52:48] wrong
[52:51] because you see that's not what you're
[52:52] dealing with
[52:53] here's what you're dealing with
[52:56] chosen us
[52:57] in
[52:58] him amen
[53:03] you say well how could we be chosen in
[53:05] him
[53:06] because the bible said
[53:09] that it was before the foundation of the
[53:11] world
[53:13] he stood as a lamb slain
[53:16] before the world ever begun
[53:21] if our name was ever written in heaven
[53:22] or any way it was written then
[53:27] won't be added down the road
[53:33] it was back there
[53:36] so which one do i want to go to destiny
[53:39] i want to know my destiny owner no i
[53:41] want to know my
[53:43] foreknowledge
[53:45] it may not sound good but you think
[53:47] about it
[53:49] the destiny that i've come to be one day
[53:52] out there i'll reach that destiny
[53:59] but you know what
[54:01] if i wasn't in his foreknowledge
[54:05] then my destiny
[54:07] won't do me no good
[54:11] right
[54:13] but my destiny i believe this message
[54:15] i'm i'm saved i know what i'm saying i
[54:17] know that
[54:18] i'm a christian i know i've been
[54:22] what are you arguing about
[54:28] well i'm looking forward but no i'm
[54:30] looking back
[54:33] that's an odd one i guess
[54:37] i'm looking back
[54:41] in his
[54:43] knowledge
[54:47] and he sees my choice
[54:53] like i said
[54:54] we want to make it and take our points
[54:56] but listen just one little point
[54:59] jacob have i loved he saw how i hated
[55:06] brother donnie brought it my attention
[55:07] because i know brother branham says that
[55:09] that uh jacob was a shyster
[55:12] you know the last quotes i gave on that
[55:14] last message he said esau was a shyster
[55:16] too so he calls both of them shysters
[55:19] you know that's that's all right
[55:24] jacob
[55:26] was a better man i mean was a
[55:28] a bad shyster
[55:30] he's always a better man
[55:34] you can't find anything that that esau
[55:37] was doing wrong
[55:38] except taking care of his daddy and
[55:40] doing all of the things
[55:41] looked like a good guy
[55:44] and god looks down and says
[55:48] jacob i love
[55:49] this all i hate
[55:53] like i've always said be careful how you
[55:55] place things
[55:59] the bible says david is a what
[56:03] he said a man after my own heart
[56:06] god is a murderer an adulteress
[56:09] uh oh
[56:14] be careful what you're saying
[56:20] when david was committing adultery and
[56:22] murder and all like out that didn't have
[56:24] anything to do with god
[56:31] jacob was the worst guy that could ever
[56:33] be
[56:35] because of all of the dirty tricks he
[56:37] pulled on everybody
[56:39] put it on esau then run from esau twice
[56:41] on and got everything he had got his
[56:43] birth right got everything
[56:45] and then he run and he was dealing with
[56:47] oh
[56:48] his future dad-in-law was there and he
[56:50] got the con artist doing with that
[56:55] sure he was scared to death he had a
[56:57] right to be scared when he was coming
[56:58] back he thought esau was going to kill
[57:00] him
[57:02] see we don't look at god in his way
[57:04] god came down into the heart of esau
[57:10] and esau looked out there and saw jacob
[57:12] coming
[57:14] he didn't grab his sword and start
[57:16] running for his throat
[57:20] he went to hug his brother's neck
[57:25] esau looks like a whole lot better guy
[57:28] in every form
[57:30] but yet what does the bible say
[57:34] jacob have i loved and he saw have i
[57:36] hated why did he hate him
[57:40] he hated his ways because his ways is
[57:42] what he was
[57:43] he gave away his birthright he gave away
[57:46] all of the things
[57:48] and look he saw
[57:50] then being that guy
[57:53] but god could still come down
[57:57] are you going to tell me esau is a
[57:58] serpent seed
[58:01] you may be careful the way you preach
[58:03] serpent seeds and things
[58:05] like i said the other day you're talking
[58:07] about
[58:08] uh hagar oh she ain't nothing ain't
[58:11] nothing
[58:12] god put her in the right place god told
[58:14] her to do this god told her to do that
[58:17] and made a nation out of it
[58:20] you don't listen you don't read your
[58:22] bible and think about it
[58:27] jacob wanted that birthright
[58:33] and he was willing to do everything he
[58:35] could to get it
[58:37] let me ask you a simple question and end
[58:40] it all
[58:41] how bad do you want the baptism of the
[58:43] holy ghost
[58:47] how bad do you want it
[58:50] well brother dale i want the baptism in
[58:52] the holy ghost so bad how bad do you
[58:54] want it
[59:00] because that's what jacob represented
[59:06] the baptism of the holy ghost
[59:09] might not be so much sad as we think to
[59:12] put you in a home push you through the
[59:13] other side
[59:14] you might find out one of these days and
[59:16] god kind of looks at things and it sways
[59:19] a little bit and
[59:21] don't misunderstand me
[59:23] but it's kind of sways a little bit in
[59:25] our life
[59:27] we're not all so goody-goody and walking
[59:29] so straight then we look down at the
[59:31] other one and say look at what they're
[59:33] doing
[59:37] better look at what you're doing
[59:40] we better keep ourselves involved
[59:44] don't worry about everybody else
[59:47] it's me and you lord it ain't me and all
[59:49] right come on just for one thought
[59:52] listen
[59:54] if it would be that you could choose
[1:00:00] which would you choose calvinism or
[1:00:02] armenianism
[1:00:10] i want to choose jesus christ
[1:00:14] because that way
[1:00:17] the bible said i was chosen
[1:00:20] in him
[1:00:21] amen
[1:00:22] not chosen off him chosen in him
[1:00:27] where was that at
[1:00:29] when he stood as a lamb slain before the
[1:00:31] foundation of the world
[1:00:34] i was chosen right there
[1:00:37] i want to go back to there
[1:00:39] and then whatever thing he's got for
[1:00:41] anymore that's all right
[1:00:44] but don't take your destiny and shove it
[1:00:46] over here put your destiny on out and
[1:00:48] let it just be what it is it's out
[1:00:50] you're under waiting on us
[1:00:52] come on musicians it's waiting on us
[1:00:56] we have a destiny but everybody has a
[1:00:58] destiny
[1:01:02] but if i accept jesus christ as my
[1:01:04] savior
[1:01:05] he paid the price
[1:01:08] but you see he's looking here i'm
[1:01:09] looking there
[1:01:11] i'm looking back before the foundation
[1:01:12] of the world to where
[1:01:14] that he died in my place
[1:01:20] he paid the price
[1:01:23] where are we at
[1:01:26] foreknowledge
[1:01:27] is a wonderful word
[1:01:30] those who he foreknew
[1:01:35] what does that mean brother dale before
[1:01:37] the foundation of the world
[1:01:39] in his foreknowledge he foreknew
[1:01:43] exactly what we would do
[1:01:47] so let's stay with the foreknowledge
[1:01:49] and remember now when i come out with
[1:01:51] the next message and start talking about
[1:01:53] christ is a mystery of god revealed and
[1:01:55] god had a plan and purpose
[1:01:58] don't lose what i'm talking about
[1:02:02] stay with the point that he believes in
[1:02:05] foreknowledge
[1:02:08] and that god sets everything according
[1:02:10] to that foreknowledge
[1:02:14] well no he picked his people he picked
[1:02:16] this group of people he picks that group
[1:02:18] of people i can find your quotes
[1:02:23] but just remember
[1:02:30] go back to foreknowledge
[1:02:32] let's stand together that's right
[1:02:35] all we got brother
[1:02:40] [Music]
[1:02:54] [Music]
[1:03:13] all
[1:03:18] [Music]
[1:03:28] know
[1:03:30] [Music]
[1:03:31] abraham will teach his children
[1:03:33] [Music]
[1:03:41] jacob jesus wanted
[1:03:44] [Music]
[1:03:47] what about you jesus
[1:03:50] [Music]
[1:04:03] [Applause]
[1:04:06] oh jesus see god is
[1:04:11] [Music]
[1:04:21] see salvation is for everybody right but
[1:04:24] everybody's not going to receive it we
[1:04:27] know that
[1:04:28] but that won't be god's fault
[1:04:32] that'll be our fault
[1:04:37] we trigger our own predestination i
[1:04:39] guess the way brother tom used to say it
[1:04:41] [Music]
[1:04:44] see i believe you do have something to
[1:04:45] do with it
[1:04:50] see i believe
[1:04:53] that some people
[1:04:56] live a good clean life
[1:05:00] maybe not even a christian
[1:05:02] [Music]
[1:05:04] you know good people
[1:05:08] i do
[1:05:09] you have neighbors you have people
[1:05:11] around you or something that
[1:05:12] they live a good life
[1:05:14] and that's not gonna put them into
[1:05:16] heaven
[1:05:17] but how about coupling that with the
[1:05:19] fact of jesus christ coming to pay the
[1:05:21] price
[1:05:24] brother dale i you can't be good enough
[1:05:26] to get saved no
[1:05:31] let my salvation
[1:05:33] mold me into what he wants me to be
[1:05:40] right
[1:05:41] then he can set my destiny
[1:05:43] [Music]
[1:05:47] but you see you're going to find out
[1:05:48] that what it is
[1:05:50] we get back to it
[1:05:52] it's in this age
[1:05:54] that he predetermines a group of people
[1:05:56] to come to the stature of a perfect man
[1:05:58] [Music]
[1:06:00] if this age is the only age it was
[1:06:02] promised to totally come to there
[1:06:04] see they're going to come to that
[1:06:05] because they're going to come to the
[1:06:06] knowledge of his word and they're going
[1:06:08] to know right where he stands and where
[1:06:10] they stand
[1:06:13] and determine it
[1:06:17] because he predestinates
[1:06:20] a people
[1:06:23] because he knew
[1:06:25] he looked down through and seen what you
[1:06:27] and i would be doing in this day
[1:06:35] by doing that then he can predetermine
[1:06:37] [Music]
[1:06:40] but you were chosen for this age because
[1:06:42] of what you are
[1:06:45] well there's anything good about me no
[1:06:47] now don't get none of that junk involved
[1:06:49] there's nothing good in any of us
[1:06:52] but he did look down and see some
[1:06:53] desires
[1:06:56] god predestinates according to your
[1:06:58] desire
[1:07:00] [Music]
[1:07:01] you desire to be a christian he's got it
[1:07:03] ready
[1:07:05] if you desire to be a sinner he lets you
[1:07:07] go
[1:07:10] for knowledge
