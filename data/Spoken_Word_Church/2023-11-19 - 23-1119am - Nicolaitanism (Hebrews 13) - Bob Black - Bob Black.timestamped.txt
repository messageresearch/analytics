[0:04] God bless you Saints good to be in the

[0:07] Lord I hope you come expecting today I
[0:11] did and
[0:13] uh as we're we're continuing on our
[0:16] little study of Hebrews 137 and 8
[0:20] remember them which have the rule over
[0:21] you um just get my slide shared here and
[0:25] I I sure appreciate all all the prayers
[0:27] this week um you know I just had had a
[0:30] little surgery this this week to get
[0:32] some things fixed up so thank the Lord
[0:34] all is well and I appreciate all all the
[0:36] phone calls and texts and everything um
[0:38] it's it's good to know you're loved so
[0:41] appreciate you very
[0:43] much Lord Jesus we just thank you Lord
[0:45] God for the ability to come and gather
[0:47] around your word this morning Lord and
[0:48] we just pray Lord as we invite you into
[0:50] the house Lord that you'll be with us
[0:52] today give us Liberty and understanding
[0:54] Lord Jesus Lord that you'll help us Lord
[0:57] Jesus to receive to have the right
[0:59] spirit in the right right attitude to
[1:00] receive what you have in store for us
[1:01] today Lord I pray Lord that you'll be
[1:03] with us this morning as we just study
[1:04] through these scriptures be with brother
[1:06] Tim as he's preparing his heart Lord to
[1:08] to deliver his message to us today Lord
[1:11] and we just ask Lord that you'll be with
[1:13] us and bless your word Lord in the name
[1:15] of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:17] amen so verse 7 says remember them which
[1:21] have the rule over you who have spoken
[1:23] unto you the word of God whose Faith
[1:26] follow considering the end of their
[1:27] conversation Jesus Christ same yesterday
[1:30] and today and forever and I I really
[1:33] just kind of wanted to meditate more on
[1:35] um you know we there God has given us
[1:38] good leadership um but then uh on the
[1:41] other the flip side of that you begin to
[1:44] study the seals and so forth and look at
[1:45] the history of the church down through
[1:47] the seven Church ages and there's that
[1:49] that nickan spirit that rose up that had
[1:52] tried to take a different kind of rule
[1:55] so it's I it's I think it's just kind of
[1:57] helpful to study that out and see that
[1:59] God wants us to have liberty liberty and
[2:02] worship Liberty and understanding and
[2:04] that's really what that nickan Spirit
[2:06] was would would that Antichrist spirit
[2:09] that began down in the very first church
[2:11] age tried to take away from the people
[2:13] and of course you study that out and you
[2:14] can see that it it it runs all the way
[2:16] over today where you can see that same
[2:18] Spirit tries to influence things there's
[2:20] spirits that you know move in the church
[2:22] and try to influence I mean even you
[2:24] look at how Jezebel that Jezebel spirit
[2:26] if you follow it all through all the way
[2:28] through the Jezebel spirit would try to
[2:29] control
[2:30] control the way that Elijah uh Elijah
[2:34] brought his message and controlled Ahab
[2:36] and it's all about control many times so
[2:39] you look at um let's look at this first
[2:41] little slide that we were reading uh
[2:43] last time where brother Ram said it is
[2:45] the word that rules us not men now there
[2:49] that really puts into perspective what
[2:51] Paul was trying to say when he said
[2:52] remember them which have the rule over
[2:54] you there there's leaders that God puts
[2:56] in the church to to uh convey the word
[2:59] to preach the word and then that word
[3:01] grabs a hold of your life and begins to
[3:03] shape the way that you think and the way
[3:05] that you do and you the word you know
[3:07] the word grabs a hold of you and you
[3:09] start dressing differently you start
[3:11] believing different and before you know
[3:12] it you're going down to be baptized
[3:14] different way maybe than that way that
[3:16] denomination taught you why because the
[3:18] word began to rule over you not a man
[3:21] but a word and brother R will say now a
[3:23] man as a husband is head of the woman he
[3:25] rules her but the church is a woman too
[3:27] and her ruler is the word Jesus Jesus is
[3:30] the word if she rejects the word and
[3:32] takes any other
[3:34] headship she is an
[3:36] adulteress and in the Ephesian Church
[3:39] age I I I've got a lot of quotes to read
[3:40] so we're just going to kind of go
[3:42] through some of these quotes this
[3:43] morning and just um just meditate on the
[3:45] things that brother R said about that n
[3:47] nickan Spirit he said what the church
[3:49] had at Pentecost is her inalienable
[3:52] right originally she had the pure word
[3:55] of God she had the power of the spirit
[3:58] manifested in D divers signs and wonders
[4:00] and Gifts of the Holy Ghost and then he
[4:03] keeps going on he said that original
[4:05] church was not organized by men it was
[4:08] led by the Holy Ghost it wasn't very big
[4:12] it was hated and despised it was
[4:15] oppressed it was persecuted unto death
[4:18] but it was true to God it stayed with
[4:21] the original word pattern now see there
[4:25] you there you can see that to be led by
[4:27] the Holy Ghost it it the words got to
[4:30] come first because what is what is the
[4:32] word the word is like a a the the
[4:34] purpose of the word is to loose the holy
[4:36] ghost in your life the true
[4:39] interpretation of the word when it's
[4:40] preached it causes it causes a channel
[4:43] to be opened up to you so that the Holy
[4:44] Ghost can be able to work so now in the
[4:47] early church if if men's ideas were
[4:49] preached then that kind of binds things
[4:51] up where the Holy Ghost can't have
[4:52] Liberty but if the true interpretation
[4:54] of the word is preached the true
[4:56] Revelation oh you see like for example
[4:58] somebody come to church church and the
[5:00] devil's been telling all these lies
[5:01] about how you can't be saved or
[5:02] something and the preacher starts
[5:03] preaching the true interpretation that
[5:06] it's possible that that's for you and
[5:08] then something begins to open up a
[5:10] channel begins to open up where they
[5:11] begin to believe and something begins to
[5:13] happen and and there you've got the true
[5:15] Liberty of the Holy go the true Liberty
[5:17] of worship something strikes in a
[5:18] believer's heart and they see something
[5:21] that God wanted them to see and they
[5:22] just begin to something happens they
[5:25] begin to Rejoice maybe or or maybe they
[5:27] don't begin to Rejoice cuz you get
[5:28] Liberty is what're talking about maybe
[5:30] they just sit there in the quiet and
[5:32] something begins to stir in their heart
[5:34] and they go home and they want
[5:35] something's something's awakened within
[5:37] them they they they want a closer walk
[5:39] with God so you see we're talking about
[5:41] Liberty and that's what that nielan
[5:43] Spirit would try to take away where the
[5:44] Holy Ghost can have Liberty in a church
[5:46] or in your people's life or in your life
[5:49] that's what we want just like in the
[5:51] very the very first uh Church age for
[5:54] the Holy Ghost to have Liberty I got
[5:55] these two contrasting views on the one
[5:57] hand you got the Holy Ghost having free
[5:59] reign in the church to be able to do as
[6:02] he wants to do now that's really what we
[6:05] want we want the Holy Ghost to be able
[6:07] to do what he wants to do at the end of
[6:09] the service if every maybe everybody's
[6:11] ready to go get something to eat but the
[6:12] Holy Ghost wants to do something so we
[6:14] we'll linger we we'll let the Holy Ghost
[6:16] do what he wants to do in somebody's
[6:18] life and and how is he going to do it
[6:20] when the true gospel is preached to open
[6:23] up some about that channel then the Holy
[6:24] Ghost can do what he wants to do now on
[6:26] the other side we've got this picture of
[6:28] the stained glass wind everybody's all
[6:30] dressed in their finery with their
[6:31] little flowers on their tuxed and things
[6:34] and it looks real religious but the Holy
[6:36] Ghost can't do what the Holy Ghost wants
[6:37] to do he can't move why because they
[6:40] they they've cabbaged down on on that
[6:42] that nickan idea where they've got a
[6:45] bunch of men telling you what their
[6:46] thoughts are and their their ideas about
[6:49] how things should be run and it just
[6:51] restricts the holy ghost from being able
[6:52] to do something you know they're being
[6:55] baptized in the name of uh three
[6:57] different people and don't don't have
[6:59] true understanding of the godhead don't
[7:00] have a true understanding of all these
[7:02] all these core doctrines that we believe
[7:04] and it just prevents the holy ghost from
[7:06] being able to be loosed in the people's
[7:08] lives so what what's nanism in the
[7:11] message Investments brother R said I
[7:13] read in the Bible that God told John on
[7:15] the aisle of patmas that the Deeds of
[7:18] the nicians he hated nio conquer lady to
[7:22] conquer the lady and put all the
[7:24] Holiness in some certain men now look
[7:28] how look how he kind of breaks down
[7:30] nanism n what the way it should work is
[7:33] Holiness is to all everybody should be
[7:38] able to experience a moving of the Holy
[7:40] Ghost in their life not just a select
[7:42] group of people not like a priest or a
[7:43] post up in up in the front you know we
[7:46] just grabbing it all to themselves and
[7:47] say and you got to listen to me he said
[7:50] the Holy Spirit fell upon the whole
[7:52] group there's no holy man anyhow it's a
[7:54] holy God we don't say holy church holy
[7:57] people is holy God we're not holy but he
[8:01] is Holy not a holy minister is the holy
[8:04] spirit he ministers through the minister
[8:06] is not holy men we none of us holy but
[8:10] they seemingly too many times are
[8:12] turning down the same
[8:15] opportunity I I love this quote from why
[8:18] Christ Peak now before I read this let
[8:20] me just set the stage where brother
[8:21] Brown's tell talking about Moses going
[8:24] down to deliver the children of Israel
[8:25] out of Egypt and Pharaoh says well I
[8:28] I'll tell you as long as the elders you
[8:31] the elders can go like the ministers the
[8:33] Bishops the the pope what you know the
[8:35] leaders well you can go out and worship
[8:38] but whatever you do don't let the people
[8:42] get it now there's that nickan Spirit
[8:45] rising up whatever you do don't let the
[8:48] people get a real baptism of the Holy
[8:51] Ghost don't let the people get don't let
[8:53] the Holy Ghost get to working in the
[8:54] people and cuz we don't the devil does
[8:56] not want the people sitting out there in
[8:58] the congregation to get a revelation of
[9:01] who they are and and what this Bible is
[9:03] telling them about so brother R said
[9:06] let's read it he said but you know the
[9:07] faith that Moses had didn't believe in a
[9:10] soar religion he said we're all going
[9:14] we're going all the way that's right
[9:16] we're going to the promised land we just
[9:19] don't go out here make it a domination
[9:20] and stop we go on through amen I'm going
[9:24] on to the promised land God promised us
[9:27] how many pharaohs have we got today
[9:29] standing in the Pulpit heads of
[9:32] organizations now if you just do that ju
[9:35] just do this and do that that's all well
[9:37] see just so far but Moses said oh no no
[9:42] no no no see Pharaoh said well why not
[9:46] if you're going to have that kind of
[9:48] religion I'll tell you what you do just
[9:51] you and the elders go worship see just
[9:55] you and the elders go worship cause you
[9:57] all can have that kind of of religion
[10:00] but don't get it among the
[10:03] people now you you really meditate on
[10:06] that maybe maybe sitting at home late
[10:08] tonight God wants you to catch the
[10:11] Revelation this is not something for
[10:13] just a person behind the pulpit to to
[10:15] have an understanding of the seals and
[10:16] the Deep things but God wants everybody
[10:19] that's why he said we're all going Mo
[10:22] that's what Moses commission was we're
[10:23] all going nobody left behind
[10:28] right
[10:30] and that other story in from 1 Samuel
[10:33] where all the is Elders of Israel
[10:35] gathered themselves together and they
[10:37] told they told Samuel give us a king
[10:39] give us a man to lead us leader it they
[10:42] had God leading them but instead they
[10:44] wanted they wanted a man to lead over
[10:47] them all the elders elders of Israel
[10:50] gathered themselves together and said
[10:51] unto him behold Thou Art old and thy
[10:53] Sons walk not in thy ways now make us a
[10:56] king to judge us like all the nations
[10:59] but the thing displeased Samuel when
[11:01] they said give us a king to judge
[11:03] us and back to the Ephesian Church age
[11:05] brother R said see what was happening
[11:07] back there that false Vine was getting a
[11:10] hold and it was teaching that rulership
[11:13] by man was right it taught that the
[11:16] church had to be governed it taught a
[11:19] control over the people but instead of
[11:22] doing a God's way they simply took
[11:25] Authority and vested all the spiritual
[11:27] power and their own hands and came out
[11:30] with a holy priesthood standing between
[11:34] God and the people they went right back
[11:36] to the old ironic system they became
[11:40] Antichrist for they disposed of his
[11:42] mediatorship and imposed their own God
[11:45] hated that the Ephesians hated that and
[11:48] any True Believer will hate it too now
[11:51] you see why God would hate it he wants
[11:53] to do something in your life and that
[11:55] nickolath and idea will prevent that an
[11:59] epes another quote from the Ephesian
[12:00] Church age he said we would have to be
[12:02] Stone blind not to see that same thing
[12:05] at work All Through the Ages and right
[12:07] now it is the worst of all what it was
[12:11] was
[12:11] organization that separated the people
[12:14] God's people are supposed to be one by
[12:18] one Spirit are they all baptized into
[12:21] one body and everyone is to be moved
[12:24] upon by the Holy Ghost and everyone is
[12:28] to participate and the worship of God
[12:31] now you see how whenever he's breaking
[12:33] down nanism is he's talking about
[12:35] Liberty and worship and the holy ghost
[12:38] moving in your life cuz that's what that
[12:41] nickan attitude wants to prevent but men
[12:45] wanted the preeminence so they took over
[12:47] control and Bishops became
[12:50] archbishops and with imposing titles
[12:53] they bypassed the word of God and taught
[12:55] their own doctrines they got the people
[12:58] to obey them until the time came that
[13:00] their way of worship did not in any way
[13:03] at all resemble the early days after
[13:05] Pentecost these Deeds were the beginning
[13:08] of apostolic
[13:10] succession you see you really break what
[13:12] what's Apostolic succession that that I
[13:15] can't preach unless I had been ordained
[13:18] or put you you know kind of put put in
[13:21] this position by someone who you could
[13:23] trace all the way back to the very fir
[13:26] early first CH early church and in
[13:29] instead of just having the liberty of
[13:31] God to be able to say to to to call
[13:34] somebody you know like like a little
[13:36] David or whatever to call somebody to
[13:38] preach so Apostolic succession is
[13:40] limiting the moving of the Holy Ghost to
[13:43] just call somebody call somebody and put
[13:45] them put it in a place where they can
[13:47] preach we're talking about Liberty the
[13:49] liberty of the Holy Ghost from the whole
[13:52] Apostolic succession it was one easy and
[13:54] quick step to church membership as the
[13:56] means of Saving Grace the word was
[13:57] reduced to a Creed
[13:59] Antichrist by his Spirit was
[14:01] predominating the
[14:03] church and this m and church age brother
[14:05] R said now on the second chapter in the
[14:07] e8th verse We Begin tonight now what did
[14:08] we leave him on last night he was
[14:10] certainly hated that
[14:12] nickan now what does God do what we have
[14:14] to have found out first the revelation
[14:16] of Jesus Christ who he is and what he is
[14:19] now the next great thing we find out
[14:21] that he hates
[14:22] anything that'll put anything to rule
[14:26] over his church beside besides himself
[14:30] he is a jealous God how I'd like to stop
[14:33] cuz we got four verses here just to
[14:35] quote a little something how many can
[14:36] remember when the good prophet Samuel
[14:39] when all of Israel wanted to act like
[14:41] the rest of the world do you remember
[14:43] that and the prophet told them said
[14:45] you're wrong but they wanted to act like
[14:47] the Philistines and like the rest of
[14:49] them well that's exactly what happened
[14:52] in this very first church age it's
[14:54] strange that people don't want God to
[14:57] lead them they want to follow they want
[15:01] some
[15:02] man now you think about that that God
[15:05] wants you to have a personal
[15:06] relationship with him where you you got
[15:09] that promise the spirit of truth will
[15:11] lead and guide you into all truth that
[15:13] God wants to grab a hold of your life
[15:16] and do the
[15:17] leading and questions and answers he
[15:19] said you know we sometimes think cuz
[15:21] we're preachers not you and I don't say
[15:23] brother but preachers think because
[15:26] they're preachers that there's somebody
[15:27] bigger than one of the L members of the
[15:29] church you're no bigger and you're no
[15:32] more in the sight of God than that
[15:34] drunkard that was converted an hour ago
[15:38] now that puts things into perspective
[15:39] doesn't it so what I got all these
[15:42] little quotes that I compiled on this
[15:43] slide that just pulled from different
[15:45] places in the message and let's just
[15:46] read through them nickan means to
[15:49] conquer the lady to take to take away
[15:52] that movement of the Holy Spirit on the
[15:53] lady and just put it on put it on the
[15:55] like the church leadership like they did
[15:58] that eventually turned into Roman
[15:59] Catholicism denomination it's
[16:01] organization where instead of following
[16:03] the leading of the Holy Ghost you're
[16:04] following what some group of people say
[16:08] it is terrible and now brother said now
[16:10] why is this such a terrible thing it is
[16:12] terrible because God has never placed
[16:14] his church in the hands of an elected
[16:17] leadership which moves with political
[16:19] mindedness he has placed his church in
[16:21] the care of God ordained spirit filled
[16:24] world living men who lead the people
[16:27] through feeding them the word now that
[16:29] goes back to what Paul's saying that
[16:31] we're LED we're led by the word he has
[16:35] not separated the people into the
[16:36] classes so that the masses are led by a
[16:38] holy priesthood it is true that the
[16:40] leadership must be holy but then so must
[16:43] the be the whole
[16:45] congregation further there is no place
[16:47] in the word where priests or ministers
[16:49] or such mediate between God and the
[16:51] people nor is there a place where they
[16:53] are separated in their worship of the
[16:55] Lord God wants all to love and serve him
[16:58] together nickan ISM destroys those
[17:02] precepts and instead separates the
[17:05] ministers from the people and makes the
[17:07] leaders
[17:08] overlords instead of servants that's why
[17:13] Peter said in 1 Peter chapter 5 feed the
[17:15] flock of God feed by the word neither is
[17:18] being Lords of God's Heritage but being
[17:21] examples to the flock and I got a little
[17:24] footnote down there that Lords mean is
[17:25] is it's the Greek word translated as
[17:28] Lord words means overbearing or
[17:30] controlling because the L the word the
[17:33] Holy Ghost is the one that we want to
[17:35] have control now brother Brown said in
[17:37] pergan church age he said now this
[17:39] nickan Doctrine this rule that was
[17:42] established in the church did not hit it
[17:44] off too well with a lot of the people
[17:46] for they could read the odd epistle or
[17:48] essay on the word written by some Godly
[17:50] person so what did the church
[17:52] do it excommunicated the righteous
[17:55] teachers and burned the Scrolls they
[17:58] said said it takes a special education
[18:00] to read and understand the word why even
[18:02] Peter said that many things Paul wrote
[18:04] were hard to understand having taken
[18:06] away the word from the people it soon
[18:08] came to the people listening only to
[18:10] what the priest had to say and doing
[18:12] what he told them they call that God and
[18:15] His holy word they took over their minds
[18:18] the minds and lives of the people and
[18:21] made them the Servants of a despotic
[18:25] priesthood what's l l n leonism
[18:29] following a man's ideas rather than
[18:31] Christ like like you can pay for your
[18:33] loved one to get out of purgatory that's
[18:35] not in the Bible anywhere that's just
[18:36] some man's idea but it's it's a great
[18:39] way to make some
[18:41] money a substitute for a personal
[18:44] relationship with God and the leading of
[18:46] the Holy Ghost you're substitute the
[18:47] leading of a man for the leading of the
[18:49] Holy Spirit when you you it's you're
[18:51] basically swapping it out nanism is that
[18:54] formal dead religion it's trying to take
[18:57] the church with where God had pastors
[19:00] and the spirit of God moving by gifts in
[19:02] the Church of the Living God and they
[19:04] were having a Doctrine start that they
[19:06] were going to have some priests and
[19:09] Bishops and popes and he said all right
[19:12] overthrow or conquer or take place of
[19:14] the Ley in other words take all the
[19:16] sacredness all the power from the church
[19:20] and put it over on the priests let the
[19:23] congregation live the way it wants to
[19:25] but the priest is the Holy One taking
[19:29] the Holy Ghost away from the people and
[19:31] that goes back to that story in why
[19:33] Christ PE whatever you do don't let the
[19:36] people have a real experience with God
[19:38] don't let the people catch a revelation
[19:42] taking the Holy Ghost away from the
[19:43] people with signs and wonders following
[19:45] them and take that away and give them a
[19:47] holy priesthood taking away the Holy
[19:49] Ghost and swapping it for a priesthood
[19:52] brother random said in another
[19:54] place he said the nickolath and bringing
[19:56] in a bunch of men to twist up the
[19:58] scripture and make a denomination that
[20:01] can't let God move in
[20:04] it and another place he said not one
[20:06] time can I ever glean one thing of all
[20:09] the Bishops of the nician church that
[20:11] formed the hierarchy of Rome the pope
[20:13] not one time in history have we a record
[20:15] of any of those Bishops ever raising the
[20:19] dead or anything like that because
[20:22] Christ the resurrection wasn't in their
[20:26] hearts oh you see where that nian Spirit
[20:29] it it's against the Holy Ghost being
[20:32] able to do what the Holy Ghost wants to
[20:35] do
[20:37] Liberty and worship and Truth another
[20:41] place he said now the word pergamus
[20:42] means marry the very word pergamus means
[20:44] uh married Christianity that is the
[20:46] nielan side the formal side married to
[20:48] the state Pagan ceremonies and it was
[20:51] the birth of the Catholic church in that
[20:53] day now anyone knows that the Catholic
[20:56] church was brought into existence at the
[20:57] Nic seeing counsel before there it was
[21:00] called a nickan by God which means to
[21:03] conquer overthrow overcome or overthrow
[21:05] the lady and when they did
[21:07] that they didn't want the spirit amongst
[21:11] the
[21:12] people that's that nickan Spirit didn't
[21:15] want the spirit amongst the
[21:18] people brother Ram said and be not
[21:20] afraid it is I he said I am not one of
[21:22] the Believers and the nicat and taking
[21:24] all conquer the Le and put it all on the
[21:26] pasture it's in the lady the Holy Spirit
[21:29] just doesn't baptize the pastor it
[21:32] baptizes the lady too it's all in the L
[21:35] and Pastor is just one of us means the
[21:37] shepherd Pastor which means the feeder
[21:39] of the flock the holy spirit gives
[21:42] overseer to watch it and control it he's
[21:46] not saying we don't need a pastor he's
[21:48] saying he wants the same Holy Ghost
[21:50] that's up here behind the pulpit go
[21:52] moving through the whole congregation in
[21:54] the lives of each and every individualz
[21:57] that's what that's what God wants and
[21:59] that's what that nickan Spirit tries to
[22:01] prevent he said in the peran church age
[22:04] can't you see the nicians the hybrids
[22:06] see it don't you see the true spiritual
[22:09] what was the difference of them one had
[22:12] signs
[22:13] following the other one had the form the
[22:17] other one had signs
[22:20] following think about that that's what
[22:23] God wants to happen he wants to be able
[22:25] to do something in your life he wants
[22:27] good things to happen in your life when
[22:30] you need healing when you need a touch
[22:31] from God when you need something happen
[22:33] at your workplace just trust in God and
[22:35] let that Holy Ghost go to work he said
[22:38] that's the same thing that taking place
[22:39] here the Ning Council nickan formal
[22:42] Christianity and the Holy Spirit comes
[22:44] back and said you've got the doctrine of
[22:46] balum among you see I hate them
[22:48] doctrines them these of the nicians them
[22:51] doctrines that they got because it's the
[22:52] doctrine of balam who taught the
[22:54] children of Israel to
[22:56] stumble
[22:58] and we'll I'll just read this last slide
[23:00] and then we'll close the this we'll end
[23:03] the
[23:04] lesson he said you hybrid with the world
[23:07] with the nickan idea not let the Holy
[23:11] Ghost have its way that's the Nic it's
[23:14] an idea to not let the Holy Ghost have
[23:17] its way the word niik the Greek word
[23:20] niik means to overcome or conquer
[23:22] overcome what the leoty the Holy Spirit
[23:24] take out of the church the resurrected
[23:27] Lord Jesus
[23:28] with signs and wonders among the
[23:30] Believers and put men voted in to be a
[23:33] pope or a cardinal or an overseer trying
[23:36] to take the place to take the Holy Ghost
[23:38] away from the lady and give it to an
[23:40] order called The Holy order of men you
[23:43] say why can't the priest be a Shepherd
[23:45] what kind of a food is he feeding you do
[23:47] you get the same results they had the
[23:51] day of Pentecost and he said now you
[23:53] just can't have a nician setup in the
[23:55] church and not have this other Doctrine
[23:57] bism come into to you you see if you
[23:59] take away the word of God and the moving
[24:03] of the spirit as a means of worship then
[24:06] you will have to give the people another
[24:08] form of worship as a substitute and
[24:12] substitution spells
[24:15] bism so what what's God want to do he
[24:17] wants to have his way with you let's let
[24:20] him have his way with us today during
[24:23] this service just if you haven't yet
[24:25] give him give him your heart give him
[24:27] everything you are so that the Holy
[24:29] Ghost can have its way amen and do what
[24:32] he wants to do with you God bless you
[24:35] [Applause]
[24:44] Saints
