[6:27] refreshing time we had a good week good
[6:30] time this weekend with Brother Willie
[6:32] and he said he called back and said or
[6:35] sent a text back and said thank you very
[6:37] much
[6:38] for the invite and the good spirits uh
[6:42] he had a little snafu Sunday they
[6:45] canceled this flight I had not
[6:47] I had not known of Delta canceling a
[6:49] flight now Spirit Air
[6:52] that's not the Holy Spirit that's for
[6:54] sure
[6:55] it'll test your spirit
[6:57] but usually you know usually Delta
[7:00] doesn't cancel flights so while I was
[7:02] telling y'all we were leaving Sunday to
[7:04] go to the airport he was sitting in
[7:06] there shaking his head and I thought
[7:08] well you stay in another day but they
[7:09] had canceled this flight on the phone so
[7:12] so we uh took him down to the airport
[7:14] and put him up in a motel there and he
[7:16] got home just fine to West Palm Beach
[7:19] but he said he had a really good time I
[7:21] really enjoyed being with him I hadn't
[7:23] seen him like I said in a long time so
[7:25] but he sends his greetings he made it
[7:27] home safe
[7:28] my way of announcements uh this coming
[7:32] Sunday the 7th
[7:35] we're going to have one service in the
[7:37] morning regular
[7:38] then the second service will have a
[7:41] vowel renewal service
[7:43] a baby dedication or a dedication of
[7:46] yourself if you want to do that
[7:48] and then we'll have a baptismal service
[7:50] the pool is ready I just cleaned I
[7:53] drained it cleaned it and it's filling
[7:54] up now so it will be ready to go and
[7:57] I'll turn the heater on and it'll be
[7:58] good and warm
[8:00] for Sunday so if anybody wants to be
[8:02] baptized
[8:03] that will be the last thing we do and
[8:05] also remember we will take communion
[8:07] Sunday morning after the first service
[8:10] that way we'll we'll still be able to uh
[8:13] man we'll get every ordinance we got in
[8:15] in the uh in that one day so I
[8:19] appreciate that I thank the Lord for for
[8:21] giving us an opportunity to do every one
[8:23] of them
[8:24] it's just an honor people get honored to
[8:27] do other things I you know it's an honor
[8:29] to baptize somebody to dedicate the baby
[8:31] to to do a wedding we'll be doing uh
[8:34] Lauren fleeman's wedding Saturday so
[8:37] just keep us in prayer there but we'll

[8:46] have prayer service that will be the
[8:47] 13th
[8:49] and then from six to eight we'll have
[8:51] Bible study and that'll be a
[8:53] continuation of the Bible study we had I
[8:56] still have a sheet of questions that we
[8:59] need to answer

[9:02] study this month but we're going to have
[9:04] it that Saturday we sure would
[9:06] appreciate if you come if not then it'll
[9:09] be on
[9:10] um cassette also tonight I don't think
[9:13] we're online uh
[9:16] at the moment so just let's just pray
[9:18] that that thing gets back up I hate we
[9:21] have to
[9:22] deal with the internet but we have to
[9:25] deal with internet
[9:26] so let's just pray that it's not in the
[9:28] building it's somewhere out there so
[9:30] let's just pray that that thing will get
[9:32] back up because there are several people
[9:33] that are streaming that stream every
[9:35] service and we sure want them to uh
[9:38] fulfill a part of us and not be left out
[9:40] not be in the dark
[9:42] so let's just pray that that thing will
[9:44] get back up and then all on that will be
[9:47] the 13th
[9:49] then we'll have normal service on the
[9:51] 14th which will be Mother's Day
[9:54] um and then the next
[9:56] Saturday at three o'clock we'll have a
[9:58] youth service brother William borlavon

[10:05] coming from Macon and I know that uh
[10:09] Brother Sam and and their families
[10:11] coming sister Monica's uh brother so I
[10:15] talked to Brother Martin I'm going to
[10:17] minister for him the end of the month
[10:18] and he said he would tell his people and
[10:21] they will try to come also so let's just
[10:24] keep that in prayer we will have a a
[10:26] good service and then we'll only have
[10:27] one service the next that Sunday May the
[10:30] 21st and brother William will be with us
[10:32] then and like I said the next Sunday
[10:35] um I'll be at brother Martins picking

[10:41] brother Bob and and um and brother Joe
[10:44] back it was good to see him they were
[10:46] they were missed
[10:48] and we got them back now so everything's
[10:50] everything's okay we're all right
[10:53] so all mines clear everything else good
[10:55] I don't know next Wednesday I think it's
[10:58] Aaron's turn to preach so maybe it'll I
[10:59] think it's your turn so you'll be
[11:01] preaching next Wednesday so
[11:05] let's go to the Lord and prayer remember
[11:06] me I
[11:08] uh my PSA level still going up instead
[11:11] of about 11 now so
[11:12] but they're not scared about anything we
[11:15] just had a biopsy a year ago and it's
[11:18] but it's concerning anyway it's not
[11:19] normal so let's just keep
[11:23] that in prayer the guy
[11:25] uh the doctor wasn't so concerned
[11:29] um but I got to go back in a couple of
[11:30] months and have another blood test so
[11:31] let's just pray that those numbers are
[11:33] back down
[11:34] as we get older men you know what I'm
[11:36] talking about so just uh
[11:39] keep those things in our prayer we all
[11:42] are falling apart
[11:43] and on the outside but let's build
[11:46] ourselves up on the inside hey man
[11:48] unless that let that man take over all
[11:51] right and he won't need a uh he'll never
[11:53] need an operation and thank God he'll
[11:55] never have a blood tests because you
[11:57] know what we've already been our blood's
[11:59] already been tested it's the blood of
[12:01] the Lord Jesus so so we appreciate that
[12:03] so let's bow our heads and remember Dale
[12:05] fabush's family I know that
[12:08] um it looks dark but
[12:11] it ain't dark till it's dark right
[12:13] so let's pray dear Lord we thank you for
[12:16] this evening you give us thank you for
[12:18] the
[12:19] the time we have to come in the middle
[12:21] of the week Lord and I pray that you'd
[12:23] refresh us just for a few moments
[12:25] I'll be with the father's family Lord
[12:27] and just touch Dale's Soul father and
[12:29] and and be with him Lord and his wife
[12:32] and different and the family
[12:35] Lord I pray that you would just be with
[12:37] each one that's not here sister Freda
[12:39] different ones Lord that we always think
[12:41] about Lord
[12:43] we pray that you would just raise each
[12:45] one of them up father for your honor and
[12:47] Glory you're the Healer you'll never
[12:49] stop being a Healer till we walk into
[12:51] that new body
[12:52] father I pray that you just touch each
[12:54] one Lord that's here today that may be
[12:57] sick Lord into different things we pray
[12:59] Lord that you would help us that this
[13:02] weekend will come together and and and
[13:05] get all Minds clear all Hearts clear and
[13:08] and as we're going to speak just a
[13:10] moment about reconciling
[13:12] through water baptism through through
[13:15] um vow renewals and Lord we want to
[13:18] renew our vow to you father because
[13:20] you're our husband
[13:21] you're a husband you're a father you're
[13:24] all the different titles Lord let's see
[13:27] you tonight
[13:28] as our reconciler the one that brings
[13:32] everything back to where it's supposed
[13:35] to be you're the only one who can do it
[13:36] Lord
[13:37] we pray that you'd just bless Lord the
[13:39] ones in the Foreign Fields we think
[13:40] about them Lord doing their job and we
[13:43] pray that you bless them in the
[13:44] Philippines in Jamaica and the different
[13:46] places India that we support I pray this
[13:48] should be with them Lord just take care
[13:50] of us in the first of all this service
[13:51] you take over lord and you have the
[13:54] preeminence in Jesus name we pray
[13:56] amen part 105 in the beginning was word
[14:00] words with God and the Word was God and
[14:02] that word was made flesh that's so
[14:05] important that we see that the word
[14:08] Everybody's scared when you say flesh
[14:10] when you say flesh everybody's like no
[14:12] there's no way you know the flesh is you
[14:14] know it's just evil and it's well in a
[14:18] sense it it will be sticky until the
[14:20] time that we take the body change but we
[14:23] got to start somewhere believing that
[14:26] what's inside of us is stronger than
[14:28] what's on the outside of us and what's
[14:30] on the inside of us is gonna what it's
[14:32] gonna showcase itself on the outside and
[14:35] our flesh will be changed we're not
[14:37] going to be changed into rocks and and
[14:39] stone and and paper no we're still going
[14:42] to be flashed for an eternity
[14:44] but there's a way that we have to get
[14:48] there and that's what the prescription
[14:50] is Brother Willie was talking about this
[14:51] weekend there's a prescribed way of
[14:53] doing things and there's a prescription
[14:55] and you've got to go by that
[14:56] prescription you can't go any other way
[14:59] because you know why he saw that that
[15:01] was the only way that was needed for us
[15:02] to get that way to get to get to a body
[15:05] change it would be held as glory to
[15:07] glory the only begotten of the father
[15:08] full of grace and truth it's second
[15:10] Peter 1 and besides this what besides
[15:13] the new birth besides my beginning of
[15:17] Faith besides my uh as we're going to
[15:20] speak in just a little bit about you've
[15:22] been reconciled in your soul but what
[15:24] about the rest of you
[15:26] all right because reconciling brings it
[15:28] all back together not just pieces all
[15:30] right and we'll talk about that in just
[15:32] a minute because brother Brown says we
[15:33] go way up here until we have to have
[15:35] godliness till God requires these things
[15:37] why because we're not as close to God as
[15:40] we should be
[15:41] even at Faith we're not as closest to
[15:43] God as we should be I mean were you
[15:45] satisfied today you got born again no
[15:47] that just started your journey that just
[15:50] started your yearning to want to be more
[15:52] and to have more of God and besides this
[15:54] in other words besides your experience
[15:57] besides your born-again experience
[15:59] giving all Dylan just add to your faith
[16:02] virtue into virtue knowledge and all his
[16:05] Temperance tempers patience patience
[16:06] godliness excuse me godliness brother
[16:09] the kindness and brotherly kindness
[16:11] charity and we'll get to that in just a
[16:13] little bit so let's have a seat and I'll
[16:15] I'll read this first Timothy 3 16 it
[16:18] says without controversy I like that
[16:20] scripture without controversy in other
[16:22] words in other words you know what Paul
[16:24] said Paul said I'm not going to stand
[16:25] here and argue with you
[16:27] I know who I believe and I am what
[16:31] persuaded that he's able
[16:33] to do that in other words without
[16:35] controversy great is a mystery of
[16:37] godliness so so now watch you can take
[16:40] that and go all right well that great is
[16:42] the mystery of godliness it's so far out
[16:44] there we can't get to it no Paul brings
[16:46] it right back in
[16:48] and since God was manifested in the
[16:50] flesh justifying the spirit scene of
[16:51] angels preaching the Gentiles believed
[16:54] on the world received up into Glory now
[16:55] where is he now
[16:56] he's in me and you
[16:58] actually came back into us as we're
[17:00] going to speak up just a moment about uh
[17:02] that just came to me a few minutes ago
[17:04] about reconciliation
[17:06] what am I saying
[17:09] reconciliation does one thing it repairs
[17:12] our relationship when you reconcile with
[17:14] your wife or you reconcile with your
[17:16] parents you haven't met them you know
[17:17] you hadn't talked to them for years
[17:18] because of some XYZ and then it comes
[17:21] back and and you reconcile back it
[17:23] brings you back into Fellowship well God
[17:26] now when you get born again you are
[17:28] coming into fellowship with God but
[17:30] you're not in full fellowship with God
[17:32] there are things that God is not going
[17:35] to touch
[17:36] until you get rid of them
[17:38] amen
[17:40] no they're not going to touch just like
[17:41] brother Brown preached doors indoors he
[17:43] steps into your house you let him into
[17:45] your house but you close this door of
[17:47] Pride and you close this door of this
[17:48] and this door of that and you don't let
[17:50] him in well he wants to get in there and
[17:53] clean that house up but he will not
[17:55] knock the door down
[17:57] because you make a choice
[17:59] to let him or not to let him
[18:01] but that word controversy is without
[18:03] Strife without dispute without
[18:05] quarreling
[18:07] great is the mystery of godliness and
[18:09] then brother will he talked touched on
[18:11] the Plan of Redemption which began all
[18:13] the way into Genesis and it tells us it
[18:15] did not change
[18:17] the plan never changed so the plan was
[18:19] exactly but thank God he did it by what
[18:21] Romans 8 29 though though for whom he
[18:25] did what number one he forew R4 no
[18:29] he also did number two predestinate okay
[18:32] I see what you're gonna do now I'm going
[18:34] to predestinate that to come to pass
[18:37] because I've already seen it come to
[18:39] pass to me that's so simple that's why
[18:41] brother Brown could stand in the pulpit
[18:43] and he could stand there and he said he
[18:46] said I see you as a young child and you
[18:48] were run over or a dog him he's
[18:51] watching their life
[18:53] there is no guesswork to it they were
[18:56] saying it was mental telepathy well
[18:58] mental telepathy doesn't always work
[18:59] because it works off of sometimes you
[19:02] know your psychiatrist Works off of what
[19:04] you say
[19:05] and then what they're learned or taught
[19:07] to do they react in this way
[19:10] all right that's just like the people
[19:11] that call you and people call a guy
[19:13] called me one time and he said
[19:15] he said Mr Dell
[19:17] he said I've got this plan for you and
[19:19] he says he said I got this service and
[19:22] you know 100 and something channels and
[19:24] he goes into this big spell and
[19:26] I said well that's great man I said I'm
[19:29] not going to tell you that that I have
[19:31] another plan I'm not going to tell you
[19:33] that I use Comcast instead of what
[19:35] you're I said I'm going to tell you I
[19:36] don't even have a television
[19:39] Dead Silence
[19:41] because he's reading down you know if
[19:43] you say this this is what he's supposed
[19:44] to react if you say this they've got a
[19:47] predetermined script that if you say
[19:50] this we say this well there wasn't one
[19:52] on there that says I don't have a
[19:53] television because he said oh and I said
[19:56] you may think I'm lying just to get you
[19:57] off the phone I said but I do not have a
[19:59] television that's hooked up to any kind
[20:00] of cable
[20:01] okay thank you click you know he goes on
[20:04] to the next person
[20:05] but that's why the one he foreknew so
[20:08] God he predestinated by what he saw
[20:11] he already knew what was he didn't guess
[20:13] what was going to happen brother Brown
[20:15] didn't guess what was going to happen he
[20:18] saw what was going to happen and
[20:20] actually he saw the word of God being
[20:22] made manifest in a bride in a vision of
[20:24] us walking marching where upward
[20:28] he saw us
[20:30] he saw us marching towards something oh
[20:33] yeah we might get out of step and we
[20:34] have got out of Step but he saw us
[20:36] marching and and going forward and and
[20:39] why can't we get into that vision
[20:43] get into what he saw
[20:45] play our part
[20:48] so he4 knew it but so he by by
[20:51] foreseeing it he could predetermine
[20:52] everything and as brother Brown said
[20:56] that was a bad word to use because
[20:57] predetermined is
[21:00] you were predetermined by God to be here
[21:02] tonight
[21:03] because he saw you billions of years ago
[21:06] sitting here tonight
[21:08] that's the way he predetermined he
[21:09] didn't predetermined because he made you
[21:11] come here
[21:13] now he gave you a desire he gave he
[21:16] gives everybody a desire to do something
[21:18] and then what does the world do they
[21:20] drink it up and they smoke it up and
[21:22] they peel it up and they this and that
[21:24] and the other that's what they do
[21:26] but what do you and I do we come to
[21:28] church to hear from God because that
[21:30] desire is there
[21:32] and brother Brown said if there had to
[21:34] be if there was a fish there had to be
[21:37] water already there so if you have a
[21:39] desire to be born again healed saved
[21:42] Sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost
[21:44] there's something there for you tonight
[21:45] to get if you desire it and he saw
[21:49] whether you desire or not
[21:51] so we can't fool God right
[21:54] so he predetermines by what he foresaw
[21:56] and I can understand that I got it all
[21:59] right and I hope you do too you've been
[22:00] taught as brother Willie Smiley uh we
[22:04] were talking about afterwards
[22:06] and uh
[22:08] then today
[22:10] I was talking brother Andre
[22:12] and
[22:13] um
[22:14] I want you all to understand something
[22:16] brother Dale may be my dad my my my
[22:19] blood
[22:20] but he's helped so many people that
[22:22] you'll never know
[22:25] he helped us sure but he helped so many
[22:28] people that you'll never know until we
[22:30] get to the other side
[22:32] that's been in that's been affected
[22:35] I say even infected
[22:38] I like being like being infected by God
[22:41] but but you hear people talk about
[22:42] things and how that they wouldn't have
[22:44] been here if they hadn't been here and
[22:46] how Brother Willie Willie stood and and
[22:48] and told us about because we were
[22:50] talking about the the uh the doctrine
[22:53] that some of the great people are you
[22:55] know have been preaching for years that
[22:56] Adam had to put his natural seed into
[22:58] Eve's womb to save her
[23:01] and he said I heard your dad the first
[23:03] time say that you know 15 18 years ago
[23:06] and he said that stuck with me and he
[23:07] said I knew they were wrong
[23:10] okay well praise God what if they heard
[23:12] something else like everybody else heard
[23:14] something else
[23:18] got to give him a rose while they're
[23:19] here
[23:21] but I tell you it's it's uh ministers
[23:24] don't
[23:26] you know sometimes uh Bob was struggling
[23:28] Wednesday night I know that and
[23:29] sometimes you know it's like you're
[23:31] preaching to cardboard people and and
[23:34] I'm just being honest
[23:37] and you know it's just it's going out
[23:39] there and it's coming back it's going
[23:41] out there and coming back but somebody
[23:43] is paying attention somewhere
[23:47] somewhere he said if you'll preach my
[23:50] word it'll not return void it will
[23:53] accomplish what it set out to do
[23:56] and as you and I know many many times we
[23:58] have sat and even I well I'm going to
[24:01] just admit it I've sat down and brother
[24:02] Dale's preaching his heart out and I
[24:04] didn't get a thing
[24:06] that's great of what's coming out you
[24:08] know I it wasn't for me but somewhere
[24:11] down the line something would ring later
[24:13] on
[24:15] as we process what's going on we go like
[24:18] Brother Willie he heard that Doctrine he
[24:20] hurt and sat in the meetings
[24:23] how the great brother you know I say
[24:25] great brother he's well known the
[24:26] message
[24:27] would preached that Doctrine and he said
[24:29] it just didn't ring true to me
[24:32] he said then I heard your dad explain it
[24:34] 15 18 whatever 20 years ago this stuff's
[24:37] the old hat
[24:38] I don't want to say old but old but but
[24:40] it's old hat we've been going through
[24:42] this for a long period of time
[24:44] but but just thank God when you set some
[24:46] time and you don't think nothing's going
[24:48] on nothing's happening well maybe it's
[24:49] not your time to have something
[24:50] happening but let somebody else don't
[24:52] stand in the way in but let somebody
[24:53] else have something all right hey man
[24:55] well I said before when you pray don't
[24:58] you don't so much pray for the person
[24:59] that's okay you can but just pray that
[25:01] you don't hinder them
[25:03] you can handle them from getting healed
[25:06] so listen take me take me out of the
[25:08] equation
[25:09] take my sin and my bad thoughts and all
[25:12] the things that I did the day before and
[25:13] the day of all the fights and angries
[25:16] and all the things I got into take that
[25:18] away Lord so that you can flow to that
[25:20] person
[25:21] and let their faith
[25:24] connect with God's faith and then get
[25:27] something and not me and you standing
[25:28] away like a cardboard doll and just
[25:31] stand there and you know keep God from
[25:33] working I don't want to ever be where
[25:35] where I'm accused of of stopping
[25:39] somebody from getting their healing or
[25:40] stop somebody from getting their
[25:41] salvation I don't want that
[25:44] and I know you shouldn't either all
[25:45] right
[25:46] that's why we pray when we get here we
[25:48] try to get here a little bit early so
[25:50] that we can you know get that stuff out
[25:52] you know kind of let the washing of the
[25:55] water the word you know you listen to a
[25:57] prophet just listening to a profitable
[25:59] drive a devil crazy
[26:01] hey man you listen to Brother Brian I
[26:04] mean if you have a little something
[26:05] going on in your life you're going home
[26:08] yeah yeah yeah you just start you know
[26:11] get a little nervous and then that thing
[26:12] leaves you and I thank God
[26:15] you think I'm crazy what did David do
[26:17] when when Saul when Saul was vexed with
[26:20] a with a spirit
[26:22] he called David in
[26:23] David played the harp and the Bible said
[26:26] the evil spirits left Saul
[26:28] amen so let's don't Discount Music
[26:30] either so and the song leader said thank
[26:34] you very much all right moreover whom he
[26:37] did predestinate then he also called
[26:40] number three and whom he called number
[26:42] three then he also Justified and whom he
[26:45] justified them he also glorified now all
[26:49] this is made by this one little word
[26:51] right there Grace
[26:52] it's all through Grace by grace are you
[26:55] saved through faith all right so the
[26:58] grace of God is what saw you right here
[27:00] at number one he saw you on it more than
[27:04] you wanted to go do this and that and
[27:05] the other more than you wanted to drink
[27:07] anymore you know sometimes you just got
[27:08] tired of being sick and tired right we
[27:10] always say that but I got tired of being
[27:13] sick and tired
[27:15] and when you do that something is going
[27:18] to you're either going to become hard
[27:20] shell
[27:22] and never make it back
[27:24] are you become so soft
[27:27] because remember he gives you a new
[27:28] heart
[27:30] that sanctification not at the new birth
[27:31] that sanctification to soften you up so
[27:34] he can speak to us
[27:36] the word of God in the same way with the
[27:38] sanctification that we're under now
[27:39] we're under the second work of
[27:41] sanctification not the sanctification to
[27:44] get cleaned up to get born again if
[27:46] you're if you're already born again you
[27:47] don't need to get cleaned up and get
[27:48] born again again all right that's why I
[27:51] say I like what a minister said he said
[27:53] look all these people that get baptized
[27:55] three or four five and six times he said
[27:56] what happens is he said you just you
[27:58] know you'll get a bad thought or you'll
[27:59] have a bad Daniel so I think I need to
[28:01] get rebaptized no you don't need to get
[28:02] rebaptized you need to repent
[28:05] just repent and go on
[28:09] we're gonna have a baptism we baptized
[28:11] several over again and that's okay but
[28:14] sometimes that water will not wash your
[28:17] bad thoughts bats in that it won't Wash
[28:19] It Away
[28:21] you need help somewhere else you don't
[28:23] need help in the water
[28:24] now in the water way is the way to go
[28:26] it's a way to get started we can't go
[28:28] around it
[28:30] but once we go through it let's don't go
[28:32] back and go through it again
[28:34] Let's cross that River and continue on
[28:37] whom he justified he also glorified by
[28:40] grace are you saved through faith now
[28:41] watch what brother Brown says so
[28:43] foreknowledge looks back and says that
[28:45] what he foresaw what this
[28:48] this right here and he knows that's the
[28:50] reason he could tell what the end was
[28:52] from the beginning and therefore knowing
[28:54] that all these marvelous days that we're
[28:56] living in now you know brother Ryan he
[28:58] tells us he said he's been 30 something
[28:59] years waiting on to preach to Statue of
[29:02] perfect man it's been in the Bible for
[29:03] two thousand years
[29:05] all right those virtues have been in the
[29:07] Bible for two thousand years and they
[29:09] were written by people that were
[29:11] involved in those virtues that the
[29:13] virtues were flowing the prophet says
[29:16] flowing through their life
[29:18] but then
[29:20] Satan
[29:22] the effects of the word got to eat down
[29:26] oh that's okay you don't have to have
[29:29] uh you need to have worldly knowledge
[29:32] not the knowledge of God
[29:34] no
[29:35] you gotta have the knowledge of God
[29:39] and therefore knowing that all these
[29:40] marvelous days that we're living in now
[29:42] and to stand and witness and see the
[29:44] things same way with me standing here
[29:46] today and you sitting there today where
[29:49] brother Brown preached this when in 1956
[29:54] wow that's what 50
[29:57] 60.
[29:58] 70 years ago almost
[30:02] what if we see what are we seeing now
[30:05] that he didn't even get to see
[30:08] what are we seeing now that he didn't
[30:11] even get to see and he's saying we're
[30:13] seeing these things now
[30:15] and witnessing now and see the things
[30:18] that we've seen God had to make a
[30:20] preparation for it and he foresaw a
[30:24] group of people that would take this
[30:27] message and live it right
[30:30] just plain as a day there's somebody
[30:32] gonna make it amen amen and just you
[30:34] just gotta say it's me
[30:38] God you saw me
[30:44] then we were the little conversation we
[30:46] all had about
[30:48] um
[30:49] you know you
[30:51] you look out in them and on the internet
[30:53] and you
[30:54] you listen and you watch
[30:58] when you see people that
[31:00] that don't have a lot of background like
[31:02] we were talking about
[31:05] tell us that we don't have to have a
[31:06] choice anymore that we don't have we're
[31:08] not a choice we always was this
[31:11] well that to me that just takes
[31:13] Redemption out of the way
[31:15] then we always was this great something
[31:17] and we always you know we never did no
[31:19] you were a sinner
[31:21] I sinned
[31:26] but watch what brother Brown said watch
[31:28] how watch how wonderful he says this
[31:31] if God did that in other words bringing
[31:34] you here making you a healthy guy God's
[31:37] seen so in you when you were young and
[31:40] pretty and women has got old you men who
[31:42] are young strong and healthy how you
[31:44] enjoyed being a man your low companion
[31:46] if God did that without you having any
[31:48] say so into it now see that looks like
[31:50] you didn't have a choice well listen you
[31:52] didn't have a choice to get here he's
[31:54] going to tell you that but once you get
[31:56] here
[31:57] the reason they put you here
[31:59] he made a choice
[32:02] how many millions of sperm died when you
[32:04] were conceived
[32:07] how many eggs died you were conceived
[32:10] you didn't have one thing to do with
[32:11] that
[32:12] but God had to get you here that way
[32:14] because of what happened in the garden
[32:17] he had to get you here brother Brown
[32:19] said he read this one to this one this
[32:20] one this one to get you here in other
[32:23] words to get your character here to get
[32:25] your person here so that he can deal
[32:28] with that person into set time
[32:30] and then knowing that we have to go
[32:33] through this statue of perfect man he
[32:34] put a group of people on the Earth that
[32:36] can live these virtues in the darkest
[32:39] hour not the first church age I'm
[32:41] talking about the last Church age you
[32:44] and I our commission is to live those
[32:46] things just like they did back Peter
[32:48] James and John we love them we
[32:50] appreciate them they're gone
[32:53] We Are The Living Word made manifest
[32:55] today they spoke of us every prophet in
[32:59] the Old Testament spoke of you sitting
[33:01] here tonight
[33:02] that they wanted to come to this they
[33:04] wanted to be able to live what they were
[33:07] saying
[33:09] David didn't live what he all he was
[33:11] saying all those psalms
[33:14] he wasn't perfect he was a murderer
[33:17] he was a liar
[33:18] he was an adulterer
[33:21] not a good poster child for Christianity
[33:24] but God loved him God knew his heart he
[33:27] knew he didn't want to do those things
[33:29] same way I mean you he knows we don't
[33:31] want to do things while we're while oh
[33:34] I'm sorry if
[33:35] y'all haven't done anything wrong since
[33:37] you got born again okay well I'm sorry
[33:38] well I skip all that
[33:42] I don't think so
[33:44] we sin every day
[33:46] you make mistakes every day
[33:49] but now let's continue if God did that
[33:51] without you having any say so into it
[33:53] now that's the truth
[33:55] you never said make me thus
[33:58] who'd take any thought and could add one
[34:00] cubic to a stature
[34:02] but if he made you thus without you
[34:04] having anything to say how much more can
[34:07] he look through his brooding give you a
[34:10] choice
[34:12] and you're on the basis of free more
[34:15] what is free moral agency
[34:17] number one it's free
[34:21] boy that takes a lot
[34:23] it says right there free
[34:27] moral and who's the agency you
[34:30] and you are a moral or an immoral person
[34:33] but you have free will
[34:37] inside of you to do what you want to do
[34:40] even now when you're born again tonight
[34:42] you can be better or worse
[34:45] and you're on the basis of free moral
[34:47] agency you can turn this down
[34:52] or you can accept it
[34:53] now that sounds to me like a choice
[34:56] that don't sound like to me you're gonna
[34:58] accept it and that's just the way it's
[35:00] gonna be
[35:00] no
[35:02] you turn it down is to be lost
[35:05] and remain potash and calcium and
[35:07] petroleum but to accept it and to have a
[35:10] new heart a new spirit in his Spirit
[35:12] part of the logos part of that John 1 1.
[35:17] in the beginning was the logos
[35:19] and the logos was made flesh and the low
[35:22] glass was made flesh in your flesh right
[35:26] part of the Locust in you controlling
[35:29] your emotions
[35:32] what are we dealing with to me
[35:34] as brother Jack was talking about you
[35:36] know having battles in the wars well
[35:38] that's your emotions right there
[35:42] okay now you can have an emotion of
[35:44] having Temperance and be really bad
[35:47] but you can have an emotion of
[35:49] temperance as Jesus did and drove the
[35:52] people out of the
[35:53] out of the temple but he turned around
[35:55] and died for every one of them
[35:57] gave his life so that they could be
[35:58] saved and who knows to take the internet
[36:00] all right just not part of the story
[36:02] controlling your emotion and when he
[36:04] Coos through his word you coup back and
[36:07] answer now why would you give an answer
[36:09] if you already if it was just all
[36:10] stamped and set and dry cut
[36:14] you have to answer listen we'll have to
[36:17] answer him being a Christian we got to
[36:18] answer for the things that we do
[36:20] someday way back before there was ever a
[36:22] light on the earth our bodies laid in
[36:24] this dust look our bodies
[36:27] not our soul
[36:29] if you're born again today your soul was
[36:32] with God and in God if you're not it was
[36:36] somewhere that God had set aside to give
[36:38] everybody a soul
[36:40] is that the only way you can explain it
[36:41] there's somewhere God gives everybody a
[36:44] soul
[36:46] All Souls are mine Satan can't make us
[36:48] all God made Hitler's soul but then what
[36:52] he done he put Hitler on display and
[36:54] gave Hitler a choice and he made his
[36:56] choice and we see by history that he
[36:58] made a pretty bad one all right but God
[37:00] made his soul
[37:02] so you can't blame the devil for making
[37:04] it so
[37:06] you blame Hitler for leaning toward the
[37:09] devil and giving the devil his soul
[37:13] everybody with me
[37:15] way back before there was light on the
[37:17] earth our bodies bodies laid in the dust
[37:19] not our soul
[37:21] you're made from the dust out of the
[37:23] potash calcium petroleum Cosmic light
[37:25] God sent forth the great Holy Spirit to
[37:28] brew brood over the Earth and as he
[37:30] brooded the flowers came up the birds
[37:32] flew out animals came from the earth
[37:34] then came a man now listen that man
[37:37] didn't come up out of the earth a soul
[37:42] he was already that Genesis 1 26th man
[37:45] he was the soul of God
[37:47] because God had pointed that before he
[37:49] put him in human flesh
[37:52] you know you you hear him preaching wall
[37:54] the seed was laying in the ground the
[37:56] seed for your body absolutely but the
[37:59] seed for your soul is in God
[38:03] even your mom and daddy didn't give you
[38:05] a soul
[38:07] they had nothing to do with your life
[38:10] they had something to do with get the
[38:12] shell here
[38:13] but nothing to do with your life
[38:16] then came a man in his sinned and
[38:18] separated himself from The Fellowship Of
[38:19] God that kind of shows to me there was a
[38:21] choice made somewhere
[38:23] and because of this horrible thing he
[38:25] was commanded by God to return back to
[38:27] the dust of the Earth
[38:28] but oh Lord God we are so glad that
[38:31] before he returns you have promised a
[38:33] redeemer and today since he has come and
[38:36] sent forth the Holy Spirit again now
[38:38] he's still brooding over the dust our
[38:40] bodies and if he raised me and brought
[38:43] me to what I am now without having a
[38:46] choice now he's talking about bringing
[38:47] his bodies talking about bringing the
[38:48] person here on Earth to do what to make
[38:51] a choice
[38:53] how much more will he raise me from the
[38:56] dust of the earth after we've made a
[38:58] choice
[39:01] and he has brewed it to us and we brewed
[39:04] back to him we love him
[39:08] Jesus brother Brown said 1959 he says
[39:12] now you've got to make a choice Jesus
[39:14] said let every man's word be a line mine
[39:16] be true
[39:17] now you've got to make up your mind
[39:19] you've got to make a choice
[39:21] and this may be your last time to make a
[39:24] choice
[39:26] it doesn't sound like he always was
[39:29] tomorrow may be too late God might have
[39:33] chose you to eternal life remember he
[39:36] died that everyone may have eternal life
[39:40] life every person even Cain yeah
[39:45] even Judas
[39:48] but if you don't make up your mind and
[39:51] accept it somebody else will take your
[39:53] place
[39:54] what don't seem like it's all cut and
[39:56] dry does it seems like you got a little
[39:58] bit to do with it because if God won't
[39:59] give you the Holy Ghost because you
[40:00] don't want to give it to somebody else
[40:02] I'm just reading what brother Brown said
[40:04] okay
[40:05] I'm reading a quote
[40:07] I know it's before the sales but
[40:09] blah blah blah
[40:12] I believe it's all true
[40:14] amen
[40:16] so backpack back in the back part of
[40:18] God's mind
[40:21] let's
[40:22] you know we quote this
[40:26] a hundred thousand times
[40:31] but he ever been back there
[40:36] you ever been back there
[40:37] does God ever give you a revelation of
[40:39] something you never knew before in your
[40:41] life that it was just so contrary to
[40:44] what you believed
[40:46] that was the back part of God's mind
[40:48] because God does have a mind of thinking
[40:51] now listen I want to tell you something
[40:52] he has a back part of God's mind he has
[40:55] something that he was going to achieve
[40:57] so there's a part that he kept
[41:00] but now remember Judas was in the mind
[41:03] of God
[41:06] Adolf Hitler was in the mind of God
[41:10] but he was a part of the mind of God
[41:15] You and I by the new birth are the very
[41:17] thinking of God
[41:20] can y'all say it man
[41:23] if you're not then
[41:27] so we have been literally back in the
[41:29] back part of God's mind where nobody's
[41:31] been before
[41:32] there's a group listen everybody was in
[41:34] the mind of God where do you think
[41:35] everybody came from what I talk about
[41:36] the souls God said All Souls are mine in
[41:39] other words I am the source of life I'm
[41:41] giving out life
[41:43] not billions of life and he's not no one
[41:46] less person than he was when he gave the
[41:48] first one but there's eight billion
[41:50] people in the world now we've gained
[41:51] another billion
[41:53] God gave everyone of them life
[41:56] to make a choice
[41:58] to have eternal life
[42:00] to me that's so plain
[42:02] but if you're born again tonight you
[42:04] have access to the back part of God's
[42:07] mind
[42:08] where there's a place that he is
[42:11] thinking and going to achieve a motive
[42:14] and he's going to let himself be
[42:16] expressed in you
[42:19] not the world
[42:20] in you
[42:22] everybody with me
[42:24] First Corinthians 6 9 says know you not
[42:27] that the unrighteous shall not inherit
[42:28] the kingdom of God listen the
[42:30] unrighteous are in the mind of God
[42:33] everybody there's not a person on the
[42:35] earth that God said well I never thought
[42:37] of that one
[42:38] amen
[42:40] everything he thought of it all
[42:44] and there is an unrighteous part not of
[42:47] God now listen that's why brother Brown
[42:49] explained many many times that that when
[42:51] a baby is born it's perfect because it
[42:53] that Soul comes from God it can't come
[42:55] from God marred
[42:58] hello come on somebody it can't come
[43:01] marred it has to come perfect and pure
[43:04] because remember perfect is complete
[43:06] Perfect's not that he never pooped he
[43:08] never peed he never threw up he never
[43:10] told a lie that ain't perfect in God
[43:14] but he was complete
[43:16] but he made a choice or she made a
[43:19] choice at the age of accountability to
[43:22] become righteous or unrighteous
[43:26] as we see many times brother Brown tells
[43:28] us and we'll get into that maybe later
[43:30] on way later on when we get up to the to
[43:33] the headstone
[43:35] there are some people that got wrote in
[43:37] a book that got their names erased
[43:41] so they were in the
[43:46] [Applause]
[43:49] Lamb's Book of Life The Eternal section
[43:53] but got them erased
[43:58] because of their choice
[44:00] not because of God's choice or he
[44:03] couldn't say I wish that all listen he
[44:06] wished it I'll be in one book
[44:09] he wished he didn't have to have seven
[44:11] dimensions he wished he didn't have to
[44:13] have this fellowship with man why can't
[44:16] like Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden
[44:18] I like Brother Willy what he was saying
[44:20] but he never said this part but what a
[44:22] crushing blow
[44:23] he's talking about being crushed what a
[44:25] crushing below to humanity
[44:27] Adam never had to worry about arthritis
[44:31] pre-fall
[44:33] never had to go to the bathroom
[44:35] never had an upset stomach everything
[44:37] you eat was perfect yeah
[44:40] didn't have to worry and build a fence
[44:42] because of bad neighbors
[44:44] praise the Lord anyhow
[44:49] he didn't have to be easy he didn't have
[44:52] to build I shouldn't have said that I'm
[44:53] sorry he but he did I mean why do we
[44:56] build a fence
[44:57] don't fences make good neighbors that's
[44:59] what I heard
[45:01] but he had to build a fence to keep
[45:03] cheetah from coming through his house
[45:05] and eating him
[45:07] it was a crushing blow to Adam because
[45:09] he had control of everything in control
[45:10] of the tree said hey I want that tree
[45:12] over there I'll move it over this way
[45:14] I don't want that mountain over there
[45:15] it's hiding my view move it over this
[45:17] way then all of a sudden one day
[45:19] he looks at the mountain and looks at
[45:21] the tree and goes
[45:22] I can't do a thing about it
[45:25] I can't even save my own wife
[45:28] so you know what
[45:30] I'm gonna go out with her
[45:33] I can't save her but I'm going with her
[45:37] think about that
[45:39] know ye not that the unrighteous shall
[45:41] not inherit the kingdom of God be not
[45:43] deceived neither fornicators idolters
[45:45] adulterers or feminate abuse of himself
[45:47] of mankind thieves covetous drunkards
[45:50] nice people
[45:52] um no revilers nor extortioners shall
[45:54] inherit the kingdom of God
[45:57] and such for some of you
[45:59] and me
[46:00] but you are washed but you are
[46:02] Sanctified but you are justified in the
[46:05] name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit
[46:07] of our God
[46:09] Lamb's Book of Life Eternal section
[46:11] listen when when when
[46:14] the lamb took the book in Revelations 5
[46:17] he took one book
[46:20] it didn't have different sections in it
[46:27] it was the book of the redeemed
[46:29] on Earth
[46:30] now there's some people going to be
[46:31] redeemed in heaven everybody with me
[46:33] hello come on foolish version is going
[46:36] to be can't be redeemed here they're
[46:37] going to be redeemed there
[46:39] cup of water my name's gonna be redeemed
[46:41] there those different things like that
[46:43] but you got to be redeemed here
[46:45] that book that he told was because the
[46:48] lamb was slain and you accepted it
[46:50] Hallelujah he puts your name in a book
[46:56] but then he opened it up to show you you
[46:58] were inside of it
[47:00] what a glorious thing we've come to this
[47:03] day and time
[47:05] if you ask John Wesley and I don't know
[47:07] maybe I'm going out on the way I'm here
[47:09] you asked John Wesley do you know your
[47:11] names in the book he said I don't know I
[47:13] can't say it I can't see everything
[47:16] he couldn't
[47:18] listen folks John Wesley was a church
[47:20] age Messenger right
[47:23] Luther was a church-aged messenger
[47:26] but listen they weren't in the back part
[47:28] of God's mind like me and you are
[47:32] all right
[47:34] because God had to wink at the ignorance
[47:36] of him knowing they baptized people
[47:39] wrong
[47:41] they had false Doctrine
[47:43] that's why they had to die to be purged
[47:46] come on
[47:48] God said a prophet
[47:50] to put us in that part of God's mind
[47:52] that was perfect
[47:54] it had no flaw in Doctrine God doesn't
[47:58] matter it doesn't matter about your flaw
[48:00] in your body
[48:01] he wants your soul to be unflawed if
[48:04] that's a word
[48:06] that's why he gave us this that's why he
[48:08] gave us a message I'll read in just a
[48:11] minute a message of reconciliation
[48:12] because he gave us a word of
[48:14] reconciliation
[48:16] how can you have a message without the
[48:18] word
[48:21] listen John Wesley could not stand in
[48:25] his congregation and say what I'm
[48:27] preaching to you is going to change your
[48:29] body
[48:31] as great as he preached sanctification
[48:33] he could not preach us brother John he
[48:36] couldn't preach that group of people to
[48:38] a body change
[48:40] you know how I know that they're all in
[48:41] the grave
[48:43] you are not
[48:45] we have a chance
[48:47] we're given the opportunity to be in
[48:50] this age to give us a chance because he
[48:52] what force off somebody would come to
[48:54] the body change
[48:57] God is my strength and power he maketh
[48:59] my way perfect
[49:03] Philippians 2 15 that you may be
[49:05] blameless and harmless
[49:07] the sons of God without rebuke
[49:10] in the midst of a cooking perverse
[49:12] Nation God didn't put us in a bubble and
[49:14] say live like a Christian
[49:18] Saint John 17 he didn't say Lord take
[49:20] them out of the world put a bubble
[49:22] around them
[49:25] put him on an island Lord
[49:27] with nothing but 1100 sermons
[49:30] now he puts you in the darkest time the
[49:33] darkest hour and some of the worst
[49:35] people to work with in your life
[49:38] I hope nobody from the post office is
[49:40] listening at the moment
[49:42] they did a couple of times have clicked
[49:45] on so
[49:47] I'm not talking about y'all
[49:50] but he did
[49:52] he put us in a wicked and perverse
[49:56] crooked and perverse generation Our
[49:58] Nation
[50:00] among whom you shine
[50:03] as Lots in the world do we shine
[50:06] do we shine in that part that we bump
[50:09] shoulders with the Devil Himself
[50:14] y'all pray for me then come to work with
[50:16] me for a little bit then if y'all just
[50:17] sitting there with you looking at me
[50:18] like that
[50:23] if I don't get any point at this point I
[50:25] want to get across right here
[50:27] Genesis 17 1 now watch when Abram now
[50:30] look watch
[50:32] Abram became who
[50:34] Abraham
[50:36] the father of our faith they're about
[50:39] with me
[50:41] the same guy
[50:43] that when God told him to get up in
[50:46] Genesis 14 12 and 13 14 to get up and
[50:49] leave his
[50:51] job his family
[50:55] and what does he do he gets up and
[50:57] leaves
[50:58] but he takes a lot with him
[51:02] remember when I preached the other day
[51:04] about it's better to obey
[51:08] it's better to obey what God Said
[51:11] than to say I think I'll save my brother
[51:14] that's what Abram was saying come on a
[51:16] lot there's something going on is good I
[51:18] feel it
[51:20] well remember
[51:22] it didn't work out for a lot very well
[51:24] but remember a lot had to write your
[51:25] soul so that's what the Bible says but
[51:29] now watch this scenario just for a
[51:31] minute I know this is kind of getting
[51:32] off but it has a lot to do with the
[51:33] Statue of perfect man but it just came
[51:35] to me last night
[51:37] and when Abram now look Abram
[51:41] was 90 and 9.
[51:43] 9 he was Abram for 99 years
[51:47] a sticker one that laughed at God one
[51:52] that gave his wife away
[51:56] twice
[51:58] uh once when he was Abram and once when
[52:00] he was Abraham
[52:02] hello
[52:03] the Lord Captain Lord that's God
[52:05] Almighty himself Elohim
[52:07] Elohim appeared to Abram
[52:10] and said unto him I am the almighty God
[52:13] walk before me and be thou perfect
[52:19] God had to foreknow
[52:23] Abram was going to be Abraham
[52:26] because in this scripture right here
[52:28] he's not yet
[52:31] what are you saying by the way the even
[52:33] in your darkest time
[52:36] God sees you
[52:39] even your Abram issues
[52:42] he sees in Abraham
[52:45] because Abram became Abraham
[52:49] Hallelujah
[52:50] he became that Abram was part of the
[52:54] name Abraham you even your baby form
[52:58] justification baby form you have a name
[53:01] you're a bride your potential
[53:04] yeah
[53:05] but he said wall before me by black and
[53:09] be perfect
[53:11] even as your Abram comes up
[53:17] right everybody with me
[53:23] now what does that word perfect mean see
[53:24] because everybody and like I said before
[53:26] you try to witness to people and try to
[53:29] try to you know like one of the girls at
[53:31] work hope she's not watching again
[53:34] but she said God's a good God now that's
[53:36] what she said she's a Baptist girl
[53:39] and God doesn't mind
[53:42] if if June wears a dress and she wears
[53:45] pants God's not looking at that she said
[53:47] I didn't say anything no not a word
[53:50] because I'm not going to argue with
[53:51] somebody especially at work
[53:54] okay I have to work with him all the
[53:56] time
[53:57] but I didn't say anything about it but
[53:59] that's their mentality they think
[54:01] Perfection is when I walk through the
[54:03] door that if I have any dust on my shoes
[54:06] or any clods of dirt or some dog
[54:09] it just Falls right off
[54:12] and then when I walk in roses pop up out
[54:15] of the ground
[54:17] and you walk in the door and they're
[54:19] just if it's if it's hot there's a cool
[54:21] breeze just comes right behind you I
[54:22] wish it was that way
[54:25] look in that
[54:27] and you make a mistake I promise you
[54:31] yeah
[54:32] job's accusers will show up all three of
[54:35] them
[54:42] but look this word perfect mean one one
[54:45] who lacks nothing in physical strength
[54:47] or beauty now that's the outside guy
[54:49] sound and wholesome look an ordinary
[54:53] quiet sort of person a complete person
[54:57] morally innocent having integrity
[55:00] one who is morally and ethically pure
[55:03] you say there's no way we can do that
[55:05] well he asked us to be perfect
[55:08] so he asked us to be what complete he
[55:10] asked us to complete our journey and be
[55:13] complete with God not halfway
[55:15] not be halfway reconciled but to be
[55:18] totally reconciled we'll get into that
[55:19] just for a minute because look in
[55:21] Ephesians 4 11 he gave possible prophets
[55:23] pastors teachers Advantage you've read
[55:24] this many times before for what though
[55:26] for the perfecting of the Saints for in
[55:28] other words for the completion of the
[55:31] Saints Journey
[55:32] man they're about with me can I say it
[55:35] that way without uh changing the Bible
[55:38] for the for the perfecting of your life
[55:41] in Christ not your life in the world
[55:45] for the perfecting of the Saints for the
[55:48] work of the ministry for the edifying of
[55:50] the body of Christ till we all look till
[55:52] we all come it's a journey till we all
[55:54] come Abram till we all come Abram to
[55:57] Abraham right
[55:59] God's got patience remember have
[56:01] patience with who God
[56:05] because you know what
[56:07] God doesn't dump it all on you at one
[56:09] time
[56:10] he gives you what you need then he gives
[56:12] you what you need then he gives you what
[56:14] you need then he gives you what you need
[56:16] and if you don't need that he ain't
[56:17] going to give it to you
[56:19] come on somebody
[56:21] or you know what if you need something
[56:22] and and you know God knows the end from
[56:25] the beginning he knows if he just gives
[56:27] it right to you you're going to do
[56:28] something wrong with it
[56:30] that not make him infinite
[56:33] remember God's knows are the best yeses
[56:35] you'll ever get
[56:38] could we all come to the unity of the
[56:40] faith and of the knowledge of the Son of
[56:42] God unto a perfect man because see
[56:45] remember we haven't said this many many
[56:47] times but we did it the first of this
[56:49] this is this is the manifestation of the
[56:53] son of God
[56:55] the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost God in
[56:58] spirit form inside of you working
[57:03] toward that perfection
[57:06] everybody with me that's the Son of God
[57:09] dispensation
[57:11] not the son of man
[57:13] because in the Son of God dispensation
[57:15] you can be fooled
[57:20] you can be fooled
[57:23] John Wesley was fooled
[57:26] he'll tell you
[57:30] could he preached false Doctrine
[57:33] he couldn't get the people all the way
[57:34] out brother Brown tells us they couldn't
[57:36] get everybody out
[57:39] even Columbus some of them hung back
[57:41] Luther didn't want to come out and make
[57:43] a Lutheran Doctrine he wanted a Catholic
[57:46] Church to what conform
[57:48] to this new way of this protesting he
[57:51] was protesting what they were doing
[57:53] right
[57:54] right and then he wrote his thesis but
[57:56] he still had flaws you and I still have
[57:59] flaws under the knowledge of the son of
[58:01] God
[58:02] but was the son of man flawed
[58:05] huh
[58:07] and now what we're supposed to be in the
[58:09] son of man dispensation
[58:15] unto a perfect man look knowledge of the
[58:18] Son of God unto a journey unto a perfect
[58:21] man unto the measure of the stature of
[58:24] the fullness of Christ
[58:26] that we hence for me no more children
[58:30] no more children
[58:32] talks to and fro and carried about will
[58:34] never win the doctrine by the slot of
[58:36] man and cutting crafting us whereby they
[58:38] lie and wait to deceive
[58:40] we were talking a few minutes ago about
[58:43] being under the ministry of this church
[58:44] here brother Dale brother Moe you can't
[58:47] discount him and them and everybody's
[58:49] been here that's preached the truth
[58:52] let's come through here brother Mike all
[58:54] taking different ones you see how that
[58:56] they
[58:57] let me just put it this way
[58:59] I went to Piedmont College and I went to
[59:02] Piedmont College
[59:04] we didn't go to Harvard
[59:07] or Yale
[59:09] are Princeton
[59:14] what for us to do
[59:17] that's a different set of people
[59:19] that's a different set of people that's
[59:21] where you get your road Scholars that's
[59:24] where you get your people that are
[59:25] highly intelligent
[59:27] and that's what we are now
[59:30] you and I the bride in this end time
[59:34] were the epitome
[59:37] way past
[59:38] Rhodes scholar way way past
[59:41] all that worth the knowledge of God not
[59:44] the knowledge of man
[59:46] we can speak things what I tell you
[59:48] before we can speak things
[59:50] we can speak things that the world
[59:52] thinks we're crazy and probably half the
[59:54] people in this message think were crazy
[59:57] hello somebody the ministers will
[59:59] absolutely raise their hand and say
[1:00:00] absolutely that's the truth but I
[1:00:03] thought we were going to be supposed to
[1:00:04] be till we come to the unity of the
[1:00:05] faith and all the Son of God unto a
[1:00:08] perfect man to the measure of the
[1:00:09] stature of the fullness of Christ that
[1:00:10] didn't say we're all in division
[1:00:13] but we carried away with everyone in the
[1:00:15] doctrine brother Smiley this was my
[1:00:17] point brother smiley
[1:00:18] he grew up I know most of you knew who
[1:00:21] brother Coleman was
[1:00:24] um brother Coleman was under brother was
[1:00:26] ordained by Brother Branham and brother
[1:00:29] Coleman was in New York and he had a
[1:00:31] huge following
[1:00:33] uh Hayes was the one that that and I say
[1:00:36] this lightly created
[1:00:38] the seventhunder doctrine
[1:00:41] right Dad your daddy knows he's me I
[1:00:43] think he may have met him one time
[1:00:44] didn't you yep so now that but the end
[1:00:47] he was he was of color he was a black
[1:00:49] man how intelligent had a big church in
[1:00:52] New York but then he decides to start
[1:00:55] forwarding his Doctrine
[1:00:58] cunning craftiness
[1:01:00] comes down to West Palm Beach to brother
[1:01:03] West Coast
[1:01:04] and presents that to him and brother
[1:01:06] Westco says oh that's the greatest thing
[1:01:08] I've ever seen so they enter into that
[1:01:10] uh Doctrine which is totally false
[1:01:14] and if you want to know what it is then
[1:01:16] you'll have to ask Daddy or somebody I
[1:01:18] don't know everything about it but it
[1:01:20] was like seven men and seven you had to
[1:01:22] listen to seven different men and it was
[1:01:24] all kind of mysteries going on it was
[1:01:26] kind of a almost a cult thing honestly
[1:01:29] it was it was almost uh they would say
[1:01:32] phrase words and and it would be that
[1:01:34] you were talking in secret
[1:01:36] kind of like a masonic lodge you know
[1:01:38] kind of like the handshake you know or
[1:01:40] you'll know he's amazing by what he does
[1:01:42] in the room well you know he's a Coleman
[1:01:44] Night by what you know you say or do in
[1:01:46] the room and that's in the message but
[1:01:48] he got caught in that
[1:01:50] Brother Willie got caught in that a lot
[1:01:52] of the brothers got caught in that
[1:01:55] every wind of Doctrine when you hear
[1:01:58] this great thing come out well that's
[1:02:00] good check it by the word
[1:02:03] me anybody Bob brother Aaron brother
[1:02:06] brother brother Louise changing by the
[1:02:08] word of God
[1:02:10] do not take it at face value
[1:02:14] cause I promise you if something inside
[1:02:16] of you just I mean a little click that
[1:02:19] says I don't know if that's true or not
[1:02:21] you better check it out
[1:02:25] I may be deceiving you
[1:02:29] don't get quiet on me
[1:02:31] that's what it says right here every
[1:02:34] wind of doctrine that wind of Doctrine
[1:02:36] went from New York it went down to
[1:02:38] Florida it went out to Arizona it went
[1:02:41] to California just like the wind of
[1:02:43] doctrine of this garbage of brother
[1:02:45] Brown having to come back and put up a
[1:02:46] tent and you know I say garbage I say
[1:02:49] because people are sitting around
[1:02:50] waiting on that to happen and and not
[1:02:52] studying a message for themselves bunch
[1:02:54] of lazy people is all I can say with no
[1:02:57] revelation of what you're doing here
[1:03:00] what you're doing here I want to see
[1:03:03] Jesus Christ come back all right not
[1:03:05] William Bradham I want to see Jesus
[1:03:07] Christ come back inside of us
[1:03:09] [Applause]
[1:03:11] I thought it was Christ in you the hope
[1:03:13] of glory I thought it was Christ that
[1:03:15] was being shown to the world
[1:03:19] but
[1:03:21] you go to Arizona
[1:03:23] where all that got started in Tucson and
[1:03:25] Phoenix and Chris you know he's out
[1:03:27] there in Flagstaff and he fights it all
[1:03:29] the time it's just very prevalent
[1:03:31] because what that wind of Doctrine
[1:03:33] flew out there
[1:03:35] then it flew over here and brother Ryan
[1:03:38] was supposed to get in an airplane when
[1:03:39] he come back
[1:03:41] why would you need an airplane with a
[1:03:42] glorified body
[1:03:44] I don't want one
[1:03:47] and they didn't even keep the thing up
[1:03:49] it's set out there and rusted
[1:03:51] Hey listen at least Muhammad
[1:03:56] since the 1200 12th century when he died
[1:04:00] they've been a horse
[1:04:02] they believe there's been a horse every
[1:04:05] so many days they changed that horse and
[1:04:08] they stand there with a guy
[1:04:09] for thousands of years they've never
[1:04:12] missed a day
[1:04:13] rain wind snow whatever War there's a
[1:04:18] guy standing there because they know
[1:04:19] when Muhammad's coming back he's going
[1:04:21] to need that horse
[1:04:25] they didn't believe brother Brown needed
[1:04:26] an airplane either
[1:04:28] well I'm going I'm going to get out of
[1:04:30] that
[1:04:31] by the slide of men and cunning Crafters
[1:04:33] that's what's here
[1:04:36] listen Satan's in this message to
[1:04:37] deceive you he's not in the world trying
[1:04:39] to deceive you he's in this message
[1:04:41] trying to deceive you he's already got
[1:04:43] them
[1:04:46] sorry if I hurt your feelings but it's
[1:04:48] true
[1:04:49] but look speaking the truth in love
[1:04:52] May grow up into him in all things which
[1:04:54] is the head even Christ
[1:04:56] why would Warner we want to sit and wait
[1:04:58] for something
[1:05:04] the word perfect it means to complete
[1:05:07] it's complete furnishing
[1:05:09] or equipping
[1:05:11] that's what that is we're equipping
[1:05:13] we're being equipped as I said before
[1:05:15] when you took that first cosmonaut and
[1:05:18] you put him in that first spaceship
[1:05:21] now that wasn't Orville and Wilbur
[1:05:23] Wright in that first spaceship
[1:05:26] Orville and Wilbur were on a a piece of
[1:05:29] wood
[1:05:30] with a bicycle of contraption
[1:05:34] and they flew a couple of hundred feet
[1:05:36] and crashed
[1:05:38] but that was the first beginning
[1:05:41] of your Christian Journey
[1:05:46] but look at it now
[1:05:49] they run 14 000 miles an hour now when
[1:05:51] they put up a rocket ship goes up into
[1:05:53] the
[1:05:54] it runs 14 000 miles an hour
[1:05:58] to get out of the atmosphere it's got to
[1:05:59] be way it's got to be a lot
[1:06:01] and you know what they do it now hey
[1:06:03] Elon Musk he's he put that thing in
[1:06:06] forward and drive up and he pulled it in
[1:06:08] reverse and set it back down
[1:06:09] not him himself but whatever that rocket
[1:06:12] you know usually Rockets when we we see
[1:06:15] Rockets they're non-usable I mean they
[1:06:17] use them one time they fall in the ocean
[1:06:19] and I guess they become reefs or
[1:06:22] something I don't know maybe they
[1:06:23] collect them back I don't know but
[1:06:25] they're not really usable and then we
[1:06:26] came out with a lot the Challenger and
[1:06:28] all the the that program and you could
[1:06:30] fly up and fly back
[1:06:33] well now they got that rocket now that
[1:06:36] they can fly it up turn around and park
[1:06:38] it straight back down sometimes it don't
[1:06:40] work sometimes it does
[1:06:43] but at least they're trying listen man
[1:06:45] is trying to make themselves perfect
[1:06:47] themselves by science
[1:06:50] but the more they make the more they die
[1:06:53] but not with Christ
[1:06:55] the more he makes the more you live
[1:06:59] patience
[1:07:01] someone that is not swerved from from
[1:07:03] his deliberate purpose
[1:07:05] like brother Smiley and I were talking
[1:07:07] about
[1:07:08] you take somebody that's
[1:07:12] they had to have patience because what
[1:07:13] happened brother Westco
[1:07:16] uh hurt someone else preach something
[1:07:19] different
[1:07:20] than what the Coleman camp was preaching
[1:07:23] because see they had their own preachers
[1:07:24] and they they kind of stayed in their
[1:07:26] own little
[1:07:27] click so you didn't hear anything from
[1:07:30] the outside you didn't know anything
[1:07:31] from the outside
[1:07:33] but uh a preacher come in and preached
[1:07:36] and blew that thing out of the water
[1:07:39] and helped brother West go and them get
[1:07:41] out of that
[1:07:42] they had patience
[1:07:44] Brother Willie they had patience in what
[1:07:46] they were doing because listen they had
[1:07:48] set their soul on that seventh under
[1:07:50] Doctrine that was it when them seven
[1:07:52] Thunders went off it was seven men if
[1:07:54] you heard him seven men you was going to
[1:07:56] take a body change
[1:07:57] well
[1:07:58] let me let you in on a secret all seven
[1:08:00] of those men are dead
[1:08:06] where's your voice
[1:08:07] I'll take the voice of the seventh angel
[1:08:10] because the Bible said he's not going to
[1:08:12] be silenced
[1:08:13] he's not going to take us down it's
[1:08:15] going to take us up
[1:08:18] so let's have patience
[1:08:20] man who has not swerved from his
[1:08:22] deliberate purpose and his loyalty to
[1:08:24] Faith
[1:08:25] and piety by even the greatest trials
[1:08:27] and sufferings
[1:08:28] patient steadfast
[1:08:31] brother Brown tells us the Statue of
[1:08:33] perfect man it says you're beginning to
[1:08:34] reflect the works of Christ
[1:08:36] but so many of us try to do the works of
[1:08:38] Christ before the reflection of Christ
[1:08:39] is in us you know back to that point
[1:08:42] about and I hate calling brother
[1:08:43] Coleman's name but everybody in the
[1:08:44] whole message know whose it is know who
[1:08:46] it is or you know where that Doctrine
[1:08:48] came from but I don't think he was
[1:08:50] trying to deceive people
[1:08:52] he was trying to do something amen
[1:08:55] everybody that has a a an angle is
[1:08:59] trying to do something they're not
[1:09:01] literally trying to deceive everybody
[1:09:03] they're trying to know this new
[1:09:05] something
[1:09:06] this new doctrine this new way and you
[1:09:09] got to come listen to me we'll see you
[1:09:10] Bear right there when somebody says you
[1:09:12] got to come listen to me get away
[1:09:15] but so many of us trying to do the works
[1:09:17] of Christ before the refraction of
[1:09:19] Christ is in US
[1:09:20] I believe the seven thunder sound
[1:09:23] the Bible said they sounded
[1:09:26] but it's not seven men I gotta listen to
[1:09:29] for them to sound
[1:09:33] we'd be in trouble because they're all
[1:09:35] gone
[1:09:36] now brother Brown said now there's the
[1:09:38] trouble we find those things happening
[1:09:40] you know it I know it we see stumbles
[1:09:42] along the road scrap people of what
[1:09:43] ministers
[1:09:45] most doctrines do not start
[1:09:48] in the congregation
[1:09:51] sad to say they start behind the
[1:09:52] pulpeper
[1:09:55] amen
[1:09:57] we see these stumbles along the road
[1:09:59] scrap heaps of Ministers of Christians
[1:10:01] now he's not talking about
[1:10:03] he's not talking about re you know
[1:10:06] regenerated unregenerated people he's
[1:10:08] talking about Christians
[1:10:11] piled along the road is because they
[1:10:13] don't go into it right
[1:10:17] because there was somebody that
[1:10:20] that brought brother Dale a message one
[1:10:22] time
[1:10:24] right maybe even two people I know one
[1:10:27] for sure not gonna call his name
[1:10:29] and tried to get him to come into that
[1:10:34] the brother that went into it right they
[1:10:36] didn't
[1:10:40] he said hey wait a minute
[1:10:42] and he studied it out
[1:10:44] and when he studied it out
[1:10:47] he saw that that Minister was in the
[1:10:49] scrap Heap
[1:10:50] and you know what he proved he's in the
[1:10:52] scrap Heap because that's where he ended
[1:10:53] up
[1:10:54] in Scrappy right Pop I mean I'm not
[1:10:56] telling a story about my y'all don't
[1:10:58] know who it is so
[1:11:01] piled up along the road not that there
[1:11:03] not that they're you know horrible
[1:11:05] people but it's just they went out past
[1:11:08] God's program you and I don't need to go
[1:11:10] out past God's program stay in the
[1:11:13] program that we're in
[1:11:15] if you're not at patience Pray For What
[1:11:19] patience
[1:11:25] that's why this weekend coming up you
[1:11:27] know let's make this a refreshal not
[1:11:29] just something it's just not a good idea
[1:11:31] I came up with okay
[1:11:33] I've been mulling it over for for a
[1:11:35] little while and and some had said
[1:11:37] they'd like to be re-baptizing and I
[1:11:40] thought when then someone to renew their
[1:11:42] vows so I just thought we'd do all that
[1:11:44] together but let's make that as a
[1:11:46] renewing of of reconcili reconciliation
[1:11:49] I'm gonna read it before we close I'll
[1:11:51] get done I'm going to skip through all
[1:11:52] this I can get to it Sunday
[1:11:55] how that we he's trying to teach this
[1:11:57] little church and myself how to take it
[1:11:58] become the dwelling place
[1:12:01] of the Living God how many he'd like to
[1:12:03] be that
[1:12:06] you know you know what some people are
[1:12:08] scared to be that
[1:12:11] some people are scared to be the
[1:12:13] dwelling place of God
[1:12:16] because they don't have God inside of
[1:12:17] them
[1:12:18] if you've got God inside of you you want
[1:12:20] to be like God
[1:12:23] because there's a call
[1:12:25] coming from inside not from the outside
[1:12:27] coming from inside
[1:12:30] patience with what patience with God let
[1:12:32] me get on through I'll read this and
[1:12:34] then we'll close
[1:12:37] I've read this many times he that
[1:12:38] endures to the end shall be saved we
[1:12:41] don't know
[1:12:42] who's going to make it and who's not
[1:12:46] remember the old saying you look around
[1:12:47] in heaven and you say what do they talk
[1:12:49] what are they giggling about he said
[1:12:51] well guy walked over there and he said
[1:12:53] well they're giggling because they
[1:12:54] didn't think he was going to make it
[1:12:57] and that guy said well I was wondering
[1:12:59] why that how they made it so don't worry
[1:13:01] about that worry about ourself
[1:13:04] that we endure to the end
[1:13:07] the end is what the end of the end of
[1:13:10] our like the seventh seals the end of
[1:13:12] all things it's the end of the
[1:13:14] struggling world it's the end of all
[1:13:15] this sin and all this debauchery and all
[1:13:17] this all this world Cosmos order it will
[1:13:20] end
[1:13:22] and what will end
[1:13:24] um us will be the beginning of the
[1:13:26] Eternal part
[1:13:27] sure we live part of it inside of us but
[1:13:29] I promise you you don't feel very
[1:13:31] Eternal every once in a while
[1:13:33] once in the morning and while in the
[1:13:35] afternoon every day that ends in y
[1:13:39] and I guess I'm the only one
[1:13:44] sometimes it feels like you're preaching
[1:13:45] to yourself
[1:13:48] without controversy great is the mystery
[1:13:50] of godliness what is godliness brother
[1:13:52] around to be like God
[1:13:54] so let's skip to this a little bit he
[1:13:56] said be there for perfect
[1:13:59] you got to have the nature of God
[1:14:02] we got to have a Doctrine according to
[1:14:04] Godliness we'll get to that next Sunday
[1:14:06] but I want to read this down here
[1:14:07] godliness with contentment is great gain
[1:14:09] let's keep going
[1:14:14] then that way we can close and then I'll
[1:14:16] I'll do this we can do this next
[1:14:20] don't look at that it'll make you sick
[1:14:27] let's read a start right here
[1:14:30] just for a minute it's only 8 24. oh you
[1:14:33] sons of man how long will you turn my
[1:14:35] glory into shame Psalms 4 verse 2. how
[1:14:38] long will you love vanity and seek after
[1:14:40] leasing Selah
[1:14:42] but know that the Lord hath set apart
[1:14:45] him that is Godly
[1:14:47] for himself
[1:14:50] remember brother Brown said God was a
[1:14:52] segregationist we don't
[1:14:54] we want the whole world to be saved and
[1:14:57] God does too but he knows who will and
[1:14:59] who won't you and I don't that's why we
[1:15:02] keep preaching that's why we keep
[1:15:03] exhorting we keep we keep trying to pull
[1:15:06] people
[1:15:07] pull them in
[1:15:11] I promise you one thing most of y'all
[1:15:13] sitting here looking at me today I know
[1:15:15] when knowledge was Worthy
[1:15:18] of being saved
[1:15:21] none of us
[1:15:24] no I guarantee you I want anybody the
[1:15:26] rest of you may be but I'm not
[1:15:29] but know that the Lord has set apart him
[1:15:31] that is Godly for himself
[1:15:33] and the Lord will hear when I call unto
[1:15:36] him so there's a direct link to him
[1:15:39] standing awe and sin not
[1:15:42] commune with your own heart upon your
[1:15:44] bed and be still in other words be
[1:15:46] patient offer the sacrifice of
[1:15:48] righteousness and put your trust in the
[1:15:50] Lord
[1:15:51] Psalms 32 and here's David I acknowledge
[1:15:55] my sin unto them my iniquity have I not
[1:15:57] hid I said I will confess my
[1:16:00] transgressions unto the Lord and thou
[1:16:02] forgavest the iniquity of my sin
[1:16:06] Sheila
[1:16:08] for this shall everyone that is Godly
[1:16:10] pray unto thee in a time when thou
[1:16:14] mayest be found
[1:16:16] surely in the floods of Great Waters
[1:16:18] they shall not come nigh
[1:16:21] unto him Thou Art my Hiding Place
[1:16:25] Thou shalt preserve me from trouble
[1:16:28] Thou shalt Compass me about with songs
[1:16:32] of Deliverance
[1:16:33] Salah here's the point of one of Maine
[1:16:36] we'll stop right here second Corinthians
[1:16:38] 5. therefore If any man be in Christ
[1:16:40] what he is a new creature
[1:16:42] all things are passed away behold all
[1:16:44] things are become new and all things are
[1:16:48] of God who hath reconciled us to himself
[1:16:51] what does reconcile mean
[1:16:54] repair a relationship
[1:16:56] or to bring back together something that
[1:17:00] had been pulled apart
[1:17:02] there's only one man that can reconcile
[1:17:04] us back to Christ and that was Christ
[1:17:09] listen Adam tried it
[1:17:12] he couldn't do it
[1:17:14] he sinned
[1:17:17] and all things are of God who hath
[1:17:18] reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ
[1:17:21] and hath given to us a Ministry
[1:17:25] a Reconciliation a Ministry that will
[1:17:28] bring us back that'll make us number one
[1:17:31] realize we were lost realize we were
[1:17:34] separated from God realize at what point
[1:17:38] we're not in the economy of God
[1:17:41] but it had a part
[1:17:46] by foreknowing that you would one day
[1:17:50] say I've had enough
[1:17:52] I'm sick and tired of being sick and
[1:17:54] tired
[1:17:55] so then if he did that brother John he
[1:17:58] had to give us a Ministry to get us back
[1:18:01] he had to give up some Ministry of
[1:18:03] reconciliation that now we can be
[1:18:05] reconciled back to back to Christ
[1:18:08] to it that God was in Christ look
[1:18:10] reconciling the whole world
[1:18:14] the whole world
[1:18:16] but not everybody's going to accept it
[1:18:17] not imputing their trespasses
[1:18:20] unto them wow
[1:18:23] and hath committed us unto the word
[1:18:26] of reconciliation
[1:18:29] so there's a Ministry and there's a word
[1:18:31] to go with it
[1:18:33] now then we are ambassadors for Christ
[1:18:37] as though God did beseech You by us we
[1:18:40] pray you in Christ stead be reconciled
[1:18:43] to God
[1:18:43] for he hath made him to be sin for us
[1:18:46] who knew no sin that we might be made
[1:18:51] the righteousness of God in him
[1:18:55] that we might be made the righteousness
[1:18:59] of God
[1:19:00] in him and that's that word Godly
[1:19:04] but we got to read this before we close
[1:19:07] musicians come everybody stand all that
[1:19:10] live guardly in Christ Jesus shall
[1:19:13] suffer
[1:19:14] persecution
[1:19:17] you'll be hated
[1:19:21] by your own brother sometimes
[1:19:26] but evil men and seducers shall wax
[1:19:28] worse and worse deceiving
[1:19:31] and being deceived
[1:19:34] we'll get to the rest of it we haven't
[1:19:35] even got down was trying to get to uh
[1:19:38] blessed is a man that walketh not in the
[1:19:40] council
[1:19:42] of the ungodly nor standeth in the way
[1:19:45] of Sinners nor sitteth in the seat of
[1:19:46] the scornful but his Delight is in the
[1:19:49] law of the Lord and in his law doth he
[1:19:51] meditate
[1:19:53] day and night
[1:19:55] and here's your promise and he shall be
[1:19:57] like a tree planted by the rivers of
[1:20:00] water that bringeth forth his fruit in
[1:20:03] his season his Leaf also shall not
[1:20:05] wither him whatsoever he doeth shall
[1:20:08] prosper wow the ungodly are not so
[1:20:11] there's your separation
[1:20:13] the ungodly or not so but are like the
[1:20:16] chaff which the Wind Drive with the way
[1:20:18] therefore the ungodly shall not stand in
[1:20:21] the Judgment you say well now hold on a
[1:20:22] man
[1:20:24] hold on
[1:20:26] what judgment is he talking about
[1:20:28] remember
[1:20:30] there's part of you that's being judged
[1:20:32] here everybody's being judged on the
[1:20:34] earth some have got to go to the white
[1:20:36] Throne we don't we go for a judgment of
[1:20:39] the Deeds Done in the body but let's
[1:20:42] don't read into that that the ungodly
[1:20:43] will not stand judgment they're going to
[1:20:45] be judged they're being judged now but
[1:20:49] they're going to have to give the
[1:20:50] account when they get there
[1:20:52] not the center in the congregation of
[1:20:54] the righteous for the Lord knoweth the
[1:20:55] way of the righteous
[1:20:57] but the way of the ungodly Shall Perish
[1:21:01] let's don't be ungodly
[1:21:03] but if you live ungodly you may have
[1:21:06] just a real happy life because the
[1:21:08] devil's got you
[1:21:09] but if you live Godly in Christ you're
[1:21:12] going to suffer because this thing right

[1:21:25] realm being reconciled but this was born
