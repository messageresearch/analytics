[0:01] good afternoon i just want to give a
[0:03] brief testimony of how god's worked in
[0:05] my life
[0:08] and
[0:08] brother benny i want you know i'm
[0:09] praying for you
[0:11] amen
[0:12] i found out a long time ago through
[0:14] sickness at different things that we go
[0:16] through that don't go up and tell
[0:17] somebody you know how they feel when you
[0:19] haven't experienced what they've
[0:20] experienced
[0:21] you know until you can you've been there
[0:24] and done that trust me
[0:26] you're more death makes you more
[0:28] desperate to perform when when you've
[0:30] experienced it amen but i'm just praying
[0:32] for everyone
[0:34] uh i just wanted to give you a brief
[0:36] update what's happened i found out just
[0:38] recently
[0:39] that the lord decided i needed about
[0:41] seven weeks down time
[0:44] this is what was revealed to me while i
[0:46] was
[0:48] lost my job
[0:49] but it all goes back to the faith you
[0:51] know hebrews 1 and faith is the
[0:53] substance of things hoped for and
[0:55] evidence of things not seen
[0:57] you know an ice storm come through here
[0:59] the other a couple weeks ago
[1:01] had i been working i could not have been
[1:03] at home helping
[1:05] howl and popping them get the things
[1:08] done that had to be done power poles
[1:10] were broken down we were digging post
[1:12] holes and setting telephone poles
[1:14] cutting them around dragging telephone
[1:16] poles but had i been on the job i could
[1:18] have been doing those things to help
[1:21] and i've decided
[1:24] that
[1:26] i learned what happened you know the
[1:27] lord gave me this job anyway that i had
[1:29] down in buford it was in the glass
[1:31] business but i've always been in the
[1:32] heavy metal stamping business and i feel
[1:34] like a bull in the china shops what i've
[1:36] always thought
[1:37] but the bottom line is i i stood there
[1:40] and took a man's word for six years that
[1:42] you'll never leave me you won't quit me
[1:44] with he would tell me this every week
[1:47] don't leave me don't ever quit
[1:49] and uh so i took him at his word he said
[1:52] it so much i finally got frustrated one
[1:53] day and i said do you want me to quit
[1:55] because i began to not believe it
[1:58] so i put my faith in a man and that's
[1:59] where i went wrong
[2:03] so
[2:04] january 30th i felt like a cowboy been
[2:06] in the fight i knocked out the door down
[2:08] on the ground and dusted so i got up and
[2:10] dusted myself off and i said you know
[2:12] what i'm a christian
[2:14] i'm going to go on
[2:16] but
[2:17] one thing happened to me that i think
[2:20] was also part of this i have uh
[2:22] struggled with temperance as
[2:24] many know unfortunately
[2:26] but the lord showed me what that was
[2:31] it was about my father
[2:33] my earthly father
[2:35] how hard he was
[2:36] and how
[2:38] when he died he didn't tell me he was
[2:40] sick i would see him a lot and he left
[2:42] me for about
[2:44] a month or you know about six months and
[2:47] but he never told me he was sick or
[2:49] anything and he had brain cancer
[2:51] and i was i found out the lord showed me
[2:53] you were mad because he didn't tell you
[2:55] the truth
[2:57] and that's what my temperance is all
[2:58] about that's what the lord showed me
[3:04] so i'm through that
[3:09] i'm going to do better
[3:12] but had it not been for this down time
[3:15] i would have not been able to you know i
[3:17] felt like i was letting my family down
[3:21] but
[3:21] something came to me and james you lust
[3:23] and you have
[3:24] not you kill and you desire to have and
[3:27] cannot obtain you fight in war yet you
[3:30] have not because you asked not
[3:33] so i began to pray as i looked for a job
[3:36] every week going on the internet
[3:38] different things and i began to pray
[3:40] and it came to me said lord pray this
[3:42] way if it be your will
[3:46] and that's what i began to pray
[3:48] i said lord be your will you'll find me
[3:50] a job
[3:53] but during this time
[3:55] we have paid off while i was not working
[3:57] we were paid off two credit cards
[4:01] the lord just did work that out some way
[4:04] so we paid off two credit cards and
[4:06] we've done a lot of things and been
[4:08] through a lot of things together but i
[4:09] always
[4:10] i said
[4:11] someday lord's going to give me a way to
[4:12] be with my wife that's my friend
[4:16] he gave me that time
[4:17] for seven weeks
[4:19] but he showed me a way that i could just
[4:21] still
[4:22] be with her and not work
[4:25] that sounds crazy but i got enough faith
[4:27] to believe
[4:28] that
[4:30] had this not i've got a job effective
[4:32] last tuesday
[4:34] had i not got that job that i was
[4:36] already had my mind made up i had a way
[4:38] to make it that i was going to be at
[4:40] home because i was put there for a
[4:41] purpose to help and serve
[4:43] whatever needed around the house
[4:47] but i just want to say this
[4:49] the fact is that
[4:52] until i started asking him
[4:55] i wasn't ready i had a lot of things
[4:56] going on but i finally stopped i said
[4:58] lord if it be your will it's time for me
[5:01] to go to work
[5:02] i had just finished a remodel for pop
[5:04] and then on a mobile home i just
[5:06] finished everything i had to finish
[5:07] complete
[5:09] right there and that next day i got a
[5:11] job and that's god that's all i did
[5:14] so
[5:15] and i never thought that i could get a
[5:17] job better than the last job i had i
[5:19] made more money i ever made my life but
[5:21] it ain't about money
[5:23] not that's really my problem is
[5:26] what it can do and get you into
[5:28] but the problem is uh the fact is that
[5:32] i didn't i wasn't doubting that god
[5:34] couldn't give me something better
[5:37] i would i was just
[5:38] wouldn't believe it
[5:40] well the job i got today
[5:42] on last tuesday i started a job with
[5:44] price industries and the position he put
[5:46] me in is like number two in the plant
[5:49] with under the plant manager which takes
[5:51] a four to six year degree in engineering
[5:54] over uh tool and die and maintenance and
[5:56] that's what i've done all my life but i
[5:57] don't have
[5:58] anything but a high school degree so
[6:00] that's god that did that in my
[6:02] experience
[6:03] but most of all it's the prayers of the
[6:05] saints believing you know sister peggy
[6:08] would say oh here we got to go again we
[6:09] got to pray for brother boy but
[6:12] but this is a journey
[6:14] i'm convinced that it's nothing but a
[6:15] journey
[6:16] that's going to build character this new
[6:18] plant manager within 15 minutes he and i
[6:20] sat down and he was interviewing me and
[6:22] he said i see character
[6:25] and he started talking about the lord
[6:27] how many times where can you go to a job
[6:29] in a plan or somewhere and the lord
[6:31] comes up
[6:33] it doesn't happen unless
[6:35] something
[6:36] makes it happen and that's who does it
[6:38] he makes it happen but i just want to
[6:40] thank everybody for praying
[6:42] and my god is real amen amen and i've
[6:45] claimed that and faith is a substance
[6:48] and this message
[6:50] you think about this the first message
[6:52] that we are known of is faith is a
[6:54] substance right
[6:57] from that very beginning in this message
[6:59] all the way through this journey that
[7:00] i've had
[7:02] is where that's where my very foundation
[7:04] starts
[7:05] and i'm i believe
[7:08] like when my dad passed i had to
[7:10] disconnect the machine i believe if he
[7:12] had the faith to come up off that table
[7:14] he would have done that
[7:15] that's just the faith i have and i've
[7:17] told brother dale and i've been in
[7:18] surgeries
[7:19] i said i believe he'll raise me up
[7:21] brother benny you believe and i'm gonna
[7:23] believe with you
[7:24] and
[7:25] if just don't pray unless you're really
[7:27] sincere and you mean it that's all and i
[7:29] thank you so much and the lord's blessed
[7:31] me and i just uh
[7:34] i just hope and pray that
[7:38] nobody really knows what another person
[7:39] is going through
[7:41] but that doesn't mean that you don't
[7:43] need to stop praying for them
[7:44] you know just pray
[7:46] thank you i love you
[8:16] amen god bless you
[8:24] this is
[8:25] sister doris up at uh
[8:28] mckaysville she always asked me to
[8:31] to do this song
[8:33] and uh
[8:36] i think it goes
[8:37] along with what uh
[8:40] brother matthew was saying this morning
[8:43] about a song we've done in a while

[26:33] amen god bless you today let's go to
[26:34] saint john chapter seven
[26:36] i'm going to read one passage and have a
[26:38] word of prayer praise god
[26:40] we're just uh
[26:43] really happy to get to share once again
[26:44] we're just gonna have a little bible
[26:46] study have a little sunday school study
[26:48] praise god you'd like to study the bible
[26:51] amen
[26:53] down in mobile
[26:54] uh we have what's called bible thread
[26:57] it's just a like a chain we just take
[27:00] scripture and just dovetail one
[27:01] scripture next year and it kind of when
[27:04] you get the inspiration holy ghost man
[27:06] that thing just opens up a beautiful
[27:07] picture because all scripture dovetails
[27:10] it's all connected amen
[27:12] praise the lord
[27:13] so uh
[27:15] i think we'll do a little bit of that
[27:16] today good lord willing let's let's look
[27:18] at this here in chapter 7 verse 10.
[27:22] uh just one passage of scripture
[27:26] how many of you know there's secret
[27:27] things hidden in the word
[27:29] of course you would know that right
[27:31] being message folk the way you are
[27:33] all kinds of things was hidden in this
[27:35] word amen
[27:37] and the in the sweet lord jesus still
[27:39] has things that it lets people make
[27:40] discoveries about and
[27:42] find out the spoken word message still
[27:44] pertinent for the hour
[27:46] amen praise the lord all right
[27:49] and we just want to stay right there and
[27:50] let the holy ghost just bring that nice
[27:53] sweet rain
[27:54] so we can be fruitful and manifest the
[27:56] word in the hour amen
[27:59] the bible says in saint john chapter 7
[28:01] verse 10
[28:03] what's 7 plus 10
[28:05] 17 okay okay just just checking with you
[28:09] 17 is an important number these days you
[28:11] know what i mean
[28:13] in verse 10 it says but when his
[28:15] brethren were gone up
[28:18] then went he also up unto the feast
[28:22] not openly
[28:24] but as it were in secret right and the
[28:26] coming of the lord is in
[28:29] a secret coming amen
[28:31] now this feast that jesus attended
[28:35] not openly but as it were in secret
[28:38] this feast is the seventh feast
[28:41] and you find out in the book of john
[28:43] here it's actually the feast of
[28:44] tabernacles
[28:45] jesus attended the south feast in the
[28:47] sermon future home brother brahm said
[28:50] the seventh church age is a type of the
[28:52] seventh feast
[28:54] so the secret coming of the lord
[28:56] in these last days is in the
[28:58] seventh
[29:00] right right so here's a reflection of it
[29:02] right here
[29:03] amen let's pray
[29:05] precious father we love you so much lord
[29:07] god
[29:08] thank you god for opening up our hearts
[29:10] and open up our eyes and let us see the
[29:12] coming of the lord the way that it truly
[29:14] is lord we know now father that the
[29:16] coming has always been a secret way but
[29:19] you father have illuminated your bride
[29:22] jesus and you've brought into your
[29:24] presence lord that quickening power is
[29:26] living and moving in her and god we know
[29:28] that this hour is coming where the
[29:30] gentile dispensation will come to a
[29:31] close and you'll call your saints from
[29:34] the grave and those which are alive and
[29:36] remain to be changed father god and
[29:38] caught up and lord we'll all meet
[29:40] together and we'll be gathered unto you
[29:42] just like the bible says and father we
[29:44] live for that moment lord we just humbly
[29:46] bow our lives to you o god and we pray
[29:49] that whatever has to be done whatever
[29:51] has to be accomplished to make us ready
[29:53] father help us to meet that our god and
[29:55] be truly found in that place of
[29:58] fulfillment god please touch the hearts
[30:01] and lies of my dear brothers and sisters
[30:02] and myself god help us to fulfill all
[30:05] the righteousness of your word for this
[30:07] hour let us meet the directors and the
[30:09] objectives that you laid down for your
[30:11] bride for this our lord and just stir
[30:13] our hearts and help us father god to
[30:15] come into full obedience full compliance
[30:18] and under full subjection to your
[30:19] headship we love you lord jesus and we
[30:21] love your appearing and we ask that you
[30:23] help us be ready lord in jesus christ's
[30:26] name amen
[30:27] amen god bless you can be seated
[30:29] now
[30:31] uh
[30:33] we'll
[30:34] just kind of be a little casual here and
[30:37] relax a little bit
[30:40] because i want you to just kind of study
[30:42] along with me
[30:43] now you remember how
[30:46] maybe you do maybe you don't but in this
[30:48] future home brother branham was talking
[30:49] about the seventh day the millennium
[30:52] is also a type of the seventh feast
[30:55] because in the millennium we'll be
[30:56] building houses
[30:58] building
[30:59] temporary dwelling places because the
[31:01] millennium is a space of time so even
[31:04] the millennium itself is glorious as it
[31:06] is is still temporary
[31:08] amen amen
[31:10] because the millennium is reflected in
[31:12] the scripture in different places and
[31:14] the seventh feast is one of those
[31:16] reflections the feast of tabernacles
[31:19] so
[31:20] the millennium
[31:23] is like the feast of tabernacles
[31:27] well
[31:28] whenever you follow the things the
[31:30] prophet teaches
[31:32] during the feast of tabernacles moses
[31:36] the lord commanded israel through the
[31:37] prophet moses that every seventh year
[31:42] in the feast
[31:44] of tabernacles bring the book out of the
[31:46] ark of the covenant open up before the
[31:47] people and read it publicly
[31:49] so the feast of tabernacles is
[31:51] synonymous with the opening of the word
[31:54] amen
[31:55] so this last church age like unto the
[31:58] feast of tabernacles is an age where the
[32:01] word is opened up right amen
[32:04] is that right
[32:06] so you're with me then
[32:07] all right
[32:08] this is the whole bible in the book of
[32:10] nehemiah you find out whenever they
[32:12] build a pulpit of wood and take the uh
[32:15] and the pulpit of wood was built
[32:16] specifically to set the word on and have
[32:18] a public reading of the word and it was
[32:21] around the seventh feast
[32:23] in the fall of the year they was
[32:24] observing the word in a way that they
[32:26] had never observed it before since
[32:29] before the captivity
[32:31] all right so that's a reflection of this
[32:33] hour
[32:34] amen
[32:35] and uh
[32:37] we have all these great things that
[32:39] pertain to that
[32:41] that realization
[32:43] and pertaining to this hour that we live
[32:45] in amen
[32:47] so
[32:49] the secret things of god
[32:51] are sealed up in the word
[32:54] right but they've become unsealed in
[32:56] these last days
[32:58] and uh we know that we have the fullness
[33:01] of the word introduced to us right
[33:04] amen sorry brother bob but i'm pulling a
[33:07] whammy on you i got some quotes here
[33:08] that i didn't give to you
[33:11] but i want to read a couple of these
[33:12] just to get you
[33:14] in the frame of mind here
[33:17] and uh there's a man here that can turn
[33:19] on the light in 1963
[33:21] december 29
[33:22] on paragraph 156
[33:25] brother braham says but the grain goes
[33:27] right on
[33:28] and now we're in another age
[33:30] why won't they receive it
[33:32] why won't they see that the grain is
[33:34] matured
[33:37] here is the promised word for this day
[33:39] brother brown patch's bible why don't
[33:41] they see it because they're living in a
[33:44] lutheran glare
[33:46] right a wesleyan glare a baptist glare a
[33:50] pentecostal glare they're living in a
[33:52] glare of another light
[33:54] that's the reason they can't receive the
[33:56] light
[33:57] of the total word
[34:00] right
[34:01] the light of the what say that with me
[34:04] light of the total word
[34:07] being vindicated as god promised
[34:11] huh
[34:12] that's just one
[34:14] we can stack them this high if you want
[34:15] all the quotes
[34:17] the reason they can't receive the light
[34:19] of the total word being vindicated as
[34:20] god promised the seven seals were the
[34:24] what
[34:28] it's real simple
[34:30] when john the baptist introduced jesus
[34:32] messiah did he introduce half a word
[34:36] one-third
[34:37] i got the kind of idea brother samuel
[34:40] that john the baptist didn't like
[34:41] denominations
[34:43] and you know what a denomination is it's
[34:45] a fraction of a whole one-third
[34:48] one-fourth
[34:50] huh children of god ain't never
[34:52] satisfied with that right
[34:55] we want to feed on the whole word of god
[34:58] amen when john the baptist introduced
[35:01] jesus messiah he introduced the fullness
[35:04] of the word
[35:05] and we're taught that he's the same
[35:07] yesterday today and forever
[35:09] now our elijah ministry comes in these
[35:12] last days and what do you think he did
[35:15] he did the same thing
[35:17] he's introduced the fullness
[35:19] the completion amen
[35:22] now another one is it's really really
[35:24] good and it's in the seat should not be
[35:25] here with the shuck
[35:26] it's 65 january february 18th
[35:30] 1965 paragraph 101
[35:35] praise god give brother bob a little
[35:36] time there
[35:42] praise the lord i get by with him he has
[35:43] to love me anyway huh
[35:46] praise the lord
[35:52] notice
[35:53] and in the pentecostal age
[35:56] through the lutheran age through the
[35:58] wesleyan age there's been the same thing
[36:01] through this pentecostal age now notice
[36:03] but at the opening of the seven seals
[36:06] revelations 10
[36:09] the full word is to be born into
[36:11] manifestation again
[36:14] the full word is to be born in
[36:15] manifestation again and vindicated by
[36:18] the spirit of god
[36:20] in the full strength as it was when he
[36:23] was here on earth
[36:24] amen amen
[36:27] see that
[36:29] in the full strength as it was when he
[36:31] was here on earth
[36:33] that's what's happened
[36:35] the fullness
[36:37] when brother brandon was on the platform
[36:38] and he'd spend an hour two hours
[36:41] showing the people the scriptural
[36:42] vindication for the hour that they're
[36:44] living in and then jesus christ himself
[36:46] almighty god will come down out of
[36:48] heaven
[36:49] come onto the platform right next to the
[36:50] prophet and then discern the thoughts of
[36:53] the people's hearts to vindicate and
[36:55] prove
[36:56] what brother brown just spent two hours
[36:58] preaching about
[37:00] amen
[37:01] that's right that's
[37:03] that's the idea
[37:05] all right brother bob here's the last
[37:06] one
[37:07] it's in things that are to be
[37:10] and this is a good one too
[37:12] paragraph 42
[37:13] it's 65
[37:15] 1205. 65-1205
[37:18] december 5th 1965.
[37:22] and paragraph 42
[37:24] now
[37:26] in saint john chapter 7 verse 10 i don't
[37:28] want you to
[37:29] lose that scripture we started with
[37:34] he says i do not think that heaven is a
[37:36] place that my mother used to tell me
[37:37] about
[37:38] i believe that the church has grown from
[37:40] that
[37:42] thank god
[37:43] to think it used to be a hundred years
[37:45] ago or two i think the old timers used
[37:47] to think that everyone that died went up
[37:48] to heaven and had a harp and set up
[37:51] there on the clouds and played a harp
[37:52] and they know that there was a place
[37:54] called heaven but if that be so all the
[37:57] musicians would have it on us
[37:59] definitely me i couldn't play nothing to
[38:01] save my life
[38:03] you just took a gun to my head said
[38:04] learn that piano or else i'd say else
[38:08] yeah
[38:09] see but it isn't that kind of a place
[38:13] it isn't playing harps at all i believe
[38:15] i don't believe the bible teaches that
[38:17] but that was a conception
[38:20] that they had
[38:22] before the fullness
[38:24] of the word come into existence
[38:27] and brother banner says
[38:29] or the opening of the seven seals
[38:32] it's the same thing
[38:33] the fullness of the word come into
[38:35] existence
[38:36] is that right
[38:38] so we've been just simply trying to lay
[38:40] out to you this weekend that it's that
[38:42] fullness that gets the bride ready and
[38:43] prepared for the rapture
[38:46] it's looking into that perfection
[38:48] that brings the bride into a rapturing
[38:50] grace a translating grace amen
[38:54] so you don't want to look at the message
[38:56] as something incomplete
[38:58] you don't want to look at the ministry
[38:59] of brother branham as something that's
[39:00] not fulfilled or complete
[39:03] it's a perfect work amen okay my
[39:06] precious brother back to identify christ
[39:08] of all ages quote number eight
[39:11] but uh let's just have a little bible
[39:13] study here real fast let's share a
[39:15] little something about the number 17.
[39:18] okay well brother branham was an ohio
[39:20] river
[39:22] boy was the year 1933 he's baptized in
[39:25] the 17th person and the pillar of fire
[39:27] comes down out of heaven it says as john
[39:30] the baptist right was sent to full run
[39:32] in the first game of christ so you got a
[39:33] message that will foreign he was
[39:35] baptized in the 17th person why not the
[39:37] eighth
[39:39] why not the first
[39:41] but the lord appeared on the 17th person
[39:44] amen
[39:46] so when brother branham starts preaching
[39:48] the seals
[39:49] it's on march 17th
[39:51] amen
[39:52] and when the cloud appears in life
[39:54] magazine it's the issue of may 17th
[39:58] and just goes on and on and on
[40:00] revelations chapter 10 verse 7
[40:04] the coming of the lord the mystery in
[40:05] revelation chapter 10 is christ
[40:07] descending out of heaven
[40:09] and verse seven but we uh uh but in the
[40:12] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[40:13] right
[40:14] and here in saint john chapter seven
[40:16] verse 10 i'm showing you it's a secret
[40:18] coming again associated with the number
[40:20] 17.
[40:22] let's go to luke chapter 8.
[40:25] luke chapter 8 and we'll just look at a
[40:27] little something here
[40:31] luke chapter 8
[40:34] and verse 17.
[40:39] i like this now this is good brother
[40:40] wade
[40:41] for
[40:42] nothing is secret
[40:44] that shall not be made manifest
[40:47] neither anything hid that shall not be
[40:50] known or come abroad
[40:52] that is if you're not asleep right right
[40:54] and lady will see you right right all
[40:57] right
[40:58] that is if you got your i sav applied if
[41:00] you got the token applied
[41:02] huh
[41:03] right there's nothing hidden verse 17. i
[41:06] think that's interesting
[41:08] right amen
[41:10] let's go to luke chapter 14.
[41:14] luke chapter 14. brother branham used
[41:17] this parable right here to show the
[41:18] three pulls of his ministry
[41:20] but let's look at luke chapter 14 verse
[41:22] 16 and 17.
[41:25] and then said he unto him a certain man
[41:28] made a great supper and bade many and
[41:30] sent his servant at what time
[41:33] you eat supper in the morning
[41:35] afternoon
[41:36] in the evening time
[41:38] that servant came in even time who do
[41:40] you think that servant is right there in
[41:41] verse 17. amen
[41:44] the first time elijah has ever spoken of
[41:46] in the whole bible is first kings
[41:48] chapter 17.
[41:50] punching elijah and about in the
[41:52] computer elijah will come up it's first
[41:54] kings chapter 17. right now all right
[41:58] there's brother branham in verse 17.
[42:00] right okay so do you think the message
[42:02] might be vindicated
[42:05] look at how people turn away from the
[42:07] message and they they find mistakes i
[42:08] find perfection right right
[42:11] that's absolutely perfect
[42:13] ain't nobody can do that but god
[42:15] amen
[42:16] there's there it is right there in verse
[42:18] 17 amen
[42:20] so of course you know luke 17 30. thus
[42:22] shall it be in the days when the son of
[42:24] man is revealed amen
[42:26] now
[42:27] we know that elijah was translated
[42:30] without death
[42:31] is that right
[42:32] and elijah is connected to the rapture
[42:36] and this elijah minister in these last
[42:38] days is connected to the rapture
[42:40] amen so in second kings chapter 2 verse
[42:44] 17 is where those men went out to go try
[42:47] to find elijah and the bible says he was
[42:49] found not
[42:51] just like enoch
[42:52] he's found not right in verse 17.
[42:55] all right
[42:57] now uh
[42:59] your rapture scripture we looked at
[43:01] earlier today is first thessalonians
[43:03] chapter 4 verse 17.
[43:05] when we which are alive and remain right
[43:07] amen
[43:09] so this is just a bible thread we're
[43:10] going through let's go to acts chapter
[43:12] 17 to see if that might hold any
[43:14] significance for us
[43:18] acts chapter 17.
[43:26] let's read verse two
[43:28] and paul as his manner was hey that's
[43:30] interesting because it says in luke
[43:32] chapter four that jesus had a mannerism
[43:34] yeah he went into the synagogue and read
[43:37] and paul must have had the same spirit
[43:39] jesus had because that was his manner
[43:43] as his manner was went into them
[43:45] and three sabbath days reason with them
[43:48] out of the scriptures
[43:49] opening
[43:52] and alleging
[43:54] that christ must need this effort so
[43:56] paul was showing them the vindicated
[43:58] word
[44:00] paul was reasoning with them out of the
[44:02] scripture
[44:03] and here we have it in chapter 17. now
[44:05] let's go to luke chapter 4
[44:07] and read where jesus is given
[44:11] the scripture as his manner was
[44:14] in luke chapter 4.
[44:20] oh verse 17.
[44:26] and there was delivered unto him the
[44:28] book of the prophet isaiah and when he
[44:30] had did what
[44:31] open the book
[44:33] the opening of the word
[44:36] amen
[44:37] now there's nothing secret
[44:39] it's all opened up
[44:41] right and there was delivered unto him
[44:43] the book of the prophet isaiah and when
[44:44] he had opened the book and brother paul
[44:46] was doing the same thing opening and
[44:48] alleging is that right
[44:50] so now remember brother brown starts
[44:52] preaching seals on march 17th god hiding
[44:54] in simplicity
[44:56] amen
[44:57] so we can just go on and on and on but
[44:59] let's just give you one more here
[45:02] let's look at uh
[45:06] john chapter 20.
[45:09] john chapter 20 just give you an idea
[45:11] how
[45:12] it could possibly be associated with the
[45:15] rapture
[45:17] you think it is
[45:18] yeah i think it is too
[45:21] i think it most definitely is
[45:24] saint john chapter 20 verse 17
[45:27] jesus says unto her
[45:29] touch
[45:30] me not for i am not yet ascended
[45:34] ascended to my father but go to my
[45:36] brethren and say unto them i ascend unto
[45:38] my father and your father to my god and
[45:40] your god amen
[45:42] amen now i'm not a date setter so don't
[45:43] nobody get 2017 in your head because
[45:46] 2015 be good enough for me
[45:49] praise god you see what i'm saying all
[45:51] right
[45:52] so don't go there
[45:54] let's let's go there sooner rather than
[45:56] later
[45:58] all right so that kind of just
[46:02] gets it started for us just a little bit
[46:03] okay
[46:04] now
[46:05] when sister
[46:07] uh hope was passing away she told
[46:10] brother branham that she was saving some
[46:11] money and hid it in a coffee can up on
[46:13] the shelf and
[46:15] she was saving money for to buy him a
[46:17] rifle and the rifle was 17
[46:20] brother branham was shot in the back of
[46:22] the legs he's in the hospital the doctor
[46:24] said your heart's only beaten 17 times a
[46:27] minute when he's in india there's 17
[46:30] different religions represented in front
[46:32] of him right so brother brown pastored
[46:34] the tabernacle 17 years while i worked
[46:36] at the psi company for 17 years
[46:39] so the number 17 is associated with the
[46:42] vindication of a prophet
[46:44] with with prophecy and perfection
[46:47] okay
[46:48] and uh we're going to look at something
[46:50] that
[46:51] you may or may not have realized i just
[46:53] realized it just a few months back the
[46:55] lord we was in brother sam's backyard
[46:57] having a little bible study we had our
[46:59] laptops open and his brother bob would
[47:01] bring up the sermons in the content list
[47:03] of 1960 i want to look at the church
[47:06] ages with you this jumps right off the
[47:08] screen at me open up your bibles of
[47:10] revelations chapter 6.
[47:13] right here i want us to look at the
[47:14] church ages
[47:16] watch how this is formatted it's exactly
[47:19] the way it is with the seals
[47:21] if you look at this it says revelation
[47:23] of jesus christ and the patmos vision
[47:25] well that's god hiding in simplicity and
[47:27] the breach
[47:29] first seal second seal third fourth
[47:32] fifth
[47:33] sixth
[47:34] and then questions and answers on the
[47:35] seals and then the seventh seal
[47:38] formatted exactly the same way
[47:41] so what you have is ten sermons
[47:44] dealing with seven church ages a ten and
[47:47] seven again
[47:49] so right
[47:51] so if you go to 1963 so they can see it
[47:54] brother bob
[47:56] here you have it right here revelation
[47:57] of jesus christ patmos vision
[48:00] ephesians sumerian right
[48:03] then pergamos thytira sardisian age
[48:07] philadelphian age
[48:09] right the 10 virgins and 144 000 then
[48:11] the seventh church age
[48:13] formatted exactly right
[48:16] that that's pretty awesome
[48:18] i got to looking at that i thought now
[48:20] lord brother branham never mentioned
[48:22] this but there it is
[48:24] so i take it over here and i read
[48:26] revelations chapter 6. guess how many
[48:28] verses are in the chapter
[48:31] 17 verses in revelation chapter six
[48:35] guess what chapter comes in between the
[48:36] sixth seal and the seventh seal
[48:39] chapter seven right
[48:41] well guess what chapter comes in between
[48:43] the sixth trumpet and the seventh
[48:44] trumpet
[48:45] chapter
[48:46] ten chapter 7 and chapter 10.
[48:51] perfect vindication
[48:53] all right let's look at let's read in
[48:55] revelations chapter 6.
[49:01] i don't know about you but i'm totally
[49:02] sold out to this message because i see
[49:04] it's absolutely right you see that
[49:05] brother amen
[49:07] it's formatted exactly the way brother
[49:09] branham did the sermons whether he was
[49:11] conscious of it or not the holy ghost
[49:13] put that together like that that's the
[49:15] way it's formatted in the bible
[49:17] now when you look at revelations chapter
[49:19] 6 you have 17 verses
[49:21] chapter 7 is that sermon between the
[49:24] sixth church age and the seventh church
[49:26] age because you have the 144 000 and the
[49:29] virgins in the same chapter
[49:33] so
[49:33] that's what interrupts the seal between
[49:36] the sixth and seventh seal
[49:39] you see now why does god do this
[49:41] obviously because he hides things it's
[49:44] hidden in the word this way
[49:46] right but then it's brought out whenever
[49:49] god wants to illuminate us to something
[49:51] that he's doing
[49:53] so
[49:54] if you go over here to the trumpets and
[49:56] look at chapter eight
[49:59] chapter eight picks up your seventh seal
[50:00] in verse one
[50:03] so chapter seven comes in between the
[50:05] sixth and seventh seal
[50:08] just like brother brandon put a sermon
[50:09] between the six and the seventh
[50:12] i love it
[50:14] so you go to the trumpets and they start
[50:16] in revelations chapter 8.
[50:18] it goes all the way to six trumpets and
[50:20] it's cut off or interrupted by chapter
[50:22] 10 which is our seventh seal
[50:25] brother branham said the seventh trumpet
[50:27] is to israel what the seventh seal is to
[50:29] the bride amen so revelations chapter 10
[50:32] is the coming of the lord to get the
[50:33] bride
[50:34] revelations chapter 7
[50:37] pastor i'm just saying put in a form of
[50:39] a question because i don't want to make
[50:40] it sound like i know what i'm talking
[50:41] about or anything
[50:42] but chapter 7 i wonder could it be the
[50:45] seventh trumpet
[50:46] because it's the coming of the seal the
[50:48] holy ghost coming to 144 000 to seal the
[50:51] 144 thousand brother branham plainly
[50:55] tells us that revelations chapter 10 is
[50:57] the seventh seal
[50:59] there's several quotes on it
[51:01] so
[51:02] you have revelations chapter 10 when you
[51:04] read to the end of the last verse or the
[51:07] sixth trumpet starts in verse 13 of
[51:09] chapter nine and then the seventh
[51:12] trumpet is over here in chapter 11.
[51:15] so chapter 10 comes in between the sixth
[51:17] and seventh trumpet
[51:20] so you see how it's formatted in the
[51:21] scripture
[51:22] that's how the sermons are formatted
[51:24] now let's go where brother branham took
[51:26] us back to matthew 24 where the seals
[51:29] are right
[51:30] all right turn to matthew 24 with me
[51:33] and we'll see how brother brown showed
[51:35] us that jesus was covering the seals
[51:37] right there
[51:38] laying them out
[51:41] you come all the way to the sixth seal
[51:43] because he breaks the chapter down for
[51:45] us and shows us from the first seal to
[51:47] the sixth seal
[51:49] so the way it's even wrote here in
[51:50] matthew 24 is exactly the way it is in
[51:52] revelations
[51:54] go to the sixth seal then it goes right
[51:55] straight to the jews
[51:57] in chapter seven
[52:00] so right here in matthew chapter 24
[52:02] jesus says immediately after the
[52:04] tribulation of those days shall the sun
[52:05] be darkened and the moon shall not give
[52:07] her light there's your sixth seal
[52:09] and the star shall fall from heaven the
[52:11] powers of heaven shall be shaken and
[52:13] then shall appear the sign of the son of
[52:14] man in heaven and then shall all the
[52:16] tribes of the earth mourn and they shall
[52:17] see the son of man coming in clouds of
[52:19] heaven with power and great glory right
[52:21] and he shall send his angels brother
[52:23] abraham says to moses and elijah
[52:26] with the great sound of the seventh
[52:28] trumpet right amen and they shall gather
[52:31] together his elected 144 thousand from
[52:34] the four winds from the end of heaven to
[52:35] the other right
[52:36] now learn a parable of the fig tree
[52:38] that's right
[52:39] so there's your revelations chapter 7
[52:42] and verse 32
[52:43] perfect order
[52:45] all right now it took a profit to open
[52:47] all this up but i mean
[52:49] it's just amazing how perfect god stays
[52:52] with his word
[52:53] all right
[52:54] now
[52:56] when you read this brother branham
[52:59] follows the example of jesus
[53:02] the lord jesus does not reveal
[53:06] the seventh seal the same way that he
[53:08] does the six seals right
[53:11] the seven seal brother branstad will be
[53:13] a total secret right
[53:15] all right
[53:16] but if you follow the rest of the
[53:18] chapter the rapture is in the rest of
[53:20] the chapter
[53:25] you understand what i'm saying because
[53:26] he it's like he throws off
[53:28] to try to hide something
[53:30] now learn a parable of a fig tree so he
[53:32] starts talking about israel
[53:34] right
[53:35] but then if you go to uh
[53:37] verse 37 and come on down like a verse
[53:41] 40. then shall two in the field one
[53:43] shall be taken to one left well there's
[53:45] the rapture
[53:47] it's right there hidden in scripture
[53:49] once you know what the seventh seal is
[53:52] right
[53:53] but then revelations chapter 25 goes to
[53:56] the virgins
[53:57] so the way it's formatted here is
[53:59] absolutely perfect the way he did it in
[54:01] the sermons amen so it's ten sermons
[54:06] dealing with seven seals
[54:08] ten sermons dealing with seven church
[54:10] ages
[54:11] that ten and seven so happens to be
[54:13] chapter seven
[54:15] that comes in between the sixth and
[54:16] seventh seal and chapter 10 that comes
[54:19] in between the sixth and seventh trumpet
[54:21] amen you think that number 17 is special
[54:24] a 10-7 must be something to it right by
[54:27] the way
[54:28] amen
[54:29] let's go to our quote and identify
[54:31] christ of all ages
[54:34] and we'll just
[54:36] get into something here you appreciate
[54:38] that i know i sure did
[54:42] the reason why i shared that with you
[54:43] today is you just simply underscore the
[54:45] fact that a message is absolutely
[54:47] vindicated
[54:48] don't never let no intellectual spirit
[54:50] come upon you and try to get you to
[54:52] second guesses message it is perfect
[54:55] just you gotta let the inspiration of
[54:57] the lord strike your life
[54:59] amen
[55:01] so that's why it's important to stay
[55:03] with it and study meditate pray look at
[55:05] it
[55:06] let me tell you exactly how i discovered
[55:08] that
[55:10] when i realized that a lot of people
[55:12] might have already i never did i just be
[55:14] honest with you i didn't know that until
[55:15] just a few months ago about the sermons
[55:17] of the church ages are formatted exactly
[55:19] like the sermons or the seals and then
[55:21] you take it to revelations chapter 7
[55:23] revelation chapter 10 it's the same way
[55:26] so let me tell you i'm at my
[55:28] brother-in-law's house and we're sitting
[55:30] around having bible study
[55:32] we open up our computer and i got the
[55:34] contents page of the table opened up
[55:35] just like we opened up right there and
[55:37] i'm looking over because i have been
[55:39] looking at the seals god hiding in
[55:41] simplicity in the breach right two
[55:43] sermons in one day and then monday
[55:46] morning the first angel comes to brother
[55:47] brandon gives them the mystery of the
[55:48] first seal
[55:50] that's the 18th then on the 19th tuesday
[55:52] morning the second angel comes give him
[55:54] the mystery of the second seal for seven
[55:56] consecutive days seven angels come with
[55:59] seven messages
[56:01] and give brother branham seven mysteries
[56:03] all right
[56:04] so i'm looking and i have the 1960
[56:07] sermons popped open and dropped down and
[56:09] i see the church ages and i said oh my
[56:11] god it jumped right off the screen and
[56:13] said look at that there's ten sermons
[56:16] dealing with seven church ages
[56:19] never seen that before
[56:20] and i don't recall brother brown to even
[56:22] mention it he just did it like that and
[56:24] when you look at the way they're
[56:25] preached the first two sermons is in one
[56:27] day then he takes one day to do the
[56:29] ephesian church age next day to do the
[56:31] second church age all the way to the
[56:33] last day he has two sermons again in the
[56:36] last day
[56:37] exactly the same way
[56:40] pretty amazing to me
[56:42] praise god amen so uh are you following
[56:44] a vindicated message are you satisfied
[56:47] of that
[56:48] amen we gotta just stay with it amen
[56:50] praise god
[56:51] amen
[56:52] so
[56:53] we know that god interprets his word by
[56:57] bringing it to pass
[56:59] god shows us his word
[57:02] we receive it and we never doubt it
[57:05] because the word lives the word comes to
[57:08] pass
[57:09] so brother bran makes a statement here
[57:10] very awesome he says jesus in his a in
[57:13] his age what was he just like the
[57:15] prophets of their age each one of them
[57:18] was god's word being interpreted for
[57:20] that age
[57:22] amen so the end time brides the same
[57:24] thing
[57:25] because the bride is in the word
[57:27] right
[57:29] so moses was god's word interpreted
[57:31] right
[57:32] if moses was god's word interpreted
[57:34] brother branham was god's word
[57:35] interpreted amen
[57:37] so god said i'll send down there and
[57:39] i'll deliver them i'm sending you down
[57:41] with my word i'll go
[57:43] i'll do great signs and wonders and he
[57:45] did it mary she was god's word
[57:48] interpreted
[57:49] a virgin shall conceive
[57:51] amen what if i behold i send them to you
[57:54] elijah
[57:55] you are god's word interpreted
[57:58] we work you are alive and remain
[58:01] we're alive and we remain
[58:03] amen
[58:04] amen amen
[58:05] a virgin shall conceive that was god's
[58:07] word interpreted now here comes jesus on
[58:09] the scene the god of the prophets and
[58:12] here they were so organized and
[58:13] incriminated you know in such a
[58:15] condition until they couldn't even they
[58:17] didn't even recognize him they didn't
[58:19] come or he didn't come the way they
[58:22] thought he ought to come
[58:24] they thought god would pull a little
[58:25] lever here and let the corridors of
[58:27] heaven down and he will walk out and say
[58:29] kev is this high priest of god i've
[58:30] arrived
[58:32] he had a little baby born in a manger
[58:36] now let's be careful here because the
[58:37] way jesus came was exactly the way the
[58:40] scripture said he would come right but
[58:42] that's not the way they had it figured
[58:44] in their mind
[58:46] as it was since that's the way it is now
[58:49] people follow the letter instead of
[58:51] getting a revelation so they get things
[58:53] fixed up they get doctrines ideas
[58:57] amen
[58:59] the important thing is is to follow the
[59:00] continuity and the unfolding of god's
[59:02] word
[59:03] he had a baby born in a manger down a
[59:06] little cave stable in bethlehem way down
[59:08] there with a straw and a manure of the
[59:10] barn a little baby wrapped in swelling
[59:12] cloth and laid into a manger had no
[59:14] schooling watch how they corrected the
[59:17] word as he was the word see he is the
[59:19] word he ever remains the same yesterday
[59:21] saying forever amen
[59:23] amen
[59:24] now let's go to quote
[59:26] number nine brother bob
[59:28] praise the lord
[59:31] so remember our lesson the other night
[59:33] about the gathering place
[59:35] you remember these sermons like uh like
[59:38] this one christ identif the identified
[59:40] christ of all ages god's only provided
[59:42] place of worship god's chosen place of
[59:45] worship
[59:46] these are the sermons where god brother
[59:48] brahm takes his text in deuteronomy 16
[59:51] where the lord tells israel that you
[59:53] will shall not offer your sacrifice in
[59:57] any gate
[59:58] but in the gate that i choose to place
[1:00:01] my name
[1:00:02] which is a type of jesus christ because
[1:00:04] that's where god placed his name
[1:00:06] so the only place god will ever accept
[1:00:08] worship is in christ
[1:00:11] but there's a little understanding that
[1:00:13] comes along with this because jesus
[1:00:15] christ is the same message today today
[1:00:16] forever
[1:00:17] so what he was then he is now
[1:00:21] so what was he then
[1:00:23] he was the word
[1:00:25] made manifest the interpretation of the
[1:00:28] word for that day
[1:00:30] so the word made manifest for this day
[1:00:33] is jesus christ and that's where god has
[1:00:36] placed his name
[1:00:38] all right
[1:00:39] you got that understanding
[1:00:41] okay
[1:00:42] let's go on just a few more quotes he
[1:00:44] says now and christ identified quote
[1:00:46] number nine all right
[1:00:48] now when moses come he could not have
[1:00:50] took noah's message neither could moses
[1:00:52] have
[1:00:53] took
[1:00:54] noah took moses messes neither could
[1:00:56] joshua have took any of their message
[1:00:58] see each one
[1:01:00] isaiah could not have took another's
[1:01:01] each message for that age now this is a
[1:01:04] principle you ain't taught nowhere else
[1:01:06] but this message god's word has to be
[1:01:08] applied in the age he predestinated to
[1:01:10] be applied to
[1:01:12] we're not following a historical christ
[1:01:14] we're following a living christ
[1:01:16] anointing of this hour the manifestation
[1:01:18] of the word for this day
[1:01:20] that's the difference
[1:01:22] that's the difference between cain and
[1:01:24] abel
[1:01:25] uh-huh right
[1:01:28] and with the age that we're living in
[1:01:31] when that word is interpreted
[1:01:33] god's speaking that word out and making
[1:01:36] the word for that age live
[1:01:38] given the interpretation of it that is
[1:01:41] god in christ manifesting glory right
[1:01:45] okay let me go slow because i want to
[1:01:47] just conceptualize it's the hour to
[1:01:50] conceive
[1:01:51] all right isn't it interesting how the
[1:01:53] word conceived applies to the mind in
[1:01:54] the physical womb
[1:01:56] because your mind's a spiritual wound
[1:01:58] conception
[1:02:00] this is an hour that the bride is to
[1:02:01] conceive conceptualize god's word
[1:02:05] and with the age that we're living in
[1:02:09] when that word is interpreted
[1:02:11] god's speaking that word out and making
[1:02:14] that word for that age live
[1:02:18] giving the interpretation of it that is
[1:02:20] god in christ
[1:02:22] manifesting
[1:02:25] now this is an extremely important truth
[1:02:27] and principle because that is where god
[1:02:29] puts his name the name of god is
[1:02:32] associated with the manifestation of the
[1:02:34] word all right that's a quote we're
[1:02:36] going to read it
[1:02:37] okay
[1:02:39] so now this is it we're actually i'm
[1:02:41] just kind of setting you up and building
[1:02:42] you up to something right
[1:02:44] now and god's provided place of worship
[1:02:47] quote number 10
[1:02:49] god had a certain place that he met
[1:02:52] abraham
[1:02:54] oh
[1:02:55] let's go slow
[1:02:57] god had a certain place
[1:03:00] that he met abraham and abraham
[1:03:02] worshipped
[1:03:04] all down through the testament
[1:03:06] and his promised word will be
[1:03:09] interpreted in you by him amen did you
[1:03:12] get that the word that he promised to
[1:03:15] fulfill
[1:03:16] in the day that you're living in you
[1:03:18] will be a written epistle of god
[1:03:21] read of all man
[1:03:23] not what you claim but what god does
[1:03:26] through you
[1:03:28] will speak out louder than anything you
[1:03:31] could claim
[1:03:32] that's right
[1:03:34] now i want to emphasize something here
[1:03:36] where it says god had a certain place
[1:03:40] that he met
[1:03:41] abraham
[1:03:42] right
[1:03:43] now we all know now under the new
[1:03:45] testament revelation god's meeting place
[1:03:48] is in christ
[1:03:50] and we was trying to share with you
[1:03:51] earlier today to to understand that
[1:03:53] you're in christ is awesome well and
[1:03:56] good but what part of christ
[1:03:59] because christ has been being revealed
[1:04:01] right but his fullness has been revealed
[1:04:03] in these last days
[1:04:04] so you're revealed in christ your your
[1:04:07] revelation your part in the word
[1:04:10] has certain specific meaning
[1:04:13] to the hour that you live in
[1:04:15] okay these things shall follow them that
[1:04:17] believe that speaks through you right he
[1:04:19] spoke of this age what would be now the
[1:04:22] believers of this age has to believe
[1:04:24] this right
[1:04:26] what he promised
[1:04:28] today
[1:04:30] exactly that's why i preach a lot about
[1:04:32] rapturing faith because that's the hour
[1:04:34] we're living in
[1:04:36] it you know the water age done past the
[1:04:38] blood aged unpassed the holy ghost aged
[1:04:41] unpassed
[1:04:42] the adoption that's why the statute of
[1:04:44] perfect man's taught so much in this
[1:04:46] church
[1:04:47] and everything it's the time of that
[1:04:48] perfection
[1:04:50] okay just the same as they had to come
[1:04:53] into the ark and that's so also about
[1:04:54] god right in the middle of satan's eden
[1:04:56] he's bringing a bride to perfection
[1:04:58] that's almighty god now
[1:05:00] praise god hallelujah that's good
[1:05:03] see just the same as they had to come
[1:05:05] into the ark to be saved to go out of
[1:05:06] egypt to be saved they had to come into
[1:05:08] christ to be saved now
[1:05:11] oh
[1:05:12] into the word message
[1:05:14] that he's the same yesterday today and
[1:05:16] forever
[1:05:18] now brother branham hold on a second
[1:05:20] don't don't you mean everybody is
[1:05:23] included no he just excluded a bunch of
[1:05:25] people right there
[1:05:27] think about what he's saying
[1:05:29] right a lot of people want to follow
[1:05:31] christianity as a historical context
[1:05:34] you can't right christianity's something
[1:05:36] that's living
[1:05:38] glory see to be saved now into the word
[1:05:40] message
[1:05:42] of today right
[1:05:43] right now how do you get into it by
[1:05:45] baptism baptism of what water by the
[1:05:48] holy ghost one spirit we're all baptized
[1:05:50] into one body
[1:05:51] so the holy ghost in every age is going
[1:05:53] to baptize the believer into a certain
[1:05:55] part
[1:05:56] of christ
[1:05:58] certain measures certain part right
[1:06:01] okay quote number 11.
[1:06:05] all right
[1:06:06] now
[1:06:07] does god have a meeting place
[1:06:10] did god meet with brother branham
[1:06:12] did god meet with moses
[1:06:15] moses would come into the ark and the
[1:06:17] pillar fire would come down out of
[1:06:18] heaven and meet with his prophet in the
[1:06:20] holy place
[1:06:22] and the holy place was always
[1:06:24] where the ark was
[1:06:26] and the ark was always a type and a
[1:06:28] symbol of jesus christ
[1:06:30] remember the ark was made out of wood
[1:06:32] overlaid with gold that's the wood is
[1:06:35] flesh and the gold is deity
[1:06:37] so the wood and the gold together is a
[1:06:39] is a symbol of humanity and god united
[1:06:43] jesus christ was man jesus christ was
[1:06:46] god
[1:06:47] there's the ark
[1:06:48] amen so the presence of god was always
[1:06:50] associated with that ark but the prophet
[1:06:53] was always called into that presence and
[1:06:55] given the word amen
[1:06:57] so
[1:06:58] you have a meeting place that god was
[1:07:02] always foreshadowing down to the old
[1:07:04] testament
[1:07:05] but it was always a type of god meeting
[1:07:07] man in christ
[1:07:09] the meeting place that god has
[1:07:12] with his prophets or anybody else is in
[1:07:15] christ
[1:07:17] all right
[1:07:18] we just want to relax and think these
[1:07:20] thoughts
[1:07:21] okay
[1:07:22] but we must find where he did put his
[1:07:25] name right
[1:07:26] for in it is his only provided gate amen
[1:07:31] straight is the gate and narrow is the
[1:07:33] way and few there be that find it
[1:07:36] amen glory watch where did he put his
[1:07:38] name in his son
[1:07:41] now who is the son he's the word made
[1:07:44] manifest in the age that it's manifested
[1:07:46] in
[1:07:48] oh you say now wait a minute brother
[1:07:49] branham that was the son not the father
[1:07:51] the son always takes the name of the
[1:07:53] father in every case i come to this
[1:07:55] search in the name of brandon because my
[1:07:56] father's name was branham right right
[1:07:58] jesus said i came in my father's name
[1:08:00] and received me not you want the
[1:08:02] scripture on that saint john 5 43 all
[1:08:04] right i came in my father's name and you
[1:08:05] received me not then the father put his
[1:08:07] own name which is jesus in the son
[1:08:11] and he's the way he's the door he's the
[1:08:13] house
[1:08:15] he's where god chose to put his name
[1:08:18] god never put his name in me he never
[1:08:20] put his name in the church he put it he
[1:08:23] never put it in the methodist baptist
[1:08:24] catholic he put it in christ the
[1:08:26] anointed emmanuel
[1:08:29] now that's the revelation of all
[1:08:30] revelations that's right
[1:08:32] now
[1:08:33] but that is a principle you want to be
[1:08:35] very careful to understand and follow
[1:08:36] because god don't never deviate from
[1:08:38] that right okay
[1:08:41] now paragraph 2 14.
[1:08:43] and the name we're going to go slow on
[1:08:45] this too it's real simple but you got to
[1:08:47] let your let the holy spirit just sink
[1:08:49] it into your heart and the name is in
[1:08:52] the word
[1:08:53] right because he is the word
[1:08:56] now jesus christ is the word
[1:08:58] in the beginning saint john chapter 1
[1:09:00] and the beginning was the word and the
[1:09:02] word was with god and the word was god
[1:09:05] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[1:09:07] among us and that's where god put his
[1:09:09] name right
[1:09:10] this is what brother brahm's saying and
[1:09:12] the name is in the word
[1:09:15] because he is the word amen what is he
[1:09:18] then the word interpreted is the
[1:09:21] manifestation of the name of god amen no
[1:09:24] wonder flesh and blood has not revealed
[1:09:25] this to you but my father which is in
[1:09:27] heaven has revealed this to you who i am
[1:09:29] and upon this rock i'll build my place
[1:09:31] of worship right and the gates of hell
[1:09:34] can't shake it down amen oh living
[1:09:36] church of god stand firm foundation on
[1:09:38] jesus christ alone you can sing the song
[1:09:40] but if you're not on christ the word
[1:09:42] you're on teetering faltering sand
[1:09:45] but upon this rock christ my word amen
[1:09:48] all right
[1:09:49] let's get
[1:09:50] number 12.
[1:09:55] but he said i'll choose the place to put
[1:09:57] my name
[1:09:59] and the name was jesus
[1:10:01] and jesus is the word
[1:10:03] saint john 1 is that right that's the
[1:10:05] place of worship
[1:10:07] in christ the word i come in my father's
[1:10:10] name a lot of people think they can get
[1:10:12] the spirit without the word it's a lie
[1:10:14] all right you got to put the word first
[1:10:16] and then the spirit follows amen
[1:10:19] it's the spirit that quickens the word
[1:10:22] if you want the holy ghost find out what
[1:10:24] the word is today you'll find where the
[1:10:25] spirit of god is
[1:10:28] amen
[1:10:29] now that's the place of worship in
[1:10:31] christ the word i come in my father's
[1:10:33] name the prophet said his name shall be
[1:10:35] called emmanuel that's matthew 1 23. if
[1:10:37] you want to write down jesus jehovah the
[1:10:39] savior and the fifth verse shows that he
[1:10:42] is the door
[1:10:43] by now many other invisible proofs this
[1:10:45] gate the name and place can be proved to
[1:10:48] be there's only one place that god meets
[1:10:50] man
[1:10:52] think about it church there's only one
[1:10:54] place that god meets man to worship and
[1:10:58] that's when he's in christ
[1:11:01] all right now where do you think
[1:11:04] god met brother branham to give him the
[1:11:06] seven mysteries
[1:11:09] are you with me
[1:11:10] where was brother branham caught up
[1:11:12] to meet those seven angels and what did
[1:11:14] those seven angels form
[1:11:16] the seven angels are just the seven
[1:11:18] spirits of god in a seven-fold
[1:11:20] manifestation
[1:11:21] not seven different spirits but god's
[1:11:23] spirit manifests in a sevenfold way
[1:11:25] right so the seven angels made the head
[1:11:28] of christ
[1:11:29] right so brother brown was caught up in
[1:11:31] the consolation of seven angels which is
[1:11:34] actually the fullness of the spirit
[1:11:36] it takes the fullness of the spirit to
[1:11:37] reveal the fullness of the word so the
[1:11:40] fullness of the spirit came to the
[1:11:42] prophet to reveal and fully disclose all
[1:11:44] the mysteries
[1:11:46] so god met brother branham in christ
[1:11:49] to give him the seven mysteries
[1:11:51] is that right
[1:11:53] where does god put his name at
[1:11:55] in christ
[1:11:57] all right
[1:11:58] praise god
[1:12:00] just so you know anytime you hear me go
[1:12:01] on like this you're getting set up for
[1:12:03] something
[1:12:07] all right
[1:12:08] that's the that's when he's in christ
[1:12:10] now the question is how do we get in him
[1:12:13] now this is this may pinch just a little
[1:12:15] bit but you know like taking medicine if
[1:12:18] you don't it'd make you sick
[1:12:20] if you don't it don't do no good right
[1:12:22] amen
[1:12:23] god's only provided place of worship
[1:12:25] quote number 13.
[1:12:27] amen
[1:12:29] just put this in here
[1:12:31] now the lutherans wanted to get it one
[1:12:32] way by joining the lutheran church the
[1:12:34] methodist wanted to get it mean by
[1:12:35] shouting the pentecost is one to get in
[1:12:37] by speaking in tongues that still ain't
[1:12:39] it see no that's gifts so forth but
[1:12:42] first corinthians 12 says by one spirit
[1:12:45] spirit of god which is the life giver to
[1:12:47] the word
[1:12:48] to vindicate the seed for that season
[1:12:51] see here's the methodist age seed laying
[1:12:53] there taking the holy spirit to make
[1:12:54] that seed come to life
[1:12:56] and purify the church by signification
[1:12:58] luther didn't preach that because he
[1:13:00] didn't know it the pentecost was wanting
[1:13:02] to speak in tongues for the restoration
[1:13:03] of gifts each one declares that's it
[1:13:05] that's it but by one spirit we're all
[1:13:08] baptized into one body and that body is
[1:13:11] a family
[1:13:12] the family of god
[1:13:14] and that's the house of god
[1:13:16] that's the house of god is in the name
[1:13:19] of jesus christ and the house of god is
[1:13:21] the name of jesus christ amen the name
[1:13:25] of the lord is a mighty tower the
[1:13:26] righteous run into it and are safe
[1:13:28] now how are you going to come in by a
[1:13:30] title
[1:13:32] how's your check going to be received by
[1:13:34] saying paid to the order of reverend dr
[1:13:36] minister
[1:13:37] see
[1:13:38] you might be reverend dr minister but
[1:13:39] the name
[1:13:41] of the lord is jesus christ
[1:13:44] i have chose to put my name at the door
[1:13:46] of the house of my worship
[1:13:49] for my family will be gathered in there
[1:13:52] under the blood
[1:13:54] now i know why god had me preach on
[1:13:56] shiloh because it was a gathering place
[1:13:58] okay and it's all in continuity
[1:14:01] see like it was in egypt anything
[1:14:02] outside died and in there there's no
[1:14:05] leavened bread
[1:14:07] there's no denominational mixture
[1:14:10] in it anywhere
[1:14:11] my house my children born to my jeans
[1:14:14] amen you already hear brother i see this
[1:14:16] on tape
[1:14:17] my genes amen glory to god my genes are
[1:14:20] in them
[1:14:21] my i put my word in them i'll write them
[1:14:25] upon the tables of my of their heart
[1:14:27] see that's my family the family of the
[1:14:29] body of jesus christ amen
[1:14:32] brothers and sisters we we who
[1:14:35] get in the body if you're not in the
[1:14:36] body of christ get in the body of christ
[1:14:39] the holy ghost will baptize you in there
[1:14:40] amen
[1:14:42] because the body has already been put in
[1:14:44] the grave it's already raised from the
[1:14:46] tomb it's already descended on eye
[1:14:48] that's your position as a believer is in
[1:14:50] christ if you're in the body
[1:14:52] amen and if you're in that body the holy
[1:14:54] spirit is actively revealing to you your
[1:14:57] part of the word for this day
[1:14:59] amen
[1:15:00] that's my fam my family see the door
[1:15:02] you'll come in that's my family the
[1:15:04] family the body of jesus christ the
[1:15:06] family and this door you'll come in not
[1:15:08] methodist baptist or pentecostal but in
[1:15:11] the door where i put my name
[1:15:14] it ain't methodist god's name ain't
[1:15:15] methodist god's name ain't pentecostal
[1:15:18] god's name ain't baptist god's name
[1:15:20] ain't catholic stay out of them doors
[1:15:22] then
[1:15:23] uh oh yeah right stay out of them doors
[1:15:26] in
[1:15:27] so praise god now you understand where
[1:15:29] the name of the lord is right
[1:15:31] you understand that's god's meeting
[1:15:32] place
[1:15:34] where did god
[1:15:35] meet brother branham
[1:15:37] in christ
[1:15:38] right you say well we met him in the
[1:15:40] woods once and met him out in the desert
[1:15:43] once and met him in his house once and
[1:15:45] that's all true but the real meeting
[1:15:48] place brother bram just got done showing
[1:15:49] us is in christ
[1:15:52] that's right do you think brother
[1:15:54] branham would have been given those
[1:15:55] seven mysteries if he wasn't in christ
[1:15:57] absolutely not i mean that's kind of a
[1:15:59] silly question but i'm just trying to
[1:16:01] get your thinking wrapped around this
[1:16:03] okay so let's go to our last quote
[1:16:08] this is back in 1956.
[1:16:11] now
[1:16:12] i got that ipod playing in my living
[1:16:14] room and i'm on my way out the front
[1:16:16] door here a few months back
[1:16:18] and i hear brother brandon make this
[1:16:19] statement and it hit me like a ton of
[1:16:21] bricks
[1:16:22] i had to go back and meditate in this
[1:16:23] and this 1956 quote goes together with
[1:16:26] all this right here
[1:16:28] let's read what it says remember how the
[1:16:30] angel came to brother branham and showed
[1:16:32] him his life in the scripture he says
[1:16:34] and watch he's always scriptural
[1:16:37] he said did not our lord say when thou
[1:16:39] prayest be not like the hypocrites that
[1:16:41] like to make a show said enter into the
[1:16:43] secret closet and when you have done so
[1:16:46] close the door
[1:16:47] then pray to your father that seeth in
[1:16:49] secret and he that seeth and seeker
[1:16:50] shall reward thee openly and he said
[1:16:54] the angel
[1:16:56] he said you remember that name
[1:16:58] that time you were hunting
[1:17:01] that time that you dreamed about and i
[1:17:03] said yes
[1:17:05] and he said i'll meet you in there and
[1:17:06] this time it won't be a public show
[1:17:08] right
[1:17:10] now where's the meeting place
[1:17:13] it's in the name
[1:17:14] right there why'd the angel bring to
[1:17:16] brother browner's remembrance that dream
[1:17:18] about hunting that name
[1:17:21] is that simple or what right
[1:17:23] that's pretty simple it's so simple it's
[1:17:25] painfully simple
[1:17:28] huh let's go slow and meditate
[1:17:32] the angel's talking to brother branham
[1:17:35] the angel of the lord says to him you
[1:17:37] remember that name
[1:17:39] that time that you were hunting that
[1:17:42] time that you dreamed about
[1:17:44] he said yes and i said yes
[1:17:47] he said i'll meet you in there
[1:17:50] where's there
[1:17:52] if english if language means anything it
[1:17:55] means the name
[1:17:58] that's god's provided place of worship
[1:18:01] that's the meeting place
[1:18:03] amen
[1:18:05] so that's how simple that vision is
[1:18:13] praise be to god almighty
[1:18:15] i appreciate the word of the lord today
[1:18:17] don't you
[1:18:18] amen god's truth is so awesome and so
[1:18:21] marvelous to our hearts

[1:18:32] and every one of us and make us ready

[1:18:39] that he would have us to walk in amen
[1:18:41] amen i

[1:18:44] but that's just what i felt led to share

[1:18:48] that
[1:18:49] things the lord opens up to us you know
[1:18:51] and amen
[1:18:53] uh the seven church ages are preached
[1:18:55] this is exactly where the seven seals
[1:18:56] were right that's how it's formatted
[1:18:59] right in the scripture amen
[1:19:00] that's awesome
[1:19:02] that message is perfect

[1:25:36] sure brother random made some slips of
[1:25:39] the tongue different things that's not
[1:25:41] the message
[1:25:42] the message is the word he brought
[1:25:45] so the message is perfect
[1:25:47] there are no flaws in the message
[1:25:50] there may be flaws in the man that
[1:25:52] brought it or understand it because it
[1:25:53] was a human being
[1:25:56] yet the message itself is perfect
[1:26:00] it is the word of god
[1:26:04] it is god made manifest
[1:26:06] in you
[1:26:09] anybody else's name
[1:26:43] is
[1:27:01] i shall
[1:27:02] stand amen amen you love him amen

[1:27:10] appreciate him coming and being with us
[1:27:11] and his family and all being with us for
[1:27:13] the weekend pray that the lord would
[1:27:15] bless and be with them as they're
[1:27:17] traveling back home
[1:27:18] give them a safe journey pretty good
[1:27:20] little trip back to mobile but he always
[1:27:22] makes everything right and takes care of
[1:27:24] it
