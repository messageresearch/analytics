[0:02] and here we see though that I try to see
[0:06] the boys and being turned I saw seven
[0:08] golden count sticks and in the myth the
[0:10] seven golden candlesticks one like unto
[0:14] the Son of Man clothed with a garment
[0:16] down to the foot and Girt are covered
[0:19] about the path which is up here with a
[0:22] golden girl everybody got that
[0:24] so in symbolic form the Son of Man being
[0:28] tied to a woman he's dealing the son of
[0:30] man but his bodily form on earth is a
[0:34] female alright which is us because
[0:39] there's the bride and all this because
[0:40] he said I am my alpha now watch what he
[0:42] says I am Alpha and Omega
[0:43] welcome begin the Alpha church age
[0:46] Christ had just left because it started
[0:50] in 1853 left in 1830 so he was there in
[0:53] physical son of man form starting the
[0:55] Terr days and then down here in the in
[0:57] town now we know for sure he's not going
[0:59] to come back in physical form but he is
[1:01] so physical in a variety that River
[1:04] flows so good that we can see that we
[1:07] are an extension we're not another son
[1:10] of man we are the son of man made
[1:12] manifest on the earth as a whole he was
[1:14] one man here it's a mini membered body
[1:17] here to culminate and to and to make all
[1:20] this they're waiting on us as brother
[1:22] Dale says these people are not complete
[1:25] without us
[1:26] that's why brother Lansing God's not
[1:29] complete without you it's not that God
[1:31] is standing there was not a piece of him
[1:33] missing no he needs to be able to flow
[1:36] in his fullness he needed a Adam I don't
[1:39] with the whole man but there's no way he
[1:42] can reproduce itself zero away the way
[1:46] God wanted it done so he had to take a
[1:48] female make a female to do like what
[1:52] girl Aaron been talking about well then
[1:53] talking about couple weeks ago it took a
[1:56] female to receive seed to begin the
[1:59] progeny our protein procreation same
[2:03] time with Aaron a pickoffs 100 little
[2:04] jesus's were born within all these
[2:06] church ages there's honey
[2:08] thousands of little Jesus's that what's
[2:11] happened see it's not the loins of man's
[2:13] the Word of God spoken word is original
[2:16] see all right but this man is standing
[2:20] now there's no there is no revelation of
[2:22] the Son of Man he set for himself and in
[2:26] the end time then I got that there's no
[2:29] there was no revelation of the Son of
[2:31] Man during church ages it was the son of
[2:33] God a spirit the spirit part of God the
[2:36] Holy Ghost while you come at last night
[2:38] Michael thought that Michael that's
[2:40] Michael the Archangel which was Christ
[2:43] in a form to fight with Satan in heaven
[2:48] before he came down here and got got a
[2:50] body named Jesus okay potentially he was
[2:54] that like brother Brown said melchizedek
[2:57] become Jesus Christ what Moses saw walk
[3:01] by him in the Old Testament was the
[3:04] theophany of the man that entered the
[3:06] baby in 8 and BC set bc4 to be Jesus
[3:11] Christ God Almighty in human flesh
[3:14] everybody got that pretty pretty simple
[3:17] okay but John turns to see and he's
[3:21] heard Jesus's voice forever I mean for a
[3:23] three and a half years he heard him
[3:25] every day so he kind of knew who the
[3:26] person was but he sees him in a form
[3:30] that he's that he has a Girton has a
[3:33] girdle up here that covers his past so
[3:37] like you know you keep watching what
[3:39] brother Brown says you went on the
[3:41] shoulder means something one around the
[3:43] waist means something that's different
[3:44] when you when the judge or whoever
[3:46] walked in the court and they put a sack
[3:48] it's kind of like connector on the
[3:51] Catholic Church does and graduation
[3:54] you see these the regular people
[3:56] graduating they had just a regular but
[3:58] you see these with the red ribbon
[4:00] same way with the Catholics and same way
[4:02] with you see if somebody has a doctorate
[4:05] degree and they walk up on the stage you
[4:07] see if somebody walks up is noticing
[4:10] today the Georgia State Patrol has
[4:12] something on the in the paper and the
[4:16] captain doesn't wear the thing I feel
[4:18] like the army they have the Stars up
[4:20] here for the army they wear theirs right
[4:21] here so you can see and identify that
[4:24] this guy was a pretty high ranking
[4:27] because he had four days for Starla's
[4:29] received it those assembled to tell you
[4:33] what this person is and what position he
[4:36] has so the position that God took
[4:38] through the church ages was female
[4:40] a bride he was bringing a bride to
[4:43] fruition by becoming the Son of God
[4:47] entering into the people but they would
[4:52] all die then it would be a new group
[4:54] come then they would all died and then
[4:56] they've been new group comes and it all
[4:57] die but in the end time being the
[4:59] outsider Omega he comes in the end time
[5:04] prophet brings a message and we see
[5:06] clearly like we were talking about last
[5:08] night the Book of Revelations start
[5:12] talking to a nominal person about the
[5:14] book of Revelation they will dispute the
[5:18] expression if they weren't a drinker
[5:20] that started drinking because they done
[5:21] you just do not you know well Jesus
[5:24] saved my soul let's talk about
[5:25] revelations for revelation what do you
[5:28] mean I thought there's too many of this
[5:31] and that like brother Adam even said you
[5:33] got told he said you know John must have
[5:36] had a three pepper supper of them out
[5:38] before when he was saying what he was
[5:40] having indigestion
[5:41] bad dreams but it's clearly stated that
[5:47] join was derived what he saw and send it
[5:50] to these churches and the churches are
[5:52] supposed to take it but like I said last
[5:55] night each one of these Church ages they
[5:59] lived that anointing and never knew they
[6:02] were in church eight forward church a
[6:04] three Iranians never stood up and said
[6:08] I'm church age messenger number three no
[6:10] he had an anointing for the time
[6:13] preached this sermon and the men are the
[6:15] people took that anointing and took it
[6:18] out to the church right Columba even
[6:21] like I said before Colombo passed away
[6:22] before the church age even started but
[6:25] church age is not just the seven stars
[6:29] it's the people it's not it is seven men
[6:33] that begins it but it's not seven men
[6:35] they just and that's all God used them
[6:39] because we're going to see right here
[6:40] that they were in right handy at seven
[6:42] stars and out of his mouth was a
[6:45] two-edged sword what he came through
[6:46] those seven men and she has another
[6:50] thing you start going by denomination
[6:52] people you start talking about putting
[6:53] me in these position and they'll just
[6:56] ridicule you today oh yeah oh yeah even
[7:00] though lugar it's definitely the founder
[7:04] of the Lutheran doctrine why they call
[7:07] it blueprint and they'll still tell you
[7:09] now that was just something that came up
[7:11] I thought to him before John Wesley oh
[7:13] yeah he's a Methodist but see then you
[7:16] got Wesleyan ISM you got all these
[7:17] different things that comes out of it
[7:19] but like brother Graham said the man
[7:20] comes on the scene preaches the pure
[7:22] message of God when he leaves the scene
[7:24] it just becomes chaos because the man's
[7:26] not there and and then the people taking
[7:29] so I stand Blucher told us to kill all
[7:31] the priests no Luther was saying you
[7:34] need to kill the doctrine this in the
[7:35] priests you know but they they took the
[7:38] extreme same thing with brother ground
[7:41] same thing happened all down through
[7:43] there
[7:46] I mean the messenger goes off the same
[7:49] that's when Satan gets in listen the
[7:52] devil's been here almost as long as
[7:55] God's been here because God created him
[7:59] first so the devil's been here through
[8:02] that all this and he's not standing down
[8:05] here at the end of the age going no he
[8:09] knows what he wants to do okay he wants
[8:11] to get rid of us because he keeps
[8:16] standing there going on I don't know
[8:18] where they went
[8:19] I don't believe the devil's ever seen
[8:20] the snakes dimension I don't think God
[8:23] lets him roam around in that sixth
[8:24] dimension no way that's just for the
[8:27] people that are mourning him - brother
[8:29] Graham said the only thing here is
[8:31] perfect love and same thing there so
[8:35] that states dimension when somebody dies
[8:37] it's like I've always said before he the
[8:39] Death Angel comes to pick them up and
[8:41] this white light comes into room Michael
[8:43] comes in and goes yeah this one's mine
[8:45] where are you gonna take them thought
[8:47] you were talking about last night
[8:48] there's a Satan has a railing accusation
[8:52] against Michael in the book Jews and the
[8:55] Jews Jude one where Satan is disputing
[8:59] where Moses go and in other words my
[9:03] bullet Damon said ain't not your
[9:05] business
[9:06] just not really any of your business
[9:09] this one's mine and he takes them into
[9:11] the sixth dimension and then Satan says
[9:13] I before their ad but I know where mine
[9:15] are you know so he's trying to gather
[9:17] his subjects what's the Bible says in
[9:20] that other dimension but just just
[9:23] realize one thing for sure God has took
[9:25] this these seven Church ages and he has
[9:28] protected a group of people I mean
[9:31] totally protected that group of people
[9:33] that died under their church age
[9:36] messenger all right all the way up to
[9:38] today alright we which are alive and
[9:41] remain so we are here we are the week
[9:45] and I want to miss the silicon go count
[9:48] stays 1 lakh into the Son of Man clothed
[9:50] with a garment down to the foot and Girt
[9:51] about the paps were going girl he's
[9:53] having his hair with white like wool
[9:56] yeah well I like wall
[9:59] why snow and what brother I say that was
[10:02] judgment remember the big one the one
[10:05] that put on the wig that's divine
[10:06] judgment it's heroin by his hair was
[10:10] white like wool Jesus not an old man
[10:15] darn ain't never had gray hair come on
[10:18] that's even God's never been old if
[10:21] God's old we're in trouble
[10:23] because we're supposed to be made in His
[10:25] image okay I I just don't think he's an
[10:30] old man there with white with white hair
[10:32] now like I said before if you watch some
[10:35] of the Old English over in Britain when
[10:38] they come into the court the judges got
[10:41] that white wig on right which brother
[10:43] Branham says that's being a judge he's
[10:45] judgment some of their watch so what a
[10:49] judge you saw that's that Christ no wait
[10:53] a minute he's in bright form right here
[10:58] he's not in father form you understand
[11:01] what I mean he's then son of man form
[11:05] are coming down through the bride
[11:08] because the Bible says that the Saints
[11:11] will judge
[11:15] so the judgments going to be through me
[11:17] in you listen the first church age yeah
[11:20] they're gonna be judged by Jesus Christ
[11:21] but they're gonna be Paul should you be
[11:23] judged what I found what I said Irene
[11:26] yes he never probably said it before but
[11:27] he probably come to a realization that
[11:29] man or somebody did and said hey that
[11:32] message he's preaching is a truth and
[11:35] i'm coming i'm gonna be judged if I
[11:38] don't receive that I'm gonna be judged
[11:41] so guess what when you get some walking
[11:44] on judgement it's not just one God
[11:46] standing there with the books it says
[11:50] Thrones brother Graham said we'll all be
[11:54] standing around the judgement judge why
[11:56] because we are the ones that God's gonna
[11:59] judge the people is
[12:02] it's by the character of the bride and
[12:05] that adage miss harris wise wolf and his
[12:10] eyes flame of fire he speed liking the
[12:13] fine brass with runs to different divine
[12:15] judgment and if they burned in the
[12:17] furnace and his voice as the sound of
[12:19] many people waters his people all right
[12:23] the sound of many people while ago this
[12:26] many members body alright he's
[12:29] describing the whole bride he's really
[12:30] not describing Jesus Christ he's
[12:34] describing the bride what the
[12:36] characteristic of the bride is because
[12:39] Jesus himself the body man's not coming
[12:41] until this is finished and we're all
[12:45] over here in the end the millennium okay
[12:48] so one evening bride for him but it's
[12:51] his form it's the form he chose today
[12:55] and he had in his right hand seven stars
[12:59] and out of his mouth went what the word
[13:03] the two-edged sword the word the word is
[13:06] what's going to do the judgment and its
[13:08] countless was that the sunshine that's
[13:10] any strength to man him and he just you
[13:13] know shine from through he'll butter
[13:14] cake and when I saw him I fell at his
[13:23] feet as dead and these ladies around
[13:26] hand upon meats there unto me fear not I
[13:29] am the first in the last I am he that
[13:32] liveth and was dead now that can't be
[13:34] the Holy Ghost or the father that had to
[13:40] be Jesus the Savior comes he not any
[13:44] baby not he's literally that body was
[13:47] they brother Brown said it laid cold in
[13:50] the grave for 48 hours or longer yet
[13:53] laid in that tomb dead and it would have
[13:58] corrupted had not the scripture told him
[14:02] that he could raise back up
[14:04] within the three days I am he that
[14:07] liveth and was dead and behold I am
[14:11] Alive
[14:11] for evermore and have the keys of hell
[14:15] and of death
[14:16] all right so you've got the teeth of
[14:18] Helen of death write the things which
[14:22] thou has seen and the things which are
[14:25] and the things which shall be Hereafter
[14:27] in other words write what you're seeing
[14:29] them what you do and then the things
[14:33] which shall be Hereafter
[14:36] what's now the same things which are
[14:38] things with Speer after the mystery know
[14:41] us he tells us the mystery of the Seven
[14:43] Stars which thou saw it in my right hand
[14:46] and the Seven golden candlesticks now
[14:48] the seven stars are the angels are
[14:51] messengers of the seven churches now no
[14:55] one knew John penned this in 1896 and
[14:59] then we say ended Interscope
[15:02] 1896 John penned is the seven stars were
[15:07] not revealed though until this man came
[15:09] and God revealed who the stars were Co
[15:15] seven stars of the seven angels are the
[15:17] angels of the seven churches which then
[15:20] he revealed all the seven churches put
[15:22] the dates in when they started when he
[15:24] when they stopped right and the seven
[15:28] candlesticks which thou sawest are the
[15:30] seven churches there's only going to be
[15:33] seven churches
[15:34] okay there's Bible you can't make no
[15:38] difference now we'll start right here
[15:44] just for a second then we'll back up
[15:45] next week until the angel or unto the
[15:49] messenger of the Church of Ephesus write
[15:53] don't you notice them now Jesus told us
[15:56] he's the Alpha and Omega right all right
[16:00] is that true now let me borrow
[16:11] I think it only on 14 all right if you
[16:16] don't have your Bible listen to this now
[16:19] it was alpha no media all right first
[16:22] and the last
[16:23] so the first message the first message
[16:26] and the last message one wants to bring
[16:30] the church ages then one was to usher it
[16:33] out right so they have a common
[16:36] denominator but what your Bible says to
[16:38] the Angel of the Church of Ephesus
[16:42] okay write these things then he goes and
[16:48] says to the angel of the church in
[16:50] Smyrna to the angel so he's got to come
[16:56] to the angel for every one of them for
[16:59] the Angel of the Church of Philadelphia
[17:00] the Angel of the Church of the Lamb
[17:03] since it's always to the messenger first
[17:07] come to the angel to the angel to the
[17:10] angel first so I want you to see this
[17:14] guy to me according to the Bible I don't
[17:16] care what the people and their believe
[17:19] I'm coming message people that are well
[17:21] non message people that are believing
[17:23] that brother Brown went to several
[17:24] church a messenger that's okay but
[17:26] there's got to be one right or the
[17:29] Bible's not completely because God has
[17:32] go has to go to the angel our messenger
[17:35] of this church ditional edition listen
[17:37] listen listen to this one that's why
[17:40] they got that out of the whole Bible or
[17:43] take it if no there's no picking at you
[17:47] there's no picking and choosing because
[17:49] you're gonna go simple look he said in
[17:51] the first chapter it was that this was
[17:53] the beginning this was the beginning I
[17:57] am the Alpha and Omega the first and the
[17:59] left this church age started with God
[18:01] giving a message to an angel to deliver
[18:04] to the church then this message right
[18:06] here don't matter who they whose name
[18:09] they put in there there's got to be a
[18:11] seventh person come in this end time and
[18:15] God's got to give him a message
[18:19] and then he's going to take that message
[18:21] and give it to the church are the whole
[18:23] Bible Trump just throw out the Book of
[18:26] Revelations because that's the whole
[18:27] basis why did God put it in brother
[18:31] Brown said it was put in divine order it
[18:33] was the last book of the Bible and each
[18:36] one of these he's talked to the churches
[18:38] first he identified who he was if you've
[18:41] been reading your revelation of Jesus
[18:42] Christ he's identifying who he is first
[18:45] and where he is he's Alpha 2 mega heard
[18:50] about the top so he sends feminist son
[18:51] of man bride for him and he's going to
[18:54] give a message he's gonna give a message
[18:59] to a messenger and that messenger is
[19:01] going to give the message to the people
[19:02] now that's from here all the way through
[19:05] any can't get about right here and go
[19:07] wait a minute this ain't working no it's
[19:10] work that's right that's why he made it
[19:13] that way
[19:13] so whatever started here I don't care
[19:16] for you I really don't care if you put
[19:18] if they say well I don't know about
[19:20] these you know denomination I'm about
[19:22] these you put these names in here forget
[19:24] about the name 3 the Bible history he's
[19:28] gotta send it to an angel of a Church of
[19:32] Ephesus write write these things says he
[19:42] that holdeth the Stemmons 7 starting -
[19:44] what's he doing he's going back to the
[19:45] first person saying hey I still got them
[19:47] seven stars in my hand
[19:49] okay they're mine to handle possession
[19:53] so he owns him seven men completely
[19:57] that's why brother Brown said he he
[20:00] thought somewhere in here he was gonna
[20:02] put Polycarp right he thought Polycarp
[20:07] fit the bill or fit the UM criteria but
[20:13] the Holy Spirit said nope there's one
[20:14] thing I've got against him he was
[20:17] lenient toward organized religion of the
[20:19] day
[20:19] one little mark kept them from being the
[20:23] trkage so if one little mark kept him
[20:25] here we go
[20:26] if one little mark kept him then one
[20:29] little mark can't keep these two people
[20:30] it would keep these people out man
[20:34] one little lark one little mark thanks
[20:40] to a cloud what if he wants that one
[20:42] little mark would keep him out and
[20:43] that's what they're saying
[20:44] then he made a mistake oh I made a
[20:46] mistake by giving the message to this
[20:48] man right here and he's a deceiver no
[20:50] we've heard that now that he said
[20:52] whatever they say it is easy to see
[20:55] please be careful be careful when you
[20:59] call them a deceiver but you know what
[21:01] you're doing you're calling god of the
[21:03] saber because right here we're gonna
[21:05] stop the books there this thing I think
[21:08] it's what is it in play all right and to
[21:11] the Angel of the Church of Ephesus write
[21:17] these things saith he that holdeth the
[21:22] seven star so it's coming straight from
[21:24] God to that messenger to a church not
[21:32] the pattern nail I mean get the pattern
[21:34] holes I'm back to this again if the
[21:36] pattern holds we gotta have a messenger
[21:38] here somebody's got to get that message
[21:43] from God to give us now that last
[21:47] interchange so that's what Paul did
[21:49] Paul's message called them out of the
[21:51] Ephesian Church a member rots in no age
[21:56] Brydon like you coming to Bryson in
[21:58] heavenly places so we've been called out
[22:00] of this but we still read the
[22:01] characteristic we're still in time we're
[22:03] still in the age still got the
[22:04] characteristically age right but God
[22:09] says I've got to have an angel and I
