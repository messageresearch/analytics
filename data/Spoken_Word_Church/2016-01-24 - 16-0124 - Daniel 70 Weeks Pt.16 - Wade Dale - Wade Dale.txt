TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Richard there many many times they'll go travel to a just cool and they got a computer locked up or something they'll just turn it off hit reset turn around back home and then computer guys like it when they charge you about hundred bucks an hour they don't strain your brain to to do what you should have done so I mean really you can you can do away with a lot of your computer problem just by turning off turn my home even your cell phones and need even these iPads turn them off every once awhile leave them off for about five or ten minutes let it reboot get all the garbage junk out of it right when you got read it yeah when in doubt reboot and then just turn around I going to eat my cell phone if yourself won't start running slow or these things start running slow turn them off leave them off for about five minutes let everything settle down turn right back on for me too yeah Jim lays down for five minutes good everybody she removed but as we left last Sunday we're talking on this laughs and with my paper mill last week's yeah my ahead my dad my young at my get some timers you know all right so now yeah you turn on that ok we are horrible we're going to focus on this last week now we had many times before many times before we're showing this time period between this this parenthesis and this one here all right that is the 490 years that God promised the jeers and their Redemption all right it may go cable that we're on to that point right seventy times seven is 490 years all right Jesus in the scripture they asked him said how many times do you forgive someone he's at seven times he said no seventy times seven well that's kind of strange that he was telling them that Israel it's going to be four hundred ninety years before you retain all right to go through Redemption so we are how's Danny home he home ok Bo Danny's been in a hospital after the most of the week so hope everybody keeps men in prayer but he's doing okay now that means he's cranky and yeah I know anyway I like owner seem like I'm doing before take away from you how do you display hain't no place like home in hospitals are all right but it was a lot better to recover from the house alright so now the four hundred nine years now then we showed where the wild branch was brought in just going to try to bring you back everybody up we'll wrap so if if you really if you took this out and pull this and this together okay you would have had the 490 years consecutive 490 years nobody understand that day man you'd have consecutive 490 years to fulfill the scripture but you got to remember that the scripture was written knowing that we would fall knowing that the Gentiles will be brought in so the scripture was written so that this would happen core knowledge God before knowledge wrote the Bible because they knew what was going to happen knew that we were going to all reject him at County Jews included and that he was going to paul says low i turned to the Gentiles all was the first church age messenger and during all this time now there was a lot of Israel let's say hold on there was a lot of Israelites individuals got if lot of individuals that were saved during this time but most of it especially from about right here to here with Gentile okay all right let's see they were saved at the Jews in the beginning at that clinic off they will say 120 was saved in the upper room but there was others added so it wasn't as a nation never Israel as a nation was saved or redeemed until we get over to here okay but the Gentiles 12 you know in continuance we come through here through the revelations chapter 1 through 3 and we see the church ages the church ages is a Gentile age right now that's why I want you to see it um that right here though as soon as that last Gentile at save right here I mean yes we know for a fact there was an overlap because we're going to talk about this not this sunday but in two sundays from now we're going to kind of go through the 1947-48 Israel becoming a nation remember they gather it all together brother branham talked about it many times Israel gathering as a nation well they have to gather here so God can start dealing with them here that's why that God had to start bringing them together here it's going to be off on Omega even in the Jewish stems the money stamkos remember your alpha your alpha age is how the Alpha is the first okay first alphabet alpha your alpha bride okay its one guy what about tipping them Lord Jesus Christ no there was no strange doctrines like they are now there was some but most of your church was built this is built on the Apostles profits with the correct interpretation of the Bible okay if I got to the correct interpretation about you so it's got to end with the correct interpretation about now what happens in between is not correct interpretation diploma because when they started in here in ad I mean yeah an ad in 306 hundred eighty they come in father son Holy Spirit church age from here to here and even part of this one I had a Trinitarian idea right so God had to restore Malachi 4 had to restore the faith of the father's to the children nobody John the Baptist did John the Baptist right here took the old father's from the Old Testament and restore them to the New Testament Gentile age all right that's Malachi 4 5 and he shall turn the hearts of the father's to the children hmm and the hearts of the children back to the father's a message of restoration to restore back they said Wayne saying that because God can't pattern Israel any other way pattern holds true watch remember what I told you there was no salvation in here of a group called Israel that's the Old Testament but they wouldn't they were cut but they had to be what 445 bc established them into what a nation so that God could start dealing with them and then the Messiah come to them they reject him all right so what's gonna happen over here God's got a somewhere right here bring it back to restoration as a nation he's going to restore them back as a nation okay I got all right I got to restore them back and then what does he do he begins dealing with them he said oh no well yeah he had the Gracie remember God had to bring him in as a nation if he said I'm only going to deal with you as a nation then he's got him storm back to that nation that nationality okay so God right in here this is in a lap over remember I told you all the church ages are like this truly because brother bridal calls it this lap over well there's people come now this age into this age okay but there's no lap over in the last church age this is the finishing of the Gentile age and the beginning of the what Jewish age are the age of the children of Israel right now what happened when they were beginning to come in who came on the same no man I'm just giving you this because I want you to we've got to turn our thought to this who was the son of man they crucified the son of man you can't kill the son of god we just went through seats three sons name son of God son of man son of David Wright they can't kill son of man I mean you killed son of man he killed son of God and then brother Brown said down through the church ages it was what Sun God Spirit God butt back here we're beginning from here to here what do you have right here I'm at a revelation again ok now we missed him here the Jews did the Gentile is dead the Gentiles accepted right here and receive the new birth Israel didn't sue so if this pattern holds true then this patterns got to hold the same troupe does this pattern at the ending of the Gentile age the Son of Man comes on the scene and this time they don't crucify they accept him just like we accepted a minute all right ok so the pattern has to hold so a man comes on the scene revelation of the Son of Man comes on the scene so the revelation son of man's gotta come on the scene in the last Turk age because without the revelation the son of man you can't consent a man to the rapture so our man's gotta be on same same take a rapture but when the Sun man goes up which is us in human flesh Sun man is all of us not God guards not coming down here until way back over here right right but right here that's what I said before I scriptures not only to the Jews when it says where you get those scars when you receive the new birth you had to see those cars if you can see those cars you didn't get morning and you so I didn't see them see their we're going in you what I mean see understand you need to understand those scarf he came visible to you through the word you got convicted to what happened and what you do you saw gone and gone born again what you think's going to happen right here they're gonna preach a sermon we read it last Sunday where did you get those scars he said in the house of my friend well he got it back here but the revelation is going to come right here okay they missed that revelation right there digital did the Gentiles accepted it the revelation Peter says there are the Christ the Son of the Living God jesus said upon this rock revelation I'll build my church well he built the church on sun god revelation all down through here this was all son of god but you had to come back to the Son of Man revelation to take a rapture okay so son man has to be back on the scene just like he was here except he's not in a body form he's in a mini member body form all right not one man brother Brad almost not beasts on lad he had the manosphere the son of man but he was ice on a man he was a beast on the man all right that's the same way you and I sure we're still sons and daughters of a living God but when we take a when we take a body change truly that's the son of man standing on earth again in a mini member buddy because if he would have had any problems in his self he wouldn't resurrect he was God he was God okay same way we're here we can't have problems for these right here for us once said this is important without needs and this added two things that we've got to understand about the body change you can't you can take a bunny thing you've gone by the great you know your Christians could look you say well what what's the big deal what a big deal is big deal is is uh this first church age had all this right but they didn't have a son of man revelation that's some God revelation but they're dead laying in the grave waiting on somebody alright same way was all down through the church ages they had a son of God revelation what think God died for their sins forgave them came into their life started taking up a bow and they started acting different okay pattern holds true everywhere so same thing is going to happen over here in this last part of Daniel seventy weeks the redemption of Israel I believe they're gonna have to go through justification sanctification in the baptism run all the goes to receive the new birth just like me and you did okay and and this church is built on it and I believe because you know one I went through it I went through justification sanctification baptism holds up sign tell you exactly where come through that can you or do you just walk into message church this amount that's my question to you go devices lot quicker I can smoking gambling on we're starting on church that's just sanctification that's just being sanctified no one gets you in the body now sure if you were in another age but that won't get you born again now you're not you're going on sure you might give you life of the gospel but you're not going on a raptor and you're on going up to a body change for sure only much see these were mature these were good tour people these are got to be mature people that's lame is restoring the faith of the children babbling babies Pentecostal baby back to what the original father's the background Twelve Apostles right and now we got I just want to get that in to show you that the pattern holds true everywhere Israel had to come back together as a nation before God would deal with him he dealt with them all to here with the prophets many times and they rejected him and then they rejected the true prophet but if there would have been no Gentiles and you would have just took this line and moved it right over to here they would have accepted him but see the Bible wasn't written that way the Bible was written with two prophets injected the Bible was written with 1260 days to the juice Oh God knew that week you know there's a lot of things you can say well they're not have not been a father won't happen it really doesn't matter what is in the Bible to me are useless but what if we didn't the Bible was written it are you going to change Oh is he going to change the Bible just go to what you thought should happen no yep all right so remember now I want you to get something to this right here so this right here is God dealing with a Gentile people individuals right now but when we go in a rapture God comes back down into profits will read in just a minute for 1260 days now that's what you on your what's your chart nobody got your chart all right you need to bring this need to be with you need to be with you the whole time this needs to be important because this is where most of the contention is in the message brutal Elise was bringing up the other Sunday what is the contention well the contention is in a nutshell and then we'll go back and I'll read you the folks will do all that right at the end I'm going to some of this thing up with with about two or three weeks of forgetting the dates because the dates to me don't matter to us but it does to the gyms because there are date people there are timepiece so it means something to them that's why the feast days don't mean anything to us it's off to the juice right we're not guaranteed to fix nothing we're not well I can you show me the Bible where it says the Gentiles are guaranteed ten times you guarantee nothing nothing that's why i said before finally in the Bible where we're going to be in a wedding supper for 1260 days that's right but it still it's not a it's not a feast that we're talking about have nothing to do what we're talking about ok a feast day to us should be every day yeah ok feast of Pentecost is a daily to us but the Jews that's why say you got to get your brain back over in the Israel in the Jewish time because there is a day god told him he said on the fourteenth day after the first month of the year you gonna have a passover on that day you know go swap days it's gonna be 14 days you get ready for my feast gosh don't get God don't you get ready for your face you gotta get ready for his feet ok because their head yeah so most of the people in the message just in a nutshell because of some of the quotes that they misinterpret mr. prophet said because look brother I'm could not misinterpret the Bible he was a Bible preacher profit interpreter of the Divine Scripture so he can't be wrong in that aspect he can say 5000 and mean 500 that ain't got nothing to do that's just a human mistake and like I said last section I'm gonna say it one more time I do not care if 16 people fell off a bridge right I hope you understand what I'm saying I'm not belittling nothing but what I'm telling you is people are basing their salvation I'm not finding 16 people and a fell off a bridge you don't work hard you know what was really hard was for Isaiah to go to Hezekiah and say you're dying tomorrow get your stuff ready Hezekiah goes to praying as n goes back and sets down under a tree or whatever doing his going about if they duties delivered mail or whatever you know he's he's uh he's out there working yeah making honey and and God's over there saying Hezekiah heard your prayer now why didn't God just say Hezekiah that's all right you just you're gonna live another 15 years no he had me go back to Isaiah and go and i was there go Jess floor he said go back to Hezekiah cuz look no women he said well that's tough he told him read the Bible thus saith the Lord get your house ready you're gonna die well buddy let me tell you something if it was this age that's happened this man I mean we believe I mean that's going to happen but now if we were reading a commentary of that okay a message book let's put it that way we were reading the message book and brother Brown says I said Lord has a guy you're going to die and that's put in print that's our problem all this is them print and there you know on the video and Internet that's the whole problem with the whole thing the devil's got in and diluted the whole thing but if we ran a message but we're brother and sister said Lord John Henry you go down alright saying we just read that book say we don't get read all of them we read that book right and he says I said Lord John here in one week you're going to be dead two weeks later John here it comes in the store now what you gonna think that prophet was lying no I probably what line that prophet done what God told him to do the people the people the one who changed the mind of God see then you go back about two weeks later and if you have another message vote for brother Graham says well God woke me up in a vision and told me to tell go back and tell John Henry that he's heard his prayer and he'll live but what if you never got that book what if you just got one book that's what the imagined divorced guys and it was on what's his name up there and Jefferson Building I won't call it once it's Trevor yeah remember that you say that we'll see the people over in Africa they read a marriage and divorce book barossa Brennan said polygamy would be all right and it was legal back then and all that they don't read the other messages because they're going he said it right here you know cuz what they were doing pushing polygamy that brother branham was a polygamous preacher so if you read one book you just you just narrow minded but brother Bridal always and I love what Clark told me one time they stuck with me forever brother round said face final resting place is in the Word of God face fine when I put my face I'm gonna put my face on what the word shift now brother branham was a divine interpreter of that word so he could not be wrong when he come to major doctrinal issues man right so that's where I say because that was the son of man ministry he was preaching that's the same thing to come out of this man's mouth piece on the man had to be or we're not go Pat earn our patterns off it's not the Ministry of the same man who the son of man hears it was there yes ok so their contention is in the message cornered a few quote is that the seventy weeks of Daniel is going to totally end when the two prophets finished prophesying because they said Jesus freaks three and a half years here which was the first half of the 70th week which there's no way you can't put it in the Bible you can't put it in them in the time you can't put in the prophets message so that's wrong okay but they put two three and a half years back here of Jesus's ministry and then there's only three and a half years left of the 70th week according the Bible that's not true according the problem I suppose that is true that there's just two and a half years how do you ministry the two prophets unless let me show it let me give you some scriptures going to write them down not going to i'm not going to read them all but where i read some of them daniel 7 25 excuse me Daniel 12 we're going to talk about in just a few minutes Daniel 12 7 brother revelations 13-5 revelations 11 3 and daniel 9 27 all speaks of a three and a half year period now look this is what they'll cost well once you don't want to be confused Daniel here says time 1 x 2 and a half one two three and a half that's three and a half years in Revelation 13 5 it says 42 months what's 42 months three and a half years alright revelations 11 3 says the two prophets will prophesy for 1,260 days alright got it 12 hour 60 days and then Daniel 9 27 says in the midst of the week now what's the middle seven yeah okay that's why I according to Daniel 9 27 then in the midst of the week he'll break the Covenant what the Antichrist so if he breaks it into midst of the week we can only be smart enough to understand there's green have more left right it ok I mean let's but I got a quote well how's that head one day okay then you make I live all property you know jesus said many times he said I won't say some things in other words let me paraphrase 20th century I'm gonna paraphrase this for Jesus Jesus and I'm gonna say some things that you will not understand but the ones that spoke to whip wait you just said eat my flesh and drink my blood and he walked off he did not explain it but when the Holy Ghost fell on Paul Paul never heard jesus said that that's right now Matthew or mark or Luke or John my decoder will see remember mark and Luke didn't know Jesus it was really just Matthew and John they may have told Paul then one day Jesus said eat my flesh and drink my blood and walked off well even when they told call that the Holy Ghost quick and call and said oh I don't want he was talking about I have received the Lord that's which we read it ever communion Paul was the Institute ur of the communion showing that the body was the bread and the blood was the wine in symbolic so we eat his flesh and drink his blood that's what they were saying about the apostles remember when they couldn't find the body of Jesus alright so movie come out about that you see that there's a movie come out a big picture movie I saw the previews the other down on YouTube but I can't remain it's called risen but what it is it's a perspective from a Roman soldier trying to find the body of Jesus he's like a FBI agent he goes out tries to find the king and all are piloting all him like you got to find this body you know we we got this proof so what he has to do he has to go and find Jesus's followers and talk to them and ask them well I don't know if there's a conversion at the end but I mean this guy's just it shows them putting Jesus in the tomb and putting the seal on you know and then he introduced uh it's kind of like a modern day but it was back then you know so like a modern-day FBI he brings two guys in this is what happened there's a weirdo man to this rock started falling everywhere and you know the hearth earthquake and we heard this wind and we looked in the tomb and he was going well who stole it will hurt you know so they go and it might be something good to watch but but you ever but now remember right here his revelations 123 kind of go for some you just a little bit but revelations 41 revelations 1921 is this last part so everybody says that this right here is going to end the seventy weeks of Daniel when I broke I'll never taught that there's no way the Bible teaches that okay right but keeping your mind that three and a half years that I just told you about right there that's all of the Ministry of Jesus Christ is left on the face of the earth to the Jews got it 42 months all that I told you 42 months time time and a half time all that got it but we know for a fact that there's one week left after the rapture according to the Bible according the province message and like I said before according to the feast days that we're going to get into a little bit later alright but watch real simple here real real real real simple men will read the Bible says that seventy weeks are determined to do six things we rather there six things got to be accomplished inside of this excuse me 490 years all right nice Bible reading after that really interpretation seventy weeks are determined to and goes all through sit list six of them then what Gabriel does in Daniel 9 25 he starts to explain how right says he will be at seven there'll be a seven year period of 60 two-week period and prince that shall come shall destroy the city what I taught us in 80 70 never really speaks anything because look Gabriel is not an angel to the Gentile gable don't announce to the Gentiles Michael is our his army is our man okay all right but Michaels cries to everybody right what I'm saying his gable doesn't announce anything about the turkey he didn't say anything about getting off he just goes right in and says the prince is going to destroy and in the myth and then the press that shall come and the other one right here he's going to make a covenant with many for one way but he say well he said many he makes it with the whole world you don't just make it with the Jews now the Jews are the central factor right but remember the Bible talks about peace and he comes in with flattery he's got to get the whole world involved with getting now he's getting the whole world involved okay now at the end everybody's going to turn on Israel why so I said when he breaks that covenant he's going to break it to the Jews but what's going to happen is as the whole world's gone then come against Jews so the post or a say the Pope the Antichrist is gathering during that three and a half years you think he's taking a vacation he's not only to ride or ever you know smoking cigars and drinking wine he's working on this part and this right here is the Battle of Armageddon so he's got to get everybody together to destroy Israel Satan hates Israel and you don't think it's Satan inside of a man doing the work it is remember it was Satan inside of a man back in the garden right here Satan inside of a man same way here Twila calling the beast in the beginning and the beast in the end all right we're watching I mean listen to the seals and he distinctly that's where a lot of people tell us that no I'll take what he said in the cells over this book right here and exactly he distinctly said there are three only three light years left drawer after the rapture to the juice but he didn't say they what all the pasta cute right that's the problem you don't you don't listen to what he's saying because you can't say something hot contrary to the scripture because look if they prophesied for 1260 days and then they're killed the ministry is over alright then all heck's going to break legs when out how you're going to do these other three of the six whole purpose how you gonna put these three in here because what they say to make to make their theory correct all this goes over here but they never one time spoke on the six full purpose because they don't understand it and the seats fold purpose if you really go to studying the six volt purpose it explains to you what Dana said in two weeks is this has got to be after the redemption of Israel but look you say all business with them redemptions over while wearing Daniel it's just cool to Daniel 9 and I told you we're gonna hit this hard right here this is what I miss it yes good seventy weeks of terminal who that people and and and upon the holy city they know nothing about city over here this is people but what your hand this is people this is a redemption of Israel flesh guy this is the redemption of Israel to City bring in could wire the city set up the vision and prophecy will get into all these North the most holy all right then the 70 week period will in okay now let's go back to only work and then let's go back to Daniel 12 like I said something I hadn't seen good just sitting right there in the Bible cuz once and that time Michael Shiel stands out the great French with standard for children then there should be time of trouble such as never was since it was the nation where's that out that's not Michael standing up right here right here hmm this is going to be a tribulation period but the great tribulation is going to be right here that battle of Armageddon since there was a nation even to that same time at that time thy people shall be delivered what 144,000 going to go out I know right hand you can write it right here and this will mark that's the end of 1260 days when he breaks that covenant with the Jews they're going to come against Israel they're going to income class the Israel and they're going to fight against Israel okay and everything is going to be destroyed right now that's why I'm saying if everything is destroyed right there and the people the most of the preachers in the message say that that ends the seventy weeks of Daniel then something's wrong the only thing we're going don't I'm we're gonna bring in everlasting righteousness so provision profiting on come on trollese after of the battle armor getting over just come to me it's just read the Bible okay you say why why brother I'd say what he did I will explain that later okay one thing that time first 12 and I heard the man close the lemon which was part of the river know why Daniels still in the vision notice right hand left hand to Heaven I swear if I even live a friend that should be for a time times and a half when he shall accomplish together the power of the holy people all these things shall be finished people people and people three and a half years is the people Israel flesh and the holy city okay okay because really sure watch and I think I didn't minister to me not go watch that again but the first three finish transgression McKenna's in red suit for excellent indicative that's justification sanctification in the baptism holy go that bursts you into the body the first three the profits are going to pre is redemption finish your transgression making understand reconciliation for iniquity 33 things justification same protections about feeling holding up hi right then then you got your other three right here this is for the city because what what are we go you know you say well how do you know that well now the Bible tells us that right here when we come back in Revelations 1920 ones with the prophets in when we come back we come back to a city hmm I got it right here in Isaiah 65 alright we come back to a city in a temple built by the israel we don't build temple okay okay how's that going to happen like that then game okay have it goes at the end of that 70 of weakness when the feast starts that last speed when we're going to talk about later on mmm all right cuz remember they're still under there this is all to the Jews from here 1007 years because the millenniums a thousand years okay and you got seven years right here that's the last week if I ok with that cuz what's going to happen right here I told you on your chart just put dot dot dot dot nothin cuz remember Tom continues on to the look through the Millennium is still time you must rush Isaiah is 6520 there should be no more less an infant of days nor an old man that have not filled his days for the child shall die 100 years old but the center being 100 years old shall be a curse we'll have to get into that later and they shall build houses and inhabit them who's they the Jews the fish still cute the heathen never how they're ever how that thousand years is going to transpire if you're born again don't worry about it you don't be there and I don't think you're gonna walk in and go a lot optician totally differently yeah and they shall free to get that part I thought you're going downhill when I starts and then when thought you're really going down and they shall build houses and inhabit them now that's not the future home right remember the future home is built by Jesus Christ himself according to our desires that's we on over here pass the whopper own judgment passed the Battle of Gog and Magog way over here so let's stay Michael here they shall go to housing and habit them they shall plant vineyards and eat fruit of them they shall not build in another inhabit see we build houses now then we give them to our kids you see what that's what they're saying we build houses they inherited because we die and we'll be on a diet is it going to build them at another there shall not build in another habit they shall not plant and another eat all right they shall not labor in vain I bring forth for trouble but they have the seat of the blessed of the lord and their offspring with them before they call our answer while there yet speaking over here the wolf and the lamb shall feed together he's coming out the Millennium okay come back the Millennium Linea rein good but what's got to get us there is this 70 weeks let's go let's go to verse 11 right here this is where we were at last Sunday will read this again and we really didn't get into it I wanted to but looking into it to sunday bro the least take your next sunday will be a blowjo greens this time for sure so and from the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away now what did we establish Jews and is the Jews and the Antichrist is going to make a covenant he's going to allow temple worship they're trying to get to my side bag 144,000 says he's already he's already hearing us he's going to break that covenant and the abomination is going to happen right here not here from the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away the abomination that maketh desolate set up there shall be 1290 days alright that's over here you said watch more than 1260 what we talked about here remember God doesn't roughly stop something then start something else he'd give up at lap over time here get a life over time here he's gonna have a lap over time here you tell you know that well how you gonna put 1290 days in there the Bible says it so we gotta go by what the Bible said all right in two weeks we'll probably try to get into that and i'm going to lay in here try to be here or at least watch it because from here to here it's going to be the battle all right barmageddon according to this prophets jar according to the Bible it's going to be 1290 days we got 1260 that's 30 more days over all right remember this is still to the Jews so we still going to put the feast days in the feast days are going to fit right in with these 1260 days here the 1290 and even the thirteen hundred and thirty-five it'll fit right into the feast days because they they will have a jubilee year and that's going to be there thousand-year millennial reign that's that you believe they're looking for okay here's we're looking for Jubilee year and I was watching a commentator of the other day and he did a really good job he said when God instituted that he said really there's no record of coming on for word that they used it he said because the rich people he said what if you accumulated well for 50 for 49 years and all of a sudden on that 50th year you got to give everything back and everybody starts pouring in he said the rich people Pharisees and all the ones by he said the rich people would not let them have their feast day I mean they're Jubilee year because they didn't want to give their money back Jews included she was included show me any old tests to show me the New Testament where they said work at work it says to howl that Jubilee here and do not do this and not do that but in history he shows that there's they really don't keep that that year because that year is if i buy bring her take her from you and two of acres from you and I've got 20 servants that that I brought in of yours and you know accumulate all as well when importing idea or the fiftieth year that Jubilee year I got to give you the 300 acres back I got to give you your people back I got Hubie years back everybody starts at zero so nobody wanted to do it but right here is where are you undoing because everything's equal right there at jubilee here that's why brother Brown said that 1977 was the 7-inch Jubilee so there can't be another Jubilee my brother Dale said many years ago take 1977 at 49 years to it you got 2026 there can't be another Jubilee year without us being in the morning candy there's no way it breaks all the good for you
