[0:00] seeing open the eyes of our heart that's
[0:04] so important in this time to have a
[0:05] revelation of what God is doing in their
[0:08] midst
[0:08] and his plan for us and we know that by
[0:12] the revelation of his word to us and
[0:15] through the opening of the word amen
[0:18] open the eyes of my heart Lord les
[0:22] Austin open the eyes of my heart for I
[0:28] want to see you oh Jesus I want to see
[0:39] so open the eyes of my heart Lord open
[0:45] the eyes I want to see you
[0:53] oh I want to see
[0:59] to see you hi and lift it up
[1:04] oh you're shining in the light of your
[1:09] glory so pour out your power in love as
[1:15] we sing holy holy holy so high and
[1:23] lifted up oh you're shining in the light
[1:29] of your glory amen so pour out your
[1:34] power in love as we sing holy holy holy
[1:41] name Oh holy holy holy you are holy holy
[1:53] holy
[1:57] holy holy and I want to see amen and
[2:06] amen and amen and I want to see him
[2:08] don't you
[2:08] they just hear about it in the house of
[2:10] the Lord good to see everybody outside
[2:12] the house of the Lord out there in the
[2:14] cars and the things and just we pray
[2:17] that the Lord would put it to where you
[2:20] can hear real good and everything can be
[2:22] done and then we can really I guess we
[2:25] don't have to worry about this from now
[2:27] and we can tell you you can come outside
[2:29] and park and bring your laptop with you
[2:32] and everything cause it'll go right
[2:35] through the internet system you know you
[2:37] know so if you want to do that but we
[2:39] just have to keep her our you know group
[2:42] of people coming to keep everything
[2:45] running right and all and that's why we
[2:47] do that way you know to get it all to go
[2:50] in and make abide by the the rulings and
[2:53] things but the main thing is just to
[2:56] pray that God would reach down and touch
[2:59] these just the whole world cause never
[3:02] has there been a time that the world was
[3:05] in a turmoil like it is now you know
[3:08] never before it's all that's never been
[3:11] and it's just you know you don't know
[3:14] what's gonna happen from day to day so
[3:16] don't we don't worry about it we just we
[3:19] just going and and take it as we we
[3:22] receive it and be ready against today
[3:25] and then if you like turning your
[3:26] scriptures turned with us to the Book of
[3:29] Luke 24 and we'll read a little bit
[3:33] there just remember to pray for I know
[3:37] you have but for the Addison family her
[3:40] brother dick passing away this morning
[3:42] somewhere around 7:00 7:30 or something
[3:45] this morning and it's a good day to pass
[3:48] in other words if I have to pick a day
[3:51] of the year for her to be my passing
[3:54] away I would definitely either want it
[3:57] to be in or the the events of Calvary
[4:02] and all the connections so but just pray
[4:05] for them they'll let us know whatever
[4:06] and we don't know what they can do
[4:09] no way to know until you get all to
[4:13] doing and they'll let us know because
[4:15] their plans were to cremate the body to
[4:19] take it down to port st. Joe there and
[4:22] you know put his ashes where he always
[4:25] loved to go you know so remember that
[4:28] and then there'll be a memorial
[4:30] somewhere down the road and the church
[4:32] will have one or something if they don't
[4:34] into the basis of that will have a
[4:37] memorial for him because we don't can't
[4:40] have this is the oddest thing that's
[4:43] ever happened in the world when you
[4:45] can't bury people in it and then where
[4:47] they can in places they're just ditching
[4:49] outstrips and just putting the caskets
[4:52] and things in you know and oh there's
[4:54] too many people dying but remember that
[4:56] also remember brother al now his mother
[4:59] passed away there I believe it was
[5:01] yesterday
[5:01] so remember her the family they're the
[5:05] ones that's left you know Al and his
[5:08] brother and just fret the Lord would
[5:11] bless each one the Lord would wave will
[5:15] be ministering winds me so remember that
[5:17] in Petra Lord we've got each one of us
[5:20] alright we're going to Luke 24 we'll go
[5:25] to verse 1 father we thank you for your
[5:27] grace and your love and your
[5:29] understanding thank you for everything
[5:31] thank you for loving us lord thank you
[5:33] for a resurrection time what a day what
[5:36] a time that we have to realize that we
[5:40] are beneficiaries or the resurrection
[5:42] not it was just a day or a time or for
[5:45] somebody else but it's for us and we
[5:48] have the rights of all of the things
[5:50] that goes with the resurrection and the
[5:52] whole entire plan of redemption is based
[5:55] in that because you proved our in the
[5:58] resurrection who you was and what you
[6:01] were doing and everything to be made
[6:03] manifest was proved by your resurrection
[6:06] because no man could raise from the dead
[6:08] unless it be you we love you and we
[6:11] thank you and just have your way
[6:13] bless the Addison family and Resta the
[6:15] Kennard family at all and just be with
[6:18] each one have your way member and others
[6:20] or their sick among us
[6:21] never brother Dale learned us be with
[6:23] humans sister Mary just bless brother
[6:27] Kali Lord and be out with all of us we
[6:30] love you and we thank you in Jesus name
[6:32] Amen
[6:37] naturally we would read the resurrection
[6:43] time it's a good time and we'd read the
[6:45] scriptures of it but it may change a
[6:48] little bit as we go along into the
[6:50] message but let's go to verse 1 Luke 24
[6:55] now pon the first day of the week very
[6:58] early in the morning they came unto the
[7:00] supper to bringing the spices which they
[7:03] had prepared and certain others with
[7:07] them and they found the stone rolled
[7:10] away from the separator they entered in
[7:14] and found not the body of the Lord Jesus
[7:16] and it came to pass as they were much
[7:19] perplexed thereabout behold two men
[7:23] stood by them in shining garments and as
[7:27] they were afraid and bowed their hate
[7:29] their faces to the earth they said unto
[7:32] them why seek ye the living among the
[7:36] dead
[7:36] alright now think of that ycq the living
[7:40] among the dead that's one they went
[7:42] there to see they went to her to see a
[7:43] dead man come find out ain't no dead man
[7:46] there don't fight that ain't no man
[7:48] there cuz he's raised all right what is
[7:50] it
[7:51] they ycq the living among the dead he is
[7:55] not here but his risen remember how he
[7:58] spoke unto you when he was yet in
[8:01] Galilee you may be seated the Lord that
[8:05] his blessings will pick up another
[8:07] scripture connected right to that one in
[8:09] a moment but you know
[8:16] it's a great time to have a Easter
[8:19] services and things we're proud to be
[8:22] able to do that and for the people to be
[8:24] outside with us some things at least
[8:26] they're that close you know under pray
[8:28] that as I said that all of this applies
[8:31] on off and that everything will get back
[8:34] to normal or we can be in services and
[8:37] all because we miss each other I was
[8:39] kidding it some of them out there want
[8:41] to go was I seen them coming by I said
[8:42] where you been you know they said what
[8:46] were you being so he's all do it it was
[8:50] but anyhow it's a good time to be in the
[8:52] life day
[8:53] alright now we know that in the
[9:00] resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ as
[9:04] I said no man had been able to raise you
[9:07] know nobody could do now he could raise
[9:09] God could raise the dead or something
[9:11] like that but nobody could raise this
[9:13] themselves on the basis of their word
[9:16] and that was really what it was he had
[9:19] talked throughout the to his journey of
[9:22] time there with them through the Gospels
[9:26] and talked about the things that would
[9:28] happen and what would take place and and
[9:31] all like that and he was beginning to
[9:33] tell them you know what to expect okay
[9:38] you go to mark and there's about eight
[9:41] thirty one and it says and he began to
[9:43] teach that the son of man must suffer
[9:46] many things and be rejected of the
[9:49] elders and the chief priests and scribes
[9:51] now he that was his teaching coming down
[9:54] and be killed and after three days rise
[10:00] again alright so he spoke of his
[10:03] resurrection
[10:05] okay the Prophet says then in that that
[10:09] that day proved the point of who he was
[10:12] the day that he raised proved who he was
[10:17] that he was Almighty God in human flesh
[10:20] and what nobody else could do that
[10:22] and bring forth but yet he he was
[10:25] speaking and telling them and showing
[10:27] them all the way through the gospel
[10:31] showing them what would happen and it
[10:34] was like to them I guess as it says one
[10:38] time in there was like idle words on
[10:40] going on in Luke a little you know it
[10:42] was like idle words to a lot of people
[10:45] even after they had seen the grave
[10:48] opened even after they had seen it was
[10:51] gone they still could not comprehend or
[10:55] put everything based upon that when
[10:57] they'd had three and a half years of
[10:59] talking about it telling them about it
[11:02] and the best you could come out of it
[11:04] was Peter sitting now now they're not
[11:06] gonna kill you we'll fight then I mean
[11:10] that would be the best you could get out
[11:12] of the whole twelve of them was a fact
[11:15] of one saying or will this fight well
[11:18] that wouldn't no good that wouldn't want
[11:20] nothing about it but I want you to think
[11:23] about now in the resurrection because
[11:27] that resurrection was the said proof dar
[11:32] that who he was
[11:34] okay now now put that to work that you
[11:39] get to where it says that he has risen
[11:41] we know this we've been through it for
[11:43] all of our years talking about the
[11:45] resurrection and the time that it
[11:48] doesn't say he has or was or whatever it
[11:51] puts it into a personal present tense
[11:54] form of saying he is risen all right now
[11:59] see that message has always been the
[12:02] same the reason I'll bring it like that
[12:04] see
[12:04] you'd say come over you know a few years
[12:07] later and said well we know well we know
[12:10] yo we believe he was here and he was
[12:13] raised from the dead and and things like
[12:16] that we believe that but that wouldn't
[12:18] be the gospel that was being brought
[12:21] that gospel that was being brought when
[12:23] it was a saying he is risen it would be
[12:27] from that day until the final
[12:30] resurrection alright now I've said that
[12:34] forgotten well meaning the final
[12:36] resurrection call see there has to be a
[12:37] resurrection there has to be a
[12:40] resurrection in the last days all right
[12:43] and it will finalize in the total
[12:45] resurrection of those that are asleep in
[12:48] Jesus Christ
[12:49] and see then ever generation had the
[12:53] same message well not just looking back
[12:57] or looking forward ever generation had
[13:03] the same message he is risen
[13:07] alright so if anybody ever asked you
[13:09] about the Lord Jesus
[13:10] just tell him say he is risen because
[13:15] you know one no no he did raise back
[13:17] yonder we believe that no no that's not
[13:21] what he said he is risen
[13:25] they they made two proclamations the
[13:28] Angels did in declaring to show that
[13:32] what we should always be saying he is
[13:34] risen
[13:35] and keep that to us to her that we can
[13:39] see that you know in the day that we're
[13:42] living all right now see during this
[13:46] Easter morning as we would call it then
[13:50] he raised from the dead came forth but
[13:54] that wasn't all of it yeah they said we
[14:00] can believe that president can't
[14:02] sometimes that's not all of it it didn't
[14:06] end just by his resurrection what kind
[14:10] of a gospel would we have if we had no
[14:13] connection to the resurrection right
[14:19] well what kind of a gospel would you
[14:21] have welcome what would you be even be
[14:23] thinking about it unless you could say
[14:26] he is risen but now the only way you can
[14:31] say he is risen is for that resurrection
[14:33] to be inside of you speaking out so what
[14:39] is the the the resurrection what is the
[14:42] connection the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[14:45] is the resurrection right because that's
[14:49] the proof of it when we received the
[14:52] baptism in the Holy Ghost that's proof
[14:53] for the resurrection when he raised was
[14:55] proof of who
[14:56] was when he raised it was proof that he
[14:59] was Almighty God and that everything was
[15:01] in control and that he would tell that
[15:04] to every church age as it would go all
[15:07] the way through until it would come
[15:08] finally a total physical resurrection
[15:11] one day what you see we don't have to
[15:15] wait until that day comes we don't have
[15:19] to say well one of these days there'll
[15:21] be a resurrection no the Prophet is and
[15:26] brother Joe was quoted this morning
[15:28] there he said what a resurrection that
[15:30] was what a resurrection this is
[15:36] something right now present tense we
[15:39] don't have to wait on the resurrection
[15:41] the resurrection started the day he was
[15:44] born again the day you receive the
[15:47] baptism of the Holy Ghost that started
[15:50] your resurrection it also started your
[15:52] rapture because without that being in us
[15:59] there will be no resurrection no rapture
[16:01] for us yes you know you have to have
[16:07] something take place well no I depend
[16:10] upon what took place back there but I
[16:14] want that brought up here and what have
[16:17] I been preaching for months and months
[16:19] what not back not forward look at it now
[16:22] so let's look at the resurrection right
[16:24] now then let's get the resurrection into
[16:28] the right place where it is then then we
[16:31] can say to ebuy said he is risen we
[16:38] don't have to say he has risen that
[16:42] anybody could say it that way
[16:44] proclaim it but to those who have the
[16:48] baptism of the Holy Ghost that new birth
[16:51] within side of you there is the
[16:54] resurrection the rapture and all that we
[16:56] have need of what your prophet said this
[16:59] is everything you have need of than that
[17:01] Holy Ghost when you receive it all we
[17:03] need is to grow develop mature we need a
[17:06] stature of a perfect man we need no sign
[17:08] but you realize that if you
[17:10] started off at faith and ever went any
[17:11] further then you couldn't declare he is
[17:14] risen
[17:14] you would be declaring he has you'd be
[17:17] looking back now you're looking forward
[17:20] to the headstone one day capping
[17:22] everything off and that headstone will
[17:24] be a message come on if it was a message
[17:30] back there that's where everybody's
[17:33] trying to make it some kind of a big
[17:34] thing the message back there he is risen
[17:38] every age has had that same message well
[17:42] what would be the headstone would it not
[17:48] be the same message just a deeper depth
[17:51] and understanding and an opening up of
[17:54] more the word or our bringing in to view
[17:58] and seeing it more clear but what it
[18:01] still not be here is risen
[18:05] these in that way you don't have to
[18:07] worry about what the seals are what this
[18:09] is that it's the message he is risen
[18:14] that's the message that's still here
[18:17] after 2,000 years we still have the same
[18:20] message but if we don't believe it like
[18:25] that now if we believe he was or will be
[18:28] that's not the what the angel said
[18:34] yeah that wasn't the message that was
[18:37] told to them it was told that he is
[18:40] risen because he had declared all the
[18:46] way through his teachings in the gospel
[18:49] and like I said during mark then he
[18:51] taught his doctor and he taught his life
[18:54] and when it finished with the book of
[18:57] Mark what a defense was saying and that
[19:01] he would raise again the third day well
[19:08] we know that's what happened we know he
[19:11] raised the third day huh that's that's
[19:15] fulfillments of the scripture but why
[19:18] would it say that he would rise again
[19:20] the third day that's what Mark said he
[19:26] said he he'd rise again sounding like
[19:30] maybe there's something about this
[19:33] resurrection that did not completely
[19:36] finish up back there and that's what I'm
[19:43] trying to get me and you look at see if
[19:45] we can keep it he is risen it'll come
[19:48] from all the way back there all the way
[19:50] to where we're at and then we have the
[19:54] message and we have the prophets message
[19:58] to declare He is risen because that was
[20:01] his message that he is risen that was
[20:07] that was what went across you know the
[20:08] the world in seven or seven times around
[20:12] the world now preaching what He is risen
[20:17] because he was preaching something that
[20:19] was present tense something that was
[20:22] alive right then and see that baptism of
[20:27] the Holy Ghost being the new birth it is
[20:33] the resurrection inside of you
[20:38] right come on Anais it's it's it's a
[20:43] proof he proved who he was when he
[20:46] raised right he proved who he was when
[20:51] he raised uh-huh
[20:54] see if we have the resurrection then
[20:56] like he did then there's a proof that
[21:01] holy ghost that you have is a proof that
[21:04] he is risen
[21:06] you're not taking what somebody else
[21:08] says see if you say what somebody else
[21:11] says you're just repeating that you're
[21:13] not saying what the word says the word
[21:16] said he is risen
[21:17] right now he is risen he is as always
[21:21] present tense me and that's the way that
[21:26] there's never been nothing else but
[21:28] president all the whole Bible is present
[21:30] tense I am ever present for eternity
[21:40] what about it
[21:42] a simple message a simple thing of
[21:46] thinking about the resurrection but
[21:48] thinking about that it started back
[21:51] there but it will not end until the
[21:54] finality of the resurrection one day
[21:57] they will be a literal resurrection for
[22:02] those that are pi stone but to show you
[22:05] the message is right that he s prayer is
[22:08] as present tense somebody don't have to
[22:12] die teach of some people is not going to
[22:18] be a physical resurrection oh never
[22:24] thought about it like that
[22:25] listen a little bit see some people will
[22:29] never have to have a resurrection why
[22:32] because the resurrection is inside of
[22:34] them it's already there it's not
[22:38] something to you how to see those that
[22:41] are alive and remain they'll be caught
[22:45] up they don't have to raise in the
[22:47] resurrection cuz they don't die
[22:51] why because the new birth started that
[22:54] so positive back there until that soul
[22:57] cannot die and that's why I said it in
[23:00] your resurrection started even if you
[23:04] die if you die your resurrection started
[23:10] back there and one day will climax in a
[23:13] physical resurrection because some
[23:15] people will die and have to be raised
[23:18] the dead in Christ will rise first okay
[23:23] then when that comes forward see then
[23:26] the point of the eternal life dwelling
[23:30] within you and me
[23:32] can declare the whole thing is finished
[23:37] that's that's that's what I'm trying to
[23:39] get you to see that's when that brother
[23:41] asked me what my my point was or what I
[23:43] was aiming at I'm aiming at a positive
[23:46] total present tense eternity right now
[23:51] the day you receive the baptism of the
[23:53] Holy Ghost the rapture set in in your
[23:56] heart and soul sure physically we need a
[23:59] lot of things we need to growth
[24:01] developments we need all of the things
[24:03] yes we need the adoptions we need the
[24:05] Statue of perfect man we need to
[24:07] teaching of the word we need to seal the
[24:08] opening to it we need all of those
[24:10] things yes but it started back that
[24:14] without the baptism with the Holy Ghost
[24:17] it wouldn't make no you know nothing
[24:18] else wouldn't be worth anything but see
[24:24] we have it already set within us and we
[24:28] have proof
[24:32] right now we are proof that heroes back
[24:38] there we are proof that he raised well
[24:45] you know one of them people you know
[24:47] everybody talks about it he raised but
[24:54] let me ask you a question with him
[24:57] putting it into the resurrection why are
[25:01] they looking for the Lord to come why
[25:05] are you looking for the Lord to come
[25:10] well he said he's coming ninety said
[25:15] he's here he's resident he's here oh
[25:21] yeah we know we have to but I'm if
[25:24] you're getting the point and listen what
[25:26] I'm saying you saved it up the people
[25:28] are preaching around the world today
[25:30] because you know and I'm not making
[25:32] remarks or anything but because of the
[25:35] situation worldwide and way things are
[25:39] going there was probably as money since
[25:41] they can on the churches were full today
[25:44] preachers on the radio preachers doing
[25:47] as we're doing broadcasting the message
[25:49] out doing all of those things yes and
[25:52] probably a whole lot more than they was
[25:54] like sister a lot more talking about to
[25:58] the things that we need sincerely to be
[26:01] you know right now we need to get
[26:03] serious we need to get desperate because
[26:05] look at what all these things is taking
[26:07] place well that's good that's what I'm
[26:08] saying
[26:09] but is that all that it is is the fact
[26:12] that you're afraid are you afraid of
[26:18] dying if you're afraid of dying you
[26:21] don't have the Living one within you but
[26:25] if you if you don't have the Living one
[26:28] in here you help automatically be afraid
[26:30] of dying now there's a part like
[26:32] somebody said the other day about it you
[26:34] there's a part about death that we don't
[26:36] understand yeah
[26:37] there's a fear situation in there
[26:40] brother Louise talking about Wednesday
[26:42] there's a situation within that fear
[26:45] that yes we don't understand the death
[26:49] and the burial the resurrection the way
[26:51] we need to and we won't forget it fully
[26:54] until it's finished then it'll be done
[26:57] then we'll understand well yet there's
[27:00] no need of being there's not any theater
[27:02] to that thing with the baptism of the
[27:07] Holy Ghost you shouldn't be afraid of
[27:09] anything because he's the one on which
[27:13] the church mr. who I'm saying what a
[27:16] resurrection the Prophet said we'll get
[27:17] to that in a second that was back there
[27:19] what a resurrection this is see he
[27:23] proved the message to be true by raising
[27:28] from the dead he stood there in in the
[27:32] Gospels and declared what would take
[27:35] place right go back and read your
[27:39] Gospels of thing he declared what would
[27:41] transfer you know what would take place
[27:43] in in the day all right
[27:50] well what if that had never happened you
[27:55] say well the you just bring up the
[27:57] impossibilities
[27:58] no I'm bringing up the truth I'm asking
[28:04] you can you say he is risen can you say
[28:10] it from within you are just literal
[28:12] words somebody else's say it can you
[28:16] declare that's not like that's all the
[28:18] hope I have all the hope I haven't
[28:20] anything it's a resurrection of the Lord
[28:22] Jesus we have no hope in the world look
[28:26] at it stroke of a pen where the whole
[28:29] world not just one nation this has never
[28:32] been like this there never been a time
[28:35] when the whole world even when you'd say
[28:38] World War one everybody didn't go to war
[28:41] world war two everybody didn't go to war
[28:44] there was countries that had nothing to
[28:47] do with a lot of that yeah but you see
[28:52] now it's the whole worldwide
[28:56] and since driving people assure to their
[29:00] knees in a tort - that to me is the
[29:02] purpose of it people turn down the
[29:08] message now you look what's taking place
[29:13] now get what I'm saying I'm just meaning
[29:15] this point where just to get you to look
[29:17] at something that's hurts right over
[29:19] there they hadn't turned down the
[29:20] message code Elton Norton body right the
[29:24] most of the churches know nothing about
[29:26] this message think turned the message
[29:28] down we see it a lot of people have
[29:32] turned the message down you know that's
[29:35] what brought the plague that's what
[29:40] brought the plague was the people of
[29:42] this message turning down the message
[29:46] and see then the only way that's gonna
[29:49] be done he's like wait was talking about
[29:50] you got to get gonna you've got to find
[29:54] a way to get uh what was his name took
[29:57] the censer went among the people Aaron
[30:01] we said well brother branham was the
[30:03] Prophet and all I can yeah but he's not
[30:05] here now to take a sensor and run among
[30:08] the people okay
[30:12] no disrespect to your thoughts or
[30:15] whatever all right we'll see something's
[30:17] got to happen well I'm like this the
[30:21] only way I can see that it can happen is
[30:24] for the people the bright people to
[30:26] realize who they are and what they're
[30:29] here for
[30:33] we're here to proclaim the message what
[30:36] he is risen
[30:38] oh we've been doing that for 2,000 years
[30:41] well why hasn't he raised it's not being
[30:48] declared by the way it's being declared
[30:51] he has or will or something it's not
[30:54] saying he is risen
[30:56] see that's what I'm getting try to get
[30:59] you to see the proof he raised proved
[31:02] who he was by you receiving the baptism
[31:05] of the holy ghost proved he was a child
[31:08] of God
[31:11] alright proved that you were were
[31:16] elected and and all like that you can go
[31:19] through all of the thing proved it
[31:22] because it was is who we are and all
[31:27] he's doing is waiting on us to realize
[31:28] who we are and then when we do we can
[31:33] see the day in the hour we're living ok
[31:37] proof of the resurrection is the message
[31:42] that we have see if you have a bygone
[31:46] days and that's in your future message
[31:47] you're not you're not in the message I
[31:51] don't care if you can quote you can say
[31:54] everything you got all the books you got
[31:56] all the tapes you you know but if it's
[31:59] not something personal then it's not the
[32:02] message the Prophet was bringing because
[32:04] he was bringing a message to prove that
[32:07] he is risen
[32:10] well now think about it see Jesus proved
[32:16] the fact of him coming forth alive that
[32:26] he was the resurrection but that didn't
[32:30] end it all because you see when he came
[32:34] forth
[32:34] had it been just him raising and nothing
[32:37] else taking place look where you would
[32:41] be but instead of that he raised and
[32:46] when he raised he come right back in the
[32:51] baptism with the Holy Ghost there's the
[32:54] message that brings us alive he came
[33:01] forth isn't alive he brings forth us
[33:03] alive all right the baptism of the Holy
[33:06] Ghost is proof that direction the
[33:11] resurrection has already passed
[33:16] the resurrection being already passed
[33:19] already being something that was was
[33:20] done it's proof by you be able to
[33:24] receive eternal life and the baptism of
[33:28] the Holy Ghost see then the proof of the
[33:34] resurrection we have that this now to
[33:37] where we can say he is risen and like I
[33:43] said now see when you get to the point
[33:46] of seeing that he has risen the correct
[33:49] way then you'll see the seals is broke
[33:52] all the things are unveiled and the word
[33:54] is undone because that's the message the
[33:57] message is the message of eternal life
[34:01] no one ever spoke like this man did in
[34:03] the last days about eternal life I'm
[34:06] talking about in the time you know in
[34:07] the hour that was what caught me because
[34:10] I was looking for things I was desiring
[34:13] things from God and searching for it but
[34:16] when I heard a man talking about what I
[34:21] had experienced of seeing God and the
[34:26] things in him what he could do that was
[34:29] worse than the message become alive the
[34:32] message is not a quote it's something
[34:39] that's alive now think about it see he
[34:47] raised in the resurrection but he came
[34:51] back into the church to bring her that
[34:55] same resurrection right to bring her the
[35:01] bennet and make her the beneficiary
[35:03] wherever how you said of that
[35:04] resurrection if you'll study the message
[35:06] it is the rising of the Sun see then
[35:10] you'll understand why he said
[35:14] now if you look at it and see the church
[35:16] coming into view you know all right
[35:20] the church the bride coming into view
[35:22] all right then you can understand why he
[35:25] said all right said I'm gonna do this
[35:28] I'm gonna have to die and said I know
[35:32] there he didn't say that when somebody
[35:33] else was writing it because I said what
[35:36] he was saying but listen he said I'm
[35:41] simplifying language I'm gonna raise
[35:44] again now there he stood right there you
[35:54] stood he was the resurrection had done
[35:57] taken place but yet back over there
[36:02] before he come to there he knew what he
[36:05] would do and he's speaking in mark a
[36:08] good time before the Easter sonrise
[36:13] morning and he says and after three days
[36:17] Allah raised again again why would it
[36:22] use the word again it's simply it's sin
[36:24] seemingly implies that there's two
[36:29] resurrections because he had already
[36:34] raised there he stood he is risen he's
[36:38] here but away before the end he had
[36:41] already told him what he would do that
[36:46] he would rise again well why would it
[36:55] use it in those terminologies there's
[36:59] not two resurrections but there's a
[37:03] resurrection in many parts are what
[37:07] would you call it many many it would
[37:13] take a lot of it to include it because
[37:17] now listen that's what I would like for
[37:19] you to do sometimes when you get time to
[37:21] read through a little bit right at mark
[37:23] and read around
[37:24] that mark 8:31 and just look at it of
[37:30] the way he's saying it he's saying I
[37:34] dishonor man that's what I said yeah I
[37:40] try to make sure you don't get lost into
[37:43] it don't turn over the mark and say it's
[37:45] not hidden red-letter well there's a
[37:49] whole lot from Genesis to revelations
[37:52] it's not in red letter are you gonna
[37:54] take all that out if you do you got a
[37:57] very thin Bible alright get what I'm
[38:01] saying he stands there and throughout
[38:06] his whole message he declared that he
[38:09] was God the Son of man he declared all
[38:17] those things and he declared what would
[38:20] happen to this son of man and when he
[38:25] gets over to the point he comes from
[38:28] dier he comes from Genesis 1 with the
[38:33] son of man and he comes over and he says
[38:36] and then I'm all raised again that's
[38:42] looking at him as well what do you mean
[38:46] you just raised he said I'm gonna rise
[38:53] again
[38:53] alright now listen the argument between
[38:57] the pharisees and sadducees my
[38:58] understanding was that the Pharisees
[39:01] believed in the resurrection the
[39:02] Sadducees didn't believe in one night so
[39:04] they argue their point backwards before
[39:06] all right but that's what I'm asking you
[39:08] is it just an argument
[39:12] when he said I'll rise again could he
[39:19] not have been looking to the life stage
[39:25] physically there will be a resurrection
[39:29] come on I'm a Pharisee okay physically
[39:32] that will be a resurrection Sadducees
[39:38] huh
[39:39] no he's already done it he's always done
[39:42] is that done no Jesus was covered feel
[39:47] getting my point if you just read it he
[39:49] was covering from Genesis to write
[39:52] exactly where he would raise which would
[39:54] be sometime later from where he said
[39:56] that and Mark all right follow that
[40:00] point of what I'm talking about
[40:03] when you follow that point then you will
[40:05] see that there are strange things spoken
[40:09] in I guess you call it odd strange ways
[40:14] to hide it from the wise and prudent but
[40:18] that it would reveal it to the babes in
[40:21] other words were the bad ones with the
[40:22] baptism of the Holy Ghost it could be
[40:23] revealed to a rock and see strange
[40:28] things are said throughout the Bible
[40:33] I remember who is in a Baptist Church we
[40:35] used to talk about the the first
[40:37] resurrection
[40:39] you know the second resurrections and
[40:42] the things like that and
[40:44] and I want you to just start with me and
[40:47] the ease up through something and think
[40:49] about what's being said go ahead and
[40:50] pull up number one because you'll get it
[40:53] from revelations 20 verse 5 but the rest
[41:01] of the Dead lived not again until the
[41:04] thousand years were finished now listen
[41:07] to his statement this is the first
[41:13] resurrection the ability for somebody to
[41:19] live a thousand years because of the
[41:25] fall back there and nobody's ever lived
[41:27] that but somebody would live that
[41:29] thousand years and it would be called
[41:33] then was this is the first resurrection
[41:36] now watch him blessed and holy is he
[41:39] that hath part in the first resurrection
[41:44] on such the second death have no power
[41:52] but he shall be but they shall be
[41:56] priests and of God in Christ and shall
[41:58] reign with him a thousand years they
[42:01] some 1000 years here two thousand here -
[42:03] laughing back and forth looks like but
[42:06] he's not he's explaining exactly what
[42:07] he's talking about
[42:09] there's going to be a thousand year
[42:12] millennial reign to prove the sin curse
[42:16] is taken off somebody will it won't be
[42:19] me and you we don't have to do that but
[42:23] those people will be able to live a
[42:25] thousand years exist that period of time
[42:28] because of something that happens with
[42:31] us see the baptism with the Holy Ghost
[42:36] is the first resurrection right come on
[42:41] that simple the baptism of the Holy
[42:42] Ghost there's a first resurrection
[42:44] you're gonna live the thousand years
[42:47] millennial reign right not because you
[42:52] got to the part that has to to food
[42:55] through the sin curses go is for
[42:58] somebody physically to live it and they
[43:00] will human people will the Jews the
[43:03] millennium will be for them and they'll
[43:05] live a thousand years to prove the sin
[43:07] curse is taken off what do you think
[43:11] we're gonna be we're gonna be right
[43:18] there with them but not in physical
[43:24] bodies like dirt bodies were you know we
[43:28] already be in a glorified body
[43:30] we've been body spirit and soul eternal
[43:32] and we can stay there why because we
[43:35] already have right here the first
[43:37] resurrection we don't know how to wait
[43:40] though they're people we'll have to wait
[43:42] till the time comes they'll be given
[43:45] life to be able to live a thousand years
[43:49] but we don't have to do that cuz we
[43:51] already have the first resurrection over
[43:53] which the second death hath no part you
[43:58] know how no power you realize the
[44:01] baptism of the Holy Ghost you got in you
[44:03] are you scared of this thing out here of
[44:09] all of these plagues of things humanly
[44:12] speaking yes there's Jitterbugs if that
[44:15] come when things are saying sure that's
[44:18] that's human that's that part we're
[44:20] talking about a minute ago
[44:22] but listen
[44:25] I'm not afraid of dying why cuz I
[44:30] already died I'm promised if I die I go
[44:38] to the grave but I promise the
[44:41] resurrection and I can go to the grave
[44:45] saying he is risen because one day it'll
[44:49] take place the devil has no power the
[44:54] perfect love casts out fear
[44:56] he's brother lluís was on group wins -
[44:59] yeah fear hath torment it bothers you
[45:03] yes and it's humanly sure but why would
[45:09] you be afraid that's what's wrong with
[45:17] the people of that's what I've tried to
[45:19] get people to see about it and I know
[45:20] it's been misunderstood but people want
[45:24] to scare their children with an eternal
[45:27] God that hates them wants them to live
[45:30] good wants them to do it's good to want
[45:32] them to live and want them to do but
[45:35] what make it a fear will not make it
[45:39] love well it's hard to tell them that
[45:43] God's gonna love them and he's gonna
[45:44] kill him
[45:46] he ain't gonna kill him if I kill do we
[45:50] kill ourselves but get what I'm saying
[45:58] Jesus was actually saying I've taught
[46:02] you all of my time with him
[46:07] but said I'm gonna have to be killed
[46:12] unless you know what's right he says
[46:16] don't fret don't be afraid he's because
[46:18] I'm gonna rise again all right now he
[46:26] said a statement that is outstanding
[46:28] when he said I am the resurrection and
[46:31] the life
[46:34] see he was standing there looking all
[46:37] the way through over pipes to us to the
[46:39] end of all things and there'll be a
[46:41] resurrection even the sinner will have
[46:44] to be raised everybody brother Ron said
[46:47] we'll have a resurrection see one of
[46:50] them is into two you know eternity and
[46:55] things like that bringing your body and
[46:58] the different things and connecting it
[46:59] together yeah but some they're gonna
[47:02] have to raise and go to the white throne
[47:04] and stuff like that
[47:06] everybody's gonna raise cuz that's the
[47:10] point except to those that are alive and
[47:12] remain that don't there's B that don't
[47:15] go they don't have to raise that's the
[47:17] wonderful thing to me and you and here's
[47:20] the point now they without us cannot be
[47:22] made perfect so the pool is going to
[47:25] come from the ones that are so anchored
[47:27] into Christ into that Holy Ghost until
[47:30] they're not going to die right do you
[47:34] believe that's going to happen according
[47:36] to the Bible there's going to be that
[47:38] somebody know how to die well they're
[47:42] waiting on the ones that know how to die
[47:44] I mean that's who I'm right now if I
[47:50] have to die I'm waiting on the ones that
[47:52] don't have to die no I've already
[47:55] studied the story out and I realize all
[47:58] I got to do is just be a part of that
[48:01] group in some way connecting to eternal
[48:07] life
[48:09] and then I see this message that it
[48:12] unfolds and things that is it's brought
[48:14] forth and I see your prophet talking
[48:19] about things like I said everybody
[48:21] everybody understand now my point see
[48:24] the first resurrection it's the baptism
[48:26] of the Holy Ghost the second
[48:32] resurrection you know how to worry about
[48:34] that cause you ain't gonna be no part of
[48:36] it second resurrection is the center
[48:38] dated but that ain't where he's talking
[48:42] about is gonna rise again no what's he
[48:45] talking about
[48:47] that's brother Branham said will o those
[48:53] without the baptism when the Holy Ghost
[48:56] will he be lost
[48:58] he said no listen if a person dies
[49:05] without the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[49:06] will he be lost now listen to him listen
[49:09] what he's saying no if he's a believer
[49:14] he'll come in the resurrection the
[49:17] second resurrection he's a believer he
[49:23] comes in not the first resurrection so
[49:25] right make him a believer he's no no no
[49:26] he ain't believing enough and look if
[49:33] he's got the baptism of Holy Ghost he'll
[49:36] go in the first resurrection sea over
[49:41] which the second death hath no part okay
[49:46] so there will be I'm looking for a
[49:48] resurrection yes but I believe the
[49:53] resurrection is already here within me
[49:55] and you okay let's let Paul make an
[50:02] outstanding statement I hope I don't get
[50:04] too long hey we got all days I worry
[50:06] about this one service we think look at
[50:10] what brother look at what Paul says I
[50:13] want you to pay very close attention go
[50:15] to number five which is Philippians
[50:21] now listen to a man that at this period
[50:26] of time then he starts speaking you
[50:30] could look up the dates or whatever the
[50:31] time he's already received the new birth
[50:36] he's already went back and come back out
[50:40] with the word and the things you know in
[50:43] other words he's already will just put
[50:45] it in my language of that's where he's
[50:47] come up the stature of a perfect man
[50:48] he's coming through those things he's
[50:51] getting into situations of understanding
[50:54] you know he's talked to Peter named he
[50:57] then own the stature of perfect man he
[50:59] knows about it he's in adoptions now
[51:02] listen to Paul and listen to what he
[51:06] says causes as it was I said Jesus
[51:11] looked like he was saying I'm gonna rise
[51:14] again well remember he was standing
[51:19] there and hadn't raised the first time
[51:24] right I'm talking about mark where I was
[51:27] reading that know where the scriptures
[51:29] we go now listen to what Paul comes up
[51:32] yeah doubtless doubtless and I count all
[51:35] things but loss for the excellency of
[51:37] the knowledge of Jesus of Christ Jesus
[51:39] my Lord for whom I have suffered the
[51:42] loss of many things and do count them
[51:44] but dung that I may win Christ and be
[51:47] found in him not having my own
[51:51] righteousness which is of the law but
[51:53] that which is through the faith of
[51:55] Christ the righteousness which is of God
[51:57] by faith now a man with a great ability
[52:02] the great position he was stand-in
[52:06] in theologies and could talk to you
[52:10] about anything in connecting the old
[52:12] testament to the new and and all of the
[52:14] things and come in with the new birth
[52:16] and standing there talking look what he
[52:20] says that i may know him and the power
[52:27] of his resurrection Oh Paul you're
[52:31] already born again what are you doing
[52:34] I'm trying to get you to look at
[52:36] something I want you to understand
[52:39] something that I may know him you mean
[52:42] you don't know him you already gotten
[52:43] here yes I do
[52:45] but there's more to it than just to say
[52:48] the new birth there's a growth
[52:51] development there's the stature there's
[52:53] an adoption there's all of the things
[52:55] that goes with it now listen to what he
[52:57] says in the power of his resurrection
[52:59] and the Fellowship of his suffering
[53:01] being made conformable unto his death if
[53:03] by any means I might attain unto the
[53:07] resurrection of the Dead all
[53:18] what kind of language you're using what
[53:24] are you saying you you have the new
[53:29] birth you're not into all of that law
[53:36] teaching deals of all of the days and
[53:38] the life you straighten all of that out
[53:39] and Galatians and the Corinthians I yeah
[53:44] what do you mean if by any means in
[53:50] other words I'm longing for something
[53:54] undesirable to the resurrection of the
[53:59] Dead he's already in the first
[54:02] resurrection by the baptism of the Holy
[54:04] Ghost
[54:05] he has no worry of death he has no way
[54:10] that the second death can bother him
[54:12] arena what do you talk about Paul you
[54:18] sound like that you you you sound like
[54:21] you're playing in one word that you're
[54:23] you've got the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[54:25] and you're you're up in the heart with
[54:27] the Apostles and dying and said but now
[54:29] looks like you're saying well you know I
[54:31] don't know whether I'm gonna be there
[54:32] not he said no that's okay read the next
[54:43] verse not as though I had already
[54:50] attained now he looks like he's doubting
[54:58] either we're already perfect now he's
[55:00] explaining truth where he was standing
[55:04] Paul was standing at a place that he
[55:07] needed something to happen to bring him
[55:09] to perfection with a heaven Newberg yeah
[55:16] but he didn't have the in down message
[55:17] I'll just set that away okay not as
[55:24] though I had already a time in other
[55:25] words Jesus is he's saying I'm not where
[55:27] I want to be
[55:31] I want to attain unto the resurrection
[55:37] of the Dead well probably you're scared
[55:40] you ain't going right no that ain't what
[55:43] I'm talking about I think what I'm
[55:48] trying to bring not as though had
[55:51] already attained I said I have an attack
[55:55] yet to the through this position that I
[55:58] won't but I'm not lost but I'm not
[56:05] perfect I'm not complete not as though
[56:14] had already attained either we're
[56:16] already perfect but I follow after press
[56:20] toward the mark of the prize of the high
[56:23] calling in Christ Jesus if that I may
[56:26] app may apprehend for that which also I
[56:31] am apprehended of cross Jesus brethren I
[56:35] count not myself to have apprehended you
[56:41] you're not where you want to be no he's
[56:44] not worried want to be he's not worried
[56:49] wanted to be I'm not where I want to be
[56:52] are you where you want to be I'm glad to
[56:55] be where I'm at I'm cherish the point
[56:58] I'm glad were a mass but I'm not happy
[57:00] where I'm at because I see something
[57:06] else I see what's bothering me but I
[57:15] can't knock myself to have apprehended
[57:16] with this one thing I do forgetting
[57:18] those things which are behind and
[57:20] reaching forth unto that think those
[57:24] things which are before I press toward
[57:27] the mark for the prize of the high
[57:29] calling and God in Christ Jesus
[57:31] I press toward the perfection that I
[57:35] want now thank
[57:40] it said I'm glad we've got a profit due
[57:45] that way wasn't asked the profit okay so
[57:51] I'm asking brother Branham brother
[57:54] Branham you're supposed to be the profit
[57:57] you're supposed to lead us through you
[57:58] supposed to be ologist now you're the
[58:02] one that all this is to come to to help
[58:04] us to understand the word and what's
[58:07] wrong with Paulo one minute he looks
[58:10] like he's as perfect as can be in his
[58:12] glory in a minute and then the next
[58:13] minute he's he's saying I'm not where I
[58:15] want to be I want to be somewhere that I
[58:21] want something else to happen but yet
[58:25] look at him
[58:26] other as we call him for his day the
[58:29] Prophet would say for his day he was the
[58:31] greatest height of all the apostles
[58:33] wouldn't you agree without her I mean he
[58:36] was no different in them but yet he he
[58:39] was to the the Gentiles to the people he
[58:46] was a messenger to the church age look
[58:48] all the things the great Apostle Paul
[58:50] was yet he's saying I'm still not where
[58:53] I want to be now let me lay a little bit
[58:59] in here do you think that Paul would be
[59:01] waiting on you if you don't then you're
[59:05] not getting the point of I'm talking
[59:07] about Paul's waiting on me in you that's
[59:13] what he's talking about that's what he's
[59:17] talking about here he's talking about
[59:19] now I'd like to find a place that I
[59:25] could attain unto a resurrection of the
[59:31] dead nothing I haven't already attained
[59:36] in the new birth neither that not saying
[59:40] that I'm not where I want to be in
[59:42] Christ but saying I'm not where I want
[59:45] to be I want more
[59:50] I want more go ahead to number five and
[59:55] let's just read and see what your
[59:56] prophet says this is talking about they
[59:59] remember what he said if by any means I
[1:00:01] might attain unto the resurrection of
[1:00:04] the dead now what's he talking about go
[1:00:07] ahead brothers pull up number six which
[1:00:12] is taken from the sardian Church H wrote
[1:00:17] Iran opens and you can read those things
[1:00:18] and you are you go if by any means I
[1:00:21] might attain to the resurrection of the
[1:00:23] Dead now this statement is most peculiar
[1:00:26] we all know that we are all going to be
[1:00:31] in a resurrection whether we want to be
[1:00:35] or not all will be resurrected so Paul
[1:00:39] could hardly be saying if by any means I
[1:00:43] might attain to a resurrection of the
[1:00:45] Dead because that's not what he's saying
[1:00:48] that's what he said that ain't what he
[1:00:50] say it right that's the words he used if
[1:00:55] by any means I might attain unto the
[1:00:57] resurrection look at the Prophet
[1:00:59] so Paul could hardly be saying if by any
[1:01:03] means I might attain to a resurrection
[1:01:06] of the dead the truth of the matter is
[1:01:08] he is not saying that he's not saying
[1:01:13] what's your reading that he's saying you
[1:01:18] know that's crazy no you got to get into
[1:01:20] what I was saying about the Lord Jesus
[1:01:22] there's a lot of things that are stated
[1:01:25] when Jesus said that he might rise again
[1:01:28] he hadn't even raised yet and he looks
[1:01:32] like there's more to cover the
[1:01:33] resurrection there is and was at the
[1:01:36] time he was standing there listen to
[1:01:38] Paul the literal reading is if by any
[1:01:43] means I might attain to the out
[1:01:47] resurrection from among the dead
[1:01:55] the
[1:01:57] resurrection he's not trying to be in
[1:02:07] any way raised or not listen this is not
[1:02:12] the attaining to the general or second
[1:02:15] resurrection who you know Pauline will
[1:02:17] be there but attaining to the first
[1:02:20] resurrection it's something pertaining
[1:02:24] to your resurrection that you want to be
[1:02:27] Paul to be attained to an out
[1:02:30] resurrection out of what okay this is
[1:02:40] not the attaining to the general or
[1:02:42] second resurrection but attaining to the
[1:02:45] first resurrection of which it is said
[1:02:47] blessed and holy is he who has part in
[1:02:50] the first resurrection on such the
[1:02:52] second death has no part but they shall
[1:02:55] be priests of God and of Christ and
[1:02:57] shall reign with him a thousand years
[1:03:00] the first resurrection has nothing to do
[1:03:03] with the second he goes into what we
[1:03:05] come but want to go Paul what do you say
[1:03:08] an out resurrection
[1:03:19] from among the dead now Paul's walking
[1:03:27] around with people they're walking and
[1:03:33] talking into eating as I but as far as
[1:03:36] he's concerned they're dead and probably
[1:03:44] said I don't want to be left here with
[1:03:48] this book is dead people the nomination
[1:03:54] aliy did all the rest this is the end
[1:04:05] this is at the end of the thousand years
[1:04:08] when all the rest of the dead live again
[1:04:12] and in that day there will be those who
[1:04:15] come forward to eternal life
[1:04:17] so he's explaining it listen out
[1:04:21] resurrection out from denominationalism
[1:04:26] but but wait a minute Paul didn't know
[1:04:28] Paul that's Paul's trouble that's what
[1:04:30] people's trouble was
[1:04:32] but Paul recognized it Paul said I've
[1:04:36] got problems he said I've been born
[1:04:40] again I've come through these things and
[1:04:43] I'm I don't count it don't brag on
[1:04:45] myself but set a price myself above the
[1:04:47] Apostles because I've come up to that
[1:04:51] place and ain't none of them added he
[1:04:55] said one word to them is that his word
[1:04:59] all said none of them added one word to
[1:05:02] him pretty good place to be standing but
[1:05:10] he said still there's a bunch of dead
[1:05:11] people here now bring that down to where
[1:05:16] we are now and you'll see the things and
[1:05:20] you'll see why brother Branham said what
[1:05:23] he did they're going together with what
[1:05:26] we've been talking about
[1:05:29] a resurrection you realize the day you
[1:05:35] was born again and us brought down your
[1:05:38] new birth started the growth development
[1:05:42] statue a perfect man etc but see we're
[1:05:46] not happy we're not pleased with it we
[1:05:49] want more of what we've got that was
[1:05:52] Paul's idea then when he called it to
[1:05:55] out resurrection he was just simply
[1:05:57] saying out from among the dead you
[1:06:01] realize I'm not throwing no stones for
[1:06:03] nothing do you realize that the bride of
[1:06:06] Jesus Christ is walking in the world of
[1:06:08] dead people there's a lot of people in
[1:06:12] that dead people that's gonna get to
[1:06:14] heaven one day so we're not going off on
[1:06:16] nobody
[1:06:17] there's the foolish virgins there's the
[1:06:19] Jews there's all kind of groups a lot
[1:06:21] more than they are of us that's gonna
[1:06:24] get to heaven so we're not throwing off
[1:06:25] on nobody but just being plain to the
[1:06:33] little bride that understands what
[1:06:35] you're here for and what we're doing see
[1:06:42] then you're having an out resurrection
[1:06:45] you realize the day you're born again
[1:06:47] you had an out resurrection you realize
[1:06:50] that out resurrection is still taking
[1:06:51] place as that word is being unveiled to
[1:06:54] us and unfolding and keeps on unfolding
[1:06:57] it is an out resurrection you see why
[1:07:00] that I'm so hard and strong I know and I
[1:07:03] beat it and not like that of trying to
[1:07:05] get people to study the seals the
[1:07:07] seventy weeks of Daniel the the marriage
[1:07:11] and divorce the the message of the hour
[1:07:13] to see are we still caught in dead
[1:07:17] denominationalism let's see is it rising
[1:07:20] her son what brother Ron said he said
[1:07:22] I'm afraid that we're not getting the
[1:07:24] people that Jesus Christ we're getting
[1:07:26] them to doctrines and ideas but we're
[1:07:29] not getting them he said to Jesus Christ
[1:07:33] why because we're not doing this Paul
[1:07:36] struggling to have an out resurrection
[1:07:39] out from among the dead
[1:07:44] we're not trying to leave these things
[1:07:46] no but get from out among the dead okay
[1:07:52] now let me say just a word or two about
[1:07:55] this other part doctor see when Jesus
[1:07:59] said he would raise again I asked the
[1:08:01] question I asked it again
[1:08:03] could he have been looking from back
[1:08:05] there in Genesis all the way to the Book
[1:08:08] of Revelations and finally I found a lot
[1:08:11] is it in the resurrection sea then he
[1:08:18] would be raised and again he's gonna
[1:08:19] raise again the life stage not in a
[1:08:21] natural resurrection Coast he don't need
[1:08:23] one he don't need a natural resurrection
[1:08:27] you and I are the ones gonna be he don't
[1:08:29] need one even in the end of thing but if
[1:08:31] you're not out we're gonna need a
[1:08:33] natural resurrection if we don't die
[1:08:37] you're going to have to get out of that
[1:08:40] out resident into that powers in the out
[1:08:43] resurrection out away from our
[1:08:47] denominational ideas and opinions of
[1:08:50] this message and what we believe about
[1:08:52] it and what we've called it this and
[1:08:54] called it that instead of taking it for
[1:08:56] what he's saying and letting God speak
[1:08:59] to us the brother branham on this arise
[1:09:07] another son I won't get to it over this
[1:09:09] makes a statement he said there's going
[1:09:14] to be a resurrection in the last days
[1:09:17] from according to melikhaya for Luke 17
[1:09:21] 30 what kind of resurrection not a
[1:09:28] physical that's already done it's
[1:09:32] already stamped seals that we're going
[1:09:34] to have everybody's gonna have a
[1:09:35] resurrection those who don go down are
[1:09:37] gonna be resurrected but those who don't
[1:09:39] have to die
[1:09:42] they'll have to have a resurrection but
[1:09:45] they've got to walk in the light to get
[1:09:47] out of that out resurrection has got to
[1:09:51] be applied to us to get away from our
[1:09:54] own ideas and thoughts at what we think
[1:09:56] it is to get down to what it is and
[1:09:58] saying well the Prophet said it he said
[1:10:01] that to be a out resurrection of what
[1:10:08] from the denominational ideas that we
[1:10:11] have and that sheath we'll get back to
[1:10:15] it
[1:10:15] that shieff is to be waived he said it's
[1:10:18] to be waived again that sheaf was waived
[1:10:21] back there because Jesus raised from the
[1:10:23] dead he was waived over the church
[1:10:27] ascended up on high come back and waived
[1:10:31] under there Pentecost in the baptism of
[1:10:33] the Holy Ghost to bring the new birth
[1:10:36] that's to happen again when it comes to
[1:10:39] the headstone the finality of this life
[1:10:41] days there is to be another refilling of
[1:10:43] the Holy Ghost yes there is to be those
[1:10:48] things in the last days because it's to
[1:10:50] the people who realize what's taking
[1:10:52] place and then that sheaf is to be waved
[1:10:55] from according to Malachi 4
[1:11:00] according to Luke 1730
[1:11:06] in other words bread around home axes
[1:11:09] that's what we'll get to we'll get to
[1:11:11] come back into this pick up a little bit
[1:11:13] and he says there will be a message read
[1:11:19] it from Chrysler from its rising the Sun
[1:11:21] didn't we'll get back he said they will
[1:11:23] be a message swing forth and here he is
[1:11:31] in 65 I think it's right on this and
[1:11:40] he's talking about something to come and
[1:11:44] it looks like to a lot that he's
[1:11:47] doubting what has already come
[1:11:49] no he's explaining one thing if you'll
[1:11:55] read it this away he's explaining Jesus
[1:11:57] Christ rose and was waived then that
[1:12:00] Holy Ghost came on the day of Pentecost
[1:12:02] and it went down through 7 Church ages
[1:12:05] and it went into the nomination ilysm
[1:12:07] etc etc then we must have an out
[1:12:09] resurrection to get out of that we must
[1:12:11] get out of that of our own selves and
[1:12:13] you know in our being design and come
[1:12:15] forth with that sheaf to be waved again
[1:12:17] in the last day sure brother branham was
[1:12:19] the first to come to maturity I agree
[1:12:21] with that wholeheartedly he was picked
[1:12:23] up and waved over you and I to show what
[1:12:26] is to come but you know what
[1:12:32] I'm gonna say it honestly one chief
[1:12:36] won't feed the world one chief is just a
[1:12:41] handful is that all you want no I want
[1:12:47] the whole field
[1:12:48] I want what it's out there for me to
[1:12:51] live off of
[1:12:52] I want the Word of God brother Branham
[1:12:55] brought the Word of God and receive wave
[1:12:57] in there overs ride but now that must
[1:13:00] come into you and me if not we need an
[1:13:04] out resurrection that's what we need we
[1:13:07] need an out resurrection out of our own
[1:13:12] ideas and thoughts see he says there is
[1:13:16] to be a message missing in the first
[1:13:20] time there will come forth for the bride
[1:13:23] age for a resurrection out of dark
[1:13:28] denominationalism will be a message
[1:13:34] that the full maturity of the word has
[1:13:38] turned back again in its full power and
[1:13:41] being waved over the people by the same
[1:13:44] signs and wonders than he did back there
[1:13:50] see so he's gonna raise again and then
[1:13:55] it's odd the way he says it harder how
[1:13:56] that the Bible is for three days was the
[1:14:01] Bible say after 2,000 years in the third
[1:14:06] day is that the scripture something's to
[1:14:11] happen in the third day because our for
[1:14:15] the message is to come alive in you and
[1:14:17] me okay come on musician get too much to
[1:14:23] try to put it in but we're gonna get
[1:14:24] into the chief wave and what we're gonna
[1:14:27] try to get into that sheath wave is to
[1:14:29] find out some strange statements brother
[1:14:32] Branham made are like he said that Mary
[1:14:35] was not the seed she was just a carrier
[1:14:39] well that would mean Azusa Street was
[1:14:41] false
[1:14:42] no I mean what he's talking about he's
[1:14:47] telling it like it is he's bringing that
[1:14:49] forth we're supposed to be those seed
[1:14:54] was in Mary and birthed out entire stood
[1:15:01] the word if Mary representative looser
[1:15:05] Street and that's what the Prophet said
[1:15:06] she did then okay there's got to be a
[1:15:11] people that become the seed not to give
[1:15:18] birth to it that's part of the story but
[1:15:24] to become the very seed itself out of
[1:15:29] dark denominationalism a resurrection
[1:15:32] now do you see why the Prophet said what
[1:15:35] a resurrection that was what a
[1:15:37] resurrection this is to realize what
[1:15:39] we've got to do it's not that we have a
[1:15:43] choice of doing or in no it's got to be
[1:15:45] done if not then we call keep waiting on
[1:15:47] each other with somebody is going to
[1:15:50] come to the place and be like Paul he
[1:15:57] said I want an out resurrection I'm
[1:16:01] happy where I'm at don't try to take
[1:16:03] that away but I want some mower right
[1:16:07] let's tan thank own these things what a
[1:16:13] resurrection that would what a
[1:16:15] resurrection is he is until that's all I
[1:17:13] want you
[1:17:14] [Music]
[1:17:15] I was thinking night this morning about
[1:17:18] a summation had unfolded itself how did
[1:17:28] I could stand in 1969 and declare the
[1:17:31] bride of Jesus Christ would lead the Son
[1:17:34] of Man the Word made flesh see it today
[1:17:49] [Music]
[1:17:52] looking at what he's doing he's
[1:17:55] revealing his word to you later
