[6:06] know I also got a I also got a pop up a
[6:14] prayer request on my phone I mean a few
[6:16] minutes ago for her brother in Australia
[6:17] that I used to and he said that the
[6:22] wildfires are just about on his family's
[6:25] property so let's just give the Lord in
[6:30] prayer before we get in the scripture
[6:31] well God we're so grateful to be able to
[6:33] gather around you were denied and look
[6:35] into the scripture and see more of you
[6:37] Lord and I pray God that you'll
[6:38] strengthen your people tonight or Jesus
[6:41] help me Lord that I might get out of the
[6:43] way Lord Jesus that you could say
[6:44] something worthwhile Lord God that Lord
[6:47] wouldn't the people leave the night Lord
[6:48] Jesus he'll go back to their home
[6:50] strength and then with something that
[6:52] they might overcome the temptations of
[6:55] this life and that the things of this
[6:56] world or God and I pray Lord God at
[6:59] night Lord if you'll remember brother
[7:01] Simon down there across it on the other
[7:03] side of the world Lord and his family
[7:05] and turn the turn the blow that fire
[7:07] away from his house Lord Jesus we know
[7:10] that you're still a prayer answering God
[7:11] and you're still able to come upon this
[7:13] evil God and we know Lord God that we
[7:16] have a special access as your bride to
[7:18] you Lord Jesus
[7:19] because we have a revelation sure of who
[7:21] you are and who we are in this hour that
[7:23] we're living in you know we just call
[7:26] upon the name of the Lord of our brother
[7:27] Lord Jesus and for all of the states
[7:29] that are missing absent tonight that are
[7:31] sick and afflicted and all the different
[7:33] things that up to befall in your people
[7:35] or God we ask Lord that you remember
[7:37] them Lord Jesus Lord God we just open up
[7:41] our hearts and our minds the night Lord
[7:43] Jesus and we pray that you'll feel
[7:44] welcome to come and walk the aisles with
[7:46] us tonight Lord Jesus Lord that you'll
[7:49] just quicken the word as we hear it or
[7:50] God and open
[7:52] open our hearts Lord Jesus we ask in the
[7:55] name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen let's
[8:00] go to Exodus chapter 12 every time I get
[8:03] up here I have to magnify the words a
[8:05] little bit more we're getting older
[8:10] there you go I'm gonna take this off
[8:16] we're supposed to be we're supposed to
[8:19] have Liberty right and it says Exodus
[8:24] chapter 12 verses three to eleven
[8:26] speaking unto all the congregation of
[8:28] Israel saying in the tenth day of this
[8:30] month they shall take to them every man
[8:32] a lamb according to the house of their
[8:34] fathers a lamb for an house and if the
[8:36] household be too little for the lamb let
[8:38] him and his neighbor next under his
[8:40] house take it according to the number of
[8:42] the souls every man according to his
[8:44] eating shall make your count for the
[8:46] lamb right then we'll go over to Isaiah
[8:48] chapter 22 first 22 and and I was gonna
[8:52] read Jeremiah so y'all can pop that down
[8:54] to the next screen but we'll stop at how
[8:57] Isaiah 22 and the key of the house of
[8:59] David will I lay upon his shoulder so he
[9:02] shall open and no knee shall shut and he
[9:04] shall shut and none shall open you may
[9:07] be seated the Lord out his blessing to
[9:09] the reading of the word maybe a little
[9:11] odd combination of their scriptures
[9:12] tonight but what I wanted to talk about
[9:14] is the key to overcome the key to
[9:18] overcoming and you know if you can get
[9:20] access to the key if you can understand
[9:22] what the key is to overcoming in this
[9:24] life then then it'll give you strength
[9:27] in this out will give you something that
[9:29] you can use to combat the devil in this
[9:31] day that we're living in and that
[9:34] scripture in Exodus is kind of a strange
[9:36] I think made a strange little thing to
[9:39] kind of start with the night because
[9:41] really it's speaking of a people that
[9:44] were in natural bondage that they could
[9:46] look around and there were obviously an
[9:48] enslavement they they were forced to
[9:52] make bricks every day and forced to do
[9:54] manual labor and forced to work with
[9:56] without straw and all the different
[9:58] requirements that we know of from from
[10:00] from from reading and from my parents
[10:02] telling us all these stories and but you
[10:04] know tonight
[10:04] many of us many many people may be
[10:06] sitting here tonight are in spiritual
[10:08] enslavement where the devil has got you
[10:11] so bad on its so called up in the things
[10:13] of this world and so bogged down in life
[10:16] that you're you're actually in in
[10:18] bondage and and you know on the way over
[10:21] to church tonight brother Zack was was
[10:23] he said let's listen to Romans chapter
[10:24] six we began to listen to that and it
[10:27] began to speak about how that that you
[10:29] we were we were once slaves but now
[10:32] through Christ he has given us liberty
[10:34] to come out of that enslavement he's
[10:36] through through being identified at his
[10:39] death we have come into life and so you
[10:42] see if we could find that key if we
[10:45] could find a way to escape out of
[10:48] bondage it'll it'll give us power over
[10:50] all these things that that beset us so
[10:54] tonight you might you might say well I'm
[10:56] miserable I'm unsatisfied I know I'm
[10:59] thirsting for something and you might be
[11:01] bound by sin but there is a key of
[11:04] deliverance there is something that can
[11:06] set you free that can open up the prison
[11:08] bars that can open up the the open up
[11:11] that the gates of that prison house that
[11:13] you're in and I read maybe some
[11:16] scriptures like Isaiah chapter 22 and
[11:18] the key of the house of David which you
[11:20] know you could almost suspect maybe that
[11:23] tonight we might get so deep that you're
[11:25] you'd get a migraine and I don't intend
[11:27] to get really deep tonight I just want
[11:29] to preach maybe just kind of get back to
[11:31] the basics tonight the basics of
[11:32] salvation what it is to be a Christian
[11:34] what it is to have deliverance what it
[11:37] is to why we even want to be a Christian
[11:39] tonight why would we want to be why
[11:42] would we want to serve the Lord and I
[11:43] believe I believe that we should we
[11:45] should be able to come to a place where
[11:46] we want to serve the Lord so much to you
[11:49] you fall in love with the Lord so much
[11:51] that we're not serving God because we to
[11:54] get a place in heaven or hell or to get
[11:56] some reward like that but we're serving
[11:58] I'm serving Jesus tonight because I'm in
[12:00] love with Jesus we certainly serve Him
[12:03] not because we're forced to do it
[12:05] because there's a book of rules or
[12:06] something but because we're loved
[12:08] with God and I believe that tonight if
[12:10] you could fall in love with God so much
[12:12] that you're willing to do whatever it
[12:13] takes you're willing to obey His
[12:16] commandments you're willing to get on
[12:17] your knees and pray all night you're
[12:19] willing to study and get in the word I
[12:21] believe that that's the kind of
[12:23] relationship that God desires for his
[12:25] people is to not do things out of hate
[12:28] and do things out of a requirement but
[12:30] do things because you love the Lord
[12:32] Jesus you see there's a there's a
[12:36] problem the problem the reason why many
[12:39] of us are in bondage and are held in
[12:41] change of captivity by the devil is
[12:44] because there's a problem and if we
[12:46] could identify the problem first of all
[12:48] then we can identify what the solution
[12:50] is
[12:50] and the problem is the problem is that
[12:53] every one of us down on the inside of
[12:55] you you have a soul and that soul is the
[12:57] thing that carries you one way or the
[12:59] other even though you may not be able to
[13:01] really really even identify it right now
[13:03] as you're sitting in this congregation
[13:04] you can look and you could touch her
[13:07] your skin and you can you can feel you
[13:09] could remember things and you can kind
[13:10] of be aware of your spirit as you reason
[13:13] and you remember but wait out on the
[13:15] inside of that man down at the very
[13:17] bottom is your soul is the thing that
[13:19] carries you that will carry you down or
[13:22] carry you up you're the problem that we
[13:25] have if we have a problem tonight is
[13:27] that you have a heart that needs to be
[13:29] changed the problem is your heart and
[13:32] you know the Bible says that man will do
[13:34] whatever is in their heart whatever is
[13:36] in your heart is the thing that will
[13:37] cause you to go this way or that way the
[13:40] thing that will cause you to desire evil
[13:42] or to call you to desire good that will
[13:45] cause you to love the Lord or cause you
[13:47] to love the world
[13:48] it's that thing way down on the inside
[13:51] and you need deliverance you need that
[13:54] the problem that we have is that that
[13:56] heart needs to be changed you see the
[14:00] Word of God is what discerns the heart
[14:02] and Jeremiah chapter 17 verse 9 it says
[14:05] the heart is deceitful above all things
[14:07] and desperately wicked who can know it
[14:09] the heart is so deceitful that you could
[14:12] be sitting here today thinking that
[14:14] because you pay your tithes or because
[14:16] you're in the Lula Assembly or
[14:18] brother Dale is your pastor because
[14:20] you're sitting here in a message church
[14:22] that you are right but the heart is
[14:24] deceitful you can be deceived by those
[14:26] things because your heart can still be
[14:29] not be filled with the presence of the
[14:31] Living God and you will be deceived and
[14:34] I wanted maybe tonight to share with you
[14:36] how you can not be deceived how to know
[14:39] whether you've got the real genuine
[14:41] baptism of the Holy Ghost or not because
[14:43] we'll see what when when you understand
[14:45] what the answer what the remedy is then
[14:47] you can understand your condition in
[14:50] this hour the Bible says in Jeremiah
[14:52] Jeremiah chapter 17 verse 10 I the LORD
[14:55] search the heart I try the reigns even
[14:59] to give every man according to his ways
[15:01] and according to the fruit of his doings
[15:03] in other words the Lord is constantly
[15:06] examining your motives the thing that
[15:08] drives you down on the inside to see
[15:11] what is causing you to act and do the
[15:13] way that you that you are and what is
[15:16] the way that God deserves the Bible says
[15:18] that the word is a discerner of the
[15:20] thoughts and intents of the heart
[15:22] do you realize that when you come and
[15:24] sit in the sanctuary of the Lord and the
[15:25] word goes from over the pulpit the word
[15:27] is actually discerning what is in your
[15:29] heart you'll sit there and you'll say
[15:31] well I don't believe that or I reject
[15:33] that or you'll maybe even feel a little
[15:35] bit nervous a little bit shaky I wonder
[15:37] if that Minister is preaching on me
[15:38] tonight I wonder if he's talking to me
[15:40] well maybe the minister doesn't even
[15:42] know what in the world your situation is
[15:44] but yet the word is going forth and it's
[15:46] discerning the thoughts and intents of
[15:48] your heart the word is what what God
[15:50] uses to measure you remember the
[15:52] measuring line that zerubabbel used to
[15:54] build the temple he took them at the
[15:56] plumb line and he measured the temple he
[15:58] measured this construction work against
[16:00] the word he compared it with the word
[16:02] and that's what we're doing tonight
[16:03] we're comparing our lives we're looking
[16:05] into the edge of the scripture and as a
[16:07] mirror that the Bible says to see how
[16:09] our lives are measure up because how
[16:14] will you know how the only way that you
[16:17] can know what is down on the inside of
[16:19] your soul is to compare it with the word
[16:22] the the heart is deceitful
[16:24] the heart will deceive
[16:25] and make you think that everything's
[16:27] alright because you you got maybe all
[16:30] the examples that we've used before
[16:31] paving the parking lot and putting a
[16:33] roof on the church and all the good
[16:35] things playing in being a musician and
[16:37] in the church band and all of those
[16:39] things all of those things are are
[16:40] wonderful and needful but they are there
[16:43] will come to naught at the end of the
[16:44] road if you don't have the life of
[16:47] Christ on the inside to bear record for
[16:49] you to testify you to to make an
[16:51] atonement for you to purge you of all
[16:52] your sins the 2nd Corinthians chapter 3
[16:59] verse 15 and 16 it says but even under
[17:02] this day when Moses is rare the veil is
[17:05] upon their heart nevertheless when it
[17:06] when it the heart when it shall turn to
[17:08] the Lord the veil shall be taken away if
[17:10] your heart will turn to the Lord then
[17:12] the veil over your eyes will be taken
[17:15] away and you'll be able to see Jesus for
[17:17] who he really is you know we think we
[17:23] think if we can if we can just be good
[17:25] if we can just get if we can just get
[17:27] people to wear a longer dress or if we
[17:29] the women to wear a longer dress if we
[17:32] can just get them to look different that
[17:33] will change things if we can just get
[17:35] somebody maybe if we can just shut down
[17:37] all the cigarette factories if we can
[17:39] shut down all the alcohol factories if
[17:41] we can pass all these laws so that you
[17:43] can't sell marijuana or LSD or all these
[17:45] different things in the street then that
[17:47] will change things but the problem
[17:49] tonight is not the laws of the land and
[17:51] all these different kind of things the
[17:53] problem is your heart that is the
[17:54] problem the Bible says now the Lord is
[18:00] that spirit and whether Spirit of the
[18:01] Lord is there is Liberty but we all with
[18:04] open face beholding as in a glass the
[18:06] glory of the Lord are changed into the
[18:08] same image from glory to glory even as
[18:11] by the Spirit of the Lord and David said
[18:14] in Psalm 139 verse 23 to 24 he said
[18:17] cirques me O God and know my heart fry
[18:20] me and know my thoughts and see if there
[18:23] be any wicked way in me and lead me in
[18:25] the way everlasting
[18:26] I wonder tonight if there's any
[18:28] Christians here that are really desiring
[18:30] for God to search them and try them and
[18:32] see if there's anything any incorrect
[18:34] motive in their life and to probe deep
[18:36] and find out
[18:37] you know image to the point where you're
[18:40] not afraid for your your dirty laundry
[18:43] to be aired for everything there just to
[18:45] be made open for you to cuz I believe I
[18:47] believe when God gets ahold of a
[18:49] person's life and changes them and
[18:51] changes their whole direction then now
[18:53] you've got a testimony you've got you've
[18:55] got something that you can share with
[18:56] people and say I once was like this and
[18:59] now I'm like this and maybe that's one
[19:02] thing I want to declare up to all the
[19:03] young people tonight is that pretty much
[19:05] all the older ones in this building all
[19:07] right we could go around and point out
[19:09] different examples of people we we once
[19:11] were lost in seeing every person in here
[19:14] has a story every person has a testimony
[19:16] where we're not just a bunch of goody
[19:18] two-shoes I don't believe that God wants
[19:20] a bunch of good Christians he doesn't
[19:23] want good people he wants people that
[19:25] have been changed by the Holy Ghost by
[19:27] the power of God in their life and if
[19:30] God can change my life if he could
[19:32] change by the way his life if he can
[19:33] change by the Tonys life if he can
[19:35] change by the John's life he can change
[19:37] your life too we've got all these
[19:39] testimonies of people whose lives have
[19:41] been changed tonight and he can do the
[19:42] same thing for you we don't need to be
[19:46] good we need to be Christian you know
[19:51] you remember the stories about all the
[19:54] all the people in the Old Testament who
[19:55] gave God just a little bit of their life
[19:58] Samson he gave God his his faith in his
[20:01] gift but he wouldn't give God his heart
[20:03] he gave his heart to Delilah but he
[20:06] wouldn't give God his whole heart and
[20:08] and about Saul who who failed to just
[20:11] completely destroy the Amalekites
[20:12] because he failed to give God his whole
[20:15] heart then you've got people like David
[20:18] who gave their gave their whole heart to
[20:20] God but yet yet they would slip up every
[20:23] now and then they would slip up in big
[20:25] major ways you see the problem tonight
[20:28] is our heart if you've got a real
[20:31] genuine converted heart and you slip up
[20:34] and fall you're gonna go run right back
[20:35] to Jesus and say Lord forgive me I
[20:37] messed up save me repair
[20:40] of what I've done and and the Bible says
[20:43] that he's just and able to forgive you
[20:45] of your sins if you'll just ask him
[20:47] ELISA the problem the problem tonight is
[20:50] our heart it's the one that's sitting in
[20:52] your seat warming your seat tonight it's
[20:55] not the one sitting next to you it's not
[20:57] the one behind the pulpit it's not your
[20:59] pastor tonight it's not the song leader
[21:01] the problem is not your friends and it's
[21:04] not your parents many times we think the
[21:06] problem is our parents if our parents
[21:08] would raise us a little bit different
[21:10] and all this kind of thing but you
[21:11] remember the Bible tells us of a little
[21:13] boy named Josiah who was raised by
[21:15] ungodly parents but when he came of age
[21:17] they put a crown on his head and he said
[21:19] I'm going to serve the Lord that I've
[21:21] heard about listen we can there's many
[21:24] things that we can blame the night but
[21:26] the problem the problem is our own heart
[21:28] we are the harder problem if we could
[21:31] change the way if we could change our
[21:34] hearts tonight then we could change the
[21:36] church the whole church would change if
[21:39] we could get a heart change but we just
[21:43] many times we just settle for being good
[21:46] I don't want to settle for being good
[21:49] tonight the Bible says in Ephesians
[21:52] chapter 6 verse 2 to 4 it says honor thy
[21:55] father and mother which is the first
[21:57] commandment with promise that it may be
[21:59] well with thee and thou may'st live long
[22:01] on the earth and you father's provoke
[22:03] not your children to wrath but bring
[22:05] them up in the nurture and admonition of
[22:07] the Lord and I believe that the nurture
[22:10] and admonition of the Lord is not to
[22:11] train our children just to be goody
[22:13] two-shoes I don't want my children to be
[22:15] goody two-shoes where they're just going
[22:17] around faking a good Christian life then
[22:19] when they come to church they put on a
[22:21] big show and then when they go off with
[22:22] some buddies somebody can't see then
[22:24] they are totally different I want my
[22:26] children to be saved and saved and and I
[22:30] believe tonight that the nurture and
[22:31] admonition of the Lord
[22:32] is not just telling them to put on a
[22:35] show but actually loving them and being
[22:37] salty in front of them and letting them
[22:39] know that when they're when they go to
[22:41] bed at night that you're praying for
[22:43] them they can hear your prayers through
[22:45] the house that you have a Bible study
[22:46] with them you're bringing them up in the
[22:48] nurture and admonition of the Lord
[22:50] but
[22:50] cause you're bringing them up in a way
[22:51] the way that they should go and that way
[22:53] is to love the Lord God with all their
[22:55] heart and with all their soul and not
[22:57] just to be good people I believe we've
[23:00] got enough good people to fill it filled
[23:02] with many churches around the world
[23:04] today we don't need any more good people
[23:06] we need change people Matthew chapter
[23:12] let's go to Matthew chapter 19 and we'll
[23:13] find out what good people is Matthew
[23:16] chapter 19 verse 16 it says and behold
[23:18] one came and said unto him good master
[23:20] what good thing shall I do that I may
[23:23] have eternal life and first of all he
[23:25] was coming to him thinking with all this
[23:27] goody-two-shoes non-seeing it's good and
[23:29] master good master what good thing shall
[23:32] I do what thing can I do that that would
[23:35] be really good that would warrant me
[23:37] eternal life and he said unto Him why
[23:39] call us down me good in other words you
[23:41] don't know what you're talking about you
[23:43] don't know whether I'm good or not
[23:44] you're just trying to try to talk up to
[23:47] me trying to try to get on my good side
[23:49] there is none good but one that is God
[23:52] and if there's none good but one then
[23:55] that's the one that you need inside to
[23:57] change you there's none good but one
[24:00] that is God but if thou will enter into
[24:02] life keep the commandments and he said
[24:05] unto Him hey he's still he's still
[24:06] babbling well I want to be good I'm
[24:09] having a problem with the thing that
[24:12] that being just good is not the thing
[24:14] that will give me eternal life he sat on
[24:18] him which jesus said thou shalt do no
[24:20] murder thou shalt not commit adultery
[24:22] thou shalt not steal thou shalt not bear
[24:24] false witness honor thy father and thy
[24:27] mother and thou shalt love thy neighbour
[24:29] as thyself the young man said on him all
[24:32] these things have I kept from my youth
[24:34] up what like I yet what he lacked was to
[24:38] have a heart that was willing to make
[24:40] the sacrifice to do whatever it took
[24:42] Jesus did not care about his money he
[24:45] don't care about your ties tonight he
[24:46] don't care about it in that way but you
[24:48] paid ties as a scriptural obligation
[24:51] because it's a requirement from God that
[24:53] if you'll give your tithes into the
[24:54] storehouse you'll get a reward back but
[24:57] God doesn't need your money he didn't
[24:59] need
[24:59] this man's money what he needed from him
[25:01] was to soften up his heart and give his
[25:03] heart wholly to God so that he was
[25:06] willing to part with whatever God
[25:07] required of him jesus said unto them if
[25:10] thou will be perfect go and sell that
[25:12] thou hast and give it to the poor and
[25:14] thou shalt have treasure in heaven and
[25:16] come and follow me listen you may be a
[25:19] keeper of the law tonight but have you
[25:22] fully surrendered your whole heart to
[25:24] God have you fully given over everything
[25:26] to God at you have you got to a place
[25:29] where you're just willing to lay
[25:30] everything out where where you don't
[25:32] care what people think about you where
[25:34] you don't care if people will mock you
[25:36] because of the things that you used to
[25:38] do you don't care if people will mock
[25:40] you because of the change that God has
[25:41] wrought in your life come to a place
[25:44] where you're willing to get down in the
[25:45] mud and the muck and the mire say God do
[25:48] something with me and change my life so
[25:50] that you could use me so that you can
[25:52] produce something glorious in my life
[25:58] the Bible says Hebrews in Hebrews
[26:00] chapter three verses 8 to 13 harden not
[26:03] your hearts as in the provocation and
[26:05] the day of temptation and the wilderness
[26:07] when your father's tempted me proved and
[26:10] saw my works 40 years wherefore I was
[26:12] grieved with that generation and said
[26:15] they do always err where in their heart
[26:18] and they have not known my ways because
[26:21] they were not willing to give their
[26:23] heart fully to God so I swear in my
[26:26] wrath they shall not enter into my rest
[26:28] take heed brethren lest there be any of
[26:31] you an evil heart of unbelief and
[26:33] departing from the Living God but exhort
[26:36] one another daily while it is called
[26:38] today lest any of you be hardened
[26:41] through the deceitfulness and so I
[26:43] exhort you tonight tonight I exhort you
[26:47] to not be hard-hearted to be zealous
[26:50] toward the Lord your God why because in
[26:55] Psalms chapter 51 David said for thou
[26:58] desirest God he knew that God did not
[27:00] desire sacrifice what God was really
[27:03] after was the sacrifices of God are a
[27:05] broken spirit a broken and a contrite
[27:08] heart O God that will not despise could
[27:11] you could you imagine if you
[27:12] we'll just conceptualize for a moment
[27:14] meditate on this on this thought that
[27:16] what God the sacrifice is that God is
[27:18] really after as a heart that's so Torah
[27:21] they're so broken and beat down and
[27:23] you're just so fed up with the world
[27:25] that you're ready to just lay everything
[27:27] aside and say God filled me with your
[27:29] Holy Ghost give it to me Lord listen
[27:32] tonight if there's a heart problem
[27:34] there's got to be a heart solution so
[27:37] now I want to shift over and talk about
[27:39] that because the heart solution is the
[27:42] key the key to overcoming the key to
[27:45] access into the throne room the key to
[27:48] access to every promise of God tonight
[27:50] and listen tonight I believe that I've
[27:53] got something to share with you tonight
[27:55] so don't enter into the slumber awake
[27:57] thou that sleepest Oh wake up rise up
[28:00] because I've got a message for you
[28:02] tonight I've got a message of cheer that
[28:03] will help you so don't be quickly -
[28:05] close your eyes tonight maybe if I yell
[28:10] it loud enough that you won't fall
[28:12] asleep how could you fall asleep well
[28:23] just as we get to the key of the
[28:25] overcomer the thing that will give you
[28:27] power to overcome the devil then you
[28:30] begin to enter into the Land of Nod
[28:31] [Laughter]
[28:35] listen we were reading in Exodus at the
[28:38] book of Exodus about how they they took
[28:41] the lamb inside inside of their house
[28:43] they brought the lamb and they began the
[28:46] requirement to a message from from the
[28:48] prophet of the day had gone out to take
[28:50] the lamb and kill it and put the blood
[28:52] over the little of your door then bring
[28:54] that lamb on the inside of your house on
[28:56] the inside of your house and tonight
[28:57] tonight the inside of your house is at
[29:00] this house this house is that is the
[29:02] house that you're supposed to bring the
[29:04] lamb into so if you want to know what
[29:07] the key is the key is a very mysterious
[29:09] thing the key is a thing Abel was the
[29:13] first person in the Bible that's
[29:15] recorded to have a revelation of what
[29:16] this key was and if you go all the way
[29:19] back you listen let's go all the way
[29:20] back and look at the key that Abel found
[29:23] the key to
[29:24] this into the throne room of God because
[29:27] you see when Adam and Eve were ejected
[29:29] from from the from the Garden of Eden
[29:31] they were put out that the cherubim
[29:33] stood there in the end the garden to
[29:35] guard the way back to the Tree of Life
[29:37] and they stood there and I imagine Abel
[29:39] would be looking there thinking how how
[29:42] can I get back into fellowship with God
[29:44] how can my fellowship how could my
[29:48] access to him be restored and he would
[29:50] sit there on the hill maybe maybe let's
[29:53] let's put it personal tonight maybe many
[29:55] of you tonight are thinking I know that
[29:57] there is a God I know that he's real
[30:00] I've been to camp meetings I've been to
[30:02] services well I felt his presence I know
[30:04] that he's real but yet I wonder I
[30:07] questioned if I really have access to
[30:09] him and maybe Abel was sitting on that
[30:11] hill thinking I wonder how I can have
[30:13] access to him and then all of a sudden
[30:15] God began to spoke speak to him and
[30:18] quicken the word that he had already
[30:19] heard from his dad he shared with him
[30:21] the things that he had heard his daddy
[30:23] explained to him but it quickening him
[30:26] and he realized all of a sudden maybe he
[30:29] heard a lamb bleating because you see
[30:32] the key to access back into the throne
[30:34] room of God in the fellowship with him
[30:37] tonight the key is that you must have a
[30:39] lamb Abel needed a lamb and he knew that
[30:42] the process for getting back into
[30:44] fellowship with God is that lamb had to
[30:46] die and he took a knife or a rock or
[30:49] whatever it was all bloody and and I
[30:51] didn't you see he came Kings eyes were
[30:55] veiled to what that key was Cain could
[30:58] not see what that key was that that the
[31:00] lamb was the access the lamb was the way
[31:03] back and I wonder when they were down in
[31:05] Egypt land if there were many Egyptians
[31:08] and all of the people all around the
[31:10] surrounding all the people that were
[31:11] painting that blood over the lintels of
[31:13] their door if they began to laugh and
[31:15] scoff and say like Cain dear that's not
[31:18] the key that's not the right way to do
[31:21] it but it was the right way to do it and
[31:25] see they were they were killing a an
[31:29] actual lamb back then but it spoke of
[31:31] something that happened to thousands of
[31:34] years
[31:35] that God would give his life on the
[31:36] cross for you and I because you see we
[31:39] needed a lamb - without that lamb you
[31:42] would not you would not be able to have
[31:44] access back into the throne room the
[31:48] whole scripture speaks of this labrum
[31:50] needed a lamb when he was going up the
[31:52] mountain with Isaac and Genesis chapter
[31:54] 22 he said and Abraham said my son God
[31:56] will provide himself a lamb for a burnt
[32:00] offering you see how he spoke
[32:01] prophetically that he would provide
[32:03] himself a lamb the key the key to
[32:08] getting access to God the key the key to
[32:11] being able to approach to God is that
[32:13] lamb and if you go back into the Old
[32:15] Testament and and look how Paul
[32:17] explained that situation he started in
[32:19] Hebrews 11 he began to say unable by
[32:22] faith able by faith in that lamb and
[32:24] then he jumps he skips over and he
[32:27] begins to talk about Enoch because that
[32:29] little bit of faith that he had in that
[32:31] lamb unfolded and unfolded unfolded
[32:34] until Enoch was able to take a body
[32:36] change based upon what that lamb had
[32:40] done based upon what the lamb had done
[32:44] and we are gonna take a body change
[32:46] based upon what the lamb has done the
[32:49] lamb of God the Bible says in Hebrews 11
[32:55] by faith Abel offered unto God a more
[32:57] excellent sacrifice than Cain and and
[33:00] verse 5 by faith Enoch was translated
[33:02] that he should not see death and was not
[33:05] found because God had translated him
[33:07] before before his translation he had
[33:09] this testimony that he pleased God the
[33:14] Bible says in Isaiah chapter 53 all all
[33:17] we like sheep have gone astray we have
[33:20] turned every one to his own way and the
[33:23] Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us
[33:26] all what is this talking about it's
[33:28] talking about that lamb that will give
[33:30] us access back into the throne room he
[33:33] was oppressed and he was afflicted yet
[33:35] he opened not his mouth
[33:36] he has brought as a lamb to the
[33:38] slaughter and as a sheep before her
[33:40] Shearer's it is dumb so he openeth not
[33:43] his mouth and the Bible says in Hebrews
[33:47] 9:22 almost
[33:48] all things are by the law purged with
[33:51] blood and without shedding of blood is
[33:52] no remission when second Corinthians
[33:56] chapter 5 for he hath made him to be sin
[33:58] for us who knew no sin that we might be
[34:01] made the righteousness of God in him in
[34:05] Romans chapter 5 verses 1 therefore
[34:07] being justified by faith we have peace
[34:10] with God through our Lord Jesus Christ
[34:13] by whom also we have access by faith
[34:16] into this grace do you see the lamb is
[34:20] the thing by which you have access
[34:22] access back into the grace of God the
[34:25] lamb is what gives you it is the key to
[34:28] opening up every promise of God but you
[34:30] see the thing is you've got to bring
[34:33] that lamb into your house you've got to
[34:35] do what they did down in Egypt land and
[34:37] eat that lamb and the Bible says they
[34:39] had heed everything even the pertinents
[34:42] thereof they had to eat the the hind
[34:44] part the head part and everything in
[34:46] between you've got to eat the whole
[34:48] revelation of Jesus Christ everything
[34:51] that's been revealed down through the
[34:53] triple seven church ages and now
[34:55] especially in this age we don't just get
[34:57] a part a we get the entire thing we have
[35:01] access to the whole thing that's been
[35:03] revealed to us and you see the
[35:05] revelation of that lamb is the key that
[35:08] will give you access to open up the door
[35:10] it will give you access you can catch
[35:13] that revelation you know what it'll make
[35:15] you do it'll make you come to church
[35:17] when the doors are open it'll make you
[35:19] open your Bible when you're home in a
[35:21] long time
[35:22] it'll make you begin to pray and ask God
[35:24] to reveal it to you
[35:25] it'll make you get serious with about
[35:27] God because you can see what the key is
[35:29] then you can have an understanding of
[35:31] what you have to do you see you know the
[35:38] whole journey the whole thing starts
[35:40] with your house in Joshua chapter 24 15
[35:44] us as an if it seem evil unto you to
[35:46] serve the Lord choose you this day whom
[35:48] you will serve whether the gods which
[35:50] your father's served that we're on the
[35:52] other side of the flood or the gods of
[35:54] the amorite sand whose land you dwell
[35:56] but as for me and my house we will serve
[35:59] the Lord
[36:00] I believe that every Christian here
[36:02] today is going to make that same
[36:04] determination that same statement as for
[36:07] me and my house we are going to allow
[36:09] the lamb to come in we're gonna allow
[36:11] the lamb to come in and have complete
[36:13] lordship over my home not one room not
[36:16] one door in my house will be off-limits
[36:18] I'm gonna let him come in and have
[36:20] complete sway over the whole thing he
[36:23] can look and examine it pull open the
[36:25] dresser drawers and pull open the
[36:26] cupboards and look wherever he wants to
[36:28] and examine and see if there's anything
[36:30] unclean allow him to do like David said
[36:33] and search my heart and try my reins and
[36:35] search my whole house and see if there's
[36:37] anything within me that said that's not
[36:40] right because when the lamb is in your
[36:43] house that will give you access back to
[36:45] God and how do you get the key how do
[36:48] you get the lamb in your house eat the
[36:51] lamb you must eat the book you must take
[36:53] it and you must eat it all you must eat
[36:55] it up because we're going out in the
[36:57] morning they they couldn't go on that
[37:06] journey without eating that lamb they
[37:09] could not go on that journey without
[37:10] that blood over the door of our house
[37:12] they could not go over to the Red Sea
[37:15] and expected the part they could not go
[37:17] expect to go into the Promised Land
[37:18] except they had accepted that lamb into
[37:21] their house and you see that's one thing
[37:25] I believe that many times we wore with
[37:27] this we want to jump the gun we want to
[37:30] find a quick way to kind of to get to
[37:34] the end of the journey you can't you
[37:36] don't build a house without laying the
[37:38] foundation first because you imagine a
[37:41] couple getting married and they don't
[37:42] even realize whether or not they love
[37:44] each other and they don't have all they
[37:46] don't have oh the man doesn't have a job
[37:47] and the woman doesn't hardly have I
[37:50] understand the basics of her domestic
[37:52] ability and all those kind of things she
[37:53] doesn't hardly have her foundation laid
[37:56] out you don't you've got to lay a
[37:58] foundation before you before you move on
[38:00] you've got to get the you know people
[38:03] people come to church sometimes in there
[38:04] and they're beginning to say well I tell
[38:06] me what the seven seals are tell me
[38:08] we'll tell me what the seven seals you
[38:09] how are you going to get the seven seals
[38:11] unless you
[38:12] that foundation lady you can't out there
[38:14] you can't you can't even begin to
[38:16] approach to understand the seven seals
[38:18] of the seven thunders until you've had
[38:20] the foundation laid first worry about
[38:22] getting the lamb in your house and then
[38:24] you can worry about the things that come
[38:26] after that and the Bible says they shall
[38:29] eat the flesh in that night roast with
[38:31] the fire and unleavened bread and all
[38:33] those things I'm just trying to we got
[38:37] this new clock and there's moving around
[38:39] just the same as that old clock they're
[38:41] just in a different way we can see he is
[38:44] the key the lamb is the key the lamb is
[38:47] the key to open up the shut door the
[38:50] lamb is the key the lamb was the key to
[38:52] allow the high priest to go into the
[38:53] interval and everybody would be looking
[38:56] at the high priest going in the interval
[38:57] and wondering how can I go in there -
[38:59] and then one day the real lamb showed up
[39:02] and gave His life so that you two could
[39:04] go beyond the veil because the lamb is
[39:06] the thing that gives sight to your soul
[39:09] the lamb is God's pardon to you it gives
[39:12] you access to the promises of God it
[39:15] gives you power to overcome the devil
[39:17] the lamb is the seal on your life and
[39:23] what is the lamb what what do I mean
[39:25] when I say the lamb I mean the river the
[39:27] lamb is Jesus Christ so the revelation
[39:30] of Jesus Christ is the key that opens up
[39:34] access to you to every promise of God I
[39:39] hope you can see now how to know whether
[39:42] you got it or not
[39:43] do you see Jesus let me just read some
[39:51] quotes here before I gonna go on into
[39:53] we're gonna get that down into whether
[39:55] metal rubber meets the road here in a
[39:57] second and the message Washington
[39:59] Jesus's feet brother Brahim said well I
[40:01] won't he was talking about how he
[40:03] thought the mayor had left him a key to
[40:04] the city and all those kind of things
[40:06] but he said I don't know whether this is
[40:08] the key to the city but I tell you what
[40:09] I want what I want is the key to the
[40:12] scripture the Holy Spirit and the key to
[40:15] the door brother Graham said what the
[40:18] church needs tonight is the key to the
[40:20] Scriptures the door
[40:22] isn't that strange how could you even
[40:24] pick
[40:24] that in your mind that the key to the
[40:27] door is the door the key to the door is
[40:30] the door which Christ is the door and he
[40:34] is the word faith in the word of the
[40:36] Living God unlocks every door God give
[40:39] us this key give us the key and in the
[40:44] Philadelphia interchange brother Ram
[40:45] said how can it be how could any man
[40:47] know he is the Christ until he's
[40:49] revealed himself to him see he reveals
[40:52] himself he has the key he can open it or
[40:55] leave it alone see I have the key to the
[40:58] door
[40:58] I am the doors what Jesus is saying I am
[41:01] the way I am the truth I am the light I
[41:06] am the Alpha and the I am the Omega I am
[41:09] the first and the last I am the father
[41:12] I am the Sun I am the Holy Ghost I am
[41:15] NOT I was and so on and so forth he's
[41:18] saying I am the key I am the one that
[41:22] can open up the door and if you have him
[41:25] on the inside he will reveal himself to
[41:27] you and he will open up the door to you
[41:35] should I read all these quotes or not
[41:43] let me read this let me read this this
[41:46] quote that questions God hiding himself
[41:48] in simplicity in 1963 because this is a
[41:51] good one that you hear ministers quote
[41:53] all over the place everywhere that if
[41:56] you if you can surrender fully in other
[41:58] words if you can get that lamb inside of
[42:01] you if you can open up the door if you
[42:04] can if you can yield yourself so that
[42:07] the lamb can come in he'll come in fully
[42:11] when you surrender fully he'll come in
[42:14] fully but until you surrender he can't
[42:17] come in fully surrender surrender your
[42:20] thoughts surrender your thinking
[42:22] surrender your life surrender your all
[42:24] surrender your prestige surrender
[42:26] everything to him now and he'll come in
[42:28] and fill you with the Holy Ghost that's
[42:30] what he's here to do
[42:32] he's already struck two or three here in
[42:34] the building so you see we've covered
[42:36] what we've talked about tonight is that
[42:38] the problem is not the other people in
[42:40] the building the problem is your heart
[42:41] that you need your heart to be changed
[42:44] and the thing that will change your
[42:45] heart is this key and if you can get
[42:47] this key the lamb is the key if you can
[42:50] get the key if you can surrender
[42:51] yourself and allow the lamb to come in
[42:53] then he will give you access into all
[42:56] the promises of God you will be able to
[42:58] understand the promises of God and how
[43:01] things work do you realize your eyes the
[43:03] way a key works you can give a key to a
[43:05] little child and say go unlock my car
[43:08] and bring me the thing that's laying in
[43:10] the seat and come back a little child
[43:13] can use the key but as time goes on the
[43:16] mystery of that key unfolds and then one
[43:20] day they're driving the car but you see
[43:23] you as a little child and the gospel can
[43:25] use a key you have the access to the key
[43:28] and the key will give you access to the
[43:30] promises of God but you don't have full
[43:32] access until you have fully surrendered
[43:36] yourself until you have given yourself
[43:38] completely over to God and how do you
[43:40] fully surrender yourself by eating the
[43:43] lamb by eating it and eating it and
[43:46] eating it and God reveals himself to you
[43:49] until you understand what you're doing
[43:51] here the day and now that you're living
[43:54] here what your purpose is you see
[43:56] yourself in the word you're identified
[43:58] in the scripture you know who Jesus
[44:00] Christ is and God is leading you and
[44:02] guiding you until you're coming down to
[44:05] a whole niche revelation of who he is
[44:07] and you can see all the world falling
[44:10] off all the different ones falling away
[44:12] but yet God is keeping you because you
[44:15] have the key you have the key and so the
[44:18] question and ideas will you open up the
[44:21] door and let the lamb come in will you
[44:25] open up the lamb and allow him and I
[44:27] have access to your house will you open
[44:30] it up tonight and allow that key to have
[44:32] preeminence and your dwelling place and
[44:35] so tonight I want to get a little bit
[44:37] down into where the rubber meets the
[44:39] road why do you resist why do you resist
[44:44] allowing God to come in and have
[44:46] preeminence in your life when you hear
[44:48] the gospel preached when you see signs
[44:51] and wonders to perform
[44:52] when you go to camps and see miracles
[44:55] performing in your sight when you go to
[44:58] services and see things done and you're
[45:00] very missed before your natural eyes and
[45:03] still you don't really resist to
[45:06] allowing the Lamb to come into your
[45:08] house why do you resist and I'll say
[45:10] this to the born-again believers -
[45:12] there's a reason why do you resist why
[45:16] do you come to a place where you're
[45:18] really willing to go around and around
[45:20] Mount Horeb
[45:21] and you're not willing to allow God to
[45:23] come in and have complete preeminence
[45:26] over your life why do you resist the
[45:29] Holy Ghost why do you resist it let's
[45:32] see I believe one reason you see when
[45:34] Moses began to preach to those children
[45:36] of Israel down in Egypt he was preaching
[45:38] a message that you've got to let the
[45:40] lamb come into your house you've got to
[45:43] allow it to come in and you've got to
[45:44] eat it all and they began to maybe some
[45:47] of them would would say well I don't
[45:49] understand why we got to do this that
[45:51] seems unnecessary that seems very ugly
[45:54] that seems very go to grow tests and so
[45:56] you see
[45:57] they did they they did not recognize
[45:59] that God was at the door of their home
[46:03] they did not recognize that he was in
[46:06] their midst
[46:07] and so maybe maybe tonight you've got
[46:09] that same problem maybe tonight that you
[46:12] don't realize that God is actually
[46:14] walking the aisles down to the pews God
[46:17] is actually the one right now knocking
[46:20] on the door of your heart but but maybe
[46:22] that you've allowed the devil a bit
[46:24] harden your heart to a place where your
[46:26] heart has come to a place where you
[46:27] don't recognize that that is who that is
[46:31] knocking at the door of your heart you
[46:36] see you can only repent you can only
[46:39] come to a place of repentance when you
[46:42] recognize the greatness of God when you
[46:45] recognize who that is at the door the
[46:48] reason people don't repent anymore is
[46:51] because they don't fear God anymore
[46:53] that's the reason why people don't
[46:55] reverence their parents that are good
[46:57] god-fearing Christians that's the reason
[47:00] people don't reference them to reverence
[47:01] the ministry anymore
[47:03] it's because the fear of God has left
[47:05] them they don't recognize who that is at
[47:08] the door listen I'm gonna take it back
[47:14] to the scripture here the Bible in
[47:15] Matthew chapter 10 says he that
[47:17] receiveth you receiveth me and he that
[47:21] receiveth me receiveth him that sent me
[47:26] now let's let's dive into that let's
[47:29] think about that a little bit he that
[47:31] receiveth you he's sending his disciples
[47:33] out he's sending his preachers out he
[47:35] sent in the god-fearing parents out to
[47:38] raise their children and the admonition
[47:40] of the Lord
[47:41] and when you as a parent lay the word
[47:44] out before your children and it's the
[47:46] same word the same gospel that the
[47:48] Prophet spoke it's the same gospel that
[47:51] came straight out of from God out of
[47:53] heaven and and if your children will
[47:58] receive that they're receiving God
[48:01] tonight if you will receive the gospel
[48:03] that I'm preaching to you it's the same
[48:05] thing as receiving the Lambs
[48:08] it's the same as receiving God Jesus
[48:14] said in Matthew chapter 18 verse 3 to 6
[48:16] and said verily I say unto you except ye
[48:19] be converted and become as little
[48:21] children you shall not enter into the
[48:23] kingdom of heaven become as little
[48:25] children who will just say teach me i my
[48:28] my bowl is empty fill it up give it to
[48:31] me and I'll do whatever you say if
[48:33] you'll do like that God can do something
[48:36] with you whosoever therefore therefore
[48:39] shall humble himself as this little
[48:41] child the same is greatest in the
[48:44] kingdom of heaven and whoso shall
[48:46] receive one such little child in my name
[48:50] receiveth me in other words if there's
[48:54] just a little child that all that know
[48:56] how to do in the gospel is take the key
[48:58] and open up the car door they can't even
[49:01] drive yet they're just a little child
[49:03] that can barely know how to operate the
[49:05] heavy machinery if you'll receive that
[49:08] little child that's got a revelation no
[49:10] matter how small it is of the gospel of
[49:12] Jesus Christ it's the same thing as
[49:14] receiving him but in Acts chapter 7
[49:18] verse 51 and they say he's stiff-necked
[49:21] and uncircumcised in heart and ears
[49:23] that's a Stevens sermon the sermon that
[49:25] Stephen preached that got him killed
[49:27] you do always resist the Holy Ghost as
[49:30] your father's did so do you why do you
[49:35] resist they resist it and why do you
[49:38] resist tonight do you know you know
[49:40] there's many people in the Bible that
[49:42] resisted there's many people here
[49:44] tonight that resisted and then one day
[49:46] God got ahold of them do you know that
[49:48] Paul resisted the Holy Ghost polls out
[49:50] there persecuting Christians and when
[49:52] God finally got a hold of him and he saw
[49:55] the pillar of fire Jesus's words to him
[49:57] or why do you kick against the pricks he
[50:00] was pricking at him and prod at him and
[50:02] trying to get him to move and he was
[50:03] resisting the whole law and you might
[50:06] tonight be resisting the Holy Ghost but
[50:09] I say to you tonight I open up the door
[50:11] of your heart
[50:12] the lamb come in what we need to do is
[50:19] recognize that he is here do you do you
[50:21] remember that little story that brother
[50:23] Bram told about the little boy the
[50:26] little boy that that he got sentenced to
[50:28] four for doing a big crime and and and
[50:31] his mama went to the governor and cried
[50:33] and everything and said let my let my
[50:35] boy out they're gonna kill him and and
[50:36] finally the governor said all right I'm
[50:38] going to talk to him and the governor
[50:40] walked in that walked into the the
[50:42] jailhouse and and the little boy was so
[50:45] so prideful and just so full of it's so
[50:48] arrogant I only want to talk to nobody I
[50:50] don't care who that is I don't I don't
[50:52] even want to I don't even want to see
[50:54] you and and as the governor was leaving
[50:56] somebody said you are so I'll say it my
[51:02] words you're so dumb
[51:03] how could you be so stupid how could you
[51:07] be so ignorant to let the governor that
[51:09] had the pardon in his hand walk out and
[51:12] leave you and the little boy with the
[51:13] remorse went to the gallows and gave his
[51:16] life knowing that the governor had come
[51:18] to give him his pardon because he didn't
[51:20] recognize who that was at the door
[51:23] you see how to tonight do you recognize
[51:26] the lamb is here at the door knocking at
[51:29] the door of your heart
[51:30] my brother Bernie said the last thing
[51:31] the boy said when they put the blast
[51:33] black mask over his face to hang him
[51:35] when they pull the rope up tight put the
[51:38] mask over him said think of it
[51:40] the governor stood in my cell and would
[51:43] have pardoned me if I hadn't turned him
[51:46] out and you know one of these days
[51:48] there's gonna be a time come when many
[51:50] people will look back on congregants
[51:52] services like this like this very night
[51:55] and think if I would have known that
[51:57] Jesus Christ was in the building
[51:59] if I would have known that that was him
[52:01] knocking at the door in my heart I
[52:03] wouldn't have turned him out and I
[52:05] wouldn't I believe that's the purpose of
[52:06] the phone phone ministry is to identify
[52:08] to you when the governor when the G when
[52:11] the Lord Jesus is knocking at the door
[52:13] of your heart to open up your eyes like
[52:15] a light you did with a lot Elijah prayed
[52:18] for God to open up his service eyes so
[52:20] that he could see all the chariots of
[52:22] fire around the hill open up your
[52:24] tonight and see who that is knocking at
[52:27] the door of your heart tonight why do we
[52:31] resist another reason is because we're
[52:34] satisfied with where we are we get to a
[52:37] place where we just come to church and
[52:39] we're going through the motions and
[52:40] we're just coming and we're sitting
[52:41] where we're happy with that position in
[52:44] church we're happy with playing an
[52:46] instrument or whatever we're happy being
[52:48] a deacon we're happy being a minister
[52:50] whatever it is because you know you can
[52:53] get satisfied even if you're born again
[52:55] God being born again does not take away
[52:58] your free will you can get to a place
[53:00] where you're just like well I'm happy
[53:03] I'm a Christian I'm just fine with a
[53:06] place where I am and you get so
[53:09] complacent with where you don't go
[53:11] studying to study the word anymore you
[53:13] don't keep opening up here opening up
[53:16] your Bible at night you forget praying I
[53:18] was talking to somebody at a church in
[53:20] another Church recently and they were
[53:21] saying it seems like people in the
[53:23] message don't even believe in praying
[53:25] anymore
[53:25] they don't they don't pray anymore they
[53:28] and I want to tell you tonight I believe
[53:31] that you feel opened up the lamb and let
[53:33] that lamb have access to you something
[53:36] within you will begin to cry out for
[53:38] your fellow believers for your church
[53:40] for the home for your children something
[53:43] will begin to cry out and you you'll
[53:45] understand what true prayer is why
[53:47] because you're not satisfied with where
[53:49] you are oh don't Lord don't let me blow
[53:55] my voice out I got some more to say
[54:00] you're not satisfied with where you are
[54:02] we get to pledge to a place where we
[54:04] just find with where you are do you know
[54:07] do you know the Bible says that is the
[54:08] problem with the Laodicean Church age
[54:10] and later in Revelation chapter 3 he
[54:13] said it says I know thy works that thou
[54:15] art neither cold nor hard I would that
[54:18] what colder heart so then because thou
[54:19] art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I
[54:21] will spew thee out of my mouth
[54:23] lukewarm means you're just going to
[54:26] church you're doing your helping you're
[54:29] putting some extra money into the church
[54:31] you're doing some things but yet you
[54:33] grow to a place where maybe maybe you
[54:35] think well III I don't know if
[54:37] can understand anymore it seems so
[54:39] complicated when they talk about seven
[54:41] seals and the seven thunders and Daniel
[54:43] seventy weeks and all these things you
[54:45] know what I'm just gonna I'm just going
[54:47] to put that off a little bit because I'm
[54:48] satisfied with where I am I'm satisfied
[54:51] do you realize that if you don't catch a
[54:54] revelation if God does not give you a
[54:56] revelation of the seven thunders if the
[54:59] seven thunders voices do not Thunder out
[55:01] in your life if God does not reveal that
[55:03] to you you will have to go by the way of
[55:06] the grave the seven Thunder Revelation
[55:08] is a revelation of the seven seals as a
[55:11] revelation that God is completing the
[55:14] work of redemption in you and you are
[55:15] going to take the body change but if you
[55:18] get complacent and say well I'm
[55:19] satisfied I don't need to understand all
[55:21] these things that seem so complicated I
[55:24] don't need to get into the mysteries why
[55:26] do I need to understand who is this milk
[55:27] is today why do I need to understand
[55:29] Christ the mystery of God revealed it's
[55:31] good enough for me to let me feel the
[55:34] Holy Ghost to be born again and I'm not
[55:35] gonna go on I'm not
[55:37] listen there's more to this than just
[55:39] being born again don't be satisfied when
[55:42] you come to faith something in you when
[55:44] you get born again should be crying out
[55:46] should be longing for more of God to
[55:48] never get satisfied never get satisfied
[55:51] while you're there there's always more
[55:55] of God and if you can fully or yield
[55:57] yourself God will fully fill you up
[55:59] never get bored tired weary or
[56:02] pessimistic listen we I think we get so
[56:07] satisfied with where we are that when we
[56:09] come to church many times we're already
[56:10] plotting our exit we're already thinking
[56:12] about how we can make a quick exit as
[56:14] soon as the doors come up what I'm gonna
[56:16] I'm gonna say I'm gonna get out of here
[56:18] as soon as the doors come up when I'm
[56:19] gonna I'm gonna try to get my car before
[56:20] the rush I'm gonna I'm out of here we're
[56:25] thinking we're plotting because our
[56:27] minds are not on the service we're not
[56:29] we're not concerned about the Word of
[56:31] God we're not concerned about the Word
[56:33] of God so much - we're ready to just say
[56:35] eat at all even the pertinence thereof
[56:39] we're so we're so concerned with how
[56:42] long the preacher goes and whether our
[56:44] behinds get tired or not and whether we
[56:46] get stiff in the chair
[56:48] sitting at listen to the preacher that I
[56:51] believe now more than ever we should be
[56:54] more concerned with the Word of God than
[56:56] ever because you can see the day and the
[56:58] hour that we're living in now is not the
[57:00] time to get complacent let me read some
[57:09] things that brother Graham said it
[57:11] serves we would see Jesus he said it's
[57:14] because there's something in them that
[57:15] desires to be satisfied they won't
[57:17] there's a little place in a man he's
[57:19] talking about why people go into seeing
[57:20] and all these things there's a little
[57:22] place in a man a man's heart a woman's
[57:25] heart and God made that place for
[57:27] himself how dare you try to take the
[57:29] things of the world and put it in there
[57:31] where God made for himself to sit there
[57:34] God is our joy God is our pleasure God
[57:38] is our satisfaction that's where it
[57:40] belongs in here let God in and let the
[57:43] other things and then the other things
[57:44] are so dead you don't even care about
[57:47] them no more and then down at the bottom
[57:50] he says let's climb at least keep
[57:52] climbing higher and higher until we
[57:55] reach that promised land
[57:56] you see there's there's another another
[57:57] quote I have in there I'll just I'll
[57:59] just touch on briefly about how brother
[58:01] Adam said that the reason that God
[58:02] likens his church his bride to an eagle
[58:04] it's because they Eagle does not set his
[58:07] nest down on the ground anywhere the
[58:09] eagle has high aspirations the eagle is
[58:12] always seeking to climb higher and
[58:14] higher in other words the Eagle is not
[58:16] satisfied by being down in the chicken
[58:18] yard the Eagle is got to go higher and
[58:22] you are an eagle and you've got to go
[58:24] higher you've got to always be climbing
[58:26] higher and higher and Deuteronomy this
[58:30] in Deuteronomy chapter 8 verse 10 to 15
[58:33] I don't know why I'm rushing let me let
[58:34] me slow down we got we got time I'll get
[58:37] off I get all nervous or something and
[58:40] start rushing and and y'all don't make
[58:43] me nervous now don't don't start don't
[58:45] start again droopy-eyed that'll make me
[58:48] want to rush my brother aaron said i
[58:50] like that that was pretty good
[58:53] Deuteronomy chapter 8 verse 10 wind out
[58:56] this is the warning that God gave them
[58:58] in there and as they were coming into
[58:59] the Promised Land when thou has two
[59:01] eaten and Artful then thou shalt bless
[59:04] the LORD thy God for the good land which
[59:07] he hath given thee see when you eat when
[59:11] you eat and your fool then you start
[59:13] getting satisfied that's a dangerous
[59:16] place to be that's why he says beware
[59:19] that they'll forget not the LORD thy God
[59:21] and not keeping his Commandments and his
[59:24] judgments and his statutes which I
[59:26] command thee this day lest when thou has
[59:29] two eaten and are full and I spilt
[59:31] goodly houses and dwelt therein and when
[59:34] I heard and that flocks multiply and
[59:36] that silver and that gold is multiplied
[59:38] and all that thou hast is multiplied
[59:40] then that heart be lifted up and now
[59:42] forget the LORD thy God which brought
[59:44] thee forth out of the land of Egypt from
[59:48] their house of bondage do you realize
[59:50] that's what meetings here sitting here
[59:51] tonight have done what we've done is
[59:54] we've we do you remember about when you
[59:56] first got the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[59:58] and you were going to the meetings and
[59:59] yeah it didn't care how far away it was
[1:00:02] you would drive and you were so on fire
[1:00:04] for the Lord and you were eating and you
[1:00:06] got full and then it's time went on you
[1:00:08] found you a good church and you just
[1:00:10] kind of you began to just relax a little
[1:00:12] bit well we got it made here we got some
[1:00:15] good musicians we got some good
[1:00:16] preaching and you get complacent and you
[1:00:19] get to a place where you don't you stop
[1:00:21] digging into the world there's there's
[1:00:24] always no matter how deep you go into
[1:00:27] the gospel there's more and more things
[1:00:29] to continue to unfold remember what I
[1:00:32] was explaining about Abel to Enoch Abel
[1:00:35] started off on the little key of the
[1:00:37] lamb but it unfolded unfolded until it
[1:00:40] got to Enoch and Enoch took a body
[1:00:42] change Abel didn't take a body changed
[1:00:45] but Enoch took a body changed and the
[1:00:47] revelation of Jesus Christ unfolds and
[1:00:49] unfolds in your life until you become so
[1:00:52] fool that you'll take a body change but
[1:00:54] don't get complacent don't come to a
[1:00:56] place where you're satisfied and you
[1:00:58] just stop the Bible says in Psalms
[1:01:01] chapter 63 I love reading that when I
[1:01:03] when I was a brand new Christian I would
[1:01:05] read a
[1:01:06] and it inspired me how gung-ho and
[1:01:08] fervent and zealous he was for the Lord
[1:01:11] about how he talked about his heart
[1:01:12] paining for the Lord like his heart was
[1:01:15] painting like a heart a deer that would
[1:01:18] run after the water brook that in other
[1:01:20] words he he never got satisfied he
[1:01:23] always wanted more he said my soul shall
[1:01:26] be satisfied as with Mara and fatness
[1:01:29] and my mouth shall praise they were
[1:01:31] joyful lips when I remember the upon my
[1:01:33] bed and meditate upon thee on the night
[1:01:35] watches do you do that do you remember
[1:01:38] him when you go to bed are you do you
[1:01:39] sit there and just meditate on him and
[1:01:41] till the Spirit comes and washes over
[1:01:43] you and the tears begin to fall down
[1:01:45] your just praise of God it praise God in
[1:01:47] the midnight hour have you or have you
[1:01:49] come to a place where you're just you're
[1:01:51] just so complacent that you've forgotten
[1:01:52] those things I want to encourage like
[1:01:55] brother Wayne's been doing to get back
[1:01:57] to a person who a revival where it's you
[1:01:59] and God and the personal fellowship and
[1:02:01] something's happening in your life it
[1:02:03] might be it might not be happening in
[1:02:05] the person sitting next to you in the
[1:02:06] church pew but let it happen in your
[1:02:08] life because the problem is with your
[1:02:10] individual heart because thou has been
[1:02:14] my help he says that therefore in the
[1:02:15] shadow of our Wings will I rejoice my
[1:02:17] soul followeth hard after thee thy right
[1:02:20] hand up hold of me Psalms chapter 63 he
[1:02:27] said a psalm of David when he was in the
[1:02:29] wilderness of Judah
[1:02:30] Oh God thou art my god early will I seek
[1:02:33] thee my soul thirsteth for the Mocs
[1:02:36] flesh longeth for thee and a dry and
[1:02:38] thirsty land where no water is to see
[1:02:41] thy power in that glory so as I have
[1:02:43] seen thee in the sanctuary because thy
[1:02:46] loving-kindness is better than life my
[1:02:49] lips shall praise thee do like David did
[1:02:52] and always be looking always be excuse
[1:02:56] me expecting expecting for something
[1:02:58] greater when you come to church I
[1:03:00] believe what we've what we've began to
[1:03:02] do is when we come to church we start
[1:03:04] expecting it to be the regular routine
[1:03:08] monotonous service but and the problem
[1:03:11] is not the service the problem is not
[1:03:13] the preacher the problem is not the song
[1:03:15] leader the problem is our expectations
[1:03:17] the problem was you
[1:03:19] the problem is that we've allowed
[1:03:20] ourselves to grow cold and weary but we
[1:03:23] were allowed ourselves to grow grow
[1:03:25] bored with what we're hearing but when
[1:03:28] you come into the sanctuary and you
[1:03:29] begin to expect God to speak to you to
[1:03:32] you then God will listen to you do you
[1:03:34] know Solomon we dedicated the temple he
[1:03:37] got the Ark of the Covenant in there he
[1:03:39] got everything all fixed but yet he was
[1:03:42] expecting something else to happen and
[1:03:44] then he began to call upon the name of
[1:03:46] the Lord he began to cry out to God and
[1:03:48] that's when the Shekinah glory came and
[1:03:50] filled the tabernacle and field that the
[1:03:53] lamb came and a bi abode there in the
[1:03:56] holy of holies and then one day Jesus
[1:03:59] the Lamb Himself came into the temple
[1:04:01] and the Pharisees and the Sadducees had
[1:04:03] gone to a place where they didn't expect
[1:04:06] anything anymore they were satisfied
[1:04:08] with a condition they were in they were
[1:04:10] fine and they because they were
[1:04:12] satisfied they didn't recognize when
[1:04:14] Jesus came to his temple and I'll read
[1:04:19] this before I keep going on it is not I
[1:04:21] be not afraid in 1960 brother I'm said
[1:04:26] you need him
[1:04:27] we all need him I need more of it you
[1:04:32] need more of it there's one thing that I
[1:04:34] can't get satisfied with there's one
[1:04:38] thing that I can't get satisfied with
[1:04:40] enough of God Oh as much as we can let
[1:04:43] ourselves go then God can come in but
[1:04:46] we've got to get ourselves out of the
[1:04:48] way our own ideas let the Holy Spirit
[1:04:51] come in and show us things to come he
[1:04:53] said he would do it and bring things to
[1:04:55] our remembrance cause you see we need a
[1:04:59] heart change tonight the problem is our
[1:05:01] heart the problem is our heart it's not
[1:05:05] my neighbor's heart it's our heart and
[1:05:08] you see there's a lot of different
[1:05:09] reasons why we resist because we don't
[1:05:12] recognize the presence of the Lord and
[1:05:14] here's another reason why we resist and
[1:05:16] I'm gonna be closing here in a minute I
[1:05:18] don't plan to keep you long tonight so
[1:05:20] don't don't worry about your weary back
[1:05:22] and those kind of things but listen the
[1:05:26] real reason this is
[1:05:27] where the rubber meets the road one of
[1:05:30] the reasons I believe tonight that we
[1:05:31] don't open up that door is because of
[1:05:33] our pride you know brother branham would
[1:05:36] say he was he would talk about how that
[1:05:38] that back then when he would be
[1:05:39] preaching he would talk about how that
[1:05:41] your flesh is hardly worth as if you
[1:05:43] could get all on the potash and all that
[1:05:44] stuff and put it in a little container
[1:05:46] whatever and measure it out weigh it out
[1:05:50] and see how much it was worth it would
[1:05:51] all come to 84 cents do you know what he
[1:05:54] was really talking about he's talking
[1:05:55] about your death when it comes down to
[1:05:58] the end of the road and your body is in
[1:06:00] the grave and your soul is going to go
[1:06:02] somewhere if your soul is not saved then
[1:06:05] all that's left is your body your body's
[1:06:08] down in the grave and all this living
[1:06:10] and looking in the mirror and taking
[1:06:12] selfies and and building up your hair
[1:06:15] and all this kind of stuff
[1:06:16] what will it amount to it won't amount
[1:06:18] to you it will amount to 84 cents you
[1:06:21] know I looked up what the what the price
[1:06:23] is with inflation recently and the price
[1:06:26] is still under $1 you're all of the
[1:06:29] components that go into your body is
[1:06:31] still worth less than $1 that's how much
[1:06:34] you are worth and we beauty it up we
[1:06:36] think what we do is we worry so much
[1:06:38] about what other people think that we're
[1:06:40] not willing to give ourselves over to
[1:06:42] Jesus Christ and you know what pride is
[1:06:45] I looked up the definition of it a pride
[1:06:47] is a feeling of deep play a feeling or
[1:06:50] deep pleasure or satisfaction derived
[1:06:52] from one's own achievements the
[1:06:55] achievements of those with whom one is
[1:06:57] closely associated or from qualities or
[1:07:00] possessions or possessions that are
[1:07:02] widely admired in other words when we
[1:07:04] begin to think that there's something
[1:07:06] about my makeup that makes me better
[1:07:08] than you and you know what happens in a
[1:07:11] young believers life for an old believer
[1:07:13] or any real believer really as you begin
[1:07:14] that pride begins to well up within you
[1:07:17] and you say I'm not gonna open up the
[1:07:19] door of my heart
[1:07:20] because I don't want to give somebody
[1:07:22] else credit for leading me to the Lord I
[1:07:24] don't want to give a gold my dad I don't
[1:07:26] want to get a gold star to that preacher
[1:07:27] I don't want to give us a gold star to
[1:07:30] this church your pride so Wells up
[1:07:32] within you and gee you think I'm the
[1:07:34] only one that can make a decision I'm
[1:07:36] the only one that can have an influence
[1:07:37] they can say and even when you
[1:07:40] to see other people begin to give their
[1:07:41] lives to the Lord you're so prideful
[1:07:43] that you begin to hate and despise
[1:07:46] listen that pride is a dangerous thing
[1:07:50] pride when you begin to it when your
[1:07:51] parents begin to talk to you about the
[1:07:53] Lord and begin to share the gospel with
[1:07:55] human pride begins to well up within you
[1:07:57] and say I'm not gonna open up the door
[1:08:00] but exact because if I give in it will
[1:08:03] give credit to my mom and daddy listen I
[1:08:06] believe tonight that there are some real
[1:08:08] god-fearing mamas and daddies in here
[1:08:10] and if anybody needs some credit it's a
[1:08:12] grill god-fearing mama and daddy that
[1:08:14] won't walk the walk that will walk that
[1:08:16] straight in there before you that will
[1:08:17] live a godly life it will pray before
[1:08:19] you pray pray over their house and try
[1:08:22] to try to live a clean sanctified life
[1:08:26] but what it what it's time to do is time
[1:08:29] to time to lay that pridefulness down
[1:08:32] and open up the door so that God can go
[1:08:35] meaning and second Timothy chapter 3
[1:08:37] said this now know also that in the last
[1:08:39] days perilous times shall come for men
[1:08:42] shall be lovers of their own selves
[1:08:44] covetous boasters proud blasphemers
[1:08:47] disobedient to parents see how he loves
[1:08:51] all that in disobedience to parent I
[1:08:53] don't care what gospel my parents bring
[1:08:55] I don't care I'm the one that that I
[1:08:57] think should be I think that I should be
[1:09:00] the one to have a cellphone I think that
[1:09:02] I should be the one to rule the roost I
[1:09:03] think that I should be the one to have
[1:09:05] control and that pride begins to take
[1:09:07] over and you begin to think that you're
[1:09:08] somebody listen you're not somebody
[1:09:11] you're you're not worth more than a
[1:09:15] dollar more than a book if we could
[1:09:18] really get in our in our heads that we
[1:09:20] are nothing without Jesus without that
[1:09:23] lamp if that Keys if that lamb doesn't
[1:09:25] enter into our house we are nothing and
[1:09:28] one day we'll be nothing but dirt in the
[1:09:30] ground without natural affection Keith
[1:09:35] imagine all the trucebreakers false
[1:09:37] accusers incontinent fierce despisers of
[1:09:42] those that are good could you imagine
[1:09:44] coming into the house of the Lord and
[1:09:45] looking around and other people that are
[1:09:47] trying to live a godly life and say I
[1:09:48] don't want to be like that because of
[1:09:51] the pridefulness of your heart the hey
[1:09:53] the enmity of your heart that that is
[1:09:55] nothing but that is nothing but the
[1:09:56] devil that has veiled your eyes and
[1:09:58] pulled the wool over your eyes to cause
[1:10:00] you to think that you're greater than
[1:10:02] the God of heaven traitors heady
[1:10:04] highminded lovers of pleasure more than
[1:10:07] lovers of god having a form of godliness
[1:10:09] but denying the power thereof i'm search
[1:10:11] trying to wait do you know what brother
[1:10:13] branham said the power of God is this is
[1:10:16] a thing that stumbles a lot of people
[1:10:18] the power of God is the word of God the
[1:10:22] power of God is when you allow the lamb
[1:10:24] to come into your home and you might
[1:10:27] feel something and you might not but God
[1:10:30] will reveal to you his word and that
[1:10:33] will give you power to overcome the
[1:10:35] devil and that's why I titled this
[1:10:36] sermon the key to overcome because they
[1:10:39] the key the lamb entering into your home
[1:10:42] will give you overcoming power to
[1:10:44] overcome everything that the devil
[1:10:46] throws your way
[1:10:47] proverbs chapter 16 says pride goeth
[1:10:50] before destruction and in hearty spirit
[1:10:53] before a fall
[1:10:55] better is it is to be of an humble
[1:10:57] spirit with the lowly then to divide the
[1:11:01] spoil with the proud I'd rather I'd
[1:11:08] rather have a humble spirit with a lot
[1:11:10] of people that did a mountain of mush in
[1:11:11] other words is what he's saying then to
[1:11:14] have great riches and how to divide it
[1:11:16] up how to figure out a way to divide it
[1:11:18] up with a bunch of prideful people a
[1:11:20] bunch of people that think that they're
[1:11:22] better than everybody else and listen
[1:11:24] that believing the message doesn't make
[1:11:26] you better than the other Church down
[1:11:27] the road or anything like that but when
[1:11:30] you get a real true revelation of God
[1:11:32] it'll make you it'll bring you down
[1:11:33] until you realize that that God has
[1:11:37] elevated you from a from a place of of
[1:11:40] turmoil and despair and all those kind
[1:11:44] of things let's let's read James chapter
[1:11:46] 4 he adulterers and adulteresses you not
[1:11:50] know you not that the friendship of the
[1:11:52] world is enmity with God whosoever
[1:11:55] therefore will be a friend of the world
[1:11:57] as the enemy of God do you think that
[1:12:00] the scripture saith in vain the spirit
[1:12:03] that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy
[1:12:06] the spirit in us is always seeking a way
[1:12:10] to make ourselves happy the spirit in us
[1:12:13] that dwelleth in us lusteth am be the
[1:12:16] spirit of us is always trying to do
[1:12:18] something but God gives us grace
[1:12:19] wherefore he saith God resists the proud
[1:12:22] but giveth grace unto the humble submit
[1:12:27] yourselves therefore to God resist the
[1:12:29] devil and he will flee from you know
[1:12:33] that's a scripture that we quote often
[1:12:35] resist the devil and he will flee from
[1:12:37] you but it says right before there that
[1:12:38] submit yourselves therefore to God
[1:12:40] submit yourself to God and then after
[1:12:45] you've allowed God to have control of
[1:12:46] your life to come in that you've opened
[1:12:49] up the door to him then you can resist
[1:12:52] the devil and he will flee from you draw
[1:12:54] nigh to God and He will draw nigh to you
[1:12:56] cleanse your hands you sinners and
[1:12:58] purify your hearts you double-minded be
[1:13:01] afflicted and mourn and weep let your
[1:13:03] laughter be turned to mourning and your
[1:13:05] joy to heaviness you know you think
[1:13:09] about all of all the people in the Bible
[1:13:10] that were there were examples of a pride
[1:13:14] and the end that they came to and people
[1:13:17] that were examples of somebody that
[1:13:18] we're willing to lay aside their pride
[1:13:20] that like that little woman that came to
[1:13:22] Jesus feet and went by all the mockers
[1:13:25] and the scoffers and and she she
[1:13:28] everybody knew Simon was there toning
[1:13:30] her and saying I I know what she is if
[1:13:32] Jesus knew who she really was he
[1:13:34] wouldn't let her do that because I know
[1:13:36] that this woman is a sinner he said this
[1:13:39] man if he were a prophet would have
[1:13:40] known who who and what manner of woman
[1:13:43] this is that touches him for she is a
[1:13:46] sinner but you know what she abandoned
[1:13:49] her pride and laid her pride to the side
[1:13:51] that got her sins forgiven because jesus
[1:13:54] said your sins though their many are
[1:13:56] forgiven the woman at the well didn't
[1:13:58] care when she heard Jesus when he
[1:14:00] exposed all of her faults she didn't
[1:14:02] care whether or not her past was exposed
[1:14:05] but she ran into the city and told
[1:14:07] everybody come see a man that has told
[1:14:10] me everything that I've done
[1:14:11] she didn't care if the whole world knew
[1:14:14] what she had done and listen when God
[1:14:15] gives you a testimony you don't
[1:14:17] the whole world knows what you've done
[1:14:19] and yeah the Pharisee and the tax
[1:14:25] collector he said the Pharisee looking
[1:14:26] down I think they that I'm not like
[1:14:28] other men even as this publican and the
[1:14:30] tax collector they are abandoning his
[1:14:32] pride and beating his chest and he got
[1:14:35] his sins forgiven because he laid his
[1:14:37] pride to the side pride is a thing that
[1:14:40] will prevent you from opening up the
[1:14:42] door why do you not open the door
[1:14:43] because you're so prideful we get so
[1:14:46] prideful that we come into the house of
[1:14:48] God and we're we're afraid to raise up
[1:14:50] our hands because of what other people
[1:14:51] will think about us we're afraid to say
[1:14:53] Amen because of what do you realize how
[1:14:55] silly that is I'm not going to say Amen
[1:14:58] because somebody will think well think
[1:15:01] what well think that I'm getting
[1:15:03] something from the Lord what a silly
[1:15:07] notion that the devil has has put in our
[1:15:10] ears that we can't say Amen because
[1:15:12] somebody will think well think we're
[1:15:14] having a personal revival somebody will
[1:15:17] think that we're a real Christian
[1:15:19] somebody I can't raise my hand and
[1:15:22] rejoice maybe if we get rid of pride
[1:15:24] enough that something will really happen
[1:15:26] maybe if we stop caring so much about
[1:15:29] what people think then people will look
[1:15:31] at us and say I want to be like that
[1:15:33] person you know really the devil has got
[1:15:37] us all snooker so much that hey he's
[1:15:40] trying to eat he's give puddings pride
[1:15:42] on us so much that to prevent us from
[1:15:45] being an example of what a real
[1:15:47] Christian should be my if we had turn
[1:15:52] loose one time and if we turn loose like
[1:15:55] we do when we get in our cars or in the
[1:15:57] shower or when we're along walking down
[1:15:59] the trail on the hills when we're
[1:16:01] studying the Bible we're just saying
[1:16:02] praise God
[1:16:03] if we turn loose and just let let God
[1:16:06] have his way I believe I believe some
[1:16:08] doors would open up
[1:16:09] I believe the lamb would come in and I
[1:16:11] believe the lamb would come into the
[1:16:13] sanctuary if we had a band and I pride
[1:16:15] if we just get to a place where you
[1:16:18] don't care anymore remember
[1:16:20] that was being testified about he was he
[1:16:23] was wounding the holy ghost and I forget
[1:16:26] all the names of the different people
[1:16:28] but the brother was the brother who took
[1:16:30] him down to to the to the to the MU the
[1:16:34] the the Pigpen and and he said get down
[1:16:37] in there and wall around and and he said
[1:16:40] well I'm not I'm not quite there yet but
[1:16:42] one day he was ready to get in that get
[1:16:44] in there and wall around with the pigs
[1:16:46] to get the Holy Ghost in the band said
[1:16:47] well you don't have to do that you just
[1:16:50] have to be willing to what do you have
[1:16:52] to be willing to do you have to be
[1:16:54] willing to abandon your pride you have
[1:16:56] to be willing to do whatever it takes
[1:16:59] you have to be willing to open up that
[1:17:01] door listen
[1:17:04] pride is pride is what keeps us from
[1:17:07] opening the door pride is what what what
[1:17:10] says well you know what I'm just gonna
[1:17:12] I'm just gonna put putting the gospel up
[1:17:15] in a little bottle and set it over here
[1:17:17] and one of these days one of these days
[1:17:20] I'm gonna get to it but right now I'm
[1:17:22] not ready I'm too prideful to open up
[1:17:24] the door and let let God come in I'm
[1:17:26] just gonna I'm just gonna stick it up
[1:17:28] there maybe on the shelf and one of
[1:17:30] these days I'm gonna wine my way record
[1:17:32] back around to it do you do you realize
[1:17:35] what that is that is a dangerous place
[1:17:38] to be because that's like that little
[1:17:41] boy that told the governor that they
[1:17:43] told the governor I don't have time for
[1:17:44] you right now God is the one the
[1:17:47] bridegroom is the one that does the
[1:17:48] calling he's the one that does the
[1:17:50] calling and draw and and one day one day
[1:17:53] he might get tired of you he might get
[1:17:56] impatient with you and just turn away
[1:17:58] and and your leave you with a cold a
[1:18:01] drawn up hard heart that can't be
[1:18:03] touched by the gospel anymore do you
[1:18:06] realize one of the greatest gifts in the
[1:18:08] world that one of the greatest gifts is
[1:18:10] to hunger and thirst for righteousness
[1:18:11] for they that hunger and thirst for
[1:18:14] righteousness shall be filled so when
[1:18:16] you feel that little knock on your heart
[1:18:19] when you feel that little tug on the
[1:18:21] range of your heart then is the time
[1:18:23] dopant up don't put it up on the shelf
[1:18:25] and say one of these days I'm going to
[1:18:27] get to it one of these not now but one
[1:18:29] day I'm
[1:18:30] come back around to it and open up the
[1:18:32] heart one one day I'll get back to it do
[1:18:35] you realize what you're saying one day
[1:18:36] I'm gonna get back to God one day it's
[1:18:39] like it's like you get a phone call from
[1:18:41] God and God says I want to give you the
[1:18:43] Holy Ghost and you say I know I'm gonna
[1:18:45] put you on hold right now I'm gonna put
[1:18:48] the God of glory on hold and you hang up
[1:18:50] on the Lord you don't hang up on the
[1:18:52] Lord of glory you don't hang up on the
[1:18:55] governor now when you get that call from
