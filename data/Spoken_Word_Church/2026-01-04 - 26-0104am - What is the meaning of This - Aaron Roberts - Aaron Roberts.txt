TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Amen. God bless y'all this morning. I uh I got called in to do double duty today. [snorts] It's good to be in the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Good to have brother David and Sister Laura with us this morning as always. And before we get started, let's just all bow our heads and speak to the author this morning. Heavenly Father, we thank you for this time, Lord, to come to your house, Lord, together, Lord, and ground around your word. And Lord, we thank you for all your blessings on us. And we just pray that you bless this service this morning, Lord, as we endeavor to look into your word, Lord. We just pray that you come speak to us this morning, Lord. Give us what we have need of. Bless our brother David as he comes to bring the word to us this morning. And Lord, just give us what we have need of. And Father, bless each part of this service. We commit it all to you in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. This morning, uh going to go to the book of Deuteronomy, chapter 6, and uh begin at verse 18. [snorts] And uh scripture says, "And thou shalt do that which is right and good in the sight of the Lord, that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest go in and possess the good land which the Lord swear unto thy fathers, to cast out all thine enemies from before thee, as the Lord hath spoken. And when thy son askketh thee in time to come, saying, What mean the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, which the Lord our God hath commanded you, then thou shalt say unto thy son? We were Pharaoh's bondman in Egypt. And the Lord brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand. And the Lord showed signs and wonders great and sore upon Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his household before our eyes. And he brought us out from thence that he may bring us in to give us the land which he swore unto our fathers. And the Lord commanded us to do all these statutes to fear the Lord our God for our good always. And that he might preserve us alive as it is at this day. And it shall be our righteousness if we observe to do all these commandments before the Lord our God as he hath commanded us. And this morning I uh y'all might find it a little funny this morning. Um I entitled this what is the meaning of this? And uh for those of us that were together yesterday at brother Kern's house. Uh we were we were playing this little game and uh you're trying to give hints to words and you're trying people are trying to guess the words and uh it was quite funny because um it's very hard to come up with the right words because if you you're trying to give hints but the problem is if you give if you give it too easy it's not hard to figure out what the word is. So then but if it's too vague then nobody has any idea what you're talking about &gt;&gt; and you know and and so you know it's like it becomes a real struggle to understand some of these things but you know we as when you're when you look at it because I I got I was playing the moderator and so uh here I am trying to give definitions to words and trying to give clues and hints and and the more I the more I had done it, the more more confused people look sometimes. And then um but it's like well if if I was if I made it real easy, [cough and clears throat] y'all wouldn't I mean it just you know you're not playing the game because you're making it too easy on everybody. But uh so it was a little bit of a struggle trying to play this game. But it was so funny because people kept getting closer and closer and closer. But it's like well they're not seeing it. But see but you're getting closer every step of the way. And you know, I was I was reading here in the in the scripture. I was thinking about that last night. And I was thinking about what brother Chris Long had was preaching on the other day when he was talking about the books, the one book, two books, and the you book. &gt;&gt; And you know, when you when you begin to look at it, it's you in that book. You are that book. And you begin to see yourself in that book. And the one thing he was talking about at the beginning of the of the sermon when he kept talking about the symbols in the scripture, you know, we we're confused by the symbols and we don't understand the symbols. But you know, over time they become become clear because the more you see yourself in the word when you see yourself then it becomes more clear to you because you're seeing Christ and you're seeing Christ in you. You see in the word then it becomes more clear to you. So the symbols are not u so confusing but you're beginning to see more. And when brother Chris was ministering afterwards I told him I said I what comes to my mind is uh the mission impossible. Some of y'all remember the old Mission Impossible uh when uh when Peter Graves would come up and he would just speak to somebody on the street, you know, he just walk up to somebody and he would speak to them and you know, it's just a common mundane kind of conversation. They would say something and he would say something and then the other person would speak and if you were listening to that conversation, it would mean anything to you. I mean, it's just normal, mundane, common conversation. But the problem was is when he's speaking to that person and that person is responding that he knows there is a secret that's being conveyed between the two that nobody else sees. But it's only those two that are speaking understand. And then when he speaks the right word, then he tells him, you go here and you find what you're looking for. And that's when he went and found the, you know, the cassette player. But, you know, he had, but he had to go through those steps to bring him to the place that he needed to come to. &gt;&gt; And so, you know, you see how how that works. And, you know, I was talking about that because, you know, brother Brandham talked about that mystery. You know, God had a had a a mystery, a secret mystery hidden in the back part of his mind that he kept secret, but the mystery didn't become known until he began to convey it. See when you know because we didn't see even though he spoke through the prophets through the old throughout the whole Old Testament and he began to speak to through the prophets people didn't realize that was God and in in human flesh before the people &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; you know sometimes they missed it because you know I mean it's you know they're up there and they're talking thinking that God was behind badger skin God's in in the tabernacle He's he's in the holiest place and he's in there. It's like, well, don't let don't let him speak. But God stood in in the human flesh of Moses speaking to them. &gt;&gt; There was there was God speaking to them. And they're like, "Don't [clears throat] don't let God speak to us. Moses, you speak to us." Well, it was God speaking through Moses to them. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And they missed they missed that God was speaking to them here. Here he was speaking to them and they murmured and complained against Moses and not realizing that's God's mouthpiece. That's God, human flesh to them and he's speaking to them and trying to help them along the way and they miss what what has happened. Here's God with them all the way. Every time they failed, every time they murmured, every time they complained, no matter what happened, it didn't change God's plan. He still was with them. He was still encouraging them. He was still leading them. He didn't stop, but they missed that God was with them. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Here's God leading them the whole way, &gt;&gt; you know, and and he tried to, you know, lead them all the way, show them that they were going into the land of promise, but because of their unbelief is what held them back. And here in Deuteronomy chapter 6, I I I always like this one because Deuteronomy chapter 5, in Deuteronomy chapter 5, we read the is the reading of the Ten Commandments before they go into the promised land because they're reading he's leading them back to the because in Exodus 20 is when God give them the ten commandments, but in in Deuteronomy 5, he's speaking to them in of the uh giving them going back over the law and giving them the word again. And then in chapter six here as they as they're leading again and they're saying why why does he bring these things up and it says that you may know what is right in the sight of the Lord for you to do these things and it says you know why why are we following all these things because these are the laws of God to lead us into the land of promise &gt;&gt; and and so and it's like he's giving you the same opportunity give the children the same thing he gave to their fathers. Their fathers didn't stay with the word. The fathers didn't go all [clears throat] the way, but the children are here and he's giving them the same law and he's giving them. He said, "So why do we have these testimonies?" Because God was faithful to his word, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; He led them all these. Why do we have these testimony? Why do we have these statutes and the judgments which the Lord our God commanded you? because he promised Abraham and he came to the children of Israel and he brought them out of the land of bondage. And the scripture says he says, "And thou shalt say unto thy son, we were a Pharaoh's bondman in Egypt, and the Lord brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand. And the Lord showed signs and wonders, great and soore upon Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his house before our eyes. and he brought us out from thence that he may bring us in to give us the land which he swear unto our fathers. So he's showing them that now is the time of going in and he's showing all these are the things that took place. Now you know here they are seeing these things and they were wondering where God was for so many years. you know, we're we're the we're the chosen people of God and here they are bondsmen, you know, death and destruction and all the things they faced and it's like where is God in all this? Then when God comes on the scene and he show he showed the miracles, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; He done all the miracles, the signs, the wonders, and it was to encourage them. It wasn't for everybody else. It was to encourage them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But you go back and listen to the Philistines. you go back and listen to the other the other tribes that were there when when Rahab when they crossed into the into the promised land and Rahab's in there said you know we when we y'all crossed over we we heard what God done in Egypt our hearts melted with we had no fight in us &gt;&gt; we we we we didn't we didn't have no place to stand &gt;&gt; we were not going to make it if your God can do those things we didn't have a That's right. &gt;&gt; But you know what? God spoke to them. And it wasn't for the world, &gt;&gt; but the world took it. There was some all those tribes, all those nations saw that it's like, "Wow, this God's powerful. He's going to lead them through. He's going they're going to overtake all this because it was promised. And look what all the things that have taken place. All 10 all the 10 gods of Egypt. He destroyed every one of them. He showed that they were powerless. Right. &gt;&gt; Everything that every every plague that come upon Egypt was showing that their gods were powerless &gt;&gt; and showed everyone every god that Egypt had. God showed his power &gt;&gt; and overtook them. And and not only that, see, Moses went out there and began to tell them, said, "Listen, the river is going to turn to blood. There's going to be darkness. &gt;&gt; There's going to be frogs. the locust and everything's coming. But you know, he spoke it before it came to pass, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; He warned the people and told them said, "Listen, if your God's powerful, then let him stop it, but the God of heaven spoke and said, "Listen, y'all going to face these things." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And they saw it and they saw the Egypt saw the destruction, but the children of Israel saw God was faithful to his word. &gt;&gt; Right. But you know all those times when all that they faced all those things and when the darkness came and all that there was light in Goan. There was safety in Goan. They had protection in Goan. &gt;&gt; And then when it came for their time then all of a sudden all he had to do was they had to follow what the word said. Right? &gt;&gt; Just come follow what the word said. And then here he is. He's leading them out. It's time for you to get ready. It's time to get ready because we're seeing things take place. &gt;&gt; And all of a sudden, it's like, "Hey, get your shoes on. Get your staff in your hand. We got we got a we got a getting out of here meal to eat. &gt;&gt; There's a roasted lamb. There's unleavened bread. We're time we're time to feast." &gt;&gt; And people didn't see that. Hey, we're going we're going to take all this lamb. We're going to roast it. We're going to eat it. and we gonna get out of here. And the whole time they're so worried about what was going to take place. What what's what's the what's the neighbors think? What's what's the nations around us think? What what No, God was encouraging the whole time, showing them it's time to get ready to go. And it's it is such a wonderful thing to see that that God has has allowed us to see these things just like them. It's time to get ready to go. And you know, he led them out all this through this journey, bringing them through. God was faithful to them the whole time. You know, I I I get I get down in myself sometimes. And maybe y'all don't. I do. You know, &gt;&gt; I I you know, as brother Dale used to say, you have your little pity parties. &gt;&gt; And uh but you know, I go back and I I I love I love reading the Old Testament. Brother Donnie says, "I preach out of the Old Testament all the time." I was like, "Well, I find myself there many times." And &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And uh I I really en enjoy reading because you know, you see these people and you and you think, "Why why do these people struggle with all of this?" When you see when you've seen the supernatural take place, when you've seen the miracles, when you've seen what God's promised you and it comes to pass and we still we still struggle with these things, it's like, why why are they struggling with this? It's like why why why didn't they just have bold and be faithful and just you know rest in God and everything like that and then I sit and and when I face things in life and I think you know what because I'm human too &gt;&gt; just like they were human &gt;&gt; and it's [clears throat] like well you know I've got I've got him on the inside &gt;&gt; and I still struggle &gt;&gt; I still have doubt &gt;&gt; and you That's the reason if you get into the word, you know, he comes and buys and he speaks to you and he he shows you. He encourages you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hey, this is this is for you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Just like they struggle, but you know what? God was faithful to them. But he rose up a group. There was a faithful group that rose up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you know what? They went all the way. They put all the things behind them. Here's a here's a group that ra rose up and they didn't they didn't worry about well our fathers done this and our fathers done that. They failed. But there was a group that rose up that were going in to take the promise that the promised land. They weren't held back by those things and the word came to them and they took the word and it's like listen this word is for me and so this is this is what I'm going to do. And you know, brother Brandham said, you know, God sends send sends things our way sometimes for us to do certain things. And then he said, then we will see that God has proved what he said he was to that person. And then God testifies the thing the person testified of. So things happen in our lives that God sends things our way. He wants us to do things. You know, he was talking about non going to the going to the river to Jordan and baptizing. He said, "Well, Nathan didn't have to go to the to the water to be baptized to dip seven times." But that's what that's what the prophet told him to do. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; You know, Elijah could have told him, said, "You're clean." And left. But was he going But would he have faith to believe what name what Elijah told him to do? Would he have faith to go to the water and get baptized? Would he would he actually go dip seven times when he went out there and says, "We got better there's better rivers to dip in than the Jordan. &gt;&gt; Who would want to go in that? I mean, this is dirty water." He's like, "Well, do you do you want to get clean?" You know, the young servant girl said, "My Lord said, 'Well, if you know, if he told you to do some great thing, if you had if you had to go do some great that was very hard to do and and difficult and time consuming, would you?" Oh, yeah. I'd do that. Would you go down there and dip in the river seven times? Oh, yeah. It's like, well, you know, he had to humble himself to go step in that muddy water and dip seven times. And when he did, then the Lord come on the scene and cleanse him just like just like the prophet told him to do. And see you see all the way through and there's there's many many scriptures but you know I I think about the children of Israel you know as as they go and and their journey and and not only then but after they come into the promised land you know they still have issues they still have problems and you know they continue on and and it goes right back to the same thing and you know I was reading about about when Samuel when when Samuel was the prophet and they came in and [clears throat] God began to speak to Samuel as a young man and you know he had never heard the voice of of God before and Eli told him said listen when you hear that he said just speak to the Lord here am I right &gt;&gt; and hear what he had to say &gt;&gt; and you know when when God began to speak to Samuel you know he was troubled at what God told him. And you know, he was standing there one day and he it was like he was he didn't know what to do in the situation when God spoke to him. And Eli told him, he said, "What did the Lord tell you?" And he said, "Don't hold anything back." He said, "God do to you and more if you hold anything back." back and he told him, he said, "Because judgment's come upon your house because of your sons and the iniquity that took place and you've not done anything about it." And you know when when God came and to them and God began to speak to Samuel about the word of the Lord and become and the scripture tells us that later on it says that he began to grow and God began to speak to him. And it says and the word of Samuel came to all Israel. This is 1st Samuel chapter 4. And it said, "Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle and pitched beside Ebenezer, and the Philistines pitched an Aph. And the and it says, "And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel. When they joined the battle, Israel was smitten before the Philistines, and they and they slew of their army in the field about 4,000 men." And here's this battle going on. And what was interesting is here in the in the scripture that you'll see it says, "And the people were come into the camp. The elders of Israel said, "Wherefore the Lord has spitten us today before the Philistines, let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the Lord out of Shiloh unto us, that when it cometh among us, it may save us out of the hand of the enemies of our enemies." And so they go and get the ark of the covenant and they bring that into the camp. But you know the one thing that you find out in the reading of the scripture, the the children of Israel when they're when they're fighting against the Philistines, they never consult Samuel. There's not one time they consult Samuel in all this. But the leaders decided, hey, we're gonna go get the ark of the covenant &gt;&gt; and we're gonna bring this we're gonna bring the ark of the covenant in. And there's and there's they had all this great rejoicing that was that the ark of the covenant was brought into the camp and the Philistines were hearing it. And the Philistines were afraid. It says the Philistines were afraid when the when the ark of the covenant came in. But you know later on when they when they rose up to fight after after the the children of Israel had the ark of the covenant with them and the scripture says and the Philistines fought and Israel was smitten and they fled every man into his tent and there was a very great slaughter for there fell of Israel 30,000 footmen. So the first battle they lost 4,000 and it's like oh we're just going to go get the we're just going to go get the ark of the covenant and bring it in the camp and they set the ark of the covenant up and then there was a great slaughter beyond that and everybody's like everybody begins to wonder what what happened what happened and you know that's when the ark of the covenant was taken by the Philistines [cough] and it was brought unto Dagen And you know, we know the god dagen was broken up into pieces and all that and God smoked the people &gt;&gt; because they had taken the ark. But you know, when they took the ark of the covenant, the people's like, "Well, we just got we just got the ark. We've got the word. We we've got this this covenant here. We're showing this." But that's not what helped them. &gt;&gt; When the prophet was there, they never consulted the prophet to see what to do. And it's just like because later on after after they went through all of this and they're still in battle and they're still they're still under this attack and they're losing. And then finally Samuel comes to him one day and tells them. He said the only way that you're going to get this is if you come back to the word and repent. &gt;&gt; There's a time of repentance. You must come back to this and then if you will hold to the word then God will deliver you. But if you don't, then you're still under this under this you're still under this bondage. You're still being attacked. And you know, and then when they came, then God was able when they began to cry out to Samuel for deliverance, to turn back to God. Then that God was able to deliver them. And so, you know, many times in our lives and other people, you see, you know, it's just not just taking the word, but it's actually taking the word and applying it to ourselves and holding it. And it takes it takes a life of repentance. It takes a life of humility. &gt;&gt; Because if we if we're not humble before the Lord, then all this is is not going to help us &gt;&gt; toing a Bible and reading a Bible. &gt;&gt; But, you know, it's saying the right thing. Yes. &gt;&gt; And not and and believe in what God says and taking in what God said. And Lord, try me. Create in me a new heart, a clean heart. Lord, help me that I got I have all of these battles and and many things that we're facing, but you know what? The same God that delivered them is with us today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And you know, today we see we see the wars and rumors of war. We see all these things happening. But you know what? I thank God for one thing. We're starting a new year. That puts us one day closer to the coming of the Lord. &gt;&gt; We are one day closer. &gt;&gt; And you know, we see the things that are taking place, but praise God that we see these things. You know, we know tomorrow's headlines today. As brother Ernie used to say all the time, what a wonderful time. What a wonderful day to live in. &gt;&gt; What a wonderful place to be in. And you know you and if you know what the word says. I I thought about sister Hattie, right? Hearing the word go forth. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; The words went forth and we've heard the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And all and all she done was she said one thing. That ain't nothing but the truth. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; I believe that. &gt;&gt; Yes. And just as brother Chris was talking about the that little boy playing in that house, when he began to look, he saw that mirror and he's like, "Hey, that's me. I identified me. That's me. I see myself. I see the day and hour which we live." And I realize this is for me. This is mine and I'm going to speak it and I'm going to claim it. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; It's like, well, you you may have the hardest battles you've ever had this year, but you know what? You're gonna have the greatest victories &gt;&gt; you've ever had this year. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's it's a great thing. This is going to be our our starting of a new year. We got opportunities. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Many times we we think, well, we just got more more problems and more struggles and, you know, a lot more questions and everything. But you know what? We still have the answer. Right? &gt;&gt; Jesus is the answer to every question in life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he's still on the throne. And he said he's going to lead you and guide you. He said, "Lord, I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world, to the end of the age." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That's encouraging to me. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. when the when no matter how no matter how the devil comes in, attacks, whatever comes our way, you know, praise God, we we know who who to run to. We know that we're encouraged. We know where to stand. It looks confusing to everybody else, but you know what? It's not confusing to me. Praise God that God has given us a light to see. He's given us a word that that speaks to us and shows us who we are. &gt;&gt; And if you you wonder what the meaning of things are, you take it to God. You get in the word and he'll show you what these things mean. &gt;&gt; I'm so glad I'm so glad he gave my life meaning &gt;&gt; because without it, we wouldn't we wouldn't know what where we'd be at or what to do. &gt;&gt; But thanks God we know. You know it's because you know many people that they want to be you ask people you know they want to be rich and famous and and all these type things and you know they have certain things that they want. I want to be faithful to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to be faithful to his word. &gt;&gt; That's all that's all I want in this life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want I want to be all that he wants me to be. And that's the greatest that's the greatest accomplishment we we can have in this life. Amen. But God bless you this morning.
