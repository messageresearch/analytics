[0:00] from some 85 I was reading in this song
[0:08] and it said that Israel they limited the
[0:14] Holy One and I think the same thing
[0:19] happening with us that we limit what God
[0:22] can do cause we get to more of our stuff
[0:25] out the way the more of the God can come
[0:27] in there was the prophets that he says
[0:30] the more william branham i can get out
[0:33] of the way the more of god and come in
[0:36] so let us just surrender however all
[0:41] unto Jesus Christ and then let's pray
[0:45] Heavenly Father as we go this morning
[0:48] God we praise your Holy Spirit is
[0:51] abiding in every heart
[0:53] while the let us forget about all things
[0:55] except your Holy Spirit as we invite you
[0:58] in Lord to bless us and to guide us
[1:01] every thought that we have low ask you

[1:10] receive we should bless brother Dale

[1:16] that it's hard to surrender on to your
[1:19] holy words and your bringing forth unto
[1:20] him that he may deliver it to us in
[1:23] Jesus Christ's name we pray amen

[1:42] captivity of Jacob thou has taken away

[10:55] then we'll come back after coming in but
[10:57] will we want
[10:58] cover the whole thing look what he says
[11:02] be glad then you children of Zion and
[11:04] rejoice in the Lord your God for he has
[11:08] given you the former rain moderately and
[11:10] he will cause to come down for you the

[11:33] and the pummel worm my great army which
[11:36] I sent among you so you may be seated
[11:39] the Lord at his blessing to the reading
[11:41] of the word now we'll get back and just
[11:42] read the whole thing but we had a little
[11:48] time last night speaking about some
[11:50] things but I'm doing in the wind my wife
[11:53] we were listening to when I was speaking
[11:55] there when was it a couple weeks ago or
[12:00] whatever anyhow the last time I
[12:02] ministered and she is trying to count
[12:05] how many times I have spoke the word
[12:07] revival and she said you said that 70
[12:12] something times I said well we were just
[12:16] kidding the cover what we're listing the
[12:18] things you didn't count them all because
[12:20] he counted them more now but anyhow I
[12:23] said well there's one thing for sure I
[12:25] want the people to understand what I
[12:27] believe and that way you can't say well
[12:30] why did brother Dale believe I preached
[12:32] one time for about an hour and 15 20
[12:35] minutes hour and a half on manifestation
[12:38] of sons and daughters of God and a
[12:40] certain brother went home to eat lunch
[12:41] with us that day and the first thing he
[12:44] said you don't believe in manifestation
[12:46] sons of God do you I said I've spent an
[12:52] hour and a half
[12:53] telling you how much I did believe in
[12:56] and what it would be you know well I
[12:59] don't know whether he slept through that
[13:01] or what but I hope you don't miss it
[13:04] but I want to make sure you understand
[13:06] to what I'm saying and what I'm
[13:09] expecting
[13:11] cause as one firm believer you know in
[13:15] the message of the hour that we believe
[13:18] that and the Bible that we try to study
[13:20] from that you know we're living in the
[13:25] most marvelous day of all right they've
[13:29] never been a day as great as this day so
[13:34] why would anybody think it's what I went
[13:37] through where the Prophet would say the
[13:39] revival for America is over did you turn
[13:44] God down in 57 and you know it's over
[13:47] for America no more world wide sweeping
[13:49] revivals we'd like that that was right
[13:53] but didn't say to somebody you say
[13:55] something battle revived revivals are
[13:57] all over we don't believe in revival
[14:00] it's all over well then the Prophet said
[14:03] in the sealed book during the third seal
[14:05] he said the bride hadn't had a revival
[14:08] yet didn't take them seven unknown
[14:09] thunders to wake her up well then I hope
[14:13] you understood what I'm trying to bring
[14:15] see there's revivals revivals revivals
[14:20] the word brother Branham would have not
[14:22] he said we've had a great revival this
[14:24] week well that was just in that place
[14:29] but then he would talk about a revival
[14:31] and looking forward to the revival
[14:35] looking forward to something great to
[14:37] take place and I guess you think that
[14:41] all down to time and all of the things
[14:44] that has happened and all of the great
[14:46] revivals that has been and you think I
[14:49] guess we're just going to go out of here
[14:50] and rapture one day which is the
[14:52] greatest event or change of these bodies
[14:56] the greatest event that could be ever
[14:58] thought of the most important event
[15:02] event that could ever be thought of
[15:04] other than Calvary to make place a way
[15:07] for that to take place and to think that
[15:10] we're going to end this up by just
[15:12] turkey ology just by thoughts and ideas
[15:16] you know then you say well revived one
[15:21] angle minimal revival you just you just
[15:23] believe it in a revival you
[15:24] understeer the people up I would to God
[15:27] I could stir you up I would do God we
[15:32] could all get stirred up why not what's
[15:36] the problem but as I was trying to bring
[15:39] out now see each age I want to read all
[15:43] the scripture together everyone say a
[15:44] little bit see each age it came down
[15:50] according to what we read here in jaw
[15:53] and coming on through and knowing that
[15:57] it says there would be a form of rain
[15:58] and a lot of rain all right now that's a
[16:03] gospel that's not just rain pouring down
[16:05] that's natural to say it for over there
[16:09] you know for for planting Co when we
[16:11] planted the garden this time you know it
[16:13] was great we got some rain all right
[16:16] that's wonderful all right let's see now
[16:18] the there'll be many rains all the way
[16:20] through because that's not all
[16:22] oh but then they'll come a time that
[16:24] would be called the latter rain or the
[16:26] life's rain just as you're putting on
[16:29] your crops and they're beginning to grow
[16:31] and mature so you can get it up to
[16:33] certain sizes like corn and all as it
[16:36] begins to come in forming the corn on
[16:38] the to the to the cob you know it needs
[16:42] a rain and that would be a lot of rain
[16:46] right not to that that's a form of rain
[16:49] and a letter right right now it's never
[16:55] been and it's not anywhere that to
[16:58] fulfil jaw in the fulfillment of what he
[17:01] says until this day right now follow
[17:06] what I'm saying
[17:06] because he said they'd be a former and a
[17:09] lot of rain in the same month in the
[17:12] first month all right now don't run that
[17:18] is to say well the former rain would be
[17:20] this year in April cuz that's their
[17:23] first month and then next year in April
[17:25] little bit don't go that way that shows
[17:27] how smart you are but it doesn't show
[17:29] how intelligent you are
[17:31] this shows how smart ethically we can be
[17:34] to try to say things to make it look
[17:36] like we know something
[17:38] just why don't you put it like it is
[17:40] there's never been a place anywhere that
[17:43] you can cover former rain and lighter
[17:46] rain in the same month
[17:47] there is no crop that grows that away
[17:51] you don't plant one thing and then
[17:55] gather it within a month you know you
[18:00] don't even plant plants and get it your
[18:01] month you know you know you don't get
[18:03] that it's just not dark so it's showing
[18:05] you in the gospel the is taking that to
[18:10] bring it to this day as well read in a
[18:13] minute and come in this day is the only
[18:15] day that you'll ever have to work that
[18:18] you would have the form of rain and the
[18:20] latter rain in the same month we'll get
[18:25] to that in a minute now what is a Ryan
[18:27] it's a form of rain is the teaching rain
[18:30] right in the gospel now former rain is
[18:34] the teaching rain the planting of the
[18:36] word just like you would plant your seed
[18:39] into the ground all right yeah and then
[18:42] you get a little moisture on it but then
[18:44] latter rain is to reveal that or quicken
[18:48] that to you or to make it alive all
[18:51] right now the Lord Jesus spoke pains
[18:53] years ago two thousand years ago he
[18:56] spoke many things but it didn't come to
[19:01] Pais right then even though it was a
[19:03] form of rain but it's waiting to a time
[19:06] to quicken our harvest of that rain all
[19:11] right now so each church age and what I
[19:14] trying to get to the other day the each
[19:16] church age at a former rain which was
[19:19] the minister that you know like paul
[19:22] iranians paul martin Columba luther
[19:25] wesley elijah each age has a former rain
[19:29] a message that goes forward in each age
[19:33] had a ladder rain to quickening that
[19:36] that was taught by the messenger of that
[19:39] age all right and each age in itself now
[19:44] now that's where you're gonna have to
[19:45] listen too closely he's aging itself
[19:48] then had a revival
[19:51] are you going to say some of the ages
[19:54] didn't have a revival a year
[19:55] you're not knowing what a revival is
[19:57] you're thinking of a revival as to be a
[20:00] great outpouring a great shouting of
[20:04] great manifestations of great things
[20:07] that have taken place and that's fine
[20:09] but that's not a revival revival revival
[20:15] is not as we brought out the other day a
[20:17] revival is not for the center
[20:20] you can't revive a sinner a revival is
[20:26] for those that are in you already got a
[20:30] house something then you fall away and
[20:32] then you can be revived back to that are
[20:34] as we'll covered in it you can be
[20:37] restored because that's going to be what
[20:40] we're talking about today
[20:42] restoration brings revival run
[20:48] restoration brings revival all right now
[20:52] follow that down through all of the time
[20:55] and you can look back behind and see the
[20:57] pyramid and the ages and the messenger
[21:00] in the days of the Apostle Paul he had a
[21:04] teaching reign to the first church age
[21:07] which was his message all right
[21:10] and then God made that alive to the
[21:14] people of that age all right that was a
[21:17] lot of rain to that okay it was a
[21:21] quickening or making it alive to the
[21:23] people would you realize that that's
[21:25] been being made alive of what he said
[21:28] has been being made alive for 2,000
[21:31] years right you read the Apostle Paul
[21:34] now and God quickened that and revealed
[21:38] it to you it's being made alive to you
[21:41] all right
[21:42] it's being brought into manifestation of
[21:46] reviving you and I because a revival of
[21:50] said it's not the center heat you get to
[21:53] people rejoicing and happy and getting
[21:56] them to come to the altar and repenting
[21:58] and crying out under God and that's why
[22:02] sinners start coming because
[22:04] they see what's taking place then the
[22:08] center comes and he gets saved all right
[22:10] did he becomes a part of the group all
[22:14] right and see that's the revival so do
[22:17] you understand what I'm saying ever
[22:18] Church aids had a row at a time that
[22:21] they received a message every Church age
[22:24] at a time that that message was made
[22:26] alive and that would be the revival of
[22:30] that day in that time all right and it
[22:35] would come down through the ages and
[22:37] then as it would it would come down to
[22:39] the life stage as we tried to bring out
[22:44] here while back about the ages and the
[22:46] thing it would come down to this age
[22:48] being a special age comes in this age
[22:53] now in this age typing as it would back
[23:00] when the children of Israel went into
[23:02] the land of Canaan you realize as they
[23:06] went into the land of Canaan they were
[23:08] actually reaping the harvest they didn't
[23:12] have to plant right they reap what was
[23:14] our but you realize they could turn
[23:16] around and plant immediately the muna
[23:22] they ate to natural land they could say
[23:24] with that all the old corn of the land
[23:26] because that's in the scripture right
[23:30] when they entered Egypt I mean you know
[23:32] when they went into the land of Canaan
[23:34] they're coming out of Egypt they ate of
[23:39] the old corner of the land right which
[23:44] is a deeper meaning of the word of God
[23:46] true is that that's your prophets
[23:48] explanation we see the only time that it
[23:51] could take place anything that would
[23:53] look that way would be when the Israel
[23:57] went into the promised land and they ate
[24:00] of the old corn there surely they were
[24:04] saying growing dire that they could eat
[24:06] but they didn't have to plant it but
[24:08] when they got there ate they ate the
[24:10] mature
[24:11] corn as we call it food of the land that
[24:15] had been stored up
[24:16] but then immediately they had to plant
[24:20] you see yeah but that's that's latter
[24:23] rain on the former and that's what the
[24:27] Prophet says me it has to come to a time
[24:32] that not only are you getting former
[24:35] rain teaching right and latter rain it
[24:38] comes to a time is you're going to get a
[24:40] lot of rain with a former right right
[24:44] it's in the basically discernments in
[24:47] case you miss it you want to know get it
[24:49] laying up here but I just want you to
[24:50] think about it me that each age had its
[24:57] own revival
[25:01] now follow me not necessarily a
[25:04] worldwide sweeping he's aged had revival
[25:11] for the message of that age of
[25:14] quickening of making live see that's the
[25:19] kind of revival I'm talking about I'm
[25:22] not talking about it we're wide sweeping
[25:24] revival to work everybody knows and all
[25:26] of the great things that took place
[25:28] Azusa Street was the last one of those
[25:31] to the Gentiles the two witnesses going
[25:36] to Israel there'll be a great revival we
[25:39] covered it even brother Otto said in the
[25:42] years of his ministry that he had a 15
[25:44] year revival going on but he said it's
[25:48] going down and that was before the
[25:53] opening of the seal
[25:57] we'll get to that later on in the
[25:59] message but just think about it now how
[26:03] could it fall former and latter rain in
[26:05] the same month it would have to be a
[26:11] planting and quickening real quick right
[26:15] all right so watch that now now let's go
[26:18] back and read the scripture and pick up
[26:20] what is talking about and you'll see
[26:22] this pointing right down to this day
[26:25] alright follow it down to this time now
[26:29] look and you shall eat in plenty and be
[26:32] satisfied goes back down to 23 be glad
[26:39] then your children of Zion which is the
[26:42] bride right we know this is natural
[26:45] Israel and he's speaking off right but
[26:49] that's the type of the Bride of Christ
[26:51] because we are their spiritual Israel we
[26:55] are the children of Zion all right said
[26:59] rejoice in the Lord for he had given you
[27:01] the former rain moderately and he will
[27:04] cause to come down for you the rain the
[27:06] former rain and the latter rain in the
[27:09] first month right there's going to be a
[27:12] great thing happen in this life stage
[27:16] but what did we read in what we talked
[27:19] like when we're speaking like but run
[27:22] said to be so humble until you miss it
[27:27] I'm talking about a revival not that
[27:30] everybody in the building is running all
[27:32] over the place
[27:32] I'm talking about a reviving of the
[27:35] revealing of the word that you can sit
[27:40] right beside of somebody and God can be
[27:44] revival taking place in your heart and
[27:46] the person next to you know nothing
[27:48] about it
[27:51] that's the revival I'm talking about yet
[27:54] it will come to a great time now watch
[27:57] it in the Bible then come to a great
[28:00] time if we can't read it the scripture
[28:02] win that shape all right your calls to
[28:05] come down for you the rain the former's
[28:07] a lot of rain in the first month okay
[28:09] this is the only age that can take place
[28:13] because when it comes to this age God
[28:17] can sew down and reveal real quick where
[28:23] as I said about Paul look at Paul Paul
[28:25] spoke back dire these things fall Paul
[28:28] spoke that mankind has read about and
[28:32] preached about but has never come to
[28:34] Piyush right all said to be changed a
[28:38] moment at winking them and I dead in
[28:40] Christ shall rise first we which are
[28:42] alive and remain
[28:44] that hasn't taken place yet but what
[28:48] about when it can be preached in taking
[28:50] place and quicken it right then there's
[28:53] what we ought to be paying attention to
[28:54] well and when that happened look what he
[28:57] says and the floor shall be full of weak
[29:00] and the fat shall overflow with wine and
[29:03] oil like I said when children of Israel
[29:06] entered into Canaan land that's exactly
[29:10] what they found they were capable of
[29:15] taking and eating the old corner of the
[29:18] land read your scriptures I used to
[29:19] preach all of that we should probably
[29:21] said it's a deeper revelation and with
[29:23] God's Word you remember they had manna
[29:27] while they were in the wilderness you
[29:29] remember that manna fell every day in
[29:32] the wilderness but when they entered the
[29:34] land of Canaan and tasted to that old
[29:36] corn to land the manna ceased revival
[29:41] the manna ceased why because it become a
[29:45] stronger meat comparing it to the old
[29:48] corn of the land because it was in the
[29:51] land of Canaan so they could not only
[29:53] eat that bread but they could plant that
[29:57] bread that they could make bread out of
[30:01] they were capable of planting so now you
[30:04] got it all in the same month now you
[30:06] understand see then watch when they
[30:08] entered Canaan where it was it the
[30:10] floors were full of wheat and fat shall
[30:12] overflow with wine and oil now that
[30:16] happened naturally to Israel right it's
[30:21] got to happen spiritually to me and you
[30:24] when the rain comes in the same month to
[30:27] us all right now follow it now watch
[30:32] what he says now you're going to have
[30:33] all this rain you're going to and you're
[30:35] going to have the old floor into the
[30:36] wine and oil and he says and I will
[30:40] restore
[30:46] who you the years that the locust has
[30:49] eaten they can't go on the caterpillar
[30:53] the Palma worm my great army which I
[30:56] sent among in thanks talking about a
[30:58] restoration a restoration when would
[31:04] that take place they go back in the
[31:07] first part of Joel and you'll see that
[31:10] he says there's going to be a cackler in
[31:11] Palmer which is really you know yourself
[31:14] by looking at its four stages of one bug
[31:17] right
[31:18] it's the cankerworm Palma worm glow
[31:20] Krishna caterpillar it finally winds up
[31:22] to be a great beautiful butterflies we'd
[31:24] call it in the stages of the others the
[31:27] local but then it starts right back over
[31:29] and it's just a little bug it's the
[31:32] Esther that or the other right or to
[31:35] know that you know why I'm saying locust
[31:37] got it and watching he says my army
[31:41] which I sent among you now he didn't
[31:45] send the cankerworm pond warm locusts
[31:48] and caterpillar he allowed it to come he
[31:52] permitted it to come so don't go off and
[31:54] say God sent it that's not God's army
[31:59] who get the God's army in a minute
[32:02] that's not God's army he never said
[32:05] those things he permitted them to come
[32:08] into being to where they could be a time
[32:12] that he could restore it remember my
[32:17] thought restoration brings revival
[32:22] so thank now and look what he said
[32:25] during that time though he's talking
[32:30] about a restoring he talking about all
[32:32] this plant and all this other things
[32:33] about it then he starts to restoring to
[32:37] you order note is pointing down to this
[32:38] day are you following me and you shall
[32:42] eat in plenty and be satisfied and
[32:44] praise the name of the Lord your God
[32:46] that help dealt wonderfully with you and
[32:48] my people shall never be ashamed listen
[32:51] and during that time of restoration and
[32:55] you shall know that I am in the midst of
[32:57] Israel and that I am the Lord your
[33:00] odd and none else and my people shall
[33:02] never be ashamed look now what does it
[33:07] say when that comes to pious when it
[33:14] comes to pipes look what he said and it
[33:18] shall come to pass afterward after the
[33:24] restoration but now you're going to
[33:29] catch all and I hope what I'm talking
[33:30] about we're going to talk about a
[33:32] revival as being the restoring of the
[33:35] word but then we're going to get to see
[33:39] what it turns out to be in the end time
[33:43] where it can be in the same month so
[33:45] listen real careful and pay attention
[33:48] it shall come to pass afterward and I'll
[33:52] pour out my spirit upon all flesh and
[33:54] your sons and daughters shall prophesy
[33:56] your old men shall dream dreams your
[33:58] young men shall see visions all right
[34:03] that took place to natural Israel of the
[34:09] outpouring of the Holy Spirit under
[34:11] their Pentecost to the natural Israel
[34:14] but then the cankerworm palm warm locust
[34:17] and the caterpillar came in right after
[34:22] revival I asked her the upper room
[34:25] experience after the five the three
[34:27] thousand after the Holy Ghost being
[34:29] poured out on the day of Pentecost then
[34:33] they can't come when palm warm locusts
[34:34] the caterpillar started and ate it down
[34:38] that's why it's promised in the last
[34:40] days huh look in this life stage what
[34:43] it's going to be and it shall come to
[34:45] pass afterward after the content can
[34:51] worm worm locusts the caterpillar has
[34:52] been put down after what they ate away
[34:55] has been restored then it's going to be
[35:05] bring it down to this day you can bring
[35:10] it down to where you can bring the Holy
[35:12] Ghost being poured out on those Oh
[35:13] sister
[35:14] and that's exactly right but remember
[35:17] they can't go wearing pom warm locust
[35:19] and Caterpillar we're concerned with if
[35:21] you'll read restoration the right tree
[35:23] you get the message that those bugs that
[35:25] we're concerned with is the ages where
[35:27] the denomination's ate it down and God
[35:32] would have to restore right so let's get
[35:36] down to where we're living Israel is
[35:41] only type of where we're living look and
[35:43] upon the servants and upon the handmaids
[35:47] in those days will I pour out my spirit
[35:49] now you get over in the scripture and
[35:51] said if well my handmaids and my servant
[35:53] are look and I'll show wonders in the
[35:56] heavens and the earth blood and fire
[35:58] coming down to where we're at now and
[36:00] fillers are smoke and the Sun shall be
[36:04] turned into darkness and the moon into
[36:05] blood before the great and terrible day
[36:08] of the Lord coming down to where we're
[36:11] at and it shall come to pass we're in
[36:18] the end time that whosoever shall call
[36:22] on the name of the Lord shall be
[36:24] delivered or in Mount Zion Mount Zion
[36:29] has always been the bride and in
[36:32] Jerusalem which this message will go
[36:34] straight on the Israel when we leave out
[36:36] of here and they'll get their time
[36:39] she'll be deliverance as the Lord has
[36:42] said in the remedy and the Lord shall
[36:45] call a great day is promised the
[36:53] cankerworm pollen worm - locusts
[36:54] caterpillar all that to Israel forget
[36:57] that come down to where we're at read or
[37:01] listen to the message restoration of the
[37:03] bride tree and you'll hear him talking
[37:06] about what the message is left the
[37:07] Baptist say when two bad days left the
[37:10] Pentecostal a etc you talking about the
[37:12] cankerworm pond warmed locusts and
[37:14] Caterpillar being in our age and our
[37:16] time now what's that in a minute in our
[37:20] day in our time is where we're to be
[37:23] concerned with what happens to Israel
[37:25] that Rapids of Israel
[37:27] we remember all of that is going to
[37:29] happen to Israel when they are restored
[37:33] they're going to have a great revival of
[37:36] a restoration right why would he say I
[37:42] will restore the years of the locals
[37:44] come because it means they came and ate
[37:47] away and the restoration is going to
[37:52] come as each church age had a message
[37:57] that I started off each church age had a
[38:01] message down to time they've always had
[38:03] a gospel they've always had a quickening
[38:06] of that I'm making a live of the word of
[38:10] that age and that was their revival that
[38:15] didn't stop the great revivals for
[38:18] coming that only spoke of it showing
[38:22] what would take place
[38:23] in Paul's day they can't go whereupon
[38:26] worm low because the caterpillar hadn't
[38:28] got started yet it was just started in
[38:29] his day to eat it down but it has been
[38:35] restored in this day in restoration
[38:39] don't bring revival what are you talking
[38:41] about would it not be satisfactory to us
[38:46] as Christians to believe that in the
[38:49] days of the Apostle Paul that he could
[38:51] stand out and speak and God could reveal
[38:54] the secret things that were hidden
[38:57] before the world to those people and
[39:01] that would be so great until it still is
[39:05] taking place today
[39:09] George it was a revival in the days of
[39:12] Paul for you to hear his message and God
[39:17] revealed to you what are you talking
[39:19] about get in your Hebrew series get rid
[39:22] of that on the Godhead and the things
[39:24] and study your Bible and listen to Paul
[39:27] as he's bringing those signs and
[39:29] remember he's bringing it back dark but
[39:31] it's still taking place today the
[39:34] revival and I listened you understand
[39:35] what I'm getting at the revival I'm
[39:38] talking about
[39:39] started with the Lord Jesus preaching
[39:47] the gospel the latter rain started by
[39:52] the Holy Ghost quickening that on the
[39:56] defini coast and making that word alive
[39:59] and the people's heart right that's the
[40:03] greatest revival that's the revival I
[40:05] want all the other revivals see that
[40:08] does away with all of that emotional
[40:10] shouting and glory hallelujah as you
[40:13] call a revival you can work that up
[40:15] amongst people any time right like we
[40:21] were talking about life night the
[40:23] fivefold ministry there's a lot of you
[40:28] that a minister comes in a different
[40:32] ministry from what I use and you're so
[40:36] happy and clapping and shout at a minute
[40:39] tolerance and when I preach you go we
[40:43] know what that don't make me upset you
[40:50] might think it does it no because see I
[40:54] happen to know people and what causes
[40:57] you to kick so just remember shout all
[41:01] you want to now quote the Prophet which
[41:06] is make sure you walk straight when you
[41:08] come down right shouting glory
[41:13] hallelujah I have mine I don't have to
[41:17] show it all the time I have my rejoicing
[41:21] but nobody knows it with me he said well
[41:24] why don't you try to get us to rejoice
[41:26] well when you get what I'm talking about
[41:29] and you catch on to what I'm talking
[41:32] about that the opening of the word is
[41:34] the greatest revival that could ever
[41:37] happen to anybody in this world
[41:41] the opening of the word will raise the
[41:43] dead heal the sick and do all kind of
[41:46] thing your shout and glory hallelujah
[41:48] won't do it you say are you acknowledge
[41:52] that's where you go at it see you say
[41:54] well brother Dale you don't believe in
[41:55] being emotional you're wrong and one day
[42:01] you'll find it out I spoke times here
[42:06] from this pulpit to try to get you to
[42:08] see and then I withhold from speaking
[42:10] why it's like I was telling them last
[42:14] night the different ministries at God
[42:19] uses brother phone he's not counted to
[42:23] be a prophet he's an evangelist but God
[42:27] can use any ministry the way he wants to
[42:31] out of the five fold right and use them
[42:34] for one time and then they'd not have to
[42:35] work the mower ride I've told you God
[42:41] told me that brother Anderson and sister
[42:44] Anna was going to have a baby I didn't
[42:47] tell nobody
[42:48] why don't you go tell it if this God is
[42:52] going to come to PI then I don't have to
[42:55] worry about it and if you don't believe
[42:57] that something takes place and I walk
[43:01] out here and I say the Lord showed me
[43:03] that to eSchool oh he's just trying to
[43:05] prop up like he trying to make it look
[43:07] good
[43:07] I don't believe he done advise you I'd
[43:09] go somewhere else because I'm a liar
[43:12] it's not true and you would not be
[43:16] following a liar is that sensible if
[43:20] that's the way you think about the
[43:21] ministry you ought to go somewheres out
[43:24] but see the Lord showed me that and I
[43:27] never said a word that nobody never said
[43:28] a word to brother for me where the phony
[43:31] got then anointing under it and got the
[43:32] preaching real good that night and he
[43:34] turned and walked down the aisles write
[43:36] about some where brother Aaron to that
[43:37] and our stood brother and sister
[43:39] Anderson
[43:40] the story was brother Anderson's firm
[43:43] count was so low until he couldn't have
[43:46] any children they'd been told that they
[43:50] go to the same doctor I go to
[43:52] I mean I'm screwed
[43:56] they're their family doctors my my
[43:58] doctor I talked to him about them
[44:03] brother poni walked right down the aisle
[44:05] and he stopped and he said God is going
[44:08] to give you that baby and you know what
[44:14] the baby came I don't have to have all
[44:19] of that yeah but if you'd have told it
[44:21] we could have been happy
[44:23] no you wouldn't believe it no more you
[44:27] wouldn't believe it in the moon if you
[44:29] tell us what no you wouldn't leave it
[44:31] come on let me tell it why not leave it
[44:34] alone I've got something right now that
[44:36] the Lord showed me and I'm waiting for
[44:39] it to be made manifest but then what it
[44:41] is I'll tell you about it if you don't
[44:43] believe it then you wouldn't believe it
[44:45] if I told you for it happened that's the
[44:50] little things we were into the ministry
[44:51] life because listen what am I talking
[44:53] about
[44:54] what's a revival Rodela revival to come
[44:58] we're all shout and glory hallelujah and
[45:00] we're running the hill just that's a
[45:02] Pentecostal revival can unquote run
[45:06] around him he said well we over no no
[45:12] you're wrong when you say I don't
[45:13] believe in it
[45:15] I've told you things that happening but
[45:18] do you believe it I told you when the
[45:22] Lord told me he was going to give them a
[45:24] deer to where I could talk to it you've
[45:28] got to hang on his wall down to this
[45:29] house you're gonna go by that and look
[45:30] at it I told you about how as I sitting
[45:38] up on a deer stand way back in the woods
[45:41] and here comes this smelling perfumes or
[45:44] wonderful down through the woods and I
[45:47] get all plum upset about it I did I said
[45:50] Here I am Lord trying to have way to do
[45:53] something where I can talk with him and
[45:55] showing this you leading and then here
[45:57] I'm trying to hunt and hear some crazy
[45:59] female he's out here in the woods
[46:02] spraying perfume all over the place
[46:06] I'm serious I'm not always knowing
[46:10] what's right you know what I've done I
[46:12] got down off the trees and I laid my
[46:15] deer stand down and I laid down on the
[46:18] ground and I pouted for an hour or so
[46:22] and then when they come up
[46:29] Walt overlooking the back of a truck the
[46:31] big old beer distilled back of it up I
[46:33] looked at my brother my aunt said
[46:35] where'd you get it at he said I didn't
[46:38] get it he said Wade got it how do you
[46:44] think I felt me asking God to do
[46:48] something he's doing it the whole time
[46:50] and then me satin imparting and feuding
[46:52] about it because it didn't happen my leg
[46:56] you'll find out one of these days God
[47:00] don't do to our ways we do to his why
[47:03] can't you believe that a revival sure if
[47:06] shouting sure that's what I'm getting to
[47:09] come on get to the end of the message
[47:11] and we'll back up and what does it say
[47:14] after the cankerworm pommel worms
[47:17] locusts the caterpillar is eating it
[47:20] down to bug he's going to restore that
[47:22] then after it's restored
[47:24] he's going to send an outpouring of the
[47:26] holy spirit is that what I've always
[47:31] taught you brother branham said after
[47:34] the door the Gentile church is closed
[47:35] God willing knowing a church and doing
[47:38] one year what theologist tried to do in
[47:40] 2000 but he said he's doing it now why
[47:43] cause revivals were taking place that's
[47:47] why you can't follow brother Branham and
[47:49] ended unless you get it put together
[47:51] running in the latter rain this
[47:53] afternoon to sit down for a while and
[47:54] read all the things he says he'll tell
[47:57] you the Pentecost word had a ladder rain
[47:58] you'll tell you the Baptist was having
[48:01] the ladder running you tell you always
[48:03] having a ladder right but then he'll
[48:06] turn around and say you say latter rain
[48:08] spoken word read mercy he says you had
[48:10] the former running yet he talking about
[48:13] something else right that word of those
[48:17] seals and things came after
[48:20] what we're reading the seco to remember
[48:22] what he said in there as of yet Malachi
[48:24] 4 is not fulfilled it had to be a sewing
[48:28] name come on I quote with him he said
[48:31] the world has been soaked down these are
[48:34] the denomination has sewed it down he
[48:37] said and the word has been sewn pure and
[48:41] unadulterated from any denomination is
[48:45] that only spoken word Regency didn't
[48:48] read that lately I'd invite you to at
[48:50] least listen to it he says I have yet
[48:54] Malakoff over we see Malachi for then
[48:56] had to be so damned what do you think
[48:59] brother I'm done the revealing of that
[49:04] that he's so down is your lighter rain
[49:08] with the Bible said remember the other
[49:11] day asked of rain in the latter rain
[49:16] that's raining like crazy yesterday
[49:19] right day before it's rain like
[49:21] everything here and then you stand out
[49:22] the artsy Lord sending some rain I don't
[49:27] sound too good does it sounds like you
[49:31] kind of mixed you marbles somewhere up
[49:33] Stars not what the Bible says asked of
[49:37] rain in the time of the latter rain
[49:40] it didn't say of the time of the former
[49:44] why can't you believe and expected
[49:48] rather unsaid
[49:50] he said one of these days they'll come
[49:52] such an outpouring from heaven that'll
[49:54] fill every fiber of our being and take
[49:56] us in the rapture I've been quoting that
[50:00] fifty years wanting somebody to catch it
[50:06] that's why I said I've been in the
[50:08] greatest revival ever since I've been in
[50:10] this message I've been in a constant
[50:12] revival I'd like for places with some of
[50:17] you ever once in the one that wouldn't
[50:19] sometimes I'll go brother Gary Atkins we
[50:21] used to talk a lot because he kind of
[50:22] experienced that you ever been at the
[50:25] time when you go for two or three months
[50:27] and you don't feel the presence of God
[50:32] you ever been that way if you go for a
[50:36] while don't feel the presence of God you
[50:39] won't try preaching every Sunday with
[50:40] that kind of a feeling you're welcome to
[50:44] have it you want to try preaching when
[50:47] you don't feel its presence and all he
[50:53] gives you is one word and you preach for
[50:55] months and months and months and the
[50:57] best you can get out of it hey brother
[50:59] Dale this repeats itself you better
[51:02] believe I do and you better believe I'll
[51:05] keep on do it cause you know another one
[51:07] to walk up and say brother Dale keep on
[51:10] repeating cuz winters repeat income I
[51:12] finally get what you're talking about
[51:14] well now which one of my folks listen to
[51:23] you see what a revival is to me the
[51:27] revival is receiving God's Word and it
[51:32] being quickened into my heart
[51:35] rejoicing outward emotions is what
[51:39] you're calling a revival come on I can
[51:43] quote to you know I can quote a man that
[51:46] was sitting on the pulpit looking at a
[51:48] lady outside and she was shouting like
[51:52] every time you remember your prophet
[51:55] telling that he said I was gonna get
[51:58] down and go down there and set her down
[52:04] you remember that one do you remember
[52:08] the rest of the story when he went down
[52:11] to set her down he got to shouting -
[52:19] he's like I've done that lanta one time
[52:21] this brother said something I've seen he
[52:23] was running around around in the church
[52:24] and he every time he appreciates run
[52:26] around you know really red-nosed him
[52:28] because are you sitting next to him and
[52:30] he just you know Peter a just I said
[52:33] brother just don't stop I might run into
[52:35] you he said but I've never seen you most
[52:40] of you ain't never seen the emotion you
[52:43] never see me sit down
[52:44] a gun was standing 20 feet away me
[52:49] rejoicing over what God had revealed to
[52:52] me see revival is not the outward
[52:58] emotional thing that's what you call the
[52:59] revival the revival is the restoration
[53:02] of God's Word inside of you that will
[53:05] outwardly produce emotional things about
[53:17] it what do you expect see people think a
[53:25] revival is a great rejoicing and like I
[53:28] said you mean to tell me that you don't
[53:31] believe in emotions you mean to tell me
[53:34] I've been quoting that for years it read
[53:36] around and said God will pour out of
[53:39] there's a blessing upon us one day and
[53:42] fill every fiber of our beings you mean
[53:45] we're not going anywhere to go and set
[53:46] that glow - hallelujah that's why I
[53:50] wonder does he ever to reveal yourself
[53:52] to you I'm sorry if I'm sitting back are
[54:01] you'd buy the right get up here and say
[54:02] the same thing to me you can't tell by
[54:07] the emotions on people's face where the
[54:09] God's revealing things are not the one
[54:12] you think is not getting it might be the
[54:14] one that's getting and the rest of them
[54:16] are not getting come on we got the old
[54:21] shoulder on you take a wagon old wagon
[54:24] you go out in the field and boy it makes
[54:27] a lot of racket don't it clanging the
[54:32] bang which you load it down with good
[54:34] watermelons and you come pulling that
[54:37] load of watermelons you got very little
[54:38] racket so maybe the load and down of the
[54:42] wagon might be better off than the going
[54:45] on car empty-handed what are you
[54:49] following the layout of the scriptures
[54:50] the layout even to Israel is what the
[54:56] cankerworm pom world locust and
[54:57] Caterpillar
[54:58] going to be restored to Israel one day
[55:00] that's been eating away and when it is
[55:05] they're going to have a revival it's
[55:09] going to be a rejoicing now listen how
[55:11] long is it going to be rejoicing to
[55:13] Israel and a revival you don't think I
[55:22] thought according to my understanding
[55:25] and a three and a half year period that
[55:27] 144,000 we're all going to be killed you
[55:31] don't have much choice revival going on
[55:33] when you get them killed for what you
[55:35] believe course you know how people
[55:42] believe that that's where I was reading
[55:44] that we're gonna set our Creed's and
[55:45] their dogmas and things is what's
[55:46] keeping the revival away you remember
[55:48] that all for the see a book when we've
[55:50] read it look great man in this message
[55:55] set one day and talking to me and he
[55:56] told it in the church he said that
[55:59] 144,000 ain't gonna be killed
[56:01] I said well according to your prophet
[56:06] that you claim he said that I'll be
[56:08] killed and according to the Bible it
[56:12] says they'll be killed but you know one
[56:15] the people sitting around never heard
[56:16] that they still believe brother
[56:19] so-and-so well then that kind of person
[56:24] ain't gonna have a revival I'm talking
[56:26] about I'm talking about a restoration a
[56:33] restoration
[56:39] a restoration that would restore all
[56:41] things and then you tell me that's not a
[56:44] revival a restoration what does that say
[56:54] you got the locusts came upon worm
[56:56] caterpillar is it true off a restoration
[57:01] of the bride tree the Prophet said what
[57:03] for death messengers took it down
[57:07] cankerworm pond worm locust caterpillar
[57:10] got it laying here if you want to read
[57:11] it matter of fact you can go ahead and
[57:13] pull it up you want to pull it up on the
[57:15] restoration of rod tree and let him just
[57:16] repart it while I'm talking
[57:22] they said for death messengers ate it
[57:25] down he said for life - injures will
[57:29] restore it
[57:34] What did he say those life messengers
[57:36] were he said Luther was one of them the
[57:44] just shall live by faith was a life
[57:47] messenger to restore he said Wesley was
[57:50] a life messenger to restore because he
[57:53] brought sanctification
[57:54] he said Pentecostal with the gifts and
[57:58] the baptism of the Holy Spirit was the
[58:05] number three and he said in the number
[58:08] four is what the word now if you have
[58:14] one and two and don't have number three
[58:16] it's not too good right you've now
[58:19] justification and sanctification and not
[58:21] how the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[58:23] you're not very much valued right in the
[58:27] Lord but if you have justification
[58:29] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[58:31] Ghost to bring you to a new birth and
[58:35] then the word comes you've got the
[58:38] capability of understanding and how to
[58:40] grow into the statue of a perfect man
[58:42] right though the years of the cankerworm
[58:47] Palmas and locust and Caterpillar would
[58:50] see you won't listen to the restoration
[58:52] of
[58:52] Rhodri the way I do because I can read
[58:59] you the direct quotes or what I just
[59:01] said is justification same face the
[59:07] baptismal goat and then the word and
[59:10] then brother random turns around and he
[59:12] says what the mess that is left the
[59:17] Baptist ate what the Baptist left the
[59:22] Pentecost was eight he's bringing
[59:25] another four stages of the bug that's
[59:29] not in the dark ages into coming down
[59:31] when it went into the ground he's
[59:34] bringing it into our day of the
[59:38] preachers and the people of this message
[59:40] that are cutting this message to pieces
[59:45] it's not too messy this church this time
[59:47] it's the Methodist doctrine it's not the
[59:51] Baptist Church it's a Baptist doctrine
[59:56] you take any of these doctrines you want
[59:59] to we'll talk about it all afternoon any
[1:00:01] of these doctrines you've gotten a
[1:00:03] message if you'll give me a little time
[1:00:05] we're thinking it'll come out to show
[1:00:07] you that some denomination had that idea
[1:00:12] the Mormon doctrine of pre existence is
[1:00:17] identically to the SIB to soul doctrine
[1:00:20] that the people of this message that are
[1:00:22] big portion of we're blinded by that of
[1:00:24] the true soul doctrine you've got a lot
[1:00:30] of people in this message that live
[1:00:32] really low shouting glory hallelujah and
[1:00:34] that's wonderful but that's the message
[1:00:35] this idea you got a lot of them just dry
[1:00:40] hide and don't believe nothing that's a
[1:00:42] good Lutheran or pinnacle or
[1:00:45] Presbyterian or something not even that
[1:00:48] Presbyterian they was more emotional you
[1:00:54] see one gone man
[1:00:56] see it's this message then
[1:01:00] as this message has been sold down in
[1:01:03] your heart from the message of the hour
[1:01:06] and the fivefold ministry bringing that
[1:01:10] message so that was the question was a
[1:01:12] flight now how did the fivefold ministry
[1:01:14] fit into the perfecting of the Saints I
[1:01:16] said because they're supposed to preach
[1:01:18] what the Prophet preached and they
[1:01:20] preach what the Prophet pretended to
[1:01:21] bring together then the opening of the
[1:01:25] word and that's the greatest revival
[1:01:28] that we could want the greatest revival
[1:01:34] that could ever be it was how much the
[1:01:40] other day in Hosea when he said after
[1:01:43] two days he said in the third day see
[1:01:46] you try to figure that out you probably
[1:01:48] put third day and you'd be
[1:01:49] mathematically off when you go back to
[1:01:51] what the Prophet said that third day
[1:01:53] started when Hosea said it which was 780
[1:01:56] BC so you're right now in the third day
[1:02:00] from Hosea and he's promised a brides
[1:02:04] revival a bride to be taken out of here
[1:02:06] and Israel to receive their message
[1:02:17] restoration brings you back to the faith
[1:02:22] of the fathers that right
[1:02:26] restoration brings you back to the full
[1:02:29] restoring of the Word of God now listen
[1:02:33] to what I'm saying then where would you
[1:02:37] follow by trying to cover the word then
[1:02:38] because the word never fell away in the
[1:02:41] last days like we're saying word fell
[1:02:45] away back down under this restored under
[1:02:50] luther wesley and the baptismal holy
[1:02:52] ghost
[1:02:53] look at the people of this message
[1:02:55] that's destroying the Word of God by
[1:02:58] their ideas and their quotes it surely
[1:03:01] needs a restoration
[1:03:04] it needs to be restored back to us what
[1:03:07] the Prophet is saying but yet who wants
[1:03:13] what the Prophet is say it
[1:03:16] restoration brings a revival that's what
[1:03:24] it said here in jaw closed after that
[1:03:30] time it says I'll pour out my spirit on
[1:03:33] all flesh what are you expecting brother
[1:03:36] Dale I'm expecting two things to get
[1:03:38] worse and worse and worse as we go along
[1:03:40] in the natural but you mean I thought it
[1:03:45] out for 50 almost 50 years ministry and
[1:03:48] then come down in the end time and one
[1:03:49] of cabbies down to some kind of a little
[1:03:51] thing and not believe the full Word of
[1:03:55] God I'm looking for a revival in the
[1:03:59] people's heart of this word that has
[1:04:02] been preached by the prophets and
[1:04:04] brought unto us and to be brought by the
[1:04:06] fivefold ministry and he said I'm
[1:04:07] breaking it down in big nuggets and I'm
[1:04:09] gonna let the ministry take it and bring
[1:04:12] it on down now that's his words you said
[1:04:14] but we don't need the fivefold ministry
[1:04:16] I can get it by myself
[1:04:17] show me the Bible I challenge that on
[1:04:20] the basis of God's Word out there on the
[1:04:23] internet or anywhere in the world send
[1:04:25] me a quote send me a word and says you
[1:04:28] can get it yourself without the fivefold
[1:04:30] ministry you say you shouldn't talk like
[1:04:34] that why not show it to me you can't
[1:04:41] find it coated ain't docker the Bible
[1:04:44] says the fivefold ministries for the
[1:04:45] perfecting of the same that's what
[1:04:47] you're not looking at it like we did
[1:04:48] last night you realize the fivefold
[1:04:51] ministry is not non spiritual guilt
[1:04:54] anybody can operate in a non spiritual
[1:04:56] guilt with the fivefold ministry is a
[1:04:59] predestinated guilt to the church to
[1:05:04] bring her to perfection
[1:05:07] those don't believe it okay time with me
[1:05:10] and the problem like I said it don't
[1:05:15] bother me for you to shout when all
[1:05:17] these four
[1:05:17] for the preaching and their preaching
[1:05:19] simple things and you shouting about it
[1:05:21] then I preach and you don't child that
[1:05:23] don't bother me it just knows for sure
[1:05:25] one thing you ain't catching what I'm
[1:05:27] talking about
[1:05:28] so when you catch on well I'm talking
[1:05:31] about with both shout we'll have a good
[1:05:33] time well what do you think only end up
[1:05:37] then when the word is fully restored to
[1:05:40] the bride of Jesus Christ according to
[1:05:43] Joel when the word is fully restored in
[1:05:46] other words when this message is
[1:05:48] revealed to the bride of Jesus Christ is
[1:05:51] a full restoration back to not just the
[1:05:56] face of the father's but back to the
[1:05:59] Lord Jesus Christ and the word he
[1:06:01] brought which was six seals in Matthew
[1:06:03] 24 that's got to be restored not
[1:06:09] restored in the basis that it was here
[1:06:11] to start with no but in the restoration
[1:06:16] it's going to be brought back to you and
[1:06:18] I so why call it restoration because
[1:06:21] technically it's not restoration because
[1:06:24] technically it was never here are you
[1:06:31] with me
[1:06:33] technically it was never here nobody
[1:06:35] ever preached anything about the seals
[1:06:37] oh there were people that read times and
[1:06:39] said we bad this had the sixth seal I'm
[1:06:42] going to sit in on in the sixth chapter
[1:06:45] of Revelation we had the six sealing
[1:06:48] knew that that was a Tribulation Period
[1:06:49] would you read down but are you
[1:06:54] following me
[1:06:56] restoration is to bring back what was
[1:06:58] formerly here now can you understand
[1:07:02] what I've tried to say it's in 1969 when
[1:07:07] the first message I preached was the
[1:07:09] bride of Jesus Christ would be the son
[1:07:12] of man the Word made flesh in a mini
[1:07:15] membered body that your prophet said
[1:07:18] would be and he said the Godhead is not
[1:07:20] complete without you
[1:07:22] why can't we believe that
[1:07:29] we then is to restore what Jesus had not
[1:07:34] did it fell away because nobody didn't
[1:07:36] know anything about
[1:07:36] so now let's call it another word let's
[1:07:40] don't call it restoration of the message
[1:07:43] of the hour to bring the seals to the
[1:07:45] right of Jesus Christ let's don't call
[1:07:47] it restoration let's call it revival
[1:07:56] come on
[1:07:57] let's call it revival when the faith of
[1:08:01] the fathers were preached back by the
[1:08:02] property that was restoration that don't
[1:08:04] mean everybody understood it was our
[1:08:06] ain't talking about it
[1:08:08] then he went home to fulfil Malachi 4
[1:08:12] because there's another part of Malachi
[1:08:14] 4 first part was to turn the hearts of
[1:08:17] the children back the second part was
[1:08:19] what reveal those seven thunders which
[1:08:22] is contained in the seals in his
[1:08:25] divinely revealed mystery truths that
[1:08:26] literally turn this back so Jesus is
[1:08:30] ministry of the seals was never here
[1:08:34] until the Prophet preached you know he
[1:08:37] preached yourself nobody preached in
[1:08:39] between you followed me so that's not in
[1:08:41] restoration it's in a revival you at
[1:08:52] least grinned or shook her head or said
[1:08:55] something when I said Paul started off
[1:08:58] with a messenger to his age and his
[1:09:00] message was a form of rain and then to
[1:09:04] quicken it to the people would be
[1:09:06] calling it latter rain you remember that
[1:09:10] when I first started that Paul each
[1:09:13] church aged messenger had a message
[1:09:15] that's a form of rain and the people
[1:09:18] caught that message and it was a lighter
[1:09:20] rain that day are you listening
[1:09:27] you're not shaking head you might be
[1:09:29] condemned because remember you our own
[1:09:31] video buys you I just shape it up
[1:09:35] sometimes because I've instructed them
[1:09:38] back there too every once in a while
[1:09:39] scan the audience
[1:09:42] wouldn't be good brother dick when you
[1:09:43] got that on the right man what about
[1:09:47] when you sound asleep they turn that
[1:09:48] video around and are you this call and
[1:09:54] your own internet around or you are the
[1:09:57] things you brothers have stand up here
[1:10:01] and new brothers at any singing anything
[1:10:02] or anybody you ought to think about what
[1:10:06] you're saying because you're on internet
[1:10:14] okay what you see Church this message
[1:10:22] are you listening the message that the
[1:10:26] Prophet brought which was his message to
[1:10:28] begin in 63 when he said not in the
[1:10:31] years of preparation and all these other
[1:10:33] fight he said but when he begins to say
[1:10:35] on there's no restoration to them
[1:10:40] because it was never here mankind never
[1:10:45] told him why don't you call it a revival
[1:10:54] why don't you call it planting of the
[1:10:56] word and how they can come in the same
[1:10:59] month and how you can listen to a tape
[1:11:02] and right there right while you're
[1:11:04] listening God can quicken what is being
[1:11:07] said there's your former and latter rain
[1:11:09] in the same month the same time now it
[1:11:13] can be fulfilled not restoration not
[1:11:21] Reclamation's why don't you call it a
[1:11:26] revival
[1:11:31] long brothers why don't you call it a
[1:11:34] revival and say brothers I'm having a
[1:11:38] revival because that's what brother Dale
[1:11:40] is talking about I'm talking about it
[1:11:43] this message goes forth in God quickens
[1:11:45] it I am being revived as you become part
[1:11:57] of the word now let's see them to get it
[1:12:01] Easter seal you become the word as you
[1:12:04] receive the word this message they
[1:12:10] brethren brought to us his message is
[1:12:13] not a restoration it's a revival it's
[1:12:22] the Word of God coming straight from
[1:12:24] God's lips not the man God's lips in the
[1:12:30] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[1:12:31] when it begins to sound the mystery of
[1:12:33] God that will be completed it's the same
[1:12:40] thing as Moses words when he walked out
[1:12:42] there he had the message right he spoke
[1:12:45] the message and it took place right he
[1:12:49] didn't have to say what somebody else
[1:12:50] said he had the message the prophets
[1:12:56] message began in the opening of those
[1:12:58] seals and went through I'll give you the
[1:13:00] quotes of it not in the years of the
[1:13:04] healing the message it followed the
[1:13:07] healing the greatest ministry that has
[1:13:14] ever struck the world started in this 63
[1:13:21] somewhere right in there I back up a
[1:13:23] little bit 62 similar as he began to
[1:13:29] head in towards his message and as you
[1:13:34] begin to bring his message that message
[1:13:38] had never been preached by anybody but
[1:13:41] the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:13:47] that was what he whipped to top off and
[1:13:51] looked down in all of those statements
[1:13:56] the gospel struck the world not as a
[1:14:02] restoration now quote it but as a
[1:14:08] prophet saying I say unto thee is that
[1:14:17] what he was doing that message
[1:14:21] straightened out all the errors and
[1:14:23] things that the Prophet had called in
[1:14:25] his early ministry through the opening
[1:14:28] of the seals and they're coming down and
[1:14:35] there was the message of the song man
[1:14:41] you remember back a few months ago when
[1:14:44] I was preaching about it's a son of man
[1:14:46] there's the only solar of the seed you
[1:14:50] realize brother branham so due to the
[1:14:53] end time as a gospel there's got to be
[1:14:58] my life if not why do you bring it well
[1:15:03] that ain't for us like a big man this
[1:15:05] message that said that third pulling
[1:15:07] things said that that's only for her
[1:15:09] brother branham and the Lord Jesus will
[1:15:11] then glory hallelujah that sure leaves
[1:15:13] the rest of the world I out don't I
[1:15:20] don't agree with that I want you to know
[1:15:24] what I don't agree with it I want you to
[1:15:27] know that I believe that when this
[1:15:29] message is fully made alive in you and I
[1:15:31] they'll come a baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:15:34] to prove that word is right when the
[1:15:38] Lord Jesus had preached his message he
[1:15:41] told them to go to the upper room and
[1:15:42] wait shut up don't preach don't do
[1:15:46] nothing set up a lake then the Holy
[1:15:50] Ghost came and he says now I send you
[1:15:56] of the world with a message that a
[1:16:01] message which was a revival in their
[1:16:03] heart
[1:16:04] when is this message going to become a
[1:16:06] revival to you you see why the ended
[1:16:17] okay let Stan what is a revival it's a
[1:16:24] person that the word has been made alive
[1:16:27] to the shouting glory hallelujah is a
[1:16:32] manifestation of that is that right the
[1:16:37] shouting glory hallelujah is not the
[1:16:40] revealing of God's Word it's supposed to
[1:16:43] be a manifestation because of the word
[1:16:47] being revealed I hope you listen oh yeah
[1:17:00] it's a little Christmas song Wendy joy
[1:17:06] to the world
[1:17:10] [Music]
[1:17:12] better PC her team let every retire and
[1:17:25] heaven in nature what about it a revival
[1:17:37] and then an outpouring to prove you
[1:17:42] didn't revise with me just remember the
[1:17:49] world will be shouting - you think
[1:17:57] they're sounding your secret is sounding
[1:18:01] God leave only thing I didn't finish but
[1:18:09] I want to make a final statement because
[1:18:12] it says there about this time of
[1:18:15] rejoicing one he said I'll pour out my
[1:18:17] spirit upon all flesh your sons and your
[1:18:21] daughters my run said God is on one of
[1:18:25] them my sons and daughters my but he
[1:18:27] said the other is the devil's children
[1:18:30] now listen in the upper room when the
[1:18:34] Holy Ghost failed there was a hundred
[1:18:37] and twenty true seed Judas had done left
[1:18:41] he's off the same it wasn't the Devils
[1:18:44] children and God's children in the upper
[1:18:46] room back dire it's the last days when
[1:18:50] he pour out his spirit upon all flesh so
[1:18:54] there'll be a great revival take place
[1:18:55] you watch it there's little flare-ups
[1:18:59] every once in a while little little
[1:19:00] things happens they would one down here
[1:19:02] in Florida a few years ago that they had
[1:19:04] revivals for two or three years just
[1:19:07] service after service that's the one
[1:19:11] that it's kind of understand you started
[1:19:16] rejoicing and you started having a good
[1:19:17] time and people gonna come see the fire
[1:19:19] burning and you know what they might get
[1:19:21] happy you say you're looking for the
[1:19:24] world
[1:19:24] I'll go to random said and even Israel
[1:19:30] would see God come in for the bride and
[1:19:33] they would think that he's coming after
[1:19:36] them which said wrong time any time then
[1:19:44] you mean you think it's going to be a
[1:19:46] worldwide sweep and revival you let
[1:19:48] America get desperate and she'll go to
[1:19:50] her knees as it goes through knees God's
[1:19:55] going to send a revival but it's not far
[1:19:57] them remember a revival is not for those
[1:20:00] that are lost a revival is for those
[1:20:02] that are born again the true Bride of
[1:20:04] Christ will be having the great revival
[1:20:06] the others will be shouting in the
[1:20:08] aftereffect
[1:20:10] listen I'm 77 years old I walked in a
[1:20:15] Baptist Church in short range and
[1:20:17] remember as a kid of how people would be
[1:20:20] crying out for God to bring a revival
[1:20:24] I've seen women walk down into woods not
[1:20:27] out like we do you know and get down
[1:20:29] walk out in the woods for chicks and
[1:20:31] sugars and snakes and everything was
[1:20:34] dark down behind the cemetery on one
[1:20:36] side and the men on the other and crying
[1:20:38] out for God to save the people you know
[1:20:43] what we was doing we were shouting in
[1:20:46] the after effects of the Pentecostal
[1:20:49] revival that was done dying down
[1:20:54] well they'll shout one day but it won't
[1:20:57] be far then it'll only be for the little
[1:21:00] bride because she'll know why she shout
[1:21:09] listening to a tape the other day where
[1:21:11] brother Brennan said those poor brothers
[1:21:13] he called his brother's name when I
[1:21:15] won't do it but he said that poor
[1:21:17] brother said he went down and preached
[1:21:19] in that Catholic Church right what he
[1:21:22] called it to synagogue he said that
[1:21:25] priests come over the priest and his
[1:21:27] church that sounds good I've done it you
[1:21:33] know what he said
[1:21:34] he said it's wrong you say don't go out
[1:21:38] there and preach to them now he didn't
[1:21:39] do that remember at the same time he
[1:21:41] said what he said he was going to the
[1:21:43] denominational churches and preaching to
[1:21:45] him so don't get you smart attic brain
[1:21:47] to running just listen
[1:21:51] that man was trying to get them people
[1:21:54] to join together with him both sides was
[1:21:57] trying to get him joined together it
[1:21:58] wasn't just Rutter Branham going to a
[1:22:00] preacher and preaching in a church he
[1:22:02] was doing that every day he wasn't
[1:22:04] against that he was against what that
[1:22:06] man was do it because that man was
[1:22:08] joining the two together you mean if
[1:22:13] they call me up and they say brother
[1:22:14] Dale we want you to come up here and
[1:22:16] preach for us I'll be glad to go
[1:22:18] anywhere any denomination Catholic
[1:22:19] whatever

[1:22:23] said okay now let's just kind of
[1:22:25] compromise a little bit let's get this
[1:22:26] and we'll come out and preach for you
[1:22:27] too

[1:22:34] whole world is going to experience the
[1:22:38] religious world is going to experience
[1:22:39] your revival but it'll only be the shot
[1:22:43] and glory hallelujah for them but to the
[1:22:45] bride she'll be going right down the
[1:22:46] road and she'll walk off here
[1:22:50] you know there's a go right on can I
[1:22:52] quote the prophet claiming to receive
[1:22:54] the Holy Ghost is that the way he said
[1:22:56] it did he say that they'd go on claiming
[1:23:00] to receive the whole to go after the
[1:23:01] rapture has taken place and said
[1:23:05] there'll be some little something will
[1:23:06] happen and said they'll say but we
[1:23:08] thought this was going to take place and
[1:23:14] said there'll be a little voice speak
[1:23:16] and say it's happened and you missed yet
