========================================

God bless you Saints good to be in the house of the Lord I hope you come expecting today I did and uh as we're we're continuing on our little study of Hebrews 137 and 8 remember them which have the rule over you um just get my slide shared here and I I sure appreciate all all the prayers this week um you know I just had had a little surgery this this week to get some things fixed up so thank the Lord all is well and I appreciate all all the phone calls and texts and everything um it's it's good to know you're loved so appreciate you very much Lord Jesus we just thank you Lord God for the ability to come and gather around your word this morning Lord and we just pray Lord as we invite you into the house Lord that you'll be with us today give us Liberty and understanding Lord Jesus Lord that you'll help us Lord Jesus to receive to have the right spirit in the right right attitude to receive what you have in store for us today Lord I pray Lord that you'll be with us this morning as we just study through these scriptures be with brother Tim as he's preparing his heart Lord to to deliver his message to us today Lord and we just ask Lord that you'll be with us and bless your word Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen so verse 7 says remember them which have the rule over you who have spoken unto you the word of God whose Faith follow considering the end of their conversation Jesus Christ same yesterday and today and forever and I I really just kind of wanted to meditate more on um you know we there God has given us good leadership um but then uh on the other the flip side of that you begin to study the seals and so forth and look at the history of the church down through the seven Church ages and there's that that nickan spirit that rose up that had tried to take a different kind of rule so it's I it's I think it's just kind of helpful to study that out and see that God wants us to have liberty liberty and worship Liberty and understanding and that's really what that nickan Spirit was would would that Antichrist spirit that began down in the very first church age tried to take away from the people and of course you study that out and you can see that it it it runs all the way over today where you can see that same Spirit tries to influence things there's spirits that you know move in the church and try to influence I mean even you look at how Jezebel that Jezebel spirit if you follow it all through all the way through the Jezebel spirit would try to control control the way that Elijah uh Elijah brought his message and controlled Ahab and it's all about control many times so you look at um let's look at this first little slide that we were reading uh last time where brother Ram said it is the word that rules us not men now there that really puts into perspective what Paul was trying to say when he said remember them which have the rule over you there there's leaders that God puts in the church to to uh convey the word to preach the word and then that word grabs a hold of your life and begins to shape the way that you think and the way that you do and you the word you know the word grabs a hold of you and you start dressing differently you start believing different and before you know it you're going down to be baptized different way maybe than that way that denomination taught you why because the word began to rule over you not a man but a word and brother R will say now a man as a husband is head of the woman he rules her but the church is a woman too and her ruler is the word Jesus Jesus is the word if she rejects the word and takes any other headship she is an adulteress and in the Ephesian Church age I I I've got a lot of quotes to read so we're just going to kind of go through some of these quotes this morning and just um just meditate on the things that brother R said about that n nickan Spirit he said what the church had at Pentecost is her inalienable right originally she had the pure word of God she had the power of the spirit manifested in D divers signs and wonders and Gifts of the Holy Ghost and then he keeps going on he said that original church was not organized by men it was led by the Holy Ghost it wasn't very big it was hated and despised it was oppressed it was persecuted unto death but it was true to God it stayed with the original word pattern now see there you there you can see that to be led by the Holy Ghost it it the words got to come first because what is what is the word the word is like a a the the purpose of the word is to loose the holy ghost in your life the true interpretation of the word when it's preached it causes it causes a channel to be opened up to you so that the Holy Ghost can be able to work so now in the early church if if men's ideas were preached then that kind of binds things up where the Holy Ghost can't have Liberty but if the true interpretation of the word is preached the true Revelation oh you see like for example somebody come to church church and the devil's been telling all these lies about how you can't be saved or something and the preacher starts preaching the true interpretation that it's possible that that's for you and then something begins to open up a channel begins to open up where they begin to believe and something begins to happen and and there you've got the true Liberty of the Holy go the true Liberty of worship something strikes in a believer's heart and they see something that God wanted them to see and they just begin to something happens they begin to Rejoice maybe or or maybe they don't begin to Rejoice cuz you get Liberty is what're talking about maybe they just sit there in the quiet and something begins to stir in their heart and they go home and they want something's something's awakened within them they they they want a closer walk with God so you see we're talking about Liberty and that's what that nielan Spirit would try to take away where the Holy Ghost can have Liberty in a church or in your people's life or in your life that's what we want just like in the very the very first uh Church age for the Holy Ghost to have Liberty I got these two contrasting views on the one hand you got the Holy Ghost having free reign in the church to be able to do as he wants to do now that's really what we want we want the Holy Ghost to be able to do what he wants to do at the end of the service if every maybe everybody's ready to go get something to eat but the Holy Ghost wants to do something so we we'll linger we we'll let the Holy Ghost do what he wants to do in somebody's life and and how is he going to do it when the true gospel is preached to open up some about that channel then the Holy Ghost can do what he wants to do now on the other side we've got this picture of the stained glass wind everybody's all dressed in their finery with their little flowers on their tuxed and things and it looks real religious but the Holy Ghost can't do what the Holy Ghost wants to do he can't move why because they they they've cabbaged down on on that that nickan idea where they've got a bunch of men telling you what their thoughts are and their their ideas about how things should be run and it just restricts the holy ghost from being able to do something you know they're being baptized in the name of uh three different people and don't don't have true understanding of the godhead don't have a true understanding of all these all these core doctrines that we believe and it just prevents the holy ghost from being able to be loosed in the people's lives so what what's nanism in the message Investments brother R said I read in the Bible that God told John on the aisle of patmas that the Deeds of the nicians he hated nio conquer lady to conquer the lady and put all the Holiness in some certain men now look how look how he kind of breaks down nanism n what the way it should work is Holiness is to all everybody should be able to experience a moving of the Holy Ghost in their life not just a select group of people not like a priest or a post up in up in the front you know we just grabbing it all to themselves and say and you got to listen to me he said the Holy Spirit fell upon the whole group there's no holy man anyhow it's a holy God we don't say holy church holy people is holy God we're not holy but he is Holy not a holy minister is the holy spirit he ministers through the minister is not holy men we none of us holy but they seemingly too many times are turning down the same opportunity I I love this quote from why Christ Peak now before I read this let me just set the stage where brother Brown's tell talking about Moses going down to deliver the children of Israel out of Egypt and Pharaoh says well I I'll tell you as long as the elders you the elders can go like the ministers the Bishops the the pope what you know the leaders well you can go out and worship but whatever you do don't let the people get it now there's that nickan Spirit rising up whatever you do don't let the people get a real baptism of the Holy Ghost don't let the people get don't let the Holy Ghost get to working in the people and cuz we don't the devil does not want the people sitting out there in the congregation to get a revelation of who they are and and what this Bible is telling them about so brother R said let's read it he said but you know the faith that Moses had didn't believe in a soar religion he said we're all going we're going all the way that's right we're going to the promised land we just don't go out here make it a domination and stop we go on through amen I'm going on to the promised land God promised us how many pharaohs have we got today standing in the Pulpit heads of organizations now if you just do that ju just do this and do that that's all well see just so far but Moses said oh no no no no no see Pharaoh said well why not if you're going to have that kind of religion I'll tell you what you do just you and the elders go worship see just you and the elders go worship cause you all can have that kind of of religion but don't get it among the people now you you really meditate on that maybe maybe sitting at home late tonight God wants you to catch the Revelation this is not something for just a person behind the pulpit to to have an understanding of the seals and the Deep things but God wants everybody that's why he said we're all going Mo that's what Moses commission was we're all going nobody left behind right and that other story in from 1 Samuel where all the is Elders of Israel gathered themselves together and they told they told Samuel give us a king give us a man to lead us leader it they had God leading them but instead they wanted they wanted a man to lead over them all the elders elders of Israel gathered themselves together and said unto him behold Thou Art old and thy Sons walk not in thy ways now make us a king to judge us like all the nations but the thing displeased Samuel when they said give us a king to judge us and back to the Ephesian Church age brother R said see what was happening back there that false Vine was getting a hold and it was teaching that rulership by man was right it taught that the church had to be governed it taught a control over the people but instead of doing a God's way they simply took Authority and vested all the spiritual power and their own hands and came out with a holy priesthood standing between God and the people they went right back to the old ironic system they became Antichrist for they disposed of his mediatorship and imposed their own God hated that the Ephesians hated that and any True Believer will hate it too now you see why God would hate it he wants to do something in your life and that nickolath and idea will prevent that an epes another quote from the Ephesian Church age he said we would have to be Stone blind not to see that same thing at work All Through the Ages and right now it is the worst of all what it was was organization that separated the people God's people are supposed to be one by one Spirit are they all baptized into one body and everyone is to be moved upon by the Holy Ghost and everyone is to participate and the worship of God now you see how whenever he's breaking down nanism is he's talking about Liberty and worship and the holy ghost moving in your life cuz that's what that nickan attitude wants to prevent but men wanted the preeminence so they took over control and Bishops became archbishops and with imposing titles they bypassed the word of God and taught their own doctrines they got the people to obey them until the time came that their way of worship did not in any way at all resemble the early days after Pentecost these Deeds were the beginning of apostolic succession you see you really break what what's Apostolic succession that that I can't preach unless I had been ordained or put you you know kind of put put in this position by someone who you could trace all the way back to the very fir early first CH early church and in instead of just having the liberty of God to be able to say to to to call somebody you know like like a little David or whatever to call somebody to preach so Apostolic succession is limiting the moving of the Holy Ghost to just call somebody call somebody and put them put it in a place where they can preach we're talking about Liberty the liberty of the Holy Ghost from the whole Apostolic succession it was one easy and quick step to church membership as the means of Saving Grace the word was reduced to a Creed Antichrist by his Spirit was predominating the church and this m and church age brother R said now on the second chapter in the e8th verse We Begin tonight now what did we leave him on last night he was certainly hated that nickan now what does God do what we have to have found out first the revelation of Jesus Christ who he is and what he is now the next great thing we find out that he hates anything that'll put anything to rule over his church beside besides himself he is a jealous God how I'd like to stop cuz we got four verses here just to quote a little something how many can remember when the good prophet Samuel when all of Israel wanted to act like the rest of the world do you remember that and the prophet told them said you're wrong but they wanted to act like the Philistines and like the rest of them well that's exactly what happened in this very first church age it's strange that people don't want God to lead them they want to follow they want some man now you think about that that God wants you to have a personal relationship with him where you you got that promise the spirit of truth will lead and guide you into all truth that God wants to grab a hold of your life and do the leading and questions and answers he said you know we sometimes think cuz we're preachers not you and I don't say brother but preachers think because they're preachers that there's somebody bigger than one of the L members of the church you're no bigger and you're no more in the sight of God than that drunkard that was converted an hour ago now that puts things into perspective doesn't it so what I got all these little quotes that I compiled on this slide that just pulled from different places in the message and let's just read through them nickan means to conquer the lady to take to take away that movement of the Holy Spirit on the lady and just put it on put it on the like the church leadership like they did that eventually turned into Roman Catholicism denomination it's organization where instead of following the leading of the Holy Ghost you're following what some group of people say it is terrible and now brother said now why is this such a terrible thing it is terrible because God has never placed his church in the hands of an elected leadership which moves with political mindedness he has placed his church in the care of God ordained spirit filled world living men who lead the people through feeding them the word now that goes back to what Paul's saying that we're LED we're led by the word he has not separated the people into the classes so that the masses are led by a holy priesthood it is true that the leadership must be holy but then so must the be the whole congregation further there is no place in the word where priests or ministers or such mediate between God and the people nor is there a place where they are separated in their worship of the Lord God wants all to love and serve him together nickan ISM destroys those precepts and instead separates the ministers from the people and makes the leaders overlords instead of servants that's why Peter said in 1 Peter chapter 5 feed the flock of God feed by the word neither is being Lords of God's Heritage but being examples to the flock and I got a little footnote down there that Lords mean is is it's the Greek word translated as Lord words means overbearing or controlling because the L the word the Holy Ghost is the one that we want to have control now brother Brown said in pergan church age he said now this nickan Doctrine this rule that was established in the church did not hit it off too well with a lot of the people for they could read the odd epistle or essay on the word written by some Godly person so what did the church do it excommunicated the righteous teachers and burned the Scrolls they said said it takes a special education to read and understand the word why even Peter said that many things Paul wrote were hard to understand having taken away the word from the people it soon came to the people listening only to what the priest had to say and doing what he told them they call that God and His holy word they took over their minds the minds and lives of the people and made them the Servants of a despotic priesthood what's l l n leonism following a man's ideas rather than Christ like like you can pay for your loved one to get out of purgatory that's not in the Bible anywhere that's just some man's idea but it's it's a great way to make some money a substitute for a personal relationship with God and the leading of the Holy Ghost you're substitute the leading of a man for the leading of the Holy Spirit when you you it's you're basically swapping it out nanism is that formal dead religion it's trying to take the church with where God had pastors and the spirit of God moving by gifts in the Church of the Living God and they were having a Doctrine start that they were going to have some priests and Bishops and popes and he said all right overthrow or conquer or take place of the Ley in other words take all the sacredness all the power from the church and put it over on the priests let the congregation live the way it wants to but the priest is the Holy One taking the Holy Ghost away from the people and that goes back to that story in why Christ PE whatever you do don't let the people have a real experience with God don't let the people catch a revelation taking the Holy Ghost away from the people with signs and wonders following them and take that away and give them a holy priesthood taking away the Holy Ghost and swapping it for a priesthood brother random said in another place he said the nickolath and bringing in a bunch of men to twist up the scripture and make a denomination that can't let God move in it and another place he said not one time can I ever glean one thing of all the Bishops of the nician church that formed the hierarchy of Rome the pope not one time in history have we a record of any of those Bishops ever raising the dead or anything like that because Christ the resurrection wasn't in their hearts oh you see where that nian Spirit it it's against the Holy Ghost being able to do what the Holy Ghost wants to do Liberty and worship and Truth another place he said now the word pergamus means marry the very word pergamus means uh married Christianity that is the nielan side the formal side married to the state Pagan ceremonies and it was the birth of the Catholic church in that day now anyone knows that the Catholic church was brought into existence at the Nic seeing counsel before there it was called a nickan by God which means to conquer overthrow overcome or overthrow the lady and when they did that they didn't want the spirit amongst the people that's that nickan Spirit didn't want the spirit amongst the people brother Ram said and be not afraid it is I he said I am not one of the Believers and the nicat and taking all conquer the Le and put it all on the pasture it's in the lady the Holy Spirit just doesn't baptize the pastor it baptizes the lady too it's all in the L and Pastor is just one of us means the shepherd Pastor which means the feeder of the flock the holy spirit gives overseer to watch it and control it he's not saying we don't need a pastor he's saying he wants the same Holy Ghost that's up here behind the pulpit go moving through the whole congregation in the lives of each and every individualz that's what that's what God wants and that's what that nickan Spirit tries to prevent he said in the peran church age can't you see the nicians the hybrids see it don't you see the true spiritual what was the difference of them one had signs following the other one had the form the other one had signs following think about that that's what God wants to happen he wants to be able to do something in your life he wants good things to happen in your life when you need healing when you need a touch from God when you need something happen at your workplace just trust in God and let that Holy Ghost go to work he said that's the same thing that taking place here the Ning Council nickan formal Christianity and the Holy Spirit comes back and said you've got the doctrine of balum among you see I hate them doctrines them these of the nicians them doctrines that they got because it's the doctrine of balam who taught the children of Israel to stumble and we'll I'll just read this last slide and then we'll close the this we'll end the lesson he said you hybrid with the world with the nickan idea not let the Holy Ghost have its way that's the Nic it's an idea to not let the Holy Ghost have its way the word niik the Greek word niik means to overcome or conquer overcome what the leoty the Holy Spirit take out of the church the resurrected Lord Jesus with signs and wonders among the Believers and put men voted in to be a pope or a cardinal or an overseer trying to take the place to take the Holy Ghost away from the lady and give it to an order called The Holy order of men you say why can't the priest be a Shepherd what kind of a food is he feeding you do you get the same results they had the day of Pentecost and he said now you just can't have a nician setup in the church and not have this other Doctrine bism come into to you you see if you take away the word of God and the moving of the spirit as a means of worship then you will have to give the people another form of worship as a substitute and substitution spells bism so what what's God want to do he wants to have his way with you let's let him have his way with us today during this service just if you haven't yet give him give him your heart give him everything you are so that the Holy Ghost can have its way amen and do what he wants to do with you God bless you [Applause] Saints
