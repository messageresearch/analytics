[0:08] all right good morning
[0:16] everyone
[0:18] um boy the devil's been giving us a run
[0:21] for it this morning
[0:24] amen um let's go ahead and turn to
[0:27] Matthew chap 5 we''ve been reading
[0:30] all
[0:45] right Matthew chapter
[0:58] five
[1:07] so last time we we got to U we had
[1:11] finished about half of hunger and
[1:13] thirsting for righteousness and then I
[1:14] went back to meekness cuz meekness is
[1:19] um let's just kind of give let's let's
[1:21] read through these real quick just to
[1:24] refresh our memory
[1:27] we Matthew 5 verse1 seeing the
[1:30] multitudes he went up into a mountain
[1:32] and when he was set his disciples came
[1:34] unto him and he opened his mouth and
[1:36] taught them saying blessed are the poor
[1:39] in spirit for theirs is the Kingdom of
[1:42] Heaven realizing that your righteousness
[1:46] is is filthy rag like Isaiah said
[1:49] blessed are they that mourn for they
[1:50] shall be comforted if you mourn for your
[1:53] condition and desire to se God's word
[1:55] fulfilled in your life then God will
[1:57] give you the comforter and comfort you
[2:00] blessed are the meek for they shall
[2:02] inherit the
[2:03] earth real meekness I believe is when
[2:06] you can pick up the message and and say
[2:09] this this man knows what he's talking
[2:11] about this is these are the words this
[2:13] is the word of life we same thing when
[2:16] you pick up the Bible and you don't
[2:18] argue over the scripture anymore but it
[2:19] becomes real to you blessed are they
[2:22] which do hunger and thirst after
[2:24] righteousness for they shall be filled
[2:26] and that's what we're going to talk
[2:28] about today
[2:30] so we summarize all these we want to
[2:32] find out last time we kind of talked
[2:35] about what hungering and thirsting
[2:37] is and now we're going to kind of get
[2:41] into what righteousness is and I'm going
[2:44] to go ahead and Skip ahead and tell you
[2:45] the whole lesson that righteousness is
[2:47] his word and be we hungering and if you
[2:51] hunger and thirst to see God's word made
[2:54] manifest in your life and there's a
[2:56] promise that it will be fulfilled you
[2:58] can stretch that word fill out to
[3:01] fulfill that his word will be fulfilled
[3:03] in your life all the promises that were
[3:06] spoken through scripture uh that's
[3:09] that's what we're here for it uh there's
[3:11] so many people in the in the in the
[3:14] world today that don't really understand
[3:16] what their purpose in life is and kind
[3:18] of go through life um Meandering not
[3:21] knowing where they're where they're
[3:23] going or where they're coming from and
[3:25] but we're so blessed to be able to
[3:28] um to know what our purpose in life is
[3:31] and where we're
[3:34] going so what is righteousness we looked
[3:36] at this slide last time um in the Old
[3:39] Testament the word c rightwise in mtis
[3:42] said one this is his interpretation of
[3:45] right just U mtis was a um he's kind of
[3:49] a regarded as a famous Jewish scholar
[3:53] that the Jews highly regard what he has
[3:55] to say and he said one whose Merit
[3:57] surpasses his iniquity is a sodic and
[4:00] tend to um kind of coin the word
[4:02] righteousness and use it in the New
[4:04] Testament to translate um holy people
[4:07] holy conformed to the will of
[4:09] God and there's only righteousness is
[4:12] the only thing that uh that is
[4:14] acceptable to God and God looks at us
[4:16] think like a mirror he's got to look at
[4:18] us and see himself reflected back the
[4:21] only thing that will be right is God's
[4:24] is God's word fulfilled in
[4:27] us so I just put a few scriptures
[4:30] down what is righteousness let's kind of
[4:34] take a little bit just to slowly go
[4:36] through these in Matthew
[4:39] 5:20 Jesus said for I say unto you that
[4:43] except your
[4:44] righteousness shall exceed the
[4:46] righteousness of the scribes and
[4:47] Pharisees you shall in no case enter
[4:51] into the kingdom of
[4:54] heaven now the scribes and Pharisees
[4:57] obeyed the the law but what God's
[5:00] requirement is is to see his word made
[5:03] manifest in you right acts 10:34 35 then
[5:08] Peter opened his mouth and said of of a
[5:11] truth I perceive that God is no
[5:13] respector of
[5:14] persons but in every nation he that
[5:16] fearth him and worketh righteousness is
[5:21] accepted with
[5:23] him in Romans
[5:25] 1:17 for therein is the righteousness of
[5:28] God revealed from Faith to Faith as it
[5:32] is written just shall live by faith we
[5:35] know that faith is a revelation just
[5:37] like down Through the Ages from from the
[5:41] Revelation that Luther had that the just
[5:43] shall live by faith to the Revelation
[5:45] that John Wesley had that our lives must
[5:48] be holy and cleansed now we've come to
[5:51] from Faith to Faith that God's word in
[5:55] this day can be completely um to is
[5:58] totally un unveil and we can have a
[6:00] complete understanding from the
[6:01] beginning from Genesis to Revelation
[6:04] that and then what's the ultimate goal
[6:07] of is not just to say I know all these
[6:10] secrets but it's to have your life
[6:12] changeed that's where I'm getting to is
[6:14] to is it it's not just speaking words
[6:17] but it's to have God's life in you
[6:22] revealed if it doesn't change our life
[6:25] then that's the goal in 1 John 3:10 and
[6:29] this is the children of God are manifest
[6:31] and the children of the devil whosoever
[6:34] doeth not righteousness is not of God
[6:37] neither he that loveth not his brother
[6:39] it's the life life behind the name is
[6:42] what makes the demons
[6:44] tremble so let's look at Romans chapter
[6:58] 10
[7:13] let's start at verse
[7:17] one Brethren my heart's desire and
[7:20] prayer to God for Israel is that they
[7:23] might be
[7:25] saved for I bear them record that they
[7:27] have a Zeal of God but not according to
[7:29] in knowledge mhm for they being ignorant
[7:32] of God's righteousness and going about
[7:35] to establish their own righteousness
[7:37] have not submitted unto the
[7:39] righteousness of God for Christ is the
[7:42] end of the law for righteousness to
[7:44] everyone that believeth for Moses
[7:47] describeth the righteousness which is of
[7:48] the law that the man which doeth those
[7:50] things shall live by them but the
[7:53] righteousness which is of faith speaketh
[7:55] on this wise say not in thine heart who
[7:58] shall Ascend into heaven that that is to
[7:59] bring Christ down from above or who
[8:02] shall descend into the deep that is to
[8:04] bring up Christ again from the dead what
[8:07] sayith that the word is n the even in
[8:09] thy mouth and in thy heart that is the
[8:11] word of faith which be preached that if
[8:14] Thou shalt confess with thy mouth the
[8:16] Lord Jesus and Shall Believe in thine
[8:18] heart that God hath raised him from the
[8:20] dead Thou shalt be saved for with a
[8:23] heart man believeth unto righteousness
[8:25] and with a mouth confession is made unto
[8:28] salvation
[8:29] so if the only thing that's acceptable
[8:32] to God is himself revealed in you his
[8:35] word and and uh you must confess it is
[8:39] it interesting that you've got to
[8:40] confess it and you know the the word
[8:43] that this the term the word is maybe one
[8:45] of the most difficult to um Concepts to
[8:50] maybe
[8:50] explain but it's interesting that you
[8:53] got to confess it because the word is
[8:56] the manifestation of what's inside of
[8:59] you when you have whatever is inside is
[9:01] sooner or later going to come out when
[9:04] you say when you say I I believe what
[9:07] the prophet said butt when you put a
[9:09] little butt on it it shows there's
[9:11] something something missing on the
[9:12] inside it's not in in lining up with
[9:15] God's
[9:17] word think about the word is if if I'm
[9:20] thinking something in my mind there's no
[9:23] way for you to to have
[9:26] uh there's no way for you to know what's
[9:29] inside of my heart until I speak it
[9:32] that's what the word is it's the
[9:33] manifestation of God's attributes the
[9:36] the uh God manifest manifesting
[9:41] himself so let's
[9:46] um I have a just a quote here the sudden
[9:50] secret going away of the church brother
[9:53] ROM said and each night the conversation
[9:55] would be that going to Vamp this young
[9:56] man and marry and who would then they
[9:58] would own the r themselves for the sun
[10:00] would fall air to fall so they made
[10:03] themselves ready so you see there's a
[10:04] ready to be made you make yourself ready
[10:06] by joining church or something that
[10:09] ain't all that's required you got to
[10:10] have oil in your lamp see just you're
[10:12] dressing saying we'll build a big church
[10:14] we belong to a better denomination we'll
[10:16] give them a pip org to the Lord we'll
[10:18] make plush seats that isn't what God
[10:21] requires righteousness is what God
[10:23] requires of his son Christ Jesus that's
[10:26] the garments for the Bible said the
[10:27] white clothes she is adorned in is the
[10:30] righteousness of the
[10:33] Saints now let's look at Matthew 3 this
[10:37] is a beautiful
[10:55] story now I want to read um from verse
[11:03] um let's let's start at verse one cuz I
[11:07] want to kind
[11:08] of point out that John knew who he was
[11:11] and what he was there for in those days
[11:13] Came John the Baptist preaching in the
[11:15] wilderness of Judea and saying repent ye
[11:17] for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand for
[11:18] this is he that was spoken of by the
[11:20] prophet Isaiah saying the voice of one
[11:22] crying in the wilderness prepare you the
[11:23] way of the Lord make his path straight
[11:25] and the same John had his rment of
[11:27] camel's hair and a Lea G about his loins
[11:29] and his meat was Locust and wild honey
[11:31] then went out to to him Jerusalem and
[11:33] all Judea and all the region round about
[11:35] Jordan and were baptized with him in
[11:37] Jordan confessing their sins but when he
[11:39] saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees
[11:41] come to his baptism he said unto them oh
[11:43] generation of viers who warn you flee
[11:45] from the Wrath to come bring forth
[11:47] therefore fruits meat for repentance and
[11:49] think not to say within yourselves we
[11:51] have Abraham to Our Father for I say
[11:53] unto you that God is able of these
[11:55] stones to raise up children of Abraham
[11:57] and now also the ACT is laid under the
[11:59] root of the trees therefore every tree
[12:01] which bringeth not forth good fruit is
[12:03] HED down and cast into the fire I indeed
[12:06] baptize you with water under repentance
[12:07] but he that cometh after me is mightier
[12:10] than I whose shoes I am not worthy to
[12:12] Bear he shall baptize you with the Holy
[12:14] Ghost into the fire so John knew what he
[12:16] was doing there and he knew what the one
[12:18] that was coming after him was going to
[12:19] do he knew he was there to introduce the
[12:22] Messiah that he was coming whose fan is
[12:25] in his hand and he will thoroughly purch
[12:27] his FL and gather his weed into the GN
[12:29] but he will burn up the chaff with
[12:30] unquenchable fire then cometh Jesus From
[12:33] Galilee to Jordan un John to be baptized
[12:35] with him but John forbade him saying I
[12:37] have need to be baptized of thee and
[12:40] comest thou to me and Jesus answering
[12:42] said unto him suffer it to be so now for
[12:44] thus it becometh us to fulfill all
[12:46] righteousness then he suffered him and
[12:49] we read last time in Exodus how why
[12:51] Jesus had to be baptized to um to
[12:55] fulfill all the word that was spoken of
[12:57] him and this speaks of the the bride
[13:00] today we're supposed to know exactly
[13:02] what we're here for we're supposed to
[13:04] we're supposed to be a reflection of
[13:06] God's word God all the all of the
[13:09] scripture in the whole Bible that that
[13:11] speak leading up to this day we're
[13:13] supposed to um eat it up take it in fill
[13:17] it out fulfill every word until the last
[13:21] scripture the the last promise that
[13:23] we'll take a body change just will Fu
[13:27] us um
[13:29] and
[13:32] uh keep what is righteousness and it
[13:36] becometh us to fulfill all righteousness
[13:37] brother man said um let's see where I
[13:41] want to
[13:43] start let's start right here you know
[13:45] who I am because God and L has told you
[13:47] to be a sign call me and you've already
[13:48] bore witness of it and you know it we
[13:50] know who each other are we know each
[13:52] other and it's true that you need to be
[13:54] baptized in me but let's suffer that to
[13:56] be so for John if we are the lights of
[13:57] this day we must fulfill fill all
[13:59] righteousness all God's word must be
[14:01] fulfilled by us for this day for it is
[14:03] becoming to us behing is becoming as
[14:05] like us for if we are the true Witnesses
[14:07] of God today we are the liks of this age
[14:09] and if we are the liks of this age there
[14:10] some of the scripture that's got to be
[14:12] fulfilled during this age and it's up to
[14:13] us it's up to us to see that God all
[14:16] God's righteousness is is fulfilled and
[14:19] what is his righteousness his word right
[14:22] and it becometh us to fulfill all
[14:24] righteousness he said um God wants men
[14:28] and women who will stand and fulfill all
[14:30] righteousness of course righteousness is
[14:32] his
[14:34] word it becometh us to fulfill all
[14:36] rightous 61 it said the words all the
[14:39] words got to be fulfilled the last
[14:41] paragraph the line of every age should
[14:43] do the same thing we know what's to be
[14:45] fulfilled you who are spiritual and know
[14:47] the word of God you see what God has
[14:49] promised now the word will not come just
[14:51] easy but it comes by observation you got
[14:54] to press your way in do it but yet it
[14:56] beh behoveth us it is is becoming for to
[14:59] us to fulfill all God's righteousness we
[15:02] must do
[15:05] it so blessed are they which do hunger
[15:08] and thirst after seeing God's word
[15:11] fulfilled in our life for they shall be
[15:13] filled it's a promise that you'll get
[15:15] the Holy Ghost and after you get the
[15:16] Holy Ghost it's a promise that moving on
[15:18] up to stature of the perfect man moving
[15:20] through God's promises every promise in
[15:22] the Bible will be fulfilled if you look
[15:24] at any it's a promise that unlike Eve
[15:28] and the in Genesis who couldn't take all
[15:30] of God's word there's going to be
[15:32] somebody in this day that will take
[15:34] every every scripture and say I believe
[15:36] it and make it manifest in their
[15:41] life every every promise of God in the
[15:44] Bible we can say Amen to that's why it's
[15:48] it's confession is so much a part of it
[15:51] because you can't if you believe it out
[15:53] of your mouth will come the confession
[15:55] that that is what's in my heart to
[15:58] manifest what's what's
[16:01] inside what is the word let's look at
[16:05] Matthew
[16:23] 26 now my point here is a lot of times
[16:27] we um
[16:31] the the word being made manifest is
[16:33] God's life in you God's life being
[16:36] revealed in you a lot of times we kind
[16:38] of get off of that a little bit and
[16:39] think that U God's the be the word being
[16:42] revealed in you is be able to um uh say
[16:46] what other people expect you to say or
[16:49] um just be able to um
[16:52] uh pray long prayers or or uh do things
[16:57] that uh well let's maybe it'll be clear
[17:00] once we read this cuz I think this
[17:04] shows this is just this is really
[17:08] amazing Matthew 2631 through
[17:12] 35 then saith Jesus unto
[17:15] them after the the the Passover they
[17:19] taken the Lord's supper and sayth Jesus
[17:21] unto them all ye shall be offended
[17:23] because of me this night for it is
[17:26] written I will Smite the shepher and and
[17:28] the sheep or the flock shall be
[17:30] scattered abroad he's prophesying what's
[17:33] about to happen he's going to die to die
[17:35] for our sins and the disciples will um
[17:40] not having yet the baptism of the Holy
[17:43] Ghost that going to be scattered abroad
[17:45] wondering what has happened not sure
[17:48] what's what's taking place but after I
[17:51] am risen again I will go before you into
[17:54] Galilee and Peter answered and said unto
[17:56] him what seemed to be what what would
[17:58] seem to be uh righteous testimony what
[18:02] would seem to be acceptable to anybody
[18:04] that would listen what that was over
[18:07] here in this
[18:08] conversation Peter answered and said
[18:10] unto him although all men should be
[18:12] offended of thee yet will I never be
[18:15] offended and it sounded good but it was
[18:18] just the word is not just words it's the
[18:21] life in you revealed and in this case
[18:24] Peter just had he didn't have the word
[18:27] in his life back in up the words that he
[18:29] said so that's that's my point is the um
[18:34] it's not enough just to be able to to
[18:37] repeat after someone to say the same
[18:39] thing that they did but you got to have
[18:41] the word made manifest in your life
[18:44] that's what righteousness is is not just
[18:46] saying repeating what the Bible said
[18:48] repeating what somebody else said or
[18:50] doing something because you think that
[18:53] would be acceptable to man or to man's
[18:56] ears Jesus said unto them
[18:58] the next
[19:00] verse well let's go back read that again
[19:02] Peter answered and said unto him though
[19:04] all men shall be offended because of
[19:06] thee yet will I never be offended Jesus
[19:10] said unto him verily I say unto thee
[19:13] that this night before the crew
[19:15] Thou shalt deny me
[19:17] Thrice Peter said unto him now now Jesus
[19:20] was the word made manifest all of the
[19:23] scriptures what he was fulfilling
[19:25] everything that was in the mind of God
[19:27] all of the the love everything was made
[19:30] manifest right there before him and the
[19:33] word had just spoken verely I say unto
[19:37] thee that this night before the cre
[19:38] Thou shalt deny me thri and right after
[19:41] that Peter said unto him though I should
[19:43] die with thee yet will I not deny thee
[19:47] likewise also said all the disciples it
[19:50] wasn't just Peter it was all the
[19:53] disciples they all made a confession
[19:55] that that their what was inside of them
[19:58] couldn't back up
[20:00] right so now let's
[20:03] do I I have it on the screen so you
[20:05] don't have to turn there Luke 52123 and
[20:08] this is when Jesus was preaching in the
[20:10] synagogue and they had lowered the man
[20:12] down into be that was sick and lame they
[20:14] lowered him down so that Jesus could
[20:17] pray for him and he he told the man I
[20:19] for all your sins are forgiven and the
[20:21] scribes and Pharisees began to say who
[20:23] can forgive sins but God Luke 5: 21:23
[20:26] and the scribes and the Pharisees began
[20:28] to reason saying who is this which
[20:31] speaketh blasphemies who can forgive
[20:33] sins but God Alone Now Jesus says you
[20:37] think that's amazing let me let me show
[20:39] you something a little bit greater when
[20:41] Jesus perceived their thoughts he
[20:42] answered and said unto them what reason
[20:44] ye in your hearts whether is easier to
[20:46] say thy sins be forgiven thee which
[20:49] according to the scribes and Pharisees
[20:51] by their own mouth only God can forgive
[20:54] sins he said which is easier thy sins be
[20:56] forgiven thee or the say rise up and
[20:59] walk y cuz if you can say rise up and
[21:02] walk it's only God being made manifest
[21:05] that can do that so now let's turn to
[21:09] acts
[21:21] three and I've got a picture of what the
[21:25] gate beautiful look
[21:27] like as you go into the inner Court of
[21:30] the
[21:31] temple now before Peter only had he was
[21:35] just repeating what he thought would
[21:37] sound good he just he couldn't back it
[21:40] up with his life but now after the day
[21:42] of
[21:42] Pentecost acts 3:1 now Peter and John
[21:45] went up together into the temple at The
[21:47] Hour of Prayer being the ninth hour and
[21:51] a certain man lay from his mother's womb
[21:53] was carried whom they laid daily at the
[21:55] Gate of the temple which is called
[21:57] Beautiful and laid him right there
[21:59] because that's where all of the people
[22:01] that should be having fellowship with
[22:03] God were going in they should have had
[22:07] they should have like expecting all of
[22:10] the people that went up this gate to
[22:12] have to
[22:16] uh to have a relationship with God and
[22:20] then came two people that really did
[22:22] have a relationship with God a certain
[22:25] man lay from his mother's wom was
[22:26] carried whom they laid down at the Gate
[22:28] of the temple which is called Beautiful
[22:30] to ask arms of them that entered into
[22:32] the temple who seeing Peter and John
[22:34] about to go into the temple ask the arms
[22:36] and Peter fastening his eyes upon him
[22:38] with John said look on us and he gave
[22:41] heed unto them expecting to receive
[22:43] something of them then Peter said Silver
[22:46] and Gold Have I None but such as I have
[22:48] give I Thee and the name of Jesus Christ
[22:51] of Nazareth rise up and walk so nobody
[22:55] can say rise up and walk except God
[22:58] being made manifest in you that's my
[23:00] point the life of God being made
[23:03] manifest in you is what righteousness is
[23:07] hungering and thirsty this is a Psalm
[23:09] that David wrote A Psalm of David when
[23:10] he was in the wilderness of Judah oh
[23:13] God Thou Art my God early will I seek
[23:16] thee my soul thirsteth for thee my flesh
[23:18] longth for thee in a dry and thirsty
[23:21] land where no water is to see what's he
[23:24] longing for so that he can have a lot of
[23:27] words to to impress people to
[23:30] um but but it's not just vain words but
[23:34] it's the life made manifest in you to
[23:36] see thy power and thy Glory so as I have
[23:39] seen thee in the sanctuary because thy
[23:42] loving kindness is better than life my
[23:44] lips shall pray thee 1 Corinthians 23:5
[23:49] and I was with you in weakness and in
[23:50] fear and in much trembling in my speech
[23:52] and my preaching was not with enticing
[23:54] words of man's Wisdom but in
[23:56] demonstration of his spirit and of power
[23:59] that your faith should not stand in the
[24:00] wisdom of men but in the power of God
[24:03] and what's the power of God power the
[24:05] power well let's read John 1:11 he came
[24:09] unto his own and his own received him
[24:11] not but as many as received unto them
[24:13] gave you power to become the sons of God
[24:16] even to them that believe on his name
[24:18] and this power to live a Christian Life
[24:21] is is such a it's so much greater than
[24:25] any word you could say remember that the
[24:27] test testimony that brother Brandon told
[24:29] of the little lady that um her husband
[24:31] was drunk and uh she they they were
[24:35] making fun of her and everything and
[24:37] they went out and just heard her in in
[24:39] there sweeping the floor and
[24:41] saying that singing that song uh must
[24:44] Jesus bear the cross
[24:45] alone and she didn't say one word but
[24:48] her life was a greater testimony than
[24:51] all of the all of the sermons all of the
[24:53] uh expounding scripture saying let me
[24:56] tell you how much I know her life was
[24:58] what brought them to the Lord and I uh
[25:00] when we were at uh brother Tim hes
[25:02] church last um Sunday George Smith was
[25:05] kind of telling how he came into the
[25:07] message a little bit and it I found it
[25:10] striking that he said more than all the
[25:14] signs and wonders and everything what
[25:16] really pulled him to the message was
[25:18] looking at brother Brandon's life how he
[25:20] didn't have some a bunch of slaves
[25:23] washing his car or just how he treated
[25:25] his wife and how he treated his family
[25:28] and how he treated the people in his
[25:30] church that's the life that is the
[25:32] righteousness of God made manifest and
[25:35] the only way that you can have you can
[25:39] you can Manu try to manufacture
[25:41] something like Peter did saying
[25:43] something that his word couldn't back up
[25:45] when the word is made manifest in you it
[25:47] won't be made manufactured anymore the
[25:50] word is life there's a man here that can
[25:53] turn on the light
[25:54] 1963 just think the old husk of
[25:56] yesterday see don't point PL it back
[25:58] there it's rotten it cannot cannot stay
[26:00] with it no sir it will not do no good it
[26:02] won't grow it's off of the life and the
[26:05] word is the life that's
[26:09] right the word expressed in the Ephesian
[26:12] Church age he said God's intention for
[26:14] his creation man is to express his words
[26:17] in Genesis Adam was given the word to
[26:19] live by life live by the word would be
[26:23] the word
[26:24] expressed and down at the bottom and on
[26:26] the tree he received the wounds andto
[26:28] death that we by him and because of him
[26:32] might eat of the tree of life and in
[26:34] that life freely given would enable us
[26:37] to overcome and express the word of God
[26:41] Amen and uh I just just as a little
[26:45] exercise I just compiled a little short
[26:48] list of the scriptures that uh the
[26:51] promises of God to fulfill all
[26:53] righteousness let's just real quick go
[26:55] through some of these Psalms 10312 let's
[26:57] as far as the East is from the West so
[27:01] far have he removed our transgressions
[27:03] from us and all these promises that in
[27:05] this day we're fulfilling 1 John 1:9 if
[27:09] we confess our sins he is faithful and
[27:11] just to forgive us our sins and to
[27:14] cleanse us from all unrighteousness acts
[27:16] 2:39 for the promises unto you and to
[27:19] your children and to all that are far
[27:20] off even as many as the Lord Our God
[27:22] shall call as we read I'm reading
[27:24] through
[27:26] this we can say Amen to every one of
[27:29] these words if you read any of these
[27:31] scriptures and say yeah but the promises
[27:33] unto you and your children but maybe not
[27:36] mine something inside needs to be
[27:39] protected Philippians 46:7 be careful
[27:42] for nothing but in everything by prayer
[27:43] and supplication with Thanksgiving let
[27:46] your request be made known unto God and
[27:48] the peace of God which pass passeth all
[27:51] understanding shall keep your hearts and
[27:53] Minds through Christ Jesus that's the
[27:55] promise of the Peace of God Malachi 3:10
[27:59] bring ye all the ties in the storehouse
[28:01] that there might be meat there may be
[28:03] meat in mine house and prove me now
[28:05] there with sayith the Lord of hosts the
[28:06] I will not open you the windows of
[28:07] heaven and pour you out of blessing that
[28:09] there shall not be room enough to
[28:10] receive it 1 John 5:4 to5 for whatsoever
[28:14] is born of God overcometh the world and
[28:17] this is the victory that overcometh the
[28:19] world even our faith who is he that
[28:21] overcometh the world but he that
[28:23] believeth that Jesus is the son of God
[28:25] James 478 submit yourself therefore to
[28:28] God resist the devil and he will flee
[28:29] from you draw nigh to God and He will
[28:32] draw nigh to you cleanse your hands you
[28:34] Sinners and purify your heart ye double
[28:36] minded 1 Corinthians 15:53 54 for this
[28:40] corruptible must put on incorruption mhm
[28:43] and this Mortal must put on
[28:46] immortality so when this corruptible
[28:48] shall had put on incorruption and this
[28:51] Mortal shall have put on
[28:53] immortality then shall be brought to
[28:55] pass the saying that is written
[28:58] death is swallowed up in Victory and
[29:01] that's what I'm looking
[29:03] for all right let's
[29:05] stop
[29:09] amen
