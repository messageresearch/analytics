[0:00] more let's turn back to disa for 30 15
[0:15] and the lower said unto Him will
[0:18] therefore whosoever slayeth Cain vinna
[0:20] shall be taking on him Sevenfold and the
[0:23] Lord said a mark upon pain like day
[0:25] fighting him to killing the last time we
[0:28] kind of flicked it a col this in the
[0:31] time how the neighbor deal with the
[0:34] unbeliever you're not supposed to take
[0:36] vengeance Phoenix is minus a 0 over and
[0:41] we were looking at the different
[0:43] scriptures down through the Bible to
[0:45] talk about how when someone crosses the
[0:48] line that it's time to just leave them
[0:50] alone you don't try to take videos like
[0:58] a lot of people get upset at what so
[1:00] much preaching to put up a website to
[1:03] destroy that person's good reputation or
[1:05] things like that that's what I'm getting
[1:07] it well then we'll look at oh but we
[1:14] stopped it dan and Ephraim we were
[1:17] talking about how is a yeah I said it
[1:19] went when they from join themselves to
[1:22] Isles got in the scripture it
[1:26] excessively promote they've joined
[1:27] himself to I don't believe all and then
[1:30] when I was going to next talk about this
[1:33] story of Polycarp for the First Church
[1:35] of Rome now the first church in Rome
[1:40] after that a lot of people don't really
[1:43] know how feeling is one
[1:46] don't really know where Andronicus and
[1:49] Junia came from how they heard about the
[1:51] gospel they speculate that they were one
[1:53] of the at the day of Pentecost when
[1:56] Peter delivered his message in the
[1:58] street after they were filled with the
[2:00] Holy Ghost power came down and here
[2:03] deliver just great sermon and told the
[2:07] keys to the kingdom repent be baptized
[2:11] in the name of Lord Jesus Christ and you
[2:15] can have the promise and many people
[2:18] believe that andronica Andronicus and
[2:20] Junia were a part of that congregation
[2:23] because there were people from all
[2:24] around all around the world there
[2:27] because they heard them in their
[2:29] different tongues and so at any rate
[2:33] Andronicus and Junia took the gospel to
[2:37] Rome because when in when Priscilla and
[2:43] Aquila travel to Rome to set up they
[2:47] wanted to set up a church they found
[2:49] that I'm darkest and Ginny and we're
[2:50] already there in Roma 67th Paul said it
[2:54] and drunken singh ji geum were before
[2:57] him in christ so they they heard about
[2:58] the gospel for paul did so the Roman
[3:03] Church was filled with mix there was a
[3:06] lot of a lot of people that came out of
[3:08] the Robin Roman paganism they're rolling
[3:10] because they you know that just because
[3:13] of the geographic location there were a
[3:15] lot of people that weren't Jews there
[3:16] they didn't know didn't have a solid
[3:19] background of the Jewish faith of the
[3:22] Old Testament Scriptures so when
[3:24] 4-cylinder cool i came to roman and they
[3:27] started helping geniune Andronicus to
[3:30] minister to the people there in Rome and
[3:32] teach them the old testament scriptures
[3:35] and held him to come grounded in it and
[3:38] the orthodox jews that were there they
[3:41] were very angry at when people would
[3:47] leave their ranks and become christians
[3:49] they would they would just do about
[3:52] anything to make moral and little church
[3:54] and through lots of little political
[4:00] intrigues and different things the
[4:02] Emperor Claudius decided that he was
[4:04] going to expel all the Jews from wrong
[4:06] and this is why we know that Peter was
[4:08] never in Rome because Claudius expel all
[4:10] the Jews from wrong during the time that
[4:12] he would have been there oh so Aquila
[4:20] and Priscilla would use Andronicus NGE
[4:22] or not Jonathan said you were thrown in
[4:25] prison and Aquila and Priscilla were
[4:28] left were kicked out of Rome so that
[4:32] left the little woman church without its
[4:35] background that's solid teachers to
[4:37] teach them the word from the Old
[4:39] Testament Scriptures oh so they began to
[4:43] go back in to bring ends their little
[4:47] Roman paganism ideas and different
[4:49] things from the from their history they
[4:55] started they what they did was a electic
[4:58] Andronicus was a leader of the church
[5:00] the pastor so when he left they elected
[5:04] someone needed to take his place and
[5:07] they called him a father and you know
[5:10] jesus said call no man father because
[5:12] you're not begotten of any man you
[5:14] begotten of God God as our Father you
[5:17] don't enter the kingdom of heaven
[5:18] because anyone but God it gives you the
[5:21] birth and so when they were when the
[5:24] four apostles finally were able to
[5:26] return to the to the church in Rome they
[5:29] were rejected and how to start a new
[5:31] journey the second second church in Rome
[5:34] oh so then facts for many years later to
[5:39] the Smyrna an age when Polycarp heard
[5:42] about how the first church in Rome was
[5:45] taking all these paganistic beliefs and
[5:47] had back slid he heard about the
[5:50] Passover changes and even though at this
[5:54] point he was under 90 years old he
[5:57] decided he's going to go talk to the new
[5:58] leader that was his name was Anna Cetus
[6:01] and this is all
[6:05] this is all found in a little book
[6:07] called how did it happen that I can't
[6:10] find it anywhere else besides it comes
[6:12] with the table if you get it from the
[6:14] war cigar that's all I play like a phone
[6:17] but it's just full of wonderful things
[6:20] about how the early church started and
[6:22] what happened after yeah so when
[6:36] Polycarp got to roll he you know he
[6:41] ministered and healed the sick and
[6:46] demons were cast out and many people
[6:49] heard about the things that girls doing
[6:52] Polycarp and so he went he heard of the
[6:56] listed here are at first hand of all the
[6:58] different things that were happening in
[6:59] Nancy's his church how they had started
[7:01] worship of the Sun how they faced easter
[7:04] parade which was a symbol of their old
[7:06] Roman pagan st they would face east to
[7:10] pray to their gods and they started they
[7:15] would serve the Eucharist but um they
[7:20] would keep the wine from the people and
[7:22] you know now even the demon in the
[7:24] Western Catholic Church date they do
[7:26] that today so I could grant but not the
[7:27] one and that's remember in jeremiah
[7:32] jeremiah there was a scripture I'm guy
[7:35] that wrote themselves who worked out
[7:37] here in the stack of my news but uh he
[7:40] talked about how the children the
[7:42] children gather wood the father's killed
[7:43] fire to make queen case to the queen of
[7:46] heaven and they pour out drinks as a
[7:49] libation and even back then he was
[7:52] testifying of what what I it just the
[7:56] same spirit just follows through all the
[7:58] way from back then when Jeremiah was
[7:59] prophesied to Tapani cars dead
[8:02] how do i doing the exact same thing
[8:04] they're given the little round wafer but
[8:07] holding back then the whiner sao paulo
[8:15] car beside he was going to have a
[8:16] conversation with a seat us and you find
[8:29] it
[8:32] sao paulo car went to the service he
[8:34] said on he said up there were being a
[8:37] seat us and after the service was over
[8:38] he said he talked to try to convince
[8:43] casitas of his hair of his ways and had
[8:47] a seat assess responses was we are too
[8:50] far going to turn back so God is really
[8:55] God's bubby words to buy a car and this
[8:58] is written by irina sand and if you look
[9:00] at him and I see him father I already
[9:03] heard this down may God's puppies worked
[9:05] probably caught my friend was married to
[9:07] his I all the land below so you just
[9:11] left them alone so we looked at we've
[9:19] looked at this Cain and Abel
[9:20] relationship from one perspective to
[9:23] leave them alone and not take vengeance
[9:28] so now let's turn and look it from
[9:31] another perspective which is you know
[9:34] down through delta through the Old
[9:36] Testament there's been a lot of when
[9:43] when CNN is a picture they there's been
[9:48] a lot of death justice so let's go it's
[9:53] difficult to reconcile to Cain was not
[9:55] killed and why were all the people down
[9:59] through history that blaming little
[10:01] limited children all of all that so um
[10:07] what I wanted to do was kind of run
[10:12] through the Old Testament Scriptures
[10:13] from the from Genesis all the way up to
[10:16] the time of Christ has a high level
[10:19] overview of all the
[10:22] justice capital punishment violence in
[10:24] the scripture and see where that takes
[10:26] us home so and keep in mind that the
[10:32] story of Cain and Abel is a type of how
[10:35] we relate to a believer when they turn
[10:37] down the message because Cain was
[10:42] turning down the message of Christ for
[10:44] his day and you don't take Venus but now
[10:48] that doesn't mean that we throw our
[10:50] owners around sin and embrace it when
[10:52] senators your family or your life then
[10:55] you take out a sort of the word that's
[10:56] late and so that's what where I'm going
[11:00] so let's turn to justice 138 and also
[11:18] burn to Genesis 9 just keep your finger
[11:22] on they're going to flip back for
[11:32] so everybody's familiar with just this
[11:35] one to a 6.7 2128 says and God blessed
[11:39] them and God said unto them be fruitful
[11:42] and multiply and replenish the earth and
[11:44] subdue it and have dominion of an
[11:47] efficiency and I'm going to file the air
[11:49] and over every living thing that moveth
[11:50] upon the earth and Genesis 9 12 God's
[11:56] yachts changing the dispensation and God
[12:00] bless know any sense I said and then be
[12:02] fruitful and multiply and replace their
[12:05] the first multiplication it's a
[12:07] spiritual multiplication annex is now
[12:09] our sex of the end of the picture and
[12:11] where reproduction is made by natural
[12:14] reproduction justice 92 and the fear of
[12:18] you and the dread of you shall be upon
[12:20] every pitch to the earth and a point
[12:22] every fouled the air Paul that moveth
[12:24] upon the earth and applause official of
[12:26] the sea into your hand are they deliver
[12:29] 120 80 puts man the over dominion over
[12:31] the fish to see and now the dread every
[12:34] animal is a poem the rid of you shall be
[12:39] home every beast of the earth let's go
[12:42] to justice 129 and we're just stayed in
[12:45] that same chapter once we know that God
[12:48] said behold I have given you every herb
[12:50] bearing seed which is upon the face of
[12:52] all the earth and every tree and in the
[12:55] which is the fruit of a tree and see to
[12:57] you it shall be for me when the next
[12:59] verses don't eat of the fruit of the
[13:01] tree of knowledge of good and evil but
[13:04] this let's compare this scripture was
[13:06] justice 93 and for every moving thing
[13:09] that liveth shall be meat for you even
[13:12] as the green herb by giving you
[13:14] all things 94 plus flesh with a lot
[13:18] fairer which is the blood thereof shall
[13:19] you naughty so started out there is no
[13:23] death in the Garden of Eden Europe only
[13:25] there only eating vegetables vegetarians
[13:29] nothing no life was taken but then it
[13:33] just is not after the club then you can
[13:37] eat meat as long as you don't eat the
[13:38] blood and that not even blood carries
[13:41] over to axe the axe 1521 of the Apostles
[13:44] got together to discuss which which is
[13:46] kind of old Commandments would be
[13:47] carried over and eating blood was one of
[13:51] the things to abstain from along with
[13:53] the only animal strangled because
[13:54] they're both the title taking a life
[13:57] something murder just is 415 and this is
[14:05] the one we've been studying and justice
[14:10] 96 justice for 15 says and the Lord said
[14:13] unto him therefore whosoever slayeth
[14:16] Cain vision shall be taking on Sevenfold
[14:18] in the Lord set a mark upon pain when
[14:20] fighting your killer in this case God is
[14:25] taking just it's taking care of justice
[14:29] and we don't take vengeance no vengeance
[14:31] but God handles and justice now and just
[14:34] as 96 whoso sheddeth man's blood by man
[14:38] shall his blood be shed for in the image
[14:40] of God maybe man so now God hinge over
[14:43] justice to man because we are made in
[14:46] His image were made in His image so we
[14:49] should not be killed oh I should not be
[14:50] taken am because were made in His image
[14:52] we should have the ability
[14:54] to judge right and wrong and be able to
[14:58] determine whether someone is is a worthy
[15:01] of punishment for their further seeing
[15:06] the murder and I i found this what John
[15:10] Wesley said I just like to read what
[15:12] different people that feel all ghosts
[15:16] had seen it this is what he said before
[15:19] the flood is that she's seen by the
[15:20] story of Cain God took the punishment of
[15:24] murder into his own hands but now he
[15:27] committed this judgment two men two
[15:29] masters or families at first and
[15:31] afterwards to the heads of countries for
[15:34] in the image of God made man man is a
[15:36] creature due to his creator and
[15:38] therefore ought to be so to us God put
[15:41] honor upon him let's let us did not then
[15:43] put contempt upon him such remains of
[15:47] God's image are still even upon fallen
[15:49] man that he could unjustly killed a man
[15:51] to face it the image of God and death
[15:54] dishonor to you now as we read along
[15:58] through all the different times when
[16:00] p.m. or punished by death it keep in
[16:03] mind that the thing when sand enters a
[16:06] picture in your life during your family
[16:09] or in your church or in your country
[16:11] which is a lot of the theme is the
[16:15] nation of Israel they're getting rid of
[16:18] the nation X in from the nation then you
[16:22] got to get rid of it home
[16:26] a lot of people think that that what the
[16:30] law of God is to just embrace all sin or
[16:32] everything including sin but the love
[16:35] doesn't love seeing love of God doesn't
[16:39] um this is 321 oh I covered out on an
[16:43] evil bloody sense so God is the first
[16:46] one to he was the first one by his hand
[16:51] was a first blood taken and justice took
[16:55] over our sin and Genesis 423
[17:12] see
[17:14] what kind of jumping the head down
[17:16] through gesture for to disappear so let
[17:26] me we mentioned last time how i met
[17:29] misinterpreted that vengeance is mine as
[17:35] anybody anybody can take videos
[17:38] themselves and so what he did was
[17:42] somebody somebody did something wrong to
[17:45] him and so he decided he was going to
[17:48] take their life and let makes it on
[17:50] these wild Lena Zilly Zilly hear my
[17:52] voice she was a little neck hearken unto
[17:54] my speech for I have slain a man to my
[17:56] wounding and a young man to my hurt and
[18:00] I think that's not what God meant at all
[18:02] I don't believe you that you're someone
[18:06] who does you wrong you take their life
[18:08] let's compare this to David's prayer in
[18:12] Psalm 79
[18:40] Oh
[18:45] let's still down the worst team thanks
[18:48] my first nine help us Oh God about
[18:52] salvation for the glory of thy name and
[18:54] deliver us are Persian way our sins but
[18:56] I named state wherefore should they even
[18:59] say where is their God let it be known
[19:00] when the heat in our site by the
[19:02] revealing of the blood of I shirt
[19:04] servants what you see see Davis leaving
[19:07] it up to God not himself even remember
[19:11] all the stories of how they saw was put
[19:13] into David's hand but he wouldn't take
[19:14] his who wouldn't take videos because it
[19:17] was God anointed and we can learn some
[19:20] lessons about that today but don't say
[19:22] anything about your past or so behind
[19:24] their back get a God's anointed let the
[19:33] sign of the prisoner come before thee
[19:35] according to the greatest honor of that
[19:37] power preserve those that are appointed
[19:40] to die and render under our neighbors
[19:43] Sevenfold into their bosom they were
[19:45] approached wherewith they have a purse
[19:47] thee O Lord the same 74 approaches as a
[19:52] cane but God Dame is leaving it up to
[19:54] God he's not taking matters in his own
[19:56] hand so we die people as cheap of bypass
[19:59] she will give thee thanks forever we
[20:01] will show forth i play to all
[20:03] generations now let's jump on Jesus 611
[20:22] the earth also was corrupt before God
[20:25] and the earth was filled with violence
[20:27] and God looked upon the earth and behold
[20:30] it was corrupt for all flesh had
[20:32] corrupted his way upon the earth and
[20:39] then move it for
[20:43] that's one of the reasons why God
[20:45] destroyed everything they own the earth
[20:47] because it was filled with violence and
[20:48] after flood god for justice and the
[20:51] man's hands to protect ourselves to
[20:55] deliver seeing from our midst and so we
[21:01] can implement justice and then we read
[21:05] in justice 956 who shot Sheriff man's
[21:08] blood by man shot luckyshare when we
[21:12] were comparing that to you on just for
[21:14] 15 so now let's jump up to Genesis 13
[21:23] I'm not going to read the whole thing
[21:25] just kind of quickly talk about the
[21:28] topic here is Abraham and lot I had a
[21:32] little disagreement and instead of
[21:36] getting on vile about it Abraham just
[21:38] peacefully let a lot choose the greenest
[21:41] pastures for himself and justice 14 is
[21:48] the story about how now he was peaceful
[21:51] now lots herdman lot lot gets kidnapped
[21:56] by chit early Omer and so Abraham has
[22:00] aesthetic standing arm or anything me
[22:01] and it gives that to him and it brings
[22:03] him back and that's when he offers
[22:04] temperature ties to visit after he gets
[22:09] the prize from Chile Homer so even
[22:13] though he's a man of peace he's not
[22:15] going to put up with he he's defending
[22:17] himself in this case you know it's
[22:21] perfectly fine to you got a right to
[22:25] defend yourself fear not let's see an
[22:29] apron Justice 15 15 verse one after
[22:35] these things word of the Lord came
[22:36] Monday were having a vision saying
[22:38] through non april i am not sealed and I
[22:42] or even for God's sitting up a thing
[22:48] that he's our defense and he's the one
[22:51] that fights for us justice 17-6
[23:02] and I will make the exceeding fruitful I
[23:05] will make nations of the king lee-char
[23:07] coming out of it my king is a ruler of
[23:15] our nation the nation is going to have
[23:16] to defend itself just 19 is where God
[23:23] destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah from their
[23:25] scenic and then let's turn to another
[23:29] interesting story Deuteronomy chapter 17
[23:44] 17 17
[24:02] just a little later what I want
[24:13] well anyway I'll just tell you the story
[24:16] this is the story of when the Amalekites
[24:18] came to attack the Israelites and what
[24:21] they did instead of just attacking them
[24:24] straight out they tanker stragglers in
[24:27] the back they love women and children
[24:28] and people that could not defend himself
[24:31] and because of that God told Moses to go
[24:37] attack neo and that's that story is an
[24:39] exodus chapter 17 I think that's what I
[24:43] did was just run the same chapter for
[24:45] both
[24:59] this is the story of when Moses Aaron
[25:05] and her went up to the top of the hill
[25:06] and Aaron and Hur held up Moses hands
[25:08] when his handle drop than it is uh the
[25:12] battle would would they start losing and
[25:15] as long as I his hands up and they would
[25:17] prevail and the reason that they will
[25:20] find Anna likes it I'm a licensed
[25:22] because of what they might like I said
[25:24] to them as they were in the wilderness
[25:25] they were you know they were attacking
[25:30] them in a very evil way attacking the
[25:33] feeble not my point do all this is that
[25:38] is that God allow allow the nation of
[25:41] Israel to defend itself Oh God that you
[25:47] got to put seeing out of your out of
[25:49] your midst and that's that's what the
[25:51] natural Old Testament it tightens a
[25:53] natural type of the New Testament
[25:55] spiritual and the Old Testament in take
[25:57] the sword and your riffs in the New
[25:59] Testament we get out on our knees and
[26:01] ask God deliver us even an Old Testament
[26:04] it wasn't by their Shore it was by got
[26:08] this period of Lord that was fighting
[26:09] their bowels but um just kind of an
[26:13] example for us to learn from and then an
[26:20] exodus 17 god promises to only pull out
[26:23] remember something like from under
[26:25] heaven because they
[26:26] they did the Nexus 19 almost time verses
[26:40] 7 through 9 is what we offer me with
[26:42] where Israel rejects grace and takes law
[26:47] and then in Exodus 20 the 10
[26:50] commandments one of which is thou shalt
[26:54] not kill and the Ten Commandments
