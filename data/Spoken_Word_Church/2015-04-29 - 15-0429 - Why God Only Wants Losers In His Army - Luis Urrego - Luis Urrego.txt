read this and then I'll have you be seated and then I just want to give you a quick update um on my mother-in-law so let's let let's read uh 2 Corinthians chapter 4 verse starting at verse one it says therefore seeing we have this ministry as we have received the mercy we faint not but we have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty not walking in craftiness nor handling the word of God deceitfully but by manifestation amen of the truth commending ourselves to Every Man's conscience in the sight of God that's right but if our gospel be hid it is hid to them that are lost in whom the God of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not we know that's Satan right lest the light of the Glorious gospel of Christ who is the image of God should shine unto them for we preach not ourselves very um very different from many people that's what they that's how they do preach themselves for we preach not ourselves but Christ Jesus the Lord am and ourselves your servants for jesus' sake that's what a minister is he's a servant amen verse six for God who commanded the light to shine out of Darkness hath shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ look at verse seven but we have this treasure in other words this light we have this treasure in Earth and vessels am amen think about that think how powerful that is Saints we have this treasure in Earth and vessels that the Excellency of the power may be of God Amen and not of us praise God that's right we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair am persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body hallelujah amen let's just go to the Lord in prayer our heavenly father we thank you Lord for this opportunity that we have to open the back the pages of your word Lord and to read father God the great Treasures that you have in store here upon for us Lord we appreciate you Lord and we just thank you and glorify you this evening Lord for Father God we just pray Lord that as we come before you Lord that your word is going forth may you just bless your people Lord and open our ears of our understanding Lord that we may hear father God what your Holy Spirit would want to say unto us Lord Lord uh allow me to say father God only the things that you'd want me to say Lord anoint my lips Lord God and prevent me from saying anything Lord that I shouldn't father Lord granted father we just commit ourselves into your hands now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen praise the Lord you may be seated tonight praise God Amen I um again it's good to be in the house of the Lord um um I call the I call if it's possible yeah I call uh I call the house of the Lord God's Filling Station amen that's right because it is amen that's right amen every every midweek no Sunday but if you're a gy if you're a car that guzzles up a lot of gas amen Wednesday and Sunday shouldn't be the only time you filling up that's right amen you should be filling up in between now I I take it for example if like if you're um you know if you're driving and I've been in this situation before we've taken long drives to Canada before and the hard-headed hardheadedness that I that I have amen sometimes my wife tells me you need to go fill up I said no we have a little bit more to go I just don't want to get out of the car yet you know but then all of a sudden that needle shows empty and you're wondering I'm like Lord where I need some I need some gasoline Lord help me to be able to get to the next gas station and finally you see that bright light that QT up in the distance amen you know and to me that's like the bright light amen when you come and you want to hear his word you see that bright light spend that quality time that QT with him amen praise God because that and then what happens when you go in there once you once you see that QT you you don't even have the gas yet pumped and you already feel relieved cuz you know you're going to be able to make it amen so you go in there you not just get gas but you also go ahead and get some some potato chips some chocolate some sodas whatever so that you can keep going on the road amen and that's the same thing with the house of the Lord Saints amen you get you get what you need amen and you get also the little extras the fellowship with the brother and the sister amen prayer anything amen God has in store for you amen only if you want it that's right otherwise you're going to be on left on the side of the road without no gas that's right and I'm afraid that's how a lot of people have become amen thank you brother B stuck on the side the road with no gas when God has already given us so much in this hour we have no excuse Saints praise God Amen so uh real quickly I just want to give you an update on my my mother-in-law I know that you all have been praying for her she's doing she's doing very good and um she's on her third round of chemo or getting ready to start her third round of chemotherapy um because of the cancer that that she had but she's expected to um have her um uterus is it the uterus and bladder removed in July because the cancer is in those areas but we're praying that the Lord amen that that that don't has that doesn't have to be done so um but she's been she's been she's been uh very you know even though she's in Canada she's a woman of Faith amen and uh she uh she acts like nothing's wrong with her and that's what she she she she's a Believer and uh so she just so we just we just uh just ask that you continue to pray for her and that uh as she's getting ready to go to this third round of chemo and U I know like brother Benny you know we've been praying for him and he's I guess he's he's deciding on what he's going to do in in that regards but let me tell you my my my mother-in-law she's gone through this chemo and she said she hasn't been feeling any side effects or anything so we just thank God for that amen and uh I believe God can take care of his own amen so um if that brings any encouragement Amen to maybe brother Benny or anybody else that may need it amen God is God is able to take care of his own amen so we just appreciate the Lord amen well tonight um amen was we're reading here in 2 Corinthians chapter 4 um I'm going to talk tonight a little topic about why God only wants losers in his army he he only wants losers in his army amen amen he doesn't want winners now that's kind contr to the way the world thinks about it amen but what he wants is losers in his army and let's read about why amen praise God if we continue reading here going back to verse six amen it says for God who commanded the light to shine out of Darkness amen when God Amen at the beginning said let there be light and out of Darkness amen he created he created something out of nothing when he said let there be light and there was light and you and me were walking in darkness at one point in time amen amen and out of dark darkness amen God was able to make something out of us right now it's been it's been him because it hasn't been you and me praise God like I said before amen you and me just wanted to be out living in the world drinking smoking gambling hanging around with the wrong crowd and doing all these things in darkness but God yet amen out of his mercy and his grace he still calls us out amen until his glorious light praise God and I appreciate his grace to us amen right for hath the light to shine out of Darkness hath shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ what a privilege for us Saints in this hour to know amen the things that we know and not just to know them but to be able to live them amen through the Holy Spirit praise God I have Jehovah's Witnesses that come to my house and I thought that I had left them in Anderson South Carolina but now they're visiting in Georgia too but that's okay it just gives me an opportunity to say speak the gospel to them you know and uh I had some a couple came the other day and uh and uh you know they they I let them speak I let them say what they want to say you know and then they give me some time to speak you know but then you know you perplex them with things like baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I don't really like to deal with Jehovah's Witness in any other way but about Jesus being God Amen because that that stumbles them right there and they just can't accept it you know and so that's I asked them I said well how do you how are you baptized I said in the name of the father Son and Holy Ghost and I went through explaining name baptism of the Lord Jesus Christ and they just rattled their heads you know and they said well um if you we come back again next time amen you could you have could you have some of those scriptures written out first I said sure enough amen but it makes me think it makes me wonder you know at one point in time you know we were we were in that in in that way amen and and they're they're being they're sincere in what they're doing they're just ins sincere and almost more sincere than what you and me are amen when we have this glorious light amen that God has shined on us and they're more sincere than we are amen about the truth that's right brother amen so it it makes you think amen puts us to shame sometimes it should put us to shame verse 7 it says here but we have this treasure in Earth and vessels God chose amen this treasure to be placed in you and me that's right why didn't he choose the the the great giraffe or the great lion or the Tiger or the these great animals that God created but he decided to put it in you and me this treasure amen now I like the way Paul words are here am man because he's talking about well well he says here that the Excellency of the power may be of God and not of us that's right so everything that God does in our lives is for his Ben for his glory amen right to be able to use you amen am that's for his glory and it's not for your own Glory it's so easy for us say to get caught up with me me me me me and my my my my my and it's all about me and what I can do and what I and and nobody else can do it like me and that's wrong Sint in this a in this day and age we are so infatuated with with with um with self-centeredness yeah everything is about me me me that's the reason why you call the the the phone iPhone and it's you uh you know uh Myspace and uh all these different things it's all about me me me me me and and and what I can get out of it right and every that's why people when you're walking around with their iPhones and don't care about anybody else but it's just about me me me and then you take and then the selfie people taking selfies and they it's got to where they actually had to put that word in the dictionary now because everybody's just with a selfie now you know selfie this selfie that why and that word actually comes out of the word selfish so that's that's the age that we're living in Saints and if you're not careful we get caught up in that and and and and and you know we're and and we're wonder you know other people are looking and needing help amen along the way and and you're you're just worried about yourself amen now I don't even know where I was going with that but but we have this treasure in Earth and vessels so that God can get the glory now I like what Paul uses if you look at that word Earth and vessels in verse seven there it refers to ordinary earth andwar right in other words uh uh clay pots that were used by Common People to store valuables or to store things oil and things like that that that was there was a value right yet they used Earth and vessels just regular common Earth and vessels to store these things in so in other words you sisters amen when you go to to um to the Garden Center at Lowe's or to Home Depot or Walmart you go look for and you have this plant you want to plant you go look for an earth and vessel maybe a brown pot to be able to put your your plant in so that way because it's precious to you and you want to take care of it that way it can grow Amen in a in a pretty Earth and vessel amen but now if you want to save some money you go to Walmart and you buy the cheap pot but it's still going to have the same effect you know the plant's still going to grow you see and that's what that's what Paul is talking about God's used take uh takes us as Earth and vessels but that's what he's decided Amen to have something beautiful grow out of Amen regular clay we're not we're not jars from the Ming Dynasty or nothing like that amen we're just regular common Walmart pots amen but that's what God decided to use Amen in this day amen to get his get Glory out of that amen that's why he used a man by the name of William brandham in this day regular common Joe seventh grader right no no offense brother Joe seventh grade education Amen to bring forth the word amen in this our day that's what he wants and that's how he likes it and that's and and that's how he gets the glory amen amen because if if if he chose the greatest intellectual the biggest man in of the hour and everything like that he could be able to say well I did it amen and God doesn't want that amen that's right amen God wants us Amen to be a to be a base amen remember God wants losers in his army and we'll go here we'll get there in just a moment amen praise the Lord so cuz we're nothing but dust made out of the same clay Saints you know there we some of us are taller than others some some of us are short some of us are are a little bit more rounder than others and but brother brandham said what our bodies are are we're worth only about 84 cents and some of us that're a little bit more round they're probably worth 80 89 cents maybe you know but but you know we're we're nothing Saints right we're nothing to be able to think that we could we can we can act like like like we're something and and that the world owes everything to us Saints amen and God can't use a vessel like that God can't use somebody like that exactly right amen some of us dressed up a little bit better some of us look a little stronger amen some of us last a little longer but in the end we all go back to the same place amen but if the Holy Ghost is dwelling within amen it doesn't matter amen praise God so and these Earth and vessels amen that's what God desires to hide his treasures in amen the world goes out here and we're we're just regular people amongst the world but they don't understand that if the Holy Ghost is dwelling within amen you and I amen we're powerful people s but that power that we have is actually should abase us amen should make us humble and not not hotty amen not hottie because then God can't use us God can't use us at all there was a show one time called the Antiques Road Show now I've never watched it but uh what it was about was that these people they would take like these these uh you know like a regular chair or something and they take it to some sort of Judge who knows about the history of different Antiques and things like that and they would they would he would look at it and it'd be just a some chair that they had sitting in a in a basement thought maybe it wouldn't worth anything but when they come to to to to the front of the person and they see it and they say wow this thing's worth worth $200 it's from such and such an age and it was made by such and such a person amen and who would have thought and so the person comes out they're winning 200 300 $5,000 $30,000 for something they thought it was of no value right amen so that that's what and you're valuable Amen in the eyes of God Sint you have some value young people amen you have value in the eyes of God right don't let the world deteriorate the value that you have amen before God amen you're valuable in this hours and God has a plan for you and for you amen that's right you may not know it right now but God has something in store for you for you to do Amen to bring him glory amen praise the Lord I want you to read with me in in the 1 Corinthians chapter 1 1 Corinthians chapter 1 and just bear with me this is a little lengthy but I think it it goes well with what we're we're talking about about here what Paul says because you know Saints Paul had some had a lot to Glory about you know he was he was Pharisee of the Pharisees and you couldn't put a finger in his life but yet he had to give all that up Amen to become one of these Earth and vessels for Christ amen all those things became it he said it became as dung to him amen well one I can't think of anything else lower than than dun Amen to be to be able to use by Christ verse 17 it says in 1 Corinthians 1 says for Christ sent me not to baptize but to preach the gospel not with wisdom of words lest the Cross of Christ should be made of none effect amen for the preaching of the Cross is to them that perish foolishness so in other words to them there are uh uh that have not believed it's it's foolish to the world when you preach the cross right but unto us which are saved it is the power of God Amen for it is written I will destroy the wisdom of the wise and will bring nothing the understanding of the prudent so God is not saying that the world does not have some sort of wisdom or some sort of understanding they do have some sort of wisdom understand but it's not the wisdom of God and it's not the understanding of God which only can come through the Holy Ghost amen for it is written I will destroy the wisdom of the wise and will bring to nothing the understanding of The Prudent where is the wise where is the Scribe where is the disputer of this world hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world Amen they think that they think they have it all figured out but I was telling the other day uh somebody you know they've come out because uh there's there's a documentary about how the uh uh about the Red Sea Crossing and how where where they crossed and there's actually uh they found chariot wheels in that specific area and things like that even bones and fragments of what may be the Egyptians that had that had fallen in there and it it it took like a a technology to be able to gather those things and to find you know aerial views and and photographs and things like that and I was telling the brother I said you know they take this technology that they have invented Amen to try to uh uh you know disprove God and yet with it they Pro they're proving they're proving the Bible correct God just takes it and turns it around on them with the same technology from the from the knowledge tree that they're that they're they're Gathering From so there's knowledge there and they have some sort of wisdom to build this things but God uses those things to Amen to prove his word amen is real it's true where we we here verse 20 verse 21 for after that in the wisdom of God the World by wisdom knew not God it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe so somebody up here slobbering and and and and telling you to repent that's what God decided to use Amen in order to bring forth his word amen for after that see by the foolishness of preaches save them that believe for the Jews require a sign and the Greeks seek after wisdom but we preach Christ crucified unto uh we preach Christ crucified unto the Jews a stumbling block and unto the Greeks foolishness Greeks being you and me but unto them which are called both Jews and Greeks Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God because because the foolishness of God is wiser than man and the weakness of God is stronger than man right so if God had weakness if God had had foolishness that foolishness and that weakness would be stronger than the foolishness and the weakness of of man I like that Saints so you and me have nothing to glory in ourselves Saints cuz all this thing is all these things out here are going to come to not for ye see your calling Brethren how that not many wise men after the flesh um not many mighty not many noble are called but God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise and God had chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are Mighty right amen amen yes just think about the the the ministry of brother Brandon and base things of the world and things which are despised hath God chosen yay and things which are not to bring to not things that are amen that no flesh should glory in his presence amen this is not about you Saints it's about or or me it's about him amen but of him are ye in Christ Jesus who of God has made us unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and Redemption that according as it is written he that glorieth let him glory in the Lord amen that's what it all boils down to that's Amen Let Him Glory in the Lord right thank you Lord now in Matthew chapter 16 and this is where I get my title message Matthew 16: 24 says Jesus speaking he said then said Jesus unto his disciples if any if any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me amen verse 25 says for whosoever will save his life shall lose it other words you try to live for yourself you try to save your own life or you know the you know save and live for yourself you're going to lose it at the End Amen when you think it's about you and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it amen amen so we want to be losers tonight amen yes sir well I want to be a loser amen you know when I was in high school they used to they used to go around uh I don't know if they do it now but I used to go around holding up a a symbol like this and talking about man you're nothing but a loser man loser and I remember that and and and and I'm like man I don't want to be called a loser so what I try to fit in dress in and and and make sure I do the things that they were doing am man so I don't be called No loser I don't want nobody wants to be a loser who wants to be a loser who wants to not not win amen when you're playing basketball or when you're doing these things or maybe at work and you're trying to get that promotion or whatever you don't want to you don't come out losing none of us like to lose right amen but in this case we want to be losers sir in this case we want to lose in order to win amen because that was this that was the testimony that Jesus gave when he was here on Earth right right he got to the the point where he said father forgive them for they know not what they do right and he himself said that do you know he told pilot he said do you know that I could call uh angels and they they would come come and res and rescue me but he didn't do it he didn't use his power for his benefit amen he used his power to glorify the father amen do we do we use the our the power that God has given us through the Holy Spirit to glorify him and so many people in this hour they you you they try it's all about them and it's all about me and it's all about right about uh uh my Ministry and and when when reality it's the ministry of the bride of Christ not the ministry of just one man it's the ministry of the bride of Christ in this hour amen it's a many it's a it's God's working in a many member body so you have an important role you have an important role you have an important role you have an important role each and every one of us has a role to play amen and I told I told uh the Sunday school class before I I told him I said you know each one of us has gifts in our life that God has placed and we have to know how to use those gifts amen and we have to recognize the gifts that God give us but now when you have an apple tree that's growing out here or some form or some tree the apples that grow on that tree those apples are not for the tree to enjoy right those apples are for you and me to enjoy those fruits of the tree are for you and I to enjoy from those the benefits of those fruit not for you and not for you so that's the same thing with the gifts that God has given us is for other people to enjoy to benefit off of them not for you to benefit or to glor glory in what you can do amen about me me me me right no it's all about him Saints cuz he was the one who gave it to you yes sir amen it's not you didn't you didn't get it yourself and if you look at brother bram's life he could have used that gift for for for his own gain but he knew it wasn't his gift it was it was God's Gift amen praise God now if you look at that word lose in the Greek Lexicon it's very interesting it's the word apy and it is it means to perish to uh destroy to lose to be lost says here to destroy to put out of the way entirely yeah entirely to abolish to put an end to ruin to render useless amen can you render yourself useless so that God can use you Amen to kill to declare that one must be put to death to devote or give over to Eternal misery ah so that's what Jesus was talking about yeah amen if you lose your life then you will gain it amen but if you try to gain your life in this life amen you're going to lose it at the end some people in this in this world they they they're so caught up with just making money money money money and I need to make certain millions of dollars before I get to this certain age and I need to get to this point this point and then they lost the purpose of what they're living life for they lost the purpose and at the end they may have gotten all the money in the world but they've lost their soul young people you may have gained all the friends in the world you may have gained all the popularity in the world you may have gained all these all these things of the world and then at the end you end up losing your soul for some friend or some some some popularity you know all the friends that I used to have and I try that I try to act cool in front and try to smoke cigarettes in front of and stuff like that they're not anywhere anywhere be near me anywhere I don't know where they're at now and they probably don't even want to know anything about me you know and that's just how it is it's just a temporal pleasure for just just a moment am so that you can feel good for just a moment but that's not going to last forever amen what matters is what you do for God and what you do and you feed feeding your soul amen so uh God prefers losers amen because he prefers people who can who can recognize their weaknesses amen who can recognize that they need more of him that's the reason why God need wants losers in his army amen and we're in his army amen we're all battling and we're all this is not a picnic amen but God wants us Amen to give ourselves holy to him amen because he wants people to cry out to him amen he wants people to to to deny themselves amen so that they can gain more of him now in 2 Corinthians 4:1 and this ties directly uh or this verse right here ties directly to 2 Corinthians 4:10 it says always bearing about in the body of the dying uh the body the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body amen right so day by day that's the reason why take up your he said take up your cross and follow me right amen Paul said I Die daily amen amen why so that the the the the the the the glory of Jesus Christ may be able to to to dwell amen and to reflect on the outside Amen in front of this world who what they really want to see is a is is is Jesus Christ but they could they don't see it anywhere else that's right you and me have the opportunity to show them Jesus Christ amen cuz they find it and they try to look and and and everybody is pretending that they're living for Jesus Christ everybody out here is pretending to show them what Jesus Christ is about and they're not really satisfied with that they want to see the true Jesus Christ and you and me have the opportunity to show that to them saints amen so always bearing about in the body the D in the Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body I trust that that's your desire amen amen that you want the life of Jesus Christ to always be manifested not just in you but outside amen because what's out in in you amen will manifest on the outside right whatever's in you it's going to come out some way or another you might be hiding it for a little while but eventually it'll come out God will put you in some sort of situation that you'll show your true colors say Jonas uh I mean not Jonas but the um um the the the the the disciple that killed himself that that Judas Judas he eventually showed his true colors right he eventually showed what was in himly although he could cast out devils and heal the sick and and do all these things that God that Jesus had given them power to do right right and that power that he gave him was was was to do all these things but he couldn't they could he could not receive the the damous power which is the power amen that that that that that changes you from the inside out amen that's right he only had the uh the uh I forgot the other power that that that was there but it's the Greek word he only had the power to just do external things but he didn't have the power Amen to change from the inside out amen that's why the reason he showed his true colors at the end right now I want you to I want you all to consider the roll call of God's imperfect Heroes amen yeah now you to the world they have Heroes and this and all they talk about now is the Avengers and Captain America and Spider-Man and the Hulk and Wolverine and all these things you know why cuz the world is looking for a hero the world wants something amen something powerful something something big right but I want you to look at the heroes that God used and I want you to see amen I want you to see that Noah he got drunk one time yet God was able to use Noah God Noah was a saved person Abraham he lied about his wife but yet he was the man of the of that hour that God was using Sarah laughed at God one time and she didn't really literally just just laugh but she just giggled right yet she was she's spoken of so well of in Hebrews like she didn't do anything right amen Jacob was a deceiver y one of the biggest deceivers I've ever I've ever seen you read the the stories yet God changed his name to to to Israel and he fought fought with the angel wrestle with the angel and and he said I'm not going to leave here until you bless me cuz why God knew his heart amen amen God knew he was a prince yes sir Moses he murdered an Egyptian one time yet God took him and and changed him and let him see GL that it's not about Moses yep that's right it's about what God was going to do through him amen and he was able to bring out the the uh the the Israel uh the Israelites Rahab she was a harlot but she believed amen that the the the the message that the spies told her to do she let left that that the the uh Scarlet robe out Y and she believed it amen right and because of that she took action amen and because of that her and her household was saved yet she was a harlot Gideon he was fearful abely didn't want to go fight he didn't want to go do none of these things but God needed to use him see it's it's God God needs to use weak people right that's right that's BS down God needs to use people with weaknesses so that he can get Glory right amen right look at all these all these Heroes that we think of in the Bible Gideon Noah Abraham all these things yet they had these weaknesses in their lives they were losers right there were nothing but a bunch of losers but God Amen made them winners Samson had serious problems with lust and anger and at the end he said Lord just one more time he came back to his senses amen he said Lord one more time amen and and he recognized spiritually where he needed to be and he killed amen he was able to kill more Philistines that his death than what he did when he was living Eli he failed as a father because of his two sons but yet he was a priest y David he was an adulterer and a murderer yet God said he's a man after my own heart right amen think about that amen my amen Solomon married foreign wives who turned his heart to Idol towards idolatry but he had he he was the most wise man that was ever that ever lived and he built the the the the the the the temple yes that's right Elijah struggled with depression and the Elijah of our day he struggled with things Tred like that he was a nervous man he was he was weak he didn't want to do what he what he was called to do that's right and none of us amen that that if we have a calling from God we don't we don't we don't want to a lot of people say well I want to preach I want to do this you better be careful you better be careful cuz you don't know what you're getting into I would not want to be in the shoes that brother Brandon was in that Ministry amen that God chose him specifically he knew he was able to to work with him and to work that Ministry in his life but he went through a lot so Elijah he struggled with depression Jonah ran away from God but God still used them out of the mouth of mouth of a uh the mouth of a whale right Peter he denied Christ but Jesus had already told him I'd give you the Keys of the Kingdom he said I already prayed for you Peter he said Satan's going to try to sift you like wheat amen but I already prayed for you amen don't worry yet he denied Christ but Jesus didn't reject him he knew Peter would come back Paul he was complicit to murder and one time he argued with Barnabas oh but Christians they don't argue with each other Believers though they you know I heard one time when they when I when I was I was thinking you know when they talk about perfect love and everything is perfect love and we're all walking down the the the fields you know holding hands the roses are red and the violets are blue and everything is nice and Rosy while we're walking in this Christian way yeah and when we come to church we don't you know we don't have you know to deal with each other and God sometimes places a certain brother or a certain sister right there to try our patience but it's to see what you're going to do right and he's also dealing with the other brother and the sister too see God knows what he's doing and Paul the man of the hour the great man that he was yet he argued with Barnabas one day and they had to separate ways and Barnabas he compromised the gospel James and John wanted special seats in the Kingdom hey you you know you see you see that you see that you know I want to be better than you you know I have this position you know higher than you that spirit always off all stands out from there James and John they wanted special seats in the kingdom and all the apostles argued about who was the greatest right right but yet God used all these all these people amen at the end why because when the Holy Ghost is in charge amen it doesn't matter what you did amen doesn't matter if it's under the blood amen and then you your your desires have changed to know that you are glorifying him and you're going your life is dedicated to him amen all these things amen don't matter anymore God still God still can use you amen God still can use you so I remember the the time when when brother Brandon amen when he was in that in that restaurant and he was when he was there uh um condemning the the the lady right who who uh who was sitting there with a police officer and you know carousing and things and and he was there condemning he's like I can't believe this and then God says come here son takes him to a corner that's right back of the restaurant and he says look and he shows him that bumper of blood amen and that his s were the ones who put that who put him there on the cross oh but brother brandom he didn't make any mistakes but God wasted his time showing him that Vision then look that's what people think you know but brother brandom amen his sins put him on the cross just as our sins put him on the cross as well amen right and from there amen he left a different man exactly he left a different man he said I'm not one to condemn people and what he do what happened afterwards he went and talked to the lady and come to find out she was just in a backsliding condition right and she got saved right there right there amen right so when we have our minds changed amen that it's about him not about us amen God can do great things in our midst praise God going move a little quickly here judges if you want to read in judges chap uh chapter 7 this is the story of Gideon one of the heroes of God I want you to I want you to look at this real quick uh I'll read these verses here real quick then jobal who is Gideon and all the people that were with him rose up early and pitched beside the well of Herod so that the host of midianites were on the north north side of them by the hill of Mora in the valley and the Lord said unto Gideon the people that are with thee are too many to for me to give the midianites into their hands lest Israel vaun themselves against me saying my own hand hath saved me so what Jesus was what God was talking about here was that that he Gideon had a group of people and and God said you you have too many right yeah he said I don't want you to because I don't want you I don't want all these people to be fighting the fearful and Afraid let him return and depart early from Mount Gilead and their return of the people 20 and 2,000 22,000 and there remain 10,000 and the Lord said unto Gideon the people so now it's now down to from 22,000 now to 10,000 the people are yet too many God said bring them down onto the water and I will try them for there for thee there and it shall be that of whom I say unto to thee this shall go with thee the same shall go with thee and of whomsoever I say unto thee this shall not go with thee the same shall not go right so he brought down the people unto the water and the Lord said unto Gideon everyone that laeth of the water with his tongue as a dog laeth him uh lap laeth him shalt thou set by himself likewise everyone that bow down upon his knees to drink and the number of them that laed put in their hand to their mouth were 300 men but all the rest of the people bowed down upon their knees to to drink water so there was some that were lapping like a dog you know you know and then there were some that were taking the water and drinking you know and and so so the Lord says here and the Lord said unto Gideon by 300 men that La will will I save you and deliver the median ites into thine hand and let all the other people go every man unto his place so the people took took victuals in their hand and their trumpets and he sent all the rest of Israel man unto his tent and retained those 300 men and the host of midium was was beneath him in the valley and it came to pass that same night that the Lord said unto him arise get thee down unto the host for I have delivered into thine hand so God had already given them the people but it took down it took God Amen bringing down amen from 22,000 to 300 people and because through these 300 people God was able to give them the victory amen so God doesn't need big armies God doesn't need none of this thing he just needs somebody dedicated to him amen somebody willing to lose their life amen because God only wants the glory to himself amen amen that that's what this is all about God wants glory for him himself amen amen praise God brother brandom says here in the message isn't that in the message prayer line he says isn't that beautiful Jesus Christ saying now you all believe John he was a prophet he just preached the way you all went and believed him and you know he was a prophet though he never done one Miracle but he was the greatest Prophet that ever lived Jesus said so until this time said never was a man born of a woman as great as John the Baptist he never done one miracle and only lived 6 months but why was he so great because he bore a record of Christ and when you see somebody giving God praise and God glory then you can realize that that person's coming from God right isn't that giving God the glory that's right and John said I must decrease and he must increase amen you know that was the testimony of John they said are you the Messiah he said I'm nothing but Jesus Jesus come around and said oh yes he is he's the greatest from among women that's better don't you think look what brother BR says here let somebody else say it right amen live so that somebody else will say it that's the way to do it do the right thing somebody God will bear record for you amen John went off the scene and he didn't make himself a great person he just did what he was called to do and Jesus was the one who bragged about him later on Amen and that's the thing that we should do Saints I always think of that scripture amen and I I think brother Dell brought it out here a couple of months ago you know when when you have the opportunity you know when Jesus said you have the opportunity to to have the higher seat you know back in the the podium or whatever you know but you go Jesus said go take the low seat you know exactly right and then later on they want to they can call you up and say but let them let them exalt you and and not you try to exalt yourself amen because that's that's amen that that uh that's what brings glory to God we can humble ourselves amen it should come to a point Saints amen that we we could get to the point that you know Jesus confound Satan so much and he didn't know if is was the son of God or if he wasn't the Son of God you know and it should come to the point amen that that that women that the Earth the world would think you know well I know that him or she can't do it I know him or her I know how they were so it can't be them amen it's got to be it's got to be something else than them amen it's got to be more than than them because I knew them when they were out in the world I knew them amen it's got to be more it's got to be God working in you Saints amen that's the point that's to the point where we have to be at Paul says here in 2 Corinthians says in verse 7 it says and lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of Revelations there was given to me a thorn in the flesh the messenger of Satan to Buffet me lest I should be exalted above measure for for for this thing I besought the Lord Thrice that it may that I that it might depart from me and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness amen my strength is made perfect in losers amen most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities that the power of Christ May rest upon me amen amen again it's all about Christ amen so God told God told Paul he said my grace is sufficient and you don't have to understand it you don't have to my grace is enough just keep moving on right my grace is sufficient and I don't understand everything Saints I don't know I don't know all things I just know his grace is enough and he he'll he'll allow me to know amen what he wants me to know at the right time as as long as I stay humble before him amen therefore I take pleasure in infirmities can you say that Saints am in necessities and persecutions and distresses for Christ's sake for when I am weak then I am strong so when I become a loser then I will live Amen in other words is what Paul is saying praise God so how many want to be losers tonight Amen brother Wade wants to be a loser yes sir God bless him I want to be a loser too I rais both of my hands amen but a loser in a loser for Christ amen don't don't take that in the wrong way you know exactly right that's right praise God but I'm going to lose myself Amen to that gain more of him amen because that's it if if you're in the way he can't use you and the more the he can only use what what you give him what what you give him if you only give him an arm to use that's all he's going to be able to use a leg to use that's all he's going to use but if you give him your whole body to use amen that's what he's going to use amen he'll do great things through you it doesn't matter if you think you're ugly doesn't matter if you think you're big doesn't matter if you think you're you're you know whatever have too many freckles on your face whatever God still can use youen and God may have you maybe not to preach maybe not to be a deacon maybe not to do something good great in the church or whatever but maybe just for you to be a witness to somebody a visitor that came in one time maybe it's you who is going to bring and Lead that person to Christ you know young people you know you think that you can't do you can't do that but you can be used by Christ even at this point if you let the holy spirit amen your testimony amen will either draw them away or will bring them closer am amen praise God um I going to give a little a little little a little story I I read the other day and um it's about this little 10-year-old boy I thought it was really neat about a little 10-year-old boy who Who had who was in a car accident and he had lost his left arm well as he was recuperating he decided he wanted to uh he wanted to take up Judo so he went to the to the sensei in the area and he said he said master I want you to teach me how to how to how to do Judo he said that's no problem I can teach you so day in and day out he would he would he would meet with his Sensei and the Sensei would only teach him one move just one move and day in Day Out he would go and he'd practice with the Sensei and it would be just one move that he would he would they would he would practice one day the boy got SK he he was got skep he was wondering and he asked the the the the Sensei he said he said Master I've been coming to you quite some time now and every time that I come all you teach me is the same move and he and the master told him he said Son you only this is the only move that you'll ever need so the boy he just took it he just took it in faith he said well I know what the master the master knows what he's doing and he just continued and I you know I wish we could take God that way like he told Paul he said but my grace is sufficient just keep moving on so the boy day in day out and one day there was a tournament that was to take place and the boy qualified to be part of this tournament and he fought in two of the F the first two the first two matches he fought and he was able to win just with this one move then the third match that he fought it was a little rougher but that person that got carried away didn't do something properly and he was able to beat this third person uh uh and he won the match with the same move and the boy still wondering he's like I what in the world how is it that this move can can with this I can I can win and so the boy was able to make it to the championship and so here comes at the championship ship this great bigger person than him Burly person and uh the referee got so scared of him because he saw that he had a a weakness and he he he had his left hand was gone and he said how in the world is he going to be able to beat this and he actually told the Sensei he said he said sir I don't think your boy should fight and the Sensei had so much confidence in him he said I know I know I have confidence in him I know that he can win it so he lets the boy fight well the as he's fighting the the the his opponent makes one wrong move and sure enough the boy does that that move and he wins and he wins the championship so they win the championship they're celebrating the trophy is is is is in his hand and him and the Sensei they're driving back home and he's asking the Sensei he said Sensei I still don't understand why it is day and day out this is all you trained me and I was able to win all these matches and he in the sense they say son look he said the thing is is that this one move is one of the hardest moves in Judo to do he said but you've done it so much that you've mastered it and he said and the only way that you can defend that move is by the person grabbing your left hand your left arm and you don't have a left arm so his weakness became his strength his weakness became his strength so you think you think my goodness I have these freckles on my face I have I I can't do nothing I don't know how to sing be front of the church whatever it may be whatever you you think might be your weakness God can take that weakness and use it for Glory of amen for his glory am it doesn't matter God knows what he's doing just like the Sensei he knew exactly what he was doing cuz he that's the reason why he had confidence in the boy he taught him well with just that one move right and God has given us everything that we need needed Saints for this hour cuz he knows that you and me can win and we're going to win why because we become losers that's right amen losers in Christ amen praise the Lord how many love the Lord tonight amen praise the Lord let's stand to our feet amen praise the Lord why God wants losers in his army amen amen praise God God Amen let's just

enjoy the message let's brother I believe the weaker we get the stronger he can get but if we think we're something it just won't work that's right we were going to a Minister's meeting one time and and most of you know Sam's Gap going up into Tennessee is really crooked and a lot of walls right along the side of you and things you know that no way and it's it's just lot it's hard for two cars let alone anything else we were going up one night and I was driving brother Tom's van there one day and and uh start to go around this curve and here comes a tractor trailer meeting us and the tractor part of it was all already over into my side of the road and he was coming in the curve with me so you know where the trailer was coming and right beside of us was a sheer straight wall I mean just rock cut down when we got out of that brother Tom said how did you do that I said Tom I done that just the way I get a sermon to preach I just put it in his hands cuz there was no way for us to meet in there like that something took over took care of it so you just put it in his hands you know recognize how weak you are you know recognize that then you'll see how strong he can make you all of those great warriors that there in the Bible they all had flaws and problems but you know God turn around and take the flaws and make it a great thing that's right make it a great thing so it is
