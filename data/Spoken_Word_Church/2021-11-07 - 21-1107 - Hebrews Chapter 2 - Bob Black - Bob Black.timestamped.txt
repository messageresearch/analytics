[0:00] bless you thanks good to be in the house
[0:01] of the lord we had a good time at bible
[0:04] study last night
[0:10] so let's let's study some more bible
[0:12] we're going through hebrews we got we
[0:14] made it to hebrews chapter two last last
[0:16] sunday so let's keep going through
[0:18] through that um if the brothers can pull
[0:20] that up we'll just read through again
[0:22] real quick just to set the context
[0:25] and paul said in hebrews chapter two
[0:26] therefore we ought to give the more
[0:28] earnest he to the things which we have
[0:29] heard lest at any time we should let
[0:31] them slip for the word spoken by angels
[0:33] was steadfast and every transgression
[0:35] and disobedience received a just
[0:36] recompense of reward how shall we escape
[0:39] if we neglect so great salvation
[0:41] which at the first began to be spoken by
[0:43] the lord and was confirmed unto us by
[0:44] them that heard him
[0:46] god also bearing them witness both with
[0:48] signs and wonders and with divers
[0:49] miracles and gifts of the holy ghost
[0:51] according to his own will for unto the
[0:53] angels hath he not put in subjection the
[0:54] world to come wherever we speak but one
[0:57] in a certain place testified saying what
[0:59] is man that thou art mindful of him but
[1:00] the son of man that thou visited him
[1:03] thou madest him a little lower than the
[1:04] angels thou crowned him with glory and
[1:06] honor and to set him over the works of
[1:08] thy hands that was put all things and
[1:11] subjection under his feet and friend
[1:12] that he put all and subjection under him
[1:14] he left nothing that is not put under
[1:16] him but now we see not yet all things
[1:19] put under him
[1:20] but we see jesus on the next slide
[1:25] now there's there's your
[1:27] a good evidence that something's
[1:28] happened
[1:29] when you see jesus
[1:31] but we see jesus who was made a little
[1:33] lower than the angels for the suffering
[1:35] of death crowned with glory and honor
[1:36] that he by the grace of god should take
[1:38] death for every man for it became him
[1:41] for whom are all things and by whom are
[1:43] all things in bringing many sons into
[1:44] glory to make the captain of their
[1:46] salvation perfect through sufferings
[1:49] for both he that sanctifieth and they
[1:51] who are sanctified are all of one for
[1:53] which cause he is not ashamed to call
[1:55] them brethren
[1:56] saying i will declare thy name unto my
[1:58] brethren in the midst of the church will
[2:00] i sing praise unto thee and again i will
[2:02] put my trust in him and again behold i
[2:05] and the children which god has given me
[2:07] for as much then as the children are
[2:09] partakers of flesh and blood he also
[2:11] himself likewise took part of the same
[2:13] that through death he might destroy him
[2:15] that had the power of death that is the
[2:17] devil
[2:19] and on the next slide and deliver them
[2:21] who through fear of death were all their
[2:23] lifetimes subject to bondage
[2:25] for verily he took not only the nature
[2:27] of angels but he took on him the seed of
[2:29] abraham wherefore in all things it
[2:32] behooved him to be made like unto his
[2:33] brethren that he might be a merciful and
[2:35] faithful high priest in things
[2:37] pertaining to god
[2:38] to make
[2:39] reconciliation for the sins of the
[2:42] people
[2:42] for in that he himself hath suffered
[2:44] being tempted he is able to sucker them
[2:46] that are tempted
[2:48] on the next slide we'll just kind of do
[2:50] a little quick background
[2:51] of of verse one where it says therefore
[2:54] we ought to give the more earnest he to
[2:56] the things which we have heard lest at
[2:57] any time we should let them slip
[2:59] and brother branham kind of outlined we
[3:01] all we ought to be to we shouldn't let
[3:04] we've heard so many things so let's
[3:07] let's not let these things slip it's so
[3:09] easy to to just uh take for granted the
[3:11] things we've heard and and and uh
[3:14] and not not busy ourselves not make
[3:16] ourselves lively stones with the word
[3:18] that we've heard so we said we ought to
[3:19] be busy every minute trying to get
[3:21] people to christ
[3:22] we ought to be concerned we ought to be
[3:24] lively stones songs we should never be
[3:26] slothful like we are
[3:29] and that that quote i read last sunday
[3:32] that kind of got a reaction
[3:34] we'll go up to church and we'll see the
[3:35] lord jesus do something or bless us in
[3:37] such a way and then we'll go back out
[3:39] and say very nice meeting in other words
[3:42] it would just kind of it kind of it
[3:44] doesn't it doesn't really uh
[3:47] stick that something's taking place in
[3:49] our life we begin to just kind of take
[3:51] it for granted the the word that god has
[3:53] given to us in this age
[3:56] now the next slide
[3:59] uh and brother i'm also sitting and then
[4:01] we see those things take place that we
[4:02] do see take place
[4:04] enough we should never let these things
[4:06] slip we just let it go through our
[4:08] fingers that's what's the matter with
[4:09] the great pentecostal church today they
[4:11] let the very cream of the crop slipped
[4:13] through their fingers when they had it
[4:14] in their hand had wood in their hands
[4:17] had the very the
[4:18] the full revelation of the bible in in
[4:21] their hands and they they just let us
[4:22] they didn't recognize what it was
[4:25] i i wonder are we recognizing what we've
[4:28] got in our in our grasp that the things
[4:30] that have been probed at over the years
[4:32] now we've got the full revelation we've
[4:33] got access we've got access to what paul
[4:36] said are the way of escape we've got
[4:39] access to a way to get out of here a way
[4:41] to get out of our ideas and and and to
[4:43] get out of the bondage that the devil
[4:45] has put us in to to get out of the fear
[4:47] of death
[4:48] um and he said look what they've done
[4:50] they've done like the rest of the
[4:52] churches they run in the game in the way
[4:53] of korra and perished in the way of cain
[4:55] and perished in the gang saying of cora
[4:59] now on the next slide
[5:01] brother ram goes on to talk about don't
[5:03] don't let things slip and one way you
[5:04] can let things slip is when you begin to
[5:06] get in your mind
[5:08] there's always going to be divisions
[5:10] amongst people people have different
[5:11] ideas and when you get them out around
[5:13] people somebody somebody's not going to
[5:15] see predestination the way that you do
[5:17] or the statue of perfect man or or what
[5:19] the new birth really is but not not to
[5:22] let not not ever see he's saying don't
[5:24] don't get dis-unified but let's the way
[5:27] that you can help one another out is is
[5:29] to go out to lunch with somebody and
[5:30] talk to talk about things the way that
[5:32] you can help one another out is to share
[5:34] things and and to not not dis fellowship
[5:37] but to actually you know like jesus he
[5:39] would he would uh
[5:41] and he got a lot of slack flack for it
[5:44] would he would go out and fellowship
[5:46] with sinners and republicans and and uh
[5:48] prostitutes and you know the woman the
[5:50] woman at the well standing there
[5:51] fellowship with her even though you know
[5:54] you look at that situation why why are
[5:55] you talking to that to those people
[5:58] and so brother brown said how did the
[5:59] indians lose this country to the white
[6:01] man they were fighting one among each
[6:03] other they would have held their grounds
[6:05] if they had all come together how are we
[6:07] going to lose it because we're
[6:09] disunified how we lose our experience
[6:11] with god is because we disunify we
[6:14] should never be divided we might differ
[6:16] in ideas but let's be heart and heart
[6:18] brother now there's when you really know
[6:20] that you you're loving one another when
[6:21] you when you disagree about something
[6:23] but you can sit down and and eat and eat
[6:26] bread and talk about things
[6:28] and that's one of the hardest things for
[6:30] people to do is actually listen to one
[6:32] another so many times we want to we want
[6:34] to sit across the table and we want
[6:36] we're so quick to
[6:37] to think of the next thing that we can
[6:39] clock somebody over the head with
[6:40] instead of actually listening sometimes
[6:42] if we listen to one another we'll find
[6:44] out that maybe we're closer to one
[6:45] another than we really that we really
[6:47] thought we were
[6:49] we might different ideas but let's be
[6:51] heart and heart brothers god wants us to
[6:52] be he died for the entire church of god
[6:55] and we do not want to be disunified
[6:59] now one example of that i put over there
[7:01] to the side is in mark chapter nine you
[7:03] know before they before the disciples
[7:04] got the new birth they they had a lot of
[7:07] they had a lot of problems they were
[7:08] wanting to see who was the biggest and
[7:10] wanting to see who was the greatest and
[7:11] that's that's a quick way to be
[7:12] dis-unified is when you're fighting over
[7:14] who the biggest can be
[7:16] and john said john answered john john
[7:19] the beloved put his head on jesus's
[7:21] breast john said that
[7:23] what a surprise john
[7:25] the one that you know everybody's
[7:26] looking he's the
[7:29] the one that everybody said love john
[7:31] typed love and everything he said master
[7:33] we saw one casting out devils in thy
[7:36] name and he followed without us and we
[7:37] forbade him because he followeth not us
[7:39] in other words he's not part of our
[7:41] little group here he's not group so we
[7:42] we said you not even why are you casting
[7:45] out devils if you're not in our little
[7:47] group
[7:48] but jesus said forbid him not for there
[7:50] is no man which shall do a miracle in my
[7:52] name that can lightly speak evil of me
[7:54] for he that is not against us is on our
[7:57] part
[7:58] so
[8:00] don't let things slip by letting that's
[8:03] how the devil the devil will get in you
[8:05] and try to in an assembly and try to try
[8:08] to tear things apart by by using little
[8:10] division using little things that that
[8:12] are different differences among us to
[8:13] try to split us apart
[8:15] so that's what brother brown talks about
[8:16] on the next slide he said there's some
[8:18] little things stars
[8:20] now now remember we're we're talking
[8:22] about hebrews 2 1 unless that any time
[8:24] we should let them slip these they let
[8:26] these truths slip
[8:28] so brother ram said there's some little
[8:29] things stars and from there it begins to
[8:31] roll that's the same thing starts in a
[8:33] church a little tattle starts in the
[8:35] church i i don't think that some brother
[8:38] is preaching it the right way i think
[8:39] he's i think he really believes it this
[8:41] way or i i you know what i don't think
[8:43] that person is living right or whatever
[8:45] starts a little something something goes
[8:46] out
[8:47] a little tattle starts in the church and
[8:49] it rolls up into a place that'll break
[8:51] the church up and separate it that's
[8:53] what broke up the pentecostal group
[8:55] that's what makes them about 20 or 30
[8:57] different organizations that's what
[8:59] broke up the lutherans and now we're 900
[9:01] and something different organizations of
[9:03] all the protestant churches is it
[9:05] because some little something started we
[9:08] should not be divided we should be one
[9:11] church one brethren one brotherhood
[9:13] standing shoulder to shoulder in these
[9:15] days now that doesn't mean we don't
[9:17] stand for the truth that we don't we
[9:18] don't stand for what we believe in but
[9:20] if there's a little division right you
[9:22] don't immediately you don't just throw
[9:23] somebody out just because there's
[9:24] difference
[9:26] and in matthew 18 it says
[9:28] jesus jesus said who is the greatest in
[9:30] the kingdom of heaven
[9:32] and jesus called a little child unto him
[9:34] and set him in the midst of them and
[9:35] said verily i say unto you accept you be
[9:37] converted and become his little children
[9:39] you shall not enter into the kingdom of
[9:41] heaven
[9:42] a little child the child just wants to
[9:43] be taught just wants to tell me what to
[9:45] do and he's not concerned on the
[9:46] playground about who's big and who's
[9:48] little they're just there to have fun
[9:50] we're just you'd be as a little child
[9:52] you just come to church and you just if
[9:54] you want to be be a real christian just
[9:56] come to church and enjoy the fellowship
[9:58] of the lord and not try to be big he
[10:00] said whosoever therefore shall humble
[10:01] himself as this little child the same as
[10:04] greatest in the kingdom of heaven
[10:06] and we know these things but it's good
[10:08] to rehearse and rehash a little bit
[10:09] sometimes
[10:11] and on the next slide brother brown said
[10:13] so
[10:14] paul said for if the word spoken by
[10:17] angels was steadfast now here's where we
[10:20] we talked when we were going through
[10:21] hebrews chapter one we talked about what
[10:23] angels were and this is where brother
[10:24] brown really rehashes it again when he
[10:26] preached the message hebrews chapter two
[10:29] what is the name what's paul talking
[10:30] about an angel he said now angel is the
[10:32] messenger the word angel means messenger
[10:35] and just got through in the first book
[10:36] here
[10:37] god in sundry times in diverse manner a
[10:40] lot of different ways a lot of different
[10:41] times
[10:42] spoke to the fathers by the prophets
[10:45] that was god's messengers the prophets
[10:49] was god's angels they were god's angels
[10:51] now these are brother rams words they
[10:53] were god's angels so that's who that's
[10:55] who paul is talking about for if the
[10:56] word spoken by angels was
[10:58] steadfast and every transgression and
[11:00] disobedience received a just recommended
[11:03] for reward how shall we escape
[11:06] a messenger is an angel or an angel is
[11:08] the messenger rather and on the next
[11:09] slide he said you're a messenger this
[11:11] morning you've got in other words you've
[11:13] got a message of the good news you got
[11:15] something to carry to your family to
[11:17] your work
[11:19] when when somebody's down harder that
[11:20] you work you've got something positive
[11:22] to share with them because you're a
[11:24] messenger you've got something little
[11:26] mama's in the kitchen making bread or
[11:28] whatever doing you got you got a message
[11:30] for your kids
[11:32] that you can be a preacher to your
[11:34] family and tell them tell your kids how
[11:36] to be born again or whatever
[11:39] he said you're a messenger this morning
[11:41] you're a messenger of good news or a
[11:43] messenger of bad news oh isn't it
[11:45] beautiful to know that we are
[11:46] ambassadors that we are angels the
[11:48] messengers of the resurrection and we
[11:51] are god's messengers to the sinful world
[11:53] that christ lives in our hearts he lives
[11:56] in our spirits
[11:58] he lives
[11:59] now that's
[12:00] that's that's the gospel message is that
[12:02] he's alive he's not laying in the grave
[12:05] he's not laying up in the grave up there
[12:07] in jeffersonville brother branham he's
[12:09] alive today
[12:10] and and we'll get into that a little bit
[12:12] more as
[12:13] as paul carries on in this chapter that
[12:15] he's alive that's that's a that's a
[12:17] that's the evidence that's the evidence
[12:19] in you that something's happened is he's
[12:21] alive his nature is there now on the
[12:24] next on the next slide he said forth the
[12:25] word spoken by angels was steadfast
[12:29] steadfast means it's something that you
[12:31] can have confidence in and he said their
[12:33] word was steadfast in the old testament
[12:35] if the word spoken by angels were
[12:37] steadfast that he said that way it had
[12:39] to be right in other words you can't you
[12:42] know when a minister gets somebody
[12:44] behind the pulpit it would be a whole
[12:45] lot easier if you could just say
[12:47] whatever popped into your head but we've
[12:49] got to have something steadfast we've
[12:51] got to have something that you can
[12:52] compare back to the word
[12:54] so you
[12:56] in the old testament they have the urim
[12:58] and thumb that they would they would
[12:59] they would stand before and say say a
[13:01] prophecy or say something that to
[13:03] compare back against something the light
[13:05] would flash across that urem thumb in
[13:07] the new testament the urem thumb is the
[13:09] word so everything has got to compare
[13:12] back to the word it would be it would be
[13:14] nice if we could just say well i had i
[13:16] had a vision or i had a dream about
[13:18] something or i know what the
[13:19] interpretation of the dream is or
[13:20] whatever but you've got to take
[13:22] everything back to the word because
[13:24] that's what steadfast is brother i said
[13:26] in the old testament before words god
[13:28] prophet's word could be made manifest it
[13:30] had to be examined and proved it's got
[13:33] to be examined and proved it wasn't
[13:34] loose with it like we are today just go
[13:36] out and have any kind of a sensation or
[13:38] anything or any kind of a sensation see
[13:41] i felt something or i i saw something or
[13:43] i saw a light come down that's that's
[13:45] great and we believe in the power of god
[13:47] we believe in god doing things but you
[13:49] got to take it back to the word
[13:52] he said oh glory to god that's it you're
[13:54] mistaken
[13:56] if you just look if you base everything
[13:57] on a sensation or see and see a light or
[14:00] something
[14:01] or anything like that that's great
[14:04] the bible said that in the last days the
[14:06] devil will impersonate christianity so
[14:08] close to little deceived the very
[14:10] elected if possible that's right so we
[14:13] must test it and how do we test it by
[14:16] the word you got to test it by going
[14:18] back to the word everything has to be
[14:20] compared back to the word your
[14:21] experience has to be compared back to
[14:23] the word your your new birth has to be
[14:26] compared with the word
[14:28] your journey has to be compared with a
[14:29] word
[14:30] everything has got to be compared with a
[14:32] word we don't believe in just
[14:34] something popping into your head and
[14:35] just running with it we believe in
[14:37] comparing everything back to the word
[14:40] so if we've got if we've got a word
[14:43] that can be compare a message in this
[14:45] day that can be compared back to the
[14:47] word how shall we escaped if we if we
[14:49] neglect so great salvation if we go to
[14:51] the next slide how should we escape
[14:54] and so what is our escape
[14:57] brother abraham said how should we
[14:58] escape if elijah's voice brought
[15:00] destruction because he was an angel of
[15:02] the lord
[15:03] how will we escape when the voice of
[15:05] christ speaking through or how can we
[15:07] fail
[15:08] when you're prayed for if it's the voice
[15:10] of christ
[15:11] and he said where is your escape
[15:14] he said you say bless god i belong to
[15:16] the methodist church i'm a presbyterian
[15:18] i'm a pentecostal that doesn't have one
[15:20] thing to do with it
[15:21] you get on a sideline i want to call it
[15:23] spiritualism or some mental telepathy or
[15:25] some devil or something to shame on them
[15:27] and when we see him come down to confirm
[15:30] his word how shall we escape if we
[15:33] sucker to some church or some
[15:35] organization or denomination or some
[15:37] little pet theory of our own so their
[15:39] way of escape is not in our own ideas or
[15:42] in our little little clicks ideas
[15:44] denominational ideas but it's the
[15:46] revealed word for your day
[15:49] he said you better eternally turn the
[15:50] loose of what turn loose of your own
[15:52] ideas of your own way of thinking
[15:54] for every sin received a just recompense
[15:57] under the angels how much more when the
[15:59] son of god is speaking from the heavens
[16:01] to make manifest his word how shall we
[16:04] escape if we neglect so great a
[16:06] salvation what what what what kind of a
[16:10] salvation is it salvation where we know
[16:11] that christ died on the cross for us
[16:13] that he paid for our sins they made a
[16:15] way for us to be born again that he made
[16:17] a way for us to have the same life of
[16:19] christ in us how should we escape if we
[16:21] neglect a salvation like that
[16:26] you know on the next slide brother
[16:27] graham said
[16:28] there's where all the types and shadows
[16:30] of the old testament all come and met in
[16:32] jesus christ
[16:33] he paid the supreme price
[16:35] ascended on high
[16:37] and sent back the holy ghost tonight
[16:39] which is god's provided way of your
[16:42] escape
[16:43] the way for you to get out
[16:45] the way of escape is the life of god
[16:49] god coming and taking taking a seat on
[16:51] the throne of your heart
[16:54] now
[16:55] when he when he does that when he takes
[16:57] the seat on the throne of your heart he
[16:58] bears witness that's how you know
[17:00] something's happened so paul
[17:02] says in hebrews 2 4 god also bearing
[17:05] them witness and listen to how brother
[17:06] branham
[17:07] you you
[17:08] you're reading this and you've got your
[17:09] mind on the old testament that that god
[17:12] moved through the life of elijah and
[17:13] elisha and all the old testament
[17:15] prophets but now brother brown brings it
[17:17] home that something's got to happen in
[17:19] your life he said god also bearing them
[17:21] witness both with signs and wonders and
[17:23] with diverse miracles and gifts of the
[17:25] holy ghost according to his own will now
[17:28] see he says god always bears witness
[17:31] god always has a way to show that
[17:34] something has taken place and he said
[17:35] your life
[17:36] will bear witness
[17:38] your life bears witness
[17:42] i'm gonna read this real slow
[17:45] i don't know what your testimony is
[17:47] but your life
[17:49] speaks so loud your voice can't be heard
[17:52] now see it's it's it's great we need a
[17:54] revelation of the word but the
[17:56] revelation of the word will produce a
[17:58] life
[17:59] and you know i was thinking this morning
[18:01] coming up uh
[18:04] all right you gotta be careful not to
[18:05] say too much
[18:07] but um
[18:09] you know you see you see things on
[18:11] facebook and and people that people that
[18:13] you thought were christians and things
[18:14] for years and and you know brother brown
[18:16] said things like this people you look at
[18:18] their lives and for years and all of a
[18:19] sudden things come out and
[18:21] they got a woman on the side or
[18:23] something or they're ministers that
[18:24] aren't living right and things your life
[18:27] your life testifies
[18:29] it's a it actually bears witness
[18:32] and how many how many of you sitting
[18:34] here let's use that for an example how
[18:35] many of you sitting here as i speak
[18:37] these words or the brother wade comes
[18:38] out if if you were to look at the
[18:40] minister speaking behind the pool but if
[18:41] you look at their life and recognize
[18:43] that
[18:44] find out that they're cheating on their
[18:45] wife or something or they got something
[18:47] going on in their life they're they're
[18:48] they're sneaking off somewhere to smoke
[18:50] pot or sneaking off and smoking
[18:51] cigarettes then you would begin to lose
[18:53] confidence in that person because their
[18:55] life bears testimony that something is
[18:58] not right your life
[19:00] speaks louder actually than the words
[19:03] that you speak
[19:04] and see i can get up here and i can say
[19:06] things and but but then if i go out and
[19:09] i do something different than the
[19:11] message that i'm preaching my life will
[19:13] actually speak louder than that
[19:17] and he said that's why he said i don't
[19:18] know what your testimony is but your
[19:19] life speaks so loud your voice can't be
[19:22] heard but you're living your everyday
[19:24] life will testify what you are
[19:27] god bears witness now now think about
[19:29] that now talk about think about a
[19:31] witness
[19:32] where the life speaks so loud
[19:34] that your spouse knows
[19:36] i'm married to a real christian
[19:39] that your people at your work know
[19:41] i'm married to a real christian
[19:44] you know a lot of times
[19:45] your wife or your husband
[19:47] knows the things that go they know what
[19:49] your struggles are and they know what
[19:50] problems that you have and everything
[19:52] and if you're if your family knows and
[19:54] recognizes that that's a real christian
[19:57] think about what a testimony that is
[20:00] think about what a witness
[20:02] i believe there's a you know you think
[20:04] about um brother brown when he preached
[20:07] the message paradox he gave that
[20:08] challenge to the to the pentecostal
[20:10] churches and he said show me five people
[20:13] in your church
[20:14] that are signing crying for the
[20:16] abomination done in the city so many
[20:18] five people and he said i'll apologize
[20:20] for what i'm preaching
[20:22] show me five people that have the life
[20:25] the life of christ
[20:27] what kind of life a life where the same
[20:30] virtue the same knowledge and the same
[20:32] temperance that jesus had
[20:35] the same godliness the same brotherly
[20:37] kindness
[20:38] somebody with the same life of christ
[20:41] that will be a testimony
[20:44] now see he said the holy spirit is a
[20:46] seal and a seal takes both sides of the
[20:48] paper
[20:49] now see that's that's where we we
[20:51] stumble a little bit sometimes it's got
[20:53] to be both sides
[20:55] something that god will open up the word
[20:57] to you on the inside and begin to reveal
[21:00] himself
[21:01] but what good does it do if you preach a
[21:03] great sermon like
[21:05] we were talking about
[21:10] what good does it do to preach a great
[21:12] profound sermon and then your life is in
[21:15] shambles
[21:16] what what good does it do if you
[21:19] brother brown said in the message
[21:20] influence if you want to have influence
[21:22] with people make sure you have that
[21:24] heavenly influence first and then people
[21:26] will see
[21:28] you'll be able to influence other people
[21:30] what good does it do if you're preaching
[21:32] a great profound message but you're not
[21:34] living the life so it takes both of
[21:36] those things
[21:38] the word of god revealed on the inside
[21:41] that i know brother brown said in one
[21:42] place the blueprint opened up
[21:44] the blue when you see the blueprint of
[21:47] what you're doing here and your purpose
[21:48] here and what you're supposed to what
[21:50] god's word is doing to you and how it's
[21:52] doing it then then you begin to have
[21:54] confidence that god is doing something
[21:56] but on the outside on the outside other
[21:59] people can recognize in you that
[22:02] something has happened in your life
[22:04] your life is on display
[22:06] he said they see you standing here and
[22:08] see you when you go away not only in
[22:10] church but at everyday work you're
[22:12] sealed on both sides inside and outside
[22:15] by the joy that you have that comes from
[22:17] the faith the revelation that you have
[22:19] that that's what gives you joy and by
[22:21] the life that you live you're sealed in
[22:24] and outside that you know you're saved
[22:27] and the world knows you're saved by the
[22:30] life that you live for god bears witness
[22:32] you know you're saved
[22:34] and the world knows you're saved
[22:36] your wife or your husband know you're
[22:38] saved
[22:39] your family your kids know
[22:42] man my mom and daddy have a real
[22:44] patience
[22:45] what my mama something happens and
[22:48] and they don't fly off the handle but
[22:50] but there's there's a life that i can
[22:52] see
[22:56] let's go to the next slide
[22:58] both with signs and wonders and with
[23:00] diverse miracles and gifts of the holy
[23:02] ghost according to his will
[23:05] brother brown talked about in acts
[23:07] chapter 3 verse 4 he said peter
[23:09] fastening his eyes upon him with john he
[23:10] said brother when the world knows that
[23:12] you've been with jesus when the world
[23:14] knows you've been with jesus
[23:16] when you can live such an unadulterated
[23:18] life in this present world and in this
[23:20] darkness the world knows and can see
[23:23] that you've been with jesus that's what
[23:25] paul is talking about
[23:27] god also bearing them witness
[23:29] with a life when a rugged old vulgar
[23:32] prostitute of the street can become a
[23:34] lady
[23:35] washed in the blood of the lamb god is
[23:38] bearing witness
[23:39] that he lives
[23:41] god's bearing witness when you see the
[23:43] life of christ displayed
[23:45] now where does that come from though it
[23:47] comes from the revelation of god where
[23:49] it comes from you can't put this on by
[23:52] just struggling and trying you can't
[23:54] make yourself live that kind of a life
[23:57] it comes by the word of god received in
[23:59] your heart changing you bit by bit
[24:02] changing you precept upon precept word
[24:04] upon word here they're little they're
[24:06] little until the life of christ is made
[24:08] manifest in your members
[24:11] he said take a drunkard who's so low
[24:12] down that he would run around on his
[24:14] wife that he would mistreat his children
[24:16] and take the food from the table to spin
[24:18] on a prostitute let him get with jesus
[24:20] once
[24:21] you'll see him returning like legion who
[24:23] was in his right mind and clothed
[24:24] through his babies into his wife and to
[24:26] his loved ones you'll see somebody
[24:28] that's changed
[24:31] you know when that when the when the
[24:32] young people get in your car and and
[24:34] you're not playing rock music you're
[24:35] actually listening to the gospel that's
[24:37] a life on display when when they when
[24:39] they recognize when you when you are
[24:41] able to share a testimony that's
[24:43] encouraging that's a life on display and
[24:46] brother brown i'm going to finish on
[24:47] that i got
[24:48] three or four more minutes if if you
[24:50] pull up the next slide
[24:52] he talked about uh this this this
[24:54] minister john witt that he shared this
[24:56] story of this lady mcabee that out in
[24:58] oklahoma that um
[25:02] she got uh this was a long time ago she
[25:04] got to ride in a stagecoach and smoking
[25:05] cigars and doing all kinds of stuff and
[25:07] they ended up tar and feathering her
[25:09] they wanted to tar and feather she was
[25:10] so bad he said they didn't want to touch
[25:12] her and john witt was a was a was a
[25:14] preacher who began to share this
[25:16] testimony when he was overseas and he he
[25:19] put that story out there is there is
[25:21] there any he said gentlemen of the
[25:23] religions of the world is your religion
[25:24] got anything that would clean the hands
[25:26] of lady maccabee is your is your
[25:28] religion got anything that can take this
[25:29] this somebody like this and change their
[25:32] life
[25:33] to where they they're they're a foul
[25:35] individual
[25:36] doing all sorts of
[25:39] of things
[25:41] does your religion have something that
[25:42] will change this person
[25:44] and he said everybody set steel
[25:47] then he clapped his hands together and
[25:48] jumped up in the air he said glory be to
[25:51] god the blood of jesus christ won't only
[25:53] clean her hands
[25:55] but it'll clean her heart and make her
[25:57] his bride
[25:59] i believe in that kind of power in the
[26:01] gospel that see you don't have to sit
[26:04] here and and and say i'm a church member
[26:06] but when you go home and you you go find
[26:08] something naughty to look at on the
[26:10] internet you don't have to there's a
[26:11] power here that can actually change you
[26:14] i'm trying not to start preaching
[26:17] let's read one more and then we'll close
[26:20] uh hebrews chapter 2 verse 4.
[26:22] brother braham said in the lamb and the
[26:24] dove he said it is a new birth and a
[26:26] change of heart that changes a man from
[26:29] a dying being
[26:30] to a resurrected immortal son of god
[26:34] taking his plate on the seat of the
[26:36] believer's heart throwing himself on the
[26:38] father strong
[26:40] it's a nature change
[26:42] a nature change that's what the new
[26:44] birth is a nature change
[26:46] it makes you want to read the bible
[26:48] makes you want to come to church it
[26:49] changes it changes you it does something
[26:51] that you can't do yourself
[26:53] he said is it not true that the
[26:55] musicians can go ahead and come forward
[26:56] is it not true that the bible said the
[26:58] rain falls on the just and unjust
[27:01] the sun shines on the just and unjust
[27:03] you take a wheat field and the little
[27:04] heads are turning over it's a drought
[27:07] and i'm just going to skip down he said
[27:08] the holy spirit falls into a meeting and
[27:10] sometimes the believer and unbeliever
[27:12] worship by the same spirit but the fruit
[27:15] of the spirit proves what you are
[27:17] not the reaction of the spirit not to
[27:20] speak with tongues and not to shout but
[27:22] that goes with it too that all goes with
[27:24] it
[27:24] but unless the fruit of the spirit
[27:27] bears record with god's word
[27:30] you've just got a outward demonstration
[27:33] the fruit of the spirit what's the he
[27:34] said the fruit was your doctrine and
[27:36] when that is on display in your life
[27:40] then you've got a witness
[27:43] god bless you
[27:50] you
