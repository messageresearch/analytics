[0:00] of God the World by wisdom knew not God
[0:04] it pleased God by the foolishness of
[0:06] preaching to save them that believe amen
[0:10] praise the Lord Jesus you have your
[0:12] seats amen we'll just continue reading
[0:15] here me I want to I wanted to read down
[0:18] down all the way to verse 29 I know it's
[0:20] a lengthy scripture
[0:26] but verse 22 for the Jews require a sign
[0:30] and the Greeks seek after wisdom but we
[0:34] preach Christ crucified unto the Jews a
[0:37] stumbling block and unto the Greeks
[0:39] foolishness but unto them which are
[0:41] called both Jews and Greeks Christ the
[0:45] power of God and the wisdom of God
[0:47] because the foolishness of God is wiser
[0:50] than man I've always liked that
[0:52] scripture that that if God had
[0:54] foolishness if he was foolish that
[0:56] foolishness would be wiser than the
[0:59] wisdom of the world Amen but we know God
[1:02] is Not foolish we know that every time
[1:05] when God thinks something amen that is
[1:07] established that is you could just put a
[1:09] period on that that is thus sayith the
[1:11] Lord and that's got to come to pass amen
[1:14] praise God because the foolishness of
[1:16] God is wiser than man and the weakness
[1:18] of God is stronger than man amen for ye
[1:21] see your calling Brethren how that not
[1:25] many wise men after the flesh not many
[1:27] mighty not many noble are called but God
[1:29] ha chosen the foolish things of the
[1:32] world to confound the wise and God hath
[1:36] chosen the weak things of the world to
[1:39] confound the things which are Mighty and
[1:42] base things of the world and things
[1:44] which are despised hath God chosen yay
[1:47] and things which are not to bring to not
[1:50] things that are and this is the reason
[1:53] why that no flesh should glory in his
[1:57] presence amen may the Lord out of
[1:59] blessing to the reading of his word amen
[2:02] praise God I I just want to talk this
[2:04] this evening just a little bit and maybe
[2:08] we might get a little a little
[2:09] technological this this evening but uh
[2:13] you you just bear with me I'm trying to
[2:15] make a point hopefully it'll get
[2:16] somewhere
[2:18] amen but you know I uh we we we work
[2:21] with technology we deal with technology
[2:23] and every every day uh you know it's
[2:25] it's the life of that that we are we are
[2:28] consumed by now days and and so and you
[2:31] know and I got to thinking I got to
[2:34] thinking that that the uh the other
[2:37] night that you know one of the greatest
[2:39] technological things in our day is is is
[2:42] AI artificial intelligence and if you
[2:46] haven't heard about it then um maybe you
[2:49] can get you know get up to speed with it
[2:52] it's definitely not Windows 95 or Doss I
[2:54] could tell you that and it's it's uh
[2:58] those were foundations
[3:00] but uh it's uh it's something uh very
[3:04] Advanced and maybe you older ones may
[3:05] not will not probably understand what
[3:07] we're talking about but uh we are
[3:10] heading into an age where artificial
[3:12] intelligence is is going to be the the
[3:16] dominant thing in our Computing world
[3:18] and in many areas of our life uh you
[3:22] some of you even have artificial
[3:23] intelligence wearing them on your bodies
[3:25] right now if you have smart watches and
[3:27] things like that so um uh is is very
[3:32] prevalent and we see it in our day and
[3:34] and you know I got to thinking that um
[3:37] you know we we think about artificial
[3:39] intelligence and you think about those
[3:41] words artificial intelligence artificial
[3:45] well usually when we think about
[3:46] artificial it's something uh something
[3:49] me you
[3:50] know something uh you know it's it's a
[3:53] love and hate type of thing you know
[3:54] it's something you can have an
[3:56] artificial tooth but it's not nothing
[3:58] like your real tooth
[4:00] you can have an artificial uh you know
[4:03] uh whatever artificial hair but it's not
[4:07] nothing like the hair that you were born
[4:08] with right you know uh that's maybe some
[4:12] of you sisters are or some of you
[4:14] brothers too you
[4:16] know it's not nothing I wish I had my
[4:18] hair back you know and and all that and
[4:21] and and but it's not nothing like the
[4:23] real thing the real deal is always the
[4:26] best right an artificial is always
[4:30] something that gets in between the
[4:33] real and and and you you see it makes
[4:37] you think that it is the real thing
[4:39] that's right right and you live with it
[4:43] and you and you enjoy it but again it
[4:46] comes from the knowledge of the of of
[4:49] the the tree of knowledge of what of
[4:51] Good and Evil right amen you see so it
[4:55] it can't be used for good but it also
[4:58] can be used for evil right but the
[5:00] original Creator amen the one who
[5:03] created heavens and earth the one where
[5:05] natural comes from the one where
[5:07] everything original comes from amen it's
[5:10] always good am it's always good amen
[5:14] praise the Lord Jesus and I'm so glad
[5:16] this evening amen that we serve a good
[5:18] god amen amen I don't know about you but
[5:20] I serve a good God Amen I serve a God
[5:23] Amen who who who is interested in in in
[5:26] in in in my life amen who is interested
[5:28] in what's going on
[5:30] personally and knows everything that
[5:32] personally going on in your life and is
[5:34] interested in it amen we we we can't we
[5:38] sometimes the devil tries to deceive us
[5:40] and let and think makes us think that
[5:42] God is not interested in our life and
[5:44] personally but yet God was the one who
[5:47] created and put you here amen how would
[5:50] he not be interested in what you're
[5:51] going through at this very moment
[5:54] amen because it was God Amen who brought
[5:57] you here praise the Lord Jesus amen and
[6:01] you know we and I was thinking you know
[6:02] we have we've we've elevated this this
[6:05] this uh this artificial intelligence in
[6:08] the last couple of years uh uh as
[6:10] something almost Godlike now and and if
[6:13] we're not careful it will eventually
[6:16] head that way amen and I remember
[6:19] brother brandham he was saying something
[6:21] on the lines of that when they start
[6:23] when they start working in the
[6:24] laboratory of God then he's going to
[6:27] have to step in when they start getting
[6:29] in there and they start uh uh getting in
[6:32] God's laboratory amen that's when he
[6:34] steps in Praise the Lord amen because he
[6:37] knows that it's ultimately going to lead
[6:38] to
[6:39] destruction it will always who is the
[6:42] originator who is the the tree of the
[6:44] knowledge of Good and Evil we know it's
[6:46] nothing but Satan right amen but yet who
[6:49] is the tree of life is Jesus Christ so
[6:53] Satan always he's the author of
[6:55] Destruction he's the author of lies he's
[6:57] the author of of all these things so but
[7:00] yet it starts very very very
[7:03] good and gets you really into it and
[7:07] when you don't know it you have fallen
[7:10] in for it and you're in it and that's
[7:13] the reason why leoa is considered
[7:16] lukewarm because we're like boiling
[7:18] frogs we're like the boiling frog see is
[7:21] like the boiling frog that has been
[7:23] placed in the pot and is boiling slowly
[7:27] slowly slowly until eventually it will
[7:30] be it will be death and that's the
[7:32] reason why but God gave a solution for
[7:34] this day for this age Amen to get get of
[7:37] his eyes have amen praise the Lord he's
[7:40] got eyes have so that you can open your
[7:42] eyes amen and see amen what's going on
[7:44] in the hour that we're living in and we
[7:46] see it through the lens of his word
[7:48] praise the lord we don't have to be
[7:49] blind amen we can see and we can know by
[7:52] the message of the hour Amen in the day
[7:55] the day that we're living in Praise the
[7:57] Lord Jesus so brother Brandon would put
[8:00] it like this he said this he said in the
[8:02] marriage of the lamb in 1962 he said
[8:04] that that's the way the churches are too
[8:06] many today we're just taking the name of
[8:09] the Christian Church pretending to be
[8:12] the bride when it's artificially we're
[8:15] not connected with Christ in any way
[8:18] right amen and I just
[8:20] wonder tonight and I I sincerely ask you
[8:23] this morning this evening amen because
[8:25] the title of of of of my message this
[8:28] evening is human wisdom versus God's
[8:31] wisdom and which one dominates
[8:33] you which one dominates you amen I was
[8:37] going to call I was going to call it AI
[8:40] versus God's C creative intelligence but
[8:44] that I just left it alone when a more
[8:47] spiritual route with it amen but I want
[8:51] I want you to sincerely ask you ask
[8:52] yourself that question amen are you
[8:55] truly connected with
[8:57] Christ amen no I'm not saying I'm not
[9:00] saying are you connected with the church
[9:02] I'm not saying are you connected with
[9:04] just what your experience or I'm not
[9:06] saying are you connected because you
[9:08] knew the message you've known the
[9:09] message for 30 years that's not what I'm
[9:12] talking about are you truly connected
[9:14] amen with the person of Christ this
[9:16] evening amen praise God the life of the
[9:19] life amen the the the creator of all
[9:22] things amen the one amen who can change
[9:24] amen your heart who can change amen when
[9:28] something is going one way in your life
[9:30] amen and when you turn to him amen he
[9:32] can change and turn those things around
[9:34] for you praise God Amen unfortunately we
[9:37] like to just go and go to the artificial
[9:40] thing
[9:41] instead because it feels good and it's
[9:44] the less is the it's the easier route
[9:48] right amen praise the
[9:49] Lord now brother Rand continues to say
[9:52] we're like an artificial we're not
[9:54] connected with Christ in any way we're
[9:56] like an artificial tooth an artificial
[9:58] arm artificial ey see it's something
[10:02] that's artificial if we're just putting
[10:04] it on he says well you can't put on
[10:08] Christianity you've got to be connected
[10:11] with it amen and and there there is a
[10:14] true life that comes out of a true
[10:17] experience with God I believe that with
[10:19] all my heart amen and and the Temptation
[10:23] uh is to be to get lukewarm and to get
[10:27] and to get uh uh uh well I know a lot
[10:30] now and and and I've I'm established now
[10:32] so then I could just put the this on
[10:34] cruise control and and and you see but
[10:37] you don't understand and you don't
[10:39] realize amen that that is leading you to
[10:41] death amen amen praise God you'll be
[10:45] surprised that that day amen the ones
[10:47] who will enter in and the ones who don't
[10:49] enter in we will be surprised I just
[10:53] want to be one of the ones who enter in
[10:54] amen praise God and so this therefore
[10:57] that's why I want to be connected amen
[10:59] to the to that tree of life amen praise
[11:02] the Lord because that's the thing and
[11:04] that's the key that gives us life amen
[11:06] it's this word hallelujah I believe that
[11:09] with all my heart amen so when we when
[11:11] we go back to Genesis chapter 1 and and
[11:14] verse one we we see there that in the
[11:17] beginning God created the heavens and
[11:19] the Earth amen and and and when we look
[11:22] at the word created there or the word
[11:24] Creator the word Creator means
[11:27] originator architect or designer
[11:31] amen an originator he had an original
[11:35] thought spoke it and came to be praise
[11:38] God you were an original thought oh my
[11:41] what a wonderful thing it is to think
[11:42] amen that I was in God's mind amen and
[11:45] he was thinking of me and here I am here
[11:47] on in Earth in order to express him in
[11:49] this hour Amen in this age that you're
[11:52] living in praise God you were placed
[11:53] here to express him not to express
[11:57] yourself amen praise God and so that
[12:01] word means originator architect designer
[12:04] amen and God made man in in in his own
[12:07] image amen uh to be little Gods here on
[12:10] this Earth amen you see we were if he
[12:13] was a Creator then the ones that he
[12:15] created were supposed to be creators as
[12:17] well amen and in one and Jesus Christ
[12:21] told the Pharisees one day then I call
[12:23] you Gods you see in other words we were
[12:26] supposed to cre be creators amen you're
[12:29] the on who creates atmospheres in your
[12:31] lives amen praise God brother Bram said
[12:34] if you you could create worlds and live
[12:37] in them amen if you just realize the
[12:39] power that that that that that that lies
[12:41] within you Amen in this hour amen but
[12:45] sometimes we we we find out that that we
[12:48] bring amen uh
[12:50] atmospheres that are negative to the
[12:53] atmosphere that Christ would bring in in
[12:55] in
[12:57] amen ask yourself
[12:59] sometimes amen when I come in Step into
[13:01] the room what are people thinking what
[13:04] what what kind of atmosphere am I
[13:05] bringing are people pleased to see me
[13:08] there happy to see me there or is it the
[13:12] opposite because you are a
[13:15] Creator and you do create the
[13:17] atmospheres around you that atmospheres
[13:20] that will attract man or that will deter
[13:23] man right amen oh but there it's
[13:27] everybody else's fault amen
[13:31] no it can't be everybody else's fault no
[13:33] no it's got to be something amen what
[13:36] kind of atmosphere are you creating you
[13:38] see and we are we are we are creators in
[13:41] Genesis
[13:42] 1:26 uh God said this and God said let
[13:45] us make man in our image after our
[13:47] likeness and let them have dominion over
[13:50] the fish of the sea and over the foul of
[13:51] the air and over the cattle and over all
[13:54] the Earth and over every creeping thing
[13:56] that creepeth upon the Earth you see so
[14:00] they were to have dominion amen God
[14:02] wanted wanted man to use the uh his
[14:04] creative powers to replenish the Earth
[14:07] Amen to be fruitful and multiply you see
[14:10] a at the beginning and brother Bram
[14:13] spoke about this at the beginning man
[14:15] Adam was supposed to to to speak the
[14:18] word and we were come into existence
[14:21] amen according to those names in the
[14:22] book amen praise God Amen we were
[14:25] supposed to come that way but you see
[14:29] sin came in the picture and that stopped
[14:31] that amen praise God and then Jesus had
[14:33] to come in amen and and defeat and
[14:36] defeat that and come and res and restore
[14:38] that back now we can speak the word amen
[14:41] we can create situations we can create
[14:43] amen he he said speak to that mountain
[14:46] praise
[14:48] God but we have a hard time amen my
[14:51] artificial tooth is hurting or
[14:55] yeah we feel like it's hurting yeah not
[14:58] supposed to hurt because it's
[15:00] artificial and we can't we and we can't
[15:02] heal a
[15:04] toothache we have a hard time just
[15:07] little things like that amen I know it's
[15:10] tough I I I do it too I I run I run to
[15:12] the ointment I run to the doctor I run
[15:14] to the dentist you see thank God for the
[15:16] dentist thank God for the ointment and
[15:19] thank God for the solution amen that
[15:21] that you can rinse your mouth with and
[15:22] it'll help out praise God but originally
[15:26] amen it wasn't so from the
[15:27] beginning you see we were supposed to
[15:30] create we were supposed to be creators
[15:33] amen praise God and you know just like
[15:35] Mary she bore uh Jesus amen God spoke
[15:39] the word Jesus was in Jesus was was was
[15:42] she gave birth to Jesus in that way that
[15:45] was the way that Adam amen was supposed
[15:47] to do at the beginning praise God Amen
[15:49] but Satan of course the who is the tree
[15:52] of knowledge of Good and Evil he came in
[15:54] the picture and perverted that original
[15:57] way amen
[15:59] and so now we we we are in in in the
[16:02] mess that we're in but thank God for
[16:03] Restoration in this hour oh my we have
[16:06] we just thank God Amen that everything
[16:08] that the canker worm ate and everything
[16:10] that the Locust worm ate and everything
[16:12] amen that all those individual worms ate
[16:14] amen but God said I will restore amen
[16:18] you and my you and me couldn't do it
[16:20] amen but than God that God restored it
[16:22] for us praise the Lord Jesus and now we
[16:25] can grow amen into that in Into His
[16:27] Image in this hour amen there's no
[16:29] excuses in this hour Saints Hallelujah
[16:32] there's no excuses amen we have a open
[16:34] book in this hour amen amen amen and we
[16:38] can read from an open book now uh let me
[16:42] just read to you real quick the the what
[16:44] the word artificial uh means and the
[16:47] word the word artificial refers to
[16:49] something that is man-made amen
[16:52] unnatural or not genuine and it comes
[16:55] from the from the Latin AR artificiali
[17:00] meaning made by
[17:02] Art rather than occurring naturally I
[17:06] thought that was very curious amen
[17:09] because when artificial intelligence
[17:11] we've had artificial intelligence now
[17:13] for several years uh however and I guess
[17:17] it really really kicked in and there was
[17:20] a purpose for it they want to get you
[17:22] very nice and cozy with it but they got
[17:24] the real stuff they just giving you the
[17:27] crumbs right now they got the real stuff
[17:31] and and so but Ma you could just if you
[17:35] don't know what it it is you could go to
[17:37] something called chat GTP just kind of
[17:39] briefly explain it to you you can tell
[17:41] chat GTP hey I have this list right here
[17:43] there's this organized of data that I
[17:46] have can you organize all this data for
[17:49] me in a nice column and a and it'll just
[17:52] fix it for you all you do is just give
[17:54] it prompts can you add an image in
[17:56] between this this portion of the data
[17:59] and this of this this that and that
[18:01] it'll just add it right there it'll do
[18:02] it'll do all kinds of nifty little
[18:04] things uh and and whole lot more I'm
[18:08] sure brother Bob knows more than I than
[18:09] I do about it because uh he's done some
[18:12] Nifty Things with it but uh it's very
[18:15] very very interesting amen amen now
[18:18] that's you telling something a machine
[18:20] to do something for you oh my how about
[18:23] you speaking the word in this hour amen
[18:26] amen that's the original amen that's why
[18:29] Jesus said amen speak to this mountain
[18:31] praise God speak to the storm amen speak
[18:34] to the Rain speak to whatever it is
[18:36] that's bothering you in your life amen
[18:39] and you watch God don't come in on the
[18:40] scene amen if you've got faith in this
[18:42] word in this hour if a machine amen a
[18:45] fallen machine amen that came from the
[18:47] knowledge of TR of of Good and Evil from
[18:49] the Tree of knowledge of Good and Evil
[18:51] can obey your command how much more God
[18:53] Amen can he obey your command amen when
[18:56] you when you believe his word amen amen
[18:58] praise God Amen he he said he said ask
[19:01] and you shall receive praise God seek
[19:04] and you shall find amen you want to be
[19:07] like his image just continue to read
[19:09] about his image and you'll become like
[19:10] his image amen praise God Amen it's more
[19:14] Beyond than just giving me a picture of
[19:16] of Jesus Amen praying under a tree or
[19:19] something like that amen praise God you
[19:21] become amen that same life in this hour
[19:24] hallelujah amen and you see it's all it
[19:28] is is the the world copying what the
[19:30] original was amen and and I and is is
[19:34] very curious because they're elevating
[19:36] AI artificial intelligence as something
[19:40] uh you
[19:41] know awesome and wonderful you know
[19:44] whatever that phrase is better than
[19:46] sliced bread or something something like
[19:49] that and and yet it couldn't have
[19:53] happened if there was not an original
[19:55] Creator first an original intelligence
[19:58] first
[19:59] yes you see because there can't be
[20:01] artificial intelligence if there wasn't
[20:03] something real first amen amen but yet
[20:07] it's being elevated as something almost
[20:11] Godlike and if we're not careful amen
[20:13] Our Lives amen we if we Elevate
[20:16] ourselves above the word amen you become
[20:18] God Amen and and what and what you say
[20:22] and what you think is is better than
[20:23] what the word than what the word says
[20:26] and that's Dangerous Ground amen the
[20:28] reason why many people have gone astray
[20:31] have gone with their own ideas and and
[20:33] draw a lot of man behind them and and
[20:36] and following them and and pushing their
[20:37] own ideas and where do we find them now
[20:41] amen in this
[20:43] hour so it's very interesting so that
[20:45] word comes from the Latin art
[20:46] artificiales meaning made by Art rather
[20:49] than occurring naturally um man-made
[20:52] it's man-made it's something that's
[20:53] created by humans rather than occurring
[20:55] naturally like artificial light
[20:57] artificial Turf it's fake or imitation
[21:01] something that mimics the real thing but
[21:03] lacks
[21:06] authenticity it lacks authenticity I
[21:08] want you to remember that word amen
[21:11] artificial flavor or artificial
[21:13] intelligence amen praise God you know
[21:17] I've had some drinks and I've had some
[21:19] food that that my it says if it tastes
[21:21] like strawberry it's got some really
[21:23] strong strawberry
[21:25] taste but it it's not made when you look
[21:28] at the ingredients there's no
[21:29] strawberries in
[21:31] it or anything like that it's artificial
[21:34] it makes you think that it's real and
[21:37] and that's the reason why we accept it
[21:39] that's it because the the the whole
[21:40] point is to make us think that it is and
[21:44] it's the real thing and in reality it's
[21:46] not it came from the
[21:49] original praise God it's superficial or
[21:52] insincere something forced not genuine
[21:56] or lacking real emotion amen that's what
[21:58] the word artificial means amen oh my I I
[22:02] I want to be sincere in this hour amen
[22:05] you know what brother Brandon was told
[22:06] in this when he was said the the angel
[22:09] told him he said if you could just be
[22:11] more sincere amen amen and if if brother
[22:14] Brandon was told that how much more Us
[22:18] in the hour that we're living in we
[22:20] think that we thought brother Brandon
[22:22] was the most sincere man that lived upon
[22:23] this Earth outside of Jesus Christ amen
[22:27] especially in that day when he was still
[22:28] alive with us I just don't know it was
[22:31] so sincere that people even thought that
[22:33] he was Jesus Christ amen how much more
[22:37] us should we be sincere in the hour that
[22:39] we're living in
[22:42] ah so it's it's uh it's the opposite of
[22:46] the opposite of artificial is is natural
[22:48] genuine or authentic amen praise God now
[22:51] now let just read you a couple of quotes
[22:53] I do a lot of reading tonight I been
[22:55] trying not to hoop and holler a lot this
[22:57] this evening
[22:59] but uh we'll see how the Lord leads
[23:02] Amen brother Bram says this remember
[23:04] when he talked about the bogus dollar he
[23:07] said of course we know the devil has
[23:09] patterns and types of everything that
[23:11] God has everything that Satan has is
[23:15] secondarily that he patterned off of God
[23:18] Amen so Satan does not have an original
[23:21] idea or let's better yet uh the the the
[23:24] tree of knowledge of Good and Evil does
[23:26] not have an original idea right praise
[23:29] God it could not have existed if the
[23:31] Tree of Life wasn't there first
[23:33] absolutely amen amen I believe that with
[23:35] all my heart amen every every everything
[23:39] that Satan has is secondarily that he
[23:42] patterned off of God every bogus thing
[23:44] has has something original original to
[23:47] be made off of if there was no real
[23:49] dollar the bogus dollar would be the
[23:52] original in the first you see and as
[23:55] long as there is a bogus only proves
[23:58] that that there is a real one somewhere
[24:01] amen praise God we see all this fakery
[24:04] in this hour amen when and people act
[24:07] fake sometimes and and people uh uh
[24:10] people look fake sometimes just go to
[24:13] Atlanta and you'll see that
[24:15] brother They look fake and then they act
[24:18] fake and they and and and fake fake fake
[24:20] everybody is being comfortable about
[24:22] being fake but amen you don't have to be
[24:25] fake in this hour Saints amen you can
[24:28] really have something genuine young
[24:30] people you can have something real in
[24:32] this hour something true a true genuine
[24:35] experience amen don't settle for fake
[24:37] don't settle for for artificial amen
[24:40] settle for the true word of God in this
[24:42] hour amen something that can change you
[24:45] from the inside out amen that will cause
[24:48] you to be a better a better son or a
[24:50] better daughter or or a better husband
[24:52] or a better wife amen praise God
[24:55] sometimes we feel like you know
[24:58] sometimes that you feel like you're just
[24:59] going through the
[25:00] motions amen and yet you're comfortable
[25:03] with
[25:04] that but something tells you that it
[25:07] shouldn't be that way ah but still I'm
[25:10] going to just keep
[25:11] going and then the next next month comes
[25:15] I I'll I'll I'll I'll change things
[25:17] later you know I I know as long as I'm
[25:19] getting to church as long as I'm doing
[25:21] you know what I'm supposed to do and
[25:23] what everybody sees from the outside
[25:26] that's what's more important to you yeah
[25:29] but God knows you have a heart
[25:31] problem and you know that God knows you
[25:34] have a heart
[25:36] problem so that's where that's where we
[25:39] want to look to the real real amen come
[25:41] back to the original come back to where
[25:44] you left Christ amen wherever you left
[25:47] him that's where you're going to find
[25:48] him sir amen that's what brother
[25:50] brandham said amen if he's there waiting
[25:52] for you then just come back to him he
[25:55] didn't leave you you left him amen amen
[25:58] praise God and as long as there is a
[26:01] bogus only proves that there is a real
[26:03] one somewhere amen a real one so so when
[26:07] you see something the devil is doing
[26:09] remember God has got something far
[26:12] beyond that amen that he's trying to
[26:15] impersonate here but Jesus said by their
[26:18] fruits you shall know them amen in
[26:20] another message brother bam said and now
[26:22] he promised to do that again the son of
[26:24] man would reveal himself like he did at
[26:26] Sodom the world is in that condition the
[26:28] church is in that condition now now has
[26:31] God kept his word amen I'll will ask you
[26:34] that brother B's asking that question
[26:36] how has God kept his word has God kept
[26:38] his word in your life amen amen that why
[26:40] settle for something fake when you can
[26:42] have something real amen when you can
[26:44] have a a real life genuine life in this
[26:47] hour now with this I am not saying that
[26:50] stop going to chat GTP and stop using
[26:52] things that have to do with AI I'm not
[26:54] telling you that that's not what I'm
[26:56] saying that that that's between between
[26:58] you and God however I I I use Ai and
[27:01] everything that's integrated in in the
[27:03] day that we're living in amen it's
[27:04] becoming more to that that's a
[27:06] technology that that even cars are using
[27:08] that now so that they could track you a
[27:11] little bit I mean but anyways um that's
[27:14] right and so that that that that that
[27:16] technology is there you see and we can't
[27:19] get away from it but you see you have to
[27:22] you have to know how to balance things
[27:23] in your life amen praise God now has God
[27:27] kept his word see he has or not oh we've
[27:29] had signs jumping speaking in tongues
[27:32] prophecy so forth but wait there's
[27:33] another sign he said amen uh oh we have
[27:37] many carnal impersonations that just
[27:39] makes the real one shine amen amen any
[27:43] bogus dollars should have should make
[27:46] the real one shine praise God amen amen
[27:50] you know you know I've I've been to
[27:52] meetings and I just be real we're just
[27:54] family here right I've been to meetings
[27:57] and you can kind of tell you know sister
[27:59] gets up dancing or shouting or something
[28:02] like that and and and I I told my wife
[28:05] you know what praise the Lord but I
[28:07] could you could kind of tell that's just
[28:09] put on you know right I don't know I
[28:12] just have I don't know that's just
[28:13] something that God's given me and I
[28:15] could just kind of spot a fake when you
[28:17] when you see when you see it I don't
[28:18] know but I'm going tell you what I'll
[28:21] tell you what Sunday when I was in there
[28:24] brother brother Aaron was up here
[28:25] getting happy I could tell that was
[28:27] something genuine
[28:30] amen praise
[28:33] God hey the spirit of the Lord moves
[28:35] upon my heart I will dance like David
[28:38] dance as the song said amen praise the
[28:40] Lord Jesus and that's exactly what
[28:42] brother Aaron did so we appreciate that
[28:44] amen praise the Lord but when when and
[28:48] so uh we need more of that sometimes you
[28:51] know you to truly honestly get happy
[28:53] before the before God because he's made
[28:56] us happy amen amen we are supposed to be
[28:58] happy people amen amen we're supposed to
[29:01] be happy people in this hour so that
[29:03] just makes a real one shine see the fake
[29:06] the fake thing see the fake Christian
[29:09] just makes the real Christian shine and
[29:12] so that's the reason why you need it you
[29:14] need the fake Christian to be there in
[29:16] order for the real one to shine right
[29:19] you see brother brandom said that you
[29:22] you won't know a good woman unless
[29:24] there's a bad one you see or a good man
[29:27] in order there's a bad man you see so
[29:30] you need these opposites amen for to be
[29:33] there amen you need negative and
[29:34] positive in order to make a to to for
[29:36] something to show amen amen now I want
[29:39] to ask you this question do you have
[29:41] that Mark of authenticity in your
[29:44] life all right I told you to remember
[29:46] that word do you carry that Mark of
[29:50] authenticity amen authenticity means
[29:52] something
[29:53] authentic something real something
[29:56] original amen amen amen for example if
[29:59] you if you wear Rolex
[30:02] watches I don't yeah can't afford them
[30:07] they are nice but a brother one time
[30:10] gave me uh and I actually have it in my
[30:12] house a fake Rolex
[30:16] watch my my wife knows who it
[30:20] was he's not with us anymore yeah
[30:25] but and this and it's it was It was
[30:28] supposed to mimic that that style of
[30:30] watch you know like I think he told me
[30:34] this is what he told me he said it
[30:36] doesn't hold a it doesn't hold a battery
[30:38] it moves or something with the with like
[30:40] the pulse of your uh your pulse and it
[30:43] moves or something like that I like wow
[30:45] that's awesome and this is this is a
[30:49] flex yeah even the folx was doing
[30:53] [Laughter]
[30:56] that wow wow so it did it ran for maybe
[31:02] a year or two two years and now it's
[31:04] sitting in my closet and it's not
[31:06] running
[31:09] anymore why because it's not
[31:12] authentic it looked just like a Rolex
[31:15] but it was a
[31:17] flex and it's not working now and now
[31:20] even the little the little uh the little
[31:22] areas little lines where where the hour
[31:25] and the minutes are you know they're
[31:26] falling off and and so it's it's almost
[31:29] like that little game where the where
[31:30] the in the water where the little Hoops
[31:32] are coming that's how my watch that's
[31:34] how my watch is now I can shake it and I
[31:36] can hear it and it's supposed to be a
[31:40] Rolex my
[31:42] goodness but you see it's fake amen and
[31:45] when something is fake eventually it'll
[31:48] fall when something is not real
[31:51] eventually it will show its true
[31:53] colors amen you see so not cops am man
[31:58] fake Rolexes they or true Rolexes they
[32:01] come with a certificate of
[32:03] authenticity right man you pay all that
[32:06] money you going to get a you going you
[32:08] want to get a real thing they come with
[32:10] a certificate a serial number and a high
[32:13] and high quality craftsmanship but a
[32:16] knockoff a fake Rolex or a flex may look
[32:20] identical but lacks pres Precision
[32:23] durability and the official verification
[32:26] from Rolex right right and eventually it
[32:30] won't last as long so you want to look
[32:32] like amen the real thing but eventually
[32:36] you're going to either have to buy a
[32:37] real Rolex or buy another
[32:41] Flex cuz yours ain't going to last that
[32:44] long Heen sneakers are the same you know
[32:47] Nike or Adidas shoes have specific
[32:49] designs details uh unique barcodes and
[32:53] and official
[32:55] packaging fake versions May copy that
[32:57] Des design but but are sub but are made
[33:00] of subpar materials and lack the comfort
[33:03] and com and and durability so they won't
[33:05] last this long you see right see I I had
[33:09] I had a a pair of shoes that looked
[33:12] almost just like
[33:13] Jordans like the original Jordans back
[33:15] from the 1980s late 80s and I used to
[33:19] like playing basketball a lot so I knew
[33:21] about Jordans and shoes and things like
[33:23] that I had them sitting in my in my
[33:26] basement the other day and I went out I
[33:28] used them to go walking to go walking
[33:30] outs out in the backyard and everything
[33:32] I put them on and and and and the whole
[33:35] bottom just fell off of as I was
[33:37] walking I said I know these ain't
[33:41] Jordans you see so again that just goes
[33:44] to prove amen how important it is for
[33:46] your life to be something genuine amen
[33:49] because how many people have we've seen
[33:51] fallen in the hour that we're living in
[33:54] in the last several years that we've
[33:55] been people have in who we thought that
[33:59] were just so genuine Christians and we
[34:02] just thought that they they you know
[34:05] everything was going so good for them
[34:07] and now where are they
[34:09] at my and you see so it's it it pays to
[34:14] know amen if you have the goods or if
[34:16] you don't have the goods am I truly a
[34:19] Christian or am I just somebody who just
[34:21] gives lip service do I really know this
[34:24] word the way I'm supposed to know or do
[34:27] I just or or or am I ashamed of it amen
[34:31] Paul said I'm not ashamed of the Gospel
[34:33] amen for is the power of the Salvation
[34:35] amen praise
[34:37] God hallelujah now in Matthew 7 I I told
[34:42] you we just read a little bit but Jesus
[34:44] says this he says be in Matthew 7:15 he
[34:46] says beware of false prophets which come
[34:49] to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly
[34:52] they are ravening clo wolves you know in
[34:54] the hour that we're living in we're
[34:55] supposed to have we're Christians
[34:57] supposed to be Discerning amen amen
[35:00] that's part of that that discernment is
[35:02] part one of the gifts amen but we all
[35:05] have amen a a a uh we all have a little
[35:08] bit of discernment amen praise God we
[35:11] should at least and with the Holy Ghost
[35:13] amen God has given us even more amen and
[35:16] then there's some that have that gift of
[35:18] discernment you see praise God so we
[35:21] should be be Discerning in this hour
[35:23] which come to you in sheep's clothing
[35:25] but inwardly they are ravening wolves
[35:28] amen right Jesus says this ye shall know
[35:30] them by their fruits Amen in other words
[35:34] what they produce in their life if they
[35:37] say one thing and and and it doesn't
[35:40] produce what what they are saying or
[35:42] what is in this word amen that you don't
[35:45] have to listen to
[35:47] them oh that sounds strong you don't
[35:50] have to obey them that's right amen
[35:53] Jesus says do men gather Grapes of
[35:55] thorns or figs of of thistle
[35:58] in other words do you get grapes from
[36:00] from uh Thorns or or figs from thistles
[36:05] verse 17 he says even so every good tree
[36:08] bringeth forth good fruit amen praise
[36:11] God and and and let's just look at the
[36:13] life of brother Brandon amen that that
[36:16] man everything he preached brought me
[36:17] back to Christ amen I don't care what
[36:20] people say I don't care what people say
[36:22] about that cloud I don't care what
[36:24] people say about anything everything
[36:25] that word that he preached didn't never
[36:28] take me to him it always took me to
[36:30] Christ amen praise God Amen you
[36:34] see but then you you bring other
[36:37] preachers and other people that have
[36:38] come on the scene amen if they're
[36:40] pulling you to themselves amen then
[36:43] they're preaching another gospel and
[36:45] they're not preaching the original
[36:47] they're not preaching the genuine the
[36:49] it's artificial what they're bringing
[36:51] amen amen even so every good tree
[36:54] bringeth forth good fruit but a corrupt
[36:56] tree bringeth forth evil fruit a good
[36:58] tree cannot bring forth evil fruit
[37:01] neither can a corrupt tree bring forth
[37:02] good fruit every tree that bringeth not
[37:06] forth good fruit is heun down or in
[37:08] other words cut down and it's cast Into
[37:10] the Fire amen wherefore Jesus said this
[37:13] wherefore by their fruits you shall know
[37:16] them amen so be Discerning in this hour
[37:21] that we're living in amen praise God
[37:23] right do not get caught up amen but with
[37:27] with with with with personalities amen
[37:30] but be Discerning discern in this hour
[37:33] amen what's the intention what's the
[37:36] what's the agenda what's the idea behind
[37:38] what's being said what's being done
[37:40] what's what's going on Amen discern amen
[37:43] and use the word as the foundation use
[37:46] the prophet's message amen as a guide
[37:48] amen right the thing is we don't
[37:50] understand the message amen and we don't
[37:52] use brother Brenham already said amen
[37:54] what's going to happen Amen in the in
[37:56] later years to come amen
[37:58] right praise God this thing's got to go
[38:00] back to Mama Rome y amen as sure as thus
[38:04] sayth the Lord is amen so be Discerning
[38:08] of what's going on in the hour that
[38:09] we're living in that you not fall amen
[38:12] into harah harah harah amen and forget
[38:16] what the word of God is
[38:17] saying because it's so easy Amen to just
[38:20] fall into the the the the the motions
[38:23] and and and to the uh uh where everybody
[38:26] is going Y and you're not realizing amen
[38:29] this is taking me away further from God
[38:32] God is trying to strike take us back
[38:34] brother brandom said that the Angels now
[38:36] are trying to run us to the tree of life
[38:39] amen back to him back to the tree of
[38:42] life amen we're letting other things
[38:45] around us amen drawing us away from that
[38:48] amen right be Discerning in this hour I
[38:51] beg of you and I I believe that in the
[38:53] hour in in the next next several years
[38:56] amen you're going to hear that that word
[38:57] even more amen discern discern
[39:02] discern
[39:03] amen praise
[39:05] God now watch what SEC Paul says in 2
[39:08] Corinthians amen remember our we want
[39:11] the original we want we don't want fake
[39:13] we want the original amen right I'm try
[39:15] to move a little quicker now but I will
[39:17] continue this is Paul speaking and I'm
[39:19] reading from the New Living Translation
[39:21] so that you can understand it a little
[39:22] better but I will continue doing what I
[39:25] have always done this is Paul speaking
[39:27] this will undercut those who are looking
[39:29] for an opportunity to boast that their
[39:32] work is just like
[39:33] ours these people are false Apostles
[39:38] they are deceitful workers who disguise
[39:40] themselves as Apostles of Christ but I
[39:43] am not surprised Paul says even Satan
[39:46] disguises himself as an angel of Light
[39:50] amen so it is no wonder that his
[39:53] servants also disguise themselves as
[39:55] Servants of righteousness MH in the end
[39:58] they will get the punishment their
[40:00] wicked Deeds deserve
[40:02] amen so we see that Satan can also be he
[40:06] he he can look so genuine so real so so
[40:10] good and so he's an he what did he say
[40:14] Satan disguises himself as an angel of
[40:17] Amen of darkness
[40:19] no no an angel of Light amen and what is
[40:22] God God is light amen and in him is no
[40:26] Darkness at all right but you see Satan
[40:29] can show come to you in that way but yet
[40:31] there will be Darkness within
[40:33] him just like them Pharisees Dead Man's
[40:36] bones inside even though they were
[40:38] showing absolutely right light on the
[40:42] outside you see so it's fakery and in
[40:45] the end fakery has to go out has to be
[40:48] thrown away has to be has to be taken
[40:51] down has will eventually
[40:53] fall and now we're living in an hour in
[40:56] this hour amen is fake fake
[40:59] fake I would I I I would I would I I
[41:02] would just caution you amen everything
[41:05] that you see in the media amen please be
[41:09] Discerning amen there is more
[41:12] psychological things happening right now
[41:14] in this hour that you're living in you
[41:15] don't
[41:17] realize do not take it for for for for
[41:21] face value otherwise you'll be deceived
[41:24] amen oh but I know the message I can't
[41:27] be deceived but is that message in you
[41:29] that's right the message is Christ amen
[41:32] the Christ should be in you and in
[41:34] Christ amen a true experience with
[41:36] Christ amen will cause you to be
[41:38] Discerning amen amen it's okay to
[41:41] support you know and and all that that's
[41:43] okay pray for your leaders and all that
[41:45] that's that's good that that you know
[41:47] Paul talked about that amen but he he
[41:50] said to be
[41:52] established be
[41:55] established amen you're Le leaders one
[41:57] day will come to these doors and they
[41:59] will padlock these doors that's right
[42:02] where will you stand that with your
[42:05] leaders no you got to make a stand at
[42:08] some point amen I'm just being real with
[42:11] you
[42:14] amen now earlier in that chapter Paul
[42:17] said this he said earlier uh he said
[42:19] this I hope you will put up with a
[42:21] little more of my foolishness he said
[42:23] please bear with me and I'm reading from
[42:26] the new l transl for I am jealous for
[42:28] you with the jealousy of God himself I
[42:30] promised you as a pure bride to one
[42:33] husband amen which is Christ but I fear
[42:37] that somehow your pure and undivided
[42:39] Devotion to Christ will be corrupted now
[42:44] he he's talking to the Corinthians back
[42:46] that at that time and history is
[42:49] repeating itself
[42:51] now just as Eve was deceived by the
[42:54] cunning ways of the serpent
[42:57] he's talking to Christians here he's not
[42:59] talking to the drunk man or the or the
[43:01] prostitute outside he's talking to
[43:02] Christians you happily put up with
[43:05] whatever anyone tells you Paul
[43:07] says even if they preach a different
[43:10] Jesus than what than than the one we
[43:12] preach or a different kind of spirit
[43:15] than the one you received or a different
[43:16] kind of gospel than the one you
[43:19] believed
[43:20] right so he's I I I I wanted to read
[43:24] that
[43:25] because all this start started from
[43:27] Genesis chapter 3 amen the knowledge of
[43:30] good the tree of knowledge of Good and
[43:32] Evil and and and when you read there it
[43:33] says and when the woman saw that the
[43:35] tree was good for food and that it was
[43:37] pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be
[43:40] desired to make one wise she took of the
[43:42] fruit thereof and did eat and gave also
[43:45] unto her husband with her and he did eat
[43:48] and the eyes of them both were open and
[43:51] they knew that they were naked and they
[43:54] sewed fig leaves together and made
[43:56] themselves aprons now I want you to take
[43:59] a look at the context here because when
[44:01] they were deceived when Eve was deceived
[44:04] she gave to her husband her husband and
[44:08] her partook and then now what is the
[44:10] consequence of that now what are they
[44:12] doing they add they put something on
[44:15] themselves a fig leaf fig Leaf religion
[44:19] to cover up right the original that God
[44:23] had given them in other words they were
[44:26] using religion something fake something
[44:28] that wasn't that that wasn't original
[44:31] amen for and now they were going to live
[44:33] this way right and you see and God has
[44:36] not called us Amen to that amen praise
[44:39] God you be careful in your life Saints
[44:42] amen what you are using in your life to
[44:44] cover your life with amen praise God if
[44:47] it's not the word of God Amen if it's
[44:49] not amen a genuine experience with God
[44:52] then leave it alone amen we want to be
[44:55] covered with the real amen not fig
[44:57] leaves amen I'm afraid some a lot of us
[45:01] we we we act amen and live by fig Leaf
[45:04] religion y amen
[45:08] amen praise
[45:11] God be careful amen that that you're not
[45:13] just covering your life with spiritual
[45:15] fig leaves but that you truly have the
[45:18] baptism of the Holy Ghost in your soul
[45:21] amen amen the the because the Pharisees
[45:24] they were covering their spiritual death
[45:26] with religion yeah right right and so
[45:28] that's that's that's the that's the
[45:30] that's the trap in this hour because
[45:33] remember in justification amen when you
[45:36] ask when you're Justified amen you you
[45:39] past sins are chopped off right you
[45:41] repent of your sins and they're chopped
[45:43] off now you're entering into a stage of
[45:45] sanctification right amen where you're
[45:47] letting aside amen all the you're
[45:50] dropping things of the world Amen and
[45:52] forgetting smoking and drinking and
[45:54] gambling and and all those things you're
[45:57] trying to you're seeing that those bad
[46:00] habits are not good for you they're not
[46:02] good for your family they're not good
[46:03] for for the church they're not good so
[46:05] you're letting those things go but you
[46:07] let go of all those things and you're
[46:09] not doing them anymore and when we don't
[46:11] continue that is the Trap right there
[46:14] because now you got
[46:16] religion and religion is good but
[46:20] religion is dangerous at the same
[46:22] time amen because you can think I've got
[46:26] it I've done I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm
[46:28] where I need to be I've let go of these
[46:30] things I don't do them anymore I
[46:32] genuinely do not smoke anymore I
[46:34] genuinely do not do these things anymore
[46:38] these bad
[46:39] habits and you stay right
[46:42] there and then you don't go further on
[46:45] into the baptism to a genuine experience
[46:47] with Christ where his life is in you and
[46:50] you're W you're in him and he's in you
[46:53] then that's a trap you're you're you're
[46:54] living just like Judas yes sir
[46:57] because Judas got to justification and
[47:00] sanctification but did not go to the
[47:02] baptism of the Holy Ghost and what ended
[47:05] up happening he was a fake yes he was
[47:07] artificial yes right and what ended up
[47:11] happening to his artificial life around
[47:14] Jesus and around and around the
[47:16] disciples around the disciples and
[47:18] around everybody he was just a good
[47:21] Treasurer did not break anything amen
[47:25] he's he had his hair parted really well
[47:27] and I mean he was he was I mean probably
[47:30] the best looking one maybe in in amongst
[47:33] him you know amongst the disciples he I
[47:35] mean he he wore he wore nice smelling
[47:38] cologne and and all that I mean he was
[47:41] probably and I mean he was a good
[47:43] accountant I'm just brother
[47:46] [Laughter]
[47:49] John I mean he was he was the sharpest
[47:52] guy out all
[47:54] of and Peter the one who was foul mouth
[47:58] and he had a bad temper and and uh but
[48:01] but yet God was the one deal Jesus was
[48:04] the one dealing with Peter the most amen
[48:07] because he knew that amen that out of
[48:09] that I can make something out of that
[48:11] amen amen because that's
[48:14] real Peter was just being real you see
[48:18] Peter was just being himself but but but
[48:21] Judas was a fake Judas was
[48:24] artificial amen right and eventually he
[48:26] showed his true colors and what happened
[48:28] to him he went and hung
[48:30] himself what happens to everything
[48:32] artificial it has to die amen amen amen
[48:36] right it has to die and eventually it
[48:38] shows its true
[48:40] colors you see so
[48:43] sanctification I just want to reiterate
[48:45] that point and we'll almost be done here
[48:48] uh sanctification is a very dangerous
[48:50] point to you for you to be
[48:53] in make sure that you have the goods
[48:56] amen make sure that you're full uh
[48:59] genuinely uh full of the Holy Ghost amen
[49:02] praise God because we can be covering
[49:05] ourselves up with the Fig leaves of
[49:07] religion that's right I go to church I
[49:10] read my Bible I I I pray I I do these
[49:14] things amen but you can't discern the
[49:17] word you don't have Revelation and when
[49:20] somebody asks you about what does the
[49:22] word say about this what do you don't
[49:24] know what to tell them that means you
[49:26] don't have a relationship with the
[49:28] word amen I know I say that all the time
[49:32] but it's very shameful amen that you
[49:35] have to call your pastor up for to
[49:37] explain to someone what water baptism in
[49:39] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ is you
[49:42] should know that for yourself amen you
[49:44] should be able to tell people about it
[49:46] yes sir
[49:49] amen so it's very important in this hour
[49:51] that you become one see Judas was around
[49:53] the disciples they didn't know that he
[49:55] was that way but but the life the tree
[49:57] of life that was there he
[49:59] knew Jesus knew who he was amen praise
[50:02] God
[50:04] so just real quick
[50:08] amen and thinking about artificial amen
[50:10] and Ai and this hour that we're living
[50:13] in uh if we're over Reliant upon AI it
[50:16] can weaken our critical thinking our
[50:18] creativity and and personal
[50:21] responsibility and it and it leads us to
[50:24] intellectual stagnation
[50:26] if if our life is totally relyant you
[50:29] know it reminds me of of if you ever
[50:31] seen that movie Wall-E have you ever
[50:33] seen that movie Wall-E it's a Disney
[50:35] movie A Pixar movie that came out back
[50:37] in
[50:39] 2012 go Google it if you don't if you
[50:41] don't know what I'm talking about but
[50:43] anyways in that
[50:45] movie everybody was living here on Earth
[50:47] but then eventually supposedly they went
[50:49] up to space and everybody with the the
[50:51] the the the everybody was going to live
[50:53] in space and the humans didn't have have
[50:56] to do anything else anymore the robots
[50:59] were going to do everything for
[51:01] them yeah and then life was so good and
[51:05] everything was so amazing and and you
[51:07] saw the humans they were riding around
[51:09] in chairs around and they were floating
[51:11] around and and the and the and the uh
[51:14] robots would come and do pedicures for
[51:16] them and all kinds of things you see
[51:18] seemed like a good
[51:20] life but they were in that life they
[51:23] were becoming very very unhealthy right
[51:26] they were gaining weight they were they
[51:28] were they were they were getting sick
[51:30] they stopped realizing amen what they
[51:32] didn't even recognize what Earth was
[51:35] anymore like what actual dirt was trees
[51:38] they were they were forgetting all these
[51:40] things because of what they were
[51:43] originally supposed to be because they
[51:46] have let they had let robots and things
[51:48] and other things take over you see right
[51:51] so if we're not careful am man that's
[51:53] exactly I don't know what's going to
[51:54] happen in several in the next 10 15
[51:57] years if we're still here amen that's
[51:59] eventually that's probably where this
[52:01] thing is going to be heading amen at
[52:03] least that's what they want it to be
[52:06] that's their idea for us to
[52:08] merge with with with with with robots
[52:11] and things like that amen but there's a
[52:13] loss of critical thinking diminished
[52:15] creativity erosion of personal
[52:17] responsibility and and dependence on
[52:20] artificial wisdom amen so let's take
[52:23] that and put it in the in the spiritual
[52:24] amen over Reliance on on your fig Leaf
[52:27] religion amen it will weaken your
[52:29] critical thinking about about your own
[52:31] life amen praise God and the things you
[52:35] do and the things you say Amen in
[52:37] Proverbs 3:5 it tells us this that trust
[52:39] in the Lord with all thine heart and
[52:41] lean not unto thine own understanding
[52:45] amen and that's what the Bible says
[52:47] don't trust your own heart your own
[52:48] heart is deceitful amen amen trust in
[52:51] the Lord with all thine heart and lean
[52:54] not unto thy own understanding amen
[52:57] all right so if over Reliance Amen on on
[53:00] on on natural uh on artificial
[53:03] intelligence does these things then in
[53:06] the spiritual over Reliance on your fig
[53:09] Leaf religion will also weaken your
[53:12] creativity for
[53:14] God uh which was created for you to be a
[53:17] little Creator here on Earth to create
[53:20] atmospheres amen
[53:23] amen the weakening of your spiritual
[53:26] creat ity diminishes the work you can do
[53:28] for the benefit of others amen praise
[53:32] God right so creativity see we were
[53:35] original We were originally supposed to
[53:36] be creators amen and and in Exodus 35:30
[53:40] there was a there was a story there uh
[53:42] you can read it on your own but it says
[53:44] this God filled bazel on o and ohav with
[53:48] his spirit amen with God's spirit giving
[53:51] them wisdom understanding and artistic
[53:54] ability to design the Tabernacle
[53:57] amen of Moses you see because they were
[54:00] in tune with with with the word of the
[54:03] hour of that day you see and so make
[54:06] sure that you are in tune with the with
[54:08] with the word of of the hour amen with
[54:11] the word
[54:13] amen and then over Reliance on you now
[54:16] when I say fig Leaf religion is relying
[54:18] upon you upon what you can do you see
[54:20] over Reliance on your fig Leaf religion
[54:22] it will weaken it weakens causes you to
[54:26] not own up to your own mistakes right
[54:29] and to always think you you are always
[54:33] right and the Pharisees always thought
[54:35] they were right amen that's right and
[54:38] Jesus told them in Luke chapter 18 uh
[54:41] when he gave that Parable he said there
[54:43] was a parable of a man praying one time
[54:45] and and he went to the temple to pray
[54:47] and he was a Pharisee and the other
[54:50] person that was next to him praying was
[54:52] a Publican and this is what the
[54:54] Pharisees prayer was he said he stood
[54:56] and prayed thus with him himself God I
[54:58] thank thee that I am not as other
[55:01] men extortioners unjust adulterers or
[55:05] even as this Publican
[55:07] here amen I fast twice in the week I
[55:11] give tithes of all that I
[55:13] possess you cannot truly say that that
[55:16] he had the spirit of Christ right Christ
[55:19] is not selfish Christ is not
[55:22] self-centered
[55:24] amen and the Publican stand standing a
[55:26] far off the publicans who was always
[55:28] turned down amen standing AAR off would
[55:31] not lift up so much as his eyes unto
[55:33] heaven but smoted upon his breast saying
[55:36] God be merciful to me a
[55:38] sinner and I tell you Jesus saying I
[55:41] tell you this man went down to his house
[55:43] Justified rather than the other for
[55:46] everyone that exalteth himself shall be
[55:49] abased and he that humbleth himself
[55:52] shall be exalted amen amen Paul says in
[55:55] 1 Corinthians just reading here real
[55:57] quick 8 1-3 now regarding your question
[56:00] about food that has been offered to
[56:02] Idols yes we know that we all have
[56:04] knowledge about this issue but while
[56:07] knowledge makes us feel important it is
[56:09] love that strengthens the church amen
[56:11] I'm just reading in the New Living
[56:13] Translation knowledge makes us feel
[56:15] important and that's what artificial
[56:16] intelligence gives us is knowledge makes
[56:19] us feel like you know
[56:20] something right but he says knowledge
[56:22] puffeth up right anyone who claims to
[56:26] know all the answers doesn't really know
[56:29] very much Paul says in verse two amen
[56:32] but the person who loves God is the one
[56:34] whom God recognizes amen amen
[56:38] amen I'll finish with with with this
[56:41] I'll have the muss come do you remember
[56:44] you remember that story that brother
[56:45] brandham told about about that man who
[56:48] who went up and to speak at in Chicago I
[56:51] believe it was and and uh and he said
[56:55] that that that man was there to blast
[56:57] you know brother brandham and to blast
[56:59] all the ministers there that that they
[57:01] were of the Full Gospel businessmen and
[57:04] all that and and uh and and he said he
[57:08] went up there and he was and and he
[57:10] would just I'll just read it the way
[57:12] brother Brandon say he says and when he
[57:14] did he had everything wrote out in a
[57:16] book about like that and I'm sure
[57:18] brother Brandon was was maybe saying it
[57:20] was a thick book an intellectual sermon
[57:23] you couldn't have heard a better one but
[57:25] he found out when speaking it it didn't
[57:28] go with Full Gospel people that
[57:31] intellectual ideas he comes stomping up
[57:33] there with his chest out and throwed it
[57:36] out and he even made fun of them and
[57:39] everything but when he did he found out
[57:42] it didn't go so good so he found out he
[57:45] was wrong he closed up his books and
[57:48] walked down with his shoulders down
[57:50] humbly walking
[57:52] down and then there was an Old Saint
[57:54] sitting over a corner
[57:56] punched the one next to him and said if
[58:00] if he would have if he would have went
[58:02] up the way he came
[58:03] down he would have come down the way he
[58:06] went
[58:09] upen if he would have went up to the
[58:13] podium the way he came down he would
[58:16] have come down the way he went up
[58:18] amen he would have come down the way he
[58:20] went up so that's about right brother
[58:22] Brown says so it's so important this Sor
[58:26] Amen to be humble Amen to be be be
[58:30] humble amen have
[58:33] humility amen doesn't matter what you
[58:36] know
[58:38] amen I'm trying to I I I I take it more
[58:41] now more if somebody doesn't ask me then
[58:43] I don't need to offer them my my
[58:46] opinion most of the time most people
[58:48] don't care about your opinion yeah but
[58:51] if they really want to know they'll ask
[58:53] you that's right
[58:56] right and so and so it's important in
[59:00] this hour Amen to know amen do you want
[59:03] something artificial or do you want or
[59:06] you going to stick with the real I want
[59:07] to stick with the real amen the real
[59:09] always survives the real always amen
[59:13] humbles himself the real will take me
[59:16] back to the original amen the fake will
[59:19] always pass away amen amen God's word
[59:23] never pass away praise the Lord Jesus
[59:25] let's stand to our feet
