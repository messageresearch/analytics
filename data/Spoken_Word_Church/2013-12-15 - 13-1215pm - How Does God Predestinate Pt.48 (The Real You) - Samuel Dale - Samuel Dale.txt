getting on to the playing that was beautiful all of it's beautiful I appreciate it amen good to see everybody in the house of the Lord if you'd like to turn back in your scriptures turn where we was reading this morning from Romans 8 and Ezekiel 18 just remember the announcements that they will not be able to service here on December the 25th because that's on Wednesday and then we will be having a watch Night Service on Tuesday which is the 31st and then there will not be any Services here on the first day of January which would be the Wednesday because we' be so close in there with the time so just remember that remember each one remember sisters if you want to bring some stuff for finger food where we can eat and fellowship together and come a little early and we generally get here in the afternoon we start at 8:00 but we generally get here in the afternoon and you know and have a little time together and fellowship and too uh make sure you get you up a special because brother might not preach that long I don't know how long he does preach but we always you know have it early and get started and then that way we can have singing testimony meeting or whatever you want to have give a little testimony or whatever if you got it then be ready to give it there on the watch Night Service okay just remember these things I think that's all remember Wade's up at brother Tom kain's and probably through on the way back home by now so remember them traveling to the mountains there okay Romans 8 and Ezekiel 18 father we thank you for the grace and love that you have bestowed upon us to be able to say that we are the children of God what a great opportunity world a world of Christianity confesses that today but really is it a truth from their heart or is it that their mouth is just saying it and and their actions and reactions is hypocritical in that they're not doing it then then that would be a split condition Lord as we were reading or talking about this morning and father we don't want to be a hypocrite we want to be what you want us to be we ask you to just forgive our sins and guide us in your grace keep each and every one of us Lord remember the sick among us reach down and touch each one father because we believe you we love you and we thank you we commit it to you now in Jesus name amen amen Romans 8 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called Accord according to his purpose for whom he did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also Justified and whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we then say to these things if God be for us who can be against us all right let's go over to Ezekiel watch me I pull my thing out while I go I'll have to find it I pulled out my card one Ago by accident okay says behold All Souls are mine as the soul of the father so also the soul of the son is mine the soul that sinth it shall die you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word now we'll try to take up where we left off this morning not background much but want to continue on in the thought of we're talking about what is a soul and we we got into the point there of talking about the about es and there's a lot of quotes to it but talking about the soul the prophet said is the nature of the spirit all right now to take that as I said this morning without following through on the Bible and understanding The Prophet's message and the doings you could just make it any kind of a nature of something just you know a bird dog has a nature to be a bird dog it's it's not like an old hound it's it points it does it don't have to be trained to do those things it does it automatically right and you can say well that's just the nature of that dog well that's true and that's doing and and you look at a person as they're doing and and you can say well I can recognize that uh father of that child because uh the child Walks Like acts like the father all right but that's just the nature part that's just something that's motivating you I'm trying to get you to a point and I to think about you know what a soul really is we gave the definition this morning it's a person it's being all right we talked about this morning the fact of Soul and Spirit being an interchangeable word all right but I just looking while ago because I had I had you know I was thinking about it and psalmist David says three times my soul thirsteth after thee or for thee whatever see and I just run it in there and looked and I think it's 168 times that the Bible uses my soul so it's a very important part is it's not something that's just the nature of something you know it is what causes our nature all right now follow me with that thought the soul is the you the person that you are and that's what causes a reaction to take place through your spirit out into your body we'll get to it in a little while where the Prophet keeps saying you know soul that sinth it doesn't say the spirit that sinth it says the soul that sinth amen cu the soul is the real you it's the part that God is working on because you can be anointed as we said this morning what you can be anointed on your spirit and still be lost but if that soul is truly born again see then it can never be lost am all right now then being as we believe in the one true and living God and not believing in a second person or third person or whatever but believing that God came himself to die for you and I amen then the spirit that he gave could come back and anoint right right your spirit amen see in body he was a man which made him my brother right in spirit is the anoint or anointing yes and that anointing could be on you and you still be lost right that's that was a hard one when we first begin to talk about those things that the prophet was saying wouldn't it but do you realize what I'm trying to say yes that Soul that's in you as we'll get to in a minute by the new birth that is the soul of almighty God Amen the person of Almighty God coming and living in you and that's your new birth it's a person it's not just an anointing see if it's just an anointing you just be anointed one that's right but it's the very person of almighty God to come and live inside of you and I all right and then that way it's more real than anything else about you that's true now I'm going to make a hard statement now so listen to me then the Soul being like it is is more real than anything you see amen right that's right CU you can blow all this away and you can't destroy the soul that's right that's why the Bible says it we get to at the end Baby Don't Fear him that can destroy the body that's right fear Him him that can destroy the soul that's see nobody can destroy the soul no God is the only one that can do that all right so then the Soul is the real part of you all right as we talk about this morning we title it the soul but we're going to talk about this afternoon and then maybe the Lord willing Wednesday a little more the real you I can't see you brother Gary but we're taught that right I see the body you inhabit you can deceive me that's right because you can act religious that's right you can act a Christian that's right you can do every bit of that that's true and it not be right that's right now the kind old priest is the prophet gave the definition who married you who who dedicated your babies who uh loaned you money who who done everything the kind of O pra now Jesus Just Whipped people and hollered and screamed at them all the time who would we have picked to being the right one you see me deceiving you is not going to help me right that's one thing I've always been an open book and I guess maybe I'm too open and I I I do that way but I've just always been an open book I don't believe in lying and and hiding you know you say well I'm not lying or no but maybe I'm hiding you know and it's kind of like brother Mo was telling about a guy you heard me tell you before little boy down here in town they were all cutting up doing things and the police came by and shine a light around this little boy was hiding behind a a little Old Post you know well it was more outside the post and there was behind it but to shine a light on him said what you doing boy he said hiding and we can hide all we want to and play all games we want to but the soul is the one that's going to answer that's right now you've heard the story of the lady that grieved the holy spirit away from her and wouldn't receive it we'll get to that in the message and that grieved so far away from her that she didn't realize what was going on she said I could see my mother Soul fry in hell and life offered brother Brown him a drink of liquor offered him a cigarette everything because she grieved it away but when she become to the place of dying the prophet said her soul came up but you remember what the preacher had the doctor to do shoot her with a hypo and knock her unconscious right and her screaming out let's don't get down to that part let's be straight serious am and no matter what let's just do what God says and mo follow it that away all right so we asked the Prophet this morning what is the soul he said the soul is the nature of the spirit so whatever I'm displaying you know real genuine now not being hypocritical hiding it but whatever I'm displaying is whatever is inside of me amen right no that ought to make you think about the evidence of the Holy Ghost whether or not the spirit and you agree with the word but you can say I agree with the word and live like the devil that's right now something went wrong didn't it but just think about it see the nature of the spirit is the soul of man whatever it is that's making you and I what we are is the real soul Soul amen all right now by that by the way that I scream and holler you know the way I try to preach I think you ought to know what's with inside of me okay that's right amen because I display it that's right and I'm not hypocritical to to be one thing with you and something else with somebody else or any different I try to be the same good or bad you know because that's the only way to be so then you look out at the world and you see them living and doing wrong and people says oh look at them oh they they're just they're they're going to go to hell they you know they're they're just Sinners that's right you know what they're doing they're just just displaying what's in their soul that's right because their Spirit between the soul and the body is making the parts working in the memories and the and then the body is displaying it openly that's right right see because that's what we were trying to get to this morning ending it up was what borned Satan's domain closer akin to the devil Prophet said born between Satan and Eve you know in the condition we're in and living the same way as the world lives so then that's the that's what our soul really is that's and the Soul lives on no matter what you do to the body the soul will live on until the time that it either gets eternal life either has eternal life will get eternal life or will be destroyed yes and that's the real you right right that's what you are right you say well that's hard brother de on C and A lot of times I have bad thoughts I ain't got nothing do you Soul that's right right amen unless it is the nature of it right right right right now if the Bible's right and we believe it in the prophet Jesus was tempted in all points that's right all right was it wrong you know could he stop the devil from talking to him but he couldn't get to the inward part of him that's right he could talk about the body try to make him hungry he could talk about the spirit try to get him to reason and think on things but he couldn't get to the inside right amen that Inside Man spoke back out and said yes sir get behind me yes did God really thought the devil was real well just remember the devil is not a soul so the soul of man is greater than the devil amen even in a lost condition the devil we talk about him having power he only has power that God allows him to use right remember the prophet preaching that there there's no two Powers there only power he said one of them is a permitted power that's right but that Soul inside of you is going to live on no matter what happens to the flesh all right but see then we just say it's when it's just the nature no it's not just the nature I keep saying that but when you say it's just a nature you're bringing it down into a lower category that's right to toally than what I'm talking about I'm not talking about just a nature of something right just a bird dog or a hound dog or a I'm talking about the very life that you are amen that's right and just think about a man back there like the psalmist David yet in a lost condition right you agree he was not a born again Christian it wasn't back there that's right but yet he'd say my soul thirsted after thee my soul it's the soul of man now watch no matter whether it's Christian or Saint was created of God cuz that's why it says Ezekiel 18:4 All Souls are mind the soul of the father soul of the son All Souls are mine right amen all right then there's no way the devil could give you a soul cuz it'd be a Creator that's right and he can't do it that's right now that soul is so um marvelous until you've heard the prophet tell the story of or tell about that a woman is fixing to have a baby he said just a little prior before she had has the child he says there just a sweet presence comes around that person you know he said it's that little life waiting to come into that body that's going to be produced all right is it just a spirit floating around is it the soul one brother there then how could the soul just into you don't know well you tell me how it can out because it can if you die that's you worried about how it gets in there then right but think with me that soul is the real you that's right amen that's why in the in Genesis it said let us make man yes but what did he make what did he make back there the soul all right but see then it's not just the nature of something it is the nature of the spirit because the spirit then displays what is the inward part right of the being all right then we got over that far this morning so let's pick up we'll try to pick up some of this we got some extra notes I had another part we move it over so okay we try to do the best we can go ahead and look at number seven because that's kind of where we were ending up this morning in the the message and uh we'll just try to start it from here and we'll go as far as we can and it don't bother me to have to preach on it again Wednesday night but look now this is 1963 Souls that are in prison now paragraph 36 now the soul of man is not the body of man it's the soul and the soul is something that's the the nature of the spirit right and see you could take that and you just well it's just the nature of a spirit see it's read on when he said we are dead the scripture PL it tells us that we are dead and our lives are HID in God through Christ sealed there by the Holy Spirit it wasn't your body died it wasn't your spirit died we get time we get to the new birth and you'll see then from the scriptures I give you new heart I give you new spirit amen but then it doesn't say it and I'll give you another Spirit what' it say remember the new heart is justification the new spirit is because that you couldn't even live with your own self all right we said I put my spirit in you right there's your new birth right all right see when he said we're dead the scripture plainly tell us we are dead and our lives are hidden God through Christ sealed our by the Holy Spirit now it wasn't that your body died it wasn't your spirit died it was the nature of your spirit died see the nature which is the soul now listen to him the nature of your soul is is God if you're born again that's right right now you're saying well that's a nature of a nature no it's a display outwardly of what's inwardly that's right right that's right see the nature of your soul what is God if you're born again that's right if it's not it's of the world that's true all right now the nature of your soul is the world if you're lost if you're born again it's of God is that simple so when somebody comes along and talks to you about well it's just the nature and what brother R said the nature of your soul is God if you're born again that's right if not it's of the world that's right that should be a answer that you should remember right that's right all right anything to begin has an end so therefore the only way that you can have eternal life is to have a life that never did begin yes and then your life did begin when you were born when God breathed the breath of life into your nostrils and you became a living soul and You Begin then but when you watch that nature that was in you paragraph 37 by Nature you was of the world alienated from God that's right you were actually an animal that's exactly right anyone knows that a that we are mammal and many knows that we are a mammal we are a warm-blooded animal that's that's what we are by our Earthly creation but you see what made us different from other animals that God put a soul upon us now there looks like something just put up on but we'll read on down here see it's not something just put up that's right amen all right see the other mammals don't have to wear clothes no other animal has to wear clothes to hide his shame but us we're the only one that does it because we have a soul that's just not something put on you right that's anointings and things it's the real you amen it's what you are that's right all right the nature of the world was in us that's right amen all right now look what he says on the next we go to number eight the uncertain sound 1955 7:31 what I'm doing if you'll notice I'm going backwards and force the older tapes to the newer tapes where people says well he changed these things you'll find him all the way through the message from 47 to 65 saying that the soul is the nature of the spirit he doesn't say the spirit is the nature of the soul in those words but that's what it is but it's not in that term okay but that's what we are we're supposed to be whatever is within us the inner part is supposed to be displayed in the second realm okay right and then that's supposed to be displayed through the body right if not we're hypocrite that's right you know something's wrong the outside can be religious and even get an anointing upon that Spirit to be so great that's right brother R said about the lady we're talking one of them he said that's the reason you can't tell her it's wrong to wear pants now said cuz she's anointed and see if you're anointed I mean I'm I'm honest come on now just I like to talk honest but hate to be but it's good point you know find you a preacher that's going to get up and say well I don't know whether I'm preaching the truth or not you ever heard one say that that yes see no everybody swies by what they're preaching the Lord told me this yes right all right well look let's just read some things as I was saying a few days ago either here or somewhere speaking on the lie detector talking about the lie detector and how it works now notice close now I I want you pay close attention put a lie detector on you and you try to impersonate the the truth and try to say that it's the truth but down on the inside of you what sub the subconscious lays a place called a soul and this intellectual mind does not govern the vibration of the system the mind is only a director it will direct you now subconscious well that's just some kind of a sub you know you got your brain you go through it you got your conscious your subconscious your unconscious right but he's bringing out that the subconscious part of you is your soul now in body are you listening to his definition yes you can lie that's right you've seen people that D straight face tell you a ball face lie that's right I told you about it old boy used to tell so many lies we wrod to work together and then when he get at work he tell that thing again two or three times and he said Sam ain't that right I said by Highway cuz he'd even change it after he told it to me and expect me to agree with him yeah but listen you put a lie detector on you does that Li detector is it governed by your body is it governed by your spirit or is it governed by your unconscious you can train that Spirit that's right right that's right you can trick in every way but that subconscious part of you that real you is not going to lie why because you're made in the image of God no matter what you think about a soul the soul of man will get to it in a minute is in the image of God and it can't lie the real you can't lie the lie detector will show up that's right all right so listen your intellectual mind does not govern that vibration of the system the mind is only director it will direct you and it's it it is very incapable of bringing you to God see all of that your mind you cannot know God by your mind intellectual it's one of the resources or the channels that would lead you to it but your soul is what governs you you are what you are by your soul your soul is what governs you you are what you are by your soul now look at this definition Jesus said to the Pharisees says why you Hypocrites how can you speak good things when they was calling him good master and so forth right didn't want to kill him that's right sit out of the abundance of the heart speak of the lips and in your heart you hate me and in your lips you call me good Master he's describing a die detector wouldn't show up like that he said you Hypocrites see your soul is thinking one thing and you're speaking with your lips another thing what a case good definition of a hypocrite a that's right amen what a horrible thing what a deceitful thing is a hypocrite for out of their mind they say one thing when their soul says another thing I think that's a good definition don't you yes of what it is all right so your soul is what governs you look at the next one thirsting for Life 1958 611 par or 15 did you ever read such words how my soul longer for thee in a thirsty land where no water is that's David right this is rather an unusual text but God is unusual remember he's thirsting for life God does unusual things he works mysterious way way is wonders to perform and we're living in an unusual day in an unusual time but we're serving the god that's seen all times God that's been excuse me in all time and when I thought of this you know my soul thirst is for day if your soul is what directs you is what makes you what you are come on a conversion is now watch him he's going to explain a conversion a soul is the nature of the spirit and when a man is converted he doesn't get another Spirit he gets a spirit change now he's in it real a conversion means to change his thinking change his way of living and so forth so my soul thirsteth for thee can't you just see David out there and all of those things that's happening but yet in all of the bad that he could do but on the home way from the bed the prophet said from the bed with basba he cries out return unto me the joy of thy salvation am he knew there was something wrong he knew he wasn't supposed to be doing that he just took his best friend which was one of his mighty men and took his wife he knew that as a sinner get that Soul within him may I get just a little deeper in the thought was it just some anointing that came on him that he could kill a bar a Lon or a giant was it just some anointing that would raise up or was it the real part of David on the inside that he said was thirsting after God sure it was the anointing right we know that but that anointing was connected with David right right think on these things all right look at the next one you must be born again 61 12:31 paragraph 1 11 a soul good or bad death doesn't change it I've had a lot of scripture wrote down I had a lot of scripture wrote down on here on this one that I wanted to comment on what is a soul what is a soul it's you you you are soul the part inside of you and when you die ever watch shap that Soul's in that's the way it goes It goes to its destination you couldn't pull it up no matter how much you do what you do for it that Soul's got to be changed here and born again that's right simple thought isn't it yes look at the next one souls in prison paragraph 44 63 1110 but that Soul that's in there see that soul is what God is working on see that's right he's not working on your body and we are taught now let's see if you agree with me we are taught by the prophet not to uh try to pull people to the altar right you know not to go down the aisles and and you need to come to the Lord you know your mama was a good Mama and she's in glory you want to be in glory with Mama don't you we're taught not to do that is that right right that's right everybody agree amen you said but I'm L of the Lord now if you're letter of the Lord you go ahead and do it okay but there's one thing about it he's going to speak aely to me to get me to walk that aisle and put my hand on you and try to convince you to come to the altar because the prophet said that wasn't right he said this way he said you make them a twofold child of hell he said it'll be double harder the next time to get them to come to the altar right do what you want to I love to stud what he says cuz I can be in the scripture with all right so now watch it's not to try to scare this body you're going to burn in hell if you don't come to the Altar and get saved it's not to dealing with your memory your conscience your affections you want to be in heaven with Mama Don't You Mama's in glory and you want to be there I know you don't like it I know a lot of people don't like it but I remember where I came from and I remember the days when people tried to talk me into going to the altar I've told you about it that I told the Deacon board or some of them when they come to try to talk to me about the Lord I said I live a better life than your Deacon board lives and I'm lost and they didn't want me to explain what I cuz I was capable of it name calling you know but see I've just always been honest I like the little story you know they bring all the kids up to the Altar and they pray and everything they get through and and they asked each one of them said the Lord done anything yes yes yes they asked this one said the Lord done he said no well see he was probably the one that answered correctly all right so Christianity is not dealing with bodies that's right it's not dealing with Spirits he dealing with the inside of you how many times you ever heard me say I don't talk to bodies I don't talk to spirits I'm preaching to the inside of you amen amen now forgive me but to say it what about in this message that all you hear is women's dress and hiring clothes and is your wife worthy of the Gospel you notice why I said that is your wife worthy of the Gospel we get our wives straight up we ready to go is it the emotional side of it you know telling the wonderful story stories that's always been amazing to me preacher get up and talk about how bad Jesus was beaten horrible and all the things he went through and everybody yeah yeah dry no tears didn't they start talking about brother brandom and his wife in his life and everybody's just crying all over the place oh yeah if I'm going to cry I'm going to cry about Jesus and what he done then I don't have to worry about crying about brother randam and his wife right I hope something's doning on you it's not to get our bodies lined up it's not to get our spirit because neither one are the born again right is to talk to your soul amen MH Brother D I don't like you cuz you spoke straight to me amen did I call you name you know my story you know my point if I got one problem in here I'll come to you if I got two I got two trips to make I just go the pull pit talk straight I want to talk to you soul to soul amen I want to talk to you about my God and who he is and what he done for me and like I said Wednesday night I don't understand I don't understand this one how that the people of this message can sit and sympathize with the preachers when are they going to say you're not saying what Paul said you're not saying what brother Ram said amen but brother you don't understand that brother he don't know what you no how old is he if he stay out of Walmart read he might know something right right look that soul is what God is working on there's no parts of your salvation working through your body that's right you said Y no no something on the inside is what makes your body stop doing things that's right amen right right the new birth is in the soul of man okay yes it's in the real you yes see that is that soul is what God is working on Amen see all right then if I can preach to you now here here's one thing gets me I'm sorry people say brother Dale You're Just Too Deep you too you preach on these deep things and brother brandham preaching as he did I believe was the deepest teacher that's ever been outside the Lord Jesus Christ don't you right when you agree with that now I'm just honest but yet he was the one that taught us these things and he could preach Souls that are in prison now and the altar fill up some of you were sitting there and seen him preach some of the deepest messages you've ever seen and people weep their way to the altar right was he preaching little sugar tips little baby thing and the people come to the altar was you preaching clothes and hiring dress the people come to the altar or was he preaching to the soul of the individual that's right it's in here or we just read it one he said if he can get to nature of that soul to agree with him it's in souls and prison did that nature or die come on that soul is what God is working on if it here it is if it can only get that nature that Spirit to agree with him then that nature dies the nature and the love of the world dies and the things of the world is dead see because if you love the world and the things of the world the love of God is not in you see a man must be born again so this Nature has to die and the nature of God comes and lives in you and God is the only thing that there is that never did begin or never did end so therefore he has partnership you that's see right and taken this man Earthly and this eternal spirit and put it together amen not anointing right right because God reflects himself back in there that he become a man when he become Christ Jesus and he was God see God was in Christ that see lived in him reconcile in the world himself and through that perfect man each one of us imperfect that believe in God and has accepted that becomes the Perfection of him amen and he never left his body see corruption neither did he leave his soul in hell but raised him up on the third day and he's alive forever more and we'll have a body like a his glorious body that's why we're baptized into his name that's that we might come forth in his name in his death in his resurrection that we Rise Again testifying to the world that we have new life that the old man is Dead We buried that first nature see the first nature is gone and now we are the nature of him he lives in US amen and we don't do our own will we don't we do his will we don't think our own thoughts now listen to this one the mind the mind is what thinks get spiritual for a second on what he's saying the mind that was in Christ is in every believer right the mind that was in Christ in an never believer did you get a brain transplant when you born again did your spirit annihilate and you got another spirit the mind that was in Christ Jesus is an every believer see there there is the soul and that's what we're speaking of now that's the part I'm thinking of now that that's within us the soul so when Paul was saying the mind of Christ he said I have the mind of Christ you wasn't talking about his head right you talking about a born again experience in his soul that the mind of Christ could dwell in his soul because the mind of Christ is the soul of almighty God Amen come on amen what do we think about it that's the part that I'm thinking of that's within us that's soul in prison 1963 1110 look at Ezekiel 18:4 we just read behold All Souls are mine as the soul of the father so also the soul of the son is mine God's the only Creator the only way you can get a soul it's there not a nature that's indwelled in you I've made myself clear we are born in Satan's domain Satan can't give us a soul so he perverts the nature of that soul to him right right amen okay but look what he sums up this is only two times in the Bible said the soul that sinth it shall die is that is that who's the English major in here behold comma all things are M you know the two little doing when you got down to the two dots so also so the soul of the son is mind stop and think don't stop start another sentence don't start another thought stop and think about what's being said right slow down pause just a little that two dots and that other dot with a long line both of them are basically not means it's just to slow down and think a period means stop a comma means slow down and just continue going I ain't no endless major I'm reading by Revelation not what's in English language because he says behold All Souls are mine the soul of the father Soul it's mine so now let me sum it up the soul that sin us shall die I said there's only two places Ezekiel 1820 is the other one go ahead with that the soul that sinth it shall die if you'll notice on 184 back prior to 184 it says this Parable shall not be spoken anymore you know about you you eating grapes and your children get to you know teast problems you eating graes makes a bitter than the baby no no not for the daddy especially the soul that sinth it shall die the soul shall not bear the iniquity of the father so the excuse me the son shall not bear the iniquity of the father right he's going to go on his own right because he's a soul Le shall the father by the iniquity of the son the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon Him son don't answer for the father father don't answer for the son in the New Testament amen that's right right right the soul that sinth it shall die amen it'll die why because of what it is right look at the next one this is take them to that day on Calvary 60 1969 25 paragraph 46 there was a requirement for sin requirement was death death was the penalty and that we go into great details of this but because I do not believe that there is but one death and he's not talking about the second death there is just one death cuz it's when you die there is one life and I believe a man that has eternal life can never die I believe there is a complete annihilation of that soul that sins there is a complete annihilation of the soul that sin so we either going to get annihilated and get the new birth and die to ourselves and let him cleanse that out or we're going to die at the second Resurrection have to go to the Judgment right right I believe there is a complete annihilation of that soul that sins for the Bible said the soul that sinth it say surely die not the man now what is he saying that it doesn't say the man it doesn't say your spirit it doesn't say the spirit that sth it shall die it doesn't say the man that sent it it says the soul y right the real you all right the soul that sin us so Satan must surely die to be completely destroyed he different with the Universalist that says Satan will be saved he said and he's the originator of sin now get all mixed up here and his soul sinned you talking much Satan well you just said want to go Satan didn't have soul and he was a spirit that sure Spirit shall totally be totally annihilated but need nothing left of it it's not saying Satan's got a soul and make him a person okay totally annihilated let's just read this next one 1956 422 e 73 on the choice of father and a soul that sinth it shall die is that right that means to separate death means separation he that heareth my word believeth on him who sent me has everlasting life cannot die but when you grieve that Soul it goes away from you it was done far from her now that's the lady he's talking about didn't talk to her no more but when her intellects begin to wreck up she said there there's nothing left here but the soul had to come back well what was what condition was it in see when it walked up began to rebuke her for the life she'd live she said oh my God I'm lost sound like he's talking about even just her Natural Soul comes back you've heard the story of her she's the when it goes on and says I could see my mother frying Soul frying held in life but brother d i i you can't grieve he says you can grieve the holy spirit away from you that's right y you can Grieve Your Soul until that Soul won't be able to correct you what corrects you when you do wrong why is it that we as human beings when we first started come on First Drink You Took did you feel good about it or did you feel bad about taking it you thought I shouldn't take it something said don't you don't supposed to take it that's not that little two little devil thing you know the devil horns and the horns sit went on inside of you the one says drink it the other one says don't drink it it's inside of you right that Soul was never made to sin it's the real you it wasn't made to do wrong and it'll correct you if you listen yes amen but if you just keep grieving it away it'll go totally away from you even your own soul part there won't be no contact you just be living that's what he's explaining about her so what is it let's see if I can find one I got it somewhere here may have it done read it and missed over the point I wanted to make we've evidentally done Reddit because he said is the real you the real you is the soul whether you're a sinner or a saint the real you is the soul there's nothing more real in life than the soul of man amen that's a real you amen now when these days when we get through with predestination I'll preach on the real you the real you see the real you is that Soul down in there right it's greater than your body it's greater than your spirit it's the real you is what you are but the soul that sinth it shall die see there is no such thing as the spirit that sinth the soul that sinth you shall die what is the second death got it in here if you need it the second death is the death of the Soul over which have no part no second death have no part the second death the death of the Soul first death is your natural life dying second death is the death of the Soul all right so we either going to die here and get born again are we going to die there that's our choice you say die Brother D I don't want to die that's where the trouble's at quitting this quitting that don't do this don't do that what did I say the other day the prophet said he asked him there what must we do to be saved he said we tell them what not to do don't drink don't smoke quit all these things he said that was not the question they asked what must we do to be born again what was their answer repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of of what Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost D to ourselves all right now let me spend a minute read I'm going to let the rest of the notes go I'll pick up the other part Wednesday let's just talk a little bit now if I'm a triun being Body Spirit and soul all right and that triun being that I am that means my soul is what's Eternal by the new birth but my spirit and my body is not Eternal now if the lady that we just read about the girl that she could grieve her own soul cuz he wasn't talking about the new birth for her she grieved her own soul so much in other words she kept putting it back you know drinking and doing all things numbing it with all kind of things but one day it came back up when she started to die in one quote he says when the the elements of the body body breaking down said her soul came up and she said I'm lost what about all those years she grieved it away then would it be easy for you to understand that how anointed ones can be anointed and that's where you can't tell them anything I'm as honest as I can be I don't want to go out and preach to the people of this message I lost that desire a long time ago you know what I'd rather go down here in town of Lula on the street corner that's bad I know it but I figure I'd get more results talking to Sinners lost people then I would the people of this message has got it all figured out I see it I say without backing up the biggest portion of the anointed ones in the end time are people who claim to be following this message oh you can't tell them the truth you can give them a thus sayth the Lord where the Prophet said it and they won't believe it I mean what he he literally would would say this is this this is thus sayith the Lord you know what I mean even his own words they're not going to believe it why because you see when you come into this message and you start studying this message it's very easy for that Spirit to come and anoint you because you are trying to study the message that's right follow with me a little you want to go to church you want to do right you remember you remember when you heard of the message and you really wanted to hear yes and you'd do anything to get a book or a tape right but now they're laying on your shelf at home we don't listen to tapes all the time the last night alone we listen to three men mes I was sitting there thinking I Lord I've been to church three times tonight but yet what did everybody else doing and I said I don't we don't listen tapes all the time but what is our desire what's our are doing why is it among the people of the message now and I'm watching it very close closely here in luland I see it that people are just dying the up Zeal is not here that it was when you first heard the word I don't mind saying within my own self sometimes I get to a down spot I'm human I get to a down spot and I need a little boost but I've told you also when that starts happening I know what to do I get in the message and I start searching cuz I know Satan is going to try to stop me from getting something that's right right that's right see when he can make me give up and not search he's got me conquered may I quote brother Brandon brother brandom said I've got to do something I've lost the love for the people do you need that quote or do you really remember him saying it he said I've lost the love for the people he said I got to do something even a born again Soul they still got a body and a spirit to deal with right but brother Dale isin't it reasonable that that brother's trying to say something I defend people and I have I've defended ministers who started off into doctrines and publicly told people and said don't fool with them because they're trying to say something but then when they come on out and say what they believe then I just back away and say okay let it go but you see the soul of man is a wonderful thing what we need to do is find out if that thing inside of us is the holy spirit right right now brother brandom said he sent back his soul and I've got these we I use a few of them Wednesday we know that it was his soul his Spirit his theophany of his being that went to hell now that's pretty good statement a soul Spirit the off of his being that pretty well sums up one God doesn't it right so who went to hell well Jesus the second person he went down that was the soul of God that went to hell it was not the soul of Jesus that was the second person or a human being and went to hell for you and I I don't have to go then he doesn't pay my price amen but what about that Soul inside of you does it thirst after God like I heard somebody say one time it pretty good point said reason sometimes God wakes you up in the middle of the night you ain't got nobody to talk to PR good point I never grip when I wake up 5:00 this morning we getting up till 600 I get up 6:00 anyway on Sunday morning 5:00 and wide awake well Lord I don't understand I I don't sometimes maybe we blame him for so why don't you talk to him the fell said that time said don't try counting sheep right one 2 3 8,43 talk to the shepherd right right yes sir he woke you up for some reason talk to him if nothing else just say and I walk through the house of Minion and just say Lord I love you amen just that's all get so pulled away till I can't even pray but I can still say I love you Lord forgive us be with everybody I go to the seats you know the needs then sometimes I can't do that and I just say I love you you ever do that with him have you ever told the Lord that you really love him and mean it I mean mean it that's right I doubt if some of you ever told your wife or husband that you loved them and meant it might solve a lot of problem your wife gets all upset at you or your husband gets all upset at you just look at say I love you that you're so pretty when you're mad might Sol a lot of problems you know hard tell anybody often they tell you they love you you ever tried it oh yeah you look at them little kids eyes and then man you know you got to whip them you got the stick you know you got to whip them and you look at her eyes and they look at it say Daddy I love you Mommy I love you y I love you too I'll still be loving you when I get to spanking you let see if you going to love me when you through with us fighting maybe that's why the Lord has to chasen us sometime maybe he has to let us know he loves us you realize that we say we're sick and but you realize if you're sick and God healed you you realize that was one of his attributes and you know he had to let you be sick that's right or he could heal you little different what we think is it but I hope you get to point we'll car it on Wednesday night the real you is that soul that is within that body and that spirit is looking back at me through eyes but it's that real Soul down inside of there right does it thirst after God Amen does it long after God I said Lord Reveal Your word reveal your word I preached to you a long time ago about 1980 right or more before then I said it takes the opening of the word to bring the virtues well then you can say no I I need patience I just get patience will help yourself tribulation work of patience what do you need me to do that won't work it's not knowledge of how much you can read in the pyramid so why don't you pray for a revelation a revelation can add a virtue amen you believe it let's Stand Together come on brother think on these things the real you is that Soul the real part of us that can be Eternal is that Soul only by this Soul being Eternal can ever my body think of being Eternal right what about it church have you ever met the real you what do you mean meet Maria I was thinking about somebody one time and the way they were acting and reacting the best way I can tell it all at once something happened and my vision became just like it stayed like this like I was looking at perenial or what you call it out here it didn't move but I just moved backward [Music] and that hole was there and I backed up I looked at that person through a different set of eyes and I saw their desires it was better than mine I was ready to condemn right did the prophet one time get ready to go out and blast that woman and the Man in the restaurant and the Holy Spirit said come on a door I need to talk to you now did he go out there and scream and holler at her about drinking and the clothes she was wearing and the vulgar thing she was doing did that convert her no he went out there and told her what God said to him and said you want to kill her when look at your sins same thing the lady got converted right not preaching to bodies not preaching to Spirits it's preaching to souls the only way I know to do that is just keep preaching the truth of the goel El it'll contact you somewhere down the line or else you'll get offended at it and leave because you have to someday we all have to prove what we are my wife and I talking about this the other day we're in the day of manifestation you can't get a guy to run for president right cuz they put his name on there and they're fixing he's fixing a run all at once he's got 18 illegitimate kids everything in the book right first question you ever done dope well have you ever took medicine you know what you've done you just done a little dope right come on folks but yet people if the man up front would say I'm going to run for president I've been married 14 times I got 18 IL legitimate kids and I smoked dope all of my life but I quit 20 years ago and I'm trying my best to get the world to see it's wrong and said he can run for president but you let him cover that up just a little bit and they know he's lying to him huh John F Kennedy told the world that there was seven Banks supplying him the money to run for president and who was the guy after then that come up and they got to complaining cuz all of the people was giving him money he told it right out in the front of everybody I've never been the one to stand up for anybody but Old Clinton said what is is is is what can you do with a guy when he does that you know that Clinton left the office with the highest rating of any president that has ever been we got a video at home it shows some of the presidents and he left the office for the highest rating of any president was Clinton lying rasal what about it folks that Soul that's within there is the real you and that's what I'm trying to talk to that's why I Don't Preach clothes and hair and dress I say it sometimes right you know why I say it some sometimes cuz I see people that I believe are Christians that start floating around just a little bit you know playing around just a little dresses just get a little bit lower maybe slits come up just a little bit more maybe clothes get a little too tight I'm talking about Christians and then I say something about it but don't preach on the never service go ahead brother what we got go ahead [Music] do you anybody have need just coming let's believe [Music] I've been in that down for a while it's made me irritable made me say things that I shouldn't say to my family I don't believe that [Music] brother how he has that some kind of a word you call it Neurosis or something it's a condition in the feat and the things that but I believe that God is the Healer but I like his attitude he said because of the pain and the things he said it's made me very irritable well I'm honest maybe sometimes that's why things happen to get us to realize hey wait a minute got just a little bit too much but I know a Healer I know a savior that can take care of all the [Music] problems he can handle all of it if we just let him right let's just believe with our brother that the Lord will take care of his problem he's got to go to the doctor they tell him that he's got to do that he knows what the condition Brother Gary has a he knows what it is but I's having it people are having it and that's some kind of a problem and it can be caused by anything it's not a it's not a quote disease is a fact of a disease that you know just make something happen to the body brother how telling me where to go it can be all over your body not just your legs your feet well let's believe it believe that God will take care of it but to give our brother peace in his heart and to take away any problems brother John Martin said one time as a good point he said sometimes we're too close to ourselves we can't pray we ask somebody else to pray for us so let's just believe that brother how to be everything be taken care [Music] of what he's asked for father in the name of Jesus Christ the one that I spoke about and strive to get people to see that soul of almighty God I believe it lives in our brotherr I believe he's a Christian Lord he's fought the fight of the message for all of these years Lord he made a statement one day and God touched him he said Brother D said I believe the same God that was here the prophet was here is still here and if you'll ask him it'll be all right and it was so we ask you again take away these things and let our brother's True Heart and Soul come out into being take away the pain the agony take away the what's causing it Satan in the name of Jesus Christ you take your hands off of God's Property and that's not the words of just us thinking it's the the word of God it said we have a right to lay hands on the sick and expect to see the results we believe you father we thank you for it and now just let him come and make it a manifestation into our brother that all will be well in Jesus name amen and amen I believe it don't [Music] you i s I'm one of the ones you's talking to and you know it next few months I let make me down about my eyes [Music] father you heard our brother Lord sincere heart has come forth of saying that you got problems and troubles Lord we know what Satan will do when he brings pain and Agony upon the body it has a turmoil upon our spirit being and Lord can even affect that inward part and Lord we just ask you father to reach down and receive our brother and his repentance and his cleansing up of the wrong things Lord not going going out in the world of sin as much as just letting sin creep in where that we have a wrong attitude in our thoughts we just ask you father to just touch him and believe and we believe Lord all is well in Jesus name amen think about [Music] it have you ever thought about praying this way now we believe we're Christians right we believe we have within us the new birth right have you ever thought about praying and saying [Music] Lord my old body is messed up but you know you put your life in me it's living in my soul so then you're not happy living in a body that's hurting right you're not happy Lord living in a body that's hurting so it's not just me you're asking for this also you're asking for this body to be made whole to where you can be happy you don't to pray that or what our little sister has had that old cold in the ear problems and we just pray the Lord will touch them right let's just pray for them Lord Jesus we bring it for you these little children they're not like us they haven't done the problems in life and all they're just good little children and Lord Jesus we ask you to just reach down and touch and we place the blood of Jesus Christ between these little sisters and the little youa there Lord

tests testing out the potassium in his body that can be a problem with it cause a lot of troubl we just ask you father that when they run the test that they'll say all is well but father just saying

sicknesses that's trying to afflict our brother in Jesus name anybody else [Music] everything will be all right amen okay father in the name of Jesus Christ we send this prayer CL and all will be well

here [Music] and I know I've been through some problems here but they're not problems it's just and I oh that's a good thought but the thought is not to be the got out of the way the thought is to get ourselves out of the way and let him have what he needs maybe we're in a case sometimes of sickness as the prophet said because he needs to contact you know what he needed and then to be you told me what this morning yes I did yes I want me to be still enough then maybe maybe he's working out what he needs to but we don't want to get in way but let's believe father you heard our sister Lord she just wants to get herself out of the way Lord that you could come and live in her life and cleanse everything out and make it right for you because we believe you Lord we would even be willing sometimes maybe to just get on out of the way and let things be wrong but that's not your way of doing things your way of doing things Is A Healer a deliverer a savior one who guides in each and every
