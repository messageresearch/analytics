[8:31] out the things and all and all of the
[8:34] Brethren are invited to come and be with
[8:36] us and just have a good time
[8:38] okay now I think that's all I'm supposed
[8:41] to cover so go to Ephesians 1
[8:44] and then Matthew 17.
[8:50] a precious Heavenly Father we thank you
[8:52] Lord for the day and hour and the time
[8:55] that we can have thank you for Lord just
[8:58] being you and revealing yourself unto us
[9:02] that we truly can find out who our
[9:04] father really is as the prophet said
[9:06] there Lord one day he said I found out I
[9:08] wouldn't have sent a Charleston Ella
[9:10] Branham he wouldn't deny his natural
[9:12] parents but he found out who his real
[9:14] father is and Lord we're beginning to
[9:16] realize that and realization so we ask
[9:18] you to just help us and give us
[9:21] understanding as we read your words you
[9:22] come and speak to our hearts and lead
[9:25] each one room or the sick among us
[9:26] you've said in your word you sent your
[9:28] word and healed us and delivered us from
[9:30] destruction so we depend upon it we
[9:33] believe you and we thank you for all the
[9:34] promises forgive our sins cover us Lord
[9:37] by your blood may you know that we need
[9:40] to be Sanctified to where that we would
[9:42] just be totally set aside for everything
[9:45] in you guide each and every one of us
[9:47] now in Jesus name amen amen Ephesians 1
[9:52] this is about 12 times reading this you
[9:54] ought to know these scriptures by now
[9:57] Ephesians 1 verse 3 blessed be the God
[9:59] and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who
[10:01] has blessed us with all spiritual
[10:03] blessings in Heavenly places in Christ
[10:05] according as he had chosen Us in him
[10:08] were before the foundation of the world
[10:10] that we should be holy and Without Blame
[10:12] before him in love
[10:14] having what predestinated us were unto
[10:18] adoption the honest unto the adoption of
[10:21] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[10:23] according to the good pleasure of his
[10:25] will to the praise of the glory of his
[10:27] grace wherein he hath made us accepted
[10:29] in the Beloved now let's go back to
[10:32] Matthew's where everybody goes and we're
[10:35] in the adoption trying to bring it in
[10:37] three stages and now we're up to the
[10:40] second stage of adoption which more or
[10:42] less covers the coming to the Mount of
[10:45] transfiguration the experience of the
[10:48] Lord Jesus okay
[10:49] Matthew 17 1 and after six days Jesus
[10:54] taketh Peter James and John his brother
[10:56] and bringeth them up into a high
[10:58] mountain
[10:59] apart and was transfigured before them
[11:02] in his face did shine as the sun in his
[11:04] Reign but was white as the light and
[11:06] behold our appeared unto him Moses and
[11:08] Elias talking with him
[11:09] then answered Peter and said unto Jesus
[11:12] Lord it is good for us to be here if
[11:16] thou Wilt let us make your three
[11:17] Tabernacles one for thee one for Moses
[11:20] and one for life
[11:21] while he spake Behold a bright Cloud
[11:24] overshadowed them and behold a voice out
[11:26] of the cloud which said this is my
[11:28] beloved Son in whom I am well pleased
[11:31] hear ye him you may be seated the Lord
[11:35] had his blessings to the reading of the
[11:38] word
[11:39] as I said we we've been talking about
[11:41] adoption and we we pretty well tried to
[11:44] cover not enough but we covered most of
[11:48] the you know the thoughts that we would
[11:51] want to on that how that you and I are
[11:55] adopted into the family of God by the
[11:58] new birth
[11:59] now I know your adoption goes on to you
[12:02] know and that's the point we're dealing
[12:04] with is Romans 8. where it says that the
[12:07] whole world is groaning waiting for the
[12:09] manifestation of the sons of God all
[12:12] right and that's in this day
[12:14] and we covered in the life's message of
[12:16] expecting the same Ministry of the Lord
[12:19] Jesus Christ to be here the prophet said
[12:22] to bring back The Headstone to the
[12:24] church because the head has never United
[12:27] with the body in this in this part that
[12:31] is to be now on the death Pentecost
[12:33] the head came as the Cornerstone but it
[12:37] couldn't manifest itself as a headstone
[12:39] it has to wait till the last days to do
[12:41] that the prophet said in the church back
[12:44] there he said it was the Cornerstone he
[12:47] said in the full Church
[12:49] it's The Headstone so we're expecting
[12:51] The Headstone to come and I told you a
[12:53] lot of people say oh when I got the new
[12:55] birth I got The Headstone well I don't I
[12:58] don't agree with that because the
[12:59] disciples when they got the new bird
[13:01] they didn't even get the headstone so
[13:03] we've been over these things you know
[13:05] and trying to bring them out to to show
[13:08] you but we've been dealing with coming
[13:10] up to the bases to where like the
[13:12] prophet said you know that when you're
[13:14] born again as a Christian
[13:17] God gives you a checkbook
[13:20] all right and down at the bottom of that
[13:22] checkbook is you know how you sign it
[13:24] the sign Jesus Christ
[13:26] and whatever you have need of you just
[13:28] fill in what it is you need healing you
[13:31] need salvation you need help you need
[13:32] you know whatever you need for life you
[13:35] just fill in what you have need of
[13:37] course you're already signed we said
[13:39] then there would be a day come like in
[13:41] the natural adoption to where that the
[13:44] father would adopt his own child into
[13:46] the family and he said then he would
[13:48] give you the checkbook but said there
[13:51] wouldn't be nothing signed because that
[13:53] way you could fill out what you wanted
[13:55] and then you sign your own name because
[13:57] your name would be just as good as the
[14:00] father on the checkbook if you're really
[14:02] adopted into the family you know
[14:04] correctly all right and that's the
[14:07] stages where we're dealing with and we
[14:09] tried to cover how that in the life of
[14:12] the Lord Jesus Christ
[14:14] that see he had a river Jordan
[14:16] experience
[14:17] and in that experience it says this is
[14:21] my beloved Son
[14:22] you know and whom I'm pleased to dwell
[14:25] all right
[14:26] now he did not need the new birth but he
[14:29] done that as an example for you and I
[14:31] that's right all right see then we have
[14:34] a new birth experience and and the Lord
[14:37] saying I'm pleased to dwell in you
[14:39] that's when you're a newborn baby yeah
[14:41] baby in Christ all right and all people
[14:45] are born again as newborn babies all
[14:48] except 120 it was in the upper room they
[14:51] were born to the place called the faith
[14:53] of the father but three thousand sold
[14:55] just a few hours later or something they
[14:58] started off as babies and that's where
[15:00] the problem is is babies trying to
[15:03] understand God's word they already get
[15:05] it you know they know how to do
[15:07] everything and they know how to you know
[15:08] how you kids are you know you kids now
[15:11] you think you know a whole lot more in
[15:12] your parents you know you're you're just
[15:14] smart as all get out will you wait if
[15:17] time went on you got to be about 30 40
[15:19] years old you'd find out that you didn't
[15:21] know too much when you was about 15 16.
[15:23] you you you'd find that out you'd find
[15:26] out people didn't give a who what you
[15:27] thought you know you're really wanting
[15:29] to try to run the world you can't do it
[15:31] right but anyhow you don't know what
[15:33] we're talking about
[15:34] see and I said we're coming up to then
[15:37] the word that the Lord Jesus said he had
[15:40] a river Jordan experience then he had
[15:42] him out of transfiguration experience
[15:44] all right now the Transfiguration
[15:46] experience that says this is my beloved
[15:48] Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell hear ye
[15:50] him amen all right now that was on about
[15:53] probably uh so we're give just a number
[15:57] six months before Calvary because the
[16:00] prophet said he left right there went
[16:02] straight to Calvary to to be crucified
[16:04] you know and all of that so he went
[16:07] through that and that's what the world
[16:09] was waiting on was to see him all right
[16:11] then we see that we received the new
[16:13] bird
[16:14] to bring us into the body of Christ
[16:17] making us the children of God
[16:20] and then
[16:21] the adoption the tutoring he gives us
[16:23] the tutor and we've seen that you know
[16:26] the tutor is not in the natural the
[16:28] tutor is somebody you are you know you
[16:30] hire a person to tutor your job but in
[16:34] the the Christian experience it's the
[16:37] holy spirit amen and the Holy Spirit is
[16:39] the spirit of the father
[16:42] or else you got two Spirits all right
[16:44] you're all messed up see so it's the
[16:47] Holy Spirit coming to dwell in us which
[16:49] is the spirit of the father to give us
[16:51] his nature so he's inside of us tutoring
[16:55] us right amen sure he's using a
[16:57] five-fold Ministry he's using other
[17:00] people to help and things like that but
[17:02] the main thing is the inside teacher you
[17:05] know and doing that and like I've tried
[17:07] to bring out to you the way I think a
[17:10] lot of people talk about adoption is
[17:11] that the father's leaving the scene you
[17:13] know going off and the sun's coming on
[17:15] that's really making us something I
[17:17] don't agree with that I don't believe it
[17:19] that way that's right I believe adoption
[17:21] is when the father is coming on to scene
[17:23] in the sun right because with that what
[17:26] happened to Jesus right right
[17:29] Second Corinthians 5 and 19 said God was
[17:32] in Christ
[17:33] reconcile in the world into himself amen
[17:35] see that's what happened to to Jesus see
[17:39] he and the father became one
[17:41] I gave you a lot of the things I didn't
[17:43] give back to you tonight but right
[17:45] around said in body he was a man in Soul
[17:48] he was God Amen all right he'd say that
[17:52] in in uh
[17:54] body he was a man and he said in spirit
[17:56] he was God he said that's a mystery but
[17:59] said it's true
[18:00] because that way we're not going into a
[18:03] trinity neither are we going into a
[18:05] Oneness right see we're holding it in
[18:08] the correct order because God was in
[18:10] Christ what happened right when that
[18:12] baby was born that baby that body was a
[18:15] body that was a creation by the word
[18:17] Hebrews 10 5. but see the soul in the
[18:20] spirit was the almighty God Amen that's
[18:23] what the Bible would say that you know
[18:25] he was born Lord to Christ amen see then
[18:28] in doing that then he didn't have to
[18:31] become God as people say on the River
[18:33] Jordan he was born God Amen because God
[18:36] was in that flesh amen you see everybody
[18:38] else wants to make it some kind of a
[18:40] something that comes down on that flesh
[18:42] no no it was God in that you know it's
[18:45] simply to me what one God is amen amen
[18:49] that there he was a body that he created
[18:53] stepped into what Soul and Spirit was
[18:56] almighty God right and the prophet of
[18:59] God said that that Spirit on a tape
[19:00] called faith
[19:02] 1961 he said that that Spirit was the
[19:05] spirit that spoke in this hundred times
[19:07] All right that's right it was the holy
[19:09] spirit amen okay see then when he died
[19:12] there was no problem with him dying the
[19:15] Soul and Spirit just stepped out of the
[19:16] body when the body was dead it stepped
[19:18] out of your body your soul your spirit
[19:20] steps after your teeth but there's no
[19:23] problem with understanding but the thing
[19:25] to get where we're at see the Lord Jesus
[19:27] was identified
[19:29] on the River Jordan
[19:31] this is my beloved Son in whom I'm
[19:33] pleased to dwell
[19:34] when you receive that new birth as it
[19:36] said a moment ago God says I'm pleased
[19:39] to dwell in you right amen I know I know
[19:42] what people are saying that you know I
[19:43] don't know about that maybe maybe no no
[19:47] if you have the new birth he's pleased
[19:49] to dwell in amen all right get it
[19:52] straight and run and run it the way it's
[19:54] supposed to be right amen he must be
[19:56] pleased to dwell in he dwelling in you
[19:57] if he wasn't pleased he wouldn't be that
[20:00] all right amen but see then that being
[20:02] as we'd say the River Jordan where it
[20:05] said this is my beloved Son of a woman
[20:06] pleased to dwell but now we're coming to
[20:09] hear ye him
[20:11] the coming to a place that we're like
[20:14] the Lord Jesus had reached a position
[20:17] that full Authority rested dark all
[20:21] right all right now and that man was
[20:24] full Authority because if you're going
[20:26] to get anything you're going to have to
[20:28] go from there okay now Mark's my point
[20:30] because I'm trying to get something to
[20:32] you tonight to to just you know help us
[20:35] to see where we're at all right all
[20:36] right now
[20:38] then after his amount of
[20:41] Transfiguration experience
[20:44] me
[20:45] it wasn't a lot said
[20:49] you go straight to Calvary on his way
[20:52] there he preaches six seals in Matthew
[20:54] 24. right
[20:56] amen all right he didn't preach that
[20:58] until after the anointing came on him on
[21:00] Mineral Transfiguration amen that's
[21:02] right he didn't preach that in his early
[21:04] Ministry he preached that there window
[21:07] when he had been adopted in other words
[21:09] amen all right now then if that be true
[21:13] why can't we parallel exactly
[21:15] oh
[21:16] me and to see that in the end time when
[21:20] brother Branham came to his place
[21:24] then he breaks six Fields all right
[21:27] he met the angels of the Lord
[21:30] taken up into the cloud
[21:33] and he says they didn't tell him
[21:34] anything back there he said they told
[21:36] him to come back
[21:38] and it would be told him and I was like
[21:40] told you he said
[21:42] I don't know what the first seal is well
[21:45] but if he did he was a liar right you
[21:48] know but you know people don't like for
[21:49] you to be that positive they want you to
[21:51] be flexible well I'm sorry I'm just like
[21:54] I am you know I just just sit on that
[21:57] basis to I believe it I believe and if
[22:01] you'll get it tonight you'll see what
[22:02] I'm talking about I believe the Lord
[22:04] Jesus Christ was adopted man of
[22:06] transfiguration that's right and then he
[22:08] preached the greatest messages he had
[22:10] ever preached right amen now
[22:13] you think about it though after his
[22:16] manner Transfiguration experience
[22:19] so that's where everybody thinks that
[22:20] that when you get an experience of a
[22:22] god-like amount of transfiguration I
[22:24] hear you him that boy you just gonna go
[22:26] out you're going to empty hospitals
[22:27] you're going to just do this you're
[22:29] going to turn the world upside down well
[22:31] it didn't happen with the Lord Jesus
[22:32] right right
[22:34] there were more miracles and signs and
[22:36] wonders in his early Ministry than it
[22:38] was in the last time
[22:41] more in the pot the Apostle Paul
[22:46] in his early Ministry than there was an
[22:48] end right because right around even
[22:50] refers to it and people would say Paul
[22:52] you used to be able to do this but since
[22:54] you looked like you've lost it yeah well
[22:56] see and look at brother random early
[22:59] Ministry great signs and wonders and
[23:02] healings going Every Which Way preaching
[23:04] to five hundred thousand seals break
[23:06] he's preaching the 30. all right
[23:09] right
[23:11] see it looked right reverse to what we
[23:14] think it ought to be well what are we
[23:16] expecting it to be with us then that's
[23:19] right amen
[23:20] I'm using only these as an example to
[23:23] compare brother's Ministry and the Lord
[23:25] Jesus Christ Ministry
[23:27] I said Ministry because I don't believe
[23:29] brother Brown was God right man no but
[23:32] God used the man
[23:34] to bring it if that spirit that was in
[23:37] sundering times in diverse manners was
[23:40] the spirit of Christ right then it was
[23:41] still using in brother Branham and he
[23:44] was not exalt in himself he was exalting
[23:46] God all right now see then in doing that
[23:51] foreign
[23:56] and look at the ministry back there and
[23:59] look at the ministry of brother random
[24:00] right all right
[24:03] and you see it coming right along
[24:05] together
[24:07] see odd birth you know very odd right
[24:10] I'm alive
[24:12] little mini street many preachers for
[24:15] quite a while
[24:16] and then God comes on the scene
[24:19] and the Lord Jesus and in the seals
[24:22] breaks and you know if we bring that the
[24:25] other day then the Commandments people
[24:28] don't they want the Commandments they
[24:29] think that's a bunch of rules it's not
[24:31] it's got the letter form the Bible is
[24:33] God in letter form in it we made it rude
[24:35] right amen we should yeah but it said
[24:38] God shall not kill well don't you think
[24:41] it ought to be right
[24:42] you want to go about be able to go kill
[24:44] and just get better you know not quite
[24:47] we're not supposed to be that way right
[24:49] but follow what I'm doing now let's look
[24:51] at it and see what happened there and
[24:54] see what happened down here with brother
[24:56] Branham but now I'm telling you
[24:59] are you listening
[25:01] those are only an example right
[25:05] for you and I am
[25:08] en well now I'm sitting back there you
[25:12] know I don't know all right remember a
[25:15] few weeks ago when I preached a little
[25:17] message on that people are looking back
[25:20] brother random said or they're looking
[25:22] forward and failing to see what's taking
[25:25] place all right that's the most
[25:28] denominational mix-up that could ever be
[25:30] see you you're looking back are you
[25:32] looking forward no look where we are now
[25:34] tomorrow's not here yet right that's why
[25:37] the Bible says today is the day of
[25:38] salvation amen right
[25:41] all right everything got to be present
[25:43] tense I thought we believed that that
[25:45] was what the word Elohim you know means
[25:47] self-existing but it means present tense
[25:49] right right here now
[25:51] all right see we're not talking about a
[25:52] god of yesterday amen that's a faith
[25:56] Builder Builder you know we look back we
[25:58] compare
[26:00] all right looking that away there's no
[26:02] faith in looking forward
[26:04] right how can there be any faith in
[26:06] looking forward
[26:10] now it can be revealed about the future
[26:12] home it can be where we're going and
[26:14] what we're doing but no I'm talking
[26:16] about the reveal word
[26:18] all right
[26:19] but see if we're to expect in the end
[26:22] time as we read dirt and kept giving the
[26:24] thing Sunday all day there about
[26:28] the ministry of Jesus Christ is to
[26:30] repeat in the bride amen that's right
[26:33] sure we can see it and run around them
[26:35] but where is it in the bride right
[26:38] it's got to be in the bride not just
[26:39] about guards him all right now look what
[26:42] both of those men done
[26:45] all right now I gave you a quote and I
[26:48] want to just just read the quote and
[26:50] then we'll we'll pick the point up
[26:53] uh
[26:54] yep
[26:55] number one on your notes positioned in
[26:57] Christ
[26:58] 1965-22 the morning service is that
[27:00] right waiting
[27:02] God trying to place his church in
[27:04] position to manifest himself
[27:06] getting one that he can work through
[27:08] like this say there's my spirit flowing
[27:11] freely there it is that that I I I I can
[27:15] work through get another one over here
[27:17] and place him
[27:20] I could place him adoption placing
[27:22] manifesting taking him out there and put
[27:25] a ceremony on him visit him with an
[27:28] Angel
[27:30] tell him something okay
[27:34] and he goes on telling about the
[27:35] manifestation of Sons and Daughters of
[27:37] God
[27:38] now what happened in the life of the
[27:40] Lord Jesus Christ
[27:43] and I said you have the experience of
[27:46] the River Jordan right
[27:48] right all right did he goes through life
[27:52] and you'll see every once in a while an
[27:53] angel appearing in things different with
[27:55] him you know in part like he was out in
[27:57] the quickest he got through with the
[27:59] baptism you know the scripture says he
[28:01] went out into the to the uh uh desert
[28:05] you know and was out there for 30 for 40
[28:07] days without water or food and you can't
[28:09] do that so it proved he had to be God
[28:11] you can't relax without water that long
[28:13] let a lot of food you know or anything
[28:16] else but
[28:18] see then the angels of God visited him
[28:21] and strengthened him
[28:23] all right
[28:25] now angels have always been
[28:28] connected to we'll get back to it in a
[28:31] few minutes now you know I preached a
[28:33] few months ago or I'm trying to look
[28:34] back and check if I could find it but
[28:36] maybe six months ago I don't know
[28:38] exactly we remember when I was preaching
[28:40] how the the angels of God are encamped
[28:43] about those who fear Him and they are
[28:46] ministering Spirits we'll get to it in a
[28:48] minute Hebrews 1 14-15 their ministering
[28:52] Spirits administering to the errors of
[28:54] Salvation all right get that in your
[28:56] mind now
[28:57] Angels ministering to the hearts of
[29:00] Salvation so you see Angels ministering
[29:02] to the Lord Jesus right right yes sir
[29:05] you see things happening through his
[29:07] life
[29:08] all right but then one day he goes and
[29:11] meets
[29:13] real Heavenly Angels doesn't he right
[29:17] because he was there with God on Mount
[29:18] Transfiguration
[29:20] he was there with Moses and Elias
[29:24] Angels Messengers right come to tell him
[29:27] something amen that's what we just read
[29:29] now take him out visit him with an angel
[29:33] tell him something
[29:34] all right see then the Lord Jesus went
[29:37] forth from there to preaching throughout
[29:39] the scriptures and then he comes up into
[29:42] Matthew 24 and he's preaching the seals
[29:45] and the things like that right right
[29:47] tonight do you see what I'm talking
[29:48] about the angels are there all the
[29:50] things are there all right what happened
[29:51] with brother random when he was born
[29:53] there was an angel with our Pillar of
[29:55] Fire Etc things happen all through his
[29:57] life an angel would speak to him he met
[30:00] the angel talked with the angels
[30:02] the Angels were related to him all the
[30:04] way through his ministry
[30:06] not after he got away on down all the
[30:08] way through his ministry the angel of
[30:10] God was there with him to tell him the
[30:13] things that you know I'm sure now you
[30:16] know yourself he calls it holy spirit
[30:17] sometimes so we preached on that right
[30:20] but if that's why it says the angel
[30:22] singular of God in campus about those
[30:25] who fear Him it doesn't say angels He
[30:27] said Angel singular because you take all
[30:30] the Angels you bring them together for
[30:31] their job they're doing and what have
[30:33] you got the Holy Spirit
[30:35] right right which is the angel of God
[30:38] that's why all born-again believers have
[30:40] the angel of an Angel right but I
[30:43] believe you have an angel besides just
[30:45] having the holy spirit amen all right
[30:47] but she brought a random Meats with that
[30:49] angel all kind of thing happens to his
[30:51] life
[30:53] but then one day he's told to go to
[30:55] Tucson Arizona because of a dream right
[30:58] right and he met with seven angels huh
[31:02] and when he got there he
[31:05] said the one
[31:07] next to him in other words the seventh
[31:10] angel you're going down reading this in
[31:12] the quote number three see
[31:17] number two he's telling how he's out
[31:19] there and he says that you know
[31:20] concentrate yourself because of the
[31:21] visitation of these angels
[31:24] because they were coming then he goes
[31:25] down into the seal book I gave it to you
[31:27] seven still not uh 50 uh five six
[31:30] through the seal book
[31:31] 324 to 60 1963.
[31:35] he said he took me up to it he looked
[31:39] more to me than any of the rest
[31:41] that one angel will see the seven angel
[31:44] had to do with him all right so now what
[31:47] are we having what are we talking about
[31:50] comparing what happened with the Lord
[31:52] Jesus
[31:53] with what happened
[31:56] we brought around
[31:58] you follow that compassion
[32:01] all kind of things where you can just go
[32:03] and spend days and days and days
[32:04] preaching about the things in comparison
[32:07] of what would was taking place
[32:10] and see that would be then coming out to
[32:13] be the one to where that
[32:16] we had an angel
[32:18] all right now all born again Believers
[32:21] the prophet said has an angel
[32:25] he said he's assigned to you
[32:28] when you're born right because he knows
[32:33] he knows who's going to receive the Holy
[32:36] Ghost right right sure choice not to
[32:38] just say quote the Holy Ghost
[32:42] it's an angel of God
[32:44] all right Hebrews 1 and I said 14 15
[32:48] says that those angels are what
[32:50] ministering spirits
[32:52] to minister unto
[32:56] the children of God right
[33:00] and we can look back and we can compare
[33:02] brother random the Lord Jesus but what
[33:05] about you and I amen
[33:08] that's right what about you and me well
[33:11] you know or we could just look at and
[33:13] compare things and and talk about what
[33:16] was
[33:18] or one of these days it will be
[33:22] well just remember
[33:23] if there was or was
[33:26] that's not good language I guess it gets
[33:28] a point across but if there was it was
[33:31] the one had to be speaking of the right
[33:33] now right
[33:36] man yeah right all right so we look back
[33:39] and we draw faith
[33:41] from what was behind yep to be able to
[33:45] walk in where we are now
[33:47] okay all right
[33:49] then and only then when we see it
[33:53] present tense can we even think of a
[33:56] future right
[33:58] but you see we want to jump from back
[34:00] there to go over there
[34:02] it doesn't work that way man me we we've
[34:07] got to have something here now all right
[34:09] okay I believe
[34:12] that according to what the prophet is
[34:14] telling us the Lord Jesus was adopted on
[34:16] the Mount of transfiguration that's
[34:18] right amen all right then he went forth
[34:20] and preached the seals
[34:22] I believe brother random was adopted in
[34:24] 1963 when the Angels met him out there
[34:27] right
[34:28] and then he came back and proven it
[34:30] because he came back and preached the
[34:32] seals the same identical comparison as
[34:34] the ministry of Christ now I wrote it
[34:36] like this don't do what you won't do
[34:38] yeah
[34:39] do people say but I believe brother
[34:41] Brown was adopted in his early Ministry
[34:43] what what early when
[34:46] yeah bring me scriptures or anything to
[34:50] compare it
[34:52] he said when he had great signs and
[34:54] wonders what show did the Lord Jesus how
[34:57] signs and wonders before his Mount of
[34:59] transfiguration right
[35:01] right I just got to say that you agreed
[35:04] see you didn't know where I'm going so
[35:05] it'd probably be better not to shake
[35:07] your head in the great women sometimes
[35:08] you know
[35:09] because I I'm going on down the road huh
[35:13] and I know doing that a lot of times you
[35:14] just stop because you you're afraid you
[35:16] know well why are you before are you
[35:17] afraid
[35:19] that's right is it true
[35:22] that brought around his ministry in the
[35:24] Lord Jesus comparison exactly absolutely
[35:26] amen
[35:28] that might run around me and say it may
[35:30] start something right
[35:33] but you said and I wrote it this way so
[35:35] you can do it I'm not going to argue
[35:36] with you about any point I told you
[35:39] brother uh brother up in the Tennessee
[35:41] lost a family because he preached this
[35:45] it wrote around was adopted in 63 when
[35:48] the angel of the Lord come into it and
[35:50] and a family left him because we don't
[35:54] know where he was adopted today
[35:57] well you agree he was adopted
[36:01] well everybody here agreed run around
[36:03] and was adopted
[36:06] now somebody's shaking head someone's
[36:08] saying amen and somebody's just looking
[36:09] so I guess a good stern look means amen
[36:12] this means no so I don't get any of that
[36:15] all right now you get the point
[36:17] right
[36:23] John where the Lord Jesus was adopted
[36:26] and according to the Bible we can read
[36:28] it perfectly where he was called The
[36:29] Prophet said that was his adoption
[36:31] amount of transfiguration amen
[36:33] amen well I think comparison of brother
[36:35] Randy's Ministry see the Angels come to
[36:38] the Lord Jesus Moses and Elias and what
[36:41] were they doing
[36:43] Messengers come to the Lord Jesus they
[36:45] were telling him about his second coming
[36:47] that's right amen
[36:50] Matthew 24 you know I mean Matthew 17
[36:53] when it comes to that and we're telling
[36:55] him about his second coming right
[36:57] huh
[36:58] well see then when when brother random
[37:01] met the angels of the Lord what was they
[37:03] talking about
[37:04] he said the one with the seventh seal he
[37:06] said that is his coming
[37:09] well it's still compare
[37:12] but it see it ain't gonna
[37:15] it ain't gonna well we are no means have
[37:17] arguing the point of where it just
[37:19] happened where that happened
[37:21] it happened right
[37:25] well if I just don't like your attitude
[37:28] because we don't know where to happen
[37:30] well you don't either
[37:34] you just said it
[37:36] but when I argue the point
[37:38] I'm comparing it but after all that said
[37:42] and done if you was right and I was
[37:44] wrong and I was right and you were the
[37:45] wrong word that make anything right
[37:49] come on
[37:52] the only way that we know what happened
[37:54] to brother random and to happen to the
[37:57] Lord Jesus is it's got to happen to you
[37:59] and I right amen now if it don't we
[38:02] don't know whether that be true or not
[38:03] we're looking back right and to remember
[38:06] that's three unclean spirits like frogs
[38:08] because frogs look what backward all
[38:12] right
[38:12] they don't even look forward they
[38:15] disappointing amen but now listen
[38:17] see
[38:20] there was more signs in the early part
[38:23] of the Lord Jesus's Ministry than in the
[38:25] last part
[38:26] there was more signs than brother
[38:28] Brown's early Ministry than there was in
[38:30] the life's part of his ministry right
[38:32] that's right
[38:35] and then when you get down to what he
[38:37] would call in the third pool remember
[38:39] there's a quote where he says
[38:42] I believe all of them people was healed
[38:46] he said because the Bible says it but he
[38:50] said take that little girl
[38:54] to the doctor and he said I guarantee
[38:56] you healing we call that the third pull
[39:00] we don't only happen on the spring list
[39:03] yeah right right
[39:06] it didn't happen ever service did it
[39:08] right come on right but they were sick
[39:10] healed and dead raised and stuff like
[39:11] that almost every service okay
[39:14] but he never spoke of it as the third
[39:15] Pope
[39:17] me that's why the Lord Jesus when he
[39:19] come down to it and he went to Calvary
[39:22] when he was in the garden
[39:24] right he prayed through and he yielded
[39:27] to the father and he said okay it's over
[39:29] with
[39:30] I'm through I'm you know whatever you
[39:33] want me to do it's done
[39:36] in very few words with said afternoon
[39:40] until even pilate referred to it
[39:43] that word ain't you gonna talk to me
[39:45] don't you know that I have power to set
[39:48] you free what'd he say
[39:51] he said the only Power you have is what
[39:54] my father gives you
[39:57] you didn't argue did he all right he
[40:01] didn't scream and holler
[40:03] I see people doing that trying to cast
[40:05] out demons demons love screaming and
[40:07] hollering you ain't gonna scream and
[40:09] holler a demon out
[40:11] you just speak the word
[40:13] take that and move on with it all right
[40:17] but watch now
[40:19] the reason I speak
[40:22] of these things to you tonight
[40:25] about the the way the Lord Jesus
[40:28] experienced this and the way that
[40:29] brother Reynolds experiences and how
[40:31] they come Empire it's because it will
[40:34] compare
[40:37] comparancy
[40:38] then come in Jesus leaving Mount of
[40:41] transfiguration
[40:43] he's going towards Calvary and receiving
[40:47] the complete revelation of the opening
[40:50] of the word and he preached it in
[40:52] Matthew 24.
[40:56] brother Branham the things he was doing
[40:59] and then he comes forth after the
[41:02] visitation of the Angels
[41:05] and he comes forward
[41:08] and preaches the seals
[41:11] and each Ministry that starts tapering
[41:13] off
[41:15] right
[41:18] I mean is that what it looks like
[41:21] what all right now
[41:24] what are we talking about
[41:27] me he preached the seals he met the
[41:31] angels
[41:33] he come back preaching the Sea of have
[41:35] you met the angel of the god that's
[41:36] right because according to what I just
[41:39] read now
[41:41] you want to reread it again
[41:46] get another one here positioned in
[41:48] Christ where we started 5 22 in the
[41:50] morning service adoption place it
[41:52] manifested himself out here and put a
[41:54] ceremony on him Vision with an angel
[41:56] tell him something now if he's told the
[41:59] truth
[42:00] what now he if he's just making up
[42:03] something it won't work no no that won't
[42:06] work
[42:08] we've had a lot of that right but I mean
[42:10] but I mean manifestations of sons of God
[42:16] when God manifests himself and sends him
[42:19] out and then he goes forth and what he
[42:22] says is true what he does is the truth
[42:25] what he does he manifests Christ how do
[42:28] you how do you judge him how do you
[42:31] judge any person
[42:33] more than I look him in the eyes my eyes
[42:35] judge your spirits you know
[42:38] they don't judge Spirits by looking now
[42:40] you judge it was just right here what
[42:41] the prophet said
[42:42] how do you judge him by the way he stays
[42:46] with the word all right
[42:48] right with the word see
[42:51] that's how you know all men is by the
[42:54] way he stays with the word all right
[42:57] so now Hebrews we're back to that 1 14
[43:00] 15.
[43:04] we've had an angel
[43:07] I wrote around him right
[43:10] let's have a church age Mission you're
[43:12] an angel all right if you if you have
[43:15] the new birth
[43:17] you have the Holy Spirit which is an
[43:19] angel of God
[43:20] in manifestation and can be used that
[43:23] way and you also the prophet of God said
[43:25] if you need this send me a letter I'll
[43:27] be glad to send them to you he said ever
[43:30] born again Christian has an angel
[43:35] now has your angel taken you out and
[43:38] told you anything
[43:43] if it happened with the Lord Jesus
[43:45] and it happened with brother Brown
[43:48] don't you think it'll happen year in the
[43:50] end time with you and I
[43:53] am
[43:54] that's all I'm doing that's just simple
[43:56] as I'm making it this you know everybody
[43:58] said brother that was so deep where is
[43:59] that so deep that what is the point of d
[44:03] it's just comparing the things and then
[44:06] saying that it's not for us to just sit
[44:09] down and say look what we've had
[44:13] wonderful what we've had
[44:16] but God is not the god of the head come
[44:19] on Amen he's the god of the living amen
[44:24] bye
[44:26] has he taken you out and visited you
[44:28] with an angel all right
[44:30] told you something for the people
[44:36] now yours were
[44:38] you know we're gonna go for a little
[44:40] while all right so you go ahead and go
[44:42] sleep and forget the rest of the message
[44:45] because we're gonna get personal
[44:48] now as he visited you with an Angel
[44:52] all right now that's your own experience
[44:55] right amen now what he visited brother
[44:57] Branham is not my experience right right
[45:00] but what he's visited me is not your
[45:03] experience all right amen everybody got
[45:06] me and what I'm saying
[45:08] yeah has he visited you
[45:11] all right because I believe when The
[45:13] Headstone comes to the individual
[45:16] that that means God himself stepped on
[45:19] the scene in that individual right
[45:23] amen
[45:25] you met you
[45:30] see anything you're going to say brother
[45:31] they all you just trying to do okay quit
[45:33] do what you don't do this all right with
[45:34] me
[45:37] but you see I told you this what 40
[45:39] years ago
[45:41] so it ain't something I hatched up
[45:44] okay
[45:46] anybody want to get up here and walk up
[45:48] and tell how many times brother Dale has
[45:49] seen an angel in his home
[45:51] somebody tell me how many times
[45:54] three times okay
[46:01] he said what did he tell you anything no
[46:04] I told you what I done the first time I
[46:07] seen it I grabbed my pistol and took off
[46:08] later oh it was real
[46:10] it was not a fugitive of my imagination
[46:13] my imagination don't play games
[46:15] I never was a drunk that seen a thick
[46:17] elephant
[46:19] they're the same I've always had the
[46:21] same mind
[46:23] and when I saw that man standing in my
[46:25] bedroom door I took a pistol one
[46:27] afternoon that's how real it was
[46:31] but the next two times I seen it I seen
[46:33] it again right after them
[46:36] and then I seen after we moved to where
[46:38] we live now I always wondered had I
[46:40] moved at the wrong place because where
[46:42] I'd seen an angel before
[46:44] and I woke up one night and I looked up
[46:46] there and I know the difference in a
[46:47] dream in a leery world were you in
[46:50] between the two
[46:56] but you see he didn't tell me
[47:03] so that's not going to make anything out
[47:04] of me
[47:07] it's just telling you that it can happen
[47:10] he ran around said God let some people
[47:13] have these experiences where they could
[47:14] tell others
[47:16] I just tell you what I'm saying I told
[47:19] you that when I was about 10 11 years
[47:20] old that I saw God at a church standing
[47:23] there
[47:24] now the Hoffman's head across not a
[47:26] figure I couldn't tell you how much you
[47:27] weighed what it was I just saw him
[47:29] standing there and I knew it I wanted to
[47:31] see that God
[47:32] and all my Christian experience I wanted
[47:34] somebody to tell me about that God I saw
[47:37] and I couldn't find it I talked to the
[47:39] Baptist people about it and they say all
[47:40] you need to do just go you need to go to
[47:42] a Pentecostal Church you know and get in
[47:44] with a movement of The Spirit Well I
[47:46] what I didn't know it was I would have
[47:47] went I guess
[47:49] but
[47:51] I tried
[47:53] I walked into church one day where we
[47:55] used to go to church about four and a
[47:57] half not too long
[47:59] the doors were locked everything was
[48:01] closed up
[48:02] I walked in
[48:06] and there's a man walking around the
[48:08] basement
[48:09] the doors were all locked I unlocked I
[48:13] was the one that got there first
[48:15] I generally do it here
[48:17] and I opened the doors and went in he
[48:19] was in the basement
[48:20] I said good to see you sir he said oh
[48:22] I'm just traveling down the road
[48:26] I gotta go though I should want to hang
[48:27] around we'll be having services in a
[48:29] little while he said no I said you
[48:31] stopped incident and I got no
[48:33] no well
[48:34] I said okay I'll go in the out the door
[48:36] you know
[48:37] he went out the door he walked down and
[48:39] he walked down and walked to the highway
[48:40] walking towards Gainesville
[48:43] well it's kind of odd that's the way we
[48:44] went when we found this message
[48:46] you know all them you can say well you
[48:49] just doing this doing that and I'm just
[48:50] telling you the truth I'm asking you a
[48:52] question
[48:52] has God met you
[48:55] that's right
[49:00] now you can't deny this one
[49:04] and I wasn't in no cave I wasn't in no
[49:07] healed I wasn't in no Duets because I'm
[49:09] not made that away
[49:10] God has spoke to me when I was out in
[49:12] the woods but he spoke to me and when he
[49:15] spoke to me about those seals and showed
[49:17] me how they broke
[49:20] I was running a job at General Motors
[49:23] that nobody couldn't run when I was out
[49:28] it was so fast
[49:30] they would have to put a man and a half
[49:31] at least under that job that day
[49:35] it was so fast
[49:38] and yet the Lord is right there opened
[49:40] no sealed up to me and began to show me
[49:45] and make running a job that a man could
[49:47] not run it for 15 minutes for me to go
[49:50] take a break 16 in the afternoon
[49:53] I'd have to help him out as we called it
[49:55] getting behind you know going down the
[49:57] line called it getting in the hole well
[50:00] then back up before he could leave and
[50:02] go on to another
[50:05] but the Lord came one day and visited me
[50:09] and he told me about the opening of the
[50:11] seals
[50:15] and it stands till today
[50:21] never had anybody challenge you
[50:25] it stands till today
[50:28] probably a lot of people wanted to but
[50:32] they knew they couldn't handle it
[50:35] because it was too much of what the
[50:36] prophet had said because there's no
[50:39] honor that this man ever been given all
[50:40] of the honor I give Mr brother promise
[50:43] Ministry message
[50:45] he was not God
[50:48] but God used that man
[50:50] right to speak
[50:54] and now for 20 something 30 years ago
[50:57] today that was 79
[51:01] and then I preached him in 82 over again
[51:04] in 1979 I preached it
[51:08] and tried to bring Christ to you
[51:12] that's all I've ever tried to pray
[51:15] yeah I fully believe what brother
[51:16] Reynolds said
[51:18] you go to Christ the mystery he said if
[51:20] you miss it in them seals he said come
[51:22] back to this message that's what he said
[51:25] he didn't say go back read The Shield
[51:27] book again which that's what we need to
[51:28] do I need to do that now
[51:31] we should come after this message Christ
[51:33] the mystery
[51:34] because there was the mystery Christ
[51:37] that's what he revealed to me was Christ
[51:41] and just working I mean working a job
[51:44] and I'm not you know you can ask these
[51:45] these brothers they were there yeah the
[51:48] jobs that I ran
[51:50] they actually on that job they were told
[51:52] to load me and fire me
[51:55] my supervisor told me finally
[51:58] he said the more work I put on you the
[52:00] better job you've done
[52:02] and they finally backed off
[52:04] got afraid
[52:07] and they backed up and gave me good jobs
[52:11] I think because they seemed that I was
[52:13] honest and sincere
[52:16] but yet the Lord come down and spoke to
[52:18] me and showed me how to what your stands
[52:21] alone the first seal
[52:23] here stands a lamb with a book in his
[52:26] hand he said there goes your white horse
[52:27] rider
[52:28] so look at that fella riding off look at
[52:31] that guy going the other way because if
[52:33] you ever see two people in the Bible
[52:35] you can't have two Lords that won't work
[52:38] if there's two people in the Bible one
[52:40] of them's the devil and one of God
[52:43] because God is not too personal amen
[52:46] he's one God
[52:49] so then the prophet of God go to the
[52:51] first shield and look at it he said here
[52:52] stands a lamb with the book of his name
[52:54] there it goes that white horse rider he
[52:55] said thereby it could not be the holy
[52:57] spirit that he even used to think and
[52:59] preach that it was
[53:01] but he said it's got to be the
[53:02] Antichrist
[53:04] well the Lord revealed that to me and
[53:06] that stood now for 30 something years
[53:11] well see that's what I don't understand
[53:17] to you ministers out there to be
[53:19] listening or even ministers here or
[53:20] whatever
[53:22] does God ever come down and visit did
[53:24] you
[53:27] tell you something
[53:30] now I hope you understand what I was
[53:32] saying I didn't account the three times
[53:34] I seen
[53:36] but I didn't count even the person I saw
[53:39] standing in a church when I was 11 years
[53:40] old
[53:42] I never counted none of those as a new
[53:44] birth or anything
[53:46] I just tell what I saw
[53:51] and see humble people out there they
[53:53] they say oh he's just making this up
[53:55] well there's plenty of people sitting
[53:56] right here in the building that'll
[53:58] verify that I've told this 40 years ago
[54:01] right so I don't have to prop it up now
[54:04] and I'm not breaking except on Jesus
[54:06] Christ
[54:08] but why has the ministers around the
[54:10] message are scared of the seals
[54:12] are they afraid to preach
[54:15] why are they afraid to preach like the
[54:18] prophet of God said
[54:20] if you don't understand Daniel 70 weeks
[54:22] you're going to miss it in the seals
[54:24] right then he said that in Daniel's 70
[54:27] weeks look
[54:30] but yet who understands Daniel 70 weeks
[54:34] or if anybody even preaches on Daniel 7
[54:36] units but he said if you don't
[54:38] understand it you mentioned it
[54:41] I wouldn't want to make those quotes
[54:45] but you see about 1973 I began to study
[54:50] and the Lord opened that Daniel 70 weeks
[54:53] up to me
[54:54] and I preached it
[54:56] and I say again it stood the test
[54:59] because it's never been tackled publicly
[55:02] big
[55:04] and won't tackle it
[55:05] because I don't understand really
[55:09] but yet it still stands to date I
[55:11] believe same thing I did except for 1973
[55:13] said before
[55:17] see church I've not tried to bring to
[55:19] you my
[55:21] human
[55:23] I've tried to bring Christ to you
[55:27] I try to stay even away from telling you
[55:30] about things that would take place
[55:35] because I don't want it built on that
[55:37] that's right
[55:40] oh it's all built on Jesus Christ
[55:43] yeah
[55:45] but where do you see anybody see
[55:48] all right come on man
[55:52] sure oh yeah we preach on it we preach
[55:55] on it
[55:57] who wants to preach
[56:00] well I'm not a teacher like you
[56:02] if you're a powerful Ministry person
[56:05] with the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[56:07] you're supposed to have the Holy Ghost
[56:09] and a Ministry and that Ministry is
[56:12] supposed to be capable of teaching and
[56:14] the capacity of your ministry
[56:17] sure absolutely amen but of course we
[56:19] like to go to Christ the mystery God
[56:20] reveal we're brought around and says
[56:22] said the teachers who want to miss it
[56:24] but they don't see they they just don't
[56:26] throw it off on the teacher they don't
[56:27] want to
[56:29] I agree the teachers have missed it
[56:35] well I'm just telling you
[56:38] God met me and told me and I've come
[56:41] told you about it
[56:43] 30 years ago
[56:47] and it still stands today of course I'm
[56:49] not very popular but
[56:54] there's no problem neither was the Lord
[56:56] Jesus and neither was brought around
[56:59] and brother random gun over a pretty
[57:01] started on that sell it see like it
[57:02] really heard what he said
[57:04] now he was just trying to explain Jesus
[57:06] Christ right do you agree you believe
[57:10] that brother Branham all he was doing
[57:11] through the seals and all was just
[57:12] explaining Jesus Christ trying to show
[57:14] Jesus Christ you agree with that you
[57:16] know what he said
[57:18] he said thousands of my friends believe
[57:20] me
[57:25] because he's trying to explain Jesus
[57:27] Christ
[57:30] they couldn't argue about the gift
[57:33] they wouldn't argue or cry in any way to
[57:36] attack the angel
[57:40] they said oh while he's well he's
[57:43] praying for the sick while he's doing
[57:44] this he's a prophet but said when he
[57:46] starts preaching the word
[57:54] but you see the prophet of God said
[57:56] there's no perfect faith I think I gave
[57:58] it to you in one of the yeah number four
[58:00] and you know you become the word as you
[58:03] receive the word
[58:04] that's right
[58:06] how can you become the worker oh I was
[58:08] born third
[58:09] now not according to what the prophet
[58:11] says on number five on your notes from
[58:13] who is this melchized
[58:16] who is this Melchizedek wrote around and
[58:18] said you bypassed the word he said Jesus
[58:21] came the word he said you pie past the
[58:23] word yep
[58:25] but he said you become the word here
[58:30] if we become the word here
[58:32] the Lord Jesus was born to work amen
[58:37] all right but we bypassed it do we have
[58:40] to become the word here
[58:42] and to do that it means we must have the
[58:45] new birth
[58:47] hey look what he says then we become the
[58:50] word here we are formed to the word
[58:52] image to be a partaker of the word feed
[58:56] on the word by being that here's the
[58:59] problem predestinated since the
[59:01] beginning you see that little speck part
[59:04] of life that laid in you from the
[59:06] beginning when you started your journey
[59:09] right
[59:15] a little representation of
[59:17] predestination is what he said the
[59:18] little woman that dwell had right
[59:21] one time he calls it representation from
[59:24] predestination the other time he called
[59:26] the representation by predestination
[59:32] what you see
[59:34] like I told you back a few weeks ago
[59:36] months or so ago
[59:39] there's a predestinated word the word is
[59:42] what comes predestinated is not the
[59:44] people comes predestinated eternally
[59:45] from God right you remember the quotes
[59:47] in the church age book right it's the
[59:50] person not the person that comes with
[59:52] it's the cedar word there's a word for
[59:54] every age I preach two or about two
[59:56] sermons on that
[59:58] a word a seed for every age Martin
[1:00:01] Luther was the just shall live by faith
[1:00:07] that's right but yeah they made it a
[1:00:09] Reformation
[1:00:11] because even he tried to reform the
[1:00:13] Church but the message he brought was
[1:00:15] restoration
[1:00:17] amen
[1:00:20] but it turned into Reformation
[1:00:22] which you and I can't be in in
[1:00:24] Reformation anymore we've got to be in
[1:00:26] Total Restoration because the Bible says
[1:00:29] the restitution which is the word
[1:00:30] restore
[1:00:32] right all things
[1:00:36] even broke it down for you there a
[1:00:38] message or so ago that Joel says it that
[1:00:40] it's to restore what has fallen away
[1:00:44] Joy is speaking of the church ages
[1:00:46] because it's like the canker wearing
[1:00:47] pong worms Locust and the caterpillar
[1:00:49] ate down right
[1:00:51] the brother round did come just to
[1:00:52] restore the ages he come to restore all
[1:00:55] the words that's right
[1:01:00] even marriage and divorce all the things
[1:01:02] he preached after then where did he say
[1:01:04] it was revealed at he said the Rapture
[1:01:06] was revealed in them seals
[1:01:11] that's what he says amen
[1:01:16] see because the shield is the entire
[1:01:17] word of God amen amen
[1:01:20] and if God if he's come on the scene
[1:01:24] and give us the revelation of the word
[1:01:29] then what are we looking for
[1:01:32] right
[1:01:38] what are we looking for to happen
[1:01:42] well if we had that we'd be we'd just be
[1:01:44] we'd be going we'd be with it wouldn't
[1:01:47] be a certain person Among Us
[1:01:49] you know whose fault the prophet said it
[1:01:51] is the reason is the sick people among
[1:01:52] us
[1:01:53] now you want him
[1:01:55] what did he say was the reason that
[1:01:57] there's six people among us he said
[1:01:58] because there's people among us that are
[1:02:00] not right right
[1:02:03] he said one unconfessed sin in a church
[1:02:07] will cause the whole church to fail
[1:02:09] that's right amen and you will have to
[1:02:12] bitterly answer he says quote the rest
[1:02:15] of it
[1:02:18] so then whose fault is it that God's not
[1:02:20] among us
[1:02:21] God has brought his word that's what I'm
[1:02:23] trying to get you to see I'm not trying
[1:02:25] to exalt anything other than Jesus
[1:02:27] Christ that's right amen amen
[1:02:29] The Compassion of the Lord Jesus The
[1:02:32] Compassion of the brother wrath and the
[1:02:34] compassion to me and you
[1:02:38] like he said but brother Dale he's never
[1:02:40] met me with an angel no he didn't stop a
[1:02:42] line at General Motors
[1:02:44] he didn't send down a great Pillar of
[1:02:46] Fire and holler at me and tell me all
[1:02:48] about it he was an inward thoughts that
[1:02:50] was coming that I was writing down
[1:02:53] I can only write two or three words
[1:02:55] because of the speed of the job I was
[1:02:57] running
[1:02:59] and I know you ain't gonna understand
[1:03:01] this one
[1:03:03] man I thought God if this is true
[1:03:08] if what you're showing me is true
[1:03:11] there's no way for me to break it or
[1:03:13] stop it
[1:03:16] I turned around and told a man on the
[1:03:18] other side of the line a joke
[1:03:19] not a dirty joke I don't believe in them
[1:03:22] I told him a joke
[1:03:25] we laughed
[1:03:29] and I turned around and picked up my pen
[1:03:31] and caught the job run like crazy picked
[1:03:34] the pin up and started writing again it
[1:03:35] was just perfectly Right Down the Line
[1:03:38] never even a gap in the wording
[1:03:40] remember the old manifest that was on
[1:03:42] the jobs you know they had to have them
[1:03:44] where you could keep up with it you
[1:03:45] remember the other day the manifestation
[1:03:48] yeah I'd rip off those manifests and lay
[1:03:50] down on the table upside down because it
[1:03:51] wouldn't have written on the backside
[1:03:52] and I'd write a few notes and I put them
[1:03:54] in my pocket and write a few notes my
[1:03:56] wife now she finds little pieces of
[1:03:58] paper laying on my desk or anywhere in
[1:03:59] my clothes she takes somebody puts them
[1:04:01] up because she knows it means or
[1:04:02] something
[1:04:07] everybody thinks though just got to be
[1:04:09] that the Lord's just going to approach
[1:04:10] this he's just going to be there with
[1:04:11] you and the end of this will be all day
[1:04:13] long
[1:04:14] listen to a man one day telling about it
[1:04:17] I ain't making fun of him his business
[1:04:19] between him and God but he said the Lord
[1:04:21] told him more to fish and he said no
[1:04:23] Lord I'm going to fish over here in this
[1:04:24] deep water
[1:04:25] so the Lord said no fish over here and
[1:04:27] he said no I'm going to fish over here
[1:04:28] it's just an argument for a long time
[1:04:30] now I don't believe that that's right
[1:04:34] but he did say fish thought of her and
[1:04:36] caught some fish what the Lord told him
[1:04:38] so that's between him and the Lord
[1:04:40] now you're saying God don't play games
[1:04:44] when he comes he comes sometimes and he
[1:04:47] just speaks one word
[1:04:51] well if he'd just give me a word that's
[1:04:52] all I need I don't need a whole page
[1:04:57] I was wondering how to follow this
[1:04:58] tonight in the correct order
[1:05:00] walking around down in the basement tell
[1:05:02] a while ago and I said Lord I need just
[1:05:04] a little bit more I know what I want to
[1:05:06] say but I need a little bit more he said
[1:05:08] what you've been preaching about the
[1:05:09] angels
[1:05:13] that their ministering Spirit sent
[1:05:15] forward to minister into the errors of
[1:05:17] salvation
[1:05:19] that's all it needs
[1:05:22] that's all I needed
[1:05:25] okay yep all right
[1:05:27] has God visited you with an Angel
[1:05:32] I'm telling you you're looking for
[1:05:35] something you see out there some great
[1:05:37] Halo some light something speaking to
[1:05:39] you and God can do that
[1:05:41] and has done that with people right
[1:05:46] but what about that steel Small Voice
[1:05:49] amen that's right I thought that was
[1:05:52] what attracted The Prophet's attention
[1:05:55] it wasn't a great loud Thunders and the
[1:05:57] Lightnings and the winds and the things
[1:05:59] and you know that God appeared in every
[1:06:01] one of those things in Bible terminology
[1:06:03] he appeared in the Thunders he appeared
[1:06:05] in the in the lightning he appeared in
[1:06:07] the Wind
[1:06:08] right
[1:06:10] but none of those brought the prophet
[1:06:12] out of the cave
[1:06:13] and then it's kind of odd too isn't it
[1:06:17] looked like he won't stay in there
[1:06:21] when he heard a steel small voice
[1:06:28] hey if you ever hear him don't worry
[1:06:29] about it you can't stay in the cave
[1:06:31] either all right amen
[1:06:33] people around the country you you do it
[1:06:35] a lot of you you you're gonna deny
[1:06:37] you'll be saying this and when I get to
[1:06:39] of Google quit saying anything about it
[1:06:42] but you're not going to think that God
[1:06:44] has been with us
[1:06:47] you're going to think if it was we would
[1:06:49] see this and we would see that and why
[1:06:50] haven't we seen this because of you
[1:06:53] is that enough amen
[1:06:57] I told you I'll make it blunt it's
[1:06:59] because of you and your unbelief and I'm
[1:07:02] looking over the congregation and I
[1:07:04] ain't seemingly not one person that's
[1:07:05] right
[1:07:08] it's our unbelief is what's called amen
[1:07:11] that's right amen
[1:07:12] you don't believe God had been with us
[1:07:15] come on
[1:07:17] may I quote right around
[1:07:19] we can't go into desperation God has to
[1:07:22] bring us to desperation but what we have
[1:07:25] seen in Lula Georgia for 40 years
[1:07:28] I want to throw us into desperation
[1:07:32] because we haven't had to to back off of
[1:07:35] any of these doctrines and things that's
[1:07:36] went around the country that's right the
[1:07:39] two souls are selling Thunder versus
[1:07:40] Perugia son of man
[1:07:42] forever Jordan
[1:07:43] 's just two Lords all these things it
[1:07:45] hasn't taken us the word that we've got
[1:07:47] caught in the junk
[1:07:48] that's right but you don't think is an
[1:07:50] honor of that you don't think
[1:07:53] oh it's just your intellect brother
[1:07:55] you've been stubborn that's why
[1:08:00] did you mean that
[1:08:02] did you mean it was just my stubbornness
[1:08:04] well then I'd make my stubbornness
[1:08:06] better than your Holy Ghost because
[1:08:07] evidently your Holy Ghost ain't been
[1:08:09] able to keep you out of Doctrine
[1:08:13] is that enough
[1:08:17] you mean my stubbornness has kept me out
[1:08:20] and you went after those jokes
[1:08:22] and I'm not just preaching out there
[1:08:24] most people says you know brother he had
[1:08:26] that way of doing he lean on the pulpit
[1:08:28] to point at the microphone he said I'm
[1:08:29] talking about I'll tell him I ain't
[1:08:30] talking about out there
[1:08:32] I'm talking about here
[1:08:36] now watch out there I can hear
[1:08:40] it's been made available
[1:08:45] but yet people have drove a house
[1:08:47] somebody that's predicted 14 times and
[1:08:49] everyone have been wrong and each time
[1:08:51] they'd say this is thus saith the Lord
[1:08:54] when uh something happened wrong
[1:08:55] somewhere
[1:08:57] and we read the Bible the other day
[1:08:59] where what you're supposed to do that
[1:09:00] kind of person yeah
[1:09:03] right
[1:09:04] to my Prop Shop like supposed to kill
[1:09:06] him
[1:09:07] all right of course the government won't
[1:09:09] let us
[1:09:10] and I wouldn't want to either because
[1:09:11] I'm a Christian
[1:09:13] so what do you do
[1:09:15] you say brother Dale now don't say the
[1:09:17] rest what you fixing to say I am going
[1:09:19] to say it too I'll do my best to kill
[1:09:21] the influence
[1:09:22] you say you kill a man you kill him you
[1:09:25] kill his influence you killed a man
[1:09:27] don't play garbage with me
[1:09:30] you mean I'm supposed to Pat the pope on
[1:09:32] the back and brother we agree with
[1:09:35] everything you say
[1:09:38] I can't speak against you
[1:09:41] cause I'm a Christian
[1:09:45] Martin Luther said they said Martin
[1:09:47] Luther the world is against you he said
[1:09:49] then you let the world know I'm against
[1:09:51] them
[1:09:52] amen that's it you kill a man you kill
[1:09:56] his influence I'm trying my best to kill
[1:09:59] the influence the devil's got on your
[1:10:01] mind and mine that's right I've been
[1:10:04] doing that for 40 something years trying
[1:10:06] to kill that influence that Devil's got
[1:10:07] on you and I and I'll try my best to
[1:10:10] kill it until the day I die that's right
[1:10:13] amen trying my best to cleanse you and I
[1:10:16] with the word because what does what if
[1:10:18] I told you over and over how can you
[1:10:19] ever have anything in God how do you get
[1:10:21] the statue of perfect man how do you get
[1:10:23] the virtues of God Only by the revealed
[1:10:26] word that's right amen all right
[1:10:29] you can't you can't manufacture it you
[1:10:32] can't prop it up all right that's right
[1:10:34] but when God reveals a word he comes
[1:10:37] down and just speaks he just adds those
[1:10:39] virtues to
[1:10:42] yeah that's right
[1:10:47] forgive me for being personal
[1:10:51] don't change my salary
[1:10:53] won't make me no more popular and my
[1:10:56] phone won't be ringing when I get home
[1:10:58] to go anywhere else and preach
[1:11:03] I told you I wanted two years ago
[1:11:05] I wanted to get this message out I cried
[1:11:08] and prayed God how
[1:11:09] wave come along like the old God
[1:11:12] these ministers knows I've taught with
[1:11:14] them told them go out and take this
[1:11:17] message to other people
[1:11:20] take the messages out to other people I
[1:11:24] thought oh God wait comes along they'll
[1:11:25] have him because he's got a little
[1:11:27] different delivery done well he's doing
[1:11:29] pretty good but he's getting unpopular
[1:11:31] too the more he preaches the more
[1:11:33] unpopular he'll get
[1:11:36] if he preaches a dream
[1:11:40] because the truth is not too well spoken
[1:11:44] but why
[1:11:48] why
[1:11:49] Would we not want the prophets asked it
[1:11:53] all right I don't understand that
[1:11:57] I cry and pray what's wrong
[1:12:02] what's wrong with people that don't want
[1:12:04] to hear what runaround have to say in
[1:12:06] the Purity oh that's God that's why we
[1:12:08] stay at home play today
[1:12:10] well now you just got a few scriptures
[1:12:13] and a lot of quotes and put around
[1:12:14] that's facing you so go right ahead
[1:12:17] the prophet said you can't wait till him
[1:12:18] don't worry I should get to play a thing
[1:12:20] please he never mentioned playing
[1:12:22] tonight
[1:12:24] he said there's a FireFold Ministry
[1:12:29] if you ain't got no powerful Ministry
[1:12:32] you know that I've explained it
[1:12:34] plug it takes do you get one
[1:12:38] but be searching for a five-fold
[1:12:40] Ministry amen
[1:12:43] some of you have left in crownless
[1:12:45] countries sitting here California
[1:12:49] used to wear it on my job
[1:12:51] I'm looking
[1:12:54] I do
[1:12:57] see
[1:12:59] he knows how to put us all together
[1:13:02] right that's right that's right but you
[1:13:04] see church I'm just trying to talk about
[1:13:06] Jesus Christ
[1:13:11] that's all
[1:13:15] it's Christ
[1:13:17] and him glorified all right now I'm
[1:13:20] going to quote right around and I'll
[1:13:21] give you the quote later he said
[1:13:23] adoption
[1:13:25] he's talking about Transfiguration now
[1:13:29] he said adopt you and glorifies Jesus
[1:13:37] do you see a man trying to glorify
[1:13:39] himself then you've got problems
[1:13:45] but you see a man trying to glorify
[1:13:47] Jesus Christ
[1:13:49] I just read you a quote where the
[1:13:51] Prophet said see what he does with the
[1:13:53] word
[1:13:54] that's right
[1:13:56] come and show me where I missed the word
[1:14:00] brother just left recently you know not
[1:14:02] too long ago and I just asked him one
[1:14:03] simple question I said brother just show
[1:14:06] me where I'm off to work
[1:14:11] I should just showed me
[1:14:16] well you go to them Fellowship meetings
[1:14:19] and then Fellowship meetings as
[1:14:20] Antichrist I said well I still don't ask
[1:14:22] you one simple question show me where
[1:14:24] I'm off the word
[1:14:29] well you just showed
[1:14:32] your scholarship meetings
[1:14:41] Hey Brother Fellowship from more people
[1:14:43] than I do
[1:14:45] so there's a lot of them that make fun
[1:14:46] of me about going to Fellowship meetings
[1:14:49] they stay on their telephones talking
[1:14:50] around the country to know more about
[1:14:52] what's going on in this message that I
[1:14:54] know of at all I don't know anything
[1:14:56] except I hear it from some of you
[1:14:58] because I'm not on internet me and my
[1:15:00] wife watched a video last night you know
[1:15:03] who it was
[1:15:05] Donnie Reagan
[1:15:09] you know what it's about
[1:15:15] you've done a good job
[1:15:18] I literally thought about calling him
[1:15:20] and asking could I played the tape in
[1:15:21] his church
[1:15:24] you've done a good job
[1:15:27] you know what you're talking about
[1:15:30] sex
[1:15:32] so everybody make fun of talking about
[1:15:34] sex but you tell me the man wouldn't
[1:15:36] ride
[1:15:39] not sure he could have explained certain
[1:15:41] things a little bit more into detail
[1:15:43] grind okay
[1:15:44] but he made a good point
[1:15:51] he said a man ought to marry
[1:15:54] a woman or to marry
[1:15:56] to keep from burning in their body
[1:16:01] he said that's God's ordained way
[1:16:05] for a husband and wife
[1:16:09] and he said it's God's way of keeping
[1:16:11] you from burning in your lust
[1:16:15] I agree with it
[1:16:19] Trump said
[1:16:21] when I hear the truth I don't mind amen
[1:16:23] it I don't care if the pope a wrong said
[1:16:25] it
[1:16:31] but we're going to be judged
[1:16:34] by the word
[1:16:38] you don't have to worry about whether
[1:16:40] what brother Dales told you is The Truth
[1:16:42] About Angels or what he's made or what
[1:16:44] he's saying
[1:16:45] you won't be judged by that
[1:16:49] that was my own personal thing all right
[1:16:52] you will be judged by the words you've
[1:16:55] heard
[1:16:57] and you'll either be justified by it or
[1:17:00] you'll be condemned by it and I know
[1:17:02] that
[1:17:06] and that makes you stand in reverence
[1:17:09] and respect
[1:17:11] to realize that God has been with us 40
[1:17:14] years
[1:17:16] to teach us the word right
[1:17:23] doctrines hasn't come in here and busted
[1:17:25] the church up
[1:17:35] who has believed our report
[1:17:40] and to whom is the arm of the Lord
[1:17:41] revealed amen
[1:17:44] yeah have you heard the word
[1:17:48] for 40 something years 40 years
[1:17:52] well thank God for the word
[1:17:58] you know a dumb donkey told truth one
[1:18:00] day
[1:18:01] thank God for the dumb donkey
[1:18:04] he told the truth
[1:18:06] he kept prophets being killed
[1:18:09] all right
[1:18:12] rooster preach the gospel amen
[1:18:16] all right
[1:18:21] he said these rocks will cry out
[1:18:28] you know what the old original seven
[1:18:30] inch reels especially
[1:18:32] you know what those seven each reel
[1:18:33] tapes was made out of us
[1:18:39] that's reading I don't like some of this
[1:18:40] other stuff it's too modern you know and
[1:18:42] it's fine it works perfectly good but
[1:18:45] the old seven inch reel was made out of
[1:18:47] rocks
[1:18:50] it's the dim rocks will cry out
[1:18:53] that was a stone
[1:18:55] made they were made from Stone
[1:19:00] put together where it would make a tape
[1:19:04] isn't that wonderful
[1:19:06] the rocks will cry out
[1:19:10] and they have that's right
[1:19:13] let's Stand Together
[1:19:15] just take on this
[1:19:18] compare it
[1:19:23] compared
[1:19:24] now let me give you one life quote that
[1:19:26] brother runs safe
[1:19:28] he said if God does anything
[1:19:32] for one person
[1:19:34] you may say any person but if if God
[1:19:38] does anything for anybody
[1:19:41] he said in order to throw the rest of
[1:19:42] the church into desperation
[1:19:45] whether it be healing or whether it be
[1:19:49] revealing of the word or what it means
[1:19:52] now listen folks
[1:19:56] we need rice
[1:19:59] it is drying up all over the country
[1:20:02] that's right
[1:20:03] not just here but other states I think
[1:20:06] it's drying up
[1:20:07] they don't know what's going on I was
[1:20:09] reading in the paper the other day where
[1:20:11] they said they couldn't this is
[1:20:12] happening and that's happening and they
[1:20:13] can't figure out why
[1:20:17] we need rain you know what we need then
[1:20:20] we need Sons and Daughters to call for
[1:20:24] rain all right
[1:20:29] we need to pray for rain
[1:20:32] pray for it and then say it
[1:20:37] and say God thank you for the rain
[1:20:40] can you say it that away let's say it
[1:20:43] all together God thank you for the rain
[1:20:46] amen amen we've made you known father
[1:20:51] now come and manifest yourself
[1:20:55] you remember years ago
[1:20:58] 1988 is that the year
[1:21:00] I stood right here
[1:21:02] July and August is our driest hottest
[1:21:05] months I stood right here and I said
[1:21:07] it'll rain more this August than it has
[1:21:11] ever rained
[1:21:13] that was a month or so before August
[1:21:16] they recorded in Gainesville there was
[1:21:18] more rain that month than they'd ever
[1:21:19] been in the month of August
[1:21:22] but you see I want you to say
[1:21:26] I know where I stand
[1:21:30] I stood on the word
[1:21:32] you think I'm afraid to preach right
[1:21:36] he's like I'm afraid to go out and face
[1:21:38] to the ministers and preachers and this
[1:21:40] whatever this message
[1:21:42] I fear no man
[1:21:44] why because if I'm wrong I can be made
[1:21:47] right
[1:21:48] but if I'm right
[1:21:53] I want you
[1:21:55] yes Lord to see it
[1:21:58] that's right amen and that brother saw
[1:22:02] the pillar of Fire Seed up here around
[1:22:03] the pulpit
[1:22:05] I told him I said don't tell nobody for
[1:22:06] a little while let it go
[1:22:10] don't one day I asked him I said well
[1:22:12] have you seen anything else you know he
[1:22:15] said yeah
[1:22:18] and I said well what'd you see
[1:22:21] he said I saw the pillar of fire leaving
[1:22:23] from here and going back that way
[1:22:25] immediately a brother jumped on that and
[1:22:27] he said we got to pray because the holy
[1:22:29] spirit's leaving out of here the filter
[1:22:31] fire is leaving
[1:22:32] I come right behind him I said no sir I
[1:22:35] said it's doing exactly what I ask him
[1:22:36] to do it's leaving here to go to you
[1:22:40] take it and speak it
[1:22:44] we need it children
