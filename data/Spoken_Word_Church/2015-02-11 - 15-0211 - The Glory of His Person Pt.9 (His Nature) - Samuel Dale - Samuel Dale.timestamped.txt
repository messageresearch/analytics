[11:21] uh seem like they've been here before
[11:23] that faith looks familiar but if they

[11:27] because that's uh we always say to you
[11:29] the first time you come he said welcome
[11:31] second time you come you're part of us
[11:33] so then we don't have anything to join

[11:37] with us tonight and good to see you
[11:40] sister johnny called me she got the
[11:41] message from terrance
[11:43] on the internet
[11:46] said for me to make sure and explain
[11:47] things
[11:49] you know she
[11:50] she had a previous appointment this
[11:52] morning that she didn't realize about it
[11:55] and she had to go
[11:56] with a nephew and things but you know
[11:58] she was supposed to call back and didn't
[12:00] get in touch with us but she said that
[12:03] they ran the test parts of what they
[12:05] were doing
[12:06] and you know getting ready they still
[12:08] got other things that's got to be done
[12:11] all right so they don't know yet
[12:14] what to do so she said she would explain
[12:16] all of it
[12:18] and then you know how doctors are they
[12:20] want you to go to this one i want you to
[12:21] go to that one once you go that one you
[12:23] know i remember one time was reading
[12:25] about
[12:26] you know they were say the reason they
[12:28] write in latin
[12:29] that the druggists you know and the
[12:31] doctor they got a good deal going and
[12:34] they write it in latin
[12:36] and what it says on there i got my money
[12:38] you get yours
[12:40] it doesn't say on there what kind of
[12:42] medicine to do it just says that part
[12:45] but that's pretty well the way they do
[12:47] but i'm sure she'll explain it to us
[12:49] maybe sunday you know in all of the
[12:52] things so remember that remember wade
[12:54] will be taking up the lord willing again
[12:56] on sunday to continue his series on the
[12:59] statue of a perfect man
[13:02] and let's see
[13:03] uh something else oh yeah we've got the
[13:06] the valentine bandwidth coming up this
[13:08] saturday
[13:09] make sure and be there on time for the
[13:11] couples and things that have signed up
[13:13] and and all and we're looking forward to
[13:16] a good time we always do we'd have a
[13:19] good fellowship together
[13:21] in the lord any other announcements that
[13:24] we
[13:25] are missing
[13:27] we generally i mentioned
[13:29] sister gabriel a while ago
[13:31] yeah remember sister gabriel she's been
[13:33] having problems this week with what was
[13:36] it diarrhea yeah yeah all right so
[13:38] remember that just keep her keeper in
[13:40] your prayers and i guess taran said
[13:42] remember my sister they've given her
[13:45] maybe 24-48 hours to live so remember
[13:48] that and you know just keep the family
[13:51] in your prayers all right
[13:54] if you'd like turn in your scriptures
[13:56] turn to revelations 1 and
[13:59] genesis 1.
[14:01] we're going to try to pick up the
[14:02] thought from sunday
[14:04] and continue on a little bit and what
[14:06] we're talking about so let's just pray
[14:10] heavenly father we thank you for an
[14:12] opportunity
[14:14] to be able to come together tonight lord
[14:16] in your grace and your love and
[14:18] to be able to just
[14:20] fellowship a little bit around you and
[14:22] talk about you
[14:23] and the bible says that the children
[14:26] they speak often one to another
[14:28] and the book of remembrance was written
[14:31] so we believe lord that in this last
[14:33] days that a book of remembrance is being
[14:35] written about the little bride because
[14:37] she's becoming your word and we thank
[14:39] you we just ask you to have your way
[14:41] with each and every one of us forgive
[14:43] our sins
[14:44] remember the sickness among us lord
[14:47] talking to brother gary there today
[14:48] about his foot we pray that you would
[14:51] just reach down and touch that
[14:53] and make all things well because we
[14:56] believe you and father we we commit
[14:58] everything into your hands now just have
[15:00] your way in the service you said you
[15:03] sent your word and healed us
[15:05] and so lord as the word goes forth may
[15:07] we receive it
[15:09] just have your way with us in jesus name
[15:12] amen
[15:14] all right revelations
[15:17] 1
[15:20] beginning with verse 10 and i was in the
[15:22] spirit on the lord's day and heard
[15:24] behind me a great voice says of a
[15:25] trumpet saying i'm alpha and omega the
[15:28] first and the last and what thou see us
[15:30] write in the book
[15:31] and send it unto the seven churches
[15:33] which are in
[15:34] asia unto ephesus and unto smyrna and
[15:38] unto pergamos and under tartara and a
[15:41] disartist and into philadelphia and who
[15:43] and unto lady osea where we are right
[15:47] and i turned to see the voice that spake
[15:48] with me and being turned i saw seven
[15:50] golden candlesticks
[15:52] and in the midst of the seven
[15:54] candlesticks one like unto the son of
[15:56] man
[15:56] clothe with a garment down to the foot
[15:59] and gird about to pouch with a golden
[16:01] girdle amen so remember that let's go to
[16:05] genesis
[16:07] 1
[16:09] and we'll read 26-27
[16:12] god said
[16:14] let us make man in our image
[16:16] after our likeness
[16:18] let them have dominion over the fish of
[16:20] the sea
[16:21] and over the fowl of the iron over the
[16:23] cattle and over all the earth
[16:25] and every creeping thing that creepeth
[16:27] upon the earth
[16:28] so god created man in his own image
[16:31] in the image of god
[16:34] created he him male and female created
[16:38] he
[16:39] them and you may be seated the lord had
[16:41] his best blessing
[16:43] to the reading of the word
[16:46] now i ran off the notes that i was using
[16:49] sunday not all of them just
[16:51] some of the basic quotes that i wanted
[16:53] to
[16:54] you to keep and remember
[16:56] and you know
[16:58] so i hope you will keep these and you
[17:00] can refer back to them
[17:02] you know later on sometime in your life
[17:04] and you need them or something because
[17:06] we we appreciate it because we thank god
[17:09] he sent us a prophet
[17:10] and gave us his word
[17:13] to be able to overcome
[17:15] if any age ever needed anything about
[17:18] overcoming it certainly this age
[17:20] because everything has gone wrong can go
[17:23] wrong
[17:24] and nobody can seem to do anything right
[17:28] they figure it out this way and about
[17:30] the time they get it figured out it
[17:31] falls through so
[17:33] that's the way i guess it's supposed to
[17:35] be
[17:36] but now
[17:38] we've been talking about
[17:41] how that
[17:43] and go ahead and pull up the drawing
[17:45] brother joe and we'll we'll start a
[17:47] little bit from there
[17:49] we've been talking about one true and
[17:52] living god
[17:54] we read here in genesis it says let us
[17:57] make man
[17:59] in our own image
[18:01] all right we trinitarians
[18:04] you know we used to we loved that
[18:06] because it sounded like there was two or
[18:08] three people
[18:10] but we know in reality that that's not
[18:13] true
[18:14] but then
[18:15] we you know we we try to figure out
[18:17] everything and we we believe and i just
[18:20] made a little simple uh sketch of a
[18:23] drawing because we've been talking about
[18:26] the attributes of god
[18:29] all right
[18:30] the attributes of god
[18:34] what
[18:35] makes up his as we'll get to it in a
[18:38] minute and you see that i put it all the
[18:39] way down
[18:41] and uh it brings it to the
[18:44] bring it down to the point now we've
[18:45] left another one tonight to where that
[18:48] he can go
[18:49] if he'll roll it on up
[18:51] and you'll see
[18:52] that all of this that we were talking
[18:54] about
[18:56] equals out to be
[18:58] the very nature
[19:01] of god now we'll get to that later in
[19:03] the message
[19:04] on understanding
[19:07] all right but it all equals out to be
[19:09] that
[19:11] now attributes you are the attributes of
[19:14] your or the attribute of your father
[19:17] you know that's a simple point
[19:19] and uh we believe then the attributes of
[19:22] god that he had those attributes before
[19:24] the world
[19:25] he didn't gain attributes coming into
[19:27] the world
[19:29] he gained the ability to
[19:31] display those attributes
[19:34] all right there's only three attributes
[19:36] of god which is father son and holy
[19:38] ghost that's the three attributes
[19:40] so then all you're looking at is
[19:42] involved in one of those three
[19:44] attributes of father son and holy ghost
[19:48] and seeing it then we can look at it and
[19:51] see how that it equals the word
[19:54] coming down and we've been back before
[19:56] the foundation of the world
[19:58] dealing with on this side of what we've
[20:01] labeled as eternity
[20:03] and tonight we're going to try to move
[20:05] over a little bit
[20:08] but i want to make sure that we
[20:09] understand
[20:11] you know and follow the line even if we
[20:13] have to keep continuing the message
[20:16] because it doesn't bother me
[20:17] to try to minister
[20:19] unto you these things
[20:21] uh i really abby
[20:24] i was viewing the uh
[20:26] the sunday afternoon services
[20:29] there the other day and
[20:30] abby she came in there and was sitting
[20:32] there with me and you remember i got a
[20:35] little feist reading
[20:38] and you know i was really going as fast
[20:40] as i could to try to get all the quotes
[20:42] in without it being so much time and
[20:44] still took
[20:45] two hours i guess on that service or
[20:47] something to the order
[20:49] but
[20:50] you know i was really just rolling the
[20:52] cross and abby and me she said
[20:55] probably you sure was reading mighty
[20:57] fast
[20:58] you know so that so
[21:01] you know i was just trying to get it in
[21:03] but i was just going so fast but i've
[21:05] got the quotes here i want to give back
[21:07] to you
[21:08] but now
[21:10] god before the foundation of the world
[21:13] according to christ the mystery of god
[21:14] revealed he had a plan and a purpose
[21:19] in doing these things and that was to
[21:21] let himself
[21:22] to be revealed
[21:24] or made known
[21:26] you know
[21:27] and those attributes that he had as
[21:30] savior healer
[21:33] um
[21:33] christ logos theophany those great big
[21:36] words that we use and probably don't
[21:39] understand not even how to spell most of
[21:42] it let alone what they are but you know
[21:45] we do read and study on what he says the
[21:48] prophet of using those things because i
[21:51] believe he understood don't you
[21:53] you know with a seventh grade education
[21:55] he knew what those words he would have
[21:57] to look them up sometime
[21:59] but yet
[22:00] he understood all right but then seeing
[22:03] that there's just one true and living
[22:05] god
[22:07] there can't be a trinity
[22:09] because there's no such thing in the
[22:10] scriptures
[22:12] and if there is three gods
[22:15] who created who
[22:17] who was the first
[22:19] you know
[22:21] i mean who started what a father
[22:23] within the did the father create the son
[22:24] that the son created the logos you know
[22:26] the theophany the holy ghost or whatever
[22:30] or what are we doing the first
[22:32] commandment says that
[22:34] the lord is one amen all right and see
[22:37] then we got caught up in all of that by
[22:39] mankind teaching us
[22:42] his philosophy that had no background in
[22:45] the bible
[22:47] and for
[22:48] thousands of years mankind has been in
[22:50] the darkness they called it the dark
[22:53] ages of
[22:54] christianity down about a thousand well
[22:57] somewhere a little less up to 1500 they
[23:00] call that the dark ages i differ with
[23:02] that i know it is in the basis of what
[23:05] was going on back there but i believe
[23:07] this is the darkest age
[23:10] i believe now is the darkest age of all
[23:13] things
[23:14] because even though in all the light
[23:17] that there is
[23:18] you know this light cannot put out that
[23:21] total darkness
[23:24] you say yes it has let's put it no it
[23:26] can't put it out
[23:28] darkness is still is here in a ma in a
[23:32] major way
[23:33] around the world today especially in
[23:36] what we call the religious realm
[23:39] of mankind all right and see man still
[23:42] believing those things but we believe in
[23:44] the one true and living god
[23:47] not the god in three persons
[23:51] point
[23:52] because a person's a personality
[23:54] personality is an individual individual
[23:56] is a person so you're saying the same
[23:58] thing as the people who believe in three
[24:00] literal gods and so you don't know it so
[24:03] it's time to wake up and begin to
[24:06] follow the the word and get into the
[24:08] word of understanding
[24:10] all right
[24:11] and in doing that then we we don't want
[24:14] to believe the the trinity concept of
[24:16] god in three persons or any way like
[24:19] that but we don't want to go with the
[24:22] oneness concept because
[24:24] that goes off the scale just as well on
[24:26] the opposite end because the oneness
[24:29] doctrine is what you would call jesus
[24:32] only
[24:34] which would be you know that jesus was
[24:36] the last form of god
[24:40] and you know then that would would why
[24:42] they take care to that like one like
[24:44] your finger you know or the way they
[24:46] would describe it
[24:49] but remember
[24:51] the bride is the life's form of god in
[24:53] the gentile dispensation
[24:55] so then that would leave the oneness out
[24:58] of it
[24:59] but it wouldn't make sure that we didn't
[25:01] go into the trinity
[25:04] all right
[25:05] because see we can't go that away and
[25:07] believe it
[25:09] and now the point we want to get to in a
[25:11] little bit is to make sure
[25:13] that it as we read there in genesis that
[25:16] it says let us make man well that's not
[25:20] two people that's right
[25:23] we went through that we've brought it
[25:25] through and trying to show the things
[25:26] from the prophet that you know
[25:29] uh
[25:30] that how everything went
[25:32] and
[25:33] it's not to go that away it's to go with
[25:36] the real true understanding of one god
[25:39] and to see
[25:41] that he says let us make man
[25:44] that that's word in spirit
[25:48] and that's we can say that that's father
[25:50] and son if we understand
[25:52] because remember how we brought it out
[25:54] trying to illustrate it that you can
[25:57] take the quotes
[25:59] and just quote yourself to death which
[26:01] you can quote all god was he poured into
[26:03] christ
[26:06] and then all christ poured into the
[26:07] church
[26:09] and with our terminology of the human
[26:11] mind of all see then you're leaving a
[26:14] gap over here a vacuum a place that's
[26:17] empty and then you're leaving this place
[26:20] empty
[26:21] of all and you just wind up with the the
[26:23] chi the church
[26:25] well that's not to my understanding i
[26:28] don't want to do that now
[26:30] i believe that all god is going to
[26:33] reveal to you and i
[26:35] that's what i was getting out sunday all
[26:38] he's going to reveal to you and i
[26:41] is the all of it
[26:44] all right
[26:45] but then when we leave this world
[26:50] see it'll just be enough to get us there
[26:54] because there's going to be a message to
[26:56] cheer down through the endless ages the
[26:57] prophet said all right then uh it'll be
[27:00] an eternal partaking of the word of god
[27:02] you mean to think that you and i with
[27:04] our peanut brain and what little bit we
[27:06] know and i say a little bit
[27:09] and i mean that what is the word spanish
[27:11] petite you know or
[27:13] ptsd ever you know a little bit in other
[27:15] words put your fingers together and rub
[27:16] them real tight and then look between
[27:18] there and ain't nothing well that's
[27:19] about the human mind
[27:21] that's about the basis that we think we
[27:23] are in great revelation
[27:26] all right
[27:27] and see if there is a god that's for you
[27:30] to think about
[27:33] then you mean to tell me that that god
[27:36] would would just
[27:39] do what we're doing here now and not
[27:41] leave the place to where that we would
[27:43] have a wonderful opportunity in eternity
[27:47] to ever partake of his glorious
[27:49] revelation of himself amen
[27:52] right you know
[27:55] see that's that's what i'm trying to get
[27:57] you to see
[27:59] all right
[28:02] that we
[28:03] must
[28:07] use the words of the prophet
[28:09] to express what we're saying
[28:12] true
[28:14] but sometimes you have to
[28:17] make your own thought about it
[28:20] and that's what gets me sick is people
[28:22] will say just say what the prophet said
[28:27] well one brother was saying that one day
[28:28] and i just handed him a book i said
[28:30] would you mind reading that statement
[28:35] and he looked at it and he said i ain't
[28:37] going to read it
[28:39] it was what the prophet said you know
[28:41] what he said
[28:42] said luther dominated and died and went
[28:44] to hell
[28:47] well see he wasn't going to read that
[28:48] because he knew i was going to say back
[28:50] to him you know okay say what he says
[28:55] i said brother you know he's talking
[28:56] about the lutheran denomination not
[28:58] luther because there's no way luke
[29:00] luther could have brought the just shall
[29:01] live by faith and then died and went to
[29:03] hell even all the lutherans didn't die
[29:05] and go to hell or ain't you know
[29:09] but see then brother
[29:10] luis made a statement the other day that
[29:13] i've always
[29:14] thought about
[29:16] and he he was telling about how that you
[29:18] interpret
[29:20] and see really to interpret and may i
[29:22] quote him and verbatim i mean not
[29:24] verbatim but close
[29:26] that
[29:27] you quote by thought
[29:31] you don't quote literal words
[29:35] we say
[29:36] let's go to town
[29:38] what is spanish turns it around and says
[29:40] to town we go
[29:44] all right see it's it's impossible now
[29:46] if i miss that you just don't worry
[29:48] about it just you correct it my point is
[29:50] one thing
[29:54] that
[29:56] god has to reveal
[29:59] to us
[30:01] what the bible says
[30:04] what the prophet has said amen
[30:07] or we don't get it
[30:09] i don't care how much you quote right i
[30:12] mean that's wonderful that's good
[30:16] it's a whole lot better to be that away
[30:17] than to not be able to quote at all
[30:20] you know
[30:21] but just don't get to the bases until we
[30:23] can quote so much until that we lose the
[30:26] whole thought or concept
[30:29] that said the prophet one day said let's
[30:31] stand and address the third person of
[30:33] the trinity
[30:35] he believed in a trinity see there all
[30:37] along he believed in a trend that's the
[30:39] way people interpret he believed in a
[30:41] trinity all along he believed that and
[30:43] these other four thousand times that he
[30:45] said and believe in one god
[30:47] he was really trying to deceive the rest
[30:49] of the world
[30:50] well he done a good job
[30:52] he done a good job deceiving me because
[30:55] you know
[30:57] i believe in one true and living god
[30:58] what do you believe
[31:01] and that jesus was that god we'll get to
[31:04] it later
[31:05] made manifest in human flesh
[31:10] called a son
[31:12] wow
[31:13] but yet we we use the terminology
[31:17] and say we don't believe in eternal
[31:18] sonship and we don't
[31:22] because there's no such thing as being
[31:23] an eternal sonship
[31:26] but there was an eternal godhead amen
[31:29] right
[31:30] we gave it to you there sunday eternal
[31:32] godhead eternal godhead is what father
[31:34] son and holy ghost makes up the godhead
[31:38] so then you've got to have all of you
[31:40] got to bring all of these forms together
[31:43] to
[31:44] understand
[31:46] but it was like i tried to explain
[31:48] sunday
[31:49] any one of those attributes
[31:53] can be called the fullness
[31:55] right
[31:59] right
[32:02] the father was the fullness of the
[32:04] godhead right
[32:06] in jesus christ upon earth two thousand
[32:09] years ago dwelt the fullness of the
[32:11] godhead bodily amen
[32:13] and the christ is the holy ghost
[32:16] which is the fullness of the godhead
[32:18] dwelling in you and i
[32:20] by the new birth
[32:23] now brother dale i only got it i only
[32:25] just got a spirit i
[32:27] i hope i get to a point
[32:29] i've told you many years ago i tried my
[32:32] best to say something and
[32:34] i seen it go
[32:36] out like that over your head and
[32:39] over mine and i said forget it
[32:43] but i won't forget it now
[32:46] because i believe the lord has given me
[32:48] a way to express a few things and so
[32:50] just bear with me
[32:52] and pray for me because you know
[32:55] uh
[32:58] what do you think about the person of
[33:00] jesus christ being in you
[33:02] by the baptism of the holy ghost
[33:08] but how do you believe that
[33:14] how can you explain that
[33:18] how can you explain that it would be
[33:20] possible forever 7 billion people or
[33:23] more in the world today that everybody
[33:26] in the world could have
[33:28] the baptism of the holy ghost if they'd
[33:30] receive it right
[33:33] now we know they won't but that's not
[33:34] that's not you're not getting my point
[33:37] i'm making it a capability
[33:40] all right
[33:43] how can you explain that
[33:45] how could god be divided into 7
[33:48] billion
[33:51] persons of the baptism of the holy ghost
[33:56] living in you
[33:58] that's impossible to explain you might
[34:01] as well forget it
[34:05] but believe it
[34:06] amen
[34:08] right
[34:09] we believe it can be done because he can
[34:11] do it
[34:13] right
[34:14] all right
[34:15] but are you getting all the attributes
[34:17] of god
[34:18] that we had on this side over here
[34:21] of our line of we called eternity we're
[34:23] going to start tonight bringing it over
[34:26] a little bit
[34:27] over on to the other side
[34:29] and begin to try to understand
[34:33] the truth
[34:35] of one true and living god
[34:39] i gave you out some quotes and
[34:42] i will read down real fast because i
[34:44] gave them to you for you to be able to
[34:46] read you don't have to follow me but
[34:48] they are basically underlined to where
[34:51] you can follow we won't put them on the
[34:53] screen because this is what i was giving
[34:55] you sunday and i wanted you to keep
[34:57] these
[34:59] because remember we were talking about
[35:02] that god didn't send a son
[35:05] amen
[35:06] he came himself
[35:12] now that does away with trinitarianism
[35:16] amen
[35:17] right amen
[35:20] because you can't believe in eternal
[35:21] sonship
[35:26] so then
[35:27] the son had to be the father in another
[35:29] form
[35:31] called the son
[35:36] so he came himself
[35:39] amen
[35:42] all right think about it
[35:45] the god who's reaching mercy
[35:47] that was an eternal atonement because
[35:50] god came himself
[35:53] god came himself in the form of sinful
[35:56] flesh to make an eternal atonement an
[35:58] eternal atonement
[36:01] revelation of jesus christ what'd he say
[36:03] take an old testament type name the
[36:05] garden when the first news came to glory
[36:08] that the son adam
[36:10] had been lost did god send an angel
[36:14] did he send a son
[36:16] did he send another one like unto us
[36:20] no
[36:21] he came himself
[36:23] to redeem the lost son
[36:26] hallelujah god did not entrust his plan
[36:29] of salvation to another he trusted only
[36:32] himself
[36:35] well my brother
[36:37] you just tie me up because the father
[36:40] could trust a son
[36:46] he could if he was the son
[36:54] no you said well well you you walk on
[36:57] thin ice i love thin ice
[37:00] because you're going to walk soft on
[37:01] thin ice
[37:02] you know you know if it's thick you go
[37:04] boom
[37:05] but if you want thin house you're gonna
[37:10] yeah
[37:11] right
[37:13] and that to me is the way
[37:15] the word is
[37:17] all right
[37:19] think about it
[37:22] that day on calvary god had required it
[37:24] no man was worthy
[37:26] no man was able
[37:28] no man could do it and god came himself
[37:32] and was made human and lived in a human
[37:34] under human desires
[37:36] he says he even died as a
[37:38] god in human flesh was dying
[37:42] conferences he said
[37:43] that god had with man
[37:46] he came himself he didn't trust it to
[37:48] somebody someone else when god came down
[37:51] to redeem man he never trusted to a
[37:54] prophet he came himself for he was the
[37:57] only one that could do it
[38:00] right
[38:03] god's provided way
[38:05] he never sent some servant
[38:08] he came himself
[38:10] up and down in the garden of screaming
[38:11] adam adam where art thou
[38:16] god's provided way of approach to
[38:17] fellowship god never sent an angel
[38:21] he came himself
[38:25] he came himself
[38:29] to perfection
[38:32] he was nothing less than almighty god
[38:35] hid in human flesh he came himself to
[38:37] offer his own blood
[38:40] well now like i said sunday night so you
[38:43] lock in on
[38:44] well that was when he came down in flash
[38:48] you know
[38:50] well the one right back up above there
[38:52] he's talking about running around in the
[38:53] garden hunting his son
[38:56] because remember
[38:58] back there is where he first came into
[39:01] being right
[39:04] you mind this
[39:06] let's see if i can find this
[39:09] i love to keep looking
[39:11] in a message called the pillar of fire
[39:14] 1953
[39:16] now the bible teaches us that the logos
[39:19] went out of god or i might say all the
[39:23] god becoming his first body
[39:28] the logos went out of god
[39:34] they come in his first body form
[39:37] what about it
[39:42] see if you get into the message it'll
[39:44] just keep on opening up
[39:46] what are you following me
[39:48] god came himself
[39:50] he says on having the conferences that
[39:52] he came himself it was a
[39:54] man-sized job a god-sized job
[40:00] and he says on questions and answers on
[40:02] genesis in other words adam the first
[40:04] man in the lord creation the first
[40:05] creation was god himself
[40:11] i don't understand that
[40:13] you can't understand that you better ask
[40:16] for a revelation
[40:18] because you've got to realize then that
[40:20] all of this has got to be the one god
[40:22] coming down to be revealed
[40:25] all right
[40:26] then what does he say on
[40:29] and thy seed shall possess the gate to
[40:31] the enemy
[40:32] talk about in the garden and now jesus
[40:34] who was he he come hunting this first
[40:37] lost son did god sent an angel he came
[40:40] himself
[40:42] he came himself
[40:44] now i like this one so we'll use that
[40:46] part on the message jehovah jireh
[40:48] preached in 61
[40:50] and another thing did you notice god's
[40:52] never sent an angel down to hunt up his
[40:54] lost child he came himself that's the
[40:58] reason jesus reasoned that jesus was
[41:00] made
[41:03] why where he could pay the price right
[41:07] right or he could pay the price
[41:09] all right
[41:11] then we got into a little thought our
[41:13] sunday
[41:15] that i don't want you to lose
[41:19] and we started using the quote from the
[41:21] prophet where he said a part of god went
[41:24] out
[41:26] and that just blows the human mind
[41:28] doesn't it
[41:30] because there's no way to comprehend a
[41:32] part of god going out
[41:35] because you're trying to lose empty
[41:36] leave empty spaces and trying to move
[41:38] things around and it won't work
[41:40] but it's like i tried to explain it
[41:44] you know the bible says eternal godhead
[41:46] can be understood by the things we see
[41:48] all right as a human being i can be in
[41:51] my home in one room with my wife and i'm
[41:53] a husband
[41:56] i can move over into the next room
[41:59] and there's one of the kids you know the
[42:02] children
[42:03] and i'm a father
[42:06] and then i can move over into the next
[42:08] room and there's one of the grandkids
[42:11] and i'm a grandfather
[42:13] i can move into the next room and
[42:14] there's one of the great grandkids
[42:18] right
[42:20] now to each one of them i'm the fullness
[42:24] to them
[42:26] because my wife can't have another
[42:27] husband or another something she's got
[42:30] to relate to the point of me
[42:33] my kids can't have another as wondering
[42:36] about the father the grandkids can't
[42:38] wonder about the granddad you getting it
[42:41] so each one can be a fullness of doing
[42:45] but then as far as what is to
[42:47] relationship to me that's only a part
[42:51] because in the next room it's a part
[42:54] in the next room is a park
[42:57] well i can't be god that can remain here
[43:00] as this form
[43:02] and let another form go out to be
[43:05] part
[43:06] and then let another part come out to be
[43:08] another part of god i can't do that
[43:10] because i'm limited to that being but
[43:12] there's one thing for sure
[43:16] as i start from father i mean from
[43:18] husband
[43:21] huh
[43:22] you know that everything that away
[43:24] is increasing
[43:26] my ability
[43:29] or expanding me
[43:32] right
[43:33] right
[43:34] my children come into being that's
[43:36] expanding me
[43:39] the grandkids come into being that's
[43:40] expanding me the dna can prove it
[43:44] the grandkids and if it went on the
[43:46] great and the great and the great and
[43:47] the great grace each one of those would
[43:49] be an expanding of the one person back
[43:52] there
[43:54] right
[43:55] well see god has the ability to be able
[43:57] to be
[43:58] in all of those places
[44:02] at the same time
[44:03] amen
[44:06] but what are you going to explain it
[44:08] with
[44:09] because if you move it all over here
[44:12] you've left a hole
[44:16] and you move all of that over here
[44:17] that's me moving you know
[44:20] but god is not that away
[44:23] all that goes out of god
[44:26] from the beginning
[44:27] that away no matter how far it would
[44:30] expand itself through savior healer
[44:33] uh logos speech word
[44:36] it's an expansion
[44:38] it expands him
[44:40] it makes him greater
[44:43] it doesn't diminish or leave something
[44:46] off
[44:49] because seeing god apart can be the
[44:51] fullness
[44:54] but we human mortals can't be that away
[44:57] right amen
[45:01] but we ought to be able to understand it
[45:06] all right look what he says on the
[45:07] unveiling of god
[45:09] he's talking about his arm went off
[45:11] that's the word key word for uh vomit up
[45:15] see it would mean like his arm went off
[45:18] or his eye went out another person
[45:20] all right
[45:22] that is he changed himself
[45:24] he poured himself into
[45:26] amen into another mask
[45:29] into another form
[45:31] not another person went out of hymn
[45:34] called the holy spirit but it was he
[45:37] himself
[45:41] just because he created the world
[45:48] you see we in our peanut brain
[45:52] want to make a story
[45:55] and stories don't work in bible
[45:57] terminologies
[46:00] you know what i mean
[46:02] you could tell a story to help but you
[46:04] can't write a story
[46:09] but look what he goes on to say
[46:13] he himself poured himself into the
[46:15] people
[46:17] christ in you
[46:20] all right
[46:23] then we got on down into what the
[46:25] message was hebrews chapter 1.
[46:28] and he's talking about
[46:32] that that great that was jehovah
[46:34] that was jehovah god and now as the
[46:37] theologians call it a theophany went
[46:39] from that
[46:42] which was called in the scriptural
[46:44] the logos
[46:46] the logos that went out of god it's hard
[46:48] to explain
[46:50] but it was a part of god
[46:54] right
[46:55] now
[46:56] see you've got to argue with him you're
[46:57] not going to argue with me
[46:59] i don't have enough sense to argue with
[47:01] you about it you don't have enough sense
[47:02] to argue with me
[47:08] see we've got to accept what's said and
[47:10] pray for revelation amen
[47:15] now
[47:16] he's not talking about an arm going out
[47:22] see that's what we say park there goes
[47:24] an arm okay that's the sun okay over
[47:27] here is the sun that's an armpit there
[47:29] goes another arm and that's logos ovian
[47:31] floating around that's holy ghost
[47:32] floating around and look over to god and
[47:34] he's missing all these parts
[47:37] that ain't even common sense
[47:40] if you'll get what i said a moment ago
[47:42] it will really help you the more this
[47:44] thing expands brother let's see what a
[47:46] brother more called it
[47:50] was it the expanding of god
[47:52] expanding of god
[47:54] that was 1971
[47:57] probably
[47:59] and i really enjoyed it
[48:01] god expanded himself
[48:05] every day he expands more of himself
[48:10] it doesn't move anything from here over
[48:12] to here
[48:18] it's expanding it just like
[48:21] husband
[48:23] father
[48:25] grandfather
[48:27] great grandfather
[48:30] that's not doing away with
[48:33] that's an expanding
[48:35] that's going out further opening up more
[48:38] right amen
[48:44] he says the great that was jehovah
[48:46] he calls him the theophany called him
[48:48] the logos
[48:50] that went out of guard it's hard to
[48:51] explain
[48:54] but it was part of god
[48:57] right
[48:59] well i'll tell you what boy you all
[49:01] y'all really are messed up well i'd like
[49:04] to hear you explain it
[49:06] i've heard the three trinity concepts
[49:08] haven't you
[49:11] i've heard the oneness concepts and
[49:12] thoughts
[49:14] and they're not able to put it together
[49:17] yeah but but you're dividing up parts
[49:20] and that's what we think
[49:22] we think the holy ghost is and that was
[49:24] one of the explanations for the monkey
[49:27] is like a pie and you you cut it up and
[49:30] you give out the pieces and when you do
[49:32] you wind up with no pie
[49:35] now
[49:36] that's about as carnal as you can get
[49:39] because even him could stand there one
[49:41] day and take a fish and hound out a fish
[49:44] and hand out a fish and hand out a fish
[49:47] hand out a fish
[49:49] every time he looked back put his hand
[49:50] there was another fish
[49:54] but you see that's what we think
[49:57] and we think we've got it all figured
[49:59] out or as we get to as i always say to
[50:02] you
[50:03] do we need to understand these things
[50:09] well
[50:09] we need the simple form of salvation
[50:19] we need to get the people saved
[50:24] you know it's kind of odd how brother
[50:26] branham could preach some of the deepest
[50:27] messages he's ever preached and the
[50:29] people would weep themselves to the
[50:31] altar
[50:32] children and all
[50:38] he said but we need salvation
[50:43] i'm trying my best to preach salvation
[50:46] because if you don't understand one god
[50:50] how are you going to get saved
[50:55] may i ask you a question
[51:00] six months down the road preaching i
[51:02] guess
[51:03] let me ask you a simple question
[51:07] as i said a while ago how can you have
[51:09] the person i liked the other day because
[51:11] i i watched the videos and see i go this
[51:14] way
[51:17] and odd part i'm right-handed
[51:19] you notice wade left-handed he goes this
[51:22] way
[51:25] we're going to get this figured out one
[51:26] of these days which way to go
[51:30] but think about it
[51:34] a simple question
[51:42] how many people are the inside of you
[51:43] right now
[51:55] would it be odd for the prophet to say
[51:59] brother is it hard to believe
[52:01] that there's another person inside of
[52:03] you
[52:08] right
[52:12] see what is the soul of man
[52:18] what is the soul of man
[52:27] look what he said on who is this
[52:30] 1950.
[52:32] and that was the logos that went out of
[52:34] god in the beginning that was the son of
[52:35] god that came out of the bosom of the
[52:38] father
[52:40] that was what was in the beginning was
[52:42] the word and the word was with god and
[52:45] the word was god and the word was made
[52:47] flesh and dwelt among us in the
[52:48] beginning was god then out of god came
[52:51] the logos a part of god
[52:54] that went out of god
[53:00] be number 13 on your
[53:02] pages
[53:04] a part of god
[53:08] that went out of god
[53:11] now
[53:13] i thought we were supposed to be
[53:15] dependent
[53:17] upon the prophet's
[53:20] wording and the definitions and the
[53:22] interpretations and et cetera
[53:25] is that
[53:26] true we we none of us have any right to
[53:30] self-interpret
[53:32] the word of god
[53:34] i don't care who you are
[53:36] i don't give a hoot how long you hunted
[53:38] and fish with the prophet
[53:39] because i'll even put it this way the
[53:41] prophet had a right never had a right of
[53:43] self-interpretation
[53:48] come on get it right he didn't have a
[53:50] right of self-interpretation because he
[53:51] brought the wrong interpretation
[53:55] you want an example of it because i know
[53:57] you don't like for me to use them but
[53:58] you know that before the fields broke he
[54:01] believed the white horse rider was the
[54:02] holy ghost you know what that was that
[54:05] was brother branham self-interpretation
[54:08] right
[54:14] you see how easy it can be
[54:17] i got it somewhere in the notes were
[54:19] brought around and said as a little kid
[54:21] i used to think that
[54:23] jesus loved me and god hated me you
[54:25] remember that one
[54:27] man
[54:29] a prophet
[54:31] he said until i found out there's a
[54:33] self-same person
[54:36] but see look what i'm getting at
[54:41] the message the curtain of time 56
[54:44] god which was a part of god
[54:47] and god seen what the end would be from
[54:49] the beginning
[54:50] and the logos come to the earth which
[54:52] was christ the word
[54:54] spoken word of god part of god
[54:57] and was made flesh and dwelt among us
[55:06] look what he says on the message at thy
[55:08] word
[55:11] i believe that even the holy spirit and
[55:13] angels and all these are just attributes
[55:16] of god it's just a part of god
[55:19] it's his makeup
[55:21] it's part of that
[55:23] went off
[55:25] his spirit and so forth
[55:27] that he created to be his helpers
[55:33] apart
[55:35] questions and answers on genesis
[55:39] talks about that little eye supernatural
[55:41] that we can see logos or anointing
[55:45] as i was going to say the part of ghent
[55:47] god began to develop into something so
[55:49] that human beings could have some type
[55:52] of idea what it was
[55:57] may i make my statement
[56:01] had god not cain
[56:03] came come little english words you know
[56:06] had god not come the way
[56:09] that he did
[56:11] do you think we could have ever
[56:12] understood any other way
[56:15] do you think there's any other way that
[56:17] it could have been done
[56:19] well now now brother branham should have
[56:21] said this he should have said that well
[56:24] you know what
[56:25] i'm not following
[56:27] you man
[56:31] because
[56:32] the way he said it was the perfect way
[56:35] or else
[56:37] what he said that god couldn't have
[56:39] another plan
[56:42] said he had only one plan he had only
[56:44] one thing one doing
[56:46] he couldn't do it
[56:47] he said well it should have been done
[56:49] this way well you know what we needed
[56:51] you before we needed god
[56:54] sorry to be sarcastic
[56:58] is that true
[57:00] if you and i can straighten out a profit
[57:02] or straighten out god we evidently must
[57:05] be greater than god
[57:08] well brother dale we know we don't do
[57:10] that
[57:11] well why do we play with the words
[57:18] would you explain you come up here and
[57:20] explain the things that i've said
[57:24] sunday
[57:25] in that god didn't trust it with nobody
[57:27] else he came himself
[57:30] he didn't send a son he didn't send an
[57:32] angel he didn't send another one like us
[57:35] he came himself
[57:38] all right
[57:39] then take it that
[57:42] it was a part of him that went out
[57:46] to create
[57:53] that it's a part of him that lives in
[57:55] you by the baptism of the holy ghost
[57:58] go home take your computer
[58:01] type in part of god
[58:04] you'll find some pretty good quotes in
[58:06] there that i didn't cover because i
[58:08] don't have time to
[58:10] but are you listening
[58:16] not another person
[58:19] not another
[58:20] person god came himself
[58:31] you know brother random said he sent
[58:32] back his soul in the form of the baptism
[58:34] of the holy ghost and he said when
[58:36] that's passed out in other words
[58:38] paraphrasing the word
[58:40] when it's divided out
[58:41] it'll be finished
[58:45] his soul
[58:48] what is a soul
[58:51] oh it's just the nature of the spirit
[58:56] there's no such word
[58:59] i challenge the two soul people on that
[59:01] one
[59:03] people that are around the world today
[59:05] teaching that message saying that
[59:07] brother branham said the soul is just
[59:09] the nature of the spirit i want one
[59:10] quote for that sound
[59:13] brother brown said the soul is the
[59:14] nature of the spirit because when you
[59:16] say just you're making it something that
[59:18] is not you well you're just being
[59:20] sarcastic amen
[59:23] but when we get up to heaven
[59:25] one of these days you'll thank me for
[59:27] being sarcastic
[59:33] you might find out it might be the holy
[59:34] spirit
[59:36] see then that's what you got to worry
[59:37] about
[59:39] all right
[59:40] but now watch
[59:45] let me get a little part of what i want
[59:47] to get to
[59:53] what is a nature
[1:00:00] what is a nature
[1:00:08] a nature is what anything is
[1:00:12] bird dog has the nature of a bird dog
[1:00:17] cow nature of a cow horse whatever
[1:00:20] animal the nature of that
[1:00:24] but what about a nature
[1:00:30] you know if we see this correctly
[1:00:35] i believe we'll be able to understand
[1:00:37] some things that has been withholding
[1:00:39] from us
[1:00:41] for quite a while
[1:00:43] wrote around says
[1:00:45] how do you know his nature
[1:00:51] he said you watch it
[1:00:56] how do you know the nature of anything
[1:00:58] you watch it
[1:01:00] you know then that way
[1:01:02] i can do as he said
[1:01:05] that if you can't see christ
[1:01:08] in every verse of the bible
[1:01:12] he said go back and read it again you
[1:01:13] missed it well what is christ the nature
[1:01:16] of god
[1:01:18] no it's the anointing
[1:01:21] well praise the lord i'm glad you said
[1:01:22] that
[1:01:25] because anointing is what a nature is
[1:01:31] if not tell me how come the bird dog
[1:01:33] comes into the world pointing
[1:01:36] who taught it
[1:01:42] come on you don't teach the word dog to
[1:01:43] point
[1:01:46] you teach him what to do about it you
[1:01:47] know not to run the birds off and thing
[1:01:49] but he comes into the world and he'll
[1:01:51] just walk out through there and all at
[1:01:52] once he'll just
[1:01:55] heal this point
[1:01:58] that's his nature
[1:02:01] and see well the way i see it i can
[1:02:03] follow the nature of god all the way
[1:02:06] through the bible
[1:02:09] and not have to change that nature
[1:02:12] in any way
[1:02:14] to fit a point or a doctrine or a
[1:02:16] thought
[1:02:18] and i can see his nature all the way
[1:02:19] through the word then i can see when
[1:02:21] jesus christ came he had the very nature
[1:02:25] that's right
[1:02:28] oh god
[1:02:30] you remember
[1:02:31] as i said a moment ago but one said i
[1:02:34] thought as a child that jesus loved me
[1:02:36] and god hated me he said until i found
[1:02:38] out you're the self-same person
[1:02:41] when there's not a nature of the father
[1:02:45] it's mean and arrogant
[1:02:47] boy just kidding i just you know
[1:02:50] into the nature of the sun is sweet
[1:02:53] and humble
[1:02:56] and then what kind of one you're going
[1:02:57] to give the holy ghost
[1:02:59] you know
[1:03:02] if the holy ghost is not the nature of
[1:03:04] the father then what kind of
[1:03:06] what have you got
[1:03:08] and if the father is not the nature of
[1:03:10] the son what do you got
[1:03:17] nature
[1:03:19] let us make man
[1:03:22] in our
[1:03:23] nature
[1:03:25] oh you changed that
[1:03:30] let us make man in our own image
[1:03:34] after our likeness
[1:03:38] and let them
[1:03:41] amen not just adam and jesus and brother
[1:03:44] branham
[1:03:45] there's one big man in this message he
[1:03:47] said he said the third pool was for
[1:03:48] jesus and brother branham and we're just
[1:03:51] riding along
[1:03:53] well i remember where the prophet said
[1:03:55] the third pool was for the bride and for
[1:03:57] the church and to the totally lost
[1:04:00] so you know which one i'm going to
[1:04:02] please right
[1:04:04] but what about it
[1:04:09] image likeness
[1:04:12] is what
[1:04:14] genesis 1 26 can't be something made in
[1:04:17] the image of it as we think
[1:04:21] because you're making a duplicate
[1:04:23] you know no um
[1:04:27] can't be that
[1:04:31] image is what anything is
[1:04:34] right
[1:04:36] likeness is what anything is
[1:04:40] god didn't have any problems saying let
[1:04:42] us make man in our own image in our own
[1:04:44] likeness
[1:04:49] because he was going to make man in the
[1:04:50] nature that he was
[1:04:54] will you go with that
[1:04:58] he's going to make man in his own nature
[1:05:01] her image which doesn't mean as another
[1:05:04] person
[1:05:08] genesis 1 26 the spiritual manner 27
[1:05:12] the physical man is in two
[1:05:15] genesis 1 26 and 27 is a spiritual man
[1:05:19] created in the image of a spiritual god
[1:05:23] now let's get it right
[1:05:27] if our thoughts of the godhead is
[1:05:29] correct
[1:05:30] that it's not father son holy ghost
[1:05:33] blessed trinity three gods or whatever
[1:05:36] it's
[1:05:38] god moving over in another form to
[1:05:41] reveal itself
[1:05:49] well see then if he creates man in his
[1:05:51] own image
[1:05:53] what image was the man in the garden
[1:05:56] the prophet said he was a spiritual
[1:05:58] being
[1:05:59] he said he even ruled the animals
[1:06:02] he named those animals
[1:06:05] in that spiritual supernatural being
[1:06:12] now what happened to that spiritual
[1:06:14] being
[1:06:19] i thought
[1:06:21] that genesis
[1:06:23] 1 was put into genesis 2.
[1:06:27] that's that's what i thought
[1:06:30] or how many genesis you got
[1:06:33] and that genesis 1 was placed into
[1:06:36] genesis 2
[1:06:38] and then that made adam in complete
[1:06:40] control
[1:06:43] of the garden and all of the things
[1:06:51] see we're not looking at it in the order
[1:06:53] that we need to be looking at it
[1:06:58] let us create man in our own image
[1:07:01] let them have dominion
[1:07:04] all right
[1:07:06] little branham says there he said he
[1:07:07] created man
[1:07:09] he said not a man
[1:07:12] he created man
[1:07:15] in his own image
[1:07:18] all right
[1:07:21] that man was
[1:07:24] god in another form
[1:07:32] told you we're gonna have to do some
[1:07:34] thinking
[1:07:37] or else he was not in the image of god
[1:07:44] if he was in the image of god then it
[1:07:46] would have the man that he created would
[1:07:48] have to be god in another
[1:07:49] form
[1:07:51] or where did he change
[1:07:55] no no now well i want you to explain it
[1:07:59] i want you to explain
[1:08:01] how you become a child of god
[1:08:09] i thought a child of god was god in
[1:08:11] another form
[1:08:14] i thought a son of god was god in
[1:08:15] another form
[1:08:18] what do you think
[1:08:19] right
[1:08:21] well that's that's just a little bit too
[1:08:23] much brother dale on to that human being
[1:08:25] i ain't talking about that human being
[1:08:28] as human being you're looking at was
[1:08:30] made in the image of a buyer and a
[1:08:33] horse and a dog and a donkey and
[1:08:35] anything in the world you want to make
[1:08:37] it
[1:08:40] but inside
[1:08:42] is a man
[1:08:44] if we have the new birth
[1:08:47] that is in the image of god
[1:08:50] which i thought paul said
[1:08:53] that it was christ in you
[1:08:58] the hope of glory
[1:09:01] i thought the prophet explained that the
[1:09:03] new birth was christ coming and living
[1:09:05] in us
[1:09:07] in the person of jesus christ
[1:09:21] brother they'll the way you're bringing
[1:09:23] it's going to be crowded
[1:09:28] you know what i mean
[1:09:31] you just keep cutting too much in
[1:09:36] just saying what the bible says
[1:09:39] you tell me some other way
[1:09:43] see what you believe
[1:09:45] if you really get down to it you believe
[1:09:48] you are a child of jesus which was a
[1:09:50] child of god
[1:09:57] i believe jesus was god made manifest in
[1:09:59] human flesh and i believe by the new
[1:10:02] birth that we are god made manifest in
[1:10:04] the human flesh
[1:10:06] now if you don't believe that's right i
[1:10:08] want to know what's right then now we'll
[1:10:10] back up a step then you know what
[1:10:14] none of us can be the fullness
[1:10:20] so you know what we are
[1:10:22] apart
[1:10:23] amen
[1:10:28] apart
[1:10:31] and you know what
[1:10:33] i'm a part of you and you're part of me
[1:10:35] and we're part of each other
[1:10:38] and you know all together
[1:10:40] we make up the body of christ
[1:10:49] what are you talking about
[1:10:53] are you talking about another god that
[1:10:56] makes this or a father son in holy ghost
[1:10:58] some way to make it come out to a story
[1:11:04] no
[1:11:09] i believe it's the most beautiful story
[1:11:11] that's ever been
[1:11:12] that's right it's the story of
[1:11:14] redemption
[1:11:19] and then i have no problems with brother
[1:11:21] branham
[1:11:22] in what he says
[1:11:25] that all souls was created before the
[1:11:27] world
[1:11:36] i have no problems with
[1:11:38] what is it is it deuteronomy
[1:11:41] 18 4
[1:11:43] all souls are mine
[1:11:49] and you know that even a sinner
[1:11:52] because we were all that and what why
[1:11:54] don't we want to be such a great big
[1:11:56] thing
[1:11:57] what's the difference in us in the
[1:11:58] center
[1:12:00] the new birth
[1:12:03] because we all begin as lost
[1:12:06] amen
[1:12:08] the only difference is the new birth
[1:12:15] see because we all come from god
[1:12:18] even a sinner come from god it's all had
[1:12:20] to come from god but around you is the
[1:12:22] word permitted
[1:12:28] because we were all permitted to come
[1:12:30] into the world lost
[1:12:35] what are you thinking about
[1:12:40] you see what i'm driving at
[1:12:44] that all of those attributes
[1:12:48] all of those things is the condescending
[1:12:50] of god
[1:12:58] and whatever we are remember the bible
[1:13:00] says
[1:13:02] it is he that hath made us and not we
[1:13:05] ourselves
[1:13:06] we are his people want the sheep of his
[1:13:09] pastor
[1:13:11] ever what we are god made us
[1:13:14] all right
[1:13:17] then why do we have any trouble with his
[1:13:19] nature
[1:13:22] he said yeah but brother dale an
[1:13:24] anointed one has his nature i differ
[1:13:26] with you
[1:13:28] i differ with you soully
[1:13:32] they do not have his nature they have
[1:13:33] his anointing
[1:13:39] because his nature is his being amen
[1:13:43] if they had his being they wouldn't be
[1:13:46] called anointed ones
[1:13:48] they would be the true anointed ones
[1:13:52] which would be his children
[1:13:56] his offspring
[1:14:00] but we don't think about the new birth
[1:14:05] see i'm trying to lay down a part all
[1:14:07] right then we'll get back because i just
[1:14:09] literally insert and then go down and
[1:14:11] then get over later
[1:14:13] about his nature
[1:14:16] i will go ahead and
[1:14:18] and express the words where you'll at
[1:14:20] least think that i know i'm going
[1:14:21] somewhere
[1:14:23] the nature of your soul is god if you're
[1:14:25] born again
[1:14:27] that's on souls in prison
[1:14:29] but said if not it's of the world
[1:14:33] i quoted that to a two soul man one time
[1:14:35] and he said how can a nature have a
[1:14:38] nature
[1:14:39] i said i don't know why don't you talk
[1:14:42] to the prophet
[1:14:45] that's what i said
[1:14:47] i said because he's once said it right
[1:14:49] amen
[1:14:51] he said the nature of your soul is god
[1:14:53] if you're born again if not it's of the
[1:14:55] world
[1:15:00] it's pretty easy to follow the worldly
[1:15:03] nature through the bible
[1:15:05] right right
[1:15:08] right now i mean you follow the worldly
[1:15:10] nature through the bible from the
[1:15:11] genesis of the council sin and and the
[1:15:14] building of the towers and doing the
[1:15:16] things the ark the covenant you know
[1:15:17] that
[1:15:18] but what about following god's nature
[1:15:26] see his nature was back there
[1:15:28] but was never been able it was never
[1:15:30] able to be displayed the way he wanted
[1:15:33] it in the old
[1:15:36] testament because he was fighting the
[1:15:39] nature of man
[1:15:44] and he could not
[1:15:46] convert the man
[1:15:49] so he had to come
[1:15:51] remember the quote
[1:15:53] didn't trust another
[1:15:55] he had to come himself
[1:15:57] to make a way
[1:16:00] if he could change our nature
[1:16:07] what does it mean to take the nature of
[1:16:10] a hog out and put the nature of a pig in
[1:16:16] we quote that a lot don't we
[1:16:20] but we only quote that if you take the
[1:16:22] hog's nature out put the nature of the
[1:16:24] you know and put in the nature of a lamb
[1:16:27] that the lamb will go up on the hill and
[1:16:29] eat grass
[1:16:31] right
[1:16:33] why
[1:16:36] he still looks like a hog he still
[1:16:38] smells like a hog
[1:16:44] right
[1:16:45] he still makes pork chops
[1:16:50] he don't make lamb chops
[1:16:55] it don't change a bit of the taste of
[1:16:57] the animal
[1:17:00] right
[1:17:02] are you following me
[1:17:04] it changes the nature of the animal
[1:17:10] now what is the nature of that animal
[1:17:20] so evidently a hog has a nature and a
[1:17:22] pig i mean a lamb has a nature
[1:17:28] and what is that nature
[1:17:32] but you know man has a nature
[1:17:37] right
[1:17:40] and you know the reason man has a nature
[1:17:42] because god has a nature
[1:17:45] and he's created in the image of god
[1:17:48] so he has a nature about him
[1:17:52] now what is that nature
[1:18:01] how can you have within you
[1:18:04] your own self
[1:18:07] and god at the same time
[1:18:14] of course you know what a lot of people
[1:18:15] want to do they want to take out all
[1:18:17] samuel dale you know and throw him away
[1:18:20] and put god in well you know what that
[1:18:23] don't make samuel
[1:18:26] right
[1:18:27] that means god
[1:18:30] you just goofed up
[1:18:33] you got to leave samuel dale
[1:18:38] and then you got to give him eternal
[1:18:40] life
[1:18:41] was eternal life just uh
[1:18:43] okay there it is she this this is me
[1:18:47] one drop
[1:18:51] it's eternal
[1:18:57] the only way you can get eternal and i'm
[1:18:58] saying this for later you're going to
[1:19:00] catch on
[1:19:02] is to get the nature of god
[1:19:05] you got to get a pig transplant
[1:19:09] right you're going to get a transplant
[1:19:10] from a pig
[1:19:12] to a lamb
[1:19:14] right
[1:19:16] that's right
[1:19:17] still look like a pig smell like a pig
[1:19:21] and to some degree you're going to act
[1:19:23] like a pig
[1:19:28] but inside of you is the nature of the
[1:19:30] lamb
[1:19:34] but remember
[1:19:37] if you just take something out and shove
[1:19:40] something in
[1:19:42] that's not a hog anymore
[1:19:44] i don't care what it looks like
[1:19:48] it's a lamb
[1:19:49] if that's the way you're going
[1:19:51] you want to go to what's going to find
[1:19:52] out when it gets old in the philippines
[1:19:54] they're going to take you my turn say
[1:19:56] wait do you want some roasted
[1:19:58] pig
[1:20:01] and he's going to say yes
[1:20:04] so we'll go down to this place where
[1:20:06] they roast the pig
[1:20:11] and what does a pig look like to me and
[1:20:13] you
[1:20:16] a little round plump thing with short
[1:20:19] legs
[1:20:20] and a snout and a body you know
[1:20:23] and when he walks out there he's going
[1:20:25] to look up there and they're going to
[1:20:26] say you want some of that pig and he
[1:20:28] says that ain't no big
[1:20:31] because you know what they're pigs now
[1:20:32] they got pigs
[1:20:34] but you know what their basic pig looks
[1:20:36] like
[1:20:38] a scant down germans a skin down uh
[1:20:41] bulldog one of the taller bulldog forms
[1:20:44] not the old chunky going down more or
[1:20:46] less the taller looking pug knows
[1:20:48] bulldogs i don't know what you call them
[1:20:51] but
[1:20:51] that's what you look just like
[1:20:55] well he's going to wonder what nature
[1:20:56] that thing's got
[1:21:04] but you see folks
[1:21:08] the nature of god
[1:21:12] has to be in the man
[1:21:15] that's right
[1:21:18] and then when it does
[1:21:22] it's no longer you living
[1:21:25] it's christ living in you
[1:21:31] and then one of these days we're going
[1:21:32] to realize it i'm going to quit right
[1:21:34] here
[1:21:36] one of these days we're going to realize
[1:21:38] all of these words brother branham used
[1:21:40] and you'll find out that i've been
[1:21:42] deliberately leading you up to a certain
[1:21:44] place to where i could say certain
[1:21:46] things
[1:21:48] and
[1:21:49] one of those things is
[1:21:52] is that
[1:21:55] your soul is your theophany
[1:22:00] that's what brother branham said
[1:22:05] now you're gonna have to argue with him
[1:22:12] you see we're going to find out one of
[1:22:13] these days this whole story of
[1:22:15] redemption is true
[1:22:18] brother branham says emphatically from
[1:22:20] about 64 on 63
[1:22:23] strongly emphatically if you wasn't over
[1:22:25] there you'll never be over there right
[1:22:31] you know what if he hadn't come from
[1:22:33] there we wouldn't be here at all
[1:22:38] you mean are you going to try to get
[1:22:39] into self-existence right
[1:22:41] i believe in self-existing
[1:22:44] i believe god is self-existing
[1:22:47] i believe the eternal life you have
[1:22:49] today existed in god before the world
[1:22:52] ever begun
[1:22:55] that's self-existing
[1:22:57] then that's not self-existing as of me
[1:23:01] because remember even the body of jesus
[1:23:05] wasn't self-existing
[1:23:10] so get away from that
[1:23:12] and get to thinking about the things
[1:23:14] your prophet had to say
[1:23:17] if i'd said the things
[1:23:19] if you had said the things to me
[1:23:22] ten years ago or whatever that i've said
[1:23:25] to you in the past three or four
[1:23:26] services
[1:23:30] my wife can tell you when i came into
[1:23:32] the message
[1:23:33] it was no problem because you've heard
[1:23:35] me tell the story
[1:23:36] of listening to
[1:23:38] or reading six books in one day and
[1:23:40] listening to two tapes
[1:23:44] i rejected my family i
[1:23:46] set aside myself to learn what the
[1:23:48] prophet had to say
[1:23:51] i read constantly i
[1:23:53] i meditated i wrote notes i wrote
[1:23:56] great books of things the prophet had
[1:23:59] said we didn't have a concordances like
[1:24:02] you have we didn't have none of those
[1:24:04] things and we would take a tape recorder
[1:24:06] and we'd write down what the prophet
[1:24:08] said and to do that you'd be surprised
[1:24:11] how many words you're going to miss
[1:24:14] if you think you can ride as fast as
[1:24:16] brother branham talks
[1:24:18] and keep the thought
[1:24:20] i invite you to try it
[1:24:23] and then go back and read the tape i
[1:24:25] mean go back and read your notes your
[1:24:28] notes and turn the tape back and listen
[1:24:30] to what he said
[1:24:32] but we done that to try to have the
[1:24:34] message
[1:24:36] even the doctrinal quotes and the things
[1:24:39] of the quote books that were put out i
[1:24:42] got everyone i could get because it may
[1:24:44] have been 10-15 pages to prove their
[1:24:46] point but they had a lot of quotes in
[1:24:47] there that was right
[1:24:49] well you know what i have no problems
[1:24:51] with getting their book i still got some
[1:24:53] of them
[1:24:55] my point
[1:25:00] is it stirred up within you
[1:25:03] anything to think about
[1:25:06] attributes
[1:25:09] son of god
[1:25:10] logos theophany's the thing the prophet
[1:25:13] has expressed to us
[1:25:15] has it stirred that up to you until you
[1:25:17] desire to listen to tapes
[1:25:21] i've told you i was not going to ask how
[1:25:23] many has even read or listened to
[1:25:26] questions and answers on genesis and i'd
[1:25:28] probably say three quarters of people in
[1:25:30] the building have not done it
[1:25:34] and i just simply ask you to
[1:25:37] because that's a great message to
[1:25:38] explain it
[1:25:41] explaining the creation of things
[1:25:45] i know all about it
[1:25:47] okay
[1:25:52] okay i pray to god you do
[1:25:56] i pray that you know all about it
[1:26:00] as i said while ago do we need to know
[1:26:02] these things well do we need to know the
[1:26:04] truth on one true and living god
[1:26:10] right to know who you are
[1:26:16] how many of you had your ideas that all
[1:26:19] god was he poured into christ
[1:26:22] nothing over there
[1:26:24] all christ poured into church
[1:26:26] nothing over there
[1:26:34] you see sometimes it takes somebody to
[1:26:36] come along just jog you a little bit get
[1:26:37] you to thinking
[1:26:40] get you to thinking
[1:26:42] that's all i'm trying to do is get you
[1:26:43] to think about who you are
[1:26:46] because we've reached a thing now
[1:26:48] talking about what
[1:26:51] let us make man in our own image
[1:26:55] and to know that whatever god he is you
[1:26:58] and i must be there
[1:27:00] or we're not in his
[1:27:02] image because he didn't make the
[1:27:05] physical man in his image
[1:27:10] he made the spiritual man in his image
[1:27:15] and you know what you take out the
[1:27:16] spiritual man
[1:27:18] and stand him over here in a form called
[1:27:20] a theophany
[1:27:22] you know what he looks like
[1:27:26] you
[1:27:30] look like you right
[1:27:34] think on these things
[1:27:36] what do you think about one true and
[1:27:38] living god
[1:27:43] what do you think about
[1:27:46] the end time
[1:27:48] and what you and i have received
[1:27:50] amen
[1:27:52] to know the truth
[1:27:54] shall set you free
[1:27:56] but do we need to know all of these
[1:27:58] things about god
[1:28:00] you don't want to know about god
[1:28:04] you don't understand what your thinking
[1:28:06] is when you say that
[1:28:08] when you would think well do we need to
[1:28:09] know all about god
[1:28:11] we need to know all about god that we
[1:28:13] can understand on this side because one
[1:28:15] of these days we're going to be on
[1:28:16] another side
[1:28:21] and you know what
[1:28:26] i don't believe foolish virgins will
[1:28:28] know what we know about god when we get
[1:28:30] over there
[1:28:32] so if you don't want to know about god
[1:28:34] might you might be degrading yourself to
[1:28:36] a foolish virgin
[1:28:38] that doesn't want to know
[1:28:46] am i right
[1:28:47] the foolish virgins can't be the bride
[1:28:49] of jesus christ
[1:28:52] come on did the prophet say he whispers
[1:28:55] secrets
[1:28:57] to his little bride
[1:29:02] that the rest don't hear
[1:29:06] they may hear words
[1:29:07] they may hear tapes
[1:29:10] but they don't hear
[1:29:12] in their heart
[1:29:17] think on these things let's stand
[1:29:24] he never sent a son he came himself
[1:29:30] so the one that was the creator that we
[1:29:31] covered sunday that the bible says all
[1:29:34] things were made by jesus christ and
[1:29:36] without him was not anything made that
[1:29:39] was made
[1:29:40] hebrews 1 john 1 colossians 1
[1:29:44] revelations 4 james 3.
[1:29:52] in the beginning was the word the word
[1:29:54] with god in the word was god
[1:29:57] and all things were created by him
[1:30:01] who the word
[1:30:04] and jesus christ was that word
[1:30:13] think on these things
[1:30:15] what about his nature
[1:30:21] what about the statement that the soul
[1:30:23] is the nature
[1:30:25] of the spirit
[1:30:29] he didn't say the soul is the spirit
[1:30:32] he said the soul is the nature of the
[1:30:34] spirit
[1:30:37] well now that nature has got to be
[1:30:38] greater than a spiritual part
[1:30:41] you know what a main spirit
[1:30:44] or it's not the real you
[1:30:49] i know i'm throwing out a lot of things
[1:30:52] but i'm throwing them out to where that
[1:30:54] you in your mind it'll be recorded
[1:30:57] and then when you read and listen to the
[1:30:59] message you'll say
[1:31:01] there it is
[1:31:04] that's what he said
[1:31:07] see because it takes god to reveal it
[1:31:11] see what the prophet said we need is
[1:31:13] what he said we need a nature change
[1:31:16] is that true
[1:31:23] he said it wasn't your soul that died
[1:31:29] he said it was the nature of your soul
[1:31:32] it's what died
[1:31:36] that's soul's in prison
[1:31:42] what about it church what do you think
[1:31:44] about god and what do you think about
[1:31:45] who you are
[1:31:47] and i thought brother branham said when
[1:31:48] the bride realizes who she is
[1:31:51] that satan will be powerless before
[1:31:55] but we don't want to know who we are we
[1:31:56] just want to go go to church and be good
[1:31:58] and
[1:31:59] rejoice and
[1:32:00] you know well if we'd have been over
[1:32:02] brother show and so we just been running
[1:32:04] the aisles and shouting glory hallelujah
[1:32:07] okay
[1:32:09] let's go over
[1:32:10] there
[1:32:12] i said no problem
[1:32:14] church wouldn't build over the basis of
[1:32:15] begging nobody to come here
[1:32:20] you come here by your own free moral
[1:32:22] agency choice
[1:32:27] go ahead brother what we got
[1:32:29] 172
[1:32:30] spiral the sun it will never go down
[1:32:43] it will never
[1:32:45] go down
[1:32:48] the
[1:32:49] flowers are blooming foreign
[1:32:57] just simply talking about one god
[1:33:01] just simply talking about a new verse
[1:33:19] foreign
[1:33:34] i
[1:33:43] the
[1:33:43] flowers are blooming
[1:34:01] in that city after sun
[1:34:05] it will never
[1:34:06] go down
[1:34:10] the
[1:34:10] flowers are

[1:34:14] the altar is open
[1:34:16] and the sun
[1:34:18] it will never
