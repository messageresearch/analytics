[39:16] which God gave unto him to show and to
[39:19] his servants things which must shortly
[39:20] come to pass and he sent and signified
[39:22] it by his Angel unto his servant John
[39:26] who bear record of the word of God and
[39:28] of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of
[39:30] all things that he saw blessed is he
[39:33] that readeth and they that hear the
[39:34] words of this prophecy and keep those
[39:36] things which are written therein for the
[39:39] time is at hand now let's go over to
[39:42] Revelations
[39:45] 5 and uh we'll begin reading about verse
[39:49] 5
[39:51] through1 one the Elder saith unto me
[39:54] weep not behold the lon of the tribe of
[39:56] Judah the root of David hath prevailed
[39:58] to open the book and to loose the Seven
[40:00] Seals thereof and I beheld and low in
[40:03] the midst of the throne and in the in
[40:05] the and of the four beast and in the
[40:08] midst of the elders stood a lamb as it
[40:10] had been slain having seven horns and
[40:12] seven eyes which are the seven spirits
[40:14] of God sent forth into all the Earth and
[40:17] he came and took the book out of the
[40:19] right hand of him that set upon the
[40:21] throne and when he had taken the book
[40:23] The Four beast and four and 20 Elders
[40:25] fell down down before the lamb having
[40:28] every one of them Harps and golden vows
[40:31] full of odors which are the prayers of
[40:34] the Saints and they sang a new song
[40:37] saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book
[40:39] and to open the seals thereof for thou
[40:42] thou was slain and has redeemed us to
[40:45] God by thy blood out of every Kindred
[40:48] and tongue and people and nation and has
[40:50] made us unto our God Kings and Priests
[40:54] and we shall reign on the Earth you may
[40:57] be seated the Lord add his Blessing to
[40:59] the reading of the word now I'm going to
[41:02] try to finish up this
[41:06] series on the words of this
[41:11] prophecy this afternoon you notice I
[41:13] said try cuz I was fully intending to uh
[41:18] just speak a little bit and have
[41:19] questions and answers on this and and I
[41:22] see a couple of of loopholes you know
[41:25] maybe
[41:26] in uh where the things that I should
[41:28] bring out in other words so I'm going to
[41:30] continue on through today and the Lord
[41:34] willing we try to end it up this
[41:36] afternoon if we have time we will have
[41:38] comments questions and answers upon what
[41:41] I've been talking on and it's like I
[41:43] told them last night at the Bible study
[41:45] you know write down your questions and
[41:47] thoughts when they come to you because
[41:50] if you're like me you know and all of
[41:52] you are not 70 but some of you are and
[41:55] by the time time that you think about
[41:57] something if you don't write it down
[41:59] then it's gone and we have then what we
[42:03] sing the song Precious Memories you know
[42:06] cuz we can't remember nothing about it
[42:09] you know so we we need to write them
[42:12] down so write them down and turn them in
[42:14] and we'll try to cover them you know if
[42:16] we need to take services on it but uh
[42:18] I've got a little something next Sunday
[42:20] that I want to speak on and that's one
[42:23] reason I wanted to transfer the
[42:25] communion over
[42:26] uh not because it'll just be lenty this
[42:28] afternoon but I have a reason for for
[42:31] wanting to uh do it I wish you would
[42:35] before next Sunday I was fully intending
[42:39] to start with on the Sunday afternoon to
[42:42] pray play the tape of brother brandom
[42:46] preaching on the communion you know
[42:48] there in ' 65 right but I just decided
[42:51] Well you play it you listen to it you
[42:54] know he explains the the uh things the
[42:58] conditions Etc uh about communion and
[43:03] who it's far and things like that so I
[43:06] would ask you to either read the book or
[43:08] listen to the tape on communion uh by
[43:11] next Sunday and that way we won't play
[43:13] the tape we will uh we would do it but I
[43:16] was intended to just play it the other
[43:18] night we were listening to it and I
[43:20] thought that would be good to play right
[43:21] before communion time would be just to
[43:24] play that one in' 65 you know and it
[43:26] would be good I you know may still do it
[43:29] if I could get my thoughts together to
[43:31] bring everything the way I want to
[43:35] now I hope that after this is message 20
[43:39] on this and after reading this scripture
[43:43] here in Revelations 1 I hope that we're
[43:46] getting something uh out of it to
[43:50] understand you know the point that I've
[43:53] been trying to bring all now I I want to
[43:56] bring this to you over and over and over
[44:00] and I may mention it two or three times
[44:02] this morning two or three times this
[44:04] afternoon because it is a point that I
[44:07] believe is very vital I don't believe
[44:10] that we're looking at the Book of
[44:12] Revelations in the way that we should I
[44:15] know it is the future uh of the church
[44:19] and the things but it's also what has
[44:21] been you know what is and and all like
[44:24] that but what I want you to think on is
[44:28] see I believe our mind is not locked on
[44:30] one I believe it's locked on one point
[44:33] and we need to unlock it maybe that's
[44:35] not the correct way to say it but that's
[44:37] the best way I know to say it that you
[44:40] know sometimes we get our mind set in a
[44:43] Channel all right unless something goes
[44:46] in there and clicks that you know it it
[44:49] will you know you're only going to get
[44:52] out of a computer what they call it
[44:55] trash in out is that the words that's
[44:57] that's used and and you know you only
[45:00] get what's in there well you know
[45:03] sometimes you got to you got to change
[45:05] things around so I want you to think
[45:07] about now cuz I believe that's where
[45:09] people are missing it and we'll get to
[45:12] it this afternoon more of why they're
[45:15] believing brother brandom was the one
[45:17] that come to John on patmas now I I
[45:19] don't believe that because that would be
[45:21] pre-existence and see then you say well
[45:23] it was uh John was transferred over to
[45:27] this day well still be careful because
[45:31] what would be that other word one of
[45:32] them's pre and other's post is that the
[45:34] way it a pro you know in other words
[45:36] coming over you got a problem there and
[45:40] like w says about it then if you want to
[45:42] transfer over here and say that well you
[45:45] know this is the way we see that he was
[45:47] transferred over well then how come
[45:48] brother random was was you know
[45:51] incorrect on his understanding of the
[45:54] seals and things right uh looked like he
[45:56] would have known about it if it was a
[45:58] you know a transfer as we think John was
[46:01] transferred over to where brother random
[46:02] was let's just leave it alone amen cuz
[46:05] see I think what our problem is we're
[46:07] looking at a point and not understanding
[46:10] it and what I think we need to look at
[46:12] it John was chosen to write the Book of
[46:16] Revelation right that's it now all right
[46:20] dyus were the messenger came to John
[46:25] right and I believe that was the prophet
[46:29] I've preached that to you we'll get more
[46:30] on this afternoon and show you more
[46:32] about it but I believe that was the
[46:35] prophet and he said it might have been
[46:37] Elijah but see you know just just we'll
[46:40] just get it in try to go on a little
[46:42] further but my point is let's deal with
[46:45] the writing John's dealing with the
[46:46] writing of the Book of Revelation he's
[46:48] not dealing with the end time of the the
[46:51] revealing right it had to take a prophet
[46:54] to come Amen in in the end time that's
[46:57] right to reveal it amen you know now you
[47:00] remember what we brought out I'll say
[47:02] this back off
[47:04] now that we were bringing out that that
[47:06] the uh you know the word only comes to
[47:10] the
[47:11] prophet well now I'll give you something
[47:14] to think about this
[47:16] evening and you see why it'll take me a
[47:18] long time to express
[47:20] it
[47:22] U Matthew Mark Luke and John would
[47:24] Prophets
[47:27] Peter wouldn't List It Paul's listed
[47:28] with the prophets brother R list him
[47:30] with now he lists the churches
[47:31] Messengers with the prophets now you
[47:33] know things like that but I'm talking
[47:34] about Major Prophets right for the word
[47:37] to come to
[47:39] right and you know that John on patmas
[47:43] wouldn't have made your
[47:44] profit so you better consider it amen
[47:47] you know it might pay for for us to
[47:49] listen and go back and listen over and
[47:52] over and over until we get it that may
[47:54] stir up your cure curiosity to get you
[47:57] to think about this evening okay now
[47:59] let's get down on what we're talking
[48:01] about see we've covered it over and over
[48:05] that this is the
[48:08] Revelation that God gave to Jesus
[48:13] Christ
[48:15] see to bring it to
[48:18] John and by doing that he sent it by an
[48:22] Angel right all right a messenger to
[48:27] come to John on patmas you all then we
[48:29] can tie it together and say the word
[48:32] come to the prophet but now what I want
[48:35] you to consider today is that I want you
[48:39] to look at something that I've tried for
[48:42] many many years to get us to see that
[48:45] the Bible shows you not as what you
[48:51] are now listen to what I'm saying right
[48:55] it doesn't show you you as a sinner
[48:57] right
[48:58] amen you say yes it does now I know I
[49:01] know the scriptures and Paul said we all
[49:03] had our conversation I know the
[49:05] scriptures but you listen to the
[49:09] point the Bible shows you how perfect
[49:11] you are that's right but we don't ever
[49:14] get on to that we just get on to how bad
[49:17] we
[49:18] are y well now if the
[49:22] sacrifice I'm asking that for your point
[49:25] now if
[49:26] the sacrifice in the Old Testament made
[49:28] the worshipper clean enough to be able
[49:32] to stand in the presence of
[49:35] God
[49:36] right and the high priest had to you
[49:39] know behind the
[49:40] veil and the sacrifice made that person
[49:43] perfect enough to stand there when we
[49:46] know that person that was standing there
[49:48] was not a born again believer that's
[49:50] right there was no new birth back there
[49:53] Jesus Christ hadn't died yet all right
[49:56] but now and he would go in with his
[49:59] thoughts and he'd come out and he'd
[50:00] still have his thoughts he he couldn't
[50:02] be changed that way but if that could
[50:05] show how perfect a person is what about
[50:08] the blood of Jesus
[50:09] Christ when are we going to believe what
[50:12] God has said about us right well brother
[50:15] Dale I I just do too okay stop doing the
[50:18] things wrong I'm not talking about that
[50:21] I'm not talking about a garbage Camp I'm
[50:23] not talking about well I can't help it
[50:25] so brother Dale said I'm perfect so I'll
[50:27] just go on live like the devil and I'll
[50:29] be perfect now you got a bad
[50:32] problem you've got a mental problem let
[50:35] alone a spiritual condition right to to
[50:38] think like that you know see so that
[50:40] would be entirely wrong it's not that
[50:42] it's doing it's it's the point of where
[50:45] that when we make mistakes we repent but
[50:48] we don't keep doing will I Repent of
[50:50] that today Lord I'll repent of it
[50:51] tomorrow so I'll repent next week so let
[50:53] me just do it two or three today where I
[50:55] want won't have to worry about next week
[50:56] that's Catholic right Penance paid for
[50:59] before you do those things and that
[51:01] won't work all right but see follow the
[51:05] point of what I'm talking
[51:08] about that the Bible shows us perfect
[51:11] that's right I've kept trying to tell
[51:14] you you can take Paul Peter James John
[51:17] you take all of the writing of the new
[51:19] testment and you'll find a
[51:22] prophecy you know you can read a
[51:25] prophecy of Paul talking about how
[51:28] perfect we are by the atonement amen but
[51:32] the Book of Revelation shows
[51:36] you as being already there
[51:40] right and how perfect you
[51:44] are cuz that's why I've always said it's
[51:46] your
[51:47] book that's it's your book bless you
[51:50] brother sweetie and good to see you amen
[51:52] bless you but we've been trying to cover
[51:55] now that it's the Revelation that God
[51:57] give to
[51:59] Jesus that's not trinitarianism right
[52:03] right that's the same thing as we showed
[52:04] about the writing of the
[52:06] Bible the the Revelation coming in the
[52:09] correct order see but Jesus did not know
[52:12] his part in the Kingdom that's
[52:16] right he said I only do what the father
[52:18] shows me all right see he limited his
[52:23] own self by dwelling in FL with us
[52:26] that's right to the point of not being
[52:28] able to know all
[52:30] things true right all right and in doing
[52:34] that then see why can't we believe it
[52:37] see that way you stay away from
[52:39] trinitarianism and you stay away from
[52:42] Oneness amen cuz if you're going to
[52:44] believe in Oneness you're going to have
[52:45] to believe that Jesus knowed everything
[52:47] and there was no problem because you're
[52:48] going to believe he's God right well I
[52:51] believe he was God but I believe the way
[52:53] he came
[52:56] he made his own limited condition to
[52:58] where that he wouldn't destroy us where
[53:01] he could come and live with us all right
[53:04] and see in that then he didn't know his
[53:07] part in the
[53:08] Kingdom but when he come see he said I
[53:11] go to God I come from God I go to God
[53:15] but then he come right back
[53:17] yeah well when he came back to John on
[53:20] patmas he did
[53:22] know right and would be able to I said a
[53:25] moment ago then to bring the Revelation
[53:28] to John that John could write it
[53:32] down right so we're dealing with the
[53:35] writing of the Book of Revelations right
[53:38] when brother brandom comes into view
[53:40] you're dealing with the revelation of
[53:43] the Book of
[53:44] Revelations all right we must have that
[53:47] in the end time had to have a prophet to
[53:49] come and tell us those things even
[53:52] though it was written
[53:53] down we had to have a prophet to come
[53:56] and tell us thank God for that just get
[53:58] it in the right order get the writing of
[54:00] the Book of Revelations first that's
[54:02] right right
[54:04] amen all right then we'll get the
[54:07] revealing of the Book of Revelation you
[54:10] that make us come to that point all
[54:12] right but see Jesus Christ after his
[54:14] death bual and Resurrection the prophet
[54:16] said and at the time he came here to
[54:20] John on patmas he knew all the things
[54:24] that would take place
[54:25] all right the kingdom that he would come
[54:28] to be talking about is the kingdom of
[54:31] the father right he would know his place
[54:33] in the Kingdom right he didn't know his
[54:36] place in the Kingdom now watch he knew
[54:38] he was come to die I preach that to you
[54:41] he knew he was coming to the world to
[54:43] die to release that life that was within
[54:46] him that the father's Kingdom could be
[54:48] made manifest but this is a natural
[54:51] thing maybe he thought he would just up
[54:53] and go away
[54:55] and the father's Kingdom would come into
[54:57] view but now he said I'll be with you
[55:00] even in you so he
[55:01] knew that something was going to happen
[55:04] here and it was going to be the kingdom
[55:07] inside of me and you that he was coming
[55:10] making a way see all right the then as
[55:13] we see it then the baptism of the Holy
[55:15] Ghost come on the day of Pentecost
[55:18] bringing into
[55:20] manifestation not the throne that Jesus
[55:22] spoke of that the two the wanted to know
[55:25] if one son could sit on one side and one
[55:27] the other she knew he was talking about
[55:29] some form of a kingdom but that wasn't
[55:32] the one that he was coming to make to
[55:34] bring into VI view or to make ready for
[55:37] it if he hadn't to come the way he came
[55:40] you know and died then the Father Strong
[55:44] could never been made manifest all right
[55:47] see because it wouldn't it wouldn't have
[55:49] never come into view but he come to make
[55:51] that manifest all right see which would
[55:53] be on the Earth and it would be then the
[55:56] father's Throne the prophet said down
[55:58] through seven Church ages that's why he
[56:00] died son of man Rose Son of God would be
[56:04] Son of God Through the Ages and then
[56:06] right in the end time just before the
[56:08] end of it you know he would come back as
[56:11] son of man that's right and then he can
[56:13] go as son of David all right now we've
[56:15] been over that over that over that so I
[56:17] hope it you know like some of said last
[56:19] night in the Bible study said you preach
[56:21] this and then you preach it over and you
[56:22] preach it over that's right I just
[56:24] approached it another way and just keep
[56:26] trying to bring it to where we can can
[56:28] get an understanding all right
[56:32] now we've covered the Book of
[56:35] Revelations in this
[56:38] much that in the Book of Revelations you
[56:42] do not
[56:44] see the Lord Jesus Christ by himself
[56:49] right that's why I've labeled it and
[56:51] called it the bride's book
[56:53] right cuz you don't see Jesus Christ by
[56:59] himself you always see
[57:02] him in the form of the church or in the
[57:08] church or you see him to Israel through
[57:11] two
[57:14] prophets even the lamb as we've read
[57:17] here in the Bible the lamb has seven
[57:19] horns and seven eyes and that's in Bride
[57:22] form right see and it that lamb come
[57:26] from the church
[57:29] ages that's right all right see then
[57:32] that we're dealing with as I said now
[57:34] remember we're dealing with the writing
[57:36] of the Book of Revelations
[57:38] amen don't get your thoughts into the
[57:40] revealing of it that's right see stay
[57:44] with me as I'm talking about the writing
[57:46] of the
[57:48] book and to getting it to the place that
[57:51] we can see all right so he's either
[57:53] shown with his bride
[57:55] in his bride are in those forms because
[57:58] we've been through it like Revelations
[58:00] 1:13 you know one standing in the midst
[58:03] of the seven golden Candlestick like
[58:05] unto the son of man G about the PS see
[58:08] feminis with a golden girdle you know
[58:10] Etc all right so we've been through
[58:12] those things trying to to bring it to a
[58:15] place to where we can see what God is
[58:18] saying about us the Book of Revelations
[58:21] is showing more of the future point of
[58:24] the church then it is to say the present
[58:27] state of the church all right the
[58:29] present state of this church is bad I'm
[58:32] talking about Lula Georgia I ain't
[58:34] worried about the world I ain't talking
[58:36] about denominationalism I'm talking
[58:38] about Lula Georgia okay anybody else
[58:40] wants to claim this as their Church home
[58:42] out there on internet
[58:43] listening we're in bad
[58:46] shape but we're in the best shape could
[58:48] ever be right cuz nothing's out a
[58:51] caterer that's what your Prophet said
[58:53] about it everything's right on time time
[58:55] it's supposed to be this way but we as
[58:57] individuals must deal with the basis of
[59:00] trying to get ourselves out of the way
[59:02] amen amen that God can come on the scene
[59:06] to to deal with you and I all right
[59:09] now so what are we talking
[59:12] about now keep in mind what I say
[59:15] you now you say you know and like I said
[59:19] when you're in the first grade you
[59:20] always you say 1 + 1 = 2 you don't go to
[59:24] 2 + 2 = 4 till 2 weeks later you're
[59:29] still on 1 + 1 = 2 all right so I keep
[59:34] repeating remember we're dealing with
[59:36] the writing of the Book of Revelation
[59:40] right not dealing with the revealing of
[59:43] the Book of Revelations right all right
[59:47] now but to promise to the
[59:51] Overcomer of each age shows a specific
[59:56] situation you know something related to
[59:59] uh then all
[1:00:02] right you know through the time but then
[1:00:05] it would show something as to coming
[1:00:08] into view as uh the
[1:00:12] future and the dealings of the things
[1:00:14] cuz when you get over to like Revelation
[1:00:16] 3:21 and all like that where it says he
[1:00:18] that overcomes will sit with me in my
[1:00:20] Throne as I've overcome sit with my
[1:00:21] father in his throne all right now we
[1:00:23] know where his Throne is at his throne
[1:00:25] is the millennial rign the son of David
[1:00:29] right that's the throne that he's
[1:00:31] speaking of right all right now that way
[1:00:35] then it shows like I said the Overcomer
[1:00:37] it shows where you're at so then what
[1:00:41] the prophet when he said the seals and
[1:00:43] things will show you what was what is
[1:00:46] and shall come all right so now it's a
[1:00:49] dealing with that all right son of David
[1:00:51] in the millennial Reign all right but to
[1:00:54] prepare for that Throne that would be
[1:00:57] the millennial Reign he had to come
[1:01:00] forth as the Son of God in you know he
[1:01:03] was son of man upon the Earth then he
[1:01:05] died son of man cuz you don't crucify
[1:01:08] the Son of God you died son of man where
[1:01:11] the baptism of the Holy Ghost the Son of
[1:01:13] God could come into the church and live
[1:01:15] in the hearts of the Saints and that
[1:01:17] would be the father strong right all
[1:01:20] right now then you would be see for just
[1:01:23] a moment the secret is that he is to
[1:01:26] come back in
[1:01:28] Bride in the end time not just brother
[1:01:31] Brandon right amen he was a son of
[1:01:35] man but the bride must be the son of
[1:01:39] man all right we've been through that
[1:01:41] see all right she must be the word made
[1:01:45] flesh around the world not just Lula
[1:01:48] Georgia that's right not just one church
[1:01:51] or one thing it's got to be around the
[1:01:53] world and it's got to be everybody
[1:01:56] catching their point so he returns in
[1:01:58] Bride
[1:02:02] form on
[1:02:05] earth now
[1:02:06] listen he returns as bride form on Earth
[1:02:10] in the bride right and that will
[1:02:16] match exactly Revelations 1:13 right
[1:02:21] right right now you remember the
[1:02:23] matching pieces about I don't know how
[1:02:26] many years ago and brother Ray is going
[1:02:28] to take a a little job that he thinks is
[1:02:31] going to be easy he said he had plenty
[1:02:33] of time at home and he's going to take a
[1:02:35] job of trying to get some of those older
[1:02:38] tapes of serieses and things that I
[1:02:41] preached on bringing them over from
[1:02:43] cassettes over to mp3s good luck cuz
[1:02:46] it's you know it takes a lot of time
[1:02:48] sitting there watching them gauges and
[1:02:50] making sure trying to filate us the same
[1:02:53] time okay but now see I preached a
[1:02:56] series matching pieces in other words
[1:02:57] what's on Earth got to match what's in
[1:02:59] heaven right when we that's the Rapture
[1:03:02] to me right see Martin Luther come forth
[1:03:05] with a just shall live by faith right
[1:03:08] now he matched what's in heaven about
[1:03:10] him right in the Bible the writing and
[1:03:13] when he did he had to go by the grave
[1:03:15] cuz he was nowhere to go all right see
[1:03:18] he couldn't walk off the earth in the
[1:03:19] Rapture cuz that was not the part he had
[1:03:21] to match right see this is the age when
[1:03:25] the matching part has to come forth to
[1:03:27] be able to see what went down remember
[1:03:30] the other day we bringing that out the
[1:03:31] grain of wheat what it went down has to
[1:03:33] come back am not just in the church ages
[1:03:37] but come back cuz it was the son of man
[1:03:39] that went down right amen all right so
[1:03:42] it's got to come back to son of man see
[1:03:45] on Earth and that matches what's in
[1:03:48] heaven because she's shown in
[1:03:49] Revelations 1:13 one standing in the
[1:03:52] midst of the gold seven golden
[1:03:53] Candlestick look
[1:03:54] says like unto the son of
[1:03:57] man see it didn't say the son of
[1:04:00] man like that because it's given us the
[1:04:02] key to understand that if it's like the
[1:04:05] son of man then it would be the son of
[1:04:07] man in a multiple form am not the son of
[1:04:11] man in one form see but it would be in a
[1:04:15] multiple form in the bride of Christ
[1:04:17] around the world see that would come to
[1:04:20] that place all right now and when she
[1:04:23] does see then that would be Jesus Christ
[1:04:26] in Bride form just like he was upon
[1:04:29] Earth amen y just like he was has got to
[1:04:33] be heing you and I amen right then that
[1:04:35] matches exactly what the Bible said we
[1:04:38] would
[1:04:39] be see we got to become what the Bible
[1:04:42] says we are right amen that's my whole
[1:04:44] point if you miss it of anything see the
[1:04:47] Bible tells us what we
[1:04:48] are we must become what we are right
[1:04:51] that's why I don't agree with the people
[1:04:53] the way they preach about you know we
[1:04:54] always was eternal I know with the
[1:04:56] quotes of the Prophet we'll get to
[1:04:59] that but I don't agree with the way
[1:05:01] they're Pro well I always was eternal
[1:05:03] don't matter what I done what this I was
[1:05:04] just Eternal well that make you an
[1:05:06] eternal sinner right amen this won't
[1:05:09] work when you match here What God Says
[1:05:11] About You everything's all right am but
[1:05:15] it won't be all right till we match it
[1:05:16] all right
[1:05:18] now us being then the son of
[1:05:22] man the word made flesh and the bride of
[1:05:25] Christ upon the Earth to match that that
[1:05:27] he spoke of the then is we would be the
[1:05:32] life form of
[1:05:34] God upon the Earth in this dispensation
[1:05:38] right now he'll go to the Jews in
[1:05:40] another dispensation that's right the
[1:05:43] Jews then will be be the LI form of God
[1:05:46] in that way but we're the LI form of God
[1:05:49] here on Earth because we're the alive
[1:05:50] word see in other words we're watch
[1:05:54] spoke of in the book right see what the
[1:05:58] book says we must become amen right now
[1:06:02] what if the book hadn't been
[1:06:05] written you wouldn't know what to be
[1:06:07] that's right right all right now I'm
[1:06:10] just you know I know the way I speak I
[1:06:13] say things funny but it makes you think
[1:06:16] see to take the writings without the
[1:06:19] Book of
[1:06:21] Revelations you know you you could see
[1:06:25] things but you could not see it in its
[1:06:27] Clarity right that's
[1:06:30] right CU Paul didn't say I looked up and
[1:06:33] saw the bride up in heaven
[1:06:35] see he he didn't say that he told us how
[1:06:39] to get there amen he told us how to Live
[1:06:41] While We're Here and prepare to go there
[1:06:44] that's right all
[1:06:46] right but see John on patmas is showing
[1:06:50] us already there right right amen right
[1:06:54] that's the writing of the book what's
[1:06:56] that when that book was written ad
[1:06:59] 9596 God saw the bride already
[1:07:03] there but we must become what he saw
[1:07:07] that's right that's right all right we
[1:07:11] must become everybody listening what he
[1:07:13] saw Yes but don't worry about it we will
[1:07:17] right you said well brother Dale I just
[1:07:19] got so many problem well that's the
[1:07:21] problem you're looking at the problems
[1:07:22] you ain't looking at what God Said right
[1:07:25] right why do you need an atonement right
[1:07:28] y well brother there if I'm Eternal all
[1:07:31] I don't need an atonement that's where
[1:07:32] the problem is that's what I told you
[1:07:34] the sister used to play the piano for
[1:07:36] she said who was I going to pray to said
[1:07:38] cuz me and brother Mo was preaching this
[1:07:40] in 1971 and
[1:07:44] two and she said the way it's being
[1:07:46] preached she said who do I pray to I'm
[1:07:50] him I said you went too far well it
[1:07:54] proved it because she didn't stay with
[1:07:55] the truth she back and went out in the
[1:07:58] world it proved she only had a mental
[1:08:02] conception cuz see she wasn't looking at
[1:08:04] what we were talking about CU we must
[1:08:06] match here what God sees
[1:08:09] there that's when we'll go right right
[1:08:13] we'll go when when we might hear what
[1:08:15] God sees us right and has already said
[1:08:17] about us but you know somebody will do
[1:08:19] it why cuz God said
[1:08:21] it but we got an opportunity to be part
[1:08:24] of it right that's our part to be part
[1:08:29] of that if we don't prepare ourselves
[1:08:30] for that cuz the Bible says his wife
[1:08:32] hath made herself ready right it didn't
[1:08:35] say he made his wife ready right we know
[1:08:39] he does right but she's got to make
[1:08:41] herself ready she's got to put on the
[1:08:43] wedding garment right which is a
[1:08:45] revealed word that's right well I'll
[1:08:48] just take it easy and God's going to
[1:08:49] that's the predestination we talk about
[1:08:52] denin I believe in predestination as
[1:08:54] much as I can believe it I'll get to it
[1:08:56] the Lord willing next weekend I believe
[1:08:58] in it just as much as can be I believe
[1:09:00] everybody in the world's
[1:09:02] predestinated one way or the other
[1:09:05] that's right some are predestinated
[1:09:06] under salvation some are predestinated
[1:09:08] under rep probation right I believe that
[1:09:12] but it's all by for knowledge of God
[1:09:14] right not that he chose it's because it
[1:09:17] is for knowledge all right now let I get
[1:09:20] on that get on another message so you
[1:09:23] see my mind it goes over there where I'm
[1:09:25] studying okay at least my thoughts am
[1:09:28] all right but now we
[1:09:31] see that we took a message and we
[1:09:34] preached about Revelations
[1:09:36] 4:1 as being the
[1:09:40] Rapture all right John taken up in 4:1
[1:09:44] is a type of the bride of Christ right
[1:09:49] all right so now as far as God is
[1:09:52] concerned and he's not concerned about
[1:09:55] you and I you say well now you say that
[1:09:58] and then you say we ought to be straight
[1:09:59] well that's that's our business that's
[1:10:01] our part of it he's not concerned about
[1:10:04] me and you and what we're
[1:10:06] doing he's already told us what we're
[1:10:09] going to do right now we may get a lot
[1:10:12] of weapons because we don't do what he
[1:10:15] wants us to do
[1:10:18] right okay that's our choice
[1:10:22] now now what what I'm getting
[1:10:26] at Revelations 4:1 shows the
[1:10:29] bride already in
[1:10:32] glory all right
[1:10:36] now CHS her already
[1:10:41] there goes on to chapter five and shows
[1:10:48] her and where the lamb came from Amen to
[1:10:53] take the book right
[1:10:55] y was from the church ages
[1:11:00] amen he said Bo I tell you what you
[1:11:03] that's where people don't get it right
[1:11:05] they look down at the church ages and
[1:11:06] they say boy all of that's a mess you
[1:11:09] know I told you before and I don't I'm
[1:11:11] not throwing off on nobody that's your
[1:11:12] belief but there's people that believe
[1:11:14] that like Luther and them didn't have
[1:11:16] nothing Wesley and them didn't have
[1:11:17] nothing Pentecost didn't have nothing
[1:11:19] but we got it all and that's the way
[1:11:22] they preach it when you do like that you
[1:11:24] don't have nothing to stand on either
[1:11:26] and you got a lamb with one
[1:11:29] horn you got a unicorn that's right
[1:11:33] right right and I according to my
[1:11:36] knowledge now I know they talk about it
[1:11:38] that it made didn't make it over on arcs
[1:11:40] reason it missed you know but I don't
[1:11:43] think that's right because I don't ever
[1:11:45] remember a unicorn like that now the
[1:11:47] Bible speaks of a unicorn but it's not
[1:11:49] talking about a one horned
[1:11:52] goat I know the Bible and what it says
[1:11:55] it talks about a unicorn it's not a one
[1:11:56] horn goat cuz according to my
[1:11:59] understanding never was a one-horn goat
[1:12:02] you know well see then you make yourself
[1:12:03] a unicorn because if you believe that
[1:12:06] we're the only ones that have
[1:12:08] it it's got to have seven horns and
[1:12:11] seven eyes and brother brand as I said a
[1:12:13] moment ago and I've discussed this with
[1:12:16] ministers in this message he said that
[1:12:18] those Church age Messengers were
[1:12:22] prophets well no ain't no way in the
[1:12:24] world even Paul wouldn't
[1:12:26] won see there Paul wouldn't even a
[1:12:28] prophet well he said he magnified his
[1:12:30] own
[1:12:32] office well you argue with him about
[1:12:35] it brother Ram said they were prophets
[1:12:38] not
[1:12:40] major no right there's prophets in the
[1:12:44] fivefold ministry but they're not Major
[1:12:46] Prophets right
[1:12:49] right the prophets in the fivefold
[1:12:51] ministry must get theirs
[1:12:54] from where that the prophet of that time
[1:12:56] brings the word that's right so that
[1:12:58] shows they're not major all right now
[1:13:00] listen I'm trying to get down to
[1:13:04] something CU see we're looking at the
[1:13:07] Book of
[1:13:09] Revelations I said the writing of the
[1:13:12] book all right now when John wrote the
[1:13:17] book then he got over to
[1:13:21] um you know in the writing he spoke of
[1:13:26] the church and how perfect she is right
[1:13:30] he spoke of the ages and how they would
[1:13:33] come down and that each age would be
[1:13:37] beautifully wonderfully decked out and
[1:13:40] would be able to bring forth that
[1:13:42] lamb but then he gets over and finds
[1:13:44] that the book is
[1:13:46] sealed well now I don't have much sense
[1:13:51] but plain language
[1:13:54] uh you don't seal a book until it's
[1:13:55] complete
[1:13:57] right you know that true you know it's
[1:14:02] complete all right now so God would look
[1:14:05] down and see it
[1:14:09] complete right
[1:14:12] right now there's things yet still to
[1:14:15] come that's in the
[1:14:17] Bible but when it was written to John on
[1:14:20] patmas it would be written as a complete
[1:14:23] book right and that book The Prophet
[1:14:26] then would say a seal with Seven Seals
[1:14:29] and those seals would show you what has
[1:14:31] been what is and shall come all right
[1:14:34] but it's a complete
[1:14:37] book all right now then if the if the
[1:14:40] lamb Through the
[1:14:43] Ages would come forth you know from the
[1:14:47] church then God is looking at her as a
[1:14:50] complete
[1:14:51] book right
[1:14:53] and seeing it
[1:14:55] finished all right and
[1:14:59] seeing everything already done
[1:15:02] right so he writes it to John you know
[1:15:05] John's to write that John is the Scribe
[1:15:08] right all brother R said it's the only
[1:15:11] book in the Bible whereas the Lord Jesus
[1:15:12] Christ come in personally to
[1:15:15] ascribe now so then he come to write the
[1:15:19] book so when God looks down Through the
[1:15:22] Ages he don't see our faults and favs
[1:15:24] yes in the ages he'll rebuke
[1:15:28] right but when he ends that age what
[1:15:31] does he
[1:15:33] say he always comes to the end of the
[1:15:36] age and gives a point of showing not
[1:15:40] only his Revelation you know of who he
[1:15:43] is but showing because each age has got
[1:15:45] a revelation of the deity of Jesus
[1:15:47] Christ you know the Sevenfold Glory of
[1:15:48] his person in the church age book read
[1:15:50] it that's right amen but it also shows
[1:15:53] the the bride that's right cuz it shows
[1:15:55] the Overcomer it didn't wait till the
[1:15:58] last age to speak of Overcomer each
[1:16:00] Church age he receives a message about
[1:16:03] the Overcomer all right now according to
[1:16:05] my understanding the prophet declares
[1:16:08] that each age receives what's previous
[1:16:11] right right all right so we would get
[1:16:13] the overcoming of every
[1:16:15] age amen what a wonderful
[1:16:18] opportunity we can see all of what the
[1:16:20] others will be able to receive amen we
[1:16:23] can see it while we're here right amen
[1:16:26] because we receive The Complete Book all
[1:16:28] right
[1:16:29] now but the book has to be
[1:16:33] completed all right now see then the
[1:16:36] book is the one that was the book that
[1:16:38] was to be sealed is
[1:16:42] who curious about all of the
[1:16:45] things but you know the Bible is really
[1:16:49] written about people amen right
[1:16:54] y when it talks about a beast rising
[1:16:58] up that's not a King Kong walking across
[1:17:01] the Earth you know sorry that's not
[1:17:04] exactly what it is you
[1:17:06] know that's in the people that's right
[1:17:10] and even though it's bad things it's
[1:17:12] still about people Armageddon is a great
[1:17:16] terrible Battle of the termination of
[1:17:18] forces but you know what it's about
[1:17:21] people right the Bible is written about
[1:17:25] people it's not written about houses and
[1:17:27] buildings and ships and boats and and
[1:17:31] things those are just things that are in
[1:17:33] there to tell you what age you're in or
[1:17:36] whatever the Bible is written about
[1:17:39] people that's right that's why Paul said
[1:17:43] you are
[1:17:47] what
[1:17:48] yep
[1:17:50] Epistles written right that's right see
[1:17:53] we we turn it around and I know I do
[1:17:55] most of the time anyway but it's really
[1:17:56] I think the correct way saying his epist
[1:17:58] epistle is written
[1:17:59] right in our
[1:18:03] heart it's not just something
[1:18:07] written it's written about what people
[1:18:09] on
[1:18:11] Earth that's what I've tried to get you
[1:18:13] to see you said well we can look back
[1:18:15] and we can see this age we can look back
[1:18:17] and we can see this age we can look back
[1:18:18] and we can see this age in the Bible y
[1:18:21] well the Book of Revelation show was our
[1:18:23] age cuz this is the age when God is
[1:18:26] going to reveal the entire Book of
[1:18:28] Revelation amen we know what's going to
[1:18:30] take place to the Armageddon the the you
[1:18:35] know Gog and Magog the Millennium the
[1:18:39] white Throne judgment the the future
[1:18:43] home why because it's been made known to
[1:18:46] us all right but now follow what I'm
[1:18:49] trying to get
[1:18:51] to so then the The book must be
[1:18:55] completed and then it's sealed right all
[1:18:59] right now we look at it and we read seal
[1:19:03] number one seal number two seal number
[1:19:05] three now that was what was written
[1:19:08] about the book right but the actual seal
[1:19:12] is in the time of of Israel in the
[1:19:16] tribulation exactly
[1:19:21] amen you said
[1:19:23] yeah I know it because the seals reveal
[1:19:25] what was what is and what will be the
[1:19:28] seals reveal the Antichrist that starts
[1:19:30] down in the ages right right but the
[1:19:33] Antichrist is not the
[1:19:35] sealed amen Jesus Christ is the sealed
[1:19:39] amen that's right and where he's at is
[1:19:41] in the people to combat those things
[1:19:45] that are coming forth I'm talking about
[1:19:47] writing of the book all right now John
[1:19:50] was told to write back there and he was
[1:19:53] told to write what he saw right so sure
[1:19:55] now John looked
[1:19:59] down to see the age we're in
[1:20:04] wonderful and he wrote about
[1:20:08] it he marveled at that white righteous
[1:20:11] church that was there because it was
[1:20:14] even so great till it till John got
[1:20:17] caught up in it amen right see looking
[1:20:21] at those things but get the point point
[1:20:22] now what I'm trying to
[1:20:24] bring see because the
[1:20:28] bride is part of the
[1:20:30] book cuz the book is really about
[1:20:34] her even though you would be talking as
[1:20:37] I said about the Armageddon tribulation
[1:20:41] go and Magog uh White thr judgment and
[1:20:45] the future
[1:20:46] home you find that each one of those is
[1:20:50] showing
[1:20:51] you that
[1:20:53] what God is doing for his bride upon
[1:20:56] Earth right now cuz he's revealing those
[1:21:02] things he's revealing those things that
[1:21:04] will happen to Israel because what is it
[1:21:08] U mzd when he came to Abraham said can I
[1:21:11] withhold anything from Abraham seeing
[1:21:14] he's the air of Salvation so he couldn't
[1:21:16] withhold it he can't keep anything away
[1:21:18] from his bride right he wants his bride
[1:21:21] to see it and to see what part we are
[1:21:24] now you're I gave you some quotes where
[1:21:26] that we could just see some
[1:21:29] see the book is
[1:21:31] sealed that's the breach page
[1:21:34] 79 1963 through1
[1:21:37] 17e the book is sealed and you are
[1:21:40] sealed with a
[1:21:41] book until the day of
[1:21:46] redemption the book is
[1:21:48] sealed and you're
[1:21:51] sealed
[1:21:54] all right now think about
[1:21:57] that the book is
[1:22:00] sealed so we talk about pulling the
[1:22:02] seals off and looking at the
[1:22:04] book all right
[1:22:08] now are we not part of the mystery
[1:22:11] that's right amen are we not to be
[1:22:13] revealed is that not according to the
[1:22:15] next two quotes I gave you from Christ
[1:22:16] of mystery God
[1:22:20] revealed that the bride is part of the
[1:22:23] mystery it's impossible for her to not
[1:22:26] go it's part of God's mystery how God
[1:22:29] revealed himself here and raised it up
[1:22:32] by the word s of reveals the church and
[1:22:35] raises it up by the same word it's part
[1:22:37] of his threefold mystery what was it all
[1:22:40] God was he put into Christ all Christ in
[1:22:43] the
[1:22:44] church she's part of the
[1:22:47] Myster all right now that's page 74
[1:22:50] going down to
[1:22:51] 75 of Christ the mystery watch what he
[1:22:55] says see the seals when he was in his
[1:22:57] mediatorial work back there redeeming
[1:23:00] but someday he comes to get this book
[1:23:02] that he's redeemed right and all that's
[1:23:05] in this book would be
[1:23:09] him okay I pause there all that's in
[1:23:14] this book would be him now what's him
[1:23:17] right for that's the Believers amen okay
[1:23:20] now that's what he's saying for that's
[1:23:22] the believer right what is that the
[1:23:24] words in the book and the word is him
[1:23:26] and all that's in him he come forth for
[1:23:30] this book of
[1:23:32] redemption
[1:23:34] see it's all about him it's a revelation
[1:23:36] of Jesus
[1:23:38] Christ right all
[1:23:41] right but it shows where he's
[1:23:45] at then the Book of Revelation shows
[1:23:48] that the bride will come to the place as
[1:23:50] I said a minute ago to realize who she
[1:23:57] is because we are the book now think
[1:24:01] about the sealing of the book it was
[1:24:02] sealed back di right y right y that was
[1:24:07] sealed back there all right so you
[1:24:10] listen to what I'm talking about John
[1:24:12] saw it the book was sealed right that's
[1:24:14] right now come on you you understand I'm
[1:24:16] talking about the writing of the book
[1:24:19] all right so back there John saw the
[1:24:21] book and it was
[1:24:23] sealed amen he saw about the church and
[1:24:26] the things he saw the things and wrote
[1:24:29] them down but do you really believe he
[1:24:34] understood you didn't understand the
[1:24:36] seals and the things cuz he wrote a
[1:24:37] symbol right that's
[1:24:40] it he wrote a symbol that's right he
[1:24:43] didn't understand now he understood a
[1:24:46] whole lot more than probably me and you
[1:24:47] yeah
[1:24:50] okay but see because the book had not
[1:24:53] been completed on Earth yet right now
[1:24:56] the book that's going to be
[1:24:59] sealed is the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:25:03] right amen the
[1:25:07] word and then it will go to Israel to be
[1:25:10] released to them amen right what
[1:25:15] book the book of the Bride right the
[1:25:19] book of the children of God Amen coming
[1:25:22] all the way through from Genesis all the
[1:25:24] way through see the children of God all
[1:25:26] right so then when Israel gets the book
[1:25:29] they don't have to have this to read you
[1:25:32] know what I'm saying they're not going
[1:25:34] to be reading the prophet's message as
[1:25:36] we think you know this message will go
[1:25:37] to Israel no they just go over there and
[1:25:40] tell them the truth of what happened
[1:25:41] right read in the seal book about I
[1:25:44] don't know it's somewhere 470 something
[1:25:46] but it's on the seventh seal and notice
[1:25:48] what the prophet would be covering how
[1:25:50] that they will tell them
[1:25:52] said you missed it that's right you
[1:25:56] missed this point but said the bride
[1:25:59] received
[1:26:01] it we are the book that'll go to Israel
[1:26:04] amen that's
[1:26:06] right amen but it's got to be completed
[1:26:08] before it can go to Israel because
[1:26:10] that's the one it can take now the
[1:26:12] opening of the seals back
[1:26:14] there see the the
[1:26:17] seals they were sealed up Y and would be
[1:26:21] waiting for the end time to be
[1:26:23] open and we are the book then that's
[1:26:26] sealed when it's complete see then it's
[1:26:30] sealed all right see you and I when this
[1:26:33] is completed and we go out of here in a
[1:26:35] Rapture the book will be sealed up until
[1:26:38] that time of us right all right and then
[1:26:43] it'll be open to Israel
[1:26:46] yes right right to tell them about us
[1:26:51] right and how they turn down the sunship
[1:26:54] there in rejecting Jesus
[1:26:58] Christ but yet the bride received
[1:27:01] it and he went into
[1:27:03] Glory see see there's a lot of
[1:27:06] difference in the writing of the book
[1:27:08] and the revealing of the
[1:27:10] book there's 2,000 years between the
[1:27:13] time John wrote it and that brother
[1:27:15] randam could come and preach the seals
[1:27:17] you know right at it 1925 or something
[1:27:20] years whatever you want to be technical
[1:27:25] but see the prophet said the book is
[1:27:29] sealed and you are sealed with the book
[1:27:32] right right did you see what he's
[1:27:34] talking about
[1:27:37] yes and the Holy Ghost is the only one
[1:27:40] that can reveal cuz there's only one
[1:27:43] seal and that's the Holy Ghost all
[1:27:46] right there's seven Parts in the bases
[1:27:49] is like the seven spirits of God
[1:27:52] but that's not seven spirits that's one
[1:27:54] God in seven manifestation the seals are
[1:27:57] Seven Seals revealing the revelation of
[1:28:00] Jesus Christ not the Antichrist that's
[1:28:02] what you ask people say what's seal
[1:28:04] number one Antichrist well that's not
[1:28:07] so see number one is the revelation of
[1:28:09] one true and living God right amen
[1:28:12] that's right to where you can see the
[1:28:13] Antichrist riding off
[1:28:15] amen cuz that's how brother Rand you he
[1:28:17] said see that guy see that other fell
[1:28:19] cuz if another fell you got two people
[1:28:21] you got two people you got to have the
[1:28:22] Antichrist cuz he ain't two people about
[1:28:24] God there
[1:28:26] persons there's only one true and living
[1:28:28] God but see she's part of the
[1:28:31] mystery all right who him that's in her
[1:28:36] right making her the Believers in the
[1:28:41] book and it's not completed yet to be
[1:28:44] able to go to Israel
[1:28:47] right now listen to what I'm
[1:28:50] saying the book is not complete yet to
[1:28:52] go to Israel why we must complete it
[1:28:55] upon earth
[1:28:58] right and once we walk off the earth in
[1:29:01] a Rapture is what I was getting at the
[1:29:03] other day see then the book can go to
[1:29:06] Israel right but the book is sealed to
[1:29:09] them right now cuz they can't see it
[1:29:12] that's
[1:29:13] right right it's over their eyes they're
[1:29:16] blinded all right now watch then see
[1:29:20] then we are the word
[1:29:23] that's
[1:29:26] written it'll be written about us now
[1:29:29] you say well be written about us and you
[1:29:31] know you can't write no more to it all
[1:29:33] right then it must be in there to tell
[1:29:35] about us I'm glad you thought of that
[1:29:37] you know they say well you can't no you
[1:29:39] can't add to the book so it must be in
[1:29:41] the book to tell about us so read the
[1:29:44] book to find out about yourself right
[1:29:48] don't go it now get me right I'm saying
[1:29:50] I know I'm hard and strong don't go ask
[1:29:53] Grandma how perfect you are she never
[1:29:55] sees your
[1:29:58] problems you're perfect in her eyes
[1:30:01] that's
[1:30:03] right go ask God what he thinks about
[1:30:06] you you'll find out God is a whole lot
[1:30:09] greater than Grandma cuz Grandma did see
[1:30:11] what you done God when he you forgi ask
[1:30:15] forgiveness he forgives you God don't
[1:30:17] even see what you
[1:30:19] done so I'd rather have God than grandma
[1:30:23] right that's right because a better
[1:30:26] understanding boy I'm getting
[1:30:28] slow get the old age you get really slow
[1:30:30] that's 2 Corinthians 3: 2 where we're
[1:30:33] Epistles written and we're written in
[1:30:35] our and written in our hearts he said
[1:30:38] all right now but see the lamb takes the
[1:30:41] book after it's
[1:30:45] written and looses the seals right and
[1:30:49] makes it known to the bride that's right
[1:30:55] that's got to be made known to the
[1:30:59] bride all right look at the evening
[1:31:02] messenger number four your
[1:31:05] notes after the book is written evening
[1:31:07] messenger 1963
[1:31:10] 1116 after the book is written then it's
[1:31:12] sealed back there with Seven Seals now
[1:31:16] no one
[1:31:17] knows what they
[1:31:20] are after the book is written it's
[1:31:23] sealed everybody's want to talk about
[1:31:27] unsealing you better first see it sealed
[1:31:29] up that's right
[1:31:31] amen and why is it sealed up because the
[1:31:35] only seal I know is the Holy Ghost amen
[1:31:37] phans 4:30 right and the Holy Ghost has
[1:31:41] the book sealed why because he's not
[1:31:43] revealed it to us that's right he's
[1:31:45] revealing it to us now and the revealing
[1:31:48] of the book is revealing Who We Are and
[1:31:52] what God thinks about us now that's been
[1:31:54] the whole message I sure didn't go mean
[1:31:56] to go this way but it's all
[1:31:59] right
[1:32:00] now it shows us where we
[1:32:04] are yep well I just read the
[1:32:08] book all right that's
[1:32:11] good but ask God to reveal
[1:32:15] it
[1:32:16] right you ever do that you ever ask him
[1:32:20] to reveal his word amen yes
[1:32:25] L ever ask him to reveal how perfect you
[1:32:28] are well I just he said I'm perfect so
[1:32:31] I'm perfect all right now that goes to
[1:32:33] one end of the
[1:32:35] scale other end of the scale is well
[1:32:37] there none of us
[1:32:38] perfect somewhere in between there there
[1:32:41] has to be a middle of the
[1:32:42] road you say well I just read that's
[1:32:44] what I mean you just read the book and
[1:32:46] just say what the book
[1:32:50] says now according to science about 50
[1:32:53] years well a little longer than that now
[1:32:54] we got too old about 100 years ago
[1:32:57] science proved if you rolled a ball
[1:32:59] somewhere there about across the Earth
[1:33:01] at 25 M hour you it just pick up and
[1:33:04] leave the Earth you know right because
[1:33:09] that's that's what they thought right
[1:33:11] see they want to make sure to keep it
[1:33:12] like 25 because nobody could run that
[1:33:14] fast it wasn't nothing back there to do
[1:33:17] that but I wonder what why they they
[1:33:18] they never did think about it what if
[1:33:20] you fell off a great big own tall
[1:33:22] building you're going to reach more than
[1:33:24] 25 mph before you hit the bottom but
[1:33:26] they never thought of that that's all
[1:33:27] right I'm just carnal but
[1:33:32] see they proved it right and they wrote
[1:33:36] it in a book you want to read that book
[1:33:39] no we don't want to read that book all
[1:33:43] right so the Catholics come along and
[1:33:45] they wrote a
[1:33:49] book you got to do penance
[1:33:52] you got to crawl so much you got to pay
[1:33:54] so much you got to do so much we don't
[1:33:55] believe that book
[1:33:59] right the Baptist come along and wrote a
[1:34:03] book you got to be baptized in our
[1:34:07] church our ways the Methodist wrote a
[1:34:10] book you got to do this you got to do we
[1:34:12] don't believe them books
[1:34:15] right cuz that's not the word that's
[1:34:18] just like brother Ram said the book of
[1:34:20] mccabes and all of these others the the
[1:34:22] Lost books of Eden the uh uh Aggie's
[1:34:26] Purgatory um the extra books of Daniel
[1:34:29] or whatever it is are he said that just
[1:34:31] won't compare with the rest of the Bible
[1:34:34] right he said so we don't believe that
[1:34:39] right but see I want to believe what the
[1:34:41] Bible says
[1:34:44] amen and the Bible doesn't say go live
[1:34:47] like the devil because God is AD do old
[1:34:49] Granddaddy and don't see your sin it's
[1:34:51] not written that way I'm sorry and if
[1:34:54] you think that's the way it is you got a
[1:34:57] problem well I can just do what I want
[1:34:59] to you know I can cut my hair a little
[1:35:01] bit paint my face a little bit I can
[1:35:02] work you know wrong clothes I can do
[1:35:05] this or whatever the men this that and
[1:35:07] the other you know the Bible's not
[1:35:09] written that way right amen the Bible's
[1:35:12] written about an overcomer that's right
[1:35:15] that's right and each age had
[1:35:18] that but see we not going to fool you're
[1:35:20] not fooling nobody you're fooling your
[1:35:22] own self amen
[1:35:25] now what I want you to look at for a
[1:35:28] minute
[1:35:35] is I don't know exactly how to approach
[1:35:38] this part but I want to get it to
[1:35:40] you we can see then that the Rapture
[1:35:43] takes
[1:35:45] place all right to the bride cuz the
[1:35:47] Bible says it the Bible shows how great
[1:35:51] she is because it shows her as the even
[1:35:54] the lamb coming from her right to take
[1:35:57] the
[1:35:59] book
[1:36:01] now as I said about it the writing of
[1:36:04] the book is one thing the revealing of
[1:36:06] the book is another so the writing of
[1:36:08] the book showed the sealing of the seals
[1:36:10] and the lamb back
[1:36:15] there but it would have to show coming
[1:36:17] down in the end time
[1:36:20] after the seals would be to be revealed
[1:36:24] then it's going to have to be to the
[1:36:25] church the bride first now we're not
[1:36:28] talking about the Israel I've preached
[1:36:30] that okay that's seiling you and I
[1:36:33] that's they're going to see us all right
[1:36:35] but we're going to have to look back and
[1:36:38] see that what that ceiling was back
[1:36:40] there was that God sealed It Up Until
[1:36:43] the End
[1:36:45] time in the writing of the book he
[1:36:47] sealed up the Book of Revelation right
[1:36:50] right
[1:36:52] to wait until the end
[1:36:56] time and it doesn't mean that and I I've
[1:37:01] in no way emphasized that the the lamb
[1:37:05] coming from the church ages I don't
[1:37:07] believe the prophet is trying to
[1:37:09] express how that we give forth as much
[1:37:12] as it's what he
[1:37:14] is he had to wait a time to the writing
[1:37:17] of the book right because in doing that
[1:37:21] there would be no book to go to Israel
[1:37:22] had he not waited until we are
[1:37:25] written you understand the bride so he
[1:37:28] waits until the end time and then when
[1:37:31] he gets in the end time see then he can
[1:37:33] open the seals right now brother brand
[1:37:37] said we're seeing what happened in glory
[1:37:38] 2,000 years ago right amen back there
[1:37:42] but you see it wasn't brother brandham
[1:37:44] turning off the
[1:37:46] seals no
[1:37:49] no right and yet he was confused on
[1:37:52] those points right because he couldn't
[1:37:55] see it correctly and him being a prophet
[1:37:58] right right cuz he says we were
[1:38:01] listening to the breach last night he
[1:38:02] says
[1:38:03] that I don't know what those seals are
[1:38:07] that's right he said well he was just
[1:38:08] lying to you well then he's a lying
[1:38:10] prophet and that would make the wrong
[1:38:11] thing I don't believe that I believe he
[1:38:14] was right and he said he didn't see it
[1:38:15] cuz he got down on the first seal he
[1:38:17] said I was going to make a horrible
[1:38:19] mistake said because I was going to
[1:38:20] follow old
[1:38:22] notes you know Y and he said the Holy
[1:38:25] Ghost came in the room straightened him
[1:38:27] out all right and he saw the opening of
[1:38:30] the seals
[1:38:32] what
[1:38:34] after he saw the one true and living
[1:38:38] God if you'll
[1:38:41] notice when brother randam came back to
[1:38:44] Jeffersonville he did not know what the
[1:38:45] seals were that's right they were just
[1:38:48] you know what we think he walked out the
[1:38:50] first night and said well
[1:38:51] I'm just here I'll just I'll just take a
[1:38:53] topic preach well just preach one God
[1:38:57] I'll just take a
[1:38:59] topic and then he says
[1:39:01] well you know I can't get across our so
[1:39:04] I I just see a breach
[1:39:06] here you know try this preach right a
[1:39:10] breach you know I don't think so
[1:39:17] right I believe when he came
[1:39:20] back he done exactly what he was
[1:39:22] supposed to
[1:39:25] do he preached one true and living
[1:39:30] God you might ought to read the god in
[1:39:33] simplic you know the god in
[1:39:35] Simplicity and then the breach with this
[1:39:38] understanding with way going into the
[1:39:40] seals it would be good for you to read
[1:39:41] it this way read that God in Simplicity
[1:39:44] as being in the bases that he could
[1:39:47] stand on when it come over to the first
[1:39:50] seal and and the Holy Ghost could say
[1:39:52] what have you always preached he said
[1:39:54] have always preached one true and living
[1:39:56] God Jesus and the father is a self Same
[1:39:59] Spirit he said well okay now there goes
[1:40:01] the white horse rider another
[1:40:05] guy all right now what
[1:40:10] happened what
[1:40:14] happened brother brandom was dealing
[1:40:16] with revealing what was written in the
[1:40:19] book
[1:40:22] okay in the book he saw a
[1:40:28] lamb and he saw a lamb that was
[1:40:33] worthy so he talks about it being that
[1:40:37] it was and the lamb comes
[1:40:39] forth he doesn't speak there as much
[1:40:42] about the lamb coming from the church
[1:40:45] ages as he does after the seals break
[1:40:50] check me out
[1:40:52] then he begins to speak of where the
[1:40:53] lamb came
[1:40:56] from so now you're dealing with where
[1:40:59] the lamb would come from to
[1:41:02] reveal cuz it's already written and
[1:41:06] where the lamb would come from to go to
[1:41:08] Israel
[1:41:12] right all right Follow Me Now Jesus
[1:41:15] Christ is that lamb that was back there
[1:41:18] that
[1:41:19] lamb was signified as having seven horns
[1:41:23] and seven eyes that's right because it
[1:41:25] would mean then in the church ages that
[1:41:28] lamb would be produced by the bride that
[1:41:31] would be able to break the seals when
[1:41:34] you're going to
[1:41:37] Israel now that may me a little for some
[1:41:40] of you you may not think about it much
[1:41:42] but you know it just gives me something
[1:41:45] to tie together that I can see to go all
[1:41:47] the way across with it cuz you got to
[1:41:49] have a lamb to take the book to to take
[1:41:51] this to
[1:41:54] Israel you remember we going to give
[1:41:56] birth to
[1:41:57] who remember in the Old Testament they
[1:41:59] gave birth to Jesus Christ right now do
[1:42:02] you remember the message I preached we
[1:42:05] are to give birth to the grain of
[1:42:08] wheat the son of
[1:42:12] man because he can't go to Israel under
[1:42:16] that condition of Son of
[1:42:19] God
[1:42:21] he's going to have to go to Israel
[1:42:23] through two prophets right then they
[1:42:26] will see Son of God Son of Man son of
[1:42:29] David yes but he's going there to
[1:42:32] through two prophets the son of man
[1:42:35] that's going there is going to be the
[1:42:37] word made flesh right which as I said a
[1:42:40] moment ago and you were with me so let's
[1:42:42] see if you stay with me that we are the
[1:42:46] book we are the book that's going to
[1:42:48] Israel you following me amen
[1:42:51] we are the book that's going to Israel
[1:42:56] right we are the revealed word now I
[1:42:59] didn't say what everybody says about it
[1:43:02] I know in this message a great man
[1:43:04] preached and told me about it one time
[1:43:05] and he said them two prophets said
[1:43:07] that's going to be the a gentile prophet
[1:43:09] and a bride Gentile
[1:43:11] bride they're going to go to Israel for
[1:43:13] the Rapture now I didn't say that that's
[1:43:17] what somebody else said in the day he
[1:43:18] told me that you know what I said I said
[1:43:20] brother r said it' be two Jews so you do
[1:43:22] what you want
[1:43:24] to amen now brother R said they won't
[1:43:27] receive nothing but two Jews that's
[1:43:31] right but brother Dale Elijah was a
[1:43:34] gentile was Elisha a
[1:43:38] gentile no right Elisha was an
[1:43:42] Israelite was John the Baptist a
[1:43:47] gentile no John the Baptist was a Jew
[1:43:54] see everybody thinks they get something
[1:43:56] they line it up in their mind looks so
[1:43:57] beautiful you know it's got to be a
[1:43:59] gentile brother around and said be two
[1:44:01] Jews go to Israel that's right
[1:44:04] amen well I always thought Elijah was a
[1:44:06] gentile
[1:44:08] and he
[1:44:10] was but Elisha wouldn't John the Baptist
[1:44:15] wouldn't and them two over there won't
[1:44:18] be just put that in there won't you
[1:44:21] charie you see I have to think things
[1:44:24] over because I'm thinking in my mind all
[1:44:27] the
[1:44:28] time how that I can present something to
[1:44:31] you to keep it from being confused with
[1:44:34] other people's
[1:44:37] doctrines I don't believe the bride is
[1:44:39] going to go through Israel for the
[1:44:41] rapture we are Israel we are in Goan
[1:44:44] we're right now this is spiritual Israel
[1:44:47] brother randam was a spiritual Jew right
[1:44:50] we are Gentiles but we Are Spiritual
[1:44:52] Jews that's right right greater than the
[1:44:56] natural Jews Jew means God's chosen okay
[1:44:59] get
[1:45:01] on but follow
[1:45:04] me see the book is sealed back there
[1:45:08] John sees a
[1:45:12] lamb and writes about
[1:45:15] it it would have to have a meaning to be
[1:45:17] totally back there as the opening of the
[1:45:20] seal
[1:45:22] and then it would have to have a meaning
[1:45:23] in the end time to the opening of seals
[1:45:26] to take it to Israel that's why why
[1:45:28] Revelations 10:7 people don't understand
[1:45:30] it says one you know that stand one foot
[1:45:33] on land one on
[1:45:34] sea I'm not going to get there this
[1:45:36] message but I'll get to it later the
[1:45:40] bride goes up Revelation 4:1 and not
[1:45:41] seen till 1921
[1:45:45] right but Revelations 10:1 the prophet
[1:45:47] said is the same thing as Revelations
[1:45:49] 1:13 right that's his quote I wouldn't
[1:45:52] know what I had to say about
[1:45:54] it but listen let me get on this in
[1:45:59] hurry see the
[1:46:02] lamb had to come forth to take the
[1:46:06] book right John saw that and he wrote it
[1:46:10] right right he saw a lamb come forth
[1:46:14] that wasn't a lamb with seven horns and
[1:46:16] seven eyes that was Jesus Christ right
[1:46:20] you'll notice in the reading there about
[1:46:22] the lamb coming to take the book it says
[1:46:24] he brother R said this is not a lamb
[1:46:26] said it's not that he said it's a man
[1:46:31] y all right because no man was
[1:46:34] worthy to take the book right the lamb
[1:46:38] was a
[1:46:39] man all right now that would be back
[1:46:42] there in the writing of the book and you
[1:46:44] see in the opening of the book but when
[1:46:45] you come down to this end time it's in
[1:46:47] Bride
[1:46:49] form
[1:46:50] she see she has seen in there seven
[1:46:53] golden
[1:46:54] candlesticks seven eyes seven horns
[1:46:57] getting ready to go to Israel from here
[1:47:00] from you and I it's going to Israel
[1:47:02] right all right but you see she's
[1:47:05] already shown in
[1:47:06] heaven let me see if I can get this in a
[1:47:09] hurry
[1:47:12] then the prophet as I said he
[1:47:14] misunderstood the seals he didn't know
[1:47:16] what they
[1:47:17] were do you know that even after the the
[1:47:20] uh in the seal book even after the seals
[1:47:23] were preached and in questions and
[1:47:25] answers he still messed up
[1:47:29] right he read Revelations 5 and said
[1:47:32] that is not the
[1:47:35] bride because his thoughts was that she
[1:47:38] goes up in Revelation 4:1 not seen until
[1:47:40] 19:21 he said that in a seal
[1:47:42] B so when he reads Revelations 5 I gave
[1:47:46] it to is number five and then goes on
[1:47:48] through a whole quote of number six
[1:47:51] of the seal book and when they asked him
[1:47:54] they said brother Brandon in Revelations
[1:47:56] vers
[1:47:58] revelations in Revelations verse 5 to9
[1:48:01] who are those found singing with the
[1:48:03] lamb the book takes it are these the
[1:48:05] raptured Saints he says
[1:48:09] no no that's not the Rapture
[1:48:15] Saints even after he's done seen the
[1:48:18] seagull and everything cuz see his mind
[1:48:20] is on
[1:48:21] Earth the Bri's not seen on Earth from
[1:48:24] Revelation 4:1 to 19:21 all right so
[1:48:27] brother Ned Ivon was the one that said
[1:48:30] to brother randam and I gave it on down
[1:48:32] through here to you and it's on the
[1:48:33] internet with the notes you can read it
[1:48:35] cuz it's it's a page uh starts at 500
[1:48:39] through 501 on over to 502 and I think
[1:48:43] it goes to 503 yeah
[1:48:46] 502 of the seal book the questions and
[1:48:49] answers
[1:48:51] they asked him that question was that to
[1:48:52] bride he says
[1:48:58] no but then he turns around and
[1:49:00] something goes wrong he says there's
[1:49:01] something
[1:49:03] wrong there's a problem there something
[1:49:06] wrong he stops and backwards and forth
[1:49:08] read down to there he's going through he
[1:49:10] can't figure it out brother Ned Iverson
[1:49:12] said cuz I know that's he told me that's
[1:49:15] who it
[1:49:16] was he said read your question over when
[1:49:19] he read question over he said see there
[1:49:22] look said the holy spirit is keeping me
[1:49:24] straight he said this is not this is the
[1:49:27] bride he said c Us in glory and we'll
[1:49:29] reign as kings and Priests C Us in glory
[1:49:33] see he already seen her there in the
[1:49:37] Rapture all right now I gave you the
[1:49:39] notes to where that you can go with it
[1:49:41] of the seal book and where the the uh
[1:49:44] church is absolutely raptured and she's
[1:49:46] not seen between Revelations 4:1 and
[1:49:49] 19:21 that's what I said you said a
[1:49:51] moment ago you know I say well you said
[1:49:53] well what about Revelation

[1:50:03] people well you know that's talking
[1:50:05] about

[1:50:10] me right Revelations 10 1-7 you said
[1:50:14] well that's brother brandom brother
[1:50:16] brandom said it was the same as
[1:50:18] Revelations
[1:50:19] 1113
[1:50:21] one standing in the midst of seven
[1:50:22] golden candlesticks where about the pass
[1:50:24] with the golden girl he's standing one
[1:50:26] foot on land one on sea
[1:50:30] people you say yes but but but brother
[1:50:33] Dale this Revelation I've always said
[1:50:34] Revelation not Revelation 107 was
[1:50:36] brother
[1:50:38] brandom it is in the basis of the
[1:50:41] bringing of the
[1:50:42] Revelation but it's going to Israel from
[1:50:47] here they must have a part of Revelation
[1:50:50] aans 10:7 that's right the days of the
[1:50:54] voice 10:7 what of the seventh angel
[1:50:57] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[1:50:58] of God should be revealed you know as
[1:51:01] revealed to his s but if you'll notice
[1:51:03] the word it starts
[1:51:07] with what's the first word that's in
[1:51:09] Revelations
[1:51:13] 10:7 I just quoted over it but I didn't
[1:51:16] say the word it says but in the days of
[1:51:21] the voice of the seventh angel John is
[1:51:24] taken all the way over to see this and
[1:51:26] writes and he said how in the world am I
[1:51:28] going to get these seals back to the
[1:51:32] bride that don't put brother brandom
[1:51:34] over there no they don't put us over
[1:51:37] there right he said but in the days in
[1:51:41] other words but in the days he's looking
[1:51:43] back cuz he sees the seventh Church age
[1:51:45] Messenger as a prophet right but in the
[1:51:48] days of the voice of the seventh Angel
[1:51:50] when he shall begin to say and all the
[1:51:52] Mysteries will be
[1:51:54] completed it don't put us over there
[1:52:01] amen because we go up in Revelation 4:1
[1:52:05] well don't brother random go up with
[1:52:09] us Revelations
[1:52:12] 10:7 sure shows you the seventh angel
[1:52:16] messenger
[1:52:18] yes but it CHS him as the basis to where
[1:52:21] it says but the mind of John goes back
[1:52:23] to Revelation
[1:52:26] 3:14 the angel of the Church of lady
[1:52:29] right right
[1:52:32] right and he says Now the secrets can be
[1:52:35] made known to the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:52:37] by way of the seventh
[1:52:41] angel did we sat in a meeting one time
[1:52:44] about that and some people there boy
[1:52:45] they were just you have seen them
[1:52:46] passing notes to me about it and I said
[1:52:49] but brother you don't understand you're
[1:52:51] tearing up the message cuz the prophet
[1:52:54] said it
[1:52:56] y he said the bride goes up Revelation
[1:52:59] 4:1 and not seen until
[1:53:05] 1921 but see it shows how perfect we are
[1:53:07] folks get that I I'll leave the rest of
[1:53:10] it I'll come back to it sometime maybe
[1:53:12] review this afternoon
[1:53:14] that I wish youd take this message and
[1:53:17] listen to it over again go I said some
[1:53:20] things in it that I didn't intend to say
[1:53:22] and really I didn't know how it would go
[1:53:26] together because you got to write the
[1:53:29] book and then there's got to be a book
[1:53:31] Made
[1:53:33] Alive the book that was written back
[1:53:37] there is now made alive in the Bride of
[1:53:40] Jesus
[1:53:41] Christ the words in the book which is
[1:53:44] Christ through all the church ages now
[1:53:46] it can go to Israel from here amen once
[1:53:50] we leave out of here the same book they
[1:53:52] don't have to get another uh you know
[1:53:55] edition of the
[1:53:57] Bible you take this book but to Israel
[1:54:00] will be shown that this book is Made
[1:54:04] Alive by the Bride of Jesus
[1:54:07] Christ right the Living Word is Christ
[1:54:10] in
[1:54:11] her right that's what it's showing
[1:54:13] showing her going into Rapture in
[1:54:14] chapter 4 shows her in chapter
[1:54:18] 5
[1:54:21] as Saints shouting Glory Hallelujah and
[1:54:24] singing come on musician singing and
[1:54:31] worshiping showing her and how perfect
[1:54:34] she is you don't know how perfect he is
[1:54:36] read the book of Revelation you know how
[1:54:38] perfect you are correct English you know
[1:54:41] read the book of
[1:54:44] Revelations look at the Book of
[1:54:46] Revelations and see who you
[1:54:48] are
[1:54:51] well I don't know it's all in symbols
[1:54:52] well then ask the prophet what the
[1:54:54] symbols
[1:54:55] mean right
[1:54:58] right I mean after 40 Years of studying
[1:55:00] the message we ought to be down to the
[1:55:02] basis we know what the symbols are right
[1:55:05] or maybe we don't get it by reading G
[1:55:09] omic you
[1:55:12] know our love story magazines and
[1:55:15] things or
[1:55:18] newspapers
[1:55:20] you don't find a revelation of Jesus
[1:55:23] Christ you might find them talking about
[1:55:25] something brother Randon said one of
[1:55:27] these days they'll put it in the comic
[1:55:28] strips well you've seen the comic strips
[1:55:30] where be who were the the little fell
[1:55:33] you know there the Snoopy and peanuts
[1:55:37] and one of them said but I thought
[1:55:38] Elijah was supposed to come that's right
[1:55:41] it was written in the comic strips right
[1:55:43] guy was going through with a sign the
[1:55:44] end of the world here and he said but I
[1:55:46] thought Elijah was to come he said
[1:55:47] you'll read it in in the comic strips
[1:55:49] right then you have let's Stand Together
[1:55:52] amen but think about these
[1:55:55] things raptured Saints raptured bride or
[1:55:59] bride in
[1:56:02] heaven because that's where we are now
[1:56:06] right I thought we believe that we were
[1:56:08] resurrected sitting in Heavenly places
[1:56:11] that's right in Christ
[1:56:15] Jesus already
[1:56:18] raised I is don't feel like it that's
[1:56:20] where you're going by your feelings keep
[1:56:22] on you'll just die and go by the
